WPIC Lab

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Governor Milton Shapp has been
called by labor officials to intervene
in the pending court case between
Pitt and the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board (PLRB) over
unionization of Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC).
Pitt is contesting the election of
Local 1199 of the Union of Hospital
and Health Care Workers as the
negotiating agent for the dietary,
 housekeeping, (maintenance and
psychiatric aide staffs. The case is
due before Commonwealth court in
early September.

Shapphas been called upon to
halt litigation because tax money is
being incorrectly spent to prevent
the entrance of the union at WPIC,
said Local 1199 President John
Black.

Attempts were made to enlist
Shapp's help. but so far there has
been no gesture from Harrisburg,
according to Black.

“We're being ignoéd. We’ve
sent telegrams to the Governor
asking for his help and received
nothing. We’re waiting for a reply
to a last urgent telegram. If we
receive no answer we're going to
bring people up there and picket
the Capitol."

' The workers at WPIC have been
trapped between two warring state
institutions according to Black,
without a voice in the decision
which will directly affect them.

"The issue here is that they're
L 4 using tax money on both ends of

the tight, both the University and
the State Labor Board. Any
institution has the right to contest a
labor decision. but in this case
they’re using public money.

“We want them to stop using

Impeachment Factors

President Nixon

 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
With the Senate Watergate
Hearings and much of the Special
Prosecutor's investigation now a
significant part of history. the
meticulous impeachment inquiry

conducted by the House Judiciary .

Committee, too. is grinding to a
halt.

According to the chairman,
Representative Peter W. Rodino
[D-NJ] the Committee expects to
vote on proposed articles of
impeachment by July 26, only nine
days away.

Key Democrats have formed a
four-man study group. headed by
Rodino. to draft proposed articles
of impeachment against President
Nixon.

If the committee votes articles of

of their lives. according to local
educational and financial officials.

Approximately 12 students have
taken this course so far at Pitt, said
Loan Collection Officer Francis T.

Cendar: “We’re getting between 5 '

and 8 per year, and since there is a
six month‘waiting period some are
still pending before the courts.

Although declaring bankruptcy
may seem’ like a quick. easy way
out of an overwhelming debt, the
long-range effects on the student
are only harmful, according to
Harry Englehart of Mellon Bank;
N.A. - -

"The individual may find it
difficult to establish credit, obtain a
home mortgage, or acquire prop-
erty." said Englehart. “In fact, a
bankruptcy history may follow a
person during his lifetime and even
affect the disposition of his estate
upon death."

The federal government requests
the schools use “all due diligence”
in enforcing- the repayment of
loans, according to Cendar. This
includes the use of collection
agencies and legal action against
the debtors.

In addition to the use of
collection agencies‘ and proposed
legal action. Pitt protects itself
through administrative channels.
The first step in collections, said
Cendar. is the placing of University
“stop orders" against academic

records. It is at the discretion of
University officials whether tran-
scripts. a diploma, or other
documents will be withheld from
the graduate.

As the problem of student
bankruptcies becomes more wide-
spread and more annoying to the
loan programs. federal and state
legislation may be enacted to
prohibit students from declaring
bankruptcy for a certain period
such as ﬁve years after graduation.

“I feel that there should be
controls,” said Cendar. “Anyone
can declare bankruptcy, and the
courts usually rule in their favor,
since when you come out of school
your liabilities usually do exceed
your assets. But this move will be
detrimental to you personally.”

Cendar stated although the
number of bankruptcies is on the

rise. delinquent accounts are not‘
following this trend.

“Delinquent accounts are in-
creasing proportionally with the
volume of loans, but not more.
Delinquency usually stems from a
true inability to pay fast enough, or
from trouble with the initial
payment.

“One of the things the student
agrees to when he signs for the
loan, is an interview after gradua-
tion setting up a repayment

for two years. At the end of the two
year term the new justice would
submit his legislative record to the
voters for re-election on a “yes" or
“no" referendum.

“The failing in the present
system is the ease with which any
attorney can become a candidate
for election simply by submitting
an application with the required
number of names." said Samuel
Strauss. Administrative Judge of
the Criminal Division of the
Common -Pleas Court of Allegheny
County.

“In Allegheny County only 200
names are required to become a
candidate for election as a judge of
Common Pleas Court. This means
that we canhave any number of
people running for one vacancy.
The voters can't be expected to sort
out the records of each candidate if
there are 35 or 40 persons running,
so the election process becomes
strictly a political thing.

Strauss said. “It will remove the
random selection factor and insti-
tute some basic qualiﬁcations into
the selection process."

“We‘re trying to get hysteria
and politicking out of the elec-
tions," Schneider said. “If this
new system goes through. judges
will have to depend on their
lcarnedness in the law rather than
on their political connections for
re-election."

The Bill must be passed in July
in order to become effective in
1975, Schneider said. If not passed
this month, a legal requirement
that two sessions of the legislature
must vote on the bill will mean that
HB 2044 cannot be put into practice
before 1977, he reported.

Earlier this week the'bill was on
the “Third reading postponed"
list. according to
Reference Center at l-larrisburg.

for a replacement to Cheever.
Cheever will retire after 24 years
with the University as Professor of
Microbiology inthe Graduate
School of Public Health. Dean of
the School of Medicine, and most
recently as \Vice-Chancellor of

tive August 31 to become Professor
of Pediatrics at Case Western
Reserve and the Director of
Pediatrics at Cayouga. County

The dean formally notified
Cheever and Chancellor Posvar in
June of his impending resignation.

Medearis cited as reason for his
resignation his interest in pediat-
rics. “lam resigning because I
want to return to pediatrics," he
said. He refused to comment
further saying. “I have interest in
how this University operates. I
don't think it's in anybody's

The recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Intramural

 Sports and Recreational Facilities should succeed in alleviating
‘ immediate recreational problems by September when most students
 will be returning to Pitt, even though a long term solution to the
, problems of intramural sports and recreational facilities is still a
 subject of study. '

T The ad hoc committee has been meeting since last winter and has
come up with a list of six immediate improvements. Work has already
begun on the paddleball, handball, and squash courts. Hours at Trees

V ' Hall and the Field House will be lengthened and a checkout station for

recreational equipment funded by the University will be located in

-V_. Schenley Hall. Plans are being rriade to turn the enclosed area across

Fifth Avenue from the Towers adjacent to-the Frick Elementary School
into tennis courts. These proposals are directly related to improving
recreational facilities on campus.

Other proposals dealing with intramlnals should help ease the
administrative problens which‘ plagued Pitt’s intramural programs

over the last years.

Lights will be installed at the stadium for intramural night football,
soccer, and recreational track. Most importantly a suggestion offered
by Leo Bemis, Director of lntramurals, last Feburary has ﬁnally been

i accepted. Pitt will hire a full time assistant intramural director along

with four part time assistants. Training sessions for referees are

 already being planned.

These attempts should go along way to removing some of the basic

 problems with ~Pitt’_s intramural program. Balls, clocks, and whistles
, ’ should be readily available as well as information concerning available
 facilities due to the administrative improvements. A referree training

program indicates a commitment on the part of the Intramural Director

A  to insure the appearance of referrees at all intramural games.

But when the committee begins meeting again in September, it must
address itself to possible long range improvements.

Serious thought should be given in these meetings to removing the
intramural program from the direction of the athletic department.

5‘ - ’ Pitt’s intramural program should not be tied in temis of progression to

the success or failure of the University’s athletic program.
lntramurals should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Student

Affairs Ofﬁce. This is the logical area since it is an activity involving

the participation of students and student groups, which are already

 coordinated by the Student Affairs Staff.

Vlfith continued work and dedication among the committee members

5 , along with a University commitment to improve both the intramural
 program and recreational facilities, the Ad Hoc Committee on

Intramural Sports and Recreational Facilities will be able to, in the

' words of Dr. Charles Coble, committee chaimian, “develop a long

range plan that will represent a ﬁrst rate program at Pitt.”

Saving Arsenal

Pitt administrators have apparently realized the University’s
commitment to the Arsenal Family and Children’s Center after
ordering last March the closing of the center for ﬁnancial reasons.

Pitt announced March 8 in a memo to the Arsenal Staff the Center _

would have to close because it required a commitment‘ of funds to cover
the Center’s expected operating deﬁcit for the ﬁscal year ’74-’75. The
decision by Pitt’s administrators stirred protest within the
Lawrenceville community and on campus demanding the
administration realize it had an obligation to maintain Arseanl Center
for both educational and social service purposes.

 that span of time Pitt pledged it would continue to provide the
facultyrequiredtostaﬁ'theCenteriftlieneededfundsbecame
available. The University succeeded in its attempts to gain outside
funding for Arsenal with the assistance and pressure of the Center’s

' Mother’s Club.

Pitt has signed an interim contract with the State Department of
Public Welfare giving Arsenal $50,000 to cover operating costs during
the coming year, ensuring the Center’s operation until J urie 30, 1975.

Additionally, efforts have been made to obtain pemianent funding
for Arsenal Center. State Senator Frank Mazzei has introduced
legislation into the legislature to insure funding for Arsenal as a line
item in Pitt’s annual state appropriation.

After months of bitter debate concerning this issue the University
has recognized Arsenal Center’s contributions to the community by
searching for avenues which would maintain the center’s operation.
Pitt administrators have also become aware of the center’s beneﬁts to
students as practical working experience in the child care ﬁeld, and the
potential beneﬁts of the research gathered there over the years.

All who attempted to maintain the Center as a viable program at Pitt
should be commended for their efforts. Among these are Pitt’s
administrators, who ultimately reversed the decision, the Arsenal
Center’s Mother’s Club and Pitt students participating in the Arsenal
program, who have fought since the administration's original decision,
and Bruce Keeler, Student Government Board member who succeeded
in making Student Government aware of its responsibility in
supporting Arsenal Center’s efforts to remain open.

At long last the University community can take pride in the fact that

Pitt’s administrators recognized and responded fairly to a crisis
involving students, adrnimstrators, and faculty: the beleagured

Distrust anda Puppet Press

BY TOM SMITH

The English department has
been involved in a serious dispute
with FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
in recent months because of his
tenure decisions for three English
faculty members. What has
emerged, though, from this inci-
dent is a pervading atmosphere
which should frighten all facets of
the University community--espec-
ially the student population.

Rcsenberg's decision was to
deny tenure to Christopher Rawson
and defer the cases of Mary Briscoe
and Ronald Curran. Robert
Hinman, the department chairman
has been in consultation with the
Dean seeking to either reverse or
modify that original decision.

Throughout the dispute many
members of the department,
primarily its chairman, who had
threatened to resign over the crisis,
have been reluctant to discuss the
situation. The May 30 Pitt News
reported Dr. Robert Gale of the
department saying the faculty were
“cautioned by both administrators
and the chairman not to talk.”

That position was reaffirmed by
the chairman at a June 5 meeting.
The department's rationale for this
position was such publicity would
endanger the three candidates‘

chances of a successful review of -

their tenure cases by Rosenberg.

A graduate teaching assistant
refused to discuss the matter "for
fear of “being socially ostracized"
by the department faculty. It is
amazing such infantile ideas would
be expressed by someone prepar-
ing to assume a teaching role at a
higher learning institution.

At the same time Rosenberg,
who will ultimately make the ﬁnal
decision on a reversal or modifica-
tion of his original recommenda-
tion, has not been pleased with the
publicity given the situation appar-
ently because of his sensitivity to
confidentiality in tenure cases.

The issue in this incident is the
possible damage publicity can do

    English tenure cases

to the three tenure cases. The
department says such publicity will
wreak havoc on the individuals
involved--that the dean will take
into account the fact that such
publicity has occurred. The clear

implication is the dean will rule 1

against the candidates as a result of
the publicity. .
Rosenberg on the other hand is
suspicious"such publicity is delib-
erately aimed at affecting his
ultimate decision. He seems to
think the department is utilizing
the press for its own purposes.

The result is a department which
feels terrorized by their dean who
is in turn suspicious of the motives
of his faculty. Justified or not, the
English department crisis un-
doubtedly "serves as evidence of
this. -

Those caught in the middle of
this situation are the students.
Students cannot be educated at a
learning institution when such
distrust characterizes the relation-
ship among the faculty and
administrators. There is no reason
to think this attitude epitomizes
only the relationship between the
English department and the dean. .
This is not an atmosphere
conducive to learning, and learning
is the mission of the University.

Perhaps Vice-Chaiicellor of Stu-
dent Affairs Alfred Moye, best
summarized the general problem.
“We don't trust each other," he
said.

“We assume that no matter how
good the guy is, as soon as he gets
in the role of an administrator he is
going to start screwing you. As an
administrator you have people run
games on you so much that you
begin to get gun shy and you do not
put all your cards on the table for
fear that another game is going to
be run on you. '

“It's a silly system. You
wonder. These are all intelligent
people. Why are they behaving
this way? I can't imagine how any
student can sit back and look at us

and say they are models." And this V

is the way they behave?"

Yet. after significant publicity
the cases have not been resolved
and the importance of non-publicity
in the minds of those involved has
been further emphasized.

The University community has a
right to this information and this is
the one fact that everyone
concerned seems to have forgotten.

An inadequate and failing system
in the post-Watergate world
sympathizes with the elements of
secrecy by. refusing to disclose the
facts. The facts should be readily
available, and it is the respon-
sibility andithe obligation of the
press to obtain and report those
facts. I

The press, however, is admit-
tedly vulnerable to those who seek
to use it as a form of protest. But,
it is not a puppet press, since only
the press determines the material it
covers. If such incidents are
reported as factually as possible,
nobody has a legitimate complaint.

Even a campus press is not a
propagandist newsletter. The
interests of news lie in facts and not
sympathies, and ideally all those
who understand the basic role of a
free press in a democratic society
should assume those interests as
their personal interests.

The facts and the truth should
hurt no one. The day that news,
which reports the facts as well as
they can be gathered, negatively-
affects a decision by an admini-
strator is the day students should
pack their bags, never again willing
to return to an institution sup-
posedly dedicated to educating
students.

On that day higher education will
have as its only purpose the
participation by faculty and ad-
ministrators in political shell
ganies--a degenerative process
directly counter to the preservation
of the University as a learning
institution. .

Pitt's Pediatric Nurse-Practitioner
program will be only four years old
in September. but its graduates are
already revolutionizing child care
in Pittsburgh.

Functioning in an area tradition-
ally reserved for the pediatrician.

these new Pediatric Nurse-Practi-D

tioners (PNP's) can give physical
examinations, take medical histor-
ics. advise patients about first aid,
diet and exercise and even make
some diagnoses.

At first, PNP's were trained
merely‘ to assist pediatricians,
easing their tremendous workload.
The increased demand for pediatric
care has not been met by an
increase in the number of
pediatricians. however, and now
PNP's have assumed a more
expanded and independent role,
maintaining the high quality
medical care an overworked pedia-
trician may not deliver.

Pitt began training PNP's in
September 1970 as a way of coping
with the shortage of pediatricians.
Originally, the Pediatric Nurse-
Practitioner program was under the
joint supervision of the School of
Nursing and the School of
Medicine, but sine January 1974,
the program has been guided solely
by the School of Nursing.

Corinne Barnes. chairman of
Pitt's department of Pediatric

_Nursing, says the physician and
PNP now work together in a

needs. PNP’s provide a “Medical '

backup" for pediatricians facing a
workload that limits the amount of
attention they can give their young
patients.

“The pediatrician can see only so
many children a day, most of them
not very Ill, and may spend only a
few minutes advising each parent
about general health care and
development. PNP’s are able to
spend much more time with each
parent. thereby providing more
thorough care for every child, and
also releasing the doctor to devote
more time to children who are
seriously ill.

"The idea of a healthly child
never seeing _a doctor from birth
through adolescence is a concept
that‘s growing." says Barnes.

“The PNP's can handle the minor
illnesses and checkups for children
while providing mothers with good
health care advice."

Someone choosing to become a
PNP must be a qualiﬁed, regis-
tered nurse with at least two years
nursing experience before starting
the eight-month program at Pitt.
During training, the nurse learns
how to conduct a physical
examination, take medical histor-
ies, order and interpret laboratory
tests, and chart the physical and
emoti_onal development of children.
The nurse is taught how to counsel
parents about minor physical

Once trained. the nurse is
considered qualified to help in the
diagnosis and treatment of com-
mon, uncomplicated children's
ailments, although not allowed -to
start any treatment without the
physician's approval. Nurses
enrolled in Pitt's ‘PNP program are
trained at Allegheny General

cians‘ offices in the Pittsburgh
area.

The clinic is unusual in that its run

have‘ individual patient loads so
they provide regular. treatment .for

Through childhood, youngsters

when the clinic is closed, patients

PNP Jane. Dunkis.

People are indeed taking advan-
tage of the clinic's service.
Because the pediatric department
of the clinic has four PNP's in

best. .

The Atlanta Braves had a 49-44
record Tuesday morning but they
were fourth in the West Division, a
whopping 13 games behind the
runaway Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Philadelphia Phillies had a

O11 Strikeout Milestone

By PAUL LeBAR
APSports Writer
ST. LOUIS AP- One short his last
time out. the St. Louis Cardinal's

Bob Gibson strives again Wednes-‘

day night to become the second
pitcher to strike out 3.000 batters.
The 38-year-old Gibson. his total

at 2.999, was thwarted last Friday-

in a 7-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves.

But a hometown Busch Stadium
throng is expected to applaud him
past the target when the Cards take
on the Cincinnati Reds in the

  NFLPA Loses Ground

The Executive Committee of the
Management Council, headed by
John Thompson, held a “work
session” Tuesday, one of a series
of discussions it has conducted
since the strike began July 1.

“We're reassessing." said
Thompson. .
“The Players‘ Association

people have been meeting in
Washington all weekend." added
Thompson. “I would hope they're
doing the same thing we are ad that
they'd be ready to come to the table
in a day or two."

Bill Curry of the Houston Oilers
and the head of the NFLPA has
said it- _ is unlikely the veterans
would report ot camp en masse
before a settlement was reached.

  

Wednesday night National League
encounter.

A crowd of 47,944, the Cards’
largest in four seasons, watched
Gibson blaze a third strike_ past
Atlanta pitcher Roric Harrison for
his 2,998th strikeout last week.

Dusty Baker became another
victim an inning later, but the
Cards'- veteran later faltered in a
dramatic duel with home run king
Hank Aaron for No. 3.000.

The 40 year-old Aaron fell
behind 1-2 on the count. then
tapped meekly into a forceout inthe
eighth inning. as a pinch hitter.

Gibson, whose record is 5-9,
began the season with 2,928
strikeouts, second only to the 3,508
recorded by Walter Johnson in 21
major league seasons.

He struck out 49 in 96 innings
through June 19 and ﬁve days later
exploded with 11 while halting the
Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 for his 56th
career shutout.

Further preludes to the unsuc-
cessful assault last week included
three strikeouts June 30 against the
New York Mets and six a week later
at the expense of the Reds.

“I think I had as good of stuff as
I’ve had all year,” Gibson said
after subduing Cincinnati 3-1 on
July 6.

One ofthe free swinging Reds he
will face againiis catcher Johnny
Bench. whose second inning home

West. anyway-howabout the
Cincinnati Reds and Houston
Astros? The Reds’ record is 6‘/2
games better than the Phillies‘ and
the Astros’ are two games better.

That should come as no suprise,
since the Reds won the West last
year with a 9963 mark, only to drop

the playoffs to the New York Mets. '

who squeaked through to the
Eastern title with an 62-73 log. ‘The
Dodgers and San Francisco Giants
also had better records thatn the
Mets. '

“Well, all I can say is that we
can't do anything about it,” says
Manager Preston Gomez of the
Astros. ‘ “We’re in the West
Division andfwe have to win more
games than anybody ,in our
division. _ i

“The Dodgers have been playing
great ball and we've been playing
pretty good ball like Cincinnati and
Atlanta. If the Dodgers were in the
East Division it would be a runaway
there and our division would be
close. So I say you just have to
give credit to the Dodgers.”

“It's not logical to ask if we'd
like to be in the East." says Atlanta
Manager Eddie Mathews. “The
fact isithat we are in the West
Division. That may be illogical
geographically. but we asked to be‘
in that division and I don't
speculate on what it would be if‘ we
were someplace else."

Cincinnati’s Sparky Anderson is
surprised to see a repeat of last
year's treadmill in the East.

“I said last year I thought it
would even up. but the same
thing's happening again. I just
can't explain it. When the league‘
was divided, the same thing was
happening in the West. Then.
after a while, after 1930. it: shifted

until .500 seems to be the mean for

everybody in the East."

How about juggling some teams
around? After all. Atlanta and
Cincinnati are in the Eastern time
zone and the West Division while
St. Louis and Chicago are in the
Central time zone and the East
Division.

‘‘That’s up to the baseball

-people to decide,” says Gomez.

“All I know is that we are in the
West Division and all we can do is
play good baseball and beat the
Dodgers ourselves when we play
them.“ »

some (‘onoressnten say. to take
about two weeks. Senate Majority
Leatlcr Mike lmanslicld ll)-MT) has
pnnnised a speedy beginning for a
Sclnate trial. which could last one to
three months.

Naturally, when judging the
President. most members of the
House and Senate will be inter-
ested primarily in the evidence
provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.

The staff of that Committee
consisting of nearly 100 lawyers.
has focused their attention on
seven central areas. They are:
burglary at the Watergate. the
co\"cr-up. domestic surveillance.
the ITT ease. the dairy industry
fund. the Hughes donation. and the
Vesco contribution.

However. it is likely the strength
article of impeachment

greatly on the %sident‘s involve-

‘ menu in the break-in and cover—up.

p‘Some Democrats, according to
recent newspaper articles, have

"  what might be three

strong ankles of impeachment.
till [late deal broadly with the
authority
especial} as the authority relates
to the Walugate alfair.

Aﬂtllnough the Jludiciary *Com- A

nnuttcd ciiinctuoed that an impeach-
ablc offense need not be a criminal
offense on the part of the
President. many legislators. par-
ticularly conservative Republicans.
are searching beyond the circum-
stantial cvidcncc already accumu-
lated against the President. for
morc direct. serious involvement.

One Nixon statement likely to
receive attention by those looking
for concrete evidence of the
President's guilt. was released by
the Judiciary Committee last week

in ~i.l.i3 pages of evidence
concerning the Watergate break-in
and cover-up. Reportedly kept on
the tape by the White House
accitlcntally. the quote came from
the President only one day after he
said he learned of the Watergate
coverup and began his own
investigation.

In the White House conversa-
tion, he told John Mitchell. later
accused in the Watergate indict-
ment, “I want you all to stonewall
it, let them plead the ﬁfth
amendment. cover-up or anything
else. if it'll save it--save the plan.“

In addition to the evidence
accumulated by the Judiciary
Committee. other factors promise
to play a key role in the voting
behavior of members of the House
and then the Senate.

‘k Within a week or two. the
Supreme Court will rule whether
Nixon must release 64 tape
recordings of White House conver-
sations to Special Prosecutor Leon
Javvorski. lfthc President loses the
case. it will naturally be a major
setback. whether or not he chooses
to comply with the decision.

If the President complies. it is
conceivable some new evidence

more damaging than that he has '

already released could surface,
providing the committee obtains
access to the 64 tapes.

lfthc President does not comply.
however. it would serve as another
indication of his obstruction. at
least in the minds of many
American citizens and Congress-
men. and further increase the
suspicions of those who ultimately
can impeach and convict the
President. "

Even if the Court decides in favor
of the President. and does not hold
that the Special Prosecutor has

' right of access to the tapes. the

Committee can. and it is likely it
will. under the Constitution. hold
the President for contempt and

draft his refusal into an article of
impcaclnncnt.

‘k Another factor which will play
heavily is the upcoming trial of the
co-defendants in the Watergate
(‘t)llSplI‘tlL‘_\ trial. Seven of the
President‘s top aides have been
charged. with Charles Colson
already tried after pleading guilty
to a relatively minor charge.

John Mitchell. H. R. Haldcman.
John Ehrlichman. Gordon Strachan
Robert Mardian. and Kenneth
Parkinson will be names heard
regularly throughout the early fall
as a result of the trail. This fact
cannot promise beneﬁts for a
White House public relations effort
to improve its itnage.

wk Another important factor in
the impeachment proceedings is
the November elections. when all
435 congressmen and one third of
the members of the Senate are up
for reelection. It is not difficult to
remember the early spring of this
year when several “safe" Repub-
lican seats. including Vice Presi-
dent Gerald Ford's old seat in
Michigan. were lost to Democrats
in special elections.

It is election time when
legislators traditionally receive the
most input from back home--in
their congressional districts.
During the campaign months--for
House members it could be during
a debate on‘ articles of impeach-
ment--constiluents reactions and

attitudes could mold the future of
President Nixon's existing political
career.

Some (‘tm_gresstncn. such as
Republican H. .lohn Heinz [ll of
Pctmsylvania. polled their con-
stituents early to determine their
feelings on Watergate and im-
pcachmcnt.

ln questionnaires sent to his
constituents after the firing of
Archibald Cox as special prosc-

cutur of which 70.000 were
returned. Heinz. learned many
would favor the impeachment

process if the President did not
obey a court order to release White
House tape rccording,s.

In another polling conducted last
April which had 28,000 responses,

iiConcern Of Congress : impeachment FClClOl‘S

29"?» favored impeachment, 28%
were against it. and 30% told
Congressman Heinz to exercise his
own judgment on the issue.

Watergate is going down the
stretch. Like an old racchorse. it
has had its slow and uneasy
moments. It is now in a slow
moment. But the immediate future
promises to quicken events. and
lwiiig a speedy end to an affair
which has dominated headlines for
over two years.

One thing is almost certain.
r‘\ccortlin_g to many congressional
aides. the House is almost sure to
impeach and bring at trial to the
Senate. Only one year ago this
might have been an almost
unbearable challenge to most
politicos.

At McKeesport Hospital she heads
a tightly knit organization of PNP‘s
who “really care."

“Our ideal is to give each patient
at least 30 minutes of time per visit,
so we can deal with her concerns in
a very personal way,“ says Dr.
Welton. “lt’s better than the

 

average physician can provide with no

"instead of seeing us as an
authoritarian figure who only has

adds PNP Semler. “a mother can
