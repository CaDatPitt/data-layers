nization’s main responsibility.

“Hurricanes and ﬂooding from hur-
ricanes is our bread and butter,” said Sar-
ubbi.

FEMA provides response and relief
to disaster areas. According to Sarubbi, it

i takes a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get

the relief to the areas that need it.

FEMA is not a ﬁrst-response organi-
zation but provides support to the ﬁrst-
responders.

When a disaster occurs it is local emer— '

gency personnel, such as ﬁreﬁghters, med-
ics and police who arrive on the scene
and take control of the situation. FEMA
meanwhile assesses thedamages to people
and property.

When the damages reach a speciﬁc
dollar amount, they send a report to the
president to recommend a declaration of
emergency.

“We cannot provide any federal support
until the president declares it a national di-
saster,” said Sarubbi.

“It sounds like a long, bureaucratic pro-
cess, and it is,” he admitted. “We saw it in
Katrina.”

'iSarubbi said that FEMA’s emergency
response program has greatly improved

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

since then. Now when a severe hurricane
develops, FEMA can do a pre—disaster
analysis of the damages it might cause and

send the report to the president to declare ,

the emergency ahead of time.

Because of this new and improved sys-
tem, Sarubbi said that local communities
have been trained to more effectively han-
dle evacuations, food distribution, medi-
cal care and emergency ‘shelters ahead of
time.

“If you look back at Katrina, a lot of
things didn’t wor ,” said Sarubbi. “Now we
have a better sense of what needs are -and
respond more quickly and effectively.”

Tracy Hehmeyer, a preparedness analy-
sis and planning ofﬁcer for Region III,
said that Pitt can play a key role in plan-
ning ahead for emergencies. She warned
that they should not wait for the federal
government to arrive immediately on the
scene.

“Students should make an emergen-
cy plan ahead of time,” ,she said. “They
should know an evacuation route and have
food and bottled water to last three days in
case of an emergency.”

She added that Pitt as a ‘campus can
train individuals to be able to assist others
in an emergency situation and help with
the response and relief from the federal
government when it is able to reach a di-
saster area.

Onisex-ed., Pittsburgh  

schools doin' it right

It’s really no secret at all that
teens are having sex. This isn’t
the 1950s. But no matter whom
you want to blame -—— or embrace
— for this behavioral change, it’s
importantjhat teens have an ac-
curate, informative and approach-

I able source of sexual education.

At the end of February, the
Pittsburgh school board rescind-
ed the district’s abstinence—only
sex—education curriculum. The
decision was made after board
members voted 8-1 to change

i the policy. .

It’s about time the Pittsburgh
school board withdrew its absti-
nence-only model of teaching.
The Centers for Disease Control
said one in four teen girls carries
a sexually transmitted infection.
Clearly it’s wishful thinking to
imagine that there isn’t a sizeable
number of sexually active teens.

And let’s be honest, in our
culture, college life is synony-
mous with sexual activity. To be
prepared for these encounters,
incoming college students should
receive adequate sex education
during their school years prior to
college. Anything less deprives
students from vital health knowl-
edge they might otherwise not
obtain. After all, not all parents
are comfortable discussing this
subject with their children, and
some kids won’t listen anyway.

Peers and the media offer a poor 0

substitute.
Pitt’s Student Health Service
said it “supports and participates

in accurate sexual health infor- I
mation that would allow students 
to make informed decisions. We 0
would hope that all students .

coming to Pitt have had access

to credible and informative sexu- '

al health information, but would

offer no comment on another’s 

program.”

editorial board i 

, The editorial board of The Pitt News made a mistake in writing the ,
editorial “PPC should overhaul its executive’s privileges” last Tuesday.

The board concluded that the Pitt Program Council’s executive

‘ board director is entrusted with too much power and his position i

should be redeﬁned. The conclusion was based on facts that we re-
ported incorrectly in the story “PPC director calls all shots.”

We were wrong. The executive board director doesn’t have un— 
checked ﬁnal authority, and administrators like program council adviser I

' Tom Misuraca, Director of Student Life Kenyon Bonner and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey hold ultimate power over the council’s deci- 3

sions.

Conservatives named Michael
Steele the new chairman of the Re-
publican National Committee. At
the Conservative Political Action

audience, “Tonight, we tell America,
‘We know we did wrong. My bad?”
This is part of a masterstroke plan
to combine GOP values with what
Steele calls “urban—suburban hip-
hop settings.” Drop it like it’s hot, I.i’l
Steeley.

Like rappers, Steele discovered

_ that words matter more than behav-
_ ior. Carefully chosen slang —— espe-
j cially once it becomes a cultural cli-

che——canmaskany flaw, andquitky
catchphrases can defang even the
most heinous acts, or at least reduce
complex debates into simple punch-
lines. With this strategy, Steele has the
opportunity to charm away all the
Republican Partgfs alleged mistakes
In hopes of restoring the Grand
to the Old Party, here are some sug-

gestions for what Republicans need?

‘to rehabilitate:
Vtndictively revealing the identity

‘ of an undercover CIA agent because
 her husband dared criticize the Re-

publican president? “Busted.”

Commuting the punishment of
the felon involved in the exposure?
“Oops”

Appointing a horse judge to run‘

FEMA, resulting in hundreds of
deaths and thousands of people sur-
viving  squalor duting Hurricane
Katrina? “Do over.”

i  record surpluses and
creating record deﬁcits to beneﬁt the
richest people on Earth? “Who’s the
goose? This guy.”

Pleecing the American public into
a false war slaying more than 4,000
US. soldiers and 100,000 Iraqis?
“Whoopsy daisy—cutter bomb.”

A Attempting to gamble, and whol-
ly lose, Americans’ retirement money
in a failing stock market? “Whatchu
talkin ’bout, Willis?”

Furtively  constitutional
liberties from citizens and openly
tortuiing foreign suspects? “Mama
mea culpa.” _

Obviously, these responses don’t
have that “urban” ﬂair Steele wants,
but quit drinking that ‘Haterade
Steele must give white people — i.e.
every Republican leader aside from
himself and Louisiana Gov Bobby
Jindal — time to catch up.

Radio host Chris Sliwa inter-

viewed Steele, asking  if he

I'M NOT
ASKING FOR A
KAISE... JUST SOME
t<tND or STtMULUS
PACKAGE.’

   
 

 
   
   

 

Cl’ Campus

would give jindal some “slum love”
after Sliwa claimed people look at
Jindal and say, “Oh, that’s the ‘Slum-
dog Millionaire’ governor?” This
might sound racist, but it’s not Steele
is black, and his response of laugh-
ter and, “I love it,” validated Sliwa’s

— otherwise wanton stereotype It ain’t

trickin’ if ya got it
In the same program, Steele said,

_ “Bobbyjindal is doing a friggin’ awe-

some job in his state." Steele’s slang
could transform Republican rhetoiic.
“Heckuva job, Brownie,” is the past.
“P1:iggin’ awesome job, Bobby,” is
the future

That’s why, in the actual words of
Rep. Michelle Bachmann, R—Minn.,
,“l\/lichael Steele, you be the man.”
Don’t confuse “the man” with The
Man, represented by big government
Spendocrats. Their Establishment
glosses over the cost of welfare pro-
grams and nanny policies. In omer
words, they ride clean, but their gas

Steele’s introduction of slang, re-
gardless of the culture from which it

‘ comes, represents the next evolution

in politics. “My bad” is a step above
the previous conservative theme —

Alberto Gonzales says there’s no

tion. “It’s wasn’t me.”

Halliburton’s proﬁteering ﬁom
war and the military-industrial com-
plex. “It wasn’t me.”

Gay people stripped of civil liber-
ties, Santorum thinks bestialitys next
“It wasn’t me.”

Wait Conservatives remain proud
of that last one, but “street terminol-
ogy,” as Steele calls it, can dress it up.

Make discrimination cool Hip-
hop outpaces Steele in this regard,
as a popular rap catchphrase, “No
homo,” already exploits lingering ho-
mophobia in the community.

“No homo” is a marketing boon
for Steele. Usually he’s more Kris
Kross than Public Enemy, but whip-
ping up fear of a gay planet could
help conservatives amend the Con-
stitution for strictly traditional mar-
riage.

Applying urban idioms to GOP

values creates inﬁnite opportuni-
ties to court the next generation of
voters. A freestyle battle between
Mitt Romney and Rush Limbaugh
would make more money than a Ty-

stronger than Chris Brown. The
battle to be  of Rep(ublicans),
however, looked like it might take
place.between Rush and Steele

Last weekend, Steele admitted
that Rush is just an “entertainer,” and
his comments can be “incendiary”

and “ugly.” Stop snitchin’. Monday

morning, Rush spoke to his 20—rnil— .

lion-deep posse of listeners. Every
day he’s hustlin’. He burned Steele,
likening him to Nancy Pelosi, and
said, “Michael Steele, you are head of
the RNC. You are not head of the
Republican Party  The next Repub-
lican president is going to be the head
of the party. Last time I checked, Mr:
Steele isn’t rumiing.”

Get at me, dog. Generations ago,
nobody could have predicted Repub-

licans would make such tremendous
social progress that they could one
day attack their ﬁrst black ﬁgurehead.
Steele had the opportunity to lead
conservatives in a new direction, out
from under Rush’s repressive, bovine

shadow. Like Nas and_]ay-Z, though, i
the two made amends Steele apolo— —

To the Editor;

I am  response to Erik Hinton’s column, “Print comics the opposite of comic” I’m not sure what got into Hinton’s craw about print
comics, butto say that these comics are  “awﬁil” is just sirnple-minded. P’ L g .

Hinton should note that most newspapers are not aimed at tndays young people, but rather at the older gmerations who grew up with these
comics. Despite what some people mightthink,the world doesn’t revolve around our generation. . r

I laugh at the notion of this comic “contributing  stimulating” to the papa: The decent comics, “Kingjember” and “Slice of Life” are

American Indian dance colors B

by Larissa Gula .
Staff IV/'[ter

LAKOTA SIOUX INDIAN DANCE
THEATRE
Sunday, 3 p.m.
Byham Theater, Downtown
412-456-6666

Retaliating against current societal
turmoil, the traditional dances of the
Lakota Sioux aim to bring the tribal
message of  and balance to
Pittsburgh. ’ ‘ 

Cokata Upol, translated as “Come
to the Center,” is being performed
by the Lakota Sioux Dance Theater,
which has thrived since 1978 on the
support of Lakota American Indian
community leaders, educators, pow-
wow dancers,  and storytellers
who’ve passed down the culture of
the people.

In line with its goal to keep the
message of the oiiginal culture alive,
Cokata Upo! is a showcase of Lakota
culture through traditional dance

“The dances are authentic — the
dancers are all champion powwow
dancers,” said director Henry Smith.
Smith is one of the founders of the
30-year-old Lakota Dance Theatre
Project;

The media for Cokata Upo! are
quite varied. According to Smith, the
show uses storytelling, dance, ritual,
video imagery and video projections
to tell the.stories of the Lakota and
Dakota tribes, and each section of

‘A

Cou Kohler Arts Center

member of the ‘Lakota Sioux Dance ‘Theatre reminds an audience

that it's polite to keep quiet  the performance.

 

the show is interspersed with various
dances. ‘

“Some dances are story dances.
Others are vision dances. There are
different categories, like fancy dance,
traditional men and women’s, jingle
dance and fancy women shawl danc-
es. There are a lot of different plains
[American] Indian dances in the
piece,” said Smith.

In addition to knowing their steps
in multiple stylized dances, the danc-
ers each own their outﬁts — and it

. was made quite clear that they are not

to be confused as anything except
outﬁts. I

“They aren’t wearing costumes
— they’re outfits,” said Smith. “Each
one is a design of the family. The col-
ors would be speciﬁc to the dancer,
and the pattern would be speciﬁc to
the dancer and their family.”

For example, “Eagle feathers
might show that he was a veteran and
had been to war. They are symbolic
of that dancefs history,” said Smith.

The choreography of each dance
varies from powerful stomps and
marches to intticate movements of
the feet and body. The 11: dancers
also repeatedly focus on  a

circular pattern, which represents a

sacred symbol in the Lakota culture
as well as the highly regarded balance
of life. ' A '1 

“The balance with nature involves
unity with animal spirits,” said Smith.
“That’s a concept of balance between

nature. The outﬁts represent that ——

. there are all kinds of animal dances,

like horse and buffalo. There’s an
eagle dance. That’s the connection
demonstrated between people and
nature.”

The stage promises to contribute
to this overall balance between the
people and their surroundings, as
well.

“It’s a full show with  ef-
fects and fogs,” said Smith. “We don’t
have a lot of props. It really tells the
story through the drums, narrative,
dances, and the ﬂutes and the way
they’re juxtaposed. It’s the way we
build the effects of the dances.”

Cokata Upo! is composed of
three parts, each with a storyline
that pretty much mirrors the classic
Charles Dickens tale, “A Christmas
Carol” — with the Christmas theme
replaced and updated, of course. .

“Birth of a Nation” contains the
focus of the Lakota’s creation stories.
“Death and Rebirth” depicts the tur-
moil of the Lakota’s present move-
ment and lifestyle And “All Nations
Are One” is the hope for a united
ﬁiture among the Lakota.

“It’s going to talk about the birth
of a nation,” said Smith. “How the
lands broke apart, how the different
tribes came together to form the na-
tion and the eagle ﬂag with the seven
feathers and what it represents. Part
of the goal in performance is to keep
this alive.”

‘Watchmen’ a Winner

WATCHMEN

Directed by Zack Snyder
Starring: Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey
Dean Morgan, Billy Crudup
Warner Bros.
‘k

Let’s say you
spend‘ the entire
football season
waiting for the

Super Bowl, but
when it arrives, you aren’t familiar
with either of the teams playing."

You watch it anyway, because
you like football,,but the game just
doesn’t engage you. _You don’t rec-
ognize anyone. You don’t get the
references to earlier in the season.

 

You might even get ‘a little bored.
Every time the fans around you
get excited over something seem-
ingly insigniﬁcant, you can’t fig-
ure out why, and when it’s over

e and they’re all hotly debating the

game’s missteps and triumphs,
you can’t help feeling "a little left
out.

’ If you’re familiar with “Watch-
men,” Alan Moore’s cerebral de-
construction of superheroes that
revolutionized a genre and lent
new credibility to an entire_medi—.

um, your loins have likely quivered '

with anticipation of Zack Snyder’s
film adaptation for months.

If such is the case, get thee to ‘a
theater — this is the “Watchmen”
you’ve been waiting for. If you’ve

never read Moore’s magnum opus,
you might not be so lucky.

Snyder deﬁes the rules of ad- '
aptation, ignoring the why and’

how of the artistic license neces-
sary to successfully capture the es-
sence of a story in one medium
and present it  another. Instead
he replicates, he worships, he slav-
ishly adheres to the source mate-
rial in a way that pleases the indoc-

‘trinated and alienates the casual

consumer. V ,

Huskies top draw in tourney

Women's basketball, page 15

11 West Virginia or No. i 14 Provi-
dence. In the regular season, Pitt beat
West Virginia both times, but lost to
both DePaul and Providence

Prior to the tournament, Pitt se-
nior Shavonte Zellous was named to
the All—Big East ﬁrst team for the third
year in a row She was accompanied by
senior Xenia Stewart on the second
team and Shawnice “Pepper ’ Wilson
on the All-Freshmen tearn

While an automatic jump to the
quarterﬁnals sounds good, it is in no
waygoingtobeaneasyroadto the
championship. \V1th teams like Con-
necticut (30—0, 16-0) and Louisville
(27—3, 14-2)  for the title, it’s 
to be a long tiip for the Panthers

Connecticut’s perfect record
earned it the No. 1 seed in addition
to winning the regular season crown.
The Huskies will cleaiiy be the biggest
obstacle for Pitt and any other team
that plays them in the tournament

Connecticut brings along an out-
standing senior guard in Renee Mont-
gomery, who was recentiy awarded the
Frances Pomeroy Naisrnith Award
and this season’s Big East Sportsman-
ship Award Montgomery averaged

16.6 points per game this season and
has scored in double ﬁgures in 16
straight contests

Connecticut also has a tough
sophomore forward in Maya Moore,
who averages 18.9 points and 9.1 re-
bounds per game

The Panthers lost a tough 95-42
contest against Connecticut in Storrs,
on Feb. 15, but the tournament is
hosted at the XL Center in Hartford.
While it hopes to give the Huskies a
good run, Pitt remains realistic

“I don’t believe that Connecticut

is  to get upset in the Big East,” -

said Berenato. “But we’re  to 
them everything we have.”

Shortly after its loss to Connecti-
cut, Pitt beat Villanova in a game that
allowed the Panthers to overtake the
Wﬂdcats in the standings and put
them in third place

Pitt’s only loss since then came
at the hands of the Big East tourna-
ment’s No. 2 seed, Louisville

The No. 7 Cardinals have only lost
two conference games this season,
one to Connecticut and the other to
an unranked West Virginia. Look for
an intense matchup between their

star player and all-time leading scorer,
Angel McCoughtry, who averages
23.4 points per game, and Pitt’s Zel-
lous, who is averaging 22.6 points per
game

If Pitt wins its first game, it could
face Louisville in the semiﬁnals, and
the Panthers would only see Connect-
icut in Tuesday’s ﬁnals,  wins
in its ﬁrst and second games

Though tough games loom, Be-
renatoandherteamarefocusedon
themselves, not on probable oppo-
nents.

“I don’t care who we play, we like
our bracket,” said Berenato. “Often
times in the season you’re so worried
about the other teams that you forget
about your own place. I’m very con-
scious that we don’t want to wear our
kids down. What we have to do is fo-
cus on us.” '

In the 2008 tournament, the Pan-
thers beat Vlllanova and upset No.4-
seeded Notte Dame before losing to
eventual champion Connecticut in the
semiﬁnals 74-47. \

Pitt’s ﬁrst game in the quarterﬁnals
takes place Sunday at 8 pm, and can
be seen on ESPNU.

r Student Travel alert for Mexico at ,-

Excerpts from the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs website:

i hitpzl/traveLstate.2ov/travel/cis,pa_tw/ca/t>a_,3028.himlit

This information is current as of Monday, Mar 02. 2009 10:17:27 GMT-0500 (E87).

This Tra vet Alert (February 20, 2009) updates securityinformatron for U. S. citizenslraveling and living in Mexico.
It supersedes the Travel Alert for Mexico dated October 15.‘2008, and expires on August 20. 2009.

While millions oi U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year (including thousands who cross the iand border every
day for study, tourism or business), violence in the country has increased recently. it is imperative that travelers
understand the risks oi travel to Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and whom to contact if one be
comes a crime victim. Common-sense precautions such as visiting onlylegitimato business and tourist areas dur-
ing daylight hours. and avoiding areas where prostitution and drug dealing might occur, can help ensure that travel
-to Mexico-is safe and enioyable. -

- 0.8. citizens who believe they are being targeted for kidnapping or other crimes should notify Merrioan officials and the nearest
American consulate or the Embassy assoon as possible, and should consider returning to'the United States.

~ US. citizens should make every attempt to travel on main roads during daylight hours. particularly the toll ("cools") roads,
which generally are more secure. , . ~ , '

» U.S. citizen visitors are encouraged to stay in the‘well-known tourist areas of the cities. Travelers should leave their itinerary
nglth a friend or family member not traveling with them, avoid traveling alone, and should check with their cellular provider prior
to departure to confirm that their cell phone is capable of roaming on GSM or (36 international networks. Do not disptay expen-

sive-Iooicing jewelry, large amounts oi money, or other valuable items.

- US. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locauons during
late night and early morning hours, and remalnalert to news reports. . - - w ‘

~ US. citizens arerurged to be alert to safety and security concerns when visiting the border region.

- U.S. citizen victims of crime in Mexico are urged to contact the consular section of the nearest U.S. consulate or embassy lore
advice and assistance. Contact information is provided at the end of this message. - '

’ - During demonstrations or law enforcement operations, U.S. citizens are advised to remain in their homes or hotels. avoid large
crowds, and avoid the downtown "and suhouiiding areas. ' Since the timing and routes of scheduled marches and demonstra-
tions are always subiect to change, U.S. citizens should monitor locat media sources tor new developments and exercise ex»
treme caution while within the vicinity of protests. The Mexican Constitution prohibits political activities ‘by foreigners, and such
actions may result in detention and/or deportation. U.S. citizens are therefore advised to avoid participating in demonstrations
or other activities that might be deemed political by Mexican authorities. As is always the case in any large gathering. U.S. 
zens should remain alert to their surroundings. ‘ . ' _

. ’ To see the entire travel alert, and for detailed ‘information for staying sale in

Mexico as well as consulates and consular agencies please go to the following website: '
