BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Members of Delta Phi Epsilon
sorority whose suite in Amos Hall
was gutted by ﬁre April 17 will
receive a low interest- loan from the
sorority’s national affiliate.

The sorority owned the furniture, *

drapes, carpeting and lamps in the
chapter room, hall and entryway of

the suite but did not have insurance _

on the items, according to area
coordinator Ursula Kingsley.

the national sorority, said the Pitt
chapter has not submitted an
estimate of its losses yet but will
receive the loan when those ﬁgures
are obtained. \

Spero said the suite will be
completely refurnished and, ac-
cording to Housing Director Don
Hughes. will be ready for occu-
pancy by September when sorority
‘members return.

The ﬁre broke out shortly after '8
a.m. on Saturday, April 17, in the
chapter room of the third ﬂoor

,$_suite. The ﬁre was conﬁned to the

suite, although the entire ﬂoor was
damaged extensively by smoke and
water.

Though the exact cause of the
ﬁre was not determined, it was an
“occupant caused ﬁre” not ignited
by shorts in the electrical system,
according to Physical Plant Direc-
tor Hunt Vl. Martin, Jr.

University's loss in ' the ﬁre,

Speciﬁc data on the ‘University

chart balancing tuition increases,
compensation increases and pro-
gram cutbacks, was presented last
month to the Senate Budget
Policies Committee.

The chart outlined the options

~for tuition were given by Vice

Chancellor of Planning and Budget
Jack Freeman.

Freeman said it was still too,

early to tell how extensive the hike
might be. But he estimated it may
fall within the ﬁve percent range.
The trend at other universities
has been an eight percent hike, he
pointed out, but that does not
necessarily mean Pitt must follow

Faces Trusteescruﬁnyi

BY CONNIE GIEL

The‘ Board of Trustees will vote
May 18 to endorse or reject a
mandatory student health fee.

The fee, considered the only
workable funding base left the
Student Health Service, is $16 per
term for all full-time graduate and
undergraduate students. _

If endorsed, students would be
assessed the fee, probably as an
invoice item, in the coming ._fall
term. Spring and summer session
students would pay $8 ‘each
‘session, beginning in the 1977
spring term. ‘

The current

student health

~ budget runs out June 30, the end of

_the ﬁscal year. “But‘we’ll have a
line of credit to draw upon by

then,” said Gary Houston, execu-

tive assistant to the vice chancellor
for Student Affairs.

Houston said the.Health Service‘

will continue to operate through
September, technically without a
budget. If ‘the Trustees endorse
the funding proposal, the fee could
be implemented in the fall term at
the earliest.

Student Affairs ofﬁcials will
present the funding proposal to a
Board of Trustees committee May
18, before the ‘full Board meeting.

Sex‘Bias Case Adjourned S

BY non PEBLEGRINI

The suit charging the University
with sex discrimination, ﬁled in
1973 by Dr. Sharon Johnson,
assistant professor in the School of
Medicine. after she was denied
tenure, adjourned from the court

room after eleven weeks of
hearings.
For the past three weeks,

Johnson’s attorney Sylvia Roberts,
aired the plaintiff's case before
Federal Court "Justice William
Knox in_Courtroom Six in Federal
Court. The University will present
its case when the hearing resumes
in August.

Johnson was denied tenure in
October. i971, and after taking the
case through various University
bodies. she ﬁled suit charging the
University with violation of the
Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1966
and of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.

Her suit asks for her reinstate-
ment as a full professor, with
tenure, back pay to June 1971 and
$1.5 million damages to her
professional standing, reputation
and research.

In May. 1973, Johnson won an
injunction—-the ﬁrst injunction
ever made against an institution of
higher learning in a sex discrim-
ination cases involving profession-
al, rather than blue-collar jobs. A

. L Assistant to the Chancellor-Dave

Powers stated the_,University _had

-. u

offered twice to settle out of court..
When asked about the proposed
out, of courtsettlement, Johnson
refused to comment. A

Powers also said that, while the

’ University feels that it has a good

chance of winning the suit, it
almost would certainly appeal if the
suit went against them.

Law School Fomially Opened  it 

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Supreme Court Associate Justice
Byron R. White was the principal
speaker at a ceremony Saturday
morning in David _Lawrence Hall
concluding a two-day dedication
program of Pitt's new $8.5 million
Law School Building.

White told an audience of over
1,000 invited guests, including
University and government ofﬁ-
cials. law school deans and Pitt
alumni. he doesn't think the tight

job market for law school
graduates will diminish the need
for expanded law school facilities.

‘.‘Things are not that dark,"
White said. “The place of ‘the law

'.in,our society is going to grow." .'
Vi He_cited Supreme Court decisions

"... - 
.i- .. ~

~ ..A

The main issue in the. case is
whether sex discrimination by the
University had anything to do with
denying Johnson tenure, » or
whether the decision stemmed
solely from a consideration of her
teaching ability and the relevance
of her research, as the University
contends.

requiring states to furnish-counsel
for indigent defendents and the-
Legal Services Corporation, which
is responsible for providing service
to meet the needs of the poor, as
examples of where more lawyers
are needed.

“Legal . Services Corporation
doesn't help lower and middle
income people who can support
themselves. These people" often
cannot afford legal services they
need." White said law schools
should be thinking about satisfying
these needs. .

Sell. who acted as master "of

gram. said the class,and seminar

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

The Big Bad Wolf

Universities like to be thought of as the epitornes of fairness, the
bearers of enlightent'nent——a respected part of the community. To
' some members of the Oakland community, however, the University of
Pittsburgh has become a Big Bad Wolf devouring street after street of
the urban countryside. When local residents express their resentment
toward the Pit expansion into their neighborhoods,‘ the University
huffs and puffs with all its might to silence the village fools. While
many colleges strive for an Ivory'Tower image, Pitt is a besieged castle
struggling to keep the peasants from breaking down the main gate.
The University administration must realize its responsibility to the
Oakland community and the City of Pittsburgh to be a good neighbor
and play an important and constructive part in community affairs.
The University should realize that many of the decisions made in the
chancellor’s ofﬁce affect the surrounding area as well. When the
University underwent an expansion program in the mid-sixties,
causing a large increase in the number of students enrolled at Pitt, the
demand for Oakland apartments dramatically increased—-and so did

- the rents for those apartments. These inﬂated rents must be paid by

people who make their homes in Oakland, as well as the Pitt students

- who live here only part of the year.

The University also has developed the image of being a slum
landlondthat is totally unsuitable for an institution of higher learning.
-.The school owns and rents out many buildings in the residential areas
of Oakland which are not maintained as well as they should be. Many
of these building's occupants have ﬁled complaints with publichealth

I '  . departments and the ﬁre department for violation of the city's building
codes

i~ I whether they like it or not, Pitt’s administration shouldjrealize it is

A part of the Pittsburgh community: the two are tied together. What

people think about Pittsburgh is going to affect Pitt, and to slight the

city by being an irresponsible landlord and neighbor will, in the end,

‘hurt the University. To own a spanking new law building and a
dilapidated apartment house within a few blocks of each other does not

make sense.

Clearly, it is time for Pitt to take off its wolf mask, open the castle

    

The Pitt Hedge?

Frisbee Follies. Fantasy Excur-
sions, T.M. at am and pm, yoga
and yogurt, sex anytime, and the
Pitt Hedge all have something in
common. That is, they relax the
strained mind and bring some
solitude to the soul and body. And
from the psychic feeling transmit-
ted through your ﬁngers to these

. pages, ,1. sense you wondering,

“The Pitt Hedge?"

‘To explain. let me call upon your
earnest imagination for practical
and aesthetic purposes. Got it?
Then hold on and imagine you're
on the wide open, lush green

- Cathedral lawn, in visual quietude.

That is. imagine the absence of

the ubiquitious Oakland automo-
biles. Imagine the overbearing
bursts of Burger Chef color decor
disappearing from the roadways.

Imagine blatant bus billboards
turning a cool green. Imagine the
mind minus Matadors, Mavericks,

_ Mustangs. Mercurys, and Mazdas.

Imagine doubling the present

these imaginations turn to realities.

Deterioration

As individuals interested in the
women's basketball program at
Pitt, we would like to comment on
the past season. We are three of
the many people skeptical about
the basketball team's progress this
season. We pose the following
questions for consideration:

Why were Jean Condo and Jan
Kasnevich, the two outstanding
Western Pennsylvania coaches,
really tired? Indeed, why did Mary
Kromer, the women's volleyball

coach, quit at the end of a
successful season? Why did ﬁve
talented women basketball players
quit during the season? Rumor has
it that all-American candidate
Debbie Jones is considering
transfering. Is this true and if so
why? Could Pitt really afford to lost
an athlete of this caliber? There is
also speculation that four addition-
al basketball team members are

considering leaving the University. _

Why did a team with so much
talent and so many scholarship
players do so poorly at regionals
and have a mediocre season
record?

The University advertised for a
new head women's varsity basket-
ball coach and two assistants. Why
have the applicants not been
notified of their status? How. long
can Pitt afford to wait to name a
permanent coaching staff? Why are
many of the local high school
basketball talents not considering
Pitt as a place to play theircollege

“ . ,Dreaming of Fruit  i

BY BILL MOORE

Lettuce. Celery. Carrots. Onions.
Tomatoes. Potatoes. Radishes.
Strawberries. Bananas. Pineapple.

I dreamt about fruits and
vegetables last night. It was a
nightmare.

I dreamt that nobody showed up
today to order food from the
Student Government (SG) Co-op...
It was a nightmare because the
Co-op, an idea ‘proposed. by SG
President Barry Weisband in the
election last.January, is just the
sort offhing I’ve been saying the
SG Board should do for students.

It was just about the only thing
setting Weisband off from the
other candidates, and just about

  ACase for Good

BY GEORGE W. DULL

During the winter term three
situations evolved at Pitt, each of
which elicited comment and argu-
ment from the University commun-
ity at large.

One, the move by the professors
towards unionization.

Two, the increase in tuition made

necessary by budget restrictions

imposed by the Commonwealth
Legislature.

Three, the refusal of the
sociology department to renew the
teaching contract of Dr. Paul
Nyden. a contract that would have
brought him to the tenure point in
his career. .

The whole fabric of the above,’
when considered in its historical
context. could be interpreted as
reaction to the liberalism encour-
aged by the campus protest years
and the civil rights movement of
the '60s and early '70s. These
never became manifest at Pitt in
the same sense they did at the

University of California at Berkel- ’

ey. Columbia University. Kent
State and the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. Some

people credit the trimester format
for Pitt's comparative quiet during
the refractory period. It no doubt
helped. but the University of
Pittsburgh lacks the ‘environment
to produce radical leaders because
it is a mirror reflection of the
community as it should-be. This is

’ not necessarily the healthy situa-

If it fails, it will prove either that
students will refuse to cooperate
with the Board no matter what they
do, or that students don’t like fruits
and vegetables. Either way, I will
be »eating my words instead of

‘lettuce at 35 cents per head.

Which is why I plan to blow this
week's paycheck at the Co-op. It is
an idea long overdue, and
something which could be expand-
ed to include much more than
produce.

If Daniel

Bell, professor of

‘sociology at Harvard, is to be

believed, Harvard College, in
1913-1915, had a- group of
dissenting students called the
“Young Intellectuals” and from it
came noted Americans
whom were Walter Lippman, Van
Wy_ck Brooks, John Reed and
Harold Stearrs. Many regarded
these as radicals and perhaps they
were. Under the influence ‘of
philosopher. George Santayana,
who by then had returned to his
native Spain, they effectively wrote
the obituary for Puritanism in
America. s

Pitt has a group of dissenting
students engaged on campus and
at «times it becomes a mildly
disruptive element. At this point in
their scholastic careers these
students have the same potential as
had the Harvard group. These are
students who. romantically. choose
to say “this is what we are” and
they then pursue the trappings of
radicalism as it exists only in their
minds and imaginations. At times
they are amusing. The earnestness
with which they argue their case is
moving. But so is castor oil. There
are other occasions when they
become somewhat obstructive but
never really threatening. They
don't scare people. they just bore
them.

The quasi-radicals among the

unwarranted and availed no one .

hear what Posvar might have said.
Ithought. pehaps. he was going to
announce a 10 to 15% salary
reduction for the faculty and_ the
administrative staff in order to fend
off the tuition hike. This would
have shown great leadership in the

The Nyden case, as it has
become known. presented an axis
not evinced in the two other
then troubling the
institution. The element of secrecy
raised questions, from -sincere
people. about academic freedom
and professional integrity. The
secret report and the arcane voting
process that terminated Nyden’s
contract renewal seemed like
“star-chamber" procedure abhor-
rent to all liberty-loving people.
Even now. in retrospect, it is
difficult to appreciate the obvious

gggéfear that pervaded the minds of

if faculty and administration on the

morning of the Thaw Hall hearing
ytor Nyden. The questions remain: X

What were these people expecting?

Who lost objectivity that morning? '

During this hearing Dr. Richard
Cloward, of Columbia, ably refuted
and exorcised certain unsavory
rumors bruited about the Pitt
campus in an effort to discredit
Nyden’s dissertation.

Nyden teaches from a Marxist
viewpoint. This idea alone, if
popularized in halftruth and
innuendo via the medium of radio,
can create an unfavorable atmos-
phere for everyone. It can be
unjust. -I recall most vividly the
talk-show campaign (WJAS), a few

“years ago, against Dr. Robert
‘I/UV-" .L * ‘ '.

 Case for Good

Colodny. Colodny had been accus-
ed (such was the milieu of the time)
of being a Communist by one
uninformed parent and the charge
ripped through the community like
a cyclone.

Nyden's teaching ability,»like his
humane decency, is apparent to
anyone who knows him and his
rapport with his students may be a
source of envy for some of his
discipline colleagues who haven't,
been exposed to measles and
mumps and mononucleosis since
Hector was a pup. America needs
teachers like Paul Nyden.

The United States, the nation-
facing the massive Communist
world of Eastern Europe, Asia,
possibly the middle East and
Africa-must have Marxist teachers
if we are toi“know the enemy."
U.S. Troop morale in Korea,
1950-52. suffered because 'our
Americans didn't know who they
were nor what they were ﬁghting
for and against. The result was that
our soldiers who were taken
prisoners by the Reds-many of
them, simply turned their faces to
the wall and died—-—a sort of adult
marasmus. This malady didn’t
affect the Turks on the British
troops who became POWs. Such
reasoning as this may escape the
ivory-tower clique. You can bet

Sense  

your sweet mess-kit that it does.

It is without question that many
members of Pitt's‘ Board of
Trustees are uneasy with the
reform movement within organized
labor. They should be. It is their
world that is threatened by possible
strikes and allied disorders. Nyden,
to a small degree, is relevant to this
reform movement which, per se, is
inevitable and overdue. There
should be no element of surprise
here for anyone. The integrity of
labor leaders and union officials, of
company executives, like that of
politicians, is being put to the
question. Consider: Dave McDon-
ald retired. to Palm Springs,
California. (where he used to play
golf with Pres. Eisenhower and
industry moguls while acting _as
steel-worker chief) as “ﬁfty thou
per"; Jock Yablonski was murder-
ed in his bed by fellow unionists;
Ed Sadlowski is now CL ing‘ on
strong among the steel wmkers;
and Jimmy Hoffa? Who knows?
Who runs Alaska?

It is in the interweaving of all
these multicolored strands in order
to fabricate the whole cloth of
understanding that one must view
the Nyden case. The warp and the
woof of the general scheme
involves campus activity and
attitudes; it involves the seemingly

. , -'I~‘u,esc_1a.y_,_ ..M;iy,.
remote goals of the U.S. Establish-
ment. Paul Nyden. sociologist.
Marxist scholar and labor specialist

is on trial. If he were an’ English ’

teacher the.re would be no
controversy. But he isn't therefore
there is controversy. This contro-
versy has deep roots in the labor
city of Pittsburgh. Every union
person in the area, as did Louis
Angal of the United Mine Workers,
should get behind Nyden-and
push. I would recommend a veto of
all the efforts thus far to dismiss
him.

A great majority of the Pitt
alumni come from “working class"
homes. Labor is part of their
heritage. Remotely. I‘ admit.
Nyden, in his position. may be
considered as a facet of class
struggle. This may be the case.

If so. dismissing Nyden will only
serve to‘ amplify the struggle and
reduce the ultimate benefits for all
concerned.

Let me suggest to the Board of
Trustees that they insist upon the
retention of Paul Nyden, Ph.D.. on
the sociology faculty at the
University of Pittsburgh. Such a
move would but make good sense.

 Food Co-op--I

You may no longer have to hock

street corner shaking a tin cup in
order to pay your grocery bills.
Relief from the crush of food
inﬂation, in the form of a co-op food

has reached the Pitt.
campus. The co-op program.
under the wing Of student

Government, won allocations last

I 8' "month that will allow it to open

today.

What is a co-op food program?
Project chairperson Freida Lalli
described it as a program designed
to sell good food with a minimum of

. “ markup, eliminating the middle-
" man and allowing the consumer to

benefit.
This food service will at ﬁrst
have temporary headquarters in

‘ the S.U ground ﬂoor. The line of

products initially available will be
produce from the City's Strip
District and may expand to provide
dairy products and baked goods,

If ' depending upon the desires of the

students are asked to pay one
dollar and faculty and staff two
dollars, for a full‘ year’s member-
ship.

' Initially, the co-op will follow a
Tuesday-through-Thursday week.
Tuesday will be the ordering day
whena list of everything available
for purchase will be printed. The
buyers choose their products, pay
50% of the amount owed, and
receive a receipt. On Thursday,
the products are picked up and the
remaining bills paid.

“Chain stores mark up goods
approximately 50 to 100%,” Lalli
said. “The co-op will be marking
up food 10 to 15%, using this as a
cover for overhead expenses such
as gas and paper.
will be saving approximately 35%
of the usual grocery bill.”

If there is any surplus of food,
the service will remain open on
Thursday until the extra food is‘
sold. Also, if food is ordered but
not picked up on Thursday, the
deposit will not be returned.

Food orders can be placed today,
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in 302
Student Union. Produce can be
picked up Thursday in the "Student

program cutbacks are considered,
leaves an approximate $2.7 million-
gap. That includes only mandated
costs. such as increased utility
costs due to inﬂation and does not
allow for desirable nonessential
increases on other areas.

Freeman said his ofﬁce “took a
very sharp pencil" to the budget
requests submitted by the heads of
the different University areas,
leaving expenses down to a bare
minimum.

The ﬁgures released by Freeman
are balanced hypothetically to show
the possible ways of meeting the
budget.

According to the chart:

——A ﬁve percent tuition hike with
a ﬁve percent increase in compen~
sation costs would necessitate $3.7
million in program cutbacks.

—A ﬁve percent tuition increase
with a 10 percent increase in
compensation costs would mean
almost $7 million in cutbacks.

—A 10 percent tuition hike with
a 10 percent compensation hike
would mean $5.8 million in
program reductions.

Freeman said the $34 million
mark was the probably maximum
for any cutbacks in programs, and
said it was likely both the tuition
and compensation increases would
fall somewhere within the 'area of
ﬁve percent. He stressed, however,
that the estimate was his opinion

In addressing the assembly,
Frederick Hill. president of Pitt’s

the facilities allow increased

new building will provide for
increased enrollment for students
who would have been denied
admission previously.

When the bridges are completed,
residents will have two means of
exiting—they will be able to go

below the ﬁre or up the stairs and
out through another building if
they are above it. Installation of
the bridges was necessary because
current ﬁre regulations require all

The Surly and the Surrealists

It’s rare for a rock group to

r possess one song in its repertoire

with the musical and lyrical power
to summarize a contemporary
musical movement.

Lynyrd Skynyrd is such a band,
whose song “Freebird” is dedi-
cated to the memories of former
Allman Brothers Band members
Duane Allman and Berry Oakley.
The Allman Brothers were the
musical catalyst that propelled
southern rock into the forefront of
the American ~music scene.

Both bandsappeared before a

showstopping rave-up rocker
“High Tide and Green Grass,” it
proved to be more than enough.

‘After a boring heavy metal-fuck
jam session by ex-Humble Pie
members Steve Marriot, Greg
Rlddely and Clem Clempson; the
headliners Lynyrd Skynyrd ram-
bled on stage.

Lynyrd Skynyrd makes no
qualms about its Southern heritage
--in fact relishes waving the rebel
ﬂag while churning out “redneck”
rock. On “Gimme Back My
Bullets,” “Double Trouble,”
“Saturday Night Special” and the
defiant ballad “Sweet Home
Alabama” it came across like
rowdy street corner toughs with.
moonshine dripping from its lips.

Lynyrd Skynyrd is an undeniably
surly band. Guitarists Allen
Collins and Gary Rossington lay
down nasty, venomous heavy metal
licks, while vocalist Ronnie Van
Zandt creeps around the stage with
the cool of a hired assassin belting
out the blues-.

On April 13th at the Syria
Mosque, Genesis provided a more
mellow, mental-oriented concert.’

It is really hard to describe the
experience of a Genesis concert.
Its music and presentation lift the
senses into fantasies of the
surrealistic, by.continually puzzling
the audience. Genesis has a
brilliant light show and uses
several screens showing films and
pictures at various spots through-
out the show. The music is a cross
section of English heavy metal-
hard rock, classical, and folk, and
when combined with visuals makes
for one of the most mystifying
sensations in rock. I

On Record Spectrum

BY NORM NIARTELLO

In case vou missed out on recent
LP releases, the. following will
serve as a guide. The music spans
the colors of the spectrum in a
rainbow of musical genres.

Red is hot. and about the
scorchingest of this year’s offerings
is a release of Elvis Presley's first
recordings, circa 1954-55, The Sun
Sessions [RCA APMI-1675].

This sound, the sound of Sun
Records’ rhythm & blues, has had
an inﬂuence on almost everyone in
the business at one time or
another. “That’s All Right"
presents a high-howlin’ Elvis that
harkens to_the vocal style of
Dylan's pre Blonde On Blonde
career. Bill Black’s acoustic
boom-slapping bass lends knee-
jerking funk to “Blue Moon of

Kentucky,” “Good Rockin’ To-
night” and “Baby Let’s Play
,House,” as well as the classic

7

“Mystery Train,’ and others.
Instrumentation is sparse and
besides Elvis’ acoustic guitar, and

. D..I. Fontata doing drums on some

of the cuts, Scotty Moore’s
high-pitched electric guitar sup-
plies a surprisingly full sound to
the songs. Moore's hoof-beat
rhythm is especially arresting on
Rodgers and Hart’s “Blue Moon.”

(A plus).
Like a yellow summer sun, Gary
Stewart’s Steppin’ Out I’ [RCA

APLI-1225] is country-comfortable. -

Stewart’s sincerity on soft love
ballads and primal-scream singing
carries the expected tight instru-,
mentation. “Lord - What A
Woman” is country cookin’.. “Flat”
Natural Born Good Timin' Man” is
a slick rocker and there's plenty of
honky-tonk, piano-based work, as
in “If You've Got the Money (I’ve
Got the Time)." Gary Stewart’s
slide guitar and Reggie Young’s
lead should endear this _disc to
swinging rockers. (B minus).

strains and so too Rosie‘~s Better

Late Than Never . [RCA ‘APL1- —

1498] weaves its sound. This trio’s
sound is street funk culled from R
& B, rock, jazz (thanks to the
amazing work of guitarist ’ Jeff
Mironov, baritone saxist Joe Farrel
and conga player Carlos Martin)

Blue is a sad song of the street
and Elliott Murphy's Night Lights
[RCA, APL1-1318]. Often his
straining vocals are reminiscent of
David Bowie’s. His songs are
musical poetry using images Dylan
threw away a decade ago. Still,
this production remains his own.
His delivery is ‘one of skill and
passion in the Sontes-like honky-
tonkin' “Abraham _Lincoln Con-

rocker Patti Smith, “Lady Stil-

longer introspective, but accusing
in “Never As Old As You.” The

 "A 6-2,209 pounder from Youngstown, Cavanaugh stepped in last

Haygood started the ﬁrst seven regular season games, then returned
