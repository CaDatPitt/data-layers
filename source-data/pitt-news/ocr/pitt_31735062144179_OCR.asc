So far, hundreds of students
and faculty members have con,-
tributed to the -drive. Dr. John
Ferguson gave the ﬁrst can dur-
ing a s-kit in the Tuck shop on
Monday, while other members of
the faculty followed on Tuesday.
Miss Ruth Cramblet, director of
University Food service, gave the
first full case of food. Several
campus iorganizations, including
Phi Sigma Sigma, W0men’s

Theta have sent in checks for
two cases. '
Special provisions forltbe ac-

made at the -booth to take care of

Bureau for Retail Training, will
address the Alumnae association
of the University at the annual
spring business meeting and elec-
tion of omcers. It will take place
in the P-atio room of the Hotel
Schenley, March 23.

Miss Goodwin, who served 18
months with the American Red

Pitt Flyiilg Club

Plans Meeting

The -first business meeting of the
Pitt Flying club will be next Fri-
day during the ﬁfth hour in room
G-24 of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing.

“It is of the utmost importance
that every one interested in ﬂying
with the club attend this meeting,
because of the business which will
be transacted,” said Sam I-leggie,
acting president. Among other
things, a full explanation will be
made.“ of the financial arrange-
ments of the ﬂying _course for non-
veterans and for veterans under
the GI Bill of Rights.

According to I-Ieggie, many stu-
dents’ have the idea that the Fly-
ing club is restricted to veterans
from the Air Corps. He emphasiz-
ed the fact that the club is open
to all men and women who want
to ﬂy. “One of. the basic problems
of the club is to get persons who
have had no occasion to ﬂy inter-
ested in the opportunities we can
give them,” he said.

ium of the Stephen Foster me-

Social Events
Inaugurate
Men’s Riisliing

Men’s fraternity rushing open-
ed officially this morning at 8
o’clock and will continue through
2 a. m. Sunday morning. During
this open period eligible freshmen
and non-fraternity upperclassmen
are being considered by the ten
active fraternities on campus.
For the fraternities on campus
the rest of this week will be al.-
mostf_lon§e constant social event.
However, the programs are limit-
ed somewhat by the inter—fra-
ternity rushing rules. No non-fra-
ternity man may stay at a fra-
ternity house past 10:3-0 o’clock
on Thursday and Friday nights,
past 12 o’clock midnight on Fri-
day night, nor past 2 o’clock on
Sunday, morning. In addition, the
rules permit only one mixed so-
cial event during the week, that
to be on Saturday night.

Although each fraternity may
vary from the program slightly,
the following is a general sched-
ule for the ‘four days of rush
week: Each fraternity will have a
luncheon every day -of the rushing
period, and a dinner every eve-
ning with the exception of Satur-
day: night. In the afternoons vari-
ous", bowling and movie parties
are planned.

O.n Thursdays the parents of
thoprospective pledges are given
the opportunity to learn some--
thing of. the operation of a. fra-
ternity and to talk about it with
the’: «parents of the actgive mem-
ber,s. ’

O,nfFri-day evening there is gen-

erally some form of entertain-
ment a"rrang-ed at the various
houses. - '

-Saturday night is the time of

the big social event of the rushing
period. ‘Each fraternity has sched-
uled a dance. ‘Rush week will.
culminate with this dance.

A period of si.len-ce, in which no
fraternity man may speak to a
rushee on__fraternity matters. ex-
tends from Sunday mornng until
Monday afternoon. Rushees are
not limited in the number of Ira-
tenities from which they may ac-
cept invitations. Attendance at
social -events does not involve any
obligation on the -part of the
rushee to join, nor -by rushing a
man is a fraternity obliged to
make a bid for him.

Ea-ch fraternity -“must submit a
list of the rushees to the dean of
men’s office by 8 o’clock Monday
morning, ‘March 27. As quickly
as possible the dean of men’s
oiﬁce will submit these invitations
to the rushees.

The -men’s fraternities are not
limited in the number of men
they «may pledge.

Clinic Conducted‘

By Retail Bureau

Pitt’s Retail Bureau was host
last week to 49 management and
personnel executives from 32 out-
of-town stores and eight Pitts-
burgh stores.

At the meeting in the Cathed-
ral, discussions of salesmanship
training under the direction of
Bishop Brown, bureau director,
took place. The idea for such
a program has grown out of ob-
servations of the various weak-
nesses apparent in retail selling
throughout the war. The Retail
Bureau’s own service shoppings
helped suggest some of the ques-
tions on the agenda for discus-
sion.

actions which speak louder than words? Let’s look at the strike
situation which best typiﬁes concrete action. You state that
Workers by striking are refusing to work! That they are being
spoiled and babied by unemployment compensation! By these
Itwo statements you have leveled an attack on every working
man in America, and Jim, there are quite a few of them! If I
would state that “big business” is refusing to make money, that
it merely engages in business for its health, you and the whole
world would think me crazy! Don’t you think that any state-
ment implying that workers are refusing to work, leaves one
The U. S. Steel Corporation knows
that they would be in a ﬁx if workers put thumbs down on
working for them.

Lct’s get to the bottom of what makes for a. situation where
strike becomes a necessity on :the part of organized labor. First
of all, workers are granted the right to self organization, to
form or join labor unions by the National Relations act. This
act was upheld by the supreme court and became a law of the
land. \Vhot are the rights  these organizations of worke1's‘?
Sectbion seven of the Wagner act states, “To l)aT‘I'g_{lll1 collectively
through representatives of their own clioosing, and to engage
in concerned activities for the purpose of collective barga.ini.1_u.g
or other mutual aid or protcctiion_.” '

What is labor’s position in this early postwar period’? Afici-
pitching in and making the world’s niuiiitioiis to defeat fascism,
labor ﬁnds itself behind the pr0Vcrbia.l “eight ball.” The end
of the war brought to the workers’ pay check it general slash
i11 take-home pay, elimination of overtime, etc. Even during
the war wages lagged behind the rising costs of living. \V‘agc
increases had been restricted by the “Little Steel Formula” to
no more than 15 per cent compared to a 30 per cent raise in the
cost of living. Lab'or’s general request of 30 per cc! it increases
barely meets the continuing rise in the cost of l.i:.iug. Are
workers able to live on 1meni.ploymei.tl; security funds as snutll
as they are, when ttheir full real wage earned from cmploynient
isn’t enough to meet a real stancla.1"d of living‘!

Lct’s look also at capital ’s side of the ledger. Believe me
there are no entries on red ink! It reads something like this :_
employers after paying taxes have amassed proﬁts three times‘
higher than the pre—wa.r year of 1939! I ask you can capital
meet labor ’s demands?

Labor too, has dignity. Its historical roots are deep in the

‘struggle for the rights of man. It ’s progress is the very devel-

opment of our great country. ‘It. was the strong back, the sweat,
the very flesh, and blood that built the railroads, the mines, the
mills. Labor steeled in a terrible ﬁre of strife is you, is me,
is America. Do_n’t conlsecrate it! Raise your angle of ﬁre so
your shells can fall where lies the real nerve centers of reaction
of slavery. That wave of cynicism, of pessimism is their poison
gas! Don’t breathe too deeply or you will ﬁnd yourself a. vic-
tim. Yes, rest assured that the peoples of America, the peoplés
of the world have 11ot lost their zest for freedom, security, for
a free n-1an’s peace that they paid for with their very lii:'e’s
blood. They must ﬁght and continue to ﬁght today for tomor.
row’s future. Aim your guns well! ,

By J. Pettican
During the past two ‘months,
Amcrhta‘ has en?t‘er~'caine‘d a dis-
tin.guishod visu-m~  the person

 of the right honorabic Windéoii
‘vchurchiii, Britain’s great war-

fume loader. Mr. Churchill csine
3h-ere’ as 3 private citizen, repre-
iscnt'm.g no government or consti-
tutional ‘body. In this capacity, he

 do-Iivcrcd two addresses. -one at
"1-‘iittonv, -Missouri and the other

in New York ‘City. Private citi-
zen Churchill has  us
against those infiuéncés which, he
thinks, are m-snzacinrg the poses of
the weird today, and has urged
cooprcrationl bctwegen Britain and
Amcricia in the lbifilding of the
worl-'d’s security.

Thitere are many reasons ‘Why
Mr. ‘Chur‘chill’s doc‘lla’1‘*ati-ons -are
well wo-rth lisjténing to. First of
all, he is «probably the greatest
statesman and world ﬁgure alive
today. When future histories are
“written, he is certain to be the
outstanding individual mentioned
in conjunction with World War
II. ‘Therefore, anything Mr.
Churchill says is backed by both
knowledge and -experience, and
his warnings against Russia must
be viewed in that light.

Today, with the peace treaty
far from being signed, Russia has
already made huge gains out of
World War Il—-both in territory
actually annexed and in the ex-
pansion of her zone of inﬂuence.
Yet. she consistently cloaks her
actions in secrecy and ﬂaunts the
attitude of having the other pow-
ers come to her for discussions or
-settlements. Since the outcome of
Russia’s ‘present policy cannot be
foreold at this time, Mr. Church-
i1l’s advice seems to be thorough-
ly safe, sane, and sensible. Great
Britain. and the United States,
with their great common heritage
of social and cultural institutions,
owe it, both to themselves and to
the things they represent, to
work. together harmoniously and
beneﬁcially until the -present jig-
saw puzzle of -chaos and disorder
has been knit into a stable pat-
tern of peace.

l_.ct’s pa.ra.plirase the popular
ditty “O What It Seemed to Be”
with “O What It Might Have
Been.” Let’s iina-gine the Civic
center, not as it is now, resplend-
ent, but bomb torn and smoking.
Can you see a twisted, smoking
she-ll of a Cathedral of Learning,
a pock marked campus with fu-
tile little slit trenches marking
the last ditch stand of a brave de-

-fender? Forbes Street, with brok-

stu-pidly reaching and
possi~bl.y a stagnant pool of water
and blood? Or maybe the ma-
jestic PAA as a mound of heaped
and shattered stone? Then the
Syria Mosque, -miraculously spar-
ed, resounding to the strains of
not the “Star Spangled Banner”
but the Horst Wessel. Not nice
but it could have ‘been. It is so
easy to forget —- easier if you
have never seen.

A bunch of guys kept a lot of
people from seeing such sights
and feeling such rn‘isé‘ry as might
have been incurred. They wont

Now they’re home—not wanting.

By J. Kann

The address, which Winston
Churchill dolivercd at W'estmin-
ster college was ill-timed, ill-
adviscd and audacious. It was ill-
timed because Russo-American
relations are temporarily strain-
ed; it ‘was ill-advised because his
speech only added to the general
mistrust -between England, the
United States and Russia; and it
was audacious because as a Bri-
ton, Winston -Churchill has no
right to criticize the cxpansionism
of another country.

It cannot be supposed that Mr.
Churchill has left the memory of
the odious, imperialist policy of
his own country in the parlia-
mentary discussion rooms of the
Government, the formerly headed.

-I do not ibelieve ‘1\'Ir. Churchill
has forgotten that Japanese
troops, led by British ofﬁcers,

have fought. ‘against the Indo-
nesians in their fight for inde-
pendence. Mr. Churchill might
very well remember that be fore-
ed a British-friendly government
into Greece in order to make the
English life-line secure. May I
remind the former British Prime-
Ministcr of his own policy toward
the ‘people of Italy and Belgium,
so close to the shores of his home-
country. May I also ask Mr.
Churchill why he does not favor
a revolution in Spain? Could it
be that a new Spanish govern-
ment might press demands for
Gibraltar, necessary for the se-
curity of England’s trade? Would
I,not be within my rights if I
asked ‘Mr. Churchill why his gov-
ernment has not called its troops
out of Egypt and Greece? Could
we not say that it is time that
India received her independence?

Mr. Churchill!
tainly not say that Br!itai'n"s pol-
icies can be explained by a hu-
manitarian -desire to give free-
dom to the people of this world
and spread democracy to its four
corners. After all, people in glass
houses should not throw stones.

You, Mr. Churchill, have thrown

rocks.

cation, still others a home, a life
of their own. They who have
married would rather not live in
“temporary housing units” but
this "they’d rather experience than
live in shared homes. Temporary
as it might be it would better
represent the independence that,
we think, they fought for. Hous-
ing units of the temporary sort
probably don’t represent the ulti-
mate wish of the married vet——-
he'd more likely prefer a modern,
apartinent or ‘bungalow but this
is out of the immediate question.’-

Actually this column doesn’t
know the extent of need for
housing among veterans, but 
the need éxists atfall, ‘even t6
the slightest degree “then it must
be seriously consiidéred. To object
to a possible solution to the prob“-

housing units on the grounds that
such units would be Eye ‘sores or

Replaces W ave

By Chris Manion

If you’ve noticed the Bird of
Paradise roosting -on the lapel of
Blonde Mary Wz—i11isch’s coat, it’s
not because she’s “pinned” to a
veteran-——or is it “ebuttoned”? But,
nonetheless, Mary is a vet in her
own right.

Eight months ago she was
strictly GI a BM 2/c preparing
for Pearl Harbor duty. Today she
is back at Pitt after an absence
of two years. «She lezt school for
the WAVES in January, 1944, but
never fear, school was not behind
her. In the following months that
she was in the service, four and
one-half to -be exact, were spent
in boot training, radio school, ad-
vanced radio school, and over-
seas -boot training. ‘

Mary’s career as a female gob
was highlighted several times.
When her outﬁt arrived at Chat-
ham, -Mass, to relieve sailors
(they were most ungrateful) they
were welcomed by a raging hur-
ricane that held them barracks-
bound for two weeks. Such was

At Scholars Day Assembly

Outstanding students and mem-
bers of the faculty were honored
at the annual Scholars Day assem-
bly last Thursday in Stephen Fos-
ter memorial. .

“The Difference ‘That Scholar-
ship Could Make” was the adress
given by the Rev. Irving R. Mur-
ray, minister of the First Unitar-
ian church. He said that knowl-
edge had its own rewa-‘rd since
nothing could be done or said that
would add to a -persons feeling of
satisfaction in the pursuit of
knowledge. He stated, “Scholar-
ship must be continuous. The stu-
ment must stay on the road of
scholarship to keep the joy he re-
ceived from scholarship. He must
retain knowledge, increase it, use
and develop it.” -

Because scholarship is a tool of
society, it must be used‘ tp solve
the grave problems that man faces
today, was another point brought
out by the Reverend Murray. Add-
ing to this statement, he said, “In
five or ten years, if sicholarship
isn’t used effectively, there won’t
be any need for it. The, human
body and brain will be atomized
if man turns loose these atomic in-
destructable weapons.”

‘The assembly closed with the
singing of the Alma Mater, and
the recessional of the fraternity
representatives and speakers from
the platform.

Good morning, air. (Well, some,
anyhow). The main event of the
day is rushing, and being no ex-,
ception to the rule, yours truly
will no doubt have some poor
rushee in a corner, twisting his
arm. While you are peacefully
reading this column.

To get on with the news we ﬁnd
that the Pitt Phi Delt chapter join-
ed-with their brothers from W.
and J., Allegheny, W. Va., and
Gettysburg _,for a founders’ day
celebrationlast Friday at the Uni-
versity club. As we move on, the
Phi Ep’s tell us that Larry Kal-
stone and Paul Steinlauf were on
leave to supervise a dance with
the Phi Sigs, then a house dance
on Saturday. Both were a big suc-
cess but 'here’s their big news. The
Pilot housers are no longer pilot
housers. Yes, they have a new
house at 5336 Fifth Avenue and
are making plans for moving soon.
The Phi Eps say it’s ge-o—orge-
ous! ,

The Sigma Chi’s tell us they had
a great time last Friday night at
a dessert dance given by the Phi
Mu’s. ‘They are looking forward
to another good time at their an-
nual Miami Triad dan-ce which is
being scheduled for the near fu-
ture. To help keep their reputa-
tion as singers they serenaded the
ZTA’s (on the way to a local hot
spot.)

As we check on the SAE’s we
ﬁnd they have two new transfers
from Cornell U., by name Herb
Mansman and Chuck Roberts. Oh,
yes, and if you have any sugges-
tions as to the C0101‘ the lions
should be painted, get in touch

‘with the nearest SAE, as they are

planning to repaint them very
shortly.

William Zeuger, the Phi Kap
National President addressed the
Newman club communion break-
fast last Sunday at Cathedral

on hand for rush week. We have
heard rumors from over PiKA
way that a good time was had by
all at a tea dance held by the

Grid 1 Drlis Start Today;
85 Expected to Report:

Today at 4 o’clock on the ﬁeld behind Tree’s Gym marks the
opening of the 1946 spring practice sessions for the Pitt footballers.
Fesler and Company warns their gridders to be prepared to hit hard
the ﬁrst day and keep hitting hard from here on in.

The outlook for Fesler’s elevene

isn’t too bright for the coming
season despite the turnout of
nearly 85 candidates for uniforms.
Wes can put that “WANTED” sifzzf
out right now. —— Look at that
schedule.

Looking over the list of candi-
dates you can ﬁnd many a posi-
tion without a named man known
at the present time to ﬁll the job.
The biggest headache lies in the
back-ﬁeld. 'Wes will be out there
looking for a passer; tailback;
blocking backs and a plunging
back. The only backﬁeld spots
which seems in fair shapeis the
running backs with Robinson and
Mosso and possibly Zimmovan
ﬁlling in the spot. Plunging back
problem could be solved if Casey
Ploszay, a former McKees~port
gridder and All W.P.I.A.L. selec-
tion in 1938, will round into shape

The Intramural elimination con-

Quarter-ﬁnals played last Week,
and the ‘Serni—ﬁnals and Finals to
be played this week.

Last week saw the Dental Jun-
iors ‘beat the Engineer B’s 59-34,
in what was termed the ‘fgame of

garnet were one-sided affairs; the
Engineer C’s trouncinig the ‘Phar-
macy Freshmen 29-20, the Dent

ﬁve 44-25, and the -Med Juniors
whipping the Med Freshmen 41-

According to Mr. George E.
Weekes, University boxing and
wrestling instructor and the man
who referees most of these games,
the schedule is a little behind be-
cause of the -basketball court at
the Stadium being declared unﬁt
for use. Therefore the ﬁnals will
be held at Trees -Gym on Friday
form 7:30» p. m. to 9:30 p. In.

-Mr. Weekes also suggested an

ners of the Tournament and an

outstanding players of the losing
teams. This game would be held
next week, probably at Trees

Sports Editor

 

One big question at Sky Scraper U is already 3n3\V€l‘€d§ that 15
the appointment of a new grid coach and the other still in the guess-
ing stage is——wi1l Pitt get into the Big Nine?

Going down the line of possible schools for the Western Confer-
ence opening we find Nebraska mentioned, we eliminate Nebraska
because it’s the seat of the Big Six. Then there is Michigan State.
Michigan State is in the area of Michigan U which isn’t looking for any
competition which might hurt her. Not only that, the Spartans have

a 20,000 seating stadium which won’t bring in the grcenbacks in large

enough number to suit the Biz Nine.

Now what are the Panthers chances. At the present they aren’t
too promising. One of our main drawbacks is the lack of a minor
sport’s schedule and no ﬁeld house. Possibly, if the Panthers can

- show the Big Nine officials that a Field House is in the making and a

full minor sports card will be started such as golf, wrestling, boxing,
and swimming maybe the officials will postpone a decision for a year.
Now it’s your turn to guess.

As far as Wes Fesler’s appointment as head coach giving our
 a boost, i-tfs doubted. According to reports—-Ohio State has
always been mentioned as our sponsorer for a Big Nine berth with
University of Michiganse-conding the motion.

Oﬁ‘ To A Good Start

Fesler’s appointment as head Pitt grid coach caught everyone off
guard, in fact th'e majority never heard of Fesler. That was when
the former All-American appointment was ,announced,.. now he is a
well known ﬁgure in Pittsburgh and vicinity. ‘ '

When Fesler took over at Pitt the outlook for next season was
darker than it had ever been here. Now it looks much brighter. Wes
and his assistants have much to do with that. Fesler’s feelings toward
the gridders is one that hasn’t been found at Pitt for many a year. In
a short talk with West, the ex-Ohio Stater stated that he would be
out there ﬁghting for his boys’ welfare all the time and he hoped the,
boys would fight for him.

Wes you needn’t worry about that. The boys have already
voiced their opinion and they are 100% behind you.

The best of luck to you Wes and staff and I am sure the Pitt
Panther is on the‘ upswing.

Why No Golf‘?  Gommittee

. The Faculty Committee on Athletics decided that Pitt would not
ﬁle a Golf Team ’th',-is year. The decision was made after the com-
mittee reviewed the‘ golf applicants and thought the calibre Wasn’t
high enough to represent Pitt.

Who's kidding Who Mr. Committee. Would you call the past
four Panther elevens -satisfactory representatives of Pitt athletics, I
know I wouldn’t. .You must start sometimes to build a team. Usually
one  at the bottom and works his way up. What would you
prefer--a ‘team to start at the top and collapse after a year or two.

_ Over 27 students ﬁled applications and out of this number a
satisfactory team could be ﬁeldg True we might lose more games than
we win but next year brings another season.

Aside to a well-known group of

Harold Cohen (no relation to

anyone her boyfriend’s name, all
of which makes her unfair to or-
ganized scandal-mongers.

And so terminates our safari of

scandal until next week when
more rumor, ruin, and what-have-

your avid orbs. Incidentally, don’t
forget to get your Mardi Gras
