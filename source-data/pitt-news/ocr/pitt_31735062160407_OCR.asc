an approach is going to have to be
yrnade for the money, however.”
Over $4.5 billion in transit
allocation requests has been
r_eceive_d in Washington. Only $870
million has been appropriated.
The Governor’s proposed system
would branch out over Allegheny,
Beaver, and Westmoreland coun-

ties, and serve lseven principal

corridors including Oakland and
thevEast End. It is this corridor
that interests the Pitt community
and is regarded by the Pittsburgh
‘Area Transportation Study as the
area of “greatest potential transit
demand.” _
The Study’s ﬁndings prompted
Shapp to suggest the research and
design of an Oakland-Hill District

rapid transit line. “Such a facility I

would whisk "passengers from

Allegheny Center to Oakland in

, seven minutes, or from Grant

Street to Bellefield in six minutes,"
the Study reported. A '

I Sex fDiscriminofion Suit: 
Against Pitt Sfo/emoles    

7 BY DEBBIE POPP

Negotiations in the Kathleen
Gentilcore grievance filed last June
clainiing sex discrimination in‘ Falk
Library employment practices has
reached a §tal'eniate. ,

The University of Pittsburgh,

‘ through, the Affirmative iAction‘

Program, has systematically re-

' " fused the 12 points of reconcilation

drawnpup» by the Equal Employ-
‘ ment‘, Oppogrtunities“ Commission
(EEOC). In turn, the University
has compiled its own points of
settlement. V '

Among these proposals which
Gentilcore finds incompatible and
confusing is .-the future role of
Library Assistant I and the
compensation of back pay. ,

Gentilcore initiated the grie-
vance procedure with the Affirma-
tive Action Program and the class
action suit in affiliation with the

.National Organization of Women
(NOW) whenjshe was" not hired as
nighttime Library Assistant I in

p Falk Library. Gentilcore, believing

she’ was qualified but denied, the!

position because she. was -female.
included her instateiment as Library
"Assistant I as a part of’ the
settlement.  ’
"Not conceding to an _act of
A discrimination,.the University has
offered her the =denied job in a
standard practice to thefgrievance.
A hitch to this’ proposal
Gentilcore says, is that-thejob is
considered a special favor with no
_hope ‘of promotion. The _job. will
expireafter Gentilcore leaves, "she
said. 1 ' / ‘

COUP Urges

BY MARCH RUDOLPH

A group of young Pittsburghers,
calling themselves “The Commit—
tee On Un-electing the President"
(COUP) has organized a petition
campaign to impeach President
Nixon. The committee hopes to
link with petitioners in other cities.
They plan to forward the petitions
to congressmen. pressuring them

 to start impeachment proceedings.

To date, almost 5000 signatures
have been collected in Pittsburgh.
“We must have legal grounds to

impeach the President." said Judy

MacLean. spokeswoman for the
group. “We have three’ illegal
actions by the President stated on
the pctition——thc Watergate break-
in. the bombing done without
authorization and the impound-
ment of funds.

“Of course. we feel that many of
his legal actions have also been
criminal." she continued. “The
covert operations all over the
world, the trial of the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War...We
feel all of that is criminal."

COUP is associated with the New
American Movement, a national
socialist organization composed
mostly of young working people.
Many are veterans of the demon-
strations of the 60’s, said MacLean,
also a NAM member.

“Many of us were in a lot of
different movements," the COUP
spokeswoman explained. “NAM
tries to unite all offthese struggles.

“We feel that in order for people
to have decent lives, we must have
socialism in America. Socialism
will be the system under whichwe
could solve these problems. But
you don't have to be a socialist to
join COUP."

When asked how impeachment
will help solve the problems of
America, MacLean replied,
“People are cynical, they feel
powerless. If we work together we
can change things.

“Impeachment is one small
step--a ‘warning. The next
President will have to watch his
step a bit more closely."

The petitioners have been suc-
cessful in getting signatures from
people in all walks oflife, Mac Lean
noted. “A lot of older people sign.
Many say. ‘I voted for him and now
I'm really mad."

really equate Hitler with Nixon‘?

“I do. in that they are both guilty
of destroying a people," she said.
“All of these things (wiretaps,
brcakins) are the beginning of
fascism. but we don't have fascism
now. We're trying to dramatize the
situation."

MacLean thinks the impeachment
effort can succeed. “We have no
power other than large numbers ot
people wanting it."

Scott Praises r s
Nixon's Success

PHILADELPHIA AP --Sen.
Hugh Scott, R—Pa.. said Thursday
the achievements of the Nixon
administration have. overwhelmed
“The crimes and the immorality of
a few."

Scott. the Senate minority
leader. was effusive in his praise of
the Nixon administration during a
speech at the quarterly meeting of
the Philadelphia Bar Association.

Only two “coincidental facts”
have blemished the record, said
Scott, listing the pair as Watergate
and the tendency of foreign nations
to become more confident and
harder to deal with as a result of
the detente begun by the United
States. _

He said the “trauma 0‘;
Watergate has sapped a self-
confidence that might otherwise
have verged on a new American
hubris.”

“We Americans tend in any case
to be the most self-critical of
nations. There are some among us.
who act as though even that whic'
is over-whelmingly good in our free
society were tainted by the crimes
and immorality of a few."

In view of the fact that “Governor
Shapp had recommended the

schools receive no increase over’

last year’s funding, Dr. Elser said
he is “cautiously optimistic” about
the Governor signing the bill.

Powers added “The Governor is
not hostile to education, it’s .just
that his main concerns right now lie
in the areas of welfare, health, and
primary and secondary education.”

In addition to its “relatively early
action on the funding bills, the
Senate has approved a plan under
which monthly payments of funds
to the University would replace the
present quarterly payments. “We
won’t have to wait until December
to pay for October and November,’ ’

AdachiSpeaks onDy

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Christina Adachi, Socialist can-
didate for City Council spoke
Wednesday on “The Revolotion-
ary Dynamics. of Women’s_ Liber-
ation.” Her talk was sponsored by
Young Socialists for LeBlanc, an
organization of students and young
workers. ’ A’

Adachi
feminist movement has_ its roots
deep -inithe militant attitudes of the’
suffragettes. “Although there are
significant differences between the
latter and present day women’s
rights movements...it is important
to say something about the first
wave of ‘feminism, about the
women who laid the foundation for
the present...” I

The chief comparisons ‘between I

the early movements and today’s
according to Adachi were the
dynamics. “Today’s mass feminist
movement is. qualitatively different
from.,the women’s suffrage move-.
ment. It has more than a militant
dynamic, it has a revolutionary
dynamic.”

Adachi sees the present move-
ment as not merely striving for

equality within the system, as did -

the early suffragettes, but calling
for a new orderof society itself.
“The feminist movementtif today
is challenging every aspect of the
oppression--and demanding com-
plete freedom in every aspect of
their lives, freedom that cannot be

, granted without anything less than
a a total transformation of society.”

The oppression. of women,
asserts Adachi, stems from the
structure of society, from basic

we receive in school is one of the
most powerful tools capitalist

for second class status.”

She feels the increasing freedom
of women from the V traditional
limitations is the prime source of
the discontent, limitations which
are the main-stays of capitalistic

‘,3 While paging through my"Web-
_ster’s'_.New Collegiate Dictionary
"the" other night, I came across a
Lwork _that is_probably part of most
‘people's vocabulary, although’ ad-
zmittec/lly one of the less frequently
,used parts. '
 "Effe'minate. ’ ’
'_,fj'l‘,he connotations. of the word are

"experience I can’t recall ever
 it ,_used as a compliment’.
f I.would say that “effeminate”A is
today’ most often learned by people

College Boards or to describe
effectively the fellow whose voice

_ I -‘Either way, you know as well as I
'0 ‘how the word is most often used--it

 word for any reason directly related
'_Tto';the above. 7
lgilnstead, I was curious about the
,-definition of the word born well

_ '.Webster’.s explanation of the
’ Latin-based “effeminate:”
.“I-Iaving marked womanlike traits

In fact, ‘any thinking person who

Check your livingroom during the
next televised football game--that
lump of lard slouching in the chair
and sipping’ beer is probably not

~This discourse sofar makes me
sound like I'm beating the drum for
both gay and woman's lib. I'm not.

I am. however, suggesting that
“effeminate” need not imply-
rampant laziness orlatent homo-’
sexuality. ‘Certainly I'm not going

to change attitudes‘ or .even

dictionaries, but I see no reason to
say woman have a monopoly on
undesirable traits. I

For some time ‘now I’ve noticed
that many older men have a
common trait that makes them

universally offensive. That is, they

have a real tendency to pour forth
their tales of bitterness and
disappointment on unwilling ears.

Of course, there are many bad '
things to say about males, but I use
this as an example I’ know /too well.
Besides, I can't honestly say older
women do the same thing.

I've spoken to many a senior male
who insisted that no one had
greater hardships in life than he.

These were mainly very casual‘

acquaintances (if that much), and
none had endured so much more
pain than the next guy. I

The result has always been a-
one-sided “conversation” that is,
at least, very depressing.

One man saw socialized medicine
in the U.S. as ‘a giant step towards
outright socialism, then com-
munism, and eventually hell.
Don't ask me how he gotionto
socialized medicine in the first
place.

Some concerned soul will surely
suggest that I’m being intolerant of
these men's need to express their
innermost feelings. '

I agree, because I know that

To-the Editor:

In an otherwise fine article about
,the Socialist Workers Party election
campaign, appearing in the Sept-
ember 26 issue of the Pitt News,

there was some phrasing which.

badly distorts our actual position on
the question of taxes. The article
says that we favor “introduction of
a 100% income tax on citizens with

annual earnings equaling or
surpassing $30,000.” Many of
your readers may have been

justifiably shocked by a proposal
which would make so many citizens
utterly destitute.

Actually. our position--as-stated in
‘the “Socialist ‘‘ Workers Party
Program for Pittsburgh’--is for “a

100% income tax on all incomes
For example,»
sonieone making $40,000 would be

able tokeep up to’$30’.000. Also, as
was pointed out in your article.
those making under $15,000 a year
would pay no taxes. Both groups of
citizens would‘ beneﬁt from our

greatly expanded public services-- 0

including free mass transit, free
healthcare. a guarantee to decent
housing, etc. _

To pay for the increased public

Ian

services, ‘we can tor a tax systéiii
that places the principal burden on
the profits of the big corporations.

We feel that the economic
resources of Pittsburgh and the
nation should be owned and
democratically controlled by the
people, "not by a .handful ‘of
corporations. The common owner-
ship, democratic control, and

rational use of our economy is‘

socialism.‘

Anyone who' is interested in
learning more about the Socialist
Workers Party's campaign, about
the other struggles of workers and
oppressed groups which we sup-
port, or about socialism in general
is encouraged_to visit our campaign
headquarters at 304 South Bouquet
Street. _ '

n __ I would like to pass along a story from the lines of
the Associated Press, in the hope that it will scare the
hell out of you. It will do exactly that if you are as
easily scared as I am.‘ ’ '

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A New York man, described

. by authorities as a “genius: who has a history of

-problems in getting along with people” has pleaded
guilty in:-Federal Court to an elaborate extortion plot
and assault charges. \

Glen B. Schubert, 45 of White Plai.ns,'adiiiitted his

attempt to extort $280,00. from Nationwide.

Insurance Co., Oct. 3, .1972 by threatening to blow up
company facilities and injure company employes and-
policyholders. _ "

Asst. U.S. Atty. Jack  Waldman said Nationwide
traced the unusual punctuation in the typed extortion
note through its ‘personnel ﬁles to Schubert...

There is more to the news story, but none of it is
nearly as startling as that “punctuation”.

The whole story is startlingin various ways. The
defendant waited untilhis trial was ‘well underway
before he decided to plead guilty. The offence
charged against him was’ at least unusual: bomb
threats and assaults on the employes of corporations
have become almost a cpmmonplacein our happy
time, but this man found a way to strike even greater
terror than a fear of bombs into the corporate heart of
an insurance company. ' "

Insurance companies collect money all the time.
They pay money out only when their clients are. killed
or suffer specific injuries. They have property, which
is undoubtedly insured, even against bombs. If they
are like most corporations‘, all of their employes are
insured. Indeed, the company itself may be insured
against losses incurred as a result of the death or
disability of selected employes. It is the latest thing
in corporate insurance. I

The one thing to which even a prudent insurance
company is vulnerable is harm done to the people it

insures. The extortionist was brilli_ant.in_ his.-threat,,. -

so far as that goes. His plot had aifatal weakness-.
How- was he totidentify thosepotential victims who

 happened to“have ‘policies with»-the. target company? .
This must-ljiave occurred to.the,comp'any.;"and they: «

could be behind the

The man has

pleaded guilty, and the threat is removed.. But there
»is another threat in this moral tale.

. I refer to the manner in which the man was
identiﬁed. It is in the third paragraph of the news
story. His -punctuation gave him _away.\
, The first paragraph suggests that he_ had‘
“problems in getting along with people”. It Seems
he had an evensworse problem in getting along with
commas and suchlike niceties of punctuation. ‘
Just think about it. The man had been discharged -
years before he wrote his threatening letter. He used '
punctuation marks in an unusual way. How was the
connection made? A

Did some patient clerk xwade through every. A

document in the company’s -posession, only to
emerge, inkstained and - weary, but triumphant,’
shouting ‘_‘Eureka!”?‘ - _ I '

Or had everything in the company’s files already
been comitted to the memory «banks of a computer,

which had no trouble identifying "the pattern of

writing which could only belong to a man ﬁred some
years before? ,
Did the FBI examine the threatening letter, and

compare it to their copies of everything that has ever'._y_

been written in the United States?

I find all of the above disturbing. .A man was
locked up on no better primary evidence than the fact
that he punctuated his sentences in an unusual way.
The fact that he ‘was, in fact, the person who was
being sought does not make the thought less
disturbing. ' '

Perhaps we should all demand that the courses in
English Composition which were dropped as
requisites be reinstalled. And we had better pay
attention. Any small deviation from the generally
accepted norms of spelling. syntax and punctuation
may be enough to mark us for the restof our lives, -
make us so conspicuous that we -can bespotted over

A the mid-1960’s

BY GEORGE ZRUST

The Chemistry Department has
purchased a new electron spectro-
meter for ‘chemical analysis,
making Pitt one of the only two
schools in the country to have such

an instrument. j
In an electron spectrometer,

x-rays are directed at the surface of
a sample material, causing elec-
trons to be ejected.‘ An
electrostatic analyzer separates
these electrons according’ to their
kinetic energies. The resulting
energy‘ spectrum is then displayed
on an oscilloscope or a‘ TV screen,
or plotted on paper.

A. more familiar‘ type of energy i

spectrum is the “rainbow” of
colors producediwhen visible light
is shone through a-prism.

The model 5950A spectrometer,
which here arrived in mid-Septem-
ber, is manufactured by Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto,
California, costing \$152,000. M

‘The entire sum was paid for by a.
grant from the Federal Govem-_
ments National Science Foundation
[NSF]._ - -

Mainly graduate students and
faculty will usetheinstrument to
study the electron structure of
molecules department members"
say. ‘Now, however, the ‘depart-_
ment is only trying to duplicate old
experiments to learn how to use the
device, according to. graduate
student Richard Colton.

Dr. Wayne Rabalais, assistant
professor of Chemistry and Pitt
faculty member for two years, was
largely responsible for bringing the
spectrometer to the University.)

He explained that the field of ’
Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical
Analysis [ESCA] is relatively
young, being developed only -- in
by Dr. Kai
Siegbahn of the. University of V
Uppsala, Sweden. '

 

Because _the NSF, only gives
equipment grants to schools where
there ‘is suficient community T
interest, Rabalais began holding,
seminars at Pitt, Duquesne, ‘and
'CMU. He eventually got the
support of 14 faculty members.

In the summer of 1972 the
proposal was submitted to the NSF,
and in February, 1973, Pitt was
chosen for funding over ﬁve other
schools. ~

Dr.,— Rabalais examined
commercial

three,
brands of electron.

spectrometers, selecting Hewlitt- . u

Packardis because of its unique

‘capabilities.

The H-P spectrometer has higher
resolution and causes less radiation
damage ‘to study samples, in
additionto delivering data in less
time and greater intensity, said
Rabalais. An automatic device
controls the temperature of sam-

ples ranging from -_150 degress to O"

+300 degrees Centigrade. ’

The new spectrometer can also

“ion-etch” samples whose sur-

._faces are coated with thin films like
metal oxides or absorbed gases,

we’ve had it,”, said Dr. Rabalais,

“it has resulted in _some 10,

Processes and Structures

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Student Government. What is
it? Who needs it? What has it
done? What is it doing?

This series of articles on Student
Government (SG) will attempt to
explain ‘the answers to these
questionswhich must cross every
student.’s mind at one time or
another.

In almost every issue of the Pitt
News, there is at least one story
relating to matters of SG. The
majority of students who read these
articles read them at face value and
many times do not know or
understand the complete structure

* of SG,‘ its functions, responsibili-

ties, aims and accomplishments.

Firstly, SG per se is just a
general term used to describe all of
the operations that a
government organization performs.

The most important body is the
Student Government Board (SGB),
which acts as a coordinating group
with the many, various committees
that make up what is called SG.
The SGB also has seats on
numerous councils and committees
within the University administra-
tion which have an influence on the
day-to-day decisions and affairs of
the University of Pittsburgh.

The SGB h_as a responsibility to
inform students of actions and
decisions it makes. Board
members are always available to
tell concerned students how they
arrived at a certain decision and are
open to suggestions and criticisms
about actions and decisions from all
students. a v

Their ﬁles which contain infor-
mation on budgets, organizational
constitutions and minutes from
meetingsare. open to inspection by
students at any time.

Meetings are held weekly on

, There are 17 committees of
which are chaired, unchaired and
special interest, all of which
will be discussed in a later issue.

In relation to the University
administration, Bob Heister, a
spokesman for the board, com-
mented, “SGB feels the University
has certain commitments to stu-
dents beyond the classroom itself
and these concern non-academic
needs which we believe that the
University hasn't acted out in its
full capacitv."

Each year SGB sets a main goal.
This year’s aim has been set and
accomplished which was trying to
centralize the SG operations. -

Now SG paysathe phone bills for
student organizations. Ofﬁce
supplies for student organizations
are currently ordered through SG
to help eliminate waste. ' Also a
booklet for the organizations on
using the new centrex system has
been prepared. —

In the next article, the major and
minor goals that SG hopes to
accomplish this year will be
discussed.

BY M. C. PILECKI

lt happens only occasionally that a
regular movie-goer will walk out of
the theatre without that little tinge
of disappointment that occurs when
a film doesn’t quite measure up to
expectations. It is even rarer that a
film surpasses its own gloating
publicity campaign, and leaves a
lasting impression on the viewer.

Not only did Visions of Eight, now
topple all
expectations, but left one pre-
viously skeptical reviewer stunned
by its cinematic beauty and pointed
insight. At first glance. the film’s
premise doesn't seem to promise
much. Eight international directors
were asked to choose their own
the ‘1972 Summer
Olympics, that Summer spectacu-
lar that flooded world-wide TV ad
nauseum. The movie is a series of
short vignettes. each done on a
different subject in a different
style, thus the_fli_<_:l(__l_ias as so much
cohesiveness as the Olympics
itself: no plot, no characters, no

human drama of sports competi-
tion, with its comedy, tragedy,
triumph and defeat. Admittedly,
the film is not for everybody. Those
who would appreciate it most are
students of “pure” cinema and
those interested in the drama and
color of the Olympics.

The “visions” are quite different.
One segment, “The Strongest,”

concerning the weight-lifters, fo--

cuses on the single-mindedness of
these superhuman/inhuman crea-

' tures, pampered in their struggle.

In an almost too-obvious visual
pun, the shots of the huge titans in
their exercises are interspersed
with rows of sides of beef and pork
being unloaded.

Another frequently comic selec-
tion is “The Decathalon,” where
Bavarian folk singers are cut in
with the athletes. The grand
finale, a foot race, is expertly

combined with Beethoven’s Ninth

Symphony, Fourth Movement,
rising toa crescendo as the racers
near the finish.

The most stunning episode is
Arthur Penn’s entry, “The High-
est,” on the pole vaulters. This

Because it was conceived from thebeginning as a
system, it works as a system. All the elements are
quickly and easily interchangeable. No matter which
lens or accessory you use with the F-1 body you won't
have the feeling that something has been

“tacked on."

What's more the F-1 is comfortable to handle.

Years of research went into the design of the F-1 body
and placement of controls so your fingers fall
naturally into place. You'll appreciate this comfort
when you're on assignment. It's also an important
thing to keep in mind if you're investing in a camera

you plan to keep a long time.

Canon hasbeen in the optics industry over 37
years. We make microscope equipment, amateur and
professional movie cameras and TV lenses. It's this
experience that helps make our still ‘cameras the best
selling cameras in Japan. in America, it's just a matter

of time.

See your dealer for more information. He'll also
show you Canon's other SLR cameras, like the FTb

standard of engineering that goes into the F-1.

complimented.

William Beck as the friar, and John

Harmony

Dischord  

BY MAX EVERETT

On the average of four times a
week, Mr. Donald Downs, a
violinist with the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Orchestra takes his chair,
and along with approximately one
hundred of his peers performs a
full concert. How simple! Imagine
picking up an instrument and
performing all those old, familiar
works you’ve heard since child-
hood. . . and only four times a week!
What an easy task it seems to most
of us....about as easy as perform-
ing brain surgery-and requiring
about as much training and
emotional stamina.

Most" audiences come to a concert
to be~--entertained, and view the
performer merely as the vehicle for
that entertainment. Sitting in front
of us on the stage" he has no real
identity. He is anonymous-one

. part of a whole. Like people we see

daily on the bus, he seems to
actually live in his chair, we can’t
imagine him anywhere else. But
could it be that he may pick up his
instrumerit not four but four.
hundred times a week to rehearse,
practice, or teach? Or that he may
have to put aside a hundred
annoyances in order to give us that
“perfect” performance we so
indifferently expect? Does he think

about what it’s like to be but one -

member of a large group? Does he
concentrate on the music he’s
playing at the moment, hoping that
he’s reaching his audience, or is he
really planning tomorrow night’s
dinner? Mr. ‘Downs answered

, 9 these, and other questions which

concern him‘ and in most probabil-
ity concern all performers.

Mr. Downs focused on one
problem which faces him andiotheri
musicians who perform regularlyi
maintaining spotaneity. ’He said

that often brings into a rehearsal or '

performance preconceived notions
of what the music should sound
like, ideally performed. These
no.ti_ons.have, been formed by many
previous. experiences with»
music.
being too familiar with the music
can be hazardous because it takes"-
. considerable effort to make it fresh
each time. “What we do i's»not
normal. It is a framed ‘experience,

i not a %art of everyday living, and

- being uman we make mistakes or
get angry or bored. And yet we
_have’ a responsibility ‘to meet as
high a standard as possible.”
What exactlyis the responsibility
ofithe performer to his audience? .
Mr. Downs indicated (that ad

_ the '
He went on to say that,

Misses   Musician's Life:  

and     

performer must emotionally reach
those people who hear him, touch
them in some way so that they are
receptive to what he is offering. ‘‘I
worry about the audience-what
reaches them. I often don’t know.”

M,

Sometimes, he said after a "«
particularly strenuous perform-
ance, he watches the people
clapping, sometimes very slowly,
with stunned looks on their faces,
and he wonders what is going on in
their minds. Have they really been
reached by the emotional impact of
the piece, or are they merely
bored? ' Downs believes that the
more musically naivethe audience,
the more responsibility the per-
former has not to cheat them.

Downs says he tries to concentrate
as much as possible on the music at-.
‘hand, but this is often difficult, '
especially when there were .dis-
tractions.

What does it feellike to be one
member of a section? Do you have
to subordinate your soloistic
tendencies to keep the peace? “In
"a way, yes. You should never fall
below your own personal standards
of performance. I still practice‘ ,
hoping 1711 get better,and some-
times I do. All string players are
trained to be soloists but we’re
subjected to the anonymity of the
orchestra, and each one of us has to _
learn to deal with that problem in
his -own way.” ‘“\
Do you ever feel guilty about

being paid for a job you , so

obviously enjoy? ".‘Not really.

After. all,  have to pay the rent like
‘everyone. Art and money don’t
seem to mix well, though, because
after all, how can you pay for a
performance? How _ can you .
measure a creative effort?”

Downs, like all of us «faces
inconveniences. The most impor-
tant ones, nor, he feels are lack of
‘rehearsal time and an overloaded
schedule--over two hunded con-
.certs a year. He said that there was
often not enough rehearsal-time to
give an adequate performance and
that sometimes pieces are ‘re-
hearsed over and-over, and that_
tendstobe boring. “But if\you let _ _
these inconveniences hamper you,
V. you-arerobbing yourself of a great‘
experience. - Boredom, unfai.r
-conditions, or your .own«attitudes
can prevent you from not only
enjoying what you do, but also from
reaching your audience, which is
what it’s your responsibility to do.”

I have some mixed feelings concerning the Pitt student body and
their reactions to Coach Johnny Majors and his efforts to redirect the
football program. Those feelings stem from the reaction of thestudent
section when the Panthers left the field ‘trailing Baylor, 14-0, at
halftime and from some general comments that I have heard or

.. overheard on campus following their subsequent defeat.

As the ‘team trotted to the locker room. they were greeted with -some
mixed emotions from the student sections. The majorit_y_cheered but
there were still.a substantial number of boos for everyone in the press
box to take notice of. On the Monday following the game, Majors
appeared as usual for his noon session at the Student Union to
comment on game films and answer questions. The turnout" had :
dropped considerably from the previous week, after Pitt had surprised

Georgia. Majors sensed that the crowd, thinned as it was, carried a ,

~different attitude. y

There were a few jeers, quiet though, and some of the questions tried a
to put Majors on the spot. The inquiries tried to make Maiors put the
finger on particular players ‘and that he would not do. He has more

i , respect for his playersand is not a man to be pushed into anything. He

deﬁned his purpose ‘at Pitt and declared that he would not banter back
"and forth withianyone at those Monday sessions.‘ ‘ , j '

When you get down to it, those Pitt fans that have already become ’
disgruntled are indicative‘ of the typical Pittsburgh sports enthusiast.
Pittsburgh fans do not rate as the cream of the crop, no matter which
sport you choose to examine. ’ ' A

’ Sure the Steelers have Pittsburghers behind them but look how long
it took them to get there. Pirate fans copped out in the last. week of the
season and Penguin fans slip into the blood and ‘guts category and
really don't understand the game they’re watching. All are quick to
judge, quick to boo, quick to quit and even more adapt at jumping back
on the bandwagon. ' j — , _

‘Pitt fans have just gone through an‘ extremely long’ drought of
victories and haven't been witnessing good collegiate football for some
time. They- are hungry. Majors knows this and that is the reason why
he appears so realisticaly cautious at every opportunity. He has
guaranteed nothing but good football and entertainment at Pitt
Stadium. He hasn’t' let anyone down. . . .

Anyone that has paid the price of admission to a game ‘is entitled to
voice an opinion and that can’t be denied. But cut the guy a break and
look at the situation from his point of view once in a while. Majors has

' the youngest college team in the nation, a team that will make mistakes

‘due toinexperience. Tulane coach Bennie Ellender called his team

young the other day. Only four Tulane freshman are makingthe trip.

Pitt will have five times that number and most of them will play with

regularity. A . '

Tony Dorsett has already blossomed into the greatest freshman in
college football today but look at Carson Long, who hasn’t kicked a
field goal yet. Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was more upset at
losing Long to Pitt in the Pennsylvania recruiting battle than he was

\

over losing Dorsett. _ ‘ _ . A_
As far as tomorrow is concerned. it will be Pitt’s toughest game to

date and could verv well tell the tale of the Panthers’ ability to remain

consistent. The key to the game will lie in the Pitt defense, the part of -

their game that lacked something against Baylor but came back against
Northwestern. - .
Gary Burley is back 'at middle guard and will add strength to the
Panther pass rush. To stop Tulane, Pitt must stop quarterback Steve
, Foley, the Green Wave’s leading rusher. He likes to run from the
pocket without hesitation and will prove to be a tough test to-Pitt’s'
defensive line. Contain Foley and the Cats have it. A

running his regular five to ten

miles a day with a friend of his from
the Villanova track squad.

This is all part~of Bill's program
to get his legs, especially his right
knee, into shape for the soccer
season. It's that knee that has
undergone four operations since
his freshman year at Pitt.

‘‘I didn’t play last year because
of my knee and I still have to get

‘ my muscles in shape from laying in
bed in the hospital for two weeks,”
says the brother of Pitt center
fullback Ray Rex.

The knee is giving him no
problems this year, though. He’s

already been able to generate .
V enough speed to be called one of

the fastest, if not the fastest’ on the
soccer team.

“Running with the ball is‘ the.

thing I do best, and I’ve got to take
advantage of that,” says Rex “but
the most important thing for me is
to use it where I can help the team
the most. I’ve got to play with and

nearly 20 freshman to the Varsity,
among them Tony Dorsett, Robert
Haygood, Don Parrish, Carl Stowe
and others. h
“Every freshman that has
proven himself has had the

Leahy. A ‘

But don’t let that fool you, Leahy
is taking a JV team to Keyser,
W.V. this weekend that is full of
the same “pride and enthusiasm”
as the rest of the Pitt football
program.

Pitt will be playing a '50 defense
and running out of the pro I with
spilit backs just as the Varsity does.

Potomac will have a probable 4-3

Despite building up knowledge
over the years, Leahy still

“This is another education for
me,” commented Leahy.

How well be educated his J ayVee
team will be more evident after

doing my job." j

Bill’s main focus is on team ball,
andhe has a few good reasons for
feeling that way.

“We don’t have anyone on the I

team who can really do it all,’.’
commented the speedster, “and
even if I know that I can run all
around the other team’s fullback,
chances are I’m not going to be
able to score anyway, but if I can
feed the ball to Joe Luxbacher in
front of the net, I’ll know that I’m
playing well.” '

Hustle is Bill Kex’s trademark,
and he lives up to it in every game
he plays. He’s even been chastised
by Coach Bemis for hustling too
much. V

“Bill is constantly running,”
says Bemis, “and near the end of
the game he has to slow down
because he’s just about spent
himself- from running too much.”

“I don’t think that I’m in as good
enough shape as I should be,”
commented the dean’s list student,
“but I think that I’m getting there.

_._ all,

She mmg I canlt do, though, is
worry about my knee. After four
operations it’s hard to really worry
aboutlit anyway.”

“I only look towards the future,
said Bill, “after all, it’s no sense
pouting aboutthe past and that’s
why I’m really psyched for our
game with Temple. I’m not usually
psyched that much for games, but
tomorrow I’m‘going out there to{
prove that Pitt has a good soccer

team and I’m an important part of .

it.” 1
“Sure, I know I’m good, and I

cocky," says Rex, “but if I don’t
think I’m good, then who will?”

RugbyTeam St1'ugglesOnp

BY G. W. STEVENS

Last year, a brave group of Pitt
grad students got together and
decided to form" their own rugby
team. Being anew team, they
weren’t able to get much of a
schedule together and, of course,
they were limited by a lack of
funds. Neverth/eless, these cour-
ageous young men kept at it,
playing‘ just about anyone who
would give them a game.

Well, things are looking up for

the future of rugby here at the
The Pitt Law School‘

University.
Rugby Club has? finally gotten itself
established and has been able to
get a full schedule of nine games.
But, rugby is still only a club sport
and it still suffers from the same of
sort of problems which afflict such
organizations.

The biggest question mark,

facing the club at this time is where
to play their home games. They
have been given permission to use

Schenley Oval, but only if it doesn’t 1

rain for 36 hours prior to game
time. As a result, all home games
are questionable. The team has
been trying toﬁnd a more suitable

‘place to play, and there is some

chance that they will get to use the

practice field behind Trees Hall.
The club also ‘has the usual

problem ‘with funding. They have
