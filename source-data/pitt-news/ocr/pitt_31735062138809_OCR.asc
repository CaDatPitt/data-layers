ACADEMIC   QUESTION

Professor B. L. Ullman of the Uni-
versity, as a professor of Latin and.
also president of the -Classical Asso-
ciation of. Pittsburgh, inter-
viewed last week by a “Sun” reporter
on the subject, “The Revolt in the
Academic VVorld Against the Empha-

\V' 21 S

sis Being Placed on Vocational and _

Industrial Training.” The article ap-
peared in the edinti-on of the Pittsburgh
Sun, Tuesday evening, March 26th.
In the discussion of the subject Prof.
Ullman said in part:

“Auroa mediocritas, the golden:
mean” of Horace, seems to me the‘
solution ofVtheip’roblem in the present
conﬂict between vocational and
called culture in our schools and col-
leges. There is no denying that vo-
cational courses in our schools are an
excellent thing and have come to s-ta_v,
but we must not be carried off our
feet -by the idea, or else it degenerates
into a. fad. VVe want progress——rapid
progress~—-in education as in every-
thing, b11t we don‘t want to be like
feathers tossed about by any chance
breeze. The trouble is that the en-
thusiastic sponsors of vocational
training usually believe that it is a
patent ime(licine for ‘all educational
ills, and to the studentasking to have
a prescription of culture ﬁlled, they

WEEKLY

SECOND SURVEY REPORT   _

MADE BY DR. HOLDSWORTH

The Question of Better Dwelling
Places for Workingmen Is Dis-
cussed. '

THIS PROBLEM‘ IMPORTANT

 

Dr. ‘J T. Holdsworth gave out his

second report in connection with the

economic survey which he is making
for the city late last week. In this
report takes up the important
question of giving the working men
of Pittsburgh‘ suitable homes at a
reasonable cost per month. This
problem ranks next to t'he food sup-
ply question, according to Dr. Holds-
WO1‘l”,l’l.‘
of suitable dwellings for the working
population, he says:

“No more iniportaiﬁ consideration
enters into the question of a com-

he

munity’s’ industrial efficiency than
that of adequate and comfortable
homes for its working population.

I , After the provision of food supplies

shelter makes the most inexorable (le-
mand upon the income of the wage

earner. If 40 to 50 per cenit. be ac-

.cepted as the average proportion of

income required for food, 20 to 25 per
cent. may be ﬁxed as _the require-
ment for rent. Numerous investiga-

tions show that while the amount paid
 for rent increases with the increase of r

income, the percentage of total family

‘expenditures paid for rent tends to
- decrease as the income increases.

“In general the workingman cannot
afford more than a wcek’s pay for 2.
month’s rent. The item of rent in the
family budget approaches more nearly

a ‘ﬁxed’ charge’ than food,‘ clothing,

fuel and light or any other item.
When thrc-ugh non—employmeut, part

time sickness or any other cause, the.
‘built in Lucknow, N. India, as a me-

income is curtailed some reduction of
expenditure may be made all along

dthe line except in rent. This item can-

not be reduced ordinarily except by
moving to poorer quanters or by tak—
ing lodgers. Either alternative is un-
desirable. While it is in general true
that the average American is prone to
spend more upon his home for the
sake of appearance than is consistent
with the best fiscal economy, thereby
reducing the margin available for food
and other physical and spiritual neces»

. sities, it is also true that in thousands

of cases they workingman is compelled
to live in crowded, unsanitary and in-
adequate quarters because of the nar-
row range of his income in the rent
equation, supply or the lack of it oc-
cupies a disaproportionally large posi-
tion. The enormously increase, the
supply -does not keep pace with even
the unstimula'ted demand.”

This problem will not solve itself
according to Dr. Holdsworthm The
question is a very complex one. Of
this fact he says: I

,“Again, let it be urged that the
problem of providing the right kind
of low—priced dwellings in sufficient

Speaking of the importance.

quantities is not one that will solve
itself, nor one that may safely be left
to the imaginary equilibrium of sup-
ply and demand. The problem is diffi-
cult and complex. In Pittsburgh it
offers p'ecu_liar difﬁculties because of
irregular topography, high land
values, inadequate Itransit facilities
and other obstacles. Generally’ speak-
ing, real estate dealers and builders

have found it more profitable to

operate in high-priced‘ properties, and

but scant attention has been given to
the workman’s home. »

“In ‘order to insure a permanen«t
labor supply some of the largest steel
and electrical concerns in the ‘district
have found it necessary -to erect
houses to accommodate at least a part
of their employes. At best this plan

of erecting company houses can
promise only a‘ partial relief. In -
Philadelphia, Baltimore and other

cities the system of ground rents and
the building and loan associations
have made possible the construction
and ownership of thousands of low-
cost, sanitary homes. In other cities
like Cincinnati, Washingt_o1i, Boston

and Chicago private and semi-public‘
enterprise is becoming interested in.

providing low-cost,

men’s dwellings. Many of -the indus-

trial centers of Europe have success-3

fully coped "with this problem,
ance companies, especially
many, have large sums

In closing Dr. Holdsworthwtakes up
the great value of co—operation in the

THE 1913 OWL.

The 191.5 Owl is now rapidly near-
ing completion. The board is prom-
ising a publication which will give a‘
complete review of the year. The
members of the 1913 Owl board have
been working hard for several weeks
in order to be in a position to issue‘
-the annual publication at the earliest
possible time. Through the .many
shake-ups which occurred in the staff
of the Junior publication this year the
work on the book was greatly de-
layed. The members of the board
have sh-own great persistency in car-
rying the work to "a successful con-
clusion. ln the face of almost «insur-
mountable diﬂiculgties they have never
despaired. It is to the ﬁghting spirit
in the Owl board that we owe this
year’s publication. Vl/hen the book is
s-hould do
his or her best to increaseits circula-
tion. A large sale is desired by‘ the.
managersof the Owl and no student
aside from the value of the book to
him personally should neglect to‘pur-
chase’ one of the books.

 

Y. M. C. A.

A movement is now on foot to re-
organize the Young ‘Men’s Christian
Association in this school. During the
last ltW0 years, owing to the great
number of activities in the school and
the many chiangesimade in the sched-
ule, this ass=ociat'ion has been practic-

’are_ studying

ally asleep. It is full time that the Y
M. .‘C. A. awoke from its “Rip Van
\Vinkle” sleep. There is great field
in this University for such an organ~
izaition. There is much work for its
members to do. Only the-n_1en are
needed. \\’ith the strong demand for
suc-l1 an organization which confronts
us, no effort-_should be spared to place
the Y. M. C. A. up'on a thoroughly ef-
ficient basis. There are earnest men
behind this movement, men who VVlll

put their whole souls in the work.
They deservelthe support of every
man in the Uiiiversity. And we be-

lieve that w"ith energetic leaders no
difficulty will be met in _re—organizing
this Christian Association
power for good in this institution.

A meeting is to‘be held in the near
future to elect ofﬁcers for the ensuing
year. Every man interested in the
work of this organization should be
present at this meeting. No matter
what the clifﬁculties and obstacles in
the way, the Y. M. C. A. is going tr;
become a great force in the University
of Pittsburgh. Every man who (lesircs
to accomplish something, every man
who desires to take part in the re-
fonnding of an organization whic-h will
prove one of the strongest in thc
school, every man who desires to aid
in a work of which all will be proud
should attend this meeting. The Y.
M. C. A. has become aroused. _._\_'o
longer will it slumber. through the
year.’ Under the new aggressive spirit
dominating its leaders, it cannot fail.

An Economics Club.
Editor Pitt‘ Vveekly:
Dear Sir :-I desire to call attention
to the need in this school for a club
which would have for its ‘main object

the discussion of questions in political
science and economy. Many of the
students in the School of Economics
these qtiestions which
are so much discussed to-day. it zip-
pears tome that many of the men so

-engaged in their studies would wel—’

come the opportunity to organize in
such a club as I suggest. It is in the
active participation in _
that the practical results of our'train-
ing here appear. A thorough discus-
sion -of the problems which are con-
fronting our educators and legislators
now would constitute t'he.best possible
training. VVe can not secure too much
of that kind of knowledge. I heartily

desire that the many students in the

departments of economics, political
science and sociologyimay organize in
such a manner as I have suggested.
Yours sincerely,
An Economics Student.

paign for a student building little has
been done in the last few weeks. -it

the Commonwealth A
to consider and report upon a revision‘
of the corporation and revenue laws
of the Commonwealth-:

Dear Sir:

The Legislature of Pennsylvania on
1\-‘lay 23, 1911 (P. L. 1150), adopted the
following resolution: ~ ii

“Resolved, That the concurrent res-
olution approved ‘May 13, 1909, en-
titled ‘A concur.rent resolution provid;
ing for the appoinutnient of a joint
committee of the Senate and House

hereby extended as follows: That the;
present president pro tempore of thei
Senate shall appoint three senators
and the present Speaker of the Housel

of its members, which shall constitute;
a joint committee, whose duty it shall:
be to consider the laws of this Comm

of Pennsylvania ‘

monwealth relating. to corporations.

and to revenue and the practical work-g
ing thereof, and to report to the Gen-3.
eral Assembly in 1913 whatever!
changes may be deemed necessary;
therein, together with the draft Of {mi
act or acts of Assembly to accomplish?
said changes, and together with such
recommendations as may be deemedl
necessary relative to the administra-

 propriatrion

tion of existing laws or as to the ap-
pontionment. of said suggested act or
acts. Said committee shall have
power to elect its own chairman, to
sit afterthe adjournment -of the Legis-
lature, to employ legal counsel and
such other_ otlicers and employees as
may be needed to enable it to proper-
ly perform its duties as ‘aforesaid; but
its expenditures shall be limited to the
amount provided therefor in the gen-
eral appropriation bill to be passed at
this session of the Legislature, and
shall be paid out of the State Treas-
ury upon vouchers signed by the

The committee is collecting data
upon the formation, regulation and
taxation of corporations and the ap-
propriation of State Revenue for all
purposes, in this State, in all of the
United States. by the Federal Govern-
ment, and by other nations. These
subjects are being specially discussed
and legislated upon at the present

tion of all interested in these su_bjec‘;s
and requests your opinion as to any
defects in the present laws of the

Commonwealth relating to the forma-_

tion, regulation and taxation of cor-
porations, associations, partnerships

;or individuals, the exemption of them

or any of them from taxation, the ap-
of the revenue of the

.,State, and any changes therein which

you may think necessary.

You will notice that th_e resolution
requires a report li’.O be made to the
Legislature in 1913 and we, therefore

;request an early reply, as it is, impor-
Itant that all suggestions be received

for consideration prior to the public
meetings which the committee may
hold. We should -also be glad to have

MARSHALL WINS BUTTON.

A cross—country run was held last
Wednesday and the new course was
tried out byﬂthe track candidates. Di-
rector Miller laid_ out a course pre-
vious to the run which started at the
University and extended through
Schenley Park to the music pavilion
near the long Oakland bridge and re
turn. ' The distance is supposed t-o be
two and one-eighth miles, but it is
thought that it exceeds this by a
sm.all amount. On account of the run
being up hill and down hill and being
over Chard roads, the Director made
the time limit. thirteen minutes and
promised a “cross country button” to

Matt Marshall was the only one to
finish within the limit and so only one

‘button was awarded. The time ofithe

winner was 12:37 and the next to

cross the line was Opsion in 14:00.

Many of the men hope to win this
button but it takes more than ordi-
nary training to accomplish this. The
runs will be' held every Wednesday
and Friday at 3:30 and all candidates

who have not handed their names to_
Director Miller are requested to do so?

COMMITTEE TO COMPILE

mittee for approval, the names of

This committee proposes to go over
all minutes of_the athletic committee

able, and ascertain the names of men
to whom letters were granted. Manv
of the University’s old athletes will
also be communicated with and asked
to furnish names of all men who com-
peted on the ’varsity . «teams during
their day.

An investigation will then be made of
each particular case before recom-
mendation is made to the general ath-
letic committee. This is a nratter of
vital importance and the committee

asks _the co—operation of all who are

versed in the affairs of our athletic
teams during the years mentioned.
The work of collecting this data
will probably consume several months
so that ‘die revised list will not be

ready for publication before next fall. ,

All communicaltions should be _ad-

because of the influence they"have had
on the minds of men.

But the classics, especially Latin,
have a practical value as well.» Just
because they are cultural does not pre-
vent them from -being useful. For a
good knowledge of English and other
modern languages Latin is particular-
ly helpful. To most professional men
it is invaluable. Nothing has
been found to take its place. One
hears on every hand that the students

0 VVH

vsfho have studied Latin, or better yet ‘

Latin and Greek, are better students
in other subjects. Subst.itutes tried
at various times have proved to be
failures.

The classical teachers in the schools
of the Pittsburgh district are to ha‘

particularly commended for their in-

\ terest in the Classical Association, of

‘which they ‘fOI‘1l1 the largest part. This
(organization now completing its ﬁfth
year, has been reiriarkablysticcessfnl
and has become of the mos-t important
organi7.a'tions of its kind in the coun-
try. -
In the association, which is open to
all persons interested, the teachers
have an opportunity in the course of
the six meetings a year to discuss the
aims and methods of classical study,
as well as hear papers of interest and

value by me-mbers and by disti.n-
guished scholars brought here as
‘guests of the association. No one at-

tending one of our lively meetings
would go a/way with the idea that the
élassics are dead yet.

 

University \of California students
will have 110/ excuse for being late in
the future. The University has
/erected a $25,000 set ofchimes.
