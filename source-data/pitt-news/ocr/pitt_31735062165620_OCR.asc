.C0nservative Outlines

V Challenge Of Future

-_

By JACKI KATZ

There is too .much power

_ centered around a small
‘number of people and not
_enough individual -freedom
'for men, according to Frank

Meyer, senior editor of the '

/.-._.y- National Review, who spoke be-

‘ fore about 100 people at the Pitt
Political Forum Lecture Monday
night. '

Speaking on the topic “Freedom
the Forgotten Goal,” Meyer, an
ex-Communist explained thatthe
American republic had ﬁrst set up
a limit of government to the
proper sphere at home and a
“don’t tread on me policy” abroad.
f‘Now we have theppolicy of peace
at all costs and ‘better Red than
dead’ abroad,” he said.

He said that “the only outcome
for peace when the enemy is com-
munism is to face the challenge

FRANK MEYER
From lef: to right

and torefuse to do what we have
been doing for the past 17 years——
to retreat and retreat and retreat.”
Meyer stated that a big noise
was made about Cuba strictly for
an election purpose and, para-
phrasing Churchill, Meyer stated,
“Never has rsosmall a man been
»- able to snatch defeat from victory
as Kennedy has in the ‘past few
days.” '
Meyer, a conservative, feels
that the free enterprise system
i should be in effect. He also
‘states that social institutions
must‘ be judged by the way in
which they expand or retract
freedom.’

Stating that communism is the
major enemy of the American
republic, Meyer commented “that
the only way for the American
government to solve the problem

.of the Communists is to pass a
resolution recognizing the war
which the American Communist
Party has been waging on us since
1917.” . ,

Meyer says that the Socialist
and Liberals as well as the Com-
munists do not give men much
individual freedom, _and that con-
servatism feels‘ there must be a
transformation of society,” one in
which freedom is seen as a true
goal for man. - S .

“Our task’ is to recover this
heritage, revitalize it, take it
abroad, and to act so that -pass- F
erbys may know we did not let
things ' pass away through a

. dream,” Meyer continued.

Meyer ended his speech by say-
ing that, “In our Western tyranny,
the freedom that inspired the ‘birth
of our nation is in our power to
make freedom live again.” ,

Answering questions following
the lecture, Meyer stated . that
Conservatism is‘ an anti-Commu-
nist policy and that-education is
a privilege and not a freedom.

At the beginning of the present trimester, Student

. Government, as described bythis newspaper, was in a “Do

or Die” situation. ‘After almost being voted out of existence,
last year, the organization assumed an extremely ambitious
agenda for the 1962-63 sessions. A brief evaluation of how
that program has been carried out and what remains to be
done can now be made.

SG took up many projects this term; some old, some
entirely ‘new. It promoted the most successful Book Ex-

’ change to date, succeeded in publishing a widely needed"

and appreciated student directory and organized a satisfy-

-ing Homecoming which, although somewhat ﬂawed, still

tops similar affairs of recent years. It also went to the stu-
dentbody for its opinion on the "Alcohol Proposal and acted

' ‘according to the students’ wishes on that issue. In addition,
 SG is presently sponsoring- the Pitt Chest -drive throughout
 the University. ,

Such success in these and other programs have greatly
strengthened the image of the Senate in the eyes of the
students. And the organization itself is functionally marked-
ly better internally: meetings are well attended, the rela-
’tionships between the executive and legislative branches
have greatly improved and more serious business than ever
is being discussed. "

SG isifar from ﬁnished with their business at hand,
however. Based on the success of this term,_it has decided
to hold another Book Exchange, and is considering a new
edition of the Student Directory. The Senators are already
at work on the idea of re-instituting deﬁnitive student
identiﬁcation cards. Reactivating social life during the
winter trimester is also under consideration.

One of the most challenging projects which SG has‘

established for itself is the programming for foreign stu-
dent relations. , The committee working in this area, which
will be discussed in the next issue of’ The Pitt News, has
already attracted much interest, hit snags, and caused some
degree of controversy. It, like the other future plans of SG,
must be approached‘ with careful thought and considera-
tion. .

But SG now has a vastly better foothold for the future
than it did at the beginning of the term.

 Modern Pleas  

    

Ross Louis Safko,.Dlane Sederoﬂ‘. Stun Stein, Bernie Trumpower, Rosita Whitman,

I was confronted Saturday with ‘pleas from
three charities. Walking upthe long hill to the
Stadium, I encountered members of Circle K selling
peanuts as part of a Kiwanis drive to raise money
for blind children. There was
no question in my mind as to the
worth.of that campaign. Like
many others I bought ‘a bag of;
peanuts.

That evening at a movie’
theatre I watcheda short film
shown during intermission in
which James Stewart asked the
audience to contribute funds to
medical research. The campaign
is undertaken by members of the
entertainment industry in mem-
ory of Will Rogers.

While‘ the management of the theatre‘ didn’t
ordinarily permit solicitations, they were- making
an exception for this one worthy cause, the ﬁlm
explained. The drive is conducted'in theatres only
once a year, they added. Again, there was no ques-
tion in my mindras to the Worth of that campaign.
Along with most of the audience I dropped some
change into one of the boxes which the ushers were
passing through the rows.

That same day our Christmas Seals —— cer-
tainly another worthy charity — had arrived.
Earlier this fall I had been in another theatre when
theiﬁlmed plea ‘had been shown. I also remember

   

seeing members of a veterans’ group selling poppies

outside the Stadium before a football game. And,
the Pitt Chest is now sending letters to students
for its campaign. . ~ \ , 5

Fund-Raising Teleihons _

Television stations donate time for spot an-

nouncements concerning charities, and entertainers
appear frequently on fund-raising telethons. We
are constantly bombarded through the mail, tele-
vision, and radio by numerous appeals from. char-
itable organizations: Because fund—raisers must
compete among themselves for the publics’ atten-
tion and money, many of them have undertaken
advertising campaigns, trying to “sell” their charity
just as dog food, shirts, and automobiles are sold.

s

' ' ‘South (American Crisis . . .

By Barry Gross

Earlier, fund-raisers realized that the American
public could ‘become overwhelmed by the number

of worthy causes- Consolidation of many drives
into community chests and united funds, and re-
striction of solicitations for particular groups to one
time of year are two ways in which this problem
of numbers has been combatted. Another is the:
efforts on various levels of government to warn the
public of the.-fake charities that try to take ad-
vantage of good will. .

In spite of these measures, many.people, be-
cause of the wave of requests for contributions that
roll in through every communication medium all
year long, are becoming somewhat hardened to
the pleas for help. _
Large Scale Responsibility ‘ ~

. If a charity is going to take the responsibilityr.
for those people over the entireleountry afflicted
with one disease, it has to be run on a. large scale.
If it is to successfully compete with ._,other chari-
ties, it must utilize all communications, media. And,
if its pleas are to be heard *among the babbles of
advertising which dull the ears fo Americans, they
must be carefully engineered by -the experts -
the members of the advertising industry. ‘

"Another approach to fund-raising resembles
tithing used by churches. It would be interesting
to discover /how much the average American gives
to charities" each year and to compare this amount‘
with the ten percent of salary ﬁgure usually asso-
ciated with tithing. Some charities that are- ad-

‘ ministered by religious organizations sit down with

people and help them decide how much they should
contribute in a year. Then they arrange‘ time pay-
ments to meet this amount. '
Assailed from all sides by pleas from ‘organized
charities, disturbed at the thought that many of
them have duplicate’ functions, and over-exposed
to both these pleas and to commercial advertising‘

through powerful communications media, the aver-

age American, generous as he is, may become in.
time‘ hardened to the all-too-numerous requests. If.
this "occurs, consolidation of various charities. may

.continue. and perhaps someday it will become de-

sirable and. possible to" help all of them with one
contribution, . ‘ - - -

   Yanqui, Bring Money  

By Jim Kleinberg

I

. -In the /smoldering aftermath of the Cuban crisis,
one fact remains unaltered by the show of Inter-
American unity at the diplomatic table: Latin
America is still a hotbed of revolution and unrest.
No amount of destroyers or
planes will correct the economic, .,
social, and political problems
that continue to plague the Latin
American nations. _ .

It was this realization, along
with the enormouspossibilities
for Communist takeovers in
South America-and a vitriolic
hatred of the “Yanqui” that
moved Presidents Eisenhower
and Kennedy to enact the Alli- '
ance for Progress. This massive
aid program had as its goal ﬁve basic projects:
First, education on a massive scale to wipe out
illiteracy; Second, land and agricultural reform, .to
distribute the land more evenly and to- raise pro-
duction; Third, tax reform, instituted and ad-
ministered by the country’s government; Fourth,
general public works development, such as roads,
dams, and hospitals; and Fifth, the establishment
of new industries through Foreign Aid and private
investment. '

Rough Southern Sailing

All of these projects have had rough going dur-
ing their short lives. The industrial development
of Latin America, for example, has fallen off tre-
mendously because of the fear of conﬁscation by

a hostile government. American investors are so
concerned over present holdings iri South America
that they are unwilling to risk more capital on
politically unstable shores. It is possible that the

 

success of the Cuban affair will give private in- '

vestors a greater feeling of security.

However, it should be realized that the muzzling .

of-Fidel Castro’s overt hostile actions does not
preclude a lessening of the covert and inner sub-
version of the Latin American nations.

As , long

form, there are really onlythree bulwarks against
its advance into this hemisphere. These are eco-
nomic, political, .and- military strength. Economic
strength can be bolstered by foreign aid and by

private. investment. Political strength can. really‘?-

be achieved only when there is a healthy economy
and social justice. Finally, military strength rests
on the ﬁrst two barricades. "H

_.It would be a tremendous strain for the United
States to patrol’ the entire- mass of Latin" America
constantly.‘ Not only would it be a strain, but it

certainly would not be pleasing to the Latin Amer- '

icans, who have had enough, of the “Colossus”
image of the United States. What, then. can we
say is a foreign policy "that meets our“‘three bul-

wark” needs the best? ' .4:

Four Point Polic."y~

First, we must continue to funnel vast amounts
of aid into.Latin America, making sure of its
direction ‘and appropriateness. Second, we must
pursue the goals of the Alliance for Progress with
"utmost haste. Third, we must encourage private
capital to enter Latin America. Fourth, we must
keep an alert vigil for Communist subversion and
threat of takeover in Latin America, and be willing
to use force to» eradicate such a threat.

The speed with which these actions must 'be 7-

taken is the key. Theodoro Moscoso, U. S, Director
of the Alliance for Progress, has said that it is “One
minute to midnight in Latin America.” He is right.

- We may have held back the hands of the clock
for a few.weeks in October and November, but the
gears are beginning to turn again. Brazil, a
country of enormous resources, faces severe eco-
nomic and political diﬂiculties — Argentina’s [ate
remains cloudy —- and all of the Latin American
countries, big and small, suffer from malnutrition,
corruption, and dissention.

As President Kennedy said many times-in his a‘

ﬁrst year in ofﬁce, “Things are going to get worse
bef°1'e they get be’C'CeI‘.” We can bé‘su're that the
Russian Bear has not‘ breathed his last in-. t

Honor Given
Student Poets

Two , University sophomores,
Anne Fertik and Barbara Rosen-
bloom, have had, their poems ac-
cepted for publication inthe Na-
tional Poetry .Association’s Annual
Anthology of College Poetry.

Miss Fertik’s poem, .“Happiness
Doesn’t Grow On Walls,’? tells of
a man who isolates himself from
the rest of the world with ‘a wall.
This poem was one of seven she
submitted to the Association ‘and
one of several’ she submitted to
Ideas and Figures this year. Ideas
and Figures is publishing three of
her poems in,i_ts next issue.

Miss Rosenbloom?s. poem, “The -

Madonna,” tells of thefeelinlgs at-
tributed to a statue’. She has sub-
mitted other ‘work to a poetry
magazine, but has not heardfrom
it yet.
Submitted Poetry
Both girls submitted their
poetry in response to an article
printed earlier ., this trimester in
The _Pitt News which told about
the Anthology. _ 
Miss Rosenbloom received
notiﬁcation about her poem in-
theymail last Friday, but Miss‘
Fertik was unaware of the re-
cognition of her poem until she
was interviewed.

Miss Fertik, a writing major,
-and Miss Rosenbloom, as yet un-

decided, both intend to continue
their writing‘. Miss Fertik enjoys
writing poetry and Miss_ Rosen-
bloom ﬁnds’ it easier "to write
poetry than prose.

No Christmas Dance

Scheduled

There will be no Christmas religious aspect had anything to“
Ball this year due to lack ofl

student support, according to Tom
Raschella, president of Men’s
Council. '

“There has been _no student
support previously‘ so we see no
reason for having the dance this
year,” Raschella stated. “The loss
ofxmoney doesn’t matter but the
time was bad and therefore the
turn out was very small.” Men’s
Council lost about $100 to $150
each year.

According , to Raschella, .the
budget. for the dance was con-
stantly cut due- to the. loss.

. No‘ Need

“The students didn’t seem to
need the dance now because they
have so many other activities
during the fall trimester,” he con-
tinued._ “Also, either the dance
would have’ to be in the middle
of ﬁnals week or else too early

By MARILYN EIGES

The educational institutes of
Germany are presently attempting
to loosen the shackles of deep-set
rigidity in their system, according
_, to Dr. J .‘Allen Pfeffer, head of the
, :University’s German department,

gwho recently returned from a year
of teaching in Munich.

Dr. Pfeffer experienced this
. rigidity while teaching in Munich
__in a university geared to the sys-
tem of education for the intellect-
V ually elite. In Germany, only the
very top portion the privileged
1% of the total population, will
be enabled to attend a university.

Pfeffer found that, “Rigidity
was carried into the university
,which was narrowly directed to-
dward humanistic training with a
minimum of science and math, To
. compensate for this, students may
attend technical secondary schools
and institutes. Unfortunately, the
decision of future goal must be
.made by a student before he en-
iters, secondary school. This pro-
“ duces conflicts.”

Complained of Narrowness

_ ,Qn the contrary, the German
"educators encountered by Pfeﬁer
complained of the narrowness of

our educational system. This nar-

A , rowness is best seen in Pfeiffer’s
field of languages.

During his stay in Germany
and travels elsewhere in Eu-

" rope, Pfeffer encountered a
high amount of multi-linguality
among the people. This is a re-
sult of the placement of begin-
ning language training in the

‘approximate equivalent of our
fourth grade, Pfeffer estimated
by a count of actual hours, one
year of training in a foreign
language in this country to
equal only 3 weeks training in
Germany because of the greater
intensity and span there.

Dr. Pfeffer found his German
colleagues in language training re-
quired to reside abroad before
teaching, and that grammar and
conversation were completed in
the secondary schools," University
study’ being devoted to literature.

Enjoyed Privilege

While in Germany, Pfeffer en-

_;loyed the privilege of belonging

There are no assignments

Although Pfeffer encountered
no direct instances of nazism, he
heard of several demonstrations

questioned, most Germans tried to
disclaim all association with oc-

although Munich was only a short

Air: Force Afnnounces it-ique

Plan For Officer Build-Up

 

owe - "

The United States Air .Force has announced an oppor-
tunity for upperclassmen who will graduate in December or
April to obtain a commission as Second Lieutenant without
any Reserve Officer Training Corps background. '

In 1961 it was decided that the Air Force must increase

the size of its officer corps.

Program has been directed to pro-9

cure 5400 new officers this year
because of this decision.

Although the AFROTC is the
largest single source of officers, it
can only operate on a long range
To meet the immediate
need for officers, the AFROTC in
colleges throughout the United
States has orders to inform ‘Stu,-_

_ dents of the stepped-up officer

procurement program, under
which male g‘raduates.whol are
found eligible will "take a. 90 day
course at Lackland Air Force

' Base, Texas.

Pilot Training

After completion of the course
and commissioning as Second
Lieutenants in the USAF, they
pilot or navigator
training or training and dutyin
such non-ﬂying career ﬁelds as
finance, engineering,
scientiﬁc and weather.

Those in ﬂying categories will
have ﬁve years active duty and
those in non-ﬂying career ﬁelds,
four years. ‘

Colonel William C. Tinsley,
professor of air science at the
University, feels that “the oppor-
tunity for personal satisfaction
through responsible service to the
nation is greater now than ever
before in our history. I hope our
Pitt men consider carefully the

"opportunity they now’ have. This

could well be the proverbial turn-
ing point in their lives.”
A letter explaining the pro-

‘gram and a questionnaire have

been mailed to every upperclass-
man. Any eligibile students who

-do not receive letters should in-
quire at 435 CL any time during-

school hours. M

FAST BREAK

Pitt basketball has suffered perennially from two serious
drawbacks: only mild undergraduate interest and a conse-
quent reluctance on the part of good high and prep_school
players to come to a university where the sport is treated so
lightly. ’

Two years ago, however, the school unwittingly recruited
a powerful flock of basketball talent and is now confronted
with the agonizing problem of what to do with a good

._ basketball team.

These players were deﬁant enough, or, perhaps, stubborn
enough, to buck the odds in coming here. The students should
be brave enough to catch the team this Saturday at the start-
ing block ‘against Purdue. ' 4
New Yorkers Love It

The inﬂux of New York stu-
dents here should increase
the student turnout since
they love their basketball.
'They’d even Watch the Rens
if they could get in with their
invoices at the CiviceArena.

There is the promise of
an immensely e x c i t in g
team here this winter with
a flock of excellent juniors-
» whom Coach Bob Timmons
calls “the b e st overall
shooting club that I’ve had
here.”

Timmons admits, that this
year’s team is as good as his
1957-58 team which racked up
a formidable 18-7 record and
earned a berth in the NCAA
tourney, when All-America
Don Hennon was a junior.

Timmons. has a squad
that’s deep, seasoned and
speedy and- should ‘be tour-
nament-boun'd. The only-
flaw apparent at-this time
‘is in the rebound depart-‘
ment.
 “Last year we went with
four "sophomores quite a lot,”
Timmons says, “and we lost
a lot of games in the last few
DGVG ' 5009" moments. This year those los-
ses should-turn over- to the other side of the ledger.”
General Mus-l Lead . . _

If they coalesce around a strong ﬂoor General — brawny
6-4 Brian Generalovich, a pre—season All-East selection —
they will be contenders all the way. The General will take
over this winter and his 15.6 scoring average ‘should soar
along with last‘ year’s 12-11 team record. _

“The student interest has picked up,” the General says.
“A lot more kids have been asking me about the team this
year. They want to know how good we’re going to be and
things like that.” I _

Last year’s scoring leader, guard Calvin.Sheﬁ”ield, may
drive more this year to bolster his 16.3. scoring clip, which
topped the Panthers last year in that department. '

Timmons has been especially happy with the shooting
accuracy of 6-4 Dave Sauer, who averaged nine points a
game last year, mostly rone-handers froin far out. Sauer,
however,‘ is basketball’s answer to football star Paul
Martha who is erratic in his stardom.

Sauer can either make baskets with the nonchalance of

- a Navaho squaw or he can’t buy -a ﬁeld goal. Consistency on

his part would make icing go on the cake with more ease.
Grgurich is Key’ ‘ _ _ _

Pencil—thin Paul Krieger, 6-6, will be up front in the
three-in, two-out offense, with a reported better scoring
touch than the one that notched seV_en a game in 1961-62 as
a sophomore. The ﬁfth junior is guard Tim Grgurich, who
Timmons insists is a demon on defense and a good feeder.

Timmons says he is the key to the season. Personally
I’m afraid to unlock the door. Grgurich is, of course, the
guai-terback of the club. V .

The only trouble is, of course, Grgurich. He’s listed at
5-11 in the brochure. His friends insist that he’d be two
inches taller if he’d only stand straight up, instead of slouch-
ing like Gloom, Inc. _ ' _

Hennon, the former All-American who has been working
with" him, is conﬁdent that Grugurich can do the job. We
are, too, if Grgurich is conﬁdent of himself. .

Dukes, Tech
Meet First In
Season Tip-Off

By ART FLEISCHNER

Students and fans will be
in for a surprise this Satur-‘
day night when they view the
1962-63 edition of the Panther
basketball team. Coach Bob
Timmons boys will host Pur-
due, a team they lost to last year,
86-70, at Purdue.

‘Duquesne and Carnegie Tech
will meet in a prelim at _7:l5 p.m.,
while the Panthers should start
about 8:45 pm. '

Coach Timmons has installed a
new offense, the “Auburn-shuffle.”
The object is to work the ball
into a man in the pivot for a lay-
up or a short shot. Each player is
supposed to go. into the pivot for
an equal amount of time.

_This season Timmons will go
with an all-junior unit. He has
seven lettermen returning and ﬁve
of them that will start are jun-
iors. ' -

Forwards Set

At one forward will be Brian
Generalovich, 6-4, and 220 pounds.
The other forward is Dave Sauer,
6-3 and 198. The center position
will be taken by Paul Krieger.
Paul is the Panthers “big man”,at
6-6.

-In guards Cal Shefﬁeld, 6-0
and Tim Grgurich. 5-11, Coach
Timmons has _two fast men.
Sheffield led the team in scoring
13813 year with a 16.3 average.
According to Timmons, “Grgur-
ich is our best defensive play-
er.”-

‘News’ Hawks Get

Invitation to Play

‘ Duquesne in Bowl

The Pitt News Hawks football
team bowed .to the" Penn State
Daily Collegian Cowards, 12-7,
last Saturday prior to the prelimi-
nary contest at the Stadium later.

Because of the loss the Hawks
have been invited to play in the
“Iron Bowl” this ’Saturday at
Schenley Oval against the staff
football Lteam of the Duquesne
Duke at 2 p.m.

This game will serve as a pre-
lude. to the Steel Bowl at the ﬁeld
housel The Duke Dunces were to
be coached -by Mike Rice and,
Clyde Arnold, but these two are
reported to be on the traveling
circuit with Buddy Rodgers et al.

Hawks Brood

The Hawks meanwhile are still
brooding about their fourth loss
in the sixth annual renewal of
their duel with the men of Mt.
Nittany.

The visitors scored one in the
first period and again in the
third period to jump to a quick
12-0 lead. The Hawks stormed
back, however, and scored /on a
seven-yard pass from Bob
“Keep Cool” Wishnev to Jim
“Juggernaut” 0’Brien.

O’Brien threw to Norm Keller
for the point after. The Hawks
were stopped at the Lion two-

the game.

stated, “We are a fast-break-
ing team and we don’t expect

cord of 17-7.” This seems true

‘Soccer T eam’s Loss
‘Anticlimatic’

MARCUS .

“It was a little anticlimatic,” signed soccer coach Le
Bemis, accounting for his team’s 2-1 loss to Penn State last

Saturday.

It was only the Panther’s second setback of the year.
Their ﬁrst came a week ago when Maryland rallied to. knock
them _out of the NCAA championships, 4-3. Prior to that they

won seven and tied two.‘

Penn State notched their third
win of the season here after post-
ing "a 2-6 mark before, including
to Maryland and Wut
Chester. They dealt Bemis his
only regu1ar—season defeat.

"“We lost basically because we
missed opportunities to score at
the beginning of the game,” Bemis
said. “But the team was down

 after losing to Maryland in the

big game.

“The fellows just couldn’t get
up for it emotionally as much
as they should have,” Bemis
added. “They just couldn’t get
together as a unit.”

. The Panthers actually led the
Lions at halftime, 1-0, after Sam
Donatelli scored in .the second
period. Center forward John Ka-
tona evenedthe scoring midway
through the last period, and in-
side left Jay Stormer decided the
affair with a 45-yard shot.

Bemis is already making. plans
for next season. “This team
worked hard all year long,” he
said, “and I can see already where
we will have a little more scor-
ing potential next season. We’ll
have four of the ﬁve men from
the starting line returning.”

Improvement over 1961 statis-
tics was evident this time. The_
Panthers outscored the enemy,
37-18, c_ompared to a 24-23 edge

, last year. 7
’ Corky Cuthbert top the scorers
with 15 goals, two more than his
leading total a year ago. He set
an all-time career mark of 32,
eclipsing the old record of 24 by
Jerry Bressanell in 1955-57.

Sophomores George Shimpeno
and Dave Reichenbach were next
‘with eight‘and six goals, respec-
tively.

Cuthbert tops the list of ﬁve
graduating players, who also
include both co-captains, Rich
Venglik and Paul Liberati,
Chuck Dunbar- and Jerry Yos-
pin. Liberati, a serious candi-
date for All-America recogni-
tion-, will prove a. big loss.

Venglik and Dunbar were both
starting fullbacks and the de-
fensive allignment will have to be
bolstered to erase their loss. Yos-
pin was a valuable alternate up
front.

lGymnasts Aim
At Better Mark

In New Season

Although their season does not

begin until January, Coach War-
ren Neiger has his gymnasts
working out daily at the Field
House.

The coach has two main ob-
jectives for‘ the upcoming season,
both of which are directly related
to each other. The ﬁrst objective
is ﬁnding a replacement for Earl
McConnell. McConnell last year
won the EIGL championship; was
third in «the national and was
selected as a All-American in his
specialty, the free exercise. His
graduation has left a gaping hole
in the team.

If an adequate replacement
can be found for McConnell,‘ it
will help to solve the second
aim. This aim is to improve on
the 4-4 record the team posted
last year.

Despite the loss of McConnell
the team retains a solid nucleus
for this season. Returning are
Ed Zamecnik, an. all
around gymnast who specializes
in the horizontal bar, Senior Bob
Pingatore, long horse, Juniors
Roland James, side horse, John
Franchuk, parallel bars, and Ed
Stim, parallels and horizontal.
Help is also expected from the
freshman team of last year.

 

Football Losses Shouldn ’t

Coach Loses Tenn
Veterans; Only
Six Won Letters

By BOB SMIZIK

An unusually large crop of
returning lettermen will give
Coach John Michelosen some
comforting thoughts to hold
him through the Winter as he
tries to forget the lack-lustre
season his ‘gridders have just,
come through.

If all goes well academically
Michelosen will have six ends,
four tackles, ﬁve guards, three
centers, three quarterbacks, four
halfbacks and two fullbacks, all.
with plenty of experience for next
season.

The only losses from this sea-

son’s team are tackle Gary Kal_-
tenbach; guards Ralph Conrad,
Tom Brown and John Draksler;
center John Holzbach; quarter-
backs Jim Traﬁcant and Sam
Co1ella;‘halfback Ed Clark‘ and
fullbacks Lou Slaby and John
Chisdak. ” '
Guard Losses

The heaviest losses"will come
at guard Where three top-ﬂight
performers graduate. Yet there
are ﬁve experienced reserves
ready to take over.

Bob Sorochak, Jim Irwin and
Jack Price will give the team
plenty of_ depth at‘ right guard
and Jeﬁ Ware and Bernie La-
quinta will handle the left guard
slot.

Center should be a strong .point
next year with‘ Marty Schot-

tenheimer, Paul Cercel and Chuck »

Ahlborn all returning.

Experienced Matmen
Rely on Sophomores

The deﬁnite lack of" exper-
ience which denotes the 1963
Panther wrestling team be-
came more marked last week
when senior Paul Wilson was
pronounced out for at least

two months due ‘to ,a dislocated
elbow. -

Wilson, one of only six squad
members who have ever seen var-
sity action, did not compete last
year, but turned in a 1-1 mark in
1961 and also won a match in the
Eastern Championship, all while
wrestling 30 pounds over his nor-
mal weight. -

An exceptionally strong wrest-
ler, Wilson was the leading can-
didate to handle the chores in
the 147-pound class for the mat-
men. . _
Vets in Minority

This leaves only Jim Harrison,
Ken Barr, Jeff Ware, Dave Osmun
and Chuck Shaffer as wrestlers
who have made varsity appear-.
ances. Osmun only appeared in
two matches last year and Shaf-
fer did not wrestle at all.

Coach Rex Peery will have to
count heavily on inexperienced
grapplers to do the job for him
this year. -

Peery will have little to worry
about in the 123 pound class if
Mike Johnson can make it aca-
demically. Johnson was one of

Pennsylvania's greatest high
school wrestlers as proven by his
four state titles and an 84-0 rec-
ord in scholastic competition.

Others up from last‘ year’s
frosh who‘ could go a. long way
towards making the 1963 season
a successful one are 130-pound-
er Tom Heniff, 157-pounder
John Carr and 177-pounder Lee
Hall.

Like Johnson, however, the
threat of academic trouble hangs
over their heads. The loss of any
of these sophomores will mean
trouble for the team.
