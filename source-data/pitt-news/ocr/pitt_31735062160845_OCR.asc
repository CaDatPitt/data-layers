Police cars cruising around
the fraternity houses in Oak-
land present the best indica-
tion that Spring Festival is
well underway.

Last week, the police re-

ceived several calls from neigh-
bors complaining of noises during
the early hours of the morning as
last minute carnival preparations
were being made.

“Planetary Promenade” fea-
turing Art Mooney and his or-
chestra will mark the conclusion
of the Spring Festival this Sat-
urday from 8 p.m. to midnight
in the Commons Room.

Featured during intermission
will be the awarding of trophies
and the crowning of the queen. ~

The semi—formal affair will in-
clude dancing on the Bigelow
Court, weather permitting‘, ,,

Mooney has two records that
have sold over a million copies.
His latest record is “Something’s
Always Happening on the
River.” Cathy Ryan will be his
featured vocalist.

Tickets may be obtained from
Miss Turley in the Dean of Men’s
Office, at the Student Desk or from
Herb Dodell, Business\Manager.

Prices will be $3.75 in blocks, of’

ten, $4 regular, and $4.25 at the
door.

Bob DiCicco, publicity, chair-
man, stated “The Pitt Wit-maga-
zinc is one of the finest in the
country. From all indications, a
satire‘magazine’s appearance in
the Spring Festival will add
greatly to the affair.”_

Today the Spring Festival Com-
-mittee will sponsor Dr. J. H.
Wright at the Midday" Series. He
will speak on “Future Potential
and Problems of Nuclear Power.”

A display of Shippingsport

Atomic Reactor Plant will be in-
cluded in the program.

Zero 1114011 Oakland

Pittsburgh police will begin
a “Traffic Law Enforcement;
campaign” in Oakland today,
according to Louis Rosenberg,
City Safety Director,

The campaign will be in the-"
area bounded by Craft Ave.
and Craig St. in length and from.-
the-Stadium, to the Boulevard of‘
the Allies in width. . C

During the inext few weeks.
there will be a “general tightening
up on all pzirking violations” in
the area. This ,wa_s revealed by In-
spector Thomas Martin of the Po-
lice Traflic Division. . A

He said that there will be spe-
cial attention paid to violations
of laws with regard to meters, yel-
low lines, drives and entrances,
crosswalks, no parking zones and
time limit zones. _ C

This enforcement campaign will
affect many members of the Uni-
versity family, students, faculty
and administration who, park on 5
the street. A

In past months many parking
spaces, which were formerly all
day free spaces, have been
changed to restricted areas. These;
will be among the areas which
will be checked for v-iolations by
the police. ’ ‘

Among these areas are Fifth-
Ave. from Bigelow Blvd. to Belle-
field St., the Plaza, in Schenley
Park in front of the Carnegie Li-
brary, and many other areas with
parking meters. ,

According to Inspector Martin
there will be tagging on both city
and state violations. Tags will be
of the “complaint summons” var-
iety. These summons must be
paid within ﬁve days or the case
must be ‘pleaded in Traffic Court
in that time. .

Fines for the various violations
range from $2 to $10. _ W 7 ’,

“Did your polio shot
hurt, Jackie?” 

What is pain? Is it the quick prick of a needle . . . or the slow
breaking of a heart?

If you’ve ever seen a child . . . or a mother or a father . . .
for whom the Salk vaccine came too late, then you know true
pain. Because you know how it feels to have your heart torn,"
piece by piece, from your body. V

Imagine, then, how you’d feel if you were to see—or be-—a
polio victim who could have had the Salk vaccine...and didn't.

It's almost unbelievable that this could happen . . . yet last
summer’s statistics show that perhaps it already has . . .

In 1956, polio cases were reported down 47 96 from 1955 . . .
and down 59% from the five-year average for 1951-1955. And
cases dropped most sharply in the group which had received
the most vaccine. This was the group of children, 5-9 years of
age, first allowed to have the limited vaccine. But, tragically

’ enough, not all these eligible children were permitted by their

parents to have the vaccine.

Can we afford to let another polio season go by without
giving our children—and ourselves-the protection of the Salk ‘
vaccine? For, bad as it is to see a little one struck down by
this disease, it is just as heartbreaking to see a mother taken-
from her family by polio . . . or a father left helpless and ‘un-
able to provide for his family. ‘

Polio, it must be remembered, is not exclusively at chil-

‘ dren’s disease. Although it strikes m.o7v'e often in the lower
age groups, it hits hardest among young adults. That’s why
everyone under 40 years of age should be vaccinated.

So get your shots’ now-today—and take the whole
with you. - ,

No, your polio shots won’t hurt-compared to how your
heart will ache if you neglect to have your family vaccinated
. . . and then polio strikes.

f amilg .

oowr mass roux LUCK. It takes 3 months and 3 am? -» .

iections for maximum polio protection. START YOUR
SHOTS NOW. And protect the whole family.

With, all the furor about the weakness “of scien- L

tiﬁosecondary education, the utter neglect! of gifted
students, a Pittsburgher who’s been doihg some;
thing ‘about’ it for many years has ﬁnally been
recognized. » ' A .
Lon Colborn, former .Taylori —Al1derdice High
School chemistry teacher, has '
had a lifetime__ of experience in
grooming students in A, the subject
of chemistry andvastly improv-
—ing their abilities to think, ana-
lyze, ‘and, make value judgments.
Feature articles on the non-
conformist teacher have ap-
peared .in Newsweek and the
Pittsburgh Press recently. He has
been honoredxby the American
Chemical Society and received,
one of Carnegie Tech‘s rare hon-
Colborn remarked in friendly .conversa,tion'to his
students many times while at Allderdice that the
Pittsburgh Public School System looked down upon
‘his course. ’ ‘ ‘

He was not given the ﬁnancial support to buy the

equipment necessarylto the accelerated course he

“taught nor" was his salary at all commensurate with

his ability. _

« He was’ the center of controversy for (much of

the time he taught at Allderdice. He was accused
.of Eatering to a very small percentage of the stu-

dents ‘in his classes and letting the rest fall by the‘

The fact remains that even the “C” student from
a. Colborn class was far better preparedthan the
“A” student from chemistry classes in other~high
schools. Their performance in their later education
is indicative of this. _ J L A

often the subject of heated discussion among his

students.

This is above and beyond the time the- students
spent in Colbornls general chemistry classes, the
parallel of many first—year college courses. _ ,

The tests.in Qual class were geared on a very

high plane and C-olborn boasted that‘his students

did no better after having taken theicollegecourse

in Qual than they originally did onthc exams.

He’ taught 25 years at Taylor -Allderdice and
many of his students‘ are attending the University

Colborn has a right to be bitter about ,his ex-_'

perience‘ in the Pittsburgh Public School System.
He had been recognized by the ACS and Carnegie
Tech, but the Public Schools failed to give credit
where credit was due.‘ v’ _ _ —

It was only just that Colborn leave the school he
had served so well to take the far more lucrative
-position in Monroe, Louisiana, sponsored by the
Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp.

In _his new position at Neville High, Colburn is
teachinganother version of the same class he
taught in Pittsburgh. His salary in the new location
is $10,000 per year. ~

'Colborn risked possible failure in the new pro-
gram, but he never was one to resist a challenge.

He had nothing but a one-year contract in Monroe .

which has; since been renewed.‘

The successful teacher believes that teachers
should be given a position of prestige as is typical
of the European school system. They should be paid
according to “their ability, “

._He is proving to the country that the program

he devised, derided by the Pittsburgh Public,

Schools years ago, wasefar from unnecessary.

New Dimension gln Conception A

By Nathan Maryn

On Monday, Sept. 22, the University will take
another‘ vast step forward. in the ﬁeld«- of higher
education. K

Not’ only is that the day that most classes begin
for the 1958-59 academic year (without triterm),
but it is the ﬁrstday of classes in the new Graduate
School of Public and Interna-
tional Aifairs. ,.

This first day of classes will 1

 

planning period in which the
idea was conceived, the school
was set up, preliminary paper
work was done andﬁnally, only
several weeks ago, information
about the school in the form of
a provisional bulletin was sent 

to prospective students.‘ \ - " “*-

The idea behind the. entire’ program’ is to pro-
vide graduate professional training-for people who
can enter positions of publictrust. These positions

are in three major areas. Government, commu-

nity organizations and international agencies.

The School itself is broken into ﬁve fields of
concentration. They are General Public Adminis-
tration. Municipal - metropolitan §~Administration,
Administration of‘ International Affairs, Planning

and, Urban Development, and Community Affairs

Administration. ‘
Only the ﬁrst three will be open to students
degrees in the coming year. i ._
Planning and urban development will be a joint

program with Carnegie Institute of Technology. It

for

is designed to provide training for_.p1anners. L-Its-

courses will link together ‘design with administra-
tion, analysis with action, planning and law with
public service. ' ‘

The p/lannedprogram for the concentration in
Community Affairs Administration is to provide
training for administrators‘ of voluntary associa-
tions. Its curriculum.will provide educational ‘back-

ground in understanding ofl.eadership,*function and-

management. ,

But what of the larger program and the pres-
ent? . _' ‘ . A V
A The planners of the School, in opening the
concentrations of municipal, public and interna-
tional administration ..have opened one of only a

few schools in the world, to train .people to enter,
1 these; ﬁeld’s..  . , p " H ‘ 1 ’

  
     

  

They and the staff and faculty of the school
themselves have records of action‘ in these very
ﬁelds, and in high places. , *

Starting at the top, Chancellor Edward -Litc‘h—

ﬁeld himself, has a record of service in business,‘

international work, public service as well as higher A
education. It was he who provided much of the '_

initiative for the creation of the school.

Donald C. Stone, formerly directorof admin‘is- ’

trator of the Economic Cooperation Administration,
assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget and

' Executive Director of the Public Administration,
Service as well as other positions, has been select-‘ 

ed to be Dean of the School.

The school is structured. to include "various ex-
isting facilities and faculties to enhance its scope. .,

Administrative Science Center, a new study and
research body will provide. a place for students to
gain further informatibn regarding administration.
This information will be in the form of theory,
psychology and investigation results. Some of its
staff will teach in the School. '

The Institute of Local Government, a part of "

-the University since 1944 will’ also be an integral
part ofthe School. It will move from its 23rd’ ﬂoor
Cathedral location to the Schenley Apartments,
where the School is located. . i

As a study and service center for municipal of-
ﬁcials and organizations its information and courses,

used for practicing administrators in-the area, will 5

also be available-to the students and

Staff of the
School. ‘

Overall, the School will endeavor to “provide its '

students with insights, understanding and motiva-
tions which, together with a broad background in
‘administration, will quaify them for eventual_p1ace-
men_t in important policy and leadership positions.”

“Not only does the School plan to provide, its '/

information to students who are economists, po-
litical scientists, socio1ogists,.and. others who have

training in the social sciences, but it will also pro, ,

vide its facilities to those who already have pre-

fessional training in many ﬁelds. '

The school has already begun {to accept stu-
dents for its first year. The first to beiadmitted is

a student from Thailand. This points up the fact

that, even before it is in operation, the Graduate‘ in

School of Public and International Affairs is‘  _

Gridders    Training;
- Co-Captains Pick Teams

By LARRY HAGGERTY

Local football customers will have a chance this Satur-
day to ﬁnd out if it’s true what they say about the P_anther’s
new offense in football when the annual intra-squad game
takes place at Wildwood. The kickoff is scheduled for 2:30.

The men of Coach Michelosen are supposed to open up

and pass more next fall out of a formation that includes-
pwingbacks, split ends, etc., but so¢

far. they’ve done most of their
spring practice work behind clos-
ed doors at-Ellsworth Center.

‘ Blue and Gold Co-captains Don

Crafton of Donora and Ed4Mich-

aels from Elmira, New York, will
choose up sides either today or

tomorrow. Michelosen will also
split his coaching staff for the en-
counter. ‘
Depth Shown .

A clinic for area football
coaches will be held in the morn-
ing at the Stadium unless bad
weather requires it to be held in
the Field House. Michelosen and

his six assistants will head the

clinic.
After three weeks of practice,
one thing is quite deﬁnite. The
' 1958 Jungle Cat squad will have
depth, something that was sadly
lacking last year. Nineteen let-
ermen are returning from the
1957 Panther team.
:Much time and work has been
devoted" to the Blue and Gold’s
new offense which will‘ feature a
general wide open attack. The
Panthers will be passing more
this season than they ever have
since 1951.

Veterans Lost
_ Both of last year’s quarterbacks,
Homestead’s Bill Kaliden and
Ivan Toncic from Midland, have
looked impressive in practice
drills. It is no secret that the suc-

cess of the Panther team will de— -

pend mainly on the performances
of these two lads.

' Actually the big question mark
for the coming season is the
tackle position. This is the only
position that lost both starters,
Jim McCusker and Ron Kissel,
from the 1957 squad which won‘
four and lost six.

Ernie Westwood of Clairton,
Ken Montanari from Plum Bor-
ough, and Bill Lindner from Cen-
tral Catholic are all returning
lettermen, but Sophomores Dick
Mills of Beaver and Ed Fornadel
from Beaverdale will be ﬁghting
for a ,ﬁrst.team berth.

“Even though we have been
working an awful lot on our new
offensive patterns at Ellsworth
Center, this year’s squad will
again be a typical Panther eleven

/ in that it will be strong’ on de-

fense,” voiced Michelosen. "

Naturally much interest is
focused upon the sophomores who
will be on the team. Coaches are
to‘ praise anybody let
alone sophomores, but there are
some outstanding ones including.
Jim Cunningham, fullback from
Connellesville, Aliquippa’s end,

,Mike Ditka, and halfback Chuck

Reinhold of Mt. Lebanon.

Since this is the first year

Darling Enters
Amateur Meet;

Defends ‘ Crown

Gymnast Tom Darling will be
heading for the National AAU

Gymnastics Tournament at San
F e r n a n d 0, California, tonight.
Darling will be trying to defend
his national flying rings title.
Darling has had a very success-
ful season so far. He was unde-
feated on the rings in nine dual
meets, and defended his Eastern
and NCAA crowns on the rings
with ease. His main competition
in both events came from Penn
State’s Jay-Werner-
In retaining his NCAA title,
Darling became the ﬁrst ﬂyring-
man in the history of the Na-
tionals to ever win two suc-
cessive titles on the rings. He
—won his ﬁrst title at the Na-
tionals at Annapolis last year
and defended it at Michigan‘
_ State.

State’s Werner ﬁnished second
to Darling as a freshman in'the
AAU ﬁnals at Chicago last year.
However, Penn State gymnastics
.coach,'Gane Wettstone has not
stated as yet if Werner‘ will mak
the trip to the Coast. _ ‘ ‘

“The main reason that Darling
is able to beat Werneris that he
is always consistent and hits‘un-
der pressure. Werner is an out-
standing. gym performer for ,a
sophomore, but he, lacks consis-
tency in his routine to beat Darl-
ing,”. . commented the. Panther’s
gymnastics tutor, Warren Nieger.

“I consider Tom Darling to be
the world’s greatest flyin-gman to-
day,” said Army coach, Tom Ma-
loney, after the Easterns.

permitted to enter several addi-
tional members if they desire to
do so.

gent will be Junior Ronnie
,Schwarzel of Brentwood.
Schwarzel’s 153 score last sea-
son qualiﬁed him for the match
play championship, but he lost
out in one of the early rounds.

the trip are Seniors Dave Brown
and Bill Rielly from Brentwood
and Sharon respectively. Round-
ing ' out the squad are Juniors
Wade Hersperger, Bob Hixson,

Mike Dritz, Pat 'Rielly, William
Davidson, and Bob Bainbridge of
Penn State. Penn’s toplentry will

as ‘though Schwarzel has an ex-
cellent chance to win the title this
season,” announced Gaskill.
