W/char Repudiates
Football ‘De-emphasis’

By Leonard Levison *
Sports Editor

(See Editorial, Page 2)
“\\'e liave no intention of dc-emphasizing football. \Ve have
established a set of rules that will give us a team which will‘be able

to play football with the W'estern conference and the unoﬁicial East- ’
ern conference,” declared John ‘Weber, business manager of the Uni- -

versity, in an interview Monday.

This statenient was further in-V‘

tended to directly repudiate any
current news and editorial com-
ment in the nation’s press to the ef-
fect that the University was embark-

emphasis.

Mr. Weber was asked whether or
not his statement was basically incon-
sistent, in that under the present
manner of administering this code,
Pitt would not have the material for

a team that could cope with such ‘

formidable opponents as the Big Ten
and the Ivy League.

“For the answer to that, look at our
freshman team, one of the greatest in
years,” replied Mr. Weber.

many on campus as an indication. that
the University has “broken faith.”

Dr. Wesley Discusses Problems

In Unions’ Exclusion of Negroes

By Ruggero Aldisert

If organized labor in the United
States is to advance, it must ﬁrst
permit negroes and white men to
work side by side in the same unions,
according to Dr. Charles H.‘Wesley,
dean of the graduate school of How-
ard university.

Speaking to a capacity crowd at
last Monday’s Inquiry Forum, Dr.
Wesley pointed out “an unorganized
state of organized labor.”“ He traced
what he termed “parallel growths”
of union labor and negro freedom
from their inception to the ‘present
day.

“Today a divided front exists in
labor,” he stated. “Through dis-
against the colored
workers started in the early sixties,
unions have not placed negro and
white workers into one group.”

Dr. VVesley accused the American
Federation of Labor of refusing to
open its doors to negro labor. “Al-
though they have made wordy pro-
nouncements in favor of the negro at
every convention since 1870 their
resolutions were mere empty words.”

“The ﬁrst national union of co1—s
ored men was the American Brother- V
hood of Sleeping Car Porters. Then:
followed the Dining Car Brother-’
hood. But the AFL came along and

m .
V

created a competitive organization,
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees
group, which destroyed the brother-
hoods.”

He then revealed that the rail-
road steward, conductor, and motor-
man unions have constitution restric-
tions against the admission of negro
men. The Congress of Industrial
Organizations, he pointed out, is the
only federation thgt has permitted
the negro to join the same union as
the white man. _ ,

“We must urge the AFL to break
down its old practice of excluding
negroes,” he said, “and we must en-
courage the CIO to continue its pol-
icy of non-discriInination.”

“Labor is cutting oﬁ its nose to
spite its face. It will not succeed in
the long run if all its interest is in
one class. The inertia of the neg-
lected group will hold the entire or-
der back. ‘

“Organized labor, in the interest of
itself, not the negro, must destroy the
divided front,” he appealed.

gineers, and one on Thursday ‘
same time and in the same roo
proselyting the College and
of Business Administration.

“But none of-this is done,” ‘E.’
Hoeveler, “in animosity to‘ the
ent coalition. We realize tl
"present the fraternities are the only
Vwell-organized group on campus,
and as such their leaders can control
the political life of the University.

“It’s the system of handing out
such things as dance chairmanships,
and use of honoraries as political cap-
ital that we oppose.” The inde-
pendents feel that all such selections
should be made on the merit princi-
pal, that best man geeting the job.

“The practice » of the fraternity
caucuses of dishing out the jobs and
dances in advance to each other
leaves independents out in the cold.
In fact, a good man of the wrong
fraternity can’t get anywhere before
the appointments or executive com-
mittees.”

Another principle of the party is
that no deals will be made with other
groups. There will be no trades for
support. Consequently when the

cated on the eighth ﬂoor, would be
pplemented by a shower room, con-

The plans under discussion speci-
ed that the lounge should been-
rged and modiﬁed. A trophy room
as considered appropriate for this
ﬂoor and would ‘contain all the
trophy awards which atpresent are
“scattered all over the building.”

The changes would necessitate
moving the Owl and Panther ofﬁces

According to Bill Hoeveler, BA39,
president; and Robert Corley, assist-
ant dean of men; the dean of wo-
men’s oﬂice has already proceeded
to fomulate similar arrangements
for women.

Hoeveler led the discussion in ref-
erence to a possible clearing house
for ,commuter’s, whereby, .out-of-
town students could obtain rides
from other students who live at
home.

The advisability of creating a stu-
dent activities information booth was
also considered. This booth, ac-
cording to the plans‘ expressed by
Council members, would enable stu-
dents to ﬁnd out when and where
meetings are scheduled at any time

News to Cooperate in Nationwide
Opinion Polls of College Students

lishment of the Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America for the scientiﬁc
measurement of student thought has
been announced here with The Pitt
News as one of the cooperating col-
lege newspapers in every section of
the United States.

The News will publish the weekly
reports of the surveys giving the
opinions of all college students in the
nation on current social, political, and
economic questions. Personal inter-
viewing of students on the Univer-
sity campus and at other colleges and
universities ‘over the country begins
this week and will continue through-
out thé year.

Based on the principle of scientiﬁc
sampling that has proven highly re-
liable in other national polls in recent
years, the surveys will be the "ﬁrst
college poll that will actually cover
the entire nation in its weekly reports
of student opinion.

, The Texas Student Publications,
3.. Inc.. publishers of the Daily Texan at
l the University of Texas, are sponsors
{of the surveys in cooperation with
' almost every college daily and scores
of Weeklies in universities, teachers
colleges, normal schools, and junior
1 colleges, public and private.
The surveys have been organized
after 15 months of research in

measuring student opinion on the,

Texas campus through ‘the Texan’s
Bureau of Student Opinion. John
Martinco, C39, editor of the News,
will be local director of the poll, with
Alvin Malakoff, C40, assistant man-
aging editor, as interviewer. Joe
Belden, University of Texas senior
who has established both the Bureau
and the Surveys, will be editor of the
new poll, with Waldo Niebuhr as as-
sociate.

The project is concerned only with
disclosing facts about public senti-
ment and does not in any way seek to
inﬂuence opinion, the editors of the
surveys have announced. Pressure
groups or student movements will
have no part in the polls, and all re-
ports will be written as unbiased as
is humanly possible, it was also
stated."

With the aid of statisticians at The
University of Texas, a proportional
sample of college students has been
determined from ﬁgures supplied by
the United States Office of Education.

Ballots have been carefully dis-
tributed according to this ﬂexible
sample over a cross-section of col-
leges selected as members for the
strategic locations over the nation and
for their outstanding newspapers.
Results of local interviewing will be
mailed to Austin for tabulation. Na-
tional results will then be sent to the
newspapers.

The Panther Gets
In Print Again

HEN the new athletic policy of the University

"was announced last year, there was among
many of us a lingering hope that football was
reaching its proper perspective.

Vile considered the possibility that the Univer-

N sity was beginning an excursion from tl1e sports
‘section to the educational section in the Sunday

newspapers, and we congratulated our institution
on that possibility. -

During the past month, however, it has become
apparent that the Panther has moved not into the
education columns, but onto the front page. In-
stead of having his hair brushed back, instead of

assuming 3. digniﬁed attitude, he has become 3.

wild and unkempt animal, escaped from the cage.

The ﬁght between the freshman football squad
and the University it represents called for apolo-
gies and speeches and statements to the press. The
freshmen, who have been scrubbing Cathedral
ﬂoors and cleaning Cathedral windows in between
classes and practice, believed man-for-man that the
University was treating them to their tuition. The
University, however, ﬁgured differently.

The explanations which have come from all
sides, the petitions, the requests for investigation
instead of speechifying, have rated front page-coL
umns. The country has heard of the Panther again.

In the background hangs the Sutherland ques-
tion. The question is not whether the deeply re-
spected “ﬁrst coach in the country” is able to ‘turn
out great football teams, but whether Dr. Suther-
land, as a gentleman with great ideals and with
profound admiration of faculty and students, is
being treated like a gentleman.

“To have seen in past years, from the exodus of
Don Harrison to the tuition squabble, a series of
“incidents” which have brought the University be-
fore the public eye, and have lowered the Univer-
sity in public esteem.

To invoke any program, idealistic or realistic,
it‘ is necessary to have clarity and honesty. It. is
necessary to be plain-spoken. In an educational in-
stitution, where we seek to ﬁnd an expression of
our highest ideals, we expect to ﬁnd these virtues.

,A “university” without them is not only a mis-
nomer, but a contradiction. ,

"We who look hopefully to the University as a
means to a greater and more sincere life have trou-
-ble in facing those people who say:

“Pitt? Oh, yes. I remember reading about that
fight they ’re having. \Vhat’s it all about this

time?” 4

Music No.Longcr
,Soothes Savage Beast
H MIDST all the ponderous talk of preparations

A for war, it is refreshing to hear a familiar and
inspiring voice crying out of the wilderness.

Military men and politicians are raising the old
cry for bigger navies, more adequate air forces, and
elaborate plans for industrial and civilian con-
scription. President Roosevelt and Secretary of
«-State Hull are rushing to reaﬁirm their faith in the
paternalistic policies of the Monroe Doctrine.

But out of this atmosphere of secretive banality
a.rise the homely, “down-to-earth” sentiments of
a man of experience.

Says the irrepressible George M. Cohan in a
N. Y. Times story: “I would not be in favor of
any 1nusic_ or other emotional device for stirring up
_men and inciting them to go t'o war, but once our
course was ‘decided upon for good, I’d say, let us
have .the__ ;war songs. But simple songs, please.
Our sophisticated composers could never satisfy the
people.” ' -

‘Ne thoroughly agree with the eminent Mr.
Cohan. Sophistication has no place in a war-time
set—up.

A nation forced to the business of mass murder
has no thought for anything complicated. A sim-
ple mental state can only be maintained and inten-
siﬁed by stimulation of a simple nature. Mr.
‘Cohan, a man of great practical experience both in
and out of the music business, should know.

\Ve were beginning to be bored by all the un-
original prophesies of an impending conﬁict. But
_Mr. Cohan’s proclamation makes us look forward
"to M-day with renewed interest.

Carnevale also paints the completed ﬁg-

Costumes are designed by Dorothy Goldsmith and‘
‘ Pearl Levine, and Erle H. Hill creates the scenic back-

grounds. Professional in every aspect,ithis group in my
estimation, is foremost in artistry and appeal.

“Hansel and Gretel” is to be presented the middle
of December. Shirley Temple and Freddie Bartholo-
mew are to be caricatured as Hansel and Gretel, while
Slim Summerville and Edna Mae Oliver will be satir-
ized as their father and mother.

With the ability and enthusiasm that they have al-
ready displayed, this cooperative group should become
an established center for discriminating college students.

PrintExhibit Opens
On Seventh Floor  

. By J olm Brosky‘

An outstanding exhibition of paintings by 50 Ameri-
can artists of all ages, regions, and schools was opened
to the student body last Monday‘ at the department of
ﬁne arts, seventh ﬂoor, Cathedral.

The exhibit, entitled “5O American Prints,” is being
circulated by the American Institute of Graphic Arts.
It features paintings, etchings, and wood-cuts by fore-
most artists during 1933 and 1938 and it is to be current
here until December. 10.

Supplementing the display are sculptures of 12 of
these contemporary artists by Isabella Howland. Sculp-
tured heads include Kuniyoshi, Carl Waters, Ganso,
Karﬁol, George O’Keefe and Isabella Howland.

Amongithe group of paintings are the new efforts of
Thomas Benton, John Curry, and Grant Wood,_whose
works are best known to the man in the street.

In place of introspective abstraction, these three and
other American artists painted what they saw in their
own land—streets, ﬁelds, shipyards, and people who
lived in such places. Benton exempliﬁed Missouri;
Curry depicted Kansas; and Wood landscaped Iowa.

“The Jealous Lover Of Lone Green Valley” and “Cot-
ton Town” typify the inspiration and interest Benton
ﬁnds in subjects of his native land.

Wood won great acclaim in 1934 for his painting
“Dinner For Threshers” which was voted third most
popular by the public when it was on display at the
Carnegie International. Curry’s fame rests on his work
“Tornado.”

Other paintings are by Kuniyoshi, Albright, Peggy
Bacon, Corbino, Gropper, Rockwell Kent, Doris Lee, and
Reginald Marsh. I

It isn’t true what they say about Dixie . . . if it were, we have :10

qualms in saying that the story

of the meeting between Pitt and

Duke would have been in an altogether di-ﬂ"ferent tempo . . . popular
dittics and et"I'er«tive propawanda l1-ad us thml-zing that the sun always

shines in the southland . . . don ’t believe it .

All day long Friday the sun

was shining and the turf in the Duke
tadium was sure and springy . . .
all Friday night you could haV€
counted each star in the sky . .
that is, if you could count Friday
night . . . Saturday morning was
clear and cold at 12130 the
busses with the Panther footballers
pulled away from the Carolina Inn in
-Chapel Hill . . . three miles out

among the Carolina pines, the Pitt
football team ran smack into the
blizzard . . when they were ready
to run out into the Stadium at ﬁve
minutes to two, all that could be
seen of the gridiron grass were the
tracks that Pitt’s sleepless band had

made . ﬁve minutes later even
these were gone . it was a white
Thanksgiving . . .

Somehow this loss wasn’t so hard

to take . . sometimes the best man
doesn’t win that’s what this
was mentally and physically

the Panthers were set to win this one

and they played as good a
game as they played all year . . .
in every way, except the kicking,
they were the better bunch of foot-
ball players . . that’s why they are
saying now that the Blue Devils are
the ﬁrst team to get kicked into the
Rose Bowl . . .

Goldberg went through the center
of those “seven iron Dukes” with
more alacrity than a bobsled . . .
the only thing that could really stop
him was the snow . . which proves
he isn’t really a bobsled . two
times Goldberg was away into the
open from which point he is never
stopped . . only to slip in the snow
. Cassiano and Stebbins, who
are always good for at least three
good runs apiece, couldn’t do any-
thing . . because when they start-
ed wide they went alright, but when
the time came for the pivot in
through the tackle or out around the
end, they were ﬁnished . . . the
ground was unpivotable . . .

Much has been written about the

been touched upon was the tremend-

because of this reason that Cassiano

run them back .

Varsity Letter Clubs

Statement to

E'rito7"s Note—-Chancellor Bowmane

refused this suggestion that a com-
7ni.ttee be appointed to investigate
the whole matter.

November 17, 1938.
“Mr. Chancellor:

“We are a committee delegated
by the Varsity Letter Club of the
University to have a friendly talk
with you about the athletic prob-
lem. We want to say at the out-
set that we are here with a good
will for you, and we are not here
to condemn or «_to' criticise unfair-
ly. We want you to know that,
although we have been proud of
the ﬁne athletic tradition of the
University we are also proud of
the accomplishments of our school
in our other directions—proud of
the things you have done in your
administration.

“The Varsity Letter Club is an
organization of more than 900 men
who have won their letters in all
varsity sports. ‘We feel that we
are in a real sense the keeper of
the great tradition here at Pitt and
that we have every right to try to
preserve and maintain that tradi-
tion. We don’t have to tell you
that in recent -years our athletics
have been in a terrible muddle—
one embarrassing episode after
another has discredited the Uni-
versity and its athletics, and we
say sincerely, Dr. Bowman, that
we letter men have had to hang"
our heads in shame.

“We feel strongly that the whole
athletic problem has been badly
mismmanaged, and that the per-
sons to whom yau have given re-
sponsibility have been guilty of
many inexcusable blunders—terri-
ble errors.

In Sympathy Evith Code

“We assure you that we are not
opposed in principle to the new
code for athletics. We are just as
interested as you are in having
good scholarship and a high type
of boy representing Pitt in ath-
letics. We want our athletes to be
‘a credit to the institution. But we
feel that the whole inference of
developments has been to reﬁect
badly on us and on the other letter
man who were part of a system_
vrhich we feel was perfectly all
right in its time and place.

“In the past two years. athletic
:‘F’ai1‘s have been so badly bung-
led and the resulting publicity has
been so vicious that the University
of Pittsburgh has become the most
shamefully maligned institution
in the country.

Cittmceiior

“These blunders have injured
the prestige, not only of our ath-
letics, but of the University itself.
They have disturbed the conﬁdence
of students, alumni, and the pub-
lie. The motives of the University
are being questioned. The morale
of the University has been shaken..

“Those in charge of athletics
are being held responsible for the‘
tragic errors which have brought
discredit to the institution, starting
with the Rose Bowl affair two years
ago. We cannot understand how ;
even ordinary horse sense would
permit such mistakes, and we feel
that the vincompetency of those in
charge of athletics has been clearly
demonstrated.

Integrity Under Suspicion

“The latest incident involving
the freshmen is particularly. bad
because suspicion has been cast "on.
the integrity of the University.
We have made sufficient investiga-
tion of the facts to convince us that
the freshmen athletes L were
brought here on certain promises
of University olﬁcials, and these
promises have not been fulﬁlled.
There is evidence that University
ofﬁcials have broken faith.

“The tragedy of the latest ﬁasco
is that a University, which is one
institution in all the world where
honesty, frankness and courage are
expected, and where idealism is
instilled in youth by precept and
example—that a university should
be charged with fraud and dishon-
esty.

“Mr. Chancellor we feel so
strongly about this that We are
prepared to furnish capable advice

that they may be
sented.

“We like you, Dr. Bowman. We
believe you are sincere. We want
to help you. But we ask you, for
God’s sake, take hold of this mess
and clean it up. .Set our athletic
house in order.

“The situation is so acute that
this committee recommends that
you approve a competent, impar-
tial and representative committee
to make a thorough investigation
of the whole problem.

liar] Cra\_vford, president of the

General Alumni Association of the
University, last Monday evening
named a committee of seven mem-
bcrs to investigate the athletic situa-
tion at the University which was
brought to the foreground recently
by the freshmen football players’ dis-
satisfaction with tuition arrange-
ments. ‘
3 The committee met last night in
private session at the Hotel Schen-
ley to determine their method of pro-
cedure. The members are Ira R.
Hill, LL7; Herbert N. Riley, C12; Dr.
Bernice Storey, Edl9; John B. Nick-
las, Jr., L22; Dr. Robert LaRue,
D37; Harold Downing, C15; and U1-
hard Hangartner, BA26.

At the time of his announcement
of the committee members, Crawford
also issued the following statement:

“As authorized by the unanimous
consent of the Alumni Council on
November 21, I have appointed a
committee to investigate the whole
athletic problem oi‘ the University
of. Pittsburgh and, further, to in-.
vestigate the basic reasons for the
unfavorable publicity which the.
University has received in recent.
years. '

A “The committees job is unques-
tionably difficult and complex,

the ability of the members to do
an objective, thorough and ef-
fective piece of work.

New Party Formed

payty is successful there will be no
need for patronage.

Hoevelcr disclaims any connection
with the old independent group.
“Last year’s split in the party .
marke-:1 the end of the old group. We :
want nothing to do with the old par- ,
ty. It fell when the fraternity men ’
talked those who went into the coal- ’
ition into doing so. :

“The fraternity party campaign
managers of last year, Barr and ;
Ham’burg,,convinced many of the
candidates that the best interests of
both groups would be served if they
combined and went in as a unit.

Then they would contol the execu-
tive eommittee and the faculty would
no longer cast the deciding votes as
happened when the committee was
split between fraternities and inde-
pendents.”

The aim of the party is to obtain a
loyal membership of about 1,000
members who will be split at elec-
tion time and instructed to vote for,
21 particular slate. By next spring
its leaders hope that there will be
adequate backing for three tickets
with about 400 votes per ticket.
