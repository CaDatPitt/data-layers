‘ ‘Three Seek BAS Post

In Election Wednesday

BY BILL MOORE

Three candidates will seek the
Black Action Society (BAS) chair-
manship in Wednesday's election,
and a fourth is unopposed for the
ofﬁce of co-chairman.

Lorenzo Boone. Kevin Cooper
and Bill Warren are actively
campaigning for the organization’s
top position.

ﬂu Doug Guy was the only student

"'“'io ﬁle a petition for the co-chair-
manship.

The elections will be held
Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
in the Towers and from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. in the Student Union. Only
those students registered with BAS
are eligible to cast ballots, and

registration will remain open until
tomorrow.

Boone has listed increasing
student involvement in BAS as his
main objective. “Naturally, the
main thing is unification,” he said.
“I feel that many of the problems
we are confronted with must be
solved through uniﬁcation of black
organizations on campus. Out of
this will come strength.”

Boone’s campaign theme is
utilization of resources, he said.
“The most important resource is
ourselves. If we can deal 'with
ourselves, we can alleviate a lot of
our problems.

“I am a strong follower of Rev.
Martin Luther King,” Boone

Union Election Picture:

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

With the outcome of the
Provost's area faculty union elec-
tion still hanging on 64 challenged
ballots, a clearer picture is
emerging of the tactical situation
faced by the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU), which perhaps faces
a March 30 and 31 runoff against
the “No Representative” option.

V The American Association of
University Professors (AAUP)
could need only 12 of the

, yllenged ballots to push past the

U and become runnerup. Just
how many of the contested votes
actually will be allowed to count
toward the ﬁnal tally will not be
known until a ruling is made at a
meeting this week.

NEWS ANALYSIS

If, after the election contests are
decided, the PPU still tops the
AAUP and gains the runnerup slot,
the need for forming a solid
pro-union voting bloc would be-
come important. The pro-union
vote total amounts to 782, versus
the 554 “No Representative”
votes; therefore, a uniﬁed drive by
all union voters could carry the

G; rovost’s area.
‘.

PPU President Van Beck Hall
already has stated his organization
will propose a “troika" arrange-
ment with the AAUP and the
Pennsylvania State Education-
Association (PSEA) in which the
other unions will maintain their
organization integrity and bargain
through a mutual caucus.

There may be substantial road-
blocks, however. The AAUP
membership voted unanimously
last summer to oppose a proposed
merger with the PPU.

The PSEA, affiliated» with a
national association, is restricted

.,by national policy from forming

 mbinations with unions afﬁliated
 7with the «American Federation of

Teachers (AFT). The PPU is an
V affdiate of the AFT ' L

 
  

gll Not Said and Done

What could‘ remove these two
apparent obstacles, however, is the
possibility that some AAUP mem-
bers would vote union regardless of
an organizational stand. Also, the
PSEA could either ignore national
policy (as some union locals have
done on campuses around the
country) or encourage its members
to vote PPU as individuals.

Another plus seems to be the
PPU’s organizational skills, which
some suggested after last Thurs-
day’s count was the real force
behind the union’s victory margin
in the Provost's area.

Faculty perceptions of the PPU
will become even more important if

Tower C Raids

FedsArrest 2in D

BY BILL MOORE

Two Pitt students were arrested
Friday in Tower C by three federal
narcotics agents and charged with
selling and delivering dangerous
drugs. One of the agents allegedly
was struck with a bottle during the
arrest.

One of the students, a graduate
teaching fellow in the chemistry
department, previously served one
-year in federal prison following a
conviction in 1973 for manufactur-
ing amphetamine sulphate in the
laboratory of Waynesburg Central
High where he worked as a
chemistry teacher.

According to a witness to
Friday’s arrests, the grad student
and a female companion were in
her dorm room when one of the
plainclothes agents came to the

door and demanded entry.
After the woman agreed to let
him in, the witness said, two other
agents joined the first and
“rushed” the door. In an attempt

_ to gain entry one of the agents was
' struck with the bottle and knocked’

back into the hallway, the witness
said._

The two students then closed the
door and refused to come out until
some time later when campus
police were called, the witness
said. ‘

According to police, the federal .
task force agent was taken to
Presbyterian Hospital where he
was treated and released.

Federal agents said the grad
student had been manufacturing
methaqualude somewhere in the
University, and charged the two
with selling ﬁve pounds of the

Students Protest Prof's Ouster

BY CONNIE GIEL

Nearly 50 students protesting the

alleged ﬁring of a Pitt sociology I

professor converged on the ofﬁce of
the department chairman Friday to
demand the department’s steering
committee overturn its decision.

Dr. Paul Nyden was told
Thursday b'y department chairman
Dr. Burkert Holzner that the
steering committee had recom-
mended confidentially that his
academic appointment not be
renewed. A _

Nyden charged in an open letter
to Holzner that there is a political
atmosphere preventing an objec-
tive decision within the depart-
ment, specifically within the
three-man steering committee.

One member of the committee-
professor Roland Robertson—was
singled out by Nyden as harboring
criticisms of Nyden’s classroom
work in Marxist studies. ‘

pl-Iolzner insisted Nyden had not
been “ﬁred,” since the steering
committee'_s r

  

rt asmerely one. appepapl, N _ _ ,

   

stage in a process of review to be
continued by the senior faculty and
the dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. »

Students joined Nyden in calling
for an immediate faculty meeting,
with student as observers or
participants.

“We are customers and consum-
ers of the University,” one student
said, “and we should have the
right to review the product.”

Holzner said a meeting is slated
for Friday, but that a forum like
that demanded by the students
would have to be considered ﬁrst
by senior faculty members within
the department. Students claimed,
however, the meeting had been
cancelled and not rescheduled.

Students plan to meet tomorrow
at 10 a.m. in 102 Mervis Hall,
Holzner’s office, to reiterate their
demands.

Nyden said he would release an
informal statement today to clarify .
his arguments and begin an

agent. i .

Pitt ofﬁcials did not denythe
possibility the drugs were manu-.
factured here, but said as of
Saturday they knew of no deﬁnite
proof that this had occurred. ",

The University was apparently.
aware of the 31-year-old grad
student’s previous conviction but
believed him rehabilitated, a
spokesman said. ’

The female student was released
on $2,000 bond following the
arrest, while the graduate student
was held in Allegheny County Jail
in lieu of $5,000 bond. A hearing
will be held for the two on March
19. 1’

Federal drug agents said the‘
drugs allegedly sold them were
worth.$1,500. I

CAS Rejects

Plus/Minus

Grade Plan .

A proposal to allow an instructor
to add plus and minus marks to
grades in CAS was rejected Friday
by the CAS Council.

The debate centered on fears by
student representatives that incon-
sistencies would arise should the
new system be made optional.
Questions were raised about how
the quality point value of the new
grades would be assigned.

Several council members pointed
out the proposed grading‘ structure

arbitrarily makes a plus or minus

worth one-fourth a quality point
instead of one-third for example.

an A-minus would equal 3.75 V

instead of 3.67.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall
explained the system as stated in
the proposal

 

 

was already pro- ,
V gramined in the Uni_versit_v's p
computer. and any effort to revise

- T the system wduld be a difficult'one_. R '

Union Election Picture Clearer

(Continued from Page 1)
that organization finds itself in the

‘/{:.».runoff against “No Representa-

tive.” While some see the PPU as
politically more “radical” than the
AAUP, the fact the PPU is seen
also as strongly Pitt-oriented may
ake it more “centrist” than the
PSE-A—for instance, in terms of
academics.

Another important factor will be.

the tactics used by the Teachers for
an Independent Faculty (TIF), an
organization of “people who don’t

like to join organizations," accord-
ing to one member, and that
coalesced as the anti-union organi-
zation on campus in the months
prior to last week's union vote.
The TIF currently runs on a
shoestring budget, compared to the
more comprehensive campaigns of
the union organizations. Whether

the TIF will continue or step up its_

anti-union campaign also will have
an effect on ‘the PPU’s chances for
winning the runoff.

Just how the runoff will go will

be determined not only by the
TIF's activity, but also by the
activity of the AAUP's and PSEA’s
membership. ~

In general, the appetite of all
sides for making predictions seems
to have cooled after‘ Thursday's
ballot count, and most will sit down
and wait for the outcome critical of
rulings on the 64 challenged, ballots
that may have the explosive
potential of changing the unioniza-
tion story at Pitt yet one more time.

 SCATH’sMainstream 

The recent assessments by members of the Student Government
Board concerning the rhetoric surrounding the operation of the Student -

A A Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH) will have value only if the

Board can generate greater participation in the group by the

iminstream of Pitt students.

SCATH meetings have been attended steadily by representatives of
the Board, the Greeks, the residents, the cormnuters and the Black
Action Society. But the number of constituents of these groups .
attending SCATH discussions has been terribly small.

It makes little sense to complain about SCATH’s tactics and direction
if there aren’t enough votes at the meetings to institute a proper

strategy.

But regardless of whether there, is a great inﬂux of students at the
next meeting, there are a few things SCATH can be doing-in the L

. I

First, the core of students who began the coalition must be open to
shifting direction and even leadership if the majority of those on hand ,

seeﬁt.

Second, the actions of the SCATH committees must be cleared with

I and held accountable to the general SCATH voting body. This would
. ‘ prevent the railroading of proposals that would reﬂect poorly on the
V coalition’4s-competence.

Third, and perhaps most important, SCATH’s steering committee
must be comprised of the same leaders whose varying interests will
‘provide balance and a moderate course for the coalition to follow.

Since SCATH’s inception,

therehasbeena

crossﬁre of

words-—'student against student, debating what the exact makeup of
the coalition should be. Instead of directing their energies at the
administration or the state legislature, students—-and this includes
us—have wasted them on each other.
It’s time for a verbal cease-ﬁre and a serious initiation of ,a planning
stage of SCATH—to be undertaken by a more diverse core of

policymakers.

The coalition ’s objective

Contrary to the impression given
by The Pitt News article “SGB

A Accused SCATH Of Too Much

Rhetoric,” the Student Coalition
Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH) is
for the first time coalescing as a

united group. While Student’

Government President Barry

‘ Weisband has criticized SCATH as

being too rhetorical, his general

A tone at the last SCATH meeting

was one of willingness to involve
further the Student Government
Board (SGB) within the day‘ to day
affairs of SCATH rather than take

v potshots from the sidelines. This

pleased the small number of active
SCATH members, who have felt it
was unfair for SCATH members to
criticize them without bothering to
get involved.

From the beginning, all commit-
tees of SCATH have been open to
any student, yet it was a small
number of students who hammered
out the SCATH Statement of
Purpose. Reflected in the State-
ment was a certain style and
rhetorica_l.form, which is usual for
statements of this type. The Pitt
News, which has endorsed SCATH,
considered the Statement of

'Purpose important enough to

criticize (with its own form of
rhetoric) in the same issue.

' The Pitt News subsequently
'printed the statement as a letter to
the editor.

The Pitt News also failed to point
out that if students do not like the
direction SCATH is taking. but are
concerned about paying more
tuition next year. they have the
option of going to the committee
meetings and/or general meetings
of SCATH and changing things
withinﬁa democratic structure.

One of the demands of SCATH is
to see the Level One budget. If the
money Chancellor Posvar has
asked for from Harrisburg does not
arrive he will either raise tuitions,
reduce educational programs. or do
some _combination of both. SCATH
believes there is a third alternative
which Posvar could take. which is

 

  
 

to ,_.~cut_ba.ck administrative spend- . - .s_oC_ieeety_

ing. But they have been unable to
specify what spending because up
till this point SCATH has been
unable to scrutinize the Level One
budget. Most of SCATH are
pleased that Weisband, who is also
in SCATH, will be able to see the

budget, but some _wonder whether‘

he-will be able to spot the areas of
spending which SCATH might
criticize, considering the size and
complexity of the budget. This is a
task which might take “experts”
many hours.

A core of activists in SCATH at I

this point have manged to staff an
office daily, in A509 Schenley,
organize a petition drive, publicize
SCATH meetings and plan Wed-
nesday’s teach-in. Also scheduled
are educational picket lines Mon-
day, Tuesday and Wednesday at
noon on‘ the Cathedral lawn.

0n the road to Bethlehem

The Story YouNever Heard

BY W.'JACK ROMBERG

There is a question on the lips
of millions of Americans worried
about the naticn’s morality: Is God
dead, missing, or merely taking a
extended coffee break? '

Listening to the rantings of
theology and biology students and
of those who want prayer in‘ public
schools will not help us find God.

Instead we must take a careful look «

at history‘ to see at what point God
actually disappeared, and then
deduce the reasons why.

  e Toward United Consumers

Whether or not students spend
more money in 'tuition may be
directly related to the number of
students who turn out at these
events. This is a visible way, of
putting‘ pressureon the adminis-
tration, demonstrating the degree
to which students are concerned.
Fifteen to twenty .activists will not
stop a tuition hike or satisfy any of
the other goals of SCATH—only a
united mass of students can have

,any impact.

Within the University, students
and the administration are in an
adversary relationship, the admin-
istration sells education and the
student buys education. Only as
united consumers will the voices of
students be heard by the adminis-
tration.

Editor’s ‘note: Cliarles»Og_g is a
member of SCATH.

lfihe Nyden Case  

Two hundred years ago our
forefathers’ visionary treatment of
government created an atmosphere
that provided for a reasonable
combination of authority and
autonomy. Such an atmosphere
permitted this society to maximize
its own utility. Throughout the
years. however, that optimal mix
eroded into an imperfect balance
between authority and autonomy.
The abrupt and unjust dismissal of
Dr. Paul Nyden is a gross
illustration of such an imperfect
balance. ‘ ~

As a matter of fact. what is
astonishing is not that an organi-
zing campaign by labor has come
so late (better late than never). but
that frankly authoritarian» heirar-
chical arrangements at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh should still be
surviving on so widespread a scale
in our supposedly open and-free

       
 

  
   

For a society to operate openly
and freely. it must necessarily rest
on at least five principles:
participation, equal rights and
opportunities, the right of dissent,
due process, and an unquestion-
able right to accurate and complete
information on all matters pertain-
‘ing to one's own welfare. "The
decision to dismiss Nyden is a
blatent violation of these riecessary
principles.

Moreover. the dangers of abrupt
and arbitrary employment deci-
sions and the lack of any appeal
again those decisions are all factors
which are in obvious and direct
conflict with the stated values of
our society.

. a few days.

Recent revelations have made it
possible togpresent here, in toto,
the greatest story never told.

It begins almost 2,000 yearsago,
with two people sitting on their. ass
on the way to Bethlehem. One
night they were a nice, up-and-
coming _Jewish couple. The next,
they were the participants in. a
marital squabble that changed
history. '

It seems the wife got up one
morning and announced she was
pregnant. This in itself was not so
surprising, but she also announced
she would be ready to give birth in
This shocked the

husband, who began to suspect
’shenanigans on the part of his
allegedly virginal wife.

It’ was only later, through his
wife's admission, that the husband
discovered his rival was God.

“Now I know why‘ you were
‘saving’ yourself. for all these
years,” lamented the husband.

“Look at the bright side, dear,”
replied the wife. “How many men
do you know have a wife who is 32
and never been kissed.”

“That’s just the problem,”
moaned the husband.

Soon he came heavily under the

inﬂuence of the grape. His lot
was sorry indeed and it only

worsened as the child~his wife bore ,

grew older and began proclaiming
himself the son of God.

Finally a wiseman befriended
the husband and convinced him the
only way to get justice was to take
the matter to court. So the
husband hired one of the ﬁnest
Jerusalem lawyers and brought
suit against God. 

A preliminary hearing was called
and a panel of judges was selected

to determine the validity of the .

husband’s claim.

“Exactly what is it that disturbs
you the most about the situation?”
asked one of the judges.

“Never having seen my ~rival,”
answered the husband. _



“Well, shouldn’t that make it
easier for you?”

“Your honor, my wife has never
seenethis guy, either. Can you
imagine losing your wife 
someone neither of you has seen
He .sent a messenger to get her‘
pregnant. I have the right to
confront this fellow face to face and
ask him why he had to pick on my
wife.” ‘

Soon a subpoena was sent to God

requesting he appear before the

judge. God refused to appear, and
a sheriff’s posse was sent out to
haul him in. This was when God
disappeared.

Soon, sacriﬁces no longer were
being accepted, prophets ceased
their appearances and the rate of
reported miracles declined by 99% .

There was no trace of God in’t%._V'

part, of the world.

The_only sign of God since then
came in 1492, when Christopher
Columbus unexpectedly discovered
the _ New World. There were
reports that God was on board the-
Santa Maria disguised as an Italian
sailor. Rumor has it that God
created the New World ' so
Columbus would not sail over the
edge of the planet and make a fool

of himself.

Further, by creating the New
World, God gave himself vast
spaces within which he could
disappear. _

So where is God? For those ‘_~;..
have been anxiously awaiting an
answer, he reputedly isiliving in
Salingeresque seclusion in Hac-
kensack, N.J. There have been
various attempts to draw him
out—burnt offerings and revival
meetings for example—but he
seems to prefer retirement.

Whether God will ever choose to
make his presence felt in the world
one can never say. But one also
can't help feeling ‘a little sympathy
for the desperate husband who
went to his grave with nothing but
a broken marriage, a delayed trial
and a stack of lawyer’s bills.

him. “I not only know what is

Open for Spring Term

BY STEVE SYBERT

Applications for positions on the
Residence Hall and Campus
Judicial boards are being taken for
spring and summer sessions
according to Alden Bowen, coor-
dinator of the University Student
Judicial System.

Students must submit applica-
tions to 105 S.U. by 5 p.m. March
26. Applicants will be evaluated on
their ability, maturity and interest
in fellow students. No certain grade
field of study is
required.

Board members are expected to

' reason through the problems they

will face and come to logical
conclusions, sometimes responsi-
ble for determining the fate of
other students.

“I think the opportunity for
students to do this is important
both to the students and the
University,” Bowen said. “It
allows the students to have a say in
what is appropriate and inappro-
priate on this campus.”

The Residence ' Hall A Judicial

Board position is open to all
graduates and undergraduates who

will be living in the dorms during,

the spring or summer. It is limited
to judicating minor offenses that
take place within the residence
halls.

All major offenses, including
those within the residence halls,

are judicated by the Campus

Judicial Board, which has juris-
diction over all students allegedly
in violation of the Student Code of
Conduct. These positions are open
to all full-or part-time graduate and
undergraduate students attending
the spring or summer sessions.
Theboards will met one evening
per week at 6 p.m. for a few hours
and according to Bowen, will

The Evolution of a Civilization

lNew Undergraduate Course Next Fall
Professor Murdo MacLeod

 

A course especially designed to acquaint undergraduates with Latin
America, the region closest to the United States, with which we have

signiﬁcant historical, economic and political ties. Professor MacLeod will
review the evolution ‘of ‘Latin . American civilization from pre-
Colmnbian times to the present, including race relations, Hispanic
American imperialism, the rise of populist parties, monocultural
dependence, the revolutions of Mexico and Cuba, and the conservative

response of Brazil and Chile. 1 ‘ »

3'-x.

BY M.C. PILECKI

And now for something com-
pletely different in a movie:

Boy meets girl.

Don’t laugh. It's one of the more
unusual premises for a ﬂick in
recent years. We’ve had boy meets

shark, boy meets gun (lots of,

those), and inﬁnite variations on
boy meets boy. But Heterosexual
relationships seem to belong to the

 . past.

There has been such a chronic
shortage of roles for women lately
that the suggestion has been made
that actresses should be on the
endangered species list. There
have even been wags putting forth
the notion that soon the Best
Actress Award will go the way of
the ‘Best Black and White Cinema-'
tography Award. '

vlf you think all this is exagger-
ated, just go over the movies of the
past few years that have dominated
the “Oscar” lists. Now try to list
10—top, working ﬁlm

will be hard enough just ﬁnding 10
working actresses.

Thus-I it’s a real joy to see a
woman on screen again.

Gable and Lombard is not the
greatest movie ever made. But it’s

the kind of ﬁlm“ one wishes would

happen more often. The plot is
simple—a fairly hokey love story
(ouch) told humorously. And as if

7 - you couldn't tell, the two people

- .. involved are the late screen stars,
W the racy duo Clark Gable and
p Carole Lombard.

The ﬂick is not so bad as one

might think from the publicity. The

main credit for that goes to Jill
' gh (Lombard), who domi-
e ﬁlm throughout and gives

  

. down,

it more life than the script often
deserves. Her feisty Lombard is a
complex woman with a healthy
share of passions and ﬁght.

Her seemingly boundless energy
and spirit overwhelms James
Brolin’s Gable. ‘His “King” is a
fairly insipid character, and it’s
difﬁcult to see what a woman like
Lombard could possibly see in him.
True, much of the problem lies with
Brolin. His approach to the role is
more a stylized impersonation than

I a» portrayal.

Oh yes, he has the voice patterns
and even some of the
mannerisms. And t_here is (with the
help of makeup) an amazing
physical resemblance. But there's
nothing behind it. Brolin’s dull, flat
Gable falls short of the original ’30s
screen) idol and ‘more than
anything, a straight man to play off
Clayburgh’s Lombard.

Fortunately for the ﬁlm—and the
audiencg Clayburgh more than
compensates for Brolin’s inadequa-
cies. She even makes the script’s
constant reference to Gable as
“that big ape” sound alot less silly
than it is. Her triumphant scene in
the courtroom to “save her man”
stands as the highlight of the entire
ﬁlm.

In case anyone doesn’t know the
story, Gable was absolutely the
hottest male property to hit the
silver screen, and there was as
much interest in his off-screen
romances as there was curiousity
about his actions on-screen. As
legend has it, even though /he was
married several times, the one
woman he truly loved was popular
comedienne' Carole Lombard. Per-
haps their love never had the
chance to sour for Lombard died in
a 1942 plane crash while on a war

  Most employers think
‘   twice about hiring

people with
criminal records.

  Phone fraud will result
in a criminal record.

Think twice.

I r ® Bell of Pennsylvania

Gable and Lombard, portrayed by
James Brolin and Jill Clayburgh,
on an outing.

bond-selling trip.

This latest ﬁlm centers on their
long clandestine love affair, while
Gable was still married to his

,second wife. Considering modern

permissiveness, it may seem
difﬁcult to realize that adultery was
enough to ‘wreck both of their
careers, but the restrictiveness of
the ’30s cinema did not bend even
for this famed couple.

Hollywood has always gone in for
dredging up its own history for
movie fodder, particularly recently

(with the fetish for nostalgia. But

Gable and Lombard has to be
counted as one of the better ones,
not only as a retelling of a
Hollywood story, but more in a
successfully evoking the atmos-
phere of the “Golden Age.”

Bowie Past

,/

BY TOM WASELESKI

There are rock shows, and then
there are rock performances: David
Bowie’s return to the Civic Arena
Thursday night marked a return to

the audience mania of another
era.

From his emergence into the
ﬂoodlights to his ﬁnal’ bow, the
deafening crowd responded to the
performer’s every move. His tight
pelvic swivel, his full-toothed grin
and his arm extended to those
trying to climb on ‘stage exempli-
ﬁed a different Bowie.

We had seen the new Bowie in
magazines and on his more recent
album covers, or rather another)
face of him, typiﬁed in his new
disco direction. No longer the
queen—the punk no more. Here
was a star, one who had been
through those “ch-ch-ch-ch-chan-
ges,” as he sang it, becoming a
demigod, at least on the musical
altar. « .

His band opened with the title
cut from’ his most recent LP,
Station to Station, with its long
instrumental intro before Bowie
came onstage. The lights on the
players ‘brightened and before
Bowie was in sight there was a
mad rush to the retaining wall that
had been erected about eight feet
from the foot of the stage. They
knew this wasthe point where the
vocal began, and sure enough, out
stepped Bowie, amid a roar that
drowned 64 speakers.

Bowie, the pallid, corpse-gray
complexion. Bowie, silver-haired
forehead blending into auborn at
the back. Bowie, black pants and
vest over a white shirt.

His voice was in top shape. His

band, unlike the typical concert
band, was a well-oiled machine.
Together they banged out four of

the six cuts from the newalbum, 5,‘
keeping them as tight as the -I. '
polished studio version and adding
the ﬁerce energy that comes with a

live performance.

Station to -Station might have
been the night’s best number,
which featured Tony Kaye, Yes’s
pre-Rick Wakeman keyboard artist,
switching between electric piano
and synthesizer.

The only comprised tune was
“TVC15,” also from the new
album, which Bowie introduced.
“This is a love story between a _
television receiver and a girl.”

So, after telling us about the
song, he showed us what he could
make of it in a live performance,
distoring the driving power of the 9,;r..1
chor_us with an over-mellow backup "
Vocal. E

There were no other blunders-
the rest of the show whizzed by
ﬂawlessly. From an unforgettable
drum solo by Dennis Davis that
activated stagelights, to the tough
guitar work by Stacy Heydon and
Carlos Alomar, this band'could’ve
done a show without their head
honcho and succeeded grandly.

Throughout many of -the tunes it
was dramatically evident that those
album outs whose backup vocals ‘
sound like Bowie re-tracked are not
Bowie at all, but members of his,gfV<_,
band who can mimic his voice to a T ”
tee. This was particularly in
evidence at the tail end of “Fame,”
when it. sounds like Bowie being
tracked numerous times to repeat
“Fame, fame, fame, fame, etc.,”
over several torturous ~octaves,
high to low. Those at the concert
know this little feat is actually a
three-man job.

Except for a few conspicuous
absences, notably his latest,
“Golden Years," “Young Ameri-
cans” and the thing that started it
all in this country, “Space
Oddity,” Bowie and the band did
all the biggies.

...

As an encore, he took on “Rebel, T a”
Rebel” and “Jean Genie,” while
the crowd danced and yelled. At
the end, Bowie finaled with
repeated bows to the wild clapping
of his audience. —

Then to the wildly clapping
hands held high above every head,
the new Bowie, his vest now off,
exited with repeated bows.

ATTITUDE TEST PLAN NED.

HERSHEY, Pa. (AP)—The ini-
tial step has been taken to make
voluntary a state test that measures
children’s attitudes toward par-
ents, teachers and fellow pupils.

But under the plan, the contro-
versial Educational Quality Assess-
ment Test would only be optional
for 1976-77. Starting in September
1977, the test would become
mandatory as it has been the past
three years.

Critics contend the test seeks to
make children conform to the
state’s idea of what children should
be like.

The test asks such things as
whether they enjoy school, like
their teachers, get along with
pupils of different races and
religions, would smoke marijuana
and drink beer if-their peers did the
same and what they thought of,
themselves.

The test results go to the school .-
districts, which are supposed to use
the information to correct weak-
nesses in their programs. _
