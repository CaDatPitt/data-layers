‘Future of Land Next
To Law3cliool Unsure

byROBOBENREDER‘

The future of the property ad-
jacent to the new law school site
on Forbes Ave. is uncertain. The
property. bounded by Forbes.
Bouquet, Oakland, and Sennott.
was acquired by the General State
Authority (GSA) in 1969-70 for
‘use by the University. The build-
ings on the block presently house
Brother Georges, Gil’s, and a
parking lot located behind them.

Hunt V. Martin, Director of the
Physical Plant, said. “There has
been no determination of what is

is to be done with the property."
Oakland Development Inc. (ODI ).
a community group concerned
with the future of the Oakland
neighborhood, are opposing the
construction of a University facil-
ity on the land.‘

“This rulesout the use of the

7 Great Expectations

property.. Other possibilities in-

clude a sealed bid auction of the

property by the GSA and return-
ing the property to the former
owners at the same price, paid for
it. The latter action is not feasible
because the GSA would have to
pay the transaction costs, and as
a result could be charged with
misuse of public funds.”

"The land was acquired through
eminent domain rulings. requiring
it to be used for education-related
services. The University and ODI
are in the process of drawing up
a list of the possible uses of the
land."

A Martin alsomentioned the pos-
sibility ofrenovating the existing
buildings on the block. For this to,
be feasible. however. the Univer-
sity must be able to use the build-
ings for five years.

Moye Discusses Past Year

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

"Our basic philosophy is that

V we exist to serve students: we

" want to facilitate the solving of

student problems; we will articu-

. late the students‘ needs to ‘the

administration; but. of ‘course.

this is dependent upon student de-

sires to have these needs ex-

pressed.“ said Alfred Moye. Dean

of Student Affairs, during a re-
cent interview.

Moye. who has just completed
one year as Dean, feels that the
Office of Student Affairs has had
a "positive year. striving to.pro-
vide support services to students.
to provide those things which are
essential to students at Pitt.“

“The very effective, meaningful
and positive relationship between
this office and student leaders
has,” in Moye’s words, lead to “a

certain sort of openness which is.

very gratifying.”

The »“positive“ aspects of the
past years activities have in-
cluded increased services for
graduate and night school stu-
dents. a greater involvement by
the student body in matters of
government, a successful fresh-
man orientation program. an ex-
panded mentor program which
has encouraged interest from
other campuses across the coun-
try. a_s well as the cooperative
writing clinic. .

Moye. hwoever. felt that the
“most exciting advances" were
the "remarkable student inter-
est“ in the Homecoming Queen
elections. and the success of the
referendum on student activities
fees.

“The referendum was a big
success from the standpoint of
positive action,” explained Moye,
“since it gave every student on
campus a chance to make a state-
ment about his feelings toward

Counseling Organization

Broadens Its Service

Pitt's student-to-student coun-
seling and referral service. A Lit-
tle Help from Your Friends. is

, now broadening its scope in an
"r, attempt to aid more students.

Since its inception in the spring
of 1971 as a YMCA project. the
service has been known primarily
as a drug counseling organiza-
tion. Last September. however. it
became a part of the University
Counseling Service. and has pro-
vided Pitt students with a refer-
ral service for problems ranging
from legal questions to loneliness.

The 13 concerned students who
comprise the Friends answer
telephones from 8 p.m‘. to 12 mid-

_night, seven nights a week. Stu-
dents may also go directly to their
offices at 205 Schenley Hall during
the day. The Friends are trained

/ in ‘‘listening techniques” in week-

ly meetings held by Dr. Joyce
Ford, a University Counselor.

At meetings the staffers are
also kept up to date on their or-
ganizations coordination with
other agencies. According to stu-
dent coordinator Eileen Olson.
more volunteers are needed im-
mediately to prepare for helping

out during spring and summer

terms. I
Olson also stated that her or-
ganization is investigating the
possibility of establishing a place
for people to stay who just need
somewhere to "crash." The Can-
adian Youth Hostels are being
studied to see if such an arrange-
ment would fill the current void
of such facilities in the Pittsbrugh
area. A Little Help from Your

"Friends may be reached at Uni-

versity ext. 6773 or 687-5145. _

 

the activities fee and particular
activities.”

The fact that "visible involve-

- ment in areas of interest outside

of the campus has been low." ac-
cording to Moye. “is not a matter
of lack of interest but rather a
question of a nationwide change in
consciousness; students just are
not oriented toward publicity. - \,

Dean Moye went on to discuss
the Office of Student. Affairs‘
priorities over the next several
months. The Office will be con-
centrating on seven major con-
cerns. ranging from the plans for
the new Student Union. to increas-
ing the student opportunities for
involvement in governmental
work.

The Office will be spending “a
lot of time and manpower” on the
plans for the new Union, because
of the seriousness of problems at
the University with utilization of
available space. At the same
time, Moye added, “We will be
working on the problem of on-
campus housing for graduate stu-
dents and the general housing
shortage.”

Moye also discussed the two
new offices on campus. the Office
of Resident Life and the Office of
Veterans Affairs. both in their in-
fancy. Mo_ye's department intends
"to spend a lot of time trying to
maximize their usefulness."

Moye went on to mention his
commitment to developing more
minority interest in applying to
professional schools. his work on
solving the problems of handicap-
ped students at Pitt. and the hope
for "better programming. orient-
ed toward increasing the already
excellent relations between the
Office of Student Affairs and the
academic offices; of the Univer-
sity." ~ '

New Food Plan Studied

by DEBBIE POPP

A subcommittee of the Board-
ing Food Service Committee has
been f'ormed toinvestigate a con-
tinuous feeding program for the
residence halls. Continuous feed-
ing programs are in operation at
Kent State and in universities
throughout the south. The attrac-
tion of such programs is the ex-
tended meal hours often continu-
ing from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Variants of the program also
offer no restrictions on how many
times a student may enter the
‘cafeteria to a limit of three or two.

The obvious advantage of the
continuous feeding is the student
may not have to schedule classes
or activities around restricted
meal hours.

Schools with a continuous feed-
ing plan expand their‘menus to in-
clude a continental breakfast, a
brunch. and a cold luncheon serv-
ed ‘between the three main meals.

No additional costs a-re expeC_t- _

 

ed if a continuous feeding pro-‘_
gram were-instituted at Pitt. In _
fact. “possible ‘savings may be;
involved over the long haul, says
Donovan Hughes, Associate Di‘- *-
rector of Housing, since the staff  
would not have to prepare for the:
build up of 2,700 students at thefz;
present peak hours. _ -‘ _ ,
The Continuous Feeding Sub-‘
committee is expected to read are ,
ticles and publications before they 
submit their report to the Food ,_
Service Committee. To. supple-T 
ment their information, the sub- ,- 
committee is planning a- trip to.’ 
Kent State to appraise the opera-—— 
tion of their continuous feeding ;
program. "-

Bev Kaplan. a member of the V .,
subcommittee, explained. "Peio-~ -. 
pie with” different class schedules‘ . 
will benefit from the program;
We should see how it works and if
it is possible to institute continu-
ous feeding at Pitt." she said. '

Suit Soon To Be Filed To Aid Student Tenants

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

The Pitt Tenant Union recently
started discussions with lawyers
about the filing of a class action
suit against “the University hous-
ing contracts and the standard
leases used by local landlords for
student tenants,” according to
Timmy Ging, a Pitt junior, who
heads the Tenant Union.

Ging explained that the suit has
been held up because of funding
problems, and because of a De-
cember filing of a similar suit by
ex-State Attorney General J.
Shane Creamer against 25 land-
lords and major lease-printing
companies.

Creamer’s suit was against
“leases that contain unfair or
misrepresentative clauses either

legally or morally.” Ging explain-
ed. He went on to further clarify
the state’s class action suit. say-
ing that “a precedent will be set
which will hold the landlord and
the printing company responsible
for the leases, so even if the land-
lord is mis-informed the printing
company will be forced into taking
the responsibility of seeing that
the leases are fair and legal."

The advantage of the state’s
suit, according to Ging, is that
“the landlord figures that if a
clause is in a lease, then it’s legal
and he can try to enforce it upon
his tenant. At the same time the
tenant is misinformed and he also
accepts the legality of the lease.
With this suit, the printing com-
pany and then the landlord will be
liable for the illegality of the
lease, and the big circle of ignor-
ance will be broken.

Ging explained that the Pitt suit
would not originally have included
the printing companies. but after
hearing about the state’s suit the
Tenant Union decided to include
lease printers. The suit has been
approved by the Allocations Com-
mittee.

“The problem now," according
to Dan Dolinsky, also of the Ten-
ant Union, "is we don‘t know what
the new Attorney General will do

about the class action suit. It is
possible that he (Israel Packet).
may just let it drop or he may
pursue it, we will simply have to
hold off for a couple of months.
and wait to see what happens at
the state level." :

Dolinsky also mentioned the
possibility of getting other tenant
organizations in Pittsburgh or in
other cities, such as Temple in
Philadelphia. “Then we would
have the two biggest cities in state
involved in a class action suit,”
he explained.

Ging felt the nature of the mis-
leading, unfair, and illegal claus-
es in present leases against
which the suits are being filed
were best clarified by giving ex-
amples from leases commonly
used by landlords renting to Pitt
students. He felt that four basic
kinds of fraudulent clauses might
be identified:

“One landlord in Oakland agrees
that his lease is unfair and unen-
forceable, but he says that he uses
it as a psychological tool to get
the students to do what he wants—
this might be called using the
lease as a ‘psychological weap-
on,“‘ said Ging.

Two clauses from a common
lease type read as follows:

There shall be no gatherings in
the apartment of more than ten
persons. There shall be no grease
allowed to accumulate on any of
the kitchen appliances and the ten-
ant must wax the bathroom and
kitchen tile floors within two weeks
after moving in.

“Another kind of unfair clause."
according to Ging. “is one which
contains flagrant and fraudulent

misrepresentations for the pur-
pose of confusing the tenant."
This second use of the contract
might be exemplified by the fol-
lowing:

The Lessor agrees to furnish heat
to the premisies . . . (but) . . . it is
agreed that the Lessor shall not be
held liable for failure to do so. The
Lessor shall not be liable for any
damage or injury to any person or
porperty at any time in the leased
premises . . occasioned by failure
of the lessor to keep said premises
in repair and shall not be liable for
any injury done or occasioned by or
resulting from any defeat in
plumbing, electrical wiring, or in-
sulating, gas pipes, water pipes,
or steam pipes.

Ging described a third kind of
illegal clause as “prostitution of
the tenants’ rights; in other words
a situation in which by signing
the lease the tenant signs away
his rights.

An example of this kind of
clause in the standard contracts
signed by Pitt students living off
campus might be the following:

The tenant waives all rights and
the benefits of all laws now or
hereafter enforced in this state or
elsewhere to the lessor.

The final kind of misleading, un-
fair. or illegal clause that will be
"fought by the state’s class action
suit. or the one that may be filed
by the Pitt Tenant Union's suit as
the case may be," was termed by
Ging. as “blatant stupidity." A

Ging gave as an example the
Landlord-Tenant Act of 1951.
amended in 1968, which clearly
states that "any attempted waiv-
er of this section by a tenant. by a

: contract or otherwise shall be

void and unenforceable.” Yet a
lease held by a Pitt students con-
tains the following passage:

“And the tenant expressly
waives the Act Number 20 approv-
ed April 6, 1951, entitled the Land-
lord-Tenant Act of l951.”

Ging believes that the problem
of illegal clauses is three—fold:
"mis-informed printing compa-
nies, mis-informed landlords and
apathetic, mis-informed students.
Only by a concerted effort to edu-
cate tenants, and force responsi-
bility upon the landlords and the
printing companies, can this prob-
lem of consumer protection be
solved.“

Chris Schnatterly. also a mem-

optimistic of the programs adop-
tion. Schnatterly said, “The con-

shadowed by the optional meal
plan that may be adopted next
term." —

  Coirdomone Slrugg

by ROB OBENREDER

It's a simple gymastics wariii-
up exercise. but something is
wrong. Your hands‘ are ripped
from the rings. and you crash to
the floor. All the force of your
falling body is concentrated on
one fragile portion of your back.
and the strain is far too much.

Suddenly you're paralyzed: ino-
tionless from the waist down.

This is the nightmare that be-
came reality for Tom Cardamone,
an energetic Pitt gymnast whose
involvement in sports has dom-
inated his life—an athlete who d_e-
rived deep satisfaction from his
physical prowess.

Athletes feed on challenges.
and Tom has met many in his
sports career. Now he is confront-
ed with the most awesome task of
his life: overcoming total para-
lysis.

Discouraging events are not
new to Tom. As a freshman. he
joined the football team as a walk-
on: a person who is not recruited
with offers of money and glory.
but desires to play a sport for
personal enrichment and satisfac-
tion. He entered freshman camp
with the added disadvantage of be-
ing five feet seven inches tall and
weighing 166 pounds.

Walk-ons and small men are giv-
en little recognition at Pitt. They
did not fit into Carl DePasqua’s
vision of college football. Despite‘
his great desire and ability, prov-
en by two interceptions and a.
touchdown during a varisty scrim-
mage, Tom was ignored by the
varsity coaches.

' During his sophomore year.
Tom's friends encouraged him to
abandon football and tryout for‘
the gymnastics team. Although
football was his first love. the dis-
couragement of the coaches and

the lack of recognition prompted
him to investigate gymnastics.

The transition from football to
gymnastics is not easy. and Tom
had little experience in the latter
sport. He was faced with the
task of developing a different
mental attitude. one attuned to an
individual. rather than a team.
sport. and of adapting to new
training procedures.

Football calls for taut muscu-
lar development while gymnas-
tics requires litheness. Tom’s
junior year was spent recondi-
tioning his body and getting ac-
customed to unfamilar equipment.

This year. as a senior. he was a
member of the ring team. and was
anticipating his first and only sea-
son as a varsity gymnast. These
expectations were shattered by
his disastrous accident.

The thought of being totally im-
mobile can chill the most seden-
'tary person. To an athlete it is the
ultimate horror. The shock and

depression that accompany such

an accident are intensifed when
one previously has been physical-
_ ly active.

But Tom’s determination, a
quality which has helped him
overcome many challenges, has
again’ prevailed. Ari accident such
as~his is generally fatal, but
through expert medical attention,
good physical condition, and bull-
ish determination Tom has sur-
vived the ordeal.

His doctors are astounded a_t
his progress. Although still total-

‘ ly paralyzed. his back is healing

and he can experience sensations
‘in his extremities. ‘

He was in traction only three
weeks. about half the time usually
.required in such cases. Now he is
‘undergoing therapy using a tilt
board. gradually being raised to

a vertical position. After this cru-
cial test. he will be able to sit in a
wheelchair which will give him
more mobility than his present
bed confinement.

Though his recovery will be
slow and tedious, Tom has already
shown that he is willing to fight
for the use of his body. He is not

Registration Woes

Dear Mr. Posvar:

_I‘have just spent two hours in
he Cathedral of Learning paying
myinvoice, which needed adjust-
ment because of my newly acquir-
d state residency. I found this a
mqst frustrating experience due

rnployees in the various depart-
ments dealing with registration,

._ illedout by an employee, I was
.--directed to an incorrect room, I

_I'had to endure ill treatment or
‘no «attention "at all—while em-
I, ployees conversed with each
-Tother.

 One person, Marion S. Woods.

‘ ‘_'- terested in the students with
‘‘;,whom she worked. A registration
;:system is only as efficient as the
employees who attempt to help
-; .51,-the students through it. I would i
 [suggest that Pitt’s system is anti-
.}_» ’quated—in comparison with the
ﬁx;-.system at two other midwestern
universities I have attended. A
 management study or.some other
. investigation is needed for this

I When I wrote in one article that Senator Mc-
”T(Govern and his ideas were “wrong” for America,
I was’ according the Senator a treatment that would
{apply equally to George: Wallace, particularly in
1968. Wallace, in his fiery, radical style, launched a
E" useless campagin against blacks and “pointy-
'_headed” liberals. Surely, he was being honest and
“politically pure" by speaking exactly as he felt,
but his ideas were too extremely right-wing for our
country's blo_od. George Wallace was “wrong.”

 , And so it"was with Senator McGovern, except
-that his ideas were too far to the left. The result
“was a defeat I called “more inglorious” than that in
1964 of Barry Goldwater, another “wrong” politi-
Tcal purist. One writer responded with figures to

Perhaps thexsaddest thing that I learned from
the angry letters was that McGovern supporters
still believe they represented most Democrats and
most liberals. The facts seem to indicate some-
thing else. During the campaign, many Democratic
candidates sought to divorce themselves from the
radical Presidential ticket, fearing that they. too.
would be identified as radical liberals. The gains of
Democrats in local races around the country show-
ed how much different from McGovern those liber-
als were. And right now, a group of liberals called
the Coalition for a Democratic Majority is seeking
to rebuild the party that McGovern’s “New Poll-
tics“ put to shame. Hopefully, our country willcon-
tinue to have its share of such intelligent liberals.

No Launch  A

Editor, The Pitt News:

During the evening of Dec. 6.
1972, millions of TV viewers gath-
ered around their sets to witness
the launch of Apollo 17—man‘s
manned mission to the
moon. Historically, not only did
the launch represent the last
great effort in moon exploration
for some time to come, it also be-
came the first manned ~night
launch in U.S. space history.

/ As the launch did not take place
on schedule
many viewers undoubtedly be-
came irritated at the continuance
of successive 22 minute delays.

. There were, however, a select

few, who at the time viewing the
launch procedures in the Tower
A color TV lounge, that had legi-
timate reason to become at least
perturbed if not furious. The di-
rect source of disappointment for
each of the approximately 25
weary but interested student
viewers came from the telévision
attendants’ behavior and attitude.

As the delays in the launch con-
tinued, it was ‘ evident that the
news reporters- on the network be-
ing viewed were very incompe-
tent in handling these delays. Des-
cribing the liquid hydrogen and
oxygen fuels as behind “more
than ice cold” was one of the more
than inadequate and over-simpli-
fied analogies used by the unpre-
pared commentator. Realizing
this, a student inquired whether
or not a majority of those present
wished to view another network.
The TV attendant immediately re-
buked the student as if he was
out of line in his request.

The channel was not changed
and the entire incident implied
that the TV attendant possessed
absolute control of the set. By
midnight, due to further delays,
the launch had not yet taken place.

-. .1'_

local left that mature people are good losers who
can accept defeat. I have both read of and talked to
people who felt that the all-black “Four More
Year’s front page of the Pitt News was a childish ,
act, a failure to accept defeat gracefully. The same
thing applies to the continued wearing of McGovern-
campaign buttons, especially since no amount of
tin trinkets will stop poverty, misery, and war, or
even make George McGovern President.

So even if it means being called a reactionary.
bourgeois, immature, repugnant, and bitter baby.
I still think America’s political system would be
better without bad losers and radical, be they left-
wing or right-wing.

It was at this point the arrogant
attendant in question strode up to
the set and promptly turned it off.

With a cocky grin he then an-_.

nounced, “See you all later," and
further added rather emphatical-
ly that no one could remain in the
lounge. A few verbal objections
by the students concerning the sit-
uation were futile.

As it turned out, the vacating

‘of the lounge had taken place just

minutes before the long-awaited
launch. The key to the lounge was
taken to the desk in the main lob-
by and supposedly locked in the
safe for the night, therefore, elim-
inating a possible reopening of the
lounge that night. Aside from the
"secured key” the only question
in the possibility of reopening the
lounge until the launch had actual-
ly taken place was the lack of su-
pervision. Granted, if the atten-
dant in question had to leave at 12
midnight for personal reasons or
because his job was done for the
night, surely one of the three or

four campus policemen who had ’

congregated at the desk in the
main lobby could have been used
for supervision of the lounge.

In light of the historical value
that accompanied the mission, it
is appalling that all of those pre-
sent in the lounge at the time of
the “shutout” were denied the op-
portunity to witness this unique
moment in our nation's history. It
should be brought to the attention
of the Student Housing Commit-
tee that students attending this
University should not be subjected .
to this kind of inconsideration.
Furthermore, it is obvious that
little care was exercised in select-
ing this particular attendant. It
should not have been unreasonable
to extend the 12 midnight limit of
the lounge to include the comple-

tion of the launch.

It is hoped the Housing Com-
mittee will give serious thought
to this incident and that some kind
of precaution will be made to en-
sure the non-occurrence of such
another incident. If not. what will
we miss next.? _? ?

April The Cruelest
Month Blues, Mama

by DENNIS PALUMBO

» “You're an English major, baby,
What’re gonna do
There ain't a big "boss in the world
Gonna go and hire you
This is all l ever hear now
So’s my ears are turnin’ red
. Next mother who says a word to me
Gets a bullet in the head

(CHORUS)
’Cause I got outta here in April
' Spent four years payin’ my dues
But it don’t look like I'll get work "
lgot them April-the-cruelest-month blues . . .”

_”Actually, I don’t mind the possibility of probable unemploymeht;
I‘m just sick of talking about it with every clown I run into.

_ Not counting my parents (who gave up on me three years ago when
I quit engineering). I've been criticized for my choice of study by at
least half of my relatives, the family doctor, the milkman, four sets of
neighbors, a TV repairman, two guys’who came to hang drapes, three
former high school teachers, a lifeguard I met in Sandusky, everybody
I worked with at J&L, the newspaper boy, and a nice couple that picked
me up once when I was thumbing to Oakland. I

The apparent variety of personalities involved means absolutely
nothing, at least as far as the line of questioning goes. It’s_very simple.

INTERESTED PARTY: What do you do?

ME: I’m a student. -

INTERESTED PARTY: Where?

ME: Pitt.

INTERESTED PARTY: What are you taking up?

ME: I’m a writing major in the English department.

INTERESTED PARTY: What are you gonna do with it?

ME: '-Well, as soon as it dries, I thought I'd take it down to Forbes Ave.

and sell it as a hand-carved paperweight. /

That particular reply is reserved for those days when I’m not feel-
ing especially nasty about the subject, or when I’ve been picked up by a
benevolent soul who might find reason to dump me out of his car if he
feels insulted. - V’

At any rate, since everyone seems to think a degree is a solid,
three-dimensional object which one carries in his pocket and presents
to a prospective employer upon demand, I’ve decided that it is far bet-
ter to have a. good answer prepared’ than to try to explain the myriad
considerations which must be explored before an occupation is settled
upon. (Which is just fancy talk for “whenever a job turns up, jump on
it.”)

If, however, the conversation should happen to turn in the direc-
tion of your schooling (as it always does, sooner or later), you might
try to answer the query in any of the following manners:

INTERESTED PARTY: Liberal arts, eh?

YOU: That’s right.

INTERESTED PARTY: What are you taking up? .

YOU: a) philosophy, b) English, c) history.

INTERESTED PARTY: What are you gonna do when you get out‘?
YOU: a) Think. b) Read. c) Learn from it. '

INTERESTED PARTY: You'll probably starve. ,

YOU: a) Since nothing exists, that is absurd. b) The creative artist us-

ually lives in poverty. c) That is certainly not without precedent.

The only other alternative is to explain that you passionately love
the subject of philosophy (or English or history) and that you chose it
simply because you wanted to devote the rest of your life to its propaga-
tion and improvement. Chances are, however, that the other party will
not buy this reply, since practically nobody really goes to college for
those reasons.

And to that remark, unfortunately. there is no reply but oneof
agreement,‘ ‘ * V ‘ i

by KEITH SHUSTER

A wind of eerie despair whist-
led over the barren (terrain of
Franz Woyzeck’s mind in the pro-
duction of Woyzeck last weekend
at the Studio Theatre. His face.
fragmented by the netting through
which he peered, and grotesquely
disfigured by the light which
seemed to freeze him into posi-
tion, was familiar in some arche-
typal sense.

Oedipus cognizant of his sins.
the tortured look of a medieval
gargoyle, the sculpted face _.of
sorrows of a Massacio Christ.
the horror of a Joseph Conrad
here understanding for the first
time what man is beneath his so-
cial veneer; all these were Woy-
zeck.

I

His eyes pierced through his
surroundings and the audience
with the dark clarity of psychosis.
His spirit was the constant for the
rest of the evening. We found our-
selves in the center of a distorted
mind, moving through a world
full of Bosch-like creatures, a
world of cruel logical morality.

Left unfinished by the German '
y.--genius Georg Buchner at his early

“death in 1837, Woyzeck has long

so-.,.beén acknowledged as one of the "

first realistic plays ever written,
based as it was on the true ac-
count of a soldier who murdered
his mistress. Yet the inherent
structure of the work, feeding off
Franz Woyzeck’s crazed percep-
tions. has an organic flexibility
that demands more than cut and
dried realism.

Thus director Richard Men-

nen’s conception of Woyzeck has
the spasmodic rhythm of an un-

settled mind, the only too real
realism of nightmares, the pic-
ture of life as a series of snap-
shots of carnival time at Bedlam.

Despite the fact that the pro-
ductionwas the class project for
Mennen’s Speech 27 course, and
that he had to deal with a large
amount of input, much of it from
people with no previous theatrical
experience, Dr. Mennen managed
to unify the chaos within the play
and production group into the con-
fusion of a madman in a mad so-
ciety.

I suspect that much of this unity
stemmed from the growth of a
common agreement within the
class as to the interpretation of
Woyzeck, for there was no aspect
of the production which didn't
flow into the others.

Bob Trenner’s scene design of
intersecting nets supported the
basically contradictory nature of
the play; Ironically enough, nets
are walls with holes in them. They
divided the acting areas, but
loosely. Th/ey caught. and bound
Franz Woyzeck, but he could see
too well through them. They gave
a sense of spaciousness, but the‘
illusion was constructed of rope.

Kathy Kearney’s lighting design
followed the action, tying one
scene to another with a shadowy
precision. At times there was a

. vague dusky quality to the light as

if Franz soul was wrapped in
cotton. At other points, harsh bril-
liance throbbed with painful

awareness. The accompanying’

sound by Niles Sayre cried of

aloneness and fear. There was 

created the kind of surreal atmos-
phere where faces fade in and out
of sight, where voices murmur in-

mingled with the imagery of_ folk
superstitions, toadstools, hedge-

revolved around and within Woy-

pounding the ground in an attempt
to drown out those sounds in his
head, stabbing Marie again and
again and again with that knife.
left at the end alone in his own
county of the mind. A pervasive
sense of what he sees happening
around him links the entire play.

The remainder of the cast con-

formed fairly well to Woyzeck’s

perception of them. Niles Sayre
fulfilled one’s worst fears about
stuffy self-righteousness and sad-
istic bent of the military artiso—
cracy. His match-in the field of
science was Ron Sopyla’s por-

he pounced on each of Woyzeck's
aberrations like a triumphant vul-
ture.

Myrna Cohen as the mother of
Woyzeck’s son, seemed unable to
intuitively grasp the core of Ma-
rie. In one scene she was a temp-
tress, in another Christian's
mother, in another a repentant
sinner. But there was no compre-
hension of how these women were
one except for residing in the
same body. Woyzeck’s dependen-
cy on her as the source of beauty
in his life prevented her fluctua-
tions in character from being
distractions.

society taunted him like so many

Skin Wildcats Tonight

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

.\'othing looks better right now to the 4-7 Pan-
ther hoopsters than the prospect of burning the Dav-
idson Wildcats tonight at the Field House at 8 p.m.

The Panthers had the pleasure of skinning the
Wildcats last year in one of their rare television ap-
pearances by a 91-78 score. The defeat of this peren-
nially good basketball squad was a feat-in itself but
in addition to this. the victory for the Panthers came
on foreign soil.

Winning on the road is something that the Pitt
team has not been able to accomplish so far this
season. They have dropped all four of their away
games so far.

To break this streak and to sustain their win-
ning streak against Davidson will not be an easy
task for the cagers.

With 11 games in the season. the’ Wildcats
have collected a record which is just the opposite of
the Panthers. 7-4. Their fourdefeats have come
from the following opponents: Princeton by the
score of 82-78; Cincinnati. 95-84; South Carolina
State. 103-90. and in their last showing the Wildcats
were edged 78-77 by St. Johns

Davidson‘s head coach Terr_v Holland had pre-
dicted before the start of the season that his squad
would be equally strong offensively and defensively.
The Wildcats’ defense. however. lhas not been as

consistently strong as had been thot/ight.‘The de-

fenders have been playing on and off all season.
averaging a 70 point give away per game. giving up
80 points or more in half of their showings.

Amply compensating for the defense when they

are playing an off game are the Wildcats’ outstand-

ing shooters. Too such players for‘ Davidson are
John Peeorak and John Falconi. ~

At 6-6 Peeorak averaged 11.5 points last year
and according to Holland is one of the country‘s
most underrated, players. The senior forward ‘led

‘game.

the Southern Conference last year in field goal per-
centage.

Falconi. a 6-5 guard. was the leading scorer
for the Wildcats in their '72 campaign. averaging
16.1 points per game.

The Panthers have many problems that must
be solved if they hope to whip the strong Wildcats.

Of paramount importance is the Panthers‘ in-
ability to reach the .500 mark in their shooting
game. According to Pitt's head coach "Buzz“ Hidl.
one of the reasons for this disability is in having to
many players to fill too few open positions on the
squad. 1

"I‘d like’ to concentrate on using seven to eight
players but I'm afraid we can‘t.'”related Ridl who
has had to shuffle 10-12 cagers in each contest.

“We have a number of players of near equal
ability. We’ll get a good game from some of them
one night, and a fine performance from some others
the next time. I’d rather have a set lineup but that’s
not possible right now.”

Mickey Martin and Carl Morris seems to-have

capture positions at forward and Bill Knight has the
guard spot. but two positions still remain no one's
property. \

"The shuffling has given all of our players the
opportunity to gain experience. but I hope in future
games to settle down to a more set lineup." stated
the Pitt mentor. “I suspect our shooting will im-
prove when we do."


Knight and Martin won’t have to worry abotit‘!/
trying to improve their shooting performances tre-'“*-_r

mendouslyin the near future.

Knight leads the Pitt squad with a 21.5 point av-
erage per game. In addition he is averaging 10 re-

bounds and 35 assists.

Martin is also in the double figures with a 11.5
shooting average and an average of six rebounds per

 Bits and Pieces OfA  

Long Fruitful Holiday

Dismissing Channel. 11 televi-
sportscaster Sam Nover’s
comments about Johnny Maiors,
Pitt's new head football coach,
as idle, I definitely think Cas
Myslinski has grabbed the ‘big
name’ this time.

Nover seems to
think-that if all
Pitt could get was
a 5-6-1 (Major's
record in ‘72)
coach. the Pitts
were still in trou-
ble.‘\‘(jood insight
except...

First of all. Ma-
jors turned down
jobs at Michigan State, Southern
Methodist, Kentucky, and Iowa
State before excepting the Pitt
job. And the reason so many peo-
ple wanted him was because. des-
pite having lost more games
than hewon at Iowa State. he
was in the Big Eight Conference.

 

.He played Nebraska to a 23-23
standoff and lost only because
his team failed to convert an ex-
tra point. He also was tied with
Oklahoma until two late touch-
downs wiped the Cyclones out.
His loss to Georgia Tech in the
Liberty Bowl was by one point.

But most important, he took a
lowly Iowa State program —yes.
even lower than Pitt—and brought
it two Bowl appearences in four
years there. Furthermore. Iowa
State had not been to a Bowl
game in its history. Not too bad

for a 37 year old coach.

After meeting him personally
there is no doubt in my mind that
he can incite Pitt's group of
young men who take pride in
calling themselves football play-
ers.

Sorry ‘Sam. I think you are
wrong. again.

* * >I¢
This is what one Pitt 'official'

had to say when Myslinski an-
nounced that he was looking for
a Big Name coach:

“If Cas wants a big name.
why doesn't he get Antonio Ni-
colocopolos as the Pitt coach‘?
Thats about as big a name as
anyone can find." .

Funny! '-But I think Cas will
settle for John Majors.

* * *

Who is Rooster Fleming?

Rumor had it that Rooster, who
is from the Hazelwood area of
town and a successful Canadian
Football League star, was after
the Pittjob.

Rooster would have made a
good candidate if Pitt wasn‘t
going to spend a lot of money
on the coach‘s salary. I hear Pitt
could have gotten him for “chick-
en feed."

Pitt coach Tom Myers claimed
that his team was able to get
away with a less_ll1an spectacular
performance when he said. "Con-

tage in the shots on categoy. St.
Vincent goalie Andy Labraska
really couldn't be faulted on any
of the goals he allowed. The near
constant pressure by the Pitt of-
fense was too much for the St.
Vincent defense to handle.

Dave Bahnson provided Pitt
with all the goals they really need-

ed. getting the hat trick. Two of

Bahnson's goals came on perfect
deflections right on the top ol the
crease.

Denny Browne started the scor-
ing at 5:51,oi' the first period with

his eleventh goal of the season.
On a face off in the St. Vincent
end. center Billy Glanyille drew
the puck back to Browne. who was
stationed in the slot. Labraska
was caught still hugging the post
as Browne‘s quick shot found the
opposite corner.

Bahnson tallied his first mark-
er about six minutes later with as-
sists from Tom Lange and Greg
Mintz. Bahnson got his stick on
Mintz’ shot from the point and de-
flected it past Labraska to give
Pitt a 2-0 lead after first period

Two and a half minutes into the
second period Bahnson picked up
where he left off. With help from
his linemates Tom Lang and
Frank Williams. Bahnson gave
his team a 3-0 lead in a scramble

in front of Labraska.

Hardly a minute later Bich Bag-
lnski found the back of the nets
on a brilliant single effort. Bag-
inski took the puck and stickhand-
ed around the net to stuff it past
Labraska. St. Vincents wouldn't
roll over and die. however.

At 4:25 Jeff Fondell found him-
self in the right place at the ‘right
time to shoot a rebound in over
Pitt netminder Mark Lieberman.
Lieberman had come out of the

net to clear a loose puck awayaf;\_~

from the onrushing Wayne Car-
leton. Carleton beat Lieberman to
the puck and shot, but Lieberman
made the save. Fondell cruised in
and flipped the rebound over the
