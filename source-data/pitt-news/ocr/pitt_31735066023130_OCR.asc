Vol. 74. No. 51 ’

Students packed David Lawrence Auditorium Monday night to show their opposition to the new dormitory guidelines.

By BOB WARMKESSEL
Pitt News Staff Writer
The anger and frustration of

' many resident students displeased

with the university’s new visitation

policy surfaced Monday night at a

forum with Dr. Conney M. Kimbo,‘
« ice chancellor for student affairs,

in David Lawrence Hall.

An overﬂow crowd packed the
auditorium to listen to Kimbo’s ex-
planatiori fo how the policy came
about and to ask questions about
the new regulations. The audience
became increasingly "vocal as the
question and answer period con-
tinued. ‘ ' ’

sea Draft

By PATTI LAN GFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Martin Bertocchi’s proposal to
send information to President
Carter stating that Pitt stude’nts
were opposed to draft registration
caused much controversy among

‘‘ SGB members andaudience at last

night's SGB meeting held in the

lower lounge of the Student Union. _

Bertocchi based his proposal on
last week’s forum, stating that,
“Part of the idea of the forum was
to come up with ideas that could be
sent to the president.” I He also
reasoned that SGB should make a
deﬁnite stand on the draft registra-
tion issue inorder to keep student
interest alive whether they agreed
with the stand or not. ‘ 2

A 2 At the outset of Bertocchi-’s -pro-A

Council, questioned the university’s
right to change the policy. She said
‘the “Student Rig/hts Within the
University Community” document
provides students the right “to
organize one’s own personal
behavior as long as such behavior
does not violate public law or the
rights of others, _and does not in-.
terfere with the educational pro-
cess.” She believed the new policy
violated that provision. ‘ ' ~_
“To change a- policy is not a
violation of your rights, as long it’s

' changed at the end of the year,”

Kimbo said. .
The policy will take effect at the
beginning of spring semester.
Later in the meeting another stu-

posal, SGB members were mainly
concerned with discerning what the
purpose of last week’s forum really
was.

SGB member Walter Burke
stated that he believed the forum
was to access the feelings of
students and toforward them to the
president and Senate.

“In no way did I anticipate on tak-
ing such a stand,” he said. .

dent, Mark Weyda, restated
McDevitt’s argument proceeded to
the front of the auditorium to pre-
sent Kimbo with a copy of the stu-
dent rights. ' Weyda received a stan-
ding ovation fromthe crowd.

‘Al Bowen, director of the Office
of Special Student Services and the
major draftsman of the student
rights document several years ago,
said yesterday he had not studied
the new visitation policy but said an
institution such as Pitt “can
regulate behavior when it has a

-legitimate interest.” -

“The university is-responsible for
what happens in-residence halls,

and because the university has that

interest, it has «the right to‘ regulate

this,” he added.

According to Bernadette Herward;
another SGB member, “We cannot
say we’re for or against because the
students themselves cannot say.”

“A definitive statement will bring A

condemnation on board,” said
board’ member Scott Hendler.

In repartee to board members ob-
jections Bertocchi presented a peti-

tion containing the signatures of

Another concern of SGB members ' \_;1r4'8 students opposing draft

was whether or not they would be
upholding their responsibilities to
student body" in supporting Bertoc-
chi’s proposal. ' V

“With student opinion being split
we can't take one stand, as we
represent the students,” Alan Mele,
SGB member. ‘‘It would be a total’

lack of. .responsibility ’ to __aceept '

registration and urging the SGB to
take a deﬁnite stand in their favor.

Board members discussed whether 
or not the 148. students who signed 2

what goes on,” Bowen said.

Charlene Hunter, coordinator of
the university’s Student Judicial
System, was ill yesterday and could
not be reached for her interpreta-
tion of the new policy.

McDevitt also note the right of
students,,according to the student
right document, to have their views
heard at “appropriate levels‘of the
decision-making process.” She
claimed students were not given
enough input in the review and
revision of the policy. _

Many _ students were ~ concerned
about the provision in the policy
that would prohibit overnight
guests of the opposite sex from
visiting residents between 2-10 a.m.
One student asked why residents
were being penalized for an “ad-
ministrative breakdown” concern-
ing enforcement of the present
residence. hall policy. Another

whether ‘the overnight rule was

Kimbo’s answers stressed that the
new policy will maintain privacy
and security and will bring the
university’s policies in line with
other major universities. However,
students appeared dissatisfied with
some of Kimbo’s answers; several
times students in the crowd yelled,
“Answer the question.”

Wednesday, February 6, L198-07»-'-*

Earlyiin the meeting, students at
the rear of the auditorium unfurled
a banner saying “Monastery of
Pittsburgh. ’ ’ -

Kirnbo said the policy was not
made to try to improve Pitt’s
chances of getting increased fun
ding from the state. ' V '

“No one asked me to review a

policy because of ﬁnancial ‘con-‘

siderations,” he said.

A female resident student ex-
pressed concemabout the cost‘ of
implementing the new regualtions.

“The policy should be up to the
students who pay tuition or the tax-
payers, not those who get paid,”
the student said. .

Another student thought the

' policy should be voted upon by the

students. Kimbo said such a pro-’

‘cedure “would not be acceptable

to the administration or to the
Board of Trustees.”
, Methods of implementing the

A march and rally protesting
possible U.S. military intervention
in the Persian Gulf has been

scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 9, in‘

downtown Pittsburgh. —
The march, sponsored by the
activist group Mobilization for
Survival, will begin at noon in front
of the Federal Building. From
there, it will proceed to Market
Square, after a brief detour to the

headquarters of Rockwell Inter-
national. The rally, protesting
against U.S. increasing military
and ﬁnancial commitments in the
region of Pakistan and the Indian
Ocean, will be held in Market
Square after the march. A
representative of the group, Molly
Rush, said the continuing build-up
of military forces is not an effective
way of controlling events in today’s
world. A A

“The proper place to raise the

issue of the U.S. hostages in Iran
and Soviet intervention in Afghan-
istan is in the United Nations,” she
added. ’ ‘ ,

The group hopes that their
actions will demonstrate a growing
opposition to any military action
against Iran or the Soviet Union,
according to Rush. V

The headquarters of Rockwell
International has also been target-
ed for protests, Rush said, due to
their continuing involvement with

College of Arts and Sciences
Dean Irwin Schulman has ap-
pointed a faculty Committee on
Curriculum Reform. Their fin-
dings, which should be available by
the end of the year, may affect the
number and nature of coursed that
Pitt students take outside of their
major. .

Schulman said part of the pro-
blem is the fact that students just
don’t receive enough guidance.

“The ordinary student gets quite
a bit of guidance and structure once

Nghe gets a major. He learns his re-

quirements, the sequence of
courses, etc. But the major will on-
ly occupy approximately one-third
of his time. And in that other time,
he is supposed to get a liberal arts
education,” Schulman said.

The problem then, is that the

favor of draft registration.

Suggestions were made by
members to have a referendum or
survey to distinguish who among
the student body was opposed or
not opposed to the draft registra-
tion. An understanding was reach-
ed by the end of the meeting that
the possibility of a referendum
would be discussed at tomorrow’s
board planning session.

Ultimately Bertocchi’s ’ proposal
was rejected with seven against the

abstention. »

other two-thirds of the time,
“Where the student gets no
guidance-it’s an unhealthy situa-
tion. It seems to suggest that the
college doesn’t know what it’s do-
ing. We should guide the student.”
said Schulman.

Schulman said that the more
‘stringent requirements and cur-
riculum were abandoned a decade
ago.

“What we need is a redefinition
of the purposes of the college. That
was my major ‘interest in being
dean,” Schulman said. “There is a
very widespread feeling within the
faculty and at the higher levels of
the, administration that something
needs to be done.”

The scope and the nature of the
changes have yet to be determined.
They could be as .radical as in-
stituting new, fixed requirements
for the students. Or they could be

as conservative as making the
distribution of studies requirement
moreﬂspecific, Schulman said.

Schulman said that the 18
member faculty committee will
spend more than a year studying the
problem. The members were
chosen as people of stature within
the university community, and con-
cerned about undergraduate educa-
tion. They have taheir differences
but they all have the same interest in
improving the quality of education
here.

Schulman said we can upgrade or
widen the distribution of studies re-
quirement. “We need more
writing, natural science and
history,” he said. Half the students
here never take a literature or a
hisiorv course.” _

“We have to give the students
more guidance than they are get-
ting,” said Schulman. “But we
have a very departmentalized in-
stitution. We’re going to have to
learn to rise above individual
departments and thing of ourselves

as members of a college.”

“Actually, curriculum reform is
more important for the faculty than
the student body. There really isn’t
the sense of community that there
should be. The students will benefit
if the faculty has this sense of com-
munity,” said Schulman.

“It will be easy to have some
reform,” Schulman said. “But we
have higher ambitions, some new
kinds of curriculum should be

formed and we’ll have more cross- ’

departmental ties.”

Student Government President
Bill Abraham attended the Urban
13 Conference in Houston last
weekend for the first annual
meeting of student representatives
of member colleges and univer-
sities. \
' The Urban 13 has existed on a
more- informal basis for eight years,

- but this first student conference has

signaled the beginning of a more
permanent relationship between the
schools, Abraham said.

Vice Chancellors for Student Af-
fairs and Provosts from member

 

 

schools have been meeting twice a
year to help identify and solve pro-
blems inherent in the functioning of
large urban universities.

“Because of the demographic
similarities and the diverse student
populations that these universities

share we can pool our information

and help each other handle pro-
blems better,” Abraham said.
Susan Fratkin, the director of
special programs of the National
Association of State Universities
and Land Grant Colleges told the
Urban 13 representatives that there
will now be an urban division of
that organization with approx-

imately $2S million earmarked to
.1id urban universities.

Some of the problems addressed
at the conference were; taming
growing bureacracies, cutting back
administrative costs and program-
ming for diverse student popula-
tions, according to Abraham.

Abraham explained the need for
programming for non-traditional
students. Those who are older,
working, commuting or have
families.

“We need to have programming
for all of these types of people as
well as the 18-22 year old who lives
on campus. Something like the

Time To Grow Up.

There exists a need here at Pitt for a crash course in -

administrative diplomacy.

This assumption is true if Monday evening’s forum
with Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs Conney
Kimbo concerning the revamped residence hall
visitation policy is indicative of the general student
population. '

Resident students were concerned and rightly so,
over the possiblility of erasing a long standing right
to unlimited dorm visitation. The students strongly
believed-the proposal was drafted and eventually ap-
proved last Friday without sufficient student input‘.

Kimbo went’ to Monday’s meeting with the hopes

. of explaining the policy, its rationale and answering

questions posed the bythe students.

Instead, the obviously overzealous and frequently
rude members of the audience jeered Kimbo, barely
giving him the opportunity to complete two con-
secutive sentences. I

“We want the administration to get off its pedestal
and come down and see what the students want,”
one student said. .

. Unfortunately, the students attending the forum
Monday did not deserve the courtesy of being treated
as the mature young adults they so vehemently at-

' tested to being, adults who should be afforded the
- freedom to live in the residence halls according t_O

their rules. They forced the administration to stand
by the decision it believed best for students obviously
not capable or willing to make their own rational
decisions. _

The students’ display of emotional, often times
weak and baseless arguments would certaily deter
even the most tolerant of administrators from recon-
sidering an already approved policy decision.

One local newspaper said the forum turned fiasco
caused the “visibly dist_urbed administrator to walk
out of the meeting. ”' , _ _

Soviet Gov'i‘ -

By Josnpu C. HEIM _

The era of Leonid Brezhnev in
Soviet politics is coming to an end.
Brezhnev is physically in his
autumn years, to say the least.

Who will take his place is almost '
' anybody’s guess.

In fact, the
situation is much like a roulette
‘game, the analogy which ﬁrst
appeared a few years ago on a news
magazine cover, where any number

‘ can come up at any given time.

Likewise, the Soviet method of
leadership selection is played in
such a similar manner.

In the Fall 1979 issue of

“Foreign Affairs,” William Hy-A

land, in an article entitled,
“Brezhnev and Beyond” does a
very good analysis of all the

numbers on .the roulette table.
Importantly, he states that what we

may be witnessing is not a‘-

leadership change, but also a
generational change. The implica-
tions are especially profound.
The current generation of Soviet
leaders, including Brezhnev, are all
either in their-late sixties or early
seventies. -These Soviet leaders
underwent many of their formative
experiences in the 19305 and World
War II, and in the strong Cold War
years immediately following. The
newer
Soviet leadership has not had such
a formative experience. What this
might mean‘, according to some
Soviet experts, is that this younger
generation may be more willing to
argue for their need. to project

generation of emerging .

 

Soviet inﬂuence, perhaps less
cautiously than their elders. There
is a very real question of how this
generation of Soviet leadership
views the policy of detente.
Needless to say, detente is not
exactly a widely accepted policy in
many circles. Some, such as Jack
Anderson, have speculated that
those who favor confrontation over
detente may have taken the
initiative and gained the ascen-
dancy. .

Hedrick Smith, of the “New York
Times,” accurately, in my belief,
diagnosed when the Soviet leader-
ship is in a transition phase.
Smith's view is that during times of
transition in the Soviet leadership,
the armed forces and-'the security
forces, such as the KGB, gain

influence in Soviet policymaking.
Perhaps the current situation in
Afghanistan might be put into such
a framework, for if indeed we are in
a period of transition, and
Brezhnev is in the process of
relinquishing the reins, 'one might
see why the armed forces view did
“win the day.” This is especially
true if one subscribes to the fact
that from this Soviet view, the
Kremlin had little choice but to
back their falling client in Kabul.
The Afghanistan issue has become
a military concern to the Soviets,
and such influence in policymaking
concerning that area might be
extended to inﬂuencing the course
of succession, a much more
important concern than Afghani-
stan. Thus it will be interesting to

J

Wednesday, February,6, Arm Wrestling Tournament  
’ Towers.Lobby 3PM 50¢-entry fee

‘Taking Al Gamble With Russian Roulette

see if the Soviet military can extend
their inﬂuence in the succession
process. If they cannot determine
whothe successor will be, they will
at the minimum be able to
determine who the successor will
not be. This point is borne out by a
number of Soviet experts.

Thus, when we consider the
Soviet policy in Afghanistan, it is
perhaps best to view this policy

against the backdrop concerning“;

the succession of Brezhnev. This, I"
believe, will help to understand
how the Soviets are reacting. For in
the long run, who succeeds
Brezhnev is a matter of concern for
the United States.

As for me, I do not play roulette.“

However, it is‘ my belief that the ’

The whys and hows concerning
the University’s new visitation
policy are no longer important. The
policy is here and now must be
defeated. "

In the meeting Monday night,
Dr, Kimbo offered little insight into
the reasons for the change. He said

that in. part it was to bring Pitt more -

“in line” with other schools.
Which ones? Oral Roberts! He did
say numerous times that the board
Qﬁxgrustees had instructed him to
review policy.

Whatever _the trustees’ motiva-
tions, they were obviously counting
on apathy among the students to
get this through without much fuss.
However, they miscalculated. If
one thing is clear, it’s that the
students are mad. Clamn mad! The
reasonsare _o_l_)vious.

But the trusteesknow that if they
stand ﬁrm, usually student opposi-
tion fades away. We must be. sure
that doesn’t happhn in this case.
V This is the hard part. Yes,
students are united in their’
opposition to the new policy. But
no, they're not united on how to
defeat it.

On Monday night, one person

What is needed here is fast

on -the trustees. There are
numerous actions available to the
students to secure what they feel is

It is important that the students

it’s important for all students, not

‘concerns them. We must show the

trustees that this is not the way to

It was not our intention to imply
a distinction between “the men's
team representing ‘Pitt’. .when
playing basketball” and the wo-
men’s team being “just a- bunch of
‘girls’ playing a game,” as she put
it. In what were mainly space and
typesetting considerations, the
chosen phrasing seemed, at the
time,Ito be a short, concise and
accurate explanation of pro-
gramming for that particular
evening. Due to this apparent
misinterpretation, however, we will
be more cautious in the future in
wording such announcements,
hopefully avoiding any further
‘confusion.’

The point that is being grossly
overlooked by Ms. Eisensmith is

what WPGH Radio is actually_

doing to support women’s athletics
here at the university. Our sports

director, Jonathan Whaley, andphis _

staff have taken great strides in
covering the women’s teams, as
well-as’ the men’s. -

In fact, our coverage is more
extensive than many other college
radio station’s, and certainly more
than the local media's. Play-by-
play broadcast of a women’s
basketball game at all is unique
and rare in itself. If listener support
is evident, more games can be
broadcasted in the future.

Our weekly sports talk show,

“Right On The Pulse Of Sports,” . .

has devoted many hours of
programming to women’s sports at

Pitt and frequently has guests from_

the various female athletic squads.

' Even the color comentators for the
‘plav-by-plav of both games that
- particular evening were both fe-

question, “Must a Pitt athlete

Neverson was Pitt’s point guard
Monday, a role in which he doesn’t
feel _too comfortable, but out of
necessity had to assume.

“I’m just an average point
guard,” he said. Regular point
guard Dwayne Wallace is still on

against St. Francis over a week

The Panthers took a 2-0 lead on a
goal by right wing Tom Robinson.
He was assisted by defenseman
Verne Shaver and left wing Brian
Morgangthe ﬁrst of two assists for
him. Robinson's goal lifted his
season’s total to eight, second best
on the team.

At 10:17 of the period, Ziegler
scored his second goal as he beat
CMU goalie Dave Tozer to the right
of the net. The assist went to
defenseman Jim Kirsch as the
Panthers expanded their lead to
3-0.

However, 14 seconds later, CMU
scored their ﬁrst goal on a shot by
Damon Burke. It was only one of a
handful of chances that the Tartans
had all afternoon.

Pitt coach Greg Stein felt good.

about the play of his team.

“I thought everyone did a real
good job, especially the non-star-
ters,” he said. “I was pleased with
their skating and all-around play.”

Within a time span of 1:09 at the
end of the period, three more goals
were scored. Center Fred 'Erny
scored his first of two goals,

Burke ﬁnished CMU’s scoring

Ken Greb had wandered a bit too
far from his net and couldn’t

play (Burke's second goal) was his
only mistake of the game.”

ATHENS, Greece-—Amid ‘con-
troversy over the Moscow Olym-
pics, Premier Constantine Cara-
manlis has formally. renewed his
call for the Olympic Games to be
permanently based" in Greece. He
stressed thathis proposal was not
dictated by nationalist or proﬁt-
seeking motives.

In a letter to Lord Killanin,
president of the International

Olympic Committee, made public-

Saturday, the premier proposed
ancient Olympia, where the games
originated, as the permanent hom
for the Olympics. '
He said that his ‘proposal “is
aimed at protecting the Olympic

   

ideal which is linked to Greek
tradition and to the Greek spirit
and towards which it is natural for
the Greek people to feel particular-
ly sensitive.”

The premier’s Jan. 28 letter was
sent after the United States
suggested a boycott of the Moscow
Olympics this summer if Soviet
troops are not removed from
Afghanistan. '

Greece has announcedthat it will
send its athletes to Moscow, saying
that it does not want to mix politics
with sports. _ .

Caramanlis’s letter referred _to
his original proposal sent to the

   la‘ 1. pr 5. saw 14.2.". at.» .~.>'aq.lr 9-

four_ years ago‘ stating .that Greece
is the most suitable site to be the‘
permanent site for the games.
“Political, racial and ideological
conﬂicts are rekindled every time
the choice of a site for the‘ games
arises, as at present, with the
games planned for Moscow,”
Caramanlis said, adding; “The
Olympic idea...has become a
means of political rivalry and
economic aspirations.” ,
He said disputes provoked

Freshmen Welsh, Miklasevich Power Panthere

By MARIE HUFF

At the beginning of this season,
Coach Jean Balthaser remarked
that the success her basketball
Pantherettes would depend greatly
on the freshman. “They
will have to adjust and mature very
quickly.” said Balthaser.

Well, the Pantherettes now sport
a 17-8 record, and are well on the

way to their best season ever.

Much of that success can be
attributed to Pam Miklasevich and
Penny Welsh.

Welsh, who says her father

A tezjght her everything she knows

about basketball, came to Pitt from
Wilmington, Delaware. She led
her team to the Delaware State
championship last year, averaging
23.3 points and ..18.2 rebounds
per game for the season. Among
the honors she collected during
that year were first team all-State,
all-Catholic and 1978-79 Delaware-
Player-of-the-Year.

However, Welsh says that is all
in the past. The switch from high
school to college basketball meant
a switch of positions.

“It was quite a difference to
adjust to.” says Welsh. “instead

/\ of playing the inside game, I have

‘to make more cuts and break to the
outside.”

Welsh to swish the nets from just
about any place on the court,
instead of just the baseline. On the
year, Welsh has accumulated 356
points for a 14.2 average. She has
also managed to haul down 210
rebounds for an 8.4 average.
Offense is not the only aspect of the
game in which Welsh excels.

“Penny’s defensive game is just
as good as her offensive,” said
Balthaser. Indeed, Welsh harras-
ses her opponents often. The
result has been 37 thefts thus far,
and she has yet to foul out of a
game."

Welsh started out the year by
earning all-Toumey honors at the
Cincinnati Classic. Since then, she
has consistently been scoring in
double-digit figures for the Pan-
therettes.

Welsh’s cohort, Pam Miklase-
vich, a six-foot forward Murrys-
ville, also led her high school team
to a state championship ‘last year.
Averaging 20 points and 14
rebounds per game, Miklasevich
amassed a huge list of honors,
including all-State, all-Area and
all-Section. a

The consistency of Miklasevich,
along with her even-tempered
personality, has enabled her to hurt
teams time and time again.

“Most coaches notice height,
and then they notice whoever is

shooting well at the time,” said
Balthaser. “With Pam, she is so
consistent throughout the game,
she almost goes unnoticed.”

How anyone could not notice
Miklasevich is a mystery. She
commands a variety of moves,
aided by her ability to shoot with
either hand. . Currently, she has
pumped in 419 points, one less
than team leader Debbie Lewis.
_She has also hit on 89-of-99 free
throws, ranking her tenth in the
nation.

The Pantherettes are a defense-
oriented team and Miklasevich fits
nicely into the scheme. Re-
bounding is her strongest defens-
ive point, as she leads the team
with 296, for an 11.8 average. '

Miklasevich earned Most Valu-
able Player honors at the Pitt
Invitational and has also put her
name in the record books for tying
the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse scoring
record of 31 points, a feat she did
against Syracuse.

These are all impressive sta-
tistics, and Balthaser said that

Welsh and Miklasevich are im-'

provingeach game. Improvement
always pleases a coach, but team
players please a‘ coach even more.
Balthaser definitely has two team
players in Welsh and Miklasevich.
Both girls stressed the fact that Pitt
is comprised of team players and
not individuals.

It is safe to say that Welsh and
Miklasevich have adjusted and
matured. And if basketball players
can get better with time, as Win
does, then the future looks brigh
for Welsh, Miklasevich and th
Pantherettes.

Penny Welsh has teamed with Pam Miklasevich to give , .

the Pantherettes an effective freshman scoring duo.

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Pitt News Staff Writer

For those of you who thought
that Sammie Ellis had taken a
permanent leave of absence from
his scoring duties. think again. The
senior from Georgia, after a few
“off” nights, has resumed his
scoring onslaught and once again
can be found in the familiar
position of leading scorer of the
game. Monday night against a
tough Eastern Kentucky team,
Ellis led all Pitt scorers with 25
paints and fell a bucket and a free
throw short from taking game
honors.

After sub par performances
against Duke and St. Francis, fans
were writing Ellis off as a “choke,”
but these accusations were not well
based. . .

“I don’t think I was in a slump,
the ball was just not falling in,”
said Ellis after the game. “I was
still playing hard, after all there is

still more to basketball than just
putting the ball in the hoop.”

With the loss of point
guard Dwayne Wallace, the
Panthers must rely on Ellis more
and he has responded. The Eastern
Kentucky game was a good
example of this. "With Carlton
Neverson playing point guard the
Panthers are not the same. Not to
downgrade Neverson, who has
been Pitt’s most consistent perfor-
mer this year, but he is just not a
point guard. Neverson himself
admitted that he loses some of this
effectiveness along with his new
ballhandling duties.

Monday night, the Panthers did
not look very cohesive and
sometimes "looked very confused.
When a team is not playing well

and needs a basket it usually turns»

to its best player to let him do his
“thing.” On Monday night Sam-
mie Ellis did "his thing.

Time, after time when Pitt

needed a basket, Ellis responded
with strong inside moves and
clutch outside shooting. The senior
was deadly from the floor as he hit
on 10 of 15 shots.

“We didn't play tOO well and I
wanted the ball. Down the stretch
you’ve got to want the ball,” said
Ellis. “That’s where the game is
won or lost. I was getting real good
position out there and my shots
were falling.” 1 _

The Panthers, after an exhai1’it-
ing two_weeks, can look forward to
a rest before taking» on Duquesne
Sunday. Ellis feels the rest "is
neededfor the team.

“We’re all sick,” he said. “I’ve
been coughing all week, and
everybody is really tired. We’ll be
ready to play on Sunday, but for the
meantime I just" want to relax for a.
couple of days.” I

Come Sunday afternoon, chances
are that Sammie Ellis will once
again be ready to do his thing.

A local T.V. sports anchorman,

known for his sarcastic tongue,
recently stated that the only thing
worse than going to Cleveland was
going to Cleveland in a bus. Sounds
pretty tough to top, huh? Well,
how about going to Cleveland in a
bus and losing a wrestling match.
Kind of makes you feel happy you
stayed home and watched the
Superstars and that Tarzan movie
doesn’t it?
"“'.'Unfortunately, that’s the way
last Sunday went for the Panthers,
as they experienced a 27-13 loss to
the Vikings of Cleveland State. It
would be hard to imagine a" bright
side to the defeat, but head coach
Rande Stottlemyer did see some
positive points tied to the Cleve-
land State loss.

“I saw a deﬁnite improvement
from Thursday night,” said Stottle-
myer. “We were sluggish against

there’s been a gradual
ment since then. '

“We were a lot better against
Lock Haven Saturday, (a 18-18
draw) and we continued to improve
at Cleveland State,” the coach
said. Cleveland State was just a
very good wrestling

As usual, things started out on
the upnote for the Panthers as
118-pounder Glenn Maxwell (12-7)
dusted off Dan Eckel to win his
match 9-5.

However, the next two wrestlers,
126 lb. Bill Clark and 134-pounder
Glenn Nacion, ran smack into a
very formidable Cleveland State
brother act——the Foldesy’s. First,
the lighter Dan Foldesy defeated
Clark by the score of 15-9, then Don
took care of the encore as he

‘~ polished off Nacion by a 12-3 count
to give the Vikings a 7-3 lead,

State’s Bill Walsh defeated Jeff
Gordon 11-2, then Dennis Rogan
bested Mike Bond by the score of
14-5 followed by a 8-1 victory by
Matt Dulka over Eric Harris at 158
lbs.

Wayne Lawrence sparked the
hope of a Pitt comeback with a 14-4
super decision over the Viking’s
Jim Markley. The victory by
Lawrence did not go unnoticed by
the Panther head coach.

"I saw things happening,” said
Stottlemyer, “and the good thing
about them was that they were
coming from our_y0ung kids.”

“These were the guys that were
supposed to be inexperienced, but
they showed me a tre_mendous
improvement,” he added.

The ﬂame died out quickly
though, as Cleveland State’s Ron
Varga pinned Jeff Wilps at 1:26 of
the first period and 190 lb. Kurt
Kuranovich lost yet another close
match 5-2, at the hands of Pete
Sandrev.

THE PHI DELTA THETA Experience is
WORTH the effort. If you never ex-
perience it, you'll never know what it

, is like - JOIN US! The Phi Delt Brothers.

Starting in 776 B.C., the games

at ancient Olympia were held every’

four years. The games temporarily
brought a halt to all hostilities
between warring Greek city states.
The last known Olympic games of

.\ antiquity were held in 393 A.D.

They were revived in 1896 and held
in Athens at the initiative of Pierre
de Courbetin of France.

However, the city, located 200
miles southwest of Athens, has
