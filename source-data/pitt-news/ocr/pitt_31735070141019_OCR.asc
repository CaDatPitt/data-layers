PPC director calls all shots

by Drew Singer
Newd Editor

J] Abbott is one of the richest
students on campus.

His money doesn’t come from
his mom and dad, and although he
works hard, he gets paid pennies
‘by the hour.

But this year, J] Abbott has
$765,500 of your money. And he’s,

spending it all. ,

‘‘It’s an awesome responsibil-
ity,” said the executive director
of the Pitt Program Council, the
student group responsible for
planning most of Pitt's student ac-
tivities. “It’s not something I take
lightly. It’s cool to have a big say in
calling the shots_;’’ 0

More than 15,000 Pitt students

depend on Abbott, a senior mar-
keting major in _the College of
Business Administration, to throw
the best year—long party he can, But

'Pitt’s program council is unique

among universities.

“To the best of my knowledge,
in this region, we’re the only pro?
gramming board that can make
decisions,” said Abbott. “I don’t
think students here realize they
have that power.”

‘ This year, when the Student
Government Board increased the
program council’s funding by more
than $25,000,‘ Abbott allocated ev-
ery penny of. it toward lecturers.

_ In all, the program council
dedicated $127,873 to lectures this
year. This includes $25,000 each for
comedian Mo Rocca and former

Playboy bunny Bridget Marquardt
and a $30,000 check cut to Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s former cam-

‘ paign manager David Plouffe, who

lectured at Pitt Monday night.
About 350 students attended
Plouffe’s lecture, Abbott said.
Because the cost of lecturers
is high compared to other events
—— PPC usually pays more than
$50 per student attending a lecture,
while more common events such
as cooking lessons cost about $10
per student. PPC paid about $85
per attendee at the Plouffe lecture.

prised by this ﬁgure. ,

the campaign closely, then the lec-
ture was a bit of a waste.”

Director: Attendance figures not a good gauge

PPC, page 1

While some people might not
frequent PPC lectures if they had
to pay out of pocket, the long—used
process of using SGB funding to
let everyone split the tab encour-
ages many more to attend.

“I wouldn’t have paid to go, but
that’s the great thing about PPC,”
said Pitt student Rachel Swartz, “I
can go for free.”

Pitt is_ one of the last program
boards in the country that focuses
on lectures, said Abbott.

“The reality is that entertain-
ment costs are high for people
who are popular,” said assistant
director of Student Life Tom Mi-
suraca. “Unlike other things, the
market’s always going up.”

While Misuraca serves as the
program council’s adviser, he has
no ﬁnal say in the decisions the
program council makes. While
each committee within PPC has
a chairperson, Abbott maintains
veto power.

Neither does SGB, which gives
nearly one—third of its annual
budget — funded by students’

semesterly activities fees — to the
program council without requiring
reports until the end of the school
year.

Dean of students Kathy Hum-
phrey, who signs off on program
council contracts only to safeguard
from legal issues, said she has never
blocked a program council project
since she took office in 2005.

“As an authority of deciding,
‘This person can come and this
person can’t,’ I try to stay out of
that,’” she said. “I’ve never deter-

mined that a speaker can or cannot’

come.”

Humphrey isn’t the only Pitt
administrator who trusts the pro-
gram council to spend wisely.

“Our philosophy is to give
students autonomy,” said Kenyon
Bonner, director of Student Life.
“I try to make as few decisions
as possible in terms of their pro-
gramming.”

But are the costs of bringing
popular lecturers to campus worth
the benefits to students?

“That’s a. legitimate question,

and it’s a question best answered
by the students,” said Bonner.
“I think students should look at
whether or not the money spent

    

\. , ,
I Vaughn Walle / Staff hotographer
JJ Abbott
by their student leaders is being
used right.”

The numbers aren’t the only
way to judge a lecturer’s worth,
said Abbott.

Misuraca agreed, saying there’s
a value to meeting news makers in
person.

“I think its every bit as irnpres—
sive bringing in a David Plouffe

and a Karl Rove than a big rock
band,” he said. .

“Some people think Rove is the
devil, but you had an opportunity
to meet the devil face to face and
ask him questions. You had more
than just sound bites and news re-
ports.”

PPC requires that all lectures
have a minimum half—hour ques-
tion—and—answer session with stu-
dents. And some lecturers partake
in additional events while in Oak-
land.

Monday afternoon, Plouffe
spoke with about 100 political sci-
ence students on a more technical
level than his evening lecture, said
Abbott.

While Abbott has had the final
decision about who visits campus
this year, he said his primary source
of student feedback for picking

lecturers is a committee of about

10 students. Anyone may join the I

committee.

He plans on meeting with this
committee one or two more times.

executive director is up.
“The more you’re involved,”
said Abbott, “The more of a role

‘you play in determining how your

money is used.” ,

Abbott added that he also uses
attendance at lectures as feedback.
Because of limited campus venues
with the necessary acoustics and
backstage space, PPC lectures are
almost exclusively held in the WH-
liam Pitt Union Assembly Room,
which has a maximum capacity of
500 people.

“It’s not really ideal for us,” said
Abbott. “If the unior1 had a 1,000
person room, we’d book it.”

But, “To be honest, I don’t
know that many times where we’ve
turned down that many people,”
he added. _

Like all of his expenditures,
however, Abbott defends his de-
cision to bring in lecturers as just
adding to the year-long PPC party.

“\X/ithout [PPC lectures], there’s
no one else who’s going to pick up
the slack for that,” said Abbott.

“There would be a hole there.”

 PPGilshould overhauliiiits 

executive's privileges

It cost $30,000 to bring David
Plouffe to Pitt, $25,000 for Mo
Rocca to speak here and another
$25,000 for Bridget Marquardt.
But no administrator made the
choice to have these speakers. It
was an entirely student—led deci-
sion, but the problem is that just
one student made the decision:
Pitt senior Abbott.

\X/ithin the last year,Abbott
has decided how to spend the
$765,500 that Student Govern-
ment Board allocated to the Pitt
Program. Council more or less
single-handedly. This includes
almost $127,000 that PPC has
dedicated to lecturers this year.
A single $30,000 lecture would
mean almost $60 per ticket for
students who attended.

The money comes out of the
$80—per—semester - undergradu-
ate activities fee, which SGB al-
locates to student groups every
year. And while SGB has made

_ some questionable allocations ‘in

the past, it has at least overseen
the decisions. ’ ‘
But PPC operates by a differ-
ent code: The executive ‘direc-
tor has full authority to spend

' the -money how he pleases. He

just needs one administrator
—— Kathy Humphrey, the dean
of students —— to approve the
speakers. ' ‘ I

This system obviously -has
a ﬂaw, but Pitt has no problem
with handing nearly three quar-
ters of $1 million of students’
money to a single undergraduate
student leader so he can distrib-
ute it as he pleases — on any-
thing from rock concerts to Karl
Rove. . A

This isn’t to say that Abbott
hasn_’t clone a’ good job during
his tenure. For the most part, it
appears as though he makes de-

cisions with a variety of student’
‘ input and that he’s generally re-
‘ sponsible with the money. But if

a less scrupulous or less respon-
sible person headed the PPC, it
would only serve to highlight the
glaring flaw in the system, which
is now only covered by Abbott’s
competence. '

And the current system at

least gives agency to students 2

themselves rather than placing
the decisions in the hands of ad-
ministrators. It’s better that we as
students have a chance to decide

how our money is spent our— ‘
selves, even if it is through PPC’s i

own decision—making process.

Ultimately, we have ‘little E
problem with the fact that PPC 
chooses to spend the-money as ?

it does, although‘ we would like

more student input on decisions, ;
like which speakers to choose for '

lectures or which bands might

dent at Pitt could theoretically go
to PPC’s meetings and give his

input, so _it’s hardly the council’s E

fault if students don’t.
It’s a problem that the ulti-

mate authority still rests in the 
hands of PPC’s executive direc- 
tor. Students have no power to _
inﬂuence the ﬁnal decision pro-’

cess, even though it’s their mon-
ey being spent.

Students could possibly elect :
the next PPC director democrat- 
ically or even institute a board of 
executives who make decisions 

concurrently. But any change to

the executive directorship would 
have to retain the ability to make 

quick decisions and a smooth
turnaroun_d —— something im-

plicitly offered by a single stu— 
dent leader acting as a decider.

6’ It’s fair, to say that PPC does a

ood 'ob re resentin the inter-: 
g ._._l V j g _ .

ests of students and attempting
to be responsive .to;their~desires.
But the factthatPPC’s leadership
structure exists in a state almost
completely absent of oversight
causes deep concern. ,

I can only hope that last sen-

tence was said in a similar in a_

similar tone as “The Highlander”

Jindal, another 2012 presiden-

tial contender — what a coinci-

‘ dence —— agreed that, “I think we

just have a fundamental disagree-
ment here.

“I don’t think the best way to
[help Louisiana] is for the gov-

ernment to tax and borrow more

money,” he said on NBC’s “Meet
the Press.” I 
The "more plausible explana-
tion for the rejectionof funds,
of course, is simply that southern
governors feel._they most appeal
to_ a _traditionally ﬁsc’ally‘_conser-

‘ vative‘ base. Because come elec-
' tion time, their overplayed com-

mercials will say something" like,

V “Bobby Jindal; A manof. princi-

ple. A man who couldtnot be led
astray by the left-wing temptress.
A man of the people. When 42
other governors followed Presi-
dent Barack Obama blindly, Bob-

by jindal said, ‘No,”’ followed by
a pensive picture of Jindal on a
New Orleans harbor.

As if to amplify this division,
stick-to-their—values, back-to-
basics conservatives, even insig-
niﬂcant ones, have been talking
about these -very differences ev-
ery chance they get.

Son of former Florida Gov.
jeb Bush, George P. Bush , -—-
who I will refer ,to simply as “P”
— calls these others “D light,”
which frankly sounds more like a
beer brand or a prostitute to me,
but ‘A’ for effort.

I canionly imagine what the
southern conservatives said

about Florida Gov. Charlie Crist

. after this little comment: “There

is a national leader, his name is
President Obama.” Teacher’s pet,
probably. ’

Along with Crist, California

Gov. Arnold n Schwarzenegger g

was one of the few Republican
governors who openly endorsed
Obama’s stimulus plan, because
he just wants to do what’s best
for ‘ Kauli—for-nya. Schwarzeneg-

ger told ABC’s “This Week,” “I.
am more than happy to take his’

money or [that of] any other gov-
ernor in this country’ that doesn’t

Want to take this money. I take it A

because I think California needs it.” I-Ia.
'I'hat’s the understatement of the year, con-
sidering the state of California’s economy.

I would like to say that D lights, like
Crist and Schwarzenegger, really are act-
ing out of the selﬂessness of their hearts,
but the factis their decision is as politically
motivated as Sanford’s or ]indal’s. They are
just hedging their bets that the stimulus
plan succeeds.

It’s what I love so much about politi-
cians. They always try to improve their own
standing by stepping on the neatly polished
shoes of their peers.

So what happens when you get 50 feud-
ing governors together? Obarna, lucky
chap that he is, got to experience just that
at the White House Sunday and Monday
for the annual winter meeting of the Na-
tional Governors Association.

’ Sunday’s dinner, I can only imagine, was
much like a high school cafeteria, except
filled with old; rich guys and a few old, rich

women dressed in power suits and Tina-

Fey glasses (I love drawing Sarah Palin ref-
erences out of the depths of irrelevancy),

‘while Obama patrolled the table like beat-

en-down and ignored principal muttering
things like, “bipartisanship” and,‘ “Listen,
it’s only 3 percent of the plan.”

The southern conservatives on one end
of the table, Democrats at the other and
an awkward cluster of D lights (I just can’t
get enough of that term) in the-_ middle
— the Republicans don’t want them, the

Democrats don’t want them, nobody wants ..

them.
Crist walks over to his old chum San-
ford, his eye on an empty seat. A beat, then

2‘Sorry, Charlie — you can’t sit. with
us!”

In the end, I suspect all the governors
will accept the stimulus money —— let’s face
it, the states need it. I think it’s just a mat-
ter of who holds out the longest, defames
the others the most and, ultimately, smack
talks his way into a potential presidential
election.

LETTERSTOTHEEDITOR

To the Editor,

On behalf of the Pittsburgh Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, I extend my gratitude
to the University of Pittsburgh student body for your remarkable support of Pink the Petersen on
Saturday, Feb. 21. To see the Panthers in their pink uniforms and the sea of pink created by the

, Oakland Zoo spoke volumes about your commitment to the ﬁght against breast cancer.

Because of you, the Komen Pittsburgh Afﬁliate will be better able to help the women and men
of our region whose lives are affected by breast cancer. Money raised from Pink the Petersen will
fund education, screening, research and treatment programs in our area, including the Mammo-
gram Voucher Program that provides mammograms to under-insured and uninsured members
of the community. We hope to see you at the Race for the Cure in Schenley Park on Mother’s Day,
May 10!

Kathy Purcell, executive director

however, any less predictable.

Sometimes, though, a win is

the house this year, its many wins
were indicative of the shifting tides

lucky, its award ceremonies.

Say Hi to single-syllable songs

by Alison Smyth
Staﬁf Writer

OoHs & AAHS
SAY HI

Label: Barsuk Records
Rocks Like: Belle & Sebastian, Someone Still
Loves You Boris Yeltsin
Local Show: March 31 at Garfield Artworks

Say Hi takes
on a theme well
traveled in the
rock genre -
songs about a
giii The idea
of songs with
' ’ names

C is usu-
ally enough to
make you skip the
sap-ﬁlled gushfest that s you’d expect,
but Say Hi makes the concept bearable, even
catchy.

The  are all there: Eloise, Hallie, Maurine,
Audrey, Sallie and a few unnamed subjects, and
Say Hi tells you all about them in its sixth release,
Oohs & Aahs 4

Say Hi, called Say Hi to Your Mom until the
release of last year’s The Wishes and the Glitch,
was known for supernaturally infused lyrics and
references to Joss Whedon characters The band
had futuristic blips to back up its tales of the ro-
bots to come. Therewas a darker edge, a constant
mood of the electronically fueled beat.

Oohs & Aahs takes a different approach.

That is, different for Say Hi, but not something
I revolutionary in the world of rock. The songs are

entertaining to be sure, but there is no shortage
of songs with gitis’ names.

It’s the  tribute with littie doses of
brass instruments amid the guitar that brings to

. mind Someone Still Love You Boris Yeltsin You

cantaketheneed

and a lighter style. The old style comes out in little
ﬂares, but you’ll hardly miss it while you’re listen-
ing to the monosyllabic choruses, singing along
with the infectious “Get ‘em. / Uh huh huh” of
“Dramatic Irony” or the “Oh” of “Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh.”

Unfortunate name aside, “Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh O ” deserves to be
put on repeat and listened to at least as
many times as they use the word “Oh.”

The random brass doesn’t really make
sense, other than to announce the roy-
ally entertaining notes to come There’s a
guitar and bass to spare, all with a cool de-
livery that knits the upbeat with the low key.

Of course, it is about a  but the 
makes the track worthwhile The words are a little
strange, describing her as having “lips like a sofa”
and saying, “If the devilwas agirl, and shewore a
yellowT, / Itwould be a spittingimage”

Oh, this song is catchy. Plus, you only have to
learnonewordtosingalongwiththechorusBonus

The single—word chorus is reminiscent of
tracks ﬁotn The Wishes and Glitch, but replacing

. our favorite angst—1idden creatures of the night

with slightly less—interesting, yet classic, subject of
girls It’s a safe road. Generally, when your track
 sound like the roster of the Zac Eﬁon
Fan Club, the outlook is not good

Luckily, “Eloise” is a D] and in a Seattle indie

in a way ]acl<man’s stiff and stuffy salute to
musicals couldn’t. After all, not a single mu-
sical was nominated for  this year
— how “back” can they be? Still, it’s hard
not to watch this ceremony, romantically

something other than welhpaidentertainers
congratulating each other for how wonderful
they all are. .
It’s possible that after last year’s “No
Country for Old Men,” the many “Slumdog”

wins will continue to legitimize independent
ﬁlmmaking and the use of unknown or un-
derappreciated talent. It’s possible that the
equality—espousing speeches of Sean Penn

people other than the predictably liberal au-
dience in the Kodak

one just went through the motions for an-
other year, from the political grand—standing
to the host’s tiresome antics. That we can all

Oscar. That maybe the cynics are right, and
to anyone but the winners and losers, it just
doesn’t mean  at all.

team, has brought good luck with his pre-game dancing this'year.

Rivers dances into bigger role

by Alex Oltmanns
Staff Whiter

A lot of Pitt basketball fans have
asked the question, ‘7Who is that kid
  the team huddle before
games?” i

The answer is student manager
Nick Rivers, and he was a standout
basketball player at Brophy. Col-
lege Preparatory in Arizona where
he played in  school and AAU
games against players likejerryd Bay-
less of the Portland Trail Blazers and
Taylor°King. of Villanova. He wasn’t
able -to continue his career to the col-
legiate level, and he came to Pitt last
yearin a different capacity. -

“I decided to be a manager to_ stay
around the game,” he said. “I wanted

- to be a part of something.”

Rivers, a sophomore, does all the
same tasks as the other student man-
agers for the basketball team. He sets

"up for practice, cuts up ﬁuit duting

the games and does anything and ev-
erything that the coaches need.

But there’s one area of Rivers’ job
that is unique from the other man-
agers: He performs the pre-game
dance. His routine, while it’s never

quite the same, is a blend of hip—hop

and break  inspired by his
“West Coast roots. . ‘

Now a ritual at every home game,
"his  started .off in the locker
room. According to Rivers, the play-
ers often do dances there when a
good beat comes on, so he joined in.

“One dayI just started dancinggto
E-40’s song ‘Tell Me When To Go,’
and all the players were laughing, and
Levance [Fields] saidl should do that
before the games,” he said.

At ﬁrst Rivers was skeptical, as he
didn’t want to take any of the spot-
light away from the players But he
ﬁnally agreed.

“I just stepped to the plateand
had fun with it,” he said i

managers are for the team.
along with many other workers be-
hind the scenes, often go unnoticed.

“We wanted to give the managers
the chance to show how much they
really contribute to us winning,” said
Woodaﬂ.

' While many pre-game huddles are

aimed at getting the players pumped
up, Rivers has taken a different ap-
proach to keep the players loose be-
fore the game

“I tryto do ﬁinny moves to  *

the players laugh and make them real-
ize that basketball is a fun game,” said
Rivers. “It can be really tense before
the game having all the pressure on
you from the coaches and the fans”

Not only does Rivers try to help
out the players with his dances before
the game, but he also looks to get ev-
eryone else in the building involved
as well.

“Nick’s an entertaining guy,” said
Pitt junior guard Jermaine Dixon.
“He gets the crowd into it, and he
gets us into it big time.”

But for future games, don’t just,

expect the same dance out of Rivers.

“I have to keep it new and catch
them off guard,” he said.

His dance could turninto a yearly
tradition, as the Panthers are unbeat-
en in games when Nick steps into the
huddle to keep them going

And approaching tournament
play, he’s hoping to be Pitt’s source of

‘ goodluck.

Davis, Providence look to

knock down No. l Panthers

Now coaching at Providence, Davis has
led the Friars to 16-11 overall and 8-7 in the
-Big East. On Tuesday night, they’ll host No.
1 Pitt (25-2, 12-2 Big East) at 7 p.m. in Provi-
dence. , * _ ’

Davis said that while the team always stays
positive, it’s never easy to host a No. 1 team.

“It would be a huge victory if we were
somehow able to pull the upset,” said Davis.

‘ Providence lost to Notre Dame — a team
that has struggled this season — 103-84 on
Saturday afternoon. It was the Friars’ second
defeat in a row. Louisville beat them 94-76
the game before that. ‘

“W/e got a chance to see ﬁrsthand why
a lot of people predicted or picked Notre
Dame to be a top—1O team in the country,”
said Davis. He added that Providence caught
the Fighting Irish at the wrong time, as Notre
Dame had recently defeated No. 7 Louisville
by 33 points.

The play of sophomore forward Dejuan
Blair has led the Panthers recently. Since‘ a
seven-point effort in a loss to Villanova, Blair
has averaged 20.3 points and 14.4'rebounds

per game.

“I don’t see any way to be able to stop"

him,” said Davis.

While Blair and the Panthers are almost
ensured a high NCAA Tournament seed,
Providence is a bubble team in need of
marquee wins for their Selection Sunday re-
sume.

In Big East play, Providence has gone 7-2 1

against the lower half of the conference, but
has only a 100-94 win against then No. 15
Syracuse against the upper half.

“It doesn’t get any easier for us, having
arguably the best team in the country coming

' in,” said Davis. “I think we need to just try to
' focus on improving a little bit: each game as

the conference tournament comes down.”

Davis’ coaching career has focused on
player improvement, and he’s helped sev-
eral players improve this season. Providence
senior guard Weyinmi Efejuku has thrived
despite his team’s recent struggles, setting
a Providence season‘-best with 31 points
against Notre Dame.

“He’s_ really been probably our most con-

‘ sistent player .this season, deﬁnitely,” said

Davis. “Offensively,' he’s been able to be a
consistent 3-point threat for us,~but he also
is able to take you off the dnbble and create

1 when you take his shot away.”

Providence last faced a No. 1 team three
years ago, when top-ranked Connecticut
defeated the ‘Friars 76-62. Davis has never

faced a No. 1 team in his two years as a head _

coach.
