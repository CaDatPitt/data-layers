(Author's Note: As the Pitt News
seems determined to overstep the
bounds of journalistic ethics and
present only a controlled and highly
biased report to the student body
for consuption, I feel I must attempt
to present our side of the story. I
had asked for equal‘ time in Mon-
day's edition, and I was denied
that right. I asked again for space
in today's Pitt News and I was un-
derstood to believe that no space
was available until Friday. Finally
at around lO:30 p.m., the staff re-
lented and gave me one hour to
present them excerpts from our of-
ficial statement.

(Now we realize that it is diffi-
cult to be totally objective in ct po-
litical situation, but I had hoped for
fairness. I am still hoping. ldid real-
ize that when you base a large part
of your campaign against the fail-
ures of nearly all of the campus
“biggies,” as Steve Cundra did,
you are not going to have an easy
time of it.

(I assumed the battle would be
waged on factual grounds, I know
now that Scott Baum, who doubles
as Elections Committee chairman,
and those who surround him, had
no intention of doing this. All
through both campaigns, Steve
Cundra condemned the petty po-
litics and cliquish nepotism on this
campus. He still condemns it. The
charges lodged against him hold no
more water than a paper seive. The
persons who lodged them have pri-
vately admitted as much.

(I hope that this issue can be
quickly resolved so that we may be-
gin to work on the problems which
have plagued this campus for the
last two years. Following are some

}excerpts from our official appeal

statement:)

On February 5. 1970. the Stu-
dent Government Election Com-
mittee decided in a five to two
vote to disqualify Steve Cundra.
President—Elect , of Student Gov-
ernment. from accepting his right-
ful seat as President of Student
Government. On Wednesday. Feb-
ruary 4. 1970. Steve Cundra had
defeated Harris Miller for the of-
fice of President of Student Gov-
ernment by "a 33 vote plurality.
From a strictly legal sense. the
SGEC cannot disqualify any per-
son who has been elected to an of-
fice. As President-Elect . Steve
Cundra is no longer merely a can-
didate. but a duly elected official.
Since this is the case. the SGEC
must deny him his seat rather
than disqualifying him.

«In arriving at their decision to
deny Steve Cundra his seat. the
SGEC used thefollowing ration-
ale: Steve Cundra has been cen-
sured in the first election for an
over-expenditure of forty dollars
above the two hundred dollar lim-
it and once again in the second
election for not removing all print-
ed material from the first election
that still remained posted on Uni-
versity property.

(The only legal means of re-
moving a Student Government of-

 

ficer of officer-elect is based up-
on his qualifications as set forth
in the Student Government Consti-
tution and the Student Govern-
ment By-Laws. Once a Student
Government officer is elected. the
only mechanism which can be util-
ized to remove or replace him is
the Constitution and its By-Laws.

«Removal can only be exercis-
ed through the legal Student Gov-
ernment structure. The SGEC act-
ed without this authority.

(The provision of the Election
Code which states that a candidate
can be denied his seat once he is
elected is unconstitutional. In its
statement of policy. the SGEC
states that certain national and
state election rules set precedent
for its procedure. Many national
and state precedents exists con-
cerning the seating of elected of-
ficials. The most famous prece-
dent was the Supreme Court rul-
ing several years ago in the case
the United States vs. Adam Clay-
ton Powell. It was in this case that
the Court ruled that any person
that is elected to office must be
seated. It is at that time that he
can be questioned through the leg-
al means established by the body
that he has been seated on.

(In the case of the President
and or Vice—Presidents is unable
to complete his term of office. the
Senate shall fill the vacancies.

Thus. the SGEC cannot select a
new President and Vice—President
if it refuses to seat the duly elect-
ed President and Vice-President:
this duty clearly falls into the
newly elected Senate. I have thus
demonstrated that the SGEC has
acted unconstitutionally and ca-
priciously in its decision to pre-
vent Steve Cundra from assuming
the seat which he had earned in an
election that was ruled valid by
the Election Committee._

«The SGEC stated that the USC
party would receive a censure for
its offenses in violation of the ex-
penditure clause. This was the
only sanction that SGEC told USC
party that would receive for that
violation. It therefore follows that
this first offense can not be taken
into account a second time with-
out obvious claims of double jeo-
pardy. ’

(II is for these reasons that the
SGEC had no right to refuse to
seat Steve Cundra as Student Gov-
ernment President.

(I submit at this point. on be-
half of Steve Cundra and Lee Cla-
bots. an urgent plea that the rul-
ing of the Election Committee be
reversed. This might formally be
called an official complaint. but
in a larger sense. it is no more
than an affirmation that the Stu-
dent Government President-elect
is Steve Cundra. In this "appeal"
we are asking that you express
your agreement with our legal
claims and confirm the seating of
Steve Cundra.

 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

State Senate; Students

Tackle Money Cris is 

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

A move to push Pitts alloca-
tions through the State Senate fail-

" ed Monday. In a telephone inter-

view with State Senator William
Sesler of Erie. senior Democratic
member of the Senate Education
Committee. prime sponsor of the
Pennsylvania Scholarship‘ and
Program and secretary of the
Democratic Caucaus, the Pitt
News got the following picture of
the latest legislative action.

A set of tax bills sent to the Sen-
ate, including college subsidies,
was cut back from 440 million
to $267 million by the Senate
Appropriations Committee.

Of this amount. a total expendi-
ture of $258 million is now avail-
able for allocations. Following a
decision to delay some allocations
which are not immediately cru-
cial. Senate Democrats moved to
amend Senate bill 1255 to increase
Pitts allocation from $26.9 mil-
lion to $35.8 million. This amend-
ment was presented in conjunc-
tion with a discharge resolution to
bring the bill out of committee.

On the floor, 19 Democratic
Senators supported the measure;
the remainder, Republicans, op-
posed it. Since 26 votes were re-
quired for passage, the measure
was defeated.

Within the next few days. Re-

publicans are expected to ask for

allocations in proportion to the
money now available. According
to Sen. Sesler. this means that
Pitt may get as little as 44 per
cent of the promised state aid.
This might stillnecessitate an in-
crease in Pitt's tuition for next
year. Sen. Sesler indicated his op-
position for this plan. saying.
"We've made a contract which we
have to honor. The money must be

.forthcoming. If the Republicans

maintain their present attitude in
the House and Senate there will be
no full funding.
IE-' >r< * >l<

Meanwhile. students at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. as well as
Penn State and Temple Universi-
ty. are becoming increasing con-
cerned with the financial crisis.
Student groups on this campus are
speculating on possible solutions
to the crisis. ‘

One possible course of action

has been suggested by Robert Fri-
day. a CAS sophomore. Friday is
circulating a "personalvpetition"
which is more than just a form
letter. The petition. available at
the Student Union desk and Tow-
ers main desk. “gives each person
filling it out a chance to express
what he feels is the most equitable
measure to raise money so we
can get our allocation."

A deadline of Tuesday. Feb. 17,
has been set to collect 20,000 peti-
tions at the Student Union desk.
Not just a statement of concern.

the petition offers the petitioner

the opportunity to support one of _
four suggested means of raising

additional State revenue: the util-

ity property tax, the unincorpor-
ated business tax. the unearned:
income tax and the personal in- I

come tax.

Recently, House Speaker K. Le-
roy Irvis told ‘this reporter that
public support for the personal in-
come tax would help him get such
legislation passed.

Erie Senator William Sesler.

commented Monday evening that

support of 20,000 students for ad- .

ditional, necessary taxation “will
be helpful” in settling the alloca-
tion difficulties.

CORRECTION
The names of Harris Miller-
and Shep Goldberg, SCU candi-
dates for president and vice-

president of Student Govern-F it

ment, were included on an IFC
flyer distributed before the
second SG election. Circulation
of printed matter was a viola-
tion of the election code. There-
fore, Miller and Goldberg were
included in the Election Com-
mittee’s censure of those can-
didates listed on the flyer. In a
release printed in Monday's
Pitt News, these names were
erroneously omitted. The Pitt
News did not willfully exclude
these names.

 Effects 0flPill Explained



  

by JUDY VOLLMER
Staff Writer

Dr. Rose Middleman of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the Plan-
ned Parenthood Association spoke
on "The Pill“ last Thursday af-
ternoon in the Student Union Sup-
per Room and stated. "In the
United States. only one woman in
3.800 has any possible risk of clot-
ting while using the pill. All possi-
ble adverse effects of the pill
were taken into consideration ear-
lier. This linkage with blood clot-
ting is not a sudden revelation that
has been hidden from the public."

Dr. Middleman stated that eight
and one-half million women in
America use the pill and that there
is only one-tenthof one per cent
chance that the pill will fail and
impregnation will occur.

in regard to common side ef-
fects of the pill. Dr. Middleman
explained that they are due to‘.a
change in the blood level. caused
by hormone imbalance. This ir-
regularity in hormone balance
may cause nausea. headache. and

other minor ailments. "These re-
actions mean simply that the body
needs another formula. to which it
can properly adjust." added Dr.
Middleman.

Some women, after using the
pill for a number of years, have
become infertile. But Dr. Middle-
man added that, “The majority of

women resume normal reproduc-
tive functions after three, or
sometimes six months after stop-
ping pill usage.”

Dr. Middleman made a final
point that if use of the pill were
discontinued. there would be an ap-
proximate 10 per cent increase in
unwanted pregnancies.

Birth Control!!!

Editor. The Pitt News:

As we all know. making love and
the nude human body are both ex-
tremely filthy. For this reason
the movie I Am Curious (Yellow)
was not shown here for winter
weekend. Had it been shown our
protector against sin. the District
Attorney. would have raided it.
The students of Pitt along with the
Pittsburgh community should
thank him for saving our morals.
We should show our appreciation
by rallying out support to him and
by offering ideas on laws to pro-
hibit anytkind of dirtyness.

Unfortunately. it would be dif-
ficult to enforce a law against sex
or being nude. but the District At-
torney should make a stand

_ against those who flaunt the fact

that they were nude and had sex.
I am referring to the pregnant
woman.

How dare a pregnant woman
walk the streets where innocent
children could see her. Everyone
knows what she did—she had sex
(in the nude. no doubt)! One night
she and her husband while under
the influence of the devil (cursed

I be he) removed their clothes to

enjoy the sinful, physical pleas-
ure of intercourse. The result is
her pregnancy.

But. may 1- add. many author-
ities have told me that one does
not get pregnant each time ,that
she has intercourse. Therefore.
how many other times has the
pregnant woman had sex? But one
thing is almost a proven fact: one
hundred percent of all pregnant
women have had sex at one time
or another.

If I am startling and shocking
you with these ugly figures. please
forgive me. but it is time this dis-
gusting problem is brought to the
fore and dealt with.

I propose that the District At-
torney lobby for a law prohibiting
any pregnant woman from living
in. coming_ into. or traveling

It is time the District Attorney

What's a career with a social conscience?

Quite simply, one that offers responsibility and chal-
lenge on the one hand. And social involvement and
commitment on the other.

One that can be financially satisfying without sacrific-
ing emotional values.

One where progress is based on performance and
merit.

In short, the kind of rewarding career that a company
like Prudential offers you.

Our basic business, of course, is to protect the basic
unit of society-—the family. But we've extended our
social involvement to helping fight urban decay and
unemployment.

By investing in new businesses and new factories.

The Prudential Insurance

A career with a social conscience:

an explanation and an invitation to career-seeking graduates.

 

 

By providing funds for low—cost” housing. And, in
addition, our people provide the leadership required

V to build hospitals, colleges, and libraries.

 

I if an equal opportunity employer

In short, Prudential is concerned with not just life
itself, but with the quality of life. This is the kind
of company we are. And not by chance, but by choice.

If you're a socially-conscious graduate, we'd like to
have you join us. In marketing, management, invest-
ments, applied computer technology, accounting, sales,
or actuarial areas.

Drop into your college Placement Office. Find out
when the Prudential representative is scheduled to
visit your campus. Then make an appointment to talk
to him about a career that offers both tangible and
intangible rewards.

Underground Theatre

Wednesday, February 11, l970——THE PITT NE WS-—Page 7

What Price ---------- Experimentation??? r

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
. Contributing Critic

There were large crowds at
last week-end's presentation by
the Underground Theatre. and jus-
tifiably so. Every one of the 160 or
more seats were filled. with a
number of people standing around
the perimeter. No doubt. the audi-
ence as well as the staff of the the-
ater itself were pleased at the
turn—out and the success of the
evening.

With the exception of the The
Typist, reviewed earlier in the

' week. the other two presentations

of Cinder Box and The Problem
deserve some special mention. As
enjoyable as the evening was.
there were flaws. not enough to
keep anyone away (for the total ef-
fect was most pleasing». but

' which deserve some comment.

* >I< *

There is certainly a great deal
to be said for experimentation in
theatre. In such a multi-faceted

medium with great. possibilities

for the evolvement of new forms.
it is almost mandatory. especial-
ly in an institutional setting. to
allow creative people to be just
that! However. at what price do
we experiment. and where do we
draw the line?

It is hardly believable that the
“people in charge” could have ser-
iously felt that Cinder Box. the
first of three one act plays, had
any potential other than being an
example of poor theatre, if that
description is adequate. In fact,
those connected with the theatre
who I talked to were curiously si-
lent about it and I for one don’t
blame them.

I have the feeling that the au-
thoress (Miss L. M. Sullivan: is
an intelligent person. and there
certainly was indication of some
talent. intention. and feeling in her
work. Yet this example of her
ability is so misguided that her
own objectivity must have left her
long before its completion.

There was no continuity. no rec-

ognizable plot. little structure.
and above all no significant de-

seen that was justifiable. The ac-
tors strained at the bit. the music
and lyrics were “Mickey Mouse"
and the total effect was as dra-
matically unsatisfying as the fall

‘she took stage center, a few min-

utes prior to curtain. If Ted Mack
had appeared to introduce Cinder
Box I would have been amazed at
his choice.

Every playwright has his bad
days, but whose feed-back led her
on . . . and where was this persons
feeling for the audience that had
to sit through it? How the theatre
could have condescended to allow
such a pretense to be performed
is beyond the rationalization of
this critic. Why it wasplaced in
the beginning is also puzzling.

Did they really want a captive
audience? Could they not have lost
much of their audience. for the
other two far more enjoyable
plays. if the seating had not been
so confining? By the time the third
presentation came around. the au-

dience certainly deserved to be a

   

lot fresher and less fatigued. The
content and length of the first
certainly did nothing for the ex-
pectations and a lot to decrease
our ability to be wide-awake and

-alert. Perhaps there is room for

thought when we think of such
things as. order. length. and dra-
matic value (content. and pur-
pose» when planning for future
productions?

commented on in last Wednes-

latter is a wildly funny farce
around "social injustice“ utiliz-

imagination and a great deal of
humor. It deserves three rounds
of applause.

Undergraduate Orientation:

Previews University Experience I

by CARL E. VAN HORN
Contributing Writer, Chairman,
Undergraduate Orientation

This year an attempt is being
made by the Undergraduate Ori-
entation Committee to develop a
program for incoming freshmen
which will present a brief glimpse
of the University experience. The
committee hopes to paint an im-

pressionistic picture of the Uni-

versity and the more subtle. per-
sonal and intellectual challenges
it provides. The program also will
emphasize the need for individual
responsibility which is tanta-
mount to survival in the multiver-
sity and in our society.

To carry this philosophy. the
committee has developed a pro-
gram with wide variety which al-
lows the new student to make

 

EVERY DIAMOND IS DIFFERENT‘
AND WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

Differences in quality make one stone worth
more than another. Delicate gradations of color,
almost invisible imperfections sometimes
present. accuracy of cut are of utmost importance
in the value of a diamond. You can depend
on us to explain these differences to you when you
choose your diamond.

choices. Thus. while the Orienta-
tion session is made mandatory
by the University. attending pro-
grams within the sessions will be
optional. It is the committees
hope to offer those events which
will be most interesting to new
students and that they will attend
them of their own volition. The
emphasis will be on faculty in-
volvement and group dnynamics.
rather than on the mechanical as-
pects of attending Pitt.

This summer. each of the
schools taking part in the orienta-
tion program--Engineering. Nurs-
ing. and CAS—will play a larger
part than before. Each will be al-
loted a substantial portion of the
two and one half day session to
familiarize its students with the
respective
school and or profession. The re-
mainder of the session will con-
sist of programs which may ap-
peal to all students, regardless of
school. There will be such pro-
grams as: the Military Obligation
—with ROTC, the Selective Serv-
ice. and a professional draft coun-
selor present; the Women's Lib-
eration, University Governance
and Student Government; Innova-
tions in Education—the Arts and
Sciences Review Committee pro-
posal; the Commuter Problem;
the Students Role in Social Self-
Governance. In addition. there,
will be- several social activities
held in the evenings, including W.
C. Fields movies, folk singers. a
play, and multi-media dance.

Perhaps the most important
part of the program will be the
hosts and hostesses, each of
whom will work with l5_,students
during each of the three sessions.
These students will be selected
primarily on their ability and de-
sire to interact with new students
as well as an evidence of their
University and community in-
volvement. They will comprise the
spine of the program because
face-to-face contact is the best
form of communication. They may
function as guides, information
centers, buddies, counselors, ad-
visors, or discussion leaders, but
most importantly, they will not do
things for the freshmen, but will
help the freshmen to do things for
themselves.

Applications for hosts and host-
esses will be available beginning
Feb. 11 at the SU Desk. They
should ‘be returned by Feb. 20 to
the Dean of Students‘ office. 1209
CL. Approximately 80 people are
needed. For further information
about the program or the group
leaders. call ext. 7250.

The full-time committee mem-
bers are Ray Kenney and Linda
Skomsky. hosts and hostesses;
Richard Box, academic affairs;
"Ronnie Matis, social affairs;
Sharon Nelson, special program
coordinator; Janice Rosenfeld,
committee secretary; and Diana
Ulyon, communications advisor.
Mrs. Jean Regester, assistant to
the dean of students. is serving as
program coordinator for Student
Affairs.

Harry Litwack will bring
his Temple basketball squad
to Pittsburgh tonight for a
game against the Panthers at the
Civic Arena. the first game the
Jungle Cats will play in the Igloo
as host. The game gets underway
at the normal 8:15 starting time.

Litwack has been head coach of
the Owls for 18 _years and had a
.667 winning pace alive going into
this season. That mark was topped
off with a surprising National In-

gm 51-RUNK vitational Tournament champion-

Crisis
By Martha Hitrtle

Sports Editor

 

L The current financial situation facing the University is of
vital concern to the entire University community and the Ath-
letic Department is no exception. ’

One area which could be immediately affected is the re-
cruiting program and according to Athletic Director Casi-

‘ mir, the current publicity regarding the financial situation

has been very bad and does affect. our recruiting. “Someone
from Ohio State just has to come along and ask a prospect
why do you want to go to a school that’s going to close down?”
commented Myslinski. “Of course Penn State" is having the
same problem,” he added.

Another project whichlhas been temporarily tabled due
to finances is the artificial turfing of the Stadium.’

Despite the financial situation that may be harming the
recruiting, however, grid coach Carl DePasqua continues to
sign up blue chip prospects for next year’s freshman team.
The latest two recruits to sign letters of intent are tackle Art
Simon and fullback Paul Felinczak.

Simon is a 6’3” 220 pound tackle from Churchill and
he’s the third Big 33 player to accept a Pitt offer. He was an
all-conference and all-WPIAL selection and also was named
to the second team all-state squad.

In addition, the big lineman was a three-year letterman
and captain of his high school team. He had scholarship offers
from more than 100 schools.

v Felinczak, a 6’, 210 pound fullback from Hopewell High,
was a three-year letterman, captain and most valuable play-
er on the Hopewell team and was a first-team all-conference
pick. He runs the 100-yard dash in 10.4 seconds. '

Simon and Felinczak join Kiski’s Clair Wilson and Sto
Rox’s Bob Medwid as the first four prospects in the fold for
next fall.

Latest word on the 11th football game is that the Athletic
Department is definitely considering and they’re still looking.
Myslinski has received feelers from a number of interested
schools but there’s still nothing definite to report.

If an extra game is added to the home schedule, look for
the Panthers to play one of the six home contests in the Three
Rivers Stadium. It’s a possibility.

Speaking of scheduling, Pitt has contacted Duquesne re-
garding basketball. Myslinski cites the importance of the
good inter-city rivalry which the game would create. The
game would be a natural for the city. And speaking of natur-
als, how about Pitt, Penn State, Duquesne and West Virginia
for future Steel Bowl match-ups?

From this spectator’s viewpoint, Georgia Tech appears
to be the best team on the eager schedule thus far and 6’10”
center Rich Yunkus lived up to his advance billing as he
scored 31 points while playing only sparingly in the second

-..halfL. But look for theLLPanth_e,rLs to bounce*back,to'ni_ght-as they . .

prominence among Philadelphias

Last week the Owls gave the na-
tion’s number two team, South
Carolina, one of their biggest
scares of the season.

cocks by five points at halftime in
their friendly Palestra. but fell be-

Temple's forte is an effective
zone defense which keeps the
scores down and that could mean

.a low—scoring encounter from two

good’ defenses because the Pan-
thers‘ defense , has been confus-
ing many opponents this year. a

Before the Panthers’ last two
defeats teams were finding it dif-
ficult to climb above 70 points in a
game.

The»Owls have another similar- .

ity with the Jungle Cat squad —

NIT champs. The Cats. of course.

team that went 4-20 last year. but

Drew Nolan. one of two seniors
forthe Owls. is the man Litwack
depends upon for the big baskets.
Bill Strunk». a 6'3“ guard and the
Owls‘ 6'7" center. Lee Trees. are
the other standouts.

The Panthers are attempting to
reach the .500 mark also this win-
ter. About three times they have
fallen one game short of the feat
and they are currently 7-10, with

six games remaining on their

schedule.

 

BUS TO ARENA

A final reminder that the two
Campus buses will shuttle stu-
dents to and from the Civic
Arena tonight for the Panther-
Temple contest.

The buses will begin running
at 6 p.m. with stops at the Tow-
ers and the Fifth Ave. side of
the Student Union. Following '
the game, the buses will trans-
port students back to campus.

When Tim Grgurich‘s freshmen quintet oppose
the Youngstown JVs in tonight's 6:15 preliminary
at the Arena. they can't expect the identical soft. un-
ruffled victory ride that they obtained in whipping
the Johnstown Campus Monday night. 75-48.

Despite some inaccurate shooting and poor ball-
handling at the close of the first half. the Cubs roll-
ed-up a 38-20 lead. Guard Marvin Abrams sparked
the Cubs during the initial 20 minutes by popping-in

16 tallies.

After six minutes of the second half had passed.
the Johnstowners squeezed the Cub lead to nine
points. 43-34. At this point. Grgurichs vocal chords
were working much harder and faster than was the
team offense. He continually screamed. "Start

moving. get inside!"

The Cubs had a rugged time trying to move
through Johnstown’s zone defense. And when it ap-
peared that the Cubs might crack the zone, the ball

As Ridl Looks For 8th Victory

One of the reasons for the im-
proved Jungle Cat record is a re-
spectable shooting game. Last
season the Cats shot about 35 per
cent. Their shooting is above 40
per cent accuracy this winter.

Kent Scott is the key to the im-
proved marksmanship. He leads
the team with a 16.5 average and
is shooting at a 52 per cent clip.
Paul O'Gorek and Mike Paul are
also averaging 11 points per game
but Paul‘s shooting accuracy is
the lowest of the Cat starters.

Georgia Tech pressed the Panther offense from the tos”

up Monday night, just as Pitt coach Buzz Ridl expected. His c 
ers couldn’t handle the aggresive defense as well as he thou ti‘
they would, though, and the Southerners stomped the Cats, 92-6 _

The Panthers stayed with Georgia Tech for the first fl
minutes, but Rich Yankus, the 6’91/2”, All-America candid er
sunk a free throw to break an 8-8 deadlock with 13:02 rema

ing in the first half. and the Wreck
defense forced the Cats into many
turnovers.

“We expected them to press, but
we expected to go right through
the press,” Ridl said. “I didn’t
think we’d have that much of a
problem.” A

"Six or seven or eight times."

Assistant Fran Webster mutter-V

the Cats overshot the mark on at-

Yunkus. the tallest of the big

but his 11 rebounds-—along with
the 39-25 advantage the Yellow
Jackets had in total rebounding-
probably hurt the Panthers more.
The Cats missed a lot of shots and
weren't able to must any board

Ridl removed the Panther big-

Morris collected 14 points this entire second half to-

“We were still thinking a bit about the past Du-

squad’s occasional sluggishness. ’ 0

Nevertheless. Randy Arnold's strong job on the

boards and reserve guard Andy Phillips‘ overall hus- --

Over Tunes, 62-51

by JERRY MYERS
Losing both the first and last

races proved costly for the Pitt .
Tankers as they dropped their

fourth meet of the season. 62-51.
to Grove City at the Grove City

pool yesterday. V
The first event. a 400 yard
medley relay race. gave the

Grovers a 7-0 jump on the Pan-
thers and they never relinquished
their lead for the rest of the meet.
Coach Grant commented. "We
were recovering all the way from
the first event."

The meet went down to the wire
though with the last event. the
400 yard dreestyle relay being the
deciding race. The Grovers. lead
lby their ace anchorman Skib Ar-
buckle. copped the event with a
time of 3223.2 to seal the Pan-
thers‘ fate.

Arbuckle hurt‘ the Panthers
twice before during the course of
the afternoon, swimming in both
the 400 medley relay and 100 yard
freestyle events. He anchored the
victorious relay race and won the
freestyle race handily with a tim
of 50.6. .

Trying to narrow the margin all
afternoon. the mermen streaked

. to six first places in the 13 events. ‘

Tom Hays sprinted to a victory in

a fine effort in the final relay race.
Unfortunately it wasn‘t enough to
win the meet. ’

Little Dave Anderson chipped in
with a photo-finish victory in the

2:l4.9, only a fraction of a second

AI Morris stayed tough to win the -

Returning to action after being‘

out for over three weeks was Cliff
Rowe who made a comeback for
a third place finish in the 200 yard
breaststroke.

The Panthers went into the con-‘

test pretty evenly matched with
the Grovers. The home pool ad-
vantage was a decisive factor in
the meet along with the fact that
there was only one judge. Small
technicalities played their part
but Coach Grant summed it up
like this. “We gave it away in the

first event. We just had too much '

to come back from.
