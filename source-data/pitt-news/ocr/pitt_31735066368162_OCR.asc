Board Candidates Discuss Platforms

By BRIAN BALK

The two presidential candidates
for Student Government Board,
Spencer Davis and Mark Downs,
debated the issue of experience at a
“Meet the Candidates” forum in

 the Towers Lobby on Monday.

“Experience of sitting on the
board is not that essential,” Downs
said. Downs, who has no previous
experience with SGB, said Davis
only knows the university bylaws,
the SGB constitution and the allo-
cations procedures.

Davis countered by emphasizing
the need for board experience as
being crucial for the presidency.

“I personally feel that you don’t
learn the job in a campaign,”
Davis, a one-year board member,

said. “You have to see it from the
inside.”

Davis said there is more to being
president than just having an

understanding of the bylaws and,

the constitution.

“It is important to learn from
mistakes. That’s where experience
plays a part in this election,” he
said.

Following the presidential can-
didates’ speeches, the board candi-
dates were then given the
opportunity to speak their views.
The majority of the speeches were
redundant, stressing the impor-
tarice of communication and prior
experience.

PLO DefeatCould
Lead toCivi| War

By RAY WUSLICH

Israel accomplished nothing by
invading Lebanon, and the defeat
of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization could set the stage for
a renewed civil war, according to
Dr. Christopher Giannou, medical
director of the Nabatie Hospital in
Lebanon at the time of the inva-
sion. Giannou spoke at the Inter-
national Affairs Forum at Pitt last
week.

“Nothing has been accom-
plished by the
Lebanon. Resistance to t e Israeli
annexation of the West Bank and
Gaza has not been reduced and the
state of armed conflict in Lebanon

has not been solved," he said.

Giannou argued that the mil-
itary defeat of the PLO in Lebanon
could set the stage for a renewed
civil war. He said that a stalemate
had developed between the various
factions and that the elimination of

inwtiion of"

the PLO as a factor created a power
vacuum.

“In 1981, a ceasefire was
arranged and Galilee and the state
of Lebanon knew a peace they had
not known in years," Giannou
said. “In 1982, we were given an
Orwellian analogy that war is
peace for Galilee.”

When the Israelis invaded, many
people fled to the hospitals because
they thought they would be
immune to attack.

“The Red Crescent (PLO ver-
sion of the Red Cross) hospital in
Sidon at one time had up to 4,000
people seeking refuge. The hospi-
tal was hit at least five or six times,”
Giannou said.

“The Israelis dropped leaflets‘

telling people to leave, but it was
never clear where the people were
supposed to go,” Giannou said.
There were 10 private hospitals

and continuity” is needed in stu-
dent government.

0 The main point candidate
Arpi Asdourian made was that
SGB must provide more ample
representation for students. “It is
important that all students know
and have access to the Student
Government Board,” she said.

0 Kathy Brown’s policy revolved
around improving the quality of
life at Pitt. She said commuters,
academic life and residence life are
the most important places where
the board can improve itself on.

_O Jeff Delmontagne, who is run-
ning for his second term on the
board, said that he is thoroughly
disgusted with the liaison process

and will attempt to realign it if
elected.

0 Commuters were the concerns
of candidate Kevin Fischer’s
speech. “Commuters are basically
shunned away from the adminis-
tration,” he said. One of Fischer’s
proposals is to provide a parking
lot solely for commuters.

0 Mindy Goldberg dwelled on
the issue of a workable communca-
tions network. She said communi-

_.cation is a two-way process and

students must stand up to the
administration if something needs
changed.

0 Barry Greene’s aspiration is to
set up a “mandatory teacher eval-
uation system,” if he is elected.

Pitt is planning to increase its
use of personal computers
among students and faculty
members, Pitt chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar told the Senate
Council Monday.

Senate Council members
agreed to the purchasing and
placing of personal computers
at selected centers where engi-
neering and natural science stu-
dents can have access to them
up to 24 hours a day.

Posvar also discussed the pos-
sibility of using personal com-
puters for teaching purposes.
Instructional computer pro-
gramming can be used for sub-
jects such as engineering and
business, he said, and “espe-
cially in areas of high demand
such as teaching about compu-
ters themselves.”

He added that “while were
pleased with CMU’s, we're not
envious.” Carnegie-Mellon
recently announced that all of
its students will be equipped
with computers.

discount does not extend to
faculty members. Several coun-
cil members asked that the dis-
count be extended to faculty
because many departments
could use computers for data
keeping. The council didn’t act
on the request.

In other business, Wilfred
Daehnick, chairman of the
Senate Budget Policies Com-
mittee, presented statis_tics com-
paring the salaries of Pitt
professors with faculty salaries
at 20 other schools. The average
salary of a Pitt professor was a
little over $39,000 a year for
1981-82, placing Pitt salaries in
the middle of the 20 schools.

He noted in the report that
the universities used for com-
parison were selected in 1978 by
the Compensation Committee
of the Budget Policies Commit-
tee and Senior Vice Chancellor
for Administration Jack
Freeman.

“It is a convenient coinci-
dence that Pitt’s salaries in 1978
were almost precisely at the
median of this group," accord-
ing to Daehnick’s report.

DeLuca Reflects onHisYear

His day begins at 7:30 a.m. In
the office within an hour, he
begins to answer messages,
make phone calls and write
letters. Occasionally, after deal-
ing with problems ranging
from parking complaints to
errant board members, there's
time for a class or two.

That’s a typical day for Todd
DeLuca, who is now finishing
his term as Pitt's Student
Government Board president.
As elections for a new board and
president begin, DeLuca
reflected on his year as president
and the changes—both personal
and professional—-—that it
caused.

“The presidency is an
experience second to none,” De—
Luca said, “but the opportunity
and the experience cost
something.” For DeLuca, the
demands of his job meant
missing classes and not having
the time to get involved in other
organizations.

It also meant becoming a
recognized figure on campus,
which has its disadvantages.

“There were very few times
when I could go out and enjoy
myself without someone
bringing up something about
the SGB,” DeLuca, who is also
a Delta Tau Delta fraternity
member, said. “When you're
bothered by problems with the
board, it’s hard to get them off
your mind and leave them
behind you.”

DeLuca said that when he
became president, “people did
expect that the president of the
SGB should act a certain way.
But I'm also a student, and I've
never expressed anything
differently.” DeLuca said he
noticed that some students
treated him differently than
other board members and were
more hesitant about talking
with him.

Despite these changes, De—
Luca doesn’t regret serving on
the board for a year and

only get from holding a major
leadership role on campus.”

DeLuca includes among his
accomplishments as president
the changes in the funding
process for student groups that
allow for more social
programming, the inclusion of
students on the curriculum
reform implementation
committees, the Student
Government Task Force on
Financial Aid Cuts and the SGB
lobbying efforts in Washington
and Harrisburg.

“I would have liked to have
gone further with t’he teacher

 thought the president
would be able -to ask that
things be done, and they
would be done. I found out
you have to watch over peo-
ple ﬁnd make sure that
they’re getting them done.”

evaluations than we did,” De-
Luca said. He believes,
however, that the board did
begin to make progress on the
issue and that “it‘s not a one-
year problem. Within the next
couple of years, students may
have mandatory teaching
evaluations.” .

The worse aspect of his job,
DeLuca believes, was dealing
with students “who really never
did anything but criticized
whatever the board did.” He
added that Student Union
renovations, which caused the
board to be temporarily housed
in the Schenley Hall basement,
disrupted the actions of board
members and its committee and
governance group members.

A Student Government
Board president must also work
with administrators on various
projects. The SGB this year
developed a survey and spent a
lot of time combating an

being voted on.

DeLuca attributed the health
fee incident to “bad timing and
a lack of communication"
between the board and the

administration. DeLuca said
that he has worked on
improving that communica-

tion and that the board has
“been generally well received"
by administrators.

Because Student Government
Board members come from a
wide variety of student interests

(i.e., fraternities and profehf?

sional groups)‘, the SGB
president also has to find ways
to make nine students with
different outlooks work with
each other.

“From the outset, I tried to
give everyone the feeling that
he's representing the entire
student body,” DeLuca said.
“Certainly, within the year,
there were a couple minor per-
sonality conflicts, but I think
they were solved by the respect
each member had for each
other.”

DeLuca has been involved in
student government since his
freshman year, during which he
joined the Legal Awareness
Committee and served as an
officer for the. group. The
following year, he ran
successfully for the board, and
last year, for the presidency.

From watching his predeces-
sor, DeLuca said he had a pretty
clear picture of what the job
entailed.

“When I was running for the
presidency, I thought the
president would be able to ask
that things be done, an(l they
would be done. I’ve found out
you have to watch over people
and make sure that they’re

doors and wouldn't treat anyone
who couldn't pay for it, Giannou
said.

“There were two cases Wl1€I\,

private hospitals because they

Giannou said.

Giannou was eventually taken
prisoner by the Israelis. Lines of

and the other wore a hood with slits
cut out for his eyes.

“You eventually learn to cope
with the arbitrariness of war. Not
knowing if the next shell is going
to land on you or not. But it is
terrifying when you have to stand
there and be accused by some
hooded bastard, and there isn’t a
thing you can do about it,” Gian-
nou said.

Giannou described how some
prisoners were beaten at random or

0 One candidate, Connie
Kreischer, deviated from the issues
of communications and experience
and centered upon the misconcep-
tions of student government. She
said SGB offers a number of chan-
nels that the students do not utilize

, to their full advantage.

6‘

 The central point of Dan Lec-

ce’s speech was that student
government‘ must be more visible

. to the students. “SGB works with a
budget of one—fourth of a million.
It is important that the students
know where their money is going,”
Lecce said.

0 One of the proposals of Jeff
Mallinger’s speech was to prevent
the Allocations Committee from
cutting funds. He also stressed the
need for a 24-hour health service.

0 “Anyone can join a committee,
but not everyone can work on one,”
said candidate Lorenzo McQueen.
Being a freshman, he emphasized

that past qualifications are not

 portant as others think.

0 Craig Murphy explained that
student government is hard work
and that every day new responsibil-
ities are handed out.

0 Candidate Jan Frank said that
her experience in various other
activities will aid her in being an
effective board member. “I can
understand the needs of the student
because of my involvement," she
said.

O Candidate Chuck Pascal criti-
cized the incumbent board for not
taking action on certain issues.
One example that he cited was the
boards obliviousness to the Port
Authority Transit rate hike.

0 Wendy Pekich also stressed the
need of communication between
governance groups and SGB.

O A temporary student union
was suggested by candidate Loretta

wiﬂetretti as a solution to the com-

umuter apathy problem.

0 Candidate Jeff Schaffer
stressed that there must be a reason
why tuition has gone up $400 from
last year. He said if elected he
would try to answer this question,
and present a solution to the rising

cost of education.
0 Ken Stram also stressed con-

cern for the commuters. “The com-
muters represent 65 percent of our
students at Pitt. They need to get
involved,” Strain said.

a O The last speaker was Progres-

*:*‘~4§iv'e Student Network president

Tom Wanko. The major point of
his speech was that students must
learn to take control and not let the
administration rule their lives. “It
is time that the students stand up
and oppose tuition hikes that
could discontinue their educa-
.tion..."~W'a.nlso saitl ....... » . ...... . ..  .-

were ordered, or condoned, but at
the very least they were tolerated."

Conditions in Lebanon were
deplorable even before the Israeli
invasion, Giannou said. He said
that the massacre had begun even
before the Israeli invasion.

“Southern Lebanon is a ne-
glected area. Diseases are rampant
and that is without a war. War has
provided a recipe for disaster.
There are tens of thousands of peo-
ple in the Bekaa Valley who don't
have permanent shelters. It snows
in the Bekaa Valley," Giannou
said.

Giannou said he was not inter-
ested in laying blame for what is
happening in the Middle East.

“If you are interested in laying
blame, you can go to the British in
1916 with the Balfour declaration
and the Sikes-Picot agreement. In
the Middle East nobody’s hands are
clean,” he said.

He said that Israel exists whether
the Palestinians like it or not and
that the Palestinians exist whether
the Israelis like it or not. “Rights
must be equal and universal, other-
wise by definition they are not
rights but a privilege," Giannou
said. I

Giannou also suggested that if
Israel had to pay the full cost of the
invasion then ’Menachem Begin
and Ariel Sharon would not be so
popular. He said that the U.S. sub-
sidizes Israel and this allowed large
numbers of Israeli tourists to travel
to Europe last summer, which
meant that the domestic popula-
tion did not have to be placated.

Giannou charged that Israel is
“no longer a state with an army,
but an army with a state," and he
suggested that the invasion could
not have taken place without U.S.
knowledge. “The Israeli invasion
proceeded with the knowledge of
Mr. Haig and if he did not give
them the green light, then they
were certainly given a yellow one."

Giannou also charged that the
U.S. did not have a policy in the
Middle East. “Mr. Haig is a spe-
cialist on European affairs—you
do not impose European solutions
on the Middle East.” A

The Modern Michelangelo of Pittsburgh

The Use of Lasers as Art  

~ By TIM PALUCKA

“Welcome to Laserium,"
says laser artist John Hanson,
the whispered words rolling
effortlessly off his tongue,
becoming warm, sonorous
tones through the sound sys-
tem. A diffuse light from the
control board reveals a tall,
thin, fashionably dressed
young man at the microphone,
his gold wire-rimmed glasses
fixed firmly beneath a neat
split-down-the-middle crop of
sandy brown hair.

He smiles at the audience's
response to his D] patter rattled
off with the confidence born of
a thousand repetitions; he
laughs, sets the microphone
down and assumes his position
behind his optical syn-
thesizer—a modern Michelan-
gelo ready to decorate the Buhl
Planetarium dome as trium-
phantly as the Sistine Chapel
had been adorned in earlier
days.

Save the muted white stars
that slide across the concave

surface of the dome, the plane-
tarium is dark; the previously
boisterous audience falls silent
in anticipation. Suddenly, a
soft strain of music wells up
from nowhere and everywhere,
and all eyes turn upward as Led
Zeppelin introduces “The Song
Remains the Same.”

In an explosion rivaling the
Big Bang, the planetarium
becomes a pulsating nerve of
light, color and sound-
concentric polygons of nature’s
purest reds, greens, yellows and
blues undulate to the beat,
advancing like an enormous
mouth about to swallow the
crowd, then retreating instan-
taneously to a pinpoint on the
verge of extinction.

For a solid hour, the light
rarely fades, the music rarely
stops, and the audience never
settles down. This is Laserium.

“It’s a trip and a half—that‘s
the best way to describe it,”
Hanson says of the laser extrav-
aganza that has been his pas-
sion for the last four years.
“Once you start getting into it,
there is almost a psychic inter-
action going on. Itjust takes off
and goes.”

Hanson has been taking off
with Laserium since he was 20
years’ old, when, sporting a
background he describes as

“music, electronics and crazi-
ness,” he was hired by Laser
Images, Inc. in 1977. The musi-
cal experience came from play-
ing high-energy bass in tavern
bands, the electronics was
mostly seat-of-the-pants
designing of sound systems,
and the crazin-ess—well, that
was all his own.

“When people call me crazy I
say ‘thanks,’ ” Hanson says.
“As long as it’s at least slightly

creative and we’re all having a
good time, and that’s a lot of
what Laserium is all about.”
Training consisted of a few
months of informal instruction
at the side of an experienced la-
serist, during which time Han-
son learned the subtleties of the

including everything from
maintenance to the philosophy
N

takes his talent to Seattle, Salt
Lake City, Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, refining his style,
enthralling audiences and
expanding his philosophy to
include his own experiences
with the laser. He shares his
thoughts enthusiastically.

In a word, Hanson describes
his style as “fusionist,” borrow-
ing from the musical ideas of
Jean Luc Ponty, Herbie Han-

cock and Lee Rittenauer, which
have their roots in a jazz
accented with modern tight,
clean licks with just a touch of
synthesizers. Though he never
tires of Laserium’s sound-
track—he listens to it in his
apartment—it’s the ‘fusion
music which gives him creative
inspiration.

“In fusion music, there’s a lot
of room to play around, be

fluid, but you don’t always take

it; you keep it real tight.” Han-
son explains. “In Laserium,
there’s an incredible amount of
room to do all sorts of crazy
things, but you don’t always do
them. An oriental paradox of
tight and fluid at the same
time—that’s the best way to de-
scribe how I like to do the
shows.” I

the well defined, animated
dancing interpretations that
Hanson prefers and relies more
on “primal, pulsating stuff,”
there is ample room for his tal-
ent to shine.

With simple, rhythmic twists
of his fingers he manipulates
the one-hundred-plus dials,
buttons and switches of the
optical synthesizer with master-
ful precision, choosing colors
and patterns from his electronic
palette and splashing them on
his concave canvas with a deft
touch. .

From the Crayola catas-
trophe interpretation of
“Johnny. B. Goode” by Maho-
gany Rush to the technicolor
tapesty of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s
“Freebird,” the quality never
fades. Hanson wouldn’t allow
it. “The idea is’ to take people as

close to the edge as possible,”
he says, “then back off before
you start doing something
again, to keep everybody into
it.”

But there is something much‘
more subtle happening here,
also. The mood of the laserist,
the expectations of the
audience, the flow of spiritual
energy-all these are relevant to
the success of a performance;
each show takes on its own fla-
vor according to these
variables.

When everything flows,
Hanson is lost in the energy
and becomes merely a medium
for the experience. “When
there’s a very good interchang,
of energy going on between me’
and the audience,” Hanson
explains, “it’s not so much
‘Hey, look what I‘m doing,’ but
‘Wow, what a great thing to be
in tune with.’ It just takes off
and goes.”

Laser art does not exist with-
out the music, Hanson believes;
its substance lies in the combi-
nations of the sensual stimuli
involved. The laserist is thus
creating the most ephemeral art
of all; it can’t be sold at auction,
hung in a museum or stored in
an attic. And that is part of its
charm.

“One of the reasons for Lase-

‘\

‘Q:

rium’s existence is that it can"*‘I

be captured,” Hanson says, the
blank dome testifying to his
words. “It’s there in your mind
forever; it just doesn’t have
anybody’s signature at the
bottom."

The theme for Black Week at the University of Pittsburgh, “ldentity...A Means of Self-
Expression” was derived to exemplify our history as it relates to the struggles Black college
students experience preparing for leadership roles in the Black community. According to the
Black Action Society philosophy, “Our objective is to provide quality educational, political, social
and cultural programs for our constituency.” It is the belief of the 1982-83 BAS Steering Commit-
tee that this year’s programs are in alignment with that philosophy.

Opinion

The Pitt News  
Endorsements

The 1982 elections, have been hyped by the press and
politicians as being one of the most important off-year
elections in a long time. It's a strong test of Reaganomics
and the Republican majority in Washington.

The 1982 Student Government Board race is quite the
opposite. There are no clear—cut issues in the race, or so
we’ve been told, so most of the candidates are running on
their past experiences with the board and other groups.
Lack of communication-that ambiguous phrase—kept
popping up as the main “issue” in this year’s elections.

Of course, there are many issues to be dealt with by the
SGB. The fact that there are 23 board candidates is proof
enough that students want to get involved and help Pitt.
undergraduates with their problems. Unfortunately, these
23 unique individuals could not find the hidden issues and

‘ had no answers for the obvious ones.

In light of this, the only choice we had was to base our
endorsements on past experiences of the candidates. Look-
ing over the field of this year’s group, some stood out as
having had the experience of successfully working with
the administration, the allocations process and students.

One candidate, who has spent a year on the board
already and is running a second time, showed us that he
does not deserve to be re-elected. Jeff Delmontagne, besides
the fact that he was on the board, hadnothing to show for
the year he put in. He did not list any accomplishments,
and we feel he should not be allowed to continue this
non-productivity for another year.

Because experience was the main issue and the main
source of debate between the two presidential candidates,
WE ‘Eilti8is‘é SBSHEEP Haws tar president. Davis has spent a
year on the board and understands the administrative
duties that are expected of him. Although he did not make
any great changes while he was a board member, we feel
his experience will play an important role in the student
government presidency.

Davis hasvseveral ideas that he would like to implement
for the benefit of Pitt students if he is elected. He wants to
get more student input in the alcohol task force and would
like to increase lobbying for increased student aid. We
hope with more power in his hands he will follow through
on these goals.

Among the board candidates, Kathy Brown, while hav-
ing no experience on SGB, has worked with other student
groups. She also was one of the few candidates who had
specific ideas on issues. She said she wants to implement a
computerized roommate selection for the residents. She
also wants to set up faculty-student forums to exchange
ideas on various topics.

Candidate Connie Kreischer has been the chairman of
the Governmental Relations Committee, so she is familiar
with both the SGB procedures and the state procedures
concerning student aid. She has also worked on various
governmental cotmnittees in the community. She said she
wants to increase SGB's involvement in the student aid
crunch, something we feel is essential.

We hope that the large field of candidates this year will
inspire a larger student turnout at the polls. T

Finally, we hope that the candidates who eventually
take office will work to fulfill the promises they made in
» the campaign. ‘

ThisBud’sForYou

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

It seems that everyone these days

t is concerned about excessive drink-

ing on college campuses. Many
universities; Pitt included, have set
up task forces to explore the prob-
lems of alcohol abuse; news maga-
zines and television news are
devoting whole segments to find
out why young people drink.

Nobody can say why college stu-
dents like to drink so much. This
phenomenon can be blamed on
their upbringing, their pressures to
their need to feel
accepted. This debate could go on
for years, and no satisfactory expla-
nation would ever be given. _

I really didn’t think that young
people had any great problem until
I attended a convention for college
journalist in.Stf Louis last week-
end. Of course the students were
expected to drink; no classes, no
papers to be published; it was a
weekend of pure partying. «

What really struck me as odd was
the abuses these people placed on
their bodies over the weekend.
Imagine drinking until four or five
in the morning, getting up at eight
and having to attend seminars all
day long.

Through most of the weekend,
the students were walking around
with blood-shot eyes, dazed looks
and delicate stomachs, yet the next
night they went out and repeated
the performance.

On the second night of the con-
vention, a dance was thrown for the
student delegates. I’m sorry, but
would you take off your clothes
down to your underwear and dance

Israeli Cartoon Hurts Everyone

\ 7
1: «
/.'

Dear Editor:

I_am writing to express my sense
of shock and outrage at the cartoon
(“And the Winner is Israeli") that
appeared in The Pitt r\’ezu.s‘, Wed-
nesday, ()ct. 27. 1982.

‘Aside from the obvious carica-
ture of the ]ew—the hooked nose,
the beard and the gIasses—which
in the mind of this reader lends
itself to associations of “Shylock"
anti-semitism, and apart from the
l)ad taste of the cartoon, I)oth of
which are perhaps too obvious to
require comment. a couple ofother
remarks are in order.

The issue at stake is the self
image of the university and its per-
ception in the eyes of the commu-

 

before 600 strangers? Boy, that
takes guts.’

I hate to be accused—as I have
been in the past—of generalizing,
but many of these college students
(who, I’m shamed to admit, are
pursuing the same career as myself)
really acted like drunken fools
most of the weekend. Granted, this
was a convention in a city that’s in
bed by 9 p.m., but most people I
talked to said they drank exces-
sively at school also.

By the time my disillusionment
with college students was almost at
its highest point, I met two guys
who restored some of my faith in
people my own age and in my
colleagues.

Skip and Harry were from Old
Dominion University in Norfolk,
Va. Now, one would think that liv-
ing in Norfolk would be great

quality of our tithnic diversity,
interpersonal sensitivity and
shared “cues" on which we draw in
our intercultural relationships.
()ne of my activities is informal
work in the residence halls. such as
dorm ice cream parties. I have
always been struck in informal out-
reach by the implicit sense of
openness, mutuality and trust that
has characleri/.ed diverse student

cultures within the larger student‘

body. The spontaneity, the easy-
going lunnor and theggenuine curi-
osﬁy to learn more about others
with diffe'rent backgrounds have
been salient and admirable fea-
tures, representing a precious qual-
ity unique to oureti\'ir‘t)i1rii<'tit of

' *n'if‘?"-"P‘ii4FPFvi€l€S i{'8€I‘f~9H-{h@<$PeCI3~l-- - ~:rrn1'-rig,-» - --~ —- —~ - -......_.._._‘ __ c ,,-..,

cause to drink every night, but
these two’ guys did not indulge
themselves like most of us did.
Skip and Harry were from a dif-
ferent time. They knew how to
drink moderately; they didn’t drink
to get drunk but more to socialize.
At one point, I thought they were
from a different planet; they fin-
ished their first drink as I was start-

ing on my third beer. Colleg ..
students, especially men, aren't -1

supposed to act like that, are they?

I know many of you reading this
are in the same class as Skip and
Harry, so don’t take this column
personally. You should be admired
for your will power and strength; at
times I wish I could do that.

Skip and Harry did not fit the
mold of the “typical" 1982 college
student who attends Happy Hour
every Friday. One day, Skip asked, 7
me, “how can these people go out,
get drunk, pass out, walk around
hung over all the next day and start
again the next night? I just don’t
understand it.”

Although I’ve had that expe-

rience many times, I couldn’t giv ;.z

him an answer. Icouldn’t possibly
believe they were having. a good
time without drinking all the time,
but they were. Agood time without
alcohol? Man, they must be from
Mars.

So, here’s to Skip and Harry, the
two people who restoredsome of
my faith and also taught me a les-
son in maturity. I can only hope
that they haven't become disillu-
sioned by watching all the drunken
activities over the weekend.

Skip and Harry: this Bud's for
youl!

The damage that this type oli a
cartoon does has to l)e measured in
terms of its negative impact on that
precious and distinctive quality
which helps defin_e who are and the
values we reflect as a community.

I find The Pitt News" sudden
foray into the realm of interna-
tional politics through the cartoon
medium ironic in its subjectivity
and selectivity. If my premise i.

correct that (yrs is an organiccom— 4

Dear Editor:

It is student government election
time. Somehow, I don't feel a part
of all the hoopla, campaigning and
excitement. Maybe it is because I
am not a member of the Greek sys-
tem, a fraternity from which a
brother is running or one of the

,,,large student organizations who

ponsor candidates that support
their goals.

Whatever the reason, I couldn’t
help noticing the fraternal crowds
in the Towers Lobby on Monday at
the “Meet the Candidates” pro-
gram, cheering on their candidate.
There was one presidential candi-
date in his formal attire, sur-
rounded by his “brothers,”
strutting and exchanging the secret
handshake, looking like some
tough Italian gang leader whojust
beat up some scrawny punk. Do
you think I want him to be my
president?

I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn’t

ajudge characters and impressions.

Sigmund

Lingering in jail, Socrates
thinks all hope is gone. Little does
he know that his buddy, Sigmund
Freud, has gotten a job as a student
adviser in order to raise money for
Socrates’ bail.

The door slid slowly open, and a
pimply face emerged from behind
it. “Is this S. Freud’s office?” the
boy asked.

.‘‘just call me Siggy. Please come

 and lie on the couch. What’s

your name?”

“My name is Lawrence Denar-
row,” he replied.

“Well, Larry...”

“That’s Lawrence,” he snapped,
straightening the alligator on his
sweater.

“Yes, well....Larry, what type of
classes do you usually take?”

“Well, I love to study Applied
Multivariate Analysis!” he
exclaimed, leaping from the couch.

“What?” asked a surprised
Freud.

“Applied Multivariate Anal-
ysis.”

__“Why? What good will it do
fbu?” *

“It will prepare me for a reward-
ing future!” explained Lawrence.

“What do you call rewarding?” A
Freud asked, scribbling notes on
his tablet.

“Lots of money, house, car...”

“So multi...multivar...so this
course is your interest, and money
is your reward?” asked Freud.

“Sure, what’s wrong with that?”
questioned Lawrence, blowing his
nose.

“Do you have any fun?” Freud
asked.

“Sure. Why only yesterday,
while we were using our BMDP
package, Bruce used discriminate
analysis instead of cluster
analysis——ha! ha!—and screwed up

his whole program,” Lawrence

said, falling off the sofa in
Cjiysterics.

“Yes, well...uh,” continued

Freud. “Do you have a girlfriend?”

“No. Why do you ask?"

“Well, according to your records
you always take practical courses-
computer science and statisitics.
Nothing to do with people. You
don't get along with people very
well? Do you?” ,-

“Well..." Lawrence faltered.
“Can’t you see you’re suppres-
sing your libido by punching into
computers instead of releasing

your sexual frustrations?”

incredulously.

“You've become an extension of
your machine. Look, calculator in
your pocket-right next to your
heart—an obvious crying out of
your hidden lusts. Now tell me,
what do you think college is for?”

SGB Race Filled With Special Interest

Or should I? Isn't that what a
leader should have—a respectable
characte_r?

How about issues? Well it seems
that all these candidates can do is
talk about themselves or about the
government they are hoping to be
elected to. What about the stu-
dents? No, not the students who
participate in all of the activities,
but the students—the majority of
the undergraduates who, for some
reason, are not affiliated with an
organization. What are the candi-
dates going to do for us? (I count
myself among them.) They can talk
all they want about student govern-
ment liaisons, committee com-
munications, fundings and the
needs of special groups but until
they care about the needs of the
students, the real issue, we are not
going to care.

This is why the majority of the
students are apathetic. Student
government and its members don’t
care about the students’ needs.

lied a shaken Lawrence.

“Will this course prepare you for
life?”

“Sure, I’ll have a job,” said Law-
rence weakly.

“If there were no computers,
could you still handle life? Could
you get along with people?”

“Whadda ya mean?”

“Will your life be good? Will it
be satisfying?”

“Probably...”

“Without any friends, without
any computers?” Freud pressed.

“Probably not,” conceded Law-
rence, sweat pouring off his brow.

“Then why not take courses to
help you get along with people?”

“There are courses just for that?”
an awed Lawrence asked, sitting

up.

“Of course, there’s fine arts,
speech, philosophy...and
psychology.”

Until they do, things are not going
to change. These candidates don't
give much to hope for during the
coming year.

I find it disheartening to see stu-
dents take, without question, the
credentials of these candidates.

It appears that both presidential
candidates are members of Phi Eta
Sigma, the freshman honorary.
Have either of them been to a Phi
Eta Sigma meeting in the past year
or two or participated in the tutor-
ing program (required of every
member)? Are they really members?
Or are they two individuals who
paid the initiation dues in order to
have the right to profess to some
degree of “honorism” and “mem-
bership.” It is the latter, I am
afraid.

Are we also to be impressed that
they belong to fraternities? Mem-
bership in such social organiza-
tions does not automatically

bestow the qualities of leadership,‘

responsibility and character. There

“Sign me up!” shouted Law-
rence.

“What course?” asked Freud.

“What course do you think I
should take?"

“Well,” said Freud, “there’s this
course in psychology. It’s on this
famous psychologist and his theo-
ries on people’s behavior. He
explores their hidden lusts and
desires for sex in great detail.”

“Sounds kinky,” said a sweaty
(and getting sweatier) Lawrence.

“It’s a very satisfying course,”
said Freud.

“Who is this
asked Lawrence.

“Well...that’s all the time we
have,” interrupted Freud. “Come
back next week, and we’ll talk some
more. If you register before then,
take some classes that will broaden
your personality, not just your

The Pitt News, Wednesday November 3, 1982

are many who feel that such a “cre-
dential" is only detrimental.

One presidential candidate
claims that an increase in
number of teachers agreeing to be
evaluated indicates the impact
(success?) of his project as a board
member. Big deal! Did the students
he represents ever get to see those
evaluations? Were those results
ever made available? Was a booklet
prepared? A board member can do
all the work he wants, but if the
students can't get a single result, he
shouldn’t even bother to get credit
for nothing.

The other candidate looks to

. leadership style rather than expe-

E

rience as a credential. Nice try, no
good. A leadership style based on
communication will get him
nowhere in today’s student govern-
ment. Witness the past years‘ can-
didates. A pledge to do things for
students and get things done by
addressing real student needs is
what is needed from a candidate.

Changes Made in 13th 
Annual Black Week

Everything from music and
theater to the appearance of
nationally recognized black lead-
ers will be included in the 13th
annual Black Week, sponsored
by the Black Action Society,
from Sunday, Nov. 7 through
Saturday, Nov. 13.

The title for this year’s Black
Week is “Identity...A Means of
Self-Expression.” According to
Carla Frost, programming chair-
person of the Black Action
Society, the theme is an appro-
priate one because the guest
speakers have found the road to
success through self-identity and
from that they can relate to
audiences.

Speakers will include Eleanor
Holmes Norton, chairperson of
Equal Employment Opportunity
Committee under the Carter
Administration; Gil Scott-Heron;
Poetess Nikki Giovanni; Julian
Bond and Dr. Alvin Pouissant, a
Harvard psychiatrist.

Starting off the week-long
events will be a Gospel After-
noon, featuring the Howard Uni-
versity Gospel Choir and Pitt’s
own gospel choir, Some of God’s
Children. In the past, this event

was held Monday night, but the
programmers chose to move it
back to Sunday so that Black
Week would be extended to
seven days.

BLACK ACTION

    

SOCIETY

Other changes include the
addition of a bazaar at Forbes
Quadrangle on Nov. 10, some-
thing not offered last year. It will
be a combination of a flea-
market, ethnic food sales and
artists and photographers dis-
playing and selling their work.

The Kuntu Repertory Thea-
tre, though recently sponsored
at Pitt by the society, will appear
again. Under the direction of Dr.
Vernell Lillie, the group will pre-
sent “I am a Black Woman.” Pie- ._
ces of a Dream, a jazz band dis-‘ii
covered by Grover Washington,
.Jr., will also be performing.

The events will come to a close
on Nov. 13, with the annual Total
Social, an evening of dancing and
games.

Frost referred to Black Week
as “the major unifying event for
blacks at Pitt in a given year.”

According to Frost, Black
Week “sets aside a time where all
blacks, students, faculty and
staff can come together as one
and partake in the activities
scheduled for the week as well as
to receive words of wisdom from

various blacks who've made it in 

the professional and entertain-
ment fields.”

She also expressed a concern
over a common misinterpreta-
tion of Black Week. People
assume that it is just for blacks
only, but everyone is welcome at
all of the events.

Black Action Society Opens Doors%

Partlelpatlen in the Black Action
Society is at its highest level ever,
according to chairman Bruce Rog-
ers. “Students are becoming more
unified. They’re looking for group
support,” he said.

Deputy chairman Kevin Nelson
said that the reason for student
unity is that various programs such
as affirmative action are being cut,
necessitating the need for students
to work together.

“Black activism decreased in the
last few years due to the conserva-

tive trend, but now attitudes are
going back to where they were 10
years ago,” he said. “A lot of student
groups, including the Black Action
‘Society, are getting more
outspoken.”

Both Rogers and Nelson said that
the Black Action Society has
changed a lot in the last few years.
According to Nelson, the society
was started 14 years ago for the pur-
pose of increasing black awareness
of politics, academics and culture.

“The Black Action Society

Wuslich Photo

became more active in the social
aspects after the mid ’70s. lt’s only
this year that we’ve been able to get
back to its original purpose,” said
Nelson.

“Politically, we keep black stu-
dents abreast on what’s happening
in the black community,” Rogers
said.’

The society is trying to get more
exposure by making students aware
of its existence through a variety of
programs. This year they had a ﬂoat
in the Homecoming parade for the
first time. Although the float, which
was made in conjunction with the
Black Greek Council, didn’t win a
prize, Rogers said, “We felt we won
a prize just by being in the parade.”

“In the past, students haven’t
heard too much about us besides
Black Week, but we doa lot of other
things,” said Rogers.

Besides the “Get Aquainted
Weekend” in September and the
Charles Moore Dance Ensemble in
October of this year, the society is
planning a reception in January
between Nigerian-African students
and black American students. “The
purpose of this reception,” said Rog-
ers, “is to strengthen the bond
between the two groups.”

According to Nelson, all black
students at Pitt are automatically
members of the Black Action
Society. Those who wish to become
active can pick up membership
cards at the Society’s office at 625
S.U., which will entitle them to vote
for positions of chairman and co-
chairman.

“The white student body doesn’t
know that all of our programs are
open to everyone and they’re all
free,” said Rogers.

Although Rogers said he noticed
a very low percentage of white stu-
dents at the society’s programs, he
said that they do turn out for politi-
cal functions. 

The committees which comprise
the Black Action Society are: the
Basics Committee, which acts as a
liaison between the society and the

Kevin Nelson

community at large, the Political
Action Committee, which keeps
students informed about candidates
running for the Student Govern-
ment Board and other elections; the
Public Relations Committee, which
has appeared on television; the
Steering Committee and a commit-
tee_ that puts out a monthly journal.

Among the goals Rogers sees for
the society are a program or guest
speaker geared to black athletes
and a reception between the Black
Action Society and the campus
police.

“There s been some bad feelings
between us due to police harass-
ment of black students, but now
we’re working closely with William
Tucker, the new police chief,” said
Rogers.

Because “black students at Pittgil

are going to be the future leaders in
their communities,” Rogers said it's
important for the society to pull eve-
ryone together. “I feel that if we
work together we can produce a
higher rate of black graduates," he

said.

Now it's easy at The Tower. A condomin-
ium at Chatham Center. Because we've
developed a plan that, in conjunction
with the Economic Recovery Act of 1981,

makes it possible for buyers of condo-1

miniums to create tax losses when renting
those condominiums to relatives or co-
owners.

The plan also permits accelerated
depreciation, which allows the owner of
a rental property to write off its value in
15 years instead of 25 to 40 years. That
means a king-sizeannual tax deduction
for your parents. And best of all, a beau-
tiful apartment home for you at The Tower.

With a private doorman to greet you 24.

hours a day. And an elegant hospitality
lounge where you can study, or just relax.

  
  
  

As a resident of The Tower, you'll have
special privileges to the Chatham Hyatt
Health Club, where you can start your
day with a workout, sauna or swim.

And all this is waiting for you in the
heart of Pittsburgh's dynamic Renais-
sance ll. Convenient to school and just
minutes from shopping, dining and excit-
ing nighttime entertainment.

So what are you waiting for? Now,
instead of asking for more money, you
can write home and tell your parents
how to get in on some major tax and
equity benefits.

They'll be very impressed with all that
you've learned.

Spikers Waiting For Rematch With Penn State

Julie Gaul and the Lady Panther volleyball team are looking forward to a rematch

with Penn State.

Can Pitt Compete In Big East?

By IRA M. KATZ

Patience is the key word if you
are a follower of the 1982-83 Pan-
ther basketball squad.

Coach Roy Chipman faces some
new challenges in his third full sea-
son as the Panther coach.

A move from the Eastern 8 to the
Big East conference will match Pitt
against some of the toughest corn-
petition in the land—Georgetown,
Villanova, Boston College, Syra-
cuse and St. }ohn’s.

In joining the Big East, Pitt
gains a major television package
that will provide the basketball
program with a great deal of new
revenue. The exposure will no
doubt enhance Pitt's recruiting.

The Panthers entered training
camp with two related concerns—-
rebounding and lack of size at the
center position.

“I think things are progressing
well," Chipman said. "We have a
lot of young players and we are
doing a lot of work fundamentally
and in conditioning. -

“We want them to do things
maybe a little different than they
did in high school," Chipman
added. “I think everybody is work-
ing hard, and we’re making pro-
gress at this point."

In 1980, Chipman came to Pitt
with ideas of turning a lackluster
basketball program into a national
power.

He is presently on schedule. In
his first two years at Pitt, heguided
the Panthers to as many Eastern 8
championships and NCAA tour-
nament bids.

Chipman's past coaching record
has been marked with winners.
Before coming to Pitt, he was coach
at Lafayette University, a program
that had a limited number of scho-
larships to offer.

There, (Jhipman led the Leo-
pards to a 60-28 record over three
years and to two Eastern Confer-
ence Championships.

Chipman is currently trying to
lay down a winning philosophy to
his players.

“I think the older players are
helping,” Chipman said, adding,
“we have quite a few players back.

‘It’s just a matter of them teaching

the game to the younger players.”

The Panthers are building their
team around forward Clyde
Vaughan, who averaged 18.5
points and 19.5 rebounds per game
last year.

This year, Chipman hopes to
have solved one problem that
plagued his club last year by
recruiting highly-touted 6-9 center
Keith Armstrong. Many college
scouts compare Armstrong to
former Panther star center Sam
Clancy.

“They are fairly different—type
ballplayers,” Chipman said. “Both
are strong rebounders. Keith has
the ability and certainly the wil-
lingness to play."

The Panthers will also rely on
sophomore forward Andre Willi-
ams, who played out of position
last year at center. Williams is com-
ing off a knee injury that he suf-
fered last season.

“Everybody is working real hard
because they know it is going to be
tougher in the Big East than the
Atlantic 10 (Eastern 8)," Williams
said.

“We are two or three years away
from reaching the Top 10," Willi-
ams added. “Realistically, we are
shooting at a .500 season this year.

Over the years, Pitt has encoun-
tered a problem in recruiting local
talent. This season, Chipman
wanted to establish a new trend. He
signed joey David of Upper St.
Clair High School, who figures to
step in and contribute immediately
at guard. ‘ ‘ '

“I'm learning in pre—season that
the game is more physical and fas-
ter at this level of competition,”
David said.

“Other than Clyde Vaughan,’
Chipman said, "_]oey is the best
shooter on the ballclub.

Some experts have predicted Pitt
will finish fifth or sixth in the Big
East this year.

“That doesn’t bother us because
I see us finishing around third or
fourth," Vaughan said.

“I don't think we would be satis-
fied with a .500 record,” said Chip-
man, adding, “As a goal this year,I
look for us to try and win 15 to 16
ballgames.”

"It will build our confidence if
we can win as an underdog in this
conference,” said sophomore for-
ward Chip _Watkins. “I think we
will finish third, which would
qualify us for a bid to a tournament
in all probability.”

“I believe playing against better
competition is going to help as a
team,” senior forward Trent John-
son said. “We just have to stay
together as a team though the weak
times of the season when every-
thing isn't going so great.”

The strength of this edition of
the Panther basketball team will
depend on the players who can
depart from the bench and contril)-
ute to the attack. Enter, freshman
guard Bryan Mitchell.

“He is the best physically tal-
ented player we have," Chipman
said. “He is going to contribute
this year."

“We have a lot of depth and we
will utilize that by running,"
Chipman said. “We are going to
run more and try to wear down
teams."

Still, Pitt must improve in cer-
tain areas if it expects to be compet-
itive in the Big East. This isn't the
Eastern 8.

“Charles Thompson didn’t play
with the kind of intensity last year
we are going to have to get out of
him, " Chipman said. “We have to
rebound-—we’ve got to come tip

“with some rebounds."

Pitt will not only be playing top
caliber competition from the Big
East as well as former Eastern 8
rivals like Duquesne and West Vir-
ginia. Notre Dame is also on this
year's schedule.

By MARK A. SINDLEAR

The Lady Panther volleyball
team visits Penn State tonight for
the conclusion of a three-match
series.

‘The series began in September
when the Lady Panthers decisively
defeated the Lady Lions at Fitz-

‘geral Fieldhouse. The results were

the same when Pitt met Penn State
several weeks later.

That October win, however, was
accomplished without stars Ulana
Kohutiak and Robin Kukalis —
both were out with injuries.

Now, as Pitt’s 35-5 storybook
season nears its end, it may be
somewhat difficult for the Lady
Panthers to muster up enough bite
to chew up Penn State for an
unblemished 3-0 mark on the year.

Since their previous meetings,
Pitt has been graced with more
than ample success. It has not come
easily, but the squad has risen to

the challenge. There have been .

matches against the familiar faces
as well as new opponents with
unfamiliar lineups.

Pitt has strafed its foes with pin-
point accuracy. The evidence: six
tournament championships.

7'  // / 4;

Clyde Vaug‘han

A physically demanding season
has taken its toll, however. Coach
Shelton Collier told of a less
impressive practice session
Monday.

“It's been a long season,” he
explained. “We have some people
burned out as a result of the hard
competition and studying.”

As a result, Collier has scheduled
six more practices prior to the Big
East championships next weekend.

Big Easts aside, the matter at
hand is Penn State.

“Everytime we meet, the match
is always a showcase event,” Col-

lier said of the Penn State contests. ‘

“There is a great deal at stake —

saying that you are No. 1 in the "

East and bragging rights.”

“But,” Collier continued, “the
rivalry is not crucial now. This
match is looked upon as another
preparation for us.”

“Penn State has to win just out
of pride — they have already lost
twice. Whatever the outcome,
though, I want us to be the better
team after the match is over rather
than before.".

That has been Collier’s postulate
all season.

Pitt Gains T op Spot

After falling from its No. l preseason ranking in both the Asso-
ciated Press and United Press International polls, the Pitt Panthers
recaptured that postition in this week’s polls.

The Panthers, who dropped in the polls because of less than
inspiring offensive performances, returned to the top spot in the AP
poll last week after previous No. 1 Washington struggled past
Texas Tech. Pitt passed Washington in the UPI poll this week, not
necessarily on the strength of its 63-14 victory over Louisville, but
rather on the Huskies’ 43-31 loss to Stanford.

Pitt puts its ranking on the line this Saturday against Notre
Dame. Washington faces PAC-l0 rival UCLA.

By CHARLIE O'HARA

[As workouts for the indoor
track season are beginning, so is
the college coaching career of
new sprint and hurdle coach
Steve Lewis.

After coaching at Menchvill.
he came in contact with
Panther track coach john Vas-
vary, who brought Lewis to Pitt
a little over a month and a half
ago.

Within the last six weeks,
Lewis had his runners working
out with the cross country team
to build endurance for the track
season.

“I am very pleased with the
attitude and effort put forth by
everyone involved. Much prog-
ress has been made,” Lewis
said.

“I see myself as being a part 01
a track program that will soon
be among the nation's elite. It is
just a matter of time,” he said.

Lewis hopes to recruit some
of the football team’s talented
athletes to augment the versatil-
ity of the team.

“Roger Kingdom is the best
hurdler in the school. We’re
working on having Dwight
Collins and Tim Lewis (both
members of the Panther foot-
ball team) comeout this spring,
but nothing is final. Some bas-
ketball players have shown
interest. They could make the
emergence of our program that
much quicker.”

“The ingredients are here at
Pitt right now,” Lewis said.
“We are forming a strong foun-
dation with a group of very tal-
ented runners.”

Both \"as\'ary and Lewis have
been learning a great deal in
recent weeks.

“For Coach Lewis and
myself, each week is a learning
experience that we must try to
benefit from," Vasvary said.
“This experience will enable
the individuals to learn more
about themselves because we
will be more able to identify
with their strengths.”

Vasvary said that the individ-
ual improvements made during
the cross country season were
necessary in developing the
team strength that he believes
will be there next year.

“These improvements will
also give confidence to those
that will be contributing in
track," he said.

Lewis and Vasvary have, on
numerous occasions, expressed
much optimism, which is
backed by a group of runners
who have a desire to achieve
success.

The first competition is ten-
tatively scheduled for the first
week of December when West
Virginia hosts an indoor meet.

-The team should be ready to

start competing—or at least
ready to give a good indication
of just what lies ahead for them.

As it stands now, Collier des-
 cribes the team as being in a “lux-

ury position." “Normally," he

said, “I would call the school for
scouting reports, injury updates
and things like that. This time it’s
different. Ordinarily, we would
fight it outtooth and nail."

Collier surely is looking to hang
a defeat on Penn State at Happy
Valley. In fact, he says that he
“wants to beat them badly." He
remembers the sting suffered last
season. It has been almost one year
since Pitt played Penn State last,

school ranks have kept reminding

Collier of the 0-3 drubbing the
team suffered last season.
This year's objective:
these numbers around.
Penn State is currently 16-9,
which is not particularly excep-
tional, but they are riding a 10-
match win streak—including vic-

tories over five nationally ranked
schools.

The Lady Panthers have scaled

Early Birds In Action

By MARK STROUP

They weren’t selling Grateful
Dead tickets at Schenley Hall last
night. However, a much more
subdued, but just ‘as dedicated
crowd waited some nine hours for
the Pitt-Penn State football tickets
to go on sale.

By 11 p.m., 33 people were lined
for the tickets that went on sale at 7
a.m. this morning.

Kevin McCarthy, political

science major at Pitt. ‘vas first in

line. McCarthy said he had exams
in the morning, and if he could
“forget about the noise level,”
waiting would be a good way to
stay awake and cram.

With each person allowed a
maximum of two tickets, the
alloted tickets should be sold by
now. When asked if they would
give up their spots if none else was
going to show up till seven, all
gave a rousing “No!”...well, if not
rousing, considering the circum-
stances, heartfelt.

Pitt e— Notre Dame game
on TV. . .

WPCH-TV (Channel 53) will
televise the Pitt-Notre Dame game
on Saturday. The game will be
shown within a 45-mile radius of
Pittsburgh.

According to associate athletic
director Dean Billick, one of the
problems with getting the appro-
val to televise the game was the
of cable systems
between 45 and 120 miles of
Pittsburgh.

The two networks———ABC and
CBS—both declined to show the
game. CBS received first choice of
time spot and they took the later
time spot. Since Pitt Stadium
couldn't get lights in a short period
of time and Three Rivers Stadium
was out due to the number of
tickets sold, CBS was unable to take
the game.

ABC has the early spot this week,
but refused to televise the contest
since they plan to broadcast the
Penn State game on Nov. 26. That

John Brown

would be the second time the
Panthers would be onnational tel-
evision this season, the maximum
allowed for one network in a
season.

The Pitt injury list for Saturday
still remains long. Out for the
Notre Dame game are defensive
end Michael Woods, tight end

Now it’s easy at Calais Village
Condominium. Because we’ve devel-
oped a plan that, in conjunction with
the Economic Recovery Act of 1981,
makes it possible for buyers of con-
dominiums to create tax losses when
renting those condominiums to rela-
tives or co-owners.

The plan also permits acceler-
ated depreciation, which allows the
owner of a rental property to write
off its value in 15 years instead of
25 to 40 years. That means a king-
size annual tax deduction for your
parents. And best of all, a beautiful
apartment home for you at Calais
Village featuring:

o Heated outdoor swimming pool
with adjoining bathhouse 0 Saunas

  
 
   
  
  

o Lighted tennis court 0 Private
heated indoor parking 0 Comfort-
ably furnished entertainment
rooms with wide-screen TV_, custom
made billiard table, card tables, and
cocktail bar 0 Picnic and barbeque
areas 0 Commuter transportation at
your front door

So what are you waiting for? Now,
instead of asking for more money,
you can write home and tell your
parents how to get in on some major
tax and equity benefits.

   

They’ll be very impressed with all
that you’ve learned.

Visit our Sales Center from 10 am to 7 pm Monday
through Friday, 10 am to 6 pm Saturday, and 11 am
to 6 pm Sunday.

Directions: North on Route 19. pass Pines Plaza Shopping
Center onto Highland Road (just before the water tower).
Left on Highland to Sloop Road. Left on Sloop Road to
