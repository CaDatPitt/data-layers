School Of Engineering To Give
Banquet Commemorating
Establishment At Pitt

By Bernard Zerbe
A banquet celebrating the twenty-

fifth anniversary of the establishment.
of the School of Engineering on theI

present campus will be held Friday,
November 2, at the Hotel Schenley.
The banquet will precede the annual.
alumni homecoming celebrat.ion spon-
sored by the Alumni association.

Directly after the dinner, short talks
will be given by Samuel A_ Taylor,
consulting engineer of tlie Iron City
.E=7lectric company; Charles W’. Riding-
er, president of the Iron City Electric
company; and S_ M, Kintner, vice
president of the Westinghouse Elec-
tric company and former professor of
electrical engineering at the Univer-
Dr_ F. L. Bishop, professor of
physics in the School of Engineering
will be toastmaster. Dr. Bishop will
review the high points in the prog-
ress of the School of Engineering and
Mines during the last 25 years.

One of the first in the United States,
the School of Engineering was estab-
lished in 1865, but degrees in Engi-
neering were ﬁrst awarded in 1842. At
the time of its establishment the
school was situated on Perrysville
avenue, In 1909 the School of Engi-
neering and the School of Mines were
mover to their present sites on the
campus. '

The School of Mines was established
in 1895 by an act of state legislature,
but the ﬁrst course and curriculum,
arranged by H. C. George, genera.l
chairman of the banquet and head of
the department of oil a.nd gas, was be-
gun in 1904. According to the act of
the legislature the School of Mines
was established “for the purpose of
establishing in connection with the
School of Engineering a department to
be known as the VVestern Pennsyl-
vania School of Mines and Mining
Engineering with the object of thor-
oughly educating capable men in the
principles and art of mining and min-
ing engineering in a region included
within the on; gas. and bituminous
coal ﬁelds of this commonwealth."

Notices of the banquent have been
sent out to all alumni in connection
with the notices sent out for the Gen-
eral Alumni association homecoming.

1938 Class Takes
Psychology Tests

Annual Freshman Examinations
Scheduled Thursday

*1-‘sychology examinations required
of all entering freshmen will be given
at 3:45 o’clock Thursday afternoon,
according to Dr. Omar C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of the col-
lege.

Students enrolled in College A or
B groups will take the tests in the

-banquet room of Memorial hall; pre-

education students in Room 817, Ca-
thedral, and those in the School of
Business Administration in Room 315.
Alumni hall. The tests will be admin-
istered by Dr. John H_ McFadden, Dr.
George Ellis Jones, and Mrs. J. Bat-
ley Rhinehart of the department of
psychology.

The purpose of the examinations, ac-
cording to Dr. Held, is to secure in-
formation about students’ capacities
as a supplement to that received from
high schools. Results of the tests
are used as aids in student guidance.

Students are graded on a percentage
basis. A grade of 98 per cent means
the student has done better than 97
per cent of his class. Held’s statistics
indicate a general rise in average re-
sults of the tests during the last few
years, but no adequate hypothesis by
which the rise can be explained has
been offered.

New Football Line-up:
Math Wizards vs.
. Pitt Gridders

If you haven’t been able to secure
a ticket for the Pitt-U.S.C. game,
don’t let that put you down. The
mathematicians offer you the oppor-
tunity to regale yourself in their
company; in fact, instead of a mere
afternoon of football thrills, you are
given the opportunity of the rhapsody
Iof a full day of higher mathematcs.

The Allegheny mountain section of
the mathematical association
America is to hold its regular fall
meeting at Grove City college, Satur-
day, October 13. The morning ses-
Ision will begin at 10:30 o’clock, with
,the afternoon session starting at 2
o’clock. The program includes pa-
pers running all the way from “Math-
ematics and Character Education” to
“’.l"he Vibrational Motions of Hydro-
lcarbon Chains.”
| In commenting on the meeting, Dr.
‘J. S. Taylor, secretary-treasurer of

Ithe organization, expressed regret
Ithat the mathematicians will miss
USC game, but explained that the

date of meeting was arranged early
last year, and that all attempts to ef-
fect a change had proved fruitless.
When asked if he had requested the
athletic department to check with the
matliematicians before making up fu-
ture football schedules in order that
such conﬂicts might be avoided here-
after, and the danger of small foot-
ball attendance removed, Dr. Taylor
said that he preferred not to be
quoted in this connection.

Latin Dictators I
Subject Of Talk

Cleven Will Call Leaders
Politicians In Address

Dr.

  

Promising to reveal the secrets of
seven past and present dictators of
Latin America, Dr. N. Andrew N.
Cleven, professor of history, will ad-
dress the International club at its
weekly dinner-in Chapin’s penthouse
tomorrow evening.

Simon Bolivar, the Washington of
South America; Fraucia, the myster-
ious doctor of Paraguay; Manuel de
Rosas of Argentine; Garcia Moreno.
of Ecuador; Carlos Gomez of Vene-I
zuela; Ibenez of Chile, and the bloodyI
dictator of Mexico, Porfiro Diaz, will'
each be discussed during the evening.

Commenting on their success, Dr.
Cleven said:

“These men were a product of the
times. Most of them rose to power
through sly political maneuvering. In
the case of Diaz and Gomez, the
United States contributed support.

“In fact, these dictatorships were
logical considering the Latin Amer-
ican’s belief that change can be
brought about only through revolu-
tions.” .

Concerning the success of closer
cooperation between South American
countries, Dr, Cleven explained:

“I see no union in the near future.
So intensely nationalistic are those 20
republics that little hope can be ex-
pressed for the fulﬁllment of Bolivar’s
dream——the United States of Latin
America.”

Settlement of the 'Chaco-Boreal strife
between Bolivia and Paraguay to thr-.
satisfaction of both parties seems
doubtful, ,Dr, Cleven believes.

“It’s a question of honor,” he said.
“Both countries have too much at
stake.”

‘Fashion’ Tryouts
Scheduled Today

Players To Choose 1850 Comedy
As First Play Of Season

- I

 

Try—outs for the ﬁrst major produc-
tion of the Pitt Players’ season,
“Fashion,” will be held this after-
ernoon in Room 315 from 3:30 to 5
o’clock, Carl B. Cass, director, an-
nounced today. Reserve and active
members of the organization, as well
as new members who participated in
preliminary tryouts last week, will be
eligible.

Encouraged by the success of the
recent productions of “The Drunkard”
in New York and on the west coast,

ﬂowery melodramas of the nineteenth
century. In recognition of this new
trend, the Players have chosen as
their ﬁrst play a ﬁve-act satiric com-
edy of the period when every heroine
had blonde curls and a hard life and
every villain (curses on him) sported
a long black mustache and a furtive
slink. “Fashion; 01' Life in New‘
York,” the play to be cast next week,
wa.s written by Anna Cora Mowatt
and ﬁrst produced in New York City
in 1850.

According to the director, the melo-
drama will be staged in true Delsa.r-
tian style with eleborate gestures, or-
nate -scenery and the costumes of the
period. Entre acts of old-time vau-
deville will entertain the audience
during the changing of scenery.

Thecast of the play calls for 13
characters, eight men and five wo-
men. Although he declares it will
not bias his casting, Cass has admitt-
ed that his fondest ambition is to
get four ﬁne singing voices in the
ca.st so the ma.le quartette can ren-
der “Oh Why Did They Dig Mother’s
Grave So Deep” between the third and
fourth acts.

That women should be repre-
sented on this important commit-
tee is now clearer than ever as
the semester begins. In function
the Executive committee has be-
come the active agent of student
government, responsible to the
rest of the University Assembly.
The Executive committee will
have met three times, will have
considered policies and elaborated
a semester program, before the
Assembly ever meets as a body,
at a dinner meeting October 16.

Distinctly, women students
should have a part in student
government other than the indi-
rect inﬂuence which good women
are traditionally supposed to
have over good men.

The fathers of the present stu-
dent - government constitution
never intended, it is safe to say,
to omit women from the Execu-
tive committee. But Women were
not in the thick of last spr1ng’s
political jamboree. They com-
pleted elections to their own or-
ganizations and then looked up to
ﬁnd the Executive committee of
the University Assembly, in a
manner of speaking, composed.

' Tomorrow the committee should
pick a junior or senior woman for
the vacancy. It would do well to
consider an amendment to the
constitution to the eﬁect that the
president of VVSGA should auto-
matically become a member of the
Executive committee. The move
would unite the two campus gov-

. erning bodies. And it would place

the representation of wom en
above future political hurly-
burlies.

BULLETIN OF the League for
Industrial Democracy declares

that during the past year and since
the beginning of this semester an in-
creasing concern with problems of
social signiﬁcance has been shown in
undergraduate editorial columns.

In evidence of this view the
bulletin presents a series of extracts
from college papers as widely sep-
arated as The Daily Californian and
The Hunter Bulletin which indicate
that an American student movement
is slowly crystallizing:

“Concerning Herbert Hoover's re-
cent defense of Liberty, The Daily
Californian, right in Mr. Hoover's own
backyard comments: ‘A vast casualty
to liberty, he calls it! Liberty to
whom? Liberty to the starving mass-
es of Americans who suffered under
Hoover, the engineer who thought
more of the starving Belgians than he
did of his own fellow citizens? Lib-
erty to the seven-eights of the Amer-
ican people who own but one-eight
of the nation’s wealth? Liberty for
the 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 men who
are without jobs?’

“The Syracuse Daily Orange: ‘We
believe that this system has reached a
point of diminishing returns and that
we are living in an age of transition.
We are at once witnessing the rise
of a new society on the pyre of our
own. Our protest is merely an in-
dication of the despair and discon-
tent which is everywhere. More than
that, we have attempted to show this
decline and the reason for it. life
have especially attempted to (lemon-

strate that war is inherent in the
system.’
“The Minnesota Daily: ‘While not

exactly advocating his substitute for
a uniform, we can hardly do better
than recommend to drill students the
methods of the world greatest living
statesman and pacifist, Mahatma
Gandhi. A well—planned and deter.
mined policy of passive resistance
would make an unmistaken impres-
sion on the minds of administrators.
The power to abolish the imposition
of compulsory drill does, we believe,

lie in the hands of University stu-
dents,’ '

“The Carletonian: ‘One recalls
longingly the German student move-
ment of 1815-1818 with its high pas-
sion for liberty, the Austrian student
movement of 1848, its alliance with
workingmen, its tragic defeat, In the
United States college students have
but begun to meditate these things.
They can determine that wars» shall
not come.’

“Hunter Bulletin: ‘As an uncensor-
ed college publication interested in
the non-censorship of other college
publications, we protest the arbitrary
action taken by the Barnard Student
Council in setting up a board of cen-
sorship over Barnard Bulletin.’

“Daily Northwestern: ‘Out here we
look like a university, but we func-
tion like a country club. We are a
bit afraid to think, because it is so
much easier to dance. Intellectuaily
we are walking in our sleep. We
are more concerned with stunts than
with education. We are a university
of prodigics, championships, beauty
queens, night clubs, proms, f_rolics and
church sup-orters. Educationally we
aren’t so much, but as promoters and
publicity hounds we do pretty well.
VVe have been getting by on our beau-
tiful lake shore, basking serenely in
the protection of the four-mile limit.
As :1 ﬁnishing school we rate highly.”

The terms, “left.” “radical,” liberal,”
are all too gassy and all too inaccu-
rate for the expressions of these
young men and women. Their social
criticisms have a tremenduosly pro-
phetic ring, like the social criticisms
of Boston merchants in the 1770’s
now seem to us to have had_

Orchids To You

2 OME SORT OF A guerdon is due
i the University offices and organ-

izations which are the ordinary
sources of copy for the Pitt News, as
,this newspaper pushes into the third
lweek of publication on the journalistic
wings of more than a score of new
reporters,

The call to high achievement comes
too infrequently in human life and
when a freshman assures us that he
is of the stuff of Pegler, Essary and
Brisbane we naturally try to be con-
vinced. We are particularly anxious
to be convinced that 1938 contains a
few star-fated individuals, as we go
into the -rollicking business of being
the University’s best tri-weekly.

Necessarily, some of these new re-
porters are not the spiritual inheritors
of Pegler, Essary and Brisbane;
meanwhile, those that may be just
such have to go about the long bus-
iness of trial and error, while ink
and type preserve their various at-
tainments until the next issue of the
Pitt News.

Indeed there is no logical gap be-
tween the trial-and-error experience
of new reporters and the experience
of much greater ﬁgures on the Pitt
News. The temptation comes over us
to mention some of the blunders of
copyreaders and executives, with
douses of rich and personal confes-
sion.

Yet confession hardly serves the
purpose of a guerdon. Shall it be
, orcliids—to-you?

Thinking It Over -

By Edwin Banks

 

LIATEVER CONCESSIONS TO LABOR may have been whittled
away by recent interpretations of Section 7a of the National In-
dustrial Recovery act, the section itself has, it seems to me, accom-

plished one important end in the
man.
least a decade.

cause of the organized working-

It has made him more self-conscious than he has been for at

There were crucial strikes before the NIRA was conceived and

Labor and Section 7a ‘v‘
the AFofL made periodic speeches
and staged demonstrations: so too,

did lesser unions But since the col-
lective bargaining clause has written
on the books, American labor has
steadily broken into the headlines,
and impressive headlines they have
been, San Franisco had its economic
heart suspended for weeks, New Kons-
ington and Ambridge in our own state
had some fun for a while, the textile
strike concluded—temporai‘ily at least
-—paralyz'ed one of the greatest indus-
tries in the nation, and there are
other innumerable examples.

Straws are in the wind to the effect
that the administration is inclining a
more willing ear to industrialists in
its present policy toward the rela-
tions between labor and capital. Per-
mission of the company union was, of
course, the ﬁrst great shock that la-
bor union men received. They had
been taught to expect that “guaran-
teeing labor the right to bargain col-
lectively with their employers”
meant something entirely different.
But they have learned-that a vaguely
phrased part of a statute, like the
famous fourteenth amendment to the
Constitution, can turn into the mm-cTst
amazing sententious body of guaran-
tees or restrictions—in the hands of
judicial interpreters. .

Only -Friday Donald Richberg, the
new dictator of a somewhat subdued
type of NRA, was quoted as saying
that the administration will “protect
the rights of individuals and minority
groups in collective bargaining” and

that “no effort will be made to force
minorities to yield to the will of ma-
jorities in plant elections.”
IN OTHER ‘NORDS the administra-

tion has at last perceived that
democracy is a failure and that the
will of the majority should no longer
control governing policy——at least in
industry when the AFofL or some.
other labor union has the votes of
most of the employes.

VVell, it's all very complicated. And
pretty much of a mess. The strikes
have caused a lot of anguish and trou-
ble, strikers have been shot, and
probably everybody concerned has lost
money. The union apparently under-
took a policy of aggression, because
they believed the President was pull-
ing for them. The industrials appar-
ently met passive
force because they believed the Presi-
dent would not dare push too much
against them.

Labor leaders now can scratch
their heads and wonder with Vvilliam
Green, when he read Richberg’s state-
ment: “VVell, what do you think of
that? It’s hard to believe.”

AND THE NATIONAL l\«Ianufactur-

ers’ association incidentally,
approved the President’s last radio
talk, that part at least which referred
to private property and individual in-
itiative. The distinguishing elements
of ecomic arrangements, which have
made America. the great country it is
today. are still to be protected. Per-
haps the American Liberty league will
be able to take a breather now for a
while,

The vital question, as far as this
is concerned. is has organized labor
gained anything under the NIRA. The
administration after a liberal begin-
ning seems to be veering off to the
right. The strikes for the most part
don’t appear to have gained the work-
ers any material beneﬁt.

This one fact, though, is, I think,
true. The NRA. which was created

for the purpose of conciliating labor.

anrl capital, has succeded chieﬂy in
making class lines cut more sharply
than ever before‘ in our history. It
has succeeded, more so than ‘Commu-
nists and other radical agitators. in
grouping the American workingmen
together, and saying: “You are La
bor.”

The American workingman_ then, to
~'r-,oeat, is more self—conscious than he
has been for a long time. This fact
should mean one thing if no more: la-
bor will probably vote_ to a consider-
able degree, as labor, not as Republi-
can or Democrat.

Politicians drawing up platforms
please notice.

Dr. Weber To Study Chemistry
At Munich University

Dr, H. Henry R. Weber, who re-

try last August, has arrived in Munich
to begin his chemistry research at the
University of Munich, according to
word received here yesterday.

Dr. Vveber was awarded a scholar-
ship by the Ame-rican-German Student
exchange of the Institute of Interna-
tional Education, New York. He will
study under Dr. Henry W'ieland,
Nobel prize winner in biochemistry
and well-known in the ﬁeld of bio-
logical chemistry,

After receiving his Bachelor of Sci-
ence degree at the University of Illi-
nois, Dr_ Weber was associated with
the Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search, first as fellowship assistant
and -later as Industrial Fellow. He
then became graduate assistant in the
department of chemistry here under
Dr. C. G. King.

His research consisted of investi-
gation of enzymes, He presented his
work with that of Dr. Velma Baker at
the Cleveland meeting of the Ameri-
can Chemical society September 12.

Princeton Will Build I
New Humanistic
L i b r a r y

A new library will be built at
Princeton university which will not
only house the‘ books for student and
faculty research, but in the words of
President Harold W. Dodds, “It is
conceived as a workshop which will
be a community center of the kind a
university should have; a place Where
men may read, discuss, think and—-
when they are 'ready—write.

This “humanistic library,” as it
has been called, will provide the need-
ed easy meeting ground for students
and teachers, a sort of ‘laboratory in
which the materials and apparatus
will be books. Around the sides of
the central stack area will be grouped
three floors. Undergraduate and
graduate study rooms, arranged as
departmental units, will be grouped
on these three ﬂoors.

richly-furnished lounges, seminar
rooms and faculty offices near the
books of each department. On each

tier floor of the stacks there will be
about 200.000 books relative to that
department.

With the offices for faculty ment
bers and department heads adjacent
to the lounges and study rooms, it is
hoped to build up a spirit of good-
fellowship between faculty and stu-
dents. Under this plan it would no
longer be necessary for students to
make formal weekly appointments
with their supervisors for day by day
contact could be maintained.

Venezuela Dictatorship

Claimed To Be Successfu

There is at least one dictatorship
that has succeeded, according to Dr.
N. A, N_ Cleven, professor of history.
Says Dr. Cleven: “Whether one fav-
ors or does not favor dictatorial rule,
Venezuela, ruled at the present time
_by the dictator Gomez, is in a better
i economic condition than any other one
‘of the 20 Latin-American countries.”

Dr. Cleven will discuss dictator-
ships further in a talk to be given
tomorrow before the International
club of Pittsburgh, entitled: “Some
Dictators of Latin America.” The talk
will be given at the club dinner meet-
;ing in the banquet room of the Pent
‘house at 310' Diamond street.

HE CONCERT SEASON is with

US again: And with it come
the inevitable Byronic collars of our
embryonic child-musicians; the bored
looks of last year's debutantes; the
"Wasn’t it wonderful” of our friends
on the ﬁrst floor; the black ﬂowing
ties and the long hair of our so-called
intellectuals of the second balcony;
and the opportunity once again to rub
elbows with the four hundred—all of
which make the concert season go
’round_ But let us see what is in store
for us.

May Beegle, initiating her twelfth
season of major concerts at Syria
Mosque and at Carnegie Hall, can al-
ways be depended upon. Her own
series of concerts leads oﬁ with the
Metropolitan Opera quartet on Tues-
day, October 30; the vocal group of
which includes the well-known Grace
Moore, soprano; Rose Bampton, mezzo
soprano; Richard Bonelli, baritone;
land Edward Johnson, tenor, all of
whom are celebrated in vocal circles.
Rachmaninoff, who will undoubtedly
ﬁll the Mosque to capacity, follows
with his piano recital on November 9.
The Monte Carlo Ballet Russe will be
here again on November 29, and this
concert will be followed by the Don
Cossacks ‘under their charming lead-
er, Serge Jaroff. on December 18. ‘The
next attraction is |,Lily Pons, the color-
atura ' stella, on February 15. The
outstanding prodigy, Yehudi Menuhin,
heardseveral times before at the Car-
negie Hall, will close the series, The
date is as yet indeﬁnite. '

‘ The Pittsburgh Orchestra associa-
tion se_ries is comprised of four con-
certs.‘ The opening concert will be
given by the Detroit Symphony under
the ‘direction of Ossip Gabrilowitsch
and featuring Viola Mitchel as violin
soloist, on Thursday, November 15.
The second concert will be given by
the Boston Symphony directed by
Serge Koussevitsky on December 14.
Heretofore, the Boston Symphony has
usually appeared twice, This year
la novelty has been introduced. The
:Pittsburgh Symphony orchestra di-
rected by Modarelli will give the third
concert in the series on January 8.
This movement on the part of the
Pittsburgh Orchestra association is,
perhaps, due to therecognition and
,approval the Pittsburgh Symphony
ihas recently enjoyed. The ﬁnale of
the series will be given by the Minne-
apolis orchestra under the direction
of Eugene Ormandy on February 8.

' The third May Beegle series, the
Art Society», includes ‘such notables
as Gladys Swartliout, Frank Chapman,
Vvinifred ‘Christie, Stravinsky, with
Dr'es'kkii1 and the -Glazounoff String
quartet. the ’cel1ist Piatigorsky and
Lotte Lehman, soprano of the Metro-
politan Opera.

N ADDITION the Pittsburgh Sym-

phony will give eight concerts.
The ﬁrst of the series. Wednesday,

October 17, will feature Rosa Pon-
selle, one of the world’s foremost so-
pranos; For later concerts in the ser-
ies Gieseking, Mischa Elman, Jose
Iturbi and Albert Spalding have been
booked.

So you see Pittsburgh will lack no
intellectual features this winter, Yet
it. surprises one to see how few stu-
dents attend the concerts, especially
when the writer knows how liberally
his colleagues will squander ﬁve or
six dollars for a dance at the Chatter-
box and for other enjoyments, in-
finitely shallow when compared with
the pleasure derived from the con-
certs. Just think, for a mere four
dollars one can hear all eight concerts
given by the Pittsburgh Symphony
with the featured artists thrown in!
Yet most of You who have the change
to spare will probably read this col-
umn with insouciance and mob the

The Pitt

Defeats Stubborn Mountaineers
 After Third-Period Threat, 27-6

Sutherland Sees
Team ‘Far From
Smooth’ However

 

Charging Pitt Line, Fast Backs
Dominate Play For Three
Of Four Quarters

 

By James Nelson

MOUNTAINEER FIELD, MORGAN-
TOVVN, W. Va., Oct, 6.—It was one
long afternoon for the Panthers today
at Morgantown. The West Virginians
just refused to admit that they were
licked until the report of the gun at
the end of the game bounced off the
mountain peaks of their native state.

A team like that is hard to beat.
The Panthers lost no time in ﬁnding
that out. They dug in at the start
and really went to work to score the
27 to 6 victory over the “Mighty M.en
of Might.”

The Golden Panthers, wearing white.
jersies, opened up immediately after
the kickoff to score two touchdowns.
Harvey Rocker received a short pass
from Michael Nicksick and ran 54
yards to score the ﬁrst.

Then a long drive headed by Shed-
losky, who "broke 1oos'e’for‘ a 20-yard
gain around right end, placed the ball
on the Mountaineer 20-yard l'lne. Four
plays later Shedlos-ky---went over the
line for Pitt's secondtouchdown after
a six-yard thrust. ' ' i

T Weinstock converted the peint after
the ﬁrst touchdown, and VVeise-nbiaugh
accounted for the second, to give Pitt
3. 14 to 0 advantage at the half. _

In the third quarter the Vfest V11’-
ginia team made a strong comeback
which led‘ to a ‘touchdown, Allen
threw a long pass to Heath, placing
the ball on the Pitt four-yard line.
The Panthers stopped the Mountain-
eers momentarily, but after four line
plays Allen went through left tackle
for the ‘West Virginia touchdown.
The try for the extra point‘ failed,

Late in the fourth period Malarkey
threw a long forward pass to Baxter,
who raced 15 yards for a touchdown.
Weisenbaugh added another extra
point, making the score 27 to 6 in the
Panthers’ favor.

Immediately after the game Dr.
Sutherland stated that the Pitt team
played a greatly improved brand of
football but is still not a smooth-
working machine. He saw plenty of
ﬂaws that will have to be ironed out
before the team lines up against
Southern California at the Stadium
Saturday.

The improved play of Shedlosky
and Detzel was of some satisfaction
to Coach Sutherland. Prior to today
both boys were more or less “question
marks” and could not be counted on
altogether as ﬁrst class players, both
lacking experience in varsity competi-
tion. 4 -

Throughout the game it was evident
that the Pitt team was ready for
everything that the West Virginians

had to offer. The entire team played
heads—up ball for 60 minutes.

Hail to Pitt, hail to Pitt, every loyal

the Middies will hear it; and, if luck
holds out, so will Westminster. The

Saturday morning the band assem-
bled at the Fifth avenue entrance of

blue and gold behind the Panthers
over Mountaineer soil. When the
Panthers have their try at sinking
the Navy, 120 selected blue and gold

for the Middies in their own bowl.
They won’t be home until Sunday.

To show their appreciation for
these trips, the band has started a
campaign to furnish their own trans-
portation to the Westminster game.

Guesswork !

News Gruessers G-et Wise;
Reveal All Predictions
After Each Contest

 

Due to the fact we don't want
to have people counting upon our
prediction as a basis for bets,
and due also to the fact that an
Oakland food shop is offering
real meal tickets for correct pre-
dictions, the Pitt News has hit
upon the happy idea of making
its predictions after the game
rather than before it. ‘

Of course, we take our guess
previous to the time of game on
Saturday, but these guesses are
placed in a sealed envelope and
not opened until after the shout-
ing is all over_ Then we publish
the predictions and you know just
how nice it was that you’ didn't
take our word for anything,

For the Pitt-W&.J game we

said 20-7. Shedlosky crossed 11s
up by contributing an unnecessary
touchdown just to show Jock that
hehas lots of good halfbacks on
the bench, too, 26-6 was the ﬁnal
count, , ‘
 For Pitt and West Virginia we
picked the Panthers to take the
game 14-7. You can see for your-
selvesjust how well that one
made out. ’

‘Seeing Is Believing’
In Thaw Hall
Exhibit

“Now you see it and now you don’t.”
The famous byword of the mystic
magicians holds good for the displays
in the Physics exhibit being staged
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Thaw hall, under
the direction of Dr. E. E. Hutchisson
and Dr. Victor Hicks, professors of
physics,

A phantom lamp, visible from one
angle and invisible from another, is
included in the exhibit, which has
been built to demonstrate the more
important phases of physics, with dis-
plays of optics, sound, and wave mo-
tion.

Two oak cabinets house ‘the exhibi-
tions, which include a cathode ray
oscillascope, the instrument that
makes sound visible, and that gives a
graphic form of the voice. Another
operation makes the "vibration of wires
visible, Also included in the display
are an old fashioned kaleidoscope, a
demonstration of the formation of
images by lenses, and a glass
which you can see yourself as others
see you.

The cabinets have been built by. Dr.
Hutchisson and Dr. Hicks, at a cost
of between $300 and $400, Plans are
being“ made to build a large number
of these machines and-"to place them-‘
in the Cathedral, where they may be
seen by agreater number of students.
James Wallace, PE35, Henry H.
George, PE35, and P. L. Vissat, PE35,
are assisting in this work. '

Pitt Panther

One of the features of the Pitt-
West Virginia game Saturday was
the initial appearance of the new
Panther skin.

The new skin, replacing the old tat-
tered suit of many seasons, can be
easily recognized as a model of what
the well-dressed panther will wear.
The outside covering is made of three
real panther skins, while the tail.
guaranteed as a cannot-be-pulled-off
tail, 11as been constructed of three real
panther tails. The lining of the skin
consists of seven deer skins from
which, although the cost of the skin
hasn’t been made public, it can be
seen that the suit is a “deer-panther”
skin!

Another added feature of the skin
is the four zippers that are intended
to hold it together. There are two

zippers at the shoulders and two that
run along the seams of the legs.

YVhen skinned after the West Vir-
ginia game, the “Panther” was found
to contain Fred Patrick, BA35.

Accessories To The Fore,
Says Fashion Reporter

Individuality Of M ilady Expressed By ‘Thingamabobs’
She Chooses To Wear With Costumes

 

By Sara ‘Harris

Accessories are all-important this
fall, according to the latest edition of
the “Fashion Reporter,” a mimeo-
graphed clothes bulletin published
semi-monthly by the Retail Research
bureau of the University. It might
well be titled “What Every College
Girl Should Know.” for everyone
knows that next to gentlemen, milady
is most interested in clothes.

The “Fashion Reporter” points out
that accessories, aside from trans-
forming a basic dress from one ensem
ble to another, appropriate for varied
occasions, must also express the indi-
viduality of the wearer. Et vice
versa, if man’selle wishes to change
her personality she must select her
accessories to ﬁt her mood. For in-
stance: if a fair co—ed feels a bit lan-
guid after school, she can go medieval
by discarding her gay Robin Hood hat
and oxfords for a tunic and tasseled
silk cord and presto! she’s Queen
Guinevere.

Who would connect repeal with the
clothing business? But the New Deal
works “in divers ways it wonders to
perform," for repeal has created the
“cocktail hour” and women must dress
accordingly. The new specially-de-
signed cocktail shoe is formal enough
for evening wear and yet will be worn
to the more popular restaurants at 5
o’clock. Another essential detail‘ of

Activities Group
To Place Women

Begin To IntervieWApplicants
Today At 12:30 O’clock

 

The day is over, says the VVSGA ac-
tivities committee, when only promi-
nent students with special talents
can go in for activities. This year
the committee wants every woman
student on the campus in some activ-,
ity. Today, tomorrow, and Wednes-‘,
day, from 12:30 to 1.30 o’clock, mem-i
bers of the committee will be in
Heinz House to interview all women
students interested.

The activities committee of WSGA
met Tuesday in Heinz House to dis-
cuss plans for placing women into ac-
tivities. Sally Pinkerton, Ed37, chair-
man, presented a general plan for
placing girls into the activities in
which they are interested.

Women on the committee will in-
vestigate camp-us organizations in
which women take part, Each activ-
ity will be investigated as to the num-
ber of women already in the organiza-
tion and the additional number which
it needs or can use. The committee
is especially interested in sophomore
and transfer women, who are entering
university activities for the ﬁrst time.

Members of the activities commit-
tee of VVSGA are Sally Pinkerton.
Ed35, chairman, Louise Misko, Ed36,
Nancy Arnold, C37, Mary Frances
Brice, Ed36, Jane Little, Ed36, Marie
Bryan, Ed36, Helene Green, C35, Rose
Honig Ed35, and Jean Charters, BA36.

Louis Misko, C36, will be in charge
of the interviews today; Mary Frances
Brice, Ed36, tomorrow; and Sally

Pinkerton. Ed35, Wednesday, They
will tell the students more about the
particular activity she is interested
in, just who to see about getting into
it, and what special requirements
there may be. In general, any woman
who has attained sophomore standing,
has a “-C” average in her studies,
and is carrying at least twelve credits
on the campus is eligible for activi-

_ t.ies.

the cocktail ensemble is matching
fabric gloves of four to eight button
length. Suede bags are still a favor-
ite for afternoon wear, but the fabrics
are gaining in importance.

After the Co-ed Prom last week,
many of the girls now know what the
men had to bear (literally!) back in
the dark ages when evening bags were
small and escorts were checking bu-
reaus for compacts, hankies, and other
odds and ends dear to milady’s heart.
All the new bags are larger, softer,
and designed for greater practicality.
For school or sport, leather, corduroy,
woolen, and knit bags will accommo-
date fountain pen, pencil, comb, com-
pact, keys, and cigarettes as never
before, while for afternoon or even
ing, rich velvet, satin, and brocade
bags will be adorned with jewelled
mountings, and if milady wishes to
sparkle for her lord she has her choice
of sequin, metallic mesh, or cellophane
bags.

Something new in belts is metal
mesh, while rhinestone and sequini
belts vie for evening wear, Suede stilll
leads the ﬁeld of fabric belts for day-
time but for the ladies with a sense of
humor your “Fashion Reporter” rec-
ommends tricky concealed fastenings
that will baffle your friends. Of course,
if you get locked in your belt and
can’t get out, that’s when your sense
of humor is an asset.

Class Teams Vie
For WAA Points

Campaign Sees Competition
Keen Among Divisions

 

Class teams, who are selling mem-
berships in WAA, are staging a three-
sided ﬁght to decide which team will
get the highest number of points.
The expenditure of 25 cents, the
groups say, offers three hours of
hockey a week, three swimming hours,
and two hours each of dancing, arch-
ery, and volleyball. _

The monthly association meetings
are a new feature this year. Some
prominent person in the sports world
will speak at each of these meetings.
Discussions on correct diet and exer-
cise will be presented by Dr. Auleene
M, Jamison as a part of health weeks.

Ruth Anderson is general campaign
manager for the membership drive of
VVAA. Sophomore salesmen are

Multipliers.
of the semester. senior women have
been trying to ﬁnd some one person
who knows what a Chocolate M11ltl-

that it was a candy sale, but that is
not the case at all. Frances McLaugh-
lin, president of the senior class, has
ﬁnally disclosed just what it's all
about

The ﬁrst one of the -Chocolate Mul-
tipliers will take place at Heinz

18 Freshmen Women'Rate
Perfect Customs Scores

Eighteen perfect scores were re-
corded by the freshman women in the
customs examinations given by the
customs committee of WS-GA to in-
coming freshman women. Most of
the grades.were above ninety, the‘
lowest grade was in the low seventies.
Very few of the tests had to be re-
taken before the freshman was given
the right to wear her new blue and
gold armband.

Although members of the customs
committee were in Heinz House at
all times ready to give the test, the
most popular hour was the noon hour.

By Friday noon 204 out of 250 fresh- -

man women had passed their tests.
