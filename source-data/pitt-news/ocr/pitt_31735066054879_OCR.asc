Pitt’s relationship with
the Oakland community has
fluctuatedv with controver-
sies over the former chan-
cellor’s spending and the

closing of Bigelow
Boulevard.

“O’Connor became a
.controversy,” said Ken

Service, Pitt’s spokesperson.
“There was a lot of media
coverage with relation to his
refurbishing of the

University’s residence [for-

the chancellor] and his

office, and with his inaugu-

ration ceremony.”
According to McDuffie,

Volume XCI, Number 64

though these’ actions on the
part of O’Connor were neg-
ative, there is a definite bias
towards the University on
the part of the media. He
also points to bad handling
of public relations issues as
factor which leads to a
image problems for Pitt in
the Oakland community.

Another point of con-
tention _ between the
University and community,
particularly Oakland mer-
chants, came with the trial
closing of Bigelow
Boulevard.

According to Terry

Campasano, daughter of ’

Original Hot Dog‘ Shop
owner Sid Simon, the test

"Blood is compulsory."

closing of Bigelow hurt
their business immensely,
along with their feelings
toward Pitt.

“We lost $9,000 per
week during the test clos-
ing,” said Campasano.
“Oakland is a cultural cen-
ter, and Pitt is trying to buy
it all up.”

In general, Campasano
said that local merchants are
treated poorly by the
University. She cited the
closing of George Aiken’s
restaurant as one example.

“George Aiken was here
longer than us,” said
Campasano. “He was forced
out of business because Pitt

The battle between the dorms is get-
ting ﬁerce as the Lothrop Challenge comes
to an end on Dec. 5. The prize? A chance
to make a child’s last wish come true.

Tower C wants to grant the wish, so
they declared war. The ﬂoors in Tower C
battled‘ amongst themselves in order to
raise money for the Lothrop Challenge.

Each year during the fall semester,
Lothrop Hall challenges the Resident
Students Association of the other residence
halls to a friendly competition beginning
on Halloween night. The halls raise money
for the charity of their choice, and in the
end they all come out winners.

The theme for the Lothrop» Challenge
changes every year. This year the theme is
“Saving our Children.” .

Tower C is in the lead and has already
raised almost $1,100 for the Make-A-Wish
Foundation. Make-A-VV1sh grants wishes
for children stricken with terminal illness-
es. The most popular wish is a trip to
Disney World. Tower C’s most creative
money—raising tactic has been the penny
wars.

On Nov. 11, the wars began. Each
team consisted of three ﬂoors. One resi-

WEATHER  

  

bucket,_ to which the opposing team added
pennies whenever possible. In order to
make another team lose, silver coins (nick-
els, dimes, and quarters) were added to an
opposing bucket to reduce the value of the
pennies. The team with the most pennies
and least amount of silver coins won. The
war lasted 11 days.

On Nov. 21, the coins were counted
and the team of ﬂoors 14, 15, and 16 won
the war. Sabrina Spetz, Tower C’s RSA
treasurer, said that the winning team asked
friends and relatives for donations and then
exchanged the money into pemiies, putting
them at a great advantage. Altogether, the
hall raised $937.09 in less than 11 days.

Tower C also maintains the lead in
other money—raising events in the Lothrop
Challenge. One such ‘event was Taco Bell
delivery night. Menus were made avail-
able to students and a $1 donation was
required for delivery. In addition, $2 was
charged for the Tower C Tailgate party that
was held in the lobby of the building.
Another ﬁmd raiser charged a quarter to
make guesses in the M&M guessing
game. ‘

V\T1th their creative fund-raising ideas,
Tower C may claim the prize of granting a
wish this holiday. I

 

     

The construction crew at
Breachmenders Inc., not only repairs
and rehabilitates old homes in Oakland,
they try to rebuild lives.

Breachmenders, Inc. is a non-proﬁt
community development corporation
located in west Oakland that provides
affordable housing, job placement, and
credit counseling to new home buyers.

With its own construction crew,
currently consisting of three carpenters,
two laborers, and a projects manager,
Breachmenders has successfully reno-
vated more than 50 homes in the area
since the early 19805.

Bob Malnar, the projects manager, .

began working for Breachmenders a lit-
tle more than a month ago and is quick-
ly adjusting to his new position.

“I spend a lot of time in the office
making estimates, doing some 
and designs. I also take 30-50 calls a
day. It’s a lot of paperwork right now,”
said Malnar. ‘

Even though his job proves to be
more than hectic on most days, Malnar
said he enjoys the work. I

“I could be a supervisor, doing
commercial work, making more money.
But I am happy here,” said Malnar.

In addition to renovating old

Breachmenders’ fills
gaps in houses and lives

homes, the crew also works for the
community through Breachmenders’
labor-free program.

Homeowners who are in need of
anything from new windows to a new
fumace beneﬁt from the Labor-free pro-
gram because Breachmenders, who
work with the United Way, can pay up
to 75 percent of the costs of labor.

“I go home in the evening and think
about all of the positive things I have
done,” said Malnar, commenting on the
labor-fre’e program. “For example, pro-
viding running water to an old man and
knowing I helped him out. _That’s
great.”

Other members of the crew ﬁnd
that same satisfaction nearly everyday
on the job.

Salim Howze, a carpenter, came to
Breachmenders as a summer trainee in
1995, and eventually left a woodwork-
ing job to work at Breachmenders full-
time. _

“I look forward going into work in
the morning, and sometimes I don’t
look forward to the end of the day,” said
Howze as he began to repair a wooden
windowsill by wrapping it with alu-
minum.

Howze always had an interest in
carpentry while growing up in
Pittsburgh. He used to build clubhouses

CALCUTTA, India — Mother
Teresa underwent surgery on Sunday
to remove blockages from two arteries
in her heart. Doctors said that she
would have died without the surgery.
“Mother could not have lived had we
not been able to accomplish this,” said
Dr. Patricia Aubernal, who helped
perform the two—hour operation
known as anangioplasty. This is the
third time she underwent angioplasty,
the first two operations taking place in
1991 and 1993. a
Mother Teresa has had a pace-
maker since 1989 and has_ had two
heart attacks since 1983. She has been

‘in the hospital a total of four times

this year alone, twice for injuries sus-
tained during falls and twice with
heart problems. She has been the
leader of the Missionaries of Charity
in India since, 1950. Within the next
few months the; other nuns of this
group will vote on who will become

-their new leader or if Mother Teresa

will continue on. Associated Press

Salvi was serving two consecutive.

MURRAY, Ky. -—. Five teenagers
who called themselves the Vampire
Clan were arrested on Thanksgiving
night for the fatal bludgeoning of the
parents of a Clan member in Eustis,
Fla. on Monday. They had been on the
run for four days until one of the
members decided to call home to ask
for money. Police arrested them as
they checked into a hotel that the par-
ents had reserved for them.

Police said that the daughter of
the murdered couple, 15-year-old
Heather Wendorf, had told friends that
she was a demon in past lives and had
talked with spirits during human

blood—drinking rituals. The Kentucky.

police who found them said that they

were involved in vampire-like activi- —

ties when they were found. “They out
each other’s arms and suck the blood.
They cut up ‘small animals and suck
the blood,” said Murray, Ky., police
Sgt. Mike Jump’. “They honestly

Breachmenders

as a kid and said there is nothing he
would rather do than carpentry.

Since Howze began at
Breachmenders, he has worked to fully
renovate three homes in west Oakland.

“These new homes are like ﬂowers.
First a ﬂower is a bud, then it sprouts into
something beautiful. This neighborhood
is a beautiful garden of homes,” Howze
said.

Bringing people out of public hous-
ing into their own homes is one of the
things that makes the crew’s job so
rewarding.

“From going to an apartment to your
own house. It is something to be proud
of,” said Howze.

Certain homeowners living in these
renovated homes were able to witness
first hand the work that was being per-
formed on their homes. In some
instances, they took part in the work.
Many have decided on such things as a
built in china cabinet to a laundiy shoot.

Howze ﬁnds his job rewarding when
he drives past one of the homes he has
worked on and says to himself, “I did
that!”

John Struthers, another carpenter,
began working at Breachmenders over a
year ago. He found out about the job
through a friend at his church.

During his stay, Struthers has worked
to fully renovate ﬁve homes in west
Oakland, and has worked on numerous
labor-free projects.

THE PITT NEWS » 3

 

“Breachmenders is very much a
respected organization. They have satis-
ﬁed a lot of people and they have a good
reputation,” Struthers said.

Being able to help people repair their
homes at an affordable price is one of the
aspects of Struthers’ job that makes it
rewarding.

“It’s a great feeling knowing that you
helped somebody who wouldn’t normal-
ly be able to afford a regular contractor,”
said Struthers.

Curtis Mitchell, the foreman, said he
heard about the construction crew
through Howze and began working in
May.

“It is good work, and I am very glad
to be here. I like what Breachmenders
stands for, and the way they help out so
many people,” said Mitchell.

The quality of the craftsmanship
increases, according to Mitchell, because
of the fact that so many community

members beneﬁt from the services that A

Breachmenders offer.

“I tend to step up the quality of the
work I do on these houses just because I
am so enthused to help people,” said
Mitchell. “We all strive to do better.”

Bob Malnar said that he is looking
for more people to join the construction
crew. .

“We all see Breachmenders expand-
ing, and growing into a larger organiza-
tion,” Malnar said. “Things will only get
better.”

wanted his property.”
Not all merchants share
Campasano’s feelings, however. Chris
Monti, owner of the Touch of Gold
jewelry store, had some complaints
about the University’s treatment of
local businesses, but was generally
positive about Pitt.
“They’ve tried
real hard in the past
couple years to
build a better rela-
tionship with the
Oakland mer-
chants,” said Monti.
“They’re more sen-
sitive to our needs.”

Monti noted
dealings with
University officials
such as Keith
McDuffie and
Public Safety

Director Rick Boyd were very posi-
tive. He said that issues, which were
discussed with these representatives,
among others, were followed up,
though he admits that they weren’t
always pursued to the extent the mer-
chants wanted.

Monti also mentioned a golf out-

I ing sponsored by the University and
 local merchants which raised $28,000

 

 

' mom PAGE I

for Kevin Cecil as proof that Pitt and
Oakland’s merchants can work togeth-
er positively.

On the negative side, Monti said
dealings he and other merchants had
with Pitt administrator John DeVito
went badly because he was not
responsive to their
needs.

“I had a half-
hour meeting with
him to discuss
three points we
wanted him to fol-
low up for us,” said
Monti. “He said he
was going to fol-
low them up for us,
and we never heard
from him again.”

Pitt’s public
image is an entity
which will obvi-
ously change with time, but as Service
said, it isn’t as bad as some think right
now.

“In general, Pitt and the communi-
ty have an appreciation for the value
each holds for the other,” said Service.
“The University is making a real
effort, and is committed to being a
good neighbor. The community real-
izes the University is a plus.”

The Pitt News recommends
(I new football coach, folks

‘With the resignation of Head Coach Johnny Majors and the
recent follies of the Pitt football program, we believe that not only is
it necessary that Athletic Director Steve Pederson hire the right man,
but also that he must do it quickly.

And we believe that the right man is Matt Cavanaugh. Not only
was Cavanaugh MVP of the 1977 Sugar Bowl, the game which

, solidiﬁed Pitt’s 1976 National Championship, he’s currently the

quarterback coach for the San Francisco 49ers. He deals with Steve
Young and Elvis Grbac on a day-to-day basis.

Although Cavanaugh’s name doesn’t command the attention of
a Mike Ditka, who hasn’t coached since 1992, or a Tony Dorsett,
who’s never coached anything, it’s pretty easy to see that he’s a capa-
ble, hard—working man who has some serious connections to this
school.

Over the last few weeks, names like Joe Walton of Robert
Morris College, JlII1 Tressel of Youngstown State; and good ol’
Jackie Sherrill, whose 1980-81 Pitt team is considered one of the
greatest ever, have surfaced as potential candidates.

God help us. v ‘

Walton couldn’t teach Bubby Brister how to throw a spiral dur-
ing his reign as Steeler offensive coordinator, and you saw the job he
did with some fairly talented New York Jets teams in the early ‘80s.
How could he turn around this program? Tressel did a marvelous job
at Youngstown State, but he doesn’t have the name power to recap-
ture the Westem Pennsylvanian recruits that we now lose to Penn
State and Ohio State. Sherrill owns Pitt’s best all-time winning per-
centage, but his heart isn’t at Pitt.

Cavanaugh’s heart is here. Earlier in the year, The Pitt News
contacted Cavanaugh after his name surfaced as a candidate for the
Athletic Director’s position. He denied it and told us, “I’m just a

coach.” The goal of any coach is to be a head coach, a position of '

incredible esteem when a team wins or a position of public scorn
when a team loses. it

With the legwork that Majors accomplished in his second
tenure here‘ (stadium renovations and improved recruiting),
Cavanaugh has the potential to continue leading this program back
to glory, or at least a winning season.

I feel the need, the need for accuracy

 

Ftﬁhandlast—PIZ?—-ina
series on Campaign ‘96.

(Now I know you may be sick
and tired ofmy ruminations on the
recently concluded political cam-
paign —-— or, more likely, you may be
just sick and tired of politics. Please
bear with me, as I have to write this
for a class. I'll get back into my
“campus sage” mode with the next
column.)

Forty-eight years ago, the early
edition of the Chicago Tribune pub-
lished ’_ this headline: DEWEY
DEFEATS TRUMAN.

Uh —— not quite.

I don’t know if that was the ﬁrst
tirneamediasourcedeclaredarace
over before enough votes had come
in, but it certainly hasn’t been the last.

And unfortunately, we saw a
few broadcasters make that same
mistake this election season, when
they tried to project the winners of
certain  Prematurely, as it
turned out in some cases.

That brings up an important
question for those of us in the mass
media; Which should take a higher
priority -—— accuracy or speed? Do
we make sure we get thestory right
but not quite at the time you may
want or need it, or do we just report
immediately what we have at the
time and risk making idiots of our-
selves?

It happens every four years, as
western states have long complained
about projections of presidential
races before the polls have even
closed. I can’t blame them —— who
wants to vote in a race you know has
already been decided? In fact, the
earliest projection I ever heard was
four years ago on local radio station

-WYJZ, -when Bill Clinton was-

deemed the winner of the presiden-
tial race —— before I left work for the
day! s ’
Anyway, on Election Night, I
went with the rest of my Campaign
‘96 class and our fearless leader(?)
Bill Moushey of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette to sample sever*al‘of the local
post-election parties. While at GOP
attomey general candidate Mike
Fisher’s event, folks watching CBS
heard Dan Rather say that Bob Dole

conceded the presidential race at

9:05 ——- which, as we would learn
later, wasn’t quite right. (Some con-
servatives would consider that wish-
ful thinking on Rather’s part, as they
have long held him up as a poster
boy for the so-called “liberal bias” of
the mainstream media)

Making projections based on

A incomplete data can make you look

downright silly, and here’s where it
helps, to understand trends. In
Pennsylvania, for example,
statewide races often show a
Democratic candidate with a big
early lead and the Republican oppo-
nent closing fast or overtaking at the
end.

Why? Because the heavily
Democratic big cities usually have
electronic voting booths, which
make for faster counting. On the
other hand, you will likely still use
paper ballots, which take just a little
longer, if you live in the GOP—dorni-
nated center of the state. I remem-
bered that two years ago, when at
around 9:30 p.m. the media correctly
projected Rick Santorum the winner
over Hanis Wotford for the U.S.
Senate, even though Wofford was
actually ahead in the actual vote
count at the time.

However, some folks apparent-
ly forgot.

That happened in the races for

attomey general and state treasurer,

when the Associated Press declared
Joe Kohn and Mina Baker Knoll, the
respective Democratic candidates,
the victors at around 11:30 pm. In
fact, at Knoll’s party, the campaign
had even posted vote totals on a
screen to the rightof the podium
which gave her about 54 percent.

But by the time Moushey got
me home at around 1 am.
Wednesday, both races turned into a
deadheat—and Fisher and Barbara
Hafer would eventually end up in the
winner’s circle.

And arguably the most embar-
rassing — and hilarious — gaffe
pulled by the media had to come
from KDKA-TV, which at 9:30 p.m.
had projected Mike McCormick the
winner over Frank Mascara in a local

congressional race. However, just’

five minutes later, anchor Stacy
Smith, mumbling that “I need to
wipe the egg off my face,” admitted
that the totals he read only represent-
ed the Allegheny County portion of
that district, which extends into

Washington and Greene counties.-

(Mascara won, by the way.)

Solutions? Run either regular
programming or the results of state
or local races starting at, say, 9
o’clock and defer the presidential
race until the 10 or 11 o’clock news
(depending on the time zone). Or
perhaps the news bureaus could
report out of Los Angeles or San
Francisco where the polls don’t close
until late. Okay, I know that folks on
the East Coast, depending on what
time they go to bed, might not get the
results until they wake up the next
morning. But hey —— we do want to
get the story right, don’t we?

It would help to remember the
old Yogi Berra—ism “It ain’t over ‘til
it’s over.”

wistful

 

Like every other semester, the time
spent in this wonderful place we call
Oakland has ﬂown by so quickly.
Unfortunately, the endof my last term has
come. Graduation for this sports writer is
right around the corner.-

Reality — or “life after graduation”
— will be opening up a big can of whoop-
ass on me in two weeks, so before I go
down for the count, it’s time to send out
my thank yous for the 1996 holiday sea-
son.

First up, The Pitt News’ Sports
Editor Mike Kovak: You are simply one
of the funniest guys I’ve ever met. Thanks
for letting me express my positive and all-
powerful Philadelphia views (well, you
didn’t, really) on the student population,
as well as prime coverage of the ‘96 Pitt
volleyball squad. It won’t be the same rib-
bing you every time Philly wi‘ns and
Pittsburgh loses when I’m 300 miles

. away. But I’ll still do it, and it’ll still be

fun.

A big shout out goes out to Cindy
Alvear, Jeff Belmonte, and the ‘96 Pitt
Volleyball squad. You guys and gals were
always gracious enough to talk after
matches, win or lose, and any other time I
bugged all of you. Congratulations on
another successful season, and best wish-
es in the future.

Harry Ennis, Bob Guydosh, Larry

Eldridge, and the rest of Pitt sports infor- ‘

mation: I’ve never known two guys that
work as hard as Harry and Bob in getting
me stats on volleyball, wrestling or any-
thing we need down here at the paper.
Your efforts are greatly‘ appreciated.
Larry, thanks for all the help and opportu-
nities you’ve given me in my years here.
Matt Grove, assistant and soon-to—be
sports editor at The Pitt News.: Aside
from all the ribbing and practical jokes we
play on each other, it’s been great work-
ing with you. I only wished you were
actually good at pulling off funny practi-
cal jokes. —

Gropplers gobble
opponents for
Thanksgiving dinner

While most of us were
at home enjoying our
Thanksgiving break, the
wrestling team feasted their
own way by kicking off the
seasonin dynamic fashion.

The first helping came
by way of a 28-6 slaughter-
ing of Bloomsburg on
Tuesday night. The
Panthers went back for sec-
onds and followed the win
up with an impressive
fourth‘-place finish at the

Mat Town Invitational held I

at Lock ‘Haven on Friday
and Saturday.

“I was very pleased. We
did a nice job,” Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer said _of
the Bloomsburg match.
“We had fun, and we tried
to make it a fun event for
the fans, too.”

The Panthers drew
1,024 fans, a nice crowd,
especially considering the

meet was the night before
Thanksgiving break.

“The crowd was in the
match, and our guys really
fed off of that. It really
helped us a lot,”
Stottlemyer said.

Redshirt junior Chris

Stevens jump—started the
evening with a 7-2 victory
over Bloomsburg’s Jason
Hiltabidel at the 118-pound.
weight class.

The Panthers dropped

the next two matches, with '

freshman Rob Loper losing
8-4 in his first collegiate
dual meet at 126 pounds
and redshirt sophomore
Chad Jesko losing 6-3 at the
134-pound weight class.

“I felt a little intimidat-
ed with it being my first
match and all,” Loper said.
“He’s [Brett 'I‘ullo] a pretty
tough kid. He out-wrestled
me, but I’ll probably run
into him again and hopeful-
ly things will turn out dif-
ferently then.”

Tuesday, December 3, ‘I996

Chris -Stevens bends in all kinds of crazy ways for the
Panthers at the H8 pound weight class.

That was it for
Bloomsburg —— they didn’t
win another match the rest
of the night.

Mike Dixon’s 3-2 vic-
tory at 142 put Pitt right
back in the match after the
two losses.

The momentum carried
over to the next match,
where junior Larry
Sprecher dominated Brad
Gilbert of Bloomsburg in
their clash at the 150-pound
weight class. Sprecher took
his opponent down six
times en route to his 14-5

major decision (victory by
eight or more points).

“The last takedown was
real important,” explained
Sprecher. “It gave me an
eight-point lead, which
meant an extra team point.”

The Panthers continued
to roll with a 5-4 victory by
Jacob Schaus at 158 and an
impressive 17-6 major deci-
sion by 167-pounder John
Withrow.

Perhaps the best indi-
vidual effort of the night

giving him a technical fall (five team

Mark Bodo and Rick Vettorel ﬁn-

the 190-pound and heavyweight class-

“It’s a lot more intense here,” said
Vettorel, who just transferred to Pitt

Pitt finished fourth and collected
