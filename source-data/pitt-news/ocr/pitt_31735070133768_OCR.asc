VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 115

A RAN/PHOT0 EDITOR
Freshman Justin Chalker, a CAS student, samples ribs and
okra yesterday in‘ C-Side. The event, part of Sodexho’s

celebration of Black History Month, included performances,
historical lessons and African, black and Caribbean cuisine.

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

Cultural understanding came in the fonn of
Jamaican jerk fish, collard greens laced with

‘chunks of meat and spiced okra salad last night.

For the price of one meal block —— $4.85 ——
Sodexho treated diners at the Marketplace on C-
Side to African drumming, step dancing and tradi-
tional African, black and Caribbean cuisine. As
part of its armual celebration of Black History

Month, Sodexho teamed up with the Black Action V

Society and a committee of students from other
campus organizations to create Tuesday night’s
event.

Abdou Cole, Sodexho’s food services director,
said that his company wanted to promote, “cultur-
al understanding between students.”

He added that this event was done in conjunc-
tion with a Caribbean-themed night at the
Sutherland dining hall, which featured the reggae
group The Flow Band. But, Cole said, “Towers is

‘ alwaysthe main event.”

Staff, students 'and’*~guests from» Weil
Technological Institute, a Pittsburgh school,
helped themselves from tables heaped with food.
Many returned. for seconds and thirds, openly
praising the menu change.

Ashley Pierson, a freshman, said she appreci-
ated the change. “In comparison to what it was
before, it’s good,”.she said, taking a bite of the
lentil salad on her plate.‘ Despite her approval of

ookin’ fr sul food, and a place to eat

the different food, Pierson said that the “gummy”
okra had been affected by what she termed the “C-
Side wand of blandness.”

Honoring the evening’s theme, “Our legacy is
strong: Black history is part of American History,”
biographies of black leaders hung on the walls and
cultural events livened the afternoon.

' Ryan Lacey, the staff supervisor for the
Marketplace, even arranged one of the groups of
tables in an X, in honor of black leader Malcolm
X. “I think that‘ Martin Luther King, Jr., and
Malcolm X are the two most inﬂuential leaders,”
Lacey said.

As attendees gorged on the spiced ﬁsh and
greens, the Imhotep drummingensemble beat out
rhythms, following a performance by Anointed
Steps of Faith, a step dance troupe. Other groups
also performed for both students and the
Marketplace staff who gathered at the entrance.

For instance, the Mind Boxing Alliance sang,
recited poetry and spit A out rhymes. Jahsee
McDaniel, a former Pitt student who will be
returning next semester and a member of the Mind
Boxing Alliance, said of the group’s content that,
“I guess it will be centered around diversity.
Everyone will be getting a taste.”

But not everyone was pleased with the new
tastes presented. Valerie Jordan, a "freshman at
Point Park College visiting Pitt, said of herself and
her friend that, “We’re vegetarians and we try to
eat low-fat  there was absolutely nothing for

Former Secretary of State Baker talks with honors students

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
Staff Writer

.Smiling with one of those wrin-
kled and twinkling grandfather—fami1-
iar smiles, former Secretary of State

James Baker chewed on the ice from"

his glass of water and told stories
about presidential integrity, the fall of

the Soviet Union and his four-year-old“
grandson meeting with former

President Gerald Ford.

Baker, who was in town as a
speaker for Pitt’s Ambassadors
Scholarship Dinner, took time out for
an informal question-and-answer ses-
sion with a few Pitt Honors College
students yesterday afternoon.

Sitting up straight in his chair and
gesturing with wide arms, Baker
talked with a Texas drawl about the
integrity and character he saw in the
three presidents he worked under.
Hunching over and putting his chin on

his hand in -an impersonation of
Reagan, he described a time when
Reagan realized he needed to raise
taxes. .

“He just got mad as hell: ‘Raise
taxes? I just can’t do that and betray
all those people,’ then he threw his
glasses down on the desk. ‘I had never
seen him so angry.”

During the Reagan
Administration, Baker was the
S_ecretary of the Treasury, Chief of
Staff, and the president’s Economic
Policy counsel. -

Reagan, along with Ford and
Bush, were men of integrity, Baker
said. Warning that he didn’t want to
have a partisan discussion before delv-
ing into the next thought, he talked
about what characteristics he respect-
ed in good leaders.

“It’s very easy to find a scapegoat,

"but the presidents I worked for were

very loath to do so. Loyalty up and

loyalty down is really important.”

Baker was weary of getting into
partisan politics, perhaps because he
was not always a red-tie-donning-
Republican.

After his wife died of breast can-
cer he was approached by a close
friend who told him he needed to do
something to «occupy his time. This
close friend was former president
George Bush, and he was offering
Baker a position. In response to
Bush’s invitation, Baker explained he
was a Democrat.

Bush was obviously convincing,
because Baker accepted the position,
and went on to serve during three dif-
ferent presidencies —— Ford, Reagan
and Bush — as well as a United-
Nations-appointed mediator over the

_ Western Sahara Dispute in 1997.

In reﬂecting upon his work with
international figures, Baker talked
about the fall of the Berlin Wall that

: led to the almost immediate demise of

the Soviet Union. He explained he was
hosting a lunch for the Philippines’
president when he received a note
telling that East Berlin was to permit
transit to the West. Hours later the
wall came down.

“When the Berlin Wall fellit came

as sort of a surprise to everybody that ‘

it came so quickly. We wanted to con-
tinue to work with [the Soviets] to
make sure the Cold War ended peace-
fully.” ..

Before the discussion ended,
Baker told a story about when his
grandson was four years old. In a visit
to President F ord’s campaign office
with his dad, the boy stared from the
ceiling to the ﬂoor marveling at the
size of the room. As his father said
goodbye, Baker’s_ grandson looked up
at Ford and said, “President Ford, you
oughta see my dad’s office: it’s really
tiny.” .

Students, facy ﬁnd child care crun

KATE GIAMMARISE
Staff Writer

There’s a saying that every mother is a
working mother. If that’s ﬂue case, Pitt-grad
student Julie Shepard is deﬁnitely working
overtime.

In addition to being a student, Shepard
also works full time for the Alumni
Association and is a single mom.

“I wouldn’t trade being a parent for
anything in the world, but it’s a very difficult
job,” she said.

“I do my day job and go home to my
second full-time job as a parent. When that’s
done I get to sit down and study. It can easi-
ly be 10 o’clock at night before I crack a
book.” '

Shepard isn’t alone. Many Pitt students,
both undergrad and graduate, are parents.

According to Sherry Cleary, the direc-
tor of the University Child Development
Center, Pitt offers childcare services to stu-
dents who have children, as well as mem-
bers of Pitt’s faculty and staff.

Currently, about 50 student-parents uti-
lize the UCDC, and between 25 and 50
are‘ ‘actively waiting” to enroll their children.

Cleary said the UCDC allows student-
parents to schedule their childcare needs
according to their class schedule, which
keeps costs as low as possible and allows
them a maximum amount of time with their
children. According to Cleary, this is rela-
tively rare among campus childcare pro-

grams, and is possible at Pitt because the

university is so ﬁnancially
supportive of the center.

need. Cleary said that for students, this isn’t
hard to do. She also said that Pitt is unique in
this respect.

In addition to her role in overseeing
childcare at Pitt, Cleary is also the president-
elect of the National Coalition for Campus
Children’s Centers, a group that works with
childcare programs on many different cam-
puses. .

“We want student—parents to succeed in
school,” Cleary said. '

The organization tries to facilitate dis-'

cussion between dilferent on-carnpus child-
care groups to allow them to share ideas and
strategies. Cleary said she pointed to Pitt’s
willingness to allow part-time enrollment as

one innovative program that

she brought to the group.

Cleary also said that - . “We try and share how we do

students can try to schedule

their classes then. She said that less than
one-third of the children on the waiting list
are from students, and that most of that third
are the children of graduate students, not
undergrads.

There’s no set time as to how long a
person might have to wait for childcare, she
said, because it depends on different factors,
such as the age of the child and the times
needed. “It’s not an exact science.”

Paying the bills .

The cost of childcare at the UCDC
varies according to family income, the
child’s age, and if the care needed is part-
t:ime or full-time. Additionally, once student-
parents have their children in the program,
they can have up to half of the cost subsi-
dized by Pitt if they demonstrate ﬁnancial

any money from CCAMPIS,
the program is helpful to other childcare.
centers that aren’t as well-funded through
their schools.
Most people who are in need of child-
care at Pitt are referred to UCDC.
Stephanie Hoogendoom, one of the
vice presidents of the Graduate and
Professional Student Association, and the
graduate representative to the Provost’s
Advisory Committee on Women’s
Concems, said GPSA tries to spread the
word about university childcare among
graduate students. “It’s so much more than
just babysitting,” she said.

Waiting your turn

The main complaint about the universi-
ty’s childcare center, at least -from faculty
and staff, seems to be the long waiting list

it isn’t cheap,” Stabile said.

. Sara Brennan, an advisor in the College
of General Studies, has a son who-is nearly
two years old. He has been on the UCDC
waiting list since October 1999.

“I have to use a babysitter now . . . it just
really seems like we don’t have University
childcare,” Brennan said. A

Carol Stabile, the director of Pitt’s
Women’s Studies program, also had her son
on the waiting list for approximately a year
and a half.

“The University’s childcare center is
wonderful. But the wait list is so long. And

Stabile said that obtaining child care is
imperative, putting the situation in‘ the con-
text of broader national issues. “The dilfer-
ence that quality childcare makes in work-
ing women’s lives is amazing,” she said.

there are other childcare options.

Camille Locke, the supervisor of
resource and referral at Child Care
Information Services of Allegheny County,
said her organization tries to be a “one stop
shop” to help people locate ‘affordable child-
care.

CCIS maintains a database of licensed
and registered childcare providers from the
Pennsylvania Department of Public
Welfare. They can also help pay’ for child-
care if the parents meet certain work, and
income requirements, using money from
the Pemisylvania Department of Public
Welfare. ‘ '

Locke said, “We do get quite a few calls
from students in the Oakland area.” She
encouraged anyone in need of childcare to
call CCIS'at (800) 392-3131. ,

One popular program available to‘stu-
dent-parents is Mom’s House. Mom’s
House is a non-proﬁt organization that pro-
vides free comprﬂtensive services to single
parents who are full-time students.

According to assistant director Jennifer
Milcarek, Mom’s House has three locations
throughout Allegheny County, but the one
most popular with Pitt students is located in
Swissvale. '

viding Mom’s House with copies of their
transcript. Tutoring services are also avail-
able to those who are struggling academi-
Cally.

Additionally, all parents must attend
weekly parenting sessions. According to
Milcarek, this “allows parents to be support-
ive of each other. We’re working with them
as a family.”

It takes a village

Pitt history major and mother Ellen
Boyd is currently trying to start a support
group for single moms on Pitt’s campus.

“Being a single mom is really hard 
It has been a real struggle. I have this vision
for a group where we can all come together
and help each other to achieve our goals,”

she said.

Boyd, 27, said she wishes a support

group would have been ir1 place when she

ﬁrst came back to school a few years ago.
Stabile agreed, saying that the cause is a
good one. . ' .

' “I think what [Boyd] is trying to do is
really important,” Stabile said. “When you
think about the people who work and work
and get so little credit for what they do, it’s
single moms. I have so much admiration for
them.” ‘

Pitt fans must step up the craziness

Life is full of paradoxes. For
instance, how is it that the city of
Pittsburgh can be populated by
some of the country’s most dedicat-
ed and loyal sports fans, but the
University of Pittsburgh has just
enough to count on ten fingers and a
few toes?

It’s confusing, and though it
may be difficult to determine where
the answer is, this year’s Pitt sports
teams have definitely shown us
where the answer is not — in their
performance.

While many of Pitt’s teams have
strutted their stuff this year, the bas-
ketball team has obviously captured

most of the limelight. Its amazing

season caught everyone off guard,
and this Saturday marks the last
game at Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt will host the West Virginia
Mountaineers in a game that is cer-
tain to be a delicious appetizer
before next week’s Big East
Tournament. The tournament will be
held at New York City’s Madison
Square Garden Wednesday through
Saturday, and tickets" are still avail-
able through Ticketmaster.

Like many other basketball.

games this season, the West Virginia
game is sold out. _Pitt’s few di.ehard
fans have joined forces with the vast
throng of fair weather supporters to

make sure the house is packed nice
and tight for each contest. For those
of you who planned ahead and
secured your tickets, don’t even

enter the building until you’ve pre-

pared yourself to get rowdy.

If you missed out on the tickets,
don’t get discouraged. You can still
tailgate and have the time of your
life. If that doesn’t suit you, just
grab some friends and gather around
the television to supportjthe team
from the comfort and privacy of
your own home.

Pitt basketball is ranked the 10th
best team in the nation. This year’s
team is something special, and it
warrants a little noise from Pitt stu-
dents, faculty and viewers like you.

Though it is highly esteemed for
many of ‘its admirable aspects, Pitt
is not known as a sports school.
Universities like Notre Dame, Duke,
North Carolina and even Penn State
are defined by their sports for two
reasons: the players step up and the
fans rally to support them.

If ever Pitt had the opportunity
to develop and promote its athletic
programs, this is it. Our players
have stepped up, and it is now our
responsibility to do the rest.

In this category, the fate of the
school now lies in the hands of the
fans. '

    Hands-on experience

  The story of a memorable first kiss

Judith. I’ll never forget that
name, and zounds, it’s been a while.
As I remember her, she

were remarkably sucky. First, I just
stared at her a lot. Later, my “so, I
- hear your dad’s a thief”

was" about 5 feet 4 inches,
with dirty blonde hair and
a wry, saucy smile that ‘
sent my heart palpitating
at 60 miles per horny.
Judith — my first kiss.

line didn_’t work too well
either. It was probably
because I never learned
, the rest of it. Worst of all,
I kept saying the same
damn stuff to her over
and over again until she
finally started ignoring
me. I was cr-apping it up
big time. So I ‘threw in
the towel and went to eat

 

into just another one of

his youth group’s weekend conven-
tions —‘ or so he thinks. His eyes
immediately shoot across the room
at the finest specimen of woman he’s
ever seen. Those deep blue eyes, that
sprightly laugh, those magnificent,
still developing breast buds. He
gulps, all Kevin Arnold-like, as he is
instantly pummeled with ravenous
whirlwinds of infatuation.

. This wasn’t really my first
instacrush. Those happened all the
timei my next door neighbor, Mrs.
Green — the humpbacked geezer of
a third grade teacher —— plants, you
name it. Still, this time was different.
This time, goddamnitall, I was going
to raise my .000 batting average and
do something about it. Lo, my pick-
up skills were rather primitive —
something like trying to write out the

correct answer one chemistry test by‘

beating it with a wooden club — but
at least I had the heart to either do it
up good or crash and burn miserably.

My initial attempts to woo Judith

a Ben and J erry’s Chunky
Monkey pint of dismay. .

It wasn’t until Saturday night, as
the convention wound down, that
anything else happened. In the large
recreational room, most of the con-
ventioneers, about 40 youthful Jews,
huddled around the TV on mattress-
es and sleeping bags for movie night.
Out of the_corner .of my eye I saw
Judith sitting in the back by herself.
My troops were all but defeated, lay-
ing there, bleeding helplessly on the

battlefield of my lost campaign. So_

what the hell did I have to lose? I

canned the Casanova and started a .

conversation with her. Quite a con-
cept. We ended up talking for a cou-
ple hours. -

It was only after all this time that
we wandered into a separate room
and I said, “You wanna go?” while
motioning my head toward the
movie room. Somehow, she thought
I meant, “Let’s get it on already” and

Thefree press and Daniel Pearl(l963-2002)

In January 2002, terrorists again
attacked America. The attack came
to its gruesome and tragic comple-
tion on February 21 when Daniel
Pearl, a foreign correspon-

tions that are the foundations of sup-
port for terrorist organizations and
the repressive fundamentalist soci-
eties that give rise to such groups.

In recent months,

dent for the Wall Street-
Journal, was murdered by
members of Jaish-e-
Muhammad, a group of
radical Pakistani national-
ists that had kidnapped
him a month before.

The reason (if such a

 

newspapers have been
filled with articles about
the Muslim world’s
refusal: to believe that
the Sept. 11 attacks were
committed by Muslims
and in the name of
Islam. Rather, conspira-

word can be applied to
such senseless circum-
stances) given by the ter-

M. Derek Care

Columnist

cy theories have been
created alleging that the
attacks were part of an

rorists was that. Pearl was

Jewish, and was therefore an enemy
of Islam. Though this is at best a
sloppy excuse, lacking even the
rudimentary logic that belies Osama
bin Laden’s rhetoric, the terrorists
were absolutely correct in labeling
him an enemy to both their cause
and their conception of Islam.

Pearl was an agent of the free
press, an enemy to terrorists in some
way more dangerous than a hostile
army, which can create martyrs,
sympathizers and even future terror-
ists. Rather, by working for the free
flow of honest information, the
press erodes the lies and misconcep-

elaborate conspiracy

perpetrated by the CIA and Israeli-'

intelligence with the goal of justify-
ing an attack on Islam.

Rumors about hundreds of Jews
who worked in the World Trade
Center and had known not to come
to work on Sept. 11 are accepted as
fact, and without the benefit of an-
honest source of information,
Muslim societieshave no reason to
disbelieve ‘ such unsubstantiated
claims.

The lies become truth, truth
turns to madness, and the ranting of
a terrorist or mullah blaming the
woes of Muslim societies on far-

fetched American—Israeli conspira-

cies suddenly become understand-_

able, perhaps even logical. And as
history has shown countless times, a
culture of anger and scapegoating
cannot thrive or even maintain, but
rather is doomed to collapse under
the weight of its own false concep-
tions.

Maybe Pearl’s killers murdered
him because they recognized the
dangers that a journalist represents
to a society built on misinformation.
Maybe they murdered him because
they considered the best defense
against the threat of truth to be a fit
of brutal insanity. Maybe they mur-
dered him simply because he was an
easy and defenseless target.

Whatever the reasons, Pearl’s
murder is an attack on America just
as surely as were the events of Sept.
11. The World Trade Center and the
Pentagon symbolized America’s
financial, military and governmental
might. As a reporter, Pearl symbol-
ized the free flow of information
that underlies those and every other
properly working American institu-
tion.

When an institution or group
becomes hidden from the scrutiny of
the public eye, as did the CIA in the

’50s and. Enron in the ’90s, it
becomes exempt from the oversight

that guards against greed, scandal 0

and corruption.

This _ is why the General
Accounting Office is suing Dick
Cheney for disclosure of the details
of his Energy'Task Force. This is
why the Pentagon is already retract-
ing their plans of creating a propa-
ganda and misinformation generat-
ing unit called the “Office of
Strategic Influence.”.

The free press is what made our
country great, and our greatness will
last only as long as does our free
press- Reporters and journalists
know this,- but it sometimes takes a
tragedy to remind the rest of the
world.

As for Pearl, one can on-ly take
comfort in the fact that he is now in
a place far beyond the reach of ter-
rorists and their violence, surround-
ed by firefighters, policemen’ and
soldiers, listening to their words and

. recording the truth one story at a

t1II'lC.

M. Derek Care regrets that so many
heroes are recognized only because
of their deaths. He can be reached
at derekcare@yahoo.com.

Bad scenery fails to kill the mood

Rubin, page 6

said, “Make out? Okay, where should we go?”
Huh? How’d that happen? At this point I was
reeling with giddy anticipation, so in my
drunken excitement I pointed to the most
romantic place I could think of: the boys lock-
er room. Bravo, Mr. Rubin, bravo.

We scurried clandestinely to my urinal-
laden Shangri-La, and then sat down on a
bench in the changing room. Here goes noth-
ing — she could tell it was my first time, as
Abe Simpson would say, I kissed her like a
mule eating an apple. I licked her lips, teeth,
cheeks and uvula in some skill-less, face-eat-
ing frenzy. Unfortunately, I never improved
since then. She moved away and said, “Here,
let meshow you.” That time I think I just start-
ed vacuuming her chin. OK, so I was a little
nervous. We warmed the cold tiled floor with
our hot passion. Before I knew it, my glasses
had fogged up so much that they caught on
fire. Ah, l’amore. “Smooching” continued this
way for a few more minutes until  what was
that noise?

Being Chivalrous Ben, I went to investi-
gate at the door. What I found was the entire
convention body partying outside the locker
room waiting for me to. emerge. And when I
did, they erupted in cheers and song and dance.
Confetti and balloons fell from the ceiling and
someone spritzed champagne all over me.

“Mazel tov, you dawg!” “I’ve got shpilkas in

my ganectikazoink!_” “Ya crazy shmendrick —
Good Shabbas!” Following my older brother
Gabe’s lead, a bunch of guys hoisted me up on
their shoulders while chanting a booming,
rousing chorus of “BEN! BEN! BEN!”

Perched up on my peers’ shoulders, my
first thought was, “So, I really am the greatest
thing that ever existed? I had a feeling it was
true.” —— which was followed by, “Gadzooks, I
finally lost my virginity.” Too bad my next
thought was, “Is that Judith, crying?”

Yes, caught up in our manly bondfest, we
boys forgot about the other 50 percent of the
population — the people who aren’t so hot on
Fox’s “When Animals Attack the World’s
Worst Train Wrecks,” inspiring acts of public
ﬂatulence, and mostof all, insensitive hooli-
ganism that -.noarrasses and hurts others (i.e.,
bringing a beer bong to a funeral).

Judith and I ended up talking things over,
and she felt much better after I blamed every-
thing on my friends and she made fun of me
for being the worst kisser ever.

So I guess everything ended up just
peachy.

Well, Judith, wherever you are, if you’re
listening, you dropped your red scrunchie and

I still have it for safekeeping. So if you need it

back, e-mail me or something.

Fans must go crazy for the final I
game at Fitzgerald Field House

As a 1990 graduate of Pitt, I was stoked to
attend my first Panther Basketball game of the
year on Thursday. against Rutgers. During my time
there, a group of thirty or so from my dorm attend-
ed every home game, and the crowds at that time
produced enough noise that the field house sound- ’
ed like 20,000 people were squashed into the
6,500 seats available. Boy, how things have

\

changed.

During this particular game, it" became. quite
obvious to .me that the Panther fans, especially
those in the student section, were nothing like they
were during my time at your institution. The build-
ing was quiet, noise was non-existent, and there
wereonly a handful of basketball heads seenin the
crowd. Additionally, there was not a single “Penn
State Sucks” heard during the game. How disap-

pointing.

But all is not lost. One game ‘remains at the
Field House. Make ‘us alumni proud. Close the
Field House with pride. Be loud’, be crazy and be

supportive.

And for goodness’ sake, remember that “Penn
State Sucks” is a part of the Panther fight song.

HEATHER BOWLAN _
Senior Staff Writer

This season for Pitt’s Repertory Theatre, the theme of
many shows has been the loss of innocence. But for many
audience members, it may be lost patience. /,

Both “Waiting for Godot” and “The Emperor and the
Architect of Assyria” attempted to manipulate the traditional
narrative—driven plots of theater to better explore the frag-
mentation and disillusion of society. Both were fairly unsuc-
cessful in their attempts.’ Now,
and some of Pitt’s younger actors 
take on experimental theater in
their production of “The Serpent” by Belgian—bom Jean-
Claude van Itallie. And nobody can say they didn’t try.

Indeed, just as in “Godot” and “The Emperor,” the actors
throw themselves full-throttle into the project, a largely
movement-based piece exploring humanity’s ejection from
the Garden of Eden, juxtaposing it with the assassinations of
Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kennedys. Not to say this was
a bad idea — the strongest section of the play occurs when
actor Julie Moreau counts forward and backward from one to

12 as the other actors recreate these assassinations in a freeze-
frame format. '

But in 2002, the story of Genesis is, for the most part, .
bereft of its meaning —— all that’s left is an apple, a serpent and _

some sex. And that’s what we come away with after seeing
“The Serpent,” during which the actors offer their bitten
apples to audience members; wiithe, hiss, and ﬂick their
tongues in unison as that original evil snake; and simulate
intercourse in one big orgy.

It’s hard not to see “The Serpent” as soft—core porn at
moments like these, especially considering that everyone is
clad in V ripped, stretchy white fabric (designed by Sarah

.Andrews), and that every cast member but one is young,

nubile, and white. The one exception, Linda Hunt, unfortu-
nately continues the stigma plaguing many African-American
actors by portraying, in the words of critic A.O. Scott, “the
spirit of humanity” (she leads the others in playing percussion
instruments and singing a gospel), instead of a real, multi-
faceted character. '

Not that any of the other actors have substantial charac-
ters either. That is certainly not the point of this play. But as
easy and timely as it is to blame humanity’s faults on some
primordial loss of innocence, “The Serpent” does little to
tackle the more difficult question of how to regain this inno-
cence. It seems to imply, that joining hands and singing
“Imagine” will cause that mythical gate to Eden to reopen.
Although, considering that John Lennon himself was assassi-
nated in 1980, chances are it’s not all that simple.

-There are few subjects as difficult to address dra-
matically as terminal illness. How can a group of
actors, in under two and a half hours, try to attend to
the tremendous mixture of emotions — from heart-

break to humor, from anger to admiration — that

come with such an intense struggle to
live? All you have to do to see the
many productions that fall weH below
par is turn to the Lifetime Network any
day of the week. ' ‘

But lately, theater has managed to tackle this
issue with amazing vivacity and poignancy, as the

success of the Broadway hit “VVit” attests. And right

now at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, you can see “Joined

that many moments of the show seem almost cine-
matic.

This is certainly true of the opening, when we
first meet‘ the insecure, egotistical writer Maggie
Mulroney (Meghan Rose Heimbecker) among a
burst of people who ﬁll the small space in the middle
of the room, and then surround‘ the audience (seated
against all four walls) on raised platforms. Stephanie
Mayer’s set design literally immerses the audience in
the action of the play, as does the deftly chosen
soundtrack designed by J. C. Ciesielski.

But it is Heirnbecker and fellow actress Erika ‘_
Cuenca, who plays Maggy» Burroughs, the wife of «

Maggie’s high school boyfriend Jim (Shane
Portman) and cancer patient, who take Catherine
Butterﬁeld’s script and weave it into an engrossing
and powerful story. These women truly are their
characters; Heimbecker’s every movement and
expression is self—possessed in her portrayal of a
writer newly in the spotlight, while Cuenca’s ges-

tures and line delivery are calm, almost ephemeral. '
Her Maggy forces you to pay attention to her to 

the humor and strength beneath her modesty. .
Portrnan’s demeanor, appropriately restrained to

let the friendship of Maggie and Maggy take center
stage, is always one of subtly forced cheerfulness —
his squinted eyes and constant smile lead the audi-
ence to wonder how Jim reacts to Maggy’s illness
when he is alone — which we find out, in one of sev-
eral direct addresses between the actors and the audi-
ence, a choice onthe-part of the author that manages
to be refreshing and not just postmod-

em.
h John Shepard should be commend;
ed for his astute_direction — knowing

when to let the actors break loose emo-
tionally, but always keeping their reactions from
becoming cliche. “Joined at the Head” is a play
whose message will haunt you, and whose ending,
which is heartrending and hopeful at the same time,
will bring tears to your eyes long after it’s over.

Beat me at the
Crossroads

Crossroads

Starring Britney Spears, Taryn
Manning and Zoe Saldana
Directed by Tamra Davis
<£r1/2

The public service announcement
was brief. In white text on a black ﬁeld,
the words “How many times has your kid
been exposed to sex today?” ﬂashed
across the screen. '

Sadly, it seemed I was the only one
who recognized the irony of showing a
PSA for abstinence before a screening of
Britney Spears’ new movie
“Crossroads.” .

The PSA begs the question: Is it real-
ly a wise choice to market a ﬁlm whose
plot is driven by the sexual mores of three
teenage women to the 10- to 15-year-old
girl market?

The ﬁhn opens with a trio of little
girls burying a box of tchochkies from
their childhoods and swearing that they’ll
be best friends forever.

Eight years later, it’s the day before
their high school graduation, and we find
out that Lucy (Spears), Mimi (the
strangely-dentured Taryn Manning) and
Kit (sassy, snarky Zoe Saldana of “Center
Stage”) loathe each other for what
they’ve become: a child bride marrying

her high school sweetie right after gradu-

ation (Kit), a teenage mother (Mimi) and
a virginal Valedictorian prude (Lucy).
What would possess these three to go
on a cross-country road trip together -
with a good—1ooking.ex—con, of course —
could only be fodder for the most inane
chick movie ever committed to celluloid.
It must be said that Spears is a rela-
tively natural actress. Though she deliv-
ers a few clunkers, she does the best she
can with the material that she has.
Nevertheless, her facility with the screen-
play doesn’t excuse how oddly depress-
ing the ﬁlm really is. Among other

Thursday on Wednesday

Thursday, The Ghost,
The Movielife, _
Most Precious Blood
Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

Club Laga, $8

(412) 682-2050

Many individuals seem to be confused with the
genre of “emo.” Isn’t all rock emotional nowadays?

Victory Records recording artists Thursday will
headline a tour with Some Records recording artists
The’ Ghost, Drive-Thru’s The Movielife, and
Trustkill Records’ own Most Precious Blood tonight
at Club Laga for a show that will test emo’s 

Thursday joins the tour after returning from a
month-long European stint to promote their album,
Full Collapse. Thursday is what you could call emo-
tional hardcore, or ‘A‘emocore,” might be the best
term. The Ghost follows in the same vein. The
Movielife tends to have that pop-punk sound of
bands like Saves the Day (at least older Saves the
Day) and New Found Glory. Most Precious Blood is
made up of ex~members of Indecision, a well-
known hardcore band on Trustkill.

What makes Thursday so special? For one, they
have a music video on MTV2,“Understanding in a

Car Crash.” Another interesting fact about them is
that they’re playing this sumrner’s Van’s Warped
Tour once more. Last year, they only played a few
dates, but in 2002 they will play most of the shows.

In Full Collapse, Thursday vocalist Geoff
Rickley sings, “You can’t change the letters when
the ink dries.” His unique and beautiful voice has
captivated many listeners. Rickley tends to lay down
a passionate attitude toward his vocals, and they’re
ﬁlled with emotional screams. Surprisingly, every-
thing ﬂows together beautifully and melodically.

As for fellow tour members The Ghost, they’ve
got a bit more of a “happier” indie-rock sound.
Some Records made a great decision in signing
these guys. Very melodic, they mix the alternative
and indie genres very well. They sound very much
like Thursday, perhaps not as distinct, but they’ll be
a great supporting act.

The Movielife’s newest effort, ...Has a
Gambling Problem, demonstrates that the band has
matured over the past few years.

It will also be quite interesting to see a hardcore
band like Most Precious Blood at an indie-rock/emo
show, but it’s always nice to see a wide variety of
bands at a show. It tends to change the opinions of
people who might disregard a speciﬁc genre without
giving it a genuine opportunity.

Nevertheless, if you feel the need to see an ener-
getic live act, check out this show.

Spitting out the seeds
Over the Rhine 2
Tomorrow, 7:30 pm.

Rosebud
(412) 261-2221

‘If Linford Detweiler’s live performances are anything 0
like his studio efforts, he might as well buy a stage monkey
because he’s got the one man band thing practically covered.

Detweiler, who along with wife Karin Bergquist makes
up the band Over the Rhine, plays ‘as many as nine instru-
ments on the group’s latest album Films for Radio. '

The Ohio-based band will play at Rosebud tomorrow
night.

The fact is that Over the Rhine beneﬁts from the produc-
tion assistance that a studio provides or, as Ben Folds puts it,
“some producer with computers ﬁxes all my shitty tracks.”

Not to say that Over the Rhine is well,’ you know, shitty.
But their post-production work deﬁnitely propels Films. for

Radio from mediocre to good. What inevitably seems to hap- .

pen in studio to live transpositions is that musicians, are forced
to sing through odd bullhorns and microphone/ voice
enhancers to make their singing sound “right.”

The outcome is one of three possible outcomes. First: the
live performance sounds exactly like the album. Second: the
live performance sounds like aliens imitating the album. Or
third: the live performance sounds like the album, only better.

Most likely, Over the Rhine travels with a backup band,
and Detweiler’s instrumentation will be all but absent on
stage. And though that would be a shame, Berquist’s voice is
good enough to make up for the incongruence in the music
behind her. '

With God Forbid and Goatwhore
Tonight, 7:30 p.m.
M, $15, all ages
(412) 261‘ -2221

Violence has arrived .. . well, it will
soon. And when it does, be prepared for one
hell of a show tonight at M with Gwar, God

Forbid and Goatwhore.
Gwar, these guys from Virginia —— or

outer space, as they will tell you — are the -.

craziest band playing today. Gwar thrills,
shocks and disgusts die—hard fans and curi-
ous onlookers alike.

Many people know Gwar for “eating”
Jerry Springer alive when they appeared on
his talk show and for throwing stuﬁ at their
listeners like fake blood and other unidenti-
ﬁed substances. Be warned — if you’re
going, don’t forget to wear your rattiest
clothing, or maybe even a biohazard suit.

. Gwar operates completely under the “alter

egos” of Oderus Urtmgus on vocals, Balsac

the Jaws of Death and Flattus Maximus on .

guitar, drummer Jizmak da Gusha, bassist
Beefcake the Mighty and the solo femme
Slymenstra Hymen providing vocals and
dancing. They appear in mutant alien cos-
tumes complete with sex slaves, creatures
and even a storyline running throughout the
show. The storyline usually entails a plot
where their arch enemy, Techno Destructo,

tries to dominate the guys from Gwar and
take Slymenstra as his slave; it continues in
different directions from there.

If you are not into the visuals, but crave -
a heavy sound that doesn’t melt together in
a big cheesy clump of monotony, put this
into your musical potluck. Even the faint-
of-heart can ﬁnd something to like by
Gwar.

Primarily punk/metal, they also feature
an eclectic mix of sounds ranging from the
poppy, almost radio—f1iend1y “I— Suck On
My Thumb,” off the 1997 release Camival

. of Chaos to the torchy “Don’t Need a

Man,” from the same album, which has a
smooth bass line and slinky piano bars that
give the listener the ambient feeling of sit-
ting in a smoky lounge in the 1930s.

But that’s not what they’ll playtonight.

Gwar are performance artists as much as
they are musicians, and since their whole
rnise—en—scene consists primarily of pyro-
mania, bodily ﬂuids and monsters, they are

» sure to play old favorites like the catchy

metal-laden “Sick of You” or the furiously
rifﬁng “Saddam A Go-Go.”

Certainly there will be several picks off
last November’s Violence Has Arrived
album. Of the nine albums Gwar has
kicked out since their debut in 1988,
“Violence” is their heaviest, most metal
album to date. - _

Gwar is sure to put on a great show,
both theatrically and musically. Go and
dance in the pit and get slimed, or stand in
the back where it’s a little safer. Either way,
you’re in for a wild show. V

Donatas Zavackas’ three-pointer tied the game with 3.4 seconds remaining on
the clock to send last night’s game against Seton Hall into overtime.

Panthers surge in last six
minutes to force overtime

DON NGUYEN
Staff Writer

The Panthers traveled to East
Rutherford, N.J., last night to play a
relatively meaningless game, con-
sidering the lock they already have
on the Big East West conference.
For the first 33 minutes of the
game, they played that way.

But with what head coach Ben
Howland described as a “desire to
win,” the Panthers shook off the
sloppy play they exhibited for most
of the game to come from behind
two different times in regulation
against a Seton Hall team playing
various perplexing defenses. ‘

The first of the Panther come-
backs was mounted with just over

wk.

six minutes left in the game. Seton
Hall had just scored on two free
throws from guard John Allen, giv-
ing the Pirates an eight-point cush-
ion and the largest lead of the game.

The chance of a Panther win
was bleak, considering they hit less
than 35 percent of their shots up to
that point. ’

But in a fashion reminiscent of
the come-from-behind victories at
Syracuse and West Virginia, the
Panthers upped the intensity level
to mount a late-night run against the
tough Seton Hall defense.

Julius Page hit both free throws
after being fouled on the Panthers’
next possession.

The Pitt men’s basketball game
last night saw a birthday, a homecom-

champion crowned.

It was indeed an evening of spe-
cial occasions as the Panthers, the
nation’s 8th best college team, nar-
rowly squeezed out a 73-66 overtime
win at Seton Hall. Not only did the
win spoil senior night for the outgo-
ing Pirates, but it clinched the Big
East West division championship for
the Panthers (24-4 overall, '12-3 Big

hit his free throw to tie the game at
54. The Panthers took their first lead
of the second half on a layup by
Julius Page.

Page, who celebrated his 20th
birthday last night, celebrated in style
as he finished with 16 points and four
rebounds. He also converted on all of
his eight free—throw attempts and did
not commit a turnover. The Panther
lead increased to four points, but
Seton Hall would not fold. '

The Pirates scored the next seven
points, including crucial free throws

kept pace with ‘the Panthers, it was
able to mount a 7-0 run and take a
seven-point lead. The lead was the
Pirates’ largest of the first half.

Pitt responded with seven unan-
swered points of its own, but it could
not overcome the Pirates by halftime
and went into the breakdown by a
score of 38-32.

Forward Chevon Troutman led
the Panthers’ first half effort with
seven points. Troutman finished a
perfect four-for-four from the field
with nine points and four rebounds
before fouling out in the second half.

The Panthers’ second half was‘

eerily similar to their first. They
trailed by as many as nine points dur-
ing the half and would be forced to
play catch-up to stay in contention.
Then, with less than three min-
utes remaining, forward Donatas
Zavackas pulled down a missed
Panther field goal attempt, sank the
put-back and drew the foul, closing

ting only two of his first
12 shots from the field.
He finished with 15 points and 10
boards for the double double. A

With the score tied at 61, the con-
test was headed for overtime. Pitt
dominated the overtime period, not
allowing Seton Hall to score in the
final four minutes and 16 seconds.
Knight, who attended Seton Hall _Prep

12-0 run. He hit both the tying three-
pointer and the ‘go-ahead layup as he
finished with 19 points to lead all

“It was a. very physical game

“Our defense really kept us in the

Selwyn shines in Pitt’sf"1nal game

KAREN BIELAK

Assistant Sports Editor

It’s no secret that Laine Selwyn
can shoot, but last night she showed
just what kind of golden touch she
has.

Selwyn scored a career-high 32
points as the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team lost to Providence
College, 91-77, in its final game of
the season.

The loss eliminated the Panthers
from. the Big East Tournament to be
held next week in Piscataway, N.J.,
and left the team with a disappoint-

1 ing 8-19 record (3-13 in the Big

East) for the year.

' Selwyn led all players in scor-
ing and connected for eight of 14
field goalswhile hitting 16 of 17
shots from the free-throw line. She
added four rebounds and two
assists, but her effort was not
enough to hold off the Friars.

Providence "received career
from freshman ‘Jessica

Simmonds, who connected_ for 19
points, and guard Kristin Quinn,
who added 17 along with a game-
high nine rebounds.

The Friars also received double_- »

digit contributions from three other
players, as Dani Trippany and
Ryann Kilgore picked up 15 along
with 10 from Catrina Hawley-
Stewart. ‘
Providence shot 54 percent in
the first half to take a 50-37 lead at
halftime, and continued to put the
Panthers away’ in the second half.
The Friars took their largest lead of
the game, 19 points, at the 16:51
mark when they went up 57-38.
The Panthers’ offense picked up
in the second half as the team sunk
40 points while allowing 41 _by the
Friars, but the first half deficit was
too much to overcome. The 91
points registered is the highest total
for Providence this season. 7
Junior guard Brooke Stewart
finished with 11 points while fresh-
man Haley Harguth also added 11

off the bench, including three from
behind the arc. But the Panthers
also committed 19 turnovers and
had the ball stolen seven times.

The Friars held the advantage in
three—point shots, hitting 57 percent
for the game and nailing eight shots
from downtown in the first half.
They also held a slight edge on the
boards, out-rebounding the
Panthers 42-40.

Pitt finished a tough season in
which it lost a key player in junior
Mandy Wittenmyer, who was
plagued with injuries from the start
of the season before being perma-
nently sidelined in January. .

‘The Panthers and head coach
Traci Waites will not see postseason

’ action for the second year in a» row,

after receiving a berth in the
Women’s National Invitational
Tournament in 2000.

The Friars, who finished 13-~14
overall and 7-9 in the conference,
will enter the tournament as an
eighth seed.

Tennis tops Mercyhurst, falls to Marshall

SHAUN GRIFFIN
"Senior Staff Writer

If the women’s tennis team had
any rust lingering from its long
winter layoff, it didn’t show when it

split a couple of matches this week- ,

end._

Friday, at Monroeville’s Oxford
Athletic Center, Pitt handled
Mercyhurst College easily, winning

_ the meet 7-0.

On Saturday, the team traveled
down to the Huntington, W. Va.,
area to take on a highly regarded
team from Marshall. The women
lost 7-0, but the meet was much

V closerthan the score implies.

“It. was a good start to the sea-
son,” said head coach. George

‘Dieffenbach, whose team’s dual

meet record now stands at 2-
2.“There was a big difference
between the teams. Mercyhurst
doesn’t compare to Marshall.”

’ Sophomore Jill Williams and
junior Nikki Borza got the ball
rolling for Pitt in the No. 1 doubles
match on Friday. They downed
Mercyhurst’s best pair, Alison
Hughes and Brianne Pertricone, 8-4
in a single-game match.

In the second doubles match,
junior Brooke Yablonski and sopho-
more Laura Pegula had‘ about as
easy a time against Colleen
Sullivan and Lauren Dujanovich.
Yablonski and Pegula won 8-2. I

With two out of three doubles

already won and the important dou-
bles point secured, Pitt sent out
junior Jena Fiore and sophomore
Hayley Hughes in the third doubles
match for the sweep. They succeed-
ed, beating Joanna Olmstead and
Megan Mitman 8-2.

From there, it was on to the sin-
gles competition, and Williams met
up with Mercyhurst’s Hughes in
match No. 1. Williams dispatched
her foe-in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1.

Borza was in the second match
against Petricone. Borza won all but
one game, 6-0, 6-1.

Pegula beat Olmstead 6-1, 6-1

_ in match No. 3.

It took Fiore only the minimum
amount of games to take down
Sullivan 6-0, 6-0.

Yablonski didn’t have much
trouble against Dujanovich winning
6-0, 6-1. - " ‘

And Pitt’s Hughes rubbed it in,
beating Mitman 6-0, 6-0 and shut-
ting‘Mercyhurst out of the meet in
the process. , ~

But on Saturday, Dieffenbach
said, “reality set in pretty quickly.”

.“They’re one of the best teams
in the East,” said Dieffenbach of
Marshall. “The’y’re attackers and
they’re very coached.” .

Pretty much the entire Marshall
team is made up of foreign play_ers,
all of whom would be among the
best in their respective countries.

Williams and Borza took on a
pair of Russians, Anna Metina and

. J -

Alice Sukner, and lost 8-0.
Yablonski and Pegula took on
an American duo, Jessica Johnson
and Ashley Croh, and lost 8-2.
Swiss-born Joelle Good and Brit
Danielle Hock. beat Fiore and

Hughes'8-1 to complete the doubles"

sweep.
Dieffenbach, called Williams’

singles match against Johnson the

best of the weekend.

Williams lost the first set 7-5, 1

won the second 6-4 and lost the
third 6-2.

“Williams went up against one
of the best in the East — she was
No. 100 in the nation last year,”
Dieffenbach said. “Williams was
really close with her. It just shows
how much Jill has improved.”

Borza lost to Metina 6-0, 6-1 in .

straight sets. Good beat Pegula 6-1,
6-0. .

Then Fiore took on'Lily Nzudie
and lost 6-3, 6-0.

_“Fiore won three games against
one of the best players from
Cameroon, a Venus Williams-type
player,” Dieffenbach said.

Yablonski put up a fight against
Hock, losing 6-4, 6-2.

Megan Skalski
Hughes, 6-1, 6-3.

“You got to look at the posi-
tives,” Dieffenbach said of the loss
to Marshall. “They’re the best team
on our schedule. We were not shut
out at all. Whoever we play from
now on should not phase us.”

The Pirates were then thwarted
by the Panthers’ defense.

The ball was quickly turned
back upcourt to Page, who found
forward Donatas Zavackas in the
corner for a three-pointer that cut
the deficit in half.

Over the next three minutes, the
Pirates folded under the pressure of
the Panthers’ urgent defense, while

two more strong efforts from Page ‘

and Zavackas on the offensive side
of the court tied the game at 54 with
3:40 left in the game.

In what might have been among
the wildest three minutes of basket-
ball this -season, the Panthers

gained a four-point advantage on

baskets from Page and Brandin
Knight. r
Knight’s shot was important

‘because he broke what had previ-

ously been a stingy Seton Hall
defense. Up until that point, the
Panthers had been forced to take a
lot of outside perimeter shots,
which was not effective when con-
sidering they hovered around 20
percent fromvoutside the are for
most of the game.

Knight drove past -Seton Hall’s
Andre Barrett into the paint, hitting
a floater over two defenders who
moved up to cover thepenetrating
Panther guard.

Fromthere, Seton Hall would
pull off a run of its own, going on a
7-0 run that left the Panthers down
61-58 with 15 seconds remaining.
Pitt missed numerous opportunities
at scoring points during that span,
temporarily cooling offfor what
would be a fantastic regulation time
finish. ‘

With the game hanging in the
balance, Knight burned the Pirate
defense once again. After drawing

, two defenders to himself on the out-

side perimeter, Knight dished. the
ball to a wide-open Zavackas, who
drained a straightaway three-point-
er to send the game into overtime.
In overtime, the Panthers would
go on to play like the top 10 team
that they are, ending the period on a
12-0 run. But considering the way
the Panthers were stiﬂed by the
Pirates for the first half of the con-

test, the team’s eventual success at
