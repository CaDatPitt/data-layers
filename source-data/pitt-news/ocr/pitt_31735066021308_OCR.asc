  HUNDRED FOURTEEN

Chinese students at Pitt Worry for families at home

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

As a result of the Chinese govern-
ment’s military suppression of the student
protests in Tiananmen Square this past
weekend, Pitt’s Chinese community is
experiencing a growing concern for the
future of their homeland and for the fate

of their families and friends still living in
China. Beijing native Dian Qing Xu, a
Pitt graduate student in economics, has
many family members and friends still in
Beijing. As of Tuesday afternoon, he has
not been able to contact any of them or
receive any information about their safety
and whereabouts.

“I am worried about them,” he said,

“but the phone lines have been busy for
days.”

According to Tuesday’s New York
Times, the ofﬁcial death toll in China has
not yet been determined. However, pro-
jections range from 200 dead to as many
as 1,500 dead since Saturday when China’s
senior communist party leader Deng Xi-

aoping and Premier Li Peng ordered the A

People’s Liberation Army to converge on
T iananmen Square and forcibly remove
the student protesters.

Chinese university students began their
vigil in the square on May 13. Originally,
the student demonstrators called for the
establishment of freedom of speech in
China. However, in following weeks, the

For The Pitt News

The world of desperate pa-
tients, dedicated doctors, and the
frustrating reality of the limits of
modern medical technology is
detailed in an award-winning
book by University of Pittsburgh
English professor Lee Gutkind.

The book, entitled Many Sleep-
less Nights, is a probing account
into the lives of organ donors and
recipients, as well as the medical
personnel which make the pro-
cedures possible. Gutkind re-
searched the topic for four years,
during which he visited a multi-
tude of medical facilities, both
national and international, where
he studied the physicians, pa-
tients and the taxing emotional
environment that organ transplan-
tation precipitates.

He worked side by side with
transplant recipients and candi-
dates, and took calls with sur-
geons and residents at all hours
of the day. Gutkind ﬂew with
special organ procurement teams
as they attempted to acquire and
rapidly transport fresh organs for
transplantation from areas all over

, the country. He also participated

()>

in the “psychosocial evaluation”
of recipients and candidates.
His appetite for information
led him to visit leading transplant
centers at Stanford, Columbia-
Presbyterian Hospital in New
York, the Texas Heart Institute,
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and

- Cambridge University in England.

However, it was Presbyterian-
University Hospital, on the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s campus,
who Gutkind credits as. provid-
ing the bulk of his information.
Gutkind was generously granted
unconditional access to the hos-

High student loan defaulttrate prompts federal proposal .

By Lou Grieco ’
News Editor

Even though Secretary of Edu-
cation Lauro F. Cavazos has
moved to punish schools where
large numbers of graduates do
not pay back their student loans,
Pitt has little to be concerned
about, according to an Admis-
sions and Financial Aid official.

“Fortunately, we don’t have that
problem,” said Kevin Altomari,
executive associate director in
charge of aid for Pitt. “We’re
doing what we're supposed to
do.” 0

The proposed rules‘ state that
schools with default rates of 60
percent or more could be ex-
cluded’ from the student loan
program in the future’. Schools
with default rates of 40 to 60
percent would be required to
lower the rate five percentage
points each year or be punished.
Pitt’s rate was listed as 6.1 per-
cent by the Department of Edu-

 >

cation.

“We realize that it is our re-
sponsibility to educate students
as to what debt is and how to pay

, it back. We do that, A lot of other

institutions do not, " Altomari said.
Altomari also said that ' the
government was attacking the
schools because it “is not going
to be as aggressive toward the
lenders. The government needs
the lenders to continue the pro-
gram, and it has to go after the
institutions.” '
Bush administration officials
have estimated that defaults on
studentloans will cost taxpayers
$1.8 billion this year, eight times
more than what it cost eight years
ago. ._ ’
Altomari attributed the increase
to the fact that “less students get
grants today than they did eight
years ago. Loans are like a last
resort, and more students have to
turn to them today than before.
“Even beyond that, the student
that graduates from Pitt with a

bachelor's degree in liberal arts
enters a difficult job market, with
the cost of living constantly in-.
creasing. If a student takes out a
loan of $10,000 and pays it back
over a period of 10 years, that is
approximately $120 a month in

payments, and that is a signifi-

cant amount.”

Ross Perilman, president of the
Western School of Health and
Business Careers, called the fig-
ures “inaccurate and unfair.” The
school's default rate was esti-
mated by the Department of
Education at 51.5 percent.

“This makes our school look
bad, and it's not our fault,” Peril-
man said. “We don’t do the loan
collecting, the lender agencies
do. We can’t force them to pay
back their loans after they gradu-
ate.” _ 1

Perilman agreed that the gov-
ernment was trying to punish the

schools because they make eas-

ier targets. He added that before
the government began to‘ crack

down on default loans in 1987,
the lending agencies did not send
delinquency rosters to the school,
so the school did not know who
was neglecting their debts. The
ﬁgures were compiled during this
time period under former Secre-

tary of Education William Ben-

nett. _
He also said that his school was
at risk because it accepted a large

number of economically disad— V

vantaged students, “Some of our
students start off at $12,000 a
year. It's hard for them to make
monthly payments of $50. That’s
why these kids should be getting
grants, not loans. ,
“The bottom line is that th

government is making us look
bad. Some people are saying that
our education is not quality be-
cause of this. We have a place-

ment rate of 87 to 92 percent, and

we can document that.”
Grove City College registered
one of the lowest ratings with 1.0

Gutkind

pital, which is the world’s largest
transplant center.

The achievement of Gutkind
has not gone unnoticed. He has
been honored with the receipt of
two awards for his book, includ-
ing the Blakesly Medical Jou rnal-
ism Award presented by the
American Heart Association, and
the Library Journal Award for
best medical book of the year. In

 

his book. Despite his lack of
medical background, he was able
to penetrate deep into an ex-
panding and controversial field
of medicine. Gutkind also cites
the fact thathe had been aware of
the career of Dr. Thomas Starzl,
the world-renowned chief trans-
plant surgeon at Presbyterian-
University Hospital. He has great
respect for what he calls “Starzl’s
heroism” for battling to save the

transplantation,” Gutkind says.
He relays the harsh reality that
even with the selection, “approxi-
mately 50 percent of all adults
and perhaps 40 percent of infants
and young children  will die
while waiting for a donor.” An-
other problem lies in the general
unwillingness of relatives to
donate a loved one’s body parts.

Gutkind feels the awards are a
bonus to the personal satisfac-

their topics before recording
anything on paper and that the
effort has personal meaning as
well as designs on public recog-
nition.

However, Gutkind says the
research was not without its dif-
ficulties. He found it a challenge
to capture the trust of the medical
personnel whose busy schedules
allowed them little time to chaper-
one a visitor. In addition he had

students added economic reform
and an end to rampant govern-
ment corruption to their list of
requests.

All reports from China con-
firmed that their protests were
orderly and peaceful. Despite the
peaceful behavior of the students, -
Li declared martial law in Beijing
on May 20 and ordered the stu-
dents to disperse from the square.

Later in May, the students,
still in the square, rallied around
a newly constructed 55- foot statue
similar to the Statue of Liberty in
the United States. They named
the statue the “Goddess of

Democracy.”

Xu said he agrees with the
students’ requests for a new
capitalistic economic system and
for an official investigation into
the current government corrup-
tion.

“I don’t know what will
happen next, but I do think that
the people will win,” Xu said.
“No one government can kill all

A the students.”

Xu said he believes China’s
top leaders are “crazy.”

He goes as far as to call Li
“worse than I-Iitler” because, he
said, “to my knowledge Hitler

“All societies believe that

The events of this past week-
end and early this week have left
the city of Beijing and now Shang-
hai in a state of pandemonium.
The Chinese army now occupies
Tiananmen Square and the
“Goddess of Democracy” has
been destroyed. But protests
continue throughout these cities
as the common Chinese citizens
are sympathizing with the stu-
dents’ requests and resenting the
slaughter of the students by the

Tim Xie, another native Chi-
nese Pitt student, is also waiting
for news from friends in Beijing.

According to Xie, almost all
of the Chinese students locally
support the Beijing students in
their demonstrations and respect
them for their courage.

Last Sunday, 200 Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University stu-
dents marched through the streets
of Oakland to show their sup-

port for the students and outrage-

for the brutality" of the Deng
government.

“The only words that can
express the way I feel toward the

lChinesel government is anger.

and hatred," Xie said.

Pitt political science profes-
sor Irwin Schulman, who special-
izes in Chinese political affairs,
claims the student demonstra-
tions of the past several weeks

are a result of a “revolution of
rising expectations” on the part
of the students. The students’ ex-
pe(:t.at,i_on§,-for economic change
were growing at a more rapid
pace than the government's.

“The students were seen ini-
tially by lDengl as going a bit too
far,” Schulman said. “I think that
was a ‘very stupid misreading of
the situation.”

George Bush takes NATO
by storm with reductions

George Bush made his mark at the NATO summit; he
emerged on the wings of his arms reductions proposal.
Bush managed to divert the Soviets from their proposal to
reduce the number of nuclear missiles deployed in Eu-
rope. The reason that this is such a triumph for Bush is that
his proposal shifts the arms reduction balance in favor of
the ‘United States by asking for percentage cutbacks in
armed forces. Since the Soviets have a greater number of
troops in Europe, they will be removing a far greater
number of troops than we will. Bush's proposal met with
enthusiasm from the NATO countries, and even the
Soviets called it “a serious and important step in the right
direction.”

While it is reassuring to know that Bush is capable of
pulling off this kind of political maneuver, taking steps
toward peace and at the same time appeasing the
Europeancommunity, it is also important that the issue of
nuclear arms in Europe be addressed. The agreement that
Bush proposed leaves the door open for future negotia-
tion on the subject. It is to be hoped that when these
discussions take place that serious efforts toward thinning
out the nuclear arsenal in Europe will be made, rather

than another American president pulling another distract-
ing rabbit out of his policy hat.

Fee_ling the sun burning down on

in life.

For instance, as I was pulling
out of the clock, the realization
that students were dying in Tian-
anmen Square in Beijing, China,
all in the name of democracy,
ﬂooded into my consciousness.

I yanked the main sheet in, let
the sails pull me across the water,

thoughts just vanished!

Ethics should transcend party loyalty  

I can’t say that I was too im-
pressed with Jim Wright’s fare-
well speech to Congress last week.

It’s not thatl don’t feel sorry for
him. Seeing a 66-year-old man
cry as his world disintegrates in
front of the entire nation could
make even Ghengis Kahn feel
sorry for him. However, there is
only one person to blame for
Wright’s problems, and that is
Wright himself.

Wright has placed part of the

‘blame on the media, which is

 

probably the only idea guaran-
teed to gain bipartisan support in
Congress. However, the press
didn’t create anything, it just re-
lated what had happened.

Mr. Wright also blames the other
party. Sure, it was a Republican,
namely Newt Gingrich, R—Ga.,
who persisted in hunting him

‘ down. Every indication does point
to Gingrich being an opportunis-
tic, nasty type of guy who en-
joyed what happened. The last to

stand as the members of the

house applauded Wright, Gin-
grich gleefully brags that he has
the names of close to 10 other
House Democrats who have been
unethical.

But it was Wright who had '69
ethics violations brought against
him, under bipartisan scrutiny.

As a registered Democrat,-I am
appalled that it was a member of

a sleek, 5.2-meter Boston Whaler,
admiring a clear, blue sky cap-
ping a beautiful Lake Erie?

The thought of Iranians cmshed
to death in attempts to catch
glimpses of the air-conditioned
body of the deceased Ayatollah
Khomeini can’t penetrate when a
puff of wind ﬁlls my sails and lets
my bow cut through waves like a
hot knife through cream_ cheese.

Christopher Cross had it wrong.
Sailing doesn’t take me away to

my party who became the first

speaker of the House ever to‘
resign because of charges against 4

his character. In fact, I would be
appalled regardless of the man's
party. '

Unfortunately, for many politi-
cians and other political zealots,
unethical behavior, like propa-
ganda, only exists in the other
guy’s camp.

When John Tower’s nomina-
tion as secretary of defense came
under question, many Republi-

cans claimed that the Democrats '

were trying to sabotage the new
administration. George Bush
claimed that the reports of Tower’s
behavior were untrue (what else
. was he going to say?). Sam Nu nn,
D-Ga., was accused of attacking
Tower’s character for party rea-
sons. .
The thought of Nunn, a man
who has never towed the party

line and has often served as a.

swing vote for Republicans on
certain issues, trying to do some-
thing for party reasons is absurd.
" What is really disturbing is that
the Republicans resorted to leak-
ing rumors, later found to be
true,iof a drunken driving con-
viction against Nunn in the 19605.
It is even more disturbing that the
Republicans did not even con-
front the charges against Tower
that concerned unethical deal-
ings with defense contractors.
Gingrich, self-appointed Congres-
sional conscience, didn’t speak
up that time.

So ethics in politics seem to
follow a rule that an acquain-

where I wantto go;' it just takes
me away, period. When I sail, I
don’t feel like going anywhere in
particular. That's not the point.
We all have our own little tricks
of dealing with the more un-
pleasant facts of life._ That's how
we survive from day to day. One
man's sailboat is another man's
Corvette or racquetball orjohnny
Walker or Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade.

But things that seem far away
must be seen for what they really I

lance once told me: legal is what
you can get away with-

This is sad. It is even worse that
people who are dedicated to the

parties seem to make excuses for T

their candidates, while aggres-
sively accusing members of the
opposite party whenever the op-
portunity arises.

Republicans will say that Ol-
iver North is a hero, because he
was “just following orders” (the
same logic making all Nazis
except Hitler heroes). Former
President Ronald Reagan, who

gave these illegal orders, is not .,

viewed as being guilty either, but

the Democratic-controlled Con-,‘ T I

gress, whichidared to make a‘ law

that Reagan didn’t like, is judged ‘ ii

guilty. Never mind that Reagan
and ‘his gang of merry rogues
subverted the democratic proc-
ess that they claimed to be trying

to spread. The checks and bal- ; 
ances were written into the ~  

Constitution for a reason.

To be quite honest, I must 
admit that some Democrats have 7 
also been guilty of thelsame 
duplicity. . 

Maybe I’m too idealistic. One

would hope that people would
expect their elected representa-z
tives to behave in an honest and 
respectable manner, instead ’of'_”;T; 
denying the truth when it glares

at them.

So cry as much as you like, Mr: , 
Wright. You have disgraced your '
party as well as yourself. I do feel  
for you, but I cannot defend you. V

to witness the 1985 passage of
-Halley’s comet from one of the
best vantage points on the planet.
He bagged the Halley’s trip,
dropped out of the University of 5

Pixies
Continued from page 6
ies are already adored in England
for the lacerating sound of the
import platters Come on Pilgrim
and Surfer Rosa. The brilliant
new Doolittle, the Pixies’ formal
UQS. debut on Electra, should
have ‘em swooning here, too.
“I’_m just a college dropout
who "always wanted to be in a
band," says Thompson, a portly,
boyish-looking lad of 23 who
records under the name of Black
Francis. “When you start like
that, you just kind of go for it.
You figure, I’ll be louder and
faster and wackier than everyone
else.”
He was certainly luckier than
most. The Pixies -— Thompson,
guitarist and fellow Amherst

dropout joey Santiago, bassist
Kim Deal and drummer David
Lovering — were still appren-
ticing in Boston clubs when their
demo tape fell through the mail-
box of Britain's /I A.D. Records.
The label, home to the space-
pop aesthetes the Cocteau Twins,
complained that the Pixies
sounded “too American” i.e., loud
and obnoxious, according to Kim
Deal. But the label signed the
band anyway and released eight
of the demo’s songs as Come on
Pilgrim to ecstatic U.K. press
response.

The Pixies can be delightfully
artless on Doolittle (T hompson’s
Iggyesque bawl; the wayward
strafing guitars on “Debaser” and

“T ame”), even coy (the gnarly

pop allure of “Here Comes Your
Man”). But the way Thompson
shoehorns sexual obsession,

graphic violence, goofy humor
and religious iconography into
musical telegrams — bursts of
rage and revelation on “Wave of
Mutilation,” “I Bleed" and “Mon-
key Gone to Heaven,” a corro-
sive, compelling meditation on
God and garbage —- transcends
mere naivete. This is, after all, a
young man who was raised in
Southern California on a duel
diet of classic-rock angst (the
Stones, Iggy Pop) and religious
fundamentalism (his parents
joined a Pentecostal church when
he was 12) and swears by David

Lynch’s jarring juxtapositions of
beauty, terror and whimsy in ﬁl ms
like Eraserbead and Blue Velvet.
“If anything is a big influence on
me, it’s David Lynch,” Thompson
says. “He’s really into presenting
something but not explaining it.
It's just ‘This is an image, this is an
idea, isn't it cool?’ The way I
understand it, that's the only way
to be surreal. To be not so con-
nected with it, except that it came
from your brain, somewhere way
back there,"

Sometimes the A stands for
“accident.” For example, thereis

it that way. “Actually, I don’t
even know the words to a lot of
the songs,” Deal admits. “And
they’ve never been explained to
me.”

Which is no big deal. Ulti-
mately, Thompson aspires to the
visceral impact of his own favor-
ite songs, like “Gimme Shelter”
and “The Passenger” by Iggy Pop.
“Those great songs,” he says,
“that rez_I\,_.IT;¥ meant something the
first tirr’ii”:“’:‘l heard them.”

Thompson used for the hook at
first. It sounded so good he left

For The Pitt News

Three of Pitt’s men's track
elite were named All-Ameri-
can last weekend at the NCAA
track and field’ championships
in Provo, Utah. ’

Eric Cannon and Elbert
Ellis both had All-American
performances in the 110-meter
hurdles. Dave Moore ﬁnished
eighth in the 800 run to be-
come an All-American.

Pitt claims three All-Americans

Ellis had a personal best
time of 13-minutes, 77 seconds
to complement Cannon’s school
record-breaking time of :13.21.
Cannon, who finished second,
broke Roger Kingdom’s school
record of :13.44, set in 1983.

Pitt track coach john
Vasvary gave the highest praise
to Cannon.

“He’s going out in style,”
said Vasvary. “We’ll never re-
place his leadership, dedica-
tion, and discipline. He’s earned

it”

Other standouts in the

of Southwest Louisiana State,
who set an American record in
the high jump. Dawn Sowell of
Louisiana State University set
NCAA records in the women’s
100 and 200 runs.

When a sports season comes to
a close, it's always hard for a
coach to say good-bye to his
departing seniors. This task is
especially difficult when one of
the seniors is a three-time All-
American and performing better
than ever.

This was the case when Pitt
track hurdler Eric Cannon ran his
final race for Pitt last weekend at
the NCAA championship meet in
Utah.

“He would fit the Greek idea of
the whole man. He’s been an
outstanding performer for us in
more ways than you can ever
say, " said Pitt Coachjohn Vasvary.
"We may have someone come

here and eventually mn faster,

but we'll never get anyone else to _

be another Eric Cannon for us in
terms of leadership. Everybody,
from our javelin throwers to our
distance runners, looked to Eric
for leadership.”

Cannon’s collegiate track per-
formances cover an impressive
four years at Pitt. He won numer-
ous Big East and IC4A (Easterns)
individual championships. He
was also part of many relay cham-
pionship teams. Many of those
relay teams Cannon was part of
hold Pitt school records, includ-
ing the shuttle hurdle relay team
in 1987 and the 4x200-meter
hurdle team in 1988.

Last year Cannon won three
individual Big East champion-
ships. The 110 hurdles, the 100

dash and the 200 dash events all
went to Cannon. For his efforts
Cannon was named the 1988 Big
East most outstanding performer.

But, according to Vasvary, this
year was Cannon’s best. He won
more Big East titles, added an-
other IC4A title and was named
All-American for the third con-
secutive year. Last weekend at
the National championships,
Cannon set a new Pitt record in
the 110 hurdles. His time of 13-
minutes, 21 seconds broke the
previous record of :13.44 set by
two-time Olympic gold medalist
Roger Kingdom.

However, Cannon lost that race
by a narrow margin to Robert
Reading of the University of
Southern California.

“He lost by not even a blink of

The women’s track team ﬁn-
ished what was, according to Pitt
Coach Steve Lewis, “a great year”

compete at the National Champi-
onships in Provo, Utah this past
weekend.

The four who competed were:

dash, Clarissa Dudley, Pat Cupid,

an eye,” said "Vasvary. “just by
looking at it you couldn’t see the
difference. You had to look at the
film to see that he did get beat.”

It was Cannon’s personal best
time ever by .23 seconds, and
only his second loss in the 110
hurdle event all year. His first loss
came in his ﬁrst race of the year.

According to Walt Murphy, ’

editor of Eastern Track maga-

- zine, that race makes Cannon the .

12th all-time track performer in
the world since the beginning of
track. It ranks him the sixth all-
time performer in United States
history. This is in terms of all his

‘performances, not just one spe-

ciﬁc race. ' '

As impressive a feat that is,
Cannon is also impressive off the

and Debbie Bonner, who joined
Demas in the 4-x400 relay.
In the 400, Demas ran a 53.55.

She took 11th place overall, and '

ﬁfth place in her heat. Her 11th-
place finish at the NCAAs is even
more impressive considering
other factors, according to Lewis.
“As a sophomore, to be 11th in
the country, is something to be
very proud of,” said Lewis.

track.

“He’s been on the Athletic
Directo_r’s Honor Roll, and he’s
been a great leader for our
younger athletes to watch. You
couldn’t ask for any more as a
coach,” said Vasvary. 3

"Pitt women’s track coach Steve
Lewis has worked often with
Cannon.

“Eric is an entity in himself,”
said Lewis. “Considering the
things he’s done for the Pitt track
team and what he’s done as a
student, I think that he is the
epitome of what a student/ath-
lete should be. Everything I’ve

asked him to do and to commit ,
himself to he has done withthe, .

utmost energy.”

September 16, 1981, was
billed as The Showdown —
Sugar Ray Leonard and Tho-
mas “The Hit Man” Hearns in
a welterweight title uniﬁcation
bout. Next Monday night, the
two will meet again in what
has been dubbed by promoter
Bob Arum as The War.

Eight years, 20 pounds and

two will step into the ring to
settle a score that has been on
the minds of most boxing fans,
and most of all, the mind of
Thomas Hearns. ,

Leonard came into the first
fight with a record of 30-1, 21
by knockout. His only loss
came at the hands of Roberto
Duran on June 20, 1980, in
Montreal — 15 rounds of fury
as Leonard turned into a back-
alley brawler for the fight to
prove he was not just a pretty
boxer. Leonard lost the 15-
round decision, but ﬁve months
later, he made amends in the
rematch when Duran said “No
mas,” and Leonard was
awarded an eighth-round
knockout.

Hearns came into the ﬁrst
ﬁght with even more spec-
tacular numbers: 32-0, 30 by
knockout. Only six of those
knockouts came after the fourth
round. The ﬁght that made
everyone stand and take no-
tice of I-learns was his August

five world titles later, these-

2, 1980, second-round knockout
of Pipino Cuevas. in which he
won the World Boxing Associa-
tion welterweight title. Leonard
had won the World Boxing
Council welterweight title in 1979
by beating Wilfred Benitez. He
then lost it to Duran, and then
regained it.

Their ﬁrst fight started differ-
ently from what anyone had
expected. Hearns started off as
the boxer, and Leonard had to
look for the big punch. Hearns
was using his jab so well that by
the middle of the third round,
there was a welt under Leonard’s
left eye. Hearns took four of the
first five rounds for outboxing
Leonard. Hearns repeatedly went
to the ribs with his left hook and
then to the face.

Rounds six, seven and eight
were probably the most impor-
tant of the ﬁght. I-learns was
hitting Leonard with his best shots

to the body and the head, but 1

they did not stop Leonard; he
was able to counter with numer-
ous left hooks to both the body
and the head of Hearns. In round
seven, Hearns began showing
what effect Leonard’s punches
were having on him: a little
swelling showed under I-learns’

 

eyes. Also in the seventh round,
for the first time, referee Davey
Pearl had to break up the ﬁght-
ers.
Rounds nine, ten and eleven
went to Hearns as he started to
box again. In the 11th round,
Leonard’s left eye was just about
closed. Round 12 also went to
Hearns; he continued to punish
Leonard in the body with right
hooks, and his jab closed Le-
onard’s left eye. Round 13 had
Leonard down six, five and
four points on the judges’ score
cards. Fighting out of despera-
tion then, Leonard charges at
Hearns and in the mix-up,
Hearns fell to the canvas. It_ was
ruled a slip. Leonard started to
connect to Hearns’ jaw, and
Hearns fell through the ropes
and was tangled up in the sec-
ond strand. Hearns said no
knockdown, but Leonard kept
after him, and Hearns ended up
sitting on the bottom rope. Pearl
counted to nine as the bell
sounded and Hearns survived
the round. Leonard. came out
for round 14‘ and continued the
punishment to Hearns’ head.
Pearl checked Hearns and let
him continue. Leonard de1iv- ~
ered 25 unanswered punches
with the last four being straight
lefts. The ﬁght was stopped at
1:45 of the 14th round.
Many who saw the ﬁght live
think that if Heams had kept on

boxing instead of trying to land
bombsin the middle rounds, he
would have been able to sur- «-
vive and defeat Leonard on
points. By trying to land the big
punch, -Hearns was showing
Leonard everything he had.
Leonard was able to survive and
could take anything Hearns had
to give him. _

It seemed that only Angelo
Dundee, who was Leonard’s
chief cornerman, felt that Le-
onard could and would knock
Hearns out. Gus D’Amato ob-
served that Hearns may have
been too impressed with his
own knockout record and did
not work on his defense when
he should have been trying to
get away from Leonard or trying
to tie him up.

This time, the ﬁghters are both
over 30. Leonard will be 33, and
Hearns is almost 31. ‘

This will be Leonard’s ﬁfth
fight since he fought Hearns in
1981. Of those, two were very
big ﬁghts. In 1987, he stepped
up in ‘weight to defeat Marvin
Hagler for the middleweight
crown. Last November, Leonard

' moved up again to take on Don

Lalonde for the super middle-
weight title. Now 35-], with 25
knockouts, Leonard is giving
the only rematch of his career to
date. '
Since the last ﬁght in 1981,

Heams hasbeen more than busy.

.that sent , _.;
Please see Boxing, page 9 ’ 1 _ _.“'

Leonard's patience will outmatch Hearns  

His record is now 46-3, 38
knockouts, but his three losses
have also come by the way of
knockouts. I-learns has moved
up and down in weight classes.
In 1987, he defeated Dennis
Andries for the WBC light heavy-
weight title. Later that year he
went back down to middle— .
weight and defeated Juan »
Domingo -Roldan by knockout
in four rounds for the WBC
middleweight title.

There are four ﬁghts thatstand
out for Hearns since the Le-
onard ﬁght. Inju ne 1984, Hearns
took on Roberto Durant in a

' defense of his WBC super

welterweight title. Hearns de-
stroyed what appeared to be
an unprepared Duran in two
rounds. It was after this ﬁght
that Hearns announced he
wanted to take on Hagler.

Hearns got his wish, and in -

April 1985, the two squared off. .
Immediately, Hearns turned the
fight into a brawl. Hearns
opened ..a cut under I-_lagler’s
right .eye. The cut was bad
enough for referee Richard, 3
Steele to ask the ring physician
to look at it early in the third
round. ‘Hagler sensed he might
lose his title if thecut got any
worse and ﬁnished Hearns off

with three punches: a body

shot, a lunging right to the jaw

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 7, W89

Continued from page 8
around the ring, and a left hook
which ended it.

In June 1988, Hearns, in his
first defense of his \X/BC middle-
weight title, came out boxing
against Iran Barkley. In the third
round, Barkley was able to land
a looping right which sent Hearns
falling on his back. On the way
down Barkley was able to land
one more right hand. Hearns beat
the count, but Barkley jumped all
over Hearns and the ﬁght had to

had to survive a fourth—round
knockout to register a 12—round
win by decision.

On Monday, Hearns and Le— H

onard will come into the ring at
approximately 165 pounds. Many
feel the extra weight will be a
handicap for Ieonard. He won’t
be able to take the punches of a
stronger, bigger man. But the
idea in boxing is not to get hit,
and no one is better than Leonard
at not getting hit.

The extra weight will not be prob-
lem for Hearns. He will still hit hard.
He always has and always will. The
problem for Hearns is that he forgets
he is a good boxer, and he tries to
slug it out with his opponents. When
doing so, he leaves himself wide
open for shots from a good boxer,
like Leonard, or even a not—so—good
boxer, like Barkley.

Leonard has taken some good
shots, so if you are going to go to the
Civic Arena and watch it on closed-
circuit TV, look for him to come out

him pay.

Hearns is harder to figure
out. In the dressing room
before the Barkley fight,
Hearns said he was just going
to box and set Barkley up for
the big fall. As it turned out,
he did box, but he ended up
taking the big" fall. Hearns
should remember that he had
great success when he boxed
against Leonard in the first
fight and should try to outlast
him and win by decision. On

for the quick kill.

Look for Leonard to wait
and take his time like he did
against Lalonde. He will work
the body and make Hearns
pay for any mistakes. Ifi-learns
decides to come out and box,
Leonard will win just like he
did against Hagler. By con-
trolling the tempo, Leonard
will be ahead on points when
he putsglklgairns through the
ropes justllike the last light.
This time, Leonard will not
