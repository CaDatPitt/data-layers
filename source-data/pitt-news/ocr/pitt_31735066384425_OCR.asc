FAS Guns Down ROTC Credit Quest With 63-30 Salvo

By JIM MORRISON

Pin News Staff Writer

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to reinstate College of
Arts and Sciences credit for ROTC courses.

The vote was 63 against and 30 in favor, with 25 absentee
ballots—not enough to reverse the outcome—yet to be
counted.

The decision marks the second time in three years FAS
has failed to reverse its 1968 veto of ROTC accreditation.
Three weeks ago CAS Council approved the proposal which
would have allowed some 120 Army and Air Force cadets to
count up to 12 credits of ROTC courses toward graduation.

 

Debate at Tuesday’s meeting revolved around several
issues, including the content, value and effects of ROTC
instructionﬁ the military’s place in a university, and the costs
and beneﬁts of the ROTC program to Pitt.

Cadet Terry Regan told faculty members at the meeting
that “ROTC courses are on a par with any other courses
offered by the University, ” and ‘ ‘a vote for the resolution is
a vote for the student.” .

Cadet Scott O’Neil said ‘ ‘courses have changed and so has
society. ” He added that denial of CAS credit is bringing an
‘ ‘unfair burden’ ’ and “forcing some students to enlist or go
elsewhere.” i

Speaking against the proposal, physics professor John
Townsend said the “similarity” between CAS,and ROTC

courses “raises the question of why cadets can’t take
existing Arts and Sciences courses and get a military
emphasis in labs.”

English professor Donald Petesch agreed with O’Neil that
ROTC courses have changed, but maintained that the
program’s goals are the same as in the past.

“The political bias is still present,” Petesch said. “The
objectives of ROTC remained antithetical to those of the
University. ’ ’

“We overestimate the effect of our good will toward the
military,” Petesch added.

One of the few faculty members who spoke in favor of the
proposal, Peter Karsten of the history department, claimed

Five top editors of Newsweek
magazine addressed issues sur-
rounding the nation’s economy and
other national and world affairs at a
luncheon - panel discussion Tues-
day, sponsored by the world Affairs
Council of Pittsburgh at the William.
Penn Hotel, downtown.

Early discussion centered on the
progress, effectiveness and expect-
ations of the Carter administration

 this and the coming year.

“I’d give the ﬁfst year of the
Carter administration an “A” for
average,” said Newsweek chief
political correspondent Hal Bruno,

/.

“but this has been the case of the
first terms of many presidents.”

Bruno cited the lack of exper-
ience in international affairs as
being the major political problem of
the Carter administration.

Bruno added that there will have
to be a major reorganization
program instituted in the White
House and the Cabinet should
present style of administration
continue, and if Carter hopes to
avoid becoming a one-term presi-
dent.

Vice President Walter Mondale’s

inﬂuence on the workings of the
Carter administration was, for the

most part, applauded by the
members of the panel.

“Mondale has been much more
inﬂuential than past vicepresi-
dents,” Bruno said. “He has been
used to repair damage within the
party, but the only problem is that
he has been consulted after a move
was made instead of before.”

According to the panel the stock
market is in a depression and Peter
Kilborn, business editor of News-
week, attributed it to the number of
layoffs and mergers being reported
in industry.

“The feeling on Wall Street is
that the market is now within 10 to
15 points of its low and what we

Striking workers at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC) have asked for a statement
of support from the Student
Government Board.

Sam Magill, representing 120
WPIC psychiatric assistants, clerks,
dietary, maintenance and house-
keeping workers of the National
Union of Hospital and Health Care
Employees, presented the strikers’
case to "the board’ Wednesday
evening.

The workers, on the picket lines
since Feb. 17, are planning a rally
tomorrow afternoon at Western
Psych.

SGB president Josh Baylson said
the board would study the hospital's
strike before making any kind of
statement or commitment.

Also, at Wednesday’s meeting,
board members drafted a resolution

Kilbom said.

He also said before Wall Street

dollar must be propped up, an
accomplishment that can be made
only when the Carter administra-
tion indicates it will contain
inﬂation.

The Newsweek editors made
predictions for possible hopefuls in
the 1980 presidential campaign.

Hillman began closing last week
at 10:00 p.m. on weeknights in
compliance with a Public Utility
Commission order requiring a 25
percent cutback on electrical
consumption. “It was amazing to
me that they (the administration)
should choose mid-terms during

Baylson said.

Baylson suggested library offi-
cials keep the lights off during the
day, then close down the third and
fourth floors at night, thereby
cutting down on energy use and
permitting students to utilize the
first two ﬂoors for studying until one
a.m.

Sharon Starsynski said. _

said, “and if Jerry Brown wins the
California gubernatorial race he
will probably be right in there

On the Republican ticket for
President in 1980 Kilbom said that
there are several possibilities.

“John Connolly is very much in
the picture, as is Senator Robert

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

A Setback for note

To our surprise, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was rather em-
phatic Tuesday in its denial of CAS credit for courses in military
science, handing down a 63-30 decision that cannot be reversed by
the 25 absentee ballots yet to be counted.

ll ‘)C>n.

The margin of ROTC’s defeat in this week’s referendum is con-
siderably wider than was the case in 1975, when a similar proposal
was voted down 84-74. Despite an intensive effort by ROTC cadets
to legitimate their request for credit (last March they collected
2,500 signatures on a petition urging the reinstatement of credit,
which was revoked in 1968), it appears they are losing ground with
the faculty.

As should be clear from past editorials on this subject, we are not
disappointed by the outcome of Tuesday's voting. The proponents
of credit for ROTC have yet to come up with reasons for granting
their request that outweigh the objections articulated by the FAS.

Foremost among those objections, we think, is the fact that
ROTC course content is outside the control of the University. To
approve credit under such circumstances would probably not be in
the best interests of administrative and academic integrity within
CAS. ROTC courses may be of good quality right now (in military
terms), but the value of semi-civilian military training programs
tends to fluctuate—as evidenced by more than a few reserve
training units.

Lesser objections—lesser, but significant nonetheless—revolve
around such things as cost-benefit calculations, conflicting political
biases and ROTC program goals. ‘

Despite our opposition to ROTC accreditation, however, we find
considerable merit in Prof. Peter Karsten’s comments about the
value-orientation of ROTC-produced officers (as opposed to those
who graduate from service academies). It is quite probably a good
thing that most military officers come from what ‘is known in the
services as “the real world,” rather than from the elitist and
cloistered environments of Annapolis, West Point and Colorado
Springs. While we cannot support credit for ROTC, we are not en-
tirely sure it has no place on campus.

Letters to the Editor

When. The Lights Go Out At Hillman

I am sorry to see Americans being
put through so much trouble for the
sake of a few. I am not saying that I
support nor am I saying I oppose the
coal strike. As a result,
nonetheless, each of us must give
up something in order to conserve
electricity.

I can understand the University
administration when they want to
close buildings and turn out lights to
conserve this power, which in the
past has been wasted without a
thought.

But why is Hillman Library closed
earlier than other buildings—the
Cathedral, for example? Libraries
contain a wealth of information
which far exceeds the amount in any
other place of reference. It is

therefore an invaluable and integral
part of the community——especially a
university community. Not only
does the library house information
needed by students and professors
for research, but it also provides a
quiet, comfortable place to study.

Just like Hillman Library, the
Cathedral provides a place for
study, but not nearly as quiet and as
comfortable as Hillman. And, as far
as I know, administrative ofﬁces
close at 4:30 or 5:00 p.m.

Why isn’t the Cathedral
closed, locked up, and shut down
before Hillman- Library? I am very
much dissatisﬁed with the Chancel-
lor’s decision to close the library at
earlier times. .1 personally am

insulted that Hillman is closed even
two hours earlier, for every minute
spent there is precious. For many
students,
Hillman is more conducive to study
than the single or double units of the
Towers or the rooms of the Quad.

To add injury to insult, the
Cathedral lawn is illuminated by
those abominable, intense ﬂood-
lights near the top of that
quasi-Gothic structure. If turning
out those lights would keep Hillman
Library open for only ﬁve additional
minutes, I would be satisfied.

Or is the Cathedral of Learning
truly the Height of Ignorance.

The determination of Vanderbilt
University's administration to host
the South Africa-United States
Davis Cup tennis match has turned
the Nashville. Tenn., institution
into a political and racial time
bomb.

At the heart of the controversy is
apartheid-—the vicious, morally
repugnant racial policy of the
Government of South Africa. At
stake is the freedom of an athlete to

philosophies. This freedom must
be maintained, for if it is not, the
liberty of athletes. musicians,
artists and writers is seriously
threatened.

Vanderbilt agreed to host the
Davis Cup zone ﬁnal to be held
later this month. As it turned out,
the United Sates and South Africa

will compete. But there are
protesters who believe that by
showcasing the tennis match.

Vanderbilt is endorsing apartheid.

realize one can’t ﬁght political
reality — apartheid — with sports
symbolism.

A petition signed by supporter of
the Vanderbilt administration's
free-speech, open-forum policy
states, “The folly of mixing politics
and athletes would seem to be
self-evident. Those who protest
the tennis matches assert that the
principle does not apply because
questioning and debate cannot take
place. If they were right. then a
Russian ballet company or a
musician from Cuba would fall in
the same category." That folly
apparently is not as self-evident as
many would wish. It seems too
many people are looking out onto
the tennis court and seeing South
African Prime Minister John
Vorster in short pants, and a
headband.

Sport and politics. linked only by
world leaders whose sport is
politics, must remain apart. And.
in theory. there is no more
apolitical sporting event than the
Davis Cup. Athletes represent
theircountry. and try to bring some
kind of honor to it. Diplomatic
feuds are ‘forgotten.

and the I

possibility of persuasive force
never is considered. Athletes play
their simple games, and people
watch them to forget about politics
and other problems, not to relive
them.

To suggest the white South
African tennis players must share
the beliefs of their Government is
to deny them freedom of expres-
sion and freedom (and sometimes
responsibility) to dissent. At least
one, Ray Moore, has bee denounc-
ing apartheid for years. He quit
the South African team this week in
protest of the continuing political
hagglings. He just wants to play
tennis.

To deny these players their
freedoms of expression and dissent
is to emplov the same tactics as the
South African Government's apart-
heid policy. To strip people of
their basic rights because they are
black in South Africa is no different
than denying people their basic
rights because they are South
African in Tennessee. This is not
to suggest that the protest against
South African competitors appear-
ing at Vanderbilt is as obscene or
degrading as what is occurring in
South Africa. Still, the difference
is only a matter of degree.

Less than 10 percent of the
Russian population is actually
Communist. Although Commun-
ism is considered an evil in the
American value system. we permit
Russian visitors. including ath-
letes. to play and perform in our
country. How many people
protested when the United States
and China held table tennis
matches?

We applaud the athletic grace
and aesthetic beauty of Olga
Korbut, but bitterly try to deny
South African tennis players the
right to represent their country, the
right to be unashamed to be South
African and the privilege to
compete with our world-class
athletes.

The protesters are going after
the wrong targets. South African

embassies and consulates—staffeil}.

by official political representative‘ A
of the South African Government
and its policies—are given less
attention than Vanderbilt Univer-
sity. Corporations benefitting from
apartheid are not being given the
attention they deserve. If the
United States supports countries
that support South Africa, demand
the support be discontinued. Fight
political action with political action.
Leave sport out of the ﬁghting. It
deserves to remain above the
squabblings.

On the subject of international
politics, the issue of the unrest and
peace talks in the Middle East was
raised.

“The problem in America in
relation to the talks in the Middle
East is that we have the euphoric
idea that the problem should be
resolved in ‘three weeks or three
months. There will be a settlement
but it will be a long, drawn-out

ROTC Credit
Defeated By

(Continuedfrom Page 1)

“ROTC students have demon-
strably different values than do
other soldiers, and it is important to
attract such people to this
program."

Other faculty members said they
opposed the resolution because of
military indoctrination, the “men-
ace of militarism,” and ROTC’s
“threat to the University's in-
tegrity.”

After the defeat of the proposal,
Air Force cadet Scott Wagner, who
helped organize ROTC’s effort to
regain credit, said he was
“disappointed and disgusted."

“Many of the faculty were
open-minded. They had their
minds already made up and they
wouldn’t listen to our arguments,”
Wagner said.

“The evidence they used was
beside the point. It scares me to
know that some faculty members
must resort to such emotional
arguments on this question,”
Wagner continued. “It scares me,
but we’re not giving up.”

Cut, Print It--Film Developing In Oakland

By DAVE McDONALD
PiIl_fjews Staff Writer
To remember the best times of your life at Pitt,
you may want to capture them in pictures.

There are ﬁve stores near the University that
develop the popular Instamatic 110 or 35 mm ﬁlm:
Foto Hut, 3711 Forbes Ave., Gils, Forbes Ave., Photo
Corral, the corner of Forbes Ave. and Bouquet St.,
and Sun Drug and Thrift Drug, on opposite sides of
Atwood Street along Forbes Ave.

The price of developing the ﬁlm, the time involved,
and , the quality of the pictures are important
considerations when choosing a store. i

More people may run to Sun to have pictures
developed, for it seems to offer the best deal. Sun has
the lowest prices for developing 35 mm color ﬁlm:
$4.19 for 20 prints and $6.59 for 36 prints. The
Instamatic 110 pictures also are priced cheaply at Sun:
$2.99 for 12 color prints and $4.19 for 20. The Sun
pricing policy is $1.19 for developing and 15 cents per
print Sun also offers a refund for any pictures that
don t come out. The only drawback is that it takes a
little longer to get the pictures back at Sun, usually

about a week.

If you are in a hurry to get your pictures back, the
place to go in Oakland is Foto Hut. Be prepared to pay
much higher prices, however. Foto Hut boasts a
24-hour developing service; if it receives ﬁlm in the
morning, it usually returns the pictures the next day.
Its steeper‘ prices Include: $4.01 for 12 110 color

prints; $5.85 for 20 110 color prints and 20 35mm color
prints; $9.53 for 36 35 mm color prints.

Photo Corral, which does the largest amount of ﬁlm
processing in Oakland, has prices between those of
Sun and Foto Hut. Photo Corral charges $1.25 for
processing and 19 cents per print. So 12 110 color
prints cost $3.53; 20 110 color prints cost $5.05, as do
20 35 mm color prints; 36 35 mm color prints cost
$8.09. The color processing at Photo Corral usually
takes two or three days.

Camera buffs with Instamatics may ﬁnd Gil’s the
place for developing their ﬁlm. Gil’s sends the ﬁlm it
receives to Perfection Photo in Greensburg; the
developed ﬁlm comes back in three or four days. Gil’s
prices are the lowest for 110 ﬁlm; 12 color prints for
$2.79 and 20 for $3.99. For the 35 mm color prints,
Gil’s prices are in the middle range; 20 pictures cost
$4.79 and 36 cost $7.83.

Thrift Drug has prices in step with those of Sun, and
also takes a week for developing. It’s prices for 36.35
mm color prints is the only one higher than
Sun’s——$7.30.

A Sun Drug has a “no fault” refund on ﬁlm, and
Photo Corral develops two 5’ ‘X7’ ’ or one 8’ ’X10” color
enlargements free for every 10 rolls of ﬁlm.

Editor’s Note: Next week’s Consumer Comer will
discuss dry cleaning businesses in the University
area. Any reader with Consumer Comer topics can

Irish Band Makes Men}; With Ethnic Music

By TERRI vocr

Music to some means a ﬂick of a
radio switch to an overbearing disco
beat, but, to Devilish Merry, it
means respect. The ﬁve-member
group plays traditional Irish tunes
that touch the roots of the musician,
and tell stories to listeners.

Larry Edelman, guitar and

Merry combines fiddle tunes, Irish
dance, New England and Scottish
songs and Appalachian mountain
tunes. ‘ ‘We develop our own music
from these cultural roots,” Edel-
man said.

Banjo player Sue Powers said she
“feels devotion” to ethnic music
because “it is so old, and it is also
what I was brought up on, back in

Not unlike jazz musicians,
Devilish Merry sometimes jams,
sending its audience into a frenzy of
Irish jigs and down-home foot-
stomping.

“Music is a form of communica-
tion,” said Larry McCullough, a
graduate student in ethnomusicol-

ogy at Pitt who sings, plays the tin‘

whistle (a traditional Irish instru-

mandolin player, said Devilish

ment), the wooden flute and the
bodhran (an Irish drum).

Jan Hamilton, who plays the
ﬁddle, has been with Devilish
Merry since last fall. “The only
difference between a violin and a
ﬁddle is the way it is played.” Sald
Hamilton, a violin instructor by day.

Rounding out the band is Burr

dulcimer player. The dulcimer is

By MARTHA GARVEY

Pitthievxstaffwriter

Dear Seth,

I guess I should get the most
obvious cliches out of the ways ﬁrst:
Is it really eight years since I've
seen you? V

You know of course, that you will
be forever 18 in my mind. Istill see
you in the arts and crafts center
where we both worked. You were a
long-haired, long-legged tree.
There were always at least three
children clutching your ankles. You
were always playing your guitar,
trying to quiet all that energy
seething at your feet.

You were perfect. I was 12. You
were 18—an age I believed I’d
never reach. You had a hairy chest,
a big nose, and kids adored you. All
of this love, of course, Ikept a secret
from you——or so I believed. I only
hung around you every spare
moment I had.

But you had an imperfection, and
even 1, your biggest fan, noticed it.

It was 1970. All the songs you sang .

seemed to revolve around war,
dying, young men ﬁghting or not

“ﬁghting. I told you how boring you

were becoming.

 

“I’m sorry,” you said, “it’s the
war. And, you know, I’m 18.”

Just as I can't imagine you now,
26, perhaps married, with your own
children at your feet, I couldn’t
imagine you then, in a war. What
would you do with the little kids who
like to swing from your shoulders?
How could you pack a guitar in a
knapsack? So I tried very hard not
to think about it.

Your body, though, had a
blessed ﬂaw. Your back was not
quiet right. So you went to college,
but not to war.

All my memories of the war are

like my memory of you—second-I

and-third-hand memories, stories
told by older people, mostly people
who didn’t or wouldn’t go.

I want to tell you about his play I
saw. It was called “Medal of Honor
Rag.” The play was about a man
who didn’t have your ﬂawed back,
a man who went to war. The man
was black-like most of the kids we
tried to teach. He won a
Congressional Medal of Honor, he
returned to Detroit safely and his
family was glad to see him. But he
couldn’t cope. All his friends had
been killed, just as his heart and
his mind had been killed.

pm. -

The man in the play is in an
Army hospital. A psychiatrist visits
him and fails to rescue him from his
private inferno. The man is killed
(or kills himself) while robbing a
grocery store.

But the last memory, the last
image, is not of a dead veteran, but
of a troubled psychiatrist, who
knows that he must share the
responsibility, for the veteran’s
death.

I cried a lot at the play. The tears
were, I admit, mostly self-
congratulatory, like crying at a
movie so that a boy you like will
notice you. But no one in the
theater noticed. I guessed it was
because each person was living his
own private Vietnam. My Vietnam
was marching and raising money
for Dick Hughes; my Vietnam was
seeing myself on TV, holding a
sign. My Vietnam was you.

A lot of the people at the theater
talked about how “we” have
learned from the war. Some people
talked about how the play really
wasn’t about the Vietnam War. It
didn’t matter which war——the play
was a good play because it was
universal. I see their point——10
years from now the play will stand,
both as a document and as a work
of art. People for whom the word
Vietnam carries no memories will
be moved by the play.

I’m writing to you to ask you.
Seth, have “we” learned from
Vietnam? Who are “we?” It
mattered very much to you that the
war you were being asked to ﬁght

was the Vietnam War. Does the
universality of this play bother you
at all?

Who are “we:” The “we” in the
theater said they had learned from
Vietnam—the play proved it,
proved that we look at war
differently now, that it could never
happen again.

I know how badly I want to
believe that. It's selﬁsh, just as the
tears were selﬁsh. I have no wish to
calculate as I once had to, which of

my friends, lovers, brothers will
survive.

But I want to tell you about

another “we.” I work on The Pitt
News, the student newspaper. One
night, I was watching someone
type a headline for an opinion
'column on the Tet offensive.
,- The National Liberation Force of
‘North Vietnam attacked every
important American base, city and
town of South Vietnam. It was a
turning point, the writer said. The
war became real, monstrous—to
the media, and to the people in the
United States. Tet ignited the
peace movement and extinguished
Lyndon Johnson.

But we were just typing up the
headline. The guy who pastes up
the newspaper was worried. “How
do you spell Tet?” he asked. “Is it
a place or an organization?”

It‘ is a small detail. I wonder,
though, how he—who is my
age—can learn from a war he does
not remember, spelling words he
does not know the meaning of. He

Amnesia and Arrogance Plague Play

doesn’t know why I laughed as I
spelled it for him, just as I didn’t
understand why you had to keep
singing those boring songs about
not wanting to die.

Dear Seth, how do I make the
paste-up guy remember?

I should, of course, be writing to
you to impress you with my mind. I
should impress you, tell you how
you inspired me to political action,
to intellectual rigor.

But I can’t. Instead, I have these
two images in my head. One of
people in a theater hugging their
fur coats and smoothing their suits,
explaining that the country has
learned from a war—a war these
people mostly supported. The other
image is a man, 18, maybe a little
older, asking me to spell a word. I
cried in one place and laughed in
the other. Is there something
wrong with this picture?

I hope you are well.

Fondly,
Martha.

Second Season Bombs

There was a time when the major
networks started their evening
programming at 7:30 p.m., and had
enough regular programs to avoid
notorious space ﬁllers such as
specials, made-for-television mo-
vies and mini-series.

In 1973, the evening broadcasts
shifted to 8 p.m., with syndicated
shows (mostly variety and game
shows) selected by local stations
plugged in the half-hour void. Two
years later, a made-for-television
movie blossomed into the ﬁrst
mini-series—a six-hour extrava-
ganza called “QB-7.” From this
came “Rich Man, Poor Man” (both
books), “Roots” and “Captains
and the Kings.” All quality
entertainment, but made-for-tele-
vision movies have been going
downhill steadily.

Specials used to be exactly what
the name implies—rare occasions,
with stars like Frank Sinatra doing
excellent material. Somewhere
along the line, specials became
ﬁller, and everyone on the tube,
from Goldie Hawn to Mary Tyler
Moor to Barry Manilow to Chuck
Barris was appearing in a special.
Not that some of these acts aren’t
good—but specials used to happen
once a month, and now there are an
average of two per week per
network. There must be a lapse in

quality somewhere along the line. '

If there are enough actors and
singers eager to appear in

mini-series and specials as their
number indicates, if there are
enough skits written to fill
hour-and-a-half specials, there
must be enough material for some
regular televison series, instead of
these short space killing shots.

Last week, CBS ran a 90-minute
special on “The Jeffersons.” A
-ﬂimsy plot provided a chance to
inject endless ﬂashbacks. If the
show were something of conse-
quence (“All in The Family,” a
genuine trendsetter, merited an
hour’s worth of the same treatment
two years ago) the special might
have been deserved, but “The
J effersons, ” despite the very funny
Sherman Helmsley, is a pedestrian
show.

Running this monotonous fare
and labeling it as special is a grave
error—the time might be better
spent by running prospective pilots
for new shows (another space
killer), trying out bona‘ ﬁde new
series or adding a prime-time news
magazine show.

If the networks are so anxious to
ﬁll time with movies, why not
eliminate those insipid made-for-
television movies (that all star
Barbara Eden) and bring back
vintage films with Hepburn and
Tracy, Bogart and others. In terms
of cost, it would be a lot cheaper; in
terms of quality, the only advant-
age the new movies have is
technicolor.

Intense Piﬂ Prevail

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich’s
crash course in how to play
intense basketball down
through the stretch declared
dividends last night when the
Panthers hung on to defeat
George Washington, 85-83, at
the Civic Arena in the first
round of the Eastern Eight
tournament.

After losing the last game of
the regular season to
Massachusetts in a manner that
was becoming alarmingly
common for the Panthers, Pitt
(16-10) seized the lead in the
game’s final five minutes and
hung on by the skin of its claws
to advance to tonight’s
semifinal round (7 p.m. against
Villanova).

Pitt didn’t score a field goal
in the final 2:36 of the game,
but converted nine of 10 critical
free throws down the stretch.

The Panthers took the lead
after two minutes were gone in
the first half, 6-4, on a Larry
Harris special (a 20-foot
jumper) and held it for some 21
minutes. Ed Scheuermann

' picked up where he had left off

in his last Arena appearance
(against Maryland), hitting his
first three shots and playing
aggressively on both ends of the
floor.

George Washington took a
page out of the Jack Leamon
handbook and went to a full-
court press with 12 minutes
remaining in the half. At its
best, the press gave the
Colonials a couple of easy
baskets, but for the most part
all it did was test the player's
respiratory systems.

Eight points from Harris over
a three-minute period put Pitt
up by seven, and Colonial
coach Bob Tallent decided a
timeout might cool the 6-7
senior’s sizzling right wrist.

George Washington returned

Pitt’s basketball Panthers
may have learned their end-of-
the-game lessons well enough
to defeat their opponents. but
they apparently did not pass
last night’s test with George
Washington with a mark high
enough to satisfy coach Tim
Grgurich, who made hasty
reservations for his players at
Oakland’s Crossgates Inn, The
Pitt News learned last night.

Before the two-point win
against the Colonials last night,
Pitt had not planned to house
its players in the seclusion of a
hotel.

 

from the bench refreshed and
responded with two quick
hoops, but Pitt battled back and
with 1:57 left in the half the
Panthers held their biggest lead
of the night, 37-28.

Throughout the season, the
last few minutes of each half
have proved to be the Panthers’
nemesis; last night was no
exception. A turnover, an
airball by Pete Strickland and a
defensive breakdown added up
to six quick Colonial points,
and the lead was whittled to
three, 37-34, at intermission.

The Colonials were not
discouraged by the relative
ineffectiveness of their press in
the first half, as Tallent had
George Washington in a zone
press after every hoop to open
the half.

The Panthers went three
minutes without a score early in
the half; the Colonials ran off
nine unanswered points to take
the lead for the first time since
the early moments of the game,
45-43.

Everything that Scheuer-
mann touched in the first half
turned to gold, but in the
second half he was anything but

shots and had a fifth batted_out

Strickland. inserted into the
game to combat the press and
tendency to stand around, hit a
long jumper to cap a six-point
Panther burst and Pitt was up
by three. 54-51.

Les Anderson took over from
there. hitting three quick hoops
in a manner that made one
wonder what bank in the city
could be open at such a late
hour. The Colonials were
scoring their points in bunches
in the second half, but were
also giving them up in much the
same manner, and the result
was that the spread grew no
larger than five for the rest of

the game.
With a little better than six
minutes left in the game,

Strickland began to work his
magic, hitting two long jumpers
and running the fast break the
way it is done in Grgurich’s
dreams, and Tallent decided it
was time for another little chat.

The game then boiled down
to Pitt-’s ability to hit the clutch
free throws versus Mike
Glenn’s ability to score at will
underneath the basket, but as
any high school coach will
attest, there is no “I” in the
word team, and the Panthers
prevailed, 85-83.

scorer with 25 points (bringing

Before the Eastern
tournament’s pair
doubleheaders at the Civic
Arena yesterday, the most
noteworthy item John Cinicola
and Joedy Gardner had in
common was that each coach
was said to be eyeing an axe
whose proximity made it dif-
ficult to focus.

But each was rewarded with
another night’s work by his
players yesterday, and
Cinicola’s Duquesne Dukes will

his career total to 1.888), ad-
ding seven rebounds. five
assists and four steals. Although
Pitt was outrebounded, 41-35,
Clancy took individual honors
grabbing 11 to go along with 17
points that included two free
throws in the final 21 seconds.

“We came in today thinking
that if we played hard and
stayed away from mistakes at
the end of the game, we would
win,” Harris said. “If we don’t
make a lot of mistakes, we can
beat anybody in the country.”

Strickland continued his role
of supersub, scoring eight
points (four of six shooting) and
adding seven assists in less than
one half of playing time.

Anderson’s torrid second half
had him believing he could
move mountains, even Mt.
Clancy. The shoving match that
ensued did nothing but light a
fire under Clancy and-have the
crowd of 7,865 question
Anderson’s ability to reason.

“Sam Clancy was the dif-
ference in the ballgame,”
Tallent said. “He did some
things at the end of the game
that hurt us and really picked
them (Pitt) up.”

“I guess I get a lot of folks
scared ‘cause I’m so big,”
Clancy said, “but he (Anderson)
thought he could take me."

That proved to be Ander-
son’s (and George
Washington’s) fatal mistake.

however, maintained an air of

report card places it in the third

“What job situation?” he
replied to the question that
sought to link his team’s

“All I know is, right now we’re

What Cinicola is waiting to

WVU Upsets Knights

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Eighth-seeded West Virginia.
throughout the regular season a
team whose two stars were
dimmed by their teammates’
ineffectiveness, got help from
each of its starters yesterday,
and the Mountaineers
eliminated tournament favorite
Rutgers, 81-74, in the 3 p.m.
game.

Each WVU starter con-
tributed to an effort that kept
the Mounties in the lead much
of the game, though Maurice
Robinson’s 14 rebounds and
Lowes Moore’s 18 second-half

points did nothing to damage
their reputation as the
Mountaineers’ main men.

“My reaction now,” WVU
coach Joedy Gardner said some
10 minutes after the game. “is
the same as it was in the locker
room right after the game —— we
stuck to our game plan and
made no adjustments. And we
won.”

The Mountaineer win caused
Gardner’s coaching coun-
terparts in the league to adjust
substantially their tournament
strategy, which must have been
win until it came time to play
Rutgers, and then hope James

Bailey grew weary of slammin
alley-oop passes through the
rim.

“They were the team that had
to be beaten,” said Gardner. “If
you don’t believe me, ask the
other six coaches . . . ask them
how they feel.”

Bailey. the 6-9 Rutgers junior
who brought a season’s total
106 slam dunks to Pittsburgh,
hit 15 of 23 shots from the field
and paced Scarlet scorers with
a tournament-record 34 points.
Hollis Copeland (14 points) was

the only other member of.

Rutgers’ fabulous front line to
score in double figures.

Villanova Earns Remafch

Villanova’s Wildcats earned
a rematch with Pitt by defeating
Penn State, 73-65, putting Keith
Herron in position to become
the school’s ‘leading career
scorer.

Herron, whose 18 paced the
Wildcats yesterday, needs 14

Villanova’s all-time list.

Pitt defeated Villanova by 16
points, 97-81, at the Field
House three weeks ago, but Pitt
coach Tim Grgurich said he
expects a closer contest
tonight. “We match up well

with them,” he said.

That balance could be upset
if Herron’s injured knee, which
dampened his effectiveness
against Penn State, continues to
trouble him. “It's weak,”
Wildcat coach Rollie
Massimino said of his star’s
knee. “I just hope it holds up.”

Are Panther stalwarts Enough For EWL Toumament?

By JIM LEWIS

Pill News Staff Writer
The Pitt wrestling team goes into
the Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) Tournament at Bloomsburg
with 134-pound All-Afnerica Rande

- Stottlemyer, 190-pound senior Bill

Bailey, and heavyweight senior
Mark Stepanovich almost sure to
qualify for the NCAA National
Tournament. But is that enough for
the Panthers to challenge seriously
for the team title?

“We’ll have our winners,” Pitt
head coach Dave Adams said. “But
things will depend on how we do in
the consolations. We'll have to
have both, but I think the consola-
tions will determine the winner.”

The top two wrestlers of each
weight class, plus three wild-card
wrestlers chosen by the coaches,
will represent the seven-team
league. Pitt (ranked 18th) should
challenge last year’s champion-
13th-rganked Penn State—-for the
team honors, along with 19th-
ranked Cleveland State, Clarion and
Bloomsburg. Lock Haven (14-6),
with an 0-4 league record and West
Virginia (7-11), with an; 0-1 league
mark, should bring up the rear.

Here is how each weight class
should shape up for the Panthers:

118—Pitt’s Glen ’ Maxwell, a

freshman, sported a 5-1 record
against league competition. His
only loss was to probable top-seed
Mike DeAugustino of Penn State-
a lopsided 11-0 affair; Otherwise,
the rest of the ﬁeld is fairly even,
with Clarion’s Jan Clark and

\ Cleveland State’s Phil Drenik the

strongest challengers. Maxwell
decisioned Clark in Pitt’s 31-9
victory over the Golden Eagles
earlier this season, 12-6. He never
has met Drenik, however.

126——The Nitanny Lions’ fresh-
man sensation Scott DeAugustino,
who whipped Panther Jose Martin-
ez, 10-4, in a28-11 PSU victory, may
not participate due to a rib injury
incurred against Syracuse two
weeks ago. If he misses the event,
and is replaced by junior Joe Frantz,
the weight title is up for grabs.
Cleveland State’s John Reid (2-0)
and Bloomsburg’s Tom Fink (1-0-1)
will be likely to get the edge over
Pitt’s Martinez(3-2-1), with Clar-
ion’s Tom Diamond (2-2, including
a 10-4 loss to Martinez) providing
one of the closest ﬁelds in the
tournament.

134—If Stottlemyer’s ankle in-
jury, acquired in Pitt’s 34-13 win
over Ohio State, is healed enough
for him to wrestle, he will qualify.

Stottlemyer, who became the

Panthers’ all-time individual-record
champion against the Buckeyes,
will face competition from Blooms-
burg’s Carl Poff, but the rest of the
ﬁeld is made up of wrestlers he’s
already beaten. Poff, Clarion’s
Randy Miller and Cleveland State’s
Bill Walsh will ﬁght for second
place, but Stottlemyer (6-0) should
breeze—if his ankle holds up.
142-—Panther freshman sub
Steve Gouletas has two wins in ﬁve
matches this year—but both are
against EWL competition, and he
has a chance to be seeded in the
tournament. A decision over
Cleveland State’s Greg Drenik and
a pin against West Virginia’s Rod
Johnson put him behind Lock
Haven’s Mike Moore (4-0) as far as
league record is concerned. But
Moore is a returning champion, and
with Duane Powlus (1-0) and Penn
State’s Geoff Brodhead (2-2)
challenging, there will be a
four-way battle for first.
150—With starter Ed Bredniak
out with a shoulder injury until next
season, Pitt is busy deciding
between freshman Mike Bond (0-1)
or junior Mark Popiolkowski (0-1) as
its representative. The wrestler
chosen will have to battle PSU’s Bill
Vollrath (4-0) and Clarion’s Ron
Standridge (1-0) for the right to

qualify. The Mountaineers’ Mickey
McDonald (1-O) decisioned Popiol-
kowski, 8-5, and may be a slight
threat to second-place hopefuls.
1S8—Panther freshman Tom
Jones (1-5) will have to work if he
has thoughts of qualifying. The
Lions’ Dave Becker, who crushed
Jones, 17-4, will ﬁght Bloomsburg’s
Chris Poff (1-0), Clarion’s Dale
Gilbert and Lock Haven’s Doug

. Gallagher for title honors.

167—Pitt’s Jim Gordon (3-2) will
face tough competition in Cleveland
State’s Ron Varga, Bloomsburg’s
Andy Cappelli and Penn State’s
Ashley Swift. All three have beaten
Gordon at one time or another this
season.

177—Panther senior George
0’Korn (1-2) qualified for the
NCAA’s two years ago, but will
really have to work to repeat. Dom
DiGioacchino of Bloomsburg is the
early favorite, with Cleveland
State’s Les‘ Steidl and PSU’s Dan
Pfautz right behind.

190-—S'enior Bill Bailey needs 3
only three more wins to move him’

into second place in all-time
individual wins, behind Stottlem-
yer. With a 6-0 league record, he
should be inspired. Cleveland
State’s Jack Vanadia and Penn

State’s Sam Sallitt are the only real
challengers.

HWT—Panther Mark Stepano-
vich’s trouble will be with
Bloomsburg’s Mel Sharp, Clarion’s
Jack Campbell and Cleveland
State’s Tim Payne. Payne probably
will challenge Stepanovich the
most—the Pitt heavyweight deci-
sioned him, 6-2, to help the
Panthers to a 22-18 upset earlier
this year. Stepanovich, unless he
falters, should qualify. ’

There is a lot of good competition
this season, and Pitt has a chance to
be on top of it.

“I wouldn’t take the chance of
qualifying away from anybody,”
Adams said. ‘ ‘But I don’t know who
will win the team title. It could turn
into a ﬁve-team race—Penn State,
Cleveland State, Clarion—I don’t
know.”

Ponfhereﬂe Hoopsfers Grab EAIAW Bid

By MARY S. HUZINEC

Pin News Staff Writer

At the beginning of the
Pantherette basketball season,
coach. Jean Balthaser said her goal
was to receive a post-season playoff
bid for the third straight year.

Her wish was granted Sunday
night, as Pitt learned it had received
a spot in the opening round of the
EAIAW (Eastern Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wo-
men) satellite tournament at
Edinboro State College.

Tonight at 6 p.m. Pitt faces
Immaculata College, a team that
beat the Pantherettes Monday
night, 82-75.

“The girls know Immaculata is
beatable,” Balthaser said. “We
played them the way we wanted to
on Monday night, but. some of their
shooters were too hot. Since we’ll
be playing them twice in the same
week, they’ll be fresh in our
minds.” _

Balthaser said the Pantherettes

will concentrate on keeping 6-3 '

center Wanda Randolph (who had
28 points Monday) out of foul
trouble, and on getting the ball
inside to her. They’ll also try to

keep the ball away from Immacu-. ‘

lata’s 6-1 forward,-Denise Burdick,.
who scored 25 points Monday.

“Wanda played an outstanding
game,” Balthaser said. “Immacu-

her in the game tonight, we’ll be in

Monday, Pitt went into the game
"hoping to stop Burdick and 6-4

surprised by the high-percentage
shooting of Immaculata’s guards.
Immaculata was 13-17' from the
floor in the first half. At halftime,’
the Pantherettes trailed by 13.

In the second half, Pitt drew
closer, but couldn’t get close
enough.

“It seemed like everytime we
came within nine, they’d take it
back out to 13,” Balthaser said.

At the 11-minute mark, the
Pantherettes forced some turnovers
and were up by one, but failed to
score on four consecutive posses-
sions.

“That was our opportunity to
break the game open,” Balthaser
said, ‘ ‘but we didn’t take advantage
of it.” , V '

The Pantherettes also failed to
capitalize on Miller’s four early
fouls. The 6-4 center didn’t foul out

‘ The Pantherette track and, field
squad will take to the road for the
ﬁrst time this year when it competes
in an invitational meet at East
Stroudsburg.

The ﬁeld will consist of nine
teams including Rutgers, Delaware
State. La Salle, Temple. Villanova,
St. John’s and Maryland.

According to Pitt coach Alfreeda
Goff, this meet will give the
Pantherettes a chance to see some

Friday, March 3, l978—THE PITT NEWS-Page 11

Pitt Preps for l-'lrst Road Meet

of the teams they will compete
against at the Eastern Champion-
ship, such as Rutgers and St.
.Iohn’s.

Two excellent competitors in the
meet will be Sharon Redvict of
Delaware State and Maryland's
Paula Girven. At the Pitt
Invitational earlier this year,
Redvict broke the Pitt Field House
and Invitational records in the
shot-put with a put of 44 feet 4‘/2
inches. Girven tied her own Field
House and Invitational records in
the high jump with a jump of 5-8.

Girven will have keen competition
in the form of Pitt’s Marie Ribik,
who also holds the 5-8 record.

Rutgers boasts a good mile-relay
team and, according to Coach Goff,
“St. John’s has some outstanding
girls.”

Since the women haven’t com-
peted off of their own track. this
meet will give them a chance to
warm up for the Eastern Cham-
pionships next week at Tufts
College. ‘

The entire team will make the
trip, and 24 Pantherettes will
compete. “The girls are really
looking forward to the trip,” said
Goff.

Since the Eastern Champion-
ships are coming up next week,
Goff said she hopes the team isn’t
looking ahead.

“We’re in good shape health-
wise, and are looking for a good
meet,” said Goff. “We hope to
peak for the Championships next
week.”
