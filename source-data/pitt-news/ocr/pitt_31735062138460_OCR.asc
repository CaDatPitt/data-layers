co-captained the basketball team this year and led the city in scoring, is playing football for 

the~ﬁr‘st time although you’d never suspect this t‘act.from his actions on the ﬁeld.

He can catch just a_bout,anything "thrown and has Doctor Carlson's endorsement to:
the effect that he will score -ten touchdowns personally this yea1'. However, _a knee injury’.
may keep him on the sidelines. ' _  _ h :

Mal Ebert, 230 pound freshman prospect froni Erie, Pa., and Marty Rosepink willtea'm« ‘
up attackle. Ebert ,who is almost the immovable object in his position, has only been
ticing with the team since September 1. '

Tackle Rosepink has been’in—
yolved in more shifts than a 24 hour
defense woker. A member of last
'year’s team, Rosepink had always
played end. The summer practice

session revealed a need for centers .

‘and Rosepink was draftecl for the
job. But he had only been out two
Weeks when he contnacted a bad
case of sunburn poisoning. He
did not return until the opening
of the fall practice sessions. By
then, he had missed so much that he
stood only to be .a second stringer
at the center spot. Meantime, the
tackle situation had become mildly
desperate. “Would Rosepink prefer
to be a second string center or a
first string tackle?” Rosey agreed
to do what was best for the team—4
shift over to tackle. ‘ -

Teaming up’. with Fran Mattioli
at’ guard will be Gary Feniello, a
freshman from Connellsville. How-
ever, Steve Polach a- scrappy 165
pounder from Uniontown; may still
beat him out for the starting berth.

Centering ‘for the Panthers will
either be Don Fisher « or Ralph
Hammond; Hammond earned his
letter at_Pitt in 1941 as a quarter-
back, but agreed to shift to center
when that spot was vacated by
Rosepink. - .

Starting quarterback -for Pitt
will be Joe Mocha, a smart little
ball handler from St. Clair, Pa.
Mocha, who ‘ weighs only 165
pounds. is 17. _ ,

The backﬁeld will be made up of
Frank Knisley at left half, Bill
Abromitis at fullback, and Lou
Chelko at right half‘. Knisley had,
some ex;pe_rience-. on the freshnian
teain last seascm. and Chelko ear__ned_
his letter on the var>:it_V.‘ Abrmnitis
is a 190 pound :t're.~=hman troni Ta-
maqua, Pa. He is a good passer and
a good kicker. - ‘

from the start. but even they have

been ifeluctzvntly forced to admit.

‘That is typically American.

‘;.gMillions of Americans are living by that creed.

é.rro'1pS, Americans of recent for;
rfgn extraction who have been co-
operating with tile university in
our nationality‘ rooms and other
programs. Then, Pittsburgh it-
seld has =2 7-”-rge foreign popula-
lation which can be extremely
helpful, because it can throw light
on situations our men will meet
on foreign soil.’-’

Men in this new unit, which is the
Civil Affairs Training School of the
Office of the Provost Marshall Gen-
eral, are specialists in certain ﬁelds.
In civil life they were leaders in
occupations of immense importance
in the job they will do abroad. They
have all been selected on the basis
of past performance. Most of them
have had a month of intensive train-
ing at Fort Custer, Michigan.

These men who are captains,
majors, and colonels have 30 hours
of classroom instruction at the
Pitt school. Fifteen hours are de-
voted to the study of languages.
Even their lunch hour is given
over to conversation in the lan-
guages they are studying.

Col. James F. Corn is in charge
of their military instruction. He has
been connected with the Office of
Provost Marshall General for one
year and is a graduate of Charlot-
tesville, and also of the British
School of Military Government.

Recitals Start Monday

Organ recitals, presented each
semester to the Pitt student body
and faculty by Mr. F. Lotz, Uni-
versity organist, will begin next
Monday in Heinz Chapel. Mr, Lotz
will be at the organ from 1 to 1:30
o'clock. . _

Monday’s program will include
selections from Bach, Hyden, De
Bussy, and Franc.

The recitals will be held each
Weekday, Mondays through Fridays,
throughout the semester. The facul-
ty and student body are invited to
attend.

Nazi Propaganda
Copy OF U. S.

Theodore W. Biddle, Dean of
Men, received an authentic piece of
Nazi propaganda in a recent let-
ter from Ensign Edward L. Ray-
mond, Bus. Ad.42. The writing
which is in Italian, is printed on the
back of a paper that represents an
American ten dollar bill. The face

of a bill, although a poor copy on‘

close inspection, looks like legal
tender. When the bill is turned over,
these paragraphs, as translated in
Ens. Raymond’s letter, appear:
“The American dollar has al-
ways been a “prized” money.
That in consequence of the im-
mense natural wealth that Amer-
ica possesses and which in large
part has been given value by the
tenacious work of the Italian im-

“The United States of America
had no right to intervene in the
European conflict. American in-
tervention, which history must
condemn, was determined by the
sole desire to extend the economic
dominion of North America to the
continent of Europe and in Africa.

“How many American citizens’;
of Italian origin are now forced to .
ﬁght (against) their motherland.
in which “repose” their parents
and their ancestors!?.” _ .

Ens. Raymond, who Was the ver-
satile “Lefty” Ziolkowski of the
Pitt basketball team, picked up the
propaganda bill in Sicily, where he
took an active part in the D-day
attack.

promises to be a wide open, free

with passes.

Pitt holdsithe edge in the 11 game
Pitt-Notre Dame series to date with

' ‘ six victories and ﬁve defeats. The

series began away back in 1909 and
ended in 1937. The Irish won the
ﬁrst game 6-0. and in 1911 the game
ended in a scoreless tie, the only
tie game of the series.

4 The Notre Dame teamlof 1912
won by a ﬁeld goal 3-0. That was
the team which featured an End

'»named Knute Rockne. The teams

d.id not meet again until 1930

' ‘ "when that End was Coaching the

team. ‘With a brilliant backﬁeld.
made up of Carideo, Schwartz,
Brill, and Savoldi, Notre Danle

‘ handed the Panthers a 35-17 loss.

Rockne was killed in a plane crash
the following year and Heartly
(Hunk) Anderson took over.

Anderson won his ﬁrst game
against Pitt at South Bend by a
15-21 score. The following year
Notre Dame was again highly fav-
ered, but a long run by Mike Sebas-
tian and an intercepted ‘pass gave
Pitt a 12-0 win. In 1933 Pitt won
at South Bend 14-0.

Elmer Layden succeeded Ander-
son as coach of the Irish in 1934 but
took a 19-5 lacing from the Pan-
thers in his-ﬁrst scheduled game
with them. But Marty Peters kicked
.a ﬁeld goal in the ﬁnal nlinutes of
the 1935 game to give Notre Dame
a 9-6 victory. , *

.-.v .. ..

THE PROBABLE STARTING BACKFIELD: Frank Knisley -at left
halfback, Bill Abromitis at fullback, Lou Cheiko at right halfback, and

Joe Mocha at quarterback.

The 1936 meeting was won by
Pitt 26-0. It was during that game
that Elmer Layden ran out in the
midst of the game to protest a pen-
alty Umpire Al Slack called on the
Irish quarterback, O’Rei1ly.' The re-
sultant unfavorable publicity is
said to have had much to do with
the suspension of the series until

this time.

The Panthers have had lnore than
their share of hard luck with player
injuries, player “raids,” and player
draftees. But the breaks are bound
to start coming their way some-
time and if they should happen to
start Saturday, Notre Dame might
have good reason to look out.

Some Hints, Helpful and

Otherwise on the "T"

Something new has been added
to the football team this year in
addition to a new coach, new play-
ers, and new red and white uni-
forms. For Pitt, heretofore sym-
bolic of single wing power football,
has a new system, the “T” forma-
tion.

The “T” formation, one of the
oldest in football, derives its name
from its resemblance to the alpha-
betical letter when the backﬁeld is
lined up.

The ends are cutloﬂ’ from the
tackle‘ from one to two yards. The
halfbacks straddle the outside leg
of their own tackles about four
yards from the line of scrimmage.
The quarterback is directly back
of the center. The fullback lines
up directly behind him, about four
and one-half yards from the line
of scrimmage.

The modern “T” formation af-
fords a “boxing” type of offense.
The quick openings plays can be
compared to the left jab of a boxer,
the man-in-motion and the faking
of the backs to the feints, and the
fullback plays to the real punch.
The pass plays can be considered
the unexpected sock.

one must_ have ‘quick starting
backs who are good fakers and
dangerous in the open. The half-
backs must be good ass receiv-
ers. The fullback should be fast,
a powerful runner, and hard to

bring down. The quarterback, who -

is the brains of the T formation,
must be a good passer; if'he is
. fast, so much the better.

The linemen do a great deal of
individual blocking. They are not
required to move a man as much

‘in the “T” offense as they are to

keep him from moving right or left.
Cross blocking comes into play fre-

quently. Speed and pass catching.

ability are more important in the
ends than size.

Above all, the “T” emphasizes
speed and deception. Deception is
obtained by the quarterback’s
handling of the ball, the "faking of
the backs, and the man in motion.
The center, who is badly handi-.
capped as a blocker in most for-
matidns, can take a stance in the_

“T” that enables him to charge ,

as he passes. He is not required
to look at the ‘receiver but can
keep his head up and see what is
going on.

It is a formation that is fun to

To make this type of oﬁ'ense go, play. It is also fun to watch.

Tradition With Panthers
Even if Bookies Are Not

The bookies and prognosticators
may favor Notre Dame tomorrow,
but tradition favors Clark Shaugh-
nessy and his 1943 Panthers. For
in 39 years Pitt has lost but one
home opener and that was in 1941
when Pitt fell before an inferior
Purdue squad 6-0.

Even then tradition almost won
out, for the Panthers opened the
game by running the ball down to
the Boilermaker three yard line in
the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of play. But
the Purdue line- held and Pitt never
again even got close.

Priorto 1940 Pitt had a record
of never having lost an opening
game anywhere. But in 1940 Ohio
State stained the record‘ by blasting
Pitt 30-7, and Minnesota added an
exclamation point to the record

“Bring Out the Mattress Money 1"

That is the command for citizens of
Pennsylvania as the Third War Loan
now gets fully under way this week.

This money is needed, and also all
funds not actuallyrequired for necessary
living expenses, in order that we shall
“BACK THE ATTACK.”

Our men on the ﬁghting fronts are
surging ahead. They are proving their
ability to succeed in the face of terrible
dangers. They will not stop but they‘
must have supplies and equipment.

The duty of those at home is to pro-
vide that equipment—provide both the
funds to pay for the materiel required;
and also by ceaseless energy of our
workers produce the articles themselves.

Pennsglvanians to purchase one billion

another record will be broken to-
morrow when an estimated 65,000
persons crowd into the Stadium to
watch the renewal of the Pitt-
Notre Dame series. For this will be
the largest c_rowd ever to witness a
Pitt opening game and the largest
crowd to witness a Pitt game since
1937 when 76,000 people jammed
the Stadium to watch the third
meeting between Pitt and Fordham.

Pitt and Fordham had played to
two consecutive scoreless ties, and
interest was high. Then, too, Pitt
had the dream backﬁeld of Chicer-
neo, Cassiano, Goldberg, and Steb-
bins, a quartet that spelled box-
office anywhere. i

The Stadium, withsome 15 miles .

of seats, normally seats 60,000 but
the extra 16,000 were accommo-
dated by means of wooden boxes set
up along the track. However, Ath-
letic Director Jim Hagan has an-
nounced that no extra seats will be
‘set up for the clash with the Fight-
ing Irisli. ‘

The vast crowd can be attributed
to the general box oﬂice appeal of
Notre Dame, the interest in Clark
_Shaughnessy, and a general curi-
osity as to the kind of a team he
can fashion without beneﬁt of Navy
and Marine offerings.

It is indeed, a far cry from the
indiiference that characterized last
year’s footballvfans. A meager 61,-
000, the lowest in modern Pitt grid-
iron history, turned out for ﬁve
home games_ last season———fo-ur thou-
sand less than are expected to turn
out for one game this year.

This vast sum is equivalent to the sale

-of a $100 bond for every man, woman

and child in the Commonwealth. It is a
high goal, but this country is in this War
for the highest of goals, “The preserva-
tion of Democracy.” The part that the
citizens ‘of Pennsylvania are now called
on to play is no more than our just share
of the great national effort. ‘
E. A. Roberts, chairman of the War
Finance Committee for Pennsylvania
and the leader of the Third War Loan
Campaign has pointed out _ that the
money is available. Some of it has been
stored away for a rainy day and. has beef:
may be in the mattress; in the old
cracked tea-pot or sugar bowl, high on

s

the cupboard shelves.

It,is doing no good there. In fact it is
doing a great deal of harm, for it is lying
in idleness and helping to cause inﬂa-

tion. Eurthermore it is not safe. It may .

be available to the owner but it also
provides an opportunity for thieves. Use
it now to buy a bond. It is safe. It is
always redeemable ifmoney is needed.
It will earn interest for the owner.

In the rural districts of the state the
farmers have been producing more crops
in response to the national call. Their
machinery is deteriorating rapidly and
they are doing the best they can with the
implements available. The crops are sold
readily and the money, if ‘placed in war
bonds, will be on hand when new equip-
ment can be obtained.

Workers in industry are earning more
than they have for years. In fact, with
the shortage of consumer supplies, they
are receiving more than-they can spend.
This extra is the money that will help
the state to ﬁll its quota. This money,
thus saved, can be used to buy that long-

‘desired automobile, sewing machine, ice-

ox or other longed-for product, when
the war is over and industry has re-
turned to a peacetime operation.

If all people do this with funds not
needed vitally, it will prevent the sear-
ing of prices of those commodities which
we must have to sustain our standards
of living. More members of each family _
are working now than ever before. They
are needed to produce the sinews of war, ‘
and they must give willingly of time and
energy to maintain a peak production.
But they are earning and the money they
earn must be returned to the channels
that will enable their work to continue
unhindered. So every one must BACK
