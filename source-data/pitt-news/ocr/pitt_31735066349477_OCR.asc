éﬁ-‘SGS Moves

Into CAS
Easier Now

BY KATHY McCAULEY

The recent modification in
admissions for School of General

Studies (SGS) students entering"

-1.___,_,AS is “more an administrative

2

change than anything else."
according to CAS Dean Robert
Marshall.

Any student in SGS seeking
admission to CAS will be admitted
automatically if he has 18-59
and at least a 2.5 average. or 60 or
more credits and at least a 2.0
average. SGS students previously
were required to apply through the
admissions office and show at least
a 3.0 average with 18-59 credits or
at least a 2.5 average with 60 or
more credits.

Arthur Fedel, SGS executive
associate dean, said the change will
facilitate the transfer of students to
CAS, since SGS students now can
bypass the admissions office.

.. According to Fedel, the impact

upon CAS students will be small,
since “not all that many (SGS
students) will be involved."

Dean of Admissions Kenneth
Wenger said students seeking
entrance to the preprofessional
schools still will go through the
standard admissions procedure.

Entrance to CAS by SGS
students is now no different than
for students of Pitt's Bradford.
Johnstown and Titusville cam-
puses.

The decision to modify the
admissions policy was made by the
‘CA5 Council on Jan.‘23. and was
effective from that date. C-AS

The Pennsylvania primary on
April 27 may contain the largest
number of candidates in state
history.

The State Election Bureau in
Harrisburg has not ﬁnished tabu-
lating the petitions of hundreds of
candidates who filed before Tues-
day’s deadline. Many candidates
filed on the last day.

At stake in the primary will be
party nominations for the State

House, the State Senate, the U.S. '

Senate, the U.S. House and two
state fiscal off1ces—treasurer, and
auditor general. ’ '

Delegates also will be elected for
the Democratic and Republican
national conventions.

Nominations in the Oakland
area's district are being nominally
contested. In the 19th District for
the State House, incumbent Demo-
crat ‘K. Leroy Irvis is unopposed,
while only one Republican seeks
nomination.

In the 22nd District's race, four
Democrats and one Republican are
seeking a vacant State House seat.

In the 43rd State Senatorial
District, which includes all of
Oakland, incumbent Democrat
James Romanelli is opposed by
Democrats Jack Barrett and Matt-
hew Drozo. -

The race for the U.S., Senate seat
held by Hugh Scott is being
heavily contested. Seeking the
Democratic nomination are U.S.
Rep. William J. Green of Philadel-
phia, State Sen. Jeannette F.
Reibman of Easton and Frank
Elliot, a Doylestown businessman.

Republicans running are U.S.
Rep. H. John Heinz of Fox Chapel;
Arlen Specter, a former newspaper
executive editor from Villanova,
and MaryiFoltz of Littlestown.

In the U.S. House 14th District,
covering downtown to Wilkins-
burg, incumbent U.S. Rep. William
S. Moorhead of Shadyside is
running unopposed for his nomina-
tion, while one Republican, John
Bradley of Centre Ave., has filed.

Pitt Prof Says "Cure"

BYTOMMIE NELL TAYLOR

A possible curefor sickle-cell
anemia has been publicized im-
properly, according to Dr. Dane
Boggs of Pitt’s hematology depart-
ment. _ ‘ _.

Boggs, the project director of a
National Institute of Mental Health
(N-IMH) study of sickle-cell anemia,
says the discovery was accidental
and may be premature.

Boggs explained that Donald
Ekong of the University of Ibadan
in Nigeria stumbled onto the
possible cure while studying a
native African root. Ekong found
that the root of the fagara tree,
used as a toothbrush by Africans
may provide a base for the
synthetic chemical that converts
diseased, sickle-shaped cells into
healthy, round'ones in test-tube
experiments.

While trying to determine if the
root contained. anti—bacterial sub-
stance, Ekong discovered the
conversion property.

Sickle-cell anemia is a gene-
tically transmitted disease, usually
fatal, contracted almost exclusively
by blacks or persons of Mediterra-
nean descent. The blood disease

‘annually affects 50,000 black

Americans.

, inatcd.

For Sickle Cell Early

Deformed sickle cells can’t pass
through blood vessels, causing
clotting and intense, pain.

Boggs said at least 30 to 50
known substances have the same
property as the fagara root
derivative.

He said news stories headlined

’ “Urea: a Dollar-a-Pound Cure for -

Sickle Cell” rallied false hope a
while ago.

Extensive animal research must
precede any testing of humans,
Boggs said. Ekong’s research
team said clinical results—on
humans—have yet to be obtained.

The Food and Drug Administra-
tion insists this testing must occur
successfully over a three-to-ﬁve
year period the drug can enter the
market.

Title IX Investigated,    fjil

Pitt Report Readied ‘ I

0 BY GEJORGENE KALEINA

University compliance with title
IX, a regulation that prohibits sex
discrimination in federally assisted
educational programs, will be
investigated as data is gathered for

‘a final report, according to Pitt’s

Coordinator for Title IX, Alden E.
Bowen. _

By July 21, Pitt must complete a
self-evaluation that may show some
aspects of the University are not in
compliance with Title IX, Bowen
said. 

Title IX 'of the Education
Amendments of 1972 states “No
person in the United States shall,
on the basis of sex, be excluded
from participation in, be denied
beneﬁts of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance.” The
provision became effective last July
21. -

As the coordinator, Bowen
answers inquiries from people who
think they may be out of line with
the mandate and determines if
grievances are reasonable.

Congressional limbo.

Education Bills Up for Grabs,   

BY KAREN KLEBER

Student financial aid bills are
being delayed in the authorization
and appropriations committees of
the House and Senate by conflicts

-- between public and private higher

education institutions.

Under House Bill 2471. its
congressional sponsor -seeks re-
moval of the half—cost provision of
the Basic Education Opportunity
Grant (BEOG). which , currently
restricts the grant to no more. than
half the recipient's total cost of
attendance.

According to Pitt's ﬁnancial aid
director, Charles Dees, out-of-state
as well, as dorm resident and
commuter students would beneﬁt if
the half-cost provision were elim-

basis‘.

The House bill also would keep
the maximum basic grant at $1,400
and raise the eligible family-
income ceiling for aid to $20,000.

Under Senate Bill 2657, the
maximum BEOG would be increas-
ed from $1.400 to $1,800. but the
half-cost provision would be
retained. ‘
‘ The National Association of State
University Land Grant Colleges has
requested that Congress eliminate
the half-cost provisions of BEOG
and allow full payments of
attendance costs up to $1,600.

It also supports retention of the
Supplemental Education Oppor-
tunity Grant (SEOG) formula.
which presently al-locates funds on
a 65% public and 35% private

J‘ ' w.

 

Bowen also will be one of the
designers of a grievance procedure
for members ofthe Pitt community

who feel they have been subjected 

to discrimination.

Bowen, who is also campus 

judicial system coordinator, said

The American Association of
Colleges (AAU) also is seeking
reduction of the half-cost limita-
tions on the BEOG program.

The AAU insists the formula for
SEOG be revised to a 70% private -.
30% public allocation.

In addition. the AAU is against
the deletion of ‘the Guaranteed
Student Loan (GSL) Interest

Fred Harris of Oklahoma.

President Ford runs unopposed
in the Republican presidential

To be eligible to vote in the
primary, a person must register by
March 29. Voters must be U.S.
citizens, must be at least 18 by the
day after the election, and must
have_ been residents of their
districts for at least 30 days.

What can you do with only a bachelor’s degree?

Now there is a way to bridge the gap between an
undergraduate education and a challenging, respon-
sible career. The Lawyer's Assistant is able to do
work traditionally done by lawyers.

Three months of intensive training can give you
the skills—the courses are taught by lawyers. You
choose one -of the seven courses offered—choose‘
the city in which you want to work.

Since 1970. The Institute for Paralegal Training
has placed more than 1200 graduates in law firms,
_banks, and corporations in over 75 cities.

e If you are a senior of high academic standing and
are interested in a career as a Lawyer’s Assistant,

to vote must either vote at home on
election day. or ﬁle change-of-
address forms to vote at school.

Students who live outside Alle-
gheny County may vote in their
home districts if they apply for
absentee ballots from their own
county election boards by March
23. Voters who are physically
disabled or who will be out of the
county on election day also ma
apply for absentee ballots.

Students who are registered to
vote in a district within Allegheny
County but who reside at Pitt, in
another district, may not vote
absentee unless they are out of the
county on election day. Students
using absentee ballots except
under that condition face $1,000
ﬁnes and one year in prison. To
vote legally, these students must
ﬁle change-of-address forms.

‘A voter registration drive,
sponsored by the College Young
Democrats and Pitt College Re-
publicans, will be held at Pitt on
March 10 and 11.

According to Joe Adamczyk,
executive director of the College
Republicans, a goal of registering
1,000 to 1,500 voters has been set.

Title IX Investigated,

(Continued from Page 1)
questions for different areas of the
Uni\'ersit_\f"have been drawn up to
find if there is fair treatment for
men and women.

V This applies to students. faculty.
employes and administrators. ac-
cording to Bowen.

“These questions are now being
evaluated by computer technicians
who. in turn, can tell from the
question if they have the data to
answer them." Bowen said. "The
computers can tell us a lot, for
example, what the average salary
of a certain job classiﬁcation is, and
then break it down into the salaries
forthe men and the women in the
job."

The questions the computer
can-not answer will be returned and
submitted to the more than 20 Title
IX unit coordinators throughout the
University, according to Bowen.

“When we get all this data, we'll
see where there may “be a
disproportion of the treatment of
men and women in a certain area
and will either ask for more data or
examine the area," he said.

He pointed out that some areas.
such as the football program, after
being examined may prove to be in
compliance, since there may be a

desire to be a part of that program.

Since Title IX requires that
sex be discriminated
against. it also applies to men,
according to Bowen. For example,
if a predominantly female school
has higher admissions require-
ments for men, then it would be out
of compliance with the mandate.

Bowen said the regulation also
requires that where there has been
discrimination in the past, “affir-
mative movements" must be made
to make up for it.

"This is a part of Affirmative

Action and theresponsibility of its '

director, (Assistant to the Chancel-
lor Dr. Maryann Bishop)."

After all the data is tabulated
and studied, a ﬁnal report will be
submitted to Bishop and Chancel-
Ior Wesley Posvar, according to
Bowen. '

‘_‘This report will contain statis-
tics and data that hopefully will
show us if we are treating men and
women fairly in similar situations,"
Bowen said. “We also will have the

.report for HEW to see. but we

don't submit it to them unless

requested."

The University will be given until
July. 1978 to comply fully with the
regulation. “Where we ﬁnd dis-
criminatorv practices. immediate
steps must be taken to remedy the
situation, " Bowen said.

The University will be looked at
in terms of units such as the
Nursing School, CAS and the

' Engineering School.

Bowen said in November that the
penalty for noncompliance with
Title IX would be the loss of federal
assistance within the units

Some things that may be affected
by Title IX are physical education
classes, admission of students,
athletic programs and University
em Ioyment.

 i(Toodi   Student Coalitions

lt’s about time someone decided to organize a student coalition with

a broad base of support.

_, Two developments last Thursday moved Pitt students closer to a
more pluralistic system of responsive action.

, First, the Student Government Board (SGB) approved a motion to set
up a United Students’ Cabinet that would help student groups act
collectively in dealings with the administration. Second, a meeting
sponsored by the Black Action Society and the Collective for
1 Alternative Education discussed the possibility of organizing a Student

Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH).
These groups will extend the horizons of student government both in

‘H the numbers they can gather in supporting an issue and in the

effectiveness they will have. SGB President Barry Weisband should
utilize the groups wisely, since he and the other Board members called
I for'such organizations in the ﬁrst place and since representatives of .

residents, Greeks, commuters and other groups extending themselves
willingly beyond the responsibilities they have to their own groups.

While such working coalitions have been long-awaited, a word of

caution must go out to anyone who may have the intention of working

independently of the SGB.

A consortium that intends to bargain for students will be respected
by the administration" only if it works hand-in-hand with Student

community with its positions and
viewpoints. This is only natural. A
collective bargaining election is an
‘intensely political process; if you

want to win friends and influence

people at the grass roots level, you

have to make the same pitch over .

and over again. Moreover, academ-
ics are nothing if not articulate,

- which again serves to increase the

verbal output. Nonetheless, this
point in the election campaign is
perhaps an excellent time to step
back and assess the merits of the
respective positions, which by now
are substantially complete.

First, it is clear that the prize for
generating an atmosphere of “the
sky is falling and we must run and
tell the king" must clearly be

in ‘T, awarded to the Teachers for an

‘Independent Faculty. One might
‘have thought that the supporters of
the “no agent" position would
have run a noncampaign, folding
their arms in philosophical serenity
and awaiting the administration's
announcement of a 12-15 percent
salary increase on election eve.
instead the T.i.F. has presented
the grim scenario that if collective
bargaining wins at Pitt. the
University will be turned into two
heavily bureaucratized armed

camps at best; at _worst, some even

' predict the end of the University as

 

. we know it.

Now the Pitt Professional Union
has_ always firmly maintained that

. everyone would benefit considerab-

-ly from collective bargaining and
‘Would be correspondingly worse off
without it. Below we shall give
some of the reasons for our
position. But when it comes to
rhetorical “overkill" the T.l.F. is
in a class by itself.

A closer analysis reveals that.

T.I.F.’s doom"-mongering is no

 

accident. .In‘ the 1960s “andearlyp.

I outcome—-something that would have been impossible without’ a
I coordination of roles. ' '

 The PPpUi's position

1970s it was still possible for
administrations to preempt at-
tempts at faculty unionization, but
no longer. Anyone acquainted with
Gov. Shapp’s budget knows that
the money just‘isn’,t there with
which to buy off faculty discontent.
Accordingly, T.I.F. has to conjure
up the fear of rampant bureau-
cracy.-The only problem is, big
bureaucracy is already here at Pitt.
It is reported that when the Provost

, ﬁrst came to Pitt from Northern
Illinois University, he was astonish-

ed by what he felt was Pitt’s
bureaucratic top-heaviness.

.Where does the proliferation of
bureaucracy come from? Paradox-
ically, one reason for it is the
absence of -collective bargaining.
Consider the example of the FAS
Tenure and Promotion Review
Board. The resolution calling for
the board in its present form was
drawn up by Richard Tobias of the
AAUP and supported by the PPU.
But. through neither Tobias’ nor
the PPU’s fault, the board has
become a time-consuming failure
rather than an instrument of real
faculty governance, because -the
Dean remains free_ to adopt or

vreject its findings as he sees ﬁt.
Mutatis mutandis, the same holds‘

true for most other areas of
University governance. More and
more, key areas of decision-making
are taken over by the administra-
tion bureaucracy. If anything,
collective bargaining will stream-
line and rationalize administration
because decisions will be binding.

On the issue of tenure. for
example, the PPU believes that the
decision to grant tenure is
fundamentally a decision at the
department level to elect a new
permanent member of the faculty.
There are no grounds for any
control of the tenure-granting
process by the administration. A
really collegial system of gover-
nance would mean that faculty not
only made all decisions about
tenure and promotion but also
elected and held responsible to it
all chairmen and higher adminis-
trators. Responsibility for making
academic policy should rest with
the faculty. ‘since it is directly
responsible for’the teaching and
research mission of the University.

Death for Higher Education

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Higher education. exempliﬁed
by ﬁne institutions like Pitt. is due
for _a shock in the next ﬁve years.
According to the University’s own
planning experts, the enrollment
here‘ will take a nosedive in 1980,
and according to government
experts (at least under Gov. Milton
Shapp) this is a good reason to
slash the money for college
educations.

If nothing else, higher education
provided some sort of ‘ social
mobility in this country. Through
attendance in college, the sons of
laborers could step into the next
higher class, make the move up
and out of their home towns, and
even if many couldn't follow, at‘
least they could watch and know it
was all possible.

At Pitt this is particularly true.
There is a high ratio of ﬁrst- and
second-generation university stu-
dents at this institution, and a good
many are here probably to seek the
beneﬁts of social mobilization.‘ ‘

‘ For the kid who wants to get
somewhere, there are some classic
institutions in this country for
moving up the ladder and asserting
personal_ freedom. I First is higher
education. There is also capital-

ism. And there is also organized'_

crime. Finally there is politics, but
this last method must involve some
link with the ﬁrst three. ,
Through .these methods, young
people with “drive, ambition,
intelligence and desire can move

 For CI First-Rate Institution

The PPU does not seek to abolish
the-traditional forums of faculty
authority like the University
Senate; rather, we seek to
strengthen and augmeiit them
through collective bargaining in
line with the -new problems the
University is facing in these times
of ﬁnancial stringency.

A somewhat surprising but
highly encouraging development
has been Pitt/AAUP’s conversion
to a position which supports
collective’ bargaining. Throughout
the -1974-75 academic. year, when
the PPU began the campaign for
collective bargaining alone, it
appeared that the AAUP was more
intent on nit-picking than on
coming togrips with the economic
and professional issues affecting
the Pitt faculty. But this has
changed, and today Pitt/AAUP is
swimming vigorously with . the
:mainstream towards collective bar
gaining documented by Seymour
Martin Lipset and, Everett Carll
Ladd, Jr. in the Chronicle of Higher

. Education. _ .

However, traces of naivete about

' the nature of collective bargaining
For example. Professor

remain.
Spaulding in his Pitt'Nc\\s column
on unionization. chided the PPU for
working out of “an industrial
model of collective bargaining with
high dues to support organizers
dedicated to creating adversary
conditions between faculty and
administration." Here we have
two criticisms rolled into one. As
for the PPU having dues compar-
able to other unions, we. make no
apologies. Unlike members of a
professional _ society, who usually
expect (and receive) little more
than a quarterly journal for their
dues. the services which a union
provides for its members costs
money. Among these, incidentally,
was the cost of the PPU’s legal
support staff which actually.ob-

tained the bargaining unit for the‘

upcoming election in the Labor
Board hearings. Without this
support, the issue of unionization
at Pitt would

remained an “academic" quest-ion.

The criticism thatlthe PPU is
“dedicated to creating adversary
conditions" is more complex’. ‘Both

. \ I

 

literally have

into the ranks of those who make

decisions and who have power in"

this country. One kid on the block
making it to Harvard goes a long
way towards maintaining peace
and tranquility. Those left behind
have no one to blame but
themselves for their failure to
"make it."

Perhaps for this reason, Ameri-
cans long have been ﬁnding a class
consciousness in the classic Marx
and Engels sense. One does not
belong to the “working class"; one
simply is waiting for the Big Break.
If you_missed the Big Break. you
have no one to blame but

» yourself—-certainly not the system.

It is when people start blaming
the system for their failures, when
methods of social mobilitybreak
down, that these people begin the
struggle for a revolution. The great
race riots were a function of a
people who demanded to be let in
on the fruits of social mobility and
who, if necessary, would change
those methodslby the inﬂuence of
gun muzzles. .

The black capitalism drive was
perhaps a cynical but an astute
move on the part of federal powers
to safety-valve some of this energy.
Likewise, educational programs
like the UCEP program here at Pitt
are aimed primarily at opening up
the promise of social mobility to a
people formerly disenfranchised
and trapped.‘ Whatever else they
do, these programs ensure the best
and the brightest ﬁnd a direction
for their achievement and brilli-
ance. The rise of a black middle
class. in some ways indistinguish-
able from‘ its white counterpart,
attests to the success of this sort of
strategy by the planners in
Washington.

In sum,‘ then. the dynamics of
social mobility, or even the promise
of s_ocial’mobility, is simply one"of
those basic institutions that has
enabled this country (a bizzare and
freakish political experiment) -to
remain stable.

As long as someone, anyone,_

feels he has a stake, he for all
‘intents and purposes remains loyal
to the current system. There is
nothing wrong with that (someone

But listen, Mr. Shapp and those
who plan the fate of these

on higher education is not only to
damage society now, but also to

that the man they face three times
a week in class_once faced Senate
investigating committees and com-
munity criticism.
In early 1961, the Pennsylvania
State Senate, confronted with
allegations that Colodny was a
communist, withheld $4 million in
state aid from Pitt, until his
‘background could be investigated.
Though most students stood solidly
behind him, they found a pleasant
diversion from their nantv raids in
debating the question:
Colodny worth a few million
dollars? Some called him a political
lackey of Moscow; others called
him the ﬁnest teacher at Pitt. In the
end, though,’ most agreed there

wasn't a history professor—alive'

worth that much money.

Colodny crams tobacco into the
bowl of a short-stemmed pipe with
his right thumb; his left hand holds

ithe lapel of his shabby brown
sports coat, as he remembers.

“What started the whole thing

Several people in Pittsburgh saw’

the advertisement, which said
Castro wasn't getting a fair
treatment by the American news
media. And in the anti-Cuban
atmosphere that prevailed four
months before the Bay of Pigs
operation, Colodny’s name did not

escape notice.

that Colodny left the unit in 1938
when _it was purely a fighting unit

And though the Brigade eventually

imagined Colodny teaching about

In the wake of the article, state
Supreme Court Justice Michael
Musmanno, and state Congress-
man John Walsh from McKeesport
demanded that Colodny be investi-
gated, while the state Senate held a
$4 million Sword of Damocles over
the head of the University.

Eventually, the _House Un-

(HUAC) in Washington subpoen-

last national case of communist
witch-hunting against academics in
the country. .

The results of the investigation
were made public in May, 1961, in
a thousand-page document that
cleared Colodny of all charges.
Then Chancellor Edward Litch-
field, who submitted the report to
the state Senate, commented:
“Those who publicly try by
innuendo...are not different from
those who purge without a
hearing."

Looking back, Colodny isn't
really surprised at the actions of
the politicians who had attacked
him. “Walsh had been doing this
sort of thing since the beginning of
the McCarthy era. but I think he
wanted the publicity, as he was

When Colodny/says .“This was
their mistake." his tone seems to
show pity to people who should
have known they were simply
outclassed. '

Colodny rocks back and forth on
his office swivel chair. which is
badly in need of oil, puts his hands
behind his head and shifts into the

Iron. City Troupe

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN
“Mime isn’t simply the mimick-
ing of daily activities; it is
something more than classical

, illusion. It is deeper than these,”

Director of the Iron City Mime
Troupe Nancy Lyon explains.

The Iron City Mime ‘Troupe,
which performed at Pitt Saturday
night, is held together, sometimes

loosely, by this philosophical

thread. To the troupe, the

pantomime is more than making’
“ people laugh. it is also a vehicle for

social commentary.
Despite last-minute substitution
for injured" players and faulty

-lighting in the Student Union

Ballroom, the troupe managed an
assortment of Marcel Marceau-like
classic illusion and some deeper,

A ‘more moving pieces. The show was

the troupe’s first as a professional

" ' company.

The performers’ basic flaw was
their inability to complete their
illusions. There were too‘ many
ragged edges and uncountedbeats
that resulted in cloudiness. The
costumes themselves were loose

andﬂappy and tended to'« distract .

the viewer from paying attention to
the illusions.

But the mime troupe’s purpose is
to entertain, and the Iron City
Mime Troupe was fun to watch.
was
especially entertaining for people
fromiPitt, and the troupe made the
audience “see" scalpers, dead
bodies and street cleaners. The
company also performed “The

Bathroom, or It’ll Only Take a
Minute,” giving the audience a
good chance to laugh at typical
activities, like brushing teeth and
taking a shower.

The best illusions of the evening
were the solos, particularly “The
Tuba Player,” performed by Lyon
and “William Tell,” performed by
Ed Swerdlow.

  
   

Several selections, like Marty
Gronsky’s and Lyon's performance
of “Reflections,” narrowly missed
excellence. The piece is a mimist’s
portrayal of ‘through the looking
glass’ and the fear of crossing the

supervision.

Experimental Theater
Acts Life After Death

BY DAVID ASHLEY

The current offering of the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre,
The Long Sonata of the Dead,
based on the writings of Samuel
Beckett and conceived by Bill
Royston and Kate Nicholas, is
experimental theater at its best-
innovative. challenging and exqui-
sitively discomforting. Like a first
taste of hard liquor, Royston’s
production is hard to stomach, but
the awareness that one is not
thoroughly “enjoying” the sensa-
tion is tempered by the suspicion
that the experience is not only
worthwhile but also positively
educational.

Described by Royston as “anti-
theatrical" with no traditional plot,
Thl‘ Long Sonata of the Dead is a
pastiche based on Beckett's theo-
ries of death and metaphysics. The
company of five (Nicholas, Ra-
mona Rischer, Caryl Opshinsky,
Eluyne Ringler and Phil Thomson)
are encased in coffins. and urns
from the neck down——only their
heads are visible. They look
straight ahead, their faces never
swivel, they speak only when
illuminated (or perhaps they speak

  British "Queen" Plays

S Tricks, Rock Music

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The show was billed as “A Night
at the Opera,” and although the
atmosphere was right, in reality it
was not opera. It was something
more, much louder,,_ twice as
exciting and refreshingly unique.

The band was Queen, and on
Friday night at the new Stanley
Theatre, it delivered a set of
mature, progressive British rock
done in traditional royal fashion
that should serve as a precedent for

'3 years to come.

The music (drawn from Queen's
four Elektra albums) .had many
colors~—a little classical folk, opera,
baroque and pop and plenty of
inventive hard rock——combined
with an abundance of timely stage
effects (smoke cannisters, a revolv-
ing, crystal diamond and ﬁre

flashes) and stage presence, for

one very uniﬁed and entertaining
package.

Queen opened mysteriously, as
smoke covered the stage during the
haunting “Ogre Battle,” “Sweet

Lady” (nasty rock n’roll), “White

Queen,” and “Flickof the Wrist”

(both'ballads). .All of these
selections‘ showed very early the

;-\.versatility that Queen brings to the

concert setting. _ - __

A medley of “Bohemian Rhap-
sody” (a million-seller in England),
“Killer Queen” and “March of
the Black Queen” featured the
continental man himself—lead
singer Freddie Mercury on piano
and vocals. Mercury is ‘not only an
excellent frontman, but also quite a
campy cabaret comedian.

“Bring Back that Leroy Brown”
and “Lazin’ on a Sunday After-
noon” seem like _cute throwaway

V songs on record, but on stage they

injected that dry British wit, with
Mercury soft-shoein’ it and
honky-tonkin’ his way across the
stage runway while Brian May
strummed away on his miniature
banjo and kept the audience and
the band from being caught up in
all the regal pomp and circum-
stance.

Queen’s versatile but hard rock
is what it does best.

The heavenly “Prophet’s Song’-’
(featuring the angelic voices of all
four band members) had a euphoric
lulling effect, as the stage was once
again shrouded in fog, and the
crowd was mesmerized by the
overhead crystal before the mania-
cal “Stone Cold Crazy” woke up
everyone, including the Stanley
Theater Ghost. “Brighton Rock”

featured Brian__May on guit (_he‘_>

himself), and “Keep Yourself
Alive” and “Liar” featured the
whole band cooking collectively.
“Lap ofthe Gods” finished the
set on a mystical note, and the
encore numbers of “Now I’m
Here” (in which the band changed
from white~ to black-satined
costumes) and a. good-time ’50s
medley of “Jailhouse Rock/ Blue

- Suede Slices,” humorously ended

“The Night at the Opera.” Was

this a parody of the regal routs?

Queen is refreshingly versatile,
musically unique and theatrically
tasteful. The show was delivered
with class, ﬂash and, thank
goodness, wit. Many left the
Stanley Theatre‘ with that special
“rock n’roll after-glow.”

“God save the Queen!”

Trish. Begly. .
The cast's diction is precise and ,
well-cued. It is not so much what is ._ V
said that matters, but how it is _
said. Like music, form supercedes — I
content. Royston has described the
adaptation of Beckett's . work—«
largely his prose work—as a

 

‘symphony constructed with the

author's sense of language. If so, it
is a symphony in sonata form.

The Long Sonata has the
traditional form of exposition,
development and recapitulation. It
is a symphony made with spoken
sounds, atonal and dissonant——
never medodious or harmonic.

There are differences, however, . ,_
No reconciliation ofinternaltension , .-
is to be found within the corpus of
the work, and most fundamental of ,
all. there is no orchestration. The “
characters occasionally may speak7
inunison. but when this happens,
each merely obscures the sense of
what the others are saying.--' In
Beckett's philosophy, there is no
place for a cosmic orchestra,‘ let
alone the universal conductor.’

As Beckett explains in Molloy,
“All I know is what the words
know, and the dead things,’ and ' g
that makes a handsome little sum,‘ » - 
with a beginning, a middle and an
end as in the well-built phrase and '
the long sonata of the dead." a

the easy lay-ups. Jefferson, PSU’s
6-8 center, had 11 points in the
rugged ﬁrst half, mostly on short
shots and tips.

But, the Cats were not to be
denied at least one road win this
season. At halftime, they made the
adjustment that turned the game
around.

Having brought its guards in
toward the key to jam up the
center, Pitt functioned to perfec-
tion, and behind the scoring of
Harris, freshman Wayne Williams,
and senior co-captain Tom Ri-
chards, notched its 10th win
against 15 losses.

Penn State, playing lesser
competition than Pitt all year,
dropped to a woeful 9-15 mark.

Penn State was paced by
Jefferson and Erichsen, who had 18
apiece. Harris, shooting 10-16 from
the ﬁeld, had 25, Williams had 12
and Richards had eight for the
Cats. ’

The Panthers’ n/ext opponent will
be the University of Indiana. No, I
don’t mean the No. 1-ranked
Indiana Hoosiers; I'm referring to
Indiana of Pennsylvania.

If you enjoyed the Buffalo State
massacre, don’t miss it. Game time
is 8 p.m. tonight at the Field

The Pitt track team returned
home from the Central Collegiate
Chanipionships with more than just
several awards. It also acquired a
lot of respect and conﬁdence. Sixth
place in the standings among 25
teams is a great start for the
Panthers.

BY TOM HALL

UNIVERSITY PARK—The Penn
State Nittany Lions captured the
ﬁrst Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) title Saturday afternoon by

Pantherettes Lose Twice

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette basketball team
dropped both games this weekend.
Pitt was edged out in the final
minutes by I.ock Haven, 60-54,
Friday night, and got mauled the
next afternoon at State College,
97-60, by a strong Penn State
squad. _

Though the game at Lock Haven
was close, Pitt managed to

maintain a slight lead throughout.
the evening and was ahead, 52-48, ,

when with three minutes remaining

' Lock Haven took charge. It quickly

scored a dozen points and held the
Pantherettes to just one bucket.

The loss obscured fine efforts by

scoring and rebounding for Pitt;
she tossed in 14 points and hauled
down 18 rebounds. Raymond, fully
recovered from early season
injuries, chipped in 13 points and
_brought in 12 rebounds.

Penn State dominated Pitt from
the opening buzzer, shooting an
amazing 82% from the field in the

Dukes Slip Past Mighty Pitt With LastMinute Goal  

BY STEVE SYBERT
Upsets are good for the sports
world. They bring the giants down
from their lofty perches in the

 heavens and give all the Jacks in

the world an occasional taste of
victory's golden bough.

Well, Jack, showed up at
Duquesne on Saturday, climbed a
beanstalk to the Civic Arena, then
ran away with a 2-1 decision over
the Pitt Hockey Club, the Dukes’
first win over the Panthers in five
years of club hockey competition.

The time was ripe for the Dukes
to slay a giant, for Pitt has been

~playing so poorly as of late, they
should perhaps look to the high
schools for competition.

It was expected to be an easy win
for the Panthers, but Duquesne
surprised everyone by playing
possibly its best game of the
season, while Pitt, continuing its
tailspin, played its worst.

The Panthers have now lost five
of their last six games and have
seen what once was a good record
fall to 6-6-1. And with a lot of good
competition remaining, they may
be headed for a losing season
unless things are turned around
right away.

The loss to Duquesne, coach Len
Barcalow feels. was due ‘to the
Panthers‘ taking the Dukes'for
granted, for previously, the two
teams had never really played a

    BY ADMINISTRATION

WHAT ”NO AGENT”
  REALLY MEANS

A group calling itself Teachers for an Independent Faculty (TIF) has emerged to

  
  

urge members of the faculty to vote “no agent” in the upcoming representation election.
“No agent” doesn’t exist. i

If we wish to continue to be represented by management, then we should vote “no
agent.” But if, in fact, we are genuinely interested in an independent faculty we should
decide on collective bargaining which guarantees that faculty will have representation with

force of law.

If we want decisions affecting research, class size, accountability, academic freedom,
tenure quotas, etc. to be made by management experts rather than by faculty, then we
~ should vote “no agent.” Butif we want these fundamental decisions to be.made by an inde-

pendent faculty then we should decide on collective bargaining.

If we want the direction and thrust of the University to be set by people whose chief
accountability is to a corporation, or to a political boss, then we should vote “no agent.”-
But if we want policy and govemance by an independent faculty then we should vote on

collective bargaining.

There can be no doubt of the appeal of faculty independence, so when aﬂgroup, in
this case TIF, asserts that voting “no agent” will mean independence for faculty, there is

likelihood that some, perhaps even many, faculty will bepersuaded. We hope not.

If this were the best of all possible worlds there would be no need for unions and A
collective bargaining. Nor would there-be a need for vaccines, hospitals or ‘lawnmowers. The
world, alas, is ‘not as we would like it but as it is. We should therefore adjust to dealing with
it as it is, and learn to be successful at it, in our own interest and for the sake of our pro-'

fession.

Knowing what we do about university management and how decisions are made on
the broad scale at Pitt, it would be irresponsible to vote “no agent” because what we would
«_ be voting for in fact is REPRESENTATION BY MANAGEMENT. That’s mainly what we

have now, and that’s what we would reinforce with a “no agent” vote.
What we are saying is simply this: if ‘we want a genuinely independent faculty we

should vote FOR collective bargaining. What follows, then, is equally simple. If we .want_
true independence for faculty, vote for PSEA/NEA—PITT.
