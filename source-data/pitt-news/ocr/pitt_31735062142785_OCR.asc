Fowler Urges

On Housing

Veteran students dealt their
tough housing problem another
blow in thethird meeting of an
informal volunteer committee on
Wednesday afternoon.

James Fowler, chairman of the .
group, distributed cards on which
the house-seekers, veteram and
non-veterans alike, listed the
1 amber of rooms they needed and
maximum amount of rent which
they could pay. Any one in need
of housing who was unable to
attend Wednesdays meeting '»may
ﬁll out one of these cards by_ see-

men’s ofﬁce.

William F. Saalbach, assistant
to the dean of men, stated that
since Pitt is an urban university
with a predominantly local enroll‘-
ment, it has been the traditional
policy of the administration not
to furnish housing.

“However,” he continued, “the
dean of men’s office does maintain
a housing service as an aid to
non-resident students. Any work
which students can do for them-
selves along this line, ' collective-
ly or individually, is greatly ap-
preciated.” “ D

Fowler called on members to
investigate the various possibili-
ties of solution to their housing
situation and report the ﬁndings
back to the committee.

“All Pitt students can help
solve this perplexing problem by
reporting vacant, rooms, apart-
ments, and houses to the deanof
men’s office,” says Fowler.

Distribution

Seating capacity for only 2600
in the stadium pavilion, where
home basketball games will be
played, has necessitated the or-
ganization of a student ticket ex-
change. This will enablepas many

, students as possible to see at least

one home basketball game.

The student’s activities card
will be punched, and a ticket giv-
en him for admittance to the
game. Since all the members of
the large student body will not be
able to watch every contest, those

. who miss the ‘first Panther tilt,

Jan. 4, will be allowed to attend
a subsequent one. This system
will continue until the season
ends. ,

Tickets for the ﬁrst exchange

on Dec. 19, 20, and Jan. 2, ‘will
be distributed on a ﬁrst-come,
ﬁrst—serve basis until all are gone,
and will be good for the Pitt-Penn
State game on Jan. 4.
- Another exchange booth will be
set up for the second home con-
test on Jan. 13 with Westminster.
On Jan. 6 and 7, all those unable
to obtain tickets for the ﬁrst home
tilt will be allowed to obtain tick-
ets until the supply runs out.
However, if any tickets are left
over, they will be available to the
general student body on Jan. 8.

Student booths, one for men
and one for women, staffed by
members _of the athletic depart-
ment, will be installed on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
One of the booths will be in the
University bookstore, and the
other in the hall. Student identi-
ﬁcation card and activity card are
required for the exchange. The
booths will be open from 8 a. m.
to 5 p. m. on the days speciﬁed.

The exchange plan was devised
by athletic director James Hagan
and approved by the Faculty
Committee on Athletics.

‘topic is: RESOLVED: That the federal government should provide :5

Openllouse  

An- open-house, planned for

Jan. 8, will serve to welcome Pitt‘

Women to the “new” twelfth
ﬂoor, ,which will become the
nucleus of women’s campus ac-
tivities. .

Members of the WSGA SOCl?:ll
committee will act as hostesses.
showing visitors the rooms and
explaining the purpose of each.

Although the ﬂoor is now used
for studying and bridge-playing.
members of the executive com--
mittee feel an afternoon devoted
to an open-house will set the pace
for future policies.

New regulations permit women
to smoke in the Pine room on the
twelfth floor; a victrola and piano,
soon to be installed in the Pine
room, will ‘ provide music’ for
dancing, another innovation.

WSGA agenda includes plans
for obtaining ash trays lamps,
ping-pong tables, and other nec-
essary furnishings V *

The search for a Spring Festi-

snag according to Corinne ‘Nelan,
chairman of the student congress

the results of the month long
drive for a business iranager and

The committee has tried to la
emphasis on the contracting of a. ‘f

required to clear assured dates-
for the famous entertainers.

Chairman Nelan stated that, al-

over-sized affair has been handled
exclusively by seniors in the past,
no seniors had applied by Tues-P"

or so it was thought.

Most people said that they nev-
er would organize the listless

then a band of dynamic leaders
pushed to the front —— “Ike”
Icardi led the Pitt cheers at the
game on Saturday, and hollered
Independent through the week;
Irwin «Rosen. pounded. out story
after story for the Pitt‘News; Hi
Milton formulated policies and
objectives. The boys worked’ out
a huge yellow placard announcing
Independent aims. .

The men and women of Pitt
began to rally to the Independ-
ents. The opposition was tough.
The fraternity stronghold was the
student government. Hi Milton
originated a successful petition
which resulted in presenting the
student body with a referendum
for equal representation between
fraternities and independents in
student government; The referen-
dum was defeated by a single
vote. But the alert Independent
leaders pinned down a half dozen
cases of fraudulent voting and
amidst a sea of affidavits. accusa-
tions, and denials, ai student gov-
ernment investigation committee
decided on a new cl.e~:-lion.

l The Independents won that sec-
’ond election. Pitt became one’ of
the few schools in the country
where student spi_rit was aroused
"enough to offset the usual fra-

ternity rule.

Indépendent pow-wows set ob-
jectives and means. They formu-
lated plans for such things as a
student run barber shop, lounge,
and recreation room.

Then came the war. Pitt’s' men
left the campus. activities were
pushed into the background and
normal campus life was at an end.’
The past slipped from the present
and lost its claim on the future.
The torch which burned - so
brightly at Pitt-in the spring of
1942, and ﬂickered into ashes as
the war trimmed the University
into a ghost of its former self; to-
day remains unlit. There is no
Independent association at the
University.

Fraternity men and women can
hardly be blamed for seeking
prestige; BMOC’s on campus are
a boon to a frat’s rushing pro-
gram. , ’

‘Fraternity domination of stu-
dent activity, and especially stu-

dent governing - activity has an

inherent w e a k n e s s, however,
which cannot be laid upon fra-

ternity men and women, but ex— .

ists nevertheless. Fraternities are
social organizations of the Uni-
versity. As such they are closely
coordinated with the dean of
men's and dean of women’s of-
ﬁces. Any plans originating from
fraternity groups can easily be
smoothed down, or smothered by
the deans? oﬂices if such plans are
thought to conﬂict with establish-
ed University policy.

There remains only the’ alterna-
tive of reforming the Independ-
ent association. The -_ association
must be supported by all students
who are interested in the further-
ance of unrestricted student par-
ticipation in the life of the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh for the bene-l

fit of the greatest number of stu-
dents.

dents must be not so r .ch to

ternities as to make for im-

Over AS

Veterans are normal. They have
housing problems; they study as
much as other Pitt students; and

their money doesn’t- go very far ,

either. At least that was. the opin-
ion expressed in a 15 minute dis-

cussion, “The Veteran at Pitt,” .

over WJAS this week.

Olive Playfoot, graduate veter-
an student, and Allan Dahlgren

stated the case of Pitt veterans‘

while J. Edward Ricart, veteran’s
counselor and assistant to the
dean of men, participated in be-
half of the University.

“We have found the veteran to
be a better than average student,”
stated Mr. Ricart. “His return ‘has
-been a real challenge to the fac-
ulty and has increased the tempo
of University 1ife.” ‘

Dahlgren thinks that housing is
the biggest worry of non-resident
married veterans. Because most
veterans‘ at Pitt attended. some
service school, they have prevent-

ed the troubles-om-e transition to -
- studying which all civilians seem-

ed to think they would experi-

ence. ‘ '
Money, $65 or $90 of it, isgthe

next largest problem. Miss Play-

foot and Mr. Dahlgren agree that ‘S I

it is advisable for the veteran to
have some outside source of in-
come, possibly a part time job.

“The Pitt Veterans association.

is thriving, but still its member-
ship numbers’ only about one-
eighth of the veterans in school,
commented Miss Playfoot.

The Kappa alumni are in «for a

since the “newer keys” decided
they’d throw a grand slam-—full
of candy canes, ice cream, and

If you haven’t seen many Phi

they are all busy spending their
time polishing up their new house.
By December 20th it will really
sparkle as they hold their gala
Christmas party to honor brother
Jack Durishan, recent ODK tap-

GI Insurance
Information

Many Pitt veterans are unaware
that Congress recently establish-
ed a liberalized policy for han-
dling National Service Life In-
surance.

Those who have allowed their
policies to lapse may have them
reinstated without .a physical ex-
amination‘ by submitting a state-
ment to the effect that their state
of heaﬁh has not changed since
the date of the lapse. The dead-
line for this action is January 31,
1947. _ .

For the beneﬁt of Pitt vets who
wish information on this, or other
matters concerning NSLI, J. E.
Ricart, counselor to veterans, has
secured the services of a govern-
ment insurance expert from the
Veterans administration. He will
be in the office of the dean of
men, today and all of next week.

Veterans may inquire about any
insurance problems. and receive

re-instatement, conversion, or
designation of beneﬁciaries. Con-
sultations will be from 9900 a. m.
to 5:00 pfm.

1 By Joseph Dym «

The modern Hungarian music
of Bela Bartok was the outstand-
ing feature of last week’s Pitts-
burgh Symphony concert. Bartok’s
Music from the Miraculous Man-
darin received more acclaim from
the large audience than the popu-
lar J. Straus Wiener Blut Waltzes.
Fritz Reiner’s direction of this

powerful music overshadowed his

usually brilliant rendition of the
R. Strauss tone—poem Don Juan.

Violinist Joseph Szigeti played
the seldom heard Beethoven Ro-
mance No. 1 in G Major, La. Fol-
lia by Corelli. and A, Portrait by
Bartok. Mr. Szigeti still retains
his position as one of the World’s
greatest violinists. D-r._ Bakaleini-
koff directs a series of three
“Concerts for Children” tomor-
row, March 8, and April‘19.
AT FOSTER MEMORIAL . . .

The University orchestra, di-
rected by Robert L. Arthur, will
be heard for the first time this
season .in a Christmas program
next Friday. The orchestra will
play many traditional Holiday
songs as well as some diﬂicult
novelty Christmas tunes. A large
percussiongsection will be used for
the latter numbers.

There are still some vacancies
in the string sections of the or-
chestra and anyone interested can
come ‘to rehearsals, which are
held every Monday at 4:30 p. m.
in room 817.

o The Cinderella of Chesapeake Bay is a queer look-
ing craft. She has no bow, no stern, no engine, no
crew. Never weighs,_anchor to make a voyage. But
she has a purpose, and has served it well.‘

Largely because of her, a new ﬂeet of ocean-going
passenger ships will have superstructures built of
aluminum. It reduces weight at the most important
place.-—“topside”. _

This is a dream come true for Alcoa engineers.
Eleven years ago they built this odd-shaped aluminum
test hull and anchored it in Chesapeake Bay. Together
with marine engineers and naval architects, they
watched to see the efllect salt water had on aluminum;
whether it would prove seaworthy. And it did!

But there were other problems ~——- for instance,
stresses topside, set up by the weaving and pounding
that a ship takes at sea. By building and testing a.
model,,Alcoa engineers found that the use of alumi-
num in the superstructure greatly reduced the stresses.
_They likewise conferred on plans and recommended
materials. v

30 the ships were built. They ‘are in the water now
being outfitted for their maiden voyages to China
;--thanks to Ciriderellzuand the “imagineers” who
dreamed of aluminum ships and then engineered them
, into the wa€é'i‘." Z V .

jsDoesn’t awcdmpany that pursues an ideal with such
intensity stir your imagination? lt’s fun to work with
men of vision’. Ideas click when men with imagination
plus engineering work with this versatile metal, alumi-
num, and with the greatest fund of aluminum knowl-
edgein the world . . . A1coa’s. ALUMINUM COMPANY

Notre Dame tops the list ‘with four of their footballers on the

men, and Jim Mello of the Irish backﬁeld were among those chosen. ,

Indiana ran a close second. Three Hoosiers were selected to berths
on the initial squad. They are end Lou ’Mlhajlovich_, center John
Cannady, and quarterback Ben Raimondi.

Four other enemy schools each placed one member of their squad
on the ﬂrst ‘team. Purdue’s clever halfback Harry Szulborski, and
Ohio State’s speed merchant Bob Brugge round out the oackﬁeld.
The remaining two linemen are Ed Kulakowski of West Virginia
and Alex Agase from the University of Illinois. ‘ '

The second team and the honorable-mentions contain an im-
pressive list of players from eight of the schools that battled the
Panthers this year. Only Marquette was not mentioned.

Many of the gridders chosen on these teams have been included
on the various All—American squads picked by the nation's football
experts. Such popular All-American choices as John Lujack, Con-
nor, and George Strohrneyer of Notre Dame, Alex Agase of Illinois,
and Warren Amling of Ohio State, gave the Panthers enough trouble

to be mentioned as all-opponents.

Meet Famed Illini “Whiz Kids”
In Severest Test of Trip _

by John Golightly
Content to forget the missed fouls and lay-ups which failed
to drop in against Ohio State, Pitt moves west for three games

in four nights.

_ The Pitts open their second western swing against Butler
at Indianapolis tonight. Coached by Paul “Tony” Hinkle, the

Bulldogs are depending» upon
through a 24 game schedule.
Coach Hinkle favors short
speedy players who are adept
ba1l—handlers. Guards Marion
Fine and George Mingle, both 5
foot, 6 inches tall, are expected
to supply the speed and passing
ﬁnesse. In all previous jousts,

with Butler, the Panthers have

won ﬁve and lost six.
Meet Whiz Kids

It is Illinois who will give the
Carlsonmen their roughest even-
ing. Storm warnings have been
emanating from Champaign where
the famed Whiz. Kids—absent in
the service for two seasons—are
on the rampage. This is the last
season for the heralded four: An-
dy Phillip, Gene Vance, Jack Smi-
ley, and Ken Mienke. _ ‘’

Andy Phillip is rated as the
greatest eager in Illini history. He
won a1l—Conference rating in 1942
and repeated in 1943. Besides
winning al1—American recognition
in 1943, he led the -Western con-
ference in scoring. Aver a 12

points, with a high of 40 points
against Chicago.

In 1943 when the Whiz Kids
weren’t breaking records, they
were setting new ones. They won
the most Conference games in a
two-year span, 25. In two seasons
the four Whiz Kids scored 1329

Carl. Olson, Pitt track coach,
launched his second post-war, a
track season Monday evening at ~
Trees gym. In response to his first 7 *1
call for traclcmen, about 
hopeful spikesters reported for a”'
meeting. This number represents 
only about one-third of the con-
tenders who are expected to re-
port when thé program is in full,

Coach Olson explained to the V
runners that they would hafre to
work under severe handicaps.iThe
old Pitt track house is virtually
unuseable; and, consequently, the ,
Panther speedsters will have to
train under make-shift arrange- *
ments. Practice will be held out- i
side whenever the weather per-T _
mits. On bad days the runners.
will have to make use of the small
track in Trees gym.

Charlie Gongloff, a former Pitt
javalin ace, was on hand to meet

the Pitt athletic staﬁ recently and ', 
will aid Coach Olson in the coach- g
ing of ﬁeld men.
