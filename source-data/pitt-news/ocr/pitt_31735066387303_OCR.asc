Hart  
admits
he was  
unfaithful

By Evans Witt
AP Political Writer

WASHINGTON — Former
Democratic presidential front-
runner Gary Hart declared Tues-
day night he did not plan to re-
enter the 1988 contest and, in an.
extraordinary admission, for the
first time revealed he has been-
unfaithful to his wife.

The former Colorado senator
apologized for "the mistakes that
led" him toquit the race last
May, saying ’'I am totally and ful-
ly responsible for my own actions
and I want. to say to everyone
how sorry I am." , ,

"I’m not a candidate for presi-
dent and I have no plans to be-
come one,” Hart said during a
60-minute appearance on ABC-
TV’s "Nightline." "l am not run-
ning for president.”

"l want to be part of this de-
bate,” Hart said.

’’I do not blame anyone el_se 
I don't blame the press,” Hart‘
said in a statement opening his
long—awaited interview.

Questions about Hart's rela—.
tionship with Miami model Don-
na Rice led to his withdrawal
from the race on May 8. He was
the prohibitive front-runner at the

‘ time.

’'I made a serious mistake. I
should not have been in the com-
pany ofany woman who was not
"a friend of mine 0;; my wife,”
Hart said. '’I should not have
been with Miss Rice.”

Hart refused to answer the
direct question of whether he had
had an affair with Rice, but he ad-
mitted to committing adultery

Co-op plan offers experience

‘By David Ballarotto

Staff Writer

Pitt's School of Engineering has
recently developed a co-

operational program with en-

gineering firms in order to give
students industrial experience.

According to Lori Shuff, Direc-
tor of Freshman Program and Ex-
ternal Affairs, the Cooperative
Education Program will allow stu-
dents to alternate between en-
gineering jobs and to continue
their education.

"Basically students will -work
three, four-month terms in.indus-
try," Shuff said, "And, instead, of
graduating in April, will go until
December of the next year.”

To participate inithe program‘,

students must have a QPA of at

least 2.5 and must also have com- -

pletedthe first two years of their
engineering degree. Students
should submit a transcript and 10
copies of their resume, so the
office can complete a file.

Shuff said that participating
firms will add more student
responsibilities for each subse-
quent term that a student is en-
rolled in the Co-op program.

"One of the reasons for staying
in Co-op," said Shuff,"is it gives

' the students some real-world ex-

perience.”

She added that the co-op pro-
gram allows students to see cur-
rent industrial practices.

"According to Shuff, the pro-

gr; ‘1 differs from an internship
Wl".1"€ firms typicaily take stu-
dents for one term. She said that
under Cooperative Education,
firms are making longer commit-
ments, and students are returning
for more terms.

Under the program, industries
hire two students. "The position__
is continuously being filled be-
tween student A or student B,”
said Shuff.

The program is also ensuring
students the jobsthey take will
actually be related to their major.
Shuff said their office screens ‘in-

. coming job descriptions to make

sure the work is related to en-
gineering,_ and then interested

students are informed of _the~job. .

Shultz says US-Soviets near emigration pact

WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, welcom-
ing a decision in Moscow to grant
exit visas to some Jewish dissi-
dents, said Tuesday the United
States and the Soviet Union were
discussing a ”more humane and
understandable” system for deal-
ing with immigrants and divided

only on a piecemeal basis.

”There are many other refuse-
niks, there are many other peo-
ple who want to emigrate, who
aren't being accorded that right to
which the Soviets have sub-

scribed,” Shultz said.

Reagan says missiles

families.

”We’re Iooking to see if there

aren't some procedures that
could be worked through that
would make this process work
better,” Shultz said in an inter-
view with The Associated Press’
and United Press International.

Preparing after a four-week va-_

cation for a meeting next week
with Edvard A. Schevardnadze,
the Soviet foreign minister, Shultz
called the decision to allow
several prominent Jewish dissi-
dents to leave ’’certainly a wel-
come‘ development on their
part."-

But he voiced exasperation that

Jews and other minorities, as well
as Soviets whose spouses or.fi-
ances live outside the country,
are given permission to depart.

not obstacle to pact

WASHINGTON — The Reagan
administration said Tuesday the
West German Pershing missiles
should not be an obstacle to a
U.S.—Soviet agreement to
eliminate intermediate-range
nuclear weapons.

”Although the Soviets continue
to demand publicly inclusion of
the 72 German rockets in the
Geneva negotiations, we do not
think [the issue] will stand in the
way of an arms control agree-
ment,” said presidential spokes-
man Marlin Fitzwater.

The spokesman said the U.S.
position that the Pershings are not
part of the arms talks is ’’clearly
an issue they [the Soviets] under-
stand. They know our position on

Fitzwater said verification re-

Principal given death
for teacher's murder

HARRISBURG Pa., — Jay C.
Smith, the former high school
principal convicted in the slay-
ings of suburban Philadelphia
schoolteacher Susan Reinert and
her two children, was sentenced
Tuesday to die in Pennsylvania's

electric chair.

In a courtroom filled to capac-
ity, Dauphin County Seniorjudge
William Lipsitt imposed the sen-
tence as Smith stood impassive-
Iy before the bench, his hands
folded in front of him, his attor-
ney standing at his side.

Lipsitt, after rejecting a motion
by Smith to delay the sentencing,
followed the recommendation of
the jury, which had called for the
death sentence after Smith's con-
viction in April 1986.

Pitt's Community Relations
Office of the Department of
Public Safety is sponsoring a
program on personal safety
and asset protection Monday,
Sept. 14 at 7 p.m. in Benedum
Hall. . ‘

The event is specifically
geared toward freshmen and
sophomores, according. to
Sgt.CharIes Grier.

”We want to make them
aware of things like emergen-
cy phones on campus and
give them safety tips for walk-
ing around campus,” he said.

A university crimewatch sys-
tem is currently being or-
ganized, and the discussion at
Benedum will introduce the
idea to Pitt residence hall
students.

”We’re getting the
crimewatch signs ordered for

Campus police to
host safety lecture

the student population at Pitt
to build a sense of communi-
ty in terms of crime preven-
tion,” said.Grier. I

Grier said it is important that
students be alerted to the fact
that the campus phone can be
used for things like medical
emergencies, and that places
like Hillman library are semi-
public and therefore more
prone to criminal incidences.

Campus police are operat-
ing under ”impact detai|”
Thursdays, Fridays and Satur-
days to discourage criminal
activity in the immediate cam-
pus area.

The special enforcement
was established just this year
in response to the problems
that were occuring on the
corner of Forbes and Bouquet
Streets in front of ”The Origi-

' na|” on weekend nights last

fall.

TERTAI NMENT 6

R.E.M. makes a transition on their new album, Document.

Hooters aren't up to potential

The Hooters
One Way Home
Columbia

Perhaps I expected too much.

Nervous Night, the first LP from
the,Philadelphia based Hooters,
was filled with nervous energy.
Almost every song resonated
with vibrant melodies with pun-
chy, catchy lyrics. The album
was a suprise hit, selling over a
million copies. It was an auspi-

cious beginning.

One Way Home is the band's
much awaited follow-up. On the

‘surface,’ not much has changed.

The ”hooter” melodica —- the
band's trademark instrument —
permeates every song. Eric
Bazilian’s mandolin is eerily
haunting on one track then sprite-

ly upbeat on the next. Rob Hy-

man's keyboards are as sound as
ever, and the rest of the band

handle their. instruments with ad-
mirable dexterity.

”Johnny B,” their first single,
seems to be about drug addic-
tion. This is not at all obvious un-
til the song is diagnosed. Lines
like “you're strung out again,”
”her kiss is her poison,” ”forever
inside you, forever it seems” and
“as she drives you home” all
point toward this contention. The
last phrase could be interpreted
to mean that he is taking a trip.
The video for the song supports

' this idea.

”Satellite,” a good bet for a'fu—

ture single, is about television _

evangelism. It's uptempo rythym
is deceiving. It hides the depth

. hidden below.

The best song on the disc,
”Karla with a K," is a tale about

a stormy romance. It is simple but

effective. Another tune that is
worth hooting about IS a number

By Dave Zafris
Staff Writer

With piercing black eyes and a
perky grin seemingly engraved
into her face, she's like a walking,
talking cartoon character.

But Lola Fee is more than ani-
mation. She is a vibrant, energet-
ic, eclectic personality who will
be writing a regular column for
The Pitt News entertainment
section.

What can she offer Pitt stu-
dents? Her witticisms, her charm
and an outspoken dislike for
mainstream, popular music.

”Top:4O music is great if you
have the personality of a dial-
tone," she said with her eyelids
scrunched in disgust. Fee is com-
mitted to enlightening people to
alternative music.

Lola looks pensive as she tries
to name her favorite bands. She
decides the category is too broad
and chooses instead to name her
favorite bands of September. She
spits out The Bambi Slam, Crazy

R.E.M. .
Document
l.R.S. Records

' Along the spine of R.E.M.’s new
album Document, Michael Stipe
has inserted the note ”File Under
Fire.”

Indeed, fire is mentioned in at
least four of the album's 11 songs
and is as close as the band can

"probably come to offering a

unifying concept on Document,
a varied, sometimes unnerving
collection of songs.

After Life’s Rich Pageant gave
R.E.M. their first major commer-
cial breakthrough, the band faced
a great dilemma in recording
their next album. Instead of stay-
ing with Pageanfs slick, direct,
ultra-produced sound, R.E.M. has
followed a route similar to that
taken by U2 when they did The
Unforgettable Fire, and with
equally mixed results.

Many of Document’s songs

have a raw, live-in-the-studio"

sound that adds a playful energy

entitled ”Hard Rockin’ Summer.”
It too is straightforward in its ap-
proach.
The other five tracks are
respectable but not above
reproach. The lyrics sag as does
the melody. There is not much to
them. Several have banal lyrics
that co|lege—educated musicians
should feel embarassed about
writing. _ '
The disappointment that this al-
bum causes is not because.it_is
not quality songwriting —— it is.

The problem is that they can"

clearly do better. There is a lot of
potential in this group that will
hopefully appear later in their
career.

As a whole, though not what it
could be, One Way Home is in-
sightful work with engaging mus-
ic. it is a promising prophecy of
their future in music.

much corporation radio,” she
breathlessly continues.

”The commercial alternative,
W)_(XP [100.7 FM], is a painless
step toward more creative music.

Documentiproves unnerving

to them. But the ”Subterranean
Homesick B|ues”—esque ”lt’s The
End Of The World As We Know
It (And I Feel Fine)” and the '60s-
flavored ”Exhuming McCarthy”
lack punch for all their ex-
huberance.

Far better are a jumping version
of Wire's ”Strange” and the dark,
brooding ”Oddfellows Local
151.”

Document is not without its
glossier—sounding songs, too,
though. In fact,.many of the al-
bum's finest moments come on
songs like the swaying album-
opener ”Finest Worksong” and
the near-lush, engaging “Distur-
bance At The Heron House.”

Some pretty balladry appears
also, with the sax—highlighted
”Fireplace” and the harmony-
rich political tale ”Welcome To
The Occupation” proving most
memorable. ‘

Michael Stipe’s singing is

prominent in the mix of most all
of Document’_s songs, and his lyr-
ics do have some similar themes;

Hooters’ latest album, One Way Home, a disappointment

oves the musicians

Head, The Replacements, Buck- dream! The disc jockeys have

specialty shows of music they
really know and care about.”

Along with alternative radio,
Lola says there are lots of talent-
ed local bands out there waiting
to be heard. .

Although a lot of clubs have
under-21 nights, places like The
Electric Banana, The Decade and
The Graffiti card frequently.

But Fee offers an alternative.

”With the latest hip venue, the
/Squirrel Hill American Legion,

. you don't even have to be 21 !”

Lola said she will write about
alternative music, digging for tid-
bits of information about musi-
cians everywhere. Also, she'll
write dates and news about local
bands.

She offers a message to local
musicians. —

”Take advantage of every
promotional outlet possible. Get
your music on the alternative sta-
tions, get your name in print, post
flyers — but local bands already
know this stuff. It's up to the com-

 

But for all the vaguely political,
topical forays Stipe makes, there
is still plenty of irreverent word-
play and dark poetry for which he
has long been recognized.

Not that he's to be faulted for
covering a lot of ground, but
Stipe’s words add to the album's
apparently decided incon-
sistency. '

Obviously an album contain-
ing so much outstanding materi-
al has to be deemed a success,

.but there is a disjointed, transi-

tional feeling to Document that

leaves one wondering if the next:

truly focused, complete R.E.M. al-
bum will -be the one to follow this
record. A

Just like U2 not wanting to
make another War and recording
The Unforgettable Fire, R.E.M.
has rather successfully shed the
sound of Life’s Rich Pageant on
Document and can hopefully
transform that into even greater
future successes.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9, I987

Headbangers will not like Def Leppard’s solid rock

Def Leppard
Hysteria
Mercury

The question dangling from
rock fans’ pursed lips is this:
”Was the four-year hiatus be-
tween Def Leppard albums
necessary, and was it worth the
wait?”

The answer to that question is
not an easy one. If pinned to a
wall and threatened to have to
listen to the entire Bon Jovi album
collection, I would answer: ”Not
really, they wasted needless
time,” and ”For the most part,
yes.”

The album contains over 60
minutes of rock ’n’ roll. It is mas-
sive in its content, including in it
12 songs, most of which are
good.

They waited four years for a
variety of reasons. Rick Savage,
their drummer, lost an arm in an
auto accident, so they had to de-
vise a specialized drum set for
him. The courage he has shown
in continuing as a drummer is
remarkable.

One problem was trying to
produce the album on their own.
Another was having a producer
who did not work out. The
difficulties, which Leppard claims

were many, are detailed in. a
book entitled Animal Instinct. If
you buy the album you can ord-
er the book. What a bonus!

Although I do not want the
book, the album is worth buying.
It opens up with a song called
”Women” that contains some of
their more libidinal lyrics. It is
solid rock ’n’ roll, but as Pete
Bishop of The Pittsburgh Press
said the headbangers will be dis-
appointed.

”Animal,” ”Rocket” and ”Pour
Some Sugar on Me” are all hard-
rocking but not what would be
considered heavy—metal. Def Lep-
pard is several notches above

what I call wimp-rock groups like
Loverboy, Bon Jovi and Europe.
These musicians are afraid to
offend anyone and end up with
music that is unintersting and
often insipid.

Leppard does not have the
most brilliant lyrics in the world,
but they are intelligent enough
not to include a lyric sheet for the
listener to scoff at. Their strength
is their delivery, and they know
it. As with High and Dry and
Pyromania before it, Hysteria’s
approach is head-o'n.

The album is often an hysteri-
cal unwinding with frenzied ex-
citement. The album never lets

up — not for a minute. it is a con-
tinual assault on the nervous
system.

I respect Def Leppard for the
fact that not one ballad is on this
disc. It is a pleasant change to
have a staccato succession of
music with no filler and no slow-
ing down.

This album is packed with mus-
ic from first to last. it is just what
one would expect from this five-
membered band from Britian.
And just what this critic likes.

More than one partner spoils the sex

Q :I have had many sex part-
ners but never an orgasm with
any of them. When I stimulate
myself, I have no problem reach-
ing orgasm but, in the sex act
with a man, I am aroused and
then turned off. With my present
husband, it has reached the point
that our marriage stops when we
get in bed.

We are both avoiding sex be-
cause of discouragement. This is
complicated by my being in-
volved with another man. We
have gone to sex therapists, but
they always want to talk about
the relationship and never get to

» my actual problem with the act

of sex.

A: You sound, or at least you
write, like a forceful and opinion-
ated woman and that can be part

of your problem, but it will also ‘

help you through to your goal be-

- cause I think you won't give up

trying to reach it.

Many clients have to try a ser-
ies of therapists before finding
one suitable to themselves and
their problem. We sex therapists
have all had clients leave us be-
cause our style was wrong for
them, and we have all had clients

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

come to us after trying other ther-
apists. This is to be expected be-
cause the subject of our work is
so personal that the client and
therapist work best together
when there is a natural rapport.

Or, at least, such rapport is
helpful. I must say that not every
person who needs sex therapy
lives near a colony of sex ther-
apists. Some have to stick with
the one available professional.
But I think you should "persist in
sex therapy, and if you can't shop
around for the right therapist,
then inform the one you have that
you want more sex—performance

work and less relationship inves--

ti g a ti o n .

You were going to a sex ther-
apist and not a psychotherapist?
People have been confused
about this before now.

About your sexual climaxing,
you realize that you are among
the lucky women who do know
how to have orgasms. Starting

with this, you can teach your hus-
band to do for you what you have
done for yourself. This is not
done with chalk and blackboard
but in bed, or wherever you have
sex. It calls for relaxed mutual
communication between you
and your mate, willingness on
both sides to impart and receive
information. ‘

This communication may not
be easy for you two right now.
That may be why the therapist
has wanted to work on relation-
ship problems before trying to
improve sexual performance. Be-
cause unless the partners are on
good terms, mutually helpful, the
lessons and the homework won't
accomplish anything. If you are

' involved with another man, the

married relationship has to suffer
and your sex problem persists.

Let me suggest that, if you
desire sex with men, but are
turned off when it begins, this
may happen because, in your de-
termined head, you are sure it is
going to happen. That may be a
penalty you pay for being so
hard-headed, although that qual-
ity probably serves you well in-
other areas.

Maybe you could leave that
executive brain on the night ta-
ble and surrender to whatever
happens, like an ordinary, sug-
gestible and optimistic person?
You need a good arousing fanta-
sy to have in mind, one that ob-
literates negative ideas. You need
to practice daydreaming. The fact
is that there are more poetry,
music and imagination in human
sex than nuts-and-bolts practi-
cality.

Q: My wedding is coming up,
and I love the girl, and she loves
me. Everything’s cool except that
I have always had premature
ejaculation when having sex with
girls. I am 22, and this has trou-
bled mefor three years. I am sick
of ‘hearing, them say that it

doesn't matter as long as they are
with me. I want to be able to per-
form in bed.

A: Premature ejaculation is the
simplest sexual difficulty to get
rid of. It is a learning disorder,

and there are methods to over-
come it. You may need to go with
your wife to a sex therapist for a
few sessions. The course of this
therapy will not be long, and I
can assure you that you will get
the help you need.

If you are now having sex with
your fiancee, then you and she
can try the method for overcom-
ing premature ejaculation
together. If not, then you should
read a good sex manual about
how to give good foreplay and af-
terplay to insure that you and
your bride have a nice honey-
moon and, if the problem persists
(it may not, with a steady partner
that you get used to), you should
not let it slide but get help.

I sympathize with your wanting
to control your ejaculation, but
you should be glad that those
women wanted to be with you
and that they were nice enough
to tell you so. But please, don't
get the_idea that you are going to
get straightened out with some
other woman and then ride to
your wedding a trained hero with
totally reliable reflexes.

Get the number of your wom-

en down to one, the one you're _

going to rnarry. She, too, wants
to be with you andwill be the
ideal one to help you. This does
not prevent you from being a
hero in her eyes. Many heroes
have had the problem and, if she
knows and understands, then
there will be no pressure on you

to perform, no fear of failure that
.,is almost sure to cause_what you
-fear most.» - .

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9, I987

This tourist’s souvenir was priceless 

Browsing through gift shops on
a recent trip to the Canadian
Niagara Falls, I was amazed at the
number of wildly diverse and
strangely inappropriate items
available for purchase.

I examined laminated wall
decorations, featuring Michael
Jackson, whose Canadian con-
nection I have yet to determine,
and fallen maple leaves suspend-
ed inside cubes of resin, which
make nifty paper weights much
like those I made in eighth-grade
shop class. Had I realized, in
eighth grade, the market potential
for these items (which were sell-
ing for $20 and up, depending
upon the size of the maple leaf
used) I may have immersed my-
self in shop class and bagged Eng-
lish altogether.

But as my array of choices be-
gan to narrow, I, the prototypical
tourist, was faced with a mind-
bending dilemma. ‘Should I pur-
chase the $400 Indian soapstone
sculpture of the drowsy Eskimo,
which I truly liked, or do I go the
more economical route with the
ceramic cheetah for a modest
$47.50?

After an agonizing period of
consideration —— visualizing each
piece of art as it might appear
upon a wooden mantel and im-
agining stories I could tell about
the personal significance of each
object — my choice was made.
I chose neither.

First, the $400 soapstone sculp-
ture, nice as it was, most likely
was purchased from a poor but
talented Indian artist for about 40
bucks. I. have nothing against
retailing per se, but markups do
have their limits. Perhaps one

day, I'll travel to Northern Cana-

home._ Run away! You have no
idea what's in store for you. Drop
all of your plans and flee. This is
your last chance.

Permit me to break this to you
gently. Life at Pitt is nothing like
your mentors led you to believe.
They fed you an illusion to pro-
tect you from the-shock of reali-
ty. Pitt is like a prostitute. You pay

Most of you little wretches

sexually segregated, artificial en-

room is the size and shape of a

chump are each getting zapped
over $230 a month to share your
airtight cell. If you open the win-
dow, some snitch will fine you.
That's silly, why would you want
to breathe fresh air? If you don't
know what getting "pennied” in
your room means, you'll proba-

da, findtanlndian artist and offer
him or her $100 for a similar
sculpture. The artist will be 60
bucks ahead, and I will have
spent, including transportation
costs, the same $400 and have
seen, most likely, a more beauti-
ful and representative part of
Canada. This brings me to point
number two.

Throughout my Canadian trav-
els, though I had scanned the
landscape for evidence, I had
seen no sign of the native Cana-
dian cheetah. Neither in Niagara
Falls nor in the wilds of Toronto.
Though it remained possible that
the cheetah was indigenous to
either Montreal or Quebec City,
two places I have yet to visit, I

~ decided that the whole_thing was

probably a hoax devised by am-
bitious ceramics dealers to dupe
unsuspecting Americans, and I
called it a day.

The next morning, my com-
panion and I rose early to catch
a motorcoach tour of Niagara

 

Parks. The barker, who had
flagged us down a few days earli-
er and talked us into the trip
(which cost us $14 each), ex-
plained that such a tour would
provide the best means possible
for experiencing the beauty of the
parks and majesty of the falls
themselves. We believed him.

Due to the stormy weather of

that morning, the bus was, at
most, half full. This didn't bother
me. The misanthrope in me tends
to surface in tourist areas. Putting
‘my gift—buying dilemma to rest for
a while, I shifted my attention
toward my fellow tourists and,
specifically, toward a middle-
aged African couple.

As the tour moved on, the cou-
ple seemed to become increas-
ingly bored by the sights and
oblivious to the kindly banter of
the tour guide. Throughout the
three-hour, seven-stop " trek,
which really did prove to be the
best way to see everything
(though not for very long), the
African couple ventured from the
bus only twice, and I think once
was for coffee. I thought to my-
self, "Being from Africa, surely
they must be hip to the~who|e
Canadian cheetah scam. But he's
wearing a Disneyland--(shirt. I'll
bet they're looking for a good
restaurant and anything with
Michael Jackson on it." At that
point, the whole gift—shop trip
started to make sense to me.

As weitook in the sights —- from
the gorgeous flpral clock to the
treacherous Niagara Spanish
Aero Car ride that extends over
the Niagara Whirlpool — I was
taken by a feeling of sadness. It
seemed the natural splendor of
Niagara Falls had been trans-

 

formed into something akin to” 3’
Coney Island. I kept imagining ’ 
what it must have been like when 

the park opened 100 years ago

(as of next year) — before the 
nightime illumination of the falls, . V
before the Elvis Presley Museum, , 

and before That's Incredible! and
Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

Couldn't we all .live a little bet- .-
ter, or at least no worse, with_out_ 

these things? i . —

Descending 230 feet by eleva- I

ly hooked up with Mother Na-

ment, those falls and that river ,

Jackson combined. ‘ I

The following day, after slip-
ping into rain gear at the dock
and taking the boat ride to the
base of the falls on the ”Maid of
the Mist,” I realized this. Nothing
else in the area really matters.
The falls are it. The boat ride,
which cost around five bucks,

was the least expensive activity of - f 

the entire trip, and yet it was the
essence of the entire trip. Without
it, there would have been little
reason to leave home.

Ken Russell and a series of eight
films about composers are
offered. »

Russell's featured films are rich
and varied in subject from a rock
musical and a spy story. to a
chiller. Many link this director to
Altered States, the 1980 hit, in
which William Hurt makes his
debut as the research scientist
whose experiments with hal-
lucinogens run wild. Russell also
directed Tommy, the 1975 rock
opera by The Who that features
Roger Daltry and Elton John.
Although visually stunning, this
piece was criticized as stylistic
narcissism.

Not all of Russell's nearly 20
films have been broad and popu-
lar successess. The Devils, a sto-
ry of possessed nuns in the 17th
century, was considered con-
troversial when released in 1971.

Russell pays tribute to the mu-
sicals of the '20s and '30s in The
Boyfriend. It features original
music by Sandy Wilson and stars
Twiggy. Women In Loveis a love
story of two couples in a beauti-
ful 1920's setting. Rudolph
Nureyev plays the title role in

life and work of American com-
poser Charles lves and avant-

THE PITT NEWS

Gadsonproves himself
in long test of mobility  

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

The times may be a changin’,
but for now, things are staying

perfectly stable for linebacker’

Ezekial Gadson.

Gadson, who it seems has been
moved _more times than a U—Haul
trailer, may have found his spot
this season for good.

The 6—foot—1, 210-pound senior
from Frogmore, S.C., was origi-
nally recruited to the Pitt Panther
football team as a tailback. But
last season, head coach Mike
Gottfried’s first in Pittsburgh,
Gadson was moved from offense
to defense in the linebacker po-
sition.

And just last summer, it
seemed Gottfried would again
move him back to tailback.
However, Gottfried said he want-
ed to go with a hunch and keep
Gadson in the defense and try
one of his new freshman recruits
to join Craig Heyward in the tail-
back slot. ’

That hunch proved more than
valuable.

In last Wednesday's game v_er-
sus Brigham Young, Gadson
proved more than valuable.

”I found out what I wanted to
in last week's game,” said Gott-
fried. ”Zeke proved to me what
kind of a football player he real-
ly is, and I don't think heyonly

proved it to me and the rest of the
coaches —- he proved it to
himself.”

- This.proof stands alone in Gad-
son's one—game stats — 12 tack-
les, all unassisted, two hurries,
one blocked kick and four sacks.
Not bad for someone who wasn't
”all that comfortable" with the
position just a few months ago.

But, even Gadson himself now
feels he has found his own niche
within the gridiron.

”I think I'm back at home now,
and I’m going to stay here,” said
Gadson. ”I never played defense
all that much, and I never really
concentrated that much on it be-
cause it just wasn't my position.
But now that I'm in this position,
I'm able to concentrate more and
more, and I think I'll be able to
give more to the team because I
now know both offense and
defense."

But it goes deeper than this.

”The position I'm in is "a lot
more relaxed,” Gadson con-
tinued. ”I’m a lot more comfort-
able with it. I'm allowed to blitz
a lot more, and that's basically
my style. The more relaxed you
are when you play, the more fun
you can have. Kind of like play-
ing with a lot of reckless abandon
without getting penalized.”

Although‘ the last statement
would probably make Gottfried
squint a little, he now sees what

‘By Vince Longo

For The Pitt_ News

Agonizing. Thrilling. Elusive.
These are words which describe
the quest for college football's na-
tional championship.

Pitt has nine championships to
their name.- Will they have
another in 1987?

Your guess is probably as good
as mine, provided you know at
least a little bit about college
football. _

The point is, picking a pre-
season Top 10 is an educated
guess at best. Anyway, here is a
brief preview of what I believe to
be the .1 0 best teams in the land.

No. 1 Oklahoma -1 know it's
boring to pick Oklahoma» be-

‘ cause everybody picks Oklaho-

ma. I swear I wanted to make
Clemson number one, but the
Sooners are so powerful and their
schedule so weak that I had no
choice.

Fifteen starters return to a team
that should make a habit of post-
ing scores like Sept. 5th’s 69-14
win over North Texas State.

Option QB ”Jammin” Jamelle,
Holieway and All-America tight
lead the
offense while Dante Jones will
replace Bosworth as the leader of
the defense.

No. 2 Clemson 5 All-America
guard John Phillips is one of nine

starters who return along the ‘

offensive and defensive lines_ for

the Tigers.

The defense is led by Michael
Dean Perry, the Refrigerator’s lit-
tle brother, who ‘weighs in at a
healthy 270 pounds.

A sizeable advantage for the
Tigers this season could be their
schedule. Clemson plays eight
home games in the 79,854-seat
Death Valley Stadium, including
their toughest contest against
Georgia.

No. 3 Miami —- The ’Canes.

return nine starters from a defense
that was ranked fifth nationally in
1986 and held Penn St. to 14
points in the.Fiesta Bowl.

Defensive end Dan Stubbs an-
chors the line while All-America
safety Bennie Blades patrols the
defensive backfield.

The player to ‘watch is QB
Steve Walsh, who had a Kelly-
Kosar—Testaverde-like game
against Florida September 5 in
completing 17 of 27 passes for
234 yards.

Miami's schedule is weak and
they play eight games at home.
The home field advantage is
negligible since only 35,000 or
so show up for most home
games.

No. 4 Florida State — The
choice team for the independents
just may be upstate in Tallahas-
see, where the Seminoles return
a whopping, 17 starters from last
year's 6-4-1 team.

The star of the traditionally

"offensive-minded team is defen-

  

he had hoped to and agrees with
Gadson that he is at home in the
linebacker spot. .

”I think he had been all along,”
said Gottfried. ”He’s the kind of
football player we'd been both
wanting and needing and here
we had him all. along.

”The best part about him in-the

linebacker position is" that he_

makes tackles not just in central-
ized spots but goes from sideline
to sideline,” said Gottfried. ”|t’s
his speed that enableshim to do
this, and that's agreat asset to any
team.” ‘

Even though it is only the be-
ginning of the season, last week's
game can be used as quite a
predictor of what is yet to come
from Gadson. But he said he
won't let it go to his head.

’’I never thought I would ever
be able to see a game like I had,
and I don't really know just how
I did it, although I'm glad I did.
I have to try‘ and maintain that
same type of play and then build
upon it and get better.

”If they [opponents] will con-
centrate on me, then it leaves
more room open for others to get

. through and do the job.

’’All I have_to do is concentrate
and keep my faith in God, and
the job will get done. And I know
I can do it.”

The more things change, -the
more they stay the same.

ol prove

  ANA|.vsIs

sive back Deion Sanders, who
just may be the best at his po-
sition.

The Seminoles play a light-
weight schedule that includes
such powerhouses as East Caro-
lina," Memphis State, Louisville,
Tulane and Furman.

No. 5 Auburn —-Just as in re-
cent years, the ‘best team in
football-crazed Alabama is not
Alabama, but Auburn.

Tackle Tracy Rocker isone of
nine returning regulars on a
defense that finished second in
the nation last year in scoring
defense, giving up just over 10
points per game.

On_offense, QB Jeff Burger is
more than adequate, while the
replacement for Brent Fullwood
at running back, James ”Bo
Peep”'Joseph is questionable.

As the concept of the United
States of America is well on its

- way of progressing through a

third century, the term ”Sold
American” becomes more dee-
ply rooted in 'world cons-
ciousness. -

What this term means is some-

’ thing that has either evolved from

or adhered itself solely to that
which is considered American

‘ culture in its purest form.

Examples would be the hula
hoop, rock’n’roll, or the pet rock,
if you can remember back to the
glorious '70s and the days of the
bicentennial and the hustle.

But there is one trend, albeit

-obsessive goal, that is, pardon,

sold American.

Thinness.

Never will you see a Calvin
Klein or Gloria Vanderbilt adver-
tisement with, instead of svelte
and toned, streamlined torsos
basking in the sun, a couple of
slightly hefty farm bodies munch-
ing down some Fritos or pigging
out at the local pizza parlor or
fried chicken establishment. Not
once will you spy a TV commer-
cial with someone who has con-

siderable girth dancing in the
latest fad disco (that's still what
they are, only now they're
referred to as dance clubs) push-
ing the newest beer or cologne.

Basically, you'll never find a fat
slob endorsing anything directed
at the ”new generation.”

And the only time fat ever be-
comes acceptable is when it is
treated with, at best, reserved hu-
mor, such as the cases of Chica-
go Bear William
Refrigerator” Perry or come-
dienne Rosanne Barr.

Well folks, this pastime of"

criticizing excess bulk has now
infiltrated the ranks of the Pitt
Panther football team.
More precisely, one player.
Most precisely, Craig Heyward.
Everyone who knows anything
about Pitt football knows the size

of lronhead. At circa 260 pounds "
but .

(supposedly inaccurate,
who's counting), he is undoubt-
edly the powerhouse behind any
of the Panthers’ offensive force.

But whenever his name is
brought into focus ineither a
professional or coctail—party at-
mosphere, his persona becomes

”The.

 

cnnnsropman
SEPESY

a paradox. On one hand, he is
referred to as ”a force that is un-
stoppable,” ”like trying to stop a
locomotive” or ”truly one of ‘
Pitt's finest players.”

But, when you turn around,
you'll hear him referred to (and
sometimes from the same people)
as ”that great big tub of goo” or
”that fat-ass who needs to lose
weight because it just doesn't’
look good for the team.” I

OK, which is he? A specimen

 

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9, 1987

of the best of what college foot-
ball can offer, or one that shows
what happens when you have
one too many Whoppers? A gi-
ant, or a glutton?

‘At a press conference yester-
day, directly after he had given a
prospectus concerning this
weekend's upcoming game
against the Wolf Pack of North
Carolina State, Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried, who recently
shed 48 pounds himself, was
asked to comment about the cur-
rent status of Heyward’s weight.
The question itself was met with
chuckles from several members
of the audience.

”Well, somehow I just got tired
of asking, and as long as he can
keep up what he's been doing,
we'll just monitor what he eats-,”
said Gottfried. I

But Gottfried went on to say

_something very revealing.

.”He’s not as fat as some peo-
ple think he is. lf you look at him,
he's solidly built. There's really
not a lot of fat on him.”

Now, in case you missed it, the
key words in the above-quoted
paragraph are ’’solidly built.”

~Of Cabbages and Ding-dongs: fat in sports

This means muscle. Muscle me-
ans stregnth. Strength means
power.

Power means wins.

There are some people who for
health reasons need to lose
weight — sometimes a little,
sometimes a lot. But, if what Dr.
Freddie Fu tells us is correct, this
is not Heyward’s case.

Who cares if Heyward has
some excess baggage to carry
around! Somehow it onlyseems
to make him more ominous to
the opposition. And, I doubt
those who are so quick to criti-
cize and call him a lardo would
stand pat as he was charging
down a field at them at top speed.

Heyward himself seems to treat
his situation with humor. ”Peo—
ple look at me and see how big
I am and don't think I can run that
fast,” he said. ’’I like to surprise
them!”

On that note, I think I'll go
home and throw away all my Lite

Knox’s Seahawk

By Tom Danyluk

Staff Writer

Let it be understood that things

have been getting rather simple"

in the NFL these days. From 1981
on, 49ers, Redskins, Bears, Giants
— all straight shots from NFC
doormats to division leaders to
dynasties. Oooh, there's that foul
word again. But what the heck,
everybody else bounces it around
like a beachball after each Super
Bowl massacre, so if you can't
beat ’em, just make like the Jets
and call it quits. Or make like the
Cards and Bucs and call it the
pits, -
Whateveryou choose to call it,
calling the 1987 AFC and NFC
champions won't be that easy of
a task. With the overall lack of
game-breaking talent available in
this year's draft, the rich will only
get slightly richer, and the poor
will hardly break even as incum-
bents in the a|so—ran candidacy.
Sorry Packers and Bills fans —
Vinnie is in Tampa and the B02
is in Seattle. And Super Bowl XXII
is where those Seahawks, as well
as the resurgent Washington Red-
skins will be. Read on and find
out who, what, when, where and
why‘ in professional football as
Dr. D presents‘ The Pitt News’
1987 NFL Preview.

The AFC East

Two years ago, when nostalgia-
loving, baby-booming disc-
jockeys played ”Da _Do Run
Run” on WN FL, it was typically

followed by a pulling rendition of

”Weekend in New England,”
regional home of those New En-
gland Patriots. The bruising bar-

. rage of Craigjames, Mosi Tatupu,

Tony Collins and Robert
Weathers led the Patriots unex-
pected charge to Super Bowl XX.

But the old days are gone, and
1986 is certainly better left alone,
as the Pats ranked dead last in the
league in rushing offense (85.8
yards per game). The retirement
of perennial all—pro guard John
Hannah two seasons ago didn't
help matters much, but New En-
gland finally traded for a respec-
table replacement in Tampa’s
Sean Farrell.

So, if the running game straight-

_ ens out, New England is solid

enough everywhere else to make
an excellent run at the AFC
crown, 10-5-1.

A ‘meaningless, harmless,
preseason match with the Chica-
go Bears somehow became Don
Shula’s second worst nightmare
of all-time (next to losing Larry
Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul
Warfield to the WFL in 1974).
The Miami Dolphins lost Boeing
747 quarterbackDan Marino and
second-year linebacking sensa-

(412)
976-

7070

Six bucks plus (all ii any.

tion John Offerdahl in one cheap
sweep of fate’s forearm. Offer-
dahl could be lost for the year,
although Marino should be
around for the team's opener
against New England.

Yet even with Marino and
Offerdahl, Miami has an abun-
dance of glaring weaknesses:
poor pass rush, poor run defense,
poor pass defense (which pretty
much covers the entire defense)
and a poor rushing offense. Much
more than a new stadium — Mi-
ami has moved into the posh Joe
Robbie complex, abandoning the
age-old Orange Bowl — is need-
ed to squeak Shula’s team into
the playoffs this year. 9-7.

The foundation has been laid,
uh, rather, purchased, and now
Buffalo Bills head coach Marv
Levy has some construction work
ahead of him. In quarterbackJim
Kelly, the Bills h-ave one of the
league's best passers; in all
eleven starters, Buffalo has one of
the league's worst fourth-quarter
defenses, yielding a whopping
115 points in that crucial final
period. Ten of their 12 losses
were by less than 11 points, and
four mid-season defeats were by
a combined total of 11 points.
Also, the Bills forced only 18 tur-
novers last year, worst in the
league. Rookie LB Shane Conlan
is a sure step in the right direc-
tion, but it will be a while before
Buffalo makes any significant
move upward. 6-9-1.

Ask not for whom the bell tolls;
it tolls for thee, New York Jets.
Can you sense the mounting tur-
moil on that club? The Jets,
despite some key injuries, fizzled

' embarassingly over the last five

games of the season, then quit in
the last five minutes of their

I playoff loss to Brown/s. And there

is no real reason to believe the
descent won't continue in 1987.
Broken—spirited QB Ken O'Brien
held out of camp for more
money, Mark Gastineau fired

s olesTined

degrading remarks concerning
the team's character, and the Jets’
draft was about as attractive as
the mystical loony in the rainbow
wig who somehow always finds
his way into the endzone seats of
NFL games. If New York doesn't
start off exceptionally strong, look

‘ for owner Leon Hess to start hint-

ing about axing his head coach,
Joe Walton and really foul things
up. 6-10.

Believe it or not, the Indi-
anapolis Colts come into 1987
riding on a winning streak of
three games that carries over from
last season. Yeah, but if you think
about it, big deal. These are still
the Colts, a.k.a. the Dolts, the
NFL’s version of the North-
western Wildcats.

Can

One position where the team
would be exceptionally dominat-
ing is at linebacker; that is, if the
ownership can ever sign the
Original Alabama Slammer, hold-
out Cornelius Bennett. Veterans

Johnie Cooks, Duane Bickett and-

Barry Krauss are quietly among
the league's best trios. .

The Colts needed a full season
out of QB and injury-king Gary
Hogeboom, but he tore thumb
ligaments in a preseason struggle
with Houston and is out in-
definitely. That leaves the posi-
tion to shaky Jack Trudeau. Also,
a little consistency in the defen-

— sive backfield is a must before ”-

olts” is once again preceeded by
a ”C,” not a ”D”. See? 5-11.
The AFC Central
Everybody’s talking Cleveland,
Cleveland, Cleveland this year,
so that's why the choice in the

-.

weird AFC Central is the Cincin-
nati Bengals. Coach Sam Wyche
has an extremely explosive offen-
sive unit working for him, led by
QB Boomer Esiason, WRs Chris
Collinsworth, Eddie Brown and
Tim McGee and tailback James
Brooks. Cincinnati piled up near-
ly 6,000 yards last year, averag-
ing an impressive 6.2 yards per
play. Draftwise, the Bengals did
a nice job in patching up some
glaring defensive holes, snagging
two ends and two cornerbacks in
the first four rounds. Still, the line-
backers leave much to be
desired, aside from ironman Reg-

gie Williams. Look for second- .

year LB Joe Kelly to put his foot
down this season. Somebody had
better, or Wyche, who frequent-

' ly feuds with Esiason the Fran-
J chiser, will be outta there if the

talented Bengals don't do some
serious winning. 11-5.

Okay, now it's the Cleveland
Browns’ turn. After coming to wi-
thin 3 points of the Super Bowl
last season, the Browns are pret-
ty much everyone’s choice to
represent the AFC this year. But,
can a team that shipped out its
best defensive player — LB Chip
Banks was traded to San Diego

’ on draft day — still be that won-

derful to fight all the way to the
Super Bowl, especially when the
game's name nowadays is D.
Fense? Hard tosay. The Browns
took a big chance in the first

round going after a relative-

unknown Duke linebacker Mike
Junkin

Bernie Kosar is expected to
have another exceptional season
at quarterback, but he needs both

    

Kevin Mack and Ernest Byner,

Cleveland's best running backs,_ _
to stay healthy all season. Last:

year, with Mack and Byner in-
jured, the Browns’ offense wasn't
all that difficult to predict — ”Ko-
sar drops back, he looks left, he
throws ...” 10-6. A
So what's new with the Pitts-

burgh Steelers this year? Well, 

they drafted some_ interesting
wide receivers in Charles Lockett

and_Joey Clinksca|es_. They draft-. ‘ i 1

ed some very interesting defen-
sive backs in Delton Hall,

Thomas Everett, and the ever- 

missing Rod Woodson. They 

They  uh, They... That's about ‘ H;

it. Good news for,Steeler fans on
the vets is that RB Ernest Jackson
will be around for a whole sea-
son, and backs Frank Pollard and
Walter Abercrombie are relativ-
ley healthy. Monster guard John
Reinstra, who missed the last 10
games of '86 with a broken foot,
is looking fabulous, a potential
Pro-Bowler. So for the Steelers,

it's the same old story. Too many_  
teams are improving in too many,

places for Pittsburgh to finish

above .500. Until the new guys" i

come around  6-10.

more talented prospects: RB
Alonzo Highsmith, WR Hay-
wood Jeffries, even fifth-round
selection Spencer Tillman, could
all be impact players. Says Glan-
ville, ”We’ve got enough players
who love their mamas. We're
looking for a few who don't. In
fact, we'd like to find a few play-
ers who don’t even know who
their mamas are.” The Houston
Mamas Boys  Has a nice, ap-
propriate ring to it. 5-11.

The AFC West

No questions asked — the Seat-
tle Seahawks will be the team to
beat in the '87 AFC. Most
analysts agreed that the lineback-
ing corps was the major defen-
sive softspot for the team, one
that would most likely keep
Chuck Knox’s troops out of the
Super Bowl. Well, the Seahawks
took care of that problem, and in
a big way. Over the summer,
Seattle inked two of the finest col-
lege ’backers in the land — Bri-
an Bosworth of Oklahoma and
Tony Woods of Pitt.

,Offensively, ‘QB Dave Krieg
needs to be a much more consis-
tent leader. In 1986, after direct-
ing the team to a 5-2 record,
Krieg slumped badly as the Sea-
hawks went into a four—loss tail-
spin. That ultimately kept the
team out of the playoffs. Not this
year. 13-3.

For the Los Angeles Raiders,

1986 was nothing more than pro-

footba|l’s version of ”Down and
Out in Beverly Hills.” Not that an
8-8 record is a complete disaster,
but don't try telling owner Al Da-
vis that. What kills the Raiders is
the lack of a solid quarterback. In
1987, untested Rusty Hilger, . a

' second-year man from Oklahoma

State, will be behind center for
Los Angeles, throwing to a hot
new set of wide receivers. Swer-
vin.’ Mervyn Fernandez was im-
ported from Canada and James
Lofton was rescued from Green
Bay. The L.A. air attack could
once again be quite dangerous.
Just like the Raider defense. 10-6.

Was the AFC that bad last year,

‘bad enough that the Denver

Broncos,_ the team that Elway and

"Elway alone built, represented

the conference in the Super Bowl

last year, only to become dis-
membered by the Giants in a
39-20 second—ha|f laugher?
Jeeeeez, it was bad. Denver has
a weak running game, a medi-
ocre pass rush, and unimpressive
linebackers (aside from Karl
Mecklenberg). The Broncos
reached the Super Bowl on guts
and determination and QB El-
way’s Winchester arm. It won't
be enough in the improved AFC
this time around. 9-7. 4

Put it this way — theKansas
City Chiefs will either be

A devastating or the_flounder of the

AFC West. After reaching the
playoffs for the first time in 15
years, KC fired head coach John
Mackovic, replacing him with
special teams coach Frank Gansz.
Sad" thing for Gansz is that his
choice of who will quarterback
the team is pinned between a
hard, hard place and a rock. And
rocks areexactly what Bill Ken-
ney and Todd Blackledge throw
—— bricks, concretechunks. Cer-
tainly not a strong spot on the
team. The Chiefs snared running
backs Paul Palmer and Christian
Okoye in the draft, so that area
should improve. The secondary
and defensive line are awesome,
the special teams demonic, and
the linebackers bordering on
poor. I don't know. This team is
just too hard to figure out, so 
8-8.

Defense, defense, defense.
That's what the ‘San Diego Charg-
ers needed and still need to be-
come a contender. So who do
they draft as their number one
selection? Rod Bernstein, a tight

end out of Texas A&M. Not an »

immediate need, guys. Charger
opponents converted on third
down 42-percent of the time last
year, averaged nearly 350 yards
per contest. And they draft a tight
end. Newly acquired linebacker
Chip Banks will help the situation

immediately, as will rookie cor-'

nerback Lou Brock of USC. But
the team's best pass rusher, DE
Leslie O’Neal, could become the
team's best ex—pass rusher, due to
a severe knee injury suffered late
last season. He may never play
again. And San Diego went
ahead and drafted a tight end.
5-11. 1
Next, the NFC.
