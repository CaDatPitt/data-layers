Dr. Peake
Gives View

On Frick

There is nothing unusual in the
new Frick Arts Building sched-
uling mainly ﬁne arts and other
humanities courses to meet in its
classrooms, according to Vice-
Chancellor of the Academic Dis-
ciplines Charles H. Peake.

In a statement prepared for
The Pitt News, Peake explained
that “the priority given to hu-
manities classes in the Henry
Clay .Frick' Fine Arts Building
was simply part of a whole series
of understandings between Miss
Frick and the University regard-
ing the use and administration
of the Building.”

Peake emphasized that “there
is nothing whatever unusual
about establishing priorities for
campus buildings, either here or
«at other institutions. The natural
science division has priority in
science buildings, engineering in
the engineering building, and
public health in its building.”

Commenting on the reschedul-

ing of classes in 'the_,F_‘ine_ ,A_1ftS__,

Building, ‘Virginia Lewis, assis-

tant director of the building, said

these moves were instituted be-

cause too many courses were

scheduled for the building and

“it was decided to take some

classes out to make it less»:
crowded.”

Miss Lewis added that it was
“unfair to Miss Frick” to assume
that changes were made because
Miss Frick wanted only ﬁne arts
courses in the building. She em-
phasized that the building is also
open to the community in the
afternoon and needed the room
for that purpose.”

Coffee House  
Makes Debut

Near Campus

A version of the European
student coffee houses, long
time a favorite on that conti-
nent, will make its debut in
the Pittsburgh area this F'ri-
day at the Lutheran Univer-
sity Center, 4515 Forbes
Ave. (between Craig and
Dithridge Sts.). The Crumb-
ling Wall, asthe coffee house
will be called, will operate
from 9 pm‘. to 1 a.m. every
Friday. _ I

Women dormitory residents willhave new curfews be
ginning this Friday, according to Janet Berson, ﬁrst vice
president of Associated Women Students (AWS) in charg

of Housing Board.

Women will be eligible for the new hours on the the
of credits earned. Classiﬁcations are as follows: freshmen

‘with fewer than 24 credits and
in their ﬁrst two terms at the
University; students with 74
credits or less, all sophomores
and some juniors; and those who
have earned 75 credits or more,
some juniors and all seniors. This
is essentially the same as present
classiﬁcations.

The changes in curfew laws
depend on these classiﬁcations.
Women with 74 credits or less
will be given four additional
hours or '16 quarter hours a
month, and women with 75 cred-
its or more will receive eight ad-

' ditional hours or 32 quarter hours
a month. '

The new _curfew regulations
were introduced to housing board
during spring trimester by Toby
Sandler, acting chairman of
Housing Board, and Marjorie
Gelb, spring vice- president of
Brackenridge House. With the as-

- sistance of Mrs. Sandra Lenthall

and Mrs. Anne Ginevan, head
residents of Holland. Hall and
Tower C, respectively, research
was done on the University's sys-‘

tem and other college culffew._

lsystems.

Regular meetings weréheld to I

work the quarter hour system
into the program. The new sys-
tem was presented and passed by
acclamation at last Thursday’s
Housing Board meeting. A
Base-time-curfew (BTC), or the

curfew without using quarter

hour permissions, will be 11 p.m.
for freshmen, and midnight for
other women Monday through
Thursday. BTC Friday and Sat-
urday -nights will be 1:30 a.m.;
Sunday night curfews remain the
sarffe, 10:30 p.m. with two 12:30
permissions a ‘trimester for trav-
eling. Quarter hours may not be
used on Sundays.

Quarter hours may be used in
any way the student. chooses
without exceeding the maximum
curfew‘ of 12:30 a.m. Monday
through Thursday and 2:30 a.m.

1 Friday and Saturday.

For example, if a ' girl has a
1:30 a.m. curfew on Friday night.
and returns to her dormitory at
2:10 a.m. she has used up three
quarter hours since any part of
a 15 minute interval is consider-
ed'a complete quarter hour.

If a student signs out .at 8:30
p.m. with an expected return of
2:30 a.m. and returns to her
dormitory at 2 a.m. she has used
only two quarter hours.

A coed should not always “sign

‘Editor, The Pitt News:
By painting the bleak picture
(if Student Government as you

leading the students astray. Many
students get the impression that
tudent Government is a void-
lacking both responsible leader-
ip and participation. This is
not entirely true.
_Tr'ue, there is a large faction
‘ft the Senatelwhich, under the
guise of‘ certain “principles,’_’ re-
tards progress. True there may
some irresponsible action and
statements on the part of a few

pointed out that there are people
in/' Student Government who de-

 example of this is our stand

dent Government lose all control
over ’ the student activities fee,
but it might delay allocation of

times before, wants Student Gov-

Editor, The Pitt News: -
I I attended the recent Student
Government meeting; it was my
rst. It was eventful, colorful,
xcitirig, and very, very long. But
t’ was an important meeting, I
‘hink, and as a freshman stu-
bent I would like to express my

‘own impressions of what hap-
..pened.

I have no unmitigated praise or

"condemnation for anyone. There

was a sharp division between the

isenators as to what the respon-
sibilities of the Student Govern-

ment should be. -Speakers on both

ﬂsides were, at times, eloquent.
,':S_peakers on both sides presented
;-arguments on legality and con-
stitutionality, and the arguments
jof both sides were well made. In

he passion of‘ commitment and

heat of debate some things were

:said. which, perhaps, should not

 Leta.   To   at an.   

    

  

have been said; for this, too, both
sides share responsibility.

When all the rhetoric, thunder,
and elaboration are taken away,
however, it all seems to have
boiled down to this: some of the
senators argued that the Student
Government should attempt to
function as a significant represen-
tative governing body of, by, and
for the students at Pitt; some
senators argued that the Student
Government should abide by the
rules setdown by the administra-
tion of the university.

What a shame that these two
things are incompatible!

What concerned me most, how-
ever, was one of the arguments
——voiced more than once—by
those who helped defeat the mo-
tion which would have set the
problem before the student body
through a referendum. The argu-
ment was this: the majority of

the students are not responsible *

enough, or intelligent enough, or
concerned enough (“the students
don't care”) to make a rational
decision, after all facts and argu-
ments have_ been presented, over
how their activity fees are to be
handled. _

This, I believe, is a falsehood.
It is, too, an expression of con-
tempt by representatives of the
represented, and I think it is an
attitude which is unworthy of
any member of a democratic
bod_y.tI sincerely hope this is not
an attitude which is unanimously
held by the majority which voted
against the referendum.

Student Disputes
Views of Liberal

Editor, The Pitt News:

- I wish to take issue with the
quotes attributed to Irv Garﬁn-
kle in the Sept. 20 Pitt News. Gar-
flnkle has always maintained that
he is a liberal; but, as quoted’ in
The Pitt News he sounds like a
national ‘socialist.

He feels that the student body
at Pitt should get involved in the
King’s Court controversy. I al-
ways , thought that liberals be-
lieved in free collective bargain-
ing. The issue of non-union proj-
ectionist is one for the manage-

\'ment of the King’s Court and the

union concerned to decide; the

union is already exercising its-

prerogative by picketing. It is ‘not
a matter for the student body

at Pitt to decide. . /-

As to the matter of price, it
would seem that the. management
of the King’s Court feels that
their elaborate decorations war-
rant the extra money. If we don’t
like the prices, we don’t have to
go to the King’s Court. If the
King’s Court finds that people
will not pay their price, the price
will come down.

It seems that Garﬁnkle is more -

interested in gaining power for
students, than helping people. If
a student wants to make his in-
ﬂuence felt, he should join the
Young Republicans or Young

  An Old Tale of Greek Youth

while the tale of the travelers to Ar-  

metes is one about people of ancient Greek
islands, the lesson it has to offer is appli-
cable to men and women of our age.

The land of Armetes was renowned as
an isle rich with gold,silver, and other valu-
able ores. But by a common agreement be-

; ’ ' - "I “ I tween the elders of the
. surrounding lands on-

ly the most able and

intelligent young men

were given the_right

to Search for these

treasure; on the isle.
. Whenthe youths of
- A. the /neighboring lands
FRANK were in their late
teens they went through a series of both
physical and mental tests to prove them-
selves worthy of this privilege.

THEN IN the fall of their eighteenth

  
   

year -these most fit gathered on the shores *

of their homelands and began to travel by
boat to Armetes-

These poorer islands couldafford to give

their sons; only small and flimsy boats. Thus
the ride to Armetes was by far the greatest
test that the young menwere put through.
While before they had only to throw the
discus or answer questions on logic, now
they had to try to guide their light and

crowded crafts through turbulent waters. ’

It was generally accepted by all that
there was no greater test that men could be
_put through then trying to complete the
voyage to Armetes. The trip was believed
to be the’ roughest anywhere in the seas,

AT LEAST once during the voyage,
though, another -ship passed the vessel of
the young travelers. This was a much larg-
er ship, sturdier and with navigators who
knew well the rough seas surrounding Ar-
metes. , /

Upon the greatest vessels were always
men who were on their third or fourth trip
, to Armetves. These men had learned from

their first trips and grown wise. T-hey knew ’

how horrible the passage could be and they
were filled with compassion as the novices
struggled aboard the smaller craft. '

It had " become reverred and respected
custom that as the two vessels neared each
other the older men wouldboard the smaller

craft. “Abandon your ship” the elders would 

say. In years past when we were novices
other experienced ones let us board their
ship for our ﬁrst trip, Now we wish to help
you as they did.” _ .
MANY EAGERLY went onto the larger
ship. They were youths who had in "the past

Democrats and work through
these groups.- , ~

This is the best legitimate way
to gain power or inﬂuence. Aside
from these two political groups,
there are many useful and worth-
while service organizations on
campus. (e. g. HEP, NAACP,
YWCA, etc.) Why form a new
group which, if Garﬁnkle’s state-
ments are typical, will be on the '
radical fringe? _ ,

given of themselves to others and felt ready
to accept help from those more knowledg-
able than them. '
Strange as it may seem, some of the no-
vices refused to get upon the large vessels.
At ﬁrst they would give weak excuses. They
would say that the other boat was ‘not that
much stronger or they would claim the older

. men knew little more about the waters than

they themselves did.

But those from the larger ship were too
wise and too experienced to accept these an-
swers. “Do not give us false reasons,” they
would shout.” It is not a matter of physical
danger of navigational knowledge with you.
It is a question of emotion of one _man’s feel-
ing forﬂanother that keeps you from coming
on our boa ,” -

AND AS THE older men pressured these I
stubborn novices, the latter, in their frus- -

tration, exclaimed, “Yes, perhaps you are
right. Perhaps it is a matter of pride with
us. But in the name of the gods leave us
alone. ‘We have chosen our course and we

A will fight by ourselves.” ‘

But the older ones knew it was more

‘ than a matter of momentary pride with

those who remained on the other boat. It
was part of their whole life pattern. Those
who stayed on the smaller boat were not
men who could let down the walls that hide
the feelings of all of us. The older men had
asked them to receive knowledge and guid-

ance and then give it to future novices who_

would struggle as they once had. Moreover
they asked the novices to work together to
try to see their common problems. .
WHILE A few who stayed on the small-
er boat by themselves were swept off the
boat or, meet a similar end, the majority
made it to the isle to hunt with the others
who had voyaged on the more secure vessel.

The elders often noted that those who ‘

had stayed by themselves had had much
more ‘taken out of them by their first voy-
age and never could enjoy the treasure as
much as the other novice. The elders (most
of whom had chosen the larger vessels in
years past) -felt the stubborn ones were so

_ worn because aboard the small craft each

individual’s battle, was his own. With no one
to guide him who had past experience and
with ‘little communication between himself
and his fellow voyagers, he had no one to
whom to go for help‘ or consolation when
crisis arose.’ ‘

“What a pity,” the elders would think,-

“that some young men, while strong. and
intelligent", do not have the sense to look
into their own souls!” ‘ ‘

 University’s Preparatory Program   I  

 

I Beneficial to High School Students

By BERNI McLEOD ‘

When so many of his friends
become auto workers, a high
school student can have very lit-
tle motivation to do college work.‘
The summer phase of the Univer-
sity’s Special College Prepara-
tory Program was designed for a
person who’s neighborhood does
not encourage plans for higher
education.

According to Dr. James A. Kehl,
administrative director of the
program, “We hoped that we
would give these kids -A little
taste of college and‘ bring them
back during the year to renew
their spirits." '

Every Pittsburgh public school
but Allderdice had students in
the six week program of English,
,math, and social studies courses
of neither strictly high school
nor college character. .Such
courses, without high school or
college credit were designed to
strengthen students in the areas
and awaken new interest, were
taught by high school teachers in
cooperation with University pro-P
fessors.

_ The 50 students, selected from
200 applicants upon the basis of

college potential and ambition,

attended these classes in Uni-
versity classrooms and lived
week-days in either McCormick
Hall or the Towers. Their tuition
and housing was free of charge.

“Such a cost-free program
would have never gotten off the
ground,” mentioned Dr. Kehl,

“without the aid of the Olfice of_

Economic Opportunity and es-
pecially the Pittsburgh founda-
tions such .as the A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust,
the Sarah Mellon Scaife Founda-
tion, and the Pitcairn-Crabbe
Foundation,” explained Dr. Kehl.

The interest: of the students
greatly helped the program and
w.as reﬂected in a story told by
Dr. Kehl. One day, during a pol-
itical science course, the instruc-
tor asked the student if he should
reduce the amount of home work.
In'response a student countered,
“If this is what is expected in
college, perhaps we better do it.”

“This was an unusually wise
attitude for an 11th grader,”
noted Dr. Kehl.

Three of the students have en-
tered the University this fall;
the others have returned to the
public schools. The groups will
return for lectures and programs

their interest. According to Dr.
Kehl, the greatest success would
not be getting all 50 into good
colleges, but even proving to
some that college is not for them.
At least they will have broader
attitudes,” he said. ‘

James Walsh, a Ph.D. candi-
date in sociology, and Kathy Her-
ald, a senior in Liberal Arts, two
of the four counselors were very
much impressed by the quality
of the group. “None of the boys
had similar backgrounds,” men-
tioned Walsh, “but in two weeks
most were _the best of friends,
even if they disagreed sometimes.
This is an attitude we hope more
University students would have.”

’ “If these kids asked us to do
something,” added Miss Herald,
“we”d kill ourselves to do it.
They did have some complaints
though, especially about being
kept so separate.”.

Dr. Kehl also commented on
possible program improvements.
Among these would be permitting
students to take straight college
courses, including standard lec-
ture and recitation sections. The
present program, though college
oriented, had too much of a high
school ﬂavor. «

TWO PLAYS in the Oklahoma game that each coach protested. Ben

‘W    

By GEORGE M. LIES

Playing goalie for a soccer
team is hard enough, but
playing for a team that al-
lows the opposition to run
past the defense is harder.
Last week against West
Chester, Ed Zelnick, con-
fronted this problem.

Play after play, or so it
seemed, West Chester, using
mainly a long kick and run
type of game, broke through
the ‘fullbacks, the soccer team’s
last line of resistance, and show-
ered the goalie Zelnick with rock‘-
et-like kicks.

Many times the Rams’ full-

  Phi Kappa Theta Loses

* , To PiKA;Pl1iGam Wins

Fraternity A Softball action reaches a climax at Schen-
ley Oval today when Phi Epsilon Pi (1-0) clashes with Sigma
Alpha Mu (2-0) to decide one of the berths in the league’s

ﬁnals.

Meanwhile, Pi Kappa Alpha,
the defending champion in the
Fraternity B circuit, edged Phi
_Kappa Theta, 4-3, at the Oval last
Monday to advance into the ﬁnals
round.

Two errors by Phi Kap pitcher,
Tom Wittman, enabled PiKA to
tie the game at 3-3 and then go
ahead with a run in the ﬁfth

' , inning. Except for three other

misplays in the game, two by
PiKA, both teams showed no
charity towards the other in the
ﬁeld. A series of singles in the
first inning gave Phi Kap the
Fraternity B circuit, edged hPi
lead, 3-0, but PiKA rallied to win.

In other B League action, Phi
Gamma Delta trounced Theta
Chi, 30-5. Bill Baloh, hitting
three home runs, and Joe He-

berle, getting two, led the FiJi’s
revitalized attack against the now
eliminated Theta Chi.

Next Wednesday, Phi Gam
(1-1) meets Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon (1-1).

in front of their goal and then
kick it far upﬁeld to the wings or
the center forward. These long
clearances would sometimes catch
the soccermen sleeping and be-
fore they awoke, an opponent
had slipped by the defensive men
and headed for the goalie all by
his lonesome.

Now for Zelnick, who before
this season had never played the
goal position, this lapse of de-
fense caused him to worry. “The
night after the game, the boys
(his fraternity brothers) told me
I was yelling in my sleep,” he
said. “I must have played the
game eight times, over and over
again in that nightmare.”

Not only did the defense have
trouble with those long passes,
they had trouble with West Ches-
ter's small, but very quick players.

“Our defense got sucked up a
little bit too far in this one be-

cause as soon as they came up,
West Chester shot their wings
and halfbacks downﬁeld,” said

Ferd Sauer.
“They had an advantage of a

lot of speed on us and it just 
seemed that their forward line

was beating our fullbacks the  
whole game,” said Zelnick. “They MARRIED

had a center forward who could
really kick the ball and he kept
putting it down in our end of the
ﬁeld.”

And, everytime the ball came
to the booters’ half of the ﬁeld,
so did the opposition. “Although
most of the play stayed at the

Harriers Prepare For

Navy, Penn‘St., WVU 9

- The cross-country squad is in an odd position. There are

   

 

 

 

three meets remaining in the season, but they are spread
over six weeks. The meets are scheduled for every other

Saturday, with the next meet against Navy on October '9.
The absence of regular intercollegiate competition will /

undoubtedly affect the squad. Both the runners and Coach

Carl Rees feel the situation will help the harriers . And, the

two Week respite which will
help the most, is the one right
now until the Navy meet. There
are a number of reasons for
thinking as they do.

First, Dave Eichenlaub, the
team's number one man, is suf-
fering from chest pains. His ail-
ment is a mystery to the doctors.
But the fact remains that he
needs time to recover. He has
started to work out with the
other runners, but cannot stand
the sustained pace of full work-
outs. It’s problematical whether
“Eich” will be ready for the Navy
meet.

Second, it’s no secret that
some of the runners are not in
top shape yet. They need the ex-
, tna time to work. Says Co-captain
Don Hinchberger, “This break
will do us a lot of good. We need
to go out on the course and really
work, and I think Coach Rees
realizes it too after our two per-
formances so far this year.”'

That Coach Rees. does indeed
recognize that the harriers need
work is illustrated by the work-
out he put the boys through on
the day following the meet. On
what would normally be a loosen-
ing up day, the team ran the
course on a timed basis, along

‘ with their regular workout.

With a 1-2 record, "the team
must sweep all three meets to
better .500 West Virginia will

probably be an easy win. No one H

/seems to know just how good the

Penn Staters are, following their

summer of training in South
America. One thing that‘ is cer-
_ tain, is that Navy will be tough.

If Eichenlaub recovers, and, if
the Juniors get into shape and
run up to their capabilities, the
“harriers will have a successful
season. If the situation does not
improve, it will be justanother
mediocre team in a long line of
mediocrity at Pitt. '

tack,” said Zelnick, “Whenever
they shot those long kicks into
our territory and then beat our
fullbacks, I had to come out from
the goal. Otherwise, they would
have scored if I didn’_t get to the
ball before they did.”

The score keeper marks down
the number of shots taken and
sometimes the number of saves
made by. a goalie, ' but Zelnick
* Said he wished the scorer marked
the number of times he had to
come out of the goal to stop an
offensive drive.

Despite the ‘apparent ﬂaws in
the defense, everything cannot
be blamed on this phase of the
game. An injury to Al‘Traun-
steiner, the regular left wing,

"threw the entire team, especially ~

the offense, into confusion. And,
as the offense goes, so goes the
defense.

“Traunsteiner led most of the
offensive drives during the early
part of. the game when we were
real close to their goal, but when
he came out, ‘everything was dis-
