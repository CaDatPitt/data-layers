5 Points Pose
Problems To
SC Efficiency,

By JULIE THOMAS

Five basic problems face
the University’s student gov-
erning bodies:

1.) Lack of unity because
of! poor communication and
co—operation among student

organizations t h e m s elves, and
among student organizations and

2.) lack of central organization
because of specialization in indi-
vidual organizations,

3.) lack of continuity in leader-
ship because of the rapid turnover
of students in the University,

4.) lack of student participation
because of a lack of speciﬁc pur-
pose and an overlap of functions
within many organizations, and

.5.) lack of identification with
the Universitybecause of its c_la”ss-
less state.

Students Meet

These problems were pinpointed
last Saturday by a small group of
student leaders and members of
the administration in an attempt
to clarify and understand the ef-
fects of the trimester system on
student activities and organiza-
tions.

“Too often the trim_ester is the
scapegoat of faulty planning,”
Jean Donehoo, president of As-
sociated Women Students said.

“The real problem is largely a
matter of adjustment on the part
of the student governing bodies
themselves.”

Devised Student Teaching Plan '

_Hunt Cultivated Field

. Of English VVriting

By TOM BRYANT
From an office high in the cathedral, Percival Hunt re-
flects upon his long teaching career with pride and looks
forward to a life of writing and leisure activity.
Hunt, retired since 1949, founded‘ the writing department

at the University in 1922.

A graduate of the University of Iowa, Hunt was brought

,to the University by former

chancellor John Bowman. During '

his active teaching career, he in-
stiuted and personally taught the
freshman composition classes,
short story writing, poetry, and
Shakespearian literature courses.
Devised Plan
He also devised a unique plan
for training future English and
composition teachers.
that the best learning method was
actual observation, he arranged
the seating of hi.s classes with
freshman. undergraduates in the
front rows and groups of student
teachers in the rear.
One of these student teachers
'was Dr. Edwin Peterson, who
today conducts the freshman
composition courses.
In addition to teaching, another
love of Percival Hunt is writing
books. One of his works, “Samuel

. Pepys,” has been widely acclaim-

ed by critics as “saying more in
a thin book of essays about ‘liter-
ature than many authors say in
thick volumes.”

In the near future, Hunt plans-

to publish a new book on 15th
century English literature- He
feels that the Rennaissancc era
has received enough literary at-
tention and that the “ordinary
people” of the earlier period
merit some comment. ’
Advances Made

In reminiscing about his past
years at the University, he feels
that the advances currently being
made by the administration are
“most exciting.” However, “I feel
that the heart of the University
is*still the classroom, the stu-
dents,'and the teachers,” he com-

mcnted. _

In trying to compare the
writing of the past with that of
the present, he feels that “the
writing that stands the test of
time is likely to be the best
writing.”

“How many novels written 100
years. ago are still famous today?
In proportion to the number writ-
ten, there are very few.”

Though no longer active in uni-
versity affairs, the reputation and
deeds of this outstanding scholar
live on in numerous newspaper
and magazine articles. By continu-
ing to write in his 33rd floor
oﬁfice, Percival Hunt maintains
contact with the school he loves
so well.

Representative
Of Drexel, Here

To Interview

A representative of the Drexel
Institute of Technology Graduate
School of Library Science will be
at the Placement Service Monday
and Tuesday to interview stu-
dents interested in graduate work
in this ﬁeld.

Financial aid is available to
qualiﬁed candidates. There is an
acute shortage of trained librar-
ians in this country and graduates
start at good salaries and have
their choice of geographic loca-
lions.

In view of the present econo-
mic conditions, Dr.‘Walter Rite-
nour, Placement Director, advises
all qualiﬁed Liberal Arts students
to give serious thought to grad-
uate study here at the University
or elsewhere. The experience of
the Placement Service clearly de-
monstrates the value of graduate
study in increasing employability
at much higher salaries than those
offered to Bachelor's Degree grad-
uates.

-Interested candidates should
sign for interviews at 219 Schen-
ley Hall.

“I’m much better at cook-

Gramer, but those who know
her believe that she can do
both with amazingly memor-
able results.

Clara, as she prefers to be
called, is employed by the Univer-
sity as a Home Economics Assist-
ant and rules the roost in the
plush dining areas and kitchens on
the Women’s floor of the Cathe-
dral.

Clara assists in the planning and
preparation of daily luncheons,
dinners and teas which are spon-
sored by the various women’s or-
ganizations and other groups on
campus. She also supervises the
Chancellor’s teas and other admin-

,Aside from spending about 99
per cent of her time with her work
at the school, Clara is an active

TEACHEK in! THE .P9~(cH i7EPAr;T/v\EN1'.”

 

A group of student leaders and administrators recently
pinpointed ﬁve obvious lacks in student government. They
seemed to realize that these lacks were not caused by par-
ticular leaders, but rather as a result of attempting to main-
tain a decaying system.

Most of these lacks can be applied to many other stu-
dent organizations—one in particular. This is the develop-
ment of leaders in a university which has a rapid turnover
of students. Although this is not a new problem at the Uni-
versity, it is an accelerated one because of the trimester.

~ iOften when leaders of various groups are trying to ﬁnd,

a solution to a problem, they just about succeed in doing
this when graduation time arrives. Their successors, who
lack insight into the problem, will then hash it over again.
The circle and ‘the problems never end.

The student leaders and administrators who have
brought this problem to light "suggested as a solution a
leader training program.

If executed properly, this could be worthwhile. The
training would prove unsatisfactory, however, if each
leader were expected to thoroughly educate his successor.
No one student has the amount of time that would be needed
to do this effectively.

The leadership training program could be divided
among’. several groups, however, so that it would not rest
completely on one individual.

It could begin during freshman orientation week, be
continued in monthly seminars held throughout the fresh-
man’s ﬁrst year, and even could be taught as a credit course
for upperclassmen.

The necessity of a program like this is extremely evi-
dent at the University. Participation in activities has dimin-
ished considerably since the trimester system has been
adopte.d—the main reason appearing to be that students are
not prepared to accept responsibility.

The failure to have this type of experience can be quite '

harmful when one lea.ves the University and enters the
working world; he will be expected to possess this tool.

The group of student leaders and administrators will
continue to meet during the next few weeks with the pur-
pﬁe of analyzing the present system of student government
and the general problem of student participation in activi-
ties. ’

We hope that this investigation will uncover many of
the areas of weak communication which exists between
various members of the University; we hope that they will
suggest solutions for the existing problems which must be
removed in order that students can be thoroughly educated.

lems and dangers in an hour of national peril,
President Kennedy said that time ‘
was running out and things may ‘ '
get worse before they get better.

In discussing the “P e a c e
Corps” which many Pitt students”
backed last November by signing
a petition, in favor of the “Peace
Corps,” Kennedy said the pro-
gram would be expanded further
so that Americans of_""a11 ages
could enlist to work in under-.
developed lands. ’

Why should engineering stu-
dents, science majors» and students in the arts want
to serve in under-developed nations? If one wanted
to be romantic, he could say that it would be excit-

. A ing and differg1t——but the glamor would surely

wear off within one week.
For Nobleness

Tobe noble iseven more inconsistent with the
American’s character. No one really would want
to leave this country in order to help another nation
progress. The‘ facilities, ‘Eonveniences and leisure

 life in America are too attractive to give up for the

sake of being noble.

But Kennedy’s statement aboutltime running out
is beginning to penetrate the minds of all Ameri-
cans. We know that in order to preserve the way

of life that we have established in thispcountry, we
must avoid a devastating war. Yet envious nations
are constantly looking over our shoulders, desiring
what we have, willing to join with adverse forces
to gain what we have. To share is a hard task for
people who have become rather indifferent to other

. natiops. Yet now we must.

We must not only give time and interest to these
people, but in addition we must give of ourselves.
Only by sincerely showing these people that we do
want them to have the leisure which we have
gained through our democratic system, can we gain
the peace that all of us desire so much. i '

Supporting Kennedy

Pitt students have joined with other universities

throughout the country to let President Kennedy.
‘know that they realize what must be do/ne,4that

they realize the seriousness of the nations position,
and that they are willing to accept the responsibil-
ity of the tasks ahead of the United States.
Possibly the realistic approach as to what
Americans must do, even if it is a selﬁsh motivation

on the part of many, will help to erase the opinion,

that most countries have concerning the American
people.

One thing that may be gained in this endeavor
is that we may really- develop in ourselves a _true
and honest desire to help these nations. To see that
they have the opportunity to enjoy the beneﬁts that
Americans take for granted.

And what may be even more surprising to many
Americans is that they might even gain something
from these countries by doing this-—not material-
istic objects’ but something worth much more.

For Better Changes

_ -By Ron Burford.

A While sitting in the Hunt Rooml eating a peanut
butter, sardine, tomato, chicken and cottage cheese
sandwich, referred to on the menu as the Hemlock
Special, I made an important decision. In the next
election, I’m going to run for the oﬂice of Chancel-
lor. For this purpose, I’ve
adopted an extremely conserva-
tive platform. I

I am opposed to expanding
our facilities. My election would
seal the doom of the dorm ex-
pansion plans. The new dorms
are'*“pointle,ss. We would have to
ﬁll them every year with fresh-
men who don’t know that there
are other places to eat in Oak-
land besides the Schenley‘ cafe-
teria, who don’t know about the
proposed restrictions that will prevent resident stu-
dents from bringing cars to school. I’d feel like a
heel when I’d look up and see all those sad, misty,
freshman eyes peering at me from their cylindrical
prisons.

I am for contraction in some areas. I’d abolish
the University police. ‘ When was the last time that
the university was robbed? What was the date of
the last murder in the Commons Room?_ What “NO
MORE CLASSES” ‘riot. was last stopped by our
police? If we need ticket hander—outers, I’m sure
that the regular Pittsburgh police department
would be glad to do the l0b free-

Fees Cut

These and other economies, such as stopping the
parking lot construction craze, would permit me to
cut the University Fee in half. This would save
each student a hundred dollars over a four year
period. Multiply that times the number of students

 

and see what you get. -
I’d abolish the student-governmentand ﬁre all
of those engaged in its busy work. England could

‘easily get along without Elizabeth and we could

get along without the student government.
I’d do away with the Convocations. Unless the

»‘person honored is a friend of yours, you forget his

name immediately and if he is your friend, you
know how smart he is already. Anyone who needs
pomp andic'eremony and quaint costumesland can-
not live without them can go see “The King and I.”
Additions Planned

I’d add_some things too. For example, I’d give
each engineer, med student and law student a year’s
supply of NoDoz. I’d give each student who drives
to school and has to ﬁnd a parking place a lucky
charm. I’d try to increase the number of pretty
girls attending Pitt. They do more to enhance the
scenery thanall the groundskeepers put together.
I’d have some of the boys ‘from the Army _ROTC
patrol the Fifth Avenue side of the campus with
their riﬂes in order to protect us against thoseidiots
who use our long block for walking their dogs.

Speaking of ROTC, I change a few things there
too. I’d get the armed forces to change their uni-
forms from those inconvenient things they’re using
now to black slacks and white sport shirts. Just
think of the dry cleaning bills that this change
would eliminate. Also think of the comfort that
would be restored to drill days. I’m sure that the
army and air force would readily go along with
the change since they are always ready to listen
to logic. ‘ l

I hope thetwhole student body will back me in
my campaign. Even if we don’t carry the election,
perhaps we can force the party in power to make
some of these changes itself.

By the way, when is the next election?

a whole.

Ron Miller, president of Men’s
Council, pointed out that past
attempts to pass a bill or present
a project considered beneﬁcial
to either the University. the stu-

dents or both, was opposed by
the administration often without
any apparent reason.

He cited a recent proposal that‘

the price of the yearbook, The
Owl, be included in the University
fee. According to Miller, the plan
received a ﬂat veto without any
further discussion.
See Both Sides
“It is obvious that situations
must be understood from both the
student’s and the administration's
point of view before any action
can be started,” commented Chuck
rlsler, president of Student Gov-

.;ernment. ‘

“And this can only be done
with cooperation and communi-
cation from both sides,” he
added.

Sue White, Senate representa-
tive, suggested the formation of a
Campus Council which would
function as a sort of United Na‘-
tions of the University.

administration would send repre-
lsentatives in order to discuss prob-

Others felt that the Council
would be merely another unwieldy
organization with little no
power and having the same duties

was the develop-
ment of a leadership training
program whereby incoming offi-
cers of any organization would
attend a workshop to learn spe-
ciﬁcally the, duties of their po-
sitions.

There was general agreement on

this idea. T

Other areas discussed were
brought up by Jim Groninger, past
president of Interfraternity Coun-
cil and a December graduate, who
felt that more and better relations
should be established between stu-
dents and alumni.

It was explained that such a
project was now being handled in
the newly formed Student and

Alumni Association.

Ex-Teammates
Battle "in Colorful

Freshman Contest
By ED HOWARD

The once-beaten, Panther
freshman basketball team
clashes this Saturday, with
the Duquesne frosh, in what
ﬁgures to be the toughest test
of the season for the Cubs.

The game is scheduled for 6
p.m. in the Field House.

The Bluffite frosh have come up
with one of their ﬁnest units this
year. Heading the Red & Blue
attack are two boys from west-
ern Pennsylvania, Willie Somer-
set and John Cegalis.

Man Underneath

Cegalis, a 6’-6” graduate of
Pittsburgh’s. North Catholic, has
been the big man underneath for
the little Dukes. Last week against
an army team that
Chuck Hursh, former Panther
basketball star, Cegalis sparked
the decisive victory with 34 points.

Somerset, only 5’-9", packs a
lot of scoring wallop on his
small frame. Willie, the Dukes
leading scorer, was a teammate
of Brian Generalovich, Panther
frosh star, on last year’s PIAA
Class A championship team
from Farrell. Another Farrell,
graduate, Dick Kudelko, has
been a sparkling court man for
the Red & Blue. .-

Comments made by Cat" Coach.
Carl Peterson indicate that the
Dukes can play defense, too.

Tight Defensive Play »

‘‘Duquesne’s tight defensive play
has been a factor in.a1l of their
games," he said. “They seem to
be well based in all the funda-
mentals, and we don’t expect to
be able to fast break them as
much as usual. We’re well pre-
pared, but this will defintely be
our toughest game.”

The Panther matmen will
oppose a strong Michigan
State team at the Field House
on Saturday. The grapplers

The match is scheduled to start

The Spartans will be out to

Michigan State is strong in the

lately,” he added. “Our defensive
game is improved. It was even
good against Miami (Ohio), but
we just couldn’t hit on our shots.”
As examples of the containing of
offensive stars, Timmons cited two
prime cases in the Redskin game.
Good on Defense‘

“We held Lawson to 7 points,”
he said, “and he had been averag-
ing 19 points. Also we limited
Zeller to 15 points, and he was
hitting 21 a game.”

Zeller scored 111 points in the
first half with Dick Falenski
guarding him, but in the second
canto, Timmons switched Tom
Maloney to the diﬁicult assign-
ment. Maloney harassed him so
much, that he lost his temper,
forced his shots, and was lifted
from the game by his coach.

While satisﬁed with the overall
performances of his team this
year, Timmons speaks with hope-
ful ambitions when he dwells on

Frats, Sororities
Stage Hoop Battle
In Greek Week

lt’s “god versus goddess” on
Tuesday, Feb. 14, when an all-star
sorority team does battle with an
all-star, fraternity squad, in a
 ‘basketball’ ’game to highlight the
Greek week sports program.
The just-for-fun hoop fray is
set for eight o’clock that evening
on the Field House floor.
The girls, as usual the calmer

victory, and they plan to use
‘show-off” tactics to wrap up a
decision,

Their fraternity counterparts,
on the other hand, have set up a
rigid schedule of practice, practice
and more practice, in preparation
for the big contest.

Members Needed
' '1 *1 o *1
E or 1* encing Club

The Fencing club is still seek-
ing members to fill their deplet-
ed ranks. ,

A competitive team may result
if enough men tryout for the
squad. Right now, however, the
club is unable to ﬁeld a full team.
In order for students to join the
club they must have had. some
previous experience.

Any students wishing to try out
for the team should contact Leo
femis at the Field House, Ext.
‘71.

“We’re just an average club," 
, Timmons remarked, previous to

the freshmen roundballers, who
will graduate into his ranks next

year. V
“We’re going to lose our whole
front line,” he sighed. “Brian

Generalovich, Dave Sauer and Cal
Sheffield will have to step right in.
Paul Krieger should be a big help
as well. We’re hoping that he
puts some more ‘weight on. We
need strength under the boards.”
Keeps Fingers Crossed

Last year, however, the Cat
yearlings had a top-notch outﬁt
too, but two of the most highly
touted members were plagued with
sickness and ineligibility and this
year’s varsity suffered heavily. So
Timmons is keeping his ﬁngers
crossed.

In discussing individual senior

AV 0' sive ball, but he has been missing

“Average” Aqu

is puzzled by some of their per-
formances. Don Steinhart, who
gave early indication that he
was going to be a vital peg in
the Cat force, has been an “ini
and-outer” all season.

“We get him open,” Timmons
said, “but I wish I knew why he
can’t‘make those close shots. If
you can’t make them, you can't
make anything.”

The Panther mentor feels that
dental studies have hampered the
play of seniors John Fridley and
Dick Falenski this year. “They
have to study long hours, and
sometimes they can’t make prac-
tice,” he commented. “John has
been playing exceptional defen-

up close too. Dick has been miss-
ing layups and forcing shots.”

According to the easy going
coach, Ben Jinks still rates as the
best shooter, but he feels that he
must polish his game. 1 He also
claimed that the chief reason for
the poor showing of Bob Sankey
this season is because Sankey at-
tended school in the summer, and
didn’t get a chance to practice.

But, in general, Timmons feels
the club will break even, but is
hoping for a winning season. He
added, “But remember, we just
have an average ball club.”

WHEELERS TO PLAY

The Pittsburgh Wheelers, a
wheelchair basketball team, will
play a. team composed of mem-
bers of the Panther soccer team
this Saturday at 1 p.m. in the

With the lower weights fairly
even, the match could be decided
in the heavier division where
neither team is exceptionally
strong. Augie Arrig-one will have
a chance to wrestle closer to his
normal weight, 157 pounds.
Arrigone has been wrestling in
higher weight classes and should
be more successful at this lower
weight.

Peeryi Undecided
Jim Harrison will represent the
Cats in the 167 pound class. Har-
rison is another grappler who has
been wrestling» out of his class,
but Jim is having a good year
despite this handicap. .
Coach Peery is still undecided

as to who to put in the 177 ,

pound class. Either Bill Robb

or Chuck Shaffer will handle the
duties in this division.

Because" Michigan State does
not wrestle at 191 pounds, that.
class will be dropped for "this
match. Bob Guzik will handle the
heavyweight chores.

The Panthers, who were ex-

year, have had. only moderate

to try to bring their record back up to the .500 mark after
suffering a 56-39 defeat at the hands of Ohio University,
Monday.
Bart Haas and Tony Tresser were the only Panthers to

cord in doing so. Against Buck-

top Panther swimmer, Jim Eme1‘t.0
Sets Record H

Haas proved that the meet Sat-
urday did not take anything out
of his performance at Ohio. ilaas’
23.2 time bettered the old mark
by .1 of a second. Haas has been
improving all season and has been
an unexpected but welcome sur-
prise to Coach Grady.

Tony Tresser scored the only
other solo victory forlthe Pan-
thers in the 440 free-style event.
Tresser covered the distance in

. 5:05.2 to take the first place hon-
ors in this portion of the meet.

The only other Panther team
to share in the first place spot-
light was the 400 yard medley
relay team. '

Took First Place

The squad composed of Jerry
Sollinger, Carl Warncs, Tony
Sarsﬂcld and Dick Rush turned
in a 4:083 time to capture the
first place points.

The medley relay team's time
of 4:08.3 is a far cry from their
record setting time of 3:59.9 that
won at the Bucknell meet Sat-
urday. .

“Two meets and the traveling
time the fellows put in seemed
to take something out of them,"
commented Coach Grady.

“GIVE A MAN A TOUGH JOB AND A ‘CHANCE TO GO sow-:wH:-zmz
...AND HE’LL BREAK HIS NECK to 00 IT’’

In 1958 when Bill Ebben was only a few months
away from his engineering degree at the University .
of Detroit, he was in touch with 15 prospective

employers.

He chose the Michigan Bell Telephone Com-
pany because: “This company offered the kind of
engineering management opportunity I wanted-—
and they weren’t kidding.”

One of Bill's ﬁrst assignments was a survey of
Michigan Bell’s big Central District to ﬁnd out
how long available building space could accom-
modate the switching equipment required by rapid
telephone growth. “I wasn’t given any instruc-

- tion,” Bill says, “I was just told to do the job.”

So Bill did it. Hi_s report became the guide for
planning and budgeting future construction.

On his next move, Bill proved he could handle
supervisory responsibility. He was sent to head up

 

 

FREDERICK R. KAPPEL, President

American Telephone & Telegraph _Co.

a group of seven engineers to design a new long
distance switching center for Saginaw, Michigan
—a $4,000,000 engineering project.

Today, Bill is on the staff of Michigan Bell’s
Program Engineer. He’s working on a system for
mechanized control of telephone construction costs.

How does Bill feel about his job? “Give a man
a tough job and a chance to go somewhere —-and
he'll break his neck to do it. Of course, I don’t
think I’m going to be running the business next '
year—but I’m getting every opportunity to hit the
top. You don’t worry about opportunity here——you
worry about whether you’re as big as the jo ."

If you’re a man like Bill Ebben, a man who can

' size up a job, figure out what needs to be done, and .

then do it-then you should get in touch with one of
the Bell Companies. Visit your Placement Oﬂice for
literature and additional information.

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most, vital, intelli-
gent, positive and ivrnagirnatizve men we
can possibly ﬁnd.”
