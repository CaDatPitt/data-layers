Health. care proposals prompting questions

By Jackie Duggan
For The Pitt News

i , With Pitt considering proposals from

HealthAmerica and Blue Cross for sole
provider health insurance status, the faculty
and staff are wondering if their best interests
are really an issue. _

“We are worried about only having one
organization insurer and what that might do
to health care rates in the future,” said Mark
Ginsburg, president of the United Faculty.

The United Faculty and the Staff
Association Council are circulating a petition
opposing any change that could’ eliminate
competition by making one company the
sole provider of health care for Pitt employ-
ees.

Faculty and staff have long been able to
choose among health insurance plans offered
by competing vendors — Blue Cross and
HealthAmerica. In November, Blue Cross
came to the Medical Rates and Program
Review Committee with a proposal that said
it would save the university an estimated 5
million dollars in the first year in exchange
for the elimination of HealthAmerica  an

t option for employees. HealthAmerica

responded with a series of counter proposals,
one of which would make it theisole
provider.

The two main concerns, as stated in the
petition, are that sole provider status will
force employees and their families to break
long—standing relationships with their doctors
and that awarding monopoly status to either

Sleep and eat well to avoid f/U

By Julie D. Hannon
For The Pitt News

It’s that time of year again. No class-
room remains undisturbed by sneezes and
sniffles, the bark ‘of a cough or the frustra-
tion of fatigue.

It’s ﬂu season, according to Dave Zazac
of the Allegheny County Health
Department, and several‘ hundred people
within the county have become victims of
inﬂuenza, which generally causes a rapid
onset of fever, chills, headache, cough,
sore throat and exhaustion.

Typically, the flu season lasts from

October to March, said Zazac, when the
virus has the opportunity to make a larger
impact. This is because the weather forces
many people indoors, where the flu is
passed to friends and family members.
The virus generally runs a three- to 10-
day course.

The Allegheny County Health
Department conducts a weekly flu watch
to monitor the virus by maintaining a sur-
veillance network of 13 medical centers
scattered across the county, while also
surveying schools for flu and absen-
teeism.

(Flu, page 3‘

company would risk larger rate increases in
the future.

According to Ginsburg, another concern is
the suspicion that the Blue Cross proposal is
being favored because the university’s med-
ical center has an unfavorable relationship
with HealthAmerica. An article in the Feb. 2
Utziversity Times said UPMC and
HealthAmerica were recently involved in lit-
igation over patient referrals, and while they
did settle out of court, the two organizations
do not have a working relationship.

The suspicion arose when administrators
on the Medical Rates and Program Review
Committee presented the Blue Cross propos-
al on Nov. 1, 1994, to faculty and staff on the
committee.

CWO sends 0

message to

Governor Ridge

By Allison Stallone

Staff Writer.

Newly inaugurated Gov. Tom Ridge will
receive 350 reminders about his campaign

» promises dealing with women’s issues from

the ’Campus’ Worf1en’s Organization.

CW O, in conjunction with the “Family Law
Project,” setup tables in the William‘Pitt
Union on Jan. 17 and 26 to get people to sign
postcards that will be sent to Ridge’s office in
Harrisburg in a couple of weeks.

Ridge’s campaign promises that most con-
cern CWO include funding for family plan-
ning, revision of the state’s rape laws, Megan’s
Law -— which gives communities notice

before a convicted sexual offender moves into

their community — and Ridge’s views on
abortion.

One of Ridge’s most controversial campaign
commercials featured a woman who had been
raped by a juvenile who was set free because

of his age. She claimed that if Ridge had been‘

in office her juvenile offender would have
been doing adult time. CWO said it hopes
Ridge will stick with that promise and revise
the juvenile rape laws too. '

Stephanie Sudzina, co-president of CWO,
said she hopes to get a good response from
Ridge, but won’t give up if she doesn’t. ‘-

“This is our first attempt now that he is in
office, but it certainly won’t be the last,” she

1 said. “We plan to do more campaigning, more

notices and more petitions.” A,

CWO is not working alone on this project.
The “Family Law Project” is a pro—choice
group based in Philadelphia that is helping not
only Pitt, but also Temple University and Penn
State to participate in the campaign.

CWO already has 350 postcards signed.
Sudzina said she is sure the other schools are
getting a good response too.

“They had more postcards than we did, and
I’m sure they met their quota,” said Sudzina.

The postcards from all the schools will be
sent to Planned Parenthood in Harrisburg to be
personally delivered as reminders to Ridge’s
office.

Sudzina said she hopes this administration
will do a better job with female issues.

“We want to thank him for promising to
help fund family planning,-and hopefully he

MOSCOW — Chechnya’s
freedom fighters ‘shot down
a Russian fighter-bomber
and are vowing to continue
assaults on the Russian
army.

On Saturday, rebels used
anti-ai-rcraft fire to shoot
down a Su-25 war plane.
The plane was shot down
near Grozny in a town called
Geshy.

The loss to the Russian
army is considered insignifi-
cant, but to the rebels the
bombing is being considered
a victory against the Russian
army and has helped to build
morale among the rebel
group.

Some, however, are con-
cerned about reprisals from
the Russian forces. Russia
has limited the exit routes to
Grozny on the south and
west side of the city in
recent days. ‘

Despite the hardships,
rebel fighters vow to keep
up the resistance despite
being outgunned and out-
numbered. — Reuters

CHINA — Foreign Minister
of Trade Wu Yi announced
Sunday that in retaliation for
the Clinton administration's
decision to attach a 100 per-
cent duty on $1.08 billion in
imports from China, that

F

nation has been forced to
attach a 100 percent duty on
American imports to China.

The Clinton administration
attached the duty because it
could not reach an amicable
agreement with China over
intellectual property protec-
tion of compact discs, films,
books and movies.

Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill.,
head of the Ways and Means
trade subcommittee, sup-
ports the Clinton administra-
tio‘n’s move, as do the

"United States’ European

trading partners.

The United States is
demanding stricter enforce-
ment of China’s laws pro-
tecting imported intellectual
property from theft and pira-

cy.

“They wanted us to immedi-
ately accept it,” said James
Holland, president of the Faculty
Assembly. “That something had
been going on for a long time
between Blue Cross and UPMC
is a very reasonable assump-
tion.” _

Since the beginning of
January, the medical rates com-
mittee has been conducting pro-
posal meetings with representa-
tives from both Blue Cross and
HealthAmerica.

Darlene Lewis, the vice chan-
cellor for human resources, said
the review committee asked the
two insurers to resubmit similar
packages so administrators, fac-
ulty and staff on the committee
could compare the proposals.

“Both have had equal time. I
think we are giving them both
fair consideration,” said Lewis.
“It’s not as if we are not giving
HealthAmerica a fair shake.”

As for the influence of
UPMC, Lewis said, “Yes, the
well-being of the medical center
is a part of the criteria we are
looking at. We are a part of the
medical center, and we can’t
ignore their concerns.”

Lewis said the main consider-
ations in the proposal meetings
are the sick cost savings,,the
medical center and the continu-
ity of care.

Holland said the pros and cons
of sole provider status are being
discussed at the meetings, and
Pitt staff and faculty are well
represented this time.

“We are hearing it all,” he
said. “I don’t know that we will
be able to come to any kind of
unanimous agreement, but there
is very strong sympathy for
maintaining choice, and that
would require more than one
insurance company.”

The final decision will be
made by the chancellor and the
board of trustees by the end of

' March.

will be more woman-friendly '

than Casey’s administration was,”
she said. ’

Casey’s administration caused
controversy with women’s
groups when he implemented the
Abortion Control Act, which
requires women to wait 24 hours
before having an abortion, getting
parental consent for women
under 18 and spousal notiﬁcation.

But according to Sudzina,
Ridge’s administration is already
looking a lot better than Casey’s.

» “We couldn’t be more pleased
with his campaign promises, but
we want him to remember that he
was a pro-choice candidate,” she
said.

Along with the postcard tables,
CWO also set up a sex-informa-
tion table where. it gave out 400
condoms that it received from the
Student Health Department, as
well as booklets on AIDS, STDS,
family planning and how to use a
condom correctly.

There will be another sex-infor-
mation table and postcard-signing

In order for the flu virus to be confirmed,
an individual must seek medical attention
where a throat culture is taken. The flu

count for Allegheny County now stands at ,

11 confirmed cases, but it is estimated that
for every confirmed case as many as sever-
al hundred to a thousand may go uncount-
ed.

Zazac said if symptoms develop, first
treat the illness as a common cold. But if
the symptoms persist, seek medical atten-
tion, get plenty of rest and drink lots of ﬂu-
ids to prevent dehydration.

“If it’s the flu, you’ll know it,” said
Zazac. “Fatigue is a big factor. It’ll knock
you off your feet for a couple of days.”

He said the best way to prevent the flu is
to eat nutritiously and get plenty of sleep.

“Prevention basically means doing what

Despite the outbreak, it’s not too late to
vaccinate, according to the Health
Department. Although the Student Health

Service is not currently offering flu shots, ~

they are available at the Visiting Nurses
Foundation for $10. But note that it takes
two weeks after receiving the shot to build
up the necessary antibodies to fight the
virus.

Zazac does not advise students to rush to
get vaccinated unless they are at high risk,
such as if they have asthma or a chronic
disorder. “If they take good care of
themselves and be sure to get enough sleep
so that their immune systems can do their
stuff, they shouldn’t need the shot.”

President Clinton has selected a replacement for former
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders. Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. is
the president’s first choice for the post, and despite the out-
cries from some radically conservative Republicans, he
should be confirmed by the Senate.

Dr. Foster is an obstetrician and acting director of the
Meharry Medical College in Nashville. He has worked with
Planned Parenthood and specialized in preventing teenage
pregnancy and infant mortality. .

Because he has specialized in working on problems which
politicians on both sides of the aisle have agreed must be
faced, he must not be lost in an ideological struggle which
shows few signs of ending. Being an obstetrician, Dr. Foster
has performed abortions through the course of his career. In
a statement on Friday, he said that he had performed less
than 12 abortions and these were to save lives, or for those
impregnated in cases of rape and incest (Reuters). ‘

Anti-abortion activists have launched a campaign to con-
tact senators in order to urge them to oppose Dr. Foster’s
confirmation. Pro-choice activists have also begun a cam-
paign to support the president’s nominee.

Unfortunately, the real issues will be lost in the rhetoric
of two sides of a debate which consumes far too much air
time politically. Once again, the issue of abortion will
impede real progress in solving problems. Dr. Foster’s
record will be ignored if the Senate gets caught up in the
abortion fight.

For instance, Dr. Foster has developed a program in
Tennessee in which he teaches teenagers in two Nashville
housing projects to delay sex and having children in order
to keep their lives on track. According to The New York
Times, the program, which is call “I Have a Future,” com-
bines tutoring, job training, medical life services and family
life classes.

Finally there is someone in Washington who recognizes
the complexities of these sorts of problems and has put
together a solution which combines the many elements
required to solve them. The United States no longer can
afford to have mere pontificating rhetoric in response to its-
pressing needs. ;

The appointment of Dr. Foster would be positive action
towards realizing some of the programs set out for solving
one of the major problems outlined in the State of the
Union address: teenage pregnancy. This would help solve a
number of other problems, including the breakdown of fam-
ilies and urban violence.

The best way to help end this madness is to write your
senators. Tell them not be caught up in the ideology of a
debate that won't end, but rather to look at this man’s

' record and proposals to see if he will really benefit the

country. Far too often Washington is looking out for the
good of special interests rather than the good of the
American people. 4

Violence increasing on campus

ast Thursday night, as I
was returning home from

studying, an individual

‘standing in front of the

Cathedral of Learning asked me
for directions. As I wanted to
help someone in apparent need,
I approached him slightly, still
keeping a distance of about 15
feet in between us. As I was
approaching, I saw two individ-
uals emerge from hiding behind
a car, and the individual I had
first seen leaped forward, called
me an obscene name and
punched me in the side of the
face. '

I immediately turned and ran.
My attacker chased me from the
Cathedral to well past the
William Pitt Union before giv-
ing up. The entire time I was
being chased, none of the

-bystanders I saw- made any

effort to help me. (I was shout-
ing “call the police.”) I was not
surprised. I was, however, quite
surprised that I did not see a sin-
gle police officer anywhere at all
in between the Cathedral and the
Towers. After my attacker gave
up, I backtracked to the union

Diversity

As a Cultural Diversity Facilitator, I can tell
you that our goal is not to “indoctrinate” stu-
dents, but to introduce them to new concepts and
opinions that are prevalent on an urban college
campus. I think this is a major part of the educa-
-tion process andis just as important as “book-
smarts.” I don’t think we need to “throw” diver- .
sity_ in your face '—-., it is .a  of everyday life,
 fJespeci_ally..-as-yoti sit in class. _ I . V‘  '
- It's hard to believe that a university would
offer classes “aimed solely at-promoting hatred,” '
and I think this type of statement inhibits the
learning process by creating a hostile environ-

and banged on the doors to get
the security guard’s attention.
The guard was either" not there
or ignored my cries.

I am not writing this to acquire
sympathy. I am physically
unhurt. I am writing this to ques-
tion the appropriateness of the
university’s response to the
apparent increasing F violence in
the Oakland area. We are told by
Leon Haley that the campus is
still safe and that we should not
change our habits. We are told
by the university that security
has been increased in the wake
of the assault on David Orsbom.
If this is indeed true, and not
merely a public relations move,
then why did I not see one single
police officer while I was being
chased? . ,

If an officer had been on patrol
anywhere in between the cathe-
dral and Hillman Library, then
most likely the attack on me
would not have even occurred. If

there had been an officer"

patrolling the Towers the night
David Orsbom was attacked, he
would not now be in Bryn Mawr
Rehabilitation Center. If the uni-

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

versity truly cares about its stu-
dents’ safety, it will increase the
number of officers on patrol so
that these areas can be
covered.If there are budget prob-
lems, then cuts should be made
from other departments without
argument. Our safety should be
the number one priority of the
university administration.

In addition, a student who is in
a circumstance where either per-
sonal property or safety even
appears to be threatened should
file a report with the police as
soon as possible. No crime is too
small. By understanding the true
extent of criminal activity in
Oakland, the university will be

able to deal with it more effec-

tively. . -

I have no doubt in my mind
that I would be in a hospital bed
right now if I had not been able
to escape my attackers. I had no
one to depend on except myself.
If the university had been doing
its. job, this would not have been
the case.

“‘diversity’  is a direct contradiction of the

merit. This type of generalization did notwork in

the past and certainly won’t help us now.
I also disagree with your statement that

idea of equality.” MY idea of equality means that
we should all be treated the same but still be able
to cherish our differences in heritage and beliefs.
As a white, Catholic female, I look forward to
the day when I live in a world where people
accept me for my similarities, but especially for
my differences.-, I look at cultural groups as a

lot,
Saturdayfs
79-76 loss
to the No. 19 Villanova
Wildcats was by far the
absolute worst.

The Panthers (5-14 and 1-
10 in Big East play) have
now lost seven games by
five points or less.

You can say that losing to
Villanova (15-5, 8-2) by
three is a moral victory. You
can say that Pitt, which has
been rated by USA Today as
having the toughest schedule
in Division I basketball, has
played tough in every gam
besides UMass. -

But the bottom line is they
should have won a handful
of those games. And the
Villanova game was the
biggest shame of them all.

The Panthers had a six-
point lead with 50 seconds
left in regulation. After
Villanova’s Alvin Williams
nailed a three-pointer with
41 seconds, all Pitt had to do
was get the ball inbounds.
But it didn’t, andthe
Wildcatstied the game,
sending it into overtime. ,

Pitt also had a 10-point
lead with five minutes
remaining, and a three-point
advantage in overtime.

That game was all but won
for the Panthers. They lost
focus and found ways to
give ‘Nova the ball back so
it could slice Pitt’s lead
more. 3,

“It’s unbelievable what
happened out there,”
Villanova coach Steve
Lappas said. “I thought the
game was lost about five
times. I think at the end we
were like, ‘OK we’re going
to lose this, so let’s just let it
out and see what happens.”’

No disrespect, Coach
Lappas, but I don’t think
that was going through your
head. I think you’ve
watched tapes of Pitt, and
you knew that the Panthers
are notorious for playing
many could’ves and
should’ves, but never
pulling them out.

The Connecticut game,
when Pitt was up at one
point by 25, makes a strong
campaign for the worst loss.
But I think everyone at the

overtime, that Willard had
this to say: “Thank God the
rivers are frozen over.”

Pretty morbid. Probably
not even a joke. Then again,
neither is the season from
hell.

Saturday night’s pill was
particularly difficult to swal-
low. The Panthers came back
from an eight—point halftime
deficit to lead by 10, only to
see guard Jason Maile’s
three-pointer rattling out at
the buzzer in OT with Pitt
down by three.

In retrospect, that shot in
itself typified Pitt’s entire
1994-95 season — close, so
disgustingly close. ,

St. John's storms post

By Michael Kovak .

The Pitt w0men’s basket-
ball team lost its third straight
game Sa-turday, this time in
New York City at the hands
of St. John’s, 82-57.

The loss dropped the Lady

one win in
their last five games_.

St. John’s dominated all
facets of the game. It
outscored Pitt 50-28 in the
lane and 27-9 on fast break
points. St. John’s outshot the
Lady Panthers 49 percent to
35 percent for the game. Pitt
converted only 3-8 foul shots
(38 percent) to 15-20 (75 per-
cent) for St. John’s;

St. John’s opened up a 42-
19 halftime lead, on the
strength of a 29-9 run during
the final l2_ minutes of the
half, and coasted from there.

“Pitt played hard  they
played smart,” Villanova
head coach Steve Lappas
said. “It was unbelievable
what happened out there. Pitt
plays everybody tough, that’s
no secret  The difference
was that we had this guy

[Kerry Kittles], and they‘

didn’t.”

world guard who was neu-
tralized by Pitt’s unorthodox
defensive strategy for much
of the first 40 minutes, came

Junior guard Stephanie
Petho said, “The big part of
the problem was the fast
break. We were not getting
back on defense.”

Head coach Kirk Bruce said
St. John’s_ came out and sur-
prised the Lady Panthers.

“We didn’t expect St.
John’s to rebound and fast
break the way they did. We
didn’t get back on defense.
We were never in the game.”

St. John’s guard Tawana
Jackson led all scorers with
27 points in 29 minutes.
Petho led Pitt, as shewas the
only Panther in double fig-
ures with 12 points. Senior
co-captain Jenine Joyce man-
aged just two points on 1-for-

rebounds.

The Lady Panthers had won
their previous encounter
against St. John’s by a 83-65
margin on Jan. 4.

alive in the extra period,
showing why he is the Big
East’s most explosive talent.
Kittles scored 10 of
Villanova’s 16 overtime
points, giving him 26 for the
game. His two three-pointers
in the extra period were what
broke the Panthers’ backs,
and the Wildcats’ perfect
(six for six) free throw
shooting down the stretch
kept Pitt at an arm’s length.
In a tortuous season that
has now seen the Panthers
drop nine games by an aver-
age of 3.1 points, it must be

A a sobering thought for the

Panthers to know that noth-

lead in the game’s final
minute —— is a sure bet.

With just 50 ticks remain-
ing in regulation, two Andre
Alridge free throws gave the
Panthers a 62-56 edge as the
game faded into its waning
moments.»

All too often this year, late
leads and close games have
become Pitt’s kiss of death.

The Wildcats immediately
bolted down the floor after
the inbounds. While -the
Panthers were doubling up
on Kittles, they left guard
Alvin Williams alone on the
perimeter, and Williams

On the ensuing inbounds,
Jason Maile ran across the
baseline, trying to get free in
order to accept the inbound??-
pass from Orlando Antigua.
Suddenly, Maile stopped in
his tracks, and Antigua,
thinking Maile would contin-
ue running, tossed the ball
ahead of him. The pass
brushed off Maile’s finger-
tips and out of bounds.

It took the ‘Cats just three
more seconds to close the
gap to one point at 62-61, as
the Panthers suffocated
Kittles after the inbounds,
leaving forward Chuck .
Kornegay alone in the paint,
to accept the Kittles pass and
stuff it.

Villanova’s Kittles comes through in clutch

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Villanova’s Kerry Kittles
stood on the free throw line
with 22 seconds remaining
and his team down by two.
Not a droplet of sweat
showed on his poker face.

Cool as cool could be,
Kittles grabbed the ball and
singed the net both times,
silencing 6,755 raucous
Fitzgerald Field House fans
as he tied the game, 63-63.
Pitt couldn’t answer and the
game went into overtime.

“If Kittles makes the shot,
then he makes the shot, but
you don’t put Kerry Kittles
on the free throw line,”
explained Pitt coach Ralph
Willard of Mahdi Sprui1l’s
bump foul in the waning
moments of the game.

From then on it was all
Kittles, ‘as the No. 19
Villanova Wildcats nipped
the Panthers 79-76 Saturday
night, winning their seventh

“"‘lﬁ« a row.

“The difference was we
had this guy, and they
didn’t,” said Wildcat coach
Steve Lappas, pointing at his
star shooting guard. “If we

don’t have him, welose the
game. This guy really
stepped up.”

Kittles, a 6-foot-5 junior
All-America candidate, sim-
ply took over the game in
the extra frame. He scored
10 of Villanova’s 16 over-
time points, en route, to his
game-high 26 points. Two of
his four three-pointers came
inovertime, the second com-
ing from deep in the corner
as he almost fell
into his team-
mates’ laps on
the bench.

“With like 10
minutes left I told
him, ‘Hey, you’re
supposed to take
over the game.”’
Lappas said.
“And he did. He doesn’t
always listen to me, but
tonight he did. If that’s all I
have to say to him, then
well 

Averaging 20.4 a game,
Kittles was also something
special in the closing min-
utes of regulation. He scored
seven points and dished out
three assists in the final
three minutes.

And after he sank the two

free throws to tie the game,
Kittles got a piece of Pitt’s
point man Andre Alridge’s
shot with one second left.

But Kittles wasn’t always
the dominator in this game.
In fact, he was ﬂat out shut
down. He wasn’t looking for
his shots, and he couldn’t
get any good looks at the
basket. In the first half,
Kittles scored five points, as
he connected on 2 of 6
shots.

“Basically, I
didn’t do any-
thing all game
offensively,”
Kittles said. “I
was playing real
laxed most of the
game, then Ijust
figured to be
more offensive and look for
my shots more and hopefully
bring this game home for us,
and I did.”

f‘We made a point to take
out their three-point shooters
in the beginning of the
game,” Jason Maile said.
“When Kittles started hitting
threes, it was the turning
point in the game because
we took care of him the
whole game.”

Along with Pitt’s first-half
harassing defense, Kittles
was also being ridiculed by
the Field House Fanatics, as

they chanted “Kittles sucks”
throughout the game.

But the man with his
trademark right sock pulled
just below his knee and left
sock at his ankle got the last
laugh.

With 7:50 left in the sec-
ond half, Kittles connected
on a soft jumper that opened
the flood gates for the rest of
the game. On Pitt’s next pos-
session, Kittles swatted a
Panther’s shot and then hit a
streaking Eric Eberz for an
easy layup.

Later Kittles sliced Pitt’s
lead to three, 56-53, on a
knifing finger—ro1l down the
lane. Just two minutes later
he nailed a three—pointer and
then found an open Alvin
Williams for another three.

In overtime, the Fanatics
were done chanting, but
Kittles wasn’t done by a
long shot. His eight straight
points, not to mention back-
to-back three-pointers, put
the Panthers away for good.

Kittles also chipped in six
assists and five rebounds for
the game, while playing the
whole 45 minutes.

“Kittles is a great player,”
Willard said. “I admire that
kid. He plays both ends of
the floor. He’s a great play-
er, and great players win you
close games.”

Column—

°From page 5
Field House that night had a
sinking feeling going into
halftime that Pitt was going
to lose that game.

Maybe I’m just na'1've, but
the Field House didn’t have
that choking aura Saturday.
Villanova was flat — dead
flat. Pitt was playing well (in
the second half that is), and
a win was more than just a
fingertip away. It was in
Pitt’s hands.

But the Panthers just
didn’t know how to handle
It.

“We let it slip away,” Pitt
Coach Ralph Willard said.
“The old saying is: winning
is a habit, losing is a habit.
We give great efforts, and
keep giving great efforts,

and lose and lose and lose. It A

becomes a habit.”
That’s a very unhealthy
habit to have.’

Bruce said. “Melissa came in
during practice and said
she’ll be out the rest of the
year. It really affected myself
and the players.”

“Remaining focused is the
key. We know the season is
getting towards the end, and
we have to take it one game
at a time,” Petho said.

With three straight losses,
the chances of an NCAA
Tournament bid are passing
by the Lady Panthers. Last
season, Pitt finished third at
the NIT but felt it should
have received an NCAA bid.

“Going into the season, it
was in the back of everyone’s
mind after what happened
last year,” Petho said. “It is
our goal to make the tourna-
ment, and we’re all still opti-
mistic about our chances.”

Bruce said the necessary
turnaround starts with the
coaching staff.

“We need to regroup. It’s

_ up to the coaches. We’ve
been doing a lot of travelling
lately. We need to just play
the basketball that this team
knows how to play,” Bruce
said.

The Lady Panthers will
only have to travel to
Fitzgerald Field House on
Wednesday to face Big East
rival Georgetown. Pitt won
the first meeting 70-63.

“We didn’t play well
against Georgetown last
time,” Petho said. “If our
pressure defense works like
last time, we’ll be OK.”

“It is going to be a tough
game. Georgetown is physi-

cal and very quick,” Bruce"

said. “We need to start
» putting the ball in the basket
again.”

After the Georgetown
match—up, the Lady Panthers
continue their Big East
schedule when they travel to
Boston College on Saturday.
Then the No. 1 team in the
nation, the Connecticut
Huskies, come to the Field
House on Feb. 16.

fouled Kittles as the ‘Cats
were trying to tie the score.
Kittles sank both free throws
to send it into overtime.

The loss nullified an extra-
ordinary night in the paint
for the Panthers, who outre-
bounded ‘Nova 23-8 on the
offensive’ boards, including
16-3 in the second half
alone. By virtue of their
excellent rebounding, the
Panthers controlled posses-
sion throughout the second
half, allowing themselves to
creep back into the game
and eventually take the lead.

On the scoresheet, the
Panthers once again spread
the wealth, with four players
reaching double figures, led
by center Jaime Peterson,
who scored 18 points on 8-
of-14 shooting.

The Panthers could use
some time to recoup after a
loss such as this, but such
are the sacrifices inherent
with the nation’s toughest
schedule.

“We know we can play
with everybody  but I’m
getting tired of saying that,”
Alridge said. “There were a
lot of people crying [in the
locker room], a lot of people
mad.”
