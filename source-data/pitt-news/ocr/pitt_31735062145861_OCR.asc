or FRATERNITIES

Pi Lambda Phi Leads With
Percentage of 79.13% --
Sigma Alpha \Mu Second
With 76.01%--Theta Delta.
Psi Third» With 74.70%

Pi Lambda Phi,.;with an average of
79.13 per cent, more than three per
cent above the average of the runner
up, again leads the fraternities in
scholarship, it was announced at the
meeting the Inter-fraternity Confer-
ence held last night in the Phi Gamma
Delta house. Sigma Alpha Mu was
second with an average of 76.01 per
cent, and Theta Delta Psi third with
a percentage of 74.70 percent.

The comparativetable of the schol-
astic ratings of members of the con-
ference, prepared by the scholarship
committee of the Inter-fraternity Con-

‘ ference, headed by Chairman “Lefty”

Hill, shows a general increase in the
averages of the fraternities in the

1922-23 year over that of 1921-22. The
average of the leader last year was
75.99 per cent and this year the same
fraternity leads with an average of
79.13 per cent showing a gain of more
than three per cent. A similar in-
crease is evident in the averages of
the majority of the fraternities.

Pi Lambda Phi with its leading aver-
age again this year now has a ﬁrmer

ship Cup donated last year by Dean‘ and instructor at the George Westing-

J. A, Fetterman to promote interest in
scholastic efforts- To gain permanent
possession of the Fetterman trophy a
fraternity must win it three times.
The ﬁght for the lead this year is ex-
pected to ‘be close since another vic-
tory for the Pi Lams will insure their
permanent possession of the trophy.
Jack Sack, former Panther guard,

grip on the Inter—fraternity Scholar-

now football coach at Geneva College,

nies of the fraternity as president
during the successful year.

«Sigma Alpha Mu, which is second in
the rating, showed a remarkable ad-
vance over the 1921-22 rating when it
was in seventh place. Theta Delta
Psi remains in third place, the posi-
tion which they held in last year’s
rating,
