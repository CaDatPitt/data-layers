on the part of the judges,-when one
of them considering the efforts of the

caused the debate to be called a tie.
‘This is the first time such a verdict

JANE Annlms Tl] TALK
 AT STUDENT vrsrus

Jane Addams of national fame as
the founder and hard worker of the
Hull House in Chicago, and an au-
thor of current pgilanthropical liter-
ature, will be the speaker. at the Stu-
dent Vespers Service in the First Bap-
tist Church, Bellefield and Bayard

Miss Addams has had experience in
many lines of interest to students.
After her graduation from college.
she spent two years studying in_ Eu-
rope. Upon her return she studied for
one year at the Women’s Medical Col-
lege in Philadelphia, where she made
a decision to take up social work.
City administrative problems were of
concern to her, for she served three
years as inspuector of streets in Chi-
cago. She also took part in “the for-
mation of the National Progressive
pafty in 1912. , ' \-

As it was ,necessary «to make ar-
rangements. for. Miss Addams coming
early in the summer, the Vesper Coun-
cil desires that all Pittstudents avail
themselves . of the opportunity. Spe-
cial music will be an additional fea-
ture of the meeting.

is being ;put_, up to the students ‘of

_According to a statement made by
the business manager, ‘the last two
issues have been run at :1 loss of

in, the students themselves. There
are not sufficient paid in yearly sub-
scriptions today to warrant future
publication. A D’ _

What the Panther needs is an in-
crease of 41,000‘ ~subs-criptlons. ' This
‘will put {the Panther back on its
feet and the remaining six issues

plans to conduct a subscription cam-
paign after the ﬁrst of the year,

The plot submitted by William
Gregory and Louis E. Itsccitz, both
students‘ in the School, of Dentistry.

of the drama. , __

The committee recommended that
“The unnamed zmanuscript by Wil-

best lends, itself to development and’

limitations to which, the club is’ sub-
ject.” It _ recommended that certain.

sesses t,he’_most merit andoffers the
greatest possibilities for production»
by the ‘Cap and Gown Club.

2_. To make any suggestions and
recommendations it may deem proper
and toinclude the same in its report
to the Graduate Manager of Student‘

Gregory, 9. student, in the , Dental
School, is a, member of the Psi Omega

Many of the letter men who play-

were present, including such men
as Dr. A. B. Wallg-ren, ‘ “Didk” Wal-

None of them have lost their love
for the ‘ game. v ‘

About. 400 attended

Freshman team, band, letter men of

all sports now in ‘school, cheerlead-
ers, assis-tantst managers, etc. The
banquet is an annual aﬂair, given
by Athletic, -Council in honor of the
team and the fact that three defeats
had been the lot of r the. Panthers
this year didn’t seemto discourage
the banqueters at all. One person,
who looked in the hall when the
hilarity was at its height, said
“What great achievements are these
people . celebrating?” -A 4 person
standing nearby, -said, "O, they are
celebrating over losing three games
this year.” It is a fact that it takes
more than temporary backsets to

Loss of games means little in the

two without whimpering mean a lot

A number of the ourtot-town letter

Col. ‘:.Ioe" Thompson and “Bob”
Peck” were’ two of the football stars
of bygone days who helped stir up the

.1921 Panthers toas ﬁghting pitch be-
fore the big games this year. Peck,
who is athletic director at Culver
Military Academy, -was here for the
W. & J. game and-as he happened in
the dressing room before the team
took the ﬁeld against W. & J._ “Pop”
Warner called on him for a- few
words. Those who heard “Bob” say
he showed the same old time ﬁght
in his talk that -made him A1l-Ameri-
can center here, a player. He told
the boys that when he heard of the
Lafayette defeat he actually cried.

For the State game, Coach Warner
called on "Colonel “Joé” who was in
ﬁghting trim and what he said to the
boys was enough to stir their blood to
fever‘ heat. “Joe” is one _of the
“grads" who doesirt believe in send-
ing a team in with the idea that it is
the “under dog.” He wants them to
go in conﬁdent that they can “lick
their weight in wild cats” and his talk
was along that, line Thanksgiving Day.
It undoubtedly did a lot to put the
boys (in, the right trim mentally——in
fact, it is said to have sent the chills
up the backs of all of them. “Joe"
was also a headliner ata student as-
sembly the week of the game and he
stirred "up the undergrads in a way
that no other Pittite can, with ,the
possible exception or “Al” Hamilton.
More power to “Old Joe." He is for
Pitt ﬁrst, last and all the time.

At L the 1 Sunset Dinner in 1920,
after a previous discussion during

the holiday luncheon the winter be-

fore, it was decided th-at the wom-
en members of the Alumni Associa-
tion should be asked to pledge s*1i:1Jl-
port to ﬁnancing a “Cot;ta.g.e House”
for non-resident women students. in
the University. ‘The committee in
charge, Alpha Burkart, chairman,
Lassisted by Hazel Keﬁer Peden, '15,
and Dale Finley, Dunham, * ’1_2,/ was
most bsursy the“ following summer
and fall hunting down tithe-.Lﬁrs.t re-
quisite to such an A plan, the * “cot-
tage,” but with such real estate con-
ditions as existed in Pittsburgh, and
especially in the Oakland and Belle-
ﬁeid districts, it was impossible: to
get anywhere with > the previous
plans. Then this spring it was voted

to devote -the funds pledged to fur-
nishing the girls-’ rest room in Alum-.

ni Hall-. The committee has made
its detailed -report to the Year
Chairman, which will be read and
acted upon later. Those who have
visited Alumni Hall since the be-
ginning of- the current semester
know that Miss Burkarts and her
-committee have furnished the room
in ex uisite Ltaste: ' the furniture is
baronil Brown willow with cretonne
-cushions, the rugs taupe velvet. and
the hangings cretonne. When the
report is read in full, eveny one in
terested will agree that Alpha and‘
whoever helped her to do the buy-
ing are qualiﬁed to act as» purchasi

» ing agents for any pr.LospectivLe home-

maker. L L - L
Meanwhile -gthe committee has ﬁn-

ishedlits’ job with us, -but we have

not ﬁnished ours with the commit-
tee, for the committee acted 
the. expectation, that every I pledge
without exception would (be paid as

pledged. The balance of the bill

stands in the name of the Commit-
tee Chairman, and T must to paid im-

mediately. The committee gave its

money and time, which was-not in-
considerable, cheerfully and without
la.gging._ Surely we .-30311’ " give our
small pledges the same way.

preciate the gift. A 'l‘hey~ would if
they were to -stand in the offing

was none . in State.  It was with
thought of all this that thegirlsv-tout

sonality and that charming vocal
quaver that denotes the dar,ky’s\ mel-
ancholy. Incidentally, he will sing, his
latest songs. They are “Songs We
Can’t Forget,” “The Men_F-‘.'rom: Dixie-
land,” -“Mammy Byes” and “C-Lleo,”
which are said to be Worthy succes-
sors to the songs that made him fa-
mous, “Roly Boly Byes,” “Ida, Sweet

big ideas brought  out in Richard

. Barthelmessf powerfully human pho-

toplay, “Tol’aable,Dav-id,”L which is to
be presented all next week, starting
Monday morning, December :12, at the
Million Dollar Grand, Pittsburgh.- The
film is .o/ne of the most he-art-reaching
offerings that has ever reached the
screen, being a classic in homey real‘-‘
ism, quaint humor, dramatic suspense,
irresistible pathos, and true, lovable
humanness. -The basis of the produc-
tion is the famous novel of the same
name by Joseph Herge~nsheimer, and
it offers the ﬁn.estL rye and most
soul-stirring‘ charactgization in \ the
history of Barthelmess’ ‘successes. ‘

“To1’ab1e David") is Barthelmess’
debut as a [star for Ashe First Na-
tional Exhibitors? Circuit. LFor two
years he has been starring under the
expert tutelage of David’  Griffith,
‘winning a vast number of -L friends
with -his work, in “Way Down East,”
.“Broken B1oss'dms,”' “The ‘Idol
Dancer,” “Scarlet 'Day_sL.,”L and others.
And this experience has made of -him
anL artist whom many critics are ac-.
claiming the ‘ greatest dramatic) actor
of the ﬁlms today. This is borne out

itself ‘open to legal censu
and is staged by Mr. Leonard, lwho

CIINVENTIIIN      

« Dr. Charles Reitell, head of Ae-
counting Department of the Univer-
sity and Prof, Audrey L. Ashby, al-
so of the University, were among
the speakers who addressed the
delegates to the convention of the
American Institute of Accountants
at the William Penn Hotel, Satur-
day. V '
“The accountants have a wonder-
ful ﬁeld before them, ‘much like pre-
ventive medicine is to leaders in
that ﬁeld. For the relation between
business law and accountants -and
auditors is ‘becoming closer and
more fundamental evbry days We
are now in a transition period when
there will be a. segregation of cor-
porations. and the accountant doing
«constructive work must understandl
"the fundamental basis of the lawi
underlying all transactions,” declared’
Professor Ashlby to the delegates at-
tending the American Institute ‘gOf
Accountants’ regional convention, Sat-
urday. ' v’
“Auditors Lmust certify to the cor-
rectness of all reports made by cor-
porations, which shows the impor-
tance of their work, and we must be
prepared to meet many new_ legal
questions, such: as‘ the system of
consigning goods by manufacturers
so as ,to_ control. prices beyond the
first buyer. The new- -philosophy of
the accountant must be constructive
and with the fundamentals properly
observed we will have a better and
closer relation between the profes-

said. L L _ _

Other speakers yesterday were
Dr. Charles Reitell of the University
of 'PiLtLtsburgh,L William  Bell of
New» York and P, ‘A. -Kennedy, _ for-

.,Lgeneral’s department of vPennsyl-
Avania; .A dinner was given in , :the
hotel last night, at which the speak-
-ers were Daniel .‘C'. Roper, ‘former
United States: Commissioner of in-_
ternal revenue;” Dr. J. T. Holds-
worth, vice president of - the"Bank
of Pittsburgh, N. A.; . T. Edward
Ross, member of the American Ins-
titute of Accountants, and M. Hoke
-the statistics
and information bureau of Pennsyl-
vania. CL. P. Collins. of Pittsburgh,
was toastmaster. L The -committee in
charge follows: -Harry Watkin-s,
-chairman, and these officers of the

Ernest Crowther, president; E. C.
Gause, first A vice ‘president: L. P.
Collins-,: second vice president; 0.
G. Richter, secretary, and J. A. Mac-
Lean, treasurer;

“Colossal -changes have taken‘
place in every important industry in
the last 20 years whichhave caused
revolutions in accountants’ cost pro-
cedure,” said Dr. Reitel1.LL “We've
shifted from the muscular to the
system of mental energy.. This is
aresult of the Wide use of machinery
‘in industry.iAnd America is following
Britain‘ in standarizing equipment,
processes ' and commodities, thus
~making for a more universal stand.-

in -scientiﬁc management point to re-

“There is notone industry in which
