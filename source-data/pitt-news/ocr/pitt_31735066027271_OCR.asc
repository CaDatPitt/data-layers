New amendments may bring clarity to crime reports

Anne Estonilo

New rules for campus crime reports are
forcing universities across the state to pro-
vide students and employees with legible
and accessible crime statistics in their
updates.

The newly-drafted amendments are
detailing a clear fomrat for how institutions
should infonn people about crime, and are
going so far as to require the abbreviations
in reports to be explained.

The ﬁrst regulations were authored by

 

Sen. Richard Trlghman in 1994 in response
to a murder at Lehigh University. The par-
ents of the victim lobbied for access to more
information on crime on campus as a result
of the murder.

“[The rules] were created to help stu-
dents and student perspectives get a clear
and consistent scope of information about
crime on campus,” Press Secretary Sean
Duffy said.

According to Duffy, additional changes
were made to the 1994 College and
University Security regulations as a result of
a series of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette articles

on illegible and poor crime reports.

“The Post-Gazette found a number of
institutions were not ﬁlling [crime] logs leg-
ibly or in a complete way,” Duffy said.
“This led the State Board of Education to
adopt new rules that give colleges a stan-
dardized form for reports and help them
comply.”

According to sources at the Post-
Gazette, Pitt was not one of the institutions
with poor crime log practices. Sources indi-
cated the logs “appeared in good shape” and
had an “acceptable fonnat.”

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said the

amendments will have little effect on Pitt’s
current crime reporting practices.

“What the state legislature has added
will require me to provide a map that shows
the campus boundaries and the numbers for
Zones 6 and 2, for those who want to take it
one more step,” Boyd said.

Zones 2 and 6 are the city of
Pittsburgh’s police departments which
cover parts of the Oakland area and overlap
with the campus police’s jurisdiction.

According to Boyd, Pitt already pro-
vides crime statistics and rates in their armu—

Luminous
display
sparks
interest in
neon art

____Christene Muller

The Conney M. Kimbo
Gallery is catching the atten-
tion of more Pitt students
with its luminescence.

The gallery is host to a
neon art display, which runs
from Jan. 2] to Feb. 8.

Ian Milnes, a three-
month-old baby, was capti-
vated by the neon art in the
Kimbo Gallery in the
William Pitt Union. The baby
was crying but stopped and
just stared at the neon lights
and the reflections on the
glass when his mother
brought him into the room.

It was just as inviting to
his mother, Sheila Milnes of
Squirrel Hill, who loved the
offbeat feel of the artwork.

“Wouldn’t it make a
great night—light?” she said.

The artists who created
the artwork, Rebecca
Schuchert and Tracy
Alsedek, have been making
neon art for over l() years.
The husband and wife own
their own business called

Katie Fischer, Art Director, brings neon to the Kimbo gallery.

Sparky’s Neonworks.

Alsedek considers his
work “fun.” Their “funky
neon sculptures” have differ-
ent artistic styles thrown in
with the bright, glowing neon
lights.

Michael Schwartz, a
junior at Pitt, finds it differ‘-
ent from traditional art.

“I find it eccentric, but
not ‘weird‘ because weird
implies some psychological
disturbance. Eccentricity
implies brilliance,” Schwartz
said.

Not every one would

Christene Mtrﬁmf , p  

agree with Schwartz on his
intellectual ideas, but most
would agree with him when
he said it was beyond his
price range.

The neon art is pricey.
The cheapest sculptures start
at $165 for a guitar and range
as high as $1,600 for a free-
standing column.

Schuchert said that the
sculptures last for decades,
and if they do burn out, they
can be recharged.

P|lT TV plugs into dorms
as infochannel this fall

Students living in the domrs
may soon ﬁnd themselves turning
on the television to ﬁnd out what’s
happening on campus.

PITT-TV, the brainchild of
former Student Govemment Board
member Cyrus Zolghadri, will ﬁrst
appear this fall and will be avail-
able to all students in the residence
balls with basic TCI cable pro-
gramming. The station will pre-
miere as an infochannel, and will
feature either a scrolling or a still-
ﬁame style.

“You have to start some-
where,” Zolghadri said. “You have
to learn how to crawl before you
can walk.”

Zolghadri ﬁrst came up with
the idea for the station during the
retreat for last year’s SGB mem-
bers.

“I remember asking if anyone
had ever thought of a Pitt TV sta-
tion, and when I found out that no
one had, the idea was off and run-
ning,” he said.

Zolghadri’s proposal to the
administration deﬁned the channel
as “sewing the University commu-
nity by providing information on
campus activities, athletics, special
events, news, weather, food ser-
vices, housing, registration, and

other important service or commu-
nity armouncements.” It will be run
by a student coordinator, who will
program the channel, and student
employees, who will keep the
channel running.

“The station is a good way to
be able to communicate with the
students immediately,” Zolghadri
said. “Students will only have to
ﬂip on the television to know
what’s going on around campus
and can ﬁnd out important infor-
mation as soon as it comes out.”

Zolghadri, who was recently
named the director of PITI‘-TV,
doesn’t work on this project alone.
Brandy Miller, a current SGB
member, was officially assigned to
the project during January’s SGB
retreat.

“I had heard about the project
last year through my work with the
Allocations Committee,” Miller
said. “I had been very interested in
the idea and often talked to Cyrus
about it.”

After being named to the
PITI”-TV project, Miller began to
work side-by-side with Zolghadri
to see that the idea of PITT-TV
would become a reality. Cunently,
two—thirds of the funding has been
secured for the station.

“We brainstormed to come up
with several departments that

Nevertheless, he said the map outlining
campus boundaries and the phone numbers
of pertinent city police departments will be
posted regardless of whether the new
amendments are approved.

Despite the stricter regulations, Boyd
said he felt the media had the greatest
impact on educating people on campus. He
criticized The Pitt News police blotter, say-
ing it didn’t accurately portray the crime on
campus.

Boyd said the problem with the blotter
was that on a given day, one published inci-
dent about indecent exposure doesn’t reflect
other calls the Pitt Police received for the
day, thereby misleading readers about
crime.

Boyd suggested The Pitt News publish
a monthly summary of crime on campus to
help educate the campus.

Boyd also suggested that those interest-

ed in crime statistics and rates on campus
can ﬁnd information in the Uniform Crime
Reports, a publication formatted by the FBI
and the Pennsylvania State Police. He said
anyone can walk into the Pitt Police station

and request. to see the book. The UCR is

also available at Hillman Library and is
compiled by year.

An additional service the Pitt Police
subscribe to is the Consortium for Higher
Education Campus Crime Research. The
CHECCR is paid by the Pitt Police to com-
pile data on campus crime rates. Boyd said
he would also make that information avail-

’ able to interested students.

carmot be acquired by the public. Boyd said
these carmot be made available because
some are open cases currently under inves-
tigation. When certain circumstances occur,
such as an insurance company requesting
police reports, the Pitt Police require a letter
from the insurance company, and the report
is sent directly to the company.

What is available to students and
employees are summaries of the crimes and

incidents. These cite the date, time, and inci-.

dent that occurred.

‘ The new amendments drafted and
approved on Jan. 9 by the State Board of
Education must still go through a standard
process before they can be submitted to the
Independent Regulatory Review
Commission, which gives the ﬁnal
approval. If approved, the new revision will
take effect within the next few months.

Duffy said there should be no reason
for universities to delay compliance with the
regulations. Duffy said the colleges and uni-
versities were supplied with sample forms
of the regulations to provide time to make
changes. Duffy said the amendments will be
approved because they simplify the way
crime reports are done.

While campuses may be fined for non-
compliance, Duffy said complaints will be
referred to the Attorney General’s oﬁice if
the universities act in “willful and persis-
tent” violation of the regulations. Duify said
he does not expect to have any problems
with the schools, however.

“We’ve made it easier for them to com-
ply,” Duffy said. “There’s no reason for
them not to.” e

sending our proposals to them,” Miller said.

SGB President Justin DalMolin said
that none of the money raised came ﬁom
Student Activities. “We wanted to make sure
that we didn’t take away from funds that had

been designated for student groups,” he said .

Zolghadri stressed that PI'IT-TV is just
the foundation for something much greater
. “You have to start somewhere,” he said.
“Hopefully, PITT-TV will eventually feature
live broadcasts with camera equipment, live
sporting events, maybe even a system with
pay-per-view movies. The possibilities are
endless once you have something estab-
lish .”

In his research, Zolghadri discovered
that many universities that started out with
infocharmels blossomed into much more
diverse stations. ’ ’

“Michigan started with a basic comput-
er, and now has 250 members on their stu-
dent television staff. California University of
Pa. started with an infochannel, and now
they have a news truck to go out and cover
news on the scene,” he said. “We have much
higher expectations than just the infochan-
ne .”

Miller also said that she hoped to pass
her involvement on to someone on next

year’s board to keep the ball rolling.

“If we keep assigning someone each
year on SGB to the PI'IT-TV project, our
aspirations of making it something bigger
and better have a better chance of happen-
mg.”

When Pl'IT-TV is launched this fall, it
will be based in the William Pitt Union next
to Telefact. The computer ‘brain’ that will

dormitories. Students who live off campus
will be able to access the station through the

“It’s impossible for TCI to isolate the
Oakland community with the channel, “
Zolghadri said. “Because the station is run
by a computer ‘brain,’ it will also beneﬁt
those who live off campus if they choose to
access it by computer.”

As more and more people hear about
PITT-TV, more and more people are asking
questions about it. Zolghadri and Miller said
they keep motivating each other to make

sure that the station begins smoothly in the

fall.

“All it takes to get this off the ground is
an initiative and some energy,” Zolghadri
said. ‘This channel is going to bring our stu-
dents closer together.”

Prevention — the sniffling
ochy stuffy headache so
you can rest medicine

Srcorleﬂe gorbin

 

The Pitt Plagues are back. Along
with the cold winds of winter come the
ﬂu bugs that sweep through the dorms
and classrooms every year.

There’s no cure, but you can help
prevent it.

According to Donna Weber, a
Student Health Service staff nurse, the
first step is to try to protect yourself
from the various viruses that are going
around. This can be done through a
number of ways.

“The number-one way to prevent
catching a virus is to wash your hands
often, for about 10 to 15 seconds at a
time,” Weber said.

This is a big issue when it comes to
using objects that are communal, such
as books in a library or terminals in the

computer lab. This is how many stu—-

dents are infected each year.

Although constantly washing your
hands may sound like a mundane
method of prevention, or worse, a seri-
ous case of over—reaction, it is one of
the most important steps to take when
fighting off a virus. Not washing your
hands is the easiest way to catch a cold
or the flu, and washing hands is the
easiest way to prevent them.

“Another big reason students get
sick is through a weakened immune
system. This can be caused by stress,
lack of sleep, and not eating healthy,”
Weber said.

As all students know, avoiding
stress, sleeping well, and eating health-
ily are on the order of performing mir-
acles when you have classes, papers,
and exams to worry about.

On the other hand, getting sick just
throws in another problem when you’re
knee-deep in classwork. The days of
staying home from school and watch-
ing cartoons when you’re sick are
unfortunately over. Getting sick now is

 

5

not only an aggravation, but also a
common reason why so many students
have trouble keeping their grades up.

“We don’t encourage students not
to go to class. We feel you are adults,
and can determine whether or not you
are well enough to attend class,” Weber
said.

Every semester many students go
to Student Health requesting written
excuses for the classes they missed.
Unless your clinician advises you not
to attend, Student Health will not issue
an excuse for missed classes.

If you think you may already have
a cold or the ﬂu, just try to rest, drink
as many ﬂuids as possible, and take
some kind of pain reliever such as
aspirin,-Tylenol or Ibuprofen. And if
you smoke, stop or decrease your
intake, because it will only make mat-‘
ters worse.

There is not much else that can be
done. Contrary to popular belief,
antibiotics do not help, because both
colds and the flu are caused by viruses.
So, going to Student Health and
demanding medication will do you no
good.

There are also many warning signs
that are associated with having a cold
or the ﬂu which can really be symp-
toms for something else. If you have
any of these symptoms, you should
seek medical care: a fever of 101
degrees, more than 2-3 days of hard
coughing spells, swollen glands,
wheezing, earaches, asthma, chronic
bronchitis, or a history of rheumatic

-fever, rheumatic heart disease, or pneu-

monia.

Unless you have one of the above-
mentioned symptoms, it’s best just to
try to muddle through until the end of
the season. With a little prevention and
a lot of luck, many of us may be able to
avoid getting sick, and in turn, make
classwork just a little more bearable
this semester.

WASHINGTON, D.C. —— Not
everyone has the good life hand-
ed to them and sometimes the
American dream can seemunat—
tainable. Yet most people still
strive for it in some way.

All the manifestations of the
American Dream came out at the
inauguration ~ the death of that
dream was also in evidence.

There were protesters carry-
ing signs that read everything
from, “Bill Clinton’s Washington
is fag capitol of the world,” to
“Bill Clinton, how can you call
yourself a Christian when you
hang outwith fags?”

They were standing out in
front of the Capitol during the

President’s inauguration, but .

they weren’t kicked out. In fact,
three police officers stood there

The oﬁicers said they were pro-
tecting their First Amendment
rights.

While the police were pro-
tecting the protestors, other offi-
cers were busy arresting a home-
less man to take him to a shelter.

Apparently not everyone’s
rights were being protected.

Jack Belane is a Vietnam
Vet who makes his money pan-
handling near the capitol and
speaks his mind about what he
feels are government injustices.
For this reason he was being
kicked out of the Capitol. The
police were taking him away to a
shelter in Landover, Md., to
“ rotect him from the cold,” as
one of the oﬁicers said.

“We just don’t want to ﬁnd
him dea ,” said Officer ‘Bill
Fortage of the Capitol City
Police. ‘

It was 42 degrees outside,
and there were several shelters

protecting them from being
pummeled by angry passers by.

Life for some in D.C. is an American nightmare

Russ Krebs

 

WASHINGTON, D.C. —— Huddled masses
nonnally dot Dupont Circle. The homeless
of Washington D.C. tend to congregate here,
as they do in many other places where a coin
is likely to be ﬂipped by a passerby. _

The American dream has passed these
people by. Their only hope for sustenance is
the good hearts of others.

But amazingly, during inauguration
weekend they’ve all disappeared -— only
the truly stubbom ones remain, and they are
few and far between.

Did D.C. Mayor Marion Barry use his
political prowess to begin helping the home-
less just prior to the inauguration? Were they
all enrolled in programs to straighten out
their lives? Has somebody ﬁnally come up
with a solution to the problems of the home-
less?

No. No. No.

Millions of people ﬂock to our nation’s
capitol during inauguration. Our capitol is an
image of freedom and prosperity to the rest
of the world. If people coming to see the
inauguration ﬁnd the homeless on every cor-
ner, that doesn’t exactly invoke a sense of
pmspenty.

So, once every four years, the police
take an active role in bettering the lives of the
homeless. Despite the existence of several

- a., .» on ‘H «.1 one ;,...,.i¢.o s.«.4»~-vb.» at ¥<0 awed.‘ ~u»iuw-w s-

h.~vlIyd'tVil§ 9 . 4.

shelters within the city, most homeless end
up in the outlying areas where they can’t eas-
ily return to the city.

Jack Belane, a 40-year-old Vretnarn Vet
who has been homeless for the past 16 years,
knows about this all too well.

Last Saturday, Belane was standing out-
side of the Capitol Building, begging for

change and ranting about government injus- <

tices to anyone who would listen. The police
came twice during the clay and took him to a
homeless shelter 35 blocks away to keep him
from returning. He walked the distance back
each time and eventually got to stay, speak
his mind, and try to get money to live on.

“I don’t want to live on the streets,”
Belane said. “I was really messed up when I
came back from ‘Nam, and before I knew it,
I had lost everything.”

He said he would love nothing more
than to become a productive member of
society again.’

“I want to work for my money and not
have to rely on others, but you can’t do that
if you don’t have no address,” Belane said.

Sharon Brak Kelly has been homeless
for four years and lives on the streets of the
Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.,
trying to make enough money to pay for her
medicine.

“I try to work, but people are scared to
hire me. They think [the homeless are] irre-
sponsible,” she said.

vr “l’r"»\«-"\ c .m 4... at

She said she makes the best of what she
has and thinks eventually things will change
for her.

“I have faith,” Kelly said.

Some people may think that panhan-
dlers make a lot of money, but Barbara
Jones, also of the Georgetown streets, said
she doesn’t make much.

“Not enough to get an apartment, a
roorrr. That’s why I’m here,” she said.

Not all homeless people stay on the
streets all day long in Washington D.C.
Some of them ride the subway all day to stay
warm and to avoid being taken away during
the inauguration.

Bob Jansek is one of these people.
J ansek used to work for the government until
budget cuts sent him packing. Now, he can
be seen on any number of subway cars since
the inauguration patrol kicked him out of his
street home of Dupont Circle.

Sitting on the train, Jansek spots a news-
paper on the ground and crawls over to pick
it up. He reads the headlines aloud to himself
and seems completely content.

He takes out a briefcase and starts leaf-
ing through papers. All of them are memos
and letters addressed to or written by him on
government letterhead from 1992 and 1993.
He said he feels important with the briefcase,
and added that people respect him more
because he carries it. When asked how he felt

College Democrats party and
talk politics in nation's capital

Politics and partying. The College
Democrats of America learned how to play
that game in the big town over the inaugur-
al weekend. _

In a downtown nightclub in D.C. that
spoke of wealth and posh society, young
Democrats from across the East Coast wan-
dered in and out of rooms and up and down
stairs, holding cups ﬁlled to the brim with
beer and hard liquor while trying not to
bump into sweaty bodies moving to the
music. Everyone was having a good time
— some a little too good, as revealed by
their eyes and slurred speech.

Despite the intense party scene, most
students were eager to talk politics, espe-
cially the politics oonceming Clinton and
administration. People
expressed genuine concern about the possi-
bility of having another four years of con-
stant friction and bickering between the
president and Congress, and they were
looking to Clinton to prevent that from hap-
pening.

“IthinkClinton [hasthe ability] toseta
precedent for future presidents,” said Jim
Canauos, a senior from the University of
North Carolina at Wﬂniington. “I assume
he will try to use a bringing—together
process to get as much done as possible.”

Christopher Anderson and Charles
Mathews, both - juniors at Colgate
University in New York state, also looked
to the second term as a time for cooperation
because they feared another budget crisis.

“I hope for a lot more cooperation in
balancing the budget,” ‘stated Mathews.
“This is his chance to make a legacy and to
do something important for history. I don’t
see any good ideas, though.”

While students spoke of bipartisan pol-
itics and politicians and their rhetoric, edu-
cation was the hot topic of the night. Some
commented on their large college debts and
how they hope Clinton can go further in
promoting more generous scholarship,
grant, and loan programs.

“The direct student loan program
should be expanded,” commented Brian
Cross of the University of Illinois at
Springﬁeld. “Unfortunately, the
Republicans did not support it, but with
Clinton in for another four years, there
should be an effort made.”

Jeremy Smith of the University of
Rochester said that education directly
relates to Clinton’s symbolic bridge to the
21st century.

“Education is the number-one goal,
because without educating the public you
can’t go anywhere as a nation. The econo-
my issue is also impoitant, but education
has a direct inﬂuence on that.”

Tony Kuhel, of George Washington
University, also got in on the debate by say-
ing that he hopes Clinton will accomplish

 

his pledge to be the education president he
claims to be.

Some other issues that continued to
crop up in conversations throughout the
night were the traditional concerns for the
environment and the homeless, but such
topics as welfare, Social Security, campaign
ﬁnance reform, health care, and, oddly
enough, foreign policy also seemed preva-
lent.

“I hope they work out the welfare sys-
tem and make stronger enviromnental
laws,” said Kasey Shewe, a 1996 graduate
of Duke University who now works for the
American Geological Institute, while
Carilyn Sparks, of Wellesley College in
Massachusetts, stated that progress made in
health care reform was something she
wanted to see happen in the next four years.

“Clinton’s working in the right direc-
tion now when it comes to foreign policy.
Hc’s not waﬁling like he used to, and he
now realizes that foreign policy makes an
impact on domestic policy,” Anderson
commented when asked about the issue of
foreign policy.

Many students expressed concern over
the Social Security system and questioned
whether they would be able to collect social
security when it came time for them to
retire. One graduate from George
Washington University laughed while sug-
gesting that Clinton should abolish Social
Security and forget his anti—smoking cm-
sade.

‘”They’re both related [Social Security
and smoking] because many old people die
from tobacco. Promote smoking and you
won’t need social security.”

When asked who they voted for last
election, the overwhelming majority said
Clinton, because they could identify with
him much better than Dole.

‘The largest demographic gap in the
‘96 presidential election,” said David Ford
of American University, “was the age gap.
There was a 22-point difference in voters
between 18 and 25.”

While college students had a tendency
to vote for Clinton, many were not over-
joyed with Clinton as the Democratic can-
didate.

“It wasn’t that I voted for Clinton,” said
Ralmy Kamons, a junior environmental
studies major at Dartmouth. “It was more
like I voted against Dole.”

Other students said much the same
thing. Kuhel voted for Clinton because
Dole was old and, as a result, out of touch
with young people.

However, there were others who felt
that Clinton, without a doubt, was the right
man for the job.

“I feel encouraged about his second
administration,” said Darren Glatt, a junior
accounting major from George Washington
University. “I mean he’s done good things,
He's a young president and I hope he does
more things for the young.”

s fall to visiting Providence

Lady Panther

 

The Pitt Lady Panthers dropped to 2-7
in Big East play after they let their game last
night against the Providence Lady Friars slip
away.

Pitt shot only 38 percent from the ﬁeld
in the second half as the Lady Friars pulled
away to a 78-65 victory.

The Lady Panthers played without both
of their starting guards. Gina Montesano
missed another game because of an injured
knee she suffered Jan. 6, and JoJo Guzman

sat on the bench much of the game because
she broke a team rule.

The game started out rocky for Pitt.
Providence hit two three-pointers to go up
10-2 in the ﬁrst four minutes.

The Lady Panthers had trouble with the
Lady Friars’ screen-oriented offense in the
ﬁrst half. Providence drained four ﬁrst-half
bombs en route to a 37-35 lead going into the
locker room.

The only reason Pitt stayed close was
their inside play. Latia Howard and Nickeia
Morris combined for 14 points in the paint.

The Lady Panthers missed three layups
in the first minute of the second half to seal
their fate. Their poor shooting in the second
half led Providence to outscore them by ll
in the second stanza.

Poor foul shooting also plagued the
Lady Panthers throughout the second half.
They managed to shoot only 37 percent
from the charity stripe for the game.

Had they made some early buckets and
hit their late foul shots, the Lady Panthers
could have rim away with this game, but

THURSDAY

Sir-DowN

Sports Editor Matt Grove gets the scoop from concerned students

TPN: If you were the new Athletic Director at
Pitt, what would be your ﬁrst order of busi-
ness?

A: First we would hire Brett Favre as the new
football coach because he’s cute and more
women would come to the games; on top of
that women spend money, and that would be
great for Pitt. Then we would help Rocky
Bleier out of debt by making him the new
equipment manager.

TPN: If you could play any sport for Pitt, what
would it be and why?

A: We would start a bowling team because any-
one can bowl. You don’t have to be a star ath-
lete. Plus, we really like those cool rental
shoes. If you watch bowling on TV, there are

always a lot of people in the crowd, and when
the team isn’t having games Pitt could rent it
out to students for social events. It’s really a
great idea if you think about it.

TPN: In your opinion, why can’t Pitt attract the
best high school players in the country to come
here?

A: That’s easy. Oakland smells a lot like
garbage, it’s foul. Other schools are a lot pretti-
er; they have beautiful trees and a fresh ﬂower-
garden scent. We think athletes enjoy trees.
TPN: What do you think of Pitt mascot “Roc?”
A: We think he’s cute. Do you think he’s busy
on Valentine’s Day? Really, it’s great for a team
to have someone like him getting people excit-
ed at games.

Mass confusion surrounds
Panthers trip to Kent State

es“ M°.<?'<.__ .

53°,’

 

The men’s and women’s track meet last
weekend at Kent State University resembled
an episode of “The X Files” as much as it did
an athletic event. Everything that could have
gone wrong did, and some of Pitt’s women
were the primary victims.

One of the Panthers’ goals for the meet
was to get both the men’s and women’s dis-
tance medley relay teams qualiﬁed for post-
season championship meets. The men’s
team of Scott Cuny, Scott Gilpen, Carl
Taylor, and Rich Walsh ran ﬁrst. They won
their race and easily qualiﬁed for the IC4A
championship with a time of 10: 10.30.

The women’s team had it tougher. The
first leg of the relay consisted of three laps.
As the leaders, including Pitt’s Angie Martin,
came by the third time, oﬂicials rniscounted
the number of laps they had run and added
an extra lap to the ﬁrst leg. Officials made up
for the mistake by subtracting a lap from the
next leg, but never told anyone until it was
time for the next runners to hand off.

As a result of all the confusion, nmners
couldn’t pace themselves properly and times
were slow. Pitt had two teams in the race.
One ﬁnished in 12:26.20; the other in
12:33.60. The time needed to qualify for the
ECAC championship meet is 12:18.8.

“That really was a shame because that
was the best race they’ve run,” said Pitt
Assistant Coach Dave Sobal. “I’m still a lit-
tle upset about that.”

The rest of Pitt’s distance team had a
pretty good day. Stephanie Ellsworth won
the women’s 5000 meters in 17:39.00, qual-
ifying for the ECAC meet by 0.8 seconds.

 

Amy Francy’s time of 18:38.60 earned her
third place in the race.

For the men, Scott Gilpen, Ralph
Courtemanche, and Carl Taylor all fmished
in the top six at 800 meters. All three were
under 1:58. Ed Adarnson and Matt Samuel
were the top two collegiate ﬁnishers in the
5000 meters with times of 1521220 and
15:24.50, respectively.

As usual, Pitt’s shorter relay teams and
hurdlers also had good days. The biggest
problem for them was the fact that the elec-
tronic timing system wasn’t working, so
times had to be taken using the less accurate
and less efficient thumb-and-stopwatch
method. .

. Orrel Green won the men’s 55-meter

hurdles in 7.40 seconds, but he couldn’t
quite bring home a Pitt victory in the nrile
relay. Pitt frrrished second to Kent State in
that event with 3: 16.90, 0.2 seconds behind.

“Kent State has a monster quarter-nriler.
He caught Orrel on the last straightaway,”
Sobal said

The Panthers took the top two slots in
the women’s mile relay. Pitt’s two teams had
times of 3:47.30 and 3:55.50, both of which
meet the qualifying standard for the ECAC
meet. Pitt also had four of the top eight
women in the 55-meter hurdles and the 200-
meter hurdles.

Next weekend, Pitt’s teams travel to
Boston. The meet features the stitfest com-
petition Pitt has faced yet this season. It was
supposed to be an opportunity for the
Panthers to compete individually against
tough competition, but another goal will
once again be to get the women’s distance
medley team qualiﬁed for the ECAC charn-

pionship meet.

Coach Bruce spoke of all the missed
opporttmities. He said, “You can’t do that and

Pitt had a lot of matchup problems tonight.
They could not play man defense well, but
Coach Bruce did not want to go to the zone
because Providence is such a good shooting
team.

While Providence ran away with the
game, they put ﬁve players in double ﬁgures.
Keni Chatten led the way for the Lady Friars
with 17, followed by Nadine Malcolm and
Maghan Hinds with 15 apiece.

Latia Howard and Nickeia Mom's were
the big stories for Pitt. Howard ﬁnished with 18
points and seven rebounds. She led the Lady
Panthers’ charge back, but she was also a vic-
tim of the missed shot, as she was 9-20 from

_ the ﬁeld.

Although Howard ﬁnished 9-20, her
coach said, “She could have been 14-16.”

The freshman, Monis, chipped in a dou-
ble-double. She ﬁnished with 10 points and 12
rebounds. These numbers should help Pitt a

Coach Bruce said of Monis, “She had a
nice pass to Latia [Howard] one time. She can
help us, and I think she has decided she is going
to help us. She outplayed their big girl tonight.”

Another ﬁeshman, Michelle Katkowski,
also had a big night for the home team. She fm-
ished with 11 points, but this number does not
tell the whole story.

Katkowski found herself in the starting
lineup when the coaching staff benched
Guzman. She led the Lady Panthers by exam-
ple with her hustle and determination. Any time
there was a loose ball, Katkowski was on the
ﬂoor. She gave Pitt a big boost tonight.

Coach Bruce said, “It was Shelley’s
opportunity, and she did all right.”

After the game, Pitt had a 30-minute team
meeting. Coach Bruce said, “We talked about
quite a few things. I did, they did. It was a good
airing—out kind of a thing. We are still a team.‘
That’s how we do it.”

The Lady Panthers visit Georgetown next
Wednesday night to see if they can start to turn
things around. This is the time the team has to
get on a roll going into the Big East
Tournament.

Will favored Pack take care of business?

h

   

as

 

 

The greatest sporting event in the
world is coming up this weekend: the
Super Bowl. Many people are trying to
convince themselves that the New
England Patriots have any chance in the

world to win. Well I’m here to dispel.

any of these delusions of Patriot
grandeur.

The Green Bay Packers are a two-
touchdown favorite, and if I were a
Patriot fan, then I would hope that the
game stays that close. It won’t.

Let’s start on defense. The Green
Bay Packers have been ranked in the
top five in total defense all season long.

They’re not about to buck this trend. '

Drew Bledsoe is going to be having
nightmares of Reggie White bearing
down on him for months to come.
There is no glaring weakness in any
position on the cheesehead defense.
Most experts agree that for the Patsies
to win, they have to establish a solid
running game. Curtis Martin has been
successful all season against the
watered—down American Football
Conference competition. Well, this
weekend his streak of success stops.
His name will be added to a long list of
Pitt alumni who were good enough to

make it to the big game but not to win
It. '

The Packers’ offense is a well-oiled
machine, although they need a few min-
utes to get warmed up. The Pats match
up well here, but not well enough.
Granted, New England has held their
opponents to three ﬁeld goals in the last

two games, but as many Steeler fans_

know,‘ it was against the toothless
Steeler offense. I’m not sure what made
Willie McGinest drool more: seeing
“the ancient one,” Mike Tomczak,
under center, or Randall Cunningha...,
er, I mean Kordell Stewart.

Their other opponent was the
Jacksonville Jaguars, a good team in
their own right, but not the best team in
the AFC. All Head Coach Bill Parcells
had to do was keep offensive lineman
Tony Boselli occupied and make quar-
terback Mark Brunell beat their sec-
ondary. Mark Brunell is no Brett Favre.

Chris Slade, Ty Law, and the rest of
the Patsies’ defense are going to get
picked apart by the two—time defending
NFL Most Valuable Player Keith
Jackson across the middle, Edgar
Bennett in the ﬂat, Mark Chmura at the
sideline, Andre “Bad Moon” Rison
going deep  touchdown.

Can underdog Pats pull another Lexington?

F9 X._B'¢H¢h

The Patriots return to the Super
Bowl after 11 seasons. They are play-
ing at the Superdome, the same place
where they lost 45-10 to the Chicago
Bears in Super Bowl XX.

As in the last five years, everyone
is prepared for another NFC—dominat-
ed Super Bowl. The Packers are sup-
posed to bring the Vince Lombardi
trophy back to its place of birth with-
out any problems with the Pats. But, of
course, wasn’t it the great British

V Empire that expected to rout the

Patriots in the American Revolution?
As we all know, the Redcoats were
routed in the colonies and sent “pack-
ing” back to England.

The Patriots have more than his-
torical coincidences going for them.
The obvious advantage for the Patriots
is that they are the underdogs. They’re
under a lot less pressure than Green
Bay, who were picked in the preseason
to win the Super Bowl. The Patriots,
on the other hand, were a long shot to
reach the Super Bowl before the sea-
son. The large 14-point spread only
decreases the pressure on the Patriots.
The 13-year-long AFC curse doesn’t

help the Pats’ confidence, but it does _

 

help make them one of the largest
Superbowl underdogs.

One person who’s not a stranger to
being an underdog is Bill Parcells. He
was the Giants’ head coach in the 1990
season, when they upset the Buffalo
Bills with the Bills’ Scott Norwood.
Parcells also won a Super Bowl in the
1986 season by defeating the Broncos.

Quarterback Drew Bledsoe is an
important factor in this game. If he
makes only a few mistakes, the
Patriots have a good shot at winning
the game. If he throws an early inter-
ception, the game is as good as gone
for the Pats. He should throw only
high-percentage passes and not force a
ball into Green Bay’s opportunistic
secondary.

Former Pitt star Curtis Martin
needs to be able to run the ball early to
open up the passing game for Bledsoe.
With the Packers defense, Martin will
probably need to run for over a hun-
dred yards to give the Patriots a
chance. Number 28 should be able to
do so because the Patriot’s offensive
line has recently_ got some injured
players back.

The receiver corps of the Patriots
is, in my opinion, better than that of
the Packers. Ben Coates is the second-

Panther assistant coach
Payne going the extra mile

Brian Knavish  H

 

When Dan Payne was named
Pitt’s assistant wrestling coach last
year, he made organizing an off-sea-
son freestyle wrestling club foremost
on his list of priorities.

“I felt that organizing an off-sea-‘

son club along with recruiting was
essential in order for us to become a
top-10 team,” Payne said.

The result of Payne’s work is The
Pittsburgh Wrestling Club, which
concentrates its efforts on gaining
valuable experience for local
wrestlers.

“Everyone trains hard from
September to March [the collegiate
wrestling season],” Pitt Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “But the
guys who train hard from March to
September are the ones who will be
the upper-level wrestlers.”

Unlike most sports, wrestling has
two separate seasons. The freestyle
season begins after the regular sea-
son ends and continues for most of
the off-season. Freestyle wrestling is
completely separate from collegiate
wrestling, in which the athletes com-
pete under a totally different set of
rules.

The fact that freestyle wrestling
is not connected with the college
version of the sport is also a prob-
lem. It is not'University sponsored,
and the wrestlers must come up with
the funds.

The fees include coaching, trav-
el, and tournament entry fees. A sin-

 

gle international trip for the
wrestlers who qualify in national
tournaments may cost upwards of
$2,000.

“It is our goal to raise $10,000
for the wrestlers,” club President
Jack Withrow said.

While the club’s main focus is
Pitt grapplers, it is open to Pittsburgh
area wrestlers of all ages. Wrestlers
in the youth classifications up
through the middle— and high-school
classifications reap the benefits of
the club.

The club’s other goal is to raise
attendance at Pitt’s home matches.
The club is trying to make them
more fan—friendly events.

“We sponsor a tailgate party with
free hot dogs, T-shirts, and book
store gift certificates,” Withrow said.
“Fan support is vitally important to
the team’s success on the mat.’_’

Theclub is also sponsoring a
contest open to all University
groups. Whichever group brings the
most people, cumulatively, to the
next four home matches (today, Feb.
2, Feb. 15, and Feb. 23) wins a for-
mal dinner-cruise on the Gateway
Clipper.

Student membership in the club
is $5 and includes a T-shirt and
newsletter.

“There isn’t a doubt in my mind
that with the experience gained in
the off—season club, an EWL champi-
onship is possible within the next
couple of seasons,” Payne said.

Pitt’s next match is tonight at
home versus Cleveland State.

Anti-Fiag. hits the
natienal scene.
Hard.

Life’s a big circle. I used to be punk
rock; I used to have a radio show; I used
to be called Father Mike; I used to go to
shows; then, I grew up. Luckily, prior to
adulthood, the summer of ‘93 to be exact,
punk rock legends Millions of Dead
Cops came to town for a show at David
Lawrence Hall. Drunk and early, I caught
the opening band. After that, nothing
mattered — I had seen Anti—Flag.

If you’ve been to their shows, then
you know what I mean. If you saw them
four years ago, you really know what I
mean. If you haven’t seen them yet: go.
go, go!

Pittsburgh Fast Kid Punx, Anti—Flag,
are more than entertaining and offer
more than an aggressional outlet for life’s
initations — this is punk rock orgasm!
Their early performances were reminis-
cent of Mike Ness’s psychotic behavior
in the classic Social Distortion rocku—
mentaiy “Another State of Mind.” Anti-
Flag have enough “oh-oh’s” to rival
Naked Raygun and Screeching Weasel
combined! If this sounds like a bunch of
shit, it’s not. It’s in Print; it has to be
True. However, there’s proof. Ha!

Open up the Nov/Dec 1996 issue of
Flip Side magazine and you’ll ﬁnd a
review of an early August Mr. T
Experience show at 924 Gilman ST.
describing how Anti—Flag blew them off
the stage. This is the legendary punk co-
op club, the home, the backyard BBQ
that spawned Green Day, Rancid,
NOFX, and countless others. “Anti—Flag
were totally amazing!” wrote Flip Side’s
Athena Dread. “They really stole the
show.” In the article, she continues with,
“Anti—Flag is really one of the best bands
around now—a—days, mixing Clash type
melodies with everything from ska to
more rawk stuff. I’m totally into them,
and you should be too, because they’re
great!” Holy cow! And she’s not even
from Pittsburgh! 1996 got even more
exciting for Anti—Flag as two punk rock
giants, The Queers and the U.K. Subs,
had both asked them to join their respec-
tive tours. Look for A—F this summer
with label mates U.K Subs.

Label mates? Punkin’-A right, Anti-

Flag got signed. This is no regional local
bullshit “let’s pool our money so we can
make a CD” band, this is A—F! This is the
best thing punk label New Red Archives
ever could have done for itself! New Red
has been responsible for releasing punky
pleasures for years, and millions of
punks world wide are down with New
Red. In the past, this is the label that’s
been responsible for releasing MDC,
Swingin’ Utters, Samlam, U.K. Subs,
and many others. Their latest offering,
Anti-Flag’s Die For The Government, is,
by far, the best thing in their catalog.
Don’t worry about not being able to find
it, as New Red Archives have made these
pinko commie yinzer ﬂags world wide!
We’re talking U.S., Japan, Europe —
almost every record store! This means
“No Fear” for the Pitt punx studying
abroad. Semester at Sea fans are encour-
aged to pick up a copy in every country

they visit!
This isn’t a “what if  ﬁctional
band story. Free hipster mag, In

Pittsburgh, even missed the boat in this
year’s “Year—In-Review” issue. They
asked their writers what “local band”
would they like to see “make it,” and not
one of them said A-F. Big mistake.
They’ve been in the pages of Thrasher,

FLAG, PAGE 18 mm

ladies and gentlemen, we bring you the boys from Anti-Flag: Andy Flag, Pat Thetic, and Justin Sane.

 

but not in the pages of In Pittsburgh? Come on. Fast
Kid Punx Go Go Go!

Nicky Garratt, president of New Red Archives,
said, “I expect this CD to way out-sell The Swingin’
Utters CD which led the (Swingin’) Utters to be signed
to Fat (Wreck Chords), so who knows how far Anti-
Flag will go? This is just a tremendous CD and a great
band.” -

There’re no rose tinted glasses here. These guys
worked their asses off to get where they are. Dubbed
“the hardest working band in town” by many, they
embark on their third U.S. tour February 27th, a number
unparalleled by all local punk or mainstream bands out-
side of dirty hippies Rusted Root. Add in their Canadian‘
tour last summer, one or two smaller East Coast tours,

and a blistering, energetic, stage—vio_lent, always emo— -

tional, kill kill kill, live show, and you start to see why
these guys are getting all the attention. They Deserve It!

I Anti-Flag’s appeal lies in their eclectic material,
rhythmically and lyrically. As the name suggests, yes,
they are a political band. They question what national-

’ ism and patriotism really are in the ‘90s. Singer Justin
-Sane told me, “I’m not gonna’ go die, so some rich

fucker can make a million off of my blood selling
weapons and goods that make the war possible. On top
of that, many wars nowadays are just to protect some
multinational companies’ interests in a far off land.”
Right on! Government politics suck, but A-F also sing
about personal politics.

“I’m Feeling Slightly Violent” is a song that inves-
tigates the pain behind the, often unanticipated, fading
friendship: “... when I think about what we had, and
what you threw away, I start feeling sad and lonely, then
I think‘ you’re gonna pay. Down deep inside I don’t
want to hurt you, I just want you to see, all this fucking
agony that you’re dishing out on me ...”

This ability to tune in to their own emotional dark

sides is what makes Anti-Flag the trio of the decade. It’s
surely an element that will continue, in spite of their
current restructuring. Anti—Flag, the trio of the decade
restructuring? Sad but true, kids. Fellow lyricist/vocal-
ist and bassist, Andy Flag, quit the band after their
March ‘96 East Coast tour. It’s a subject I broached
Justin on as we sat at a West End milk bar. “Yeah, it
really sucked when Andy quit and it really took me ‘till
now before I could bring myself to REALLY talk about
it with ‘anyone. But I think our friendship is back on

track, which is cool, and it leaves me feeling a little

more open to talk. There isn’t one little thing that you
can point to about him quitting. It’s just that we were
working way too hard; recording an insane amount,
touring, handling all of our merchandise, booking, you
name it, and I think it was blowing everyone’s mind.
Andy and I are such easy going people in so many
ways, but when it comes to our music, we’re both pret-
ty vicious. So, you add up everything else I just men-
tioned and it was only going to take one bad experience
to drive us all apart. Eventually that bad experience hap-
pened, and problems came up between all of us. I can’t
blame him really.

“We might have been able to work things out, but I
guess everyone was too drained to try. ‘I know I was. I
couldn’t wait for that tour to just be over. It’s just like,
the worst thing you can ever do in a band is get too seri-
ous and spend too much time together. After he quit, so
many people told me that we were killing ourselves, and
that no one could even believe that we were still togeth-
er. I guess when you’re involved in it, you can’t see it. I
wish someone would’ve told me that sooner!”

Andy’s on-stage antics and showmanship will be
missed by the fans as well; but just as Anti-Flag has per-
severed, so has Andy. Be sure to check out his new band
Disco Crisis! He played a tremendous part in Anti-
Flag’s current success, so what does the future hold with
out him? After taking a sip of frothy, Justin said, “Well,
I think it looks good and bad. I mean Andy is the best
bass player I’ll ever play with; I’m sure of that. He’s just
incredible! He’s as big a part of Anti-Flag as anyone in
this whole world. So, on all those fronts, it’s bad. But on
the other hand, we’ve been playing with some other
super cool kids and it’s been a lot of fun. We have a new
easy going attitude that Pat and I decided had to happen
if we were to survive at doing this. So, there’s good and
bad. Maybe we’ll all get it back together some day, but
right now, I think everything’s at a good place.

“I think you just have to decide from the very
beginning that this is what you want to do and then go
do it no matter what it takes. It helps, I think, not to want
to be some super rock star or some bullshit like that,
because then you’re doing it just because you want to,
and that’s really important. Otherwise, it just becomes a
drag. It’s funny I say that in a way, because afterlour last
tour [summer of ‘96] I thought .I’d play and tour a lot
less, but then I got back to Pittsburgh and realized I had
nothing left here. That probably helps a lot too, to be a
loser who has nothing else in his life.”

Anti-Flag is kicking this rusted steel town’s ass,
they’re bigger winners than the Steelers! They’ll depart

“Unspoken For Time”

Written by Jeff Barker

Directed by Karla Rosenthal
Presented by Saltworks Theatre Co.

Ten-year—old Diane (Ashley Wells) was
left alone, swinging from a tree while her
parents were baling hay, when a neighbor-
hood punk, Blaine (Gregory Kostal) raped
her. Scared and confused, Diane suppressed
the abuse by never telling anyone. Now, as
a maturing college student, Diane faces the
hidden anxiety that plagued her childhood.

Diane’s story is not an isolated occur-
rence that was created overnight, but a
reﬂection of incidents surrounding every
community. Playwright Jeff Barker doesn’t
forget this, and has included monologues
ﬁom various female characters relating their
own rape experiences. Some stories are
incestuous attacks, others are about young
adults who were unable to ﬁght back. Each
had a way of blaming herself for the crime
against her. The prevailing message is that
each person must ﬁnd it in herself to go on
with life. Something dies inside of a person
when innocence is taken so violently. Diane
can’t erase what happened to her; instead,
she must ﬁnd a way to heal.

The set design carries out the theme of
wounds unhealed with its huge gauze strips

 

draped around the stage. Diane’s life carries
on amidst this pain until she she takes the
initiative to acknowledge the pain that has
enveloped her. Pitt freshman Ashley Wells
portrayed Diane with a convincing realism
beﬁtting the serious theme of the play.
Although Diane’s family is straight

ﬁom the Christian farms of the Midwest, I

the town’s backward thinking is not exclu-
sive to small communities. According to
Pittsburgh’s St. Francis Medical Center, 70
to 80 percent of sexual abusers are family
members, neighbors, or trusted adults in a
child’s environment, with the average age of
victims ranging from eight to 11 years old.

This interpretation of a victim’s story
penetrates the shield communities seem to
put up when they don’t want to deal with the
issue. Barker offers insight into a victim’s
world that has been avoided in popular cul-
ture. Rape is an uncomfortable subject, but
in this case the story is presented in a way
that can be appreciated by anyone, not only
the victims.

Everyone Says I Love You
Directed by Woody Allen
Julia Roberts, Tun Roth, Alan Alda

The only genius left in cinema,
Woody Allen, has done it again. His latest
ﬁlm Everyone Says I Love You possesses
everything a true Woody Allen comedy
should: wit, reality, and biting sarcasm.

Allen has taken a great risk by struc-
turing his ﬁlm as a musical. A lesser direc-
tor probably would have failed in this, but
Allen takes comedy to new levels in his
use of this technique while simultaneous-
ly poking fun at the campiness of all musi-
cals.

The ﬁlm is basically about all the pas-
sion and perils of falling in love. Between
New York, Paris, and Venice, everyone
from aging grandparents, ex-wives, and
young twenty—somethings show the naked

 
   

truth about love, which is that people will
do almost anything to have it.

Surprisingly, just about everyone can
sing. And if they can’t, it’s too damn funny
to notice. Even Julia Roberts and Drew
Barrymore prove that they can actually do
something on screen other than playing
beautiful, empty-headed ingenues. If for
nothing else, see this movie for Tim Roth.
He plays a sociopath in love with Drew
Barrymore who tries in vain to prove that
love can conquer all. Can you imagine the
comic possibilities here?

Perhaps the only small problem with
the ﬁlm is the ending. You’re kind of
expecting an answer, but all you really get
are more confusing questions about love.
But I suppose if Woody Allen doesn’t
have answers to the questions of the heart,
then no one does.

THE PITT NEWS

The Heiress
directed by Larry John Meyers
Playhouse Theatre Company

The Point Park College Theatre
Department, the Playhouse Theatre
Company, and all those Craft Ave. play-
house people usually know how to pro-
duce quality theatre. The subject of
quality can be summarily debated, I
suppose, but with the reputation of such
recent solidi productions as “Lost in
Yonkers,” “The Importance of Being
Earnest,” and “Who’s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf,” it is safe to say that the
Point Park people know what they are
doing. The Playhouse Theatre
Company (Oakland’s own uppity, equi-
ty company) is now performing a pro-
duction of “The Heiress,” Ruth and
Augustus Goetz’s play based on that
quirky Henry James’ novel,
“Washington Square.”

“The Heiress” played on Broadway
last winter to much critical acclaim,
showcasing a damn, damn good Cherry
Jones in the lead role of timid Catherine
Sloper. Catherine is being played by
undergraduate Point Parker Marie
Elana O’Brien, while the majority of
other roles are being played by sea-
soned equity (not necessarily uppity)

actors.

The story of “The Heiress” is about

as blase as the story of American the-
atre itself, being set in 19th century
Washington Square and dealing with
Victorian things and mean old fathers
and timid women. Unlike many
American plays written in the Victorian
tradition, this play is about a woman
and is also about her strength. I don’t
like to muddle too deeply into the polit-
ical relevance of producing a play that
showcases the strength of women in the
midst of 19th century Western culture,
but I think the message is well timed
considering the feminine awareness the
Western world is gaining in recent
times. Regardless of all the contextual,
intellectual, and political bullshit that
must surround the making of theatre, I
am expecting a damn good show.
The Heiress is running from Jan. 22
thru Feb. 9, Wed. thru Sat. at 8 p.m.
with Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. at the
Playhouse of Point Park College, 222
Craft Avenue. Tickets are $18 for Fri.
and Sat. and $16 for all other perfor-
mances. Student rush tickets (half-
price) are available beginning a half-
hour before perfomzance.

Marvin ’s Room

Directed by Jerry Zaks -

Starring Meryl Streep, Leonardo
DiCaprio, and Diane Keaton '

Marvin’s Room is a. movie
adaptation of a stage play by Scott
McPherson. It is the first movie Jerry
Saks has directed.

The movie is about two sisters

who have not seen each other in twenty
years. Bessie (Diane Keaton) is taking
care of their bedridden father (Hume
Cronyn) and his aging sister Ruth
(Gwen Verdon) at the family home in
Florida.

The other sister Lee (Meryl
Streep) moved to Ohio. She has two
sons. Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a
very troubled teenager. He is in an men-
tal institution for burning their house
down. Charlie (Hal Scardino) is the
token little boy intellectual.

When Dr. Willy (Robert De
Niro) tells Bessie she needs a bone mar-
row transplant she calls her sister for
help. Lee takes the boys to Florida to be
tested for a match.

Bob, the receptionist, (Dan
Hedaya) is one of the funniest charac-
ters next to Aunt Ruth. Bob after look-
ing at Hank’s medical card says he
noticed Hank was on Lithium. Bob
says, “Lithium, it’s a great drug isn’t it.”

Lee comes off as a white trash
beautician. She is very blunt and says,

“We call it the loony bin, or the nut-

 

house, to show we’ve got a sense of
humor about it.”

The whole movie is about tak-
ing serious things and making them
funny. When I mean funny I don’t mean
Eddie Murphy funny. It’s little things
like Aunt Ruth, who had an mechanism
attached to her body to help her live,
being able to open the garage door with
the box..

The serious side of the movie
comes out in little bits and pieces. It
tells the story of the two sisters. Lee
wants to be a beautician and doesn’t pay
attention to her son’s. Bessie helps her
sister to see that there is more to love
than just receiving.

The movie is called Marvin’s
Room not because Marvin ever talks in
the movie but that the characters are
changed by the events in his room. It is
about being happy, forgiving and mak-
ing amends.

It was an enjoyable movie and I
mean I wasn’t looking at my watch to
see when the movie was going to end. It
is worth seeing just to see Aunt Ruth.
Verdon gave a great performance.
Hedaya, even though his part was small,
was really funny.

It is definitely a chick ﬂick but I
think there is enough in there to make it
entertaining for the guys too.

ROCK.

Their music is full of rage and a refusal
to give in to complacency, and of course
their lyrics are ﬁlled with the usual political
punk rock fare. Sometimes this stuff borders
on being predictable rhetoric, but at the
same time, I’ve been singing the chorus to
“Die For the Government” to myself all
week. It’s infectious. These are smart kids,
well aware of the art they are creating and
the tradition of the creation of this proletari-

the available pool of inﬂuence, and I for one
was surprised to hear the sounds of such

I Organization is the key

Organization: we definitely need it. You probably

   

need it too. Yesterday, the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette ran '

an article on the" Really Organized, people who have
their lives under control and manageable. We think this
is a really great concept and would like to jump on the
bandwagon. It would be great if you would too.

You are probably thinking, “You guys up there at The
Pitt News may be a bunch of disorganized slobs, but I’ve
got my act together.” This may very well be true, and if
it is, God bless you. You might even find it in your hearts
to send letters telling us how to get our act together just
like you. —

However, most of.the planet is as much as a chaotic
mess as we are. We try. We honestly do, but it is so hard
to stick with it. Let’s face it: staying organized can be a
dull, repetitive task, but it makes life so much easier.

You may now be asking yourself, “Why in the heck‘

do they care if I am organized? They should just worry
about themselves.” But you see, we are worrying about
ourselves. The more organized you are, the more effi-
cient you are. In your extra time, you could send us let-
ters for publication or go out and do something news-
worthy so that we can write a story about it. If by any
chance we need to deal directly with you, then the more
organized you are, the easier it makes our job.

Also, think about how much more pleasant the world
would be if everyone were organized. Traffic jams would
be a thing of the past because everyone would have
planned their traveling times accordingly instead of wait-
ing until the last minute. We’d all probably live longer if
we were more organized. We’re ‘not just talking about not

having to worry about suffocating under that large pile of -

clothes you’ve been meaning to wash but just can’t seem
to find the time. What we mean is, think of how much
less stressful life would be if everything were well
thought out and planned in advance. Wouldn’t that be
swell?

Sure, even the best—laid plans can go astray, but how
often do the worst-laid plans succeed? Organization is
the key.

Aortion is a legal for

Tlus Wednesday marked the
24th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade,
the Supreme Court decision that
made abortion a legal procedure in
this country. For longer than I’ve
been alive, it’s been not only legal
but also socially acceptable to kill
human beings just because they
have not yet had the fortune to be

. born. The more I think about this,

the more I realize that many people
in this country do not respect human

» life in general. I’m not just talking

about respect for the lives of the

unborn, as in abortion, but also a i

more widespread lack of respect for
life.

Abortion is a legal form of
murder that many people disagree
with. There are, however, other
fonns of legal murder that do not all
receive the attention abortion does.

Capital punishment is one
example. Although occasional
opposition occurs in areas when an
execution is carried out, capital pun-
ishment is not generally disputed by
large numbers of people. There is a
feeling that the criminal has com-
rrritted a heinous crime, and death is
a ﬁtting consequence. This may or
may not be true, but while I’m not
suggesting that these criminals be
allowed to freely roam the streets,_I
also do not believe that we should
kill them.

To paraphrase something I’ve
heard before, the question is not
whether or not the criminal deserves
to die, but whether or not we have
the right to kill them. (I’d like to
share the source of that idea, but I
can’t remember where I originally
heard it.) It completely expresses
the way capital punishment should
be viewed. It is entirely possible that

-5::

a crime so great has been commit-
ted that the offender does not
deserve to remain alive. That, how-
ever, is not a decision that we as
human beings are qualiﬁed to
make. ' I

Another violation of the human
right to life is gaining momentum
The legality of assisted suicide is
currently? being questioned. To
begin with, comrrritting suicide is
not a moral action. Killing oneselfis
throwing away the best gift that one
could ever receive ——- life. “Suicide”
is deﬁned in Webster’s Dictionary
as “to put (oneself) to death: kill.”
Viewed in this light, suicide itself is
a legal form of murder. When laws
making attempted suicide a crime
were repealed, the idea was not to
make suicide easier or to convey the
idea that it is an acceptable wayito
handle problems. Instead, it was
meant to help those who had
attempted suicide and had notdied.
Rather than keeping quiet out of
fear, these people could seek the
help that they need.

By involving another person in
a suicide, that person is assisting in
the act of putting another human
being to death. The assistant is
guilty of deliberately killing the
other person, regardless of whether
or not the other person wanted to
die. To refer once more to Webster’s
Dictionary, “murder,” when used as
a synonym for “kill,” speciﬁcally
implies “premeditation and there-
fore full moral responsibility.”
Premeditation defnritely applies to
those who assist in suicides, mean-
ing that they shoulder at least as
much responsibility in the killing as
the victim. That being the case, any-
one assisting in a suicide has really
committed murder.

This now brings me back to my

m of murder

original concern, abortion. This is

one area where there shouldn’t even .

be any question of whether or not
there is a justiﬁable reason to kill.
The baby has not committed any
crime against society. It isn’t sick, in
pain, and about to die. It hasn’t lost
the will to live. In fact, it has its
whole life ahead of it with a practi-
cally unlimited number of options.
Any women having the misfor-
tune of an unwanted pregnancy
need to take responsibility for the
consequences of her actions, and
not kill an innocent child because
she simply didn’t think ahead. The
only instance in which this wouldn’t
apply would be cases of rape. This
doesn’t mean that rape victims
should be able to have abortions.
Instead, it indicates that the victim
has suffered a honible experience
and as a result has been given
responsibility another human life

' for at least nine months.
Whether or not she wants to be a

responsible for this other human
life, sheis.

It isn’t right that she kill the
child because she isn’t able to cope
with the fact that it exists. This may
seem like a cold attitude, and easy
for someone who has never been
raped to say. Unfortunately, I have a
ﬁiend who has experienced sexual
assault, so I have some idea of the
emotional havoc suffered by the
victim and her family. My ﬁiend
didn’t become pregnant from her
experience, for which I’m extreme-
ly grateful, but if she had, even see-
ing what she and her family where
going through, I could never sup-
port a decision to abort a child.

If a pregnant rape victim does
have an abortion, it still won’t rid
her of the memories of the actual

Cinderella goes to the ball
and sees the VP cut a rug

 

Cinderella goes to the ball. At least
that’s how it felt as I ran around D.C. to get
a gown for an inaugural ball. Excitement
rushed through me as I pondered what
political bigwigs, celebrities, and assorted
interesting characters would be there.

What do you see when you picture an
inaugural ball? Debonair gentlemen in
crisp tuxedos? Elegant ladies in ballgowns
ﬁt for Princess Di? People dancing with

. the style of Fred and Ginger? Poise and

grace? -

Think again.

Imagine my chagrin at having spent a
small fortune (at least to an impoverished
student like myself) to attend what was in
effect a pretty lame prom for overindul—
gent, middle-aged has-beens and never-
will-bes, the disap-
pointment to walk
in the door and be
told I had just
missed the presi-
dent. Sorry
Cinderella, I guess

and tacky clothing. I should have guessed
this when I arrived and was told that my
friends and I had just missed the president.
We immediately began asking about other
people we hoped would be stopping by the
ball. The gentleman at the door told us he
didn’t know, but the look on his face said
“poor fools.”

How bad were these people? Well, to
give you a hint, when a fellow Pitt News
adventurer and I were looking down upon
the crowd from the ﬂoor above, I felt the
need to remark about one of the men danc-
ing that he looked like he was having a
seizure standing up. There was a man in a
tuxedo and a baseball hat. This may have
seemed kind of cool and quirky if it were
someone either really young or really old.
He was neither. There were the three 20-
something females who couldn’t even clap
together although they seemed to think
: they were a white ver-

interesting, we made up
agameaswesatonthe
 risers which were avail-
 able for press. The game

you’re just an ugly  consisted of looking into
stepsister.  the crowd to find people
Let’s set the  who in some way,

scene. The inau-
gural ball that I
attended took place
in the National
Building Museum
(at least in the Air
and Space Museum Ball there would have
been cool exhibits to look at.) It occurred
in an extremely large room with colurrms
that possibly rival those of the Parthenon.
The setting was ﬁne. It had the proper
stateliness.

The music was  well, let’s just say it
was not what I expected. I had wonied that
Michael Bolton might be performing at the
ball (he was listed as one of the people who
was performing at one of the 13 balls).
Fortunately, he wasn’t. Neither were any
of the other acts from the list that I had
seen. No, the music was the Isley Brothers
and The Coasters. The whats? The ﬂat-
round-pieces-of-cork-that-you’re-sup-
posed-to—put-glasses-on-rather-than-mark-
the-fumiture? As Dick Clark would say,
this will be a rockin’ eve. Yeah right.

Now, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.
What about the people in attendance? First
of all, remember that the ball is open to any
schmuck with $150.00 for a ticket and a
choice spot on the waiting list. I didn’t real-
ize this until I was already at the ball. (My
ticket, by the way, was free. If I’d paid for
the ticket, I’d be too embanassed to tell
you what it was really like.) So, instead of
ﬁnding cool celebrities, whether they be
political, journalistic, or entertaining, one
finds a room full of waimabes with big hair

 shape, or form resem-
 bled a celebrity. We then
 pretended that that per-
 son was the celebrity we
thought they resembled,
’ even though the resem-
blances were not striking in the least. But
hey, you’ve got to make do with what
you’ve got to work with. At least in my
mind, B.B. King and James Earl Jones
were kinda there. The guy in the baseball
cap could have been Steven Spielberg (the
only resemblance was the cap).

Another rip-off at the ball is the fact

that although the tickets cost $l50.00,i
there is no open bar or hors d’oeuvres. In;
fact, it cost $2.00 for a glass of Coke which "
contained less than a can. Beer was $4.00,
a bottle, and God only knows how much:
wine and mixed drinks were going for?
Needless to say, I only had one Coke, and,
it pained me to know how much it had cost ”

as I drank it slowly to savor every last drop.

The highlight of the ball was seeing a;
rather inebriated Al and Tipper Gore cut a}
rug in their spastic, we-know-we-can’t—'.

dance-so-we’l1-have-fun-looking-silly

style. Seeing them have a good time made;
me realize that it was all in the way you;
looked at it. Though the ball may not have‘

been all it was cracked up to be, I must say
I had a good time hanging out with my Pitt

News compatriots. Perhaps the ugly step-A

sister really was Cinderella.‘

Jennifer Sinfelt has returned ﬁvm the ball
and must admit that those glass slippers
really made her feet hurt.

Thursday, January 23, I997

 

Taking that step onto Bill Clinton’s
bridge to the next century will not be a step
many take in confidence. Why? Because
of the images of impending disaster it fore-
casts to millions of Americans. However,
what lies on the other side is, if nothing
else, a better United States. In his inaugur-
al speech, Clinton spoke of safer streets,
improved education, and reformed politics:
iron beams on which we would like to
believe our nation can rely to support the
weight of its citizemy. And they can. But
the engineers of disaster, the Paula Joneses,
special prosecutors, and all their gloomy
cronies, stand with their arms crossed hap-
pily waiting to witness the carnage of a col-
lapse. They revel in the look of constema-
tion they see on the faces of those about to
cross.

And so we stop and think twice before
taking that ﬁrst step. But that bridge is
stronger than we may think, and we have
ourselves as citizens to believe in as much
as the president.

Clinton’s inaugural speech struck at
the heart of our nation’s problems: “We
need a new government for a new century,
a government humble enough not to try to
solve all our problems for us, but strong
enough to give us the tools to solve our
problems for ourselves.” Clinton strongly
stressed the importance of personal respon-

THE PITT NEWS

Look to yourself forlhe power of change

sibility and the need to develop that respon-
sibility.

When we stop trusting the panacea of
“social reform” and “social solutions,” we
can begin to look to ourselves for the
power of change. Americans are largely
honest, hard-working individuals. Too eas-
ily are we distracted and disturbed by the
negative images sometimes portrayed in
the media; Because what the media looks
to report is the unusual, the break from the
norm, what we get is a distorted image of
ourselves created by highlighting the worst
and most unusual. We grope too quickly
for a solution, for that ugly image and all
too often seek the answers in a too sirnplis—
tic don’t-ask-me—to—help—I—already—pay-
taxes solution. That just doesn’t work.

We must seize the opportunity to take
responsibility. Standing in the midst of sev-
eral hundred thousand people on Monday,
I glanced around the crowd huddled in the
Mall standing area. What I saw. had
Herculean impact, accented by the presi-
dent’s words in the background. The faces
around me — black, white, tan, yellow,
Democrat, Republican, male, and female
— all were uniﬁed in one goal: hope for the
future.

So why don’t we assume that respon-
sibility? It begins when we choose to act,
not when some law is passed in the depths
of Congress or a treaty signed in some

_ room buried in the White House. We can

make hope happen and get rid of the hype.

It’s time to stop sloughing off the prob-
lerns that we try to solve with some societal
answer. There are many who, because of
their personal responsibility, overcame
defective educational systems, rose above
mediocrity, and lived the American dream.
They chose not to sit around blaming oth-
ers, they acted. Looking at this example, it
is hard to believe that the government has
waited this long to emphasize such a basic
and crucial concept.

We need the tools to build our own
futures, not a promise that there will some
future waiting for us when we get there.
We must look to ourselves to stop expect-
ing and complaining, and get up to work
for ourselves. As a young nation among the
global community, we have grown to be
what we are because, in the past, we acted.
Our immigrant ancestors came to this
nation seeking success, not Social Security,
and they were willing to work hard for it.
The illustrious ‘80s have lulled us into a
dangerously spoiled state, but the party is
over and it is time for us to get back to
work

I saw that potential on those faces in
the crowd. Some desperate, some stoic,
others smiling, but all of them hoping for
the best as they prepared to take that ﬁrst
step towards the future. I know that I’m

going.

Marc Nuzzo feels that responsibility is
hope, not hype.

worth sacriﬁcing a human life?

At the end of last year, two.teens from
Philadelphia killed their newborn baby, and
people everywhere became outraged after
hearing about the incident. Suggestions
from the public on how to punish the teens
ranged from forced sterilization to the death
penalty for both the mother and the father.
If the mother had decided a few weeks ear-
lier that she did not want the child, she
could have had it killed, and it would have
been considered legally her right, her
choice.

Pro-life is a positive term that people
are often willing to apply to themselves
without thinking of the complete meaning
implied by the expression. To refer a ﬁnal
time to Webster’s Dictionary, pro-life is a
word used to describe one who opposes
abortion. While this is certainly true, pro-
life has a much broader use. It’s used by
many pro-lifers, including the National
Right to Life, to describe those who place
emphasis on preventing the elimination of
any human life, not only the lives of the
unborn. Anyone who is truly pro-life would
not only treasure all forms of human life,
but would also do everything possible to
protect it.
