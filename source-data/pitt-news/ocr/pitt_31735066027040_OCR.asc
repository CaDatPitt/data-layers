PIH‘ dance

By Scott Emmert

Fagulty Assembly has suffered its first
casualty related to Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s decision to drop HealthAmerica
from Pitt’s medical insurance coverage —
contrary to the advice of both Faculty
Assembly and Senate Council.

“This is not the best of times in my opin-
ion,” Faculty Assembly President James
Holland said at yesterday’s meeting. “I am
sad to report that Professor Richard Tobias
has resigned from all Senate activities.”

Tobias held posts on the Senate Executive
Committee, as co-chair of the Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee, as pro tem-
pore member and secretary of the Senate
Anti-Discrimination Policies Committee, as

executive committee liaison to the
Commonwealth Relations Committee and as
executive committee liaison to the Senate
Library Committee.

“I certainly understand Tobias doing this,”
Holland said. “There is no one in my memo-
ry in the history of the senate who has more
diligently, and industriously, and selﬂessly
worked for the university and through the
Senate. -

“On one hand I'm sad that he's doing it,”
Holland said. “On the other hand, I well
understand it in view of the biggest, most
recent, most blatant undercutting of the sen-
ate opinion being the decision announced
contrary to senate votes, and without
detailed discussion for any reason not to fol-
low the opinion and decision made on health

Nursing Association keeps busy

By David Palmer
Staff Writer

March proved to be a busy
month for the Nursing Student
Association.

In addition to electing new
officers for the fall term, the
NSA has been successful in
changing the nursing uniforms.

“There were a lot of com-
plaints about the old uniforms, so
with the help of the Dean of
Nursing Ellen Rudy, we will be
wearing new, more comfortable
uniforms beginning in the fall,”
said Ed Nosky, the newly elected
president of NSA.

The vote for the uniforms
replacement was 177 to four in
favor of replacing the old uni-
fonns.

N SA held their annual Nursing
Week which ran from March 20-
24. The activities included a
nursing faculty and staff appreci-
ation day, movies, a Hollywood
Squares-type game that featured
faculty dressed as celebrities, a
mixer at Hemingway’s and the
Nursing Horizon Conference ——
an event that provides work-
shops and lectures on the nursing
profession. -

Dr. Lynette Jack gave a lecture
on stress management tech-
niques on the last day of the
event.

“We tried to make Nursing
Week better this year by provid-
ing more than just lectures, and
we had a much better turnout
than in the past,” said Nosky,

NSA’s main goal is to get its

nursing students active in local,
state and national issues in nurs-
ing, according to Nosky, .

NSA members participated in
a march on Washington last
weekend to protest the high
patient—to-nurse ratios that are
becoming more and more com-
mon and the use of unlicensed

practitioners in order to save_

money.
Members of NSA are also
planning to attend the 43rd
Annual National Student
Nursing Association Convention
in Charlotte, N.C. This national
convention will be held from
April 5-9 and will provide lec-
tures and workshops geared for
nursing students.

A local non-proﬁt corporation
is joining together this weekend
with Pitt students to host the
first ever university-wide dance
marathon.

“We are a home away from
home for people who are being
treated for life-threatening ill-
ness,” said Pat Siger, executive
director of Family House, Inc.

She said Family House, Inc.
hosts patients from all over the
world in three facilities located
in Oakland. VV1th a total of I27
rooms, adult patients who are
undergoing treatment at hospi-
tals managed by or affiliated
with the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center and
their families can lessen the
emotional and financial strain
of treatment by staying at a
Family House. ‘

There are two Family
‘Houses, one on North Neville
Streetand one on McKee Place.
There is also a Family House
Inn at the corner of Forbes
Avenue at McKee Place.

“Family House has hosted
18,000 families in the last 11
years,” said Siger. “It is $20 to
$25 dollars a night.”

Family House offers services
such as private bathrooms, linen
service, shuttles to hospitals-
provided by Presbyterian and
Montefiore, TV lounges,
kitchens, dining areas and living
rooms.

“The houses are decorated
really beautifully,” said
Anderson, the special events
coordinator of Family House.
“Fifty-nine percent of the peo-
ple staying there are patients,
the rest are family members.”

She said Family House is run
by a voluntary board of direc-
tors, and receives wide support
from the community.

“We have a very small paid
staff, with 225 full—time volun-
teers,” said Siger.

“Family House has a wonder-
ful reputation in this city,” said
Anderson.

She said it decided to get ,

involved in this year’s ‘dance
‘marathon because of all the
help it receives from Pitt stu-
dents.

“We have so many students
that do so much,” she said. “We

The WHO also announced

.In light of the cutbacks occurring in UPMC, NSA has realized that it may have

to refocus its aims.

“We had a career day, but it was cancelled. We need to work on more creative
ways to market ourselves because there are a surplus of nurses in this area,” said

Michelle DeHaven, the legislative coordinator for NSA.

NSA, Nosky said, believes the patient-nurse ratio should be about 8:1 respec-
tively on the normal rounds. In intensive care units, it said, the ratio should be one

or two patients for each nurse to care for.

Nosky also said these high ratios only allow nurses to perform very basic tasks

In order to get through this

rest of your life, you need to
learn effective coping skills.

Diet and exercise play a
major role in wellness and
stress response. A healthy
diet can really make a differ-

react to stress. Caffeine,
alcohol and sugary snacks

Exercise is a proven stress

insurance.” y

Holland was referring to
O’Connor’s decision last week
to grant sole provider status to
Blue Cross for Pitt’s faculty
and staff medical insurance
needs.

In weeks leading up to this
decision, support for maintain-
ing HealthAmerica as an
active carrier along with Blue
Cross was reflected in over-
whelming votes by Faculty
Assembly and Senate Council
to do so.

Holland indicated that
although he was unsure of the
exact motive behind Tobias’
resignation, he said Tobias
“might well consider this
move as his final support for
the senate given the incredible
disregard for the senate that
we recently had and a rather
persistent disregard over the
past four years.”

As it stands, the decision’

over health insurance is a done

ning sole providership on July
1. But still there is persistence
among some faculty members

' to retain HealthAmerica. 0

Herbert Barry, chair of the"
Commonwealth Relations
Committee, addressed the
assembly with a proposed res-
olution to retain
HealthAmerica for faculty and
staff who arecurrently under
their coverage.

This step, according to
Holland, would constitute one
of the options which Faculty
Assembly had already consid-
ered and ruled out before
O’Connor’s decision. With
this option, HealthAmerica
would be allowed to exist at
Pitt but gain no new enroll-
ments.

“It’s better than having no
HealthAmerica at all,” Barry
said. _ I A

“I am in HealthAmerica and
I hate giving it up,” Holland
said. “But I’m neutral with

respect to the motion.” ‘

The motion was tabled and

held over for next week’s _

Senate Council meeting.

United Faculty President ‘

Mark Ginsburg distributed a
document urging faculty mem-
bers to join United Faculty in
a drive toward possible union-
ization. V

In this document, United
Faculty condemns the Pitt
administration’s “arrogant use
of power” in the recent health
insurance issue and asserts
that unionization and collec-
tive bargaining is the only
viable option to prevent fur-
ther such instances.

United Faculty plansto
begin debate on the issue in _
September, leading to an elec-
tion in which faculty can
decide whether or not to
change its relationship with
administration.

Who ' ll stop the rum .
Well, yesterday we had all'four seasons. It started in the
morning with something that could reasonably be called sum-
mer, and fluctuated between a balmy spring, warm. winter and
cold fall. No one was quite sure what to make of it — do we
grab the winter jacket, raincoat or just go in shorts and shirt
sleeves? A
There is only one question we want, to ask Mother Nature:
why? What most grievous crime was committed that we must
endure this seesawing and toying with our emotions? How are
we to cope when we don’t know if we are in the next ice age, or
facing global warming? Are we supposed to join SEAC or the
Polar Bear Club? Where does it all end?
There are many philosophical questions‘ which these weather

changes pose for us. While wardrobes are one part of this .

whole indecision, the mounting factors soon become over-
whelming for students, especially those facing finals. Are we
supposed to suffer from the light deprivation-induced depres-
sion? Or do we look forward to the weather changes with vari-
ety as the spice of life.

With the books we all have to carry, there is no room or time
to change into all the various weather gear. How are we to cope
with all the possibilities? Can we go skiing, or is it. sun bathing
and frisbee on the Cathedral Lawn. _

What can the people of Pittsburgh do to end this malignment
from nature? Only the Classics department can manage the sto-
icism necessary to endure the freakish weather without com-
plaint. Since the major budget cuts all across the board have
reduced funds for education, it is unlikely we can convince the
administration of the University of Pittsburgh to relocate the
campus farther south, although there are often small Caribbean
islands up for sale.

A small Caribbean island might be just what Pitt needs. We
wouldn’t necessarily be cramped for space. In fact, we could
leave the stadium and the football program on the mainland,
since if they don’t play in the snow and the cold, the players
just aren’t as tough. Also, we could put the swim team to better
use than just doing laps. They could train while carrying cam-
pus mail in waterproof sacks around the island.

Unfortunately, this is only a dream. What may not be a
dream, however, is appeasing whatever divinity that Pittsburgh
may have offended. It is unfair for all the out of state students,
and even the in state ones who aren’t from Pittsburgh, to have
to bearthe burden of these sins. Allthe students will certainly
be willing to take part in restoring better weather to Pittsburgh.

Perhaps the Classic department may have our answer. Instead
of sitting around and re-translating the stuff Benjamin Jowett
prepared for us a long time ago, they can help us devise a suit-
able sacrifice to the weather gods. We can set out a hecatomb to
Mother Nature, or pour out libations to the various divinities.
Go to the 15th floor of the Cathedral and demand that these
people make some practical use of all that knowledge of the
ancient world. Then, maybe, the skies will clear.

Differing viewpoints on photos

t is said that
I “a picture is

worth a thou-
sand words” —
but what if those
words aren’t
worth saying?

 

Columnist ..*:.:.::.‘::;
Rick rounding risqué
NOWliIl photos that the

printer pulled
from an issue of The Pitt News
just hours before publication
brought cries of “censorship”
from a number of my col-
leagues, most notably Jon
Hayes, who wrote a column in
this paper, and Bill Kirchner,
who did the same in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. I’m
probably in the minority, but I
don’t thinkthat the photos,
one of which supposedly con-

tained a nude woman’s body’

being painted and the other,
two women simulating oral
sex, really belonged in this
newspaper.

You see, it’s not really a
matter of censorship or prud-
ishness — we’re simply talk-
ing about responsible journal-
ism. Our responsibility is sim-
ply to report, not to be, the

news, and when any sort of.

media source becomes itself
part of a story, it loses its cred-
ibility.

Perhaps we as college
students think too much of
“now” and don’t consider the
consequences of our actions
until years down the road.
How many people who liked
to get blitzed on the weekends
just for its own sake became
alcoholics in later life because
they didn’t know when to
quit? I also read one survey,

regu‘larly published in this

paper, that 32 percent of col-
lege students had unintended.
sex when they were drunk, and
with the threat of AIDS, how
much of a gamble are they tak-
ing?

Furthermore, what will a
scandal like this do to our pro-
fessional lives? Like many
who write for this paper, I’m

working toward a career in

journalism, but will a rep-
utable media outlet hire some-
one without respect for any
type of standards? Simply put,
would we want to be associat-
ed ‘with something we
wouldn’t want our parents —
or kids — to know about?
Now, the photos in question
were to run with a less-than-
favorable review of a Jonathan
Blank documentary called Sex,
Drugs and Democracy, which
played at the Rex Theater that
weekend (as well as this past
weekend). Set in the
Netherlands, the movie tried to
give some possible insights
into why the Dutch have a
lower teen pregnancy rate and

fewer cases of AIDS than the-

United States while being less
inhibited sexually. However,
since the review was indeed
critical, I don’t see what good
the photos were, as they would
have taken away from the
review’s primary premise -
that the flick didn’t really
answer any questions. In this
context, their presence made
about as much sense as right-
wing preacher Jerry Falwell, in
one of his “Old-Time Gospel
Hour” shows, actually display-
ing some pornography aspart
of an “anti-porn” crusade last
year. I haven’t actually seen
the photos, but I do ‘know what
oral sex, body-painting and
other forms of nudity look
like. What’s the use? .

Some will tell you that,
since this paper is geared
toward fairly cosmopolitan
university students, anything is
fair game. That’s not necessar-
ily the case; as should be
assumed from the extent of
local media coverage this fias-
co received, The Pitt News has
a far greater readership than it
realizes. Indeed, I myself take
about 25 copies of the paper to
work when it runs one of my
columns, not to mention
friends in Cleveland; Chicago;
and Wichita, Kan., who regu-
larly read what I write.

And what about advertisers?
Since The Pitt News is a publi-
cation independent of the uni-

versity (with apologies to the
Phoenix, whose staff is proba-
bly licking its chops) and
depends on advertising to meet
its budget, suppose that certain
businesses no longer choose to
advertise with us as a result of
running those pics? At this
point, there IS no paper. They
may say to us, “Print what you
want, but we won’t pay for it.”

We in the media have
tremendous power in inform-
ing others unfettered by gov-
ernment; however, with that
power comes a responsibility
act justly. As the old cliché
goes, your freedom of
speech does not give you the
right to yell “Fire!” in a
crowded theater. Similarly, if
we consider to take unneces-
sary chances in figuring out
what we cover and how to do
it, not only do we lose our
audience, but we also give our
critics the ammunition they
need to promote-the censor-

ship that we say we hate.’

Freedom is never absolute —
without the limits that society
places upon us, we would see
total anarchy.

During one of my commen-
taries for WORD-FM, I criti-
cized James Dobson of “Focus
on the Family,” and Mark, the
show’s host, let me know I
erred in doing so. While I do
have some real disagreements
with Dr. Dobson, attacking
him would have left me with-
out a‘ forum, as most of that
audience takes him very seri-
ously. In the same way, The
Pitt News would best serve its
readers by giving it to them
straight and not titillating them
as they would have a few
weeks ago. In that way, we
avoid lowering ourselves to
the level of the “scandal
sheet.” What we print says
something about us. As the
apostle Paul put it,
“Everything is permissible —
but not everything is benefi-
cial.” .

mentator for WORD-FM.

Peterson '5

NBA stock
rises of All-
Star game

Columnist .

Brett .°1‘eV"

Fondrk 1‘ ' °‘
11 o t ,

there may be a
Pitt basketball player from last
year’s team headed to the
NBA.

Spindly center Jaime
Peterson, all 200 pounds of
him, is quietly doing his
darnedest to become a late-
round draft pick.

In the National Association
of Basketball College All-Star
game in Seattle on Sunday,
Peterson scored 12 points,
shooting six of seven from the
ﬁeld while pulling down eight
rebounds against some of the
best competition in the nation.

Not bad for a guy who was a
non-factor before last season.

In 1993 he seemed destined
to be a bench player. Playing
behind Eric Mobley, he
received limited minutes and
averaged a paltry five points
and three rebounds a game. ‘

But thrusted into the starting
lineup as Pitt’s only center last
year, Peterson stepped to the
forefront and shined in Ralph
Willard’s frantic run-and-gun
style of play.

His play improved dramati-

cally as he raised his produc-
tion to 14 points and nine
rebounds a game.

He was named second team
All-Big East.

He was one of the most
improved players in the coun-
try.

But how good is he? .

Good enough for the NBA?

What is “good” to NBA
scouts?

To make it to “the league” as
college players call it, ‘a guy
must have the whole package,
mentally and physically.

A So let’s take a look at what
Peterson brings to the table:

+ A productive senior season
on a team that had a bad year
(clearly the Panthers’ quiet

- leader).

+ An excellent work ethic
(who knew that he could be an
impact player?).

+ A strong showing in post-
season all—star games (a defi-
nite surprise).

+ Top physical condition
(especially endurance).

+ Runs the floor as well as
any big man (graceful as a
gazelle).

Now let’s look at his limita-
trons:

- His weight (at 6’9”, 200
pounds, he’s about 50 pounds
short).

- He will have to move to
power forward (it’s hard to
imagine him matching up with
Karl Malone in the post).

Relay teamsspark men's, women's track

By Diavail Smith
Staﬂ Writer

The men’s and women’s track
teams battled on two fronts as
several Panthers ran at the
Colonial Relays at the College
of William and Mary in Virginia
and at the Gatorade Classic at
the University of Miami.

“Miami had the tougher com-
petition,” coach Steve Lewis
said. “The more powerful teams
were at Miami.”

The Gatorade Classic includ-
ed some familiar faces from the
Big East such as Villanova,
Miami, St. John’s and Syracuse,
but the field didn’t bother the
Panthers.

Even before the whole team
met in Miami, some team mem-
bers made a stop in Virginia to
do some work.

The tag team of Wes
Alexander, Curtis Anderson, Jay
Murphy and Jay Jones nailed
their winning time of 59.95 in
the shuttle relay to get things
started for the Panthers.

In another tag team event,
Curtis
Anderson, Jerel Williams and
Jay Jones finished second, hit-
ting a time of 1:24 seconds in
the 4x200 relay.

But the relay action didn’t
stop there. In the women’s
4x200, Zenia Ayrton, Joetta
Purter, Shana Fadis and Tonya
Mullins hit a time of 1:37.30
seconds to take second. V

In individual competition,
Wes Alexander took second

I place in the men’s 400—meter

intermediate hurdles, hitting a
time of 52.88 seconds and also
qualifying for the Intercollegiate
Association of Amateur
Athletes of America champi-
onships.

‘And in the women’s 400-
meter intermediate hurdles, the
Panthers took three of the four
top spots in the race, with Angie
Martin taking second.(59.95),
Joetta Purter and Lakeya Smith
finishing in third and fourth
respectively. ‘

“Angie ran her best half-rnile
of the season,” Lewis said.

After that meet, which took
place on Friday, this group went
on to rendezvous with the rest of
the team in Miami.

And once they got there,

fourth-year man Frank Nesko
got things started with a victory
in the 1,500-meter run (3:5l.O8),
hitting his best time this season
to qualify for the IC4As.

“We got a lot of things done,”
Lewis said. “The team ran very
well.”

Second-year man Ed
Adamson did his thing in the
3,000-meter steeplechase, hit-
ting his second"-place time and
also his season’s best of 9:16.53
seconds to also qualify.

And in men’s tag team action,
Jay Murphy, Jay Jones, Wes
Alexander and Curtis Anderson
took second in the 4x400-meter

Men's tennis rebounds
from tough weekend

By Rachel Lenzi
For The Pitt News

Coming off a disappointing
weekend that included two
difficult losses to Villanova
and Georgetown, Pitt men’s
tennis went up against
Edinboro University yesterday
afternoon at the Cost Center.

The team looked to rebound
and improve its record, along
with its confidence level. The
Panthers did just that, winning
over Edinboro and improving
their record to 8-9.

Pitt’s - singles players
stormed out early and kept a
high-tempo, taking all five
singles matches that were
played. Each player dominat-
ed his match, but No.3 seed
Christian Frenza faced a tough
competitor in Edinboro’s
Lorna Amarasinghe. The
match was the longest of the
afternoon, but Frenza came
out on top, taking two straight
sets, 7-6, 6-2. No. 2 seed Brad
Wade won his singles match
also, defeating Dave
Salvatore, 6-3, 6-2.

Sophomore Braden Doherty
had a strong match as well.
He set and controlled the pace
of the match en route to a 6-1,
6-0 singles win over Paul
Skrok, and also in a doubles
win over Skrok and Salvatore.

Doherty, the No. 1 seed, dom-
inated every aspect of the
game, from strong serving to

good speed.

“I was pretty intense on the
court, which helps me focus
on my task and my game

 

plan,” said Doherty.

Pitt’s Mike Sullivan, the No.
4 seed, won an easy match
over Rich Robison and gar-
nered a point for the Panthers.
The victory was a much-need-
ed one for Sullivan, who had
been on. the losing track over

Win over Edinboro
hes record for women

By Jim Wheeler
szaﬁ Writer ‘

The Lady Panthers crushed
Edinboro 6-1 yesterday. “With this
win, they tied the all-time record
for victories for a Pitt women’s
team, which is 12, set in 1975.

No. 2 seed Brad Wade beat Edinboro's Dave Salvatore 6-3, 6-2.

In singles action, Alison Baker,
playing at the No.1 spot, was the

She was defeated by Nikki Clark
6-2, 60.

Fran Davis defeated Jill Hicks

back and fought my hardest and I
pulled it out.”

Tamara Kalesnik demolished
opponent Melanie Vierkom 6-0,
6-0. ’

“I’m really satisﬁed right now
with the way I’m playing,” said
Kalesnik. “I kept my head into it
and closed it out because I really
needed to get back on track.”

Tammy Keister won 6-1, 6-2
and Kristin Siegel defeated Jen
Lindow 6-0, 6-1.

In doubles action, Davis and
Zielinski lost a tough match to
Clark and Ahwesh by a score of
9-8.

“My returns were off and I
wasn’t closing like I should, and
we just lost it down in the
tiebreaker at the end,” said
Zielinski. “It was tough, we
fought to the end, but this time it
didn’t go our way.”

“Marla and I just couldn’t exe-
cute our win today due to some
problems that we had on the
court,” said Davis. “We weren’t
that consistent. She was playing
well when I wasn’t.”

Baker used her wicked serves
and lobs and Keister used her
keen net play to defeat Vierkom
and Hicks 9-7. '

nailing their fourth-place time of
40.43 seconds, which is also a
season’s best for the Panthers.

In the 110-meter high hurdles,
Jay Murphy took time out of his
busy schedule to take fourth
(14:25) with Wes Alexander ﬁn-
ishing in sixth._

Although they ran the day
before, the women’s tag team of
Zenia Ayrton, Joetta Purter,
Angie Martin and Lakeya Smith
did some more work in the
4x400—meter relay, winning the

' event by hitting an outdoor sea-

son-best time of 3:43.11 sec-
onds. ‘
In other women’s action,

third—year all-purpose athlete
Najuma Fletcher was at it again,
winning the 400-meter intenne-
diatehurdles (l:00.86), with
Zenia Ayrton taking fourth place
(1:O2.53). _

Also, in the 100-meter high
hurdles Fletcher earned a fifth-
place finish (13.90).

In the 800-meter run Angie
Martin took third, hitting a time
of 2:08.97, with Lakeya Smith
finishing in ninth place.

The Panthers will be partici-
pating in the Duke Relays this
weekend in North Carolina. The

“It was an easy match to
win,” he said. “I usually don’t
play very relaxed. I'had a
tough weekend, but it was
nice to get a win.”

Sullivan, a junior, and his
doubles partner, Frenza, also
won their match over
Amarsinghe and Robison.

“The team wasvery eager,

for a -win,” said head coach
George Dieffenbach, “so
it was a good chance to
get back on the winning
track.”

Dieffenbach is already look-
ing ahead to Saturday’s match

 

against St. Bonaventure,
which is considered to be a
very strong team.

“This match [against
Edinboro] really got our con-
fidence back, and that’s
important going into this
weekend’s match.”

Despite the Pitt win,
Edinboro did not have the tal-
ent that is expected to be dis-
played at the Big East
Tournament in Miami, which
is less than three weeks away.
St. Bonaventure isexpected to
be the strongest opponent
before the tournament. The

In other matches, the first-

match, 8-2, overpowering
Skrok and Salvatore with
