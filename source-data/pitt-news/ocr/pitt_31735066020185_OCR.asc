UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBU RGH

elebrationl
Bicentennial events

spark homecoming

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

Pitt Panther Pride.
It ‘burst out all over yesterday, con-

 cluding with the biggest fireworks’

display Oakland has ever seen.
Brilliant flashes of red, green, blue,

and gold lit up the south sky of the

campus asgWPTS provided. a simul-
cast of the display, with old familiar
songs such as, ”America the

Beautiful,” and Bruce Springsteen's

hit from last summer, ”Born in the

U.S.A."

Hundreds of students and alumni
stood on the Cathedral lawn admir-
ing the display, which lasted over a
half hour. Smiles and cheers broke
out as one spectacular display after
another jumpedaout of the clear night

sky.

A Just prior to the display, President
Wesley Posvar led the crowd, along
with the Pitt band and cheerleaders,
in a pep rally on the,Cathedra| lawn.

”We have spent a serious past few
days, looking back at our history,

_ with our convocation on Tuesday,”

Posvar said. ”Now it's time to have
fun.” ' ‘

”FootbalI isn't the most important
thing at this university,” he said. ”But
on Saturday, there is only one thing

 to do, beat Navy.”
”We have a great team, and agreat '

new coach. By the end the season we
will one of the best in the nation.
— Next year, will will be the best.”
The rally moved through several
songs and cheers, including a battle

between the band and students.

featuring cries of, ”B|ue!...GoId!" and
”Less Filling!...Tastes Great!”

The winner of the trip to _Cancun
contest sponsored by the Pitt Program
council was announced. Lauren

Giannini, came to the microphone to
receive the prize after two other
names were called.

. Laurie Allen, a junior, who chaired
the homecoming committee for the
PPC, said the week is going better
than she could have hoped.

”I was so worried about this day.
This was the day,” she said. "’I
wanted the students to have a good
time all at once.

”It was fabulous. We couldn't have
asked for more.”

Thousands of people lined Forbes
and Fifth Avenues as the parade,
which began at six o'clock and con-
cluded in darkness, wound around
the center of campus, taking over an
hour to conclude. .

Allen said the parade had 85 units,
twice the size of any previous Pitt
homecoming parade. Included were
seven high school bands and 14 drill
teams from the Westen Pennsylvania

area, along with the Pitt Band, Color

Guard, and Cheerleaders, and several

‘floats and vintage cars.

Grand Marshal Roy Rogers led the
parade, followed by President Posvar
and Pittsburgh Mayor Richard
Caliguiri.

Earlier in the clay, Posvar presented
Rogers with a medal of distinction in
honor of his achievements in public
service and philanthropy.

He arrived at the ceremony clad in
in his customary- cowboy outfit.
White hat, red kerchief, blue western-
style shirt, and-snug black pants tuck-
ed into tall, shiny black boots.

As’ he approached the podium,
Rogers said, ”ls this where‘I talk?"

”Or you can sing.” Posvar yelled
out from behind him. .

’’I went to the school -of hard

knocks, because I grew up during the

depression,” said Rogers.

”| feel blessed to be born in the
greatest era the country has ever
known,” he said. ”We have gone
from the horse and wagon, to putting
a man on the moon.”

‘Rogers introduced Lou Pappan,
who owns the chain of Roy Rogers
stores in the Pittsburgh area.

”Now there's a guy who can tell
you about America,” he said. ”He
came to this countryfrom Greece,
and he worked hard.

”Everything is work today. I don’t

_to work hard to get there.” T

Rogers then introduced his son and
talked about the importance of fami-
ly in America. He told the crowd
which had gathered in the Assembly
room of the Student Union, of the up-
coming 39th wedding anniversary he
and Dale Evans will celebrate this
New Year's Eve.

Rogers appeared uncomfortable

I speaking and jumped from topic to

topic. He said he was born in Cin-
cinatti and completed just two years
of high school before quitting to work
in a shoe factory to help support fami-
ly income. .

In his opening- remarks, Posvar ex
plained why Rogers was deserving of
the award.

’’It is suitable that this presentation
follows the honors _convocation with

its eminent, world-class scholars,”
Posvar said. ”We are moving from a

somber, academic occassion to the

fun of presenting an award to an
original American frontiersman.”

Posvar said it was very fitting that
Rogers receive the honor.

”He is known as achampion of
public service, has crusaded against
child abuse and is noted for
thousands of appearances for public
charity.” Posvar said. ”He is a great

American.” - V
Posvar wore for the remainder of

the day the brown cowboy hat given
him by Rogers at the ceremony. After

_receiving the gift, Posvar in turn gave

Rogers a t-shirt bearing the words,
”Happy trails to yins,” across the
front. '

The homecoming week celebra-

Students feel left out

By Eric Poole
Staff Writer

‘The Pitt Bicentennial celebration is
failing in its effort to get the student
body involved with the festivities, ac-
cording to students surveyed.

The problem, according to junior
David Taylor, is the lack of unity at
Pitt. ”There is no unifying force
[among the Pitt students}  It's’ par-
tially student apathy and partially the
fact that it's a commuter school,”
Taylor said. '

Taylor also cited a lack of student
involvement in the planning of the
bicentennial activities. ”What student
was ever asked, ‘What would you
like for your bicentennial?’ ” he
added. '

Some students felt that the problem
was a lack of individual student in-
volvement. ”There should be more
student events, instead of organiza-
tional events,” said John Murphy.

Todd Ware contended that Pitt
should have more entertainment
geared toward blacks. "To get blacks
involved in homecoming, they
should have some black-oriented
entertainment. At the Howard
[University] Homecoming,_ they are

having Anita Baker and other black
artists,” he said. ‘

Another problem with the
bicentennial celebration cited by
many students is the choice of Roy
Rogers as the homecoming parade
grand marshal.

Susan Luffe, a freshman, said she
felt Roy Rogers was definitely not the
best candidate for grand marshal.
”That’s like having Ronald
McDonald,” she said. -

Luffe suggested that the bicenten-
nial committee should have chosen
Mario Lemieux of the 7-0 Pittsburgh
Penguins. '

”At least people would come,”
Taylor said.

Luffealso said the major problem
with student involvement is a matter
of publicity. In her opinion, the com-
mittee should have publicized the
events in the city papers.

_ Three students disagreed. Staci Ver-
nick, Bill Stadtmiller and Doug Ben-
nett all said that the publicity of the
homecoming events was adequate.

' In Vernick’s opinion, ”The adver-
tising in The Pitt News and putting
up signs all over the place [was ef-
fective].’’ '

”l’ve been informed of the events,”
Stadtmiller agreed. ’

The five finalists for king are:
Micael Filvanio, Thomas Brooks,
Perry Ruzzetto, David Konkolics, and
Sean D’Amico.

The five finalists for queen are:
Cindy Clune, Sue Uhazie, Michelle -
Bellamy, Daria Dub, and Barb Brody.

Laurie Allen said the planning for
the week had been a long process
and, at times, staying with the work
was difficult. A

’’It was really a hassle sometimes,” .
she said. ”Today made it all worth-
while.”

Power goes. out
on Forbes Ave.

An explosion beneath the street
in front of McDonald's on Forbes
Avenue caused a power outage in
Oakland last night, leaving several
businesses on Forbes Avenue
without electricity for approx-
imately two and a half hours.

According to Joe Wanninger of
Duquesne Light Company, an’
underground transfer or cable
burned out at approximately 9:15
p.m. Electricity for the businesses
affected by the outage was swit-
ched over to another line just
before midnight. ' ’

”|t’s a shame that it happened
on a busy night like tonight,” said
Mike_ Tsouris, night manager at
Primanti Brothers’ Restaurant. .
”We’re all just sitting here in the
dark. We cleaned up a little ‘-
there's just not a whole lot we can
do without electricity.”

Primanti’s, along with Rax, C.J.
Barneys, McDonald's, and the
Original Hot Dog Shop, closed up
when the power went out. Tsouris .
said Pri.manti’s would wait out the
outage and reopen if the electrici-

  Moscow retaliates for U.S. expulsion of 55

MOSCOW — The Soviets ordered
five more U.S. diplomats to leave the
country Wednesday and ordered all
260 Soviet employees at the U.S. Em-
bassy in Moscow to stay home.

The Soviets also imposed restric-

tions on the number of Americans,

who can be stationed in the embassy
for temporary duty and . on the
number of foreign house guests in-
vited by Soviet diplomats.

The moves come one day after the
United States ordered 55 Soviet
diplomats to leave the country. Five
were expelled for ”activities not con-
sistent with their diplomatic duties,”
and 50 more were expelled . to
achieve parity between the number
of personnel stationed at embassies
and consulates in both countries.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov said the Soviet
Union would take further steps
should the United States choose to
take any further action.

The United States expelled the 55

after the Soviets kicked out five

American diplomats for alleged es-
pionage. Earlier, the United States
had ordered 25 Soviet diplomats to
leave the United Nations in New
York after American reporter
Nicholas Daniloff was arrested by
Soviet authorities and charged with
espionage.

The 260 Soviet employees who‘

failed to show up for work Thursday
included cooks, receptionists, maids,
mechanics and cleaning personnel.

FBI probes alleged
corruption in Boston

BOSTON — Federal and city law
enforcement agents announced
Thursday that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has been conducting a
major inquiry into allegations of
police corruption for the past two
years. a

At a news conference Thursday
morning, Boston officials, including

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS

Police Commissioner Francis
Roache, said they would not provide
any details of the investigation except
that subpoenas have been issued to
Boston policemen, members of the
city's liquor licensing board and
several other persons who do not
have any police connections.

Sources said the investigation is
one of the largest ever conducted in
a major city police force and would
disclose a widespread pattern of
bribery reaching into senior levels of
the Boston Police Department.

Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said
the inquiry would be good for Boston
because it would ”demonstrate
something the people of the city of
Boston have felt” and would restore
integrity to the police department.’

Meese steps up
war against porn

WASHINGTON —- In a move de-
signed to step up the war against
America's $8 billion-a-year _por-
nography industry, Attorney General
Edwin Meese unveiled proposals to
increase the Justice Department's
anti-smut role Thursday.

At a press conference Meese said,
”Porn peddlers will be pursued with
a vengeance and prosecuted to the
hilt.”

Among the Meese proposals are:
the setting up of a prosecution center
to train prosecutors and advise local
and state governments, the setting up
of a task force of at least six U.S.
lawyers to help prosecute ”the
organized criminal enterprises” that
control pornography, the elimination
of ”dia|-a-porn” services, the elimina-

The shanty is a
tasteless display

It's a shame.

The shanty that so timely appeared, several hours before the start
of the homecoming parade, on the lawn of the William Pitt Union
was uncalled for.

Granted, in the past — thanks in part to the athletic department
and to the administration in general — students at this university have
had plenty of chances to express their disgust with university policies.

Why now?

This week, the University of Pittsburgh kicked off its bicentennial
celebration. It is a time for the students to show pride and enthusiasm
that they attend the University of Pittsburgh.

Just last week, the university's board of trustees voted to continue
selective divestment.

According to President Wesley Posvar, out of approximately 100
colleges in the nation that are either partially or completely divesting,
Pitt is currently ranked 11th in the amount of South African in-
vestments sold.

That's not so appalling if you look at it realistically. Granted, it's
not that impressive of a record, but perhaps one should acknowledge

T progress.

The shanty is a ploy to draw attention to a cause — which it is ef-
fectively doing. But at the same time, it is an annoyance that detracts
from the celebration of the bicentennial.

Scranton’s giving
honesty a chance

This week, gubernatorial candidate William Scranton announced
his latest campaign strategy. From now until election day, his cam-
paign ads will no longer contain muds|in_ging of any type. He will
no longer dwell on his opponent's weaknesses to point out his
strengths.

Scranton’s move is noteworthy. At a time when mudslinging has
become an acceptable political practice, a decision to abstain from

i it is almost historical.

Last spring, Scranton did something else that was thought by many
to be political suicide. At a time when paranoia about drug use is
almost as common as mudslinging, Scranton publicly admitted that
when he‘was"a young man, he used illegal drugs.

These two events, especially the second one mentioned, are either
well thought out political strategies, or it are slips of the tongue. His
refusal to sling mud for the duration of the campaign may be one
last attempt to maintain his lead over Bob Casey until November.
But then again, they may not be. Perhaps-Scranton is trying a dif-
ferent strategy, one that's been around for a long time. It is hardly
used anymore. It's a little thing called integrity. V '

William Scranton has remained ahead of Casey throughout all of
this. Scranton’s success can be attributed to the fact that elections
can honestly be won with personal integrity, not with political games.
Scranton’s refusal to play these games is a compliment to you, the

Think about these points. Whom do you trust more, a man who

disguises his past political mistakes with the mistakes made by his
opponent, or a man who approaches an election with honesty about
his achievements and his shortcomings? The Pitt News hasn't officially
endorsed anyone in the state and local elections yet. Don't confuse
thisjeditorial with an endorsement. We are simply calling attention
to some unconventional and noteworthy political practices.

With regard to Dirk Kaufman's ar-

Notre Dame doesn't restrict drink-

And finally, the blatant misinforma-

an unqualified statement posited as

his claim: ”Notre Dame students

SDI isn't what you think

The beginning of wisdom in
understanding ”Star Wars” is realiz-
ing that it bears no relation to
anything President Reagan says about
it. ”Star Wars” is a joint product of
an unholy alliance of three different
components of the U.S. military-
industrial complex: the Pentagon
with its nuclear-war-fighting
strategists, the big defense contracting
corporations and the government
weapons research laboratories — Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore.

The following seven points give a
brief outline of some crucial features
of the latest innovation in the arms
race:

No. 1 — ”Star Wars” is prohibited
by the 7972 ABM Treaty. Moreover,
the treaty explicitly bans research on
any space-based missile defense
system (Art. V, para. 1), notwithstand-
ing the semantic contortions of the
administration's ”reinterpretation” of
the language of the treaty.

No. 2 — ”Star Wars” is not non-
nuclear. Certain crucial components
of the weapons system, as presently
conceived, are intrinsically nuclear,
such as the nuclear-pumped laser.
Further, it is likely that even the sup-
posedly non—nuc|ear components

(particle beam weapons and rail .

guns) will require nuclear power
plants based in space or on Earth/to
provide the prodigious amounts of
power that would be used. Thus
when President Reagan claims that
”Star Wars" is a non-nuclear defense
system, he is either lying outright or
knows almost nothing about what he
is talking about.

No. 3 —- ”Star Wars” is not intend-
ed to protect people. Reagan is the
only one who takes seriously the sug-
gestion that building weapons in

TIM,
VAN GELDIII

space could provide protection for a
population. Scientists, weapons
researchers and Pentagon strategists
have all concluded that, to be feasi-
ble at all, ”Star Wars” must be
employed in a more limited role.
Thus even supporters of ”Star Wars”
see it as a system designed only to
defend our nuclear arsenal. In this
role, the system would not have to
be perfect; rather, to be effective, it
would only have to guarantee that a
certain proportion of our weapons
survive a Soviet attack. Thus:

No. 4 — ’’Star Wars” is not de-
signed to replace deterrence. Rather,
it is envisaged as just one component
of an overall, integrated system of
nuclear deterrence. Deterrence, it is
claimed, is strengthened when no
side can be sure that in striking first,
it will destroy enough of the enemy's
weapons to ensure that a counter

strike would not be devastating. This V

is a valid line of reasoning, except
that it merely highlights the fact that
there are far cheaper and more
reliable ways of achieving this aim -
for example, placing missiles on sub-
marines, or the original MX basing
scheme.

Since ”Star Wars” is designed to
ensure the survival of our intercon-
tinental ballistic missiles in the event
of a Soviet attack — first strike or
retaliatory — it follows that:

No. 5 — ’’Star Wars” is _not a
defensive system. Rather, it is simp-
ly an integral part of an overall
'nuclear- offensive system. Instead of
doing away with our current system

of nuclear deterrence, it actually
enhances and entrenches it. Thus it
is wrong for any supporter of ”Star
Wars” to claim that he is trying to go
beyond mutually assured destruction,
while the opponent is trying to
preserve it. Rather, it is the opponent
of ”Star Wars” who aims to escape
nuclear deterrence via thewholesale
abolition of nuclear weapons — not
the addition of further weapons
systems to defend the ones we
already have.

No. 6 — ”Star Wars” is not going
to work. This conclusion is over-
whelmingly endorsed by the scien-
tific community. ”Star Wars”
research is being done by those who
stand to gain directly from the billions
that are being wasted — scientists
whose projects would otherwise be
too expensive, weapons researchers
who make a living out of the arms
race, and the technicians in big com-
panies which are making huge pro-
fits out of this open-ended research.

No. 7 — ”Star Wars” is one more
step in a long history of U5. attempts
to dominate the arms race through
technological innovation. Since the
invention of the atomic bomb, every
major innovation in nuclear weapons
technology, except the» hydrogen
bomb, was first introduced by the

‘ United States. Frustrated thatthe Rus-

sians have finally achieved a rough
parity in the overall balance of
nuclear forces, the administration is
attempting to do what every U.S. ad-
ministration has attempted. "since
1945 — reassert U.S. superiority
through technological advances that,
presumably, the Russians will be
unable to match. But history has
shown that this only leads to ever

more dangerous phases of the arms

race.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 24, I986

Yet another special kid

  

‘ ..a

 

. I just had the nicest conversation
with the most unusual young man.
His name is Doug Donnelly, he is 16
years old, and he lives in Ottawa
Lake, Mich. '

’’I probably cannot fit into your
average 16-year-old group,” he said.

’’Most 16 year olds have their minds ‘

on girls, basketball, football and rock
music. I admit those do rate 2, 3, 4
and 5 on my list. I .

”However, there is one thing that
is more important to me than any-
thing else in my life, and that is
newspapers.

”I don't know why, exactly. It all
began when I was about 7 or 8 years
old. I'd glance through newspapers,
andwl would get ideas — like where
I would put stories in different places
in the papers and where I'd add more
color. It was like I was an editor,
designing the pages.”

He said that he is the only person
in his family who is so crazy about

newspapers. Both his father and his
brother are long-haul truck drivers;
every week they travel from New
York to California. Dougis continual-
ly asking them to pick up local
newspapers for him along the way,
and when they get home, the first
thing he does is hop into the cabs of
their trucks and make sure there is a
stack of papers.

He loves the look, the feel, of
newspapers. ’’I would much rather
read a newspaper than watch TV
news,” he said. ”When you watch
TV, someone might say something,
and it goes right past you. If it's in the
newspaper, you can read it at your
own pace and really try to understand
the meaning. If you really like a par-
ticular story, you can cut it out and
save it. I do that all the time. I don't
know if anyone else does, but I cut
stories out and a month later I'll bring
them out and read them again."

Doug said that he has a scrapbook
in which he keeps the little pictures
of newspaper columnists that run
with their columns. ”I have pictures
of more than 200 columnists from all
over the country,” he said. ”The ones
I really like, I memorize what days
their columns appear. I like sports a
lot, for example, and my favorite
sports columnist is Mike Kowney of
the Los Angeles Times. I know that
he appears in the paper on Mondays
and Wednesdays.”

When he was 14, Doug talked a
community weekly into letting him
write a sports story every issue.

’lThe day my first byline appeared
was the proudest, happiest moment
of my life,’’ he said. ”When I got to

school, one of my teachers read it to
the rest of the class in case they had
missed it. And at the end of the story
there was a note that said, ’Doug
Donnelly is an 8th grader at
Whiteford School.’

”But then the paper folded because
of a lack of money, and I don't have
the column anymore."

That has not stopped him from hav-
ing ambitions. ”My main goal in life
is to be a newspaper writer,” he said.
”I really want to write in New York
— I don't know why, but I just do.
After I become a newspaper reporter
in New York, I want to do something
‘on the side — I want to write a book
about playground basketball in New
York. Then I'd like to become a sports
columnist, and after that I'd like to
become what I call a ‘noun colum-
nist’ — a columnist who writes about
people, places and things.”

His family still does not complete-
ly understand his love of newpapers,
he said. ”My mom used to think that
when I grew up a little bit, I would
stop being so crazy about news-
papers. But I actually read them more
now. When I got my driver's license,
it just _made it easier to go to the
drugstore and buy more papers.”

Doug is not sure why newpapers
hold such a magical appeal to him;
he just knows that they are a big part
of his life.and that he wants to make
them his whole life.

I've‘ been trying to figure out why
I enjoyed talking with Doug Donnel-
ly so much.

I think it's because I once knew a
kid just like him. ’

WESTI-IEIMER

Q. My husband is in great _
physical shape — jogs an hour
every day, plays a hard game of
tennis. That isn’t unusual at 30,
but after six years of marriage we
are down to sex once a month,
though he does gratify himself
more often. Our routine is in-
variable. He kisses me twice, goes
straight to five minutes of oral‘
foreplay, then begins intercourse.
It's all over in 70 minutes. He
won't let me stimulate him in any
way. I can't kiss him, and if I
touch him anywhere he flinches,
claiming to be too sensitive to
stand it. Needless to say, my self-
esteem is flat on the tarmac.

A. Your low self-esteem feeds
the bad interpersonal problem
you have with your husband. I
think you must stop abusing
yourself and, in fact, stop trying to
involve your husband in lovemak-
ing entirely. Stop all sex. If he
regards it as a burdensome month-
ly obligation, you only humiliate

 

yourself by permitting it. There is

no point in your trying to kiss or’

caress someone just to give him
a chance to flinch from you. i
This extreme behavior suggests

I somebody who is involved entire-

ly in himself and his own well-
being; logically, he prefers sex
with himself as well. Trying to im-
prove the monthly sex with him
only makes matters worse.
Instead, shop around for a sex
therapist. You and your husband
need marital counseling followed

by sex therapy; very probably _ -

there is something wrong be-
tween you besides sex, and the
sex itself obviously needs some at-
tention.

There is one cheerful note — his
hormonal condition must be in
good condition or he would not
be indulging in solitary sex. 50 his
problem is not physical but some-
thing that lives in the mind or
emotions, very likely rooted in
some resentment against you.

Q. I have always been attracted
to women younger than myself
and definitely slender. When I
married my wife of two years!
considered all her desirable
qualities and not_her looks, but
now I find her looks a problem.
Should I tell her that her heavy
body repels me? '

A. Even with all her good
qualities, she would resent that.
Especially since -you married her
with your eyes open, and she was
not deceptively packaged then.
With that unkind announcement
you would go from a wonderful
man who saw her real beauty, not
caring for externals, to a cruel
disappointment.

For The Pitt News

Pitt's Students for a Free South
Africa have contructed a shanty in
front of the William Pitt Union to
represent their rejection of universi-
ty policy on divestment.

’’If we can't work reasonably with
the university, we're going to have to
engage in activities like building the
shanty to demonstrate the will of the
university community,” said SFSA
member Ellen Dorsey.

’’It can't possibly have any affect
[on the university's divestment .
policy] except to raise people's con-
cern about fair play,” said university
president Wesley Posvar.

According to SFSA President Deb-
bie Gould, ”One of our objectives is
to increase student awareness and,
hopefully, participation.”

”We need to bring things to a point
where students demand divestment,”
said SFSA member Mark Lance.

is taken down by university
authorities.

for those who want to know more
about apartheid in~S/outh Africa.

SFSA did not seek university per-

Students build shanty to

Lance.

Posvar said, ’’I have approved its
location with the condition that they
take care of the site and protect the
safety of the people there and follow
university policy. It's a legitimate
form of demonstration so long as they
protect the safety of everyone.”

SFSA members said Pitt's bicenten-
nial is an opportune time to protest
the university's selective divestment
policy.

”This is a prime time to increase
the entire academic community's

awareness of Pitt's apathy towards"

the problem of apartheid in South
Africa,” agreed Pitt student Mike
Damp. .

”They [visitors to Pitt] are not go-
ing to see the recruitment brochure,
but the reality of what goes on at
Pitt,” said sophomore Scott Balcerek.

The touchstone of success for
a filmmaker is his ability to create

;a memorable film. This seems

obvious, but genius in the crea-

‘tion of any work of art lies in the
-artist's ability to imbue a crea-
' tion with unique visions, feelings
f and thought, forming a work of
j art.which will elicit emotion and

somehow touch those who wit-

ness it.

only recall the surreal and eerie
opening sequence in Night of
the living Dead , the apocalyp-

_ tic vision in the prologue to Day

noirskits of Creepshow. Romero

is a filmmaker who lurks in the
i human psyche, and once in his

element, proceeds to frighten
you out of yours.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers will
honor lvlr. Romero's contribution
to the cinema and the city of
Pittsburgh at the George A.
Romero Festival beginning today
and running until"Sunday, Nov.
2 at Pittsburgh Filmmakers’
Oakland screening room and at

the Fulton Theater downtown.

Eight Romero films and three
documentaries will be screened
at the festival. Also featured is a
panel discussing The American
Nightmare: The Sociology of
Horror, featuring Pitt professor
Dana Polen and a make—up and
special effects workshop hosted
by Tom Savini, Romero's long-
time special effects and make-up
artist. Savini, a Carnegie Mellon
graduate, has done work on the
lastlfour Romero-films, including

Day of the Dead and Creep-

show, in addition to authoring a

Romero will make a personal

‘appearance on the evening the.

”Dead” trilogy is featured at the
Fulton Theater on (when else?)
Halloween night. ’ ' '
The entire ”Dead" saga
began back in T968 when the
28-year-old Bronx native was
filming television commercials for
Calgon and Alcoa here in Pitts-
burgh. After attending Carnegie
Mellon University, Romero
decided to stay in town and in
his spare time wrote scripts for
films. Night of the living Dead,
a low—budget horror quickie,
was released through his Pitts-
burgh based production com-
pany to excited audiences and
apprehensive critics in T968.
Romero's first feature film
became a national cult treasure.

THE Pl1T NEWS, Friday, October 24, 1986

  ..lRomero

/Q’.

continued from page 7 '

It was to become to the horror
genre what Easy Rider was to
become to the motorcycle
genre. Both were low-budget
quickies thrown in from left field
with lightning force. Surprising-
ly, they both caught on, thus in-
spirin a slew of less than
remafT<abIe imitations; yet while
the motorcycle movies quickly
died out, the horror film con-
tinues to thrive — especially in
rental outlets.

Romero's direction was
praised for its demonstration of
uncanny wit and sense of humor
in creating a vivid visual score.
He went on to film Season of the
Witch in I972, in which a bored
housewife turns to witchcraft to
liven things up a bit while the old
man is traveling around the
country. The Crazies followed in
I973 and portrayed a biologi-
cal accident caused by the
government. As the town begins
to go mad," the army arrives.
Romero's vision matured with
The Crazies, and he be an to
pepper his films with socio ogical
issues. His innovation became
apparent as he injected intellect
in a genre where thoughtless-
ness and blood usually reigns
supreme.

He went on to do a series of
short sports documentaries for
NBC as well as a profile on the

Appﬁcaﬁons

problems of the elderly in his
I 975 documentary Amusement
Park. In I977, he directed his
own well-regarded story Martin,
which was a variation on the
Dracula theme.

The highly celebrated
”Dead" sequel, Dawn of the
Dead, was released in I979
and became famous here in
Pittsburgh before its release
because all of the action was
filmed at ivlonroeville Mall.
Romero's wit for metaphor and
talent for evoking fear produced
the superior effort in the ”Dead"
trilogy. The time was right, too.
Romero, who had been regard-
ed as a curiosity until then, had
polished the rough spots and
sharpened the edge, and a
steadily growing public was
aware of the ”Dead" myth and
wanted more.

Knightriders (I 98l ) is his most
unique film because it's very dif-
ferentfrom anything in Romero's
canon. A troupe of actors who
travel on motorcycles stage
medieval iousts, and a variety of
human relations are explored.
Yes,_ its weird, but it's utterly
fascinating.

Creepshow (I982) became
the inevitable breakthrough for
national recognition above and
beyond the cult status for which
Romero had been revered. With

  
   

/"6 T.

a script by Steven King and
loads of Hollywood stars like
Hal Holbrook, Ted Danson and
Adrienne Barbeau, Creepshow
was a terrific collection of tales
filmed as a tribute to the DC
Comic books of the I9’50s. King
and Romero were so well suited
for each other, it's amazing they
didn't get together earlier.

ne otiating to direct King's best-
sel ing novel Pet Semetary. (Per-
sonally, I can't imagineanyone
else directing it.)

Last year saw the release of
the last "Dead" installment with
Day otthe Dead, and Romero's
professionalism and artistic vi-
sions unified like never before.
He continues to improve the
medium he shaped single-

handedly.

 

Romero currently resides in‘

Sanibel, FIa., yet he still makes
his films in and around the Pitts-

burgh area, which has inspired-
other filmmakers to consider;

Pittsburgh as a filming location.
His films may often be lumped in-
to the horror bucket, yet Romero
considers this a stereotype;
Whereas horror films are often»

easy money—makers which-

feature a little sex and a lot of
blood, Romero's films examine
the human condition, the psyche
of man and the mortal soul to
reveal those horrors which are
internal.

sation seemed to be uncon-
trived, fairly simple and
straightforward, with overtones
of shyness and modesty,

‘ balanced by a self-confidence

somewhat tempered by a
natural ease. Being among the
fortunate few who managed to
get a ticket for her sold—out per-
formance, I discovered that her
expression in dance is much
more complex, subtle and in-

tricate than her verbal expres-E
. sion as demonstrated by what I

heard on the radio interview.

Her choreographic talents,
which she's been perfecting
since l978, have just recently
won her a Bessie Award, the
dance equivalentof the film in-
dustry's Oscar. With such a hef-

' .ty credential under her belt, she

gave her Pittsburgh audiences a

- series of five of her works in
,which she danced either as a

soloist or with the other four
members of her ensemble.

I found her compositions to be
somewhat subdued and limited
in that she. dealt with only a
small arc of the emotional spec-
trum. There were no soaring

jerky gestures quickly permu-
tated into lithe, gentle caresses.
Rigid, angular shapes just as
easily melted into elastic, rub-
bery forms at the blink of an eye.

Her dancing skills‘ were
perhaps best revealed in her
signature piece, ”Spending
Time Doing Things," set to Duke

. Ellington’s ”ln My Solitude.”

Starting off the dance in silence
in a bent over posture with her
left hand braced on her knee,
she moved her right hand, then
arm, in a series of more and
more complex gesticulations. By
the time the slow, mellow har-
monies of Ellington's classic final-
ly perfumed the air, she had

already been minutes into her‘

routine, moving in silence. She
often violated the sweet sounds
of the Duke with percussive leg
stomps, hand claps and body
slaps, which as she explained
later in" a question and answer
session following the perfor-
mance, are used to highlight cer-
tain parts of the composition.
Eventually she reached a point
where her body appeared to be
moving in five different directions
at once. This bit of visual
legerdemain was followed by

another silent sequence during *

which she continued to dance,
oblivious to both the quiet and

the audience, seeminglyyaware -

only of her own inner musings.

Miller and her ensemble
dance not only to music and
silence. Even the spoken word
seems to charge their collective
intellect and spirit with moving
images. For instance, ”Heart,
Heart" begins’ with the almost
song—like preaching of a black
minister, but later incorporates a
recited section of a literary work
by John Cheever into the piece.

Her performance opener, ti-
tled "A Haven For Restless
Angels of Mercy,” began with
the entire ensemble of dancers
squatting on the floor. With one
of them leading the way in a
series of kinetic gyrations, each
ofthe other dancers followed
suit by sequentially mirroring the
original's movements. The per-
formers were dressed in identical
white _T—shirts and grey sweat
pants which contrasted sharply
with the black screen
background, but they displayed
enough individuality to give
each finite personality, yet each

PITT vs.iNAVY  

PITT STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Charles Gladman rushed for 176 yardslin the"Homecoming
game last season, a 24-14 victory against North Carolina State.
Pitt has not lost at Homecoming since 1975.

\
\_\_‘ xx

\.\\\\\\\ \_\

When alumni return to campus
each year for homecoming, there are
three things they really want to see:

The old friends.

The old dorm.

The old football team.

At Pitt, athletic directors have
always gone out of their way to make
sure the alumni watch the Panthers
win at homecoming. Pitt has not lost
a homecoming game since 1975
when Navy posted a 17-0 shutout.

Pitt is 12-3-1 in its past 16
homecoming games. Most of the op-
ponents had aspirations for
something less than the national
championship. The homecoming op-
ponent last year was North Carolina
State, a team that finished 3-8.

But the Wolfpack won its
homecoming game last year  bare-
ly. They defeated Virginia, 23-22.

This year North Carolina State
plays Duke. It would make a better
basketball game. A

Pitt was 3-7-1 in 1984, their worst
season since 1972, but they still
managed not to lose the homecom-
ing game. The Panthers tied Navy,
28-28. ,

There is an old adage in college-
coaching lore that goes something
like this: ”Win the first game of the
year, the last game of the year and
homecoming —-— especially
homecoming — and you'll still be
working next fall.’’

That thinking is not lost with Mike
Gottfried, who will be coaching his

first homecoming game at Pitt this
afternoon against Navy.

”It’s a special game,” Gottfried
said. ”Anytime you tag homecoming
on a game it becomes special. This
is the one game every year to which
a lot of alumni come from far away
to see the game.” 1

Gottfried has, of course, coached
in homecoming games since his
career began, but one game in par-
ticular stands out.

”I think my most memorable
homecoming game was when we
beat Oklahoma when I was at Kan-
sas," Gottfried said. ”That was a very
big win for us.”

There are other memories Gottfried
would -rather forget.

”It seemed like when I was at Cin-
cinnati, one ' year we were
everybody’s homecoming oppo-
nent,” recalled Gottfried. ”I saw
more floats that year than I ever did
in my life. I also met Bob Hope at
four different homecoming games
that season.”

This year /Gottfried will meet Roy
Rogers, grand marshal of the
homecoming parade.

Gottfried disagrees with the charge
that schools intentionally schedule
cream puffs as their homecoming op-

”Just remember,” he reminded,
”Navy beat us last year.” .

Purdue played Northwestern in
their homecoming game this year.
Really, the Boilermakers didn't have
much of a choice. Northwestern is
about the only team in the Big 10
Purdue has a reasonable chance of
beating these days.

Other schools on Pitt's schedule
this year are less blatant than Purdue
about scheduling the Little Sisters of
the Poor on homecoming day, but
not by much.

Penn State, the master of the easy

schedule, beat Syracuse in its
homecoming game this year. Last
year the Nittany Lions played West
Virginia. A nice gesture, but it was a
year too late to play a talented Moun-
taineer team. .

Speaking of West Virginia, you
have to give them credit. This year's

homecoming opponent was Miami, '

the best team in America. Oh sure,
West Virginia was crushed 58-14,

I but, hey, they gave it a shot.

It's easy for good teams to schedule
bad teams for homecoming, but what
do the truly terrible teams do? To find
out I went to the source — North-
western University, tradition_ally con-
sidered the worst college football
team on the face of the earth. It turns
out that Northwestern J tends to

schedule teams that they still'can’t

beat. But at least they won't get
blown out by them.

THE Pirr NEWS, Friday, ocreberf24, 1986

Fans welcome

if Journey with

open arms

By lke Shibley

When l called my girlfriend to
tell her that Journey was coming
to Pittsburgh, she got very ex-
cited and started talking very
loudly into the phone. Right then
I began to thinkthatl had made
a mistake and should not have
called. To make matters worse,
she called me back lO minutes
later and told me that she was
going to bring a friend and that
l should purchase three tickets.
l wasn't sure what l had gotten
myself into.

As we rode downtown this
past Sunday night, my mind was
eased a little by the sight of a
young man with a slightly bored
look on his face sitting next to an
overexuberant girl who was
holding two Journey tickets. I

T soon realized that l was not the

only male there who had come
along as a favor to his irlfriend.

l sat there contented y amidst
15,000 people milling around
the Civic Arena before the per-
formance. The crowd was a di-
verse one. I saw girls who were
l4 and couples who were near-
ing middle age. What l saw

most, though, were college_

students and other people bet-
ween the ages of l8 and 24
who had grown up with Jour-
ney. This was the music that they
had listened to in iunior high

school right up through college. ,

Journey was a part of the life of
almost every person there, and
l was included. But likel have
said, these thoughts did not oc-
cur to me until later.

The evening opened with a
highly professional set by a new
English band called Glass Tiger,

who are currently enjoying the PRICE LIST: A

walked onto the stage, and l ac-
tually felt a chill. Steve Perry then
broke into ”Only the Young”
and the fun started.

Gradually, Journey started to
impress even the apathetic
males in the crowd. l mean they
were rea//y. impressive. They
played one big hit after another,
and the excitement. never let up.
ln fact, it kept building. When
the concert seemed to have
reached its apex and the elec-
tricity could not have gotten any
more intense, another song was
played that lifted the crowd
even higher than before.

Steve Perry, Neil Schon and
Jonathan Cain are the core of
Journey now, and it was ob-
vious by the fan response that
those were the three the crowd
came to see. Steve Perry sound-
ed as good as he does in the
studio, maybe better, and hit
almost every note perfectly. He
is one of those rare lead singers
that has a truly beautiful voice
and, boy, does he use it.

Neil Schon played a mean
and masterful guitar when called

for, but alsoplayed the more

melodic songs with graceful

A ease. When he took center

stage for a five-minute -solo,

which is usually the worst part of
a rock concert, his playing was
tasteful and even enioyable.
Not only is he a magnificent
guitarist, but he has a likeable
presence while on stage, or as
my girlfriend put it, "He is so
damn cool about his guitar play-
mg.

Jonathan Cain had his mo-
ments on the keyboard and was
not'to be overshadowed by
either Perry or Schon. His finesse
with the ivories helped to make
some of the slower songs like
"Open Arms" and "Faithfully"
truly memorable. A

There were so many highlights
to the concert that l couldn't
begin to mention all of them.
They played all their hits from
old to nevi/“and missed none of
the favorites. The most har-
monious moment of the evening
was when the entire crowd
swayed in unison while -the band
played ”Lovin’, Touchin’,

Journey performed before 16,000 fans at the Civic Arena.

Squeezin'." The number that
really got the crowd rockin' was
"Separate Ways,” which was
one of the last numbers before
the encore.

Journey may not have a lot to
say in their music, and they may
not have the‘ most intricate
rythms, but they know how to

entertain. I am not sure if
anything will ever top this con-
cert for pure entertainment
value.

l would have never thought it
possible, but I truly enioyed the
show, as did almost everyone
there. When Journey took their
final bows, all l6,000 people in

the Arena were standing, and

boyfriends were not doing it to i
make their girlfriends happy. if
did not realize just how many off"
their songs I knew by heart, but ,‘
I sang alongwith most them.» lg,
don't think I will ever forget this ,
concert. Like I said, Journey is at

part of my life.

Some things take years  develop.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 24, 1986

IOOOOOOOO990000OOOOOOOOOOOOOQOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Newman and Cruise chalk up a winner

By Ike Shibley

The Co/or of Money is essen-
tially a remake of the l96l film
The Hustler. Yet this new film is
a story unto itself. The characters
are developed fully enough that
The Color of Money does not
have to "be viewed in conjunc-
tion with its 25-year-old
predecessor.

Paul Newman and Tom Cruise

I are magnificent together. Cruise
has honed his acting ability to a
considerably sharper degree
than in any of his previous work.
He has a likeable, cocky attitude
in_ the film that allows him to
relate well to Newman, who is
cool ~~ and calm in situations
where Cruise gets excited.
Newman gets better with age.
His blue eyes will still cause
hearts to melt, but his rugged ex-
terior can still cause fear in those

I

he confronts. Together the two
are masterful, and they make
everything fall into the right
pockets.

Newman reprises the role of
Fast Eddie Felsen in this film. Ed-
die is an older liquor salesman
who spends his time watching
pool players. At the beginning of

the film his attention is caught by =

Vincent Lauria, played by
Cruise, who is winning game
after game of nine-ball. Eddie
decides to take Vincent under his
wing and teach him how to use
his talent as a pool player to
make money. The two go on a
cross-country trek that takes
them into a variety of pool halls,
where Vincent perfects his game
and his attitude. Atlantic City is
their final goal where Vincent
will compete in a h_igh-stakes
pool tournament. There are
twists to the story, but nothing

that strays too far from this basic
storyline. The movie is essentially
about the maturing of a good
pool player-into a smart one.

The female companion of Vin-
cent Lauria is Carmen, played

by Mary Elizabeth Mastran-V

tonio. She plays her role with a
toughness and smartness that at
times overshadows Cruise.
Carmen's insightfulness and her
love of money help‘ to make Vin-
cent a better hustler. Her role is
central to the movie, but the
screenwriter never seemed able
to decide whether this role was
to be major or minor. Due to this
indecision, the audience is in-
trigued by Carmen but then not
allowed to get to know her any
better because the script shifts its
focus back to Vincent and Eddie.

The Co/or of/I/ioney had high
caliber technical proficiency.
Billiard balls were shot from all

angles and at various speeds,
which helped to make the entire
film more enioyable. The cam-
era work was exceptional
throughout the film, and the in-
telligent use of the camera can
be attributed to the director,
Martin Scorsese.

Scorsese has taken an ade-
quate script and molded it into
a top-notch film. This may not be
his best work, but it should gain
him even more respect in Holly-
wood’s cinematic circle. He
takes the audience right into
pool rooms and makes them feel
a part of what is happening on
the screen. His timing is master-
ful, as is his use of cinematogra-
phy. The Hustler won an Oscar
for its cinematography, and
there seems to be no reason
why The Co/or ofMoney could
not do the same.

tina’/on Sunday?

Could these words have come
from the same woman who, just
a year ago, proiected in her
lyrics a world populated by self-
centered men concerned only
with hurting women? Indeed, 'Til
Tuesday's Aimee Mann has ma-
tured. Her outlook and lyrical
style on her band's new album,
We/Come Home, are especial-
ly refreshing in light of her
previous gloominess.

The underlying optimism and
possible religious implications of
”On Sunday” make it one of
I\/Iann’s finest lyrics. ”No One Is
Watching You Now" is excel-
lent as well; Ivlann suffers reiec—
tion but feels sadness for her
lover, not herself — a surprising,

Pop craftsman fine-tune
their pop melodicism

Mann's singing, while perhaps
a bit overwrought on We/come
Home's first single "What About
Love,” is usuallywarm, well-
controlled and convincing on the
new LP. Ivlann makes lines like
Don’t you /(now that / Cou/d
ma/<e/a dream that's bare/y ha/t

awake come true, from ”Com-

ing Up Close” magical and ’

makes good use of her expand-
ing vocal range.

The rest of ’Ti| Tuesday's
members needed little improv-
ing; I985’s Voices Carry was
buoyed by smart, tasteful play—..
ing from guitarist Robert Holmes,
synthman/pianist Joey Pesce
and drummer Micheal Haus-
man. Their performances on

"swamp" or "swampy," or my
personal favorite, "swamp
rocker." As you can see, I've
already defeated myself, but the
point is that those phrases pop
up so often because Fogerty's
music does sound deeply rooted
in the Bayou.

J.C. has never scored many
points for artistic growth. Listen
to Eye of the Zombie's "Change

probably ask yourself if the
rhythm section is Doug Clifford
and Stu Cook of CCR. The song

has a coiled tension and an un— . 5

mistakable thump that's been a
Fogerty trademark since "Born
on the Bayou." The atmosphere
coniures up a spongy land mass
intermittently covered with foul
water. In other words, it's real,
real swampy.

All of Zombie's nine tunes fall
neatly into two categories.
"Change in the Weather,"
"Violence is Golden" and the ti-
tle track feel as comfortable as
the flannel shirts that Fogerty's
been sporting since he first set
sail on the Green River. The two
occasions where he does try on
some new styles are the Atlan-

Overall, though, John Foger-
ty delivers what people expect
from him. He makes no gra
statements, and for that I'm
grateful. He may discuss the cor-
porate sponsorship of rock ’n’
roll ("Soda Pop"), but if you in-

tend to buy this album, you're-

probably more concerned with
the power and glory of his chord
changes.

That's too bad. J.C'. is a pret-
ty earnest guy who is also pret-
ty articulate. But then again, if
you didn't want Fogerty to stray
far from the swamp, Eye of the

The bicentennial celebration: a reason to be proud

Nobody I know, outside of some
mentioned in the Bible, hasulived to
be 200 years old.

The University of Pittsburgh has
been around that long and has begun
to celebrate its bicentennial, cheating
a bit by a few months.

The school was started as the Pitts-
burgh Business Academy in 1 787, as
the banners throughout Oakland re-
mind us daily. Then, in 1819 the
name was changed to Western
University of Pennsylvania (our teams
were calledthe WUPs). Finally, in

‘ 1908 it became the ‘University of Pitt-

sburgh.

In 1926, on a rainy Monday morn-
ing (Sept. 27 to be exact), construc-
tion began on the Cathedral of
Learning. Pittsburgh school children
were urged to send in a dime to buy
a brick to help build it.

More than anything — ‘no matter
our rank or our place in the pecking
order at Pitt — this 200th birthday
should serve as a reminder that the
University of Pittsburgh is bigger than
any of us and all of us. It is a legacy.

No matter what we are, ad-
ministrator, instructor, staff member
or student, we are simply borrowing
some of its precious time.

For the majority of us, that means
four years. Some of us are lucky
enough to grab off another four years

and renew..the rich experience that ,

was there the first time around. But

even then, how does eight years or
80 years figure, or matter much jn the
life of something that has lasted and
prevailed for nearly 200 years?

Pitt is bigger than Bill Fralic, as I
reminded him many times. Dan
Marino, Hugh Green and Tony
Dorsett are doing their thing
somewhere else — like Fralic. But the
Cathedral of Learning is still standing
tall like no other school building in
the country.

Walk through the first floor of the
Cathedral of Learning —'that Gothic
chamber where you can imagine
prisoners chained to the walls when
you can't concentrate on your
Spanish studies under those warm
lights in its alcoves, and you just
know the building abounds with
ghosts.

Great leaders and great teachers
and great students and great
secretaries (and some not-so-greats
and ingrates) have spent ‘time there
and worn its stone floor flat and
shiny, and more are yet to come.

Sitting in an office at Pitt Stadium,
a funny place to work or write, think-
ing about Pitt brings back many
pleasant and not-so-pleasant
memories of my own student days
here from 1960 to 1964 — back in
the medieval period.

It was a fun place to be right from

the start. The Pirates pulled off a '

miracle in the first two months of

school and won the National League
pennant and then the World Series.
Bill Mazeroski hit his home run and
slew the mighty Yankees in seven
games. That was at old Forbes Field,
right across the street from the
Schenley Hotel, now the beautifully
refurbished William Pitt Union.

I was there just the other night to
help honor Steelers-owner Art
Rooney and his family, and it too
brought back all the good times and
bad times: the grades, the girls, the
gurus, the good times at Gustine’s
(now Hemingway's), the games, the
girls, the tests (Oh those tests!), The
Pitt News, WPGH (now WPTS), The

' Owl (now Panther Prints).

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1986

By John -Enright

Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers take on the Navy
Midshipmen tomorrow afternoon at
Pitt Stadium. Although first-year
coach Mike Gottfried isn't predicting
a victory, for the first time since he's
been at Pitt he feels relaxed.

”For the first time since I've been
here I feel the transition period may
be over,” said Gottfried. ’’It now feels
like everyone is on the same page.
Everybody understands where we're
at and what we're doing. But that
doesn't mean all our problems are
out of the way.”

It certainly doesn't. The 3-2-1 Pan-
thers have been an inconsistent foot-
ball team all year. They appear to be
quite superior to the Midshipmen
(3-3), but Pitt can't afford to have that
attitude for two simple reasons.

No. 1: Navy defeated the Panthers
last season at Annapolis 21-7.

No. 2: Navy tied Pitt 28-28 at Pitt
Stadium in 1984.

Gottfried insists that that is enough‘
evidence to prove that his team is in
no position to take Navy lightly.
”You just have to go back to last year
and see that Navy beat us,” com-
mented Gottfried.

However, a closer examination
shows that this is a matchup between
two teams going in opposite
directions.

The Panthers have won three of
their last four games, and they are
coming off a big win at Notre Dame
two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Navy
has lost its last two games to Air Force
and Penn, and that may not be the
end of it. Navy coach Gary Tranquill
thinks his team hasn’_t hit rock bottom
just yet. ”We’ve had a penchant for
self-destructing,” said Tranquill. ’’I
don't know what we're going to do
week to week. We may be going a
little bit backwards.”

Unlike disciplined Navy teams of
the past, this year's squad has had
trouble hanging onto the football.

The Midshipmen have turned the ball ~

over 22 times this season.
Pitt's improving defense, led by All-
America candidate Tony Woods, has

I was so smart back then and so ig-

norant HOW.

There have been so many great
people who have graced this place.
I've written the scho_ol?s sports
history, and Bob Alberts has written
about the whole shebang —— about all
the significant things that have hap-
pened here in his just-published book
that you ought to pick up at the Pitt
Book Store.

Some of the most famous people
who have been here were and are
athletes.

But even the jocks must take a back
seat to some scientists who worked
here. _‘

Nobody ever did anything as im-
portant at Pitt as Dr. Jonas Salk and
a team that included Julius Younger,
L. James Lewis, Byron L. Bennett, Per-
cival I. Bazeley and Lurich Krech
(they should retire their white lab
coats). They were doing research
here, and in 1955 they developed an
anti-polio vaccine.

Nobody ever said anything more
significant than Dr. Salk when he
said, "We have the serum.”

And, all of a sudden, kids and their
parents did not have to fret when they
went swimming on a sultry summer
day. They would not have to worry
about getting polio, being paralyzed
or ending up in wheelchair.

-Last spring, when I was playing the
Pied Piper to a group of area grade

Panthers hoe to sink ay tomorrow afternoon

to enjoy watching film of turnover-

crazy Navy. . .
Tranquill likes what he sees of Pitt's

big No. 90, though h_e probably

won't feel that way after the game. .

Ill

always enjoy watching Tony
Woods play on film,” said Tranquill.

.”There’s probably 15 to 20 in-

dividuals in the country like him who

you tend to watch rather than the

scheme of things. He's a great
player."

Woods is just one of the weapons.

Pitt has assembled for tomorrow's
game. Quarterback John Congemi
and tailback Charles Gladman, mak-

ing his first start since the Purdue con-_

test, could turn this game into a rout
with fine performances.

Gladman will start alongside
sophomore Craig ”lronhead”
Heyward. This could well be one of
the best backfield combinations in
the country in terms of natural talent.

Does this mean Panther fans could
be in for an afternoon of knock ’em
down, grind ’em out, running foot-
ball — something they haven't seen
too often this year? Gottfried won't
say for sure, but the possibility is
there. ’’It all depends on the situa-
tion,” Gottfried said with a smile. ’’In
other words, I'm not saying."

Besides questions about his game

plan, another subject which Gottfried ,

doesn't like is routs '—— like the talk-
of Pitt stomping the Midshipmen to-
morrow. While the Panthers have tal-
ent, Gottfried insists they are not one
of those top-notch college teams who
can play without emotion and still
win.

But Tranquill, on the other hand,
doesn't exactly sound confident
about his team's chances despite
their success against Pitt the last two
seasons. ”We’|l try and play as hard
as we can and see what happens,”
said Tranquill. A

The Panthers can't afford to lose
this game if they hope to keep bowl
hopes alive. The week Pitt had off
between Notre Dame and Navy may
have helped toward those hopes. ’’It

was a much needed open date, be-_

cause it gave us a chance to get some

school students and taking them on

them in and out of Fitzgerald Field
House and Trees Hall, holding back
the traffic on Sutherland Drive and

pointing out Salk Hall, one of them
held up his hand and asked, ”Why

is everything around here named

after somebody?”

It is to remind all of us that great
people have preceded us at the
University of Pittsburgh.

_ They have set high standards for all
of us. Our new football coach, Mike

Gottfried, likes to talk about his

predecessors, great coaches like Pop
Warner, lock Sutherland, I John
Michelosen and Johnny Majors. He
reminds his troops that they have a
heritage to live up to. He also tells
them not to just spend their time, but

to invest it. It is good advice for all ’

of us.

Our heritage is something that”

should motivate all of us, during our
short stays at Pitt, to do our best and
to make a positive impact at Pitt.

The bicentennial should be a«
humbling experience for everyone at
Pitt. Hail to Pitt! Happy 200th
birthday!

Autumn is here again. It is late Oc-
tober, and gold leaves cover the
ground. College campuses every-
where are preparing for the highlight
of the fall — homecoming.

Homecoming this year at Pitt will
be just a cut above the other celebra-
tions around the country. Everybody
knows that 1986 is the University of
Pittsburgh's 200th anniversary, but
not many people realize that 1986 is
also the 50th anniversary of Pitt's
1936 National Championship foot-
ball team.

The Varsity Letter Club has
reunited the '36 Panthers for this
homecoming weekend. Returning
are three of the four "Dream

and Marshall "Biggie" Goldberg

ther offense. Other members of the
1936 team returning this weekend
are: Ted Schmidt, Steve Petro, Arnold
Greene, Averell Daniel and Al
Leeson, while a few others are
probable.

Bowl. Pitt locked up the National
Championship by shutting out
Washington 21-0. Dr. John Suther-
land's team turned in a great perform-

_ance in the fall of '36. The great

performances have continued
through the years. Individuals have
risen to the occasion. Pitt players
shine even more than usual during
homecoming.

Some great individual efforts have
been turned in by Pitt players during
homecoming games over the years.
On his way to becoming Pitt's second
all-time leading rusher, Elliot Walker
scored four touchdowns against Tem-
ple in the 1974 Homecoming battle.

And who can forget 1976? Tony
Dorsett put on a show for the
homecoming crowd. The three-time
All-American ran for 212 yards in a
45-0 rout over Army. -

Another Pitt All-American per-
formed well in a homecoming game.
In 1981 Dan Marino threw for 252
yards in that homecoming victory.
Marino's victim was a hapless Syra-
cuse team. Pitt players always excel
in homecoming games, and last year
was no different.

In a 24-10 victory over the N.C.
State Wolfpack last season, several
Pitt players stood out above the rest.
When the passing game became stag-

Adolph   Coors

the Inter-

Saluting the '36 National Champs

nant, Foge Fazio began giving the
ball to Charles Gladman. Gladman
responded by running for 176 yards
and a touchdown.

Gladman’s offensive barrage was

— good, but the defense was better. The

defense had its share of stars also.
Bob Buckowski recorded a season

high of three-and-a-half sacks, and _

Tony Woods recovered two fumbles.
Woods’ second recovery was for a
touchdown, and it sealed the victory
for Pitt. ' -

These two players combined with
the rest of the defense to hold the
Wolfpack to a total of 14 yards
rushing — another great homecom-
ing performance. Recently Pitt has
been turning in a lot of good
homecoming performances. '

Over the last 16 years, Pitt has
compiled an impressive 12-3-_1
record in homecoming games at Pitt
Stadium. Believe it or not, Pitt has not
lost a homecoming game since John
Majors was head coach in 1975
against Navy, of all teams.

Pitt has faced Navy in four of the
last 16 homecomings. The Panthers
are 2-1-1 against the Naval Academy.
But this year is different. There is a
new coaching staff at Pitt. This time
out, Mike Gottfried will be at the con-
trols. He will have to stop the profi-
cient passing of Navy's potential
All-America quarterback Bill Byrne.
Can the Panther defense stop Navy?
Everybody will know by Saturday
night.

If the recent trend continues, Pitt
should walk away with a victory on
Saturday. There could be no better
way to salute. the surviving members
of the 1936 championship team, or
to start off the university's 200th an-
niversary on a positive note. A vic-
tory on Saturday would be an
excellent finish to a very special
homecoming at Pitt.

For The Pitt News

Editor's Note: This is the last
segment of a three-part series
about sophomore Robert Jordan's
attempt to "make the Pitt basket-
ball team as a walk-on.

Next year would be so-o-o
sweet if I was cleared to play.

Thursday afternoon, Oct. 16 —
Well, that's it. Time to hang up the
old hi-tops. That's it for me. I
know John Luther is in. He de-
serves it a whole lot. He's worked
real hard, and he earned his spot.

The other guy will probably be
Scott Colombo. He played with

‘ Doug West at Altoona High
School. His scrappiness and hus-
tle won over the coaches during
drills today. I think I should be
there, but obviously Coach isn't
going to waste time with me when
he can have players who can play
in the games. I wish them both
well. At least my interview with
the Press went well. The article
appeared in today's edition of the
paper, and they had a bit to say
aboutme. I'll make copies of the
article and sendthem home. It
hurts to be the best player and not
make it because of my grades. I
can't really blame anyone except
myself, so I'll have to live with
that. I'll go up and congratulate
Scott and John; they're two nice

guys. I played with John during in-

One man's last days as
a college basketball
walk-on player

tramurals last year, and I played
with Scott after the season ended.
What now for me? Well, I'll just
concentrate on getting my grades
back to my personal standards
and writing for The Pitt News.
After all, I do know something
about the game of basketball.
Sigh. It was fun while it lasted.
I can say that Coach Evans is a
fair man, and he has an excellent
staff. I learned a lot in a short
amount of time. I sincerely hope

‘ that the team does well. I have a

lot of friends on the team, and
they all know that I'll be rooting
for them. If discipline means
anything, then this will be a very
good team. I wish Coach Evans
and the guys all the luck in the
world, and maybe we can finish
higher than sixth in the con-
ference. Personally, I think we can
challenge for the top of ‘the Big
East.

Friday, Oct. 17 — How's this
for irony? Exactly one year ago to-
day, I was cut by Coach Chipman.
My thoughts are the same as last
year; what now? Can I make the
adjustment from participant to
spectator? Last year I didn't have
any answers. This year I do, but
I feel the same way. I called home
and told my family the news.
They didn't take it too well. Oh
well, life goes on. I sent them the
article, so at least they have that.
My only question now is this:
When do intramurals begin?

THE PITT NEWS, -Friday, October 24, 1986

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

At this time of year, when the
leaves are changing color and the
air is becoming noticeably colder,
thoughts of collegiate women ten-
nis players in the East focus on the
biggest challenge of their season
—— the Big East tennis cham-
pionships.

Nine Division One universities
will travel to Villanova Universi-
ty this weekend to compete in the
Big East tennis championships.
Pitt will be among them.

Syracuse University has been
picked as the favorite to win the
title again this year. Syracuse has
won three of the last four titles and
looks strong again this year due to
the return of six veteran players.

Boston College is predicted to

duplicate their second place per-
formance of last year. Boston Col-
lege has a strong tennis program
with a lot of depth and some of
the freshest tennis talent in the
nation. ‘

What about Pitt? This is the in-
evitable question all Pitt tennis
fans are likely to "ask. The team's
past performances at the Big East
championships are not encourag-
ing. They are in fact rather
discouraging. The Pitt women's
tennis team has finished in last
place all of the four years they
have competed in the cham-
pionships.

Possibly the best way to view
this situation is the way Coach
George Dieffenbach does.
”There’s only one way we can go,
and that is up,” he stated recently.

The Lady Panthers’ season

Tennis team at Big East tourney

 

Lady Panther freshman Tracy Feltingoff hopes for a good performance at the Big East
Championships this weekend.

record is better this year. They
were 7-5 in season play as op-
posed to last year's 7-6 record.

Tennis ability is only part of do-
ing well at the Big East. Mental
toughness is necessary also. Junior
team member Carrie deVera prob-
ably expressed this best when she
said, ”There is a lot of good ten-
nis up there, but we can't let that
intimidate us. Instead, we have to
concentrate on winning our in-
dividual matches and hopefully
upsetting some of the weaker
teams.”

The championships will be held
today, Saturday and Sunday.

The chance is there for the Pitt
women's tennis team to improve
their Big East standing. It is likely
with the unity and determination
they have displayed this year that

they will.

Panthers at Classic

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball team
is looking for a few strong volunteers
—— Tennessee Volunteers, that is. One
of the best teams in the Southeast
Conference, Tennessee (19-3) has
beaten Pitt "three times in the past
three seasons. After ending a
12-match win string, Pitt is out for
fresh blood.

Lisa Stewart has more than sting-
ing losses for personal motivation‘.
Stewart is a transfer from Tennessee.
Coach Shelton Collier said, ”Last
year, Lisa played one of her best
matches of the season against Ten-
nessee."

Tennessee is not the only tough op-
position in the Lady Panthers’ path
this weekend.'National|y ranked Pur-

’’It also gave us a couple of extra days

As always, Gottfried is confident

Florida State, first in the Metro Con- I in in

Lady Panthers, now 21-6, need to
beat the Seminoles if they want to

maintain any hopes of an elusive na- "

PANTHER NOTES: One player Pitt

Chuck Smith. The 5-10, 190-pound
running back has rushed for 790
yards on 155'carries and has caught
23' passes for 256 yards in six games
this year.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 24, T986

Soccer team continues losing ways

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers soccer team con-
tinued their downward slide Wed-
nesday night, being blanked by the
Robert Morris Colonials 2-0. Pitt has
now lost four of its last five games.

’’It was a tough loss,” said Pitt
coach Joe Luxbacher. ”Our guys
gave a good effort, but you have to
make the most of your chances. We
did not do that.”

At the beginning of the first half
both teams came outfighting, but
neither could put the ball into the net.-
A bad pass or missed shot would turn
them back.

A couple of times the ref had to
step between players to prevent a
fight. The game was then a defensive
battle; neither offense could break
through. Then with eight minutes left
in the half, Pitt got through, but the
ball was kicked too hard, and it went
out of bounds. That was one of many
scoring threats that the Panthers
couldn't capitalize On. Robert Mor-
ris’ threats were either turned away
by the Pitt defense or by goalie Mark
Hendricks. The half ended 0-0.

It was a relatively uneventful first
half, but one thing did stand Out. It
didn't happen on the field, but on the
sidelines. Robert Morris coach,Tom
DeRosa was upset with the way the

referee was calling the game. He was
running up and down the sidelines,
giving the ref a piece of his mind,
when one of the Pitt fans caught his
attention by suggesting that he sit
down. When he turned around, the
same fan asked if he needed a whis-
tle. DeRosa turned back to the field
for a couple of seconds, then turned
back and gave the fan a crude gesture
with his hands. Nobody sitting there
could believe what they had just
seen. The fans got fired up, but it
wasn't enough to get the Pitt players
on track.

The Panthers came on the field at
the start of the second half with‘a lot
of intensity. The game was played on
the Colonials’ side of the field, but
again Pitt couldn't get the ball into
the net. This was due in part to the

fact that they took some bad shots I
and that Robert Morris goalie Scott

Westcott was playing a good game.

Then with 30:40 left, Robert Mor-
ris drove down the field. They
managed to get Hendricks out of the

play and had a wide open net. As the '

ball was going in, Pitt player Chuma
Emejula deflected the ball with his
foot, and the game remained

scoreless.

One minute later the Colonials
were down near the goal again. This
time Tony Bunbury put the ball into
the net, and Robert Morris led 1-0.

”This was the best game we have
played all year,” said Coach DeRosa.
’’I think we played a little over our
heads, probably because of the inter-
city rivalry and all that.”

’’I don't think we played with
much intensity,” said Jeff Vargas. ’’It
was a poor effort.”

With 23:57 to go, the ball was in
the Panther net again. This time Col-
onial Chris Geraci came away
Celebrating the goal. Robert Morris
was ahead 2-0.

”We wanted it really bad. This is

- our biggest game of the year,” said

Westcott. ’’It was one for the books.”

Pitt pressed the rest of the game.
They had numerous scoring opportu-
nities, but Couldn't put the ball into
the net. Over the course of the game,
Pitt outshot Robert Morris 17-8, but
the bottom line is that you have to
score. Pitt couldn't do that, and as a
result they lost 2-0. _

”We had our chances, but every
time something good would happen,
it wouldn't go our way,” said Panther
Seckin Ablack. ’’It really was a tough
loss, but Robert Morris showed that
they are a good team.”

Pitt's record is now 8-4-1. Their
next game is tomorrow afternoon at
St. John's. ”That’s another tough Big
East game,” said Luxbacher. ”We’ll
have to make some Changes, hopeful-
ly we will be ready."
