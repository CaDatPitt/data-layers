Students who use Planned Parent-
hood services have a lot at stake when
it comes to nextyear’s federal budget,
which could include signiﬁcant cuts in
ﬁmding for govemment-subsidized
sexual health services.

The Republican—controlled House
of Representatives has already ap-
proved abudgetbillforﬁscalyearzolz
that would reduce spending by more
than $60 billion and cut ﬁmdingfora
number ofDemocrat—supported pro-
grams like Planned Parenthood and
ﬁindingfor public broadcasting. Presi-
dent Barack Obama has threatened
to veto the bill, and it is still unclear
what success the dramatically reduced
spending plan will have when it hits
the Democrat—controlled Senate.

Officials from Planned Parenthood
of Western Pennsylvania expressed
concern over the potential cuts -
especially for the 18- to 24-year—olds
who make up 50 percent of the health-
services provider’s patients. Leaders
from both Pitt’s College Republicans
and College Democrats opposed the
cuts, while a student from a pro—life

group supported them.

With the proposed cuts, clinics in
Allegheny County willbe reduced and
services will no longer be offered at
their current prices, said Rebecca Ca-
vanaugh, aspokeswoman for Planned

Parenthood ofWestem Pennsylvania. _.
' Theorganizat:ion’sservices-includeac-

cess to sexual education, birth control,

STI testingandabortions.Inaddition ,

to screenings and treatments, Planned

Parenthood provides contraceptive at '

a discounted rate.

Under SelectHealth, an insurance
company that works with Plarmed
Parenthood and students, Pitt stu-
dents who are insured or uninsured
can apply for coverage that is com-
pletely conﬁdential. With this cov-
erage students can then receive the
preferred type of birth control at a
much discounted rate based on their
income, or in some cases completely
for free. .

In comparison, many of the same
pills canbe purchased for $15 amonth
at Pitt Student Healthfor students who
are uninsured.

In addition, Planned Parenthood
provided free condoms, no questions
asked, as well as over—the—co_unter

emergency contraceptives at $25-

which can cost up to $35 if purchased
from a regular pharmacy.
The federal budget plan would

eliminate Title X ofthe Public Health
Service Act, which provides family
planning for low income individuals.
In 2010, the act dedicated $317,491
millionirifederalfundstofamily-plan-
ning activities — about a quarter of
which went to Planned Parenthood,

according to the U.S. Department of A

Health and Human Services website.
Under law,thatmoney cannotbe used
to fund abortions.

“Students account for the vast
majority of the common ages that

' we provide services for,” Cavanaugh

said. “They will, withoutta doubt, be
affected.”

Proposed by Republican Rep. Mike
Pence of Indiana to reduce federal
spending, the cuts have met Demo-
cratic opposition that argues that the
Planned Parenthood reductions are
a partisan, moral issue rather than a
solution to the budget problem.

“The people who are campaigning
forthis cut claim itis forthe economy,
but it is most deﬁnitely an ideological
attack,” Cavanaugh said.

Pence is widely known for his anti-
abortion stance, which has made him
afavorite among social conservatives.
He has defended the suggested cuts by
linking Plarmed Parenthood to abor-
tion, suggesting government ﬁmding
would be better spent on HIV testing

An article in yesterday’s paper, “Football woes lead to policy change,” incorrectly described the length of time between the release of the Sports Illustrated/CBS
 - News investigation about college football and crime and former Pitt football player Fernando Diaz’s arrest. The story from Sports Illustrated/CBS News ran for

the rstie ednesda Di s ested on Satura . Th itt Nes e - ets the .

and sexual education. ‘
But the cuts didn’t divide Pitt stu-
dents on ideological lines. The leaders
ofboth the Pit College Democrats and
the Pitt College Republicans agreed
that the cuts aren’t the right way to
go.

lege Democrats, agreed that the cuts
are likely based on partisan beliefs,
rather than practical budget modi-
ﬁcation. .- '

“It seems like a mass budget cut
based on partisanship, and I would
be Very surprised if a member of our

" organization would support it,” Di-

Fiore said.
Pitt College Republicans president

Matthew Vermeire said the cuts are_

counterintuitive.
, “cuttingftmdingforpreventative

A measures will lead to the exact actions

social conservatives say they are trying
to prevent,” Vermeire said. “Although
abstinence is the only way to prevent
pregnancy, it is irresponsible for the
government to make it harder for
couples, especially college students,
to prevent unwanted pregnancies.”
Other students ﬁnd the cuts to be
a positive step towards eliminating
the use of abortions inthe U.S. Senior
Kristin Gottron, amember of campus
pro—life student group Students for

MattDiFiore,presidentofPittCol- '

      

Life, is one.
“It is very good news that the

i House of Representatives has voted

to stop usingourtax dollars to support

' Plarmed Parenthood,” Gottron said.

Gottron said she believes the gov-
ernmer_lt’s support ofPlanned Parent-
hoodis unjustiﬁed because the non-
proﬁt supports the use of abortion
and abortifacients —— substances that
induce abortions— and not just inar-
guably necessary medical care.

“The problemwith equatingabor-
tion to other health care procedures
like cancer and STD screening is that

abortion is not health care,” Gottron
said. “Whereas health care helps to
prolong the life of a patient, abortion
actually ends a life which is growing
within amother.” A

Regardless of the nature ofthe pro-
posedcuts, many students on Pitt’s
campus expressed their belief that
reducing ﬁmding to Planned Parent-
hood would be a mistake.

Pitt freshman Peter Webb said
that the abortion argument should

not be at the forefront of the budget _

process. _
“If you are looking at the cuts in

terms of pushing an idea through

and not just as balancing the budget, I

wouldnotsupporttheproposedcu ,” s

Webb said. I

Pitt’s advice: Be careful about Water, wear sunscreen

Spring break< 1
year, more than 2,500 Americans are
arrested abroad, The Department
of State’s website says, nearly half of
them being for drug charges.

The state department’s website
includes a number of other recom-

mendations for Mexico. It also says,

that f‘U.S. Embassy are prohibited
from hailing taxis on the street in
Mexico City because of frequent rob-
beries. American citizens are urged
to only use taxis associated with the
organizedtaxi stands (“sitios”) that

are common throughout Mexico.”

Keeping safe on spring break
doesn’t just involve being alert at
night. The daytime can hold its fair
share of snags. Sun poisoning can
be a big problem for sun—starved
Pitt students, said Sara Radakovich,
a member of PantherWELL.

The ﬁrst beam of sunlight might‘

tempt some tostrip down to their
swimsuits and bake under the sun,
but the stronger sun inthe tropics can
burn the over-eager. Sun-poisoning

_ from overexposure results in large

burns accompanied by nausea and
disorientation, she said.
Radakovich, a senior studying
Health Service Management, said
students should buy higher-SPF
sunscreen, reapply it every couple
hours and drink plenty of water to

_ help prevent sun poisoning.

Taking frequent breaks from the
sun, especially in rnid—day when it
is strongest, can help prevent sick-

-ness. However, if students do end up

burned, Radakovich said they should
take a cool shower and hydrate. Avoid

oily lotions which can trap heat in p

the skin and worsen burns. Instead,
to soothe, she said students should
learn to “love their “aloe.”

Yakscoe said that preparation and
research are the best defenses against
anunpleasant spring break experi-
ence. Just as many students check
ahead to make sure .their resort has
at least a dozen pools, many should
make sure that their hotels are repu-

table and in a good neighborhood.
Yakscoe said that he thoroughly

researched the resort he’s staying at

and read reviews online before he

signed on to make sure he was com-

fortable with its security. Pooler out-
sourced the inspection to, “a family

A down there who OK’d the hotel and

said where we were stayingwas com-
pletely safe.” g

If nothing else, Yakscoe advised
that students, “stay informed, stay
hydrated” —— with water. i

EDITORIAL

Pitt should go  
gender neutral

Bandwagons get a bad rap. Liter-

ary devices and cultural sages often ‘

advise youto hesitate before joining
the hottesttrend. Although it’s true
that certain bandwagon—jumping
has historically led to devastating
consequences —— think: subprime
mortgage agreements in 2005 —-
popularity shouldn’t always prompt
suspicion.

This is especially true when it
comes to gender-neutral housing,
or allowing students of different
sexes and gender identities to live
together on campus. Each year sees
another bundle of major universi-
ties warming up to the idea, and
gender—neutral housing might not
be the bandwagon for Pitt to shy
away from.

Joining many other institu-
tions across the country, Rutgers
University, the largest institution
of higher education in Newjersey,
armounced this week that it will
offer gender—neutral housing in
three on—campus residence halls
nextfall, according to the Rutgers
student newspaper the Daily Tar-
gum.

As part of the pilot program,
students will be able to live in the
selected dorms regardless of the
gender of the parties involved, as
longas they choose speciﬁc room-
mates, the article reports. The
Targum quoted executive direc-
tor of residence life Joan Carbone
as saying that the measure could
eliminate potential fear among
LGB'I‘ st11dentsthatthey’dbeplaced
with roommates who don’t accept
them.

Ifthe program proves success-
ful, Rutgers will joinahostof other
U.S. colleges — “hundreds,” ac-
cording to the Targum article —
that have recently allowed some
form of gender—neutral housing.
The list includes Dartmouth Col-
lege, the University of Chicago, the
University of Pennsylvania, Bran-

deis University, the University of
SouthernMaineand, mostrecently,
George Washington University.

Accordingto Pitt’s RainbowAl-

liance,Pitthasnotyete2<perienceda

gender—neutral housing, let alone
substantial public debate over the
issue. But in light of Rutgers and
others adopting new policies, the
issue could quickly hit our campus.
Ifit does, we of course wantto hope
for the right outcome.

Pitt should go gender—neutral.

We’re not trying to inﬂame or
disrupt. We’re only trying to help
Pitt students. Since the latter task
happens also to be included in
Residence Lif'e’s job description,we
hope director Shawn Brooks agrees
withus about gender—neutral hous-
ing. Brooks’ ofﬁce directed ques-
tions to University spokespeople,
who did not provide answers after
receiving several calls and e-mails
over the course of two days.

The prospect oflettingmen and
women dorm togethermightseem
radical, but in practice it’s nothing
to be afraid of. Denise Nelson, di-
rector ofResidence Life atthe Uni-
versity of Southern Maine, agrees.
After having years to evaluate the
broad gender—neutral housingpro—
graminauguratedin2004, Nelson
said, “It’s a none-issue for us. It’s
not a big deal for anybody.”

Moreover, a gender—neutral
housing program gives students
a more accurate taste of reality.
With USM’s new policy, “we were
ﬁnally providing an option that
students were having off campus,
on campus. Landlords don’t care,
why should we?” Nelson said.

But more importantly, mak-
ing Pitt’s housing policy gender-
neutral would improve students’
lives.]ames Weaver, the president
of Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, said a
revised housing policy would not
just help LGB’I‘ students: “It really
justbeneﬁts preuy much everyone,
because it gives themthe optionto
livewith people they knowtheycan
get along with.”

If the University ﬁnds stu-
dents with relevant needs down
the road, perhaps gender—neutral
housing could at least be piloted
in select dorms, a la Rutgers. If
implemented, we doubt this will
be a bandwagon Pitt would want
to jump off. I

' There is a distinct difference be-

tween being green and being“green.”
Green practices are hereby deﬁned
as actions that reduce the amount

measurable terms, thereby curb-
ing the waste of energy and natural
resources. “Green” products and
practices, however, are inherently
misleading, designed and utilized by
corporations and smallerbusinesses

alike. They manipulate a “conscien— ‘

tious” consumer into believing he is
helping the environment — even the

business itselfmay be unaware of the

insigniﬁcance of its “efforts.” So I’d
like to dispel a few common myths
that I’ve run into sincethe word
“green” entered my vocabulary.

1) Reusable bags are totally awe-
some! 

Not necessarily. Many compa-
nies use reusable bags in an effort
to simply appear as though they and
their consumers are bettering the
planet — they’re a form of free ad-
vertisement and good publicity. Are

you comfortable walking into Whole
Foods with your TraderJoe’s bag or

I know this is un—American-, but try
buying what you need for the week,
not what you -need for the month.

2) These biodegradable bags are

of the college sort, have an inkling of
concern abouttheir environment and
are able to second-guess advertise-

T ments and the validity of anything

one might just read on a label. If you
want to go from “green” to green, just
step up your game. Avoid greenwash-
ers’ games. Is that product really “all

actually mean anything? Don’t just
buy a reusable bag to have a reusable

practical. If you buy organic, make

into the hype. You don’t have to trash
your cotton wardrobe for a sustain-
able set of1OO percent organic T-

is still a cigarette, an eco-bottle is
still a bottle. I hearken back to the

Much has been made of puberty, a
magical period that occurs some
time during high school. Those
of you who can grow convincing

facial hair know all about it, and 7

‘the rest ofyou have at least heard
of it because it’s on television so
much. What you probably don’t
know anything about, though,
are the equallylmagical changes
that will take place during your
college years. Since we’re getting
paid the big bucks to serve up
heaping helpings of USDA Choice
advice, you’re in store for a hard
dose of the straight dope.

Laziness. Everything gets bet-
ter with time, and your ability to
sit around doing nothing is no
exception to that rule". Whether
you’re transﬁxed by the thrill-
ing comeback of heroic Eagles

comatose following the consump-
tion of too many $5 pizzas, there’s
always a good reason to put off
until some indeterminate point
in the futurewhat you should
have done two or three years ago.
By the time you’re a seventh-year
senior without a medical redshirt
or other compelling reason to
justify your delayed graduation,.
your laziness skills will be second

Hair loss. Remember those
commercials for hair restoration
products that used to amuse you
and your junior high friends?
“Ha ha ha, look at those silly
bald men, clinging desperately
to their fading youth,” you might
have said as you ran your ﬁngers
through your thick, lustrous

dreadlocks. Well, it’s now ﬁve or

which has receded further than

Learning. In addition to
student-loan debt, you accumu-
late an enormous storehouseof

graduate career. Most of this

unlikely that you had the kind of
amazing tolerance you do today.
Drinking in college is a commit-
ment that requires tremendous
focus. Do you know how difﬁcult
it is to wake up at noon, drink a
bottle of wine to kill the hangover
and then spend the rest of the day
working through two more cases

in high school, but college is the
place where you reinvent yourself
and win the girl or guy of your
dreams. After hitting the gym
for some “hardgaining” and the
library to brush up on that fool- v
proof “Mystery” dating method-
ology, you’ll start opening sets
and blazing your own trail of
tears through a long line of un-
suspecting signiﬁcant others. By
the time you graduate, you’ll be
so skilled at “getting some” that
marriage will seem like a refresh-
ing change of pace. Remember
that whatever happens in the Ca-
thedral of Learning stays in the
Cathedral of Learning — and not
just because that iconic building

is so hard to clean!

Jobs. Back in the old days,
when this economy wasn’t so
bad, people sometimes ﬁnished
college and startedworking real
jobs. Those of you who study
nursing and engineering might
still know what we.’re talking
about, but it’s a jungle out there
for everyone else. According to
something we might have seen on
the Internet, there’s a job opening
somewhere in Kansas. Even if you
don’t know much about Kansas,
you might consider checking it
out. Fun fact about Kansas: Pizza
Hut was founded there.

Growth spurts. Think your
only growth spurt occurs in
high school? Wrong times inﬁn-
ity, friends! Owing to the miracle
of elastic waistband technology
and the widespread availabil-
ity of $5 pizza, you’ll spend the
next ﬁve years expanding hori-
zontally. Luckily, the lax dress
code that prevails here at college
will enable you‘ to cloak that new
adipose under a soft coating of
hoodies and loose T—shirts.

N o matter how you cut it,
college will be one of the most
important periods in the life
of anyone who goes to college.
You will undergo many fabulous
changes while making thousands
of Facebook friends and possibly
even a few real ones. The stories
you will be able tell your children
are priceless — because, when
you think about it, how could you
possibly put a price on the un-
folding saga of Pitt football?

Ballet celebrates colorful Hispanic culture

Courtesy Rosalie 0’Connor

Ballet Hispanico will champion Latin American heritage through three acts — “Tres Cantos,” “Mad’moiselle” and “Club Havana” — in its upcoming performance.

Liz Keeney
Staﬁ’ Writer

Ballet Hispanico
Saturday at 8 p.m.
Byham Theater

$23.50 if purchased
through Pitt Arts by
noon, otherwise $19.75-
$45.75 ‘

The growing influence of Latin
culture in the United States must
not be ignored. At least, that’s
the belief of Ballet Hispanico,
a New York City-based dance
company that aims to show
Pittsburgh —-— and the world —
the many ways in which His-
panic heritage has influenced
the art form.

Since its founding in 1970
by dancer Tina Ramirez, Bal-

let Hispanico has distinguished
itself by fusing elements of clas—
sical and contemporary ballet
with Latin movement and mu-
sic. Its mission statement is to
explore, preserve and celebrate
Latin culture through dance and
to engender a discussion of
the culture’s growing influence
throughout the world.

For its show in Pittsburgh,
Ballet Hispanico will showcase
three different choreographic
works, each one representing a
different facet of Hispanic life
and culture.

The ﬁrst, “Tres Cantos,” is,
as Ballet Hispanico artistic di-
rector Eduardo Vilaro sees it, a
bittersweet celebration of the
culture that has emerged from
the 14th-century Spanish con-
quest of Mexico.

The second act is
“Mad’moiselle,” an Annabelle
Lopez Ochoa—choreographed
piece that examines feminin-

ity in Latin culture through the
character of Maria, meant to
represent various important
women in Latin culture. The act
probes both the sacred and the
profane elements of these iconic
figures and how they represent
Hispanic women as a whole.
“It includes the whole com-
pany, and it’s a very contem-
porary piece. It explores the
idea of ‘Maria’ and the different
roles and characters of ‘Maria’
in Hispanic culture,” said com-
pany dancer Lauren Alzamora.

_ “Maria the mother, Maria the

daughter, a friend, even a whore
at certain points, a goddess.”
The third and ﬁnal act is Bal-
let Hispanico’s signaturework,
“Club Havana.” Less narrative-
driven than the first two pieces,

_Club Havana is set in a club in

1940s Cuba and focuses on the
interaction between different
couples. Based in a ballroom,
the balletic—style piece employs

components of the rumba, cha-
cha and mambo interweaved
into the choreography.

“It’s contemporary work that
is accentuated with a Hispanic
flair, because of the music and
the choreographer’s heritage,”
said company dancer Nicholas
Villeneuve.

While Ballet Hispanico’s
primary goals are to preserve
and celebrate Latin dance, an-
other aspect of the company is
to combat stereotypes about
their heritage. V

“You can’t put a culture in
a capsule, you can’t just say,
‘This is it.’ You can’t just say,
‘We wear beautiful white skirts
and we’re always stomping our
feet — there’s much more. And
so it makes it easier with the

-contemporary movement and

concepts to open the imagina-
tion of what ‘Latino’ could be
and what the Latino artist is
thinking today,” Vilaro said.

For Vilaro, Ballet Hispanico
represents a new movement in
contemporary dance — a new
way to celebrate Latin culture
without turning it into a gim-
mick. Instead of relying entire-

_ ly on folklore and traditional

dances stereotypically associ-
ated with the Latin world, the
dancers of Ballet Hispanico try
to find different waysto utilize
Latin dance to show audiences
how their culture permeates the
world around us.

“Latinos today are the fabric
of society, and we made strides
to help change society,” Vilaro
said. “So what we do is add
that contemporary ﬂavor that
opens up dialogue to different
essences of Latino. We have to
represent a new style. Art is a
reflection of the environment,
and if we don’t move along with
our environment, then we stag-
nate and we become just a pretty
picture.” I

MUSIC coLuMN

Wagner: Piaf’s music
permeates film history

Patrick Wagner
' Columnist

While watching the Best Original Scoreportion
of the Academy Awards ceremony this year,
I was pulling for the “The Social Network”
supergroup Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross
for sure, but my heart  with another ﬁlm’s
music all together. Consideringthe movies
from this year, I can’t helpbut think of the how

iwonderfully Edith Piaf’§erﬁotive music from

moirethan half a. century ago worked in Chris-
topher Nolan’s moderncepic “Inception.”
V Piaf, an icon in her native France for the
past 70 years, has created auditory wonders
that transcend one tongue and deliver the
experiences of the proletariat life she knew
to every part of the world. '

Piaf’s music is hard to deﬁne but rests

comfortably between the American jazz of the I

19305 and ’40s, cabaret music — think of what
probably influenced the Dresden Dolls — and
the folk music of France. Her lyrics, exclusively

V in French, cover love and othertopics from a
working-class perspective that in many a

ways, deﬁning of Piaf’s persona a:nd,life. A
7 Though we know she was born into poverty

on. Dec. 19,1915, much of the rest of Piaf’s 
’ early life is still shrouded in mystery. Various 5 I
stories tell of her being abandoned as a-child, ‘

raised by a brothel—owning grandmotherand
overcomingnumerous other hardships before
she began a professional singing career in
1935 to ‘almost immediate fanfare. Her stage
last name of Piaf (“sparrow”) was given to
her at this time as a descriptor of her initial
nervousness and small stature — she was less
than 5 feet tall.

During World War II, she performed for

‘ the occupying Germans but was anything but

a collaboratorintheir cause. Piaf assisted the
French Resistance, wrote a subtle song of pro-
test and personally helped Jewish composer
Michael Elmer escape persecution. From after
the war until her death in 1963, she continued
to be celebrated as a living icon of Paris and
particularly of society’s downtrodden.

Piaf ’s music is remarkably accessible, even
to the point that she appeared on American
television during the end of hercareer. Look-
ing through YouTube and watching her recite
an English-language lyrical summary before
launching into “Milord” is just captivating.

If there is such a thing as a reserved diva,
Piaf might have been it. Her hands on her
stomach, she sings the tale of a jealous woman
with such strength it’s hard to believe that
it could be anything but autobiographical.
When the song ﬁnishes on an exaggerated
loud—soft dynamic she booms along with her

orchestra. ,
That same strength is reﬂected in “Non,_]e
Ne Regrette Rien,” which is her song featured
in “Inception.” The soft ballad cascades likea
living dream through the characters’ illusions

of reality, but this isn’t her only presence on v
, the soundtrack. According to score composer

Hans Zimmer, her songs were interpolated
throughout the score.

‘No, they’re not included in the bassy brass V

hit from the trailers, but through parts of the
score, such as in “Half-Remembered Dream,”
the songstress’s melodies seem to dvlrell just

outside Zimmer’s mind -~ listen for the piano '
p and brass melody. ” —

This isn’t the ﬁrst time a ﬁlmmaker has
used Piaf’s music. The enclof Steven Spielberg’s
“Saving Private Ryan,” for example, features
a scene in -which one of Piaf’s phonograph
records plays prominently in the background
—— one of many times her music has been fea-
tured in cinema. _ ’ ‘ .

A ﬁlm about her extraordinary life was
made in 2007 titled “La Vie en.Rose” after

her signature 1946 song. It starred Marion V] .
~ ' Cotillard, who would, interestingly, go on to _  V ‘

 es‘ 4” °“

play Mal. Cobb ‘in “Inception.” _
. I have to admit I’d-heard of Piafbefore,“In—

iception” brought her back to the limelight.

A year or so ago I saw Martha Wainwright,
sister of Rufus Wainwright,‘ on- “Late Night

with Jimmy Fallon” performing Piaf’s 1944 a‘
song “C’est Toujours la Méme Histoire” with '

a rare power.

Wainwright’s voice sang the ‘silky French
tones differently than Piaf’s madcap vibrato,
adapting rather than imitating the legend’s
song. Andin contrast to the lush orchestral ar-
rangements that often accompany Piaf’s songs,
Wainwright’s small ensemble of guitar, clari-
net, piano and bass made that New York studio
sound like an intimate Paris nightclub.

Compared to the usual fair of hip—hop and
indie rock on “Late Night,” this was some-

thing drastically different. As soon as that.

video went off the Internet, I hunted down
the superb Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, ci Paris:
Martha Wainwright’s PiafRecord, which she
was promoting on the show.

A bit more lush in the instrumentation
than on “Late Night,” the album presents a
wonderful live experience that I only wish I
could have seen in person. While each musi-
cian strums, bows, strikes or blows into their
instrument with unabashed tenacity, Wain-
wright internalizes Piaf’s words and seems
to move with each.

“The Social Network” might have won the ’

Oscar, but the music of Edith Piaf — in the
movies or otherwise —- has won the hearts of
people the world over, even those who don’t
speak French. I '

"MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Pitt can earn Big
East crown on
Senior Night

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball team has been
searching all season for the ultimate
Big East bragging rights — the con-
ference title.

’" For better or worse — that

search is about to end.

With one game remaining in
conference play, the No. 5 Panthers
will look to clinch the Big East sea-
son championship with a victory
over No. 19 Villanova on Saturday
at the Petersen Events Center.

But Pitt" seniors Brad Wanamak-
er, Gilbert Brown, Gary McGhee
and Nick Rivers embrace the chal-
lenge posed to them in their ﬁnal
home game.

"* “It’s coming down to the last
game on Saturday,” McGhee said
in a news conference. “I’m excited
for it. It’s a bittersweet feeling but
I’m ready to go.”

Not only would a victory guar-
antee the Panthers (26-4, 14-3 Big
East) a double—round bye and the
No. 1 seed in the Big East tourna-
ment next week, but Pitt would al-
most be guaranteed to receive a No.
1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

.5 “This would be our ﬁrst Big East
firegular season title [in ﬁve years]
that we didn’t share if we win this
game on Saturday,” Brown said. “I
think it’s playing in our minds too
that we don’t want to share any-
thing, we want to be the outright
-achampions.”

The Panthers hope to pick up a
win against a ranked Villanova team
before heading into the postseason,
after losing to two ranked oppo-
nents in the past two weeks (No. 16

."Louisville and No. 15 St. John’s).

But Villanova (21-9, 9-8 Big
East), has had trouble recently.
After starting the season 16-1 and
vaulting into the top 10, the Wild-
cats have gone 5-8 since Jan. 17,
including a blowout loss to No. 7

“-*Notre Dame by 29 points on Mon-
day. A

Despite that, the Panthers know
they have to be ready to face Vil-

lanova in a league that has proven to
be one of the toughest in the history
of college basketball.

‘.‘When we play on that third day
[of the Big East Tournament] we’re
going to be playing a team that’s
going to probably be seeded higher
in the Big East Tournament than
they would be in the NCAA Tourna-
ment,” Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
said. “There’s nothing to compare
it to. It hasn’t happened before and
it won’t happen again.”

With typically strong contribu-
tions from guards Corey Stokes,
Mallik Wayns and Corey Fisher,
Villanova’s recent troubles on the
court have been unexpected.

Fisher, the team’s leading scorer
at 15 points per game, excels at get-
ting to the basket and creating op-
portunities for himself and others
off the drive. But Notre Dame cut
off Fisher’s lanes to the basket and
forced him to settle for contested

jumpers in the team’s most recent
loss. _

An ankle injury to Stokes forced
him to miss the Wildcats’ Feb. 12
game against Pitt when the Panthers
left Philadelphia with a 57-54 win
without the services of their own
leading scorer, Ashton Gibbs.

Gibbs leads the Panthers in scor-
ing coming into, the game, averag-
ing 16.3 points per game, whereas
seniors Wanamaker and Brown
rank right behind him at 12.2 and
11.1 points per game, respectively.

McGhee is the team’s leading
rebounder, averaging 7.8 boards
per game, and will look to exploit
Villanova’s lack of depth and size
on the interior. .

Not only does Pitt want to keep
’Nova at bay to earn a No. 1 seed in
the Big East Tournament, but head
coach Jamie Dixon and the rest of

the Panthers want to send their .

seniors out on a high note in their
ﬁnal home game. i 1 l

“I think that would be the most
memorable moment [of my Pitt
career] ,” McGhee said. “Winning
a ﬁnal home game and getting a Big
East championship at home, that
would mean a lot to me.”  ~

Panthers ready for EWL  
tournament    

‘Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

The ‘Pitt wrestling team has
reached several milestones over
the past two years —- it earned
consecutive dual meet titles over
Edinboro, two wrestlers reached
the 100—w"1n mark and one be-
came an All-American.

This weekend, it will attempt
to add another title tolits list —
the teamwill compete in its ﬁrst

Eastern Wrestling League indi-
vidual tournament, the biggest
match—up of the season.

“We want the dual meet title,”
redshirt junior Tyler Nauman
said several weeks ago. “But we
also want the EWL tournament
title too because we’ve never had
that before.”

The tournament title will not
be an easy victory for the Pan-
thers. They will have to arrive
in Bloomsburg ready to wrestle
at their top level to compete

with individuals from Clarion,
Cleveland State, West Virginia,
Lock Haven, Bloomsburg and
Edinboro.

Last season, the Panthers
placed second in the individual
tournament behind the Edinboro
Fighting Scots.

And like last season, the Pan-
thers defeated the Fighting Scots
for the dual meet title, so they
hope to take that momentum into
the individual tournament.

Pitt facing tough

Wrestling 4 I8"

Adding to the excitement is the fact
that the Panthers will welcome back junior
Zac Thomusseit, still ranked No. 5 in the
nation after being sidelined since Dec. 29
with an injury. ' . I _‘ V

“I think it should really be big to get
Zac back,” assistant coach Jason Peters
said. “It changes a lot of things for us. Zac
is the type of guy that can turn a dogﬁght
into an easywin. He’ll really "make a dif-
ference for us.”

So far this season, the Panthers have
proven they have the most complete team,
without any real weakwpoint in the lineup.
The team stacks up well in the individual
stou'rnarnent' as well, as alllo wrestlers
havea legitimate shot at placing in the top-

three of their respective weight classes, '

to qualify for the NCAA Championships
in Philadelphia later this month.

“We’d love to get all 10 of our guys to
NC_AAs in Philadelphia,” head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “It’s a good conference.
It_»’s not going to be easy butl think we’re
in the hunt at every weight class.” v

At the lightest weight class, 125 pounds,
the Panthers have a title contender in
sophomore Anthony Zanetta. Zanetta won

thegtournament as a freshman at the same‘

weight class. His roadto Philadelphia will
likely go through Shane Young of West
Virginia. Zanetta defeated Young 5-3 ear-
lier in the year. ‘ . I

Other top competitors are Sean Boylan I

of Bloomsburg and Nick Hyatt of Lock
Haven. . * - ‘  '

“Zanetta isn’t defending anything,”
Stottlemyer said. “He’s in the hunt for that
title. Sometimes it’s hard to be a sopho-
more. We really think that Zanetta has
ﬁgured out how to be in that role.”

At 133 pounds, freshman Shelton Mack
hopes to make his first EWL tournament
a memorable one. Other top wrestlers
at his weight are John Trumbetti of Lock
Haven, Eric Morrill of Edinboro, and Nate

Pennesi of West Virginia. Trumbetti won_

the 133 pound class last year.

“Shelton is a guy that never won a
match at the PIAA state tournament when
he was in high school,” Stottlemyer said,
referring to Pennsylvania’s high school

league. “He’s in the ‘hunt now, and we hope

that he can make a run.” ,

At 141 pounds, the Panthers have Nau-
man poised to win his third consecutive
EWL title at that weight. Nauman enters
ranked No.8'in the nation in his weight

' class.

At 165 pounds, redshirt junior Ethan
Headlee hopes to make his first run at
an EWL title. Headlee’s experience could
very well set him apart from the compe-
titionlafter an up—and-down season at

’ two different weight classes. Headlee is

road in postseason

second on the team with 24 wins on the
season. Headlee has lost two matches in
the EWL by only one point each to Donald
Jones of West Virginia and Rob Michels of
Cleveland State. '

“Ethan is a veteran,”~Stottlemyer said. '

“He knows what it’s all about. I have a lot
of conﬁdence in Ethan.”

At 174 pounds, the Panthers had to
make a decision about who was going to
get the nod to wrestle. The coaching staff
selected junior Karl DeCiantis to wrestle
at the tournamentafter Headlee, Andy
Vaughan and Adam Counterman also
wrestled matches at.174 pounds.  

“We decided to go/Lwith Karl De°Ciantis,”
Stottlemyer said.“‘He can be a danger-
ous guy. He’s only wrestled 12 matches
this season but we thought he deserved
the opportunity. I’m sure he’s excited and
ready to go.”

At 197, pounds Thomusseit will return
to the lineup in the hunt for the title.
Thomusseit was the tournament cham-
pion at 184 pounds last season. Top com-
petitors with Thomusseit will be Shawn

Fendone of Edinboro and West Virginia’s 4

Kyle Rooney. During the season, senior
ﬁll-in Phil ;Sorrentino droppeda tough
1-omatch, to Fendone. Rooney wrestled

at heavyweight and was pinned_du_ring the
I season against the Panthers. 0 l -

“Zac is backin therlineup and we’re
happy to have him back,” Stottlemyer said.
He’s a top-10 guy so it means a lot. Phil
[Sorrentino] did a great job ﬁlling in. He
created momentum for us. The bottom
line is that Thomusseit can get hischand
raised. He’s deﬁnitely anxious to be back
and ready to go.”

At heavyweight, Tomei looks to repeat
as tournament champion after winning by
fall in the ﬁnals last season on his way to
being named the tournament’s Outstand-
ing Wrestler.

“Ryan will be at it,” Stottlemyer said.
“He’s a very consistent guy so we hope to
see big things out of him.”

Tomei thinks he is ready to make an-
other run at the heavyweight title this time
around as well. .

“You know right now I'feel thebest
I’ve felt since I’ve been here,” Tomei said.

‘ “I have no soreness and no pain. It feels

good to come in and workout. I feel ready
to go.”
Every Panther in the lineup will have a
