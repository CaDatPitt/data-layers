CANDLEBEARERS SOLEMNLY processed across the Cathedral layvn Tues-

   

day night in a silent protest against the War in Vietnam and injustices in

America.

by ELLEN GANLEY
Night Editor

 The steps of Soldiers and Sail-

ors Memorial was the-site of the
pre-Moratorium rally on Tues-
evening. featuring John

€11.

. Froines presently under indict-
tment for his portion in the May
demonstrations asserted that
"the people of Viet Nam are be-

 _ ing Americanized instead of Viet-

namized. Because of the indis-
criminate attacks on peasants in
‘the countryside. the people are
forced to move to the cities. This
'isi'breaking_up the family struc-
ture-in the villages. When the peo-
ple get to the cities. they find that
the war has gone to the cities."

Froines also spoke about the At-
tica prison tragedy. As a member
of an observer group at the be-
seiged prison. he said that he saw
great unity among the black.
white and Puerto Rican prisoners.

 "After it was all over." Froines

said. "Rockefeller made the vic-
tims the oppressors. He said the
prisoners‘ were making -spears.
« knives. and digging trenches.
Well. of course, they were! They
had to with 1.000 National Guards.
hundreds of state troopers and po-
lice helicopters breathing down

° . theirnecks.“

Concerning the present peace
movement. Fr-oines stated that

‘more “humility must be exhibit-
. ed by the protesters. The day of

demonstration is over. We have

V-{Z-to get down to local strategies and
,9 H appeal to the people."-

Also speaking was John Birch,
Tregional coordinator of the Viet

-.Nam Veterans Against the War

(VVAW). He stated that he was
calling for a national action.

“Thanksgiving is coming up."
he said. "and most of America
will spend the day eating turkey
_ dinners. and watching football
ganies in front of their 'I‘Vs. On
this day. napalm will still be drop-
ped on Viet Nani. I'm sure only a
few oi you have seen what iiaplam

he had suffered "econoinically.

He accused the government of
being the -real criminal ‘for put-

The purpose of the .\'Ioratori-
um I which featured the rock group
"Gravel." along with thespeak-
ers. was to urge an end to the War
in Vietnam and a reordering of na-
tional priorities. _~
During the day. several speak-
ers offered solutions to what they
termed social dilemmas.

Jim Ferlo, co-ordinator for the
Pittsburgh Coalition for Peace
and Justice (PCJPNP), pinch-
hitted for.Naside Henderson of the
Angela Davis Task Fierce, who
was unable to attend. —

Ferlo argued that “the recent
events in Attica and the murder
of George Jackson at San Quen-

tin make all the more clear‘ the

need for immediate reasonable
bail pending Angela Davis‘ trial."

Shirley Schultz of the-Women's .

Center. said that the rally was not
important. ."in and of itself."ibut.

“If we have one basic goal.”

.said Goldberg. "it is to try and‘

 to be.”

If you close your eyes and
let your mind wander, you can

‘imagine those same words from
1 the mouth of Millett, Morgan,

But the Pussycats’ seem to be

  reacting almost as much to the

"We thought\ ‘Here is this

kind of feminism, is blowing
the byline we all worked so hard
to get." We thought this had in-
truded into our lives/far enough."

‘ Shortly thereafter, Goldberg
and Jeannie Sakol organized the
Pussycats. The group now claims
10,000 members and branches
in Boston, Miami. Chicago. New
York, and Washington. D.C.

Despite the relative proximity
of the Feminists and Pussycats
on certain issues, Goldberg does
not expect a rapproachment in
the foreseeable future.

“I don’t think it will happen.
because at the core of Women's
‘Lib is this hatred of being fe-

The office must know

“break-even", basis. Vrana ex-
plained that the office receives
no revenues other than the stu-
dents‘ fees. Therefore. to predict
its expected revenue. he said, it
must charge the flat. dorm rate
of $650 for room and board per
student.

;~-'=::.iu.‘;t‘:l

If .students were given the op-
tion of not buying tmeal tickets,
Vrana said, the office’ would be
forced -to charge more for living
in theldorms.

Vranaisaid that the optional
meal ticket system has been
tried at other" schools without
success; students asked to be
returned to the mandatory plan.

The Housing Director stated
that the meal ticket is actually

‘less expensive than buying meals

separately. It provides three
meals a ‘day with unlimited
seconds for an approximate cost
of $2.87. T

There.is one option for some
dormitory students. Student
nurses can purchase a meal tick-

is a perennial question -

in ad-

et for_16 meals per week, rather
than for the normal 21.

In addition commuters have
the options of buying luncheon
tickets at the-cost of $8(l.()t) per
term and dinner tickets for $170
per term. 'l'hese tickets may be
purchased at the 'l‘owers desk at
uiiy time duiing the term. since
they are prorated.

Prcseittly. 150 commuters take
advantage of these options.

Several student-staff commit-_
teesarepresently examining dif-
ferent meal plans._ Possibilities
being considered are a lunch/
dinner plan and a Monday through
Friday meal plan.

Vrana also noted the imprac-
ticality of installing cooking
facilities in the dorms. Because
the University would provide no
subsidy. he said. the ‘cost would
be charged‘ to the

relied upon by the members of
the Cabinet." he added. ' 0

According to Athletic Depart-
ment Business Manager , Ken-
neth George, the decision to

,limit the number of" tickets was

based on “past experience.”
George noted that the Cabinet
had sold 66 tickets for the first
game, and 100 for the second.
“Therefore, we are prepared to
provide 100-200' tickets for the
Notre Dame game,” he said.

’l‘he logic behind this policy.
George explained, is that "any

  

 
   
   
   
 

you have in mind,

      
     

tickets sold to these part-time _

‘students istaking away from

full-time students."

Student Cabinet -Chairman
Gordon Percy pointed out, how-
ever, that full-time students do
not purchase tickets; they merely
present their ID’s at the gate. He
further noted that the seats sold
to General Studies part-time
students were located in Sec-
tion 11. rather than the student
section——although. once admitted,
these students havethe privilege
of being admitted to the student
section if they so desire.

“As far. as I’m concerned, from 4

the very beginning the Athletic
Department: hasn’t negotiated

“with us in good faith,” stated

Percy. “They’re quite willing to
sell us seats for students when
they. can’t sell them to anyone
else.” -

Giovacchini ‘said that "phone
calls will be made. letters will
be sent—and. if necessary, pos-
sible injunctive relief will be
sought.“  -

Ives Devotees Savor
  All-American Treat

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

The University‘s celebration of
Thoreau Week has certainly been
a festive one, especially the music
departments tribute to that in-
domitable Concordian in an all-
Ives concert Tuesday.

Although Charles Ives‘ name
has yet to be-addedto that all-
American triumvirate of “mom.
apple pie. and the girl left be-
hind." we all knew on Tuesday
evening that we were witnessing
"Americana" at its finest.

The program opened with the A

very appropriate song Thoreau,
sung by Julia Lerner. mezzo-_so-
prano. Next came On the Anti-
podes, a madhouse of sound for
two pianists. two sopranos and
one organist. Ives‘ lyrics brought
as many chuckles from the audi-
ence as did his music.

Songs based on hymn tunes
were the next feature of the pro-
gram. Before each song, a quartet
sang the respective hymn, ably
accompanied by Norris Stephens.
Especially notable was General

_ William Booth Enters into Heav-

en. (based on the Vachel Lindsay
poem) sung by. Thomas Dean,
bass. Dean’s sound and technique
were most admirable.

Cacophony reigned supreme in

the chamber music piece From
Steeples to the iVIoutai.ns as trom-
bone. t.riinip‘et. piano and bells
minglcd,in a frenzy of sound.

have been a reaction to society of
careless printers.

Monday evening Walter Hard-
ng. an English professor at Gen-
esco. presented an in-depth ana-
ysis of the errors of publication
n Thoreau‘s writing. His lecture
entitled "Betrayal of Thoreau or
Some Case Studies in Editorial
§Problems“ was the second lec-
 ture of Thoreau Week.

"Not a single one of Thoreau's
books has appeared as he wanted
it t-o.'?'Harding said.

"In Walden. Harding explained
that the‘ printer misread Tho-
reau’s handwriting and substi-
tued “lustff for "best” in the sen-

  

Following intermission the first
violin sonata was given a very
fine reading by Mara Dvonch as-

   
   
  
   
    
   
   
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
  

ano. Ives‘ perplexing technique.
one moment terribly Schonbergi-
an, and the next. romantically
lyrical. came to light here.

Tartak, assisted by Bernard
flute, concluded the
program with the Thoreau section
of the second piano sonata. Asits
sounds dissipated into the mists,
a capacity audience showed its
enthusiastic appreciation for an
evening of unusual and exciting
music.

An appreciation of Ives. who is
certainly not a very easy compos-
er to digest upon first hearing.
seems to increase as one looks
more closely at his technique an
his vision.

‘1

Most of his compositions. stuff—_
ed away in his desk for man '
years. have come to light only re-
cently. American culture has cei
tainlybeen enriched by his work"
and we can all brag to the world
that America. so long thought to
be the homeland of borrowed cul-
ture. has prod_uced a truly orig-
inal musical genius.

Thoreau hopes to find a lofti-
ness of intent among the inhabi-
tants of Saddleback mountain as
the altitude increases. but he
meets instead a Circe intent on
combing her hair and knowing the
events of the "lower areas." _

According to Professor Thomas
Philbrick. .Thoreau penned con-
irasting reactions to mountain-
climbing/in two minor narratives.
Thoreaii is overjoyed to find him-

Leonard Bernstein. liiinseli' an
Ives‘ devotee. called him "out"

spirit was certainly a pioneering
one. \\’hat could be more .\meri

Harding added that in Week on

work, there were as many as 1,-

three lines were completely omit-

Cape Cod was one of the-few
books that fared well. said Hard-_
ing. but Thoreau had not finished

editing it before his death. llard-‘

sheets were included by the edi-
tors in the final publication of the
work.

PIRG To Bring Nader Activities To Pitt.

by IIEIDI LEVIN
Developing a new base of pow-
er in the United States to influ-
ence and regulate government and
industry is'the goal of a student

. public interest group now forming
on campus. ' ' '

The-concept of‘ Public Interest

Research Groups (PIRG) was in-

troduced at Pitt by Brent English.
a member of.Ralph' Nader's na-
tional organization. English ex-
plained t-hat PIRG was initiated

‘two years ago in an attempt to ex-

pand Nader-type activities to the

PIRG has been established in Ore-

gon. and others are currently be-

ing established in California and
throughout the Midwest.

PIRG at Pitt would be part of
this national movement. At other
campus, PIRG is funded by a stu-
dent-voted tax, refundable at the
beginning of each term to students
not wishing to offer support.

The funds created are used to
hire a staff of professionals to di-
rect PIR-G-activities. The law-

' yers. economi.sts. biologists. and
scientistshired would berespon-‘

sible to an elected student board
of directors. Field work would be
done by the student staff of PIRG.
assisted by the professionals.

‘English said this organization-

al structure will solve the basic-

problems which have prevented
success in other student organiza-
tions; he identified lack of con-
tinuing expertise and financing as
being the basic problems of the
group. ‘ \

Once organized, the possibilities
for PIRG activities appear broad.
Law suits against industry and
businesses‘ resulting from air and
water pollution, consumer fraud,
and product safety regulations

"are possible. Watch dog activities

are also envisioned,/,directed to-
wards industry as well as govern-
ment. ’

Following the pattern establish-
ed by Ralph Naders activities, all
PIRG actions will be strictly
"within the system."By pressur-
ing for strict enforcement of ex-
isting laws and regulations.‘ as
well as through theinitiation of
new laws. PIRG would hope to
bring about needed. reform‘ and
change. , ”

English identiféd the greatest
obstacle to PIRG’s success
throughout the country as the gen-
eral
student bodies. He pointed out
that the indifferences results
from the frustrations of students
who have been unable to detect
any tangible results of other or-
ganizations which they have work-
ed for.

‘If students can be convinced not
only of thejimportance of PIRG’s
purposes, but also the great pos-
sibilities for its success, English
said, it can develop into a power-

There
are 18 rooms in all and three
committees hope to ‘construct
rooms for Denmark, Finland,
and Israel.»

Each nationality’ room is do-
natedl paid for, and kept up by
the ethnic groups being repre-
sented. " r

’l‘ours of these rooms are con-
ducted by a group of friendly.
qualified Pittstudents who call
themselves Quo Vadis. The group

is voluntary and is composed of . .

63 hostesses and one host. but
they welcome any other males
who may be interested. _

. Quo Vadis shows the rooms to
young students, and handicap-
ped children’ as well  famous
people. Gene Kelly, Astronaut
Frank Bormau and Prime Min-
isters t'rom countries such as
Greece, Ireland, and Japan,
were some of the recent visitors.

Quo ‘Vadis has been trying
to make the students and l’a_cul-
ty aware of the beauty and val-
he of the rooms. Tours were
conducted this fall for classes
who use the»room‘s. and next
term a more extensive plrn will
be put into action. ,

Quo Vadis feels that u the
students are n/iade,ai.vare' of the
value of the rooms tiny vs/,ill.

“Maxine Bruhns, group advis-

The Citizenship. Information
Centerhas begun publishing a bi-
monthly newsletter designed to
alert the University community to
pertinent political happenings.

particularly with regard to the‘

coming elections.

Jane Thompson. director of the
Center. said that "the newsletter
resulted from the efforts of stu—
dent political organizations like
the Democrat and Republican

H ' clubs. plus independents. all of‘

whom want to generatepolitical
interest among the student body.“
"The first issue_of the newslet-
ter contains five items of major
interest." said Thompson.

As Thompson explained it, “CIC
exists to assist in the education of
students for effective political
participation, to serve as a clear-

ing house for information and col-

lection of data, and to facilitate
academic research.” - -

Two "other items are editorials

by President‘ Ron Brown and Vice- '

President Mike Haley ‘of the stu-
dent Democratic and -Republican
clubs. respectively. on their clubs‘
candidates for ‘County Commis-
sioner.. .

Another is a look at the Young
Woman’s Political Caucus. a new
organization on campus. specifi-
cally for women.

The last item is a questionnaire

.wh_ich,_ states Thompson, “is de-

signed to elicit what students
would like to see by way of poli-
tical speakers, rallies and so on.”

Thompson emphasized that CIC
is “non-biased with regards to po-
litical affiliation." '

"CIC will ,not organize rallies
or arrange for candidates to
speak: the political clubs will do
thatf* ' '

."‘CIC willadvertise such rallies
by way of the newsletter, bro-
chures and handouts.”

V As to future issues. Thompson

said that “the newsletter will deal

of Tulane University hosts the in-‘and—out Panther gridiron squad.

Withouta doubt, Pitt is capable of defeating Tulane. But
don’t bet on ‘it. The two cat victories this season have come over
UCLA (29-25) and Navy (36-35). A quick bit of research shows

that the combined record of these two teams is now 2-8. In addi- 2’

tion, the Middies have dropped contests to both Penn State an
Boston College by 52 and 43 points, respectively. 3 -

I said Pitt “is capable of winning.” Coach Carl DePasqu
has seven talented running backs. Has Clair Wilson, an all-state
halfback in 1969, seen any action in the backfield? Why has John
Chatman, who possesses an 82 rushing average, been only used
against Oklahoma and West Virginia as a ball carrier?

Carl DePas-qua is a solid football coach. He is a conserva-
tive tactician, primarily concerned with fundamentals and hard-

nose play. Quarterback Dave Havern, at least statistically, is

one of Pitt's all-time greats. Nevertheless, Coach DePasqua,
‘except for the Navy’ game, has stuck with ‘a three-man rotation
at the field general position. - '

I am one of those sportswriters /who thrives on comparisons
of personnel. Penn State isblessed with two fine quarterbacks
in John Hufnagel and Steve Joachim. There is no shuttling of sig-
nalcallers at University Park. Except for the defensive sec-
ondary and possibly the defensive line, I believe Pitt has more
overall depth than the Nittany legions. Yet. aside from the differ-
ences; in scheduling of opponerns, Pitt should have a squad equal
to that of Penn State—we d0n‘t. '

A glimpse into the immediate and near Panther gridiron fu-
ture appears cloudy, at'best. Should the ‘Cats put it all together
throughout the rest of the season, a‘ 5-5 mark is attainable. Bas-
ed on a more realistic prognosis, 4-7 will be closer to the record.

The Figfhtin’ Irish and Nittany Lions are sure to skin the’:

Cats. Florida State and Syracuse seem to be headed for post-';

‘season bowls. Finally,.the Cadets, BC, and the Green Wave are
certainly on a par with Coach DePasqua’s charges.

. Tllefirst four games have revealed a Pitt offense that is,

more explosive than any other Cat squad since 1963. with the ex-

cep,ti.or_1 of the West Virginia contest. Unfortunately. the 1971

!Panthers lack the needed raging» desire that is essential for a.

successhil season. .

When the fool.ba'l1 team skimsand swears throughlthis arti- _

-cle. the 1971 Tulane-Pitt encounter “will be history. A -Panther‘
triumpla would stem the tide. A

Although their season is still
over a month and a half away. the
1971-72 Pitt basketball team is
already, generating a lot of excite-
ment both around campus and
around the country. There are
more than just optimistic loyal-
ists predicting a post-season tour-
nament for the hoopsters.

Head Coach Buzz Ridl. in his
fourth year as l”itt‘s basketball
incntor is notknown for his rasli
.statemcnts about the ie;un’s
chances for a bid. but ev.en "he
, seemsconfident. '

' commente(l l{idl.'"“We‘re .going
I,  aftrxr it. We hope to be. in a post-
a season tournament." ' ' '

 
  
  

With their personnel, depth and
0.\'pt‘l'lC1l(?e,»_gthC hoopsters are a
good bet to raise a few eyebrows
4 this "season. They have been rank-
‘ V . 1 ed by llasketball Weekly asjthei
A  .  sixth most improved team in the

country- before even playing a

1 game. 1 - . 1 .
 ’I‘he'source of all this optimism
is the fact thatsix of the seven top
scorers from last year's squad re-
turn in addition to a high school
All-Ainerican who didn't play last

 

crga'inst UCLA last year in the Steel Bowl. Harrison and Sulkowski are just
. ‘ . ‘two of the returning lettermen that stud the "71-72 hoopsters.

services of sophomores Mickey
Martin who averaged 20.8 points
per game last year for the fresh-
men. Sam Fleming (11.8). and 6-7
Jim Bolla (12.0).

"We have fine talent but we
mustget. this talent working to-
gether as a team.“ cautioned Ridl.
"We will pr_obabl_y be using eight-
nine players on a rotating basis

and this could mean a lot of ad— 1

justing on the part of the players.

Robertson felt that all the Con-

or scoring from close in.”
