1 . ABOUT_ FRATERNITIES

students’ minds, is about fraternities.

and much space, but the following will

Fraternities may be national or lo-

about national fraternities, if you wish
to know their general standing. Alum-

Ordinarily it is not extremely difﬁ-
‘cult’ to get asked into a fraternity, but
make it the last -thing to do, unless,
absolutely sure of your ground, to ask
‘yourself into one. Here, as a. maxim
on how to get in, we repeat from a
past editorial: “Show all ‘your per-
sonality and’ leadership in a. modest
way before .a,‘fraterni_ty man and the
chances are goodfor your‘ being ask-

. "West Virginia Five win Ap-

_ pea: at Trees Gym for Open-
ing Game‘-——Coach Flint Un-
decided Upon Lineup. . ,

Pitt will" inaugurate" its basketball
season tomorrow f3Ve.I1iVI1g With F1519

West’ Virginia University live as its

opponents. For the opening game this

contest is unusually strong andwill
undoubtedly draw a large crowd of
students as well as alumni and follow-

ersot‘ Pitt’s athletics. .

Last year Pitt defeated West Vir-

‘ glnia in both games", but neither of

them was. a cinch for the Panthers,
and they knew they had been in a. real
game before the timer’s whistle blew.
The Mountaineers are coming here de-
termined to get revenge for these de-

- feats and show Pitt that they have a

real classy‘bu"nch of tossers; _
_ "Wh'a~t the lineup will be Coach Flint
himself does not know and will not

" likely decide __,upon acombination be-

fore; time to. send the team on the
ﬂoor.. Of the 15 candidates ‘any ﬁve

 cou'ld"well represent‘ Pitt on the ﬂoor
- * andmake an exc_ell_ent showing. There
" is a _merry ﬁght on ‘for the positions.

and it will be impossi-ble .for Coach

" Flint to decide on a. ﬁnal" Va:r_si‘t'y ﬁve

until after several games have been
played. and he can see the men per-
form in real contests. Most of the
meniare new and the coach has ‘not
had a ‘chance .to see just what most‘

V’ of themcan do. .Befor_e the game‘ is
'" over it is likely '_t_h-at "all the squad will

‘have seen some actipn, so that it
makes little ‘difference ,who starts.
Any attempt to ‘pick the probable ﬁve
wo‘uld be folly. A captain will prob-
ably be‘ selected within a. short time

V ‘West Virginia ‘Loses Stars

IWest Virginia will come here with
practically the same handicaps as Pitt
-in.,"respect‘to Varsity men lost because
" They played their
‘first game Monday night and will have
that much advantage over Pitt. Rodg-

. V Lers, captain-ellect -of West."Virginia’s

basketball team and‘ recognized "as the

V‘ best all-around athlete produced there
1 in the last few years, willnot be seen-

here, though he..is perfectly‘ eligible,
as he will .be.in school and will be
taking full work; "Last May his studies
jwere interrupted by his departure to
the army, which will,‘ make his sched-
,ule and class work especially difﬁcul-t_
e has decided «to ‘stay

. out of athletics for the present; . "

»I_.atternVer,V captain of last year-’s ﬂoor

- team and -star forward for three years‘,

is-‘in-the same .pred_ica.ment as Rodgers"

“ -Va.n"duw,ill"n_ot take part‘ «thisyear. ~:s‘e.

sides his heavy school work,‘ Latterner
is. doing wor.k*'ifn spare hours for the
State Road Commission and thus feels

. ‘ it-_..best‘to forego basketball. _. The loss
- _’ of these two veterans, whohad been
- counted -’ upon as the nucleus ofthe

'-"ﬂoor team, has been a hard blow -to:
Coach Mullenix, as the experience of
two such men will ‘be missed. One
letter man" of last year, BizV Dawson,
the star guard, is the only veteran
left for-Coach Mellenix, but there is
a_ weV_alth_"ot" material for a good ﬁve
among‘ the new men. V -
This conditionwill make the game
a more evenly matched battle. Inthe
‘recent’  meetings ’ between athletic‘
teams of the two institution-s West

IV -‘Virginia has proven that she is about

as near Pitt's equal. ‘as any otthem,
