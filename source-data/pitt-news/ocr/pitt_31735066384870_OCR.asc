Minority Enrollment at State Colleges Near Federal Goal

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—State educa-
tion officials say Pennsylvania, told
to have minority enrollment up to 10
percent at its 14 state-supported
colleges by 1980, is about two
percentage points from its goal.

Minority enrollment at the
colleges reached 8.1 percent by last
fall, almost double the number
enrolled when federal guidelines
were imposed.

“The state colleges are working
as hard as they can,” Edward
McGuire, state commissioner of
education, said of efforts to recruit
minorities.

Nevertheless, problems still per-

Editor Plans

Greater SGS
Coverage

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staffwriter

Larry Peterson, new editor of the
Night Times, has high hopes for the
biweekly newspaper published by
the ‘ School of General Studies
(SGS). _

Peterson, who was elected to the
post by the SGS Student Cabinet
last week, said “we are going to
concentrate more on SGS students,
their interests and their problems

“There has been some national
news in past issues, and I don’t
think we need more perspectives in
national and international news
since SGS students can get it in
other papers.”

 

Features on SGS organizations 
and profiles on SGS students are the 

two types of stories Peterson plans
to stress in the Night Times. He
wants to lessen the paper’s
reporting of spot news because he
feels it is stale by the time it is
printed in the Night Times.

“We will be covering some spot
news, but we will be late with that so

Peterson believes he has a good
foundation of staff members who
have decidedto remain with the
newspaper under his editorship,
and can add-to the Night Times’
quality.

sist in recruiting minorities.

“The root of the problem has
gone back to high school and the
high drop-out rate and low
attendance of our black children,”
Secretary of Education Caryl Kline
said.

There are no statewide statistics
on blacks leaving high school-or
even graduating.

State education officials also cited
high college tuitions and the
relative isolation of many state
colleges from urban. areas as
obstacles in the way of more rapid
advances in black college enroll-
ments.

Acting in 1974 under a federal

court order, the U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
imposed the 10 percent require-
ment.

However, HEW attorneys note
the figure is a goal, not a quota, and
only a “good faith effort” to reach
the percentage must be shown. In
June,. the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that race may be a factor in
school admissions, but that rigid
quotas may not be set.

The federal guidelines were set a
year after the U.S. District Court in
Washington D.C. found that
Pennsylvania and nine southern
and border states were operating
separate systems of higher educa-

\

tion for blacks and whites.

The court said that Cheyney State
College in Thornbury, Delaware
County, was being maintained as a
black institution, while other
colleges in Pennsylvania were being
kept primarily white.

Should the state be found in
willful non-compliance with the
order in 1980, federal funding to the
state-—or at least to the colleges-
could be halted. ‘

‘‘I’d feel more comfortable with a
little bit higher minority enroll-
ment,” said Conrad Jones, head of
equal opportunity programs in the
state Department of Education.
“But at this rate we’re going to

come very, very close to the 10
percent.”

Cheyney, on the other hand, lags
far behind in its effort to raise white
enrollment to 30 percent, another
1980 goal indicated in the court
order. Last year, white enrollment
was only 15 percent, according to
Cheyney officials.

Wade Wilson, Cheyney presi-
dent, said state-funding for curri-
culum expansion into such areas as
banking and real estate might help
attract more white students.

Pennsylvania is closing the gap
between the percentage of black
college students and the percentage
of the population that is black.

Drinking Bill Lobby to

Meet in Capital Today-

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Representatives from various

‘- student organizations are meeting

at the capital building in Harrisburg

' today to discuss lobby strategy for

the 19-year-old drinking bill, set for
House debate this fall.

meeting was set to begin at one
p.m. this afternoon.

SGB member David Hesidence
termed the meeting “a discussion
of lobbying tactics.”

The bill (SB-252) was passed by
the Senate last June 8th, 26-22, and
is currently in the Liquor Control
Committee of the House.
According to Medoff, the bill has
already had a second “considera-
tion’ ’ on the House ﬂoor and a third
debate in the House sometime this
fall will most likely be followed by a
vote.

“It is going to be a really close
vote,” Medoff said yesterday.
“There area lot of rural districts
where it won’t go over very big.
It has a shot, though.”

A similar bill was defeated by the
House 95-94 in 1973 (102 affirma-

Posvar Hopeful of Pitt-Peking Exchange

1 An exchange program between
Pitt and the Peking Institutue of
Technology could be one of the
by-products of warmer relations
between the United States and
China, according to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar.

“We proposed to them (Peking
ofﬁcials) to send six students here,”
Posvar said in a Pitt News interview
last Friday. The Chinese showed
some interest in the program and he
expected to hear from Peking

fflicials “any day now.” Posvar

its as ioted that Pitt and the University of

California at Berkeley were

campuses in this country consider- ‘

ed by the Peking University for such

_ iancellor recently returned

from a tour of mainland China last
month and was joined by Associate
Provost David Powers, Pitt Profes-
sor James (Chiao-min) Hsieh of the
Chineses studies department and
representatives from Gulf Oil and
NASA. V

Posvar compared the Peking
school to state teachers colleges in
this country.

“It is much smaller than major
colleges in the U.S.,” Posvar said.
“The, graduate programs are just
now being reinstated. During
the Cultural Revolution they almost
destroyed the University system.
The year Peking University re-
opened they had five million
applications for 2,000 spaces.”

Posvar said his entourage was
somewhat restricted in the areas
they were permitted to tour. Places

visited included Canton, Shanghai,
Shen Yang, Dairan (Lu ta) and
Peking.

“The most important place we
visited was the Forbidden City,” he
said. “It is a series of courtyards
and pavillions-very impressive and
encompassing at least one square
mile.”

Posvar compared China to the
Soviet Union, which he has visited
on different occasions.

“The Chinese people are an
extremely warm people. Eager to
assist. I was pleasantly ‘surprised
by the friendliness of the people.
In the Soviet Union that is not the
common impression. In Russia they
tend to be quite aloof.”-

Posvar found the Chinese state to
be just as oppressive as the Soviet

Union although the two, communist

regimes use different methods of
achieving conformity. He said there
were many signs of police
oppression in the Soviet Union but
in China, “conformity is enforced
through social pressure. There is
less liberty in China-to travel to
choose and to change. In Russia the
system is based on authority.”
People who fail to conform in China
are subjected to public scorn and
considered social outcasts.

He — added, however, that the
Soviet-Chinese relations continue to
be strained.

“The Chinese were very
staunchly critical of the Soviet
Union,” he said, “and they
expressed this. They always
brought it up. ’ ’ They referred to the

and consume alcoholic beverages.
The current bill was amended by
‘he Law and Justice Committee of
the Senate to exclude 18-year-olds.
This amendment was followed by
acceptance in the Senate last J une.
Medoff said legislators believe the
amendment would help keep liquor
“out of the high schools.”
Today’s meeting involves a
‘ ‘loose confederation’ ’ of state-wide
student organizations who will
attempt to “get together and try to
figure out ways to get the bill
passed” in the House, according to
Medoff. He added that the student
lobby will receive help from several
groups which support the bill,
including the Tavern association, ”
a pretty strong lobby.’’ -

“Something like this (the drink-
ing bill) is the type of project
students would show more interest
in getting involved with,” he said.

He added taht the Public and
Governmental Relations (PGR)
Committee of Student Government
planned to actively participate in
the fall elections, campaigning for
legistlators up for reelection who

have indicated support for the 1973“‘

bill and the current bill.

Hesidence said participants at
today’s meeting would discuss
similiar plans.

“They will try to get it (the bill)
passed by supporting legislators
who had shown support for the bill
in the past,” he said.

soviet state as one which practices
‘social imperialism’.~”

Posvar said there were many
instances of “hero worship” in
China, with the memory of former
Chairman Mao prevelent in every
facet of society.

“Their hero worship is even
stronger than in the Soviet Union, ’ ’
he said. “Most of the songs are
dedicated in Mao's memory. They
have no choice but to be reverent. ”

The newspaper service in China
(The People’s Daily) is similiar to
the Tass news agency in Russia,
Posvar said, although in China most
news stories are shown publicly on
walls and there is no great need to
purchase papers. In China, private
ownership ends with clothing
furniture and food.

The Pittsburgh group was

Chinese industry similiar to the
Soviet System.

“The basic technology in China
has advanced,” he said. “Their
main task is to modify the country.’ ’

Posvar said he was surprised by
the day to day lifestyle of the people.

“Everyone gets up at five in the
morning to walk and exercise to
music,” he said, and the basic
uniform worn by the people was
restricted to white, short sleeve
shirts, shorts and sandals.

Mrs. Posvar had the privilege of
singing in a public theatre and
souvenirs brought back included
acupuncture dolls and hand-made
rice paper posters by students at a
“middle” or grade school.

Posvar expressed hope that he
could return to China in the future
and that the exchange program
between Pitt and Peking would
someday be a reality.

“There definitely will be an
expansion of ties between the U.S.
and China in the future,” he said.

New Editor Stresses SGS News

(Continued from Page I)

“I think past editors did a
commendable job, But nobody was
here long enough to carry on their
work,” he said. “There was very
little continuity in the paper last
year.”

To combat this problem, Peterson
plans to establish an organization
that can continue the policies of the
Night Times from year to year and
allow a present staff member to

- become editor after he leaves his

post next year.

With a publication schedule of 18
papers and a $7600 budget, plus
advertising revenues, Peterson said
the Night Times should manage to
“come out in the black.”

In the past year, the Night Times
has suffered from unstable
management. Since January, two
other editors besides Peterson have
headed the SGS’s newspaper. 

Jul Magrini was editor until he
resigned over a controversy during
the SGS Student Cabinet elections
in March. Jerry Musinsky then

Griffith photo

served as interim editor until the
Student Cabinet elected Peterson to
the position.

Kathy Stevens, SGS Student
Cabinet President, said Peterson’s
appointment was part of the normal
selection of committee chairman
and a Night Times editor by the new
cabinet. ‘

“We had five applicants, and the
cabinet felt Larry was the best
choice,” Stevens said. “It was not
a personal reﬂection on Jerry
Musinsky.”

Jenner and Bo wles Look To Team Up

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Junior college transfers Scott Jenner and
Kenny Bowles have been teaming up on
pass plays for the past eight years.

“We started playing football together in
junior high,” said the 5-5, 155-pound
Bowles, who was on the receiving end of 43
Jenner tosses at Sacramento Community
College last year.

Both would like to see the trend continue
this season.

“We would like to start together,” said
Jenner, a strong candidate to unseat
holdovers Rick Trocano and Lindsay
Delaney at quarterback. “Kenny and I have
been playing together for so long, it would
be kind of nice to continue that here, too.”

‘ ‘It would make it a whole lot easier for me
to catch if Bruce were throwing,” Bowles
added. _

Bowles faces stiff competition from
holdovers Ralph Still, Willier Collier,
converted defensive back Tony Campbell,
junior college transfer Clifford Moore and
freshman Keith Williams. .

“It’s going to be hard, ’ ’ admitted Jenner,
who passed for
touchdowns last season. “But we knew that
when we decided to come to Pitt.”

The two have been working daily at Pitt
Stadium sincearriving in Pittsburgh two
weeks ago.

“We’ve just been passing and getting in
shape,” Jenner said. “We work out every
weekday and alternate weekends.”

stronger is the fact that they’re also
off-the-ﬁeld buddies.

“It’s somewhat funny the way we met,”
Bowles added. “We were in seventh grade
at the time and we both went out for
quarterback. We fought it out there for
awhile and then they made Scott
quarterback and moved me to wide receiver.
We've been at the same positions ever
since.”

Jenner and Bowles have played together
since that time—with the exception of their
freshman season, when the quarterback was
at Idaho State and Bowles at Nevada-Las
Vegas.

“Even then, we kept in touch,” Jenner
said.

“Yeah, I’ll always remember the time we
played them (Idaho State) that season,”
Bowles said. ‘ ‘It was the first time Scott and
Iwere opponents. It seemed really strange.
When that game was over, we went out
together and didn’t get in until really late.”

The two transferred to Sacramento >

Community College after that season,
leading Sacramento to its first winning
season In years.

“The year before we arrived the team was
something like 1-9,” Jenner explained.
“The next season, we were 7-3.”

‘ ‘It made us feel good that people believed
we were largely responsible for such a good
season,” Bowles said. “Junior college
football is big out there.” » ,

After such a season, Jenner and Bowles
were heavily recruited by many of the
western universities.

“UCLA, San Jose State and Stanford all
wanted us, ” Jenner said. “I was going to go
to UCLA before I found out they already had
a pretty good, young quarterback (Rick
Bayshore).

“If I had gone there, Kenny probably
would have too, since we had the
understanding we wanted to continue

_ playing together. ”

weighed the routs of Temple,
Tulane, Boston College and William
& Mary. Even after the Panthers
treated Clemson like a Temple
branch campus in the Gator Bowl,
those two losses and a tie prevented
Pitt from remaining at the pinnacle
of college football.

Football has not only evolved into
a year-round proposition for the
players and coaches, but fans also
seem to begin anticipating the
season earlier and debating its
results later each year.

With fall camp still more than a
month away, the season opener six
weeks into the future, many of the
gurus and prognosticators have
already begun their analysis of the
power struggle that will take place
in stadiums across the country for
three months.

While many predictions center on
depth charts and graduation losses,
Steve Hurwitz has concentrated on
scheduling. Hurwitz determined
the ten toughest and easiest
schedules in the nation by grading
the competition in relation to the
caliber of the school itself. For
example, Michigan State is a more
difficult opponent for Rice than it
would be for Southern California.

Hurwitz has determined that Pitt
will play the sixth toughest schedule
in the nation this season. In addition
to traveling to South Bend and State
College, Hurwitz notes that games
with North Carolina (picked by one
football publication to crack the top
10), Florida State and Syracuse will
be difficult tests. This assessment is
due to different factors——one being
the Panthers’ large number of
graduation losses.

It was determined that Rice plays

“Our non-conference schedule is
not conducive to building con-
ﬁdence in a young and inexper-
ienced football team,’ ” said Kansas
head coach Bud Moore. “I said the
same things last year, and it's still
true.” ‘

Moore can
tune-ups with Washington, UCLA
and, Texas A&M before battling
Oklahoma, Nebraska and the rest of
the Big 8. It is doubtful that Moore
gets much solace from thewfact that
the Jayhawks play the third
toughest schedule in the land. ’

Michigan State, riding the right
arm of quarterback Ed Smith, would
be a contender to break up the
Woody and Bo show in the Big 10 if
the schedule makers had shown
some mercy. The Spartans open

with Purdue, Syracuse, Southern 2

California, Notre Dame and then

“Michigan. Frustration could reign

supreme in East Lansing this year.

Rounding out the rest of the top
10 are Syracuse, Indiana, Duke,
California and Miami of Florida, in
addition to the Panthers.

Hurwitz determined that the 10
easiest schedules belong to Georgia
Tech, Louisiana State, Florida
State, Clemson, Penn State, Ohio

State, Colorado, Army, Air Force

and North Carolina.

Any satisfaction Panther fans get
from having their faithful battle a
difficult schedule should be negated
since four of the teams that play the
easy schedules will meet Pitt some
time during the season.

However, many of the weak-
nesses that the gurus are ﬁnding
with Pitt will be plugged with the
Sherrill youth and the Panthers will
end up in or very near the Top 10.
