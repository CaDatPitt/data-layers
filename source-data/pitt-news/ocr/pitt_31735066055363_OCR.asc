SGB: Too few voters

Jason Gatlinger

Assistant News Editor

Voter turnout at Student Government
Board elections is so low that board mem-
ber Damon Hudac wants students to con—
sider what life would be like if there were
no student government.

Hudac is thinking about making a
sign that lists SGB’s accomplishments
this and last semester so students could
see -how different campus life would be
without the board.

That, he hopes, might jolt them into
voting in November.

With less than a
month until the elec-
tion, SGB is urgently
searching for a way to
get more students to
the polls. As to
whether the board
will use signs like
Hudac’s or a more
aggressive campaign,
the details have not
been set in stone.
Regardless, members
say, voter turnout is
“pathetic,” and some-
thing has to be done.

The number of
students who vote “is

the student body,” Hudac said. Last year,
only about 2,000 students out of 14,468
enrolled at the Oakland campus voted in
student-govemment elections.

“Students are really apathetic and
love to complain but aren’t voting to do
anything about [what dissatisﬁes them],”
said board member Adam Tekel, who
won his seat by a margin of 23 votes.

Hudac and Tekel identiﬁed two fac-
tors they think hinder voter turnout: Off-
campus students tend to ignore elections,
and the elections themselves are often
one—sided.

Neither board member was able to
provide statistics showing the discrepancy
between on- and off-campus voters. Both
insisted, however, that students who live
in North and South Oakland avoid the
polls but still complain that, among other
issues, the student activities fee is used for
events that don’t include them.

Students who live oﬂ’-campus pay the
same activities fee “as people in the
Towers,” Tekel said, and they could
derive the same beneﬁts as resident stu-
dents if they expressed the interest.

To combat the problem, Tekel advo-

cates putting signs encouraging people to
vote in off-campus restaurants. He said
commuting students will be more likely to
see signs posted in restaurants, since
“everybody has to eat.”

The fact that most candidates for stu-
dent government belong to Greek organi-
zations stacks the SGB with fraternity and
sorority members, Tekel said. He said in
last year’s election, Alyson Wallach,
Kelly Meyers and Hudac were the only
elected candidates who were not Greek.

As such, Tekel said, the majority of
voters are Greeks, which makes elections
more like a popularity
contest among mem-
bers of Greek organi-
zations.

Tekel, a mem-
ber of Alpha Epsilon
Pi, said the only rea-
son his brothers voted
in last year’s election
was because he was a
candidate.

Tekel
Hudac asserted that
SGB plays a role in
' every University poli-
cy that affects stu-
dents, both academic
and social. For exam-
ple, the board is study-
ing the feasibility of
raising the quality point award for B+
grades. SGB has successfully negotiated
changes to meal plans, and the board
sponsors Homecoming events.

The allocations committee also has a
hand in campus life, deciding which stu-
dent organizations get money and how
much. .

Considering SGB’s wide-ranging
impact on students and the fact that voting
takes about ﬁve minutes, Hudac said the
decision to vote should be a “no-brainer.”

“You better make sure that the people
who get elected share the same beliefs
and values that you do,” he said.

Hudac and Tekel will take their ideas
for improving voter turnout to the full
SGB for approval and funding. Hudac is
considering an exit poll to gather demo-
graphic information about Pitt voters, an
initiative the board would have to
endorse.

Regardless of what steps are taken,
Hudac and Tekel insist that students must
take a ‘stronger interest in SGB and the
elections.

“I’m here to beneﬁt students, not
myself,” Tekel said.

State Department turns press from
speech about United Nations

Dan Sauder
Senlor Staff Wrlter

Pittsburgh media, including The Pitt
News, were asked to leave Bruce Hall
Monday evening when reporters attempt-
ed to cover an event co-sponsored by a Pitt
organization.

A press release was sent out earlier last
week to the local media, inviting them to
attend the “Why We Love to Hate the
United Nations” talk, but according Dr.
Laura Hastings, a Pitt professor, the release
should never have been sent.

Hastings said she had to “escort”
reporters from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and the Tribune Review ﬁom the building.

Hastings claimed that the U.S. State
Department did not want to see an “inter-
national incident” because of the speaker’s
personal views and remarks. The speaker
was not authorized to comment on the

United Na1ion’s behalf.
The event featured Dr. Katherine

’ Magraw, Special Assistant to the United

States Undersecretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security, and
was in celebration of United Nations Day.

When a reporter approached Hastings
for the second time, she said, “It’s standard
procedure. Ask anyone who knows any-
thing about international relations and they
will tell you. You can’t quote anyone from
the state department.” She abruptly walked
away and returned to her seat.

The talk was sponsored by the United
Nations Association of Pittsburgh and the
Graduate “School of Public and
International Affairs of the University of
Pittsburgh.

As part of the celebration, wine,
cheese and hors d’ oeuvres were served
before the lecture in a luxurious suite of
1201 Bruce Hall.

The Taste That

Pitt gets $1.8 million grant

Marty Miller
For The Pitt News

A collaborative effort by several
departments in Pitt’s College of Arts and
Sciences helped the University land a $ 1.8
million grant from the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute to fund various programs
over the next ﬁve years.

HHMI, a prestigious medical research
organization, supports science education in
the United States as well as a select group of
researchers abroad.

Headed by Dr. Lyrme A. Hunter, the
departments of biological sciences, chem-
istry, neuroscience, computer science and
physics combined eiforts to campaign for
the grant. This year marked the sec-
ond time Pitt was selected for the grant. In
1992, the University received $1.7 million
for a similar program.

The money will be divided to fund fel-
lowships, an undergraduate internship pro-
gram and outreach activities for local high
school science classes.

Funds will also be used to improve our-
riculurns, to fund a joint-use computer lab
for the chemistry and biology departments,
and to support other computer labs such as

the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

“It [receiving this grant] is not trivial
and requires an enormous amount of work
 you have to demonstrate excellence,”
Hunter said.

She said that out of $91 million allotted
by HH1VlI and 191 schools chosen to apply,
Pitt’s award of $1.8 million displays its
prowess as a research facility.

Pitt was also honored with the
Beckman Award. The University was cho-

. sen from 130 applicants to receive one of 20

awards.

Hunter said the grants offer students
various ways to engage themselves in 1eam—
ing outside of the classroom. The Beckman
Award will provide funding for six under—
graduate research fellowships and 16 surn-
mer fellowships. The award will also help
fund scienoe camps for middle and high
schools, in which interns will teach work-
shops in collaboration with high school
teachers.

Hunter pointed out that the grants
reﬂected positively on the staffs that worked
toward acquiring them.

‘There is an incredible commitment to
the students who are the unsung heroes of
the whole thing,” she said.

Man charged with sexually
assaulting sleeping students

Joy Davia
A Dally Orange

, SYRACUSE, N.Y. (U—WIRE) —

employee with sexually assaulting female
students while they slept in their roorrrs.

Cedric Holmes, 27, of 116 Gorland
Ave., used his employee I.D. card early
Saturday morning to access the
Brewster/Boland complex through the
Brockway Dining Center loading dock,
SU spokesman Kevin Morrow said.

“He climbed into bed with several
young women and reportedly molested
some young women,” SU spokesman
Kevin Morrow said. “He had a knowledge
of the residence hall and knew that some
young women left their doors unlocked.”

Holmes is charged with nine counts of
second—degree burglary, four counts of
ﬁrst-degree sexual abuse and ﬁve counts
of ﬁrst—degree attempted sexual abuse,
Syracuse Police Sgt. Sam Galvagno said.

Hohnes is currently in police custody,
Galvagno said.

“The intruder has a past of entering
the dorm, speciﬁcally unlocked doors,”
Galvagno said.

Holmes allegedly entered the com-
plex at about 5 am. with the intention of
locating a female friend, Morrow said. His
attempts to locate the friend were unsuc-
cessful and Holmes proceeded to walk
throughout Boland Hall breaking into
unlocked dorm rooms, Morrow said.

Holmes was intoxicated at the time of
his alleged entries, Morrow added. Karen
Chesley, an undecided freshman in the S.I.
Newhouse School of Public
Communications and the College of Arts
and Sciences, said Hohnes broke into her
room and attempted to get into her bed.

“I woke up when I felt someone start-
ing to get on my bed,” said Chesley. “I
looked up and saw someone looming over
me.”

Chesley said she “ran to tum on the
lights,” and asked the man why he was in
her room. The man said, “sorry, wrong
room,” and ran out, she said.

“I was stunned and at first I thought it
was a dream,” she said. Residents who
were confronted by Holmes contacted
Public Safety between 5:30 and 7:30 a.m.,
Morrow said. Following Public Safety’s
arrival, the Brewster/Boland complex was
closed and a room-by—room search was
conducted, he said.

Public Safety’s search of the complex
was negative, Morrow said. Police later
spotted Holmes in a parking lot east of the
Carrier Dome and approached him
because be matched the suspect’s descrip-
tion, Morrow said.

Three students were asked by police
to identify Holmes, but they did not make

a positive identiﬁcation and Holmes was
released, Morrow said.

ging  suspicions and prompting them

.10  hime-to police headquarters for
questioning, Morrow said.

At police headquarters, Holmes
admitted that he entered the residence halls
Saturday and sexually assaulted residents.

_ Chesley said it took two calls to
Public Safety before an ofﬁcer made it to
her room. She made calls at 5:37 a.m. and
30 minutes later, after they did not
respond.

Officials from Public Safety were sur-
prised about Ches1ey’s concerns when she
inquired about their whereabouts, she said.

“She said, ‘oh you wanted to talk to
someone? We just sent someone to look
around your ﬂoor,’” Chesley said.

Ten minutes after her second call, a
Public Safety ofﬁcer visited her room to
ask her questions. After explaining her sit-
uation, the ofﬁcer told her that this is a
common occurrence, Chesley added.

“They said, ‘do not worry this hap-
pens all the time. He was probably just
drunk and could not ﬁnd his room,”’ she
said.

Public Safety could not be reached for
comment.

Students living in the
Brewster/Boland complex said they felt
violated by Holmes’ alleged intrusion.

“It makes me question the security
and safety of our dorm,” said Zakir Baig, a
freshman speech communications major
and Boland resident.

Jessica Washbum, a freshman psy-
chology major and fellow resident, agreed.

“I know a lot of people feel vulnerable
and unsafe since this happen ,” she said.
“We feel unsafe just walking to the bath-
room or sleeping. This is where we live
and it is crazy that a stranger can just walk
up in to one of our rooms.”

Dana Sacchetti, president of the
Student Government Association, said 10
to 150 students attended an open forum
conducted Sunday night in the
Brewster/Boland complex.

Students expressed a variety of securi-
ty concerns, including Public Safety’s
“lackluster” response to their calls

Monday morning, he said.
“Students were very upset at Public
Safety’s response,” Sacchetti said

“Students still have a lot of concerns that
were not answered.”

Students were also concerned that SU
did not check Holmes’ criminal record
prior to his hiring — especially because he
has been previously caught entering build-
ings illegally, Sacchetti said.

‘This is really troubling,” he said.
“\V1th a background check, I think this
person would not have been hired.”

Reporters have the right to
cover public meetings

Reporters from The Pitt News, the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the
Tribune Review were asked not to
report on a speech given in Bruce Hall
last night by Dr. Katherine Magraw,
Special Assistant to the United States
Undersecretary for Arms Control and
International Security.

The State Department, her
employer, said the press release
armouncing the event was not sup-
posed to be released. It was distributed
by Pitt’s News Bureau at the request
of the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Afraid that the
views of Dr. Magraw might be con-
fused with those of the State
Department, the organizers asked that
reporters not do a story on the speech.

Ifthe meeting was organized at a
public university, with no limitations
on who could attend, why were
reporters invited to the meeting yet
not allowed to write a news story
about it? State Department regulations
or not, if the meeting is conducted in a
public setﬁng, it’s fair game for the
media.

According to KQV Radio, which
tried to secure an interview with Dr.
Magraw Monday, the State
Department won’t allow any of its
employees to speak with the media
Because of the Middle East Peace
Accord last Friday, the only exception
was Secretary of State Madeleine

Albright.

If Dr. Magraw’s speech could
cause an “international incident,” as
GSPIA professor Dr. Laura Hastings
claimed, why was the meeting not
cancelled, if the organizers knew that
Dr. Magraw was not allowed to talk
the media?

Pitt’s News Bureau did not know
until yesterday afternoon that the
event was closed to the media. And
had a reporter sat in the meeting, taken
notes and wrote about the meeting for
the next day, the State Department
wouldn’t have been able to do any-
thing about it.

As for the State Departrnent’s
excuse regarding why they blanketed
the speech, the topic, “Why we [the
United States] love to hate the United
Nations,” had nothing to do with
Middle Eastern Alfairs. No breaches
of national security would have
occurred and there would have been
no international incident. What world
leader would have taken seriously a
small ﬁgure in the State Department
speaking on Palestinian affairs in a
second-string American city?

The meeting went on, even
though Dr. Magraw should not have
continued But since it was an open
meeting, there is absolutely no justiﬁ-
cation in saying reporters, the eyes
and ears of the student body, were not
allowed to cover it. .

Ubi solitudenumfaciunt, pacem appellant.

—Tacitus

It is incumbent upon all of us to recog-
nize the realities behind the latest declaration

of “peace in our time,” which was accompa— 1

mod on Friday by a lot of mutually congratu-
latory effusiveness on the part of all parties
involved. 1

Let’s be clear about the details of the
“compromise,” which Netanyahu has said
was so difficult for him to make. The Israelis
have agreed to re—deploy (not withdraw!)
from 13 percent of the Occupied Territories,
as compared with the original Palestinian
Liberation Organization demand for 40 per-
cent. Of the whopping 13 percent in question,
only 1 percent will be turned over to full
Palestinian Authority control. The remaining
12 percent will be under Palestinian
Authority civil administration, but will
remain subject to Israeli security
control. Also, 3 percent of that JOHN
will be designated a “nature
reserve,” unavailable for
Palestinian settlement or con-
struction.

The proposed Palestinian “airport” and
“seaport” will be completely monitored and
able to be searched by the Israelis, as is the
case with all “border crossings” into
Palestinian “autonomy” areas. Meanwhile, at
the behest of Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon — a war criminal so thoroughly inhu-
mane that even Israeli courts found him cul-
pable for the 1982 massacre of Sabra-Shatila
— bypass roads connecting the Jewish settle-
ments in the West Bank will continue to be
built. This ensures that no real contiguous
Palestinian state will be possible, no matter
what Arafat says to the contrary.

The chairman, it seems, has shed what
little shame he once possessed Despite his
having to sit on the opposite side of the nego-
tiating table from the likes of Netanyahu and
Sharon, he nevertheless continues to behave
as if the whole putrid exercise were still
worth taking seriously. In return for aid and
weaponry to bolster his “authority,” Arafat

Israel in improving surveillance methods and
will openly assist the Palestinian Authority in
hunting down suspected “terrorists.”

Translation: The CIA is going to help
Arafat root out his political opponents, as the
Palestinian Authority becomes more and
more a gendarme for the Israelis in the
Territories. The same day the agreement was
signed, newly declassiﬁed documents pro-.
vided even more evidence of CIA complicity
with Central American death squads in the
1980s, this time in Honduras. Expect more of
the same from that august agency in Palestine
in the near future, with crucial assistance pro-
vided by the Palestinian Authority.

Indeed, Arafat demonstrated his willing-
ness to act as the taskrnaster of the
Occupation even before the ink on the agree-
ment was dry Also, on Friday, Palestinian
Authority police arrested 10 journalists
(including an American, if that really matters)
outside of the home of Sheikh
Ahmad Yasin, leader of Harnas.
Their ﬁlms were conﬁscated, and
they were informed that they
were not to interview Yasin with-
out prior permission of the
Authority. No doubt many of the same peo-
ple who denounced Slobodan Milosevic’s
crackdown on the independent media in
Serbia after the Kosovo agreement will
attempt to gloss over Arafat’s gross violation
of civil liberties as a mere momentary excess
in the “war on terrorism,” if they do not
applaud it outright.

In the crude propaganda of empire, those
who oppose the dictates of the powerful can
be nothing other than the “enemies of peace.”
In today’s world there is no better example of
the cruel injustice of this formulation than the
case of Palestine, which has endured what is
by far the longest military occupation of the
20th century. Two thousand years after
Tacitus gave us the immortal description of
the Romans by the Scottish chieftain
Calgacus, the arrogance of empire remains
the same: “They make a desolation, and they
call it peace.” .

Time for a
quarterback
change

Matt Lytle was the answer, but is
he now?

No.

After summer football camp,
head coach Walt Harris named Lytle
the starting quarterback. He said
Lytle was the best player at that
position, but this could have been a
case in which Lytle was the lesser of
two evils.

Lytle lost the job last year, after
starting in 1996, to upstart fifth—year
senior Pete Gonzalez, who went on
to do great things for Pitt and now
for the Steelers.

Gonzalez did everything Harris
wanted him to do. He watched film,
asked questions and worked hard,
earning the starting quarterback’s
job. Lytle expected Harris to hand
him the job in 1997 and suffered
some disappointment when that was
not the case.

Lytle stood on the sideline all of
last year, sending in plays for
Gonzalez. Harris and the rest of the
Panther program thought this would
be a wake-up call, and it was. At
least it seemed that way.

This year, Lytle went through
spring and summer drills with a
newfound enthusiasm. He looked to
be just the man the program needed
in order to keep things moving in
the right direction.

Lytle watched film, asked ques-
tions and worked hard —— just like
Gonzalez. His dedication seemed
like just what the doctor ordered fo
a recovering Pitt program. '

Unfortunately, this was not the '

case. All of that hard work did not
pay off like it did for Gonzalez.
Lytle has struggled this year, to say
the least.

Lytle is 84-151 with 11 touch-
downs and nine interceptions. He
has thrown for 1,127 yards, but his
average is only 187.8 yards-per-
game. Last year, Gonzalez finished
the season with 30 touchdowns,
seven interceptions and averaged
241.5 yards-per-game.

Lytle’s team is’ not as good as
Gonzalez’s, but that is no excuse.
Obviously, Lytle has not gotten the
job done, and it is time for a change.

Junior college transfer Matt
O’Connor did not get the starting

Quarterback change may be in future

As the Panthers prepare for
Saturday’s meeting with the
Syracuse Orangemen, they do so
with two of football’s most dreaded
words hanging over their heads.

‘Quarterback controversy.

Coach Walt Harris said at his
weekly press conference yesterday

‘that while the best possible scenario

for the team would be to stick with
fifth—year senior Matt Lytle behind
center, Lytle’s play of late may
force a change at quarterback.
Junior transfer Matt O’Connor is
Lytle’s only competition.
So who is going to get the start?
' “I know, but I haven’t decided to
talk about it yet,” Harris said.
‘‘You’ll see. Like I said last week,
it’s a day—to—day thing, and this
week’s really important with trying
to find the guy that’s going to exe-
cute our system the best. So that’s
an in-progress operation.”
Lytle, who during the second
half of last week’s game against
Rutgers had two passes intercepted

and could not lead the Panthers
offense to a score, is still a possibil-
ity to be on the field Saturday.

“I admire how hard he’s worked
and I’ve admired a lot of things he’s
done. He just has to put his game
together, and my goal, personally, is
to make Matt Lytle better,” Harris
said.

While progress may be be the
coach’s goal for Lytle, he also has a
conference game to worry about on

Saturday.

“We’re going up [to
Syracuse] with one intent, and that
intent is to try to do everything we
can to win the game,”
he said. -

That “everything” may include
the benching of his senior quarter-
back.

PHILADELPHIA —- Two and
three—quarter miles of the
Schuylkill were lined this past
Saturday with both the gold and
amber of fall, and the shells and
participants of 1,010 crews.

Pitt traveled six hours and was
welcomed to a beautiful cloudless
day for the Head of the Schuylkill
Rowing Regatta, held between the
Canoe Club and Boathouse Row.
Running through Fairmount Park,

the Schuylkill was the sight of 25
events, which included high
schools, colleges, rowing clubs and
individuals.

The women’s club four “A” boat
placed an impressive fifth in a field
of 38.

Sterling Odom, the women’s
varsity coach, was very pleased
with the result.

“The Schuylkill is one of the
most competitive races for Pitt. I’m
also happy with our eight —- they
raced together for the first time and

‘ lightweights were in the club boat.”

The women’s club four “B” boat
finished 25th, and the club eight
placed 14th out of 36.

The men’s club eight placed in
the middle of the pack, receiving
21st place out of 38.

Included in their highly compet-
itive field was the U.S. Naval
Academy, Syracuse and Princeton.

The men’s four with cox placed
33rd in a field of 49, and the men’s
lightweight eights finished 13th in a
field of 18. On their first trip, the

O’Connor, Harris said, “He’s a fair-
ly consistent passer. He doesn’t
have the, let’s say, velocity, or
maybe the speed that Matt Lytle
has, but I think that he wi_ll try to do
what he is coached to do to the best
of his ability.”

Harris also said that O’Connor
“assures m& be is_,a gamer.”

Starting.;fO’Connor may be a bit
of a gamble,-however. Aside from
the fact that he has thrown only 15
passes this year, Harris said
O’Connor is suffering from a “form

of laryngitis.” If he does start, his"

illness will certainly hinder his abil-
ity to hear under the roof of the loud
Carrier Dome.

Joining O’Connor on the injury
list is the majority ‘of Pitt’s back-
field. Kevan Barlow is nursing a lin-

gering ankle injury and is question-
able for Saturday. Isaac Williams,
who had the best game of his career
after replacing Barlow against
Rutgers, has stress fractures in both
of his thighs and will not play.

Also injured are fullbacks Chris
Schneider and Mark Moothart, who
are both questionable for the game.

The Panthers will need all of the
healthy bodies they can get if they
are to seriously challenge the 19th-
ranked Oranggmen and their bril-
liant senior quarterback, Donovan
McNabb. Harris showed that he has
as much respect for the Heisman
Trophy prospect as does the "rest of
the country.

“They are led by, I believe, the
most dominant player in our confer-
ence in Donovan McNabb,” Harris
said. “His escape ability and poise
under pressure is really what sepa-
rates him from everyone else.”

CREW

men’s and women’s novice eights
placed 21st out of 34 and 25th out
of 43, respectively.

“Our novice team did really
well, and we beat Temple, a very
prominent Philadelphia team,” said
Jean Meta, the women’s novice
coach.

“They had a good time for their
first race and said they felt really
strong together.”

The Head of the Occoquan this
Saturday marks the end of Pitt’s fall
season.

FROM PAGE 6

“The competition at the
Occoquan isn’t as intense.” said
Odom. “We should be able to place
very well and the race is a lot more
laid back. We’re looking to have
fun in Virginia.”

After the Occoquan, Pitt’s
novices will compete in the Car-
Du—Pitt, a Pittsburgh regatta that
will also feature Duquesne,
Carnegie Mellon and Robert
Morris.

Indoor races are set for the win-
ter season, and a series of sprint
races in the spring, including the
very prominent Dad Vail, held in
Philadelphia.

job in camp because he did not
understand the offense, but last
week in practice he did take most of
the snaps with the first team.

O’Connor never really gave
Lytle any competition in camp,
because he did not fully grasp the
Panthers’ complicated West Coast
Offense. But he has had all year to
understand the offense and should
now be able to run it well.

Coach Harris may have seen
enough from the fifth-year senior.
He may want to start O’Connor this
weekend, and it may not be because
of the performance of Lytle. It very
well could be because of the things
Lytle has said of late.

In an interview with the the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Lytle ques-
tioned whether he should be starting
on this team.

This is not the kind of quarter-
back the Panthers need going into
their most difficult road game of the
year. They do not need their quarter-
back, who is not playing well, to not

FROM PAGE 6

even have confidence in himself.

With these events, maybe it is
time to bring O’Connor in off of the
bench and give him a chance. If
nothing else, it may serve as a cata-
lyst for the team, which needs some
sort of positive momentum if it has
any chance of going to a bowl game
this season.

Maybe it will ‘light a fire under
the offensive line or the running
backs. Maybe it will fire up an
already good defense. Maybe it will
get the receivers to work a little
harder. Maybe it will 

Well, it can’t be any worse than

it is right now, and you never know
what may happen. Remember ‘the
program-building win against
Miami, the shocker against Virginia
Tech, the near win against Syracuse
and the miracle at West Virginia last
year?
Just maybe

Pitt. Last year, we raised over $1.3 million to improve our university — and we

coolest department at Pitt.
