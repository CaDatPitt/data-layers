Talks to Forum

On Cooperatives

Shore Will Consider
Effect of War Boom

On Consumer Groups

Speaking on the “Present Status of ,

Consumer’s Cooperative Projects in
the United States” Henry Shore, L34,
will address the Inquiry Forum to-
day at 1 o’clock in 132 Cathedral, ac-
cording to Esther Marcuson, C41,
chairman.

Mr. Shore is attorney for the Na-
tional Labor Relations board. He is
president of the Allegheny " County
cooperative association and played
a prominent part in the Republic
Steel company labor case which was
heard in the Uniontown district sev-
eral months ago.
~ The possible future of cooperatives
under the stimulation of war-time
booms and increased prices will be
considered by Mr. Shore in his dis-
cussion.

The main idea of the consumer’s
cooperative is service. It is a con-
structive system and the projects
throughout the country believe that
it is the basis for a new economic and
social system, Miss Marcuson states.

Mr. Shore will explain the aims of
cooperation and point out its place
in the American scene. In addition,
his talk will cover the present trends
in cooperative activity in the United
States.

After Football Classic Last F all

By William E. lVIcElwain
Guest Contributor
It’s two full weeks until the Pitt-
Tech game but the “missing goal
post” enigma is back again.
Carried off by triumphant Tech
students after last year’s catastrophe,
defended by the same Tech students
against recapture by Pitt forces, and
ﬁnally imbedded in concrete in front
of a Tech dormitory, a pair of goal
posts disappeared last Friday morn-
ing under circumstances which can
be classed only as “suspicious.”
First indication of the mystery was
the arrival of a Wide World Photos’
representative in Frank Carver’s of-
ﬁce. Carver, as publicity director for
Pitt athletics, can answer almost any
question, but he_ wasbstumped when
the visitor q'ueri4ed;~~- “Wi_ie'—re -ware .» the
Tech goal posts?”
\ Lacking a reply, Carver called the
office of ' the Carnegie dean of men,

9

 

but there the question met with a
complete denial that the posts were
gone. The idea was described as pre-
posterous. ‘

Five minutes later, the office of the

   

Carnegie dean of men called Carver. '

The voice at the Tech end of the wire
spluttered, “Say, we looked, and
they really are gone.”

The disappearance results in com-
plications. For the time, it ruins the
suggestion made at the recent meet-
mg of the SFA assembly “that the
goal posts new at Tech be given an-
nually to the winner of the Pitt-Tech
game.”

Carnegie Tech oﬂicials are anxious
to ﬁnd the posts for more than senti-
mental reasons. The .,University.re-

them last year in a midnight raid on ‘

the Stadium. 5

A
Ernest Frank Mazur, formerly a'

brook, dean of the School of’ Engi-
neering, approved the student’s cre-‘
dentials and admitted him » to" the
school. _ .
Mazur left Germany one week be-
fore war was declared. He went to
London, then to New York and, from
there, to Chicago to visit his brother
who is an interne in a Chicago hos-
pital. ' I
and his mother are still in Germany.

Mazur graduated from the regular ’
public and secondary schools of Ber- '

lin and studied for a year and a half

in a technical school in that city. ‘He *
can speak English ﬂuently, having.
studied the language in school and

under private instructors.

He will stay at the Phi Epsilon Pi
fraternity house while studying at the
University. Max Katz, the first ref-
ugee student, to study here, lived at
this house for three years.

Members of the refu.gee_committee
who approved’ lVIazur’s application

Alumni Subsidy

Resulting from the delay of the
University in renewing the Associa-
tion’s $11,000 subsidy of last year, the
alumni have planned an’ intensive
membership drive. “We are de-
terminedto be independent and self-
supporting,” John Nicklas, alumni
president was reported, by a down-
town newspaper, to have said. ,

Mr. Nicklas also revealed that the
report of the University trustees, re-
leased recently, was very similar to
conclusions reached in an alumni in-
vestigation of University affairs.

Next spring the Alumni Association
will nominate 13 members to the 30-
\man board of trustees, an authoriza-
tion obtained three. years ago in an
agreement between Governor Earle
and Chancellor Bowman, following

alumni to gain alumni representation
on the Board. In subsequent. years,
alumni members ‘were gradually
elected. All of the terms end next
spring.

president of the publications commit-
tee of the alumni, publicity director
,of the membership drive of 1930, and
worked for a few months under Rob-
ert X. Graham, director of the Uni-

is the phrase floating around the Ca-

It all concerns the semi.-annual
wager to determine the number of
bids the 13 social fraternities on
campus will submit, the number of
men that will receive bids, and the
number of these bids that will be ac-
cepted.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, together with Edward B.
Williams, director of the placement
bureau forimen, and Robert R. Cor-
ley, assistant dean of men, have sub-
mitted their respective estimates. If
Mr. Corley loses he will have to
shave off his mustache. If Mr. Biddle
and Mr. Williams lose, they will be
compelled to grow mustaches.

Mr. Corley ‘has estimated the num-
ber of bids -at 610,‘ the number of in-
dividuals bid at 395', and thenumber
of acceptances at 220. Mr. Biddle ex-
;-pects 597 bids, 406 individuals bid,

“According to Thursday’s tabulation
at the end of the day, there were 93
acceptances out of 188 men bid. There
are about 195 more men to come in.”

“I’d like to see Mr. Corley shave

The Anvil Chorus
ls Premature

-Now that the complete report o:f the ii.1vestigat-
ing committee of the Board of Trustees has been
made public, along with the Chancellor’s answer,
it seems re.asonabl.e to believe that stories of trou-
ble at the lfiiivcisity may soon die out.

,The tone of the trustees’ report was a disap-
pointment to the sensationalists who hoped tliart
the i‘rivestigatio11 would cause a terriﬁc uproar.
The critici.sm of the administration was milder
ltlian.-was expectctl by inany “critics” of the Uni-
varsity.

From the recon1mendati.on made by the trustees,
it  apparent that the committee members feel tliait
improvements are needed in the University’s ad-
ininistrativc orgaiiizatioii, press relations, library,
la.bora1:or_\', "and. studciit recreational facilities. The
trustees suggested the adoption of a code of fac-
ulty tenui"e, the establislnnent of an advisory cab-
inet of deans and :1 ‘University Council to represent
the faculty. 1\lan_v of these changes have been. sug-
gested bc.fom by studerits, faculty, and alumni.
Most of them can be effected as soon as the money
is ava.ilable.

Tlic reco1nmend.at.ions of the trustee committee
and the Chancellor’s answer are now in the hands
of the executive committee of the Board of
’jl‘ru.stces for si:ii(,ly The Chancellor is a menibcr
of this‘ committee. Presuinably some action on the
trustees’ recoinmendation will be taken by the com-
plete boz1r<l at its December meeting.

Yet last week we heard this ‘comment from the
}.).ll/lSl1)'lll‘§4‘l'1 l:’ress: “Chancellor John G. Bowman
of the l.il'll‘?."E‘lf‘>5lly of Pittsburgh showed by his
reply that he does not intend to pay aiiy attention
to the recoin1n<~i'i(lations . . it is becoming in-
c1?easii'1gly obvious that the ‘University of Pitts-
bni-gh will either continue to be run as the pri-
vate and personz’-1]. institution of ('3-liancellor Bow-
Inan or else there will have to be a, new chancel-
lor.”

"ii is unfortunate that statenients like this must
be cii-culatcdto the people of Pittsburgh before
anyone is in ii position to know what‘ action will
be taken by the University.

» VVe tbelievc that the Chancellor  astute enough
to realize that he cannot. igi-ioretl-1e recoinmenda-I
tions of the trustees. As the matter stands now,
the executive committee of the board and the com-
plete board must consider and approve any action
Whicli is suggested. This approval should come
at the December meeting of the board. .

Now that the recommendations of the trustees
have been made public, tl1e.University should be
afforded a chance to put those recommendations
into effect without being subjected to an anvil
chor'.us of criticisni.

After the second serious accident to a Univer-

Common Sense    
.By ‘Senator’ Ziskind

For the past four weeks Congressmen have been
digging themselves out of an organized barrage of let-
ters and telegrams; and, thanks to a bit of perspective
on their part, they have come ‘out unshaken in their
determination to see the right. The storm of letters
consisted almost unanimously of pleas to retain the
arms embargo. Most all were of stereotyped form, con-
cocted as a mass production project, with a supreme
effort to stampede Congressmen to hasty retreat.

* =n is

The chief mastermind behind this undertaking, of
course, was a Sunday afternoon radio orator. In
gurgling, resonant tones, he appealed to his followers;
he played across his keyboard from “international
bankers” to “war mongers”; he beseeched his pitiful
protagonists to demand the retention of the arms em-
bargo, warning that things in this country might have
to be solved in the “Franco way.” And so came the
barrage of letters to Washington. —

Herein lies a challenge to representative democ-
racy. Has it come to a condition where a small,
cohesive minority can dictate the legislative policy
of a vast country? Are we to conclude that an ar-
ticulate few, whipped to a white hot frenzy by
slippery oratory, are to determine our future? I
shudder to think of the grave peril to free govern-
ment if such is to be the case.

This is a pressure group far more dangerous than
the corrupt lobbyist, than the purchaser of legisla-
tion, than the log-roller or pork barrelist. For this
pressure is brought to bear in the name of “public
will” or “national sentiment.” It threatens the Con-
gressman with political ruin. It seeks to bring the
V Congressman to his “senses” by showing him a “baro-
meter” of public opinion. It performs ostensibly as
an alert and awakened citizenry. '
=19 :;:
Unmask it and see it in its true color, and one ﬁnds
a highly oiled pressure machine, consisting of about a
million people divisible, into a number of groups:
crackpot visionaries, the emotional unstable, and the
innocent but gullible bystander.
Fortunately, on the neutrality issue, Senators have
not fallen victim to this trick. But it may have a de-
cided effect in the House.

, Here indeed, then, is a new threat to our free
democracy. It acts in the name of democracy. It
wears the false cloak of spirited citizenship. It wins
its causes because one million persons, at the behest
of their spokesman, out yell 12-9,000,000 other Ameri- i
cans.

In order to counteract this menace, all we need
do is what we have done about all other such threats
to our institutions. We need not silence, them. We
need not ﬁght them. Simply expose them and their
methods, and their ﬂood of stereotyped letters will
act only as a stimulant toward making up the deﬁcit
under which our. post office has operated for so many
years past.

I At the Record 5
1 By John Burnham

Russia has long adhered to the policy of “playing
both ends against the middle”—of Europe. Russia has
played ball with every powerful nation in Europe but
has been of little value to any of them. Every nation
seeks her friendship, yet all mistrust her. Her record
of alliances is consistent in one thing only: her’ desire
to further her own interests.

For centuries a backward, half—oriental country,
Russia was ﬁnally consolidated in the seventeenth cen-
tury by Peter the Great. Peter borrowed many of his
ideas from the leading courts of Europe, including the
habit of playing the good old?‘ game known as “power
politics.”

His designs on central Europe included plans to
subjugate Poland and what is now Finland. In ad-
dition, he aspired to* gain control of the Black Sea by
subjection of the Balkan states and destruction of the
Turkish Empire. Every czar who followed Peter
cherished these ambitions.

Poland Partitioned

Catherine the Great, Russia’s most illustrious czarina,
got most of Poland by partitioning it with Prussia and
Austria in 1795. Later when a wave of revolutions was
sweeping Europe, Catherine’s successor joined in a
“Holy Alliance” with the monarchs of these two coun-
tries. ’ '

Shortlythereafter, the czar’s diplomats tried to en-
list the aid of Britain in crushing the Turkish Empire.
Britain refused and was joined by France in stopping
Russia’s aggressive moves. The czar waited his chance
and tried to smash Turkey while France was engaged
in the ‘Franco-Prussian War, This_ time England alone
thwarted his carefully laid plans. ’

In the meantime, the czar’s troops were also playing
a hand in the Far East. But the Russo—Japanese War
proved a miserable failure for Russia; a humiliating
peace was concluded in 1905.

Forms New Alliance ,_
Having lost in the Black Sea and in the Orient,
Russia once more turned her attention to affairs in
central Europe. The Triple‘ Alliance between Ger-
many, Austria, and Italy forced her into an alliance
with her old adversaries, England and France.
Internally, Russia was on the verge -or revolution.
The czarist regime could not have held out much
longer against popular uprisings had the. World War
not broken out. But the defeat of the Russian army

precipitated the downfall of the czar and the with- _ '

drawal of‘ Russia from the War. . -
Because of her withdrawal -from the VVor1_d War”
none of the spoils went to Russia. She lost Poland and
the Baltic states. In addition, the form of -.‘Z0V€I‘f1ment

made her an outlaw among nations.
Since the War, she ‘has been slowly but surely get-

Fireside Chats

Amuse Interest

Student reaction toward Chancellor
John G. Bowman’s ﬁreside chats has
been highly favorable, according to
Mary Gregg, Ed40, chief justice of
the senior court which is sponsoring
the series of informal discussions.

Before a glowing ﬁre in the Chan-
cellor’s study last Thursday, Univer-
sity students discussed the problems
}of students, the administration, and
student-administration relations.

Dr. Bowman answered all ques-
tions which were put to him,
while he in turn asked the students

for suggestions for promoting better
student-administration feeling. '

The ﬁreside chats are held every
Thursday afternoon from 3 to 5
o’clock. Any student who wishes to

leave his name in the office of the
dean of women.

‘of the magazine, organized a hasty

search for the missing gorilla, with an
appeal to students for cooperation
with the publication.

The possibility that the disappear-
ance was staged as a ﬁnal publicity
stunt was considered unlikely when
Hoeveler declared “if the display does
not turn up within a.few days, .we
will be forced to take a loss equal
to the sale of upwards of 700 Panth-
ers.”

Robert C. Machesney, faculty ad-
viser to publications, said that the
loss of the expensive display was un-
fortunate from the standpoint of fu-
ture publicity stunts. “It just means
that in the future original publicity

the present loss,” he declared.

Mr. Machesney further pointed out
that the disappearance of the display
was in no way a publicity stunt and
that the cooperation of students was
needed if the gorillas are to be re-
turned.

Backs Confuse Announcers

Radio announcers had a hard time Saturday distinguishing between
Ernie Bonelli (left), Pitt fullback, and Allan Donelli (right), Duquesne
halfback. Both boys were in the game up their necks, Bonelli scoring
the first Pitt touchdown, and Donelli cutting the Panther line to bits in

the Dukes’ second half drive.

Underdog Dukes Flash Power,
Upset Favored Panthers, 21-13

The l'niv<-r.<3t,\' of Pittsburgh is minus another set of goal posts.

.»'\t'te.r §_"l"%tllillll;I an early lead at the start of the second quarter,
the Pitt Pemtliers had a bomb burst in their faces Saturday as the
Dukes came bar-l< strong to take home a21-13 victory to the Bluff.

Duques'ne's “break” came early in the fourth quarter as Steve
S'mco’s ‘pass from center bounced off Cassiano’s arm into the out-

stretched hands of end Yacina, and¢

the red-shirted Duke trotted into the
end zone to knot the count. Rokisky
«converted to place the Bluifmen
ahead, 14-13.

Pitt scored in the initial quarter
after 13 and a half minutes had
elapsed. Rettinger blocked Nery’s
attempted punt deep in the Dukes’
-own territory, and the ball rolled out
of bounds on. the eight.

Two tries into the line by Cassiano
brought the ball to the one yard line,
and a smash by Ernie Bonelli pro-
duced the first score. Kish’s kick was
wide to the left.

One minute and 20 seconds later,
the Panthers counted again.

Bonelli Scores

Duquesne punted on first down
after Bone1li’s kickoff was taken by
Ahwesh and downed on the nine. On

the next play Bonelli broke l.oose for 3

33 yards from the Pitt 47. Narick’s

long pass was taken by Rettinger onf

the four for a touchdown and Ret-

tir.ger’s nlace kick completed the Pitt ’

scoring for the day.

Duquesne’s first touchdown came 15

seconds before the half ended. Thur-
bon received a bad pass from center,
and his short. punt was taken. by
Yurchey near the side lines and re-
turned to Pitt 23.

George Kracum knocked down a
long Duke pass on the five, but a sec-
ond pass from Ahwesh was caught
by Nery on the six.

Gouda Goes Over

When Kish and Bonelli re-entered
the game, Pitt received a ﬁve yard
penalty for excessive time outs; then,
Gouda ripped through the line for
the Dukes’ touchdown. . Rokisky con-
verted for the seventh point.

Exactly two minutes and 12 sec-
onds after the fourth quarter opened,
Pit=t’s highly favored Panthers real-
ized that their early lead had gone
for naught as the Dukes tallied a
second time and converted for the
extra point. ’ ,

Not content with a one point win,
the Dukes scored a third touchdown
through the aerial route late in the
game after the Panthers had. lost the
ball on downs on the invaders’ 37
yard line.

An about face resulted as the red
shirts put together a long run by
Ahwesh and a forward pass, Ahwesh
to Rokisky in the end zone, from a
spread formation for the Duke root-

Concentration on offensive drill has
been stressed by coaches Walt Ras-
kowski and Chuck Sea in recent
workouts of the little Panther grid
squad.

Put up a strong defense, with the ex-
ception of a few lapses, but were
weak on the attack. Poor co-ordin-
ation of line and backﬁeld and slip-
shod team play, in general, stalled the
Panther offense. ’

West Virginia fans are enthusiastic

least four of its members are almost
certain to break into the varsity line-
up as sophomores next fall. '

It would be impossible to place the
blame for the defeat for, as one Pitt
player remarked after the game, “It
was just one of those days. Every-
thing we tried went wrong-”

a. If the ﬁrst Duquesne pass just
prior to their initial score had.
not slipped through the hands
of a Pitt back, the Dukes would
not have tallied in the ﬁrst half.

.If, two plays before that, Thur-
bon had not been forced to hurry
his kick, a longer punt would I
probably have resulted.

. If the pass from center had not
bounded oﬁ Cassiano’s shoulder
and into 'Yacina’s hands, the
Dukes would not have had such
an easy time gaining their sec-
ond touchdown.

. If, with the s-core 14-13 in the

ﬁnal period, the Panthers had

been able to make an extra six
inches on a fourth down plunge,

Pitt would have been in position

to punch over a third score.

1940 Grid Opener

Puzzles Followers of Rival Elevens

Coming within 24 hours of the Associated Press’s announcement that
the Pitt Panthers had made a runaway in the race for the number 1 posi-
tion in the nation-wide poll conducted by the syndicate’s football scribes,
a rumor that Charley Bowser’s gridmen were to open the 1940 grid season
against the deﬂated W&J pigskin machine rocked the rival alumni camps.

Pitt alumni, after watching a “pitiful squad of second raters” climb to

the top of the nation’s grid pedestal¢

wondered if these reports were a

trick of the Pitt publicity department
or a practical application of Pitt’s
new “de-emphasis policy.”

W & J grads were all ready mark;
ing their 1940 calendars with a black
ring, around September 28. The more
optimistic declared that Red Grange’s
younger brother had enrolled in this
year’s freshman class, and that it was
only ﬁtting to turn him loose against
the Panther before he could be over-
taken by any injuries.

Many district grid fans thought the
W. & .J. eleven was merely going to
come to the Smoky City for a prac-
tice scrimmage, with no admission
being charged. Others speculated as
to whether Grove City or West Lib-
erty.Teachers’ college will fill Ford-
har_n’s place on the Pitt grid card.

However, not long after reports of

the renewed grid relations ﬁltered .

from a downtown paper, rapid de-
nials came from both athletic depart-
ments. James Hagan, local athletic«
director, declared -‘.‘It is all news to
me; our code emphatically states that
we shall schedule no "team which does
not have an‘ equal chance of victory.’’

Class Drills on Cathedral Lawn

By Grace Proven

In the fall, as well as in the spring, the young man ’s fancy lightly
turns to the archery classes which are held on the Cathedral lawn.
Lovely coeds gather for class with their arrows, while their beaux
are drooped over the wall surrounding Lilly court. V

Comes the season for out-door archery, a sudden interest in the
techniques of the sport burns within the soul of the average Joe
College. He stands with mouth:
agape, and longing in his eyes, awed
by the collection of feminine Robin
Hoods.

Feigned trips to Carnegie Library,
something left in the car, or meeting
a Tech friend are frequently used de-
vices to get a close-up, perhaps a
smile (not even meant for the passer-
by) from the delicious freshman in
the blue sweater, or that smooth job
in green.

Sweet “hellos” to the one the spec-
tators have been. watching, may pro-
duce a once-over-lightly, but un-
doubtedly a glare will follow the
“wise guy” down the walk.

There is a rush for the seats near
the window in the classes held on
the Forbes street side of the Cathe-
dral, when the men students go to
class at all.

“Gee, Bob, what I wouldn’t give to
take HER to the Screwball Hop.”

“See that one with the bow in her

of those archery classes.

Pitt Players to Produce
Hart, Kaufmann Comedy

Whiteliill Sets Elmer
Rice Drama Tryouts

For Next Three Days

“You Can’t Take It with You,”
famous’ Broadway and Hollywood
production by George Kaufman and
Moss Hart, will come to the Univer-
sityas the latest addition to the Pitt
Players schedule, according to Buell
Whitehill, assistant professor of
English and director of the Players.

Tryouts for the second Pitt Players’

play, Elmer Rice’s “Counsellor at
Law,” to be presented December 7
and 8, will be conducted tomorrow,
Wednesday, and Thursday from 3 to
5:30 o’clock in 232 Cathedral.
, Reason for the addition of “You
Can’t Take It With You” to the sea-
son’s schedule, according to Mr.
Whitehill, is the success enjoyed by
the Players last season in their pro-
ductions “Our Town” and “Brother
Rat.”

It will be staged May 6 and 7.

Other shows which will be present-
ed include “Three Men on a Horse,”
by John Holm and George Abbott,
to be given November 2 and 3; and
“The Adding Machine,” by Elmer
Rice, scheduled for a March 14 and
15 showing.

Season tickets calling for three
plays can not be used for admission
to “You Can’t Take It With You,”
says Ada Urquehart, C40, chairman
of ticket committee.

New tickets for the four plays may
be purchased for $1.25, a saving of 40
per cent on the price of a single ticket
from members of the Players’ ticket
committee. who may be identiﬁed by
appropriate badges.

Individual tickets for the ﬁrst pro-
duction will not be on sale until an
estimate of season. ticket sales has
been reached. Joe Miller, E40, busi-
ness manager, advises students to buy
early in order to assure themselves

Players Take
Location Shots .
For Publicity

The Pitt Players were in a genuine
Hollywood whirl last Tuesday when
the cast for “Three Men on a Horse”
trooped over to the Hotel Schenley
for locale shots of the play. It was
the ﬁrst time any Pitt Players cast
had taken publicity shots on location.

Lee Ha.rter, C42, publicity manager‘
of the Players, donated his hotel
room for the shooting of the “bed-
room scene.”‘ The Players had an ap-
preciative audience in the hotel’s em-
ployees, who peered around doors
and viewed the goings-on with mut-
terings and headshakes. What they
saw were men in long underwear and
derbies posturing before the camera
in poses reminiscent of the hen-peck-
ed “Jiggs.”

The Schenley bar served for the
shooting of the barroom scenes. Staid
supper crowds at the hotel passed
through successive stages of aston-
ishment, bewilderment, and disbelief
as the derbied, checkered-vested,
slinky-gowned cast ﬁled through the
Schenley lobby in a haze of cigar
smoke dispersed by male members Of-
the cast. One member of the elite
peering through a lorgnette was
heard to remark, “Gee, ain’t dis a
joint!” '

Betty Weghorst, C41, carries the
feminine lead in “Three Men on a
Horse.” Jimmy McHale, C40, graces
the male part in the role of “Oiwen,”
and the “three men” are Sam Hamil-
ton, BA41; James Napier, BA39, and

of a seat.

Teacher

“It seems that the highest build-‘v‘
are the eleven-l

ings in Lithuania
story grain elevators which resemble
church steeples. A very ignorant
peasant, arriving in town for the
first time, noticed the tower and
asked a passer-by what the building
was. The passer-by answered, ‘Ele-
vator,’ and passed on. ‘Ah,’ said the
peasant, ‘elevator——it must be Saint
Elevator’s church!’ And he forthwith
went in to pray.”

This is what the Cathedral called
called to the mind of Dr. Kazys Pak-
stas, professor of geograpﬁhy at the
University of Vyautas-the-Great at
Kaunas, Lithuania. '
Lecturing Throughout Country

Stocky, bearded Dr. Pagatas, who
is lecturing to groups and schools all
over the country, visited the Cathe-
dral last Wednesday. He will be in
America until next September when
he will return to Lithuania. Last
summer he was at the University of
California at Los Angeles, where he

discussed “Current Problems in the,

Political Geography of Eurocpe.”

“American students are much more
practical and seem to be very busy all
the time. In Europe you will ﬁnd
more poets and philosophers in the
student body, and they really publish
their works. Then too, they do not
use ypewrters to such a great ex-
tent and the conditions of the Amer-
ican student’s notebook is much neat-
er and concise than that of the Eu-
ropean student.”

The prevalence of men dental stu-
dents struck the do-ctor as odd be-
cause in the European countries wo-
men dental students are more numer-
ous.

No Fraternities

Languages and mathematics are
emphasized more there than here,
and geology and geography are re-
quired in the high schools as part of
the regular curriculum. Military
training or physical education was
not compulsory when the doctor was
there last, but he was not sure about
the present situation.

Instead of fraternities, Lithuanian
students have what are called “Cor-
porations.” Corporations are formed
on the basics of ideology, origin, and
profession. Each‘ corporation has
about 25 members, each of whom”

wears the corporation’s cap and rib- .

bon across the chest. Dr. Pakstas
himself is the president of a corpor-
ation numbering about 800.

President of the Lithuanian Geo-
[graphical society, Dr. Pakstas is a

ciety, and an honorary member of the
Latvian Geographical society.

Tbday there are about 1,000,000

cigar stores, drug stores, country and grocery stores Where
you can buy cigarettes in the United States. These re-
tailers, and the jobbers who serve them, have built up
a service of courtesy and convenience unmatched by any other
industny catering to the American public’s pleasure.

THERE ARE ANOTHER MILLION people who
are engaged directly or indirectly in the transportation of
cigarettes to every town, hamlet and crossroads.

IT IS ESTIMATED that there are 1,602,000
tobacco farmers raising tobacco in 20 out of the 48
states. Good tobacco is one of the hardest crops to
raise and bring to market, requiring great skill and
patience from seed-bed planting to harvesting and cur-
ing. The modern tobacco farmer has done well the job
of constantly improving the quality of his product.

THE AVERAGE LENGTH of service of the 13,230
people Working in the Ghesterﬁeld factories, storage
houses, leaf-handling and redrying plants is over 10
years. This means that every step in the making of
Chesterﬁelds, regardless of how small, is handled by peo-
ple who have had 10 years of experience and ability in
knowing their jobs.

people live, work and achieve, and Chesterﬁeld takes
pride in its ever increasing part in this great industry that
is devoted entirely to the pleasure of the American public.
