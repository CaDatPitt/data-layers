 Donora Plague

~\:

 Key to Need for 
eHeaIth School

The new Pitt graduate
school of Public _Health will
combat disasters like the Do-
nora. plague that recently took
a toll of 19 deaths, according to

‘ University officials.
’ Newly appointed dean of the
A — school, Dr. Thomas Parran declin-

 -ed to comment on the cause of the

 deaths in the Men Valley mill

4' ,town but added that in'the .future

A.~¢- .

the school “will be interested in ‘

problems of thatsort . . . or com-

3 parable health problems.”

Dr. Parran said that the faculty

 and resources of the school would

  
    
 

"#1. do all inits power to make living

‘conditions better for residents "of
e} district by “making its serv-

thorities;” A ’
j Smoke Permanent Nuisance
, Opinion of residents in Donora

__,is that the deaths were caused by

 industrial smoke discharged by a
 ,znc mill. The sentiment was back-
”’, ed by a statement from authorities

»,

 that sulfur dioxide in the smoke

_ could‘ have led to formulation” of
irsulfuric acid droplets in the at-

? 'mosphere which are harmful to '

 health. ,
H, , _ .Pitt students from Donora de-

‘I ‘scribed the industrial smoke as a

_'= nuisance which has killed vege-
,{._:’cation in the town over a period-

 T of years.

‘_vf_-..',The condition has led to erosion,
. [lowered -property _ values, and
2 sﬂodds in homes bordering the
reroded Donora- hillsides.
_  New School Would Help
 ~‘ Another Pitt ofﬁcial, connected
v.iwith' the Mellon Institute, request-
I ged that his name be kept‘ from the
" records following an interview
' with News reporters. He said that
 concentrations of fumes, 20 times
'""'stronger' than the sample of air
.’ taken from Donora, have been ex-
’ perienced in the tri—state area.
. ' The new Pitt school will devote
if its research and educational fa-
cilities to their fullest extent to
- aidiworkers and residents of in-
 dustrial communities. Citing the
 I Donora episode as an example, Dr.
. Parran- expressed the desire to
, see the school develop into a
weapon against such disasters.

Ghestldnds Aid
War Victims

War—stricken\‘ European and
Asiatic college students will be
given a helping hand‘ by Pitt stu-
dents who contribute to the Pitt
Chest Drive next Wednesday.

The impoverished and under-
néurished students will receive the
"aid through the World Student
Service Fund,. an international or-
ganization designed to assist col-
leges and students in war—torn
countries.

The WSSF is one of the "seven
organizations, in addition to the

92 Communist Chest groups, aided
by the drive. ,
Under the fund’s program, stu-
dents from all over the world con-
tribute money which ,pays for
food, clothing, medical aid, books,
and equipment needed by the uni-
versities and their students.

An example of the extreme dif-
ﬁculties encountered by the for-
eign schools is furnished by the
University of Warsaw which was
95 per cent destroyed during the
war. Students" live in dugouts,
cellars, and huts. They lack food,
clothing, and ‘shelter and 35 per
cent have tuberculosis. Adequate
facilities are badly needed.

Abby Clark, chairman of the
Drive committe, urges all students
to contribute as generously as
possible to_.this and the other
groups, and adds, “We at Pitt
should realize how important edu-
cation is to foreign students in re-
constructing their countries. By
contributing to the fund we are
not only making a friendly gesture
but are also giving vitally-needed
aid to our fellow students.”

Pollers Wanfed

Students wishing to gain ex-
perience in polling methods
have "been asked to _ap_ply_at the
‘ground ﬂoor -student desk by
Nov. 17. Those accepted will
assist the Student Congress
polling‘ comimttee in sampling.

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

In these United States there is:
a species of character called the
salesman. There are as many dif-
ferent types as there are salesmen
but the most ferocious. of this
group is the type, door-to-door
salesman. He is determined, ten-
acious'and.vicious. Although he is
easy to identify, he’ is hard to
ﬁght and impossible to kill. Know-
ing that sooner or later you will
have occasion to meet this indi-
vidual, I feel it my civic duty to
educate you to this peril of the
modern community. I shall now
instruct on the handling, treating,
and ﬁghting of‘ this front porch
blight.

The other day, I was idling
around the house in my leisure
clothes, tee-shirt: and drawers,
when there was a sharp knock on
the ‘frontis portal. In a somewhat
graceful manner I peered through
the living room draperies and ob-
served a peddler. He stood there
young and ﬁne and straight, his
tam« at a rakish angle. Mistaking
him for Ronald Colman, a fruit-
vendor who lives next door, I
held the door wide and bade him
enter. “Do you mind if I come in?”
rhe asked, seating himself on a
sofa which just happened to be
in the kitchen. “No,” I breathed.
We sat there, he didn’t say a word.

Like Good Old Days

The smothering silence shatter-
ed as he asked, “Are you the man
of the -housé?,” with a smug, hy-
percritical “smile. Shamefacedly. I
acknowledged it. “You wear nice
drawers,” he added nervously. ‘I
thanked him in an off-hand man-
ner, spitting playfully into the air.
I could see that the company had
never instructed him on how to
sell whateverit was that he was
selling to a man -in drawers. My

“The sun will most. assuredly

“It will have to do a helluva lot

“What do you propose to do —

"‘I will concede, sir, that Rome

Truman's Stunning Victory p

President Harry S. Truman’s stunning victory had sage Pitt
students in an uproar Wednesday morning. ' -
One student interrupted the class lecture of Dr. Russell H.
Blackburn, head of the statistics department, to ask the ,doctor“i'i_i
he had an opening on the statistics staff for a fellow name of Georg

Gallup, who. it is rumored, is out of work. ;,_

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, head of the political science department,
pounded on his lecture table and '
demanded of his class, “Who, I
ask you, would have dared- to
prophisize that the Democrats
would win control of the House
of Representatives?”

“J. Howard McGrath,” piped a
voice from the back row. _

Philosophical political prognos-
tications were abundant and free
of charge in the Blue Tuck Shop,
gathering place of Pitt’s Kalten—
borns, Gunthers, Heatters, and

by attentive loafers, declared, “All

A black streamer of crepe paper;

In ain and Mud

BY BOB VAN ATTA

Determined practice sessions in mud and .rain——and under ~—

the lights——have prepared Mike Milligan’s Panthers for their

Ohio State date this Weekend. _ _
The varsity traveling squad, comprising 36

players, left

this morning for Columbus. They will hold a ﬁnal practice at

Ohio Stadium this afternoon.

Trainer Howard Waite ’s injury list has risen to four names
with the addition of right halfback Jack Smodic. Smodic, used
mainly on pass defense, pulledi muscle in the Western Re-

serve game last week.

He joins Don Fisher, regular
center, who was sidelined in the
Indiana contest, and Bill Bruno
and Tony Razzano, out for the
season.

Defense that will stop the three-
pronged Buckeye attack has come
in for considerable attention,
Stopping Jimmy Clark’s end runs,
Joe Whisler’s plunges, and Pan-
del Savic’s passes is something
none of the Bucks’ six previous
foesihave done.

The Pitt offense, after a leth-
argic weekend last Saturday, has
been hampered by a wet practice
ﬁeld. The turf for tomorrow’s con-
test will be. protected until game
time by a tarpaulin, Ohio State
oﬁicials reveal. _

Making the trip as Panther var-
sity members will be Leo Sklad-
any, Captain Bill McPeak, Nick
DeRosa, Earl Sumpter, Ted Ger-
emsky, and Bill Samer, ends; Nick
Bolkovac, Bob. Mihm, Bob Plotz,

twice and All-Suburban once.
Coatesville competes in two
leagues, Chester County and East-

The 6—foot, 195-pound center
indicates a preference for defens-
ive action. His ability in that re-

on nine pass interceptions during

By MYRON KOPELl\IAN _

Former athletic publicist Frank Carver has been Athletic Direc-
tor for four months now, and it is clear at this point that Carver
has not lived up to all that is expected of an executive.

There is no getting away from the fact that in several re-
spects Carver has been a ﬂop in making the switch from a sub-
ordinate job in the Athletic Department to the top executive posi-

tion.

In the ﬁrst‘ place, he does not _

know the ﬁrst thing about cross-
ing his legs and peering sternly
across his desk. He still clasps his
hands behind his head and looks
utterly common. . ‘
Secondly, Carver does not know
how to keep a visitor waiting in
the ante-room merely for the sake
of keeping him waiting. “I’ve got

A private secretary, a red plush
couch in his waiting room, and a
carpet on the office ﬂoor have, it
seems, failed to change the easy-
going, hospitable Mr. Carver. But
that does not mean he isn’t get-
ting his work done.

Carver, who is only an interim
director, is, however, brewing no
great reforms in the athletic de-
partment. “My job is simply to
maintain the status quo,” he ex-

« plains.

“That does not mean that our
teams will not improve. They’ll
get better without any big chang-
es or fuss. We’re going to continue
to schedule the best teams because
this is a great football town, and
the people want andgdeserve the
best. A C

“Of course, we’ve got to con-
sider the gate receipt angle if we
intend to maintain an adequate
athletic plant,” Frank went on.

when it’s your own, it’s a horse of a different color. So why
go through life with three stripes against you? A little Wildroot

“Why, it will cost approximate-
ly $50,000 this year just to keep
the Stadium in good shape. As far
as maintenance costs go, the Sta-
dium is rebuilt every 25 years.

“But our big reason for sched-
uling the major teams,” Carver
stressed, “is that people want good
football.”

Persons close to the 37-year-old
director do notexpect him to re-
main in hispresent position very
long. Frank is holding the fort

If Carver wanted the job per-
manently, you can bet that he _
would receive no little [considera-
tion. He is undoubtedly the most
popular man in the athletic ‘de-
partment today.

Radio Series
Sta rs Students

The speech department will be-
gin a series of weekly discussions
on station WPGH’s’ “Pathway to
Progress” program, Nov. 5.

“One Six Year Term For Presi-
dent” will be the subject for the

p. m. Friday. -

Mary Jane Boyle, Robert Chal-
fant, Dolly Lescinski, and Fred
Wolf comprise the initial discus-
sion group.

William“ S. Tacey, program
moderator, announced the second
and third discussion topics as
“Traffic Jams, How Can We Avoid
Them,” scheduled" for Nov. 12, and
“Should Pennsylvania Have In-
come Tax” for Nov. 19.

All students desiring to partici-
pate in the discussions Contact Mr.
Tacey in room 1315 C1.

ALTHOUGH FEW PEOPLE-
are aware of it, there is a jinx
afoot in the stadium this year. Not
a single. team wearing light—col—.
ored jersies has managed to win.
Pitt, West Virginia, and Indiana,
wearing white, went do-wn to de-
feat. It was gold that proved the
undoing of Marquette.

Panthers Face
‘Mad’ Bucks

(Continued from Page 1)
to beat down the Bucks, 21-7.

Among those beaten down was
the OSU touchdown-maker, Jerry
Krall. He may miss the Pitt game.
S_till the invaders will have to con-
tend with the jarring smashes of
Fullback Joe Whisler and the
sudden spurts of Halfback Jimmy
Clark.

Bucks in Good Shape

Krall was the only patient on
the sick list released by Buckeye
headquarters.

Respect, not pessimism, pervad-
ed the Pitt squad as they drill-
ed for this all—important tilt. Bob-
by Timmons, end coach, scouted
the Ohioans and spent the past
week indoctrinating the players
with the few ‘Buck weaknesses.

With only Center Donx Fisher
missing from the squad that left
this morning, Pitt, too, is in good
physical shape.

From present indications, the
Panthers will not be ‘playing be-
fore a wholly-partisan crowd. Sev-
eral thousand Pitt students and
thousands of other local followers
will bee—line for Columbus.
