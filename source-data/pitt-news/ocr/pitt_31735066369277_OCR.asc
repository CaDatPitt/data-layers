By FORREST BUFFENMEYER

Pitt News Staff Writer
Representatives from student organizations opposed an amendment

to the Student Government Board constitution yesterday that would
change the allocations process for the board’s seven governance

groups.

The’ SGB Judiciary Committee yesterday afternoon called a special

meeting of the board's Student Assembly on behalf of the Engineering

Student's Cabinet to register opinion on the amendment.

However, no representatives of the engineering cabinet were- in
attendance. Missing also were members of Black Action Society, the
Resident Students Association and the Nursing Students Association,
all groups which would be affected by the amendment.

Council meeting earlier this month, expressed surprise this evening
after learning engineering cabinet members, staunch supporters of the

Barb Klepcic, president of the engineering cabinet, could not be

Galanski, who chaired the meeting, cited several possible results if
the amendment were adopted. Using the 1978-79 SGB budget as an
example, he projected the following increases and decreases in next

year’s budget:
Decreases:

Pan-Hellenic Council,29 percent.
Increases:

Black Students Institute Escort System on Campus

Bv MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt's black students have
formed - an escort service for
women.

The service, which began func-
tioning Jan. 22, was established
“to provide the female students
with an escortduring the evening

hours for their protection while-

, traveling on and around the vicinity

of the campus,” according to a
ﬂyer prepared by an ad-hoc escort
committee of black students.

Steward E. _,Atwater, acting
chairman of the committee, said
the program was drawn up
“basically because of what hap-
pened to Monica Renee Jones.”

, Jones, a freshman, was raped
and strangled Jan. 3 in Tower A
dormitory.

“The escort system was estab-

lished to improve security,”
Atwater said, “We are not trying to
say. security is lax.”

Atwater added the service is an
effort to remove the burden of

Any female student in need of an
escort between the hours of 6:30

p.m. and 12 p.m. on weekdays can

call the Black Action Society office,
Atwater said, and a volunteer from
a black sorority will take the

woman’s name, place of departure.

and destination, and arrange for an
escort. —»

Two escorts will also leave
Hillman library every hour begin-
ning at 8 p.m. from the main desk,

and ‘will continue the service until
the library closes at midnight,
according to the committee’s
promotional ﬂyer.

Escorts are drawn from a list of
black fraternity members and other
volunteers, he continued. ‘

Upon ‘arrival, the escort will
present his identification card, and
when the woman arrives at her
destination she is required to call
the BAS office again to conﬁrm her
safe arrival.

/

“Any student can participate in i

the service,” Atwater said. “This
is for the university community,
not just for black students.
“Response has not been excel-
lent, but it has been used,” A

Atwater said in reference to thellr _

day-old-service. .
He stressed that students need
not be in the dormitories to
participate in the service. Escorts
are available to accompany stu-
dents to and from evening classes,
meetings, jobs, apartments, bus
stops, parking lotsand libraries.

Chinese-American Culture Preserved in Youth Course

By JOHN RIGHETII
Pitt News Staff Writer

When someone mentions Pitts-
burgh’s ethnicity, thoughts of
Poles and Slavs, Italians and
maybe Greeks come to mind. But
Chinese?

Yet Pittsburgh does have a
Chinese community; one that is
small but active and proud. So

. proud that it has its own school to

'\

teach its sons and daughters the
culture of their ancestors. '
Pittsburgh’s branch of the
nation-wide Organization of Chin-
ese-Americans sponsors the OCA
Chinese School each Sunday
afternoon from March through
October in the Cathedral. The
school teaches Chinese language

and culture to Chinese-American

children and anyone else interested
in them.

Despite the fact that there are
only 2,000 to 3,000 Chinese in
Pittsburgh, the school is one of the
largest Chinese schools in the
nation. -Last year’s program
involved 70 students ranging in age
from six to 14.

The school was founded three
years ago by Jaqueline Chu, then
program chairman for the organ-
ization and the school's current
principal. She got the idea from a
similar program at the University
of Wisconsin.

“They had this at the University
of Wisconsin and I decided it would
be a good thing to start here,” Chu
said. “We wanted something that

provided long range ‘involvement
for the children and this was it.”
When the organization decided
to establish the school, a place to
hold classes was needed. Pitt
solved both problems very easily.
“Pitt was very cooperative when
it came to providing us with the
rooms,” Chu said. “And most of
our teachers are graduate students
in Chinese or linguistics at Pitt.”
Outside of those capacities, the
school is independent and self-suf-
ﬁcient, funded by the organization
and small tuition payments from
its students.
~ The school teaches a variety of
courses dealing with Chinese
language and culture. The children
learn Mandarin Chinese, the
official language of Mainland.

China and Taiwan, and its writing
system using brushes. 0 Students
also can learn the concept of the
use of the abacus and Chinese
martial arts,such as kung fu.
In addition, they are taught
Chinese history through storytel-
ling and Chinese songs and dances.
Last year, the children performed
at the Pittsburgh Folk Festival.

,The majority of the children in i

the school are the children of

‘Chinese from both China and

Taiwan. The recent official
recognition of the People’s Repub-
lie of China by the United States
has not created any internal
squabbles or problems for the
organization or the school.

“There are no problems,” said

Chu. “We were founded as a
non-partisan group. Our interest is
in preserving our common Chinese
culture.”

The parents of the children are
pleased with the school and its
work. 1

“Many of the parents and thos
at‘ home are native speakers‘ of
Chinese,” Chu said. “The parents
want their children to learn the
language but have found individual
instruction at home difficult.
Group instruction is much more
effective.”

And the children enjoy it too.
But like all children, they have one
part of the school day they enjoy
most.

‘ ‘They really like playtime,’ ’ Chu
said.

Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi and Dan
Aykroyd) grind, scream and shout their way into
Blues history with their “Briefcase" album. It's a
rollicking raucas tribute to the root of rock ‘n’ roll
So says staff writer Sam Rossi,
who reviews the album, already a campus hit.
_,Also, entertainment editor Patty Tascarella take
a look at the rise of an actor not unlike John
Travo|ta’s. Richard Gere is hot off two movies
and 1979 already looks like a might fine year

Galanski also noted that student organizations not considered
governance groups would have their funding cut “by an excess of 200
percent.” — .

Several groups at the meeting expressed concern over these
projected ﬁgures, including the recently formed Pitt chapter of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).

Galanski reminded those attending the meeting that some members .
of more than one governance group might be represented as many as
four times in the allocations process, and consequently would receive a
ﬁnancial benefit.

The Judiciary will meet today to decide if a special election wil be
called to put the amendment up for a student body referendum. '

they felt should be added to the Student Union. The th ree top
items listed as priorities included a quiet study area, a bar, and

A Lack ~
  Of Participation

Yesterday a special session of the Student Assem-
bly was called by the Student Government Board’s
Judiciary. The reason: to discuss an amendment
that would raise funding for the SGB’s seven gover-
nance groups, allowing each organization atleast one
percent of student activities money. The result: the
amendment was all but killed due to a lack of atten-

representatives from the Engineering Student
Cabinet, the organization most responsible for the
proposal.

The engineers, along with unsuccessful SGB
presidential candidate Drew DiMaccio (also absent)
introduced the amendment to this campus during last
month’s campaign. After the meeting was over
DiMaccio said he was unaware it had even been
schedule and added that he “sympathized” with the
engineers if they too, were unaware of the special
session. We are not sure whether the engineers knew
about the meeting or not (It was advertised in Mon-
day’s Pitt News). -

Barb Klepcic, president of the engineering cabinet, .

was out of town, and SGB member Bernie Popko, a

staunch supporter of the amendment simply failed to’

show up. ‘ . ' .
A The real issue here is not whether the amendment
lives or "dies, but the fact that some organizations

' huff and puff their opinions around this university

but fail to back up their proposals through the legal

’ Friday, February 2, 1979-Page 6

the opinions of student organizations, and yet no one
seems to be paying much attention to it.

Too bad. The judiciary will meet next week to

decide if the amendment deserves a special election
later this term. If the annoyed looks of the ‘judiciary
nembers yesterday are any indication, the amen-
dment will probably be voted down. So, the overall
student body will never see a referendum. And if
engineers, or nurses want to complain about a lack of
funding next year, they would do best by confronting
their own leaders———not the allocations committee or
the SGB.

L proposal.

Representatives from the Nursing Student
Organization weren’t there, and they stand to get a
1,000 percent increase by implementation of the

amendment.

Most notable among the absentees, however, were

When the legality of the Pitt Union Program
Council was brought before the assembly last term,

, several campus leaders who criticized the council the
most failed to attend. With lack of student input and
help, the council has been all but.taken over by the

Office of Student Activities.

J onestown and American Society: Promises  

By‘MARGl STUMPF \

The mass murder-suicide in

. Jonestown, British Guyana last
’ November makes a much-repeated
comment on American society: it
» promises so much and delivers so
‘ little. '

' American history is littered with
tales of dilillusionedgpersons and
groups who have depended on
constitutional promises of liberty

and freedom equality to achieve

self-fullﬁlment and goals, only to
discover in their efforts that those

‘‘ attributes of democracy aren’t in

practice, and that the goals yhey

Q seek consequently aren’t within
» . reach.‘ ,
, P The Jonestown incident particul-

arly magniﬁes the gap between

- , promises made and promises

delivered because of the numberof
people--900 plus--involved in that

I  slaughter;

‘ Some of the rationalizations

if offered for the large, continuing

success of The People’s Temple
are: members had a conviction that
the sect was immortal and that
some of that immortality would be
passed onto its members; guilt was

installed to keep them in thesectl

‘ (non-members and defectors were
~“sinners”); leader Jim Jones had a

mesmerizing, sado-masochistic at-
traction; and members believed the
regimented, totalitarian lifestyle of
the Jonestown camp would cleanse
their souls. ~ A

But what these rationalizations
overlook is the prejudice inherent
in American society. The
overwhelming majority of Temple
membership was composed of
persons who fit into the American
mainstream like square pegs into
round holes. _

Many members were blacks who
saw a strange dichotomy at work in
the world, an idealistic emphasis

on equality existing side-by-side -

with the harsh reality of prejudice.
Blacks are the low men on the
totem pole. A ,
Some Temple members were
elderly. They, like the blacks,
found Americans to be more
concerned with norms; norms in
this case deﬁned by youth, physical
strength and attractiveness. Those
over 65 found that promises to
respect the elderly as equal, valued
and vital citizens had as much
worth as the American dollar.
Many members were blacks who
saw a strange dichotomy at work in
the world, an idealistic emphasis

on equality existing side-by-side
with the harsh reality of prejudice;
blacks are the low men on the

totem pole. ’
Consequently, most persons

attracted to the sect were those
who turned to what they saw as a
substantial ﬁller for the gaps in
their lives, an all-encompassing
devotion to God and religion.
Never mind that the Temple’s
promise of God was as pretentious

as the American Constitution’s‘

promises of freedom and equality

regardless of race, sex or age. At
least Jones was clever enough to
make invisible the discrepancy
between the religious fullfilment
his sect offered and the Jones-
geared existence he delivered.
Either Americans must be as
devious as Jones in presenting
democracy as gold(a cunning
toward which the mystique of
“being American and the myth of a
free-and-easy American lifestyle
has made great in-roads) or“ they
must make good their paper

promises. Efforts in the mid-1950s
and throughout the 1960s to put
into practice constitutional prom-
ises have proved to-be exercises in
futility. Civil rights movements
must soon become effective.

Otherwise, American society
faces a future which will be noted

for a socialenvironment conducive -

to the growth of escapist sects and
groups like The People’s Temple,
and for the tragedies that arise
from them. '

Briefcase Full of Blues
Blues Brothers
Atlantic

Jake Blues (John Belushi) grinds, screams and shouts
blues vocals amid cartwheels. He is joined by brother
Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) who, it is rumored, was born with a
harmonica protruding from his mouth. Their debut album,
“Briefcase Full of Blues,” is a rollicking, raucous tribute,
to the roots of rock ’n’ roll—-the blues.

Early trouble and run-ins with the law kept the brothers
from attaining their ultimate dream——performing. After
settling down, though, they began playing small clubs that
eventually led them to the big time.

if Their reputation grew rapidly. Soon, prominent
musicians like Tom Scott, Steve Cropper, Don Dunn and
Steve Jordan joined in to back up the brothers.

, “Briefcase Full of Blues” was recorded live at the
Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles.

The album opens with Otis Redding’s “I Can’t Turn You
Loose” and Floyd Dickson’s “Hey Bartender.”

Next is the brisk, funky, “Messin’ With the Kid.”

“Almost” is a Downchild Blues Band number that
features a dynamic horn section led by Scott and Lou
Marini.

Finishing side one is the hilarious “Rubber Bisquit” and

the powerfully moving “Shot Gun Blues.”

Side two begins with “Groove Me,” which features
J ake’s brief ﬂirtation with reggae.

“I Don't Know” is an up-tempo soul number that
showcases Elwood’s raunchy blues harp. ‘

“Soul Man” follows. This is the song that started the
Blues Brothers on the road to prominence and recognition.

Finishing up the album are “B Movie Box Car Blues”
and “Flip, Flopiand Fly.’ They are a couple of frenetic
pieces performed memorably by Jake.

As Jake says, “I suggest you buy as many blues albums
as you can.” And “Briefcase Full of Blues” is a great
album to start with. «

Love Beach
Emerson, Lake and Palmer
Atlantic '

Emerson, Lake and Palmer
achieved their greatest recognition
during the massive 1974 tour that
was done in conjunction with the
release of “Brain Salad Surgery,”
their ﬁfth album. That tour was
highlighted by Keith Emerson's

- revolving grand piano and the

headline bill at the first California
Jam.

At the end of the tour, ELP
released the triple disc “Welcome
Back My Friends To The Show That

I Never Ends, Ladies and Gentle-
. men——Emerson, Lake, and Palmer’ ’

live album which, like

“Yes-
songs”, is probably one of the most
deﬁnitive concert albums ever
recorded.

After that, the British trio faded
into quiet semi-retirement. Three
years later, in 1977, they released
the double album “Works, Volume
I,” followed by “Works, Volume
II” a few months later.

Of the four sides on “Volume
I," only one was done in the studio
by the entire group. This featured
“Fanfare For The Common Man"
and “Pirates.” The remaining
three sides were solo efforts, one
for each member. Likewise,
“Volume II.” was a collection of
solo efforts and only a couple group

Richard Gere a Magnetic Actor;
  Career Similarto Travolta’s

, By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Entertainment Editor

If 1978 was the year of John
Travolta, then 1979~is\the year of
Richard Gere. I

Gere ' starred in two films
released during the past year,
“Days of _ Heaven” and “Blood
Brothers,” that werelcritical, if not
commercial successes. ‘The former
has not come to Pittsburgh, but the
latter slipped into some second run

theaters for a short while in

December.
Gere has yet to enter the poster
concession, although. “Esquire”

(labeled him the beefcake king of

the pin-up crowd, While he is

sometimes given more credit for’

his looks than his talents as an
actor, Gere is a formidable screen
presence. \ ~

He started as a New York stage
actor and once play‘ed Danny Zuko,
the male lead in the Broadway
version of “Grease,” the first of
an ironic series of links\ with
Travolta, who played the role in the
recent film. ” _
Z Last year, Gere played Diane
Keaton’s psychotic boyfriend Tony
in “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” and
stole the picture. Despite the
character’s tough nature, there was
a sensitivity--a vulnerable side to
his personality that Gere revealed
with a gesture here and a reflective
glance there.

From there, Gere took on the role

Surgery,” which for some unknown
reason was never released with the
album of the same title.

The “Works" tour of late 1977
and early 1978 will be recalled as
the band’s effort to employ a 60
piece orchestra‘ as back-up for their
classically oriented shows. Things
got -expensive, however, and the
orchestra was dropped in mid-tour,
about five days before the trio’s
June appearance at the Civic
Arena.

ELP has now released their ninth
album, “Love Beach." The album
is a complete group effort,
including longtime friend and

unseen fourth member, songwriter

Pete Sinﬁeld, who collaborated on
all but two songs. . y ‘.

of Stony in “Blood Brothers.”
“Blood Brothers” is a story of
rebellion in a blue collar Italian-
American family. Like Travolta’s
Tony Manero in “Saturday Night
Fever,” Stony wants more out.of
life than the dull neighborhood and
construction jobs that his father
‘and uncle built their existence
around. ‘It is a typical tale about
generation clashes, but Gere gives
Stony a poignance that makes this
situation seem fresh. .
Travolta was originally slated to
play _Bill, a young drifter in"‘Days
of Heaven.” He backed out of the

picture to star with Lily Tomlin in
“Moment by Moment.” Director
Terence Mallick cast Gere in the
part.

In “Days of Heaven,” Bill and
his girlfriend Abby (Brook Adams)
pose as brother and sister as they
work as ﬁeld hands during the
Depression. They are hired by a

, wealthy farmer who is dying of a
mysterious illness. ~
The farmer falls in love with
Abby and .Bill encourages her to
marry him, reasoning that the man
will not live long and then they can

in an Italian-American family.

Emerson, Lake and Palmer Back Again

The first five songs of side one
are all Lake/ Sinﬁeld compositions.
“All I Want Is You,” the title track,
“Love Beach,” “Taste Of My
Love” and “The Gambler” are fair
at best but not really up to par.

“For You” is undoubtedly the
best’ ‘ ‘single’ ’, a hauntingly beauti-
ful love song featuring strong lyrics
and singing by Lake and excellent
keyboard work by Emerson.

“Canario” (from “Fantasia Para
Un Gentelhombre”) closes the first
side. It’s an instrumental piece
true to form—multisynthesizers
covering the entire spectrum of
sound at the touch of Emerson's
ﬁngers on the keyboards.

Side two, titled “Memories Of
.An Officer and A Gentleman,” is

In a scene from Blood Brothers,” Richard Gere plays a rebeliiots son

the work of Emerson and Sinﬁeld.
It’s another ELP full side epic in
the same vein as “Tarkus” and
“Karn Evil 9.” The first three
numbers subtitled “Prologue/The
Education Of A Gentleman,”

“Love At. First Sight,” and
“Letters From The Front," tell the
pessimistic story of a man destined
for war. “The piece closes with
“Honourable Company (A Mar-
ch)", another instrumental key-
board number by Emerson.

“love Beach” is not the best
work ever done by Emerson, Lake
and Palmer. It is, however,
certainly an attempted return to the
standards set before “Works.”
The album is well arranged, the
trio once again tight.

Ray Charles Biography on Honest Reflection

By GARY BRADFORD

/Pitt News Staffwriter
Brother Ray:
Ray Charles’ Own Story
By Ray Charles and David Ritz
Dial Press

Listen to Ray Charles’ singing
and hear anguish and joy alter-
nating in every bar. In his recently
published autobiography, Charles
graphically recounts his personal
and professional lives.

How does a blind man see the
world? Much more honestly than
the sighted, according to Charles.

“Looking back, I couldn’t see
anything that needs to be censored.
There was no reason not to be
straight...ain’t no taking it back. I
can’t turn it around, and don’t want
to,”_ he writes.

Charles recalls the tiniest details
from his Georgia childhood, but he
devotes the most space to the
blindness that struck at age six.

The ordeal is told without self-pity
and even humorously at times.
Sometimes, he makes blindness
seem as if it were the best thing
that could have happened to him.

The book's language is rough
and raunchy, just like Charles’
vocalizing. Charles is very critical
when he discusses his heroin
addiction, but he apolo'gizes for
nothing.

“I didn’t quit because the heroin
was killing me--maybe it was,

maybe it wasn’t--but because it
was going to bring down my family
and maybe even cause me to rot
away in some jail cell," he said.

Besides the tragedies, Charles
provides colorful looks at the black
music world. Whether in back-al-
ley bars or Carnegie Hall, he makes
it clear that the musician’s life is
riddled with unscrupulous promot-
ers, exploitive contracts and public
ignorance.

  Panthers, Clancy Control Duquesne in 89-83 Win

 Puts Up Its Dukes,
P 10,205 Watch Thriller

By CRIS HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s unpredictable Panthers,
who had not won in an opponent’s
gym during the season’s ﬁrst 17
games, journeyed just a few miles
along Fifth Avenue last night to
tangle with Duquesne. And much
of the thrilling game that resulted
resembled a hazardous road these
Panthers had travelledbefore.

But Tim Grgurich’s team took a
new turn near the - end of last
night’s game, using foul shots to
fuel their late drive toward an 89-83

win before a boisterous Civic Arena
crowd of 10,025.

Each team played well. Three
Panthers‘ and a pair of Dukes
performed extraordinarily well.
And when victory hung within each
team’s reach, the Panthers’ Sam
Clancy grabbed it for Pitt.

The game nearly always was
close. Though Duquesne several
times grabbed leads that reached

as many as nine points,t he teams
more often were two or three points
apart, trading baskets and dazzling

plays.
The result of 38 minutes of
basketball was an 83-83 tie.

Pitt, with Sam‘ Ellis on the bench
because of his ﬁve fouls, decided to
hold the ball when it gained
possession with two minutes
remaining. The Panthers (10-8)
scored the game’s ﬁnal six points
from the foul line during those
minutes and thus earned their ﬁrst
close win of the season.

“I guess we were just supposed
to win this game,” said Clancy,
whose 23 points and 13 rebounds
paced a Panther effort much’ aided
by a three-quarter court zone press
through much of the game.
“They had a hot hand at the start
(the Dukes shot 63 percent from the
ﬁeld when they took -a 46-41
halftime lead) but we pulled this
one out at thekend.”

“We had enough of those games
in which we did not take control at
the end and paid for it,” said guard
Carlton Neverson, whose baskets
twice allowed Pitt to tie Duquesne
(at 81 and 83). _

Ellis matched Clancy’s 23 points
for the Panthers, who also received
20 from Terry Knight and 14 from
Neverson. But though the
Panthers’ front line produced 66
points, Pitt’s guards especially
Neverson—contributed substan-
tially to the win.

Bruce Atkins and B.B. Flenory
provided much of Duquesne’s
scoring. Atkins, a 6-7 freshman
who went head to head and elbow
to elbow with Clancy much of the
night, gave the Dukes 25 points
and 12 rebounds. Flenory’s
stirring shooting provided Du-
quesne, 10-7, with 24 points.

Pitt’s press occasionally offered

‘Duquesne an unfettered path

toward an easy ﬁeld goal, but more
often it harried the Dukes and
allowed Pitt to dictate the game’s
style. ‘

Sammie Ellis scores two of his nine field goals.

“We practiced that press a
whole lot,” Neversonisaid. “It
broke down a couple of times, but
in the end it worked.”

‘Clancy ‘stole the ball ﬁve times,
usually at opportune instances.
Knight and Ellis each were
successful thiefs twice.

“We busted "em,” said Ellis,
who was charged with his ﬁfth foul
at 6:43 of the second half, when the
teams were tied at 73. “We were
up tonight and we’ll be up more
next ti-me we play them (at the
Field House Feb. 17).”

Pitt’s hopes appeared to dim
when Ellis left the game and
Clancy committed. his fourth foul 12

seconds later. “But I knew Sam
could do it when I left,” Ellis said,
though Clancy was opposing a
‘strong\Dukes inside game. “And
he did it. I just give him some extra
strength when I’m in there.

“But that man is Sam Clancy no
matter who else is around.”

“I was concerned when Sammie
left,” Clancy said. “You have to.
remember that Terry Knight had
four fouls and Duquesne has some
good players near the basket.”

But Clancy rose to the challenge
several times by rising above a
crowd to grasp an important
rebound or a loose basketball.

“We really believe our inside

. game is one of the best in the

East,” said Grgurich, for whom
West Virginia (tomorrow night at
the Field House, 8 p.m.) will be the‘

100th opponent he has faced as

Pitt’s head coach.

But because they dodged ‘foul
trouble well enough to produce 66
points and split the evening’s
rebounds evenly with the Dukes,
Pitt’s players encountered" little
trouble when it could have been
most expected last night.

“We are the better team and we
proved that here tonight,” Clancy

said. “And when they come to the "

Field House we're going to prove it
to them again.” -

7 ‘me llonible Hankie’ No Match
For Pitt’s Bubble Gumchann

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

Duquesne fans are sometimes
crude, always vocal but, in some
cases, not very original. The
creation of junior college transfer
Bill Clarke’s “Doctor’s Office” was
one of the Duke students better
efforts this season but they should
have walked away from the pro-
verbial drawing board and left well
enough alone.

Copying the Steelers’ Terrible

‘Towel, Duke fans sported “Hor-

rible Hankies” last night at the
Civic Arena.

Just as Duquesne proved to be
no match (well, at least last night)
for the Pitt Panthers in basketball,
the charms of the Horrible Hankie’
were ineffective against the magic
of Sam Clancy’s Bubble Yum.

Coach Tim Grgurich sat at the
broadcasters’ table following the
Panthers’ satisfying 89-83 victory
against Pitt’s cross-town rival,
accepting congratulations and
chewing some of the.bubble gum
that did in the combined efforts of

the hankie, Mossie Murphy, the
Doctor’s Ofﬁce and the tuxedoed
Duquesne Duke. *

This was not the ﬁrst-game

"Grgurich had chewed bubble gum,

but it was certainly the most
opportune.

“Sam (Clancy) was just one
beautiful basketball player to-
night,” Grgurich said. “He just
went out and played the kind of
inside game we needed. Sam’s one
player who has to play the whole
game.

“He is strong enough to play the

whole 40 minutes and tonight we
just could not afford to take him out
to give him a rest. We just prayed
he wouldn’t get into foul trouble.”

Clancy, the only player on either
team to play the entire game
without a rest, wound up his “Slam
Bam Sam” road show with 23
points and 13 rebounds.

After the game he explained his
performance: ‘‘In the locker room
before the game, I had a couple of
packs of this gum and just started

passing it around to the other

guys.”  ~-

The 6 foot, 6 inch center grinned,
then added, “Yea, we had Bubble
Yum, but we won the game
because we were ready for
Duquesne.”

They were ready, willing and
able.
Panthers were once again under-
dogs, an Eastern Eight win was not
the only prize at stake. There was a
matter of pride at work here.

Duquesne did a fine job of
recruiting last spring, and many
believed the best collegiate team in

«Pittsburgh resided on the Du-

quesne bluff. Despite an unusual
show of emotion by both squads,
however, the annual Civic Arena
ﬁghts did not occur and the
Panthers emerged with both hides
and pride intact.

Duquesne coach Mike Rice said,
“They (the Pitt players) busted
their tails; that’s probably the
difference in the “ game. ’ ’

That and maybe a little help from
the Bubble Yum.“

In a game where the

Wrestlers Can't Win Close Bouts, Fall tolclarion, 25-13

ByJIMLEWIS
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team just
couldn’t win the close bouts in a
25-13 Eastern Wrestling League
loss to 12th-ranked Clarion Wed-
nesday night. ’

“We lost the close matches and
that is what we can ’t afford to do,”
Panther head coach Dave Adams
said. “At 126, 150, 158, Clarion has
got some tough kids, but you have
to ﬁgure we’d win those.”

Pitt only had three victors. Glenn
Maxwell, 118 pounds, earned his
third consecutive pin at the
expense of Ray Wade at 1:55. Skip
Bollin, 167 pounds, super-deci-
sioned Dan Strawn, 13-5 and Jim

Gordon decisioned Eric Booth, 5-1,
in the 177 pound match.

But it was in the 126, 150, 158
pound bouts, where there were
close matches that could have gone
either way. Unfortunately for Pitt,

those went the Golden Eagle's
way.

Clarion’s Tom Diamond edged

“Ed turned in a gutty perfor-

“But I’m disappointed. We honest-

practices this week.”

According to Sanft, Pitt’s
primary objective will not be to
actually win the meet, but to run up
a team score of 132 points.

“That will be an improvement
over last week’s and also be our
highest score of the season so far,”
she said.

Clarion’s lineup boasts several
nationally-ranked individuals, ac-
cording to the coach, including
sophomore Nancy Jones. ..o...:s
was an all-American last season
and placed eighth in the all-around
competition at nationals.

Another standout for the Eagles
is Ann Woods, a freshman who,
according to Sanft, “has been
doing a fantastic job.” Woods
reportedly already has scored a
9.65 in the ﬂoor exercise this
season.

Pitt will rely on Bonnie Tressler
and Holly Martino, who placed
one-two in theall-around competi-
tion against Michigan State. Also
competing for the Pantherettes will
be Dawn Reimer, Myra Bachuchin,
Diane Debich, Roxanne Evans,

.well, the coach said.

  Face Ranked Competition

Alison Hoburg, Cindy Solyan and
Karen Zandi.

Bachuchin, Evans and Hoburg
normally compete all-around for
Pitt, but due to injuries, they will
see limited action. .

“We want to have those thre
healthy for the regionals,” said
Sanft, “so we can’t take any
chances. We’re hoping that they'll
be back next week against Slippery
Rock.”

Injuries are also a factor for the

,men’s team, as one Panther, Ken

Luns, will not compete at all due to
a dislocation and torn ligaments in
his ﬁnger. Teammate Allan
Meyers is sufferingwith a "wrist
injury, but will compete.

“Al will only be at about 50
percent,” said coach Frank
D’Amico,” but that 50 percent will
be well worth it for the team.”

According to D’Amico, Temple is
a strong team, more so than last
year. But Pitt has also improved.

“It will be a tight. meet—a nip
and tuck battle,” he said.

“To crack the top 20, we’ll have
to score 200 points or better,” he
said. “We’ll need strong
performances from everyone.”

Pitt will count on a strong
performance from Bob Besong who
is hoping for a score of 50 pointsin
the all-around, the elite score
ofmen’s gymnastics, according to
D’Amico.

Team captain Doug Smith and
Cem Akisoglu should both score
“They are
both beginning to get their routines
‘together and should score well,”
he said.

D’Amico concluded, “Temple
has a slight edge overall, but if we
could’ possibly take the floor
exercise and win the sidehorse, it
could give us enough momentum to
win the meet.” '

WANDA RANDOLPH

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s basketball team
was unable to solve any problems
that have been plaguing it as the
Pantherettes fell to their third
straight defeat Wednesday night at
Edinboro by a score of 69-54.

The Pantherettes found them-
selves in foul trouble throughout,
with captain Robin Fry having to
leave the game with nine minutes
remaining to be played.

Pitt turned the ball over 35 times
by the end of the game, allowing
the Scots to dominate the scoring.
“Our 35 turnovers were a decisive

shooting very well,” said coach
Jean Balthaser. “We were trying
to force the action on offense

factor in itself because we weren’t.

  Scots! |t’s Edinboro,69-54.

instead of being patient and

working the ball.”

To add to the Pantherettes’

problems, Edinboro was having a
great night, led by a 30-point
performance from Lori Dolby one
that Balthaser labeled “the story of
the game.”

“The entire Edinboro squad
was always hot,” said Balthaser.
“Dolby had 25 points in the first
half alone. She was unbelievable,
shooting 12 out of 14 from the
ﬂoor,”

Leading the Pantherettes once
again in scoring was center Wanda
Randolph with 17 points, followed
by Stephanie Stripling with 11 and
Fry with 10. Randolph was high in
rebounding for Pitt, pulling down
22.

  

Wanda had a nice game, playing
really well off the boards,” said
Balthaser.

Despite the fact that Pitt has won
half of its last four games and the
two losses were to nationally-
ranked teams, Balthaser believes
that the team showed some
regression against the Scots.

“We played well and we played
together in our last four games, but
we made a poor showing against
Edinboro,” said Balthaser. “We
regressed against Edinboro.
Things that we were doing well in
the past we weren't doing well
against the Scots.

“The answer for us will be in the
next two weeks,” said Balthaser.
“We must win and win big.”

  Runners Take Invitational Track This Weekend
, Women Host Their Own

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s third annual women ’s track
and ﬁeld invitational will be held
this weekend at the Fitzgerald
Field ‘House. , 1

Besides the hostess Panther-
ettes, 28 teams are entered,
including Eastern powers Mary-
land, Penn State, and Georgetown.

The meet starts tonight at 7 p.m.
and continues throughout tomor-
row (10 a.m. starting time).

Favored are defending champion
Michigan State, runnerup Mary-
land, and Ohio State, which won its
own invitational several weeks ago.

Michigan State. has wqn the

championship for the past two
years,

but probably will be
dethroned by Maryland, which
according to Pitt coach Alfreda Goff
has “a better balanced team.”

Meanwhile, Goff expects her
team to at least duplicate last
year’s sixth-place finish.

“We’re stronger this year than
we were last,” Goff said. “Last
year, this invitational waslour. ﬁrst

meet of the season. This year, we ‘

already have competed twice
(against Penn State and in the Ohio
State Invitational), so we have an«
idea of what's going on and what

we can expect from our team. ‘

“We also have more experience
under our belts,” added the
Pantherette coach. “Many of our

girls last year were freshmen. This .

year, we have a nice blend of both

freshmen and sophomore.”
Pacing the Pantherettes, who

placed sixth at this year's Ohio

State Invitational, will be freshman I

Peri Jude Radecic, shot put; Gwen
Murray, 220-yard -run; Leslie
Palmer, hurdles; * and both the
880-yard and one-mile relay teams.

Radecic, in her first two
collegiate meets, has twice
smashed the team record in the

. shot put.

Both she and Murray so far are
undefeated in their events.

most likely think of the site of one

Relays.

The Pitt track team will make the

weekend to participate against
some of the finest track athletes in
the country- The Panthers made a
