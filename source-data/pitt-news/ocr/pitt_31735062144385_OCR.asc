Let’s Be Democratic;

See The Other Side

By Jim Pettican 9

Illustrative of how much harm
a little superﬂuous knowledge can
do is a recent mouthing by Walter
Winchell, The Blue Network’s
sen:sation—seeking “commentator.”
On Sunday Evening April 29, Mr.
Winchell made the following state-
ment on his radio broadcast:

“According to documents and
photostats in my pockets now,
an American organization has or-
dered a loving cup for German
prisoners of war in the United
States. You .heard me. That’s what
I said—a loving cup! The Inter-
national ”YlMlC=A ‘War Prisoner’s Aid
has ordered an engraved loving
cup t-o be given to the Nazi pris-
oner of War team winning the
soccer championship at Camp
Clark, Missouri. I have a sug-
gestion, to make. T-he presentation
should be made before an audi-
ence of Gold Star mothers and
widows and the orphans of victims
in German Conc-en-tration camps.”

With the country at it’s present
high feverpitch over German.
atrocities, this statement of half-
truth deliveredin typical scream-
ing Winchell fashion, has been
more damaging to the Interna-
tional YMCA than a complete
falsehood might have been.

A glance at the other side of
the picture reveals that the an-
swer to Mr. Win-chell’s charge
is yes—but, and the but encom-
passes a lot of ground. that the
Jergens Journalist failed to cover
in his search for the facts in the
case-—if he bothered to look for
any at all!

‘First of all, it should be made
clear that the work among the
war prisoners is carried on by
the World’s Committee of’ the
YMCA from its headquarters in
Geneva, Switzerland under the
terms of the Geneva convention.
This work is performed in every
country throughout the world
Where there are war prisoners
and its beginnings may be traced
back to around the time of the
American Civil War. The Interna-

tional Committee of the Y-MCA is

an American organization which,
along -with -other national Y‘MCcA
movements is responsible for ob-
taining the ﬁnancial support re-
quired.

Secondly, the questions pro-
vvoksed by the broadcast emphasize
the needfor an understanding on
the part of American citizens of
the reciprocal nature -of all serv-
ices ,to prisoners of war. During
the past two years, War Prisoner’s
aid of the YMCA has sent to
American Prisoners] of War in
Germany huge quantities of sports
articles, musical instruments, and
books, together with large quanti-
ties of hobby, handicraft, and
dramatic supplies.

This service to American prison-
ers of war in Germany would not
be possible except for the fact that
the War .Prisoner’s aid of the
YMCA has been providing a sim-
ilar service for German prisoners
in the United .States. Thus it may
be seen that the principle of
reciprocity is the basis and na-
ture of all of this work.

‘The cup in question is typical
of the thousands of trophies made
available by the YMCA toipris-
oners all over the world to stim-
ulate their interest in sportsman-
ship, athletics, education, ﬁne arts,
and similar activities. American
prisoners in Germany have been
warm in their praise of the
morale-building values: of these
trophies and awards. Calling the
cup a “loving cup” was rather an
unfortunate designation on Mr.
Winche1l’s part as it is merely
a small trophy about five inches
high and has been described by
the commanding ofﬁcer as being
worth about $2.50, which would
-seem to make it a rather inex-
pensive sort of article to say the
least. The YMCA states that Ger-
man prisoners in the U. S. have
voluntarily contributed more than
twenty thousand dollars in the
last few months to help defray the
expenses of the YMCA service to
all war prisoners. Moreover, Ger-
man prisoners in the United States
pay for m-ore than two thirds of

According to a report from

within Germany to the Provost_‘j.;”:
Marshall «General in Washington, . s:
D. 'C., our treatment of war prisv ‘ '

oners has been our greatest
propaganda in this war. The re-
port states in part: “German

Prisoners in America write thou-. ’

sands of letters to their families
in Germany and this is America’s
greatest propaganda weapon and
is having a decided inﬂuence upon
the course of this: war.

A Before deliberately provoking
public resentment by the «state-
ment he made, ‘Mr. Winchell
should have read the editorial in
the Cleveland Press of April 27,
1945, which says in part: “The
Geneva Convention is about the
only civilized thing that has been
salvaged out of this war. If we
throw it overboard in our revul-
sion against the Germans and the
Japanese, we get down into the
gutter with them. Following
which, we revert to savagery with
the seed of light.”

 .Panthers End Drills

With Ice Cream Party

By Larry Bondy

-  Dr. -Carlson and his 12 proteges

ended their '8-day spring training
with an ice cream party. The

 Ggarlsbn-coach~ed outﬁts have al-
 had the reputation of being

tl'_1‘;é;.’ice cream eaters in the bas-
kéf-ﬁloall world and the do-ctor hop-
 ‘to leave the (boys with that
thqught over the summer.

s "?e colorful Pitt coach put the
stu outs through a on-e-hour prac-
tice each day, at which time he
demonstrated his :fast offensive

branti of ball. “The best offense

is a good defense” and that’s just
what the doctor has in mind. The
boys are taught to weave in and
out and be in the right spot at
the right time; perfect timing and
coordination makes the continu-
ity work. Not one, nor two, but
three continuities are what the
participants learn-ed in these ses-
sions, Where, as all last season,
Pitt played with one continuity.
Along with the three continuities
are 30- plays. The ﬁgure 8 con-
tiniiit-y is the most famous and

- has gained recognition in all of

the «states of the Union. The play
-.r'e‘sejn‘ibles the ﬁgure 8, with the
uﬁﬁh always cutting through the

_ 

-Four veterans from last year’s
 squad engaged in the pre-
 work-outs. Nate Apple, Ed
Gafnham, Morrie Ja-colbsen and

Ed Marazevski. Marazevs-ki was

one of the lat-e comers to last
year’s squad because of football
practice. In his few appearances
in the line-up he managed to
make a couple of fbuckets each
time. Big Ed showed signs of de-
veloping into .a good ball player
in the Westminster rout on the
Stadium floor, when he was put
into service after the expulsion
of Hank Zellers and Morrie Jacob-
sen. Other former basketball play-
ers out for the squad are Haller,
and Arnie Sarrett, both students
enrolled in the Dental School.
Haller played varsity (ball at the
University of Pennsylvania and
North ‘Carolina, while Sarrett
played at Long Island U.

Some new faces -out of the 1945
Panther edition are Bob Schia-ch,
Howie Beck, Ish Schafer, Joe Pol-
lack and Richard Adler. Pollack,
Beck and Adler had no high
school experien-ce while the other
charges have had some experi-
ence in faster competition.

Dr. Carlson deems this short
training period a great success and
-believes the boys have covered
-more, super-ﬁcially, in this time
than they -did all last season. If
the summer enrollment contains
any ball players and enough stu-
dents who wish to try out for the
team, a summer practice session
will be scheduled for July.

ONIONS T0 OHIO STATE

Massillon’s Mauler, Paul Brown, has again hit the h.ead-A

lines. This time the former Buckeye coach is ufeuding with his-
old employers. While on leave in the Navy, Lt. Brown signed‘
to coach at Cleveland team in the All-American Conference, L,a_
newly formed play—for—pay outﬁt. Now the Ohioans charge the
ex-Big Ten coach with signing a boy who played for the Scarlet‘
Scourge freshman squad back in 1942. School ofﬁcials claim
that the youngster professed his intention to go back to the

Columbus college when he returned from the service. It’s a. .

prettty ﬂimsy argument. .

Whom are the colleges trying to kid?

The pros can ﬂip this right back in the faces of those who
denounce Paul Brownifor his grabbing tactics. There was a
pretty fair country ball player who went to one ofthe small.
Pennsylvania schools for a year and then dropped out. Well, it
the midst of this player shortage, one of the teams in the Na-
tional League approached him with enticing terms and he ten-
tatively accepted. That was last winter. This spring he wrote

-"the topic of discussion will be the

“Deacon of the Drums,” Gene
Krupa., As a matter of fact, at
one time Gene was enrolled at St.
Joseph’s college in Rennselaer, In-
diana, studying to be a priest.
Born in the “Windy City” thirty-

". six years ago, he made his ﬁrst

debut as a “skin-beater” when he
was thirteen. The group that he
played for wasn’t a very impress-
ive organization. The name of the
band was the Frivolians, who were
playing a dime-a-dance stand at
Wisconsin Beach. It was when
Gene saw Benny Goodman playing
with Ben Pollack’s band the same
summer, that he decided upon be-
coming a professional drummer.

After dropping out of college he
signed up with‘ Joe Kayser’s
orchestra in Chicago. Later on he
went out on the road as an itiner-
ant drummer, occasionally play-
ing with midwestern outﬁts.

Krupa started hitting big time
in 1929, when he joined Red
After -three years
of beating them for Red, he tied
up- with Irving -Aaronson and his
Commanders, whom he soon left to
play with Mal Hallett. In 1934 he
went over permanently to Benny
Goodman, recording some of his
best records during that time. The
one which won him fame was
“Sing, Sing, Sing,” in which he

S plays continually for close to ten

minutes. Finally Gene organized
his own band which included such
great performers as Roy Eldridge

_ .f_on; trumpet, Myff Mole on the
‘trombone, and Jess Stacey on the

ivories. With this combination,
together with his own abilities, the
group hit big time success easily.

Dress is a big thing with Mr.
Krupa. At one time he was
known to have more than forty
hand-made, water-proof suits. In
fact all of his clothes, including
underwear, are hand-made and
water-proof. If they weren’t so,
after each performance he would
be required to get an entirely new

Mr. Krupa has deﬁnite ideas on
jazz. “Not that the good jazz tu-ne
has gone,” says Gene. “It’s still
a big thing—but at least sixty
per cent of the music band’s play

‘today should be fashioned for
dancers. I believe that the best
thing brought out ‘by swing and
its great popularity was the stress
put upon a good solid rhythm or
beat. Drummers and rhythm men
shouldn’t bury the tune-—they
should play it melodiously. On
many tunes which my band plays,
we stress ballad work and pretty
harmonies to the exclusion of ex-
tensive solo work by instrumental-
ists, the rhythm section blending
into the melody as much as the
reeds and brass.”

 
 

There will be a meeting for
all persons who expect to en-
roll for student teaching either
the first or second semester of
1945-1946 in Room 208 CL,
Wednesday, May 9 at 3 p. m.

Hook, Line, and Sanker
By Tillie Sanker
Most people like to write from
personal observation. This week
Sanker will describe some things
she’s never seen.
A student without an alibi,
A sailor without that look in
his eye.
A professor without a well-ﬁlled
portfolio,
And (lately) a piece of bread
without oleo.
An anonymous letter not signed
Roger,
A good—looking girl whom Bill
Humes,won’t bother.
A class without at least one late-
comer,
A park without couples in the
summer. V
A column without a concluding
line,
So here ’tis, and bye, ’till next
time!
If this is too bad, then . . .

Since we have been convinced
that there -will be at least six
steady readers for this column,
your reporters again take up the
rusty pen and try to scratch out

some -more npropaganda for you,

our unfortunate readers. First of
all, we must -clear the desk of all
our fan mail received in the past
week. In answer to many who
requested it, we will send you
our autographed photograph by
return mail. Now we move on to
more important news. A very con-
troversial subject has been pla.gu-
ing _‘'both. the engineers and the
Engineering and Mines cafbinet
since the beginning of the year.
One of the aims o.f the cabinet for
the school year ’44-45 was the re-
opening of the Engineers’ lounge.
The realization of this aim took
place -during the Christmas vaca-
tion. The University vacated room
3, State. hall, to make room for
the lounge again. The cabinet fur-
nished the room with soft, com-
fortalble leather chairs and couch-
es, had the walls washed and the

gﬂoor polished. When the engi-

neers returned to school on Jan-
uary 2, they were greeted with a
bright, airy, well-furnished lounge
in which to spend their free hours.
At once this became the focal
point for the engineers. The engi-
neers again had a place to hang

7

‘Don’t the engineers really want

their hats and loaf. Yet, as time
passed the number of fellows
using the loung-e began to dwindle.
Nowadays the lounge is empty,
far too often. What’s the reason?

the lounge? How can the situa-
tion "be remedied? These are but
a few of the questions that have
stumped the E and M cabinet.
Sam Parks is having Thaw hall
engine laboratory redecorated
with a refrigerator unit, a small
«boiler plus accessories, and a gas-

 

oline distrilbution unit. Mr. Parks
announces and your reporter
quot-es, “Well, foist we is gonna
knock out de back wall, den we
is gonna jack up de ceiling a
coupla feet, -gonna slap in a couple
or t’ree portitions, and den (with
big greasy smile) we is gonna
have an open house with free
beer.” It all sounds just “too”
good to be true.

“Beekin Deacon” Wells, ME, ﬁn-
ally got his presidential appoint-
ment to-——no, not to West Point,
just a plain old army ca-mp. The
engineering school’s loss is the
Navy’s gain as Armand Zitelli,
crack  student entered the
Navy as a radio technician. Also,

ME. sports, better known as
“ehallengng Ralph” was wrestled
