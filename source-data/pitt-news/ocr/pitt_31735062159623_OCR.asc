Maher Named

As Democrat

Don Ewart, a former Pitt marsh-
all who posed as a Democratic
leader for more than a year, has
branded a prominent student poli-
tician a card-carrying member of
oftthe Democratic Party.

Now urfider subpoena to the Men's
Council Cathedral Un-Pitt Acti-
vities Committee, Ewart just yester-
day revealed himself as a pseudo.
Democrat investigating Democratic

infiltration at Pitt.

In testimony before the committee
today, the debonair Ewart told
probers how Ray Maher, 23, a pre-
law senior» and president of the
tt IF‘ Council, has been

 

.of men. The report showed that
14 all-school dances in the last
three years have lost money com-1
pared to only seven which pro-
fired.

The almost $3,000 loss has been
carried by the profits by the 1948
Military Ball and the 19-47 Spring
Festival Main Ball, according to
Mr. Saalbach.

"We must look at these dances
realistically, for there are no more
big profits,” he said.

He pointed to the financial and
social success that the Engineer-
ing and Mines Association has with
its dances as proof that it can be
done.

“But Pitt lacks that spirit of
a well-knit group.” he emp-has.ized.

Congress decided that by plac-
ing the responsibility for the suc-

'cess of the dances on organized

groups, such as the honorary frat-
ernities for example, instead of a
disorganized class, greater success
would beeassured.
Howard Greenberger,
Council representative, ointed
out that Congress "should not vote
for this change because of the fin-

Men’s

ancial loss primarily but because
of the lack of interest on the stu-
dents’ part.”

The report showed that attend-
ance at all-school dances has
been steadily decreasing since
1947.

In addition to the major criticism
which resulted in the organizational.
change, various members of Con-
gress had other ideas relating to
the cause of the dance failures.

"The fault lies with the publi-
city,” said Greenberger.

But Ray Maher believed the first
shortcoming was "recruitment.”
He charged that this year’s appoint-
ments committee did not give ade-
quate publicity to the positions
which they were appointing and
that very often “protegees” were
given jobs.

Betty Bolger favored less dances.
“There are too many," she said.

Congress also decided to buy a
typewriter. The age and the model
were left to the discretion of Phyllis
Beck, who was responsible for the
original purchase motion last week,
and Wilde, treasurer of Congress.

Hineke Plans Coup d’Etat Tomorrow
To Establish Military Controlgit Pitt

Col. John I. Hincke will spring a sneak coup d’etat on the
University at dawn tomorrow morning, April l, barring an over-

night hitch inplans-

The military department head’s plot to seize control of Pitt
with his ROTC corps was uncovered by the News today, despite
a rigidly-enforced security curtain, which has cloaked the ROTC
since it began outdoor manuevers on the Cathedral lawn last week.

Efforts to reach Chancellor Rufus H. ..Fitzgerald to notify him
of the expected coup failed today. However, the University marsh-
alls, headed by veteran William L. Daufenbach, have been alerted
and are standing by, awaiting orders to defend the University

against Hincke’ s panzers.

Col. Hincke’s history-making attack order (reprinted uelow)
fell into the hands of an alert News reporter, baring the‘ military
plot against the present University administration.

The order commands the 2000 man ROTC squad to assemble

under the cover of early-morning

assault weapons will be issued and
final briefing will take place.

At H-hour, 6 a.m., the attack will
be launched, the communique reveals.
It will disperse, on a carefully-laid
plan, individual units throughout
the campus. Col. Hincke has called
for the sneak attackto be completed
by 8 a.m. *

If successful, intelligence officers
will able to detain and screen stu-

istrative personnel as they arrive in

loyalty to the new regime will likely

be sent, along with Chancellor Fitz-‘

gerald and other top administrators,
toadetention camp in Logan Armory.
The master plan calls for shock

troops, to crush the Cathedral's
"nerve centers”—the elevators,
telephone switchboard, and post
office.

The outfit has been ordered to
cripple the University's "communica-
tion and transportation and to shut
off the target area completely from
the outside world. .

Airborne glider troops have been
assigned the .tasl< of subjugating

Up to Wednesday afternoon, the f

Until the SCF presents as list of

a welter of broken coffee cups with a green scum issuing from his lips.
Clutched in one hand he held a card reading, “Official Tuck Shop

Mr. S’crivo’s last written lines follow as he wrote them:

   °Green Valley’ Author

Third Series Speaker

Richard Llewellyn, author of "How Green Was My Valley,”

will

April 19.

speak in Stephen Foster Memorial Hall at 2:30 p.m.', on

Mr. Llewellyn’s talk is sponsored by the University Lecture

Series, of which ]. Edward Ricart
to the public.

Richard David Vivian Llewellyn
Lloyd has led a varied and adventu-
rous life. He was born in London, of
Welsh parents, and educated at St.
David’s, Cardiff, and London. While
in his early teens, he worked in a
coalmine, where he obtained material
forhis story ofthe Welshicoal miners,
"How Green Was My Valley.”

At the age of 16 he was sent to
Italy to learn hotel management, start-
ing in the kitchen. During his stay
in Venice, he studied briefly paint-
ing and sculpture and also the rudi-

ments of the film industry.

He has described the years up to
19 as “turbulent.” At that age, he
joined the regular British Army, and
saw servicein India. Returning after
five years of service, ‘he became a
movie extra in order to learn the
methods of production.

For a while, he did some reporting
for a movie magazine, and he also
was a boxer. At this time he began
doing his first creative writing.

Mr. Llewellyn rose through the
positions of assistant director, scen-
arist, production manager, and direc-
tor in the London film industry. A
slump in the business turned him to
playwriting, and he successfully
produced a play entitled "Poison
Pen.”

Then, during a long period of un-

is secretary. The lecture is open

employment, he wrote "How Green
Was My Valley,” a book which had
originally conceived during his period
in India

"How Green Was My Valley” be-
came a best-seller soon after its
publication in 1940 and was produced
shortly after as an Academy Award
motion picture.

With the beginning of the war,
Richard Llewellyn entered the army
once more and during the early years
of the war completed a second book,
"None But the Lonely Heart,” which
also became a motion picture.

Fluoride”, Dr. Cox will talk to
pre-dental students on the second
floor of the School of Specialized
Industry at 3941 O’Hara Street.

Through recent experiments in
several parts of the country, it has
been discovered that when applied
correctly minute amounts of fluo-
rine are instrumental in lessening
tooth decay.

Frank, J. Massioni, president of
the forum, has stressed his request
that all pre»-dent students attend
the forum, especially those inte-
rested in prospective tours to be
arranged through the Dental School
and Infirmary.

On the order of business at the
forum will be the taking of orders
for Pre-Dent keys. Those students
wishing to obtain keys but are un-
able to attend the meeting should
contact Massioni before the time of
the forum. 

Students Give
Radio Talk

Two freshman chemistry students
will put on a fifteen minute radio
program, "Headlines in Chemistry”
tonight at 6:45 over WCAE.

Kay Sterrett and Clifton Trees,
nephew of the ].C. Trees after whom
Trees Gym is named, are the first
students to take advantage of the
American Chemical Society’s offer
to grant radio time, in their "Chem-
istry and You” series, to students
who can write and produce a script
showing chemistry at work in list-
ener’s daily lives.

Sterrett and Trees’ program will
point out recent developments in
transportation and in the auto in-
dustry.

Both men are hoping to become
research chemists after graduation,
believing in what one prominent
chemist terms the "Chemocracy
of the Future,” -- a world in which
chemistry will play an increasingly
important part.

Anyone who remembers the pain-
ful experiences they had in a den-
tist’s chair will be interested in
the statement by Dr. Gerald J. Cox,
director of dental research. He
says that by adding a small amount

children need not suffer decay.

Cox adds, “If there is not
enough fluorine in the water the
teeth will be sparkling white, but
they will decay. If there is too
much fluorine the teeth will be
spotted, but there will be less de-
cay.”

However both of these problems
will be eliminated by,carefully
controlling the fluorine content of
the water, so that it is about

lVllen’s Lounge Plan

Postponed Until Fall

Men’s Council has put its proposal for an eighth floor men’s
lounge on the "things to be considered” list for next: semester.
Roy Nelson,'reporting on the lounge plans at Tuesday’s meet-

ing, said that the dean of men, in

spite of his expressed agreement

with Council’s objectives, had explained that Council'could not -

get the room at this time without
placing undue and unpleasant pres-
sure on University officials.

Mr. Biddle assures Council, how-
ever, that the dean of men’s office
will assist in the achieving of a
men’s lounge next semester in
817 C1. Edwin J. Mclntosh, MC

advisor and assistant dean of men,

A’ spoke for Dean Biddle at Tues-

’day’s meeting.
Space Problems Arise
The problem, according to Mr.
“‘ Mclntosh, would be to allow Men’s
'Council the use of 817 Cl. and to
find other adequate facilities for
the University band and orchestra
, which now use the room.
Council could conceivably use
the lounge during part of the day,
A even if the band were to remain.
But this procedure, says Mr. Mc-
Intosh, would probably be perman-
ent if it worked even fairly well,
and there would be little further
chance of using the room as a
lounge.-
Sharing the room with the band
.would entail the use of movable

S furnishings rather than permanent,

stationary furnishings, which would
give the room the needed lounge
atmosphere and save much time
and trouble.

Decide to Wait
This being the situation, Council
decided to wait till fall to try again.

Thirty Men
File Bids
For MC

Approximately 30 men have filed

petitions for nomination to Men’s

Council as the skirmish starts for
the 16 positions open on that body.

More petitions are coming in

steadily, according to Edwin J.
Mclntosh, MC advisor, with office-

seekers from the College out-
numbering those from the other
schools in the University.

All men students who -will have

attained sophomore standing by

next semester are eligible to peti-
for Council office.

MC petition blanks are available

at the dean of men's office and

must be turned in with 50 signa-
tures. Properly signed petitions

will be accepted as late as April 4.

To narrow down the number of
petitioners, a MC committee made
up of seven seniors and one mem-
ber of a lower class will meet on
April 5 to select four petitioners
to run for each of the ‘open posi-
tions.

Through the narrowing procedure,
the committee members will prune
out those nominees who in their
opinion are best suited for office
on the Council. If the number of
petitions for any position on Coun-
cil is less than four, every nominee
for that position will be a candi-
ldate in the election April 19.

How Will

Field House
Stack Up?

By Dave Pollock

(Second in a Series)

How would you like a seat
house costing $1,350,000?
It has a beautiful varnished

illuminated by brilliant lights. There’s no mass
of pillars to peer around not will your feet ache
from the cold. It should be a good game. Pitt’s
rejuvenated figure-eighters are playing Kentucky,
or maybe it’s Holy Cross, Notre Dame, or Bradley.
quite a treat and

Anyhow,
youke

it promises to be
invited.

That’s the situation that will confront Pan-
ther undergraduates next basketball season.

No Need to Hide

Though the Pitt field house won’t be as large
as some of the super jobs now dotting campuses

across the nation, Skyscraper U.
won’t have to hide its face when
basketball cqurts are mentioned
as she now does.

Let’s take a look at some other
field houses spread across the
country, besides the larger basket-
ball palaces mentioned in the‘ipre-
vious installment.

But first, keep in mind that the
Panther structure will seat around
7,000 fans and that the undergrad-

uate enrollment here is 11,200.
With that in mind, peruse this list:
School Seats Undergraduates
Michigan 9,000 18,500
Georgia 3,500 6,000
Nebraska 8,500 9,875
Utah 5,700 10,000
Oklahoma 5,000 11,400

W. Virginia 6,800 6,000
Missouri 5,500 5,500
Dartmouthi 2,400 2,900

Many schools such as Ohio State,

iYale, St. Louis U, University of

Oregon, Southern California, South-
ern Methodist University, Univer-
sity of North Carolina, Stanford,
Washington State, and U.C.L.A.
have no field houses. Or if they
do, they're not used for basketball.

More Seats Here

True, these institutions that
haven’t field houses do have a gym
floor of. some kind. 30.! outside
of the University of Oregon, none
of them seat as many as Pitt will
be, able to handle.

In fact, the Pacific Coast with
many large schools is worse off
than any other section in the nation

‘as far as suitable seating arenas

for basketball are concerned.»

The University of Washington is
one of the few exceptions on the
West Coast. Seating 12,500 for
basketball, the Huskies built their
field house in 1927 with additional
seats added in 1947. The total cost

was $1,000,000.

Mitterling Searching
For Versatile Catcher

V With the season opener at Virginia Military Institute only
six days off, Baseball Coach Ralph Mitterling is faced with the

mystery of Pitt’s masked marvel.

Who will be the Panther first team
catcher? Seeking the berthare Mark
Maystrovich, George Ma rich, Nick
Staracenic, and Joe Risacher.

The candidate chosen to don the
catcher’s mask as number one re-
ceiver will have to be a marvel to
fill Pitt’s needs. In the backstop
position, Mitterling needs aman who
can not only catch, but one who can
throw, hit, and handle pitchers with

planned for a better field house?)

field houses are campus schools.
This means that more students are
on hand to attendicage games.
Therefore, they need larger seating
capacities.

At Pitt, 7,000 seats should be
enough to take care of all under-
graduates wanting to attend games,
since many commuters have no de-
sire to travel back to the campus to
attend an evening game once they
have left Oakland.

One can readily see that Pan-
ther basketball fans won’t be too
bad off when the field house is
built . . . at least the students
won’t. But the general publicwhich
also lil_<es to see a good basketball
game and which could very well
pay for the Panther sports program,
has been forgotten. '

Could Pitt have

maximum effectiveness.

“All of the catching candidates,
four holdovers from last year, are
good prospects,” says Mitterling.
"I expect to carry two catchers this
year. Choosing which two of these
four will do the catching will be a
fob.

Risacher and Matich Share

Last year, Risacher, a Joe who.

‘$3

didn't have a "let George do it
attitude, shared the catching chores
with Matich. Risacher and Matich
both had the ability to handle pi_t-
chers. Of the two, Matich had the
better arm, but Risacher was more
potent with the_ bat. ,

Pressing these last year regulars
for the receiving iob are Maystrovich
and Staracenic. Maystrovich has a
“good arm.

Maystrovich Converted

A long ball hitter, Maystrovich
doesn’t have the experience behind
the plate that Risacher and Matich
have. He’s a converted first base-
man.

Staracenic, the best hitter of the
quartet, ’doesn’t have the arm the
others have. Small and full of savvy,

he brings out the best in pitchers.‘

For the. best results, Pitt's mar-
vel should hit like Staracenic, have
Maystrovich’s arm, handle pitchers
like Risacher, and have Matich’s

Situation
Probed
By Hearst

By STAN SKIRBOLL
A double reaction was set off

to Tuesday’s News story con- 

cerning the alleged charges of
the Pitt rifle team thatrDuquesne
University’s team score was amaz-
ing and impossible. ~'

The charges came followinglthe’
results of the Hearst National Rifle
matches in which the Dukes took a
first place.

A Hearst representative from
the Pitts burgh Sun-Telegraph immed-
iately began an investigation/of
the charges.

(This is not an April Fool’s story)

Meanwhile, Colonel John I.
Hincke, ROTC head, in a letter to
the News has retracted the story
of his rifle squad.

Col. Hincke’s letter follows:

“On page _5 of the Pitt News
»dated March 28, 1950, under the
heading ‘Riflers Fire Oral Blast
at Dukes,’ you published certain
irresponsible remarks on the part
of the coach and members of the
Pitt rifle team. These remarks
pertained to the scores recently
made by the riﬂe teams of Duquesne
University in winning first, second
and third places in the Hearst Na-'
tional ROTC Rifle Competitions
for 1950. It was stated that the
scores were ‘impossible’ and must
have all been made from the ‘prone
position,’
Duquesne teams did not observe
the regulations governing the firing
of these matches.

poor sportsmanship on the part of 0

Fact-Packed

Field llouse Series

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

 

Since 1945 veterans of World War II havebeen clamoring for
, reliving space. For a long time now Pitt students have been yelling
xfor a place where they can have recreation between or after

classes. And for many months the News has been squawking to

University officials that more office 4

space is needed.

, It seems that space is a commodity
which this earth is rapiglly running
short on.

I Who is more aware of the problem

,0  than the men who run Pitt’s athletic
'0 .program? Captain Tom Hamilton,
Frank Carver, Leo Bemis, Doc Carl-
son, Carl Olson, Ben Grady-all
those who have been banging their
heads againstthis wall, this problem
of where to play a game of ball.

With a view toward solving, or at
least alleviating, the situation, the

.. .ath,l»etic administration worked out

 , plans for a new field house, seating

7000 or so persons, and a non-seat-

ing gym.

 - Compare

Any relief is welcome relief; but
even with the new structures, how
will Pitt compare with other schools
.of equal size? Howmuch longef will
, Hamilton and his aides have to rack
A their collective brains? What are the
obstacles to be overcome? ‘

We of the News staff thought our
readers might care to know the an-
iswers to such questions, so we; asked
Dave Pollock, one of our sports wri-

 

ters, to look into the matter. Pollock
surveyed 44 colleges and universities
in all sections of the nation and
came up with a batch of pertinent
facts.

Facts Count

In the first of a series of three
articles, which started Tuesday,
Pollock established the fact that
Pitt’s proposed field house will look

‘like an Outhouse compared to some

of the super edifices around the
country.

Such a comparison is scarcely
flattering to the" University, but it
may serve to awaken Pitt supporters
who have failed to get behind Hamil-

’ ton to the best of their ability. Pitt

has chosen to stay in big-time ath-
letics. Suchachoice cannot be acted

_upon in a lukewarm manner.

To be sure, Pitt will not be as
bad off as many a school, and P01-
lock’s articles contain the goods to
back this up. The series is a factual
one. Certainly if the athletic pro-
gramisgoing to progress, a thorough
knowledge of the facts cannot help
but push it along.

Panthers Sign Joh n“L. Lewis 

John L. Lewis has been signed
by Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
as chief football talent scout in
the hard coal regions.

The signing was announced after
two weeks of off-and-on contract
negotiations, during which time
John L. walked out on the Captain
twice and failed to show up on one
other occasion.

Following the agreement, Lewis
issued a formal statement: “It will
be good to get back to the Pitts.”

ﬂickered on Assignment

Although Lewis signed to work
the strip mining regions, it was
learned that Captain Hamilton ori-
ginally wanted him to cover the
shaft mines. But Lewis declared
adamantly that he did not wish to
get the shaft.

Lewis is reported to have told
the Captain, "Such an act would
not be compatible with the best,
heartfelt interests of the formid-
able task at hand, and would fur-

The Pitt basketball coach has
been working with his squad this
Week, with an emphasis on “a mov-
ing offense that puts a premium on
ball handling and speed,” accord-
ing to the New York Herald Tri-
bune, sponsors of the affair.

Spectators at the easterners’
practice sessions were entertained
by “the gyrations through which
Dr. Carlson had them spinning.”
Shades of Panther hoop drills!

Carlson fears that the West team,
coached by Amory Gill of Oregon
State, is “bigger and better than
his squad.”

He adds that George McCrossin
of Pitt, who was slighted by the
All-Star selectors, is as good as
any one of half of his team.

Pittsburgh’s television station,
WDTV, will not televise the game.

Coss’Mail Competes With
Letters to Famous Coaches

Raymond L. Coss, director of building and grounds at the Uni-
versity, receives more fan mail than anyone else at Pitt.

That’s quite an accomplishment when the competition includes
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, famous athletic coaches like
"Doc” Carlson, Len Casanova, and Carl Olson, as well as many

distinguished professors and scho-
lars. _

In 1930 the building and grounds
department converted five acres of
ground between Bigelow and Belle-
field into the beautiful campus
lawn which Pittsburgh residents
and tourists have admired ever
since.

Receives Hundreds of Letters

Mr. Coss is in charge of keeping
up the appearance of the cathedral‘
lawn and that accounts for his
amazing popularity.

Every spring the building and

grounds department, located in G32 V ‘

of the Cathedral, receives hundreds
of requests asking Mr. Coss just
how to grow a thick, beautiful
lawn. 1

Several years ago the department
was swamped with so many re-
quests that the building and ground
department mimeographed hundreds
of instruction sheets for the home
gardeners to follow.

Secret of Success

The instructions reveal the se-
cret behind the success of the
beautiful lawn. They simply ex-
plain that the seed bed and care
the grass is given after it comes
up are even more important than
the kind of seed planted.

Of course, the instruction sheets
fail to mention the painstaking":
year-round care that the ground
crew devotes to maintain the
handsome appearance of the cam-
pus.

Much of the lawn will be sacri-
ficed when the University building
program begins, but Mr. Coss _as-
sures everyone that the remaining
grounds will continue to be a credit
to the University and to the city.

Theatron Taps
Pittsburghers

Theatron, dramatics _honorary
fraternity, has tapped’ Shirley Eckles
of"Kiss Me, Kate” and Gene Kelly,
Pittsburgh’s well known movie star
to honorary membership.‘

The two Pittsburgh actors, who
were notified last week, have been
invited to attend tonight’s Harle-
quinade costume ball, being held
by Theatron in the Hotel Schenley
ballroom from 9 until 1 a.m.

True to the tradition of the cos-

tume ball, masks will be worn until

midnight.

The George Black Octette will
provide the dance music for the
costumed couples. Semi-formal
dress will also be worn.

Tickets are $3.25 including tax,
and may be obtained at the Student
Desk or from members of Theatron.

EC Tuck Shop

Scene of Dance

The Tuck Shop at Ellsworth Cen-
ter willbe converted into a ball room
for an afternoon dance on April 13,
from 3 to 5 p‘.m. according to Don
Carothers, chairman of the E.C.
Student Council.

.A special street car, furnishing
transportation to the dance, will
leave the Fifth Avenue entrance of
the Cathedral at 2:45 p.m.

Although new freshmen women and
sorority pledges have been invited
specifically, all coeds are welcome
toattend. ‘

Refreshmentsjwill be served at the
dance. 2

Military Coup
Revealed; Revolt
Led by Hincke

(Cont. from Page 1)

Fitzgerald’s offices on the Cathe-
dral’s first floor.

From the deposed chancellor's
desk, the military commandant and
would-be chancellor hopes to direct
the final stages of the attack.

The assault plan does not touch
the athletic domain of Athletic
Director Thomas J. Hamilton. Col.
Hincke apparently feels that Hamil-
ton, an ex-Navy captain, and his
staff, heavily-laden with ex-service
personnel, will toe the line of the
new regime.

It has been authoritatively learned
that Col. Hincke flew to Washington
last week, apparently to complete
the long-range planning for the coup.
He is believed to have conferred
with the Secretary of the Army, and
ex-Naval officer Harold L. Stassen,
chancellor at the University of Penn-
sylvania, and former general Dwight
D. Eisenhower, chancellor of Colum-
bia University.

This has led political observers,’

in light of today’s startling expose,
to suspect that the overthrowing of
the present Pitt administration is
designed to extend a military band
of university control from Pittsburgh
to New York in major colleges.

After the Easter recess the lec-
ture series on Hebrew-Christian
Heritage sponsored by the YM&WCA
will be resumed with two discus-
sions by the Reverend Charles
Blaker, head of the Westminister
Foundation.

The first one will be on April 13,
on the twelfth floor at 2:30 p.m.
Reverend Blaker will speak on

',‘Monotheistic Ethics in New Test- .

ament.” On April 20 he will-lec-
ture on “The Message of Jesus.”

The first two lectures were given
by Rabbi Murray Rothman.
