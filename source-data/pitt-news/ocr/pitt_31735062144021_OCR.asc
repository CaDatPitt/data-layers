Enrollment
Sets Record

The 1946 summer session an-
nouncement and schedule of class-
es is now being prepared and will
be available about the mi-ddle of
May.

According to Dr. Frank W.
Sh.ockley, director of the summer
sessions, this year’s program is by
far the largest that the University
has ever presented. It is also ex-
pected that the enrollment will
exceed that of any other year.

This year, a 12-week semester
will «be given, extending from
June 17 to September 6. This will
carry a semester’s credit. In ad-
dition, two regular six-weeks ses-
sions will be presented, June 17
to July 26 and July 29 to Septem-
ber 6. Each of these will give the
student credit for a semester’s
work. By taking the two six-
weeks courses he will receive a
year’s credit.

For teachers, two post-two
weeks sessions will be given, July
29 to August 9 and August 12 to
August 23.

In nursing, three sessions will be
presented: eight weeks, June 1-0
to August 3; two weeks, Ju.ne 17
to June 28; and four weeks, July
1 to July 25.

Retail Training plans two three-
week sessions, July 1 to July’ 20
and July 22 to August 10.

At Johnstown, a 12-week ses-
sion will extend from June 10
to August 30., and two six-week
sessions from June 10' to July 19
and July 22 to August 30.

Abie Gets Vet-Review Buildup
In Tuck Shop Interview

The other day we went down to the Black Hole of Calcutta, other-
wise known as the Blue Tuck shop, to dig up some dirt on the Vet's
review. After having been overcome by smoke three times, we ﬁnally
managed to grope our way to a table where sat our old friend and

compatriot, E. Abercombie Faffuffnik.

“Abie” (we always call him

Abie to save time) was very busily engrossed in devouring a triple
decker, super-deluxe, old-fashioned meat-loaf sandwich, with one

slice of pickle.
was to be interviewed for the Pitt
News, his eyes brightened and
food was forgotten-for the nonce.

“You’re going to the ’Vet’s re-
view, aren’t you?” we asked,
twisting his arm.

“Of course,” he winced. “In
fact I’m cutting three classes to
attend.”

Pinning him against the wall
with one ;hand, and relieving him
of his sandwich with the other, we
explained that the vet’s show deals
with the typical GI’s army career,
from his draft board examination
to the ﬁnal reconversion to pea-ce-
time college life. In between skits
there will be singing and juggling
acts. Not amateur stuﬁ, strictly
professional.

“Have you ever heard the “Bal-
lad for Americans’?” we asked
Abie. ‘

“Yes,” he said.

“No, you haven’t,” we corrected
him. “You’ve never really heard it

Heari.ng that he¢

sung until you’ve heard the vet’s
chorus doing it. And, speaking of
chorus, the show even has chorus
girls for their nightclub skit.”

Abie drooled. As he wiped his
mouth with a dirty piece of
Kleenex we told him about the
draft board scene and the way the
vets have satirized their overseas
experiences, their trip back home,
their discharge examinations, and
their troubles with civilians.

“Yes,” protested Abie, “but is
the show funny?”

“Funny? It has a gag every 30
seconds. Good gags. None of
your Joe Miller jokes, either.”

“Chorus girls!” interrupted Abie.
“Oh, boy!”

Feeling that he had been amply
persuaded to attend he battled our
way from the room. Abie went
back to the counter to buy another
triple-decker, super—deluxe old-
fashioned meat loaf sandwich with

one pickle.

ed at the National Education As-
sociation conference on the educa-
tion of veteran.s in the colleges
and universities, given last week

counter upon enrolling for a
course in higher education.

The representatives of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh were Theo-
dore W. Biddle, dean of men;
George W. Hoffman, veterans’ ad-

group with its uniforms, and has
been a constant and enthusiastic
supporter‘ of the organization. In
1940 the band made an appear-
ance at his Vose-Mary estate on

has donated $5,000 to a fund for
the acquisition of new band in-
struments.

A full-sized unit with complete

Pittsburgh concert band, in its
first appearance since 1942, will
present an out-door program for

hide and Fugue in G Minor” by
Bach, “Dancing Tambourine.” Se-
lections from “Oklahoma”, “Vi-
enna Dreams,” “Animal. Magic,"
and “The Star Spangled Banner.”

The concert band will go on :1

It is possible that we are witch hunting-—but it seems rea-l
sonablc to charge that the Committee on Recognition of Studentf
Organizations has put into effect a set of rules through whichiitg

-can maintain an absolute rule over ‘every student orgaiiizationj

under its jurisdiction.

In last week’s issue of the News was a story -reporting the .

ofﬁcial recognition of the Veterans association and of the Pitt
Flying club by the Committee on Recognition of Student Or-
ganizations. Included in the story was a list of ‘the fifteen
“bases of initial recognition or continued approval of student
or:gan.izations” by which the committee will determine whether

or not an organization is to receive or hold official "University
~re’cogn1t1on.

If one were able to cut his Way through the unbe-
lievable vcrboseness of the first “basis,” he would have ‘found
two points of particular signiﬁcance.

Paragrapli number thirteen, a gem in something or other
ever there was one, read, “It (an organization) shall have all
printed material checked through the office of the dean of men or
women and the University editor before it is published, this is
‘to insure accuracy and University standards in printed material
bearing the University name.”

Obviously devoted to the same purpose, paragraph number
14 said, “All oﬁcainpus newspaper publicity shall be cleared
through the University News service.”

A certain amountof University control over a student or-
ganization is reasonable——probably it’s even desirable. But the

"dictatorial-censorship which paragraph ‘number tllll’Tl(39l’l -and, to

a lesser extent, p:_iragraph number fourteen can bring about is
carrying matters too far.

\7Ve are not accusing the committee of trying to muzzle the
student organizat.ions which it controls, at least not yet. Since
the committee has had organizations under its jurisdiction for
only a little more than a week, no practical application of para-
graphs thirteen and fourteen has been made. Vtle accuse the
committee of notthiiig. "We merely say that it has set up ina-
chinery that can be unfair to «a student organization. We are
anxious to see how the committee uses its power.

Paragraph number one, while not as important as thirteen
and fourteen, was far more interesting. lit reads:
I “The organization shall contribute to the same general ends
for which the University exists. It shall promote the happiness
and welfare of its members; show consideration for the interests
of non-members; foster friendly relations between students and
niembers of -the iaculty and administration; stimulate critical
thinking and devotion to studies; preserve the freedom of the
individual; encoiirage high social. standards; cultivate good
taste; provide experience in the application of democratic pig.in—
ciples; give training in leadership and efficient management;

and in all these ways serve the University and create loyalty to

her.”

_ The obvious purpose of the paragraph was to be very speciﬁc
in stating exactly what was expected of a student organization.
'lhe purpose is commendable, but it does not make the paragraph
or the committee appear anyless ridiculous,

' Russ Robinson.

THE PITT NEWS

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor:
Last Friday while I listened to
President Truman and former
President Hoover speaking -on the
radio abouttlie critical food situa-
tion in Europe and Asia, it oc-
curred to me, that we of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh can and
should be contributing some effec-
tive support toward alleviating
thisiproblem. I do not see how we
can prevent the evil inﬂuence
which the specter of starvation is
~everitually certain to estalzilisli. and

make it available to the UNRRA.
The legislature of the State might
also be prodded into some sort of

3. That we contribute funds if
such be necessary to make the
foodstuffs available to the UNRRA.

4. That the Faculty club din-
ing room and University cafeteria

and Tuck shops be closed for one
or two noon meals each week or
at least that they eliminate all
grain, grain products, fats and oils
and any other European food
needs from their menus for a sim-
ilar period. This is only in ac-
cordance with the President’s re-
quest.

5. That I and any others, who
‘are so inclined, volunteer our
services to the U.  Merclisnt

‘most effectively utilize them to

carry this food to its destination.

6. That the University coop-
erate iwith the other colleges in
the Pittsburgh district and else-
where in such a program and stim-
ulate an interest in it at other
Universities.

All of this would be in addition
-to the meager results of the re-
cently completed “Can a Man”
campaign.

Some pretty big Pitt elections
are on the agenda next Wednes-
day. Elections are never funny
unless in retrospect, so there will
be a greater deﬁciency than usual
of humor for the next few lines.
Any vet who walks «out of school
next week without voting'doesn’t
dese"ve the right to complain of
the results of the election. It’s very.
soul satisfying to sit on the back

of your lap and gripe about ‘the
terrible state of things but un-
less you have made an effort to
do something about it then you
must take what you get. ‘Now as
this column was dreamed up some-
what before nominations were
made public, there is no personal
interest at stake. Anyhow, it isn’t
the intent of this rambler to urge
the vet to vote for any particular
candidate but merely to urge him
to vote (period). Vote for a non-
vet, a Vet, a frat man, or an in-
dependent, but ‘vote. “Put your
money‘ where your mouth is”
might be ‘a little uncouth (heavens
to Betsy, we mustn’t be uncouth
at Pitt) but it is expressive.
Wish they’d allow us in the Tuck
shop again. Some of our best cut’
classes were spent there. But we
had to open our big mouth. Speak-
ing of the T. S. someone mentioned’
the booth system as being as ser-
ious as the caste system. Tradition
has it you know, that certain
groups inhabit certain booths. All
right, we’ll come out and say it

THE PITT NEWS‘.

Pitt Goes All  
To Help Win Peace

What was Pitt’s contribution to
Victory? Why, Pitt gave improved
gun :steels, digestible army ra-
tions, artiﬁcial rubber, improve-
ments in electronics, techniques in
tropical engineering, contributions
to the improvement of war dentis-
try, and above everything else-
men.

The story of Pitt and the war-

has been.written at the request of
the Pennsylvania Historical and
Museum commission.

Pitt gave the 211 men symboliz-

ed by the gold stars on our service

ﬂag, and the 9,504 who came back,
241 of whom were women. Of
those :s-tudents and faculty mem-
bers in service, 56.7 per cent were
commissioned ofiicers, 5~0 army
colonels and eight captains in the
navy. Pitt men won ﬁve Distin-
guished Scrvice Crosses, which is
second in honor -only to the Con-
gressional Medal of Honor. A Pitt
man, the late Lt. Col. Boy-d Wag-
ner, was the war’s ﬁrst ace. An-
other, Lt. Col. Edward 'I‘eats,
helped pilot Ge.neral Douglas Mac-
Arthur from the Philippines to
Australia.

Pitt helped train 4,136 aviation
students of the Army Air Corps.
It also helped train 121 officers as
militaryugovernors and 541 enlist-
ed men as- area and language spe-
cialists. The University added to
the training of 7,051 army and
navy personnel and 24,048 civilians
in war techniques lister as engi-
ne-ering, science, and management

Postwar r i n g S synonimously
with reorganization and re—invig—
oration of men’s activities in the
halls at Pitt. Membership records
have been brought out, dusted off,
and once again happily ﬁlled with
the names of John Doe’s, Peter
Pitt’s, and ex—GI Joe’s. All the ac-
tivity closets, locked for the dur-
ation, are open now. The cobwebs
of four war years have been swept
away, and everything has been
arranged and rearranged for ac-
tivity housekeeping, especially on
the eighth ﬂoor, "the center of
men’s activities.

Since this is the general trend
of men’s activities, it goes to fol-
low that Men’s council should be
right in with the spirit of things,
and it is. This year the council is
once more getting settled and com--
pleting reorganization.

During the war years with more
men leaving than coming to Pitt,
the operations of the Council were
churned by the constant turnover
and replacement of men. But now,”
says Arnold Steinman, president
of the Council, “we’re ready to
start to work.” What does he mean
by work? He means service to
Pitt.

The Council is a service organ-
ization established for the pur-
pose of serving the school in every
way possible. In the past the coun-
cil sponsored and operated a used
book store. This book exchange,
which has not been operating since
1942, was located on the eighth
ﬂoor. Students of the University
could sell their used textbooks
to the book exchange and save
money by buying the used text-
books of some other student._,’I‘he
exchange was not operated for
proﬁt, but what proﬁt there wa.s,
went into the student loan fund.
Beginning September of next sem-
ester, the closet of the book ex-
change will be unlocked and ready
for use.

The student loan fund is also
sponsored by Men’s council; but
-because most students at Pitt will
not be permanent members of the
University, the task of operating
the fund is in the hands of a per-
manent faculty committee. Charles
H. Ebert Jr. is the administrator
of this fund. Recently, with the
return of service men, the loan
fund's principal duty has been the
granting of temporary. financial
aid to veterans until they receive
their government allowances.

Besides sponsoring the student
loan fund and the book exchange,
the Council makes a “careful
study of all problems appertaining
to men students.” For instance,
the Council hopes to have a stu-

v /

Eldridge

dent union. “The student union,”
says Mr. Arthur, advisor to Men’s
council, “will be a headquarters
for the men of the University.” It
will be housed in a large building
which will have the room and
facilities for banquets, dinners, fa-
cilities for recreation such as
bowling and facilities for social
eve.nts such as dances. The stu-
dent union will -be central head-
quarters for the business of man-
aging and conducting men’s ac-
tivities.

Men’s customs an-d traditions,
and freshman customs are also
under the guidance of the Council.
The upper class counsellor.s, most
of whom are members of the
Council, are in charge of fresh-
man customs and activities. Those
men entering the University and
having room in their freshman
year for a class of orientation are
placed in a group under the guid-
ance of an upper class counsellor.

Excepting for student instructors.
in men’s orientation, these classes
run parallel with those of the
women.

Back to the problem of arrange-
ment and rearrangement, the
Council has introduced one new
policy. It used to be that the mem-
bers of the Council held their po-
sitions for one year. Now, once
elected, members remain in the
Council for all four school years.

Membership in the Council, bas-
ed on ‘September’s «enrollment,
consists of one representative for
every 100 men in a‘ school. Seven
students from the College, three
students fro mthe School of Busi-
ness Administration, and three
students from the school of Engi-
neering are serving on the Coun-
cil now... One senior from the
Council is chosen to represent the
Council in Student congress.

These men on the Council are
the most active on campus. They
are the leaders, the men who are
charged chieﬂy with the good
housekeeping of all men’s activity
closets, and withthe promotion of
the general good welfare of men
on Pitt’s campus.

Seventh Floor Art Exhibition
Features Veteran Collection

About a year ago, Edward Forbes, C ’47, walked up to a pretty,
young girl at an F.D.R. victory celebration and asked her: “Won’t
you come up to see my etchings?” She did and he had them.

Forbes, an air corps veteran, stationed for 32 months at a lonely
outpost in Alaska, is currently exhibiting on the seventh ﬂoor of the
Cathedral a 60—piece collection of Ivory carvings. The carvings,

which include such pieces as cribbage boards, dogs and bears, and

knives and nutcrackers, are madc¢
from the tusks of the walrus and
the mammoth, an animal now ex-
tinct over 50,0«O'0l years.

our own country, mainly uses
hand tools, such as mouth and
hand drills to cut through the hard
material.

By the way, the girl who came
up to see Mr. Forbes’ etchings is
now his wife.

Mr. Fobes, who started the col-
lection of these carvings -to pre-
vent -himself from joining the long
ranks of Alaskan psychoneurotics,
relates that these carvings ‘“are_
made by the Alaskan Eskimo, now
quite adjusted to western culture,
and by air corps men stationed in
that area. The collection, now on
exhibition contains only pieces
made by Eskimos from the Ber-
ing Sea coast.

Forbes stated that the Eskimo,

Drive Obtains
Fine Results

Final results of the Pitt Canned
Goods Drive have been obtained,
and the committee has announced
the following quota collected on
campus. Six hundred ﬁfty c-ans
were contributed by individuals
and organizations. With the $150
contributed, in addition, by organ-
izations and students these items
have been purchased for over—seas
shipment.

One hundred—twenty gallons of
canned evaporated milk enough to
feed 30 babies for one month, were
bought from a local wholesaler.
Also 210 pounds of canned ham
were bought, or enough to pro-
vide meat twice a day for three
adults for 15 weeks.

. “All this food will not, of course,
be sent to the same area,” said
Penn Burke and Abbie Wester-
mann, chairmen of the drive, “but
it gives a rough estimate in statis-
tics of the results. The signiﬁcance
of the ﬁgures is doubly important,
moreover, when it is ﬁonsidered
that 15 weeks is approximately the
time it will take before the fall
crops begin to come to full fruition
in southern Europe.”

Of particular help in the drive
was the First Unitarian Church of
Pittsburgh which paid all the

From all appearances it looks
as though this is the pledges week
to howl since the majority of the
houses are having their pledge
dances and in many of them the
pledges and actives are changing
places. Now to stumble through
the facts of the week. We ﬁnd
that the PiKA’s have challenged
their brothers from Tech to a
basketball game and the loser will
hold a dance for the winner,
sounds like a good idea.

The Pi Lams. are initiating ﬁve
new men and have ‘a pledge dance
scheduled for this Saturd-ay night.
The Delts are beginning to treat
their pledges like humans since
they have to change places with
them Saturday night, at the Bow-
ery Brawl. The brothers welcome

‘back Jim Ludwig from the Army

Air Force, and transfers Harry
Fabre and George Kountz from
W&J will be on hand for the fes-
tivities.

The Phi Delts tell us that they
had a swell time dancing at the
Kappa house last Monday. The
Phi Gams are having the Tri Delts
over for a dance this evening.
Looks like the Fiji's are in for a
ﬁne evening. They also have an
invitation house dance this Sat-
urday. At the annual alumni ban-
quet at the P. A. A. over two hun-
dred loyal»Fiji’s were present.

Our neighbors, the SAE’s had
the Thetas up for a dessert dance
last Monday and are having a
pledge dance this Saturday. To-
night they are going up to the Phi
Mu apartment for a dance.

Now we come to the Phi Kap’s
who are preparing themselves for
a rip-snorting time since the
TPA’s are inviting them over on

Friday night. Saturday night they

are having a. pledge dance.

Panther Thinclads Win Ohio U
Meet; Douglas and Doak Star

By Al Roth

With a climax bearing the melodrama of a World Series seventh game, the Pitt Panther trackmen
opened their 1946 outdoor campaign with a 70-61 triumph over Ohio university at Athens on Saturday.
Not until the ﬁnal event of the afternoon, the-one mile relay, was completed, was the victor ﬁnally

decreed.

Moving into the terminating attraction, the Pittmen held the» upper. hand in the hectic affair by a

slim margin of 65-61.

With the tide of battle weighed on: the closing ﬁve, points, the Panther. one-mile.

relay aggregation of Clarence Doak, Johnny Ulam, Gene-Heide, and Herb Douglas-breezed throughthe
clincher with a 3:32 minute eiTort.¢ - »

The travel weary Panthers ex-
-celled manifestly in the track
events, garnering eight ﬁrst places
from a possible nine but lack of
reserves and a faltering ﬁeld
squad hindered the Olsonmen.

Hard working Douglas collected.

a total of 20.markers for the local
cause, handily gaining firsts in the
1-00 yard dash, 220, high jump,
and broad jump.

The Blue and Gold opened up
with a donation of nine points
through a forfeiture of the pole
vault event. Following this, they
suffered a relapse in their quest
for victory when Hartman, Schleo-
cher, an-d Buhai, all of Ohio,
spurned Pitt’s best in the shot put.

Spunky little Ed Sudzina was

his usual steady self and fought-

A new prospect was discovered
on the Jungle Cat horizon in the
person of Jack Henderson. an ex
air -corps -ofﬁcer. Hen-derson, in
his. very ﬁrst varsity competition
on Saturday, captured" second
place. in the mile run and tied
teammate Bill Curtis, pre-war
cross-country ace at Pitt, in the

two mile event. The -blonde haired‘

Wilkinsiburg athlete distinguished
himself in the one mile chase,
when after trailing a duet of Ohio-
ans for three la-ps, he ﬁred up in
the. ﬁnal quarter and passed the
«bewildered Athenians.

The Panthers measured one,
two, and threein the javelin. toss.
Johnny Ulam led the ﬁeld with at
high looping heave of 168 feet
followed in order by Pat Griffin
and Bill Camp.

This weekend Coach Olson will
take a small squad to the 52nd
annual running of the Penn Re-
lays on Friday and Saturday. The
remainder of the team will move
into Schenley park where they
will engage in a duel meet with
Carnegie Tech on the T.artan’s
home grounds.

Sports Editor

Back in the days when K. E. Davis was graduate manager ‘of
-"athletics, vmany thought that the football situation was bad. Today,
according to people that know, Pitt is “worse off.”

At the time when K. E. was at the helm, several prominent aluni-ni 1

decided to do something about the existing sad situation——-and so they
did. A. R. Hamilton,'Joe Trees and Floyd Rose who could be called
the “God Fathers” of big time football at Sky Scraper U. under the
~manipulation of the late K. E. Davis did “the something.”

The -Panthers went out and imported two coaches-—Joe Duff and
Nubbs "Harlem both from Princeton. Duff and Nubbs, despite their
good record, resigned after two seasons in favor of the most «popular
coach of that day “Pop” Warner.

Pop kept the ball rolling at Pitt and produced many a winner.
When his chance came to better himself he left Pitt for Stanford. Then
Jock Sutherland stepped in.

Sutherland did__n’t have it too rosey in the Smokey City. His
teams weren’t a house on ﬁre as the early records show and the
“Three God Fathers” didn’t care for his dull brand of ball. K. E.
-was put on the ‘spot. At the completion -of Jock’s third year the
‘big boys wanted K. E. to ﬁre Sutherland. K. E. refused; so Ham--»o
ilton, Trees, and Rose withdrew their support.

Taking over the support of the team was the University and there
it remained until 1938. Today the records from 1938 to 1945 speaks
for themselves.

Basketball Is Spreading

Basketball like all ‘other Arn'eri'ca'n sports is on the move. Dr.
Carlson received word froma gent byitheiname of G. C. Kacadjopoulos
from Athens, Greece, to send him all available -information on the
Figure 8,play of ball. Kacadjopoulos is coach of the Sporting club of
Athens ?basketball team. According to the letter the way of playing
in  is '--very primitive. V

tsuggestionz A coach had better be sent along with the infor-
mation.

The Pitt tennis team returns from*a year of-hibernation to play Ohio State, Saturday, at Whe’é‘1?{"g
W. Va. The team disbanded last year because of obvious reasons resulting from the war. But this year
-many of Pitt's former tennis stars have returned; add to these many young high school stars and you
have the nucleus for a strong team.

Coaching the netmen this «year will be Dr. Dave O’Loughlin, Pitt tennis star of the mid-twenties.
Dr. O’Loughlin and his brother, John, combined to "form an unbeatable combination on an undefeated
‘team in 1926. The two brothers were preceded by another brother, Billy, who sparked ﬁne Pitt tennis
‘teams of the early twenties. ‘Dr. O’Loughlin is striving to regain the

lost prestige Pitt once owned when he was a tennis player.
Dr. O’Loughlin is by no means new at the Pitt coaching job, since

he led Pitt tennis teams from the late thirties until 1943.

Buck Johnson started on the

pitching good ball with Salem un-

he lost control. With two men out

Johnson walked two Salem men

‘boys have been using the West-

inghouse court for the past sev-
eral weeks to get into shape.
Others who wish to try out for
the team still have a chance, it
was announced by the coach. The
Westinghouse court is at their dis-
posal and he urges them to make
use of it.

‘Some progress has deﬁnitely
been made in selecting a team,
however, for Paul Steele and Jack
Southworth have been appointed
co-captains by Dr. O’Loughlin.
Others who have shown partic-
ular ability in the practice sessions
at the Westinghouse court are
Chuck Roberts, Bobby Bald, Jack
O’Brien, Art Harmuth, Harry Gil-
lespie, and Jack Clinton. South-
worth and Bald have looked espe-
cially good working together as a
doubles entry. Steele and Roberts
have also been paired and so has
Harmuth and O’Brien. Thesemen
will probably comprise the team
that faces Ohio State on Saturday.

Work on the tennis courts near
Trees gym has been completed and
the courts are in ﬁne shape once
again. Regular work-outs will
probably be shifted from the West-
inghouse court to these courts-this
week.

You Know Now

Here are a few things that you
might not know, but now you do.

Wes Fesler is driving his auto-
mobile but without a spare wheel
and tire. In his weekly banquet
circuit tour someone stole Fes'ler’s
car while he was addressing a
group in Greensburg.

Car recovered—minus the wheel
and tire.

Another one for the books.
When the en;;‘inc-ers constructed
Pitt stadium they must have ex-
pected to have bigger and better
teams as the years went by for
they built it so that an extra tier
could be added.

Pitt expects to gain the serv-
ices -of a former gridder for
n-ext fall. Word has it that
“Primo” Dimattio a halflback
for Charlie Browser will be back
carrying the pigskin which fall
practice is called.

Dimattio is remembered by
his 98-yard run for a touch-
down against Min.nes.o.ta back
in 1942 when Pitt lost 50-7.
His grid play was cut short in
his .sophomore year due. to a
leg injury, leaving him with
two years of eligibility.

The Very latest news this week
is the big success of the Woody
Herman concert in Carnegie "hall.
His performance of the E-bony
Concerta, written for him bylgor
Stravinsky, was highly praised by
the majority -of New York jazz
critics; although the real climax

THE PITT NEWS

N eesham

of the eveni.ng was accredited to
Ralph Burns’ Summer Sequence,
a piece, treated no doubt, in a
style more American than the
Stravinsky number. The Sequence
written and played by the 23-
year old pianist—composer, con-
tained exceptional passages for
solo guitar, piano, and brass en-
semble; the piano, guitar and brass
combination in the third section
seemed to be the ‘best liked of
the movements. One thing is clear,
however, and that is that it is
impossible to judge on first per-
formance or first hearing a com-
position with such complicated
rhythmic patterns and atonal har-
monies as the Stravinsky Concerto.
It is probably very far from the
American jazz medium and it de-
mands a careful study of the score
and the records before a fair state-
ment can ‘be made.

The -soloists at the Herman per-
formance put on an exceptional
show. Top honors were split among
Flip Phillips’ tenor sax rendition
of Sweet and Lovely, Bill Harris’
trombone on Everywhere, and
Man I Love done by Red Norvo on
the vibraharp. In short the Her-
man Concert displayed excellent
showmanship along with brilliant.
solo and section work.

Incidentally, as things stand
now, Woody Herman’s sponsors
are planning a six-week -box-top
contest to be climaxed by award-
ing the winner the whole 19 piece

TNT

By Teddy Termite

I was in the library the other
day. Not to get a book, of course,
but "because I’d beenfollowing a
cute redhead and she disappear-
ed around a corner on the fifth
ﬂoor. I stuck my proboscis in the
reference room, but nothing pres-
ent was either cut or redheaded.
There were some students there,
however, and I asked one gangling
youth how he happened to be in
the library.

"I was left out at registration”,
he told me. “I’m waiting for the
next semester to start so I can be-
gin attending -classes. These easy
chairs are quite comfortable and
well, you know the housing situa-
ltion at present.”

The librarian started looking at
me sorta funny so I asked her
whether she had a copy of
“Bucket Technique During The
Slopover Regime”. She told me
she didn’t. I heaved a sigh of re-
lief and left. I may be a worm, but
I’m no ‘bookworm.
