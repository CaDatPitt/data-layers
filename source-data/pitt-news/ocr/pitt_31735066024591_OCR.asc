Saxon made this comment at the

of_ nationwide fervor over the cuts.

   

The group is aiming at “coordinat-

Specifically, the coalition has
established two primary objectives:
to “organize a local demonstration’?
scheduled for June 6 in conjuction
with demonstrationsthe same dayin

urging them to support the .lune 6
demonstrations.

The coalitions are‘ part of a

activities such asan April l4demon-

“People do not want another Viet
Nam. They do not want to go to war.
lt will be our children who will have
to go, and they won’t go,"-said Carol
McAllister, a member of the El Sal-
vador Mobilization Committee, at a
press conference at the University
and City Ministries building in Oak;
land. yesterday.

The Committee is made up of
representatives from concerned
organizations throughout the city
who are disturbed by the recent deci-
sion ofthe Reagan administration to
restore and increase U.S. military _
aid to El Salvador. They believe that
it is a dangerous step toward the.»
involvement-of the United States in
another Viet Nam-type conflict.
Thus far, the Reagan administration
has authorized $35.million in aid to
El Salvador in l98l alone. That total

.is seven times the amount offered by

Jimmy Carter in l980, according to

“The philosophy they (the Com-

years is a stress on democracy,” said
Marzani. “More and more partici-

“Italy today is’ importing food,

Marzani. “No one wants to be a

loyal power in Italy that. suggests
this is the Communist Party. They
say, ‘Let's go onto the land.’

“The ltalian- Communist Party is
much more committed—they want
to make change,” he said, “com-

“What is danger and what is cru-

hopelessness and despair people
have all over the world."

He, commented that this is s result
of “a dying culture” andja “two-

political leaders as research for his

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 25, 1981

Created following Prohibition 48
years ago, t_he LCB is the largest sin-
gle purchaser of liquor in the United
States, with sales last year of$663.3
million. '

The new board would-operate the
liquor wholesale buisness which the
state would continue to control. The
number of warehouses would be
expanded from the current five to l0
to l3 throughout the state.

“I could be happy with either one,
but l would prefer the state to be out
of the wholesale buisness as well,”
said Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, R-
Montgomery, who is sponsering the
measure along with Sen. Richard
Tilghman, R-Montgomery.

Greenleaf said he will support an
ammendment by Sen. James Kelley,
D-Westmoreland, to , get the state
out ofthe wholesale liquor buisness.

Greenleaf says he plans an April
l5 public hearing on the plan in his
Senate Law and Justice Committee.
It should be ready for senate action
around May I3, he said.

Among those supporting the gov-
ernor‘s plan is Senate Republican
Leader Robert Juberirer who said,
“In all liklihood I believe it will pass
with the state still in the wholesale
buisness.”

State Democratic Leader Edward
Zemprelli is withholding his support
until assured by the.adm'inistration

 

the 3500 state store clerks and man-
agers won’t be turned out into the
streets. _

The student Ad- Hoc Committee on Financial Aid is conducting petition
and letter writing campaigns in order to persuade Congress to reject Presi-

distributed by the three student go verments, the governance groups, and the
"graduate student organizations with thecolleges. These petitions will then b_e
presented to a local Congressman in a press conference next month.
Students,facult_i’,' staf/§ and parents are asked to write letters to their U. S.
Congressman and two U. S. Senators explaining why we oppose ~Reagan"s
cut toward higher educatioh. All Pennsylvania residenti should write to both
Senator Heinz and Senator Specter. The map ofthe state and corresponding

We, members ofthe University of

 concerned about the reductions and

“Program for Economic Recovery.”

Pitt students have faced tuition
increases that have placed students,
as well as their parents, in an increas-
ingly difficult situation. The pro-
posed budget reductions and

restrictions will place an inordinate '

burden on students, their families,

     Protecting
Victims  

House bills 509 and 213, awaiting consideration in
the House Judiciary Committee, are “designed to pre-
serve the confidentality between the victim and the
rape counselors.” " '

What defense attornies in rape cases would like to
do is obtain the records made by rape counselors in
meeting with the victims. Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape (PAAR) won a Supreme Court ruling in the
matter. The Supreme Court ruled that the only way
information at counseling session couldbe admissable
if it were recorded verbatim.

In a related story in the Monday, March 23, 198] -
issue of The Pitt News, PAAR director Ann Pride
stated that she was pleased with this ruling, ‘since the
sessions were never recorded verbatim, but cases have
arisen across the sta-te where this insubstantial evi-
dence was released for use in rape trials.

Now the matter is being taken to the legislature,
where, should it pass, would insure the rape victims of
more confidentiality. A - '

Opponents of the bill.feel that it is unconstitutional
under the sixth amendment, which gives the defendent

the right to any imformation_availab1e‘to his/her
'defense. '

Confidentialityvhas beenas pressing a problem with
rape as the rape itself. ‘Who can blame a victim's
reluctance to follow through proper legal channels
after a rape, when the process could, and oftne times " ‘
does turn out toibe as 4 traumatic and harrowing as
the crime. - ‘  A .

Pennsylvania state Re resentative Ron Cowell, a t
supporter of the House Bills, says the defense attornies
“do not know what is in the files, but they look for ~
inconsistencies made b.y theivictim.“ A

Much too often the credibility of the victim is held
up _for scrutiny. “Innocent until proven guilty" is the
maxim of the legal system of this land, yet many times
it seems as if the victim is subject to the inverse applica-
tion of this rule.

"There is no constitutionality in the exploitation ofa
rape victims anguish and trauma. A rape counselor‘s
job is to assist the victim in their recovery from this
brutal crime; to hopefully prepare the victim to follow

through with the legal process so often overlooked by C I .

those too upset or ashamed to have the ordeal re-
hashed. The expression ofthe victim’s fears and anxie-
ties to a counselor is a rehabilative process, and not
one that could be adversely used. The victim is not on
trial, the rapist is.  _ H
The victimized have been hurt enough by the crimi-
nal act. They need not be dragged through the mud of
shame oncemagain in their hope that justice could be —
‘_ done, and others could be spared by the same harro’w-.;
ing experience. When a rape v_i'ctim_has, enough assu-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 25, 1981

Dear Editors:

There maybe some unwarranted
confusion about my Honors Lecture
as it was reported in the March l5
issue of Pitt News. Let me summar-
ize what I thought l said. '

l. Roosevelt's New Deal had to
cope with high unemployment, low
rates of investment, and a long‘ his-
toric tendency towards falling prices
(price deﬂation). lriventories were so
large that employers were choosing
to produce very "little and were
investing. particularly slowly".

2. New Deal economic policies).

sought to encourage consumption
by transferring goods and'purchas-
ing power.to'the poor. They also
intended to make the federal‘ govern-
ment the “investor of the last resort”
(if private parties did not invest
enough, the federal government
would try to make up the differ-
ence). The_ dangers of deflation
(associated with low cionsumptionof
goods and repeatedly postponed
investment) were so apparent that
fears of inflation were all but put
aside. ‘ “ — A

-ln Atlanta, the murders continue -—
as 20 children are dead and two are ‘

reported missing. The city task force

still has no clues or suspects on who.

may have killed the children, and
there is turmoil in the city.

_ Tl1e.Reagan administration has
okayedithe request by Atlanta offi-
cials for $1.5 million to finance the
investigation. President Reaganihas
expressed his concern by calling the

killings “one ofthe most tragic situa-_

tions that has ever confronted‘-an
American city." ; C

A The mysterious killings have been-

~a tragedy for" the nation. but the
agony is unbearable for black Amer-_
icans. There is a sense df helplessness
and desparations lining the heartslof
blacksgthroughout the country. But
they are continuing in their efforts to
show and give support to the grief’-
strieken families as. anxiety. fear.

and suspicion intensify within the I‘
1 , black communities. ' ' “

V “demand management”,

3. Basically these New Deal eco-
nomic policies, called by some
were
pursued successfully from the mid-
l930’s until the: late l960's. (Qnly
during World War II did the inﬂa- ,
tionary spectre become a bigthing).
The l950’s and the l960’s were eco-
nomically good times for many rea-
sons (including increased American 7
pa_rtic_ipati,on in foreign _ trade);;
employment rose, private irivest- .
ment levels were high, and the inﬂa—; A
tionary drift was small. But _.by' the
end of the'l960‘s and the early l970‘s
demand management policies were
becoming less -successful. -

C 4. Why? The federal government
was ‘financing its purchasing power-
and other,.transfer‘programs out of
income _' taxation and borrowing,
and doing so drained funds from the
sources private industry used (this is ‘
called the “crowding out” effect).
Beyond that, at least two other
things were happening. The federal

’ government had mandated certain

economic program thus is an aban-_

donment of the demand manage-

both the tax-drain and the
borrowing-drain on private indus-
try. lt hopes that as these reductions
occur, investment ‘in American

. industry will increase. The commit-

ment to increasing defense expend-
ing is seen as an unavoidable ‘but

The Pitt Panther mens volleyball
team battled their way to a match
lossto the hands of the rival Nittany
Lions on Monday night at the Field
House. _

Pitt could not seem to stop the
precision ofthe Nittany Lions attack
and went down to defeat in the first
two games of the best of five match,
then rebounded to win the third.
Losses were by 4-15 and 13-15
before the Panthers fought back for

.an I8-I6 win. _The fourtli game,

which turned out to be the final of
the evening, was won by the Nittany
Lions l5-I0.

7 Despite the three losses, Panther
head ‘coach Ray Reilly kept an
optimistic attitude as he and his
team will now prepare for a league
match with George Mason and the
annual George Mason Invitational
tournament in Fairfax, Virginia
next weekend. The Panthers are idle
until that date.

“We don’t have the outside power
that Penn State does,” said Reilly,
“But we remained on that court with
them and weiplayed a respectable
match against them.,When l con-
sider the fact that Penn State is
pushing six scholarship athletes
against ‘Pitt, essentiallly a team of
walk—ons, I think that we played a
very respectable game on Monday."
Pitt currently offers no scholarship
for men’s volleyball.

The Panthers opened the night
very stiff, and lost in a one-sided
game. Led by the hitting of Ahmet

Ozcam, a member of the Turkish A—

National team, the Nittany» Lions
took total control of the game.

Penn State led the game at one
point by a score of 14-1 before win-
ning I5-4. Ozcam was always there,

“Allmet wasa big part ofthat first
game,” said Penn State coaclf Tom A
Tait. “We executed well with the

dimension to the team."

The Panthers were determined to
turn the tide when the teams
switched sides ofthecourt for the
second game. After being down 0-7
Pitt, with Danny O’Donnell serving
the ball, knotted the score at seven.
Penn State took over again - and
increased their score,to l l before the
Panthers scored again. The game
see-sawed back and forth until it was
again tied at 13.. Unfortunately for

the Panthers, the Nittany Lions
pulled away to win 15-13.

“After the first game we dropped
our intensity level enough so that
our transitions weren’t smooth and
we didn’t take advantage of the
plays,” Tait said. “The drop in inten-
sity cost us some points. A few non
aggressive blocks against a team
that’s shooting quick at you, like
Pitt, can allow you to lose a lot of
points.”

Pitt opened scoring for the first
time/in the third game and fought to
two ties at three and four points

Chipman Signs Kentucky~»Stari e

:3».

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
/issislmil Sports Editor

Pitt continued to strengthen its
committment to big-time basketball
by inking yet another highly-touted
high school player of reputation.
Pitt head ‘coach Roy Chipman,
announced yesterday the signing of
Chip Watkins, a 6'6 forward from
Louisville. Reputed to be the
second-best player in Kentucky,

"Watkins turned down offers from

DePauI, Tennessee and Western
Kentucky to come to Pitt. Pitt assist-
ant coach Reggie’ Warford spoke
highly of the new recruit.

“Watkins is an extremely quick,

player who can play either power-‘
forward or small-forward. He has a.

good shooting touch from I5 feet on
in," Warford said. “He’s as quick as
Lennie McMillian, with better
offensive_potentiaI.”

Playing for Doss High School in

V Louisville, Watkins averaged 21.5

points a game and grabbed 14.4
rebounds a game.
The Watkins signingis the first of

the two expected to occur this week,’

according to Pitt assistant coach

     
 

 

Seth Greenberg. Jeff Hofﬂer, 6'9
center from ‘New Haven, Connecti-
cut, isvisiting Pitt this week.
Hoffler, is another player Piss is
hotly recruiting. Considered by
many as. one of the top three centers
in the country, Hoffler has already

faced Pat ‘Ewing, generally consi--

dered the top high school player in
the nation, and played him toia vir-
tual draw, as each scored 18 points.

To add to that Hofﬂer ‘was-named
tournament MVP as his high school
team recently won the state cham-
pionship. Hoffler said he has already

narrowed his‘ choices to Pitt,f

Duquesne or LSU, but does not
expect to announce his decision

until sometime later in the month-

_Hoffler’s academic transcripts,
which com-e out soon, could play an
important role in where he can
attend college. .

.The next signing up could be a
6-foot guard who reportedly can do

a 360 degreedunk and is regardedas

the top guard in New York City._l-Iis
name is George Allen and Pitt has
devoted —a great deal of effort to land

him. V r- « «

According to Warford, Allen has
“unlimited potential,” and with the

- graduation of Dwayne)WaIla_ce-after

next year, Pitt is hoping that he can

fill the void at point guard. Allen has .

narrowed his choices toiPitt or
Drake. _
Watkins joins Roosevelt Kirby
and Charles Thompson as the
Panthers I981 recruits so far. The

next couple of days may well be.the .

most important for Pitt recruiters.

would not divulge the identity of the-

three players, he did say that George

players.

yesterday, Chipmaii said he expects .

Allen to sign with Pitt.

The signing of Chip Watkins
hammers home a point that Chip-

make: Pitt Panther basketball is.

Opening Day of   
Football Drills \ 

By JOHNETTE HOWARD‘

‘Pill News Sparls Editor

The Pitt Panther football'team
opened its spring practice session
Monay afternon at Pitt Stadium
withvlight contact drills. Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill and hisstaff concen-
trated mostly on defense at the
initial workout. Apparently Sherrill’

I is wasting no time in beginning the

major overhaul that faces him on the

defensive side of the .line with the

loss of nine of last year’s starters.
Although it was only the first day

of practice, some of the answers to. ‘

* the surrounding several positions on
both offense and defense were at
least hinted at how the coaches may
be leaning at the moment.

Senior Emil Boures, who Pitt is
touting as an All-America possibil-
ity this year, was working out at cen-
ter as well as his customary offensive

.-‘guard position. At Monday’s noon ,

press conference, Sherrill ‘said he
may‘ experiment with Boures at-cen-
ter during the spring as a possible
candidate to fill the void left by the
-loss of last year’s starter Russ
Grimm. The incomming talent of
this year’s recruiting crop, especially
offensive offensive‘ ’ linemen Bill

Fralic ‘of Penn Hills. and ~ All-East‘

player Bob Brown, from Massach"u-

setts, could ease the trans-ition of

Boures to center in the fall. _
Sherrill said at the conference that

~ Pitt’ will concentrate heavily on tech- _ _

niquevduring spring drills, due to the

inexperience of this year’s squad‘.

which returns only eight seniors and
30 lettermen. - ‘ i . - '

Brown, who Sherrill said, has “a lot

of ability, but needs to put on some

weight,” ran through drills with the
first team on Monday, as did junior

Pitt News Sports Writer

When .woImen‘s athletic director
Sandy Bullman hired Judy Saurer as
head coach of the Pantherette bas-
ketball squad, she believediSaurer

- was the one to build a national pow-
, erhouse. ln one year, Saurer led the

squad to a 20-7 record, the best in
the history of the team. Although

the Pantherettes suffered a 91-80

loss to Rutgers in the first round of
EAIAW Regi nal play, the season
was deemed a success, both statisti-
cally and in drawing some national
attention to Pitt. Now, the Pan-
therettes‘ season has been extended;
they have accepted a bid to the

..National Women‘s lnvitational-
, Tournament (NWIT).

Pitt will face the Lady Bulldogs of
Georgia tomorrow night in Ama-
rillo, Texas. Georgia sports an over-
all record of 24-10. The Lady
Bulldogs finished third in the Sou-
theastern Conference Tournament,
upsetting nationally ranked Ken-
tucky 73-62 in the consulation game.
The Lady Bulldogs went on to wi_n
the Georgia AlAW State Touma-
ment, defeating Georgia Tech,
Albany State and Georgia Southern
.by comfortable margins. Then
Georgia suffered an 82-70 loss to
Alabama-Birmingham in the first
round of AIAW Region lll play at
the season’s end.

Following is a brief lookat the
personnel of both teams and how
they will match up on court.
GUARDS: Pitt has a slight edge at
this position. Although the Lady
Bulldogs are led by All-American
senior Bernadette Locke, they are
weak at the other guard postion.
Locke is averaging l0.9 points a

g game, with I65 assists and 90 steals

on the year. Locke’s complement,
Lou Sims, is a freshman with min-
imal experience. Sims put in 4.8
points a game, and she had 90 assists
and 79 steals on the year. As a tan-
dem, their biggest asset is their abil-
ity to steal.
However, Debbie Lewis is han-
dling the ball for the Pantherettes,
‘ and one rarely takes the ball from
the wizard’s hands. Lewis is averag-
ing l4.3 points a contest. She also

Aughburns also plays with finesse

vich pose a threat with the outside

BENCH STRENGTH: Georgia def-
initely takes the edgehere. The first
three players off the bench» for
Coach Andy Landers average 21.4‘
points as a, group. Pitt has a lot of
young talent on the bench, but
Saurer uses themsparingly, prefer-
ring to stay with the starters.

The key to the game for Pitt seems
to rest with the defense. Pitt must
shut off Locke and force the fresh-
man, Sims, to handle the ball for
Georgia. The Pantherettes are going
to have to get the defensive rebound,
or Georgia will put it in given the
second change.

Offensively, Pitt has the talent to
score on any defense Georgia might ,
play. ltfwould be to the team’s
advantage to work inside, since Hol-‘
loway and Collins have a tendency
to foul a lot. Pitt's experience aids
the "team in all facets of the game is *

freshman, ‘ a sophomore. and a

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 25, 1981

The All-Stars shot by the Cavaliers Monday night towin the independent division of the
basketball intramurals and advance into the Al_l-Campus tournament.

South Fruitful f or LadyTracksters  

“By MARIE um

Pill News Spnrls Wrifrr

The Pantherette track team did

more than pick up a tan at the Flor- ‘

ida Relays in Gainesville last week-
end. Fourrof/' the five Pantherettes

I

E that competed qualified to partici-

pate ‘in tehe , EAIAW Regional
Championships to be held at West
Chester State ‘College May 9-10.

Once again, the Pitt charge was
led by All-America sprinter Gwen
Murray. Murray captured top
honors in the 400 meter dash with a
clocking of 53.67. Her time qualified
here for both Division land Div-
ision ll Outdoor Nationals, as well
as setting a new Pitt record. The
senior speedster also ran a time of
24.4 in the trials of the 200 meter
dash, easily qualifying for the finals.
However, the finals of both events
fell within a thirty minute span, and
Murray elected to scratch from the
200 meter andrun her specialty, the
400 meter race. 5

“Gwen completed the first step for

‘ an invitation to Division l Nation-

als," explained coach Alfreeda Goff.

“First, she ran the qualifying stand-
ard. Now, she has to win the event at
the Division ll Nationals, since we
are a Division ll school."

Junior Peri Radeeic proved that
she has fully recovered from a back
injurythat kept her out of competi-
tion last year. Radecic heaved the
shot put 44"/2”, taking fifth-place.
The field specialist also hurled the
discus l32’2" for a seventh-place fin-

ish. lnboth events, Radeeicfell two '

feet short ofthe Pantherette records.
\ ' .

“I feel Peri had a good meet," said,
Goff. “We were a little hesitant
about entering her in the discus, but
she erased those doubts completely.

We knew she could handle the shot. —

put from her performance indoors.
We are hoping for big things from

her this season."

Kathy Dvorsak, a premier pent-

athelete in the East, qualified for

Easterns in the long jump and the ‘

I00 meter hurdles. Dvorsak leaped ‘a

distance of seventeen feet in the long _

jump and was clocked at l6.3,—her

personal best, in the hurdles.

According to Dvorsak, both her per-

formances can be improved substan-
tially. The sophomore hopes to
make these her strong points inher

outdoor specialty, the septathlon.'

That event consists of the hurdles,
shot put, highjump, longjump, and
800 meter run, (the events of the
indoor pentathlon), and the javelin
and 200 meter dash’. V 

Ro_unding out the Pitt contingent
in Florida were Sally Higgins and
Terri McKee. McKee crossed the

finsih ‘line with a time of I I : l2, quali- '
fying her for the Eastern Champion-

ships. Higgins aggravateda pulled
muscle, but finished the race with a
time of ll:49. However, ‘the’ injury
caused her‘ to miss qualifying for the
Easterns. Higgins will see limited
action in the next three weeks. '
