Robert Maier. allegedly expell-
ed from the Dental School be-
cause of his long hair. has tenta-
tively decided to abandon. dentis-
try for another course of study.

Maier said earlier this term that
he had been "expelled from the
School and told never to return."
Dr. Edward Forrest. Dean of the
Dental School. maintained that

' Maier‘s suspension was tempor-

ary. "at least untilhe cuts his
hair.“

MAIER: Pulls Out.

Maier. a first year dental stu-
dent. felt that his hair was not too
long and that he was not in viola-
tion of any rules of the Dental
School. "The rules that I suppos-
edly broke were supposedly list-
ed in the Student Manual.“ Maier
said. “Practically no one in the
Dental School has even seen this
book. let alone been given a
chance to study it. “

During Maier’s suspension, For-
rest sent him him a letter inform-
ing him that he would be subject
to dismissal. The letter also stat-
ed that Maier could, if he desired,
appear before a faculty commit-
tee to have his case reviewed.

The letter read: “You may elect
to have a hearing before a faculty
committee, at which time you will

have an opportunity to present
evidence and to question and wit-
nesses who testify against you.
Such a committee would consider
the case and give me their rec-
ommendations for action."

The Dean considered the hear-
ing proposal a “legitimate at-
tempt" to establish communi-
cation between the student and
the Dental School.

Maier declined the offer, feel-
ing it was unjust. “They didn’t
give me a chance to present any
witnesses on my behalf,” he ex-
plained.

On March 26. Maier called For-
rest and asked him for an appoint-
ment to talk about the matter.
Because of any injury. Forrest
was unavailable. Maier did. how-
ever. meet with Dr. Arthur W.
George. associate dean and direc-
tor of the Dental Clinic.

George described the discus-
sion as "fruitful.“ "A lot was ac-
complished." he said. "He
(Maier) even cut his hair before
he came to see me.“

“At the meeting, we discussed
his career and after a one and a
half hour discussion, we came to
the conclusion that dentistry was
not really what Maier wanted.”

George said that Maier was en-
tering the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) to '-‘re-examine
his career“ and to pursue his in-
terest in the development of peo-
ple. George added that he had
cleared Maier‘s transfer with
CAS Dean Jerome Schneewind
and that he was trying to get a
refund of the Dental School tui-
tion for Maier.

Maier was less pleased with
his talk with Dr. George. “Noth-
ing has changed at the Dental
School,“ he said. “If nothing
else. they have become more rig-
id. After getting my hair cut once.
I was told to get it cut again."

Should Maier's tuition be re-
funded, he plans to take some
graduate courses in the College.
If unable to get his money back.
Maier plans to finish the year at
the Dental School.

Senate Vote Looming

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor

(Editor's Note: For an editorial on
the Arsenal, see page four.)

The Arsenal Family and

Children's Center in Law-
renceville has won a new lease
on life from Chancellor Wesley
Posvar.

Until Thursday. the Center —
which educates about 45 pre-
school children. trains graduate
students from several of the Uni-
~versity's Schools and conducts
research—feared it would be
forced to close June 30.

In a Wednesday memo, how-

ever, Posvar committed the Uni- .

versity to “faculty support at ex-
isting levels” for five years (ap-
proximately $86,000 per year)
“on the condition that outside
sources are found that can com-
mit a funding level of $80,000 per
year for the next five years” for
staff salaries previously funded
by the Medical School and the
School of Health-Related Profes-
sions.

Appearing at the Center
Thursday, H. Steele Gow, Dean
of the Division of Instructional
Experimentation, urged friends
of Arsenal to "try every source
everybody knows“ to secure at
least $100,000 annually for the
next five years.

GOW OPTIMISTIC

Gow also announced that the
Arsenal will henceforth be under
his jurisdiction at the order of
Chancellor Posvar. In an inter-
view later. Gow said he was "con-
fident we can raise the neces-
sary outside funds."

A committee from Arsenal was
scheduled to meet with Dr. Pos-
var this morning to express the
Centers appreciation for the Uni-
versity‘s support and its hope for
money from private foundations.

Arsenal’s financial crisis, an-
ticipated for months, was pre-
cipitated by the Medical School’s
decision to discontine paying the
salaries of non-academic person-
nel at the Center as of June 30,
1971.

House-Rejects Early Draft

by MIKE MILLER

The House of Representatives
rejected Wednesday a proposal
which would have ended the mili-
tary draft June 30. 1972. by a
vote of 200-108 (see page four
editorial).

The proposal. submitted by Rep-
resentative Charles Whalen (R..
Ohio). was an amendment to a bill
originating in the House Armed
Services Committee which rec-
ommended extending the draft
through mid-1973 and included
provisions for increases in mili-

tary pay.

Observers in Washington were

surprised by theextensive bipar-
tisan support which the amend-

  

   

 
  

the proposal were not expected to
exceed 175.

A spokeswoman for Represen-
tative Teno Roncalio (D., Wyo.),
a supporter of the amendment,
stated that some votes could have
come from “insurgents” who had
earlier suffered a crushing defeat

on an amendment to end the draft V

in three months.

The spokeswoman also sug-
gested that the vote reflected a
"cry for responsive action "by the
people who are no longer satisfied
with the governments stand pat
attitude;

It was rumored that a number‘
- of congressmen voted against .the

draft in protest of the Calley deci-

 

Representative John J. Flynt
(D., Geo.), a Bronze Star winner
who had never voted against a
military bill, voted in favor of the
amendment, stating that he could
not support the war when the U.S.
did not have the will to win the
war or end it. -

Observers felt that if the legis-
lation had passed the House it
would have had an easier time in
the Senate.

Frank Cook. legislative assis-
tant to Senator Mark Hatfield (R.
Ore.). stated that there would

have been "a good chance for
stopping induction by June 30.
1971." had the bill passed the
House.

   

,,.,I,ohnson:;and Bow not vote.

Since Dean Donald Medearis of
the Medical School announced that
decision, Gow has tried with lit-
tle success to obtain funds from
other schools at the University.

"Its a very bad year to try to
get money from Deans," Gow ob-
served Thursday. “Everybody’s
operating on an extremely tight
budget this year because of the
financial crisis."

MED SCHOOL’S RATIONALE

Explaining the Medical School's
decision, Dean Medearis said,
“The Medical School should not
run a pre-school school." He add-
ed that the Medical School will
continue to support “that part of
the (Arsenal) program that is

THE ARSENAL Center in Lawrenceville.

necessary for the education of
medical students."

Margaret McFarland, Arsen-
al’s director, expressed no bitter-
ness over Medearis’ decision.
“Every professional person has
his line of professional interest
and he has to be faithful to that,”
she said. '

According to Gow, the Chancel-
lor‘s decision to bail Arsenal out
stemmed partially from the fact
that Arsenal’s staff and the par-
ents of the children “started mak-
ing a big noise” when told the
Center was nearlclosing.

The Pitt News learned that
five members of the Advisory

Demise

House passed a bill extending the
draft through mid 1973, increas-
ing military pay and giving the
President the authority to end
student deferments.

The President stated that stu-
dents who had received or applied
for deferments prior to April 23.
1970. would not not lose them.

The bill passed by a vote of 293-
99 with area congressmen, Moor-
head, Gaydos, Clark, Morgan,
Saylor, Whall«ey,Vigorito, M0110-
han, Staggers and Carney voting
in favor of the bill.

Congressmen Fulton, -Hechler
and Hays voted against the bill
and Representative Corbett, Dent,

  

University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, Pa,

april 5, 1971

Committee on Women's Oppor-
tunities (ACWO) urged the Chan-

scellor Tuesday to take action to
keep Arsenal open—another pos-
sible impetus.

Also, renowned Harvard psy-
chologist Erik Erikson reported-
ly wrote recently to the Chan-
cellor urging him to keep the
Center open.

Erikson, along with Dr. Benja-

min Spock, helped found the Cen-
ter 18 years ago. ' '

MORE PITT PEOPLE

In his memo Dr. Posvar said .
Arsenal must “move to establish _
tuition scales for the Center bas-
ed upon need and labilityto pay.”
Currently, tuition"is approximate-
lv $5 per week—much lower than

most day-care centers. Tuition
rebates will continue to go to the
needy.

The Chancellor also stipulated
that “to the extent feasible and
compatible with the mission of
the Center, the future composi-
tion of the student body should be
comprised of children of mem-

bers of the University commun-

ity whose professional or job

needs require. child care assis- I

tance.”

Interpreting that move, Gow
told Arsenal personnel Thursday
that the University “is under mas-
sive pressures from women’s
groups for day care centers.”
He said it would be “politically
helpful to the Chancellor” if more
Arsenal beneficiaries were “Pitt
people.” .

PITT is likely to receive no more
money for this fiscal year from
the State legislature than it
received last fiscal year, ac-'
cording to Vice Chancellor for
Finance Edison Montgomery.

The University, which has
received only $19 million thus
far this year——half of what it
received last year--is awaiting
word from the State legisla-
ture on its request for $41.5
million for the current fiscal
year.

“There is little hope of our
getting help for the current fis-
cal year other than the other
half of what we received last
year,” Montgomery revealed
Thursday.

Consequently, the Universi-
ty is likely to incur a deficit for
 th' fiscalyear. y 7

The Distinguished Teaching
Awards Committee. with a $4.000
budget. is working this week on
recognizing professors that stu-
dents feel are outstanding.

Chaired by Scott Baum. the
committee will award three $1.-
000 prizes to professors and two
$500 prizes to teaching assistants.

Though a student—faculty com-
mittee decides who gets the mon-
etary rewards. the recommenda-
tions come from the student body.
According to Baum. this gives
the students a chance to voice
their opinions. ' V g

“The award is based on excep-
tional teaching in a variety of
ways. Concern for students, con-
cern for learning, and evaluating
students in such a way that it is
not merely a grade but a teaching
and learning toolare all factors,”
he said.

The Course Evaluation is one
source. Personal contact with the

itself provides another.

Baum stressed repeatedly that
the Distinguished Teaching Award
is the only way students can re-
ward outstanding teachers and
that_the DTA is the only reward
that tries to show the criteria
for, distinguished teaching.

Nominations are being receiv-
ed now in 917 CL. Any faculty
member in CA8 may be nomin-
ated. including teaching assis-
tants. The nomination must in-
clude -some kind of supportive
material, telling why the parti-

and a monetary prize.

Nominations should be address-
ed to Scott Baum, written. and

Utley Envisions Black Focal Point

by JOHN WILBORN

Richard Utley. newly elected chairman of the
Black Action Society (BAS). has plans for the or-
ganization to represent blacks on campus in every
phase of University involvement.

Utley. a junior Political Science major. mem-
ber of the track team and president of Groove Phi
Groove Social Fellowship. was elected to the office
last week.

BAS CHAIRMAN and Deputy Chairman Richard Utley
Photo by Maris

"The original purpose of the BAS was to rep-
resent all blacks at the University and to help
blacks be in a more comfortable position in a white
environment," the chairman stated. “I mean for it
to be just that.“

To make BAS more effective on campus, Utley
plans to approach student and administration com-
mittees and ask that a black representative be plac-S
ed on each committee. Among these are Homecom-
ing, Student Publications, Allocations and Student
Affairs.

Utley said that he hoped to continue to
expand the success of the projects that BAS has
supported this year. A second Black Week. coordi-
nated by Bernard Mack. a newspaper and various
new committees are planned to keep BAS running
effectively.

The chairman expressed concern over them-
volvement of black students in BAS. "The organiza-
tion is supposed to speak for all blacks at the Unl-
versity. so I am asking for a representative from
each black fraternity, sorority and any other black
student and administrative organizations.

With Deputy Chairman Albert Watts, Utley will
begin finalizing plans for advisory seminars and a
baby-sitting service for black women who have to
take children to class with them.

Utley and Watts expect the BAS to become the
point around which all blacks at the University can
revolve.

"Blacks will come to the BAS when they have
problems and when they just want to know whats
happening.“ Utley said.

Utley was realistic about future projects plan-
ned by BAS. We can only accomplish what the ad-
ministration and students will help us work for.
Albert and I can't do it alone.“

‘in response to a letter concerning the termination of
-Assistant Professor James T. Kneafsey by the Econo-

investigated and perceived by the author.)

Assistant Professor James T. Kneafsey was brought
to the University in 1968 by Mark Perlman, then
Chairman of the Economics department. Kneafsey
taught courses in Industrial Organization and Mathe-
‘matical Economics while serving as a major advisor.
He had still to write his dissertation before completing
_his doctorate at Ohio State University. Many academi-
W cians begin their careers by leaving their home.insti-
" tution and writing their dissertation while in their first
years teaching at a new school. A stipulation in al-
‘most every such agreement is that the Assistant Pro-
fessor obtain his doctorate within a specified period of
time.

Kneafsey proved quite effective as both an in-

   Quality and/ or Certification?

rules of the American Association of University Pro-
fessors (AAUP) require that a non-tenured faculty mem-
ber be notified of his or her termination by Decem-
ber 15 of his or her final year under contract. Kneaf-
sey received his letter of termination from the Dean of
the Faculty’ of Arts and Sciences on December 15 and
the department began looking for someone to replace
him. By December 31, the Economics department had
received a letter from Kneafsey’s dissertation commit-
tee stating that his doctorate had been confirmed but
that some changes were to be made in the disserta-
tion. I

The dissertation was completed in February but
his status was undecided until it was put to a vote be-
fore the department’s tenured faculty late in the

Winter term. A majority of the tenured faculty voted -

not to renew Kneafsey for three years and thus the
Dean’s letter became binding. ‘

It is claimed by David Bramhall, a tenured fa-
culty member, that the meeting was called rather
hastily and that not all the faculty could be present
and that complete attendance might very well have
resulted» in another decision. '

THE LAW: SPIRIT AND LETTER

The letter of the law appears to have been vio-
lated. Professor Kneafsey, in, missing his dissertation
deadline, failed to completely abide by the rules of

-his contract. The Dean exercised his only remaining

option and the department’s tenured faculty exercised
their right in voting not to countermand the Dean’s
letter.

The question now concerns whether the spirit of
the law has been maintained. Again, the complexity
of the situation quickly presents itself as the most
probable qualification to an answer, if there is one.
However, before any evaluation can be made or even

attempted, the case of one other instructor merits con-
sideration.

Earl Adams is “one of the best teachers in the de-
partment” parenthesized in a letter to the editor from
Deborah Szwarc. Adams, a former Woodrow Wilson
and Brookings Institution fellow, came to the Univer-
sity from Amherst College in 1966. Adams had failed

,to complete his doctorate at M.I.T. because of some
very involved problems with his dissertation and he
was brought here by Mark Perlman as a teacher and
productive scholar, meaning that Adams would write
and publish as well as teach.

Adams has performed superlatively as a member I

of the faculty. Also acting as a major advisor, he has
demonstrated genuine concern for the student and has
contributed immensely to improving the advising and
registration procedures within the Economics depart-
ment. He has served as a member of ‘the University
facu1ty’s English Composition Committee and his
courses have the reputation of being both rewarding
and challenging; .

Unfortunately, Adams too has failed to completely
abide by his contract (he has one year remaining on

his second three-year contract and some decision as to .

his renewal must be made by December 15) and this
may result in his termination. Adams has not yet had
anything published. He has just recently completed a
joint paper with Michael Spiro of the Business School,
but they have not yet found a publisher. If Adams
is granted another contract, he will become a tenured
faculty member. The situation is, at best, awkward for
all concerned.

Again, the problem becomes one in which the let-
ter of the law is matched with the spirit of the law.
Here, this isolated situation becomes part of a much

%Arsenal Caught at Precipice

‘The Arsenal Family‘ and Children's Center
staged a demonstration this morning——but with an
odd twist. Meeting with Chancellor Posvar. an Ar-
senal contingent thanked him for saving the Center

Because most Arsenal students are selected
from a stable population base, research opportun-
ities for long-term study are exceptional. The Cen-
ter has worked assiduously to develop a rapport with
particular families, making follow-up investiga-
tions possible.

Arsenal also serves as a training center for
graduate students from several of the University’s
schools, including the School of Health-Related Pro-
fession th Medical School, and the School of
Child Care and Development. Ac-
cording to Steele Gow, Dean of
the Division ofllnstructional Ex-
perimentation, “No place that has
been using Arsenal has been dis-
sillusioned by it.” -

   

The Center has not yet realized
_ its full potential. Margaret Mc-
Farland, Arsenal’s director, agrees that Arsenal’s
"research productivity“ could be higher. Explain-
ing that many staff members have obligations out-
side the Center, she revealed that Arsenal hopes to
hire a full—time Research Director, “once our basic
problems are resolved."

The Pitt News endorses Chancellor Posvar’s at-
tempts to save the Center and commends him for
appreciating Arsenal’s worth.

We hope that the city’s financiers and the na-
tion’s foundations will be as generous as the Uni-
versity.

Calley The Scapegoat

by BOB GING
The recent conviction of
Lieutenant William Calley for
the premeditated murder of

Vietnamese civilians at My
Lai has sparked a furor around
the nation unmatched since the

invasion of Cambodia last
spring.

Many of those who have be-
come incencesed by the con-
viction feel that Calley was

serving his country by killing
those unarmed civilians. They
feel that what Calley did was
right. because he did it for the
best interests of his country-.

Others feel that Calley was
merely a scapegoat for military
and civilian higher-ups and that
his confiction was staged to
quiet dissent in this very vocal
and trying time. and this possi-
bility seems more likely.

In the wake of the Calley de-
cision, this writer spoke with
many Vietnam veterans con-
cerning the confiction. One vet
explained that “its not the men,
because no matter who you
are, when you’re in the ‘War,’
you’re a different person.”

He pointed to the basic train-

ing period which every GI
undergoes and explained that
for the "entire time you're
going through basic. you‘re
conditioned to react the way
Calley reacted.“

At the Ann Arbor Peace

Treaty Convention. Rich Thorn-
gate. Vietnam vet and member
of the Winter Soldier Investiga-
tion told how he had posed for
a picture with the head of a
slain enemy in his hand. He
claimed that atrocities of this
nature occur every day. and that
it is the nature of the war that
makes men this way.

So what of Calley? Sentenced
to life improsonment, and tem-
porarily repreived by Presiden-
tial order, one wonders what
crime he committed. Was the
crime volunteering to act in
what he considered a service to
his country? After all, Calley
had little to do with starting the
war, or with carrying it on for
almost twenty years. Calley
played a very small part in the
deaths of almost a million peo-

ple who have died since the-

war began.

No. Calley was the scape-
goat. He was the way out for
politicians who think more of
politics than they do of human
life. He was the salve for the
conscience of all of the Cap-
tains. Majors. Colonels and Gen-
erals who set up the circum-
stances leading to My Lai.

At the end of World War II.
in our infinite wisdom and to
amend the wrongs of the defeat-
ed powers. the United States
convicted a hierarchy of Ger-
man and Japanese military offi-
cials for the war crimes that they
had committed. We did not go
through the rank and file of the
German and Japanese military
officials for the war crimes that
they committed. We did not
go through the rank and file of
the German and Japanese mili-
tary establishments to persecute
the individual officers who com-
mitted the atrocities. because
they were merely acting under
orders. .,

Calley too was acting under
orders, but he was convicted to
life for following them. The
real criminals have escaped,
because that small Southeast
Asian nation will never win
and be in a position to put them
on trial. The real criminals have

that it is not Calley who is or-

sometimes have more destruc-

has ordered the unsuccessful

They’ve taken on any attempt
they see that exploits women as
sex objects. Therefore, protract-
ed war has been made on beauty

Of course the merit of these
attacks is debatable! But once
success is obtained here, will
the paranois continue? Will

yet, will these self—annointed

These

were all conjured up by some

male chauvinist anyway. For
example; it’s obvious that the
mini skirt and hot pants ex-
ploit the females leg like it
was a side of beef.

Well, if it is obvious, it is to
Women’s Lib and they feel man
should stop forcing women to
wear such garb, expecially in

public.

These female warriors rea-
lize that to succeed in their
revolution they must go fur-
ther and destroy the causes for
such attempts at female slavery.

For example, they'll probably
demand that romantic love must
go because it prescribes an in-
ferior female role.

Also, sexual attraction must
go because it defines woman by
her biology. And finally, to be
fair to both partners in bed.
some might even demand that
we always make love on our
sides.

But is this enough? Will
these actions calm their fears
about sexist oppression? To

some sisters. who should like
they hate their bodies and their
babies more than they do men,
these cosmetic “liberal reforms”
are hardly enough.

Toisatisfy their insatiable de-
mands, it seems we'll have to de-
stroy life itself. The apparent
reason why is because love
makes women cater to those
they love. It's a useless illusion
anyway.

So according to the radical
game plan, spring with its love
rituals, courtships, and love-
making, would be the last bas-
tion of male chauvinism. The
real troopers of the feminist
struggle realize the seige of
this last sexist fortress begins
today.

These amazons who want to
go all out to win the revolu-
tion understand their struggle
is not a bourgeois war between
the sexes. It‘s a war to destroy
sex itself.

So, if 1984 ever comes, it
seems that many in Women’s
Lib hope that women will
finally be “educated” to act
according to the prescriptions
of their radical “Victorian im-
age.”

Then women and even men

will supposedly be free. That‘s_

right, by acting like sexless
prudes we will somehow be able
to live with each other. This
will be our new freedom from
ourselves to be ourselves. Right
on?

But did these super women of
Women’s Lib ever ask the “vie-
tim” if she wanted to _be saved?
Did they ask any of us?

No, these moral demagogues
are telling us. I want no part
_of such freedom. And I'm sure
all those girls who wear minis,
hot pants, and even maxies,
agree with me, too.

We who believe in freedom
to be ourselves should fight for
a spring revolution. We should.
defend natures law which says
if we want—more freedom we
need more leg.

Hopefully if we win, this
spring will be like all springs
of old with their fantasies and
love rituals. Men will look for
mini skirts and hot pants, too.

With the accompanying pair of V

legs dangling from these patches
of cloth. Women will feel fem-
inine and sought after..

And if these attitudes and
hopes produce nostalgia for tra-
ditional roles for men and wo-
men in love, so be it. ’

so on this beginning of the

rebirth of life, I beg you girls

in the struggle, leave this male
chauvenist one last fantasy, the
love of spring.

Some "Savory Satie, I 

A Bit Of Bad Bach

by A. J. spoxo

The lrreverent Inspirations of Eric
Satie (Angel 36713) Lamour-
eux Concerts Orchestra, Aldo Cic-
colini.

"Erik Satie is alive and well
and living on Angel Recordings.“
Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration.
but not as far as Angel recordings
are concerned. Here we have the
sixth volume in its continuing se-
ries of this relatively unknown
French composers music.

This present recording intro-
duces us to piano and orchestral
pieces. songs. and even a farcical
comedy from the pen of this early
20th century eccentric. All of the
songs and pieces are of an unbe-
lievable Webernian brevity (18
pieces in 20 minutes on side one).
each bearing its own programtic
distinction ("The Puppets Are
Dancing.“ "The Hats Air." “The
Cats Song“ just to name a few».

As far as artistry is concerned.
Nicholai Gedda is. by far. the
shining star on this disc. His ren-
ditions of the five tenor songs
show an intimate understanding
of Satie‘s unoretenious style

which makes these pieces perfect
of "musique de salon."

The flip side of this disc intro-
duces Satie as playwright through
his pre-theatre of the absurd com-
edy “Baron Medusa’s Trap.”

The dances comprising the mu-
sical portion of this play are socr-
ed for clarinet. trumpet. trom-
bone. violin. cello. bass. and per-
cussion and are rather reminis-
cent of Stravinsk_y‘s “Story of a
Soldier.“

This listener certainly appreci-
ates the placing of such unusual
fare upon his table and is eagerly
awaiting the next course la la

Pitt News Drama Critic

 

It is no secret that one of my major interests is
“Education in Theatre.” The Studio Theatre. there-
fore. has been a main focus of attention for me. And
as the year comes to a close. a source of great sat-
isfaction. y

Such a conclusion is justified for no other reason
than the growth of the facility itself as a more
meaningful. purposeful. and better utilized instru-
ment for the presentation of drama at Pitt and of its
members who are students of the craft.

The Studio Theatre is experimental in nature
and therby appears as a show case of a growing
theatre program. Its directors. administrators and
performers are all students and whatever suc-
cesses or failures it has are reflections of the edu-
cational process from which its members are bene-
fiting and maturing.

Dr. George Bogusch, advisor, has been a major
guide and influence in making this year happen. I
am sure I echo his and the entire department’s
pride in such productions as The Maids. Antigone.
Under Milkwood. The Victims. At the Hawks Well.
The. Fantastics. and others. Much growth.has tak-
en place under his direction; there is a definite and
separable sign of learning that has taken place. The
members themselves have become independent.

This independence is in the form of responsi-
bility for their own endeavors. When any group be-
gins to push away from its teachers and work on its
own and produce better things coming from them-
selves. then not only are their teachers illuminated.
but the members themselves begin to be examples
of "what its all about."

In this instance it is the Studio Theatre which
has come into its own as a major source of enter-
tainment for the University—as a major example
of what happens when people learn. mature. and be-
come more skilled in a media which can then be
their own source of fulfillment.

During the year, the selection of plays has been of
excellent and interesting variety. The areas of pu-

A Final Note 

{ii

blicity, costuming, scenic design, have shown much
improvement.

The theatre has been utilized in more creative"

ways in staging and technical areas. The Country.‘

Wife (the winter terms last production) saw a pro-
cenium stage_ in a theatre that was built just for
this kind of flexibility and finially utilized in sucha
manner.

Perhaps most impressive have been the per-

formers themselves..There seems to be a whole . I‘ V

new group of people out there on stage. Those who

once floundered with their lines are now confident ‘

and impressive. Those who could hardly move‘,
across the stage. whose faces could hardly show ex-
pression. now bristle with technical skill and grace. _

People like Dennis Grossman, Tom Spinella, Ber"

Nemitz, Francine Nemitz, Kathy DeVecka, Marl"  A

Huberman, Jeff Boudov, Sherry Caldwell, Kennetl
Neal, Valerie Ososky, Rick Applegate, Linda Lox-
terman, Alice LaRosa, Bill Campbell and others
have graced the stage “better” each time they’vt‘
appeared. ‘

As a director Richard Jakiel has continually pro

duced fine and finer examples of his growing abil- I

ity to handle the media.

As a playwright Bert Nemitz continues to per 1
better and richer products of his talent. These are ;
the people who have been before audiences for the

past year and who. by their own efforts. have caused
the Studio Theatre to capture admirers in larger
numbers than ever before. It is with these people

that I take pride and it is to their theatre that I call _

attention.

It has been my function to be the reviewer. It i
has been my delight to note this growth. It is my re- '

ward. as a critic. to have been there to see it hap-

pen (and at the University Theatre as well). What  I 1‘

was once a relatively obscure and internal hap-
pening in the basement of the Cathedral. has be-
come a source of satisfaction for the University and

general theatre community as well. The Studio The; 

atre shines brightly on its own.

by CHARLES LEVINE
Drama Staff

Dr. George Bogusch and his
Speech 123 class. in their pro-
duction of The Country Wife.
created a spectacle which in its
excitement and vitality seemed
to contain something appealing
to all. True to the Elizabethan
ideal they attempted to simulate,
the production in its complexity
and diversity was appealing to
“the elite, the court. the para-
sites, and pretenders“ of society.

The atmosphere of seventeenth
century England seemed to per-
vade the winding hallways of
the cathedral (or at least the
ground floor). Its robust style
did not even wait for curtain
time, as early arrivals were
greeted personally by the cast
in their incredibly elegant cos-
tumes, treated to a background
of chamber music and refresh-
ed by “the orange wenches".

(Kathy DeVecka and Valerie
Os‘osky).

'C0untry lVife’ Creates Elegant Air

It is obvious that the main
power of this production was its
depiction of the glamour and
grace of the restoration period;
one in which the robust Eliza-
bethan Theatre was intermingled
with the French emphasis on
scenic background.

In this ‘sense. the set designed

"by Henry Heymann was excep-

tional. It seems no details were
omitted as his elaborate recrea-
tions were exact down to the
sliding scenery and footlights.
This is the first time Pitts
Studio Theatre has been utiliz-
ed in such a manner. as Hey-
mann's set involved a complete
redecoration. Visually and tech-
nically it was most successful.

HISTORIC STYLES

As the program states the cos-
tume is an inescapable part of
the acting style of the period.
The costumes, under the super-
vision of Lynne Hemingway.
were fantastic. Everything was
there from colorful gowns ‘to

av

nightgowns. weapons. and assort-
ed wig styles. I

The credit, however, must go
to Dr. Bogusch and his Historic
Acting Styles Class. It must be
remembered that this was an
educational endeavor and the
c|ass’s research into the man-
ners and customs of the times
obviously paid off. The excite-
ment Bogusch and cast pro-
duced outweighed a play which
at times seemed repetitive and
dull. This “slowness” might
have been a result of the lengthy
plays of the era and the refine-
ment” of twentieth century
taste. ‘

However most of the weaker
points in the play were follow-
ed by brighter moments which
reawakened the audience some-
what. Just prior to intermission
when most of the audience seem-
ed bordered on‘ drowsiness.
Marilyn Plotkins' “Irish Lilt"
perked things up throughwher
refreshing and creative presenta-
tion. »

The comedy was certainly
played for all it was worth. Hen-

ry Luba (Mr. Pinchwife) was
outstanding and deserves much
credit for involving the audience
in the plot. His manner was not
only funny and authentic. but
contagious. as the audience
would noticably react at all his
entrances. He handled the aside
most effectively and had an ob-
vious rapport with the audience.

MORALS . . .

Also relating well to the audi-
ence were Kenneth Neal Neal
(Mr. Sparkish); and Mark Hu-
berman (Mr. Horner). In a play
where "the only morals were
manners“ the style of these two
was supurb. As Huberman hop-
ped from bedchamber to bed-
chamber. with numerous ladies
of sophistication. his roguish air
was unmistakable.

Jeffrey Boudov. with his ex-
cellent English accent and style
was very effective in the pre-
sentation of the prologue. as
well as in his own part (Mr.
Harcourt). Sherry Caldwell
(Lady Fidget) and Helen Lip-
chey (Mrs. Pinchwife) were
stimulating as the ladies of
court.

Lipchey’s facial expressions
and mannerisms were very -well
done as she captured the “wit”
of a dominated Elizabethan fe-
male. Sherry Caldwell was de-
finitely “a lady” in all senses
and her delightful song (written
by Marilyn Plotkins) was very
well done as was her epilogue.

In fine support were Marilyn
Plotkins, and Douglas Coates.
who as Sir Jasper generated his
own humor with his zany ges-
tures.

Michael McGeary (Mr. Dor-.
ilant) and Betty Knoke <Alithea)
seemed to suffer from the lack
of charm and grace needed for
their parts. Both merely recited
their lines. and generated no
excitement. Also the informal at-
mosphere might have been a
little overdone. as the audience
was almost encouraged not to
pay attention due to various
"side shows.“

In general the production was
a stimulating experience and
very well staged. The only real
drawback was my own fear of
laughing without style and so-
phistication.

performance.

Mr. Fox’s instrument was cer-
tainly no Flentrop but instead
what is described as the “Rodgers

speakers. His rendition of the
“Prelude and Fugue in D Major”
“beautifully” demonstrated ‘the

Fox's attempt to take Bach to
the masses is certainly a praise-
worthy effort but his philosophy
on how it is to be done leaves
something to be desired. Such an
attempt when approached cor-

'Eleplmnts’ and "Courageous Turtles’

by THOMAS NETTER

ELEPHANT BANGS TRAIN

..by William Kotzwinkle, $5.95
Random House

THE COURAGE OF TURTLES
by Edward Hoagland, $5.95
Random House

People like Irving Stone and

Charles Reich are in the news‘

a lot these days. and selling
books that are rather super-
fluous. They're hitting the top
of the best-seller list. making
all the reviews. and in general
taking up a lot of space that
they don't deserve.

Stone. for example. has just

released a book about Sig-
mund Freud (The Passions of
the Mind) that makes Kitch
look like Kultur. and would

serve as excellent ballast on a
garbage skow. Reich (The Green-
ing of America) with his idyllic
gleam and “pie in the sky"
philosophy wrote a sociological
Love Story with a happy ending.

It seem that ever since the
Yale student (Tom Wolfe) be-
came a success, the Yale Faculty
(Reich and Segal) seem to want
to prove that “all that comes
from Yale is not good” and that
you ought to get the pickings
while the pickings are to be
got. This doesn’t say much for
the state of letters this year.

Too much emphasis is put on
the demise of the short story
and the essay. while it seems
fashionable to think that any-
thing under 300 pages isn‘t
worth a damn unless it jerks
tears or has some sort of mixed-
up social message. This is why
reading Edward Hoagland and

William Kotzwinkle is so re-
freshing.

Elephant Bangs Train
short collection of stories by
Bill Kotzwinkle which has an
eye—catching cover and 14 sim-
ple mythical tales. According
to the cover of the book. Mr.
Kotzwinkle is a former depart-
ment store Santa Claus. Now
he's published the contents of
his bag. The stories lack any
real rationale other than that
they seem to be expositions of
literary genres. word games, and
fantastic tales.

MASTADON
The opening story, “A most
incredible meal,” tells of a

woodsman who discovers a
huge block of ice on his ,way

isa

home from work one evening.

After he has chipped most of
the ice away, he finds that
underneath the ice there stands
a frozen mastadon. He tells the
people of his discovery.

The local baron orders the
mastadon dismembered and cook-
ed for supper. All the local
dignitaries are invited and
everyone has a rollicking good
time gorging himself and get-

ting drunk. The woodsman
leaves the dinner because he
doesn't like the idea of the

locals eating his discovery and
finds his way into the taxider-
mist‘s shop. "

There the taxidermist is stuf-
fing the mastadons head. When
the woodsman asks him whats
up. he is informed that the
beast had flowers between its
teeth.

The rest of the stories are
equally as conventional.

Mr. Kotzwinkle is an excel-
lent story teller and has a clear
grasp of fantasy. The book is
an amusing, sometimes ironic
diversion, lacking any sort of
social pretense. He adequately
captures the tone of a fantastic
wood cutter, he describes na-
ture with a sort of raving eye
for detail and color, and he has
a sense of humor. In l970’s
fiction this is more than unique.

In McLaughlin‘s estimation.
there are a number of present

Candidates Rap DA

by JIM MAC

Four men seeking the Demo-
cratic nomination for Allegheny
County District Attorney last
week sharply criticized DA Rob-
ert Duggans failure to deal ef-
fectively with the County drug
problem.

Larry Gaitens. John Hickton.
Leonard Martino and John Bing-
ler, at a session here Wednesday.
also rapped Duggan for his “ov-
erall lack of significant purpose."

The candidates scored Duggan‘s
“Lack of foresight and adminis-
trative neglect“ in carrying out
his duties. They also ridiculed
what they considered-the DA's at-
tempt to force his “individual con-
science" on the community.

Martino, a criminal trial law-
yer, said that both the District
Attorney’s office and the County
Detectives’ office must change
their focus. “County detectives
should do less raiding and instead

aid the local municipalities which ,_

are less sophisticated,” he said.

Bingler, Pittsburgh Public
Safety director. asserted that
Duggan has  . . jumped on pub-
licity cases such as film censor-
ship and abortion while by-
passing more urgent issues such
as organized crime.

Bingler. a former assistant
U.S. attorney specializing in
problems on hard narcotics. drug
rehabilitation. and civil rights.
said that. to date. Duggan has
done comparatively little to ease
the drug problem.

“We all saw the problem com-
ing, but until a few years ago,
the County had no detoxification-
rehabilitation centers,” said Bing-l
ler.”

The candidates agreed that the
penalty for possession of mari-
juana and hashish should be re-
duced from a felony to a misde-
meanor. I

Martino has been endorsed by

the Democratic party. while

Students Design Personal,
Informal Drug Center

by IAN HEISS

He's young and shows potential, but
problems at home and tension in school
cut him off from people. He's into drugs-
he takes them indiscriminantly. . . If he
becomes alienated or depressed enough,
he could, die of an overdose or commit
suicide.

He's wary of medical and advising
centers which claim to offer support yet
categorize him as a patient, client, Or
something less than cr person.

Believing existing drug treat-
ing facilities inadequate. con-
cerned students in the Univer-
sity have formed a student-to-
student drug counseling center
on campus that will begin oper-
ating shortly.

Aptly titled “A Little Help
From Your Friends," the cen-
ter differs from traditional drug
programs in that it is designed
and will be manned by Pitt
undergraduates who will aid
drug users on a personal. in-
formal basis.

The designers of the center
see certain limitations in con-
ventional drug counseling. In-

A new course will be of-
fered Spring Session called
“CAS 26: The Dynamics of
Female ldentity." The course
will be conducted in seminar
style and will cover the fol-
lowing topics: cultural stereo-
types of women; effects of
being female; myths and re-
alities of the position of
women; societal images of
women, and the effects on
society of rigidly defined
sexual roles.

There are no prerequi-
sites for the course and all
undergraduates may register.
It will meet Mondays, Tues-
days, Thursdays, and Fridays
from 9:30 -10:50 a.m.

they feel, too often make blind
referals, without sufficient know-
ledge of the student in terms of
his problems or personality.

Institutional counseling ser-
vices. and medical centers in
their estimation tend to "turn

off" students. because they ap-
proach the student impersonally.
treating him exclusively in terms
of his drug usage, or his psyche.

Rather than "treating“ people.
or forcing them into playing the
role of patient. the center will
afford an opportunity for a
person to discuss his problem
with members of his own peer
group. -

Students running the center
go through a training period of
participation in a series of com-
bined role-playing and encount-
er seminars. Through these
seminars they gain a perspec-
tive which enables them to re-
late to other individuals in a
variety of ways.

This gives the center a very
special character. Charles Rad-
ler. center co-ordinator. said.
"There is not one center in this
country, to my knowledge. that
relates to the person; they all
tend to be problem-orientated.

What we do is give a person
a chance to discuss his prob-
lems with a friend. not a doctor,
not ‘the man.‘ We feel it is more

important to facilitate an indi-

viduals growth to the point
where he is capable of deciding
his own course of action, rather
than imposing a solution about
drugs or anything else."

Radler had earlier discussed
the Drug‘ Center with Superin-
tendent Merritt of the Campus

larger problem which involves
not only the Economics depart-
ment and the College of Arts
and Sciences, but also the Uni-
versity and all academic com-
munities as well. The problem
is a by-product of both the cur-
rent market situation in the aca-
demic world and the develop-
ment of academics (as a profes-
sion) within contemporary so-
cieties.

TOO DEGREE CONSCIOUS?

Today, there exists a tremen-
dous glut in the market for well-
trained college professors. The
result has been a sort of “turn-
over game," in which depart-
ments in a great many schools
have begun hiring young assist-
ant professors (who have just
completed or are completing
their doctorates) with no inten-

tion of renewing after their
first contract expires.
Consequently, these schools

have been able to successfully
avoid granting either raises or
tenure. Neither the Economics
department, specifically, nor
the University. generally. has
been guilty of this practice.
much to the credit of both.

Moreover, there has developed
a practice of terminating a num-
ber of assistant professors in
order to hire one big-name
professor. Again, the department
and the University have been
innocent of such practices.

A second and considerably more
important aspect of the problem
concerns the growth of the univer-
sity as an institution within socie-
ty. Population has increased, ur-
banization and stratification have
“resulted, and certification has be-
come exceedingly important. Aca-
demia has not been immune.

The degree, at all levels. has
been ascribed much too much im-
portance as an index of ability. In-
stitutions of higher learning are in
very great danger of becoming
certification stations rather than
academic environments condu-
cive to total human growth.

Thus. the real problem involves
not whether faculty and adminis-
trators are concerned about the
qua'lity of undergraduate educa-
tion or whether “power politics"
dictates termination or renewal
of non-tenured faculty but wheth-
er faculty and administrators are

in a position to effectively imple- .

ment their concern and whether

it IS naive to assume that fac-

“power politics” is a primary
mechanism in the decision-mak-

on any one individual, any one de-

quite unfair.

The respective situations of

Kneafsey and Adams within the

a localized example of a much
larger and very real problem. Has
the growth of the University bred

The issues raised make it quite ' ’

apparent that a re-examination of-‘

the current direction of Ameri-
can education is in order. Have we
as a society begun to sacrifice
quality for certification? All
growth has its price. One may
rightly ask how much is to be

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

It was a good day for a football game. The sun was out
and the temperature had reached the mid-40's by early
afternoon. A cool. stiff wind blew southward from end zone
to end zone. and the best thing about the afternoon was that

7' the Panthers cou1dn‘t lose.

I'm referring. of course. to the annual Blue—Gold spring

«practice game that took place Saturday afternoon up at the

stadium. It marked the first time that the classic was being

‘ . played while classes were still in session. According to crowd

size estimates (3.300) though. the fact that the game was mov-
ed up didn't draw any more fans out to watch the contest
than it has in the past. ‘ »

After watching a ragged first half that featured six fum-
bles and very little scoring you started to wonder if. possibly
the performance justified the turnout. Action picked up dur-
ing the last 30 minutes of football. and the final score of
Gold 33. Blue 18. had packed its share of excitement.

“Ragged and young,” commented Panther Coach Carl
DePasqua even before he was confronted with a question
after the game. “A little bit of stage fright. They didn’t~con-

’ A centrate on the football as much as they could have.”

"The polished effect you're not going to get at this point."
commented backfield coach Bimbo Cicconi. echoing DePas-
qua‘s sentiments. "They all had their individual flashes. The
important thing is that they're seeking improvement in them-
selves."

Youth is a problem confronting every coach who is re-
building after a large graduating class. With youth comes in-
experience and a general lack of exposure. Sophomores make
mistakes. and plenty of them.

“They were hitting real well,” commented DePasqua.
“The ball changeovers and fumbles took a lot away from the
game. We had a lot of sophomores in there and they were mak-

ing mistakes.”

Almost every section of the team is affected by the large

A turnover of personnel. The defense has gone from the conven-

tional 4-3 to a tighter 5-2. due to the Panthers‘ lack of line-
backing experience. The defensive backfield has only one re-

A turning starter in Reggie Frye and starting positions in the of-

fensive backfield are up for grabs.

“ Concerned about whether the arrangements set up during
the past three weeks will become standard in the fall DePas-
qua said, “We‘ll have to keep the alignment we have now.
We made the switch because of the personnel—we had to."

‘With the talent there, experience and exposure form the
crux of DePasqua's problem and will remain so until the

. Cats step out onto UCLA's field on September 11.

TD Passes Highlight
Gold 33-18 Victory

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

After a shaky start in the first
half. both the Blues and the

Golds regrouped their forces
and combined for six second
half touchdowns. The Gold

squad won 33-18 in Saturday's
intra-squad game.

Fumbles. interceptions. and
dropped passes plagued both
teams in the first half. as the
team took turns committing mis-
cues.

The lineup of both teams was
filled with freshmen and players
that had little previous playing
experience.

Panther Coach Carl DePasqua A

admitted that, “Some of them
had a little bit of stage fright
and they didn’t concentrate all
the time.”

In the second half. quarter-
backs John Hogan. Dave Hav-
ern, and Bob Medwid resorted
to passing after the defense had
consistently stopped the running
attack. '

Hogan connected for three
aerial TD‘s for the Gold. while
Havern accounted for one on
each squad. Medwid threw one
touchdown pass for the Blues.

After a scoreless first quarter,
Hogan flipped a short pass to
sophomore back Bill Englert
who eluded two defenders and
raced 43 yards for the Gold
squad.

Englert. ‘who played defense
for the Cubs in the fall. was
recently switched from the se-
condary to the offensive back-
field. Ironically. he led all rush-
ers in the game with 64 yards
in 14 carries.

"We realized that Bill runs
well and we decided that we
wanted him running forward
instead of backward.“ said
DePasqua with a smile after
the contest. 2

Right before halftime, Hav-
ern rifled a bullet pass to Grant
Abe who made a diving catch
for the Blues first score.

Medwid guided the Blues to
their second touchdown early in
the second ‘half, with Paul Felin-

Gindin.

Bob DiTommaso kicked extra
points for both sides. Unfortu-
nately, the stocky 5-6 sophomore
got only three chances to con-
vert as mos't of the snapbacks
were fumbled. He hit on all
three for the Golds.

Bradshaw Named To
Head Coach Position

Richard Bradshaw, who served as interim head coach of the swim-
ming team since Bill Grant resigned in mid-season, was officially
appointed the newmentor of the mermen.

For the past two seasons. he has served as the assistant to 'Grant..

   

Prior to coming to Pitt. Bradshaw racked up a remarkable 58-3 record
at Bethel Park High School.

During his three years at Bethel. Bradshaw coached four All-
Americans and five state champs.

After his appointment, Bradshaw commented, “I’m enthusiastic,
I have to be. I enjoy the work and have a lot of fun doing it. It’ll be
a challenge. '

Bradshaw realizes that the fu-
ture of the swimming squad will
hinge upon his ability to recruit
area stars. Presently. he has com-
mitments from at least eight , — ' 
swimmers. and f'our more are ’ '
considering enrolling in the fall.

‘'I‘m confident about the fu-
ture of swimming at Pitt.“ he
said. There's an honest effort
put forth by the administration
and we should see an improve-
ment in the swimming."

Bradshaw graduated from Ohio
State in 1965. While he was an
undergraduate "there, he assist-
ed with the coaching of the
Buckeye swim team for one
season.

Bradshaw will be able to count
on the‘majority of this season's
squad next year. Diver Dave

Wessel will be the only major
loss to the team which compiled
a 2-8 record this winter. .

Pre-Meet Wait Cramps
Meek’s Performance

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Lowell Meek finished 14th in free exercise
among a field of 48 at_ the National Collegiate
Gymnastic Championship held last weekend at
the University of Michigan. I

Stormy Eaton of New Mexico State won the
event.

Bobbles really hurt me in the compulsories.”
stated Meek.“I hopped forward on both my head
spring and hand spring during the complusory
routine.”

Meek scored 8.6 points compaired to Eaton’s
leading 9.4.

On the second day of competition Meek scor-
ed as ‘well as Eaton in the optional routine, 9.4,
but finished 14th missing the cut for Saturday's
finals. Only two people topped Meek’s optional
score.

“After the two-hour wait before performing I
knew I wouldn’t do well. My balance was shot
and all I could do was stretch for flexibility.
There wasn't any place to warm—up,” said Meek.

Meek further mentioned that some friends told
him that he seemed to lack confidence in him-
self during his performance of the compulsory
routine.

With all the misfortune Meek met during
the meet he was pleased that some former all-
time greats approached him concerning his per-
formance in the optionals.

“It’s a great feeling to have a lot of all-time

' last year’s

greats like Toby Towson, ‘68 and ‘69 NCAA floor _g

exercise champ, Art Shurlock, former U.S. Olym-

, pian and even Stormy Eaton come up to you and '

say ‘that was a good routine kid.”

Yoshi Hayasaki retained his all-around crown
despite the strong challenges from Marshall
Avener of Penn State and Brent Simmons of low
State. '

Penn State's Tom Dunn tied Brent Simmons for
the crown on the Parallel bars.

Simmons won the horizontal bar event to be
the only double winner of the meet.

Russ Hoffman, also from Iowa State was the
only other per-  ~ ~ .. .
former to repeat .'
his title on the
side horse.

 Mitter Season Set To

Open Today At WVUL 

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

_ Due to wetgrounds, the Friday Pitt-Duquesne baseball game at
Herschel Field, was cancelled, delaying the opening of Pitt‘s ‘7l

campaign.

. 'l‘h_e ‘season opener was instead played Monday against West
Virginia in a doubleheader at WVU’s Hawley Field at 1 p.m.

Pit”t’s coach Bobby Lewis will be going with the same line-up
planned for the Duquesne game with only a few possible changes.

Senior captain Bob Solonickne is

and may see action on Monday.

“Soll’s been feeling pretty
good lately,” stated Lewis. “If
he feels good on Monday, he’ll
play the outfield and Ken
Macha will move to first.”

Due to, the lack of outside
work, Lewis still intends to use
more than one pitcher in both
games of the doubleheader.

The Mountaineers have already
played 10 games, which in-
cludes a week long southern tour
to North and South Carolina.
Going into Monday‘s game,
Coach Dale Ramsburg’s team
will be posting a 8-2 record.

Ramsburg will start junior
righthander, John Raese at first

It doesn‘t seem likely that the Pitt track team is going to do things
differently now that the indoor track season is over. In the Kentucky
Relays last Saturday. the team took up right where they left off last

month and kept on winning.

Because of the late arrival of spring, the team's outside work has
been hampered. In spite of it though. Jim Banner was pleased with the

final results.

"I think the team did real well.“
he said. "we haven‘t been able to
do very much speed work."

The team proved successful in
the field events. Dan Kouvolo
made it two wins in a row with his
victory in the University Division
of the javelin throw at Kentucky.

Last week. Kouvolo won the
same event in the Florida Relays.
Kouvolo is hopeful that he can
maintain his early pace and be-
come one of the top throwers in
the country and thus "throw" his
way into the 1972 Olympics.

Jerry Richey doesn‘t know
whether or not he will attempt the
‘72 Olympics. In fact. he doesn't
even know whether or not he's on
the Pitt team because of an eli-
gibility decision now being con-
sidered by the ECAC (Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference).
However. Richey ran in the open
mile and six-mile eventsand won
them both.

As a freshman, Richey com-
peted in the IC4A’s and Nationals
for Pitt an that’s what the hassle
is about. Banner wouldn’t spec-
ulate on whether the decision will
come in Riche’s favor but a deci-
sion should be within eight days
or so.

Banner also experienced a cou-

ple _of pleasant surprises in the
Relays.

Bill Rea. a freshman. won the
University Division in the triple

jump with a jump of 49 feet 10

inches. Rea already holds the Pitt
record in the long jump and in his
first year seems well on his way
to eclipsing the 50 foot plateau in
the triple jump.

Up to now only his predeces-
sor, Bryant Salter, had achieved
this mark for Pitt as well as being
the only one to reach 50 feet in the
East. In his last triple jump for
Pitt in the Nationals, Salter had
a 50 foot two-inch effort.

Banner was also pleased that
Dave Szabat did so well in his
first attempt at the three-mile
run coming in ninth.

"The winning time in the
three-mile was 13:51." Banner
said. "In his first attempt Dave
Szabat had a 14:25. I think that‘s
pretty good.“

Banner indicated that a lot can
be expected of Szabat in the fu-

ture. Earlier in the indoor sea- ’

son, Banner said that Szabat had
all the tools to become one of the
premier long distance men in
the nation.

The sprint medley team fin-
ished second as did the two-
mile relay team to round out an-
other fine Pitt track perform-
ance. The distance medley team
didn't place because the baton
was accidentally knocked out of
Dorel Watley‘s hand by an er-
rant elbow.

Despite the fact that Carnegie-Mellon used three ringers. the Pitt
Ice Hockey Club closed out their initial season with a 7-6 victory over

the Tartans.

C-MU. which Pitt demolished earlier in the season. 8-1. sought to
avenge the humiliating loss by bolstering their squad with three Pitts-
burgh Amateur Hockey League skaters. The three (John Davies. Rich
Stein and Mike Mackin) were in on four of C-MUs six goals.

“I was rather upset by the whole thing but there was nothing I
could do." stated Joe Testa. the Pitt captain.

The Pitt icers also were hampered by injuries, as three regulars

missed the game. Out of action
were forwards Phil Gefsky and
Bill Mantis and high scoring (six
goals in five games) defenseman
GlennMHyde. Hyde ripped apart
C-MU in the last game as he scor-
ed two goals and three assists.

Bill Glenville wasted little time
in putting Pitt on the scoreboard
as he slapped the puck past C-
MU’s goalie Jeff Hart after only
20 seconds of play.

Less than two minutes later it
was 2-0 as Denny Browne scored
on an assist from Tom Lang. C-
MU got one back as Mackin scor-
ed the first of his two goals a few
minutes later. ~ '

However, goals by Pitt’s Dick
Solberg and Bill Glenville made it
4-lyas the first period came to a
close. The Pitt skaters went on to
score two more goals in the sec-
ond period before the big break-
down came.

After making it 6-1 on goals by
Denny Browne and Dick Solberg
the Pitt skaters eased up and al-
lowed C-MU to score two goals
to make it 6-3 before the second
period ended.

The Pitt skaters cameout in the

The Pitt Camaro will run three
times during the spring with the
first one April 18 at Summit Point.

May 16 at Cumberland and June 6

be the driver.

Fryer pointed out that Pitt stu-
dents interested in going to any of

ed admission to the race. Cards

third period set to hold on to their
lead but goals by Mackin and Dew-
ey cut the bulge to one goal.

 

With 8:30 left in the game and’
tempers on edge, Pitt’s Kerry

Browne checked Mackin heavily
into the boards. Mackin attacked
Browne and both were sent off
for five minutes. The departure of
Mackin seemed to be a break for
Pitt as C-MU was now without
its top scoring threat.

However. Mackins teammate
Stein tied it up with a breakway
at 5:57 of the third period.

The Tartan goal picked Pitt up

and only 38 seconds’ later Bill
Glenville put Pitt ahead to stay
with his third goal of the game.
Assisting Bill on the winning goal
were Dick Solberg (the teams
leading scorer) and Dave Bahn-
son.

The victory in their final game
left the Pitt icers with a 34-3-1
record.

"I consider it a successful sea-
son when you note that were only
a three month old club which got
to play only eight games.“ stated
Testa. He went on to point out
that both C-MU and St. Vincents.
which have had teams two years.
were both defeated by Pitt and
“neither of them despite their ex-
perience came close to the quality
we had.”

Pitt defeated C-MU twice by

scores of 8-1 and 7-6. while St..

Vincentswas victimized to the
tune of 7-3 by Pitts second string
team. ‘The other victory came
against the Johnstown Junior
Jets. a semi—pro team. whom Pitt
exploded against with a 13-goal
barrage.

Of the team’s three losses only.

one, an 8-2 loss to Gannon, was to
a college team. The other two de-
feats were to much more experi-
enced teams like the Pittsburgh
Knights and South Park. The lone
tie, a wild 6-6 deadlock, was
against Mike Mackin’s team —
North Park.
