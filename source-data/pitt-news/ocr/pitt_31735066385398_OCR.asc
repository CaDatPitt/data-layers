UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

SGB
discusses
aﬂeged
assault

By Stephanie Myers

Staff Writer

In a meeting last night, the
Student Government Board
discussed flyers that were cir-
culated around campus, warn-
9 ing of a rape that allegedly
occurred on Nov. 14 at 7 p.m.
in the Forbes Quadrangle.

The flyer, dated Nov. I6,
stated that, ’’Last Monday,
November I4, at seven in the
evening, a student was raped
and knocked unconscious on
the steps of Forbes Quad-
tangle.”

Pitt Director of Public Safe-
‘ ty Walt Waters said yesterday,
however, that the incident was
actually a case of alleged
”indecent assault.”

Richard Smethurst, dean of
the history department, was
. responsible for circulating
these flyers.

SGB President Craig Jackson
said that the board is not favor-
ing the flyers, but it believes
that some action should have
been taken to better inform the
students.

Jackson said, ”The fact of
the matter is something has
happened. This is the time of
the year when everybody is
studying late at night, and peo-
ple aren’t thinking about
safety.

"Students should be warned
that there are still dangerous
people out there that we need
to watch out for. S_tudents
should also be aware that just
because we have finals now,
the rest of the world [doesn't]
go away.” ‘

Jackson feels that just be-
cause the university seems
safe and has been safe doesn't
mean it's always going to be
that way. He said that the stu-
dent government, along with
the other student organiza-
tions, needs to work together
on making people aware that
such things can happen.

”We’re here to protect the
student body,” said Jackson.

Jackson also emphasized,
”Aiflyer has been handed out,
and there is some misinforma-
tion on it. Student government
isn't backing it.”

Pitt student victim of indecent assault

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Campus police have drawn

nothing so far in their investiga-
tion of the alleged indecent as-
sault of a part-time Pitt female
student Nov. 14 in Forbes Quad-
rangle.

According to Campus Director

of Public Safety Walt Waters, the
woman, whose name is being
withheld, was walking at 7:20
p.m. in the southeast stairwell be-
tween the first and garage—level
floors when the attack reported-

ly happened.

Waters said the woman could
not identify her attacker, other
than by the fact that he was a
white male wearing black
trousers. I

Waters said that after being
taken to Magee-Women’s Hospi-
tal in Oakland, she showed no
signs of physical abuse.

”The circumstances involved
are questionable,” Waters said.
”The incident is under investi-
gation.” *

According to Waters, the inci-
dent has been determined as an

indecent assualt because the
woman was allegedly fondled by
her aggressor, but intercourse did
not tak.e place.

Waters also said that he doesn't
want people to be panicked by
the alleged incident. ”We don't
have a mad rapist running
around,” he said. V

A flyer was distributed to the
history department faculty, staff
and graduate students by Richard
Smethurst, chairman of the histo-
ry department, to advise caution
when using Forbes Quad facili-
ties on weekends and in the

evening. ‘

Waters said, ”It’s a shame that
this incident had to happen”’be—
fore the flyer was distributed.

He added that using caution is
a ”good practice, not_only on
campus, but for people living off
campus as_well.

”The University of Pittsburgh
campus is safe. But there’s a
difference between safe and
crime-free.”

He said, ”[Forbes Quad] is as
safe now as it has ever been.”

Next year's Interfraternity

Council officers come from very
different types of fraternities.
However, there is no difference
in the issues they all feel the next
IFC administration will face. Im-
proving the Greek image, in-
creasing rush and improving
community relations are all
problems that the new IFC will
have to face. .

Jim Venturella. of Sigma Chi,

the 'IFC’s president-elect, said bad
publicity is the cause of an un-
favorable image of fraternities.

’’In the past, anything that gets in
the paper [is] the bad things the
Greeks have done.”

The new internal vice presi-
dent, Jerome O'Rourke of Delta
Tau Delta, agreed with Venturel—
la. ”When we do something
good,” he said, ”you’ll never see
it in The Pittsburgh Press or Post-
Gazette.”

Paul Uhlman of Phi Gamma
Delta said that even good public-
ity is difficult to get. 7’[When] any-
thing negative is brought up, you
need five times as much good
publicity to even it out.”

In addition, David Bennet of
Alpha Epsilon Pi, the new IFC

secretary, felt bad publicity
prompted a bad image of frater-
nities. ”An image can be scarred
by a movie such as Animal
House,” he said.

Next year's IFC—will also have
the task of improving communi-
ty relations. Uhlman said he feels
the fraternities help their neigh-
bors as much as possible.

”It’s not what [our neighbors]
can do for us, it's what we can do
for them,” he said. Uhlman not-
ed that FIJI is the oldest fraternity
at Pitt and has had an off-the-hill
house for 70 years. In addition,
he said, the fraternity gets permis-
sion from the neighbors before

throwing a party.

Venturella said more commu-
nity service projects will help im-
prove community relations. In
addition, Bennet added, the
fraternities will continue to raise
money for charity.

O'Rourke said improving com-
munity relations was important,
because he hopes that if neigh-
bors of fraternities have com-
plaints, they will call the fraternity

or the IFC president before ca|l- '

ing the police.

Shuttle launch hindered by techn

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— Despite threatening weather,
NASA pressed ahead toward to-
day's launching of Atlantis’ secret
satellite mission, but a new
problem cropped up — two
stripped bolts on the spaceship.

A reliable source reported that
the 21-man Mission Management
Team decided during an after-
noon meeting Wednesday to pro-
ceed with the countdown even
though weather officials were.
reporting that an advancing storm
reduced the odds of launch to
one in five. .

Another look would be made
at the weather before technicians
begin fueling the shuttle’s fuel
tanks late tonight. ‘

Meanwhile, the source, who
requested anonymity, reported
the_launch pad crew discovered

that two bolts had been stripped —

on an access panel leading to a
cluster of small engines used to
steer the shuttle in orbit.

He said the stripped bolts were
replaced by studs that were glued
down with a special epoxy. If the
glue does not hold, he said,'the
launch might have to be delayed
a day or two.

 

A leaking tire on the shuttle’s
main landing gear was a less
bothersome concern.

The management team met to
assess the worsening weather
forecast, which called for winds
up to 24 mph, heavy clouds and
the possibility of light rain at the
planned launch time. The
problem with the bolts surfaced
during this meeting.

FDIC plans changes

Two years ago, students, the
media and the government of the
Soviet Union met for the first time
to discuss the decline of the
country's educational system and
its effect on the Soviet economy.

The resulting educational pro-
grams now being implemented in
the Soviet Union were the topics
of a lecture held yesterday by Dr.
Vadim Korablev, the director of
a physics lab at the Leningrad
Polytechnic Institute.

”We have lost almost 50 per-
cent of our students each year be-
cause of grades,” said Korablev.

According to Korablev, nearly
every high school in the Soviet
Union has initiated programs
with neighboring universities to
provide excellent students with

”Our students also _have more

Korablev said that the Soviet

New base wage is

still just not enough

The national minimum wage has been ‘$3.35 since
1981, and the state legislature has come to the conclu-
sion that it is simply not high enough.

A bill which would raise the Pennsylvania minimum
wage 35 cents over the national minimum passed through
the House on Tuesday by a vote of 191-2. The bill had
already passed through the Senate.

The Democrats have been trying to raise the minimum
wage for over a year, up to $4.65 by 1991, but the Repub-
licans continually blocked it. The Republicans came up
with this bill that was passed as a compromise.

6 Pennsylvania is not the only state or province that has
a minimum wage higher than the national wage. Eleven
other states, the Virgin Islands and the District of Colum-
bia have higher minimum wages than the national one.

It is ridiculous that individual states should have to in—_
crease the minimum wage to keep it in line with the
poverty level. The 35-cent increase is not nearly enough.
In The Pittsburgh Press, Rep. Robert E. Belfanti said that
a family of three needs an increase of $1.20 an hour to

reach the poverty level.

The arguments that a higher minimum wage would
decrease the number ofjobs is suspect because business-
es have had seven years to increase their profit margin.
If some businesses are still paying their workers the same
amount they were paying them in 1981, then they are rip-
ping those people offand should be forced to pay them
more. If the business is paying its workers more, then the
new minimum wage will not affect it. Either way, an in-
crease in the national minimum wage should be a prime
concern for the next Congress so that people will be able

to earn a decent living.

The Kennedy legacy lives on

On a dazzling sunny Texas
morning, John F. Kennedy met
his public with his hands and his
heart. A nation cheered. Miles
away, an assassin waited. By af-
ternoon, a nation mourned. We
had much that day. We lost much
that day.

What is it that sets one man
apart from all others? America, on
Nov. 22, 1963, lost one of the
most intelligent and attractive of
its presidents. There is a strong
emotion for the Kennedy legacy
because his administration was a
quest for excellence. John Kenne-
dy was handsome; he was grace-
ful; he was courageous and he
was funny. Given a place to
stand, he had the ability to move
the~wor|d.

Kennedy was a new kind of
president, a man unlike other
men. He enveloped himself with
heroic images. With him as lead-
er, our nation would soar to a
new era of enlightenment, of
strength, of justice and peace. In
1961, the world didn't belong to
a few, but to all.

Although he ran a youthful ad-
ministration — the average age of
the Cabinet was 47 — Kennedy
balanced the young and the old
to carry the greatness of the New
Deal to the New Frontier. The
idea was to achieve liberal aims
by conventional means.

The years 1961 through 1963

were active and productive. John
Kennedy revived encouragement
and appreciation of the arts. No
other president invited as many
poets, artists and musicians to the
White House as Kennedy. He
could be tough, as he proved to
the Soviet premier. Kennedy
negotiated freely with Khrush-
chev, but he did not negotiate
freedom. The U.S. space program

JARRETT .
ALTDORFER

leaped forward. In 1962, John
Glenn became the first American’
astronaut to orbit the Earth.
Knowing that man had in his
hands the power to abolish all
forms of human life, Kennedy
signed a treaty banning most‘test-
ing of nuclear weapons. Then,
risking war for peace, the presi-
dent forced the Soviets to remove
missiles from Cuba by blockad-
ing the island. Kennedy initiated
the challenge for young people to
serve their country. What might
be the most enduring legacy of
his administration, the Peace
Corps, was established to chan-

’ nel the idealism and the skills of

young Americans to improve the
quality of life for people in disad-
vantaged nations.

On Nov. 22 of 1963, the world
wept. During the next three days,

America stood still to honor the
President. Over 200 world lead-
ers expressed their sorrow at
Arlington. In Berlin, 25,000
mourners prayed for the soul of
the fallen president in a torchlit
march. In London, Parliament ad-
journed, and the Pope prayed in
the Vatican. Jacqueline Kennedy
drew strength from the tragic in-
cident. She reacted with dignity,
restraint and pride.

John Kennedy believed that
idealism and high aspirations are
compatible with the most practi-
cal and efficient of programs. He
tried, sometimes unsuccessfully,

to solve ‘problems and take ac--

tions guided by moral aim and
values. To adhere to standards of
idealism and vision takes great
courage and self-confidence.

John F. Kennedy was not a
saint, for all men are a combina-
tion of good and bad. He never
asked to be a martyr. What he
asked was for Americans to be
greater than himself, not merely
to survive but to prevail.

Those who do not see Kenne-
dy’s spiritual light are blind.
Those who do not comprehend
his wisdom are ignorant. Those
who do not gain strength from his
courage are cowards. And those
who do not feel his loss have no
compassion.

He made the beginning, but

we have only just begun.

Let ”terrorist” YasirArafat into the United States?

You printed an editorial (Nov.
29) stating that PLO leader Yasir
Arafat should be granted a visa
into the United States. I don't
think you know who you're talk-
ing about. Are you talking about
the man who OK’d the murder of
the American cripple, Kling-
hoffer, from the Achille Lauro?
Are you speaking of the man who
said, ”We shall fight until the
sands of our deserts will swallow
the Israelis?’’ Or maybe you're
talking about the one who plants
bombs in Israeli childrens’ school
buses? God knows those 6- and
7-year-old children are responsi-
ble for the Arab-Israeli conflict,
right?

You seem to be taking this man
very lightly. You stated, ”There is
no denying the fact that Arafat
has terrorist connections.“ I
would say that anyone who holds

the position_gof_the PLO terzrorist ,
chairman has a little bit more to-«»

 

do with terrorism than just mere
”connections.” You also stated
that ”whether or not Arafat is a
terrorist and undeserving of
recognition is irrelevant.” I would
say it is very relevant. The Unit-
ed States has rules against deal-

LETTERS

ing, .even indirectly, with
terrorism.
Lastly, The Pitt News quoted
Paul Lewis of The New York
Times (a highly biased
newspaper against Israel) as say-
ing, ”The U.S. is viewed as claim-
ing the right to stop any foreign
dignitary from attending the ses-
sions of the United Nations if it
happens to disagree with that per-
son's policies or point of view 
.” To clarify some confusion, The
United Nations Headquarters
Agreement of 1947 does say that

the U.S. should not impose any
obstacles of transit to any
representatives of a U.N. member
nation. However, Arafat and the
PLO are not a member nation of
the U.N., so the.U.S. has every
right to impose obstacles and
deny passage for Arafat.

Before being quick to [pass]
judgment upon Schulz's decision
of visa denial, please re-evaluate
your moral codes and study the
facts.

Frowning on Morton Downey

In the Nov. 22 issue of The Pitt
News, an advertisement an-
nounced a campus appearance
by Morton Downey Jr. sponsored
by the Pitt Program Council. On
the very next page of that same
issue, the [unsigned editorial] ex-

tolled the Downey visit to our
campus. [It] claimed that the PPC
was ”acting in the tradition of en-
tertainment” and ”giving the peo-
ple what they want.” Which
causes us to raise the question:

Just who really wants this man to J

”speak” on our campus?

We, like many other Pitt stu-
dents, are outraged and disap-
pointed by the prospects of our
activity fees being used for a
speaker who, as the [unsigned
editorial] stated, ”has demonstrat-
ed his ability to transform an au-
dience into a street gang.” [...]

Even more disturbing than Mr.
Downey’s visit and the fact that
we are paying for it_ is The Pitt
News’ embracing of the visit and
[its] encouragement of this sensa-
tionalized behavior from both the
speaker and the audience. The
Nov. 22 article stated that ”each

Morton Downey Jr. Show offers 1

viewers 60 minutes of insults, sar-

casm, pointless screaming and
old-fashioned scapegoating.”
We, as students of an ”institution
of higher education,” should take
it upon ourselves to condemn this
kind of spectacle and not partici-
pate in it. Above all, we should
not encourage it on our own
campus. The PPC and The Pitt
News feel that it would be ”fun”
to participate in this denigrating
”fad” of inciting hatred,
prejudices and fear [in] large au-
diences. This is inexcusable.

We feel that Mr. Downey’s
speaking engagement would
have no creative or intellectual
value, and it would be an embar-
rassment to the name of the
university. [...]

Thursday, December I, 1988

The only thing more depressing than Christmas...

Last week, millions of Ameri-
cans sat down at their dining
room tables to celebrate Thanks-
giving. But what is Thanksgiving
except another one of those
pseudo—ho|idays that no one
would give a damn about if it
weren't for the fact that it gets
them out of their miserable jobs?

Seriously though, what is
Thanksgiving for? Supposedly we
are to trace this holiday back to
the Pilgrim era, when the reli-
gious fanatics /who were kicked
out of Europe celebrated a feast
day in the New World with
”savages,” the same ”savages”
who they systematically extermi-
nated soon after.

Usually, the first thing to pop
into people's minds when you
say "Thanksgiving" is ”turkey
dinner.” But seriously, how many
of us really enjoy eating turkey?
I mean, come on; I, for one,
usually pass up the processed

cafeteria turkey that looks more
like a beige place mat than
poultry. And hey, how many of

MARIO OLIVERIO

us eat turkey for dinner on the
other 364 days of the year? Not
many, I bet.

If turkey is really such fine cui-
sine then how come super-
markets can't give that damn bird
away come July?

Another fine Thanksgiving tra-
dition is the once-luxurious Ma-
cy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. I
used to love clicking on NBC and
watching the various gigantic
floats go sailing by — classy floats
like Rocky and Bullwinkle. Last
Thursday, I turned the channel
only to find every third—rate NBC
actor singing or dancing; the only
time I saw the actual parade is
when they were about to cut to

a commercial. My idea of a pa-
rade is not watching Emmanual
Lewis of Webster sing a rap duet
with Menudo.

And of course, what Thanksgiv-
ing evening would be complete
without the Detroit Lions game.

’ I'm not sure, but I can't remem-
ber the last time the Lions had an
interesting team, let alone one
that was in the running for the Su-
per’ Bowl. But it's tradition to
watch a lousy team on a lousy
holiday.

But the main emphasis on
Thanksgiving is, of course, the big
dinner with family and friends.
Just to be in vogue, my parents in-
vited our American Indian next-
door neighbors over to share din-
ner with us. But alas, Mr. and
Mrs. Blackfoot don't celebrate the
white man's holiday because it's
stupid and just gives federal em-
ployees an excuse not to work.

Dinner with your family is al-

ways the hallmark of Thanksgiv-
ing. On your right is your old
grandmother, who is in constant
danger of leaving her dentures on
that next bite of her corn on the
cob. To your left is your 3-year-
old niece, the one always
strapped to the high chair good
and tight but with her arms free
and flailing about, knocking over
this and that, constantly grabbing
food from your plate and whin-
ing, ”Mine! Mine!"

The only thing worse than din-
ner is the messy aftermath. Dish-
es are ubiquitous, everybody is
too full to move, and there's al-
ways that one aunt with the hair-
piece, usually named Gerty or
Madge, that says, ’’I think the
men should clean up for once,
don't you, girls?” She's the aunt
with no husband but with 10
cats.

But we all know what happens
the day after Thanksgiving — the

kickoff of the Christmas season,

shopping or othen/vise. The radio _

plays ”White Christmas,” sung
by everyone from The Captain
and Tenille to Anthrax. From now
until Dec. 25, Christmas shows
will dominate the television —
shows like A Martian Christmas
Carol, Perry Como’s Christmas in
Scranton, and, of course, Ru-
dolph has a Baby. J
Let's not even talk about the
shopping malls and how fanati-
cal people get over buying
presents. Just last weekend, this
other shopper and I had a knock-
down, drag—out, down-in-the-
mud fight over the last videocas-
sette of the do-it-yourself tape of
So You Want to Builda Balcony.
I would have won, if the old
broad hadn't blindsided me with

her cane. The only thing more

depressing is Christmas... ah...
but that's another column.

An instant of fame comes from a lifetime of planning

You see them on television,
holding their fingers in the air and
sticking their tongues out, and

you wonder where they come

from. They're the fans that the
cameras pan to between football
plays. They are the people who
make everything about TV sports
worthwhile.

"How do sports fans qualify for

a sound bite at the football
game?” I asked Bill Pearson,
whom you probably saw in the
final quarter of the Redskins-
Bears game. Aw,\come on, don't
say you've forgotten him. He was
the fellow in the Redskins knit
hat, who waved his arms up and
down and yelled, ”Hi, Mom!”
into the camera. Everyone was
talking about it the next day.

I accidentally ran into Bill on
the corner of 16th and K streets
in Washington, D.C., where he
was mobbed by autograph
seekers.

”You were fantastic,” I told
him. ”I thought that the fans were
going to go crazy when you
jumped onto your seat to declare
that the Redskins were No. 1."

Bill blushed modestly. ”Every—
one was great. You can't do a
good job on TV without the little
people behind you — the direc-
tors, the cameramen and the
scriptwriters, not to mention the
network vice presidents who had
the faith to put me on the.screen,
knowing I had a sore throat. I'd
also like to thank my grand-
mother Quayle, who told me

A many years ago, when I revealed

to her my dream of appearing on
TV, ’Youcan do anything you
want, if you just put your mind

I to it.’ ”

”You were lucky to have a
wise grandmother," I told him.
”But in the long run, you were
the one who did it. What gave
you the idea to declare that the
Redskins were No. 1?"

”I’d been thinking about doing
it for some time. In the game be-
fore the Bears, I had noticed that
the No. 3 camera was panning
closer and closer toward me. So
it dawned on me last week that
I had better be prepared, just in
case. I had several options, in-
cluding waving my Redskins ban-
ner or even my hot dog. But I
decided to fool them with the old
’we—are—number-one’ play. As
soon as the red light went on, I
was ready.”

”You certainly were. I never
saw a football fan who was so be-
lievable on television.”

’’In order for the cameraman to
get the full shot, I had to push
down Arnie Blauvelt who was in

the rowin front. He isn't talking
to me.”

”People are still talking about
that unforgettable moment when
you looked straight‘ into the
camera and yelled, ‘Hi, Mom, I'll
be home for dinner.’ That was in-
spired, and I don't think the view-
ers expected it.”

”My mom's been good to me,
and she deserved the recogni-
tion,” Bill said.’

"Not only did she deserve it,
but it was so real that everyone
had the feeling that she was put-
ting the roast beef in the oven.
Did she know that you would be
on?”

”There were no guarantees, but
I did tell her_to be sure and watch
the last quarter. There had been
a lot of talk that the director was
looking for new faces because the
home audiences were turning

_their sets off. I guess when I ap;

peared it was a bigger moment

for my mother than it was for me.
What's nice about it is that she
called everyone up in advance,
so the whole neighborhood saw

”Since you've been there, what

would be your advice for another '

fan who might wind up on the TV
screen?”

”Be yourself. No matter what
you do, give it your best shot,
whether it's yelling, making ugly
faces or sticking your tongue out
at the camera. Above all, don't let
them see you sweat — and mind
your manners. TV audiences
can't stand someone who makes

I a fool of himself. If they decide

they don't like you, they'll all get
up and go to the bathroom at the
very instant your big moment
comes.” ‘

TheRepublicans in position to convert black voters

Lee Atwater, soon—to—be chair-
_man of the Republican National
Committee, has announced that
he wants to convert blacks, who
mostly vote for Democrats, into
Republicans. The idea is a good

one. If fulfilled, it could make the '

Republican Party the majority
party it has longed to be and give
it control not only of the White
House, but also the House and

— Senate. But how best to achieve

this goal? Atwater did not say.
‘Here are some suggestions.

There is a growing sense
among the black poor that their
leaders have not delivered on
promises of a better life in ex-
change for their unfailing allegi-
ance to the Democratic Party.

Kimi Gray is one of the disen-
chanted. Gray is chairman of the
board of directors of the
Keni|worth—Parkside Resident
Management Corporation. Sim-
ply translated, she is the boss of
a large public housing project in
Washington, D.C., one that is
now a model for the nation.

In an almost unprecedented
display of cooperation, the liber-
al black Democrat, Rep. Walter
Fauntroy of the District of Colum-
bia, co-sponsored a bill with the
conservative white Republican,
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,

which allows Gray's public hous-
ing development to keep all its
financial reserves over and above
rent and plow the money back
into the community. Pride of
”ownership" is the result along
with a dedication to keeping the
place in good repair.

Gray delivers rapid-fire bullets
of condemnation for the status

CAL
THOMAS

quo and those black leaders who
have helped to perpetuate it:

”Poverty is profitable to every-
one except the poor.”

”The traditional way this coun-
try has assisted poor people is to
assist them to stay in poverty.”
[...]

”Welfare is another form of
slavery.”

"If given the opportunity to par-
ticipate in the economy of the
country, we'd be more indepen-
dent and not ask for handouts.
Our major spokesmen aren't
relaying that message.”

Gray said that if Republicans
really want the black vote, they
can start with improving housing
for the poor.

”Bush ought to begin by focus-

ing on housing,” she said. ”Rents
on public housing units need to

fall back to 25 percent of all gross
income. It's now at 30 percent.

, People must lie and say their chil-
dren aren’t working or that some-

one ,.isn't living with them,
otherwise they'll lose money.
Public housing is supposed to

be temporary. But how can any-

one save enough money to move

if the government takes 30 per-

cent of their gross income off the
top of every dollar earned?

Second, Gray said a training

program needs to be established
to help the poor start their own
businesses. She says many poor
blacks think of themselves only in
terms of working for others.
”Once we get into the main-
stream, there's no stopping us.”
As Charles Murray writes in his
book, In Pursuit of Happiness

and Good Government, ”One of

the great barriers to a discussion
of poverty and social policy in the
19805 is that so few people who
talk about poverty have ever
been poor.”

”Unti| recently, hardly any fa-
mily was more than one genera-
tion removed from poverty. But
today, asks Murray, ”how many
graduates of the Kennedy School
of Government or of the Harvard

Business School have ever been
really poor? How many have ever
had close friends who were?
How many even have parents
who were once poor? For those
who have never been poor and
have never even known any peo-
ple who were once poor, it is
difficult to treat poverty as some-
thing other than a mystery.”

_ Murray calls for a re—evaluation
of social policy which, he sug-
gests, ought not be aimed at mak-
ing people happy, but at
providing an economic threshold
that will enable them to pursue
happiness as they, not the
government, define the term.

It is possible for Republicans to
win political allegiance from the
poor, and particularly the black
poor, in exchange for economic
power, as the 1985 election of
Republican Gov. Tom Kean of
New Jersey demonstrated. Kean
won tvvo-thirds of the black vote.

In noting Kean’s success in at-
tracting black voters, The New
York Times editorialized, ”The
politics of inclusion do not re-
quire kowtowing or special pro-
grams, just paying attention to
where, within the accepted» rules
of the game, something can be
done to benefit a group that
needs it.”

The Republican Party has with-

in its ranks the business expertise
to enable the poor to make it on
their own. Does a drowning man
ever forget the one who pulled
him from the water or threw him
a lifeline? Would those poor who
have voted for Democrats all
their lives only to remain in
poverty ignore the Republicans
who threw them an economic
lifeline allowing them to escape
the undertow?

No economic enablement is
possible, though, unless there are
family ties within a functioning
community. Kimi Gray and her
public housing unit are succeed-
ing in building such an inter-
dependently functioning
community. This can help create
conditions conducive to the
restoration of stable families.

‘Giving the poor the encourage-
ment and the tools (not money
alone) for digging themselves out
of their rut, Mr. Atwater, is how
you win over the black vote. It is
also, Mr. Bush, how you build
that ”kinder, gentler nation” of
which you have eloquently
spoken.

"It will be nice,” Baldauf said,
"because there are no pressing or
controversial issues to be attend-
ed to right now. There will be
time to educate the board on the
allocations process.”

It is important for the new
board members to understand the
standing policies that they and
the Allocations Committee need
to follow when granting funds to
student organizations, he said.

According to Baldauf, ”keeping
all the channels open" between
the administration and the stu-
dent body is the SGB president's
primary job. Other board mem-
bers will be working on different
committees, each dealing with a
different aspect of student life at

Pitt, but, he explained, he is the
one to carry the board's proposals
before university administration.
"My job is to mediate," he

Baldauf said not having an op-
ponent run against him in
November's SOB elections ena-
bled him to better prepare for the
job he'll face in January.

Baldauf said he has recently
spent much time thinking about
what could be done to improve
the English language skills of
many of Pitt's foreign teaching as-
sistants. He proposes that T.A.s
go through more vigorous English
speech training before they are
permitted to teach students.

"I want to make sure that for-
eign T.A.s are ready to teach be-
fore they enter the classroom,” he
said. .

The pressure to be a good
president and to serve the stu-
dents well will come from his
own high expectations for him-
self, Baldauf said.

The Pittsburgh premiere of I'm Not
Rappaport opened last Wednesday
night at the Pittsburgh Public Theater,
delivering both humor and a message,
not to mention another jewel for th

PPT. “ '

As the play opens, we meet two re-
cently acquainted old men, Nat (David
S. Howard) and Midge (Samuel E.
Wright). Nat is a confrontational, re-
bellious, white fellow who hoards a
multitude of fictional characters under
his hat, releasing each richly created
identity as the situation deems
necessary.

On the other hand, Midge, a solitary
black man, wants to live out his days
hanging on to his anonymity and build-
ing super (ob — one he has had for over
40 years.

Through their repartee, which takes
place near a lake in Central Park on

December 1, I988

Anne Mundell's beautifully designed
set, we learn more about these men
and their plight — that of two older men
trying to maintain dignity and freedom
while facing the adversity of age and
the city's viciousness.

While Nat spins his yarns, anxious for
the friendship of a peer, Midge reluc-
tantly listens, only to be angered when
he realizes he _has once again been
taken in by Nat’s tall tales. Yet Midge
begrudgingly accepts Nat’s friendship.

After a conversation about cataracts,
Nat claims thathe and Midge are con-
nected: ”Who needs sight when we
have vision?” These men share both the
ills of old age and the wisdom of life's
experiences.

Throughout their dialogue, the
characters who threaten their peaceful
existence come and go.

One of them is Danforth (Will Os-
borne), the head of the tenants’ com-
mittee in Mid e’s building. it is his iob
to tell Midget at he is no longer need-

ed. Danforth, a communication arts
teacher, is trying to be friendly with his
bad news. Although painful, there is hu-
mor in this exchange. Midge, who
knows what's coming, says, ”You
teach talkin’. I guess you know we
about at the end of the chitchat section
now.”

Another character who interrupts the
men is Clara (Suzanne Grodner), Nat’s
daughter. Her concern is that her
father, who is always fighting for a
cause, will be hurt living alone in the
city.

Nat accuses her of giving up, asking
her what happened to the girl who
fought for ideals in the '60s. Clara ad-
mits she's the only person whose father
attended and coached her protests at
Columbia. While expressed different-
ly, both men fear the loss of their
freedom.

These are just a few small examples
of the humorous and thoughtfully writ-
ten text. Herb Gardner gives us a play

that provokes thought as well as laugh-
ter. His writing earned him a Tony
Award in i986, and one for Judd
Hirsch, who played Not in the Broad-
way production.

Through Maureen Heffernan's care-
ful and expert direction, the peripheral
actors in this production, including Dan-
forth; Clara; Laurie (Susan J. Coon), an
art student; Gilley (Michael Kelly
Boone), a street punk; and a cowboy
(John Hall), perform admirably, adding
texture to the story.

But high praise must be reserved for
the stars. Howard's Nat is fiesty, intel-
ligent and lovable, while Wright's
Midge is solemn, cool and wise. They
overcome life's obstacles with humor,
tenacity and courage. Their perfor-
mances demand that we listen and
learn. And learn we do.

To quote a line from the play, ”Old
people are the survivors. They haven't
stayed late just to ruin your party."

the turn of the century.

The Rosmer in Rosmersholm is

He is influenced by Rebecca
West (Rosemary Mizerak), the
governess of Rosmersholm. She
is the strong, liberated woman
who tries to help John break from
the traditional Rosmer mold".
”Men of God and Men of War”
was the symbol of the Rosmer
masculine ideal of perfection —
an ideal from which John tried
desperately to break.

John and Rebecca are lovers.
This fact creates the dichotomy
around which the play is cen-
tered. The feelings that they have
for one another (which they often
deny) keep them from having the
liberated type of friendship they
seek. The denial of each other
that makes this dichotomy possi-
ble prevents John and Rebecca
from the ultimate individual ful-
fillment their philosophies seek.

play. Dr. Kroll (Frank Schurter) at-
tempts to influence Rosmer to
take a more right—wing position.
Kroll cannot understand Rosmer’s
change of heart; nor can he ac-
cept similiar changes in the world
around him.

Similarly, Peter Mortensgard
(Martin Giles) tries to pull Rosmer
into a more radical stance. It
seems that the name Rosmer car-
ries so much influence that it au-
tomatically grants respectability
to any cause with which it is as-
sociated. This situation leads Ros-
mer to battle, as Ibsen puts it,
”the trolls within.”

The acting in Rosmersholm is
not as strong as in some of the
larger productions here in Oak-
land. Rebecca West is made dis-
tant to the audience. , Her
suffering is watched, not felt.
Philip Winters is occasionally un-
convincing as John Rosmer. Mar-

tin Giles, who also directed the
play, was, in contrast, superb in
the role of the manipulative
newspaper owner Peter Mor-
tensgard. _

This unevenness of acting pre-
vents_me from giving Rosmer-
sholm a rave review, but it Isn't
enough to completely |'€j€Cl the
play either. lbsen is a genius, and
this is often recognized as one of
his better plays. Rosmersholm Is
a good reason to take a break
from studying, and getting out of
Oakland for a while is rarely a
bad idea.

The New Group Theatre is a
small, comfortable theater that
seats about 40 people. All the
seats are good, and the advantage
of seeing a play In a smaller theat-
er is that you get to feel a part of
the production by being so near
to the action.

THE pm NEWS, Thursday, December 1, 1988

  

City Theatre is offering a satiri-
cal combination of WKRP in
Cinncinati and The Morton
Downey Jr. Show with its second
production of the season, Talk
Radio.

Talk Radio takes place in a
Cleveland radio station, WTLK,
that switched to an ”all talk
show” format to boost ratings.
One of WTLK’s shows, the Barry
Champlian show, Nighta/k, has
attained a large audience and is
about to ”go national.”

David Butler plays Barry, Talk
Radio’s lead role. Barry is the
host of a Morton Downey Jr. sort
of radio show. He belittles
callers, andthe listeners love it.

But Barry takes the show a lit-
tle more seriously than his au-
dience does. He's tired of callers
using his show to announce their
personal problems, express ig-
norant points of view and profess
their undying love for him. He
also resents his producer (played
by Bill Dalzell) and the show’s
advertisers trying to tell him how
to run Nightalk. A

To add to his problems, Barry
tends to take his frustration out on
his co—workers, Linda (Lori
Cardille) and Stu (Bill Mott), who
also happen to be his friends.

Barry and Linda occasionally
sleep together, but as Linda says,
”Barry is a nice place to visit, but
I wouldn't want to live there.”

ASHLEY
HAIGHT

Barry and Stu worked together
in their DJ days at a small station
in Akron. As a disc jockey, Barry
gained a following by encourag-

, ing listeners to call in just to talk,

Stu wasn't quite as successful,
and when Barry got a spot on
WTLK, Stu went with him to help
with the show.

Stu recalls the early years when
he and Barry would go out drink-

) ing after the show. But since that

time, the ever-frustrated Barry has
become distant and doesn't
bother much with Stu (or anyone
else).

Kent (played by Scott Small)
calls Nightalk, claiming that he
and his girlfriend were ”partying”
and she overdosed on one of the
numerous drugs the two of them
had taken that evening. Barry de-
cides that Kent is a practical jok-
er and hangs up on him, which
angers both the advertisers and
Sid, the show’s producer. (Kent
calls back...)

The character, Kent, was creat-
ed to typify the apathetic '80s
generation. He knows nothing
about the topics addressed on
Barry’s show and has no interest
in learning. But like the rest of
Barry’s audience, he listens any-
how to hear Barry ridicule the
callers that he doesn't hang up
on.

Talk Radio is an entertaining
and believable play and was well
cast, well directed and well per-
formed at City Theatre. The play
is being performed without an in-
termission and without a great
deal of movement onstage, but it
holds the attention of the au-
dience nonetheless.’

Butler's performance as Barry
was exceptional. He convincing-
ly portrayed the frustration that
his character felt without over-
dramatizing.

The acting of Cardille, Mott
and Small also deserves praise.
They developed their characters
adequately, though none of them
had very many lines.

Talk Radio was written by Eric
Bogosian and will run at City
Theatre through Dec. 11.

Other than Kent's costume
(which was a little outrageous),
Talk Radio is a realistic but in-
teresting play, and it is well worth
seeing. '

ce Schoolly

By Danita Anderson
I Staff Writer

‘  The ”Hip-Hop Rap Tour _’88”

2 is soon to arrive. Coming to Pitts-
burgh on Dec. 7 at Top Charlie's
in Monroeville are two of today's
hottest rappers. Featuring Ice-T
and Schoolly D,.a funky, sizzling
performance is guaranteed.

lce—T, deemed the most hard-
core rapper the West Coast has
ever heard, gets his message
across from first—hand experience.
The streets of L.A. were his
playgrounds, where he led a life
of crime as a young gangster. His
life is reflected in his music,
which states the facts and leaves
out the dramatics.

lce—T, however, has turned

 

D chillin’ at Top Charlie's

himself away from crime and has
become what many call the West
Coast M.C. King. Along with his

successful albums, Rhyme Pays, I

featuring the hit single, ’’Make it

Funky,” and his album that is top!

ping the charts, I’m Your Pusher,
l'ce—T starred in the movies
Breakin’ and Breakin’ /I and was
featured on the soundtrack of the
summer sizzler, Colors.

And then there is the master of
rap, Schoolly D. The 26—year-old
super—hot rapper is no newcomer
to the rap industry. As a young,
ambitious rapper, Schoolly D
recognized his talents, not only as
a performer, but as a producer as
well, early on.

His self-produced single
”P.S.K.” became a hit and paved

I the way for a deal with Jive/RCA   3

Records. Schoolly’s current al-
bum, Smoke Some Kill, is
”smokin’ ” the charts with the hit
single, ”Treacherous.”

Recently‘, Schoolly released a
video for his dynamic ”No More
Rock ’n’ Roll” hit, where School-
ly bares his muscular body as
well as his talents. Schoolly D is
definitely an ambitious, articulate
(not to mention sexy) young king
of rap with his head on straight
and a secure future. Look for his
new album coming out in the
spring. ,lt’s going to be a def con-
cert. Word!

SHOWCASE Soundings

 

Das Damen
Triskaidekaphobe
Marshmallow Conspiracy
SST Records

Although Das Damen has been
compared to Husker Du and Led
Zeppelin, their snake-like,
psychedelic interweaving of
distortion-washed, wahed—out
guitars and their dead-tight time
changes are uniquely their own.
New York City's Das Damen
delivers pure rock ’n’ roll un-
weighted by pretense or glam.

Das Damen’s second full-
length album, Triskaidekaphobe,
dispels any truth to the myth of
the sophomore slump. The al-
bum combines psychedelia
without being retro or obnoxious.
Side one kicks off with the in-
credible ”Spiderbirds." Its catchy
ascending riff locks ”Spiderbirds”
into a rolling groove that doesn't
get lost when it changes time for
the chorus.

THE PITT NEWS,

Most bands that use a wall of
distortion sound boring and
predictable, but Das Damen
manages to interlock their guitars
into a dance of harmonics and
melodic riffs that make almost ev-
ery song catchy even if their lyr-
ics are less than accessible.

”555” is another unbelievable
song that manages to conjure up
a swirling, sulfur—laden at-
mosphere before tearing into a
Zeppelin-like chorus.

Another cool song is the funky
”fIREJOKE.” Although one can
misinterpret the title as a fIRE-
HOSE put-down, the song title
actually came from the music it-
self. The Damens accurately felt
that the song sounded like a cross
between ‘old/good Killing Joke
and fIREHOSE.

A Triskaidekaphobe compan-
ion piece is EP Marshmallow
Conspiracy. It includes super-
distorted ”Bug” and a‘ remixed,
Fender-driven extended version
of ”555.” Other than appearing
on ghastly Pepto-Bismol-pink

colored vinyl it contains two
great non-LP songs. ”Sky Yen” is
an ultra-cool horn—laden rocker
that would have fit in perfectly on
Triskaidekaphobe.

The second new song called
”Song for Michael Jackson to
Sell,” is actually a distorted ver-
sion of The Beatles’ ”Magical
Mystery Tour.” Das Damen re-
mains relatively faithful in their
interpretation while adding an ex-
tended psychedelic jam at the
end.

With Triskaidekaphobe, Das
Damen has put itself in a precar-
ious position of having to deliver
an incredible third album. If ”Sky
Yen” is the direction Das Damen
will head on theirthird album, it
just might even excel beyond
Triskaidekaphobe.

Caterwaul
Beholden
I.R.S.

Ever since Ian Copeland let his
big money makers, REM and Be-
linda Carlisle, run off to other
record companies (in Belinda’s
case, he forgot her contract was
up for renewal), one has to seri--
ously question whether or not
|.R.S. Records is just a tax dodge
to hide some of the mega-bucks
Copeland’s made from managing
his brother Stewart and the
Police.

The final assurance of his lack
of monetary need came with his
abysmal Primitive Man Record-
ing Company and No Speak
record series, both subsidiaries of
l.R.S. '

I.R.S.’s roster of artists is look-
ing pretty meager these days as
well. Other than the Alarm and
the Bangles, there’s no one of
financial merit. Could it be Ian is
trying to be arty, like Homestead
or SST? Maybe not to the extreme
of either, but with artists like Tom
Verlaine and Let's Active, who
have real talent, l.R.S. does seem
to be heading away from the
mainstream.

A new up-and-coming talent
on I.R.S. is Caterwaul. This band
is a bizarre mix of lead singer Bet-
sy Martin’s Celtic/Arabic wail and
guitarist Mark Schafer’s murky
slidework. One is hard pressed to
locate their country of origin from
their sound. I still haven't a clue.

What should sound boring
comes off as almost irresistable.
“Nevertheless,” the first song on
their debut EP Beholden, is a
muddy piece of sonic landscape
that reflects that twilight-hour
feeling better than most bands
who've tried.

Schafer’s- delayed slide guitar
helps broaden the watery feel of
the song. Martin's vocals,
reminiscent of Irish folk chanting,
create an other-world feeling in
the song. ”Nevertheless” sounds
quite close to better A.R. Kane
and the intro to “In the Evening”
by Led Zeppelin, hybridized.

The real Zep influence appears
in ”Lay Down to Rest,” where
Betsy Martin's featured mandolin
and quirky singing brings ”The
Battle of Evermore” to mind. A
strange, sampled vocal effect,
running an Arabic scale, brings
an even more ethereal at-
mosphere to the song.

The song, ”Behold the
Night/On the Front Porch,” is
even more akin to Zeppelin ex-
periments. Made up of two songs
connected by the ticking of a
watch,‘ ”Beho|d” is similar to
”Nevertheless” in feeling and
mood.

As a debut EP, Caterwaul’s Be-

holden works quite well.

Although the music is a bit
homogenous, it is more than just
idle listening. I don't know how
Catervvaul will sound on their
next release, but Beholden is a
more than worthwhile stab at art,
it's actually good.

Voice of the Beehive
Let it Bee
Polygram

The B-52's vs. The Bangles vs.
Madness  This is not a movie
but the debut release from Voice
of the Beehive’s, Let it Bee.

Ex—Californian sisters Tracey_
Byrn and Melissa Brooke team up
with ex-Madness drummer, Woo-
dy. Mike Jones is on guitar, and
Martin Brent is‘ on bass. This
makes for an interesting potpourri
of progressive and pop music.

Their song, ’’I Say Nothing,”
has been big on the Top 40
charts, and the video has had
some heavy airtime on the old
standby, MTV.

Their sound can't really be clas-
sified as ”new,” but their arrange-
ments are inventive, the
drumming intense and the lyrics
are creative. Their look is like the
bouffant girls meet the Rastas.

Dreams So Real
Rough Night In Jericho‘
Arista

Rough Night In Jericho, the
debut disc from the trio Dreams
So Real, proves that there's some-
thing in the water down there in
Athens, Ga. Rough Night is an
excellent blend of vocal harmo-
nies, a touch of muscle and a lot
of finesse.

Formed in 1984, Dreams is
tight and polished from years on
the hometown circuit, and a
breakthrough gig at CBGB’s in

1987. Drew Worsham drums up
a storm while Trent Allen (bass)
and Barry Marler (guitars) com-
bine for some crisp harmonies.

To be sure, Dreams So Real is
neither R.E.M. nor the Squalls,
but a group that has distinctive
melodic energy and hip lyrics. It's
a complete album.

There's a lesson for this town
to learn from Athens. Encourage
original bands and music, and the
scene will thrive.

-— Mark O'Connor

Sons of Freedom
Sons of Freedom
Slash

It's fitting that Vancouver’s
Sons of Freedom are on Slash
Records because they're as sub-
tle as an electrical storm. This

‘I3

progressive guitar quartet grinds
out 10 originals with a seductive,
brooding drive that oozes the en-
tire disc, but is never overblown.

Sons are fronted by Jim -New-
ton (lead vocals and guitar) with
Don Harrison (guitar). Don Binns
is prominent on bass, and Don
Short supplies the backbeat with
a vengeance. J

For a band that's only been
together for two years, the Sons
have written and composed some
stand—up cuts like ’’Is It Love,”
’’Life is Tao,” ”Dead Dog on the
Highway” and the tribal ”Super
Cool Wagon.”

Sons of Freedom rock on the
progressive side of the fence, so
techno—poppers best keep away.
Let freedom reign.

I’ THE PITT NEWS

Back on Track  

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team (2-1)

.was able to rebound from the

crushing’ loss to Siena last Mon-
day by outpowering cross-town
rival Robert Morris (2-1), 75-62,
last night at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

’’I thought the kids hustled pret-
ty well,” Pitt coach Paul Evans
said. ”To win a game by 13
points and shoot 39 percent,
which is horendous, you have to
be pretty pleased to come out
with a win like that.”

”We needed something to put
a scare in us and that's what the
Siena game did,” Pitt guard Sean
Miller said. ”When it came down‘
to the end tonight, I think every-
body had in their mind to just
blow this thing out of here or we
are going to lose. We got our fast
break moving tonight and were
able to beat a very good team.”

The story of the game was Pitt's
near total domination on the
boards. The Panthers out-
rebounded the Colonials 46-27,
pulling down 18 offensive
’bounds.

”They just beat the heck out of
us inside,” Robert Morris coach
Jarrett’ Durham said. ”They just
pushed us around a little bit. in
the beginning, they were missing -
the outside shots, but getting the

1 rebound. It's not a good sign

when they can shoot and miss,
then get easy second shots.”
Pitt won the opening tap and
started out the game the right
way. Miller put the ball inside to
Bobby Martin, who paced Pitt

\with 22 points. Martin was

promplty fouled by Tyrone Steals.
Martin sunk one shot and Pitt was
up.

A minute later, Pitt ran the
same play and Martin was fouled
again, this time by Dave Thomas.
He hit only one again, but Pitt

looked to be onthe move.

’’It was good to‘ see the kids
come out strong,” Evans said.
”They knew that Robert Morris is
a good team this year. We had to
score early.” , _ _

The Pitt Panthers will square off
against the Syracuse Orangemen
this Saturday in the Carrier Dome
in what is a meaningful game for
both teams, even though it is the
end of the 1988 college football
regular season for them both.

, Pitt (6-4) lost 14-3 to a Peach
Bowl-bound North Carolina State
club two weeks ago. The team
was a little down that Saturday af-
ternoon because they had found
out earlier in the week that no
matter what happened in that
game, there would be no postsea-
son play.

Well, there has been an off-
week in between, and the team
should be a little more up for the

up 15-4 lead with less than seven
minutes gone in the half.

The Colonials called a time—out
and that's when they started to
come back. They ran their offense
to outside threat Scott Shepherd,
who promplty hit a three pointer
to put Robert Morris back in the

 

game.

The game went back and forth
for awhile as the Colonials cut to
within eight points at 30-22.

Pitt had to do something fast,
so they started putting the ball in-
side, where Martin was fouled
again. He missed on a one-and-

one the first time, but made both
on a second foul. Jason Matthews
promptly hit a three-pointer and
Pitt was up 35-22.

”lt was good to come out with
a win, but we still made a lot of
mistakes,” Martin said. ”We get
a big lead on people and we

Guard Sean Miller took advantage of a Robert Morris man-to-man defense, scoring 11 points.

Final game not meaningless for Panthers

Syracuse (8-2) game, to be aired
by ESPN at 4:30 p.m.

Pitt has something to prove this
week. They want to show that not
only are they a team that is
deserving of a bowl game, but
that they can play with some of
the best teams in the country.

”To tell the truth, at this point
in the year, I don't know how
much of an effect the off—week
will have on the team,” Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried said. ”We
did need sometime. People talk
about motivation. As I talked to
the team before NC. State, I said,
’You can't build crutches. You've
got to win the ball game. You
have to find ways to win.’

”lt’s the same way this week.
We'll approach it very positive-
ly. The players have wiorkedghard

and improved. They just have to

go out and do the same thing this
week."

The Pitt offense sputtered
against the Wolfpack, but they
still have some good numbers on
the stat sheet. Quarterback Dar-
nell Dickerson has completed
nearly 50 percent of his passes for
1,437 yards. He is also the sec-
ond leading rusher on the team
with 498 ground yards.

The leading Panther runner is,

of course, freshman phenom Cur- V

vin Richards with 1,156 yards.
The leading defender is senior
middle linebackerjerry Olsavsky
(just named to the Kodak All-
American Team) with a whop-
ping 120 tackles to his credit.
Syracuse coach Dick MacPher-
son,,,is_%,,i_rn&p)ressed with‘ the 

team.

’’I really think that this Pitt team
is going to be a powerhouse,”
MacPherson said. ”Last year, I
said that West Virginia would be
the team to beat this season. Pitt
is just like that. I think that they
are the eastern power of 1989.”

Not that Pitt is a slouch this
year, understand.

’’I think Curvin Richards is the
type of player that everyone looks
for. It is unbelievable the perfor-
mance he has had. Darnell Dick-
erson is a very tough quarterback.
Jerry ‘O’ is an inspiration to all of
us when we watch him play. We
love the way he plays the game,”
MacPherson said.

The Orange wants to use this
game as a momentum builder for

don't know how to put them
away yet. That comes from our
stamina and lack of concentra-
tion. lf we don't do it pretty soon,
something bad is going to
happenf’

Just like Siena, Robert Morris
did not stay down for long. They
ran off a series of eight straight
points and were only down by
six, 41-35, with 2:11 left.

With 27 seconds left, Miller
made his first trey of the game
and Colonial forward Vaughn
Luten followed with a layup at
the buzzer to make the halftime
score 44-39. ‘

”The defense was lacksadasical
in the first half,” Evans said. ”We
didn't cover the post very well.”

The star of the first h_alf for the
Panthers was Matthews. He hit
four of eight three-pointers and
finished the half with 18 points.
Luten led the Colonials with 14.

”lason, for a half, was unstop-
pable,” Evans said. '

Matthews did not score in the
second half.

”I thought we played well in
the first half,” Luten said. ”We
came back strong, but were killed
by the inside game.”

The second half was just like
the first half. The teams traded
baskets. The biggest difference
was that the Colonials went to a
man defense and successfully
shut down Matthews.

”His eyes get real wide when
he sees a zone,” Durham said.
”We knew at the half that we had
to change our defense to take
Matthews out of the game.”

When the Colonials succeed-
ed, Rod Brookin and Miller start-
ed to take over over the outside
shooting. Meanwhile, Martin and
Brian Shorter were on a mission
inside. ..

Yet, Robert Morris played right
with them until the 16 minute
mark, when Pitt went up by
eleven and never looked back the
rest of thelway. .

‘'1 think that this is one of the
best teams that Robert Morris has‘
ever had,” Evans said. ’’I don't
think that even Jerome Lane
would call them rinky-dink this
year.” 2

Peach Bowl.

Last season, Syracuse was con-
sidered one of the best teams in
the nation. They had Don
McPherson, the runner-up in
Heisman voting, at quarterback
and finished the season 11-0-1
(the blemish a 16-16 Sugar Bowl
tie against Auburn).

’’I don't think Syracuse has lost
much from last year," Gottfried
said. ”They are just as fine a team
as they were a year ago. They are
very solid and could cause us
trouble.”

A surprise for the Orangemen
this season has been quarterback
Todd Philcox. Redshirted his
freshman year, Philcox is now a

graduate student and has thrown

for 1,886 yards. He as filled in

Against Lang's wishes. METROPOUS was severely edited for its initial
American release, which left the story disjointed and difficult to follow,
and caused the loss of many scenes. some of which have disappeared
forever. The film is now restored as closely to its original conception as
possible. containing several scenes that do not exist in any other prints.
With music by such stars as Pat Benatar. Jon Anderson. Adam Ant and

working
harder
after loss

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

Nobody defines the old saying
”a man of few words” better than
defending national wrestling
champion Pat Santoro.

Santoro, a senior this season,
won his title in the I42-pound
weight class last year. However,
he is hesitant about acknowledg-
ing the term ”defending national
champion.”

’fThe way I look at it, no one
is the national champ this year.
So it's like a clean slate, and

everyone has to chase it,” San-

toro said. ”I’m not really defend-
ing anything, at least that's how
I try and look at it.”

Santoro was upset at the Ohio
Open (Nov. 19-20) by long-time
rival Mike Cole from Clarion
University. The two wrestlers
have an ongoing feud, according
to Coach Rande Stottlemyer.

Santoro said of his preseason
loss, ’’It eased a little bit of the
pressure, and it's certainly going
to make me work harder.

”When I looked at the films, it
seemed like I was really tense. I
think I was wrestling more not to
lose rather than to win,” Santoro
said. ”I can't afford to do that; I
just hope that I can wrestle bet-
ter each week.” .

Stottlemyer has great faith in

Santoro, stating that he's going to ‘

have his work cut out for him this
season in order to stay on top.

”Without a doubt, Pat is will-
ing to pay his dues to do what it
takes in order to stay on top,”
Stottlemyer said.

Santoro feels that Pitt has an ex-
cellent team this season, sparked
by the returning veterans as well
as the promising rookies.

Several wrestlers are out with
injuries, most notably Jeff Turn-
er, which could handicap the
Panthers in their preseason tour-
naments.

Santoro said, ”You can really
sense it in practice when Jeff is
not in the room. Some of the guys
are not as intense as they would
be if he were there. We miss his
intensity both physically and
mentally.”

Santoro is an extremely
reserved, quiet, polite individual,
and when meeting him for the
first time, it is hard to believe that
this person was a national
wrestling champion.

Santoro translates his seeming-
ly passive nature into precision
wrestling on the mat. He is a
quiet leader.

”I don't like to verbally express
myself. I just go out there and try
to get the job done and lead by
example ifl can. I think it's easy
to say one thing and do another,”
Santoro said. 5

The EWL, one of the most
respected and competitive
wrestling leagues in the nation,
poses a continual challenge to
the Panthers, which Santoro feels
the team will be able to live up
to.

”I think we're capable, proba-
bly in the top three teams in the
conference. I'd like to come away
with an EWL title," Santoro said.

‘Please see Pitt, page 17

”I think the team's a good mix of
young guys and veterans, and we
should do pretty well.”

West Point heavyweight trans-
fer Joe Conlon is impressed with
the Pitt wrestling program. ”I'm
proud to be a part of this pro-
gram. The people here are all
nice, and the coaches are ex-
cellent.’’

Conlon feels the Pitt wrestling

program, discipline-wise, is giv-
ing West Point a run for its
money.
, ”Believe it or not, everybody
on this team follows suit. When
the coach says to run at 6 a.m.,
everybody shows up. We lift
from 1 to 2:30 p.m. and then we
practice from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Pat Santoro sometimes wrestles
10 times in one day, and it takes
a lot of discipline to do that,”
Conlon said.

”I was impressed coming from

 

a very disciplined school to here,
where the wrestling is very dis-
ciplined. The coaches are great;
you've got to follow their rules.”

Conlon feels that Pitt will fare
extremely well in the EWL this
season, due to the youth and tal-
ent prevalent on this year's team.

The Panthers are on their way

to Las Vegas today to take part in .

”Todd has really filled the bill

The Orange again runs the op-
tion offense and have had good
success with it. Through their 10
games, the offense has run up
3,907 total offensive yards and a
average of 29.5 points a game.

Gottfried said. ”That concerns

Vasvary said.

Vasvary said there are no

they have to sit down with the

getting a great feeling from those
guys.” _

Vasvary acknowledges the fact
that he works his athletes hard.
' ”If it was easy, anybody could
do it, and it wouldn't mean
much.”

Most of his athletes run six or

-seven days a week, with middle

distance runners getting up at
6:30 nearly every morning to run.

”lt’s something you really got-
ta like to do,” Vasvary said. ”I’m
sure there are certain times they'd
rather be out partying on a Sun-
day afternoon instead of running

through Shadyside. But the peo-
ple who are out partying are not
running in the Penn Relays in
front of 50,000 people.”

Vasvary is entering his seventh
year at Pitt as head coach. He
came to Pitt from the University
of Virginia where he was an as-
sistant in men's and women's
track and head coach of men's
and women's cross country. He
is expecting tough competition
this year fromVBig East rivals Vil-
lanova and Georgetown (last
year's Big East champion).

The Panthers will get their first
test on Saturday, Dec. 3, when
they open the season with an
