The 40-foot “Rubber Duck”ﬂoating
in downtown Pittsburgh has made
itssplash in more than just the Al-
legheny River. Since its arrival last
month, it seems asthough everyone
wantsaslice ofthe pie, or inthis case,
a slice of the duck.

Duck mania has befallen the city“ So
of Pittsburgh, spurring many local

restaurants and businesses into ac-
tion since the yellow guest’s arrival
on Sept. 27. A number ofbusinesses
are offering promotions and selling
merchandise that spin off the now-
distinctive, 40—foot—high icon.
Florentijn Hofman, a Dutch art-
ist, created the inﬂatable rubber duck
as a work of contemporary. art. The
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust brought
the duck to the Steel City, marking
its ﬁrst trip to North America since
its birth in 2007, in celebration of
the Festival of Firsts. The festival is

City officials, labor leaders- and former UPMC
employees gathered for a press conference

4 on Tuesday morning demanding that UPMC
raise workers’ wages and stop harassing em-
ployees who want to unionize.

The press conference, which took place at _

9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the City—County Build-
ing, comes in the wake of a National Labor
Relations Board complaint released lastweek.
The NLRB complaint consolidates more than
45 charges that the Service Employees Inter-
national Union ﬁled against UPMC, including

- charges that UPMC employees threatened

and interrogated workers who supported
unionization and charges that UPMC ﬁred
"four employees who were engaged in union
activity. .

City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak or-
ganized the conference, which featured
speeches by Ron Oakes and Jim Staus, two
UPMC workers who have become the face of
the workers’ protest against the health care
giant. According to the NLRB complaint, Staus
and Oakes were allegedly ﬁred for supporting
unionization.

Additionally, Councilman Bruce Kraus,
Allegheny Labor Council Presidentjack Shea
and others spoke out against UPMC. Members
of United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based
union, aswe1lasUnited Food and Commercial
Workers, Unite Here and some international
unions, showed support by wearing T—shirts.

“UPMC is continuing to coerce, continuing

to intimidate, continuing to ﬁre its employees
justfor supportingunionization,”Rudiak said.

She said that the new NLRB complaint
comes just days after UPMC entered into a
settlement regarding the previous wave of
allegations, which proves that UPMC isn’t
making a real change in policy.

Protesters gathered in Oakland in September to protest

The original settlement dealt with a
complaint alleging that UPMC had illegally
quashed union—organizing efforts at its hos-
pitals in both Shadyside and Oakland. UPMC
ofﬁcials declined to comment.

According to Erika Fricke, a spokes-
woman for Frankel, federally certiﬁed
counselors will be on hand to help in-
dividuals who have trouble registering
on the Health Insurance Marketplace.

The Consumer Health Coalition, a lo-

cal nonproﬁt advocacy group, will send ‘

two certified applicationﬂcpunselors to
the session on Friday. Leslie Bachurski,
director of consumer navigation and
organizational development for the
coalition, said that the organization
received a federal grant to educate area
residents on the Affordable Care Act.

F The Allegheny Intermediate Unit,
a branch of Pittsburgh’s public school

system, will also send a representative
to take part in the session at the library.
Sarah McCluan, a spokeswoman for the
intermediate unit, said that it has also
received money to hire employees who
canahelp members of the public make‘
informed decisions.

Fricke said that Frankel’s office plans
to hold another information session on

the Affordable Care Act on Oct. 22 from

10 to 11 a.m. She said that Frankel’s
office will continue to hold these ses-
sions in November and December, but

i it is too early to make deﬁnite plans, for

those months.

“Rep. Frankel islincredibly passion-
ate about this issue,” Fricke said. “So
he wants to make sure that his ofﬁce
is responding to what the community
needs.”I

A disagreement occurred between Wos

p Shaunda Miles, a spokeswoman for the
Trust, said that the Trust and Wos reached
a compromise concerning the T-shirt sales.
According to Miles, the Pittsburgh Cultural

proceeds from the T-shirts will go directly to
the Toonseum. ' ’

“Both organizations share a common '

Winter Olympic Games marred bar

Russia’s human-“rights track recor

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

The Russian government struck yet
another blow against freedom of ex-
pression last week when it charged
Greenpeace activists with piracy
because of their peaceﬁil protest at
a state—owned oil rig.

Yes, piracy: “the practice of at-
tacking and robbing ships,” accord-
ing to the New Oxford Dictionary.
It seems that Russia cannot distin-
guishbetween apeaceful protest and
piracy, in light of their paranoia-ﬁr
eled war on liberty. During the “at—
tack” orchestrated by Greenpeace,
so labeled by the Russian federal
Investigative Committee, activists
approached the oil rig in a rubber
dinghy. Two of the activists proceed-
ed to tie themselves to aplatform off
the rig in an effort to draw attention
to Russia’s recent expansion of oil
and gas exploration in the Arctic
Circle. Without hesitation, Russian
commandos ascendedfrom helicop-
ter onto the scene and immediately
surrounded the unarmed activists,

who were then promptly taken into
custody.

Currently, there are 30 mem-
bers of Greenpeace from 18 «differ-

. ent countries detained and facing

charges of piracy in Russia. Each
activist is potentially facing up to
15 years in a Russian prison. With

' the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi,

Russia, only months away, it is iron-
ic that the soon-to—be host of the
games will not only provide accom-
modations for athletes fromvarious
countries, but now for a plethora of
diverse prisoners, as well.

Despite this apparent mistrust of

' foreigners, Russia still seems to be

genuinely excited to host the Winter
Olympics and to boost its interna-
tional image through some friendly
competition. So excited, in fact, that
the government razed the homes of
at least 1,500 Russian families to
make room for the festivities.
The global community, however;

should not be as eager to condone '

these kinds of actions through their
participation in the games. And by

' actions, I am not referring only to

the unbalanced charges against
Greenpeace activists or the demo-
lition of homes in which many Rus-
sian families have lived for decades.
Instead, I am referring to the fairly
extensive list of attacks against hu-
man rights the*Russian government
has committed over the last couple
of years.

Note: I am not defending the
hurnan—rights' records of former
Olympic hosts, such as China or even
the U.S. I am, however, defending
what I believe the Olympics stand
for: egalitarianism. The Olympics is
an event in which one is judged only
for his athletic prowess because, in
theory, the games are an event in
which prejudices are left behind
and skill is the only thing that re-
ally matters.

Yet the Russian government
happens to make a sport out of in-
tolerance: Their main targets being
political dissidents of the regime’s

policies — such as the aforementioned activ-
ists —— and members of the LGBT community.

Due to anextremely ambiguous law signed
by Presidentvladimir Putinbanningthe “pro-
paganda of nontraditional sexual relations
to minors,” sporting a rainbow ﬂag, meeting
with gay-rights groups or even using the word
“gay” in the wrong context could allbe means
for receiving aﬁne or even jail time in Russia.
All the while, the Russian government passed
this law under the guise of protecting Russian
society. They ruled that gays stir up not only
“social and religious hatred,” but are also a
threat to themselves and should therefore be
“protected” by the law.

Coincidentally, this law came into being
during a time of corruption accusations and
protests‘. It seems as if the Russians are using
the LGBT community as a scapegoat for the
government’s past misdeeds. So as long as
they’re infringing upon the rights of homo“-
sexuals, maybe the world will pay less atten-
tion to their oppression elsewhere.

This brings up an important question:
What about the gay athletes participating in

the Olympics this winter? Technically, the
International Olympic Committee prohib-
its athletes from expressing political views.
However, Johnny Weir, the openly gay U.S.
ﬁgure skater, stated why he will not boycott
the games on BBC’s Today in an August in-
terview: “It’s not Russia’s public’s fault that
their government is so bigoted and creating so
many problems for a minority group.” Others
were not as passive about the whole issue. For
instance, ﬁve—time Olympic medalist Bode
Miller claimed in an Associated Press article
last week that, “It’s absolutely embarrassing
that there are countries and people who are
that intolerant and ignorant.”

Whether athletes decide to boycott the
games or not, Russia’s notorious human—rights
track record has already marred the spirit of
the 2014 Winter Olympic games. An event
that’s supposed to promote peace and fairness
is taking place in a setting that has promoted
the opposite. And instead of talking about
the games themselves, athletes are forced to
consider whether they will be comfortable
in such a setting, creating not an aura of ex-
citement for the games, but one of cynicism
toward politics. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

After readingjulia Carpey’s column
on the Syrian crisis published on Mon-
day, Oct. 7, I’m_ disappointed by the
ahistorical Viewpoint expressed by the
columnist. The crisis in Syria has been
going on for about two years now, yet
it has only prompted military action
when President Bashar al-Assad alleg-
edly used chemical weapons on his own
people. Where were we when women
and children were being raped and mas-
sacred using “traditional” weapons?
Why the outrage now?

She justifies military intervention
by making an ill-advised parallel to the
Holocaust. I caution you and others to
restrain from making these overreach-
ing comparisons (Obama to Hitler, slav-

ery, lynch mobs, etc). The insurgency in

Syria is balkanizedand some factions

.are affiliated with Islamic extremists.

Why would we support these.factions

. when they are against anything West-

ern or American? This bears no similar-
ity to the Holocaust where six million
Jews were exterminatedin concentra-
tion camps. ‘

Also, why didn’t we see moral obli-
gation during the 1994 Rwandan geno-
cide? Our country was in a much better
state during that time, but we were si-
lent. Clearly, we pick and choose when
we feel like being the “world police.”

It might be selfish to suggest that our ..

country should stay out of this foreign

conflict, but our country is currently in

economic and political malaise. Yet we
have the audacity to go to other coun-
tries and promote democracy when our
country is barely functioning. Let’s take
care of home first before we even think
about putting boots on the ground in
another foreign conflict.

“Do any human beings ever realize
life while they live it?”

The simplicities and complexi-
ties of life are seen in narrative
descriptions in Thornton Wilder’s
1938 play “Our Town”, which dis— -
plays the lives of two families in a
ﬁctional town in New Hampshire

married and face death. Their story
outlines the play, creating a cycle
that is inherently relatable to a
wider human audience.

Each act deals with a speciﬁc
time in their lives, corresponding
to the previously stated themes.
The entire plot, or perspective if you
like, is told by the Stage Manager,
a sort of narrator who is privy to
everything within the town, and

seems to cue everything into place.

Following Wilder’s original
request that there be no set, and
that most props be implied by the
actors, the PPT created a set that
left much to the imagination (in-a
positive manner). The simplicity of
the set and the fact that the acting
space was delineated by a white,

circular line seemed to deﬁne a line 5

between past and present, between
ﬁction and reality and between the
viewers and the actors in the center
of the space.

Indeed, behind the simple set,
seemingly mundane plotline and
even character development, there
is a higher, metaphysical current
that runs through the work. As the
Stage Manager (Tom Atkins) di-

rects the action, telling the audience
what each act is themed around and
giving us insight into both the past
and the ﬁiture, there is a glimpse of
the bigger consequences of life and
death. He tells the Viewer that the
play was meant to show what life
was like in the early 1900s to an
audience of the future. ‘
Though this may seem like a
historical retrospective, it is not.
Rather, the PPT’s production of
“Our Town” brings humans from
another generation eye to eye "with
the past, uniting them with relat-
able themes, feelings and ponder-
ings. .
The metaphysical element of
the play — the idea that we are all
part of something larger but might

not take the time to realize it — is
summed up by the monologue of
the Stage Manager when he notes
that “There’s somethingway down
deep that’s eternal about every hu-
man being.”

The standout actor in the per-
formance was deﬁnitely Tom At-
kins, who took on the role of Stage
Manager —— the omniscient nar-
rator of the plotline. Atkins con-
vincingly played a complex part
that was neither in the time of the
play, nor the time of the viewer, but
rather seemed to ﬂoat in a sort of
ethereal realm. He was able to work
the stage convincingly, engaging
both the audience and the other

Trying to deny a chase fink between EDM and MDMA is a foolfs errand. M‘CT Campus

Senior Staff Writerl

The Internet is good atcoining ridiculous
terms. Take “chillwave,” for example. It’s

believed that an obscure blogger, after '

drowning in the chillgvibes of Toro y Moi’s
Causers of This, came uppwith the term
that maligned an entire movement.

Magnetic magazine, an electronic
dance music (EDM) magazine, might
have been the ﬁrst to use the phrase ‘Molly
Wars. The term refers to the long- overdue
discussion about the abuse of the drug
MDMA (commonly called “molly”) at
electronic music festivals.

It’s safe to say that the folks over at
Magnetic are all about defending EDM
from the haters — ﬁst pumping uncon-
trollably and ﬁghting off the “culture’s”
detractors with rays of good vibes, man.
They even took shots at The Pitt News’

own Brett Dresner in the thoughtfully ti- .

piece discouraging attendance at EDM fes-
tivals to prevent use of the drug Ecstasy.

Yosh, the article’s author, says
Dresner’s piece doesmore harm than

good because itrelies ‘on stereotypes
about EDM culture, and because we
should teach people how to do drugs. He
says that despite his writing about EDM
full-time, no one can truly understand the
culture. I get it — I’ve seen Dom Mazzetti
on dubstep.

What’s problematic about a full—time
EDM blogger taking shots at a college

newspaper’s opinions page because he A

has a Google news alert set for the term
“EDM” is that it truly does obscure the
discussion. There can only be a Molly War
if someone is defending it, and no matter
your views on drug policy, no one should
be defending drug abuse. :

T_he worst part of these Molly Wairs,
and the reason I’m disgusted that Mag-
netic magazine decided to publish this
article, is the pernicious nature of EDM
festival heavyweights’ comments in light
of the recent deaths at festivals.

It all feels like the NRA coming out
after Sandy Hook. Diplo, yvho’s worth

popular at these festivals, talked to Roll-

As South African photographer and

LGBTQ visual activist Zanele Muholi — ‘

joined on the stage by Lerato Dumse, a
participant in Muholi’s photography and
member of her activist group, Inkanyiso
— stared out at the modest audience
from the stage of the Carnegie Lecture
Hall on Tuesday night as a part of the
Carnegie Museum of Art’s 2013 Carnegie
International exhibition, she noted her

pleasant surprise at the incredible diver—'

sity of the viewers before her.

“This looks like the America I see on
TV,” said Muholi before delving into the
more serious matter at hand: her work as

a photographer and activist in document— -
ing the lives of the South African black .

lesbian and transgender communities, as
well as combating the hate crimes that
are becoming increasingly common in
her home country.

casting as George Gibbs was very strange.
The tall, gangly ﬁgure of Cannon awkwardly
attempting to portray an adolescent in both
maturity level and physicality didn’t quite
work. At times both Krorn and Carmon felt
like walking caricatures.

The PPT stayed true to Wilder’s original

intentions with “Our Town,” creating a sort
of breach in time that transports the viewer
to another era, but one with relatable themes
and life moments. Though their rendition of
“Our Town” had a few questionable acting

uniting the past with the present and ques-

. article, he points to society’s ills as a com-

mon impetus for drug abuse, arguing that
in EDM’s case, excess is the culture. -

Yosh took issue with this,» saying EDM
started in black, Hispanic and homosex-
ual cultures. I’m black, but I don’t think I
was at the "meeting where all the minority
groups met up to make music together
— darn. Nonetheless, it’s an interesting
point. The crack epidemic has an obvi-
ous genesis in Reagan-era cuts-to social
welfare programs that devastated low-
income and predominately black parts
of the country. ‘ .

In that case, society messed up pretty
majorly. However, as it currently stands,
EDM culture is perhaps the opposite.
Festival attendees are overwhelmingly
homogeneous: white and upper—middle

class. ‘The only societal ill faced here is -

boredom. -» , ~ 

But alas, Magnetic magazine isn’t just
an EDM blog; they’ve got a handle on psy-
chology, as well. Inanother wonderfully
titled piece, “EDM Culture: It’s Time To

"Talk About Drugs,” Hanna DeuPree has -

the answers.

tion of drugs? Because it is human nature.
As a race, we constantly seek happiness,
pleasure and gratiﬁcation. Look back to
the late 1800s when the Freudian pleasure
principlewas introduced to society,” she
said, adding that, “Of course-, not every-
one agrees with ﬁnding gratiﬁcation or

; happiness in stimulants, but most rec-

reational users will agree that it is the
easiest, fastest way to leaving reality and
embarking on an adventure through a
self—induced wonderland.”

If the claim that our human nature
makes us blindly seek pleasure-—— no mat-
ter what the cost ‘— sounds familiar, it’s

because it has been used as a cop-out time -

and time again for societal ills.
The bottom line is this: EDM is really

popular, and a lot of people are making '
a lot of money from it — you can even ,

be a full—time EDM blogger. And just like
the gun business, the dangers associated
with festivals are harmful to the bottom
line. It’s not about American drug policy
—— which certainly needs some amend-
ing, seeing as EDM’s founding races are
facing the brunt of the burden. It’s about
American greed. I

as ubiquitous. Gordon—Levitt plays this
character with cold detachment, whether
he is neurotically tidying his apartment,
boasting about his numerous sins in his
church’s confession booths or “losing
himself” (a.k.a. perusing Pornhub) in
the glare of his laptop. _

He’s a character completely isolated
within his fallacious ideal of what it is to
be a “man.” When Barbara comes along,
she represents his ideal counterpart,
exemplifying how a “woman” is meant
to look and act —— cue torturous trips to
romantic movies and refusing sex un-
til they’Ve met each Qther’s friends and
families. They’re thejersey equivalent of
Ken and Barbie.

The conﬂicts presented between Bar-
baraandjon point to some rather glaring
issues in modern media presentations
of men and women — that these made-
up\concepts of gender are not actually
compatible. These are playfully portrayed
in the pithy=back—and—forth dialogue be-

<Ddober10;20131TheFMiNewsiwwwvpmnemsconw

A tween the couple as]on’s addiction strains

their relationship.Jon’sjustiﬁcation that
“all men do it” seems’ lost on Barbara,
who retorts with the age-old cliche, “But
I thought you were different!”

Gordon-Levitt’s ﬁlm depiction of these
constructed ideals isn’t only present in
the script. His directorial ﬂare and sar-
donic self—awareness are simultaneously
demonstrated in a particular scene in
which Barbara convincesjon to quit porn
(albeit very brieﬂy). As the “st=ar—crossed
lovers” embrace, a sickly orchestral score
plays and the slow—motion is applied,
which is universal movie speak for “this
is an emotional moment.”

The futility of real life attempting to
imitate a ﬁctionalized media World is
the driving message of the movie. The
revelatory moment comes when Esther
(Julianne Moore), one of ]on’s peers in
the night class he attends, says that porn
isn’t real. In fact, the majority of media
consumed is not real, and Gordon—Levitt
relishes any opportunity to show how
this misconception has seeped into most
aspects of social and private life. This is
portrayed to beautiful effect during a mo-

ment at the family dinner table in which

J on and his father, Jon Sr. (Tony Danza),
are engrossed by a gratuitously sexual-
ized television ad in which a bikini-clad
woman salaciously consumes a burger
whileJon’s mother and sister remain un-
aware. It’s haunting, tragic and hilarious
all at once.

Gordon-Levitt communicates the un-
reality of the media, as well as how gender
roles, relationships and sex have been
distorted to grotesque proportions, in a
stylish and effective manner. However,
perhaps contradictory to what is being
expressed, the ﬁnal act is somewhat con-
trived and fictitious. In this respect, the
narrative panics and reverts back to the
romantic-comedy and drama tropes the
movie had been satirizing throughout.
But hey, no one’s perfect. ' ~

That said, the ﬁlm is still a thought-
provoking, unnervingly perceptive and
darkly humorous reimagining of a genre
that has been done to death. It also signals
the arrival of a director with a clear and
bold vision who isn’t afraid to tackle a
subject matter he cares about and who
is relevantto a modern audience. I

that doesn’t extend to other issues that
people face who are poor and black and
queer or poor and black and trans and all
the diﬁ"erent ways that our identities can
be layered,” Moor said after the lecture.

Part history lecture, part ﬁlm exhi-
bition and part conversation, Muholi’s
lecture walked viewers through a brief
history of LGBTQ issues in South Africa,
from the establishment of a constitution
that included LGBTQ individuals in 1996
to the legalization of same-sex marriage
in 2006. As she gravely explained, how-
ever, the expansion of legal rights for the
LGBTQ community has been undermined
by a rash of hate crimes against these
groups — particularly black lesbians.

According to Muholi, this disconnect
between the promise of protection under
the South African constitution and the
actual experience of the black lesbian
community has become a point of con-
tention for her.

“It’s one thing to say that we are

October 1Q, 2018 I The Pitt News I vvvvvv.pittnevvs.com

protected by the constitution, but it’s
another to see that the constitution is
practical,” Muholi said.

Of the hate crimes endured, Zuholi
said, the most heinous is known as car-
rective or curative rape, in which lesbian
women are raped by men in the belief
that the act will somehow change the
sexual orientation of the victim. Curative
rape has been documented by various
news outlets over the years, including a
2011 BBC article documenting the rape
and murder of Noxolo Nogwaza. Accord-
ing to the BBC report, Nogwaza was dis-
ﬁgured, stabbed and raped by eight men
and murdered nearjohannesburg.

Muholi noted after the lecture that
the roots of many of these hate crimes
lie in the traditional, often patriarchal
beliefs of many South Africans. “When
you think about hate crimes, and how
black lesbians are affected by hate crimes
speciﬁcally, you’re dealing with'a lot of
traditional spaces, where people assume
that by being black and by being a woman
you need to become somebody’s property
and be a traditional wife where you have
to take orders from your husband,” she

said.

As Muholi sees it, this structure
“needs to be challenged and also needs
to be undone, because it’s wrong. It puts
a lot of women in danger and means that
a lo_.t of women’s voices are silenced.”

Muholi’s work is not limited to pho-
tography. She notes that many of the
participants in her activism work with
Inkanyiso, including Dumse, are involved
in advocacy, as well, in some form or
another. -

Dumse said that she was ﬁrst drawn
to Inkanyiso when she discovered that
when Muholi took a portrait‘ photo, she
was “not just taking the photograph and
showing it to some Western people and
that’s it.” ,

Despite the weight of her subject mat-
ter and the crimes that she works to ex-
pose, Muholi‘ alsostrives to emphasize
the elements of love and intimacy that
she sees in the communities she docu-
ments. When asked what viewers should
draw from her work, her message was
clear. — . .

less lonely fans muttering “maybe in the
next world” before turning up The Queen
is Dead to a volume just loud enough to
deafen their ears and drown out the sobs,
but never dull the sorrow.

Luckily for these morose Morrissey
lovers, “the good of life is out there some-
where,” no doubt located in a little-known

-exception in U.S. copyright law called “fair

use.” According to The Los Angeles Times,
LoPrete’s lawyer Dan Booth has argued that
her work ﬁts perfectly into the deﬁnition
of fair use, as “she posts only snippets of
lyrics, puts them in a whole new context
and doesn’t make any money off them or
damage the market for the songs.” After
LoPrete and Booth ﬁled counter notices
with Tumblr pleading this case, Tumblr
stopped removing posts and UMPG sud-
denly ceased pursuing the case, allowing
avid readers of the Tumblr to rejoice and
say “I just might die with a smile on my
face after all.”

UMPG’s motives in coming after This
Charming Charlie are unclear; as was their
decision to apparently drop the complaints
the minute LoPrete lawyered up. However,
its aggressive ‘actions against a webpage
that at worst is harmless and at best re-
vives interest in one of the great “bands
of the ’8os might reﬂect the anxiety of a

large company for whom the 21st century

is no longer breathing down its neck but
staring it in the face. In an era in which
anyone who is Photoshop savvy can grab
asyndicated cartoon from one place and
start jotting in their favorite lyrics, the lines
dividing whose content belongs to whom
begin to blur. “
Naturally, music companies — many
of whom were badly burned by the rise of
Internet piracy and continue to feel the
effects to this day — feel nervous in such_a
brave new world. The fact that they would
ﬁle so many complaints against the page
within such a short period of time exempli-
ﬁes their newfound vigilance against any
and all perceived violations of their own-
ership rights. In many ways, the move by
UMPG bears a resemblance to a preemptive
strike, and had it worked, itlikely would
have been one. How many part-time blag-
gers are interested in incurring the wrath
of a music label’s legal team in response to
their innocuous cartoon creations?

Pitt hopes to achieve first road win against Miami

Andrew Stern
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter~

Pitt women’s soccer (4-8-1, 0-7 ACC) will

try to get back on track tonight as the team '

travels to face the Miami Hurricanes (7-4, 2-4
ACC). The game is one of two games that Pitt
will play in the state of Florida this weekend,
as they face Florida State aﬁ;er Miami. _
Head coach Greg Miller sees Miami as a‘

' dangerous team after their 2-0 win over N o.

4-Notre Dame.

“‘Miami has some momentum now, and
they are avery dangerous team coming offa
great win,” Miller said. “They’ve got a lot of
conﬁdence on their side, and they’re playing
at home in their own environment.”

Key player: Ashley Flinn

The Panthers must be cognizant of the
dangerous junior from Michigan, because
Flinn is liable to score every time she touches

BARNES BURNER

Saturday’ s g game against VirginiaTech most critical yet for Pitt

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football heads to Blacksburg, Va., this
weekend for a noon kickoff Saturday in Lane
Stadium against the No. 24 Virginia_ Tech
Hokies. Pitt’s three—game wining streak
may ﬁnd itself in jeopardy against a Vir-
ginia Tech team that has won ﬁve games in
a row since opening the season with a loss
to No. 1 Alabama. ~

But the talk of previewing whether or
not that will actually happen can wait for
tomorrow. -

Pitt (3-1, 2-1 ACC) currently sits in third
place in the Atlantic Coast Conference’s
Coastal Division. No. 13 Miami (1-0, 5-0
ACC) ranks second. ,

Alone atop the ACC Coastal Division
mountain is Virginia Tech (2-0, 5—1). And
Pitt is only a half—game behind the ﬁrst-place
Hokies.

Because of this, the Panthers’ game
againstvirginia Tech Saturday is the most
important game of Pitt’s season thus far and

of any other services —. because it wouldn’t.
Maybe if the Panthers won 70-0, but that
probably won’t happen. _ A
No, the importance of this game for Pitt
lies in evaluating just where exactly the team
is this year. The three-game winning streak

broke the “win two, lose two” pattern of
head coach Paul Chryst’s ﬁrst season.

But those wins, which were certainly
good wins, were expected. Pitt tookcare of
business against New Mexico, Duke and Vir-
ginia — teams the Panthers were expected
to dominate.

As an aside, seeing the Panthers win
games they’re supposed to win shouldn’t
go unappreciated, because it’s something

is the ﬁrst since the 2009 season, and it "

. potentially of the season as a whole.

If Pitt wins Saturday, the Panthers may '

_ see their names begin appearing in certain
polls. Meanwhile, Deadspin’s rankings of
the Panthers this season in the site’s weekly

Pitt needs a better effort from its offense this week. Bobby Mizia|Visual Editor

“125 FBS Teams, Ranked” started Pitt inlthe .

’50s and has the program at a season—l1igh

45 after the bye week.

This is not to say Pitt’s victory would A

vault it into the top 25 of those rankings or

Pitt didn’t do in recent seasons that ended
with the Panthers ﬁnishing below .500. See:
Sept. 1, 2012, vs. Youngstown State.

' But let’s get back to thelpoint — Virginia

' Tech is the mostmeaningful game Pitt plays

this year. Andnot just because of the old
cliche that ‘éthe next game is always the most
important game.”
, Coaches, players and teams look at
games that way, but we don’t have to.
What about Florida State? The game was
nice, but only really important for establish-
ing just how good Jameis Winston is. No
one learned anything about Pitt. Although
no one should approach a game thinking



played the No. 1, 3 and 9 teams inthe country.
Against No. 1 Virginia, the Panthers actually

enjoyed a 1-0 lead for a brief period. In the-

end, however, Vir aproved to be too much
for the young Panthers, as they-defeated Pitt
3_ _\ .

This season, the Panthers have been paced .
offensively by Roosa Arvas’ two goals and ‘

three assists. Goalie Nicole D’Agostino leads
the team’s defense, as she ranks ﬁfth in save
percentage and leads the ACC with 77 saves.

Miami’s season so far °

This season, the Miami Hurricanes have
struggled in the ACC, as the team has been
outscored in ACC matches 16-4. The Hur-
ricanes own a 2-4 record in the ACC so far,

with the highlight of conference play being

’ a 2-0 victory against Notre Dame. 0

Offensively, Ashley Flinn has lead the Hur-
ricanes so far this season. _ ,,

In the cage, the Hurricanes have used a
pair of goaltenders this season. Projected
starter Emily Lillard has allowed 18 goals in
11 games, good fora2.1 goals-against average.
The other goaltender for the ’Canes, Catalina
Perez, has slightly better numbers than Lil-
lard this season in just six games.

For Pitt, the matchup against Miami pre-
cedes another tough away game in Tallahas-
see, Fla., against the Seminoles. Eachgame
affords Pitt a chance to show improvement
on the road, as the Panthers’ stats read 1-3-1
while away from Ambrose Urbanic Field.

“We head to Florida State on Sunday.
Florida State is a very talented team. Again,
they’re playing in their home environment,”
Miller s,aid.“We haven’t been great on the
road this-year, so We’ve got to ﬁgure out
something different to try and put out a good

, product and get a result.” I

they’re going to lose, that was the realistic

result for the Panthers’ matchup with a team

now ranked No. 6 in the nation. .
If anything, the pomp and circumstance

for Pitt’s ACC debut on national television .

on Labor Day made the game anything of
relevance. Otherwise, it’d -be regarded as
highlyas FSU°s 63-0 demolition of Maryland
.this weekend. =

This weekend, welearn the most about
Pitt. It’s just the second road game forthe
Panthers and really the ﬁrst true road test
both in terms of talent and atmosphere

(sorry Duke and Wallace Wade Stadium).

And if what we learn proves to be a whole
lot of good material, awin sets the Panthers
up for a great deal of success before they’ve
completed the ﬁrst half of the season.

A win this weekend would leave Pitt 4-1
overall and 3-1 in ACC play, which would
vault Pitt over Virginia Tech into second
place by half a game. That’s assuming Miami

, takes care of business with the 1-4 North

Carolina Tar Heels to move to 2-0 in the

conference. . ;

But four wins before the halfway point

17

of the season, let alone three in conference
play, will go a long way toward assuring Pitt
something of higher relevance than the
BBVA Compass Bowl or AdvoCare V100
Bowl. an

Plus, a win over Virginia.Tech would
stretch Pitt’s win streak to four games. After
that, games against Old Dominion and Navy
(if the government reopens in time for the
game to be played) would likely allow Pitt
to enter November with a six-game run of
wins and a 7-1 record. I

would put Pitt neck—and-neck with Miami

Tech’s talented defensive line will put a

u lot of pressure on Pitt’s young offensive

line. '

Georgia Tech

It’s hard to drop the Yellow jackets
far after a loss to Miami. The Hurricanes
have proven to be a top—three ACC squad.
Georgia Tech played the Hurricanes well,
but it wasn’t enough. Thejackets are 34-4
under head coach Paul Johnson when
scoring more than 28 points. This team
needs the defense to get back to what

Johnson is used to seeing.

Maryland

The Terrapins’ game against Florida
State was a chance for them to cement
themselves higher in the rankings. A
decent performance would have gotten
them a lot of respect — they didn’t even
need to win. Now, Maryland’s just a 4-1

squad, UNC’s 27-17 loss to the Hokies is
nothing to be ashamed of. The Tar Heels
played with them and, as I said above,
even outgained them in yardage.

North Carolina State

For the sixth straight time at Wake
Forest, the Wolf Pack lost. This time, it
was a 28-13 loss to the terrible Demon
Deacons. I’ll give North Carolina State

.the benefit of the doubt partly because

no other schools deserve to be ranked
in the single digits and partly because
sometimes supernatural forces just don’t
let certain teams win at certain stadiums.

Boston College

The Eagles’ offense continues to be a
dangerous weapon for Boston College.
A week after scoring 34 points against
Florida State, Boston College ran by
Army with a 48-27 victory. Offensively,
Boston College will challenge a lot of the

- ACC defenses. . -

Syracuse
The Orange were beat up by the con-
ference’s bully. Most expected a loss. The

more troublesome part of the loss for V
’Cuse was the performance of its quar— S

terback. Terrel Hunt was 8—of—24 for
52 yards and three interceptions. Once
again, head coach Scott Shafer has a
quarterback decision to make.

Duke _

With games the next two weeks
against Navy and Virginia, the Blue Devils
could easily be 5-2 headed into their last

i - five games. Although Duke hasn’t looked

great this year, it could need just one win
in its ﬁnal ﬁve games to become bowl
eligible. After advancing to a bowl game
last year, the Blue Devils are trying to go

to back-to-back bowl games for the first

time ever.

Wake Forest _

Wake moves out of the bottom spot in
a big way after its win over North Carolina
State. The Demon Deacons showed some
life as senior quarterback Tanner Price
beat up on the Wolf Pack both through
the air and on the ground. Price passed
for 268 yards and three touchdowns and
ran for 82 yards and one touchdown.

Virginia .

Virginia’s defense is supposed to be its
strong unit, but the Cavaliers went and
gave up 48 points to Ball State. The 48—
27 loss to the Mid-American Conference
school ﬁrmly plants Virginia in last place
in the ACC and head coach Mike London
directly on the hot seat. I
