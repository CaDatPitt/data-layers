Reviewer Finds Unusually Good
Talent Reﬁected In Literary
Group’s Latest Magazine

It astounds us around The News of-
ﬁce to ﬁnd that Jean Barnes, who has
trouble covering .Freshman Council
and freshman unitis adequately, could
write anything like “Vii'tuoso,” ap-
pearing in today's edition of The
Journeyman, newest effort of Quill
Club.

“Virtuoso” seems to have some-
thing. It’s one of the better things in
a comparatively excellent magazine,
written by one who was inspired to
set to prose a few honest emotions in-
spired by a Mischa. Elman recital.

The Journeyman, as has been said,
is comparatively excellent. Compara-
tively, because in any undertaking of
this sort in any University, there's
seldom anything to grip either the
emotions or the intellect and electrify.

There’s nothing in the magazine
which will live forever, nothing which
will rivet the attention of the literary
world to the Point. But, it has offer-
ed a group of undoubtedly talented.
young intellectuals to see ‘their -efforts
in print.

A few personages from last year's
magazine are unfortunately not pres-
ent. Maxine Hirsh, president of the
Club and editor of the magazine last

man, and others who contributed last
year are decidedly missed. Miss
Hirsh’s “Aft,ernoon.Tea” was one of
the ﬁnest pieces of poetic insight
published on any campus.

But there are others to take up the
torch. And they hold it rather high.
It’s somewhat a Grace Ellis magazine
this time, with at least four contribu-
tions from this author. After one gets
through “Kundry,” a rather involved
sort of thing with too many unpro-
nounceable names scattered through it,
one gets to some meaty substance in
“Easter at Biloxi,” which has spots
of real writing in it. Her two poems,
“Pendant Threat” and “And This
Disparity,” though arty, seem sincere
and promising. She has talent—and

rise to the heights. .

Herrymon Maurer, a fugitive from
Pitt News columns this year, has writ-
ten a very learned tract on “The
Pessimism of Thomas Hardy,” which
will probably gladden the hearts of
the English department, but which
leaves those of us in the valleys under
Olympus somewhat disheartened. with
the obviousness of our own abysmal
lack of scholarship, .

Jane Bram’s “—And.No Regret” left

graphical errors in the proof we were
following were explained and the re-
versal of time sequence noted, the
short bit a.ssumed shape as a really
excellent job. It should prove popu-
lar. :'

Albert

Goldsmith writes interest-

“Przykiewicz Farm,” telling adequate-
ly the details of life “one thousand
years before the times.” _

Grace Quil has written charmingly
of “Marriage Rites in Southern China”
which should please all. And Helen
Mistrik’s “Albert’s Way” should ﬁnd
a following.

Among the poetry in an unusual bit
by Goldsmith called “1348.” Peter
Alapas writes in much the same style
and with excellent word choice on
“Pittsburgh Night.”

William Kohl treats at length “Lord
Jim and the Law,” which is an effort
to evaluate the motives in the life of
Conrad's great character.

Yetta Cohen’s “To C ,” a short
poem, holds up remarkably well until
a slight let-down heralds its end. Ed-
itor George McGiffin, president of
Quill Club, says something in “To a
Children’s A Capella Choir,” and,
consistent with his reputation, says
it expertly.

SFA President William Harvey has
«contributed a pleasant theme called
“Carburetor Conﬁdences,” which
frankly isn’t bad.

Further than these, the writer can't
discuss. Proofs of the remainder of
the magazine weren’t available, but
it's rumored that Edwin P. Banks, as-
sistant in political science, famous
for his “I Will Not Kill A Man” poem
last year, is again back between the
covers of Quill Club's magazine.——Ron.

In the last meeting of the Group X
series for this semester, Glenn U.
Cleeton, head of the department of in-
dustrial engineering at Carnegie Tech,
spoke on the subject of “New Facts
and Your Future.” In his talk, Mr.
Cleeton pointed out just what chance
University students have of getting
employment after their four years of
college life.

It is Mr. Cleeton’s opinion that the
choice of an occupation by a college
graduate is overestimated. He be-
lieves that the success of a person in
his vocational ﬁeld depends upon two
things: the breaks that he gets, and
the outlook he has upon his job. It
was found that students with high

A Quarter Asked

FTER SOME VERY HEATED controversy,
A the United States has upheld its Olympic
Games tradition and is sending teams to the

11th revival of the woi-Id’s greatest athletic fes-
Among them, it is
hoped, will be one or two fellows who studied their

I‘ track at Pitt.

- Everyone knows that sending such a horde of

‘athletes across the Atlantic, caring for them there,

and bringing them back when the Games are over

' is a mighty expensive proposition. In all fairness,

it may also be said, that former contributors, who
were lined up on the losing side in the recent con-
troversy','.deﬁn_itely insist they will not this time

1' oﬁer aid, thus making the ﬁnancing of the United

States entry more of a problem than before.

In sponsoring an Olympic Fund indoor track
meet, The Pitt News is attempting to make a def-
inite contribution by the University to help ﬁnance
the United States team, a place on which is the
most clierislied ambition of every collegiate track
athlete in the land. VVe do not wish to raise the
money in a “cliarity"’ niaiiner, and for that rea-
son have received permission from the athletic de-
partment to use the admission fees of the Univer-
sity's annual indoor track carnival, scheduled for
February 15.

The News does not expect to gather a fortune
from those receipts; it does intend to gather them
evenly. To that end, the meet will be the ﬁrst ab-
solutely “no comp” event in recent University his-
tory; everyone, including contestants, oiiicials, and
gentlemen of the press, will pay his way into the
Track House that afternoon.

Here is a chance for every University student
to get behind a. strictly University ,_venture. The

committee proinises to include tlicnaine of every’

ticket-purchaser along with the contribution it
sends to the Olympic Committee. And if it takes
a 2.0-cent postage stanip to mail the envelope con.

Systematic J ob-Hunting

SOME DAYS AGO the University’s Placement Bureau

sent a batch of cards to all senior men, asking that
they be ﬁlled out and returned to the Bureau oﬁice.
That is the ﬁrst step in the departiIieiit’s campaign to
secure positions for graduating men; it is by no means
the last.

There is something of a matter of interest in noting
that the Bureau has already “placed” three senior men,
meaning that positions Will be awaiting them when they
graduate in June. It may be signiﬁcant that each of
the three is in a. different school, one being in the Col-
lege, another in the School of Business Admiiiistration,
and the third in the School of Engineering.

The Bureau has established contacts in virtually every
ﬁeld of occupation, and through its efforts has aided
a great number of University graduates and has found
countless Jobs, running from selling shoes to stoking
furiiaces,_f_or undergraduates. Alumni of the University
in a position to hire men ﬁnd it an effective clearing
house for getting jobs for fellow alumni.

“All we ask,” says J. Clyde Barton, energetic director
of the Placement Bureau, “is that the student seeking em-
ployment will give us a chance. With his cooperation,
there is no end to the possibilities we may ﬁnd. With-
out that cooperation, our job is futile.”

The Bureau is now compiling a record of those mem-
bers of the class of June, 1935, who are now employed.
While not completed, the ﬁgures indicate that the depart-
ments batting average is better than 50; per cent. Ac-
cording to M1‘. Barton, the prospects for graduates this
year are even more bright. It may not be so bad to be
tui'iied‘out in June after all.

Students of English history who have memorized the
complete succession of Britain’s kings may now make
one or two additions to the list. George V (1910-1936);
Edward VIII (1936-?).

Trackmen Brush Up On Sales
TalksAs Beneﬁt Tickets Appear

If a slim young man in a dark coat
and heavy galoslies spots you on your
trip to that third hour in Alumni,
make no attempt to escape. For, he
will probably be one of Coach Olson's
ruiiners and, starting today, a. sales-
man de-luxe for the Pitt News Olym-
pic beneﬁt track and ﬁeld meet, sched-
uled for the Track House, Februafry 15.

Proceeds of the ticket sale will
go directly to the Olympic committee
for the American entry in the 11th
modern revival of the Olympic Games
in Berlin, Germany, next summer.
The entire ticket price of 25 cents on
each ticket will become part of the
Pitt donation. Expenses involved in
conducting the affair, such as entry
blanks, awards and the actual running
of the meet, itself will be taken care
of by The News.

Today, both the varsity and fresh-
man squads top off a gruelling training
period in preparation for the-ﬁrst meet
of the indoor campaign opening Sat-
urday. In this University-sponsored
event of the Allegheny Mountain As-
sociation of the AAU, Coach Olson ex-

pects to give his boys a thorough test

district athletes.

In an Intra-freshmaii meet last week,

Panther Five Meets Titans 0’“"é’e Mime" Carlsonmen DOWN Penn State, 45-23, .  
Floor Panthers To Gain First Conference Victory D'“° a_'},‘Tl_D°“°°

In S_t£l_dium Ifeature Tonight

Carlsonmen LookAhead
To Clash With Duke’s
‘Miracle Team’

By William K. Trosen

Once a year during tl1e past.
two years Coach John D. Lawther
and a \Vestminst.er basketball
team have traveled to Pittsburgh
with the sole intention of whip-
ping Dr. Carlson ’s Panther cagers.

Once a year during the past two
years Coach John D. Lawther and a
Westminster basketball team have
traveled back to New Wilmington
with a vow to get those pesky_ Pan-
thers next year.

Tonight these Westmi11ste1' Titans
return to meet the Panthers on the
Stadium pavilion in the third game of
their series. Both teams, this season,
have met with indifferent success but
never in the past have the Panthers
and the Titans failed to satisfy when
battling each other.

Up to date, the Panthers have drop-
ped ﬁve games, the Titans, three, In
the only other comparison possible be-
tween _the two teams, they stand
even, both being" whipped by Carnegie
Tech by practically the same margin.

Returning with Lawther are several
varsity players who left the Stadium
last year on the short end of a 38-32
count. W'es Bennett, the district’s
leading scorer for the last three years,
returns for his last appearance
against the Panthers. Wes, a depend-
able forward, has averaged between
14 and 15 points a game while playing
for Westminster. In his two games
against Dr. Carlson's boys, Wes has
scored a total of 21 points.

“Swede" Hunneke and Johnny Wil;
lits are the other two varsity mem.
bers who remember two Panther trim-.
mings. Both are exceptionally ﬁne
ﬂoormen and good shots. Paul Backus
and John Krivosh, both sophomores,
round out Lawther’s starting ﬁve.
They also saw action in las-t season's
game with the Golden Cats.

AS. to the Panther‘ make-up, the
starting team is in doubt. It may be
the ﬁrst team, with Captain Roderick
and Billy Jesko at forwards, Joe
Garcia at center, and Ed Spotovich
and Bob Johnson at the guards. Or
it may be the second team that has
Frank Loucks and Miles Zeleznik a_t
forwards, .Pete Noon at the center
post, and Rags Radvansky and Luke
Rowe at guards. Or it may be a com-
bination of the two.

During the mid-semest_er vacation,
the Panthers will travel to Annapolis,
Maryland, to meet the crack Navy
ﬁve on February 1. Last season the
Navy men licked the Panthers, 724-22,
at Annapolis. In ‘fact,’ the seamen are
one of the few teams that own an
edge in a series of cage battles against
the Panthers. In three meetings, the
Navy has defeated the Panthers
twice.‘ V .

And Then Those Dukes!

If there be those among the stu-
dent body who approach with fear and
trembling the terrible ordeal of com-
ing ﬁnal exams, let them but consider
the plight of the Panther cagers who
face not only the exams, butfthe de-
vastating demons of Duquesne Uni-
versity on the basketball ﬂoor two
days after mid-year vacation, on Feb-
ruary 6. " i ' ‘

Everyone took Duquesne’s early
string of victories with a grain _of
salt, for it was generally realized that
the Dukes weren't playing anyone in
the habit of wearing out the goal nets.
While the Bluffmen seemed to be out
for a new stratosphere record in
point-scoring themselves, countless
stories were written about the Duke's
plight in not being able to schedule
games with tougher teams.

Up on the Bluﬁ they have -letters
to prove that schools refuse to play
ball with them because the Dukes are
just too tough. Of course, there are
some who will say that the West-
minster team which plays Pitt tonight
is a pretty fair ball club, and it is ex-
tremely hard to imagine that those
basketball-mad Titans would not
jump at the chance to play a team
of Duquesne’s calibre. Westminster
defeated the Dukes in their last ball
game at Sharon, Pa.

It was only when Duquesne swamp-
ed Tech. a team which had previously
nosed out the Panthers, that the real
power of the Duke powerhouse came
to light. It was then that several of
the sports writers, who have seen
many very good ball clubs before, had
to resort to superlatives to describe
the Bluffites. “A wonder team.” wrote
one; “the perfect ball club," says an-

Lawther has compiled an enviable
record of 149 victories out of 177
games during his seven-year coaching
reign at the Titan school.

other. The ﬁrst half spurt which sank
the Tartans far below the water-line
was “17 minutes of perfect play,” with
the Dukes making “14 out of 20 shots”
and “never a bad pass.”

Descriptions of the perfection and
ease of the Duke's play will make
even the most rabid of Pitt rooters
(who will break down and tell you
conﬁdentially that Duquesne was
plenty good last year) confess that
maybe we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.

The situation has also given rise to
quips on the part of the town's
jokesters, who suggest that Dr. Carl-
son get his boys a quart of ice cream
instead of a pint, or perhaps effect a
change in the brand of cream served".
And one fellow even printed one about
the good doctor “thinking up the per-
fect alibi for the Pitt-Duquesne game."

It lookslike a pretty dark future
ahead for the Panther basketballers.
Maybe they ought to be excused from
the additional worry of exams. '

In Opening Meet

The claws of the Panther just
couldn’t scrape enough skin from a
tough bunch of Oranges last Saturday
night. As a result, Coach Schricker’s
mitt team lost to Syracuse by a 6-2
decision in its ﬁrst start of the sea-
son.

Pitt’s two points were scored by Al
Paslowski, 125-pound veteran, and Ted
Schmidt, heavyweight, who was mak-
ing his varsity debut. Paslowski, a
southpaw slinger, ﬂoored his oppo-
nent, Al Duke, three times in the sec-
ond round to earn a knockout victory,
and Schmidt won a three-round deci-
sion over D’Luski.

Frank Cimicata took over Dick Conti
in the 115-pound class, Jack Falgiano,
Orange lightweight, won a close bout
from Abe Konick, and Artie McGiv-
ern, intercollegiate champ, gained a
decision over George Dines.

Syracuse scored its other three
points via the knockout route. Mas-
trella stopped Herb Cummings in the
second round, and Fink and Jefferis
accounted for technical knockouts
over Leonard and Linderman in the
last round of their respective bouts.

The summary:

115'-pound class —- Cimicata (S) defeated
Conti (P), decision.

125-pound class—Paslowski (P) defeated

row, Dr. Carlson ﬁnally got his Panth-
er cagers to keep on playing until the
ﬁnal whistle, and as a result, the
Golden Cats swamped the Penn State
Lions, 45-23, in an Eastern Intercolle-
giate Conference game last Saturday
at State College. It was their ﬁrst
victory in the conference this season.

The scoring for the Panthers found
the entire ten players contributing to
the Lions’ downfall. Four Panthers
counted ﬁve points, four more tallied
four markers, Loucks sank one basket,
and Garcia led the parade on the has-
ket with seven points.

Dockey Kowallis’ Little Panthers
made the night complete by easily de-
feating the State freshmen, 31-18, in
the preliminary game. It was the Pitt
freshies ﬁfth triumph in ﬁve starts.

Bill LeRoy’s Town Tattlers

W_il_l_ Play For Heart Hop

B a l 1 re 0 m Decorations
To Feature Event
At Schenley

It’s leap year, but that isn't the rea-
son that the coeds are looking the eds
over carefully before February 7. It’s
the Heart Hop that has the women
scanning the men in their neighbor-
hood and sending out invitations to
a dance.

In the midst of hearts and cupids,
decorating the walls of the Hotel
Schenley ballroom, the women and
their escorts will dance to the music
of Bill LeRoy and his Town Tattlers
Orchestra from 9 until 1 o’clock. Le-
Roy's organization is one of the best
known bands for campus alfairs. In

the past he has played for College.

Association, Pitt Riﬂes, Scabbard and

Blade, Panhellenic, Freshman, and
Cwens-Druid dances. His music has
also been heard at 97 fraternity

dances.

Six members of the band are stu-
dents or alumni of the University.

Le Roy himself graduated from the
School of Business Administration last
June.

Beginning at 11:30 o’clock, the
music will be broadcast over WWSW
for half an hour. Another broadcast
has been tentatively scheduled for
earlier in the evening.

Tickets went on sale this week,
priced $1.50 a couple, and may be pur-
chased from any member of the com-
mittee, or at the Heinz House-

This dance is the second annual
Heart Hop to be sponsored by the four
Women’s classes. The affair was
originated to help ﬁnance class prol-
ects and also to afford the women
an opportunity to entertain the men
for a change.

Margaret Speer, Ed36, senior class
president, is chairman of the com-
mittee which is composed of members
of the executive class council plus
other representatives from each class.
Betty Wainwright, BA37, is business
manager. '

’35 Retail Bureau
Bulletin Released

Experts In Fields Of Retail Study
Write For Annual Publication

The Retail Bureau Bulletin, pub-
lished annually by the Research
Bureau for Retail Training has been
distributed. It was edited by Miss
Carlotta Beatty of the Bureau.

With the problem of the retailer in
mind, experts in the ﬁelds of leader-
ship, management, personnel and
training, and merchandising were ask-
ed to write for this edition of the Bul-
letin. Dr. David R. Craig, former di-
rector of the Research Bureau for Re-
tail Training, contributed an article on
“The American Retail Federation.”
Dr. -Craig is at present the director of
research at the American Retail Fed-
eration at Washington, D. C.

Miss Nancy L. Larson, supervisor
of shopping service and market
surveys at the University’s Bureau,
describes in her article, “Service Shop-
ping and How It Is Done,” her activi-
ties as supervisor of one of the most
valuable services given by the Bureau
to the Pittsburgh member stores.

The fall survey based on 1,015 shop-
ping reports of selected shoppers in-
dicates that: “Customers are more
concerned about the sa1esperson’s
knowledge of merchandise than about
prompt approach. Customers depend
on the salesperson to give satisfactory
selling points about the merchandise.”
The shoppers also learned that the
customer wants a salesperson to be
able to locate merchandise quickly
and to maintain an interest through-
out the sale.
