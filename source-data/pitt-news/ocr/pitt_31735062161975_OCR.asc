Strike continues

Jonitors Deny Report of Offer

BY BILL HADUCK

The report of a University contract
offer to the striking Pitt janitors
was denied ‘yesterday by Union
officials but confirmed by the
University. v

“There is no new offer,” David
Glavin, President of Local 29. told a
meeting of about 300 striking union
members at Hotel Webster Hall.

Joseph Dutton, Vice-Chancellor of
Operations for Pitt, contended
however, the University did make a
new offer. “An offer was made to
the negotiating team. The
negotiating team did not take it to
the union.”

The strike, which today enters its
sixth day, appeared to be far from
over as Glavin told a cheering
crowd, “I'll ﬁght till the last ounce

' of blood is left in my veins."

He said it is Pitt's position that
“it'll take a four week strike” to
settle in favor of the union. “They
don't want to offer us anything
until we go back to work."

Dutton, who was reached at
home, said “We've offered what
we believe is a reasonable“ settle-
ment. He contended Pitt “is
hoping to hold out." '

He said a settlement might be
reached by injunction and
mentioned the possibility of hiring
“another group" of people” to take
the place of the strikers.

~ Glavin said the University last

week tried to force an injunction
but the attempt failed. Pitt tried to
show, he said, “that as a result of
what we were doing, there were
rats and mice running all over the
place."

Dutton was optimistic an injunc-
tion would be handed down. “We
expect an injunction. We think we
should have had it on the tail-end of
last week. but we expect one this
week." Dutton also said he didn't
expect any violence.

Noting some violence that has
occured already due to the strike,
Glavin spoke of slashed tires and
claimed that one of the supervisors

of the negotiating committee told

him. “ ‘You should have seen what
they did to my car.’

“If you’re caught you can be
punished,” Glavin told the mem-
bers, “but just In the ‘ event
anybody accuses you, just for
God's sake, keep your mouth shut.
“We're not going to be a patsy on
this thing,"'he said. “We’re at
war. We're not going to take away
our picket -lines, and if anyone
comes to make deliverys, we’re
going to request them to honor our
picket lines. But," he added. “we
don't want to hurt anybody."

It has yet to be decided if the
strike is fully legal and according to
Glavin there will be a hearing today
to decide that issue.

Food, f/efuse trucks pass pickets

Strike Supporters Permit

BY TOM VERBISH
Violence was avoided Friday
when members of the Ad Hoc
Strike Support Committee, picket-
ing the Forbes Avenue delivery
entrance to the Towers, agreed to
step aside, permitting food and
refuse trucks to use the docking
area within.
Ralph Terry, secretary-treasurer
of the Service Employees Intema-

‘tional Union, told nearby Local 29

pickets and committee members,
“We cannot become involved in a
secondary boycott. This would be a
violation of the Taft-Hartley laws.

“Our immediate concern must be
the health hazard posed by the
buildup of trash in the dormitories.

“Please don't do anything which
will give the University an
injunction against the strike at the
hearing Monday morning."

Terry urged the Committee to
picket elsewhere on campus, while
striking workers said, “The Com-
mittee is our only hope. Once the

Government Election Code. Article
V, Section III of the code has been
violated.

The Elections Committee has
decided to publicly disclose these
violations in accordance, with

The strikers were enjoined by
Common Pleas Court Judge War-

interfering in Szabo deliveries.

An angry exchange of words took
place between Terry and striking
workers when it became apparent
the Committee, formed by stu-
dents, professionals and faculty
members, was leaving.

Workers accused Terry of “selling
out to the University."

He responded by telling one
picket, “If that's what you think,

Fodzen Officially Resigns;
Denies Conflict with Gil 1

BY DAN DEELY

Campus Police Chief Robert
Fadzen officially resigned Friday,
denying reports he was quitting
due to differences with his
superior, Joseph Gil, Director of
Health, Safety and Security.

After less than two months on the
Pitt force, Fadzen. 43, will return to
his former job in the City police
training division February 1.

“I feel like a ﬁsh out of water.”
Fadzen said, “I don't think I'm
doing myself, my family and the
University any good by staying. I
miss my old job.

“I've spent all my adult life as a
Pittsburgh Policeman and I was
happy doing it," Fadzen explained.
“My family and I are very close
and they noticed a difference in me
after I left the City police. When I
worked with the City I was doing
what I do best.”

Deliveries

run against me in the next
election."
Spokesman for the Committee,
Stefﬁe Brooks, said, “No further
action is contemplated by our
group until the rank and file union

meeting Sunday. Our basic

problem continues to be building‘ 

student support for the strike.”

During the confrontation between
Terry and the pickets, Sulleiman
Bey, a pedestrian not connected
with the strike, was hit by one of
the exiting refuse trucks. It was
not determined if he had suffered
any injury.

BY KAREN SMITH

The establishment of a dynamic
communications network linking
Commonwealth black students’
associations is the goal of state-
wide Black Active Students Inter-
Collegiate Struggle (BASICS) con-
ference sponsored February 22-24
by the Pittsburgh chapter.
“We're performing a viable
communications link between ad-
ministrators. faculty, students and
the community which has long
been needed for the proletariat in
the historical dialectic," said
Henry A. Coogler. chairman of
BASlC's Pittsburgh chapter.
The purpose of this communica-
tions link Coogler said, is “to set
up a vanguard for black students to

counteract the depressive and
repressive situations that black
students have been subjected to in
the past century and to progress
and update the present educational
system to make it more relevant to
contemporary living."

Henry C. Gaston, a coordinator of
BASICS is optimistic the group can
overcome its problems.

“This is a very complicated link.
Many people are saying this can't
come off but it will work. We are a
a “bad" black people. I'm glad we
can have faith in our Black Student
Union." Gaston said.

To insure the success of the
conference Gaston said, ‘.‘We need

Fadzen said the recent firing of A

Officer Edward Foster, who was

accused of brutality, had nothing to

do with his resignation. -Fadzen

explained he fired Foster and had_
not been pressured to do so.

Any bad feeling between the
campus police and Gil had been

wrongly associated with his resig. '  f

nation, Fadzen indicated. He could

think of no reason. for such a"

connection. Fadzen said if he
couldn't have returned to his Oldx

job, he still wouldn't have stayed at ‘ _ I

Pitt. Being chief of a private police
force was like being an adminis-.
trator, and not like day to day
police work, he explained.

Fadzen joined the City police as a
patrolman in 1954, and served as
a homicide detective from 1957 H 
until 1963, when he joined the ' P‘
police training division.

Juvenile Delinquents,Cerebral Palsy

YMCA Adds Two New Volunteer Programs

BY FELICE NEWMAN
Pitt YMCA is instituting two new
volunteer programs, Project War-
rendale, which works with
juvenile delinquents and, in con-
junction with United Cerebral
Palsy. a cerebral palsy education
program.
The cerebral palsy tutoring
program is an attempt to help
victims of cerebral palsy function
as individuals in society. The
students, ranging in age from 18 to

50, will include the severely
afflicted, as well as the more
ambulatory, independent
individuals.

Volunteers, who need not be
certified, will participate in three
main areas of instruction: GED
preparation, for those working
towards high school diplomas, Life
Enrichment and How-To-Do
courses, and Basic College Level
courses.

Joy Maffei, coordinator of the
program. said, “Many cerebral
palsy individuals have been forced
out of their schools. Most schools
scan’t handle them."

According to Maffei. many need
preparation for College Boards.

“They want to get a grasp of their

“We’re trying to get involved with
people that want so much to get
into society, but are rejected.”

students at least twice monthly in
small groups. The curriculum will
be determined by the resources of

plained “The purpose of the
project is to build one-to-one

The boys will be bused to Oakland

The Exorcist

/\/lost Horrifying Film Ever

BY DREW PROVAZNIK

In the past decade, I can think of
only three movies that I have found
very frightening——Pittsburgh’s own
The Night of the Living Dead,
Robert Wise's The Haunting and
Black Sabbath with Boris Karloff.

However. the sheer horror and
fright in these ﬁlms was like
watching Mary Poppins when

compared to The Exorcist. William
Friedkin has certainly directed the
most horrifying movie ever made.

The film succeeds in that it is so
chilling that a viewer will remem-
ber it ten years from now. The
Exorcist also succeeds because it is
a most provocative picture.

The Exorcist can be best
described as a "Catholic film."
The picture explores a ritual that is
wholly Catholic and seldom talked
about--that is the ritual of exorcism
which is still performed today by
the Catholic Church.

The film protrays evil in most ugly
and repulsive ways.
asociated with urination, vomit,
blasphemy, obscenity, terror and
Satan. As a result, the evil
portrayed becomes a powerful

'incentive to reaffirm a Christian’s

belief in Christ and the Church.
On the technical side besides
outstanding directing. there is
some astounding photography.
The film's beginning contains an
Iraq sequence which concludes
with some shots of a huge statue of

Government, its responsibilities and its power based in experience.
Perhaps more important than our endorsement is the fact that there
are only two candidates out of 16 which we felt were qualiﬁed to
- represent the students on this campus. That’s a pretty sad comment
. on next year’s Student Government Board since 7 of those 16
 candidates will be elected to office--precluding a write-in candidate.
The two presidential candidates, Tina Adachi and Mike Furick had
serious deﬁciencies which made them poor candidates for the oﬂice.
Adachi, a member of the Young Socialist Alliance, has had no prior
. V experience with Student Government. She is unrealistic in her desire,
4 to mobilize the student body to attend political mass meetings--she
 . " does not perceive the campus atmosphere accurately. '
‘ , Ftn'lck’s most serious drawback is that he served on last year’s
 . Board--with very poor results. He was often not in attendance, and
__when he was, he was not very fruitful--he accredits himself with no
nnjor accomplishments after a year’s work on the Board. Eurick’s
campaign promises are hacimeyed and unexciting.
The major drawback with all the candidates excepting Kablach and
_ _ Keeler, is that prior to the campaign, they have made no attempt to
' expose and rectify the examples of ‘Buraucratic bungling’ which they
all so ﬁercely decry now, in an attempt to secure the students’ votes.
These candidates appear naive and misinformed as to the structure of
the University administration and the workings of Student Government
within that structure.
None of them promise or seem to exhibit the dedication,
resourcefulness or level-headedness demanded by the office which
they seek.

We realize that a new Student Government president must be
inaugurated in February. Because neither of the candidates running
for president is in our estimation a prospect for an outstanding
president, we find that our only recourse is a write-in candidate.

We therefore, endorse Bill Kilson as candidate for president.

Throughhisrecordofassociaﬂonwiﬂrstudentorganizationsandthe
Administration, Kilson has shown he enirodies those qualities
essentialforapresidentofstudent Government. He is a synbolic
choice,forheexempIiﬁesthekindofindividualwhoshouldbe
entrusted with the highest student omce at Pitt.

Although we recognize his present responsibilities in the Black Action
Society (BAS) make it impossible for him to seek this office, we feel
students should see that capable, responsible leadership does exist on
this campus. In the fixture. it is this leadership which students must
come to demand from their government.

Making t:heVoté Craunt

BY RICHARD SWARTZ AND
sco'r'r MACLEOD
in a break with tradition, the Pitt
News interviewed each Student
Government candidate to deter-
mine their position on important
issues. Excerpts from those
interviews. appeared in three
installments last week.
Appearing today is a brief
summary of those interviews. It is
not intended to serve as a voting
guide, but rather as a refresher for
those who know the candidates and
the issues but sometimes have
difficulty in connecting the two.
The brief summary of each
candidate is not necessarily the
candidate’s position today on the
eve of the election, but it was their
position when interviewed by the
Pitt News last week.

ing of Student Government by
mobilizing students around major

Elections: A Dismalz Year Ahead?

BY RICHARD SWARTZ
AND SCOTT MACLEOD ,
The annual dearth of interest in
Student Government elections has
affected still another area this year:
the quality of the candidates.
The fact that only 7 of 16 aspirants
can boast of formal, working
experence within Student Govern-
ment needs no further clarification.
it is not what dreams are made of.
What is far more disturbing,
however. is that a substantial
number of the candidates (all of
whom were interviewed by this
newspaper) have no fundamental
knowledge of the critical issues in
this campaign.

' A traditional slogan was on too

many lips: ‘‘I want to improve the
communications between the
students, the Board, the faculty,
and the Administration.”

Hence, there can be little
drum-beating for most of the
office-seekers, particularly the
three presidential hopefuls.

Mike Furick, a current Board
member, has been credited with
doing and “inadequate job” by an
authoritative source, Board Presi-
dent Rege Kaufman. By his own
admission. Furick has spent an
average of 12 hours per week in the
Student Government office, which
has him running a close second to
the nighttime janitor. Through his
inability to cite any personal
achievements during our interview,
it is obvious more time should have
been allocated.

This newspaper has been the
target of considerable criticism
from Furick, suggesting we expend
greater effort in dealing with

I

campus issues. When questioned
about the specifics of these and
other allegations, it was learned
that much of his information was
grossly inaccurate. On matters
such as these, we suggest that
Furick think before he speak and
obtain the facts before he think.

Another presidential candidate,
Tina Adachi, has presented in-
novative goals concerning the
direction of Student Government.
However, some of her objectives
have been extensively colored by
the doctrine of the Young Social-
ists’ Alliance, permitting her to
rationalize realities to fit the YSA
mold.

She defends her absence from
SGB meetings, maintaining their
agenda holds no particular concern
for her. But in the same breath,
she is quite vehement over the
disbursement of $1200 for yellow
Homecoming visors. How can this
not concern her?

Jeff Sekerka, the write-in hopeful,
has some experience in committee
work, but seems to have borrowed
too many timeworn promises from
past elections. We are unable to
ﬁnd anything distinctive in his
entire campaign platform, and our
suspicion is he's being coached by
those familiar with the success of
such tactics: last year’s winners.

Pat Kablach and Bruce Keeler are
the only two candidates who
distinguish themselves from the
rest.

Although a lackluster campaign
could threaten her chances of
winning, Kablach presents both an
enviable record and mature atti-

.tude,. surely the only one of the
"slxteen to possess both qualities.

Keeler is only a freshman, but he
has a surprising knowledge of the
Student Government machinery
due to his unflagging attendance
and scrutiny of regular meetings.
His ‘enthusiasm is unparalleled
among the other candidates, which
infers he will inspire, if not coerce,
the Board into working hard.

Yaier Lehrer is another candidate
who is worthy of attention. He
certainly does not merit the praise
of Keeler and Kablach because he
has not yet proven to be an
industrious participant in Student
Government. However, his exper-
ience with various organizations
and his grasp of the operations of
Student Government, something
which a large number of the
candidates lack, puts Lehrer one
step above the rest.

Only one of the sixteen
candidates seems clearly unworthy

of being elected. He has had his ‘

chance and wasted it.

Bob Heister, who one year ago
won a position on the Board, has
perhaps worked hard, but without
concrete direction. When
questioned about his failure to

accomplish any signiﬁcant work, .

Heister claims the University
bureaucracy is too large and moves
“like a turtle”, and therefore,
problems cannot be dealt with
decisively and expediently.

This is the wrong attitude for a
leader.

'He literally insulted the intel-

ligence of student voters when he
chose not to attend either of the two
“Meet the Candidates” programs.
Apparently, Heister thought
students don't have any questions
to ask. _

Letters to

Endorsement

Dear Sharon,
First of all I'd like to make myself
clear that I am speaking for myself,

And in no way do the comments
below reﬂect that of the Student
Government Board, its commit-
tees, or its workers.

I’ve spent and dedicated nearly an
entire year to the operation of
Student Government here at Pitt.
And I find that I’ve got vested
interests and programs that I would
like to see furthered and com-

’ pleted. This is why I considered it

important to speak to the issue of
enforsements of Student Govern-
ment Board candidates.

For president of the Student
Government Board, I feel that the
best candidate is write-in JEFF
SEKERKA. Jeff is a hard worker
with a great deal of common sense,
and a genuine desire to learn. Last
year, he worked as a representative
on one of our Senate Committees,
and ever since his decision to run
for President,_he has shown me
that he’s the best person for the
job.

Mike Furick has had his chance
this year, and in mylopinion, he did

4 an inadequate job. I’d hate to see a

similiar performance by him in the
position as SGB President.

Tina Adachi’s campaign is cen-
tered around her ability to mobilize
students on this campus. This I
feel is impossible to do except for a
football or basketball game. Also, I
don’t believe that she represents

‘  

   

 

contests are brought forth after the
election, we will have the facts

the Editor

before they are blown out of
proportion.

The main function of the SGEC is
to conduct a fair and honest
election. This is the main concern
of the committee, a concern that
THIS committee will NOT put
aside. It is not our responsibility to
judge who is the most qualified to
hold ofﬁce. It is our responsibility
to allow the entire student body to
make the decision on who THEY
wish to represent them in the
coming year. This is why the
present SGEC has fought long and
hard to assure the students this
right.

Finally, this committee has tried
to make it easier for all candidates
[who follow the election code
consistently] and voters to come to
the SGEC with complaints.

the true concern of the Pitt
undergraduate. Her ideas are too
left wing, and I feel that the
administration of this school would
close their doors to her if elected;
one thing that I would hate to see
happen.

Regarding the candidates for the
Student Government Board, the
candidate I support totally is PAT
KABLACH. Her knowledge of the
allocation process, her sparkling
record of dedication and her’
common sense qualify her as an
excellent board member, one that
can affect positive change here at
Pitt.

One ﬁnal point, may I stress the
importance of voting, it is your

chance to voice an opinion. Thank

you Granted that the system we are

working under is not the best
possible system, it is nevertheless
the system under which we_ must
function. Above all, the SGEC has
attempted to deal with all
complaints and questions~in a fair
and just manner. Accusations
made against the comm_ittee in
regards to our integrity are totally
unfounded and attempts to paint
the committee as a body of
“dishonest and unfair” individuals
is an insult not only to the
committee and SG but it is also an
insult to the great number of
students that comprise the under-
graduate population on this
campus.

Board President

Technicalities

Dear Editor:

In the past few days, the SGEC
has come under fire from indivi-
duals for being too concerned with
“technicalities." Primarily the
SGEC is concerned with candidates
following the election code. In
order to make sure that misunder-
standing and major violations do
NOT occur, the committee has held
fact-finding inquiries into com-
plaints and questions brought forth
to us. The SGEC has recognized
the need to find out what’s

Pitt versus Kent State track meet

 . as the Tracksters romped 104-35.

‘j"Romped might not be the right

‘ word. Pitt dominated taking the

first .three_ places in seven events
. and finished first in six others while

Kent State could manage only

three.

Coach Banner retained his cool.
calm appearance while standing in
the steaming locker room. ‘‘It was

the high point total. We thought

Everyone contributed but the two
standout performers had to be Billy
Rea and Andre Harris. Billy
competed in four events winning
thelong jump, placing second I the
triple jump, third in the pole vault,
and was second in the 300 yard
-dash before a KSU player knocked
him off the track.

Talking to Rea (who bears a
striking resemblance to actor David
Hartman( after the meet. it was
learned he had been hurt in the
long jump but refused to stop
competing. -

"When I hit the pit on my
secondjump I reinjured an injury I
got while touring Russia last

summer. I still placed first but the

today I wasn’t satisfied."

“I was right up in there in the
300,” Billy continued, “but just as
I was coming into the turn, the Ken
State guy saw me making my move
and pushed me right off the track.
I stumbled but stayed on my feet
while he fell,” he added.

The Pitt Invitational coming up
next week seemed on Billy's mind
as he stood on the track after the
meet. “The competition at the
Invitational is always good with a
lot of top performers." Then
smiling he added. “I've never lost
an invitational yet so I've ‘got
something to work for."

Andre Harris was another top
performer Saturday. He tied a
school record for the 60-yard urdles
in the time of 6.2 seconds. The
Brooklyn native had run the event
as a freshman and tied the record
then but last yer hamstring injuries
kept him from competing.

“I have to say I’m satisfied with
my performance today. Satisfied,
not happy. I really wanted a 6.0. I
ran a 6.2 and won but did you see

Commenting on the team as a
whole. "The team looked really
good. Everyone is helping out and
pulling together. But we all will do
better as the season goes on."

Curtis Smith came by very upset
about the 50 yard dash. “I was

Who would have believed it?

Who could have even imagined
that the Pitt basketball team. 12-14
last season. would be in sole
posession of the longest winning
streak in major college basketball?

Well. it's true. The combination
of Notre Dame's upsetting UCLA
Saturday and Pitt's thrashing
Buffalo at the Field House, 101-75.
has made the 14-] Panthers just
that.

Not even Pitt head coach Buzz
Ridl expected things to go so well
this season. “We had no right to
expect to win 14 straight games,"
he said- “But we did earn it, and I
feel very good about it for our
team."

Led by Mickey Martin’s 26 points
and Billy Knight’s 25, the Panthers
overcame their early-game slug-
gishness to route the winless Bulls,
now 0-1]. 7" '

“Buffalo's record is very de-
ceiving.” said Ridl. “This game
was a real test of our mental
attitude. to see if we would let
down for a game like this."

For a while. it appeared that that
was going to happen. Buffalo
broke to a 4-0 lead. and kept the

' will take time."

Later Banner commented on

Harris and Rea, “Andre is having‘

problems on the‘ first hurdle.

Coming off the hamstring injury is
rough but he can do it and will
improve." “Billy has a back
spasm." he went on. “he still

score close for the first five minutes
of the game. Poor Panther
shooting and slowness in getting
back on defense gave the ou‘t-
classed Bulls a chance to stay even
with the Panthers.

A Buffalo time out helped break
the game open. A little pep talk by
Ridl, who reminded the team that it
wasn’t going to be a cakewalk, and
the insertion of fresh troops, Ken
Wagoner, Keith Starr, and Lew
Hill, gave the Cats the.edge they
needed.

An aggressive Pitt defense caused
Buffalo turnovers. and as the Pitt
shooting improved. the Cats broke
away. Knight popped in eight
straight points as Pitt scored 12in a
row to go ahead 21-17. Following a
Buffalo bucket, Starr popped in six
points before the Bulls could score
again. and Pitt was off to its 14th
straight. V

The leading scorer for Pitt was
‘iMartin, who sunk 12 out of 21 shots
and added two free throws for 26
points. tying his career high game
against Syracuse two years ago.
Micket repeatedly found himself
open under the hoop. and had
many easy hoops.

“Our guards were spotting me
underneath all game,”‘_said the
blond-haired Baldwin High grad,
who always points out the man that
set him up for a hoop. The
backcourtmen kept Martin pretty
busy, as Starr alone picked up nine
assists, and the team totaled 27.

Pitt coasted to a 49;29 halftime
lead, then started out a little cold in
the second half. allowing_Buffalo to

Annihilate  
Penn State

BY YAIER LEHRER

After losing their opening meet
ofthe season in a very close contest
with Bucknell, one of the best swim
teams in the East, the Panthers
came back with a vengeance. using
the Nittany Lions as their victims,
the Cats obtained a crushing
victory of 99-16.

In a meet which saw the Cats do
no wrong, except ‘for allowing the
Lions to grab two second places.
the Pitt team took first place in
every single event of the contest.
There is no question but that Pitt
simply overpowered the men from
State College.

Carlos Santiago and Mark Wal-
lace both broke the Penn State pool
record in the 200-yard backstroke,
with Santiago edging out Wallace
for the first place. Last year, Pitt
may have taken either first or
second in that event and would
have nothing to follow it up with.
They can now take both first and
second. and this is only one
example of the great depth which
Coach Bradshaw has built up in the
team over the past two years. ‘

His depth has allowed him to
move Eric Wallace, primarily a
free‘-styler into the individual
niedley and breast stroke. The
move has turned out very well as
Wallace won the individual medley
at Penn State and took second place
to John Templin of Pitt in the
breast stroke in the same meet. ‘
