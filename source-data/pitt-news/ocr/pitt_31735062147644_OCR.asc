T h r e e Centuries
Of Political Ideas

Conﬂict In Revolutionary Thought
ls Subject At Social Science
Seminar Meeting Friday

The only point on which modern po-
litical philosophers agree absolutely,
after 300 years of revolutionary theory,
is that kings do not rule by divine
right.

W'ith this introduction, Dr. Mont R.
Gabbert, professor and head of the de-
partment of philosophy, addressed the
Social Science Seminar Friday after-
noon on, “Conﬂict in Revolutionary
Theories."

The ideology of the opposition to
the 17th century Stuart claims provid-
ed the beginning of the speech. Then
through the doctrines of Hobbes,
Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Bentham,
Malthus, Hegel, and Marx, Dr. Gab-bert
traced the development into con-
temporary philosophy of revolt.

“If I were asked to name the out-
standing product of nineteenth cen-
tury thought,” he said, “I should put
forward the population theory of Mal-
thus.” This, ﬁrst of all, destroyed
the blind optimism and belief in
man’s perfectibility of the eighteenth
century thinkers. It put to rest such
notions as Godwin’s anarchism. Fur-
ther, it was the basis for the shift
from Adam Smith’s economy to the
iron law of wages and rent theory,
and indirectly influenced Hegel and
Marx.

Governmental Role Changes

The greatest change of all, the
speaker showed, has been in the con-
ception of the role of government.
lvhereas Hobbes had called govern-
ment the agency of man's removal
from life that was poor, nasty, brutish,
and short, modern thinkers reverse the
process. They accuse government in
the tone of Lenin’s_. “Religion is the
opiate of the people,”. or of Samuel
Johnson’s, "Patriotism is the last re-
fuge of a. scoundrel.”

It is easier to effect revolutions to-
day than 300 years ago, said Dr. Gab-
bert. Formerly one rhad to .-apologize
for his point of view with elaborate
re feren ce~"*-to*'tlie~‘~"r1i’d'i"ti7llt‘_'V" or‘h'ts“'"pcs‘ii‘
tion. But morality no longer enters
into revolutionary concepts.

So fa.r have these theories gone
from their precursors that Marx was

_ able to present his ideas without once

mentioning justice. The important
factors for revolution are now sim-
ply the correct time, place and at-
tendant circumstances.

“Power Groups” Dominate

Starting with Hegel, the speaker de-
clared. governments have become
identiﬁed by philosophers with “power
groups.” Hegel's notion of a. continu-
ous cosmic process has "been trans-
formed by Marx into the conception of
history as a procession of states ruled
by dominant classes.

Thinking with the blood has replac-
ed reasoning in revolutionary cir-
cles. he continued. The brain may be
called into play, but it is used only to
justify previous opinions.

Hegel was called the ﬁrst to ex-
pound the theory of “whole over part”
in government. The subordination of
the individual. “the newest trend.” is
the feature of modern totalitarian
states, he asserted.

Discussion following the speech
brought on spirited questioning of the
speaker. “I refuse to submit the
ﬁgures in history to a process of psy-
choanalysis.” Dr. Gabbert maintained,
“and I do not feel others can do so
until they can explain ﬁnal causes by
such means."

Auditor Announces Year’s Figures

On Total Income, Scholarship Aids

Do youknow that well over 2,000
students of the University received
scholarship aid last year, that more
than 2,300 students and alumni were
placed in positions, and that 890 un-
dergraduates last year did NYA work?

These ﬁgures are a few samples
from a condensed summary of interest-
ing facts for the ﬁscal year 1934-35,
prepared by G. Stanley Rupp, auditor
of the University, and published in
the current edition of the Pittsburgh
Record.

The ﬁgures reveal that the Univer-
sity operated at a deﬁcit of $4,660 the
last ﬁscal year. Total income was
$2,327,992, to which the greatest con-
tributing factors were the student tui-
tion and state appropriations. Stu-
dents paid in $1,300,024 in tuition, and
the state granted a total of $689,636,
given in two separate appropriations.
Expenses aggrega.ted $2,322,652.

Student enrollment showed a mark-
ed decrease from 1931-32 ﬁgures. In
that ﬁscal year, the number was
15,253, but last term the mark was
11,631. This included 9,541 students
on the campus proper, 871 in the jun-
ior colleges, and 1,219 in extension de-
pa.rtments.

The exact number of students re-

ceiving scholarship aid was 2,203. Of
this number, 134 students received
scholarships which were endowed to
the value of $19,000, while the remain-
ing 2,069 students were awarded free
tuition totaling $303,957. The scholar-
ship grants included those to 585 sen-
atorial appointees, and the remaining
1,484 students had high school scholar-
ships, special scholarships, band al-
lowances, graduate council scholar-
ships, ministers’ allowances, and
partial tuition for members of the fac-
ulty and their families.

The privilege of deferred payment
of tuition was extended to 3,038 stu-
dents the ﬁrst semester and 3,420 the
second, who paid over $500,000 in that
manner. Seventy-six per cent of possi-
ble tuition was collected by the Treas-
urer's office. Of this ﬁgure, 52- per
cent was received at registration pe-
riods a.nd the other 24 per cent through
deferred tuition.

Students and alumni numbering
2,378 were placed during the school
year, 1934-35, and earned almost
$461,000 at t-hose positions. The dean
of men’s office placed 1,981, and the
dean of women’s» office, 397.

The 890 undergraduates doing NYA
work earned a sum of $75,960.

Men’s Glee Club
To Go On Hookup

Beneﬁt Broadcast For Red Cross
Scheduled Thursday Night

Appearing as one of the featured
musical units on a beneﬁt broadcast
for Red Cross funds, the Men’s Glee
Club will sing over a nation-wide
hookup Thursday night sometime be-
tween 11:30 and 12:30 o’clock over
radio station \VCAE.

VVith Dr. Wright directing, the club
will sing four selections, including its
special arrangements of “Hail To
Pitt” and “Alma Mater.” The other
two numbers will be chosen from the
organization’s repertoire of songs.

Although the Easter holidays will
prevent several of the members from
taking their places Thursday night,
Harry Robinson, C36, president of the
club-,-‘—ann-ounc-ed that he expected“ at
least 50 men will be in the studio for
the program.

Tickets for the Home Concert will
go on exchange after the vacation.
Robert Euwer, C36, business manager,
expects to have the ticket stand in op-
eration April 15, 16, and 17. Mem-
bers of the club will be able to get
tickets on Wednesday.

For the concert, which will be held
at the Nixon theater Monday, April
20, Dr. Wright expects to have several
guest artists. One of them will be a
bagpipe soloist who was an undergrad-
uate member of the club. Two of the
org'anization’s numbers this year are
Scottish airs, and this alumnus will
provide native acompaniment for both
of them in addition to the solo efforts.

Another feature of the program on
the 20th will have the alumni club in
a singing role. This newly-formed
choral society is expected to present

‘ two numbers.

Tomorrow afternoon the executive
committee will hold an important
luncheon meeting at Cathedral Man-
sions.

Easter Recess

The Easter recess will extend

from Thursday, April 9, to Tuesday,

April 14, inclusive. The University

offices will be closed on Friday,
April 10. '

Senior Engineering Students
Ponder Over Refrigeration

 

Since early last October, Franklin
Hc-ckensmit-h and Don Hipp, two
seniors in mechanical engineering,
have been much concerned over freez-
ing temperatures. It isn’t the weather
that worries them, but a new type of
refrigerator.

As their thesis, Hockensmith and
Hipp are elaborating upon an idea
given them ‘nv Frank H. -S-tiening, as-
sociate professor of mechanical en-
.2'lIl€el‘l‘lE‘.'. The principle employed in
this unit is to utilize the condensation
of sulfur dioxide which takes place in
the dome of all refrigerators. By do-
ing this, instead of combating it, as
do the present type of refrigerators.
the system eliminates heavy layers of
insulation, heating elements, which
draw a continuous supply of electricity
24 hours a day, and small gas flames.

To carry out this principle. cooling
vanes are soldered to the sides of the
dome. When the sulfur dioxide en-
ters the dome it will condense and,
contrary to present types, the mechan-
ism is arranged to take care of this.
The liquid sulfur dioxide, being
heavier than the mineral oil which lies
in the oil sump in the dome, sinks to
the bottom. When enough of the gas
has condensed and settled in the bot-
tom of the dome, a valve, operated by
a float that floats on sulfur dioxide
but sinks in mineral oil, opens and
permits the sulfur dioxide to complete
the refrigeration cycle.

The construction of the device is
not quite so simple as is the operation
of the refrigerator, for Hockensmith

and Hipp must seal every connection
in the entire system. A single leak
will render the entire machine useless.
To seal the points, solder is used;
if this were to drop into any of the
parts, they would have to ‘be dis-
assembled and the entire process re-
peated. Any kink or obstruction in
the many feet of copper tubing con-
necting the parts will also hamper the
efficiency of the refrigerator so that
the beneﬁts of the new setup are de-
feated.

Mr. Stiening’s idea has been the sub-
ject of two previous theses. Donald
M. Russell and William A. Meyer
worked on the idea in 1934 and David
C. Blrecht and J. Audley Jamison im-
proved upon their machine last year.
However, such difficulties as the cor-
rect volumes of mineral oil and sulfur
dioxide and the correct positions of
the oil and liquid sulfur dioxide in the
dome along with the ever-present
trouble of clogged and kinked lines af-
fected their results. The operation
of the machine did thus not measure
up to expectation.

Because they can proﬁt by the dif-
ﬁculties of former years, Hockensmith
and Hipp believe that their setup of
the refrigerator will be successful.

One of the foremost refrigerators
on the market was developed by stu-
dents working on a thesis in much
the same fashion. This refrigerator,
which utilizes a. small gas flame, show-
ed such performance that the idea was
promoted. and resulted in ﬁnancial
success.

Cap, Gown Opens
Ticket Exchange

Books Taken Today, Tomorrow,
Wednesday In Commons

Students who stood in line on a
rainy day last April will appreciate
the fact that this year’s Cap and Gown
ticket exchange to begin this after-
noon from 3:30 to 6 o'clock, will not
be bothered by the elements. It will
be held in the Commons Room of the
Cathedral, and will continue tomorrow
and Wednesday afternoons at the
same time.

Tickets will be available for any of
the four performances, from Wednes-
day, April 22, to Saturday, April 25,
inclusive. There will be no matinees.
Although Wednesday is oﬁicially G-rad-
uate Night, some student tickets are
available for that performance.

-- For -$1 and —their ‘student-book, stu--

dents can purchase two $2 tickets for
orchestra or ﬁrst balcony. For the stu-
dent ticket, he may obtain two admis-
sions to the gallery or one admission
to the orchestra or ﬁrst balcony. No
exchange tickets will be honored after
the regular hours, or if the ticket has
been torn from the student book.

In order to prevent overcrowding at
the exchange, and for the convenience
of those who are unable to attend to-
day, good tickets will be available to-
morrow.

If couples wish their seats together,
either may present both student books
and receive tickets. Otherwise, stu-
dents must present their books in
person.

Additional tickets can be purchased,
tax-free, at the exchange. Orchestra

tickets and the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of the»

balcony are $2; the next four rows of
the balcony are $1.50; and the last
four rows are $1. Gallery seats are
priced at 50 cents.

G-eisePTo lSpwe_ak
At Final Parents
Council Meeting

The age old mystery of “Why Do
Students Study?” is going to be aired
tomorrow in Room 1309, Cathedral, at
7:45 o’clock by Dr. John J. Geise, as-
sistant professor of history, before the
ﬁnal meeting of the University Pa-
rents Council.

“I hope to discuss the subject from
four viewpoints,” Dr. Geise stated.
“namely, what students do in a produc-
tive way that helps them, what they
do that defeats their purpose, why cer-
tain students are successful, and
what are the most desirable means
and methods of attack on the problem.

"To me,” he continued, “the prob-
lem study attack is as important,
if not more important, than the ac-
cumulation. of facts. I hope by pre-
senting these facts to the parents of
women students in the University to
make them more aware and sympa-
thetic to the problem on hand.”

Dr. Geise’s speech brings to an end
the series of social problems of special
interest to the University Parents
Council.

The Council hopes to present an
equally interesting and varied pro-
gram for next fall when it reconvenes
early in the school term.

Dean Approves Nominees Chosen
From Five Schools; Election

Will Take Place April 17

Nomination of 40 men for election
to the new Men’s Council were an-
nouced today by the dean of men's
office, which, acting as. nominating
committee, made its selection from
the petitions handed in last week.

In the College the following students
were nominated. From the senior
Alexander L. Leggin, Paul F.
Kromer, Charles Rogers, and William
Trosen. Of the juniors there are:
Paul L. Jennings, Robert F. Prince,
and Herbert Rackoff. From the sopho-
more class were nominated: Robert
Culp, G. Leo Griffith, William Hoev-
eler, Michael C. Kelly, VVilliam Kun-
kel, Leonard Levison, J. Spencer Lid-
dell, and Campbell Moses.

From the School of Business Admin-

Phi Epsilon Pi
Wins Scholastic
Award With 1.94

Pi Lams 2nd Among I-F Council
Members; All-Fratemity Mark
Rises .02 Point To 1284

Keeping ﬁrst place in the fraternity
scholarship ratings for its third suc-
cessive semester, Phi Epsilon Pi set a
new all-time high for I-F Council when
it produced a 1.94 quality point point
average for the ﬁrst semester of this
year.

According to ﬁgures released from
the oﬁice of the registrar Friday, this
mark puts Phi Ep far out in front to-
ward retaining the scholarship plaque
for another year. Its nearest I-F Coun-
cil competitor, Pi Lambda Phi, was
.55 points below with a 1.39 average.

Although the all-fraternity average
was almost two points better than the
record for the previous semester, only
live fraternities, four of which are
members of council, were above this-
average. This indicates a complete re-
versal of form, since last year showed
seven out of 15 above the all-fraternity
average.

Sigma Chi, -by dropping below the
minimum average of .90, has been
placed on probation for the coming
semester, under a ruling passed by the
Interfraternity Committee late in 1934.
This is the ﬁrst time this rule has had
to be us-ed. During the probation pe-
riod, the fraternity may have no social
functions, rushing season excepted.
An additional rule states that if a fra-.
ternity does not succeed in raising its
average above .75 after being placed
on probation, it will not be permitted

1935-36 Assembly
Meets For Last
Time Tomorrow

Harvey Laud: Work Of Executive
Committee During Year Filled
VVith Many New Activities

With its ninth and last meeting to
‘be held tomorrow, Student-Faculty As-
sembly will wind up ‘business as it
closes its second year of University
existence.

Called one week early so that it
will not conﬂict with the Easter vaca-
tion, this last -meeting probably will
not be the scene of the ﬁery debates,
the parliamentary arguments, and the
important decisions which have char-
acterized SFA meetings all through the
year.

Beginning with the report of the
committee on committees in Decem-
ber, SFA entered into a long list of
activities which it never before had
touched. More than 20 new commit-
tees were created, with functions
ranging from Sub-Freshman activi-
ties to a senior commencement com-
mittee, from the attempted establish-
ment of a post office, to the setting
up of the Men’s Council.

From then on, meetings were a.
maze, albeit an orderly maze, of com-
mittee reports, ﬁghts for club charters,
and all the activities which made
SFA news during the year.

Routine Business Scheduled

According to William Harvey, C36,
present chairman who will go out of
office after this meeting, a routine
checking up of old business will con-
stitute the major portion of the as-
sembly’s session. Said Harvey: “I
expect to receive co-mplete reports
from all sub-committees Tuesday, so
that I can incorporate them into my
ﬁnal report to be given at the post-
election meeting in May. I shall rec-
ommend to the incoming executive
committee that they continue these
committees with as little change in
personnel as possible. I am quite
pleased with their accomplishments.

“The executive committee,” he con-
tinued, “wa.s particularly ﬁne in its
cooperation. In the nomination of
candidates for the coming ' election,
they completed a tough assignment
especially well. The task of nomina-
tion is one not easily carried out, but
the executive committee, in a fair,
impartial manner, did much better
than I could have expected.

“I am hoping,” he added, “that, next
year's executive committee will do
its work as well as the retiring one
did.”

The next SFA meeting will be held
May 12, when the members to be elect-
ed next Friday assume their offices
and elect their executive committee.
The voting on April 17 will be by
means of registration cards, alone, al-
though a. student may become identi-
ﬁed at the office of the dean of men
or the office» of the dean of women and
may thus become eligible to vote.

YM- YW—C—A Chbinets Plan
Joint Session Wednesday

The cabinets of the YWCA and the
YMCA will have a joint meeting Wed-
nesday at 3:30 o'clock at the Y club
rooms at Forbes and Bouquet Street.
They will consider joint projects for
the coming year.

The Wlorship Services, Public Af-
fairs Institute, and new projects such
as organization of a. cooperative group,
and a peace council will be discussed.

Nona Monks, Ed36, and Edwin
Lincoln. E.d37, will head the meeting.

Tippetts Discusses Federal

l

Spending In Latest ‘Record’

 

“Why All This Government Spend-
ins?” Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Administration,
answers the question in an article of
that name appearing in the regular
quarterly edition of the Pittsburgh
Record. out today. Also included are
articles on government, stream pollu-
tion, literature, and philosophy.

Dr. Tippetts gives a fair appraisal
of the so-called New Deal “extrav-
agance.” “We should all like to see
a balanced budget.” he begins. “The
government cannot keep on spending
at its present rate indeﬁnitely. If it
does. the result will be disastrous."

The fact that there has been too
much extravagance and politics -in
the relief set-up cannot be denied, he
adds. However, he refutes a prevalent
opinion that the majority of people on
relief do not want jobs. “These peo-
ple are.” he explains, “for the most
part. respectable American citizens in
rlifﬁculty through no fault of their
own. and they want work, not char-
ity.”

He continues by reviewing the his-
tory of the past six depression years
during which a national debt of over
30 billion dollars has piled up. In
1932, cities became unable to take
care of the burden of relief, and, as a
result. according to Dr. Tippetts, “the
only way to keep people from starving
was for the national government to
assume the cost.”

In response to the present demand
that relief be turned back to state

and local authorities, the government,
he says, is trying to substitute work
projects for direct relief. He further
points out that if the relief problem
is thrown back to state and local gov-
ernment. higher taxes will result. All
during the depression the public has
clamored for low taxes.

Here Dean Tippetts comes to the
defense of ex-president Herbert. Hoov-
er. He points out that the attempt
to ﬁght the depression by government-
al action began in the administration
of Hoover. In view of this. he con-
siders it strange that he should still
be accused of doing nothing. He com-
pares the present ,crisis with the
VVorld “Tar monetary situation. In
both cases, he declares, money is a
secondary consideration.

The wisdom of paying the soldiers’
bonus this year is questioned by Dr.
Tippetts. “Many of our leading states-
men, who have fought so vigorously
for a balanced budget, voted for the
bonus,” he says. “How anyone who
was anxious to reduce governmental
expenditures could have voted for
that measure, is quite beyond my com-
prehension.”

The AAA ruling does not settle the
question of farm relief in Dr. Tip-
petts’ opinion. A substitute farm pro-
gram, together with the soldiers’
bonus, will add almost three billion
dollars to the national deﬁcit this
year, according to his calculations.

He lists several possible methods of
balancing the budget, such as increas-

Here Comes The Calendar

TUDENT FACULTY ASSEMBLY’S Social Commit-
Stee begins today what writers might cautiously refer
to as a “noble experiment.” The committee plans to
publislr in columns of The News a chronological sum-
mary of campus events immediately pending.

The committee has nothing to lose in the project,
inasmuch as the business of submitting information is
placed up squarely to the various activities. Strictly
speaking, the Military Ball would not ﬁnd a place on
the calendar unless application was duly made. The odds,
of course, will be somewhat against such a tactical error
on the part of the soldiers.

It is only fair to state that the sole connection The
News has with the calendar is in publishing it. Heads
of group activities need not fear that a. mention in the
calendar will give The News cause to omit stories con-
cerning the activity. The reverse, of course, is true.

There is some discussion concerning the including
of times for such affairs as football practice. It is gen-
erally conceded that the gridders have a rough idea .of
the time they are to hie themselves to the practice ﬁeld
for their workouts. The committee contends that pub-
lishing the times of practices will encourage students to
go up and watch the gridders in action. VVe’ll contend
that if publicizing the practice hour brings a few more
ends and husky linemen out to answer Jock Suthe-rland’s
plea for more material, the space will be well invested.

The calendar idea is being tried this spring to learn
whether or not it will prove worthwhile for regular use
next fall.

Heads of the various campus activities are heartily
urged by the calendar committee to submit -the dates
and times of their atfairs, in order to give the experi-
ment every possible chance for success.

Unofficially, it has been claimed that the disband-
ing of the Knitting Club already has dealt the commit-
tee a severe blow.

Maybe They Come Clean .

The SFA at the University of Southern California

proposed a cooperative laundry plan to save money for

students who live away from home but it was rejected

by the fraternities and sororities to which it was ﬁrst

submitted for approval. It is now being put to a vot.e
of the general student body.

VVe’ve Seen Teams Like That

Men got a taste of women’s basketball at Southern
Methodist recently when the varsity cagers met the Del-
ta Psi Kappas, girl athletes. The men had to play under
women’s rules. The girls, evidently fearing that the men
could still wallop them, forced their opponents to wear
boxing gloves during the game.

Well, You Guess
To complete the idea of the Veterans of Future Wars
and the Gold Star Mothers of Future Wars as formed in
some schools recently, the students at Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute, Troy, N. Y., formed the Proﬁteers of
Future Wars. Membership in the group is limited to

those who, upon “passing” a free medical examination, -

have “ﬂat feet, astigmatism, partial deafness or other
disability exempting them from military service.”

In an oflicial statement of policy, the group said that
it would “lobby” for immediate payment of proﬁts to be
obtained from contracts still to be let for war supplies
and would campaign vigorously against payment of
bonuses.

Business Good, Says Bureau

Business in the Pittsburgh district
is rapidly recovering from the paraly-
sis caused by the flood, announced
the Bureau of Business Research, with
the arljusted index of business show-
ing that 11 of the 28 points which the
index dropped during flood week had
been recovered.

In fact, stated the :7ureau report,
“1_.ar_'-qe gains were made by nearly all
lines of activity for the week ended
March 28.” The extent of the improve-
ment in industrial operations is in-
dicated by the sharp rise in the steel
mill activity. The index of steel mill
operations was nearly 64 per cent of
normal for the week ended March 28,
whereas in the week of the ﬂood it
was 50 per cent of normal.

Wide gains were also reported in
both rail and river traffic while the
index of ori;'inatir.<_r shipments showed
:1 gain of 19.3 points over that of ﬂood
week. Coal production advanced from
approximately 43 per cent of normal
to 71.0 per cent.

The index of trade differed in that
i‘ showed only a slight increase, niero
ly  points over that of ﬂood week.
The small gain in this index is explain-
ed by the fact that several of the de-
pnrtiuent stores in Pittsburgh were
closed for the entire week ended
March 28. In the ﬂood week all of
them operated at least two (lays and
a few were open most of the week.
it should he remembered that many
of the stores which were not in the
f‘oor.l area will probably show business
increases.

As an adder‘. fact. the Bureau notes
that trade and industry were almost
at 21 standstill and little freight was
moved either by rail or by water for
‘l?:1l‘t of the week. Yet the index was
hi_9'l~.e.r. except for one week, than it
was for any tinie from the be.<4‘inninc~

Sobkoviak, Army Ojﬁcer,

Takes ROTC Orders Now

By Al Kairys

Joseph Sobkoviak, sergeant in the
United States army, is the Pitt ROTC
lad who ﬁnds himself in this odd po-
sition. Joe, a crack shot on the riﬂe
team, recently stepped into the spot-
ll_Sl‘l1t by baiigiiig out a perfect 3.00
scholastic average.

The Sobkoviak family moved to P0-
land while Joe was still wearing short
pants in a small town somewhere in
Washington State. It was in Poland
that he ﬁnished his preliminary and
high school education. Finding life
dull and uninteresting in the simple
country existence, Joe crossed ihe At-
.antic to look for new worlds of ad-
venture.

Upon his arrival, he enlisted in the

army at the nearest recruiting oﬂice.
Although he had never handled a riﬂe
before, Joe‘ soon . became proﬁcient
enough in its use to warrant the rat-
ing of an expert, in which capacity he
coached others in the art of shooting.
One day he was surprised by being of-
fered a commission as sergeant. He
accepted.

His career in the army was tempor-
arily halted when he decided to enroll
at Pitt. Joe is studying electrical en-
gineering and hesitatingly admits that
he is only a. sophomore in Dean Hol-
brook’s school. At the present time,
he is taking a. correspondence course
in the officers’ school of the National
Guard, which he expects to ﬁnish
some time in May.

"Joe Gets into Activities

Joe by no means conﬁnes his activi-
ties to the text books. He is known
to the band boys as assistant manager
and also barks out comina.nds in the
Logan Armory every Wednesday and
Friday afternoon as ﬁrst lieutenant in
the Pitt Riﬂes.
Military Department several times a
week in an NYA capacity, and enjoys
the work.

Last semester, Sobkoviak received
the Gold Medal from Colonel Hol-
combe for general excellence in the
basic course of military science.
Sigma Tau, national honorary engi-
neering fraternity, also honored him
with a bronze medal for his accom-
plishments in other subjects.

Most of the “little colonel’s” spare
time is spent in playing chess with
anybody who understands the game or
in cutting corners on the ice at Du-
quesne Garden. He would like to
write of his experiences in the army,
but ﬁnds no time.

More than anything else, Sobkoviak
hopes for a successful career in the
engineering business.

Trustees Approve
Scholarship Grant

Phi Epsilon Pi Award Aids Jewish

Students In German Schools

Acting upon the recommendation of
Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity, the Board
of Trustees of the University has
granted a full one-year scholarship to
Max Katz, a student at present in the
»Un.iver'sity at Frankfortam-Mainz,
Germany.

Katz is being brought to the Uni-
versity as a result of a resolution pass-
ed by Phi Epsilon Pi at its national
convention in Pittsburgh, last Janu-
ary. The fraternity agreed to aid in
permitting Jewish students in Ger-
man schools to continue their educa-
tion in the United States.

Katz, 2. student in industrial chemis-
try, lives at Friedberg-Hesse, Ger-
many, and in addition to his study in
Fran}-tfort, spent a. summer at a Uni-
versity in the north of France. He
speaks German. French, and Eiigllsh
with equal facility. and has been a
teacher of English in Germany.

Upon reading about Phi Epsilon
Pi’s action, he immediately contacted
Sidney Friedman, past superior of the
‘local chapter, and after approval of
the membership, Katz’s name was sub-
mitted to the Board of Trustees for a
scholarship consideration.

It Katz. as is likely, accepts the
scholarship offer from the University,
‘=‘«e will make his home next year at
the local Phi Ep house.

Clash Tomorrow For Title

 

Second Consecutive Interfrat Basketball Crown Appears
For Kappa Sigma Passers In Stadium Game

By Leonard Levison

Temporarily shoving outdo

or activity from the sportlight,

basketball comes back for another encore tomorrow night when
the Kappa Sigma quintuplets mix it up with the boys from across

Dithridge Street, Phi Delta Thet

a at 8 o’clock at the Stadium. It

will be no neighborly get-together, for to the winner goes the In-
terfraternity basketball championship.

Defending champions, Kappa Sigma?

has another blue ribbon outﬁt this
3c-ar. As a matter of fact with one
exception, it is th-e‘same team that
grabbed the mug last year. That one
exception is Johnny Wood, who has
been the big bertha this season in the
Kappa -Sigma scoring artillery.

On the other side of the street, the
Phi Delts have also got what it takes
to win basketball titles. Theirs is a
well-seasoned team, fast passing, fast
moving, and first in League B.

Records, while they reveal the abil-
ity of both aggregations, do not indi-
cate the supremacy of either. Both
mowed down the opposition with
steam-roller effectiveness.

Boast Good Records

Kappa Sigma stampeded its way to
the league toga with ﬁve straight wins.
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi,
Phi Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Chi
fell beneath the Kappa Sigs. Packed
away in the red and white dynamo
was the juice that sparked the Kappa
Sigs to a point-and—a-halt-a-minute to-
tal for the seasons average.

Phi Delta Theta cleared every hur-
dle with points to spare. Phi Gamma
Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda
Phi, Sigma Alpha Mu, and last, but
least only in margin of victory was
Delta Tau Delta. This last contest in
which the Phi Delts downed last
;»‘ea.r’s league winners was the hottest
game of the year. It took them three
overtime periods to squelch the Delts’
lighting attempt to even things up.

Football Players Standout

Another similarity is found in the
personnel of both lineups, with foot-
ballers predominating. The Kappa
Sigs, have in addition to Wood, sopho-‘
more gridmen Delich and Hensley as!
their basketball bulwarks. For the‘
Phi Delts, burly varsity guard, Biff
Glassford is flanked by promising
freshman center Dannies, and all-fra-
ternity touch-gridder Grosscope.

And then, too, there are plenty of
good ﬂoormen. Rounding out the
Kappa Sig combination are Bud Beach-
ler and Marty Groat, all-fraternity bas-
ketball men last year. Sam Anderson
and Roy Heckler, all-fraternity pass-
ers for the last three years, complete
the Phi Delt roster. ~

Tennis Teams To Start
Workouts This Week

Just as soon as \Veatherman Brotz-
man wears one or_ his usual spring
weather smiles, the Panther tennis
squad will get down to work in prep-
aration for its opening match, that
with Carnegie Tech on April 18.

From that date, the Golden Cat net
team will be a very busy team until
the last day of school with their 12-
game schedule. Six schools have been
carded for single match dates, while
three college outﬁts will be met on
the home-and-home basis.

Tech, Bethany, and Grove City are
the teams that the Panthers will look
twice at from different courses. W’. & J,
I\’av)’, Western Reserve, Penn State,
Geoge VVashington, and Georgetown
will be played only once. During the
season, the Panthers will appear in
Grove City, Cleveland, Annapolis,
V\='ashington, D. C., Bethany, and over
at Tech in the away-series.

All freshman and varsity candidates
for the tennis team will report to
nianager Eugene Cohen, C36, at the
Stadium office at 2:30 o’clock this
afternoon to ﬁle eligibility cards.

Handicap Events

Annual Outdoor Event Scheduled
For Stadium Track Saturday

Now that the two-week lull between
the indoor and outdoor seasons has
passed, Coach Olson again reassem-
bles his freshman and varsity squads
to prepare for the opening event of the
outdoor campaign, the third annual
handicap championships, Saturday.

No less than nine tests have been
scheduled for a Panther varsity that
promises to go as far as any track
team in Pitt history. On the week-
end following the annual handicaps,
the Olsonmen invade Owl territory at
Philadelphia in a dual warm-up for
the Penn Relays, April 25.

No handicaps for Saturday’s con-
tests have been determined, but the
coaching department plans to an-
nounce these later in the week. In
last year’s running, the distances for
the least inexperienced varied from
300 yards in the mile run to 10 yards
in the 10-0. The best performers start

Thomas Looks Good

The Pitt squad looks plenty strong
in the middle-distance events with
perhaps Art Thomas, specialist in the
quarter mile, in the best position to
dominate the ﬁeld. Charley Great and
Harold Connelly, both record holders

|in the half mile, have been taking it

relatively easy all during the indoor
drills, but will likely turn on the steam
once they get the feel of the stadium
cinders.

oath McConnell, quarter and half
miler, has great possibilities, accord-
ing to Coach Olson, and would really
become a great runner if he gets the
correct incentive. Red Tost, who has
run consistently in the low 4:30’s dur-
ing the indoor season, will be a high
point-getter in the mile and two-mile
events.

Alex Leggin, Franklyn Theriault,
and George Cook appear to be in the
best shape to take care of the two-
mile assignments. Andy Lasky, Mike
Sowiski, and Walter Good are the only
hurdleijs of note, but these .three gen-
tlemen are expected to give a good
account of themselves before the sea-
son moves into the late championship
stages.

Pete Bennett and Redmond Oden
represent the ﬁnest higli-jumping pros-
pects the Pitt team has been able to
show in many seasons. Bennett al-
ready has annexed the indoor title,

Panther Golfers Open

With the battle for positions still
being waged, Art Snyder, Pitt golﬁng
coach, is scanning scoreboards and
keeping a sharp eye on the Panther
fairway aspirants. By Saturday he
will have to select the four talented
niblick-wielders who will comprise

for the first competitive tee-off of the

He still spells it with an “o,” but he is never too busy to

The vocal “o” came when Connelly cracked the tape in the

Pitt had to win the relay to take the title, for if the Ram-

Pitt Freshman Cagers Close Successful

S_e_as_on With 14 Victories, One Setback

Little Mountaineer Five!
Hands Yearlings
Only Defeat

By William K. Trosen

Holding up the tradition of consist-
ently good Panther freshman basket-
ball teams, the 1935-36 cage team, set-
ting up another record in games won
and lost. closed their best season when
they walloped the Mountaineer frosh
down in Morgantown a few weeks ago.

When all the games had been add-
ed up, only one had to be subtracted
from the total of 15 to be charged de-
feat, with the remaining 14 going into
the records as victories. Last season
the Little Panthers set a record when
they took 15 of 18 games played.

It was Docky Kowallis’ second year
as freshman cage coach and for the
second time he proved his right to the
job. In his two-year reign Kowallis
shows an “all-time” standing of 29 tri-
umphs and only four losses.

Take Five Straight

The Panther frosh started the sea-
son with the idea to knock the cars
off all their scheduled opponents. For
five games they seemed to stick to
that idea, kicking out triumphs over
the \V&J, Tech, Lenox Junior Col-
lege, Kiski, and Penn State frosh
teams. »

And then the tough West Virginia
freshies came up from Morgantown
and handed’ out the ﬁrst and only de-
feat to the Pitt boys. Defeat puts it
mildly, for the Mountaineers were
“on” that night and shellacked the K0-
wallis gang, 51-35.

From here until the end of the sea-
son, the Panthers put on the steam
and cruised right through nine
straight games. Duquesne, Central
High, East Pittsburgh High, Duquesne
again, Kis-kl, Tech, Scott High, Brad-
dock High, and the West Virginia
frosh shared the nine'whippings—.

It was the last game of the season,
that with West Virginia, that found
the Baby Panthers at their best and at
the climax of the season. When the
teams ﬁrst met in Pittsburgh, the
Mountaineer five were 16 points bet-
ter than the Panthers. In Morgantown,
however, the second meeting had the
Panthers dealing. out a 23-point defeat
to the West Virginians.

Average Point-a-Minute

In the total points, the Panthers
gathered 588 in 576 playing minutes
compared to their opponents’ 389 total,
thus averaging over a point a minute.
The average score would ﬁnd the Pan-
thers with 39, their opponent with 26.

Coach Docky Kowallis used two
main starting lineups during the sea-
son, one the ﬁrst semester and a
slightly changed one the second half
At the beginning of the
season Kowallis relied upon Jack
Scott and John Smith as forwards, Joe
Fabel at the center, and Ed Sobehart
and George Lindsay at the guard po-
sitions.

Forced to alter this lineup the sec-
ond semester, Kowallis changed the

Receives Models

Of Table, Ch ail:-is‘

'l.‘hrough the cooperation of Mr. Rao-

Lithuanian Room.

included in the group is a seminar
table, a chair for the professor, a stu-
dent's chair. a carved oak candela-
brum. a ceiling lamp rosette, and a
portion of the room cornice.

Carved designs on table and arm-
chairs are taken from the carvings
on the spindle of an ancient hand loom
now in the Cuirlionies Museum in;
Kaunas, Lithuania. 

The Lithuanian Room will be uniquef
:am-ong the nationality rooms. Hand-Q
woven linen, serenely gray in tone.

Delayed A Month,
But: Still Green

VVhereas the Emerald Luncheon
for junior women was scheduled

therefore let it be resolved that the
date has been changed to April 17.

Coming out from under the cover
of that legal language, it will be
noted that the junior women have
changed their annual event, held near
St. Patrick’s day, in which the W0-
men of the junior class throw off
their American customs and become
Irish for an hour.

Although it will be slightly un-
timely this year, the idea is still there,
and the juniors will be trekking up to

Commission Discusses Possibility
Of $10 Student Assessment

 

The possibility of having a ten dol-

9 lar student activity fee added to tui-

tion fees was discussed at the VVSGA
Commission meeting Thursday night.
This fee would be paid by each stu-
dent at registration and would be used
for the sponsoring of all student ac-
tivities.

The suggested plan would increase

the appropriation for activities at least‘

two-fold. Furthermore, it would give
organizations a chance to do construc-
tive work rather than spending time
considering money-making proposi-
tions. One of the alleged beneﬁts un-
der the plan would be the eradication
of rcniunerative activity positions in
student organizations.

The plan would make it possible to
distribute all student publications free
of charge.

A lengthy discussion ensued from
the suggestion of this plan during
which many points were brought up.
Would it be too much of an economic
burden? VVhat will non-activity stu-
dents think of the plan‘?

Since Thursday"s meeting was the
last of the current school year, a. rec-
ommendation was made that the new
commission further investigate the
possibilities of instituting such a plan.

Am0I1f.%‘ other business, several
minor constitutional changes were
Dassed to be voted on at the mass
meeting of VVSGA which will open
Leaders’ Institute. ‘

Institute Widens
Annual Program

New Ofﬁcers To Be Given Actual

Training For Coming Duties

 

The Leaders Institute this year will
be radically different from any in the
history of the tradition. The funda-
mental plan is to give elected leaders
actual trainintq in their duties for the
coming year. Therefore, the enroll-
ment will be limited to women who
have been elected to offices in the
SI.l1’ln.‘l‘ election. Attendance for them
will be compulsory.

Instead of a one-day affair, this
year’s session will be one and a half
days: Thursday. April 23, and the
morning of Friday, April 24.

The Institute will be opened and
closed by VVSGA. The opening will
he a general mass meeting of WSC-.r\
for the purpose of voting on several
proposed amendments to the constitu-

,tion. and the closing will be the in-

wtnlliation of the newly elected WSC.
ol't'icers and commission.

Included on the program will be a
“acuity symposium, group meetings for
the women elected to each office,
general meetings, and a guest speaker
or artist. Senior activity leaders
and members of the faculty will be
in charge of the various group meet-
1112s.

As an added feature of the Institute.
the dean of women's ofﬁce is giving
--1 luncheon for all in attendance on
Thursday.

The plans, to he released at a later
date, forecast one of the most interest-
ing Institutes in the history of the
L'\'€Ilt.

The committee. led by Mary Fran-
c-cs Brice, l“.(l3(). includes Betty Black,
C36: Leah Hirsch, C38: Martha Fuller,

‘Sleeping Beauty’
Will Have Music
Of Tsclwikowslsty

History of a ballet in one sentence:

Tschaikowsky wrote the music, but
Miss Elizabeth Rearick made up the
dances.

That's the way, at least, that the
Sleeping Beauty ballet came into be-
ing. And the vocal arrangement,
which the W'on1en’s Choral, co-pro-
ducers with W'AA of the ballet, will
sing, was written by Franz Born-

 

The choral will form a constant
background, a11d the women's chorus
of dancers will be on the stage most
of the time. This ballet takes the
place of the home concert program
for the Choral. It will be given on
May 8.

The cast for the ballet includes:
June Greene. C38, who has the leading
dancing part; Marjorie Noah, C38, as
the Flower Fay; ltuth Anderson,
Ed3G, as the Witch; Loretta Mc-
Elwee, Ed36, as Puss in Boots; Mary
Jo Kunkel, Ed37, as the \-Vhite Lady
Cat; and Peggy Donley, (.39, as the
Prince.

Miss Anderson is the only dancer
to make up her own dance, although
the rest of the cast aided Miss Rearick,
assistant professor of physical educa-
tion, in her composition.

The court attendants are: Betty
Adams, C39; Louise Baughman, C38;

Tippetts Analyzes
N ation’s Spending

(Continued from Page One)
in‘: income tax rates. sales taxes, or
cutting government expenditures. Thr
first two methods, he explains, are un-
popular, while cutting down expendi-
tures might not be the best thing tr
do. inasmuch as it widely believed
that a large part of our past recovery
has been due to government spending.

He notes that business men attri-
bute business recovery to two phases

 

of the New Dea1—AAA and govern-
ment spendiirz. “How long govern-
ment spending must continue will de-

pend largely on how rapidly business
recovers.” he writes.

He believes that we can avoid a
bad inflation, but that the continued
passage of measures, such as the

Another article by Elmer A. Hol-
brook. dean of the School of Engineer-
ing". deals with the problem of pollu-
tion of Pittsburgh rivers. Although
the pollution is caused by dumping of
sewage and mine and factory acid, he
says that the chief source of trouble
is that virtually none of the cities on
the three rivers has a sewage treat-
ment plant. He urges the building
of such plants. “The rivers,” he
declares, “will never -be puriﬁed until
Western Pennsylvania acts as a unit
in handling the problem.”

In the ﬁeld of philosophy, Dr.
Richard Hope, associate professor of
philosophy, emphasizes that “the con-
tribution of the enterprise of philos-
ophy is essential to a liberal educa-
tion in the best sense of the term.”

Frederick P. Mayer, associate pro-
fessor of English, writes in an article
entitled “A New Idealism," that we
are nearing the end of the realistic
cycle in literature- and approaching
the idealistic.

A summary of the interesting facts
of the ﬁscal year is presented by G.
Stanley Rupp, auditor of the Univer-
sity, in an additional feature of the
magazine.
