Thanksgiving robbery
repeats in Holland Hall

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Holland Hall residents returning from their holiday had , ‘
little to give thanks for when they found their rooms had
been burglarized in a crime which almost exactly resem-
bled last year’s Thanksgiving break-in.

The same four rooms on the second floor of Holland
Hall have been burglarized during the last two
Thanksgiving breaks by someone believed to have a

master key.

Like last year, the doors of three of the rooms were
locked when students returned, proving the burglar had
a key since the doors could not have been re—locked
without one, according to Suzanne Shontz, whose room

was broken into.

The resident hall director, resident assistants and other
employees have access to these keys, according to cam-

pus police.

“We’re looking for an internal person,” Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary Moses said.

Faculty Assembly creates
anti-discrimination statement

By Pete Kapustynski

Asst. "News‘Editor

The preliminary version of
Pitt’s new anti-discrimina-
tion statement was dis-
cussed at a Faculty
Assembly meeting on
Tuesday. This tentative ver-
sion is being circulated to
allow comments to be sub-
mitted on it.

. It states:

“No university employee,
university‘ student or indi-
vidual on university proper-
ty may intentionally harass
or abuse a person physically
or verbally with the purpose
or effect of unreasonably
interfering with such per-
son’s work or academic per-
formance or of creating an
intimidating, hostile or

‘ intensive work or academic

environment, if the conduct
is based on the race, color,
religion, national origin,
ancestry, sex, age, marital
status, familial status, sexual
orientation, disability or sta-
tus as a disabled veteran or
a veteran of the Vietnam
era.”

An example of the
changes discussed was the
dropping of the word
“unreasonable,” because any
interference should be con-
sidered unreasonable.

Other issues discussed at

the assembly included:
-An updated report on con-
struction activities for
Project Jump Start was given
by the Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee Chair
Professor Thomas Anderson.

Administrators answer students’ questions at open forum

By Frank Porco
Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt students had the chance to get things
off their chests at an open forum yesterday
in the Wﬂharn Pitt Union Ballroom.

The forum, sponsored by the Student
Government Board, featured Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor, Provost
Donald Henderson, Senior Vice Chancellor
Ben Tuchi, Assistant Vice Chancellor John
DeVitto and Athletic Director Oval Jaynes.

The idea of the forum was to give Pitt
students a chance to voice their concerns
with the leaders of the university, but not
many students showed up.

“It has been here for the students. It has
been advertised, it’s a chance for them
[O’Connor, Henderson, Tuchi, DeVitto and

Jaynesl to have a more direct consultation
with students,” said Joe Foner, SGB mem-
ber-elect. ,

“Everyone bitches about how things are
going, and this is their chance to do some-
thing,” Foner said. He continued by saying
that if students do not show up, then that
is their loss.

Despite the poor turnout, many ques-
tions were posed to the panel, among

them were some on Mt. Graham and.

where the university stood on that situa-
tion. Mt. Graham is located in Arizona and
has been chosen as the sight of a new and
powerful telescope, being built by the
University of Arizona. Pitt has been asked
to contribute money to the telescope.
O’Connor did not have much information
to disclose on it, but he said he will be

travelling out to the site this. week to look
at it. Until then he said that no decisions
could be made, but that it still was a very
live issue.

Many questions were posed toward
Jaynes about the search for a new football
coach since the resignation of former head
coach Paul Hackett.

Jaynes said that a screening committee,
made- up of alumni and staff, has been
established to ﬁnd a new football coach.

He said that no students make up the
committee due to the lack of time left and
final examinations approaching.

“Just because there is a lack of student
representatives on the committee doesn’t
mean we don’t want response from them,”
Jaynes said. —

Another question was raised about start-

ing an environmental studies major.
Henderson said that there had been work
done on certificates for environmental
studies, and there will be a possible move
toward a major in that ﬁeld of study.

Lastly, the growth at the university was
addressed. O’Connor said last year’s appli-
cations for admittance were up some 36
percent and this year that applications
were up another 40 percent.

“We have to be selective. It’s obvious
that people are looking at Pitt as a school
to attend,” he said.

Chancellor O’Connor said that he was
there to get acquainted with some of the
students and find out what problems they
had. i

“I’m here to find out what’s on your
mind more than anything else,” he said.

the only thing many_students do to protect themselves against HIV
is choose sexual partners more carefully than they did before.

A 19-Campus study conducted by Richard Keeling, chairman of
the American College Health Association’s AIDS Task Force, tested
nearly 17,000 blood samples for the AIDS virus. The results con-
ﬁrmed previous ﬁndings; two students in every 1,000 were infected
with the virus. I

Keeling concluded that a 15,000-student campus could expect to
have one student with AIDS, two to seven with various AIDS-relat-
ed symptoms and 28 to 35 infected with HIV. On 10 of the 19 cam-
puses no infections were found, while five campuses had infection
rates of ﬁve per 1,000 or above. The highest rate, according to the
study, was nine per 1,000.

These findings are important because amajority of college-age
people infected with HIV don’t have AIDS-related symptoms. They
can, however, still transmit the virus to others during unprotected
sexual intercourse or by sharing intravenous needles.

It is this window of opportunity that allows the virus to spread.
For example, the rate of AIDS and STD cases at Pitt has not
increased in the last year. It has not decreased either. This means
there is no change in behavior on campus. “The students [at~Pitt]
score very high on knowledge of AIDS, so they know; but they’re

- not changing their behavior,” Miller said.
Experts agree that education is the key to stopping the rapid‘

spread of AIDS. Miller stressed that the best educational tools are
one-on-one counseling and peer counseling groups. “You have to
get people into it; and I think peers have the biggest impact on stu-
dents,” she said. ,

Pitt’s peer counseling group, “Sexual Aides,” gives basic facts and
emphasizes behavior changes — what words you say, how you say.
them and knowing where you’re going if you’re going to drink.
The idea is to get students to start thinking of AIDS in terms of
“risky acts” rather than “risk groups.”

“People have the ability and the power to stop the infection, and
it’s within them. They can use their own power, think about it and
know what they’re doing,” Miller said. ‘ “

Burglary

glarized told her that the
Housing Office did not
have the locks changed
after last year’s break—in.

“We told Linda Perkins [in
the Housing Office] about
the burglaries last year, and
she was not very helpful at
all,”_Shontz said.

“She kept saying that our
information could be inac-
curate,” she said.

The locks have been
changed since this weekend
but Schontz said the floor

residents still do not feel

safe since someone was
able to gain access to a
master key.

Among the stolen items
were a word processor, a
Sony Discman and a com-
pact disk player, campus

V police said.
Although the Office of,

Residence Life had desk
attendants remain on duty
during the break in order to
tighten security, at least five
rooms in the entire building
were burglarized.

“What happened this year
over the break which was
different than previous
Thanksgiving breaks was
that there were desk atten-
dants working in all the
buildings so the security
procedures were exactly the

same as they are the rest of

the time,” Assistant Director _

of Residence Life Jon
Conlogue said.

“It used to be that the
desk attendants were not
working and that the out-
side locks were changed
and keyed so ‘that students’
room keys only would open
those doors,” he said. “But
that was changed because
we wanted to provide
increased security.”

To get into the building,
students must show the
desk attendant a student ID
with the appropriate build-
ing sticker or be escorted in
by a resident.

Demonstration

AIDS  Fantin said.

Fantin said art galleries are
dimming their lights in a lot of
cities. “It is a day without art,” he
said.

“I don't think that there is
enough [media] coverage. There
is some media coverage but not
enough. The only thing that I
really heard was from MTV,”
Fantin said.

MTV and PBS had “6O seconds
of silence at 8 p.m.,” Fantin ‘said.
“They are not airing. at all,” to
commemorate AIDS Awareness
Day.

Ray Ricketts, a University of

"Pittsburgh student who has been

diagnosed HIV positive, was the
first of those scheduled to speak.
“We are mouming people who
died from AIDS, who died from
governmental neglect, societal
neglect,” ‘Ricketts said. “We are
mourning bigotry‘ and ignorance

and apathy.”

Laura Johnston, a registered
nurse at the University of
Pittsburgh Student Health Service,

' read from a personal essay that

she composed.

According to Johnston, the
number of women who _have
been diagnosed with HIV and
AIDS is small, but should not be
ignored.

“They [the society] tell me les-
bians can’t get AIDS,” Johnston
said. »

‘ Johnston said that she will con-

tinue to hand out condoms and
rubber gloves to educate every-
one, including women.

Lincoln Lowery, who .has also _

been diagnosed HIV positive,
said, “We are not taking HIV sen‘-
ous enough. There is one AIDS
death every seven minutes. Two
million, seven hundred thousand
people have developed full
blown AIDS, of those, 2.5 [mil-

lion] have died.”

Lowery also addressed the
inadequate funding and testing
sites for the AIDS virus.

“In this county no anonymous
[testing] sites are available. The
catastrophe will continue to
snowball year after year. I know
what it’s like to live with HIV. I
would like to preventmore suf-
fering,” Lowery said. 4

Donald Ainslie, the final speak-
er, spoke of the need for “realis-
tic education to teenagers 
about safe sex and self-esteem.”

“World AIDS Day is a -time to
pause-and think of what’s hap-
pened in the last year. Funding
has been cut although [AIDS]
cases have increased,” Ainslie
said. ‘

' , “Keep on acting up. Act up,

fight back, ﬁght AIDS.”

The gathering roared into an
ovation, and then, just as quietly
as it came, it dispersed.

Movin' on

Close the books, shut the door and turn off the
light. The high and mighty U.S. Supreme Court, once
and for all, put an end to all of the controversy over
where it stands on . abortion. The only problem here
is that neither of those whom it affects the most —
pro-lifers and pro-choicers — is going to be happy.

Two days ago, the court made. very clear what it
meant when it reaffirmed the constitutional right to
an abortion in the Planned Parenthood vs. Casey
case. By refusing to hear an appeal which ruled
Guam’s (as a territory of the United States, Guam falls
under the jurisdiction of U.S. laws) broad prohibition
unconstitutional, the Supreme Court said once and

_ for allthat the abortion matter has been settled.

While states may still regulate abortion, they cannot

A outlaw it until the pregnancy reaches the fetal stage.

The last several abortion cases that the Supreme
Court has heard have served to clarify the court’s
position on Roe vs. Wade — a position that goes
against the conservative reputation of the Court. It
has reaffirmed the main idea in Roe vs. Wade that
abortion is a constitutional right.

For the first time in 20'years the ‘Supreme Court is

‘ not going to hear a case about abortion. While this

does not mean the debates about abortion will cease,
it emphasizes the court’s belief in the right of a
woman to be able to have an abortion. The court did
rule in Casey that certain restrictions do apply, but

;even we do not think these limitations are entirely

unfounded. Parental notification for those under 18
and a 24-hour waiting period were ruled constitution-
al in the Casey case. ‘

I This decision, or lack thereof, on the Guam case

i shows a court» willing to compromise onthe subject
of abortion — something that neither extreme on the

abortion debate would do. The fact that neither
extreme is happy is probably the best evidence that
this opinion is a fair one. .

By falling somewhere in ‘between the two extremes,
the court has shown itself to be far more moderate

‘ than expected. This is a pleasant surprise because
‘some of the Reagan court appointees have shown

themselves to be exactly what they are supposed to
be. They didn’t follow the mandates of the Executive
Branch or of Congress and become a legislative tool,
but, at least in this case, they have interpreted the
law without political bias.

Ultimately, what the court has said is that we’ve
made our decision and it’s time to move on. The
rights of women have been_reaffirmed and their con-

" stitutionality upheld. And while Casey may have

slightly gutted Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court has
made its decision. We agree with the court; it is time
to move on. ' '

Racism is a nondiscriminatory term

There is a plague sweeping the
land threatening to smother the
Democratic principles our nation
was founded on. It is every-
where; worming its way through
the fabric of society and under-
mining our ideals of social equal-
ity. No level of society remains
untouched,‘-from individuals to
government, as this insidious dis-
ease goes unchecked. There
seems tobe no cure_ for this
plague that threatens our society.
The plague I speak of is racism,
and it is one of the most serious
problems facing our society.

But what is racism? The
American Heritage Dictionary

‘ deﬁnes racism as “the belief that

some races are inherently better
than others.” These beliefs lead
to discrimination against racial
groups considered to be “inferi-

or.” But in the United States,

racism is almost always used to
refer to the prejudices which
some (not all) whites have
against ‘minorities. This is
because of our unfortunate histo-

.ry of persecution and enslave-

ment of many racial groups at
the hands of European settlers.
Many would argue that these vio-
lent acts forever brand the
descendants of those settlers as
racists or worse.

This skewed view of racism is,

dangerous and must be eliminat-
ed. Variations of racist thought
have existed since the beginning
of time. and exist to one degree
or another in almost every soci-
ety in the world. What causes
racism is difficult to say.
Whatever its origin, this racial
hatred can be seen in various
forms all over the world. Racism
is not exclusive to any one
group. ‘

While the amount of racial
hostility directed against minori-
ties by whites is alarming, it must
be remembered that racism is a
two-way street. The racial con-
flicts in America are not just
whites against minorities, but also
minorities against minorities and
minorities against whites. No
racial group is immune to feeling
hatred toward another. The vio-

    

Mike
Brittingham

. lence we see in the inner cities is

not always divided along racial
lines. It is often one minority
against another or the same racial
group against itself. Violence and
hatred know no racial bound-
aries, and a one—dimensional
View of the problem can only
serve to hinder us in ﬁghting it.

Accepting this View of the
complexity of the issue, how
then can we find a cure? Twenty
or 30 years ago we seemed to be
on the threshold of such a dis-
covery. With the Civil Rights leg-
islation of the 1960s and the hard
work of peace-loving people like
Martin Luther King ]r., we
seemed about to embark on a
journey toward greater equality
and an end to the racial bigotry
of the past. But that dream faded
temporarily, and we must now
decide whether to go forward to
a brighter future or backward to
the darkness of the past. Should
we decide to move forward, we
must do so together, not as
whites or blacks, Hispanics or
Asians, but as Americans.
Otherwise, the Great American
Melting Pot will break apart and
all the king’s horses and all the
king’s men may not be able to
put our nation together again.

To move forward we needtwo
things: unity and order. Unity
was the first casualty of racism,
as both whites and minorities
have become more ethnocentric.

Whether it’s been the growing
cultural movement within the
black community or the growing
bigotry of the white supremacists,
our society is becoming more
and more polarized.

Our unity as a nation must be
rebuilt on the basis of equality. It
is important that all sides sup-
press their ethnocentric tenden-
cies. Pride in one’s own culture is
good, but to carry this to
extremes at the expense of our
nation can only bring chaos.

Order was the second casualty
of this scourge as we saw the
dark forces of racism unleashed
during the L.A. riots. They may
have originated with the intense
anger and frustration felt after
that now-infamous verdict, but
they ended with the destruction
of homes and businesses of inno-
cent people.

Billions of dollars in damage,
caused by people more con-
cerned with looting than with the
trial, did nothing to help end
racism. The hatred goes on.
Though there are many people
who would disagree with me,
violence solves nothing. As one
of my high school teachers used
to say — “disagree without being
disagreeable.” That is what the
people of this nation must learn
to do. Only through order can
we achieve equality. Without
peace there can be no justice.

Order and unity must be the
banners we carry in our fight
against racism. As we grow clos-
er together, we may find that we
are not quite as different as we
once seemed.

Perhaps in doing so we will
gain a greater understanding of
not only other cultures but ‘our
own as well. And in this under-
standing lies the cure for the
plague of racism. As the barriers
between cultures come down
and the younger generations are
“immunized” against the effects
of the disease by more open

interaction, racism will wither ‘

and die. And perhaps one day
this land will trulybe “one
nation, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.” -

Military not quite ready yet

Sheath your swords of irrationality,
holster your sidearms of self-righteous-
ness. Lose the aura of idealism and don
the cap of reality. The reality to which I
refer is that now is not the time to
admit professed homosexuals into the
U.S. military. Not now, not ever.

In order to understand the necessity
for a ban on homosexuals in the mili-
tary, we must first lay aside all idealistic

' and unrealistic notions of the sexual

harmony and acceptance? of alternative
lifestyles some would encourage you to
believe exist in our nation. While a tiny
minority‘ of people in this country see
homosexual acts as acceptable, the vast
majority is repulsed by the idea of

,_ homosexual intercourse and nauseated

when they witness a show of affection
between homosexual people.

With this in mind, consider the fac-
tion of our country which we are
addressing. Our military -(excluding
ranking officers) is composed almost
entirely of young men. Young men just
reaching the point in their lives when
their feelings of masculinity are as
strong as they are irrational.

These are not open-minded college
professors; for the most part, these are
boys who are most likely from families
where a hatred of homosexuality has
been ingrained in them since early
youth. People who are not homosexual
are ‘generally "inclined to believe that
homosexuality is a deviation from nat-
ural behavior, a perversion of procre-
ation. This is especially applicable to
the generally uneducated ranks of the

0 I If : enlisted military. V

So as soon as self—proclaimed homo-

sexuals are allowed to enter the mili-

tary, there will be conﬂict. Whether or
not men and women will leave the mil-
itary in droves is debatable and will
only be known at the time the ban is
lifted.

Those that stay will be confronted
with a confusing situation. Suddenly,
there will be potential sexual partners
eating, drilling, sleeping and showering

 together. This is. counterproductive to

discipline; and discipline is the founda-
tion of our military.

Barracks in peacetime and trenches
in battle are no place for courtship or
lovers’ quarrels. Also, consider that it
won’t be long before a regular enlisted
man comes across people engaging in
acts of homosexual affection. This is
where the real trouble begins. No one
can argue against the fact that this is a
potentially volatile situation. People
will end up in conﬂict, or worse, peo-
ple will end up dead.

An argument frequently used to sup-
port acceptance of homosexuals into
the‘mi1itary is the example of blacks

‘ and women. In 1948, blacks and

women were admitted to the U.S. mili-
tary. ‘

This prompted many problems but in
the end resulted in a successful integra-

_ other hand is

tion of different races and sexes. So
why not homosexuals? The road may
be bumpy at first, but it will smooth
out eventually. Or will it?

I doubt it. Prejudices aimed against
blacks in 1948 were cultural and ethnic
prejudices based on the perception of
blacks in their role of indentured servi-
tude and as a segregated group. As for
women, they were excluded because
of preconceived notions of their abili-
ties. .

Prejudice against homosexuals on the

homosexuality

giant majority
of Americans
are members
of some reli-
gious group,
and every
group from Catholics to Jews to
Moslems has always taught that homo-
sexuality is not an acceptable practice.
The prejudices against homosexuality
are based on the basic human procre-
ative condition and are not going to go
away. .

Also consider this point: the military

Chris
Diersen

' if has always kept women and men "sepa-

rate in all of the armed forces; and
there is a reason. Men and women

‘placed into a situation where sleeping

quarters are shared, along with show-
ers, the potential for developing rela-
tionships is tremendous, as is the
potential for sexual tension. By separat-
ing sexes, the military rightfully
attempts to avoid these complications.
Knowingly placing a practicing homo-
sexual into such an environment is no
different than placing a man amongst a
platoon of women.

While the_,man knows that not all of
the women are prone to be sexually or
emotionally attracted to him, he is
aware that a certain percentage will be;
and he is likely to pursue their affec-
tions._Such is the case with a homosex-
ual man placed amongst a platoon of
men. Some are bound to be homosexu-
al; and he is, as the man amongst
women is, likely to pursue their affec-
tion. This is unacceptable.

I do not doubt that Bill Clinton will

succeed in lifting the military’s ban on_

homosexuals. It is inevitable. As a per-
son who has watched Clinton’s acces-
sion to the White House with consider-
able reservations, I think it will be very
interesting watching Bill spend the next
four years explaining the Pandora’s box
that he is about to open.

Military is ready for change

There has been much talk lately
about whether or not gay and lesbian
people should be allowed to serve in
the U.S. military and that somehow
having gay and lesbian people in the
military will prevent it from function-
ing. The Pentagon has never had any
evidence to support its exclusionary
policy. Studies commissioned in an
attempt to provide some rational basis
for the policy have "indicated quite the
opposite. Homosexual people scored
just as high as heterosexual people,
and in some
instances even

one of many
investigative
reports from
organizations
such as the
D e f e n s e
P e r s o n n e l
S e c u r i t y
Research and
E d u c a t i o n
Center, the
most fit people
to serve in the
military were
lesbians. The Pentagon, Imight add,
tried to suppress thesereports.

OK, having established that there is
no logical basis for having the policy,
what’s next? Why should we change
the current military establishment? First
of all, this senseless discrimination
goes againstthe American ideals of
‘freedom and equality; the very same
ideals that the military is supposed to
protect. Sounds a bit hypocritical to
me.

Secondly, the policy hurts a lot of
people. Many peoples lives and careers
have been destroyed by Pentagon
witch hunts. A less-than~honorable dis-
charge forlhomosexuality can hurt a
person’s chances of getting a job and
cripple him or her for life.

Third, the policy is used to harass
women in the military. Women are dis-
charged for homosexuality at nearly 10

Todd
Kinavey

_times the rate of men. Women who

resist men’s sexual advances may risk
being accused of being lesbian and
kicked out of the military.

Nobody is saying that integrating gay
and lesbian people into the military is
going to be a piece of cake. There is
going to be some resistance at first,
both from the Pentagon officials and
from many of the soldiers. Some peo-
ple are trying to use these potential
problems as justification for keeping
the ban in place. '

In effect, what they are saying is that
since rectifying the problem of discrim-
ination is going to be difficult, we
should leave things the way they ar.
That is like saying since solving the
problem of segregation was going to
cause a lot of animosity among white

people, we should have left things the
way they were. African Americans won
their civil rights only at the cost of
great social upheaval. The point is that
they still deserve their rights, no mat-
ter. what the cost.

What exactly will be the problems
that arise when we start integrating gay
and lesbian people into the Armed
Forces? Some people claim that the
heterosexual soldiers will feel very
uncomfortable and that many will quit
in protest. ,

People claim that straight soldiers will

not be able to work with, or especially-

take orders from, gay or lesbian sol-
diers. These arguments sound strangely
like the ones used when the military
was debating whether or not to inte-
grate African Americans into the ser-
vice.

There is also the.all—important issue
of sexual attraction. It seems that
everyone is worried about what will
happen when straight men and gay
men have to —— God forbid — shower

together. (Nobody I’ve talked to seems _

to be worried about what happens
when straight women and lesbians
shower together.) They are afraid that
these gay soldiers would be attracted
to their straight counterparts. This situ-
ation would hardly be as widespread
as some people think. Even if it does

arise, I would hope that a person

entrusted with the defense of our
nation would be mature enough to
handle someone else being attracted to
him. '

The problem here his not with gay

people, it is with the uninformed atti—,

tudes of a few straight men. Is it fair to
punish an entire group of people for
the ignorance of a few? It is insulting
to think that gay and lesbian people
are incapable of controlling their sexu-
al desires.

The level of discomfort felt by these
men is nothing compared to the dis-
comfort felt by women who are
harassed by men. If the militarywere
really concerned about this problem,
incidents similar to what happened at
Tailhook would be addressed. The
DOD is worried about the discomfort
of a few straight men to the point of
excluding thousands of gays and les-
bians but does not care enough about
the very serious problem of sexual
harassment against women to do any-
thing about it? This is just another
instance of the DOD’s homophobic
hypocrisy. I

The only two NATO countries which
continue this discriminatory policy are
England and the United States. The rest
of them have integrated their armed
forces without the large scale problems
many people i.n this country are pre-
dicting. These fears are largely

unfounded and it’s time that we start;

addressing the problem instead of
pushing it ‘aside. '

Pitt should keep the current system of registration

Lately there has been much
public discussion about the adop-
tion of a telephone registration
system by Pitt. Compared to the
current system it sounds very
attractive, but there are dangers. I
know someone who attends
Bowling Green State University in
Ohio, a school with telephone
registration. Seventeen thousand

students go there, and backups
on the phone system can last as
long as an hour. Approximately ’
30,000 students attend Pitt —
imagine the backup in a phone
registration system here!

A better solution, I feel, would
be registering through our advi-
sors. They all have computers that
link into the ISIS system, and it

  

 

would be convenient since you
have to see an advisor to get the

registration form anyway. Why do
I have to wait in line in October
to see my advisor for a registra-
tion appointment in November,
then stand in line at Thackeray for
hours to find out my carefully
picked courses are full? It would
be so much easier ifl could do all
my registering in one place.

And finally, a message for Chris

Diersen —— I’ve registered for ﬁve
t€I‘ITlS in the English department,
and I feel that the advisors in that
department are great. Like all of
us, they are simply doing their
best in our honibly ﬂawed regis-
tration system.

Women 's hoops wins city bragging rights over Dukes, 80-6 7

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

For a year at least, the high-topped sneaker

Fifth Avenue will be blue and gold instead of
blue and white. Although Mr. Blackwell might
find the sight of the duo-tone shoes offensive,
Pitt fans across the city will relish the sight of
the fashion parade.

With an 80-67 win over rival Duquesne, the
Pitt Panthers won not only their first game of
the season, but also inter-city bragging rights 2

Coming off a big win against the Czech
National Team, a Pitt letdown was expected.
But _by storming out to a 15-4 lead at 15:09 of
the first half, the Panthers put any notions of
relaxing out of mind.

“[We expected] avlittle bit of a letdown,”
head coach Kirk Bruce said. “We” probably
couldn’t have played much better than we did
[against the Czechs].”

The quick start was supplied by some
tremendous early shooting. Pitt forward Turia
Ransom buried a shot from the top of the key
and then sophomore guard Erin Maloy
knocked in a trey from the left wing to give
the Panthers an early 5-0 lead. Sophomore Jill
Colabrese followed with a jumper from the top
of the key, and it was not until 17:57 that
Duquesne got on the board on a layup by
Duke center Toby Metoyer.

The Panthers did not relax on their big lead.
Instead of sitting back and enjoying the spoils
‘of an excellently—played first eight minutes, Pitt
opened up a lead of eight points at 11:55 of
the first half and never looked back._Their lead
dipped no lower than six points, a 24-18 lead
at 7:31 of the first.

Bruce started the same five as he did against
the Czechs. He employed the guard combina-

Huemrich, Ransom and Colabrese in the frontcourt.

', Without a true center on the floor, the Panthers

were forced to use a quick, strong—sh'ooting
offense. ' .

Duquesne played a much different game than the
Nationals did, Instead of the man-to-man defense

that they saw last week, the Panthers had to deal
with a zone for much of the contest.

The scheme designed to thwart outside shooting
really did not offer much of a challenge. Not only
did Pitt nail a few from long range, but it also
passed efficiently enough to get the ball to shooters

 

ion of dominance against

with attainable, mid-range shots. And
although the 45-percent shooting did not
exactly set the world on fire, the shots were
makable and gave favorable rebounds. Pitt
had a 48-20 advantage on the boards.

The Dukes were without the services of
three of their top players. Point guard Tracey
Paul was out with bruised ribs, Tasha
Williams is still out with an ankle injury (she
will not be back for four to six weeks), and
Chris Chandler is inactive until the 21st of the
month.

The Panthers took advantage of the oppor-
tunity and took the Dukes out of their game.
Early in the second half Duquesne was forced
to take some bad shots as the Pitt defense
stiffened to try to knock the Dukes totally out
of their routine.

But with a mini-spurt midway through the
second half, Duquesne closed what had been
a 25-point lead to 15.

Enter Lisa Fessler.

The senior canned a pair of three—pointers
and a couple medium—range jumpers to finally
put the Dukes out of their misery and the
game out of reach.

“I told Lisa at the beginning of the season
that when she’s open she should shoot the
ball,” Bruce said. “She got a little more play-
ing time tonight than she did in the first
game. She wasn’t totally healthy that first
games so we figured that we didn’t have any-
thing to lose. She is a senior; she’s out there
trying hard so we put her in there.”

By 7:02 the game had officially become a
rout. The Panthers had ballooned their lead to

that Duquesne threw in.

Huemrich led all scorers with 27 points,
many resulting from her tremendous rebound-
ing. Her 14 boards also led all players as

tion of Malloy and Jill McE1hinny with Jonna The W°men'5 basketball team kn°Cked oﬂpuquesne last night‘ ble.

Colabrese threw in 13 and Ransom and Fessler
each had 10 to aid the Panther cause.

Theteam will get its mandatory day off today
before it begins to prepare for its next game — a
Friday night battle with traditional national power

17 pointsand began to answer every basket ,

St. Francis has never beat-

en Pitt in basketball.

In 17 meetings the
Panthers hold an over-
whelming 17-0 vice grip on
the Red Flash. Add to that
Pitt’.s current winning streak
of 10 straight in season-
openers and the hostile
atmosphere of Fitzgerald
Field House.

In other words, do not
anticipate a breakthrough
for St. Francis tonight when
the Panthers and Red Flash
open the 1992-95 season at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Red Flash head coach Tom
McConnell makes his colle-
giate debut after serving as
an assistant coach at
Dayton, Marquette and
Wake Forest. He inherits a
team that went 10-18 last
season and has a terrible
height deficiency.

St. Francis starts three

" guards, with its tallest pro-

jected starter being 6—foot-7-
inch senior center Mike
Fink.

ward Deon George and
guard Bryan Gandee.
George, a 6’5” junior from
Canada, averaged 9.5 points
and 4.4 rebounds in his first
significant action last season
and is expected to step up
this year. I

Gandee, a 6’3” sopho-
more, missed the second
half of last season due to
academic difficulties. He has
been sizzling in the presea-
son, draining 11 of 14 three-
pointers and 12 of 19 from
the floor overall. The other
starters are 5’7” sophomore
Terry Holliman and 6’4”
senior Willie Smith.

Like Pitt, -St. Francis
played a pair of exhibition
games in November. The
Red Flash topped the
Latvian National Team 94-80
behind George’s 22 points
and seven rebounds, while
Gandee chipped in 20. They
dropped a 96-94 decision to
the Verich Reps, an Amateur
Athletic Union (AAU) team.

Gandee led the way with 18 "

THIE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, December 2, 1992

Sports news brings 2'

I feel ill. Maybe it was some-
thing I ate or a whole lot of things
I ate. Thanksgiving does that to
you.

Then again, it could also ‘come
from watching too much sports.

-Speaking of hurling, one per-
son that makes me want to reject
my lunch is Marge “I should be”
Schott. Okay, maybe a ﬁring
squad is a bit extreme. We could
settle for a severe beating and
mairning. Just drop her off in
downtown Tel Aviv (that’s in
Israel for you non-geographical
types) and tell everybody there
about her positive outlook on the
actions of Adolf Hitler.

Some people were angry at the
powers-that-be in baseball for a
slow reaction to her alleged racist
and anti—Semitic comments, but
that is not a problem. They
should take the time to substanti-
ate the allegations. Besides, there
was probably a shock period
when some people, especially
those who are minorities, heard
the comments '

I know I was numb at first -

I as I am  time I hear such ‘

offensive trash.‘These are the
times I really hate the fact that
newspaper writing takesthe curse
words out of my vocabulary.
Saying that Hitler was on the right
track but went too far is more '
offensive than any four-letter
word I have ever heard.
Baseball took the moral high-

ground when former Dodger

‘ General Manager Al Campanis

said African Americans lacked the
necessities to work in a baseball
front office. He was quickly out of
a job.

‘They took to‘the soapbox again
in the Pete Rose case, using

integrity as a reason to ban one of '

the game’s all—tirne greats from the
Hall of Fame. ' .

Scho1I’s comments were worse
than those of Campanis; her
actions worse than those of-Rose.
Now it is time for the owners to
take the same stance with one of
their own. With no commissioner
they are running the show, so
they must take the commissioners
mandate to act in the best inter-
ests of baseball and get rid of
Schott. ’

-Maybe giving up on baseball
will help my stomach. The Pirate
ﬁre sale is enough to cause some
cookie tossing.

Instead ‘of wondering if there
will be a fourpeat, the question
about the ‘93 Pirates is if there will
be anybody left. Josef Stalin could
have learned _a thing or two. from
this purge. Jose Lind, Alex Cole,
Danny Jackson, Roger Mason,

g ' Danny Cox, Gary Redus, Cecil

Espy, Gary Vaisho, Bob Patterson
and Vicente Palacios are gone.
Did I miss anybody? I probably
did. It is hard to keep up. There

Ryan
Buncher

are some stiﬂfs in there, but there
is also a large part of the team that
won the last three National
Ieague East championships.

The latest addition to the list of
the departed is Doug Drabek,
who signed with the Houston
Astros. He actually did not get
much more money than the
Pirates were offering, but who can
blame him for abandoning this ‘
sinking ship?

The above leaves out Barry
Bonds, who is all but gone.
Catcher Mike LaValliere is proba-
bly on the way out too.

I can hear the public address
announcer at Three Rivers

’ Stadium on opening day now.

And now presenting your 1993
Buﬁalo Bisons— er, rat/yer
Pittsburgh Pirates. .

Actually the Bucs are starting to
look like the Bisons, with a collec-
tion of a few good players sur-
rounded by a bunch of retreads

and prospects.

As a Pirate fan I feel like giving
up because my team has. ‘*-

-If anybody else says that
Emmit Smith of the Cowboys
should be the NFL’s MVP this
year, I am not going to be able to
keep anything down for a week.
The Cowboys are playing the best
ball in the league, and Smith is

. having a great year, but he is not

the most Valuable player.
For those who have not

0
ll feelz ngs
noticed, Barry Foster is leading
the league in rushing, not Smith.

0 They may not be doing as well as

the Cowboys, but the Steelers are
having an outstanding year. Foster
is more important to Pittsburgh
than Smith is to Dallas.

Dallas has Troy Aikman at
quarterback, an excellent group of
receivers led by Pro Bowl players
like wide-out Mike Irvin and tight
end Jay Novacek and the top-
rated defense in the NFC.

As for the Steelers, quarterback
Neil O’Donnel1 has struggled of
late. His receiving corps is
nowhere near as good as that of
the Cowboys, and they are
banged up too. ’

Steve Young’s great year for the
49ers makes all of this moot. His
shining stats and winning record
with the ghost of the not—quite-
gone Joe Montana hanging over
Candlestick Park makes Young
the top MVP candidate. But if it
does go to a running back, Foster
is the man. '

.-At least the Pitt football team
is in Hawaii for its last game, so I
can avoid watching it more easily.
That thought might just soothe my
stomach enough for me to read
back through this column. I think
I will wait a while, just to be safe.

Ryan Buncber is the Sports
Editor of The Pitt News.

Shareef, a potential key
player this season, has been
shooting the ball better
according to Evans.

“His confidence is maybe‘ 7

at an all—time high at this
point,” Evans said.

McNeal believes Pitt’s
blend of Veterans and youth
will provide a talented mix
if everybody gets into the
flow of the offense. That
means keeping the confi-
dence level high, something
McNeal said he will tell
Pitt’s shooters.

“I’ll just tell them to keep
shooting,” he said. “They’re

not going to miss all of

them. Just tell them ‘it’s
gonna fall for you.”’
