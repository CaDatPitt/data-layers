Over Furick's Opposition

BY BILL MOORE

Despite strong opposition from
Student Government Board (SGB)
president Mike Furick, the new
election code proposed by the
Student Government Election
Committee (SGEC) was approved
by the board at a special meeting
Friday. _

The code, following final revision
by a Constitutional Review Com-
mittee, will be taken before the
student‘ body in the next election. If
approved by the voters, the code
will become an amendment to the
SGB constitution.

Furick's objections to the code
centered around a final paragraph
placing the determination of
operational by-laws in the liands of
the SGEC. ,

SGEC chairman Chuck Diederich
defined operational by—laws as
“dates, deadlines, places. times
and things like that. Any require?‘
ments necessary to conduct the
election that are not speciﬁcally
stated in the code." '

- F uriek argued that a future SGEC
could use this power to aid the
campaign of a specific candidate,

A and that future SGB’s should have
provisions to prevent such ’ a
problem.

“The only provision we have now
is to can the whole "election
committee. but thatis too drastic,"
Furick said.

“If you have to use that provision.
you have it," answered Diederich.
“but something small like dates or
places shouldn7t concern [the
board." -

SGB member Bruce Keeler
agreed, saying “i see it as very
possible that a future SGEC\could
play political games, but on the
g g other hand, I see it as impossible
that any future SGB could not play

 

 
 
   

wasup to-them" to decide if there

A political games.” *

Diederich said the SGEC'_s ration-
ale for the controversial clause was
to “insure the" political nature of
the board does not interfere with a
fair election. And if you are going

to shut the door on this, you have to A

shut it completely."
The SGB and SGEC agreed to

Lab/or Board Ends Suit
Over ‘Untdir' Pitt Policy

BY PETE BUTCH

Charges of unfair labor practices
against Pitt have been dismissed
by the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board. The charges, filed last
month by the American Federation
of, Teachers (AFT) and the
Pennsylvania State Education
Association (PSEA). stemmed from
the‘ distribution of a Faculty
Activity Plan Questionnaire by
Dean James Kelly of the School of
Education. '

The charges stated, “ (University
of Pittsburgh) unilaterally estab-
lished _a faculty activity plans
process...clearly changing terms
and conditions of employment in
discouraging faculty participation
in concerted activities to seek
collective bargaining representa-
tion under Act 195.”

Under Act 195. a state employee
relations law, it is illegal to change
the terms and
employment while a union is
petitioning for recognition. The
AFT felt Kelly's questionnaire
violated this act.

Kelly initiated the questionnaire
upon reconimendation of the
University Senate about a year ago,
to determine future enrichment
goals and current competencies of
the faculty to’ see if Pitt could start
programs to aid the faculty in their
enrichment goals.

The questionnaire came out last
September, after the AFT and
PSEA petitioned for the right to
represent Pitt faculty in collective
bargaining.

Pitt Employee Relations Co-
ordinator Thomas Cherry stated,
‘.'Thc two unions (AFT and PSEA)

felt the Faculty Activity Report was-

an unfair labor practice. feeling
that it intimidated entployees not to
join the union. The Labor Relations
Board reviewed the charge and it

“However, they dismissed .the.

charges, meaning there‘ was’ no

hearing," he said.

The dismissal stated, “The Board

of the opinion that there is nothing

The results of the lottery will be
available early Thursday morning

and may be claimed until Friday.

afternoon. The names and ID
numbers of the winners will be
posted in the Student Government
offices and -the Student Union
Ticket Office.

Meloro said the tickets were made
available to his office on Friday,
but he’s not sure just where they
came from. As to the possibility of
still more tickets being made

available, Meloro said, “I just
don’t know.”
I-Ie speculated. however, the

tickets may have come from‘ a
mix-up inxthe student allotment to
the regional campuses. “The
Athletic Ticket Office received 300
tickets for the branch campuses but
300 had already been delivered
from the Student Union ticket
office. So 30Q of the 578 tickets can

‘be accounted for," Meloro said.
President '

Student Government
Mike Furick said “from somewhere
the t'ickets just miraculously
appeared" and complained that
students might consider the lottery
as unfair as the previous distribu-
tion practice which resulted in a
rapid sell-out.

Meloro replied, “No matter_ what
you do, no matter what system you
use, people will complain if they
,don’t get a ticket."

Originally, student tickets were
made available last week. Only
6225 students actually received
tickets from the Student Union

Amendment OpensSchoo| File

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT .—
Students over 18 years of age

enrolled in schools receiving public

funding will be allowed to examine
all their personal college or univer-
sity files beginning tomorrow,
when the congressional act known
as the Buckley amendment is
slated to take effect. A
The Buckley amendment, signed

«by President Ford last August, is‘

part of an act entitled, “Education
Amendments of 1974.” The bill
also permits parents of children in
non-private schools to examine all
data, including personal comments
by teachers, IQ tests and trans-
cripts, pertaining to their children.

Assistant to the Chancellor Charles
Coble '

issue, and it will have a massive
impact.

"As far as 1 know, there are

several moves in Congress to delay
the implementation, which should
begin on the 18th, or 19th. Frankly,
we would like some extra time to
prepare for it."
V One movement to delay the bill’s
enforcement is headed by Senator
Claiborne Pell [D-RI] who is'pre-
pared to seek legislation to that
effect. However, the bill’s suppor-
ters feel that any such action would
postpone long denied civil rights
and detract from the"b'ill’s' effec-
tiveness.

“A great number of students and

‘parents willbe awfully upset if itiis

delayed,“ a spokesman for Senator
James Buckley (D-NY), author of
the legislation, said to the New
York Times. ,

The amendment also specifies

Rockefeller choice hit

 Abzug Blasts Frd's Policies

BY BILL MOORE

Congresswoman _ Bella Abzug"

(D-NY), criticized President Gerald
R. Ford’s present economic policies
and, voiced opposition to_ the
appointment of Nelson R. Rocke-
feller as vice-president in a speech

‘ at Chatham College Saturday.

Abzug also expressed her views
on the Mideast crisis, Watergate,
student activism, and the place of
women -"in politics.

“President Ford is going to have
to; put taxes where they can be
afforded, not on the ordinary

"’merican,” she said.

“I think we need to have a very

‘strong program,” Abzug said. She

suggested elimination _of present

' tax loopholes, a price roll-back, and

a drastic cut of the military budget

A as means to curb inﬂation. -

- On the Rockefeller appointment,
Abzug said, “I think it is _quite

clear that the American people

don’t want Mr. Rockefeller as
vice-president. I think President
Ford made a mistake in nominating

him, and I call for him to recall that‘

nomination.” -
She criticized Rockefeller for
“remaining silent throughout
Watergate," his support of the

. Vietnam war, and the controversial

Rockefeller gifts. “Mr. Rockefeller
may call them gifts, -but other
people call them bribes,” Abzug
said.

Abzug called on the United
States, the Soviet Union, and other
countries to “reassert their posi-

the Nixon tide," she_ added.

tion on Israel” and said “the
survival of the state of Israel is not
negotiable.”

She called for the removal of Joint
Chiefs of Staff chairman -Gen.
George Brown for ' “outrageous
anti-Jewish remarks reminiscent of,
Nazi philosophy.” .

The congresswoman termed

‘Watergate a “massive manipula-

tion by_ the president’s men to
arrange a Nixon victory -and

deprive us of a free election.”
“We were on the verge .of a“

dictatorship, but we didn’t go over
the edge,” Abzug said.

“And the press was so intimid-
ated by threats from Agnew: and
the FCC that they swam alongwith
“If
you think this is a partisan speech,
you're right. I’m a partisan--for
the American people."

power that we will

' Abzug mentioned what she called
“the unpardonable pardon” and
called for the testing of the pardon
in the courts. ‘Because until then,
the American people won’t be

_satisfied that we have an-equal

system of justice under the law,”
she said.

She criticized the all-male Senate
saying, “a stag ..Senate . is a
stagnation. All I ask is for the
government to begin to look like
the co_untry, that the government
start having women in it.’_’

Abzug called 1974 “the year of
the woman in politics" and said
women had established their right
to run in the post-Watergate
elections. "‘I think we have had so
little opportunity to be corrupted by
make the
difference, she said. “We are
taking the woman's traditional role
of cleaning up the mess in
government.”

Asked her opinion, on the role of
the college student, Abzug said it
was important they remain invol-
ved. “It has been said that more
than four young people died at
Kent State, that the hopes of young
people died there too,” she said.

“Young people should come into
politics, because change is poss-
ible,” Abzug told the predomin-
antly student crowd.

On ' ﬁnancial aid for college
students, Abzug said the priorities
of the present administration were
elsewhere. “But I’m -hopeful we
can do something about that in the
next congress.” she said. ,

 should restore academic credit for students enrolled in ROTC
 As Pitt ROTC Coordinator Robert Nossen indicated recently
'9 'tt is one of only 13, schools in the United States which offer ROTC
urses without academic credit. ’ '

The rationale for the faculty’s vote in 1968 was that the curriculum of
 ROTC programs was not controlled locally but rather by the
 ‘tional ROTC program, and, also, the faculty were concerned with
 students the maximum freedom of choice possible. Thus, it
7' as alleged ROTC credit was a violation of academic freedom.
Inretrospect the reasons for the faculty’s decision seem nebulous and
labelistic. The ROTC program can be as valuable and intrinsic a
department at the University as biochemistry, English and math. And
Nossen has recently indicated the issue of Pitt control over the
 is no longer valid. He has pledged to upgrade the standards
oftheprogramifitisdeterrninedtheyarenotrigid enoughtowarrant
_credit. Thus, quite clearly, Nossen is saying the Pitt ROTC program
 regulated and administered by the Pitt ROTC faculty.
Then, there is the concern of the faculty ‘to provide a student with the
maximum amount of freedom of choice possible. _Six years ago ROTC
credit was considered a violation of that freedom. If that argument was
ever valid, then, it certainly holds no water in 1974. If anything the Pitt
policy on ROTC violates a student’s freedom of choice and
discriminates against students for not awarding, academic credit for
academic and pre-professional work. '

 student entering the ROTC program is aware of the regulations
which must be obeyed and is cognizant of the effect his participation in
the program will have on his future.’ If a student is willing to subject
himself to the military life he should be permitted to do so without
being penalized for his career selection.

7-No one is forced to enter the ROTC program. Without the draft no
 is compelled to enter the program to remain in college. The

academic credit for ROTC.
‘It should also be remembered that throughout the history of the
program ROTC has ﬁnanced needy students’ educations. In some
cases without the assistance of the ROTC program students could
never have graduated from college. That should not be forgotten.
"Also, ROTC credit was revoked as a result‘ of an anti-militaristic
attitude sweeping the nation due to American participation in the
Vietnam war. That attitude which still prevails among many people
,':..today can not be allowed to dictate the rational concerns of the
“University community. V
The circumstances surrounding the original vote six years ago should
"be remembered. Those circumstances indicate the faculty’s vote was
 invalid decision on the subject. That meeting was closed to the
public and ROTC students, the most affected by the vote, were not
 permitted to address the faculty to ease their-concerns. Additionally,
only. 42% of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted on the issue, this
,.being only 15% of the total Pitt faculty.
A Under no circumstances should this be construed as an approvalof
 or military life_. We are affirming the individual’s right to
 choose the course of his own life without being forced to suffer

as a result of non-credit for their participation’ in the ROTC program.
Hopefully, the faculty in the near future will seek to be ‘responsive to
all Pitt students, recognize the circumstances surrounding the original
decision six years ago, and restore academic credit for courses in

Happy Days with Democrats

BY BET NELSON
“Happy days are here again"
was the resounding chant heard in
Democratic campaign headquar-

ters across the country as their

gains were tabulated.

Indeed. it was a cheerful scenario
which faced the Democrats who
had been soundly defeated by the
political entity known as Richard
M. Nixon in 1972. They not only
won, they won big in sections of the
US that seemed to be drifting
toward Republican control.

Democrats acrossthe nation were
jubilant over the wins scored
against the multitudes of GOP

O / C
mcumbants. No one could seriously ,

deny the importance of the number
of seats won in this off-year
election. Indeed, a Democratic
victory had been achieved.

An additional 43 Congressional
seats _were seized by Democrats
this year. Three more Senate seats
fell to Democratic challengers. A
total of 36 state governments are

now under Democratic control. In -

essence, roughly‘/4 of the entire

population of the US is now under

Democratic leadership be it on the

Federal or the State governmental
‘levels.

Near-sighted leaders of the
Democratic Party, however, are
calling the victory a mandate from
the people. This is just not the
case. The American people have
had enough of mandates such as
the so-called mandate’ given by the
people to Richard Nixon in 1972.

A much more thorough analysis of
the events does indicate the
victories representa weak “cry for
help” from 38% of the voters who
actually went to the polls. It was a
punishment for the Republicans,

A Responsive Decision

not a reward for the Democrats.
The Democrats have provided poor

leadership during the economic»

crisis of the past ten months. They
had established nothing more than

a holding pattern until the general .

ele_ction_s of ’74 were over.
.Robert Strauss correctly stated
the situation when he said on
election night “the victory isn't
tonight - the opportunity starts
tonight.” In other words, the
Democrats must produce credible,
progressive leadership not -just in
time for the ’76 elections, but now.
If everyone skips the next two
years and does not put forth a
progressive legislative _ program
aimed at stopping inﬂationary
trends. easing the cost of food,
adding jobs to the work force,
then, the Democrats might as well

start looking at 1984 (if this nation _

makes it that far).

The Democratic victory is not as
great as most Democrats predicted
or as bad as most GOP candidates

_feared. It was, however, a sizable

victory. It is not. the veto-proof
Congress that the Democrats had
hoped for during the campaign.

Just the same, President will,
as a result of the elections, have to
come up with more progressive
economic pr_ograms or face a
hostile Democratic 94th Congress
which might consider such actions
as wage-price controls or vote an
expansionary budget with such
items as federallyfunded jobs, to
counter recession."

The real question which faces
Democratic leadership is one of
pulling it all together. “What will
we be able to do now that we have
our victory," is the question many
Democratic presidential hopefuls

for removing all questions’of doubt concerning the fairness of ‘the V
elections. F\rrick’s vote against the code, while not unexpected,
represented an unwillingness or an inability on his part to understand
the role of the SGB as a spectator in the elections process.

But, where were the other three Student Government Board
members? Paul Hertneky failed to attend Friday's emergency meeting
and left Wednesday's regular SGB meeting before the code became an
issue. Board members Ruth Weinbrom and Mary Heider failed to even
make an appearance throughout the debate. All three have failed to
meet their responsibilities on this concern. Their votes on this very
significant question should be on the record so Pitt students can
adequately judge the quality of their representatives.

On another matter, however, the Board (at least those members who
were present) voted unanimously to form a. constitutional review
committee to make the elections code a pemianent mechanism of

_ Student Government. This will certainly supply the elections process

are asking themselves. ,
They realize if inflation continues
to grow, if recession reaches
deeper into middle America and if
unemployment grows the presi-
dency may slip into the hands of an
extremist of right political persuas-
ion in either party. The worst
possibility existing now is that of-a
third party which will take overiand
grow in number from the ranks of
disenchanted Republicans and
Democrats right of center.
Regardless of the political rhetoric

that has been enunciated one thing‘

is clear, the Democrats do have the
progressive leadership to put
together a legislative program to
combat the domestic ills of -this
nation if they work together for the
good of the American people. No
winner alone has a definite plan of
action to hold inflation, ﬁnd jobs or
aid those who are hungry in this
nation. ‘ , -

It must be a combined effort of
Democratic liberals, moderates and
conservatives to initiate progres-
sive legislation that will not come
from the White House. This is what
the newly elected.Democratic Con-
gress should‘ strive for in the two
years to come. Then, they will be
able to achieve the progress the
nation has asked for at the polls.

.‘,_‘You have to get ripped off a few
‘mes in order to learn. Just keep
r‘ eyes open...cheating is a way
f- life down here,” Tom Keefe is
aying. It is 5:30 in the morning
iid the Strip District is as crowded
nd bustling as Forbes Avenue on a
irgiday night.

 Tom double checks in his little
lack notebook what/he needs to ﬁll

er/is oblivious to the rush of
hiny-eyed workers pushing cart-
'ads of crated lettuce and celery

Aorescent aisles of the wholesale

talking and yelling at each other --
elling and buying produce, com-
iserating about the Pirates losing

tlher -- all the while dodging carts
grand forklifts. But Toni Keefe, tall_,
-'t"h‘in”,,»short haired, long bearded,
nd very reserved, stands quietly
.among the crated vegetables,
j-studying his order book. He looks
.‘;more like a nineteenth century
illustrator admiring his sketch book
than a produce buyer. But he
knows how not to get ripped off.

The old guy laughs and moves on..

What can he say to that?

Tom replaces the cabbage,
unfazed by the awkward inter-
change. He’s here to buy produce

-- not to bullshit with crowds .of ,

people. In another three or four

months he’s going to quit the Co-op

and move with his wife to the farm

they bought in West Virginia.

He doesn’t really get into jagging
around with strangers -- the limited
society of farm life will suit him just

‘fine. After all, when he was in
college, studying philosophy, the ’

thinker who influenced him most
was Henry Thoreau, who made so
much sense to Tom Keefe that he
left school in his senior year
without graduating. The only

us a fair deal so we give them our
business}:

Semple Street’ Co-op

BY ARN IE GREENWALD
Susanne Hesse, manager of the
Semple St. Co-Op, likes to think of

‘ the co-op as an alternative in eating

and in living. She has been a‘ part
of the operation almost since it's
birth in December 1972 when some
of the people involved in the newly
bankrupted Oakland Co-Op got
together to try again.

The first year of the co-op was a
year of ‘getting known in the
community, and there was a small
loss. Now, the organization owned
collectively by its members is
solvent. "

The_co-op _at the corner of Semple
and Ward Streets in Oakland tries

mainly to handle foods, meaning.

foods not treated with chemical
sprays, pesticides, or fertilizers of
any time. Produce for the store is
bought from local organic growers

' when available——- if not, the_co-op

buys them from local produce
yards, which are not necessarily
organic. Grains and most of the
other foodstuffs come from Mary-
land wlyere they are grown natur-

_ally. The natural label means the

seeds of the plants have not been
chemically treated. and the product

is the highest quality possible of '

not organic. Local distributors sup-

ply'the co,-op with eggs, cheese,

and cider. A
Anyone can buy from the co-op,

I but members pay less. Tojoin, one

buysgone share of the co-op, which
sells for $5, and either works one
hour a month or pays $1. That's all.
Suprisingly, non member food
prices compare very favorably with
major local grocery stores.

Mary Koto, a co-op member from
East Liberty, says she joined the
co-op over two years ago because
she, “likes the concept." She
usually puts in two-and-a-half
hours work at the store a month‘.

Other members like Ruth and
Doug Nelson joined mainly to buy
food cheaper. “The prices on the
spices are fantastic,” the Nelsons
claim, and their only complaint is
they have a long way to travel from
Shadyside on bicycles.

The store caters mainly to the '
needs of the members and the
ethnic groups of the neighborhood
(where else would. you find. buck-
wheat lasagna?).

The warm and friendly atmo-
sphere in the co-op extends to the
customers too. The employees
have the time and inclination to
help the shoppers, and among the
shoppers themselves there is a
Congeniality. Strangers strike up
conversations easily _in the small
store. Posted on the walls are ideas
on how to best use the foods. and
recipes. A , ‘

“We’d also like,” says Hesse
“to show people the benefits of
co-operating together and trusting

. Pyramid Zen:Way to Reality 9

I -—n

.3‘: n J

BY JOHN POULIN
Playing for hours in a sandbox.
Or peddling around in circles on
their tricycles. Or jumping up and
down when the ding dong man
comes by with ice-cream cones.
Some say kids are in a world of
their own--apart from reality.
3 Out of’ the sandbox and into the
office. Off the tricycle and into a
car. From an ice-cream cone to a
bottle of beer. Is the grown-up’s
world any different? Is his adult
perception of Reality any more
authentic than the child’s?

Pyramid Zen is the way modern

man can approach understanding «

of “Big R” Reality, according to
Richard Rose, aiman who has
been pondering the riddle of Re
ality for most of his 57 years.

Does the grown-up leave a false
perception of Reality behind him?
Or are all that is bygone soiled
knees from the sandbox, cuts and
bruises from falling off the tricycle

and sticky ﬁngers from melting-

ice-cream cones?

Does the future have in store for
us more facts and less fairytales
about reality? 1 ' .

Does twentieth century ma/n grasp
Reality any better than his
predecessors? -

ltis through Zen that modern man
can approach the understanding of
“Big R" Reality.

Richard Rose, a man who has been
pondering the riddle of Reality for
most of his 57 years. “Culture is
just more elaborate stage props.”

In the United States, he said,
these props are the products of
technology. By “pursuit of happi-
ness” we essentially mean the
material gains of technology.

According to Rose, technology is a
farce that obstructs our contact
with Reality in two ways: First, we
have become robots functioning
along established guidelines which
are nothing more than illusion.
Second, we have faith that science
somehow can provide answers to
all our questions.

“-What is a mind? What is a
conscience? Ca_n we claim thought
as our doing?” These. Rose claims,
are just a few of the many
questions that are beyond the
scientific method.

Rose turned elsewhere for an-
swers years ago in his Search for
solutions to what he calls
riddle of life and death." After
sifting through piles of philoso-
phies, religions and cults, he finally
came upon a method of resolution:
Zen.

Zen is a method of direct
confrontation and experience of
Reality. lt’s origins date back to
India more ‘than 25 centuries‘ ago.

Paradoxically, Zen is not an
answer but a question. Zen masters
maintain the ﬁrst step to every
answer is a question. And the
capacity for answering that ques-
tion lies within the questioner.

The individual makes a transition
from reality to Reality. He leaves

behind his subjective experience-

what Rose calls the “fairytale

“the ..

,.

we’ve all agreed to accept” -- and
moves beyond the bounds of space
and time toward supreme enlight-
enment--satori--the absolute ex-
perience of the “everything and
nothingness of all that is.” .

f‘It is a state of becoming, rather
than wisdom,” Rose said. “Any-
one can become big R Reality. We
know nothing in the final analy-
sis.” _

“The absolute experience is
impossible to describe,” Rose said.
“But there is no longer any doubt
that you have reached it. The hills
are no longer hills and the valleys
are no_ longer valleys.”

Satori is reached through the
awakening of a higher intuitive
power; the ﬁve barricades of the
senses are abandoned. Enlighten-
ment is—approached by retreating
from error rather than advancing
on postulates. This is done in
conjunction with group confronta-
tions and meditational techniques.

Rose said there is no universal. 

diagram for people interested in
Zen. He is author of an approach
titled “The Albingen Papers,” and
advocates of a subjective storming
of the gates of Reality. Everyone,’
he pointed out, has their own life.
Rose recently completed a series
of introductory lectures on Zen
around area campuses. He was
sponsored by Pitt’s Pyramid Zen

Society which holds open meetings _

every Thursday in room 319 of the
Student Union at 7:30 pm for all
interested in pursuing the path.
Asked about his motivation as a
Zen author and lecturer, Rose‘
replied: “I made a promise to
myself that if ever I found out
anything I'd make it available."

never read Thoreau, see him as a
rube, a mark. Many’s the hippie
out after ‘a good deal who has
discovered later, at home, that
every grapefruit under the top. row
is rotten and inedible. That has
happened to Tom.

This morning no one has
tomatoes. The local stuff is about
done and the -Ohio hothouse
tomatoes, the bestxyou can get in
the winter, haven’t started coming
in, yet. The only thing around are
some sickly green California

’ tomatoes at exorbitant prices. «But
- pears are plentiful and cheap. Tom

walks up to a pear man.

“How much?” he asks, pointing
to some brownish pears in an open
crate. The man nods at the pears
and quotes his price.

“Bose” are real classy,” he says
approvingly. Then he spits a wad of
snot onto the cement‘ﬂoor next to
the crate and neatly covers the glob

with his foot. Tom buys the pears.

His decisions are usually right on
the beam. it’s even rumored
among the other .Co-op workers
that Tom’s decisions are what got
the place operating at a proﬁt for

the ﬁrst time since the store

opened last year. And it’s pretty
easy to see that Tom Keefe knows
what he wants. When the salesmen
come at him with their pitches,
they could be talking to the air until
they finally get around to giving the
price. Tom examines the produce
while the salesman spiels on and
then. without looking away from
the crate, he Imumbles, “How
much?" and if he wants it, he nods
his head -- If the price is too high,
he just ‘walks away.

There are a couple of people who

sell to the Co-op that get .a more_ “

friendly treatment from Tom. Folks
like the Sirianis who grow their
stuff on a couple of acres in
Bellevue that looks like a postcard
of the old country. These people
know the earth and how to make
things grow. They are not hustling
businessmen. Tom admires them
and tries to learn little things from
them that will help him on his own
farm. -

a whole different thing. Even when

way to insure getting what you pay

So, by then his cart is all the way
down to the end of the long
warehouse, Tom has done a lot of
work. It's past seven and light is
already pushing in through the
loading dock entrances. It's getting
to be breakfast time. And right at
the end of the warehouse is a huge
stack of crated melons. A couple of
cantaloupes, squashed on the
concrete are creating an irresista-
ble jungle aroma. Cantaloupes are
out of season and priced pretty
high, today, but these are good
looking fruit that will probably sell
at any price. Tom rubs his
foreﬁnger over his lower lip,
weighing the pros and cons  why
not?

So now, seven thirty in the
morning and getting light out, Tom
Keefe loads the last of his
purchases into_ the bed of the

Flick Crops Out

“Gombler" Loses High Stoke

BY M. C. PILECKI

In moviedom, the gambler has
always had a split personality.

More often thannot, he/she is a
glamorous figure playing and
usually winning against great odds,

g much to the A admiration of
 \supporting characters. , On the
A other hand, the gambler is a

pitiable character playing only to
lose--not only money, but self-
respect, family and oftenxlife itself.

It all depends on which ﬂick you
see. ‘

Well, The Gambler tries to look at
both sides (with a definite leaning
toward _the not so glaniorous end).
But"not very successfully.

One of the problems with Karel
Reisz’ look at the gambler is a too
dry, Sunday preacher approach.
He plays down the very attractive
side of gambling with ease by
reducing it to a c_lassroom exercise,

_,_§ but he fails to heighten the drama
'4?‘-"’v effectively when dealing with the
more seamy side of the problem.
This is imperative when 1 putting
together one of these “social
problem” flicks, and it’s what
made Days of Wine and Roses and
The -Lost Weekend such powerful
statements on alcoholism.

But The Gambler lacks any such
gf, high drama. Rather, the movie
seems to want to be “objective.”

Translate that as meaning director
Reisz wavers in showing on which
side he stands.

The movie concerns Axel Freed
(James Caan), an English instruc-
tor of undetermined rank at a New
York college (referred to, catchily
enough, as New York College). He
is bitten by the gambling bug,
attracted by the desire and the risk

'11-‘ that, he says, translates into
“2+2=S," or believing that one
can will his grasp beyond his reach.

As you may have noticed from the
film’s ads, he gets himself into a
very nasty debt--$44,000 worth--
and spend most of the film trying to
dig his way clear. First he gambles
what cash he has left, and loses.
Then he gets the cash from his

“What the ending is supposed to
make us think is the final
descendancy of this character, so
honored and respected at the
beginning of the ﬂick. His mother
says nice things about him, his‘
grandfather adores him, even the
mugs, after him have constant
praise on their lips for his erudite’
sophistication. lt’s a good thing
that all these people say nice things
about him, or we’d never know he
was such a great guy.

He seems a spoiled brat, all right,

Dances 0 “Love Story”

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

“They danced it not as a ballet,
but a love story in a small cafe in
Paris," was the tribute choreo-
grapher Leonide Massine paid to
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
Friday night. In return, the
company dedicated its program of
Dohnanyi Suite, Pas de Quatre and
Gaite Parisienne to “The Great
Massine."

Heinz Hall was the stage for a
world premiere ‘with Dohnanyi
Suite, and perhaps it was that stage
which caused such ‘a constrained
audience reaction.  This ballet,
commissioned by the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre, consists only of it
very stylized, ritualistic dance with
no story or props_. Done on that

huge stage in front of a brilliant-

blue backdrop which, gradually
darkened, the dancers‘ appeared

like marionnettes. The overpower-.

ing effect of the space above,
behind and around them left an
impression of animated dolls,
which predictably leftthe audience

The Gambler suffers from a lack
‘of decisive direction and sound
foundations for plot and -character
development. The story is too
easily predicted by the audience,
which eventually just laughs at.the
soap operaish continuing plight of
the hero. It just sort of dwindles to
the ridiculous.

her individuality by wearing a
noticeably clunky necklace and
bracelet. The effect was the jarring
suspicion that she was not one of
four dancers, but a woman in
costume.

The costuming, copied from
lithographs of the 1845 perfor-
mance of the “pas” was classical,
and the effect of the four pink
figures against the same-deep blue
back drop used in thefirst. ballet

‘was simply beautiful. The use of

the same pose of the four figures at
the beginning and at the end of
their solos brought a nice sense of
unity to the dance. It was also nice
to feel the audience warming to the
dance. _
The. increasing warmth was
\brought to a climax in the ﬁnal
ballet, “Gaite Parisienne.” The
audience loved the colorful story of
Paris life, mostly because the cast
seemed to love performing it.
Everyone, from the exuberant
waitors to the can can girls to the
major characters danced with that
special enthusiasm which has to‘
capture an audience. Special
recognition has to go to Dinko
Bogdanic. in the part‘ of the
Peruvian flirting with Paris life.
His lively style and the utilization

' of the humor in the role practically

stole several-scenes from the entire
company.

:1‘ he performance of the ‘dancers

was underscored and ampliﬁed by
the exuberant music which per-
vades “Gaite Parisienne.” The
score was first pieced together by
Manuel Rosenthal in 1938 from
several Jacques Offenbach oper-
ettas‘, and the effect was happily
noticeable on Friday night.

In addition to the mood of the ﬁnal
ballet and the music, the audience

left Heinz Hall with the satisifed '
feeling of having watched several
ﬁne talents. The pleasure ‘of
watching Dagmar Kessler’s almost
classical purity blending with
JoAnn ‘McCarthy's liveliness and
Jordeen lvanov‘s dramatic style
should convince anyone present on
Friday that the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre includes enough ‘diversity
-to warrent a return visit--soon.

Rare Breed of Voice 

‘BY JIM OPPENHEIMER
At 8:30 pm, November 16, when

the curtain rises on the production ‘

“A Baroque Entertainment,” pre-
sented by the Ijieinz Chapel Con-

cert/Choir, and COTA, one of the ,

performers will be Daniel Collins,
who has the distinction’ of being

one of about three counter_tenors \

presently singing in. ‘the United
States. '
Collins holds a master’s degree in
voice from the New England Con-
servatory, Boston, and was a
member, until its recent demise, of
the New York Pro Musica.
' Many people, myself included,
have misconceptions of just what a
count_ertenor is. Collins explained

that this unusally high male voice
/has a very firm place in vocal
literature, dating from the twelfth
to the seventeenth centuries.
Although it is seldom used "in
modern compositions, there is a
major part for it in A Midsummer
Night’s Dream, an opera by one of
England's greatest living compo-.1
sers, Benjamin Britten. ,

It is a somewhat popular myth
that countertenors sing parts or- .. —
ginally written for castrati, male 7
singers ‘who were castrated asrtﬂ
boys. Actually, this is not neces- “’

Rare Breed Of Voice

(Continued from Paye 10)

the parts written for castrati. More

" commonly, the countertenor parts

are written for a high tenor voice,
or for a baritone voice‘ singing in
falsetto, a technique most often
found in yodeling or in “shower”
singing wich enables the singer to

. sing much higher than his normal

range, but in a much softer tone.

III fact. there are today two types
In Collins‘ case,
there is the true countertenOr——the
singer who has a very high range.
and can sing the high notes of his
range with greater control than the
ordinary tenor can. In the case of
the English style countertenor, the
singing is dOne.in falsetto.

The castrato voice is quite differ-
ent. Says Collins, “The castrati
were incredibly unique people,
because when they made that
physical change at that stage in
their lives, it of course effected
their’ entire development. They
were very skinny people, with
barrel-like chests, who had breath

control that was just unparalleled‘,
at any other time by any other type

singer. And of course they sang
much higher than either falesettists

_ V‘ or normal countertenors now do.”

The demand for the countertenor
was especially high during. the
medieval and renaissance times
because female voices were not

permitted in church. Typically,
boys sang the soprano parts while
countertenors sang the alto parts.

Asked about the period in which
the countertenor was popular, and
whether_ this was a limiting factor,
Collins replied, “It's an incredibly
large amount of time. Everyone
thinks of a countertenor as being a
super-specialist—in a sense, he's a
super-Specialist, Since there's not a
very large audience which is gear-
ed to appreciate what he does, on
the one hand, but on the other
hand. there’s so many more years
of music that he can sing."

He illustrated his point by men-

tioning that he had recently done i
an all-Dufay concert, and in the

concert this Saturday, he will be
singing in works which are two
hundred years younger than the
fifteenth century Dufay works.

Purcell and Monteverdi are seven-

teenth century composers. In

addition, since some of Collins’
repertoire dates back to the twelfth
century, he sings pieces from a
time spanningifive hundred years.

The time between Bach and Bach-
arach is just half ‘that.

Collins mentioned

that Henry

Purcell, composer of the Ode to ’

Saint Cecilia, one of the works
being featured at Saturday's con-

cert, was himself a countertenor of,

the falsetto type. There are records
on which Purcell himself perform-

ed, some of these which will be
performed Saturday. ‘

Major plans for the future for
Collins include singing in “a truly
Baroque version" of Handel’s The
Messiah, at Carnegie Hall (New
York), and a debut at La Scala. He
is also a member of the Ensemble
for Early Music, a group of
musicians specializing in medieval,
renaissance-, and baroque works.
He intends to continue performing
baroque opera, one of his favorite
musical forms, and would like to
sing the part of the evangelist in
Bach's St. Matthew Passion some-
day. If he .ever does, I hope I can
hear it.

he's expected to be among the first
two or three players chosen in the
North American Soccer League
draft.

About seven minutes after his
brother's score, Chris Bahr drib-
bled a 30-yar’cleI-through Pitt
goaltender Frank Bucci at the left
goalpost for his 11th goal in 11
games. Soon thereafter State
upped its lead to 3-0 when Rich
Reice scored from point-blank

range on the rebound of a hard shot ,

that left Bucci hopelessly out of
position.

Just when it looked like the Cats
were going to be blown away by the
Lions’ power, they came together
and played about 30 minutes of
aggressive, hustling soccer, and

4 went off at halftime trailing by just

3-2.

Pitt first got on the scoreboard
just 39 seconds after Reice's goal.
Center forward John Curley was
injured in a collision at the PSU
goalmouth, and right wing Bill Rex
won the scramble for the loose ball.
His quick shot was blocked by
goalie Tim Dantzig, but left winger
John Morahan, sweeping in from
the other side, booted home the
rebound to make it 3-1.

Tremendous hustle, especially by
wingers Rex and Morahan, half-
back Alan Jutca and fullback Ernie
Gross. enabled the inspired Pan-
thers to dominate the rest of the
half. Consistent pressure paid off
with 11:31 left. when Pitt was
awarded a direct free kick because
Dantzig ran the ball out of his
crease.

Pitt used a rehearsed penalty kick
play on which Tom Murphy,
instead of taking the expected shot,
passed left to Nick Chrisanthon,
who put a 10-yarder behind Dant-
zig for his first goal of the season.

"It seemed like a different game
the second half." said Alan Jutca.

For awhile it looked as though Pitt
was going to get blown out of Notre
Dame Stadium. The Irish won the
opening toss but elected to kick off,
and their decision turned out to be,
a smart one as the Panthers went
nowhere. Larry Swider punted to
the ND 46 giving the Irish good
field position for their opening
drive. -

Quarterback Tom Clements dir-
ected an excellent offensive attack
first establishing a running game
with Wayne Bullock, whomanaged
to batter his way through the
Panther defense for 124 yards on 25
carries during the afternoon.
When the Pitt defense slowed the
ground game Clements found Pete
Demmerle along the right sideline
for a 35-yard gain to the Pitt three.

Larry wasted no time getting the
ball into the endzone from there.

On the very next play, he rolled to »

his left and again found Demmerle
alone in the endzone for the
touchdown. Dave Reeve added the
extra point to make the score 7-0
with 9:31 left in the first quarter.

The game then developed into a

Panthers. Randy Garber, who will
be about the first player called by
the Olympic team if Bahr the
Greater turns pro, converted a pass
from Bahr the Lesser into a 4-2 lead
at 6:04 of the half. His shot was a
20-yard bouncer that fooled Bucci.

Ten minutes later, Garber missed
an excellent opportunity: shooting
at a near-empty net, he hit the
goalpost. But he gained his vindi-

cation two minutes later when’

defensive struggle with the two
teams exchanging punts until Pitt
was able to get their first break of
the game. With Tony Brantley
punting from the Irish 25 the entire
Pitt defense, with the exception of
one deep defender, applied the
pressure. Chuck Bonasorte easily
blocked the punt and Ed Wilamow-
ski recovered on the 12-yard line.

The Pantherswere unable to get
into the endzone however despite
moving to a first down on the Irish
one. Tony Dorsett hit the center of
the line on second-and—one and
Kevin Nosbusch knocked the ball
away where defensive back Randy
Payne could recover it.

The Irish once again moved the
ball driving from their own one
down to the Pitt ten yard line with
Bullock eating up big chunks of real
estate: But when Bullock tried the
middle on second-and-five from the
Pitt ten he coughed up the ball into
the hands of Pitt linebacker Kelcy
Daviston.

Pitt failed to move the ball again I
and punted the ball to the Irish.
Two plays later the ball was back in
Panther hands and once again it
was Daviston who forced the
turnover picking off a Clements
pass at the ND 44. , I. M

The next play was tragic from the

SOUTH BEND. Indiana--You can never take satisfaction in losing.

Anybody in sports who takes it seriously can’t maintain any other

attitude and expect to keep his job for long.

And for the Pitt Panthers’ 14-10 loss to the Irish of Notre Dame

Saturday, there was no shame, but no satisfaction either.

There was more on the line than the fabled Liberty Bowl bid if Pitt
could have taken the Irish. The Pitt players were out to prove to about
40.000 ignorant Notre Dame enthusiasts and a few thousand doubting

Pittsburghers that Pitt is more than just Tony Dorsett.

They did it in fine fashion, getting the breaks and making them while
contending with a major injury and what had been forecast as
overwhelming odds. With Billy Daniels out and the threat of Dorsett
relatively nonexistent, the team effort led by reserve quarterback Bob
K/“"'-._\_ Medwid had Notre Dame on the ropes. But as Johnny Majors aptly put

y

it. “We just ran out of time.’

There isn’t really a fair starting point when it comes to handing out
the praises to the Panthers. Medwid’s play can’t be criticized after
coming off the bench into a pressure situation few men could handle.
It’s a strange situation to step into when you haven’t played much for
the balance of a collegecareer and you know you’re only a victim of

circumstance.

putting the ball on the three.
Medwid carried the ball twice on
the option getting into the end zone
on the second attempt. Long's kick
made the half-time score 7-7.
The third ‘quarter was pretty
uneventful from an offensive
standpoint with the defenses taking
over forcing the two teams to rely
on their punting games. Tony

Dorsett was snowed under consis- .

tently by the tough Irish defense as
a second-half-rain and a sore ankle
made it difficult for the sophomore
tailback to gain proper footing on
the soggy natural surface.

Freshman tailback Elliott Walker

the game moving the ball to the ND

more yards, Long boomed the field
goal that gave Pitt the lead.

The Fighting Irish were not to be
denied and finally put together the
winning scoring drive. Bullock was

ball in a cutback against the flow. But there was Murphy once again
handing his coach an excellent performance in the clutch with key
reception after hey reception. .

Don't get me wrong. The last thing I want to sound like is a
cheerleader. But after watching Majors build a.respectable proram in
two years. this game had to be the most electrifying to date.

There were times when some Pitt football games I’ve seen would have
‘ -~-' been better off unwitnessed. Uncontrolled enthusiasm can sometimes

lead to embarrassment when the second half is finally over.

Last year’s losses to Notre Dame and Penn State are prime examples.
Even the last Panthers of Carl DePasqua gave the Irish _a ride for three
quarters and last year’s games with State and’ Notre, Dame were
exciting for a while but anyone who knew anything about football could
have predicted the ﬁnal outcome.

The whole fact is that Majors has begun the foundation for more than
he constructed at Iowa State. The _Liberty Bowl bid doesn’t mean

' ~ anything right now, even if the possibility still actually exists.
if ‘Everyone knows Pitt deserves to be going somewhere and Parseghian
paid his compliments to Majors & Co. after the game quite honestly.

“Everyone seemed to forget Pitt came in here a 7-2 team,"
Parseghian said. “They’re 7-3 now but how many teams in the nation
are 7-3? We studied the films over and over and we knew there would
be no use in keying on Tony Dorsett.

chased down ‘a loose ball about 15

of the goal that made it 5-3. “He .
didn’t expect that, I kept it low, off
to his left." .

Penn State held Pitt at bay for the

them few opportunities to cut the

game on both sides. but PSU,

proved to be too much.

“We’ve got something going
here,” Bemis said, “if we all keep
working on the things we know

1 Pittsburgh.

but Rooney survived.

a, \.

BY DOM GLIOZZI

In the 55 year history of the
National Football League few team
owners have endured as many
years as this man has.

He is Arthur J. Rooney Sr.,
owner, president and father figure
of the (Pittsburgh Steelers since
their. inception. This gray haired,
cigar smoking gentleman is also
known as the kindest, most
charitable owner in sports today.

Rooney's involvement with sports
began when he was a youngster

He and his buddies
would hang around the play-
grounds from sunrise to sunset
playing baseball, basketball or
football, whichever was in season
at‘ the time.

In addition to the usual sports,
each neighborhood had its own
boxing club. Many of the aspiring
young pugilists came directly from
the playgrounds and were quite
naturally ‘good all around athletes.
It was _a semi-tough neighborhood
In fact he
still lives in‘ the same area today.

Rooney’s interest in sports,
football in particular, grew to such

point that he eventually came to -
-‘own-several semi-pro teams in the

Pittsburgh area. In those days the
Pennsylvania “Blue” Laws pre-
vented people from doing much of
anything on Sundays let alone
playing football. ‘

“As long as you didn't belong to
an organized league," said
Rooney, “you weren’t bothered by
playing on Sunday."

Rooney's involvement with the
semi-pro teams came before he
bought the Steelers, but the play
was rough and good." “I had teams
that compared favorably with a
number of the teams in the
National Football League then."

The teams played in such garden
spots as Ft. Wayne, Indiana,
Steubenville, Ohio and Toronto,
Ontario while their nicknames were
originals , like the McKeesport

‘Olympics and the Bradley Eagles.
Rooney’s. teams played home ~

games in old Exposition Park which
ironically enough is the site of
Three Rivers 'Stadium. ,
“Whenever they voted the
‘Blue’ Laws out I just paid $2500
and took a franchise in the National
Football League,” said Rooney and
thus the’Pittsburgh Steelers as we
know them today were born. . ,
“Many college stars didn’t play
the pro game because they could do
better in some other line of
endeavor,” and that according to
‘Rooney was his biggest problem in
the early days of the team. “Now
the salaries are such that it’s hard’
for a college player regardless Of.
what his stature is not to play
professional football.” _
The most enjoyable aspect of
owning a football team? “Win-

p nir_1g,>_it makes you smart, it makes

ART ROONEY SR. --
$2500 franchise

everybody think you know what it’s
all about and it proves you have a
good organization.”

Of course the Steelers are winners
nowbut it wasn’t always that way.
Art Rooney’s team seemed to- lose
more than any other team in the
NFL and had the longest drought in
league history, over 30 seasons
without ‘a championship. “The 6
Chief” as he-is called by his players
describes the frustrations.

“We lost so often that you didn't
feel like_ going out in the daytime.

You ducked your friends. You went ' I

up and down alleys to get to your
office. Everybody asked you the
same thing. What happened?”
Not only did the Steelers lose,
they found ridiculous ways to do so.

out-stII~IIIIII-HII_it...

Steelers, Roy Blount Jr. of Sports
Illustrated proposed this hypothet-
ical story of a Steeler loss in. their
bleaker days.

The Steelers are clinging to a slim

le‘ad with just a -few seconds
remaining in the game. The
Steelers are on defense. The

opposing team has time for what
should be one last play. They run
the play without success and the
clock ticks down, .3, 2,...A Steeler
player is down and out on the field

" and one of the Steeler assistants

mistakenly calls a time out.-.,_instéad
of letting the clock run. This gives
the opposition one more chance
and they, score the winning
touchdown.

“By the time Tuesday comes you
forget all about it and get ready for
the next game!” Rooney said, and
‘ that’s why he never threw in the
towel and gave up. His love and
enthusiasm for the game carried
him through. It might be said then

that patience is one of Art Rooney’s ,

greatest virtues.

That patience has paid off as the
,Steelers wontheir first champion-.
ship in l972.by winning the AFC
Central Division Title, and making_
theplayoffs again. last season. The
Steelers are in the midst of another
winning season and many more are

sure to follow. The long ‘dry spell is -

over and the Steelers are now
established as one of the most
