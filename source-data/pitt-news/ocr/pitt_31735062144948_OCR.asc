{HEREDITY CARRIES.
 ACQUIRED TR-AITS
 .Collins linforins Club-

.'Acqui‘red Characteristics.
-Are Transmittable

 acquired characteristics can

be transmitted. through, heredity was «I

stated by Dr. H. H. Collins, profes-
nor of zoology, to members and
guests of the Hungry Club at a
luncheon, in the Fort Pitt Hotel last
' onday at noon.

“Probably one of the most impor-
tant problems before the scientiﬁc
world today is that of acquired
Characteristics and whether the same
can be transferred through heredity.
The. problems of racial relations
themselves depend primarily upon
this'matter,” said Dr. Collins.

In view of certain discoveries
made by Prof. MacDougall of Duke
University, and other well-known
scientists, there is a possibility that
the abilities and characteristics ac-
quired by one generation may be
passed on through many generations,
finally -coming out as a regular trait
‘or. that family. This theory, how-
‘ever, Dr. Collins pointed out, has not
yet" been accepted by the scientiﬁc
world because of the lack of suf-
ﬁcient‘ evidence.

“ Dr. ‘Collins himself is at present
doing experimental work with re-
spect--to the-regulation of growth
hid form in animals. His investiga-

tions now in progress are partially‘

"suppo by a research grant from
the AI ican. Association for the
Advancement of Science.

, Dr. Alfred E. Emerson, also of the
department of zoology, was chair-
man of the luncheon.

rish, professor of public speaking
and coach of men's debating team,
will preside as chairman. Follow-
ing the ‘formal debate an open forum

sity debating at Pitt. . ‘

The co-ed debating team has al-

fore a home audience’ and another
with the -same team at Cincinnati.
Two debates were also held with
West Virginia, one ‘there and the
other before‘-the League of Women

for debate in these four contests
was "Resolved, that the United
States Should Cease -to Protect by
Force of Arms the Investments-of
its Citizens in Foreign Countries.”

According. to Theresa Kahn, a
member of_the public speaking. de-
partment and co-ed debate-coach, the
women will engage, in two more in-
tercollegiate debates, Oberlin and
Cornell, although a number of_ ex-
tension debates are being arranged
before‘ high schools and various
women’s organizations.

SPEAKER DECLARES
-WRITER Is CREATOR

._—_——,-

 

Former Harvard Teacher
Stresses Man’s Creative
Spirit -
“The architect and the writer
are creators. because the present

educational system has developed -

somewhat the s'ensitivity the
under man,” Dr. , . W. Brown,
former member of the faculty of
Harvard University, stated in his
address on “The Creative Spirit
and the American Publ.ic,”'_ before
the Twentieth, Century‘ club Mon-
day morning. -

The‘ writer lives in a town on

of

Main Street and then writes about _

It, and the result is ‘a- work of ﬁc-
tion, and a work" of art. -‘The ‘car-

toonist and the poetalso have the-.

creative spirit. -All these people
who -are cregtors areﬂin some man-
ner’ detache from “the” world,‘ ‘for
they see‘-it in a diﬁ‘ereht- manner;
Yet they are never wholly o. tim-~
ists-—Pollyannas have a clasp ;..sys-
tem of philosophy which never sees
the rie'w“sides of’ the ‘world, Dr.
Brown stated. » ,

The‘ ﬁrstessentials; of creators is
to believe ‘in’ new .possibilities-; the
second, is an emotional glow; and
the third is the victorious. atti-
tude,  Brown believes: .To the
general public it is not evldentfthat.
some . creators have the victorious
attitude, even an jéfﬁciency ‘expert
would say that they did‘_not_ earn
their salt.. ‘ . . ‘

'¥‘So-called normal. people might
have creative spirit, for to -a certain"
‘extent everybody. is crazy; it de-
pends upon which ‘direction the
phobia takesto show ‘whether it is
progressive" creation or more insan-
ity. Yet' somehow the creator who
makes the liberalizing upheaval is
discouraged and the’ result‘ is to the
detriment of all the people con-
cerned. It is necessary to discover
what creative spirit exists and to
put it‘ to work.”

SPEAKS FOR COAL
I PROBLEM SOLUTION.

Executive Declares Against
' Deriding Labor
.Unions

 

Declaring his purpose was not to
deride labor unions but that he was
seeking to resolve the coal problem
into_ an economic question’, R. Tem-
pleton Smith, secretary-treasurer
andgeneral manager of the Lawber-
Gas Coal Company: and the ‘Ontario
Gas-Coal Com any, addressed mem-
bers of the iberal club at their
ﬁrst dinner meeting at- Zoology Main
Thursday evening. V
‘Smith outlined three major causes
forthecfiresent tie-up in. the bitumi-
nous in ustry. He declared that the
overcapacity of coal pibductioii over-
shadowed, the entire problem. The
fact that more coal was mined than
could be consumed has resulted in
a hea overproduction and the cut
in pr uction to remedy this situa-
tion would cause “somebody to go
out of business,” Smith said. Elec-

tric and oil burning inventions are“

deemed unimportant in causing the
present situation because the Pitts-
burgh coal market has- increased but
the coal to satisfy this new demand
does not come from Pittsburgh
mines, Smith stated.

Railroad rates, discriminatory to
Pittsburgh operators, were discussed
by Smith. He demonstrated by
charts that while Pittsburgh oper-
ators are paying one cent a ton mile
for transportation to lake ports,
southern coal producers -are receiv-
ing this same service at-a-rate-which
allows them to compete-with-the lo-
cal district. “Ninety - per cent -of
the boats that go to lake ports-come
back loaded with ore whichshould
reduce the cost to Pittsburgh-open
ators of this method of transporta-
tion,” stated Smith. He showed
that rates are higher and discrimi-
nate against local operators in favor
of southern competitors.

Taxes were next criticized by
Smith who demonstrated that the
Pittsburgh operator is paying much
higher taxes than his soutlieta com-
petitor. This high tax rate. is due

Wednesday
Consideration of tapping new 1
members, which will probably be

held at the end of this month, and

a deﬁnite changing of the name-of

the organization from Freshmarl

Scholastic Honorary Society to_ Eu-‘
matheia were the essential businesl.
features of the society held at Heinz»

House last Wednesday.

The new name of the organiza-
tion, Eumatheia, is a derivative of
the Greek and ﬁguratively means“
“good at learning." The reason for
the change in name, states C.‘ J.
Phillips, president of the society-
is that the old name was not only
too long, but had no direct appli-
cation to the meaning approved by}.
the ‘Student
states Phillips. 

Eumatheia, was ﬁrst considenegl
last year by the Student Relation-I
Committee as some means of recog-

Had Good Time Here

Many letters have been received
by Chairman W. C. Arther of Alumni
Council and the Secretary regarding
the out-of-town Alumni Conference
in Pittsburgh February 18, all or
them expressing their appredation
of the visit to the University. and
the entertainment arranged in their
honor. Undoubtedly, every alumnus
who attended that affair went home
a, more enthusiastic Pittlte.

Here’: a sample -letter which
comes from Tod F. Busani, Bus. Ad.
'16, who is connected with the*,(iuar-
dian Trust Co., Cleveland,  *

' “Just a word to let you know how.
(Fenjoyed meeting offriends and
former classmates, as well 
ing had the op ortunity to 
-more of what itt is doing and
expects to do in the future. ‘
"After enjoying such a due din-
ner and experiencing such ‘an ex-
citing basketball game, you can be
assured that I will not pass up a
single opdportunity of sa' ‘ng a‘
good war for Pitt and at those
associated with the University.”

 Chicago Luncheons

 

Chicago alumni are having weekly
. luncheons each Monday at Carson's
Grill. Frank Adams, Eng. '06, who
is one of the prime movers’, writes
that the luncheons are going good,
with a new face out every week.
Eleven were out February 29. The
“Chicag _ ,
notice of the luneheons in their daily
column, “What's Doing Today."

We recently ran across
(“Joe”) Gardner, a Pittsburg
nus, who advised us of having been
in Chicago recently and having been
a visitor at the Pitt luncheon.

, Alumni who visit Chicago at any
‘time should plan to attend these
luncheons. Further details can be
furnished by the Alumni Ofiice, or
on arrival at Chicago, they can mm-
municate with Frank N. _Ads_rns or
M. A. Follansbee. Adams is with the

systems of production, the routine

Fruchthandler pointed out.
Fruchthandler entered Pitt in Sep-

“We will not change our policy
and our. mines will continue to run
on the present basis and in no
other way,” said Mr. L. E. Young,
first vice-president of the Pitts-
burgh Coal Company, addressing
members of the Oxford Club last
week. Mr. Youn stated that the
company was gla to have the Sen-
ate make its investigation» and did
not intend to change its present
policy. .

The condition of the mines brought
forth no uncomplimentary remarks
from the Senate committee on Sat-
urday for the company has spent
a sum of money in improving fa-
cilities of the town and improving
structures in the mines, said Mr.
Youn . Quoting ﬁgures, he brought
out at 1,194 employes of the
Pittsbu h Coal Company owned
cars, an 550 cars are driven in by
men who do not live near the
mines. ~

This state of affairs shows that
all the miners are not as poverty-
stricken as the public su poses, the
speaker’ stated. Mr. oung said
there have been many. coin laints
concerning theiiisolence of e po-

 

lice who are the highest type of
moan, many of them having war rec-
or s.

“Notwithstanding this state of
affairs, the United Mine Workers
flatly refuse arbitration,” said
Young. They say, we would rather
settle problems with. men in the in-_
dustry rather than with outsiders.
If we ever get them settled, it will
be done by men on the inside. We
will not vote for a motion that
places the welfare of the miners
and their families in the hands of
a man who may be appointed by_
the chief justice of the . Supreme
court of the United States or
President Coolidge, Young. said.

AIMS AT CHARTS

Introspective Measurements
Object Of‘ Preparing
° ta

For the first time in its history
the department of secondary educa-
tion has issued a list of aims de-
signed to facilitate the student
teacher in measuring his own
growth, according to W. W. D.
Sones, professor of secondary educa-
tion. This list containing a hun-
dred objectives provides students-
with ‘a scale for use in determining
the achievement of these.

So far there has been only one
test made by new teachers, but the
result of ‘this one has been very
gratifying, since the student teacher

has been able to discover his points
of weakness and strength at the out-
set of his work, Dr. Sones points
out. He adds-further that sincethis
new system of self-examination has
been installed more students have
come to him and other faculty mem-
bers with questions concerning‘ in-
dividual needs.

The ability to express wholesome

‘enthusiasm is one of the objectives

named by Dr. Sones. Others are
forc_efu1ness,,'faith.ful enacting of
duties, co-operative ability, openness
to suggestions, appearance, cheerful-
ness and optimism, patience, poise
and self-control, voice development,
friendliness, expression of sincerity
and earnestness in one’s attitude. A
group of objectives concerning the
maintenance, of environment for
learning and teaching is a part of
the hst. Eleven aims in the devel-
opment ‘of efficiency in routine and

 naces instead of Sweet Adeline quartettes, a city where
 a level piece of ground is more precious than

I university’s student body is likely to deﬁne this same
school spirit in unusual terms. At best school ‘
is a vague, jc ne sais quoi sort of thing. Removed rom
its native habitat (usually the small, or at least un-

 

tnd. assumes fantastic forms. _
Out of the East and West come enchanting tales of
‘or hops and class ﬁghts, of raccoon coats and bare
 ds; letters and papers bring news of plus fours,
vi, ' ﬁg sticks, ravishing maids, and Jurgenesque boys.
 se things appeal to the Pittite, and he discusses
them with his fellow students in the smoker of the
Uniontown Express, and the Four Corners Local, He
goes and does likewise; the results are ludicrous. An
old ﬂivver loaded with college boys trundles along in

 

 ~ Ann Arbor or New Haven, and seems to belong there.
 Take the same outﬁt and put it on Smithﬁeld street!

9“ ‘ A raccoon coat in Alumni Hall seems as out of place

.. c‘ and forlorn as a dog without ﬂeas.
2 It is not so much the student who is to blame, for
 he is up against it. His university is right in the center
 ‘ of American industrialism. Instead of walksshagled
by elms and sycamores, he has smokestacks belching
red ﬂame; while others amble leisurely to class, he
’ A . climbs several hundred steps and comes in puffing like
 a winded horse; he eats in a place full of steam and
~ “sounding like a boiler factory; he really must wnlk 1
s mile for a. cigarette. In short, you can’t grow ﬂowers

on a slag pile.

Then, too, your student body is a strange mass. A
good bit of it is composed of commuters, and 9. com-
muter is a very unfortunate person. He must rush

 after trains and street cars to get to school. After
 school he rushes for street cars and trains. Ad inﬁnztun}.
T w The school, instead of being a home for him, as it
should, is a boarding house. The resident student
hemmed in all day in one building and unable to ﬁnd
any natural methods of self-expressmn, goes almost
crazy in order to make himself feel he’s really part of

 

 , the university. Most of the time he goes in for self-
_. ' government. There is a men’s self-government associa-
  tion, which governs the men; there is a women’s self-

government association, which governs the ladies; then _

there is a combination of both, presumably to govern
each other. He also toys with other playthings, which
I can’t understand.

All of which merely proves the major premise of this
s  theme: It’s all a matter of geography. It's idiotic to
* ibecome chauvinistic and bellow in reply, “If you don’t

WHAT OUR

READERS SAY

 

Advocate; Abolition of College
Association Formal

Editor of The Weekly?

Every aemester, at registra-
tion. there ia raised considerable
propaganda concerning member-
ship in the association: of the
students in the various schools
or the university. Every year
since their inception several
semesters ago. attempts are
‘made to make aaaoeiation mem-

. bershipa as nearly 100 per cent

as possible. Appeal it made to
“achool spirit.” Dancer are held
forth as inducement: for loin-
ing. Participation in Pitt Week
has in the past been proclaimed
an argument for membership.
Although the college autocla-
tien had a large membership at
this time last semester, it was

conspicuously noticeable. that
those who belong to the college

association today are much less
in number, due, in more than
one instance, to the  that
the social calendar of the au-
sociation baa not been such as
to  the beneﬁts of
membership among the student
body as a whole. ‘

In contract to the policy 
the business" administration as-
Ioclation, which prepares a pro-
gram lunch more democratic and
economical, the social committee

" “of the college association feel:

obligated to arrange a formal
dance every semester.

In tonne of attendance. the
college association had never
been nearly to successful as
have been the informal social
ailairo. of the same group.
Merely to be members of the
association is "enough of a‘hard-
jallipjor some students ﬁnancial-

‘ ly. 1 There in little justiﬁcatlon

v¢_hy7 the students should be
"privileged" to ‘attend a college
formal when but a amall~minor-
ity of .the7studenta have formal
outllts, and whenxmany‘ of the
other: are. in the; predicament
of either‘ paying for the rental

 of a tuxedo orelse ofpnot at-
, ‘tending anjffalr for which their
t money is being expended. The

-individual expenses offa formal

would easily be two or four
times his expenses "for an in-
formal dance. -13 the college

_ members who", by virtue of fra-
ternity lcontacte, find it urgent
tei own formal attire 1 ,If so,
the reason, for such an'event. is
groundless;

If the college associationpofob

social standards of the average
student, it fails of its purpose,‘
as demonstrated by the rela-
. tively small number of students
attending. Since the beneﬁts of
membership in the association
should be distributed among as
many of its members as possible,
I strongly urgethat a change. be
‘made in our social calendar, and
that the college formal be abol-
ished.

Iftbe social committee of the
college association fails to see
this point. in the light of its im-
portance, I feel. that I have the
right to demand that the ques-
tion of whether a formal dance
be part of our aocialevents, or
whether, it be replaced by an af-
fair of an informal’ nature,
should be determined by. a ref-
erendum of the members of the
college association. It is my
feeling that the formal could’ be
abolished by an overwhelming
return. in favor. of affairs that
are informal. in character.

A MEMBER.

Editor of The Weekly:

The Women's Self-Govern-
"moot Association wishes to
make clear the reason for the
action taken by them in clos-
ing Heinz House to those girls
who are not taking part in
meeting when there is a deﬁ-
nitely acheduled meeting taking
place in the large reception
room in Heina House.

The reason that such a con-
dition prevails is that there is

University. There is bound to

Heinz when there is a group of
girls there at the same time
that I deﬁnite ‘group of people

lit trying to hold an organized
meeting. The W. S. G. A. wish-
es in make clear also that the
girla are only excluded if they
doonot join the group, and that
they are excluded only during
that time.

Kcertalnvyoung scholars, reveling

Right now the pledge believes
that he is on the threshold of
divine brotherhood. When he
crosses that threshold he is more
likely to find a world of assess-
ments, petty jealousies, not a
few enmities, and innumerable
grievances. And the worstof it
is that he pays to get in. 9

serious business of being a uni-

fraternity man. The exasperat-
ing thing is that you cannot
make him understand this for he
is ignorant of what fraternities
are and willglil-rely remain so.
It is an old situation and it
will exist as long as fraternities
continue to function. Those that
are fraternity members know
just what they have and how
much it is worth. Those that
areinot will never know because
they will never be members and
will continue to be miserable, not

' The final week of the dental in-
tex-fraternity basketball s eh s o 11
opens with Alpha Zeta Gamma, the
undisputed master, boasting a score
of four‘ victories and no defeats.

This is agreat average, and the
team has seemed to_ have had very
little difficulty in climbing to their
position. Their passin and shoot-
ing has been far supe r to any of
the other teams. and,‘ unless the
Fates decide differently, the A. Z.

With an attractive card, including
nine home meets and seven away
tilts, drawn up, Harry Peterman,
tennis manager, announces that
preparations for the spring season
are well under way, and that'candi-
dates will be called out the early
part of April.

Workon the new courts, onelat
each end of the sto ‘ium green and
threeon the flat area near the Oil
&. Gas school, has been started.
These courts, numbering ﬁve in all,
will be of the most modern type,
consisting of several special com-
binations of clay, and the French
draining system. There is little?
doubt that they will be the best
equipped courts in collegiate circles.
Peterman says that a new seating
arrangement is being considered
which will enable large crowds to
witness the matches.

Dick Cable, captain-elect of the
1926 team, has returned to school,
and his outstanding ability in net

indications. Quite‘ a few junior ‘ten-

It was an entirel different West
‘Vir inia team t at _faced the
Col ens last Saturday night on the
Mountaineer. ﬂoor. Carlson’s bunch
came out on top- with a 45 to 
count, but it was not until the clos-
ing minutes" of the ame that the
Panthers with their acks to the
.wall, sewed up the old game.

With the Stadvold‘ crew loading
at the half-way mark, 21-18,, the.
Blue and Gold steamroller rallied at
the. beginning of the second Istanza,
and was never out of the lead, the
nging from. two to
nine points. From the first mo-
ment after the Mountaineers gained
the lead in the early moments of the
first period, the crowd never let up
and roared itself hoarse by the time
ten minutes had been played.

It was the stellar play of Gtylp

With W. Va., State

Closing an exceedingly brilliant
season which rivals even the varsity
steam-roller’s, the Pitt Frosh Wlll
meet the Washington and Jefferson
and Penn State first year teams next
week. Both these games will be
played preliminary to the varsity’
tilts. The team goes into these bat-'
ties with great confidence, being
bolstered up by their recent vic-
toriies, together with their past rec-
or .

Closely following their victory a
over Wash-Jeff, the Panther Cubs
overcame the Braddock High var-.
sity last Thursday night at the sta-.
dium, 30-17. Getting away to an
early‘ start, the Blue and Gold held‘
the igh hand throughout the entire
game. Never once was their su-
premacy even threatened. The team,
after succeeding to gain a margin
of twelve points by the end of the
half, seemed a little over-conﬁdent
when they jog d onto the floor. The
scoring show that they were, but
not too over-conﬁdent, for without
much effort they managed to hold
their opponents to only ten more
points, while they rang up eleven.

Baker led the home team with four
ﬁeld goals to his credit, and Milt led
the visitors with three. Aiello, Co-
hen and Baker played the best all-
around game for the Panther while
Milt and Brown represented the
Braddock team the most adequately.
The game was good; it was fast and
was ﬁlled with good playing and
good sportsmanship. With this laurel
added to the crown of the Panther
Cubs, there seems little doubt but
that they will come back twice next

Zehfuss made way ’ Les Cohen’
while Fox substitut . for Jimmy

service far before the referee’s ﬁnal ‘

whistle blew.

Jimmy Black, riding on the bench
in the early stages of the game be-
cause of an injury, was ﬁnally in-
jected into the lineup and proved
the star for the locals. He sank two
beauties from the center of the ﬂoor
and wound up with a foul which
accounted for the Mountaineer be-
ing right on Pitt's heels.

Captain Taylor was the high
scorer for Stadvold’s dribblers. He
‘accounted for four-two-pliers and a
comp throw for a total of 11 points,
nine points less than Hyatt, the
leading scorer for Carlson’s Tribe.

Sykes Reed” and Specks Rad-
cliffe went to the showers before
the first half was up via the per-
sonal foul route.

Win Home Final

Grove City, with Coach Bob
Thorns at the helm, blew into the
Stadium for the final home game at-
traction‘ of the local basketball
schedule. They blew back to Grove
City that same Thursday night on
the rear end of a 27-54 score. The
Grovers, led by Bob Angelo of the
McKees Rocks Angelos, proved the
visitors’ sensation of the evening.

The Crimson and White appeared
on the ﬂoor, actually, with the idea
that they were going to put Pitt
down for the count. Gillium, six

land a half-foot captain of the de-

feated brigade is the tallest man
who has appeared on the local ﬂoor
this season. But despite the
heighth of this man Gyp Wunder-
lich continually outjumped and out-
played his tall 0 ponent.

It was somewhat of a surprise
that the Carlson steamroller rang
up as many points as it did. Grove
City has always boasted of a power-
ful team and have been a jinx to the
Panthers on many occasions. Very
few teams have ever been able to
defeat Thorne’s crew as badly as
Pitt did last Thursday night.

The foul shooting" of Stash Wro-
bleski was the high light of the eve-

ning. We lost track of the number 4

of free throws after the sterling
guard dropped in six. .

As the curtain of the 1928 aquatic‘

undefeated
Last fall there was a nu-

Corr was to build his 1928 tank

record of this undefeated team, he

troup of Golden mermen is Cap-

tire season without the slightest
scratch on his clean slate, besides
being rated among the best inter-
collegiate sprinters. He has estab-
lished two tank records at Trees
pool: 19 seconds ﬂat for the 40-

for the 100-yard event. Bus has
won similar laurels at the Army and
Carnegie Tech pools. Wright gradu-
ates this June, and his loss will leave
‘a big gap in the Blue and Gold team
next year.

Along with Wright, Albert Mango
has kept a steady ,-pace, defeating
his opponents in . the back-stroke
event with utmost ease. Al has a
mark of 1:48 for the 150-yard
back-stroke at Trees pool, and holds
a record of 1:08 for the 100-yard,
back-stroke event at the Wooster’
tank.’ Al will be _the_ main cog of
next dyear’s sp_lashers,,who, with the

strength of this year’s yearl-
ing outﬁt. have a bright outlook.

Meet Carnegie

the Panther splashers is‘ Wednes-
dayevening, "March 14, at Trees
pool, when the Pitt team will ‘en-

Carnegie "Tech. ' Althoughthii meet

uled on the o'ﬂi_'cial list, the‘ swim-
’mers will participate in several ‘A.

this yicinity. Among ‘these are’ in-
cluded the P.‘ A. C. meet, to be‘ held

the contest ,a,t_: the McKeesport‘ “Y,”
