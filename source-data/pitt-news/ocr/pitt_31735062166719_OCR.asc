,8 Panthers Upset Wisconsin,

MADISON, Wisconsin ——
Theres’ quite a difference
between a winner’s and los-
er’s dressing room. There's
shouting, laughter, and coke in-
stead of guilty whispers, bowed
heads, and swollen eyes. And
after nine straight losses, the
Panthers ﬁnally had a chance
to shout when they beat Wis-
consin, 13-11, here Saturday.

When a team wins, everyone’:
a hero. Many players contri-
buted to Pitt's first road victory
since 1964.

There was Bob Bazylak, who
wrote a storybook script by com-
ing out of the locker room at
halftime and completing 12 of
18 passes for 175 yards. Bazy-
lak called his own plays on both
touchdown drives, improvising
with his receivers as he went
along.

“It would have been wrong to
interfere with him,” said a smil-
ing coach Dave Hart. “The whole
team seemed to pick up after
he went in. Maybe it was the
seniors who wanted so badly to
give Baz his chance.”

Hart was referring to seniors
like Bob Longo. Longo caught
seven passes as he broke the
Pitt record for most receptions
in a career. “Baz ha-d Longo all
pepped up,” Hart said. Longo
couldn’t say enough about Bazy-
lak’s quarterbacking. “He made
possible the sideline catches I
had, and did you see how he put
t.he ball between those three de-
fenders on that curl pattern?

“He was perfect out there,"
Long concluded.

“When we started hitting Bob-
by,” Hart explained, “their de-
fense began loosening up. They
were so loose we could hit Joe
McCain when they doubled and
tripled covered Longo. The_y
were so loose that our runs

worked and our draws worked.”

Hart had devised a wingback
offense for Wisconsin which the
Panthers had not shown in any
of their previous games. McCain
broke loose for 34 yards in three
Carries in addition to his six
receptions for 104 more.

Ironically, part of the ration-
ale behind installing the wing
offense was to enable Bazylak,
as the wingback, to throw off of
it on an option.

In addition to the offensive
innovations, Hart successfully
gambled with wide open foot-
tall. Mickey Depp sliced an on-
side kick into the arms of Terry
Hoover to open the game with
the Panthers in the right frame
of mind. Jeff Barr and then
Bazylak t.hrew on ﬁrst down
and found it proﬁtbale against
the weak Badger secondary.

The offensive line gave the
quarterbacks time to throw. All
ﬁngers after the game were

pointed at Frank Pecman and
Tom Mitrakos. “They did it for
us," said fellow lineman Ari
Alois. “We worked on protec-
tion all week," said Hart, “and
it paid off."

After four straight comple-
tions to start the second half,
Bazylak called for George Prib
ish on the draw. “He saw how
they were set up for it,” smiled
Hart. Pribish cut back through
a gaping hole and went 12 yards
untouched for the Panthers’ ﬁrst
score.

Minutes later, Bazylak drew
Wiscons=in offside with a long
count for a ﬁrst down on the
two and Jeff Brown, playing his
ﬁrst game at fullback, bulled
over from the one to give the
Panthers a 13-3 lead.

Now the defense had some-
thing to ﬁght for. Earlier in the
game, the goal line unit had
forced the Badgers to fumble
on the one yard line. Dave Diab

 

bley, who played an “extremely
sharp game,” according to de-
fensive coach Bill Nead, had re-
covered to end the threat.

A little later, George Rich-
ards. playing in his ﬁrst game,
intercepted the ﬁrst pass by a
Panther linebacker in two years.
“Our linebacking was just amaz-
ing,” exuberated Neal. ‘We had
people: who had never played
there before doing a heck of a
job.”

The defense -came through-in
the last quarter. Tackles Dave
Drake and Ed Whittaker p-ut the
pressure on Wisconsin's quar-
terback John Ryan. Faced with
a fourth down and 14 and less
than a minute left, Ryan heaved
a desparaitio-n pass which Dib-
bley intercepted.

The Panther bench had to
wait 37 more -seconds before
they could mob Hart and Bazy-
lak and -charge into -that rolairi.-ng
dressing room.

Admiral True Declares U.S.
Defends Petty Dictatorships

by IVAN ABRAMS

“The holy fabric of free-
dom is threadbare,” declared
Rear Admiral Arnold E.
True speaking at last Thurs-
day’s speakout against the
war in Vietnam. “Instead of
support of . a free world, as
we claim to be our rationale

behind our Vietnam involve- -

ment, the United States has be-
come the defender of petty dicta-
torships throughout the world.”

Examples -of these totalitari-
an regimes, according to Ad-
miral True, are Vietnam, “where
considerable evidence exists that
pressure was brought on the

peasants to vote for the Thieu-
Ky ticket”; Greece where a mil-

- itary junta has overthrown a

legally elected government and
“we don’t seem to be overly dis-
turbed”; Taiwan, controlled by
the iron hand of Generallisimo
Chiang Kai-Shek and his AlIT1€'I'-
ican-trained secret police; and
Haiti, the plantation of “Pappa
Doc” Francois Duvalier.

“Its closer to the truth that
the foreign policy of the United
States has been support of any
government in the world op-
posed to Communism, no mat-
ter what the wishes of the peo-
ple or the conditions in the
country,” decried Admiral True.

Interfaith Marriages

Rubenstein Discusses Marriage

by ANNE DORN
. At a B’nai B’rith Hillel
brunch yesterday, Dr. Rich-
ard Rubenstein discussed the
psychology of inter-faith
marriage. “The marital deci-
sion is the most important
single decision a person can
make,” he stated. “I am con-
vinced that a marriage between
two healthy people of the same
religious background is best."
Dr. Rubenstein told the group
that the interfaith marriage
problem is the “predominant
problem” he faces in nine out of
ten cases. We never know why
we select our marriage partners.
The reasons are infinitely com-
plex. The decision is the most
emotionally over-determined one
-that we make in our lives.’’
Because of these complexities,
Dr. Rubenstein feels that both
partners should follow the same
religion. He emphasized that
this belief was not one of prej-
udice. but of .“the better part of

wisdom." He stated that there
are two religious and social
structures in the United States
with which a person may iden-
tify. To avoid the personal re-
ligious conﬂict and the social
conﬂict, “I personnailly feel it is

 of the same religion.”

 

better for people of the same
religion to marry.”

As for the problem of inter-
dating, Dr. Rubenstein advised
against that also. “One can nev-
er tell if a chance date can blos-
som. After all, people aren't
made out of wood.”

Dr. Rubenstein analyzed the
problem of intermarriage. “When
a man marries outside of his
religion, he is looking for some-
one who doesn't remind him of
his mother. There is an instinc-
tive conﬂict that all men fear
when it comes to choosing a
marriage partner. Intermarriage
stems from conditions that have
occured long before the actual
decision to marry.”

He offered some words of ad-
vice to the females in the au-
dience. “The legitimate object of
every girl in college is to ﬁnd
a husband. Dating is a business.
Girls will never have another
opportunity of four years of
casual acquaintances with boys

national security is at stake, in
Vietnarn, Admiral True, a grad-
uate of the Naval War College,
said, “there is absolutely no
danger of North Vietnam at-
tacking Los Angeles, and only
if we keep sticking pins in Chi-
na will she attack us.”

Depcloning that anticommun-
ism has become the fanatics-m
of American foreign policy, Ad-
miral True said that if we hope
to win the hearts and the minds
of the Vietnamese people we
must -not continue the use of
military force.

“Each time a village is bomb-
ed by American planes, more
people join the Viet Cong,” he
said.

Admiral True cited the Gene-
va Accords of 1954 to show that
the Vietnamse war is in reality

a civil war.” There is no 1’ounda- .

tion for two states in Vietnam,
and if there aren't two «states
you can’t have aggression of one
state against another,” he point-
ed out.

Admiral '1‘-rue feels that it is
far better to pull out of Viet-
nam than to continue pouring
men, machinery, and money
into Vietnam. “Vietnam  a
sympton of a chronic disease in
our foreign policy,” he said,
"and we must reverse this trend
before it's too 1ate.’’ /

Following Admiral Trrue’s
speech was a message from
General Hugh B. Hester, US
Army (retired), read by Dr. Ray
Richmam of the University. Gen.
Hester termed the Saigon gov-
ernment “quislings” -and called
for a stop to the “Johnson ad-
minismraltions naked war of ag-
gression."

Schlesinger Reports

Johnson Sure To Run
For Re-election In ’68

by DAN BOOKER -

A press. conference can be a harrowing experience.

Reporters, eager pencils poised over pocket notebooks, fire

sometimes unexpected questions requiring extemporaneous

answers. Television cameras, with the inevitable bright

lights, capture every movement and microphones every
word. _

Add to this the supposed penchant of the press to pick up
slogans, oversimplify qualiﬁed statements, and just plain mis-
interpret information. The sum of these factors can be a harrow-
'ing experience. '

But, take a -subject at a news conference who is conﬁdent in

his opinions, Ia subject whose attitudes are backed by years of
academic discipline. llt helps too if the subjects personal manner
prohibits the loss of his “cool." Finally, add years of experience
teaching college students whose sometimes unexpected questions
require extemporaneous answers.

The result is a relaxed, informal atmosphere where reporters
get forthright answers on all questions.

This was «the result Wednesday in a ppre-lecture press con-
nferenoe with Arthur Schlesinger, J'r., noted historian and former

advisor to President Kennedy.

‘Schlesinger made it clear that he thought Lyndon J ohnso-n
would run for reelection in 1968. He added, though, that if the

‘ Vietnam war is still going on and if the Republica-ns offer a “ra-

tional” candidate, Johnson will lose.

The historian explained that a “rational” candidate would be
an- “anti-escalation” candidate. “Johnson doesn’t even have full
support in his own party,” remarked Schlesinger, “the majority
of Democrats are now anti-escalation.”

On Oct. 8, Schlesinger stated that the country, “if it is to save
itself,” requires new leadership. Here, he said, “It has been a
disaster ‘pursuing the present policy that in two. years and eight
months has gotten us nowhere. To pursue escalation to the limits
would mean. World War III,” he emphasized.

“I advocate -a -slowing down of the war, while maintaining
our military presence as long as is necessary -to bring about a
negotiated settlement,” said Schlesinger. “All escalation does is
elevate the stalemate.” _

Questioned whether Robert Kennedy would run for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination in 1968, Schlesinger remarked that
it would be “unrealistic of anyone to try to keep an incumbent
from running if he really wants to.” He added, “There is about
six per cent chance of Johnson not running.”

Schlesinger ran through these questions with newscasters

from each of the city's three television stations. He had gone

through the same ordeal the night before at Clarion State Col-
lege and was headed for -more of the same that night at Chatham

College.
Repitition also helps make press conferences run smoother.

Montoya’s Virtuosity Landed

by FRANK COUVARES

Flamenco is an emotional
music, its origins lost some-
where back in its Spanish,
gypsy, and Moorish past. Its
beauty lies in its ability to
encompass so many chang-
ing moods, such diversely in-
tense passions, with direct-
ness and compression of
form. Carlos Montoya plays
Flamenco guitar, and last Sat-
urday night at Carnegie Hall.
he performed over 20 numbers
with virtuosity that seems to be
a requisite for adequate inter-
pretation -of such music as Flam-

enco. g
This reviewer cannot avoid
the comparison of Flamenco
with American folk blues gui-
tar music. Both are direct ex-
pressions of individual emotion,
highly rhythmic, employing bas-

‘ ically simple form-s, around

which are built inﬁnite varia-
tions and subtleties by means of
virtuoso vperformance -and im-
pro-vization. We can hear, some-
times, vague hints of the Hat-
picking of Doc Watson, or the
allternating bass of Negro blues
artists like Mississippi John

. Ha-rt, in the playing of Montoya.

But the comparison should
not «be stretched. Similar as they
are, their origins and culutral
roots. «are vastly different, and
t:hey express human experiences
which are very far apart and
unalike.

Montoya played the tradition-
al Flamenco forms-Seguiyiras.
Fandango, Zambra, Malaguena,
Farruca—with consumate mu-
sicianship, i.e., his command of
his instrument is such that he
accurately realizes in sound the
emotions he wishes to communi-
cate. Each piece is an original
interpretation of a traditional
form,» incorporating whatever

new feeling Montoya brings to
bear on it, often spontaneously.
There was the incredible lyric-
ism in the Fandango and Ale-
grias, the catchy joyfulness of
the Fiesta and Chuﬂa, the mur-
ky pathos of the Malaga.

Throughout the concert, Mon-
toya’s technical ability was stun-
ning. Numerous times he exe-
cuted a long, tricky run With-
out picking, using only his left
hand to both press the notes
and produce -sound. Frequently,
he would pick out a melody in
the bass and ma-inta‘in a cor.-
trazpuntal accompaniment in the
treble string (a reversal of the
easier, more common patter -
melody in -the treble, with al-
ternating bass).

I-I-is rhythmic manipulation
was again dazzling. The best ex-
ample was the Soleares, in which
he laid down one rhythm with
his right -thumb, another with

his ﬁngers against the has 84-‘

 The Panthers finally tasted victory after nine succesive defeats. De-

fying the odds, they defeated the Wisconsin Badgers by a score of 13-11.
However, the score is of little significance in this case; what does matter
is that our team successfully rallied in the face of the countless obstacles

in its path.

Although the Panther win marked the end of a nine—game losing
streak, we cannot realistically evaluate it as the beginning of a new era
for University football. For we are now pitted against the top teams in
the country, and the schedule alone is defeating. Also, a high percentage
of the teams we play ‘have more flexible academic standards, which seem-
ingly is a necessity these days for maintaing a top calibre football team.

The importance of having a winning football team can never be over-
estimated. When the current senior class members were seniors in high
school, the Panthers amassed a 9-1 record, ranking third in the country.
Since that time, we have experienced nothing but losing seasons, raising

questions other than those directly concerning the team.

At the Chancellor’s Student Affairs Advisory Committee meeting
last Tuesday, Chancellor Posvar asked the participating students how they
would react to seeing the Panthers play in the proposed Northside Sta-
dium rather than Pitt Stadium. The students unanimously rejected this
suggestion, but the point was made that next year’s class might not be so

swch as a football stadium and a Winning team. With more of our popula-

tion being commuting students, a more impersonal atmosphere has per-

vaded countless aspects of University life. If pressure were successfully
applied upon our University’s administrators and we consented to rent the
N orthside Stadium for our football games and use the space now occupied
for Pitt Stadium for other buildings, wouldn’t we be losing something im-
possible to regain?

Apathy has become an accepted fact around the University these
days, but this does not mean that student apathy has to be sanctioned.
Rather, it should be combatted, and one formula to achieve this is a win-
ning team playing on ourgcampus, not at a stadium a bus ride away.

Fortunately, prospects for the future are encouraging. This year’s

Recently The Pitt News
has expressed concern with

~ the housing situation in the
area. Is this situation just
a manifestation of the can-
cer that is blighting the en-
‘ tire area? Are the streets
well enough lit? Is police
protection adequate? Where
are the beat policemen who
should patrol the area?

I realize that the girl who
was murdered was not from
the University, but I feel
that this occurrence affects
the University as a Whole.
The administration has low-
ered its credit requirements
for girls who want to live
off‘ campus. Now We must
ask how wise is it to allow
19 year old women to live
in the Oakland area, either
alone or with a roomate?
I am not questioning the
ability of a sophomore wo-
man to live off—campus, ra-

drunk who may wander
from one of the multitude
of local bars. This is the
real problem.

This is not idle gossip. In-
cidents have occurred when
men and boys have entered
homes and fraternity hous-
es and severely harrassed
the occupants. One time a
police dog was obtained to
help protect a group of’
men, not because they were
incapable of iwarding off
strangers, but because
chains and pipes are quite
convincing weapons when
they are used against you.

One thing that could help
ease the women’s housing
situation is to obtain sev-
eral large old homes in the
area. These can be used as
roomi:ng houses in which
girls have cooking privileg-
es and-private or double
rooms. Each house should
have a house mother and
some janitorial help. In this
way girls can live out of the
dorms, in campus housing,
and yet have protection,
convenience and freedom.

These are the questions
and some of the answers.
Now the students and the
University must go on from
here.

March on Washington Planned

A Moral Decision

by Hobart Harris

There is going to be a national march on Washington
this Saturday to protest the war in Vietnam. It is mo-st
important that University people go. The honor, the pride,
and perhaps, the very lives of our generation are riding on
this demonstration and others like it.

Bulses have been chartered to take‘University students
to Washington. The fare for the round trip, departing at
5 p.m. Saturday and returning at 11 p.m., is $10. Reserva-
tions can be made at the Student for Peace literature tables
at the ground floor of the Cathedral A limited number of
free rides are available.

Many of us, probably a majority, do not like the war.
But aside from taking verbal potshots at it from the safe
confines of our dorm rooms or our girlfriend's arms, we do
very little. For some reason or other, we seem; to have rele-
gated the act of protest to people with beards and ‘bed com-
plexions, and then proceeded to ostracize them. Students
For Peace has been relegated to a sort of janitorial position
on our campus, performing useful but highly distasteful
work, and allowed to fade into the woodwork at nightfall.
This has got to stop.

We have ‘to realize "that our fate is in our own hands,
that the man who is elected to the Presidency next year may

. be the last human being whose flesh and blood is between

ourselves and death. It is that simple, because it is you and
I that will have ‘to fight this war, that it is you and I who
will have the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people on
our hands, who will have to burn the villages, defoliate the
fields, pull the triggers. ,

President Johnson is not going to be pressured into
stopping the war. That much is obvious. But there is going
to be an election next year, and a primary before it. If this
march, and marches like it can convince a significant por-
tion of the American people that there is justice and truth
in the Peace position, then there will have to be a Peace
candidate in the election. By this, I don’t mean a wooly-eyed
idiot, but a man who can sit down and say t-o himself that
this war is not in our national interest and should be
stopped. '

Men like Gavin, Percy, and Kennedy are waiting for us
to show them our support. If we do, they'll go out and sup-
port us. It’s your life and your conscience.

Cornell Disciplinary Authority

0 Group Urges Change

ITHACA, N.Y. (CPS)—A
special commlissli-on at Cor-
nell University has recom-
mended that the university
give up its law enforcement
activities on campus, and re-
strict its disciplinary «authority
over students “solely to acts of
misconduct damaging to its (the
university’s) educational objec-
tives.”

Previously, the university has

.‘.,,he1p local law-enforcement au-

thorities apprehend law-break-
ers at Cornell, particularly mari-
juana users.

The commission’~s lengthy re-
port, also called for .a g-reater
student voice in disciplinary mat-
ters on campus.

Now that the report has been
made public, there will probably
be several months of discussion
and debate on campu-s before
faculty, administration and stu-
dent groups put its recommen-
dations to a vote. There are al-
ready indications, however, that
some parts of the report face
tough sledding.

On the question of marijuana,
the commission found that “the
behaviour and attitudes accom-
panying student use of marij-
usana” were damaging to the
university’s educational environ-
Inenst, and that therefore the
university should have regula-
tions against -the “possession,
use or sale” of it.

In the view of David Radin,
editor of the Cornell Daily Sun.
such a marijuana policy would
be in some ways a retrogression
from the previous policies.

“It appears to me,” said Radin,
“that the commission approach-
ed the issue with the idea that

. marijuana had to be kept off

campus.” He added that the Sun
would deﬁnitely come out
against that part of the report.

Another of the commission’s
recommendation’s that may
come in for criticism is the one
calling for faculty review of

certain cases adjudicated by the
student’s Conduct Board. Ac-
cording to the report, the fac-
ulty board should be able to re-
view the student 'board’s deci-
sions under “extraordinary cir-
cumstances,” when it is neces-
sary to “rectify any gross mis-
-carriage of justice.”

Radin says that the faculty
should not «be able to initiate
such a review. He believes the
faculty should review only those
cases that are appealed by de-
fendanrts.

Radin praised some parts of
the report, particularly the sec-
tion that recommends an end to
university handling of civil cases
involving students.

“This means that a student
who gets arrested for being
drunk downtowrn won’t have his
case turned over to the univer-
sity,” Radin explained. He’ll have
to go to court. It ends the priv-
ileged position of students.”

The commission, which in-
cludes facuity, adrninistration
and student representatives, was
set up last spring after months
of growing student unrest over
the administration’s disciplinary
policies.

General Electric is made up of a lot more than just
engineers—- because it takes a lot more than engi-
neers to tackle the problems we deal with. Like
helping to unsnarl tratiic jams in our cities, ﬁght-
ing air pollution or ﬁnding new ways to provide
power for underdeveloped nations. It takes sociol-
ogists, meteorologists, astronomers, writers--in
fact, it takes people with just about every kind of
training. But, more than any of this, it takes people

with nerve, gumption, intellectual curiosity-
people who care about what happens to the world.
So it’s not only your major we’re interested in.
It’s you. Why not see our interviewer when he
comes to campus and ﬁnd out whether you’re the
kind of person General Electric is made of.

WASHINGTON (CPS)—--
State support of higher ed-
ucation has more than trip-
led in the last eight years.

But it still may not be
enough to meet expanding
needs.

M. M. Chambers, a professor
at Indiana University who
watches the Way state legisla-
tures treat higher education,
says state appropriations for op-
erating colleges and universi-
ties have increased 214 per cent
in eight years—from $1.5 billion

‘ in 1959-60 to $4.4 billion this
year. He also says that the in-
crease is 44 per cent above the
$3 billion appropriated in 1965-
66.

His report was issued by the
Office of Institutional Research
(OIR) of the National Associ-aw
tion of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges. The report
deals only with state tax appro-
priations for operating expenses
of higher education. It does not
include other income, such as
from student fees, or tax appro-
priations for buildings.

In spite of -the big increases,
both Chambers and OIR direc-
tor Edwin M. -Clnawford warned
that many states with big in-
creases still have not caught up
with the rest of the nation and
that all states will h-ave to ap-
propriate even greater sums to
meet the increasing demands of
higher education.

The report cities population’

growth, enrollment growth, in-
creased sgnaduate -study, infla-
-‘tion, rising faculty salaries, and
expensive new equipment as
reasons for the ‘big increases.

cent), Hawaii
Kentucky (397 per cent), Massa-
chusetts (374 per cent), Connec-
ticut (337 per cent), Rhode Is-
land (311 per cent), Alaska (308
per cent), Tennessee (279 per
cent), and North Carolina (275
per cent).

Yet Crawford cautions that
“many states which ap-pear to
be doing all they can for higher
education must manage to dou-
ble or triple their efforts.” He
says that some states, especially
in the East, st-ill lag far behind
the rest of the nation in over-
all support.

For example, Massachusetts.
which had the ﬁfth largest in-
crease over an eight year per-
iod and is second in two year in-
creases with 80 per cent, still
trails every other state in per
capita support of higher educa-
tion, the proportion of residents
to whom public higher educa-
tion is available, and the propor-
tion of high school graduates
who go on to college.

New York, however, remains
the recognized leader in state
Funds for higher education.
Chambers calls it “a leading ele-
ment in the great surge of rec-
ognition and for support for
public higher education in the
whole "Northeastern region.”
And New York has been con-
sidering elilninating tuition.

Thou gh several Southern states

bama, and Mis-silslsippi, are

crease, they_ are still not closing

tion. -takes larger steps f0r'Wa.rd,”

The report also makes no
comparisons between what is ac-
tually appropriated and what is
requested. Though university
requests may be somewhat in-
ﬂated, as are most requests
from state agencies, many states
with fairly large increases still
make big cuts in what higher
education says it needs. In Cali-
fornia a.nd Michigan, to take
two examples, governors and
legislators combined to cut deep
into. budget requests from ma-
jor universities.

Crawford also attacks “the an-
nual wave of announcements of
tuition increases designed to
compensate for deﬁcits created
by cuts in university budgets”
as “a dangerous threat to the
American commitment to low
cost educational opportunity.”
He cites California, Florida, Ohio,
Michigan, New Hampshire, and
New Mexico as states where
tuition or fee increases have
been proposed or approved be-
cause of cuts in state funds.

The same factors which re-
sulted in the large increases in
ap-propritaions over the last
eight ye-ars will require states
to continue to step up their sup-
port of higher education.

For example, enrollments in
colleges and universities total
6.5 million this year but are ex-
pected to increase «another three
million by 1975. And state in-
~stitu.tions are expected to con»
tinue to have bigger enrollment
increases than the private
schools.

Faculty salaries must contin-
ue to rise at an even higher
rate, Crawford says, though the
average salary for a full pro-
fessor has increased from $11,
295 to $15,028 in ﬁve years. He
notes that faculty salaries at
public institutions still trail pri-
vate schools by an average $2,-
362.

And, despite the increases,
state funds are declining as a
percentage of the income of
many public universities, as the
federal share rises. Crawford
says that state tax dollars ac-

tu-ally provide an average of
only 40 per cent of “state” uni-
versity budgets.

Chambers also attacked the
“vague and uninformed intima-
tions” that the growing needs of
higher education “can -be quick-
ly countervailed by ‘the econo-
my of scale,’ as would occur in
a factory producing standard
bolts; or by huge increases in
the student-teacher ratio, aided
by motion pictures and televi-
sion; or by forcing students to

 album releases by Joan Baez
 and Peter, Paul and Mary

quite a struggle to survive.

Some folk performers, like
those mentioned above are par-

the transition or have conﬁrmed

Makes Needed Adjustments

by RONALD A. DOWNEY

Robert S. Dilley, instructor in Geography at the Uni-
versity, finds himself making a lot of adjustments these
days. Dilley, who arrivedin the United States for the first
time at the end of August, is a young Londoner, about six
fe-et tall, light-haired without a Beatle—13ike haircut, and
quick of speech. He took his undergraduate degree in Geog-

S -raphy at Cambridge University. He left England to work toward a

doctorate, teach, and “ﬁnd out what America is like.”
The ﬁrst adjustment he has had to make is to the difference in

curriculum. As he said, “In most

I _ British universities students take

-courses only in their major sub-
ject, with possibly a few related
courses.” Besides, this, he -said
that there were few lecture
courses, most being of the “pri-
vate conisultation” type.
Another needed adjustment is
the one to the American exam-

The University, along with

of Carnegie - Mellon University,

Cnatnam College, and Mount
Mercy College are combining
faculty strength to conduct a.
«tealchin-g and research program
in comparative Communism.

”'The project is made possible by

a gra-nt from the Carnegie Cor-
poration of New York.

The courses are divided into
three disci~plines: Economics,
History, and Political Science.

Dr. Janet Chapman and Dr.

insati-on system. Dilley ‘pointed
out that “in British universities
the threeyear undergraduate de-
gree is taken in two parts, and
is acquired by passing two sets
-of comprehensive exams and
submitting a written disserta-
tion. One set is take-n at the end
of the second year, the other at
the end of the last year. The
dissertation is written during
the third year and handed in at
the end.”

The format of the British
exam is also quite different, as,
according to Dilly, each of the
written exams consists of seven
papers, each three hours long
The grading of the exams “is
never done by the student’s own
professor, but instead by other
members of the faculty, and
sometimes by professors from
other universities.”

Another major difference be-
tween the two ssytems is that
—intercollegiate athletics is a min-
or -element in the British sys-
tem. Dilley remarked that,
“There are no athletic scholar-
ships for English students.

Folk Takes New Direction

bum, Joan (Vanguard —— VSD-
79240), borrows the Folk Rock
style in many of her selections.
She not only shows her ability
t.o keep up with the times but
shows her great versatility as
well. Peter Shickele’s ﬁne or-
chestral arrangements greatly
enhance the album’s selections,
but never overshadow Miss Baez’
vocal talents.

The recording includes very
credible versions of Lennon and
McCartney’s Eleanor Rigby,
Paul Simon’s Dangling Conver-
sation, and Tim Hardinls If I
Were a Carpenter. Miss Baez
introduces two new selections
that are particularly outstand-
ing. La Colombe (The Dove),
an emotional French anti-war
number, illustrates this perfect
I:-lending between singer and or-
chestra. Annabel Lee, the Ed-
gar Allen Poe poem put to mu-
sic by Don Dilworth, exhibits
Miss Baez’ extremely wide vocal
range and deft interpretation of
a classic work.

Peter, Paul and Mary also in-
troduce music with a beat in
their new release, Album 1700
songs, their latest hit, I Dig
(Warner Brothers——1700). Two
Rock and Roll Music and Roll-
ing Home are -done in the rock
idiom, quite successfully I might
add. Other numbers contain in-
strumental backgrounds, elec-
tronic effects as well as the fa-
miliar guitar accompaniment.

Included are ﬁne solo perform
ances by Mary in Leaving on a
Jet Plane, Paul in The House
Song, -and Peter in If I Had
Wings. Two exceptional num-
bers demonstrate the group’s
success with new material. Pe-
ter Yarrowis The Great Mandel-
la, as song about »a paciﬁst in a
war-hungry World, I think is ex-
tremely -effective. Whatsher-»
name, written and soloed by
Paul Stookey, is a sentimental
song in the popular viain about
the girl we leave behind but
never entirely forget.

Peter, Paul, and Mary h-ave
experimented with new techni-
ques in their 1as:t few albums,
but Album 1700 is the furthest
indication of this change thus
far. The instrumental back-
grounds, and in some numbers,
a rock beat only heighten Peter,
Paul, and Mary's talents and do

not detract from their perform-

ance in the least.

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor
Shocked by Slippery Rock’s last minute tying goal last
Saturday, the soccer team encounters a veteran Grove City
team at Forbes Field, tomorrow at 3:30 p.m.
“Grove City? They’re always tough for us,” said Leo Bemis.
who had his 75th win as head soccer coach Saturday until . . .
Exactly one minute, two se-conds remained i-n -the game, and

the booters had their first vic-
tory of the season, 1-0. The win
would be the twelfth in 14 games
with Slippery Rock, thought the
booters.

While they daydreamed about
their first win, however, Slip-
pery Rock’s inside right John
Matis ran by fullback Mike
Schalk, and slipped the ball past
an on charging goalie Len Har-
mon to tie the score.

“It was just a matter of him
getting a step on our fullback,”
reasoned Bemis. “The goalie had
thought the fullback was»n’t go-
ing to catch him, and came out
of the goal to play him man to
man.”

“Len still doesn’t know how
the ball got under him,” Bemis
remarked. Matis, Schalk, and
Harmon all collided as the ball
rolled slowly into the right side
of the nets, sending the game in-
to overtime.

The Slippery Rock goal re-
sulted from the soccermen’s at-
tempt to hold a 1-0 lead in the
final twenty minutes of play.
The booters‘ score, only the sec-
ond in five games, came in the
third period.

At 6:31 Gary Foertsch, accept-
ed a pass from Bob Quinlan in
the corner, and pushed through
two defenders to score against
Rocket goalie Tom Watyka.

But the booters appeared to
lay back on defense, protecting
the lead.

“I doIl"t think we purposely
played defense,” Bemis said. “Our

halfbacks, especially Ernie Mou-
en, were tired. All our fellows
were tired at that time.”

One player who never appear-
ed tired was senior Pete Snyder.
Saturday, he played his best
game in three years.

Since 1965, Snyder has played
on two teams tabbed as sure bets
to make the District playoffs.
This year, however, not many
people were optimistic.

“I feel more comfortable this
year than ever before,” said Sny-
der, who realizes Slippery Rock
always gets up for this game, the
big one on their schedule.

“Last year, there’s was a lot
of dissension, everyone knows
that,” said the team’s left wing.
“But this team is the greatest
to work with because no one hogs
the ball. We make plays yet we
just can’t get those little breaks
we need.”

Snyder, who is considering pro-
fessional soccer despite his small-
ness (5-7, 140), was always in the
offensive action. His sharp pass
to Peter Wolff" almost brought an
overtime win, but goalie Watyka
just brushed Wolff’s shot aside.

Tomorrow against the Wolver-
ines, the booters (0-3-2) realize
they still need their first win.
Last year, Grove City won at
home, 4-1, but “we hold a mar-

gin of victory over them here,”

pointed out Bemis.

Pete Anslemo and twins John
and Jim Pontier lead Grove City,
who have already beaten Slip-
pery Rock, 3-1,

ﬁve games. However, the offense has been in-
consistent, tallying only twice this season and
the booters are still searching for win num-

ber one. -

PETE SNYDER
Boater Left Wing

MADISON, Wisconsin-——There was no doubt who the
hero was Saturday. One only had to look at the hugging and
back slapping as the Panther bench greeted Bob Bazylak
after his brilliant performance.

Saturday might have made up for the disappointments
that Bazylak has consistently suffered in the past. As a
former high school All-American quarterback he found him-
self playing defensive halfback as a sophomore.

Having had never played defense before he will prob-
ably never forget the Duke game of that year. No one on
the Panther defense that day could stop the Blue Devil pass-
ing attack. But it was Bazylak who was yanked and it was
Bazylak who saw his confidence disappear.

Then last year, Baz did well against Notre Dame and
Syracuse but he was really playing behind Eddie James and
Mike Elliot for ‘the entire season.

His status seemed to be. improved this spring and dur-
ing fall camp when he was 
quarterbacking the first
team. “I really had acquired
confidence at camp,” Baz
said. But he suffered yet an-
other setback when coach
Dave Hart decided to go With
his sophomore signal-callers
shortly before the opener
against UCLA.

. ‘fl felt about two. inches
high after that,” said Baz.
“But I figured that since this
was my last year, I’d better
make the most of it. So I
kept plugging.”

Hart moved Bazylak to
wingback and frequently
praised his work in practice.
But it was only the injury
to Frank Gustine’s hand
that brought Baz back into
the iqularterback picture.

“Nobody doubted our de-
cision qularterback after the UCLA game,” Hart pointed
out. “But I told the coaches during the week that Baz would
get to play at Wisconsin. And at halftime, I decided to go
with him. He sure took advantage of the chance when it
came.” ‘ ,

Baz had only worked in Thursday's practice at quar-
terback. When he threw his first pass Saturday, it was his
first pass of the season. Baz completed that first one-, as
well as the next three. “I couldn’t believe it was happening
to me,” he kept repeating afterward.

When he fell down with the ball for the last time as
the clock ran out, Baz managed to keep ‘the football away
from the referee and he presented it to Hart in the locker-
room. Hart gave it right back to him. “He deserved it,”
Hart beamed.

The little guy d-oesn’t look like a quarterback, but some-
how he does the job. He did it in high school; in the Big 33
game against Texas; and at Camp Randall Stadium Satur-
day.

BOB BAZYLAK
“Somehow does the Job”

First Start at Tight Tackle

Pecman’s Addition Helps Stop Blitz

by ROY JACOBS

By now, everybody knows
what happened. In the sec-
ond half of Saturday’s foot-
ball game -against Wisconsin,
Bolb Bazylak, clad in shining
white armor, came off the bench
to throw ‘a lot -of passes, run a
couple times, «and guide the ‘var-
sity to its first win of the sea-
son.

-However, the reason for win-
ning isn’t that simple, nor should
it be. For three weeks before-
hand, people blamed the offen-
sive line for doing an ineffec-
tive job. It only stands to rea-
son that the line’s improvement
was a major factor in the vic-
tory.

One of the -reas-ons for the
vast improvement on the part of
the offensive line was the inser-
tion of Frank Pecmtan at tight
tackle. Pecman, the biggest man
on the squad at 242 pounds and
a two time letter winner, start-
ed for only the first time this
year Saturday, but he added
size and experience to the line-

 

up. Don’t think it didn’t make
It ‘difference.

“I think the size and experi
ence helped,” explained Frank.
“Everybody seemed to feel at
home out there. Everyone knew
the guys playing next to him
and what they would do on cer-

and you know, from the reports,
what he’s going to do. After
that it’s your job to block him."

Apparently, Pecman was dio-
ing his job because the quarter-
backrs had good protection all
day. But by his own admission,

 

 

  

tain plays. Just rooming with
Ray (Radakovich) help me know
him better on the ﬁeld.”

Still, familiarity doesn't beat
the blitz by itself. And the blitz
had been the varsity’s nemesis
before meeting Wisconsin. With
Pecvman at tackle and Tom M1-
trakos switched to center, both
Jeff Barr and Bazylak found
themselves with more time to
set and throw.

“Everybody worked hard all
week in practice," said Frank.
“And they (Wisconsin) didn’t do
anything different from our
scouting reports.

“The whole line could antici-
pate what they were golng to
do,” he continued. “Then it was
:1 matter of individual pride. You
know who you have to block

_ tion, then,’ can offset a strong

Wisconnsin’s -pass rush wasn’t
too good.

“They were strong,” he said,
“and I wouldn't say they weren’t
fast. I just didn’t think they hit
hard at all.” Which leaves the
question, what about the real
quick, hard hitting Ibl-itzers that
the varsity is going to see in
the next six weeks?

“Usually we have enough time
to see the blitz coming,” out.
lined Pecman. “If they’ve used
the blitz before, we'll go over it
in practice. The most important
thing is reading the blitz. You
Just read your keys (key play-
ers in the defense). If he moves

  Aptly Yclept Pietrantonio
Joins Distinguished List
Of ‘]umb1ed’ Panthers

by MHCE BROURMAN

One way or another, Bill Pietrantonio is going to both-
er people for the next four years.

A defensive back on the heralded Panther Cubs, Pie-
tranltonio ﬁts right in with what has almost become a tradition here.
Every year, it seams, the Panthers come up with a ballplayer whose
name borders on the unpronounceable.

A few years back it was Steve
Jastrezembski, then it was Al
Grigiliunas, now it’s Mike Rak-
lewicz. Next it will be Pietran-
tonio’s turn.

“Every place I go, people have

trouble pronouncing it,” Bill ad-

mits. “They come up with a lot
of different ones.” This is not
hard to imagine with a monicker
that looks like the result of a
spilled bowl of alphabet soup.

‘ But, despite the thoughts of
skeptical sports broadcasters,
Dave Hart did not recruit Pie-
trantonio to baffle them. He re-
cruited him to cause havoc among
opposing offenses.

Bill is a defensive back for the

. Cubs, alternating between corner-

back and safety in the shifting
defensenln practice, he also look-
ed good at split end, but he main-
tains that he is happy on de-
fense. “There’s more action than
on offense. Sometimes on of-
fense you just run a pattern to
draw a back away from the play.
On defense you’re always involv-
ed.” ‘

One such involvement occured
against West Virginia. Lloyd Wes-
ton tipped a pass up and, Bill
relates,
West Virginia receivers out so I
came over to help out. After I
intercepted, all I saw was a clear

“there were ho other

L field down the sidelines. I just

took off. There was just that
one man. there.” That one man
knocked Bill out of bounds at the
WVU 10 yard line, but it did set
up a Cub score. '

C “I like running with the ball,”
he added. Usually, the only
chance he gets to run is on punts.
“That’s fun,” he noted. “I don’t
like calling for a fair catch un-
less its absolutely necessary. If
there’s only one guy coming down
on you and you have a chance,

then run.” Following his own ad-
vice, Bill averaged almost 20
yards a punt return for Borden-
town prep last year. And that
was with the old style punt rule.

With Penn State coming up this
week, the frosh are busy pre-
paring themselves for the Lions.
State runs a completely different
style attack than WVU, but, ac-
cording to Pietrantonio, the de-
fense is making no adjustments.
“We did ’a11 right, so we’ll stick
basically to the same things.”

“We think We’re going to win.
We’re not overconfident. Every-

one knows it’ll be a tough game.
But we'll win.”

.BILL PILCONIS (87) runs his

pattern covered closely by Bill
Pietrantonio.

Bill Pietrantonio has some com-
petition for his “most unpro-
nounceable name” award. There

Cubs Visit State Friday;
Lewis Confident o f Win

by JERRY GRUEBEL

The freshman football
team visits Penn State Fri-
day afternoon in game two
of a four-game schedule. Coach
Darrell Lewis doesn't have any
information on the Little Lions,
but ‘he is conﬁdent that game
two will be win ‘two.

“They have 11 men, and so do .

we,” explains Lewis. “That’s all
we have to know. We’ll -beat
)em.!!

The Cubs romvped over the
Little Mountaineers of West
Virginia, 362, in their opening
game, but Lewis feels that his
team has «improved since then.

“They’re better now than they
were three weeks ago,” boasts
Lewis, “After all, they should
be. They’ve been practicing.”

One improvement, among
others, has ‘been quairterbacl:
Don Plusquellic. Plusquellic, an
All-State Ohio high school play-
er could help the varsity next

2 year.

“-Plusquellic is keeping his
passes up now,” noted Lewis.
“He'll be used in varsity games
next year.”

Game two, however, won’t be
as easy as it seems. Penn State
recruited a -crop of good foot-
ball players. The Little Lions
this year have two highly tout-
ed quarterbacks from Pennsyl-
vania. Mike -Smith, an All-Stator
from Anville, and Terry Stump,
a Big .33’er from Mifflintown
could make the Penn State air
attack rough.

Charlie Adams, a hometown
All-City htallﬁb-ack from Glad-
tone High School, and Eran Gan-
ter, an All-WTPIAL fullback from
Bethel Park could keep the de-
fense hon-est on the ground.

Friday is the ﬁnst game for
the Little Lions. Just how ‘tough
they are won’t be known until
then. '

Capture Two
At Grove City

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Winning, a word which is
beginning to appear more
frequently on these pages,
has been the keynote for coach
Jim Banner’s varsity and fresh
men cross country squads so
far this season.

Saturday, the di-stancemen
traveled to Grove City and
brought back two victories with
them. The varsity (5-1) ran their
streak to four wins in a row by
defeating the -Grovers, 22-33.
The freshmen remained “per-
fect” as they shut out the Wol-
verine frosh, 15-50, for their
ﬁfth victory against no defeats.

Paul Greig again led the har-
riers to victory. For his ﬁfth
win, he covered the 4.1 mile
course in a time of 21 mzinrutes
36 seconds. “It was a fairly
good time for G-reiig, but not his
best effort. The competition was
not really strong enough to
cause him to push himself,” said
Banner.

Paul Zink, who according to

Banner is beginning to come
along, ﬁnished second. The har-
ri.ers’ Ken Lawton placed fourth
and Roger Holly and Jay Jen-
sen ﬁnished seventh and eighth,
respectively.

According to Banner, “Grove
City was :3. pretty fair team
which had been undefeated un-
til we met them.” The Wolver-
ines placed’ three men, in the
top eight. Grover Art Ruff took
third and Jim Weiner and Max
Gill placed ﬁfth and sixth.

The frosh ‘continued their per-
foot streak as they shutout -their
ﬁfth victims.‘ Running over the
same course as the varsity,
number one man Jerrry Richey
gained his ﬁfth victory .in :a rec-
ord setting performance. He
covered the 4.1 miles in a time
of 21:06, shattering the old
Grove City record.

Following Richey were Greg
Rodgers, Mike Nolan, John Cro-
Ziera Bill Matajasic, and Jeff
Wilson.

In Fraternity Softball ‘A

Pi Lam Takes ‘A’ Title
Kappa Sig Wins in ‘B’

by ED CONLEY
With the football schedule nearing, fraternity softball
has finally come up with its league champions. The “A”
chlamp is Pi Lambda Phi, and the “B” king is Kappa Sigma.

These two teams will play for the over-all fraternity softball
title sometime this week. The game has yet to be scheduled.

Pi Lam won the “A” title with
a 1-0 victory over Phi Epsilon Pi.
In‘ the tight pitcher’s duel,
Chuck Greene blasted a fourth-
inning home run for the only Pi
Lam run. It was all that was

The losing pitcher, Bob Pacha,
gave up only six hits in the game.
But poor fielding in the seventh
inning, and lack of hitting when
needed brought on the defeat.

PiKa had two players hit safe-

, a walk, and Ron Lucas’ double

   

needed, as Steve Rosenbaum
scattered seven hits in blanking
Phi Ep.

The losing pitcher, Bob Black,
also limited Pi Lam to seven
hits. But, Phi Ep co-uldn’t cash
in on the few opportunities it
had, and went down to defeat.
The only two players with two
hits in the game fo-r Phi Ep
were Jeff Levkoff and Jim Madi-

ly twice in the losing cause.
They were Bob Salembier and
John Petro, each banging out
two singles.

The winning pitcher was Larry
Lesniak, who contributed in the
scoring of the first run in the
third inning. Lesniak gave up
seven hits. He got himself out of
the few tough spots that PiKa
put him in, and preserved the
shut-out.

Yogi  Protest ‘
Expected As
Scores Fall

They’ll be some changes
in the Yogi contest next
week. After two consecutive
terrible showings, the sages are
up in arms over -the bumbling
idiot who selects the games.

“He’s a bumbling idiot,”
sc-reamed Mike “Hawk” Brour-
man, who registered the worst
mark of the year, 5-9, to fall into
sixth place. There are those
w1ho_would question the intelli-
gence of -the “Hawk” after such
a showing, but he is not among
them.

“What we need,” said Jay
“F.ltat'b.u.sh Rosenstein” are easi-
er games, like the Green Bay
Packers vs. Oshkosh State. Then
we'd have some good scores."
Off his 7-7 mark, and his 29-30
record on the year, there are
those who believe that the “Flat-
bush” would ‘stake his reputa
tion (at least what there is left
of it) on Oshkosh.

“We should buy ‘Flatbush’ a
weegie board,” yelped George
“Moustachio” Lies in his cus-
