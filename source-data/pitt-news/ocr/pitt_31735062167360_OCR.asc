Engineers
To Become
Chairmen

Three professors from the Elec-
trical Engineering Department at
the University‘s School of Engi-
neering will become department
chairmen at other schools this fall.
All three engineers received doc-
torates from the University School
of Engineering.

Dr. Donald H. Gillott received
his Doctor of Science in 1963. He
has served as a consultant to the
National Academy of Sciences
and has done research in magnet-
ics supported by the National
Science Foundation. He served as
coordinator of the Electrical En-
gineering Graduate Program. Gil-
lott will move to Sacramento State
College. Sacramento. Calif.

Dr. Ronald G. Schultz will join
the faculty at Cleveland State Col-
lege. Cleveland. Ohio. He receiv-
ed his B.S. from Rose Polytechnic.
his M.Sc. from Northwestern Uni-
versity. and his PhD. from the
University of Pittsburgh in 1959.
He has been a consultant to the
United States Steel Corporation,
and has published a manual on
“Analoque Computer Components
and Techniques.”

Dr. Donald E. Rathbone will
move to the University of Idaho,
Moskow, Id a h o . Rathbone r e -
ceived his Ph.D. in 1962 from the
University. He is presently com-
pleting work on a $250,000 Unit-
ed States Army Research Grant
in the field of automatic control
theory. He is also a consultant to
the National Academy of Sci-
ences.

Each of the three schools to
which these men are going is de-
veloping a strong Electrical Engi-
neering Department. The Univer-
sity is pleased to be able to pro-
vide these outstanding young men
to assume leadership positions in
new departments.

“Great. really great." exclaim-
ed track coach Jim Banner. This
was the only way possible to ex-
press one's emotions concerning
this weekend’slC4A track meet at
Philadelphia. Tracksters J e rry
Richey. Carlos Reisen.. Bryant
Salter. Roger Holly. and Wayne
Bodenheimer gave their best per-
formances ever.

Probably the mile race was the
single most sensational event of
the two day meet. Five runners
smashed the four-minute mark.
And even though Jerry Richey
posted a 3258.6 time. he only fin-
ished third. However. Richey be-
came the first student at the Uni-
versity or even the first Pitts-
burgher to crash the four minute
mile barrier.

“It was a great feeling. a real
thrill, and I thought he could do
it.” said Banner. Originally
Richey was to_ have run in the
three mile. competing against
Georgetown champion S t e v e
Stageberg. Banner explained that
his main reason for switching
Richey was to give him a chance
to break the four minute mile. es-
pecially since he felt that Jerry
could do well in either event.

Later, Richey commented, “I
thought that I could break the

four minute mile this year if I
only had enough chances to run
in the mile. Saturday the weather
was just perfect, and I knew that
I probably had gone under four
minutes when I went over the fin-
ish line.”’ The two tracksters who
finished ahead of Richey were
Villanova’s D a v e Patrick a n d
Manhattan’s Brian Kivlin. Pat-
trick’s 3:56.8 was the fastest one
mile outdoor time recorded in the
East.

Sophomore Bryant Salter and
seniors Roger Holly and Wayne
Bodenheimer also placed among
the top five in their respective
events. “Salter did a real good job

‘in the triple-jump. finishing sec-

ond. commented Banner. By
jumping 49 feet. six inches. Sal-
ter bettered his own school rec-
ord. Nevertheless. Ed Marks of
Maryland won the event with a
50 foot. one inch distance. Bry-
ant however. didn’t perform as
well in the high jump. Banner ex-
plained that the triple-jump takes
too much of his energy for him to
leap well afterwards in the high
jump.

Banner also remarked that Rog-
er Holly’s 1:49.7 was the best
halfmile time recorded in the Uni-
versity since the time of Olympic
track star Arnie Sowell. Holly’s
great time earned him a fifth

place medal. Wayne Bodenheim-
er also gained a spot in the Uni-
versity record books when he
threw the javelin 225 feet. nine
inches to take fourth place in the
meet. Bodenheimer’s toss broke
a 52 year old record set by
Charles Gongloff. However. Vil-
lanova’s Jim Shillow won first
place with a throw of 234 feet.
six inches.

Another trackster who made
coach Banner happy was Carlos
Reisen. He took a seventh place
in theﬁfinals of the 440 hurdles.
“His :52 was his best time ever,
and he’s only a sophomore. He
looks real good,” Banner gleem-
ed.

Coach Banner apparently en-
joyed this track meet better than
any other of the entire season.
“This was one of the best track
meets ever held in the East,” ex-
claimed Banner. With three great
sophomore s t a r s . Banner c a n
rightfully deserve to be happy.
Even though Banner still believes
t h at Villanova, Harvard. a n d
Maryland are the class of the
East, he can expect glory in the
days ahead. In these future days.
the performances of Holly and
Bodenheimer will always be re-
membered while Richey, Salter.
and Reisen continue to crack rec-
ords.

Not A “Ghetto Program”

City Unveils Summer
Recreation Program

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Mayor Joseph M. Barr and his
committee revealed an ambitious
summer recreation program for
the city last Tuesday afternoon at
a luncheon held at Canter's Res-

aurant.

Mayor Barr stressed that this
was not a “ghetto program.” The
recreational facilities will be
made available for the privileged
as well as the underprivileged.
“It (the program) is designed to
serve all sections of Pittsburgh."
said the mayor.

“Traditional recreational pro-
grams no longer attract the inter-
est and attention needed." cited
Burrell Cohen. executive assistant
to the mayor. in announcing the
new plans.

The program, supported by con-
tributions as well as tax funds,
will include all age groups and
sexes.

For younger children. two over-
night camping facilities will be
available. One will be in Schen-
ley Park. the other at Lake Pyma—

tuming State Park. They will han-
dle 50 to 100 children at a time
in one week sessions that will be
conducted all summer long. Their
program is mainly for kids whose
parents cannot afford to s e n (1
them to overnight camp.

Trips on the Good Ship Lolli-
pop. Maury Wills baseball clinics
and Connie Hawkins basketball
clinics will be set up all over the
city to instruct interested youths.

A Summer Youth Olympiad will
be conducted. It will include ath-
letic competition between neigh-
borhoods. The best three individ-
uals will represent Pittsburgh in
two national contests.

There will also be summer has-
ketball leagues. sponsored by the
Dapper Dan organization. Each
recreational center in the city
will compete in playoffs to be
held at the Civic Arena.

The city has purchased three
mobile swimming pools. This
summer they will be put in the
Hm-rnn Hill. Homewood. and

GSPIA Students
Ask System Change

by PEGGY ALLEN

A group of graduate students,
claiming that the “current curri-
culum of the Graduatd School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA) is inadequate for the
needs of those seeking an educa-
tion in the urban affairs.” have
organized the Urban Affairs Stu-
dent Association in hopes of work-
ing with the administration to im-
prove the program of studies.

The students complain that the
present atmosphere of the school
is “one of a faculty elite dispens-
ing knowledge to subservient stu-
dents, rather than one in which
all involved are endeavoring to-
gether to use and develop the
body of knowledge in the area of
urban affairs.”

A spokesman for the association
claimed that students were being
treated “as sheep” instead of re-
sponsible adults. “We w a nt to
minimize the structure and maxi-
mize the personal relationship be-
tween students and professors.”
he said. “Letter grades confound
this interaction.

The GSPIA students also claim

SG Allocations Meeting Set

SG will hold its annual alloca-
tions meeting Saturday. In an un-
precedented attempt to give all
student organizations a fair oppor-
tunity to explain and support their
annual programs. the SG Alloca-
tions Commiteee has held over 40
interviews since May 1.

With the conclusion of inter-
views this week the committee
will begin the awesome and high-
ly responsible job» of evaluating

each organization’s request, The
requests received total $220.000.
With only $117,000 to allocate. the
committee and Senate are faced
with scrutinizing over 40 organ-
izational programs in the hope of
presenting to the student body
next year the finest and most
equitable program of activities.
The overall success of next
year’s student activities will de-
pend on the decisions made at this

meeting. SG President Ken
Schueler. therefore. is hoping for
100 per cent attendance. Last year
only six senators showed up for
one allocations meeting. Another
was attended by only 12 senators.
To encourage the maximum num-
ber of the 25 senators to attend.
Schueler has scheduled the meet-
ing for the most convenient day
for them and has made housing
arrangements for those senators

that “there is little or no research
activity evident in the depart-
ment,” and that “it is the respon-
sibility of the University to be-
come committed to Urban Af-
fairs.”

The Association hopes to affect
these changes by working with
the administration. Chancellor
Wesley Posvar has appointed a
three-man committee of faculty
members to work with the stu-
dents. The Association feels that
the students should help to ap-
point this committee. One stu-
dent, a Ph.D. cahpidate, said that
his involvement of students in the
University “should be consider-
ed an experiment in professional
education” and that “it is logical
to have students run their own af-
fairs.”

The students feel that “they
should be able to determine their
own programs of study in consul-
tation with the Urban Affairs fac-
ulty” and that “both the faculty
and the students involved with a
given course would be responsi-
ble for structuring the course.”

In general, the faculty is wil-
ling to work with thd students.
One Dr. Solow, professor of Ur-
ban and Regional Planning, said
he “welcomes participation of
students in our thinking out a cur-
riculum, particularly in the form
of dialogue.”

The students say they are de-
termined to “accept their respon-
sibilities in the joint effort to im-
prove the Urban Affairs curricu-
lum and work toward more fully
realizing the potential of the

-Opaque Future

by PAUL STOLLER,
Pitt News Editor

The beer still flows at the college fraternity party and the
old fashion cheers of spirit for the “great institution” ring har-
moniously in the traditional atmosphere of the football game.
e Popular entertainers still perform before overflow student audi-
ences.

Men clad in their three piece suits, Gant shirts and wing
tip shoes and women in their Villager blouses still walk down
the campus sidewalks seemingly content. And all the adults
‘smile on Parent’s Weekend when they see their loved ones in
the perspective of the protective aura of the University campus.

But all of this is past. Students today may
seem to be content, but they are essentially
disturbed people striving to find themselves.
They are attempting to relate themselves to
the obtuse dizziness of the ugly world. Many
of them still face an arduous journey.

Theecollege students today are tired of the
 ‘ old fashion ideas; they are tired of moms apple

'15.} Stolkf pie; they are tired of the organized religions

T whose rules are limiting and frustrating; they
want to strike out on their own. But society stifles the college
student.

 

Booze, beer, striped ties, and Villager blouses are no longer
in vogue. They are supplemented today by pot, hip talk. the un-

- derground press; and the new morality.

The vogue today is rebe1lion——rebellion against parents; re-
bellion against the “establishment.” This vogue exists because
students are frustrated beings who sense a certain indifferent
hopelessness about their opague futures.

That hopelessness stems not only from the status orienta-
tion of our rat race society but from the tremendous challenges
of college existence. The premium of success is very apparent
in the day to day lives of the college student. Every freshman as-
pires to “college success.” Every student needs to be a “frat
man,” an individualist, a “student leader,” ant accepted entity,
or a cool cat. But many of the aspirants just don’t make it; they
fail in their attempt to be accepted by their peers. Consequently.
those who fail in one manner or another be it academics or so-
_cial acceptance, seek another mode of existence or acceptance.
This will grant then the vital security that all persons need.

This somewhat simplistic pattern has changed as of late.
Even the student leaders, the cool cats, and the accepted en-
tities sense an insoluble hopelessness today. Even their thoughts
-—the thoughts of those who have met the college challenge with
some “success”—are infiltrated by indifference and sometimes
animosity toward the old ways. They, too, are seeking a new
mode to satisfy their security needs.

There is a new restlessness on the college campus. And this
restlessness caused by the students search for his identity has
coalesced in the student power movement. Student power is
nothing more than the expression of the student’s need for iden-
tity. Students want to govern themselves; they want a chance to
prove to themselves that they are capable beings who can be
successful in the most difficult endeavor of self-government.

But society and the “establishment” summarily rejects this
movement. They associate student power with violent outbursts.
What they fail to realize is that these violent outbursts are caus-

ed from their own big brotherism which is euphemistically call-
ed paternalism. Parents, university administrators, andthe finan-

I cial mentors of society are all paternalistic. And this the stu-

dent resents for he has been‘ educated to be skeptical and inde-
pendent; he wants to be free from the paternalitic tongs of this
society.

One person has suggested that students should go to their
classes and that’t all. But the student receives more of his edu-

cation outside of the classroom.

The time has come for the adult generation to open its mind
to student needs and desires for the society that keeps a closed

Wise Confusion...That’s The Trouble

Hello Mom. «

A good man passed this way
once. He came to rest and have
some fun. and rest some more.
But no one of hard stones and
busy people. No one said there
are pretty girls and long hair and
pasley. And they didn‘t ask why
Mr. Jones has lots of money. The
good man was happy and content
but not wise.

“What good is being wise." I
say, “if you are happy and con-
tent3’

I AM LOST and not yet happy
or content. I am troubled because
of many things. I know with my

brain and I hear with my ears
and I see with my eyes. but it‘s
too damned much to try to under-
stand.

I wondered about sacrifice but
I said. “It will never do."

Men are lonely and they don’t
need meat they need people. I
am lonely but not enough to cry.
I just sit and think for awhile of
sun and the rain and I could cry.
not for long. for a policeman kick-
ed me off my “sleeping bench."

AS I WALK by. a white wall
stares at me: I stand there and
pity it. for it would soon become
dirty like the other walls.

Now it is night and the stars
are there but there are too many
lights on to notice. The people
are still busy and the cars run
over the street and son there is’
silence. Silence enough for a man
to think.

So I think of people for they
are life. and life is what you
make it. I think of how I have
made it. but as I am human I try
to push the blame on people.

I SAID—“It couldn’t be all my
fault." I remember a lonely smile.

“No. it wasn't the first."

I am poor because being poor
is not having what you want.
whether it’s a smile or a bottle of
beer.

I don’t know what to do with
myself and haven’t dreamed in
I4 months. but. I hope a hell of
a lot. Who knows how long it will
take before I lose my mind even
I am not concerned.

I shall take a brick and carry
it around until I find someone to
throw it at and don’t stop me
please unless you know that ev-
eryone hates bricks.

‘And She Was Tired And Bitter,
Filled With Life’s Imposed Evil’

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

The sun looked down like an
angry yellow eye. and it was hot.
It was so hot that your skin felt
like popping. There was nothing
moving over the land that was
forever dry. The wind was silent.
waiting for that time to come
forth to cool things off. The hills
were round and squatty. once
proud mountains now shrunken
and humiliated. And amid this
barren quallor sat the shack with
the old lady and the kid.

She was old from life. and her
dry skin cracked as she pushed
the broom and struggled with the
plow. She , had nothing to show
for her 48 years except the mem-
ory of a long-gone husband who
left her alone with the kids. And
she was tired and bitter and fill-
ed with life’s imposed evil.

Her kid was a good kid. never
complaining about the nothings
they had always smiling at the
old lady. always trying to make
her smile back. He went to school
during the day because the old
lady made him go. so that. in her
words. “You kin be sumpin’ be-
sides a nothin’ nobody.” And the
kid tried hard because of his
mother. and she was quietly
proud of him.

THAT DAY the kid came run-

ning into the small shack look-

How Our

Student Raps
Disinterest

In March

Editor. The Pitt News:

I just finished reading your ar-
ticle in Wednesdays paper con-
cerning student reaction to the
Poor People’s Campaign. I am ap-
palled at the lack of interest. the
lack of understanding shown by

“intelligent. educated” people.
This lack of concern is the root
of the whole problem.

It is not that “Whitey” is in-
capable of comprehending. but.
because of fear. ignorance. or
plain laziness. he does not seek:
he does not even care to know.
His own monster has him in an
agonizing grip from which apa-
thy is the only relief.

Last week. CBS presented. for
the second time. a very enlighten-
ing ard painful report on hunger

and, Poverty 1590*? to 5.9“??? of

mg for the old lady.

“Hey Ma. where are ya. Ma,
come here quick.”

Thd old lady was behind the
shack. and came running when
she heard the urgency of the
kid’s voice.

“WHAT IS it boy? What are
you screamin’ like that for?
What’s happened?”

“Ma.” said the kid gulping for
air.” Terrence got hisself a
horse. An’ it’s a big bay one. with
white stockings on all four feet.
An’ it’s fast as a car. an’ it came
with a real leather saddle.”

Thd old lady looked at the kid.
She wiped the sweat from her
forehead. and pushed the wet
gray hair out of her eyes.

“AN’ THIS is what you came
runnin’ home all afire about? You
scared me out a my head with
that screaming boy.”

“I’m sorry Ma. but I just had-
da tell ya.’ Ma. kin we git a horse
like Terrence’s?”

“Boy. we ain’t got enough for
a pig. let alone a horse.”

“BUT IF we used him for the
farm. we could git rid a that old
cow that don’t give milk and can’t
pull the plow. An’ it would be
easier for you.’ an’ in a while it
would pay for itself.”

“Boy. you got your nerve. I

ain’t had nothin’ so you could

have some things to make life
better for ya’. An’ now ya’ want
to go into hock for a horse that
we can’t afford. Boy. let me be.”

“But Ma, Terrence made fun
a me cause we ain’t got a horse.
An’ he said he’s better than me
cause he’s got one.”

THEN WHY don’t ya sneak
over an’ shoot the horse. Then he
won’t have nothin neither.”

“You mean that Ma? I should
really do that?”

“Boy.” she said very slowly,
“I’m too. tired to not mean what
I say any more.” .

AND FOR the first time in his
life. the kid saw how tired she
really was.

“All right Ma.” the kid said
softly. “I know ya mean it.”

The next morning the kid walk-
ed over to the lady’s bed and
shook her.

“MA,” HE said as the lady
opened her eyes. “I done like ya
said. It’s dead, and no one saw.”

“Okay son,” said the tired old
lady,” you did good in not gettin’
caught.”

“But Ma.” came the pleading
young voice.” I still want a horse.

Readers See It . . .

my acquaintances the next day to
see what their reaction was.

Many thought that it was dis-
gusting and only watched a few
minutes. after which it became
unbearable and they “turned off
the TV set.” Others just had to
watch the movie or whatever
other programs were on the air.
To them the program would just
be another plug for the “ni-gers
and poor trash” one hears so
much about these days.

It’s disgusting.

The picture. a tiny black baby.
the skin hanging from his limbs.
his stomach swollen and distend-
ed from malnutrition. It is dis-
gusting. isn‘t it? It is painfully
true. ‘

The picture. a black or white
sharecropper whose labors reap
$16.000 for the landowner. Of this
$16.000 his share is $800 if he’s
lucky. Another sharecropper gets
$90 out of 2.300. Well. hell. he
can make it on $800.

How many whites complain of
just gettin- by on $800 a month?

And $90 a week is a r al squeeze, V

Yet to expect “Sam” to get by on
that much is not asking much.

The poor man-—black and white
alike——in asking for financial stab-
ility is approaching the shrine of
God. the wallet. the pocketbook.
Because he seeks God. they would
feed him to the lions. This long-
enshrouded fact became more and
more evident to me as I watched
the special. Of course. it was far
too disgusting for “whitey."
Like the program. the caravan of
poor who stayed on this campus
was terribly disgusting. Th ey
didn’t even wear ties. they were
noisy. and. rumor has it. some of
then even drank.

Isn’t that disgusting? You
know what they might be doing
next. You wouldn't want that to
happen to your sister. After all.
we can’t let these people carry
this thing too far. and behaving
like human beings might be car-
rying things a bit too far.

The preceding is the type" of

tolerance these people have been
putting up with for ages.

Golfers End
In Defeat to

by ED CONLEY

Rex Peery and his golf team
ea ed a disappointing season in
a disappointing manner Friday
by losing their ninth match of the
season. 6-1. to Penn State. The
team won six this spring.

The loss was the first one at
the home course. the Shannopin
Country Club. and, like many of
the other defeats. the opposition
was far too rough for the golfers
to handle.

The only Panther point came
when John Meteney edged State’s
Tom Apple by one stroke. Meten-
ey fired a 74 to Apple’s 75.

The only other close match was
the one in which Panther Henry
Higgenbottom came in second
best to Lion Mack Corbin, 78-80.

Bill Bryan and Meteney were
the only Panther golfers to break
80. and after the match Bryan
was voted the season’s outstand-
ing golfer by his teammates.

Peery reasoned the loss to State
saying. “They have a good team
and the hole just wasn’t big
enough for us. We couldn’t get it
(the ball) in.”

Pete Keller and Rick Golden

fired 85's in the loss and Mike
McGuire shot an 80. John Della-
versen came in with an 83.

The coach was pleased with
one thing in the final loss. That
was the condition of the Shanno-

Then the two great Democratic
senators came on the air. Senator
McCarthy looked very fatherly
in his plain suit. Bobby Kennedy
looked young and vibrant in a pin
striped suit.

“Did he dye his hair? Ithlooks
awfully blonde,” Billy asked me.

“I don’t know but it looks like
he cut it again.” I answered.

“Yes. but look!" Billy blurted
out. “He has some hair hanging
over his ears.”

Yes, it was true! Bobby Kenne-
dy had hair hanging over his ears.
This proved to be about the most
revealing fact that I learned dur-
ing the entire program.

the season just completed. Peery
would like to look forward and
think about improvement next
spring.

He comments. “You always ex-

we probably should have a better
team next year.”

PETE KELLER was one of the
five golfers who failed to break
the magic mark of 80 in the duf-

Shannopin Country Club on Fri-

match of the season; they won six
matches in a disappointing year.

Arts Festival Exhibits
Show Great Creativity

by arse WEINBERG

Thd Three Rivers Arts Festi-
val is running from now through
June 9. Even if you hate art. make
every attempt to see the Festival.
It is a tangible proof that Pitts-
burgh is not a cultural wasteland.

Although many of the exhibits
are composed of strange materi-
als. the majority show great crea-
tivity. The work of Nine Barsot-
ti and Edward Kosewicz involve
metal and leather. But none of
their end products look like met-
al or steel. Mr. Barsotti's sculp-
ture. “Sunflowers." is made of

y-McCarthyBoreViewers

The two senators disappointed-
ly proved that what has been sus-
pected all along. that they really
have not major differences of
opinion. They gave basically the
same answers for each question
but reworded them "using differ-
ent euphemisms. For an hour they
managed to say nothing new or
significant.

On the question of the Paris
peace talks. they both favored an
immediate bombing halt. and an
eventual pullout of Vietnam. Ken-
nedy said nothing unique when
he said. “I think the money be-
ing spent on the Vietnam war
could be better used on the war
on poverty.” Thanks Bobby! In
the main. the two politicians tried
to play up their respective images
rather than the issues. When talk-
ing about the issues they used a
few catch phrases to make it ap-
pear as if they were really saying
somthing significant.

At the conclusion of this bor-
ing dicussion Billy moaned,
“Let’s go to Shadyside, it has to
be more exciting than this.”

It wasn’t.

metal but has all the delicacy of
a living flower. It even sways
gently in the wind.

Two of Mr. Kosewicz‘s sculp-
tures are outstanding, “Brazen
Hussey" and “Fattish Fetish.”
The former uses exaggerated
parts of the anatomy and a high-
ly polished finish to create the
impression of a scheming wom-
an. The latter is a tall mass of
leather and nails. These materials
are conducive to the feeling of
strength. solidity. The quality
that makes all these works artful
is that they communicate to us
some kind of emotional response.

When looking at the paintings
which are on display, some can
be disgarded as examples of id-
iocy. However, many excellent
paintings are on show. JoeAnn
Dombrosky, M. Melodini, and J.
Hall have saved the Festival with
their work. Miss Dombrosky’s
painting, “Cosmic Revelation,”
has an eerie, mysterious quality.
The artist has created the feeling
of a melted wax surface to create
the supernatural.

Mr. Melodini has taken a new.
refreshing approach to religious
art with “Pieta.” The fact that
the woman with her back to you
is Mary and the Half-hidden body
in Christ is not immediately no-
ticeable. You get the feeling of
actual grief before you can place
the characters. The painting re-
quires careful studying, but you
walk away from it feeling that
your soul has been cleansed.

Mr. J. Hall has used large geo-
metric shapes to communicate the
power of “Executives.” It’s over-
powering feeling is quite impres-
sive.
