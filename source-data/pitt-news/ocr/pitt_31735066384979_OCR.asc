Writing conference generates ideas

By Tracy Yossa and
Michelle Staffen

For The Pitt News

Flying lizards, space creatures
and science fiction buffs invaded
the William Pitt Union Saturday
for the First Annual Pittsburgh
Science Fiction Conference.

Sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Area Real Time Science Fiction
Enthusiasts Club and the Pitt Stu-
dent Science Fiction and Fantasy
Association, the conference fea-
tured speakers on a variety of
science fiction related topics as
well as a dealers’ room where
new and used books and science
fiction collectors’ items were
sold.

The highlight of the conference
was an all-day writers workshop
which gave aspiring science-
fiction authors the opportunity to
discuss their efforts with each
other.

Dennis McKiernan (author of
the Iron Tower trilogy and the Sil-
ver Call books) and short story

_ authors Lawrence C. Connolly

and John Alfred Taylor were
present to offer comments and
criticism.

Connolly encouraged work-
shop participants to read their
own works out loud so the group
could critique them.

ll

You either write for
love or money. I love to
write.

— Dennis McKiernan

ll

”We’re here to see what
works,” he said. ”No one can
read your work better than you.”

McKiernan, an electrical en-
gineer who writes novels in his
spare time, impressed upon the
novice writers the importance of
not giving up their everyday jobs

in order to devote their time ex-
clusively to writing.

_ ”You either write for love or
money,” he said. “I love to
write.”

He also emphasized the impor-
tance of revising parts of complet-
ed stories.

”When you finish your story,
you are a much better writer than
when you began,” he said. ”So,
rewrite!”

The conference also included
lectures by Pitt professors entitled
”Futures In Space” by Dr. Bruce
Hapke and ”The Use of Physics
in Science Fiction” by Dr. Allen
Janis.

Dr. Philip Smith, chairman of
Pitt's English department, spoke
about ”New Holocausts in
Science Fiction” and recent Drue
Heinz Literature Prize winner
Reginald McKnight lectured on
”Portraying the Opposite Sex in
Science Fiction.”

The Giant Eagle on Forbes
Avenue in Oakland reopened on
September 12 after closing be-
cause of financial losses due to
shoplifting.

”We are pleased with the store.
It is very nice and clean,’’ said Pat
Scanlon, president of the South‘
Oakland Citizens Association, a
group that was instrumental in
the reopening of the store.

Scanlon said that because of
the large population of students
and the elderly in the area, there
is a great need for the store. She
said that the store not only serves

' South Oakland, but also the Hill

District, where there are no
grocery stores.

It usually takes 90 days for a
buyer to purchase a franchise, but
Giant Eagle sped up the process
so that the store was only closed
for a month. Giant Eagle also
provided shuttle bus transporta-
tion so that customers could shop
at other Giant Eagles while the
Oakland store was closed.

The franchise was bought by
Ron Bold, Jr. and his father Ron
Bold, Sr., who have been looking
for a Giant Eagle franchise to buy
during the past year. Bold Jr. said
that they cleaned up the store,
reset the shelves and added a
greater variety.

Bold also said that the store has
hired a security outfit that works
seven days a week. Since the
store's opening day, a couple of
shoplifters have already been ap-

prehended.

Chesschamps to face
hi-tech innovations

By Jim Tezak

For The Pitt News

Murray Head may soon‘ be
forced to change some of the lyr-
ics to ”One Night in Bangkok,"
his 1984 hit song describing the
world chess scene.

The reason is that a chess com-
puter designed by Dr. Hans Ber-
liner, a professor at Carnegie
Mellon University, has been post-
ing some very impressive results

in chess tournaments around the

country.

Most recently, Berliner’s
machine, Hitech, won the Penn-
sylvania State Chess Champion-
ship in July. In the process,
Hitech also gained enough rating
points to become the first com-
puter with the title of senior
master, the highest title a chess
player can achieve on the nation-
al level.

Hitech defeated International
Master Ed Formanek in the last
round of the tournament to win
the state title. It is believed to be
only the second time that a com-
puter has beaten an internation-
al master. '

Berliner became interested in
building chess computers in the
late 1950s. At the time, he was
one of the top 12 chess players
in the United States and had
decided to pursue a career in
computer programming and sys-
tems analysis. ’’I was interested in
computers, and I was interested
in chess, so it was sort of natural
to be interested in the combina-
tion,” said Berliner.

Berliner wrote his first chess
program in I968, about the same
time he won the -World Cor-
respondence Chess Champion-
ship. He then decided to enroll
in the computer science curricu-
Ium at CMU, with the ideal of
writing a chess program that
could play master level chess.

”Somehow, I thought that if I
got really serious about it, it ought
to be fairly easy to write a pro-
gram that could play master lev-
el chess. That wasn't the case at
all. It was very, very hard,” said
Berliner. ”My understanding of
chess didn't seem to help very
much.”

Progress on Berliner’s program
was slow, mainly‘ because the
computer could not analyze
moves very far ahead. However,
two major developments in the
early 1980s enabled Berliner to
significantly improve the quality
of his chess programs.

First, around 1980, people be- J

gan building special—purpose
machines, such as computers
built especially to play chess.
These machines could analyze
moves much faster than normal
computers. ”It turned out that the
thing that was most important in
playing good chess was having a
fast machine,” said Berliner.
Then, in 1981, Carl Ebeling, a
student at CMU interested in
computer architecture, designed
a special—purpose computer chip.
Ebe|ing’s chip, called a VLSI chip,
could be used as a chess-move
generator in Berliner’s p/rogram.

Coup in Burma, fourth new government this year 

RANGOON, Burma (AP) —
Armed forces commander Saw
Maung ousted the civilian presi-
dent on Sunday, and thousands
of people surged into the streets
to demand democracy and pro-
test the fourth change in the
government in two months.

Gen. Saw Maung said, in a
statement broadcast by state Ra-
dio Rangoon, he overthrew Presi-
dent Maung Maung to halt
economic and social chaos and
to hold democratic elections af-

ter 26 years of authoritarian rule. _

The fate of Maung Maung was
not known, and there were no
reports of casualties or arrests.

Saw Maung, 59, immediately
abolished key government insti-
tutions and slapped an 8 p.m. to
4 a.m. curfew on the capital, the
country's largest city with 2.5 mil-
lion residents. Public gatherings
were banned, but it was not
known whether the measures
were only for Rangoon or for all
of Burma.

Namphy ousted in
Haiti coup Sunday

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
—- Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, a
former military adviser for the
Duvalier dictatorship, declared
himself president on Sunday af-
ter ousting Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy.

In an address on national tele-
vision early Sunday morning,
Avril said the Presidential Guard
he commands toppled Namphy
on Saturday because it was ”sick—
ened” by the way Namphy
governed. Namphy was sent to
the neighboring Dominican
Republic.

Husband suspect in
brutal slaying

BRYN MAWR, Pa. (AP) ~ A
Bryn Mawr physician who died
after police found her in her
driveway bleeding from stab
wounds had told police in the
past that her husband beat her,
Radnor Township police said
Sunday.

Police Chief Maurice Hennessy

NEWS BRIEFS

said Meena Aggarwal had report-
ed several incidents of abuse, and
her now—estranged_ husband,
Pramod Aggarwal, had been ar-
rested in connection‘ with the
complaints. At the time of the at-
tack Thursday, Ms. Ag‘garwa| was
under court protection from her
husband. 

Aggarwal has beéh charged
with the slaying, according to
police. I

Aggarwal, 43, was being held
Sunday without bail at the Dela-
ware County Prison, police said,
and faces a preliminary hearing
on murder charges Tuesday.

Report finds decline
in railroad safety

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— The na-
tion’s railroad companies have al-
lowed safety standards to become
sidetracked by economic pres-
sures to keep trains moving at all
costs, resulting in a rising number
of accidents, according to a pub-

lished report.

The Pittsburgh Press reported
in a copyrighted story Sunday
that railroad safety is being
jeopardized because supervisors
send out faulty cars without
repairs, railroad managers ignore
track defects, and warning lights,
bells and gates at grade crossings
are allowed to malfunction.

The newspaper also found,
during a nine-month investiga-
tion, that many railroad bridges
are maintained poorly and no
government agency has the
authority to inspect them.

In addition, the Federal Rail-
road Administration, the only
agency with authority to order
changes in the railroads, refuses
to act on National Transportation
Safety Board recommendations
for correcting deficiencies, ac-
cording to the newspaper.

The Press said it found that the
number of multiple-car derail-
ments and large releases of
hazardous materials last month in
the United States was up about
35 percent from August 1987.

Worker injured in

trailer explosion

LIBERTY, Pa. (AP) — A worker
whose torch apparently sparked
a tanker trailer explosion was
hospitalized in serious condition
over the weekend, according to
authorities.

William E. Dreer, 43, of
McKeesport, suffered multiple in-
juries and burns, said Elizabeth
Gribik, a nursing supervisor at
Pittsburgh's Mercy Hospital.

Dreer was using a torch Friday
to cut apart an 8,000—gallon
tanker, owned by A&P Trucking
of McKeesport, when the torch
apparently ignited Iiquidasphalt
residue in the tank, officials said.

Rocky Horror Show fans face new rules of conduct

By Erin Flynn
For The Pitt News

When The Rocky Horror Pic-
ture Show returned to The King's
Court theater in April, patrons
seemed more than happy;
however, when students this year
returned to Oakland, they were
met with a sign at the theater pro-
hibiting the props that made this
movie an exciting and unique ex-
perience.

The rumors are true that the
participation of throwing rice,
water, toast and hot dogs, and
dancing in the aisles during the
famous ”Time Warp,” is over.

Manager Steve Mahofski said

that when Rocky first arrived at
The King's Court, he had ”no
rules.” Compared to the heavy
promotions of earlier years, like
"Brad look—alike contest,” ”Bring
your mother night” and ”Best—
dressed costume award,” the at-
mosphere has calmed down. The
single reason for this change is
that, although Mahofski en-
couraged people to ”have a good
time,” he claimed that they ”took
advantage of the code of ethics.”

The first Saturday night after
classes started at Pitt, eggs were
snuck into the theater among the
rice and toast. They were thrown
at members of the floor show and

directly at the screen. A new poli-
cy of checking bags upon entry
was established, because Mahof-
ski did not want to ban the origi-
nal participation.

Last week, another egg was
thrown at the screen, and the rule
of bringing nothing into the theat-
er went into effect. Mahofski said,
”This rule might change  hope-
fully it won't stay like this forever
 but I can't have the screen
ruined.”

Does this take away from the
movie's essence? ls the impact
lessened? Where does the value
of the movie come in? One regu-
lar said, ”No, it does not take

saying that they might as well go
up to New York to see a ”real
Rocky Horror.” The audience still
relishes the movie, and true
Rocky fans still love it, but the ab-
sence of the participation is an
obvious one.

Richard O'Brien, who plays
Riff Raff in the movie, wrote the
screenplay with full attention to
the planned pauses, as well as the
music and lyrics he composed for
the film. Max Ringer, who plays
Riff in the floor show and has
seen RHPS 207 times, said, ’’I

Adolf Hundertmark, King's

Chess

Conﬁnued ﬂontpage T

Berliner said, ”A chess—move
generator is the thing that you
need most. The faster you can
generate moves, the more moves
you can look at. It was sort of like
someone serving up tennis balls
at a rate of hundreds of thousands
per second and you've got to
evaluate or hit them.”

These events led to the de-
velopment of Hitech, which start-
ed playing in 1985.

A number of things distinguish
Hitech, making it better than
other chess computers. Hitech’s
rating is already 200 points
higher than the next—highest com-
puter’s rating.

Most importantly, Hitech is
faster than any other chess com-
puter. ”We were amazed how
well it played just because it was
fast. It actually knew very little
about chess,” said Berliner.

Berliner then began adding

knowledge to the machine. Be-
fore the end of that year, Hitech

was not only the fastest, but also.

the smartest chess computer.
Hitech began to recognize cer-
tain patterns that arise in chess
games. Berliner said, ’’In chess,
patterns are very important.
Sometimes a group of three
pieces has some particular mean-
ing; they represent some strength
or some weakness. The ability to
notice that is important.”

Hitech’s winning percentage
against chess masters suddenly
rose dramatically, from 30 to 75
percent.

How do human chess players
react to playing against a com-
puter in a tournament? According
to Berliner, most people don't
mind. However, some human
players do exercise their option
to refuse to play against a
computer.

”By and large, the good play-
ers treat it with a great deal of
respect,” says Berliner. ”Hitech
causes a lot of curiosity.”

The success of Hitech has
raised questions among the chess
world about whether or not a
computer will ever become

world champion.

”Of course," says Berliner. M

”There’s no question about that.
It’s just a question of when, not
whether. I'd like to see a com-
puter that I’m associated with be
the best chess player in the
world.”

Berliner’s plans for Hitech in the

near future include a new pro- 

gram that will make it five to 10
times faster than it already is.
With this, and continuing ad-
vances in computer technology,
perhaps Berliner is right. Maybe
the real question should be
whether or not the rest of the
world will be ready for ”...the ul-
timate test of silicon fitness.”

Rocky

Continued from page 3
the movie is about. It's a differ-
ent world where everyone is who
they are, everything’s a bit bi-
zarre, and that’s OK.

The ”picture show” is univer-
sally recognized and has been
running since Sept. 26, 1975.
King's Court was one of the first
cinemas to ever premiere Rocky
Horror.

After remaining at the Court for
five years, the film moved to the
Stanley Theater for a five—week
run. On April 8, it returned to
King's Court and is presently be-
ing shown every Friday and
Saturday night at midnight.

What is The Rocky Horror Pic-
ture Show? It's the story of nerd
and his fiancee who stumble into
a castle to use the phone and find
themselves devoured in a world
of fantasy, madness and bizarre
sex.

But it's more than that. For
some, it's a movie to see out of
simple curiousity. For others, it's
home — the best, and possibly
only way to describe this movie.

According to Ringer, the origi-
nator of the Kings Court floor
show, it's ”a magical moment for
everyone. It's Rocky Horror, and
that’s it.”

Ringer says that The Rocky
Horror Picture Show will be in
Oakland for ”a long while who
knows where it can go?  Possi-
bly another ll‘/2 years’ run!”

Even talking to the extremely
cool cast of the floor show, the
magic of The Rocky Horror Pic-

ture Show is impossible to es-

cape. Originally named They
Came from Denton High, this

' movie has a flair for appealing to

the mind and arousing the senses.
It's an addictive and vibrant ex-
perience. Jerry ”Stoney Curtis”
Kurzawski, who has seen it 70
times and plays a wonderful ”Riff
Raff,” said, ”There’s nothing else
like it. There's only one Rocky
Horror.” I couldn't have put it
better myself. I'm hooked.

Now go see it for yourself. Go
with an open mind, and ”give
yourself over to absolute
pleasure.”

Heavy Joans, who has seen the
movie over 50 times, described
it as ”an old horror with a new
'70s sex twist.”

Along with the carousel of sur-
realistic characters on the screen,
a floor show is provided for ex-
tra glamour and entertainment in
the evening.

Adolf Hundertmark, the high-
light of the floor show, explains,
”We do it because we want to get
as close to the performers in the
movie as possible.”

Every character is portrayed,
along with his actions.

Hundertmark, an ”original
Rocky regular,” first saw the
movie the week afterlit opened in
1975. Since then, he has ex-
perienced it over 600 times. He
was a part of the floor show the
second time he saw it and con-
tinued to perform in New York's
stage show of Rocky Horror. He
also attended the "Tenth Annual
Rocky Horror Picture Show Birth-
day Party.”

Painted up to look like Frankie,
Adolf keeps the audience's atten-
tion throughout the movie with
his raw, sexual energy and brings
Frankie's closing song to a beau-
tiful climax. Adolf knows the part
well and watching his acting, you
get the feeling that he wants you
to leave the theater with more
than just a ticket stub.

So you are thinking about be-

‘a great

coming a part of the floor show?
Adolf said, ”No one is turned
away. If you're black and want to
be a part of the floor show, you
are welcome. We need people
for everything —— costumes, props

It's obvious that they're having
time up there.

Ah yes, the virgins. In the
Rocky Horror Dictionary, the
definition of a ”virgin” is some-
one who has never experienced
the movie. Before the show, cast

' members scout the audience for

virgins, place them on the stage
and then auction them off. But it's
all part of the fun, and that’s what
it's all about in the first place.

Since the academic year began,
freshmen and upperclassmen
alike from Pitt and CMU have
been flocking to Rocky Horror on
the weekends.

Mahofski said that it has been
”heavy on the virgins. We have
a small core of people that are al-
ways here, but if we had a gang
fight, the virgins would win.”

Two visiting ”virgins” from
Kent State University were asked
for their thoughts before the
show. One said, ’’I have a feel-
ing that l will be able to let my-
self go without feeling foolish,”
while the other expected it to be
”funny  hilarious.” After ex-
periencing the movie, their com-
ments ranged from ”fantastic”

and ’’excellent acting” to ”This
is the avant-garde way of life.”

The performers who bring this
phenomenon to life are heroes
and heroines to the audience.

Susan Sarandon plays ”la,net
Weiss  the American girl from
Denton.” The audience mocks
but adores her. Where else can
you go to a movie and be able to
scream ”slut” at_the female star
at her every entrance? Nowhere
but Rocky Horror.

Barry Bostwick portrays Brad
Majors. He's a young fool. OK —
a complete nerd, but we love him
anyway.

Along with these two romantic
leads is Rocky, played by a blond
boy named Peter Hindwood.

An appearance is also made by
a greaser named Eddie, who is
played by performer Meatloaf,
and is regularly portrayed at The
King's Court by Danny
Kozlowski. *

The most dominant force in the
movie, and enough reason alone
to go see it, is Dr. Frank-n-Furter,
played by Tim Curry.

Kate Cordaro, who considers
herself a ”regular Frankie fan”
said, ”Frankie is just so complete-
ly sexual that he appeals to both
man and woman. He's captivat-
ed my life, and it is impossible to
see the movie only once.”

Some women think they need to take an occasional

rest from the Pill-.,»So they switch to a less effective form of
birth control, and increase their chances of getting preg-
nant. Just how restful this can be is highly questionable.
What is certain, however, is that there’s no medical evi-
dence that supports this notion of taking a break. None.

There are other myths, miscon-

ceptions and questions about the
Pill. What about the Pill and breast
cancer? Although there are con-
flicting reports concerning this

SH0lllD

_ issue, the Centers for Disease Control
reported that women who took the Pill-
even for 15 years—ran no higher risk of
breast cancer than the women who didn’t.

They also reported that ovarian and uterine

cancer are substantially less common
among women on the Pill. What’s more,
Pill users are less likely to develop pelvic
inﬂammatory disease (tubal infections),

benign breast disease, and iron deficiency
anemia—not to mention menstrual cramps.
And the rumor that the Pill makes you less fertile is
just that. Rumor. Studies indicate that if you were
fertile before you took the Pill, taking it should not
affect your ability to have children later. Some women

So does the Pill have any real risks? Yes.

may experience a short period of readjust-
ment after discontinuing the Pill. But even
so, they usually become pregnant soon.

And you should know what those risks are.

For example, if you are taking the Pill, you
should not smoke. Especially if you’re over
35. Cigarette smoking is known to increase
the risk of serious and possibly life-
threatening adverse effects on the heart and

Pill?

blood vessels from Pill use. What’s more, women with cer-
tain conditions or medical histories should not use the
Pill. Even ifyou’re already on the Pill, you should see your
doctor at least once a year. And be sure to read the patient
information that’s included in every Pill package.

When it comes to birth control, the best advice is to
seek out the best advice. Go to reliable sources. Ask a lot
of questions. Discuss all the options with your doctor.

Because only then will you know where the myth ends.

And the truth begins.

Bush's attacks are  
withoutfoundation

For the past month, Michael Dukakis has been hindered
and George Bush has been helped by the issue of the Pledge

of Allegiance.

It is strange that a simple veto of a bill that would have
required teachers to lead their pupils in the pledge would
cost Dukakis so much in the polls, especially since Dukakis
claimed to be conforming to the rulings of the U.S. Supreme

Coun..

Bush's elaborate use of this issue has made Dukakis look
”unpatriotic.” However, there is a difference between not
requiring teachers to lead their students in the pledge, as
Dukakis did with his veto, and being unwilling to ”let
teachers lead the kids in the Pledge of Allegiance,” which
is what Bush claims Dukakis had done.

It is obvious, through Dukakis’ drop in the polls, that Ameri-
cans consider this issue an important one. There is no ques-
tion of the meaning that the Pledge of Allegiance can have

I for a citizen of this country. But it is a pledge, not an oath

of fealty, and to force such a pledge, under any circum-
stances, is to lose the very meaning of saying it.
Whether or not Dukakis understood this when he vetoed
the bill is unknown, but Bush's attack of Dukakis shows that
he surely does not. His use of the incident to boost his own

campaign is deplorable.

I'm waiting now, in‘ a rather
frightful state of mind, to have my
first paper of the term returned to
me in class tomorrow. I

Part of the problem lies in the
fact that I chose to write about
someone I love, an uncle who
tried to kill himself.

I remember watching a paper
being torn apart in my last English
class. A good friend of mine had
written about her brother, and
her paper had been completely
misinterpreted by the students
and the professor in the class.

They critiqued the content of
the paper and decided that the
writer must have been trying to
convey the idea that her brother
was a little less than intelligent.
Knowing the writer as well as I
did, I knew that her brother had
been accepted into Pitt's law
school and was the farthest thing

from ”stupid,” as the class had la: I"

beled him.
I noticed some changes in my
attitude towards writing after that.
For example, the prevailing
thought that I used to have when
I sat down to write something
was, ”WiIl people like this?”

When Coke and cars have something in

The following story is true; the
names have not been changed,
so as to embarrass the guilty.

Coca-Cola is perhaps the most
useful substance known to man.
Created about a century ago as a
cough syrup, it quickly became
a carbonated beverage. Some of
its many uses, so I've been told,
include being able to get dead
bugs off of a windshield and be-
ing used as an extra—strength
soap, spermicide and fire—
extinguisher substitute.

Little did I know when I was
roused early this past Saturday
morning by my good friend Jeff
that I would later be discovering
the wonderful properties of Coke.
Jeff had picked me up that fate-
ful day with the purpose of drivng
me to Erie, Pa., to pick up my
brand new 1968 Oldsmobile
Ninety-Eight, a car that my par-
ents must certainly have gotten
for me for some other reason than
being a means to transport myself
home for the holidays.

The I968 Oldsmobile Ninety-
Eight that I was on my way to
retrieve was ”faded puke—green"
according to my 10-year-old
brother, and in ’’almost perfect
condition” according to my
mother. Having been driven by
a little old lady for the past 20
years as her primary transporta-
tion to church on Sundays, the
car was sent to a garage by my

WILLIAM
YOUNG

parents for a week of repairs and
its inspection sticker.

After watching my little
brother's football team lose that
afternoon, I bid my mother fare-
well, and Jeff and I headed for
I-79 with just a little over three
hours of time before I had to meet
two friends to go see the movie
Aria at the Playhouse, followed
by a little relaxation at Heming-
way's. (By now, you can proba-
bly see what's coming.)

After scooping off some burn-
ing paper fragments that the
mechanics had somehow left on
the engine block and ignoring
Jeff's advice that we stop the car
at the next rest station to ensure
that that really was the cause of
the smoke that had been coming
in through my car's vents, Jeff and

  

I sped down the interstate, taking
turns passing each other and smil-
ing moronically with each leap-
frog. Then it happened.

For about a nanosecond’s
worth of time, I thought that the
large popping sound I heard was
one of my ”almost brand new”
tires exploding. This fleeting
thought was quickly replaced
when a plume of smoke longer

than Hailey’s Comet’s tail erupt-

ed from the back of my car and
began pouring out around the
hood. Oh good, I thought, time
to pull over again. ‘

By the time I had gotten the
hood open, Jeff had stopped his
car and run over to mine, where
I was presently admiring the
forest fire on my engine block.
Jeff looked at me and said that if
we didn't put out the fire my car
was going to explode, and that ”it
wouldn't be good.” The only fire—
fighting equipment that I had
thought to bring along was a
1969 Teac reel-to-reel tape
machine and two speakers, and
I doubted that there was enough
there to put out the fire.

Jeff, however, was a little more
prepared. Handing me a six—pack
of Coke, he quickly demonstrat-
ed proper fire-containment proce-
dure by pouring it on the engine.
Two-and-a-half cans later, the fire
was out, and I was thoroughly
chagrined. After letting the en-

gine cool down for a while, we
slowly disassembled the few
parts of the engine that we knew
how to put back together and dis-
covered that the bottom radiator
hose had ruptured (I wasn't even
aware that such a hose existed
until Jeff pointed it out to me).

Jeff asked me what I thought
we should do, and with my new-
ly acquired 45 minutes of
mechanical knowledge, I told
him that we should tape up the
rupture. We then washed up with
another can of Coke (remarkably,
it breaks up engine grease like
nothing) and drank the last one.
After moving the car about a mile
up the road we locked it up and
headed to Cieneva/Cochranton,
Pa. in search of a phone.

We found one next to Virgil’s
Bar, just off Exit 35. It was now
7:30 p.m., and I should have
been in Oakland for about five
minutes if everything had gone
right. When I informed my
mother of the problem .and told
her that I wanted the car towed
to somewhere, she told me to call
her back in a half-hour while she
consulted her father, the Mr. Fix-
it in my family tree.

Jeff and I now had a half-hour
to kill, so we headed into Virgil’s.
Now, Virgil’s is like any stereo-
typical cowboy bar in Pennsylva-
nia, which is to say that when Jeff
and I walked in, every head

Now I'm more concerned with
”Will this be grossly misinter-

I recognized a little injustice
occurring that day. I witnessed a
group of readers arrogant enough

to decide that they had stumbled 3

upon the only possible interpre— ‘

I wouldn’t-try to fool myself
into believing that I had the abil-
ity to get inside of someone else’s
head that way.

I wrote about my uncle be-

very strong effect on me, and I

have to ask myself whether it was

turned and watched us as we sad-
dled up to the bar.

Two beers later, I headed back
to the phone to tell Mom that I
was in a hurry to get back to Pitts-
burgh and that we could take
care of the car the next day. No
dice. My grandfather had already
left and was heading for the
Geneva exit ramp (a measly hour
and a half from his home), and
my mom was going to be on her
way in just a few minutes.

It was now that Virgil’s began
to get on my nerves. The beard-
ed, beer-bellied guy sitting next
to me was talking quite loudly to
another bearded, beer-bellied
guy about Miller Beer being the
only real ” ’merican beer.” I had
a Coors Light. There were sever-
al ”road signs” on the wall that
made it painfully clear that cows
were not allowed to fornicate or
go to the bathroom on the
premises (clearly the reason there
were no cows in the bar).

Around 10 p.m., my mom
showed up, and we went out to
the car to watch my grandfather
tell me that there was something
wrong and that I had to take the
car to my relatives in Clintonville
so that it could get fixed.

Four hours later, I opened the
door to my apartment, sat down

Panthers pass first test of season, beat OSU 42-10

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

After defeating Syracuse 26-9
two weeks ago, the Ohio State
Buckeyes were expected to give
the Pitt Panthers a run for their
money last Saturday night at Pitt
Stadium.

It was also supposed to be the
first real test for the young Pan-
thers after defeating Northern
Iowa, a Division I-AA school,
59-10 on Sept. 3.

As it was, Pitt (ranked 20th by
UPI) proved that they are a team
to be reckoned with after com-
pleting a 42-10 domination of
OSU (ranked 17th by UPI).

”To say the least, this game
was a big turnaround from last
week,” OSU coach John Cooper
said. ”They out-coached us and
out-played us in every aspect of
the game. Everything they did
worked, and they were prepared
for everything we did.”

The Pitt offense was paced by
tailback Adam Walker's three
touchdowns and 179 rushing
yards. The bright spot for the
Buckeyes was quarterback Greg
Frey’s 142 passing yards.

Senior linebacker Jerry Ol-
savsky led the Panther defense
with eight tackles. Defensive end
Camel Smith had the lone Pan-
ther sack. The Buckeye defense
was led by Andy Gurd, Zack Du-
mas and Srecko Zizakovic, each
with nine tackles.

The game started out just as Pitt
would have planned. Defensive
back Cornell Holloway intercept-
ed a pass on the third play from
scrimmage, and four plays later
Walker was in the end zone.

”The early interception sparked
us and got us going,” Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried said. ”Then our
offense was able to take it in and
get seven points. I think that set
the tone for the game."

Walker scored his second
touchdown four minutes later,

Darnell Dickerson could do no wrong in Pitt's 42-10 victory over Ohio State Saturday night at Pitt Stadium.

and the Panthers had a quick
14-01 lead.

The Buckeye’s Pat O’Morrow
booted a 26-yard field goal with
three minutes left in the first
quarter to cut the score to 14-3.
It was the closest OSU would get
all day.

Panther quarterback Darnell
Dickerson and Walker then took
over, combining for 71 rushing
yards between them on a 75-yard

TD drive. Dickerson capped it off
with a nifty 18-yard scamper off
the option play to make it 21-3
early in the second quarter.
”The touchdown was a play
that worked perfectly,” Dicker-
son said. ”I had to try and read
the blocks and hopefor the best.

Notes from Pitt's 42-1 0 victory
over No. 17 Ohio State at Pitt
Stadium Saturday night:

0 Following a 148—yard, two-
touchdown performance against
Northern Iowa, junior Adam
Walker once again sparkled at
the tailback slot, rushing for 179
yards and three touchdowns
against the Buckeyes.

Walker gave all the credit for
his performance to Pitt's front
line. ”The offensive line was ter-
rific,” Walker said. ”They execut-
ed plays very well. It's a
running back’s dream."

Walker ran for 122 yards and
all three scores prior to halftime.

Pitt ground out 362 total rush-
ing yards on 65 carries.

Pitt running backs have now
rushed for at least 100 yards in 14
consecutive games.

0 In contrast, Ohio State's run-
ning backs rushed for a com-
bined total of‘ 91 yards.

Sophomore tailback Carlos Snow
led all Buckeye backs with 33
yards on five rushing attempts.
Senior Vince Workman added 23
yards. 1

Surprisingly, Ohio State's huge
offensive line — averaging 6-5
and 281 pounds — could not
hold up against the young Pitt
defense.

Senior middle linebacker Jerry
Olsavsky, who earlier last week

PANTHER

NOTEBOOK

said he was somewhat worried
about the size of the Buckeye
blockers, had a different perspec-
tive after the win.

”Older guys on this team
played against bigger offensive
lines before,” he said. And as for
the youthfulness of the rest of the
defense — freshmen starting line-
backers Ricardo McDonald and
Curtis Bray in particular — Ol-

savsky said, ”They’re not young
anymore. They just show up to
play.”

0 Pitt coach Mike Gottfried was
also encouraged with the
progress of the younger players
on his team. ’’I was really pleased
with the way our younger play-
ers played,” Gottfried said.

Gottfried said last week that he
was concerned with possible mis-
matches between OSU and
younger Pitt players.

But Pitt's underclassmen shone
in the game. Freshman receiver
Baron Jackson accounted for the
last touchdown of the game on a
39-yard pass reception from Lar-
ry Wanke.

Running back Curvin Richards
rushed for 38 yards on 11 carries,
Ricky Turner 1 5 yards on three at-
tempts and redshirt freshman
Ronald Redmon 1 1 yards on one
carry.

Freshman receiver Chris Bouy—
er also caught one pass, from
Wanke, for a gain of five yards.

zone/’

The rest of the second quarter
belonged to the Panthers. Walk-
er scored his third touchdown at
the two-minute mark, and Pitt
was up 28-3.

”They are a very good defen-
sive football team,” Walker said.
”I just wanted to go out and play
to the best of my ability. Ifl know
that I gave 100 percent, then I'm
satisfied.”

Ohio State tried to make a
comeback at the end of the half,
but the Pitt defense held strong.

The Buckeyes got the ball at
their own 29 and moved all the
way to the Pitt 14, but a succes-
sion of penalties took them back
to the 44 with five seconds to
play. On the third and 40, Frey’s
pass fell untouched at the buzzer.

Pitt went into the half with a 25
point lead.

”They [OSU] were very con-
fused,” Holloway said. ”They
thought we were blitzing some-
times and we didn't, and they
were audibling things that we
had coverage on. We had them
coming and going.”

Pitt started the second half with
the ball but were forced to punt

after three plays. Ohio State got
the ball at their own 42.

The Buckeyes quickly drove
down the field and made it to the
goal line. On second down, Frey
handed the ball to tailback Vince
Workman, who fumbled the ball
into the end zone. Holloway
recovered the ball to end the
threat.

different ballgame,” Frey said.
”That was a big factor. It seems
that's how the whole game went
for us.”

The defenses took over and the
teams traded punts. The quarter
ended with Pitt on the OSU 20-
yard line and a 28-3 lead.

”The past couple of weeks, we
have worked on the Ohio State
defense, and everything we ran
worked out pretty good,” Dick-
erson said. ”Our timing is com-
pletely down now. We're
working together as a team, and
everything is all right.

’’I don't think they had any
weaknesses on their defense; we
just have a great offense.”

After a missed 29-yard Van
Horne field goal, OSU running
back Canlos Snow gave the ball
right back with a fumble.

Four plays later, Dickerson

put Pitt up 35-3.

”Dickerson hurt us a lot,’’
Buckeye linebacker Mike
McCray said. ”We thought we
could contain him. He didn't hurt
us with his throwing. He hurt us
with his running.”

After a Buckeye punt put the
ball on the Pitt 42, Dickerson was
replaced by sophomore Larry
Wanke, who saw action in a
mop—up role.

Three plays later, Wanke con-
nected with freshman receiver
Baron Jackson for a 39-yard TD
pass. Pitt was up 42-3 and on the
way to being 2-0 on the season.

But Ohio State had one big
play left. On the ensuing kickoff,
Snow fought his way through a
number of tackles, carrying the
ball 100 yards downfield and into
the end zone.

Pitt controlled the ball for the

next eight minutes, and when

THE PITT N ws, ivlonday, September 19, 1988

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

”The biggest difference be-
tween this year's team and last
year’s team,” says Ken Anderson,
former All-Pro quarterback for the
Cincinnati Bengals, ”is that the
defense is stopping teams late in
the game.”

Already, the 3-0 Bengals have
three-fourths as many wins this
year than they did in all of 1987,
the latest being a 17-12 victory
over the turnover-plagued Pitts-
burgh Steelers.

Led by a stingy defense and
quarterback Boomer Esiason’s
two touchdown passes, Cincin-
nati has leaped to the top of the
wacky AFC Central after finishing
last season a miserable 4-11,
while Pittsburgh falls to 1-2.

”|t’s a tough loss for us, no
question about that,” said Steel-
ers coach Chuck Noll. ”One of
our problems was turning the ball
over as many times as we did.”

Pittsburgh committed six tur-
novers, including a stretch in the
second quarter when it fumbled
on three consecutive possessions.

”The Bengals did an excellent
job stripping us of the ball; those
[turnovers] just don't happen.
Give them a lot of credit,” Noll
said.

”No question it was the
defense’s day,” said Esiason.
”|’ve never seen a Bengal pass
rush as fierce as it was today. The
defense just kept coming up with
the big plays. They showed they
have pride out there.”

Steeler quarterback Bubby
Brister’s ill-timed toss intended
for Rodney Carter with 1:03 left
in the game didn't help Pitts-
burgh’s cause much either.

Trailing 17-12, a 25-yard punt
return by Rod, Woodson gave
Pittsburgh possession on its own
48 with 1:54 remaining to play.
Brister promptly hit wide receiver
Weegie Thompson over the mid-
dle for 22 yards to the Bengal 30.
Five plays later, Cincinnati cor-
nerback Eric Thomas stepped in
front of Carter at the 8-yard line
and came up with the game-
saving interception, Brister’s se-
cond of the game.

’’I should have thrown it either
earlier or later than I did. I just
picked the wrong time to let it
go,” said Brister.

The Steelers have lost two con-
secutive games after a season-
opening win over the Dallas
Cowboys.

Pittsburgh started the scoring
early in the first quarter on some-
what of a bizarre play. Corner-
back Lewis Billups thwarted the
first Steelers drive by picking off
a Brister pass deep in Cincinnati
territory. Then, on the third and
11, Esiason rolled out into the
end zone looking for a receiver
down the right sideline. His pass
fell incomplete, but right guard
Max Montoya was whistled for
holding.

National Football League rules
state that any offensive penalty
committed while the ball is in the
end zone results in an automatic
safety.

2-0 Pittsburgh, top of the first.

After Earnest Jackson’s second-
quarter fumble at the Steelers’
37-yard line, Boomer Esiason
needed only four plays to get the
Bengals on the board, as he hit
running back Stanley Wilson for
a 13-yard touchdown pass to put
his team up 7-2.

Pittsburgh came out firing in
the second half, moving 66 yards

in 10 plays and scoring on a
9-yard shot from Brister to wide
receiver Louis Lipps. Troy John-
son, a wide receiver recently
claimed from waivers, rescued
the Steelers on a third-and-14 sit-
uation by hauling in a 32-yard
pass from Brister.

The teams then exchanged
field goals — a 32-yarder by the
Bengals’ Jim Breech and a
19-yarder from Gary Anderson —
before Cincinnati took the lead
for good.

On first and 10 at their own 35.,
the Steelers defense showed blitz,
and Esiason knew exactly what to
do for the situation.

”As soon as he knew what [the
Steelers] were doing, Boomer au-
dibled at the line,” said Bengals
wide receiver Eddie Brown.

Brown, who led the NFL in
receiving yardage coming into
the contest, was faced with sin-
gle coverage by Pittsburgh cor-
nerback Delton Hall.

for several long touchdown pass-
es in both the 1988 preseason
and regular season.

’’I made a down-middle post
move on Delton, and [Esiason]
was able to get the ball off.”

The mercuric Brown ran the
route unscathed, Esiason put the
spiral on target, and then a 12-10
deficit quickly became a 17-12 fi-
nal score.

Pittsburgh gained three more
possessions after that point, but
the Bengals defense stripped run-
ning back Dwight Stone on the
first, sacked Brister on the se-
cond, then made the final inter-
ception to end the game.

Brister completed 15 of his 30
passes for 235 yards, while Esia-
son hit 15 of 27 for 223 yards.

”We’re still a young team, and

hunt”

We started out with a very sim-
ple idea.

To make electronic typewriters
and word processors that have lots
of great features but are very simple

. to use.

So simple you
don't have to keep
one eye on your
typing and one eye
on the instruction
manual.

So simple you
don't need a degree
in computer pro-
gramming to operate them.

So simple they can even make
a conﬁrmed non-typist comfortable
at the keyboard.

Call it human engineering if you
like. Or call it ergonomics. Orcall it
plain old inspiration.

What we came up with is a
line of remarkable typewriters that
are sophisticated without being
complicated.

In fact, they're unlike any other
typewriters you've ever seen before...

 

We make
the simplest

It features a 7,000 character

On the SD 700, as well as on
every new Smith Corona typewriter,
you'll find our new correcting
cassette.

lt’s easy-to-load and you can
insert it in seconds.

There are no spools to
unwind. No complicated threading.
No tangles.

So now correcting mistakes
is as easy as making them.

yards and ran for 88 yards and
two scores.

Dickerson was particularly ef-
fective at executing the option
play. But he, like Walker, defers
his rate of success to the offensive
line. ”You’ve got to give all the
credit to the line. Without the

, line, the option wouldn't work.”

0 OSU quarterback Greg Frey,
despite completing only nine of
29 passes, also had his ssmniil
solid game in as many outings as
a starter. He passed for 142 yards
while under constant pressure
from the Pitt defense.

”They figured we were young,
so we knew they were going to
come out [throwing]/’ said Pitt
senior cornerback Cornell Hollo-
way. But the Panther secondary
stifled the OSU air attack for most
of the game, the longest play be-
ing a 36-yard completion from
Frey to split end Wes Siegen-
thaler.

Holloway intercepted a Frey
pass intended for Siegenthaler on
the third play from scrimmage
and covered a Workman fumble
in the Pitt end zone in the fourth
quarter, as OSU threatened on a
second down and goal from the
one-yard line.

0 The brightest play of the
game for Ohio State was Snow's
100-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown in the fourth quarter.
Unfortunately for the Buckeyes,
it was too little, too late.

The last kickoff return for a
touchdown against the Panthers
was Blair Thomas’ 91-yard return
at Penn State in 1986.

0 Pitt's wide margin of victory
over Ohio State sets up an in-
teresting scenario for the contest
against West Virgina at Pitt Stadi-
um next Saturday.

Twelfth-ranked WVU is off to
a 3-0 start, including a 55-24
trouncing of Maryland on Satur-
day. Pitt is now 2-0, and after hav-
ing survived what has been called
their first big test, the Panthers
have gained a new measure of
respect and confidence.

”We upped our confidence a
lot,” Dickerson said.

But the team wants to keep this
win in perspective as the heart of
Pitt's schedule — successive
games against West Virginia,
Boston College and Notre Dame

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September l9, T988

Olsa vsky

 doesn't

show roots
in Pitt win

" By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Senior linebacker Jerry Ol-
savsky anchored a rock-ribbed
Panther defensive unit on Satur-
day evening, as Pitt rolled to a
42-10 victory over the Ohio State
Buckeyes.

Playing against a massive Ohio

S State offensive line, which aver-

aged 6-foot 5-inches and 280
pounds, Pitt, led by Olsavsky’s
three unassisted tackles and five
assists, was able to diminish their
effectiveness.

Olsavsky thought that ex-
perience and perseverance
played a large role in the Panthers
holding the Buckeyes to 233
yards of total offense for the
game.

”The older guys on our defense
have played against large offen-
sive lines like Notre Dame and
Ohio State before. We knew we
could play against them and it
came out well. They were lean-
ing on us a lot in the first half; we
knew if we kept sticking them in
the second half, we would come
out ahead,” said Olsavsky.

For Olsavsky, the Panther’s vic-
tory had to be particularly sweet.
Four years ago, the 6-2, 218
pounder finished up a standout
career at Chaney High School in
Youngstown, Ohio, only to find
out that Pitt was the only major
college interested in recruiting
him.

At the end of the game Ol-
savsky commented, ’’I knew a
couple of guys from over there
[Ohio State]. You always like to
win against your hometown
guys.”

With a young defensive unit,
the Panthers look to Olsavsky for
leadership. Indicative of that
leadership was the game's first
play from scrimmage. Buckeye
quarterback Greg Frey took Over
the controls on his own 20. He
went back to pass, but the ball
was deflected away from the in-
tended receiver by Olsavsky.

That play wasto characterize
the Pitt defensive intensity for the
evening.

Olsavsky emerged from the
game with confidence in his
teammates. ”The young kids who
play alongside me are not young,
anymore. They show up to play,”
he noted.

Despite the big win in front of
a full house at Pitt Stadium as
well as a national television au-
dience, Olsavsky strives to keep
the game in perspective.

”You don't want to get a big
head. We try to take one game at
a time and stay on an even keel
at all times," observed Olsavsky.

During his career at Pitt, Ol-
savsky has been a consistently
hard-working performer. He has
proven the college recruiters who
thought that he was not talented
enough wrong. I

Olsavsky has started for the
Panthers for the last three sea-
sons, and this season, he could
become the first player since Ar-
nie Weatherington (1974-1976)
to record 100 or more tackles in

three consecutive seasons.
Please  Olsavsky, page 14

Ohio native Jerry Olsavsky didn't let state pride stand in his way Saturday night.

Strong performances in big
games has been a trademark of
Olsavsky at Pitt. As a sophomore,
he recorded 17 tackles against
Notre Dame. Last season, both
Notre Dame and Penn State were
victimized by Olsavsky to the
tune of 1 7 tackles. Small wonder
that he emerged from the Ohio
State game as the team's leading
tackler.

1$OIIO:OIOZ

Olsavsky’s play has not gone
by unnoticed. He was selected as
a preseason All-East performer by
Athlon. Meanwhile, the Sporting
News had him ranked as the
14th—best inside linebacker in the
country.

”We strive for perfection at
Pitt,” Olsavsky said.

Olsavsky’s play in the first two
games of the season has done
nothing to discredit his ranking as
one of the better linebackers in
college football.

”We have two wins, but we
can't savor it,” Gottfried said.
”lt’s another step for us, but it's
too early in the season.”

Olsavsky concurred. "We have’

to keep this win in perspective
and take the next one.”

0 Pitt racked up 504 yards to
Ohio State's 233 yards, despite a
5-2 Buckeye defense geared to
stop the run. Dickerson had an
explanation. ’’I thought they had
a pretty good defense,” he said.
”We just had a great offense.”

0 Alonzo Hampton was ranked
third nationally in punt return
yardage prior to Saturday's game.

North Alabama. ”But with the
way we've played defensively
late in the game, that hasn't been
the case this year. We're finally
believing that we are a good foot-
ball team.”

And with the way the surpris-
ing Cincinnati Bengals have
played so far in 1988, a lot of
other people are starting to be-
lieve right along with them.

NOTES: Offensive lineman John
Rienstra suffered a broken leg in
the game and is expected to be
out for 5-6 weeks.

You must be a healthy non-smoking
heterosexual male or female student
between the ages of I8-29. A short in-
terview and I morning session will be
required, and blood samples will be
taken. You will also be monetarily
compensated for your time. For more
information, call Leslie or
leave a message after 5 PM at
