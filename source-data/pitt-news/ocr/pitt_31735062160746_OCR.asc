Triferm Head Meets Questions
‘Pitt Stadium Leased

On Five Year Basis

The University of Pittsburgh has consented to lease Pitt
Stadium to the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh

for a period of ﬁve years.

The University will receive. $100,000 each year under the
condition that rentals reach that amount.

The action was taken with the understanding that the
stadium would not lose its tax-0 »

exempt status as far as local
taxes are concerned.

The Auditorium Authority is

r proceeding with plans to build a

municipal stadium. A committee

appointed by the mayor and

county commissioners is now at

"work on a study to be submitted
at mid-summer.

Pitt events will receive top pri-
ority over events “of sub-tenants.”
The University will maintain the
stadium year round.

The text of the chancellor’s
statement regarding leasing of the
stadium follows: “I have been
studying the. question of the use
of the University stadium by civic
groups for several weeks.

“The trustees and I have heard
every group that volunteered an
,_ opinion. I have talked with fac-
V ulty committees," the National‘,Col,-

 legiate:-gthletic Association, and

a great many
lnufiity. , . ..
“The Public Auditorium Author-
ity has now asked to lease our sta-
dium~ for the use of a number of
community organizations.

“We understand this to be a re-
quest for a short-term lease pend-
ing the design and construction of
a permanent municipal stadium

" which ‘would house all of these ac-
tivities. '

..‘;After .a..careful analysis of the

people in the com-

situation, _. I -have . recommended,

_  Authority‘ because it will beneﬁt

“The background of our decision
is important. We recall that many
Pittsburghers expressed their con-
ﬁdence in the University by in-
vesting in construction of the sta-
dium when it was built in 1925.

“We know that many groups
such as the Civic Light Opera, the
Steelers, and other community
groups would appreciate the use
of the stadium until such time as
a municipal stadium is available
to them. 1

“Again, any responsible educa-
tor cannot ignore the fact that‘by
receiving a rental which will
spread the cost of maintenance of
the stadium to civic groups as
well as to the University, we will
in ‘fact, add very substantially to
the University’s annual. budget.

_ “This can  put to good advan-
tagein faculty salaries, in library
improvement, and‘ in other ’?Uni-

versity programs. As’ far as ama-
‘ teur ‘athletics are concerned, I can

see no threat to our amateur status
from the use of these facilities on
one weekend by our teams, and on
another by professional teams.

Jones Sees
Alternative  
In Calendar

By MILLARD AIVIDUR

Dr. Putnam Jones stated
that the trimester calendar
which has been published
was arranged for sake of il-
lustration only.

Jones, dean of the Graguate
School and chairman of the tri-
mester calendar committee, made
this statement when asked why
only one was published. The leaf-
let to parents and students on the
trimester explicitly states that
other calendars were being con-
sidered.

The committee upon request of
the faculty and other interested
parties had studied other 'plaIlS,
including three 16 week sessions
with 10 days vacations betweéfl
each.

Other proposals were trimes-
ter with one of the sessions be-
ginning at a time close to or im-
mediately after the high school
graduations, a quarter system,
and anexpandcd summer ses-_
sion.

— When asked if these’ programs,
are still inconsideration, the dean»

answered that the-I, assignment ot__  "o’~"““
‘ the _—. c—ommittec_ 3'was to - *determi‘ne‘- J-t 

the feasibility of the program.’
Consequently, members were
bound to discuss all proposals and

not necessarily determine the ac- '.

tual one to be put. into effect. _
“_Howcver," he continued, “Of
the various ways of using twelve

months or the year for educa- ’ 

tion, the three semester plan ,
seenw more likely to do it. Both
quarter and expanded summer
sessions continue the implicit ”

I

assumption in our culture that. ’ ‘

summer months are excluded
for education.  * 0 " S
Jones remarked that the article‘
in the New York Times on the
trimester proposals, also contain-
ing the “illustrative” dates, was
obtained through the samerelease
issued to Pittsburgh» newspapers '

_ The dean was referring to an
article in last Sunday’s educa-
tion section of the Times. The
graph which was included with
the announcement of the pro-
gram “must have been their
own work.”

Dr. Jones asserted that the com-
mittee had not determined how
much in additional scholarship
and loan funds would be allocated
but that the University did recog-
nize the need for such increases
with the trimester program.

The chairman said that the
committee’s view on students’
staying out to work for a tri-
mester other than the spring
trimester was that during these
periods less competition for jobs
existed.

At Florida Hotels, and Golf
Clubs, one member noted, a job
might be more readily had in fall
a‘ winter.

In connection with the ques-
tion which asked if students’
r graduating at an earlier age
wiiould affect employment op-

, portunities, Jones reaffirmed the

committees opinion.
He claimed that the trimester

, committee had debated at length

this question and in spite of the
present recession and the likeli-
hood that the scramble for en-
gineer’s is temporarily at a stand-
still, Elvis Starr, vice-chancellor
for the professions, believes that
the long range picture is still re-
assuring for young graduates.
Vice-chancellor Starr present-
ed to the committee a chart
which indicated “strikingly”
how the trained manpower in
the lower age brackets will be
lacking sufficient strength for
the next 20 years.

‘The committee, however, had
not contacted industry directly
for ‘opinions on job opportunities
in the future. A

In answer to a query as to

.. whether there is any possibility

of restrictions being arranged on
which trimester the student
.would miss if he didn’t desire to
take the full program Jones an-
swered, “The committee has
felt that the student’s freedom
of choice should not be curtailed
in any way.” ' A
The chairman w a s a s k e d
whether the committee has data
on the cost of entering such a pro-
gram, and he stated that this will
be an integral part of the report
to the chancellor, but that no par-
ticulars are as yet available.
“ “Furthermore,” said’ Dean Jones,

ble, it could not be ‘released to

“I don”: know what the chan-
cellor’s plans will be as to publi-

city for the committee’s report. It
will be released within a reason-
ably short time. He, with approval
of Board of Trustees, will make
the" decision as to whether the
program should be accepted.”

The decision~making ‘ is not
the prerogative of the trimester
calendar committee, merely to
determine the feasibility. The
committee had to name advan-
tages as a possible reason for
even considering the program.

On Dr. Jones’ desk were sum-

lected by the trimester group, data

Four men are vieing for the

Herm Joy, Ted Noethling, Ron
Goldstein are the other candi-
dates.

> George Schoeppner has the
inside track for the second base
position. Billy Martin, Nick
Stancampanio, Norm‘ Bretani,
and Dick Holiday are other
hopefuls for the keystone.

Only two men are trying for the
third base position. Pat Bonacci is
the lone veteran at the position.
Joe Zoch is the other contender.

Five Seek Catching Berth

Jim Dunlap is a returning let-
terman at shortstop. Pete Colan-
gelo and John O’Mara are sopho-

  

mores trying for the slot.

Five men are seeking the
catching berth with letterman
Fred Delost leading the ﬁeld.
George ’Zanicopoulous, Bill
Jacob, Ed Sowinski, and Fred

Lanningham, are the other can-
didates.

The pitching presents a particu-
lar problem of having at least four
front-line hurlers to meet the
schedule of doubleheaders.

Bill Hamilton, Bill Gilmore, and
John Marabelli are the only ex-
perienced pitchers Coach Lewis
will have to pick the rest of his
staff from John Reichenbauch,
Rich Wirth, Gene Ort, Ron
D’Amico, Bob Conti, and Bob
Shearer.

Ron Hoover is Lewis’ only let-
terman in the outfield. The rest of
the outﬁelders will have to be
chosen from Nick Kartsonas, John

SMOKE RINGS come in all shapes and sizes. Like 4-sided
smoke rings for squares. Sturdy smoke rings for windy
days. Even invisible smoke rings for people ‘who aren’t
ostentatious. As any competent smoke ringer (Vapor
Shaper in Stickleee!) will tell you, the best way to start
one is to light up a Lucky. It's best mostly becausea i
Lucky tastes best. A Lucky gives you naturally light,
wonderfullygood-testing tobacco, toasted to taste even

- better. Why settle for less? You'll say a light smoke’s the
right smoke for you! * »
