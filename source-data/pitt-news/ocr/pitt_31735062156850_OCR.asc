Prague Deaths

New York, N. Y.-——International
Students Day, commemorating the

eighth anniversary of the massa-
cre of Prague students by the

Nazis, will be observed by col-
leges and universities throughout
the wm .l on Monday, Nov. 17.
The world-wide holiday will

Subsiisiece ‘Levels Drop

Lafayette Waits

Panther lnvasion

Pi’rtCheering
Section Small

Only a meager portion of the
expected 25,000 fans at Satur-
day’s Purdue game will be Pitt
rooters, if ticket sales here are
any indication. A Wednesday
check at the Athletic Ticket Office
showed a total of only ﬁfty paste-
boards sold for tomorrow’s fray
at Lafayette, Indiana.

Rumors of student-chartered
bu.ses for the trip appeared to be
without foundation, and it was
believed that any excursions to
Indiana would be by private car.

In spite of the small loc-al rep-
resentation, some cheerleaders ac-
companied the band wh_en the
musicians left at 8 a.m. today. The
team and coaching staff left last
night after a‘ car-caravan to the
station provided a royal send-off
for the gridders.

According to Gulf Tourguide
Service, take U. S. 30 out to
Mansﬁeld, Ohio, following the
North leg of 30 from there to
Van Wirt, 0. -From Van Wirt
Route 224 leads into Hunting-
don, Indiana. From Hunting-
don, follow Route 24 until it
meets 25 at Logansport. Route
24 leads directly into Lafayette,
which is only a few miles from
Purdue campus at West Laf-
ayette. ‘

Band Embarks
This Morning

Pitt’s band, 148 strong, took off

this morning via four buses for
Lafayette, Ind., on" its second road
jaunt. In their ﬁrst foreign en-
gagement this year the Pittites
put on a performance that had the
Michiganders gasping. _
 The Panther and cheerleaders
will also wend their way to Pur-
dueland and display their gyra-
tions. ,

Getting ready for their pre-
game and half-time performances

at Purdue the steppers put in 55,-‘

65O man minute or upwards of a
thousand man—hour preparation.

In writing 50 parts for the in-
struments, the music writers spent
2250 minutes. Twelve hundred
minutes were required in ﬁguring
out the formations, placing the
men, and calculating th.. number
of steps needed to get them in pd-
sition while keeping the instru-
ments in their proper order.

The directors spent 480 minutes
drilling the band in the forma-
tions. This long tough task was
done to entertain during the five
minute pre-game strut and the 12
minute halftime demonstration.

To show for this grind, the mu-
sic-makers have some intricate
formations and well developed
popular and marching melodies to

impress the Boilermaker fans.

Wa|IaceStatesWorld

And Politica “Views

A deﬁnite interest in the 1948 elections was indicated by
Henry VVal1ace in his speech at Carnegie Music Hall Tuesday
afternoon. \Vhe.ther he considers running as a candidate on a
third party ticket was left undecided. ,

Opening his speech, Mr. VVallace congratulated the stu-

in 1799.

He is convinced that war is not
in the near future. “America is
enormously the strongest nation
in the world,” he said, and also
stated that nob-ody is going to at-
tack this country within the. next
ﬁve years. However, he warned,
America still ought to work for
peace. '

Outlining the items sought by
his political backers, he stressed
peace as primary and mandatory.
“Peace can be had,” he said, “for
Russia will not attack.”

Social experiments in Palestine,
viewed by Mr. Wallace on his re-
cent trip overseas, are “. . .
‘worthy of our study to find out
how to apply these concepts in
America.” Cvoncemiing the Rus-
sian-American agreement on the
Palestine problem, he thought it
might be “. . . a straw in the
wind” indicating future relation-
ships. ' .

Wallace also expressed a belief
that military men ought not to
formulate foreign policy and
thought that, if America had to
have a soldier-president, General

Eisenhower would be the best.

Sixteen sororities on campus
pledged thirty-four women early.
this week, at the termination of
the. fall rushing period.

A statistical analysis of these

ﬁgures reveals’ that, despite the
fact that three sororities did no-t
rush this fall, the average increase
per sorority is 2.1 girls. This ﬁg-
ure is below that the the same

‘NSA Has Something-
Vifhen almost 800 men and women travel
thousands of miles at the expense of 400 col-
leges and universities to attend a conference,
something of interest must be taking place.

September of this year saw 800 students pile
out of trains, planes", and automobiles at Madi-
son, Wisconsin, to put weight behind the larg-
est student movement in the history of this
country—potentially the largest in world his-
tory.

_By name, these collegiate pioneers go as the
“National Student Association”-——NSA. Their
aims, generally, include sponsorship of -the
World Student Service Fund, sponsorship of
exchange scholarships and travel forstudents,
establishing racial equality, and, most import-
ant, the extended ﬁght for student rights.

This last term, student rights, is as nebulous
as school spirit. The NSA deﬁnes it as the
right of students to conduct their lives, their
college activities and theirstudies with com-

plete freedom. Freedom, in this case, means
“without fear of academic reprisal.”

N SA feels that the student should be able to
hear whomever he would like to hear, say,
within bounds, what he would like to say, have
a word in the establishment of academic pro-
cedures since he’s paying forhis education and
‘ ‘ professor-
ial dislike” grades. ,
.- =l= It I‘

Although thoroughly forwarned, last year’s
Student Congress did not see ﬁt to send an ob-
server to the ﬁrst meetings of this group in
December, 1947; For some reason, no one was
sent to the September conference, either.

We think it is about time that Pitt stu-
dents look into this “momentous movement.”

This year ’s Student Congress has taken strides,

no other recent group has attempted to take.
In short, they have asked and obtained some
measure of satisfaction on the question of ath-
letics. They have brought up the question of
political speakers—pro and con-‘——W_ith an. eye
toward education. They should ﬁnd out what
other college students think ‘and’ feel concern-
ing mutual issues by sending a representative
or two to Madison next summer.

lVe advocate sending an observer, if conser-
vatismﬁis the Congress ‘decision. It’s a cinch
we can’t lose anything by having a.look—see
into the workings of this student movement.
In fact, we might gain something far above the
petty victories here ‘on campus.

Room For All

Student Congress meets every Tuesday af-
ternoon at 3:30 p. m. --in the Braun room on
the 12th ﬂoor of the ‘Cathedral. Spectators
are welcomed and encouraged.

It is evident from the Letters column to-
day that not everyone is familiar with the
foregoing information. ‘ A’

The Braun room is usually able to accom-
modate all those who wish to view Congress
proceed.ings. When, however, the audience
does overﬂow this room, the Congress adjourns
to whatever larger room is available.»

We hope'that more students will take an
interest in the workings of the Congress and
thereby promote better government.

‘Student Appeas For

Educational

Freedom

The pusilanimous attitude of
the administration towards the
offer of Henry Wallace to address
the student body is thoroughly
discouraging to those of us who
came to this school for an educa-
tion. Any public ﬁgure, whofcan
attract an audience should be per-
mitted to spveak.iCerta-inly if we
permitted our lawn-to be littered‘
with “unconquered” trash, there
should be no objection to hearing
Wallace, Taft, Stassen or any man
prominent in the political or eco-
nomic, world- today. Recently there

Gazette a reprint of an article
from Harper’s Magazine by Henry
Steele Commanger‘ relevant to
this situation. Especially pertinent
is this excerpt. _

f‘We expect hysteria from Mr.
Rankin and some newspapers; we
are shocked when we see educat-
ors, timid before criticism and
confused about ﬁrst principles,»-
betraytheir trust. And we wonder
what can bevthat ‘Philosophy of
Education’ which believes that
young people can be trained to
the duties of citizenshipby wrap-
ping their minds in cotton—woo1.”

I realize that Pitt is a state en-
dowed school a-n-d that if Henry

here, the Pittsburgh Press and
Sun-Telegraph would rise ‘in their
holy fury to condemn the institu-
tion. Nevertheless, if in-tellectual
leadership does not come from, the
schools, where can we ﬁndgit? Or‘
is this an admission that the edu-
cation we are now receiving does
not render us capable of accepting
a truth and rejecting a lie?

Tuck Shop.Mob i

Editor, Pitt News

Ivam a law student who often
attempts to lunch in the tuck
shops. They have always been
crowded at noon, but recently
conditions seem to have worsened.
I am therefore writing to the
Deans, the Student Congress and
the *News with the hope that
someone may have _some con-
structive suggestions.

My speciﬁc complaint is th"at
at noon only, a small part of the
seats are occupied by people who

are“lunching. The -rest" are _en- ’

and in ostensible study. Blocs of
undergraduates‘ monopolize whole‘
tables for nothing more than
chatter. Today at noon. the man
on my right had a book propped
before him at which he. never
looked. The man on my left was
reading} the Reader’s Digest. The
nearest one who was eating was
three seats away. .

I realize that the University is
overcrowded and that’ it has a
notable lack of facilities for pure-
ly special activities, as well as
eating space. The 12th ﬂoor is too
far away and the Commons Room
is dark, has too few seats and the
No Smoking rule is in effect.
Therefore the tuckshops are -the,
logical places to meet friends, ‘or
even just sit.

. Yet I, wonder if this overcrowd-
ing might not be reduced, ‘if only
for a short while at noon. ‘An
appeal to the undergraduates to
show more consideration {is one
possible solution, though I fear
it i is one of dubious merit. An-.
other solution would be to have
disciplinary agents to keep the
occupants of the tables moving.
To many of us who would like to
lunch with a little more ease, it.
is obvious that there must be
-some 5 improvement.

Spectator Space
Editor, The Pitt. News,

We are always reading “The
Student Congress voted‘ yesterday
on such’ and such measures”; is

terested students to sit in on Con-
gress sessions and watch what is
going on? ‘If. thereare accommo-
dations for spectatorsghow much“
space is provided? Besides not
taking part in the proceedings
what other restrictions are there
for spectators? A

There are pros and cons against
lobbyism, but it still is a means
for a minority group to get some
voice in school govern-ment. I
think other students would be, in-
terested in having the opportunity
to speak to their representatives
before and after sessions. I am
one person who has no lobbying
interest -— at the moment‘ -— and
who would appreciate the oppor-
tunity, of watching Congress pro-
ceedings. ,

Carnegie Limits Students

: Use of Bound Periodicals

Debate Team Members:
Special Student Needs Are

1 Only Possible Exceptions

>~a.~

Undergraduate college students
will be restricted from using the
Carnegie library's bound period-
icals from now on. This restriction
was announced by Mr. Ralph

Munn, director of the library, in
a letter to all college and high
school heads in the city.

The library staff, according to
Mr. Munn, is aware of the im-

. portance of the’ assignments and

research work that prompts stu-
dents to use the reference period-
icals. Wear and tear, however,
haslbeen so great that an effort
must be made to preserve them.

Some of the ﬁles are irreplace-
able and with “great reluctance”
and remembering that they are
“custodians of community proper-
ty” the ofﬁcials take these steps
in order that these valuable ma-
terials may be preserved.

A few exceptions will be made.
Members of debating teams with
letters from their coaches and
students whose needs are consid-
ered exceptional by instructor and
have letters stating their needs,
signed by that instructor, will
have access to the ﬁles.

No work published prior to 1946
will be circulated but the‘ follow-

New Lockers Ordered

Lockers are- on order and will
be installed at Ellsworth around

Cap & Gown Renames Play
'Mabe|'s Fable.‘ Lists Cast

By Richard Kovar

Due to conﬂicting copyrights and the similarity of Cap and
Gown’s 1947 title “On Your Toes” to past Broadway musicals, the
forthcoming all-male production has been renamed ‘Mabel’s Fablef’
by the Graduate Cap and Gown club. The story, however, remains
the same, concerning the antics of a USO touring company that re-
turns ‘to Hollywood to make a picture.

“Mabel’s Fable” entered rehearsal Nov.. 10 with John Geary and

Tito Braun-stein in the male and
female leads. Braunstein portrays

singer, while Geary plays oppo-
site him as ‘Gary’ in the male
singing lead.

“George Washington” star Jack
In-grim plays MacAfee, manager
of the show troupe. ‘His Holly-
wood agent, ‘Wilson,’ is Jack Ab-
ramson, also an ex-Pitt Players
star.

Author Ken Phifer is the show’s
featured dancer, playing a straight
dramatic role, as does Bob Whit-
man in the female dramatic lead
as ‘Marilyn.’ Murray Harris por-
trays ‘Mrs. Rockwell,’ Bob Wiley
is the movie producer, ‘Dimitri,’
and Norman Rabinovitz plays
Russian’-imported director, ‘Le-
vinski.’ ~

‘Mabel,’ the hairy-legged Brook-

 

figet to the danceiaiven» i.n"th'eir....

‘Sherry,’,a Betty Hutton type’ of.

.the

lyn ch-o-rus girl, is played by Bob
Amon, while Alfred Goggini is
cast as ‘Van Doren,’ an eifemin-
ate professor. As the ‘Skipper,’
Jerry Newberg portrays an ‘old
salt’ from away back.

Supporting roles include James
Cooper as a drunk, Bob Dompka
as the steward, Jerry Lebovitz,
assistant director; Irving
Sandson, a waiter; Robert Brunk
and Michael Men-delsohn, camera-
men; and as ‘yes men,’ ' Albert
Hirsch, Jay Meyers, Charles Beat-
ty, and Donald Kerrntz. ‘ ‘

Director Harvey Pope has
drawn up an exacting schedule of
rehearsals that will keep this
year’s crop of Cap and Gowners
really stepping in order to h-ave

the fall issue of the Pitt Quarterly magazine, with a circulation of 7000,‘

‘would be ready for distribution by next week. .

The quarterly circulation includes copies sent to all the cul
tural centers in Europe at the_request of _the state department.

This 48 page publication will feature an article about the Lon- ‘

_two University faculty members,v* .

Dr. Klaus H. Hofmann, associate
research professor in. chemistry,
and Dr. A. E, Axelrod, senior re-
search fellow in .chemistry, pre-
sented papers on bio-chemistry.
These reports created quite a
stir among the delegates and re-
ceiv-ed favorable press comments
throughout Europe. Dr. Alexander’
Silverman, professor and head of
the department of ‘chemistry, was
another Pitt representative.
Another feature is the double
page spread given over to the
Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph’s pic-
tures of the various bridges in
the Pittsburgh area ranging from

policy of “constanstly discovering
and making people aware" of the
culture of western Pennsylvania.”

“Soo.ttie” Plan   of Attack Following  
Case Victory Disclosed by PCIC  

The following article deals with a little known group of men ate

the University. For security reasons their names will not be disclosed

at this time. They come under the

title of P.C.I.C. (Pitt Counter In-

telligence Corps). A small part of their operation will be revealed in

this story.

A terrible danger is”: now past.¢
The planned treacherous reprisal
by the lowly bag-pipers from
across the hollow is. history. Our
‘stately Cathedral is still the tall
straight shaft that we all love,
saved by a team of men from a
little college in Ohio. W-e thank
you brave and noble Case.

Tech versus Tech

On Saturday, Nov. 8, 1947, Case
Institute of Technology over-came
and defeated a football team
from Carnegie _Tech. Both Techs
wanted to win the game; it would
mark the ﬁrst victory of the sea-
son for the winner. Our former
doormat rival especially wanted
a win. They wanted to win for
one reason and for that one rea-
son they almost did. Again we
thank you brave and. noble Case.

Carnegie Tech had expected a
victory over little Case. An actu-al
pre-dawn Monday attack on the
University of Pittsburgh’ was to
follow the victory. This plan was
not a hastily drawn affair. The
mode of’ attack and its direct

 

strategy was complete in every
detai1.~Approxi-mately 35-00 Tech
students were to take part in it.
PCIC Gets Word

That such an infamous act was
in the making was not completely
a mystery to our P.C.I.C. agents.
Word thattsomethini-g was up had
come in through the underground.
“P-day, November 10” came the
message. That was all, but it was
enough. Friday night, the 7th of
November, our agents went into
action. Four men, whom, we shall
refer to as P, Q, R, and S, drifted
into the Techite’sl “University

‘Plenty of Aerials Expected

Tomorrow When Pass-Minded
Boilermakers Face Panthers

. by Max Scherb
Tomorrow’s ball game ,between Pitt’s Panthers and the Boiler-
makers from Purdue may well turn into a battle for aerial super-
iority. The Wheeling Whip, Paul Rickards, will match his gunnery
against Purdue’s Bob DeMoss, who led the Big Nine passers in yard-

age gained a year ago.

Two Bobs, DeMoss (left) and Heck (right) head the Boilermakers tomorrow. DeMoss’ passing coupled

with Heck’s strong defensive play rule Purdue a two touchdown favorite.

Mike Pans Pass Rumors

Any notions that Pitt is plan-
ning a heavy passing attack
against Purdue ere dismissed in
short, curt terms by Head Coach
Mike Milligan yesterday.

“No, we have no deﬁnite pass-
ing plans,” said Milligan. “We’ve
always passed a lot. We passed in
the ﬁrst quarter in several games.
We continue to pass in practice.
But we have no particular pass

offense in mind.” ,

Apparently the Panthers have
no intentions of playing the game
before it actually starts. If, in the
course of the game, passing is
needed, Milligan will employ it.

It was believed by some that
with Paul Rickards, the Wheeling
Whip, in the
starting lineup,
Milligan might
try to counter-
act the passing
of Purdue’s Bob
DeMoss with a
p r e a r ranged
aerial splurge
of his own.

“In our sys-
tem , we have

three passers,” Mike stated. Of-
course, it is no secret that Full-

back Rickards is no Bronko ,Na- -

gurski on a line plunge.

During the early part of the A

season, the coaches found it as
difﬁcult to instill ﬁghting spirit in
Rickards as waking up the. statue
th-at fronts Carnegie Library. But
eventually he came around.

The Minnesota game found him
in the starting lineup for the ﬁrst
time. He responded with a salvo
of well-aimed throws.

Turning from passing to a more
popular topic -—— the weather -
Mike said that the players drilled
hard in a drenching rain on Tues-
day. Should the Purdue ﬁeld be a
wet one, the Panthers will not be
totally unprepared.

Milligan would not, of course
make any predictions on tomor-

,row’s game. His only comment

was, f‘If it’s as cold out there as
it is here, I'll bring out the heavy
overcoat, the gloves, and the
warm wool scarf.”

5 Weather permitting, both team

will attempt to do most of their
gaining by air. Both are harbor-
ing the suspicion that the other
side is just a little weaker on pass
defense and one cah outscore the
other.

Despite the personal publicity
the two backs will receive, the
game will be won on the ground
in the ﬁght between the forward
walls. Milligan’s battered and
patched line will again butt its

collective head against a heavier V

opponent. '

Line Big and Deep

Head,Coach Stu Ho1comb’s line
averages 215 pounds from end to
end. He can call upon three play-
ers for every spot.

This is an extreme advantage
over the sickly Panthers who are
forced to start their third stringers
and will be outweighed by better
than twenty-ﬁve pounds per man.

Right tackle Pete Barbolak, six
feet, three inches and 225 pounds
of man from Riverside, Illinois,
has been singled out by Mid-
Western writers as the ‘outstand-
ing Purdue lineman. Week after
week his brilliant Cline play has
added to Purdue’s success.

Right Side Really lstrong
Abe Gribon and Norman Ma-

loney also deserve" mention for.

their part in making up the Boil-
ermaker’s strong right side. Grib-

on, a 226-pound guard, and Cap-I

tain Maloney at 195 pounds have
teamed with Barbolak to make a
powerful defensive combination.
. Bob Heck, left end,

Murray, guard, at 204, 210, and

227 respectively, comprise the left 

defensive wall. Angelo Carnaghi
at 190 pounds is the center and
lightweight of the frontline.
Clyde Grimenstein, a reserve
right end, comes in on the of-

fense to snag passes. The starting '

backﬁeld will~see DeMo-ss at quar-
terback, Adams and Szulborski
at the halves, and Milito at full.
Overconﬁdence Beat Them
Purdue dropped a 26-21 decision
to Minnesota last Saturday. The
Boilerrnarkers went off the ﬁeld
at halftime leading the Gophers

21-12. Overconﬁdence led to their.

defeat as Minnesota came back the

second half and pushed them all_

over the ﬁeld. ‘

It is hoped that Pitt will do the
same.

 

The Dean of Men’s oﬂice will
be well represented tomorrow at
the Purdue game. Every man on
Dean Biddle’s staﬁ is making the
journey by station wagon.
