The academic procession will be

marshaled by the student senate, who’

will act as escoit and lead the proces-
sion. The students will form \in line
at 10:45 o’clock under the marshal-

. ship of Dean J. C. Fetterman, of the

College. His assistants will be Dr. A.
B. Wallgren and L. J. Heath, of the
college. The marshals for the several
schools have been selected as follows:

bach.

After the students and faculty ﬁn-
ish the route of march, starting down
Grant Boulevard to Fifth ave. and the

surrounding streets they will then take I

their seats in the Soldiers Memorial

hall to hear the address of the morn— '

ing by Dr. Rossiter Worthington Ray-
mond, dean of mining engineers in
America.

Dr. Raymond was graduated from
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1856
and afterwards studied at_the Univer-
sities of Heidelberg, Munich, and the
Mining Academies of Frelberg. After

. his return he was granted the degrees

of Hon. Ph. D. at Lafayette, in 1869,
and L.L.D. at Lehigh, in 1906. After
having occupied the position of con--

four years, he was promoted to the po-

‘ sition of U. S. commissioner of min-
ing statistics, which he occupied until
1876, when duty called upon him to
devote most of his time to the editing
of journals on mining and engineering.
Among thenoted works of Dr. Ray-
mond can be found:’ “Die Leibgarde,”
“Brave Hearts,” “Camp and Cabin,”
“Glossary of Mining and Metallurgi-

NEW CONSTITUTION“
FAST TAKING SHAPE.

-Work one revising or re-making the
student constitution of government is
going on slowly in the Board of Con-
trol and the student committees.

At its meeting Wednesday evening,
the board continued the‘ standing of
the c o In mi t t e e on constitutional
amendment and this body was ordered
to draft an entirely new document and
submit it for consideration.

The class committees appointed by
the Junior, sophomores and Freshmen
met Tuesday and discussed the matter.

The dedication of a permanent home‘
for the Mellon Institute of .Industrial
Research marks an important point
in the history of American industry
and education. Wherever raw materials
are secured or wherever they are made
into goods to supply the many wants
of man, there are a whole host of
problems awaiting solution. These
may have to do either with perplexing
difﬁcsulties in manufacture, with the
utilization of wastes, with bettering
and cheapening the products manu-

‘factured or with the discovery of new

and useful products. To aid industrial-
ists to solve these problems by bring-
ing the wealth of contemporary’ science
to bear upon them, the Mellon Institute
was founded. It represents alliance
between industry and learning the
possibilities of which are without
limit. _

The alliance takes the form of what
is known as “The Industrial Fellow-
ship System.” In this system, an
individual or -a company contributes
to the Institute a deﬁnite sum- of
money, (usually for a period of two
years. This money is used by the
institute to pay the salary of the man
or men who work on a particular
problem, the solution of which is of
interest to the donating company. The
results obtained belong exclusively to
the company.

History.

The idea of this unique system of
the service of science to industry was
first thought out by Robert Kennedy
Duncan, the late Director of the Mel-
lon Institute, while attending the
International ‘Congress of Applied
Chemistry in Rome, in 1906. ‘

For some years previous to this
congress, Mr. Duncan had been in
Europe gathering material for two of
his books‘, .f‘The New Knowledge” and
“The Chemistry of Commerce.”

Through his visits into the work-

' shops, laboratories and universities of

some of the countries of Europe, and
through his talks with industrialists
and

pressed with the spirit of co-operation%

which existed between industry and
learning which made for the advance-
ment of both. At the same time he
became aware more than ever before
of the fact that much of American
industry, from the standpoint of
manufacturing efficiency was in a
lamentable condition. The absence of
the application of modern science was
one reason for this condition.

To remedy this -.it occurred to Dr.

Duncan to proposel an Industrial

Fellowship System. On returning
from Europe to accept the chair of
Industrial Chemistry in the University
of Kansas, he established there the
ﬁrst Industrial Fellowship in January,
1907. The scheme was presented to
the public by Dr. Duncan in an article
entitled “Temporary Industrial Fel-
lowships”’in the Northern American
Review for May, 1909, and a little

“The Chemistry of Commerce”
(Harper’s). .

In 1911, Dr. Duncan was called to
the University of Pittsburgh to in-
augurate the system in the Depart-
nient-. of Industrial Research.’ In
March, 1913, Messrs. Andrew William
Mellon and Richard Beatty Mellon,
citizens of Pittsburgh and sons of the
late Judge Thomas Mellon of the class
1837, at the University of Pittsburgh,
impressed by the evident practical
value of the system, both to industry
and to learning, established it on a
permanent basis through the gift of
over half a million dollars and‘. con-
sented to allow their family name to
be placed on the new building as the
“Mellon Institute of Industrial
Research and School of "Speciﬁc
Industries.” .

On February 18th, 1914, the Insti-
tute lost by death its founder and
Director, Dr. Robert Kennedy Duncan:
Dr. Duncan was succeeded by Dr.
Raymond Foss Bacon, who had been
Associate Director under Dr. Duncan.

The Working of the System.

When an industrialist assigns a
problem to the institute, Dr. Bacon,
the director, selects the best available
man who can be‘ found for the par-
ticular work. This man spends a few
weeks in the factory of the donor to
become acquainted with his problem
at ﬁrst-hand. In this way he gains a
knowledge of the manufacturing con-
-ditions which must be met if his re-
search work is to be successful. He
returns to the institute and examines
the literature of his subject in order
I to familiarize himself with What others
have done on his problem. He is
then assigned a laboratory and begins
what may be called the “test tube
scale” of experiment. When he is
satisﬁed that he has something. of
value to his donor, hebuilds at the
institute a small “unit plant.” If the
“unit plant” appears to have com-
mercial possibilties, his next step is
to install the pro_cess on a large scale
in the factory. This has been the

RISE OF DIRECTOR
R. F. BAGUN RAPID,

The late Robert Kennedy Duncan,
who initiated the system of industrial
fellowships, when being interviewd by
the editor of a magazine, about a
month before his death, on the work
ofthe Mellon Institute, said “A great
deal of credit for what we have ac-
complished belongs to Dr. Bacon, I
want you to be ..sure to mention him.”
A'short time after this, in making a
report to Science on the progresspof
the system at the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research, Dr. Duncan
wrote, among other things:

In the Spring of 1912, owing to ill
health, the result of too much re-
sponsibility, arrangements were made
to give me an associate director, Dr.
Raymond F. Bacon, who came to me
from the
Washington. Dr. Bacon’s scientiﬁc
prescience, his suggestive power in
research, together with his sym-
pathetic understanding of the tradi-
tions of the work and his personal
loyalty have made him an ideal
associate.”

THE 12_8th ANNIVERSARY.

 

Today the University is celebrating
its 128th birthday, and a happy anni-
The institution has

an academy, college and small Uni-
versity until its magniﬁcient buildings
loom up before us and we realize that

’_ we are gazing upon one of the great-

est institutions of . learning in the
country.
, This remarkable progress is the re-
sult of many creative agents which
have been cooperating to produce the
ﬁnal result which is a dream ever
haunting the mind of every Pittite.
The people in‘the Pittsburgh district
have awakened and are beginnig to
‘realize that the ideal location for a
‘University is right here in the smoky
city. Their cooperation is sure to
further the already phenomenal pro-
gress. -

The birhtday celebration is made
most aluspicious by the dedication to
humanity of the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research and School of
Speciﬁc I-ndustries. This remarkable
building, whose four walls will ‘see
many experiments in the interest of
science and industry in the -future,
has been made possible through the
kindness of Richard Beatty Mellon
and Andrew William Mellon who are
interested in every progress of the
University. _

We are proud to have the distingu-
ished visitors with us today who have
come from every educational center
to ‘view the work which furthers edu-
cation in the Pittsburgh district. It
is a cistinct pleasure and we feel sure
that they will realize the way that
the educational needs are being taken
care of.

The future will see bigger things for
Pitt. The work will go on by leaps
and bounds. The cooperation of the
citizens of the state is a vital neces-
sity but last and not least we the
students must assits in every way pos-
sible in building up a large and con-
scientious student body.

ARE WE SOCIALISTS? V

The reception of a letter a short
time ago from a member of the alumni
association canceling his membership
in the association anl withdrawing his

' subscription to the PITT WEEKLY,
because the picture of Bouck White
appeared in these columns, calls at-

, tention to the intolerance still exhibit-

ed by some individuals in spite of the
advanced state of our present day and
generation. ‘

' ', Such petty action but calls attention
-to" the narrow mindedness- which it

‘ in.

thought to {the attempt to -. provide i
the news, of any community whatever ’
4 would realize the necessity of a broad
.spirit of tolerance towards any and

all of the elements represented there-
To do so it is necessary to lay
aside all personal prejudices and
maintain a fair and equal attitude in
allotting the degree of prominence
extended to the various organizations.
In this way only can the "interests of
the general public be truly sub-served.‘
The same plan holds true with a
student paper which honestly seeks to

' serve the student body -as a whole.
‘Therefore, in declaring our policy on
.such matters, we hold no brief for

any propaganda, endeavoring to show

"friendship and equality towards all,

animosity to none and maintaining
above all else those principles which
will best serve the interests of those

for whom our services are enlisted.

And in return, we ask that our read-
ers maintain a like attitude toward
whatever may appear in these
columns. ’

LETTER BOX

Editor PITT WEEKLY:

Attention is being attracted by the
actions of the students who attend
the games and social functions at the
Gymnasium. When a student enters
a University building at such an oc-
casion, he should show enough re-
spect to remove his hat and to refrain
from smoking in the presence of visi-
tors, many of whom are ladies. It is
a shame that a student should become
so addicted to the weed that he can
not restrain himself for so short a
period. A STUDENT.

 

Pittsburgh, Pa., Feb. 14, 1915.

Editor PITT WEEKLY:

The PITT 'WEEKLY has been of
particular interest to me lately, be-
cause, having taken a part in student
government while a student, I am now
anxious to see the developments. I
have sometimes been surprised at the
discontent which has been manifested,
especially when that discontent was
aimed at the constitution- I believe
that it will be admitted that during
the year of 1912-13, the Board of
Control was fairly popular and was an
actual power in student affairs.
future success of student government
on the campus semed to be assured.
So it is not surprising that I am not in
accord with sentiment which would
revolutionize the system. I believe
that the system will work, for I have
seen it work, although I know that
some important changes are neces-
sary. ~ -

If the present aroused state of
student sentiment would crystallize
into a real interest in their govern-
ment and this interest could always
be maintained, in times of peace as
well, then the constitution would
develop and change as conditions re-
quired. One may wonder if student
government at Pitt is growing or

declining.
I think that beforediscarding the
present constitution, the students

should know more about the formation
of that instrument. I am not qualiﬁed
to tell this part of the story,vas I was
only a freshman when it happened.
But as I recall, in the spring of 1910,
a committee of three faculty and
seven students drew u the constitu-
tion of the Student Board of Control
of the University. It has been said
that the constitution was made to
provide for a particular occasion and
did not look to the future. Neverthe-
less, I maintain that this constitution
can be made to work as well for the
government of Pitt students today as
it did four years ago. Those who
know about the formation of the U.
S. Constitution say that it was made
for an emergency and that the mem-
bers of the convention never con-
templated that it would last for more
than a generation at most. Yet it
has lasted until today as the model of
all free governments, because a clever
political people were able to adapt‘ it
to the changing requirements of a
nation's growth. That the constitution
of the Student Board of Control would
in a smaller degree be capable of
adapting itself to the changing con-
ditions of student life,'was an idea
which the late Dr. Dyess, who had a
big part in making the ‘instrument,
expressed to me at various times.

In . accordance with this idea of
adaptation to changing conditions, the
Board of Control in 1912-13 amended’
the constitution in several important
ways. I fell qualiﬁed to speak of this
because I was there. We realized
that something was wrong with the
constitution and we set out to make it
right.

The reason for the ﬁrst big change
was that the Board of Control and the
Senate expired every June, remained
dead for several months, and could
only be revived during the Fall term
after much effort and loss of time. It
meant that when the senior members
of the Senate graduated, the organiz-
ation fell to pieces. Any government
to be a successlmtust be continuous.
In England, the Kink never dies. At
Pitt there should always be a living
form of student government. It should
go on without a break. To accomplish
this, Article .VI of the constitution
was amended -to read as follows:
“During the fourth week of May and
the second week of January of each
year an election shall take place with-
in the class organizations affected. At
the election during January, the fresh-
man, sophomore, junior and senior
classes shall each elect one representa-
tive and at the May election, the fresh-
man, sophomore and junior classes
each elect one representative. Each
representative shall serve for one year
or until his successor is elected unless
his term shall be terminated be dis-
missal or graduation from the Uni-
versity. Newly elected ‘senators take
their places at the meeting following
the election.” If this article was
strictly adhered to, it would mean that
after the May election, the. Senators
of the different schools would organize
for the coming year. After this elec-
tion there are only six senators in
each school, for the terms of the
senior ‘senators terminate with the May

election and they should not have a .-

part in organizing for- the next year.‘
It was intended that freshman, sopho-

THE CHARTER DAY BANQUET.

The news columns of THE WEEK-
LY contain ﬁnal announcements re-
garding the Charter Day banquet to-
night. Those in charge of the affair
have worked hard to make it a suc-
cess and a large attendance of alumni
and others is assured. The presence
of Judge Gary, Dr. Richards, and

quet unusually interesting.

From an alumni standpoint it should
have a beneﬁcial effect.
alumni gather together, a seed is
sown that some day bears fruit. Now
is the time when the graduates of
“W. U. P. and “Pitt” can be of great
service to their Alma Mater, more
than possibly at any time in our his-
tory. We are at that particular stage
of development when the support and
aid of alumni is needed in order to
insure further progress.

Members of the Alumni Association
are urged to talk up. the matter of
membership to every alumnus met at
the banquet to-night. "No organized
attempt will be made to secure mem-
bers. The work will be left to the
individuals. We don’t want the “stay
outs” to feel that we are"‘ramming
something down’ their throats,” but
we do want them to know that we
want them in the fold and that it is
there where they can do the most
good.

The banquet to-night is scheduled
for 6 p. m. and the hotel management
will start to serve not a minute later
than 6:15. It will be short, but snap-
y. C. W. Scovel, '83, the toastmaster,
will limit the speeches to 10 minutes.
With Dr. Walther Riddle’s talk on
“The Development of Chemistry at

of all the buildings in which chemistry
has been taught at our institution.
These include the old Northside build-
ing at the corner of Buena Vista and
North ave., the Ross st. building, the
Perrysville ave. building, Thaw hall,
and the Mellon Institute. Pictures of
prominent instructors in chemistry at
the University will also be thrown on
the screen. The speakers, in addition
to Dr. Riddle, are Dr. Raymond F.
Bacon, Dr. T. W. Richards, Judge E.
H. Gary, and the Chancellor S. B. Mc-
Cormick.

Many of. the alumni are coming to
the banquet with the intention of
later attending the‘ Mellon Institute
reception, or the Cap & Gown show at
the Schenley theater. The ‘banquet
will be over in time to admit of this
arrangement. — ‘

-THE BEAVER COUNTY CLU_B.

 

I The next “Pitt Club” will be formed
in Beaver county, the section that pro-
duced “Joe”. Thompson, “Polly" Gal-
vin, “Hube” Wagner and other athletic
celebrities. '

A dinner and organization meeting
is to be held. at the Tamaqua club,
Beaver Falls, Friday, March 5th, at
7 p. m., anda big turn out of Pitt
students and alumni in that county is
expected. An Organization Commit-
tee, composed of about 15 alumni and
students has been working hard for
the past week with the idea of_ outdo-
ing. the attendance at the Jefferson
and Westmoreland county gatherings.
A letter has been sent to all students
and alumni who live in the county,
urging them to attend.

The purpose of the club, as outlined
in this letter, is to “boost” the Uni-
versity at every opportunity—mem-
bers working to induce the best class
of high school graduates to attend our
institution and the importance of lib-
eral appropriations, etc. In addition

ganizers to arrange for club social
functions at regular, intervals, it be-’
ing felt that these affairs will do much
to bring the alumni and students in
closer relation with each other and
with the University.

The ladies of the Wesleylsociety of
the Methodist Episcopal church of
Beaver Falls will serve an elaborate
dinner.» The Tamaqua club is ideal for
such a meeting. The rate per plate is
$1.00.

If you are a Beaver countyite, come
out sure. See K. M. Gould, ’16, or
Paul G. Thompson, ’15, if you fail to
get a notice. We don’t want to miss a
single eligible. Ladies are invited.

LADIES,- YOU ARE WELCOME.

 

As the Alumni Association Consti-
tution and By-Laws have been con-
strued to contain nothing that will do-
bar women graduates of the Univer-
sity from members in that organiza-
tion, the General Secretary is going
to make a special effort to get the fair
sex interested. Being a co-ed insti-
ution there is no reason why the
women should not play an important
part in alumni activities just as they
are doing in undergraduate activities.
This is the case at Cornell and other
well ‘known co~educational universi-
ties,'one of the leading workers on the
“Cornellian Council,” the alumni body
of Cornell, being a woman.

A plan is now being devised to in-
terest all the woman graduates in the
affairs of the Asosciation. We want
them to get THE WEEKLY and keep
in close touch with Alma Mater.

PITTAGRAPHS.

Charles DeKubb.

O Gratitude, where hast thou flown
That such a state as this is here,
What prep school has such boldness

sown.
As in our freshmen doth appear?

Presumption it is

To ask such boons as freshmen do;

It makes you think, well now gee
whiz .

To tell my thoughts, words are too
few.

For when a freshman boldly says,
In speaking of the old Cap Night,
That he must have all privileges '
When caps are all put out of sight;

It_ makes you think, and thinking
smile,

Of that old proverb you all know;

“Give him an inch, he’ll take a mile,”

For that’s the spirit freshmen show.

If that’s the spirit they obey 
We’ll have to change their little tune;
We’ll have to take Cap Night away.
And put it near the end of June.

A VISITS; HETNZ PLANT

One of the largest and most en-
thusiastic bodies of Pitt students that
has ever assembled for a celebration
was that which gathered at .the Heinz
plant on last Monday to enjoy the
hospitality of that ﬁrm. _ _

The crowd gathered at the admini-
stration building of H. J. Heinz at
11 A. M. The first thing on the pro-
gram was the taking of a ph0’C0g1‘3’-Pb
of the entire body. This was followed
by a, luncheon in which the students
were introduced to a few of the .57.,
During’ the luncheon an entertaining}:
program was carried out. Singing by;
the Glee Club and the quartet, T9ad';_
ings by J. A. Thompson of the Cap 
Gown Club, singing by the Girls A
Chorus, and an address of thanks by;
Jerry" Black were the features.

Following the luncheon the students -;
illustrated 
lecture on pure food. . _ _ 

The body was then dlV1ded into;
groups of about 25 each, and each;
section placed in charge of a com-;
potent guide. The students were;
ushered through the plant and shown?
the different phases of the food pre-I
paration industry.

A

procedure in the case of some forty-3
four Fellowships which have come to‘
the institute since its establishment
at the University of Pittsburgh. In
1911.

The School of Speciﬁc Industries.

In connection with the Institute
there is being established what_is
known as a Graduate School _of Speciﬁc
Industries. This school is unique
in the history of education. It IS the
intention to admit to this school en-
thusiastic young chemistswho have
received a thorough training in the
fundamentals of the science andwwho
desire to make their life-work in a
certain industry. These young men,
by being in intimate contact and
associated with those who are devot-
ing their whole time to the problems
of a speciﬁc industry, will become
thoroughly familiar with the applica-
tion of chemistry to a particular
industry. Thus, for example, the man
who wishes to become an expert in
glass will work in the laboratory and
in the glass factory with those who
have for a long time been devoting
themselves to the problems of _the
glass industry and who are in the
forefront of that industry. The op-
portunities for service to man, for
advancing knowledge, and for material

chemistry which await young men who
have received such a training as this
School of Speciﬁc Industries will offer
are enormous.

The New Building.

The new building which is Doric in
style to conform with the others build-
ings on the University campus was
designed by Mr. J. H. Giesey. It is
ﬁve stories high and is built of granite
and brick.

» Over its doorway, in bronze, is this
description: “This building is dedicated
to the service of American Industry:
the goal being ideal industry, which
will give to all broader opportunities
for purposeful lives.” _

The building was designed primarily
as an industrial problem workshop,
and each of the ﬁve ﬂoors was laid
out to secure the greatest amount of
light, air and compactness. The base-
ment ﬂoor contains seven rooms, the
main storeroom, where the stock of
chemicals and apparatus is kept; the
electric furnace room, designed and
equipped for research work at high
temperatures; ,a heavy apparatus
room, a room equipped for low tem-
perature work; a machine shop and a
kitchen. .

On the ﬁrst, the main ﬂoor, are
located the general oﬁice, the director’s
suite, the ofﬁce of the editorial depart-
ment, the library, the office and
laboratory of the assistant directors,
the assembly hall, a special apparatus
room and a dark room laboratory. The
second and third ﬂoors each contain
ten large research laboratories‘ and
nine small ones; the fourth ﬂoor, which
is not ﬁnished,~will contain an identical
number of laboratories just as soon
as the growth of the institute war-
rants its completion.

There are two sizes of research
laboratories in the new building for
the use of the fellows of the institute;
twenty-four laboratories 20 ft 6 in.
by 20 ft. 6 in. and sixteen laboratories,
10 ft. 6 in. by 20 ft. 6 in., on the second
and third ﬂoors, having been finished,
equipped and assigned. All these
laboratories are equipped with tables
and hoods constructed of acid-proof
stone and with supplies of gas, water,
vacuum and compressed air.

The laboratories for special work
are conveniently located throughout
the building. The room known as the
special apparatus room, on the ﬁrst
floor, contains the physical and chem-
ical instruments of precision. In the

of reinforced concrete, supported on
reinforced concrete columns extending
down through the basement with
spread footings underneath the
columns, and so arranged that it does
not come in contact with any other
portion of the building construction,
is provided for exact work with deli-
cate, instruments, "such as physical
measurements.

The heavy apparatus room is in the
basement. It is equipped with sys-
tems of grinding and pulverizing
machinery and with ﬁlter presses,
having all provisions for chemical
operations on a large scale. The dark
room laboratory on the ﬁrst floor is
provided and equipped for work in-

research. Reference has been made
tothe room in the basement which is
equipped for low temperaturesvwork.
This room contains a refrigerating
machine having an. ice-making capacity
of 27 pounds an hour, and a cold stor-
age room, cork lined. ,, ,
The main storeroom, located in the
basement, is furnished with an instal-
lation of steel shelving having a total
shelf surface of 3,200 square feet;

VAT THE HOME OF THE 57

RISE or DIRECTOR
BACON METEORIC.

(Continued from Page 1)

Dr. Bacon was born in Muncie, Ind.,
in 1880. His graduate work was done
in De Pauw University, from which
he was graduated in 1899. For the
next four years he was a fellow in
chemistry at the University of Chicago
from which institution he received his
doctor’s degre in 1904. From-1905_to
1910, he-was chemist of the United
States Bureau of Science in the
Philippine Islands. In the Islands, he
was engaged in the study of medicinal
plants and essential oils. During 1910,
he was assistant chemist in the Bureau
of Chemistry at Washington.

' In September, 1911, Dr. Duncan in-
augurated the system of industrial
fellowships at the University of
Pittsburgh. One of the ﬁrst companies
to subscribe to a fellowship was a
large oil company, which wished to
ﬁnd uses for very crude pretroleum.
Dr. Duncan, as Vvas his custom, looked
about the country for the best avail-
able man to head this research——for
there were to be other men to assist
the senor fellow-—and selected Dr.
Bacon. Dr. Bacon, during the ﬁrst
year Oléjiihe fellowship, produced such
remark" le results, showed himself
such a leader of men, and possessor
of such tact and keeninsight, that Dr.
Duncan, in the spring of 1912, invited
him to become Associate Director of
the institute.

Dr. Bacon, as Director of the Insti-
tute, carries in his mind the import-
ant details of the development of some
twenty-three researches which run all
the way from the chemistry of bread
making to the utilization of leather
scrap. A typical day in Dr. Bacon’s
life is a very busy one. Perhaps he
must acquaint a new fellow with his
problem and give him a broad outlook
on research in general; talk with some
prospective donors of fellowships;
accompany through the laboratories
a scientist who may have come afar
to study the fellowship system at ﬁrst
hand; listen to reports from the
assistant directors on the successes or
failures of the experiments on twenty-
three different researches; spend little
time in his private laboratory to learn
from personal experience the difficul-
ties with which’his men contentd from
day to day; write a scientiﬁc article;

there is telephonic connection with
each ﬂoor of the building, and a dumb-
waiter, capable of lifting 50 pounds,
has been installed for distributing
small supplies. An automatic water-
still having a capacity of 5 gallons an
hour, is installed in the attic; six
distilled water fountains; supplied by
gravity from a 125 gallon storage
tank in the attic, are conveniently
located throughout the building, ﬁve
being in the corridors and one in the
general office. The corridors on the
secondvand third ﬂoors are 10 feet
wide and 161 feet long; on each’ cor-
ridor there are a telephone, medicine
chests, _ﬁre extinguishing apparatus,
and dumb-waiter openings.

The library, which occupies a large
room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor,” contains
2,000 carefully selected volumes on
chemistry and technology, besides
several thousand government publica-
tions and pamphlets. Among the
features of this liba.ry are a file of
reprints of the contributions of all the
fellows, a ﬁle of all patents of the
fellows and a trade catalogue ﬁle.
This last is an important department
of the library. At present more than
1,000 catalogues of 415 different ﬁrms
are on file.

The machine shop, which occupies
a room in the basement is an important
adjunct to industrial research. It now
is under. the charge of two skilled
mechanicians and is equipped to pro-
duce the various special mechanical
appliances likely to be required in the
conduct of original investigations.

The assembly hall, located on the
first "ﬂoor, occupies a space 34 ft. by
51 ft. It is provided with a movable
lecture table and_ a lantern with
cinematograph attachment is installed
in the mezzaminei floor on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor corridor adjacent to the hall. The
assembly hall is to be used for semi-
nar work and stalf meetings and as
the lecture room of the School of
Speciﬁc Industries.‘ Its walls “are
decorated with ‘the’ photographs of
eminent chemists nd with penants of
the various’ universities represented on

NEW DRAMA SOCIETY
PUBLISHES   BREED

The new dramatic society, the Pitt
Players, which was. férmed last Week
is progressing in its ﬁnal organiza-
tionand deﬁnite plans for work are

Being a Confession -of Faith and In-
vitation to Practical Work.

We believe:

That the modern drama can be made
a mighty quickening force for intel-

That the multiplying evidences of
a new dramatic spirit in America in-
dicate that the art of_ the stage is on

hands of those who have too long
been permitted to protitute it to
meaningless or ignoble ends;

That, following the example of many
sister institutions, it is the University
of Pittsburgh’s duty and privilege to
have a share in the new work, and,
ﬁnally; we believe in the ability and
enthusiasm of our students and in the
power of our ideal to realize itself.
We propose: ’

The organization of an undergradu-
ate dramatic association for the pro-
duction of -modern plays and the en-
couragement of original dramatic
effort: »

That it shall be separate and dis-
tinct from all student organizations
now existing, but ready to cooperate
with them in every possible way;

That it shall not compete with,
overlap or duplicate their efforts;

That it shall not solicit support
from funds of the university corpora-
tion or student body, nor endanger
the advertising ﬁelds or patronage of
existing organizations;

That it shall offer no credits, prizes
or rewards, and that those who join

lieve in it and have a mind to work.

the industrial fellowship system an
integral factor in America’s educa-
tional and industrial system have been
thought out on the golf links.‘ Dr.

  AGAINST MILITARISM

Last Friday night at 8 o’clock, in the
Carnegie Lecture Hall, the student
bodies of Pitt and Tech joined with
the students of Columbia and other
large eastern universities to voice
their opinion and protest against the
spirit of militarism which is pervad-
ing the civilized world and is at pres-
ent threatening to make an armed
nation of the United States.

Five of the best speakers in this
section of the country delivered ad-
dresses on some phase of the Peace
Movement. They were Rabbi J.
Leonard Levy of the Rodof Shalom
Temple, J. M. Mecklen, Profesor of
Philosogy at the University of Pitts-
burgh, Chancellor S. B. McCormick,
G. C. Achison, President of the
Pennsylvania College for Women,
Allan H. Willet, Professor of
Economics at Technology. Professor
Frank T. Day of Tech acted as Chair-
man.

A resolution expressing the adverse
sentiment of the two student bodies
with reference to increasing our arm-
aments and fostering the spirit of
militarism in general was adopted.

The committees of the two schools
who had arranged for the meeting felt
that it was up to the students of
America to combat this reversion to
the primative brutal instincts. which
are characterizing the action of the
civilized nations at the present time,
and took great pains to select speakers
who had been in touch with the Peace
Movement for years. '

The student body turned out in full
force to witness the combat of “War
against War,” and after the bullets
were ﬁred by the competent speakers,
“Peace” was the ring in the heart of
every Pitt man.

more and junior members should
organize as soon as possible after the
May election and elect new chairmen.
These chairmen should then organize
the Board of Control and these new
oﬁicers should assume control at once.
The retiring members might be looked
to for advice. Seniors are busy at
this time of the year and they neglect
all student concerns. Therefore it is
imperative that the new organization
should become effective for a week
or two before school clc ‘es and thus
be able to take charge Jf things, to
plan for the next year, and be on the
job the ﬁrst day of the Fall term to
receive new students and assume all
the duties of their ofﬁces. I‘ care not‘
what plan of student government is
adopted, if it does not provide. the
element of continuity, it cannot suc-
ceed. Let me suggest that the present
Board of , Control, according to the
method provided in Article VII of the
constitution, should adopt an amend-
ment to Article VI to the effect that-
meetings of the senates of the schools
concerned and of the Board of Control
shall be called for the purpose of
organizing for the next year within
two or three days after the May
elections are over, and if the retiring
chairmen of these organizations 1‘ ail
to call such tneetings, it shall be in-
cumbent» upon the newly elected
members to organize without such
call. Perhaps it would be wise to
make an express provision that the
officers of the Board of Control and
the Senates shall be ‘automatically re-
tired after the May election and that
new ofﬁcers shall take their places.
It maybe necessary to do many things
before the desired result is obtained,
but it will be worth much effort if a
permanent student government results.
But student government, no matter
how perfect the system, should be by
the students. The Board of Control
and the Senate are the representatives
of the students. Their function is to
carry out the well—founded wishes of
the students. If they are wise, they
will not try to carry out their own
whims, but be willing to yield to the
demands of the student body. To make
our system of student government
responsive to the will of the student
body, I suggest that some provisions
in the nature of the initiative and the
referendum be added to the constitu-
tion. These provisions will never work
unless backed by an active student
interest and therefore should be care-
fully considered before they are
adopted. For instance, a referendum
such as this might be considered, “If
a certain percentage, say 20 per cent.
of the student body should sign a
petition asking for a student vote
upon some ruling or action of the
Board of Control and this petition be
presented to the Board of Control,
they shall call a meeting of the
student body at once, and in case of
their failure to act, the Chancellor
shall call such a meeting, at which

upon the question, and the result of
the vote shall be binding on the Board
of Control.” This referendum could
be used by the students in each school
upon actions of their Senates in
matters which concern onl one school.
In case the Board of Cont l or Senate
would not act upon some matter which
the students demanded, a similar
petition might be made, calling for a
vote on the question. This wouldbe
the student initiative. There should
be some arrangement also by which
officers who have failed to perform
their duties might be ousted either by
an impeachment by the Board of
Control of a Committee of the Senate,
or by some proceedings similar to re-
call.
require a larger percentage of signers,
than the initiative or referendum, so
that a good man may not be ousted,
in a moment of unpopularity. These
remedies ‘ are fundamental in all
democratic government and a body of
college students should be able to use
them to the best advantage.

Games may come, and games may
go; but the real hit of the 1,915 basket-
ball season was pulled last Saturday
nightby the. second team of thevWest-
inghouse Club, slightly aided and
abetted by the Pitt Freshmen.

 The ~ expression “second”? team is
used advisedly. Certainly there is no-

Following this superb exhibition, an
anticlimactic effect was produced by
the contest between the Westinghouse
ﬁrst team and" the Pitt Varsity.. Both
-ﬁves were imbued with the deplor-
able modern eager news for victory,
being altogethﬁ lacking in the ﬁner
sensibilities. As a result, this game
was much faster -thansthe preceding
one, and won more applause from the
groundlings. The particular favorites
of the crowd was Graham, for Pitt,
and Blasser and Markley, for West-
inghouse. Pitt was again victorious,
this time by a score of 38 to 30. _

‘Charles Reinecke entered 15 men in
the different events. ,Most of these
men were new at the game, and this
meet afforded the éoach an opportuni-
ty to see what the _new men were'

ecke done. his work that the winners
were forced to the limit to win. The
bouts were almost without exception
closely contested. So close were some
of them that the decisions of the
referee were questioned by many, of
the ‘spectators. Y
~-Francis and Barrett wereyentered
from the University in the 108-pound
' class. John Smoke/threw Francis in‘
4 minutes and 15 ‘seconds, and Barrett
was nailed, to. the mat on a cross bar

division. -.In the 125-pound class Pitt
fared better. -Ian Forbes threw Smith
in 4 Lminutes. and 30 seconds and‘ in
the semi-ﬁnals, earned. the decision
over Benninghoff. In this match he
tore several ligaments in his shoulder
and lost the ﬁnal contest to Kling-
shaw. Forbes secured second place
in, this weight. Foster, after securing
a good ‘hold on his man lost it when
the referee sent them back to the mat
and failed to give the Pitt man his
hold. Benninghoff got a scissors on
him and won out in the last few sec-
onds. , y ‘ ' _ ’
' W. Reilly and Riehl both.won their‘
matches in the prelmins of the 135
class. The semi-ﬁnals saw Reilly win
from A. B. Gantos and‘ Riehl lose to,
Jenkins on a half-nelson and a.scis-
sors. The ﬁnal between Reilly and
Jenkins was one of the most ‘excit-
ing bouts .witnessed.. "It was ._a_ no-

DEPARTMENT HONOREl]

Prof. Alexander Silverman, Director‘

of the Department of Chemistry de-
livered a series of lectures on glass
before a meeting of the American
Ceramic Society at Detroit, ‘Michigan,
during the past week.

Director Silverman, who for a great
many years has taken an active part
in the conducting of investigations of
glass processes has amassed valuable
information along this particular line,
an has prepared a lecture with this
knowledge as a working basis, which
has proven to be of immense practical
value, both to the chemist and the
manufacturer. Professor Silverman
delivered this lecture on February
18th, before the Detroit Section of the
American Chemical Society, and the
next evening gave the same lecture
before the “Chemical Engineering

' Society” of the University of Michigan.

‘ Mr. Silverman’ was highly pleased
at the’ warm reception tendered him
during his stay in Detroit. At the
beginning of the week he was the
guest of Dr. Edward Orton,vJr., Dean
of Enginering at Ohio State University
at a luncheon given for Director Camp-
bell of the University of Michigan.
Among others present were President
Parmalee of the American Geramic
Society, Dr. A. V. Bleininger of the
United. States Bureau of Standards.
On Wednesday evening he was the
dinner guest of Jesse E. McBride, Pitt

"02,- an engineering specialist in Con-

veying Machinery. He also visited
Ralph M. Perry, '04, the manager of
the Perry Testing Laboratory, for-
merly owned by the Michigan Central
Railroad. Mr. Perry conducts the
highest type of experiments at this
plant, among them being the testing
of all the material used for the con-
struction of the New Michigan Central
Depot at Detroit.

On Thursday the Ceramists visited
the George H. Clippert Brick Works,
Dodge Motor Car Works, Parke Davis
& Company Laboratories, Caulkin’s
Pottery and Hoskin’s Electric Furnace
Plant. After his lecture on Thursday
he was entertained by Chairman Con-
nor, Dr. Henderson and other members
at the Handcrafts’ Club.

Large and enthusiastic .audiences
greeted the Director at both the

hursday and Friday lectures. While
at the University of Michigan, Prof.
Silverman was the guest of Prof. A.
H. White, the head of Industrial
Chemistry. Friday evening Professors
White, Randall, Laird, Lichty and
Bottell entertained Prof. Silverman at
dinner at the Michigan Union. Later
Mr. Shaw, Alumni Secretary of the
University, conducted Profesor Silver-
man through the Alumni Memorial
Hall, a magniﬁcent building.

While in Detroit, Director Silverman
received an invitation to deliver a
lecture on Glass at Alfred University,
one of the oldest Ceramics ‘Schools in
the United States, and on his return
found an invitation to ‘deliver it at
Cornell Universityalso.  -

ADVANTAGE OF
‘ INDUSTRIAL SERVICE.

By Prof. A. N. Lucian.

(Continued from Issue of Feb. 12.) 

5. Two points touching welfare of
American society in general must be’
emphasized in passing.

a. The social advantage that this
work brings to the community.‘ I
will quote the words of Prof. Roe
here: “The only American, whom
many a Pole or Italian meets, are the
saloonkeeper, the ward-heeler, and
the grafter. Contact with clean-cut,
wholesome, educated boys opens up to

him a type of Americanism which he

sees in no other way.

b. The Industrial Service Move-
ment hasa direct bearing on the great
questions of social re-adjustment be-
tween Labor and Capital that must
be continually coming up as —a result
of modern industrial developments
and. changes of social ‘standards.
Legislative action, compulsory meth-
ods, involuntary submissions, must
always result in dissatisfaction, and
consequent disastrous clashes between
the two rival classes, unless we have
the men of education who stand be-
tween Capital and Labor, underneath
both, sympathize with both, have the
conﬁdence of both and are able to
make a deal with both with equal
fairness and goodwill. Thus. the
college man has a great .role as in-
terpreter of modern social evolution.

6._ The students of the University
of Pittsburgh can serve the institution
in no better way than by carrying her
inﬂuence into the various strata of
the complex society of Pittsburgh,
through their activity along the lines
fust outlined. In ‘this way they will
et the community of Pittsburgh
know the University, not only a.s a
training camp where victorious teams
are prepared to battle with the war-
riors of W. & J. and Penn State, but
also as a social and educational West
Point where we train leaders of men
who have a_t heart the development
and the social welfare of all classes
of people in the city of Pittsburgh.
There is no better way of winning the
sympathy, the cooperation and the
conﬁdence ‘of the great industrial
firms of Pittsburgh than by showing
them what the students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh can do and are
willing to do_ to make more efficient
and more faithful workmen of the
skilled and unskilled labor under their
command. Our inspection trips might
be made much morepleasant and use-
ful_ and will result in_ better relation-
ship between the University and the
manufacturer through the agency of
this potent social factor.

7. It must be emphasized here that
the work should be entirely voluntary,
with no expectation on the part of
the student of material recompense.
Instances have been known where
student volunteer workers were offer-
ed remuneration bybrganizations and
ﬁrms in a spirit of perfect fairness;
but it is needless to say that a kind
refusal has alwas been the immediate
reply and has invariably ‘won the

ing; W. H. K. McDiarmid, as Mr.
Clarkson, the American consul, who
is very realistic in his impersona-
tions; L. Preiss, as Vera, and Ian
Forbes as Florence, two graceful
movie actresses.

A feature of the show will be a
specialty by J. R. Darragh, Ec. ’18,
and J. M. Mullen, Dent. "17. This
clever pair present an exhibition of
modern dancing that would be a cred-
it to Castle House. Mullen will be
remembered as the. man who imper-
sonated “Miss. Ethel Hamilton of New
York” at the Junior Prom.

The chorus will also be. a-_big at-
traction this year. The singing and
dancing is excellent and the “team-
work” is perfect. The members of the
chorus are: J. S. Gray, G. T. Morrow.
J. R. Darragh, R. W. Walters, W. T.
Canan, R. F. Fox, G.‘F. Gurley, H. J.
Ryan, G. S. Lacock, N. McLeod, J. H.
Sorg, H. A. Leathers, S. E. Arm-
strong, G. H. Graham, J. M. Mullen
and C. G. Phifer.

Mention must be made of the un-
tiring efforts of the ones who. have
so ably guided the club in its work.
Dr. F. D. Tyler has worked unceasing-
ly to devolp the ability of the dancers.
Mrs. H. B. Mellor has designed the
costumes. Dean H. B. Meller, Dr. J.
S. Ashbrook, Miss Canﬁeld, Professor
and Mrs. H. R. Knifiien and Professor
and Mrs. H. C. Ray have all contri-
buted bountifully of their time and
patience. The officers of ‘the club,
S. B. McCormick, Jr., president; W.
J. Moreland, manager and Thurlow
W. Brand, secretary, have all given
much time and labor to make the club
a success.

Of the many ﬁne musical numbers

the acts and after each performance.
Those published are “That Syncopa-
tion Rag,” “The Lad in the Uniform,”
“I Want Someone To Love Me,” and
“Your The Girl For Me.”

conﬁdence and admiration of . the
offering party. To the student it is
most essential that he_ should carry
on the work along entirely altruistic
lines, in order that he may derive
from ,_ it the maximum amount of
training and self-development as well
as moral strength and stamina.

8. But I must not forget one great
phase of this problem which seems to
be entirely neglected so far as I am
aware-the extension of the work
among women. What has been said

about industrial service work by the _

men students of the University among
the working class of men applies with
equal and perhaps_ greater emphasis
to the. work that might be and indeed
should be started by the women of
the University in their respective
field. The woman, whether she be the
illiterate immigrant or the ignorant,
futureless shop and store employe, has
a greater claim for help and educa-
tion and social uplift than the man of
her age and position. All social de-
velopment starts primarily. from the
home and the working girl as_ the
future home-‘maker needs relatively
more attention and consideration from
her sisters in the University than the
workiiigmen expects from his breth-
And this is true
especially for the foreign born and
immigrant women who ﬂock  our
stores to build happy homes in our
peaceful land. If we want to elevate
the foreigners and ,make- them_ the
coming Americans, we must ﬁrst of
all educate and teach the immigrant
woman to lay a foundation of useful
American’ citizenship in the coming
American family. This is an unex-
plored field, as far as I know and at
ﬁrst serious obstacles will be en-
countered, but I venture to state that
when once the ﬁeld is broken and the
seed sown, the harvest will be even
more glorious than what we have

seen to be in the other department of h

the Industrial Service work. It is up
to the Y. M. C. A. now to do the
pioneer’s work in this ﬁeld and‘put
the name of the University of Pitts-
burgh at ‘the head of the roll of
honor. ‘

This is not a call to arms, hence I
shall not take space to ‘add any inter-
jections and cxhortations. I have
given a very incomplete summary of
the work as I happen to know it. I
understand that the University Y. 
C. A. already has a committee in
charge of Industrial Service work and
that there are some workefs in the
ﬁeld. I‘’ wish here to point out the
need of more volunteers in this great
field in the city of Pittsburgh and 
urge the men and women of the-Uni-
versity to realize the wonderful op-
portunity before them and prove equal
to the task of getting the most ‘out
of it by putting their-best effort into
it. Useful and efﬁcient service should
be‘ the goal of every educated person;
and to this goal the Industrial Service
work forms one of the most permanent

. elected March 15th.

and fundamental stepping stones.

RSTEPHEIN ‘rmw WRITES, T ‘ 
I I : or WAR SITUATION.

 

Stephen D. Thaw, .of the School of
Astronomy, son of. Benjamin Thaw,
has expressed himself in regard to
the .war situation, in an interesting
letter to the Chancellor. Mr. Thaw
was in Europe when the ‘war broke
out and has not yet returned. The
letter . was written from Zurich,
Switzerland, dated January 13th. We
quote .the letter:

“First: Strategically. The Germans
have gotten so far into Russia that
they cannot advance without endanger-
ing both wings. Hitherto the north

wing has been protected by the region '

of small lakes in which Von Dinden--
burg ﬁrst defeated the Russians, but
they have now passed that and before
they go further must bring up troops
to strengthen that wing. Query:
Have they the necessary troops? The
south wing is also in danger; from the
Russian Army which is now north of
Przemysl. True, if that army be
moved it would enable the garrison
of P. to come out but the Russians
have enough troops to strengthen that
army to a greater extent than the
(Austrians) Germans can theirs. Be-
sides, the former are likel to be joined
soon by the Romanians.

“In "the East: The Russian advance
in the .Caucasus is sure and their
junction with the British coming up
the Tigris-Euphrates from the gulf
is not far distant. The Turks may be
thankful for the Arabian desert,
otherwise thousands of troops from
India would be occupying Jerusalem
and attacking the rear of the army
which is moving on Egypt.‘This latter
movement is certain of failure in any
case. I doubt very much if the Turks
will ever reach the canal; much less
pass it. I

“In the Balkans: It is reported, on
good authority, that there is not a

‘single Austrian in Servia (except as

a prisoner) that the Servians are
ready to cross the Danube and that
the Montenegrins are advancing along
the Adriatic. They are delayed by
one lone Austrian battleship which,
anchored in the Gulf .of Cattaro, can
bombard their lines of communication
which are very near the shore!
it has been doing it.

“In the West: There is a rumor—— I

which seems to contain the germs of
truth—that the Allies are not trying

. to force back the Germans to their

own frontier, much less to the Rhine
o;;'- 1-eyond it—yet. For two reasons:
(1) The frontier is so strongly forti-
ﬁed-—as is also the Rhine—that it or
the Rhine, at present they could stop
present Anglo-French forces by a
much smaller number of men than is
necessary to hold the present line and

that, therefore, were they (the Ger- "

mans) driven back to the frontier or
the Rhine, at present. They could stop
the allied advance there and yet have
free another half-million or so to use
against Russia. (2) The allies are
baiting for the summer—not so much
for reasons of weather as for the
fresh Half-Million. (2) English
Canadians, etc., which will be ready
then, and with the aid of which (plus
the expected Russian advance from
the East) they‘ expect to drive the
Germans not only to the frontier, not
only to the Rhine, but into central
Germany. And these men they would
have to bait for even if they did not
wish to’ keep that extra half-million
from annoying the Czar.

“Second: Economically. Austria is
in dire straits and Germany herself is
feeling the pinch. She is a long Way
from defeat yet, but the Kaiser is
eating potato bread—to encourage his
subjects to do so! That seems a sig-
niﬁcant fact to me.

“Third: Diplomatically and Politic-
ally. Everyone seems sure that
Roumanians and Italian intervention
is only a matter of weeks; perhaps of
days. Russia wants Transylvania as
Italy wants the Frentino, and they
are both beginning to realize (1) that

the German combination cannot win

(2)that, if they expect the Allies to
grant their claims, they must pay for
it! The attitude of the Pope is widely
commented on in almost the entire
press, and more attention is being paid
to the Cardinal Mercier incident (which
seems a German blunder second only
to theinvasion of Belgium) and to the
position of the Vatican in case of
Italian belligerency, than his overtures
for peace or exchange of non-combat-
ants. It seems very likely at present

however that Benedict XV is going to _

be a more potent force when the
books are balanced than either Wilson
or Wilhelmina. I should not be sur-
prised if many things will be left to
him to decide which, under less terrible

conditions, would in themselves, be
the cause of war or of the continua-

tioneof war.

“Lastly: the Prospects of Peace are,
at present very, very dim and distant.
The Allies will not make peace so
long ‘as a single German remains on
allied soil. Germany will not make
peace so long as she sees anything
to be gained by further resistance——
and that’, I am sure will be long after
everyone else has given up every idea
that she has anything to gain thereby.

SENIOR RINGS
- TO BE CHOSEN.

7 At a meeting of the senior ring

committee last Wednesday evening,
four competing ﬁrms displayed designs
and quoted prices. The prices were
almost the same, and thepselection will
be made on the basis of reputation of
the ﬁrm, designs, and quality of work-
manship. Some of the members of
the committee expressed themselves
as being in favor of patronizing a
Pittsburgh ﬁrm.

After due consideration the com-
mittee voted with the result that two
of the ﬁrms were eliminated. It was
decided to ask the other-two ﬁrms to
submit sample rings before the com-
mitte would take any further action.

The designs submitted were original
and artistic. The majority of the
members seemed to favor a design
which was made up of a University
seal supported by two panthers.

President M. J. Baldwin announced
yesterday that he would name the
general commencement committee in a
few days. Each member of the
general committee will act as chair-
man of a sub-committee.
