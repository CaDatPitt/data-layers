Repression

Hoffman Seaks

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

(Note: See page nine for further
coverage.)

A mass of more than a thou-
sand students and observors
crowded into CF 120-1. filling
aisles and doorwa_ys last Satur-
day night. to hear a Black Pan-
ther leader and one of the Chicago
Conspiracy 7 denounce the es-
tablishment "and the silent ma-
jority that weans it."

Tied by the general theme of
Repression, the two spokesman.
Reggie Schell of the defense arm
of the militant black group and
Abbie Hoffman. were prefaced by
Dr. David Owens. a professor at
the University.

Lambasting the "repressive ra-
cist structure in this country."
Owens accused the silent major-
ity of "striking a blow on anyone
who speaks for change.

His comment that the silent
majority is “the lowest scum on
the earth" drew applause from his
youthful audience.

To liberate yourself. he contin-
ued. one must give himself up to
the cause 24 hours a day. Owens
Suggested organizing pockets of
resistance or. if not. "going into
the mountains to survive."

Like Hitler

Like Owens. Reggie Schell of
the Black Panthers talked about
the threat of “a police state."
drawing an analogy to the Hitler

   

regime of the 1940's. Since black

j. 9 ;

people are not getting "political
consequence" for the injustices
of the society. he believed their
only alternative is "military pow-
er. V

Schell objected to the misinfor-
mation that the people are fed
about the Black Panther Party.
“The news media projects the
Panthers to be people who are al-
ways talking about guns and kill-
ing. but the power and the weap-
ons are entrusted to the govern-
ment. Arm yourself or harm your-
self." he said.

'l‘here’s not much time before
you end up in concentration
camps. the Panther warned.

Convocation

Students, Faculty to Rap

by BOB GING
Staff Writer
An added catalyst to student-faculty rela-
tions is being presented at the University on
Wednesday, Dec. 21, starting at 1 p.m. and go-
ing all day in the Common Facilities Building.

The Convocation, as this program is called, is

an offspring of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences Cabinet, and is aimed at promoting good
will between students and faculty, and provid-
ing both groups with a vehicle for communica-
tion, according to Scott Baum, SG president.

Baum gave several reasons for the Convo-
cation being held on a regular school day. By
canceling classes in the afternoon, he hopes
that most of the students, being on campus any-
way, will take advantage of the opportunities
which the Convocation will provide. He said
that students will be informed of the workings
and direction of the committee and organiza-
tions which are directly responsible for the
content, regulations and changes in the College
of Liberal Arts. '

Although an agenda featuring speakers,
seminars and a theatrical presentation has
been composed, Baum stated that their was a
great flexibility to the program, and that in

In CF’

"crossing state lines with intent
to start a riot.” charged that the
“trial is legislating against a state
of mind."

While tin cans clinked with the
contributions of the listeners.
Hoffman concluded that “we have
to de-legitimatize the court as an
institution. “to show no respect
for its authority."

Love and Survival

Although Hoffman insisted that
he believes "in a nation based on
love." people must learn how to
survive now. “Young people must
get their politics into the street
where political decisions are
made in this country." he contin-
ued.

"Were in there to win.‘ des-
pite. said Hoffman. the impartial-
ity of judge "Julius the Just."
"who considers himself part of a
government team.“

Judge Hoffman. revealed the
speaker. has not passed an ac-
quital judgment in the past four
years. He cited the sentencing of
Bobby Seale to four years in pris-
on. 16 terms of three months. for
contempt of court after the Pan-
ther leader was silenced with gags
and chains as an example of the
Judges “fasish." '

terms of all that can be done, this agenda
“scanty.” He hopes that people will come
the convocation bringing ideas and “cra:
things,” relating to a liberal education at tl
University. He feels that the wide spectrum 4
speakers and listeners presented at the Cox

1 vocation will provide students and faculty wit

many opportunities to express these ideas.

One of the things that Baum hoped wouf
come out of the Convocation is a greater e.
posure of the Arts and Sciences Review Cor
mittee, and the work that this group has do:
in the way of curriculum reform. Other topiz
to be discussed at the convocation are the abc
ition of the foreign language requirement, tl
direction to today’s‘system of education at
credit for out of classroom learning expel
ences.

(Editor's Note: One of the main itemsof intere
to the University community during Wednesday's Co
vocation will be the report issued by the College
Arts. and Sciences Review Committee.

(As a service for our readers, The Pitt News hc
printed the entire report in a special supplement o
pages five, six, and seven. We hope you will read
and discuss it and other issues during Wednesday‘ ,
Convocation.)

MEMORIAL SERVICES for the late Rev. Martin Luther King were held II
Hein_z Chapel last Thursday as part of a growing movement to make Jan

‘ I5, King's birthday, a national holiday.
The services, which began at I I a.m., marked what would have bee

King's 4ist birthday. The singing of folk songs comprised the first part c
the 90 minute program.

A replaying of Dr. King's famous “I Have a Dream" speech, deliverei
in Washington, D. C., in I963, and the reading of a statement of com
plicity followed. Personal reflections were also given by Rev. Frank Horton

At this point. he concluded.
"Revolution in America is the
only authentic way to live."

Reportedly. nation wide dem-
onstrations of support for the con-
spiracy are planned for Feb. 20-21.

_and Rev. James E. Ray of the University and City Ministries (UACM), am

by Charles Carlson of the Lutheran University Student Center.

A" litany for Dr. King, read jointly by Rev. Horton and the congrega
tion and the singing of “We Shall Overcome” concluded the program.

All University classes were canceled for the day, yet attendance at the
services never rose to more than 60 persons.

Mike Fabricant

by jerry gruebel
associate editor

, - According to START Represen-

tative Michael Fabricant. Stu-
dents Towards Restructuring Ac-

tion Today promises to restruc—.

ture Student Government in an at-
tempt to make it a more viable or-
ganization in student affairs. The
‘START formula is the abolish-
ment of the Student Government
Senate and the establishment of a
Commission to write a new SG
Constitution.

START hopes to involve the stu-
dent body in a restructuring of Stu-
dent Government. Fabricant told
The Pitt News that the Commis-
sion will be named tomorrow

, which will be comprised of a broad
spectrum of the University.

“These are people that perhaps
would not normally have been in-
volved." explained Fabricant.
“They are"all committed to Stu-
dent Government. given a viable
vehicle for restructuring.“

According to Fabricant, the
Commission will be made up of
sophomores and juniors, and a

. few seniors who are committed to

remaining at the University an-
other year.

The Commission will hold a
seriesof open meetings in which
students can offer suggestions
concerning the restructuring of

 . Student Government. “If you in-

volve only five per cent of the stu-
dent body that normally would not
have been involved.“ explained
Fabricant. "then you have done
something."

Among the ideas filtering
‘through START to be suggested
to the Commission is student par-
ticipation on councils presently
active without students.

“No one has spoken about the
problems of seating students on
councils, such as the budgetary
councils, and the councils plan-
ning future expansion of the Uni-

' versity,” said Fabricant. “Here

too, the power lies. And the stu-
dents are not represented.”

A few START members would
suggest the Commission create a

‘council of various student organ-
’ _' izations “through which one or-
I ganization preparing for a parti-

cular kind of action can go for re-
sources and ask other organiza-
tions to apply uniform pressure."
according to Fabricant.

START envisions the coopera-
_tion of organizations within the
University. The intentions are for
the various student organizations
to pool their resources. including
people, time. and information.

Fabricant hopes that the Com-

" - mission will consider the feasibil-
ity of coordinating the efforts of

the proposed council with those of
other colleges and universities.
According to the START represen-
tative there are paralleling coun-
cils in other colleges.

“Another proposal which has
not been brought up in the elec-

tions up to now.“ said Fabricant.
"is that we must begin to look for
student pressure groups outside

of already known student organiz-

ations. The seeds have already

Another START representative.
Dave Tiernan. the editor of The
Pitt News, explained that depart-
mental pressure groups could be-
come useful in academic matters.
"Maybe students can be elected
to represent the different depart-
ments on a new Student Council."
said Tiernan.

The Commission will consider
the above mentioned proposals
and any other proposals suggest-
ed by the students at the planned
open meetings. Tiernan made it
clear that START cannot and will
not do anything by themselves.

“The idea is to involve the stu-
dents." explained Tiernan. "The
seniors involved with START are
responsible for establishing the
Commission. Then it will be the
Commission's responsibility to
listen to the students and provide
a new Constitution. one not hastily
contrived during the heat of the
elections. The new Constitution
will hopefully be aimed towards
University governance."

“Steve Cundra

by CINDY MORGAN
Staff Writer

On January 10. the United Stu-
dent Coalition was born. The
point which they believe separ-
ates them from past parties is
the fact that they have brought
together all factions of the stu-
dent body: black and white.
Greek and non—Greek. conserva-
tive and liberal

Steve Cundra. L’SC's candi-
date for Student Government
President. stated at an informal
conference on January 15 with’
Pitt News reporters. "Prior to
this year. there existed narrow
tickets centered around one
thing. such as a group like ROTC.
Two sides seldom came together.
We must unify this campus or
SG just can't exist. A party should
have someone with whome every-
one can identify. Our party line
is whatever your line is."

Cundra continued ‘by dividing
the issues into welfare problems
and policy making difficulties.
Cundra believes that SG in the
past has been lax in notifying
students of its activities. He be-
lieves that SG should regularly
inform the students through the
Pitt News. He emphasized. "The
Pitt News is really the only ef-
fective way of reaching dorm and
commuter students."

The biggest problem the new
party wishes to tackle is that of

re-organizing student govern-
ment. It eventually hopes to in-
tegrate committees and create a
new Senate with 69 members
comprised of 21 faculty, 21 ad-
ministrators, 21 students from

SG. and six graduate students..

They also hope to have Regional
Campus observers. In association
with this re-shuffling of present
committees, they also wish to
urge the university to allow all
students to elect two voting stu-
dents to the Board of Trustees,
and to also have an all-student
Judiciary Board established to
have jurisdiction over all stu-
dents.

Cundra expressed concern over
various rumors being spread over

the campus concerning his party

and himself. The first rumor in-
volved the possibility of his be-
ing anti-Greek. Cundra stressed

‘this was not true. and then he

continued." As a matter of fact.
one of our platforms involves the
construction of a Greek Row
built with University housing
money. After all. it would be
providing more dorm space."

The second rumor about cam-
pus tried to link USC with the
Republican party by saying the
Republicans were supporting
USC with money. Steve reacted
with an emphatic. “Certainly
not!" and said that their funds
came from students and inter-
ested alumni.

—_ Harris Miller

by EVAN PATTAK
Staff Writer

The Student Community Union.
according to its standard-bearer
Harris Miller. hopes to refashion
Student Government in order to
make it more sensitive to student
needs. Miller would like to see.
as the name of his party sug-
gests. a student government
that approximates the concept of
community.

"The power at this University."
noted the sophomore candidate."
lies with the administration and
the faculty. Students. of course.
constitute a major part of the
University Community and have
made some inroads. Hopefully.
we're working for the day when
all members of the University
Community will share in the de-
cision-making process."

Miller believes that the most
important step toward the reali-
zation of this Community is the
abolition of the SG Senate. Mil-
ler. who served as a Senator
along with his running—mate
Shep Goldberg. is convinced of
the Senate's impotency.

“It seems to me,” explained
Miller, _“that the Senate is nei-
ther effective nor representa-
tive. It has dealt with little of
importance in the past. But more
importantly, students have no
power of recall over the Sena-
tors. Once they are elected,
Senators may ignore the stu-

dents, since they are not really
constituents, and they may do
anything they please. For these
reasons, any legislative body at
the University would be super-
fluous.”

Miller plans to use the twelve
standing committees of the Uni-
versity Senate as the locus of
government. Two students cur-
rently sit on each of these com-
mittees. though they have no
voting privileges. Miller pro-
poses to keep the same num-
ber of representatives on each
committee. but according to his
Constitution. they will be elect-
ed instead of appointed. a

“By electing these representa-
tives and giving themfull vot-
ing rights. we may be able to in-
duce more interested. qualified
students to run. The success of
our program depends a good deal
on the success of recruiting the
right people for the right offices."
-Though each committee will
deal with problems that lie in

its specific jurisdiction, all twen-

ty-four elected representatives
will meet together on matters
concerning allocations. Miller

feels that this is the most impor- .

tant area of concern to SG.

"Allocations are what most
students and campus organiza-
tions are concerned about. At
some .universities. special elec-
tions are held to select people
to deal with allocations. Since

we would already have twenty-
four duly elected representa-
tives who could collectively work
with allocations. a special elec-
tion would be unnecessary.“

Miller. the Chairman of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions also hopes to employ the
various SG Committees as liai-
sons between students. faculty.
and administration. These Com-
mittees. filled by appointment.
offer sundry services to students
and handle special functions.
such as Winter Weekend and
Homecoming. Realizing the dis-
array of many of these Com-
mittees. Miller assessed the dif-
ficulty of the task before him.

“There are just so many things
to be done, that it's almost impos-
sible to say where we'll begin.
Many groups have demands
that must be taken care of. We
recognize, of course, the serious-

Cundra then commented on
how to get the student body in-
terested and involved: “We need

senators who go back to the peo-‘

ple and talk. These senators will
also research issues instead of
making snap decisions. To make
these things easier, we would
like to set up a system where
there are so many students per
senator. We are presently using
thecomputer to figure out prac-
tical way of doing this.” ,

The first senator to follow Cun-
dra was CAS freshman Larry
Rebich. The two problems which
interested Rebich the most in-
volved the misuse of activities
fees and the lack of a perman-
ent job recruiter "as most uni-
versities do. so things are not
crammed into one week." Con-
cerning activities ,fees. he ques-
tioned." We have the money
here. so why isn't it being used
for such things as a concert a
month such as they do at Kent
State?“

Another senatorial candidate.
Bob Dunworth. introduced him-
self as a sophomore in pre-med
and an intended chemistry ma-
jor. He began by saying. "My
platform is made of concrete
issues and abstract philosophies.
I am fed up withthe activities
fees being misappropriated.
Where did the money go‘? We
should have better movies. and
a coffee house for those weak-
ends with no dances or movies.“

Another issue which is impor-
tant to Dunworth’ is that of the
parking problem. He hopes to
have the city issue a token sticker
to commuters for small price to
alleviate the present situation. He
believes if the businessmen balk
and refuse to support them they
should be boycotted. “Only as a
last resort,” he added, “would
we jam up any parking meters
with snap-top can rings.”

Dunworth emphasized. “If I
am elected. I plan to give my
blood. sweat. and tears. and not
sit on my thumbs. I am here
to fight and to go out to the
dorm and commuter students.
SG is there to air the demands
of the student. I plan to go
through the proper administra-
tive channels."

To conclude the entire con-
ference. Dunworth said he
couldn‘t see how those who did
not do good jobs as senators
could possibly be good SG pre-
sidents: "They have been losers
in the past . . . I am wonder-
ing if they will be losers in the
future."

University Theatre

The University Theater pre-
sented an adaptation of Feodor
Dostoevs_ki's Notes from Under-
ground last Friday and.Saturday
nights.

The production was a Chamber
Theater adaptation. done in mod-
ern dress. adapted and directed
by John Donnelly. Notes from Un-
derground concerns mans at-
tempts to achieve a personal re-
lationship. however brief or how-
ever unpleasant. first with his
comrades. and then with a young
prostitute. Lisa. played by Fran-
cine Nemitz. He fails at both.

The underground man is lost in
his own inability to approach an-
other human with self—confidence
and trust. He cannot find lasting
companionship or interest. even
when he humiliates himself in
front of other people. Bert Nem-
itz portrayed a forceful sense of
hopelessness and despair. and
emerged as a man so confused
and so overwhelmed by “their”

ence emphasized that the Univer-
sity Theater is an organization
rich in talent and willing to offer
the University community an eve-
ning of professional entertain-
ment.

    Media Propaganda

by BOB GING
Staff Writer

Saturday night, Pittsburgh television viewers

were presented with a film special that they won't
I soon forget. A local station that is known for it‘s
(late night horror films presented a new type of

horror film. The film, “.A- Yank in Vietnam“. did

-“not contain the usual elements of the shock thril-

ler. The horror was supplied by the purpose and

definition of the film which was undisguised pro-
 paganda.

At a time when the American public is so

polarized, “A Yank in Vietnam" is bound to have‘

a great affect on many uninformed and previous-
ly undecided minds. Needless to say. the predict-

 ed affects of the film are not desireable.
The American super-hero was portrayed by .

 “Marshall Thompson who played a Marine heli-

 

copter pilot shot down and captured by the Viet-

ng. During the film,» he and a group of free-
lance South Vietnamese warriors who had rescued

-him from the VC, hunted and killed the enemy

throughout the country. The makers of the film

I  did a fantastic job of justifying any killing done

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
  
   
   
 

by the American Major and his cohorts. and at the
same time managed to have the Vietcong commit
an atrocity every time the latter were in the pic-
ture.’

The portrait of the Vietcong painted by this
picture was a propaganda masterpiece. The VC

’ were shown as merciless killers who ran around

in their black‘ pajamas wantonly shooting up hos-
pitals, burning villages and killing women.

The major and his good guy band of "free-.
. dom fighters“ were spared this image by a ver_v

On Abbie Hoffman

 

' Dave Tieman

Dear Abbie.‘

: After finally getting to hear you speak I read your book.
and just missed you in D.C. when I was de-
tained somewhere near DuPont Circle) I am writing you a let-

Woodstock Nation,

ter asking for advice.

Abbie, I need your advice on some very pressing matters:

clever technique. The people they killed were
all stereotype Vietcong. while the Vietcong only
killed people who were of some emotional signi-
ficance of who had personalities for which the
audience could feel sympathy.

The horror of the movie came to me when I
sat back and realized that what I was watching
was not merely another movie where the all-just
Americans won in the end. “A Yank in Vietnam"
was a powerfully slanted film depicting the war
in Vietnam as another vehicle used to enhance the
glory of America. As I continued watching I was
haunted by memories of 1894 where this type of
film was the rule rather than the exception.

The greatest atrocity of the evening though.
was committed neither by the Vietcong nor the
Major and his "white hat" colleagues. but by
the television station that permitted this movie
to be shown. This picture caused me to question
what type of society could possibly condone any
type of a war as a glorious and noble thing in
which to participate.

In the past. we have accused Communist na-
tions throughout the world of presenting propa-
ganda on the media to distort the reality of their
positions in any type of conflict. My esteem for
my country is considerably lowered. now that I
see America using the same ploys that its people
have so vehemently condemned for so long a time.

A great burden has been placed on the people
in this country. When our own media has no
qualms about distorting the truth. the people must
take it upon themselves to see that movies like
"A Yank in Vietnam" are not used as propaganda
by our government or any other interest group.

After much research into this
perplexing question. I have come
to the conclusion that Richard
Nixon is undoubtedly dead. The
clues are everywhere: in pic-
tures. on albums. and in
speeches.

  

Let me remind the reader that
about a year ago. a Richard Nix-
on look-alike contest was held
in Look-Alike. Montana. The win-
ner of that contest was a Coca-
Cola bottler named Campbell.
Campbell has not been heard from
since. My guess. and also the
guess of many others. is that
Campbell has been standing in
for Nixon when Nixon‘s presence
is needed. When the President's

 

’ some things about which you spoke the other night. How. for

instance. do you win the minds of the seven-year-olds for the revo-
lution, when the college students. "have permanent chromosonal
damage". won't even listen. I mean won‘t even listen. to the ideas
of anyone but their parents. their pinmates. or the Pig publica-
tion here. The Pittsburgh Press.

Like I dig your Yippie philosophy. I think everything should
be fun—not work. But when you ask some seven-year-old what
the most important thing in his life is or will be. he'll tell you it‘s
how much money he’s gonna make. now he's gonna go to col-
lege. or how he's gonna play professional football. Parents.
schools, religious denominations tell kids that if something is
more fun than work. it's wrong. And Abbie. you knocked John
Lennon. He'll win far more minds than you. or Bobby Seale. or
Rene Davis. or anyone ever will. Does that make him wrong? I

‘ . _ mean, can‘t you fit him to your plans anywhere‘? My niece digs

"Yellow Submarine".and she's not even two yet.

Another thing I didn‘t quite understand. Abbie. was your
instruction to the freaks here in Pittsburgh about future activi-
ties. You told us to get lawyers to speak to us about staying out
of jail, yet you know damn well that there aren’t two thousand
lawyers in the U.S. of A. who could sway the minds of a jury who

‘is hand-picked in two hours. averages 54 years of age. agrees with

the rest of the dummies that they represent democracy. and honest-
ly think that Nixon and Agnew and the rest of the rich Pigs in this
country give a damn about their opinions. even though they have
been labled the “silent majority" I think we need more comedians
like you who can make us laugh at this country. laugh at author--
ity figures. and most important of all. laugh at ourselves. That's

another area in which I need your advice.

You don't take yourself seriously. do you? I mean. some
people use humor to make a point. even if that point is something
as simple as showing other people that they have a talent for

making people laugh. But you laughed at yourself. You were up

there entertaining yourself. I'm sure you sit in the courtroom in
Chicago and laugh yourself sick at your own jokes. That's an art.

‘man, an art you should teach others. I know how hard I try to

laugh at things and all (maybe I don't do enough grass) but I
still end up taking things too seriously. As a friend of mine said
the other day, "You have to laugh at things like the Trial in Chi-
cago. If you take things that farce seriously. you'll end up killing
all the pigs in the world." And he‘s right. Abbie. for you rapped
every person in the place the other night. and if you took them

_; seriously. you’d kill them. right?

voice is needed. David Frye pro-
vides it.

If You Can Dig It

Revolution Won

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Ex-Revolutionary

It happened a short while ago.
As I recall. That the revolution
is over. But it really isn't that
important when. only that it
did. Somehow the event excaped
the news media but then again
I don't think they would have
cared because they would have
chosen not to believe (peace
doesn‘t sell).

The turmoil has ceased. Dif-
ferent styles of life no longer
compete with each other for
control of the system. The long
hard days of fighting have end-
ed. In victory. ~

Complete and total freedom
of the spirit prevails. Adjust-
ment to liberation has been awk-
ward at times. But here is what
is happening:

— Complete equality. Which
includes the sexes. Assertion and
recognition of individuality. One
does as one defines. The choices
are one’s own. Marriage is op-
tional and lasts as long as the
individuals decide that it should.
One does not restrict his choice
for marriage partners to a single
member of the opposite sex. As

I 3 Richard   Nixon

A further clue is ‘on David

Frye‘s new album. “I Am the’

President." If one tapes this al-
bum and plays it back with the
tape reversed. and at 57 times
the normal speed (Nixon would
be 57 today “If" he were still
alive). one can hear between
the second and third tracks the
following: the yell "fore“ the
thudof a golf-ball hitting a hol-
low head; and a voice that is
distinctively of Richard Nixon
slowly muttering with dying
breath. "Let me makeone thing
clear. I am the President.“ This
is apparently the death of Nixon.

‘ Shortly after the election not
too many. but a few of the wire
services picked up a story that
Nixon. while standing on the
third tee of the Pebble Beach
Golf Club. was hit on the head

marriage is an agreement be-
tween individuals based on trust,
it is no longer necessary that it
be written down on paper (i.e.
licensed) or published in news-
papers.

~ Freedom of speech and press.
One speaks. writes. and reads
according to one‘s wishes. The
individual is also'free not to
speak. write. or read what one
does not wish.

~— Total academic freedom.
Freedom to choose what courses
one wants to study and the Uni-
versity (or universities if uni-
versities) where one wishes to
study. Grades have been elimin-
ated as they are no longer nec-
essary. Evaluation is self-deter-
mined. And. of course. degrees
no longer need be granted.

— Termination of the draft.
Warfare has ended. Everyone re-
fuses to fight.

— Richard Nixon is no longer
President of the United States.
Spiro T. Agnew does not exist.

— The United States no longer
exists. There are no such things
as nations. Only people. We are
self-governed.

—— Peace is now.

Dead?

by a golf ball hit by Mrs. Spiro
Agnew. I

There are many clues in mag-
azines which led me to the same
conclusion. ,Mad magazine of
October, 1969, had a picture of
Richard Nixon wearing an arm-
band with the letters “DOA” on
it. “DOA” is-the way many Amer-
icans express the phrase “Dead
on arrival.”

Another picture was in Con-
vention, a magazine put out dur-
ing the summer Presidential con-
ventions. The picture shows
Nixon with Ted Kennedy. Hubert
Humphrey. and Eugene McCar-
thy. Nixon is clearly wearing a
button with an elephant on it.
while the other three are each
wearing buttons with donkeys
on them. Now. why is Nixon
wearing a different kind of but-
ton? The answer is simple — Nix-
on is dead.

Not too long after that issue.
I saw a picture in Dude maga-
zine of Richard Nixon. Mel Laird.
and John Mitchell. all standing
by the ocean in Miami Beach.
Nison is dressed in a bathing
suit and is not wearing shoes.

Why was Nixon not wearing
shoes while the others. who had
just returned from a surprise
party for Eldridge Cleaver
(not Beaver‘s brother). were plain-

ly wearing shoes? When a corpse ,

is to be burned. his shoes are
taken off.

Remember Spiro Agnew's
speech lambasting the television
newscasters‘? I taped that speech.
reversed it. and played it back
twelve times the normal speed.

(Twelve is the I.Q. of Spiro
agnew. ) At one point. Agnew
unmistakably : says. I bury

Dick. I bury Dick."

So you ask. why are a few

people keeping this from the
rest of the country‘? Spiro Ag-
new doesn't even know. If he
knew. he would probably want
the job. and if the rest of the
country knew. he would probably
get the job. because the Silent
Majority would raise such a
fuss.
. The few people that do know
about Nixon‘s death——including
myself—figure that the body of
this ‘guy Campbell with the
voice of David Frye is better
than Spiro Agnew.

 

   

PREFACE

We present this set of propos-
als for changes in undergraduate
education in the Colleges of Arts
and Sciences so that the fullest
possible discussions can take
place before the proposals are
submitted in the final form to the
CASC and FAS for legislative ac-
tion later in the Winter Term. Im-
mediately following the introduc-
tion. the proposals are presented
in two forms: (1)_a brief outline.
and (2) a more detailed write up.

This interim report describes
the proposals which deal most

‘ centrally with structural changes

in the curriculum and arrange-
ments under which liberal arts
education is to take place. It is
proposed that those be instituted
in ‘the fall term of 1970. In later
reports. we will describe more
fully some of the innovations
which departments are urged to
adopt in their programs for stu-
dents beyond the freshman year.
We expect also to propose ways

of evaluating the new educational.

procedures we advocate. and to
increase the emphasis on improv-
ing the teaching role of the fac-
ulty. In addition we will deal with
some fundamentally important
matters which should be imple-
mented in concert with the new
curriculum: admissions. college-
community relations. physical fa-
cilities (campus design. dormi-
tory design. and commuter
needs) and advising and orienta-
tion.
INTRODUCTION

Several points should be kept in
mind as the proposals are consi-
dered:

A. We are not proposing ‘that
any path now open to an under-
graduate student in Arts and Sci-
ences be closed. but that new and
necessary ones be opened.

B. We are not proposing a small.
elite. experimental college which
would exist. as a professor de-
scribed once at another urban uni-
versity. as an "island of artisto-
cratic education": rather. we are
convinced that the new options to
be opened will be found significant
and appealing by a wide cross-
section of Pitt students and will
come to enlarge the concept of
learning for the entire College.

C. The new options being pro-
posed are in most cases exten-
sions of practices already in exis-
tence at the University of Pitts-
burgh. and some have been used
at other colleges for as long as 40
years.

D. The proposals do include the
removal of all specific and distri-
butional course requirements ex-
cept those set for the students’
majors by the academic depart-
ments. and provide. for the stu-
dent who chooses it. a path to the
Bachelor's degree without grades
(a credit no entry system) and
without a specified major.

OUTLINE
OF INTERIM REPORT

1. NEW OPTION
FOR FRESHMAN
A. Aims

1. To offer freshmen a program
in which there is freedom for sig-
nificant learning. not simply free-
dom from restrictions.

2. To offer students the oppor-
tunity for self-directed study (the
pursuit of his own academic in-
terests and development at his
own pace). free from the need to

t compete for grades.
_3*,To engage the entering stu-gj

8

 
  
 

with the faculty on major issues
concerning himself.
and the university.

4. To help student discover ways
in which the resources of a large
and complex university in an ur-
ban community can be used to
deepen his understanding’ of these
issues. lead him to self-defini-
tion. and enlarge his capacity for
useful and relevant action.

B. Structure

1. Establish groups of 15 stu-
dents and one faculty mentor (or.
in a few cases. two co-mentors ).

2. Award 15 ungraded credits
per term. for a maximum of two
terms. - -

3. Provide options for mobility
among and out of groups.

C. Methods—Operation
of Mentor Group .

1. Discussion sessions asset by
group.
2. Individual advising by men-
tor. .

3. Voluntary exploration of uni-
versity resources.

4. Voluntary participation in
lectures. demonstrations. and
other new activities designed for
this program.

5. Optional enrollment in some
regular courses (ordinarily not
more than two. and not for extra
credtis) with continued participa-
tion in the mentor group.

D. Program—Structured
Exposure to Resources
of University

1. Mentors should offer lectures
or demonstrations open to all on
the nature of their discipline or
profession and on how it responds.
or ought to respond. to basic is-

.sues of human concern.

2. Departments. professional
schools. and invited speakers
should provide “star" lectures on
broad and specific aspects of
their disciplines or jobs. covering
such topics as an introduction to a
discipline and the requirements
and rewards of specific types of
pursuits.

3. Experimental courses should
be set up in which the emphasis is
on learning by experimentation in
such areas as mathematics and
some social sciences.

4. Language laboratories and
programmed instruction should
be made available for students

’who wish to study fields where

there is a high degree of structure.

5. The present offerings of
plays. films. music. and dances
are available to all students and
should continue to expand: in ad-
dition. departments and groups
concerned with the performing
arts should plan opportunities for
freshmen to receive instruction
and participate actively. especial-
ly in workshop productions.

6. Opportunities for learning
athletic skills and participating in
non-commercial sports should
be expanded.

7. Workshops on current and
relevant issues should be sched-
uled. and students should be en-
couraged to create their own
workshops and invite persons of
their choice to participate in them.

8. Career seminars by people
from a wide variety of occupa-
tions should be present in which
careers will be explored deeply
and from every angle.

9. Field work projects should be
arranged through the University's
contracts in the community or by
the student: the work, may be _ei-
thew . i  

 
    

  

the society.

    

pending upon the desire and need
of each student. and the work will
be considered as part of the curri-
culum.

10. Many campus activities pre-
viously designated as "extra-cur-
-ricular" will be regarded as rel-
evant to the students learning
process and self-development.

E. Evaluation Procedures

1. During his freshman year the
student will keep a portfolio which
will replace the present trans-
cript as evidence of the student's
progress: the portfolio may be
continued thereafter.

2. Student will be encouraged to
provide written evaluation of their
development and activities by the
end of the second term: once read
by the mentor. this may enter the
student's portfolio (a minority of
the ASRC feels that freshmen
should be required to make an en-
try each term in their portfolios).

3. Faculty mentor provides
written evaluation of each stu-
dent's progress to student. who
may put a copy in his portfolio.

4. Portfolio is kept by the Uni-
versity for the student: only the
student and those people to whom
he grants permission may look at
his portfolio: also. anything (pa-
pers. photographs of art work.
etc.) the student considers indi-
cative of his education or self-de-
velopment. at the present time or
for future reference. can be plac-
ed in his portfolio.

.5. Mentors prepare general

evaluation of their group as a’

whole (evaluative of process. not
persons) for submission at end of
each term to the Dean's office.

F. Faculty ‘

1. Faculty mentors (approxi-
mately one hundred) to be drawn
from CAS and from Professional
Schools. ordinarily for a one year
period. '

2. Faculty to be recruited from
volunteers with approval of appro-
priate chairmen of CAS depart-
ments and)or deans of Profes-
sional Schools.

3. Job to be rated from about
half to full load (each group equals
15 students ((1 15 credits each
equals 225 credits): half rating
would permit volunteers from
small departments where they
doubtless could not be spared
from departmental major work
or graduate programs; full-time
mentors would take on extra du-
ties (such as giving short lec-
ture series) to balance the work
load.

4. Graduate students to be as-
signed to this program (with com-
pensation) on basis of volunteer-
ing. availability. and approval by
appropriate chairmen: they may
serve as co-mentors where facul-
ty mentor is not full time.

5. Final staff approval to rest
with Dean of CAS and Freshman
Program Committee.

G. Administrative Staff
1. Small.

2. Under administrative pur-
view of Dean of CAS and a new
Freshman Program Committee.

3. Establishes and operates a
“Communication Center" for
several purposes :

a. To schedule and publicize all
parts of Freshman Program of an
interest wider than that of a sin-
gle group.

b. To assist mentors. and groups

I in contacting expertise withinand
I without. the University respon ‘v

     

» but all «taught irriways, 
V-two .$~ Inp$_jion.S ' .a'

c. To provide information inter-
change among groups.

d. To create a place for fresh-
men. with or without their men-
tor groups. to meet — a large
"freshman lounge" in a central
place. '

4. To handle shifts of students
in and out of mentor program and
between groups.

5. To compile periodic reports
on the Freshman Program. based
on the submitted mentors‘ reports.

II. PATHS TO THE
BACHELOR’S DEGREE

Two major alternatives tracks
to the Bachelor‘s degree will be
available:

A. Track I—Generalized Bach-
elor‘s degree—— ‘

1. Neither the identification of a
major nor certification by a de-
partment is required.

2. Accumulation of 120 credits
is required; credits can be dis-
tributed as the student chooses.

B. Track II—Specialized Bach-
elor's degree-

1. Area of concentration is spe-
cified. either by a department. by
an interdisciplinary committee. or
as an approved self-designed ma-
jor.

2. Accumulation of 120 credits
is required; not more than 40
credits in one department can be
required for a major.

III. EVALUATION OPTIONS

(A student pursuing either
Track I or Track II will have two
choices of evaluation; this in-
cludes those freshmen" who have
not chosen the mentor program. )

A. Credit/No Entry
1. If. in the opinion of an in-

. structor. the student deserves the

credits. then the student will re-
ceive them; otherwise. there will
be no record that the course was
ever taken.

21 A portfolio will be kept by the
University for each student's use;
a student will contribute‘ any in-
formation or evidence which he
feels reveals his educational ex-
perience.

B.‘ Grades .

‘1. Students will have the tradi-
tional transcript and grading pro-
cedure (as at present)

2. An unlimited number of
S U's are available. except when
restrictions are placed on depart-
mental majors in their major
courses.

3. A portfolio will be kept for
these students: they will be en-
couraged to contribute to it.

IV. ONE TERM
INDEPENDENT STUDY

A. There is available for sopho-
mores. juniors. and seniors a one
term (15 credit block) indepen-
dent study option.

B. Student chooses a faculty
sponsor to approve his project for
the term.

C. A minority of the ASRC be-
lieves that this option should be
available to freshmen.

THE INTERIM REPORT

I. THE NEW FRESHMAN
OPTION

The ASRC recommends that the
educational climate f'or incoming
first-year students be expanded.
Various educational options
should be available. Presently a
student takes four or five courses
——some required. some elected——

group provides an atmosphere in ,
which a student can learn V‘ the
meaning of self-directed study
and in which such study can flour-
ish. The goal is to allow the .S’tu-g. .
dent not only to master materials,
but (1) to become a learner and
(2) to develop a sense of what it p
means to be a learner (what 0. K. A‘

tion in education). Furthermore‘,

Organization :

dents, at first randomly selected
' om the incoming class,‘ with pro-
vision for mobility among and out
of groups. Basically, however, ar-
bitrary ‘ groupings will tend to
bring into close ‘contact individ-
rials who might otherwise have
never gotten to know one another.
Commuter students, especially.
will have the chance to _form
"rong; meaningful ties with on-
campus people. For the most part.
the» ASR_C feels that greater
strides toward human awareness
and liberation will take place if
thefgroups are composed of stu-
dents with heterogeneous inter-
T tests’, abilities, and backgrounds.

- Each group will have one facul-
ty._mento"r, or two co-mentors. a
' culty. member and a graduate
student. Mentors will be drawn
f‘.I.‘?0.m"volurnteers from the Faculty
' ' Artsand Sciences and from the
professional schools to the degree

course. the mentor may give only-
lialf to M two-thirds of his time to

The mentor has one central re-
onsibility — that is to meet with
is group together and individual-
ly. The group meets where and
and when it wishes to. The stu-
dents also are free of all courses.
(Thee possible exceptions will be
discussed 3 below. ) Consequently.
they can meet regularly or irreg-
ularly, .on' campus or off. at their

ences. acting primarily as advisor.
 The student participating in this
program would get a block of 15
Cre'dits each term. for a maxi-
mum of two terms. regardless of
the specific activities in which he
would be engaged. There would be
no grades. On the other hand. the
ASRC feels that a student is en-
titled to evaluation of his work
andjprogress. He should expect to
hear regular informal evaluation
from his peers in the group and
his-(mentor at the end of each term
. at other suitable times.

An important part of the stu-
dent's development and evalua-
ff tiQ_n will depend on the creation of
“*-this “portfolio." The portfolio is a
 record ‘of his undertakings. ex-
periences. and achievements dur-
ing the freshman year kept by the
University for the student. It may
contain papers. results of experi-
ments, musical compositions. pho-

statements of the students and of
his fellow students—in short. any
information or evidence which the
student believes reveals his edu-
cational experience. The mentors
will actively encourage students
to develop their portfolios. as they
will represent not merely a.rec-
ord of the students performance

but will also serve the important.

function of developing the skills
of self-evaluation.* Early in the
first term. each mentor group will
discuss procedures and styles of
portfolio development. (Several
Pitt professional school deans
have expressed their hope that
the College of Arts and Sciences

would adopt the portfolio proce-‘

dure for the students’ whole aca-
demic careers since these would
allow more meaningful evaluation
than the current grade transcript. )

The program cannot operate op-
timally in a structured atmos-
phere — e.g.. fixed meeting times.
rooms assigned by hour. etc. Le-
bensraum is necessary — space

i set aside for the whole mentor

group program. Groups should be
able to expect to find space when

it is needed on campus. whether

for an hour. an afternoon. or a
whole day. The ASRC assumes
that future building construction
can keep the needs of the fresh-
man stage in mind. Meanwhile.
temporary areas would have to be
turned over to the freshman pro-
gram. Perhaps the Nationality
Rooms could be set aside. or one

floor of small offices in Schenley

Hall.

The new freshman program will
require some new administrative
arrangements. but it is vital that
this be small and simple. We pro-
pose a staff to operate under a
Freshman Program Committee of
faculty and students which would
report to the Dean of CAS. The
Freshman Program Committee
will set policy and arrange for
many of the new activities avail-
able to Freshmen. It will aslo
make periodic reports on the pro-
gram based on mentors‘ reports
and its own observations.

The staff would establish and
operate the Communications Cen-
ter imentioned below )' and would
arrange for initial assignment of
incoming students to mentor
groups and for transfer of stu-
dents to new mentors if serious
complaints are received.
Activities:

There are two kinds of activ-
ities designed for mentor group
freshmen: (1) those that occur
within the groups and (2) those
that are set up by the freshman
faculty and the greater College
community for the freshmen and
other interested students.

It is very difficult. and even det-
trimental. to set up a fixed model
for what may happen within a
mentor group. since the whole
idea rests on the notion that each
group will be the unique manifes-
tation of its own intellectual and
emotional needs. Even a descrip-
tion of group dynamics is difficult
since no two "communities" will
(or should) develop exactly alike.
(Of course intelligent group lead-
ership will see to it that some kind
of community develops. ) But each
group and mentor will attempt to
focus attention. whenever neces-
sary. on the problems of adjust-
ment and alienation facing every
student.

As the group defines itself and
its dominant interests. it will turn
its attention to study projects. ei-
ther as a whole group where this
is possible. or as sub-groups. or
individually. These study projects
promise to be extremely valuable
and much more educative and
scholarly than papers and exams

in present freshman courses. Not V

onlywill thefstudent have suffi-

‘cient1.ti.me.j.to involve himjself inhis

investigations. but the project will
be self-generated and will satisfy
real. personal interests. Second.
the student will be in constant
communication with a mentor
(i.e.. a teacher-scholar-advisor)
who knows how to learn. Third.
the student can be put in touch
with the University‘s resources
as they can explore the resources
of the Frick Museum and Library
together. or the mentor can in-
troduce the student to another
mentor from the Physics Depart-

ment (or any other department)..

if such a contact could be benefi-
cial to the student. The possibil-
ities are endless. The ASRC firm-
ly believes that academic quality
can only improve in such an at-
mosphere and that the experience
of a long-range. in-depth study is

likely to be personally enriching T

and enjoyable for the freshman.

'A major feature of the mentor
group activity will be the atten-
tion it pays to career guidance.
both in the group and in confer-
ences. This activity will not be
shallows‘ (cf. "career days" in
most high schools). The object
will be to explore career options
from every angle. If ten students
are clear about their job needs.
then the group as a whole may by-
pass the career discussions. while
the mentor may wish to work pri-
vately and regularly with the
other two to five students about
career options and information.
Th ASRC hopes and recommends
that every department in the Col-
lege’ and every professional school
will prepare a detailed manual.
providing the freshman and others
with necessary information con-
cerning the highways and by-wa_vs
of their particular disciplines:
preparation for professional
study: requirements of the ma-
jor: job description and variety:
the demands. rewards. and short-
comings of the work: salaries: op-
portunities. etc. Of course. there

is every reasonto believe that.

many of the study projects in the
group will stem directly or indi-
rectly from the career discus-
sions.

Besides the study projects and
career investigations. in-group
acitvity will hopefully include
community-action projects. util-
ization of the resources of the
city (through visits. apprentice-
ships. interviews. etc.). perhaps
even some travel. since the stu-
dents and mentor are free to or-
ganize their own time. These ac-
tivities could obviously furnish
materials for written work. dis-
cussion sessions. reading proj-
ects. personal evaluation. etc.

It is very important to note
that. even though these in-group
activities could reasonably ex-
pand to full-time involvement for
freshmen and mentors. the ASRC
also proposes what was referred
to above as activities set up by a
freshman faculty and the greater
College community. The Commit-
tee envisions a program available
to all students to which they may
respond on an entirely voluntary
basis. In proposing an expanded
program for the freshman stage.
the ASRC hopes that a rich envir-
onment will exist in which stu-
dents can try out their interests.
explore new ideas. and develop
new competencies. The following
suggestions constitute a program
in the sense that there will be con-
tent planned for variety; sched-
uled as to time and place (cf. the
in-group activities). and announc-
ed in advance. There should also
be events which arise from stu-
dent interests and provision to an-
nounce these to all students.

Each department and profes-
sional school should provide a
series of "star" lectures. design-
ed to introduce new students to
the nature of a specific field.[The

fuller range of introductory ex-
periences. such as careers sem-
inars. making use of people from
a wide variety ofoccupations —
e.g.. physicians. public officials.
elementary school teachers. law-
yers. business) executives. artists.
journalists. etc. —— each of whom
would spend two weeks or more
in residence on campus. Primari-
ly. each visitor would meet with
snail groups of interested stu-
dents and talk about the content
of his life. the relevance of educa-
tion to him. his perception of the
major issues of his work. etc. (In
addition. the "in residence" con-
cept could include other sorts of
people whose contribution to cam-
pus life and student development
is not in vocational directions. but
in bringing social issues in a liv-
ing form to Pitt. For example.
welfare mothers. Appalachoan
miners or storekeepers. persons
with firsthand experience of the
penal system. and a variet_y of
critics or upholders of the domin-
ant institutions and practices of
our society.) Departments should
be urged to run various work-
shops. experimental study groups.
specially designed short courses.
and the like; These activities
should occur throughout the term

and should repeat frequently in"

order to’ satisfy student needs as
the_v arise.

The present offerings of plays.
films. music. and dance are. of
course. available to freshmen. But
additional time. concentration.
and information could increase
the chance that a freshman would
go. As a freshman stage activity.
such offerings should be consider-

ably expanded. The departments»

and groups which are concerned
with performing and studio arts
should plan opportunities for new-
comers to receive instruction and
participate. especially in work-
shop productions and other per-
sonally satisfying activities. The

aim ought to be active develop—‘

ment of creative skills as well as
‘increased audiences.

Similarly. there should be an
expansion of opportunities for
learning athletic skills and parti-
cipating in non-commercial
sports. The skills of the faculty in
physical education could be used
in small classes and individual in-
struction of interested students.
now that they no longer must cope
with large required classes.

Students who work part-time
should be encouraged to consider
their jobs part of the curriculum.
not purely a distraction or neces-
sary eveil. Consideration of the
economic and technical aspects
of their work. its social role.ihu-
man relations on the job. and so
forth. would help to relate work
to other learning.

Central to all of these activities
should be a freshman Communi-
cations Center which would pro-
vide students with up-to-date an-

nouncementsofallsorts of events. '

from those now considered
"courses" to those now consider-
ed “extra-curricular." “I would
put out weekly or daily listings.
but would also provide inter-
change of information amoung
learning groups. discussions of
cultural offerings before and af-
ter their occurence. and a place to
meet other freshmen and ex-
change ideas informally.

Many activities which tradi-
tionally have been viewed as ex-
ti'a-curricular could become an in-
tegral part of the learning experi-
ence of freshmen. Such activities
might include student govern-
ment. political organizations. de-
bate clubs. Pitt News, WPGH. and
most of the others.

All these programs-—m_any of

which are nowbeing tried—-would ‘

become part of the; fre_shnian

would be expected and advised.
though never coerced. to take ad-
vantage of a representative num-
ber of these activities which do

not involve the mentor groups di- -

rectly: lectures. films. plays.
clubs. and the like. As well. the
ASRC assumes that a freshman.
especially one- with a clear sense
of direction. may take a reason-
able number of regular courses.
too——ordinarily not more than two.
The mentor and student would de-
cide the feasibility of such action.
All regular courses taken in the
freshman program would be with-
out credits or grades. although a
notation could be made on some
sort of transcript stating which
courses had been attended.

An Imaginary, Sample
Mentor Group Student:

This student finds afterseveral
attempts that she does not work
well with the whole group which
has taken a scientific direction.

-Our student and two friends de-

cided that they are much more in-
terested in literature and related
arts. These three girls‘ decide to
take on ajproject of reading mod-
ern European novels. The men-
tor reads the novels: too-—he has
the time——but he also invites an-

) other mentor. a professor of Ger-

man language and literature. to
join the small discussion group
which meets once a week or once
in ten’ days. Two of the girls de-
cide to write a series of short pa-
pers: our student elects to keep a
detailed journal of her intellectual
and ‘emotional responses to the
novels and related criticism. (The
German professor helps her find
valuable secondary information;
he spends an afternoon with her
at the Carnegie Library.) She tries
out for the Theater Department's
production of Durrenmatt‘s The
Visitfandj gets a respectable part.
She spends a good deal of time re-
hearsing. but also has enough time
to work on publicity for the play.
(She has some gift for art and de-
sign.) Her mentor learns that she
was unhappy with the larger group
because of real inadequacies. as
a result of poor prior training. in
basic mathematics. Because he
promises to give her tutorial help
(he has the time). she promises

to audit a mathematics course.'

She would like to make up her
deficiency. and this ungraded

‘course and supportive tutoring

may be her best and last chance
to learn math. She finds that she
spends more time than she
thought she would on this task.
She belongs to no clubs or organ-
izations. but very seldom misses
a good lecture when someone in-
teresting comes to the campus.
and she squeezes in a two-week
workshop with the visiting novel-
ist ("career" activity).

The ASRC believes that the at-
mosphere of the mentor groups
would be highly conducive to ex-
citing educational experiences.
The mentor system would pro-
vide real psychological support
and direction whenever neces-
sary. Alienated and unhappy stu-
dents would find a faculty mem-
ber who is interested. willing to
help. and aware of the. University
and community resources. The
student who is utterly unable or
unwilling to participate would at
least be in a relationship with an
advisor who could recomend al-
ternatives—e.g.. a job. psycho-
therapy. travel. or even another
college. The unanimouse ASRC
conviction is that even a small
academic project of genuine per-
sonal interest to the student. if

carried out with a sense of com- T
meticuloujsnesrs. . and j .
. self-respect. is of -paramount im-

mitment.

II. PATHS TO THE
BACI-lELOR’S DEGREE

The aims of the expanded.op-
tions beyond the freshman year
are twofold: first. to provide al-
ternatives to the organizing ap-
proaches to the world which are
represented by established aca-
demic departments (both recent-
ly acknowledged problem-oriented
approaches such as ecology or
communications. and other more
personal views which are devel-
oped by students) and second. to

f make it possible for the student

“who has learned how to pursue

self-directed learning to continue
in this mode throughout his college
career.

These aims are met by provid-
ing two major alternative
"tracks" to the Bachelors de-
gree (with certain options within
each one). and by providing new
grading options for all students
and liberalizing somewhat the
choice of independent study.

Track 1- .

Generalized Bachelor’s Degree:
This new degree option differs

from‘ those now available in that

it does not require identification

of a major nor certification by a

 department. To obtain the gener-

alized Bachelors degree. a stu—
dent must accumulate a total of
120 credits. distributed as he
chooses. /(A procedure to deter-
mine when this degree is to be a
B.A. and when a B.S. will be work-
ed out and proposed in the report
submitted for legislative action.)

Track II— ‘
Specified Bachelor’s Degree:

In this track the subject matter
area of concentration is specified.
in most cases by a department, in
some cases by an interdisciplin-
ary committee or as an approved

tgelf-designed major.

The departmental program des-
criptions which were recommend-
ed above for use in the freshman
program should also clearly state
the courses which each depart-
ment requires in order to certi-
fy majors (no requirement to be
more than 40 hours in one depart-
ment). We are also asking that
each department establish proce-
dures to evaluatethe portfolios of
students who do not complete all
course requirements but feel that
they can show equivalent inde-
pendently produced work. The stu-
dent is to choose his advisor from

ﬁlls major area of study and they

will work together to build a port-
folio consisting of relevant ma-
terials amassed during his col-
lege experience (e.g.. papers.
tests. research projects. recom-
mendations. tapes. films. etc.)
which the student feels substanti-
ate his proficiency in his given
field. During the term preceding
his graduation term. he would pe-
tition the department in which he
would like to receive a degree to
review his portfolio to determine
whether or not he has proven com-
petence to be granted a B.A. in
that field. If the department does
not grant his request. he may still
receive the generalized degree.

-1’; The self -designedﬂmajor pro-

gram. which was established two
years ago. should also be made
somewhat more accessible. Stu-
dents with more than 45 credits
but less than 80 credits will be eli-
gible to present a rationale (i.e.
the students‘ reasons for deserv-
ing this and the areas he plans to
investigate) f'or a self-designed
program of study. As at present.
this proposal should go to the
committee set up by the Dean of
GAS to review such proposals. Be-
cause of the continual expansion
of departments and courses. it
would be unnecessary for the stu-

fﬁent to itemize in his proposal all

those courses he expects to take

.m»..h1s.§e)f*de«s18"e" “*“J°?f;.P“°‘ 1 mm mvre;aware»(of.

gram. Likewise. there is no need
for the present requirement that
courses be taken in at least three
departments. These changes will
give the program an added flex-
ibility since he would be able to
develop his program in directions
appropriate to expanding his un-
derstanding.

III. EVALUATION OPTIONS

Grades:

For any student who chooses it
(except a freshman in the men-
tor program) the existing system
is available (i.e.. A. B. C. D. F

S grading); we propose only that

the option of S, U grading be avail-
able for any number of courses
each term.

It is expected that students

choosing this system will concen-~

trate on achieving a course trans-
cript as external evidence of their
education. although any who wish
to may. of course. also keep a
portfolio of work.

Credit/No Entry:
Alternatively. any student may

choose to do his work on a Credit) .

No Entry basis. Under this sys-
tem he will either receive credit
for a course or it will not appear
at all on his transcript nor in any
record". ' "

Students choosing this option
would ordinarily be those who had
become convinced that they did
not need letter grades to moti-
vate their learning and that a
portfolio of work and evaluations
was a more effective indicator of
their learning to others than the
traditional transcript.

Students would be able to
change from one system to the
other if they changed their atti-
tude toward evaluation. but not to
use both systems in any single
term.

IV. INDEPENDENT
STUDY TERM

Any student in the College
should be allowed to take a block
of up to 15 credits of independent
studies for at least one term dur-
ing his enrollment at the Univer-
sity. The student who chooses to
do so must find a professor (or
professors) who would be willing
to serve as the student’s sponsor
for the Independent Study Term.
Normally a student would be al-
lowed only one Independent Study
Term. ‘

The sponsor acts as a councilor
for the student on the student's
plans for research. Grading under
such a program would be deter-
mined by each student. Under the
traditional system the student
would be given a letter grade
or satisfactory/unsatisfactory
greade. Under the_alternative sys-
tem he would be given credit (and
a contribution would be added to
his portfolio) or no entry would be
made. In the event that the stu-
dent wishes to continue the spe-
cial research beyond one term. he
and his sponsor would need the
approval of the Dean of the Col-
lege.

This type of Independent Study
Term would allow the student to
live and function in an academic
environment while working on

the humanities and sciences (nat-
ural and social) to seek knowledge
outside of the University complex

results with the aid of the Univer-
sity facilities. Students would also
be allowed to form groups which
could work together on particular
problems. A student who may not

*A minority of the Committee (Loerke and
Townsend) believes that a freshman in the
mentor program should be required to make
a contribution to his portfolio each term.
They argue that such a requirement would
encourage those students who have a ten-
dency to postpone their work to complete
it and evaluate it.

**A minority of the Committee (Bannis-

the Independent Study Term option should
also be available to the freshman who can

, demonstrate to a faculty member that he

has a valid and productive project. The sig-
nificant difference between such an option
and mentor group participation is that in
the former case the student makes the
choice of faculty sponsor. instead of being
assigned to him. In the absence of this fresh-
man option. Mr. Bannister adds the follow-
ing statement:

"I feel that the freshman mentor pro-
gram does not offer a free option for those
non-white freshmen students attending the

College. Its group structure (though this is .

strongly disagreed to by the other ASRC
members) is inherently paternalistic and
promotes a typeof ‘culture reviewing’ pro-

cess which will not afford a non-white stu— I

dent the ability to see the University (which
is the purpose of the program) in its true
form. I feel that this prob1em—non-whites is
a basically white-oriented University—has
been generally overlooked by the commit-
tee.“

APPENDIX A

INNOVATION ON OTHER
COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The urge to produce construc-
tive changes in curriculum is by
no means limited to the efforts at
the University of Pittsburgh. On
the contrary. there is a wide-
spread interest in curriculum in-
novation. some of it extending
back 50 years. The following
sketches of curriculum experi-
ments and new programs are giv-
en in an effort to place the pre-
sent ASRC proposals in a proper
perspective.

Bennington. Goddard and Sarah
Lawrence are three colleges
which depart dramatically from
the traditional programs. Rahter
than the usual emphasis on cred-
its. requirements. and grades.
these schools are committed to
providing flexible and individual-
ized routes to the bachelor's de-

gree: evaluation is considered as’

a crucial and complex part of edu-
cation. sp grades are replaced by
written faculty reports and con-
sultation with the students. No
grades transcript is produced dur-
ing the college career.

An alternative to regular grad-
ing is in use at Swarthmore where
an honors program for juniors and
seniors provides for a series of
examinations by outside examin-
ers at the end of the freshman
year. At Reed College grades are
kept on file but not given to the
student. a procedure that might
well add to the "grade anxiety"
for many students. The existence
of the experiment attests to
Reeds ambivalent effort to min-
imize grades as a threat to the
student while keeping grades as a
method of evaluation for society.
The California and Massachusetts
Institutes of Technology have both
instituted pass fail for all fresh-
men students in an effort to re-
duce the role of grades.

A number of schools are seek-
ing to minimize the freshman's
sense of being lost to an alien land.
Michigan State University and the
Santa Cruz campus of the Univer-
sity of California have instituted
s;nall. semi-autonomous colleges
complete with commom living fa-
cilities and resident faculty. The
Tussman fexperinIje‘nt at Berkeley‘-

 
     
  

is also a small somewhat detach-
ed college. but it is a single island
in the huge Berkeley campus. An
alternativeto having small groups
is the imposition of a common ex-
perience for all freshmen such as
the freshmen seminars at Beloit
College. Stephen College. Florida
State. and Brooklyn College.

The use of small groups (about I

15) as a base for the freshmen
year has been in use at Antioch
College in Ohio for the past four
years. About one-third of the stu-
dents freshman year experience
centers around this preceptoral
group which includes a faculty
member and a senior. No grades
are given either for the group ac-
tivity or for any regular sched-
uled courses for which the student
may register during the freshman
year. Originally instituted for
three years as an experimental
program. the preceptoral concept
has been retained.

In reviewing the virtures and
faults of the many innovative cur-
ricula. one writer looked with
some dismay at the absence of in-
novation at most of the larger
schools. It seemed a tragedy to
him that a student could not enroll
at a modern multiversity and
there encounter an "Antioch“ or
"Reed" or "Goddard" or any
number of other optionswhich
have seemed most suited to his
emerging needs. It is hoped that
the ASRC proposals will help to
bring that possibility into being.

ECNOMICS or AN
INTENSIVE, SMALL GROUP
FIRST YEAR

The following is an exercise in
crystal ball gazing. It provides a
couple of ways of looking at the
problem. but as in all such efforts
the results depend on the assump-
tions. and the assumptions are
arbitrary. although hopefully de-
fensible.

COSTS

Let us start by assuming that
all entering students will be as-

signed to a small group which is‘. 2 I

the educational nucleus for the
first year. Also each group has

one full time faculty member with
no other responsibilities.

program will depend on: (1) size
of entering class: (2) size of small
group: and (3) average salary of
participating faculty. Reasonable
and workable ranges on these
variables might be as follows: (1)
entering class 1.500-1.750:

faculty salary $10.000-$15,000.
Minimum and maximum cost es-

timates could then be generated 3

by making the appropriate as-
sumptions and are $1 million and
$2.187.500.

_ A reasonable "best" estimate
might be based on the following
assumptions (1) an entering class
of 1.500 which in the View of some
administrators is necessary to
keep the College at a manageable
size: (2) groups of 15 which w'ou__ld
provide sufficient diversityil (3)

an average faculty salary of $12.- L
000 since it is anticipated that a A 3

higher proportion of youngerpro*-
fessors would be interested in

participating. Also new. faculty 2
might be recruited partially on the 

basis of an interest inthis kind of

costs. .

The economic feasibility of a

program cannot be judged with

 

 

cost data only. It is the relation of  

costs to potential revenue that
must—be generated by or allocated
to sucha program._

Revneues

 

Two different methods of de- 

termining the revenues will be
discussed. The first is very sim-

ple and straightforward. Each stu-

dent normally pays tuition and., if

a Pennsylvania resident. the Uni- I

versity receives a subsidy from 2 S A

the state. The sum of these is cur-
rently $1.700. Thus 1.500 students

would generate $2.55().ooo. On the  ' ’

surface one could expect that a

$1.2million program could easily ‘

be financed out of these revenues.
However. if we take an alterna-

I tive approach and start with the

divisional budget allocations in
Table I the results are somewhat
different.

. The estimated distribution of
faculty time is shown in Table 2.
We cn estimate the money spent
on undergraduate instruction by
applying appropriate percentage
in Table 2 to the budgets in Table
1. e.g. for the Humanities 58 per
cent of $3.148.8. On this basis the
total departmental expenditures
on undergraduate teaching is $5.-
985.000. Assuming that one-fourth
of this amount is available for the
entering class we get $1.5 million.
This would cover the faculty costs
of $1.2 million plus $800.000 for

any other direct costs. Since this
calculation is based on depart-
mental budgets. overhead ex-A
penses are presumably already
covered.

While the foregoing estimates
indicate that we could easily fi-
nance a first year small group
program. the actual present allo-
cation of resources is not one
which would permit it. Every
chairman knows that the fresh-
men fill his xread and butter
courses. those with low costs and
high revenues. If we define eco-

nomic exploitation as the differ-
ence between value received and
the amount paid. the freshman in
the College of Arts has to be the
most exploited student at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Thus. of all
budget revenue allocated to un-
dergraduate teaching we can ex-
pect that significantly less than
one-fourth are currently spent on
freshmen. In addition there are
other methods of allocation which
yield less favorable results. Sup-
pose that we allocate faculty ra-
ther than budget to the proposed

program. Table 3 concains the rel-
evant data. Taking the full-time
equivalent faculty by division and
applying the appropriate percen-
tage from Table 2 we get 268 FTE
devoted to undergraduate instruc-
tion. One-fourth of this is 67 which
is only two-thirds of the neces-
sary number for the proposed pro-
gram. While it may bethat aver-
age salary of all faculty is higher
than the $12.000 assumed in our
original cost estimates it cannot
be enough greater to account for
these different results.

Without more refined data V37}

can only conjecture as to the rea-
sons for the discrepancy. How-
ever. one very reasonable conjec-
ture is that nothing like $1.5 mil-
lion is spent educating freshmen.
Consequently. we will be arguing
for a reallocation of resources and
we must make the case strongly

as to why that reallocation is jus-'

tified.

The Moratorium held Satur-
day at Carnegie-Mellon Universi-
ty “brought the war home" as it
concentrated on the general theme
of Political Repression.

Two programs which highlight-
ed the afternoon session were
those on the extermination of the
Black Panthers and Suppression
of Political Views in the Media
and Arts. 6

 At the Panther workshop Claude

Allen. professor at Point Park Col-
lege: Russell Trunzo. staff of Re-
pression Information Service
Committee. and David Owens.
University professor. all spoke on
black repression.

Allen advocated the “taking up
of arms,” because “non-violence
does not work.” In supporting this
statement Allen cited the Poor
People’s March and Dr. Martin
Luther King's assassination. He
further stated that: “38 Black
Panthers have been killed in the
last three years; the government

 is racsist and could not be infil-
Qrated without becoming fascist

pigs (like they are); the only way

to secure political power comes
through the end of a gun, and the
blacks must solidify, join forces
to get rid of the manipulators.”

“A shit storm is coming.“ con-
tinued Russ Trunzo. because any—
thing South of Canda is the South
in this country." He stated that
we must “go into the valley of mis-
ery were our brothers are. "

"We must force this state to
come to a halt. and throw our-
selves into the machinery."

Allen stated that “we must deal
with administrators as lackeys,”
and he parelleled this country with
Hitler’s Germany. Owens accus-
ed the audience of “letting wrongs
go untouched,” and added that
“we all must bring the war
home.”

In conclusion the trio urged that
we "put something on the line . . .
put.our jobs. put our standing on
the line.“ *‘

The dealing with repression.
Charles Robb. editor of the Pitts-
burgh Point, offered a more
peaceful solution. He spoke on
“Repression of Political Views
in the Media and the Arts."

!

“Fuck repression,’ he began,
“and then get on with business.
“Handle a crackdown and get on.”
He further stated that “we must
make society better through our
uses of the media.”

There is harassment of under-
ground papers -- considered ob-
scene or objectional." he went
on. “but the point isn‘t repressed
-— maybe we just aren't doing
enough." He felt that all the ma-
jor newspapers and news stations
only take care of themselves and
"do what is expected of them."

Robb continued with an analy-
sis of one of. what he considered.

Political Repression
Moratorium Theme

the major problems of media re-
pression—selective and biased
coverage of events. “All the peo-
ple must have power." he said.
We must create means. where
people have power. to give the
news how and when they want to.“

"We can do something about the

“because the spirit of the people
is better than technology. But we
have to be linked within other

Cagers Shooting Better, Down PSU

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Anyone who has been watching the Panther cagers this
winter knows that Coach Buzz Ridl waits awhile before he

inserts Cleveland Edwards into the line-up. Saturday night the 5-10
guard was never asked to get off the bench in the second half.

though.

Ridl and Edwards don't have
any personality conflicts or any-
thing like that. The coach just
knew when things were going
good in the Jungle Cat 61-47
triumph over Penn State.

The man Edwards usually re-
places is Bill Downes. last
years Most Valuable Player.
Against the Nittany Lions
Downes was a valuable man.
indeed.

He scored 13 points, his sea-
son high, and shared the Pan-
thers rebounding lead with
six.

His hustle was his best asset.
He grabbed ten of his points on
easy layups which resulted from
his breaking loose under the
basket. He didn't attempt any‘
other type of shot all night.

The junior guard also stole
the ball and intercepted passes
often during the second half
when the Cats pulled away from
the Lions.

“This hustle is Bill’s strong
point,” ‘Ridl said. “It was odd.
I expected to use Cleve as
much as, ifnot more than, him.
But the way Bill played it just
didn’t make sense . . not to
take anything away from Cleve.
I know how good he is.”

quite a few interceptions near
the defending hoop. The for-
ward was also the other cager
with six rebounds. '

Offensively. the two clubs
were just about even at half-
time. The Panthers led. 24-21.
as both teams were playing a
deliberate game with neither
squad attempting more than 21
shots.

The slow pace of the encount-
er might have hurt the Lions
(who were guarding very close-
ly) more than anything else.

“The fact that we move the
ball more than anybody else
they have played against may
have caused them to lose some
of their agressiveness. the stick-
to-the—player style. "Ridl said.
"When you‘re always guarding.

"Panthers. In fact. the cagers
have been playing a spirited
game lately. moving their re-
cord to3-7.’ >

“I think this is helping us
alot." Ridl said. “In practice
we were aggressive. but early
in the season we hesitated.
Now we're taking over and it‘s
hurting the other team."

The Lions suffered Saturday
night. They committed 20 turn-
overs, but “committed” "isn’t
the right word because many
of them were interceptions and
steals by Panthers.

Downes wasn't the only thief.
Mike Patcher came up with

ing the ball from the Lions in
the second half the pace of the
game increased. And the cagers
started to put some points on the
score board.

The Cats’ getaway began about
midway through the final half
when they raised a 38-31 lead to
a 46-31 advantage.

Kent Scott was putting the
ball through the hoops more
often than the whole Lion squad

at that time. He racked up 22‘

points before Ridl removed him
with 1:54 left in the game.

"This is the kind of thing I‘ve
been expecting from Kent." Ridl

There were a few surprise
winners in Saturday’s track
opener with Kent State. but the
final outcome was no surprise as
Jim Banners squad trounced the
Ohioans 64-36.

‘En route to their first dual win
of the indoor season. the thin-
clads captured eight of the
twelve events. set four records
and tied a fifth.

Doug Dagenhart. a freshman
and former ohio state champion.
was responsible for two records
himself. as he vaulted to a 148'
height in the pole vault. Dagen-
hart's mark broke both the exist-
ing varsity and Field House
records. The old varsity record
was 143“ set in 1963. while the
Field House mark of 144" was
set by Seese of Penn State last
year. -

The mile relay team contin-
ued its record breaking perfor-
mances by posting a 3:18.4, the
best in Field House history. The
quartet of Smitty Brown, Carlos
Reisen, Dennis Schatzman and
Dorel Watley also qualified
for the NCAA meet by virtue

. of Saturday’s clocking.

Cubs Drop DU

by BILL NAAB

The Cubs topped the Du-
quesne frosh 88-85, and there-

by dispelled the myth that Al
Bailey‘s Little Dukes are infal-
lible.

Prior to Saturday night. Du-
quesne had only lost one game
in three seasons. This year.
Coach Al Bailey’s club had
rolled over five straight oppon-
ents without defeat.

The Cubs. on the otherhand.
had difficulty ringing-up enough
baskets to knock-off any of their

three previous rivals. At game— .

time. however. all indications
from past history proved negli-
gible.

From the opening moments,

. both clubs backed up 6’8”. Cub

center Bill, Sulkowski’s view-
point that the two squads were
superior freshman teams.

The Cubs led 16-14 after the
initial eight minutes. The re-
mainder of the contest at that
point was .a rugged tug-of-war
between the two sides.

Bill Sulkowski‘s two-point shot
raced the early Cub lead to six
points. 22-16. Minutes later. how-
ever. the Dukes pulled even (24-
24) after Gary Carter sank a
short jump shot.

During the next five minutes,
the Dukes were constantly check-

ed and always trailed by a has-

ket or two.

Then with 3:28 remaining in
the half. the Dukes put their
tanks in high gear and roared
past the winless Cubs.

Jack Wojdowski of Duquesne
swished the ball through the
hoop and the Dukes took com-
mand. 34-33- Wojdowski. fouled
by' Buzz_v Harrison. sank two
free throws which pushed the
Dukes lead to 43-38 at the half.

Throughout the ' second half,
the Cubs made it known that they
weren’t about to permit the Du-
quesne momentum to crush their
victory hopes.

Marvin Abrams and Bill Sul-
kowski opened the half with a
bucket a piece and narrowed
the gap to a point: 43-42. For
the next seven minutes. the

However. the Dukes outscored
the Cubs 12-5 within a three
minute period. and it appeared
that the Cubs might be added
to Duquesne's victory snowball.
With only 6:36 left in the game.
the Cubs trailed 73-64. I

Cub forward Carl Morris, who

along with guard Marvin Abrams
led the scoring, with 24 tallies,
stated that he and his team-
mates
enough throughout the contest.

weren’t jumping hard

"Coach told me to start jump-

ing or we wouldn‘t win. I was-
n‘t playing hard enough at first;

something was on my mind. In

the second half I was deter-

mined to play alot harder." Mor-
ris said.

By the time four minutes re-
mained on the clock. the fiery
Cubs had sliced their deficit to
a point. 75-74. Guard Don Wil-
son put the Cubs within a point
when he stole the ball and scor-
edalayup.

qualify Jerry for the nationals."
Commented Banner. "I didn‘t
‘think Norris would be that strong.
He just got away from us."

new varsity record in the broad
jump but he. like Richey. had to

Wilson and forward Randy
Arnold agreed that the Dukes
were the best team they have

yet to play. Arnold said. “We had

to win. and we beat the best

State freshman Leonard Turner
broke the Field House record
with a leap of 23-412". Turner
also grabbed a first place in the
50-yard dash and tied the Field
House record of 5.3 seconds.

Rounding out the record set-
ting performances. Bryant Sal-
ter tied his Field House mark
of 68‘ in the high jump. Salter
cleared 610',‘ last week at Mary-
land. but he explained that the
short runway in the Field House
cramps his performance.

“I can only get a five-step ,

take-off here in the Field House.
I usually need seven steps.” com-
mented the junior from South
Hills. Salter is shooting at the
seven foot mark and “hopes to
get it at the next meet, and may-
be more.”

The 600-yard run produced
somewhat of an upset as sopho-
more Dorel Watley streaked to
a 1:12 win. Smitty Brown. who
holds both the varsity and Field
House records in the event. got
boxed in on the final turn and

Government Demands A REAL Change

THE QUESTION on most students’ minds this coming election is WHY Student Government (SG)
has failed this past year. Admittedly the most obvious failing of SG is SG itself. It’s structure has
failed to meet the challenges to solve the problems of students and the University. It has very little
legal authority to make or influence University policy or to solve these problems. And in areas of SG
jurisdiction, it does not have the ability or facilities to deal properly with them.

BUT THE QUESTION WE, the Committee for Effective Student Government, ask—“is structure
just the only reason for the failure of SG?” In our minds, the greatest weakness of SG is its leader-

The Committee For EffeetiveStudent   .,

ship, Scott Baum. Of course, he, too, blames the structure of SG for his ineffectiveness. He stead-
fastly claims SG does not work. However, let’ s review the record to see WHY. '

 I PRESIDENT SCOTT BAUM . . . . .

—FAILED TO: advertise and recruit effectively to fill committee
vacancies in SG; ' ‘

——FAILED TO: seek and represent majority student opinion, clean-

ing only to “represent concerned students; 

“ O» -FAILED TO: expel senators who missed three or more SG Sen-

ate meetings and replace them, and fill the vacancies due to
resignation of senators—all of which is required bythe By-
Laws (Section VI, E) and the Constitution (Article VIII, Sec-
tion 6); ‘ - I
—-FAILED TO: fulfill his party’s campaign promises:
a) to solve the parking problem
b) to get sizeable student representation on faculty and ad-
administrative committees
c) to establish plans for the construction of fraternity row
d) to institute an all-university judicial system I
e_) to make SG more relevant and attuned to the student body

V  .—FAILED TO: be responsible for the direction and supervision of

‘ the Cabinet as required by the Constitution.(Article IV, Sec-
tion 3, d5a) ; e

I ——FAILED TO: organize special events effectively, especially

Homecoming as required by the Constitution (Article IV, Sec-
tion 3, d3);
—FAILED TO: nominate any students to become members of the

University Review Board as required by the Constitution (Ar-
ticle VVI, Section 2b).;

O —FAILED TO: offer leadership for all students.

TO ADD TO this gross misconduct and irresponsibility of the pres-
ident, the Senate and whole of‘SG has failed because of its people-
the same people who now say SG should be abolished. To prove this
failure, we let the record of SG speak for itself:

1. The present composition of SG Senate is not representative;
i.e., no blacks.

2.

10.

The records of Senate meetings (the minutes and attendance)
have not been taken since March 26, 1969, as is required by the

Senate Procedure Bill SGUP-B-14, which was passed October

25, 1967.

. Attendance by the Senatorsihas been very poor. Out of seven

meetings between Oct. 16 to Nov. 12, only two meetings had a
quorum. But no record was taken of the guilty senators who
were absent for three or more meetings; so they could not be
expelled or punished as required by the By-Laws (Article VI,
Section E), while Senator Harris Miller sat back and did not
enforce the Constitution. '

. Vacancies in the /Senate due to resignation have not been filled

by the Senate as requiredby the Constitution (Article VIII, Sec-
tion 6, Vacancies). ’

The Cabinet has failed to meet.

The President’s Council has met only once in the spring of ’69,
and since then has not been called to meet again as required by
the Constitution to meet at least twice a month (Article V, Sec-
tion 2, Meetings),

. The,General Assembly has failed to meet and has not been
called to meet as required by the Constitution to meet at least,

once during each of the -fall“ and winter trimesters (Article VI,
Section 4, Meetings).

. The Committee on Student Organizations has not effectively re-

viewed and eliminated unnecessary organizations who assume
a disproportionate amount of the student activities money, as
was promised by its chairman, Harris Miller, who is also an
SG Senator.

. The Allocations Committee increased the activity fees rate

from $6 to $8 this term without the approval of the SG ‘Senate
or the‘Students through a referendum. ’

The Senate has“ been irresponsible in considering the budget be-
cause they allowed Allocations Committee to railroad its bud-
get for approval, and it also discussed and decided on the bud-
get in the Summer Term when the majority ‘of students were

not present to protect and represent their interests.

NOW TO ADD tothe total irresponsibility of SG, if you review the record you will find that Scott
Baum violated Constitutional law eight times even after he swore to “fulfill the responsibilities giv-,

en me the Constitution of SG.” (Article IV, Section 3, b2.) Also, the members of SG violated the 4

provisions of the Constitution another 15 times. Maybe, though, no one on SG has read the Constitu-
tion . . . . . '

WHY WASN’T THIS record of SG known to us during the last year? The most obvious reason is that

the Pitt News didn’t cover SG activities, except to let Scott Baum claim that SG tied his hands, in- «
stead of showing how he tied the hands of SG, “behind our backs.” And who was mainly responsible

for Baum being elected anyway‘? The “Pitt Tabloid,” of course. ~

SO IT ALMOST seems that some people are deliberately sabotaging SG just to make the point that
SG does not work. Shep Goldberg, Harris Miller, Mike Fabricant, Dave Tiernan, and Scott Baum all
claim SG doesn’t work. But they and others were part of the old SG. They were part of the clique who
in the past year has failed with SG. They were responsible’ for SG and other student organizations.
What did they do to change things?

BUT WE, THE Committee for Effective Student Government, will admit with these people that SG
doesn’t work. Though anyone after reading the record doesn’t have to think too long to understand

why. It’s because the President and most of the senators do not work. So why follow them and listen .4

to their ways of solving the problem. They proved already that they couldn’t make SG effective by
their own work or by their demonstrated lack of it. They proved also they could not represent or
lead students in the present system. Then how do they possibly expect they can make any new form
of student representation work? They can’t. But we think there is a candidate for SG president who
can. ‘

STEVE CUNDRA, running on the United Student Coalition ticket, has come up with new ideas and
solutions to student problems, and he will bring new enthusiasm into SG. Being he represents a coal-
ition party, he can bring newunity to the student body. We, as students, can no longer be divided. His
ticket promises to unite all students—conservative, moderate, liberal, black and white. No longer
will the narrow views undermine studentrepresentation. And this unity will make SG effective.

WE FEEL NOW is the time for a change—a real change in SG. So now is your chance to demand this
change. We urge the election of Steve Cundra for SG president and the United Student Coalitionto
change leadership and, change SG structure.
