Union Renovation Cost

by LINDA SAVAGE »

On Tuesday the Student Affairs Advisory Council received the first
positive reaction to recent attempts toward renovation of the Student

L’ nion.

Dean of Student Affairs Dr. Alfred Moye received a letter from
Chancellor Wesley Posvar requesting that a commission of engineers.
students. faculty, administrators’ and others be established to deter-
mine an estimate of the cost of renovating the Student Union.

‘According to Dave Bluey, chairman of the New Student Union Task
Force, which was established_/ this summer specifically for the project,
this is the first time such a commission has been authorized. Bluey
specualted that plans for the completion of the project appear favor-

~ able.

Bluey explained that the renovations under consideration will make
the Student Union more of a recreation center where dorm students
commuters. and faculty can come to interact. Bluey added that he
would like to see bowling alle_vs and a large auditorium included in the
plans. "We would like to see something. going onall the time." he said.

The long range plan will take several years to complete. but ac-

cording to Bluey $100.000 has been allotted for some initial remodeling '

next year. This money will be used to alter the mainfloor.

Plans were also discussed at the council meeting for organizing a
committee to work on converting Bimbo‘s. on the corner of South Bou-
quet St. and Sennott St.. into a student coffee house. The building
was given to the University by Oakland Development Incorporated and

has not yet been put to use. '

Bluey stated that it would be-an inexpensive place for students to
go and if any profit was realized it could be used for further renova-
tions or other Student Government activities. »

ed that MCNR be renamed to honor

the Kennedy assassination) Wecht,
a graduate of Pitt Medical School,
proceeded immediately to give
an account of the murder from a
“hard, physical aspect.”

I John F. Kennedy had been warn-
ed against going to Dallas. "a see-
thing cesspool of hate." in Nov-
ember, 1963. according‘to Wecht.
The major Dallas newspapers
carried a full page statement the
day befoije he was to arrivel ex-
pressing their displeasure with
his visit.

He was shot in his motorcade
limousine near midday—"no one
really knows how many shots
were fired.“ Although his death
was not pronounced by the doc-
tors there until 1:05. the Presi-
dent was dead on arrival at Dal-
las‘ Parkland Hospital a short
time after he was shot. They dis-
covered two wounds. the one "in-
compatible with life“ in the brain.
and another in the neck. Wecht
added. ’

There was a dispute between
the Dallas police and Federal

Police   Appreliend Shooting Suspect 

Two Weapons Contiscatecl

On Tuesday night at approxi-
mately 10 o'clock. a man was shot

with a rifle and severly wounded _

at the corner of Forbes and Mey-
ran Aves. in Oakland. Both Pitts-
burgh city police and campus.po—
lice from the University were on
the scene. The reason for the
shooting has notlyet been deter-
mined. and the victim is hospital-
ized in serious condition. '

According to the official polce
report logged at Police Station NO.
4. theman standing on the corner
was shot yzith .a 30 caliber car-
bine. The assailant fired the rifle
from a moving car. Almost. as
soon as the shots were fired. a
cruising patrol car from Staton 4
observed the car speeding away
from the" scene and began the
chase.

General Studies Deadline Strict

by KARL BALDYS

Students in the School of General
Studies tSGSi who fail to pay their
academic invoice before ‘Dec. 14
will automatically have their win-
ter registration cancelled. The ad-
ministration of the school claims
that the procedure is necessary
to free class spaces tied up by stu-
dents who register for courses
and fail to pay for them. thus lock-
ing out other students when space
is really available. '

According to Hegis Meenihan.
Student Relations coordinator of
SGS. all students will be notified
of this policy through the invoice
itself. a special letter trom'the
dean. and a special warning letter
before the 14th. Students who re-
ceive scholarships or financial aid
of any kindﬂveterans‘ benefitsi

and will be" unable to pay by the
' 14th must arrangea payment de-~ I

debt

In a letter to the student body of
SGS, Dean J. Steele Gow put the
problem this way: “A major prob-
lem we are encountering is an,ex-
tremely high number of students
who register but do not pay their
invoices. This results in class
space being reserved prior to the
start of the term but not actually
utilized which prevents others
from obtaining needed courses.
We want to eliminate this condi-

, tion, except where circumstances

warrant deferment of payment.”

In a Wednesday afternoon con-
ference. Regis Meenihan: James

Student Accounts: Daniel Obara.

on to explain that if a student

Jack Hayes and George Sell
were present on behalf of the‘ Vet-
erans at Pitt. They questioned the

_new procedure but were assured

that all veterans who were eligi-

ble for aid would receive deferred ’

Obara added that  . . the pro-
cedure is not meant to be punitive.
but rather to make things more
efficient." Meenihan felt that SOS

agents in Dallas about where the
autopsy "should be performed,
Wecht revealed. Legally, an auto-
psy is to be done in the city where
homicide occurs, but by 8 that
night, the President's body was
in the Bethesda Naval Hospital in
Bethesda, Md., prepared for an
autopsy. -

When the subsequent ‘govern-
ment investigation and reports
about the nature of the assassina-
tion are comparedto information
"pulled and clawed out by many
private‘ citizens over many
years." a disquieting series of
questions arises.

Of the three doctors chosen to

do the autopsy at Bethesda. all“

were military and two had had no
previous experience in forensic
pathology. the medical science
dealing with this kind of situation.
Present at the actual autopsy. "a
military venture by non.-medical
militarists,“ were a group of ad-
mirals and generals—a strange
group to be present at a purely‘
medical objective investigation.

The city police massd from all
directions to‘liloék the escape of
the attacker. Road blocks were
set up, but the-suspect, once trap-
ped tried to drive through the city

police who at thatvpoint shot out '

his tires. The suspect did not re-
turn the gunfire and he was ar-
rested without further loodshed.

so Now Working Out 
Optional Meal Plans

by LOIS ELDER _
There is a strong possibility that an optional meal plan will be of
lered to dorm students next fall term. according to Tom Bailey. Stu

dent Government president.

"An alternative that were considering to buying a meal‘ticket in
allowing students to buy a card or some sort of ticket worth $200. 'l’;hi
way then can go to the cafeteria and buy, for example; $2 worth of food’.
and have $2 punched out on their card or ticket,” Bailey siad. , A ‘

“If a student decides to go to a restaurant, he won’t lose: money by 7.
not using his meal ticket. He wouldn’t have to pay for a meal he doesn"
eat at the cafeteria plus having to pay for another meal somewhere‘ -

else.” 3

Bailey pointed out hazards that an optional meal plan would create}
"Students might try cooking in their rooms. In Holland Hall this could:
be dangerous because the electrical wiring isn't set up to take hot plates_j
or refrigerators.’ This would probably necessitate strictly enforced
cooking rules because‘ of the fire hazard. 

"Another hazard is that parents might fear their kids are eating}

;\lcDonald‘s or Winky’s every day.

“Also, Carnegie-Mellon is on an optional meal plan, and'I’ve heard‘ 1.-
there are rats in the dorms because students store food in their closetsﬂ.

"We're still deciding what to do about these possible hazards.” ,

An advantage of the optional meal plan is that fewer students"
would be using the cafeteria. and as‘ a result, the quality of the food,
wolild improve._ according to Bailey. "At least.

told." he said. '

s “We should know by Jan. 15 the type of meal plan we’ll be using for

the fall term. The administration has been tremendous in considering
new plans. It has researched about 150 schools currently operating on ;
optional meal plans. West Virginia has a ton of plans, as does Syracuse.

“We have 1,000 names on a petition calling for a referendum on
having an optional meal plan. I know the result will be that we vote for.

Said Rose, “New technological
development is avoided by capital-
ists because it has the potential
to destroy the worth of their pre-
sent investment.” For that reason,
Rose concluded that the oil
industry and the moneyed power
behind it was purposely delaying
the research on fusion reactors,
which Rose claimed, would solve
the energy problems for the world
for “one billion years.”

Rose stated flatly, “Zero growth
rejects the possibilities of science
for the human race.“ He also said
that the country was “moving into
a depression" where the only
hope for the “capitalists" was
the reduction of the working class
which to them waslconsidered only
in dollars and cents. He legiti-
mates the existence of groups like

groups to a "parochial view . . .
people look at their own neighbor-
hoods. and when they see a
housing shortage they think, too
many people." H

Moore began his attack by
contending that "ZPG is not a
part of any ideology. capital-
ist. communist, socialist, fascist.
or whatever. There are little to
the demands we can put on the
world eco-system. " He also
argued with the basic ideas of
technologyaccommodating popu-
lation growth. "The present popu-
lation problem is not the result

of technology but rather the re- ’

sult of death control through inedi-
cine and public health measures."

Moore pointed to the geometric

progression of population in the ‘

world. “In Ceylon the popula-
tion doubles every 29 years and
this economically deprived na-
tion cannot cope with its present
level of deprivation, much less
double the strength of its econo-
my to maintain the status quo.”
He quoted world populations into
the 21st century that_ depict a

_ world of 5 billion persons.

'.‘Labor is not enough," Moore
added, "There have to be capital
investments to increase needed
consumables—and that brings the
problem of pollution up.” He
concluded, "When growth no
longer serves life. we have the
ideology of a cancer cell that
will only destroy."

Hiller then addressed himself
to the issues. "The population
doesn't have to increase for the
economy to prosper." he said. "A
slower rate of growth isinot only
desirable, it‘s necessary.”
quoted figures that would give
the U. S. a population of 1
billion persons by 2150.

I Coroner Wecht Views JFK Assassination

(Continued from Page I)

the Parkland surgeons had only
enlarged the wound for medical
reasons. The official government
statement that followed now said
that the neck wound was the exit
point for the wound in the back.
and the bullet-falling-out theory
was dropped. a

Given the angle of assassin, Lee
Harvey Oswald’s position above
the motorcade, for the bullet to
travel upward through the back
and exit through the neck would
be physically impossible, accord-
ing to the Coroner. Nevertheless,
the statement and theory stood.

Some time after the autopsy,
Wecht said, a group of doctors,
specialists, and scientists review-
ing a film taken of the assassina-
tion by a Dallas businessman dis-
covered that with the type of rifle
Oswald‘ was allegedly using, it was
physically impossible for one man
to fire even the minimum number
of shots that had been _accounted
for. Again the story changed.

This time the officials refuted
their previous statement and
came up with the single bullet
theory, or ‘what Wecht called.
“Magic Bullet Theory.“ The the-
ory held that one bullet. the one
found by the janitor on the stretch-
er. had entered the President's
back, exited through his neck, en-
tered Governor of Texas Connal-
ly‘s right side, exited and travel-
led through his right wrist, enter-
ed his thigh, and ended up on the
stretcher, shiny and with only one
per cent of its original substance
missing."

In a court inquiry in 1969, Wecht
cliams that government officials
refused any cross-examination
about this “scientifically unten-
able and impossible’.’ explana-

tion, and essentially barred the
subject from any further ques-
tioning. This is where the official
statement now stands.

In the course of his address.
Wecht went on to raise countless
other questions about Oswald, the
Dallas police force. the mysteri-
ous dissappearance of Kennedys
preserved brain, and the govern-
ment agencies doing all of the "in-
vestigating.“ As he put it. the as-
sassination and the events sur-
rounding it still remain "a spooky
matter."

Wecht first became involved
with Kennedy‘s assas-sination
when the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences asked him to
prepare a paper on it in 1965. “One
thing led to another,” and he has
been immersed in the -matter
since then.

ly. His own belief is that there was
a definite conspiracy to murder
Kennedy which had contacts in

key government positions, and

that at the actual assassination.
there were two gunmen. He feels
that if this could be proven, the
matter would be opened up to in-
vestigation again and the real
events of Nov. 22, 1963, might be
uncovered.

About the possibility of this hap-
pening, however, Wecht said it

Professor Schempp admits that “there is no
,ubt that the fertilized ovum and fetus are alive”
 that cellular material genetically identifies
em‘ as part of our species. He also says, “Every
lllof the body is ‘human’ to this degree, each con-
ifiis‘ the genetic code unique to the individual and
éefsith every injury many of these cells are killed.”
«therefore we agree on genetics, but hardly on “be-

‘g’-’ or ontology. I

. Ontologically, there are some who think that

e human being comes from a zygote, or from the

ique union of an ovum and a sperm. More ac-

ii:at-e it is to think, however, that the human per-

ii and zygote are synonymous. Instead of stating

‘capacity for loving and thinking (by which to solve
calculus or have morals). And the human zygote
could not truly possess such undeveloped capabil-
ities unless he (or .she) actually is the being that
"has" such capacities. Just as it is undoubtedly
correct that only a human being has the "develop-
ed" capacities for loving and thinking; it should be
clearly true that only a human being can have the
“developed” ' capacities for loving and thinking
(human rationality). The one-celled gorilla. cat. or

ram has no such undeveloped capabilities; thus.

they .have no such developed capacities. The one-
celled gorilla, for example, is qualitatively differ-
entiated from the one-celled human. not only in gen-
etic structure. but much more basically in the very
"being“ that."has“ a particular genetic structure.

The value and dignity of the human being is not
determinable simply on the basis on what he actual-
ly has, but founded on the basis of what he truly is.
The value of the person is not essentially in his ac-
tualities that have matured, but most being fully in
the actuality of what he is. And his being constantly
“has’ undeveloped potential, no matter how long
and active his life on earth may be.

“The principle of the sanctity of human life
respect and tolerance toward the lives of others.
and thus, hopefully, in reciprocity toward our-
selves,” says Professor Schempp. He then goes on
to propound an ethic based upon “reductio ad ab-

certain qualities such as self-awareness. sensory
detection, love, and social interaction. 'l‘here-
fore, if we go to sleep, fall _unconscious, loose our

necessarily have no precise answer. . . . We might
adopt quite arbitrarily the time 10 days after birth

I The Sad

Plight of

The Meter Maid r  

by HARTZ M. GRAVEL

Here at t_he University. where
diversity of opinion is highly
thought of if not always practiced.
there is one area of almost mira-
culous unanimity. With few excep-
tions land they probably don't
drive) the University community
is convinced that meter maids are
out to get them.

In the popular imagery the me-
ter maid, is often muscular. al-
ways vicious. and generally fleet
of foot. She is sometimes credit-
ed with a nearly supernatural
memory, capable of iecallirg in
excruciating detail exactly which
meter is about to expire at any
given minute of the day. It is wide-
ly suggested that she takes an odd
psychosexual delight in issuing
tickets. I

These slanderous allegations
may very well be true, but they
are not the whole story.

Consider for a moment the sad
plight of the meter maid. Her title
obliges her to be not only single
but resolutely virginal as well.
regardless of her own age or in-

'clinations. She is constantly ex-

posed to the elements in a uniform
that looks like it was designed by
the city highway department. And
she must walk.

All day, every day, she must
walk the streets of an ungrateful
city, whatever the weather. no
matter how tired she may be. It
would be no cause for wonder if
she occassionally grew resentful
and envious of those who own. and
drive, and park, automobiles.

She must walk all day, every
day, in the broiling heat ofgsum-
mer, through the gray snow banks
of metropolitan winter; through
the moldering leaves in the gut-
ters of autumn and the simpering
partly cloudiness of spring. All
day long she must trudge the

And she must know that law. in-
timately. and enforce it. strictly
but fairly.

_As has been stated, her only
respite from walking occurs when
she is obliged to ticket a maletac-
tor. Dyspodia (sore feet) is one
of' the most painful ills this all too
fragile flesh is heir to. When com-
bined with writers cramp, the
total effect is better imagined
than experienced. and might per-
haps best be ignored.

All this is very well, you may
hear yourself saying, but what
can we the ‘public do to alleviate
the suffering of the meter maid?

Very little. I fear.

If we scrupulously obey the very
letter of the law as regards park-
ing we may better her lot for" the
short term but the ultimate con-

sequence of such acticn would be
to deprive her of her already "pre-
carious livelihood. It is a harsh
but accurate observation that
while quotas as such are not as-
signed. books of ticket stubs are
the only evidence the beleaguered
meter maid can present to her su-
periors ta group of sinister men)
to prove that she has done her
duty and not spent the afternoon

wallowing in some low saloon.‘

Zrust is caught up with the "ne-

suppose this is a typical example

by JOHN METCALFE

Lately, Zero Population Growth has been draw-
ing flak from people they might once have assumed
were their natural allies. Other organizations with
goals related to the limitation of population before
we crowd ourselves out ofexistence get some at-
tention. but ZPG seems to attract the most virulent
criticism. ‘

It is currently fashionableto accuse them of ra-
cism and genocide, separately or in combination.

What they have done to deserve this treatment
hardly seems criminal. They have advised people
who can not afford to support the children they al-
ready have on methods for the avoidance of further
pregnancies. Some of the people they’ advised were
black or Spanish surnamed. ' '

_In addition, ZPG is on record as feeling that the
world is at least crowded enough now; while a re-
duction in total population is most unlikely, they
would like it to stabilize near current levels.

I still don't detect any genocide. If there is any
racism at work here, I can't tell which color
scheme it favors and which it threatens. I begin to

suspect we are hearing yet another example of

"rhetoric. ”

  A cm...

and a Half A

“Rhetoric,” when properly capitalized and set
off in quotation ,marks, is a technical term. To state-
ments and actions which would probably be legally
actionable if uttered or performed by someone
whose color scheme is not the same as yours.

The logic behind these bizarre accusations of
genocide znd racism may seem difficult to detect.
It is necessary to invent a new inalienable and sa-
cred right—the right of every minority to breed it-
self into a majority. It may take a while to get used
to the idea. Be patient.

At that point. of course, the former majority
will have become a minority itself, inherited the sa-
credright, and begun the process all over. Neat.

In point of fact, ZPG and related groups have
had their most conspicuous success among edu-
cated, middle-class whites. It has been suggested
that the children of white suburbanite college ‘grad-
uated constitute a new endangered species.

I am inclined to wonder about the lives of those
who are shrillest in denouncing ZPG. I would dearly
love to know whether they are defending their own
personal right to unlimited numbers of hungry chil-
dren, or are just playing with an abstraction they in-
vented to while away dull afternoon of waiting for
the revolution.

The basic story is concerned
with the design and construction
of the Brooklyn Bridge in the late
19th century. A great deal of its
suspense will be lost on those
readers who are familiar with
New York, Brooklyn, or both, and
know how it came out, but Mr.
McCullough manages to make his
curious subject interesting and
even exciting for the ordinary
reader. No special knowledge of
engineering or of bridges is need-
ed.

The back of the book is full of
appendices, long lists of aston-
ishing figures, references, notes
and an‘ extravagantly compreh-
hensive index, all organized to
make sense to the layman..

The heart of the book. though,
and the reason it is such a worth-
while and interesting work, is the
personal story of the Roeblings,
father and son, engineers both,
who conceived and then built the
Great Bridge. John Roebling, the
father, came to this country from
Saxony, Germany, and settled in
the Pittsburgh area. He founded
the town of Saxonburg just north
of here, went on to dominate the
wire-rope and steel cable indus-
tries (more interesting than it
may sound) and finally designed

a series of bridges. All of them
were dramatic and technically
difficult, but the Brooklyn takes
all the superlatives.

His son, Washington, who even-
tually built the Great Bridge,
spent part of his early career in
Pittsburgh. Among other things,
he persuaded a canal to pass high
over the Allegheny river near
downtown. His flume was the only
one of its kind, and was generally
considered amazing.

So much for local interest. At
the bridge itself, the careful read-
er will see the notorious and the
famous of the era slinking and
striding, respectively, in the
neighborhood of the Great Bridge.
The plot is straight forward, and
the attention of detail is marvel-
ous.

One quibble, though. Facts are
the substance of this book;ia total
of once McCullough slips a trifle,
referring to "millions of tons of
masonry” in the bridge towers.
Even using generous estimates of
the masses of material involved it
is difficult to get a total much
over a single million tons. That is
probably enough to impress most
of us anyway.

sss SEI.l. sss

WE WILL TRY TO MAKE AN OFFER
ON EVERY BOOK BROUGHT IN.

I hesitate to recommend any
student to rush out and purchase
The Great Bridge. Elc ven dollars
is a lot of money, even for a book
as fine as this one.

However, if you have any rela-
tives who like to get specific hints
at this joyous season of the year,
it may not be too 1a'e to suggest
that they surprise you with The
Great Brdige.

for some time. He was surprised
that. to date. student reaction was
minimal.

Beavers emphasized. "This is
a test." If the new code does not
cause too many problems and
proves itself to be more efficient.
other schools might adopt a simi-
lar policy in regard to invoicing.

Sell seemed to feel that SGS is
too often the testing ground for
such administrative maneuvers.
He asked, “Why is General

Studies being experimented with
by University administrators?”

Meenihan emphasized that the
decision was made entirely by the
staff of the SGS and that although
other schools will certainly be
watching. it was not his intention
to make SGS students guinea pigs.

Beavers expressed his hope that
the program would be a success.
stating that “the University is los-
ing, in all schools, between 5.000-
6000 class spaces. and that hurts
the students.

Teaches Orientation Techniques s

by KAREN BURGIO

A questionnaire was recently
distributed by the office of resi-
dence life to all resident students
concerning ideas for students with
similar interests for living together
‘in University dorms.

According to M2 rian Hirst.
Coordinator of Residence Life.
the idea of grouping resident stu-

dents by special interests is not --

a new one. She stressed that stu-
dents. if they so desired, would be
grouped by common interest, not
by common majors. This life
style would present a living and
learning experience for students.

Wahl explained that “the co'urse’s
purpose is to better prepare the
Mentor to help in orienting new

students , to the University,
combined with the traditional
training workshop in April to

establish the Mentor as compe-
tent and reliable resource for the
student. In addition. it should
help us in our attempt to shift
the emphasis of the Orientation

cial to an educational program."

the Orientation and Mentor Pro-
gram for the past year, is the de-

Channukah Celebrates

Religious Freedom

SHULAMIT I. BASTACKY

Channukah is one of many
holidays celebrated during the
Jewish year. It begins with the
25th day of the Hebrew month
Kislev. which this year came on
Decemberlst. The festival com-
memorates great events in the
history of the Jewish people'-
the revolt and victory of small
groups of Israelites led by the
brave Maccabees. It commemor-
ates the struggle for religious
liberty, against the vast army of
Syrian oppressors under the
leadership of Antiochus, which
culminated in the recapture of
Jerusalem and the rededication
of the Holy Temple (165 B.C.E.)
On the 25th of month Kislev the
Temple was consecrated anew

to the service of God, and lasts‘

for 8 days, because the ceremony
of rededication and festivities
continued for that length of time.
This holy day is also called
the Feast of Lights or Illumin-
ation.'It is customary to kindle
the Channukah lamp throughout
the 8 days of the festival. One

light is kindled on the first night,
and an additional one is lit on
each succeeding evening until
the last day, when 8 candles
are burned. The custom of kind-
ling the lights finds its origin
in a miracle which is said to
have occured during the rededi-

cation of the Temple. When the.

perpetual/zlamp was about to be
lit, there was found only one
cruse containing sufficient un-
defiled oil for one day, but by a
miracle it lasted for 8 days, the
time required for the prepara-

tioh of fresh oil. The first his-~

torian to speak of kindling was
Josephus Flavius.

Traditionally after the kind-
ling of the light, the family
gathers around the table. It is
customary to eat a goose stuffed
with dumplings. The special
treat is potato pudding, but it is
regarded as specially meritor-
ious to eat pancakes made of
cheese and other cheese delica-

cies. Family, relatives, friends

and neighbors gather ‘together.-

All of these are misconceptions,

more dynamically. He defines TM
as “a proven technique which
allows the individual to system-
atically enjoy increasingly re-
fined states of awareness until its
pure state, the field of pure intel-
ligence is reached.”

According to Allon, the by—pro-
ducts of TM are numerous and
broad. These include an increas-
ed resistance to daily stresses,
increased clarity of mind, and
"greater happiness." Two twenty-
minute sessions of TM daily
seem to optimize these preten-
tious results.

Not so subjectively stated are
the physiological effects, which
are none the less impressive. The
results of various studies have ap-
peared in such respected publi-
cations as the Scientific American

‘and The New England Journal of

Medicine, and others..One inter-
esting result shows that oxygen
consumption during meditation
drops far below the level reached
during sleep, indicating a very
deep state of rest. Also decreased

' are changes in cardiac output.

breathing rate, and galvanic skin
responses. These are the three~.in-
dicators used to show emotional
disturbances during most poly-
graph (lie . detector) tests.
Studies have also been made which
show increased learning ability

and reduced reaction time among

TM practitioners when compared
to non—m"editators.

known, even to students of dance.

The technique was developed

, 1_e studying in’ Haiti. She be-

She used these dances to develop

Robert K. Wallace of UCLA sur-
veyed 1,862 meditators and found
that prior to starting TM, 80 per-
cent had used marijuana, and
48 percent had used LSD or sim-
ilar drugs. After practicing TM
for 21 months, only 12 percent
were still using marijuana, and
fewer than 4 percent were taking
hallucinogens. Virtually all of these
people considered TM “very im-

portant” in stopping or decreas- .

ing their use of drugs. The accom-
panying chart displays the results
of a similar study by the Stan-
ford Research Institute.

Such results are obvious reasons
for the high level of student
interest in TM. Integral in the
technique’s appeal to others
(and TM practicioners range from
businessmen to housewives to
rock stars) as its "natural" make-

up. TM apparently requires no.

concentration and little, effort.
Also important is the lack of

ideological or sociological dress-

ing accompanying the process.
There is no special lifestyle which
meditators must assume. As John
Allon states, "There are no do‘s
and don’ts with transcerdental
meditation. 7'

Allon is ‘a salaried reprenta—
tive of the Student International
Meditation Society‘(SIMS).» This
is a non-profit organization with
coordinating centers in fifteen
cities nationwide. Along with
disseminating information, SIMS’
main function is the instruction
of new meditators in the tech-
nique.

RESULTS OF A study by the Stanford Research Institute on the use of g

drugs by TM students‘,

Most meditators follow an in-
structional program which be-
gins with two introductory lec-
tures. The first of these is, gen-
erally a description of meditation,
its effects and its history. In the
second lecture, a somewhat more
specific (discussion of the tech-
nique is presented. '

The instruction really begins
when the potential meditator takes
the first of four two-hour teach-
ing sessions with a trained in-
structor of TM. These instructors
have been trained in a four-
month-long course taught by Ma-
harishi Mahesh Yogi, of Beatles
and Mia Farrow fame. Follow-
up sessions with the instructors
are usually heldgto make sure the
persons are still meditating pro-
perly. The reason for this, ex-
plainsqAllon, is to assure that it
remains easy to do, so the person
gains maximum benefit from the
activity. Since- TM apparently
yields some immediate, noticable
results there is a very low-drop-
out rate among those completing
the course.

There is a fee for the individu-
al instruction—-$35 for High School
students, $45 for College students,
and $75 for working adults. The
money pays the salary of teachers
like Allon and‘ defrays the oper-
ating costs of SIMS. There are
only 2,000 such instructors in
this country, and this is the ma-

: jor deterrent tofaster growth of

T.M. -

‘The individual instruction is

;_ apparently necessary because of
' the personalized nature of TM.

According to Allon, the tech-

I

nique is not something which
could be presented through the
mass media in any way.

This is obviously why SIMS
literature and Mr. Allon" are
loaded with general definitions
of TM. and descriptions of its
effects, but are very reluctant to
discuss the tmechanics of the
technique. Unfortunately, this
leads some people to skepticism
regarding the altruism of SIMS
and its representatives.

There is less room for skep-
ticism regarding the validity of
the process itself. There are signs
of TMs acceptance‘in areas of
the “establishment” other than the
scientific community. Crminial
corrections authorities in Van-
couver, B.C., and La Tuna, Texas
are experimenting with TM as
an aid to helping inmates to-
ward rehabilitation. Credit
courses in TM or SCI—the Science
of Creative Intelligence. are be-
ing offered at Yale, Stanford. the
University ‘of Colorado, and
Cal. at Sacramento and Berkeley.

At a time when it appears that
the extent of man’s progress will
be determined by the amount
of stress he can withstand, rather
than the limits of his construc-
tive abilities, transcendental medi-
tation could possible provide an
extension of both, and eventually
benefit us all.

Ralph Dean, an inveterate skep-
tic will begin transcendental
meditationsoon; both to satisfy
his own doubts and to possibly
reduce “a growing list of dis-
gustingly enjoyable vices.”
report on the validity of the tech-
nique will appear next term.

Design

Sessions Considered

. by LARRY PANSINO

Q."-‘L Dale Allerton. the Director of the Summer Sessions. recently
' explained the role of his office and plans he has formulated for it.
7;"Our function is to help plan the most effective use of the summer
7.;program.'' he said. "We hope to influence department chairmen as
to which courses are to be offered and make suggestions to the Dean.
"However, I am not a director. just a co-ordinator: I advise. cajole.
recommend. and prod. I have no budgetary powers.

. “Traditionally, the summer months are a lucrative time for most
‘universities. One of our objectixes is to me ke money f(f the school
by getting courses which are not in demand removed and replaced
by more ;nnovative ones. Generall_v. I hope to design a market
5}.’ model for summer courses, contrasted b_v academic balance to
if determine the most feasible plan for what classes will be offered.”

. I Another duty of Allerton’s office is to recruit students for the
» summer session—both transient (non-Pitt) students and those present-
L ly enrolled in a degree program here. To solicit students from other
—V institutions, ‘he will distribute a bulletin in handbook form to other
schools and to any students wm ask for such information. A separate
brochure will be mailed to all Pilt undergraduates in the College of
 Arts and Sciences, General Studies, and Education to encourage sum-
“mer sessions enrollments. Allerton’s office will handle the transient
. fstudent registrations; all Pitt students interested in the program must
register through their regtlar academic advisor_and the registration
office. .

, The recruitment of summer studentsiis necessitated by low
‘ enrollments. Allerton pointed out that many students attend spring
- session‘ but leave the summer open for jobs and vacations. He would
“like ‘-‘a more even use of the physical plant" of the University.

, _ Allerton is planning to work for new courses directed at appeal-
Ving to three student groups——women, educators and quality high
»~ -school students. He feels that a high schoolers could use the ex-
 perience of attending a large urban university for several weeks in
 inakingplans for his undergraduate work. ‘

  
  

    
  
   
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
 

 

Young Lawyers Seek Reduction

In

Penalty tor Private Pot Use

Pittsburgh AP— The Young
Lawye.rs Section. of the Alle-
gheny County Bar Association
has recommended that posses-
sion and distribution in ‘private
of small amounts of marijuana no
longer be punishable as a crim-
inal offense. _

The committee. which said it

represents about one—third of the

bar association’s members, sup-
ported its stand by citing reports

from the National Commission
on Marijuana and Drug Abuse
and the National Institute of
Health that marijuana is not a
serious threat to health.

A statement issued by the group
also said it believed prohibiting
the private use .of marijuana
breeds disrespect for the law
"among the millions of Ameri-
Caf1S._Wh0 regularly smoke mari-
juana and who. although theyare

otherwise law abiding citizens,

just do not believe it is harm—f——

ful.”

The committee also said it feels
enforcement of marijuana laws
diverts the needed money and
personnel from the enforcement
of laws governing more serious,
violent and organized crime. The
young lawyers‘ position was re-
jected by the bar associations

‘Deserve More Acclaim’

by BARBARA GERAUD '
Rock Critic

Somehow, Bread has never gc tten the recogrition they deserve.
Their constant stream of AM radio hits has most critics dismissing
them as something less than fantastic.

But they don’t pretend to be a "heavy" group. No songs full of hid-
den symbolism, no 25-minute jam sessions. no special effects drown-
ing out the vocals. Just an awful lot of good music.

This is especially evident on their new album, Guitar Man (Elek-
tra EKS-75047). Starting out with David Gates’ “Welcome to the Mu-
sic,” a rockin’ ‘introduction and semi-autobiographical recounting of
Bread’s past year, they run through a dozen of the nicest rock songs
I’ve heard in many a year._

David Gates still bears the brunt of the songwriting chores. and

he’s come up with some rather varied ones this time around.—there‘s

’ "Guitar Man,” of course, featuring keyboardist Larry Knechtel (he’s

the one who played the piano on "Bridge Over Troubled Water") on

guitar for a change. There’s “Tecolote.” a sort of reggae-type number

-«about a voodoo mother. And the group’s latest single, "Sweet Surren-
der,” is also included. I

The rest of the songs were written by the other members of the
group, with two by James Griffin and Robb Royer, who won an Aca-
demy Award for ‘For All We Know," and a very beautiful "Picture in
Your Mind" by Larry Knechtel. They all add up to a most enjoyable

V album, and one worth having.

* * ‘ =I= *

Another excellent album, and one which should have received
more recognition when it first came out is Yes (Atlantic SD 8243). This
first came out in 1969—it was Yes’ very first LP, but somehow didn’t

Search for the Holy Grill

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

As Brillant Savarin had very
little to say concerning the grilled
hamburger steak. he would most
likely have preferred something
a bit more substantial. But our

-culinary habits have evolved (or

perhaps regressed) from the time
of Le Grand Gastronome and we

have all come to love and know
the hamburger.

Contrary to popular belief. the
hot dog has recently fallen from
its pedestal of procedence and the
hamburger sandwich has sur-
mounted the throne of culinary
grace. It would seem that the

hamburger is very definitely here

to stay; just visit any of the bur-

" ger bistros which line Forbes Ave.

and you will quickly realize why.

The state of the hamburger in
Oakland in recent years has been
anythingbut laudable and any at-
tempt which one makes to find an
edinle version of America's fav-
orite sandwich borders on the di-
mentions of a pilgrmage to Mec-
ca. Our hamburger begins with
this article and we can only hope
and pray that by the conclusion of
this series, we may stumble upon
that place to which our undying
homage will be due.

With great sorrow, we remem-
ber the passing of Henry Henry.
that Oakland landmark which pro-
vided the delicacies. of the Tudor-
burger and the Cheddarburger
What a deligttful memory re-
mains of those rotund creations
prepared over an open fire; hearty
fare fit for the appetities of a
cardinal or a king. But now it_ is
no more and Oakland remains the
poorer because of its demise.

Nonetheless, the search contin-
ues and the most satisfying ham-
burger must be sought out. And
so. as the luncheon hour ap-
proaches, the faithful clientel
take ‘their places in their favorite
hmburger palace and-the daily
ritual is enacted.

An especially loyal group is to
be found at the Eat ’n Park Res-
taurant (home of Le Grand Gar-
con)’at noontime and it is here
that our study begins. Advertised
as “a-meal-in-itself,” the fame of
its hamburger sandwich rests
upon a supposed fulfillment of the
triple decker ideal-bun cheese-
burger, more bun; hamburger
with sauce and lettece, and even
more bun. Not surprisingly, the
bread portion wins out and rather
than an hamburger of repute, we
have bread sandwich.

It is admittedly a tasty bun but
the meat on the sandwich refuses
to come out from hiding. This
hamburger is garnished with a
pickle, wrapped in celophane, and

.served upon a plastic tray. While

one can hardly complain about the
rapidity of the service, in the en-
suing moments as the burger'is

consumed, one realizes thatthere '

is certainly no Escoffier on these
premises. Not surprisingly," no
one who is seeking a succulent pat-
ty of meat will go out of his way to
come here. '

The philosoply of the hamburg-.

er involved more than the sand- “ J

wich itself for the potable that ac-
companies it is of the utmost im- V
portance. We have evidently fall-
en upon hard times, however, for.
the colacraze has taken hold of

such establishments as the Eat . 

‘n Park. if you want Bordeaux"
with your sandwich, don't expect
to find it here.

Needless to say, wine with one's v —,
hamburger is certainly within‘ the ’ 

realm of reason, even in Oakland.
And it is with Bacchus‘ contribu-

tion to the taste of_the hamburg- 5 

er that we will renew our efforts
afresh in the new year. V

their recent concert can attest) andsomeone named Clive Bailey. And

they’re all great. 6

So be it for its value in tracing the evolution of Yes, or just be-
cause its one fantastic album, you cwe it to yourself to get this one.

Associate Sports Editor

This time around every Pitt and
Duquesne student will be given the
‘opportunity to see their respec-
tive teams clash in the 1972 Steel
Bowl Tournament to be held at the

’ Civic Arena today and tomorrow.

Actions begins tonight at 7 p.m.
with Jacksonville onfronting
Southern linois and then at 9
p.m. Pitt and Duquesne take over
the court. Tomorrow the winners

_5____ will battle it out at 9 while the los-

ers play a consolation match at 7.

5 In the past. the Steel Bowl gen-
erally took place during Christ-
mas vacation and many of the stu-
dents were unable to attend the
contest. But with the rescheduling
of the tournament, more people

Page 12-THE: PITT N EWS—--Friday, December 8, 1972 .

. will be able to witness the cross-

town rival.

Last year, the Panthers and the
Dukes participated in a real
grudge game on Dec. 30 when both
met in the championship game of
the tournament.

The Panthers rocketed Navy
with a 88-78 loss and the Dukes
slipped by Wage Forest. 57-56. to
earn the right to meet in combat.

The Dukes were out to avenge
the '70 loss to the Panthers and
they succeeded easily. The Cats
were cut down by the score of 87-
67.

This year both sides are again
anticipating a tough match. As
Duquesne’s head basketball coach
Red Manning put it, “It’s going to
,be a traditional rival game. The

outcome will depend on who’s up
for the game and who puts in the
baskets. A lot of it will be emo-
tional.”

An important‘ figure for the
Dukes will be the 6-9 junior Lionel
"Big Train" Billingy. Last season
he led the Dukes in scoring and
rebounding with averages of 21.6
a-nd 14.2. respectively. In the '71
Steel Bowl championship game
against the Cats, Billingy collect-

come up with 34 in the contest.

"I never enjoyed playing a slow-
down game—i_t’s excrusiating."
explained Ridl. "It‘s tough play-
ing that way. It's fun if you win it
I guess." , ~

Mannings main obective to-
night will be to stop Pitt's Bill
Knight. "Well try to do the job on
Billy Knight, but it‘s not a matter
of shutting off one guy.” 4

One of the reasons for Mannings

'victory over the Panthers last

year was the Dukes advantage at
the foul line. This may prove to
be a strong point for the Dukes
again this season.

The Panthers have some diffi-
culties with many players getting
into serious foul situations. So far
this season the Cats have com-

 

Tourney   Rivalry  

mitted 100 fouls.

"It’s a real mystery." stated
Ridl, concerning the foul situa-
tions of his players. "It looks like
were going to set a world's rec-
ord this year."

The probable starting lineup
for the Cats, who are 2-1 on the
season, will be Knight, Mickey
Martin, Jim Bolla, Ken Wagoner
or Willis Cardot, and Carl Morris
or Bill Sulkowski.

The Dukes <1-0 so far this sea-
son) starting against Pitt will be
Billingy. Montanez. Jack Wojdow,-
ski. Don McLane, and Oscar Jack-
son.

Anything can happen tongiht
against these two rivals. As Man-
ning put it, “I really don‘t know
what to expect."

“Billingy is a super player."
stated Pitt's head basketball
coach "Buzz" Ridl. "He has a fan-
tatic shot. I doubt ifyou can stop
him.” ‘ '

Ridl also has great respect for
the playing ability of senior Duke
Ruben Montanez. “He*s really
great — I saw him play in high
school,” related the Pitt mentor.

Pitt's strategy for confronting
these players and the rest of the
Duquesne squad will not be differ-
ent from the strategy employed
by the Cats in their last three
games this season. ’

"Were not going to do anything
drastic as far as changes go."
said Hidl. "Well do what we've
been doing."

Ridbindicated that he would not
play slowdown basketball against
the Dukes. This technique was
-- used by Steubenville against Du-
quesne last Monday. Steubenville
was able to hold: then to only 43
points in the entire game but they

it's like from‘ our practice scrimmages. but I never
thought I would be put into a game situation against
my own teammates-until last Wednesday night. i

If you're confused enough already. ten let me
explain. Just as the Zamboni was leaving the ice
before the Slippery Rock and Pitt squads took the
playing surface ‘the Rockets coach approched

 Pitt coach Guy Carole and explained torhim that

their goalie hadn’t shown up yet.

_ At first Slippery Rock was to forfeit the game
’and then the two squads would scrimmge. with
Pitt goaltender Mark Lieberman taking the nets for
the Rockets. but Carole worked out an agreement
with the Slippery Rock coach and officials at the
- game that would make the contest a real one—no
forfeit. carole. however. sent me to tend goal for
Slippery Rock. claiming that "you need the prac-
tice. ' . -
To say the least, I got the practice. I knew the
Slippery Rock team was nothing to write home
about, but their defense didn’t know what to do

against Pitt’s potent offense. The following ‘is
goalie’s eyeview of a nightmare. "

The first shot of the game on me was a break-
away. Right then and there I knew I was in for a
rough ride. Luckily. the shot was into my pads and
I was able to cover up. If Johnny Finney would have
looked around he would have seen two"more Pitt
jerseys and could have had a three on "none situa-
tion on me. ’

I kept Pitt off the scoreboard for the first six
minutes of the game but I have to admit that Billy
Glanville‘s goal for Pitt at the 5:54 mark was my
faul. Only a short while after that. Duke Schael’-
fer's shot fromthe point slid under m ‘pads as I
made a last ditch attempt to stop it after being com-
pletely screened by a Slippery Rock defenseman
didn't bother to try to block the shot himself. I

Now comes the part that I like: After a short
exchange in between the blue lines,’ the Pitt offense
came at me again. This time I was ready for them.
For sixlsolid minutes the Pitt skaters poured shots
and I managed to somehow keep the puck out of the
net. I had luck going for me too as both goalposts
were hit. The Slippery Rock defense finally de-
serted me with only 24 seconds left in the period.

Phil Clarke had the puck to the left of the net
and Glanville and Denny Browne were standing on
the corners of my crease. A Slippery Rock defen-
der was nowhere in sight. Clarke passed out to
Glanville who held the puck for a while and finally.
out of mercy. passed over to Browne for the goal.

The second period was a. bit more tragic for
me. I made 15 saves (33 over two periods) but the.
Slippery Rock team deserted me for about the fifth
time in the game. Denny Browne scored three times
while Dave Bahnson and Jeff Leston also found the

‘ back of the nets.

Slippery Rock goalie Tim Minor finally made
it to the Alpine fo'r the third period and got off eas-
ly. Pitt skaters missed the open net five or six times
and Pitt goalie _Mark Lieberman recorded his frst
career shutout. with the final score 9-0.‘j ' ’

Boisture May Be 
~ New Grid Coach

, by LARRY PALADINO _
/ Associated Press Sports Writer

DETROIT (_APi——Dan Boisture, head football coach at Eastern
Michigan University the past six years, is one of the top candidates for

P

the head coaching job at /the University of Pittsburgh, it has been _

learned.

Boisture. a one-time Michigan State assistant when the Spartans
were at their peak in the mid-60s, recently was interviewed at length
by Pitt Athletic. Director Casimir Myslinski. who is seeking a replace-
ment for Carl De‘Pasqua. '

DePasq'ua was f'ired two weeks ago and an informed source said
Boisture is high on the list of candidates for the job along with Coach
Johnny Majors of Iowa State and Homer Rice. athletic director at
North Carolina-.

Boisture would not deny the possibility of getting the Pitt job.

"I feel from my background I could do the job." he said. when con-
tacted by phone. "I have 15 years of college experience and I think I

' know what has to be done and how to get it done."

Pittsburgh's football fortunes have been going downhill for sever-
al years and this year the team suffered through a 1-10 season.

“I think Pitt is a diamond in the rough,” Boisture said, “and is"
willing to do things necessary to beat teams like Penn State, West Vir-

ginia, Syracuse, and Notre Dame.” 1

By doing things necessary he means all out in recruiting. ’
"Recruiting is the name of the game." he said. "You have to get the
ballplayers who are capable of beating teams like Penn State'
“I’ve recruited that area intensely and have gotten players from
all over the country,” added Boisture, an ex-Marine who was wounded
on Okinawa during World War II. ‘

While under Duffy Daughterty at NISU. Boisture recruited such
stars as George Webster. Gene Washington, Bubba Smith, Ed Budde,
Clint Jones, and George Saimes. All turned pro. -

.\lSU was ranked _No. 2 in the country in 1965 and 1966 when Bois-
ture was there. He took the EMU job in 1967 and became the winningest
percentage .710 football coach in the Huron's history.

Under Boisture the Hurons have won 39, lost 16. and tied three.
Last year's only loss was in the Pioneer Bowl—the team’s first bowl

?__To Take On Owls

by YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt swim team will take on
the Temple Owls at Trees Hall to-
morrow at 2 p.m.

Both teams look good on paper
and have an even chance of ‘win-
ning but the Cats will.be out to
avenge a loss to Temple in last
_year’s meet. Temple won the
meet in the last event. 63-50.

Temple looks very strong after
having won all of their first three

meets. Their victims were But»

gers, American Li.. an‘d Blooms-

_ burg State.

Pitt is looking to stop this streak
with performances from Mark
Wallace in the backstroke, Dave
Natali in the .220, yard butterfly,
John Templin in the 200 yard
breaststroke, and Mark Winters
in the distance swimming.

Temple sports a good team of
upperclassmen, among them sev-
en seniors. This could be a vital
factor against the predominantly
freshman Pitt team. The Owls
stars include ‘seniors Dan Gslsg—
her, Wayne King, and Tim Elliott

JEFF MILLER

MARK WALLACE

while one of their most outstand-A

ing swimmers is freshman Mike
Lowler. -
Temple's strong events include
the 1000 yard freestyle. the 200
yard individual medley. the 200
yard freestyle. and the 50 and 100
yard freestyle sprints. '
Both teams seem to be very
good in the freestyle and medley
relays, and the same holds true’
for. the diving events. .

For the Cats, Jack Garrow an
Jeff Miller won a first place in the
three meter diving relay and
fourth place last week in the one
meter diving at Penn Sate. If
there is anywhere the team needs
improvement, says Coach _Dick
Bradshaw, its in 500 and 100 yard
freestyle races.

The Panthers have been very

- lucky so far in reference to the in-

jury situation. They will have a
healthy team to face Temple.

All in all, this should be an ex-
citing match. The Temple Owls
are due for a loss and the Pitt

-team may be just the ones to give

it to them.

It’s no fun being a loser. and

The Panthers will be trying to

CRAIG TRITCH

the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor last Saturday which has
rendered them, temporarily, win-
less. The Pitt wrestling team was
handed a humiliating 32-2 loss
by the powerful Big Ten team. 4

"The big thing concerning this
match is aggressiveness." said
Coach Dave Adams. “We must be
much more aggressive. It‘s some-
thing we‘ve been working on all
week long.”

»Temple’s Owls, who are 1-0,
coming off a win over Gettysberg
last week, have four grapplers

The cleaned barley malt is stored until needed for

Many beers would be ready for artificial carbonation, filtering and bottling at this point.‘ but not Budweiser.
lnstead. it goes to huge tanks in the l_ager,cellars. Here, beechwood strips are spread across the bottom of each ‘

[actually as much as_tIme times as long as the process some beers use!) and costs
more money, but the strips of heechwood provide extra surface for the brewers'
yeast to cling to— and help clarify the beer naturally.) \_

Meanwhile. specially selected rice is crushed in separate mills‘
and weighed. Budweiser is brewed with rice (including actual
table-grade rice) even though many brewers use corn syrup instead
because it is much cheaper. But cheaper is not for Budweiser.
