Smith ‘Greatest’

The Hurricanes have a strong run-

passing. Their rushing leader is
Frank Smith, rated by many as the
greatest halfback in Miami football
history.

Smith is averaging 6.3 yards per
try with 279 yards in 44 attempts.
Against Purdue, Smith gained 135

2   Band Donations Roll In;
Alumni Aid Sought

Prospects that the Pitt Band will be on the Notre Dame field
come Armistice Day looked bright yesterday as a late afternoon
count showed that the IF Council-Pitt News sponsored ‘Send the
Band to Notre Dame’ drive had netted $1020.77 in receipts and

pledges up to that time.

Rumors that private interests might come through with a large

donation flew about the campus as
drive leaders continued to seek
some means of contacting alumni
who have expressed a desire to
contribute to the campaign.

No Stadium Collection
University officials have ruled
- out any’ solicitations at tomorrow’s
Homecoming game and celebration
other than a possible canvas of the
student section of the stadium.
The asked-for permission to can-
vass alumni sitting in the public
was refused because it
was felt that private citizens and
Miami rooters in those areas would
feel compelled to contribute against
their will were a collection made
during the game.

Fraternity men, organized by IF
Council, made an all-out effort dur-
ing the week to gain contributions
on campus, collecting $502.50 at
the last count. In addition, many
fraternities have pledged lump sums
from their own memberships, accord-
ing to President Jim Morton.

Students Contribute
So far the largest individual stu-
dent contributions noted were given
by Yussuf Ibrahim, who turned in
two checks totalling $11, and Joe
Berger, a freshman, who contributed

310.

' Other contributors include Mayor
David L. Lawrence, Prothonotary
David 3. Roberts, Dr. William D.

Winds Up Homecoming

Homecoming Dance tomorrow night at the Schenley Hotel ball-
room will wind up a weekend of festivities honoring Pitt alumni.

‘Sponsored by the freshman class and the Women's Self-
Govemment Association, the informal dance will run from 9 to 12

p.m.

Music for the occasion will be supplied by Benny Benack and

his orchestra with Gloria Bergman
as the featured vocalist.

Tickets are priced at $2.25 for
advance sale and $2.75 at the door.

According to Alberta Ignelzi,
social chairman of WSGA, tickets
for the dance are going fast and
anyone who has not obtained a
ticket yet may do so from any mem-
ber of Freshman Council, W-SGA,
Men’s Council, or at the Student

The dance will climax a series
of affairs that includes a dinner for
the alumni tonight, sponsored by
the Varsity Letter Club, a pep rally
and torchlight parade on the cam-
pus tonight, a luncheon for the
alumni tomorrow and, of course,
the Miami game tomorrow after-
noon.

Rumors have been flooding the
campus that various fraternities
are holding affairs the same time
as the dance.

IF president Jim Morton stated
that “fraternities are forbidden to
hold any affairs Saturday night
since it is a closed night.”

Any group not abiding by this
rule will be fined at the discretion
of the SC Social Committee.

Band Show

As the University goes, so goes
the band.

Last week the University paid
tribute to Pennsylvania. The band
did likewise through its half-time
formations even though it perform-
ed at Northwestern.

This week the University wel-
comes back its graduates. The
band follows suit with a set of
formations that honor the alumni.
The formations and music were de-
signed to bring back happy memo-
ries. Except for one number, the
half-time music was written by
former Pitt students.

The band opens its routine-
with a fanfare, “Salute to the
Band”, written by Dr. C. S. Harris
Dent. School, ’lS. The band then
forms the salutation "HI” and
moves it across the field in the
direction of the alumni section.

The band knew the alumni were
coming so they baked a cake, a
slice of which is formed on the

field. The music for this is “If I—

Knew You Were Corning, l’d Have
Baked a Cake.”

The band then forms the object;

most significant of the University
of Pittsburgh, the Cathedral of
Learning, complete with local and
express elevators. The band plays:
the most widely known Pitt song,
"Hail to Pitt”, written by L.M.
Taylor, Engr., ’12.

Next formation is a big crowd
that turns and a tone arm that
moves across the record. Dr. Har-
ris’ “Panther Song” is the music

Ellsworth Council Attempts

lChest Drive

‘Outside Fund-Raising
A For Band Trip Opposed

By JOHN KULAMER
Dean of Men T. W. Biddle told Student Congress last Monday
that he is opposed to soliciting money from the general public

in student- spon sored camp ai gns.

Inhis first appearance before Congress this year, the dean

explained that it

organizations to ask the public for
money in a fund—raising drive.

Andy Schurman brought up the
subject by asking the dean if col-
lections could be made at halftime

tof the Pitt-Miami game to raise
money for the current ‘Send the Band
to Notre Dame’ campaign.

More Money -- Fast!

Schurman said if the ‘band is to
go to Notre Dame the money will
have to be raised as quickly as
possible to avoid interference with
the Pitt Chest drive which starts
the week of November 6.“After all,”
said Schurman, “our first duty is to

. the Pitt Chest.”

He then suggested that the Pitt-
Miami game would provide the best
opportunity for large-scale solici-
tations.

The dean answered that, in his
opinion, such solicitation would
be permissible, but in the student
section only. "We feel,” he said,
“that we should collect money for
such purposes as the band trip and
the Pitt Chest only from students,
alumni, and special friends of the
University.”

J New Buildings Named

The clean said more :5 Congress,
but on another subject: Pitt’s cur-
rent building program. Earlier in the
meeting he listed the nurses’ home,
the new field house, the addition to
Falk Elementaryschool and_the new
cyclotron as projects now under
construction. The total ‘value of
these is $5,655,000.

Aside from the dean’s report, how-
ever, the legislative calm was dis-
turbed by only a few items of im-
iponance. With an eye to Monday’s
“Invasion” of the Pitt campus by
Duquesne’s victory celebrators,
Andy Schurman introduced a motion
to appoint a committee to bring in a
resolution expressing Congress’
attitude toward student conduct at
victory rallies. The motion W35
carried.

Frosh Gals Know

Their Customs

Freshman women have a thorough
knowledge of Pitt’s traditions and
history, if the recent customs exam
can be taken as valid.

Nearly half the class, 105 women,
made a score of 95 or above,acco'rd-
ing to WSGA Customs committee.
A score of 100 was perfect.

As a reward for her successful
orientation, each freshman who
passes the exam is given a pan-
ther pin with the date of her grad-
uation on it. She also no longer
wears her green armband.

Welfare State Debate

On Town Meet Tonite

The YMCA and YWCA-sponsored
Town Meeting series opens today
with a debate between three mem-
bers of the Men’s Debate team and
a team from Western Reserve Uni-
versity.

The debate is open to the public.
It will be held at 12:30 p.m. in room

The debaters will discuss “Re-

Marriage, Mud,
Med Students"
All Plague Owl

Life isn't all a nest of hay for
Owl circulation manager, Harry
Scharf.

His current problem, he says,
concerns the answers he has
been getting to cards sent in-
wiring of seniors whether or not
they have ordered an Owl.

one business atkninistration
senior did1't order the yearbook,
because he and his girl friend
would share the same one; he
said they hope to be married by
then. ’ . ‘

Another of Scharf's headaches
is helping Jerry Simon, business
manager, with publicity at foot-
ball games. Han-y stood in the
mud-at the rainy Rice game try-
ing to send up advertising
balloons. “They went over like
lead balloons,” he reported.

Med school students who do
not have time to have their pic-
tures taken, students who forget
to show up for picture appoint-
ments, and lack of Owl sales-
men are also problems which are
plaguing him.

[hit the last straw for Scharf
was a notice from the Naval re-
serve to report for his physical
Wednesday night.

Seeks Help

With the annual Pitt—Chest Drive
slated for Wednesday, Nov. 8, John
Rost and Elaine Tiefield, co-chair-
men of the speakers committee,find
themselves in urgent need of Pitt
student speakers.

The speakers will address stu-
dents in classes and on the campus
the 3rd and 6th hours on Nov. 8.

Anyone who has promised to
speak orwho is interested in speak-
ing should attend one or both of the
orientation meetings to be held in
the social room of the Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial on Thursday, Nov. 2
at 12:30 and Friday,Nov. 3at1:30.

A speaker having classes the
3rd and 6th hours can either speak
to his own class or be excused to
speak to other classes.

At the conclusion of his speech,
he will pass out collection enve-
lopes to his listeners.

They can put their entire donation
in at once or sign a pledge and pay
it at the Student Desk later.

Election Poll
Slated Here

For the next two weeks the News
will conduct a day-by-day poll of
the student body to ascertain student
political opinion on the coming
state-wide election.

Although a great number of stu-
dents are below legal voting age,
they do have opinions. It is this
opinion that the News will try to
record.

On Tuesday, Nov. 7, Pennsyl-
vania voters will render theirchoice
for the state's most important poli-
tical offices. The nation’s political
leaders will be watching closely
Pennsylvania’s choice for gover-
nor and senator. As in Ohio the sig-
nificant factor is not the individual
who wins, but the plurality by which
he will carry his party to_ power.

invite one member of Fre“§hman
Council at Ellsworth to attend the
remainder of the meetings with a
voice, but no vote, in order to in-
sure freshman representation. The
motion was carried.

Albert Johnson, Ellsworth’s re-
presentative to Men’s Council, in

his report on the dink program at t

the Center indicated it was far from
desirable at present.

The other visitor, sophomore
Dave Sunderman, an upper-class
counsellor, said one of the reasons
EC freshmen don’t wear dinks is
because they were promised spe cial
mixer dances but weren’t given
them.

Johnson said that the dink pro-
gram should be carried out similar
to hazing as used by fraternities.
Sunderman replied that Roy TitCh-
worth, president of Men’s Council,
had definitely stated that it was not
to be like hazing.

The University of Pittsburgh is fortunate. It not only has the
finest band in the country, but it has 140 men with enough school
spirit to ﬁeld the band regardless of the many problems they run
up against.

Such is not the case of George Washington University,
Washington DC. This university, with an enrollment of 12,225,
cannot field a band of 70 musicians, even with the following in-
ducements: band members are exempt from taking gym; after one
year in the band they receive sweaters and certificates; out-
standing members are presented with keys and trophies at the
band’s annual picnic and banqiet; band members receive free
mealsand transportation to University games.

The band president told a reporter for the campus paper,
"The University Hatchet” that the only way to get new bands-
men and require them to attend all functions would be offer them
h al f- scholarship s.

The story in the paper said that since the band is unable to
force its members to attend practices and performances, they have
been using “professionals, boys club members and students from
local high schools and colleges.”

* * * *

An editorial in the "Daily Pennsylvanian,” campus news
paper for the University of Pennsylvania, also bewails its trouble
in putting a band on the field.

The editorial ‘says the band has been drilling about 12 hours
a week in order "to perfect a myriad of fancy formations as well

as an impressive quick step, all reminiscent of the ﬂash Pitts-
Y

burgh band that took Franklin Field by storm last year.”

It went on to say, however, that the band members would not
or could not practice 12 hours a week even though excused from
gym. For the game with Virginia, a band comprised of 60 men in-
stead of the usual 100 performed.

Accordingly practice hours were cut but still nothing happens.
The college paper feels that it is a choice between a good little
band and a poor big band. The editorial concluded, “With the
help of those lax musicians, we could have a good big band that
would make everybody happy. 1’

iii!!!

At Ohio State, where they have one of the best bands in the
country, they also have the facilities to create such a band.

Band members, all ROTC cadets, receive credit for military
science while they are in the band. During the school quarter
when the marching band is active, bandsmen are required to at-
tend only one ROTC class a week. They drill two hours a day,
five days a week. ’

****

By comparison with these three schools, Pitt is lucky to
have such a fine musical and matching group.

The band has no building it can call its own. Rehearsals are
held on the basketball court of the stadium. Drills take place on
the practice field above the stadium, usually a sea of mud.

Help Set New

College Fad
by MYRON KOPELMAN

Y0_u figure it is logical if a hard-
working clothing salesman works
his way up to a top position in a
haberdashery concern, and you
say, ."Well naturally,” if an in-
dustrious reporter propels himself
into a high _editorship.

But such logic becomes brash
assumption when applied to the
education business.

In this post-war era, it is be-
coming unthinkable that a univer-
sity should select its president
from the ranks of educators. What
is needed is a "name,” a man who
can handle himself on a political
soap box.

Take Penn’s Hal Stassen and
Columbia's Ike Eisenhower, for
examples.

Second Picking:

Hal, you may recall, was the
young Republican who lost out in
the last presidential primary.
Failing to become president of the
nation, Hal took the presidency at
Penn.

So far, it looks as though the
only people Hal has tried to edu-
cate is the voting population -- a
preparatory course for the 1952
election year, perhaps.

Hal’s latest lecture was to Joe
Stalin, with whom Professor Hal
said he was quite willing to hold a
conference in order to straighten
out the world situation. Joe said
no thanks, not even tuition-free.

Who Asked Hal?

Of course, the taxpayers had
not asked President Hal to hold
talks with Stalin. Usually, that is
the work of Truman or the State
Department. But again, you have
got to remember that the education
business has considerably widened
its scope of late.

Then there is Eisenhower ex-
pounding in Pittsburgh’s Carnegie
Hall last week. " Another
‘ ‘educator. ’ ’

Since when is it the function of
college president to go on a tour,
lecturing on cold war policy? How-
ever, it is necessary to remember
that Ike is a special type educator,
carefully trained for the education
business by the U. S. Army.

And the man has also been
mentioned as possible Republi-
can presidential timber, you know.

Situation Confusing

At this stage of the game, it is
becoming difficult for the punk col-
"lege student to understand why it
is raved that Communists. are unfit
to teach because they will opi-
nionize thei!"'students onto wrong
paths. Sure, that contention is
true, but he‘re'are the eminent edu-
cators, Ike~ and Hal, not exactly
lecturing impartially.

Here at Pitt, Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald will not be caught
issuing a statement on the Govern-
ment’s policy of putting keep-off-
the-grass signs on the Capitol
lawn. Maybe his silence stems
from the fact that Pitt is too hard

up for funds to risk offendinga soul.

But whatever the reason, Fitz-
gerald’s restraint is a welcome re-
lief from the two Destiny Boys
back East.

Confusion has resulted from the
variety of names applied to the
affair. The names you have been
hearing -- "Homecoming Dance,”
"Freshman Dance,” “All-Campus
Dance” - all mean the same thing.
They apply to the freshman-sponsored
all-campus dance to be held the
night of the Pitt-Miami game to cele-
brate homecoming.

To top it all off Miami University
is holding a dance for its alumni in
the Pittsburgh area at the William
Penn Hotel. A rumor quickly spread
around campus that Pitt students
were invited. Since then word has
been received that it is closed to
everyone except Miami students or
alums. -

Then, too, persistent reports are
circulating that several fraternities
are violating University social rules
and holding affairs that evening. In-
terfraternity Council President Jim
Morton has tried to squelch these
illegal affairs but it is not known if'

Student leaders are frankly worried about the possible suc-
cess (or failure) of the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night.

Surrounded by confusion, in the hands of inexperienced fresh-
men, and beset by possible competition from al‘-liami Dance and
from various fraternity affairs to be held the same night, the
dance does seem to have two strikes against it.

they will go through or not.

Shades of Appomattox

And while Korea, ROK’s,Com- A

munists, and the draft are vital sub-
jects to Pitt students now, the war
and its terms have taken on a differ-
ent meaning to some of its younger
observers.

Gus, seven-year-old son of As-
sociate Professor Louis Johnston,
came home the other day with the
statement: "I wish General Mac-
Arthur weren’t helping the South
Koreans. I don't like him fighting
for,the Confederates.”

PiKA’s Win
Again, Stop
Theta Chis

By DAVE GROTJOHAN

A high powered, six-cylindered
PiKA machine, spark-plugged by
Al Locnikar, had a little trouble
getting started Monday at Schenley
oval. But after a bad backfire the
PiKA’s warmed up and rolled over
the Theta Chis, 27-8.

In the first quarter thePiKA’swere
scored on, or scored on themselves,
for the first time this season. A
blocked PiKA kick did the deed.

The Theta Chi team then looked
as though they were going to be
troublesome‘ as a pass from Jack
Doyle to Frank Thomas gave them
a touchdown and an 8-0 lead.

Then it started,_and there was no
stopping it. The PiKA’swoke up. A
fancy Dan passing play that went
from Al Breuck to Ron Livingston
to Al Locknikar resulted in their
first touchdown.

Another Breuck pass was caught
by Locnikar for the second touch-
down. The PiK‘A’s_ next two points
came when, they blocked a Theta
Chi kick for a safety.

From there "Lock” took over
again as he caught his third touch-
down pass, this one from Living-

The Locals turned a two touch-

Tuesday at Schenley Oval. The
winners, leading the IM National
League, took their third straight
with a strong first and blazing
last quarter on Tuesday.

The Locals opened up early in
the game when, after a sustained
drive netting three first downs,
John Hlesnik passed to Jay,John-

13-0.

During the latter part of the__sec-
ond half,the Locals again exhibited
the power that led them to the IM
championship in 1948'.

Gene Gaugler scored a pair of
TD’s. The first came on a long
pass fromKennyMcKowan,followed
by a 20-yard sprint. His second
came on a screen pass from Hles-
nik. Hlesnik again completed to
Andy Roclovich for the Local’s
final touchdown.

game, the Locals stabbed through

Raiders for a safety in their own

Ferguson in Shape

The frosh will be at full strength
this afternoon. Matt Ferguson, who
missed the Kiski game because of
a sprained ankle, will start at right
half back Bobbie Ingram, who re-
ceived a head injury on the first
play against Kiski, will start at
center.

Operating at quarterback will be
Manuel Campa, Lou Cimarolli at
left half and Bobbie Epps at full-
back. Art DiGiovanni, a reserve
halfback, is expected to see plenty
of action. He and Epps lead the
frosh touchdown parade with two
apiece. To support this backfield
is a line averaging 196 pounds.

Bob Osterhout, the third-string quarterback who made such a terrific

Perhaps the force with which
Osty throws the ball is one reason
why he was almost lost in the shuf-

but still gave the receivers trouble

Osterhout is extremely effective

Buelgeyes Drop Diehards
From Unbeaten Ranks,34-6

The undefeated teams of the intra-
mural leagues are starting to fall by
the wayside. A once powerful, unde-
feated Faculty Diehard team was
stopped Wednesday night at Schen-
ley Oval, losing to the Buckeyes,
34-6.

The key factor in the Buckeye win
was the accuracy of Kay Lewis’
passes. He completed four touch-
down passes, one to Chuck Martin
and Bill Ford, and two to Dick
McCarthy.

McCarthy also completed a touch-

‘ down pass to Ford.

The Faculty’s only score came on
a pass from Bill Rudoy to Bill
Greece.

The Buckeyes are now becoming
one of the powers of the league as
they have three wins and no set-
backs.

 Wrestlers

Double as 9

Linemen

Unfortunately for Pitt, there are
rules 'in football prohibiting holding.

The Panthers, you see, have a
pair of linemen coming upwho know
their holds as well, if not better,
than their blocks. Both were out-
‘standing wrestlers in high school.

Former all-WPIAL guard Tom
Alberts from Waynesburg is probably
better known among Western Penn-
sylvanians as two-year 165-pound
state wrestling champ, while Tackle‘
Gail Ellis, 2. relative “furriner”'
from Tulsa, Oklahoma, held the un-
limited weight title in an Oklahoma
school that emphasized wrestling
over football.

_ Family Tradition

In Alberts, Pitt has one of the
‘finest high school Wrestlers to be
turned out in this district. Al-
though a talented gridder (he was
on the third-string all-state squad
last season), the 5-9}/2 Pennsylvan-
ian has a profound fondness for the

. grunt-and-groan sport.

after my brother started wrestling,”
stated the 175-pound guard, "and
wrestled for four years at Waynes-
burg.”

The advent of the T here, be-
sides the added interest in wrestl-
helped the Panthers secure
Alberts. Tom, however, has another

I t 3
reason for his entry into Pitt.
"I wanted to go to a collegenear
home.” he says.

Far from Home
Pitt’s other football-wrestler did
the opposite. He selected a site
over 2,000 miles from home.

THE PITT NEWS —

Friday, October 27, 1950 -- Page?

day has often been called the Pitt of the South. Of its faculty 26

members are Pitt graduates.

Dr. Bowman Foster Ashe, first and only president of the
University of Miami, received his bachelor of science degree at

Pitt in 1912.

Ashe was University examiner
and student counselor from 1921 to

Since it is Coach Len Casa-
nova’s first appearance before a
Pitt homecoming crowd, the band
joins the grads in wishing Cas
good luck. The band plays “The
Victory Song” by Benjamin Le-
vant, Med., ’2l, as they form a
horseshoe with a ‘C’ in the middle

. of it.

A music lyre is then formed on
the field in honor of the Miami
Band and their advisor, Henry
Fillmore, noted composer of mar-
ches. Fillmore will direct the Pitt
band in his match, “Men of Flo-
rida.” ‘

The half-time will be brought to
a close with the formation of the
Panther head to the music of
Harris’s "Battle Song” and the
playing of the “Alma Mater.”
