Steeler mania has subsided a bit
in the last few weeks but die-hard
fans can rest easy on their Terrible
Towels tonight knowing that there
are two Terrible Towels flying at
the South Pole.

Dr. William Cassidy, professor
of geology, spent December and
part of January on an expedition in

Antarctica to gather samples of

meteorites. The expedition includ-
ed Cassidy as its primary research-
er, two'NASA scientists, a research-'
er from the Battelle Institgte, a stu-
dent from the University of
Washington and a Japanese scien-
tist, since U.S. research in the area
on this subject has been in a joint
effort with the Japanese.

The study was funded by the Na-
tional Science Foundation to gather

However, Schulman‘ cited these

“There was no precipitation, and
most days it was between -10 and 10
degrees, but with the wind chill fac-
tor it was -60,” said Cassidy. “We
had special clothing, rations and
tents.” ' ' l '

“One of the things we had to get

‘used to when we returned was see-

ing sunsets and night skies, because

it is light 24 hours a day at the,

South Pole,” said Cassidy.

Cassidy explained the importance
of meteorites that fall in that area.

and regularly include non-‘CAS
courses among those required for a

’ The council plans to discuss the

implementation of more structured

guidelines and procedures in this
area at their next meeting, accor-
dingto Schulman. . _

In -other academic areas, the
council approved the certiﬁcate
program in film studies discussed at
the lastmeeting. Schulman cited the
approval as an important moment
for the college and added that the
program should have a bright
future. ._ '

The film program’s .relationship
with the Pittsburgh Film Makers is
still a “significant policy matter

portant, and we study them for two ‘

reasons, ” he said.

“First, they let us know about the" _

environment of space. They are ex-
posed to high level radiation and
collisions with other bodies. And
second, they are extremely
primitive, some date to the time

when the sun and the planets
originated.’’ ‘

“Some of the samples even date
before geological history began,”
Cassidy said. “The amino acids
which are building blocks for life as
we know it, are also present in some
of the meteorites.”

Though the scientific aspect of .

the expedition was the primary ob-

‘jective, the sight of a Skidoo ﬂying

over ice fields at the South Pole
with two Myron Cope Terrible

enough to get those Steeler fans

Former County Coroner Dr.
Cyril Wecht discussed alcoholism
and society Monday at the 24th An-
nual Julius A. Koch Memorial Lec-
ture. Wecht told about 80 people
gathered in Scaife Hall that,
“widespread use of alcohol is why
we have trouble getting society to
look at the problem.” 

He noted that since it’s discovery,
alcohol has been a problem in every
civilized society.

Alcoholism was not identified as
a disease until the 1960s, and most
people still don’t consider alcohol a

drug, acccording to Wecht. To deal
with the problem the current county
commissioner suggests education of
the nation's young (grade school
age) students.

“Educating our young would be
a step in the right direction,
however, is it a reality? We can
point out the harmful affects of
alcohol, but they (children) see their
parents doing it (drinking) and call
us hypocrits,” he said. ,

Citing his experience in forensic
medicine, Wecht said, “From a
medical point of view, we find more
morbidity and mortality from
alcohol than all other drugs com-

bined.”

Other facts he pointed out werei

—Five percent of all Americans
suffer some form of alcoholism.
This is higher than for any other
disease, excluding pathological
groupings;

—Of more than 20,000 murders
in the U. S. yearly, more than half
of the assailants have a significant
amount of alcohol‘ in their blood
(greater than 0.1 percent);

—Between 50,000 and 55,000
people die in auto-related accidents
every year; over‘ half of the drivers
involved have alcohol in significant

Could Receive Tenure Reports

By RICH LAZZARO
Pitt News Staff Writer

A proposal to send tenure com-
mittee reports to department
chairmen was the main topic of
discussion at yesterday’s Faculty of
Arts and Science meeting.

Under this proposal, the head of
the department to which the can-
didate is seeking tenure will receive
a copy of the review committee’s
report to analyze and make recom-
mendations. Presently, only the

Dean of FAS has access to these

reports.
While support for this proposal

was nearly unanimous, College of .

Arts and Sciences Dean Irwin J.

_Schulman noted that offering

department heads access to these
reports also increased the possibility
of informational leaks. Schulman
added that while this isn’t probable,

_the possibility does exist.

In a related development FAS
Dean Jerome Rosenberg reported
that the university is providing the
Equal Opportunity Commission
with access to files on third year
tenure candidates. This is the result
of a common pleas court judge’s
ruling in a case brought against Pitt
by the Pittsburgh Human Relations
Commission on behalf of a dismiss-
ed faculty member who was denied
tenure at Pitt.‘ Although the Equal
Opportunity Commission had re-
quested access to such items as
teaching evaluations and tenure
committee review reports, access is
limited to only information submit-
ted by the candidate, Rosenberg
said.

Rosenberg also reported the

The university is being audited
because there have been complaints
about unfair practices lodged
against it, Rosenberg said.

The auditing team has access to
files but will not be allowed to
remove or make copies of these files
according to Rosenberg. He added,
however, that copies of semi-public
statements such as departmental

policies will be provided to the .

auditors upon request. -

Rosenberg said that Pitt will
cooperate with the auditors to
“avoid protracted and costly legal
arguments.” ,

that it was still too early to gauge

  Wecht Lectures On Dangers OfAlcohoI Abuse

—Over half of the 50,000 to.

100,000 people at year who commit

suicide have traceable amounts of I

alcohol in their bodies.

One of the problems of
alcoholism is identifying the victim.
“The alcoholic is not necessarily a
lower society person staggering
down the street late at night,” said
Wecht. “People from all walks of
life and social status suffer.”

When asked to give a definition
of an alcoholic, Wecht answered,
“There is no standard definition.
I’d say it is somebody who drinks
on a regular basis, not only socially.

\

It isn’t necessarily an executive with
his martini’s, either. It can be a fac-
tory worker having a few beers at
lunch time, or it can be a housewife ~
who sips white wine all day.”

Wecht also added that more str-
ingent enforcement of current
alcohol laws should be followed but
that it would be “sheer lunacy” to
prohibit it.

A plaque was presented to Wecht
following the lecture by the Alpha “*'
Omicron Chapter of the Rho Chi
Society in the School of Pharmacy,
who sponsored the event.

WILKES-BARRE, Pa. - Friends
of former Rep. Daniel Flood
reacted with surprise, disappoint-
ment and silence Tuesday after
hearing that the man who had
represented them for more than 30
years had pleaded guilty to a federal
conspiracy charge.

“I’m very surprised,” said John
Cresko of Kingston, upon learning
that the 76-year-old Democrat had

been sentenced to one-year proba- _

tion by U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in Washington.

“I’ve known him over 30 years,”
Cresko said in a telephone inter-
view. “I’m a Republican, but I’m
not alone. Dan Flood was very well
respected throughout this com-
munity. If he were to run again, he
would be re-elected.”

Flood retired from the. House

bribery, perjury and conspiracy.
The more serious charges, alleging
he took money forvusing his in-
fluence then lied about it to a grand
jury, were dropped in a plea
bargain agreement.

Former mayor Walter Lisman,
another longtime friend who had

defended Flood staunchly, said he '

had just heard the news and had lit-
tle to say. ’ ‘

“I have mixed emotions. But I
don’t have any comment to
make,” he said.

A year ago, after Flood’s first
trial ended with a hung jury,
Lisman had predicted he would be
found innocent in a retrial.

Cresko said he believed Flood
may have been prompted to plea
bargain because of the recent death
of Helen Tomascik, his office assis-
tant, who was buried last Friday.

the meeting. Board member Janice

“I’m very much disappointed
that he did this, but I would say this
the death is what prompted this,”
Cresko said. A

“She was his right arm. She had
been with him 27 years.”

State Rep. Bernard O’Brien,
D-Luzerne County, said he attend-
ed the funeral and that Flood had
given no indication he would plea
bargain, even though the agreement
was secretly worked out that same
day in the judge’s chambers.

“Let me tell you something. I

was with the poor guy and he could I

hardly walk. He was feeble. And to
take a man like that and put him in
prison, or to put him through a
trial, would just be a waste of tax-
payers’ money. '

“The fact that he had to resign
as" a congressman meant more to
him than anything,” O’Brien said

MANILA, Philippines—A
powerful explosion believed
caused by a World War II bomb
fed into a scrap-iron furnace
rocked a Manila suburb Tues-
day, killing two persons and in-
juring at least 25 others, police
reported.

The blast was so powerful it
shot small chunks of molten
‘iron as far as 1‘/2 miles, and
pieces as big as footballs rained
down within a 500-yard radius,
said Hermenegildo Rosagaron,
a police corporal in suburban
Mandaluyong.

He said the explosion occur-
red at 4:20 p.m.. five minutes

after workers had thrown the ‘
last batch_of scrap iron into a
10-ton furnace of the Apollo,
Steel Corp., which melts scrap
into ingots for sale to steel mills.

“We are still investigating,
but we’re almost positve now it
was an old bomb that caused
it,” Rosagaron told a reporter. '

He said the dead were a fur-
nace worker and a pedestrian.
Most of the injured, including
several in serious condition in ,
hospitals, were workers.

The Manila area was the scene
of heavy fighting, including
aerial bombardment, between
U‘.S. and Japanese forces early
in World War II. ‘ .

' ~i i.Men Get
E Guiness Wish

— LANETT, Ala.—Three men who
took a 6,753.3-,mile taxi ride from
Alabama to South Dakota in 1978

‘finally have the recognition they

wanted. Their feat is recorded in

‘ the ‘1980 edition of the Guiness
, Book of World Records.

.And even though his name and
hometown were misspelled, Charles
“Seagull” Dailey of Lanett said,

_“It’s the biggest thing that ever

happened to me.”
Dailey and his fellow adven-
turers, Freddie Hamby of Lanett

and Herbert Sedinger of Opelika,
found out Monday that their feat
was accepted by Guiness. They got
the good news from their public
relations manager, Harlan Parks,
who had picked up a copy of the
Guiness book at a bookstore.

The cab trip began Sept. 9, 1978,
at West Point Dam near Lanett. It
officially ended 16 days later in
Kadoka, S.D., when the 1974
Plymouth taxi pulled to a stop on
Main Street. — . .

The cab fare was $3,800, which
went to Wadkins Cab Co. Sedinger
bartered his fare in return for ser-
vices as a mechanic.

The previous record of 6,572
miles was set in 1976 by two
women, Ann Darche and Nesta

Sgro, who started from Hoboken, -

N.J. and traveled through 15 states
for a cab fare of $2,500.

Nog the Demon
Comes Alive

SULLIVAN, Ohio - Nog, the
Demon Creature of the African
jungle, has come to life in Ashland
County as the main character in an
animated film produced by a teen-
ager.

Steven Kalman, 16, wrote the
script, built the sets_and is shooting
the ﬁlm for “Nog, The Demon
Creature.’ .

“I’m the diretor, producer and
even the stage hand,” said Kalman,
who wants to pursue a career in the
animated film business.

Kalman says he started out by
creating ﬂip booklets of animated

because he says,

characters, and nowcreates model
characters for his films, most of
which are in black and white,
it’s easier to
camouflage mistakes that way.
The next step is to film his pro-
duction with an 8 mm camera and
color film.‘ Kalman had been mak-
ing animated films for the past year
and a half, ‘but “Nog, the Demon
Creature” is the first to have a plot.
The film is listed in alcurrent issue
of “Cinemagic,” a magazine
devoted to making films at home.

Goat Visits

Governor

BOISE, Idaho—Larry Seale,

delivering papers to the governor
Sunday night when he noticed
another visitor peering at him
through a glass door.

_ Upon investigation, he

goat tied to a door near the office of
Gov. John Evans. I

Having no apparent pressing

business with the governor, the goat

received a police escort from the
State Capitol. ’_

Last Supper

Reborn

WELLS, Maine—The last supper
is over. But the operator of the
Temple of Bacchus hopes it will be
reborn as an antique shop.

Vincent J. Morino is seeking
Zoning Board of Appeals permis-
sion to run ‘an antique business

from his 200-year-old home on U.S.
1. The case will be heard next week.

The Temple of Bacchus, named
for the Roman god of wine and

' revelry, opened in 1978 after the

zoning board denied a bid by
Morino and H. Carlisle Estes to
convert the home into a restaurant.

Estes and Morino founded the
temple, offering lavish “church
suppers” in return for‘ $15 dona-
tions. Morino is a cardinal and
Estes a bishop—having obtained
religious titles by mail from the
Universal Life Church of Modesto,
Calif.

Town fathers went to court, say-
ing the “divine feasts” were a ruse
to circumvent zoning laws. Estes
and Morino said the case raised the
constitutional_ issue of religious
freedom. -

An agreement was worked out to
allow the temple to hold 12 feasts a
year. , The most recent was last
May, and the temple did not renew
its lease on Morino’s house when it
expired last October. .

Morino said he will stay in Wells
even if his latest attempt to set up a
home business is denied.

I The doctor isn’t a coin collector,
but the old coins are worth more

He says his customers beneﬁt,
too, because the coins buy 20 times
their face value in bridgework, gold

About a dozen customers have
taken him up on his offer, including
a woman who paid $37 in old coins
for a new set of dentures which he
said would have cost $750 in new
currency.

Farmer Brown's Fertile ldea——PhiIadeIphia     

' By The Associated Press

OXFORD, Pa.—Joel Brown had
‘what he thought was a fertile idea
for the rolling Chester County
Farmland around here, land
detached from-most urban woes but
not too far from Philadelphia to
solve a sticky city problem.

The only hitch was that some
neighbors and officials, concerned
about factors other than
economies, didn’t agree.

So, farmer Brown’s plan to save
fertilizer costs by spraying the soil
with sewage sludge went down the
drain. 0

It all began about two years ago,
when Brown learned at a Penn State
seminar that he could save about

$600 —by letting Philadelphia _

workers spray 48,000 gallons of
liquid sludge on each of his 28
Lower Oxford Township acres, in

the southwestern part of the
county.‘

“It is a pretty good source of —

nitrogen and phosphorous, and
nitrogen is high-priced material,”
Brown said. “It would be free. The
farmers in the area were about half
and half, for it and against it.” - _

Philadelphia officials were for it’.
Because federal environmental laws
prohibit dumping, the city has until
December to stop taking sludge out

2 into the Atlantic. .
It already has halted ‘dumping —
about 80 percent of 140 ‘million .

pounds each year, which it now
sends to abandoned strip mines,‘
area gardens or isolated city-owned
land. ,

Brown allowed Philadelphia to

apply to the State Department of

Environmental Resources last
August for a permit to spray his

land. -
But opposition sprang from
Elkton, Md., just across the state

. line. That community gets drinking

water from Big Elk‘Creek, which is
fed in part by a stream that borders
Brown’s field. «. _ A _

' (Oxford officials wereconcerned
about contamination of ground-
water. They and many-of Brown’s
non-farmer neighbors formed a
pact called the Lower 11.

The Lower 11 and Elkton turned I

into a powerful lobby. A lawsuit
was threatened to stop the spraying;
So earlier“-this month, "Brown

Taking Action

The university administration received a message
at last Friday’s Black Action Society march and rally.
That message is that a portion of the university
community is unhappy with Pitt’s commitment to
blacks ‘and that the administration should do
something about it. _

The BAS protest centered around thetenure denial

.of Curtiss Porter, former chairperson and one of the

founders of Black Studies, funding foradditional.
Black Studies faculty members and programs, and
university hiring practices concerning black faculty in
other departments of the university. . -

In addition, the marchers called for an in-
vestigation of the campus police, concentrating in

part ‘on the alleged shooting of a blackyouth by the _'

campus police. '
Because so many students are up In arms con-

cerning these issues, it would be wise for the univer-

sity to take their demands seriously. _ ,

In terms of Curtiss Porter, the man’s tenure case
should be reviewed by Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenbergs’ superiors.

Porter is the spiritual backbone of the Black
Studies department and many students and faculty
members believe he is getting a raw deal. It seems
that PQrter’s supporters have a point. -

His resume, although lacking evidence of a-d.Oc-
torate, is quite impressive. He helped found the
Black Studies Department at Pitt at a time when that ~
academic field was in its infancy. He has published a
play, short stories, and poetry plus a document that

served as the foundation for building Pitt’s Black _

Studies department. He served as chairperson of the
department ‘from 1975-1978. He is also'popular with

Elie iﬂitt News: I

his students "as ' evidenced by the enrollment in his‘
classes, one of which tripled in two years. A

The other issues involved here are a bit more com-
plicated; perhaps too complicated to make a concrete
judgment about the situation.

However, so many students are unhappy that some

action by the university must be taken. The only op-

tion open to the administration is to set up a commit-
tee to study the Black Studies department.

The committee should be composed of faculty
members from Black Studies and other departments,
students who regularly are enrolled in the depart-
ments’s courses, ‘plus a representative of the
provost’s office. , ' - '

The committee should investigate the adequacy of
the department’s funding, the effectiveness of the
faculty, the relevance of the course offeringsgand the.
future direction the department should take. After
studying the department, the committee should
suggest‘any changes‘ to improve the departments
operations. ' ' -

Information concerning the BAS allegation that a

campus policeman was involved in the shooting of a —

black youth is still sketchy. Curt Graham, chief of
campus police, refused to comment on the allegation
except to say that a court case is pending. The univer-
sity should also investigate this incident and any

"other complaints involving the police.

Enough students are concerned about the situation
in Black Studies and other areas that prompt action
should be taken. The university administration’s
responsibility is to study the demands of the students
and investigate the issues in question. ,Once an inves-
tigation or study is completed, the findings should be
released for public examination. . , '

By KEITH BURRIS
Teaching Fellow/Political Science

I I Saturday, Jan. 19, 1980, was a

sad day- William 0. Douglas died.
The Republic lost not only a great
jurist and perhaps the -most
eloquent civil libertarian of our age

but a profoundly American figure

whose life and work evoked much

of our most noble myth and whose
character seemed to connect us with
a meaningful past. ' »

Douglas was born poor and spent
his childhood in the west. He
remained true to those roots and
affinities throughout his life. He
was a naturalist, adventurer and
traveller who is said to have

“a chore.” He loved openness and
space as much as he cared for the
particulars of nature. And true to
the ethos of the west, he made use

of the openness of society by’

moving through it as he pleased. It
was “equality? of opportunity” and
not some more basic_ or fundamen-

defended in all his work. ‘ V
Though he returned to his home

perhaps more of a westerner than a

111e Ultimate Ra

By NICK ARNETT

Regular readers know the name
Matt Miskie from the many letters
he writes to this paper. His recent
diatribes have often taken aim at
this°columnist. In one of his most
startling misquotations, Miskie
curiously launched himself into a
reasonable statement on the right of
Americans to demonstrate.

“Through the right to
assemble,” Miskie says, “namely
demonstrating, every group in the
United States is able to make their
feelings public. Public outcry,
through demonstrations, made
officials aware,
dramatically, of the nation’s dissen-
tion (sic) of the Vietnam war and as
a result brought that war to .a
quicker end.” '

Though simplistic, Miskie is
right. Despite his erroneous belief
that he was disagreeing with the col-
umn, he’s latched on to a bit of
truth. Unfortunately, we rarely see
organized peaceful demonstrations
at Pitt, despite hot issues—the
draft, Iran, new dorm rules and
sour milk.

IlI#I|III**#*#II¥****¥*IlHI*###

A short time ago, Pitt’s Black
Action Society held a rally on cam-
pus. Its goal was to show solidarity,
which it achieved. It also brought
problems to the attention of the ad-
ministration, other students and
media. Though the last may turn

out to be the most important, there’

was a greater value in having 500
students march and chant their way
across campus.

The march was carefully organiz-
ed. There were men with walkie-
talkies at each end, coordinating the
Chants were prepared
ahead of time, printed so each per-
son would have a copy. Someone
even had ‘the foresight to bring
along an electronic megaphone.

The march’s effect on the mar-
chers surpassed its informative
value to others. Those who" walked
along, clapping their hands,
shouting “Fire Up” became fired
up. They shook off the apathy
which seems to have infected this
campus.

Why is it the BAS rally was the
biggest, most organized and most
successful? This seems strange,-
considering that by its nature. it
represents the interests of a minori-
ty, unlike the draft and dorm rules.
Even at the height of anti-Iranian
sentiment, demonstrations were
sporadic and spontaneous. On the
draft question, no one seems to_ be
able to get people to agree to fight
or support it.

The nature of black leaders give
me some insight into their ability to
show solidarity. When the Rev.
Ben Chavis spoke to the rally on
Friday, he acted like many other
leaders. Unlike most, however, he
didn’t seem to stand apart from his
audience. Unlike a president ad-
dressing his country, Chavis stood
with his people—a part of them
which happened to be speaking.

Chavis’ speech was ‘
monologue, but a conversation with
his audience. He spoke; they
responded. It reminded me of a
film I once saw of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. in which a man
standing behind King said “yes sir”
each time King paused. It’s a style
used by many successful leaders—-
.John Kennedy, Adolf Hitler and
Jim Jones—good and bad.

Why is it that such a leader is
found in the black community at
Pitt, rather than other groups?
There seem to be a number of issues
which deserve such leadership.
Perhaps BAS deserves such a leader
more, but I,doubt it. War and per-

sonal freedom are "issues which af-

not a"

fect everyone, including blacks. It
seems more likely BAS inspires such
leadership.

I don’t believe Chavis could lead
any other group the way he led
BAS. It requires involvement by
the group, involvement which I
don’t see in other organizations.

I guess it comes back to apathy. I

clarity seem an anomaly in the
contemporary political age because
like those men of the 18th century,
he was a man of ideas and of con-
viction. As we enter the perhaps
still darkerage of the 1980s, we
have grown not only accustomed,
but nearly anesthetized, to politics
and politicians more content-less

-than consensual, more vacuous

than value-clarifying; the parties
bankrupt, the leaders interchange-
able and (especially in presidential
years) dazzling in their mediocrity;
the citizens convinced in large
percentages that they have been
betrayed and cannot make ‘a
difference. Against this trend stood
Douglas applying not just the

know, you don’t care about apathy.
At least, you appear apathetic on
the issue.

Last September, I produced a
series of stories for radio about
safety on campus. Everywhere I
went, I found the same answer to
my question on how safety could be

improved. I was told it was up to
students. Authorities—campus
housing officials, off-campus hous-
ing p.eople, policemen, and
firemen—agreed they were doing
enough. They said the rest was up
to students. _

Strangely enough, despite
criticism of the police and other

lly-Showing Concem for Apathy A

authorities, students agreed
Oakland could be much safer if
students took the trouble to work at
it. In the same breath, they said it
wasn’t likely to happen.

How about an anti-apathy rally?

I’m sure we can do well, especially
if BAS gets involved.

Death Great Loss to Republic

Constitution but the ideas and
principles of the constitution to
specific social problems. His
applications were often controver-
sial, as were his justifications of
them'(he once said he would rather
create a precedent than find one)
and as the various controversies,
which he had ignited, burned across
the dismal flatlands of American
politics, Douglas would merely
smile and keep on. ’

Another characteristic which
made him seem particularly out of
time, peculiarly American and
western in a distant evocative sense,
was his singularity. Though pro-
foundly political and insufferably

contentious, he seemed to be a
loner. On the court he was the great
dissenter who refused to try to
lobby .or buttonhole his colleagues.
He was reportedly distant and
cantankerous toward many of those
he worked with. Many of his
friends described him as “shy.” In
the limelight, whether it was when
he was being considered for the
residency or vice presidency, or
the victim of a congressional
‘campaign for his impeachment, he
seemed not only shy but quiet.
When interviewed by Eric Sevareid,
he seemed almost bored with
questions about himself and the

controversies that ‘surrounded him ‘*

but s'ngularly animated by
consideration of the Bill of Rights.

His personal life was an
embodiment of the fierce individ-
uality he championed in his
writings, whose politicalguardian is
the right to privacy and whose
social one is respect for diversity.

This extraordinary combination of‘
citizen and individualist, one who?

craves the public light yet guards
and depends upon his private

world, is one we know existed in the -

personalities of men like Jefferson
and Lincoln and yet have seldom

seen in the philistines who populate '

the politics of our own time. It is

the sense that we have lost touch‘

with much of our original national
covenant, that is betrayed in"the
noticeable absence and tragic loss
of such public men.

The Pitt News staff reemphasizes
its journalism excellence with each
issue of the. paper published. A
large part of this. excellence stems
from the coverage of Pitt athletics.
The diversity in the coverage of the
athletic events and the extra articles
involving the personal side of the
athlete makes the sports page a
highlight.

We are directly referring to the
coverage of women’s athletics,
specifically the women’s basketball
team. The support of The Pitt News
has made names such as Welsh and
Miklasevich (Pitt’s most recent
scholarship athletes) familiar to
every sports fan. To these two
freshman, who have made such a
lasting impression and brought add-
ed acclaim to the women’s team,
the flattery you belay is well-
deserved.

Bu we would like, if we may, to
bring to the attention of your staff
the “forgotten freshman.” On Jan.
12, 1980 in Queens, New York,
Lynn Love achieved a well-earned
starting line-up position. But this
long sought after goal lasted a mere
three minutes. Lynn came down on
her ankle tearing every ligament
and stretching every tendon. It is
not uncommon for an athlete to

show the Lady Lions

receive an injury so severe as to put
them out of competition for the re-
mainder of the season, but Lynn’s
case, we feel, is special.

The doctors told her that she
would spend four weeks in a cast
and six weeks in rehabilitation
before she. would be able to play
again. This weekend past ends week
number two of rehab, and Lynn
remarkably joined the team, in
uniform, when they met Rutgers.

While Welsh, Miklasevich and
the rest of the Pantherettes devote
an untiring three hours a day, six
days a week on strengthening their
already finely tuned game, Lynn
spends four to five hours a day,

determination and enthusiasm put‘
forth by Lynn. We know Lynn per-

honesty we can say that not once
did she give in to her disappoint-

most crippling injury an athlete can
experience: inactivity. But we were
not the only ones to benefit by

tant smiles, support and encourage-
ment from this special athlete.
Physically, mentally and emo-
tionally, Lynn was put through a
terrible strain. Because of her
strength she came out on top, so
much so as to be a strength to
others. The entire women’s basket-
ball team and coaches, Balthaser,
Bolla and Schlegel, have put forth a
very strong effort in producing a
winning season, but Lynn Love has
gone steps beyond this level of
-achievement. To the staff of The
Pitt News Lynn Love may have
been forgotten, but in the hearts of
those who are close to her, Lynn is
always in our starting line-up.

Overcoming
Obstacles

One of the~departments at Pitt
which I feel _has effectively over-
come more administrative and
developmental obstacles than most
is the Black Studies department,
The department still goes on
stronger today because of the

students, for whom the school sup'- .

posedly functions. Black Studies

professor Curtiss Porter’s position
is at the hands of the administra-
tion. This may be the last time he
has to deal with them if it is up to
Dean Rosenberg.

Porter is a key to the department.
He has largely- developed the
discipline as well as administrating
and teaching for the department.
He has devoted himself fully to the
finding of answers concerning the
department. Such as what Black
Studies should be and how can
those concepts be implemented in
the course plans. When these ques-
tions were answered Curtiss then

put his ‘creative powers into the

classroom through his teaching.
Meanwhile he still was in an ad-
ministrative position planning for
future development. All this was
done without reference to previous
black ‘studies programs and their
administrators—there was none.
pTen years of ongoing commit-
ment to the Black Studies depart-
ment have all been stamped
creditless by Dean Rosenberg’s
decision of tenure denial for Cur-
tiss Porter. If the appeal is a failure
the injustice will be major. The
department itself will lose out
of a principle staff member, which
will reduce the input and emphassis

that keeps the department alive and ’

growing.

Students studying Black Studies
will be denied backing of a strong
department and also the ‘-inspiration
of Curtiss Porter and all his efforts
for the ‘advancement of students.

Student and faculty support of
Porter is being disregarded by
Rosenberg. Curtiss Porter’s ac-
complishments are being negatively
disrgarded by Rosenberg. How can
all this happen? It has happened at
the hands of an administration that
is running the school for themselves
despite protest. They are making
their own rules stopping freedom of

students to pursue their own in- .

terests. Stopping the Black Studies
department from advancing. Stop-
ping Curtiss Porter from bringing
his talents to the department and to
the students. But how can all this

happen when it is the students who‘

pay the bills? Are we paying the

' University to ‘tell us what we can

and cannot learn, who we can and

cannot learn from? The system is V

taking over at the cost of those they

are trying to control, at the cost of _

the University who can’t run

   Pitt Starts Great in

By MARIA S_CIULLO'.

Three was a charm for Pitt last
night as the Panthers came from
behind to eliminate George
Washington _in the opening round
of the. Eastern Eight basketball
tournament, 77-68. _,

The win-was the third for_’Pitt in
as many years against the Colonials
'1-I‘: opening roundcompetition. In
this year’s game, no one was more
charming to the 3,280 fans in atten-
dance that Panther center Sam
Clancy. ,

The Pitt junior‘ played one of his
best all-around-9 games of the
season, registering 23 points, 12 re-
bounds, two blocked shots and a
pair of steals. Among his more in-
teresting field goals last night were a
one-handed behind—the-head alley-
oop and a one"-handed -tip-in stuff
that brought his—team within strik-
ing distance after Pitt had earlier
fallen behind by 11. ' ‘

9 “I just played hard. _' It was an
[important league game,”- said Clan-
cy. “The Duke‘ game was the only
other game ‘I thought about
(beforehand) for more than two
days.” V

Clancy, who made 10' of _l4 field
‘goal attempts, was followed by
Sammie Ellis (16), Carlton Never-
son,(14) and Dwayne Wallace (10)
in the Pitt scoring column. Ellis
also collected nine rebounds. GW
was greatly supported. by the offen-
sive efforts of seniors Mike Zagardo

‘ and Brian Magid; each had 21
‘points. ’

As usual, the Panthers came out
cold in the first five minutes of the
game-, but trailed by only two at in-
termission, 36;,-34. '

“This is the-12th game in the last

-four weeks,we’ve- been "down by a
large margin,” said Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich-. “We-’ve* talked about it,
but after winning maybe it would be
best if we didn’t.” ,

“We were fundamentally sound
tonight,” he continued- “We were
careful and moved the ball around
well in the second half, and that’s

. our bread and butter.”
For the -first time- in a'very long

Sammie EIIis‘,.,I9.oking‘ for

 

while, the Panthers were steady in
their free throw shooting. By suc-
cessfully completing 23 of 28, at-
tempts at the line, Pitt maintained,
a carefully-built six-to’-eight point
lead down the final five-minute
stretch. , — -

Pitt employed a hustling base-
line-to—baseline defense that pro-
duced .19 Colonial turnovers, and
was content ‘to; concede the long
outside shot. This, however, was
.much to GW’s Magid’s liking and
he repeatedly took. advantage of the
situation. The great majority of his-
points were scored on long bombs.
“It’s not part of our defense to
guard someone that far out there,”
explained Pitt assistant coach Cleve

Edwards. “If he makes them from‘

out there, then he’s supposed to
beat you.” I ‘

Last night, however, no one was
supposed to beat the favored Pan-
thers. Quite obviously, no one did.
Not even themselves.

Pitt News Staff Writer
As ‘time goes on, bad habits

become harder to ' shake.’ " ‘George. -

Washington University found that
out last night, as for the third
straight year it lost to Pitt in the

opening round of the Eastern Eight _

Tournament. After succombing in
‘I978 by three points and last year
by five, this season's Colonial team
lost by nine. Things appear to be
getting no better.

' For.GW coach Bob Tallent, the
question was not of ‘habits; but of
poor officiating. , '

“We must be the most aggressive
team in the country,” he said, “We
play a zone and get two guys out
with fouls, and they playa. man to
man and get no fouls.

“Tim Grugurich must be the best
defensive coach in the nation,” "he
added. “His players go for the ball
on “every play and never get called
‘for it. l’ve never seen any team
with more steals than Pitt.”

‘When asked whether Pitt"s post
seasonr dominace over his team
meant anything to the players prior
to the game, Tallant countered, “I
sure hope it didn’t. I don’t thinkit
makes any difference, who we lose
to. A loss is "a loss. Some of these

;,. .

,..—-...—«g - :3

guys weren’t even around‘ two years

ago. I don’t believe in jinxs.” .
Pitt’s Carlton Neverson felt dif-
ferently. ’
“Whenever a team starts beating
a team regularly, the squad has to
figure that you’ve got. to win
sometime,” he said, “‘so you just go
. out there with a little more intensity
because you’ve got to come out of it

sometime. GW played with a lot of .

intensity tonight.”
After voicing his unhappiness

over the refereeing coach Tallent:

praised the Panthers and Sam Clan-
cy. '

“_We worked for two days on
blocking out Sam Clancy, but when
he’s bearing down he’s unstop-

p_able,”, Tallent said. ,“If he played ,

on a bad shooting team, he’d have
about "15 offensive rebounds a
game.’_‘ “With Clancy and the
home crowd,” the losing coach, ad-
ded, “Pitt should be the logical
favorite to win the tournament.”

For George Washington, it has

been a good season, but a short
one;

“Everybody thought a that after
'our first four games _’ we would
fold,’-’,Tallent said. “I’m satisified
with our season. We had-a winning

V record and played". tough.”

 

rm I-‘or GW 

script has been all too similar for
the George Washington Colonials,
and all too predictable. For the
school located in the nation's
capital, playing in Pittsburgh is like
a three year hangover. ‘

haswhat it takes to make it in the

American. And for local fans, he’s
from neaby Mount Lebanon. In
fact, he’s announced before all
Spirit home games as being Pitts-

    Booterﬂow Starsin Mist for

burgh’s very own.
The curly haired, 20-year old

gave up his eligibility at the Univer- .

sity 'of Pittsburgh to play profes-
sional soccer this past summer with
the Pennsylvania Stoners of the
American Soccer League. And, just
as with other young players, like
David Brcic and Ricky _ Davis,
things are going just fine for
O’Hara. In fact, the words is better
than fine-—they’re tremendous.
O’Hara was first exposed to soc-
cer when he spent three years of his
young life in England. From the
ages of 9-12 his pastime was soccer.
“I watched soccer and read about
it,” said O’hara. “I was totally ex-
posed to it while I lived in

‘ England. ” .

/After moving back to the states,
O’Hara put in some very fulfilling

years as a member of WPIAL_

powerhouse Mount Lebanon High

O’Hara was "named all-state and
came ‘in as close second in the

balloting for the WPIAL player of
the year-.
After high school, O’Hara spent

two years playing at Pitt where he‘

again was given honors both
seasons by being named to» the
Western Pennsylvania In-
terscholastic Soccer Conference all-
star team.

A new _challenge arose for
O’Hara shortly after his sophomore
year at Pitt. He was given the op-
portunity to try out for the Stoners,
which woulclgmean the terminating
of ' his collegiated eligibility. His

8 choice "turned out to be a smart
decision.

“This represented a new
challenge-for me,” said O’Hara, “a
chance to play with and against bet-

‘ ter players. I did the thing that
most anyone my age with that type
of opportunity would do. It’s not

the first time ,and it won’t be the .

» last.” ..
The Stoners became a learning
experience, for theyoung O’Hara.

   

PITT tmrou PROGRAM COUNCIL
' ,PnEsENTs.‘

He started most every game for the
Stoners in the midfield, the position
that he knew best. He became a
great asset for the Pennsylvania
team, which finished theseason as

the number two team in the Eastern ‘

Division of the ASL.

Now, with the Spirit, O’Hara
shares oneof two defensive lines
with Dave MacKenzie. Under the
instruction of head coach Len
Bilous, MacKenzie and O’Hara
work together, as do Clive Charles
and Adrian Webster.’

“I ‘really have a great deal of
respect for Len,” said ‘O’Hara of
the man who‘has led the Spirit to an
MISL record for consecutive wins.
“There is a good rapport between
the coaches and the players. He
listens to" us and weighs’ our
thoughts with his thoughts and

‘together we find a solution,

something that we. all agree upon.”~

' Pitt News Staff Writer
With ‘Eastern championships
‘right around the corner, the Pitt
men’s swim team is into a rough

  ’ _‘ .:.

 training period. Leading the divers

into that competition will be junior
‘Pat Greenwell, an all-America from

_Saltsberg, Pa. They will be going in

as the favorites which may add a lit-

‘tle more pressure on them.

“Being in the favorite’s role adds

. a little more pressure to us but it

shouldn’t have any affect and we’ll
do well,” Greenwell said.

Pat started swimming at age six
but his parents prevented him from
diving until he was 12. Greenwell is

-originally from Valrico, Fla. and it

was at a summer camp there that he
got his interest in diving.

' v .27‘.

..i..... ..~..... um.     s........gs.....

“At the diving camp, there were
many Olympic hopefuls and wat-
ching them was exciting,”
Greenwell said.

Pat spent his first two years of
high school in Valrico, before mov-
ing to Saltsberg and attending Kiski
Prep in his junior and senior years.

Pat feels that his best year during
his high school career was when he
was in tenth grade. Apparently,
Florida coaches felt the same
because he was recruited out of
Kiski Prep. by the University of
Florida, Gainsville University,
University of Miami, as well as Pitt.
However, the offers weren’t enough
to woo him back to Florida.

“I came to Pitt primarily due to
recruiting reasons. The schools in
Florida ‘didn’t seem to want me as

much as Pitt. They may have felt
that I wouldn’t develop as I have. I
was also impresed with the coaches
here and their all-around en-
thusiasm. ” Greenwell said.

This season has gone well for
6-foot, 145 pound Greenwell. It’s
been a lot of work with training
ranging from about 2 hours in the
afternoon and about 3 more hours
in the evening. -

“I feel that my best meet this year
was at Penn State about four weeks
ago. I was pleased with my perfor-
mance against a tough Penn State
team. Also, the opening meet here
against Ohio State, when I won the
one-meter event, was probably my
second best effort,” Greenwell
said.

Pat has had some close calls in

Cissy Wilbom Jumps Info Easterns

By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Cissy Wilbom is an individual
who is blessed with multiple talents.
The Pantherette track team member
can run fast, jump great distances,
and at the same time, hold the title
of team philosopher. /Aside from
being a great athlete,‘ Wilbom is

.very dedicated to learning more

about her sport of high jumping

* and maintaining a positive attitude

about life.

' It all started when Wilbom was a
sophomore at Penn Hills High
School at age 15. She long-jumped
her way to the state ﬁnals but
discontinued jumping afterwards.
She decided to spend more time on
running sprint events since speed
was also one of her great attributes.
It was during her junior year that

'5 she reached her peak.

“I had been running seriously
since I was 14,” said Wilbom. I
really wanted to run and I reached

 my personal bests in 11th and 12th
, grade.”

From there, it was on to college
for Wilborn and Pitt was just the

 place for a talented trackster to fur-
" ther pursue a career.

_ “Pitt was very close and I could
remain near my family,” said
Wilbom. “I could go to school and
still be an athlete. My mind was
made up and I wouldn’t have gone
anywhere else.”

Wilbom’s freshman year at Pitt
was one to remember. Not all
athletes can achieve success as early

as shedid in their careers. After a
two-year layoff from the long jump
track, Wilborn started again and in
the process, set indoor and outdoor
records. She was also a member of
two record relays, one" of which
went on to nationals, and was-con-
sidcred the best in the East.

Wilbom looks back on her first
year here as one which was a great
learning experience.

“AH of the girls became good
friends and have continued to be
like one big family. We get along
well and do a lot of things‘
together.”

Wilborn has also kept a close
relationship with Pantherette head
coach Alfreeda Goff.

“As a coach, she is very positive,
and as an athlete she pushes you as
much as she thinks you can
handle,” she said. “She is a very
good coach and considering the
hard times we’ve had, she has never
let it effect her being coach. For-
tunately, it hasn’t effected us either.
She is a positive person and we can
sit down and have enjoyable con-
versations because she is so easy to
get along with. She doesn’t expect
any more from you than you can
give.”

When asked what her highpoints
at Pitt have been, Wilborn said, “I
really don’t think I‘ have reached
one yet. If I did, it would have been
my freshman year because I learned

‘so much. But I believe that every

year is a high point.”
Wilborn’s first ambition is to

graduate and receive a degree in
computer science.

“For my next two years, I’m go-
ing to give 100 percent in the
classroom and on the track. I hope
to do both successfully. Myrun-
ning will end at Pitt but I’ve en-
joyed myself thoroughly while
here.”

Wilborn had this to say when
asked about a possible chance at a
tryout for the 1984 Summer Olym-

the past when he hasn’t hit a dive
just right. There have been several
occasions when he has hit the board

on his way down, once even hitting .

his head. Although he wasn’t
injured seriously, it did shake him
up a bit. Despite that, he has never
.had any fear of diving, which is
essential to the sport.

Greenwell had an embarrassing
moment this year, when he lost to
his brother at the Penn State meet.

“He’s (Pat’s brother) a freshman
this year at Penn State and I
finished second to him off the one-
meter board. I was a little
embarrassed, ” Greenwell confided.

Pat’s best di' e is a reverse two-
and-a-half off ' ne one-meter board.
The dive which gives him the most
trouble is his front three-and-a-half

 

 

off the same height. This was the

dive during which he hit his head on:

.the board, he said.

After easterns will be a meet at
Penn State which will be the final
competition before nationals. Last
year at nationals, Greenwell
finished 13th, and he is looking for
a higher finish this time around. He
looks forward to being all-America
again.

The team has done a lot of
traveling and to Pat, it’s great.

“Traveling all around the
country and the world is really fun.
All thetrips are great,” said Pat.

§\_ —

So, when all the traveling and
competition‘ is done, Pitt’s men
swimmers, ‘and Pat Greenwell,
could once again be on top.

With Positive Attitude

pics.

“It would take an awful lot of
hard work. I would have to take
long jumping very seriously. With
the proper coaching and with what I
know, I think I would do really
well. It is something one dreams
about. If you‘try hard and get the
opportunity, it’s great. If I never
do, I’m satisfied with what ’I’ve
had.” - ’

Wilborn’s ambitions after college

are to work and at one point in life,
participate in coaching a women’s
track team. She said she’ll always
be an athlete.

“At this time, our non-revenue
sports team needs a lot of support.
If everyone can come up and see
our meets, especially our big one in
May (outdoor Regionals May 3-4),
it would be great. We've come a
long way and still have a long way
to go.’ It would really help us to
have some support.” ‘ V

Mountaineer Fans Big Factor in Win

By The Associated Press
The West Virgina Mountaineers

I came here with a fired up bunch a

fans, their own pep band and a
basketball team that believed in
itself.

And they went home celebrating
a 95-87 upset victory over Duquesne
Tuesday night in the first round of
the Eastern- Eight College basket-
ball playoffs.

“I came in, and I thought I was
in the ' West Virginia -Coliseum
again,” Duquesne Coach Mike Rice
admitted after the loss on the home
court of the Dukes. I

“It seemed like we had more of
our fans here than they did,” said
West Virginia guard Lowes Moore,

who had 26 points on a night when

the other Mountaineer guard, Joe _

Fryz, totalled 25. 2,.

_“At least our fans were more
boisterous than theirs. It was a big
help,” added Moore. 5'

Indeed, the crowd of 5,056 ap-
peared to include about one-third

Mountaineer rooters. And the
West. Virginia fans, dominated
vocally—with help from a band
that played near the Mountaineer
bench. .
“Before the game I got_ overly
upset at the location of the band.
But the band didn’t win the game,”
said Rice, whose team lost despite
32 points by senior guard B.B.
Flenory. ' ’

WASHINGTON - To the sound
of ‘ the- Marine Band‘ playing the
Olympic 0 theme, -the U.S. Winter

President Carter Monday as
“modern~day American heroes.”

“This has been a wonderful week
for our country,’’‘ Carter said in
ceremonies at the White House.

The Olympic team was flown to .

Andrews Air Force Base Monday
morning, the day after the-eonclu-

port by thousands who braved wet.‘

From the air base, the athletes

Mondale, wife of, the vice president,
Carter ‘shook hands with the
athletes as they paraded up the steps
with the Marine Band playing in the
background. .

He gave a big hug to Eric Heiden,
the speed skater who earned a
record five gold medals. He «also
hugged Linda Fratianne, a silver

The session was triumphant, but
Carter alsotold the athletes he is
standing firm on his request that the
Americans boycott the Summer
