I Bueing Set

To Perform

Wednesday

(Continued From. Page 1)

under the patronage of the Arts
Program of the Association of

American College.

In Jan., 1957, she ‘marked her
Pittsburgh debut by appearing
with'the Griller String Quartet.

In Apr. 1957, she participated
as contralto soloist in the per-
formance of Honneger’s “King
David” by the Oratorio Society
of New York.

Mrs. Bue'ing has had extensive
singing experience in Europe, do-
in_g oratorio work with leading
orchestras throughout Western
Germany. Her main recitals took
place in Wiesbaden, Nurmberg,
Bamberg,_ Munich and Essen.

One Highlight

One of the highlights of her
singing performances was as con-
tralto soloist in “St. Matthew’s
Passion” in Nurgnberg, with the
Bamberg Symphony.

Some other of her American ap-
pearances include: concert work
in New‘ York City and Garden
City, New York; oratorio work at
Duke University, Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.

She also appeared at Denni-
son University; a program given
entirely in French for Poetry
Reading at Pitt; and a per-
formance at the 1956 Christmas
Party for the Modern Languages

tionship aids both the student and
the teacher, by effecting a more
relaxed atmosphere in which to
learn.

Carbide I President Announces

Scholarships For Engineering

Morse G. Dial, president of the Union Carbide Corpora-
tion, has announced the establishment of 268 four-year en-

gineering scholarships at 48 co
and universities.

lleges, technological institutes

These include the University of Pittsburgh School of En-

gineering, .The new engineeri

ng scholarships provide full

tuition for four years of under—¢
graduate study and allowances for
necessary fees as well as an anu-
nual grant to the college.

The scholarships, which go
into effect this fall, will be
awarded and administered by
the individual colleges. The
scholarships were established to
enable more students who de-
sire an engineering career to ob-
tain a college education.

Engineering colleges and uni-
versities may be provided “greater
ﬁnancial assistance” in this way.
The four—year scholarship program
takes the place of a previous schol-
arship plan, which provided 73
senior-year scholarships, now dis-
continued.

The new scholarships, how-
ever, are in addition to the Un-
ion Carbide Four-Year Scholar-
ship Plan, announced in 1952,
and which now covers 392 schol-
orships at 49 institutions of
‘higher learning.

The corporation also supports
state and regional associations of
private colleges.

. Here To Visit

With Librarian

United States Congressman,
James Fulton, recently visit-
ed, the University of Pitts-
burgh to' meet Miss Helen
Hoch of Switzerland for whom
he expedited entry to the
United States.

Miss Hoch catalogues the ex-
tensive array of foreign publica-
tions in the Pitt library.

Mr. Fulton acted at the re-
pquest of Miss Lorena Gerloch,
head librarian, to cut red tape
for Miss Hoch. He cut the time
for entry into the U.S. from 18
to about four months by inter-
ceding with immigration au-
thorities and the U.S. Employ-
ment Office.

Miss Hoch was recommended
for the position by Miss Hope
Reeder, head cataloguer at the
United Nations library in Gen-
eva, Switzerland. She can speak

French, German, Italian, and Eng-
lish.

lChem Professor Says 
Drugs Still Controversy:

“Modern tranquilizing drugs, used and misused to re- _
lieve mental tension, are still the subject of considerable
controversy,” according to Dr.

Robert Levine‘, associate pro-

Authorities are concerned about public ignorance of the

complex organic compounds.

these drugs
without regard to their doctor’s
directions, and such improper use
can be dangerous.

Dr. Levine said, “We must be
especially cautious in using
tranquilizers because we still
know so little about them. we?‘
do not pretend that they are a
cure for mental illness, and they
may have side eﬁects, such as
drowsiness. However, by their
use mental patients are made
more susceptible to therapy.”

Miltown, which is also called
Equinil, is a popular commercial
preparation that can lessen physi-
cal etfects of the common psycho-
neuroses by relaxing muscles and
decseasing anxiety, Dr. Levine

pointed out.

Made from meprobamate, Mil-
town was first produced in 1950.
The drug reached the market in
1955 after ﬁve years of careful
research by doctors and chemists.
Meprobamate was derived from
mephenesin,, , the original tran-
quilizing chemical. 

Mephenesin was being used)
as a penicillin preservative in
1936, when British scientists
discovered that mice, treated
with penicillin with the me-
phenesin added, were doped
temporarily.

This discovery initiated re-
search that nineteen years later
resulted in replacement of bar-
biturates as tension easers.

Last month we got the follow-
ing letter:

mooniug in Palm Beach today
if it wasn’t for your so-called
smart ideas. Go shoot yourselves
in your ulcers. Respectfully
yours, Dorothea J omes.

We tracked down the story
behind it and found that Miss
J omes worked a steam-iron at
the Acme Laundry in Eastpox,
N. J . Last year, while ironing
a shirt belonging to Latindry
Mark x428Fy, she had noticed
a small piece of paper pro-

. truding from the slot on the
collar. Curious, she pulled it
out and read: “Whoever you
are, I love the way you press
my shirts. I think I may love
you too. Interested?” She
blushed, but daringly wrote
her answer —— “Interested,
sorta,” and slipped it in the
collar-slot.‘Ten days later came
another shirt from x428Fy
and, sure enough, another
note: “If you can cook like you

 

_LOVE IN THE LAUNDRY

can write I may be smitten
beyond recall. Fascinated?”
This time she almost swooned,
and wrote back, “Wow, am I!”
Anyhow, note followed. hot
note and Miss Jomes began
thinking of turning in her
steam iron for a marriage man-
ual. Until one day tragedy
struck. x428Fy’s shirts arrived
as usual, but when Miss J omes
turned to the slot shefound
it sewn-up. Frantic, she tried
to rip it open. No luck. She
could feel something thin in-
side, but she couldn't get to
it. And that’s how it’s been
ever since!

You see, x428Fy had switch-
ed to slotless Van Heusen
Collarite shirts—:with sewn-in
stays.’ You should, too! These
micro—thin stays can’t get lost,
keep your collar flat, and
launder with your shirt! Spec.
ify Collarite next time.

And don’t feel bad about
Miss J omes. She took her un-
happiness out in hard work
and was promoted to assistant
manager. We expect a thank.

Where Does lt Encl? . . .

Giant Unionisrn   .

By Harold Jacobs

Has labor’s era of strong unionism reached its

, point of diminishing returns?

The question posed is extremely vital today with
labor’s forcing demands for a closed shop and,

.more particularly, with the mass transit strike in

Pittsburgh. -

No denial can be made of the labor movement’s
accomplishments since the Wag- \
ner Act -gave workers an ex— ‘
plicit right to collective bargain-
ing. In counteracting manage-
ment’s severe and often unscrup-
ulous treatment of the worker,
in raising the laborers’ wages, :
working conditions, and retire-
ment benefits, and in general
leading employees to a phenom-
enal living standard, the unions
must be commended without
qualification.

Prominence on Scene

Their prominence on the American scene has

given them a position of power which was bound

-

   

to lead to normal abuses. As all groups which are’

entrusted with vast powers and responsibilities,
the labor movement
American public for close scrutiny. The questions
that such an examination must now resolve are
two: Have the normal abuses become abnormal‘?
Has the power, labor leaders have enjoyed, gone
to their heads?

Senator McClelland’s Rackets Committee has
drawn the attention of responsible citizens to some
very revealing facts. There has been collusion be-
tween some Tearnster oﬂicials and members of
management. Certain pension funds have been ran-
sacked by unprincipled “heroes” of labor’s hier-
archy. Gangster tactics have been used against op-
ponents who would not toe the line. Questionable
financial dealings have bolstered the private hold-
ings of top leaders. A static conformity has seeped
into the rank-and-ﬁle. Without surprise, the com-
mittee’s probe has met stiff resistance. There is

little doubt that the unions, with almost unlimited»

An Appreciated Effort . .. .

“Bus" Worked Well

is now placed before the,

resources at its command,lhas become the best
practicioner of loophole law.,

Obvious Conclusion

This sincere attack on giant unionism directs the
writer to some obvious conclusions:

(1) Unions have not deserved~the right to addi-
tional power. Therefore, the closed shop should be
resisted, and the Right-to-Work laws, which have
proved effective in several states, should be en-
couraged. “ .

(2), The union leaders should reassess their posi-
tion and strive to make their unions more attrac-
tive, emphasizing to the worker voluntary mem-
bership rather than coercive membership.

(3) An internal housecleaning should be initiated 

to weed out undesirable elements.

(4) Union bargainers, and management as well,
should -try to grasp the entire American economic
scene and make their demands more reasonable and
more realistic. A necessary requisite to‘ this con-
clusion is the elimination of the bitter climate that
often typiﬁes labor-management sessions.

This last suggestion leads directly to our local
dilemma, the railways strike. Original demands of
the Electric Railways and Motor Coach Employees

.union called for a thirty-nine cent per hour raise

in addition to important fringe benefits. This en-
trenched position has not substantially altered since
the stubborn negotiators began seeing each other.

To be extremely blunt, these demands are simply
ridiculous. The thirty-six cents per hour raise alone
approaches the amount that some workers receive

in total wages per hour. In Atlantic City this\_
summer the writer observed parking-lot attendants ‘

who received only forty-ﬁve cents per hour for
work that required more skill and responsibility
than the job of streetcar motorman calls for.
While this fact alone is not enough to deny the
railways union their unreasonable demands, it
does call startling attention to the problem. Further-
more, it might serve as a springboard to an inquiry
that would ﬁnd the unions guilty of excessive
power. The giant must be knocked down a notch or
two.

(Editor’s Note: Nori Amsel
is the, winner» of the 19557
Writers Scholarship to the
University. She has had her
.work, a play, published in the
National Scholastic Magazine.
She has reviewed the Pitt
Players’ production at the in-
vitation of the editor.) ’

The Pitt Player’s performance
of “Bus Stop” produced an ex-
tremely humorous, although not
completely ﬂawless effect. The
play began at a mediocre pitch,
but rose to a delightful one with
the electric entrance of Nick

Belich, who played the arrogant‘

cowboy, Bo Decker

When Belich bounced into the
bus stop, Grace’s Diner, the
whole audience bounced‘ with
him—and loved every minute of
it. His exuberant and realistic
acting started the play moving at
a fast pace which continued to
the very end.

It was fascinating to watch Bo
Decker, the ranch hand who
couldn’t understand-how any girl
could resist him, change his
character from comic wildness
to remorseful pathos during the
course of the three acts;

Myrna Granowitz as Cherie,
the night club singer, proved
herself an extremely capable
comedienne, yet somehow failed
to give her part enough of the
glamor that was needed. She was
her best in scenes like the one
where she stood on the table
singing “That Old Black Magic”
and performing various‘ gyra-
tions.

In the last scene, however, her

‘playing gave a softened effect

with more variety.

Another major contributor to
the play’s success was Jay Dan-
try as Dr. Lyman, the drunken
ex-college professor with an eye
for pretty P" young girls. -As he
ﬂoated around with a bottle in

~his hand, reciting the balcony
scene -from A Romeo and :«Juliet,l- « ~

— ~ the audience went into »n’ear’~hys- ~
téria. Dantry was equallyskill-»

 

    
 

ful at bringing out the inner
tragedy of Dr. Lyman’s charac-
ter, as when the balcony scene
caused him to collapse with
drunken remorse. After having
been told by another character
about how smart he is, Dantry’s
closing speech of “Oh, I’m terri-
bly smart. Wouldn’t it be nice to
have been intelligent?” received
the first of(the audience’s many
ﬁnal ovations. A

In‘!-imafe’,Arena

Although the arena style thea-
ter placed the audience on a
more intimate basis with the
actors,‘ “Bus Stop” would have
gone over better were it done on
the conventional, pic~ture—frame
stage that it was originally de-

signed for. It was a problem for

anybody not sitting in the ﬁrst
row to get a clear view of the
performers. _

The most effective arena plays,
being those expressly written for
that purpose, are arranged so as
to make the audience feel more
a part of them. “Bus Stop” was
really in need of the picturesque
ﬂavor of a stage. If costumes,
make-up and actors‘ were placed
in a world farther away from
us, they would have been funnier
and more enjoyable. ‘ _

Rheda Myers, who played the

young waitress, lacked the proper ‘

conviction and vivaciousness that
her part required. She managed
to get across the impression of a

. naive high school girl whose hero

worshipped a degenerate ex-pro-
fessor and yet she wasn’t quite
convincing enough. She cap-
tured the girl, Elma Duckworth’s
sweetness without fully escap-
ing into her part and really be-
coming Elma Duckworth.

scene was when he strummed his
guitar and sang “The Ballad of

ful voice. lDick Grove was ade-
quately sly as Carl, the bus
driver who found stranded buses
rather enjoyable.

Al Stewart was exceptionally
ﬁne as the dynamic young sheriff.
His performance added a re-
freshing quality when the play
needed one most.

“Bus Stop” was expertly di-

analysis, the actors and techni-
cal crews, did exceptionally well.
The Pitt Player’s performance of
“Bus Stop” was a play worth
seeing, a play that captured the
essence of what is really theater.

By LINDA KOHL
When the 1957 Pitt Chest campaign rolls around in full
force during the week of Nov. 11 to 15, many Pitt students
may wonder exactly for what kind of services their contri-

butions are going.

Pitt Chest allocates its intake to three main areas: Pitt
.,;~_,(students, other students, and charities such as the United

5 ‘Fund. Perhaps the area designated¢

for Pitt Students may be of
greatest interest to the Pitt stu-
dent body:

Adopted Project

About six years ago Men’s
Council adopted for a project the
Men’s Loan Fund for emergency,
short-term purposes.
The Men’s Loan Fund derives
about 50 percent of its capital
from the Pitt Chest.

Any full-time male undergrad-
uate or graduate in need of ﬁnan-
cial assistance is eligible to re-
ceive loans up to a maximum of
$200 a year at the rate of two per
cent. For example, an emergency
loan of $100 would require an in-

5.5/terest payment of two dollars for

‘ the year. Any loan must be repaid
within a year.

Jack I-Iardman, Director of
Men’s Loan Fund, has express-
ed the hope that students will
contribute generously to the Pitt
Chest since the Men’s Loan
Fund is down to less than $200.
The fund started out the year
1956-’57 with approximately
$3000 available.

Many students may not realize
the many and diverse uses for
which this money goes. The‘ ap-
plication form informs the stu-
dent that “Loans are made for
educational purposes only," but

__vthe interpretation of “Education-

al” is quite a broad one.
Cites Example

Mr. Hardman cites many ex-
amples of how this fund is used.
In addition to paying for tuition,
the money has proved useful to
needy Pitt students for buying
tuxedoes for the Christmas dance
and to ﬁnance trips to such places
as New York for the United
Nations excursion sponsored last
year by the YM-YWCA.

This fund was available to Pitt
students who wished to make the
recent trip to West Point for the
Pitt’-Army game but were unable
to “pay the expenses themselves.

 Other examples come under

the heading of student supplies:
ROTC uniforms and books. En-
gineering students have availed
themselves ofgthis aid for the
latter category because of the
many and costly supplies they
require. "

Many veterans take advantage
of this service to meet tuition
deadlines and to tide them over

their government checks
Five Students

The situation of ﬁve students at
Pitt from Columbia, South Amer-
ica, is offered as an -examp1e'by
Hardman. Because, of a_ mix-up
in payments from the government
of their native country, tffey were
unable to meet their tuition ex-
penses. Each was awarded $100
until the needed funds reached‘
them. _ -

Another case on record con-
cerns the recent railways strike
in Pittsburgh. A student was re-
cently the recipient of a $5 loan
so that he could travel to‘ his
home in Mount Lebanon to re-
ceive his regular allowance from
his parents.

Women students at Pitt are
not forgotten when loans are
awarded for emergency pur-
poses. Administrator for the
Women, Savina S. Skewis.

Organized along the same lines
as the Men’s Loan Fund, the W0-
men’s Loan Fund differs in that
no interest is charged unless the
loan is 'very much overdue and
no maximum sum is stipulated;
the amount loaned varies with
the individual, '

Fund Used

The Women’s Loan Fund has
been used extensively as the ac-
cumulation of records in Miss
Skewis’ office will testify.

Perhaps the most typical appli-
cation is requested by a woman
student who after having worked
for her ﬁrst three years at Pitt
desires to spend her last year
experiencing more freely in all
phases of University life.

Many women use their loans
for, purposes" such as sorority
fees and room and board in ad-
dition to the usual reason of
assistance in payment of tuition.

Both Miss Skewis and Hard-
man emphasize the importance of
the contributions of Pitt Chest to

these loan funds, and they urge
that students contribute to their
best ability during the Pitt Chest
drive. -

‘SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1

Though this column is intended to be a source of inno-
cent merriment for all sexes and not to concern itself with
weighty matters, I have asked my sponsors, the makers
of Marlboro, whether I might not, from time to time,
use this space for a short lesson in science. “Makers,” I
said to them, “might I not, from time to time, use this
space for a short lesson in science?”

They agreed with many a kindly smile, the makers of
Marlbo1'o, for they are the most agreeable of men. Their
benevolence is due in no small measure to the cigarc-ttes
they smoke, for Marlboro is a cigarette to soothe the most
savage of breasts. 1 refer not only to the ﬂavor which, as
everyone knows, is a delight; to the palate, but also to
the Marlboro container. Here is no fiendisbly contrived
device to fray the fingernails and rasp the nerves; here,
instead, is a ﬁip—t:op box ‘that opens like a charm, and
inside you ﬁnd a handy red tape to lift out the cigarettes
with ease and dispatch. Add to all this the best ﬁlter ever
made, and you can see that you get a lot to like.

Let us begin our series of science lessons with chemis-
try. It is ﬁtting that chemistry should be the ﬁrst, for it
is the oldest of sciences, having been discovered by Ben-
jamin Fraiikliii in 468 B.C. when an apple fell on his head
while he was shooting the breeze with Pythagoras one

V day outside the Acropolis. (The reason they were ouitside

the Acropolis and not inside was that Pythagoras had been
thrown out for drawing right triangles all over the walls.)
/. rr  F " '

. .5

P They had several meetings outside the Acropolis, but
ﬁnally Franklin said, “Look, Pythagoras, this is nothing
against you, see, but I’m no youngster anymore and if
I keep laying around on this wet grass with you, I’m

liable to get the breakbone fever. ’ I’m going inside.”

Pythagoras, friendless now, moped around Athens for
awhile, then drifted off to Monaco where he married a
girl named Harriet Sigafoos and went into the chuck-a-
luck business. (He would certainly be forgotten today had
not Shakespeare written “You Know Me, Al.’’)

But I digress. We were beginning a discussion of chemis-
try, and thelbest way to begin is with fundamentals.
Chemicals are divided into elements. There are four: air,
earth, fire, and water. Any number of delightful combina-
tions can be made from these elements, such as ﬁrewater,
dacron, and chef ’s salad. — ’

Chemicals can be further divided into the classes of
explosive and non-explosive. A wise chemist always
touches a match to his chemicals before he begins an
experiment. ,

A variety of vessels of different sizes and shapes are .
used in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers,
- . , W,
ﬂasks, pipettes, and retorts. A retort lS also a’ snappy come-

back, such as “Oh, yeah?” and “So’s your Uncle Oscar.’~’<
I have now told you the.most.important aspects of
chemistry, but there are many more——far too many to
cover in the space remaining here. However, I am sure
there IS a ﬁne chemistry lab on your very own campus.
Why don ’t you go ‘up some afternoon and poke around?
Make a fun day out "of it. Bring ukeleles. Wear humorous
hats. Toast frankfurters on the Bunsen burners. Be. gay.

“FigI1fng" Irish Trip Panthers"

Izo, Lewis Combination

Provide Winnin Mar 'n
  g s1
’ By DAVID BREAKSTONE
Sophomore quarterback George Izo threw a 74 yard
touchdown pass on the ﬁrst play of the fourth quarter to pro-
vide a determined Notre Dame football team with a 13-7 win
over the Panthers on Saturday afternoon.
The bold play found a partially hobbled Aubrey Lewis
behind the local secondary on the Blue and Gold 40 yard line,

The fleet halback gathered theO

toss in and sped for the decisive
six.-pointer. Lewis had been
hampered since the Irish opener
against Purdue, by a sprained
ankle, but if he had any lingering
effects, his solo dash failed to re-
veal them.

The Grecn and Gold tally came
at a moment when many of the
58,775 fans might have begun to
think that the afternoons scor-
ing had come to an end. Izo evi-
dently had dilferent ideas and put
them to lightning-quick use.
Jungle Cat Coach John Michelos-
en had heard of Izo’s passing skill
for he remarked early last week,
“Notre Dame has a dangerous
passer waiting behind Bob Wil-
liams and his name is George
Izo.”

Reynolds Scores

The Irish had scored ﬁrst in
the opening stanza on a sustained
march of ﬁfty-one yards. Half-
back Frank Reynolds initiated
the drive for Notre Dame by in-
tercepting an Ivan Toncic pass on
his own 35 and returning it to
the 49 yard stripe of the home
team.

Relying on the hard running
of halfbacks Reynolds and Dick
Lynch, Ivilliams moved his
team down to the Panther one-
yard line in 13 plays. Reynolds
crashed over from there for the
touchdown. White’s attempt for
the extra point was blocked by

Rigorous Practice Drills

With Fall Sports not yet out of the way, Coach Rex
Peery has started practice for the frosh matmen who de-
termine the outcome of the future varsity teams. ,

At the present the Yearlings are practicing on the fun-
damentals. They are also viewing ﬁlms of the past N.C.A.A.

Helping the freshman for
Coach Perry is Dave Johnson,
Eastern Collegiate Champ in the
157 pound class, and Ed Perry,
son of the coach. Young Perry
won three N.C.A.A. titles and two

Coach Perry is counting heavily
on Larry Lauchle from Muncie,

last year.

Another Cub with a title is
Don Brian from Warren who
was District Champ in the

Just what do you have to do to win? This was a common question
among all the Panther rooters following the Notre Dame game. For
the ﬁrst time this season, the Panthers looked like the Blue and Gold
of old. They ran well, blocked very‘ well, and mixed up their plays
well.’ In fact, the only thing they didn’t do very well was score, but

An incident that happened the day before the game turned ou

to be a coincident the day of the game. At the press writers get—to-

- The Panthers, who have been priding themselves on their passing
up to date were a little off this game. They could only hit for ﬁve com-
pletions out of sixteen tries. Both Bill Kaliden and Ivan Toncic had
plenty of time to throw the ball. Neither one was rushed into throw-
ing but the passes were too high, too long, or too short when the in-
tended receiver was open. .

Again Coach John Michelosen found that he had a few, reserves
with some talent. Ron Kissel, who didn’t make the trip because of an
undetermined ailment, was replaced with Ken Moiitanari. Montanari,
who hasn’t been in a game since he made the varsity last season be-
cause of a plague of injuries, played an outstanding game at tackle.

The other reservewas Joe Pullekines. Pullekines replaced

Dick Scherer at end in the third quarter when Scherer and Bob

Williams were banished from the game because of unsportsman-

like conduct. His offensive blocking and defensive tackling was

lauded by backﬁeld coach Vic Fusia, who was in the press box
spotting for Notre Dame mistakes.

Michelosen, who has come out with statement after statement
that he doesn’t have any reserve strength, has found seven good
prospects since the beginning of the season.

If good fortunes may start, by the time that the Miami game
rolls around, Coach Michelosen may ﬁnally come up with a state-
.ment that he now has two complete teams to play whereas up until
now he claims to have only one. If the reserves keep improving and
the desire to winremains with the Panthers, there isn’t any reason
why they shouldn’t come up on the high end of a score against the
-:~ remaining teams on the schedule.
