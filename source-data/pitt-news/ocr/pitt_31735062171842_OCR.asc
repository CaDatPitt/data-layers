Students Coordinate Pitch To Harrisbur

STATE COLLEGE -— Dele-
gates to the Student Govern-
ment Convention at Penn
State University laid the
groundwork for better com-
munications between Pennsyl-
vania's colleges and universi-
ties this weekend.

The students decided to meet
again for a statewide convention
at Pitt late in May and slated a
steering committee session for
March 27 in Harrisburg. The com-
mittee will consist of one repre-
sentative from each interested
Pennsylvania college and univer-
sity.

During the convention, the
campus leaders spent much of
their time discussing the possibil-
ity of a student lobby in Harris-
burg. '

KLINE ENDORSES LOBBY
The lobby would seek to affect
members of the General Assem-

bly and the Governor on key
pieces of legislation.

Although the delegates did not
agree on the mechanics of the lob-
by, the steering committee will
facilitate future attempts to or-
ganize one.

Lieutenant Governor Ernest
Kline voiced his approval of a stu-
dent lobby during his~keynote ad-
dress to the convention delegates
Friday.

“I have felt for a long time,”
Kline said, “that an effective stu-
dent lobby would be beneficial to
education, students, and to mem-
bers of the General Assembly.”

During workshop sessions Sat-
urday, delegates concentrated on
various topics of concern to stu-
dents.

A group of 25-30 students met
with Dr. Helen Wise. a trustee of
Penn State University and for-
mer president of the Pennsvlvania

State Board of Higher Education,
to discuss the Master Plan for
Higher Education.

MASTER PLAN SCATHED

The Master Plan, not yet com-
pleted, recommends aid to indi-
vidual students rather than state
aid to colleges and universities
themselves.

Allen Cohen, president of the
Student Government at Temple
University, stressed the fact that
Governor Milton Shapp has “an

open mind’ about the Master Plan.

“Our aim,” he said, “should be
to fill the void in Shapp’s mind.”

D/r. Wise also disparaged the
Master Plan. “It could sound the
death knell for state colleges and
universities,” she said.

In a concensus decision, the
workshop participants took a
stand opposing the plan was de-
vised. “There was no student
input," said one member.

Voter Registration Day

One thousand two hundred and
forty-four students from Alle-
gheny County registered to vote
Friday afternoon in the Student
Union.

The registration. held from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m.. was sponsored by
the Allegheny County Chapter of
the League of Women Voters. One

istering were 18 to 20 year olds,
while 232 of the registrants were
at least 21. Also recorded were
12 changes of registration.

Mrs. Ernst Budke, vice chair-
man of the County Council of the
League of Women Voters, ex-
pressed disappointment over the
turnout. ‘‘I’m not completely sat-
isfied. We were told to expect
5,000.”

Food Service Pact Up

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

The University has opened bids
to food service firms interested in
managing its total food service
program. The current contract,
held by Saga Food Service, ex-
pires in August.

The decision to open bids is a
result of food service evaluation
being made by students and staff
members.

Specifications on food service
at Pitt have been sent to 14 food
service firms by John Vrana, di-
rector of Housing.

Vrana said these specifications

list the legal, financial and pro-

- gram requirements Pitt expects
of a food service firm.

Legal specifications include

types of insurance the firm would
be expected to carry and the vari-
ous local and state ordinances it
would have to obey.

Financial specifications explain

what the University would consi- '

der an appropriate financial ar-
rangement.

“For instance,” Vrana explain-
ed, “the firm must give money
back to the University for over-
head. Also the specifications state
that the University has the right
to approve final prices.”

Vrana says the University seeks
such programs as unlimited sec-
onds in the Towers cafeteria and
having food service management
available to meet with students to
discuss complaints. It also seeks
assurance that the food will be of
high quality. ’ ‘

The League has already regis-
tered 30.000 18 to 20 year olds in

Allegheny County high schools and '

colleges. Mrs. Budke pointed out
that the projected turnout.-was
considerably more accurate at
other schools.

Jane Thompson. executive di-
rector of the University's Citizen-
ship Information Center (CIC).
acted as a liaison between the Uni-
versity and the League of Wom-
en Voters in organizing the voter
registration drive.

In conjunction with Friday’s
voter registration, the CIC also
sponsored “Politics ’7l,” a sym-
posium on contemporary political
issues. Only 35 people attended
the symposium and Mrs. Thomp-
son termed the day’s activities
“totally unsuccessful — apathy
reigned supreme.”

Friday’s registration is the re-
sult of an extension of the voting
franchise to 18, 19 and 20 year
olds. An Act of Congress, the ex-

BETTER COMMUNICATIONS

At another workshop session,
chaired by Lynn Alstadt of Pitt,
delegates focused on possibilities
for more effective communica-
tions between schools.

The Pitt delegation, which con-
sisted of Alstadt, Program Com-
misioner Dennis Concilla’ Aca-
demic Commissioner Ted Micha-
lik and Committees Commission-
er Wade Lawson. agreed to com-
pile two books, which will be fin-
ished by May. ,

The first booklet will include
the names of Student Government
heads at Pennsylvania's colleges
and universities. The second will
list the student body sizes, bud-
gets and other statistics on the
state’s universities.

According to Alstadt, the parti-
cipants also agreed to “attempt
to get students involved in legisla-
tive and executive task forces."

Concilla, who played a major
organizational role at the confer-
ence, said he ex ects that im rov-

“Last year we only opened bids

During March representatives

an 18 year old willbe able to vote
in this state until November.”

Evaluating the extensions ov-
erall effect, she commented, “I
seriously doubt that many more
18 to 20 years olds will vote just
because they can.”

Mrs. Thompson pointed out that
voters under 36 have the worst
voting record of any age group,
applying her statement to Pitt,
she said, “I don’t see any evidence
that the people on this campus
are any more involved than the
general population.”

Mrs. Budke stressed the inno-
vative aspect and relevance of
the voting "franchise extension.
“This is your chance to voice your
opinion. It is the best way to dem-
onstrate your concern.”

American citizens, faced with
an-identity crisis or not, must
work together to ensure all peo-
ple the right of self determination.

This was the opinion of Amilie
Rorty. a professor at Rutgers,

who spoke on “Personal Identity -

and the Trials of Men and Wom-
en" at 12 noon Friday in David
Lawrence Hall.

According to Rorty, the Decl-
aration of Independence changed
society, but did not save it. Eco-
nomics and sterotyped
roles such as family structure,
hinder an individual’s right to self-
determination.

American citizens continually

I test themselves in an attempt to

present an acceptable image.
“Ours is a society in which we
put ourselves on trial,” said Ror-
ty. “Our social patterns have
placed stringent boundaries on
our self conception.” -

.“Self expression must appear
productive in our society. Self ex-
pression can only bring self re-
spect if it holds a mirror to so-
ciety for clearer vision,” said
Rorty. .

Self respect, presently only
attainable by achievement and
productivity, says Rorty, is cri-
tical to self conception. Rorty
says-she feels that a person’s fail-
ure can only produce self con-
tempt.

Most contemptuous of them-
selves are women.

“Women judge their lives with
contempt,” said Rorty. “Women’s
lives are determined by men, first
by» their fathers, then by their
husbands.” Women’s surnames
are an example. Rorty pointed out

‘ that a woman first attains her fa-

ther’s name then her husbands.

Men have been crippled by the
myths that have crippled women.

“Bot sexes must work together," ,{‘:;,,

said Rorty, “for only mutual re-
liance, not mutual dependence
will work.”

In Rorty’s opinion one of the
many menancing social norms
hindering the female today is the

family structure. The role of the

woman in the family gains the
least respect of all functions

performed by a female. Rorty-

feels that anyone is capable of
maintaining a household.

“The family may not be as so-
cially healthy as meant to be,“
said Rorty, “for the man deter-
mines the social activity of the
family. Even martial problems
are solved on the basis of affec-
tion rather than negotiation as
they should be."

Presently: the economy threat-

— ens a woman most seriously. In »

most cases. the only contact a
woman has with economics is

‘consumption. “Women are spend- - ‘

ers of what they have not earned,“
she said.

Rorty says she does not feellas
strongly toward women’s libera-
tion as a separtist movement. She
doesn’t think that women liber-
ators should form bands of sis-
terhood, for they are only creating
a new family structure.

Rorty labeled Kate Millet and
Norman Mailer (who represent
opposing views on women’s liber-
ation) asantagonists.

The solution to the existing prob-
lems is changing in society. “Our
life patterns must be changed,”
said Rorty. “Change cannot be
willed or legislated. Men and
women must struggle together,

.not work against one another.”

Chatham College, following an
intensive two-year study of the
question of admitting men, has
announced its decision to remain
a woman’s college.

In the major report, “The Al-
ternatives to Coeducation,” Pres-

ident Edward D. Eddy noted that
“the sex of the student is not ‘one-
tenth as crucial today as the com-
mitment to restructure of the
curriculum, to arrange the aca-
demic schedule, and to tighten

» total institutional effort.’.‘

Four major reasons were giv-
en for the decision to remain a

women’s college: the quality of its
academic program, the strength
of its urban location, the flexibil-
ity of its curricular approach and
the need for diversity within‘high-
er education.

The decision follows a study of

involvement in politics.

Dr. Michael Margolis, assistant professor of
Political Science, introduced the sepakers and an-
nounced that each’ had ten minutes to voice his
perspective on youth’s role in party politics.

Dr. Philip Crane of the Young Americans for
Freedom Advisory Board commented that the em-
pty ballroom was “illustrativeof the lack of will-
ingness to get involved.” Referring to commotion
in the Student Union Lobby Crane bemoaned, “It’s
obvious that they are more interested in card play-
ing than the type of discussion We’re having today."

The disenchantment of students with politics has A

been blamed for the students dropping out. But they
don’t realize that the institutions aren’t being used,”
Crane emphasized. “When only 35 per cent of the
voters in Indiana turned out to vote on the State con-
stitution, I’d call that lack of involvement.”

Ms. Jean Savage of the Socialist Workers Party
and Philadelphia mayoralty candidate began, “I can
tell you why the room’s not filled. These men are
saying put your trust in me and youth is tired of
hearing that. We’re fed up with promises.”

She criticized politicians for failing to initiate
change. “The Socialist Worker’s Party wants to
produce change that’s not based on profit or ex-_
ploitation. ” A

If elected mayor of Philadelphia Ms. Savage an-
nounced that she would levy “I00 per cent tax on all
industries producing war goods.

“It’s our country and our land. War money
should be used for free health services and to pro-
vide employment for everyone,” she attested.

When Margolis_ interrupted Ms. Savage to re-
mind her of the ten minute time limit she retorted,

“I know I’m going overtime, but I‘m the only one
here who has anything to say that is different.” a

John Scales, Democratic State chairman, asked
the audience to consider the plight of the office’
holder. “How much control does a governor really
have? What can he do to change the direction of
things if he can’t even put his finger on the prob-
lems.” Scales blamed voter apathy for the systems
faults and voiced his hope and support for the 18-
year-old voter. '

“The only way we’ll change things is through
the young. Most people between the ages of 21 and
30 don’t vote, but this is an "argument for the 18
year old voter. It‘s inconcievable that a state can
assume an 18 year old is subject to criminal law
and presume that he is not responsible enough to
vote,” Scales commented.

John Tabor of the Republican Party encouraged
youth to enter politics.

“There i“s‘”no calling that requires more of you
than in government,” Tabor opinionized. “Before
we scrounge this system let’s try to use it. And I can
tell you that Russia and it’s satellite states don’t
offer the opportunities for the young to compete
like we have here,” he concluded.

THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 1971
5th Ave. Entrance of  U.

Sponsored by Gamma Sigma Sigma

of Trustees. The group studied the
experiences of other institutions,
such as Vassar, which have be-
come coeducational. _

Discussions within the campus
community and polls of the fac-
ulty, students and staff at the col-
lege were also taken.

The results of the survey show-
ed that more than four.—fifths of
the faculty and two-thirds of the
students voted. Two-thirds of the
voting faculty" preferred to have
Chatham remain a single-sex in-
stitution. Three-quarters of the
voting students also opposed co-
education.

The committee’s recommenda-
tions were also based on its con-
tension that “a move to coeduca-
tion would not necessarily en-
hance the academic program or
the admissions and financial sit-
nations.”

President Edward D. Eddy
also noted that fmore recent
studies and widespread reports
now indicate that the applicant dip
and the economic squeeze (felt
by Chatham) are not phenomena
limited to woman’s colleges, but
affect all private colleges and
universities . . . the public insti-
tutions are now faced with a sim-
ilar tightening of fincancial re-

The committee’s study also con-
cluded that the sex composition

mining factor in a student’s choice

of institutions. It concluded that S

students tend to select a school‘
with “quality in the academic
program, flexibility in approach
and on the basis of location and
size.”

Cross registration with Pitt,
Duquesne, and C-MU was cited as
an opportunity to experience co-
educational classes and a wider
range of classes than can be of-
fered at a small college.

President Eddy offered some_
personal observations about Chat-
ham’s place in the expanding roles
of women in American society.

“One need not embrace the
Women’s Liberation Movement to
subscribe to the notion that there
is indeed a barrier against wom-
en in many channels of opportun-
ity,” he said.

“Women still have a long way
to go before we can say in all hon-
esty that they are free to com-
pete as individuals. This fact

» alone affects the continuing pos-

sibilities of single—sex colleges.”

The commitee concluded its re-
port with the hope that, “as long
as there are young women who
wish to study in the environment
of a woman’s college and who de-
velop in strength through this ex-
perience, Chatham will serve
them by making the,fullest possi-

ble use of its location, and the po- , -

tential of its program.” ~

 

A MINOR disturbance was created last Friday afternoon when the
Campus Police, believing two thieves to be holed up in the Cathe-V
dral, were forced to seal off all entrances and exits to the building.

The two men were believed to have been those who robbed the
Pittsburgh Board of Education of $250. Witnesses reported to the
Pittsburgh Police that the two men "seen fleeing the Board had en-

tered the Cathedral.

Notified of the situation by the Pittsburgh Police, the Campus
Police sealed off the building and conducted a floor by floor search

for the hold-up men.

When the search proved fruitless, the Cathedral was reopened.‘

 The two thieves are still at large.

The University’s status as a “state-related” university is in jeopardy.

Unless the current version of the Master Plan for Higher _Education is discarded,
Pitt may no longer receive direct aid from Harrisburg.

The latest draft of the Master Plan would send tuition at Pitt and other state-re-

flated universities skyrocketing. To alleviate the plight of students attending private
an-‘colleges in Pennsylvania, it would establish a broader scholarship system as a sub-

stitute for direct grants to public and semi-public institutions. ‘
If accepted by the State Board of Education, the present version of the Master

[Plan could win the support of the State Legislature and Governor Milton Shapp.

According_ to Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline, who addressed a Student Gov-

 feriiment conference at Penn State this weekend, may legislators are disturbed that

“Pitt, and Temple students are the automatic beneficiaries of a state subsidy,

 a whether they are rich or poor.” «‘

Governor Milton Shapp is reported to have an “open mind” on the subject.
~ As one student -leader put it this weekend, the aim of Pitt, Penn State, and Tem-

‘ . ple students must be to “fill the void in Shapp’s mind.”

If, in their zeal to improve conditions for private higher education in Pennsyl-

 ” vania, the state’s political leaders cut back or eliminate assistance to state-related
P . universities, all Pennsylvanians will ultimately be the losers.

s " Exorbitant tuition rates at Pennsylvania colleges and universities, even if comple-

-V ’7’me‘nted by an extensive state scholarship system, would probably drive students out
‘  C. .of the state. -

,An end to directsubsidies to institutions of higher learning could lead to a tui-

‘ tion war, with some colleges lowering tuition to attract more students and sacrific-
 liiig quality programs in the process.

".  it And- it would foster a stratified systemjof highereducation, with rich students

 

n The State Board of Higher_Education and the State Legislature must grapple
with the problems of Pennsylvania’s private colleges and universities. But the elimin-

_ation of aid to Pitt, Penn State, and Temple is not the answer.

_ Pennsylvania currently ranks 38th in per capita expenditures for higher educa-
tion. Admittedly, the state’s private colleges and universities need help. That must
not, however, be at the expense of state-related institutions.

To assist students attending private colleges and universities in Pennsylvania,
the Legislature might consider raising the P.H.E.A.A. scholarship ceiling from $800
to $1,000 or $1,200. Imaginative methods might also be found to assist private insti-
tutions themselves.

‘- Chancellor _Posvar recognizes the common ground which the state’s public and
private institutions share. He is working with other college presidents to draft an al-

ternative to the current version of the Master Plan acceptable to all spheres of high-
ereducation. ’ ‘

Program Commissioner Dennis Concilla is helping to organize a communications

netwe’il'k that may link Pennsylvania’s student leaders and make a similar cooperation
possi e. . 4 .

Their efforts are worthy of student support.-

’ The State Board of Education must be dissuaded from endorsing the current ver-
sion of the Master Plan. Pitt’s status as a state-related university is at stake.

The threat is no chimera.’ Unless the Governor knows there is a groiindswell of

iipposition to.the present version of the Master Plan, it may be incorporated into
aw. i .

_ The Pitt News urges studentx to express their views to their respective state leg-
islators and Governor Shapp. They can and must be convinced that the state’s public
and semi-public universities shouldn’t be sacrificed to save its private colleges.

Bombing, crop destruction, and

South Vietnam. Three million

people were officially register-
ed as refugees between 1965 and
1968.

An estimated 2 or 3 million
others had been displaced from
theirhomes, but had not, for one
reason or another, been regis-
tered as refugees.

The massive influx of pea-
sants into cities to escape U.S.
bomb raids has caused funda-
mental and traumatic disloca-
tions in Vietnamese life. In the
early 1960’s, 85% of the South
Vietnamese lived in the coun-
tryside. 0

By early 1969 this figure had V

dropped to 50% according to
some estimates. Saigon has quin-

cade and in 1969 had a density
of 12,740 people per square
mile, one of the highest "in the

The tripling of the population
of the cities has created huge
labor surpluses. These have
been largely absorbed by the
needs of Americans.

Young boys shine shoes, wash
cars, pickpockets, and pimp for
their sisters. Girls become bar-

Open Classroom
Creative Teachings

To the Editor, The Pitt News:

During- the Encounter in Edu-
cation sponsored by the under-
graduate cabinet of the School of
Education, Jan. 29 and 30,‘ Pitt
students discovered the Open
Classroom for the first time in a
very real way in the demonstra-
tion classroom in David Law-
rence Hall. They made pancakes,
glued a chicken skeleton togeth-
er, discovered macrame, and
tried their hand at impromtu mu-
sic making, side by side with nuns
and nine-year-olds. Time and time
again it was said, “Boy, I wish it

was this way when I went to school.

Wishing won’t help the children
who suffer today under the ty-
ranny of the tardy bell and the re-
port card. Every year tens of
thousands of bright young six-
year—olds go to school eager to
learn the joy of reading and get
instead worksheets and Dick and

’ Jane.

In a meeting during the Encoun-
ter a concerned parent spoke up:
“I’m a taxpayer and I want to

' know how many more years will

we have to wait for this (the Open
Classroom) ‘? ”

Many students here at Pitt feel
that now is the time for the Open
Classroom and feel that the uni-
versity is where it should start.
During the week a petition will be
circulated that states:

As Elementary Education majors. or fu-
ture Elementary Education majors in the
College of Arts and Sciences or the School
of General Studies. we feel that the Open
Classroom is a viable and need alternative
to the oppressive traditional classroom. We
feel that the School of Education, as an edu-
cational community, should respond to the
need of the most important members of
the community, the students. As students.

we feel the School of Education should offer
training in Open Classroom techniques and
the class on the Open Classroom being of-
fered in Supervision and Curriculum during
the Spring term. 1971. should be offered in
the Fall, 1971. in Elementary Education.
and should fulfill methods requirements.
perhaps as an alternative to Elementary
Education 150. We believe that Open
Classroom techniques should be offered in
the future as alternatives to all Elemen-
tary Education methods courses for those
students who are interested in moving in
that direction.

It may be contented that the
Open Classroom is still an experi-
mental concept, and that it would
be foolish to jump into a full scale
program. The Open Classroom
has, however, gone far beyond the
experimental stage, as can
seen in Charles Silberman’s Cris-
is in the Classroom.

The Open Classroom has been
instituted statewide in North Da-
kota and has been very successful.

The Integrated Day in many
British elementary schools has
already shown that the Open
Classroom is successful in both
middle and lower class schools.
No, the Open Classroom is no
newcomer.

Speaking of “Open Classroom
techniques” is rather mislead-
ing——“techniques” was used to
make the Open Classroom com-
prehensible to the School of Edu-
cation’s “methods” frame of
mind.

The Open Classroom is not
methods, formulas or techniques;
the Open Classroom is a philoso-
phy. In the Open Classroom all
the old traditions are gone and the
teacher has to see the child as he
or she really is: Noisy, energetic,
eager to learn and take respon-
sibility, sexual, and having self
pride that must be respected just
as an adults.

Learning is no longer competi-
tive; it becomes social, for with-

out others, who needs reading.
writing and arithmetic? Teachers
can have wholesome, human re-
lationships with their students
with the same reciprocity found
among adults, for the relation-
ship is no longer the coersive one
of report cards and detentions.

No more lesson plans, planned
curriculum, or nosey specialists;
each child learns what he finds he
needs to be a productive and crea-
tive member of society.

The greatest enemies of the
Open Classroom are the educa-

serve the needs of the educated,

by CHUCK LEVINE
Drama Staff

One of the criticims of contemporary writing and
playwriting in particular is that it is “art too aware of
itself as an art.” ‘

The implication is whatever literary worth a crea-
tion has is lost in its attempt to be an all-encompassing
medium. The current production of Redjuice by the Pitts-
burgh Contemporary Theater Laboratory seems to have
lost much of its potential effectiveness for this season.

Redjuice, the first of the two original one-act» plays
by Kenneth Regenbaum, the Playhouse student play-
wright-in-residence, is built around a debased, vulgar set
of characters.

. The opening scene is extremely effective in creating
this mood through interaction of the supposedly elderly
couple Barry (Roy Backes) and Junie (Jennifer Wells),
with their younger landlord Craig (Don Craig).

The image of obscentity is immediately drawn to its
fullest degree through dialogue, language, and body pos-
ture.

The reminiscences of Barry and Junie about their
past sexual endeavors is excellent as the sensual, stimu-

New Fiend Looms in F ilmdom

lating stories are juxtaposed with the visages and voices
of old age.)

The effect, unfortunately, is not expanded. The level
of the first scene, the tightness of the dialogue and move-
ment is lost as the play regresses into an overdependence
on the images of the audience’ who can overcome their
shock and embarrassment. Little else is left.

The overall effect is one of such a vulgar, repulsive
and repetitive atmosphere that any sense of content and
advancement disappears. That the audience becomes to-
tally lost in the sub-human sexual contortions of the actors
is apparent in the complex lack of response during the
play and at its conclusion.

Whatever merit the later scenes do have is based on
an outstanding performance by David Stuckrath (How-
ard) and the clever sound work by Lynn Schul.

The second play, Oh Boy, Its Red is a much more
conventional depiction of sexual tension. Although there
are no overt racial overtones, its style of confrontation
is much like that of LeRoi Jones’ The Dutchman.

Much of the plot is reference to action that has al-
ready taken place, had been manipulated and toyed with
by “Peter” who is actually the main center of the play,
though he never appears.

Drama Original One—ACts at Playhouse

Red now seeks revenge, through her relationship
with “Big Brother Bernard,” whose every move is dic-
tated by her will. "

The fact that the play contains only two characters
and no substantive action other than the tension of dia-
logue, places it in a position of being very dependent on
the actors and also creates a sharp contrast with the first
play. _

Deborah Kent Shore as Red and Wayne Darby Cook
as Bernie exhibit the sense of timing necessary to carry
out this type of drama. Their confrontations are emo-
tionally powerful and natural.

The set is successful in creating the claustrophobic
air of their lives and yet catching the reality suggested.

The dialogue does‘ become repetitive, however, in an
apparent attempt to create narrowly defined character

types. The images again seem overworked and over-
emphsized.

The poetic quality of the climactic scene seems out
of place, as it rises above the play’s awareness of its Own

mundane mood.

To any serious student or critic of the contemporary
theater, Redjuice would certainly be a rewarding experi-
ence. It will be at the Playhouse upstairs through March 14.

he has been Dracula, Franken-

only been in horror films for about
.14 years. After all “the King”

, fans for almost four decades.

Fans can see Lee in his latest
film, The Scars of Dracula, now
playing at the Stanley. In it he re-
creates the role of the Carpathian
Count for the fifth time since 1957,
when he started his career as a
terror monarch with Horrors of
Dracula, the closest film version
(including Lugosi’s version) to

‘ _ the original novel by Bram Stoker.

In this latest and bloodiest ver-
sion, of the classic, Dracula is
mysteriously brought to life again

ravages the village of KIeinen-
berg in revenge for the burning of
his castle, stabs a young maiden
and fatally fangs a couple of

serve commendation.

The excellent technicolor lens-
ing of M. Grant is suitably som-
bre and menacing, while the mu-
sical’ score by James Bernard
adequately underlies the action
appropriately. Also praiseworthy
are the special effects by Roger
Dicken and the art direction by
Scott McGregor. McGregor‘s
light touch in the beginning of the
film serves as a contrast to the
somebre but satisfying unfolding
of the film.

However, the best thing about
this otherwise mediocre film is
the performance of Chris Lee in
the title role. He gives depth and
meaning to the role. He himself
said in a television interview a
few years ago, “‘Depth’ is the op-
erative word. I think one is limit-
ed to a certain extent by what is
in the script. The rest is a com-
bination of one’s own imagination
and one’s thought; the way in
which one looks on a particular
character, and, of course, direc-
tion.” M

sequels have never equaled the ’57
version is because of the depart-

magazine interview: “I try to
give an impersonation which is
real and believable. I stress the
human element.”

As to his concept of Dracula,
Lee states: “I see him first and
foremost as a nobleman, a man of
dignity. A man of great power,
presence and physical impact.

“When he is action, the demon
that is within him——the undead de-
mon which is always clawing to
get to the surface—explodes into
the most tigerish ferocity and
tremendously quick speed of
movement. In this situation I see
him as an inhuman entity who is
controlled by a force that is be-
yond his own powers of control.
I try within the limitations of the
script to emphasize this power.”

In my opinion no one (including
Bela Lugosi or John Carradine)
has succeeded in being as realistic
and powerfully believable in the
role of the Transylvanian vampire
as Chris Lee.

Frank Stein, a famous horror
film expert, siad that if Boris Kar-
loff was the King of Horror then
Chris Lee should at least be con-
sidered as the “Crown Prince of
Terror.”

cial Chairman Hank Alford but
have yet to be signed.

The only thing holding up the
contract signing is a lack of addi-
tional funds which have been re-
quested from Student Govern-
ment Allocations. MDC and BAS
have approached the Allocations
Committee for the needed funds,
with the promise that the money
will be returned from the con-
cert’s ticket receipts.

The Allocations Committee has
reviewed the request for funds
and has expressed approval and a
willingness to co-operate in the
venture. Final approval is now
needed from the four student gov-
ernment commissioners and the
seven social commission mem-
bers.

If approval is granted for the
concert. it will take place on April
4 at 8 p.m. in Syria Mosque. Tick-
ets will be $3.50.

As social chairman and as a
student, Alford has examined the
past promises for concerts that
have fallen through becuase of
“political redtape.” Alford feels
that the administration, under
the four commissions and seven
committeemen, will sympathize
with Pitt students and “give them
their just due.”

“I appeal to all students who
are concerned—please urge their
student government leaders to

i. act on this issue positively.“

MR. Gimigliano of the Applied
Hypnosis Center will give a
demonstration Wednesday at
7:30 p.m. in Holland Hall's
11th floor lounge. The pro-
gram is sponsored by Wom-
en's Housing Board.

qualities that have become his
trademark. The instrumental
work is just as good or better with
the addition of a three-man back-
up band which does some good
work on keyboards, bass and
drums.

The only real difference on this
album is the addition of another
vocalist. Cass has a strong solo
voice, but she also fits into har-
monies very weel, as proved by
the Mamas and Papas. She does
the same thing here. The rotund
singer blends with Mason quite
well and is a definite help to the
music, rather than a heavy drag.
Cass, a very professional type of
singer, has good range and gives
a new dimension, a sense of full-
ness, to the songs.

Six members of the William

at the annual Pennsylvania Inter-

weekend. They returned with six
awards including a first place in
two-man debate. a third place in

first place in two-man debate.
Hilliard was rated the second
speaker in that division and Mc-
Ginnis was rated third.

In four-man debate, Jerri An-

third place. DiMuria was rated
third speaker in that division.

thing more.

Dave Mason and Cass Elliott is
a happy album. It‘s nice rock stuff
and the performance, practiced

East, is very together.

JOY OF COOKING

Joy of Cooking, a group named
after the classic cook book, has
recently released their first al-
bum, -entitled simply Joy of Cook-
ing.

The disc features a riverbank
sort of sound, similar in places
to the Band and similar in other
places to Janis Joplin. The bluesy
quality of lead singer Terry
Garthwaite (and this is a female
terry) is a strong influence on the
music.

Nixon Proposes Loan

Program Revisions

by GUS AVRAKOTOS

President Nixon recently asked
Congress to enlarge funds avail-
able for federally guaranteed
loans to college students, giving
special emphasis to students from
needy families.

An article in the Feb. 23 New
York Times said that the heart of
the President’s plan is a propos-
ed financing device aimed at in-
creasing the pool of money avail-
able for loans to students by more

‘than. $1 billion the first year.

Yearly increases are also plan-
ned.

Commenting on Nixon’s propos-
al, Charles A. Dees, Jr., Univer-
sity director of Student Aid, said
that “the general feeling in stu-
dent aid offices is that the pro-
posal isn’t better than the pre-
sent system. It increases the loan
program, and thus, in essence,
decreases the grant program.”

“Actually, what would be es-
tablished would be a national stu-
dent loan bank, patterned after
the Federal National Mortgage
Association.” The association is
essentially a private institution
that assists the housing industry
by purchasing mortgages from
banks.

The student loan association
would be financed by the sale of

‘ stock to foundations, colleges, and

financial institutions, and col-
leges. Ths would give these lead-
ers funds to restore their cash
positions and make still more
loans.

Under the present system, stu-
dents whose families have an ad-

Committee will hold an open

meeting Wednesday, March 10,

Theological Seminary on

North Highland Ave. The

meeting will focus on the de-

fense of the Harrisburg Six.

justed income (after deductions
and exemptions but before taxes)
of less than $15,000 are eligible
for federally subsidized loans of
up to $1,500.

Nixon’s proposal would, in most
cases, limit eligibility for such
loans to families with adjusted
incomes of under $10,000. Special
exemptions would be made, how-
ever, for large families with in-
comes ranging as high as $12,500.

These subsidized loans could
carry interest rates as low as
three per cent. The student would
pay no interest while in college
and would have up to 20 years af-
ter graduation to repay the note.

Dees, who sees a “. . . need for
a consistent method for financing
higher education in the country,”
says that Nixon’s plan is “not the
answer.”

“Nixon is addressing all con-
cern to the very needy and ne-
glecting the already neglected
middle class,’’ said Dees. “Sec-
ondly, he is asking the very poor
to take out a mortgage on their
entire life.”

This alleged unfairness to the
‘middle-income students is one ar-
gument voiced by Congressional
opponents of the plan. The Presi-
dent insists that if his proposal
is adopted, middle-income fami-
lies as well as the very needy will
have less difficulty borrowing for
their children’s education-

Administration officials esti-
mate that, should the proposal
become law, some 2.5 million stu-
dents would benefit, compared to
the 1.6 million presently receiving
federal aid.

Congress’ failure to act on a
similar proposal last year leads
some observers to predict rejec-
tion of the new plan.

G Unit Increases -

by ELLEN GANLEY

Two years ago one of the major issues at Pitt
was the existence of ROTC on campus. An agree-
ment finally arose with concessions made on both
sides. ROTC would no longer be a requirement for
male freshmen but would remain on campus for
those who wanted to join.

Something unexpected has happened in the Air
Force unit of ROTC at Pitt. Rather than slowly de-
creasing in size, the number of freshmen enrolling
in the program is quickly increasing.

In September of 1969, 23 freshmen joined the
program. By September of this year, the number
of those enrolling had almost tripled to 56.

Another indication of the programs success is the
number of older cadets who chose to go into the ad-
vanced stage of training that results in a commis-
sion after graduation. This year, there are 70 appli-
cants for 19 positions. All those applying are fully
qualified and more positions may be opened to ac-
commodate a larger number of men.

Col. Andy Dougherty, commander of the Air
Force ROTC at Pitt, described AFROTC as “a solid
program that cares about the student and tries to
show people what ROTC is like and let them make
their own decision on whether to enter. You can’t
brainwash students. You have to play it straight.”

The major vehicle for the transfer of ideas is
the weekly seminar. “At these sessions,” Col
Dougherty explained, “there is open discussion. We
want the guys to dissent. We want critical evalua-
tions, not yes men.” A ~

The seminars, under the leadership of Captains
Marty Anderson and George Huber, emphasize the
individual,” the Colonel continued. “We want the
guys to talk and develop their own ideas and ways
of thinking.” A

One of the first questions people ask most about

, 3

military things is “How harsh is the discipline?”
Col Dougherty described is as “not strict at all. Its
about the same as any other class in the Univer-
sity.”

Class attendance at the seminars is not insisted
upon, there is no drilling or guns, and wearing of
the uniform is required for only one hour a week.
The regulations on hair length are also lenient. All
that is required is that the hat goes on and it doesn’t
look to ridiculous.

Another interesting feature of the Air Force
ROTC is the periodic trips to Air Force bases de-
signed to give the cadets a view of military life.
Trips are taken to Cape Kennedy, Las Vegas and

Tamps. While at the base, the cadet is introduced,

to a junior officer, who is randomly selected,"
through whom the student learns both the good and
the bad points of military service.

Col. Doughty added that “some come back and
don’t want any part in the military. But even then
we’re a success. The cadet knows what he doesn’t
like and why he doesn’t like it.”

The Air Force at Pitt is also coed. At the present
time, there are three women in the corps who com-
pete along side .the men. Angel Flight, a service
organization, is the AFROTC auxiliary.

“Our overall philosophy,” Col. Dougherty stat-

' ed, “is that we are not here primarily to recruit of-

ficers. Our primary job is to create an academic
and military interface. We are trying to do the same
thing the rest of the University is doing, help the
students learn to develop their own alternatives
and options. The Air Force is shown to them in their
own environment and on their own terms.”

, Col. Dougherty stated, “We are extremely proud
of the endorsements given us anonymously in a re-
cent evaluation. They are our toughest critics. If
they say good things about us, we must be doing
something right.”

Last week white his tracksters
were preparing for the IC4A’s
coach Jim Banner expressed opti-
mism on his team’s chances in
the Eastern championships but
also said that if his team didn’t
win, they would have to accept
their performance, whatever it
was.

Banner’s athletes didn't win,
but they did finish in a tie for
second place.

Comparatively, though, the
tracksters had a very creditable
performance when it is consider-
ed that there were 66 schools
competing.

Villanova won the IC4A’s with

a 42-point team effort and was
followed by Pitt (21) and the
University of Pennsylvania (21).
The win for the Wildcats mark-
ed the fifth straight year they

have defended their Eastern
supremacy in track.
With a little bit of luck.

which has eluded the Banner-
men all season long, the story
could have been quite different
this year.

“We figured," said Pitt
assistant coach Don Mollenauer.
“that with our four main events
(and with those who had a
possibility of winning) that we
could have scored about 28
points. We did win three of
the four we counted on, but be-
cause of difficulties we missed
out on some others.”

On a brighter note, Pitt did
manage to win three events and
set three new records in the pro-
cess.

. - .  -‘V W». *-
xs ,, T‘

Jerry Richey set a new IC4A
record in the two mile run with
a time 8241.0. Richey followed
teammate Dave Szabat, who set
the pace for seven laps and over-
took him on the eighth lap of
the 16 lap race. Szabat finished
8th with a 9 203.2.

Bryant Salter, who jumped
48 feet in last week’s triple
jump at Delaware, repeated his
performance with a 50 feet IY4
inches in this jump. Salter’s
record was an initial record
since it was the first time the
triple jump had been iiicluded in
the IC4A’s . Salter is the only
athlete ever to jump 50 feet in
the East to date.

The Distance medley team
won again to complete the Pitt
scoring. Ken Silay, Dennis
Scatzman, Mike Schurko, and
Richey combined for a 9:12 in
the first IC4A Medley ever.

Smittie Brown, who had been
counted on in the 600, didn’t
fare ,.as well as he has done in
the past. He finished third with
a 1211.0. '

In that 600 race, Tom Uland
ran the third fastest 600 in the
history of the event. Only Mar-
tin McGrady and Lee Evens
have run faster. Ulands time was
a sissling 1:08.5.

On four occasions the Pitt
Tracksters barely missed out on
scoring opportunities.

In his qualifying heat (in the
440, Dorel Watley finished
third. The top two finishes in
the three heats were selected
for the finals. Though Watley’s
time of 49.3 was third in his

Tech Wrecks
Panther Finale

by MARTY HELLMAN

The Panthers found the cards stacked against them on Saturday
night at Georgia Tech and concluded the season by dropping their
third game in a row to the Yellow Jackets, 78-61.

All-American candidate Rich Yunkus lived up to his billing
as the greatest player in the school’s history by leading the South-
erners to their 20th win of the season. Along with the other seniors
on the Tech squad, Yunkus» was honored before the contest. as his

number was retired on his
‘night’ in the state of Georgia.

The Yellow Jackets had an
added incentive for victory as
they are hoping for a NIT bid
this week. The win upped their
mark to 20-8.

Only a week ago the Pan-
thers entertained a slim hope
of receiving a bid from the
New York tourney, but the Tech
loss was the third defeat on the
road for the squad, and left the
Cats with a 14-10 season record.

However, this is the best mark
for a Panther basketball squad
since the 1963-64 season and the
first winning campaign under
Coach Buzz Ridl in his three
years at Pitt.

The 17 point deficit marked
the second straight year that the
Yellow Jackets have inflicted
on the Panthers their worst de-
feat. Last year, the margin was
30 points.

The game was a lot closer than
the score indicates. For most of
the first half, the Panthers stay-
ed close to Tech and trailed 38-
30 at halftime.

In the second half, the Pan-
thers narrowed the margin to
48-46 with 11 minutes left. Yun-
kus then hit five points in a
row and from then on, the Yel-
low Jackets gradually increas-
ed their lead.

“We played in spurts," said
Ridl after the game. “Our shoot-
ing wasn’t good enough to win.
and we -missed. a lot of one-on-

 

one foul shots that could have
made a difference.”

The Panthers shot only 33
percent, from the field and
slightly better than 50 per-
cent from the foul line.

For the first time since the
Layfayette game, Mike Paul
returned to action, but hit for
only five points. Both Paul and
Buzzy Harrison played despite
ankle injuries.

“We were handicapped be-
cause both Mike and Buzzy were
not up to par," Ridl commented.

“I was surprised that we were‘

able to to use Mike and didn’t
know that he could play until
Friday."

Paul O’Gorek led the Panthers
with 17 points, while Carl Mor-
ris had 14. Yunkus, despite a
poor shooting night from the
field, tallied 25 points and cap-
tured 21 rebounds, a personal
career high.

“He made some key baskets
against us." Ridl continued.“
although he didn't shoot well
in the game."

Three technical fouls were
assessed to the Panthers, all at
critical times. In the first half.
the refs gave the Tech team
two extra free throws due to a
misunderstanding between Ridl,
Coach Fran Webster, and them.

“Coach Webster yelled some-
thing at one of our players and

heat, it was the fourth best of
the qualifying times. Still three
athletes who had slower times
that Watley were permitted to
go to the finals because Watley
was in the wrong qualifying
heat

Rick Caroselli “missed out” in

the 50-yd high hurdles as a

photo finish showed him fourth.

The top three were chosen for
the finals. And John Aiken met
the same fate in the 1,000 yd

P SU Wins Easterns,

Pitt Grapplers Ninth 3;

by MARK SIGMON

Clinching the team champion-
ship on Andy Matter’s tension-
filled victory in the 167 pound
bout, Penn Stated edged Navy,
89-85, to win the 1971 EIWA
tournament, with the Pitt mat-
men finishing .a disappointing
ninth in the team standings with
19 points. .

_ Navy, having captured the
three previous Eastern titles,
jumped off to a three point lead
over Penn State after Friday
evening’s quarter-final round.
But the Nittany Lions bounced
back in the crucial consolation
rounds and led 77-73 going into
Saturday night’s championship
finals.

Both Navy and Penn State
had four titlists apiece with
Lehigh gaining the other two
champs. Norm Pa1ovscik’s

the Middies had no consolation
finalists. Each of these two
wrestling powerhouses had two
runnersup.

Assistant Coach Dick Slutzky
had predicted that a fifth place
finish for the Panthers was a pos-
sibility. But Dave Wylie, 1970
EIWA placewinner at 134, and
126 pounder Gary McClure, both
counted on as potential pointget-
ters by Slutzky, failed to place.
Only two Pitt grapplers, Jim
Fleming (158) and Captain Bob
Kuhn (167) managed to place,
with a fourth and third, respec-
tively. I

After placing seven men into
the quarterfinals, with three (ad-
vancing on byes because Cornell
and Syracuse were snowed in up
in New York Pitt had only Flem-
ing and Kuhn, a placewinner in
both 1969 and 1970, left prior to
the semis.

Two teams, Syracuse and Cornell, were strand-
ed in New York State by snow and were forced
to forfeit their matches. Byes became necessary,
and Pitt drew three, more than any other squad.
Three Panthers were automatically in the quarter
finals.

When the action began, Adams’ first three en-
trants in the lower weights won, so Pitt opened
the tourney with six quick points before the
first man dropped out of the race for a cham-
pionship at 150. ‘

Moments before Jim Tate lost to Lehigh’s
Herb Campbell at 150, Adams was talking about
his athletes’ rather successful start. .

“I couldn’t ask for more,” he saidxenjoying
what was perhaps his best moments of the two
days. “They’re doing great-—but it’s not going
to last."

Adams knew what he was talking about.

Only "one of the remaining three Pitt grapplers
made it beyond their first opponent. And as the
competition pralonged, so did Adams’ woes.
Only Bob Kuhn at 167 and Jim Fleming at 158
could advance to the semifinals and eventually
place.

lers surviving, Adams realized where his team
would finish. He didn’t 'know"exactly_where the
Panthers were in the standings then, so he glanc-
ed at the standings which were chalked onto a
blackboard behind the tourney officials.

Adams noted~ that his wrestlers were listed
in ninth and that they couldn’t advance or drop
after tourney’s final session Saturday night.

Studying the teams scoring, which wasn’t in
any particularly helpful order, on the board,
Adams sighed, “We’re stuck in ninth.”

Placing ten wrestlers in the
semi-finals, Phi Gamma Delta
holds a 14-point edge over Delta
Tau Delta in the IFC intra-
mural mat tournament which
ends Wednesday.

The Fijis added 16 points in
Thursday’s quarter‘-finals. Six

I the Pitt rifle team lost to Clarion 1277-1255 Friday night.

The Pitt shooters have a match slated against Geneva,
who they defeated last week by 91 points, but Geneva will
probably choose not to endanger their perfect record (0-
12) and is expected to forfeit the match. Thus the Pitt team
would finish with a 5-9 record after winning ten and losing
only four last year.

Why the 180 degree turnabout?

Among the reasons cited by the shooters were (1)
the irreplacable loss of eight lettermen from last year’s
championship team; (2) complete lack of financial aid from
the school; (3) lack of a steady coach—the team has had four
coaches in four years and (4) not being allowed to use
girls on the team due to a veto by the Athletic Dept., despite
the fact that league rules permit" it and several highly quali-
fied girls came out for the team early in the season.

“I honestly expected to finish .500,” commented Junior
Bruce Barrett, “Things just didn’t work out the way I thought.
I knew the loss of the eight lettermen would hurt but I
didn’t expect that they would be missed so sorely.”

Barrett also noted the higher caliber of quality in the
league this year. “Three years ago ilndians (the league’s
undefeated 1971 champion) used to average in the high
1100’s, now they lead the league with an average well into
the 1300’s. Why,‘ Bill Crooks (the Pitt captain and high scorer)
used to average in the low 200’s (he now shoots in the 250’s),
and I was considered a big shot as a freshman because I
could hit a 230. Today, just three years later, you’re lucky if
a 240 will be good enough to get you into the top five.” ‘

Freshman Howard Ashbrook was the cutoff man for the
Pitt shooters against Clarion with a respectable 244.

Also adding to the quality of the league was newcomer
Grove City,‘ who in their first year finished right behind

- Indiana with a 10-4 record, which last year was good enough

for Pitt and Indiana to share for the top spot in the league.

The Pitt shooters, who will now prepare for the sectionals
which are to be held at Trees. Hall March 27, have reason to
be optimistic about next season, though.

1 Three of the five teams that finished with better records
(Indiana, Grove City and Duquesne) will lose most of their
lettermen; and the newcomers on the Pitt team did very
well this year after a rather slow start. The last four matches
saw three of the top five spots held down by a newcomer and
only four of the sixteen shooters on the team (Bill Crooks,
Larry LaSpada, Joe Schultheis and Sparky Yourick) will gradu-
ate.

With cautious optimism, Pitt shooters like Howard Ash-
brook, Bruce Barrett, Jim Gray, Tim Schmidt and Wade Robin-
son look toward the 1970-71 season when they no longer will
have to face the likes of Bob Doverspike (I.U.P.), Paul Whit-
worth (Grove City) and Dave Willard (Duquesne), all of
whom will graduate. '

ee=Pitt’s Rick Rowe:f%=‘=

He Swims Because
It’s “Something To Do’

by JAN FRY

Everyday on his way up to practice. Pitt‘s top freestyler, Rich
Rowe. asks himself why he's swimming. The only reason he seems to
be able to give himself is “it’s something to do."

“I hate the sport," the junior economics major remarked. “Go-
ing to meets has to be one of the most boring things in the world."

Rower furtherexplained, “Swimming is all individual, which can
make it really despressing and lonely. It gets met down. when I don't

swim I miss it. I guess lreally try
to see how far I can go."

And every since the agie of
eight when, as he put it, his par-
ents first threw him in the water,
he’s been going far. Representing
Oakmont Country Club, where he
learned to swim in the Western
Pennsylvania country club meet,
the native of New Kensington won
his first metal in ‘the backstroke
event at the.-age of 12. In tenth
grade at Burrell High School he
started swimming competively.

“I was terrible till senior year,”
Rowe stated. “It takes a while to
come on. At Burrell and Valley,
where he attended junior and sen-
ior years, we practiced on a peak
program in which we plateaued all
year and then tapered off for
WPIAL‘s.

Junior year in high school. the
freestyler placed fifth with a re-
lay team in the States and was the
alternate in the 200 freestyle. The
following year he took third in
WPIAL‘s and placed fifth in 200
and 500- freestyle in the same meet.

Why did he come to Pitt?

“I really recruited it myself,"
Rowe explained‘. "Pitt had the
best pool I‘ve ever seen and a new
athletic program. Swimming look-
ed promising here."

How4ver, he was disappointed
with the program for the last two-
and-a-half-years. so disappointed
that this season he quit because of
the coaching. (When Coach Bill
Grant resigned. he rejoined.)

“Freshman year my times were
the worst ever. It took until the
end of this season under Mr. Brad-
shaw that my times were equal
to or better than my high school
times,” remarked the recipiant
of a half-tuition swimming schol-
arhsip.

the ref thought it was directed
to him. When I tried to explain,
he gave me a technical also,”
Ridl said. '

The third technical resulted
from Mike Riggle complaining
to the refs about a lack of a
foul call. “Mike was definitely
justified in complaining and he
didn't say anything bad," Ridl
explained.

“The refs were kind of incon-
sistent on some of their calls,"
continued Ridl.

All three Panther seniors.
Riggle. Billy Downes, and Mike
Caldwell started the game.
which is the final one of their
three year career.

Ixihe three years that Rowe
has en swimming for the Pan-
thers, he’s broken the Trees pool
and Pitt record in 500 freestyle
twice with a 5:09.4 lowand the
Trees pool and Pitt record once in
the 200 free.

Last year in the Easterns he
placed 14th in 1650 freestyle. 18th
in 500 free and 20th in 200 free. In
regard to this year’s meet he
says, “I‘m really looking forward
to Easterns now that my times
are finally down.“

What does he attribute to his
success in swimming?

“You start out slow and then
you get faster and faster. All of a
sudden you drop. Coach (Dick)
Bradshaw has helped me alot,‘.'
Rowe praised. “My style has
changed since high school. I swim
a smarter race. Before I would
lay back in the beginning of a race
and try to catch my opponent in
the last 50. Now I‘ms more re-
laxed and can play with the swim-
mers. As the year goes on I be-
come more at ease in the water."

When asked why he didn‘t parti-
cipate in another sport, he ex-
plained. “It's true that there‘s
more glory in basketball or foot-
ball, but I'd rather swim on the
varsity team than be on the bench
in another sport. Besides swim-
ming requires goofy muscles and
if you run or play basketball you
get out of shape."

Rowe seldom swims during the
summer. but this summer he‘ll
be life guarding at Oakmont Coun-
try Club for the first time. How-
ever. he maintains that when he
leaves Pitt he’s finished with the
sport.

cut and clarity.

ASTROIITE

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of

their worth are:
brown'and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem’s ﬁre
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value.

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small. impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magniﬁcation by a trained eye.

CARAT: A diamond’s size is
measured in carats. As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than smaller,
perfect diamonds.
