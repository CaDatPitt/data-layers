ENNN suNvEllNE TRIP

The Senior Mining students in
charge of Professor Robert M. Black
returned on Saturday from their two
weeks’ course in undergrournd sur-
veying. The course was given this
year all a mine not previously used
by the University, the French Creek
iron mine of the E‘. & G. Brooke
Iron Co., at St. Peters, Pa.‘ forty
miles from Philadelphia. is is
believed to be the oldest mine now
open in the United States, having
vbeen started about two hundred
years ago, abandoned for a long
period and recently’ reopened. Al-
though isolated and located in the
East, the mine and surroundings are
much like those of the West. ,

The facilities available for the class
were exceptional in ‘many ways. Un-
der the present conditions it was

 

of the mine for the surveying prac-
tice, a feature of great convenience
to the students. It is also very un-
usudl that opportunity is given to
work under conditions that are al-
most those of a pioneer in explor-
ing again workings that have been
so long untouched. In addition to
the customary practice in use of in-
struments, a number of problems of
a practical nature were solved in the
mine , during the two weeks stay.
The superintendent, engineer and em-
ployee of the company gave the ful-
lest possible cooperation to the par-
ty, and this helped to make the work
simpler and more pleasant. .

The party was comfortably quar
tered in the village of St. Peters
at the French Creek Falls Hotel, on
the grounds of which are the widely-
known falls, much visited by tour-
ists. People oi the village were most
hospitable and friendly.

the University to specialize in chem-

 

istry. - During his Sophomore year,

Mr Frank was elected to Phi Lambla

This »*._.is the only"
case on record where such an honor
was conferred on a Sophomore in
the University; During his ,§enlo,,
year, he held the Phi Lambda°Upsi
Ion scholarship, which is awarded an
.nually to the student of highest rec-;.
0rd in chemistry. Mr. Frank‘ not?;
only held a remarkable record as-‘ ,3."

graduate work to enablehim to_ob-

tain the Master of Science ‘degree -at.

fessor in the Canton Christian Col-
lege in China for the next three
years. Shortly after notiﬁcation off
his appointment tothis npsosition, he
also received word that he had been

istry, andat the time of his retire-
ment in 1915, head of the Department 3.;

Doctor’s. degree from the University,
of Pennsylvania, but also studied in‘’
Wiesbaden,‘ Germany, where he waoyi
assis-taut to the“ famous Fresenius, ,
father of modern on alytical’ chemis-
try. Later he nplursued studies at Aix ’
la Chapelle under the ﬂamous Pro-f
fessor Landolt. Dr. Phillips was an
internationally recognized authority 9
on natural gas, and did much of the ,3.
pioneer work on the chemistry! of nat-__j

While the football season does not
come until the fall, many of the
alumni are inquiring already, regard-
ing the rules for ticket distribution,
etc. The Special Committee, of
which ‘Floyd Rose is chairman, is
now studying this problem and will
have a meeting tonight to decide on
deﬁnite recommendations to Athletic
Council. The same plan in effect
last yedr will likely be followed, al-
though there are a few minor

drawing -by thecormmittee on all or-
ders vwhich coﬁe in the first few
days. The rule in the past has been
that orders are ﬁled according to date
received, but so many of the alumni
are sending in the first day, In fact
‘possibly a thousand orders come in
that day, that it is felt a. drawing by
the committee will serve‘ to keep
down complaints.

Watch for the June 14, or ﬁnal is-
sue of The Weekly giving details on
this. Also watch this issue for are-
eume; by the Graduate Manager‘ of
Athletics on football prospects for
next season. This article, which is
published annually on the sporting
page of The Weekly, will give a list
of material available, plans for camp,
etc." It will give the alumni the up

them to ﬁgure out for themselves

A letter comes from W. J. (“Bili”'3
Fetter, M. 1)., '18, who has been at
the University of Edinburgh ‘doing
post graduate work in medicine dur-
ing the past year. The letter was in
reply to one from the secretary ad-
vising -that Clifford E. Barbour, ColI.,
’21, who has recently been ordained
a minister, would leave, in the near
future for the University of Edin-
burgh, where he will enter the D1-
vinity School. Dr. Fetter says:

“I am glad to know that another
Pitt man is coming to" the University
of Edinburgh. I know that he will
like it here. Howe‘-ver,. I am afraid
that when he arrives that I will ,be
over on the Continent, for I expect
to leave during the ﬁrst part of June.
I would like to have the opportunity
to introduce Barbour to some of the
people I know here, as It is pretty
lonesome for a fellow to come ‘to! a.
strange vctltyk and not know anyone.

“I have enjoyed my work here
very much. Just came back from Ox‘-
ford and Cambridge where I attend-
ed medical meetings. They are
great universities. -

“Have been getting The Weeklyn:
and thank you, very much for it.‘
Through it I am. up on all the Pitt
news. The Weekly is a blessing in
ggnany ways. .

“By the way, I visited the Amer-
ican University Union in London.
-They give an American college man
a, fine reception and make life pleas-
ant. I am glad. that Pitt is a. mem-

New‘ Student’Committee, has adopted
the Senior Counsellor ‘plan for the
guidance of the incoming freshmen.

“with marked success in many of the

largest universities in the country,
and a similar plan phas]-been in effect
-at Carnegie Tech during 1 the last
year, with good results.

"few weeks of school, the "new fresh-
man isa victim of circumstances. All
is confusion and bewilderment to
him. - In the pastvthe Y. M. C. A. has

during. registration week, its

"tion of the “Y” Handbook.-——the Fresh-

‘if. M. C. A. is, going further. Through
the Senior Counsellor plan’.  will
bring to each ﬁeshinan individually-

ance of the more ‘experienced. upper

classman. . _ .
The plan itselfis-lsimple. A‘ group.

of about 150 seniors wil be selected.

ceive the names, of about five fresh.-r

b‘er,\and whose -counsellor he. is. to

tration, if‘ possible. A banquet. will
be held some evening during the first
.week of school, where he will meet

ready. and eat with them at the same
table. ‘This will afford opportunity
for answering any Questions the new

meaning and proper observance of
the Freshman Rules; He willmeet
his group about 'once'a week for the
first fewfweeks of school, until, his
proteges will be able to take care of-

point toward University affairs and
customs, «and will have been trans-
formed into real Pitt men. with the
real Pitt Spirit. . ‘ , 5
,.Work on the various details of -the
plan was begun last Friday at »a
‘meeting at - the University cafeteria

for expression in the forum. Steps

debating in the‘ Univelisity, and to
further the interests of intercollege
iats debates. The association will en-
deavor ‘ to stage ‘in-terblass debates,
for which there has been a great de-
mand. -. Business meetings will be

I MAIIE [IN llIllVE

Complete reports of the Canton
Christian College Campaign were
turned in by treasurer L. L. Phelps
‘to the executive committee last Fri-

day and showed that a gross total
of*$1,903.00 was collected. Expenses
of $115.30 made the net total $1,787.-
70 which amount was sent to Fred-
rick Osborn, treasurer of the,Canton
Christian ‘College, in the form of a,
cashier's check. Dean A. B. Wright,
general chairman, and Leicester B.
Ferguson, student chairman, both ex-
pressed satisfaction of the results of
the campaign. Last year only $1,000
was raised; the big "amount over
last year showed that the students
are evidently more interested’ in the
success of Canton Christian College
than ever before according O to a
statement by, Dean Wright»,

A committee consisting of Leices-
ter B. Ferguson, chairman,_ M. D.
Straney, and Thrysa Amos have ap-
pointed Dean Wright as general
chairman for next year’s campaign.

The committee wishes it to be un-
derstood thaﬂ the not total of
$1,787.70 will be -used to defray the
saliiry and expenses of Henry Frank,

A Gateway
to Progress

There it stands-—
a simple forty-foot
gateway but unlike
any other in the en-
tire world. Through
it have come many
of the engineering
ideas that have made
this an electrical
America.

-.

The story of electrical development begins in the
Research Laboratories. Here the ruling spirit is oneof
knowledge--truth-—-rather than immediate practical
results. In this manner are established new theories-
bools for future use—-which sooner or later ﬁnd ready
application. ‘

The great industries that cluster around Niagara
Falls, the electrically driven battlesliips, ‘_the trolley
cars and electriﬁed railways that carry millions, the
household conveniences‘ that have _reliev_ed_ women of
drudgery, the labor-saving electrical tools of factories
all owe their existence, partly at least, to the c'o-ordi-
nated efforts of the thousandswho daily stream through

this gateway.

, Virginia’s captain,

o

-elll WEST VllllilNlA

Although our baseball team outhit
West Virginia they were forced to
accept the worse end of a 5-4 score
last Monday when they played the
Mountaineer baseballers at Morgan-
town in the first of a two-game series.
The second game, which was played
the following day also at Morgan-
town, was also lost, this time our
representabives losing 9-6.

It was a crime to lose the first
game. We had many opportunities
to win, but on each occasion West
Virginia's pitcher, Woods, applied the
brakes and averted damage. West
Virginia succeeded by talking advan-
tage of openings.

Pitt was first to score in the
fourth. Gables, who had reached
first through a ﬁelder’s choice, was
sent home by pitcher Noble’s triple.
West,Virgin=ia came back in her half
of the inning -and scored four runs.
With one down, W'eik d-oubled to
right, and Martin walked. Both men
advanced on 3. passed ball and scored
on,,Mayﬁeld’s two ibase hit to center.

l

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

.Mayﬁeld also scored on Mowrey’s

double to right. Mowrey scored with
the fourth run of the inning when
Davies threw wild to first in an at-
tempt to catch Wright. Two singles,
a pair of errors, and a base on -balls
allowed the Panthers to tie the score
at four in the ﬁfth inning. West
Homer Martin,
won the game for his team in the
sixth inning by tripling and scoring
on Lytle’s single. ,

The second game of the West Vir-
ginia series was lost on Decoration
Day in the first four innings when
the Mountaineers scored eight runs.
But in spite of the eight run lead
against us, our baseballers continued
to fight. In the ﬁfth inning they ral-
lied strongly enough to register six
runs. Evans, however, who, up to
the ﬁfth inning had been invincible
became invincible again, with the re-
sult that we did no further scoring
after he ﬁfth.

The ‘batting star of Pitt was Cap-
tain Cook, who batted safely four
times. Gahles for the second consecu-
tive day, made two -hits. Holleran,
Davies, Hill, Barber and Cooper each
made one hit. The score:
