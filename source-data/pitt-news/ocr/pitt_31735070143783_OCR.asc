son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,
took the stage

At the event hosted by Rockthe
Vote, a national organization dedicamd
to  young adults to vote and
encouraging them to turn out on Elec-

change. A
After the speech, Kermedy told The

When it comes to supporting
V a political candidate, few things
A seem more innocuous than wear-
” ing "a badge, button or shirt with
the candidate’s name on it. But
 at least two poll workers in Al-
 legheny County think that wear-
‘ ing campaign merchandise also
3 constitutes a solicitation of votes
 and want such items banned in
3 polling places. In fact, they dis-
’ agree so strongly that they’re su-
 ing the Pennsylvania Department
 of State because of it.
i The lawsuit is a reaction to
I a letter that the Department
of State sent out to the county
boards of all 67 Pennsylvania

Truth not an asset in campaigning

 
    

by Brandon Pfeffer
Colwnnidt

Among all the sugary cam-
paign promises we’ve been digest-
ing lately, both presidential candi-
dates have vowed to counter the
6.1 percent unemployment rate in
the U.S. by creating new jobs. Nei-
ther candidate will have any prob-
lem accomplishing that goal if he
continues to keep the media fact-

as they have been in recent weeks.

of government to bail out and
reward those who act irrespon-
sibly, whether they are big banks
or small borrowers.” Since that
statement in March, McCain has
leaned further toward helping out
individuals and families who were
targeted for risky loans — not big
institutions. '

McCain actually said in Sep-
tember, “I will fight for those that
lost their jobs, savings and real
estate investments. Some Ameri-
cans have been left behind in the
changing economy, and it often

responded, “I’ve been working 
as the governor of this state that
produces nearly 20 percent of the
U.S. domestic supply of energy.”
Let’s ignore Palin’s attempt to
steer the question to friendlier
territory. What she said — that
Alaska produces one-fifth of the
nation’s domestic energy supplies
-— is straight-up wrong. If you
direct your attention to the most
recent numbers available from
the federal Energy Information
Administration, you’ll notice that
Alaska produced 2,417 trillion
BTU’s of total energy in

 polling reﬂecting the tight

person’s political T-shirt would i

do almost nothing to change his j

mind about whom to vote for.

All it’s really doing is asking
people to be unbiased and non-
partisan about a process that has
bias and partisanship written into
it at its core.

There are deﬁnite problems
with allowing people to wear po-
litical items into a polling place,

as it then falls to poll workers and ;
other officials to decide where to 
draw the line between “passive” 
3 Obama and McCain. The vice-

and “active” electioneering.

For instance, wearing a T-shirt 
saying “McCain/Palin ’O8” could 

be very different from handing

out pamphlets saying, “Vote for 
john McCain!” Leaving it up to 

poll workers, many of whom
have political beliefs of their
own, to make the distinction be-
tween whom to allow and whom
to throw out could be problem-
atic.

It’s difﬁcult to disagree with
the fundamental position of the
ACLU, but it is easy to ﬁnd ex-
amples in which their reasoning
could lead to problems Nov. 4.

the 69,381 trillion BTU’s of
energy the whole country
produced that same year,
andthe portion of national
energy production that Alas-
ka supplies is closer to 3.5
percent. Ouch.

That hasn’t stopped
both her and McCain from
using that inﬂated statistic
over and over again, coming
back to it with various TV

R


anxious seniors in Florida.
But if you’re looking for
the real meat here, forget about

presidential candidates must think
no one is paying attention to them,
judging by the fanciful quotes and
statistics they’ve been throwing
around.

On Sept; 15, while rallying
in Michigan, Biden made use of
some creative editing to explain
McCain’s take on the mortgage
mess. He said, “In the midst of
the housing crisis, John McCain
said, ‘I will ﬁght for those that lost
their  real estate investments 
It’s not the role of government
to bail out big banks or small bor-
rowers.’ What about the people
who don’t invest in homes, but live
in them?”

. Glad you asked, Sen. Biden. If
you would have included McCain’s
whole quote, it would go some-
thing like this: “It is not the duty

seems the government hasn’t even
noticed.”

McCain’s Web site elaborates,
“No taxpayer money should .bail
out real estate speculators or ﬁ-
nancial market participants who
failed to perform due diligence
in assessing credit risks. Any as-
sistance for borrowers should be
focused solely on homeowners.”
Does that answer your question,
Sen. Biden?

Not to be outmatched, how-
ever, Gov. Palin has been cranking
out one gem after another, despite
the fact that the GOP recently
muzzled her to prevent her from
conducting any unscripted media
exchanges. In her ABC News in-
terview with Charles Gibson, she
delivered one whopper after an-
other. In response to a question

interviewers.
It would be entirely un-

fair to expect all the players in ~

this race to produce valid and ac-
curate facts for every argument
they make; mistakes are bound
to pop up along the way in such a
long contest So it might not seem
worthwhile to act like the witling
in the back of the classroom who
calls attention to the speaker’s ev-
ery tiny misstep, but there is a big
difference between an innocent
gaffe‘ that appears once or twice,
and integrating that misinforma-
tion into a recurring argument of
your campaign.

In the words of one man who i

might soon be commander in

The scienc

by Colleen Seidel
Staﬁ’ Wrder

 

I’ve always been more com-
fortable typing away in front of a
computer screen than sitting be-
hind a lab bench mixing chemicals
and staining cultures. I’ll be hon-
est: As a college student, my body
of scientiﬁc knowledge doesn’t
extend far beyond that which I
learned from Bill Nye — in the
fourth grade.

But, little did I know, there’s a
veritable science lesson in every
glass of Yuengling or Sam Adams
or Dogﬁsh Head that I happily
consume every weekend.

I stumbled upon last week’s
edition of NPR’s “Talk of the
Nation: Science Fridays,” in
which Gavin Sherlock, a genetics
scientist at Stanford University’s
School of Medicine, explained his
research in genetically coding dif-
ferent strands of lager yeast, and
it piqued my curiosity. just what
is so scientiﬁc about beer? And
why were we never taught this in
freshmen biology?

 

After perusing the Internet on
sites like howstuffworks.com and
a rather informative student page
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti-
tute (Google something like “sci-
ence of beer” and you’ll ﬁnd both
pages and tons more), it turns out
that the process of brewing a pint
or two is actually quite scientiﬁc.

It all starts with the four basic

ingredients of beer: barley, hops,

yeast and water.

The brewing process employs
the seeds of the barley plant, but
unlike the beef barley soup my
mom used to make, you can’t just
throw the seeds into a pot and
start to brew.

Instead, the seeds have to ger-
minate ﬁrst — that is, they have
to start sprouting. This sprouting
occurs by ﬂushing the seeds with
water, then draining them and
holding them at a constant tem-
perature of 60°F for ﬁve days un-
til sprouts show. These germinat-
ed barley seeds are then dried in
kilns at temperatures up to either
l22°F for lighter malts or 220°F
for darker ones.

The germination process of

e of beer,

the barley seeds is crucial to beer
brewing. By germinating, the seeds

produce the enzymes necessary to _

break down starch (long chains of
sugars) into simple sugars (short
chains) in a process that produces
a sweet, sticky liquid called ‘mash.’
These short chains of sugars can
then be fermented by yeast later
in the brewing process.

Hops are those things in beer
commercials that the burly-look-
ing brewers are always running
their hands through, holding up
to their faces and smelling. That
explains almost nothing about
what hops actually are and their
role in the process of brewing
beer, though.

Hops are actually the ﬂower
of the hop vine — interestingly
enough a member of the hemp
family —— and their role in beer is
to provide ﬂavor and aroma from
their highly water—soluble oils and
bitterness through their resins,
named Alpha and Beta acids.

It is in the boiling step of the
brewing process, the step that
comes after the mash, that hops
are added at different intervals

depending on their purpose. The
ﬁrst hops added to the boil con-
tribute the bitterness tothe beer.
Because these bitter acids of the
hops are not easy to extract, the
hops have to be boiled for 90
minutes. ,

Near the end of the boiling
stage, the ‘finishing hops’ are
added, which contribute the ﬂa-
vor and aroma of the beer. Since
these ﬂavoring oils are relatively
easy to extract and can evaporate
quickly, the ﬁnishing hops only
have to be in the boil for a few
minutes.

Next 0 comes yeast, which
makes all the magic happen. In
fermentation, this tiny single-
celled organism is responsible for
converting those simple sugars
into the alcohol and carbon diox-
ide (i.e. gas) we all know and love
in our beer. It does this by a pro-
cess called glycolysis that breaks
glucose molecules down into car-
bon dioxide and ethanol (alcohol)
molecules through chemical reac-
dons

terrnine the type of beer that is
brewed.

In this sense, there are two
main types of yeast. ‘Ale yeast,’
or ‘top-fermenting yeast,’ named
such because it initially collects at
the surface of the beer, is used to

_ make ales and stouts in a temper-

ature range of 55—75°F. ‘Bottom-
fermenting yeast,’ better known
as ‘lager yeast,’ is used to make
lagers. Lager yeast takes substan-
tially longer to ferment sugars,
and it works best at a much cooler
temperature range of 32-55°F.

Having satisﬁed my intellec-
tual query into the science be-
hind beer, of which there is far
more technical and explanatory
information out there than what
I described here, I decided it was
still best to leave the science stuff
to the experts and just stick with
what I know—- that is, consuming
it, which, I think we can all agree,
involves a lot less thinking and a
lot more fun.

I would like to advocate the
idea that we bring Bill Nye back to
television with a show geared to-
wards college kids. Just a thought.

MR: I often pushed it to -the point of al-
most getting in trouble. The most creative I
got was when my best friend and I created
a gossip tabloid about other kids at Pyle ]u'—
nior High’ School. It was highly evolved class
clowning. I was so proud of it because it was
good enough that teachers actually bought
copies of it. Even the Vice principal bought
a copy. 1

TPN: You graduated from Harvard. How
close is that school to its stuffy, Ivy League
stereotype?

MR: The reputationof Harvard manifests _

itself in student behavior in two ways. It can
be very obnoxious with students “who think
they are the chosen ones, out to run the
world. That’s obviously not very appealing
e— not even to insiders. At the same time,
there’s a kind of relaxed way that people
think, well, I’m here.

I think some graduates of Harvard get hung
up on what they thinklpeople expect from
them, that they’re supposed to take over the

‘ world. And when they don’t three years out

of college, they get really neurotic. But my
first job out of Harvard was a roller skating

waiter outside of D.C. Thankfully, I didn’t '

think of myself as the next world leader.

TPN: What were you involved in at
school?

MR: I did a ton of theater.‘I did some

AG.E.D. instruction at a prison —— otherwise -
‘ I would’ve had no dating life. I was a mem-

ber and the president of the Hasty Pudding
show — it was an originally written musical,

but all the actors are men, though half the I

characters are women. It was probably much
more fun to be in then watch.

TPN: .You’ve had some really interesting, ‘I

zine consultant, you wrote for (children’s
television series) “Wishbone,” and you

A were a Larry King correspondent. Is there a

method to your choices?

. MR: Hopefully there’s more rhyme or rea-

son than not. I’ve gotten to the point in" my
career that I onlydo stuff I’m interested in.
Remember the little variety packs of cereal?
I love those — that’s reﬂected in my career.
I mean, if I could do college over I’d only

do electives, no concentration. I do want my

own show. I love being out in the ﬁeldand
doing interviews where the comedy comes

from real moments, not scripted jokes.
That’s really hard to do, but I love mining
laughs from the real exploration of some-
thing ridiculous.

TPN: What was your first role in the me-
dia? '

MR: I did theater for a while. I was in the
Southeast Asian touring crew of “Grease,”

which was really  —— standing room only ‘

in Jakarta. Then I started  for [’90s

Pitt opens things up, slips past Iowa

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

The Iowa defense gave I.eSean
McCoy a headache through three
quarters on Saturday.

As it turned out, a 27-yard
touchdown run was all he needed
to cure it.

McCoy gave Pitt the lead with
his run early in the fourth quarter,
and the defense held on the rest
of the way to help Pitt (2-1) take
down Iowa, 21-20, despite being

 

Ben Filio I Assistant Photo Editor

outgained in nearly every statistical
category.

But according Pitt linebacker
Scott McKillop, there’s only one
statistic that matters: who wins.

j Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt,
who entered Saturdays game 0-5 in
contests following bye weeks, said
that the most encouraging part of
the game came when the team had
the most pressure on it.

He also mentioned the run by
McCoy, which put Pitt in the lead.

Commentary

“It was a slow start for him,”
said Warmstedt of McCoy. “But I
thought he ﬁnished strong.”

McCoy fumbled on Pitt’s ﬁrst
offensive play. But on its next pos-
session, the Panthers avoided a let-
down. .

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull start-
ed the series with two consecutive
complete passes, the second be-
ing a 20-yard toss to senior Derek
Kinder across the middle, 
Pitt into Iowa territory.

The Panthers then pushed to
the Iowa 17-yard line before trans-
fer quarterback Greg Cross jogged
onto the ﬁeld for his ﬁrst play in a
Pitt jersey.

With Stull still in the game,
Cross stood in the shotgun forma-
tion behind center. Stull stood to
his right, then moved in motion to-

wards the sideline. Cross dropped _

back, looked around momentarily
and then shot up the middle, weav-
ing through the left side of the ﬁeld

run.
“They both had options de-
pending on the defense,” said
Wannstedt of the two quarterbacks
being in at once. “Our offensive
line did a nice job blocking, so it
worked.”

After Andrew Taglianetti par-
tially blocked an Iowa punt on its
next possession, Pitt once 

marched down the ﬁeld. Bill Stull _

ran for six yards on third-and-goal

As the crowd roared in the ﬁnal
minute of Pitt’s win over Iowa on Sat-
urday, one  was certain: Defense
does win games

It might have taken two games,
but the defense ﬁnally made that all-
important game-changing play.

And it came from an unlikely
source.

Tony Tuckefs forced fumble with
50 seconds left in the game is just what
the Panthers were looking for

“That’s a big play,” said Pitt line-
backer Scott McKillop of the fumble.
“[Tucker’s] young. He’s our third de-
fensive end And just seeing him there,
making that big play, I was happy.”

And he should be happy.

The Panthers, who struggled the
ﬁrst two games to make 
happen defensively, dominated the
I-Iawkeyes’ offense on Saturday, es-

peciallytowardstheendof thegamei

Along with Tuckefs forced tumble,
the defense recorded six sacks and had
Iowa quarterbacks Jake Christensen
and  Stanzi hurried consistently.

Throughout the game Pitt explod-
ed with big plays from players all the
way down the depth chart It was the
perfect blend between youthful speed
and veteran leadership.

Younger players like linebacker
Greg Williams, whose two sacks led
the team, and defensive end Jabaal
Sheard, who batted two passes down
at the line of scrimmage, mixed well
with veterans like McKillop, who an-

chored the Panthers’ defense by once
again leading the team in tackles

For the younger players, growing
up is good But learning from McKil-
lop might be better.

“Greg [Williams] did [have] a
great game,” said McKillop “He’s still
young Each game he’s  to ma-
ture more and get more experience.
Him and Austin [Ransom] grew up a
good bit today.”

There is no doubt that the positive
stndes the defense took  Iowa
caught the eye of Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt. ‘

“I was really pleased with how
our defense rose up,” said Wannstedt
“\We’re still  on defense. \V1th
the new coaches we have and the play-
ers, we’re still working through some
things I thought it was a great job by

our coaches and players of executing
the p ”

The momentum created by the
defense came ‘back full  to quar-
terback Bill Stull and the rest of the
Panthers’ offense, who fed off of the
energy that the defense brought to the
atmosphere.

Down 17-14 late in the third quar-
ter, Iowa started a drive that looked to
put the backs of the Panthers against
the wall On the ﬁrst play, McKillop
sacked Christensen for a loss of seven
yards On the  play, Mick W11-
liams hurried Christensen out of die
pocket and forced an incomplete pass
Third down would fare no better for
the Hawkeyes, and they were forced
to punt.

A great three-and—out series by the
Panther defense ﬁred up the crowd in

a way that only Neil Diamond could
have hoped for.

The result? A nine—p1ay, 80-yard

improved to 2-1 and gave their fans 1

some hope. But more importantly, the
defense began to mature, which is
what this team needs as they prepare
for the rest of season

“We’re  to go out there and
take care of business,” said McKillop
of next week’s game against Syracuse.
“We’re on a two-game win streak, and

Pitt volleyball smashes Way to tourney 

by Randy Lieberman
Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team is
starting to show clear signs of
life.

Pitt dominated last weekend’s
22nd annual, two-day Pitt Invi-
tational at the Fitzgerald Field
House, taking home the champi-
on_ship by knocking off Gonza-
ga (3-2), Eastern Michigan (3-2)
and VCU (3-1).

The Panthers (7-7) now ride
a four—game winning streak into
their Big East schedule.

“We set a goal going into
this past week of ﬁnishing .500
before Big East play,” said Pitt
coach Toby Rens.

“Considering how difﬁcult
our preseason schedule was,
along with the coaching change
and everything, I feel we’re start-
ing to play our best right now.”

The three wins extended Pitt’s
winning streak to four games af-
ter a 3-0 win against Robert Mor-

 

ris last Tuesday.

Just last week, the Panthers
were in the midst of a ﬁve—game
losing streak in which the Pan-
thers won only two sets in ﬁve
matches.

nitely came away from the
T weekend feeling like we

turned the corner.

Rens

Rens said the pressure of
playing tougher competition dur-
ing the Loyola Marymount game
in the Los Angeles tournament
last weekend, coupled with the
last four wins, helped him gauge
where the Panthers were as far as
adjusting to his new, faster sys-
tCII'1.

“Being in those pressure situ-
ations really helped us learn a lot
about our team,” said Rens.

“All along the emphasis has
been to put the roadmap out there
in terms of our system while try-
ing to understand it, learn it and
then apply it. When we ﬁnally
clicked, we deﬁnitely came away
from the weekend feeling like we
turned-the corner.”

Pitt opens its conference slate
with matches at Villanova (Sept.

- 27) and Seton Hall (Sept. 28)

next weekend.

Pacing the Panthers in their
Pitt Invitational sweep was in-
vitational MVP Kelly Campbell,
who posted a season—high 20
kills in the championship match
and notched 56 kills, 35 digs and
ﬁve aces throughout the tourna-
ment.

joining Campbell on the all-
invitational team were senior Jes-
sica Moses and junior Michelle

Rossi.

Moses recorded nine kills and ﬁve
blocks in the championship match, while
Rossi added 12 digs.

Campbell paced the Panthers in their
ﬁrst match of the invitational —_ a come-
back win against Gonzaga last Friday. She
notched her third double-double of the
season with 19 kills and 11 digs.

Senior Nicole Taurence added 47 as-
sists, and freshman Hannah Swysgood,
in her newly anointed starting role, had a
career—high six blocks.

Down two games to one, the Panthers
sprinted out to a 9-5 lead in the fourth set
thanks to a block from Taurence and Mo-
ses to force a Gonzaga timeout.

Senior Stephanie Ross notched two
aces to extend the Panthers’ lead out of
the timeout. Eventually, a block from Tau-
rence and Swysgood gave the Panthers set
point at 24-17.

After Gonzaga held a pair of balls,
sophomore Amy Town sealed the set with
a kill from the outside.

In the deciding set, the Panthers

. stormed to an early 6-2 lead riding two

Campbell kills.

Later, a Town kill set up match point at
14-7. Taurence set Campbell on the out-
side for the match—winning kill.

“We showed a lot of good poise against
Gonzaga. We never felt a sense of panic,”
said Rens.

“The two games we dropped, we
weren’t passing very well. Really, the
fourth and ﬁfth game we really improved
a lot to the point where we had three or
four options.”

In its second game, Pitt faced an East-
ern Michigan squad that Rens described as

“probably the best defensive team we have

September 22, 2008

played.”

Campbell and junior Meagan Dooley
each recorded double-doubles, while Tau-
rence added 46 assists and 15 digs.

The match came down to the wire as
both teams played to the ﬁfth set.

In the ﬁfth set, the Panthers held an
8-5 advantage thanks to one of the 17 kills
Campbell recorded in the match.

A few plays later, Town stuffed an
EMU attack to give Pitt 21 12-7 lead and
force an EMU timeout.

Dooley then spiked the Panthers into
the championship match with a kill on a
set from Taurence.

The third game brought a talented
VCU squad, which Rens thought was
the tournament favorite heading into last
weekend.

“They just have so many athletes that
can jump up and get the ball,” said Rens.

But the Panthers were feeling it against
VCU and pounded them with a convinc-
ing 3-1 victory.

Campbell led the way with 20 kills,
while Town tallied 11 kills.

“We strategically went after a couple
of their players who struggled at times to
pass the ball,” said Rens.

“That helped put us in a better posi-
tion defensively. On our side we passed
really well and we had very few reception
errors.”

Rens said the Panthers needed some-
thing positive to take with them into Big
East play.

“It’s excellent because now we have the
feeling of success after several weeks of
working on what we wanted,” said Rens.

“It was good to see some smiles on the
faces of the players.”

Tucker, Romeus help
Panthers seal victory

Football, page 15

for the score. The extra point gave
Pitt a 14-3 lead.

i But it wasn’t even close to over.

Iowa used a rushing touchdown
from tailback Shonn Greene to cut
Pitt’s lead to four, which is how it
stayed headingto halftime.

' ' Greene ﬁnished the game with
147 yards on 23' carries. It was
the fourth straight game in which
Greene has compiled more than
100 yards on the ground. ~

Iowa then took the lead on its
second drive after halftime on a
two—yard run by quarterback Jake
Christensen. ,

The lead didn’t last long.

Two possessions later, Pitt took
the ball on its own 20-yard line with
2:44 left in the third quarter. _

Four minutes later, McCoy
broke through the left side of the
line and into the end zone for what
went on to be the game-winning

SCOIC.

The defense did the rest.
With 2:19 remaining in the

game, Pitt punter Dave Brytus 2 if

pinned Iowa back to its own one-
yard line. V

A few plays later, Pitt defensive
end Greg Romeus sacked Chris-
tensen for a loss of two yards.

The next play, Romeus recov-
ered a Christensen fumble forced
by Tony Tucker to ﬁnish the game
off.

Iowa‘ (3—l), which hadn’t al-
lowed a touchdown in all three of
its games leading up to Saturday,
had more rushing yards, passing
yards, first downs and time of pos-
session than Pitt.

Still, Pitt came through with the
victory. « , - ‘

‘‘It’s good to get the win,” said
Wmmstedt. -

Pitt hits the road to face Syr -
cuse on Saturday.

Wannstedt looks

to get Cross more involved

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor "

Crossing quarterbacks
Greg Cross’ first play for the Pitt
football team couldn’t have turned
out any better: a 17-yard touch-
down run to give Pitt the lead.

His second play, which didn’t
come until the fourth quarter,

‘couldn’t have been much worse:

a 10-yard loss on a rollout to the
right side.

Cross, who transferred to Pitt
in the spring, brings speed to the
quarterback position. But because
Saturday was his first action behind
center, Dave W/annstedt and the

I rest of the Pitt coaching staff are

still  to figure out when they
should and shouldnft use him.

Still, W/annstedt said that Pitt
needs to use Cross more.

“We’ve got to do a better job
getting him some more looks,
handing the ball off and 
some regular plays,” said Warmst-

edt after “Pitts win over Iowa on

Saturday.
. Warmstedt added that Pitt had -

multiple sets to use Cross in but
just couldn’t come up with the right
time to get him in. '

In no rush

Through three gaines, LeSean
McCoy is stillwithout a 100-yard
game.- He had 18 _carn'es for 78

-yards and a touchdown on Satur-

day, and’ he is averaging 3.8 yards
per carry. That’s one less yard per
touch than he averaged last year,
when he was the Big East confer-
ence’s' rookie of the year and ran
for more than 1,300 yards.

Pitt fullback Conredge Collins,
who’s ranked as the top senior full-
backiin the nation by ESPN.com’s
Mel Kiper _]r., had only two rushes
for four net yards Saturday.

Through three games, Collins’.
touches are down from the past.
He’s carried the ball three times for

11 total yards. I

Last season, Collins carried the A

ball 33 times for 110 yards and a

touchdown.,He also caught seven 3 '
balls for 60 yards.'In 2006, he car-

riedithe ball 29 times for 115 yards

and had 20 receptions for 198

yards.
Saturday marked his first recep-
tion of this season: a six-yard gain.

Stullin' out
Quarterback Bill Stull’s attempts

and completions have dropped in ,

each of Pitt’_s three games so far
this season. M g

In Pit_t’s opener against Bowling
Green, Stull attempted 51 passes.

. The next week against Buffalo,

he let it go 33 times. On Saturday
against Iowa, he attempted just 25
passes. .

Through three games, he has
one passing touchdown, one rush-
ing touchdown and three intercep-
lions.
