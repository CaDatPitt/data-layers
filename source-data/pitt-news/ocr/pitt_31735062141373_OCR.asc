Fraternity Men

Sigma Pi Drops Out

   

Of the fraternities stlll active on
campus Phi Epsilom Pi took first place
for the year 1931-1932 in the fraternity
scholastic standings prepared by the
office of the registrar and released
through the Dean of Men’s ofﬁce last
week. The Phi Epsilon average for
the year was 1.66. -Sigma Pi, no longer
afﬁliated with the lnterfraternity coun-
cil, ﬁnished ahead of Phi Epsilom Pi
with a quality point average of 1.73,
but will not receive the interfraternity
trophy. .

The leading fraternity for the sec-
ond semester of .school last year was
Omega Delta with a 1.70 average.
Omega Delta, has led all other fratern-
ities ﬁve times since 1925 and has ﬁn-
ished below second -only once since
that. time.

. Fraternity Average High

The quality point average of all
fraternity men for the past year was
1.275, which statistics compiled by the
registrar indicate that the all-men’s
average is approximately 1.247, show-
ing a slight advantage for the frater-
nity men. '

The biggest jump taken by any
fraternity was a, move from twenty-
ﬁrst to thirteenth position by Alpha
Phi Delta. Theta; Chi, ﬁrst last year,
dropped to last in this year’s stand-
ings.

A signiﬁcant fact of this year’s
statistics is that the all-fraternity
scholastic average is higher than in
any year since the average has been
taken. Correspondingly the all-men’s
average is lower than in any previous
year in which the averages were taken.

committees. Every woman on the
campus interested in committee work
will be placed.

At the ﬁrst meeting of each com-
mittee, members will sign blanks ac-
cepting their positions for the year
and pledging their ‘cooperation.

New Three - year Program
Is Approved} By Army
Department For Pitt

 

To Affect  Classes

A new program ofsinstruction which
differs materially from the heretofore
prescribed R. O. T. C. program is be-
ing instituted in the military depart-
ment this year. The new program
has been prepared by the officers on
duty and has beengapproved by the
War Department foifia three-year trial
at the University, beginning this year.

The most noted ._;S:change is in the
basic course, whereﬁall technical sub-
jects’ pertaining "to Coast Artillery
have been eliminated and subjects of
a general naturehave been added‘ in
order to train the student primarily
as a prospective officer candidate.

Eliminate Techpical Subjects

On the average -only one student in
ﬁve who completes the basic course
is selected for the advanced course.
freshman‘-sophomore program,
while developing good officer material
to go on with the advanced course, is
intended to give students -subjects
which will be of great value to them
in a civil career rather than technical
subjects which will be -of value only if
they follow their military work.

The changes in the advanced course
have been to eliminate, to rearrange
certainsubjects, and to add others of
a technical nature which will be appli-
cable‘ to Coast Artillery work. The ob-

lect o.f the advanced course is to qua1i- '

fy students for commission in the low-
est grade of the artillery section in
the Officers’ Reserve Corps.

The subject matter -of the junior
course has been so arranged. that the
students will be thoroughly prepared
and will receive a. maximum beneﬁt
from attendance at the R. O. T. C.
camp, where purely practicaly train-
ing in military subjects is given.

All students of‘ the advanced course
will be required r_to attend a six weeks
camp at the end of their junior year.

The subject matter of the basic and
advanced course has been outlined by
the military department in the follow-
ing manner:

. V Outline Course .

First year basic-—-The R. 0.. T. C.,
man of arms, map. reading, .. military

You may call at myt-office for

regéistnation procedure. ,
John -Weber, University business
manager, interviewed yesterday, said
that the admittance -of the single pro- 
testant became effective with the re.-
ceipt of the 1-atter’s written statement
of why he declined to sign the pledge.
Contents of the voluminous statement
of reasons submitted to Dean ‘Sieg
were not available for publication. »
The letter admitting the student _,to.-,
registration was written in ianticipa- '
tion of his statement of reasons, Weber: .. .
explained, and not as a result of ‘it. — 2 
Asked what action would be taken 
in the event of "retraction of pledges I
by other students who signed at regis-Q.-.
tration, Weber replied: ‘  " V ‘ i=-""'.-"
“We assume that none of our" Stu? ’
dents V who voluntarily signed‘ the A
pledge would be so lacking in the, _,
courage of his convictions as to re-
tract his pledge of allegian=ce.’’, . 
Fourapplicants for admission to the 
University questioned the meaning._of._'
the requested pledge at registration
last week, one of them a graduate stu-1'
dent who, because of his religious be
liefs, was not expected to comply, of -._
the other three, two signed after the §
nature of the pledge was explained
Weber said, and the third asked=rleavje
to present in writing his reasons for
not signing. The latter was the stu
dent who is being admitted today.
Inclusion of the pledge in the regis-_..
tration procedure, VVeberﬁsaid,‘ was 
made because the University wanted
to clear the student body of unsub-,_
stantiated charges of “radicalism” ‘by’
placing it on record as being loyal to
the University and its.policies. ‘ 0:
“The actions of minority .groupsVon'
the campus too often have_ -been mi-s ,
interpreted as representative -of the»-

“We know there is not ‘a more ,0

This plan will enable any student who possesses a bachelors degree in move‘; into new and large? éflartegg This event Wm be followed by a

engineering from any accredited school or university to complete the re-
quirements for the Master’s degree in one year of study. Until this year it
was impossible for a student to acquire his master’s degree in one year, as
the Schools of Engineering and Mines%

were offering only partial courses.
_ The year’s scholastic program lead-
ing to the degree of master of science

in the particular branch of engineer- .

- ing in which the student is registered,
will be divided into two semesters ‘of
ﬁfteen credits each. Persons register-
ing for graduate study may take a
partial course and extend their period
of study for the degree over more
than one year.

R-equire Nine Major Credits.
During a semester each student
must complete six. to nine credits of
work in the graduate courses of their

‘ major department, three to six credits‘

in graduate courses and electives in
other departments, and ‘three credits
in thesis work. E
The departinents offering full grad-
uate programs include: civil, mechan-
ical,_ electrical, chemical, industrial,
and _mining engineering, and also the
"departments of metallurgy, oil and

9 gas production, andpetroleum reﬁn-

ing. .

- The "department of civil engineering

. offers, seven graduate courses each
semeste-r. The mechanical engineer-
ing department is giving eight courses
each‘ semester. The departments of
electrical, chem_i__cal, industrial, and
mining engineering, respectively, are
offering thirteen, six, ten, and six
courses the’ ﬁrst semester; .~ﬁve,- six,
ten, and -six courses the second se-
mester. v

E The metallurgy. and “oil and gas pro-
‘ iductiondepartments are each oﬁering
, ten courses both semesters while the

department of petroleum reﬁning is

L’ ‘ . , ;giving.Iive__,courses.

_Any cours"e~will be given provided

' eight or more students register. _
In conjunction ‘with the \graduate
program, the University and the
Westingliouse Electric and Manufac-
turing Company are giving coopera-
tive graduate courses. These courses
are open to all graduates of recog-
nized Engineering and
Schools. _ _
Arrangle Cooperative Work

. A A  , Engineering cooperative training at
‘=-s\*_.1?itt was begun in 1910, but remained
' - vfpurely undergraduate in character un-

til. 1927. That year» Pitt ﬁrst offered,
through’ its graduate school, a dis-
tinctly graduate cooperative program
‘of engineering education. This was

 _ accomplished through the joint partic-

Technical '

Westinghouse employes, from time to
time others have been permitted to
register.

The courses of the cooperative pro-
gram are a part of the regular even-

ing instruction in "graduate engineer-

ing studies leadingto the Master of
Science -degree.
Director Coler ls «Instructor.

Among the administrative oﬂicers of
the program are_ Carl Seymour Coler,
Director of the Department of Educa-
tion at the Westinghouse Company
and director of Westinghouse Courses
at Pitt, and Dr. Emerson Bryan Rob-
erts, assistant to Dr. Coler.

Dr. Arpad Naidi, Westinghouse Lec-
turer in Mechanical Engineering,’ is
one of the best-known members of the
faculty. Dr.‘Naidi, who received‘ his
early training in Europe, has been a
research engineer at the Westing-
house Company for ﬁve years. He is
an internationally known authority on
the theory and the application ofwthe
theory of elasticity. He is the author
of several text books. . .

Dr. Espon Fortescue is known as an
authority in mathematical analysis.
Dr. Fortescue graduated Queens Col-'
lege, Ontario, Canada. He holds the
position of consulting engineer at the
We‘sti1igliouse Company, is teaching a
course on the application of differen-
tial equations to Electrical Circuits.

A course in the problems of the sale
and distribution of engineering equip-
ment and machinery is a new course.
This "will mark the ﬁrst time that
such a course has ever been ‘offered
on any campus. It will be taught by
Mr. Bernard Lester, assistant sales
manager in the industrial department
at the Westinghouse Company.

Dr. Rudolph Emil Hellmund, chief
electrical engineer at the Westii1g-
house Company, is ‘another expert
who will offer a course. He has been
with the company for over twenty
years. -

Dr. William Abbett Lewis, general
engineer at Westinghouse, will teach
a class in Symmetrical Components.
Dr. Lewis graduated from California
Institute of ‘Technology. . - «

Mr. Adolphus. Mansﬁeld Dudley, Su-
pervisor of Engineering at Westing-
house and an employe there for over
twenty-ﬁve years, is with Dr. Hell-
mund, instructing classes in Electrical

on the 11th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of smoker for men on Thursday evening

Learning, is preparing to set up a
ﬁeld artillery research laboratoryhin
one of the rooms of the new military
department. - ‘ --

The laboratory equipment will con-
sist of relief maps, sand tables, com-
putators, and model trench workings.
All of this equipment has been prop-
erly scaled and will give both the ele-

mentary and advanced students" in the ’

R. O. T. C. an opportunity to practice
war games and maneuvers somewhat
like the real ﬁeld artillery work for
which they are training. .

= Colonel Cullen anticipates ~an in-
crease in the enrollment of the Pitt R.
O. T. C. making thelocal unit one of
the largest among schools where mili-
tary training is not compulsory.

‘$10 Prize Next Week

 

Pitt’s semi-weekly publication re-
mains without a name.

Because of registration week rush,
together.‘-with the usual getting un-
packed“ stir, meeting of old cronies
and.» new. friends, late arrivals, and
general scarcity of the ﬁrst issue of
‘the new _semi-weekly paper, so few
votes were cast in the weekly name
contest during last week that the ex-
utive ‘board has decided to continue
the contest for another week.

The '.‘Pitt_ Weekly name contest”
will be oflicially brought to a close,
‘Saturday. ‘October 1, at noon. All
votes cast during ‘registration week
have _been set aside. Those voting
during that week will have another
-chance to win the prize oﬁered for a
name for the semi-weekly.

Award $10 Prize.

Thisprize of ten dollars will be
awarded‘ the student suggesting the
best name to supplant “Pitt Weekly”
as the name of the weekly publica-
tion, which has ceased to exist.

, Judges in the name contest will be

weekly composed of Wilfred I. _Ber-
:man,.Co1. ’33; Thomas B. Cummings,

Whatever" hopes Ohio Northern _Uni-

were crushed after‘ the ﬁrst few min-
utes of Saturday's game.

_ After that .fumble by Heller in the
fourth play of the game, which was
recovered by -Shipe of Ohio, the
Panthers‘ shook off their ﬁrst game
nervousness and settled down to the
business of getting touchdowns. After
the clock had ticked out the game’s
60 minutes of play and Coach Suther-
land had cleared the bench of players,
the Panthers had garnered «seven
touchdowns; two in the ﬁrst and sec-
ond quarters, one in the third, and
two more in, the last period of play,

and third stringers marched down the.

of the game. fans were found to re-
mark that Piitt need not be afraid of

.Just what the net result will be
against that opposition is just now a
matter of conjecture.

The ‘Heller to Reider passing com-
bination accounted for a touchdown in
the ﬁrstquarter of the game. Too, the
Heller to Skladany combination
worked almost equally well. Wein-
stock, starting the game, in the ab-
sence of Johnnie Luch, acted like’a
seasoned trooper in crashing the game
Ohio’s line and accounting for one of
the seven touchdowns and making four
of the six extra tries after touchdowns.

A question which startled the world
when engineers were put on trial for
their lives,-charged with sabotaging
Russia's Five Year Plan, has been
made the basis for the latest sound-

For‘ the ﬁrst time, the tragic and
heroic personal drama that often un-
derlies the gigantic projects of The
Five Year Plan, has been fully told
in this picture.  ~

The story starts in the present, but
by a skillful story device, the scenes
swing back and forth between excit-

and the no less~‘tense drama of the
building of modern industry.

IT IS going to be difﬁcult for many undergraduate men students
who do not live in Pittsburgh to obtain even part-time employment in
the city this year. A large number of these students are wholly de-
pendent upon arrangements which will e.nable'them to earn their liv-
ing. One way University people can help these boys is to take them
into their homes and give them either or both room and board in
exchange for services rendered. The urgency for this kind of help
is ' great. Members of the faculty can furtheraid such a. plan by -
calling it to the attention of their friends outside the University.
The Employment Bureau for Men will act as a. clearing house. ' Tele-
phone the Employment Bureau and make known your needs.
