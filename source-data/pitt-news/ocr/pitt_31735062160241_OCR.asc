Publications Board. Wants Decision By. June

Special Committee Considers

New Student Mag Next Week

A publications board special committee is wasting no time before taking up the ques-
tion of whether Pitt will have a student magazine to succeed the recently-banned Panther.
‘Prof. Robert X. Graham, head of the magazine committee, today asked the six other
members of his group to meet on the question early next week.
The committee’s discussions will include four‘ major points:

Engineers
Win Senior

High Awards  

The Engineering and Mines As-
lociation announced today that
nine seniors are receiving “out-
standing engineering s e n i o r”
awards.

The ~ awardees are Nicholas J.
Baresky, Arthur E. Mikolait, Rob-
ort E. Cook, William J. Hahne, Ed-
win A. Flockhart, James E. Frei-
ser, John V. Reihing Jr., and The-
odore J. Kisiel, and Julius P. Pe-
line. a .

A committee of faculty and stu-
dents chose the men for the
wards.

 

After Hustling
Blood Donors,
Rocks Collapse

When only 50 people had «-
donated_ blood last Tuesday
for the Pitt Blood Drive,
Chairmen Gene Rock and Jim
Rock decided something dras-
tic had to be done to make the
drive a success.

"Phoning all fraternity presi-
dents, ODK, Alpha Phi Omega,
and Student Congress mem-

bers, the two men succeeded
in rounding up 330 blood
donors.

After such hard work on
their part. the two exhausted
Rocks fainted when their turn _

“came to donate blood.

(1); Whether or not to recom-
mend that the publications board
establish a new magazine.

(2) What type of magazine
should be recommended.

(3) Whether to interview stu-
dent applicants for positions of
editor and business manager.

(4) Whether to recommend a
speciﬁc format and editorial pol-
icy for the magazine.

The committeefs job will be to
make recommendations to the 21'-
member publications board, which
must make the ﬁnal decision on
the establishment of the new mag-
azine. '

‘Mr. Graham said that the pur-
pose of the early meeting is to en-
able the publications board to

reach a decision and select offi-

cers" for the new magazine before
the end of the semester.

The journalism professor added
that if his committee does decide‘
next week to recommend the es-
tablishment of a magazine, candi-
dates for editor and business man-
ager will probably be heard the
week of May 19-23.

Mr. Graham said that any
student, Panther staffer or not,
who wants to apply for editor or
business manager should contact
him or another member of the
committee as soon as possible.

Sells at Carnival

The ﬁnal edition of the Pan-
ther, student humor magazine,
will go on sale at Spring Carnival
next week.

The Festival edition of the mag-
azine, which will not be published
after this semester, will be, ac-
cording to Editor Paul Schwarz,
“the type of humor magazine the
student will be glad to show his
family, and one which campus
organizations will be proud to
sell.”

Poll Finds Panther Not Mourned

Students Want New Mag at Pitt

By DAVE GREEN

Pitt students differ widely as to
what type of magazine they would
like to see on campus’ next year,
but few seem to mourn the pass-
ing of the Panther.

As far as to the type and extent
of humor, risque material is not
too popular. .

Betty Ann Rolf, Bus. Ad., ’53
asked, “Why can’t it be a humor
‘magazine, as long as it doesn’t
have the ﬁlth the Panther had?”
Others more speciﬁcally ‘out-
lined their aims.
Mark Nagy, College, '54 said, “I’d
like’ to see one that the University
could be proud of—-one that could
even be sent to high schools for
publicity.”
James Strobeck, College, ’52 says
that it should have “Short humor-

Arden Elkins, College, ’54 asked,
-“Why does it have to be humor?
,I’d like something literary. It
could include some humorous ma-
terial, but the magazine should be
classiﬁed as literary.” -

Lloyd Fuge, College ’54 urged,

“Something of a literary sort. It ‘

should present articles and stories
in a light vain, but with some real
worth.

Jack Sitler, College ’54, asked for
more of a news journal, “with
short biographies of interesting
people on campus and more pic-
tures of students and student ac-
tivities. It should have more items
about projects of fraternities, clubs
and the various schools. What

Q .
By GENE WEINSTEIN

If it is true that variety is the
spice of life, then J . Fred Lissfelt

‘has led an amply seasoned exist-
ance. The si1ver—haired French
and-German teacher not only is an
author, expert gardener, and ex-

_ interpreter for the U.S. Army, but
is recognized as one of the most
‘prominent ﬁgures in‘ Pittsburgh

A musical circles. '

For 30 years Mr. Lissfelt has
been music critic for the Sun-
Telegraph and its predecessors.
And the much-traveled instructor

\ is well qualiﬁed for the job.

, Studied Abroad

Born in what was then Pitts-
burgh’s “Germantown,” the South-
side,( young Lissfelt studied in
Leipzig, Salzburg, and Paris, and

subsequently visited Europe for
seven consecutive summers. It
was then that he met many of the
artists who now are the leaders in
contemporary music.

Among these were Lilli Leh-
mann, the great Wagnerian so-
prano, Schumann-Heink, a con-

,tralto, and Wanda Landowska,

one standard reply, “Perhaps.” '

Despite the sentiment and the

Mr. Lissfelt rates Pinza and

thing we’ve had from Europe.”

“Pops” Criticized

“Too much of popular music to-

of the group for greater student
representation might even be ac-
complished before the semester is
out. “We hope to have the stu-
dents vote on new by-laws in two
or three weeks,’ he said.

' Passage Expected

In a student poll conducted by
Congress this year, a majority of
students indicated that they would
like to see a’ great student rep-
resentation on the governing body.
Burwinkle thinks that the new by-
laws will be adopted by the stu-
dnts “without any trouble.”

Second largest project for SC,
according to Burwinkle, will be to
instill "more “pep” into the stu-
dents at Pitt. “That, is a big job,”
he said, ,“and we think we have
the type of programs that will do
it.”

As for the highly controversial

"political clubs which were denied

students this semester, Burwin-
kle said “SC will decide whether
to support their recognition when
the time comes.”

He stated that he was person-
ally ih favor of the clubs, as are
most Congress members, but that
“we will decide later on the par-
ticular merits ‘of the proposal.”

As for Men’s Council, its_newly
elected president, Ronald Ecker,
said that he is “determined to see

a workable enforcement of fresh-

will propose holding upperclass
court every week, checking of the
English classes, and stationing
checkers on the freshmen—denied
ODK walk. ‘

“Any freshman who is cited
for a second offense will have it
placed on his permanent‘ rec-
ord,” Ecker said.

Men’s Council is also hoping to

change the location of its book-

store from the eight ﬂoor to the

ground ﬂoor, with the hope that
they can use part of the check-
room facilities for this purpose. , .

Combos Promised

Ecker also promised eight mixer
dances with a combo for each
dance, improved lounge facilities,
and “better MC sponsored affairs
all around.”

Applications for chairman of the
different MC posts ‘will be re-

ceived at the next meeting of the

group,.today at 3:30 pm.

This is probably the last editorial the cur-
rent editor .will contribute to this side of the
page. Henceforth, ‘John Kulamer must ac-
cept either the praise or the blame for the
opinions expressed here.

Throughout the year we have tried to ex-
press honest, intelligent opinions; laboring

C, under the somewhat optimistic assumption

that our words could influence the people

~ who chanced across them. We are aware
that sometimes we have been out of step

with our readers, occasionally in step, and
often neither in step nor out of step_with
anyone in particular. We are neither com-

pletely happy nor unduly dismayed about
t the results. One gets realistic about edit— .

orials, . /
We are convinced that history will com-
pletely disregard the stands we have t-aken.-

. But ignoring the immediate and ultimate ef-

fects ‘of our editorials, we have found com-

, posing them a diverting and satisfying chore,

one of the more pleasant features of the job.
We hope our successor ﬁnds them as satis-

A T . fying.

We think that this sideof the page‘ is in
good hands and we hope that you are as

T tolerant with him as you have been with us.

[At long last i

A long overdue event came to pass at the

» tapping ceremonies last Wednesday. There is

a large chunk of the student body that’s
been wondering why it didn’t happen soon-
er. To them, the tapping of Cyril Wecht to

QDK must-‘have come as a relief. We know _
9 it"1did to us. - '

Why the male bluebloods of the campus

a had up to now carried their bypassing of

Wecht to the point of outright snubbing is
one of those knotty puzzles that refuses to
get solved. Some say he has political ene-
mies. He probably has. Anyone as active as
Wecht is bound to make séme. But to ad-
mit that a political falling-out is sufficient
to block a man from ODK is to imply that
‘thehonorary frat is an instrument of politi-
cal patronage, which all its members would
furiously deny, and which it patently is not.

It was further suggested that Mr. Wecht

‘ lacksin some way the qualities of leader-

ship required of an ODK man. A quick look
at his record is enough to. convince anyone
with half an eye that this argument can’t
stand up. Among __other things, he is, or
was; president of YMCA, president of Phi
Eps, president of the Universityiorchestra,
president of Druids,“ president of Student
Congress, audience manager for the Pitt
Plavers, and business staffer of the Pitt News.

But anyway, it ﬁnally happened. The tap-

ping, hand has fallen on Wecht’s shoulder, '

and public acknowledgement been given to
his right to stand‘ on the top rung. It’s about
time.

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS,

Iy amen:

"H's nothing. red|ly—l gave them 100 multiple-choice
questions-—bu+ none of the answers are right."

Found :S 

The recent Writers Conference
managed quite adequately», the
problem of writing and market-
ing the English language. But
none of the assembled agents,
poets or profs was able to shed
any light on the ultimate role
of the writ- '
ing major in§
the scheme of 
our capitalis '
tic society. ‘

I ’ th i n k ,
however, that
*~_ have found
the ﬁnal stop-
ping-off place
of one Pitt
writing major.
He went into
the restaurant r
business. Naturally, being an
esthetic person, he didn’t select
such a mundane phase of the
eating business as cooking or
busboying. He remaineda writ-
er, a menu writer to be exact.

This writing major-——unidenti-,

_, ﬁed and unsung—has utilized

his artistic training to compose
one of the most lyrical menus in
the city, a rhapsodic hymn to
the glories of his employer’s
victual. He displays a clean,
vigorous line and a certain depth

. of feeling, felictiously combin-

ed wtih a warm appreciation of
the palate and a-keen ear for the
subtleties of the language.

He uses all of the tricks of the
trade: connotations, concrete de-
tails, speciﬁc instances, descrip-
tion, narration,
even» argumentation when the
eater may be undecided. For his

vmost telling points he makes am-

ple use of onamatopoeia. His
opus swells to one ‘grand and
triumphant invitation to partake
of the wonders of food; delicious,
delightful, delectable food; oh,
food, thou hast Wravished my
heart! - .

His scorcery almost compels\
the reader to drink, hugigry or.

no. Look what he does to a pro-
saic glass of totmato juice by in-
vesting it with hitherto un-
dreamed of qualities. It is an
“invigorating health juice.” He
holds out the opportunity of re-
viving a parched throat and sag-
ging spirit and improving your
health by drinking a mere glass
of the juice from the tomato. _
Most of us will agree that a
chop has its compensations, but
under his cunningit becomes the
very source of Western Civiliza-
tion. It’s a “juicy, ruddy, brown

-chop from the heart of the loin.”

student ever succeeded so well
in translating his lectures into
use as our menu artist does. A
“spaghetti plate” is a “heaping
platter of yard-long Italian mas-
terpieces,” Boston Beans are

“carefully mellowed,” a Frank- 

furter is “plump and tasty,” a
Butt Steak is described as “juicy
tender selected,” Chili Con Carne
is “tempting” and “seasoned ac-
cording to an authentic South
of the Border recipe.” ‘

Our poet found words"inade-
quate for the house’s -“Delicious
Buttermilk Pancakes” so he nail-
ed it down‘ with simply “um-
m-m.” Again when he was fac-
ed with the impossible task of
attributing a ‘superior quality

to the French Toast he found_

that he had to sum it _up with
“Um-my-m.”
just as good as the Buttermilk
Cakes it was not superior so he
solved the ticklish matter of pro-
tocol _by saying “um-m—m
again!” As you noted he used
puncuation to fortify the impres-
sion by using an. exclamation
mark.

Sometimes he assumes the
reader has already tasted of the
delights of a particular morsel
and he merely anticipates the re-
action by saying “Delicious, a
real treat.” I noticed, though,
that he let the “French Fried
Bermuda Rings” go by without
comment. This could mean that
not even he is incapable of ris-
ing to the adjectivial task or that
he doesn’t like onions.’

Some of his comments have
an authoritarian‘ ring. In dis-
cussing the merits of “Cottage
Cheese and Pineapple” he be-
gins by stating that it is “a posi-
tive favorite, refreshing and de-
lightful” and ends by insisting
that it is “delightful to any pal-
ate.” I noticed in one section
that he was compelled to come
down to earth but here he was
not dealing with food and he dis-

played a tactfulness rarely seen -

in ordinary eating places. In

‘ large boldface type he informs

the epi . . . that the management

(is (‘Not responsible for the loss

JACK MARKOWITZ

The publications board committee which next 

week takes up the idea of establishing a new maga-

zine to succeed the fallen Panther will probably it “C
enter on its task with some misgivings. That will /X
be because the Panther’s maltreatment of the boardf

in the past has been most distressing.

Every year, when new candidates for editortand T

business manager. came before '
the board,,they were acquainted:
with a few ideals that the maga
zine was expected to have. I
was supposed to be a feature
picture magazine “depicting the;
lighter side of student life.” ,
But after the editors got into '
office, their young fancies lightly
turned to thoughts of sex. To
the board’s chagrin, this"history

repeated itself several years running”, and the pa,-«
tient board-last week ﬁnally told the Panthento‘ ,

go away from this place. .

A vivid memorypof the Panther’—s perﬁdious his . .
tory will probably give the new magazine comi ~ ~
mittee some pause next week. They will be wor-~
ried that the editors of a new sheet may explain:
their plans to the board in the most angelic terms," 
and ‘then, after getting _into oﬁice, take what the“,
Newman Club calls “the line of least“ rtesistancje-"_
and start writing about you know what. The spectre ‘
oftsubject matter that is “vulgar, base, andjre- .

pulsive” looms large.

In order to insure that the new magazine 
stay clean, the committee may decide to ‘state

deﬁnitely and narrowly the specific subject mat-j . L

ter that will be permitted. .

A “feature—photo” type of content seems to be ~ 

the most popular idea at present, and if ‘the new
editors are instructed not to stray. from that for-

mat, the magazine is almost certainlnot to enter-.", '

the danegerous regions of “off-color.”
But the committee has it in its power to recom-3

mend a magazine of much greater potentiality‘: )
‘ and worth than a photo—feature type.

Since the main drawback of the Panther was
its use of low’ humor, that is the only kind at
material. that need be forbidden to the new sed-
itors. N . ’

The committee should not only permit but en-
courage a magazine of wide latitude in’ subject
matter—of wider latitude than the Panther which
wasalmost completely humor. ’ ‘

‘ The new editors should be permitted tolllrun.

‘literary, editorial, photographic, -controversial, and

feature material, and even humor——clean humor,

By offering a magazine that appeals to varied tastes
and utilizes varied talents, the publications ‘board

would not have to fear embarrassment or irate.

telephone calls from protective parents.

A new publication is a much-needed and poten-

tially beneﬁcial thing. Pitt should not allow. itself
to be without a student magazine.

CLARK -SUTTON

Time will only tell whether Jack Burwinkle

will ‘equal Cyril Wecht as president of Student Con-
gress, but he already ties a far better necktie than
his predecessor. As a matter :of fact, one of the

few times that a large majority of students saws
Wecht with his necktie knotted at all was at the ,

recent Tap, Day ceremonies.

It will be to Wecht’s lasting;

credit that he was able to ac
complish as much as he did de
spite the fact that, as far as poli
tical dress is concerned; he was’
a revolutionist. His habit of
loosening his tie and opening his
collar‘ is pure sacrilege in Pitt
political ranks. T

sists of a business suit, slightly wrinkled by t e
end of the week, traditional button-down collar,
and ultra-conservative tie. Wecht is the only stu-

out his tie neartly knotted, ever-prepared for“*a
chance meeting with Dr. Fitzgerald.

Burwinkle, on the other hand, will never achieve
the care—free dress of Wecht, but he can be ex-
pected to r"‘ some variety to the political style.
He 0‘ ; he owns ﬁve suits,‘ a sports jacket, and

Everything will be Varsity next Wednesday.

. That’s the day the Panther Club has designated
as the second annual Varsity Day—Pitt’s athletic
parallel to Tap Day.

. True to its name, the Varsity agenda calls /for
the long-awaited dedication of Varsity Walk and

ceremonies under Varsity Tree.

The ceremonies will start at noon under Var-
sity Tree, the ﬁrst elm along Varsity Walk which
runs parallel to ODK Walk on the Belleﬁeld St.
side of the Cathedral. ,.

Highlighting, the ceremonies will be the
presentation of : the Charles C. Hartwig Me-
morial Trophy and an award to the Outstand-
ing Athlete of the Year, both, awardees to be
named by the Athletic Committee.

The Hartwig Trophy, instituted last year, is an
annual award given to thesenior who has done. the
most to promote the interest of athletics at the
University ‘during his college career. ‘

It is presented‘ in honor of the former Pitt

for the citing of Pitt’s letter-winning athletes in.

 

A thletes. Cited on Wednesday

All-American guard of 1933-34, who died two years

ago after a long illness. Mrs. Hartwig, wife of the p A

late gridder, will present the Trophy.

The recipient, along with the awardee of the
Outstanding Athlete award, is to have his name

inscribed in V,_arsity Walk. » '
Last year, Sam Shapiro ‘won the I-Iartwig

award. Former Outstanding Athlete citations  J
gone to George Badosevich last year and to Bimbo

Cecconi in 1950. .

The past awardees will have their name in-
scriptions_ uncovered for the first time on Wed-3
nesday when the Walk is officially dedicated.

The Walk will be inscribed much like ODK
Walk except in the layout of the names. The
names will be inscribed ‘lengthwise because,
as Jack Hardman, former Panther Club presl- I
dent puts it, “Some of the names are too long.”

“ The latest project of the Club was the »initia- 

tion of seven new members Wednesday. The inla-

tiates were: John George, Harvey Rabinowitz‘,
Henry Ford, Paul Blanda, Harold Miller, Bill Ad-r

ams, and Tony Romantino.

For Those With Itchy Feet

living with people from all 0Vci‘
the world.

Great Britain, Europe, and
Scandinavia. are offering courses
this year which are tops in edu-
cational and social values.

Five British schools are holding
summer sessions for 1952. The
universities of Birmingham, Lon-
don, Nottingham, Oxford, and St.

eAndrews will feature classes in

Shakespeare, economic reconstruc-

tion, and English education.

Placement Limited

Because placement in British
summer sessions is limited in
number of foreign students, and
because of the small number of
available, students
must apply beforehand. A student
registration card often helps in
getting reduced p'assage*' fare for
other schools as well. ‘

The tuition for a regular six-
weeks British summer session,
including classes and room and
board in dormitories, is about
$180.

For the student with a ﬂair for
languages, European s u in me r
schools offer beginning courses,
and for the advanced linguist,
courses in the “civilization” of a

. particular country.

Supplementary Courses

Dr. Carlo Sciﬁfo, now at Pitt
from the University of Florence,
Italy, points out the supplement-
ary courses which complement
language study. The school’s trips
to museums, churches, and libra-
ries, all of which are a part of the
summer study, enliven the courses
and create interest in more ad-
vanced phases of each ‘subject, he
says. L _

Registration at European sum-
mer schools is done on arrival,

, and may be made for as little as

two’ weeks, depending upon the

length of the course. Room and

board, usually with families, is the
most costly item. Thexliving ex-
penses depend on the family’s de-
cision. As for tuition, costs also

Reihing Wins

Penn Prize

Omicron Delta Kappa. After grad-
uation, he plans to work for Bell
Telephone Laboratories.

This is the second consecutive
year that a Pitt electrical engi-
neering student has won first prize
at the contest. Howard R. Still-
well won second prize in 195-0, and

Summer School Horizons Broaden

By BEA PAUL
Most college students at some time wonder what it
would be like to travel and learn in a foreign country. Though
it is not often possible to get complete college training abroad,
many students are using their summers for ' studying and

structor Leon Bachrach have all
attended the Summer School for
the American students.

Tuition Higher

Tuition for Scandinavian schools
is somewhat higher than the Euro-
pean. Room and board is with
families, except in Oslo, where
dorms are available.

Due to the increasing number of
American students going abroad
each year, more student ships are
arranging passages. General round
trip fare for a student ship is about
$300, with prices slightly higher to
Scandinavia.
