VOLUME EIGHTY-TWO, ISSUE EIGHTY-SIX

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Members of the Dar Essalam
Mosque and the Muslim Stu-
dent Association took to the
streets again last Friday to pro-
test the treatment of Arabs in
the Israeli—occupied territories.

Protesters representing the
entire Islamic world as well as
American supporters carried
signs that depicted the abuse
of Arabs in the West Bank and
Gaza by the Israeli army.
Some of the marchers carried
the Palestinian national flag. In
the occupied territories it is
illegal to display the Palestini-
an flag or any other material
espousing Palestinian na-
tionalism.

Frank Smith, a sophomore
biology major married to an
Iranian woman, said he came
to the march because, ”I have
always been sympathetic to
the Palestinian people.”

Muhammad Najaab, a
spokesman for the mosque,
said the Muslim community in
Pittsburgh is very concerned
about the plight of the Pales-
tinians in Israel.

Mohammed El-Banna, presi-
dent of the Muslim Students
Association, said, ”The upris-
ing is a harvest of Israeli op-
pression. They [Palestinians]
should have the right to self-
determination.”

Palestinian groups marched through Oakland last Friday to protest Israeli policies toward
Arabs in the territories occupied by the Israeli army.

West Bank, said, ”I don't think
the Jews want to give anything
up. The fight has nothing to do
with religion. The Jews took
our land and we want it
back/’

Abu Khalid, a senior from
Gaza, said three Israeli soldi-
ers once came into to his fa-
mily's house at 3 a.m. and
demanded to be served coffee.
”We are human beings. Why
do they [Israelis] take our
rights?” '

Hassan Mahmood, a U.S.
citizen originally from the
West Bank, said Arab-
Americans who visit Israel are
harassed by the Israeli govern-
ment. ”lt’s a fact of everyday
life," he said.

Members of Hillel, a Jewish

students’ organization, were
unable to agree on a statement
to respond to the Palestinian’s
protest.

Leon Morris, a member of
Hillel, hung an Israeli flag and
a banner that read ”peace” in
Arabic, Hebrew and English.
He said that he wanted to
show that there are Zionists
who want to see a negotiated

settlement in the Middle East.

”As a Jew, I hold Israel to a
higher standard of morality
than other countries, and I
think a lot of this is very un-
fair," he said.

Police estimate that 130
people participated in the
march. The same organiza-
tions marched for Palestinian 4
rights last Jan. I.

Pitt medical school receives grant to study diabetes

By Scot Ross

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, in coopera-
tion with the Pittsburgh Diabetes
Center, is currently testing the ef-
fectiveness of a new drug to com-
bat the symptoms of diabetic
neuropathy.

Over one-third of the I2 mil-
lion Americans afflicted with di-
abetes experience some form of
diabetic neuropathy, a type of
nerve impairment where signals
for pain and sensation are unable
to travel through the nervous
system.

University professor of medi-
cine and physiology John E.
Gerich, M.D., said, ”The drug be-

ing tested, statil, inhibits an en-
zyme present in nerves and other
tissues called aldose reductase.
Inhibition of this enzyme in
animal models prevents the
depletion of myoinositol and im-
proves nerve function.”

Primary symptoms of diabetic
neuropathy include tingling and
numbness in the hands and feet.
Increasing pain and, in extreme
cases, loss of sensation and paral-
ysis can occur as the disease
progresses.

Other problems that surface as
a result of the lack of nerve func-
tion include gastro-intestinal dys-
functions, joint destruction,
impotence, foot ulcers and unex-
pected death from cardiac ar-
rhythmias.

Mary Hackimer, statil nurse co-
ordinatior of the Pittsburgh Dia-
betes Center, reports that neu-
ropathy affecting the nerves
”usually occurs in someone who
has had diabetes more than IO
years.”

She added, ”The problem with
[diabetic neuropathy] is that peo-
ple can lose sensations in the
ends of their fingers and toes,
making them more prone to
injury.”

In addition to the extreme
difficulty in distinguishing be-
tween hot and cold, sufferers can
cut themselves and not know it
because they cannot feel the
pain. Without knowing damage
has occurred, a patient may allow
a wound to go untreated and risks

infection and gangrene, which
often requires amputation of the
affected area.

Hackimer said that 50 to 75
percent of all the amputations
stemming from diabetic neuropa-
thy could be prevented.

At the present time, there is no
cure for diabetic neuropathy;
however, with a $479,000 grant
from the Stuart Pharmaceutical
Company, Pitt researchers are
testing statil, which has shown
promise as a treatment to relieve
the symptoms of neuropathy in
early diagnosed subjects.

Much of the impetus for this
program comes from the physi-
cal, as well as emotional scars
that diabetes brings.

Pitt graduate student Susan
Saidman commented on her dia-

betic condition: ’’It affects my life
style, what I eat, when I eat and
my blood sugar.”

Saidman said that her major
medical insurance covers her
medical bills for her condition,
which she estimated in excess of
$100 a month.

Max Ellenberg, M.D., the form-
er president of the American Di-
abetes Association, wrote, ”The
first line of defense against this
neuropathy is to bring diabetes
under good control - ideally
from the onset of the disease.
Good control may not be able to
undo damage that has already
been done, but many researchers
studying diabetes control suspect
that it may slow and perhaps halt
the complication’s process.”

Pittsburgh rapist gets 80 to 160 year sentence

PITTSBU RCJH -- A rapist who
stalked women in grocery store
parking lots has been sentenced
to 80 to 160 years in prison.

”Millar(l Bowles, you are a
walking crime wave,” Judge
Robert E. Dauer said. ’’I hope you
serve every moment of it.”

Bowles, 27, of suburban Bethel
Park, was convicted in January of
kidnapping two women at
knifepoint and sexually assaulting
them in separate incidents on
March 19 and April 7.

Bowles forced the women to
withdraw cash from automated
teller machines after the. attacks,
police said.

Despite the brutality of the as-
saults, Bowles would leave his
telephone number with the vic-
tims or try to call them later to ar-
range another meeting, police
said.

Delvalle in hiding as
Panama strife goes on

PANAMA CJTY, Panama -
Deposed president Eric Arturo
Delvalle stayed in hiding Sunday
and defied Gen. Manuel Antonio

Noriega, the military strongman
who ousted him and ordered him
out of the country.

The ex—president’s where-
abouts were a closely guarded
secret, but family members said
he was in a ”safe and secure
place” in Panama, in ”good
spirits” and determined to regain
his job.

’’I am going to stay here [and]
stick it out,” Delvalle told ABC
television in a telephone inter-
view Saturday night. ’’I’m going
to fight it all the way.”

Delvalle did not reveal his bid-
ing place.

Roderick Esquivel, Delva|le’s
vice president, was also in hiding.

Both men were ousted early
Friday in an action by the Nation-
al Legislative Assembly orches-
trated by Noriega, the Defense
Forces chief.

Delvalle ignited the latest cri-
sis in eight months of continuing
civil unrest in Panama on Thurs-
day when he tried to fire Norie-
ga, who is charged in Florida with
corruption and narcotics traffick-
ing. The United States also has
urged Noriega to step down as

military chief.

On Friday, Delvalle returned to
his home in an upper-class neigh-
borhood. Police surrounded the
house Friday evening and Del-
val|e’s telephone lines were cut,
leaving him incomrnunicado and
under an undeclared house
arrest.

Sometime that night, he report-
edly climbed over a patio wall at
the rear of the house and escaped
through a neighbor’s yard, avoid-
ing the policemen who had been
posted on the street in front of his
home.

Chrysler workers mad
over proposed cuts

DETROJT — Chrysler Corpora-
tion's plans to close a Wisconsin
assembly plant and its admission
that it might sell its Acustar Inc.
parts subsidiary are fueling wor-
ker anger and distrust as the two
sides head into this summer's na-

tional contract talks.

Chrysler's parts operations
were grouped into the subsidiary
last spring, but most of Acustar’s
28,()()() workers have been with
Chrysler since it battled back
from the brink of bankruptcy ear-
ly in the decade, when they
granted concessions to keep the
company afloat.

Chrysler workers think the
potential sale, now that the No.
3 carmaker is again earning
billion-dollar profits, indicates
they won't be able to trust the
company in the contract negoti-
ations.

More than 1,000 workers vent-
ed their anger last week outside
Chrysler’s Highland Park head-
quarters, waving signs and shout-
ing “Strike! Strike!” at an
emotional rally led by United
Auto Workers Vice President
Marc Stepp.

One sign read: ”Concessions In
'79, The Shaft ln '88."

Stepp, who will lead negotia-
tions with Chrysler, said he will
give UAW locals permission to
strike on a plant—by-plant basis,
based on local disagreements but

Scientists argue over
mankind's evolution

l’l"llLADEl_PHlA ——- The debate
over the origin of mankind may
be age-old, but scholars are still
warm to the subject as evidenced
by a weekend debate that evoked
comments like ”screwy” and
”wacko” in response to new
theories.

Although not the only topic dis-
cussed, the question of whether
all humans evolved from a single
female prompted much heated
discussion at an all—day symposi-
um at the University of Pennsyl-
vania’s museum.

The so-called Eve theory is ”a
really wacko idea,” said Milford

Wolpoff, a paleoanthropologist. ‘

Clarification

ln the February 24 issue of The Pitt
News the headline ”Jewish settler ac-
cused of murder” on page 1 was in-
accurate. The Jewish settler was
actually accused of fatally shooting
a 13-year-old Arab girl, not of
murder.

Yolanda King stresses importance of Black History A

By Marc Hopkins
Staff Writer

"It's good to be back here; I’m
becoming a regular,” said Yolan-
da King as she spoke before an
audientje in the William Pitt Un-
ion Thursday evening, in a pro-
gram sponsored by the Black
Action Society honoring Black

V History Month.

King, the oldest daughter of the
slain Civil rights leader Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., opened her
lecture. by stressing the impor-
tance of Black History Month.

”Some might question the sig-
nificance of setting aside a month
to study our past, but this should
not be once a year, an annual ob-
servance in February, the short-
est month of the year; it should
be an ongoing quest,” said King.

Quoting Malcom X, King said,
”People cannot know where they
are going unless they know
where they have been.”

Touching on the effect brought
on by a lack of cultural
knowledge, King said, "He who
controls the image controls the
mind; if people believe they have
no significance in life, there is no
need to send them to the back
door —- they will make one.”

King also discussed the value of
the Martin Luther King holiday as
a national observance, compar-
ing it to those held for Washing-
ton and Lincoln. ”The birthday is
a symbolic act that assures us this
part of history [the civil rights
movement] will never be for-
gotten.”

”The movement,” said King,
”was the inspiration for the
movements that followed -- the
women's movement and the anti-

war movement. It raised the cons-
ciousness of the world, but we
can’t stop here. Many college stu-
dents are laid back and forget
about the sacrifices made so they
could be laid batik.

”Black students," continued
King, ”are here l)et‘ause a whole
lot of people paid dues and kept
the faith in harder times than we
will ever know. I hope we will
not let the legacy die because we
get tomtortable."

King attacke(,l the government
for supporting what she labeled
as ”misdirected priorities.”

”We have taken direction from
the top,” said King. ”Our priori-
ties are warped, allowing 30 per-
cent of the population in the
United States to be functionally
illiterate. The United States has
the highest mortality rates for any
industralized country in the
world. Due to our concern for
profits, we allow children to die
before they're born.”

King reminded the audience
that racism still divides our soci-
ety, citing Arizona's non-
recognition of the King Holiday
by Governer Evan Mecham, cross
burnings on college campuses
and the derogatory remarks made
by Jimmy ”the Greek” Snyder.

”We, as black people,” said
King, ”have not reached the
promised land; we are still bump-
ing into each other in the
wilderness.”

King went on to say, ”We will
either learn to live together as
brothers and sisters or perish in
the challenge.”

During her address, King called
on college students to organize in
a political body to fight against
cuts in student aid.

Yolanda King speaks at BAS lecture.

”Respond in some kind of
way,” King said. ”The reason
why the right wing grew is be-
cause of political organization.

"We must not allow things to
be as they are; we must not sit
back and wait for someone to
deliver us from evil. We must get
off our apathy and continue with
work that must be done.”

During a question and answer
period, King told the audience
that the desire to struggle for civil
rights was not always a promi-
nent part of her life. ’’I tried to es-
cape it; in college I joined no
organizations. People came to
me and wanted to know about
the movement — I didn't know,
I studied it iust like you.”

Does promiscuity affect popularity with others?

Q: I was yert promiscuous for
a while. I wasn't happy so I
stopped. I decidedl wasn 't going
to be like that anymore. It was
hard and took a long time. The
trouble is, now I am lonely and
afraid I might go back to my old
\\'a\’s. Then, at least, I Ielt that
people wanted me. I know I need
advice, because my problem is
that I can 't find anyone who
wants me for me and not for my

l)()rl\.

A: I think you can change the
way you say "I can't find anyone
who wants me, and not just my
body." Because it is lovely being
wanted for one’s self and one’s
body, too. But for you right now,
it is a question of being wanted
and needed while taking some
time before getting sexually in-
volved again.

My first thought is for you to go
to a priest, minister or rabbi and
tell him or her your problem. The

It is important to have talks
about your situation fairly often
for a while. One dose of advice
isn't enough —- regular reinforce-
ment is needed. Through the cler-

you will find that a lot of people

Lying down with
the dogs of war

America's policy troubles in Nicaragua seem to have repli-
cated themselves in Panama. For the second time in recent
years, the federal government has found themselves with a poor
choice of bedfellows.

In recent weeks, the Justice Department handed down an in-
dictment of Panamanian General Antonio Noriega on charges
of drug-smuggling, influence-selling and profiteering. The in-
dictment alleges that Noriega used his position in Panama to
expedite a large part of the cocaine traffic into the United States
by transporting the drug in diplomatic pouches.

The profits Noriega received from this scheme, operated over
a period of at least 5 years, have been estimated between $7
and $20 million dollars.

Before he came under investigation, Noriega had been a din-
ner guest at the White House and had been an ally of fired Lt.
Col. Oliver North in a plan to train contra rebels in Nicaragua
when such action was outlawed by Congress.

Now that the offending matter has hit the fan, administra-
tion officials have decided to support ousted president Eric Ar-
turo Delvalle, who was forced into hiding this weekend by Gen.
Noriega. The self-imposed exile came as a result of an attempt
on Delvalle’s part to remove Noriega from the governement.
That Delvalle is in hiding and Noriega is marching through the
streets of Panama City shows only how perverted the power
structure of that country has become.

The Johnny-come-lately appearance of an administration play-
ing political catch-up isn't a new phenomenon. Reagan seems

LSD experiences
a flashback here

In Sunday's edition of The Pittsburgh Press, there was an ar-
ticle describing what police officials called an ”alarming” rise
in the use of LSD, especially among adolescents. Since 1985,
police have noticed a dramatic increase in the amount of LSD
available on the streets, especially in suburban areas, the Press
said.

Obviously, when a person gets to college, he or she should
be capable of making his own decisions about using drugs. As
LSD becomes more readily available, however, students may
wish to ask themselves whether they are willing to ingest a drug
that studies have shown to produce a potentially permanent
effect.

The archetypal bartender asks us to ”name our poison," and
for good reason, LSD has gotten a bad name.

sonages of great importance in world his-
tory occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to
add: the first time as tragedy, the second as
farce

HoME££sS
CUZ I'M Too

And our survey says 

The editorial of Feb. 24 by Wil-
liam Young “Are the homeless
the problem?" represents a men-
tality that borders on Herbert
Hooverism. He claims, ”unfor-
tunately, the homeless have no-
where to live and nothing to eat
because they don't want jobs.”
[...]

Among the homeless, 22 per-
cent are working or going to
school full time; 50 percent are
Vietnam veterans; and 33 percent
are mentally handicapped (U.S.
News and World Report, Feb. 29,
1988). There are 1700 homeless
in the Pittsburgh area.

The homeless problem has in-
creased in the '80s partly because
of Reaganomics. Under Reagan,
federal subsidies for low-income
housing have been reduced 60
percent and no new housing has
been built or restored.

There is no reason for the most
powerful nation on earth to have
3 million homeless. Archbishop
Romero of El Salvador summed
up the attitude of people like Wil-
liam Young when he said,
”When I feed the poor, I am a
saint; when i ask why they are
poor, I am a communist."

Until there are economic
equality and civil rights for all,
there will be no justice.

Bill Frizlen
founder, New Student Network

We are writing to express our
utter disgust with William
Young's article concerning the
plight of the homeless. The atti-
tudes expressed therein are per-
fectly representative of the
irrational, upper-middle-class at-
titudes espoused by many of this
nation's policy makers. The tone
of the letter makes it perfectly
clear that the closest Mr. Young
has come to homelessness was
last-year’s campout with his
fraternity’s sister-sorority.

The blatent assertion that lazi-
ness is the foundation of home-
lessness could not be further from
the truth. At one level, it is intui-
tively wrong. Who would prefer
eating in soup lines and out of
garbage cans to holding a job?

Secondly, Mr. Young overlooks
the growing problem of de-

LETTERS

institutionalization. A great per-
centage of the homeless popula-
tion is composed of those who,
due to massive cuts in federal as-
sistance, have been prematurely
expelled from mental facilities.
Tell us, Will, who will hire a per-
son who incessantly rocks back
and forth, who can't maintain a
constant personality, or who has
the mental age of a seven-
year-old?

Yes, Will, you can type up and
hand out a list of jobs to all the
homeless in Oakland. How many
do you think will be able to read
it? If they could, would you hire
an alcoholic who hasn't shaved
or bathed in eight months and
can't form complete sentences?

It is unfortunate that you be-
lieve that the homeless are getting
a free ride. Perhaps you should
check your statistics. For in-
stance, most financial assistance
packages require that the
recipient have some address.
”Cardboard box, Fifth Ave." will
not do. Secondly, one has to be
aware that one is eligible for as-
sistance. Those who can't read
are at a slight disadvantage in that
area.

On the other hand, it is not the
case that all homeless people are
uneducated, insane, unclean or
unworthy of employment. The
fact of the matter is, Will, that
some people can't find jobs. The
economic world is not that kind
to many of us. [...]

Furthermore, not all homeless
are adult. Wise up, Will. There
are plenty of children with home-
less parents. Can you find them
a job? [...]

Groups like the New Student
Network should be praised for
taking the first step towards
heightening public consciousness
of a very serious issue. Without
their actions, your ideas will con-
tinue to be believed and the
homeless will continue to suffer

and die.

Frank Bender, Michelle Marecic,
Carl Craver, Jarle Crocker, Holly
Johnston

I have_one question for William
Young. How is it, sir, that the
homeless can collect money from
the government when, by defini-
tion, they are people who have
no addresses at which they could
receive a check.

It is clear that denial is some-
thing more than a river in Egypt.
Still, it runs wide and deep. Mr.
Young ignores the fact that many
of the homeless are children.
Others are mentally infirm and
many are alcoholics. The home-
less aren't the problem either.

They really don't have secret
post office boxes from which they
get their latest binge money. The
problems facing the homeless are
various, and the soltions are com-
plex. Their lives aren't pleasant
and loafing isn't a luxury that they
have. What is disturbing about
Mr. Young's comments is that he
is so smug about feeling sorry for
the homeless and so comfortable
with his own ignorance.

George Nixon
CA5 '90

Before Mr. Young begins to
make outlandish remarks, he
needs to first do his homework.
Common sense tells us not to ask
people to pull themselves up by
their bootstraps when they don't
have any boots. I invite Mr.
Young to visit our organization
for an in-depth look at the com-

plexity and seriousness involved '

around being hungry and home-
less. [...]

Yes, to build a shanty next to
the Gothic Cathedral might do all
sorts of disturbing things to our
senses. It might become a sight
for sore eyes and might sound
ridiculous but such tactics are
sometimes needed to raise the
consciousness level and touch
the hearts of a complacent
society.

WASHINGTON —— Congress
faces a confusing choice this
week between two rival versions
of a plan to help the Nicaraguan
rebels.

A vote is scheduled for Thurs-
day to decide whether the U.S.—
backed Contras will get an aid
package drafted by House
Democrats, a similar one drawn
up by House Republicans, or
nothing at all.

Current authority to aid the

Contra aid pl

Contras expires at midnight Mon-
day, and the rebels are said to be
rapidly running out of items like
food, clothing and medicine that
the new aid plans would provide.

Both versions of the new aid
package would keep non-lethal
supplies flowing to the rebels at
their positions inside Nicaraguan
territory. Neither would provide
new weapons. And both would
set up a $14 million program to
help war-injured children on all
sides of the conflict.

But while similar in what they
would do for the rebels in the

ans before

sh()rt term, the two versions set
starkly different ground rules for
an impending rematch between
the Reagan administration and
the Democratic Congress over
military aid for the rebels.

The Democratic version, which
House leaders say they are con-
fident will pass, holds out the
possibility that a new military aid
package could be considered
sometime after June 1.

But the conditions for such
consideration are strict: It could
happen only if the Democrat-
controlled House Intelligence
Committee certifies that the Con-
tras and the leftist Sandinista
government have not reached a
cease-fire and that it is the San-
dinistas' fault.

Then, the proposal would al—
low — but not require — the
party's leadership to bring forth
an aid proposal of its own design
and would allow amendment of
the package on the floor.

Panthers regain form
in win over Huskies,

return to

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

HARTFORD, Conn. —- It’s
been one month since the Pitt
Panther basketball team last
played in the friendly confines of
Fitzgerald Field House. One
month because Pitt played two
”home” games in the Civic Are-
na. Friendly because the Panthers
have not lost a game there all
season.

Actually, Pitt has not lost in the
Field House since Jan. 19, 1987,
when St. John's squeaked past the
Panthers 63-62.

That's 14 consecutive home
victories. Fourteen.

The road has not been so kind
to Pitt this year, however, as three
of Pitt's four losses cameat op-
posing arenas. Georgetown, Ok-
lahoma and Seton Hall have all
claimed victories over the Pan-
thers on their respective home
couns

The Panthers’ other loss came
at the hands of Syracuse in the
Civic Arena.

So it's no suprise that the Pan-
thers are eager to return to the
Oakland campus, particularly
with important late season games
against Boston College and Seton
Hall remaining.

The Eagles will be in town
tonight for an 8 p.m. matchup
with the Panthers at the Field
House.

The Panthers defeated BC
73-67 at Boston College earlier
this season.

”We haven't played in the
Field House since January [Jan.
25]," said freshman point guard
Sean Miller. ”The Big East is a
tough league. We've just been on
the road like crazy.”

Six of the Panthers’ last eight
games have been on the road,
and Pitt has struggled through the
last few, beating Providence
87-86 and losing 89-72 to Seton
Hall last Monday.

Part of the problem has been
the inconsistent play of junior for-
ward Jerome Lane. Lane, the na-
tion's leading rebounder last
year, had only 12 combined re-
bounds against Georgetown and

Field House

Seton Hall.

It seemed like the bottom was
dropping out on the Panthers. But
the Connecticut Huskies turned
out to be just what the doctor or-
dered for Pitt. .

The. Panthers, led by Lane's 22
points and 16 rebounds, held off
a late U Conn rally to defeat the
Huskies 74-69 at the Hartford
Civic Center on Saturday before
a crowd of 16,016.

The game attendance tied a
record for the largest crowd ever
to see a basketball game in the
six-state New England region.

Pitt's record improved to 20-4
overall and 10-3 in the Big East,
where the Panthers are in first
place, while Connecticut fell to
13-12 and 4-11, last in the con-
ference.

But there was more to it than
just Lane's resurgence. Charles
Smith sat out the last four minutes
of the first half and six minutes of
the second half with foul trouble
as U _Conn scratched its way from
a 40-28 halfime deficit to within
two points, 70-68, with only 1:39
left to play.

But Smith made up for his lack
of playing time by coming up
with what may have been the
biggest play of the game.

With 46 seconds remaining in
the game and Connecticut with
the ball, Husky forward Cliff
Robinson drove the lane for an
apparent layup that would have
tied the game at 70.

Smith had other ideas,
however. As Robinson went up,
Smith swatted the ball away and
Pitt chased it down.

The Panthers took the ball over
midcourt and passed it around,
running time off the clock. When
the ball reached Smith’s hands,
he tucked it under one arm,
taunting the U Conn players to
foul him. No one obliged the All-
American.

He passed off to Darelle Port-
er, who was immediately fouled
by U Conn’s Phil Gamble. Port-
er hit both ends of the ensuing
one-and-one to bring the score to
72-69. Connecticut could muster

Lane wakes up for Big East crunch time

HARTFORD, Conn. —- Intense.
One of the many words that
describes Jerome Lane on the
basketball court.

Opposing teams hate Lane be-
cause, no matter what they do, he
will always be there in the crucial
moments of the game to come up
with a big basket or a key
rebound.

But in recent games against
Georgetown and Seton Hall, the
6-foot-6 power forward seemed
almost non-existent, collecting
only 12 rebounds. Six rebounds
a game is about average for a for-
ward, hut lane is not your aver-
age forward.

Questions of a late-season

slump and lack of intensity were
thrown about after these games.
What answers were discovered?

They came Saturday in Hart-
ford in the form of digits, not
words: 22 points, 16 rebounds,
both team highs in Pitt's 74-69
victory over U Conn.

”My intensity level is much
better than it has been in previ-
ous games,” Lane said.

No question about it. Lane was
always right in he middle of the
action in the Hartford Civic
Center, taking his lumps while
collecting a rebound or going to
the hoop.

It paid off as Lane went to the

foul line 13 times, hitting 10

MATT
MARTIN

shots.

And of Lane's 16 boards, seven
of them were offensive, helping
Pitt to an 18-7 edge over U Conn
in second-chance points.

His defensive rebounding
helped lead to 13 fast-break
points.

’’I thought that Jerome Lane
may have played one of his bet-
ter games of the season,” Pitt
coach Paul Evans said.

Definitely. With Charles Smith

on the bench in the second half
with four fouls, Lane took over,
scoring 15 points and grabbing
six rebounds.

‘'1 just got key rebounds in key
situations,” Lane said.

Connecticut coach Jim Cal-
houn agreed. "Jerome is terrific
with the body.

”We always tell Lyman [DePri-
est, U Conn forward] if he wants
to put on 25 pounds and learn
how to push, he can become Jer-
ome Lane, too,” Calhoun said.

Not likely. There's only one Jer-
ome Lane. Although Lane has
been favorably compared to
former great Wes Unseld and the
round-mound-of-rebound,

Philadelphia 76er Charles Bark-
ley, Lane is in a class all by
himself.

Lane led the nation in rebound-
ing as a sophomore last year and
is currently third in the country
with an 11.9 rebounds-per-game
average.

And have you ever met anyone
else who has shattered a glass
backboard? Probably not.

Opposing teams certainly don't
take Lane's intensity for granted.
But if they concentrate too much
on Lane, Smith takes over as the
dominant inside player. It's a no-
win situation for Pitt’s compe-
tition.

Please see Jerome, page 8

erome——- Game

Continued from page 7

lane is in fifth place on the Pitt
all—time rebounding list with 882
boards. Sam Clancy tops the list
with 1,342 career board.s.

lane could surpass that record
and more if he decides to stay at
Pitt for his senior year.

But it's not an impossibility for
Lane to enter the NBA draft un-
der the hardship clause. Prior to
the Pitt-Georgetown game a
week ago, Lane said he would
stay at Pitt only if the Panthers do
not win a national championship
this year.

Again a no-win situation. If Pitt
brings the NCAA crown home,
lane leaves. if they lose in the
toiirrrarnerit, lane stays.

only one point after that, a foul
shot by Robinson. Smith al.so
connected on a one—and—one to
produce the final score as Steve
Pikiel|’s three-pointer at the bu/.-

”When Smith was in there, he

the game with 20 points and re-
bounds

Pitt still made its share of mis-

”We made some freshman
mistakes and just rushed
things,” Evans said. ”There's a
lack of experience in our

held Connecticut to 28 points in

Big

,_ Lady Panthers escape
East cellar with

victory over Wildcats

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

The Lady Panthers entered last
’Saturday’s game against Villano-
va with destiny in their own
hands. .

A win against the Lady Wild-
cats would assure Pitt of seventh
place in the Big East. More impor-
tantly, it would give the Lady
Panthers a bye in the preliminary
game of the Big East Tournament
this weekend.

Aided by an early run and
some tough defense at the end,
the Lady Panthers defeated the
the conference's second-ranked

-"7 Wildcats, 75-73, at Fitzgerald

Field House.

The win will pair the Panthers,
5-11 in the conference, 13-14
overall, against the same Wild-
cats, 11-5, 20-7, this Saturday
night.

"If they would have beaten us,
there is no way we would let
them beat us three games in a
row,” said women's head coach
Kirk Bruce. ’’If we won, that gives
us an edge ~ we can beat them.

"Vil|anova's the last team on
the list that uvc knew we could
beat. Even if we lost, that
would've been a positive sign
that we could play with them,”
Bruce added.

Sally Sheerer, playing her last

,3 regular-season game for Pitt,

blocked a Diane Decker shot
with :03 remaining to seal the
win. Sheerer was second in scor-
ing for the Lady Panthers, pour-
ing in 13 points and pulling
down five rebounds.

Forward Lorri Johnson led the
Panthers with 14 points and six
rebounds. Tabatha Long scored
12 points while forward Deidra
Baker and guard Jennifer Shingler
chipped in with 11 and 10 points,
respectively.

Villanova’s Lisa Angelotti, a
preseason All-Big East second
team selection, led all scorers
with 29 points and nine re-
bounds. Decker was the only
other Wildcat in double figures
with 12.

In the first half, the Lady Pan-
thers raced out to an early 7-0
lead, but soon increased it to 16,
26-10, with 9:33 left. The Wild-
cats trimmed the lead for the re-
mainder of the half as they
outscored the Lady Panthers,
24-9.

The Panthers led at halftime,
35-34.

Wildcat forward Teresa Pasik
scored the first basket in the se-
cond half, giving Villanova its
only lead of the game.

The Lady Panthers quickly
regained the lead and even led by
eight, 62-54 and 69-61, the latter
with 5:08 remaining in the game.
The Wildcats rebounded, scoring
the next eight points, but the Lady
Panthers’ defense shut them
down, allowing only two points

 

in the final 2:26, to preserve the
victory.

The prospect of not only beat-
ing the Wildcats, but hosting the
tournament at the Field House,
has Bruce in a good disposition.

”We’re pretty tough here. It's
going to help us not having to
play Thursday,” said Bruce refer-
ring to the Seton Hall-
Georgetown prelim game, with
the winner receiving the eighth-
place spot. ”We can Just sit back
and watch.

”The winner of the tournament
in two of the last three years has
been the home team. Some
teams have a six-hour bus ride.
[Each team] can only have the
court for an hour, so we'll just go
over to Trees [Hall]/’ added
Bruce.

As for the win, Bruce attribut-
ed it to the whole team, not Just
any one player.

’’I could talk about Deidra all
day, but everyone on the team
helped out. Jennifer Shingler
made some clutch baskets, Sally's
defense, Lorri in the last four to
five minutes of the game,
Denise's [Becher] free throws ——
big free throws.

”Everybody helped out — even
the bench was awesome," added
Bruce.

LADY PANTHER NOTES:
Senior Leann Burkholder, along
with Sheerer, were honored dur-
ing pregame ceremonies  Pitt's
1 3 regular—season wins were the
most under Bruce in his first three
years. Bruce's record as head
coach of the Lady Panthers is
31-51  The Big East tournament
begins Thursday with the prelimi-
nary game at 7:30 p.m. There are
four games scheduled for Friday,
Pitt and Villanova being the last
game of the evening, set for 8
pm.

Lady gymnasts hold their ground
at the Ohio State Invitational

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

The women's gymnastics team
traveled to Ohio Saturday where
they competed in a quad—meet.

The host team, Ohio State
University, won the meet with a
183.6 total. The University of
Minnesota placed second with a
score of 179.6. Pitt closely fol-
lowed Minnesota, placing third
with a 179.45. Bowling Green
finished fourth with a 176.45.

Competing for the Lady Pan-
thers were seniors Kim Calder-
one, Cathy Coleman and Leann
Vaughn; juniors Trish Aser and
Stephanie Megill; sophomores
Hope Celani and Shelly Sleith;
and freshmen Robyn Borchers,
Jeannie Vecchio and Kathy
Wallish.

On their first event, the floor
exercise, the Panthers had some
trouble due to lack of endurance.

Celani was first up and per-
formed a good routine scoring

8.55. Calderone, Sleith and
Borchers had some problems at
the end ()f their routines, but Aser
and Wallish managed to pick the
scores up, receiving a 8.9 and
9.1, respectively.

Despite difficulties on floor, the
Panthers came back strong on
their next three events.

On vault, the gymnasts attained
their highest vault total for a sec-
ond time this season with a
45.95. Sleith and Coleman set the
pace for Pitt, both receiving a 9.0.
Wallish followed with a 9.05.
Aser hit for a 9.1, while co-
captain Vaughn scored 9.3.

Calderone hit an excellent
vault, placing third in the event
with a 9.5. (her highest vault
score of the season).

On the unevens, Sleith started
off with a great routine, scoring
a 9.1. Calderone scored 8.65
with a fairly watered down rou-
tine. Megill turned in a good per-
formance, scoring 8.25, despite a
fall in her routine.

Borchers hit for a 9.05. Vec-
chio, who also had a great rou-
tine, scored 9.15, which tied her
for second place with OSU’s Patti
Black.

On the balance beam, Pitt
almost broke the school's record
beam total. Wallish and Calder-
one each had one fall, but still
scored well with 8.6 (Wallish)
and 8.75 (Calderone). Sleith per-
formed a solid routine for 8.85,
while Borchers also hit a great
routine for 9.1.

Both Vecchio and Aser scored
season highs on their beam rou-
tines. Vecchio scored 9.3, plac-
ing fourth and Aser placed third
with 9.4.

As for the rest of the meet, ”ex-
cept for the slow start on floor,
we did really well,” said Coach
Debbie Yohman. ”Even with
their disappointing floor scores
they managed to do great on their
next three events, which is very
important.”

Sleith had another great all-

around score with a 35.65 and is
proving to be a strong, consistent

ing, if the starting pitchers can
live up to their potential, if the
lineup can gel into one smooth
unit, and if the Mets catch the in-
jury bug, the Phillies may be able
to overtake the New Yorkers.

The St. Louis Cardinals didn't
have the pitching or the power
last year to win the division, but
they did. During the off season
they let Jack Clark's 35 home
runs dance away to the Yankees
and signed big Bob Horner.

It took Clark at least one season
to adjust to Busch Stadium. It will
take Horner at least that long if
not longer. Homer can't run,
can't hit anything but homers,
and strikes out a lot. Homer is not
the answer.

The Cards’ pitching is solid.
John Tudor, Joe Magrane, Danny
Cox and the aging Bob Forsch
can pitch at or above .500. Todd
Worrell will have to save about
50 games to keep the Cardinals
in the race. It is shaping up to be
a long season for St. Louis fans.

Last season, the Montreal Ex-
pos surprised everybody with a
third-place finish.

They did nothing to improve
their team this season. Just about
everybody else in the division
did. The Expos have to rely on an
outcast pitching staff of Pascual
Perez, Dennis Martinez and

Tim Wallach may be one of the
best third basemen in the busi-
ness, and Tim Raines is the best
all—around player in the National
League, but after that, there is
nothing. Hubie Brooks has been
moved from shortstop to right-
field, but injuries seem to be his
downfall.

With an out-classed pitching
staff and an unknown offense, the
Expos look more like Cinderella's
sister this season.

Coming into this season, the
Pittsburgh Pirates needed a pow-
er hitter and a quality left—handed

starting pitcher. They picked up
neither.

Centerfielder Andy Van Slyke,
catcher Mike LaValliere, and
third-baseman Bobby Bonilla all
had career years, as did the
whole pitching staff. Sid Coffee-
and-Bream has been a disap-
pointment at first base.

Can everybody on the team do

As if the Chicago Cubs didn't
have enough problems, Andre
Dawson now says that he will en-
tertain other offers if an arbitrator
declares him a free agent again.

The Cubs finished at the bot-

the best starting pitcher in the Na-

wisdom, forced General Manager
Dallas Green out of office, named

'Bedrock’ appreciates
lack of interest after
tough regular season

CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) ——
After Steve Bedrosian won the
Cy Young Award, he figured
opportunity would come
knocking.

Well, he did get a call from
the town dogcatcher of
Lawrence, Mass.

”She wanted me to do a
spot about spaying and neuter-
ing pets. That's not exactly
what I had in mind when they
told me you'd get a lot of en-
dorsements,” the hard-
throwing Philadelphia Phillies
right-hander said.

Other than that, the best
offers Bedrosian has had were
a couple of banquets and a
spot on the Phillies’ promo-
tional caravan.

No matter. He had said back
in November when he won
the award in a nail—biter over
the Chicago Cubs’ Rick Sut-
cliffe that he wanted to put the
whole thing behind him
anyway.

”None of the Cy Young bus-
iness has gone to my head,”
Bedrosian said. ’’It wasn't real-
ly what I expected anyway. I
thought I'd be making en-
dorsements and be attending
a lot of banquets, but it didn't
happen like that, and it may be
a blessing in disguise.

’’I received the Cy Young
Award in Boston at a media
dinner, and that was super be-
cause that's home for me. My
family and friends could enjoy
it with me. And I went to the
writers’ dinner in Philly. That
was it. Real quiet. No Zest
commercials. No milk en-
dorsements. Nothing."

Bedrosian last year became
the third player in National
League history to notch 40
saves, and he set a major-
league record by earning saves
in 13 straight appearances.
The Phillies won 50 of 65
games in which he appeared,
and he posted a 2.01 ERA -
after a shaky start that includ-
ed a 12.28 ERA through his
first six appearances.

In 1986, his first season with
the Phillies, Bedrosian was 2-3
with a 4.55 ERA in his first 27

games but rallied to go 6-2
with a 2.76 ERA afterjune 24,
finishing with 29 saves.

’’I don't know why that's
happened,” Bedrosian said of
his early problems. ”I felt the
velocity was there when we
left camp, but I guess my ball
just didn't have its
movement.”

The Phillies plan to keep an
eye on how much they use
Bedrosian this year. Last year,
they used him in more than
half of their games, and 24 of
his appearances were for at
least two innings.

He had some problems afte.
his first inning in July games,
and by mid—August, he had to
miss a stretch because of ten-
donitis in his shoulder.

"We have to recognize that
we can beat him to death,"
Manager Lee Elia said. ”It's so
tempting to put him in the
game when he's on a roll, but
these guys can't pitch every
day. Sometimes you just have
to bite the bullet.”

Bedrosian expects to talk
with Elia before the season be-
gins about how he will be
used.

’’I think we're going to have
a lot of communication,"
Bedrosian said. "Lee knows
me better now. And I've got to
know when to tell him I can't
pitch, when to not even pick
up a baseball for a day."

Pirates out to prove they can
compete with best in the league

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — The
New York Mets have become the
team the Pittsburgh Pirates love
to hate.

Maybe that's why several
Pirates, such as former New York
Yankees pitcher Brian Fisher, are
wearing T-shirts that read ’’I
[don't love] the New York Mets."

The Pirates know they won't
earn the respect of teams such as
the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals
until they can compete with them
on a seasonal, not just a game-by-
game basis. But some Pirates
think the Mets have treated them
as rank inferiors for far too long.

”There are a couple of guys on
that team that keep rubbing your
nose in it that you've been in last
place  you're not as good a
team as they are," Fisher said. ’’It
gets irritating all the time, and a
rivalry has built up from that.

”Their attitude was, ’We're the

Mets, but you're the Pirates. You

ll!

guys aren't even close.
The rivalry was nothing but a
rout in 1986, when the Mets won
17 of 18 from the Pirates and
wound up world champions. But
the Pirates helped cost the Mets
a chance to repeat last year when
they won three of their last six
against them in September. The
Mets won the season series 12-6.
One of the victories was an 8-2
win over Mets’ ace Dwight Goo-
den on Sept. 26, after Gooden
had accused the Pirates of acting
like "a little league team."
”Maybe at every position, we
don't match up with them, but
we try to go about our job profes-

sionally, and we don't talk bad
about other teams," Fisher said.
”We don't get in the paper and
say ‘We're No. 1’ or guarantee
wins.

”We don't need the news-
papers to do our talking. We try
to talk on the field.  When you
use the media to put other teams
down, I think that shows a lack
of common sense. It's just bad.
But the rivalry, I think it's great."

Notes from the Pirates’ spring
training camp:

0 Pitchers Doug Drabek and
John Smiley signed one—year con-
tracts Wednesday, leaving nine
Pirates unsigned, including out-
fielder Barry Bonds and pitchers
Mike Dunne and Brian Fisher.

Drabek, a right-hander, reco-
vered from a 2-11 start last sea-
son to finish 11-12 with a 3.88
ERA and one shutout in 29
games, 28 of them starts. The left-
handed Smiley was 5-6 with a
5.76 ERA and four saves in 63

games during his first major
league season.

0 Center fielder Andy Van
Slyke was the subject of playful
kidding Wednesday when he ar-
rived in (‘amp with a closely
cropped, nearly Marine-like
hairdo.

0 Pitcher Mike Dunne, an avid
baseball card collector since
1972, was in a Bradenton con-
venience store recently when he
spotted a box of newly issued
1988 cards. He bought a 10-card
pack, and inside, he found  a
Mike Dunne card.

’'It was weird. I opened it up,
and there I was," Dunne said.
”But I'd still rather open up a Dar-
ryl Strawberry or an Eric Davis.
That's what it's all about. They're
just more exciting than I."

Dunne was The Sporting
News’ National League rookie
pitcher of the year last season, go-
ing 13-6 with a 3.03 ERA that was
the second-lowest in the league.
