Pitt junior Ray St. Marie reads a letter on one of the 1,100 backpacks displayed in the Assembly Room in the William Pitt Union yesterday. The
bags were part of the Send Silence Packing exhibit to raise awareness about depression and suicide.

Crowded in a spiral pattern in the as-
sembly room ofthe William Pitt Union
yesterday were 1,100 backpacks. A
few were colorful — such as a “Blue’s
Clues” bag and a Barbie lunch pack
— whereas others had personal mes-
sages. And some weren’tbackpacks at
all, but satchels or briefcases.

Obama announces 2012 bid

President Barack Obama kicked off his re—election campaign yesterday '"

. Michael Macagnone
News Editor

President Barack Obama an-
nounced yesterday in an e-mail
and a campaign video that he will
seek a second term as president
of the United States.

In the video, Obama support-
ers emphasized the need for a
grassroots campaign driven by
volunteers, and it seems likely
that the campaign will reach out

to Pitt students.

The announcement came over
the campaign’s website without
an accompanying statement by
the president — whose schedule
yesterday included no public ap-
pearances. Obama did not speak
in the video, though pictures of
him appear several times during
the two—minute production.

On the Obama campaign’s
website, barackobama.com, a

video and blog posts push for A

people to volunteer and contrib-

ute to the campaign. So far, no
nationally known Republicans
have officially declared presiden-
tial candidacy. I

In the 2008 election cycle —
during which Pennsylvania was
considered a battleground state

multiple ofﬁces in Pittsburgh,
including one in Oakland that
brought in dozens of Pittstudent

Judge talks troubles, trials in international law

Amy Friedenberger

Pitt law students learned quickly
that international law has plenty of
gray areas — enough that many of

questions as: Who exactly can be

For that question, Mose had

As evidence, he told a story
about a woman put on trial in
Rwanda, who said that she had
never done anything wrong in
her life. But one day she went to
a mosque and killed a woman be-
cause she said, “I felt it was my
day to kill.”

Mose used that story and oth-
ers to emphasize his point that
many questions in international
law have no easy answers.

“They were normal people,
perfectly likable people in normal
situations, but it comes down to
how people react in different situ—.
ations,” Mose said.

Among these gray areas, Mose
thought at least one thing was
clear: By putting war criminals
into a courtroom, tribunals can
“[send] the signal that impunity
is not tolerated,” he said. ,

For example, tribunals in
Rwanda sought justice for the es-
timated 800,000 victims of the
genocide in the central African
country.

ing center.

Suicide is consistently ranked
among the top three causes of death
forcollege students, who have ahigher
rate of psychological illnesses than
older adults. At least three Pitt stu-
dents have committed suicide in the
past three years.

“[The bags] allow the students to
connect to it. Most students are carry-
ingabackpack,” said BrandonDoman,
part ofActive Minds road staff, adding
thatthe organization has resources for
people of all ages.

Nicole Pietrzak — another Active

 road staffer — said that while

on tour, she and Doman encountered
many people who were unaware of
their mental health resources or sim-
ply unaware of the difliculties people
face. She said that some say “thank
you,” and others say things such as “I
could have been a backpack,” or “I’ve
known someonewho could have been
abackpac ” 1
“Active minds’ big thing is that
they’re changing the conversation
about mental health  and erasingthe

stigmathatit’s not OKtotalkabout [it],
because you should,” Piettzak said. '

Wandering around the exhibit, Pitt
students and faculty dipped down to
read the families’ and friends’ notes
about their loved ones who committed
suicide. Pitt freshman Steven Turetsky,
who was visiting the exhibit, also be-
lieves talking is important.

“There’s a silence about it. It’s im-
portant to start a conversation,” said
'I‘uretsky, who losthisfatherto suicide.
“EX/en if you aren’t affected by it —— ev-
eryone knows someone [who is] .”

Signs displayed around the room
included statistics, facts and feelings

from the perspective of people with

mental illnesses. Writteninstark black
against white paper, some delivered
ﬁmﬂs: I

“There’s 1 suicide every minute.”

In addition to hopeful messages:

conduct, the University“prohibits and
will not engage in discrimination or
harassment on the basis of race, col-
or, religion, national origin, ancestry,
sex, age, marital status, familial status,
sexual orientation, disability or status
as a disabled veteran or veteran of the
Vietnam era.”

Schools across the country have
similar policies. Still, Duncan and Ali
said that a number of misconceptions
exist among colleges and universities
when it comes to Title IX legislation.

“For instance, there is a miscon-
ception out there that a school has to
wait until a criminal investigation is

completed before they can launch an ‘

investigation of their own,” Duncan
said. “That’s simply not the case.”
Some ofthe guidelines address the

complicated nature ofsome sexual as— ~

sault cases, such as those in which a
student or his or her parent does not
want to ﬁle a complaint with police or
does not request that the_school take
any action on the student’s behalf.
Under Title IX, if a school knows
or reasonably should know about
possible sexual harassment or sexual
violence, it must promptly investigate
to determine what occurred and take

when you check in at the

tion, even if a student does notwantto
press charges.

The guidelines also stress that a
criminal investigation into allegations
ofsexual harassmentorsexualviolence
does not relieve the school of its duty
under Title IX to resolve complaints
promptly and equitably.

“Schools are ofteninthe bestposi-
tion to prevent sexual violence and to
respond to it promptly and effectively
if it occurs,”Ali said. “These guidelines
offer another tool in the ﬁght against
the harmful effects of sexual violence
by providing technical assistance and
seeking remedies designed to stop such

conduct, prevent its recurrence and

remediate its irnpa ”

The guidelines’ release comes about 1
a week after the federal government

launched a highly publicized investi-
gation into incidents on.Yale Univer-

sity’s campus. The incidents - which

according to the Yale Daily News in-
volveda“naked party’ ’thatwashosted
by a campus social group and several
allegations of discriminatory behav-
ior by campus ﬁaternities — raised
questions about the obligations faced
by schools dealing with complaints of
sexual abuse.

Under Title IX of the Civil Rights

Act of 1964, colleges and universities
are prohibited from engaging in dis-
crimination on the basis ofsex in any
federally funded education program
or activity. Schools arealso requiredto
respond “promptly and eﬁ'ectively”to
allegations of sexual assault.

Duncan and Ali both said the new
guidelines — which will be sent to all
high schools, colleges and universities

that receive federal funding — were

not drafted in response to incidents at

. Yale or any other speciﬁc institutions.

Rather, they pointed to a number of
statistics released in the past few years
by the National Institute ofjustice and
other sources as the basis for the new
guidelines. ‘I

Duncan speciﬁcally mentioned a
2007 National Institute ofjustice study
that found that as many as one in ﬁve
women is the victim of complete or at-
tempted sexual assaultbythe time they
graduate college. The reportalso found
that 6.1 percent of men are Victims of
completed or attempted sexual assault
during college. '

The National Institute ofjustice is
a federally ﬁmded organization that
seekstoilluminate social andcivilrights
issues using science, according to its
website.

professor at the law school, said that Mose
played a critical role in the tribunal in
Rwanda.

“I’m sure we all remembered how a small
and landlocked country experienced one
of the largest human tragedies of the 20th
century,” Jalloh said.

The tribunals in Rwanda established
during the 1990s were part of a growing
movement in international law to try war
criminals and involved the formation the
International Criminal Court, Mose said.
The court was the ﬁrst treaty—based inter-
national organization designed to prosecute
people for violent crimes that caught the
international community’s attention, ac-
cording to its website.

This ﬁrst ad hoc tribunal was established
in 1993 to address war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia.

Of the seven tribunals that were later
established in other countries, only three
currently remain. '

Mose said that the future of charging war
criminals remains with the ICC.

He said that the ICC must manage the
decision to have the trial in the country
where the conﬂict occurred or in The Hague
—- the ICC’s main court stationed in the
Netherlands.. ’ ’

Felix Yerace, president of the Global

EDITORIAL

Will we believe in
‘change’ again?

he energy on campus
N was undeniable —— like a
Super Bowl victory.

When Barack Obama ran for his
ﬁrst presidential bid, Pitt students
voted in record numbers and some
waited two hours to cast their bal-
lots on campus. And when he won,
students stormed Forbes Avenue,
blocking traﬁic and screaming “O-

» BAM-A, O-BAM-A.”

About 75 percent of people
who voted in Soldiers 8: Sailors
and Posvar Hall, the main polling
locations for Pitt students, favored
the Democratic candidate over his
main Republican opponent, Rep.

John McCain.

Obama organized a grassroots
campaign like none the nation
had ever seen. He tapped into
the student psyche —— running
on a message of “change we can
believe in.”

Students clearly drank the
Kool—Aid.

But will we drink it again?

Do we still believe in
“change”?

Will young voters turn out for
him again in 2012, when he’ll deﬁ-
nitely run for re-election?

If the rest of our readers
think as we do, they’d agree that
the president has a huge task in
front of him. He built his 2008
campaign on his ability to connect
to voters, to visit people in their
small towns and on their college
campuses. He marketed himself
as a unique candidate who would
bring a fresh voice to the Wash-
ington establishment in a time
when the economy and the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan were the
dominant issues. He also brought
the health care debate to the fore-
front.

But when Obama became
president he, by deﬁnition, be-
came the establishment. So his
old campaign tactics will no longer
work.

If Obama wants to be re-elect-
ed, he’ll likely have to capture
the key youth vote — in 2008 he
received 66 percent of the 18 to
29-year-old vote whereas McCain
received 32 percent of it, and the
other age groups were decided by
remarkably smaller margins, ac-

cording to CNN.

So far, we’re not impressed with
what we’ve seen from Obama. The
president announced his candi-
dacy _in a strange video posted on

1» his campaign site yesterday. Once

touted as a man who would make
Washington more transparent, he
didn’t even appear in the video
except for a single photograph of
him giving a speech. V

So to Obama, we’d like to offer
some advice. We hope he’ll ditch
the celebrity visits to campus and
the ﬂashy poster signs and focus
on the part of politics that really
matter —— the policies.

As students currently pursuing
an education, we feel a special tie
to labor unions, speciﬁcally the
ones that advocate for students,
such as the teachers’ unions in
Wisconsin or the AFL-CIO, whose
chairman recently supported stu-
dents here at Pitt. We’re hoping
Obama, and any other candidates
vying for our vote, will support
these issues as well.

Next, and perhaps most impor-
tant in our minds, are the inter-
locking issues of health careiand
unemployment.

We give the president credit
for working with other legislators
to help the unemployment rate
drop to the lowest it’s been in two
years, but 8.8 percent is unaccept-
ably high. What’s more troubling
was‘ an article in The New York
Times a little over a week ago that
reported that the unemployment

rate is even higher among college ,

graduates under the age of 25, at
11.2 percent. A

With fears of unemployment
come fears about health coverage.
We’d be lying if we told you that
we didn’t ﬁnd comfort in the idea
that Obama’s health care propos-
als allow us to stay on our parents’
health insurance until we’re 26.
Because the latest Rasmussen poll
told us that 58 percent of people
favor repeal of that reform, We’re
looking for someone to advocate
for us. '

So here you are Mr. Presi-
dent.

Address these issues, and you
might convince us there’s more
than just a hope for change. i

TUESDAYS WITH MOLLY

Where there’s debt, there’s a Crazy idea

Molly Green
Columnist

  
 

The Republican National Com-
mittee is desperate — desperate
for money. . ,

,_ And now the RNC — currently
$21 million in debt, according to
The New York Times -—- is con-
cocting various schemes to get
cash quickly.

The latest is a proposal to GOP
primary presidential contenders:
The RNC will graciously host the
upcoming primary debates —
picking the format, content and
moderator—— if the candidates will
help bail the party out of debt. ,

I suppose this is beneﬁcial to

Republican candidates, because '

otherwise the debates would be
hosted by the “lamestream” me-
dia, and who knows what kind of
catastrophic repercussions could
come from that? .

So far, candidates have yet to
respond to the proposal, and I’m
not sure how well it will go over.
At best, the candidate is con-
tributing to his own campaign.
At worst, he’s contributing to the
campaign of his opponent.

But what else is RNC Chair-
man Reince Priebus to do‘? It turns
out that being the leader of an
organization with significant
amounts of debt is not an easy
job. Go ﬁgure.

I can just picture Priebus pac-
ing around some gothic-style lair
and muttering to himself as the
scorned specter of former Chair-
man Michael Steele ﬂoats around
him fo rlornly.

Of course, as an alternative,

and chocolate cake with rhubarb
compote”?

Here’s a great idea. What if
Priebus harvested the leather
from John Boehner’s face to
launch a designer handbag line?
These bags, made with only the
ﬁnest Ohioan leather, are perfect
for the conservative on the go and

even include a built-in handgun 7

holster, ranging in sizes from
.30 caliber to magnum hand
cannon.

I can just picture Priebus
paein around some ethic-

the RNC could just model itself
afterthe Democratic National
Committee. According to the
New York Daily News, the DNC
cashed in $1.5 million at a fund-

But wait,‘ there’s more! For just
an extra $100, they could receive
a bonus signed remix edition in
which Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va.,
raps the Bill of Rights. .

‘ Alternatively, the RNC could
look to national politics as a mod-
el. The Republicans’ solution to
our national debt is to cut fund-
ing.

According to the Wall Street
Journal, this week Republicans

will present “a 2012 budget pro-
posal that would cut more than
$4 trillion from federal spending
projected over the next decade.”
So the RNC could just cut
something like two—thirds of its
spending and get rid of all of
those unnecessary bureaucratic
positions and the millions spent
gratifying its every desire.
According to CBS, both na-

tional parties spend two—thirds

of their money “on the care and
comfort of committee staffs and
on efforts to raise more funds,
with lavish spending on limou-
sines, expensive hotels, meals
and tips.”

Now I know that limousines

and Thai spa treatments are way
more important than Medicare —— .

so these cuts won’t be easy — but
hopefully the RNC will ﬁnd a way

the American people.

_ As for my last idea, I admit is a
little out there. It’s kind of crazy.
But maybe if GOP congressmen
created some of these jobs they’ve
been promising, their thankful
constituents might donate to the
Party-

mittee’s “Heat Map” —- a fun little

Texas —— at least when it comes to
handing money over to politicians
who fail to deliver on pretty much

. l5eople don’tiTalways immediately

take well to Grace Ginn’s photogra-

. phy —— the pieces feature images of

the body so close that sometimes
it’s difficult to discern what body
part is being shown.

“I’ve accepted that in order to
make a piece successful for your-
self, not everyone’ will be happy
with it,” said Ginn, a senior major-
ing in studio arts. “Some people
may ﬁnd my work disturbing or
hate it, but even that negative feed-
back is needed.”

Ginn —— along with 25 other
students —— has an opportunity
to show her artwork at the 2011
Studio Arts Student Exhibition, an
annual presentation of students’
work hosted in the Frick Fine Arts
building.

Each year, studio faculty select
artwork that is best suited for dis-
play from submissions made by se-
nior students. The faculty may also

select artwork from their classes
regardless of the level or major of
their students. This year’s exhibit

features 94 total pieces and takes '

up four rooms in the gallery.
“The exhibition is an oppor-
tunity for the students to present
their work publicly and to defend
it through gallery talks, which is
ultimately participating in the pro-
fession of what we do as artists.
Work sitting in the studio has no
resonance until it is shared,” Dela-
nie Jenkins, chairwoman and as-
sociate professor of the studio arts
department, said in an e—mail.
Ginn’s photography sits on a
sidewall in the exhibit and catches
the eye’s attention because of its
nature and topic. Ginn loves pho-
tographing the human body and
thinks of photos as “recordings of
sculptures I’m creating with mod-
els,” in that she might manipulate
the body by squeezing a particular
part of skin or taking a close pic-
ture of two body parts together.
Ginn doesn’t necessarily view
the negative responses of her pho-
tography as a bad thing.. .
“I think that’s what art, in a
way, tries to do,” Ginn said. “It

I tries to get people thinking, get

people to react, get them to think

Sourdough bread starter not man- eating monster

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

IfI am afraid ofcertain things that
sometimes appear in my kitchen —
such as the chocolate-chip-covered
Oreo cookies —Ilive inoutrightternor
of the sourdough starter on top of my
reﬁ-igerator.

Like the Stay Puft marshmallow
man from Ghost Busters, I am fairly
conﬁdent it will rise up and suffocate
my entire apartment complex in a
gooey mess. I have been repeatedly
assured thatthis isachildishbelief, but
I’m holding my ground. Nevertheless,

we might as well investigate it.

That bread requires yeast is fairly
common knowledge, but the fact that
some types of bread require live wild
yeastis less well-known. Ratherthana
simple packet ofyeastfromthe grocery
store, preparing sourdough requires
incorporatingaportion of dough from
the last batch of sourdough called a

starter —- meaning that baking sour-
dough for the ﬁrst time requires some
sort of manipulation of the space-time
continuum. How is one supposed to
obtain the original starter in the ﬁrst
place?

It’s possible to create one by blend-
ing a cup of warm water with a cup of

ﬂourand keeping itinawarm place (70
to 80 degrees Fahrenheit). That sounds
easyuntilthe partwhere ithastobefed
every 24 hours for days at a time with
ﬂour and water until the mixture devel-
ops bubbles and a beer-like smell. It’s
far more preferable to obtain a starter
from someone else.

In the course of my research, We

frequently found starter referred to ’

as a “pet,” — a comparison that I, at
least, am thoroughly uncomfortable
with -— but which is, nevertheless,
fairly accurate. It must be fed ﬂour
and water, provided with a home in

Following a seven-inch vinyl of the a

song “Lower Away,” ‘which was released
in December, the newest set provides
alternative styles. Whereas the original
“Lower -Away” has an instrumental and

E , vocal balance, thenewest songs choose to
showcase either musical embellishments

or simple accompaniment. The combina-

tion of plugged—in and unplugged leaves

something to be desired.
i In the electric songs, the lead singer has
a whiney tone to his voice, though he’s per-
fectly tolerable in the acoustic versions.
That same kind of mismatch makes for an
album that’s not very cohesive. ‘
Included in the five-track release are

-5 After this exhibit, Ginn will ﬁnish up
her classes at Pitt before going to graduate
school at Moo_re College of Art and Design
in Philadelphia. for design.

Aside from explaining and defending
their work, exhibiting pieces in this setting
glso gives students opportunity to show
their art to collectors..

“Collectors have purchased works from
exhibitions, and really seeing the work on
the walls, in the elegance of the space, the
work reaching a public — is quite a thrill,”
department chairwomanjenkins said. “The
show reaches beyond campus and can help
their career, and for some who won’t nec-
essarily pursue art, it is still a signiﬁcant

accomplishment and marker. Thisexhibi-..

tion is as signiﬁcant as graduation for many
students.”

,3_ Another senior considering a career
in art is Benjy Blanco. The studio arts and
English literature major has three pieces
on display in the exhibit — a sculpture of
a bushmaster snake in shattered wood, a
video exploring Latino culture and a series
of etchings mapping out iconic mythologi-
cal events.

“Ultimately, the reason why I pursue art
is surprisingly mechanical — here is where
my talents lie,” Blanco said in an e—mail.

through a hobby. As a child, he created his
own toys, and he never gave up on the skill
through high school and college. As a result,
he continues to enjoy hand-on creations.

“I don’t necessarily see my future in the
high—art, gallery—crawl scene — but as long
as I’m making physical things, be it a trade
or some form of teaching, I know I’ll be
fulﬁlled because it’s the best expression of
my natural skills,” Blanco said. ‘

He plans to take a year off after complet-
ing college before attending graduate school
to obtain education certiﬁcates.

One of the things in this show that he
ﬁnds to be a change from the usual class
routine is the feedback from the judges.
Jenkins said that a panel of three to four

judges-from the studioarts department offer »

critiques and advice during the exhibition
process. S '

“This is a capstone experience,”Jenkins
said, explaining that some students have
been in exhibits before while others have
not, and that the exhibition is a highlight of
the hard work students do as artists.

The critique—and—discussion process
takes students out of the comfort of the
classroom, Blanco said.

own — it’s a little frightening but exhila-
rating to start engaging in this next step,”
he said. I P

an unplugged version and one remixed
by Chloroform Days. “Lower Away (un-
plugged)” highlights -a classic piano
melody, which ﬁts well with Corey Judge‘

» crooning lyrics like, ”Could. we have been

friends if things hadn’t turned so bad in
the end?” Although melancholy, the com-
bination is complementary and the piano
brings out the ballad-esque charm. An-
other acoustic song, “Faux Real,” has a
similar effect as the tune soothes while
the lyrics lament. ,

Chloroform’s remix of “Lower Away”
bears a much different result. It seems
that the singer has been lamenting over
afailed relationship. The song resembles
an acid trip as psychedelic sounds intro—
duce a woman’s voice presenting names
of colors in Spanish followed by an echo
of “lower away” leading the listener to
a pleasant piano tune. Distorted pedals

and soft percussion provide even more I

vision-inducing elements.

The two almost—live songs on the
list, “Little Bridges” and “Cassini,” offer
sounds that are reminiscent of summer.
The optimistic melody and playful voice
in “Little Bridges” sounds like the sound-

track to a day on the beach. The lyrics, “If y if

not now then when?” seem urgent but still,
the music is very calm and laid back.

_ “Cassini,” although comparablylaid
back in terms of voice and the bass beat,
introduces various layers that require
more focus to avoid getting lost in the

‘noise fuzz. A whipping sound whirls

around softly sung lyrics like, -“Come with

whisper to a hoarse scream at a moment’s
notice. He isn’t perfect, though, as he fails

_ to enunciate, and the words get lost in the

music half the time.

Luckily, his music makes up for the
ﬂaws in his lyrics.

Some of the music comes in a fast and
furious pace, demanding that people rock

» out while listening and barely giving lis-

teners time to keep up.
Other songslike “Meet Me On The Oth-
er Side” are heavily instrumental, with

the repeated lyric “Meet me on the other‘
side” humming along synthesized guitars
and keyboards. _

Songs like .“The Silence,” which change
the tune of the songs from hardcore to
almost mellow compared to the opening
tracks, become more like classic rock with
some impressive guitar chords and har-
monizing vocals. .

If anything, this album is worth it for
some pretty cool instrumentals. This is
some dark rock with kick to it.

Pitt takes two ofthree f

—Panthers rally for win on Friday, win in extra innings on Saturday before blowing late lead Sunday ,

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

It was far from easy for the Pitt
men’s baseball team this weekend
against the Notre Dame Fighting
Irish. “ .
But after a four-run comeback
on Friday and an extra-inning
"walk-off win on Saturday, the
Panthers found a way to pull out
two exciting games in the first
Big East weekend series at the
new Petersen Sports Complex on
upper campus.

Pitt 6, Notre Dame 5

It didn’t look good early for
Pitt in Friday’s game.

Notre Dame (11-14-1, 3-3 Big
East) jumped out to an early 3-0
lead and, heading into the Pan-

Ther’s half of the eighth inning,
the Irish had made it 5-1.

But Pitt (15-10, 3-3 Big East)
came roaring back. The Panthers
used four consecutive singles fol-
lowed by an error to cut the lead
to 5-3 and loaded the bases for
senior outﬁelder Zach Duggan.

Duggan responded with a
single of his own that drove in
two runs and tied the game. Then

the Irishfs attempt at a comeback.

Pat Skerry has accepted a head
coaching job at Towson Univer-
sity in Maryland, a Pitt official
“conﬁrmed Monday.

Known as an inﬂuential re-

cruiter, the 41 year-old Skerry

' had been an assistant at schools .

such as Providence College and
Rhode Island before joining the
Pitt staff this past summer.

The Medford, Mass., native
has head coaching experience
at Curry College, and his 6.8 ca-
reer assists-per-game mark while
playing at Tufts College still ranks
10th all—time in the nation.

A news conference at Towson
is scheduled for Tuesday to for-

- mal1y.a.nnourtce his .hirin.g.l . . _

Then Pitt doubled its lead in the _

very next inning when Koniec-
zny scored off of a Casey Roche
double.

But this time, itwas Notre

Dame that fought back. It scored

one in the eighth and took advan- .

tage of a Pitt error in the ninth to

tie the game, sending it into extra

innings with the score at 2-2.

Somelof the Panthers recorded

strong times at the relays, which they 1

ran in 40-some degree weather.

Headlining the Pitt’s top runners
was Dontave Cowsette, who had his
best time of the outdoor season so far
when he hit 1:50.48 in the 800-me-
ter run, which was good enough for
third place. As a team, the men ﬁn-

His performance -— which Cow-

him toward building the conﬁdence
needed for a Big East Championship

“It’s more mental for me,” said
Cowsette, a junior. “I’m still 
very hard, but I’m approaching my
races more relaxed. I’m just trusting
my coaches and my abilities.”

TONY’S TOP 10

 

Pirates offer enticing
marketing promotions

7' ,

MCT Campus

Pirates center ﬁelder Andrew Mccutchen will have his own action ﬁgurine night on
April 23, when fans will receive one as they walk through the turnstiles.

_ Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staff Writer

 

It’s early April, and that means Pirates fans
get to occasionally say, “The Bucs are above
.500!” A

But more importantly, it’s time to plan
out your baseball schedule for the summer.
We learned last summer that the Pirates are
the best team in baseball — when it comes
to promotions and marketing. And let’s face
it, college students aren’t the most affluent
demographic, so what student doesn’t want

to take advantage of the Pirates’ giveaways? , -

So let’s see which games would be the best to
attend this year to get free stuff.

10. Buc Night — Friday, April 8, vs.
Colorado. It’s the second home game of the
season for the Pirates, and the team is offering
$1 tickets for virtually any seat in PNC Park.
Popcorn and hot dogs also cost just a buck.

How many other professional sporting events
exist for which you can get $1 tickets and food?
And it’s the beginning of the season, so the
Pirates haven’t been eliminated from playoff
contention yet.

9. Reusable Coffee Sleeve — Friday,
April 22, vs. Washington. This almost sounds
like a bad joke —,baseball is so boring that
you’ll need coffee. But why not embrace it?
How many times have you watched a game on
TV and it zooms in on a clearly uninterested
spectator? The Pirates have acknowledged
the fact that fans might need caffeine, so let’s
embrace it.

8. Andrew Mccutchen Action Figurine
— Saturday, April 23, vs. Washington. Mc-
Cutchen is one of the better center ﬁelders in
the game — which has led Pirates manage-
ment to pre—emptively quell trade rumors and
jokes by saying McCutchen won’t be traded
any time soon. This means that the market-
ing department can safely produce action
ﬁgurines to hand out to fans.

Roche’s walk—off hit
seals series win for Pitt

Baseball 4 14

the Panthers found a way to win.
In the bottom of the 11th, junior An-
thony Defabio led off with a single and
‘I "was bunted to second base by Konieczny.
For the second time in the game, Roche
came up with a big hit as he singled up
the middle, bringing home Defabio for
the winning run.
Roche’s walk-off hit resulted in massive
celebrations from the Pitt players.
“It felt great when Defabio slid in safe-
ly,” Roche said in an e—mail. “But when I
got bumrushed by the team, it turned out
to be the most painful hit of my career.”
“[Walk- offs] are the best by far,” Ches-
, ter said in an interview. “It’s so fun to be
‘£331 part of.”.”

Notre Dame 8, Pitt 6

Having clinched the series win, Pitt
looked set for a three—game sweep over
the Irish early in Sunday’s game.

The Panthers scored three in the first
inning, and after Chester hit his sixth
home run of the season in the third and
Pitt scored two more in the ﬁfth, they held
a 6-2 lead heading into the sixth.

But things fell apart from there. Notre

Dame scored one in the sixth and had a
five—run inning of its own in the seventh,
led by a three—run home run by Trey Man-
cini.

Pitt wasn’t able to force any late drama
this time, and it fell 8-6.

After Sunday’s loss, Chester and Smith
both said there were a lot of positives to
take from the weekend.

“It’s hard to sweep in the Big East,”
Chester said. “We felt really good about
how we played, and our energy was what
we really got excited about. We had some
great team chemistry and we’re almost
there. We just can’t wait to get back out
there again and play.”

“This weekend really showed what
kind of team we do have, and I feel it has
proven we can be the best team in the Big
East,” Smith said in an e—mail. “This team
is capable of great things. We just have to
believe it.” p

The Panthers travel to Ohio for two
mid—week nonconference games this week
against Cleveland State and Kent State
before returning home for another Big
East weekend series versus in—state rival
Villanova that starts on Friday. §

"~ “I was just happy about the race itse ,” Lowery

said. “We didn’t really have the best conditions
to run in.”

Despite the success, Lowery isn’t
done and still has some lofty goals.’

“I would like to lower my competition time in

400 hurdles,” Lowery said. “By the end of the
season my goal is to rim [a] 49.20.”

Jermaine Lowery:

place ﬁnish in the 400 hurdles — raking in a '

Kline could be reached for comment afterlthe
competition. A

of the hardestworkers and she really wants to do
well. She also loves the 400 hurdles.”

Similar to Cowsette, a big part of the strong

7. Skyblast Concerts. This year’s concert
lineup isn’t quite as impressive as last year’s,
but how often do you get to see a live sporting
event and a feature concert afterward? The list
includes Huey Lewis and the News on June
11, .38 Special onjuly 9 and Train on Aug. 6.
These events are all family—friendly — which,
in Super Bowl-halftime talk means that only
people who consciously remember the last
time the Pirates had a winning season will

A know all of the songs.

6. 1971 Ceramic Stein — Tuesday, June
21, vs. Baltimore. It’s 2011, which means that
the Pirates can celebrate another anniversary

of a championship. This year’s it’s the 40th an—‘

niversary of the 1971 World Series win. What
college student wouldn’t want afree ceramic
stein mug? I’m personally looking forward to
the 33rd anniversary celebration of the 1979
City of Champions. '

5. 1971 Championship Canvas Wrap —-
Monday,_]une 20, vs. Baltimore. While stein
mugs are great, the canvas wraps that the
team has been handing out are of surprisingly
high quality. The photo of the 1971 World
Series celebration is printed on a canvas and
wrapped around a frame that is perfect for
hanging on the wall. So if you just moved to
Pittsburgh for school, you can make it seem
like you’ve always been a Pirates.fan and that
you remember when they actually appeared in
the playoffs — when you were approximately
3 years old.— _

4. Free Shirt Fridays. If there’s one thing
college students love more than complain-

ing about being broke, it’s free T-shirts. Now V

there are many places to get free shirts, in-
cludingother city .sporting events. But with

most other giveaways, the shirts only come ‘

in one size: XXXXXL, I think. Although it’s
fun to sit in the stands and see how many

normal-sized people you can ﬁt in the shirt, '
the free shirt will likely never be worn again. .

But the Pirates actually have different sizes
sometimes, so you might evenbe able to wear
it after the game.
3. Reversible Floppy Cap — Monday,
July 4, vs. Houston. Unlike the shirts that
might actually ﬁt, this stars—’n’—stripes ﬂoppy
hat — the kind you might wear ﬁshing —

might never be worn again after the game. But '

after sitting in the baking sun for the Fourth of
July’ game lastyear, I would have truly enjoyed

a ﬂoppy cap. Besides, there’s no greater way. A
to celebrate the United States’ birthday than ~

sporting cheesy red—white—and—blue headwear
while watching America’s pastime. it
2. Fan Jam with the Steve Miller Band

— Saturday, Sept. 24, vs. Cincinnati. This _

is a new addition to the promotion schedule.
The Steve Miller Band will play a concert after
the game. And unlike the Skyblast concerts,
the Steve Miller set won’t be ‘interrupted by
gigantic ﬁreworks displays. Fans ‘can actually
focus on the music .— and save the ﬁreworks
for the top of this list.
