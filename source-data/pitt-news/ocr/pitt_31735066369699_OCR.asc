Since the publication of Alex
Haley’s Roots and the accompany-
ing television special, there has
been an increased interest
throughout the country in one’s
ancestral background. At the
Western Pennsylvania Historical
Society, Pittsburghers learn how to
go about learning their family
history.

The first ﬂoor of the society
houses a genealogical display
through August 10th giving tips
and pointers on how a person can
search for his/her roots. Gene-
ology, according to the display, is
the “study of family relationships
and the pattern they follow back
through the years.” ,

The best place to start when
searching for family background
and history is by interviewing the

Carter Cabinet, Members Offer Resignations

WASHINGTON-President Carter

) received offers of resignation

yesterday from his entire Cabinet
and senior White House staff
members and will consider them
“carefully and expediously,” press

secretary Jody Powell announced. .

A White House ofﬁcial who
asked not to be identified was
asked if Carter had solicited the

resignations and, dodging the
question, replied, ‘ ‘they were
offered. ’ ’

Asked why at least a couple of
dozen top people in government
would be moved simultaneously to
offer to quit without prodding, the
ofﬁcial responded: “We felt it to

ye an appropriate step to take at

this time.”
In addition to all members of the
Cabinet, the resignation offers

came from all presidential assis-I”

tants and special assistants,
including Powell himself. ‘

oldest members of the family
“before it is too late,” according to
the display. The elder statesmen of
the family can provide valuable
information as to where to start the
research. ‘C
After talking to relatives, it's
time to build a solid foundation to
begin the search by checking
through records at the county
court house. According to Helen
Wilson, librarian at the society, the
court house provides essential
family information like wills, land
records, and marriage certiﬁcates.

“These records help to locate
families geographically,” she said.

Other areas to research are
cemetary records, baptisimal certi-
ﬁcates, birth certiﬁcates and school
records, according to the display.

According to Wilson, after the
basic “homework” is completed.

T Other offers came from some
ofﬁcials who sit with the Cabinet,
such as United Nations Ambas-
sador Andrew Young.

Powell began his formal an-
nouncement by reporting Carter
had serious and lengthy discus-
sions Tuesday morning with the

Cabinet and with senior White ,

House staff members. He said
they reviewed administration pro-
gress and problems and discussed
future priorities.

'l'he press secretary announced
that all who attended the meetings
had submitted resignation offers
and concluded, “the president will
review them carefully and ex-
peditiously. ’ ’

The official who discussed the
situation anonymously said he had
no doubt Carter will acept some of
the resignations.

Talk of possible Cabinet changes
has-centered on Energy Secretary
James R. Schlesinger, who said

earlier yesterday he‘ told Carter ,

I further research can be done at the

Historical Society library or at other
local libraries, concentrating on
various historical records.

Wilson said the society’s library
is different than others because
“we give personal services to
people.”

The Geneological Society is
another source‘ of information
which can provide further detail on
how to search for family history.
The society meets the second
Thursday of every month from
September through December, and
the second Saturday of every
month from January through
February at the Historical Society.

Lectures, workshops and other

special features are included in the ‘

winter workshops, all designed to
help interested persons find their
roots.

some weeks ago that he planned to
resign “well before” the start of

Schlesinger has been the target

of much criticism for the nation’s
energy problems. .

Democratic primaries that I would
necessarily be an asset,” Sch-
lesinger said in an interview on
NBC’s “Today” show.

Carter early in the day, said he

SGB, Galanski Delay

‘Open’ Meeting With  

Board of Trustees

By JEFF COUCH
PittNews Staff Writer

Student Government Board
President Stan Galanski said
Monday the board will delay
further action concerning its June
15 resolution calling for the Pitt
Board of Trustees to hold an open
public meeting to discuss the need
and implication of the pending.
tuition increase. -

The trustees voted June 12 t
raise tuition 5 or 7 percent,
depending on state appropriations.
Both the State House and Senate
voted to give Pitt a 7 percent
appropriation increase for fiscal
year 1980. The bill now must be
signed by Governor Thornburgh.

“Through the series of meetings
(between Galanski and assistant
chancellor Ed Bozik), it became
apparent that we weren’t going to
get our request which I think was
obvious to us from thelbeginning,”
Galanski said at Monday’s SGB
meeting.

Rather than presenting the
resolution to ‘the Trustees this
summer, Galanski said it would be
advantageous to discuss the
resolution at the annual fall
meeting of the trustees. The
executive Committee of the trus-
tees will meet July 26 in what was
termed an “information meeting.”

“In our discussions, I felt that it
would not be a full board; it would.

only be an information meeting,”
Galanski said.

The SGB will use the time from
now until the fall meeting to
prepare its presentation, according
to Galanski. ’

“Most of the students are not on
campus now,” Galanski said,
“they are not here to hear about it
the resolution which is one of the
intents of our original resolution.”

In other action, the board voted
to co-sponsor the annual Semple
Street Fair held in September in
South Oakland.

The board members said co-
sponsoring the event will help
university-community relations.

‘‘I think it serves to integrate
student into the community largely
composed of students,” Galanski
said._ “People who have been long
time residents of Oakland may be
have had a bad experience with a
particular college student ten years
ago with that experience ﬁxed in
their mind, whereas all good
experiences they had may have
been shut out.”

The board also appointed a new
student member to the University

Senate Budget and Policies com-

mittee. Dan Shalenko, WPGH
general manager, will take one of
two vacant student spots on the
committee. The SGB will appoint
another student at a later date.

A new director of the Ofﬁce
of Student Activities will be
chosen sometime this week or
_early next week, according to
Conney Kimbo, vice chancellor
for student affairs. Four
people were recommended for
the job by a search committee
composed of students, faculty
and administrators.

Sources told the Pitt News

Kimbo Narrows Choice

yesterday that one of the
ﬁnalists was no longer in the
running for the job.

Another ﬁnalist has been
offered a similar job at another
institution, other sources said.
A When contacted by the Pitt
News, the finalist conﬁrmed
the job offer and said she is still
waiting for a decision on the
director’s job at Pitt.

While Carter was secluded at
Camp David for his “domestic
summit” there were unconﬁrmed
reports that his chief aide,
Hamilton Jordan, would be given a
new title and greater respon-
sibilities as chief of staff, in fact if
not in name.

Other unconﬁrmed reports have
said:

—Gerald Rafshoon, who did
Carter’s media work in the 1976
campaign and was brought to the
White House to help lift the
president’s sagging image, might
leave to work in Carter’s re-election
effort. ‘

—Frank Moore, the president’s
chief congressional lobbyist, may
be moved to a new position,
perhaps on the campaign.

—Powell might be moved to a
position with expanded authority in
the White House staff lineup.

The Ratings Are Out: What’s Next for Pittsburgh Radio?

By DAN SHALENKO

Pittsburgh’s radio ratings for the
first half of this year are in; and the
results are ‘sure to produce
shakeups in what this city’s
listeners will be hearing.

The bi-annual Arbitron survey,
conducted by the American Ratings
Bureau, monitored the listening
habits of the Pittsburgh market for

' a six-week period during April and
;May. ’

KDKA was once again the big
winner in», the numbers’ sweep-

5‘stakes,‘_ with a rating of 23.4, and 7

with peaks in the morning (Jack

“ _Bogut’s' show), late afternoon (the
j “90-to-6". newsjshow), and’ even-
. ing (the talk shows of Roy Fox and

  Cigna, which capture virtually
‘}_'the ‘entire over-40 audience).

g KDKA is, in fact, so entrenched

' as the -city's number one station
that it has seen ﬁt to go after its

closest competitor, beautiful music
station WSHH (8.7 rating). KDKA-
FM, which has in the past
programmed such stimulating fare
as the Ft. Wayne symphony, will
hire live talent later this year to

execute their own beautiful music
’ format.

Album-rock station WDVE

rising from a 6.98 last fall to a 7.6.

96KX made a comeback, ﬁnishing

‘WTAE slipped from a third-place
tie last fall to fifth for spring, with a
51 rating. Part of their loss is due
to the end of football season, with
Pitt and Steeler games their
biggest ratings-getters. Newcomer
Don Burns has not fared well in the

afternoon drive DJ slot either, also

contributing to lower ratings.
WAMO is next with a4.8 share,
its best showing in recent memory.
Despite the fact that WAMO
regards itself as a black-oriented,
rather than disco station, they have

WPEZ slipped from fourth to.

seventh with a rating of 4.5. This
was not unexpected as most of the
loss was in the teenage demo-
after the removal of
“Chilly Billy” Cardille from his

morning shift.

All-_news station KQV came up
with a 4.4 for its strongest showing
ever under the news format. The
acquisition of sportscaster Stan

‘Savran undoubtedlywas a factor

here. KQV’s ‘prospects only ﬁgure
to get brighter, as beginning this
fall all of the other (major news

departments in .town will begin

their casts at the top of the hour,

., while . KQV’s local ’ news segment

will begin at six minutes’ past.
Thus, if the listener wants news

during the hour, KQV will be the 9

only place to get it. The station has

also acquried Duquesne Basketball
for the coming season.

Soft-rocker FM97 is next with a
4.2, its best showing ever.
Beautiful music outlet WJOI
rounds out the top ten, with a 3.7
mark, down from 5.7 a year ago.
With KDKA-FM moving into this
area of programming, WJOI might
do well to dust off the rock ’n roll
records.

The bottom half of the listalso
produces some food for thought.
WEEP ranks 11th with a 3.4, its
best rating in some time, doing
country music, despite the fact that
they are only a daytime station.

13Q has fallen to 12th place with
an abysmal 2.9. The station has
never been able to shake the
teenage image it started with inthis
city, despite the fact that the kids
have long since gone to 96KX. New
13Q program director ‘Tim Powell

has begun to move the station in a
more adult direction since the
ratings ended.

WWSW lost big on country
music, falling to a 2.8. The station,
which ﬁred Stan Savran because
they felt he didn’t ﬁt their format,
has now done an abrupt about-face,
picking up Penn State football and
Penguin Hockey, both formerly
heard on KDKA. This ﬁgures to
help WWSW without hurting KD,
according to a reliable source at
KDKA, they let Penn State go
because the station could make
more money just playing‘ music

during that time. ...The Pens had 6

been paying KDKA to carry their
games; with WWSW, the normal
arrangement of the station paying
the team for broadcast rights will
resume. WWSW has also added

«longtime TV newscaster Adam

Lynch to its morning news team.

The most bizarre formats in the
city, WDSY (beautiful countfy,
2.3), and WIXZ (personality/coum
try, .9) are next, followed shock-
ingly, by WYDD. A survey done
last year by the Student Govern-
ment Board placed WYDD as the
second most popular station on
campus last year. Their only hope
as a rock station may now be to pick
up the audience of WWKS in
Beaver Falls, a perennially low-
rated progressive rocker, which
gave up earlier this year and
adopted an automated adult’-con-
temporary tformat. WYDD may
soon be forced to consider doing
the same.

Don’t look for changes right
away; most of the stations have
already decided to stick by their
guns for now. But if current trends
continue, the Pittsburgh airwaves
may be carrying some new voices
and different music next winter.

Two social work faculty members, Roger S. Albrandt, Jr.)

and James V. Cunningham, surveyed some 1200
households in local communities, plus 80 community
leaders and 40 urban families who moved to the suburbs.
According to the department of News and Publications.
the book is “based on the premise that neighborhoods are
the basic building blocks of cities and that healthy
neighborhoods are dependent on the willingness of its
citizens to invest and work in their behalf."
A According to the study reported in the book, city
government must help neighborhoods in order for them to
remain good living areas. Specifically, the book said that
city government must help develop large community
oriented organizations, encourage social activities “adopt
preservation strategies”, and improve public schools.

‘Quit Kidding Ourselves’
About America’s Energy Future,

Oil Executive Tells Media Forum ’

By The Associated Press

I  Sohio executive said yesterday

.he believed gasoline lines would

disappear by September, ‘but this
might ultimately spell more bad
news than good news for the
American people.

“We've had cheap energy.

' . We’ve got to quit kidding ourselves

that we have a right to that,” said
C.H. King, senior vice president,
marketing and reﬁning for The
Standard Oil Company of Ohio.
“It's gone.

“I personally believe you’re
going to ﬁnd, come September,
that gas lines disappear," King
said, speaking at a media forum to
explain the current gasoline short-
age. ‘‘If that happens, we're going
to forget the problems of May-June
1979. We're going to do that
because we're Americans.”

Stations Reopen on Pa. Turnpike

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Five gas stations on
Pennsylvania Turnpike that were closed last Friday
were reopened yesterday. the Turnpike Commission

announced.

The ﬁve stations. like the Turnpike’s 21 other
stations, will be open 24 hours a day. seven days a

week. '

.. Also, the commission said; purchases at‘

10 Exxon gas stations between Carlisle and suburban

the

Pittsburgh have been increased to $8. with minimum
purchases of $5.
The other 16 stations will continue the requirement

that motorists buy exactly $5 worth of gasoline.

Motorcycles are exempted from the rule.

Of the ﬁve stations closed between,Friday and,
Tuesday. two are near Philadelphia and two near
Pittsburgh.--‘ Thefifth is in iLancasier5County. ‘

President Carter's energy plan, but
warned it could take up to 10 years
to reduce this nation's need for
crude oil. He cited as reasons the
vast need for crude in the nations’

.basic industries and the difﬁculties
of developing synthetic fuels.

“This country is dependent for
its economic well-being on crude
oil. Any deferment is going to be
felt in the job climate, the
economy of this country,” King
said.

“It's going to be ﬁve to 10 years
to make much of a dent in the
volume of crude we need in this
country," he said. “I wouldn't
expect miracles tomorrow because
of what the president says today."

King cited several problems in
the development of oil sale on a
commercial basis: The energy
required to heat shale so oil can be
extracted can exceed the energy
produced; heating produces a
residual powder_with four times the
volume of the shales, creating a
disposal problem; the amount of
water needed in the extraction
process is not always available.

Coal, on the other hand, simply
isn't being mined in adequate
amounts, he said.

Sohio, which depends on crude
from Alaska's North Slope, has
maintained somewhat higher al-
locations than other oil companies.

Nevertheless, King said, it too has

an irrita-

been affected by the curtailment of
oil supplies from Iran.

Boron, a subsidiary of Sohio, is
operating this month at 90 percent
of its volume at this time last year.

Iran supplied 10 percent of the
world's crude oil before that
nation's upheaval late last year.
But when Iranian oil was cut off,
other oil-producing countries cur-
tailed supplies too, King said.

That 10 percent was eventually
felt across the board, even in the
U.S., which depended on Iran for
only 5 percent of its crude, King
contended.

“Unlike 1973-1974, the OPEC

. countries learned they don't have

to cut off all oil to get what they
want,” King said. “All they have
to do is cut back 10 percent to get
100 percent of the money on 90
percent supply."

Laserium: A Beauty You Must Experience to Believe  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

There is a particular show at Buhl
Planetarium: a show that in one form or
another’ has been presented there since
1977. '

The show is Laserium, a kaleidoscope
of colors and shimmering lights and

(shapes projected on the inside of Buhl

Planetarium’s Theater of the Stars dome.

What is Laserium? Put simply, it is the
light emitted from a one-watt laser beam,
reflected and’ refracted by angassortment
of mirrors into amazing moving shapes
and colors of light. The laser is perfectly
safe because it is so weak, and only about
one percent of the tube’s energy output is

harnessed anyhow.

The pulsating laser images are
accompanied by a soundtrack that can
rangefrom jazz to classical music to rock.

So '...- the show has played at such
cities as Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago,
Toronto, San Francisco, San Diego, New
York, Honolulu, London and Kyoto,
Japan. There are now 13 locations

different by the laserist (laser artist) who
works the controls himself, making each

Arlo Guthrie Proud of Folk Music
Heritage, Blasts Critics

By MARK HOLAN

One of America's most popular and
lovable folk singers, Arlo Guthrie, thinks
that most people in the country today
don’t understand what folk music is all
about. Instead, he insists, they’re caught
up in fads and scholarly classiﬁcations.

“Folk music isn’t a style,” Guthrie said
in a recent phone interview. “Bluegrass,
blue, jazz, hillbilly, country western and
disco are musical styles and any of these
areas have the potential to become folk
music. You just have to wait about 200
years and see which ones remain in the
culture.”

“Music is the product of culture going
through changes.” Guthrie adds, how-
ever, that “people have become alienated

. frotn their own culture by scholars who

don’_t know what their talking about.
Young people who’re convinced they
don’t like folk music are listening to the

- radio everyday; guys who’re writing it

(music) are convinced they are not writing
in a traditional manner. \Both creators
and people who are listening to music
become alienated.”

“he’s not as proliﬁc a writer as his father

Was. ;

“My old man never let‘ a tune, go
through his head without writing it
down,” he said.

Arlo is currently on tour promoting his
twelfth album, “0utlasting The Blues.”
He said he likes touring now more than he
did in the past. A

. “I used to have to perform because I
was either broke or didn't know what else
to do or nothing good was on television.
I’m traveling with good people and it's
kinda fun," he said.

Guthrie, who performed at the
Woodstock festival in 1969, said he
wasn’t disappointed. to hear that the
proposed Woodstock 11 festival fell

through. ’
“I think it was just a bunch of people
out to make money," he said.

Asked what he thought about young
people today as compared to the youth of
ten years ago, Guthrie_said that young
people are basically the same.

“They are only different because the
times are different. That’s th_e_way it

laser images. It had been done once
before without music (just the images) for
the Pepsi-Cola Pavilion at Expo '70 in
Osako, Japan; but it was Dryer who made
Laserium what it is today.

He first presented Laserium in Los
Angeles’ Griffith observatory in Novem-
Soon afterward Dryer was
given the go-ahead, and the show opened
in New York in 1974 at the American
Museum of Natural History, Hayden
Planetarium. The Laserium fever spread,
and over the past five years the company
that Dryer formed in 1971, Laser
Images, has produced three series:
Laserium, Laserium II and Laserock.

To give the reader an idea of how far
Laserium at Buhl has come—.—the current
feature is billed as “The Best of

ﬁrst three series. The second feature

Buhl’s laserist is Ross Webb.

“Laserium is a unique form of
entertainment that combines music with

synergy," Webb commented.

“Basically my job is to choreograph the
light to the music—-—it’s not a film, it's not
a videotape, nor is it completely
programmed. The show happens live as I
‘play’ the laser console, in much the same

‘way that a musician would play an

“It’s gratifying,” Webb added.

And it is equally gratifying to the
audience. Webb operates the laser
console beautifully in time with the
music. He communicates his love for his
work to the audience, and makes them
more enthusiastic also.

‘Scapino’: J Lots Of Laughs At The Laboratory Theater

Scapino ,.
Directed by Melanie Smith
Pittsburgh Labratory Theater

By MARK HOLAN

For those who enjoyed the greeting line
at the beginning of “An American
Dream,” getting your seats at “Sca-
pino,” Lab Theater‘s summer interlude
of “experimental dinner theater,” is
guaranteed to be a real joy. Headwaiter
Vito («Fred Marco) ushers members of the
audience to the basement of the theater
which is set-up to be an intimate cafe.
-Patrons receive a menu (actually the
playbill),while waiters pour wine and
serve breadsticks. A gypsy violinist
strolls among the tables playing beautiful
Italian melodies. .

A light and relaxed mood is
immediately established. When the
performance begins, however, the mood
quickly changes to one of frivolity and
belly-laughter.

“Scapino,” based on a comedy by
Moliere, involves the delightfully un-
scrupulous antics of the servant Scapino,
played with a clever charm by Paul Rosa,
and his sidekick Sylvestro (Louis Taylor).
Scapino’s friends, Ottavio (Lamont
Arnold) and Leandro (Scott McWilliams)
are unable to enjoy an open relationship
with their lovers because of paternal
problems. They seek Scapino’s counsel
and cunning in hopes that all may be well
again.

With this classic plot ‘as a foundation,
“Scapino” becomes a contemporary
commedia del’arte piece with the addition

\

of hearty slapstick, quick double-talk
and one~liners, slang, song and dance.
All are served-up in generous portions
and the intermission between acts is the
only time the audience gets to catch a
breath from so much laughing.

Melanie Smith, directing only her
second play at the Lab, has done a fine
job of putting together and controlling
“Scapino’s” wonderful madness. The
production skips merrily along that fine

line of being overdone without ever,

falling over the edge.

Especially good is the scene where
Scapino cons Leandro’s father Geronte
(Marc Selvaggio) into hiding in a burlap
sack so he can be saved from the mythical
mobsters who are out to get his money.
Scapino then procedes to abuse the old
man as he mimes a pirate, a karate
kicking Easterner, and the leader of a
British Army regiment.

But the true commedic tour-de-force of
this production comes with the wild chase
scene towards the end of ' the play.
The entire cast gets in on this and Smith
expertly employs the old barrel trick not
seen at the Lab scene since, “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern. ”

The Italian accents, like so much pasta,
get a bit heavy at times and much of the
dialogue gets lost in the play’s fast pace.
However, since words seldom make or
break successful slapstick, this doesn’t
hurt the production that much.

If all dinner theater was like “Scapino’ ’
it would ‘be advisable to keep the food
intake as light as the fare, otherwise
there’d be alot of sore bellies---not from
indigestion, mind you, but from so much
laughing. This is a very pleasing

CMU Ends Summer Season With iMo|iere’s

The Miser
Directed by Gregory Lehane
Carnegie-Mellon Theatre Company

By JANICE SCHULER

. “The Miser”, by Moliere, has opened
at the Kresge Theatre, as the
Carnegie-Mellon Theatre Company’s last
production for this summer. David Ball,
the literary director, has come up with a
new translation of this pungent comedy
about avarice and lunary. In his
translation, Ball has taken some of the
edge off the biting humor usually
synonomous with Moliere.

The story is about a preposterous miser
named Harpagan who buries his gold in
his back yard for safekeeping, then
becomes paranoid that someone will steal
it. He is suspicious of everyone in his
household: his servants, his children and
even himself. There is an unforgetttable
scene when he is alone on stage and
grabs his own hand in his pocket and
says, “Gotcha!”

Harpagon has two children, Cleante,
his good natured, but somewhat vain son,
who is in love with Mariane, who just
happens to be the same woman Harpagon
wants to marry. Elise is the daughter of
Harpagon and in love with Valere. the
personal advisor and confidant to
Harpagon. Valere serves the ludicrous
and selﬁsh Harpagon only to be near his
beloved Elise, while he searches for the
whereabouts of his long lost father.

There are many disappointments in
this production. The set looks very
cheap, (maybe it is Kevin Rupnik’s idea
of a pun). There are white sheerts
everywhere, the walls in fact seem to be
made of sheets. They work well on the
chandelier, however, evidence of Har-
pagon’s frugality, but the rest of the set
is annoying and distracting, even the

doors seem to have a cockeyed
construction. ..

The tempo of the play is too fast, with
everyone rushing on and off stage, and
the actors’ racing_ through their lines,
leaving no time for visual reactions.

Harpagon is played by C. K.
Alexander, an enormous talent and the
focal point of this production. Alexander
is a long standing veteran of the theatre,
having nearly two closely packed columns
in the current “Who’s Who in the
American Theatre” listing his credits on
Broadway, Off Broadway, regional
theatres and television. Some of his
Broadway credits include his per-
formance as Peachum in Joseph Papp’s
Public Theatre production of “The Three
Penny Opera”, “Tovarich,”, “Rhino-
ceros”, “The Matchmaker” and
“Fanny”. As Harpagon, Alexander is
the highlight of this production.

There is one point in the show where he
is almost doing a stand up comedy act.
He gets so suspicious of everyone, that he
starts accusing the audience of stealing
his money, and goes out into the theatre
to recover it. He approaches a woman
and takes her purse, emptying its
contents on stage. This is great fun for
the audience, but it would’ve been more

convincing if there were more things in-

the purse.

There are memorable performances by
Jon Polito as Anselme and Master Simon,
Elizabeth Orion as Frosine and Leland
Starnes as Master Jacques.

The flamboyant costumes are designed
by William Brewer. They are amusing
and make some of the characters look
totally ridiculous, like Anselme, who

appears as the long lost father of Valere ‘

and Mariane, who was dressed practically
in white, with a long ﬂowing platinum wig
and what appears to be a white studded
cowboy hat. Frosine, the adventuress,

looks the most clownlike in clashing ice
cream colors with all sorts of useful
matchmaking aids hanging from he!‘
attire. ~

Every character in the play gets angry
at Harpagon at one time or another and
delivers poignant one-liners about his
stinginess. Frostine pursues him by
saying she hopes they change him rent in
hell. Cleante complains that his father
doesn’t give you a good morning, he

And a hilarious annecdote he is. This

Eastwood's ‘Alcatraz’ Powerful, But In Unusual Way

Escape From Alcatraz

Columbia Pictures

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

In the past several years Clint
Eastwood has built up a following of
devotees to his particular style of acting.

In “Dirty Harry,” for example,
audiences thrilled to Eastwood’s crazed
violent streak. They cheered when he
produced his .44 Magnum and indif-
ferently destroyed parts of,“ villains

‘The Kids Are Alright’

The Kids Are Alright
Directed by Jeff Stein

By MARK HOLAN and SCOTT MOWRY

No one has ever understood the rock ‘n’
roll mystique better than The Who. In the
ﬁlm, “The Kids Are Alright,” they prove
their mastery without question. ‘

For the past 16 years, The Who have
ripped apart, destroyed, recreated,
transformed, and expanded the meaning
of music far beyond the poind of a mere
pleasurable listening experience. To The
Who, music-rock ‘n’ roll, was a way of
life. If anything hasbeen overlooked.
forgotten, or lost in the past decade and a
half, “The Kids Are Alright” will teach it
all over again. .

More than a documentary, “TheKids
Are Alright” captures the heart and soul,
the power and eloquence, the scope and
vision of one of the most inﬂuential bands
of the genre’. Not just a movie for Who

. followers, this is a must for rock fans

everywhere. ,

’ Directed by Who fanatic and-
conoisseur Jeff Stein, “The Kids” traces
this monumental group from its humble
beginnings to its major triumphs, with a
candor and unpretentiousness other rock
pictures have lacked. The movie does not
so much_ glorify the group as to present an
honest portrayal.

Unintentionally, this ﬁlm stands as a
ﬁnal memorial to the late Keith Moon.

drummer extraordinaire, lovable lunatic-

and an energetic inspiration to countless
others. For all those fans who were
never able to witness Moon and The Who

in concert, this film is not a bad _

substitute.

Practically stealing the show, Moon
rolics and cajoles as the camera catches
some of his zaniest and most manical
moments on and off the concert stage.
Almost ironically as his stunts become
more outrageous, the destruction of the
man unfolds with unbelievable horror.

Despite Moon’s antics, however, it is
Pete Townshend who emerges as the
leader and driving force behind the band.
His contributions include not only
writing the majority of the group’s lyrics
and music, but more importantly. he has
been the vigilant captain at the helm of
this band’s ship,‘ guiding it over the often
rough seas of 16 years on the road. It is
no secret that there were often internal
conflicts among The Who. Townsend’s

vision of the Who’s role in the rock ‘n’ roll

world is what ultimately kept the band
together. * ,

More so than Moon, or the sexual
attraction of Roger Daltrey, Townshend
was the focal point of any Who concert,
and hence this movie. His guitar playing
on stage has been matched by only an
elite few (Jimmy Page, Keith Richards‘,
Jimi Hendrix and Alvin Lee) and is
surpassed by no one. The famous
windmill chording and scissor kicks have
become legendary and a trademark of the
word of rock.

Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle,

through out his ﬁlms, from “Magnum
Force” to the so-called “spaghetti
Westerns,” to “The Outlaw Josie
Wales,” where Eastwood sent a record
60-plus people to the afterlife.

Therefore “Escape From Alcatraz”
should be approached with caution. After
last year's disastrous “Every Which Way
But Loose,” audiences attending this
movie were uncertain whether they would
see Eastwood pull out a large handgun
and start blowing people away, or begin
clowning around with an overgrown

orangutan.

however, are not to be discounted.
Daltrey’s curly blond mane and dynamic
vocals are also a trademark of ‘this
legendary band. An_ Entwistle’s stoic
stage presence and conﬁdent bass lines
have also been a necessary part of the
band’s sound. Often, in fact, as Moon
went off on manical tangents, it was
Entwistle who kept the rhythmic stability
in tack.

Randomly, the screenplay jumps from
live concert footage to interviews and
lively vignettes that give a behind the
scenes perspective of the rock superstars
seldom seen. The concert action moves
from TV appearances (The Smothers
Brother Show, Shindig, and the Rolling
Stones Rock and Roll Circus) to
Woodstock to club dates to a gigantic
outdoor show in Michigan.

The most dramatic moments in the film
occured during specially arranged 1978
shows in London, which feature knockout
performances of “Baba O’Riley” and
“Won’t Get Fooled Again,” complete
with blue and green lasers. The band’s
somewhat joking rendition of the Beach
Boy’s classic “Barbara-Ann" is

especially delightful.

Although material from the Who's last
three releases, “Quadraphenia," Who

\ByyNumbers,” and “Who Are You” is.

This ﬁlm proves how far Eastwood has
come—he projects tremendous power.
There’s no weapon in sight. It’s 1960,
and he's been sent to Alcatraz
because he has escaped from just about
everything else. After hearing the
warden conﬁdently proclaim, “no one has
ever escaped from Alcatraz, and no one
ever will,” Eastwood is determined to
give it his best shot.

The incredible thing is the laek of.

Lowe and Rockpile Steal Show, Blondie Fails to Entertain

Blondie/Rockpile
Stanley Theatre
July 11, 1979

By scorr MOWRY

Perhaps the best way to recount the
feeling from the Blondie/Rockpile stop-

. ;ver at The Stanley Theatre is to start at

the beginning. Otherwise justice may
never be served to those who deserve it.

Opening act__ Rockpile, consisting of the
combined geniuses of solo artists Nick
Lowe and Dave Edmunds, plus ace
sidemen Billy Bremner and Terry
Williams, is probably one of the ﬁnest,
most explosive warm-up bands on the
concert circuit today. With their basic
garage band set-up of two guitars, bass
and drums, this group delivers more rock
‘n’ roll punch than most of the
platinum-plated heavyweights currently
racking up the big bucks. They proved so

stage.

Like a breath of fresh air, Rockpile’s 50
minute performance relied on a
spontaneous, youthful, almost magical
exhuberance, miles above “me
competition. Where a good band rocks,
the greatness of Rockpile rested in their
ability to roll as well.

From their kick-off numbers.
Edmund’s “Ain’t Nobody” and Lowe's
“So It Goes," Rockpile laid down a line
of musical adrenaline that increased
steadily throughout their set. Trading off
songs and lead vocals, 'Lowe and
Edmunds’ styles easily complimented
one another as they fused late-Seventies
pop with Fifties rockability. Fun, fast and
furious. Rockpile raced through 14 songs,
each one charged with an electricity and
excitment.

Rockpile seemed to be at its most
exhilarating when Lowe handled the
vocals and Edmunds let his Gibson guitar
soar like on “Swithchboard Susan,”
“Born Fighter”. “Love So Fine”, and
“They Called It Rock." those were the

\

highlights, but others such ‘as “She Used
to Rock ‘n’ Roll”, “Calling from the
Wreckage”, (written by Graham Parker)
and Chuck Berry’s “The Promised
Land”, cooked almost as torridly.

By the time Blondie hit the stage with
the opening chords of “Dreaming" from
their debute album, much of the
enthusiasm in the half-capacity crowd
Stanley Theatre had been swiped away by
Rockpile. Not until their ﬁfth number,
“Picture This", did the momentum
ﬁnally swing in Blondie’s favor, a fact
that seemed to leave the New York
new-wavers frustrated.

Led by the provacative Debbie Harry,
blondie played tight, engaging avant-
garde and pop rock, heavy with hooks and
melodies, strong with arty lyrics and
urban emotion. Guitarists Chris Stein and
Frank lnfasnte, keyboardists Jimmy
Destri, basist Nigel Harrison and
drummer Clem Burke furnished a solid
musical and visual accompianment as

Harry freely roamed about, commanding .

the spotlight wherever she went.
Dressed in a tight, bright scarlet suit, her
bared shoulders in harmony with her
peroxide hair, Harry’s striking stage
presence provided an ravishing contrast
to the black and white clad musicians
behind her.

Like an enigma, always changing,
never the same, Harry acted out the
people and..personalities of the group's
boy-girl repertoire culled from three
albums. At times, Harry can appear sexy
and wanton as a pin-up girl or fresh and
innocent like the one next door, and still
other times she looks every bit the part of
a sultry and seductive bombshell. But
mostly, the vulnerable, unsure side of
Debbie Harry showed itself, more often
than not. reflecting the fight for survival
characters she sang about.

Whatever, the mood, Harry’s voice
blended powerfully and sweetly with
the music. She demonstrated her
dynamic versatility in songs like “Picture

punk rock roots and buried the monster

“Heart of Glass” was tinged with a more
rocking arrangement that sliced the disco
version to ribbons. “‘Slow Motion” from
a forthcoming record, “11:59”, “Hangin’

also featured some nice driving

Appearing calmly, before his congre-
gation, Taylor opened the first set with
soothing acoustic pieces: “Something In
the Way She Moves”, “Riding On A
Railroad” and the poetic “Carolina In My
Mind".

Gradually, an impressive line-up of
side-men was introduced, until J .T. had
brought the house to an ecstatic pitch,
with some of the purest rocking and
rolling to be found anywhere. Songs such
as “Johnnie Comes Back” and the super
standard “Steamroller Blues” gave the
audience an excellent opportunity to see
Taylor stripped of recording studio
perfection. He has always been better
live, and so have the members of his
band, who lashed out some fabulous
solos.

Taylor seemed to enjoy personal
entertainment on the side, from his
regulars: Danny Kortchmar on electric
guitar, Russel Kunkle on the drums, and
Leland Sklar, better than ever, on the
bass. They were joined by Don Grolnick
on keyboards, David Sanborn on tenor
sax, vocalists David Lasley and Arnie
McCuller, and a rather hyper-active
Waddy Wachtel, who lurked around the
stage with an electric guitar like the good
fairy. With the blending of the old and

However, answering with only a single
encore, “Kung Fu Girls”, Blondie was
never able to tap the enormous potential
they seemed capable of, especially with
the ever increasing popularity of their
latest “Parallel Lines” album. Unfortun-
ately, their concert appearance at the
Stanley was competent, but not up to the
fever and pitch Rockpile mustered.

Regardless of the quality of the
individual performances there was little
doubt that the Stanley played host to a
chunk of future rock superstars.

shyly as one might serve explanations to
an angry teacher. But his soft-spoken
nature exploded, wide awake, 'as he
performed the most memorable songs of

“Long Ago and Far Away,”
Jones’ “Handyman,” and “Mexico,” a

Taylor can sleep as late as he likes, and

“Sweet Baby James," “How Sweet It

“Summertime Blues,” and closed with
“Fire And Rain.”

Larry Coryell opened the show, packing
a half hour with “Spain” and
“Wonderful Wolfgang” among the tunes

that half the audience was still being

'l'riumph’ant Group Fuels Excitement,

Triumph
Stanley Theatre
July 8, 1979

By GARY L. TWEED

A capacity crowd ‘filled the Stanley
Theatre for a showing of the Canadian
rock band Triumph. The show opened
with Roadmaster, an average rock and

roll band, followed by the Babys.

The Babys did three numbers of above
average rock. About three bars into their
fourth song the curtain closed on the

I Babys and their act.

The lead singer of the group had been
kicking around some lighting equipment,
and although a stage hand had run out to
warn him against this, the Babys, in the
ﬁtting style of their name, did not listen.

After a 45-minute interlude to set up
Triumph’s equipment in which the crowd
almost went out of control at the seeming
affront of closing the Babys down early,
and six people were expelled from the
Stanley, the headline act made their
appearance.

Triumph is not your normal rock and
roll band. Their show encompasses
fever-pitched, high-energy sound which
only the more formidable rock establish-
ment such as Yes and The Who are
capable of projecting. The show opened.

. with the tune “American Girls” off the
'group’s new album “Just a Game.”

Firey explosions and artful light displays
complement the high-energy sound.

The show alternated between songs off
Triumph’s ﬁrst album, “Rock and Roll
Machin” “(Street Fighter,” “Blinding
Light Show”) and songs from their recent
RCA release, “Just A Game” (“Hold
On,” “Lay It On The Line”, “Movin’
On”). The live version of “Rock’n’Roll
Machine” featured a guitar solo by Ric
Emmett displaying his agility on slide,
electric and acoustic guitar.

The band also featured a rendition of
“Rocky Mountain Road” by Joe Walsh.

Ric Ocasek, group leader, played a role
not even secondary but tertiary behind

trappings to perform.

A If the crowd thought the previous acts
were good, they were ecstatic with
Hatchet. It wasn't long before Hatchet
had the audience up and " moving,
crowding the front of the stage. A
performance of “Gator Country” that
was truly complimentary and faithful to
the recorded version got a particular rise
from the crowd. In truth, it’s easy to see
why Hatchet mentions all those bands in

In the encore number, “Takes Time,”
drummer Moore declared, “Let’s tear the
roof off this fucking place.” Given the
energy Triumph projected, it was

amazing that such a thing didn’t happen.

At Stanley

“Gator Country”—they have taken
something from each of these, assimi-
lated and changed it a bit, and_ have
produced a new sounding conglomeration
that is uniquely their product.

But there areproblems. For example,
lead vocalist Danny Joe Brown had no
actual stage presence or power. At times
he appeared to be simply a singer hired
by the guitarists to round out the act.
But consider, Molly Hatchet are still a
young act. This will develop in time.

And so will their material. As their
record catalogue grows, so will their
selections. They will become more
balanced—instead of the continuing long
(and at times very nerve-wracking) guitar
solos, the audience will be treated to a
more reﬁned, sound with the band’s
power more focused. They will then be as
professional in appearance as the ﬁrst
two groups that opened.

But “That ol’ time rock’n’roll” still
exists. ‘Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly
would be pleased, wherever they are.
Rock is still alive, as these three acts
proved.

the leads on “Let the Good Times Roll,”
“Best Friend’s Girl,” “Candy-O,” “I
Got a Lot on My Head,” and the falsetto
parts on songs like ‘‘All Mixed Up”.
Guitarist Easton tempted the crowd at
the edge of the stage with pis solos,

staying just out of reach of the-

outstretched hands. At the endof the
show he shook these hands, though.
Hawkes provided ample keyboard
accompaniment. Particular songs that he
was feature on included “Let’s Go” and
“Moving in Stereo.” But he played well

on the other ones also, never failing to
capture the essence of the recorded work.
At times the mixing board caused his
work to be obscured, however.

When other groups have glaring or
even not-so-obvious mistakes or problems

in performance that invite criticisms, the, ;

Cars show that they neither invite nor
deserve such criticisms. But they do
deserve the success and fame they are
currently enjoying. Iq these days of
“uncertain rock,” the Cars are just what
we needed.

Charlie Daniels Touches Are Audience as Few Can Do

Charlie Daniels Band
Civic Arena
June 23, 1979

By MARK HOLAN

“My Daddy once told me to do
something I enjoyed, because. like most
people I’d end up working more than not.
He was right."

The big man with the tallest hat.
Charlie Daniels, has certainly found work
he enjoys. A father ﬁgure to the
countless Southern-hearted hell-raisers
across the land, Daniels was a totally
consuming and awesome presence at the
Civic Arena.

The concert opened with “Passing
Lane," one of the singles from the
recently released “Million Mile Reﬂect-

‘ ion” album. From the beginning, the

music rough-housed fans out of their
chairs and into the aisles, and the Arena
was jammed for the occasion.

“Trudy," from an earlier L.P.,
followed before the CDB got back to the
new material. A moving version of “Re-
flections”. an in-memorium of Elvis
Presley, Janis Joplin and Ronnie Van
Zant via lyrics and slides, was undoubltly
one of the evening’s highlights.

\

Throughout the show, whether on old
favorites like “Long Haired Country Boy,
“Birmingham Blues" and “Sierra
Madres" or the newer material like
“Potion For The Pain,” featuring
excellent keyboard and vocal by Joe
“Taz" DiGregorio and “Devil Went
Down To Georgia,” (which Daniels
announced had just gone gold, and
proceeded to pass around a bottle of
champagne), the CDB was tight in its
musicianship. proud and strong in it's
delivery and just a hell-of-a-lot of fun.
The crowd went bonkers on every
number and Daniels responded after
each, ‘ ‘ IapreeechEEEaatit. ’ ’

Encores included “People of Texas,”
“South’s Goin Do It Again” and “Orange
Blossom Special,” with Daniels playing a
frenzied ﬁddle on each.

Opening the triple bill show was the
Henry Paul Band (who appeared earlier
this year at the Decade). The band
performed material from it’s newest
album “Grey Ghost," including the title
track single. 3

Sandwiched in the middle of the show
were favorites Pure Prarie League who
warmed up the crowd with such favorites
as “Amy” and “Two-Lane Highway.”

Who Soundtrack Adaquately Captures Band's History

The Who ,
The Kids Are Alright
MCA Records
ByiGARY GRAFF

On one hand, we have the Who.

’ Arguably the world's ﬁnest rock outﬁt.

certainly one of the most durable.
Capable of high energy rock and roll at
it's best, and innovators par excellence-
the ﬁrst “punks."

On the other hand. we have the
product; a two record soundtrack from
“The Kids Are Alright." the band's
history movie.

There is great temptation to say that
the album shows the Who at its best.
proving that no other band can or ever
will be like them.

Many will argue that in actuality. the
Who are unsurpassable. “The Kids Are
Alright," however, doesn't uphold this
statement. The record displays the
Who’s development as a live band, from
the version of “I Can't Explain" off a
“Shindig" TV broadcast, to the studio

version of “Long Live Rock.”

The latter song could serve as the
overture for the album, as Roger Daltrey
shouts “Rock Is Dead." The kind of rock
the Who knows is dead. and “The Kids
Are Alright” serves as a testimony to that
style.

It is. however, an imperfect testimony.
There are songs that beg for better
production, performance, or both, but the
majority are representative of the Who’s
greatness in rock history.

Enclosed with the package is a booklet
featuring the best published concert shots
of the band. including pictures from
Woodstock and out takes from the
“Who's Next" photo sessions. The text.
lends some insight into the band's
history.

The performances from “Who's Next”
are the most striking on the soundtrack.
“My Wife" loses a bit when John
Entwistle drops his bass to play the horn
parts, but it's still as much fun as the
studio version. The synthesizer programs
of “Baba O’Riley" and “Won’t Get
Fooled Again" are on tape, but these live

versions are even more energetic,
especially Entwistle’s bass on.“Baba"

The Woodstock performances of songs
from “Tommy” belong to guitarist/
leader Peter Townshend. He slashes
through “Sparks" and “Pinball Wiz-
ard" as ifhis life depended on it, giving
Keith Moon barely enough space for his
manical drum triplets.

Conspicously absent are many pieces of
“Quadrophenia," the Who's second
full-length “rock opera.” Nor are there
any tracks from “Who By Numbers” or
“Who Are You."

In other words, we are given the golden
age of the Who; material that was, for the
most part, critically acclaimed and served
to establish a reputation, not tarnished as
many contend these latter albums have
done.

The best single performance on the
album is that of Daltrey’s. Even on poor
versions of “I Can't Explain" and
“Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere." Dal-
trey’s voice stands out as superior, even
in its younger form. The vocals on
“Young Man Blues" and “Won’t Get
Fooled Again” conﬁrm Daltrey as a

matured rock singer with a consistently
powerful attack. .

A rare medley of “Join Together/
Roadrunner/My Generation Blues,”
along with “A Quick One,” the miniopera
from the Rolling Stones’ aborted “Rock
and Roll Circus” alone make the
soundtrack worth aquiring.

For the obligatory “My Generation,”
though, a performance from “The
Smother’s Brothers” show was chosen,
which like many television performances,
is a‘ studio recording, and the guitar-
drums smashing at the end is hardly as
exciting an auditory experience as it is
visually.

There are certainly better versions of
much of the material on “The Kids Are
Alright.” That’s not the point, though; if
every track was perfect, cleanly produced
and overdubbed, the soundtrack would
lose its perspective as a vehicle for
tracing the development of the band.

Are the Who the best rock band in the
world? “The Kids Are Alright” isn’t an
absolute ‘yes,’ but it makes a good
enough case for the band.

New Earth, Wind and Fire LP Mixed To Sheer Perfection

I

By DAVID STUBBS

Earth. Wind and Fire
I Am
ARC/ Columbia

“I Am" is the tenth album by the
ihultidisectional group, Earth, Wind and
Fire. Describing or deﬁning this album
can be quite difﬁcult because there are so
many ways of looking at Earth, Wind and
Fire. .

if familiar with any albums by Earth.
Wind and Fire prior to “That's The Way

Of The World," one should know that in
very many ways this is not the same
group. For one thing, the tunes on this
album do not contain the inspiring lyrics
contained in past songs such as "Head To

Sky." “Remember The Children," .or
“Devotion." Another difference lies in
the manner which the album was
recorded.

The tracks on this album are mixed to

sheer perfection. The vocals weave in and '

out while the horns punch out crisp and
accurate rhythms. Every piece of this

album is about as perfect as the material
can be.

“Boogie Wonderland," ‘‘Star,’' and
“After The Love Is Gone" are examples
of how well produced this album is. All
three of the tunes are mediocre by Earth,
Wind and Fire standards but the songs
are so well arranged that even the most
critical of fans can appreciate the artistry
contained in this album.

Earth, Wind and Fire is without a
doubt one of the more talented and
progressive acts in the modern music
industry, but it seems they may have

developed an album formula.

An album formula is acquired when an
act ﬁnds that a certain combination of
songs will sell a desired amount of
records which yield a desired amount of
ﬁnacial satisfaction. For the last three
albums Earth, Wind and Fire has used
the formula, one dance single, two more
dance songs. three short love songs and
and an instrumental. Not to say that
there is anything wrong with a
successful formula, but Earth, Wind and
Fire is much too creative in group to
become predictable.

Parker Finds ‘Squeezing Out Sparks’ Yields Success

By SCOTT MOWRY

Graham Parker and The Rumour
Squeezing Out Sparks
Arlsta

Passion, intensity, originality,
‘excitement, sincerity and integrity are
traits too often rare in the music of the
1970's. They belong to only a handful of

_ artists of this otherwise laidback decade.

_The Who, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling

 Stones, Elvis Costello, The Clash, Neil
 . Young and Bob Dylan head that elite
‘ . company. But those words only begin to

describe the depth and vision realized on
Graham Parker and The Rumour’s recent
release, ‘ ‘ Squeezing Out Sparks.’ ’

From the varied, tough guitar playing
_to the raw and furious emotions to the
muscular drumming and to the
desperate, ‘shivering vocals, this record is

g breathtaking. , As it seems to lunge at you

from within the speakers, the album is

l . like a catapult launching rock ‘n’ roll right

into the 805. H

On all levels, Graham Parker fashions
his unhinging motives around refusal:
refusal to hide behing a detached, ironic
voice but instead openly expose himself;
refusal in “Local Girls” to accept a world
he has become fed-up and dissatisfied
with; A refusal in “Don’t Get Excited” to
settle for passiveness, boredom and
apathy, and even a refusal of romance as
a savior in “Love Gets You Twisted.”

Whereever he points his finger, Parker

. shoots straight from the hip. He clearly

wants to shake you up and move you to
But mostly,
Graham wants to ‘make damn sure you
feel.

“Passion Is No Ordinary Word” which
closes side one, accurately speaks for the
conceptual bravado behind this album
and for that matter, Parker’s life.

As a key to his rationale, this song
establishes Parker’s artistic significance
in’ terms of his decisive and
uncompromising ideals. With a hard
edged warning he snarls the refrain:

Passion is no ordinary
Ain’t manufactured C
By just another sound
That you hear at night. \

On their aim-for-the-gut level, Parker
and Co. don’t have to so much say it as do
it. With the sheer power and tempo of
the music, the messages are slammed
home with enough conviction that you
don’t always have to hear Parker’s words
to get the meaning.

Next to the growling and commanding
vocals, the rich lead guitar of Brinsley
Schwarz jumps from the mix to punctuate
Parker’s lyrics. Schwarz makes his
presence felt from the very ﬁrst note of
“Discovering Japan”, the opening track
that kicks this album into high gear. His
sizzling licks continuously knife across
the songs like a streak of lightning

through a stormy sky, always different,

never less than exciting.

As much "asit carves out new direct-
ions, “Squeezing Out Sparks” indicts the
past as well. Parker consistently
challenges‘ the lack of nerve in the
decadent me-generation. He takes
pot-shots at a number of’ 70s hits
including the disco-mentality in “Satur-
day Nite Is Dead,” the need for financial]
security and emotional ‘ safety in
“Protection” and the quest for an alien
alternative in “Waiting for the UFO’s.”

But perhaps ‘the songs that most

'ambitiously demonstrate the all

encompassing intensity of the man are
the introspectives “You Can’t Be Too
Strong” and “Nobody Hurts You”.

Where “Nobody Hurts You” rocks
with a committment to self-honesty,
“You Can’t Be Too Strong” sentimen-
talizes a chilling fact of life. In the latter.
accompanied by just an acoustic guitar
and a soft electric piano, Parker sings
hurt and deﬁant, hard but still warm
with compassion, representing the
starkness of his subject—abortion.
Initially, he reaches to fix blame on the
woman, too weak to have the baby, and
the doctor too weak to’ refuse the
operation. But ultimately, it is Parker as
a symbol for all men, who shoulders much
of the guilt. By the end of the song, he
has acknowledged his own weakness as
well. Certainly no ordinary rock’n’roll
dream.

Following on the heels of an ill-received

studio album “Stick To Me’; and a
sloppy live record “The Parkerilla”, new
producer Jack Nitzsche, a prodigee of the
legendary Phil Spector, has captured the
deﬁnitive Graham Parker sound to date.

“Squeezing Out Sparks” cracks and pops B

and scinillates as if the vinyl was on ﬁre.

It can be aggressive yet sensitive, direct
yet understanding, harsh yet human, but
always, it is as real as life itself.

New Band  

Fail On Debut LP

Steve Hackett
Spectral Mornings
Chrysalis Records

By GARY G-RAFF

The tragedy of Steve Hackett’s latest '-

release is an affirmation of English
progressive rock’s demise. While
established acts like Yes and Genesis
continue to plod through tried and true
formulas, Hackett joins the ever
increasing group of artists (Fripp, UK,
Bowie)— in a course of avant-garde
overindulgence.

“Spectral Mornings” is an unfortunate
debut for Hackett’s new band. who
perform admirably when the material
allows. The opening cut, “Every Day,”
is outstanding, sounding like a remnant
from Hackett’s days in Genesis. He

delivers a slashing guitar attack while

singer Pete Hicks and bassist Dik

Cadbury provide strong harmonies.
“The Virgin and the Gypsy” is a

pleasant ballad featuring John Hackett’s

Chinese bamboo ﬂutes. Hicks performs .

another ﬁne vocal, coping well with the
over-imagery of the lyrics.

“The Ballad of the Decomposing 5

Man,” which proves once ‘again that
Hackett really can’t sing, is a diversion
from the rest of the album, with good
keyboard work from Nick Magnus, and
Cadbury’s calypso bass. At the end of
side one, “Decomposing Man” turns out
to be the last redeemable song on the
album. .

The principle problem here seems to be
Hackett’s wish to play free form under a
rigid song structure, two styles that
have never mixed well. Particularly
troubling are the instrumentals, which
lack overall coherence and quality.

“The Red Flower of Tachai Blooms
Everywhere” is as overblown as its title
suggests. Lush Koto and oriental
rhythms are out of place, and apparently
out of Hackett’s ballpark. “Clocks-the
Angel of. Mons” is the: type of
instrumental every progressive act has
done at least once, and it pales‘ greatly to
other Hackett instrumentals from
“Voyage of the Acolyet” and “Please
Don’t Touch. Magnus’ synthesizers are
tiresome and the furious drum “solo” by
John Shearer at the song's end is
unnecessary.

The most disappointing of the
instrumentals, however, is “Lost Time in
Cordoba.” The spook show of. sound:
layers of guitars, keyboards, flutes, etc,
are downright boring, grinding into
another dull piece called “Tigermoth.”
While Hicks’ vocal is adequate, the lyrics
aren’t, and neither is the music. Hackett
is as comfortable with English folk
melodies as he was with Chinese styles on
“Red Flower,” and it shows.

The .title track would finish the album
well, but Hackett overextends himself
again. Despite his lyrical guitar leads and
a much more coherent arrangement,
“Spectral Mornings” lasts too long, with
the intricate rhythms quickly becoming
redundant.

With a regular band, Hackett has the
potential to get away from the
hodgepodge of styles that victimized
“Please Don’t Touch.” On that album
however, the songs were more
structured, giving some identity to the
music.

“Spectral Mornings” has no identity,
though only excess. Each song is
different enough to seem out of place,
and Hackett and his band‘ seem
comfortable only with a handful.
