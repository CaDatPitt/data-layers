Reduction in Library Use
Forces Shortening of Hours

The library hours for the
spring term are shortened be-
cause fewer students are using li-
brary facilities, stated Dr. Clar-

A ence W. Stone, director of the

central library and educational
media studies. A committee will
continue to study the effective-
ness of this arrangement "and
other factors concerning the li-
brary.

The library is presently under-
staffed, Dr. Stone said, but not
entirely because of the ﬁnancial
difficulties of the University.
When the need arises the staff
-will be increased to meet-the re-
quirements of the faculty and
students. No one has been releas-
ed from the staff as a result of
the cutback, he said.

Democrats
Organize
On Campus

For the ﬁrst time in several
years the Young Democrats (YD)

on campus are forming them- ’

selves into a year-round political
organization. The ﬁrst YD meet-
ing Monday at noon in 91 SU is
open to anyone interested in
joining the group.

The Pennsylvania State ‘Demo-

cratic Committee recognized the

need to organize University stu-
dents and has contacted a group
of campus students for this pur-
pose.

YD will provide a forum for
college students to meet and dis-
cuss with prominate political ﬁg-
ures, obtaining the practical pol-
itical experience not found in
the classroom. The YD’s expect
to organize groups now to_ lay

the ground work before the fall, .

according to one of the coordina-

tors.

The library hours are as fol-
lows: The reserve book room is
open Monday through Thursday
8:301 a.m. to .9 p.m., Friday. 3:30
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m.

The _periodical room is open
Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m.‘ It is closed Saturday
and Sunday.

The circulation room is open
8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through

_Thursday; Friday, 8 a.m. to 6

p.m.; .and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. The reference room is open
Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m.; Fri-
day, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Satur-
day, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday,.the
circulation and reference room
are closed. ‘

Delay Might
Cause Loss

Of Grant

Governor William W.
Scranton recently stated
that lengthy delay in state
consideration of a cash grant
to the University could cre-
ate problems because the,
state budget is expected to
be set and appropriations bills
passed, before the expiration of
60 to 90 days. “Then where
would we ﬁnd the money?” Gov-
ernor Scranton .asked.

If the state board agrees to the
State Council of Higher Educa-
tion recommendations, a detail-
ed study into the University’s fu-
ture relationship with the state
will be made by hired experts in
60 or 90 days.

Chairman of the Council Charles
G. Simpson was not interested in
Governor Scranton’s 60 to 90 day
state budget deadline. “State bud-
geting is not the business of the
Council,” Simpson said, “We have
no part in it; we don’t ‘know it.

“But we do feel that the state
should know all about Pitt —
what it. is doing and where it is
going — before another grant is
made. The Commonwealth knows
very little about the University
of Pittsburgh despite the fact that
it has provided the University
with close to $50 million in the
past decade,” Simpson said.

He felt that it was a “de-
plorable situation” on the part
of the state, for it is the Com-
monwealth’s responsibility to un-
derstand the need and the use of
the money.

Simpson agreed that the Uni-
versity will need as much as $5
million over the next 14 months.
The $2.5 million emergency loan
he hopes to obtain at the com-
pletion of the recommended study
would be a short term loan from
private ﬁnancial or banking in-
stitutions. Simpson felt that the
loan would satisfy the Universi-
ty’s ﬁnancial needs until the Sep-
tember tuition money comes in.

Disturbances
Charged .
To DeMo1ays

By LEE SHEVKE

The DeMo1ays, a fraternal
organization sponsored by
the Masons for young men
from 14 to 21, were charged
with creating disturbances
in Tower A, by John Bender
head resident of the Towers.
They were housed there this past
weekend as part of their state
convention.

Bender stated that the DeMo-
lays threw cherry bombs and
waterballoons from the windows
on Saturday night. He said that
he received complaints from res-
idents in the other Towers con-
cerning the noise these chaper-
oned guests created.

Adviser of the host DeMolay
chapter, George Cromlish, Jr.,
denied that any members of his
chapter, Templar, caused any
damage.

As night watchman for the
Towers that evening, William
Stead stated that the Towers, ex-
cluding the lobby, were check-
ed two or three times for Uni-
versity students, and as the De-
Molays were the only guests in
Tower A for the weekend “who
else could be responsible for the
ruckus? Stead said. “It was the
worst night I can remember in
the Towers.” -

Frats Hit
On Rushing

Violations

Corrective action has been
taken against an undisclosed
number of fraternities fol- -
lowing detection by the Dean
of Men’s Office of rushing

to 16.

Parker Ehwright, assist-
ant dean of men in charge of-
fraternities, said that the action
was designed to correct the sit-
uation rather than to punish the
fraternities in-.
volved. He de-
clined to com-
ment on the de-
tails of the sit-
uation, saying
that the infrac-
t io n s . wer e
“rather vague.”
  “Certain ac-

DEAN tivity can go on
ENWRIGHT that is not de-
ﬁnable,” he continued. “You can't

pin down speciﬁc things.”

The exact nature of the action
taken was also not released... al-

    

made public. The action which

so far are open to appeal in the
fall. depending on the conduct of
the fraternities involved during

sions. _
Dean of Students ‘Helen Pool

tion committee, said that no ma-_
jor changes are planned for next
year's program "because of the
infractions. “The situation is cor-
rectable,” she pointed out, and
therefore the program need not
be changed. .

She explained that the strong
action taken » by the administra-

remaining sessions in this year’s_'

program.

Ten Year Report

Expansion, Change Cited in Report  

BY MARSHA REHNS

(This is the first in a series of
articles on “The Report to the
Community,” a recently publish-
ed study of the University’s
progress since 1955.)

A student-faculty ratio of
8 to 1, the trimester sys-
tem, the Department of An-
thropology, the Student Un-
ion and Towers dormitories,
are all part of the expansion
and change which the Uni-
versity has experienced in the
past ten years.

When Chancellor Edward Litch-
ﬁeld was appointed to lead the
University in 1955, it was essen-
tially a regional school, “lacking
much in terms of all-around fac-
ulty ability program, standards
and physical plant.” *

At that time Pittsburgh was un-
dergoing its own physical renais-
sance and it was apparent that
“an intellectual and academic
renaissance was equally’ neces-

 

sary.” The trustees therefore
made a commitment,’ the report
explains, “to achieve the highest
possible level of excellence in
the briefest possible time, and to
achieve it throughout the Univer-
sity.

One of the University’s fore-
most efforts Was directed toward
the faculty. In order to improve
the staff, four criteria for evalua-
tion effectiveness as a teacher;
research and scholarship pro-
fessional stature; and contribu-
tions to student life, the depart-
ment, and the administration —
were established, as well as a
more recent committee to investi-
gate whether sufficient emphasis
is placed on teaching as opposed
to individual research.

Of the 591 full-time faculty
members, 250 were judged below
standard by a committee work-
ing to the criteria. In four years,
all except 42 such members, the

‘report points out, had resigned
e or ' improved their ‘_ performance

To revise the salary scale, as
an incentive to new faculty mem-
bers, every division of the Uni-
versity chose another institution
with which it wanted to compare.
New scales were setup to bring
salaries up to levels comparable
to those of these institutions by
1960. This as well as constant re-
vision has doubled faculty sal-
aries.

A $12 million grant from the
Mellon Educational and Charit-
able Trust enabled the University

-to bring well-known scholars

from schools including Yale,
Johns Hopkins, and Oxford. An
improvement in the calibre of
professors was obvious when in
1960, 72 per cent of newly hired
faculty members had their doc-
toral degrees as compared to‘ a
national average of 36 per cent.

Statistically, the student-fac-
ulty ratio decreased from 12 to 1,
to 8 to 1, since 1955 with 1,091

The report comments that there

must be maintained at a compe-
titive rate. Individual research
should be fostered and it is hoped
that by 1970, 90 per cent of the
faculty will have doctoral de-

students. The caliber and geo-
graphical distribution of these
students has noticeably improved.

The class enterting last Sep-
tember contained twice as many
valedictorians as the class before
it, and 60 percent had grad-
uated in the upper ﬁfth of their
class (twice as ‘many as ten
years ago.) Average scores on Col.
lege Entrance Board examina-
tions ‘(ﬁrst required‘ at the Uni-
versity in 1958), have increased
76 points in the verbal scholastic
aptitude test and S3 in the mathe-
matical.

University Aid
Bishop Urges

Bishop John J. Wright of the
Pittsburgh Diocese, in a recent
statement expressed his optimism
that financial aid for the Univer-
sity will be forthcoming.

“Obviously no discussion would
be held if there were no possibili-
ity of some species of state aid,”
he said.

“The visit of the Commonwealth
representatives to the University
suggests that there is not merely
full awareness of the meaning of
the emergency to our general
community, but a sympathetic
desire to discover how the state
can properly help,” he pointed
out. -

Bishop Wright especially men- _

tioned the mutually beneficial re-
lationship between the University
and the Commonwealth. “The
present critical moment in Penn-
sylvania history is no time for a
major university to be embarras-
sed by a shortage of the funds
needed to do its job,” he com-
mented. “Now seems the timefor
al men to come to the aid of the
party. The party this time is
Pitt.”

Faculty Improved

Whereas only four per cent of
the 1951 freshmen came from
outside Pennsylvania, 34 per cent
of last fall's class was from the
other 49 states and 60 foreign
countries.

Since 1955, full-tme enrollment
in the graduate school has in-
creased by almost 50 per cent
with a decrease of 300 in part-
time. They are presently 907
"graduate "students with fellow-
ships and traineeships as com-
pared with 153 in 1955.

To accommodate the increase,
the University has acquired 17
new buildings and six new
schools and department. This ex-
pansion will be discussed in the
next article.

Two-Party Politics on Campus 

  Apathy Must Stop

 By Linda Goldstein

“All the way with LBJ” resounded through the walls
“of the University last fall with an enthusiastic and almost
deafening clamor. The organizational meeting of the Young
Citizens for Johnson- Humphrey group brought hundreds
_of ‘ready volunteers ‘to the cause of the Democratic Party
-in the 1964 election.
3 f Yet shortly after November 2 there ceased to be any
fworkable Democratic organization on campus. A Young
. -  Democratic club was launched, but support
for it was almost nonexistent. Following
the Johnson landslide, students who had
supported Johnson ceased even to be affili-
ated with any official organization. At the
same time the Young Republican group was
faced with recovering from an ignoble na-
tional slaughter. ,
It rallied in the face of defeat, however‘,
:  holding regular meetings, sponsoring guest
‘ V   speakers, and publishing its own newspaper.
M188 GOLDS'l'ﬂN Many students who support the Demo-
fcratic Party made the mistake of assuming that the fight
was won because Lyndon Johnson received an overwhelm-
-ing mandate..They fail to realize that their apathy is the
very medicine the Republican Party needs to strengthen its
"forces. ,
. ‘ THE LAST presidential election was unique in the mar-
gin of victory earned by President Johnson. Statistics of
previous elections illustrate that the winning candidate is
usually only a few percentage points ahead of his opponent.
Even President Johnson's landslide, the greatest in the his-
_tory of our country, cannot be interpreted as a sign of com-
‘ plete receptiveness to the Democratic Party’s cause.- While
the election is a sign of victory it should also serve asa
stimulant to spur Democrats to establish a strong party
that can produce decisive victories on a steady basis.-
 i At the Uniyersity, students interested can do their
 part by developing an active two-party political. system on
‘ V-campus. If the Republicans can maintain a year-round cal-
1 endar, the Democrats, who greatly «outnumber their opposi-
-tion on campus, can establish an effective organization that
‘would allow students to choose between the two parties.
 ~. College political organizations, as a source of potential
l.1",;»-voters, have the advantage of being an attraction to po-
‘I : litical figures. It hardly need be said that the college campus
represents the centralizing of the most.thoughtful and in-
jtelligent of the nation’s youth. Whether it be for’ realistic
or altruistic reasons, all major political figures realize the
-‘importance of this group. ,
"WITH TWO -active political clubs on campus, events
such as organized debates ‘where students could put their
ideas and ideals to a test could be planned. Competition
would insure that each club would develop its potential to
the fullest extent. ‘
. Most important, two _sucessfu1 political organizations
would provide an opportunity for students to acquire a first-
 hand knowledge of the inner-workings of politics, for the
- active college political group is a source of power that can-
 not be ignored by the senior party.
.. College students rally to such causes as Civil Rights
in an admirable way. Let us not forget, however, that it is
through our two-party system that these causes are devel-
oped into laws.

The other day as I strolled through the
quad with my friend, Fat Howard, I noticed
a young man with a very perplexed look on
his- naive face.

“Can you tell me where _ the Student
Union is?" he asked me.

I thought, “He doesn’t know where the
Student Union is; it is a cinch that this _lad
has been here but a short time.” Bril-
liant deductive powers like that have helped
me tower over the intellect of my compan-
ions, especially over Fat Howard.

Fat Howard said to the lad, “I cannot
tell you where the Student Union is.”

“Why, sir?” said the lad.

“Because I cannot talk to you.”

“Why not, sir?”

“Because I am a fraternity man, and you
are obviously an orienta.” Fat Howard likes
to coin new phrases. ’

“Fat Howard,” I-said, “you know you
are not supposed to .talk fraternity to these
boys. What is wrong with you? Don't you
know what ‘happened last week during ori-
entation ?”

“No. What happened?” _ .

“I’m not sure myself, Fat Howard. It’s
rather vague.”

Upon learning that we were fraternity
men, the lad began bombarding us with
questions, such as: “How muct does fra-
-ternity cost” etc.

Fat Howard replied, “I’m sorry I cannot
answer any of these questions. As you
know, fraternity men are incapable of being
objective. As it is, I have spoken to you

too long and may have jeopardized my fra-
ternity’s charter. But, if_ you have a min-
ute, I will give you some advice.”

“Oh, please. Iwill heed any advice you
give me,” said the lad.

“My advice is simply this. If you see
any other fraternity men, during your three
days here, please be kind to them, for theirs
is a terrible cross to bear."

“During the spring term there are not
many merry folks here and one gets very
lonely. All through May and the first half
of June we look forward to the orientations
waiting for your bright, eager faces. But,
woe be us, now that you are here we cannot
talk to you. We cannot go to Jazz Night.”
Now he was weeping openly.

“We cannot eat with you or wish you
luck at Pitt. We cannot talk to freshman
girls. We cannot go to the snack bar or sit
on our motorcycles in the quad. If we rev

up our Hondas too loud it is di’rty"rushing. ”

I hear that next week we won't even be able
to go to classes because freshmen might be
touring the nationality rooms. Go now, lad,
and if you see a fraternity man, smile and
try to cheer him up.”

The lad turned around, head down for
he was now weeping, too. “But why don't
they let you do all these things?” he asked.
“With you around we kids can really enjoy
orientation."

“I know, son, replied Fat Howard.
“Last week we weresaround and the kids
had fun. This week having fun is against
University policy.”

The Need Has Arisen 

Open-Door Policy for Libraries

 By Peter Herman

Two weeks ago I was as
annoyed with the University
as I have ever been. It was
8:30 p.m. and I was looking
for a place to study for my
my organic chemistry test.
There was no place to go.
It was impossible to study
at home so I went to Scaife
Hall library. When I got
there I found that it closed
at 8 p.m. during the sum-
mer. I then went to the Ca.-
thedral. By the time I got
there I had fifteen minutes
to study before the library
closed at 9 p.m. From there
I went to Langley Hall. That
was a little better. I had 45
minutes before it closed at
10 p.m. I finally ended up
studying in The Pitt News
office. '

, But what happens to the
students who don’t have an

.c-ffice in the Student Union

to‘ retreat to? Where do they

- go to study? After 10 p.m.
Sunda;{.._..there., _isn’_t_ :

a_library open to the Oak-
land area. One has to have
super-human powers of con-
centration to study in the
Towers lobby with the TV
blaring and ping pong games
going. The Student Union is
usually quiet and the chairs
are comfortable but there is
never enough light or a place
to write. One should be able
to study where he lives but
it doesn’t always work that
way. It’s not easy to tell a
roommate to get out of his
room. He usually tells" you
to go find some place to
study——so Where do you'go?

YOU DON’T go to a li-
brary if it's after 10 p.m. or
a Sunday. Library service
was reduced for two reasons,
according to Dr. Clarence W.
Stone, director of the central
library and educational me-
dia studies. First not enough
students were using the li-
brary and second the library
is presently understaffed be-

cause~of.~._noifinal summer cut-

 

backs and the University’s
current financial difficulties.
When Dr. Stone announc-
ed the library cutback he
said that if the need arises
the staff will be increased to
meet the requirements of
the faculty and students.
Dr. Stone, I sympathise with
the problems that you have,
butthe need has arisen.

 THEN EED has arisen for
a ‘well-lighted, quiet, com-
fortable place to study.
Scaife Hall Library used to
be this kind of place; it was
even air conditioned. Air
conditioning is too much to
ask for I suppose, but an
open library is not. There
is no reason why the Uni-
versity cannot keep the Ref-
erence room or Langley Hall
library open until midnight.
A ‘cosmopolitan university”
owes it to its students, no
matter how few they may
be,to provide "a place to con-
duct the business of a uni-
versity.:;,__s,tudy_.» - ..

Letters to the Editor

Towers Students
Protest Guests

This is a copy of a letter sent
to Curt Roemele, director of
men's housing. I
Dear Mr. Roemele:

A missile such as a water bal-
loon, dropped from a height of
nine stories can be fatal to a
passer-by. Just such an incident
occurred on Friday evening, June
18. A balloon ﬁlled with water
was dropped from the ninth
ﬂoor of Tower A, narrowly miss-
ing a University student. Tower
A was occupied at the time by
one of the groups of high school
students this University has seen
ﬁt to board in our dormitories.

We would like to be enlighten-
ed. Have the Towers been re-

I named the “Towers Hotel?” Will

every organized group of young-
sters who can muster the funds

have the right to impose on and

frequently annoy the full-time
students, and childishly roam the
campus and Oakland area in their
crisp new “Pitt” sweatshirts giv-
ing the University a bad name?

r

How can University dormitory
living rules, such as those against
opening of windows, room dam-
age, property damage, etc., be”

' maintained if such tennants as we

have seen continue to ﬂaunt au-
thority? If University students
did such acts, severe disciplinary
actions against them would re-
sult. This is not justice—it is just
a matter of economics.

The students do not live in the
Towers for a pittance.’ We pay‘
well for service, privacy, secur-
ity, and enjoyment of college at-
mosphere. We feel that we are
justiﬁed
things.

A college dormitory is not
meant to be a YMCA. We believe
that the dormitories and their
facilities should be reserved for
the resident students as original-
ly intended.

  ‘Joe Friend Opposes
.   Column, Track Set-Up

(The following column is the unedited content of a letter sent

by Joe Friend to Sports Editor Bill Cabin. Friend was a three-

year track letterman and won the Charles Hartwig Award last
year as the athlete who did most to “promote athletics at the
University.” He is currently enrolled here in the Graduate School

of Education.)

In his effort to improve a supposedly adverse situation
_within the track program, sports editor, Bill Cabin has em-
ployed a style best described as “O’Brienism,” which un-
fortunately produces many hard feelings, but few if any

constructive results;

More disheartening is the fact that the most deleterious
effect may not be upon any one person, but upon the morale

and reputation of the team.
Therefore, several factors must
be brought to light in regard to
the editorial (The Log) of June
9, 1965.

The first involves several cor--
rections in the entirely one-sided
article, and the second pertains
to. a possible solution to the
problem as it now exists.

The statements pertaining to
Damien Koch as being a sprinter,
and a. top University athlete were
obviously printer's errors, al-
though this minor mistake he-
comes more serious in view‘of
the number of readers unfami-
liar with the track team or the
critic. Koch can best be des-

’ cribed as merely a distance. run-

ner with much potential.
The fact that Koch was notiﬁed
that he would be competing in
the ICAAAA championships only
several days before the meet was.
for the following two reasons,
-(according to ‘coach Rees. It ap-
peared at ﬁrst th_e ﬁnancial plight
.of the athletic department would
not permit more than one car

.- load of ‘athletes to make the trip,
which would have excluded
* Damien.

Later it was discovered that
money would be available for

* . another-car. Also, previous to the

ICAAAA meet, a practice meet
Vir-
gina, for which Damien did not
appear.

Perhaps the most serious accu-
sation was that of the inference
of open argument between head
coach and assistant coach con-
cerning coaching procedure. This
did not occur.

Differences of opinion must
necessarily arise. in any normal
coaching situation, for no man
can know absolutely the best

method for developing an ath- .

lete to his greatest potential. So,
naturally, disagreements did
arise, but open verbal rebuttals
between coaches never occured.

As for the fact that Pitt has
not been a top track power in the
past decade can not be denied.
Perhaps this is what disturbed
Damien to the greatest extent.
However, before a criticism can
be directed at any one person, or
even to a team, two questions
must be asked.

Does the University of Pitts-
burgh want a nationally recog-
nized track power, or does it
want a mediocre squad with a
few potential scorers in cham-
pionship competition? Hopefully
it wants the former. Essentially,
the reason that the latter condi-
tion prevails lies predominantly
in philosophy.

Two decisions must be made
by all involved in directing the
track program, or Pitt will never

again become a track power. (It
is assumed that the athletic bud-
get. for track presently can not,
and probably will not, bein-
creased.

First,‘the commitment to dual
meets must be abandoned. It is
ridiculous to compete against a

50 man team from Army or Navy“

with a 12 to 15 man squad as
Pitt has done and must continue
to do. Also, the expenses involved

in traveling are phenomenal‘

when considering bus rental, food
and lodging for the team and
coaches.

Second, the team must become
specialized in certain events, and
then compete in top invitational
competition. For example, the
choice may be to bring in some
of the best high school half-
milers, in order to develop a
two-mile relay team.

Recruitment of such personnel
should be easy. It would be dif-
ﬁcult for a school-boy to refuse
a full scholarship to run in pri-
marily championship competition
throughout his college career.
Following this ‘procedure pres-
ently are teams such as Morgan
State, Georgetown, and Fordham,
which are highly respected in
eastern competition for their ex-
cellent relays and individual per-
formers.

Pitt can beat, and has beaten,
Morgan State in dual meet com-
petition. Yet, Morgan State is
considered a track power; Pitt is
not.

Ironically, the cost of operat-
ing such a team would be much
less than the costs presently in-
curred for operating a dual meet
team. With the personnel on the
present squad, Pitt has had offers
from meets such as the Philadel-
phia Inquirer Games, to bring a
couple relays and several indi-
viduals, expenses paid.

A good relay team would have
Pitt jerseys ﬂashing all over the
east coast, at no expense to the
University for transportation costs,
lodgings or food.

In short, if the University is
to regain prominance in the
track world, two courses of ac-
tion are possible. Either the num-
berand quality of scholarships
must be increased greatly, or
more emphasis must be placed
on a small specialized team as
outlined brieﬂy above.

In light of the present ﬁnancial
situation, it appears that there is
only one alternative. Hopefully,
both the athletic department and
the Pitt News will alter their ob-
jectives somewhat — the ath-
letic department toward a more
effective track program, .and the
Pitt News toward a two-sided ap-
proach to “The Log” editorials.

Track Mentor Defends 
His Coaching Concept

By BILL CABIN

Track coach Carl Rees Claims recent accusations about
his coaching are “slanderous, unethical, and embarrassing.”
Rees’ rebuttal opposes runner Damien Koch’s criticism of
poor coaching of the track team.

Koch originally cited Rees’ giving runners inadequate
notice of meets, disagreement between assistant coach Jim
Banner and Rees, Rees not taking Dick Crout to the IC4As,
and Bill De1Vecchio having to pay his own way to the Cen-

tral Collegiates.

“I don’t want to say anything to embarrass or ridicule
anyone anymore,” said Rees. “Damien (Koch) has been dis-
satisfied since he came here, and he is still quite confused

about many things.”

“He hates rimning on the hard
wood track in the ﬁeld house,
since it hurts his legs,” said Rees.
“So we adjusted his training
schedule, giving his most of the
practice outdoors.” But Koch
also had academic problems. He
is currently on probation and will
be transferring in the‘ fall.

“He had trouble combining good

academic goals with his high ath- _

letic aspirations,” said Rees.
“Both -coach (Jim) Banner and
I spoke with him and told him
he could do both, but it was up
to him.”

Koch, however, feels both Rees
and Athletic Director Frank‘Car-
ver were putting the burden of
responsibility on him. “I talked
to them both,” said Koch, “and
they said it was all in my men-
tal attitude and not the failure
of the track team.”

Rees staunchly contends none
of Koch’s criticisms were valid.
First, Koch said he. did not re-
ceive notice about his participa-
tion in competition until four
days before the event.

“There were two reasons for

that,” said Rees. “We had a prac- ‘

tice meet with West Virginia af-
ter our last regular indoor meet.
Koch did not show and did not
tell me in advance. I felt he
needed some further discipline.
‘ “The major reason was ﬁ-
nances,” said Rees. “Mr. Carver
was uncertain of our ability to
send more than three or four
boys. -But all were to train re-
gardless, though they may not
have practiced the same routine
if they had known they were go-
ing definitely.”

Rees fervently denied open
disagreement with Banner, ex-
cept once during the past year.
“We disagreed only about enter-
ing (Jim) Higgins in one or two
events in one meet. Otherwise,
we both accepted one another’s
suggestions freely." '

Crout’s case still seems debat-
able. He was the team's third
leading point scorer at the end
of the season. “He was a good
man .and scored a lot of points
for us,” said Rees. “But he left

something to be desired in the
last meet, and I felt he w.asn’t
material for the IC4A.” Crout
took two thirds in the last meet.

DelVecchio’s case was again
linked to the University’s general
ﬁnancial woes. “He went to Mr.
Carver and asked if we could
send him to the Centrals,”, said
Rees. “Carver told him we didn’t
have the money now.

DelVecchio offered to pay, and
Carver told him the University
did not like athlete's to pay
their own way. He told DelVec-
chio he could pay his own way
and to get receipts with the
chance the school might get
enough money to pay.”

        

Despite his denial of Koch’s

criticism and calling him “con-
fused,” Rees accepts some blame.
“In addition to skills, we try to
give our athletes character and
ethics,” said Rees. “I feel we
must have failed in his case, and
therefore take part of the blame
for his having this attitude- But
I also feel his high school coach
and _teammates are responsible,
said Rees.

Rees and former track star

. Joe Friend (see Friend's column

on this page) feel much of Koch’s
dissatisfaction is his disappoint-
ment that the University is not
a major track power.

Friend ‘offers a_ new approac,
of recruiting runners for big
meets and not concentrating on
a dual meet schedule. Rees feels
this is not an ethical approach.
Instead he clamors the well worn
and true lines about needing
more money.

“Villanova, Michigan and other

schools go out and buy a reputa-, -:

tion,” said Rees. “In order to
compete with track powers, we
must be able to compete in aid.
We need more scholarships ‘to
draw high class high school tal-
ent.”

Rees blames ﬁnances, Koch
blames Rees, and Friend blames
the University’s track philosophy.
Either way, there’s something
wrong and someone better choose
the right track.

Sweetmeats Meet GSPH Colts Monday;
Pi Lamb Aims For First Place Laurels

By GEORGE LIES

Next Monday’s softball
game between the MBA
Sweetmeats and the GSPH
Colts may decide the Intra-
mural League pennant win-
ner. Only three postponed

contests hinder each team.
The Sweetmeats (4-0) defeated
_the Counselors, 10-5, last Thurs-
days, but still must make-up
games with Circle K and the Dent
Molars. The Colts (5-0) must also
reschedule a game with the Mo-

lars.
These games are crucial to Pi

Lambda Phi,.which has a 6-1 rec- -

ord Their only loss was to the

  
 

Sweetmeats, and Pi Lamb plays
the Colts today at 5 p.m. at Trees
Field. If the Colts beat the MBAS
and lose to Pi Lamb,- Pi Lamb
will move into ﬁrst place.

The Colts took ﬁrst place last
Monday. when Bnatton’s Bruisers
forfeited a game to them. The
Colts now hold a half game lead
over the Sweetmeats, and are
only .142 percentage points ahead
of Pi Lamb. '

In other games last week,
GSPH beat Circle K, 11-3; Pi
Lamb downed the Molars, 9-4;
and the Dent Inlays forfeited to
Pi Lamb. _

Aided by a two-outerror on a

slow roller in the ﬁrst inning,

  
 

Wayne Walker led the ’Meats -‘if’;

the victory over the weak-hitting
K-boys. With men on ﬁrst and
second, Walker hit an “easy out”
to the shortstop, George Lies,
who picked it up, dropped it,
and then kicked it away, allowing
an eventual four run rally.

Ed Zelnick had two singles and
a homer in four at bats, and Haf-
vey Kopelowitz had two singles
in four at bats, pacing Pi Lamb's
win. Dave Baum allowed the Mo-
lars only six hits, while his team-
mates compiled 14 hits.

D0 CHAMBERS prepares to leap after softly hit ball against West
Virginia last season. Chambers was also the starter this year.

STRONG PEG to first baseman Brian Fisher during 1964 season shows
accuracy which made Chambers a staunch defensive catcher.

  

Free Agent
- Gets.  1 000

By TOM SACKS ‘

Failure permeates. all as-
pects of academic life in col-
lege, but people associate the
word with collegiate base-
ball. For catcher, Doug
‘Chambers, baseball failure
threatened his entire way of life.
Baseball has been Chambers
world since his childhood. That
world had apparently been shat-
tered when Chambers, possibly
the best catcher in the school’s
history, was not selected in the
recent Major League draft. His
hopes were revived several days
ago when he signed with. the St.
Louis Cardinals as a free agent.
The one thousand dollar bonus
and ﬁve hundred dollar a month
contract is not overwhelming in
view of the big money being of-
fered these days by professional
teams. “What is really important
is that I have .a chance to play,”

said Chambers. ‘
“It just doesn’t make sense to
me,” continued Chambers. “Since
I’ve been playing here at least
ﬁve scouts have contacted me
about my interest in playing pro-
fessional ball. When I wasn’t

drafted, I was really hurt.”
Every game I've played I've al-
ways made it a point to compare
myself with the opposing catcher.
There were only one or two that
I thought might have been better
than me. When I looked at the

Catcher Doug Ch

draft lists there were two West
Virginia catchers and one from
Penn State. I just couldn’t ﬁgure
it out,” Chambers said.

Chambers was contacted sever-
.al days after the close of the
draft by St. Louis scout Timmy
Thompson. Thompson had been
scouting him for several years.
“Mr. Thompson tried to write off
the draft by saying that since the
Cardinals had the last draft
choice they knew they had me in
the bag when my name wasn’t
mentioned before,” said Cham-
bers. .

His explanation didn’t sound
quite right to me, but it gave me
a chance to play. Thompson told
me he was sure that I had what
it takes to make the Majors. How-
ever, they probably tell every-
body that, that they try to sign,”
Chambers. .

Chambers’ hitting record of
less than .150 two seasons ago
harmed his draft chances. In his
eyes though his .333 average this
year more than atoned for his
poorer years.

“Because of the season before

  
  

    

every scout that came up to me
wouldask, ‘Can you hit a curve
ball?’ They all felt I just would-
n’t be able to hit major league
pitching,” said Chambers.

“I know I can catch in the
Majors now, but I don't think I
can hit right now. It’s going to
take several years for that. I’m
running out of time though.
They’re likely to give the chance
to an 18-year-old, because he has
more time to spend in the min-
ors. But as long as I have a
chance I intend to play. Unfor-
tunately they will have more of
a say than I will,” said Cham-
bers.

Mazurek-..Weighs
Pro Sports Jobs

Fred Mazurek remains unde-
cided upon his future in profes-

' sional athletics. He currently has

offers from the Minnesota Twins
baseball team and Washington
Redskins professional f o o t b all

‘Players’ Excel in ‘Miser’ Production

By ANDY SOLOMON

The play was in the old
style, a romantic farce that
had father, brother and sis-
ter long lost and united in
one coincidental and senti-
mental scene. Moliere’s The

Miser, however, was a de-
light. A 17th century play,
but not antiquated, perform-
ed by non-professionals, but not
amateurish, Harpagon (The Mis-
er) and his associates truly lived
as portrayed‘ by the University

Theatre.

nus YEAR'S
ACADEMY AWARD WINNER!

Harpagon was guilty of two
weaknesses; his vanity came sec-
ond only to his love of money.
From these two characteristics
the plot arose. Because of his
greed, he tried to marry off his
daughter without providing a
dowry; because of his vanity, he
competed for his son’s love, Mari-
ane.

Neither his daughter disobedi-
ence when she married a young
noble, Valere, who had been pos-
ing as a steward, nor his son’s
victory in winning Mariane hurt
him as much as when he lost his
money box. With his treasure re-
turned, Harpagon’s life was once
more meaningful.

Between its beginning and
“pat” but happy ending, the play
is sparked with wit, excellent
pantomime and hilarious char-
acterizations. In addition, because
of the compactness of Stephen
Foster Memorial Auditorium,
none of the clever actions and
facial expressions of the players
were needlessly lost.

Dan Freeza in the role of Har-
pagon gave an inspired perform-
ance. There is nothing amateurish
in his feel for ludicrous comedy
of his part. Even if the rest of
the performances were mediocre,
which it is not, Frezza’s perform-
ance alone could make the play
enjoyable.

Of the other main characters,

rickson) and Cleante (Jim Ber-

lently. Miss Fredrickson is very
charming and more than does
justice to her role as a pretty,
young French lady. Though she
occassionally forgot to face the
audience while speaking in the
opening scene, she was generally
cfistinct and very likeable through-
out the play. 7‘

Jim Berry displayed T a'~ great
deal of talent in his part. John
Gallagher as Valere was at times
good, at times only adequate.
Only the portrayal of Mariane
(Marcia Godrich) left anything
to be desired.

The secondary characters: Fro-
sine (Glorianne Engel), Master
Jacques (A. Richard Coakley),
and La Fleche (Frank Maraden)
were excellent. All of them
proved very skillful in the slap-
stick and pantomime that kept
