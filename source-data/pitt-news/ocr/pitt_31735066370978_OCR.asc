Law dean’s report sheds light on budget dispute

By Michael Ashford
and Michelle Zollner

A detailed report on the law school,
written last year by Dean Richard
Pierce stated, “The university’s fund-
ing of the law school is so inadequate,
and the incremental assessment process
so unpredictable, that the law school
must be prepared at any time to use its
present modest giving funds to cover

costs like the school’s phone bills, the

salaries it pays  adjunct professors
or even the cost of buying enough
paper to get through the year.”

Heart—lung
transplant
successful

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

The youngest American ever to

undergo a heart and lung transplant is

listed in critical but stable condition at

the Intensive Care Unit of Children’s

Hospital.

* Kimberly Fuller, a 9-year-old girl
from Yukon, Okla., underwentgthe
surgery Wednesday which lasted for
five-and-a-half hours. «

Kimberly received the heart and
lungs of an unidentified donor, just
three weeksafter she had offered to
donate her organs to someone else if
a donor was not found for her, accord-
ing to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

A hospital spokesman said Kimber-
ly’s surgeons, Drs. Bartley Griffith,
Albert Trento and Robert Hardesty,
were pleased with the operation‘ and felt
that it went smoothly.

The first two days are crucial in
transplant operations, said a hospital
spokesman, because signs of rejection,
heart or lung failure are likely to oc-
cur during that time. The hospital
spokesman said the doctors feel
Kimberly is a fighter.

Yesterday, Kimberly was able to
recognize her parents, and for the ﬁrst
time, she saw that her ﬁngernails were
pink and not purple, according to the
spokesman. The purple color in her
fingernails was caused by the disease
Fibrosing Pulmonary Alveolitis.

In the future, the doctors are slowly
going to take Kimberly off of her
respirator, and within one to two
months, if all goes well, she will be
released.

The document, submitted to the Pro-
vost’s ofﬁce by Pierce when he as-
sumed ofﬁce in July 1984, sheds light
on the current dispute with the univer-
sity administration which led to
Pierce’s resignation.

Administration and law school of-
ficials, however, refuse to confirm the
rumor that Pierce resigned because the
university failed to fulfill promises of
increased financial support for the law
school. But Professor Seeburger did
say that Pierce took office with an air
of “expectations and general
assurances over his plan.”

“There was no promise of overnight

change,” Seeburger said. “However,
[Pierce] was led to believe there would
be changes in the near future.”

Pierce’s report, which has apparently
become the focus of a deluge of
meetings between the Provost’s office
and the law school faculty steering
committee, identiﬁed three priority
needs of the school. According to the
report, if financial support is not in-
creased for the law school library,
faculty salaries and general student and
faculty scholarship, the school’s grow-
ing success could be halted.

Pierce contends in his report that
even non—personnel costs of the law

school, which include funds for library
acquisitions, cannot be met. “Even
with restrictions on faculty access to
support of this type being far more
serious than those imposed on com-
parable law schools, the school has

_consistently overspent its budget for

supplies, equipment, etc., by over
$50,000 per year.

“The Pitt law school is ranked 20th
among the nations’ 176 law schools in
terms of both quantity and quality of
faculty and scholarly publications,” he
said. But according to Pierce’s report,
“faculty salaries rank 58th in the coun-
try.  Its [Pitt’s] tuition for both in-

state and out-of-state students is far
above the tuition charged by any other
state school” and “the university’s
level of funding for law library acquisi-
tions ranks 176th of I76’’ law
schools in the nation.

One -key component of Pierce’s
report is his proposed alternative to the
university’s current “centralized, in-
cremented budgetary decision-
making” process. Pierce contends that
this top—down process “provides
powerful incentives for responsibility
centers to resort to gamesmanship and
strategic behavior in their relationships

Tomorrow the Pitt Panthers will try to run over Penn State’s Nittany Lions and spoil their perfect record.

Students plan rally to protest apartheid

By Kathy Stahl
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Students For a Free South
Africa and Penn Staters Against Apart-
heid are planning a rally against apart-
theid Saturday before the Panther-
Nittany Lion football game.

The rally will begin at 6:30 p.m. in
front of the Public Health building.

The idea of joining Pitt and Penn

State students together began when
Doug Howell, an undergraduate stu-
dent at Pitt, and a member of Students
for a Free South Africa, had a chance
meeting with Bob Allen, a member of
Penn Staters Against Apartheid,
Howell said. They decided, along with
the Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,
that it would be interesting to have a
uniform rally.

‘By John Zaphyr
Assistant News Editor

Face painting will return to the Pitt
campus just in time for the Pitt-Penn
State football game tomorrow night.
The event is sponsored by the
Freshman Council. '

‘‘It should work,” , said Bonnie
Silipigni, the public relations chairman
for Pitt’s Freshman Council.
‘ ‘Everyone’s so dead since the Panthers
have been losing, and we just need to
get them psyched.”

Pitt fans

paint their

Last year, more than 9,000 students
participated in the painting ritual before
the Panthers’ loss to Oklahoma 42-0.
The painting supplies 'for that game
were provided by Generik Ink, Inc., a
company that produces body paints for
Halloween, as part of an effort to break
a record for the number of painted
students appearing at one game. This
year, the effort is strictly to promote
student spirit for the game.

“We’re trying to promote spirit,”
said Silipigni. “Since it’s a big game,

faces

we're trying to make it bigger.”

The painting will run from 4 p.m. to
7 p.m. tomorrow and will be held in
the Towers Lobby, the Towers
Cafeteria, the gates to sections 6, 7 and
8 at Pitt Stadium and at some frater-
nities. Figures of helmets, paws and
panthers painted in either blue or gold
colors will be offered to participating
faces.

‘ ‘When I get my face painted, ” said
SGB president Luke Kluchko, “I’ll go
for the paws.”

 

 

“While Pitt and Penn State are
meeting to beat the shit out of each
other, we’re pulling together the two
schools in a common effort of help for
South Africa,” said Howell.

This is not the first time that Pitt and
Penn State students are taking action
against apartheid, however. Pitt held
an anti-apartheid rally on Oct. ll, in
conjunction with National Anti-
apartheid Protest Day, which was en-
dorsed by the United Nations. At Penn
State, who also invests in companies
doing business .in South Africa,
students held their own special events
on Protest Day.

“I’m still not satisﬁed with Pitt’s
standing on selective divestment,”
Howell said. “It has become grossly
and morally insufficient.” ,

According to Chuck Pascal, co-
chairman of the Pitt Divestment Cam-
paign, Pitt has $37 million invested in
companies doing business in South
Africa. _

“How can we morally allow our
university to invest in companies that

 -1. .-~ .

 

  

‘carry on employment practices in South

Africa that we would ‘consider illegal
and indignant here in the United
States?” said Howell.

Executive Vice , President Jack
Freeman said last August that “the
university supports the desirability of
a strong American presence in South
Africa.”

Howell questions many of the
board’s statements. Last May 14, at a
board of trustees meeting, Pitt ofﬁcials
spoke of involvement in a program
which would provide scholarships for
young black employees in South Africa
to attend Pitt. “So far Ihaven’t heard

or seen anything to follow this up,”

said Howell. Pitt officials were
unavailable I for comment.

“The board must ask themselves if
the loss of return on their investment

is tolerable enough compared to the dif- ' ‘

ference they could make,” said
Howell.
South Africa believe that total divest-
ment is an unmistakably positive stand
for morality over money.”

with the university."

The “responsibility centers” are
those administrative units in the law
school which produce budget requests.
Pierce had intended to decentralize this
process to increase the school’s
cost-efficiency.

Pierce adds that “many alumni also
believe, whether correctly or not, that
the university’s present method of
budgeting exposes their gifts to the law
school to the risk of indirect realloca-
tion to other parts of the university.”

Rumors that the university was ap-
propriating alumni funds could not be
confirmed. But Pierce adds that “this
widespread perception among alumni
dampens their enthusiasm for giving
money to the law school.”

Pierce contends in the report that
under his proposed changes “the
university and each school would be
able to assure [with credibility] alum-

'ni that every dollar they give will be

used for the purpose they intend."
The report outlines other effects of
underfunding. “Tuition level is the
only respect in which Pittsburgh's
budget has even approached that of a
top-20 law school,” Pierce writes, add-
ing that “all of the schools whose tui-
tion is comparable to Pittsburgh’s tui-
tion have resources provided by their

universities far in excess of those '

available to. Pittsburgh.’ "

In the report, Pierce points out that
ﬁnancial aid programs are conven-
tionally used to offset tuition costs in
recruiting high-quality students. But he

by Berke B1-eathed

writes, “Over the past seven years the
law schools out-of-state tuition has in-
creased 99 percent and its in-state tui-
tion has increased 112.5 percent, while
its ﬁnancial aid budget has remained
at the same level.”

Pierce notes in the report that “the

combination of high tuition and low '

financial aid has its most devastating
impact on the school’s efforts to im-
prove the racial diversity of its student
body.” And in an effort to increase the
law school student body’s minority
enrollment as well as overall quality
and diversity, Pierce suggests ﬁnancial
aid be directed toward out-of-state ap-
plicants whenever possible, because
most minority applicants are out of
state and because tuition revenue losses
would be minimized. " I

Free Press

In an article that appeared in the Nov. 18
edition of The Minuteman, Robert Morris Col-
1ege’s student newspaper, Editor Amy Alberti
reported that college President Charles L.
Sewall is not a graduate of Harvard University
as was previously claimed in a number of the
college’s publications. These include the
Robert Morris sports media guide and the
1977 college publication commemorating
Sewall’s 10th year as Robert Morris’

president.

Alberti should be congratulated not only for
the courage she displayed in printing the story
but for her triumph in investigative reporting

as well.

Dean of Students Jack Balderson, on the
other hand, suddenly ﬁnds himself in an unen-
viable position. Accusations have been made
that Balderson conﬁscated the newspapers
before they were circulated, and also attempt-
ed to have them banned from the college
library, before returning them late Monday
afternoon. If this is so, Dean Balderson should
be ashamed of himself.

It is no secret that freedom of the press is
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The kind
of action that Dean Balderson was alleged to

have perpetrated

is a blatant violation of this

constitutional right. In our book, the U.S.
Constitution is sacrosanct. Flagrant violation
of its principles should not go without

reprimand.

Was Will Gay?

I must take umbridge with the col-
umn “Homosexuality: Biological
perspective and its ramiﬁcations” by
Trent Curtis and Chris Biancheria.

William Shakespeare was not a_

homosexual. There have been a lot of
good, even great artists who were
homosexuals —- BUT William
Shakespeare is not one of them.

All of the factual knowledge that we
have of Shakespeare’s existence has
been taken from ofﬁcial documents.
These include such things as baptismal
certiﬁcates, obituary notices, wills,
burial vouchers, conveyances and
receipts for payments to the court. The
only other knowledge we have are
some allusions to him by his
contemporaries. /

He was married at age 18, and he
fathered three children. These are facts.
In lieu of external evidence, Curtis and
Biancheria have chosen to extrapolate,
labeling their theory as a fact — that
is not cricket. I’ve got a sneaking
suspicion that their basis is some of
“The Sonnets” (numbers 18 to 126).
This rather immature effort to bend the
“internal" evidence to their particular
bias is a disgrace.

Shakespeare was a writer who could
master any aspect of language —— our
language —- and make it speak for any
human situation. The story of “The
Sonnets” is an artistic invention. The
relationships between the “characters”
is so obscure and so cryptic that they
achieve impersonality. This is good.
This was what Shakespeare’s lifelong
devotion was to — impersonality of
consummate artist.

For Curtis and Biancheria to so
cavalierly invoke the name of the
world’s greatest writer as part of their
“abracadabra” to the non-homosexual
for more acceptance and understanding
is absurd. It is also very irresponsible
and not very intelligent. Considering
that they dealt with Greek civilization
in one sentence, and I quote:
“Homosexuality was very normal and
accepted in ancient Greece," I can only
conclude that not only do Curtis and
Biancheria think in images, they can’t
even be superﬁcial alone.

Tasteless

Congratulations [to] The Pitt News,
you’ve once again managed to display
to the world how offensive and tasteless
you are. I am referring to the cartoon
by Wallace that graced your Nov. 20
opinions page. Mr. Wallace, why don‘t
you go for the big bucks and submit
your work to Hustler? While cartoons
in that magazine are tasteless and

Letters

satirical, yours is just tasteless. I ﬁnd
your use of the imagery of the garbage
can and coat hanger stunning. But if
you are trying to equate (or perhaps,
taint?) all abortion with the clandestine
and repulsive abortions that were con-
ducted on women in this country for
so long, why not get a little more ex-
plicit? And your cute little rhyme! So
subtle, so jolly. I certainly appreciated
your position with a new insight.
It’s about time that the anti-
abortionists (oh, excuse me, “pro-life
advocates ’ ’) realize that it is wrong to
try and use guilt as a weapon every

CB For Dean

One of my more creative profes-
sional activities this past summer has
been the acquisition of an adorable
white female kitten, whom we have
named CB (for Cotton Ball). Now that
I have gotten to know CB and have
become aware of her many executive
talents, I’ve decided that she would be
an outstanding candidate for Dean of
Engineering.

Silly, you say? A pussy cat for dean?
Well, just let me tell you why that isn’t
so.
First, CB is very affable. She keeps
her opinions to herself and does not
offend anyone. People respect her.

CB is honest and straightforward.
She never says anything that isn’t true,
and she has a talent for telling people
exactly what they want to hear (meow!)

CB is a committed scholar. She de-
vours books and journals. Only last
week she ate 17 pages of manuscript
from my latest Schaum’s Outline. And
she likes to chew on ﬂoppy disks — CB
is not intimidated by new technology.

CB’s attention span is about 10
seconds, and she has a proclivity for
running around in circles chasing her
own tail. Clearly, she would fit right
into the university administrative
environment.

CB bathes regularly and is complete-
ly litter-trained. She would not use the
classrooms, elevators or stairwells in
Benedum Hall for anything other than
their intended purposes. Thus she
would be a perfect role model for
others in the building, some of whom
are less fastidious in their personal
habits.

CB travels extensively, but she never
charges anything to the hard-money
budget. Sometimes she disappears for
extended periods and no one knows
where she is, though she always
manages to show up when someone
needs her. That’s more than you can
say for some of her potential

to the Editor

colleagues.

And she is a female, which should
please the afﬁrmative action folks, even
if she is the wrong color.

Now, those of you who have been
around the university for a while, how
many administrators do you know’ who
have all these ﬁne qualities?

Panther Pride

When the gladiators enter the arena
which so proudly overlooks our
historic school, there will be a roar
which will be heard from miles around.
The records and rankings will turn to
dust, ﬁre will ﬁll our hearts; One must
remember, though, a victory for us
means nothing, but for you riches and
rewards. This, you see, is what makes
it all worth the effort — stealing from
you that which you cherish. For those
of you who remember 1981, I need say
no more. Revenge is such a harsh

word, but one that is oh-so-ﬁtting for

such an occasion. A friendly warning,
however, from those of us who have
already suffered the pain — sorrow and
pain will be great, but remember that
time shall heal all wounds.

The last two sentences of the letter

Qu€_StiQt1i_n_g The Bull: Capital Turns To Un

In the past three weeks the Dow
Jones Industrial Average has surged
ahead by 78 points. There are many
reasons that account for the rising
bullish sentiment. For example, the
decline in interest rates, especially the
real estate rates in the bond market,
make stocks a more attractive invest-
ment. Another frequently citedreason
is the continued buoyancy of the
economy, as the Gross National Prod-
uct grew at an annual rate of 3.3 per-
cent during the third quarter following
a ﬂat ﬁrst half.

Nevertheless, a more rigorous
analysis must begin by noting the ex-
pansion of industrial capacity. As late
as the ﬁnal quarter of 1983, produc-
tive capacity was rising at only 1.8 per-

cent annually. This is Barely over half
of the latest rate of 3.4 percent during
the second quarter of this year. Yet, the
capacity utilization rates have been in
a downward spiral for six months.
Consequently, it is unproﬁtable to keep
expanding capacity. The current rise in
the stock market corresponds to the
decline in spending on new plants and
equipment. -

A related phenomenon is corpora-
tions buying back their own stock. This
is commonly done to outﬂank and pre-
vent takeoveribids. Stock repurchases
serve to raise the price of the shares,
thus distributing some of the beneﬁts
to stockholders. But, at the same time
it is an admission that- more proﬁtable
investment outlets do not exist.

Mergers and corporate buybacks in the
last six quarters have accounted for
nearly 70 percent of the price advance
in" Standard & Poor’s 500.’ Nor does-
there appear to be an abatement in the
pace of takeovers and repurchases. Last
week Ford announced it would pur-
chase 20 million of its own shares for
about $1 billion. Similarly, Beatrice
agreed to accept $6.2 billion from a
company that would make it private.
If these transactions occur, shares of
Ford and Beatrice will disappear from
the market. Since the beginning of
1984, $150 billion‘ has been drained
from the equity markets. _This
represents roughly 13 percent of the
$1.2 trillion market value of Standard
& Poor’s 500. Since stockholders are
likely to reinvest the money in the

market, these activities result in more
money chasing fewer shares.
Corporations have gone heavily in-
to debt to repurchase their shares and
to buy other companies. These acts
create no new wealth but merely
transfer ownership and swap equity for
massive amounts of debt. This serves

' to heighten the risk in the system by

leveraging already weak -balance
sheets.‘ In 1984 corporate debt as a
whole rose to a staggering 75 percent
of gross proﬁts.

The corporate restructuring that
mergers and buybacks imply is a
spurious and parasitic form of ac-
cumulation from the standpoint of
society as a whole, since it is not essen-
tial to costs of production. Supply-
siders would have us believe that a lack

. - V - . '
productive Uses
of produetion investment is caused by I
' insufﬁcient capital, proﬁts and savings.

The analysis herein suggests that the
problem is not that of generation of
capital but its absorption. Mergers and
buybacks are symptomatic of an
economy plagued with excess capaci-

ty. The lack of , sufﬁciently proﬁtable :

outlets turns capital to unproductive
uses.

The need for a proﬁt forces capital
to withdraw from productive uses if the
return is not sufﬁcient. This is not fun-
damentally different from workers
striking when wages are not sufﬁcient.
A capital strike is as ruinous to the
economy as a labor strike, and more
so if measured in terms of its
multiplier, or ripple effect on the
economy as a whole.

East—West Cpiiﬂict Goes Deeper Than The Merely Ideological

WASHINGTON '— The day started
with a reading of the papers and the
daily search for a column topic. There
was much to choose from, lots of tru-
ly importantevents like the Geneva
summit, andless cosmic stories like the
suit brought by Rock Hudso_n’s self-

‘ proclaimed last lover. Iread‘ it all, took '
notes ,5 made some phone calls and then; ‘
satisﬁed with the cornucopia of topics.
facing. me, I’ set off for lunch. That's _

when I saw her.- , . 
First I. noticed people staring in the
direction of the Soviet’ Embassy. When

I got closer, I saw a camera; crew and.‘

then, across the street, three people sit-

ting, on chairs before an office building. '

The person in the middle was Avital
Scharansky... ‘ ‘ ~ .‘_ ’ i
It had been years since I had seen her

last, but she-seemed no different —— a_

face constantly updated. by newspaper.
photos and television news and
therefore, like family, too familiar for‘

me to notice any change. Her head was

_ covered in the style of ultra-Orthodox

Jewish women, no hair showing, and
her dress was extremely modest and

_ plain. For all of that, she is the ﬁercest

of accusers, a ﬁnger pointing always
at a Soviet government that holds her

husband, Anatoly, in a labor camp. On ,

the most‘ glorious of Indian; summer

. days, she was. a reminder that ‘winter
had come once again t0fSib_eria.
Often there is a demonstration before i

the Soviet Embassy. Often, the reason
is the refusal of the Soviet‘ government
to allow Jews to‘ emigrate, Sometimes

frabbis come to pray" and _'soi;‘ietimes

people just come to pray and sometimes

people just come to stand on the street ‘

and stare at the embassy, which is old,
and crusty and}‘a1l~ shut up like a closed
mind’. You may ‘wonder if the people

inside pay any: heed. There is no way ‘
i to tell for sure, but I think they do.

Once I was in the South African Em-

bassy waiting in the ‘foyer for a visa,
when ﬁve demonstrators came to pro-
test apartheid. They rang the bell and
stared straight at the mirrored door, not
knowing they could be seen — and

' heard -— through it. They were nervous

about being. arrested and so they giggled
and made weak jokes‘ and then the

’ police came to take them away. They
linked arms and sang “We Shall Over-

come,’’’ and all the time some people
inside the Embassy watched-, listened

. and, of course, ‘said nothing to one
- another. The demonstrators thought no

one was watching, but someone was.
- I crossed 16th Street, -hesitated" for

a moment and then walked over" to.
Avital Scharansky; I introduced‘ myself '

because it has been a long time since‘
we last met; “I think of you a lot," I
said. ‘I do, because she is often in the
news, showing up at’ major events to‘

. remind the world that her husband re-

mains imprisoned in the Soviet Union

for the crime of being a Jewish dissi-
dent. She was in Paris when Mikhail
Gorbachev came for his ofﬁcial visit;
she was in New Yorkfor the 40th an-
niversary of the United Nations. Like
hope itself, "she is everywhere.

' It‘ would be wonderfui to concentrate
only on the grand problems of the East-
West conﬂict —- arms reduction", Star

‘Wars —’as if the differences between

the Soviets and’ us were" only
ideological and, in terms of any real’
conflict, exclusively prospective. But
Avital Scharansky always bring us
down to the small, the human and the
immediate — to the plight of her hus-
band,- his 13-year sentence on the
preposterous charge of being an

American spy," his” suffering, his-

headaches, his worsening health, his
very existence in a Siberian labor camp
near the city of Perm. She will not let
him die and she will not let us forget.

And by extension she reminds us of

the plight of all the others the Soviets
have jailed for what the West calls
“crimes of conscience. ” They include:
Ukrainian nationalists like Vasyl Stus,
who died in a labor camp; Russian Or-
thodox Christians like Boris Razveyev;
Lutherans; Baptists; atheists with the
wrong politics; and Jews who, unlike
Scharansky, have no politics, not even
dissent, but whose crime is their ﬁerce
determination to teach Hebrew to their
children‘. Scharansky is only the best
known of the jailed. His isthe univer-
sal face of the victim.

Avital Scharansky’ smiled at my ‘

greeting and‘ nodded in recollection of

' our last meeting and then, not know-.

ing what to say, I stupidly blurted out,
“Keep up the good work,”- which of
course she will. So I quickly said good-
bye and headed off for my lunch. There
had been so much to write and then,
suddenly, there had been only one thing
_to write: Let him go. Let them all go.

V «Teach- in being held Monday November 25. Further details forthcoming. Ioin with
these student leaders! ‘

We, the undersigned, condemn and express our moral outrage over the invitation
to Louis Farrakhan to speak on Pitt campus. While we are pleased that Louis Far-
rakhan toned down his Anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric for his Pitt appearance, this
in no way obscures the fact that he remains one of the most outspoken bigots in public
life in America today. Though we recognize the right of any individual to ex-
ercise his right to free speech and expression, we vigorously oppose, without
equivocation, . the bigotry which he represents and the efforts made to bring
this man to our campus. In order to heal the wounds caused by his appearance we
call upon all people of good faith to join us in this teach-in on Monday November
25th and sincerely hope that through this teach-in we can increase understanding on
the part of the University community.

While we recognize and support the free expression of ideas and speech, and
perhaps because of this, we must condemn those who seek to use this right to spread
bigotry and racism. We call upon the Black Action Society to apologize for bringing a
bigot of the stature of Louis Farrakhan to Pitt Campus.

Zachary Grayson, Iewish Law Students Against Farrakhan

In my opinion Louis Farrakhan is racist, Anti—Iewish, and Anti-Christian, yet
these are mere shortcomings compared to his advocacy _of establishing an apar-
theid State in America: an idea Whieh is abhorrent to all. It is apparent by the
actions of the Black Action Society that a radical fringe has taken control of the

organization and they can no longer be considered the legitimate voice of black ~ I as

~ students on campus.

Avery Abrams, SGB

In reaction to Farrakhan's speech, we are morally outraged with the Anti-
Christian, and racist remarks he made last Thursday night. It should be obvious

to all who listened toF arrakhan, that his attacks towards Iews and others were i A
unquestionably present and those who deny Such attacks are merely fooled by _ a
his rhetoric. It is highly unfortunate that those who are knowledgeable of Far-

rakhan's style and content, which he abuses in his message of hatred, have      

not yet spoken out. We agree with the high ideals that Farrakhan expressed a ,
regarding the growth of knowledge. It is however, highly ironic that this same a A a
man who warns of the dire effects of the abuse of knowledge is himself the
epitome of the deceitful and skillful liar. Therefore, we invite all people of good
faith to a platform against this man on Monday November 25 from 10:30 -l:30- I

Long before musical endeavors like
Live Aid and Farm Aid, Joe Grushecky
and his band the Iron City House-
rockers played a benefit concert in an
effort to lend a helping hand to the
unemployed steelworkers in the Pitts-
burgh area. Through that concert, the
Houserockers helped to establish the

United Steel Workers Local 1397 food
bank. It was then that Grushecky met
steel-union activist Mike Stout and told
him he’d be willing to work with him
again.

Last month marked the debut of
Grushecky’s new band, Joey G. and
the Brick Alley Band, as well as the
debut of a new song titled “Stand Up,”
co-written by Stout and Grushecky. At
a “wild” press conference/party, it was
also announced that the Tri-State Con-
ference on Steel would host a rock-n-
roll benefit concert on Friday, Nov. 22
at the Syria Mosque. Joey G. and the
Brick Alley Band will open for head-
liners John Cafferty and the Beaver

Though I’m not a Pitt student, I
feel obligated to reply to Jim Ur-I
ban’s column on heavy metal music
in the Nov. 15 issue. I’m afraid he
shows his youth and bias in some
of his statements and comparisons.

The basis of his argument,

equating heavy metal music to the
music of the ’60s, is not accurate.
The eariler musicians had wit and
talent and deserve to be
remembered and played. (lts cur-
rent fad popularity as “Baby
Boomer Music” will pass quickly, I
hope.) Only time will tell, of course,
how many heavy metal bands will
be remembered in 20 years. I ex-

pect very few, if any. Chances are .

radios will continue to play the ear-
ly classics — like Led Zeppelin and
Deep Purple — but will largely ig-
nore the late heavy classics such as
Kiss, Judas Priest or Flatt.

Mr. Urbans’ comment, “How
many times have we seen artists
from the pop, soul or country music
catagories  fizzle into the
twilight?” is sadly naive. How many
times indeed? That’s the nature of
the medium, as true for heavy metal
as any type of music. There are

. scores of heavy metal groups who

have “fizzled in the twilight.” Unfor-
tunately I forget their names. Only
the best survive. And although I
dislike Kiss and heavy metal, it’s
possible Kiss is a better group.
But is heavy metal memorable?
Should you even mention it in the
same article as Stevie Wonder? Not

ty). Kiss has one four-star record,
two three-star records and several
two- and one-star records. General-
ly medicore. Judas Priest has three
one-star records. Stevie Wonder
has five five-star records (must-own

After years of pretension, glamour and

r condescending confusion in popular

American music, there have finally, out
of the gutter, arisen musicians and
bands that are truly representative of
their own —- not pop — culture. The
rise of the independent label is in many
ways responsible for this. Through put-
ting down their own money and taking

rking class

their own risks, they have put artistic
license back into the hands of the art-
ists and remained competitive, even
critically acclaimed. They represent
r'ock’s new working class.

The informality, youthful ideal and
emotional power of rock have been
merged not with flash and big
business, but with basic values like

i honesty and integrity.

Before I get carried away, this is only
a record review, or, more specifically,
a review of two records: Tim , by Min-
neapolis’ Replacements, and Flip Your
Wig, by Minneapolis’ Husker Du. I use
them as examples primarily because
they are the two most dangerous
bands likely to break into the mass
comercial market. The Replacements,
who began with Twin Tone Records,
have already been picked up by Sire,
a major label in affilation with Warner
Bros. Husker Du, also, has been
rumored for some time to be
negotiating for the big time. While the
bands have dramatically different ap-
proaches to music, they share the abili-
ty to create music that is both so in-
tensely schizophrenic and undeniably
human that it’s scary. These are real
emotions that won’t so much give you
goose pimples as throw you into mood
swings. The songs are happy and sad,
in love, obnoxious, scared, lonely 
just like life. They return the immediacy
and punch to rock and establish it as
an important, volatile and uncom-
promising art form.

Tim brings the Replacements one

The placements 

step further into themselves. While it
doesn’t take itself too seriously, it does
clear some of the cloud of absurdity
which has blessed/cursed the band.
Tim, most of all, is a straightforward
rock n’roll record. it's what the Stones
could have done if they had ever
slowed down long enough to look at

‘themselves in the mirror.

Both sides of Tim start off on an
assertive note, with hard rockers like
“Lay It Down Clown” and “Bastards
of the Young,” and settle into tunes
that are more reserved, that send you
into the streets humming. “Kiss Me On
The Bus,” a sprawling, happy tune
and “Waitress in the Sky,” an amus-
ing indictment of flight attendants are

’ sure to grace commercial airwaves.

The record winds down to uncover
loneliness and pain, in the ‘biting love
story “A Little Mascara” and the down-

and-out ballad “Here Comes a "

 

Regular.” ‘

Flip Your Wig brings Husker Du
closer to commerciality and to creating
the soundtrack for the post-industrial
age. No doubt the Huskers have prov-

‘en they play straight rock‘n’ro|l with

“Makes No Sense at All” and soaring,
crystal-clear pieces “Green Eyes” with
the best ofthem, but they’ve also prov-
en that they don’t have to. What they
do do is create atmospheres andban-
thems so intense, and dramatic that

they can restore your faith in the sheer F

power that rockmusic can create. This
is what alienation sounds like. After a
tough day in the pits, put on side two
of Flip Your Wig and rest assured you
are not alone.

This is real music. |t’s bigger than
life and much bigger than the people
who make it, and that’s nice for a
change. ‘

POWER WINDOWS
Rush
Polygram Records

Rush is not a heavy metal ,band.
Anyone who believes so probably
hasn't heard their eleventh album in as
many years, Power Windows. Sure

 

there are some devastatingly

-thunderous power chords on the

album. But this band tempers the hard
edge with a tasteful use of syn-

5 thesizers and some of the catchiest

melodies they've come up with in a

, long time. The sound is more akin to
The Mahavishnu Orchestra than ’

Motley Crue. -

One thing Rush has been particular-I

ly successful at is creating songs with
a strong cinematic effect, such as
“Jacob’s Ladder” or “Red Barchetta”

.on past efforts. Power Windows in-

cludes a tour de force in ‘Manhattan

Project.” Instead of making petty
moralizations about the danger of
nuclear proliferation (for example,
“Russians” by Sting), “Manhattan
Project” is.a historic piece about the
ushering in of the Nuclear Age. With
the help of a 30-piece string section
and excellent use of dynamics, Rush
recreates a vivid account of the race
for the Ultimate Weapon during World.
War II.

Power Windows further develops the
style first presented on Signals, which
included songs centered around
keyboard melodies and propulsive
quasi-dance rhythms.

However, the songwriting on the"

new album is tighter and more effec-
tive than on any of their previous
albums. In addition, Geddy Lee
sounds less and less like a cross be-
tween Robert Plant and Donald Duck
and more like a serious vocalist. The
best results of the combination occur
in such songs as “Marathon,” with its
grandiose, spine-tingling, 25-piece
choir, “Territories,” featuring Neil
Peart in his bongo debut and “The Big
Money,” the latest singles release.
The big disappointment on the
album is the lack of any acoustical
guitar work by Alex Lifeson that has

graced previous albums. Prior works,-. . _._
such as The and Natural Science  
fared well  to the juxtapositiorj:_,»o'f.;.7.'-.'-

their evolution they display qualitiesjof
maturity and integrity in their
songwriting and playing uncommon to
artists who have been around twice as

   

long. The only question left is, after
eleven years of progressive change,
where can Rush go afterthis? Coun-

try music?

Josephine inspires the hearts

By Leslie Bennett

There are certain things a theater-
goer can expect when attending a Ci-
ty Theatre Company production: 1)
The play will be American, 2) it will be
contemporary, 3) it will be anything but
ordinary and 4) it will be good.

CTC strikes again with its current
production of Josephine: The Mouse
Singer, in which all the characters are
mice — complete with tails and ears
and oversized hunks of cheese.
Laughable though it may seem, Franz
Kafka, on whose short story the play
is based, used the characterizational
device to depersonalize and strip emo-
tional attachment from what is
ultimately a difficult and serious sub-
ject; art and man.

Jed Harris directs an unusually large V

cast of 11 in this compelling play,
which is insistent in raising questions
such as: What is the role of the artist,

_ what is his contribution to society and

what does society owe him in return for
that contribution?
insistent it is, but far from relentless.

,~
(_-‘I"V\P'9v
./-:1. 14- :« i_)

McClure’s language, at times poetic,
at others quite casual, adds moments
of mousey charm, and a light-hearted
comic relief to the play’s heavy
philosophical import. a
A big part of what CTC has going for
it is company member Kelly Maurer,
who leads the cast as Josephine, the

uncompromising and conscientious .

singer who demands in vain to be ex-
empt from labor in order to perfect her
art. The role is a fitting one for Maurer,
who, having appeared in every CTC
production in the past year along with
all three of last summer’s Shakespeare
Festival productions and being a facul-
ty member of Pitt’s theatre arts depart-

ment, must have the kind of drive and.

integrity that Josephine exhibits.
Maurer’s poised and passionate per-
formance here certainly gives no
reason to doubt it. ‘

William Cameron also gives a pleas-
ing performance as the narrator. While
filling the audience in on Josephine’s
conflict, he also adds insight to the
play’s real conflicts. Cameron’s por-

 

trayal lends the distinct impression that
while the narrator is an insider to the
situation he is also like us an outsider

Josephine (Kelly -Maurer)

V and hasn't any moresolutions than we ‘

do. -

neither does McClure allow‘ his au-

dience to become emotionally involved

 ,'_{i:_ 7'   

in his play. Even death and suicide are
treated ironically with an amusing
dance of death, and though the temp-
tation to laugh is often there, when we
finally do, it’s more like a nervous
giggle.

Bill Mott in the role of Baby, who
grows up too fast and falls in love with
Josephine, performs admirably as an
earnest but-misguided youth.

The remaining ensemble depicts
every side of the social coin, and if
some of the performances ‘seem
bland, they only serve to appropriate-
ly heighten the stature of Josephine.

What is important in Josephine is not
so much the substance of the play, but
rather the reaction and response it in-

A "spires in its audience. At least direc-

tor Harris apparently thinks so as, after

each performance, he gives the au-

dience an opportunity to discussthe
issues of the play as. well as the
aspects of the production. A _
All in all, CTC does a worthy job, as
usual, with this clever and provocative

play.

If only we were fuzzy little animals with 

By Lori Faiella

“Our youth is slipping away.” This
is one of Jimmy Porter’_s greatest fears.
in Look Back in Anger, the University
of Pittsburgh Studio Theatres’ latest
production, the characters
demonstrate how some people, unfor-
tunately, look back on their lives with
hate, disgust and anger.

in the play by John Osborne, four
characters, in their struggle for hap-
piness, get caught up in the deep-
rooted traumas of their past.

The performances takes place in the
Porters’ one room flat. The Porters are
Jimmy and Allison, a married couple
who, because of Jimmy’s demanding,
insensitive ranting and Allison’s meek,
defenseless nature, are, to say the
least, miserable. Their relationship is
strange. One moment he is verbally
brutalizing her as she cries and pleads
for him to stop, the next, they are hap-
py, talking of making love and playing
“squirrels and bears.” “Squirrels and
bears” is a game that they play to
escape reality, to avoid the cold, harsh
side of their life. They pretend they are
fuzzy little animals with simple
thoughts and uncomplicated lives, liv-
ing in the forest where they can love
without worry or guilt.

The two'of them are not alone; they
have a mutual friend, Cliff Lewis. Cliff
lives in their apartment building, but
spends most of his time in their flat.

the lives of the characters within it. He
is angry with life and it shows. He
criticizes all aspects of his life in some
way: his wife, her friend, his friend, his
treacherous past, the present and

most of his time either reading, argu-
ing with Jimmy or cuddling Allison. He
is the quiet, sincere friend who has
helped the Porters stay together for so
long. He is their shoulder to lean on.

   

The fourth character is Helena
Charles (Tammy Bouaos), Allison’s
best friend who decides to prolong a
temporary visit. Originally she came to
visit with Allison, to help her with her
problems, her pregnancy and her rela-
tionship with Jimmy. All of this
changes when Helena — secretly in
love with Jimmy,'who appears to
despise her entirely — sends Allison
home to her mother, which leaves
Helena alone with Jimmy and Cliff.

Toward the end of the play the
drama builds; Allison loses herbaby,
a close friend of Jimmy’s dies, Cliff
decides to leave and find whatever it
is he is looking for and Helena -
realizing it could never work between
Jimmy and her and amazed by
Allison’s understanding of what has

happened — ends her relationship ’

with Jimmy and goes back to the
theater. '

Look Back in Anger is a moving,
somewhat frightening play. What hap-
pens here could happen in real life. it

is a very humanistic play which il-. '

lustrates many aspects of life: love,
hate, death and deceit. It is almost like
a soap opera with the twisting love af-
fair that eventually brings the Porters
back together. It does differ from a
soap opera, however, in that the acting
is vivid and intense, and one feels as
if they are actually there, in the one-
room Midland flat, back in 1959.
Directed by Connie Canaday
Howard, Look Back in‘Anger effectively
proves its point. We all want to escape.

Sting: behind the man, the band andthe baby

By John Young

Early in Bring on the Night, Sting ex-
plains that he feels pop music is dead,
killed by its racist and reactionary
nature. He created a band with black
musicians to challenge those ideas,
and it serves as the background for
this film, which follows the group
through rehearsals to their tour-
opening concert in Paris.

Bassist Daryl Jones’ question of
whether the group of musicians Sting
brought together really constitutes a
band surfaces quickly. The idea that
the members of the group simply inter-
pret Sting’s material and don’t work on
an equal basis with him has merit.
Sting leads every aspect of the re-
hearsals, and in an interview, Sting’s
manager explained how he informed
the band that the money on the table
was Sting’s, and their portion would
obviously be less than his. Butvthe
issue was subsequently dropped and
appeared to cause no tension within
the band. '

Whether or not the band members
have equal say, their various contribu-
tions culminate in the centerpiece of
Bring on the Night — the music. The
rehearsal footage shows Sting and his
band fine tuning musical arrange-
ments, playing through material ex-
citedly and jokingly doing songs like
the theme from the “Flintstones.” In
between practice scenes, interviews
with the individual group members cut
in. In one of them, Sting says he
wanted to have a film made about a
band’s creation, and the diverse per-
sonalities in his group make the fulfill-
ment of his cinematic wish entertain-
ing. Two hilarious interviews — Bran-
ford Marsalis relating how he caught
Sting off guard by complimentarily call-
ing his music a “Motherf--ker” and
Daryl Jones telling everyone at the
dinner table his hopes of eventually be-
coming a Las Vegas headliner and
then proceeding to sing “New York,
New York” — add greatly to the film.
Many of these short commentaries of-
fer worthwhile insights, and the movie
surely could have benefited from the

‘ inclusion of more footage explaining

how the songs were worked up and ex-

I ploring personalities more deeply.

After scenes of Sting and his band
being photographed and some spec-

ulation about what this first concert_

meant to Sting’s subsequent success
outside The Police, the Paris %how
finally began.

The music during the concert
sounded exceptional. A scorching ver-
sion of “I Burn For You,” a dynamic
“Fortress Around Your Heart” and in-
spired rock-ups of the bluesy classics
“I Been Down So Long” and “Need
Your Love So Bad” worked especial-
Iy well. Cut-aways to Sting’s initial work

on songs like “Children’s Crusade”

and “We Work the Black Seam”

segue into fiery concert renditions of
his pieces.

In its coverage of the concert, Bring
on the Night forged a distance between
the band and the audience, leaving the
crowd silent until the conclusions of
songs. Sting’s performance of
“Message In A Bottle” alone on stage
epitomized the line No one here but
me-oh; when the audience joins in to
sing Sendin’ outran 808 at its conclu-
sion, their voices are a welcome
addition.

The film’s worst moment occurred

when the concert footage was inter-
rupted‘ to show Trudie Styler giving
birth to Sting’s child, accompanied by

“Russians.” The scene had emotion,
showing Sting’s visible joy at the
baby's birth, but I question what place
it had in a movie about a band and how
justifiable the song is linked to the
birth.

- When interviewed, one of Sting’s
backing vocalists said she felt Sting’s
songs represent an ideal combination
of “cerebral and viceraI” elements.
Unlike many critics who hailed The

 

Dream Of The Blue Turtles’ rnusical
achievements and rapped Sting for the
serious social commentary in his lyrics,
I agree with her assessment. Bring on

the Night certainly showcased the __ i

power and intelligence of Sting’s latest
material. If, in addition, the film could
have featured more studies of the peo-
ple behind the music, it could have
been truly outstanding. As it stands,
Bring on the Night offers insight into
the musical workings of Sting and his
band and the group’s exceptional per-
formances of Sting’s songs.

street-wise persona reads more like a
naive suburban hick in the city than an
aware young urbanite. Krush Groove
barely pretends to be realistic; and as
such, it is a showcase for rappers and
not actors.

Musically, the film did generate
some energy in the audience; but con-
ceptually, it never deviates from its
mindless plot enough to emphasize
the evolution of rap. Rap as a musical
genre has been growing for years in
Washington, D.C., and even gave
Blondie a No. 1 hit with “Rapture.” If
Krush Groove had accurately detailed
rap’s roots and gave the artists a
background and identity, it could have
become a documentation of rap’s
representation of social problematics.
Instead, Krush Groove is a horrendous

Rock ‘n’ roll benefit

fortunately: WDVE is the only Pitts-

_ burgh radio which plays the single
“Stand Up,’v’ which comes as a sur-
prise to Grushecky.

“This is a special project for me,”
Grushecky says. ‘‘I was influenced by
the scene at the food bank. People
were almost like beggars. It was real
sad.” He called on John Cafferty, an
old friend from the Houserocker days, '
because he felt none of the Pittsburgh
bands had enough pulling power to
‘give the cause the" attention it
deserved.

As a result, John Cafferty (whose
father was a steelworker) will take a
break from a national tour to headline
the concert. The choice of rock music
to deliver Tri-State’s message seemed
appropriate because “those experi-
encing thevbrunt of the first round of
layoffs are younger men and women
who listen primarily to ro_ck stations
and buy rock albums.”

r Grushecky says Cafferty has made
a major effort to perform. Both bands

continued from page 7 1
said the group expects to raise some
$30,000 for area steelworkers from

of the new single “Stand Up.”

Crimson flames and dusty rain
that used to blacken the dawn, -
Closed doors, empty stores

on the banks of the Mon.

Broken dreams, abandoned terrain,
silent machines, rusted remains,
Salt of the earth, where is your pride,
and where is the work we need to

survive.

Joey G. and Brick Alley Band
co-written by Mike Stout

“Victory” is the flip side to “Stand
Up” and both were produced by the
United Steel Workers of America
(along with Art Nardini). Both songs
describe the plight of unemployed
_stee|workers with the sensitive lyricism
Grushecky has used in the past. Un-

are donating their services for the con-
cert. Technicians and stagehands will
also contribute their services. John
Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band
really couldn’t have been a more suit-
able band to play the benefit. since
they’ve seen some hard times them-

selves. “We’re like a lot of bands,” «

Cafferty says, “in. that we worked real
hard for a real long time.”

Cafferty’s style, following the enor-
mous success with songs from the film
“Eddie and the Cruisers,” is epito-
mized with his latest album Tough All
Over which chronicles the struggles of
the working class. ‘‘In the past, I wrote
a lot offsongs about looking back,"
Cafferty explains. “But now I’m in my
earlythirties, it’s been a long time
since I was a surfer boy. I want to tell
a lot of stories that ring true to life.”

And _life in the steel towns has been
hard; the industry’s collapse is a
critical factor in the region's economy
which is one of the reasons Cafferty
and Grushecky got involved.

Grushecky describes the communities
in the Mon Valley as losing their
lifeblood. “lt’s _sad to see the places
now. They’re like ghost towns.”

Well they built all those factories I
with blood, sweat and steel.
They’re coming down fast,

under the weight of the wheel.
Hey little Johnny there ain’t no room

John Cafferty

The Tri-State Conference on Steel's
long range goal is “to move beyond
the localized effort in the Mon Valley
and develop a project that impacts on

the industrial revitalization of the en- ’

tire region.” The rock-n-roll benefit will

hopefully raise enough money to ‘save _

the Dorothy Six blast furnace in
Homestead. Mike Stout believes
money from “Stand Up" ‘should also.

help. “The best medium for me is rock- I

n-roll," he said. He considers Joey G.

By George Kresak

Have you an unconquerable desire
to pry into the personal lives of others?
Are you aroused by gossip, scandal
and intrigue? Is there nothing you find
more gratifying than smearing the
good reputation of your fellow? If so,
then by all means read on.

Some of Hollywood’s most notewor-
thy celebrities were on hand last Fri-
day night at Graffiti to roll out the red
carpet in honor of The Red Hot Chili
Peppers. Sylvester Stallone and his
new lady-love, Brigitte Nielsen, were
among the first of a long procession of
gilded stars and starlets to appear on
the scene. Emerging from his private
limousine, the Sly one affably mugged
for photographers, whence, spotting
several youngsters arguing Marxian
precepts curbside, he blithely moved
to subdue the god-forsaken, misguid-
ed free thinkers and, thereby, pre-empt
what he referred to as “their subver-
sive, communist p|ot.”

God bless America!

The loveable lunk later told reporters
with stern-faced honesty that, “I’m on-
ly here doing research for my next
Rambo flick in which I'll join forces with
the Parent’s Music Resource Center to
do battle with the evil, corrupting in-

Gossip, scandal

fluence of rock ‘n’ roll.’’

Twisted Sister, beware!

A glittering hoard of lusty celebrities
quickly assembled inside as Pitts-
burgh’s own “The Spuds” energetical-
ly displayed their mediocrity and lack

of taste. As with all activities engaged

in by thebustling Hollywood set, the
mingling was intense, aggressive and
fierce. Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran,

looking dashing in his topcoat and
French beret, whisked onto the
dancefloor, a box of assorted animal
crackers in hand, promising, “five

years of age, but is sporting a Ben-
neton sweater as well.”

a full seven minutes, a successive ex-
change of sustained, meaningful “*=«
glances served as the prelude to the
mutual seduction of Burt Reynolds and
Joan Collins. Emerging from some out-
of-the-way back room, the rumpled,
sultry Collins had this to say: “At my
age, darling, it’s critical to remain sex-
ually active, lest you wind up doing dog-
food commercials or proofreading
manuals for off-road recreational
vehicles.’’

Fates worse than death!

Throughout the night, Meryl Streep” ‘
remained aloof from the social hub-
bub, standing alone at the back bar,
gulping down numerous scotch and
sodas. At one point, she told the
bartender, “lt’s my intent to stand idly
by as the fundamentalist right forces
America’s children to drink cranberry
juice while watching incessant reruns
of The Brady Bunch, Gilligan’s Island
and The Flintstones.” As the night
wore on, Meryl, becoming maudlin,
tears rising to her bleary eyes, con-
fessed, “The depletion of the national 
reserve is far beyond my capabilities.” I

Pity, what?

Oh, yes! And what of The Red Hot
Chili Peppers, you ask? Well, they

and the Brick Alley Band as “the
number one rock-n-roll band that has
stood up for the workers.”

Joe Grushecky was given artistic
freedom from Stout for the song
“Stand Up” and altered its style to be
more in sync with the Brick Alley
Band’s blue-collar sound. Grushecky
admits the new band will cover some
of the old Houserocker tunes, but will
play mostlygnewer songs like “Radio
Ears,” “Restless Kind” and “Goodbye
SteeItown.” 5

In fact, “Goodbye Stee|town” was I
recently hailed by rock critic and
author Dave Marsh as part of “the real
folk music of the ’80s.” Many have
called the song depressing, but
Grushecky defends his song. ‘‘I think
it’s probably one of the truest songs
I've ever written. People have said 
‘Hey, ‘why did you write such a 1
depressing song?’ To me, this ain’t
depressing if you think the truth is
depressing. It’s not meant to be
depressing.”

Grushecky would like to see Pitt
students out in support of the
steelworkers and to realize what
they’re fighting for. “The-Pitt people
should be involved in what’s going on
in the community,” he says. “They
should be more aware of what’s hap-
pening and how bad things are. They
should be willing to stand up and get
involved.” It’s an important issue, yes,
and, in effect, a problem that perhaps
touches us all in some way. And, not
unlike in the past, there's something
to be said and the message is in the
music.

The rock-n-roll benefit begins at 7:30  
on Nov. 22, tickets are $10 and are i
available at National Record Mart and ‘
the Mosque box office. Copies of the
Joey G. and the Brick Alley Band

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

_ When Pitt lines up opposite the
top-ranked Penn State Nittany
Lions on Saturday, the success of
the Panthers will depend largely on
the play of one person, quarterback
John Congemi. Following Pitt’s
24-14 victory over North Carolina
State earlier in the season, Pitt
tailback Charles Gladman (who
rushed for 176 yards in that game)
said, “John Congemi is the key to
this offense. When Comgemi is on,
we win big.” Well, those thoughts
were echoed by a few noted
authorities on the game of football
yesterday.

“There is no doubt that John
Congemi is the key to Pitt’s chances
against Penn State,” Temple head
coach Bruce Arians said on Thurs-
day. “Pitt’s got a heckuva football
team. They can line up physically
against Penn State; they just have
to eliminate some of the penalties
and mistakes.”

Arians has had the pleasure of
facing both squads this year, unsuc-
cessfully. His squad dropped a
27-25 squeaker to the Nittany Lions
at Happy Valley in the Owls’ se-
cond game of the season, then got
edged, 21-17, two weeks ago at
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia
by Pitt. He is a huge supporter of
Congemi and makes no effort to
hide it.

“I’ve been a big fan of John Con-
gemi for a long time,” Arians said.
“He has played well in the past
against Penn State, and he is going
to have to have a big game on
Saturday night for Pitt to win.”

Boston College head coach Jack

‘Bicknell offered much the same

sentiments. “Well, I think you have
to show Penn State a varied attack.
You have to be able to throw, run
good play—action passes and run the
ball.’’

Running the ball has not been a
problem for Pitt this year. The Pan-
thers have piled up over. 2,000
yards on the ground. Gladman ac-
counts for 1,004 of it. Still, the
passing game has not been up to
par. That is where the importance
of Congemi comes in.

“Pitt took the ball and just ran
it down our throats,” Bicknell
recalled of his trip to Pittsburgh.
“That may not be a good strategy
for them this weekend against Penn
State.” ‘

There is an old belief in sports
that there is always one team that
a certain player consistently plays
better against. Baltimore Oriole
manager Earl Weaver based much
of his coaching philosophy on this
principle. Well, for John Congemi,
that team is Penn State.

“John Congemi is a ﬁne quarter-
back,” Penn State head coach Joe
Paterno said. “He always seems to
save his best game for us.”

Two years ago as a sophomore,
Congemi completed 21 of 29 at-
tempts for 284 yards and three
touchdowns in the 24-24 tie at Pitt
Stadium. Last year, Congemi was
impressive again, completing 16 of
21 passes for 204 yards and three
touchdowns. Needless to say, Pitt
blew out the Nittany Lions 31-11
at Beaver Stadium. Can Pitt make
"it two wins in a row against Penn
State?

“If Pitt is healthy, they will give

-Penn State all they’re worth,”

Bicknell said. “I’m not even sure
if it would be an upset if Pitt wins.”

The key word in that statement
is “if.” There are some other fac-

tors in the game beyond John

Congemi.

Pitt field goal kicker Mark
Brasco must come through when
the Panthers are within reasonable
range. He has not so far this year,
hitting only 5. of 13 field goals. .
Penn State’s Massimo Manca
kicked ﬁve last week against Notre
Dame, and is 20 of 25 on the year.

“What Pitt has to do is eliminate
turnovers completely and get a solid
performance out of the kicking
game,” West Virginia head coach
Don Nehlen said. “Penn State is an
excellent defensive football team.
They rely on their defense and their
kicking game. They are up and
down offensively, so their offense
just kind of waits around for the
defense to make a big play. Then
they either kick a field goal or run
it for a touchdown. If you don’t
turn it over to them, you have a
good chance of beating them.”

Bicknell agrees: “Penn State '
doesn’t beat itself; they have an ex-
ceptional kicking game. In a big
game, they can beat you with three
or four field goals.”

“They have a well-balanced at-
tack," Arians added. “There is not
a weakness on that football team.”

Is the deck stacked against Pitt?

How many times have we read ar-
ticles or seen documentaries on this
phenomenon? Aside from the United
States vs-. the Soviet Union, there are
no greater athletic rivalries than those
on the college gridiron. It seems that

' most of the time, a big showdown be-
tween two current powerhouses usually

. the same time, any matchup between
' two rivals, no matter‘ what_ the rank-
ings, almost always turns out to be in-
w teresting, if not exciting.

Such is the case with the 85th
meeting between Pitt and Penn State
tomorrow night. The long history of
this rivalry is ﬁlled with upsets and
unexpectedly close games. ,

Considering that these two teams
have dominated the East (and
sometimes the country) for the last
decade, it is "obvious that this game has
usually been one of major importance.
What is a great tribute to the two
schoolsis the fact that this is the ﬁfth
time in the last 10 years that this game
has involved the No. 1 team in the
nation.

In case you’re wondering, Joe Pater-

K no has led the Lions to four undefeated ,_

. seasons (’68-, ’69, ’73 and ’78) during

. ' his career. . _

- Stadium against Penn State since 1965.
They are 0-6-1. ' '

But if all of this has got you down
(that is, if you’re a Pitt fan), then let
me tell you a story.

Pitt has always been associated with
big time football. Earlier in this cen-

tury, Pitt was a major power and Penn
State was looking for recognition. PSU
had ﬁnally built up their reputation and
were looking to solidify’ it.

Last year . . .

_. v The Pitt News, November 22,1985 '

lAs I_see it  
_Pitt-PSU: Rivalry rich with tradition

The year was I916. PSU came into
the Pitt game sporting an 8-1 record.
They had been dominating all of the
other “also-rans" and were hoping to
knock off one of the big boys. They had
been winning games by frightful scores
(55-0, 50-7, 39-0, 48-2 and 40-0) -and

' even had one blowout with the score

of 79-0! They thought they had ﬁnally
made the big time when Pitt burst their
bubble to the tune of_ 31-0!

If you’re still in the mood, here’s 4
' another interesting story. During the

1947 and 1948 seasons, PSU ran up a

, 17-game unbeaten streak. During that

period, they were again destroying
teams in theiripath. They racked up win
after win by scores like these: '54-0,

75-0, 40-0, 46-0, 35-0, 37-7 and 47-0.,

Now, guess who it is who beat them
7-0 to break the streak? No, not
Abilene Christian. Pitt always seems
to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time as far as PSU is concerned. In case
you were wondering, yes, Pitt was also
the last team to beat them before the
streak got started.

This series has seen everything. It
has seenupsets, blowouts, scoreless

ties, teams ontheir ‘way to a national »

championship and-’ everything in
between. ' ._ _ .
This series, has even seen history

‘ made. In, the 1976 ‘battle, a.'_ running .
back by the name of Tony Dorsett mshed,

for 224"yards on 38 carries to take‘ over’

..the_ all-time NCAA rushing record.
‘ Dorsett had also set the seasonal record-
. by ﬁnishing with 1,948. yards. The

Panthers. won 24-7 and. went onto a na-

tional title; ’-

The game the previous year, had been -

decided in a most bizarre fashion. PSU

_defeated Pitt 7-6 when a PSU defender
- ' . blocked an extra point by timing the
 snap perfectly and leapfrogging the Pitt

center to easily block the kick.

, In 1983, ‘Paterno caused a» furor by
going for a ﬁeld goal on the_ game’s
ﬁnal play and ending an exciting game

’ in a not-too-exciting 24-24 tie.

But perhaps it was last year’s game
that showed what has made this such
a great rivalry. Hardly any mention
was made of the game compared" to
years past. It was thought to be a game
of “going through the motions”
because Pitt allegedly d_idn’t have a

‘ chance. I’ll adrnit that I, too, expected

joffensively:  » .

By‘ Jim Brueckner

an easy Penn State victory (as many do
this year). But 10 and behold, John
Congemi passed for 284 yards and
three touchdowns and the Panthers won
31-11.

._What does Saturday night hold for
the history of this series? I’d like to
start off by giving you a few interesting
stats about this series. _

0 Only three times in the last 11
years has a Penn State running back
gained over 100 yards against the
Panthers.

0. D.J . Dozier’s lifetime stats vs. ‘Pitt
are none too impressive. He has
managed only 50 yards on 23 carries.

0 The last ti-me that any receiver
from any team managed to collect eight
or more receptions in a game was the

1983 game when Bill Wallace pulled

in 10 for the Panthers.

0 Penn State has been shut out only
once in their last 154 games and only
twice in their last 222. Being realistic,
they won’t be tomorrow night either,
which brings us to that inevitable ques-
tion, what must the Panthers do to win?

As I see it, the Panthers can't rely

’ solely on their defense as they have all
year. Penn State will score, without a

doubt. Pitt must be prepared‘ to put big
numbers on the scoreboard‘. The Lions
will easily win a defensive battle-

;‘because of the uncanny accuracy of

placekicker "~._; Massimo ' vlylancal
Therefore, Pitt must ddthree, things.-
‘ 0- They must” averageﬁve yards on
ﬁrst down. Pitt will need to pass the
ball- well and they can’t do that if they

__ are in obvious_.pas“sing'situations, all‘
day. They must surprise the Lions.

'0’ John Congemiw must throw for
over 300 yards. He has had success
before against PSU, and it’ mu
continue. __ ’

0 Penn State’s opponents have been
turning the ball over consistently for the

' last ﬁve games. They know how to take

advantage of mistakes.’ Pitt" must avoid
this and must capitalize on every PSU
mistake.

Do not be disappointed if Pitt loses.
After all, Penn State is No. 1 in the
country. But if Pitt can accomplish the

three things mentioned above, we could -

see an upset. It’s a tall order (very tall)

: but_.we all know the history of the Pitt-
, Penn State rivalry.

Miller Time  

Dream game: Snuffy in the clutch vaults Panthers over Penn State  

By Randy Miller

It was a beautiful day for this long
awaited dream matchup. Then again,
a cool fall afternoon in November is
usually the rule when Pitt and Penn
State play one another.

This was one day, however, when
the two Eastern football powers went
at it in a way they never had before.

Yes, it still is Pitt and Penn State. But
it’s not every day you can put the Tony
Dorsetts, Mike Ditkas, Hugh Greens,
Lenny Moores and Jack Ham on the
same football "ﬁeld together — and have

This dream game never would have
been possible hadn’t Joe Paterno
coaxed Foge Fazio to again discuss a
possible Eastern football conference.
As the story goes, the two coaches
were talking conference strategies on
the coast of Guam when they found
“The Bottle.”

Actually, it was Fazio who found this
decrepit bottle on the naked beach
while Paterno was off ordering a bot-
tle of ﬁne Italian wine. By the time
Patemo returned, Fazio’s thirst was
quenched after he curiously drank from
“The Bottle.”

“It smelled like good whiskey,”
Fazio recalled saying to Patemo. Fazio
became a new man after sipping the
magic potion. Almost immediately, he
went from a chubby gray-haired man
to a young man in his early twenties.

Patemo was shocked with the results,
but keeping his head, quickly came -up
with his best idea since being named
the Lions’ head coach some 20 years
ago.

“We have coached against each
other three times,” Paterno remem-
bered saying to the bright-eyed Fazio.
“Pitt has won once, lost once and tied
once. In fact, since the two schools
have been going head-to-head, only
two games separate us — in 84 games!

 With this bottle we can get all the liv-

ing Pitt and Penn State players together
on the same ﬁeld. This will prove who
really is the best team.” '

Paterno went on to tell Fazio that he
would not drink from this fountain of
youth because he “wants to coach this
all-star game.”

“But Joe, who will coach Pitt?”
Fazio remarked curiously. “I am in
great shape and want to play. I don’t
even need my eyeglasses anymore.”

“We’ll get Johnny Majors,” Pater-

no said. “That’1l make your fans hap-
py-” -
Patemo and Fazio continued to argue
over where the game would be played.
Paterno claimed it was his idea, while
Fazio insisted it was he who found the
bottle. Fazio won and Pitt Stadium was
the sight. A few phone calls to the
players and a couple of swigs later,
there they were.

This year did indeed turn out to be
a “Celebration of Tradition” as Pitt’s
Sports Information Office proclaimed.

As expected, the contest wasn’t de-
cided until the final seconds. Snuffy
Everett’s 57-yard ﬁeld goal against the
wind as time expired proved to be the
game winner in Pitt’s 31-29 win.

Fans paraded onto the field tearing
down the goal post in the process, after
Everett’s winning kick. Paterno vio-
lently argued after the game protesting
that 11 seconds remained on the clock.

“I keep time with my Timex watch
every game,” Paterno pleaded to of-
ﬁcials. “And the alarm didn’t go off,
I tell you.”

Just when it appeared officials would
clear the fans from the ﬁeld and force

Congemi

con_tin_u§_d from page I_9
Maybe so, but if Congemi fulﬁlls
Gladman’s prophecy, there may be
a new No. 1 team in the nation next

week. ‘
Panther Patter: The game marks
the ﬁfth time in the last 10_ games
that one of the two teams has
entered the game ranked No. 1. 
The Pitt defense against the run is
ranked fourth in the nation, allow-
.ing only 91.3 yards per game. 
In total defense, Pitt is ranked 28th.

Pitt to kickoff, an undisclosed Pitt fan
saved the day for the Panthers. The
fans threatened Paterno by putting a
lighted torch at the seat of Paterno’s
famous whale pants.

“All right, all right,” screamed
Paterno. “Pitt wins, Pitt wins, just
please don’t hurt my lucky pants.”

The day even started bad for Pater-
no. Just before the kickoff, Paterno’s
wife Sue announced she would divorce
her husband if he didn’t get her seats
on the 50-yard line.

After an hour delay, Paterno hadn’t
found better seats. He did come up with
a ﬁeld pass and a clipboard, however,
and assigned her duties of charting
plays.

Finally, the matchup would begin.

Pitt drew ﬁrst blood as Dorsett broke
eight tackles on route to a 58-yard
touchdown run. Incidently, the former
Heisman trophy winner had to leave the
game in the third quarter when Pitt ran
out of his No. 33 jerseys. On each of
his 13 carries, Dorsett’s shirt was ripped
so much it had to be replaced.

Penn State closed to within one by
the end of the ﬁrst quarter as Matt and
Chris Bahr booted ﬁeld goals to pull
the Lions to 7-6. Patemo announced
before the game that 10 kickers would
suit up and each would have their own
speciﬁc conditions for kicking.

Pitt pulled ahead at 13-6 when Dan
Marino connected on a 38-yard scor-

ing pass with Ditka. Mark Brasco’s ex-
tra point attempt was wide right, break-
ing a long streak of 110 successive
PAT’s that started in his junior year at
Jeannette High.’

“I swear to God it was good,”
Brasco said, shaking his head. “I’m
telling you it looked good to me.”

Pitt’s lead was short—lived as the
Lion’s took a 14-13 lead on Curt
Wamer’s 12-yard run, followed by Ted
Kwalick’s two-point conversion pass
from Doug Strang.

The Lions upped the lead to 16-13
when Ham sacked Marino in the end
zone for a safety. Marino was injured
and did not return.

Pitt took the lead just before the half
when Fazio picked off a Chuck Fusina
pass and returned it 34 yards to the
Penn State nine. With Matt Cavanaugh
calling the signals, Pitt scored the go-
ahead touchdown on a 9-yard strike to
tightend Benji Pryor to give Pitt a 20- 16
halftime lead.

“That touchdown was my fault,”
Patemo said. “I should have known
better than to use 1 1 linebackers in the
game at one time. A safety would have
helped on this play.”

Pitt held the lead until late in the third
quarter when John Cappalletti scored
on a 6-yard option pass from Dick
Hoak. Pitt came right back though as
Gordon J ones’ 97-yard kickoff return
left them in a ﬁrst-and-goal from the

three. -

Ditka quickly called time-out and
consulted with Majors. Majors then in-
serted both Mark May and Bill
“Freezer” Fralic in the backﬁeld to
block for Charles Gladman.

After Gladman was stopped three
consecutive times by Penn State’s
tenacious 11 linebackers, Fralic scored
on fourth down from the two yards out
behind May’s block.

Brian Davis’ conversion run put Pitt
in the lead at 28-23 with only ﬁve
minutes remaining in the game.

Pitt could have iced the game with
3:02 remaining when Craig
“Ironhead” Heyward bulled his way
in the end zone from 11 yards out. But
Heywardfs run was nulliﬁed after
Patemo coaxed ofﬁcials into penaliz-
ing him for running "with a crutch.
Although Heyward’s leg was fractured,
a 15-yard penalty was induced.

The drive stalled when Carson
Long’s ﬁeld goal troubles against Penn
State continued. Long missed three in
the Lions’ 10-9 win in 1975 and begged
for a chance to redeem himself. Long’s
43-yard attempt was short and wide
left.

Penn State took advantage of the
missed ﬁeld goal. When Franco Har-
ris grabbed a deﬂected pass out of
nowhere on fourth-and-goal from his
own 45, the Lions regained the lead.
The play was disputed by Majors.

“Sean Farrell, their offensive guard,
touched that ball illegally,” Majors
declared. “He was ineligibly downﬁeld
and no ﬂags were thrown. I couldn’t
understand it." 1

Penn State was in the driver’s seat
with the 29-28 lead, having to kill the
ﬁnal 18 ticks. '

Artrell Hawkins took Brian Franco’s
kickoff eight yards deep in the end zone
but decided to run it out. He found a
wall to his left but ran out of running
room at Pitt’s 29. Hawkins pitched to
a speeding Joe McCall, however, who
dashed to the Pitt 42 before being hit
by Bruce Clark.

Before McCall’s knee hit the turf, he
lateralled to Paul Martha, who ran to
Penn State’s 40, before being run out
of bounds by a Penn State band mem-
ber with one second ‘left. “It was a
helluva play,” Majors said. “It worked
to perfection and we would have scored
if it wasn’t for that damn trombone
player who thought the game was over.

Everett, who wasn’t known for his
range, was given the crucial call
because “he’s a southern boy,” said
Majors. The Mississippi native calm-
ly lined up and sent the ball screaming
through the goal posts.

“I wasn’t nervous at all,” Everett
said after the game during his conver-
sation with President Ronald Reagan.

It’s a shame all games couldn’t be as
exciting as this one.

Lady Panthers top seed
at Big East tournament

By Kelly Butt
Staff Writer

Being No. 1 has its advantages; just
ask the Lady Panther volleyball team.
Pitt is the top seed team in the Big East
tournament this weekend, followed by:
Providence (2), Georgetown (3),
Syracuse (4), Connecticut (5), Seton
Hall (6), Villanova (7) and Boston Col-
lege (8). The Lady Panthers will take
on cellar-dweller Boston College at
11:30 a.m., Saturday in the quarter
ﬁnals.

Pitt easily handled the Eagles in two
previous games. Coach Shelton Collier
and his team expect to do the same this
weekend. Should the Lady Panthers ad-
vance to the semifinals, they will play
the winner of the Syracuse—Connecticut
game. Syracuse is the favorite in this
matchup, as the Orangemen have an
improving program among the Big East
conference. Last year, Syracuse ﬁnished
third in the Big East title race. “They’ll

. play well,”Collier‘said. “Traditional-

ly, Syracuse has never beaten Pitt. I’m
sure that’s a fact that will be in the
minds of both teams. Syracuse is a
good team, but right now, Pitt is the
better team.”

Assuming a win in the semifinals,
Pitt will play Sunday at 2 p.m. in the

_Dave Hooker/e Pitt News
Carolyn Brown

the winner of the Providence-
Georgetown game. The match between
the Hoyas and the Lady Friars will
prove to be a tough, extremely close
game. “I’m not sure who will win,”
Collier noted. “Providence has a slight
advantage, being the second-seeded
team and playing in front of their home
crowd. Providence has also beaten
everyone else in the Big East except
Pitt.”

ﬁnals, then the Lady Panthers will face T

If the Hoyas win it, the ﬁnal will be \
a rematch of the 1982 championship_

game, when Pitt emerged with the ti—“
tle. A Pitt-Providence game would be
the third time in three years that the
Lady Panthers have been cast against
Providence.

The Lady Panthers, with an 8-0 slate
in Big East action, have a very good
chance of winning it all again. While
they expect to be in the ﬁnals, anything
can happen. Pitt’s goal is to go to the
NCAA tournament. This is a goal
that’s still in reach for the Lady Pan-
thers, with. Providence and

_Georgetown being the roadblocks be-

tween Pitt and the NCAAS.

“We will be the most prepared team ‘lg
there,” said Collier. “Strategically, “ I

we’re prepared. We know what it takes
to win. I know we’re capable of play-
ing the caliber this tournament
demands.” _

The Lady Panthers have had a lot of
success in the Big East and in compil-
ing a 24-10 overall record this season.
One advantage Pitt could have over the
others is that they have recently played
a lot of nationally ranked teams and
their road. season has been very de-
manding. “We are going to try to do
the things we have been doing all
year,” Collier said. “We’ve had some
success in the Big East so they seem
to be working.”

The Lady Panthers have been cutting -;._,_

down on their practice time in favor of
quality time. They’ve been concen-
trating their serving ﬁnesseon the areas
of the court where their opponents
could be a little weak. Pitt will be us- 1
ing four of the best players in the Big
East. Judy Young, the setter, will need
to play well, even though a lot of the
responsibility will fall on the outside
hitters —- Denise Frawley, Lisa Stewart
and Kris Wexell. They need to play
well for Young to play well. Of course,
the Lady Panthers will need their other

v players to chip in. With any luck, the

injured Sue Hoover will be back to lend
her services to the team.

Lady Panther swimmers

For The Pitt News

The reigning Big East champions and
currently undefeated Lady Panther
swimming and diving team will attempt
to raise their dual meet record to 4-0
on Sunday as they host a tough Brown
team at Trees Pool. The dual meet is

‘ scheduled to begin at I p.m. Although
' Brown has 12 freshmen on their team,
E they are ranked in the Top 20 nationally
' in the preseason dual meet polls. This
A is the second Top 20 team Pitt has
2 faced this ‘year. Earlier, they had
. defeated an exceptionally strong
I Virginia squad. A victory over Brown
. would deﬁnitely give legitimacy to
Pitt’s claim to be among the best teams ‘
j in the country and would also serve as

a warning to the rest of the teams on
the Lady Panthers’ schedule.

The team comes into this meet with
the advantage of having three challeng-
ing meets behind them. This will be

’Brown’s first meet of the season. That

same advantage, however, may pose a
disadvantage as head coach David
Belowich does not knowvwhat to ex-
pect from his opponent, other than a
tough meet. “They probably have as
much depth as we’ll face all year,”
remarked Belowich. “They are a really

"solid team with a lot of good in-
, dividuals.”

ready to drown Brown

. By John Dent

One of those good individuals and

probably Brown’s best swimmer is
Karen Dieffenthaller, who coinciden-
tally was a summertime teammate of

‘ Pitt swimmer Susan Hickman. Both are
members of the Justus Dolphins Club
of Orlando, Fla. “Karen is a very com-
petitive swimmer who has a lot of
talent,” commented Hickman. “She is
a freshman, and it is going to be ex-
citing to watch her career develop. This
is going to be her ﬁrst collegiate meet.
Also, we are both sprinters and I am
looking forward to swimming against
her.”

The Lady Panthers’ strengthlies in

the diving-team- and the sprinters.
Belowich said he feels that “any given
diver can win on any given day. Here
we have a lot of depth.” He is also
counting on his sprinters. Susan
Hickman is a two-time All-America in
the 50-yard freestyle. Team co-captain
Alicia Dugan is also one of the top
sprinters in the East.

The women have been busy all week

preparing for Brown. “There is a quiet
resolve that we are going to do
everything we can to win this meet,”
said Belowich. “Sure, we are going to
cheer and yell on Sunday, but now we
are quiet and hard at work.”

In other swimming news, the Pitt

men’s swimming and diving team (2-0)
travels to Villanova today where they
will take on Boston _University.
