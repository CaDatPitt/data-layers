General MacArthur Day

Celebrated Here Today

Part of a nation-wide defense

stamp sales eﬂiort, “General Mac-

Arthur Day” will be celebrated here today with a military demonstra-
tion and a sales campaign for 100 per cent contribution of the local
battleship defense stamp committee. ‘

Aided by women of Kappa Kap-
pa Gamma social fraternity the
committee will conduct its stamp
sales primarily from the battleship
booth in the ground ﬂoor elevator
lobby. Roving salesmen will be sell-
ing stamps and bonds everywhere
on campus. "“’

Originating at the Michigan
School of Technology, where a
similar day was held last Saturday,
the idea has been taken up all over
the country. Local committee_ofﬁ-
cers stressed the fact that since
the Pitt leads the nation’: schools
in the sale of defense stamps and
bonds, local sales efforts on Mac-
Arthur day -should continue to set

S the pace.

Wednesday regimental inspec-
tion will be used as a symbol of the
day with the sanction of -Colonel

. Edward Y. Kelly, professor of mili-
, haryiscience and tactics. Colonel
Kelly, praising this day in tribute

to MacArthur, called it “a worthy"

plan.” .
' The campaign total to date is

6,550.75,’ highest college total
in the nation. Faculty replies to
committee solicitations are daily
increasing the totals which are
tabulated only on Wednesdays.

Faculty members and students
are advised that, by action of the
deans, classes in undergraduate

schools will be dismissed after 10:30

o'clock on Friday, April 17th. c

[Not Consulted On
Election Plans’
Declares Seyler

Commenting on SFA executive
committee’s refusal to accept the
suggestion of the non-partisan
advisory committee on student
elections, to .hold the voting in the
Cathedral, in State hall, and‘in
the Dental school, Elections com-

.mittee chairman William Seyler

said: I

“With regard to point two
‘made by SFA executive «commit-
tee, (which says that there was
no room to hold an election in
State hall,) word came from the
registrar's office that hall space,
adequate for voting purposes.
would be available in State hall.
The registrar’s oﬂice was ex-
tremely cooperative in helping us
ﬁnd a ‘place to conduct ballotting.

“Not only did the registrar's

office ﬁnd space for voting in State-
hall, but also suggested several.

spots in the Cathedral where the
voting could expeditiously be car-
ried, out. These places are: Room
124,. the corridor space in the base-
ment, and hall space on the ground
ﬂoor.”

Concerning point three of the
Executive committee’s statement,
which declared that “it was prac-
tically impossible to administrate
properlygthree polling places on
this particular day,” Seyler de-
clared:

“The S-FA executive committee
never asked the chairman of the
elections committee whether or
not the elections committee could
administer the
places. Yet, in a meeting with
the Student - faculty-administrm
tion advisory committee, the
chairman of the elections commit-
tee assured theadvisory commit-
tee that the administration of
three polling places would be
taken care of.

“It must also be remembered
that. the advisory committee gave,
as one of its reasons for the sug-
gesting three polling place system
—-—~“1t appears to be practical of
administration.” -

because it knows that, when once you decide
to speak, the present, unreal student govern-

ment, which neither gover'ns nor is of the

students———wil'l be shelved for a new, potent,
acting student government. , '

That, we ﬁrmly believe, is the real reason

the elections are in Memorial hall today in-

stead of in the Cathedral and in ‘State hall,

and in the Dental school.
And’there’s not a thing you can do about

three polling h

shell, the lifeless semblance of a -student gov-
ernment. It wants the status quo.

It is afraid of the dynamic, vital demo-
static change that must come if SFA is to
remain functioning.

SFA executive committee is afraid of you.
The 3,500 of you that could easily inject
interest, life, actuality into our dying stu-
dent government. The 3,500 of you that,
banded together could replace regression
with progress——could bring to Pitt a student
government that could do as much and may-
be more than any student government in
the world has ever done. Which is plenty.

SFA executive committee is afraid of you
and what you have to say. Desperately afraid.
That is why it can tolerate no critical opposi-
v.' That is why it has smeared the Pitt

si iwith--charges of L partisanship and par

. foryou to ..tell..how you feel

it. Nothing except go to Soldiers’ and Sail-
ors’ memorlal today and bury your dead stu-

dent government beneath a stack of used bal- s

lots. . 

We repeat, there's nothing else you can do
about it. The Pitt News tried and was im-
mediately charged with taking sides—-sup-
porting personal campaigns. An impartial
committee of students and faculty and ad-
ministration men and women tried and was
overruled by executive committee.

But the 3,500 of you. You haven't tried
yet. You don’t know how powerful you are.
But SFA executive committee, and the sys-
tem of fraternity domination of student
government that executive committee sym-
bolizes—they know. And they’re afraid.

So they're making it just a. little tougher

Third Consecutive IF Track Crown

Tomorrow afternoon the annual
spring festival fraternity track
meet will be run off again at the
Stadium. While, for most of the
fraternities on campus, this is just

\ another in the long string of sport-
ing events that help make the
school year a little more interest-
ing, for one house, Phi Gamma
Delta,.it is the highlight of the
athletic season.

For the past two years the Phi
Cams have shown their heels to
the rest of the fraternity cinder-
men and have come through with
decisive wins. Last year in particu-
lar the Fijis were in a class all by
themselves as they amassed 62 lé
points while the runner-up PiKAs

had to be content with only 18%
points.’

It was last year also that Fiji
Bobby Thurbon, the former Panther
halfback, captured three individual
events and gave his house a good
lead to work on in 440-yard relay.

Tomorrow the Phi Cams will
be out to win again. However, just
who will replace Thurbon and the
other Fiji tracksters who have
graduated is unknown. The defend-
ing champions, besides losing Thur-
bon last year, also lost such key
men as Earl Pressel and Bruce
Rueter.

Changes in this year’s track meet
include the elimination of the -140-
yard dash. Intramural oﬂicials feel

Navy Commander
Speaks to Students

Lt. Commander Paul Hartenstein
will speak to junior and senior men
today at 9:30 o’clock in Foster me-
morial on the requirements for en-
trance into the Navy reserve class

ent the mathematics requerements
necessary, he may obtain a waiver
to complete his mathematics as-
signments.

Enlistments in V-7 must be com-

_pletely accepted before May 1,
therefore interested students must
apply at once.

Students who attend the session

class upon leaving the lecture.

Conference crown as all six varsity
men are once again back.

Dick Trimble will be playing

that this event is too strenuous on
non-conditioned runners, and that
itis a folly to have the boys run
their legs oﬁ and their hearts out
just for a ribbon.

A new feature of tomorrow’s

meet is the including of girls’ nov-
elty races between the regular
events. The girls will get a chance
to practice throwing rolling pins
around and catching a greased pig,
both of which will probably come
in handy after they leave the Uni-
versity. r

Another novel ~ event on the
schedule for tomorrow is the an-
nual push-ball battle between the
members of the band and Pitt
Riﬂes. This sport, if it can be call-
ed such, is one in which the two
teams try to push a huge sized
ball across the Stadium green. The
winner is the team which can reach
the other’s goal first.

The first race of the day is card-
 for 2:30 o’clock and the entire
sturent body is urged to turn out
for the meet, which promises to be
the most interesting in recent years.

aseball p....;..

Saturda_v’s weird combination of
June in January weather deprived
Coach Ralph Mitterling of his first
opportunity to ‘watch his squad in
a full nine inning game. The squad
has been having daily seven inning
tilts but this was to have been the
first time they went the distance.

Saturday’s layoff was particular-
ly disturbing, for the regular prac-
tice sessions were rained out on
Thursdav and Friday. This coupled

with Saturday’s cancellation gave
the team a four day layoff, at a
time when the players need all the
practice they can get. The opening
game with Bucknell is just three
days away and the Coach has his
ﬁngers crossed for good weather
all this week.

Mitterling has been experiment-
ing with Johnny Vaiksnor, using
last year’s varsity shortstop in
right ﬁeld. If the conversion is suc-
cessful it will pave the way for Bill
Kostenbau_der, a sophomore who
has shown great promise in his
workouts at the midway station, to
take over as shortstop. It would
also keep Vaiksnor’s big bat in the
lineup, and in a team where punch
is sorely needed his batting may
have much to do with deciding the
‘fate of the Panther nine this season.

With Vaiksnor in right ﬁeld the
revised inﬁeld would show Johnny
