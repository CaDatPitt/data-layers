Pittsbu rgh
to skate at local rink

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

On Dec. 6, Citiparks will host
a_ hockey exhibititon in the
Schenley Park Ice Rink featuring
members of the Pittsburgh

’ Penguins.

According to Bill Backa, pub-
lic relations coordinator with Citi-
parks, center Rob Brown and
left—wing Troy Loney are sched-
uled to appear. As well, Citiparks
is anticipating that additional
Penguins will be in attendance.

Backa encourages ”kids and
area youngsters, as well as older
fans, to come and meet the
Penguins.” '

The program will begin at 4
p.m., with the first hour being
devoted to an autograph session.

Following this will be a free raf-
fle in which the Penguins will raf-
fle off hockey sticks and other
hockey items to those in at-
tendance.

Ending the festivities will be a
skating exhibition until 6:30 p.m.
Citiparks urges all to ”sharpen
your skate blades, get your ’skat-
ing legs’ and plan to skate with
members of the Pittsburgh Pen-
guins hockey team.”

Penguins

Backa explained that this pro-
gram has been in existence for
the past four years with the ex-
ception of last year when players
were unable to appear due to the
Penguins’ drive toward the
playoffs.

Backa said that the Penguin

players were looki-ng forward to i

the event. ”[Most] players like the
idea of going out and socializ-
ing,” he said.

Backa added that the younger

~ Penguin players seem to enjoy _

the ”fruits of their labor.’’

Backa expects a crowd num-
bering in the hundreds to attend
the event.

In addition to this program, the
Schenley Ice Rink hosts other
events. Among them are Tuesday
Night College Skating, where a
student with a college ID can
skate at a $1 discount. 1

Backa said that_the park is

presently attempting to set up _

special college nights for the in-
dividual universities. As of now,
Jan. 12 has been designated ”Pitt
Night,” and students will have
access tothe rink as well as the
sound system ”to make ' an-
nouncements and recognize in-
dividual groups attending.”

PARIS —— Wahid Gordji, an
Iranian Embassy employee
wanted for questioning in a
wave of Paris bombings, left
the blockaded embassy Sun-
day, appeared before a,magis-
trate and then departed for
Tehran, authorities said.

Simultaneously, Iran said
Paul Torri, France's senior
diplomat in Tehran who was
accused by the Iranians of spy-
ing, appeared, Sunday before
an Islamic tribunal there for
questioning that lasted past
midnight.

He then was placed on a
plane that left Tehran early
Monday, a French Foreign
Ministry official said.

But instead of Gordji flying
directly to Tehran and Torri to
Paris, an Iranian official said
they would be exchanged in
Pakistan.

Iranian Consul General Hus-

city of Karachi said the ex-

Suspect in French
bombing deported

freed after questioning by

sain Kashani in the Pakistani,

change took place early Mon-
day at the Karachi airport.

The moves led to immediate
speculation that the actions
were part of a deal stemming
from negotiations that led to
Friday's release in Lebanon of
two French hostages. V

The Frenchmen had been
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Mos-
lem extremists.

The refusal of Gordji to sub-
mit to questioning by inves-
tigating magistrate Gille
Boulouque prompted the
5-month-old embassy
blockade.

A state prosecutor in Paris,
Michel, Raynaud, said no
charges were filed against
Gordji, who is officially listed
as an interpreter, and he was

Boulouque. '

In Tehran, Torri, the French
Embassy first secretary who
was accused by the Iranians of
spying, appeared before an |s- ‘
lamic Tribunal at Evin Prison,
said the official Iranian news
agency‘ IRNA, monitored in

Cyprus.

E Breast cancer is a disease that

By Greg Keklak

On Dec. 9, the 7-Up Gnome
Tour will make a stop at Chil-
dren’s Hospital as part of a
promotional campaign which
started on Nov. 27 and is sched-
uled to end in Dallas on Christ-

”We want to help women un-

Gentry.

”They [the gnomes] are often
asked questions they don't want

the gnomes must know the right
thing to say in such a situation.

Bayer went on to say that the

PITTSBURGH — Three-year-
old Tabatha Foster sat up in bed
and played with green clay Mon-
day, a month after receiving five
new organs in a landmark trans-
plant operation.

”She’s rolling it up in a ball,
squishing it up,” said Lynn
McMahon, a spokeswoman at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Doctors are still concerned

about Tabatha’s new liver, which

hasn't been functioning up to par
for about a week, according to
Ms. McMahon. But there seems
to be no evidence of organ rejec-
tion, she said.

Tabatha remained in critical
but stable condition Monday in
the hospital's intensive care unit.

The Madisonville, Ky., girl
received a new liver, small intes-
tine, pancreas and parts of a
stomach and colon in a 15-hour
operation that ended Nov. 1. The

16 dieon state roads

over holiday weekend

HARRISBURG —— Wet weather
apparently contributed to the
death of a 57-year-old Doyles-
town man who was one of 16
people reported killed on state
roads during the Thanksgiving
holiday.

John H. Rittenmeyer apparent-
ly lost control of his car at about
9:30 a.m. Sunday on state Route
202 in Buckingham, Bucks
County, said a Buckingham
police department spokeswoman
who declined to give her name.

The car went off the slick road,
striking a retaining wall. Ritten-
meyer died at the scene, she said.

His body was transported to
Doylestown Hospital for an
autopsy.

Police had no leads Monday in
a hit-and-run accident in Bucks
County that killed a 19-year-old
hit-and-run victim.

Police in Bristol said they were

Barefoot man shot in
attempted store heist

PITTSBURGH — A 27-year-old
suburban Pittsburgh man was in
serious condition at Allegheny
General hospital after being shot
by a policeman outside a Shaler
Township convenience store ear-
ly Monday.

The gunfire followed an at-
tempted robbery at a Uni—Mart.

Hospital spokeswoman Elaine
Ashcom said Richard Schindler of
Shaler Township was in serious
condition after being considered
critical when admitted.

Shaler police said they did not
immediately file charges because
of Schindler's condition. He was
arrested around 2 a.m., following
an hour-long search near the
store.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December I, I987

Police said they could not ex-
plain why Schindler was
barefoot. Another convenience
store in nearby Millvalle was
robbed Sunday night by a gun-
man who was barefoot.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December 1, 1987 S

May llhelp you?

Taking a closer look at the people wo sr Pitt

By Julie Shepard

Staff Writer

Do you know the people in
your neighborhood? You know,
those people who perform differ-
ent services that we so easily can
take for granted? Consider the
functions of the campus bus
driver, the librarians, the informa-
tion desk attendants in the union,
the people at Kinko's and those
people at 7-11 who satisfy the
wild cravings we have at all hours
of the night.

But who are these people? Do

they like doing what they do?
What do they like best and worst
about their jobs? A time—out was
taken to answer these and many
other questions.

Joe Bechtold has been driving
the campus bus for Pitt since Au-
gust of 1986. However, Joe also
has other driving responsibilities.
Joe also drives various sports
teams, staff members and VIPs to
and from the Pitt campus. He said
he drives for ”whatever they
need me for.”

Bechtold drove school buses
before he got promoted to driv-

4’ 4".

Joe Bechtold keeps you moving every day

ing for Pitt. He claims that he
likes driving for Pitt better than
driving younger students because
”you can talk to the people at
Pitt. After a while, you know the
regulars. You really get to know
a lot of people.”

When Bechtold started driving
the campus bus one year and four
months ago, he said that he
”never expected the large crowd
that regularly rides the bus. At
1:10, 2 and 3 p.m. the bus is
packed.”

Bechtold is strict about check-
ing Pitt lDs. ”How would you
feel if you wanted to get on a full
bus and had a Pitt ID, but it was
already full of people without
lDs?” he asked. For this reason,
Bechtold feels he must abide by
the rules.

Next in line is Pat Colbert — a
library specialist that works in the
lnterlibrary Loan section of
Hillman Library. In the course of
Pat's day, she fills requests of
both staff and students for infor-
mation not found on Pitt's cam-
pus. She has access to books,
articles and newspapers among
other sources anywhere in the
United States and overseas.

Pat said that she gets ”about
300 requests per month but can
only fill about 200 of them.” This
is due to sources that are already
in-use, lost or that are not in cir-
culation anymore.

Pat has been in her position for
six years. She said she really likes

Pat Colbert helps you find the right book

‘ her job and feels that she works

with many good people. She said
that her job is ”interesting” and
”constantly a source of new in-
formation.” And although many
people may be unaware of her
services, she claims that ”things
can really get crazy!”

Going from one kind of infor-
mation to another, the desk atten-
dents in the William Pitt Union
have a lot to say. What do those

people behind the desk really
know? Sandy Patterson, a junior
at Pitt, was available to answer
our query.

Patterson said that she got in-
terested in working at the infor-
mation desk because her brother
worked there while he went to

Pitt. She also thought that it"

”looked like a fun and interesting
jOb'.”

  Cancer

 

Continued from page 1
”[The |nstitute’s] dietary guide-
lines for lower cancer risks
recommend lowering dietary fat
from the current average of 40

V percent of daily calories to 30
‘ percent or lower,’’ Gentry said.

Gentry also said that research-
ers believe such changes could
lead to a much lower incidence

for ‘many cancers, including
breast cancer.

According to the booklet, no
one knows exactly why a normal
breast cell becomes cancerous,
and there is probably no single
cause. It is thought that breast
cancer results from a combina-
tion of factors such as inherited
susceptibility, hormonal levels

and a woman's life history and
lifestyle.

Cancer development is
presently seen as "a multistep
process. First, an initiator irrever-
sibly damages a normal cell,
changing its genetic makeup.
Then a substance called a
promoter may cause the cell to
begin reproducing itself continu-

rWorking wives give
no adverse effects

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — An in-
crease in the number of married
women in the work force hasn't
affected the widening gap be-
tween rich and poor, an
economist who studied U.S. cen-
sus data from 1967 to 1984 said
Monday.

”The various effects of the in-
crease in working wives simply

cancelled each. other out,” said-

Edward C. Budd, a retired Penn
State University professor.
Average earnings among wom-
en in lower income groups_in-
creased from about the same as

their spouses in 1967 to nearly .
twice their husbands’ earnings in V

1984., Budd said. J '
Meanwhile,wives in upper in-
come groups joined the work

force in greater numbers, even

though they earned farless than
their husbands, he said.
’ Budd, who conducted the
research with Douglas Wion, an
associate professor of economics
at Lock Haven University,
blamed the increasing gap be-
tween rich and poor on a grow-
ing disparity in men's earnings.
Budd and Wion reached their

ously to form a tumor.

. In general, 80 percent of
cancers are tied to the way peo-
ple live their lives. These lifestyle
factors include diet, smoking, al-
cohol consumption, excessive
sun exposure, workplace en-
vironments and air and water pol-
lution.

. For breast cancer in particular,
it is thought that lifestyle—based
risk factors are diet, radiation and
hormone drugs. Variance in the
rate of breast cancer occurrence
in different areas of the world

have been linked to diet. Obese‘

women run a higher risk of get-
ting breast cancer. Radiation from

_ X-rays, medical and otherwise,

generally increases the risk of de-
veloping breast cancer. Finally,

conclusions by dividing the work"
force by husbands’ earnings and
then seeing what effect working

. wives had on the family income,

Budd said.

Just less than a third, or 32.1
percent, of women whose hus-
bands ranked in the top 10 per-
cent worked in 1967, the study
showed. L

That figure increased to more
than half, 56.3 percent, in 1984,
according to the study, complet-

ed earlier this year.

Meanwhile, 52,4 percent of
women whose husbands ranked
in the bottom fifth worked in
1967, while 62.8 percent worked
in 1984, the study showed.

”All of the new products and
processes we've developed for
the house have released women
from a lot of work, which is more
important for the upper-income
wife because she can afford those
things,” Budd said.

Wives whose husbands ranked
in the bottom fifth saw their aver-
age income increase from $2,227
in 1967 to $8,615 in 1984, ac-
cordingto the study.

Their husbands’ income,
meanwhile, only increased -from
$2,140 to $4,991 during this
period.

, the link between breast cancer

and hormone treatments i-s still
unclear, but some think it exists.

Although many of the factors
influencing the development of
breast cancer are not subject to
control, the booklet stresses that
there are several risk factors that
a woman can control.

The booklet suggests that wom-
en should make ita habit to give
themselves a breast self-
examination once “each month,
since the earlier cancer is found,
the easier it is to treat.

Boyfriend
feels he's
pressured
to perform

Q: My girlfriend and I attend
the same college and have been
steadies for three terms. Three
months ago, we had sex for the
first time ever for both of us. We
took it easy, but it hurt her a good
deal, and for that reason, we
have not tried again.

I don't want to hurt her, but I
worry that this avoidance will
turn into a freezeout, and I do
want to keep her. She is saying
now that we'll try again after
exams. Does that sound real to
you? I kind of doubt it. In any
case, what should we do?

A: Well, I say first things first,
and don't try anything until after
exams. Until exams are over,

things will be tense enough._

Don't add this anxiety to it, and
don't try intercourse again until

' you can both put your minds to

it entirely. Her reason for not try-
ing again now sounds sincere to
me, and also sensible.

If her discomfort persists, she
should see a gynecologist. Don't
let me hear that she is too shy or
doesn't want to do that until she

is married! Old enough to have '

sex is old enough to go to a gy-
necologist. If it turns out that she
has no physical reason to cause
her pain, if she is just nervous,
then you two should. hug and kiss
and wait. Don't let impatience
spoil a good relationship.

nn. RUTH
WESTI-IEIMER

Q: Pretty much at my insis-
tence, we have been practicing
safe sex — only doing things that
can't possibly lead to. pregnancy
or a sexually transmitted disease.
This is making my girlfriend im-
patient. I know that may sound
conceited, since it is usually the
guy who wants to rush things, but

she really is the pressuring one‘

this time. One thing she harps on
is that if we go on too long do-

ing what she says is really only

foreplay, we will be harming our

future sexual development. Is‘

there anything to this?

A: Absolutely not. If you love
each other and you engage only
in activities that provide no wor-
ries about either pregnancy or
sexually transmitted diseases, that

should be In Teficial. Until the

time comes vhen you get mar-
ried and want to have a child, the
idea that your sex life has to in-
clude intercourse ~— vaginal
penetration — is a mistake.

You can go on just doing fore-
play or heavy petting until you
are both company presidents,
and no psychological harm_wiII
be done. You can both walk with
a bounce because you know you
are taking no chances with your
plans for a wonderful life. The
only time there might be some
problem would be when one
partner fixates on penetration, on
full sexual intercourse. Frustration
can do harm. But frustration can
be avoided by understanding that
no harm Comes of -staying with
those safe practices.

”The desk is usually pretty
busy. It is primarily there to an-
swer questions about the Union,
but we get all kinds of ques-
tions,” Patterson said. ”Some—
times we get pretty far—fetched
questions, but usually, they are
not hard to answer with the facil-
ities we have available to us.”
Patterson feels that the most
sought—after piece of information
is ”Where is Dining Room A and
B?” Next in line is ”Where’s the
Kurtzman Room?” She said that
that's the hardest to explain be-
cause ”many people become
Confused when you tell them to
go around one corner and then
around another.”

Approximately 12 people work
the information desk that was de-
veloped when the Union was
remodeled. Most of these people
just work in their spare time.
However, when in the position
that Sandy and her co-workers
are in, as she said, ”you run into
a lot of interesting people and
questions.”

Moving on to the people and
services that aren't connected as

directly to Pitt are those who
work ’round the clock, so you
can have that copy any time you
need it.

Chris Steffy, a staff member of
Kinko's, thinks that his job is
”... fun. It seems like everyone in
Pittsburgh comes in here.”
Steffy’s assumption seems almost
realistic when considering that
between 700-900 people use
Kinko's services on a daily basis.

”Most of our customers used to
be students. Now, though, about
one-third of our customers are
businessmen. They come in to
use our Apple Maclntoshes but
also end up leaving things to be
Copied,” claimed Steffy. ”We
help save these businessmen a lot
ofgtime and give them the quali-
ty they want.”

The majority of their business
still centers around students,
though. Steffy feels that ”most of
[their] volume comes from the in-
dividual copies that people make
on their own. We're in a good,
convenient location. Many stu-
dents take advantage of that
which also helps keep our prices
so low.” A

Joe Mezlack works in the 7-11 on Forbes Ave.

Steffy claimed that the quality
of the work produced behind
Kinko's counter is ”the best in
town.” In fact, the Kinko's chain
nationally is almost ”tops"

in volume in the country.

”This is a great place to work
if you're a student,” said Steffy.
”The hours are real flexible, the
people are a lot of fun, and the
extra cash you make really helps
out.”

Last, but not least, are the clerks

of 7-11. Joe Mezlack, the Assis-
tant Manager of the Forbes
Avenue location, gives his store
a positive outlook.

’’I started working here in
February, 1987 as a stockboy.
Now, I'm assistant manager.
There are great opportunities here
for advancement.”

Mezlack, in his position, feels
that ”the people I work for are
fair. There's really nothing I don't
like about this place.”

‘ PALMER, Alaska — A major
earthquake jolted south-central
Alaska on Monday, knocking out
power to one community and
prompting authorities to urge the
evacuation of low-lying coastal
areas because of a possible sea
wave.

_ The quake struck at 10:23 a.m.
Alaska Standard Time and meas-
ured 7.4 on the Richter scale. It
was centered 300 miles southeast
of Anchorage in the Gulf of
Alaska.

The Tsunami Warning Center
in Palmer issued a warning cover-
ing nearly the entire southern
coastline of the state and coastal
British Columbia. A tsunami (ti-

dal wave) watch was in effect for .

the rest of Alaska, Washington,

' Oregon and California.

In Yakutat, the small village
closest to the epicenter, the
quake knocked ou_t power but

'caused no major structural

damage, said City Manager Jim
Filip.

'The latest quake comes just a
week after another major quake
prompted a tsunami warning that
sent thousands of coastal resi-
dents seeking higher ground but
was canceled 90 minutes later
when no tsunami materialized.

The Richter scale is a measure
of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of
one number means a tenfold in-

  
 
 
  
    
   
 
  

 

crease in magnitude. Thus a read-
ing of 7.5 reflects an earthquake
10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
An earthquake measuring 7 is
a ”major” earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

Election called off as

15 Haitians murdered

PORT-AU—PRlNCE, Haiti —
Residents of the capital stayed
home from work Monday, afraid
to venture into streets where a
voter-targeted terror campaign
forced cancellation of Haiti's first
presidential election in 30 years‘.

More than two dozen people
were killed in the violence, in-
cluding 15 people shot or hacked
to death at a polling place Sun-
day before the election was
called off by the Electoral
Council.

Armed bands had rampaged
through Port-au—Prince, armed
with machine guns and ma-
chetes. They fired randomly at
passersby but attacked voters and
election officials more method-
ically. .

Election observers, diplomats
and journalists were also shot
Sunday as soldiers stood by,
refusing to intervene.

Within hours, the independent
council was dissolved by the
military-dominated provisional
government, led by Lt. Gen. Hen-
ri Namphy, which had done

nothing to try to ensure safe bal-
loting.

The shooting died down short-
ly after the election was called off
but echoed through the night
from the city's slums. There was
no gunfire Monday morning in
the squalid capital of one million
residents.

Truckloads of soldiers patrolled
the streets Monday morning, roll-
ing slowly past iron-shuttered
storefronts. Nearly all businesses
were closed.

”People are afraid to go down-
town. I went to take pictures, but
I didn't feel safe,” said Max Ben-
jamin, a Haitian free—lance pho-
tographer for The Associated
Press.

Reagan gets famous

neckware; to help art

LOS ANGELES — Neckwear
once owned by Rudy Vallee is on
its way to President Reagan and
former Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone in hopes of
winning VIP support for an inter-
national art competition.

More than 600 ties from the
late actor-crooner’s wardrobe will
be used in the promotion for the
International Art Challenge, said
John Schalter, who bought the
Vallee tie collection for $4,500.

While the tie-in between art
and neckwear may seem remote
to some, Schalter said he hoped

ghigh-level interest would be a
boost to next year's competition.

One tie already is on the way
to Nakasone, and another, featur-

About 100 ties, some adorned

The tie collection was selected

side a locked attic in Vallee’s

Three cheers for i
the athletic dept.

It is heartening to see that the athletic department was able
to find the necessary funds to send the Pitt band to the Blue-
bonnet Bowl in Houston. '

Last week, there was considerable uproar on campus over
a disclosure that the band might not be able to attend the game
for budgetary reasons. During the regular season, the band
works very hard to promote a level of excitement among the
fans and players that is helpful in winning football games.

To deny the band the right of seeing their team through one
of the most important games of the season wouldjhave been
completely unacceptable.

We at The Pitt News applaud the work of the athletic depart-
ment in assuring that the band be given the opportunity to fin-
ish their work this season. In- the future, we hope to see the
same consideration givento the band. In light of the commit-
ment they have shown thus far, the Pitt band deservesno less.

It looks to me like World War III
Underneath the Christmas tree

— Timbuck 3, from the single ”All I Want For Christmas”

Each Christmas, all of us who celebrate the holiday are con-

fronted with the problem of what to buy for the various peo-

ple on our lists. Usually, children are the easiest. They are’ easily
pleased, and their interests are varied enough to assure that near-

ly any gift will be appreciated. s

However, among this year's crop of toys to be had for chil-

-_ dren are an alarming number of war toys. Toys that teach the ,

virtues of superior firepower, a paranoia of the inescapable

I threat of communism and and that reinforce the notion that war

is nothing more serious than a Barbie Doll.

If we are interested in promoting peace, and it certainly would
be difficult to find someone professing other objectives, the toys
many are providing for their children are working in direct op-
position to that goal. How large is the jump from a toy being
touted for its greater firepower to support of a public policy
dedicated to higher firepower? '

It seems a reasonable assumption that-to break the vicious
circle of war toys to war games to war itself, we must first take
a link from the chain. Buy the children on your list a toy that
does something other than encourage fantasies of murder and
military domination. V

In a holiday celebrating the birth ofjesus Christ, oerhaps one
of the most committed pacifists ever to grace the Earth, a plas-
tic gun under the tree, itself a symbol of the Druidic honor of
life, resembles nothing so much as a thoughtless desecration
of a holy place.

Yes, you too, can live in The Naked City! '

You don't have to be born in The Naked City to
live there. Pack up your bags and move to the
only place in America where everybody is a star.

The reports of your tone will not be exaggerated!

Next to nothing to show  

mighty, proud, rich country be- 

Due process of law is fairly
tricky, routinely corrupt and aw-

‘ fully expensive. The press, there-

fore, must raise hell on behalf of
the poor. To cite proof of this as-
sertion, one needs~on|y to look at

* the plight of street people, victims

of disease, post—graduate liberal
arts majors or victims of the un-
derworld. To take any of these
cases is not especially indemnify-
ing for the legal system. The poor

cannot pay, and the Mafia shoots ‘

to kill.

Obviously, pious believers in
due process of law can work
around these criticisms because
although the system is surely not
perfect, it is the best system there
is, and good, on the ‘mean, pre-
vails. Such persons have never
been short of the 25 bucks neces-

, sary to get to small-claims court

or the educational level needed
to present-a flawless case, or the

courage necessary to stand up to
an attack, which could fail, and
which is, in or out of court, an
emotionally expensive involve-
ment in a confrontation with
another human being or group of
human beings.

Due process of law is subor-
dinate to' the free press, not in
principle, but in justification be-
cause the people who need it
most have no means. The press
must point out to city hall that
skinheads are tearing up neigh-
borhoods, that street persons
have nowhere to go and are
freezing and that victims of dis-
ease are being excluded from the
ffuits of hospice care in this

cause middle-class lawyers with
all their infinite wisdom but finite

- means, given that next vacation,

have no patience for the disin-
herited, dispossessed, tortured,

maimed and otherwise cheated a

persons on the receiving end of

this debased republic of gold.
Human rights — to shelter, to

food, to peace of mind and to due

process of law — are not honored .
or even very widely understood A

in America. So, if the courts and
city hall, or the neighborhood, or
the professionals or the schools
cannot get it together to make
shrill noises on behalf of the
citizens of this country who are
in torment and fear, then the
press will have to do it — in
good, if fallible, conscience.

The bliss of wimpy ignorance

In response to the article, ”Pop
Muzik and the void,” I have three
words: wimpy, wimpy, wimpy:
The article started out strongly,

i.e. deploring the schism between E

the sentiments of pop music and
the cold, hard reality of our
materialistic society. But then the
article took a strange twist, some-

thing to the effect of ”So what?” ‘

After all, ”... [music] is just a
diversion. It is entertainment 

the myth and style surrounding‘

music and discussion of it are just
trappings.” Hogwash. Does this
mean that lyrically expressed
ideas merely cajole the average
Joe? Yep, after a hard day, ”War:
what is it good for? Absolutely
nothing” really helps me unwind.
Or perhaps knowing that I/1,000
of my concert ticket is helping the
poor and needy relieves my guilt
from not otherwise giving a damn
about them.

But what is music to the needy
themselves? Is reggae simply ”en-
tertainment” to the Jamaican? Or
more germanely, is punk simply
bad music that somehow ”enter-
tains” social misfits? Think: you
are 15-20_ years old and realize

LETTERS

that you have your choice of shal-
low, meaningless ”careers,” each
available at the low, low costof
conforming to the established
career stereotype. I mean,,we
can't all grow up to be Mahatma
Gandhi. From this perspective,
what can music become? A
means of expressing your in-
dividuality in a ”do as the others
do” society. Ignoring this vital
power of music was Wimpy No. I.
Wimpy No. 2 was the unin-
formed reference to ”under-
ground music.” Talk to people
who listen to the many varieties
of alternative music and you real-
ize: 1) itoften exhibits an ideal-
ism which puts the Summer of
Love to shame, 2) for its advo-
cates, there is often a commit-
ment to this idealism that brings
the music beyond the superficial
realm of ”entertainment," 3) we
don't all wear black. (Consider-
ing the author finds the music
”un|istenable," his ignorance is
”understandable.”) A

People are different. Different I

music styles appeal to different
people's styles. Not all music is
equally accessible. Yet, these
facts cannot justify criticising
something you don't understand.
Pointing out that music is simply
entertainment for some people is
ﬁne. Yet, music is more than ”en-
tertainment" for many people.
The narrow perspective reflected.
in the articles conclusion is
Wimpy No. 3. '

Volleyball team receives bid from NCAA

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

\

The Pitt women's volleyball
team received a well—deserved in-
vitation from the NCAA tourna-
ment selection committee last
Sunday evening.

Despite a 37-5 record, the Lady
Panthers had feared that their loss
to Providence in the Big East
semifinals might keep them out

Jackson

finds
Pittsburgh
to his
liking  

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer-

Former University of Pittsburgh
standout Rickey Jackson certain-
ly has seen the bad days playing
outside linebacker for the once-
woeful New Orleans Saints.

Since’joinin'g‘the'club in 1980,
Jackson had never experienced
the satisfaction of a winning sea-
son in the NFL, let alone a berth
in the league playoffs.

How could he? The Saints were
the NFL’s perennial laughing-
stock, a franchise that had never
finished the season with more
wins than losses since its incep-
tion in 1967 (although twice the
club finished at the .500 mark).

All that's changed. Drastically.

Under second-year head coach
Jim Mora, New Orleans has bolt-
ed out to an 8-3 mark, including
a crucial 20-16 defeat of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers this past Sunday at
Three Rivers Stadium. The victo-
ry insured the club of its first win-
ning season ever. Fans in the
Louisiana bayou are caught up in
delirium of a potential playoff
spot, and many analysts are call-
ing the Saints one of the most
solid teams in professional
football.

But for some reason, the griz-
zled veteran Jackson isn't getting
caught up in the hype. As defen-
sive captain of the club, he is
keeping a cool profile and saving
any celebration for when the

Saints are assuredly marching‘

into the playoffs.

”I ‘feel good about it, but we

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH — They had to
pay a high price for it, but a
strong dose of hot Coffey has
been exactly what was needed to
revive the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The Penguins completed the
NHL’s biggest trade in years last
week — acquiring five-time All,-
Star defenseman Paul Coffey in a
seven-player deal_with the Ed-

of the tournament. Their fears
proved unfounded as the selec-
tion committee apparently took
Pitt's superior record as well as
victories over Penn State, Ohio
State and Houston into account.

The Lady Panthers will travel to ‘

Champaigne, Ill., to take on the
eighth-ranked Lady lllini from the
University of Illinois on Thursday
evening. The Lady lllini recently
captured their second consecu-

need one more [win]. As far as
I'm concerned, this isn't really
even a winning season for us yet
— not until we win nine games,”
said Jackson. ”If there wasn't a
strike this year, we still could
have finished the season at 8-8.
We need one more for me to feel

monton Oilers — with one pur-
pose in mind. That was to make
the playoffs they've missed for
five consecutive seasons.

And if Coffey’s first three games
in a Penguins’ uniform are any in-
dication, making the playoffs may
be the least of their worries.

”I’m happy with the deal. I
hope Edmonton is,” said Coffey,

’a two-time Norris Trophy winner

as the NHL’s premier defense-
man. ”I- had the chance -to‘'- play

tive Big 10 championship and
will enter the NCAA tournament
with a 28-6 record.

Despite the high caliber of
competition, Pitt coach Shelton
Collier feels the Lady Panthers
will be in the race. ,

Said Collier, ”Playing Illinois
Thursday night before a capacity
crowd will be agreat environ-
ment for my team. We have
drawn a team [Illinois] that we

we have a winning season.”
Against the Steelers, Jackson
turned in a typical stellar perfor-
mance, the kind that has repeat-
edly earned him All-Pro
nominations the past four years as
well as trips to the Pro Bowl. He
contributed seven tackles, sacked

on three Stanley Cup winners in
Edmonton, the chance to play

V with Wayne Gretzky.

”But now I have the chance to
play with Mario Lemieux, and I

. think the talent is here to make

the playoffs. But it takes all 20
guys, not just one or two.”

It took four" guys — promising
center Craig Simpson, ‘first-round
draft choice Chris Joseph and

veterans Moe Mantha and Dave A
Hannan f+ to pry Coffey and left ,

have a chance to beat. With our
team relying mainly on juniors
and seniors, we should be able to
handle the crowd and pressure.

”You read about upsets every
day in sports. Hopefully, on Fri-
day, everyone will be reading
about how we upset Illinois. We
are only three victories away
from the Final Four.”

For four Pitt seniors, going to

game late in the fourth quarter.

minutes remaining in the contest.

wings Dave Hunter and Wayne
Van Dorp from the defending
Stanley Cup champion Oilers.
The Penguins also will get the
first opportunity to negotiate with
free-agent goaltender Andy Moog
after the Olympics.

General Manager Eddie Johns-
ton has been accused of mortgag-
ing the,Penguins’ future for a
quick playoff fix now— and, pos-
sibly, to save his job, since it long

Team Captain Louise O’Shaugh-
nessy commented, ”It is great for
the seniors. We get to keep" reach-
ing for our dream, making the

Top 16 in the NCAA. I think it is _

awesome that we still have a few

bid] is something. We deserve it,
and a lot of people on the selec-

tion committee must have real-

 

' ized that. It is a big chance for our

program, and we have the play-
ers to do the job,” said Stewart.

An enthused Krista Ziener stat-
ed, ”I am happy about getting
another chance. The possibility of
not participating in the tourna-
ment was hard to take because
we. had lost to a team [Provi-
dence] that we had beaten the
night before and earlier in the
season.”

For middle blocker Noreen
Coughlin, the challenge is dead
ahead. She will be challenged at

the net by two All-Americans for
the Lady lllini. ”Noreen will look
at this match as a chance to prove
herself,” said Coach Collier.

A proud coach, Shelton Colli-
er commented on his team: ”The
returning players from last year
really made a commitment to not
only qualify for the NCAA tour-
nament but to improve our seed-
ing in the tournament as well.
This happened, and I am very
pleased for the players who have
put in a lot of hard work.”

This Thursday night the Lady
Panthers will be in Champaigne,
a reward for their commitment to
excellence.

Pollard.
The pass never got there.

”My job on the play was to
rush the quarterback and con-
tain,” said Jackson. ”I broke

through the line and put some I

pressure on Malone. I got a

- chance to get my hand up and

knock the ball away.”

”What can I say about it?” said
Malone. ”People say I should
have thrown the ball sooner be-
cause he was open right away,
but I couldn't see [Pollard] be-
cause it was so congested in
there. Jackson made a great
play.’’

A Pollard sweep was stuffed on
fourth down, and the Saints
picked up their eighth win of the
season. ”I was looking for that
sweep.‘ I've seen them run it’ on
film. Anytime [Pollard] comes in
the game in that situation, they
run it. I alerted the guys to watch
for that play in the huddle,” said
Jackson.

”We’re a very aggressive
defense. Anytime we get aggres-
sive and get after people, they
can't handle it. They can't handle
the pressure. I give credit for this
season to our defense and the

work of our special teams.”
New Orleans’ defense is rated
third overall in the NFL, third
against the pass and fourth
against the rush. Clubs have been
reluctant to pass against the
Saints, as they lead the league in
interceptions with 25.

”Our defense has been win-
ning everything for us,” boasted
Jackson.

Sunday's game marked the first
time Jackson has played in Pitts-
burgh since leaving Pitt in 1980
(Jackson played at Pitt from
1977-80). The Saints have met
the Steelers both in 1981 and
1984, but both contests were
played in the New Orleans Su-
perdome.

’’I was really excited about
coming back to Pittsburgh -to
play. I have a lot of great friends
here. A lot of people I know from
Pitt came. Sal Sunseri [Pitt line-
backer coach who played with
Jackson for three years] and his fa-
mily were here. A lot of people
were up there hollering for me.

”There were mixed emotions.
The Steelers are big around here,
but we needed this win,” said
Jackson.

”I feel that the team is capable

head coach Rande Stottlemyer.
”We are gaining a lot of much-

couple of tournaments. We start-

but I am, by no means, satisfied
by the performance.”

Pitt's No. -I-ranked Pat Santoro
continued his dominance of the

up the Panthers’ only first-place
finish.

”I feel that Pat may be the best
overall wrestler in the country at

finished higher. In his semifinal
match, Rossi took an 8-6 lead into
the last few minutes of the match,
buton a purely defensive move,
he was turned over and pinned.

”That was one of the worst
things that could happen to
Mike,” said Stottlemyer. ”He just
got stuck by a mistake that he
made and lost the match.”

Mike Tongel was the only other
wrestler to place for the Panthers,
finishing fifth. Stottlemyer also
said that freshman Scott Hovan
and heavyweight John Owens
did decent jobs but implied that
they could do much better.

This" weekend, Pitt travels to
Las Vegas, Nev., for the Las Ve-
gas Invitational. This is the first
time that Pitt is competing in this
tournament, and they will square
off against some of the best teams
in the country, including last
year's NCAA national champion,
Iowa State.

”This will be like a mini-
nationals for the guys,” said Stott-
|emy'er. ’’It is exactly what the
kids need to see. It will give
everybody the experience of
competing in a big meet. But it
is like I always say, ‘It's not how
you come out of the shoot, it's
how you finish that counts.’ ”

the Oilers trade him, yet he was
on the ice for 27 minutes as the
«Penguins rallied from a four-goal
deficit and beat the Quebec Nor-
diques 6-4 last Wednesday. He
had three assists and helped the
Penguins convert three of their fi-
nal four power-play opportu-
nities.

In less thanua week in Pitts- ‘ ..

burgh, Coffey has:

0 Helped the Penguins to two
wins and a tie in three games, in-
cluding their first road victory of
the season.

0 Revived a dismal Penguins’
power play that had been con-
verting only l4.7 percent of its
opportunities. He's contributed
five assists in three games, all on

pOW€I' plays, 35 the Penguins V

play chances.

0 Given Lemieux, the center
who's considered hockey’s
second-best player to Gretzky,
the world-class teammate he's
lacked the past three seasons. ”I

ment each other very well,”
Coffey said.

Scotty Bowman, the former
Montreal and Buffalo coach,
compares the \ Lemieux-Coffey

tandem with the old Phil-

Esposito-Bobby Orr duo of the
Boston Bruins.

”It is difficult to defend against
two great players on the same
team,” Bowman said. ”I used to
dread playing Boston when they
had Orr and Esposito.”

confident air of a winner. ”There
is a fine line between winning

the Penguins have sold out both
