Process For Activities Fee Change Set

SA, Student Affairs Ma

by POHLA SMITH
S News Editor

The four Student Association
commissioners met with
staff members of the Student Af-
fairs Office Friday“ to establish
budgetary safeguards for the col-
lection of Student Activities fees.

Because the University can be
held legally accountable for fees
collected. the Student Affairs Of-
fice has stated it will not recom-
mend the University act as a col-
lection agent without budgetary
safeguards.

V In a statement released to the
Pitt News following the meeting.
the office said:

“The Office of Student Affairs
recognizes that the Student Activ-

ities Fee supports many endeavors
which are beneficial to the stu-
dent body and enrich campus life.

"Therefore. the office will en-
tertain the prospect of endorsing
the collection of this fee as part

of the invoice billing process if '

the Student Association can satis-
fy this office that their budget-
ing. allocation. disbursement. and
accounting procedures meet those
standards that were in existence
when the University originally
agreed to collect the activities
fees and endorse the student allo-
cations process."

Following the meeting Bill

Markus. director of Student Activ-
ities and SA advisor_ explained ’

some of the budgetary safeguards
that had been discussed at the
meeting.

“Today we’ve agreed that there
are certain conditions. necessary
for a minimally acceptable pro-
gram in terms of fee disburse-
ment and collection,” said Mark-

I

MARKUS: Remains SA advisor.

The SA advisor said that every-
one feels there is a need for a sys-
tem of checks and balances to
prevent inequities under the pre-
sent system of allocating funds to
student organizations.

Under the present system the
Allocations Committee submits
its recommendations to the So-
cial Commission which then re-
views the proposal. If the com-
mission finds it unacceptable it
can send it back to Allocations. If
the commission finds it unac-
ceptable it can send it back to
allocations. If the commission
does not approve the proposal the
second time. it can override the

Activities

On Sunday the Allocations Com-
mittee proposed to the Student
Association (SA) Commissioners
that this years activities fee be
raised from $8 to $14. The four
commissioners met yesterday to

consider the proposal. The results»

of the meeting were not available

as the Pitt News went to press.
However. in an interview. Den-

nis Concilla. Programs Commis-

‘ sioner. expressed surprise at the

amount of the proposal.

Concilla said that the Alloca-
tions Committee explained its
proposal to be a result of the
large budgets turned in by the So-
cial Commission. which is seek-
ing to have a $3 standardization on

all concert tickets. and by such.

organizations as thd Owl and the
Pitt News.

Lenny Klavonic, Social Com-
missioner, said that he disap-
proved of the proposal and indi-
cated that he would oppose such
a large raise.

An additional reason for the-

proposed activities fees increase
is a recent decision by the School

Fee Hike

of General Studies to withdraw its
support of daytime activities.

Director of Student Activities
Bill Markus said that it had been
decided at a recent meeting of
Dr. Steele Gow. Dean of the
School of General Studies; Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky. the chairman
of the General Studies Cabinet.
and himself. that it was unfairifor
night students to be forced to sup-
port activities from which they
derived no benefits.

From now on, he explained, the
school will collect its own fees
and gear programs to the needs
of its part-time students.

“Before. $2 out of every $4 col-
lected went into the SA coffers.
The other $2 was kept by the Gen-
eral Studies Cabinet." Markus
said. "Now. no monies will go to
daytime programs." ’

The nchool will now set up con-
tractual agreements for activ-
ities it considers useful for its
students. For instance. Markus
explained General Studies might
have a contract with the Pitt
News to provide the paper for its
students.

Those present at the meeting
failed to devise a new system of
checks and balances.

BUDGETARY SAFEGUARDS

Markus outlined four proposed

budgetary safeguards discussed
at the meeting:

1) An audit of the books each

, term. The idea of an additional

monthly review was also suggest-
ed. The Allocations Committee
would check the budgets and ex-
penditures of various activities to
see how spending related to the
original budgetary submission :

2) A program of bonded signa-
tories for the protection of stu-

dents signing for funds:

3) A publication of budgetary
revisions  and expenditures of
each organization in the Pitt News
each month. This was proposed so
that students could see how their
money is being spent, and

4) A requirement that .all
monies be allocated by budget
request.

Attendants at the meeting. in-
cluding Vice Chancellor Bernard
Kobosky. Dan McFadden and
Markus. also set up a process by
which the amount of the Student
Activities Fee can be changed.

After the Allocations Commit-
tee has finished budgetary hear-
ings, Markus explained, it will be
able to recommend to the four
commissioners that there be a
change in the activities fee, if it
is necessitated by‘ a lack or an ex-
cess of funds.

“Following this." Markus said.
"the commissioners would set
up two open hearings for students
to debate the proposal. After this
process the commissioners would
submit a proposal to Vice Chan-
cellor Kobosky. who would have

. the final say on the proposal.“

Markus added that only one
change in the price of activities
will be permitted each academic
year (three terms). Further-
more. a fee will have to be approv-
ed no later than April 1 if it is to
be enacted by September.

MARKUS REMAINS ADVISOR

At themeeting. the right of the
SA to pick its own advisor was
also discussed. Recently. Social
Commissioner Lenny Klavonic
and Committees Commissioner
Wade Lawson had expressed a
desire to choose a replacement
for Markus. who. they felt. lack-
ed the time to function as SA ad-
visor. —

 FASC Extends Departmental  if 

Credit Limit From 40 To 60

_ The Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences Council (FASCJ approved
a motion Thursday limiting all de-
partmental credit requirements
to 40 and extending the number of
credits a student may take in one
department from 40yo 60.

Presented by the Undergrad-
uate Cabinet and endorsed by the
College of Arts and Sciences Coun-
cil (CASC). the -motion will en-
able those students whose depart-
mental requirements have limit-
ed them to take more specializ-

ed courses within their major

areas.
According to an FASC member

the decision does not require the

approval of the FAS.

A possible side effect of the ac.
tion was pointed out by Assistant
Professor Alfred Moye of the
Chemistry Department. He said
that four-hour labs are now

awarded only one credit to keep

 

students within‘, the 40-credit lim-
it. Mike ﬂout, a member of the
Undergraduate Cabinet, said that
the reform may lead to increas-
ed credit for labs.

The new ruling could also help
those students in the Studio Arts.
Music. and Theater Arts depart-
ments applying’ for graduate_
study. Due to the 40-credit limit.
these students often had to com-
plete remedial work before being
accepted for graduate school.

The motion would enable these
students to take more courses in
their majors without jeopardizing
the status of students not desiring
such a high degree of major con-
centration. since the departments
could not require more than 40
credits.

‘ CASC DELIBERATIONS

The CASC which met Friday

proposed changes aimed to in-

crease the options available with-  L
in the CAS and, for some students, A

shorten the time required in un-
dergraduate studies to» receive‘,
the bachelors degree. ‘

The CASC also recommendieydi 
that Peter Longini, instructor of‘

Speech 99: Practicum in Radio,
urge his students to opt for cred-
it/no entry in this course-.»Lon—‘
gini has requested changing the -
grading system permanently

 

from letter grades. He was asked 9

to return after the Fall term, to
report if the credit/no entry,
grade should be mandatory.

The Undergraduate Cabinets
proposal to extend the time on the
credit no/entry period from two
weeks to three weeks was not de-
cided at Friday's meeting. It
was agreed that this proposal
needed further consideration. .

CAS Council Plots "Major” Changes

(Editor's note: the following
is the text of a recommendation
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences Council dealing with the
alteration of graduation require-
ments concerning a major sub-
ject.) ‘

PROPOSED REGULATIONS

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences offers threeitypes of pro-
gram leading to an undergradu-
-ate degree. In the first type. the
student specializes in a defin-
ite area of studies at the under-
graduate level; in the second
type. the student uses formal
post-baccalaureate studies to
satisfy a significant part of the
bachelor's degree requirements;
in the third type. the student
devotes his or her entire under-
graduate career to acquiring a
broadly based acquaintance
with the fields of liberal study.

DEGREES WITH MAJORS

Departmental Major: A stu-
dent may choose to specialize
in one of the departments of the
FAS. Students electing a “de-
partmental major” follow the
specific requirements of the de-
partment they have chosen. De-
partments must require a mini-
mum of 24 departmental credits,
and may not normally require
more than 40, though students
may take up to 60 credits with-
in a department.

Students must also take at
least 12 credits in a related
field specified by the depart-
ment of their major. Regula-
tions concerning major work in
each department will be found
at the beginning of the course
listings for that department.

Students normally select their
major department during their
fourth term of full-time study.
A student who meets the ma-
jor requirements of two de-
partments may declare. and
have recorded on his transcript.
a double major.

Self-Designed Major: The self-
designed major provides an op-
tion for students who have defin-
able areas_ of interest for which
no established program exists.
It combines the major and re-
lated area into a program of
study containing at least 36,
credits. It must coordinate con-
centrated study in at least three
departments or schools and must
provide the breadth and depth
consistent with an Arts and
Sciences major. I

Students normally plan a self-
designed major during their
fourth or fifth term of full-
time study but under exception-
al circumstances can do so later.
A detailed proposal. a list of
courses and a letter of sponsor-
ship from a faculty member
should be sent to the Dean of
the College for approval.

Joint Major: Two or more
departments may collaborate in
a joint program of studies, in
which students take courses con-
stituting a meaningful area of
learning and research although

not satisfying the major re-
quirements of any single de-
partment.

A joint major must include

at least 36 required credits.
and may not equal more -than
60 credits. Students who satisfy
the requirements of a joint. ma-

approved by Dean.

POST-BACCALAUREATE
COMBINATION DEGREES

Graduate School Option: Stu-
dents who have completed 90
credits toward a College De-
gree, have satisfied the Distribu-
tion of Studies requirement, and
have been accepted as degree
candidates by the Graduate Fa-
culty of any department in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
at the University may receive a
bachelor’s degree upon success-
ful completion of the regular
first year of graduate studies.

A student entering this pro-
gram must be enrolled as regu-
lar graduate student. and the
Chairman of his department
must give the Dean of the Col-
lege a written statement certify-

_ing completion of the first year

of graduate work. but no under-
graduate major will be required.

Professional School Option:

Students who have completed 90
credits in the College of Arts
and Sciences, have satisfied the
Distribution of Studies require-
ment, and have been accepted
into the post-baccalaureate pro-
gram of any professional school
at the University of Pittsburgh,
may receive a bachelor’s degree
upon successful completion of
the first year of the graduate
professional program of that
school.

Such students will not be re-
quired to complete an under-
graduate major: but they will
not be allowed to count as part
of their 90 Credits any "non-
CAS" credits (e.g. those award-
ed for courses numbered in the
90's or 1905. those given in
other schools of the Univer-
sity).

NON-MAJOR DEGREE

Liberal Studies Option:
dents who find the most valu-

able aspect of their College
career to be the exploration of

Stu-

new fields of learning may earn
a Bachelor of Arts degree in
Liberal Studies. To receive
such a degree, the student must
earn 120 credits with an -overall
average of 2.00 or better.

He must satisfy the Distribu-
tion of' Studies requirement.
and earn at least 30 credits in
upper division or graduate
courses offered by the F AS.
except those numbered in the
180‘s or 1905.

A student in Liberal Studies
will be assigned an advisor in
the Advising Center. unless he
finds a faculty member who is
willing to serve as his advisor.

The choice of this program,
may be made as early as the
fourth term of study. and must
normally be made no later than
the term preceding the term in
which the student expects to
graduate. In exceptional cases
a student may elect a Liberal
Studies degree during his last
term.

Academics, Community Action Ahead

Gil Sees Slow Change

— Gil: Realistic, academic approach.

(Editor's note: Joseph R. Gil
and Michael A. Corletti were re-
cently named Superintendent of
Campus Security Services and
Assistant Superintendent of Cam-
pus Security Services, respec-
tively. The Pitt News interview-
ed both men in order to discov-
er what direction campus sec-
urity would take under their
leadership.)

by CAROLE COVAL

New Superintendent of Camp-
us Security Services. Joseph R.
Gil foresees no major restruc-
turing of operation within this
department.

Gil does predict that the P01-
ice department will change how-
ever. "gradually. as a result of
changing environment. and in re-

sponse to those problems which

we react to."

Gil intends to remain in com-
munication with the Legal
Awareness Committee (LAC) of
the Student Association. Accord-
ing to an agreement made be-
tween former Superintendent Ro-
bert Merritt and LAC co-ordin-
ator Bob Ging, Campus Secur-
ity Police phone Legal Aware-
ness after an arrest has been
made.

Gil explained why the Drug
Identification program was shel-
ved. The program initially plan-
ned to aid students by analyzing
drug compounds for toxicity and
thereby prevent students from
experimenting with unknown
doses. Gil said that. although

Campus Police could test and
notify students of toxicity, they
would have been forced to re-
port on non-toxic drugs also.

“That would be like giving the
Campus Police Good Housekeep-
ing Seal of Approval on certain
drugs." he said. “I'm afraid that
doesn‘t parallel the departments
objectives."

Besides aiming to “foster a
better situation .with City Pol-
ice,” Gil plans to involve his
staff in the academic line of
police work.

“The School of General Stu-
dies offers valuable Police Sci-
ence courses. These, along with
the department's own training
programs, help to give the offi-
cer a realistic, as well as aca-
demic approach to the problems
of an urban university,” he said.

“Heretofore. police work was
not considered as educational ex-
perience. With the initiation of
the CLEP test. which gauges
experience in a similar way as
does College Entrance Examina-
tions, we can involve even more
officers in the academic world."

According to Gil. the security
force is also involving itself in
a community action program to
participate more fully with the
Oakland Community in attempt-
ing to solve the variables which
alienate community members
from police.

‘Gil, who was previously Dir-
ector of Security and Safety at

Carlow College, assumed the role.

of Assistant Superintendent at
Pitt in August of 1970, when
Merritt became Superintendent.

Merritt was named Opera-
tions Manager of the Physical
Plant Division.

The Finance Office of the
University is cancelling all
budget balances for items
other than salaries effective
May 1 in order to make a
small dent in the University's
anticipated financial deficit.

In addition, the Univer-
sity has put a freeze on all

non-faculty hiring.

More, Better Training 
C0rletti’s First Target

Corletti: Proper training key.

by RON LOZOWSKI

Michael A. Corletti. recently
appointed Assistant Superinten-
dent of Campus Security Servic-
es. said that his primary aim is
to strive for a professional force.
with more and better training
for patrolmen.

In an interview with the Pitt
News, Corletti said that effec-
tive security “hinges on proper
training: everything else then
falls into place." He pointed out
that many members of the force
are ‘currently enrolled in law
enforcement courses offered by
the University, and that Camp-
us Security also provides special
training sessions for its staff.

According to Corletti, the pri-
mary purpose of campus secur-
ity is to provide for the safety
and welfare of students. “Be-
cause we are a private unit, be-
cause this is a university, our
main purpose is to protect the
student.”

He also stressed that protec-
tion of property is another im-
portant duty of the force.

Corletti said that proper ad-
ministration of these duties re-

quires cooperation on the part
of students. Corletti described
the relationship between students
and force members. especially
patrolmen. as good. The Assis-
tant attributes this rapport to the
fact that patrolmen have been
able to relate to students:
“They'll bother to listen. to hear
out complaints. "‘

Overall, Corletti feels that the
campus security picture is im-
proving. He noted that “we
haven’t had nearly as many as-
sault and battery cases as in the
past."

Corletti’ remarked that the
force has "taken steps to insure
student safety." pointing to the
“beat" system instituted on
campus about a year ago. The
Assistant feels that safety has
also been enhanced by the addi-
tion of patrol cars between 4
p.m. each day and the following
morning. I

Although he has had nine
years‘ experience with munici-
pal police forces. the new Assis-
tant finds campus security work
much more challenging. “Being
with campus security gives an
opportunity to View things in a
different light.“ said Corletti.

Corletti explained that a mun-
icipal police force can operate
only from a certain angle, with
the choice of either placing sus-
pects under arrest or “forget-
ting,” incidents. The campus
force, however, offers more op-
portunities to help students. The
campus officer has the added op-
tion of steering students toward
counseling help, if this is seen
as beneficial.

  Survey Reveals    
  Staid Alumni

With gusto, alumni cheer the Panthers go on to victory. They
gulp a postgame Iron City at an Oakland pub. reminiscing between
T‘ swallows. Then. whistling “Hail to Pitt.“ they return to suburbia.

Occasionally, they read about “dear old Pittsburgh" in the . Alumni
«Tirﬂes.,'Perhaps they even scan "the weekly homilies of Professor Law-
:* rence Lee in the Pittsburgh Press.“

 yflBput, by and large, alumni are sheltered from the realities of Pitt
; today.-

   

  

  

Ag  ‘Do alumni understand that a new consciousness has emerged at
,;.this_ University? A recent poll, published by the Alumni Times. sug-
, I gests. that -they do not.

  

 ’ According to the survey, 65 per cent of alumni oppose "a special
admissions policy for students from disadvantagedbackgrounds <e.g.
fgblacks and the poor l." H ‘ i

  

 - Is it really necessary to point out that a uniform admissions po-
ilicy is implicitly racist‘? That College Boards are culturally biased‘?
,-‘That standard admissions criteria discriminate against talented. dili-
f,’gent youths raised in squalor‘, while favoring youths fortunate enough
to be raised in a pleasantneighborhood by educated parents‘?

i; , According to the survey, 53.5 per cent of alumni disagree that “stu-
; dents should become more involved in local affairs; should be more
- active  the community.” Only 39.2’ per cent favor more involvement.

. : ~ Again,‘ is it necessary to argue that the University cannot remain
-lanlivory tower divorced from society? That concerned students and
. facultyicannot sit stoically and observe de facto segregation and urban

decay, without applying what they have learned 1’ * .
“A -A Such views are not espoused merely by “misguided” radicals
‘and "‘mind'less" freaks. The new Dean of the School of General Stud-
.lies;2?J. Steele Gow Jr.. recently described the “college as crucible“ A

coiiceptwas “a lot of malarkey.“ According to Gow. “Society is the
“reai crucible." Gow foresees a greater integration of work and study
[at Pitt. ‘ , .

":If the results of the poll are accurate. alumni are distressingly out

of? touch with the pulse of this campus. Perhaps they prefer memories‘
"of an old university to visions of a progressive one.
But according to Bernard Koperek. director of Development and
':A'lu‘mni Affairs, the Alumni Times survey was not methodologically
,_.. sound. A new poll is currently being prepared. This time. reliable re-
’ sults are predicted.

  

  

if  Unfortunately, if the poll is inaccurate, the damage has already
been done.—Published in the Alumni Times. the poll somehow found its
‘. way into the Pittsburgh Press.

, u If the poll is inaccurate, the Alumni Affairs office is guilty of ir-
4* responsibility. It should not have been published. if it distorted the
. actual views of alumni. _
 V If, on the other hand, the survey comes close to the truth. the

SA Resumes, Thinking e

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

After a series of quick. irrational statements
and counter-statements. and ‘vitriolic charges and
counter-charges that left usually apathetic stu-
dents appalled, the four Student Association (SA)
commissioners have apparently decided to sit down
to think and talk rationally about new student gov-
ernment programs and decisions before putting
them into‘ action.

In the past two weeks two of the commissioners.
Lenny Klavonic, ‘Social Commissioner. and Wade
Lawson. Committees Commissioner. have kept us
reporters at the Pitt News busy reporting many
exciting events.

Among them were -1) Proposed hike in the Stu-
dent Activities fee; 2) A decision to pay them-
selves salaries. retroactive to February and contin-
gent on their productivity as viewed by themselves;
and 3) An attempt to replace Bill Markus. the SA
advisor albecause he did not have enough time to
devote to SA activities, and b) Because he present-
ed a "daddy" attitude and more often than not dis-
approvdd of their boyish shenanigans.

Friday, however, the four commissioners sat
down with administrators and made some real-
istic proposals for implementing their ideas.

First.‘ they developed a process by which Activ-
ities Fees ca_n be raised. if and only if members of
the Allocations Committee first identify a need for
such an action. ‘

Second. they began working on a system of safe-
guards which would prevent students from having
their “taxes“ used irresponsibly and the Univer-
sity from being faced with any legal suits for inap-
propriateactions. ‘ . r .. . no _

Third, they settled the advisor iiuestioh” to every-

one’s ,,satisfaction., The ,comm'issioner‘s recognized. A

 

      
 

. the U_!IiYel‘§_ity’s-rigvht to-‘try and protect, its own w '

interests by choosing the SA ‘advisor. Yet, they
made and won the point that each; commissioner
needs a separate administrator to work with him.

Attendants at the meeting came out of the con-
ference room in the Student Affairs Office smiling.
Markus reported that the meeting had been ami-
able and that everyone was in agreement. Klav-
onic and Dennis Concilla, Programs Commission-
er. expressed similar points of view.

I was delighted to see the commissioners’ re-
turn to rationality. And I applaud the various pro-
posals they made at Friday’s meeting. Having been
a‘ staunch supporter of the commissioners. I was
one of those dismayed at the apparent lack of
thoughtfulness and responsibility in many of their
decisions.

Concilla admitted after the meeting that some of
the recent decisions made had been “hasty.” I
only hope that they remember their hastiness when
they sit down to settle the salary issue.

Concilla assured me that they will not vote them-
selves guaranteed salaries. They will be paid ac-
cording to productivity and the amount of hours put
in at the SA office each month. He also told me that
they had not made up their minds as to whether
their salaries would be retroactive.

The statement made me happier than any other .

I heard following that meeting. The commissioners
took office without expecting salaries. There‘s no
good reason to expect remuneration for the past
services. Hopefully. they will display responsibil-
ity and rationality when they make their decision.

Perhaps it is a little old- fashioned and overly-
idealistic to hope the commissioners have scruples
and morals before they vote themselves unjustified

I retréoaictive salares. But becausegl have been~a
staunch SA supporter. and hope to continue V to .

beone. Ihave faith they will do just that. L '

    Washington, D.C. -

VS. Virginia Joyce

."The District of Columbia vs. Virginia Joyce." The bailiff gave
the cue and I moved to stand before Judge Revercomb with my legal
counselor—a mod looking young man who worked for the Federal Trade
Commission. It was 5:30 a.m.. Wednesday. Sixteen hours before I had
been one of 2.700 demonstrators who had refused a police order to
vacate the Tenth St. thorofare outside the Justice Department.

I was charged with violation of police lines. a misdemeanor slight-
ly more grave than a traffic violation. But. despite the relative mild-
ness of my offense, I had been fingerprinted. photographed with a num-
ber under my chin and incarcerated for part of the time in a cell so
crowded that -the only sitting room was underneath the long wooden
benches in the cold. cement floor.

The judge read my rights. In contrast to other magistrates, he was
“tough.“ “The bail law will apply to my courtroom.“ he insisted at the
outset. explaining that those failing to appear for their trials were li-
able for a year in jail and a fine of $1,000. Ther could be no “mitigat-
ing circumstances." He set $100 bail at ten per cent and my trial date
for July 2.

Between May 3 and 5, nearly 12,000 anti-war demonstrators un-
derwent the “process,” making legal history and providing the most
quotable example of the success of May Day in Washington. While
armchair observers, notably the media, predicted that the actions,
“as just another series of demonstrations,” would fail to at-
tract numbers, the American populace was confronted with an anti-
war movement that has steadily 7
grown in mobility and in its
-willingness to couple a physical
commitment to the intellectual.

Although government spokes-
men still attempt to discredit
the movement as a “lunatic
fringe.“ those they “represent"
are moving into political solid-
arity with the activists more
than ever before. A year after
Kent State. the Detroit City Coun-
cil passed the Peoples‘ Peace
Treaty. 2.000 federal employdes
amassed at a May 5 anti-war
rally and several Congressmen
and women. including Bella Abzug
of New York and Paul McCloskey
of California. gave themselves up
for arrest voluntarily.

   

. And now. the crucial common denominator of the governments
argument—the need to redeem the “sacrifice" of 50.000 American
lives lost in Vietnam—has been publicly pierced by the massive turn-
out of the Vets during the Dewey Canyon III operation and the revela-
tion that one—half of the lower echelon D. C. based troops have signed
the Peace Treaty.

Without doubt, May»Day was a success, both in the political im-
plications of the action and in its stated objective—“to effect maximum
psychological dislocation of the government.” The nation’s capitol was
in a state of maritial law for the three days of the offensive. Troops
and huge numbers of police lined every major/thorofare and circle,
slowing down the movement of traffic nearly as well as could the anti-
war demonstrators".

The sweeping arrests were so massive and indiscriminate that
anyone waling the streets was risking arrest. A federal court ruled
Wednesday morning that 1.800 persons jailed without a specific charge
had been arrested "illegally“ and ordered their release.

May Day was an important learning experience both. for the dem-
onstrators and the people of Washington. D. C. The city was a war zone
for three days and for that brief period. we had a small indication of
the fear and instability marking a militarized Vietnam.

May Day was the beginning of a new chapter in the anti-war move-
ment. Our efforts will not rest with the experience in Washington. We
will continue to lobby for an end to the war through implementation of
the Peoples‘ Peace Treaty in our communities.

New Concept Sparks Hopes

by JERRY WEBSTER
Staff Columnist

Recently a new way of teach-
ing and learning. the Open Class-
room. has provoked quite a bit of
interest in both the University
and the community. The num-
ber of Open Classrooms in both
private and public schools in the
city is rapidly increasing and will
probably be. in the Fall. 1971.
double the number of Open Class-
rooms in 1970.

The School of Pittsburgh is tak-
ing ‘interest in the Open Class-
room and is encouraging teachers
to open their classrooms by offer-
ing credit for participation in
Open Classroom workshops.

During the Spring Term. 1971.
the department of curriculum and
supervision in the School of
Education will inaugurate an
Open Classroom Workshop. a
three credit coursd open to both
undergrads ahp grads.

The workshop will deal with in-
troducing activities in all areas
and will be team-taught in an
open atmosphere. Due to the rap-
id student registration for the
course, Dr. Brad Seeger, depart-
ment chairman, says the course
will definitely be offered next
year.

Dr. David Campbell. instruc-
tor of Foundations of Education.
presented a proposal for a com-
plete Open Classroom teacher
training program to Dr. Paul Ma-
soner. dean of the School of Edu-
cation. Dr. Masoner‘s response
was positive. and hopefully in the
near future undergrads will be
able to train for Open Classroom.

What is an Open Classroom‘?

It’s hard to define the Open
Classroom, for every teacher and
every class group will act differ-
ently in an open situation. It’s best
to start with what it isn’t. It isn’t
traditional; no rows of desks, no
lessons, no assignments, no
homework, no detentions, no in-
timidation. It isn’t chaos; no
fighting, no destrictuon.

The Open Classroom is basi-
cally that situation where stu-
dents and teachers come togeth-
er to learn about the world in
which they live. They mingle as
human beings with, greater or
lesser sophistication. not as su-
periors and subordinates.

They take advantage of all the
learning resources available.
especially concrete things — for
botany you grow plants. for math
you add bottle caps and use play
money. The central interest is in
skills for living. not facts.

The teacher is still a very im-

  
    

‘ nets.

    
     
     
     
  

portant person. She must be able
to arrange the classroom and dis-
card activities that are either use-
less or uninteresting. She must be
able to interact maturely with her
students, sensitive to each child's
learning needs and progress and
capable to mediate 1'5/tle squab-
bles that might arise. She is no
longer playing the school marm
role——she can lose her temper
like anyone else, and be respected
for it.

The day in a primary grade
open classroom begins about half
an hour before school does. Ev-
eryone begins to work upon arriv-
al and continues after the bell.
often without the teacher. Some-
one may bring something that
would otherwise have been rele-
gated to “show and tell" which he
is proudly exhibiting.

An interested group gathers and
the teacher joins in a heated dis-
cussion of frogs or crabs or cater-
pillars. Otherwise the children
will move around the different
areas of interest in the room.

The math area has things to
count, flash cards, number
games, play money, cuisinaire
rods, measuring cups and per-
haps an old adding machine.

The science corner is filled with
plants. animals. motors. mag-
batteries and other "sci-
ence“ things that children are in-
terested in.

The arts and crafts area is one
of the busiest. Children are
busily drawing. painting and glue-
ing. Someone is always running
for the teacher to help caption a
picture—and excellent reading
vocabulary exercise.

The reading corner is the quiet
area of the room and has book-
shelves of story books and the
stories that the children have
written themselves. There are

old sofa to curl up on.

From time to time the teacher. »

may take a small group aside_to
read or go over arithmetic skills.

She may also initiate class activ-— --
ity, or the pupils may start some- 
thing themselves—singing, ‘a play”

or reading out loud.

ment. the high school, etc.

An upper grades open‘ class- -'

room would be much the same,

though students would be pursuing ' 
more sophisticated activities and.

using greater skill. A great va_-

riety of materials can be_used.
Ten and ll-year-olds would..enjo'y*
making films or documentary 

tapes of class activities, content-,‘

running experiments.

‘At first the Open Classroom is 
a little disturbing. It lacks the 

desk row order and quiet that

a person is accustomed to: ‘It‘s, 

noisy and constantly busy.

The Open Classroom is a place

for children. Today the school, the
home. the church and the Little
League or dance class, are _'all
adult places in which children are
expected to act
ways. The only time they have to‘

be children is in the little free‘. _
time they have between the school "

bell and homework.

It may disturb adults to‘ turn‘,-
the schools into places for chi1- -1.
dren.‘but it‘s the only way for‘

children to grow into healthy

adults.

-Fall Career Sessions

take place in February.

Developed in direct response to
expressed student need. the sem-
inars bring together profession-
als from many fields and interest-
ed students to present opportun-
ities for small group discussions.

-“Given the pessimistic econom-
ic situation,” said Fakles, “it is
more important than ever before
for college students to learn as
much as possible about vocational
opportunities.”

She added that one of the best
ways to learn is by participating
in the preliminary planning of the
seminars which will begin soon.

“The Career Seminar series is
operated by active. concerned stu-
dents in conjunction with the pro-
fessional' staff of the University
Counseling Center." said Fakles.
"The seminars will be successful
and worthwhile to the extent that
they are developed and planned
by the students they"are intended
to help.

the seminars should ‘contact Te-

ter. 205 SU. ext. 7265.

Budget Checks Mapped

of the various safeguards propos-
ed by the meeting. However, he
said he could see a problem with
the proposal which would only
make funds available after a bud-
get was proposed.

He explained that this could
make it difficult for organizations
to obtain funds early enough to
sign up a big-name performer.

"It kind of messed me up for
entertainment." he admitted. ‘-‘If
I have to wait for the date of allo-
cations disbursements there will
be no need for me to try for big-
name groups.“

He admitted that the proposals
were all necessary for the protec-
tion of the students. _

Commissioner Dennis (‘oncilla
said that he also approved of
the various proposals. He added.
however. that the commissioners
really had no choice but to ap-
prove of them.

“If the University told us they
couldn't take the risk of collecting
our fees and told us to incorpor-
ate and collect the fees ourselves.
we would never be able to collect
the money." he said.

“I also think.“.he said. that the
University has a definite right to
insure itself against suit as long
as it is legally responsible for the
fees.“

Sayco spins Yo-yos, Yarns

 

 

Champ Seeks Yo-yo’s Return

YO-YO artist Larry Sayco twirls a trick or two in the Pitt News office.

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

The word "yo-yo.“ says Rhode
Island businessman Larry Sayco.
stems from a Philippine dialect
phrase meaning "come back.“

If Sayco has his way. that is ex-
actly‘ what the popularity of yo-
yos will do. _

Sayco. world champion yo.yo
artist for nine consecutive years
through the fifties and sixties.
now makes yo-yos his vocation as
well as his avocation. His factory
in Rhode Island manufactures
about 100.000 yo-yos each year.

For the past four years, Sayco
has crusaded across the nation
on behalf of the yo-yo, trying to
“rekindle the flame” that burned
out in 1965.

In that year. the Duncan compa-
ny. giant of the yo-yo industry.
folded. Duncan all but monopol-
ized the business: the company
even hada copyright on the name
"yo-yo." Alter Duncan collapsed.
the yo-yos popularity nosediyed.

"Children were not interested.“
said Sayco of the" yo-_\'o's decline.
“but it was a matter of poor man-
agement." '

Sayco, an unsuccessful night
club comic, feels that given the

' proper publicity, yo-yos could
soon be dizzily spinning again.

"People always ask me.“ said
Sayco. "are yo-yos going to re-
vive. I think they will. Whereever
I go. people line up to see me dem-
onstrate. These aren't children
-l‘m talking about. theyre stu-
dents." ‘

Sayco's yo-yo wizadry has en-
abled him to travel and perform
in 25 different countries over
the past 20 years. Some of his ex-
periences must have causediSay—
co to wonder if being stand up
comic mightn‘t have been more
secure.

In Cuba, he ‘was shot at by_ Fidel
Castro's troops. In Peru, he was
taken into custody when he slip-
ped the President a yo-yo luring a
handshake. The President thought
it was a hand gernade.

In Guatemala. a man approach-
ed Sayco on behalf of his em-
ployer and asked him to demon-
strate his skills with the yo-yo.
Sayco. relaxing at the time. po-
litely told him to wait a bit. The
man repeated his request and
Sayco politely repeated his reply.
After the third request. Sayco po-
litely but firmly directed the man
to tell his boss to "go to hell."

The next morning. a uniformed.
armed guard appeared at Saycos
hotel room with a message. Say-
co. it seems. had sent the Presi-

dent of Guatemala to perdition.

A

Sayco was allowed 24 hours to find
the nearest border.

The only things Sayco has miss-
ed during his extensive globetrot-
ting are Africa and marriage. Of
the latter, Sayco laughs. “I guess
with all the moving around I do,
I just don't have time for that.”

Sayco began tossing yo-yos when
he was 14. He was offered jobs
by yo-yo firms but preferred a ca-
reer in show business. A brief cir-
cuit of some tough night clubs con-
vinced the would-be entertainer
that as a comic he made a great
yo-yoer. He feels. however. that
yo-yoing is not far removed from
show business.

“In_both. you get on television.
you're before the public. and you
show off.“ \

Sayco can and does show off
more than 100 tricks with the yo-
yo. Among’ his most challenging.
he lists the “Lindy Loop" and "Yo-
yo Limbo." In “Yo—yo Limbo."
Sayco loops a yo-yo with each
hand while lying nearly flat on his
back.

   You can afford it while _ _
you’re still young enough to enjoy it.  

 

 

Having the want is one thing. Having the
wherewithal is another. The trouble with being
young is that all too often you have the one
without the other.

But the 1971 MG Midget is something else again.
Here is a true sports car for under $2500*——
the lowest price you can pay for the real thing.

In this case the real thing includes a race-
winning 1275 c.c. engine. Racing-type rack—and—
pinion steering (2.33 turns lock to lock) for cool,
crisp driving. Heavy—duty suspension for

superb road—hugging. Disc brakes up front for
straight—line, non—fade stops. Twin reclining
bucket seats. And full sports car instrumentation
with an electric tach.

Which only goes to show that, even though MG
has been engineering sports cars for over 40
years, there’s no generation gap. For the name

If the Studio Theatres produc-
tion -this past weekend of Shock of
Recognition and Crawling Arnold

1- is in’ any way reflective of the

quality of Pitt's spring drama pro-
gram, I think we ought to all find
a nice quiet retreat and emerge
only when we are certain that fall
has arrived.

From the overly exaggerated
.[Chaplinesque acting of Ron Sopy-
la. to the sluggish impotence of
‘Bruce Abrams, the entire evening
“was aconfrontation of incongru-
ent effects. Sopyla would have
been quite at home in an old Three

- Stooges movie, and Abrams would

-not have stood out in a geriatrics
ward. Combine this with two one-
act plays which are basically con-

I . ventiona_l and trite. add an air of

banality. and you have a rather
oppressive evening.
The stiff. almost paralytic

movement of Soypla and his ef-
feminate manner was so overdone

’ that it completely outweighed

and defeated the basic humor

The overall result of this Hu-

Insipid ‘Shock’, Weak “Arnold” Flounder

_(what little there was) in Shock
of Recognition. The play itself. a
portion of Robert Anderson‘s You
Know I Can’t Hear You When the
Water’s Running, is the story of a
confrontation between Herb Mill-
er (Sopyla). a producer. and a
playwright (Abrams).

Barnstable is trying to convince
Miller that a scene in his latest

play in which a man walks out.

of the bathroom nude, will not of-
fend but appeal to the “average
man.” Miller argues that a man’s
“thing flapping in the breeze” is
disgusting ‘ (There is finally a
great revelation when Miller ad-
mits it’s called a penis!). The
whole intended realistic effect is
lost due to Sopylafs neo-Tiny Tim
exaggeration. The realistic set
and costume may as well been
left out.

Brucd Abrams as "Barnstable"
was totally unconvincing and in
no way resembled any acceptable
notion of playwrights.

Francis Roefaro who played
Richard Pawling. an. actor to be
cast in the nude scene. could have

a surplus of common sense
knowledge rather than an in
depth analysis of kinertics. Such

statements as “men react very
strongly when their personal
space or territory is invaded”
or “sooner or later every boy
learns that touching a girl at the
wrong moment may turn her off
abruptly” hardly merit a five-star
profundity.

By pouring too much of too lit-
tle into his corporeal text. Fast
leaves the reader slightly hung
over on just what it is he wishes
to emphasize. The book has an e'v
anescent_ quality because all
the important points disappear.

Interesting ideas on how differ-
ent cultures handle space. or if
there are universal gestures and
expressions which communicate a
meaning to all other humans re-
gardless of race. creedfcolor or
culture should have provided the
axis for development. Perhaps
body language is just too touchy
a subject for Fast to handle
extensively.

Compared to another Human
Potential Book. Sense Relaxation
by Bernard Gunthur. Body Lan-
guage proves an uninteresting
fizzle. Body Language is not new
and neither is Fast‘s information
on body communication. The book
deserves one non-verbal commen-
tary. Ayawn. 2

been very funny had it not been
for the inane farcical void al-
ready created by the time of his
appearance. His humorous inef-
fective manner thus. rather than
adding to the show. only heighten-
ed its oppressive insanityj

Helen Lipchey (Dorothy), who
has shown. herself to be a fine
actress in other productions, was
also a victim of the runaway still-
iness. Her pauses were too long,
her facial expressions unreal,
and her whole movement contriv-
ed. Actually, the blocking of the
entire play was poor as charac-
ters often communicated in near
shouts from one end of the stage
to the other.

Crawling Arnold, the second
play by Jules Feiffer. was doom-
ed from the start. Ron Sopyla
again had the first speaking part.

He might as well have not even

a changed his clothes. as he por-

trayed "Mr. Enterprise“ as iden-
tical to “Herb Miller." his char-
acter in the first play. It almost
seemed like Act II of the~same

play.

Crawling Arnold is the story of
a 35-year-old man who reverts to
crawling and other childishness
in ‘his home in an attempt to reach
out against the threatening tech-
nocracy. Abrams. who played
Arnold. was again weak and un-
humorous in a part which did
have many comical lines. Sopyla.
as the neurotic father concerned
only with building "safe“ bomb
shelters did not appear in -the lat-
ter part of the play. and whatever
humor did emerge was due partly
to his obvious absence.

Chris. Wendt (Miss Sympathy)
assumed the necessary realistic
manner as the “Social Worker,”
but her blocking and movement
were poor.

Pat Golden as Millie the maid
was fine in her small part and pos-
sibly should have been cast in a
larger one.

 

The set. by Francis Roefard. ,

appeared overly spread out in
Shock but worked well in Crawl-

ing Arnold. As mentioned before. - I

it was out of step with the farcical
mood of the plays. Also the fact
that Abrams wore the same cloth-
es in both plays. seems to have
been a glaring costume mistake.

Overall. it appears that the di-
rection of Edie Naugh was poor.
and the emphasis wrongly placed.
The show did not “work.“

Pitt track coach Jim Banner
was all smiles Saturday as he
watched his first annual Pitt In-
vitational unfolding before him.
Ten schools sent 149 athletes to
the meet and more important to
Banner, there was a lot of quality
in the field.

“Schools are looking for a
-meet like this." he said. “A meet
where a school can send a couple
of its players to try to qualify
for the nationals."

In the meet. 31 Pitt athletes
combined for seven first place

finishes and a winning total of

1601/2 points. The trac.ksters relied
mainly on their running strength
for their win. while second place
Ohio University compiled its
points primarily (80) -in the field
events. -

Because of the speedy new
Tartan Track, and the consider-

I ably lower times of athletes in

the indoor season, a few stadium
records were expected to fall.

Four new records were estab-

lished in all and because of the

new facilities, two new events
that had been restructed by the
previous facilities were also
added.

Smittie Brown continued his
torrid pace in setting the first of
the four records in the 440 re-
lay.. Brown ran the 440 in 47.4
eclipsing the old stadium record.
set by John Woodruff way back
in 1937. by .3 seconds. '

Mike Mosser, a constant
thorn in Pitt’s side, continued his
fine running at the stadium.
Mosser’s 4:06.9 mile replaced
the old record (4:09.8) 10 years
ago by a Penn Stater.

“Mosser is a fine athlete." ad-
mired Banner. in the indoor in-

\

  

mind when he stepped up to the microphone on Saturday
afternoon. Standing next to him on the sidelines of the
football field was Chancellor Wesley Posvar. It was Ban-
ner’s job to kick off the finals portion of Pitt’s first an-
nual Invitational Track Meet. .

“The boys have been working hard and I’m sure they’ll
put on a fine show,” Banner began. “We have with us

the man who has made these fine facilities possible. Doc-

tor Litchfield.  _ ‘

Everyone in the stadium was aware of the Coach‘s
mistake except Banner himself. He was pulled aside by
Dr. Posvar and atthat point his embarrassment was ob-
VIOUS. ‘

“I didn’t want to-do that anyway,” Banner admitted
afterward, referring to the introductions; “I had to laugh
though. There was so much on my mind — whether ‘the
events would come off on time and what came first——that
I didn’t have a chance to think about the introductions.

. You really have to laugh at yourself at a time like that.”

From that precarious beginning, though, things seemed

to go right according to schedule. Pitt couldn’t do any-

thing wrong for the rest of the afternoon, winning the in-
vitational handily, a full 26 points ahead of Ohio Univer-
sity. I

The success of a big Invitational trackmeet can mean
a lot to a school. The athletes return to their hometowns
and spread the word. The t—shirts that represented 2nd and
3rd place prizes add to the advertising campaign. But the
road to a successful meet is not a short one.

“We sent invitations out last fall,” ‘Banner explained.
“We sent out about 100 and we received 20 acceptances,
eithertentative or definites. We were hoping for a field
of about 10 to 12 schools. Ten showed up.”

“A meet like this takes about five years to build. I
had one in high school that took six years and I had 40
teams participating. The important thing is that the schools
send quality men.”

Playing the role of. meet co-ordinator made the invi-
tational, more-or-less, Banner’s show. He was very pleased
with the way things turned out. He indicated that all the
coaches raved about the facilities and many of the compe-
titors couldn’t say enough about the new synthetic track.

Banner on the other hand was very pleased with the
turn-out, both on the field and off.

“I was glad to see so many people in the stands." said
Banner of the crowd of 600 who showed up for the com-
petition. “I’m sure we could have'had a lot more if it
hadn’t rained on Friday. People tend to make their plans
a day in advance." P -

“On the field. the quality of the competition was very
good. St. Joseph’s brought in some really good jumpers and
LaSalle had some good men there. The people who did
come, came out with quality people."

Now that thetinvitational is an annual thing, Banner
looks forward to its growth through the years. As time goes
on, the event could take its place among the bigtrack in-_

Mosser. who had run a 4:03
mile just last week. also won the
880 yard dash. edging Walter
Hawkins of La Salle. with a
1251.8.

Pitt’s highly touted mile relay
team comprised of Dennis Schat-
zman, John Aiken, Ted Bobby and
Brown, also got into the act.
Their time of 3:l4.8 replaced the
old 3:15 mark as the stadium re-
cord. Last week in West Virgin-
ia, the team equalled the old
mark. The quartet seems headed
in the right direction in attain-
ing their goal this spring.

"If they don‘t run 3210. well
be dissappointed." said Banner.

Al Lanier. who is both triple
and high jumper. won both
events and bested the previous
long jump record by 7 inches. to
set the new mark. Pitt's answer
to Lanier. Bill Rea. was second
in both jumps.

Lanier missed reaching the 50

a mere half inch, but his 24 feet

record. _

the speedy track. Dan Kouvolo

As Mitters Split DH"

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Mike Niccols hurled the Pan-
ther mitters to an 8-3 decision
against Temple in the first game
of a doubleheader Monday while

Temple captured the second
game. 5-0. a contest loosely play-
ed by the Panthers.

"This was the worst I‘ve pit-
ched.“ commented Niccols. "It
should put my ERA over 100."
Worst performance or not. Nic-
cols pitched his way to a 4-0
season record and only upped his
earned run average of 0.85 to
an even 1.00.

He allowed three runs two of
which were earned on eight scat-
tered hits while striking out four
and giving up one base on balls.

“It wasn’t his strongest game,”

Panther hurler Mike Fedoris

faired less favorably as- he re-.

corded the loss in the second
contest. Fedoris and Panther re-
lief pitchers. Bill Shamott and
Frank Mincarelli. continued to
get behind the batters. The three

 hurlers allowed a total of five

runs on seven hits while striking
out four and giving up ten walks.

The pitchers‘ problems were
compounded when they were un-
able to receive support from
their offense and defense. Disor-
ganization in the infield permit-
ted eight Temple steals and the
Panther bats were able to scat-
ter only four hits. none of which
scoreda run.

Shortly before the end of last fall term. the

/ Black Action Society leveled charges against the

Pitt athletic department and listed several ob-
jectives in hopes of mitigating racial tension ex-
isting on the hill.

The primary goal of the group centered
around the desire ‘to have a black man named to
a high post within the administration of the
athletic department. A committee was formed to
search for qualified candidates for the office
which will be officially called ‘Executive Assist-
ant to the Athletic Director.‘

Dr. Lloyd H. Bell. Assistant Vice Chancellor
of Public Development and Public Affairs and
Director of Urban and Community Services. is
chairman“ of the committee. He views the future
appointment of a black man in the Pitt sports
administration as possible panacea to most of
the objectives of the BAS.

“We’re hoping that when the new executive
assistant is appointed, he’ll be able to get into
all of the areas necessary,” Dr. Bell stated.

Five University Officials. six athletes. and
two alumni served on Bell's committee. Their
/job was to screen prospects for the job and to
present four names to Chancellor Wesley Posvar‘

, for consideration.‘

"He (Posvar) makes it quite clear that he
doesn‘t want us to rank the men. but to just state
their qualifications." Bell continued.

1 Bell speaks about the men already ‘interview-
ed with vigor and enthusiasm. “We’ve had some
real dynamite candidates-some high powered
folks,” said Bell with pleasure. “I couldn’t see
how all of them could be turned down.”

Bell could not reveal any spceific names in-

” cluded in the search. but he conceded that for-

mer professional athletes and a present athletic
director are being considered. D

By the end of May. Bells committee will
submit the four names to Posvar and Bell hopes
that the chosen man can assume office during
the summer.

After the new man is settled into the de-
partmental structure, Bell forsees that his job
will be manifold.

In future years. Bell envisions more black men
‘being named to coching positions within the de-
partment. Also. the new executive assistant will
ensure equitable recruiting practices and en-

courage black athletes to participate in the ‘mi-

nor' sports.

Bell reiterated one candidate's reply to exemp-
lify what kind of man the committee was looking
for. “If the coaches aren’t recruiting right then
I‘ll just have to go recruitdmyself,” said the
man, according to Bell.

Although Bell is solely responsible for the
search committee. he retains close contact
with many black athletes. At present. he can
not decide about concrete progress since the
demands were presented in December.

“Nothings really changed since then." Bell
concluded. “We cant tell whether or not were
moving until the man is appointed."

Usually the low-scoring playmaker. or defensive specialist
doesn‘t receive a tremendous amount of recognition as he hustles
his way through the basketball season. In most cases. it‘s only the
coaches and his teammates that really appreciate the part he plays‘

With Bill Downes. things are a little different. With the season

Downes’ overall academic
average at Pitt was 3.83.

“Right now I don't know what

Rich Dowsell of Ohio slipped
his way to a 221 foot heave in
the javelin to edge Kouvolo.
Kouvolo’s 217 foot heave came
without a running start. Kouvolo
just stood there and armed the
throw.

Kouvolo‘s distance, or lack of
it, can best be seen in perspec-
tive to his best heave of 257
feet last year in the IC4A‘s.

Mike Schurko ran and skipped
his way to a win in the steeple-

can also be classified a record
since the steeplechase was an ini-

Shurko has now qualified for

Dave Haviland of Ohio won

Pitt‘s performance in it's own
invitational justified the smiles
that Banner was wearing. Even
though Pitt had the most contes-
tants, their 26 point victory was
very impressive.

Within five years. Banner
hopes to have one of the coun-
try's best invitationals at the stad-
ium. To do so, he hopes to at-
tract a more qualitative field
than this year.

"I felt that it went real well.“
Banner commented about the
meet as a whole. “Everybody
really helped out right from My-
slinski down to the secretaries.
Everyone pitched in and lent a
hand.“ As things turned out the
pass effort produced a meet that

shows a promising future.

The tennis team was crushed last week 8-1 and 9-0 by tough
Akron and Kent State squads but all was not lost.

“I believe the team gained a lot of experience by playing
against better tennis players." Pitt Coach Fran Webster explained.
"There is a special way to play against better players and the team
is seeing this. “ ,

Webster cited the game Bill Wood played in number three
singles against Akron as an example. Wood won the first set in
what the coach termed as a “real fine way." “He hit well and
had no errors." Webster pointed out. “Then his opponent changed

Les Abromovitz battled through

“However it was just not his

In number six singles Tom Mc-
Knight described his 6-0. 6-4

first set with my serve. Then in

the second set my serve

the net they have problems.”

In tennis action last Wednes-
day Pitt dropped the meet to the
tough 5-5 Kent State squad.
Webster summed upthe meet
by saying “We didn‘t play well
at all. It started to rain during
the first set and we didn't think
we'd even finsih but we did. The
singles didn't show well and al-
though the doubles were close
we still lost." 6

Webster. however. doesn’t see
the future tennis competition
this week as a grim picture. “We
are playing teams of less strength
than we did in the beginning of
the season. So we're hoping for
some wins.“ Tomorrow the
squad travels to Grove City hop-
ing to boost their 2-9 record.

Saturday's match against
