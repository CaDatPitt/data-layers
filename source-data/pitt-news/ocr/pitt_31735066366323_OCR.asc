The station had accumulated a total de-

the beginning of the trimester. The admin-

ment of $2,000 but after the $1,800 and sev-
eral other bills were paid the station had
only $50 left. According to Ingram, this was
not enough to even allow the station to

operate a month. '

Beyond its operating expenses, the sta-
tion had hoped to buy certain pieces of
equipment with which to better service
the University community. Among the
equipment WPGH had hoped to buy was an

Nearly $1200 Working Capital

The WPGH desk blotter sales have raised
the campus radio station’s operating capital
from 50 cents to $1285. The increase is
due to the work of Dick Ingram, WPGH
business manager on the blotter and the
support of Oakland merchants in the form

Other units which the station wanted to
purchase were a new transmitter for the
nurses’ quarters, $300; transmitters for the
fraternity houses, a $200 cartridge recorder
for advertising spots, and $60 in transmis-
sion rentals for each away football game.

All of this was entirely out of the station’s
reach, said Ingram. ,
Ingram planned the blotter to raise
funds, said most of the advertising space,
designed the layout, assisted by Steve Le-

and several faculty members. The blotter
is being distributed now, after six weeks

Although the 4,000 blotters printed are
to be distributed free, Ingram has grossed
almost $1,900 and expects to clear $1,200 in
profit‘. The advertisers are- almost entirely
from the Oakland area.

Academic Assembly Selects /New
. Liberal Arts Executive Council

By VICKI EPSTEIN

The Academic Assembly, con-
sisting of the deans, chairman,
and faculty of the School of Lib-
eral Arts, met ‘last week to elect
an executive council.

The executive council consists -

of _two members of the faculty

. elected at large from humanities,

s
pl
.

social science, and natural sci-
‘ence. Since all the members of

the current council have com-

pleted their terms, the individual
from each division who received

- the highest number of votes will I

serve a two year term, and the
other officer will serve one year.

The .faculty members of the
executive, council are: Rodolfo
Cardona, chairman of romance
languages; Charles R. Crow, pro-
fessor of English, serving two
years; Jerome Rosenberg, profes-
sor of chemistry, serving two

years; John R. Townsend, asso-'

ciate professor of physics; Allen

;'\,NPollack, p m f e s s o r of history,

'., (.

serving two years; and Irwin W.
Schulman, “instructor of political

scienve. Dr. Kehl is chairman ex, _

officio, and Norman W. Mulgrave
assistant dean of Liberal Arts, is
a member ex officio without vote.

The executive council acts for

the Academic Assembly during V

periods between meetings, but it
may not act contrary to existing
Assembly policies. It will also re-

all decisions on important mat-
ters, and create and appoint all
ad hoc committees.

A major part of the executive

council’s program for the year-

'will be to study the Liberal Arts
Cabinet evaluation of distribu-
tion courses, made last year. The
Cabinet consists of students-
chosen by SG to evaluate all 80’s
and 180's courses and professors.
, Dr. Kehl feels that the students
have .a right to express their

point of view and to know Why
certain decisions are made. He
encouraged a closer communica-
tion between faculty and stu-
dents. .

Looking at the Liberal‘ Arts
Cabinet report “affords a basis
for a department or professor to
look at what w.as done,” Dr. Kehl
said.

bership on the Libera\lArts Cabi-

a “call to all people in the aca-

strong American foreign policy,
and a call for a halt to commu-
nist aggression.”

It was attended by. over one

thousand Young Republicans,

Young Democrats, Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom, and represent-
atives of campus newspapers and

‘ students, governments from all

over the country.

The agenda consisted of open-
ing remarks from officials of the
Junior Chamber of Commerce,
addresses by Senator Thomas
D'odd (Dem.-Conn.); Tran Van
Chuong, past South Vietnamese
ambassador to the United States;
and Joseph’Luman, former press
attache at the American Embassy
in Saigon. Also, two panel discus-

sions were held; the ﬁrst-_consist--

ing of university professors, and
the other made up of college
students who had spent some
time in Vietnam.

Steve Santangelo, national vice-
president of the Junior Chamber
of Commerce, told the audience
that “our story is not\being told,”
because support of the adminis-
tration’s policy “is just not news."
It is up to the nation’s students to
“show the world what we young
people believe in.”

Santangelo said that “to our
GI’s in! Vietnam what is most
demoralizing is not the hard liv-

Attend Washington Symposium on Vietnamese Crisis

(Continued from Page 1)

Jerome Conkling, national chair-
man of the Speak-Up Jaycees,
said that the “leftist-led” dem-
onstrations give “an appaling
image of the youth of this coun-
try. These acts which border on
sedition fulfill their purpose,”
which is to foster and advance
the international communist con-
spiracy. .

Due to illness, Senator Dodd
was unable to appear before the
group, but his scheduled speech
was delivered by David Martin,
an aid.

Dodd stated that the “peace”
marchers have given an “illusory
impression. Ten men who shout
attract more attention than one
thousand who disagree with what
they are saying but remain si-

_ lent.” Dodd predicted that the

voices of freedom on our cam-
puses will drown out those of
appeasement.”

He then went on to describe
some of the arguments frequent-
ly presented by those who dis-
agree with the United States po-

. licy in Vietnam. “The first ques-

tion usually presented is: Why
are we in Vietnam?” Dodd answer-
ed by saying that “our own securi-
ty demans that a line be drawn
against communist imperialism.
-It is in our national interest to
assist every nation that ﬁghts
communist subversion.” We are
not there, he said, “merely to
help South Vietnam, but all of
Southeast Asia.” ,

Dodd then posed another ques-
tion: “How do know that the
South Vietnamese don't want
communism?" He countered by
saying “there are no Gallup polls,
but I am convinced that the
South Vietnamese people are one

' of the most anti-communist peo-

ple in the world. The South
is composed

mainly of volunteers, and they
have frequently fought to the last
man .against the communists.”

He then continued by citing
the “mass exodus of refugees
from communist regimes which
are unprecedented in the world,
except possibly those from Nazi
Germany. What makes commu-
nism so insufferable is that it
demands the right to dictate
every aspect of everyday life of
the people.

“Communism is committed,”
Dodd maintained, “by its history,
actions, words, and basic philo-
sophy to total world conquest.”
He cited the recent speech of
Communist Chinese Marshal Lin
Piao, “which spelled out in great
detail how the Chinese. commu-
nists plan to surround the capi-
talist countries and take over the
world. The communists have
spelled out their objectives as
clearly as Hitler did in Mein
Kampf. They have given us fair
warning and we will ignore it at
our own risk.

The third issue Dodd raised
w.as that of the Geneva Accords.
It is frequently charged that the
United States encouraged the
South Vietnames to violate the
Accords by refusing to hold elec-
tions in 1956. Dodd said that “in-
sofar as the Geneva Accords per-
tain to the Vietnamese problem,
they called for a military truce
between the French and the Viet
Minh, partition of the country at
the 17th parallel, free exodus of

refugees both ways, and the for-
mation of a three nation control,

commission.” These agreements
were signed by the ntions in-
volved. Appended to these agree-
ments,‘ and signed by no one,
were ambiguous plans for elec-

tions in the entire country. “It

should be clear," Dodd said, “that
such a declaration binds no one.”

Considering that the legal as-
pects of the Geneva Accords
were ﬁrst violated by the North
Vietnamese, “elections would be
a travesty of the letter and spir-
it of the declaration even if it
was binding.”

The last question brought up
by Dodd was the often-heard
complaint that the cost of human
life is not worth the benefits
involved with staying in Vietnam.
He. said that “those who advocate
pulling out have not weighed the
consequences of an American de-
feat. It would be catastrophic. If

A we cannot cope with Vietnam,

the result would be a dozen more
Vietnams. Our defense line would
ultimately be drawn at Seattle
and Alaska. We could not long
survive in a world of total com-
munism. We must ‘draw the line,
but the question is where. It
should be right in Vietnam, for
if this line fails, it will be ex-
tremely difficult to draw another
one.” ~
In an emotional address, for-
mer Ambassador Chuong told the
audience that “the‘ situation

 

 

 

 

would have collapsed in Vietnam
if the United States had not
struck back. American bombing
creates a deﬁnite danger to the
aggressor.

Chuong continued by noting‘
that “some say that one Ameri-
can life is not worth our goals
in Vietnam. The French and Bri-
tish thought so at Munich and
they paid for their error.” He
maintained that “Africa and Asia
are like sailboats—they have no
power of their own, .and they go.
the wind goes.”

SG President   Creates

Eight New Committees

(Continued from Page 1)
creation of effective communica-
tion; deﬁnition of SG’s executive
branchpowers; decision on the
disenfranchisement of graduate
students; and policy regarding
suggestion of ideas and programs
to other major organizations.

The purpose of the Secondary
Schools Committee which Hogan
wants to reestablish this year is
to personally contact outstanding
high school juniors and seniors
to interest them in the Universi-
ty. “Follow-up programs could be
initiated in coopertaion with the
Admissioxis Office to provide an
informal ‘at-home’ orientation to
Pitt, as well as . . . some sort of
‘big brother-big sister’ program,”
Hogan suggested. ‘ ’

The Class Organization Com-
mitte would establish a commit-
tee of undergraduates from the
respective classes to work with
the Alumni Oﬁice after gradua-
tion. The would help publicize,
plan and attend alumni activities
for the members of their grad-
uating class. Senator Jim J.anis
and Mark Senick are co-chair-
men of the committee.

The Integrity Committee sug-
gested by Hogan would have the
role of“‘indoctrination‘ of incom-
ing students with the purpose of
creating an atmosphere of aca-
demic integrity, and an attitude
of protection and preservation of
University property and the prop-
erty of other students.”

The Human Relations Commit-
tee under Senator Gerry Rosen
will investigate conditions and
rates of ' off-campus housing. It
may work with the LD. Card
Committee to extend the use of-
the card to charge-account priv-

ileges --and check-cashing services
at local businesses. 1

plans to check into the proﬁt-

He established a Student Rela-

group will co-operate with “the
SG Director of Publicity to im-
prove students awareness of the
operations of SG and the Senate
Committees and to increase stu-

Senate committees, “working
in areas of great importance to

suggested that the Student Activ-

so.

Hogan named the committee
chairmen at last Thursday"s meet-

 The recent [announcement of the new Executive Council chosen by
he ‘Academic Assembly may provide a starting point for a new concept in

 The ‘faculty group will analyzethe Liberal Arts (LA) Cabinet Eval-
“tion of the Distribution of Studies Courses. While this arrangement pro-
des some of the closer communication necessary between faculty and stu-
ents, it is only a meager start on a long, and often avoided, road.

' Dr. James Kehl, Dean of Liberal Arts, emphasized the need for closer
‘culty-student communication, the rights of students to express their
_',o ts of view, and their rights to know’ why decisions are made.

The Executive Council can serve as a stronger impetus to such com-

as presently exists, would be avoided, and the group could have power to
analyze and recommend needed changes.

Dean of Natural Sciences David Halliday criticized last year’s LA
Cabinet report as being a good start but unprofessional. The merger of
the faculty and student groups would help correct the unscientific approach
and provide more cooperation from students and professors. . .

As the LA Cabinet reports now stand, they haveno power except as
recommendations to the faculty group. The merging of the faculty and
student groups would provide an effective group whose proposals would be
implemented by the School of Liberal Arts. ‘

Such a rennovation in policy-making groups would add to the fastly
growing concept of student involvement in policy-making. Antioch and
Reed colleges have already begun work in this direction, and Chatham
President Edward D. Eddy has emphasized the need for “genuine student
involvement in the formulation of educational policy.”

This University’s ‘academic standards have and will be questioned .
until its ﬁnancial problems are solved. Student-faculty cooperation, not
complete control by either, in Liberal Arts policy-making would not only

Letters To The Editor

field, but lost interest because
there was not enough informa-
tion available. V

Surely, many undergrads study ,

their class assignments in a li-
brary, but there are many too
who use’ the special reference
sources. in a graduate library to
advantage when these sources
are made accessible. The possi-

bility of self-education through

reading of stimulating, more ad-
vanced literature is being ruled
out.

Another administrative assump-
tion is that if undergraduates
are allowed to use graduate li-
braries, then graduate students
will be crowded out. To those

vwho used the Scaife library and

saw the many empty seats and
desks, this protestation is laugh-
able. ‘ ‘

What is suggested here is that
that Student Government repre-
sentatives, instead of worrying
about whether Tweedle-dum or
Tweedle-dee will lead them in
unimportant, innocuous cam-
paigns, should rather concern
themselves with real problems,
such as the‘”library infringement.
It is hoped that the Student Gov-

   
 
   

  

   
   
 

viously fail to perceive. The truth,
according to Mr. Disler, is that

V American intervention in the Do-

minican Republic “was an at-
temp to prevent the advocates of
bloody world revolution from
aggrandizing their miniscule pow-
er in this hemisphere” whereas

Russian intervention in Hungary ’

was obviously a “blatant suppres-
sion of freedom.”

This passage typiﬁes the smug
attitude of those who pride them-
selves in their inferior intellect.
For the truth (with a small “t”)
is that any country can ration-
alize any behavior (e.g., “in de-
fense of freedom”) any time it
wants to. _

Thus Americans feel that it is
right for Americans to-have for-
eign military bases with missiles
aimed at Russia, but it is wrong
for Russians to have missiles in
Cuba aimed at the United States.
How secure Mr. Disler and “those
'*‘»re him must feel in believing
in our righthess and their wrong-
ness. Yet how deadly such a be-
lief can be.

I have no answers; Mr. Disler
does. But I feel that it is the ques-
tions raised by men like Com-

 

includes anyone left of Joseph
Welch) does not deserve a hear-
ing, and that all good people
should cover their ears lest dan-
gerous ideas enter.

Perhaps after .all The Pitt News
should stick to whimpering about
campus inanities, and dream of
the Great University, where there
shall be ﬂoats at Homecoming,
bigger and better athletes, and
Mickey-Mouse “Student Govern-
ment” for ever.

Editor, The Pitt News:
In regard to the editorial of
"Oct. 18, concerning the Student

- Government (SG) meeting of Oct.

14, let me say that the whole
story has not been told. SG has
had a rough time of it so far
this trimester, but it would ap-
pear to me that the’ senate is
really trying to make order out
of disorder. The very real pow-

er of The Pitt News in forming .

student opinion seems to be bent

not be used. Therefore, the SG
budget is used to meet ﬁnancial
obligations. Homecoming is run
on a balanced budget, and that
budget is determined by-project-
ed estimates of ticket sales.

So, this year with ‘estimated
sales at between 500 and 600
people,’ the Homecoming Com‘-
mittee can only put out what it
expects to take in. The commit-
tee knew how much they could
spend and planned accordingly.

This year’s Homecoming can,
and, will be a very enjoyable
weekend for all those who at-
tend. Instead of _harping on a
few of SG’s shortcomings, why
can’t something be said about SG

President Jerry Hogan’s .presi-'

dential program to activate the
Secondary School Committee, the
Class Organization Committee, or
the Liberal Arts Cabinet?

I can only hope that in the fu-
ture The Pitt News will be an aid
to SG in bringing to the student
body all of the. facts -about SG
actvities. ‘

,, Y.CorpBegins Recreational Project
For Low Income Neighborhoods

\

By BERN! McLEOD

A child’s need for social and
recreational activity is often neg-
lected because of poor environ-
mental conditions .and the lack
of organized neighborhood pro-
grams. To combat this situation,
University students through the
organization of the Y-Corps, are
working with Pittsburgh children
in neighborhood Y's, churches
and playgrounds.

In low—income areas such as
Homewood-Brushton and South
Oakland, interested students have
organized neighborhood programs
which, unlike HEP, are not ac-
tually tutorial. Instead, accord-
ing to Claudia Bentz (L.A., ’67),
a group leader, “the objective is
to give the children the oppor-
tunity of being part of a small,
personal semi-organized group,
and give them new experiences
by way of activities and ﬁeld
trips.”

Miss Bentz and Peggi Herold
(Ed., ’66) began work last July
with a group of eight to ten\ year
old girls from the Homewood-
Brushton area. As, leaders, the
women planned activities design-

‘ ed to help the children with their

school work. .

The group of girls was gather-
ed by a canvas carried on with-
in one block of the Homewood-
Brushton “Y,” under the guid-
ance of a_ University student in
the Graduate School of Social
Work. The group leaders are at-
tempting to give. to these chil-_
dren the individual attention that
cannot be provided in the over-
crowded schools. _

“The kids also lacked a situa-
tion where they could meet in-
formally with an adult,” stated
Miss Bentz, “and where there
was no pressure to compete. So
many of these kids have devel-
oped a sense of failure because
they have never been _encour-
aged.” .

In developing the group cirri-
culum, the two girls visited the
neighborhood schools in order to
discuss their program with the
teachers. “We were told," Miss
Herold said, “that the most im-
portant thing we could do was to
encourage " them to talk.

“I didn’t expect what I found,”
she continued, “although some of

' the children have never been to

downtown Pittsburgh, live in
poor physical conditions, and
have never belonged, to a ‘Y,’
they are very interested in the
club and come, each week. The

kids really seem to love music,
and we work on that, since even
if their families have small bud-
gets, they usually buy a TV and
stereo.”

The ﬁnal goal of this project is
to have the high school students
become group leaders, thus mak-
ing it a neighborhood program.
This is quite possible because of
the interest of‘ area people, es-
pecially the parents. ‘

 Bazylak Adjusts to Defense Despite

their own play, which, I guess, is

 Desire for Quarterbacking Chores

  

,

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

For Bob Bazylak, a high
school All-American quarter_
back two years ago, the tran-
sition to defense has been
tough going. Due to the Pan-
ther two platoon system,
Bazylak was converted into a
part-time defensive halfback and
safety.

“I can’t really understand the
move,” he said. “I never played
any type of defensive ball before.
I was always an offensive ball-
player. On the ﬁrst day of fall
practice this year, I had a great
day at quarterback. Then the
next morning I found out that I
was switched to defense.”

To say the least, Bazylak has

,not distinguished himself as a
defensive halfback. He was borne
defensive halfback. He has borne
some of the general criticism that
has been leveled on the defense

f 3---~ backﬁeld. Most of his mistakes

must, however, be attributed to
inexperience and lack of conﬁ-
dence.

“In the Duke game,” Bazylak
said, “I was told that if I made
one mistake I wduld be yanked

. out." Well, Bazylak made a mis-

take covering the tricky down
and out pass patterns that Duke.
used and he was immediately re-
placed. ‘

Most people agree that it's
difficult for a sophomore to build
up his conﬁdence on defense
when he is being switched in and
out of the lineup. “Since I never

BOB B
Misplaced Sophomore Back

 

played defense,” Bazylak repeat-

ed, “I don’t expect to be a per-
fect. But if I played a lot, I'd
know more about my position
than I do now.”

Bazylak hasn’t received much
help from experienced defensive
halfbacks Dale Stewart and Tip-
py Pohl. “They're concerned with

how it should be,” he noted.

When the Panthers faced Ore-
gon earlier in the season, Bazy-
lak needed all the help he could
get. He entered the game, his ﬁrst
ever on defense, and lined up
against the Duck’s great end Ray
Palm. “Sure I was scared,”' said
Bazylak. “But I got lucky because
Palm was loaﬁng it out there.
He hardly ran a decent pattern
during the second half.”

Bazylak didn’t have that same
luck later on in the game. Ore-
gon quarterback Tom Travato
threw a pass into the end zone
that Bazylak just missed inter-
cepting. Since Oregon scored the
deciding touchdown a few plays
later, the missed pass received
some attention.

“I got hit from behind just as
I reached for the ball,” Bazylak
said. “I never really had a good
chance for it.” I

Committed to defense for the
remainer of the season, Bazylak
hopes to gain offensive experi-
ence by playing on the defensive
unit. “The coaches tell me,” he
said, “that by knowing instinc-
tively how the defensive half-
back reacts to various pa-ss plays,
I’ll be able to be a better quar-
terback.

“Apparently,” Bazylak contin-
ued, “this means that I'll get an-
other chance at quarterback in
the spring.” He would like noth-
ing better than to have a crack
at offense after what is already a
frustrating season on defense.

Booters Begin With Ohio U., WVU

Injuries Hamper Soccer Tearn’s

Chances In Last Half OfSeason

After ﬁve games the soccer
team owns a 3-1-1 record, but this
Saturday, the Booters start the
long journey, playing stronger
teams than they have played to
date. Injuries, incurred during
the year will halt this journey
before it starts.

‘ Since the season began, injuries
have drained the soccermen of
talent and top-notch playing. Be-
fore the season opener, Aldo Zor-
tea wrenched .a knee. This slow-
,ed him downx during the games
he played because he favored the
bad leg and couldn't play a good
game. Then Al Trauhstsiner end-
ed his playing days when he in-
jured a knee which locked on
him. '

Now it's Dave Shaffer with a
pulled muscle. He can’t do much
running this week. Vince Batta-
_lotta strained a ligament in his
leg. “The trainer gave Bartalotta.
some. treatment, told him to take
it easy and not to do any hard
kicking this week,” said coach

k‘k‘k**k**k**k*k*k‘k****k*t

Leo Bemis.

Besides these two players, Jim
Snyder has been bothered by a
pulled hamstring muscle since
the beginning of the season.
George Sommer is getting over
two leg injuries which contri-
buted to his unusually non-hust-
ling game against Slippery Rock.

After last Saturday's game,
Sommer actually apologized to
his teammates. “I was really tired
in that one. I didn’t cover my
territory at all,” he said.

“Sommer will bounce right back
this week,” said Bemis. “Any-
body can have a bad day and
fall down.” ‘

This Saturday marks the start
of the second-half of the season
when the booters visit Ohio Uni-
versity. “The " tough ones are
coming up in the last half of the
schedule,” Bemis said.

“In order to win at Ohio, we
will have to play our best pos-
sible game,” continued Bemis.
“Except for Bucknell, the other

teams, West Virginia, Akron, and
Penn State are tough opponents.

If we can duplicate our record »

for the ﬁrst half of the season,
we’ll have a decent year.”
Bemis knows that winning in
the latter part of the schedule
depends mainly on scoring goals.
“Although we’ll play almost
the same type of game we have
been using, this week in scrim-
mages we're going to work more
with ‘switches.’

back Lem Fiori on a hand off around end. Pi Lam won, 30-0.

ZBT, Pi Lam Win Openers

The Inter-Fraternity “A”
and “B” leagues opened their
football season Monday a.f—
ternoon at Schenley Oval,
with Zeta Beta Tau and Pi
Lambda Phi both turning in

shutout victories. Pi Lamb wal-
loped Sigma Alpha Mu, 30-0, in
“A” league competition, and ZBT
beat Signa Alpha Epsilon, 12-0,
in the “B” league.

ZBT was thwarted through-
out much of the ﬁrst half by a
tough SAE defense that contin-
ually pressured quarterback Dave
Friedman into throwing bad pass-
es. In the second half, however,
center Steve Merkin came in at
QB, and defenseman Joel Schles-
inger moved over to center. With
more time to throw, Merkin ﬁred"
two third quarter touchdowns to
flanker Thomas Geiger.

SAE, though shutout, revealed

I In Fraternity Football League

a short passing game that put
them into scoring position sev-
eral times. However, most of
their time was spent_ in their
own territory due largely to the
efforts of ZBT punter Lee Pollen.

Pi Lam‘ sparked by two long
touchdown runs and a 'ball-hawk-
ing defense, easily defeated SAM,
30-0. Chuck Green returned the
opening kickoff 70 yards for a
touchdown and four minutes later
Lenny Fiore raced 65 yards with
a punt for another score. Rich-
ard Baumgart, the Pi Lam quar-
terback threw two scoring pass-
es to end Gregg Simmons and
ran for another tally to complete
the scoring. The SAM offense
held in check most of the day,
was limited to one first down
during the whole game. The Pi
Lamb defense intercepted ﬁve
passes. Safety Barry Mishkin in-
tercepted three of those.

as

Slippery Rock to
Oppose Frosh In
Soccer Rematch

The freshman soccer team
meets the Slippery Rock
frosh hooters for the second
time this season this after-
noon at Kennard Field. The

-first time the quads met, Oc-
tober 9, they battled to a 1-1 tie
in an extra period. 0

Coach Bob McNulty pointed out
that Slippery Rock plays a “gang-
tackling defense” in which two
or three men collapse on the
player dribbling the ball. He
added that the consequent strate-
gy for Pitt “To pass them to death.
When they overload a zone, We’ll
just swing the play from ‘one
side of the ﬁeld to the other. The
game will be won at midﬁeld. It
all depends on how our halfbacks
feed the others.” In practice, the
team indicated to the coach that
they were especially eager for to-
morrow’s game.

The frosh overwhelmed Fair-
mont State College, 5-0, in their
only game since the ﬁrst meeting
with Slippery Rock. McNu1ty said
that while he was not happy
with the first-half play in the
October 15 encounter, he was
“very well satisﬁed with the sec-
ond half. We were too relaxed
in the ﬁrst half and got compla-
cent. They had us scrambling.”

The only ﬁrst—half goal was
scored on a headed ball by Erl

' Purnell following .a corner kick

by J eff Rosenglick. Rosenglick
added the second goal himself in
the third quarter with a ﬁve-yard
placement. Fourth period goals
were scored by Brad Johnson on
a 22 yarder “that had eyes,” by
Rosenglick-on a direct kick, and
by Dave Shimpeno, whose 10-
yarder carried the goalie into the
goal. McNulty/' was especially
pleased with the team’s versatil-
ity as he switched lineman around
to different positions w it h o u t
losing any efficiency.

Of Obscurity With Defensive Unit

By TOM SACKS

The sixteen freshmen foot-
ball players who came to Pitt
after having monopolized the
football and most of the at-
tention on some of the best
high school teams in the
country must now be wondering

. if they made the right choice.

Being a freshman gridder at
most colleges is no claim to fame,

but they are at least given a _

chance to unlimber their muscles
in several games and feel like
they’re part of a team. The size
of the Cubs makes it impossible
for them to ﬁeld two squads.
The result has been the can-
celling of the traditional games
with Navy,‘ Penn State and West
Virginia. The games themselves

aren’t of that much importance
to the coaches, but they mean a
lot to the frosh.

Twenty-ﬁve football scholar-
Ships were available for this
year. Nine went begging because
of poor recruiting, Pitt"s ﬁnancial
troubles, -and a 3-5-2 record last
Year. “We’re caught in between
the Ivy schools and schools like
Penn State, who can take any-
body.” said coach John Michelo-
sen.

“The Ivies _will lower their
standards to take those boys
whose grades could get them into
Pitt, but we can’t lower ours to
take boys that go to State or
Syracuse.”

These are the reasons for 16 S
freshmen. However, Kent State,
which doesn’t even play big time

The most effective way to evaluate a com-
pany in terms of its potential for dynamic
career growth is to examine its past rec-
ord, its current status, and its prospects
and planning for the future, together with
the professional climate it offers for the
development of your individual capabilities.
Boeing, which in 1966 completes 50 years
of unmatched aircraft innovation and pro-
duction, offers you career opportunities as
diverse as its extensive and varied back- ,
log. Whether your interests lie in the field
of commercial jet airliners of the future or
in space-flight technology, you can find at
Boeing an opening which combines profes-.
sional challenge and long-range stability.
The men of Boeing are .today pioneering ‘
evolutionary advances in both civilian and
military aircraft, as well as in space pro-
grams of such historic importance as
America’s first moon landing. Missiles,
space vehicles, gas turbine engines, trans-
port helicopters, marine vehicles and basic
, research are other areas of Boeing activity.

There's a spot where your talents can
mature and grow at Boeing, in research,
"design, test, manufacturing or administra-
tion. The company’_s position’ as world
leader in jet transportation provides a
measure of the calibre of people with
whom you would work. In addition, Boeing
people work in small groups, where initia-
tive and ability get maximum exposure. ‘
Boeing encourages participation in the
company-paid Graduate Study Program at
leading colleges and universities near
company installations.
We're looking forward to meeting engi-
neering, mathematics and science seniors
and graduate students during our visit to
your campus. Make an appointment now
at your placement office. Boeing is an
equal opportunity employer.
