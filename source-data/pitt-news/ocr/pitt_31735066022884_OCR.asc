By THOMAS HEE'I'ER

pm News sum Writer

Thomas Hajduk was sworn in
May 28 as a Commonwealth
Trustee of the University of Pitts-
burgh in ceremonies at the
Cathedral of Learning. He was ap-
pointed and commissioned by the
governor, Richard Thornburgh.

This marks only the third time in
the University of Pittsburgh's
history that a student has been ap-
pointed to their board of trustees.
Hajduk is currently completing
undergraduate studies in com-
munications at the University of
Pittsburgh’s College of General
Studies, so he will be in a position

to bring the student’s views to the
University’s Board of Trustees,
Hajduk said. But, according to
Hajduk, he is not solely the
student’s advocate. His first priori-
ty is to support and represent the
Commonwealth's system of higher
education.

Hajduk was recently elected

President of the College of General
Studies Student Cabinet, after hav-
ing served a term of office as a
cabinet member. He _has also served
;on a number of other student com-
mittees, including the University
Senate Committee.

Hajduk, a jeweler, is also a
member of the Council for the Col-

orn in as Trustee; Third Time in Pitt History

official delegate to the United
States Association of Evening

Students for the University of Pitts-

visiting one of the many ports the
S.S. Universe will stop at during its
voyage.

“There will be lots of scholarship
money available to students,” but
he cautioned that students must
prepare for this experience in ad-
vance.

“It would be better to start plan-
ning for the Semester at Sea pro-
gram during your second year, so
that by your senior year you are
prepared ﬁnancialy to embark upon
this academic sojourn,” said
Miller.

The Semester at Sea program is
reported to cost each student ap-
proximately $6,500.

“It’s a home away from home,”
Miller said, referring to his ex-
perience aboard the S.S. Universe.
1 Since 1977, Miller has been in-
volved in medicine, as a part-time
faculty member of Dartmouth
Medical College.

Miller became interested in
medicine while living in East Africa,
‘‘I became interested in people’s
medicine and herbal remedies while
conducting rural studies in East
Africa.”

His interest continued after he
was invited to join Dartmouth’s
medical staff in 1977. At Dart-
mouth, Miller began studying the

“barefoot doctor” model in China.

Miller became a member of a

U.S. Health Studies group that
visited China in September of 1979.
His observations while in China
were based on the practice of
Chinese Traditional medicine (the
barefoot doctor method) and
China’s approach to Western
medicine. Miller's findings can be
read in AUFS’s - “REPORTS,”
entitled,_

medicine, health education and ac-

cess to health care, according to
Miller.

Miller explained the fervor cur-
rently going on in China, as China
prepares to embrace the new .
technology from the West.

He considers this “climate of
change” refreshing “to any con-
temporary visitor to China.”

He discussed China’s “Four
Principles of Health,” in China’s
efforts to attain modernization;
prevention, serve the workers,
peasants and soldiers (particularly
to emphasize medical service),
medical work as part of the Mass
Campaign and to combine Tradi-
tional and Western medicine.

Miller said China has even started U
a national anti-spitting campaign as
a part of their “prevention” in-
order tostop disease.

Referring to China’s Traditional
medicine based on ancient Chinese

practices, Miller said, “traditional
Chinese medicine has been
standardized for teaching in
China’s medical colleges.” He said

the four components of traditional\
medicine are theory, “which deals’ '

with the ideas of health harmony
and balance,” diagnosis and
prescriptions, herbal medicine and

Miller praised China’s over-
whelming acceptance of the West
and the ‘beginnings of a new rela-
tionship. Miller also pointed out
that many U.S. businesses and
universities are now focusing on
trade with China, including Pitt.

“Pitt has some new interests in
China, Chancellor Posvar has been
instrumental in opening connec-
tions there; he should be supported
in this area,” Miller said.

“Pitt is one of the best in the
country in international studies,”
Miller said, adding that he can see
exchange programs opening with

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa‘-.
To the 15,801 Cuban refugees arriv-
ing at this processing center, Fidel
Castro’s Cuba consists of memories
of contradictions between the
political slogans and the grim
realities.

For the thousands of Cubans ar-
riving on the boat ﬂotilla at Key
West, Florida since April 18, the
story began on a warm and
cloudless New Year’s morning,
1959, when Fidel Castro and his
mountain guerrillas sent the dic-'

Happening only ninety miles
from American shores in a land
blessed with the fertility of produc-
ing 6,000,000 tons of sugar annual-
ly, it was called “La Revolucion”,
and it ended the empire of a

tyranical egotist who had‘ stunned’

the hopes of a disillusioned nation.

Emerging from the mountains of
the Sierra Maestra, Castro was
revered and admired, an idealist
who revolted in the name of the
people who had suffered under

Batista. Using the one-sided power
of revolutionary justice, seventy-
one members of Batista’s army
were executed as “war criminals”
after publicly attended court mar-
tials.

Castro eventually became
premier after his dramatic victory,
and he directed his energies upon a
twenty-point program of reform for
Cuba. There was to be agrarian
reform, protective tariffs, in-
dustrialization to furnish hundreds
of thousands of jobs, low—cost
housing programs, salary increases
with reductions of salaries .for
ministers, reduction of rents and
public service fees, a new area for
the capital, creation of a merchant
marine, increased efforts for the na-
tional motion picture industry, new
positions within the government, a
campaign to increase the consump-
tion of national products, a reduc-
tion of traffic accidents, a cam-

. paign to buy bonds of the Savings

and Housing Institute, and the
hope of locating a_ World Fair in
Cuba.

Even before he overthrew the
Batista dictatorship, foes of Castro
were charging that the revolution
was a communist one. The charges
were emphatically denied by Castro
and his supporters, but were rein-
forced "by the Castro regime’s own
actions: mass executions, ex-
propriations, refusal to hold elec-
tions, closer identification with the
Communist nations, and anti-“im-
perialist” propaganda on an inter-
national scale. -

In a 1961 May Day speech,
Castro announced that he had made
Cuba a Socialist country. And then
on December 2 of that year Castro
asserted that he was a “Marxist-
Leninist”and was leading Cuba to

communism. . ' I

During the 21 year time-span

since the revolution, nearly one
million Cubans have fled, as
persecuted exiles and anticom-
munists who disagreed with the
“Castroism” form of Cuban
government.

And now», the evidence of a
changing situation in Cuba appears
more vivid every day, as the United
States receives the waves of

emigrants who Castro has permit-

ted to leave.

But these emigrants are different
from the past, free to talk about
communism, Castro, and Cuba,
and they paint a dark picture of the
land they fled..

Although many who witnessed
the effects of the Castro revolution
will admit that Cuba has made ad-
vances in a number of areas, such as

education, medicine, and sports,
many of the refugees at this military
reserve training base talked about

.the scarcity of consumer goods,

government corruption, and
mistreatment by the police.

“The money in Cuba isn’t impor-
tant,” said a Cuban man, “because
if you have money you don’t pay
for anything. You have few things

for the people, no clothes, no televi- . .

sions, no radio...the‘ money isn’t
very important in Cuba.
“If you have a hundred dollars, it

’ is the same as if you have a dollar,

because when you have a hundred
dollars you can’t pay for anything.
In Cuba, there are few things to pay
for. ” _ .

“American cigarettes cost five
dollars a pack in Cuba, but not.in
the stores, they don’t have cigaret-
tes, only outside of the store. Peo-
pie. in the street sell them-the black
market,” said a woman who had
worked in a food store in Cuba.

_in Cuba, fled the country from
Havana after her husband had been

in jail as a political prisoner for
more than three years.

“He’s in jail, and the police said
he can’t speak with anybody. He
can’t ‘speak with his sister, his
brother, his mother, me, nobody,
because he's in jail,?’ she said.

Most of the Cubans admit to hav-
ing been searched by the Cuban

police as they left the country,-
where their money and valuables.

were confiscated. Consequently,
the Cubans are still wearing the
clothing they travelled in and some
small children were clothed only in
their underwear.

_ “We had our families and our
houses in Cuba, but now we don’t
have anything. Liberty is the only
thing we have now,” one woman
said. “Now we are free, but we
don’t have anything.”‘

And now the tired, dazed aliens
are penniless and jobless, experienc-
ing a total upheaval of their world--
an unknown venture that, unsettl-
ing or ‘terrifying as it may be, is bet-
ter than the life that lies behind.

Revised Media Con

By CLARE GLEASON

Pitt News Staff Writer

The proposed revisions to The
Media and Publications Board
Constitution are expected to be ap-
proved by the vice chancellor for
student affairs within a month, ac-
cording to Andy Smith, director of

' student activities.

The controversial revisions would

n delegate the authority of editorial

appointments to The Media and
Publications Board instead of the
respective media staffs as the
previous constitution allowed.
“The Board will consist of four
professionals from within or

- without the university community

appointed by the vice chancellor for
student affairs; the student media
advisor, employed by the Office of
Student Activities; two students
named by the Student Government

-Board (SGB); and two students

named by the executive officers of
The Pitt News, Backspace, The
Owl, and WPGH,” according «to
the constitution.

SGB and the executive officers of
the respective student mediums
“Shall establish a process by which
their representatives are chosen,”
according to the revisions.

The director of student activities
has been delegated primary authori-
ty by the vice chancellor for student
affairs over student publications
and media, and is directly responsi-
ble for supervision of their aac-

’ tivities.

The media advisor will be ap-
pointed and can be removed by the
director of student activities. He
will serve as treasurer of the board,
and a full voting member.

The Preamble has been restated,
deleting the original intention “to
provide autonomous Student
Publications and Media.” replacing
it with the intended proposal “to
design supervisory mechanisms that
do not conflict with the right to free
speech.”

The Board will be responsible for
approving capital expenditures,

reviewing financial

budgets, and advertising rates, and
it will serve as publisher of recogniz-
ed student publications and media.

The Statements of Purpose, Con-
stitutions, Bylaws and editorial
policies of the respective media and
publications will be subject to the
approval of the Board.

' Both Conney Kimbo and Andy
Smith were unavailable for com-
merit.

However, contact was made with
board of trustees member, A.E.
Lawson, the Student Affairs Com-
mittee Chairman, who addressed
the past board meeting of May 14,
1980, on the subject of the May 7,
1980 revisions to the constitution.

At the meeting Lawson said, “It
has provided a braoder profes-
sionalism to the media. The system
set up seems quite an advancement
over the previous system.

“It avoids a self-perpetuating
government,” Lawson had said.

According to Lawson, the SGB is
in favor of the revisions, but The
Pitt News is the only publication
dissatisfied with them.

“No one wants to muzzle the Pitt
News, least of all the board of
trustees,”said Lawson.

But the media groups disagreed
with Lawson.

“I think we were misrepresented
at the board of trustees meeting,”
said Karen Metzinger, editor of
Backspace Magazine, adding, “90
percent of the compromise has been
on the part of the media, ten per-
cent on the part of student affairs.
Our wishes have fallen on deaf
ears."

“Our requests and suggestions
were basically ignored,” according’
to Dave Kovach, general manager
of WPGH radio station. “Items
were left in that we requested to be
deleted. The process for selection of
the chief officers of the .media
groups is" totally different than
anything we discussed with the Of-
ﬁce of Student Activities. The pro-
posed selection committee process

SGB member Martin Bertocchi
said he was concerned about the
lack of student control in the pro-
posed constitutions.
“There are too many advisers

and toomuch control by the Office
of Student Affairs,” Bertocchi
said. “I don’t like the revisions any
better than the original. If
anything, it’s a step backward,” he
added.

According to Bertocchi, the SGB

After a two week layoff, the
Pitt tracksters swing back into
action as they journey to the
Buckeye State of Ohio to enter
the Central Collegiate Cham-
pionships this weekend. The .
meet will be hosted by Bowling
Green University.

Several Panthers are coming
off sparkling performances as

V they prepare for their biggest
meet of the year.

At Rutgers University, Dar-
ren Geary burned the track in
1:49.9 in the half mile event,
while teammate Greg Conover
achieved his lifetime best with
a time of 1252.5 , finishing right

Pitt Tracksters Ready for Action

behind Geary.

Meanwhile, at the Penn
State Open, Gary Siriano rose
to new heights in the
1500-meter run with a time of
3:49.4, a new personal high.

. The mile relay team of Darryl
Baynes, Dwayne DeFoor, Bud
Cooper and Al Coles were also
impressive as they dashed to
their fastest time this year, a
dazzling 3:13.7. ’

At Bowling Green, Panthers
entering the competition in-
clude Larry Kinney in the triple
jump, Ralph Mitton in the long
jump and triple jump, Randy
Bailey in the steeplechase, Bud
Cooper in the 400-yard dash,
and Darryl Baynes and‘ Al

Coles in the 100-yard dash.
Also competing for Pitt will be
Bob Thompson in the long
jump, Gary Siriano in the
5000-meter run, the 440 relay
team of Baynes, DeFoor,
Cooper and Coles, and Darren
Geary, Joel Albers, Greg Con-
over and Terry Gallagher in the
half mile.

Gallagher is recovering from
a slight hamstring strain but
Panther head coach Mike
Agostinella indicated he should
be at full strength by the
weekend. He added that the
squad is “looking forward to
the meet optimistically. ” In the
midst of their current hot
streak, it’s easy to see why.

Senate Bill 1722 Ready For Vote
Sometime in June or July

By CONNIE McCLAlN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Senator Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) and Senator Strom Thur-
mond (R-S.C.) are sponsoring it.
The National Committee Against
Repressive Legislation (NCARL) is
opposing it. Senate Bill 1722 will be
voted on in June or early July. June
10, 1980, is the tentative date set for
the vote.

S. 1722, composed of over 600
pages, was introduced on
September 7, 1979, by Senator Ken-
nedy and Senator Thurmond. It is
also sponsored by Senators DeCon-
cini, (D-Ariz.) Hatch (R-Utah) and
Simpson (R-Wyoniing).

There is much controversy con-
cerning this bill. NCARL represen-
tatives say it is a version of S.l.

The Brown Commission was
cieated on July 4, 1966, to improve
zriminul ' justice laws. Attorney
GCl'I’~;':v.l John Mitchell was told to
rev» rite the criminal laws on

A J.1nI!ury I, 1971. In March, 1973,

Mitchell's bid went to Congress.

The Senate Judiciary Subcom-
mittee‘ voted against S.1 on
December 3., 1975. May 2, 1977,
Senators Kennedy and McClellan
introduced S. 1437. S. 1437 was ap-
proved by the Senate Judiciary
Committee on November 2, 1977.
January 30, 1978, S. 1437 was ap-
proved by the Senate.

S. 1437 was rejected on August
17, 1978, by the House Judiciary
Subcommittee. September 7, 1979,
S. I722 was introduced. S. 1722
was approved by the Senate Judi-

local news media which included
four television stations, The
Washington Star and various radio
stations.

In discussing the success of the
DCMI '80 campaign, Farnham said
he was generally optimistic and at-
tributed this to demographic
changes in the District. Farnham
estimated that 60 to 80 percent of
those residents now living in the
D.C. area were young professionals
with more liberal attitudes.

Pa. coordinator for NORML,
Bob Pisani, reported that there is
no initiative currently underway to
make marijuana _decriminalization
an issue on the November, 1980,
ballot in this state. Pisani said the

reason was that the Pa. Constitu-

ciary Committee on December 4,
1979. An omnibus bill,» House of
Representatives bill 6915 is now in
the House Judiciary Committee for
markup.

H.R. 6915 is “not quite as bad”
for civil liberties, but H.R. 6915 and
amendments areequal to or worse
than S. 1722,” according to an
NCARL spokesperson.

NCARL doesn’t approve of
either bills, according to the
NCARL -spokesperson. In addi-
tion, NCARL believes that various
sections within the bills are op-
pressive. The spokesperson said
NCARL doesn’t approve of the
omnibus approach but believes the
criminal code “should have more of
a piecemeal approach.” .

NCARL is opposed‘ to four
specific items in S.. 1122: ’ “In-
creasing federal jurisdiction, this in-
cludes demonstrating at nuclear and
energy facilities. The preventive
detention section, broad disgression
of the judge to deny bail to of-
fenders. The government is given
the right to appeal sentences and
parole is abolished, this forces of-
fenders to serve full sentences,” the
spokesperson said.

NCARL believes some parts of S.
1722 are good; for instance, the
rape and the child custody section.
It provides that a woman can pro-
secute her husband if he rapes her
and a spouse cannot take achild he
doesn’t have custody of out of the
state and receive custody.

Senator Kennedy’s reasons "for

~ support of the bill are that “S. 1722

initiative Seeks Ballot

tion does not allow for a referen-
dum on social questions.

The most recent proposal by Pa.
NORML, according to Pisani, died
in the House Judiciary Committee
in October, 1979, and there is no
legislation currently pending.

Pisani stated that 60- to 70,000
Pennsylvania residents have been
arrested on marijuana charges in
the past seven years, ‘and, as a
result, have acquired permanent
criminal records. These records are
. fairly accessible to different organi-
zations, and affect credit ratings
and housing, as well as job applica-
tions of the parties concerned.

Current Pa. statutes prohibit
“the manufacture, sale or delivery,
holding, offering for sale, or
possession of any controlled

constitutes a substantial gain” and
“the bill although not pure, is a vast
improvement,” according to Ken-
nedy’s aide. The aide said the
senator is’ against using the
piecemeal approach to the bill
because “passing one law at a time
would take years.”

Senator Thurmond supports the
bill because “reform of federal
criminal law is far overdue” and
“like any major body of law, the
time has come,” according to an
aid to the Senator. Thurmond’s
aide said the senator thinks the bill
is an “effort to drop "outmoded and
unused statutes” and will make the
federal prosecution system more ef-
ficient.

Senator Thurmond supports
“90-95 percent of S. 1722,” accor-
ding to the aide. The senator’s aide
said Thurmond thinks the lessening
of sentences is wrong, the easing of
the obscenities law is wrong, and he
is against legalizing the use of one-
third of an ounce or less of mari-
juana.

Like Sen. Kennedy, Senator
Thurmond is against using a piece-
meal. approach to the bill. He
believes if it is handled that way, it
would be “repeating errors of the
past.” '

“That’s traditionally been the
way law hasdeveloped. What has
happened is we have some 70 dif-
ferent statutes dealing with theft.
This bill has one,” the Senator’s
aide said. ’

substance. . . ” The law, more
specifically, prohibits’ the posses-
sion of small amounts of marijuana
for personal use; the possession of
small amounts of marijuana with
intent to distribute, but not to sell;
and the distribution of a small
amount of marijuana, but not for
sale. The statute defines “small
amount” as 30 grams of marijuana.

According to the Pa. statute, any
person who violates this law is guil-
ty of a misdemeanor and upon con-
viction (depending on the amount
of marijuana), could be sentenced
to imprisonment not exceeding 30
days, or to pay a. fine notexceeding
$500, or both. If amounts of mari-
juana are in excess of 30 grams, im-
prisonment can be up to one year,

or a fine not to exceed $5000 or

both.
