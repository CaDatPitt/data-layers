. Hulda Tully and Leo Harter
Receive Theatron ‘Oscars’

For their portrayals of an un-
happy Dutch ghost and the Italian
father of an ambitious prize—ﬁghter,
Huida Tully, C41, and Leo Harter,
C42, received one of the highest
dramatic honors at the University,
rniniature “Oscars,” at the Pitt
Players’ banquet Tuesday evening.

The annual award is given by
Theatron, honorary dramatic so-
ciety, to honor the man and woman
who have contributed the ﬁnest per-
formances in Pitt Player shows of
the year, Molly Ortinberg, BA41,
president of Theatron, made the
presentations.

Miss Tully was chosen by a spe-
cial committee of Theatron judges
and Buell Whitehill, assistant pro-
fessor of English, ior her outstand-
ing work in “High Tor” by Maxwell
Anderson. She appeared as Lise,
the only feminine member of an
ancient Dutch crew shipwrecked on

the paLisades of the Hudson river. '

Her love affair with a live man was
responsible for most of the exciting
episodes of the drama.

Harter had the distinction of
being selected by the committee for
outstanding work in two plays. As
the long-suffering but optimistic
poet of “My Heart’s in the High-
lands” by William Saroyan, he pro-
vided m-ost of the action. His finest
performance was in the role of Mr.
Bonaparte in “Golden Boy,” by
Clifford Odets. The humble, jov-
able father of the pugilistic violin-
player was responsible for project-
ing most of the pathos and humor
into the play.

Final Accounts

HULDA TULLY
for her an Oscar

Harter is the last Pitt Player in
a family of Pitt Players. Earl was
the ﬁrst of the family to win act-
ing Laurels, appearing in “Kind
Lady.” Miriam, who graduated last
year, spent three years in Players,
and also played an important role in
“Kind Lady.” Harter himself has
been active in his three years at
the University, playing a leading
role in “Counsellor-at-Law” last
year.

Miss Tully, also long active in
Players, appeared in “Our Town”
three years ago.

ﬁne-rllhird of Present Law Students Are Subject
To Draft Calls During Coming Surnm er Months

Concrete attempts by the School
of Law and by students themselves
to ease the difficulties imposed on
law school students by selective
training have come about in the
past week. The moves, not directly
related, are the direct result of the
possibility that about one-third of
the present student body of the
graduate school face draft calls dur-
ing the next few months.

Eligibility
Law studenlts are particularly
availabie for call into military

service. Nearly all are over 21
years of age, they are not engaged
in national defense industries, most
are unmarried, and few earn
enough money to have dependents.
Draft plans-for the coming year are
such that there is little chance for
deferment of these students during
the school year, so that there is
every possibility that a number of
them would be called while the

school is in session, missing all
the work up to the time of their call
and the full year they are in serv-
ice.

Four Terms

To cut to a mimmum the time lost
by law students called in the draft.
the School of Law announced this
week that the curriculum and tui-
tion plans would be changed for
the coming year. Instead of two
semesters, the year will be divided
into four terns, and tuition of $300
for the year will be divided into $75
for each term.

The advantage of this system is
that a student will be able to re-
enter classes at the point where his
military service interrupted them
the year before. This is made pos-
sible through a system of longer
hours devoted to each subject dur-
ing each term so that no subject will
extend two terms.

A number of students from the
next year's senior class last week

petitioned the State Supreme court
in Philadelphia to modify the rules
to permit them to attend a summer
session and make up one se1nester’s
work so that they will graduate
next January, six months ahead of
schedule. The rules of court pro-
vide that three calenda: years of

‘work are required to be eligible to

take the bar examinations.
W’crld ‘Var I

Students enrolled in the Univer-
sity in undergraduate and graduate
courses during the last war were
urged to remain in school and were
organized into the SATC—Student
Army Training corps. All male
students took military training.

The United States has not entered
the war, but peace-time conscrip-
tion has had a similar effect upon
the student of today—especially the
unmarried male student over 21
years of age. 2

Featuring ‘You’
Owl To Be Distributed

Tomorrow and Friday

Shouting “You” instead of“Who”
the 1941 Owl makes its appearance
on campus and will be ready for
seniors between 12:30 and 5 o’clock
in the Owl oﬁice, 803 Cathedral, to-
morrow and Friday.

William Sheris. BA4l, editor of
the Owl, has announced a schedule
to ease the distribution of the 312-
page book. ’

Only‘ Seniors in the School of
Business Administration and Col-
lege can procure Owls tomorow.
Seniors in all the other schools—
dentistry, education, engineering,
and pharmacy will be able to ob-
tain their books Friday. Under-
graduates can claim their copies of
the Owl beginning Monday of next
week.

Late Orders

Selwyn Loeb, BA41, business
manager, reminds everyone to bring
his receipt and the balance due on
the book. Very few extra books
are available this year and students
who wish to buy a copy should
make their orders early. The Owl
sells for $5.

The Owl oﬁice will be open
every afternoon next week for dis-
tribution of Owls to all undergrad-
uates and any seniors failing to
get a yearbook tomorrow or Friday.

The make-up of the book is con-
centrated on a scrap book idea.
For the ﬁrst time in its history,
the Owl is bound between wooden
covers of light walnut. The back-
bone and binding are of dark brown
leather, and the title and year num-
ber are stamped in gold.

Scattered throughout the book
are panels of informal poses of all
students, seniors and undergrad-

uates, in various phases of campus

life. The pictures in these panels
further carry out the scrap—book
effect. They give -the appearance of
being mounted on gray cardboard
and comments are written in white
ink.

Senior Photos

The ﬁrst eight pages in the Owl
of every senior who ordered a book
willhave his picture in a 3 by 5
oblong cut, showing through four
double page spreads. This was
done by pasting the individual’s pic-
ture on the eighth page and cutting
out sections in the ﬁrst seven pages.

The body of the Owl is highlight-
ed by a unique Hall of Fame. In
this section, pictures of the out-
standing seniors are accompanied
‘by their caricatures and signatures.

Following the Hall of Fame in
consecutive order are organizations,
honorary and professional fraterni-
ties, music, sports, and social

highlights of the year.

In this last section are included
the dances of the year and the
social fraternities.

Defense Job

Courses Given

Free defense courses in intro-
ductory engineering and other tech-
nical subjects will be offered by the
University this summer as part of
the Engineering Defense Training
program sponsored by the US Oﬁice
of Education.

Upon recommendation of their
high school principal and a college
representative, any high school
graduate of this or of recent years
may enroll in the 10-week course,
provided that he intends to go into
industry upon completion of the
course. College graduates seeking
employment may take the course as
a means of training themselves for
some speciﬁc position.

College undergraduates are not
permitted to enroll in any course
under this system, unless it is their
intention to secure employment im-
mediately.

This training will equal a full
year of night school, according to
J. S. Lambie, director of EDT
courses at the University. Begin-
ning immediately after the close of
the present school term, the courses
will operate on a full daytime,‘ﬁve-
day-a-week schedule.

The basic training offered in ele-
mentary engineering subjects, such
as chemistry, physics, drafting,
mathematics, and mechanics, will
qualify men for better jobs in in-
dustry and for future work in spec-
ialized courses in operation inspec-
tion, tool design, testing, production
engineering, drafting, metallurgy,
and fuel technology. . '

Oatstanding Pledge Fatally .
Injured on Sunday Evening

Funeral services were conducted yesterday for Joseph Cohen, Uni-
versity freshman who was killed last Sunday night by a hit—run driver
Attending the services were members of Cohen’s fraternity, Phi
Epsilon Pi, who had recently selected him as outstanding freshman pledge.

JOSEPH COHEN «
‘hit-run victim

Fraternity pins were worn with
black crepe ribbons in respect for
Cohen who was killed 24 hours be-
fore he was to have been initiated
into the fraternity.

Some of Cohen’s fraternity broth-
ers saw him struck down by the
hit-run auto almost directly in
front of the chapter house. He was
returning to his brother’s car,
paiked at the corner of Bayard and
Neville street, after having spoken
to friends across the street, when
he was hit by the auto which did
not stop. He was taken to Monte-
ﬁore hospital where he died Sun-
day at midnight.

Cohen, a member of the Pitt
News business staff, was graduated
from Taylor Allderdice High school
last year where he was pitcher for
the baseball team.

Arraigned. in the Central police
court Monday, Dickerson. told
-Magistrate VVilliam' D. McC1elland
that he drove off because the body
frightened him.

Aldisert and Alger
Both Begin “’ith “A”

We are proud to reprint the following edi-
torial on an editor. Now that Rugy is gone, we
can say:

As thousands of young men and women pre-
pare for commencement exercises, no longer
can it be said today’s college youth receive their
sheepskins with no knowledge of the working
world to come.

Vivid example of this is Ruggero Aldisert,
who has been named the outstanding senior in
a graduating class of 1,312 at the University of
Pittsburgh. Ruggero, without ever becoming
a “grind,” combined a job with his college course.

Several summers he helped with publicity
for the Allegheny County Fair at South Park.
During another period he was copy boy in the
Sun-Telegraph news room. Even with his jobs,
he managed to ﬁnd time for school activities.
Starting out as a reporter on the Pitt News,
Ruggero became its editor in his senior year.
At the same time he was president of Omicron
Delta Kappa fraternity.

He, like so many other graduates, is proof
that the “will to succeed” is still a living thing
and not an outmoded fable of Horatio Alger
days.

Wl1o’s Nostalgic, Etc?

About a year ago, or thereabouts, I started what I
fondly thought would be a column for the Pitt News.
For one issue it was a column, thereafter it was ex-
tinct, or at least dormant. Today I revive my column,
with no great expectations for its future. I know it
has no future. It is the beginning of the end. I know it is
a farewell column, a swan-song, a good-bye forever. It
is “30.”

I know why senior staff
men are expected to write
farewell columns; space has
to be ﬁlled somehow, and
why use the ramblings of an
undergrad when you can
get the sage words of a
senior. However, I don’t
know why senior farewells
have to sound like the part-
ing of Gabriel and Evan-
geline.

  

 

Irving
Vile Love Him
I know, in my case at least, I’m no Gabriel, and the
Pitt News, despite its many virtues, is no Evangeline.
The News and I part with mutual respect and admira-
tion.

I respect the News’s ability to arrive on campus
every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, although I am 0011'’
stantly amazed that it does so. I respect the News’s
ability to garble even a simple name like Smith; that
garbling shows considerable ingenuity.

I’m Not . . .

I admire the News’s ability to keep so many hungry
people away from dinner, and its ability to keep so
many avid scholars away from their books.

I admire a publication that can survive Friday night
waste-basket ﬁres; people who complain about their
names in Pittpourri; people who complain about their
names not in Pittpourri; etc. -

On the News’s part, I think it respects me for being
the guy who discovered a certain bottle containing a
certain something that was hidden away in the ﬁle
cabinet. I think the News respects me for not drink-
ing the whole bottle myself.

I think the News respects me because I can enter
into a learned discussion with the make-up editor
about pica’s and em’s, although I haven’t the faintest
idea of what kind of type you set pica or when you
use 24 or 30 point ems.

. . . I Should Worry . . .

I think the News respects me because I never write

long memos to staff members about misplaced commas,

' semi-colons, or stories. Not only do I not write to the

staff, but I have never bothered about securing a sec-

retary, which has increased my standing immensely

among the unattached females on the Pitt News, All
American.

I am quite sure the News admires me because I
can blithely go over the most complicated lay-out
sheets, discuss their good points, and their bad points
without an inkling of what the lines, stars, column
inches, x’s, breakovers, arrows, 10 on 12, 2 col. set bf.,
ital or Bod really mean.

The News holds me in high esteem because I can
buzz around the office for four hours, appear frantically
busy, not do a thing, and at the deadline neatly shift
my editorial assignment to some other guy who has
already written three edits, one lead story, and sev-
eral mashnotes. I am in fact, the best broken ﬁeld
runner on the paper. I can dodge a nasty assignment
with much more eclat than the average editorial as-
sistant.

. . . I’m Finished

What really convinced me of the News high esteem
for me was the time a tremendous story broke on a
Tuesday night and necessitated redoing the whole pa-
per. I was given the accolade by being the only de-
partment head not called up at midnight to work on
the remake. In fact I slumbered peacefully through
the News’s one and only scoop of the past several
years. You have to be good to merit such consider-
ation.

My opinions on local and world affairs rate so
high that I get to do all the editorials that carry no
weight or signiﬁcance whatsoever. I see no reason why
my writing should suddenly assume importance, there-
fore this column.

In closing my monograph on “Myself and the News,”
I want to borrow an epitaph, which is applicable to
either myself or the News. The epitaph follows:

“I have been a good boy, full of peace and quiet,

I shall have an old age full of rum and riot.”

—Irv Kaufman.

The Pitt News

Warlines . . .

Today, the question o_n the minds of all Americans
is, “What shall we do about the war in Europe?” The
last democracy on earth must prepare to take some
very drastic action. Whether fascism can best be kept
from America by our entrance into war, or by some
other method, must be decided now.

My conviction is that the United States will not

enter the European conﬂict. I shall show why this is

so and then point out what must be done.
The Constitution, as everyone knows, says that Con-
gress shall have the right to declare war. This power

is not in the hands of the President in spite of the fact
that he is made commander-in-chief of the army and
navy by that same document.

Since the ultimate decision rests with the legis-
lative bodies in Washington, the United States is not
likely to enter Europe’s war. Now there is extreme
tension concerning our likelihood of succumbing. Such
a feeling can easily be produced by a minority of peo-
ple, made up, for example, of fugitives from Wall
street, war mongers, and British propagandists.

No Periphrasis

That we wish to remain at peace, however, does
not require the dissertation of a Philadelphia lawyer
for the proof. All that need be done is to look at the
record. According to the Gallup poll for May, after
the Balkan invasion, about 79 per cent of the people
asserted that they wished to stay out of war.

Keeping this majority in mind, the next point to
note is that Congress reﬂects the voice of its con-
stituents. The act is not probable that Congress would
ever go against the majority will of the people. And
FDR is too level-headed a man to try to force the war-
issue with a dis-united country behind him.

Hence, the chief necessity of our country is to solve
home problems-—not to go to war. And I consider
building a national defense which can insure supremacy
in the Western Hemisphere a home problem. Next,
most people admit that if America were to face a com-
pletely hostile Europe, its weak spot would not be
attack from without. Invasion from within, rather, is
the greatest blow which democracy must encounter.

Fascist Seeds

Even today our country suffers from strikes, under-
production, impending inﬂation, temporary employ-
ment, war time prosperity, and a poorly equipped army.
Each of these problems contains a seed which, if not
checked, can give birth to a fascist America. It is
not the nation which makes itself increasingly power-
ful in military and economic affairs which becomes a
dictatorship; rather is it the country which permits
these internal cancers to spread and cause it to lose
its stability.

America and the Western Hemisphere must take
steps to insure its solidarity. We need the most pow-
erful defensive forces—-army, navy, and airplane——in
the world. The problems of unemployment, inequality
in opportunity and wealth, and royal refugees and
British propagandists in our government, should all
be wiped off the slate.

Realistic England

England is very realistic about this war. She ﬁghts
to save her empire, not to free “enslaved” peoples from
fascism. Forgotten except to history is official British
recognition of Italian conquests of Albania and Ethi-
opia. England ﬁghts this same Italy today. Nazism
was not repulsive to England prior to 1939. Before that
time, many British, including the late ambassador,
Lord Lothian, were the respecters of Nazi Germany.

The time has come for America to adopt some
realism for itself. If we allow idealism to rule us and
we now go to war, we shall come out a land econom-
ically exhausted and unbalanced by a costly struggle.
This result plus the disillusionment of a post—war
awakening will be most fertile soil for fascism. A
Hitler-type America would result even though we
should have entered war to prevent it. For this move-
ment does not stop with the death of Hitler. It con-
tains much more than personalities.

.-glanclazul and Wedlh

. By WILLIAM BANKS

Fallacy No. l: “The Living
Standard of a People Depends up-
on the Natural Wealth of a Coun-
try.” That is, a country abounding
in raw materials is regarded as
“rich;” the United States has large
ﬁelds of coal, iron, etc., and natural
graneries and extensive orchards,
Americans, therefore, are a rich
people. It follows, to those who
believe in the fallacy of natural
wealth, that every American should
be materially well off. The true
picture, of «course, is a rather sad
one as regards the poor whites of
the south and the nomadic slaves
of the western fruit farms. What
is lacking?

Let’s start with a dose of com-
mon sense.

In the ﬁrst place, is it not an in-
congruity that poverty and plenty
can exist side by side in America,
that the country can be divided in-
to- zones of prosperity and ones of
eternal depression. It is, on the
contrary, quite» natural that north-
eastern United States is very rich
and will remain rich; that south-
eastern United States is very poor
and will remain poor; that any in-
dustry, regardless of its location,
will enjoy relative good fortune if
it produces a product like steel,
which commands a good market
price; that conversely, any indus-
try which produces a commodity
like cotton, which commands little
price whatsoever in a world choked
with cotton, will enjoy nothing but
bad fortune, if such can be enjoy-
ed. It is, therefore, quite proper,
and will always be quite proper,
for the negro worker of the cotton
ﬁelds’ to receive an insufﬁcient few
cents per hour, while, in Pittsburgh
the welder or riveter is being paid
$10 per day.

0 Economic Misery

These facts are obvious. Yet
what a vast majority of people can
not realize them. What a vast ma-
jority have challenged administra-
tions, political programs, even our
form of government, on the grounds
that there are extremes of eco-
nomic misery in this “rich” country
of ours. Naturally, these extremes
exist. They exist now, they will al-
ways exist, they should exist.

This fallacy, if it were properly
exploded, could prevent a hundred
wars.

War psychology has always at-
tracted people through its promises
of material gain. The reasoning
is as simple as it is false. Glibly, the
war-monger, aided by newspapers,
public speakers, and the majority
notion of a country, urges a cam-
paign of war on the theory that
new lands will be won, new peo-
ple conquered, new fortunes amass-
ed. Germany ﬁghts to increase the
borders of the Reich; England ﬁghts
to hold on to her far-ﬂung empire;
Russia, her peasants miserably poor
though she is the largest national
state in the world, etches in more
and more bits of land to her enorm-
ous holdings.

O The Ohio Valley

Yet the living standard of an in-
dividual is not determined by the
size of his country or its richness
in natural goods. If the Ohio val-
ley were to maintain its production
of market-attractive steel, and were
the rest of the country to become
a vast and quiet desert, the ma-
terial well-being of the valley
would be as high as it is today.
Conversely, were the entire coun-
try to flow in milk and honey, with
the exception of southern states
which produced market-unattrac-
tive cotton, the people of those
states would remain poor and peas-
ant-like.

The Joad family, urged on by
ranting administration leaders,
might send three generations of
sons to ﬁght in American imperial-

istic wars, and those wars might in-
crease the political domination of
the United States till it covered half
the world, yet every hook-wormed
Joad would remain without shoes,
and every under-nourished Joad
neighbor remain unfed.

O Painful Truth

Throughout the world, nations
have been painfully introduced to
the cruel truths of the fallacy of
natural wealth. Unfortunately, few
have learned.

The people of Italy should know
how prosperous a war-like, victori-
ous country can be. In 1918 their
soldiers came home to a spaghetti-
less land of poverty and economic
desolation, despite the “glorious
victory” of Italian arms, despite the
sacriﬁce of 600,000 men. For that
matter, how much better off was
the miner of the British -coal ﬁelds,
or the peasant of the French farms,
after his country had won a terri-
ble four years war and increased
its empire to the tune of number-
less protectorates and German col-
onies? To bring the illusion up to
date, to what extent is the Nazi
robot more materially wealthy?
Despite the conquering and division
of France, despite the extending of
the Reich frontiers over Northern
Europe and the Balkans, the aver-
age German is still eating wood-
pulp, wearing coal-derived suits,
and washing with beneﬁt of sharp-
tipped sand.

H-ow much longer shall the world
wallow in this cruel confusion?
Who shall be the ﬁrst to open a
general eye and bring peace?

Alldred Room
Gets New Books

New books placed in the Alldred
room within the past week in-
clude “Finland Forever” by Hud-
son Strode and “Turkey” by Emil
Lengyel.

“Finland Forever” is a compre-
hensive survey of the Firms at
peace and at war. The book opens
with a quotation by Sigrid Undset,
“The Finns are the most gifted of

all people.” Then in an informal
essay style Strode, who perhaps
more than any other Amer-

ican knows and loves Finland, tells
of its people and the modern so-
ciety they built.

Emil Lengyel’s “Turkey” is a
more ambitious work than “Fin-
land Forever.” Lengyel has set
himself the task of telling the
story of Turkey from the time of
the emergence of the Turkish
tribes from central Asia to the
creation of modern Turkey. It
embraces all the ramiﬁcations of
medieval and modern Turkish his-
tory; in so doing it paints a re-
markably graphic picture of the
Turkish people and .'presents a
sound analysis of their national
traits and character.

Other new books in the Alldred
room include “Mine Eyes Have
Seen” by Alfreda Witherington,
the ﬁrst story of an American
woman doctor, and Sylvia Thomp-
son’s latest novel, “The Gulls Fly
High.”

Care of the Pitt News

Wednesday, May 21, 1941

From

-A toz

By Alex Zelenski,
Sports Editor

Thank you Mac and goodbye. In four years of coverage for
the Pitt News you have practically seen everything. From the
Golden Panthers dream backﬁeld to Pitt’s ﬁrst year of Intercol-
legiate baseball; from fumbles on the two inch line to 97 yard punts;
from the Blue and Golds in-and-out basketball teams of a few
years back to this year’s championship combination. Yes, Mac
we think you ’ve seen practically everything.

Next year is another year for Pitt athletics, and we hope that
we will see everything. In the fall coach Bowser and his under-
rated football team will trip many of the so-called powers in the
Big Ten. The Panthers first team will be a powerhouse, especially
the backﬁeld. Eddy Jones, Ralph Fife, and possibly the few of the
other boys will get mention in the annual All-American lists. '\Ve
still remember the day that you told us that when, and if Pitt got
into the Big Ten it would make a swell story. Y\'e'll remember.

A Bow to M itterling

Ralph Mitterling showed this year that he is a top-ﬂight base-
ball coach. His handling of primadonna football and basketball
players and moulding them into the best baseball squad in this
area rates him among the leading psychologists. Now, Mac,
you know that coach Carl Olsen of the thinclad squad will go on
for years developing na.tional champions. Just like “old man
river.” Next year should be no exception for with boys like Carter
and Stickel around another IC4A championship is not too remote.

Art Underwood surprised everyone this year with his re-
markable coaching of the golf team. Students always regard the
linksmen as just another phase of the athletic department, usually
a lower phase. Sometimes they are right, but this year they met’
some of the top-notch golf teams in the country and came out with
a better than average mark. Next spring, Mac, Kramer, Simpson,
Vilalkinshaw, and Butcher will be back to haunt the eastern leaders,
and we may be able to use those large size heads over a golf story,
something we ’ve never been able to do.

Till We Meet Again

Unfortunately, the tennis team is not faring so well. Their
competition is reputed to be the best in the country, and the local
boys are not. Coaches O’Laughlin and Hartwig have done their
best, and are looking forward to next year. Ben Grady ’s swimmers
did not win their usual cup at the Eastern Collegiate Swimming
association meet, but gave the victors quite a scare. Gus \Vilde,
and brother Ralph gave excellent accounts of themselves this Ylar,
and should make the backbone of the team next winter.

Basketball under the old masters, Doc Carlson, came through
after three lean years to travel as far as the national semi-ﬁnals
before bowing to a team that they beat earlier in the season, “lis-
consin. Straloski, Port, Klein, Milanovitch, and Kocheran will not
be back next winter, but Carlson has quite a number of excellent
reserves in Swacus, Malarkey, Ziolkowski, and Paffrath. Mac, you
probably got a great thrill out of these players, for you saw them
when they were nothing but raw recruits. You saw them developed.
You’re right, Carlson is quite a coach.

Last, but not least is the intramural program. You remeniber
the days you walked the Trees hill, sat in the rain watching intra-
mural games, and covered winter basketball games in the cold,
dreary Stadium. Now really don’t you think that this is one of
the best programs we’ve ever had. James Potts did a ﬁne job, but
the intramural job takes more than one man. \Ve admit that there
were forfeits, too many in fact, but better competition in each
league kept things moving along at a fast pace.

Well, Mac, that about covers this year ’s athletic teams. Next
year’s should be as good or shall we be optimistic and say better
than this year ’s teams. We hate to see the seniors graduating, and
we hate to see you go. Thank you Mac and goodbye.

Middie N etmen

Blank Panthers
At Annapolis

George Washington
Drops Match to Pitt

It seemed that the University of
Pittsburgh tennis team just couldn’t
shake that 50-50 jinx. The Panti -
er racquetmen almost did it last
Friday in the nation’s capital, when
they downed George Washington,
8 to I.

That made the season's record 4
won and 3 the other way. But the
next day, the Middle netmen at An-
napolis handed the Panthers a 9-0
lacing and once again everything
was even.

In Again, Out Again

In the George Washington en-
counter, Goehring, Trimble, C-rance,
Nickeson, and Reese took points in
the singles matches, with Goenger
annexing the only defeat. Cap-
tain Goehring took his victory by
way of default.

Trinible won easily in two sets,
6-1 and 6-0. The other victorious
scores showed Grance, 6-2 and 6-3,
Nickeson, 6-4 and 6-4, and Reese
taking a double 6-2 win.

Each of the three doubles teams
met with success. Nickeson and
Reese won 6-1, 6-0, Trimble and
Grance had to go three sets to win
—1-6, 7-5 and 8-6, and Goehring
and Gaenger won because of a de-
fault.

It was a different story at Annap-
olis, however. Not one of the
Panthers found it possible to break
into the win column. Navyman
Joe Hunt is known as one of the
most competent racquet wielders in
the country and his love victory
over Ed Goehring was not sur-
prising.

In Again

As the various scores deﬁnitely
show, not only was Hunt far su-
perior, but every other member of
the squad performed like a poten-
tial champion.

First year man Bill Reese came
closest to a Panther victory. It
took his opponent two sets to win
and Reese was able to chalk up
three victories in each set.

But finally it took Indiana State
Teachers college to bring the Pan-
ther netmen over the “hump” for
the ﬁrst time this season as they
lost all their games to Pitt Mon-
day afternoon on the Trees courts,
7-0.

The local netters opened with
veteran Ed. Goehring blasting out
an easy 6-3, 6-4 victory over No.
1 Indiana Teachers player, Bill
Bruno. Trimble then followed with
a two set win over Marley of In-
diana, and the rest was quite
simple for Pitt.

The only match of the day that
Pitt had trouble in was the ﬁnal
doubles game. Gaenger and Nick-
eson teamed up to go three sets
before beating Jamison and Hoag
of Indiana Teachers.

Pitt Track Team Faces Army Cadets
In Final Tuneup Before IC 4.»-A Meet

Looking towards the ICAAAA
championships, May 30 and 31,
Panther track and ﬁeld athletes
will use the meet with the Army
cinder men at West Point this Sat-
urday. May 24 as the ﬁnal tuneup
towards the successful defense of
their crown at Randall’s Island.

Although defeated by Ohio State
and Indiana, coach Carl Olson’s
troupe will be favored to capture
their third victory in ﬁve starts.
Pitt has steadily improved since the
upset defeat at the hands of the
Buckeyes. After beating Penn State
and losing to Indiana, newly-crowru
ed Big Ten titleholders, by a scant
one-third point, the Blue and Gold
tT.iincla.is hit a new high in scoring
last Saturday, defeating the Tem-
ple Owls on a rain-soaked track,
931.”.-32’,’2.

Panthers Impressive

True, the .Philadeiphia squad
failed to offer much in the way of
opposition, but the ease with which
the Panthers waltzed their events
was impressive enough to start
ICAAAA talk. Even though the
Army team did defeat the Lions,
the Pitt squad seems to be quite
capable of taking the Cadets right
in stride.

Chief trouble—maker for the
Panthers at West Point is expected
to be Bill Gillis, a hurdler of some
renown. Both hurdlers in Joe
Newman and Hap Stickel will be
required to step to win from the
Army ﬂyer. Stickel seems a much
better bet, however, in his specialty,
the low hurdles than l‘Iew“.':;an
does in his.

A Double Hurdle Victory

Newman copped both hurdle
events last Saturday, but his time
of 15.5 seconds in the high timbers,
even on a wet track, doesn’t look
too promising against Gillis. Stickel
hit three hurdles in grabbing third
behind Newman and Bullet Bill
Carter in the lows last Saturday,
but doesn’t ﬁgure to have the same

CARL OLSON

trouble two Saturdays running.

In dual meet competition thus
far this season, Jim Elliott, husk
junior javelin ‘iosser, has faileci t
meet any really top-ﬂight compe-
'tion. This Saturday will be dif-
ferent. He will havc to hit close
to 200 feet to win. Against Temple
he hurled the spear 188 feet 7
inches

O‘<2

Anderson Should Repeat

No other trouble  expected un-
less it occurs in the one mile run.
Since Del Anderson has very little
competition in the 880, he will prob-
ably run both events again to lessen
Army scoring chances. In the
Panther-Owl fracas he won them
both, the mile run being his first
race at that distance this year.
His time was 4133.7, and he loafed
the ﬁI'SL three laps.

Ever since Regis Larkin’s victory
over the famed Campbell Kane in
the Indiana meet, Pitt track fans
have been speculating as to his pos-
sibilities in the ICAAAA quarter
mile. His stock went higher as a

Five IF Teams Fight for Lead
As Mushball Race Nears End

With ﬁnals less than two weeks away, rnushball leads the parade of

intramural athletics into the home stretch.

The fraternity league race

is tied tighter than in any previous year for three teams are within one
game of the leading Phi Gam-Phi Ep squads.

Today’s outstanding contest ﬁnds the Phi Eps meeting the Sigma
Chi nine at 5 o’clock on Shadyside ﬁeld. The Phi Eps currently are one

of the teams tied for the lead in
the Greek circuit thanks to the
steady hurling of Jay Silverberg
and the powerful hitting of Wally
Hirsch, Joe Coplin, and Ellis
Schecter. ‘They shouldn’t have
much trouble with Sigma Chi, who
have joined the also-rans.

Mike Sotak, Frank Dax, and
company meet the Pi Lams tonight
in another game that will go a long
way in deciding the winner of the
fraternity league cup. Sotak, ace
pitcher of the Phi Kaps, and Dax,
his battery—mate and sluger deluxe,
are the main cogs in this powerful
outﬁt. However, the Pi Lams, with
Marty Faberman on the hill and
‘Irwin “Hank” Greensberg doing the
heavy hitting, are not to be passed
off as just another team. A Pi
Lam victory would not be too sur-
prising.

Rounding out the day’s games as
far as fraternities go, the Phi Delts
and Lambda Chi’s play each other
just for the exercise, as neither
team is going anywhere.

Tomorrov»/’s feature attraction
will be the encounter between the
Phi Gams and the Sammies. Led
by Bill Colvin and Bobby Thurbon,
the Fijis were in ﬁrst place all alone
until they were upset by the Delts
last week. The Sammies are ﬁn-
ishing a disappointing season, but
still can make plenty of trouble fo:
the other contending teams.

The lack of time has crowded the
schedule and thus the Phi Eps
must play again tomorrow, but their
game today will probably be just
batting practice for tomorrow’s en-
counter with Lambda Chi, who are
just playing out the schedule.

Fred “no hit” Davis wouldn’t have

any trouble at all with the SAE’s
as he endeavors to keep his Pi.KA
near the top of the circuit. Be-
sides pitching a good game, Davis
can also be counted upon to drive
in his share of runs.

Other games scheduled for tomor-
row in the Greek league are the
contests between Theta Chi and the
Pi Lams, SAE and Sigma Chi.

result of Indiana’s Jenkins placing

second in the Big Ten quarter-mile.
The time Larkin turns in at the US
Military academy should be the
determining factor in rating him a
possible point winner the following
week.

Naturally the work of the junior
sprinting and pole vaulting acts
will conzinue to be watched with
interest. The sprinting duo of Car-
ter and Stickel is once more click-
ing with the same deadly accuracy
it did all indoor season, until the
time that Stickel pulled a muscle.
 is also hurdling now, so they
threaten to add second place in the
hurdles to the total they already ac-
cumulate in the sprint and broad
jump.

In the pole vault, Dusty Rhoades
and Red Jessup have had no compe-
tition all season with the exception
of the Penn State meet. Last Sat-
urdav the latter hit 13 feet six inch-
es aga’n, while Jessup stopped in
second place at 12 feet six to rest
an "njured leg.

Twenty six of 35 decision debates
were won by the l-:'Ien's Debating
association during the past year,
according to Charles W. Lomas, di-
rector, as he released a summary
of the year’s activity.

Participation in a total of 114
events whicli included symposia.
cxtemporaneous speaking contests,
parliamentary assemblies and com-
mittees, in addition to the regular
debates, made this years associa-
tion the most successful in recent
years, according to Lomas.

Over 9.000 people listened to the
debaters during their year-long sea-

son. The largest crow s of the
year witnessed the series of de-
bates with Western Reserve uni-

versity on the question “Resolved:
That the Powers of the Federal
Government Should be increased,”
and attended the Delta Sigma Rho,
national debaters fraternity con-
vention proceedings in Chicago in
April.

Lomas pointed out that most sig-
niﬁcant one of the accomplishments
of the year is the increase in the
number of symposia and parliamen-
tary assemblies in place of the reg-
ular debates.

Outstanding debater awards of
the season were ﬁrst place in the
Great Lakes speech tournament at
Berea, Ohio, and second place in
the Westminster college tournament
in which 14 colleges and universi-
ties took part.

eading men in the association
were Fred Robie, Ed4l, retiring
va.r:::ity manager, Sam Rodgers,
C41, and William Seyler, C41, var-
sity manager—elect tor the next
school year. .

New ofﬁcers 1” or next year include
Holbert Carroll, C43, manager of
high school relations, and Robert
Sullivan, C43, secretary-treasurer,
who will head the staff. Other
members include William Clemmer,
C43, chairman of extension audi-
ences; Edward Baldridge, C43,
chairman of campus and intra-city
events.

Student Opinion Survey Serves

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

Austin, Tex., May 2l—Three
years in the making, a self-portrait
of the American Collegian is ready
today.

On more than 200 campuses from
coast to coast, student interviewers
have been conducting the Student
Opinion Surveys of America, an
organization ﬁnanced by the Uni-
versity of Texas student publica-
tions and sponsored by the coun-
try’s leading college newspapers,
including the Pitt News.

Democratic through and through,
awake to the social problems of the
day, even more emphatic in his be-
liefs than his elders—that is the
kind of student found among the
majority of the million and a half
now occupied in. the process of

higher learning in this nation. Stu-

Reporter on Student Unions Discusses Completion

 0f Theater, Banquet Hall, Litnclt Carriers’ Room

(Editor’s note: Following is the
last in a series of seven articles
"LUTitl1Q7L by staff writer Fred Lange

. on student unions and what ‘Pitt
oﬁ‘e7's similar to union junctions.)

These rooms which will perform

student union functions—a
T theater, a small banquet hall, and a
i room for students who bring their
 1unches——may soon be completed
within the Cathedral.

i 1 Beneath the ground ﬂoor of the
5 Cathedral is a huge room, cluttered
,_ with boards, mortar, and bricks. It
}has a floor of sand from which
l wooden chickenwalks lead to the
 rough concrete of the half-com-
5 pleted foundation ﬂoor. Only con-
; crete pillars separate the room from
 maintenance implements and blue-
E print tables placed against the foun-
 dation walls.

" = But more than 500 Pitt students
,may sit there someday and watch
;_moving pictures, enjoying the com-
1' fort of air—conditioning.

?, According to plans of the Cathe-
 dral, the Pitt theater is located just
iébeyond No. 1 locker room, one ﬂoor
gdown. The balcony will be built
 the same level as the locker
iroom. The entrance to the balcony

i
l‘ .
l .

is situated off the ground floor hall
leading from Lily court entrance to
the Bigelow boulevard side of the
Cathedral.

University officials declined to
comment as to when and if the
theater will be completed. Upper
ﬂoors of the Cathedral probably
will be ﬁnished ﬁrst and University
ofﬁcials expressed the belief that
there is no immediate ‘need for a
theater, especially with so many
classrooms uncomplcted.

More certain for completion are
the small banquet hall and the
lunch carriers’ room.

The old Tuck shop on the ground
ﬂoor may be completed to provide
a dining room for club and frater-
nity dinners, according to Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman.

lf such a room materializes, clubs
and fraternities, honorary or social,
will be able to serve dinners in the
Cathedral instead of scheduling
rooms in hotels. The food could be
brought in, as during the Sports
banquet, or prepared in the Tuck
shops, depending upon the facili-
ties of food preparation in the
Cathedral.

Dr. Bowman did not say when he
expected the room to be ﬁnished,

but he indicated that more than just
serious consideration was being
given to work on the banquet room.

The Chancellor also told of a
plan to open a dining room for stu-
dents who bring their lunch to the
University. He had previously
mentioned the lunch carriers’ cafe-
teria at a student assembly in Me-
morial hall last February.

Located on the ground floor, in

the Belleﬁeld-Fifth avenue corner
of the Cathedral, the luncheon room
will be similar to the men’s Tuck
shop on the eighth floor with tables
and a service counter for soft
drinks and candy. York on the
room is ercpected to be started soon.

Dr. Bovaman also told of the
need for a room in which students

could take showers and change
clothes. He pointed out that by

using such rooms the necessity of
going home to change clothes when
attending an affair at the University
in the evening would be eliminated.

Where these rooms will be lo-
cated, the Chancellor did not say,
but he stated that the importance
of all these additional union ad-
vantages in the Cathedral were
recognized and are goals to strive
for.

Numerous College Newspapers

-dent Opinion Surveys, using a
. representative cross-section to cover
every type enrolled in all types of
institutions, represents every sec-
tion of the country, mathematically
weighing each geographical divi-
sion to its proper proportion in the
national sampling. “A Gallupesque
poll,” Time magazine called it.

Analyzed from a common point
of view, 96,000 separate answers
result in the most complete con-
tinuing study yet devised to meas-
ure the attitudes of US college
'y.outh. Summarized from more
than a 100 questions polled, here is
a picture of what the students
themselves think and what educa-
tion ought to be.

Restrict Enrollment

Higher education, a good majority
believe, is not over-emphasized, as
some people would seem to think.
They conclude that education is not
even meeting present day needs.

What would they do to improve
it? The problem is obviously one
of tremendous. proportions, but
these are a few of the suggestions:
students will tell you that there
are too many campus misﬁts clut-
tering up the schools; they would
ﬁnd some way to restrict enroll-
ment. They would make sex edu-
cation courses compulsory, but at-
tendance would be voluntary to
college classes. _ _ Most_ coeds would
disparage the notion that it is more
important to ﬁnd a husband at col-
lege than to study. Final exami-
nations, 53 per cent say, are not a
fair test of a student’s knowledge
in a course. But most of them
would prefer to keep the ABC sys-
tem of giading instead of being
either passed or failed. The larger
part frown on hazing.

Thumbs up on ROTC

Over-whelmingly approved by
both men and women are ROTC
training and ivilian aviation
courses. In general, however,
higher education as the students
would plan it would point more
and more toward a wide and cul-
tural background than technical
and professional training. The war
has brought new problems. But
college students are apparently
level—headed. They approve of
military training now, but not per-
manently; they are more emphatic
about keeping out of war than are
their elders.

In one of the most emphatic votes
ever registered by Student Opinion
Surveys. 96 per cent asserted that
college administrations should have
no right to hinder a student’s per-
soral political activities or express-
ions of opinion. Only 91 per cent,

however. defended faculty mem-
bers’ right of complete academic
freedom. Most students want to

learn the facts about the “isms” in
the classroom. “But be sure the
teachers teach, not preach,” said
a middle-mid—western junior. They
want their college editors to dis-
cuss extra-mural problems of the
day; 75 per cent read editorial com-
ment in their college papers.

also been active in speech work
outside of the debating group it-
self. Rodgers won first prize in
the state-wide Peace Oratorical con-
test, while Gerald Ziskind, C41, took
up honors in the YM£e-WHA speech
contest, and second place in the
University competition.

Seniors who will be lost to the
association next year include Hobie,
Rodgers, Fred Roth, Ed; and Zis-
kind.
