The university is spending $82,000 to
redecorate new President J. Dennis
O’Connor’s office, Pitt spokesperson Tim
Ziaukas confirmed yesterday.

“The place needed to be cleaned up,”
Ziaukas said. “It is important to have the
president in a nice place where he can
meet with the important kinds of people
that a university president meets with.”

The redecorating began Aug. 1 arrd will

82,000 to re

v

be finished sometime in the fall, according
to Ziaukas. Both the president’s main
office and the reception area are being
worked on.

The project includes refinishing the
floors, buying new furniture, re-
upholstering old furniture and installing
new lights, Ziaukas said.

“The ﬂoors haven’t been done in 24
years. A lot of the 1960s decor is finally
being put to rest,” Ziaukas said.

O’Connor is currently working in another
office in his suite while the work is

e

2’

completed. -

Ziaukas said the university will not
release a detailed list of the costs involved
in the redecoration.

The money for the president’s office
came from a plants fund in the facilities-
management budget, according to Ziaukas.
The fund is reserved for one-time projects.

“It was appropriate to spend the money
on O’Connor’s office,” Ziaukas said. “I
know that O’Connor thinks it is appropriate
to spend the money to have a clean, well-
lighted place.

“I think the way O’Connor put it to me
was, ‘I want a clean football program. I
want a clean office,’" Ziaukas said.

According to English professor Myron
Taube, O’Connor’s action is typical of
administrators and businesspeople who
move into new offices. ‘

“It is wasteful, and it is stupid, but it is
done all over the place,” Taube said. “If
O’Connor wanted to make his office
prettier, why didn’t he bring in some
ﬂowers and a fluorescent lamp?”

Syria Mosque
torn down; C
City Council

refuses to halt

demolition  
By Gregory Flail

and Debbie Lincoln
Sta_[fW71_-iters

Workers besieged the Syria
Mosque with bulldozers and
sledgehamrners yesterday, almost
immediately after City Council
denied an injunction to halt the
demolition.

The Historical ‘ Review
Commission had voted yesterday
to recommend the mosque be
named an historical site, but
council ignored the
recommendation because the
mosque’s owners had obtained a
demolition permit.

The recommendation came less
than 24 hours after the arrests of
City Council member Jim Ferlo
and three others who protested
the initial steps toward the
demolition of the Syria Mosque.
Protesters climbed the sphinxes
in front of the building before the
sculptures were taken down.

‘Bill Keyes of the Historical
Society of Western Pennsylvania
said the actions taken by the
demolition crew had to do with
defacing the building, not razing
it. '

The arrest of two former officers of the
Pitt Golden Panthers athletic-booster club
reﬂects an “attitude that permeated the
administration," which ignored internal
allegations of misconduct at the university,
according to District Attorney Robert
Colville. _ -

Robert Heddleston and Keith
Fammartino, the former executive director
and former president of the Golden
Panthers, respectively, surrendered to
police Aug. 21 on charges that they placed

 

$41,627 in contributions to the club into a
secret bank account for which the two

‘were co-signers.

Heddleston, 46, who served as head of
the Golden Panthers from 1976 until his
resignation in April 1989, is also charged
with taking an additional $14,656, including
$7,100 charged to the university food
service for a wedding reception and a
$3,200 fur coat donatedto Pitt.

The charges against Heddleston carry a
maximum sentence of 40 years in‘ prison
and an $85,000 fine. The charges‘ include
four counts of theft by failure to make
required disposition of funds received,

Two aested in Golden Panthers investigation

one count of criminal conspiracy and one
count of theft of services.

Fammartino’s charges include one count
of failure to make required disposition of
funds received and one count of criminal
conspiracy. The maximum sentence for
these crimes is 14 years in prison and a
$15,000 fine. 4.

Colville said, “They took it upon
themselves to create a club a within the
food service involving the athletic
department.” He characterized the situation

as having “substantial ethical
mismanagement problems.”

Future of Soviet Union is uncertain

By Catherine Goldstein
sugr Writer

Since last week’s failed three- ,

day attempt by hard-liners to
overthrow Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, five
republics, most recently
Moldavia, have declared their
independence- On Saturday
Gorbachev resigned as party
chief and yesterday threatened
to leave the presidency if the
republics continue to secede.

Pitt economics Professorjanet
Chapman said the right—wing
officials who attempted the cou p
overestimated their support
from the military and the KGB.

“There was a group of‘KGB
agents who were supposed to
assassinate Boris Yeltsin, and
they didn’t even go,” Chapman
said.

“The linstigators of] the coup
miscalculated the support they
would get from the Communist
Party. They thought it would be
automatic, and to their dismay

it wasn’t. The real thing is that
the people lost their fear of the
authority,” she said.

Yeltsin has since emerged as

a national hero after organizing ‘

a resistance to the uprising.

The coup failed because
because it was disorganized and
poorly planned, according to
Ron Linden, chairperson of
Russian and Eastern European
studies. ,

“I think it was all badly
executed. The coup leaders
failed to take control of all
communication, and they failed
to secure important people like
Yeltsin. In addition, they
underestimated the fact that
people would stand up to them.
The coup leaders thought they
only had to show a few tanks,

and the people would listen '

and do what they said,” Linden
said.

Future U.S.-Soviet relations
“will be much more complicated
because we don’t know how
many republics will pull away,

and they’ll have more power
than before. We’ll be dealing
with more people — _not just
one central person or place,
like we had done before with
the Kremlin,” Chapman said.

Because the future of the
Soviet Union is unknown, “the
U.S. approach is very cautious,"
Linden said. —

“Until we see what’s left of
the republics, it’s very hard to
say how the relations will be
between the two powers. Also,
it depends on whether or not
the republics will agree with
one treaty. It’s really not clear
what’s going to happen. I’m
just watching like everyone else
and we’ll see,” said Bill Chase,
associate professor of history.

The economy will decline
before it will improve, according
to Chase.

“I’m‘ not looking forward to
the winter. I think it will be very
hard onmany people because
their economy is in the throes
of collapse,” he said.

Linden said production will
continue to decline and
distribution of food and other

supplies will be difficult,

because the Soviets need to
replaceold systems with new
ones.

“Things are in turmoil right
now, so we have to wait before
signing anything because it's
not clear to what parties the
industries belong. I think that
in the long run, it will be a

good place to invest,”
Chapman said.

“Relations will
fundamentally change

because things in the Soviet
Union have fundamentally
changed. The Soviet Union as
we have known it for the past
70 years is no longer in
existence,” Linden said.

“The dominating controlling
function of the Communist
Party is dissipating. From now
on predictions about the Soviet
Union will be risky,” Linden
said. ‘

Public hearing set for Cowell bill

By Jim Wechsler
Copy Editor

A proposed amendment to Pennsylvania’s Right
To Know law that would require state-related
universities like Pitt to fully disclose their financial
records is scheduled for a public hearing in the
state senate education committee in rnid-September.

“The committee will be holding a comprehensive
hearing on ﬁscal responsibility in higher education,”

said Helen Caffrey, director of the state senate’

education committee. The meeting will not directly
address the bill, Caffrey said, but the bill will
probably be discussed.

Bob Reteshka, a spokesperson for Pitt, said, “We

have come out on record in saying we do not-

oppose the bill in principle.”

Pitt President]. Dennis O’Connor said the bill is
a “complex issue.”

O’Connor said the bill is not speciﬁc regarding
which records fall under the proposed amendment.
As the bill reads now, it appears to allow complete
public scrutiny of all financial records, he said.

“There are some things that you wouldn’t want.

in the public domain, that shouldn’t be in the
public domain," O’Connor said. He said research
contract proposals and other confidential materials
would fall under that category.

Caffrey said‘ the senate would conduct its review
of the bill independent of outside inﬂuences,
including the state house of representatives’ verdict
The state house passed the bill by a margin of '200
to one.

The public hearing is the ﬁrst step toward a
senate vote on the bill, according to Caffrey.

The senators will then be given time to consider
the bill in light of any concerns raised at the
meeting.

The senate will then hold a meeting speciﬁcally
to discuss the bill, and a vote will probably take
place, Caffrey said.

State Rep. Ron Cowell (D.—Wilkins), who
introduced and sponsored the bill, said lobbyists
representing the universities affected by the bill
were given an opportunity to suggest amendments
before the house voted on it.

“The lobbyists for the universities  declined to
make any amendments,” Cowell said.

“The language in the Right To Know law speaks
to financial stuff. My personal opinion is that it
would apply to the research contracts,” Cowell
said. q ,

The Right To Know Law, enacted in 1957, states
that any state agency must reveal most ﬁnancial
records, including the acquisition and allocation of
money and the receipt or use of materials, equipment
and property.

State—related institutions have not had to reveal
information such as salaries and endowment funds
in the past. - '

If passed, bill 1075 would extend the Right To
KnowlLaw to private institutions such as the
University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University,
which receive state funds, as well as the four major
state-related universities, Pitt, Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln.

Further criminal charges may
be ﬁled after an investigation of
the university’s $8 million—a—year
food service operation is
completed this month, according
to Colville.

The university administration
was partly to blame, Colville said.
He said the investigation has
shown that “in many instances
people at the lower rungs found
irregularities or found unethical
practices brought it to the
attention of their bosses and their
bosses did nothing.”

Colville said allegations of
Heddleston’s wrongdoings were
brought to the attention of then-
Athletic Director Edward Bozik.

that they were, and I would

“Attitudes and ethics are set for

Posvar and‘ Bozik were
unavailable for comment.
Heddleston’s attorney, Robert

Heddleston cooperated with the
investigation. A preliminary
hearing is scheduled for Sept. 20.

- Pitt spokesperson Tim Ziaukas
said, “The process will determine

proposed amendment to the state
Right to Know act that would
make records of state-related
universities public.

“One of the things thatl think
is imperative is that there be
disclosure of expenditures of
taxpayers’ money. I cannot for
the life of me understand why
present legislators aren’t
adamantly supporting the open
auditing or open books [at the
four state-related Pennsylvania
schools],” Colville said.

Pitt students /eilled‘

in motorcyclecms/9 '  

By Renee Crespy
Recruiting Coordinator

Pitt students Nate Savage, 21, and Eric Ulmer, 23, were
pronounced dead Monday at Presbyterian University Hospital
after their motorcycle struck a tree at the intersection of Beeler
Street and Forbes Avenue at about 2 a.m.

Ulmer, the driver, was travelingat 100 miles per hour when
he missed the turn at the corner, according to Lt. Steve Starcich,

4 supervisor of the accident-investigation team.

Starcich said Savage and Ulmer were racing with two other
motorcyclists. The wreck was discovered when the other
cyclists saw a helmet roll across the street on the corner of Beeler
and Forbes.

“lUlmerl just lost control because of his speed, and they hit a
newly planted tree that was held up by metal supports,” Starcich
said. “It was evidently a race, and at 100 mph you can’t go
around a bend.”

Starcich also said Savage and Ulmer were reportedly drinking
before the accident, but the coroner's reports aren’t completed
yet. .
Student Government Board President Brent Saunders said he
was with Savage and Ulmer at C]. Barney’s, an Oakland bar, just
minutes before the accident. Saunders is a fraterniIY brother of
Savage’s.

“I had to pick up my roommate at the airport at 6 a.m., so I
wanted to go home, and Nate kept callinggme a wimp, telling
me to stick around and go with him, but I ended up leaving,”
Saunders said.

Saunders also said Savage wasn’t drunk.

“There was no way that Nate was intoxicated." Helwas [at C.J,’sl
about two hours, and he had one beer. So I know he wasn’t
drunk at all, but I don’t know about Eric,” said Saunders.

“It’s really hard,” Saunders said, “Nate was a really big part of
our lives for the last couple of years, and everyone’s going to
miss" him. It’s a tragedy.” . '

A joint memorial service is being planned for next week at
Heinz Chapel, Saunders said.

“The fraternity houses are really broken up over this,"
Saunders said. Savage was a brother in Phi Gamma Delta, and
Ulmer was in Phi Kappa Theta.

Jay Segina and Bernie Etters, members of Phi Kappa Theta
fraternity, said they will be attending Ulmer’s funeral tomorrow
night with the entire fraternity. L

“We’ll be going to the service tomorrow as a brotherhood,”
Segina said.

The Phi Kaps also plan to hold a memorial day for Ulmer later ’

in the semester. _
“We plan to have a black-badge day sometime this semester
to honor Eric,” said Etters. “To remember him.”

just to get some watermelon but
is now “thinking about rushing.”
Pitt Greeks kicked off the fall
rush yesterday with their _annual
watermelon picnic.
Fraternities and sororities
offered free watermelon and Pepsi
to allure hundreds of incoming
students to the Cathedral of
Learning Lawn to consider “going
Greek. ” They also displayed signs

with large Greek letters and

balloons.

Darin McMullen, Inter-
Fraternity Council president, was
among those enticing the sun-
weary students.

He said students should go
Greek for “the friendships that
will last a lifetime  Everyone
can find somewhere to fit in if
you give a fair look.”

Dara Mancini said, “A large‘

percentage of people join for the
networking system as well as
social opportunities. Through my
sorority I got involved with the
Student Government Board.”

According to Mancini, sororities
can. provide a positive
environment for the campus
women's community.

“Women lack role models.
Sororities can push women [to
achieve]. Lots of successful
women [as role models] are
important during your first year,”
she said. .

“It was a juicy, good piece of
melon,” according to Goldoor.
Jesse Kraft, a first-year student
from Philadelphia, said he did
not get a chance to taste the
watermelon. Many incoming
students didn’t eat any
watermelon.

Another incoming student
slipped on a piece‘ of the
watermelon but managed to
maintain her composure. _

Commenting on the importance
of the Greek system, Jason
Mendelowitz, Inter-Fraternity
Councilsocial chair, said, “You
make friendships that will last for
years.” i

Mendelowitz and McMullen
said a diverse group of people go
Greek. But McMullen said
fraternities and sororities aren't
for everyone. .

Cindy Freyvogel, a member of
the Panhellenic rush committee,
said, “Freshmen should pledge.
You’re lost when first coming
here. [Fraternities or sororities]
allow you to be ‘part of the
university.”

Freyvogel said some people
stay away from the Greek system
because they think “pledging a
sorority takes a lot of time. A lot
of people go through rush but
don’t pledge’... People should
give it a try at least.”

T iglot budget, ola’ elevators to blame for rec

By Mark Carlin
Staﬂ“ Writer

An elevator-relay failure in Tower B in

. early August sent an elevator and itsonly

president of the congress.

occupant, Martha Thorpe, on an
unintended trip from the 15th floor to the
basement, with rapid stops on the 6th and
3rd ﬂoors. ,

Thorpe, a member of the Pitt
housekeeping staff, sustained minor
injuries and was quickly treated and
released from Presbyterian University
Hospital. Thorpe, who has been
unavailable for comment, has not returned
to work.

Bob Boyce, senior facilities manager,
said, “The elevator did not overspeed and

didn’t fall. It just went at its normal full
speed with slightly abrupt stops at the two
floors and the basement.”

Boyce said it is virtually impossible for
any elevator to free fall, and in emergencies
the elevators are programmed to stop on
certain ﬂoors as the Tower B elevator did
on Aug. 8.

According to Thomas Hussey, associate
vice president for facilities management,

Pitt has a number of electro-mechanical ‘

elevators that date as far back as 1934,
instead of modern computer—operated
elevators.

v “These old elevators cause most of our
problems. Our staff does a terrific job and
works very efficiently, but you can’t
completely avoid problems with elevators

this old,” Hussey said.

Hussey said facilities management is
facing a very tight budget.

“We have taken significant reductions in
our budget, Last year the faculty and staff
were given a 7.5% salary increase, which
was paid for by budget decreases in other
areas like facilities management. We spend
almost a million dollars a year on elevator
maintenance alone. We should be on a
replacement program, installing new
elevators for old, but that would double
our budget.”

Boyce said the university operates 185
pieces of elevator and escalator equipment,
and each elevator comes with a motor and
a large bank of relay switches.

“Maintaining each elevator is

ent brea/edoums    

complicated,” Boyce said. “Considering

"the size and scale of elevator maintenance,

there are very few problems.”

The university contracts maintenance
for the elevators, and Pitt only handles
cleaning and non-routine maintenance

- including emergencies, Boyce said. “The *

elevator in Tower B was properly inspected
last May,” he said. ‘
Prime candidates for replacement might
be the Cathedral of Learning elevators,
which date back to the building's opening
in the 19505. B  A —
Nineteen students were stuck for about
an hour between the 11th and 12th floors
of the cathedral on July 2. The students
apparently exceeded the 4,000-pound
weight capacity. ‘

FK506

Continued from page 4
cyclosporine can cause
neurotoxicity (ind dissassociated
behavior. Short-term side effects
of FKSO6 include headache,
vomiting, nausea and tingling of
the feet. While patients on
cyclosporine often experience
excessive hair growth, this is not
a common problem with FKSO6,
Calne said.

Although cyclosporine and FK
506 have similar positive results
and some of the same side effects,
“there is no common ground
[between the two] any chemist
has been able to see,” according
to Calne. ‘

FKSO6 has been extremely
effective in treating children,
according to Calne.

Dr. John Armitage, an assistant
professor of surgery at Pitt said,
“Of the 19 children who
underwent heart transplantation,
16 are being managed on FKS06
alone. Freedom from rejection
after 90 days was 65 percent,
compared to 30 percent in the
previous cyclosporine era.”

Ascher said FKSO6 will soon be
tested extensively on organs other
than the liver. “By the time these
trials are done on other organs,
we will have set solid guidelines”
for FKS06 use among liver-’
transplant patients, Ascher said.

Pitt’s transplant team is also
researching FKS06’s effectiveness
in treating autoimmune diseases
such as “psoriasis.

Fung said, “To be able to reverse
severe, acute rejection with FKS06
was actually a surprise to us.
Many of these patients were facing
another transplant, It was almost
unthinkable to believe we could
stop the [rejection] process in
some of these cases, but we did.”

Cyclosporine is usually used
with hi gh-dose steroid therapy to
counteract the negative side
effects of the drug. Cyclosporine
often causes toxicity of the
kidneys, which is treated by
raising the dose of cyclosporine
and other drugs —— a practice
which increases the possibility of
rejection. Most patients on FK506
are able to discontinue using

Women in Pittsburgh who are
sexually active, unexpectedly
pregnant or in need of
gynecological care can choose
from a wide range of clinics for
care and assistance.

There are traditional clinics
providing routine gynecological
exams, contraceptives and
abortions; “alternative” clinics that
condemn abortion and clinics that
help women who choose to keep
their children.

Family Planning Services, a
program of the Family Health
Council, Inc., has three offices in
Pittsburgh which provide
reproductive health care and
contraceptives.

Luther Sheets, director of public
affairs for the FHC, said that
although the clinics do not
provide abortions, the counselors
will discuss all options for
unintended pregnancies.

Sheets said the clinics will soon
be able to provide Norplant, the
new progestin-releasing
contraceptive that is implanted in
a woman’s arm.

“We just got approval to offer
it. It will be reimbursable by the
state welfare department,” said

Sheets.

The costs of the clinics’ services
are on a sliding scale based on a
woman’s income.

“Most college students,
assuminggthey don’t have a full-
time job, would probably just
pay a nominal fee,” he said.

“If you have absolutely no
source of income, you won’t pay
anything. For an entire year of
health care and supplies it is
probably $70, although it is rare
that a college student would pay

‘the full fee," Sheets said.

Mom’s House, with locations
in Brookline and Swissvale, assists

‘ students with children.

“Mom’s House is a
comprehensive support group for
single, low-income mothers,” said
CEO Mary Winter. “Our primary
service is free child care.”

Other services include
parenting classes, tutoring and
counseling. Mom’s House
provides baby furniture, clothes
and food.

In order to qualify for Mom’s
House care, a mother must be.
single, unable to afford day care
and be a full-time student.

Winter stressed that a mother
can be a full-time student
anywhere: She mightbe in eighth
grade, in the job corps or vo-tech

“Just because you have a baby
doesn't mean you should have to
drop out of school,” Winter said.
“Education is the key to
everything, and you ought to be
able to do both.

“It’s really a practical,
progressive and compassionate
approach to the whole problem
of out—of—wedlock motherhood,”
she said.

“The mothers can break the
welfare cycle and look forward
to a brighter future with their
children.”

The seven Crisis Pregnancy
Centers in the Pittsburgh area,
although run by different
organizations, all promote
alternatives to abortion.

According to June Masiarik,
director of the CPC in Beaver
County, the alternatives include
single parenting -and adoption.

“We believein the sanctity of
human life, that every life is
precious and a gift from God,”
she said.

maternity clothes and furniture
and referrals for medical and
housing assistance.

All services are free.

According to Masiarik, whose
CPC is nationally affiliated with
the Christian Action Council, birth
control is not recommended to
prevent further pregnancies.

“We promote abstinence. We
think that’s the best way to prevent
another pregnancy,” she said.

“If a girl wants to be sexually
active, we refer her to her own
private physician,” Masiarik said.

Women's Health Services, a
traditional clinic located
Downtown, provides services on
a sliding scale.

“Ultimately no woman is ever
turned away due to lack of funds,”
said Mary Litman, director of
community education and public
relations. '

“We are a full—care reproductive
health clinic,” Litrnan said.

“We do everything from
gynecology to sex therapy. We
also do PMS counseling,

/menopause counseling and
marital counseling."

According to Litman, the top

price for counseling service is

I9

 

$80, with sliding fees down to.

$40. Pre-abortion and post-
abortion counseling is free.

WHS provides abortion
services. A first—trimester abortion
costs $330,’ and IV sedation is
available for $100.

Other clinical services include
gynecological exams, testing and
treatment for sexually transmitted
diseases, including AIDS,
counseling for people who are
HIV-positive and free pregnancy
testing daily. A

Reduced and deferred fees are
also available, and the Vivian
Campbell Fund provides
assistance for low-income
women.

Planned Parenthood, another
traditional clinic, has three offices
in the Pittsburgh area.

“We do basically routine
gynecological exams,” said
Executive Director Kim Evert.

“We also provide birth control,
cancer screening, diagnosis and
treatment of ST Ds, abortion
services and premarital exams,”
she said.

The family planning services
are on a sliding scale.

“For anyone under 17 it’s
automatically free. For everyone

' else it’s based on your income,”

said Evert.

Abortions, which cost $275,
are not offered on a sliding scale,
according to Evert.

_ Evert expressed concern about
“alternative” clinics.
“They don’t give you complete

« information,” she said. “Our main

concern is that they don’t do
options counseling.”
Birthright, an “alternative” clinic

that encourages women to carry

their pregnancies to term, has
locations in Oakland and
Lawrenceville. ‘

“Birthright is an agency that
helps people who find they are
unexpectedly pregnant,” said
director Rita Cunningham. “We’re
trying to offer them different kinds
of help and services so that they
can carry the baby to term."

The clinic provides free
pregnancy testing, counseling
referrals and baby clothes.

“A lot of people turn to abortion
because they don’t know what
else to do," Cunningham said.
“We believe even if you put the
baby up for adoption, that's a
very heroic thing to do.”

“You don’t have to change your
lifestyle for the first four or five
months,” she said.

Allegheny Women's Center is a
traditional‘ clinic located in East
Liberty.

“We have a birth-control clinic
with gynecological services, and
we also do abortions here,” said
director Kathy Spokane.

AWC does not provide sliding
fees, but it does accept insurance
as well as Visa and MasterCard.

According to Spokane, a regular
gynecological checkup costs $40,
with insurance covering the lab
costs.

Abortions cost $310, or $370
with IV sedation.

Spokane also does not approve
of “alternative” clinics.

Teach for America

Debate continues over lack of certification for teachers

By Laura Gallagher
Staff Writer

Teach For America, established
in 1987 by Princeton graduate
Wendy Copp, sends college
graduates with liberal-arts degrees
and little formal training in
education to school districts
nationwide with persistent
teacher shortages.

“One of the advantages is that
the program gives recent college
graduates a chance to teach
without going through normal
teaching routes,” said Catherine
Hottenrott, a public-relations
official at TFA.

Last year 500 college graduates
were selected from among more
than 2,500 applicants recruited
from about 100 colleges and
universities.

Hottenrott said TFA will place
739 teachers this year.

Prospective teachers go through

eight weeks of student—teaching
in Los Angeles school districts.

They then begin a two—year
commitment in areas of the United
States that permit the hiring of
teachers without degrees in
education.

School districts in Los Angeles,
New York, Baton Rouge, New

Orleans, rural North Carolina and

Georgia are presently
participating in the program.

But Charles Allen, an instructor
at the University of Pittsburgh's
School of Education, said the
eight-week training period is “not
enough time.”

“I think people have to learn in
steps," Allen said. “They need to
learn how to organize a
classroom, how to manage a
classroom and to learn about
their children, about their needs

. You learn by experience
whether or not you relate well to
children. You can't learn this in a

short period of time.”

David Kramer, a teacher at Pitt’s
Falk School, expressed mixed
feelings about TFA’s alternate-
certification program.

“I’m not saying that certification
necessarily makes a good teacher,
but you have to have some quality
control, and I guess it comes
down to a piece of paper,” he
said.

Although the 11-percent
attrition rate for the program is
“very good,” according to
Hottenrott, only 45 percent of the
participants plan to stay in
teaching.

Critics attribute this figure to
the placing of inexperienced
college’ gfaduates into already
tr ubled public-school systems.

According to Derek Whordley,
dean of Duquesne University’s
School of Education, prospective
teachers should be familiar with
the environment in which they

will be teaching.

“Students at Duquesne are
exposed to rural and urban areas, "
Whordley said.

“We owe it to the student to
simulate the real—world
experience  We don’t want
them to get an over-idealized
notion of teaching.”

’I'FA is based on the Peace
Corps model of “making a
difference.” The themes of
multiculturalism, professionalism
and reflection are stressed
throughout training.

“Teachers in the school districts
are really supportive because the
members have a real desire to
learn. They show enthusiasm in
the classroom and want to be
part of the education system,”
Hottenrott said. —

Salaries for TFA teachers range
from $18,000 to $29,000,
depending on the school district.
Participating graduates can defer

payment of their federal student
loans until their two—year
assignment is over.

Dr. Greg Morris of Pittsburgh ; '

Public Schools’ School
Improvement Program approves
of TFA.

“Our perspective gets a little 1

narrow,” Morris said, stressing
the need for educators to be
open to programs that “try to
help youngsters."

Whether they stay in teaching
or not, TFA members “will have

good perspectives...The children . V

will beneﬁt," Morris said.
Anyone interested in becoming
involved in TFA should contact
the national office in New York
City and requestan application.

Although $82,000 is a small amount
in a university that has a $600—million
budget, T aube said it is the “symbolic
meaning of the expenditure that is
important.

“That shows a lack of restraint in a
time of fiscal problems,” he said.

Taube said the situation is made
worse by Pitt's refusal to release
specifics on the costs of the project.

“That just makes it look suspicious,"
he said. .

Taube said things are much different
at the departmental level.

“If I move out of my office, the new
person that comes in will probably
bring in some new stuff to put on his

Free gifts and foo
draw students to fair

By Mark Carlin
Sta_[f Writer

With over 20,000 students, Pitt
has a lot of people looking for
something to do aside from
schoolwork. The activities fair
held in Forbes Quadrangle last
night gave those students and
anyone else who was interested
a chance to find out about campus
organizations. ,

People representing over 130
groups distributed information
about their activities and provided
food, entertainment and handouts
like plastic mugs and memo
boards.

' Organizations represented at
the fair include a wide range of
professional, recreational,
religious, artistic and political
groups. Students milled about
asking questions, munching on
freebies and watching other
students meander the Quad.

“The activities fair is a really
good idea. Last year we got most
of our new members from the
fair, and it helped us have our
largest campus membership yet,”
said Ronna Lash, a member of
Amnesty International.

Many of the organization
representatives said roughly half
of those who ‘sign up come to the
first meeting, and membership
drops slightly after that.

“Many freshmen don’t realize
how much work there is at school,
and consequently they sign up
for more groups than they have
time for,” said Pam Bolkovac of
The Society for Creative
Anachronism.

“Also, some of the clubs require
obligations that a student may
not be interested in. For instance
we require some historical
research, and students often don’t

.really want to do it,” Bolkovac

said.

Joe Secevik, student
coordinator of Hand in Hand
said, “A student who joins a
voluntary organization like ours
gets a chance to work with other
students, which may be the best
way to get to know somebody
and hopefully make friends.”

“We throw an annual festival
for mentally and physically
handicapped children and need
about 300 to 400 student
volunteers. We hope to get

between 75 and T00 through this _

fair, which is a great start,” Secevik

" said.

Some group members said they
saw themselves as providers of
information. Christine Helsel from
the Campus Women’_s
Organization said, “Just getting
some people to send our
newsletter to keeps people
informed, and sometimes they
show up at our events even if
they don’t go to our meetings.”

Tod Goodwin, a senior math L

major, said, “,1 just stopped by" to
see what was going on, and after
I wasvhere,’I' picked up a poster
and a mug.” ' '

Lisa Blaine of the Baptist
Campus Ministry was quite
pleased with the turnout. “There
is no other gathering of students
like this, and it gives us a chance
to expose ourselves to students
who might not know how to get
in touch with other Christian
students who want to share their
spirituality.”

If you were unable to’ make the
activities fair and are interested in
learning about clubs and
organizations on campus, stop
by the information desk at the
William Pitt Union. It has a listing
of many of the clubs at the fair
and a few that were not able to
attend.

A traditional college edu-
cation wasn’t an option for
Kathy Hish.

“I went" from being a high-
school dropout to being able to
make it through graduate
school. It took a lot of years to
accomplish what I wanted,”
Hish said.

"lThe College of General
Studies] gave me the confidence

undergraduate studies,” she
said.

Hish was able to complete
her degree by taking advantage
of CGS’ ﬂexible scheduling, off-
campus classes and the
University External Studies
Program.

“CGS really catered to my
needs. One of the thingsl really
liked about CGS was that the
external—studies classes
provided coffee and donuts
during the Saturday sessions.
That may sound strange, but it
made me feel welcome, and it
gave me the chance to socialize
and meet other students who
were educating themselves a
little at a time.”

Hish graduated with a
communications major in’ 1988
and went on to graduate school
at Duquesne University. .

“With three children and a
job, I didn't have much time to
attend classes. _

"I started with external studies
then worked my way from a
part-time student with six credits
to a 15—credit schedule,” Hish

keep an objective viewpoint, but when I saw that they
had deliberately defaced the building, the side facing the
Veterans’ Memorial, it sickened me,” Keyes said. “It was
unnecessary. It was like saying, ‘This is what you value,
so this is what we destroy.’ 

“The other thing I find pretty shocking is that it's all
being done for the University of Pittsburgh. I ’m sure that
[Beaver Valley Demolition] is not in contact with the
president, but these are the kind of people the university
is affiliated with. Defacing that [building] is a message,”
he said.

The University of Pittsburgh originally bid for ownership
of the mosque last spring but wasgoutbid by approximately
$5 million by the National Development Corporation,
which-« was acting on behalf of Presbyterian University
Hospital, part of Pitt's medical center.

According to Janice Markowitz, a member of The
Committee to Save the Syria Mosque and a former student
and employee of Pitt, the National Development
Corporation has been a front for the university, which
wanted to disguise itself as the buyer of the mosque
because of potential public disapproval when plans for

" its destruction were disclosed.

Markowitz said the interests of the students and the
community were disregarded by Presby’s plans to erect

‘M.

an office building.

“Pitt has been able to be a r_1on—proﬁt [organization]
when it comes to paying taxes but a profit [organization]
when purchasing buildings and making money,” she
said. ’

“It_doesn’t make economic sense,” said Richard Dillon,
a member of The Committee to Save the Syria Mosque.
Dillon said the action was very shortsighted.

“The new building will not generate tax revenues,
employment opportunities  or [beneﬁt] student needs,”
he said. _ if -

National Development Corporation ofﬁcials could not
be reached for comment.

The demolition crew apparently ended plans for a
street fair scheduled for next Tuesday night outside the
mosque. But a spokesperson for the Committee T 0 Save
The Mosque said the organization remains undaunted by
the destruction of the building.

“We’re going to have our rally, and we’re going to
continue to have this site designated historic  We ask
students to contact President U. Dennis] O’Connor and let
him know how they feel about this issue. It's very
important that [he addresses] the issue and for the mayor
of this city to address the issue.”

As bulldozers emptied buckets of debris on theilot '

beside the mosque, Pitt Professor and member of the

Save The Mosque committee Roy Lubove said, “Why for
the benefit of all the university couldn't it be converted
into a multi—cultural center — housing, theater, art
exhibits, performing arts, music, conferences? That would
have been a creative use for the building. Compare that
to a collection of offices.''. '

According to Keyes, the mosque site has recently
become a part of the Schenley Farms Historic District,
which stretches north into the residential area beyond
Bigelow Boulevard. Any building erected on the mosque
grounds must first come under the consideration of the
Historical Review Commission before being approved by
City Council. C. A

Anne Weis, professor of fine arts and .classics at Pitt,
said the campaign to save the Mosque should go beyond
the preservation of a single building.

According to Weis, the short-sighted planning " of
developers is ruining the cultural fate of Oakland and the
city. , .
“[The mosque has been a cultural center for Pittsburgh
since it was first established, Oakland especially,” Lubove
said. “Oakland is ﬁlled with office buildings  the junk
environment keeps growing.” ‘

The acquisition of the Syria Mosque by Pitt would
enable the university to host a variety of cultural events
for large audiences, he said. '

Staff leader Works to improve relations with administration  

By Catherine Goldstein
Staﬂ" Writer

At age 29, with a husband, two
children and a career, Joanne
Rosol, president of the Staff
Association Council, went back
to school.

“I am pursuing my degree in
public administration, and my
goal is to graduate by the time
my kids‘ graduate from high
school and college. Right now
my priorities are my children; my
daughter uses the dependent
scholarship, and I want to offer
the same opportunity to my son
so he can finish his education
here at Pitt. It is such a fine
institution, and a lot is offered
that unfortunately not everyone
takes advantage of,” Rosol said.

Rosol said when she graduated
from high school, careers like
secretarial work and getting a
Mrs. degree were encouraged,
but higher education wasn’t.

Rosol started working for Pitt
on a part-time basis in the College

of General Studies. Although she
wasn’t sure if she wanted to work,
it turned out to be everything she
had wanted.

“I love dealing with people,
the ﬂexibility of everything and
the teamwork atmosphere,” Rosol
said. .

As the assistant to the director
of recruiting and orientation in
CGS, she works with businesses,
like Bell Telephone, and health-
care organizations. She tells
employees about the
opportunities for non—traditional
students who want to complete
their college degrees. 4 '

Rosol has just completed her

‘third year as president of SAC

and is now beginning her fourth.
In 1983 she nominated herself to
be a member of. SAC, and from
there slowly climbed the
proverbial SAC'ladder.

“As president you ultimately
represent the staff and look out
for their welfare, as well as
working with other staff officers
to try and change things. For

example, in 1989 the first annual
staff—recognition program was

implemented to recognize the 1.:
services of long-term employees. ‘ "V

Recently we co—sponsored the
Wellness health fair in March °...
The reason I came to SAC in the
first place was to improve the
communication between
administration and the staff,"
Rosol said. --

In 1989 the SAC bylaws were
approved by the administration.

. SAC is now recognized as an

official university organization.

“It’s not to say we weren’t
recognized before, but now we
work with the administration, and
more gets- accomplished. .It’s-
important to work with people
rather than against them because
it makes getting things done a
little smoother and easier,” Rosol
said.

SAC members have been active
as officers and staff members for
various university committees.
Last year they helped to plan the

student. We want our students to
accomplish the goals they set out
to do. It gets very easy for
someone with a family, a full-
time job or both to become
frustrated and drop out of college.

We do everything we can to

support our students and keep

them in school.”
Comfort said Saturday classes

are available; Off—campus courses’ . i in

are available at South ‘Hills, Penn
Hills and Downtown locations.

CGS also provides a prison
program, which allows inmates
at Western Penitentiary to
participate in courses through
the external-studies program. And
the College for the Over Sixty
offers senior citizens the
opportunity to audit classes for
$10 a course.

CGS is one of Pitt’s best—kept
secrets, Rosol said.

“People are aware that [CGS]
exists, but not everyone realizes
how much we have to offer in
terms of
opportunities," Rosol said. “It’s
nice to hear people say, ‘I never

. knew about this program. I’m

5.

really glad I ‘learned about it
now.”’

Through its -administrative
offices located on the_fourth floor
of the Cathedral of Learning, CGS
handles its own admissions,
registrations and academic
advising with a staff of about 65.

The faculty for CGS classes are
assigned by the university’s
academic departments and
professional schools. “We’re our
own college within the university
system,” Comfort said.

CGS offers both bachelor’s of
science and bache1or’s of arts
degrees in 25 majors, provides
between 450 and 500 courses per
term and awards approximately

600 undergraduate degrees per *

year, Comfort said.

You have the Oakland blues even
before classes begin? It’s the same old
scene every year. For the next four months,
every sight, stench and nightly noise will
scar your brain and take a terrible toll on
your already weak constitution.

Winter break will only be a brief release
from the gridlock. Then all of a sudden,
it’s another semester. Take my advice —
get out. ‘

It’s just a 25-minute walk to Squirrel
Hill. Yes, Squirrel Hill, the wonderful
Pittsburgh community where the spirits
are free and the bus fare is $1.25.

Following Forbes Avenue beyond
Carnegie Mellon, Squirrel Hill’s boundaries
are approximately in the 15217 zip code.
(Of course, no official area is designated,
as with all small neighborhoods in
Pittsburgh.)

Squirrel Hill is abbreviated in different
ways. Most common is SQ Hill, but “Girl”
Hill is a popular gay—community
colloquialism for the large gay community
living in the area.

Squirrel Hi1l’s heart is the intersection
of Forbes and Murray avenues. Forbes

J Local neighborhoods enliven Pitt experience

Ups and downs of N. Oakland

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News

The sights, the sounds and ahhh  the
smells of North Oakland.

There’s nothing quite like being on a
city street on a hot, muggy day and
walking past the blower fan on the wall of
a restaurant. (Actually, there is a similar
experience: passing through a thick black
cloud of bus exhaust.)

The almost astounding number of both
restaurants and buses in North Oakland
weren’t necessarily an advantage to those
of us living there this summer.

North Oakland ‘has got its ups and
downs but appears to fall in the middle of
the road when compared to neighboring
South Oakland and Shadyside.

One of the pluses (or, minuses,

depending on your perspective) of life in _

North Oakland is the variety of places to
go and things to do.

“It’s cool being close to the Carnegie,”
former Pitt student Joe Rieker said. “I like
to go there once every few months.” He
also enjoys bicycling on the Schenley Park
trails. ,

Pitt student Steve Boberski likes North
Oakland because “it’s a lot safer than
South Oakland to be sure, and the people
who live in North Oakland are a lot
quieter, less boisterors, less troublesome,”
he said.

“I feel safer. People are more friendly,"
he said.

Boberski finds North Oakland a little ‘

less stressful than both South Oakland
and Shadyside. J

“Shadyside is nice, but North Oakland
is a lot more fun," he said. “In Shadyside
it's like I’m afraid to go out the door
because I might get sued — by a lawyer
no less."

And for things to do, apart from the bars,
there’s Graffiti, which “isn’t the Metropol,
but then it isn’t the Decade, either,”
Boberski said.

“The party scene is really cool,” Carlini
said.

Plus, North Oakland is crawling with
trendy little shops full of interesting things
to look at, if not buy.

“I don’t go into any of them, but they
don’t bother me,” Rieker said.

Most students ﬁnd the wares for sale at
the South Craig Street shops a little
impractical and outrageously expensive.
There is a reasonable video store, though.

Speaking’ of South Craig Street, North
Oakland is the home of the gay—cruising
issue. The student residents I’ve talked to
generally don’t have a problem with
cruising. . i

The attitude seems to be: Since the
average apartment party is 100 times more
disruptive than the gays who are cruising
that night, and since we throw and go to
apartment parties, who cares?

Long—term, non-student residents make
the most noise on this issue, so once in
awhile South Craig Street becomes a circus
with the media and the police in the center
ring.

“Until the crime spree that started when
my bike was stolen, this place was great,”
said Rieker. “I used to leave my car

“Doing SAC the last three years
I've had to put my education on

grueling, and sometimes I’ll be
working until 8, 9 or 10 o’clock.
,It’s enjoyable but very demanding.

things are behind us, and if we
constantly bring them up we
won’t be able to move ahead. We
need to learn from our mistakes

On Aug. 5, Rosol and other
SAC officers met with Pitt
President J. Dennis O'Connor for
an hour and a half and discussed
communication between the
administration and the staff. ,

“We didn't want to overwhelm

was basically to open dialogue

decisions were made, but we will

Rieker had left his Canondale
bicycle on his front porch while
he ran into the house to make a
phone call.

“ BadMoveMagazmecal1ed me
a week later,” said Rieker, who
was working as a bike messenger
at the time.

‘Rieker said another tenant in
his building had his bike stolen
the same week.

In spite of all this, Rieker thinks
“this is the best place to live in
Oakland. South Oakland is like a
slum, and the crime is really bad
there,” he said.- “There’s trash up
to your knees, broken glass
everywhere, noise.”

Rieker likes North Oakland’s
accessibility to laundromats and
grocery stores and going to the
bars that offer specials.

and the Squirrel Cage.”

A famous spot for many
students, The Squirrel Hill
Cafe (known by all as the
“Cage”) is a night spot for
Slater.

Slater commented on the
aesthetics_ of the
neighborhood: “The streets
have trees. I like the row
houses. lt’s friendly. The
people are easygoing.” He
is looking for an apartment
in SQ Hill. “I also think
[Squirrel Hill] has a good
name.”

That name has been
around since the 1760s. It
was a wooded area with —
you guessed it — an
abundance of gray
squirrels. No one in
particular penned the
name.

On her way downtown,
Laura Nathan said, “I love
Squirrel Hill. It’s a great
hometown. My kids can
still -play here.” She
described her former
residence, Los Angeles, as
the antithesis of this
neighborhood.

“When you walk down
the streets here, people say,
‘Hi’  You’ could not just

' walk up to people on the
street and ask these
questions [in Los Angeles], ”
Nathan said, referring to
this reporter's impromptu
interview.

An all-night‘ so Hill hot
spot is the corner of
Darlingtonf Road and
Murray,Avenue, according
to Jamie Samson, a high-
school student.

Local teen agers “hang”
in the area, Samson said.
These “juvenile
delinquents" play hacky
sack and participate in
underage smoking. What
more fun could you want
to have? .

on South Craig, cheesesteaks at
G’s, subs at Subway, pizza at
Pizza Outlet, Italian food at More’s
and even Scottish food at Great
Scot (although, personally, I don’t
find myself craving chutney all
that often).

“G’s is the restaurant in North
Oakland to go for,” said student
Steve Boberski, who recently
moved to Shadyside and said he
misses North Oakland. “G’s has
good greasy college food, huge
sandwiches pretty cheap, and its
the only place that’s open til 4
a.m.” *

(The White Tower is also open
at 4 a.m. While I was passing by
it one day, a friend remarked,
“Remember all the times we didn’t
go there?”)

Or you can always go to the
Gulf store and get Doritos and a
candy bar. The 24-hour Gulf store
is definitely an advantage,
particularly to smokers.

The bars in North Oakland are
geared more toward students than
those in South Oakland and
Shadyside, with drink specials
for every day of the week during

the regular school year.

Mitchell’s and Thirsty’s aren’t
dives to the same extent as the
SOD, nor do they mix their drinks
with Perrier.

In a North Oakland bar, your
feet will stick to the floor, but at
the same time, you needn’t fear
leaving one of your shoes behind.

Chiefs is the barﬂy’s bar. You

expect Henry Chinaski tosit down A

beside you.
“I used to cut high school and

A go to Chiefs for lunch,” student

Gene Carlini said. “Chiefs is cool.”

The atmosphere at Mitchell's
can be summed up in two words:
“classic tracks.” Don't forget your
tie~dye.

At Thirsty’s, there’s a DJ some
nights who tries (bless his heart)
to play something a little more
funky. Thirsty’s is either very
small or very popular or a
combination of both. It's always
loud and crowded.

I’ve never been to The Luna or
Panther Hollow Inn, but as I
understand it, they’re much like
the infamous SOD in South
Oakland.

 habits die hard ,
 President J. Dennis O’Connor arrived on campus this

g . summer, sportingthe new ‘blood of renewal. However,
if ‘it looks like_ some of the old attitudes of non-disclosure

remain clogged in Pitt’s arteries. .
When The Pitt News requested a specific list of the costs-

that made up the $82,000 price tag on redecoration of the

president’s office on the first floor of the Cathedral of

l;".’L‘earning, Pitt refused to release the information. This
1*-. does not sound like the new “open university” everyone
7 has been promised. ' . .

1.  After the controversy caused by Wesley Posvar’s $3.3

million “golden parachute” and Pitt’s attempt to keep the

_ figures from the taxpayers as well as’ the legislators, the

refusal to disclose all of the details of such a questionable

. expenditure only draws attention and suspicion to the
7 renovation.

The necessity of this pricy redecoration —at a time when

 the university is under great financial strain is rather

dubious. _
' Posvar’s office was lavishly furnished, and while it may
have needed a few minor changes, spending such a large

-amount was unfair to tuition-paying students. Students,

faculty and staff are not the only ones who have to make
sacriﬁces during hard ﬁscal times; university administrators

_ must also shoulder the burden. *

There is no doubt that some renovation was probably
necessary on the office. It islikely that there was some
maintenance needed after its previous tenant vacated the
office after occupying it for 24 years. '

But, like Pitt tells us time after time when it raises tuition, '

the bottom line is cost. And no matter how big the Pitt
budget is,.as long as tuition continues to rise and faculty
salaries remain below the American Association of
Universities average, an $82,000 renovation to any one

I person’s office is a slap in our collective face.

_For instance, $82,000 is enough money to hire a high-
quality professor, which is a desperate necessity at a
university where classes are notoriously overcrowded.

— $82,000 could also help improve facilities or allow
3 additional late-night study areas.

O’Connor has said, “I tend to think in terms of a leaner

. administration in which perhaps more is asked of each

individual, but in turn I think the positions may be a little
bit more rewarding because they are a‘ little bit more
diverse.”

If the reward O’Connor refers to is the opportunity by

I administrators to see young minds grow and achieve, the

university community can expect a dramatic turnaround
in the way situations are handled by its policy-makers.

, But if the rewards consist of renovations such as the one
O’Connor’s office is receiving, the university community

. will once again have to suffer‘ at the hands of the

administration.

China syndrome, the sequel

Where is a good conservative
when you need one? I grew up
thinking that conservatives stood
for two things: making money
and anti-communism. I always
assumed the one conservative
principle that could not be bought
was the rabid hatred of anything
that even had the appearance of
Marxism-Leninism, communism,
socialism or just plain sharing.
Therefore President Bush’s stand
on relations with China has been
a bit confusing.

In caseyou have not heard,
China’s “most favored nation”
status has been approved by
President Bush. Most favored
nation status provides, among’
other things, special low tariffs
for a country’s products to enter
the ‘American market. China’s
economy is in shambles, and
China is desperate for any way to
trade products and raise capital.’
Continued most favored nation
status is crucial to the Chinese
economy. I

There are two basic problems
with giving most favored nation
status to China. First, China is the
last major hard-line Marxist power

in the world. Second, China’s I

ungracefully aging rulers have
been behaving very badly.

Most-favored—nation status is a
reward for a country that attempts
to act democratically and with a
modicum of restraint. It is true
that in the last 10 to 15 years
China has been opening ‘up its
economy.

Unfortunately, the old men in
power havenot loosened their
grip on the throats of the Chinese
people. On June 4, 1989, China,
in virtual contempt of
international opinion, brutally
murdered hundreds of students
demonstrating in Tiananmen
Square.

    

Mark’. ~
Carlin

Since then the government has
arrested everyone it could find
who was involved with" the
demonstrations and executed
dozens of others for the crime of
having an opinion. Also, China
continues to brutalize the people
of Tibet in a ceaseless. attempt to
quell the Tibetan thirst for

freedom. Finally, this brutal,"

unrepentant government is one
of the world's heaviest arms
dealers, selling some the most
grotesque weapons of destruction

to anyone who will buy them, I

including many of our adversaries
(Iraq, Iran and Libya).
The hardest part to figure is that

‘ President Bush, a conservative
"elected on the heels of the most

avowed anti-Marxist president in
our history, has been the strongest
proponent of granting China most
favored nation status. How did
this happen?

Bush claims that a lot more can
be accomplished by encouraging
change as a friend than by trying
to force change as an enemy.

This sounds reasonable until
you realize that as it stands now,
there is absolutely no incentive
for China to change. It’s getting
everything it wants without having
to sacrifice anything. I doubt very
much that Bush’s gentle nudging
and an occasional request to the

Chinese leaders to be polite is
going to bring about change.

' Bush, who would only give

sanctions a few months to work
against Iraq, doesn't seem like

the type to really believe that .

gentle persuasion is going to
work with a recalcitrant nation.

The only answer I can see is
that China, presents a huge gold
mine to American business.

George Bush may be the most
pro-business president in this '

country’s history. Almost every

action by the president has been  -
justified by how it affects

business. Day care and maternity
leave were vetoed by the “family
president” because they would
cost business too much. The
man who "calls himself the
“environmental president” has
opposed virtually all
environmental legislation
because it is bad for businesses
who are in the habit of polluting
the environment or plundering
the resources of our wilderness
areas.

George Bush understands
profit, and with over a billion

Chinese citizens, he sees the,

potential for plenty of it in China.
The investment possibilities in
China could be unimaginable,
and Bush does not want to
jeopardize that opportunity over
something as silly as a principled
humanitarian stand-

So what does this say about
conservatives? Maybe they really
don’t have any principles beyond
profit. Maybe the only reason
they hated communism was that
it was a system that _didn’t allow
them a chance to make a buck.
Maybe not, but President Bush’s
actions seem to look that way.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, August 28, 1991

    

 

 

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬁ’ Writer

Six seniors will lead Lady
Panther volleyball into the 1991
season with high expectations.
The Lady Panthers, ranked 17th
by Volleyball Monthly, begin with

l a match Friday against Penn State

at Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt was 32-6 last season. They
did not lose a match in the Big
East on the way to the conference
title in both regular season and
tournament play.

They advanced past the first
round of the NCAA tournament
for the first time in team history by
beating Ohio State before losing
to Nebraska in the second round.
The one downside was the team's
0-4 record against Top 10
competition, winning only two
games overall, as they lost to UCLA
and Nebraska once and Penn State
twice.

“Last year was a big stepin the
development of our program,”
said head coach Sue Woodstra.
“We need to have another season
like 1990 and take our team to the
next level of play nationally. By
the next level, I mean the Top 10
nationally.” _ _

The Lady Panthers have
undergone some changes. Co-
captains Michele Adamson and
Big East Player of the Year Jenelle
Lantagne have graduated.
Lantagne is now a graduate
assistant.

“I’m glad it has worked out,”
said Lantagne of coaching. “It
would be hard not being involved

’ 1990 Big East Player of the Year Jenelle

placing lot

at all since it has been such a big
part of my life. I think it will be
hardest when they start playing
in the games. Then I'll be really
itching to get out there." V

Pitt has also added Cindy
Braziel to its staff, replacing Sue
Hoover as assistant coach. Braziel
previously ‘was an assistant at
Texas A&M for two years and at
Wyoming for four years.

Four first-year players will join
the team this season. Annemarie
Mernagh, a S—foot, 8-inch native
of Portage, Mich., will take
Lantagne’s place at setter. Tracy
Komar of Cochranton, Pa., and
Melanie Gustafson of Long Lake,
Minn., are both 6-0 middle hitters,
and Chelsea Hemingway of Villa
Hills, Ky., is a 5-9 outside hitter.

“With a team that has six seniors
who will all be leaving after this
season, it is important for the four
freshmen to get quality playing
time under their belts,” Lantagne
said. ‘

That will be difficult with the
players Pitt returns, led by senior
Co-captains Dee MacAuley and
Sue Zonneville. Zonneville’s 355
kills were tops on the squad last
year and picked up the slack when
injuries struck key players;
including MacAuley, who missed
only one game last season but
was bothered most of the season
by a back injury. ’

The injuries were more severe
in the cases of senior outside hitter
BridgetGary, sophomore outside
hitter Ann Marie Lucanie and first-
year middle hitter Carrie
Thornton.

I

l .

Gary, who stands only 5-6 but
is an explosive jumper, missed 16
matches with a knee problem that
eventually required surgery.

Lucanie was very impressive
early on. She was named Big East
Player of the week for September
17-23 and was leading the team in
kills when she suffered an ankle
injury that caused her to. miss 13
matches. She returned late in the
year and was named Big East
Tournament MVP. V

Thornton played in six matches
before her season was ended by
reconstructive surgery on her right
knee, and she was red—shirted.

Seniors Linda Zols and Heather
Hollands will probably start along
with‘ Lucanie, MacAuley,
Zonneville and Mernaugh.

It was Hollands who stepped
into the starting lineup when
Lucanie was hurt last season. Gary
and another senior, Shelly Seanor,
will probably be the first two
players off the bench.

This group is very capable of at
least a repeat of last season’s
success. The question is: Can they
can go further? “We have so
much experience on this team,

‘ and experience is half the battle

in a lot of sports,” said Lantagne.

"Ithink these guys could pull it
together and get into the Top 10
and beat some teams in the Top
10. It is going to be tough, but I
don't think it is as far out of reach
as it has been in the past. It is a
realistic goal: to maintain the Top
20 all year definitely and start
inching it up a little bit higher.”

Annemarie Mernagh has a
tough job ahead. _

The first-year setter must
replace three-year starter and 1990
Big East Player of the Year Jenelle
Lantagne as the offensive catalyst
of Pitt’s T op-20 volleyball_team, a
team that also returns six seniors.

“Annie will be thrown into the
fire the very first day of practice,”
said head coach Sue Woodstra.
“She has very good technique,
soft hands and is familiar with the
set speeds in our offense, Woostra
said. ,

Mernagh lettered three times at
Portage Northern High School in
Portage, Michigan and made the
All-Conference, All—Region and
All—State teams as a senior.

“She fits in with the team really
well,” said senior co—captain Dee
MacAuley. “She has learned our
system pretty quick. It’s just a
matter of getting her on the court
and getting her some experience."

Lantagne, now a graduate
assistant coach with the team, has
worked quite a bit with Mernagh
and the other three first-year team
members: middle hitter Melanie
Gustafson, outside hitter Chelsea
Hemingway and Tracy Komar,

who plays both inside and outside. I

“L think she's doing really well

ntozgne tall orderfor neu/ComerMe1?nagl9 

so far,". said Lantagne, adding,”It’s

really hard to come in as a 

freshman at any position and play,
especially at the setter position,
because you have to work with

different kinds of hitters, and the « 
offense can be really different ,‘
from what you’ve _done in the- '

past. So far I'm really impressed

with her skills as an incoming‘

freshman and her consistency in

her setting. She has adapted’

quickly ...mainly to our quick sets
to the middle. I think maybe on-’

her [high school] team she ran it C

a little slower, and when you come
to a different level everything is a
little quicker, but she's re-ally
caught on.” - ' .
Mernagh was a bit reluctant to
judge how she is doing so far.
“I’m getting more comfortable,
but I guess I’ll just have to wait
until the first game and see how
I’m doing. Right now I have
nothing to compare it to , since I
haven’t played at the collegiate
level.” 4
In comparing the system at Pitt
to what she did in high school,
Mernagh said it wasn’t really more
complicated, just that the hitters
were a lot bigger. She also cited
having Lantagne around and
helping her as a big part of her
adjustment to this level.’ '
One complication is the added

Baseball races tight as September approaches

Baseball’s best race was
supposed to be the American
League West, but the Minnesota
Twins have the biggest advantage

of any division leader. The Pirates, ~

Dodgers and Blue Jays have
allowed the rest of the pack to
chip away at comfortable leads,
while the other contenders in the
AL West have come apart.

First to go was California. Then
a lack of pitching finally caught
up to the Rangers, as the
acquisition of Dennis “Oil Can"
Boyd was no help.’ Lack of
experience and consistency has
led to the demise of the Mariners.

ATT1~:NT1o1§f'  
PITT STUDENTS  

Domino’s Pizza
is happy to

Chicago and Oakland still have a
chance, but the White Sox are
struggling now, and the Athletics
haven’t gotten it together all year.

Minnesota, however, is the
division leader that is most likely
to fall apart. Scott Erickson has
been terrible in the second half,

and the starting pitching was thin‘

in the beginning. If Erickson
straightens himself out, the race
is over.

That is what has been said
quite a few times of the race in
the National League East.
Pittsburgh has been on the verge
of running away with it for a long

Ryan
Buncher

time, but the Cardinals just keep
hanging on. Pedro Guerrero’s
return has given the offense a
much-needed boost, and the

V pitching staff is solid. Most of all

this team is proof of what a
dominant closer like Lee Smith

can do for a team. If the Bucs had

a quality closer, that race would
be over, too.

The Pirates have struggled
recently, and they have a west-
coast trip coming up. On the good
side they have Barry Bonds
possibly headed for another MVP
award, and Bobby Bonilla is
making a late charge to join his
challengers. Doug Drabek seems
to have reestablished himself as
the ace in the, rotation with four
wins in his last five appearances,
and John Smiley just keeps
winning. Those four must continue
to do what they are doing now to
avert what would be a very
memorable collapse.

The Bucs will probably hold

 
  

on, and it seems like itwill be the
Braves, not the Dodgers, that they
will run into inxthe playoffs. Yes,
Darryl Strawberry is coming on,
but the Braves just got David
Justice back to even things out.

Both teams have solid starting 

rotations and weak bull pens. The
Braves have more offensive
weapons and are playing better.

The situation is about the same
in the AL East, where the Blue
Jays seem to be coming apart
again. The Tigers score a lot of
runs and play solid defense, but
they have no business winning
the division. If the Jays don't win
a division as weak as the East
with that much talent, not only
should Manager Cito Gaston be
fired, he should be banned from
ever managing again in the major
leagues.

The Tigers just keep winning
and will probably take the
division and face the Twins in a

rematch of the 1987 playoff,’ ..
which also followed a Blue Jay ‘ "

collapse. The Pirates seem
headed for a matchup with the
Braves in the National League
playoffs. A Pittsburgh—Minnesota
confrontation just like the Stanley
Cup is a very real possibility,
which would end up with similar
results and another champ-
ionship for Pittsburgh. The
tougher challenge facing the Bucs
will be the Braves, who are 9-3

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, August 28,1991

By Michael Milliron
Staff Writer

The Buffalo Bills ceased their
pointless bickering in 1990 and
finally began to take their
frustrations out on opponents.
The results were impressive as
the Bills won the AFC East with a
13-3 record, put on a 51-3 football
clinic against the L.A. Raiders in
the AFC’Championship and were
a missed ﬁeld goal away from
winning the big one.

It is now 1991, and the Bills are
virtually everyone’s favorite to
take it all this year. Quarterback
Jim Kelly leads an offense which
can be devastating regardless of

9 strategy. Kelly can strike with big

(V.

plays out of the pro—set, no-
huddle and four—receiver
formations.

Buffalo has superior offensive
weapons in running back
Thurman Thomas, the best
rushing/receiving threat in
football. Wide receiver Andre
Reed is perhaps the best receiver
in the NFL on short— and medium-
pass routes. The offensive line
has become a strength over the
past few years, led by Pro Bowl
center Kent Hull. There are some
question marks defensively,-
however. Starting ends Bruce
Smith and Leon Seals are banged
up and may miss some time early
in the season. Safeties Leonard
Smith and Mark Kelso are not the
best cover guys in the world,
which makes No. 1 pick safety
Henry Jones’ holdout a poignant

issue in Buffalo. Still, the Bills,

will be solid defensively with the
return of Smith, linebackers Shane
Conlan and Cornelius Bennett
and cornerback Nate Odomes.
(12-4 and another division
crown.) ‘
Dangerous Dan Marino is still
the main man for the Miami
Dolphins. The Dolphins have
really catered to Marino lately,
making him the highest—paid

‘ player inthe NFL with a $25-

million contract. Miarni’s last three
drafts have imparted a bevy of
offensive talent to keep Marino
performing at a lofty level.
Running back Sammie Smith
,was taken in 1989 to give the
Dolphins a running threat. Last
year, tackle Richmond Webb (an
All-Pro for years to come) and
' guard Keith Sims started as
rookies on the left side of the" 0-
line, giving Marino good blind-
side protection. This year, receiver
Randal “Thrill” Hill was taken in
the first round to give Marino a

deep threat, as the Marks Brothers ,

(Duper and Clayton) have slowed
down. Third-rounder Aaron
Craver will start the season for an
injured Smith and be their third-
down back. ‘

With recent drafts emphasizing
offense, the defense has suffered
and is long in the tooth. Still,
defensive coordinator Tom
Olivadotti gets the most he can
from players past their prime like
Hugh Green, E.J. Junior and Cliff
Odom. The traded Tim McKyer
will be missed in coverage, as
former Bear Vestee Jackson will
try to hold down the left corner
spot.

Don Shula coaches this team,

MK‘.

so anything is possible, but the
Dolphins just do not have the
horses to run with Buffalo. They
have the look of a wild-cardteam,
although if Marino is under center,
anything can happen in the
playoffs. Ask the Kansas City
Chiefs. (10-6 and a wild-card
team.) 

Eric Dickerson finally attended

a whole training camp with the"

Indianapolis Colts. At this time
last year Dickerson was not with
the team, as he was bitter about
his contract. They were also taking
a lot of criticism for giving up so

much for Jeff George. George did
well as a rookie quarterback, and
Colt fans hope he has a Dan
Marino—type sophomore season.

George and Dickerson give
Indianapolis great big-play
potential.

The biggest problem with this
team is its offensive line.
Dickerson has been right in most
of his critiques of this unit. A
nightmarish situation exists at left
tackle, but they hope just—signed
Bubba Paris can play. Even
George and Dickerson cannot
perform without blocking.

Receiver Jyzssie Hester was a
pleasant ‘surprise last year and
looks to be the Colt deep threat.
Billy Brooks is an underrated
receiver. _

Defensively the Colts are
steady, not spectacular. They
could really use a big-play guy.
Hopes are that second-round pick
defensive end Shane Curry can
be that player. Don’t hold your
breath. Linebackers Duane
Bickettyand Chip Banks are not
the performers they once were.
Jon Hand must revert to his 1989
form when he was one of the

Buffalo, Miami tops in AFC East Division

better ends in the game. The
secondary is sound, but corners
Eugene Daniel and Alan Grant
lack ideal speed. (9-7 with an
outside shot at a wild card.)
General Manager Dick

Steinberg and head coach Bruce
Coslet have the New York Jets
headed in the right direction, and

1 they will get where they want to
go, but not this year. Steinberg
has had some good drafts and
has added plan-B players that
may start and make an impact,
like defensive linemen Bill Pickel

ever had is gone now that he is
too worried about fumbling.
Carlton Haselrig’s competition
at right guard was eliminated with
Terry Long’s problems, but it
would not have mattered. He has
matured into a solid starter.
Tom Ricketts and Justin
Strezelczyk, on the other hand,
haven’t matured, so Brian
Blankenship will return at left
guard and Tunch Ilkin is at right
tackle. '
The depth has become a serious
question, with only eight linemen

’ making the ﬁnal roster and one of

them being Long, who faces a
four-game suspension if his
appeal fails.

The development of rookie
receivers Jeff Graham and Ernie
Mills has been stifled by holdouts
and injuries. Graham’s holdout
lasted far longer than it should
have. His agent said the deal
would be done a few hours after
the Steelers dropped their
demand for an option year.

That was the first day of camp.
The Steelers dropped the option
year, and the deal was done, but
that was three weeks later. Both
players should help, but it will
take a while.

Two rookies on offense who
have emerged are tight end Adrian

  T ailback, depth, injuries concerns for Steelers  

Cooper and running back Leroy
Thompson. Cooper has proven
to be a good receiver as well as an
excellent blocker, but he is stuck
behind Eric Green and Mike
Mularkey. Thompson has
emerged as a quality third—down
receiver.

And remove all doubt, it will be
Bubby Brister throwing the
passes. Neil O’Donnel1 did have a
strong preseason and will
eventually challenge for the
starting job, but not yet.

The defense should be at least

i as good as last year, now that All-

Pro cornerback Rod Woodson is
in camp, and linebacker David
Little is on the verge of joining
him. Both should step right in
despite the time they missed.

Outside linebacker Greg Lloyd
was having a great preseason
before getting hurt and should
return soon. Jerrol Williams has
been outstanding filling in. Top
pick Huey Richardson has
struggled with a move to inside
linebacker and a broken hand,
but he should at least help as a
pass rusher.

Aaron Jones still hasn’t ..

established himself as a starter at
defensive end, but Kenny
Davidson and Keith Willis had
strong preseasons.

The secondary is thin, with Gary
Jones, Delton Hall and Sammy
Walker injured, but the starters
may be even better this year due

See Steelers, page 24

AFC

Continued from page 21
andJohn Bosa, offensive lineman
Irv Eatrnan and tight end Mark
Boyer.

The defense is starting to come
together. Tony Stargell andJames
Husty are a fine pair of young,
athletic corners who can cover
and play the run. The linebacking
needs to be upgraded and is led
by overachiever Kyle Clifton. Jeff
Lageman and Dennis Byrd are
aggressive line defenders with
good pass rushing potential.

Blair Thomas will get the ball
much more this season and get a
shot at the AFC rushing title.
Wideouts Al Toon and Rob Moore
give the Jets two big targets who
are capable of taking the short
pass a long way. Controversy
could exist at quarterback, where
it looks like veteran Ken O’Brian
will start with second—year man
Troy Taylor hot on his heels. . If
the Jets get better play out of the
offensive tackle and quarterback
positions, the offense could really

‘take off. (7-9, showing ﬂashes at
times.)

Not even Barry Manilow would 4

want to spend a weekend
watching the New England

Patriots. This team is bad, bad, ‘

bad. This team needs to go back
to fundamental football. They
don’t block very well, and they
make up for it by not tackling. As
for the Patriots’ execution, most
people are for it. A new regime
has been brought in with General-
Manager Sam Jankovich and
Coach Dick‘ Macpherson. Good
things come to those who wait,
and it looks like Patriot fans will
have to wait a long time. ‘

The Partiots will win in the
future with players like running
back Leonard Russell, tackle Pat
Harlow, linebacker, Chris
Singleton, cornerback Jerome
Henderson and defensive end Ray
Agnew. They must find a
competent signa1—caller among
Hugh Millen, Tommy Hodson and
rookie Scott Zolak (2—14.)

N91 Backyard Brawl,

Kickoff Classic top
Week’s grid action

By Rob Pugliese and

.g9»Brian Berger

T be Pitt News

Football season is here at last,
and the College Football
Association gives us not one but
two kickoff classics along with
the 84th edition of “the Backyard
Brawl.” Bust out the ducats; let’s
get into the spreads:

-At East Rutherford, Newjersey —
Kickoff Classic — Penn State (-2 1/
A 2) vs. Georgia Tech.

This game features two of the
finest squads in the nation and
should prove to be a hard-hitting,

. defensive struggle. If you like the
sound of helmets cracking and
pads popping, get ready for a
classic. The Nittany Lions come in

Etnked eighth in the nation (CNN

‘coaches’ poll) and boast possibly
the finest linebacking corps in the
land , featuring Mark‘ D’Onofrio
and Keith Goganious, not to
mention seasoned warhorses
Leonard Humphries and Darren
Perry in the secondary. This
defense is rock solid , with nine
returning starters and endless
depth at every spot. Their statistics
from a year ago are downright
scary, ranking them in the top 10

Much—maligned quarterback
Tony Sacca doesn’t have T om Bill
to worry about, but then again he
has no proven backs and only one
starter returning on a completely
rebuilt line. Look for junior Richie
Anderson to emerge as a star and
lend stability to the tailback spot.
State does have Blockbuster Bowl
star Terry Smith and OJ. McDufﬁe
at wideout, and this tandem will
give nightmares to any secondary.

Swilling... swilling... drilling.
Strong safety Ken Swilling, that is.
The man that hits harder than
T errninator X on the turntables
leads a nasty Yellow Jacket
defense that also features outside
linebacker Marco Coleman (13

sacks) and cornerback William

Clay. In all, eight starters return
from the unit that ranked 14th
nationally a year ago.

Field general Shawn Jones is
the straw that stirs the drink in
Tech’s offense. As a matter of fact
Jones generated 2,285 total yards
in directing Tech to an impressive
30.4 points per game and a share
of the national championshi p. Like

State,‘ this team has no proven'

backs and an inexperienced line,
so Jones will rely on his big-play
targets, split end Emmett Merchant

tailback Amp Lee (825 yards, 16
touchdowns) and bruising
fullback Edgar Bennett are the
nation’s finest backfield tandem.

; Throw in talented sophomore

Sean Jackson (427 yards, 7.9 per
carry), and you ’ve got the deepest
group around. Unheralded

quarterback Casey Weldon is
unbeaten as a starter while
completing 62 percent of his
passes and throwing for 1 2 TDs in
six games. He’ll throw to his
versatile backs often. The solid
line remains intact, and Shannon
Baker returns at wideout. This
offense averaged 39.5 points per
game a year ago, but the pride is
in the defense.

Nine starters return from a unit

that boasts three All-Americans.
This defense is simply awesome -
too awesome to even put into
perspective. All-American
cornerback Terrell Buckley talks
a big game and plays even bigger.
He had six interceptions a year
ago, including two for
touchdowns, and he is also one of
the top return specialists in the
land. The inside-linebacking duo

of All—Americans MarvinJones and
Kirk Carruthers left ball carriers
battered and bruised. Jones
registered a team-leading 133
tackles as a true ﬁrst-year player,
while Carruthers was a finalist for
the Butkus Award, given to the ,
nation’s best linebacker.

throw a lot. Only four starters
return on offense including one

on the line, which means Ty might
die against the attacking Seminole

D. On defense, the Cougars return
only five starters , and everyone
else is a ﬁrst-year player, albeit a
fine class. BYU isn’t bad; they
have a solid linebacking corps,

but they aren't nasty like Florida
State. They’ll win the weak WAC
conference and play Indiana in
the Holiday Bowl.

Lightning won't strike twice for
Bobby Bowden’s club. In ’88 the
Seminoles were ranked No.1 and
got bumrushed by Miami,’ 31-0.
State has a history of starting slow,
but this isn’t Miami. Good news
for BYU. Nine Mormons return
from_ their missions, and they’ll
need ‘em. Detmer will also need
someone to console him after the
Seminoles glaze him like a donut.
Take Florida State -14.
°At Morgantown, W.Va - “The
Backyard Brawl” — Pitt (+2 1/2) at
West Virginia. .

Two teams with substantial

’ talent and question marks aplenty.

We all know about Pitt. Gone
are eight projected starters, but
that might be a good thing. The
Panther defense could be primed
to finally have the dominating
season that has been expected.
In Keith Hamilton and Sean
Gilbert, Pitt potentially has the
nastiest pair of ends in the country.
Senior Ricardo McDonald is the
leading returning tackler and
should have a monster season.
The secondary is talented but
unproven. The key to this game
is to stop the run up the middle.
The Mountaineers racked up 378
yards on the ground in their 38-24
pasting of the Panthers a year
ago. A J

Alex Van Pelt looks to rebound
from a sub-par sophomore effort
that featured plenty of missed

 

receivers and key interceptions.

Jermaine Williams is the new hope
in the backfield, while there
doesn't seem to be much hope for
the wideouts. Pitt needs to pound
the run down the throats of the
weak WVU defensive line.

West Virginia’s offense is
running “straight outta Compton”,
as in six-foot seven-inch, 289 -
pound center Mike Compton. The
line also features the gargantuan
tackle , John Ray (6’10", 320lbs.).
But let’s get one thing straight
about the Mountie offense:
Quarterback Darren Studstill is
no Major Harris.

He will have his hands full in
this one if the Panthers stuff
tailbacks Adrian Murrell and
Garrett Ford. WVU has tons of
speed in wide receivers James
Jett and Michael Beasley. (Pitt fans
remember Beasley, who ran for
197 yards as a tailback in last
year’s game,) The problem is that
Studstill isn’t capable of getting

them the ‘ball.

The defense features seven
returning starters led by safety
Darrell Whitrnore and linebacker
Steye Grant, but only one of them
is a lineman. This spells big trouble
for Don Nehlen. Players are being
switched all over the line to
compensate for weaknesses ,’and
there won’t be much of a pass
rush to distract Van Pelt.

Forget last year. This one will
be different. The Panthers are 0-
2-1 in their last three meetings
with WVU, but an improved
defense should keep the
Mountaineer offense under wraps
and 63,500 screaming hoopies
very quiet. Another key point to
remember: West Virginia was a
dismal 0-7 versus the spread at

home last year. In a very tight I '

game that will be decided on

. mistakes; the Panthers will prevail.

Take Pitt +2 1/2.

a nice fill-in as backup safety until
Jones returns, while WLAF
refugee Richard Shelton will fill in
at the corner.

Andre Jones was drafted in the
seventh round, with the idea of
him replacing Tyrone Stowe as
special-teams maniac, but it is
12th—rounder Jeff Brady who
made the team at that spot.

In many ways the 1991 version
of the Steelers is much like the
1990 version. The defense will
have to carry the load early on
while the offense sorts itself out.
The offensive problems are not as
bad as last season, and this team
looks like it may get itself going
soon enough to make the playoffs.

They may not be able to beat
out the high-powered Oilers for
the division title, but a wild card
spot is definitely within reach,
and with such a good defense,
they could be a dangerous playoff
team.

Scramble for mythical national championship

By Rob Pugliese
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The college football season
kicks off tonight at 9:00 when
Penn State collides with Georgia
Tech and Joe Paterno begins his
quest for a third national title
before bolting for the Big Ten in
1993. Football fans have much to
be excited about in ’91.

The national championship
race should be wide open, with
as many as seven or eight teams
holding legitimate hopes for the
title. As always, scheduling will
be a decisive factor in determining
the champion. For example, Penn
State begins with the Ramblin’
Wreck and will also face Southern
Cal at the Coliseum, BYU, Miami
at the Orange Bowl, Notre Dame
and Pitt here at Pitt Stadium. The
Lions have so many roadblocks
that it will be very difficult to
remain unbeaten.

In contrast, Miami has only to
worry about the Nittany Lions,
Houston and a road game at
Tallahassee with Florida State.
Even worse, the Washington
Huskies of the weak PAC—1O
Conference play only two difficult
games the entire season. All of
this cries out the need for a play-
off system to determine the
champ. In a season where there
are this many elite teams, a Penn
State squad that ﬁnishes 10-2
could be as good as an 11-0
Washington team.

A At least there are some
explosive matchups to look
forward to. The biggest clash of
the titans could be September 28
when Bobby Bowden’s Florida
State Seminoles invade Ann Arbor
to take on Michigan. This game
will go a long way in determining
who’s smiling on January 1. ‘On
this very same day Shawn Jones
and Georgia Tech will visit the
Clemson Tigers and their nasty
defense, led by Butkus Award
candidate Levon Kirkland. On
October 12, the Southeastern
Conference’s two powerhouses,
Tennessee and Florida, will wage
war in Gainesville in what should
be a memorable "affair. Florida
State will close out the year by
playing Miami on November 16
and Florida on November 30, so
Bowden’s boys will deﬁnitely be
earning the title should they go
undefeated. ,
-Florida. State is loaded on
"defense and also has the finest
stable of backs anywhere. So all
of the pressure will fall on junior
signal-caller Casey Weldon. He is
a bit undersized and not ﬂashy by
any means, but he went 6-0 as a
starter last season and completed
62 percent of hismpasses.
-Michigan is well-stocked at
most positions. Elvis Grbac has
established himself at quarter-
back, and the offensive line will
be awesome as usual, led by six-
foot, eight—inch Greg Skrepenak.
With the early departure of
tailback Jon Vaughn to the NFL,
sophomore Ricky Powers will be
the main man in Ann Arbor.
0In Miami, it is up to junior
Gino Torretta to carry on the
brilliant tradition of quarterbacks.
He was recently named the starter
after a long duel with sophomore
Brian Fortay, and Coach Dennis

Erickson better hope he made the
right choice because Fortay has
now decided to transfer. T orretta
will feel the heat early and often if
he fails to produce. Last year was
the ﬁrst time since 1984 that Miami
lost two games in the regular
season, so the ‘Canes are burning
for revenge.

Look for Florida State to come
out smokin’ against BYU, survive
the trip to Michigan and handle
Miami easily. Their season as well
as Florida's will come down to the
November 30 battle. Despite the
brutal schedule, Penn State will
ﬁnish at 1 1-1, only tripping against
the ‘Canes at the Orange Bowl.
Notre Dame is very overrated,
and Rick Mirer isn’t even close to
the quarterback Irish fans think
he is. The Irish eyes will be crying
to the tune of an 8-3 season.
Washington could go undefeated,
but it doesn't matter; remember
their weak schedule. I’d like to
pick Florida to win it all just to be
different, but this will be the year
that Bobby Bowden and Florida
State finally win that elusive
national title.
