Students Pick Nixon,

Kennedyfor Election

Massachusetts Senator John Kennedy and Vice-President

Richard Nixon will oppose each other in the Presidential
election of 1960, according to students polled at the time of
Kennedy’s appearance here last month. ,

Of the 380 students asked “Who do you think will be the

Democratic candidate in the

next election?”, 40 per cent

thought Kennedy, an announced
candidate, would be that par.ty’s
choice;_32 ‘per cent picked Steven-
son, twice defeatedfor the Presi-
dency; 12 per cent selected Stuart
Symington, Senator from ,Missouri,
and two per cent Senator Hubert
Humphrey from‘ Minnesota.

Senator“ Lyndon Johnson of
Texas received six per cent of the
votes, with 27'per cent undecided.

Asked “Who is‘ your prefer-
ence for the .1960 Democratic‘
candidate?”, the’ majority’ still
chose Kennedy, who received a
vote of conﬁdence from 57 per
cent of those polled. Stevenson
was second with 30 per cent,
and Symington was preferred by
ﬁve students, Johnson by eight,
Humphrey by four and Averill
Harriman by two. Five per cent’
were undecided.

One vote each was given Estes
Kefauver, Robert Meyner, Chester
Bowles, William 0. Douglas, Lili
St. Cyr, Al Capone and Earl Long;

Eighty-one per cent of the
students asked thought Nixon
would be the Republican selec-
tion for 1960,’ though- only 43

per cent actually preferred him A

as a candidate. Fourteen per
cent considered Nelson Rocke-
_feller likely to be ‘chosen, and
ﬁve per cent remained unde-.

has recently withdrawn from
the Presidential candidate race.

i,_ inaugurate the 1960 campaign
with a dual meet at Springﬁeld,

Springﬁeld College ‘aggregation
 by Jeff Cardinalli and com-
' pany. H
The local gymnasts are coached
by Warren-Neiger who is starting
his sixth year as the Panthers’
--' tutor. Neiger, a graduate of Penn
State, is the man. most ‘responsible
for"making the Blue and Gold
gym team one of the nation’s top

 Hirststill retains the record for

(2551/5 points), held by Jim
Mulvihill. .

Kasner, who placed ﬁfth in the

9’ Over Weekend . 

I “A repeat performance of the
Maryland meet will not happen”
was the swimming team’s new
year’s res-olution. But making this
task a reality may be a pretty big
job for the Panther tankers. After
losing the season opener to the
Terrapins of Maryland, the Blue
and Gold tankers will be looking
for their ﬁrst win as they travel
to Lexington, Va., this Friday to
1'neet‘VMI, a newcomer on the
"Panthers schedule.

On Saturday the Panther Mer-
men will travel farther South to
‘T Raleigh, North Carolina, to swim
against what is reportedly a
strong North Carolina State team.
“We’re going to do our best‘
against both VMI and North
Carolina State, I just hope that
with the new year we receive a
change of , luck,” commented
coach Ben Grady. He also con-
cluded, “I don’t know really what

team they had beaten earlier. But
according to Coach Bob Timmons,

“The defeats were not due to a ‘ , ,
‘unsuccessful attempt to capture
their fourth consecutive AWilkes- I

lack of points but a lack of good
defensive play.” ' ‘

“‘It takes a good team to win
away from home,” added Tim-
mons. Tonightthe -hoopsters will
get a chance to prbve they can
win at home. Temple has a fast
breaking team and could give the
Cats a lot of trouble on their

home floor.

- Kennedy All-American ,
Bill (Pickles) Kennedy, an All-
American, will be Temple’s big
gun. Kennedy is ,a great ball-
handler and shooter, and along
with Russ Gordon will give Tem-
ple a one—two combination that
will be hard to beat. Lastyear, at
Philadelphia, Temple won 86-73.
Forward Dick Falenski 'will

be returning to action this even- ’

ing after recovering‘ from’ a

slightly sprained ankle suffered

in the Canisius game. Falenski,

who is averaging 154 points a

game, should ‘be in top form to-

night. " _ ‘

Tiinmons pointed out that Paul
Lazor and Mike Ditka_ have been
picking up the slack left by Fal-
enski and John Fridley, both of
whom have been playing far be-
low their potential. In the ﬁrst
nine games Fridley has averaged
10.3 points a game, almost two
pointslessthan hedid last year
as a sophomore.

Top Scorers ,
Other" top scorers for the Blue
and Gold have been Bill Mauro,
13.8, John Mills, 11.9, and Bob

Sankey, 9.8. On a point for point
basis the Panthers "have averaged-

71.3 points to their opponents’
74.4. Their record stands at 4-5,

with wins coming over Michigan,
St. John’s, Duquesne. and Boston

College.

When asked if the basketball
scandal has hurt the lzeam, Tim-
mons replied, “Looking at. the
entire team, it 'doesn’t seem to
have affected us. Of course a few
of the players may have had that
on their minds, but, as I said be-
fore, poor defensive play cost us
our last three defeats.”

Wrestlers I Get‘
First Test At '  
Maryland

By TED COLTON
With two of the best wres-
tlers in the country and an
otherwise inexperienced team,

Coach Rex Peery will open

the 1960 wrestling season with
Maryland, the Atlantic Con-

ference champs, on the Terrapins
home mat Saturday.
The Panthers are fresh. off an

Barre tourney championship. They

ﬁnished second, being nosed out‘

by New York AC, 44-39,. ,

The 123 and 130 pound classes I

will feature the Panthers’ Mighty
Mites, Dick Martin and Larry
Lauchle. Martin, 123 pound soph-
omore, won his weight division at

the Wilkes itourney-and looks like .

one of the best small men Peery

has come up with in a. long time. A

Lauchle, 130 pound, was 17-1
last year. His only loss came at
the hands of Dick Auble of" Cor-
nell in ‘the National finals.
Lauchle captured the Easterns’
130 pound’ class and also won
the Wilkes tourney. This year
he came in third in the Wilkes
tourney when he was beaten by
W. B. Glover of VPI in over-

s time. ' I
Sophomore

Daryl Kelvington

-.._<_zvill represent the Cats in the 137

pound class. Kelvington was last
year’s Wilkes champ, but was un-
able to wrestle this year because
of a bad knee. However he is
expected to be ready for Mary-
land Saturday. -
Fine Sophomore Prospect

John Zolikoff was runner up in
‘the 147 pound class at Wilkes and
looks like another ﬁne sophomore
prospect. Zolikoff, who has been
nicknamed the mad Russian, is a
strong arm boy who will improve
with experience.

After these weights the Pan-
thers will have Joe Schmitt and
August Arrigone at 157 and. 167
classes respectively. Both boys
are sophomores. At 177, Lenny
'Vuocolo will be back. Vuocolo
had a 1-11-1 record last year
but is expected to improve this
year. ‘ ,

In the heavyweight division

Tom Hall and Bob Guzik will"

provide the Panthers’ attack. A
new rule this year in the Eastern
schools has created a 191 pound
class. ‘Hall will wrestle at this
weight when the Panthers. are
wrestling Eastern
Guzik will wrestle heavyweight.

"LITTLE. STORIES VVITH BIG MORALS” I
, First Little_Story

Once upon a time a German exchange student from old Heidel-
berg came to an American university. He lived in the men’s
dormitory of the great American university. He was a ﬁne,
decent young man and all the other young men in the dormitory
of the great American university tried very hard to make
friends with him, but, unfortunately, he was soshy that he
refused all their invitations to join their bull sessions. After 9.

while his dormitorymates got tired of asking him and so the ~

poor German exchange student, alas, spent every evening alone
in his -room. « '

Onelnight while-sitting all alone in his room, he smelled the
most delicious aroma coming from the .room next. door. Con-
quering his shyness, he walked to the room next door and there
he saw a bunch of his dormitory mates sitting around and dis-
cussing literature, art, culture, and like that. They were all
smoking Marlboro cigarettes, which accounts for the delicious
aroma smelled by the German exchange student.

Timidly, he.entered the room. “Excuse me,” he said, “but
what is that marvelous smell I smell?”

“It’s ourgood Marlboro cigarettes,” cried the men, who were
named Fun-loving Ned, Happy Harry, Jolly Jim, and Tol’able
David.

So the German exchange student took a Marlboro and en-
joyed those better makin’s, that ﬁner ﬁlter, that smooth, hearty
ﬂavor, and soon he was comfortable and easy and lost his
shyness. ‘

From that night forward, whenever he smelled the good smell
of Marlboro cigarettes, he always went,next door and joined
the bull session.

MORAL: WHERE THERE’S SMOKE, THERE’S MEYER

Second Little Story.

Once upon a time there was an Indian brave named Walter T.
Muskrat who had a squaw named Margaret Giggling VVater.

_ Margaret was sort of a mess but she sure could make beaded

moccasins. Every day she whipped up a brand-new pair of
beaded moccasinsfor Walter, which were so gorgeous that all
the Indian maids on the reservation grew giddy with admiration.

Well, sir, Margaret got pretty tense about all the girls making
eyes at Walter and one night they had a terrible quarrel.
VVaIter ﬂew into a rage and slapped her on the wrist, whereupon
