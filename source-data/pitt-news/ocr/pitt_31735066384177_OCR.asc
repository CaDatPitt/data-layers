Senate Passes Tax Bill; House Action Next Step

By the Associated Press

() HARRlSBURG—-The Senate last night passed a bill

increasing personal and business income taxes,

breaking a two-month deadlock and bringing the state
closer to a completed budget.
The bill, to increase the 2 percent income tax to 2.1

percent, passed 26-23.

The tax bill passed with the minimum number of

votes needed.

The long—sought compromise fell into place earlier
yesterday when the Senate agreed to amendments sup-
ported by two senators who had held out against in-

creased taxes.

“We’d just as soon see no increase but we’re at the
point where we no longer can ignore the fact we have
to fund the educational institutions of this state,” said
Sen. Thomas Nolan, the amendment’s chief sponsor.

He said he felt the fact his group forced leadership

to cut the proposed tax increase represented a victory.

“We’d just as soon see no increase but we’re at the
point where we no longer can ignore the fact we have
to fund the educational institutions of this state,” he
said. We recognize the battle is over and this is a com-
promise.”

The House_ must still approve the measure before
the state-related universities and institutions can get
their $300 million aid. Both houses still have to pass
the actual appropriation bills for the institutions.

Only one Republican voted for the tax and five
Democrats voted against it.

Under the last minute amendment, the proposed tax
increase was cut from 2.2 percent to 2.1 percent and
the proposed hike in the 9.5 percent Corporate Net In-
come tax (CNI) was increased from 10.5 percent 10 ll
percent.

The proposed income tax increase would add about
$10 to $20 to the average family’s tax bill beginning

Jan. 1. At one time, the Senate talkediofraising the _

tax bite by as much as $70 to $140 a year for most
families.

During the week, the tax proposal had been trimmed
twice, from 2.3 to 2.2 and then to 2.1. The latest figure
would yield $38 million this fiscal year.

But the Senate needs $300 million to pay for delayed
aid to the state-related universities and institutions.

Another $115 million will come from raising the 9.5
percent Corporate lncometax, CNI, to 11 percent, un-
der Nolan’s amendment. The last version of the tax bill
called for a 10.75 rate.

Leaders now say another $47 million can be generated
this year from a new 4.5 percent tax on electricity and
gas produced in Pennsylvania but sold in other states.
The same tax is already on in-state electricity and gas.

CAMPUS CRIME DROPS
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 17 YEARS

Campus crime decreased 6.9
percent in 1976, according to
campus police chief Curt Graham.

Graham said this decrease is the
ﬁrst crime drop at Pitt in 17 years.

He pinpointed the lower campus
areas, especially the dorms, library
and Student Union, as high-crime
areas.

One in 10 persons arrested by the
campus police are associated with
the University, Graham said,
adding students are usually the
victims of external crime.

According to Graham, the most
common crime on campus is theft,
which occurs mostly in unlocked
campus facilities. In 1976, 424
arrests were made from 1,818
reported incidents.

Graham said education of the
public and officer training are two
basic strategies of crime preven-
tion.

Graham said community rela-
tions officers on the campus police
force are trying to involve the public
in crimeiprevention. If Pitt students
and staff were alerted to crime,
extra precautions might be exer-
cised, and less crime might occur,
he added.

students from Pitt, Temple, Penn
State and Lincoln universities to the
Capitol steps.

Though he called the rally a
“professional job,” Posvar said the
administration, rightfully, did not
support the protest. “If we had
appeared to be behind it, it would
have deﬂated the impact.”

Posvar said the media thought
the protest had been engineered by
the administration because of its
organization, but he denied the
charge. “Give the students
credit,” he said.

Posvar also said the rally’s timing
was right. “To put pressure on two
months ago would have been
premature. We must avoid
animosity (when dealing with the
state legislature). “A lack of it
(protest) would have been very
harmful. Symbolically and politi-
cally, it was important.”

TheStote Legislature:
A View From Inside

(Continued from Page 1)
breaking the deadlock, the Senate
originally had 19 Republicans and 7
Democrats who rejected a tax bike
as a solution. The compromise
passed with the minimum required
(26), as two Democrats switched
their votes.

Among the anti-tax senators were
those with a sympathetic view
toward the universities and who
want to see them fully funded. GOP
Senator Richard Snyder was one of
those officials. “The non-prefer-
reds are at a reasonable level,” he
said. “It is too late to start cutting
their appropriation.”

Snyder preferred opening the
general budget to cut out “the
waste.” He said welfare was the
largest area where money could be
found. “They have overstated their
needs,” he said.

No-tax legislators’ main concern
is the state’s economy and the
possible loss of industry to other
sections of the nation. They believe
raising the corporate net income tax
from 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent
would chase away more ﬁrms in an
area already strapped by recession.

Democratic Joseph Zeller attack-
ed the universities directly for
allowing the situation to reach this
point. He noted Pitt’s original
request when it became state-relat-
ed in 1966 was some $5 million that
has now inﬂated to $62 million.

He criticized the universities for
wasting too much money, saying he
would like to see them face cuts in

their appropriation. Zeller said his

constituency would not tolerate any
further tax increases.

Representative Kurt Zwikl (D),
(Dem.), who supports a tax
increase, said, the tax should not
exceed the 1974 corporate and
personal tax levels (9.5 percent and
two percent).

Zwikl accused the Republicans of
playing politics, refusing a tax
increase in order to please the
voters in next year’s election. The
entire House, half of the Senate and
the Governorship, are facing
election in 1978.

Earlier this week, Zwikl said
passage of funds could come at any
time--this week, next week or even
next year.

With the Senate’s passage, the
House must now act on the tax
proposal, which will have to

money is to go to the universities

However, Pitt’s student lobbyists
discovered, the problem was each
legislator had his own pet way of
solving the crisis, leaving little
chance for a joint effort that will
secure enough votes for the passage
of any solution.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

No Big Favor

According to the National Association of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges, Pitt’s resident tuition fee ranks higher than
its football team—number three in the nation among state-related

0.

colleges and universities.

We doubt this bit of information comes as a surprise to many
students here. Reaching deepinto pockets and purses for tuition
and fees has become a tradition at Pitt.

It is worth noting, however, that Temple and Penn State, Pen-
nsylvania’s other large, state-related institutions, are also in the top

five.

Their sharing of Pitt’s dubious distinction says something
about the continuing budget crisis.

Judging from the long delay in providing funds to state-related
schools, one might get the impression the legislators are being
asked to do something extraordinary as if the appropriations would
mark a new high in the annals of state educational allotments. In

indicate otherwise.
Pennsylvania citizens believe,

' fact, the expenses borne by students at Pitt, Penn State and Temple
No matter what the legislators would have
approval of the schools’

full

appropriations would be no big favor.

Still, the news out of Harrisburg last night was encouraging. The
State Senate compromise that resulted in a slight tax increase put
Pennsylvania’s budget impasse one major step closer to resolution.
The State House must still approve the Senate bill, and the schools’
appropriations themselves must be passed, but the Senate decision
is the first sign of life from the Legislature in a long time. Though
the budget crisis is not yet over and further problems remain a
possibility, this latest development is welcome.

it is not, however, sufficient cause for the Harrisburg crowd to
start passing out self-congratulations. Pitt students will not forget
the school’s number three tuition ranking. We sincerely hope the
legislators aren’t expecting any pats on the back from this quarter.

Letters To The Editor

Carmichael a Reactio nary

Last week, Stokely Carmichael
spoke at Pitt. What did he say? In
between calling members of the
audience stupid children, CIA
agents and traitors who are crazy
unless they support his sideshow,
the All-Afrikan Peoples Revolution-
ary Party, and his rhythmical
ranting of ultra-revolutionary phra-
ses about scientiﬁc socialism, he
put forward chauvinistic, metaphy-
sical and reactionary views that

The Lingering History of Discrimination

In response to Dan Mulholland’s
recent column: I would first like to
say that your grandparents did not
do me any big favor by “freeing
me.” If your grandparents had
minded their own business in the
old country of Europe and left my
grandparents to mind their own
business in the_ old country of
Africa, affirmative action programs
and the Bakke case would be
non-existent and pointless. How-
ever, your grandparents did not
mind their business, so here we are,
afﬁrmative action and all.

How can you call yourself an
honest individual and say the
majority of whites in this country
today have grandparents and

_ nts who were treated harsher
than blacks? If that were the case
wouldn't the white majority instead
of the black minority be the ones in
need of afﬁrmative action pro-

‘grams?

Iamamazedbyyournaivete. Did
your grandparents lie awake nights
fearing avisit bythe Ku Klux Klan?
Do you have a-grandfather who is
approaching 90 years of age and still
shining shoes? Ido. Do you have a
mother who is 59 years old and

leaves her house every morning
except Sunday to clean someone
else’s house for $75 a week? I do.
Blacks have suffered physically and
emotionally and "are still suffering.

Of course, it has always been
illegal to deny equal protection of
law to any person. Yet, all of a
sudden you seem to remember
there is a 14th Amendment, when
your “poorly treated” grandpar-

ents and parents forgot one existed.

during the Jim Crow laws of the
19S0’s. The tables are turned and
you jump on your soapbox quoting
the 14th Amendment and expect
everyone to sit up and take notice.

Black people have been quoting the
whole damn Constitution for at least

_ 100» years and who listened?

Now you want to lay some
psychological guilt on me by saying
the beneﬁciaries of aﬂirmative
action programs are suffering
because afﬁrmative action pro-
grams are degrading. What can be
more degrading than being packed
like a can of sardines in the bottom
of a boat for months with 200 other
people? What is more degrading
than hearing over and over again
that your ancestors ran around the

jungle swinging from trees with no
history, culture or language to
speak of‘? What is more degrading
than having someone tell you, after
you've put in a hard day's work
scrubbing someone else’s ﬂoor, to
give up your bus seat to a white man
who probably sat on his behind all
day? Utter degradation is when
they arrest you for refusing to give
up the seat. Where is the 14th
Amendment now? We have been
down so long that the only place to
go is up.

Afﬁrmative action programs are
and must be a part of that uplifting.
For years we have been told that we
are not good enough to make it on
our own, but now because you fear
that too many of us are making it
with the help of afﬁrmative action
programs, you are telling us we are
equal enough to make it without
special help. It does not work that
way.

You cannot tell a person he is not
equal to you for over 200 years and
then turn around one day out of the
blue and say, “Hey, man, we are
equal now.” It takes much more
than that. It takes a whole lot more.
If this country is to realize its basic
goal of equality for all, programs
such as afﬁrmative action must be
implemented to achieve this goal.

In closing, I would just like to say
afﬁrmative action programs are not
here to stay, just as slavery was not
here to stay. Slavery served a
purpose, as do afﬁrmative action
programs. Now that the shoe is on
the other foot, I suggest you and
Mr. Bakke suffer through and wait
out afﬁrmative actin programs, like
my grandparents suffered through
and waited out slavery. Also I
suggest that you try to overcome the
discrimination of afﬁrmative action
as I am trying to overcome the
discrimination of slavery.

support the capitalist system, which
he claims to hate, by splitting
revolutionary forces, misleading
and misdirecting the struggles of
the people.

Stokely’s chauvinism was shown
clearly when he said blacks were the
only people marching in the streets
in the 1960's. Other than the fact
that this was an out-and-out lie, this
completely belittled all other
revolutionary struggles that were
waged by Chicanos, Puerto Rican
people, American Indians and the
white working class, right along
side of the Afro-American people.
This was an attempt to divide the
people and to mystify the objective
unity of all progressive movements
that oppose and weaken imperial-
ism.

Stokely said there is no such thing
as an Afro-American, and that all
blacks are really Africans who
should return to their home
continent. He said that a black
worker has more in common with an
African worker across the sea than
with a fellow U.S. worker who
happens to be white. Who would
believe Stokely would put out the
sameline as Lester Maddox and
George Wallace? This weakens all
workers’ ability to ﬁght U.S.
monopoly capitalism, the system
based on proﬁt and exploitation that
leads to unemployment and inﬂa-
tion, and continually drives the
people further and further into the
dirt. It liquidates the black national
quesiton, denying the importance of
Afro-Americans waging a national
liberation struggle that would
certainly weaken U.S. imperialism.

ted, stable community of people

By GARY GRAFF

Several weeks ago, Pennsylvania
followed many of the nation’s large
cities by passing strong, statewide
anti—pornography legislation. Two
bills, one concerning “kiddie porn”
and the other concerning the
publication and sale of pornograph-
ic materials, were introduced and
passed.

The latest of the two laws, which
was passed over Gov. Shapp’s veto,

deﬁnes pornographic material as:
(1) Material the average person
ﬁnds appealing to prurient inter-
ests; (2) Material containing subject
matter depicting or describing
sexual activity in a patently
offensive way; and (3) Material that
lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, educational or scientiﬁc
value.
There was deﬁnitely merit in
striking out at “kiddie porn,” the
use of youths under 18 in sex related

the -latest law is a ﬂagrant violation
of the rights of freedom of the press
and freedom of enterprise.

No person is forced to purchase or
read pornographic literature. Yet,
if there really is such a pressing
need to “protect the average citizen
from offensive, pornographic liter-
ature,” it might be more advanta-
geous for the Pennsylvania Legis-
lature to enact laws regulating the
sale and display of such materials.

Pennsy|vonici’s Porn Laws Subjective

Such a law was passed in Chicago
during the ﬁrst week of July. The
city passed an ordinance that pro-
hibits sex-oriented businesses from
operating within 1,000 feet of each
other and within 1,000 feet of a
residential area, school or place of
worship. It also prohibits the
display of sexual materials in the
windows and requires shops to
register with the city revenue
department. The law does not
affect existing establishments, but
limits new operations to certain city
zones.

The Chicago ordinance is not a
good law. It violates business's

The Pitt Young Socialist Alliance
participated in and strongly sup-
ported the Harrisburg demonstra-
tion called by students at the four
state-related universities. This
demonstration represented a step

in the right direction—a step’

towards the mobilization of the tens
of thousands of students, faculty
and staff against the massive
budget cuts we are facing.

The crowd demonstrated they
were fed up with the buck passing
of the Democratic and Republican
politicians and demanded mis-
leaders “pass the bucks” for the
schools.

The Democrats and Republicans

pose a false choice of tax hikes on
wage earners or cutbacks in social
services and education without
tuition increases or cutbacks is

possible. The priorities of our state

and Federal governments must be

reset. The Federal government is

spending $117 billion on the war
budget, discovering new ways to
kill millions. Instead, this money
should be used to provide

education, social services and jobs
for all. When our state legislators
talk of taxing working people, we
say instead, tax the banks and
corporations that are making huge
profits and use this money to
provide the educaiton that we
need.

The budget crisis and the huge
interest payments now going to the
banks will soon throw Pitt into a
severe cirsis. Cutbacks in staff and
faculty, huge tuition increases and
perhaps the closing of the
University are all on the agenda
unless we act now.

The Pitt YSA urges further
demonstrations such as the one in
Harrisburg on Tuesday. We should
reach out and involve more
students, the faculty and staff
unions and the community to
increase the pressure on the
do-nothing State Legislature.

Homosexuality and Demonstrable Truth

After reading Mr. Shope’s
Biblical objection to the practice of
homosexuality (Pitt News, Nov. 7)
and his subsequent cruciﬁxion by
Chris Grant and an unnamed
assailant in the November 9 issue, I
felt compelled to enter the arena in
an effort to clarify some issues.

Unfortunately, Mr. Shope failed
in advancing a reasonable Biblical
argument largely due to his own
contradictory statements. How-

ever, it would be a mistake to think
a refutation of Mr. Shope is a
refutation of Christian morality.
Among other things, Christianity
asserts God is really there and He
is not silent. If the Christian God
exists, and if He possesses those
characteristics that Christianity
attributes to Him, then He sets the
standard for all morality. If the
Bible is His divine communication
to man, then it is to be heeded and

A Positive Perspective

Those of your readers interested
in making an intellectually honest
investigation into the theological
debate over the issue of homosexu-
ality have a right to know there are
eminent theologians (e.g., Norman

. Pittenger and Gregory Baum) who

90*’

elieve the biblical references to
homosexual behavior do not
necessarily refer to homosexuality
at all (which was not within the
conceptual framework of those who
wrote the Bible), but to hetero-
sexuals engaging in homosexual
behavior in the context of either
idolatry or lust. The Bible, it is
affirmed, does not condemn
homosexuality. In fact, it really
doesn’t deal with it at all.

It is now known that approxi-
mately 10 percent of the general
population is homosexual in orient-
ation. This means that in the
United States today, there are an
estimated 23 million persons of
homosexual orientation. A recent
letter in The Pitt News (Nov. 7)
tells your readers that, if advice is
desired, “just talk with your
favorite priest or rabbi." After all,
the writer reasons, “The doors to
all churches and synagogues are
open to all who seek counsel."
What that statement does not tell

your readers is that the spiritual‘

leaders of most churches and
synagogues do not inform those
who seek counsel of any positive
way to interpret biblical references
to homosexual behavior. The
reasons for this are complex, but
most often they can be traced to the
fact that the vast majority of
priests, ministers and rabbis

»'

simply have not dealt with the
issue.

The fact is, nonetheless, that
there are a number of organizations
in this city and in most cities that
deal with homosexuality in a
positive way. In Pittsburgh, some
churches affirm God’s love is
poured out to people, regardless of
their sexual orientation, and afﬁrm
that message without relegating the
Bible to irrelevance or paralyzing
the intellect with -prejudice and
fears. There is a counseling center
that specializes in help for sexual
minorities, a center whose philo—.
sophy is rooted in an affirmation of
the right of individuals to accept
the lifestyle suitable for them.

We do not choose a doctor
without ﬁrst assuring ourselves he
or she is competent and willing to
heal rather than inﬂict needless
pain. In a matter has personal as
sexual orientation, any priest or
minister or rabbi will not do.
People have the right to know the
options and then make a choice.

its morality adhered to.

The unnamed respondent is

“there is such a thing as ‘God,’ or

right to freedom of enterprise and
proﬁt. Yet, there is no part of the
ordinance that is subjective. The
ordinance is clearly stated and
inﬂexible.

The Pennsylvania law, on the
other hand, is totally subjective.
The State Legislature’s deﬁnition of
pornographic materials uses catch
phrases, such as “patently offend-

ing” and “seriousliteraryorartistic
value,” phrases that need to be
deﬁned. V

Perhaps with President Carter’s
election, a wave of puritanical
beliefs is sweeping the country.
Regardless, nothing is being
accomplished. Kiddie porn laws are
being supported and enforced, but
laws such as the new Pennsylvania
law and the Chicago ordinance do
not have the support of the press or
merchants, and are virtually
ignored by consumers. Those who
want pornographic materials will
continue to purchase them, and
those who don’t want them will
continue functioning as they have
for most of their lives.

There is little sense in passing
anti-pornolgraphy laws such as the
new Pennsylvania ruling. There
has been no need for such
legislation in the past, and it is
doubtful that laws that violate
inalienable rights are really needed
or desired today.

Foiled Again

The article, “Panther Fencers
Debut,” paints a very unfavorable
picture of fencing in the Pittsburgh
area. Since September, the local
division of the Amateur Fencers
League of America has hosted
competitions on five different
weekends, at any of which Pitt
fencers would have been welcome.

However, if the students who fence
at Pitt would prefer not to compete
against more experienced AFLA
fencers, this spring they could join
the eighth season of competition
among the local colleges.

NO SPACE PROBLEMS
EXPECTED

NEWARK, NJ. (AP)—Evelyn
Hu, a physicist who is one of 120
applicants for astronaut positions in
the U.S. space shuttle program,
says she thinks men and women can
work well together in space.

“I can't foresee any problems
working with men,” said Miss Hu,
30. “As to a full-ﬂowered romance
in space, I can’t see it. There would
just be too many other things to
do.”

Miss Hu is a research physicist at
Bell Laboratories in Holmdel.

Fifteen “mission specialists’ ’ will
be selected to work on shuttle
ﬂights ‘planned by the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration in the 1980’s. Selection is to
begin late this year or early next.

Miss Hu, a native of New York
City, says 17 candidates are women.

A NASA spokesman said it was
likely at least one woman would be
chosen for the shuttle work because
of the agency's affirmative action
program.

. REACTOR ACCIDENTS LIKELY
SCIENTISTS SAY

WASHINGTON (AP)—A
group of scientists opposed to
nuclear power charged Thursday
that serious reactor accidents are 20
times more likely than the
government’s basic estimate, and
may kill thousands in the next few
decades.

The Union of Concerned Scien-
tists sharply criticized the more
optimistic ‘ ‘Rasmussen Report, ’ ’
which has been the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's funda-
mental safety study since 1974.

The scientist group said its own
“corrections” of the Government
study lead to forecasts of some
14,400 cancer deaths due to nuclear
power plant accidents within the
next 23 years if the program grows
rapidly.

An NRC oﬁicial, Ian Wall, said in
an interview he thought most of the
objections from the scientists were
not valid. But Wall, chief of the
NRC probabilitistic analysis
branch, admitted there were some
questions in nuclear safety analysis
that the Rasmussen study did not
attempt to answer.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN
GOLDSTEIN CASE

KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP)—-
A mistrial was declared Thursday in
the obscenity trail of Al Goldstein,
publisher of Smut and Screw
magazines, when a Federal court
jury said it was unable to agree on a
verdict.

The jury of seven women and ﬁve
men had deliberated nearly 14
hours over three days before
deciding it could not reach an
agreement in the case involving the
New York publisher, a former
partner and their publishing
company.

Alvin Goldstein, 41, and former

Stockbridge, Mass., had been
charged with illegally mailing into

TEAM LOOKS FOR LOST
URANIUM

BLAIRSVILLE, Pa. (AP)—A survey
team is searching carefully for
radioactive uranium residue at a
95-acre industrial dump near this
Indiana County community.

The search is part of a Federal
Department of Energy (DOE)
survey looking at 50 sites where
nuclear research and production

all outside the state.

The residue was left over from

the nation’s early atomic energy
program.

“It was decided it might be wise
to take a look at these old sites,”
DOE spokesman James Alexander
said Thursday. “These sites were
used in trying to gear this country
up to the new venture into atomic
energy.” '

_ ‘Sibling acts are not uncommon
in Pitt athletics--brothers Jeff and
John Pelusi both played for the
football team, Billy and. Terry
Knight both were on the court for
Panther basketball,-and Lisa and
Maria Sciullo both ran for the
Pantherette track team.

The latest entry in this category is
the Delaney brothers--Jeff and
Lindsay. If starting quarterback

Matt Cavanaugh had not been
injured in the season’s opener,
freshman Lindsay might well have
spent the season on the bench, since
few teams rotate an established
player with an inexperienced
newcomer. But Lindsay stepped in,
and his ﬁrst pass as a Pitt

quarterback was snapped up and
converted for a touchdown.

“I know Matt got hurt last year,
and while I was hoping to get some
playing time this year, I really

Panther football players Jeff and Lindsay prove...

didn’t want to get it through Matt’s
injury,” Lindsay said. “I was just
hoping that if we were playing well
enough, they’d put me in.”

The Delaneys played on the same
high school football team in Upper
St. Clair, but the two-year age gap
between the brothers meant more
then, because Lindsay got scarcely
any playing time.

Jeff came to Pitt in 1975,
attracted by its academics and its
proximity to home, and found a
place on the Panther defense.
When Lindsay followed suit two
years later, he said following in
Jeff’s footsteps had nothing to do
with his decision--he was inﬂuenced
by the dentistry program.

“We’re on the same team but we
don’t play together," Lindsay
pointed out. “We run into each
other at practice sometimes.”

Still, there are connections. Jeff
admitted that when he watched
Lindsay play, “I was pulling for him
a little harder because he is my
brother.”

For Lindsay, there is not only a
reputation to live up to, but the
desire to make one of his own.

“I’d like to make a reputation for
myself just as Jeff has done.”
Lindsay said. “It'll be something to
work for."

On the other hand, having an
older brother on the team can be a
deﬁnite plus. ‘

“When I came here, I didn’t
know anything," Jeff said. “I
didn't know what to expect. I know
that from his just coming down to
visit on weekends, he met
everybody on the team, that he
knew everybody on the team as well
as I did. So he wasn’t lost at all. He

had all kinds of friends and knew
what to expect.”

Actually, the brothers see very
little of each other. Outside of
football and family reunions, they
have little in common. Studies take
up a great deal of time for each--J eff
is a biology and economics major
with an eye on both medical and
business school, Lindsay is a
predental student.

Jeff claimed that between

football and classes, spare time is
virtually nonexistent, and Lindsay
echoed the complaint. Last
summer, between a construction
job, football practice and workouts,
Lindsay said he scarely had time to’
indulge in his favorite past
tirne--scuba diving.

The Delaneys may not be much
alike, but they may well become the
most productive brothers act in Pitt
sports.

Sports Media Fields Open to Women

By KAREN KADILAK
Pit1New~ Staff Writer

“As long as a sports journalist
does his or her job, it really doesn’t
matter whether you’re a man or
woman. You will be treated
equally. Criticism—you can let it
defeat you, or you don’t have to let
it defeat you. You can move on. I
can complain loudly, but I don’t
want to do that. If I wasn’t being
given a fair deal, I wouldn’t be
doing what I’m doing now.”---Lee
Arthur, woman sportscaster.

“I’m content to do my thing. It

i‘®‘(loesn’t matter if you’re a man or

woman. Idon’t feel I ever lost a job
because I was a woman.”---Joyce
Aschenbrenner, _assistant sports
information directoi at Pitt.

“The future is wide open for
women in sports reporting. Women
are becoming increasingly re-
spected. If she has the talent and
ability, there’s no telling how far a
woman can go as a sports
wr1ter.”---Pohla Smith, UPI re.
gional sports editor.

Although it’s hard to believe in

_.  the age of Phyllis George and equal

R-it

 

opportunity, not too long ago, the
idea of a woman reporting sports
was considered abusrd.

Many felt there was no way a
woman could break into a
traditionally male—dominated ﬁeld
like sports journalism and broad-
casting. The obstacles were just too
great for a woman to do such a
thing.

But the trend has changed in the
past 10 to 15 years. The inﬂux of
sports journalists that has emerged
in the past decade or so has proved
that on the whole, women can
write, report and broadcast sports.

Pohla Smith, regional
editor for United Press Interna-
tional (UPI)~ in Pennsylvania and
West Virginia, thinks women will
make even greater strides in the

future.

sports 

Smith, when named to her
present position at UPI, became
the first woman sports editor for
the world’s largest wire service.

“I see more and more women
starting everywhere,” Smith said.
“Most cities in the country have
one or two sports editors. Women
are getting more and more into
sports publicity, sportscasting, as
well as sports writing. All phases of
sports journalism. It’s remark-
able.”

Traditiional barriers that once
stopped women from pursuing
careers in sports reporting grad-
ually are being torn down. The
National Hockey League (NHL)
was the ﬁrst to remove one of the
biggest obstacles women have
faced over the years, by allowing
women into the lockerroom for
post-game interviews.

All but four NHL Clubs allow
women into the locker room.

Lee Arthur, former sports
reporter for KDKA radio and
television in Pittsburgh and now
weekend sportscaster in Miami,
thinks the other professional teams
will soon allow women into their
locker rooms.

“I’ve never been faced with the
problem, since I don’t do most of
my interviews immediately after
the game. But it’s only a matter of
time before decisions will be made
by teams and leagues to better
accomodate women working on a
deadline for a paper who need to go
into the locker room right after the
game.”

Smith is one of the women who
has to beat strict deadlines.
However, while covering the
Steelers on a regular beat, she has
found the inability to enter the
locker room to be no problem.

In fact, Smith thinks it’s to her
advantage to conduct her interview
outside the locker room.

““The only disadvantage’ a

woman sports reporter has is not
being able to gain access to the
locker room after the game. But
that doesn’t really bother me. I
don't like pack journalsism, where
the reporters are standing 20 deep,
writing down everything a coach or
player has to say and coming up
with,the same bunch of quotes.

“I think I get a better interview
outside the locker room. They’re
usually more relaxed, and they’re
more apt to talk to one person
rather than 20 or 30.”

Joyce Aschenbrenner, assistant
sports information director at Pitt,
agrees. She thinks a man is apt to

say more to a woman sports

  

reporter during an interview than
to a male sports reporter.

“They feel more at ease or
something," Aschenbrenner said.
“They don’t seem to get as bogged
down in the technical jargon talking
to a woman as they do a man.

“I know I had this case last year,
where a shot putter on Pitt’s track
team started to talk about his
mother and brothers. In the middle
of the conversation, he told me,
‘Gee, I’ve never talked about
things like that before with a
reporter.’

“He kept on talking,” said
Aschenbrenner. “He looked re-

lieved that he could talk to me

  

about something other than track.
He was talking about things I knew
he would be uncomfortable talking
about with a man.”

Arthur said she thinks women
will get into more play-by-play
announcing. Play-by-play is one
area of sports reporting that has
been closed to women in the past.

“I've thought about it a lot,”
Arthur said from her Pittsburgh
home. “I’ve done play-by-play for
women’s basketball, and enjoyed
that immensely. I’ve thought about
making a move and doing some
soccer play-by-play too. In Florida,
it’s the best game going right now.
I just love it.”

Dy, Katt in “First Love”-- Appealing but Banal

By ANGELE ELLIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
First lave
Directed by Joan Darling
Paramount

Disliking a love story is like
disliking a puppy. Something that
cute, albeit slobbery, can’t be all
bad.

Neither is “First Love.” Except
for more sex and franker language,

it contains all the cliche love story
devices: walks in the rain, talks in
the woods and a teary train station
farewell.

Elgin Smith (William Katt, who
played Sissy Spacek’s ill-fated prom
date in ‘‘Carrie’’) is an earnest,
soccer-playing college student who
rejects one-night stands in search of
an ideal, Dantean love. He feels he
has found’ it in cool, wealthy
Caroline Hedges (Susan Dey). But

Caroline is no Beatrice; she leaves
Elgin for her first lover, a
middle-aged lawyer.

Elgin, after the requisite fuming
and moping, dons a suit and makes
a sincere plea to the lawyer, who
sends Caroline back. But her return
leaves Elgin dissatisﬁed; “first
love” has become second best. He
ends the affair, deﬁnitely sadder
but doubtfully wiser, and presum-
ably returns to soccer.

Katt, whom some critics compare
to Robert Redford (close, but no
cigar), gives an initially engaging
performance. However, perhaps
due to the movie’s superﬁcial
script, he turns juvenile and sour.
Dey is unconvincing in her role;
whether eating french fries, making
love or telling Katt about her
father's suicide, she displays a
“Partridge Family” emotional
range.

John Heard and Beverly D’an-
gelo turn in competent perfor-

mances as a philandering friend 

his long-suffering girlfriend.

This is Joan Darling's ﬁrst
attempt at directing a ﬁlm, and,
while she did a competent job on
television’s “Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman, ’ ’ she lacks movie-making
experience.

The musicl score, highlighted by
a Cat Stevens song, is sappy.

Kiss and Jimmy Carter Have a Lot In Common

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

When I ﬁrst saw Kiss on
television over three years ago, I
would have given them as much
chance to become rock superstars as
I would have given Jimmy Carter
becoming President of the United
States.

But sometimes the longest shots
bring home the most bacon, and
certainly have the heartiest last
laughs.

For here we are in 1977, and
Carter is in the White House, and
Kiss is without question, the most
popular rock’n roll band in North

Wait a minute, you say: I didn’t
vote for Carter and I can’t stand
Kiss. ~ My answer is: Somebody out

- there does--the vocal majority.

In many respects, Kiss and
Jimmy Carter are very much alike,
even though their chosen turfs--pol-
itics and rock’n roll--are not always
the two most closely related topics
in America.

For starters, both Kiss and
Jimmy Carter are hustlers.
Carter’s goal was the White House,
and he did everything in his power
to attain it. Kiss’s was superstar-
dom in the rock industry. Different
goals for different pgople, but goals

that were attained through the good
old American ethic of hard work.

In that respect, both Carter and
Kiss are the results of the American
dream: Longshots with high ideals,
willing to work their butts off for a
goal that was clearly deﬁned from
the start, but one that became more
appealing to the American public as
they came closer to it. The public
weighed the competition and, for
some reason, gave Carter and Kiss
the nod over more perennial and
well-known favorite sons.

When Carter came to the White
House, he offered an intelligent,
and seemingly refreshing, folksy
alternative to the bureaucratic
muddle we were exposed to during
Watergate.

Carter was a Washington outsid-
er who had never even held a job at
the Federal level. He grew peanuts
and was the Governor of Georgia.

As for Kiss, it comprises four
ambitious young men from the
streets of New York City, not a
group of disgruntled British super-
stars looking to form a new band or

an introverted poet laureate seeking.

to end the plight of whales.

Kiss offers a hard-rocking
alternative to, a new generation of
music fans, from age 10 to 16, who

The Band Rocks But
“Twilley Don ’t Mind ”

ByJIMFARERI

Pitt News Staff Writer

Dwight Twilley? Some hillbilly

banjo player? A middle-aged

Nashville slick? Country music’s
latest sensation?

Try none of the above. Twilley is
a rock’n roller. Listen to his new
album, “Twilley Don’t Mind,” and
watch the connotations of his name
disappear.

This is the Dwight Twilley Band’s
second album - of what might be
called Americanized-British pop
rock. Twilley is after the ideal mix
of rock and pop, wanting to retain
the best of both forms in his ﬁnal
product.

Nearly every number on ‘ ‘Twilley
Don’t Mind” ' - tl

   

through on Twilley’s intention. But
the LP does have its low spots, most
resulting from overzealousness.

The best numbers score as

ﬁrst-class rock tunes cut with a
loose and lively pop edge. Some
rely on a characteristic rock rhythm.
while others find success in
semi-country and rolling pop beats.
Twilley strives for electricity and
excitement. As he says in
“Invasion: ” “Only thing left to rely
on your rock’n roll...Let it
explode.”

The music, however, does not
always explode. Sometimes, as in
“Sleeping,” it takes ﬁve and
refuses to do anything. ‘ ‘Sleeping’ ’
is too lethargic, repetitive and
unimaginative to deserve immorta-
lity on vinyl. Not even a crew of
smooth violins can salvage it.

But only one other tune, “That I
Remember,” comes close to
botching it like “Sleeping” does.

, The other seven numbers sit pretty

as various and original mergers of
rock and pop.

Foremost of the best is “Looking
for the Magic,” reveling in the
T willey speciality of stuttering,
quick-paced rhythm and vibrato. As

have no heroes. Groups like the
Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin are
of another generation, while softer
rock isn’t ferocious enough for high
school kids who are interested in
partying through the night, sports
and sex, though not necessarily in
that order.

Kiss plays basic and abrasive
sexual street rock that play on the
most primal of urges emerging from
young people moving from puberty
into adolescence. They also have
one of the most fantastic visual

   

shows ever assembled in the history
of entertainment.

Kiss does everything on a grand
level. Its members wear white
kabuki makeup designed to make
themselves look like inpenetrable
superheroes, coupled with. the
various concoctions of black leather
outﬁts and eight-inch high platform
boots.

Onstage, while they grind out
heavy metal, the stage» is done in
black as ﬁreﬂashes and lights
explode.

Bassist Gene Simm ns

breathes ﬁre and spits fake blood.

Singer Paul Stanley is the
spokesman for the band, exulting
the merits of partying and rock’n

roll. Lead guitarist Ace Frehle‘y‘g'.a

guitar explodes, while drummer
Peter Criss’s drum kit elevates 60
feet off the ground.

These sort of tactics may sound
excessive to the serious music lover,
but to impressionable young kids,
never exposed to so called “good

music,” Kiss is the greatest thing
since a sick teacher.

Merchandising also played an
important role in taking Carter and
Kiss to the heights they enjoy today.

Carter has a_soft spoken, likeable
demeanor behind a toothpaste grin.
Kiss has a super~hero leather’n
make-up image that is totally
dynamic. V

Both are making oodles of money.
Carter had a book out right after he
won the Presidency, explaining how
..v*':¢1€,.did it, while his brother Billy has
become a media hero, and now has
to carry home his money in a
wheelbarrow.

Kiss is everywhere. Most
magazine’s in the world have done a
feature on them, in fact Playboy is
doing one this month called “Kiss
on Tour in Japan,” a country where
they are as popular as the Beatles.

In addition, there is the ofﬁcial
Kiss fan club (The Kiss Army), plus
the numerous Kiss paraphrenalia
on the market: Kiss photos, Kiss
belt buckles, Kiss posters, Kiss
dolls and Kiss T-shirts. They even
have a comic book out published by
Marvel Comics.

Couplethis with nine best-selling
albums in three years and many
sold-out tours, and it’s not hard to
see why a boy might want to “play
in a rock’n roll band”. The ﬁnancial
rewards can be unbelievable.

However, like all dreams, both
the Carter and Kiss phenomena will
probably end in the years to come.
Carter is guarenteed at least three
more years in the White House,
with the re-election to a new term
guarenteeing him four more. For
Kiss, its career is probably over
when its fans reach 20 or ﬁnd
another act they can worship and
place their fantasies in.

but it is safe to say for now both
Jimmy Carter and Kiss are the
products of the classical American
Dream. *

Although they may not have had
the most talent, intelligence or
proper connections, they did have
the vision, guts and fortitude to
propel themselves before the
American public to succeed inliving
out their dreams. And if only for
that, they must be admired.

Bowl Scrapings
And Other Tidbits

Scrapings from the bottom of the bowls:

Pitt, after a trip through Jacksonville, Memphis and El Paso, is
- ck in Jacksonville—unless the Panthers get an unexpected in-
vitation from Miami. The Panthers, linked witht he Gator Bowl
more than a week ago, now are set to play Clemson Friday night,
Dec. 30, in the Gator unless the Orange Bowl takes Pitt ahead of
Penn State and Arkansas. The players voted Wednesday to take
a Gator Bowl bid if the Orange gambles against Pitt, and
Jacksonville sources say Pitt already has been chosen by the
Gator Bowl selection committee...

Penn State and Arkansas have made a deal, despite
protestations that will come from State College. The Orange
Bowl, the two schools hope, will chose either the Lions or the
Hogs; The other teams will take the Fiesta bid and play Arizona
State. If this deal were not fact, why would Arkansas——one of the
most attractive teams around—_s‘£ttle for a Fiesta bid_? They voted

 

for the Fiesta because they still believe they've got an excellent
shot at the Orange, but needed a backup bowl...

That deal was largely the product of Penn State coach Joe
Paterno’s refusal to consider for more than a second a deal that
would have put the Pitt-Penn State winner in the Orange Bowl, at
the Orange’s request. “It’s gotten to be that kind of rivalry,”
said a Pitt source...

Notre Dame, Obviously edgy about the idea Texas could lose
alter Nov. 19 (but before the Irish get a shot at the Longhorns),
would love to hold up the bowl picture by putting the Cotton
Bowl 'on hold—for about a week—when the call from Dallas
arrives at South Bend tomorrow. “We’d definitely like to wait
and see how the other teams (Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma) do,”
said a Notre Dame publicist. “But we wouldn’t dare.”

Notre Dame wouldn’t dare because Cotton committee member
Field Scovell greeted the idea of a Notre Dame “maybe” by
saying, “The Cotton Bowl will not wait. We will have a team
Nov. 19. If a team wants to wait, it will not be in the Cotton
Bowl.”

With the Cotton and Sugar set, the Orange Bowl now can af-
ford to wait until Nov. 26; whether it wants to is not so certain.
But Pitt’s main hope for a major bowl bid appears to rest on the
chance Arkansas could lose while Pitt was defeating Penn State..

More than one Pitt player relishes the idea of watching the

(§§1ge Bowl invite Penn State and then, a week later, forcing
A range Bowl officials to choke on leftover turkey as the Panthers
humiliate the Lions from coast to coast...

Pitt was in the Gator Bowl 10 days ago, but left for some
reason. The Panthers were in the Liberty Bowl for little more
than a few hours, until the Liberty committee’s lust was ‘directed
toward a Big Eight runnerup spurned by the Gator Bowl. Then
Pitt became cozy with.the Sun Bowl, and appeared “in” at El
Paso. But after realizing it was better to get as close to a major
bowl as possible, Pitt and the players decided to take Jackson-
ville...

The Pitt Hockey Club will take to
the road this wekend for a
two-game series against Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio.

The Panthers will be at full
strength physically for the Friday-
Saturday night series against a
team that head coach Len Barcalow

 “could be full of surprises."
 1’ calow said Miami is one of the

few teams with a junior varsity
squad, and will periodically substi-
tute an unknown junior varsity
player into a varsity gameto catch

the opposing team off guard. Other
knowledge of the Miami squad is
limited, not having played them
last year.

Barcalow did say the Panthers
will have to play an almost ﬂawless
game if they hope to defeat Miami.

“Hockey is a game of mistakes,"
Barcalow said. “A good team and a

winning team won’t make too many .

mistakes, because, .when you do,
the other team will capitalize on
them, and that's when you get
nailed."

Felder Fumes Over Inactivity

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt football player LeRoy Felder
has been feeling lonely these days.

Opposing teams, the Panthers’
right cornerback noted, have been
throwing “considerably less” to
his side of the field this year than
last year.

“I can’t really tell you in
numbers how many more times
they threw to my area last year.”
the senior from Baltimore -said,
“but I can tell you it’s been
considerably less. _

“A lot less than last year,” he
added emphatically.

The situation puzzles Felder.
Why, he asks himself, haven't
more passes been thrown to his
side of the field‘?

“I often wonder why,” Felder
said. “I know they have respect for
me, but I don’t think they’re really
scared throwing the ball there.

“Why would they be scared
when they’ve been throwing the
ball down the center into Bob
Jury's area?” Felder continued.

“As good as he is, they still keep
throwing into his area, so they
must not be that scared.

“Maybe it’s because most teams
have right-handed quarterbacks.
Right-handed quarterbacks have a
tendency to throw the football to
the other side. I just don’t know.”

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill
thinks he does...and it’s not
because opposing teams have
right-handed quarterbacks.

“Evidently, LeRoy’s done a good
job covering his receiver,” Sherrill
said. “Right-handed or left-handed
quarterback, they’re going to throw
the football to the open receiver
anywhere on the field.

“Opposing quarterbacks like to
throw the football to an open
receiver, not a covered one.
LeRoy, just does one good job of
covering his receiver.”

Felder’s lack of defensive action
also could be attributed to what
seems to be a trend in college
football today, where more teams
are throwing more short and
medium-range passes instead of

» long ones.

Given the short and medium
stuff, quarterbacks aren’t looking
to the deep pass as much as they
did in the past.

Pitt, for example, hasn't gone

with the home run-type pass as
much as with the short and
medium-range passes to Gordon
Jones, Willie Taylor and Steve
Gaustad. '

As a comerback, Felder has
come up on the short end as far
as the number of passes defended.

“People are playing the cushion
more,” Sherrill said, referring to
the area between- the short and
deep defensive zones.

“This allows the teams to go to
more of the short and medium-type
pass than the long pass.”

Still, Penn State, who will play
10th ranked Pitt a visit next
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. has been
known to throw the deep pass, or
“bomb.”

Nittany Lion ﬂanker Jimmy
Cefalo has pulled in some long ones
over the years. So has Scott
Fitzkee, the glue-ﬁngered split end
Felder will cover for most of the
afternoon.

“I’ll be ready to meet the
challenge,” I-‘elder said. “Maybe
in the Penn State game, I can make
up for the ones I missed in the
other games._ I’ve been overdue,
you know.”

Majors’ Tennessee Home Not So Sweet

by the Associated Press

Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors,
in a Memphis newspaper interview,
reacted angrily to complaints about
his conduct on the sidelines during
the Vols’ loss Saturday to Ole Miss.

The Commercial Appeal reported
yesterday it had received several
complaints about Majors since the
43-41 Southeastern Conference
game at Liberty Bowl Memorial
Stadium. The newspaper quoted
sideline observers as saying Majors
used foul and abusive language and
verbally assaulted player Billy Arbo
just before the half. The Vol

“We just blew too many shots,
and they picked right up on them,”
he explained.

The meticulous nature of the
fifth year head coach came
through when he said, “Good
organization is the key to a good
club. If the guys skate their
positions, and they stay with their
men, they come off as an organized
team. But it’s when they allow
people to get by them and don’t

“Iwill bethe first to say that I get

categorically the things said about
me during the Old Miss game.

“I don’t physically or verbally
abuse people, especially players.
We don’t intimidate people and in
my entire coaching career I have
never cursed a kid or questioned his
ancestry.

“You know, when people have
you down there are some who like to
kick you, and I think these critics,

stay at their positions that they look
disorganized.”

In summing up the Miami game,
Barcalow said,“Miami will have a
good club; they always do. But our
club is just as good, if not better.
All we can do is hope for the best.”

Although the season is still
young, Barcalow seemed very
pleased with the Panthers’ per-
formance thus far (1-1), as they
attempt to better their 1976-77
season record of 12-5-1. The loss of
former captain Rick Vernon and
Scott Kimmick through suspen-
sion, and Russ Stump, who is

whoever and wherever they are, are
just showing a sign of weakness on
their part.”

Majors said he did get upset
when Arbo missed the pass just
before the half with the Vols
trailing, 30-0.

“We all miss passes and we all

make mistakes and I got on him
when he came to the sidelines,”
Majors said. "I grabbed him by the
jersey. But I didn't cuss him
out.” Arbo, a 6-1, 195-pound
junior from Knoxville, said “there
was nothing ﬂagrant” about the
incident.

What motivates an athlete to
work and train for a sport, to
physically abuse his body and risk
injury, when he knows there will be
no glory or recognition, and no
ﬁnancial rewards for his efforts?

“I love the sport,” said Pitt
hockey player Larry Gallick.

Gallick, a sophomore defense-
man from Montour High School, is
seeing his second year of action for
Len Barcalow’s club, and appa-
rently is enjoying every minute of
it. This is the case even though he
has no chance of getting any form
of scholarship from the team,
which receives no ﬁnancial backing

from Pitt’s athletic department.

“I love the competition.” Gallick
said. “I like to get on the ice in a
game and show the other team
exactly what I can do.

“l’ve been playing hockey since I
was about 13 years old,” he
continued. “I played four years in
high school, and when I came to
Pitt it seemed sort of a waste to
give it all up, so I joined the club.”

Barcalow is delighted the 5-9,
185-pound sophomore decided not
to give up hockey.

“Larry is a 100 percent go guy,”
Barcalow said. “When he's on the
ice, he handles the puck and skates
well. While he's bobbing and
weaving, the other team is weaving

and bobbing. You put Larry on the
ice and things start to happen. He
makes very few mistakes because
he is knowledgeable when it comes
to hockey.”

In the past, some people have
said Gallick does not receive the
recognition he really deserves.
Barcalow agrees whole heartedly.

“Absolutely! Larry has really
been underrated in the past, and
has not received credit for being
the great team player he really is.”

The ﬁfth year head coach praised
Gallick for his efforts off the ice as
well as on.

“Morally and mentally, Larry
Gallick is agreat person. I’m glad
we have him on the team.”

Gallick contributed to last

and Recognition

season’s 12-5-1 record, as a
freshman defenseman with six
goals and 14 assists. He hopes to
improve in the coming season.
“There is always room for
improvement,” Gallick said.
“When you come out of a game
and start telling yourself that you
played your best, that’s when you
stop improving. You can never
reach a best in anything.”
Gallick rated the overall perform-
ance of the Panthers this year.
“We have some of the best talent
around but we really haven’t
showed what we can do. ' Because

of our lack of practice, we really¢ 

haven’t had a chance to get
everything together. But when we
do, there will be no stopping us.”

Pitt-PSU Deal  

(Continued from Page I3)

Pitt athletic officials are talking about something else. But Jackie
Sherrill did students a favor when he said Penn State must play at
Pitt Stadium this year (unless, of course, the student lives in
Erie). There are'6,000i fewer seats at Three Rivers Stadium than
there are in Pitt Stadium, and you don’t need 6,000 guesses to

figure out who would have made the sacrifice.

Also Sherrill

believes a large student turnout will help his team, and one can
detect a glimmer of appreciation when Pitt’s‘ coach talks of how
the students have increased in number and volume...

The speculation that Pitt’s treatment of the Orange Bowl avyear
ago may have made a difference this year w_as dismissed in
peculiar fashion by the Orange committee member who said,

“The animosity left with Majors.”

Apparently, several

Miamians believed they had a committment from Majors before
the end of last season that was broken when Pitt chose Georgia,

the Sugar and ABC...

Just as House hearings in Washington are considering the
allegation the ABC, the Sugar Bowl and Pitt were involved in an
out-of-bounds deal last year, a Notre Dame spokesman says this:
“We have heard nothing about the story ABC is considering
making the Sugar Bowl more lucrative in an attempt to draw a
team to that bowl.” This was not said as a result of any direct

question concerning that rumor..

One governor, Florida’s Reuben Askew, failed in an attempt to
get his pet school into a bow. Gator Bowl officials told Florida
St. it was somewhere down near the Polish national soccer team
on its list of potential picks, partly because they were annoyed at
the governor’s meddling. That didn’t stop Arkansas Gov. David
Pryor from calling the Orange Bowl and letting the Miami

Chamber of Commerce know that he would help them sell, say,
35,000 tickets to the Orange Bowl if his Hogs were invited...

Gator Bowl officials, meanwhile, say they hope Pitt will bring
10,000 fans. They expect, however, about 8,000 or so...

It is not improbable the Orange Bowl will wait until Nov. 26,
since that is what it has wanted to do for some time. What stop-
ped them was the fear the other bowls would take advantage of

their indecision.
decided, that fear is gone.

But with the other two available major bids
‘‘If everyone wanted to wait, we

would,” said an Orange committeeman recently. “But wehave
to protect ourselves.” It now appears likely Penn State will get
the bid if it beats Pitt, Arkansas will get the bid if Penn State loses
while the Hogs beat Texas A&M, and Pitt will go to Miami if
both of the front runners fall. That would put Arkansas in the
Fiesta and Penn State in the Gator Bowl (or worse)...

The Rose Bowl, with Washington the possible Pacific Eight
representative, will be almost as dismal this year as the Orange

and Cotton were last year...

Speaking (or writing) of dismal bowls, how’s this scene: after

‘ the Cotton invites Notre Dame, Texas loses to Texas A&M; the

Sugar invites a two-time loser from the Big 10 and Alabama loses
its final regular season game; the Rose gets stuck with Michigan
and Washington; and the Orange gets Nebraska and a Penn State
team that loses to Pitt. It’s improbable that this would happen,
but don’t tell that to Jackie Sherrill.

games in the National Con-
ference—East.

“I want to play a whole game to
see what I can really do,” said
Dorsett, the former University of
Pittsburgh record-breaker who has
rushed for 522 yards despite only
part-time rookie duty.

Meanwhile, the Steelers, 5-4,
share ﬁrst-place with Cleveland
atop the American Conference-
Central.

Yet it has been an especially
severe season for Steeler injuries.
And it contrasts sharply with 1975,
when the Steelers started the
season with the same 43 players
who beat Dallas in Super Bowl X.

Middlelinebacker Jack Lambert,
defensive and L.C. Greenwood and

safety Don Shell will all likely miss
the Dallas game with knee injuries.

Those injuries mean Dallas will
likely test Pittsburgh’s defense up
the middle, where rookie Dennie
“Dirt” Winston will start at
linebacker and converted corner-
back Jim “Spider Man” Allen will
start at safety.

Beyond their physical problems,
the Steelers face some mental
challenges against the complex
Cowboy offense.

The Cowboys’ “ﬂex-defense”
also presents a preparation prob-
lem for Pittsburgh.

“There’s a preparation problem
for our whole defense because of
things they do we don’t normally
see,” said Steeler Coach Chuck

v

Noll, citing Dallas use of the
shotgun formation, men-in-motion
and assorted shifts.

However, the Dallas defense has '

allowed the lowest percentage of
pass completions in the National
Football League, and it leads the
league in quarterback sacks.

And safety Cliff Harris said the
Cowboys were playing a more
physical brand of defense than i

seasons past. _
“We’ve, got guys like Harvey

Martin, Tom Henderson, Randy
White, Bob Breunig, Benny
Barnes, and they’re all in there
hittin ,” Harris said.

“ e didn’t use to have that
many hard hitters. Now we’ve got
more guys who make the real
smashing hits.”

Beavers Strike Panther Bowlers

By GARY ZOLYAK

The Pitt bowling team took one of

three games last Saturday from
Community College of Beaver

County‘ at the Sheffield Lanes in.

Beaver County.

Pitt’s Mike Manjerovic’s 210
score led the way as the Panthers
took the first game, 845-789. The
Panthers nearly lost the six-mark
lead they amassed at the outset, but
blew it open with a barrage of
strikes in the ninth and 10th frames
to ice their hard-fought win.

Intramural Playoff A etion

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Slaffwriter

Delta Phi earned a berth in the
touch football Fraternity Division
championship by defeating Sigma
Chi, 16-15, and will face Phi Kappa
Theta at Pitt Stadium at 8:30 p.m.
Sunday for the title.

Sigma Chi got on the scoreboard
ﬁrst midway through the ﬁrst half
via a touchdown pass, then kicked
the conversion and led, 7-0. Delta
Phi, exhibiting a balanced offense
throughout the game, then began
working on the left side of the
Sigma Chi defense.

Chuck Pearce, Delta Phi quarter-
back, hit on consecutive passes to
Tom Simpson and Eric Jackson
putting the ball into scoring
position at the Sigma Chi 20-yard
line. Following an incompletion,
Pearce found Simpson in the end
zone, and the score was 7-6.
Electing to go for the two-point
conversion, Jackson made a diving
catch of Pearce’s toss to vault Delta
Phi on top, 8-7.

Sigma Chi had one more
opportunity to score before the half
ended, but two inrcompletions and
a ﬁne defensive play by Bill Smith
forced a ﬁeld goal attempt. Steve
Bober got high in the air to block

With spirits riding high into the
second game, Pitt opened up an
early lead. But CCBC’s Jerry
Foreman put out the Panthers’ ﬁre
by throwing a 267, leading the way
to an 896-792 rout.

Each week, at least one Panther
foe throws an exceptional game and
an exceptional series: W and J ’s
Denny Slaughter _ (616 series);
Robert Morris’ Donny Genalo
(256-662); Duquesne’s Joe Licause

(232-633); and‘ now Foreman’s
267-628.

the attempt (which proved to be a
big play) and Delta Phi held on to
the lead at halftime.

The lead was shortlived as,
following a punt, Sigma Chi
returned to the airways for its
second touchdown. The ensuing
two-point conversion upped the
count to 15-8.

Delta Phi was unable to move the
ball for much of the second half, as
poor ﬁeld position kept Pearce from
utilizing his ﬁne wide receivers.

The third game proved to be a
continuation of the second, as .t, ’
Panthers once again had troub c
with the sharp-breaking lanes, and
went down in an 867-789 defeat.

‘ ‘We should have beaten them all
three games,” junior captain Geoff
Joseph said after the match. ‘ ‘Of all
the teams we bowl, they are the only
ones who don’t have their own
lanes, so they never have a
home-lane advantage either.” ’

The Panthers will face Robert
Morris tomorrow a 1 p.m. in a
rematch at Strand Lanes.

   

With ﬁve plays remaining in the
game, Smith breathed some life
into Delta Phi by intercepting a
pass and returning it to midﬁeld.

With three plays left, Pearce
broke free on a run-pass option and
outran the pursuit for the touch-
down making the score 15-14. Delta
Phi wanted no parts of a tie;
Simpson put a quick move on the
cornerback, Pearce put the ball on
the money and Delta Phi had itself
a spot in the championship.
