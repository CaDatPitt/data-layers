Pitt senior Scott Grimes is going
after the seat that U.S. Rep, Mike

Doyle, D-Pa., has held since 1994. 

with little more than $100 and the
strength of his convictions.” '

At 29, Grimes, a communica-
tions major, is taking the spring
semester off to run for Congress
as a nonafﬁliated independent
against incumbent Doyle in the No-
vember election. Grimes said that

his decision to run arose from his:

personal research on the Occupy
movement and his dissatisfaction
with the current partisanship in

V government. — X
He said he is concerned that the

government doesn’t represent the
people’s true interests.

“My decision to run came out of
anger and feeling betrayed by my
own government,” Grimes said.
‘_‘There’s never been a better time

than now.”

Doyle said that while he hasn’t

with his opponent on a number
of issues, including the Occupy
movement and reducing special"
interests in political: elections.

“I’ve always supported public
ﬁnancing for elections,” Doyle
said..“I think we agree that a bet-
ter system keeps special interest
out of politics.”

Public ﬁnance is a system that
gives the same amount of money to
each candidate in a political race,

~ rather than having them try to out-
’ fundraise each other.

Doyle also said he supports a
number of the Occupy movement’s
goals and sent a letter'of support
when the movement began.

In the past eight weeks that he’s
been campaigning, Grimes said he
hasn’t spent more than $100 on
his candidacy and isn’t accepting
campaign donations from his sup-
porters. He feels political action
committees and lobby groups sway
the opinions and stances ofp01iti—
cians with their large donations.

Doyle said that he thinks public
ﬁnancing for elections is a better

system than Grimes’ “no dona-
tions” ethos because candidates"
need to reach all 700,000 resi-
dents of the district, and that takes
money. V

“There was an election out in
California where a politician spent
$50 million of his own-money on
his campaign,” Doyle said. “He
could have said ‘no’ to donations
too, and there Scott would have
been with his $100.”

Although Grimes admits that
not accepting campaign donations
gives him “a pretty‘ severe handi-
cap,” he said that he has turned to

social media to increase awareness '

of his campaign and goals.
Grimes said he is relying heav-
ily on social media because of the
low cost and broad outreach that
sites such as Twitter and Facebook

provide. As of Thursday,‘ Grimes _

had a total of 160 followers on both
his Facebook and Twitter sites.
He admits that without hefty
donations for campaign funds,
“it’ll be an uphill battle to generate
awareness” for his campaign.
‘But Grimes felt that now was

  Pitt seniorto challenge Doyle for 14th District

— heard of Grimes, he does agree

the right time to run because of
Congress’s single—digit approval
rating and the lack of a Republican
challenger.from District 14, which
includes Pittsburgh and some sur-
rounding municipalities.

“It seems like it’s becoming
more and more of a self—serving
government,” he said.

Grimes said that the unwilling-
ness of members of Congress to
work together on pressing eco-
nomic issues also inﬂuenced his
decision to campaign. He hopes
to make a statement with his cam-
paign and inspire other people to
run as well.

“I think there’s a general con-
sensus, especially among younger
generations, that the party can-
didates aren’t really thinking for
themselves or for the voters in
their districts,” he said.

Pitt professor Bernard Hagerty,
who had Grimes in his Irish and
America class last year, feels that
Grimes stood out among the crowd
because he has a “strong social
conscience” with “a bit of a rebel

Phil sees
shadow, ,
more winter
to come

/ .

By Zachary Harr
For The Pitt News

Jordan Walker, a native of Punx-
sutawney, Pa., said that for residents
of the town, Groundhog Day is like
the Super Bowl.

“Punxsutawney ‘Phil is like the
Steelers for Pittsburgh,” the junior
said.

Phil the groundhog saw his shad-
ow Thursday morning, which, ac-
cording to popular folklore, means
winter will continue for six more
weeks. Had he not seen his shadow,

tradition would have dictated an -

early spring. _
“As I look at the crowd on Gob-

bler’s Knob, many shadows do I see: »

Six more weeks of winter it must
be,” said Mikejohnston, vice presi-
dent of the Groundhog Club’s Inner
Circle, as he relayed Phil’s procla-
mation in front of the thousands
gathered.

Johnston and the rest of the In-
ner Circle — the board of directors
of the Groundhog’s Club —— aim to
protect and perpetuate the legend
of Punxsutawney Phil. They wear
tuxedos and top hats to all events
to show respect to the groundhog
that they believe is the pinnacle of
the animal kingdom.

The tradition comes from Ger-
man immigrants who believed that
groundhogs would come out of their
winter hibernations on Feb. 2 to see
if the weather was harsh or moder-
ate. The Punxsutawney celebration
— the largest in the World -— dates
backto the 18805. More than 15,000
people attended today’s celebration
in Punxsutawney. 1 .

The Inner Circle said multiple" ‘

times that meteorologists in atten-
dance should take a lesson from
Phil’s predictions, and Pitt junior
Sam Lindner agreed.

“I’m a ﬁrm believer in Punx-

sutawney Phil,” Lindner said. “He’s '

a groundhog who predicts the

Pitt lab worker makes faces  

By Mahita Gajanan
Sta_[f Writer

By day, he lives in a world of petri
dishes and microscopes. But off
the’ clock, Greg Lightner creates
monsters and zombies, severed
limbs and bloodied facesf L

On a normal day, Lightner, 35,
works as a lab prep director in the
biological -sciences department at
the University of Pittsburgh. He
helps students and instructors
with labs, assists with technical
support and prepares cultures for
labs. But in his spare time, Lightner
works as a professional makeup
artist, working on horror produc-
tions and doing makeup for actors
and brides.

What started out as a child-
hood love for creating gashes and
scars with makeup exploded into
a potential career in 2008 when
Lightner participated in the Zom-
bie Walk at the Monroeville Mall,
and people started noticing his
work.

“I had done myself and my
[then-]boyfriend’s makeup for the
event,” Lightner said in an email.
“I thought it was OK but nothing
spectacular. When we got there,
people started taking pictures left
and right and stopped us to ask
questions.” .

At the event, WQED’s televi-
sion show “OnQ” and the Pitts-
burgh Tribune—Review interviewed
Lightner.

“From that point forward I
started thinking, ‘Wow, maybe I
have a talent I should pursue,”’
Lightner said. “And so I started
learning everything I could about
effects and really pushing the
boundaries of what I knew how
to do and what could be done.”

Before the Zombie Walk, Light-
ner worked as an actor and makeup
artist at the annual Fright Night at
Kennywood Park. There he met
Heather Seigh, a fellow actor who
played a hand in helping Lightner
get a job at Pitt.

Seigh, 29, is also a lab prep di-
rector and met Lightner in 2004.

She said Lightner created the best

effects and would always show up
to Fright Night with his makeup
done. When Lightner became the
official makeup artist for Fright
Night, she always made sure he
did her makeup.

“I always went to him to get my

Zfjmakeup done because he was the

best one,” Seigh said. “I’ve known
him for eight years, and he’s been
doing my makeup since for any
special event.”

Lightner started off by just
painting effects on himself, but
soon he learned to create 3-D ef-
fects on his skin with cotton and
latex. Then he" learned how to make
prosthetics for his face.

After the publicity at the Mon-
roeville Mall, The Rage of the Stage
Players, a local theater company
that focuses on alternative themes
like horror, hired Lightner to do
the makeup for its play “Twisted
Monologues” in 2010. Lightner has
been working with the company
ever since.

James Shoberg, _co—executive
producer of the company, com-
mended Lightner’s dedication to
the craft. Even at his busiest, Light-
ner managed to design special ef-
fects for Shoberg’s plays.

Shoberg said he has seen the
work of many trained makeup art-
ists but that none of them compare
to Lightner, who taught himself
everything he knows. M

“It boggles the mind,” Shoberg,
35, said. “He’s the best we’ve ever
had, and I’ve had the easiest time
collaborating with him.”

Lightner’s growing portfolio
caught the attention of a casting
editor from the Syfy channel “Face
Off,” a reality competition show
for makeup artists. Lightner went
through a challenging six—month
audition process in 2011 and was
one of fourteen contestants chosen
for the show.

Lightner said the ﬁnal round of
the audition process involved put-
ting makeup on himself in front of
the judges. He decided to portray
himself as an infected scientist, but
his nerves got thebetter of him,

and he put too much blue color
in the makeup while mixing the
ingredients.

“It was such a fail,” Lightner
said. “I told the judges I that I did
the blue face so that they would
notice the red coming from my

' mouth.” A

Despite the blue face, Lightner
was cast on “Face Off,” a show that
would give him a large amount of
exposure to a world he had not
known much about before.

“One of my goals if I got on the
show was to meet others in the
industry who have the same in-
terests as I do,” Lightner said in
an email. ’ 2

Prior to “Face Off,” Lightner
had not made many friends in the
makeup industry, but his experi-
ence on the show led to a much
larger network.

“Almost the entire cast has
bonded from this experience, and
we are all very close now,” Light-
ner said. “We affectionately call
ourselves a family now. Needless
to say, I met my goal.”

Lightner was eliminated from
the show on the ﬁrst episode. He
said it was brutal.

“Nobody wants to be the ﬁrst
one off,” Lightner said. “But I can’t
believe I beat out thousands of peo-
ple just to make it on the show.”

For the ﬁrst episode of “Face
Off,” Lightner and his team of seven
men had to reimagine “The Won-
derful Wizard of Oz,” the children’s
book by L. Frank Baum. Lightner
worked on recreating the Tin Man
on a mannequin.

“The Tin Man actually cuts off
his own limbs in the book,” Light-
ner said. “Our theme was horror so
we created a half-tin, half-man.”

Lightner’s appearance on “Face
Off” has helped him out profes-
sionally by making him well—known
in the makeup world.

Injuly 2011, he did the makeup
for the ﬁlm “Corpsing,” a horror-
love story made by 72nd St. Films.
In December 2011, he was also
hired to do the makeup for a music
video for a local singer, Antoniette

weather. He’s just as reliable as our
meteorologists in Pittsburg .”

Although winter might be warm
now, Phil said that winter is nowhere
near over.

“Phil’s not concerned with the
weather today,” Johnston said.
“He’s concerned about the next six
weeks.”

’ According to Punxsutawney’s
Groundhog Club website, there has
been only one Punxsutawney Phil.
He’s said" to have a magical drink
of “groundhog punch” during each
summer’s Groundhog Picnic, giving
him seven more years of life.

.When Phil isn’t deciding how

long winter will be, he’s at the Punx-

suta.wneyMemorial Library in his
display case. The case is named the
“Groundhog Zoo.” The outside wall
is made of glass, so fans can visit
whenever they feel like making a
trip to the library. Other ground-
hog friends sometimes join him as
well. .

Pitt junior and Punxsutawney
native.Easton Kernich, along with
Walker, has been fully immersed
in Groundhog. Day culture from a
young age. 1 l  ’ ‘

Kernich and Walker said that
apart from the holiday itself, Punx-
sutawney holds groundhog parades,
festivals and picnics throughout the
year. There are also different stores
and shops that sell groundhog ap-
parel as well as homemade arts and
crafts unique to the area.

Kernich and Walker’s alma
mater, Punxsutawney Area High
School, has its own way to celebrate
the holiday. The school creates an
actual groundhog court, which is

. ‘ similar to many schools’ homecom-

ing celebrations. From the court,
students choose a Groundhog king
and queen, and they are present-
ed onstage at Gobbler’s Knob on
Groundhog Day.

Kernich described Groundhog
Day as a big party in the middle of a
ﬁeld where thousands gather to try
and see the 20—pound woodchuck.
The gates open at 3 a.m.-, but the

- earliest she has ever. arrived is at 5

a.m. Festivities leading up to the pre-
diction include singing and dancing,
a ﬁreworks show and a large bonﬁre
to keep fans warm.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett
was the special guest of the morn-
ing. It was only the second time in
the 126-year history of Groundhog
Day that a seated governor has made
an appearance. He was accompa-
nied by his wife, Susan.

Past. guests have included Bam
Margera, who is best known from
MTV’s “Jackass” series, and Bill
Murray, the comedic actor who
starred in the 1993 movie adapta-
tion of Groundhog Day. Johnston
said following the movie release,

'he’s put in around 1,000 hours per

year of work because of the spot’s
increased popularity and fame.

Kernich and Walker already have
high hopes for next year’s celebra-
tion. The holiday falls on a Saturday,
and parties back in Punxsutawney
are in the preliminary planning
stages. D

“Everyone should go [to Ground-
hog Day] ,” Kernich said. “It needs to
be on everyone’s bucket list.” I

The anatomy of Groundhog Day

Today, select graundhogs all over the United States and Canada will be the center

at a holiday that began in the late 19th century The groundhog, also known as a woodchuck.
is the largest member at the squirrel lamily. Legend suggests that when the
hibemating mammal emerges from his burrow on Groundhog Day, the midpoint
between winter and spring, he is able to predict weather. Fanfare, ceremony,
and a break lrom cabin lever catapults the small Pennsylvania town of
Punxmrtawney into the national spotlight.

“One of the things I will say is that he is a
person with a strong social conscience. You
could see that he felt it when we talked about
political corruption,” Hagerty said.

Hagerty said that Grimes stood out as a
student that was “morally uncompromis-
ing.” Although he thinks Grimes’ running is a
good idea, he wishes that he wasn’t running
against Doyle and thinks it will be “very dif-

ﬁcult” for Grimes to win.

Grimes currently works as a bartender
Downtown and considers. himself to be
“loosely involved” in Habitat for Humanity
on campus, although he said he wishes he
could have been more involved in student-
run organizations at Pitt.

‘ Grimes said that since he won’t be on tele-
vision or radio, it will be very difﬁcult for him
to compete with the incumbent, who spent
around $1 million in his last campaign.

Doyle beat Republican Melissa Haluszc-
zak in the 2010 election with 68.8 percent
of the vote. I ‘

Costa.

Lightner has since received many job
offers but does‘not want to leave Pitt’s prep
lab in the middle of the semester. He has
two gigs lined up for the immediate future:
making a custom prosthetic body part for a
customer and making a mock of the different
stages of bed sores for a medical company.

Lightner said many makeup and special
effects artists work with medical compa-
nies to make actual prosthetics such as
dentures.

“A lot of science is involved in this,” Light-
ner said. “A lot of chemistry. You have to
know what chemicals react together.”

Lightner has been invited to Transworld,
a haunters convention in St. Louis, Mo.,

this summer, where people who work on
haunted houses get together to buy props
and mingle.

Lightner still has not come to total terms
with his success in the business. He is sup-
posed to take something to Transworld to
sell to customers but has no idea how to
make his work tangible so that people ca
buy it. ~

“It’s going to be weird going to conven-
tions and being on the other side [of the
tables],” he said. “I’m not going to be an

attendee. I can’t even wrap my head around

that yet.”

For Lightner, the thrill of being a makeup
artist comes from the reactions of onlookers
to how realistic he makes his work.

“I like that what I make actually looks
real,” he said. “Even though it washes off in
the end, and all I have is a photo, I still get
that creative joy.” .

Online classes a viable alternative

The rise of online education threatens costly universities’ supremacy

By Nick Stamatakis .
Columnist

In today’s world, the basic idea be-
hind college is rather silly.

We spend a substantial sum of
money for the privilege of attend-
ing classes and earning credits. For
an in-state Pitt student,-the cost to
receive this service is $7,636 per
semester. V

Such a price tag seems unnec-
essary —— technology should have
driven down the cost of receiving
ﬁve to six classes worth of informa-
tion. In agriculture, for instance,
the production of 100 bushels of
wheat once required nearly 300
labor hours. Today, we only need
three hours to accomplish the same
amount of work. In steel manufac-
turing, the production of steel re-
quires 1,000 times less labor than
it required in 1900.

Yet for universities, the ‘cost of
producing one educated student
keeps increasing. If anything, tech-
nology seems to have made educa-
tion more expensive. As a result,
we’re forced to pay higher tuition,

-either through taxes or loans.

For many years, this was some-
what understandable. In education,
there was no equivalent to the plow
or improved furnace technology.
There was never a breakthrough
that made education more efﬁcient.
The thousand—year—old tradition of
a teacher speaking to students in
the same room’ was still the most
effective method.

But with the development of new
online learning methods, we’re now
close to achieving efficiency. For the
ﬁrst time the paradigm may shift:
The model of one teacher in a room
might soon become obsolete.

This transition is in beta mode,
to be sure, but early indications sug-
gest online learning has almost lim-
itless possibilities. This fall, for in-
stance, Stanford computer science
professor Sebastian Thrun devel-
oped an online course on artiﬁcial
intelligence, in which more than
160,000 students participated.

Thrun wasn’t just pleased with
the results of the experiment — he
was ecstatic. It turned outthat when
students interacted individually
with their computers, they achieved

a more personal level of education
because of the immediate feedback
loop from their responses. In fact,
in the concurrent lecture—based
version of the class he was simul-
taneously teaching, enrollment
dropped by 85 percent as students
found out how much easier it was
to learn online.

Thrun’s achievement isn’t a
ﬂuke. The Khan Academy, an on-
line teaching site that Salman Khan
developed after giving an online
lecture to a cousin struggling with
a math concept, has already given
more than 100,000,000 lessons.
Not only do these lessons cost a
fraction of what institutions would
require, but the instantaneous feed-
back they provide makes them more
personal than a lecture.

Given these two developments,
it’s clear that the centuries—old
structure of a college education will
need to change if administrators
want to lower tuition to a reason-
able rate. With online courses and
online universities, we won’t need
thousands of professors and educa-
tors all teaching the same material

Dress profes

By Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

I have a friend who used to wear a
suit to_high school once or twice a
week. On those days he walked a

.. little taller, sat a little straighter and

talked a little clearer. I think that
everyone, like my friend, should
be more appearance—conscious and
dress up on a regular basis for class,
especially in college.

Now I realize that above all, col-
lege students value sleep. Rolling
out of bed in the morning, throw-
ing on some sweats and running to
class is the option that allows for
the most time spent asleep. But I
think the disadvantages of dressing
down for class more than justify
the extra’ 10 minutes you’ll spend
dressing up.

Unless you’re in a gym class or
some sort of extracurricular involv-
ing strenuous physical activity,
sweats are an unnecessary part of
your day-to-day wardrobe. Sure,
you’re tired in the morning, but by
wearing sweats you’re guarantee-
ing that you’ll continue to be tired
for the rest of the day. It’s so much
easier to fall asleep in class if you’re
already swaddled in warm, comfy
fabric.

But if you dress up for class,
you’ll likely be wearing tighter or
sturdier clothes that keep you up-
right and awake. You’ll feel profes-
sional and alert, even if you haven’t
slept that much the night before. In
short, you’ll remain focused and
‘ultimately do better in school. And
during a time when we’re looking
for any edge we can get, why not
try something as simple as dressing
professionally? ‘

Another downside to wearing
sweats is that it’s unprofessional.
Although college is a time to have
fun and be yourself, you should be

r.__....

aware of the connections you could
make at any time of the day that
might help you in your future. You
never know if your professor will
recommend you for an internship,
or if a classmate will ﬁnd you a job
at his place of employment. Should
these situations arise, you’ll need
to be dressed for the occasion and
impress anyone you see, just in case
they can help you.

sienally - even before you graduate

business .casual clothes on a daily

E’ basis. If we learn how to properly

 dress ourselves now, we won’t look

like a mess when we have a real job
someday.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who
feels unattractive and unpresent-
able while wearing sweats. In fact,
I feel like a bum. When I look in the
mirror and see the baggy folds en-
compassing my body, it looks as if I
just gained 50 pounds. When I wear
sweats, I don’t feel pretty.

But when I dress up, I feel more
conﬁdent in myself. I know that I
look better, so my mood improves.
Dressing up allows me to be myself,
express myself through my clothes
and feel assured that l’ll be ready
and presentable for any situation I
encounter. I sit straighter and walk
taller and feel like I can conquer
the world when I’m wearing nice
clothes.

Dressing up is an easy way to
give yourself a self—esteem boost.
There are so many things that can
bring you down throughout the day
— from failed tests to mean friends
— that the small things you can do
for yourself, like dressing‘ nicely,
become invaluable.

I’m not saying that you have to
go as far as wearing a suit every day,
or even every week, but do put care
into the clothing you wear. Your ap-

' pearance matters, both in terms of
how you appear to people and how
you feel about yourself. Dressing up
will earn the respect of your peers
and boost your self—esteem.

So when you wake up tomor-

think twice about pulling on those
sweats and running out the door.
Take an extra minute and think

~ simultaneously. Instead, the very

best will be able to reach millions.

There are two big reasons why
this transition will be rough. First,
college is a lot more than just class-
es — it’s a cultural and self-devel-
opment experience that can’t yet
be replaced by an online module.
Furthermore, many of the classes
juniors and seniors take aren’t as
lecture—oriented, and are taught
using more Socratic systems. It’s
probably very difﬁcult to simulate
this give—and~take method through
a computer screen.

But the second reason for resis-
tance is that universities stand to
lose much from real online learn-
ing, as it threatens their monopoly
on certiﬁcation. Currently, students
are forced to fork out increasingly
exorbitant amounts of money for
an employment—worthy education
—— a few online classes don’t make
the cut, yet. But if online schools
gain legitimacy, and it’s shown that
they can impart the same education
as massively expensive brick-and-
mortar universities, many students
will make the economic choice.

Already, there are signs of uni-
versities’ reluctance. After the ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence class, Stanford
wasn’t interested in further devel-
oping the idea. And in a 2010 Cam-
pus Computing survey, 75 percent of
respondents said faculty resistance
impeded online education.

As is almost always the case,
the most efficient option will likely
win — just as, despite the protests
of many farmers and steel work-
ers, American industry advanced,
and everybody’s quality of life im-
proved. For the sake of student and
government pocketbooks, we can
only hope education moves forward
as well.

SPORTS  

THROWING A KIRSCHBALL

Pitt looks to build confidence with win

Byjasper Wilson
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will look to ﬁnd its conﬁdence and
end an eight—game losing streak
when it travels to Marquette on
Saturday.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
said a dip in her team’s conﬁdence
was inevitable.

“I think that’s natural. I think
that’s normal,” she said. “We’re
all competitors. Does [the losing
streak] play games with you psy-
chologically, physically and men-
tally? I think it absolutely does.”

Marquette (12-10, 3-6 Big East)
is the third youngest team in the
nation. Pitt (8-14, 0-9 Big East) is
the ﬁrst, with no seniors and just
one junior on the roster.

The Golden Eagles are in the
midst of their own losing skid and
have lost four games in a row.

Pitt and Marquette also both

‘ struggle with offensive production

and maintaining possession.

Marquette’s Katherine Plouffe is
the only member of the team who
averages double ﬁgures, with 13.8
points per game. An All—Big East
freshman last year, the forward
also leads the team in rebounds
and steals.

Brianna Kiesel and Ashlee An-
derson are the only Panthers av-

eraging double ﬁgures with 12.9
and 10.1 points per game, respec-
tively.

The Golden Eagles average 21.1
turnovers per game — the most in
the Big East. Pitt turns the ball over
19.8 times per game.

Berenato said the shared weak-
ness isn’t a surprise.

“It’s a sign of two young teams,”
she said.

As a post player, Pitt redshirt
sophomore Leeza Burdgess isn’t
usually a distributor, but she still
has a vital role to play if the team is
going to reduce its turnovers.

She said she needs to come
to the ball, so the guards aren’t
cautious about passing the ball
inside.

“Anything I can do to help us
keep the possession, if that means

NBA GOLUMN

Western Conference

By Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

With the shortened NBA season
nearly one—third of the way over,
it’s time to take a look at the ﬁrst
month inreview. ’

The 66-game NBA season has '

provided plenty of basketball
action already, with most teams
playing between three and ﬁve
games per week.

The effects of the lockout have

I already become apparent. The

Elias Sports Bureau, a website that
provides historical research and
statistics, said that teams" aver-
aged only 94.2 points per game
injanuary, the lowest for a single
month since March of 2004.
However, the scoring drop

4 hasn’t affected every team. The

Denver Nuggets, Miami Heat and
Oklahoma City Thunder all aver-
age over 100 points per game.

On a related note, all three
teams own some of the best re-
cords in their respective confer-
ences. ‘

The 14-7 Nuggets sit in third

place overall in the Western
Conference and trail their divi-
sion mate Oklahoma City, which
owns a conference-best record
of 16-4. .

In the East, the Heat currently
own second place in the confer-
ence with a 16-5 record and only
trail the conference-leading Chi-
cago Bulls by one game in the
standings.

Although scoring was low for
the ﬁrst full month of the season,
fans no doubt witnessed an im-
provement in the quality of play
throughoutjanuary. As players get
back into shape and become more
comfortable with their coaches
and their teammates, the level
of competition will continue to
rise. 1

As for the Eastern Conference,
competition will be heated for
the lower seeds in the playoffs.
The Cleveland Cavaliers, one of
the surprise teams that I men-
tioned earlier this season, ﬁnd
themselves a single game out of
the No. 8 seed in the conference.

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Syracuseleads, Pitt jumps in rankings

By R] Sepich
Staff Writer

This season’s Pitt men’s basket-
ball team reminds me of the in-
famous words from Will Ferrell’s
character, Frank the Tank, in the
movie “Old School”: We’re going
streaking.

But when the Panthers go
streaking, it comes in the form of
wins and losses.

A nine-game winning streak
helped head coach Jamie Dixon’s
team get to an 11-1 start this sea-
son, but a shocking home loss to
Wagner over the holidays started
an eight—game losing streak that
left many people claiming that the
season couldn’t be salvaged.

But with starting junior point
guard Travon Woodall finally
healthy, the Panthers ended their
losing skid against Providence and
followed that win with upset vic-
tories over No. 9 Georgetown and
at West Virginia.

The three-game Winning streak
has Pitt back to 3-7 in Big East
play and bumps it up six spots
tp ninth in this week’s Big East
Breakdown.

So with the Panthers quickly
gaining ground on the rest of the
Big East, here are my weekly rank-
ings of all 16 teams in the crowded
basketball conference:

1. Syracuse — With star sopho-
more center Fab Melo out with
academic issues, the Orange (22-1,
9-1 Big East) barely escaped with
a controversial two-point win
against West Virginia last Satur-
day. A missed goaltending call
allowed Syracuse to pick up that
victory. Luckily for the Orange,
Melo is set to return this week for
a trip across New Yorkto face St.
John’s and a home matchup with
Georgetown.

2. Marquette — The Golden Ea-
gles (19-4, 8-2 Big East) are on an
impressive winning streak of their
own as victories over Villanova
and Seton Hall this week stretched
’Marquette’s streak to seven con-
secutive games. Head coach Buzz
Williams’ team suffered its only Big
East losses early in the campaign
at Georgetown and Syracuse. If the
Golden Eagles can survive a road
test at Notre Dame this Saturday,
their winning streak could soon
reach double‘-digits.

3. Georgetown —- As possibly

the conference’s most fundamen-
tally sound and consistent team,
the Hoyas (17-4, 7-3 Big East)
continue to surprise. Georgetown
followed a loss at Pitt with an im-
pressive defensive performance
at home against Connecticut on
Wednesday. The Hoyas held the
Huskies to just 44 points. That win
—— along with another home game
versus South Florida on Saturday
— will be the perfect prepara-
tion for the Hoyas’ road challenge
against Syracuse next week.

But when the C
Panthers go
streaking, it
comes in the
form ofwins
  and losses.  

4. Notre Dame — The Fight-
ing Irish (14-8, 6-3 Big East) are
also hitting their stride, which is
surprising considering that Notre
Dame has spent the better part
of this season without injured
leading scorer Tim Abromaitis.

Following their upset of then-No. ~

1 Syracuse, the Irish carried the
momentum to two road victories
at Seton Hall and Connecticut.
This Saturday’s matchup between
Marquette and Notre Dame pits
the Big East’s two hottest teams
against each other.

5. Louisville — The Cardinals
(17-5, 5-4 Big East) are ﬁnally
healthy and have started living
up to preseason expectations that
had them in the_top 10 of every
national poll. After beginning con-
ference play 2-4, Louisville has
rallied to win three straight games
and appears to be peaking at‘ the

perfect time. With a starting lineup
consisting of ﬁve players who can
explode offensively at any time, it
was only a matter of time before
the Cardinals got back on track.

6. Cincinnati — I don’t know
what to make of the Bearcats (15-
7, 5-4 Big East). As the only team
in the Big East anywhere near as
streaky as Pitt, it’s tough to judge
what this group is capable of.
Wins against Pitt, Notre Dame and
Georgetown will certainly help
Cincinnati’s resume come Selec-
tion Sunday, but the puzzling loss-
es to St. john’s and Rutgers hurt
their credentials. I’m extremely
curious to watch how the Bearcats
play down the stretch.

7. South Florida — On the other
hand, the Bulls (13-9, 6-3 Big East)
are the conference’s most pre-
dictable team. In its nine Big East
games, South Florida — without
fail —— has won the games it should
have won and lost the games it
should have lost. The schedule
has been kind to the Bulls so far,
but it will become tougher in the
coming weeks. If South Florida can
ﬁnish around .500 in the Big East,
this season should be considered a
huge success for the Bulls.

8. West Virginia -— The Moun-
taineers (15-8, 5-5 Big East) are in
danger of a collapse. Some rough
luck at Syracuse and lackluster
performances against St. John’s
and Pitt have put Coach Bob Hug-
gins’ team on a three-game losing
streak, and the upcoming schedule
doesn’t bode well for WVU. Senior
forward Kevinjones might be the
Big East’s best player, but if his
teammates don’t start helping
him out soon, the Mountaineers
will continue to head in the wrong
direction.

As for the rest of the Big East,
Pitt (9) is a team trending up-
wards, while Connecticut (10)
and Seton Hall (11) both need
to immediately end their losing
streaks before they get sucked
too far down in the league stand-
ings. St. john’s (12) and Rutgers
(13) continue to trudge along as
bottom-tier teams, doing the best
they can during rebuilding years.
Finally, all isn’t lost for Villanova
(14), DePaul (15) and Providence
(16), but these teams need to start
putting wins together quickly if
they plan on playing postseason
basketball. I

' over a cheerleader or something, I’ll do it,”

she said. 

Pitt sophomore guard Marquel Davis said
the -team needs to have more conﬁdence in
possession.

“If the team is just more conﬁdent when
they have the ball, in their handle  then we
won’t have those turnovers that [make it]
appear that.we’re not good ball handlers,”
Davis said.

In the team’s last game against St.john’s,
Pitt turned the ball over 26 times, tying its
season high.

Sophomore guard Asia Logan, who in-
jured her shoulder against St.john’s, is con-
sidered day to day.

The Panthers need a player or a few to
step up offensively to ﬁll the void left by

Berenato said that forwards Kyra Dunn,
TiAnna Porter and Chyna Golden will all
continue to rotate through, whether or not
Asia plays Saturday.

The Panthers appeared to have solved
their scoring problems in the ﬁrst half
against St. john’s, shooting 50 percent, but
then relapsed in the second half and shot
just 30 percent.

Davis linked the team’s offensive struggles
to a shared lack of conﬁdence.

“You have to continuously be positive
throughout the whole game,” she said. “A lot
of times if somebody does make a mistake in
their heads, they’re thinking, ‘Shoot, I just
did that,’ instead of, ‘It’s cool, I’m gonna get
it right back on D.’ It has to be a constant
reminder  To keep conﬁdence you have
to keep positively reinforcing that you_ got
it.”

To Berenato, a lack of conﬁdence doesn’t
mean it’s time to sound the alarm.

“For us, we’re not atfhat point where

until mid-April, the team shows promise.

In the East, six playoff spots look like
locks. The Bulls, Heat,-Hawks, Sixers, Pac-
ers and Magic will all be in the postseason.
The last two spots are up for grabs.

I left out one major name: the Boston
Celtics.

The Celtics ﬁnally managed to even their
record at 10-10, but I don’t think they’ll
manage to make the postseason. I expect
general manager Danny Ainge to fully dis~
mantle this team. The Celtics won as much
as they could. Now, they have to get rid of
old players like Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and
Kevin Garnett while they still have some
value.

Ainge’s expected actions at this year’s
trading deadline are the main reasons the
Celtics will miss the playoffs for the ﬁrst
time since Allen, Pierce and Garnett have
all been playing on the team together.

The Knicks are also disappointing their
fans. New York is playing poorly and the
team is dropping in the standings. At 8-13,
the Knicks trail the Cavaliers by half a game
in the loss column.

In the Western Conference, the play is
as competitive as usual. Fans might see a
team from the West miss the playoffs with
a better record than the ﬁfth or sixth seed
in the East.

The Portland Trail Blazers, who started
the season hot, cooled off and now own a
record of 12-9, making them the No. 9 team
in the Western Conference. Meanwhile,
the Magic —— with an identical record to
Portland —— currently own the No. 6 seed
in the East.

Any team in the Northwest Division
will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to make the playoffs.
Every team could make the postseason,

I think the Clippers, Lakers, Thunder, jazz
and even the Trail Blazers will deﬁnitely

. qualify for the postseason.

Here are my predictions for the rest of
the season:

1. Miami Heat —— Southeast Division

2. Chicago Bulls .— Central Division

3. Indiana Pacers
4. Philadelphia 76ers — Atlantic Divi-

Here’s a game to check out on national
television this week: ‘

Los Angeles Lakers at Denver Nuggets
(Friday, Feb. 3 at10:3O p.m. — ESPN)

Two Western Conference foes square
off in a matchup that could help determine
playoff seeding. The teams split their ﬁrst
meetings and the Nuggets will want to break
the tie and put themselves on top. Kobe
Bryant, who’s been playing well recently,
will lead his team into one of the toughest
arenas in professional sports. The Lakers,
who don’t play well on the road, will face a
difficult challenge against the Nuggets. ﬂ

on Nov. 11. The second loss came with
a less-than-healthy Woodall at Notre
Dame on Dec. 27, followed by a loss in
Woodall’s first game back against Lou-
isville.

In the 11 games without Woodall on
the floor, the Panthers averaged 66.2
points per game and shot 42.8 percent.
In the 12 games with Woodall, Pitt aver-
aged 76.3 points per game and shot 49.4
percent from the floor.

Woodall’s impact can’t be measured
completely in numbers. The reinstate-
ment ofthe Panthers’ point guard means
that his teammates can return to their
natural.positions, allowing the offense
to run more smoothly.

..“A point guard is important,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said after Pitt’s
win over West Virginia. “It allows guys

to play other spots. It gets guys less '

minutes. I don’t feel guys are out there
playing too many minutes. I don’t feel
like they’re playing out of position.
We’re feeling more comfortable. We’re

_ getting better.”

Of course, Pitt’s ‘past struggles won’t
be disregarded just because Woodall
couldn’t play. The Panthers’ strength of
schedule is 20th in the country, but Pitt
has some bad losses on the record.

The losses toALong Beach State and

Wagner aren’t as bad as they seem —
the teams are 34th and 77th in the RPI,
respectively — but the fact that the
defeats came at home doesn’t help Pitt’s
case.

According to the RPI, the Panthers’
worst losses came at DePaul (159) and
at home against Rutgers (135). Pitt also
lacks an impressive nonconference vic-
tory.

But before any of those numbers mat-
ter, the Panthers have to finish out the
season strong and avoid any more bad
losses or home losses. Currently, Pitt
is still 3-7 in the Big East, and while
NCAA Tournament talk has picked up
again locally and nationally, the Pan-
thers still have a long way to go to reach
the bubble.

The quest for a bid starts on Sunday
when the Panthers face Villanova at
home. The Wildcats — who started the
season receiving votes in both national
polls and were picked to finish eighth in
the Big East.,—- have also plummeted to
the bottom ofthe conference standings

' this season.

Villanova is 10-12 and 3-7 in the Big
East coming off two consecutive losses
to Marquette and Louisville. The Wild-
cats’ only Big East wins came against
DePaul, Seton Hall and St. john’s, who
hold conference records of2-7, 4-6 and
4-6, respectively.

The matchup with Villanova is a game
that the_Panthers should —— and must
—— win. ﬂ '
