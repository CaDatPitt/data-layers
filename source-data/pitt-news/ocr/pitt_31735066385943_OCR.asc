Agent Orange component used in pesticides

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

An environmental audit,
conducted by the campus
organization Concerned Leaders
for Environmental Action Now,
has revealed that a component
of Agent Orange is used to treat
some of the campus lawn areas.

The chemical 2,4-D, an
herbicide used to kill broad-
leaved weeds, is currently under
investigation ‘by the
Environmental Protection
Agency. According to Laura
Curtis, a spokeswoman for
CLEAN, the agency is deciding
whether or not 2,4-D should be

A discontinued on the market.

The audit reported that the
University of Pittsburgh uses 2,4-
D mixed with fertilizer in a
concentration of 2.75 pounds for
every 50 pounds of fertilizer. The
first application takes place

‘ generally in April or May, and a

second fertilization is applied in

June or July. The Cathedral of

Learning lawn is one of the several

areas on campus sprayed with
the chemical.

In Pennsylvania, a number of
environmental
lobbied to ban 2,4-D, according
to the audit. The audit reveals
that laboratory studies have linked
2,4-D to a wide range of
teratogenic and mutagenic effects.
As a direct consequence of these
studies, the American Cancer
Association has determined 2,4-
D to be carcinogenic. The audit
reports that the National Cancer
Institute has established a possible
link between 2,4-D and non-
Hodgkins lymphoma — a type of
lymph cancer. A

“The use of 2,4-D is very
controversial,” said Curtis. “Why
should students have to wait for
the EPA to ban the product when
students lie on the Cathedral lawn?
When I started working on the
audit project, I didn’t think the
results were going to be as bad as
they were.”

According to the audit, the
university does not post warnings
before and after it sprays

groups have '

herbicides and pesticides. The
current argument against posting
is that any student is free to
obtain the information through
the school. Records of outdoor
herbicide and pesticide
applications are kept by the
university. However, according
to the report, these records are
essentially unavailable to the
university community as their
existence is kept quiet, and access
to staff is difficult.

The audit was conducted in
conjunction with the 20th annual
Earth Day celebration, which will
be observed worldwide on April
22. The first Earth Day took place
in 1970. Its organizers stressed
the fragility of the environment
and encouraged people to
preserve nature.

Curtis said that pesticide use is
not confined to the outdoors and
is regularly sprayed in campus
buildings. The audit reports that
virtually all of the treatment for
cockroaches on campus involves
two chemicals, Ficam and
Dursban, also likely candidates

for removal from EPA registration.
Both Dursban and Ficam can
affect the central nervous system,
producing such symptoms as
headaches, vertigo, drowsiness,
twitching muscles or mental
confusion. Long-terrn damage can
also occur, according to the audit.

“Dursban and Ficam are very
toxic in the short term, and it
takes large quantities for lethal
effects,» but they breakdown
quickly," said Curtis. “However,
since university buildings are
sprayed frequently, there is the
possibility for long-terrn chronic
effects of the chemicals, according
to the EPA and the Department of
Agriculture. The chemicals can
weaken the immune system and
make people prone to colds and
other viral infections.”

The audit reports that one of
the most shocking aspects of the
study is the magnitude of indoor
spraying which takes place on
campus. Ten buildings are treated
on a bimonthly basis. Five are
treated on a weekly basis,
including the Schenley Cafe.

-Of course, the panther brings to mind football, which
had its moments. The football team, along with new
Coach Paul Hackett, made it to the John Hancock Bowl
and won. Mike Gottfried couldn’t make the trip to
Arizona, just as the Pitt band couldn’t make the trip to

Ireland —— but for different reasons.

Football is a rough and.toug/h game, whichleads us to

I consider a rather disturbing statistic for Pitt last year: the
‘.13-percent increase in campus crime.” It’s ironic that the

news about the crime increase came out around the same
time that the story about the cancellation of Pitt’s self-
defense course. The self—defense course was very popu-

-lar with students, but so was Jay McKenzie’s University

Shop with Pitt alumni. Oh well, we guess there really is
something to be said forthat old phrase, “All good things

smust come to 'an'end;”f But must they?  “ v ’

Yes, there was a lot to like about the last school year.

9 The Chautauqua Conference was a tremendous success,

and it was a true honor for Pitt to host it. We may be on
the verge, of a more prudent, tougher’ Student Govern-
ment Board. Pitt’s ‘medical school received some long-

due praise by US. News and World Report; it was ranked , '
the fourth-best medical school in the country. And Pitt

added a new Nationality Room. I

But yes, there wasalso a lot to dislike about the 1989-
90 school year. South Oakland residents grieved over the
apartments they lived in. The battle over the change in the
graduation date was more than festive. Pitt President
Wesley Posvar contended ROTC was an “outside organi-
zation” and could discriminate against gay and lesbian
people, despite Pitt’s anti—discrirnination policy, suppos-
edly forbidding them from doing so. And finally, the
administration found itself in a cryogenic state over the

hiring freeze and waging a battle over tax-exempt status

‘for the university. ‘

On the subject of the hiring freeze, Pitt once again
solidified to its students where its priorities lied, and once
again, it’s the humanities that suffer. In the English
Department, L. David Harris was relieved of his duties as
one of Pitt’s most dedicated and knowledgable journal-
ism instructors. When Posvar announced his hiring
freeze, he noted that when high—caliber instructors come
along, they will be given the utmost consideration. But
Harris, former chairman of Point Park College’s writing
department and one of the few full-time non—fiction
faculty members in the department, was not retained

. because the university feels that publishing only counts

when it appears in a bound volume and not on news-
print. As l.ong as the undergraduates continue to foot the
bill to keep the laboratories and business schools open,
we can at least demand that our administration retain the
professors, like Harris, who make a difference.
See ya next year.

Cutting TC is not the solution

We feel it is necessary to re-

spond to the issue of removing
[the Reserve Ofﬁcer’s Training
Corps] from the Pitt? campus.
We recognizethat ROTC pro-
vides many benefits to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh community
and to the nation as a whole.
ROTC presents valuable educa-

V tional opportunities to the stu-
dent body. Second, ROTC schol— ‘

arships enable students, who
would otherwise be unable to
afford higher, education, to at-

; tertdiour university. Third, his-

tory shows strong national lead-
ers have emerged-from the *'Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps
program in the colleges and
universities across the United
States. For example, the current
chairman of the joint Chiefs of
Staff, Colin Powell, is a product
of - the ROTC program.

Although this is not an attack
on BiGALA or the gay commu-
nity, we believe that the integrity
of the ROTC must be maintained.

Thoughts

As the 1989-90 academic year
at the University of Pittsburgh
draws to a close, I ﬁnd myself
reﬂecting upon my experiences
as a first—year writer for The Pitt
News.

I came to Pitt as a so-called

“hotshot" journalist and writer in -

high school. I planned to con-
tinue these ways, so I entered
The Pitt News office as an eager
but conﬁdent freshman in Sep-
tember. It was a whole new world
from anything that I had ever
been exposed to before.

Isoon realized, with the help
of a couple of veteran editors,
that I was simply a freshman with
little or no valuable experience. I
was initially.discouraged, until I
saw the errors of my approach. I
was trying too hard to be too
professional.

Granted, the newspaper is a
“liberal” newspaper, but although
professionalism is necessary, I
was too strict about it. I found a
niche of the newspaper where I
was most comfortable: the per-
spective section. I am a very
opinionated person, and this was

In conclusion, we support
President Posvar’s position, on
this issue. While recognizing the
university's anti-discrirnination
policy, removing the ROTC pro-

, gram from campus is not a viable

solution. .

So I wrote, and my profession-

with both my writing and the

THE PI'l'I' NEWS, Thursday, April 19, 1990

Now what?

My career as a columnist for
The Pitt News is about to draw to
an end. At midnight, my com-
puter will turn into head cheese
and my suit and tie will turn into
a T-shirt and jeans.

As one of the many seniors in
Pitt’s graduating class, I'll be
receiving a piece of paper which
somehow implies that I'm ready
for work in the outside world.
Am I? Who knows? I’ve decided
to duck into graduate school to
delay the answer to that ultimate
question. _

Since I’m a transfer student,
I’ve only been at Pitt for two
years. During that time, I’ve tried
to acclimate myself to the cam-
pus as fast and as well as pos-
sible. One way to do this was to
pen for The Pitt News.

In the lineup of conservative
columnists for The Pitt News I’ve
batted cleanup, writing more for
power than for accolades and

awards. I’ve probably struck out

just as often as I’ve struck nerves.
God knows my column has
probably lined more trash cans
than has graced bulletin boards.
But hell, it’s been enjoyable.
On Tuesday, Paul Kengor listed
a few words that the liberals toss
around without knowing their
full or true deﬁnition: racist, fas-
cist, homophobe, etc. I’ve been
labeled with all of these words
by people whose knowledge of
my personality is to the extent of
a 25-inch column. When I leave
Pitt, I’ll be abandoning a stack of
hate mail, a bullet-holed window
and a frazzled reading audience.
Last year, it was my pro-life col-
umn which corralled the angst of
the left; this year itwas my call for

' straight rights which riled up the

heterophobes at BiGALA.

I’ve probably received more
letters from angry liberals (does
that still mean open-minded?)
than I have from old friends. lt’s
not easy being a conservative,
but it sure beats protesting. Col-

umnist George Will once said
that conservatives must compen-

    

Mario
Oliverio

sate for a lack of compassion by
thinking rationally. -Sometimes
Will’s tie is too tight. Conserva-
tives do show compassion,
compassion for the Contras, the
people of Eastern Europe, the
unborn, the victims of murder-

ers, and big business.

Time magazine featured a story
a few weeks ago which, in effect,
stated that withthe fall of com-
munism in the East, conserva-
tives won’t have an evil bugbear
to rally around, causing an inter-
nal collapse within the Republi-
can Party. This is another sloppy
analysis on the scale of proclaim-
ing Gorbachev Man of the Dec-
ade.

Internationally, the world is still
full of a rogues’ gallery of crazed
unpredictables —— the PLO and
Khadafi, to name a few. Cuba is
another story. With the rise of
democracy in Nicaragua, Cuba is
now more isolated than ever in
the western hemisphere. Cries,
no doubt, will soon go out as
“Let’s Get Castro!” This would be
a. mistake. Cuba should be al-
lowed, nay, forced to remain
socialist. It could be turned into a
ﬂoating museum piece of Marxist
ideology. And when Castro and
his goons die, we should mum-

mify them and turn Havana into

“Daddy, can I touch them?”

“Better not, son. They crumble

But I'm digressing. This - is
supposed to be my farewell col-
umn. I'm supposed to be ingrati-
ating and not use this space to
take parting shots at the ideologi-
cally aimless.

One ﬁnal thing that I must
admit, to my chagrin, is since
coming to Pitt, I’ve become more
liberal. I no longer toast Oliver
North at the breakfast table, I’ve

ceased havingstomach cramps ‘
at the sound of child—care legisla- I

Special thanks to my friends and Pitt's 'enlightened'

Although I had no intention of
drinking on Easter and I had a
term paper to do, I accidentally
had a few beers last Sunday. I say
accidentally because I happened
to run into an old friend who will
be graduating this month, and
we ended up laughing about a
lot of old times that happened
two years ago.

This has been I a- common
occurrence this spring, with
graduation inJune looming over
my head. I have spent a lot of
time thinking about the last four
years and seem to be having a lot
of remember-when-we and what-
will-you-be-doing conversations
with almost everyone I run into.

I originally was against writing
a farewell column for two rea-
sons. For one thing, I may write
for the first half of the summer.
For another thing, farewell col-
umns are usually hazardous to
people with low insulin, and
diabetes runs in my family.
However, since “What are you
doing after graduation?” has
replaced “What’s your major?” as
the all-purpose trite conversa-
tion piece, even the most cynical
are getting misty, which is part of
what makes this time of the year
so loathsome.

Anyway, I decided to take the
time to thank those who made

these four years interesting, in-

Police do more than just drink coffee and eat donuts

Recently, there have been
several criminal incidents at Car-
negie Mellon University. As
reported in The Pittsburgh Press,
CMU student James Salsman was
accosted on the 5300 block of
Forbes Avenue at 1:30 a.m. on
Thursday, April 5. He was beaten,
sliced with a knife several times
and robbed. Fortunately, he was
able to escape from his three
assailants. At 2:30 p.m. the very

Well, I am particularly con-
cerned with the latest violent
crimes in Pittsburgh because, like
much of the Pitt population, I
have some good friends at CMU.

I think enough Pitt students spend '

enough time at CMU for these
crimes to warrant our attention.
The question is, should we
worry? The attacks did not occur
on Pitt’s campus, but that does
not necessarily mean we are safe.
CMU is just a short walk up the
avenue. On the other hand, the
other students at CMU aren't
knocking themselves out over
this. Isuppose it’s a relative matter.

ever seen reported are the obliga-
tory drunken brawls on Forbes

Filipino student struck by tall Americans, fast food

(Editor's note: 7731: is tbeﬁnal
tn the series proﬁling the

experiences of international

students who attend the University
of Pittsburgh . )

By Pria Bhargava
Staff Writer

Wearing a khaki sweatshirt, a
gold chain and a gold bracelet,
Publio Briones sits behind his

V‘ desk in the. Pitt International
‘ . StudentOrganization office, going

overhis mail. After looking over

  the last letter on his "desk, he
  .:begins to -talk-about his home.‘

79 i -I .~Brion;esi_ is ~" -from Cebu", -
 »‘fPhilipp’i“nes, —— «[the ,_country’s'4

second-l’argest'” city}  and,

according to Briones, the most
beautiful- His very independent

life there was starkly different
from the one here. “I went to the
Polo Club after school, then
watched TV and went to the
beach. I got things done for me,”
he said. A

He went to Switzerland for
high school, but because he
“goofed around,” his father
wouldn’t allow him to go to
college there. He found out about
Pitt through a bicentennial
pamphlet that his uncle brought

j him. -

‘One of his first impressions

upon arriving here was the height _
of most Americans. “They are so 1‘

ta1l!_'’‘ he said. ' y , A ,
Hewas ‘also struck by the food.

“I do not like hamburgers, though,

if I’m really desperate, I goto
McDonald’s because it’s the
cheapest food I can find.” He

._ he is very‘ grateful.

would give anything for some

' ‘-Filipino food.

"Briones also discovered that
money and work are necessary,
and consequently, he began
working in an art gallery three
times a week.

When placed in the
International Living Unit upon
his arrival at Pitt, he had a few
qualms because he was afraidof
being limited only to meeting
foreigners rather'thanAmericans.
However," he subsequently
became very attached to the unit,
and the ‘experience led to his
involvement with PISO, for which

\

 "_ His plans for the__ o”r‘ga'nieation

include recruiting more

Americans: “IPISO] is not just for
international students.” Briones

encourages all to attend PISO
meetings, which are held on
Friday nights on the seventh floor
of the William Pitt Union.

Briones has just joined a new
fraternity, which he is excited
about because it gives him the
opportunity to meet many people.
He is surprised at the openness
and frankness he has found in
the Americans he has met. “Not
that being frank is bad, but in my
country, people will stare at you

if you say whatever is on your.

mind.”

He vwants his children to have
Filipino values, particularly
respect for elders. "f“Here,- you
have children talking back: and

forth. In rnycountry-, you don’t I

do that  at least I haven’t been

' brought up like that, and I don’t

want my kids to be brought up
like that.” ' ,

Briones feels certain that he
would like his future children to
be brought up in the manner that
he was, with the added benefit of
an extended family and a Filipino
environment.

“I'm not saying that if I brought
up kids here, they wouldn’t have
respect for elders, but what I’m
saying is that this is an‘ open
society, and it took me some time
to get used to it.” '

' Since Brion_es'has a _student
visa, his stay_is not permanent,

~ ?but he does not seem to have any

regrets. “I want to die in my own
country,” he said.

The bird a1muaAl itt News T eam

 

Alex Van Pelt, Brian Shorter, and Connie Hurt were three of this year's top vote getters in the annual All Pitt News Team poll.

Brian Shorter

Shorter once again proved to
be one of the premier inside men
in collegiate basketball as he
posted up .a season average of
20.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per
game. He also earned Big East
All-Conference honors this year.

Lorri Johnson

Johnson averaged 20.3 points
and 8.1 rebounds per game and
was the most recent recipient of
the women’s Panther Award, an
honor which goes to the senior
athlete who has demonstrated
outstanding athletic achievement
throughout her career at the
university. Her name will be
engraved on the Varsity Walk

, between the Cathedral of Learning

and Heinz Chapel in recognition
of her achievememts.

Making her accomplishments
even more impressive is the fact
thatjohnson underwent two knee
operations. She rebounded from
the surgery to become one of the
most effective players ever for
the Lady Panthers.

Connie Hurt

Hurt earned third-team Big East
All-Conference honors this year
while proving to be an integral
part of the Lady Panther basketball
team along with Lorri Johnson.

Hurt averaged 14.8 points and
6.6 rebounds per game.

Curvin Richards
Richards jumped into fourth

place on Pitt’s all-time career A

rushing list with his second
consecutive 1,000-yard season.
Last season he ran for 1,282 yards,
up from 1,228 in his freshman

' season. Only Tony Dorsett, Craig

Heyward and Elliot Walker rank
ahead ‘of Richards in career

Alex Van Pelt

. In just his freshman year at Pitt,
Van Pelt set a school record for
season-passing yardage with
2,881. Dan Marino held the
previous record of 2,876 yards.
Marino threw for 1,680 yards as a
freshman. With only his freshman
year behind him, Van Pelt is
already sixth on Pitt’s career-
passing list.

Van Pelt was named to the
second team Associated Press All-
East team, and the The Sporting
News put him on the freshman
honor roll.

Mike Kozlina

Kozlina won outstanding
swimmer two years in a row in
the Big East Conference. He was
runner-u p at the Eastern Seaboard
Championships behind an
Olympian. '

Julie Sheils

Julie Sheils concluded her
volleyball career at Pitt in fine
fashion. As the hardest hitter on
the Lady Panther team, she was
named to the Big East All-
Tournament team. She was an
integral, part of the Pitt volleyball
team that repeated as Big East
champions and went 32-10
overall.

um prrr NEWS, Thursday, April 19, 1990

I am proud to say that I am a
diehard New York Mets fan. I
remember the ribbing I got when
the Mets were perennial losers
and the pride I felt when they

won the World Series. But in ‘

Pittsburgh, instead of being able

1 A to bask in my team’s success, I

have to listen to an endless barrage
of “Met-bashing.”

Yunz guys know what Met-
bashing is. Ifyou don't, just pick
up a newspaper or listen to a
sports report on the news this
season.

It is as important to sports fans
in Pittsburgh when the Mets lose
as it is when the Pirates win,
regardless of whether either team
is in the pennant race. I never
have to look in a newspaper to
find out how the Mets did because
every morning my friends let me
know. Silence means that they
won; constant badgering means

that they lost.

I think the Pirates are a very
good team. They have the talent
to be a contender if they get
lucky and get career seasons from
their star players like they did in
1988. But every chance they get,
many Pirate fans take cheap shots
at the Mets. Even Pirate shortstop
Jay Bell called the Mets “pond
scum” on Piztsburgbis Talking,
with that stunning Ann Devlin
and all her teeth.

Met—bashers call Darryl
Strawberry many nasty names
that I, as a true fan, will not
repeat. But some of the most
popular comments are “He sucks”
or “I hate him” or the very creative,
“I hate him; he sucks!” My
question is why? With last year as
an exception, he has been a
productive player for the Mets,
and I doubt that if he were a
Pirate, fans would “hate him.” So

.It's no fun being a NY. Mets fan

what if he is a trouble—maker, an
underachiever, and has a big
mouth? Humm  sounds a lot

Jim
Lakely

like Barry Bonds.

Dwight Gooden is one of the
premier pitchers in the game
today. With success coming to
him at such an early age, he fell

to the evil temptation of cocaine. 2

While drug abuse is no trivial
matter, he has admirably battled
his drug problem to put his life
and career back into order.

Yet with Met-bashers, his name

“The bum should go to jail,” a
friend once told me. “Well,” I'd
say, “remember the drug trial in
Pittsburgh involving many former
Pirate players including Dave
Parker and Dale Berra?" Mention
of that little scandal usually shuts
up the average Met—basher for a
while.

The bottom line is that the Mets
have good reason to be arrogant.
They have earned it by building
a winning franchise with a strong
farm system and smart trades.
Throw in the New York press,
and you get a bunch of likeable
buttheads who can really play

The Buccos are a scrappy

But as Andy Van Slyke said,
“Nice tries don't win pennants.”
The Pirates need a competent
front office and one more impact

‘player to be more than just a

spoiler to the real contenders in
the National League. If this ever
happens, I’m sure that the heads
(and wallets) of their star players
will be just as big as the/Mets’.

Until then, Met-bashers, pick
on someone your own size (like
the Phillies). Hey, the Mets aren’t
the only team in the NL East.

worrying about the Cubs.

Most people have an opinion
on the legality of abortion, an
issue important in many recent
political campaigns, as well as in
the mass trial of protestors taking
place downtown. It’s about time
that the majority of Americans,
who support a woman’s right to
a safe and legal abortion, stood
up and said so.

Over 200,000 people took part
in a pro-choice rally earlier this
year in Washington, D.C., but
Pittsburgh has been relatively
quiet —— at least until this Sunday,
when the Chatham Coffeehouse
and Women's Issues Group
present a pro-choice concert,
appropriately titled Rock For
Choice.

The proceeds from the event
benefit both the continuous
lobbying efforts of the National
Abortion Rights Action League
and the Vivian Campbell Fund,
which provides free abortion
services and other health care at
Women's Health Services,
downtown.

Representatives of various local
activist groups, especially those
involved with abortion and other

rwomen’s-rights issues, will be on

hand to supply information about
their activities

THE PITI‘ NEWS,Thursday, April 19, 1990

Rockfor Choice =

 

So who’s playing? No rinky-
dink hippie bands, that’s for sure.
Instead, audience members will
be treated to four national acts
from Ohio along with a local
band, the Pleasureheads.

The headliners are Scrawl, the
all-female trio from Columbus
who have just released their third
LP, Smallmoutb, and Cincinnati’s
hard-rocking Afghan Whigs, who
have a record coming out shortly
on Sub Pop.

Cleveland's whirlwind of
churning sound, commonly
referred to as the Vivians will
open the show, as well as punkers
Sister Ray from Youngstown, who
are rather unknown in the States
but huge in Europe -— they have
three LPs on the Dutch label
Resonance Records.

Altogether, Rock For Choice
promises to be one huge night of
great music for an important
cause, a woman’s right to control
her own body. Don’t blow it,
cheese.

Rocle For Choice talees place on
Sunday, April 29 at 9 pm. in the
Chatham College Dining Hall. All
ages are welcome, and admission
is $5. ’

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 19, 1990 _

 

By Jenna Ferrara
The Pitt News

The day of her husband’s
funeral is obscenely glorious for
Bernarda Alba: Now she has
unlimited power. Bernarda, a
matriarch of a prominent Spanish
family, swiftly imposes an eight-
year period of mourning on her
live unmarried daughters, who
range in age from 20 to 39,
forbidding them from leaving the
house, lest they shame the family
and their village with their
irreverence.

With her family securely (or so
she thinks) under her withered
thumb, Bernarda arranges a
marriage between Pepe el
Romano, the most handsome
young man in town, and
Angustias, her oldest (and ugliest)
daughter. This unlikely match

A becomes even more ill-fated

when Angustias’ sisters Martirio
and Adela, who are both fiercely
in love with Pepe, vehemently
oppose this union, with Adela
defying both her mother and her

culture by becoming Pepe’s lover.
The play ends in disaster when a
livid Bernarda discovers Adela’s
transgressions, and Bernarda’s
compulsion to control ends in
death. (I won’t say whose.)
Rina Yerushalmi, director of
this Carnegie Mellon University
production of Federico Garcia
Lorca’s The House of Bemarda
Alba, creates a stunning vision of
a social structure which
suppresses human emotion and
sexuality. Yerushalmi, a visiting
professor with a voluminous list
of impressive credits from Israel
and New York City, adeptly allows
the underlying hatreds among
the characters to emerge.
I have heard criticism, however,
that Yerushalmi takes too many
unwarranted liberties with Garcia
Lorca’s script. For instance, Adela
is supposed to break her mother’s
cane in half at the end of the play,
an action which , symbolizes
Bernarda’s impotence. In.
Yerushalmi’s production, Adela
.merely wrests the cane from her
mother’s hands —— a choice that

possibly ignores the importance
of the image that was originally
intended.

Most graphically illustrating this
conflict between societal
pressures and human desires is
Bernarda’s mother Maria Josefa
—— 80 years old and an "eerie
premonition of what the
daughters are in danger of
becoming. Maria, a wizened,
white—haired figure costumed in
a yellowed and tattered wedding
dress (reminiscent of Miss
Havisham in G reatlixpectations),
wanders through, the house
moaning what all the daughters
are screaming in their hearts: ‘‘I
want to get married!"

Maria speaks repeatedly of the
sea (a symbol of life), and
consequently, she is a bizarre
symbol of fertility — proclaiming
herself as p“sea-foam” and
desperately listening for‘ the roar
of the ocean in a conch shell
which is tied to her waist.
However, in this barren house,
she hears- nothing. I

Repressed sexuality dominates

The House of Benarda Alba

the production. Yerushalmi’s use
of symbolism —— a rocking horse
placed stage left symbolizes both
fertility (throughout the play there
are references to a stallion who is

throwing himself against the wall ‘

of the barn in a frenzy to mate)
and the futility of being restricted
and unable to move — are both
subtle and powerful.

Also, Adela, the only daughter
who has known a lover, is the
one character who consistently

(and symbolically) wears her hair .

down—— representing her release
from the repression her sisters
suffer. In her bright green dress,
she is a powerful contrast to her
somber sisters, clad in black.

The male characters in this
play are never seen on stage, but
their presence is felt, regardless.
Most memorably, the daughters
see powerful ﬁeld hands through
their windows, and long for the
freedom and joy that can never
be theirs.

Jim \Wood’s set is stark and
monochromatic, a fine

Could you tell me a little
about the band?

Oyo: It started in 1986. I met
Greg just from hangin’ out, goin’
to shows and stuff. We jammed
out for a while in this house, this
basement. We went through a
couple differentbass players, and
we used to have a different singer,
some kid from Ohio. We sucked
real bad! But we just kept with it.

We never had a tight band.
We’d just do it for the hell of it.
We’d just play shows  get a

ﬂaterwaul: a chat with vocalist Betsy Martin

Byjessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Rising out of a desert storm,
Phoenix’s Caterwaul returns with
a ﬂurry of sonic vocals and wall~
,of—sound instrumentation in its

‘latest album Portent.Hue.

Lead singer Betsy Martin’s
phlegmatic croons have brought
on comparisons to other strong
female vocalists such as Siouxsie
and the Banshees, Sinead
O’Connor, Kate Bush and the
Cocteau Twins. But don’t let these
early English gloom analogies
sway you -———— Caterwaul weaves

3, its own mysterious atmosphere.

Poﬁent Hue ranges from the
wildly hypnotic “Manna and
Quail,” and the psychedelic
tapestry in “Bulldosage” to the
stark and simple “This Regret.”

“I was at a club the other night
when they played ‘Cities in Dust’
by Siouxsie, and all I kept thinking
was that we recorded ‘Manna

AU and Quail’ before she did that

song,” says Martin of the constant
comparisons of the singers’

wailing similarities. “We try to get
people like us for us.”

Bassist Fred Cross and Martin
both hail from Arizona, while
guitarist Mark Shaeffer and
drummer Kevin Pinnt are
originally from Iowa. “We all
hooked up in ‘85, and in ‘86,
Kevin started to mail out demos.
In about six months [we] were
picked up,” says Martin. “Nobody
liked us in Phoenix, but there is
a huge music scene [in] Tempe,
and that’s where it was
happening.”

Although their music is played
mostly on college and commercial
alternative stations, they are being

recognized for their enigmatic

and engaging sound. “We’re going
to England and France in June.
They really like us in France; we
still don’t know about England,
though,” says Martin.

In Caterwaul’s unique sound,
Martin’s voice sinuously wraps
itself around Shaeffer’s chords,
while Cross and Pinnt are the
“pillars” of the band. Martin’s
ethereal poetry is a direct result

them, and I was usually right. If I

weren't in music, I'd probably be
working with animals," says
Martin.

Martin tries to raise
environmental consciousness in
the band and among her friends.
“I just want to tell everybody to
‘Go recycle your stuffl.’ It's hard to
recycle when we're on the road,
and I always feel guilty when we
empty the van. 1 always think, ‘I

_ hope somebody picks up that

can.’ “ V
Caterwaul is very much a
cohesive band instead of a vehicle
for Martin's captivating presence,
although sometimes dewy—eyed
men approach her. “I don't think
at all about being a sex symbol,"
she says, laughing. “There were
these two guys in Chicago that
were grabbing me and rubbing
my back. I mean, they were kind
of creepy. I had to get a roadie
from another band that played
that night. I told them, ‘OK, so
you told me what you think about

me. Now go away.’ “

Like a lot of other people in
show business, Crazy keople
director Tony Bill fell into his
profession by accident. A graduate
of Notre Dame with degrees in
English and art, Bill told the dean
that he’d like to make a living as
an actor. I

The dean wrote a casting
director in Los Angeles, and from
there, Bill won a starring role
opposite Frank Sinatra in Come
Blow Your Horn.’ He soon
discovered that he didn’t want to
continue acting because he “didn’t
like the job of waiting for the
phone to ring.”

Instead, he decided to work
behind the cameras as a producer
of such critically acclaimed films
as T be Sting and Taxi Driverwith

partnersjulia and Michael Phillips.

The ﬁlms Bill chooses to back
as a producer must fill certain
criteria. The first thing he looks
for is, of course, originality, and
he tries to stay away from
“retreads” of past ﬁlms. He likes
movies with a sense of humor
and intelligence. “I like to try to
do something different every
time,” he said.

He doesn’t believe in the
Hollywood tendency to set
production trends because he
doesn’t really care what they are
and wouldn’t follow them if [he]
did.

He then began to direct, a role
which he sees as being “complex,
challenging and very rewarding”
but having its disadvantages as
well. Although Bill is a person

who is definitely satisfied with his

chosen profession, he warns

PRI

a-"E

Best Buyyour Exom Appetite!

 

Director Tony Bill discusses Crazy People

future directors about 18-hour
days and his least favorite aspect
of the job —— night shooting.

When asked about getting to
the top in the competitive ﬁelds
of ﬁlm acting and directing, Bill
responded without hesitation to
“do anything you can to earn a
living in the movie business,” and
recommends getting off the
beaten path at auditions or
projects by trying something
different.

In the future, Bill would like to
make a film about the California
gold rush and work again with
actors Jeff Bridges and Julie
Christie.

Continued from page 4
[New York ‘ University] and
hippied out, so we got Bob in late
1987.

Before, we used to argue and
shit all the time, every practice,
just stupid shit. We've been
hangin’ out together so long. We
see each other every day, so it
helps keep it together.

Bob: We're in touch with each
other a lot more now. Before, we
were just playing together, but
we didn’t know each other as
well.

Why do you play hardcore?

Oyo: Hardcore’s the only thing
that still caters to the kids. If you
go to other shows, they don’t
want you to dance. If you just
want to stand there and listen to
the music, then buy the record. If
you're just going to stare at the
band, stare at the picture on the
record. This is supposed to be a
show.

A lot of bands [act like] the only
thing goin’ on‘ is their
performance. ‘Pay attention to
us; pay attention to us!’ When
Laughing Hyenas and Ignition

played, they were on the stage A

getting naked, taking their clothes
off, doin’ like an art thing. They
made their whole show a visual

of themselves, not the music.

Brick: Hardcore’s more street
level than anything, and we’re
from the street,  You can be a
small hardcore band and tour all
over the world, and it’s unique.
You find the same kind of kids
everywhere.

Oyo: When I started out in the
scene — going to the Electric
Banana — there wasn’t even a
stage. The people playing the
music got knocked around just as
much, if not more, than the people
that were dancing. Now there’s
places that say, “No Dancing! No
Stage Diving!” The clubs didn’t
want it in the first place but
couldn't avoid it. Now, a lot of
the bands don’t want it either. 
They look at it as violence. People
that used to be into it now [are]
older, and they feel that they
couldget hurt. A ,

Brick: The thing about
hardcore dancing is, they say it's
to get your aggression out, but it
sort of moves you. It’s not like
“get out and kill each other;” you
just get moved by the music. All
hardcore is to me is having a
good time.

So what happened to the
punk scene? * .

Oyo: Punks don’t play punk
anymore. There isn’t a new

generation of punks. Most of the
kids today consider themselves
to be hardcore kids. It’s gotten to
the point that the older scene
rejects the younger scene and
vice versa. The younger kids say,
“I don’t wanna be no goddamn
punk rocker with a big mohawk,
walkin’ ‘round lookin’ crazy." And
then the older kids say, “The hell
with them kids runnin’ in with
their Nike shoes and their baseball
caps.” They just shut each other
off.

What happened to your
window? (The front window
ofthe apartrnenthasbig holes
in it, covered with cardboard
and tape.)

Oyo: Some kids threw some
bricks through the window. It’s
weird — white power and all
that. They'll say it, but then they’ll
hang out with me. I doubt if it
was racially provoked. It’s just
that an asshole’s« an asshole.

Do you think the Whole
white-power scare was just a
lot of media hype?

Oyo: I know for a fact it is, for
this area anyway. None of these
kids started out as skinheads. As
far asthe people in the scene that
are accepted as skinheads, all
those kids were punks or had
mohawks at one time, unless

they just got into it recently, after
the hype started over the last
couple of years. I used to hang
out with all of them. I used to be
a skinhead.

The same people that are

I used to hang out with every day

complement to the austerity that
envelopes these women, buried
alive by their unwilling chastity.
A design reminiscent of a burial
shroud covers the center-stage
ﬂat, continuing the themes of
sterility and death. The lighting
design of Allan Hahn, contributes
to the sense of foreboding.

Sabrina Reeves (Bernarda) is a
chilling presence — tirelessly
commanding, relentlessly
intimidating, 1 never
acknowledging weakness or
conceding her power.

 As La Poncia (Bernarda’s
A servant), Melanie Shulman is

exhausted by her long years of
servitude in’ “this nunnery,” yet
she confronts the unseeing
Bernarda with the impending
catastrophe that will soon poison
her house. Shulman’s
performance effectively displays

La Poncia’s tenacity in the face of .

powerlessness.
Jennifer Woodward (Maria
josefa) is alternately wistful,

snarling and beseeching. The
skillful makeup of Douglas
Lincoln, the costume design of
Michele Misiti and Woodward’s
good acting all combine to
distinguish this as the most
memorable performance.
Caroline Wood (Angustias),
Eileen Kaden (Amelia), Carey
Cannon (Adela), Anne Marie
Cummings (Martirio) and Suzette
Marie Anderson (Magdalena) give
fine performances as the
daughters — each are effective in
portraying a distinct personality

with an individual way of reacting;

to Bernarda’s tyranny. Especially
good are Cannon and Cummings,
both seen in CMU’s production
of As You Lilee It. Cannon is
wonderfully rebellious" and
sensual, and Cummings is an

appropriately spiteful, wounded ’

Martirio.

This visionary, unified
production is a credit to CMU’s
drama department — it” is

gripping, well—designed and well-
acted. See it.

that hyped here.
lt’s like, “I’m a racist when it's
convenient for me. In my own
neighborhood, with all my friends
who preach the same thing to
each other.” But get out into the
street or come to a show, and
then they don’t have much to say.
A Brick: Safe in a crowd!
Greg: I hope the attitudes that
people had about skins a few
years ago are different because
all that’s changed. I had the same
attitude being a punk as I do as a
skin. A few years back, there
wasn’t a difference; punks were
with skins. No big deal. But then
it became a subculture, [a] fashion
thing.
Oyo: He’s a skin because his
‘ parents paid him $100 to cut off
his mohawk! [laughs]

Greg: No, I’m a skin because‘

I’m a skin. That’s all. Just like
Brick’s straight just because he
wants to be.

Brick: Why am I straight?_

Because I messed with aerosol,
and that does the job.

Oyo: He’s 1 into inhalants.

Bob: He likes to sit around and
smell us getstoned. [laughs]

Bob: You should have seen
him when the cops pulled us
over in [Washington,l DC; We
were smoking a bowl, and the
cops pulled us over. They had‘
him all sprawled out on the car.
He was kicking so much attitude.

Oyo: Straight—edged kids aren't

Oyo: Of course we’ll change.
We’re changing right now. When

like the older you get, the more

annoyed you get with fast and «

loud. I guess you hear it so much
that you have to move on.

When asked about playing 1‘

Pittsburgh, she called outabove
a sound check to the rest of the
band, “Were we ever in
Pittsburgh?” After a moment she
replied, “Yeah, I think we played
in a church. No, I guess it was the
Sonic T emple.”

Caterwaul will be appearing in

Pittsburgh again tonight, this time _

at The Decade.
