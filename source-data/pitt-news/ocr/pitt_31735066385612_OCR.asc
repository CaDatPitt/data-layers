Six years after her landmark surgery,
Stormie Jones returned to Children’s
Hospital for a liver transplant yesterday.

Stormie, 12, came to Children’s for a
heart and liver transplant operation on
February 14, 1984, and was the first survivor
of such a procedure in the world. Because
of complications resulting from hepatitis,
however, it was necessary for her to
return to Pittsburgh to receive another

liver transplant.

Margy Buczynski, a hospital
spokesperson, said, “The surgeons are
confident of her total recovery. The surgery
went very successfully, and there were no
problems.

‘fHer liver problems got critical in the
last couple of weeks. Her mom got the
call Monday morning that an organ was
available. ”

Yesterday’s.operation took 10 hours,
from 3 a.m. to 1 p.rn. Stormie is now listed
in critical condition‘ and is in the intensive

care unit.

“Itwas a short surgery, having taken just
ten hours. These things usually take longer.
This is another good sign for Stormie,”
said Buczynski.

Buczynski said that this operation was a
routine liver transplant. It has received a
lot of media attention because of Stormie’s
original transplant, which gained
worldwide exposure.

“It was a typical liver transplant. The
only difference was that it was Stormie
Jones.”

Stormie is presently given an 80 percent
chance of making a full recovery from this
liver transplant. Buczynski said that she
will be watched very carefully for 72 hours
following the operation, but that no
problems or complications are expected.

Stormie made a tremendous recovery
over the last six years following her initial
surgery, and this procedure probably
would not have been neededif she had
not contracted hepatitis, according to‘
Buczynski. She first began to feel some

‘ Citing an inadequate plan for construction, the Falk School of '
Education has rejected a plan for the building of a new residence-

hall complex on its grounds.

According to'E.J. Strassburger, legal counsel for the Falk School

Panhel elects judicial

board for next term

By Shelena Rauscher
Staff Writer

The members of_ the judicial
board of the Panhellenic
Association were announced at
the Panhel meeting this weekend.

The chief justice of the board was '

chosen at the executive-board
meeting on Tuesday«night.
Chosen as chief justice was
Sally Rubinoff of Delta Phi
Epsilon. Jody Kelly of Kappa

0 Alpha Theta is senior justice, and

junior justice is Mary Kay Nugent

lof Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Sophomore justice is Jennifer
Boas of Delta Gamma. Another
junior justice will be chosen‘ at a
later date.

Those selected‘ were chosen
because of their confidentiality,
fairness, impartiality and the fact
that they "aren’t afraid of climbing
out on a limb and confronting a
problem,” according to Kristi Ifft,

Panhellenic Association
president.
“The purpose of the board is to

deal with rush infractions and
house problems. They must know
the bylaws, policies and
constitution,” said Ifft.

An example of a rush infraction
was given by Nugent; “It could

be something as basic as a throat
lozenge.”

Her example dealt with a rushee
coming to a party at a house and
requesting a throat lozenge. If
someone at the house offers her
a throat lozenge and she leaves
with it, some houses may see it as
a rush infraction; she left with
more than she came with. This
may or may not be in violation of
a rule against rushees receiving

gifts from house’ members. It

would be up to the board to
decide whether the action in
question is actually a rush
infraction. 0

One of the areas that the new
board hopes to work on is

changing the negative feelings

that the board projects. “The board
has a lot of possibilities. It is seen
negatively through the decisions
and decrees that it hands down.

I’d like to do some other things
through education and junior
Panhel to make [the board] seem
more positive," said Rubinoff.

“Now it's more of an overseer of
rules." .

Kelly plans to “meet with
sororities, pledges and rushees
on a personal level so they can
see who we are. I hope to have

Stopping racism concern of STAR

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer .

Six black students were
standing on a corner in Oakland
just talking one night when two
white policemen asked themto
disperse for no apparent reason.
This was just onelof the many
incidents that Matt Sipple said
he witnessed last term on
campus which prompted him
to form Students Against Racism
at Pitt. ‘

“This isn’t the only thing that

I witnessed.’ I’ve seen a lot of .

racialfights around too. After a
while I just got very frustrated,”
said Sipple.

Sipple said that there has
been a recent resurgence of
I‘ racial incidents on college
campuses.

' "What has happened is that

we have taken a leap back to
the times before all the work
was done in the civil rights
movement," he said.
I Sipple decided to form STAR
over the winter break. He has
since drafted a constitution and
expects that the group will
become an official student
organization within a couple of
weeks.

“Our goal is to provide a
strictly anti—racism group. We
are unlike groups like the Black
‘Action Society because what
they are trying to do is to help
people deal with the society_
that we already have. Our group‘
wants to ‘change the society,
not just accept it," he said.

Sipple said that the group
would like to have an impact
on the way the university
administration sees racism.

“I’d like to make them aware
of how severe the problem is.
Maybe they know about it but
they haven't done anything. If
we could get them to take some
sort of action it would be a great
accomplishment,” he said.

Sipple plans to distribute a
questionnaire about racism and
to possibly share the results
with the administration to show
how widespread the problem
is. The group also plans to
invite guest speakers to their
meetings to talk about solutions
to racism.

STAR helc' its third meeting
last night in the William Pitt
Union, but Sipple says that this
gathering was much different
from the first two.

“Our first two meetings, only

about seven people came. This
time we distributed about 700
ﬂiers around campus and more
than 30 attended. That is a big
change,” he said.

Sipple said that prior to last
night’s meeting, a group of
skinheads confronted him in
the Union. He said that they
wanted to cause trouble.

“They said that they weren't
white supremacists but it was
fairly obvious that they were
not in favor of what we were
doing,” Sipple said. Another
skinhead group,‘ Skinheads
Against Racial‘ Prejudice,
attended and expressed their
support for STAR.

Sipple hopes that STAR can
organize an event to bring
different campus groups
together to learn about racism.

“We I have to make people
see that differences in race aren’t
a disadvantage, they are an
advantage for everyone,” he
said, “People who are racists
are just afraid of other people.
It all goes back to ignorance."

‘ STAR’s next meeting will be
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Schenley Cafe.

we want with the money, but we
can’t do enough."

This money would go into the
fund of the school, which is run
by the university. The F alk School
gets its funds through a budget
set aside by Pitt.

One of the problems the school
will face is a lack of air
conditioning. “Right now we don’t
need air conditioning,"
Strassburger said. “But with the
construction, we will need to
keep the windows closed, both
for the noise and the dust that

Stormie

will be created.”

Thomas Hussey, director of
Facilities Management, attributed
the noise to the environment of
the school. “They are attending
school in a heavily populated
area, ” he said, “and naturally there
will be some disruption of classes.
That's part of life in a city.”

Another major problem will be
the destruction of an 80-yard
playing field to make room for
the dorm complex. The field is to
be replaced by a smaller playing
area.

“The area on the other side

where the new playing area is to
be is not good enough,”
Strassburger said. “They’re giving
us a 50-yard playing area. This
would be good enough for
second— and third-grade children,
but for junior-high students, it
just isn't enough room.” He also
said that a recently built
playground for the younger
children would have to be moved.

Hussey did not see any problem
with the recreation area. “Yes,
there will be a smaller playing
field,” he said. “But the students
will also be able, under schedule,

discomfort from her liver two
months ago. Once the doctors
realized that it was hepatitis that
had affected her liver, she was
placed on the critical organ donor
list until one became available on
Monday morning.

“The only real difference with
this procedure and other liver
transplants was that she was given

FK-S06,” Buczynski said.
FK-506 is the new anti-rejection
drug developed by Dr. Thomas
Starzl and his team of surgeons
and researchers at Presbyterian-
University Hospital, and it is
presently used exclusively at
Presby and Children’s. FK—506 is
a more effective drug for
transplants than cyclosporine.
Stormie has been taking FK—

SO6 since November, when her
doctors began to fear rejection of
her liver by her body. Because of
the drug, what was once a six-to-
eight week hospital stay should
only be about three to four wee ks.

She will remain in the intensive

care unit for five to seven days,

and then she will be moved to a
regular hospital room for three to
four weeks. I

So in fact they will be getting an
improved playing area."

According to Marty Chetlin,
architect for the development, the
residence area would resemble a
community. “The area would be
broken up by buildings,” he said.
“There will be dorms, along with
a separate commons building,
which would house a cafeteria, a
seminar hall and an exercise area.”
The buildings in the complex
would range from five to 15 stories
in height.

The entire complex, according
to Hussey, has a projected cost of
$40 million. _

“lPittl says that they are
bargaining in good faith,”
Strassburger said, “but some of
them aren’t. Their offer is

programs that emphasize
positive areas as well as
negative ones like liability
and drugs.”

Nugent hopes to make
the board a more positive
aspect of the association.
“My goal is to let them know
[the board] is a resource and
should be used all year. I’d
like them to know we’re
approachable. We can act
in a positive manner," she
said.

“I’m very eager. When you

thers couldn't

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ — If
you would have told the Pitt
Panthers that a freshman guard
from Seton Hall would score the
second most points ever in a Big
East game last night, they would
have simply lamented the fact
that one of the most highly
recruited players in the country,
Terry Dehere, burned them.

But suffice it to say, that the
name Marco Lokar would not
immediately pop into the heads
of Pitt coach Paul Evans and his
team. Yet in Newjersey last night,
Lokar, getting his first start of the
year, almost single handedly
destroyed the Panthers with 41
points in an 86-81 Seton Hall win.

“We knew he was a good
shooter,” Evans said. “That was
his reputation. We had three guys
try to cover him in the first half
and none of them could do it.”

Pitt fell to 10-14 overall (4-8 in
Big East) and into a tie for seventh
place in the conference with Seton
Hall (11-15).

Lokar had 25 points in the first
half alone, as the Hall jumped out
to a 43-29 lead. He shot 13-15
from the field in the first half,
including 5-5 from three point
range. V

“I just felt good tonight,” Lokar
said. “There was no real turning
point, they were just
concentrating on Terry in the first
half and I had some open shots."

Dehere, meanwhile, picked up

eton Hall

game and did not see much action
the rest of the way.

Only Brian Shorter’s 13 points
kept Pitt out ofblow out range in
the first half.

At 12:58 in the second half Pitt
started a 10 point run that put it
right back in the game. Bobby
Martin had six points in the surge
and saw the SH lead turn to 60-58
with just over 8:00 left. Lokar hit
a three point shot to get Seton
Hall going again. But the Panthers
unrelenting press allowed them
one last streak.

In fact, Pitt guard Jason
Matthews hit two foul shots, to
give the Panthers their first lead
of the game, 74-73, with just 4:59
left.

An ironic twist followed as the
game’s final minutes ticked off.
After Matthews’ free throws, Seton
Hall forward Michael Cooper, hit
a lay up to give SH the lead again.
The teams traded baskets from
there until Oliver Taylor, the man
who was late for practice
yesterday and thus allowed Lokar
to start in his place, took over.

Taylor make six free throws in
the final 34 seconds to seal Pitt’s
fate.

A final Panther attempt to tie
the game, was aborted when
Matthews had the ball striped
from him by Cooper with 3
seconds left.

Martin lead Pitt for the game
with 23 points, followed closely
by Matthews and Shorter, who
each had 21. ‘

Lockout may cause drop in baseball card value

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

As winter gets ready to close its curtain on another year, the annual signs of spring
begin to sprout around the area. Birds migrate north after a season-long vacation,
and college students migrate south to take their place. Mercury inches its way up
the thermometer; winter clothes begin their annual hibernation, and folks will try
to remember, “‘Is it spring forward, fall back or vice versa?” ‘

And of course  the new baseball cards come out.

For millions of collectors around the country, the opening of the ﬁrst pack of new
cards is the first ofﬁcial act of spring.

For baseball, fans around the country, however, collecting cards is the only action
they may see in the sport for a while, because of the major- league owner’s lockout
of the players. 5

And several local sportscard dealers are concerned that if the owner’s lockout
spills over into the regular season, the hobby will also suffer.

“It will definitely hurt business,” said George Ryder, owner of two area sportscard

stores. “People buy cards according to a player’s performance; if that player isn’t

able to perform, then his cards won’t sell.”

“People will buy aJose Canseco card so that they can track his progress, as well
as the progress of his cards,” said Ron Steinberg of Sportsworld Specialties, a
downtown sports memorabilia store. “If he isn’t able to play, people will lose
interest.”

Despite the possible lack of major-league action this year, several local dealers
have reported brisk business thus far. The hobby has grown into a billion-dollar
business, and prices are skyrocketing. For instance, a 1968 card of Nolan Ryan sold
for $550 at the end of October but now commands a $1,700 tag.

In fact, one 1990 card of Baltimore Oriole rookie pitcher Ben McDonald, by the
Upper Deck Company, is already selling for over $100 if it has the Oriole team logo
on the front instead of a special “Rookie” logo. Otherwise, the card sells for a “paltry”
$5.

According to both dealers, McDonald’s is only one of live 1990 cards already
selling for over $2.

Rice, Ellis

By Chris rsosak
Sports Editor

Sam Rice and Elbert Ellis each
notched two victories as the Pitt
men's track team placed second
at the Big East Indoor
Championships held in Syracuse

. last weekend.

Georgetown ran away with the
team's top honors with 168 points.
With 122 points Pitt was well
ahead of third-place Syracuse,
82.

“I think we could have done
even better, but a lot of guys did
a great job for us,” said Pitt Coach
John Vasvary. “We just ran across
a ‘pretty good team in
Georgetown. They're good all
the way around, but we have a lot
-to be proud of."

Rice was the victor in the 55-
meter and the 200-meter dashes.
Fellow Pitt runner Brian Whitley
ﬁnished ahead of Rice in the 200,
but was disqualified because he
stepped over his lane. According

to Vasvary, the track at Syracuse
is difficult to run on, and many
people crossed the line; Whitley
just happened to be the one who
got caught. Whitley also placed
second behind Rice in the 55.

Despite Rice’s two victories, he
was denied the Outstanding
Performer Award. Georgetown’s
Chris Brown received the award,
even though Rice beat him in the
55 and the 200. Brown was second
in the 200, third in the S5 and
won the 400.

“Sam got robbed on it,” said
Vasvary. “I don’t know why he

wasn’t the Outstanding Performer.
He beat [Brown] twice.”

Ellis took top honors in the 150
high hurdles and was part of the
winning 1,600 relay team. Neil
Malobicky, Whitley and Chappale
Burton covered the relay distance
with Ellis. According to Vasvary,
Burton lost the lead in the last leg
of the race, but dug in and pulled
out the victory for the Panthers.

“lBurton’s] been the heart of
our team in terms of spirit and
motivation,” said Vasvary of the
senior. Burton also took second
in the 400 run.

Darrin Gillaspie won the high-
jump event, sailing over the bar
set at 6—foot-10.75— inches.

Dave Senay took second in the
shot put and Malobicky placed
second in the 200 dash.

Keith Dowling took third in the
mile and the 3,000 runs. “Two-
thirds might not seem like much,
but in this conference that's tough
to do,” said Vasvary.

Todd Walthall placed third in
the 55 high hurdles. Pitt’s distance
medley relay of Chris Nauman,
Bret Shields, Jason Bodnar and
Matt Colton also took a third.

taken up the hobby in order to
grab a share of the potentially
enormous proﬁts.

Ryder remembers how the

_strike of 1981 hurt the hobby,

which has now grown into a
billion—dollar business.
“After [the strike], cards really

took a nose dive, and they never‘

really recovered for two or three
years,” Ryder said.

No less than five companies
have issued cards, for the
upcoming season —-— with several
more on the way — so dealers
are hoping that an extended
lockout —won’t‘ disenchant fans.

“When [fans] see players
holding out for millions of dollars,
they expect them to play,” Ryder
said. “People will lose interest

- very fast; it’s like ‘out of sight, out

of mind.’ If there’s no baseball,
people will do something else.”

Fun

Continued from page 5

That’s what blew me away.

» Remember now, Josh is ten-
years old. He is talking about
investments. Not in mutual funds
but baseball cards. He’s been
brainwashed.

This whole baseball card thing
is now ridiculous. From what I
understand, certain 1990 star cards
and “future star” cards , are
considered to be more expensive
than an unopened pack. For
instance, say a pack of cards
costs 50 cents; it is possible that
you can come across a Ben
McDonald star rookie card that is
being valued at ten dollars.

Make sense?

Not really. But McDonald is
supposed to be awesome
someday, so in the skewed minds
of the card dealer, ten bucks
could prove to be a real bargain.

Whatever these dealers want
to pay for a piece of mass-
produced cardboard is fine with
me. That’s not the problem.

 

What galls me to no end is
watching these pot—bellied,
scraggly-bearded morons haggle
with twelve-year olds over the
“actual value” of a 1987 Eric Davis
card. They are taking advantage
of the youngsters innocent love
of sportsstars.

The dealer is out to milk as
much money as he can from the
cards, while the kids are simply
trying to build a nice little
collection of their baseball idols
to trade and look at for fun.

Or is it the other way around
now?
