New Low
Restricting

Free Copying

By SUEMcFARLAND
Pm News Staff Writer

With the enactment of a new
copyright law, effective Jan. 1, Pitt
students and faculty have several
restrictions placed on their right to
freely photocopy materials and to
perform musical works -without
paying required royalty and copy-
right fees.

The new law affects the
University in all areas including
concert programming by the Office
of Student Activities.

“The situation is not as
disastrous as we once thought it
might be,” said Bud Heaps,

 ‘director of the Office of Student

Activities, in reference to his
previous statement that the cost of
concert programming could double
as a result of the new law.

“What it means is that, in

addition to paying the performer for

CAS Council
Talks SGS
Cross-List

ByKARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

A proposal allowing night
students registered in the School of
General Studies (SGS) to cross-list
in day courses only offered to
students enrolled in the College of
Arts and Sciences dominated
discussion at Monday's CAS
Council meeting.

Introducing the long-range plan
as “a very interesting option, ” CAS
Dean Robert Marshall said the
proprosed move would incorporate
“more daytime features into
nighttime programs” than those
that now exist.

Currently, SGS students aren’t
permitted to take CAS courses on
either a part-time or full-time basis.
On the other hand, CAS students
are allowed to cross-list SGS
courses with limitations.

If enacted, the proprosal would

Grad Job Outlook: Engineers, Lead the Pack

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

The high employment demand
for engineers and students ex-

'{?3‘perienced in technical fields

continues, according to Daniel
Nagy, University coordinator of
career development and place-
ment. '

Citing last year’s placement
record, Nagy said 100 percent of
the engineers using Pitt’s Place-
ment Service found employment,
except for civil engineers, who had
an 80 percent placement success
rate. Computer science, chemistry,
physics and math majors also had a
high success rate, with 80 percent
placement.

“Medical technology, physical
therapy and nursing are still very
good areas, with almost 100

‘,"”i‘j‘=._rcent employment for graduates
. /in these fields,” Nagy said.

He also reported that career
opportunities for Master’s of
Business Administration are good,
but that the ﬁeld is becoming
bloated.

“The problem is that everybody
is going into M.B.A. programs.
Those who get a liberal arts degree
and cannot ﬁnd a job see M.B.A.
programs as their salvation,” said
Nagy. “The job market is good for
M.B.A.’s but there are only so

t_l"“’\ any jobs available. The competi-
 ;(ion is intense.”

Students in liberal arts ﬁelds are
placed at a rate of only 50 or 60

 

percent, according to Nagy. How-
ever, Nagy stressed that this ﬁgure
is- not complete, since only 35
percent of the liberal arts majors
use placement services.
According to Nagy, many liberal
arts majors are not placed
immediately, but they eventually
find jobs. “Liberal arts majors do
not get placed as soon as other
students, butthey do get placed as
time goes along,” Nagy said.

Dr. Richard Allshouse, director
of the Educational Placement
Ofﬁce, said that some 80 percent of
undergraduates in the School of
Education are being placed.
According to Allshouse, education
majors who teach business, trade

or industrial subjects and computer ’

science are easy to place. Students
with double majors in related
ﬁelds, such as math and physical
science, or with experience in ﬁelds

 

such as sports or water safety
instruction, are sought by school
systems, he said.

Allshouse emphasized that ﬁnd-
ing a job for an education major
who is unwilling to relocate can be
difficult.

“Many education majors (with-
out jobs) don’t have a job because
they do not want to leave the
tri-state area,” stated Allshouse.

and...‘

“If they go South, they can get
jobs almost immediately.”

Areas of education in which jobs
are scarce include elementary
education, special education, social
sciences and languages, Allshouse
said. In these areas, Pitt still
manages to place 75 to 80 percent
of its graduates.

Allshouse also predicted changes
within some educational ﬁelds in
the next few years. “E-mphasis on
world ‘peace is going to bring more
emphasis on language and com-
munications,” said Allshouse.
“We are going to come back to
math, despite the fact that we now
are giving students the easy way
out (by not requiring math
courses).” «

“The number of companies
coming on campus to recruit has
increased tremendously,” said
Nagy. Three-hundred companies
recruited on campus last year and
430 are planning to recruit on
campus this year, he said. “We’re
running out of rooms where we can
put recruiters when they come on
campus to recruit.”

“We are on the peak of a market
now,” Nagy said. “Demand is
extremely high, especially in
technical ﬁelds, but next year it’s
going to begin to drop off.”

He also said that recruitment is
rising in the arts areas. “ .-ven in
those areas (liberal arts) recruit-
ment is up,” Nagy said.

SU Revamping: An Update

By DAVE KIRSHNER

Preliminary contractual agree-
ments for the renovation of the
Student Union are being ﬁnalized,
according to Bud Heaps, director of
Student Activities.

The architectural firm of
Williams, Trebilcock, Whitehead
has been chosen over several
companies recently interviewed by
a University task force, Heaps said.

“The ﬁrm was chosen on the
basis of its expertise in renovation
for future needs,” he said.

In addition to alleviating over-
crowded conditions among student
organizations housed in the
Student Union, the renovation will
be aimed at improving the traffic of
people throughout the building and
at constructing new facilities.

“We see a need for more
meeting rooms, different styles of
dining areas, a newsstand and a
revitalized information center,"
Heaps said. “We need to improve
practice rooms for music groups.
and construct better performance
areas.”

The Student Union was built as a
hotel in 1898, and always has had
“a progressive” tradition, Heaps
said.

“The attitude towards renova-
tion is ‘nothing is sacred,’ ” he

said. “The entrances may be
changed....the front doors of the
Lower Lounge may be used.”
The age and structure of the
building have necessitated this
attitude, according to Heaps.
The renovation, which will
proceed in phases, primarily will

‘involve internal alterations, clue to

cost and convenience, according to
Heaps.

“Funding has not been dis-
cussed, and probably won’t be until
we send in the preliminary
drawings,” Heaps explained. “We
are at the beginning of the
beginnings. At present there is no
idea of cost.”

However, Heaps has been
thinking of possible sources of
revenue.

“I have given consideration to
perhaps, in the future, asking for a
referendum to increase the student
activities fee minimally over a
10-to-20-year period.

“It’s everybody's Student
Union, even after they get out. As
we develop the policy board, we
would invite alumni to participate
financially,” Heaps said.

The policy board would assist in
setting a direction for the project’s
progress, Heaps said.

Input in the renovation, through

Mosque Turned Into GOP ‘Carnival’

B) The Assoualcd Prcss

PITTSBURGH—A brass band, straw hats and high-ﬂying
candidates gave a carnival effect Tuesday night to Allegheny
County’s Republican nominating convention.

Billed as_ the largest GOP rally in the state, the convention
attracted nearly 1,500 representatives of the county’s 240,000
registered Republicans. ‘

“I’d like to ﬁll the house,” said county party chairman Ted
Jacob as he met committeemen at the door of the 3,000-seat Syria
.Mosque in this city’s Oakland section. “But I don’t know if we can
do it.”

Jacob spent $6,000 on media advertising and mailed letters to
lure Republican committeemen to the meeting, which was to
endorse one of ﬁve candidates for governor.

Former Deputy U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh of
Pittsburgh -was expected to lead the slate against former state
House Minority Leader Robert Butera of Montgomery "County,
former Philadelphia District Attorney Arlen Specter and state
Senate Minority Leader Henry Hager of Williamsport. Alvin
Jacobson of Abbotstown is also an announced candidate.

Red Satellite Down, Radiation Fear Up

By The /\s\ULl:lIL‘d Prcss

YELLOWKNIFE, Canada—A nuclear-powered Soviet spy
satellite fell from orbit into the atmosphere above this remote
region of northwest Canada on Tuesday, streaking vividly and
soundlessly across the pre-dawn sky and raising some fears of
radioactive contamination.

Canadian and U.S. officials said there was probably no serious
danger. But ﬁve American military airplanes, to be joined later by
four Canadian planes, ﬂew to the scene, 850 miles north of the U.S.
border, to check for radioactivity and possible remnants of the
fallen spacecraft.

“When it came overhead and we could get a good look at it, I
could see dozens and dozens of parts,” said Yellowknife resident
Marie Ruman. “Each part had a long, bright tail....As it was
disappearing the main piece turned bright red. It was just

I fantastic.”

Canadian officials said any pieces of the satellite would have
slammed into the earth in a sparsely settled area 60 miles east of
Yellowknife, a frontier town of 8,000 on Great Slave Lake.

Canadian Defense Minister Barney Danson said he was “98
percent or more” certain the satellite, carrying 100 pounds of

_ highly radioactive enriched uranium 235, had burned up in the
atmosphere.

Carter Orders Spy Revamp

By The Associated Press .

WASHINGTON—President Carter ordered a major reorganiza-
tion of the U.S. intelligence community yesterday, terming his
action a “major step forward” in safeguarding both the national
interest and civil liberties.

Carter signed at a White House ceremony a bulky executive
order designed not only to streamline the intelligence set-up but
also to put strict new curbs on covert activities that drew ﬁre from
congressional investigators. The restrictions include an outright
ban on attempted political assassinations.

The president took the occasion to express his “sincere and
complete conﬁdence” in Adm. Stansﬁeld Turner, an Annapolis
classmate he named as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Turner emerges from the reorganization with enhanced authority,
particularly over the preparation of budgets not only for CIA but
also for the Pentagon's National Security Agency and Defense
Intelligence Agency. However, administration officials

, acknowledged Turner did not get all the expanded powers he
-.sought.

his services, we also must pay the
copyright fee on the music that he
performs. In the area we have made
an arrangement with the American
Society of Composers and Perform-
ers (ASCAP), the Broadcast Musi-
cians Incorporated (BMI) and the
Society of European Stage Authors
and Composers (SESAC).” In
agreement, a distinction was made
between the two types of copyright
payments governing musical works,
Heaps said.

The. Performance payments to
rock bands will carry a copyright fee
of one to ﬁve cents per seat in the
place of performance, Heaps said.

“In a place like the Syria Mosque,
which has 2,000 seats, we would be
paying a nominal fee,” he said.

The other type of copyright
payment, referred to as “non-
performance,” includes such areas
as football halftime shows, and
Greek sings, and will carry a per
capita fee of 12 cents per Pitt
student, Heaps said. To avoid
confusion, the fees from Pitt branch
campuses will be compiled under
the same heading as those from the
Oakland campus. This will ease the
burden on the campuses with
smaller concert allocations, he
added.

“It is a fair law, and we wish to
comply with it while making the
situation as easy on ourselves as
possible,” Heaps said, adding that
he sees no increase in student
activities as a result of this new law.

The new copyright law also will
prohibit students from making
excessive copies of copyrighted
materials on coin-operated ma-
chines. Only a single copy of a
copyrighted article may be made
under the new law; exceeding the
one-copy limit requires special
permission from the publisher.

Alden Bowen, Student Affairs
attorney, believes the new law will
be enforced, particularly in the area
of music royalties, with
checking by groups such as ASCAP

Although enforcement of the use
of coin-operated machines may
prove difﬁcult, Bowen believes spot
checking will enforce the law.

Penalties for violation of this new
copyright law range from $250 to
$50,000, with jail sentences being
levied for serious or repeat
offenses.

A Dec. 2 workshop that attracted
more than 300 participants served
to publicize and inform the public as
to -the complexities of the new law.
Dr. William Nasri, an assistant
professor in Pitt’s Graduate School
of Library and Information Sciences
and an attorney specializing in
copyright law, served as the
workshop’s director.

Nasri said he believed the former

copyright law, drawn up in 1909,

was outjof date and not in keeping
with the technological advances

that have since been made. _ .

‘.‘In 1909,‘ there’  no machines- 3
to reprciduce materials. This_i§;why"

the former law now isso archaic. It
was quite effective at the time it was
written, but not now,” Nasri said.

When asked if he thought a law as

far reaching and complex as the new,‘

copyright law could ever be
enforced, Nasri replied, “there is
not a law existing that can be and is
totally enforced. Take, for instance,
the trafﬁc law that states no one is
permitted to exceed 55 m.p.h. Not
everyone obeys this law, and not
everyone who breaks this «law is
prosecuted.’ ’

Nasri recently authorized a
University-wide photocopying pol-
icy, distributed by the Provost’s
ofﬁce, to educate persons here
about the new law.

Nasri also has been awarded a
state grant to conduct four
workshops on the subject of
copyright law in Pennsylvania. One
of these will be held Jan. 30 in the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

« SGS Cross-List Discussed

(Crmlinuedfronz Page I)
permit SGS students to select
courses offered by CAS on either a
part-time or full-time basis.

“Now, we have an irrational
structure,” Marshall said. “You
have full-time night students who
want to be full-time day students.
The University of Pittsburgh wants
to push continuing education in
order to encourage professional and
personal development, but some
SGS students can’t do that during
the day. They're restricted to
taking night courses.”

Cross-registered CAS and SGS
courses, Marshall said, would
permit daytime students to obtain
professionally-oriented degrees in
such ﬁelds as business, journalism

public administration, and urban -

planning.

_ 7 Marshall said if a student wishes

to obtain a business degree, for
example, he is now restricted to
taking such courses in SGS.

“We’re under the false impres-
sion that business courses are
easy,” Marshall added. “This is
not true. There is much competition
to get into business school.
Combined SGS and CAS courses
could offer a business major to the
daytime student. This would be a
giant change.”

Council member Herbert Chesler
disagreed with the new proposal.
Citing the intrusion of SGS students
into CAS courses, Chesler said it
was vague as to what responsibility
the SGS will have in the plan.

“If we adopt this plan, we may
have to hire a staff who would know
how to deal with a new type of
student,” Chesler said. “What is

the purpose of incorporating the
. A . L a . A n . » n-«....A..L—»..A.s.L.-4-

SGS and CAS courses? What
responsibility will the SGS have, if
any? How will they be intruded
upon?” '

Other proposals discussed at the
meeting included common courses
freshmen and sophomores would be
required to take before declaring
their majors in their junior years,
the adoption of a double-major
option encouraging students to take
both a departmental major and a
second major or minor in some
pre-professional ﬁeld like business,
journalism, public administration,
or urban planning.

“These proposals are just the tip
of the iceberg,” Marshall said.

“This is just the beginning of the _

The two letters on this page regarding last Friday’s school’s in,

‘the University will not repeat their Jan. 20 performance. S _

By seven o’clock- Friday morning, the snow had piled high
enough to block many people—including Pitt professors,
administrators, staff and students—into their garages and
driveways. ‘Public transportation was overloading and slowing

down (and it hasn’_t recovered yet).

Several more inches of snow already were forecast by early
morning, and a look out the window confirmed the hazardous
driving reports. Disc jockeys did virtually nothing that morning

‘besides broadcast school closings. But Pitt was not among them.

As a result, students and employees—those who were afraid they

‘were going to miss something, at least—were forced to venture"

forth under the worst possible circumstances. We can be thankful
no serious accidents involving Pitt personnel occurred that day.

Of course, we appreciate the University’s efforts to pack as much
teaching and learning as possible into each trimester. But we hope
that in the future, a little better judgment will be applied to
situations involving everyone’s health and safety.

Setting An Irresponsible Example

I’m sure I speak for many others
in voicing my complete and utter
dismay with the ability of the
University administration to make
any kind of a meaningful decision
during the past few days as it
concerned our weather problems.

What makes our administrators
think traffic is easier to plow
through for the 60 percent of the
student body who are commuters,
than it is for all the other commuters
of our community? Where would
we have parked if those of us who
have our own transportation had
made the ._ridiculous attempt to
attend classes?

On Friday J an.'20, we waited and
waited for a formal announcement
that classes were canceled. Gov-

The Mergingof

By R. DAVID TIVE

A poll released this past
weekend by The New York Times
and CBS News indicates more
Americans consider themselves

I conservative rather than liberal,
and that the size of that gap is

steadily increasing.

Of those responding to the poll,
42 percent described themselves as
either moderately or very conserva-
tive, compared to only 23 percent
who took the labels of moderately
or very liberal. An additional 27
percent were middle-of-the-road,
and 8 percent didn’t know where
they were. However, the results of

stores, shopping malls and area‘

businesses announced closings, as
did other universities in the area,
but not Pitt. Through phone calls to
different areas within the Univer-
sity we found that most personnel

. did not even show up for work, but

still no announcement from the
University administration. Is this
the kind of lesson in responsibility
that we are to learn from our
University administrators who were

also not to be found last Friday V

morning? Maybe our administra-
tors are taking their lessons from
our state government, who also
seem to lack the ability to made
decisions as it relates to the
universities.

the poll also show that while more
people tend to label themselves
conservatives, few people can
describe the differences between
conservative and liberal views.
Traditionally, conservatism has
had, at its core, the basic belief that
government should not become
overly involved in too many aspects
of American life. It has concerned
itself primarily with business and
economics, but also has taken a
consistent stand with regard to
personal rights. Liberalism, as one
might suspect, has taken the
opposite stance, that it is the
responsibility of government to
regulate the marketplace in order

Letters To The Editor

The Collapse of the University’s Chain of Command

Certainly one of the most absurd
decisions ever made by this
University (and there have been
plenty of absurd ones) was the
decision to declare, during the
height of one of the most severe
snow storms in recorded history,
the Universtiy would be open on
Friday, Jan. 20, 1978.

As I struggled to get to work that
morning, I became more and more
incensed with every passing
snowﬂake. I decided my morning’s
work would consist of finding out
how the decisions to keep the
University open had been made.
Yes, to attempt to understand the
ﬁne workings of the high-level
college administrator’s mind.

My first call went to the
Chancellor’s ofﬁce, which neatly
passed the buck? by informing me
the decision to close the University
lay ‘in the hands of the Provost’s
office. Ah, yes, Rhoten Smith; the
guy with two last names. 0.K., Mr.
Smith, what’s the story? I
wondered what strange and exotic

muse had convinced Mr. Smith to
keep Pitt open during the re-emerg-
ence of the Ice Age? Was it the
Snow Fairy? The Tooth" Fairy?
Frosty the Snowman? Suzie
Chapstick? The mystery burned
within me, and I felt I must go to the
Fountainhead, the source of this
superior intelligence that had
conveniently overlooked common
sense. I could hardly control my
nervous anticipation as my fingers
did the walking and dialed the
Provost’s ofﬁce at 10:15 a.m. The
secretary answered, and I asked,
“Why hasn’t this University been
closed?” She answered that she, of
course, didn’t know. “Well,” I
replied, sensing the kill, “let me
speak to the Provostl”

“He isn’t here,” came the reply.

Not there? Notthere?! By 10:15.
After deciding all of the peons had
to report for business as usual...

“Look, how long will this place
stay open? It’s absurd to keep it
open. Don’t you think it’s crazy to

stay open? Were you happy to come
to work today?”

“Well, they’re working on thw

decision right now.”

“Working on a decision? Work-
ing on it? What is there to work on?
The snow isn’t falling upwards, you
know. Please tell Mr. Steele that.”

- So that’s how decisions are made,
I thought. The great chain of
command‘. Well, to Mr. Steele’s
credit, the place was ﬁnally shut
down. As I heard the announce-
ment over a loudspeaker near the
Towers, Iwondered how the hourly
employees sitting on PAT buses
would feel when they arrived in
Oakland to ﬁnd that work had been
called off. I wondered how the
people who had wrecked their c I’
trying to get to the 2-hour workday
felt. How do you feel about last
Friday? Why not let the Provost
know?

Liberal and Conservative

to provide for the common good,
and also to insure the. maximum
responsible exercise of personal
and human rights.

The Times-CBS poll indicates
that, to a great extent, the
difference is being eroded and, in
one area, is in danger of
disappearing entirely.

On three questions, whether the
government ought to insure the
availability of low-cost medical care
for everyone, ought to insure a job
for all those who want one, and
ought to set standards to alleviate
hazardous working conditions, the
difference between the percentage
of conservatives and the
percentage of liberals responding
yes was minimal, barely greater
than the minimum statistical
deviation. Both groups responded
overwhelmingly yes. Even as
recently as 10 years ago, such
questions would have shown a
sharp liberal-conservative dif-
ference. The philosophical distinc-
tions with regard to governmental
involvement in economic and social
processes seem to no longer exist,
and have been resolved in favor of
the traditional liberal view.

In the area of personal rights,
differences still exist. but there
have been changes. Liberals and
conservatives are still far apart on
issues such as abortion, marijuana
legalizaiton and pornography. But

it is the conservatives who now
want to see governmental action in
the form of specific laws or
constitutional amendments prohi-
biting such activities, and the
liberals who believe the govern-
ment can best insure personal
freedom by staying out of it.

The rising importance of person-
al rights as a liberal-conservative
battleground was demonstrated in
another way by the Times-CBS
poll. Of those surveyed, 46 percent
could not give an answer to the
question, “What do you think is
the biggest difference between

liberal views and conservative
views? " Of the half that did
answer, 17 percent said the

difference was one of the attitudes
toward spending and economics,
and 17 percent said it was one of
personal manner or lifestyle. Here
again, personal rights are per-
ceived as being as important as
anything else in separating conser-
vatives from liberals. It is
interesting to note that “national
defense," the key element of
difference in the 1950's was given
as a response so few times as to not
even merit a mention on the survey
results.

The signiﬁcance of these results
is quite clear, and very disturbing.
Political leaders will look at the
ﬁgures and try to determine where
to aimjtheir appeal to draw the
largest popular response. For

conservatives there is only one
option. Large potions of their
constituency have adopted a liberal
perspective _on domestic a ,
economic issues. The most fe .

ground for them to plow is the area I

of personal and human rights; that
is the only place where a significant

conservative-liberal differences

exists. The best way for them to

take advantage of that split is to .

campaign for more restriction and
limitation of the freedom of
individuals to responsibly act as
they wish.

Such a campaign, and the
controversy that would accompany

result, perhaps unintentionally," ’

it, is scary. It could very easilﬁ

the ending of some basic persona « *

freedoms that are at the corner-
stone of our society. A number of
surveys over the past several years
have indicated that if given the
opportunity today to ratify or reject
ideas contained in the Bill of
Rights, the voters of the United
States would decisively defeat
them.

I don't want to be a fearmonger
and raise the spectre of tyranny
and repression in the United
States, but it should be a matter of

serious concern that persona.’’‘i
‘!
freedoms may become our nex 

great political battleground. Let's
hope the American people have
enough good sense to resolve the
battle responsibly.

By JULIE GRAHAM

During the past few ‘months,

much world attention has been
focused on the recent Mid-East
talks between Israeli Prime Minis-
ter Begin and Egyptian President

Sadat. Many people saw these talks
as a positive step toward a lasting
peace in the Mid-East, a region
engaged in four wars in the past 30
years.

In November, a preliminary
peace conference was held in Cairo
in which all participants of the
Geneva conference were invited. At
the same time, another conference
was held in Libya’. This is often
called the rejectionist conference,
because it is assumed that those
countries who went are extremists
who love war, and are horriﬁed at

By MARK MURPHY

What do you call a person who
promises something, breaks that
promise, then concocts a story to
avoid implicating himself in the
whole affair? You might call that
person a shrewd liar. I would call
him the President of the United
States. -

Jimmy Carter has proved he is as
adept at bungling the most sensitive
problems as his predecessor was at
rolling down ski slopes. The latest
corner he has painted himself into
involves U.S. Attorney for Eastern
Pennsylvania David Marston, a
Republican appointee from the Ford
administration.

 During his remarkable campaign

for the Presidency, Carter promised
he would choose Federal attorneys
on the basis of merit alone. He
would not, as Presidents before him
had done, pick these prosecutors
solely because they were members
of his party.

Along comes his ﬁrst chance to
live up to that promise, and Carter
blows it. Marston, best-known for
convicting Pennsylvania House

.Speaker Herbert Fineman on

influence peddling charges and
forcing state Senator Henry Cian-
frani to plead guilty to a 106-count
indictment, has been ﬁred because

    
 

, he is a Republican. What is‘ worse,

A th Carter and Attorney General
Grifﬁn Bell don’t deny it. .

 

‘ ‘We have two parties,” Bell said
recently. “The ‘ins’ are the
Democrats. They can get in and
complain easier than the other party

99

can.

the thought of peace. Hence they
reject peace and have been labeled
“rejectionists.”

Everybody wants peace in the
Mid-East. The countries at the
conference in Libya have demanded
that Arab unity not be split and that
Israel recognize the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as the
legitimate representatives of the
Palestinian people, and recognize
the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people. They have also
insisted upon Israel’s return to the
1967 borders. Of these demands it is
key that Israel recognize the right of
the Palestinian people to their own
nation.

Zionism is an aggressive force in
the Mid-East, and has continually
followed a foreign policy of
expansionism into bordering coun-

tries. This began in 1948, when
Israel took the land given to the
Palestinians, causing them to
become refugees. Since then they
have continued expanding, taking
land from many of the surrounding
countries.

For any serious peace settlement
to come about, Zionist aggression
and expansion must be stopped.
Even during the recent talks, Israel
was continuing to build homes in
the dccupied territory. The Israelis
offered to give back some of the
occupied 1and——-the Sinai-—but
demanded that Israeli troops
continue to be stationed there.

A fundamental question to be
dealt with is the right of the
Palestinian people to self-deter-
mination. Israel is not, and never
has been prepared to deal with this

iwedhesday. January‘ 25’, l9‘i78—T‘HE PITT NEWS‘--Page 5

Israeli Expansion and Palestinian Rights

question. The recent break in the
talks between Sadat and Begin was
over this very issue.

For three months Sadat attempt-
ed to create a peace settlement with
Israel. He found that Israel
continually talks about peace, but
when it comes to compromising,
which all nations involved in the
peace settlement will have to do,
she refuses to budge.

Israel refuses to recognize the
Palestinian people are a nation,
with a right to live as a nation. The
Israelis were willing to talk to

Egypt, Jordan and Syria, but one of '

the most basic issues in the
Mid-East is the Palestinian people.
They had hoped to negotiate a peace
with any of the established Arab
nations, but refused to acknowledge
the Palestinians as a nation. And

there is going to be no peace until
the Palestinians are given the right

to self-determination.
Throughout the talks,

once it is given back?

Even if Israel gives back the land

completely, removing all troops,

there will be no peace until a

Palestinian state exists. Now that
Sadat has stopped negotiating a
separate peace, let’s hope he will
rejoin the Arab nations and work
towards a peace for everyone in the
Mid-East, including the Palestin-
ians, which will put an end to Zionist
aggression. -

Marston's Highly Political Demise

One Democratic congressman
who is taking advantage of that
“in” to the White House is
P,hiladelphia’s Joshua Eilberg.
Marston, it seems, has been
investigating Eilberg and another
Pennsylvania Democrat, powerful
Congressman Daniel Flood. Since
Marston is two for two in nailing
state Democrats, both Eilberg and
Flood probably are reluctant to keep
Marston’s batting average up at
their expense.

Eilberg even called Carter to see
if the President could do something
about Marston. If Carter couldﬁnd
it in his big Southern heart to ﬁre

Marston, Eilberg would be very

happy. -

 

Carter called Bell and asked him
to “expedite” Marston’s removal.
At a press conference two weeks
ago, Carter denied doing any of this
until his memory was refreshed by
newsmen stunned to hear the
President deny something they
knew to be true.

A top aide to Bell has admitted
knowing Eilberg was under investi-
gation as long as two months ago.
Calling Bell and asking him to act on
Marston while Eilberg was being
investigated puts Carter danger-
ously close to committing obstruct-
ion of justice, a charge levied
against another President four
years ago.

. The man who recommends U.S.
attorneys to both Bell and the White
House, Associate Attorney General
Michael Egan, has implied publical-
ly there has been congressional
pressure to remove Marston.

“There are_ a lot of Democratic
congressmen in eastern Pennsyl-
vania,” he said. “A lot of
Democrats think we won the
election, and we should have a U.S.
attorney who is a Democrat.”

Sure, and when a Republican is
elected President he can appoint
John Dean to the Supreme Court.

Carter has said Marston’s

replacement would be chosen
strictly on merit. Using a kind of
logic most associated with his
brother, Carter seems to think it is
proper to ﬁre one attorney for
political reasons as long as he hires
his successor on merit.

These types of incidents have the
possibility of occurring every time a
new President enters ofﬁce. Most
chief executives avoid ugly. and
embarrassing scenes by eliminating
the problem early and quickly.
Carter has been in ofﬁce over a year
now. As with his public defense of
Bert Lance before all the facts were
known, Carter’s timing is all wrong.
His knowledge of how Presidents
use power and influence people
again is shown to be lacking.

Both the Republicans and the
general public now are jumping at
the chance to take shots at Carter
and the latest crisis of his young
administration. More than 1,500
letters and telegrams have come
into the White House concerning
Marston’s removal, and as of last
week, only one favored the course of
action Carter is taking.

What we are left with are one
ﬁred attorney who probably will
become more popular‘ thanks to
Carter, two Pennsylvania represen-
tatives breathing easier now that
the sheriff has been run out of town‘
and a public still waiting for its
President to fulﬁll his campaign
promises.

What we also have left (and this is

the best part) is a President Who

seems intent on serving just one
term. He just might do it. too.

The Exploitation of Hubert H. Humphrey

By AN GELE ELLIS

Dead politician-heroes have been
used by living ones since Antony
eulogized Caesar. But even An-
tony’s graveside performance
seemed spontaneous in comparison
to the speeches made over the body
of Hubert Humphrey. And the
Romans who responded to Antony
were seemingly less jaded, and less
voyeuristic than the Americans
whose curiosity was fed by the
details of Humphrey’s demise.

The grisly, exploitative process
started with the announcement
Humphrey had cancer. Pictures of
the senator, looking increasingly
frail and childlike, appeared on the
front pages of many newspapers:

one showed him with a beaming
Jimmy Carter. There were frequent
bulletins on his health—“Humph-
rey Enters Hospital,” A “Humphrey
Receives Radiation Therapy,” even
“Cancer Inoperable, Doctors Say.”
The grotesque drama continued
with the blow-by-blow description
of Humphrey’s ﬁnal coma, the
long, televised funeral (replete
with more celebrities than a game
show and more bombast than a
soap opera) and the post-mortem
magazine spreads. The months of
brainwashing effectively provoked
a synthetic burst of love for good
old H.H.H. in many American
hearts.

One could argue that the
treatment of Humphrey’s illness‘

and death reﬂected the respect and
affection due to him and genuinely
felt for him. One also could argue
that Humphrey became an object
for the parasitic actions of
American politicians and the
necrophiliac impulses of the
American public, and that the
inflated details of his death did not
really satisfy the need for heroes or
for ‘events and emotions that
transcend the personal. Without
the calculated mourning wails.
Humphrey’s death might have
excited little more feeling than the
death of Sen. Lee Metcalf;

For heroes are created, de-
stroyed, then resurrectd. If

Humphrey, a buffoonish villian
during the l960’s again is a hero,

not just a victim of the National
Enquirer-style hype that currently
surrounds many “celebrities,” it is
an indication the direction of
American culture has changed.

The turbulence of the 1960’s is
forgotten in the benignity of the
Carter administration; the events
that contributed to Humphrey’s
loss of the 1968 presidential
election—the Chicago riots, the
Vietnam War—-are history.
Humphrey, unlike Lyndon John-
son, survived to become venerable,
and was canonized for his
endurance. A post-Watergate dis-
taste for power-grabbing also may
have put the Happy Warrior, the
perennial loser, into first place at

last. Or it could have been the
American tendency to root for the
underdog that made us mourn not a
triumphant leader, but a failing.
one; not a slain leader, but one
wasted by disease. (One is struck
by the difference between Humph-
rey’s death an John Kennedy's; the
latter, although exploited, did elicit
some real public grief.)

Hubert Humphrey may have
been a good man, but was he a great
one? D1dn’t the distastefulness of
the publicity surrounding his death
cheapen his character and accom-
plishments? If we insist on creating
heroes, why ‘not concentrate on
stars like Elvis, and leave men like
Humphrey alone?

Israel
refused to compromise on any of the
issues. It is a strange thing to talk
about giving land back, while you
continue to build on it. And if Israel '
wants peace, why is it necessary to
keep troops stationed in the Sinai

mine Bids for Govemorshlp
HARRISBURG——Lt. Gov. Ernest
Kline, hiding his time as the
number two man in Gov. Shapp’s

administration, shoots for top
billing in state government today
after seven years as a supporting
actor.

Kline takes the ﬁrst ofﬁcial step
toward center stage when he
announces his Democratic bid for
governor in three cities. But the
one-time Beaver Falls radio an-
nouncer has been polishing his lines
for some time.

The 48-year-old Kline, who
organized a fund-raising committee
last April for his gubernatorial run,
has been cast as governor’s
material since his inauguration in
1970.

Being lieutenant governor is no
automatic stepping stone to the
governor’s mansion. Only two
lieutenants have ascended to the
top executive office in the last
century.

But Kline, who became Demo-
cratic floor leader in 1967 just 33
months after he became a state
senator, is a darling of party
leaders.

He’s straightforward with an
untarnished record as a legislator,
and he knows state government
from the inside out. At one point, he
seemed a shoo-in for the party’s
nomination.

But a strange thing happened
after Shapp and Kline rolled to
landslide victories in 1969 and 1973.
As cabinet officials ran afoul of the
law, disenchantment with state
government grew.

Charges of scandals and corrup-
tion and an ill-fated bid for the
presidency sagged Shapp’s popu-
larity. Others seeking the
governor’s chair seized the oppor-
tunity to associate Kline with
Shapp’s problems.

And whether he likes to admit it
or not, Kline is in the position of
opening his campaign on the
defensive.

“I have to establish a clear
identity for myself. I have to
convince voters that in voting for me
they are not making a choice for or
against Milton Shapp,” Kline said
recently.

“That will take a great deal of
work,” he added.

“He’s part of that mess and he
can’t escape it,” said former
Auditor General Robert P. Casey,
the first Democrat to announce his
candidacy.

Smoking With the Pill a Hazard

WASHINGTON—Food and Drug
Commissioner Donald Kennedy
said yesterday the nation’s 3 to 4
million women who smoke
cigarettes and take birth control
pills should quit smoking or find
another method of contraception.

The message is simple, Kennedy
said: “If you take the pill, don’t
smoke. If you do smoke while on
the pill, you increase dramatically
your chances of suffering a heart
attack or stroke.” He added: “If
you must ‘smoke, find another‘

method of contraception.” ' /“

Kennedy said women who both
smoke and use the pill are 10 times
more likely to die of a heart attack
or other circulatory disorder than
women who neither smoke nor take
the pill.

Kennedy, a biologist, gave the
advice in announcing his agency
will require new, updated and more
informative brochures for women
who purchase the pill after April 3,
the day the new regulation takes
effect.

The brochure and shorter leaﬂet
summarizing medical information
about the pill in non-medical‘

language will carry a warning till.»

says:

“Cigarette smoking increases
the risk of serious adverse effects
on the heart and blood vessels from
oral contraceptive use. This risk
increases with age and with heavy
smoking, 15 or more cigarettes a
day, and is quite marked in women
over 35 years of age. Women who
use oral contraceptives should not
smoke.”

The warning will be the most
prominent ever displayed on
leaflets that pharmacists have been
required to distribute with oral
contraceptives since 1970.

The information the FDA cur-
rently requires manufacturers '4,
distribute with pill packets s'a-,1
women have an increased risk of
circulatory problems, including
potentially fatal blood clotting or
strokes. But it says most side
effects from the pill are not serious.

That information still will be
included, along with new advice
telling women not to use oral
contraceptives if they have had
blood clotting disorders, cancer of
the breast or sex organs. un-
explained vaginal bleeding, a
stroke. heart attack or angit” '°‘

pectoris. or if they suspect they
may be pregnant. ‘ ‘

Women also are strongly advised
not to take birth control pills if they
have scanty or irregular menstrual

They kept coming. Rapid-fire
machine gun blasts riddled their
bodies, spewing bloody froth onto
the darkened display windows.
They kept coming.

A white Harley roared up the
aisle and Blades stood up in_ the
sidecar, sweeping the air with his
sword, a machete strapped to his
leg in readiness: They were still
coming, closer, now on all sides.
Nothing but a bullet through the
head would stop them. “When
there’s no more room in hell...the
dead will walk the earth..." It is
the “Dawn of the Dead.”

This is the second movie in a
trilogy conceived by director
George Romero. “Night of the
Living Dead,” the first episode in
this threesome of horror-thriller
movies, was filmed in Evans City,
Pa. Now, “Dawn ofthe Dead” is in
production at a Pittsburgh area!
shopping mall, where much of the
action takes place.

Students will remember “Night
of the Living Dead” from high
school or earlier days. It has
become a classic horror ﬁlm, and
attracted a growing cult following.
Dead people up an about are
always good for some palpitation,
and in “Night” the zombies not
only had hot feet, but also an
insatiable hunger for the ﬂesh of
the living. The menace was
directed at only a few, but in
“Dawn of the Dead” the entire
country is under attack, and dead
folk are everywhere, as fear and
loathing snowball among the
living.

The story centers on four people,

unit and two from a television

Once Again, It’s Greek

“We haven’t reached a perfect
system yet,” Interfraternity Coun-
cil rush chairman Ezra Krieg said of
the Greeks’ current rush program.
“But we’re working toward it.”

Krieg and Pan-Hellenic rush
chairman Carol Thomas have had
their hands full attempting to
improve biannual'Greek rush this
year. But together they’ve come up
with some plans that could lend

trafﬁc helicopter. After ﬁnally
landing on a shopping mall roof,
they manage to secure a defensible
position in the mall, where the
living dead are wandering aim-
lessly throughout. Although the
four equip themselves with the
latest and best of everything the
mall has to offer from its shops, the
zombies are like satanic swarms of
flesh-eating locusts. What ensues
promises “Dawn of the Dead” will
be every bit in the tradition of
“Night of the Living Dead.”
Recently, the press was invited
out to meet the production people,
and purge any latent desires to be a
zombie. Our hosts were gracious
and patient in the face of an
abundance of penwielding writers.

 

A viking feast of wine and booze
and the lavish food spread kept an
unusual assortment of people
circulating: bikers, production
VIP’s, crewmen, friends and actors
mingled easily in the smoky
penthouse hotel suite, and this
friendly ambience carried over to
the set several hours later.

At ten p.m. the crew left to
prepare the mall. Shooting would
begin at 11:30 p.m. and run
through the night until the mall
reopened.

“Rolling Stone” writer Chet

Flippo was seated in front of ’

native and on a teaching fellowship
from Carnegie-Mellon University. I
couldn’t say exactly where Flippo
was from, but at that particular
time he just could have been dug
up: half his face resembled a
tomato red, the other half was
death gray. Savini and his makeup

knee knocking in theaters every-

more appeal to Pitt’s often-criti-
cized Greek system.

“IFC has made an attempt to
strengthen the rush system, ’ ’ Krieg,
said, “like rush cards, enforcing
deadlines, making it. harder for
people to join—the 50 people will
think a little harder when deciding
to join a fraternity or sorority
instead of making a snap decision.
That way, we’ll have people join
who want to join, instead of having
people join on a lark.”

The streets are alive with the sound of music and
considerable amounts of other £70339, as Greek Rush

begins at the frat houses.

As a result of trying to provide
information to perspective rushees
(those who take an active interest in
the Greek system), in the scant
three-week rush period, Krieg and
Thomas worked together to provide
things like a reception Jan. 10 in the
Student Union Ballroom for all
interested students entitled “A
Birds-Eye View of the Greek
System,” the first joint effort
reception between IFC and Pan-
Hel.

‘ ‘There were some positive points
and some negative points about the
reception,” Krieg explained. “On
the positive side,-we had almost 100
percent participation of the Greek
system. The ballroom setup was
nice—it was a very showy thing,
with a free band from Aquarian
Associates, and the publicity helped
signal that rush was beginning.

“On the negative side, we didn’t
get the turnout of possible
rushees we had hoped for—that had
a lot to do with timing,” said Krieg.
Second-term rushees seem to feel
they don’t have to look at the
different -groups, that they’ve seen
them already during ﬁrst-term
rush. But in reality, second-term
rushees should get input from every

group—joining a fraternity or
sorority is a big decision.”

To help make that big decision,
the respective rush committees
have constantly made changes in
informing the rushee about Greek
life.

“We took ideas from previous
years, and added a few good ideas
of our own,” Krieg said. “We
designed information packets for all
rushees, and are planning to print a
handbook and master calendar for
the fall term to increase communi-

hand and a somewhat twisted
imagination, one can do damage to
a pretty face with a little
mortician's wax and some manu-
factured blood.

By the time my transformation
had taken place, the night’s ﬁlming
was under way. Viewers may
recognize one of the principle
actors, David E-mge, from his many
appearances at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. Local filmmaker Lenny
Lies, working on the produciton
crew, has his moment when he is
dropkicked by a zombie gets a
machete imbedded in his head.
And would any chapter in the
zombie trilogy be complete without
a tap-dancing zombie in knee socks
and leotards?

Pittsburgh-based director Ro-
mero, already acclaimed by critics
and public for his black and white
“Night of the Living Dead,” had
teamed up with Italy's Dario
Argento to create “Dawn of the
Dead” in color. Argento’s “Suspi-
ria" is currently appearing in U.S.
theaters. Producer Richard Rubin-
stein is Romero’s long-time partner
in The Laurel Group, lnc., a
multi-media production company

that has produced feature motion_

pictures, TV documentaries and
‘variety shows. They have also
arranged for the publication of
books by authors as diverse as
Anthony Burgess and Dick Gre-
gory. St. Martin’s Press will
publish the novel, “Dawn of the
Dead,” co-written by Romero and

Susanna Sparrow, in June. Sho‘ot- ’

ing for the movie began in early
November and is expected to wind
up in mid-February. The U.S.
release is expectd in early summer,
after the movie opens in Europe in
late spring.

cation between the individual Greek
groups and the rush committee, and
the rush committee and interested
rushees.”

Whether or not these ideas will
become tradition depends upon the
changing rush groups.

“Every rush committee comes up
with its own suggestions,” Krieg
said. “But I’m sure the rush cards,
information packets and master
calendar will carry on. The
reception probably will carry on. It

in plenty of time, but his car
stopped along the way to help
people with driving problems from
the weather.

At about the time Shapp was due
at the Capitol, the radar unit timed
it traveling at 74 m.p.h. During a
pursuit of about 15 miles, the car
was traveling at 90, police said.

“My driver was doing what he
thought should be done to get me
to Harrisburg in time for the press
conference,” Shapp said.

When Shapp ﬁnally arrived in
Harrisburg about 30 minutes late.
he said his car had been tied up in
traffic.

When word of the matter leaked
out, Deputy Commissioner Lt. Col.
George Evan called for a depart-
mental investigation. The investi-
gating trooper could be subject to
departmental discipline.

Under state law, the fine for
going 74 m.p.h. is $73. For doing
90, it’s $105.

“Our departmental attitude is
that the speed law should be
obeyed by everyone. And that
doesn’t mean just some people,”
said state police spokesman James
Cox.

“But here you have the chief
executive OffiC€I‘ of the state sitting
in the car. What would you do? You
can see the horns of a dilemma,"
Cox added.

By The Associated Press

Gov. Shapp has a red face after
his white Lincoln was clocked going
like a blue streak on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Shapp said Tuesday that a state
trooper made a mistake in failing to
give his driver a speeding ticket,
and that he made a mistake in not
telling the driver to do so.

“I feel embarrassed about the
whole thing,” Shapp said after his
car was clocked going 74 m.p.h. by
a radar unit Monday, and later at
90 m.p.h. by a pursuit car.

The turnpike speed limit is 55.
But Shapp’s driver, Trooper
Anthony Diguglielmo of the state
police, did not receive a citation.
The investigating trooper was not
named, pending a departmental
investigation.

“The trooper looked in the back
and saw me. And I guess he was
remiss in not giving me a ticket,”
said Shapp, who added he was
unaware his car was going past the
speed limit.

“I’m remiss for not saying to the
trooper that he should have given
me a ticket, but I understand his
dilemma,” the governor added.

Shapp was en route from his
home in Merion to a news

conference in Harrisburg.. He left

Br

Marcel Marceau, world famous
pantomimist, has won the hearts of
people in many countries without
uttering a single word or sound.
Inspired at the age of ﬁve by
Charlie Chaplin on the silent
screen, Marceau remained unsur-
passed in the art of mime in a
sellout performance in Heinz Hall
Sunday.

While illustrating a character or

\___

some aspect of life, Marceau
captured the essence of the world
around him. He became not just a
lone man on stage, but a part of a
world.

In “The Amusement Park”
(introduced on presentation cards
by the head of Marceau’s Interna-
tional School of Mime, Pierre Verry
on presentation cards), Marceau
was seen as a mechanical doll
transformed into a merry-go-
round. His change from one aspect
to another was ﬂuid and smooth as
he depicted the paranoia of being
lost in a funhouse maze. Feeling

his way along the wall, he searched
for the way out, adding humor to

: 7 ‘Page 1o—‘”rm: PITT-=NI«:ws—wednesaay, January 25-, 1973

 E Marceau Brings Silence To Its Highest   Level   .é;;;;

the exercise by bumping into a
wall.

The ﬁrst half of the program was
all style exercises, as Marceau
imitated different types of people
acting in different ways. But
Marceau’s gestures seemed to go
further than imitations—they es-
tablished a feeling, a story, a
moral. The visible expressions
were plain to see, but Marceau
went beyond the visible.

In “The Angel,” Marceau
became a confused rebel angel who
had the ways of men. With an
ethereal choir of singing voices in
the background, he stretched out
his arms like wings, and was
caught in the storm of man’s
consciousness. The music changed
into a robust gypsy dance as the
tempted angel fell to the evils that
brought the fall of man: gluttony,
liquor, gambling, and ﬁghting.

Each vice materialized before the
audience in the simple, expressive
Marceau style. The choir returned
as God called the angel back, but
the fallen angel could not decide. It
is man’s consciousness versus
temptation.

Marceau is for a select audience.
One must appreciate the art of
mine, and have an open, imagina-
tive mind, for mime needs
‘complete attention in order to

presentation of the classics—“The
Mask Maker,” “The Public Gar-
dens,” “The Painter,”—one no-
tices Marceau’s wit as he satires
different types of people, common
but unseen by the dull eye.

The second half of the perfor-
mances consisted of Bip (a
Chaplin-like character and trade-
mark of Marceau’s) in various
situations. Created by Marceau in
1947, Bip appeared with a white
painted face, the eyes and mouth
emphasized with dark outlines. He
was a clown in a striped pullover,
tight pants, and a beflowered hat.

In one adventure, “Bip Looks for
a Job,” Marceau went through
different jobs, from violinist to
opera. At last, Bip resorted to
door-to-door panhandling, keeping
an arm in a sling for sympathy.
Turned down, Bip tried one more
time and ﬁnally found a sympathe-
tic donor. But in gratitude, Bip
thanked the donor using the
“broken" arm, and his Charade
ends.

Marceau uses Bip as a means to
show not only the outward
appearance of man, but also the
inside, the conscience, and man’s
passions. This was done when Bip,
having no money, gives the last of
his food to hungry dogs at his feet.

Though Bip is only one charac-
ter, Marceau manages to place him
in misadventures that become

 

comical and boundless. Bip travels
by train, commits suicide, becomes
a soldier and imitates David and

For a good laugh, look at the
newspaper for “Semi-Tough,” the
newly released comedy that has
been hyped as a superb spoof of the

glamorous world of successful
professional football players.

In the ad, the stars of the ﬁlm,
macho Burt Reynolds and bland and
bearded Kris Kristofferson, are
shown in their football jerseys,
poised and smiling, awaiting the
sexual snap from center from a line
of ﬁve buxom, bikini-clad beauties.

Okay, if the world’s greatest

After seeing ‘ ‘ Semi-Tough, ’ ’ that

“Family” Brings Honesty To Television

By RON N YSWANER
Pitt News Staff Writer
Among the institutions ‘deified by television—from the
police officer’s squad car to Lucille Ball—the family is the
most enduring. From “Father Knows Best” to “The

' Waltons,” mothers, fathers and children have provided the

cast of characters for situation comedies and situation
tragedies. _

The television family was once rather stable. In “Father
Knows Best” Jim and Margaret Anderson happily passed on
the wisdom of adulthood to Princess, Bud and Kitten,
teaching them honesty is the best policy, giving is better than
receiving (in the long-term sense, of course), and seltldenial is
good for the soul. I remember one episode in which Betty
(Princess), determined to be the only girl in the high school
surveying class, found romance instead, and transferred back
to Home Ec. As the show ended, Margaret commented: “It’s
so nice to see Betty wearing a dress again.’’

An, nostalgia: party dresses, backyard barbeques and firm,
consistent values. Then came, of course, the l960’s to
challenge every value anyone held dear. Should we fight in a
war? Should we make a revolution? Should we wear shoes?
And, ultimately, should we continue to shape our society
around the nuclear family?

Remember.television in the late l960’s and early l970’s?
There were no married couples, only widows and divorcees.
Of all the single parent shows, only one—Bill Bixby’s “The
Courtship of Eddie’s Father”—ever considered the problems
a parent must face in singularly raising a child. For the rest,
the family meant as much to the scripts as good taste means to
“The Gong Show.”

Then CBS became lucky and, to everyone’s surprise, “The
Waltons” became a hit. Amid chickens, quilting bees and
hyphenated names (.iolm—Boy, iim-Bob) oc<.a«:i-:inail_\‘
emerged sensitive. scripts about ordinary (and ye~r._.
wholesome) people, growing, but most of all :;ur\*ix*i:i_g.
There may be tragedy on ‘~.\’aitoi:’x fxviotintaiii toriigiiv, but you
know that the family lives on: John and Olivia, the kids, the
old folks and the dogs will still be there in the morning.

But “The Waltons”’ is set in the 1930’s, a time when, like
the l950’s, people seemed sure of what they were struggling
for or fighting against. Can you imagine anyone on Walton’s
Mountain liking Nazis? As the narrator sums up each
episode, there is a sense that the security of his childhood
home belongs to a simpler age. I can almost _hear him say:
“Those were the days.”

The sense that our families, and our country as well, have
lost some essential consistency gives the “Waltons” its
emotional power. “The Waltons” may be sensitive and
intelligent, but it is often sensitive and intelligent nostalgia.

“The Waltons” has spawned a series of family shows:
“James at l5,” and “Eight Is Enough” among them. ABC’s
“Family,” the best of all, is almost a modern day
“Waltons.”

“Family’s” family are the Lawrences, who live ‘in a Los
Angeles suburb. ' Mr. Lawrence (James Broderick) is a
lawyer; Mrs. Lawrence (Sada Thompson) is a music student.
They have three children: Nancy, Willy and Buddy (a modern
answer to Princess, Bud and Kitten?) and a grandson,
Timmy, by Nancy, who is divorced.

All the Lawrences, in the best television tradition, ha\7e
faced minor and major crises. Timmy has come near to
death, Nancy has been threatened by a peeping Tom, Willy is
a widower at 20, Buddy grew breasts, Mrs. Lawrence
delivered a baby and Mr. ‘Lawrence almost slept with a
woman other than his wife.

-In the hands of intelligent writers and actors, the crises in
“Family” becomes mere outlines upon which to hang each
episode. “Family” is really about how the Lawrence’s are
changed by their personal tragedies or near-tragedies. Like
“The Waltons,” the Lawrences survive and push on. The
family as an institution can/be shaken, but never broken.

This enduring na:t.=.re of the faniiiy in television .‘iisrory goes

world, exposing it as a shallow and

neurotic characters are the rule
rather than the exception.

The prime neurotic is Reynolds, a
star running back for Dallas, who is
grasping for something more than
his jock life has provided him.

Reynold’s roommate and fellow
Texan is the unexciting Kris
Kristofferson, the team’s split end
and one of the biggest problems of
“Semi-Tough.”

While Reynolds plays himself,
the mugging, macho, jovial buffoon
we have come to accept and enjoy,
Kristofferson mopes around with a
hound-dog face and laid-back
demeanor.

“Semi-Tough” also features Jil ;
Clayburgh as the spoiled, little rich _ ‘

girl daughter of the team owner
(Robert Preston).

Clayburgh’s platonic relationship
with Kristofferson and Reynolds is
spoiled when she decides to marry
Kristofferson.

The ﬁlm then shifts from-Dallas’
preparation for the Super Bowl to
Reynold’s jealousy over the affair
between Clayburgh and Kristoffer-
son.

Of the trio, only Reynolds is

' effective, managing to salvage most
. of the ﬁlms’s comic scenes.

Clayburgh’s to Kristofferson will
be her third; hehooks up with a
dapper guru (Bert Convy), who runs
a self-improvement gimmick called
BEAT (Basic Energy Assertive
Training). BEAT teaches you are
“it,” and that power lies in
believing you are the greatest thing
since sliced bread. ~

When Kristofferson tries to talk
Clayburgh into getting “It,” the
film shifts to spoof consciousness-
raising.

Reynolds decides to con every-
body into believing that he too has '

In another scene, Reynolds is
subjected to a riotus session of
muscle torture by a sweet,
60-year-old woman masseuse.

Their are several sex scenes in
the ﬁlm, but they are hardly
explicit, and nowhere near as
prominent as the misleading ad
suggests.

Dan Jenkins, the Sports Illustrat-
ed writer on whose novel “Semi-
Tough” was based, supposedly is
happy with how the ﬁlm has turned
out.

Most people, however, won’t be.
“Semi-Tough” presents nothing
new in the way of satire.

Football players have always
been presented as lacking brains,
and most people realize the majority
of consciousness-raising fads are
proﬁt-making vehicles.

“Semi-Tough” just reinforces
these cliches.

“Family” --A Realistic Portrait

/(um'zr.1wr///'r2H/ /‘(mt /(I),

traditions, showing us why the family, in spite of the myths,
really does endure. For Jim and Margaret Anderson, the
family really did endure. The family and other institutions,
like policemen (and they were men), housewifery and
religious faith, were intrinsically good. The family was
inherently stable and benevolent. But Jim and Margaret
Anderson didn’t live through -Charles Manson and
Watergate. The writers of “Family” have seen revered
institutions (like the Presidency) fall fast. They know we
cling to tradition for tradition’s sake, and that the best part of
any ritual is often the ritual itself.

In the Christmas show, Willy (Gary Frank) insisted On
decorating a Christmas tree, even though Timmy was gravely
ill. Buddy (Kristy McNicholl) could not understand how
Willy could hang balls on a tree when their nephew was dying

in a hospital. Willy replied, “Being in this family at
Christmas means having a Christmas tree.” Willy is not
particularly religious, but he knows a Christmas tree is one of
his famil_v’s bedrock traditions. The family does not maintain
the ritual. The ritual helps maintain the family.

In turn, the family is maintained by the choice of its
members, rather than by some natural nesting instinct parents
and children share. The family in “Family” continues becuse
it is often all that is left to the Lawrences when husbands
leave, wives die, and friends get angry. Because they love
each other, they live with each other. Because they make
room for individual change, because Willy can marry a
terminally ill woman even if his parents vehemently
disapprove, because Kate Lawrence can realize that raising
children, cooking dinner, and playing Mozart on the piano is
not enough for her complete happiness, the family will
continue. This family’s stability is the room it makes for
change and growth.

“Family” allows its characters the freedom of not being
sure. In a recent episode, Willy thought he loved the former
roommate of his deceased wife. He even slept with her, not

sure that he loved her. The woman was hurt by Willy’s
confusion. In “Family,” good people like Willy can be
wrong, and being wrong canlbe painful.

No one is too sure about anything in “Family,” even
marriage and family life itself. Nancy (Meredith Baxter
Birney) is happily divorced. Buddy’s best friend Audrey,
whose parents are divorcing, has learned that some
relationships are not good forever. Even that old unassailable
standby~—heterosexuality—is not an intrinsically valid
institution in “Family.” In two episodes, gay people have
been shown as (drum roll, please...) happy and well—adjusted.
Buddy was asked by her mother if she thought she might be
gay. Buddy was able to say: “No, I don’t think so.” In its
treatment of homosexuality alone, “Family” stands above
nearly anything similar ever done in television or film. See,
for example, the current film, “Looking For Mr. Goodbar,”
for a quite different treatment.

Of course, the Lawrences’ problems are resolved by the end
of an hour; someone always knows the best solution to
someone else’s problem, and waits to be proven right. These
are the conventions of hour—long television shows. “Family”
is fascinating because it challenges what other instances of the
same genre have only substantiated.

Amid talk of new options for liberated men and women,

new kinds of relationships between parents and children and

the creation of new social groups (remember “bridging the
generation gap” and communes?) “Family” offers an old
institution with a new heart. Intellectual snobs who refuse to
watch television (except Public Broadcasting) may be
surprised to find this mass medium has produced a potential
model for a new kind of family, one that cultivates new values
rather than passing on tired old ones, one that allows parents
and children to conflict and confront each other and still be
tied together.

“Family” asserts that real security exists in individual
growth, and loving an individual for that growth. Father
doesn’t always know best anymore. But then, did he ever?

Michael Rice Abandons Panther Lah-

ClNCINNATl—Where Tim Grgurich’s Panthers
are, other than between Cincinnati and Cleveland:

They are, it has been confirmed, without Michael
Rice. Rice, 6-8, who as a freshman last season saved
a 6-21 team from further embarrassment by
providing its only consistent play underneath, has
left Pitt after three terms that left him academically
ineligible for what would have been his second year
of play. .

Rice apparently grew disenchanted with Pitt’s

program during the first few weeks of this season, in
which Pitt suffered several inexplicable losses and
appeared to be headed toward another season to
forget. Rice told a reporter early in December that he
planned to transfer; Grgurich believed he had a
chance to keep Rice as much as a month later, when
he told another writer, “Michael will be back with us
next year-” _

Where Rice will be next year is uncertain. Rice,
who has lived in Frederick, Md., has expressed an
interest in the University of Maryland. Grgurich said
Monday night that Rice might attempt to play for a
junior college. '

Rice averaged 10.6 points and eight rebounds per
game last season. He led the team in rebounding and
was third, behind Larry Harris and Sonny Lewis, in
scoring...

Panthers have found one in Sam Clancy. Clancy, in
his freshman season, is about as green as your
average fire truck. That analogy extends also to
Clancy’s leaping ability, since he can get up about as
high as a hook-and-ladder might.

 

Among Clancy’s victims in the Center-jump circle
have been Ralph Drollinger (7-2), Roosevelt Bouie
(the 6-1 1 “candidate” for all-America who scored all
of two points against Clancy), Joe Barry Carrol (7-0)
and, most recently, Bob Miller (6-10). Bouie also was
awarded another distinction by Clancy. For standing
in’ front of Clancy while Pitt’s 6-6 strongman
descended for a dunk, Bouie was given a Purple
Wrist. The presenter, of course, was Clancy.

At least a half dozen pro scouts were at courtside
of the Pitt-Cincinnati game. Each had cards with the
names Larry Harris, Bob Miller and Pat Cummings

iWednesday, January 25, l978—THE PITT NEWS-—Page 13

for Parts Unknown

somewhere near the top. Soon after Clancy began
his 7-for-9 assault on the basket, however, most
began scribbling on the back of at least one of their
cards—when they weren’t busy staring at Clancy...

Several scouts said complimentary things about
Harris, though 6-for-13 from the field wasn’t what
they came to see him accomplish. His agressiveness,
long considered a weak point, is “improving,”
according to one scout, and the consensus on Harris
was that he would be a second-round pick. Miller
was put in roughly the same league...

Ed Scheuermann has had games in which he has
scored more than nine points and had more than
eight rebounds, but never has he given Pitt a better
performance than he did in Cincinnati.
Scheuermann’s improvement in the past month has
been as steady as it has been marked, and he has
earned his place in the regular lineup. He wasn’t
ready for the tough stuff underneath when he came
to Pitt, but he is now...

Though it’s certain any of the Pitt basketball
players (or local sportswriters) who have had
occasion to visit Cleveland would have it_otherwise, it
is fact that tonight’s game with Cleveland State will
be played on the banks of Lake Erie and not at the
Field House, as some printed schedules would advise
you...

But as surely as Pitt has lost a good big man, the

CINCINNATI——As they have
done more times than Tim Grgurich
would care to recall, Pitt Panthers
played like winners here Monday
night-—-until it came time to win.

After losing a 12-point lead by
halftime, the Panthers spent 19
minutes and 42 seconds doing what
was necessary to beat a team such
as Cincinnati (10-5), in a place such

as Cincinnati (where the Bearcats .

have been 71-2 lately). Pitt shot 62
percent from the ﬁeld, but missed
enough foul shots and.committe’d
enough turnovers to allow a
last-second 25-foot jump-and-pray
shot by Bearcat reserve Greg
Johnson, which sent the game into
an overtime period in which Pitt had
little chance.

That the game went into overtime
was in many ways surprising to the
4,004 persons watching what had
been advertised as agrudge match
(the grudge was property of Bearcat
coach Gale Catlett) at Riverfront
Coliseum.

Pitt, riding the shooting of Sam
Clancy (12 of 14), the defense of
Wayne Williams (5 steals) and an

_ ' impressive performance by 6-11 Ed
J’ » cheuermann, had not surrendered

the lead since an early 6-4

Cincinnati advantage. The Panther

leads, at times, were impressive.
With ﬁve minutes remaining in

' the first half, Pitt led by 12. But the

“You don’t have to have an
article in the paper to know you’ve
had a good match,” 150-pound Pitt
wrestler Ed Bredniak said, after a
10-6 victoryiover Lehigh’s Joe
Hockman in the E-ngineers’ 21-12
win last Saturday. “When you go
out and do a good job you know it,
the fans know it and the team
knows it."

What has been unknown is
Bredniak’s personal record—7-3,
including a four-match unbeaten
streak against Buffalo, Bucknell,
Temple and Lehigh that he_ will
have a chance to extend against the
Millersville Marauders tomorrow
night at 7:30 p.m. at Fitzgerald
Field House.

“I don't consider myself over-

points,. a questionable tap-in at the
buzzer tying the game.

Based largely on Terry Knight’s
shooting was the eight-point margin
Pitt had mustered by the time seven
minutes remained in regular play.
But Pitt blew that lead in little more
than 90 seconds. It was 64-64 with
ﬁve minutes left. The Bearcat fans,
remembering the first half’s ﬁnal
ﬁve minutes, watched the Panthers’
throats carefully.

But a pair of lay-ins by Clancy
gave Pitt four-point leads, the
second of which remained on the
scoreboard until Keith Hemans,
another Cincy sub, hit a 20-foot
jumper with but 18 seconds
remaining between Pitt and a win.

The last 60 seconds of a game
always seem to consume the better
part of an evening when Pitt is
involved, but, if anyone had reason
to worry Monday night, he was from
Cincinnati. The Panthers called a
timeout when it was appropriate,
broke a Cincy press when they had
to, andeven drew fouls when that
appeared to be a wise thing to do.

It went so far that Pitt managed to
come as close to a four-corner
offense as can be accomplished
without guards.

But Cincinnati, a better than
average representative of a better
than average conference (Metro
Seven), handled the pressure when
Pitt could not. When Pitt missed
three foul shots at the end, the
Bearcats worked for a decent shot as
the last six seconds moved them
closer to defeat.

looked," Bredniak said. “I think
there’s quite a few guys in the team
with good talent—+more talent than
myself.”

The improving Panthers (4-3)
showed what talent they had
Saturday, coming from a 9-0 deficit
to take a short 12-9 lead against the
14th-ranked Engineers (6-6).

“We did a real good job with the
team we had," Bredniak claimed.
“We were without Rande
Stottlemyer (134 pounds) and Bill
Bailey_(190 pounds), and the losses
we had were not big losses—4-1,
3-2. Everybody wonders how we
would have done with Rande and
Bill in the lineup. It would have

been real nice if we were
healthy—we'd have hada hell of a
good shot ”

But the upset didn’t happen» and

 

With a second remaining,
Johnson took a lengthy pass in the
right ﬂat. ‘ ‘I just turned around and
prayed,” the Cincinnati freshman
said. “It’s the kind of shot you
dream of making all the time when
you’re a kid, but it only goes in
once.”

Once was enough for Cincinnati;
it also was sufﬁcient to send Pitt to
its sixth loss, via an overtime in
which Cincinnati made 11 free
throws.

Grgurich, who has aged much for

the better recently and who no
longer can be considered University
scapegoat when Jackie Sherrill is
not in season, recognized both the
strengths and weaknesses of the
lineup and game plan into which he
has settled after several season
marked by unusual——-and usuallyh
less than helpful—tactics.

“We felt we were as good as
Cincinnati, and for 39 minutes and
10 seconds we just outplayed
Cincinnati,” he said. “When you

Bredniak’s Record Has Not Bred Recognition

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt will have to keep its hopes for
national recognition alive by
constantly winning, especially
against challengers like
Millersville.

“They beat us last year, 22-20,
but we’re just not going to let that
happen again,” Bredniak said.
“They're a very competitive team,
but we're a different team this
year. Last year, everybody depend-
ed on a few guys—Bailey, (Mark)
Stepanovich. But this year, every-
body's been taking a little of the
pressure. Everybody's been taking
a shot, and winning when
needed."

Bredniak will be needed tomor-
row to quash the Marauders’ (a
good Division II team) enthusiasm
for beating a Division I opponent
like Pitt.

“Last week, I didn’t feel too
well—I had a touch of the flu— but
I still plan on wrestling,’ Bredniak
explained. “Against Lehigh, I
might not have been 100 percent,
but Ithink I did okay. I might not
be 100 percent against Millersville,
but I can go out on the mat for eight
minutes and suck it in.”

Bredniak “sucks it in” every
match, due to knee operations last
season to remove calcium deposits.

“I wouldn't classify. it as
serious," Panther head coach Dave
Adams said, “but it will bother him
the rest of his wrestling career.
He’ll have to be mentally tough,
and tolerate the pain he exper-
iences most every time he’s on the
mat. But he's-very determined-
he’s a good competitor, and, with

come down to the end of the game,
it’s up to you. It’s a shame that our
ballclub plays good games, but
comes out short at the end.

“With Wayne (Williams), Larry
(Harris) and Terry (Knight) in
there,” he added, “we’re going to
make turnovers.” But, ‘though
Sonny Lewis was the first substitute
and more players saw more action
than had been the case last week,
Grgurich seems prepared to
continue with his “big” lineup.

With that decision comfortably
behind"him, it would appear that all
Tim Grgurich (and his players) need
are a few wins, now that they’ve
convinced everyone they can
compete with even the best of their
opponents.

PITT NOTES—Ed Scheuermann
played 43 minutes, many of them
against 6-11 Bob Miller, and
performed well enough to warrant
congratulations from a Bearcat
player who had not thought so
highly of him after last year’s
game...Knight’s 18 points and
Harris’ 15 followed Clancy’s
team-leading 24 for Pitt...Miller’s
15 led Cincy, which had six players
in double ﬁgures...

Catlett, facing a split crew, didn’t
receive as many calls as a home
coach could desire. In fact, the calls
were in Pitt’s favor more often than
not...Clancy had 12 rebounds,
Scheuermann and Miller each
ﬁnished with eight...

that injury, that’s really paying off
for him.”

MAT NOTES:

Millersville doesn't have a
wrestler in their starting lineup
who has lost more than two
regular-season bouts...the most
interesting matchup is at 134
pounds, where NCAA Champion-
ship participant Andy Zook (6-0)
will meet Jackie Kline (1-1,
including one pin), who will
substitute for flu-hampered
Stottlemyer. . .Bailey, recovering
from a knee injury suffered at the
prestigious ‘Wilkes Christmas
Tournament, may start at 190
pounds for the first time in
1978. _

Pantherettes Extend Streak; Demolish Towson

_ YSJIUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

In their best showing of the
season, the Pantherette basketball
squad upped its winning streak to

"three Saturday by demolishing
Towson State College, 87-59.

The rescheduled game was
played in Trees Hall rather than on
the familiar Field House court, but
the changeover didn’t seem to
matter to Pitt. The Pantherettes
displayed their usual offensive
strength, but tagged on a ﬁne
defensive game. ‘

‘ ‘It was the bestwe’ve played for
40 minutes this season,” said coach
Jean Balthaser. “Previously we’ve
had good ﬁrst halves or strong
offensive showings, but this time
the defense was outstanding. We
were a different team tonight.”

Balthaser cited center Wanda
Randolph for her “super” playing.

‘ ‘Wanda was excited about being
in the game,” she said. “She ran on
the fast breaks and hustled.”

Randolph scored 16 points and

Mudrick photo

grabbed 15 rebounds in the victory,
while also blocking four shots.
Another plus for the offensive
department was Debbie Lewis, who
received a starting nod for the ﬁrst
time this year. Despite some errant
passes, the 5-2 freshman scored 22
points in her usual ﬂashy style.
Barb Welsh turned in another
double-ﬁgure performance with 10
points. The 5-9 guard had an
uncanny way of being in the right
place at the right time, and stole the
ball from Towson State six times.
The first half moved quickly as
Lewis ran the Pantherette offense at
point guard and spent much of her

‘ time running the distance of the I

court for fast-breaks.

Other starters Stephanie Stripl-
ing and Robin Fry were busy forcing
turnovers on defense.

At the 10-minute mark, Kathy
Paczowski and Dana Elder came in
for Lewis and Fry. The duo did a
good job of slowing down the
fast-paced game. The score at
halftime was 43-18.

A style has

KAREN KADILAK

fin News Staff Writer

Not since Billy Knight’s arrival
at Pitt six years ago has a
basketball player caused such a stir
as the one Sam Clancy has made
this season.

The muscular, 6-6, 230-pound
Clancy has arrived upon the Pitt

'» basketball scene in much the same

way as he plays basketball-—about
as subtle as a left hook to the jaw.

A disciple of the type basketball
played by Wilt Chamberlain nearly
20 years ago, and now practiced by
former Schenley star Maurice
Lucas, Clancy believes the best
way to get to the hoop is to drive
through the land and his oppo-
nents, and slam the ball through
the net with a rim-rattling dunk.

Not too much ﬁnesse, but a lot of
power—that’s the way Clancy
believes the game of basketball
should be played.

“I’m a ﬁrm believer in power
basketball,” Clancy said. “It’s the
way I was taught to play the game.
I used to watch Chamberlain play
the game, now, I watch Maurice
Lucas play the same way in pro ball
with Portland. In fact, Maurice (a
close friend of Clancy’s), has given
me some tips on how to play that
kind of game.

“I like that kind of game,” the
freshman continued. “It boils down
to my power against my opponent’s
power. It's the kind of game that
suits me and my build.”

Although Clancy’s slamming
delighted Pitt fans,
Clancy himself doesn’t get any
special satisfaction seeing one of
his well-executed dunk shots rip
through the net.

“To me itfs like a layup,” Clancy
said. “It’s like any other shot, but I

In the second half, Balthaser
went with her starting ﬁve, and
gradually worked in Mimi Senkow-
ski, Kit Loefﬂer, Paczowski, Elder,
Rita Rodriguez, Linda Lesnick and
Diane Zaken.

Balthaser used the word “in-
tense” to describe the playing of
her team and the Pantherettes will
need that kind of team effort
Tuesday, when they travel to Penn
State to battle the 14th-ranked
Lionettes.

PANTHERETTE NOTES:

Kim Raymond has ofﬁcially
been redshirted...Debbie Murray
sat out the game because of a pulled
leg muscle. She’ll be ready for
action on Tuesday. . .Peggy Dugan’s
kneewas operated on last week. She
should be playing by March...Dana
Elder injured her back slightly as
she drove to the basket during the
game...This, was the third straight
game in which every Pantherette
saw action.

Green weld Unaffected by Weather;
Dives into NCAA Competition

BYKARENKADILAK

‘Pitt News Staff Writer

While others were worrying

’ about the snow blanketing Pitts-

burghlast week, Panther diver Pat
Greenweld had his mind on other
things besides the latest weather
report.

A native of Tampa, Fla. by way of
Kiski Prep School, the freshman
isn’t accustomed to the kind of
weather characterizing recent win-
ters. Thursday at Trees Pool,
Greenweld was more worried about
making the three-meter dive
clinching him a berth in NCAA
pre-qualiﬁers at University Park in
March.

‘ ‘Cold is cold, and there's nothing
you can do about it,” Greenweld
said. ‘ ‘Sure, that dive made me feel

great, but the qualiﬁers are a long
way off, and we still have the season
to dive for. But you still can’t help
but think about them (the
qualiﬁers). ’ ’

Greenweld was the third Pitt
diver to qualify for the pre-qualif-
iers. Earlier this season, sopho-
more Scott Winkler and freshman
Chris Mano qualiﬁed in the 1-meter
diving competition.

Greenweld’ s entry in the prequal-
iﬁcation dives capped an impressive
ﬁrst-year performance for coach Al
Coffey’s diving team. Competing
with the swimming team, Green-
weld has helped the Panthers to
chalk up a 4-0 record.

“It has been a challenge for me,”
Greenweld said. ‘ ‘This Whole

about both of those meets.”

season has been an interesting
experience. That’s why I'm looking
forward to the pre-qualiﬁers in
March. I think it should be an
interesting way to top off my ﬁrst
year at school.”

In the meantime, Greenweld will
be thinking about a few more
pressing problems this week--Pitt’s
upcoming opponents, Maryland
and West Virginia. Saturday’s
meet against Maryland and the
competition at West Virginia a week
later are large obstacles to the
Panthers’ goal of an undefeated
season.

,“They’re going to be tough,”
Greenweld said. “Both are good
squads, and I’ve been thinking

know the fans really appreciate it.
If I were a fan, I would appreciate
it, too. The slam dunk is exciting.
It’s what the fans want to see.”

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich thinks
Pitt fans will be seeing the big
freshman take another kind of shot
in the coming years. Although the
top of the key jumper is less
exciting than one of Clancy’s power
dunks, Grgurich thinks Clancy can
be as effective with this shot as
he’s been with the other. For a big
man, Clancy has a ﬁne touch.

“Sammy has a good jumper,”
Grgurich said. “Offensively, Sam-
my’s still maturing, though. He's
been relying on the inside shot
more than the somewhat longer
shots, but as he gets accustomed to
the college game, you’re going to
see Sammy taking, say, those top
of the key jumpers.

“I’ve noticed him doing that
already,” Grgurich said. “He
turned around and popped in a few
of the soft turnaround jumpers
against Syracuse the other night.

‘.‘Sammy’s just one of those
players,” the Pitt coach continued,
“who prefers driving the ball in
rather than going outside more and
shooting the ball. He’ll always be
that type of player. You get players
like that; guys who would rather
shoot underneath the hoop.”

As power-orientated as Clancy is
on the court, he’s just as gentle off
it. Clancy admits to “having a
simple lifestyle.” Sleeping _and
talking basketball areitwo of his
favorite interests.

In fact, the talks Clancy and his
mother conduct after basketball
games in his family’s home in the
Hill District have helped Clancv
through his freshman season.

Powerful Stir       

“She’s a big basketball fan,”
Clancy said. “She started following
the sport when I was playing high
school ball. I can hear her during
our home games shouting instruc-
tions and that. She can be helpful
at times. She really understands
the sport now.

“You can ask her any question
about a college, or high school
player and she’ll probably know the
answer to it,” Clancy said. “She’s
a great basketball fan.”

There has been much talk lately
that Clancy will follow other Pitt
basketball players who left school
early to play professional basket-
ball as hardship cases. But Clancy
dismisses it as talk.

“No way,” the former all-State
basketball and football all-America
(Clancy made the all-America team
as a junior offensive tackle in high
school) said.

“My mother and I have
discussed it,” Clancy said. “She
doesn’t want me to turn pro. She
enjoys watching me play basketball
too much at Pitt for me to even
want to leave. Playing basketball at
Pitt has made it convenient for her
to follow me’ and my basketball
career. I want my mother to follow
my career as long as possible.

“She’s meant a lot to me,”

— Clancy said. “My whole family's

been behind me. My father, my
aunts are all backing me. My
friends tell me ‘turn pro, the
money’s good.’ Well, that doesn’t
fascinate me right now. I have the
opportunity to get a college
education, and that’s what I want.

“I pride myself of having a good
head on my shoulders,” Clancy
continued. “l just don’t think it
would be a wise move to turn pro.
Not yet-.”

A Portrait

On August 28, 1963, millions of Americans watched and heard
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. awaken the consciousness of a

Freedom. His historicrefrain beginning ‘‘I have a dream”, and
‘ending with the words that would one day mark his grave, “Free
at last, tree at last, thank God Almighty I’m free at last”,
became a spiritual cry enlightening an America possessed by
bigotry and racial shame.
