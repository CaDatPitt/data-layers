Students For Peace Group
Retain Campus Recognition

. By VICKI EPSTEIN
Students for Peace maintained their status as a rec-

ognized campuslorganization and received their $52.50 activ-
ities fee allocation, because of insufficient evidence sub-

FOLK music set the tone of
Wednesday night"s Sing-in for
Peace. -

stantiating alleged violations of a Pitt Preview rule last _

weekend. The charges were to be presented before the Com-
mittee on the Recognition of Student Organizations Wednes-

day, but the meeting was can-
celled and an informal settle-
ment negotiated.

At Pitt Preview last week, Stu-
dents for Peace distributed leaf-
lets describing the International
Days of Protest. William Weber,
president of Students for Peace,
said, “Students for Peace was not
soliciting for membership. All
available means of publicity was
being used including distribution
of literature at Carnegie Institute
of Technology, Duquesne Univer-
sity, and high schools through-
out Pittsburgh.”

On Monday, the Vice-Chancei-
lor for Student Affairs Helen P.
Rush delayed Students for Peace’s
allocation until investigating
whether or not it was affiliated
with Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and if SDS was a
subversive organization.

when it became a recognized
student organization approximate-
ly six weeks ago, Students for

’ Peace stated that it might work

with other groupsincluding SDS,
according to Weber.

President of Student Govern-
ment Ralph Manning investigated
and found through United States
government sources that SDS is
not subversive. With this infor-
mation the meeting of the Com-
mittee on the Recognition of Stu-
dent Organizations scheduled for

G/lives ‘Glimpse’ of University.

   

ARLENE TOPEL and Bill Skeegan prepare to meet their group of

high school seniors coming to’ the University for Pitt Preview.

‘ ‘Visiting high school seniors’

will meet with University hosts
and hostesses tomorrow at_ Pitt
Preview. The aim of the Preview
is to present a pigure of Univer-
sity life to prospective freshmen.

After the 9_ to 9:30 a.m. meet-
ing of the high school students
with their hosts, a brief program
will be presented in the Stephen
Foster Memorial. Jim Smith, In-
ter-Fraternity Council Man of the
Year, and Dr. James Kehl, dean»
of the School ‘of Liberal Arts, will.
to 11130 a.m..

20 different scheduled classes. A
lunch with the University stu-
dent body will follow.

Afternoon ‘activities will take
place from 1:30 to 4 in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom. After greet-
ings by Barbara Elman, chair-
man of Pitt Preview, and Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Helen P. Rush, emcee Danny
Katz will introduce the program.

These groups" scheduled to per- .

form are the ‘Men's Glee Club,

after which there will be a dance
from 4 to 5:30 pm. in the Ball-
room. Pan-Hellenic and Inter-

sponsor the dance. R

For the parents of the high‘
school students there will be‘ a
coffee hour from 10 to'10:30 a.m.
in Dining Room A of the Student
Union. They will be able to meet
with University administrators
and ask any questions concern-

APPLICATIONS

Applications are available at
the Student Union Desk for
Freshman Orientation chair-
man and- host. Also applica-
tions are still available for
Freshman Camp. Positions open
are chairman, head counselor,
and coordinator of activities.

Applications can be gotten at
the SU Desk and must be re-
turned to Miss Gasparovic in.
-D-_m..' next Wednes-

 
  

  
  

Wednesday was cancelled until’

its regular meeting next week.
The meeting had been called,
according to Manning,’ because of

the possibility of SDS being sub- Q:

versive, the unstated rule against
the distribution of literature at
Pitt Preview and the possibility
of violation of a social event.

“The purpose of Pitt Preview is '

to present an" external view to
guests and not an internal view
of any one organization,” Man-

ning said. “If the over 100 rec- f.

ognized student organizations

passed literature out there would 
be chaos. If one freshman were ‘’

lost, it would defeat the purpose a

of Pitt Preview.”
Weber said that Students for

Peace “have a right to distribute-
literature in a public area.” He-

believes that the petition “for an
urgent meeting of the Recogni-
tion Committee was founded on
incomplete information about
Students» for Peace and related’

V organizations.”

By NANCY FUCHS
Dr. Robert L. Gale, professor

of English, is a prolific writer

specializing in 19th century Amer-
ican literature. His ﬁfth book,
one of the Barron’s Simpliﬁed Ap-
proach to Literature series, will
be coming out soon.

Titled Emerson and Transcen-
dentalism, the book is described

A as “the heady essence of Emer-

son’s philosophy explained
through a study of his life and
letters, sermons, lectures,
journals, essays, and poetry.”

Dr. Gale wrote an earlier book
in the series on Walden by Henry
Thoreau’. His other three books
include a library reference, crit-
ical study, and biography. The
first is Plots and Characters in
the Fiction of Henry James, writ-
ten in 1965.

The second, The Caught Image,
wnitten in 1964, is the critical
study of symbols and metaphors
in all of the novels and short
stories of James. In 1964, he also

_ wrote a biography of the first
‘ American sculptor, entitled Thom-

as Crawford, American Sculptor.

Dr. Gale’s book on Crawford,
published by the. University of
Pittsburgh Press, was the first
biography of the sculptor to be
written. He became interested in
the subject when Crawford’s

granddaughter, an Italian coun-
Mtess, approached him with her

grandfather’s letters and person-
al papers on his trip to Naples
in 1958.

Dr. Gale came to the Universi-
ty in 1959 after teaching at Col-
umbia University, the Universi-
ty of Mississippi, and the Univer-

‘sity of, Delaware. He went to

Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship
and taught American literature
in Naples from 1956-58. Before
taking a six month sabbatical
last year, he had taught 16 tri-
mesters in a row, which he‘des-
cribes as “a killing pace.”
During his sabbatical he spent
a month in Rome. on a scholar-
ship from the Office of Cultural
and Educational Exchange and
spent the remaining time work-
ing on a biography of Richard

Henry Dama, author of Two

has so few alive women in his
works,” Dr. Gale explained.

In the first half of the spring
trimester, Dr. Gale is teaching a
new course called “The Roaring
Twenties.” “We’re going to cover
a year per night and discuss the
ﬁction, poetry, «and drama of such
writers as Fitzgerald, Stein, Wolf,
O’Neill, Cather, and Dryser.” We
will consider the themes of.re-
volt of youth, decay of morals

DR. ROBERT GALE
Publishes Fifth Book

Years Before the Mast. “So far
there has been no literary crit-
ical biography of Dama so this
book should be of some interest.
Dama was a wonderful guy. He
wrote one of the greatest travel
stories that has ever been writ-
ten,” Dr. Gale explained.

His biography of Dama as well
as a book on The. Grapes of Wrath
by John Steinbeck and The Red
Badge of Courage by Stephen
Crane will be coming out within
the year. I

Dr. Gale is also working on a
book on Francis Parkman and
hopes to edit an anthology of
Henry James’ short stories and
write a comprehensive summary
of Mark Twain’s work as he did
for James. He is especially inter-
ested in studying Twain’s female
characters. “It is curious that he

The Pitt News has invited me
to write a guest column and I
welcome the opportunity for this
added means of communication
with the student community. The
column will not appear on any
regularly scheduled basis. Rather,
as time and space permit, and as
issues arise, I hope to use this
generously accorded medium as a
place to discuss plans, problems
and prospects with you. I wish to
express my appreciation to The
Pitt News for extending this in-

I vitation.

The $64 question on cam-
jg. pus today is not really a $64
’ question but a $450 <1_11_eS-
" tion. It is: Will the tuition
reduction, presumably to_the
low ﬁgure of $450 bring
_ about a reduction in admis-
-- - sion stan-
dards?
Y o u s t u-
dents have
asked me the
question time
a n d a g a i n
whenever the
s u b j e c t of
state ‘- related-
- I / ness nas come
up. In a way, I'm happy that
this question is ‘‘bugging’’
you. It shows that you are
, of one mind with the ad-
niinistration in valuing the
academic standards we have
achieved.

BUT THE ANSWER to
T the question is “no.-” In fact,
the answer is more than
“no.” Low standards do not
go hand-in-hand with low
tuition; rather, the reverse
is closer to the truth. Our
. standards have an excellent
}- chance of improving as a re-
sult of lowered tuition.
This is not just an idle
hope. It is based on hard
facts concerning the kinds of
students who have not pre-
viously enrolled at the Uni-
versity and who are now
likely to enroll here. _
_. V First are the state stu-
0‘ * dents. At the present time
and in the years just past,
«we estimate that between
‘300 and 400 well qualiﬁed
' students in the immediate
lPittsburgh area —- within
‘commuting distance of the
'University—have not enroll-
ed here because they could
not afford our costs. These
are not the outstanding
scholars; if they had been
.~ they would have qualiﬁed for
top scholarships; but they
are above average students.

At all other times, students cannot personally distribute literature
or solicit or sell above the lobby ﬂoors. Opponents of direct room distri-
bution argue that such actions invade the privacy of the person occu-

, Some claim that the majority of dorm residents don’t want direct
distribution to rooms. They probably would accept such distribution if
they were sure that it would be handled in an orderly, manner. The re-

ture, if instituted, would keep this type of distribution within safe limits.

The Tower-Quadrangle Student Committee’s new policy for dis-
_ ‘semination of literature in the Towers is an admirable step forward in
g the ‘development of freedom of expression on campus. While it is a step
forward, it does not go far enough.

If student leaders wish to have a vibrant, questioning student body
they cannot deny students the prized man-to-man contact permitted by
distribution of literature directly to dormitory rooms. Under the new
rules one week before Student Government elections, distribution policies
will be suspended for campus political parties and candidates. Other ex-
ceptions, subject to the approval of the Towers Policy Committee, may

, Under the PPP suggestions, anyone passing out literature directly
to the rooms would have to register with the Men’s Housing Office. The
only method of distribution permitted would be under the door, and no

knocking on doors or congregating in the halls would be allowed. The floor

counselors would also be_ forewarned.
Such a process would prevent any gross invasions of the privacy
of dorm occupants. More important, it would open effective channels of
communications between students. Such new freedom might serve as a
stimulus to increased communication of this sort.

bility of Men’s Dorm Council to change rules affecting the dormitory

been going to any college, or
they have been going to col-
leges where the resident cost
is comparable to the Univer-
sity’s commuting cost. In
the 14 state colleges and in
a fair number of church re-
lated liberal arts colleges in
Eastern Ohio and Western
Pennsylvania, the total cost
for tuition, books, room and
board are equal or only
silghtly above the Universi-
ty’s basic tuition costs.
Some students in this cat-
egory need total assistance’;
others need $1,000 or more;
still others, through paren-
tal sacriﬁce, can afford be-
tween $1,500 to $1,800 a year
for education. Let’s say the
parents do make a sacriﬁce.
Still, that kind of money
won’t pay both tuition at the
University and the cost of
living at home. In such cases,
it has been cheaper to send
the student away to college
rather than to send him to
Pitt even as a commuter:

NOW, ASSUMING our es-
timates of the number of
these students is correct —
and we believe our estimates
are actually modest — the
University stands to attract
between 300 and 400 .stu-
dents as good as and consi-
derably better than the bot-
tom 300 entering freshmen.

If we replace the bottom
300 freshmen with better
students or if we add these
students, it stands to reason
that our student body cer-
tainly will remain as good as
it is, and that most prob-
ably it will become consider-
ably better.

But this is only one-half
of the picture. Next comes
the bright, but modest ﬁ-
nanced out-of-state student.

BY REDUCING the cost
to Pennsylvania students, the
University will be able to di-
rect a bit more of the avail-
able student aid to out-of-
state students who previous-
ly could not afford the Uni-
versity. Proportionately more

 

either have not '

scholarship dollars for these
students will place the Uni-
versity in a competitive posi-
tion with many other out-
standing nationals institu-
tions who up to now have
been able to offer more al-
luring student aid than we
have been able to offer. Many
schools in the University’s
academic class have been
able to give promising ‘stu-
dents from $1,500 to $2,000
in scholarships whereas the
best offer they might have
received from the Universi-
ty would be a scholarship of

an $800 loan, and a job which

would pay $400.

That briefly, is the answer
to the $450 question.

The Towers’ Lobby Committee must be praised for changing the po-
licy of dissemination of literature in the Towers Lobby. Now students
may personally pass out literature in the lobby at any time. But others
must apply the principles embodied in’ these changes to dormitory rooms
as well. Only then will we have true freedom of expression within the

Project Teach Could
Prove Beneficial

V Editor, The Pitt News:

Project Teach, whose teacher-
evaluation results have recently

been disseminated, seem to me

to have taken the first step in a
program that could prove very
beneﬁcial to the students of the
University. No one has a better
right than students to make eval-
uations of their professors, and
the faculty has an obligation to
seriously consider such com-
ments. _

At present there is almost no

pressure on the faculty to pro-’

duce so far as the quality of un-
dergraduate teaching is concern-
ed. I am afraid that both faculty
and administration sorely need
the judgment of a third party on
this score,’ and there is no more
logical candidate than those who
suffer most from the inability of
the faculty to discipline them-
selves in the area of undergrad-

_uate teaching. Not that most pro-

fessors do not make a very seri-
ous effort to provide the best
courses they can, but there are
always a few who find under-
graduates a waste of time ‘and
need to be prodded into a more
responsible attitude.

so that its ﬁndings can be as ac-

In this way students can become
a very constructive force in uni-

Open Honors
Program To All

Editor, The Pitt News:

Dr. Morris Berkowitz’ speech
at the Phi Eta Sigma Smoker
(Pitt News, March 16) is obvi-
ously justiﬁed by the fact that

the University does over recog-

nize the omnipotent -“good” QPA.

What I ﬁnd amusing, however,
is not the article on Dr. Berko-
witz’ speech, but The Pitt News
editorial entitled “Combating An-
ti-Intellectualism.” The Pitt News,
it seems, advocates’ a program
whereby intellectuals can use
their_potentia1. Although I real-
ize that The Pitt News finds Dr.
Berkowitz’ views “overstated.” I
note with amusement that the
program advanced in the editori-
al is based on having a 3.25 QPA.
Coupled with the fact that Dr.
Berkowitz said, “Most intellec-
tuals get bad grades, “this leads
to rather an ambiguous situation_
to say the least.

If we are going to further
intellectualism at the University
(a rather unusual thought) why
must we look at QPA’s? How
much better it. would be to open
the honors“  rp‘gram' to any stu-

 

  
 
 

dent who ‘ so desires. It doesn't
have to be called an “honors"
program.

This all makes me wonder
whether in advocating a pre-
packaged program, The Pitt News
is being slightly anti-intellectual?

New Head Coach Stresses
Discipline, Agi1ity,Running

By GEORGE LIES
Discipline, agility, and running are three lessons head
football coach Dave Hart was belaboring with.his players
at Spring practice this week. Bit by bit, he gives it to them,
using a detailed schedule which exploits every minute of

the daily two hour workouts.

Hart will be doing quite a bit
of laboring before spring prac-
tice ends; trying to rebuild a
much depleted Panther varsity.
Nine regulars return from last
year’s scarred contingent. Hart is
not sure these nine will start
next season, however. He holds
no exception.

Our depth chart is set up so
we have four teams for practice,”
Hart said. “The ﬁrst team in-
cludes seniors ‘and some regu-
lars; the second, juniors, and so
on.” ’

Returning regulars are split ends

Television is missing out. For years now that demon of
mass communication has been featuring a show called “Bo-
nanza.” I hate to hurt Ben Cartwright’s feeling, but his

~. Ponderosa doesn't compare with the empire that Dave Hart

has been carving out of the Western Pennsylvania-Eastern

 Ohio area.

 _ ‘In three short months, the youthful hope of Pitt foot-

ball has been tapping heavily the talent of the local coal

mining towns. He and his staff have gone about their ﬁrst

““‘“'big task with such vengeance, the keg is almost dry. By the
end of this weekend the number of recruits signed is ex-
pected to reach 30. '

When the number hits 32, Hart will have doubled.the

. number of freshman stars brought in last year by the since
departed staff of John Michelosen. The others schools—Penn
State, Syracuse, Ohio Sta.te—that also use this area for their
hunting grounds must be feeling the pressure of Harts
-campaign.
A M Hart has a vision. When the subject of recruiting comes
“up, he’ll raise his ﬁnger and draw an imaginary line in air.
At one end is Cleveland. At the other is University Park. In
between Hart has been planting his brand: PITT TERRI-
vTORY—NO TRESPASSING. -

Thumbing through the names of Hart’_s future Panthers
provides a fairly good insight into the philosophy that.Wlll
characterize Pitt football in the future. With few exceptions,

V -most of the recruits are tall, lean and strong. /
Hart knows a good thing when heysees it. For a long
time Birmingham, Alabama, has been known as the Pitts-

.ball, but its products are also known to be big and slow._It
adds up to another case of the immovable object vs. the ir-
prestible force—Hart’s goal.

What’s the reason for the difference in speed between
Northern and Southern football? “It’s the weather. Down
. South the athlete can stay outdoors all year around. Mov-
ing around in the fresh air keeps the muscles in tone. Up
North everybody has to shift indoors as soon as Winter hits.
Practicing inside slows a kid up and makes him lazy,” said
Hart.

The.attack on_ weather is on. Practically every drill the

football players were put through in the Winter physical
ﬁtness program was designed to develop speed. _

Mononucleosis Won’t Keep

According to ' the rumor
circulating around campus,
junior fullback Mike Rakle-
wicz won’t be playing foot-

ball for the Panthers next

fall. A medical report has
revealed mononucleosis, severe
enough to sideline him for the
upcoming season..

All this is news to Raklewicz.
“I don't know where anybody
got that idea,” he said. “I had a
slight case of mononucleosis, but
it wasn’t anything serious.

“The doctor told me a few
days ago that I should rest this

week. He's given me the okay for"

Monday, which means that I’ll
be joining practice then. And
I’m ready to go all out,” Rakle-
wicz added.

The bond fullback impressed
many last year as a sophomore.
especially in the Miami win,
when he ripped on considerable
yardage as Barry McKnight’s
substitute.

Raklewicz, however, can’t claim
to be McKnight’s permanent re-

namely Jim Flanigan, Joe Jones
and a few others.

-“I can either play there or at

' defensive halfback,” he continued.

“It’s up to the coaches to decide
what they want me to do.”
Head coach Dave Hart has in-
dicated that Raklewicz ﬁts some-
where in his plans for next fall.
“He's a real goodvkid,” Hart said.

All that Raklewicz will have
missed because of illness is four
days of spring practice. Other.
than those four missed days, he
won’t be at any disadvantage,
physical or otherwise, in his try
for a starting spot in the Pan-
ther lineup. next season.

Miale, and left halfback Bob Dy-
er from the offensive team. On
defense, middle guard Dave
Drake, linebackers Jim Flanigan
and Tom Mitrakos, and safety
Tippy Pohl return.

Since the ﬁrst day of drills,
Tuesday, returning players have
noted a few new changes in the
daily program. The ﬁrst ten min-
utes of practice are devoted to
form running for everyone and
then coach Billy Lewis puts the-
defensive backs through its bin-
go ‘drills. This occurs at the same
time the offense moves, through
its agility assignments.

“In these practices, we are
teaching ' them “discipline,” Hart
said. “We want, to get them used.
to a certain pace. With the new
drills, we want to develop quick-
ness in the players.”

Before the players even reach
the stadium grass, they are put
to work. They must cross line-
backer coach Dick Bestwick’s
bridge, a set of parallel bars.
“The boys aren’t used to this yet
but it develops the shoulder mus-

_,eles, preventing many injuries

during the season,” Hart said.

Going into the Spring session,
Hart was .looking for the solu-
tions to a couple of problems,
ﬁnding a quarterback and an of-
fensive line. '

“There is no question, we have
a weak line and we have to come
up with a couple of good play-
ers,” Hart said. “As for the quar-
terback position, there is not one
veteran for the spot and to de-
velop one requires a lot ofwork.”
Hart looks to one of three for
his signal caller, Pohl, Ed James,
or Bob Bazylak.

Next Fall Hart’s teams may do
more passing since he is sticking
strictlyto the “I” formation. “A
team can do more things from
the “I” but we’ll be running a
lot too,” Hart said.

He demonstrates this with use

Hayden the team captain and a
top point getter for three years,
was virtually useless in the in-

We developed Plcturephone*

service so you can see as well as talk
when you call. And be seen, too.-

We introduced Tele-Lecture service
(two~wa-y amplified phone calls)

to let you hear lecturers

in distant locations. And so you -
could ask them questions

no matter how far away they were.

Some of these services
are available now.

_ Others are being tested.
Right now, many students can dial

will be able to dial into a

to get information for his courses.

better get a move on.
