Future Affairs

The University of Pittsburgh Base
Hospital «unit, known in France and
in armycircles as Base Hospital‘ 27,
is iplanning a' monster banquet. and
reunion for Friday evening, December
19th. . _ . —

The unit, organized at Pitt in the
spring of 1917 largely from the Uni-
versity medical and undergraduate
schools and with nurses .recruited
from Pittsburgh hospitals, was called
into active service in the. early fall
of 1917, left for France in September.
of the same year and in the subse-
quent year and a half made a record
for efficiency equalled by few ‘and
surpassed by-no other organization of
like character in the A. E. F., accord-

ing to several, officers of high rank.
some very prominent Pitt undergrad-

“Jim” Morrow of the football squad,
were with the corps during its period
of service. .' ' ’ i 1

out, a permanent ‘organiza.tion,. born
of close associations in thearmy, was
formed. : ' -

Two previous banquets have -been
held which many of the men, despite
numerous other activities, attend-ed.
At the last banquet a regular busi-
ness organization was, formed and the
following men elected to act as oili-
cers for a. year: W. ‘P. Walker, presi-
dent; Paul O. Burggraf, secretary, and
Max E. Hannum, treasurer._ L These
men, acting as a committee, are
pushing the plans for the December"
19 reunion. .

No pains are -being‘ spared to as-
sure the success of the affair and a
large attendance atit. News letters,
recalling some of the humorous inci-
dents of past army service, and urg-
ing the men to “get together” for the

purpose of talking over old times,

have been sent to every member of the
organization. Accommodations have
been secured at _the Fort Pitt hotel
and special entertainment has been
arranged for the evening.

Former oiﬁcers as well as the en-‘
listed men of the outﬁt have been in-
vited to attend and as large turnout
of them is expected. At the meet-
ing, plans for welding a closer and
more permanent organization will be
discussed, ‘but the greater part of
-the evening will be given; over to
“just a. good time.” ‘

A “banquet? was held last Monday

for the benefit of the faithful few.
Elizabeth'Matt.h.ews and Dora Breskin
served, while'Brothers Lytle, Hannum
and Williams ate,

A struggling vote was taken as to
who should get the extra piece of pie.
The vote was taken when Lytle had
his mouth full—~h.-e’ could not answer
-—-therefore “Max” got -the pie. ‘

blared forth with muchmellow music“
that was sweet to listen to. That
Band. is something to be proud of. And
Benny’s and Jerry's orchestra sent
sweet refrains across the hall that set
us all to humming and shuffling. Jim-
mie Muir was on the program, too, and
his “Lauder” stuﬂ? got across in great
style. Jimmie’ is a real,Scot. , The
Glee Club Quartet, the Old Guard and
the Magician of Jazz got big hands
from the crowd which took particular
pleasure in razzing Mr. Magician.
“Get That Ball, Pitt,” was the 017
that greeted his hidden ‘ball trick.

Next, Captain-elect Herb Stein was
introduced while a crowd off in one
corner sang “There’s a Stein on the
Table.” And then Herb spoke--or
tried to. But the crowd was so en-
thusiastic in the ‘greeting extended to
him that he had. little opportunity to
show his oratorical powers. v

men willinvite thegco-eds as usual.
no customary rules in holding leap

Leap. Year dance, according to the
committee: will be of an entirely new‘
nature. Leap Yearvnove.1_ties' will be
introduced ‘during ‘the -course of the”

  In RALLY AT:
   rm

Smoker Willbe Held on Dec.
18 ‘at Y. C. A. "Hut ’

The lid is to be removed from the
pepper box! Things are about -to hap-
pen. The School of Economics. is
about to break out into ' festivity and
reassert its proud boast that it is the
original domicile of pep, jazz and
spirit. It won't _be a banquet, it won’t
be a. smoker, it won’t be an entertain-
ment. The “gang” is going to get to-
gether and have a. “time.” S “It" is go-
ing to happen on the evening of De-
cember 18 in the Y. M. C. A. building.
No. it won’t' be a banquet, but there
will be eats. It won’t be a smoker,
but there will be smokes. It won’t be
an entertainment, but most of . the
School of Economics will be there.
The Dean is back of the party, and so
are the others of the faculty. They
have not only put their “O. K.” on the
plans, but have added a. “Let’s go” as
well, .

‘A committee is at work on the ar-
rangements and already has the plans
for the affair almost completed. The
committee follows: Harry Gow, Dick
Love, Tom Thornton, Max Hannum,
Cedric B-raun, Frank Maxﬁeld -and Bill
Potter.‘ . A  e ‘ ‘
The committee” announces that a

inimitable pair, Liggett and Wain-
wright, will be seen in action. A jazz
orchestra will be assembled, composed
entirely of ‘School of Economics tal-
ent. The football quartet will be there.
Jack Thompson ,will probably be on
hand. This much the committee is
willing to reveal concerning its plans,
but it is holding ‘something back. The
committee promises a. ysurpri-se or two.
There is going to be a Christmas
tree. On this Christmas tree are go-
mg to be ‘hung presents for the dif-
ferent members of the faculty. There
will be no attempt to engender’ hard
feelings or settle’ old grudges‘ when
these presents are given out, but sev-
eral good’ laughs are expected when
the Santa Claus act is sprung,

There will be fun, music, eats’,
smokes and pe-p——a.1l for the sum of
$1. The past reputation of the School
of Economics assures the committee
that the affair will be nothing but suc-
cessful. . .

Those who, visit the Campus next
year, and in succeeding years, will
ﬁnd the alumni hall one of the best
planned‘-’ and most eﬂicient of Univer-

And only those whoare in touch. with
Mr. Woolridge’s eﬁorts, as a member
of the building committee, realize to

what a degree he will be responsible -

for the success which seems so cer-

Mr. Wbolridge spent’ two years. at

the ‘Banjo Club and as a member of

Because of the after effects of the
Thanksgiving recess and the conse-
quent lack of preparation, the‘ “Get
Acquainted” party which the Fresh-
man girls had planned to give in the
Heinz House last Wednesday, was
postponed. V

The contemplated party, however,
has not been indeﬁnitely’ postponed,
for it is rumored that the aifair may
take place in -the near future, and it
has even been hinted that the Fresh-

John Allin McEwen, M. E. '94-." V V
Few f “deed are the graduates of
any institution who can boast,‘-such
a record as that of the McEWens, of
Pitt--a son graduating exactly 25
years after his father in the same
school, same department and.-with‘ the
corresponding‘ degree. John .  Mc-
Ewen enjoyed last June this unusual
distinction, the 25th reunionof his
class~——'that of 1894——occurring during
the -Commencement Week when his
eldest son received his degree. And
both father and son graduated lume-

chanical engineering! ' P
,McEwen.“¥'Senior- is among V Pitt’s
most loyal’ alumni. Perhaps it’s be-
cause few students here or elsewhere
have had to make so sterna ﬁght to
gain university ‘training. He” “began
by gaining admission, by examination,
to the Sophomore class, after securing
his preparatory ‘training’ by availing
himself of -every opportunity while
working on his fVather"s farm.»°' always
under ‘severe’-ﬁnancial pressure,‘ He-
made good in his classes at “Wu-p”
despite the demands .. of self-s1‘1pport-
ing work which took much of his

time; he -had toVdropV..out of school.
f onca-ii-becau_se of af; serious illness and V

again because his funds gave out, but
his determination never wavered, he
made up his work as few would have
been ablevto do it, and graduated with
his V.class'., 0‘ g »  i ,
