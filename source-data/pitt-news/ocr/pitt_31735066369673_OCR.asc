The Student Government Board
Friday unanimously endorsed a
resolution calling forrthe Board of
Trustees to hold an advertised
public meeting “open to all Pitt
students” to discuss the need and
implications of the pending tuition
hike. ,

Copies of the resolution were
mailed to Chancellor Posvar and
his six vice-chancellors. as the
resolution was introduced at the
SGB meeting.

Undergraduate students face
$130 to $170 tuition increase next
fall, depending upon whether the
university receives a 5 percent or a
7 percent appropriations increase.
The trustees have raised tuition
ﬁve times since 1976.

Before introducing the
resolution, SGB president Stan
Galanski questioned whether the
Pitt. students could continue
absorbing large tuition increases,
year after year. .

“Who gets hurt? The student
who pays for their own tuition and
the student from the low, income
family,” Galanski said.

Dr. Ed Bozik, assistant Chan-
cellor, when contacted late

yesterday afternoon, was surprised
to here about the resolution.

“It’s the ﬁrst‘ time I’ve heard
about it,” he said. “It seems a
rather strange way to request a
meeting with’ the Board of
Trustees, by way of the media.”

SGB member Cindy DeMatteo
said in next year’s proposed budget
student services are receiving
smaller increases than “research,
operating and maintenance and
public service”.

‘‘It kind of makes you wonder
what the university’s priorities are;
it certainly isn’t the students,
obviously,” she said. '

DeMatteo told the board she
received little advance notice of the
trustees meeting, which she
attended.

“I was simply there for show,”
she said. “I was not to open my
mouth in any way shape or form,
nod my head or anything-just be
there so they can say the student
body was aware because one of the
student Government Board
members was there.”

Bozik told the Pitt News students

have‘ a voice in budgetary and
tuition matters through various
.committees and boards.

Most students are home lorthe summer, making it easy for those that
remain to find a peaceful spot in the sun.

Court Ruling on Hand

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

A U.S. Supreme Court decision
last week that some called a defeat
for the nation’s handicapped
people may not be as bad as it
seems, according to Alden Bowen,
director’ of Special Student
Services.

A ,,r The Court ruled Monday that a

1973 law, designed to_ end bias
against the handicapped, does not
require institutions ‘of» higher

’ learning to offer. “affirmative

« relief’ ’ "for" these persons.

‘A section ‘of that,ﬂ_law, the
Rehabilitation  of 1973- prohi-, .

bits programs receiving federal
funds from discriminating against
any “otherwise qualified
handicapped individual.”

Bowen, who coincidentally wit-
nessed that ruling, said students
presently attending Pitt probably
will not be affected by the decision.

“I don’t think its going to have
any serous impact on students
presently attending who are
handicapped,” Bowen said.

I Institutions still cannot dis-
criminate against handicapped
students, Bowensaid. However, a
university can determin if a

SGB Questions Legitimacy ofTuition Increase

unanimously passed a resolution requesting Pitt’s Board of Trustees to hold a public meeting to discuss tuition in-

creases with students.

“As far as I know, none of these
(groups) had been acted upon
(before passing the resolution),
Bozik said.

The SGB members are con-_

cerned about how students will pay
for the tuition increase.

“Every year it (tuition) gets
higher and higher and higher;
it’s never ending; there’s no

ceiling to it,” said SGB member
Rita Cordisco. , _
“Pitt_’s going to be out of the
question‘now,”— added SGB mem-
ber Kim Watterson. “We’re going
to be like an Ivy league school.”

Orientation Set for Weekend;

Freshmen Check-in Saturday

By JIM CONNELLY

Pitt will take on the illusion of a
bustling Fall term when 2,000 new
faces get their first look at college
life during orientation, which
begins Saturday morining.

Resident Assistants will be

joined by 124 mentors to lead the

prgspective freshmen through
academic and social activities

through next Tuesday.

In addition to the traditional
workshops and discussion sessions,
this year’s orientation .program will
also feature performances of “The
Fantastiks” at Stephen Foster
Memorial and the Studio Theatre’s
“The Prophecy” Sunday night.

One change in this year’s
program, according to Dawn

seriously hampers the student’s
participation in a program or
his/her performance on the job, he
added.

The latter situation is what
happened to Frances Davis, one of
the participants in the Supreme
Court reversal of a lower court’s

decision.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals had ruled that

Southeastern Community College
in North’ Carolina had violated the

law when it did not allow Qavis to , .
participate in its nursing program. —

 The Supreme Courtruling found

that Davis was not qualiﬁed for the

Gideon, Orientation Chairperson,
involves the mentor program.

Unlike past years, when fresh-
men were randomly assigned to
their mentors, this year’s selection
will be based on fall housing
assignments. Each mentor group
will be comprised of commuters.
and students who will be assigned
to the same floor this ‘fall.

Gideon believes _this will result in
greater
mentors and R.A.’s.

“They (mentors and R.A.’s) are
going to be working a lot closerithis
year,” Gideon said.

In the past, mentor programs
have’ been well received by the
freshmen, Gideon added.

“We usually get really good
feedback about the mentors,” she

nursing program because of her
severe hearing disability.

Davis, a licensed practical nurse
for twelve years, tried to enroll in
Southeastern’s associate nursing
program which leads to licensing as
a registered nurse.

Because registered nurses per-
form certain sophisticated medical
tasks, the school was told‘ by an
audiologist that her hearing im-
pairment would hamper her on the
job. I I _

pretation of the ruling is main-

said. “The mentors get psyched up

and feel closer to the freshmen as a ‘

result”.

In the past, many freshmen have
congregated in the Quad during
orientation, and once again,
WPGI-I radio will be broadcasting
in this area. This year, however,‘
broadcast hours will be cut‘,fr,om 31
to 20 hours. The reduction,
initiated by Bob Firth, director of
new student programs, was
introduced because department
administrators claimed WPGH’s
late hours in past years adversely

affected student performances on

placement exams.

Gideon said students will be
encouraged to visit Pitt’s athletic
facilities, where various activities
have been scheduled,

icapped: How Much Damage?

“If the court is to determine
future case so that schools could
exercise more discretion in ad-
missions practices, then I think it
will be have a detrimental effect on
the rights of the handicapped,”
Bowen said.

“If this (Mondays ruling) is as
far as it goes, I don’t see it as a
blow to handicapped students,”
he added.

Opinion

Ready For
Teddy?

Move over, Muhammed Ali, those claims of the
fight of the century are misplaced—the fight is going
on right now and it’s in the Democratic party, and
the opponents are none other than Senator Edward
Kennedy and President Jimmy Carter.

The topic is the issue of health care, but written
between the laws of the bill that is constantly being
tossed and revised between Congress and the White
House, is the question of whether Carter again will
be his party's candidate.

Carter and Kennedy have continuously locked
horns over various issues in this pre-primary year,
and the senator has come off from these confron-
tations with a form and grace rare among politicians,
and almost jolting in the suprising fact that it is Ken-
nedy who has emerged as the leader of the party.
After all, it was not so long ago that the then playboy
senator was wet behind the ears from Chappaquid-
dick, he whom writer Gore Vidal once quipped
“wanted a seat in -the senate like most young men
want a sports car.” But emerged full blown, Ken‘-
nedy has, and he is doing an upstanding job-both in

On top of the fracas lies Kennedy's statement that?
he will not seek the office, though his actions do little;
to disclaim this popular assumption. 

The simple fact is Kennedy is leading Carter in the
polls and Carter is running scared. But it is not an at-1
tractive or appealing image-—a scared president-and-f
surely Carter realizes that his eruptions make "hm;
only seem ludicrous. ’ '

And the ﬁghts are obscuring the real issue-—the
Health Care bill. Carter's belligerence and goal to?-
top Kennedy are, we feel, obscuring his genuine in-
terest in the importance of the health bill. '

When the attacks merely backlash, it was childish;
but understandable. Now, they are getting in the way
of Carter doing his job. And there is no excuse.

If Carter persists with these tactics, he will be
shoveling dirt over the coffin of his political career.
And the public may send some flowers but there will
be little sincere grief.

the senate and in responding with dignity to the

Every Summer Pitt’s Board of
Trustees passes a tuition increase
and every year the Student
Government Board questions the
need for such action.

Friday it was SGB President Stan
Galanski’s turn.

Galanski seemed anxious to get
the SGB Board meeting started. He
was running around the SGB
offices gathering notes and hustl-
ing board members into the

’ meeting room . He wore a sharp

whit suite and a smile to match.

The SGB’s “question” this year
was to come in the form of a
137-word resolution calling for an
advertised public meeting of the
Board of Trustees to “explain the
need for a tuition hike and discuss
the implications of the increase.”

Galanski, in drafting the resolu-
tion, went another step further. He
informed city-wide newspapers,
radio and television stations about
the impending action.

  

president.

Carter, on the other hand, comes off the buffoon.
His childish attacks, born out of fear of surging sup-
port for Kennedy, make even Jerry Ford’s infamous
pratfalls not so ludicrous and lacking in-dignity for a

president by comparison.

Last week, Carter responded tersely and succinctly
to allegations that Kennedy will run for the presiden-
cy in 1980.

“l’ll whip his ass,” said Carter, the pious Baptist

Sunday school teacher.

“The Student Government
Board, as the elected representa-
tives of the full-time undergraduate
students at the University of
Pittsburgh, deplores the tuition
increase and questions both its
legitimacy and necessity,” Galan-
sky told a reporter from a city radio
station.

’ Has a copy of the resolution been
sent to Dr. Posvar?” the reporter
asked.

Galanski chuckled.

“No comment,” he said.

“Will a copy of the resolution be
sent to the chancellors ofﬁce?”

“No comment,’{ Galanski said,
again laughing.

Galanski was laughing because,
if his timing was _right, Chancellor
Posvar would recieve the resolution
approximately the same time the
news would be blared throughout
the city via radio. ’

According to one top Pitt
adminstrator, however, no such

$228.7 million two-fold “contin-
gency budget.” This special
budget was passed in light of the
budget debate in Harrisburgh,
which have yet to be resolved.
Pitt’s first budget takes into
account a ﬁve percent increase in
state appropriations (Gov. Richard
Thornburgh’s plan) and the second
is based on a seven percent
increase (the house plan). Either
way, Pitt students face the prospect
of paying more next year. Students
will pay $65 more per term it the

House plan passes and $85 more if '
. Thornburgh’s budget wins out. i

“The meeting was a farce, ’ ’ SGB
member Cindy DeMatteo said of
last Tuesday’s Trustees meeting.
DeMatteo said she was contacted

one hour before the meeting was to .

take place. ,

“Just be there. That's all they
said.” DeMatteo added. “It’s
fairly obvious that the members of
the Board of Trustees are not
students and they haven't talked to

out of touch with what's going on.”

While Friday's SGB meeting
was convened to present the
resolution, it turned into a
discussion involving many areas of
student services at the university.
Board members, as well as other
students questioned a variety of
areas ranging from Student Union
Renovations to the Student Health
Service. It was as if students were
attempting to recreate the famous

Karen Metzinger, Advt. Repreresentitive

scene from the movie “Network.”
“We’re mad as hell and...”
“How-can the Chancellor talk
about a budget crunch when they
take trustees to 2P56 for meet-
ings?” one student asked. ZPS6 is a
plush, very modern’ meeting room
in the Forbes Complex that is used
about as often as the Trustees

. meet.

“It kind of makes you wonder
what the University’s priorities are-
it certainly isn’t the students,”
DeMatteo said.

It will be interestimg to see what
course of actiongthe SGB now turns
to. Will it be content as past boards
have been, to leave its condem-
nation of the tuition increase on
paper alone? 

“Passing a resolution has to
have a subsequent followup.”

Galanski-said. “You have to keep ,_

on plugging. This is at least a start
to make the Board of Trustees
realize that students are having
trouble making it.” ‘

“It’s only going to work if there
is a followup,” added board
member Kim Watterson.

_ The Pitt adminstration will most
likely respopnd to the SGB’s
resolution with a memo stating
“We sympathize with the student
body but...” or it may not respond
at all. In either case the football will
be thrown right back into the SGB’s

lap. Whether the SGB runs-
forward, backward or fumbles is up

to Galanski.
