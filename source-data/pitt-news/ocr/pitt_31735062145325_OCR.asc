Nationality Room
Committees Meet

In Memorial Hall  

Chancellor’s Reception Replaces
Annual Dinner For Room
Heads; 600 Attend

 

Approximately 600 people attended
the reception for the seventeen com-
mittees for the nationality rooms in
the Cathedral, given by Dr. John G.
Bowman, chancellor of the University,
in the banquet room of Memorial hall
at 8:30 o'clock last night. The re-
ception, replacing Dr. Bowman's an-
nual dinner for the ofﬁcers of the
committees, was a much larger gather-
ing of workers for the nationality
rooms, and friends of the committee
members as well as the committee
ofﬁcers and official members were re-
ceivcd.

In his address on the campaign
plans to ﬁnish the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, Dr. Bowman told the committees
that the Cathedral fund drive would
offer the committees the opportunity
to avail themselves of. the enthusiasm
and incentive of the general campaign
towards the interests of the nation-
ality rooms speciﬁcally,

Among the distinctive features of
the evening was the announcement
of a pledge of $10,000 for the Scottish
room from anonymous friends in Pitts-
burgh. The cash sum of $572.40 was
also presented to Dr. Bowman by
several of the committees at the re-
ception. Of this amount the Italian
\V'omen’s league presented the $222.40
proceeds from the Nativity tableaux
staged last December, a check for $50
was the gift of the Hungarian Univer-
sity Students’ club of Pittsburgh for
the Hungarian room. The committee
for the Lithuania room gave $100 and
the committee for the Czecho-Slovak
room, $200, thus completing the cash
donations. In addition, the commit-
tee for the Scottish room contributed
their signed deed of gift. The other
committees will offer their presenta-
tions and pledges in the near future.
The various committees and several
of the guests spoke from the floor
in discussion of the campaign.

Thirty students of the University
acted as ushers and hostesses during
the evening, and military aides from
the ROTC checked wraps on the
first ﬂoor of the hall; M,usical num-
bers on the program were rendered
by the Men’s Glee club of the Uni-
versity, and a trio from the Univer-
sity orchestra.

The chairmen of the Italian, Jugo-
slav, Polish and Czecho-Slovak wo-
men's leagues served refreshments.

at the individual houses.

Prominent members of the faculty
and administration and noted Pitts-
burgli ministers numbering 21 com-
prise the speakers for the forums. The
placing of speakers at the various
houses was determined by the inter-
est those houses indicated in certain
topics.

The series will close on Monday,
March 26, when the fourth set of
forums will be conducted.

At Monday night’s meetings, four
men, Rev. R. O. Eisele, at the Pi
Kappa Alpha house, Dean N. R. H.
Moor at the Phi Gamma Delta house,
Rabbi Jerome Rosenbloom at the
Sigma Mu house, a.nd Dr. Schuyler
Garth, at the Sigma Chi house, dis-
cussed the question, “If Religion con-
tributes as much to life as is cla.imed
for it, why is it not more ‘popular’?"
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison at the Phi
Delta Theta house, Mr. Robert D.
Ayars at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house, and Dr. M. C. Elmer at the
Theta Chi house, spoke on, “How shall
we choose our life companion and pre-
pare for a. successful marriage?” Dr.
M. R. Gabbert. at the Delta Tau Delta
house and Dean E. A. Ilolbrook at the
Phi Epsilon Pi house discussed, “After
College-—-Vvliat?” Dr. John Ray
Ewers at the Kappa. Sigma house
spoke on, “What shall we do when
faith and reason clash?” Rev. C. Mar-
shall Muir at the Lambda Chi Alpha
house discussed, ""\Vhat contribution,
if any, does religion make to the de-
velopment of personality?" Dr. J. C.
Blakney at the Phi Kappa. house inter-
preted the question, “Vvhat contribu-
tion. if any, can religion make to the
solution of social and economic prob-
lems?” and Rev. Carl A. Voss at the

Pi Lambda Phi house discussed the,

vcays in which college strengthens or
weakens religious faith.

Volunteer Social Workers

7 “Seeing Things”Made 7
Newest Sport
In Exhibit

If you like to “see things,” with-
out getting any of the after-ef-
fects usually associated with pink
elephants and other moptical il-
lusions, you must visit the dis-
play arranged in Room 112, Thaw
hall, by Dr. E_ -Hutchisson and
Dr. V. Hickes, of the physics de-
partment. The exhibit consists
of two specially constructed cab-
inets in which certain laws of
physics are illustrated. However,
the display has been arranged
from a common interest view-
point also, and on each cabinet
are directions for operating the
machines along with an explana-
tion of each experiment.

By looking into a glass enclosed
opening you may see yourself ex-
actly as if you were looking at
yourself through some one else’s
eyes. This is made possible by
the arrangement of two mirrors
in such a way that they reﬂect
your image as seen by others.

Another exhibit shows the dif-
ference in sound waves. By snap-
ping on a switch, millions of elec-
trons are seen in the form of a
green ray, which is ﬂashed across
a small screen, A miniature micro-
phone below the screen is con-
nected to it and transforms any

 

sound into a movement of the
ray.

By looking directly into an
opening in the “Phantom Lamp”
cabinet you see what appears to
be an electric light bulb. If the
eyes are moved to the side this
image disappears.

To Name Leaders
For Fund Drive
Early Next Week

To Make Appeal For $1,650,000;
Outstanding Business Men
Will Lead Campaign

 

Plans for the immediate public ap-
peal for $4,650,000 to take advantage
of federal CWA funds and_ to complete
and make effective the 40-story Cathe-
dral are being completed and details
are expected to be released at an early
date.

Appointments of prominent Pitts-
burghers to assist in the coming ap-
peal is expected next week. The first
campaign for the Cathedral was gen-
eralled by Pittsburgh’s outstanding
business and industrial lead-ers, and
they are again expected to lend their
personal force to the present effort.

Plans for the completion of the Uni-
versity’s tall building call speciﬁcally
for ﬁnishing of the first 20 floors and
“rough ﬁnishing” of the upper 20,
which will not be needed for some
time to come. Through an appropria-
tion of $745,000 in CWA funds, recent-
;lv assured, the public subscription of
i$1,650,000 will enable the University
to use the building effectively without
longer delay.

At the present time the only ﬂoors
occupied are those from the sixth
through the thirteenth. Successive
halts in construction have delayed
much of the building’s effectiveness.
Although a large part of the student
body is using the building at some
time during each day, the overcrowded
condition of the small area in use has
made it imperative that the lower 20
floors be made available as quickly as
possible.

Student activities, such as the
Cwens and Druids, will sponsor tea
dances, the proﬁts of which will be
turned over to the Cathedral fund.
However, no fund drive will be made
among the student. organizations-or
the student body as a part of the cam-
paign. Students are asked to take
part as individuals in this drive as are
the alumni. _

Rooms on the fourteenth floor are
being plastered now and completion of
this work will mark the ﬁrst ﬁnished

"plans go through offices and class

on the thirteenth ﬂoor will
move to the finished fourteenth.

At Metals Group Dinner

The Scciety for Metals conducted its

Psychology Forum

A. Falk, noted criminologist, pre-
sented a study of the factors that
may cause prisoners to escape, at
the Monday meeting of the Psychology
forum, in Room 308, Alumni hall.

The report included information
from the ﬁles of the Rockview farm
‘lat Bellefonte and from direct con-
iversation with the prisoners who had
escaped and were captured. Mr. Falk
has taken the records of 247 prisoners
who have escaped over a period of
twelve years and has also examined
the records of 247 who stayed at
the farm and served their sentence,
comparing those who had escaped
with their “controls” in their re-
spective environmental backgrounds,
in psychological and psychiatric ﬁnd-
ings,’ and in criminal and institutional
data_ ,

A striking signiﬁcance was found
in the environmental background rec-
ords of those who had escaped and
their controls. “More escapes left
home,” Mr. Falk stated, “at the age

Hears A. Falk

Discuss Data On Prison Escapes-

 

of nineteen or under than did con-
trols, and there were fewer escapes
than controls who had never left home.

Although the psychological and
psychiatric ﬁndings did not prove sig-
niﬁcant, the criminal and institutional
data showed marked differences be-
tween escapes‘ and controls. “There
is a tendency,” Mr. Falk asserted,
“for the escape to be more or less
of a “lone wolf” both in the original
crime and in his escape
farm, as compared with the control.
This is contrary to a popular notion
that those who break from jail are
connected with gangs.

Another peculiarity which the rec-
ords 1'grese'nt-‘ed was the fact that
there were more escapes of prisoners
who had been sentenced for larceny
and -burglary than for homicide or
emotional crimes. “Also,” Mr. Falk
continued. There were more pro-
fessionals among the escapes, and
those who run away are more apt to
be more emotional or suggestive than
the controls.”

of assigning students to employment
under the CWA. '

Sound easy? Well, you-never really
tried it. The faculty members and
others who are axing for a student
worker, in nine c 4 es out of ten ask

Bad Mans Must Pay
For Cuss Words
In One Oﬂice

At least one University ofﬁce
staff has discovered a way to com-
mercialize the habit that some
people have of letting a “cuss”
word slip out now and then.

A snooping Pitt News reporter
nosed into a certain University
office yesterday and was offered
3 niece of candy by a member of
the ofﬁce staff. He was informed
that it was a product of the “cuss
box.”

After further investigation on
the subject he learned that every
time a. member of the staff ‘‘let
slip” one of the bad words he
was charged a penny, a nickel, a
dime or a dollar, depending upon

 

the prearranged value of the
word. These small collections
were placed in the “cuss box”

and after two weeks of earnest
“striving and curtailing” on the
part of the above-mentioned of-
ﬁce members, there was enough
money in the box to buy a hand-
some box of candy. The candy
was distributed among the ofﬁce
staff members and one of them
remarked, after tasting the candy,
that he was in favor of “bigger
and better swear words.”

In spite of the fact that the re-
porter consumed two pieces of
the candy, he still lived to write
the story.

Business Review Predicts
Upward Financial Trends

One year iigo Blarcli -A Fraiiklin 1). Roosevelt declared the bank

On lileliriiziry 28 ii year ago, the P'ttsburg'h Busiiiess Review, nionthly
pill)ll(tttll(>ll oi‘ the l'iiivers'ity bureau of business 'researcli, made the
sﬁateineiit that 5-llzllf‘ iiioratoi-iiims in uiziiiy states could be expected
in the very near future, and that “the failure of the baukiiig struc-
ture to i’unctiou properly in these critical times is strikiiig argiinieiit
for the need of banking rei'oriii.” 9

opposite that of last year.

SlIlg‘llla1"l_’y' startling is the fact that
just as financial conditions were drag‘-
ging the nation deeper and deeper in-
to depression last year, they are the
eliief factors in bringing the nation
back toward normalcy this year. Pres-
ident Roosevelt's drastic reorganiza-
tiou of the Iinancizil structure of our
government, which has definitely
wiped out of existence nearly ten
thousand of the weaker banks that
have been falling steadily in ever-
increasing numbers since 1929, re-
versed the downward trend and start-

the Review.

ffunds and an inﬂux of gold that one
year ago was ﬂowing rapidly out of
the country.
‘ Production ﬁgures in every major
;industry in the country are today on

THE PITT NEWS

FRIDAY, MARCH 9. 1934

Pitt__Yars¢ity And Frosh Courtmen, Boxers To

 

 Mountaineers

Four Teams Will 3
Leave Tomorrow
For Morgantown

Four Pitt teams will travel to Mor-
gantown over the week—end to com—.
pete with the \Vest Virginia Mount-
aineers in four sports. On Saturday
night the freshman basketball team
will may the ‘Nest Virginia frosh, the.
varsity will meet the Mountaineers
in a conference game, and the boxers
will trade punches with the VVest
\'irginia ringmen. On Sunday night
the debaters will engage the Mount-
aineers in a verbal tilt. Whether the
last comes under the head of sports
or not is rather questionable, but we
have to be broad minded about it.

Anxious to complete their season in
the Eastern Intercollegiate conference

with a clean record, the Golden
Panthers will meet Coach Sleepy]
Glenn’s quintet in what promises to}
be a tight ball game. 

Pitt’s record of seven straight con-l
ference wins includes a rather easyi
victory over the Mountaineers at the;
Stadium pavilion early this year. The 5
Panthers were in rare form the night
they played the Mountaineers and for
a long time there appeared a possibil-
ity that the West Virginians were go-
ing to go pointless for the evening.

Joe Stydahar and his mates ﬁnally
got going but by that time the Panth-
ers were far ahead. However, meet-
ing the Mountaineers at the Stadium
pa.vilion and meeting the boys down
at Morgantown are two different prop-
ositions. Coach Glenn has a team this
year that has been able to beat most
of the conference rivals in good
fashion. That is, of course, with the
exception of the Panthers.

Pitt will present the same lineup
that played against Temple. This will
have Skip Hughes and McCamant or
Roderick at the forwards, Noon at
center, and Ochsenhirt and Charley
Hughes at the guards.

The Panthers will have to be on the
watch particularly for big Joe
Stydahar, sensational center, and the
forward, Colebank, who have been
scoring plenty of points for the Moun-
taineers lately.

In the preliminary to the varsity
game, Coach Paul Zehfuss’s men will
oppose the little Mountaineers. The
little Panthers boast one victory over
the Morgantowners already this sea-
son.

Panther Boxers Meet Mountaineers

The boxing team is facing a much
greater task in downing the Mountain-
eers than are the two Pitt basketball
teams. Besides the fact that the
Panther team was rather completely
wrecked at mid—semester and Joe
Kopp, 165—pounder still favoring his
broken hand, the \V'est Virginia team.
holds the conference championship.

Coach Orsini has succeeded in
rounding out a team since hard luck
settled down around his doorstep, that
may give the Mountaineers much more
ﬁght than they are expecting.

Charles Carmella will ﬁll the 115-
pound berth opposed by Peter Puglia,
‘West Virginia representative. Either
Konick or Thill will draw the 125-
pound assignment. Espada will be the
opponent in this class.

Jimmy Gianatti will box the VVest
Virginia team’s captain, Bill Neely,
135—pounder. Bernie Spiegel will draw
the 145-pound assignment. Captain
Jack Schricker, conference champ for
the past two years, will meet John
Gallo of ‘West Virginia in the 155-
pound match. In the event that Kopp
should get a doctor’s O. K. on his hand
he will box in the 165-pound match.
(‘oach Orsini may be forced to forfeit
the 165—pound match if Kopp is unable
to perform. The 175-pound match may
also be forfeited.

Regis \Volfe, varsity golf coach will
interview candidates for the freshman
and varsity golf teams, today, follow-
ing the fourth period at the stadium
office.

Freshman golfers are especially re-
quested to attend the interview.

Panthers Enter
Mid-West Meet

Heading west for the first time this
season, the Pitt trackmen left early
today for South Bend, where they
will take part in the Central Inter-
collegiate indoor track meet tonight
and tomorrow.

Coach Olson is pinning great hopes
upon his mile relay team to capture
some points for the Panthers against
the class of the middle west, Al-
though two members of last year’s'
crack team are missing, two soph-
omores, Charley Groat and Harold
Connelly,awill make up a fast quartet
of runners with Fred Kiger and Bill
Keller.

Arvel Fleming, dash star, who did
some very nice work in the IC4A
meet in New York last week, will be
entered in his favorite events at South
Bend. Emil Bonavita will compete in
the shot-put and Cy Pelucha is out
to make a tough competition for the
pole vaulters. Bill Albright will en-
ter the two-mile run.

Trial heats, in all events, with the
exception of the two-mile, will be
run off Friday night. The ﬁnals will
come off before what is expected to
be a banner turnout on Saturday.

Due to inclement weather, which
has handicapped the Navy trackmen,
who must do some of their indoor
track out-of—doors, from completing all
the events in their telegraphic meet
with Pitt, the ﬁnal results of that
meet are not as yet compiled.

Chess Team Meets Today A

This afternoon at 4:30 o’clock the

 

 

the University chess team will meet League “B” for the

the Schenley high school chess team
in the Y hut. It will be the second
meeting of the teams. In a previous
match the Schenley team defeated
the Panthers in the ﬁrst match lost
by the team this year.

Boxers Defeat CCC

The boxers invasion into the CCC
Camp was much more successful than
that of the Panther wrestlers. The
boxers W011 ther match. winning ﬁve
of the eight bouts. The wrestlers
lost their contest 28 to 11.

Swimmers Down Garrick

The frosh swimming team kept its
winning streak intact by defeating
the :Car1-ick high school swimmers in
Trees pool on Vvednesday, 48 to 16.
Coach George Lee’s team won all of
the eight ﬁrst places.

Threat To Deltsl

Must Win Tuesday Night/s G-ame
To Tie Delta Tau For First

 

 

It was the same old story Tuesday
night when Delta Tau Delta defeated
Lambda Chi Alpha by a 23 to 16 score.
The players of Lambda Chi raced from
basket to basket until they were leg-
weary. But like the Phi Gamma Delta
team who also played hard against
the Delts, in their game of February
28, couldn’t quite get past the stone-
wall defense of the winners for the
necessary points.

Hartwig led the league leaders with
11 points, and Kallaway was high for
Lambda Chi Alpha.

Kappa Sigma beat Phi Gamma Delta
24 to 15 in the game following, Groat
being the individual scorer with 16
points for Kappa Sigma, and Wilson

’Vv'illia.m Lewis, Charles

leading his team with 6.

and Sigma Alpha Mu,
Now the only team having a. chance
to even tie Delta Tau Delta is Kappa g
Sigma. If Kappa Sigma can beat thei
Delts they will each have won fours
and lost one. I

Phi Delta Theta, last year’s frater-g
nity champions, and Phi Kappa are!

still tied for ﬁrst place, as a result of j
Wednesday’s game, each are unde-E

John Carik is the only Pitt man en-it

the past two years in championship}
meets, Carik has placed second andé
third, and is one of the best bets to!
place in the ﬁnals.

Inasmuch as only three men from
each school are permitted to compete
in any one event, Corr will be forced.
to scratch two of the entries on his
tentative entry list in the 220, 100, and
the 50-yard freestyle races. The en-
tries in the 220 will be three of the
following ﬁve: Jack Denny, Joe Jones,
William Lewis, Jack Hanna, and Rus-
sell Lindberg. Five men are entered
in the 50 and the 100—yard freestyle
races, which means that two will have
to be withdrawn from each event.
Adlers-berg, Chambers, Stinner, Ruhe,
and Madden are the 50-yard swimmers
from which three will be chosen to
represent the Panthers.
