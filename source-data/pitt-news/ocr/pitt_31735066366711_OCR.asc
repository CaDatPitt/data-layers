 For ‘S’ Award

Assistant Dean of Men Parker Enwright an-

;nounced Wednesday that applications for the S-

Award are now available from Mrs. El-Waziri,
assistant director of the Office of Cultural and
Educational Exchange, in 1101 Bruce Hall. Ap-
‘plicants must return their completed applications

. ‘to the Dean of Men’s Office at 505 SU,by Feb. 28.

‘ ’ The S-‘Award is a grant given to one student

" each year_ for study and travel abroad during

the summer. Last year the grant totaled $750. This
year it will be “at least $600 and probably sub-
-stantially more," according to Enwright.
». The award is open to all male University un-
-udergraduates who have completed four trimes-
te’rs‘o’r more and have at least two more to ﬁnish.
There is no minimum QPA, but grades will be
‘a factor in deciding who will ‘receive the grant.
The S-Award was originated in 1954 by the
Interfraternity Council, and since that time the

number of sponsors has increased to include Stu- V
' "dent Government, Men’s Dorm Council, Omicron
Delta Kappa, and the Dean of Men’s Office. The

selection committee itself includes the . Dean of

 Men as chairman, the presidents of the contribut-
W7 ing organizations, and Dr. George L8t°hW0l‘th.
. chairman of the special fellowship Committee.

The S in the ,Award’s name stands for Sail,

5  See,‘ Speak, and Study. Unfortunately, one of the
3 past awardees assumed that the award was wholly

for travel, which it is not. The awardee must par-
ticipate in a program of “academic signiﬁcance”

- while he is abroad, and will be asked to speak

‘on his experiences after he returns.

 V Sponsors Forum   I 1,,

 

Student Government (SG) entered the current contro-
versy concerning the University's state relatedness and the
retention of the trimester system with the enactment of SG

bill’ R-2.

' The ‘bill provides for -a student poll to be taken by a Sen-
ate committee to discover the student opinion on these is-

sues. Further, SG will present an
open forum for students, which
top representatives of the Admin-
istration, Board of Trustees, and’
State will be invited to attend.

In a strong defensepof the bill,
Senator Gabrielle Edwards, a‘co-
sponsor, stated that “Student
Government should take a stand
on this trimester question. This
is a question that ‘greatly affects
the students and has aroused a
lot of interest.” ‘

Senator Loren Hershey, the
bill’s other sponsor, recommended
that SG accept the proposal “so
that it (SG) begins expressing an
opinion on student affairs.”

That the University should low-
er tuition for both in-state and
out-of-state students and that the
University should maintain its
high academic standards were
other resolutions included in the
legislation. A

A second. bill passed by SG,
establishing a general student
ticket committee to form a ticket

tor Ronald Cowell. This agency
will make arrangements to sell
tickets to University students for
groups and organizations present-
ing events in Pittsburgh. Hope-
fully, according to Cowell, the
-tickets would be available at re-

“The Magnificent Man in the ProductioiniBoloth’i’ c 
by Bill Jerome

Gus Notopoulos smiles at the
size of the Friday night crowd
wedging into his Capitol The-
ater in Altoona, Pa., to see the
local premier of Those Magniﬁ-
cent .Men in] Their Flying Ma-
chines. He is a little worried.

He wonders if it was worth it

to close ﬁve days for redecorat- 7

ing downstairs.'He standsin the
repainted lobby looking for re-
actions to the 500 new seats, th.e
new carpeting, the new candy
stand. It is not a small invest-
ment, and he is planning to re-
ﬁnish the balcony and ceiling
during the summer if the people
keep showing their interest. He

is also anxious to see how they‘

like the movié.

Surrounded by the new and
unproven ﬁxtures, however, he

never once thinks of the work,

of the proven, dependable ﬁx-
tures of the Capitol. Above all,
he is not concerned about the
running of the movie itself, since
that is ‘safely in the trained

hands of one Charles Mccready.

Since 1928, McCready’s hands
have been threading ﬁlms through
the Ca.pitol’s , projectors which,
with the rest of the movie busi-

ness, have modernized consid_er- -

_ ably in 38 years. Now he stands

in the steamy, supernatural
world of‘ the projection booth,
among the sizzling carbon-are
machines and the talcum powder-
like odor they give oﬁ.

Through a small window he

peers down at the screen--“one-
hundred-and-one feet away”

but his main interest is in the
clarity of the picture, the sound
level, and the green ovals that
ﬂash in the upper right corner
of the screen, signaling a change
in reels.

In a long feature such as Mag-
niﬁcent Men, he will tell you,
there are eight or nine reels to
change. This requires the alter-
nate‘ use of two projectors, and
when you are not threading one
you are rewinding the used-up

reel, ‘adjusting or igniting the’

carbon rods, or just checking the
whole system for ﬂaws. This

leaves little time to watch Terry- .

Thomas, but McCread_y is -never

too busy to talk about his own»

ﬁying machines—the projectors
-— while performing his. duties

' without a hitch.

What ﬂies is the ﬁlm, he says,
and in the second he/ has taken

to _ tell you, another-foot-and-a- ‘

half of Magniﬁcent Men has pass-
ed over the ﬁlm gate and onto
the screen. Now .you see why

ﬁlms are nine reels long. But _

there are more interesting things
to tell about, so~McCready hands
you a projector lens and begins
to explain Cinemascope.

He tells you the lens is “ana-
morphic:” it‘ distorts by stretch-
ing the image wider, like a fat-

lady mirror at an amusement
park., But the camera lens dis-
torts vertically when it takesvthe
picture—here he offers a strip
of Cinemascope ﬁlm as proo_§—
with the ﬁnal result being an ex-
tremely"wide picture with pro-
portions,norma1. You nod.
netic sound tracks that run along
He shows_;you the four mag-
the ﬁlm, and tells you that from
these come stereophonic sound.
He pauses to drink from his jar
of ice water,"and you notice the.

heat again. “Two million degrees

in the middle of those carbon
rods!” he yells about the grind-
ing projectors. You don’t know
if he’s serious. But it’s hot.

The squawk of the sound track
gives way to the bells that also sig-

--nal reel changes, andas his hands

lead the ﬁlm swiftly, through
the projector he tells you this is
the last reel. “You, know,” he be-
gins,' “what fascinated me as a,
kid was how they got still pic-
tures to move . L .”

- The reel en’ds quickly, and the .
audience goes home. happy. Mc- -

Cready switches the house lights
on, and then dims them. “It just
remembered that Mr. Notopoulos
didn’t want the people to see the
unﬁnished parts,” he says. Call it
dependability ‘or company pride;
color it maniﬁcent. -

 Rhodesian Crisis .

. A new South Africa is in the making.
. The blame for creating it must lie on the
(British Government and itsreluctance to
~ impose stricter sanctions againstthe Rho-
desian rebels just because the colorpf their
. skin is white. .

The Rhodesian problem came to interna-
V tional prominance when, on November 11,
' 1965, the Government of Rhodesia proclaim-
ed aUnilateral Decla1'ati0n of Independence
‘ (UDI) an act of rebellion against the Brit-
ish Government that put the tiny -minority
of 220,000 whites in rule over the vast ma-
— jority of four million Africans. ,

UDI comes as no surprise. It is, in fact,
a logical continuation of the kind of society
that the Rhodesian Front was building un-

’ der the British. ‘  . V.
 THE ‘NATURE OF Rhodesian society
 before independence must leave a black dot
on «British Colonial history. It not .only“,'de-

denied them social and economic advance-
ment. Restrictions were imposed upon their
movement within the country, and outside
”"the tribal area their life was closely watched
by the police. They could not own land or

, country. They could not live withtheir Ia-

‘-jmil'res near the centre of the cities unless

they were domestic servants. Every form

of political activity, of public meeting, or of

journalism was controlled. Their children’s

propects of more than a simple form of pri-

mary education were slight, although in

other African countries secondary education

is expanding fast. It is for allowing the’
establishment of such a society that Britain’
must now bear the responsibility. ‘

‘ . The liberal white forces within the coun-

try have also been effectively suppressed.

Garﬁeld ‘Todd, an ex-premier of Rhodesia

and the leader ‘of the New Africa Party

which is pledged to the establishment of a

multi-racial state, has been put under an

yearly house resti'icti"dn‘by the rebel gov-

ernment. The “Daily News,” the only lib-

eral paper‘ in the country, has been banned.

If a social scientist examined the mental disposition of the student
body today, he would quickly diagnose a clear case of ariomle. Most students
‘can no longer feel a sense of identity with the University, because they do
not know what it represents. They do not know what direction the Uni-
versity will follow and are therefore equally ignorant ofitheir own status.
, It is time this feeling. stop. Students should voice their opinions
‘strongly on any and all issues relating to new state-affiliation. The Student
Government (SG) resolution backing continuance of high academic stand-
« ards and their proposed forum and poll represent the ﬁrst concrete oppor-
tunity for responsible action by thestudent body on this issue.
It has indeed too long a time_ gap between the rally for ex-chan-
cellor Litchfield last summer and this action. In the interim, student opin-
ion on the University’s future was not ‘only neglected by the University,
but the neglect was accepted by the students.
 Yet, “it’s too late” is not a valid reason not to act now. Those who
retort that the ﬁnal decision rests with the State legislature and Board of
Trustees are only conﬁrming the ignorance of those two groups. A student

reaction may not be the key decision-making factor, but it must be pre-

sented.

Presentation of student opinion will be meaningless unless there is a
well-informed student body and a significant percentage of students pre-
senting the “student body’s opinion.”

1 The poll and forum can achieve this end in part, but must be supple-
mented by individual initiative. Letters should be written by individuals
or student groups to local papers; concerned parents should write letters

to the University, their state representatives, and papers; and students
should consistently base their opinions on facts, not rumors, gossip, and
unsubstantiated‘ reports. ' I,

We feel students have neglected taking a collective stand on this issue
too long. It is their responsibility to ascertain the facts and express a con-

crete, strongly-supported opinion. Students must express what direction

 Test, of British Democracy

by Mahmoud Mamdani

African Nationalist leaders, Nkomo and Sit-
hole, have been restricted. All internal op-
position to white supremacy rule has been
effectively stifled. _

UNDER THESE circumstances, Britain
has chosen to retaliate by‘ implementing eco-
nomic sanctions against the rebel govern-
ment. The most extreme of these measures
is the oil embargo on /Rhodesia. With ra-
tioning, Rhodesia’s existing stock could last
for months. Voluntary efforts are already-
under way in South Africa to supplyVaddi-
tional oil to Rhodesia when the need arises.
It is indeed wishful thinking to assume that
such pinpricks can topple the white supre-
macy in Rhodesia. , ,

Time for effective actionremains short.
All of Africa, north of. the Zambesi, is
watching what happens.in Rhodesia; so are
the countries and. the peoples throughout-
the world. Britain» .has long espoused the

' ideals of "democracy andemaj ority rule for all

peoples. One-wonders, ‘if it will take steps
to implement these, now that a white minor-
ity of British heritage has seized power. Se-
veral African countries have severed dip-
lomatic relations with Britain -in an effort
to denounce the softness of the British, ac-
tions. This, however, is _a tool that can be

‘used only once and these countries Willnot
stand idly by in the .near future. British"

military intervention in Rhodesia must
come very soon. If Britain does not invade
Rhodesia, -others will do it for her -—and
with'bloodier consequences. '

Britain must bear, responsibility for the‘

society it hasvhelped to create in Rhodesia.
It must pledge its efforts towards establish-
ing ‘a democratic rule of the majority with
equal opportunities for all Rhodesian citi-
zens. The four million Africans cannot be
condemned to life-long subordination under
a minority white rule. Britain undertook
military intervention in Aden and against
the black Mao a0‘ reb_ellion in Kenya. It is
now time this step be taken in Rhodesia.
That the Rhodesian‘ rebel are white should
make no difference. a - " ’

Doesn’t it seem a bit rediculous
for the administration to force
sophomore girls, ambitious enough
to go for a third trimester, to
spend the hottest days of the year
in the un-air-conditioned suites of
Amos Hall (possibly holding ten
rather than the normal eight girls
in each suite) when they _could
be staying in air-conditioned, sin-

place, Tower C will house, besides
upper-class and gradllate women,
in-coming freshmen for orienta-
tion—-a period of three days dur-
ing which they spend most of their
time at planned activities and
testing away from their rooms,
rather than studying as the sopho-

The Einstein-Schroedinger

Common sense tells us that time has‘an arrow
that points in one direction only. However, physi-
cists are generally not satisﬁed by common sense 7
justiﬁcations and they seek to relate the irrever-
sibility of time to general physical theory. _
Since the early 20th century the work of Ein-
,stein and Minkowski has revealed that our older
 notions of separate space and time are an inade-
- quate representation of the physical world.
, In contrast to the Newtonian concept of an
.-absolute time separate from. an absolute space
ﬂ we must think of space and time as a uniﬁed
continuiom of a four dimensional geometry. In
thisfour dimensional system all matter extended
 in space is extended likewise in time.
A Professor de Beauregard espouses a particular
type of determinism, he terms it fatalism, by
‘_which all events are pre-determinately written
out in the unchangeable space and time continuum.
He is not, however,‘to be included with those the-
4 oreticians who presently seekhidden parameters

It elude to a deterministic rather than a statistical
interpretation of quantum phenomena.

cirepresentative of such a sought-for deterministic
_ explanation. Essentially, they arose from the un-
 expected data observed in particle state measure-
 ment. The data seemed to refute a cardinal con-
‘ -tention of quantum mechanics that certain pairs
of properties of a particle state could not sim-
ultaneously be observed. Dr. de Beauregard ‘does
; not accept the alleged result as strong evidence
 for a deterministic interpretation of quantum meg ‘
chanics nor does he at all advocate a tempered
version of the hidden variables theory.

Hears Parisian Philosopher  

By SUZAN AND JOSEPH DIVACK
_ Professor 0. Costa de Beauregard of the In-
stitut Henri Poincare of Paris spoke on the philo-
sophy’ of time Monday night at the Philosophy
of Science lecture series. An eminent theoretical
physist_ and philosopher of science, the speaker
attempted to ﬁnd a solution to the apparent ir-
reversiiblity of time, a subject of much current

Some physicists pointed to the behavior of
antiparticles in a reaction as evidence ‘against the
irreversibility of time doctrine. Recently, however,
Dr. Irving Feynman of the California Institute of
Technology suggested convincingly that the back-
ward ﬂow of antiparticles in time is apparent
rather than real.

The speaker, like many other philosophers of

science, uses concepts from thermodynamics to

abilistic laws.

establish an ego-free deﬁnition of time. In the
lecture he pointed out that the problems of ir-
reversibilty in thermodynamics are ultimately re-
lated to abstract probability and statistics.
Thermodynamics seeks to explain irreversib-
ility speciﬁcally by the law of entropy increase.
Entropy can be deﬁned as movement of a system
from a state of disorder to a state of relative order.’
The explanation of irreversibility by the law of
‘entropy increase is reciprocal to, not mutually
exclusive of, the explanation as given by prob-

According to the speaker, another‘ fundamental
principle, that of causality, also rests on postulates
of statistics. The statistical interpretation of ir-
reversibility ispof a factlike not a lawlike char-

The above mentioned probabilistic interpreta-
tion of casuality is to be identiﬁed with entropy
increase in a one-to-one relation. Time itself has
a relation to entropy in that subjective time. ﬂow
follows the thermodynamic principle of going al-
ways up and not down the entropic curve.

Professor de Beauregard believes that informa-
tion theory, or cybernetics, is a key to the‘ irre-
versibility of time problem because cybernetics
assists the understanding of probability theory.
As has been previously stated, probability theory
and thermodynamics are intimately connected as
corroborations for the irreversible time ﬂow argu-

Dr. de Beauregard concluded that in this cen-
tury the gradual rapprochment of the special
theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and cy-

 bernetics, will initiate _an intellectual .revolution
/ comparable in scope only to the revolution caused
by the introduction of the_Copernican system.

“A FAREWELL TO ARMS”,

Beano Cook felt the football coaches should be ﬁred, the
football coaches felt Beano Cook should be ﬁred—the foot-
ball coaches are gone. Carroll H. Cook, Pitt Sports Informa-
tion director, is also leaving but of his own accord. His last
day ‘on the job will be Feb. 28, and he’s lucky to get out alive.

Players have pounded on his door after football games
and the coaches‘ have been wan-ting his head .for the _ten
years he has been here. Beano Cook is leaving to take a pub-
lic relations job with ABC, and the coaches couldn’t be
happier. i/_

He told John Michelosen and his staff that he thought

they should be ﬁred. He has told coaches now on the staff -

that they should be ﬁred. Every person connected with
Beanoéknows how he feels about them. He won’t win any
most popular awards, but that is the price he has to pay
for telling the truth. . ‘

As publicity man for the University he was supposed
to be a good will ambassador and heap nothing but praise
on dear old Pitt. When dear old Pitt 'didn’t deserve to be
given laurels he didn’t make up fairy tales. During his ten-
ure here there have been very few times when the Athletic
Department hasn’t needed a couple of sharp jabsto the chin.

It's not that Beano Cook isout to put the knock on
everything around him, but there are some things that real-

, ly bother him. -One of these things is the foreign language
requirement at Pitt.

E, . “It is idiotiq and assinine to have to take two years of

a foreign language. Somebody just made it a requirement
to impress somebody ‘else’ higher up.” Incidently, according
to Beano, he won the Latin Award a.t....Kiski Prep School.
He has long been a critic_ of tl1’ji’ef;‘:football program and
has adopted a wait and see attitude. “John “ Michelosen
couldn’t do ‘the job with this program, and if Dave Hart
_ can’t do a good 'job_ that: meanstwo "guys have failedand
the system has to _be reevaluated,” said Beano.
V The other sports are in worse shape than football, -ac-
cording to Beano’. “We only had two winning teams last year,
baseball and cross-country. We’re going to have to give bet-
ter scholarships for the minor sports.” _  "  7 _.
“Besides football and basketball, which are great spec-
tator sports, I can’t blame the students for not coming to
sports events. All we offer them {is “mediocrity.”  

In his ten years here Beano has made some observa-
tions about the people with which he has been associated.
FRANK CARVE‘R——“for honesty'E‘aj'n_d tegrity he can’t b

matched. .If he has a fault it"i“s““he’*'is‘ too sof .”- ‘

Lr

   

      

EDWARD LITCHFIELD —— “dynamic and an honor toe

know; but -he surrounded himself in most ‘cases with
_ incompetents.” ‘ - . . — ~
V JOHN MICHELOSEN-—‘.‘a true gentlemen, but. he couldn’t
motivate his players.” V ~ _  ‘  ~ ‘
DAVE HART——“I' haven’t known him or seen him long
enough to know how goodafootball. _coach~he_ is, but
he has shown me he can.motivate and that is 50 per
cent of football.” ~ . x »

(As for the future, somechanges are called for. by Beano.
“Frank Carver hasa problem of what to do with the coaches
who aren’t good. We have to improve our minor sports.

9 This might come easier if we go state-"related because a

golfer or gymnast might come here if h-e only has to pay

$450 and can’t get a scholarship.” _ .

The future Won’t be as controversial with Beano gone,
but those whogcan look at him objectively have to respect
him for his principles. He wanted Pitt to win as __much as
the rest of us. . ‘ 1 - A ‘

There was the thrill of 1963, when Pitt beat Penn State,

‘ o

9:

22-20, to ﬁnish 9-1, and laterthat evening defeated Du- .

quesne forvthe Steel Bowl Championship, 69-67. Or in 1956,
when Bill Kaliden ran across the Notre Dame goal line
with-11 seconds to go to defeat the Irish, 29-26.

There were disappointments too. The 1962 football team
that was better than their 5-5'record, or the embarrasing
losses of this year. » / '

' “Those were my greatest and saddest moments at Pitt.”

Invisible Man
Gives Cagersl
Another Loss

Those, who -think that the
invisible man is Purely 3
creation of science fiction
buffs would have been
amazed at what they saw

in the 83-73 loss to the Syra-
cuse basketball team Thursday
night. . _

There was a phantom on the
court last night. He scored 31
points and he’s a shoe-in for All-
American honors. His name is
Dave Bing. M ,

The Orange ace ‘appeared to
be everywhere at once. He was
under the basket, in the corner,
at the foul line and in the midst
of the scrambles. His speed and
quick passes made his presence
seem a —blurr, especially ‘to thé
tired Panthers.

“He’s one of those great ones
all right,” 'sa.id- coach Bob Tim-
mons. “He has that certain touch.
When -he takes a shot it doesn’t
seemlike it 'has\a chance to drop
in but somehow it hangs up
there and curves right ‘in. Physi-
cally he doesnit look like a great
player, but he acts like one.”

Despite Bing’s performance, the
highest scoring team in the na-
tion was almost caught napping
last night. At one point in the
second half the score was, tied
up, 48-48, and Syracuse was run-
ning scared. Then Bing took com-
mand. Pouring in 14 points in a
six minute spree, the senior whiz
"pushed the score up to 72-59
with some help from his team-
mates. 7 e
“We were the ﬂatest I’ve ever
seen us look,” said Syracuse
coach Fred Lewis.-«. ‘_‘The boys
have been talking about the West,
Virginia game on Saturday so
much I guess they almost forgot
about Pitt.” -
Larry Szykowny’s ﬁne perform
ance from the outside plus Bill
Buck’s surprise showing in the
pivot spot brought the Orange-A‘
men quickly down to earth,‘ —
Szykowny’s » pop-ins. netted him
18 points for the night. It was

2-

« his steal and two successive lay-

'ups in the..se_’cond half that knot-
ted the score at 48-48.
It was mainly» due "to- Buck’s
manuvers around the. key that
kept the Panthers close. in the‘
ﬁrst half. He ﬁnished up the
game with‘l1 points. Because. of
Buck’s \ rebounding under the
boards Jim L'aValley was free to
roam around a little bit more
than normal. He also scored quite
.a lot more points than is nor-
than for him, 17.  
“Buck and Szykowny were
keeping us‘ in there,” said Tim-
mons. -“But they were getting
tired in thesecond half and just
couldn’t hang on. The boards
killed us again.”

afraid it won't do much good,” '
said Johnson." I

A good crowd is expected for
the Eastern powerhouse, but as
Johnson said, “They’ll all be root-
ing for Lehig .”

The wrestlers had some magic
of their own working for them
last Wednesday when they taught
West Virginia a lesson, 23-8. It
was their.second victory of the
season. It was a ﬁtting victory
"since the night before the Moun-
taineer basketball team had run
the Panthers right out of Mor-
gantown, 103-63.

After the meet some West Vir-
ginia fan walked up to Johnson
and accused him of trying to
pour it’ on. “This ‘was a real
grudge match wasn’t it?” said
the rfan. ' /

“I just looked at him. I could-

Depth, the nemesis of the track team for the past two
weeks, should be no hinderance in tomorrow’s meet, for
Penn State has the same problem. The runners will host the
Nittany Lions .in the Field House at 1 p.m.

The Panthers have lost their last two meets by a com-

teams. A difference in volume . .

‘The State tracksters have about
as many runners on their team
as the Panthers, and Rees has
the home track advantage. “_This

The idea’s not as crazy as it may seem.

Anytime we take a jet up, there are almost
always leftover seats. '

So it occurred to us that we might be able
to, fill a few of them, if we gave the young
peopleia break on the fare, and a chance to
see the country.

The American Youth." Plan*

We call the idezrthe American Youth Plan,

I and whattit means is this: ‘ _ .

American will pay half the jet coach fare
for anyb0dy~12 through 21.

It’s that simple.

All you have to do is prove your age (a birth

certificate or any other legal documentwill do) V .
and buy a $3 identiﬁcation card. ’
V We date and stamp the card, and this en-'

titles you to a half-fare ticket at any American
Airlines counter. ~

The only catch is that you might have t0\.,

wait before you get aboard; the fare is on a
standby basis. ‘

_ “Standby” simply means that the pas-
sengers with reservations and the servicemen
get on before you do. '
