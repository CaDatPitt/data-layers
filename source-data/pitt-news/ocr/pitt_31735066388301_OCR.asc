Student leaders had a chance yesterday
to question Robert M. Berdahl, the first
candidate announced as a finalist to
succeed Pitt President Wesley Posvar, about
his views on pertinent campus issues.

Student Govemrnent Board President
Brent Saunders asked Berdahl, presently
the vice chancellor for Academic Affairs at
the University of tllinois at l.7rbana—
Champaign, how he would resolve
conflicts between the research and
academic sectors of Pitt.

‘The is no question that at times faculty
feel torn,‘ Berdahl said, ‘between their
commitment to research and their
obligation to teaching. lPittl is a university
that has a wide range of commitments,
and I don't think those commitments need
to be seen as competitive of one another. '

Berdahl said ‘salary differentials between
disciplines lat colleges] has grown,‘ and

String of related theﬁs
strike campus buildings

this contributes to tension.

The liberal arts sector often ‘feels
underappreciated and undersupported,'
he said, but a university should be a
community bound together by a set of
academic values.

Stressing the importance of research,
Berdahl added, ‘I think that we have the
right to expect that we have the same
excellence [in undergraduate education
alsol.”

Black Action Society Chairperson Doug
Ligons and Saunders asked Berdahl to
address affirmative action and minorities
on campus.

‘I think it is important to realize that
affirmative action is action," lierdahl said.
‘It is acting affirmatively at each level of
the institution. It is the commitment to
equal opportunity, and when that
opportunity presents itself, to act
affirmatively on behalf of minorities and
women.‘

He said, however, that a specific office
is not where affirmative action takes place.

‘If we are going to make progress on
affirmative action  that has to take place
at the departmental level, and that will
take the commitment of people up and
down the administration. I don’t look to
the solution to minority hiring to be
resolved by the affirmativeaction office.
That is a cop—out. It has to be a problem for
everybody,‘ Berdahl said.

In 1985, the year before Berdahl arrived
at the University of Illinois, the
administration created the President’s
Award Program, in which any black or
Hispanic student who scored more than
24 on the AC1‘ test and placed within the
top halfof his or her class can receive full
financial support based upon financial
need.

'lhe University of Illinois has a Minority
Student Affairs Office, which reports to
Berdahl. He said, ‘I am really torn about
the issue of having lthisl office, because I
see both sides of the issue. I worry a great
deal about the segregation of the campus.

In the past month, 32 related
thefts have been reported in
campus buildings, including
libraries.

Gary Moses, assistant director
of investigations and special
services for Pitt's Department of
Public Safety, called this “a trend
of sneak thefts and crimes of
opportunity. "

These thefts occurred when
personal belongings were
unattended, often for extremely

short periods of time, according
to Moses.

“When a person leaves their
office, they often leave their purse
or wallet on their desk, in their
briefcase, under their desk or in a
drawer. Someone can walk in, go
directly to the desk, go for the
purse and get out. 'lhat’s in a
matter of seconds," he said.

Moses said he believes the thefts
are related because they have
similar traits and occur at about
the same time, usually in the early
afternoon.

Health expert shares secrets of success

By Jackie Estkowski
snag’ Writer

'Ihe secret of success is to expect success, fitness
expert Pat Croce told a Pitt audience yesterday.

Croce, a 1977 graduate of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Health Related Professions,
delivered a lecture entitled, ‘The Greatest Secret of
Success‘ in the Kurtzman Room of the William Pitt
ljnion.

"the lecture, which promoted mental and physical
health, was the first of a series of Pitt's Distinguished
Alumni Lectures sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh's Alumni Association.

"there are ‘seven P5‘ to Croce's success program:
purpose, passion, positive mental attitude, plan,
push, patience and pride.

Croce said the common denominator is purpose.

'Don‘t limit yourself,‘ said Croce. ‘Dream many
dreams; set many goals, and enjoy the fulfillment
of those goals.’ Croce said that people must write
their dreams down and verbalize them in order to
attain them

Croce. who presented a slide show with his
lecture. showed a slide of Philadelphia Phillies star
Mike Schmidt, who came to Croce with a limp.
Croce said Schmidt had a purpose.

‘He believed he could be MVP and hit over 500.’

said Croce. ‘He had discipline and devotion to
commit to this dream, and he did it.‘

Croce also stressed that it's never too late to start
a ﬁtness program.

‘Fitness has no boundaries,‘ he said.

The next ‘P,’ passion, ensures success, Croce
said.

‘Tennis star Martina Navratilova, for example,
has a passion for the game," he said. ‘She does it
for the love of the game.‘

A positive mental attitude, the third ‘P,’ determines
attitude, said Croce. ‘If you believe in yourself,
your dreams and the achievement of your dreams,
you can do anything,‘ he said. ‘There are only two
things in this world that won’t last: dogs chasing
cars and people gaining success without a positive
mental attitude.‘

Croce said to put the next ‘P,’ plan, in writing
and to have others who have achieved success as
role models.

Push, the fifth ‘P,’ is motivation. Croce used
cycler Greg Leivlond as an example. The year
before the Tour de France, LeMond had knee
surgery and an appendectomy. Yet he participated
in the race and won.

The next ‘P‘ is patience. ‘Patience is simply
waiting to accumulate knowledge and experience,‘

Investigate!

Does anyone care about

Uh-oh. Once again, The Pitt News has fallen
out of step with popular opinion, the “respect-

” able" media and the powers—that-be.

After a recent trip to Iraq, peace activist and
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark told Pitt
students President Bush should be impeached.
Last Thursday, The Pitt News unsigned editorial
suggested Bush should be investigated for war
crimes.

What’s that, you say? How dare those wild-
eyed freaks at 7he Pitt News cast aspersions on
the 87-percent approval-rated Most Popular
President in History! Why aren’t they being
good lapdogs like the rest of the media, telling
thigh-slapping anecdotes about Norman
Schwarzkopf and demonizing Saddam Hussein?

It's a tribute to the Republican Party’s exper-
tise in manipulating public perception that you
can’t question the integrity of the Executive
Office without being branded a leftist, a bleed-
ing heart or, my personal favorite, someone
who just doesn’t like America. So when a guy
like Clark makes charges against Bush, he’s
written off as a lunatic or traitor without a sec-
ond thought.

Bush learned well from Reagan, the Great
Communicator; the man plays the media like a
piano. (Note the increase in press conferences
the moment approval ratings went up.) A prin-
cipal component of the Republicans’ image
strategy is a common enemy. First, there was
Willie Horton; last year's Satan was Manuel’
Noriega. Now, it’s Saddam Hussein.

Of the current postwar climate, Michael Kinsey
writes, “There is a blinding moral self-righ-

Dmitri ,
Ragano

 

lteousness that keeps us from seeing what’s

going on before our eyes.”

This blinding self-righteousness originated in
the White House. Certainly no one denies
Saddam’s monstrosities, but is George Bush in a
position to pass moral judgments? ‘

"“ Let’s see, quick history check; Bush headed

the CIA in the mid—1970s, right after it helped
Augusto Pinochet overthrow popular rule in
Chile and establish a terrifying dictatorship.
Around this time the CIA was also training the El
Salvadoran army, which has killed 70,000 civil-
ians since 1979, and the Guatemalan army, which
has destroyed 622 villages and killed over 100,000
civilians since 1978. . V
The real investigation of Bush’s war crimes

should have come a year ago, when Bush in-
vaded Panama to retrieve his old cm employee
Manuel Noriega (undoubtedly one of the more
destructive boss/worker conflicts in history).
America’s Watch estimates between5,000 and
7,000 Panama.nians were killed in the invasion,
not to mention the devastation of entire resi-
dential areas. Did the media, the public or anyone
else care about all these dead Panamanians? Not
really. Only one newspaper in the country
covered the story: the San Francisco Bay ’

the realities of Bush’s War?

Guardian. (There were, however, plenty of
articles on'Bush’s new “un-wimpy” image.)
Clark gave extensive reports of civilian dam-
age. In the city of Diwaniya, the central town
square had been bombed, along with residen-
tial areas. In Basra, densely populated housing
projects were bombed and the central market of
more than 1,000 shops was hit at midday. The
country’s water system was destroyed, and some
sources estimate 6,000-plus deaths from con-
taminated water. While we celebratevictory,
doctors all over Iraq are working by candlelight
in pre-industrial conditions. '
Skeptics will point out that Clark is just seeing
what Saddam wants him to see. This is probably
true, but does that mean the rest of Iraq is hiding
behind some curtain eating wine and cheese?
Our job _as good Americans (or good journal-
ists) isn’t to suck up everything the media tell us
or to go whichever way the wind blows. Just
because you don’t see tens of thousands of
smoldering Iraqi corpses on the cover ofTime
and Newsweele doesn’t mean they aren’t there.

I don’t know whether Bush should be im-
peached for what’s happened in Iraq, but let’s
not pretend that we’re tarnishing the image of
some great, pure man by suggesting it. And let’s
not pretend that Ramsey Clark and7he PittNews
are ready for the funny farm because they pro-
claim the emperor buck naked. Most impor-
tantly, let’s not deny the obvious: The U.S.
foreign policy is unethical, inhumane and not
something to be proud of. ,

Pitt News.

Government abuses the power of "anti—trust laws

It was recently announced that

companies which become “too big”

over, it is often because of inefficient

Pennsylvania state legislators might
pass antitmst legislation. Pennsyl-
vania is the only state that does not
have such legislation.

According to supporters of anti-
trust and anti-takeover laws, the
purpose of such regulation is to
prevent monopolies. However, I
would like to argue against this
with two major points. First, such
laws actually reduce competition.
Second, in an unregulated free

Daniel
Alman  

market, there is absolutely no way
that a monopoly can survive.

In a free market, when a com-
pany gets big, it is because it attracts

good product at a good price. But
with antitrust laws in existence,

can be punished by the /govern-
ment. This protects inferior com-
panies from their higher—quality
competition.

Anti-takeover laws have a very
similar effect. If one company
somehow gets a hold of another
company, it means that the new
management of the company which .
is taken over can manage it better
than its previous ownership could
have. When a company is taken

management. Anti-takeover laws
simply shield inefficient manage-
ment from the outside world.

My other argument is that in an
unregulated free market, monopo-
lies cannot survive.

Let’s say that a’particular company
somehow acquires every single
furniture store in Pittsburgh. The
company now has a monopoly.

Because there is no competition,
the company raises its prices and
lowers its qllalityof service. When
this happens, consumers will want
other furniture sellers.

In addition, the higher price of

, 4 furniture will attract new sellers into

the market. _

The only way that the furniture
company. could keep its monopoly
would be if the government out-
lawed competition. Thereare many
ways that this could be done.

Licensing and permit require-
ments, zoning, limits on store op-
erating hours, taxes, import quotas,
tariffs, wage and price controls and
all sorts of other government regu-
lations could prevent competition
from entering into the marketplace.

Here are some examples of the
government protecting monopolies
from competition. AT&T was a
monopoly because the federal

- government had outlawed compe-
‘Uﬁon.

Port Authority of Allegheny
County is a monopoly because it is
illegal for private companies to of-
fer mass transit in Pittsburgh.

— The U.S. Postal Service has a mo-

nopoly on the delivery of first-class

mail because it is illegal for private

POINT

 

Affirmative action helps
ease discrimination...

A discussion about affirmative
action is similar to a child’s bedtime
story. Special groups go bump in
the night; quotas eat innocent
children, and the monsters get
special rights.

Mark Smith

Sometimes when I am discuss-
ing affirmative action, I am amazed
by the fairy tale that people have
been fed about this bugbear. There’s
a damn good reason for affirmative
action. The problem with this de-
bate is that we do not remember
what life was like before the femi-
nist and civil—rights movements.

Back in 1975, Judge Gerald
Weber instituted an affirmative-
action plan for the city police. A
lawsuit on behalf of the common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, the Na-
tional Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People, the
National Qrganizatio_n_for.,Women
and others forcedlthe city to hire

-officers in groups of four (one

white female, one black female, i

one black male and one white
male), Only the best applicants
from each group were hired,

Affirmative action has been insti-
tuted to remedy ‘past discrimina-
tion. According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, when the affirmative-
action program began in 1975, the
city police force had not hired a
woman since 1966 or a black since
1971. Even though discrimination
was illegal, equal opportunity was
not a reality. The current police
force is 65.5 percent white males,
15.9 percent black males, 10.5 per-
cent black females and 9.6 percent
white females. I

On Wednesday, March 20, Chief "

District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr.
overturned an affirmative-action

- program concerning the hiring of

Pittsburgh police. Five white male

officer candidates filed a lawsuit
claiming the practice was discrirni—
natory. Cohill maintained that the
pattern of discriminatory hiring’
doesn’t exist. However, he ac-
knowledged that dissolution of the
program could probably result in
more white males being hired. Thus,
we may find ourselves back at
square one.

The major criticism of affirmative
action is that employers may have
to reject qualified white males who
are not responsible for discrimina-
tion. This is sometimes called “re-
verse discrimination.” These five
white male candidates may not be
responsible for past injustice;
however, they have also historically
benefited from it. To do nothing
would be, in essence, an argument
for continued discrimination.

Unless America wants to undergo
another Civil War, the American
pie is going to have to be cut in
different portions. The plan insti-
tuted in 1975 made sense, but I
cannot support blind quotas.
Throwing points on test scores or
“race norrning” is not the answer.
But individual merit is not the only
fair basis on which to make em-
ployment decisions. An individual
should not automatically qualify for
a job position just ‘because he or
she receives the highest score on a
test. Affirmative action can undo
past injustice and promote equality
in the workplace.

I also cannot tolerate the ‘quota

red herring. I am tired of it. The
same old‘ ‘faces squawk about
quotas as if every corporation in
America were_headed by women
and minority males. I realize that
affirmative action is only a tempo-
rarysolution to ongoing problems
in the United States. Pitting work-
ing-class white males against
women and minority males only
undermines everyone’s chance to
get a fair slice of the pie,

Mark Smith is a columnist for

The ‘Pitt News. .

fffbq

...But does it really ease ;

problems for minorities?

Well, the ﬁght against discrirni- ‘

nation has suffered another setback
— this time with a different twist.
The Democrats in the House Judi-
ciary Committee rejected a Repub-
lican attempt to halt the practice
known as “race norming.”

In “race norrning,” white, black,
Hispanic and Oriental applicants
take a test called the General Apti-
tude Test Battery, which is used by
most state,-employment agencies.

If all of the applicants receive
equal scores of 300, blacks would
be listed as receiving scores in the
83rd percentile; Hispanics would
be in the 67th, and the whites and
Orientals would receive a score of
44.

The vote on the amendment was
a straight party-line vote, with 21
Democrats against the change and
13 Republicans in favor.

The bill, proposed by Rep. Henry
Hyde (R-111.), would have had the
following stipulations: “It shall be
an unlawful employment practice
for an employer, an employment
agency or public employment ser-
vice, in connection with the selec-
tion or referral of applicants or
candidates for employment or
promotion, to adjust test scores on
the basis of race, sex, religion or
ethnicity." . .

- That seems very fair to me, and
by that wording, nobody would be
discriminated against.‘ So what’s
wrong? -

People havetried to justify “race
norming” by saying that itmakes
up for racial—discrirnination prac-

tices in hiring; I don’t know about 

you, but ifI was a businessperson,
I would want the best person for
the job even if he or she were purple.

And the last time I checked, Ori-
entals were a minority. But I guess
the Democrats cater only to spe-
ciﬁc ones. ‘

Others willsay “race norming" is .
necessary because it compensates ,
for the blacks’ or Hispanics’ poor V

childhood orenvironment But who

is to say that the whites or Orientals
didn't come from a bad background?

I think it is actually insulting to
blacks and Hispanics to assume that
they all come from low-income

Gary
Houston

families. Anyway, someone’s
background isn't a good enough
excuse to justify raising his or her
test score. V I

Hiring should be conducted on
merit alone. Race should not be-
come an issue in anyway. .\

Why should a white or Oriental
stand the chance of losing a job
opportunity just because of his or
her skin color or race? Everyone
should have the same chance at a
job.

The adoption of this amendment, _  
would actually reduce discrirnina-,  V 

tion, but some public figures (Jesse
Jackson?) would have you believe
that any legislation protecting the

rights of people other than blacks . 5 C‘ I

or Hispanics is actually racist.Civil
rights work both ways.

I believe the Democraltsare dig-
ging themselves a very deep hole.
With the combined effect of their

timid and proven-wrong votes on 7

the Persian Gulf war and their

practice of putting the rights of }'_;

certain minorities above those of

everybodyselse, I think that they are I i i

going to be in hot water, or better‘

yet, unemployed, come the. next’

elections.

ment regulations have prevented

I could go on and on and on. But
in summary, every single monopoly
that has ever lasted has done so
because of some government regu-
lation that outlawed competition.

And isn't it just a wee bit strange
that none of these government-
protected monopolies, such as the
U.S. Postal Service, has ever been
the target of an antitrust suit?

In theory, any time two busi-

nesses interact, their actions could

be considered a violation of anti- .

trust laws.

The decision of whether or not

to take legal action against a par-

ticular _company is based mainly

on political inﬂuence.

If the owners of a company don’t
like what one of their competitors
is doing, then they can give a bribe

-(or “campaign contribution"-) to

some government official who will
then use the antitrust laws to attack
the competing business.

In summary, the antitrust and anti-
takeover laws are a hoax. They
exist to increase political power

and to protect inefficient businesses
from their more efficient competi-
tion. These laws should be abol-

   

ished. I -

Pitt tennis is back in full swing after two convincing
home victories ths week. The men hammered Fairmont
State College 90 yesterday, and the women crushed
inter-city rival Duquesne 7-2 on Tuesday.

The men, coming off a 90 win over St. Vincent College
last Thursday, are gaining momentum and confidence
with seven more matches to go, according to Coach
George Dieffenbach.

Neither of the past two opponents were ‘exceptionally
strong,‘ according to the everoptimistic Dieffenbach,
who is hoping to win a record 14 games.

Currently 9-7, the team is shooting for the 1925 team's
13-0 record.

‘Obviously, we can never achieve a 13-0 record, but we
very realistically can win 14,‘ he said.

A tough road lies ahead, however; the team still must
face stronger opponents such as Youngstown State and
the University of Buffalo.

"This is the calm before the tough competition at the

Recent wins in ise tennis teams’ season expectations

end,‘ Dieffenbach said ‘We can be more aggressive and
not worry in these matches.‘

This aggressive attitude was evident in the singles
results. Every Pitt player won in straight sets, with the
exception of .\'o. 2 player larry Garrard, who defeated
Sergio Mucino 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.

The straight-set victories were recorded by .\'o. I
singles player Eric Weaver and Jeff Mills, John Tegano,
Terry O'Connor and David Cinder.

Another sign of Pitt dominance was the ‘pro-set‘
doubles matches.

Since Pitt had already clinched a victory in the singles
matches, both coaches agreed to play all doubles matches
to eight.

In this fashion, all three Pitt doubles teams won. The
most convincing win was by the No. 2 doubles team of
Joel Orth and .Garrard, who pounded Fairmont State's
Lenard Mclntosh and Mucino, &2.

The women defeated Duquesne by maintaining a
balanced attack, losing only one singles and one doubles
match.

The first five singles players all won: Julie I.oPrinzi,

 

Erika Devins, Jill Cohen, Barb McCarthy and Chris Orie.
The lone singles loss was recorded by Josie .\'eiswenter,
who lost to Amy Arthur 6~l, 63.

The doubles matchm were played ‘pro-set‘ style. The
only Pitt doubles loss was by the No. 3 duo of Rachel
Graham and Karen Rearick, who lost to their Duquesne
opponents 8-4.

‘Everybody put forth a strong effort, and this was a

 

good confidence-builder,‘ Dieffenbach said of the victory. *

With four matches left, the women's record stands at 8-
10, already an improvement over last year's 7-9 mark.

‘We have more depth this year, and we’ve developed
more players,‘ Dieffenbach said.

Despite the improvement, Dieffenbach is wary of the
team's next four matches.

‘I want our team to play each match point per point,
and not look too far ahead,‘ he said. "Our goal is to win
three ofthe next four. In my book, a 11-1] finish or 12-
10 finish is acceptable.‘

The women return to action at home against Carnegie
Mellon on Monday, and the men's next game is slated for
Tuesday, April 2, at CM.

Gymnast’s determination pays

By Rob Pugliese
stag Writer

Four years ago, women's
gymnastics coach Debbie
Yohman took a big gamble that
is now paying dividends. Jeannie
Vecchio is grateful that she did.

As a junior at Fox Chapel High
School, Vecchio was training for
the Elite level in gymnastics when
she blew out her left knee and
underwent reconstructive
surgery.

Before the injury, Vecchio had
been focusing her future on such
places as Arizona State University,
University of Alabama and the
University of Utah.

But because of the injury's
seriousness and the subsequent
surgery, Vecchio found herself
with limited options for a
gymnastics scholarship.

‘It was hard for colleges to
actually takeariskon me.Coming
back was so diffiailt,' Vecchio
said

Then Yohman entered the
picture. She talked with Vecchio

~ and offered her a full scholarship

to Pitt, despite the fact that
Vecchio might never perform
here.

‘I didn't expect [the
scholarshipl at all because of the
big risk, since I hadn't done
anythingtherestof my junior or
senior years,‘ Vecchio said

Vecchio wasn't certain that she
could come back from the injury.
Psychologically, she needed a
boost that would restore her
conﬁdence.

‘Pittimtettiwttx

With a little encouragement
from assistant coach Ben Rovee,
she began working on a routine
for the uneven bars in her
freshman year, and it was then

.that she realized her comeback

would be a success. Competing
on bars, she won every meet that
season, including the regional
championships with a score of
9.5. She was the first Pitt gymnast
in four years to qualify for NCAA
Championships.

She also set a school record on
the balance beam ayinst West
Virginia with a score of 9.5.

As a sophomore she expected
to compete in the floor exercise,
but a stress fracture quickly ended
those hopes. She competed only
on bars and admitted that this
was a difficult time to endure.

‘It was painful. I wanted to do
floor lexercisel. The stress fracture
was also painful, but the team
really needed me to do bars.‘

Vecchio went undefeated on
bars in dual-meet competition,
but she did not qualify for NCAA.s.
‘My sophomore year ended a
little earlier than I had really
hoped,’ she said

On the second day of practice
in her junior year, Vecchio twisted
both of her ankles.

This developed into a serious
sprain of her right foot, and the
pain persisted continually. She
was diagnosed as having

tendinitis and missed the entire
season. Vecchio was redshirted
and will compete as a fifth-year
senior next year.

All of these setbacks made her
more determined to succeed, and
Vecchio credited Yohman with
keeping her spirits high.

‘She's helped me a lot in giving
me support, pushing me, helping
me back when I was down and
uncertain ifl could come back,‘
Vecchio said.

Over the past su mmer Vecchio
worked very hard on vault and
floor exercise. She said this led to
her strong start this season. ‘I
came in knowing that I wanted
to do all-around this year," she
said.

This year her scores have
improved in every meet, from
35.8 to 38.05. The latter figure is
the second—best all-around score
in Pitt history, behind Lisa Shirk's
38.15. set in 1984.

‘I wanted to break (38151 so
bad, but I know I'll get it at
regionals next Saturday,‘ Vecchio
said.

Last weekend at the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Championships held at Pitt,
Vecchio turned in a spectacular
performance, finishing sixth on
bars with a score of 9.55, fifth on
floor exercise with a 9.6, third on
beam with a 9.4, and second in
the all-around.

‘I was happy with my
perfomtance. I went into the
meet mainly concentrating on
the team. I knew that if I did well
individually that it would help

the tearn,' said Vecchio. ‘My
main goal was for the team to be
No. 1. I just wanted to go in and
hit four solid events, and that's
what] did I guess I can’tbe too
disappointed with being second
all-around.‘

"Jeannie's performance has
been incredible. I said at the
beginning of last year and the
beginning of this year that she

Piwsjeannle Vecchio has overcome several injuries to enjoy success.

could be our top all-around
perfomter, and she has been,‘
Yohman said, adding that a
stronger vault will add to

Vecchio’s scores for next season. ‘

Vecchio has set lofty goals for
both herself and her teammates.
She wants to break Pitt's records
for both all-around and bars and
wants Pitt to qualify for nationals
as a team next season

Lacrosse club falls to John Carroll despite Watters’ two goals

off in long run“

By Spencer Box-lsoﬂ
sugwmer

The Pitt Panther lacrosse club suffered
its fourth consecutive loss last weekend at
the hands of John Carroll University with
a score of 54.

According to Panther coach Gary Neft,
the keytothegamewasJohnCarroll’s
goalie, who turned back nearly 30 Panther
shots and stopped almost everything in
sight.

‘John Carroll’s goalie had played

Midfielder Ed Croot concurred. ‘John

exceptional goalie.‘

John Carroll got off to an early 3-0 lead,

illegal-stidr penalty and never trailing in

the game.

Pitt's Harper Watters narrowed the gap
to 3-1 before halftime when he beat John
Carroll’s defense and goalie and catapulted

the ball into the net.

Pitt continued to ride the comeback
trail, holding John Carroll scoreless in the
third period and tallying two goals of its
ownearlyin the final quarter, knottingthe
score at 3-3.

John Carroll, however, capitalized on
Pitt penalties from that point on and
outscored the Panthers in the remaining
minutes of the game.

'Iheorilytirnetheyscoredallgamewas

Pitt defememan Darrell Schrnitt credited
the Panthers’ loss to the team's problems
working the ball inside on John Carroll.

‘We had problerris getting shots off from
the crease,‘ Schrnitt said ‘You can't shoot,‘
from the outside on a good goalie and ‘ 
expect to win.‘

The game was not without Panther

Women’s track team

Pitt had ll individuals and two

Cham-pionships. while three also
qualified for the .\'C.—&A pro

relay team set new meet and
school records.

The Lady Panthers’ success in
the ECACZ foreshadows the
success the team hopes to achieve
in the championships in late May.

“We still have a few more to go.

Among those who qualiﬁed

Sounding

Coruixuedfrom page S -3
nasty rumor circulating that
Amphetamine Reptile was on its
way to Chapter ll. 1 hope it's
gotten its funds straightened out.
If not, the world of noise is losing
a prime breeding ground.)

Helmet has been described as
everything from ‘cataclysniic
geological events‘ to ‘ionic metal
noise,’ but it seems more feasible
that it can’t be categorized its
dense and mind boggling but

most of all disturbing because it
doesn’t fit into a tidy musical
niche.

Helrnet’s intensity erupts from
a lack of tradition. lt’s pure noise
without the cluttered mess of
conventional musical
components.

Backed by John Stanier
(drums), Henry Bogdan (bass)
and Peter Mengede (guitar), Page
Hamilton pummels the lyrics into
a frothy goo with his hysteric

yowl. That doesnt detract from
Strap it Ons overall dlstoned
power, but after all, this isn't a

Mitch Miller sing-along
dedication.
‘Rudef ‘Bad Moon‘ and

‘FBLAS all fall into the swirling
vortex of the indiscernible.
Keeping with its full-on assault,
Helmet throttles beyond the
cutting edge with Strap {£071. lf
1 had to run through brick walls,

I'd want this on my noggin.

band from San Francisco that
plays soothing, pretty yet
intelligent, iangly-wangly music.
On its last album, the band
balanced often silly, noisy songs
with screamed vocals against
droning, pretty songs. It was fun
to listen to, but sometimes it
sounded a little unfocused.
With Mr. Sperzcb, the band has
toned things down quite a bit,
and the results are very consistent.
Most songs are built around two
chord riffs with very little change
in them. Guitarist Lindsey
Thrasher never really gets too
loud. She does more to create
the backdrop with the bass and
drums for Patricia Rowland’s
vocals. Rowlandls voice is kind
of low in the mix, and that puts
more emphasis on the sound of
the whole group. It almost
conjures up thoughts of early
Rl-ZM albums where Michael
Stipe’s voice had the same effect.
But Vomit Launch isn’t as fluffy.
With the exception of its version

of Barbara Manning’s “Every '-

Pretty Girl," most ofthe songs on
Mr. Spencb don’t reach out and
grab your attention. The songs
are subtle, and it might even take
a few listenings to get into them.
But further listening is worth it. It
reveals how hypnotic and pretty
a simple groove can be when it's
done by the right people.

In a time when bands trying to
be poppy get lost in a sea of
iangly guitars and overproduction,
Vomit Launch stands apart for its
sound as much as its name.

Maestro Subgum and The
Whole

jiggle the Constable [SP

(Y oni-Yay!)

Maestro Subgum consists of
four singers, trumpet, trombone,
piano and drums. When the
band came to the Upstage Lounge
a few weeks ago, it blew this
writer away. The band members
looked like an assortment of jazz
and underground musicians, and
its sound was a blend of funk,
folk, cabaret and offbeat humor.
All this from a band whose
members have names like Bobby
Ray Wow Us and Red Ned, the
Flame Haired Messenger of Love.

This eight—song EP docsn’t
have the immediacy of its live
show. (Hey, what record does?)
But it's still a blast to listen to.

jenny the Magnifier (aka jenny
Magnus) sings about women's
politics a funky groove. On “Skit
Skit Skat,” she and Lefty Frizzlc
(Beau O’Reilly to his mother)
sound like street-corner hipsters.

'Face" is a folky sing-along
reminiscent of the way Camper
Van Beethoven used to take
ridiculous lyrics and make them
sound good: "Dog/Snovv/Face./‘
Annihilation  ’ My personal
favorite is "4 Steps,

Maestro Subgum really has
nothing to do with underground
music ofany kind. But it takes an
alternative approach to things
like theater groups and musicals
that people who like underground
music can. and should. be able to
get into.
