Students for Life hosted a
guest speaker at last night’s
meeting who described her
own organization as the “old—
est, largest grass—roots pro-life
organization in Pennsylvania.”

Helen Cindrich, executive
director for People Concerned
with Unborn Children, began
her presentation with statis-
tics on abortions in
Pennsylvania. She cited that
50,988 abortions were per-
formed in 1991, and out of
that number 32,865 were per-

16,476 were performed on
African-American women and
1,431 were performed on
Hispanic women.

Cindrich said these num-

genocide against minorities
and accused Margaret Sanger,
founder of Planned
Parenthood, of wanting to use
abortion as a means of purify-
ing the white race and breed-
ing “thoroughbreds.”

She said that PCUC’s goal is
to stop Planned Parenthood
from “selling abortions.”

‘Pittsburgh Stop’ owner Won't quit

By Jessica Georg
For The Pitt News

Charles Bonasorte, owner of
The Pittsburgh Stop, is seeking
retribution for the 17-day clo-

“ sure of his stand on the corner

of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard two years ago.

The university slapped
Bonasorte with a $21,000 law-
suit for using the 621-PITT
phone number on his vehicles.
This apparently led customers
to believe the vendor was
directly associated with Pitt,
which he is not.

The suit ended with
Bonasorte owing $5,000 to the
university, but that does not
settle the question of the 17-

Wednesday tbrongb Friday
recognized as Derby Days

day profit loss, Bonasorte said.

Bonaso_rte said that he has
since “spoken with and
briefed” Pitt’s senior vice chan-
cellor for business and finance,
Ben Tuchi, of his plans.

Bonasorte said that as a
result of the meetings he is
“very happy with the new
administration” and is‘ “excited
with the new attitudes and
policies.” '

He declined to say how
much the damages will amount
to. “If [the university] is fair, I
have all faith that we can work
out an out—of-court settlement.”

On the other hand, Tuchi
said hehas “no idea what
[Bonasorte’sl next steps are.”

“We have an obligation to

past and how to work on

treat [Bonasorte] as any other
businessman, and all university
units would react that way,”
Tuchi said.

Bonasorte said that in the
past he was not treated as
any other businessman. by
members of. the Licensing
Division at Pitt. One member,
that has since been dismissed,
physically assaulted Bonasorte
on one occasion. _

Mary Bonach, director of
Pitt’s Book Centers, refused
to comment on that incident.

The mutual agenda will now
concentrate on problems of the

them with an open door and
dialogue policy, Bonasorte
said.

Continuing a 70-year-old tradition,
Sigma Chi fraternity held its annual
Derby Days this past Wednesday through
Friday.

During the two—day event, a smaller
version of Greek Week, Sigma Chi spon-
sored events for Pitt’s 12 sororities.
Events included the Hunt for the Golden
Derby, Derby Days Darlings and a Greek
Olympiad between the sororities.

Each sorority raised money for the
charity of its choice. The sororities went
canning and sponsored a woman for
Derby Darlings. People gave money to
vote for the woman that they wanted to
be Derby Darling.

Sigma Chi President Joe Bowman said,
“I’m really excited that all of the sorori-
ties are participating this year. It’s the first

time all of then‘. have participated in a
long time. This is probably due to ‘the
fact that each sorority donates all of the
money they raise to the charity of their
choice.”

Sigma Chi raised money through auc-
tioning off 12 members of its fraternity
and through Sig-’n’-Dales.

Sig-’n’-Dales is Sigma Chi’s version of
Chippendale dancers. “It’s a humorous
look at Chippendales. No one is a profes-
sional. We’re trying to have fun. People
pay five bucks and have a good time,”
said Chris Meier, Sigma Chi Derby Days
chair.

Approximately $10,000 was raised for

the 13 charities during the event, Meier

said.
The sororities became very competitive
for the event. “They get really competi-

tive about something that’s good for the

At Sunday night’s meeting, the
Panhellenic Association heard a propos-
al by local representatives from the
United Cerebral Palsy Association to
make Casino Night an annual activity.
Last year it was a charity activity spon-
sored by Pitt Greeks to benefit local
people with cerebral palsy.

UCPA has tentatively set the date for
this year’s event for Friday, Dec. 4 and
asked that the Pitt Greeks make an
effort to attend. Several members
expressed support for the project.

“We want to change the outlook of
the Greek system from a party organi-
zation to an organization which
improves the community,” Panhel
member Christiana Hahnfeldt said. “I
think we can really improve the com-

Panbellenic Association
to sponsor Casino Nigbt

munity by supporting this event.”

According to Panhell President Lori
White, last year’s Casino Night was a
fund-raising success for UCPA, and all
Greek members who attended had fun.

“What-made last years Casino Night
such a success was total interaction
between Pitt students and the kids with
cerebral palsy,” White said. “They really
got to know the people they were help-
ing. Doing fundraisers is a lot more
rewarding when you see what you’re
raising money for.”

White asked that sorority presidents
and representatives inform their mem-
bers about this project.

Other issues discussed at the meeting
include:

-Finally, don’t let the process get the

overwhelmed and discouraged about

that happen — the Placement Service

Political empowerment begins with the right to vote

By Mike Laughlin
Staﬂ Writer '

Sophia Joppy, a Pitt senior, believed
so much in political empowerment
that she registered 1,200 student vot-
ers on behalf of Project Vote during

the summer and beginning of the fall _

semester.
Joppy, an African-American resident
assistant in Holland Hall, -worked

"along side 10 other volunteers who

registered a total of 3,200 students.

“I felt like I really wanted to do
something for the black community,”
Joppy said. 0

After finishing the Woodrow Wilson
Program in Public Policy and
International Affairs during the sum-
mer, a program for juniors planning to
attend graduate school in the subject,

hjoppy called the mayor’s office to

inquire about local political activities
in which she could participate. The
receptionist with whom Joppy spoke
gave her the number to Hill House, a
local community organization. The

Hill House then put her in touch with ,

Project Vote. .
Her job with Project Vote was to

“Public inattentiveness leads to

‘political autonomy,” she quoted from

James Van Langingham, a teaching fel-
low in Pitt's political science depart-
ment, who taught American Political
Process, a course Joppy took. Joppy
said that is what she would say to
people when they would walk away,

and that would make them come.

back.

She not only registered voters on
campus, but she also registered voters
at Kennywood during African Unity
Day and at the Harambee Festival at
Homewood. ‘

“I would have definitely made an

impact even if I had only registered.

one person,” Joppy said about
whether the numbers really meant
anything to her. .

Joppy said most of the people she
registered were very cooperative and
receptive to what she was doing,
although a few expressed frustration
with the political system and had to
be coaxed to register.

The voters she registered on campus

   

were evenly split between the
Republican and Democratic parties,

although most of the Republicans she .

spoke with said they plan to vote for
Bill Clinton.

Thomas Hanson, a resident assistant
in Tower A, was a big help to Joppy
in her voter registration activities.
Joppy said that Hanson went out with
her every day and helped her with the
paperwork afterwards. For every 100
people she registered, Joppy had two
hours of paperwork to complete, and
this was on top of her class work and
her RA duties.

“I could not have done itiwithout

' him,” Joppy said.

Project Vote is a nonpartisan, non-
profit voter registration organization,
said Jim Tarpley, a ﬁeld organizer for
Project Vote’s Pittsburgh office.

Tarpley explained that a Washington
attorney, Sanford Newman, saw the
need to reach out to low income,
inner—city residents and educate them
on the voter registration process and
the importance of voting. ’ Project
Vote started as a loose—knit organiza-
tion in 1980 and became fully incor-
porated as a nonprofit organization in
1982. It came to Pittsburgh in 1984

to vote.

Project Vote recruited its workers
through the Summer Youth Job
Program and registered a total of 14,_
578 voters in the Pittsburgh area from
June 1 to Oct. 5 of this year. Tarpley
said that the goal for Pittsburgh this
election year was to register 9,000 vot-
ers. _ '

“Uoppy] is a very focused young
lady,” Tarpley said.

Tarpley also commended Terry

Milani, a staff member with Studer.»'k,_.

Affairs, and Mary Lou Fosso, manage?
of the snack shop in the William Pitt
Union, for helping him set up tables
in the Towers’ lobby and the WPU.

“The students at Pitt were very
gung-ho about being registered, not
apathetic,” Tarpley said.

Next year’s mayoral -race will be
Project Vote’s next big registration
drive. Tarpley said his volunteers will
be back on the streets in February.
While he admits that Project Vote is
mostly active during. major political
races, he said he is hoping that the
organization will become a perma-
nent, year—1ong entity to get voters
registered.

The Radical Goals of the

“We must counter this,”
Cindrich said when she men-

that feminists feel it is better

Cindrich claimed that for

couples wait annually.

A pro—life publication called
Lifeline stated that half of all
abortions were repeats; of the
abortions in Pennsylvania,
around 20,000 have had one
prior abortion and that more
than 800 have had four or
more previous abortions.

Cindrich also spoke of the

Tennessee, in which a hus-
band and wife in the process
of a divorce are fighting over
custody of frozen embryos.
The husband wants to dis-
pose of the embryos and the
wife wants to keep them.

The judge referred to the
embryos as “children,” and
Cindrich said that this case is

A broken down Yugo

For almost a year now the world has watched and
waited while the former Yugoslavia self-destructs.
Millions of people have died and much of the coun-
try’s infrastructure is in shambles. And while the inter-
national community has acted (albeit slowly), with
winter approaching, it seems as if things are going to

~”3‘get much worse before they get any better. All this

despite the factthat the West has both the manpower
and know-how available to stop the atrocities.

The questions involved are immense. While the
world searches for answers, Serbia is bombing Bosnia.
and ethnic cleansing continues. Who would have ever
thought that “civilized Europe” would once again see
genocide?

We can hardly pretend that we have all of the_ .

answers. Yugoslavia has a deep history of ethnic tur-
moil and strife. The cultural factors alone make this a
difficult question to answer. Couple this with the
mountainous terrain of Bosnia—Herzegovina and one
can see the problems involved here. However despite
these problems, the same question comes to mind that
was asked when everything began —— can‘ the world
wait any longer. The people of Serbia, of Bosnia-
Herzegovina and of Croatia cannot. But we continue
to wait. Pragmatic explanations like the ones above no
longer hold any weight. The moral issues must be
addressed, and they must be addressed now.

The_ New Yorle Times advocated five ways that the
world can help slow down the slaughters. They advo-
cated the establishment of a prompt U.N. presence, a

no-ﬂy zone (similar to the one instituted in Iraq), a

K)’

A

repealing of the arms embargo, the speeding up of
relief supplies and the taking-in of refugees. However,
while all of these’ actions are necessary, they offer very
little in the way of solving the real problem involved.
Given a volatile history, the real answer will require a
type of physchological victory that will enable these
people to live together once again.

Yugoslavia could at one time proudly boast that their
brand of Communism worked. No longer. As
Communism has died in Eastern Europe so has
Yugoslavia with it. It always has been a country held
together by a string. ‘Despite all of its significance,

however, this is hardly about the death of an ideology. ,

It’s about the death of millions and millions of people. ‘

Western Europe has come to grips with its past. The
European Community has proved that keeping histori-
cal hatreds in check is the way to prosperity.
However, the forces of nationalism cannot be denied.
As one Serbian student once wrote, “If the West can-
not learn to deal with this problem and make conces-
sions regarding their interests in the former
Yugoslavia, it is hard to expect that they will be ready
to make them within the community.”

lGore-y details from a conservative

A strange thing happened the
other day. Dan Quayle did not
collapse under the huff and
puff of the good senator Al
Gore. In fact, he did not even
ﬂinch. He did not cry or suck
his thumb when Mr. Gore
attempted to humiliate him on
national television. Nor did he
drop his note cards or fumble
with his tie. He did not babble
idly or mumble into the micro-
phone. In fact, Dan Quayle
stood comfortably at the podi-
um, spoke in a natural, relaxed,
tone and was even so outra-
geous as to imply that Mother
Earth’s good friend, Mr. Gore,
could possibly be wrong.

Chicken Little, on the other
hand, looked’ like someone we
would expect to find on the
shelf next to Barbie at the toy
store. Quayle outright ignored
Gore’s juvenile attempt to por-
tray him as Satan simply
because he did not agree that a
pregnant woman should be
exempt from murder laws. Mr.
Little, although he acknowl-
edged Quayle’s several correct
accusations as a “laundry list,”
did not (or perhaps could not)
refute even one ‘item.

Poor Al. Here he was,
expected to kick butt on
national television as if he were
debating Pee Wee Herman.
Quayle was not supposed to
even have a chance. Instead,
Chicken made statements as
idiotic as “there are too many
abortions in America” right
after proclaiming his deep com-
mitment to “a woman’s choice.”
If abortion is nothing more
than “a woman.’s choice,”
Senator, how could there be
too many? Does Al have some-
thing against women? Is there a
point at which a woman has
used up all of her ‘‘choices?’’ ,

Someone should tell these

~ women that they have a_right
"to choose only as many times

as Al Gorethinks is okay. If
they’re not really babies any-
how, who cares how many we
abort? On_ pages 32 and 33 of
Earth in Balance, Al condemns

the “startling surge in human
population” with a dramatic
exponential graph. If we can
reduce the population without
killing babies (we only kill
fetuses), why set a limit? How
can we possibly have “too
many abortions?” This contra-
diction does not concern

.Senator Gore, but, among other

things, it did concern the
nation. Despite what the New
Yellow Times had to say about

Matt
Carter

the debate, many who watched
it were surprised at Gore’s
incompetence. His own pro-
fessed supporters went out of
their way to call CNN and
express their letdown in “Tip-
per Barbie’s” plastic husband.

All of this made me feel sorry
forAl Gore. I really (almost)
did. I felt so sorry that the next
day I went with a few friends
of mine to greet Mr. Gore as he
visited Pittsburgh. While we
waited for his arrival (he was
one—and-a—half hours late), sev-
eral femz’-nazis scowled and
hissed at our.Bush/Quayle
apparel. ,

The tie-dyed people were
especially amusing. They were
the typical “angry youth” —
wearing scratchy wool socks
and sweaters and nibbling on
granola.

Apparently we were “little
rich kids” because we weren’t
voting for a tax-and-spend
Democrat whose tax increases
alone totaled 18 percent of
Arkansas’ annual budget (a
state whose spending has dou-
bled since 1983). Meanwhile,
the.ignorant masses held up
“We love Tipper” signs. Little
did they understand that Tipper
wants to censor the tapes they
-were listening to in their
Walkmans (unless of course
these people with nose rings
were listening to Beethoven -
but somehow I doubt it).

What surprised me the most,

however, were the old people.
I had always assumed that most
radical activists grew out of it
by mid-life —— once they, too,
had achieved success. This was
not at all the case, as I soon
discovered. A little old man in
a suit chased me around the
square, jumping and grabbing
at my Bush/Quaylesign like it
was Medicaid. He was so
annoying that I finally looked
at himand said, “Sir, you are
very immature.” I guess that
scared him some because he
quickly ran away, although I
think that I had outwaited his
attention span anyhow.
Another old man looked at
me and said, “The youth are
ignorant.” Perhaps that is why
most of us vote for Democrats,
sir. Unfortunately, Senator Gore
finally arrived and spoiled all
the fun. We professed our sup-
port for the dear senator by
waving several Bush/Quayle

signs at him as he spoke. When _

we held up a picture of an
aborted fetus (not a baby, mind

you), the crowd grew angry."

“That’s disgusting,” some left-
over from the ‘60s cried. “Take

it down!” Yes it is, sir , so cut it ,

out.

The party ended when a few
of us ran up to Senator Gore
after his speech waving our
signs. It was great. You could
feel the tension in the air.
Security guards removed some
of us from the area, but one of
my friends was able to shake
Al Gore’s hand and proclaim
his paramount support by
blurting out, “Quayle kicked
your ass!” On my way out,
some wide-eyed sandal freak
ran up and asked me how
much I was getting paid by
Bush to waste my day hanging
out with people like him
(although he didn’t quite word
it like that). “I’m doing it for
free,” I replied, “because I love
my country.” Someone yelled
back that I’d love it more if
Clinton were my president.
“No, sir,” I said. “I love my

country now.”

Students ask if
Finkin is T hinkin’

In a recent piece (issue 10/15) Nat
Finkin asserts: “Rape isn’t a crime against
women.” Rather, he says, it is a crime
against nature and society involving a
“psychotic need to dominate and control.”

However, women are raped. And the
rape of a woman is a crime against that
woman.

To claim that rape is not a crime against
women is effectively to removethe
women who have been raped from view
— to make them substitutable for anything
in nature (e.g., a rainforest) or society,
merely another object of a psychotic
episode. A

We need not agree on how to character-
ize rape theoretically to realize that women
who have been raped are women, and

‘ women are people and people deserve
our attention — especially when an act of
violence has been committed against them.

One further note: I take the slogan
which prompted Mr. Finkin’s piece, “Dead
men don’t rape,” not to be a mandate to
kill all men —— that would indeed be
absurd -——- but to be a warning that only
men who are not able to rape are dead
ones. That is a call to all men to think
carefully about how they act in the sexual
aspects of their relationships. The myth
that a woman means ‘yes’ when she says
‘no’ is just that — amyth.

Letters

Nat Finkin, an open-rninded individual,
and his roommate, who eloquently
demonstrates his receptivity in his com-
ment, “I hate feminazis! I hate @#$%&‘
feminists!” attempt to simplify the subject
of rape. _

Mr. Finkin,your ignorant attitude toward
women is exactly what is being targeted
by these slogans. No wonder you reacted
so violently — “... finding the persons 
and breaking their legs off at the knees.”
Interesting solution!

Personally, I cannot understand what is
so offensive in a slogan that states “Stop
Raping.” I didn’t realize that rape was a
privilege given to men. When I read “Dead

‘Men Don’t Rape” what is brought to mind
is women who have not beenable to ge
justice through our legal system. '
I Nat Finkin believes that rape is “not a
crime against women,” but rather a “crime
against nature and society.” This is [not]
much consolation to a‘ rape victim. He also
states that “rape is not about the degrada-
tion of a woman.” Frankly, I can’t think of
anything more degrading than having your
safety and body violated. ‘ I
think Mr. Finkin is misguided when he
states that researchers believe that “all sex
is an act of violence perpetrated against
women.” Any victim of rape could tell you
the difference between a consented sexual
act and sex that is violent, angry and
forced. It is difficult to believe that anyone
has such a prehistoric notion of rape.

Bring out your heavy artillery and
let’s talk about racism from a new
perspective. Not the perspective of
“Whatever racism is, it needs to be
eliminated,” but the perspective of
“What exactly is racism, and what,
if anything, can be done about it?” I
would like to argue that racism is
highly a two—way street riddled
with double standards and an atti-
tude that the only solution is an
accusatoryposition. I would also
like to convince you that racism is,
unfortunately, not going to go
away.

In our history racism has always

played a role in the politics, feel—-

ings and lives of people. After the
Watts riots, Martin Luther King and
the assassination of Malcom X
e~Americans believed that they opp-
ressed minorities of our country
had been dealt an unfair hand. "And
they had. i

Today in America, the number of
Americans who believe minorities
need more government help has
dwindled. '

There are a number of folks who
see the current situation as hope-
less. Inner—city crime is increasing
daily, as are welfare lines and
prison overcrowding —— all this
despite the fact that government
intervention has substantially
increased.

Even from The Washington Post,
the media left, we can find omi-
nous statistics: Of all black males
in Washington D.C. between the
ages of 18 and 55, 51 percent are in
jail, have been in jail or are on
parole.‘

Another‘ example: While I

 adamantly oppose any form of gun
a control that takes guns away from

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday October 20, 1992

Why racism in this country is here to stay

honest citizens, I have decided
once and for all never to join the
NRA after seeing its recent ad cam-
paign. It utilized the LA. riots as a
selling point for its mission.

The NRA states in its ads that
while honest citizens sat in fear
weaponless criminals, specifically
blacks and Koreans, ruled the
streets with their illegally-acquired
weapons. Running amok looting
and killing with illegally-obtained
weapons is wrong, but attempting
to increase the membership in your

Chris Diersen

organization by breeding fear of
blacks and Koreans is intolerable.

So what am I getting at? This —
When average Americans see in
their magazines and newspapers an
already negative image of minori-
ties, racist feelings are reinforced —
whether or not what they read is
true.

When a white man tells you he

hates people like Spike Lee, is that‘

any different than Spike Lee claim-
ing white people are responsible
for all of black America’s woes? No,
it is the same hatred. Does that
make the white man racist? Yes, it
does. Does that make Spike’ Lee
racist? Yes, it is the same racism.

When a white man or woman’s
image of job quotas is that of an
underqualified black man, thumb-
ing his nose at him or her through
the glass of their old office win-
dow, quotas aren’t working.

When a black man or woman’s

image of job quotas is that _of a

white government’s token handout

to their social group, job quotas 3.

aren’t working. Job quotas don’t
work and they never will. Why?
Because their goal to eliminate one
aspect of racism has failed. And it
has failed because of racism on
both sides of the spectrum.

There are presently many more
situations which highlight our fail-
ure to conquer racism. What is the
solution? There is none. So long as
we continue to take the approach
to racism that we are taking todaxz/‘M
racism will only grow. '

When a person who is racist sees

a protest against racism, a demon- I

stration or a march, do you honest-
ly believe that s/he will be cured of
racist views? Please. If anything,
that person’s opinions will be rein-
forced. If one believes he or she is
right, change is difficult. Pro-testers
and militants need to realize that
theyare preaching to the already
converted. '

To put a dent in racism people
must realize that they are headed
down a dead end road with their
current tactics.

Individuals should be the focus.

The individuals who are racist are ‘

going to have to be convinced that,
quite simply, they are wrong. Not
even the slightest amount of shout-
ing and protesting will educate
people of their mistaken beliefs -
which most likely were developed
during childhood.

Eliminating racism is a difficult
task. Some would say it is impossi-
ble.

Spike Lee sending out a false message

Not too long ago Spike Lee told
African Americans to skip school or
work and go see the premiere of
his new movie Malcolm X, but the
world cannot stop for the day to
see his film, no matter how educa-
tional it is.

Would Charles Drew or Martin
Luther King have told African
Americans to skip school? Regard-
less of its cultural implications, a
movie on Malcolm X is not algebra
or grammar. Education is more
than daily course work. It teaches
responsibility by establishing a rou-
tine. Lee is educating people, I will
concede that point. But encourag-
ing children to skip school for his
movie does not promote education
— it promotes irresponsibility. ~

Other movies provide the same
education that Lee talks about.
j.F.K. shed some light on the
killing of a national hero. Lean on
Me took a closer look at failing
educational systems in cities. And
Gbandi taught us about a man
whose non-violent teachings liber-
ated an entire country.

All were important films which
supplemented our schooling and
provided cultural education. Yet
none of these movies brought
about a call for a mass exodus
from daily society. Why?

Because children shouldn’t skip
school. Especially when the movie
will still be there Friday night,
Saturday night and so forth. Why is

it so critical for Lee that the public

views it on Friday afternoon in
place of school or work? Because
Lee had a different motive in mind

when he said people should take
the day off to see his film. His
point was political — not educa-
tional.

If children took the day off for
his movie, then they would want
the day off for other educational
movies — school becomes sec-
ondary. A precedent is established.
Education happens outside the
classroom — granted.

But who is to keep school

  Aliso

I1'W1Il

absences from occurring through-

out the year? In many depressed

areas where there is much uncer-
tainty in life, school provides a sta-
ble atmosphere.

Politically, Lee wanted people
involved in a passive demonstra-

tion telling America that people are

concerned about the African-
American fight. He also wanted to
tell lawmakers that the public is
tired of passive laws. He wants the
public to request action — regard-
less of the cost.

But the cost is to the wrong peo-
ple — children. How can they suc-
ceed when a role model tells them
an attitude or idea is more impor-
tant than their basic education?
Young adults need their education
to make their ideas work. Without
them, their ideas are immobile.

The action that is needed, how-
ever, transcends petty politics. I lis-
ten to my friends who are African
American speak of the hardships in

social life, not about their political
difficulties.

How we are treated in the world
has a greater impact on us than
what we get out of the world.
Being followed by a police officer,
for fear that one will shoplift,
has more of an impact than most
laws.

Perhaps Lee is trying to addresm,
these same issues in his statement.
to see his movie. Racial tension
has escalated to such a degree
that action needs to be taken —
and more than just simple legisla-
tion. The riots in L.A. prove this
point.

There are a lot of things that can
be done to change the world, but
the most practical and effective
method is to be concerned with
your own actions and take respon-
sibility.

Avoid stereotypes and presuppo-
sitions about other people and
races. The hatred needs to be bro-
ken down, and experiencing the
lies
start it.

Pitt men ’s tennis disposes of Duquesne 6-3

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

In the final regular match of the
season, Pitt men’s tennis team defeat-
ed the Duquesne Dukes 6-3 yesterday
to improve its overall record to 3-0-1.

With two remaining tournaments
before the winter break, the Panthers
go into the Duquesne and Rolex
Invitationals on a collective high.

“We’ve beaten Duquesne, I’d say
the last eight years,” Pitt head coach
George Dieffenbach said. “This match
was very close. I give Duquesne a lot
of credit, they were strong opponents
and played some very competitive
matches but my guys just rose to the

Replacements lead Panther football

PHILADELPHIA Pa -
When, the Panther offense
lost two of its best weapons
in three weeks, head coach
Paul Hackett either had to
find the answers or defeat
would find him.

This Saturday at Veterans
Stadium, Hackett foun‘d
Raymond Belvin and Lyron
Brooks, and their perfor—_
mances helped to hide Pitt
from defeat.

“... We needed
guys,” Hackett said.

“When you’ve got Chris
Bouyer, who is leading the
conference [with six catches
per game], standing on the
sidelines,” he said, “it really
means other people have to
step to the front.”

Belvin stepped up to
play tight end this year
after being bounced back
and forth between line-
backer and tight end during
his red—shirt season last
year.

The loss of starting tight
end Rob Coons to a broken
hand three weeks ago had
Hackett looking Belvin’s

those

occasion and came through. We won
four out of six singles and two out of
three doubles. We took advantage of
momentum when we needed to and
performed well as a team.”

Surprisingly, the two singles losses
came in the top two seeds as No. 1
Alex Cobbold fell to Vince Riveroll
and No. 2 Eric Weaver fell to Eddie
Leal 6-2, 6-4.

The lone win for Pitt among the top
three seeds came from Junior Scott
Smith, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Scott
Huff. Smith’s steady play has
anchored the team in the first half of
the season.

“I knew [Huff] was bad,” Smith said.
“I knew how to play him. I knew he

 

was quick so I wouldn’t try to make
him move. He missed a lot and I had
my serve. I think I had seven aces
today. His serve was off, and I could
tell that his backhand was weak. I’d
try to pick on his backhand and then
come in on him.” _

The bottom half of the line-up was
steady as usual, losing more than
three games in a set only once. Junior
James Chronister defeated Mike
Sullivan 6-3, 6-4. Senior Effrum
Garnett rolled past Steve Banno 6-1,
6-1, and senior Jeff Campbell beat
Carlos Weigering 6-2, 6-2.

In doubles play the tandem of
Cobbold and Smith defeated Godreau
and Leal 7-6, 2-6, 7-6. Garnett and

past Temple

Kelly Casey/The Pitt News
Tight end Raymond Belvin caught seven passes for 93 yards last Saturday against Temple at
Veterans Stadium.

Campbell overcame Banno and
Weigereing to capture the second of
the two doubles victories. The only
loss in the doubles came from Weaver
and Chronister, who were defeated by
Riveroll and Sullivan by the score of
4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Last Friday Pitt drew with the Akron
Zips, providing the only blemish in an
otherwise perfect record. Due to rain
the match had to be moved indoors.
The competition was halted in the
doubles round with Akron leading 4-
3.

“It started raining so we had to go
in the bubble- [the indoor facility] to
finish it, but unfortunately we ran out

way.
What he saw impressed
him — seven catches for

93 yards and perhaps the
tool Hackett needs to run
the tight end oriented
offense.

“If we ever would have
thought of [playing Belvin]
three weeks ago when Rob

Raymond would come in
and do this kind of a thing
—— What can you say?”
Hackett said.

“He’s catching the ball
with people draped all over
him. I never, ever would
have thought that.”

Quite a performance for a

find a niche on the Panthers
a year ago.

A position that has not
found a niche in Hackett’s
offense this season is the
fullback.-In what was one of
the most wide-open posi-

tions on the team at the

start of the season, no one

for himself.

Pitt hockey club slashes UP] 14-3 in opener

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt Hockey Club opened its
1992—’93 West Penn College Hockey
Association (WPCHA) season on
Sunday with a 14-3 thumping of Pitt-
Johnstown at the Golden Mile Ice
Center.

The Panthers schooled their branch
campus adversaries as they completely
dominated the game both offensively
and defensively. ,

Centerman Bill Crousey led the
Panther attack with an incredible

eight-point (4 goals, 4 assists) effort.
Other high scorers were RW Scott
Kalson with four points (3 goals, 1
assist) and Dave Kovan, who had
three points with the third Panther hat
trick.

Panther goaltender Dan Bratkovick
was rarely tested in this contest, as the
frustrating Panther defense held the
Mountain Cats to just 12 shots
throughout the game. UPJ netminder
Shannon Ravie was peppered with 56
shots.

It was UP] that shot out of the gate
first. Midway through the first period,

the Cats scored two unassisted goals
just 18 seconds apart. Panther give-
aways in their own zone set up both
scores.

Pitt started its comeback with 31 sec-
onds left in the first period on a goal
by Kovan, who was assisted by Vic
Disantis. This sparked an unbelievable
streak of 11 unanswered goals by the
Panthers that lasted well into the third
period.

Crousey scored his first goal of the
night one minute and 20 seconds into
the second period, tying the game on

Life goes on for sports fans after Pirate playoff loss

They surely must like
Pittsburgh. How else can we
explain their annual pilgrim-
age" to this town?

Every year for the ‘past
three seasons, Pittsburgh
has become the “in” place
to visit if you are a traveling
phantom of sports doom.
Can you feel them? Can you
sense them? They’re in the
air around you. Lord knows
the Pirates surely do.

_In what has to go down in
baseball history as one of
the most nerve-wracking,
gut-wrenching games of all

our hearts — again. Three

times they have attempted
to scale the National League
Champion Series mountain.
Three times they have
plunged off.its face.
Clearly, the month of
October has not been good
to the _city of Pittsburgh.
Yet, as I sat there amidst
the numbness watching the
aftermath of “the nightmare”
(thank you Stan Belinda), I
found myself looking at
things a little differently
than in years past. I found
myself looking at not just a
baseball game, but at the
concept of sports in our
society as a whole and how

it affects our daily existence.

I found myself questioning
just why it is that we, this
masochistic species known
as the typicalus americanus

Chris
Weber

sports fanus, continue to
torture ourselves by living
and dying with our favorite
sports teams. As a result, I
have come to the only con-

clusion that can be made -
Without sports, there is no
life. _

I can vividly recall watch-
ing my favorite team, the
Philadelphia 76ers, lose to
the Los Angeles Lakers in
six games in the 1981-82
NBA Finals when I was 13
years old. I remember

—watching the bedlam that

broke out in the Fabulous
Forum as fans ran out on
the court to celebrate the
Lakers’ victory.

What I also remember,
however, was the temporary
loss of sanity I experienced
when out of nowhere I

began to curse out Jesus
Christ for making the Sixers
lose. I did this openly in
front of my mother, who,
needless to say, wasn’t
thrilled at my display of
angen

I went to confession the
next day.

Since that experience, I
still find myself getting just
as upset over the losses suf-
fered by my favorite teams,
but I have also learned that
in spite of the anger, the

rage and the frustration I ”

may feel, sports games go
on. Life goes on.

Hockey

Continued from page 9
a setup by Kalson and Kip
Liuse.
Crousey gave Pitt the lead
just seven seconds later,

when he stole the puck in:

the UPJ zone and flipped a
shot past Ravie. Then, 22
seconds after a pretty goal
by Kalson that gave Pitt a 4-
2 lead, Crousey took a pass
at the blue line and did his
best Mario Lemieux imita-
tion — cutting through the
defense then turning Ravie
in knots before burying his
third goal of the night. He
was not even halfway fin-
ished.

Crousey tallied his fourth
point of the game when he
and Liuse assisted on
defenseman Phil Lavy’s goal
at 9:31 of the second peri-
od. The final shot was fired
in Pitt’s second period scor-
ing assault when Kalson
knocked in the rebound of
Crousey’s shot for his sec-
ond goal of the game at
14:47.

Upon entering the third
period, Crousey and the
Panthers picked up right
where they left off.

After killing off a minute-
long, two—man advantage for
UPJ early in the period,
Crousey stormed into the
Johnstown zone shorthand-
ed, cut across the crease
and notched his fourth goal
(5:25, unassisted) to give

  

 

Pitt an 8-2 lead.

Two players were ejected
and the game was nearly
called after a melee at 7:45
of the period. This brief
lapse, however, did not

slow Kalson, who complet- t

ed his hat trick at nine min-
utes to give the Panthers a
9-2 lead

After two more Panther
goals by Kovan (9:36, unas-
sisted) and Steve Fisher
[11:42 (Stock, White)], UPJ
finally got back on the
board with a goal from Jim
Hickernell (12:24, unassist-
ed) to make it 11-3.

The Panthers added insult
to injury with three more
goals. Liuse [13:45 (Crousey,
Lavy)], Kovan [14:27
(Anderson)] and
[14:45 (Mahoney)] scored to
finish to bring Pitt the 14-3
margin of Victory and a 1-0
record in the WPCHA.

“We got off to a slow
start, but controlled the
tempo after we got our first

- goal,” hockey club President

Mike Mahoney said, who
assisted on Pitt’s final goal.
“Our defense gave them
[UPJ] very few chances,
and we made the most
of our opportunities. Our
next game will be a lot
tougher.”

That game is a 10:30 p.m.
start at Golden Mile against
Army (Ft. Bragg, N.C.) this
Friday.

In the ancient Mayan civilization, mem-

Can you imagine rooting for the
Pirates and having Tim Wakefield or Jim
Leyland put to death because they were
members of the losing team? Or Mario or
Jaromir axed because the Pens failed to
repeat?

Thankfully, our society is a bit more
civilized. Teams are not put to death or
out of existence. There is always next
year. Sports spring eternal. While this
may not seem fathomable right now,

thing to be thankful for.

It is the beauty of our country that
we have constant year-round sports.

After all, without sports what else is
there?

There are those who claim that sports
are grossly overemphasized in this coun-
try. They may be right. After all, how
else can you explain a society that will
pay basketball player Magic Johnson
$14.6 million for one season (and not
even a full season at that), while only
paying a school teacher barely enough to
pay rent?

Finances aside, however, there is noth-
ing wrong with the emphasis of sports in
our society. To be a sports fan in
America, and particularly in Pittsburgh, is
to experience life. To feel the exhilara-
tion of watching the Pens win two in a
row and go for three is fantastic. To feel
the despair of seeing the Pirates lose
three years in a row may not be pleasur-
able, but it is feeling and emotions that

takes a lot of pride in know-
ing what he has to do.
When Lex [Perkins] leaves I
hope Dorsett will perform
every week. With his speed
and intelligence we should
have a pretty good free
safety for the next three

years.”
Dorsett decided to bring
those abilities to Pitt

because of -his family ties in
the Pittsburgh area.

“I was highly recruited out
of high school,” Dorsett

_ said.

“I had a wide variety of
schools to choose from. At
first I really did not lean too
much to Pitt, but I always

had a love for Pitt. When

I was younger I was always
around the university.
My main reason for coming
to Pitt is to be closer to
my family, who reside
in Aliquippa [Pa.]. My family
is my number one motiva-
tion.”

Dorsett Jr. received some

very solid advice from his

father before coming to play
football for the University of
Pittsburgh. V

“My dad told me to go to
school and make good
grades,” Dorsett said.

“He told me not to worry
about making ‘me or your
mother proud of you,
because we will always
be proud of you. You

have to make
happy first and then every-
thing else will fall into
place.”’

Dorsett said that he is
pleased with‘ his play so far
this year with the Panthers.

“I am playing pretty well,”
Dorsett said.

“I am surprised about how
much I'm playing. I feel as
though I adapted to the PT
[playing time], and I just
want to continue to do a
good job.”

Dorsett gives a lot of cred-
it for the job he is doing to
Rapone.

“Everyone should have a
coach like him,” Dorsett
said.

“He treats you like a man,
and he has taught me so
much about playing the
.defensive back position at
this level. He is the teacher
and you are the pupil.
There is a great amount of
respect that goes on

' between Coach Rapone and
he is‘

the player that
instructing.”

Dorsett said he thinks the
instruction could allow him
to play cornerback for the
Panthers.

“I think I would be able to
be a good cornerback at this
level,” Dorsett said. “Next
year I will start at free safe-
ty, but if I had it my way I
definitely would like to start
at one of the corners.”

“You have to win five

So while we all mourn the

Even if the Bucs fail

The Steelers are in good

So Hackett looked to his
pack of first-year fullbacks
not expecting much. What
he got was a pleasant sur-
prise —— Lyron Brooks.

Brooks, whose season
looked to be washed out
as a prime redshirt candi-
date at the start of the
season, rushed for only
13 yards on five carries

against

October 20, 1992

Temple last
Saturday.

But it was his two touch-
downs that brought him into
the spotlight and suggested
to Hackett that, if he stays
healthy, he could be the
fullback of the future.

“What can you say about
Lyron Brooks?” Hackett
asked. .

“What a marvelous foot-

a lot of that credit to Carl
Hagins. He has taken Lyron
under his wing all year
long.”

Hagins’ friendly tutoring
may have cost him the start-
ing fullback slot. C

Like all of Pitt’s fullbacks,
Hagins has been used spar-
ingly as a ball-carrier, even
in short-yardage, touchdown
situations.

The fact

that Brooks

touched the ball four times
in one game (and got the
call to score the two touch-
downs) hints that if he rep-
resents the future at full-
back, that future may be
now.

“I said it last week. We
are at the midway point. We
don’t have freshmen any-
more,” Hackett said.

“We have guys that have
to step to the front. Lyron

The improving play of

Groch

Continued from page 3
which focused on movies from the 19405 and
‘S05; Martin Scorcese and Steven Speilberg; and
American values, which he described as a “lazy

Susan of intellectual studies.”

Two years ago, Groch began teaching at Pitt
as a one—year Visiting professor. He is now in his

ﬁfth semester.

Groch pursued his undergraduate studies at
Brown University in Providence, R.I., and his
graduate work at the University of Iowa. He
studied American Studies, an interdisciplinary

work concerning literature, history, film and
popular American culture.

His all-time favorite movie changes weekly.
This week it is the 1954 version of A Star Is

Born, starring Judy Garland. He listens to a wide

range of music, including jazz, pop and reggae
and reads mysteries and contemporary fiction.

Groch also avidly follows politics, which is an

inﬂuence of his grandfather who worked for
Chicago’s Democratic machine.

“I’m one of those geeks that watches those
Sunday morning news shows,” Groch said.

Senate

Continued from page 3
ments with the educational
committee. .

At the policy committee
meeting on Oct. 13, the
Graduate and Professional
Student Association presented
a survey conducted by its
office that showed teaching
assistants were working more
than the 20 required hours
and that there was a critical
lack of office space and office
support.

Steve Parks, president of
GPSA, said he has been told
by other TAs that they have
been inﬂuenced to underre-
port their workloads. This
anecdotal evidence was part
of the reason the subcommit-
tee was formed, he said.

The subcommittee will hold
a forum for graduate students
to voice their concerns and
opinions. The main thrust of
the subcommittee will be to

G C C t C C C

coordinate fact-finding.

Parks said that he thinks
the subcommittee is a good
idea. _

“There aren’t people in the
departments abusing ,TAs,”
Parks said. “The fault is with-
in the system itself. I have
heard stories from some TAs
that have to work very long
hours grading papers and so
forth. This negatively affects
their own studies.”

A GPSA newsletter on the
report charges that “faculty
and staff compel students to
misrepresent their workloads
on official activity reports.”

This report contradicts a
survey done by the-policy
committee, which showed
there ‘were few cases of
TAs/TFs working more than
20 hours, and there were
also several cases of TAs/TFs
working less than the 20-hour
standard. Sharon Nelson-Le

Gall, co—chair of the policy
committee said that the sub-
committee. will have represen-
tatives from the GPSA, stu-
dent representatives from
CGS and CAS and faculty
members from FAS. She, said
that the survey from the
GPSA is valuable as a source
of information for the Senate
Educational Policy
Committee.

Parks said that they GPSA is
mainly concerned with the
workloads of graduate stu-
dents.

“The contracts we sign
don’t specifically spell out
what we’re supposed to do.
We need multi-year contracts
that have a system of raises
for rewards for good work.
The department policies can
change on an arbitrary basis,
and we’d like to be able to
have them standardized,”
Parks said.
