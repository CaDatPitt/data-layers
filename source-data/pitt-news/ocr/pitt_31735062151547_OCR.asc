“Hay Fever”
Roles Filled

Cass Enthusiastic Over
Player Production

 

 

Tryouts held last week for the
Noel Coward comedy, “Hay Fever,”
Pitt Players’ vehicular choice for
their ﬁnal production of the year,
resulted in four of the leading parts
being deﬁnitely ﬁlled by Director
Carl B. Cass.

Those named by Director Cass

this week included Florence Bow-
man, Col. ’34, as Judith Bliss;
Douglas Lewis, Col. ’32, as David
Bliss; Jean Stotler, Col. ’33, as

’35, as Simon Bliss. -

Director -Cass is enthusiastic
over the forthcoming play, claiming
it has exceptional qualities for
amateur production. He said:
“ ‘Hay Fever” is ‘unique in that
practically every character in the
cast has a leading role. The lines
are very evenly distributed through-
out the three acts, thus giving
each member of the cast the same
chance for prominence.”

Written in the same satirical
manner as Coward’s “Private
Lives,” more widely known come-
dy, “Hay Fever” concerns itself
with the peculiar antics. of a sophis-

vidual members of which pride
themselves on their unconvention-
ality. The four players named,
above comprise the Bliss family,
and although not the only “leads”
in the play, were the-first to be se-
lected by Director Cass.

“Hay Fever” will be presented
sometime during the ﬂrst two
weeks of May, probably in the
auditorium of Taylor Allderdice
High school. The complete cast
will be announced next week, Cass
said, and rehearsals will get under
way immediately following.

Dr. Eddy spoke to large‘ audi-
ences at the University of Wash-
ington at Seattle upon his return
from the East recently and met
with tremendous approval. H. L.
Seamans, executive secretary of
the University of Washington Y.
M. C. A. in a letter to the local

Dates Named

New Departure Marks
Future Assemblies A

 

Two coming tapping assemblies
were announced by Franklyn Yel-
lig, Mines ’32, chairman of the as-
semblies. committee of Student
Council, at its meeting Tuesday.
This procedure will be a marked
departure from the previous meth-
od of holding all tapping-in a joint

tion of Anna Kovach, Ed. ’32, and!

meeting. It is felt that the differ-
ent types of honorary organizations
can best express their particular
aims, and concentrate upon their
special activities, by this type of
tapping assembly.

These assemblies, the dates of
which were announced‘ at the
Council meeting Tuesday, will be
honorary, scholastic, and activities.
The scholastic tapping will bccur
April 29, in the Banquet room of
Memorial Hall, and the tapping for
activities will take place on the
lawn near Thaw Hall May 6.

No organization will inform
those to be tapped previously to
the assembly, it was announced.
The names of the tappees will be
printed in a pamphlet, and an-
nounced at the appointed time. All
honorary activities organizations
will join in the single celebration.
A noted speaker will be procured
to speak at the event.

The pharmaceutical, legal, den-
tal, and medicalhonorary scholas-
tic fraternities have been invited
to participate in the aﬁair with the
campus honorary groups. A speak-
er will likewise be secured for this
program, and will be announced
later.

Three members will be appoint-
ed to the committees of these pro-
grams from those enrolled in the
fraternities, Yellig announced.

Typhoid fever fatalities in Pitts-

death per 74 population in 1879 to
a mere handful of deaths in 1931
through the improvement in Pitts-
burgh’s water puriﬁcation methods,
Dr. Chester S. Drake, superintend-
ent of the Pittsburgh ﬁltration
plant at Aspinwall, told Dr. Ralph
8. Boots’ municipal government and
administration class last Friday.

Dr. Drake traced the history of
Pittsburgh's pumping stations,
reservoirs, and ﬁltration plants
from Pittsburgh’s incorporation as
a city in 1814.

Pittsburgh water was once so
turbid and murky, Dr. Drake added,
that householders had difficulty in
ﬁnding their soap.

* Scout Says:

A Intercollegiate boxing closed its ﬁrst full season in this district’
rathbrauspiciously last week when the Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing

Conference held its ﬁrst annual tournament at the Carnegie Tech gym.
For a new sport, boxing was rather well patronized; but several inci-

 dents occurred during the season which left much to be desired.

;, A The decisions at several matches were the main bone of contention.
In the "Pitt-West Virginia inaugural duel, the Schricker-Latham bout
which was awarded to the former ﬁghter caused much comment in

local newspapers as did the d

' .. ,_O’Toole, and Siegal-Olson ﬁght

ions in the Namlik-Eshelman, Siegel-

 

Decisions in Pittsburgh were not asbad as those at many
of the schools which have been sponsosing‘ the sport for a long
time. it was practically impossible at some of the latter places
to win a ﬁght without knocking out the local boxer. The
Moran-Croissant bout was an example, and even then many
who saw the ﬁght contend that Croissant in reality did" knock

out his opponent.

The main reasons for the poor decisions were the ignor- :
ance of the referees of the intercollegiate rules and the employ-

‘ment of the “r_lght" referee.

‘, from the collegiate code.

The referees in most cases spe-
cialized in officiating at amateur bouts and rendered their deci-
sions according to the A. A. U. rules which differ somewhat

 

‘Twenty points are the highest possible number a collegiate boxer
can earn-in a round. Fourteen of these go for offense and defense,

four for generalship,

and two for aggressiveness.

In amateur circles, the man who wins a round or holds his oppon-

q ‘ out even in that session receives ﬁve points. A man who loses a round

not conspicuous in Pittsburgh.

Pitt employed a different referee for each of its fights, and Car-
negie Tech engaged Simon Carlson for the intercollegiate Con-
ference tournament despite the fact that many Tartan follow-
ers thought that he had robbed Carnegie in his decision in the

-  gslegel-O'Toole duel.

The schools in ‘the Eastern

intercollegiate Boxing Associa-

tion were those most guilty of employing referees who favored

the home team quite noticeably. inasmuch as this body is the
g. pioneer in the sport, it willhave ,_to remedy»:-theseconclitions if

the sport isgto maintain and increaseits popularity.

 

The discontent with decisions was plainly evident at the‘Confer-
ence championships where two judges were appointed to render de-

cisions along with the referee.
three men, Moore of Duquesne,

If the referee had been the sole judge,
Schricker of Pitt, and Demedowitz of

Washington and Jefferson, who won the championships in their’divi-
alone, would have lost their bouts on the ﬁrst night of the tournament.
‘Vitulla of Duquesne who was runnerup in the 115 pound division would
not have been a ﬁnalist for the same reason.

Inasmuch as a close decision counts as much in the team scoring

as a knockout victory,

the schools must ﬁnd a more satisfactory means
V. of arriving at decisions or change the point system and award a man

who wins his bout by a knockout more than the
. gman receives for a. decision victory.

Other arsmnerits.aro.se over the men picked to fighl_:.in the
tournament and the switching of men who had fought at one
weight throughout the season to another weight for the tourna-

ment.

5 The officials, however, can be pardoned somewhat for these
difficulties as the records of the different men were not always
comparable and the system of selecting the semi-finalists was ~
the best possible under existing conditions. :

 

The best possible_way to get around these difficulties would be
the addition of the requirement that the coaches submit the entire
seaso.n’s record of their men along with their ranklngon the squad.
This would include the results of each ﬁght and the weight class in
which the bouts were held. This would give officials an opportunity to
compare the men even if the schools did not meet for the results of
their ﬁghtswith. other opponents might indicate their ranking. Such
.a system would have altered the tournament contestants in the 125
pound division where Namlik and Conti of Pitt and Fisher of West
Virginia, three of the four best in the Conference, were left out while
Morrissey of W. & J. and Vernacinni of Duquesne, both of whom are
admittedly below the level of the above three and the latter of whom
was kayoed by Fisher, were given places in the event.

Such a.. system would..also,._have -prevented, a school from ranking

* its men in divisions different from those in which they fought during

the regular season such as West Virginia did when it ranked Hamilton
as a 135 pounder and Neely as the 145 pounder when they had fought
in the reverse classes in all of West Virginia’s dual meets.

 

Booing is another factor that is quite apparent at collegiate
matches. Fans, however, can rest assured that when a crowd

When a man wins by a wide

I There was no doubt that Francis Siegel of -Pitt had a clear
cdge over Sammy Meil of Temple in their semi-final bout at

the tournament.

Even Lester Biederman .admitted it. When

‘ the decision was awarded the Philly boxer, no one booed.
Yet the decisions in the Scricker-Kutcher and Burley-Beloff
ﬁghts, which were much closer, were booed. if the crowd does

not expect a certain decision,

it is not prepared to boo it.

When it ﬁgures that the local boy is to lose a close one, every-

body is prepared to boo.

That's the reason

why the Siegei-

Spring Drills

Complete First Week of
Practice

For about a week now the\sprlng
football sdliad has been ‘grinding
away up at the Trees practice
field. The sqiiad is working hard,
taking off excess weight, and learn-
ing the basic elements of the game.

Sutherland left yesterday. morn-
ing to speak at the University of
Buffalo “B" banquet, held last night
in Buffalo. The banquet is to hou-
or all the lettermen of that college
during the current year.

Stress Fundamentals.

So far the coaches have had lit-
tle time to do anything else but
emphasize the simplest fundament-
als. The line coaches take their
men and show them how best to
hold their hands and how to squat
to get the most drive in their legs;
the ball carriers .are shown the
best way to start off with the ball.

The squad which reported for
practice so exceeded all expecta-
tions that several of the men may
be divided into teams named after
the opponents in next year's sched-
ule. This-, is a, departure from any
previous year because the coaches
always had to wait for the next
freshman team to come up before
they could do this. Possibly this
fact may give the staff a‘ jump on
Other years. and they certainly
needit.

The schedule this year is with-
out a doubt the most difficult
which any Pitt football team has
undertaken. Starting off with Ohio
Northern (the only setup in the
schedule) Pitt must tackle iWest»
Virginia, Duquesne, Tech, Army,
Notre Dame, Nebraska, Ohio State,
Penn and Penn State. This is the
first time Pitt has taken on aten
game schedule. -

Opponents ‘Strong.

Every team in this array is well
known for the good games it turns
in. Immediately west of the Alle-
ghenies there is no team harder
than Carnegie Tech and Duquesne,
barring Pitt, of course. Then go
out into the Middle West and ﬁnd
a harder team to tackle than Notre
Dame. The same holds good for
Nebraska, westof the Mississippi.
And the crushing defeat adminis-
tered last Year by the passing
Panthers will do nothing to render
Nebraska any sweeter in temper.
In the east, Army is admittedly
the most consistently strong team,
and Major Sasse will be looking
f0!‘ revenge when he stacks up
against Pitt at the Yankee Stadi-
um. Furthermore, Ohio State is
always represented by a good,

‘of entry blanks.

agers of teams in the intra-

Pitt Sponsors
School Meet

High school Mermen In
Annual Tournament

 

On April 1 and 2. the University
of Pittsburgh will sponsor . its
eighteenth Interscholastic Swim-

ming Championship meet. In
the past, ‘the Pitt champion-
ships have drawn the cream

of the high school swimming teams
in the tri-state district, and from
the present list of teams iilready
received '- for this year's « meet, ‘none
of the precedent of the past will
be lost.

The strong -Vincent ‘High team
of Erie, which won last year's
meet, is to be found among the list
From present in-
dications, the team from Erie is
bringing an aggregation of tank
stars who are expected to annex
the cup for the second consecutive
year. Carrick High of Pittsburgh,
which took the runnerup berth last
year. is _also, among the list of con-
testants. The local team, which is
the ﬁnest in city high school com-
petition, is expected to make a de-
termined bid for the team trophy.

In addition, Academy High of Erie, '

Canton Mc-Kinley, Akron East of
Ohio, and practically every Pitts-
burgh Scholastic team will com-
pete in the championships.

Preliminary heats will be held
Friday evening, while ‘the cham-
plons will be crowned Saturday
afternoon. In addition to the
medals to be given the individuals
winning a ﬂrst, second, or third
in each event, a trophy will be
awarded the team scoring the
greatest number of points.

On the same afternoon that the

event.

Rillemen Conclude

Successful Season

 

The Pitt riﬂe team concluded a
very successful season last week
at the regional tournament in Cin-
clnnati. The local boys did not
come up to expectations in the
tournament due partly to the
strange riﬂe range. ,

Cincinnati U. came out on top
with the score of 1363. Dayton U.
placed second and Carnegie Tech
third. Pitt followed in fourth
place with the score of 1321, a
very low score in comparison to
their showings in the telegraphic
meets during the scheduled sea.-
son. -5 The locals were leading the
ﬁeld up until the last position,
standing, was ﬁred; in this posi-
tion they fell very low, thus being
forced into fourth place.

Lose Only Two.

During the past year the Pitt

boys shot with consistency, their

scores ranging between 1371 and
1420. Only two meets were lost
and these were very 01039» T119
Cornell meet ended in a tie at
1400 all, but the meet was awarded
to Cornell due to their better score
in the standing position. Stanford
was forced to shoot 1421, the high-
est score of the season, to beat
Pitt’s 1420. Some of the strongest
teams in the country were met and
defeated by the Pitt boys, bringing
Pitt a wide reputation ‘in the-riﬂe
sport. One of the high spots of
the season was the defeat of the
crack Army team by the Panthers.
Wilson individual Star.
The most consistent individual

star of the season was Wilson, fol-
lowed closely by Wuertenberger.
The highest individual score was
281 shot by Wilson.

Next week the Pitt team will
enter the Hearst Annual Cup Tour-
ney, and they are expected to come I
out close to the top in this post
season match. This is probably
the most celebrated riﬂe match in
the country.

cinnati meet are as follows:

Boxers Compile Good

  First Season Record

For a team that was ﬁghting its
first season of varsity collegiate-
boxing, the Pitt team has abso-
lutely nothing to be ashamed of in
the matter of its record.

Practically all of the boxers

were fighting for their first year,
and none of those who fought as
regulars had any previous experi-
ence, with the exception of Harry
Conti. .
Coach Orsini had to face one of
the hardest schedules of any box-
ing coach, and the fact that it was
Pitt’s first try at regular competi-
tion did not tend to draw large
crowds of enthusiastic students.
However, with the material _on.
hand,‘ Orsini gradually ‘built upa
squad that proved good enough to
down West Virginia, Carnegie
Tech, and hold Army to a draw.
Penn State, Syracuse, Temple, and

West Virginia won over the
Panthers, but not by any great mar-
gins.

The team was further handi-
capped by the lack of a boxer in
the 175 pound class for the entire
season, and the lack of a 115
pounder for the ﬂrst part of the
season. The match with Temple
was lost when Pitt had to forfeit
in the 175 pound class. Altogether,
"the Panthers lost ﬁve bouts by
forfeit during the entire season.

Lose Three Veterans.

When the call for candidates
comes next season, Rubbo, Nam-
lick, and Martin will be among the
missing.

Rubbo was one of the most valu-
able men on the Pitt team. His
peculiar style .of slowly shuffling
around the ring surprised many an
unwary opponent who later had
to be assisted to his corner. Rubbo
carried a punch in each hand, with
the right usually being the more
effective. He furnished one of the
biggest surprises of the season in
the Tech match when he fought
Pouncey, in the 155 pound class.

heavier than his usual opponents,
and although sick, Rubbo managed
to win by a knockout.

Joe Namlick. another miracle .de-
velopment of this year’s team, was
never regarded as varsity material
until the last few weeks of the
campai n. Namlick substituted
for Conti when the latter was hurt,
and ended up with a record of two
victories and one defeat.

Henry Martin never quite re-
ceived the credit he deserved in
the two years he fought for Pitt.
Last year Martin fought at 145
pounds, and reduced his weight
this year to be able to compete at
135 pounds. Martin entered the
ring at the Tech match to ﬁght a
man 10 pounds heavier than him-
self, and although he put up a
great ﬁght, dropped a close de-
cision. _

Material Coming Up.

The material remaining for next

year makes the outlook not as

“‘side'ratio‘n. I

In the 115 pound class, McCarrell
will likely ﬁght his second year for
Pitt, unless some of the up-and-
coming frosh should displace him.

Unless Harry Conti's arm is in
good shape next season, Coach
Orsini will have to look around
for some one to take the place of
the absent Namlick.

Both Schempf and Santicola will
remain in the 135 pound class with
the possibility that one or the
other may be shifted to the 145
pound class to take the place of
Rubbo.

Jack Schricker, who came away
from the first Eastern Intercolle-
giate Boxing Conference with the
155 pound title, should hold down
the position in that weight.
Schricker has been putting on
weight lately, and it may be more
advisable to place him in the 165
pound class instead of weakening
him by making him come down to
the weight required for the 155
pound class.

Schricker May Shift.

In the event that Schricker does
ﬁght at 165 pound class, Francis
(Duke, Cowboy, Jabbo) Seigal may
be shifted to the next higher berth,
the 175 pound class. Seigel proved
to be the surprise of local colle-
giate boxing pircles by his per-
formances. Only a decision that
everyone thought should have
never been given prevented him
from competing in the ﬁnals of
the 165 pound" class in the Confer-
ence title bouts.

The coming freshman boxing
tournament may bring to light
some hidden talent. As time goes
on, the schedules of the various
teams usually become harder, and
if this proves to be the case with
the boxers, Coach Orsini will have
the best excuse in the world for
becoming prematurely grey.

W. A. A. is planning for an In-

by the organization. '
Those features making up the

During Vacation 4 

 

 

If dry weather is in order oval‘
the Easter vacation, the track team
will move to the Stadium and final-
ly begin training there. Only
those boys who wish to practice
during the free period will be ex-
pected to train, while those who
live out of Pittsburgh will be und‘e1j_- . - ” 
no obligation to practice. 

If the spikers are ﬁnally able to
move to the Stadium from 
trackhouse, it will be nearly 
weeks after the shift had beeli‘
scheduled. Coach Shea. had hoped’
to move his boys about March 13*  i
or 14, but the cold weather, and

w_,

killed his ‘plans.

Shea is beginning to feel 
his men need all the outdoor prac-
tice they can gather. The track’
house does not meet the needs of T ' ...»:»

Furthermore the Ohio State meet-
here on April 23 is beginning to _
draw uncomfortably near. The
Buckeyes are always represented
by powerful teams and this year -
should see no exception. Among
the members of the team which
comes here will be Jack Keller, .
one of the greatest hurdlers in the ,
country, and an almost sure 0lym- ’ , 
pic team member. ' -

The Pitt shorter distance men.
such as :Milligan, Mousheim, Harris. 1::
and Keller, are anxious to set into
the open where they can race on 9.

speed, and the other members of
the team are in the same mood. '

Final results of the eastern meet
will be sent to Wisconsin on com-

Well! Well! Well!

 

F ONE, DETACHED entirely from the campus, were to climb to
a vantage point and look down upon that group of students who
take their college activities so seriously, what a good time he would

be having these days.

o

The recent squabbles in Student Council which broke out
over_proposed changes in the electoral system were undoubtedly

conducted

in the fullest measure of sincerity,

but they were

scarcely calculated to assume the proportions to which they ha-V8

since grown.
The issue is clear enough.

A standardized system of campus

voting is needed here at the University. It is obviously unfair for
any one group of students to enjoy advantages which are not
accorded to other divisions of the student body.

 O I O Q

C O I C

INCE THE DEFEAT of the proposed measures in council meet-

ings, the political pot has been boiling.

Cliques ﬂit about

 ensconced in their own importance; Council members are pressed to
find answers for their recent action; drastic petitions are drawn up
and signed promiscuously, and Dental Student Council has even
-taken itself so seriously as to pass a formal resolution that appears
.tb be ihegproduct of adelightful naiveness. Of course, a vote of
'. .censure,,j§_gaihst, alleged misrepresentation of facts in publication of
the the _recent' council meetings was expected and that,’too, is just

what has happened.

And now what started out a clear,

logical cooperative study

 developed into an issue about which nobody has any deﬁnite
ideas but feels compelled to suggest a surplus of hazy notions.
it is another case of giving the proverbial mole-hill the proportions

of a mountain.

Political scientists will probably sit back in their chairs and

chuckle at the ways of the college student.

They may even think

that this is all very goodtraining in the intricacies of political

' life. But unless something is done soon, an agreement reached that

will make for just student elections, we suggest that the student

representatives confess their inadequacy to cope with the situa-
tion and place it in the hands of the administration.

What a good laugh this whole idea of student government is,

NNOUNCEMENT THAT the

Civic Club of Allegheny County

‘would again sponsor the opening performafice of the Cap and
F Gown show directs attention to the fact that the city has recog-

nized the rapid strides made by

the Pitt theatrical group, an ad-

,vancement which has placed it among the first seven college pro-
ducing organizations in the country.

0 To be sponsored for three consecutive years by such a ﬁrmly

established organization as the Civic Club is a compliment to the

men responsible for the staging of the shows.

Special signiﬁcance

will be attached to the opening performance of “The Silver Dom-

This Morning

 

Butterbach, Bracken to Argue Against Eight Schools
- For Government Legislation to Provide for
Centralization in Control of Industry

2*??-

William Butterbach, Col. '33, and
John P. Bracken, Col. '34, leave
for Dayton, Ohio, this morning at
10:45, on the ﬁrst lap of the south-

ern‘ trip of the Mens' Debat-
ing Association. Richard Mur-
phy, assistant coach of debat-

mg, will not leave with the de-
baters but will meet them in Day-
ton tomorrow in time for the de-
'bate at 2 o'clock with the Univer-
sity of Dayton.

The debaters will argue the
aﬂirmative side of the question,

“Resolved: that Congress should
enact legislation providing for the

"centralized control of industry,” in

eight debates against southern
schools. They will return home
Sunday, April 3. All traveling will
be by bus.

From Dayton, where Butterbach
and‘Bracken will clash with a team
that has just returned from an ex-
tensive. western trip, the team will
travel to Knoxville, Tenn., for a
meeting with the University of
Tennessee, the next day. 3

The University of the South, or
Sewanee, at Sewanee, Teun., will

he the next stop for the debaters,

   

Easter Sunday will be sp‘ent in
Chattanooga, Tenn. The debaters
and their coach will visit the
civil war battleﬁelds and enjoy the
colorful southern Easter with no
debates scheduled for /that day.

Monday, March 28, Butterbach
and Bracken will debate the team
of Emory University at Atlanta,
Ga. Emory is the alma mater of
Bobby Jones, golf star, and is re-
puted to be exceptionally strong in
forensics.

Three debates ﬁll the Pitt card
in N. C. Johnson C. Smith Univer-
sity, at Charlotte, will afford com-
petition for the team on Tuesday

Club in Pittsburgh last week. The
team of Wake Forest College, at
Wake Forest; N. C., will be met on
Thursday, March 31.

One more debate, with Washing-
ton and Lee at Lexingto Va.,
March 1, will complete the ched-
ule. The debating Panthers will
spend Saturday, March 2, in Wash-
ington, D. C., with no debates
carded. and will arrive back in

Examinations Seen Here
As Necessary To
Education

Examinations are essential to the
orderly conduct of an educational
system. They serve both the stu-
dent and the school.

In the first place, we ﬂnd many
students who have the ability to
do superior work but require en-
couragement and stimulation to
prod them on. In deciding be-
tween a dance -and his psychology
the following day, the chances that
the psychology will win out are
greatly increased.

We all know men and women
who never tire of reproaching their
parents for not “making them

, .‘study” when they were. ypung.

They realize now that as youths
they placed too much emphasis up-
on temporary pleasures. If with
the dark shadow of examinations
forever hovering over them, stu-
dents neglect their work, what
would they do if examinations were
removed?
From the point of view of the
university_ examinations are essen-
tial in determining advancement.
It would be foolish for a student
who consistently received low
grades in. elementary
examinations to enroll in advanced
courses in that subject. And it
would be just as asinine ‘for a stu-
dent who failed or barely passed
his chemistry and biology examina-
tion to be permitted to continue
with his preparation for medicine.
The real defect is not to be found
in the theory or purpose of exam-
inations, but in the type of exam-
ination given. In my opinion an
examination should reveal the stu-

dent's ability to organize material.

on his subject. To this end, the
student should be allowed to use
all the books, notes, and other ref-
erences he would desire. With the

dent who had not consistently
studied during the semester could
organize his material which the
time allowed. Such an examination
would effectively serve the purpose
mentioned above.

The examination-, as given today,
is not given to measure the stu-
dent’s ability to organize his ma-
terial, but to discover whether_ or
not he has read the assignments
thoroughly. The fallacy lies in the

fact that much of the material as-.

signed should not be read thorough-
ly and it is an attribute on the part
of the -student to differentiate be-
tween that which should be careful-
ly read and that which should not.
In other words the examination is
very often a policeman’s mace rath-
er than a helpful aid in determining
the student's grasp of the subject.
It is these defects in the type of ex-
amination given and not the exam-
ination system itself which should
be remedied.

That Exams Create
False Standards

Examinations strike at the very
heart of education. They serve to
erect false standards and to divert
the students’ efforts, from mental
development to the mechanical and
temporary retention of isolated
facts. '

It is true that examinations, es-
pecially in the‘ larger classes, are
practically essential to the deter-
mination, of grades, but what good
are grades? They, too, center the
students’ attention upon false aims.
After all, the real test of whether
or not a college course is worth-
while, is the questien, “Has the stu-
dent grown? 'Hav.e his attitu-
des changed?” If the answer is in
the negative, the tudent has failed,
regardless of the number of facts
that he can repeat and regardless
of whether he has received as his,
grade an A or an F. Since examin-

ations must necessarily emphasize
bald facts, and since examinations
play a major role in the determina-
tion of grades, and since
grades can be procured with little
or no. actual mental development,
I believe that examinations are fu-
tile.

A student who is really in search
of knowledge and not grades, does

not need examinations to prod him‘

on. The student who is in college
merely because it is “the thing to
do,” on the other hand, is not stim-
ulated by examinations; he merely
crams sufficiently to get passing
grades and the following day has
forgotten most of the material.

I can think of no better indica-
tion of the stress of fatual knowl-
edge, to the detriment of real men-
tal growth, than the results of ques-
tionnaires submitted -to a group of
political science graduate students
in an eastern university. It was’
found that in spite of their lengthy
training in the theory of govern-
ment, nearly all of these students
still clung to the tenets of the po-
liticalparties to which their fathers
belonged.

In other words, although these
students could no doubt'recit'e’ the‘
history of the caucus and could ‘dif-
ferentiate between the procedures
of Republican and Democratic pres-
idential conventions, they still
could not consider disinterestedly
and in the light of their advanced
knowledge, principles which had
met with their families’ approval
throughout their lives. This is not-
education, and since examinations
are in a great measure responsible
for this condition, I .ﬁrmly believe
that we should rid ourselvesof
them. ' .
