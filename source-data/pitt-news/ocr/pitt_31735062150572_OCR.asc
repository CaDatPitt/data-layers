Morgan Announces Cast

Volume 32 Number 52

   
  

For Cap-Gown Production

Specialty Parts
Still Unfilled;
Tryouts Today

Edwin Trembath, BA41, pres-
ident of the Undergraduate Cap
and Gown club, and Richard
Lambie, C42, were selected as
feminine and male romantic
leads for the 1941 Cap and Gown
show, “Head over Heels.”

Fourteen out of the 15 parts were
cast decisively at a meeting of the
Graduate Cap and Gown club pro-
duction committee with Director
Edward A. Morgan last Monday
evening.

Trembath, after three years with
minor speaking parts and chorus
and solo specialties, will play
Adrienne Butterﬁeld, a beautiful
young dancer. Lambie, who play-
ed the romantic lead in last year’s
show and who was in the 1933 Cap
and Gown show before dropping
out of school for several years, will
portray Johnny Higgins, a news-
paper reporter.

Also cast were Jerome Lieber,
BA41, as Phineas G. Butterﬁeld,
Adrienne’s father, a newspaper vil-
lian, and a hater of romances, and
Paul De Merit, C44, as Mrs. But-
terﬁeld, the perennial society ma-
tron. John Knoll, E42, will play the
part of the second Butterﬁeld
daughter, a brat.

Members of the Ballet Russe de
Castle Shannon, Cap and Gown’s
rival to Fantasia, will be coached
by Allen Gould, BA43, as Boris
Sergei Dmitri Ivanavitch Petrov-
sky. The ballet will include Ed-
ward Hufnagle, Ed42, as Connie
Ott.

Among the other newspaper
workers in the “Head over Heels”
cast will be Harold Mulligan, a
dramatic critic styled after two 10--

Pre-Meds to Dance
At Cadaver Caper

Remember that old song “It
Ain’t No Sin to Take off Your
Skin and Dance Around in Your
Bones?”

Well, we don’t guarantee you’ll
see that kind of a performance if
you go to the “Cadaver Caper,”
but publicity gags like “If your
gal won’t come, liver at home and
take another,” are, to say the least,
suggestive.

The semi-formal affair is sched-
uled for Friday evening from 9 to
1 o’clock at Hotel Webster Hall,
and features music by Barry Blue
and his orchestra, according to
Charles Smith, C42, chairman of
the dance. It's sponsored by Chi

pearances in the next two months,
the band will play in Johnstown,

addition to its performances in the
Pittsburgh vicinity.

The annual concert tour, in which
the band toured the entire state,
had to be cancelled, since spring
recess, the week of the tour, this
year coincides with Holy week. In-
stead of the full length tour, the
band will make a four-day trip
through Ligonier, Johnstown, and
on up through the central part of
the state. The trip is scheduled for
April 30, through May 2.

M en’ s Council Will Sponsor
Student-Faculty Hobby Show

Stamp collections, model trains,
arrowheads, and-woodworkings will
be a few of the many items on dis-
play at the Hobby show in the de-
partment of ﬁne arts the week of
March 17, announ-ces James W.
Bateman, E41, chairman.

Sponsored by Men’s council, the
show will exhibit the hobbies and
collections of various students and
faculty members, and those per-
sons, students and faculty mem-
bers, men or"women, who are in-
terested in having their own hob-
bies on display at the show are
asked to see Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant to the dean of men and ad-
viser to the council. All items on
display will be placed in locked
glass cases.

The purpose of the show, accord-
ing to Corley, is to provide an op-
portunity for faculty members and
students to ﬁnd a common point of
interest, namely hobbies. “If,” said
Mr. Corley, “a student would like to
know his economics professor a lit-
tle better, and the student didn’t
know how to converse brilliantly
on the subject of economics, it might
be a long while before they got to
know each other.

“Now suppose this student col-
lected stamps and found out that

his professor collected stamps also;

immediately they would be on a
common ground and could converse,
accordingly, with a greater and
more mutual understanding. The
Hobby show will provide an oppor-
tunity for just that. The students
will ﬁnd out what their professors
collect, and vice versa.”

The Hobby show will be on dis-
play one week, with the po:sibili-

cani-eral legislative body, and will
meet April 24 through 27.

Sam Rodgers, C41, chairman of
the Pitt delegation, urges all stu-
dents interested in government and
other social sciences to attend to-
day’s meeting. The group will set
up nine committees to prepare laws
for submission to the model legis-
lature meeting in Harrisburg.

Former Pitt News Copy Editor
Writes for, Runs Many Papers

. By PAUL F. LOIIMEYER

Neal X. Russo, C42, doesn’t sell
subscriptions to magazines, make
sausage, or do the hula dance, as
some Pitt students have done, but
he is putting himself through school
just as successfully.

Some of the positions Russo holds
down read like a list of neighbor-
hood newspapers, for he edits the
Oakland News, The Homewood-
Brushton News, writes a column for
the Farrell Press, his hometown
newspaper, and contributes to the
Sharon Daily-Herald.

Former editor of the Turtle Creek
Independent and the Italian Club
News, which he founded at the Uni-
versity, Russo had to give up his
position as copy editor on the Pitt
News because the work became a
triﬂe too much.

To prove that journalism is

something more than just a sideline
with him, Russo points out that
while in grade school he edited and
published his own neighborhood
paper.

When he reached high school, he
found that there was no newspaper
of which he could become editor,
so with full conﬁdence he published
one of his own. His idea caught on,
and by the time Russo was a senior,
his paper was accepted by most of
the students as the oﬁicial high
school organ.

Not to be outdone by a mere stu-
dent, the school authorities decided
to publish a newspaper of their
own.

Not to be outdone by a mere set
of school authorities, Russo worked
his way into the editorship of the
ofﬁcial school publication, and
edited both papers.

U. S. Navy Summons
Pavian, Reserve,

To Do Research

Henry C. Pavian, associate pro-
fessor of aeronautical engineering,
is the latest member of the faculty
to be called to the colors. He has
been a member of the volunteer
Navy reserve and was summoned to
do research work for the Navy.

Pavian has been active in aero-
nautical research since his gradu-
ation from high school in Boise,
Idaho, in 1923. He studied at Wash-
ington State college, Pennsylvania
State college, and received his de-
gree from the University of Cali-
fornia in the spring of 1928.

Doing graduate work at Stanford
university under the direction of A.
S. Niles and W. F. Durand, Pavian’s
expenses were paid by the Army
Air corps because he worked on
some propellor projects in the line
of his study.

Pavian came to Pittsburgh in the
latter part of August, 1929, to work
for the Pittsburgh Metal Aircraft
corporation and the following year
accepted his present position.

Since coming to Pitt he has done
extensive work for various aero-
nautical corporations.

A special banquet was held in his
honor by his associates last Thurs-
day evening at which time he was
presented with an overnight bag.

WSSF Campaign
Ends on Campus

Today marks the close of the
World Student Service fund drive
for contributions on campus. After
today any further contributions
should be submitted to 801 Cathe-
dial.

The drive has so far netted al-
most $1,000. Included in this are
some contributions by members of
the faculty.

':The students who have been
contacted have shown a willing
spirit, and the result has been well
worth the effort,” says Hulda Tully,
C41, campus chairman of the drive.

A chart of the world has been
erected on the ground floor to record
the contributions. Each block
which is ﬁlled out represents $25
worth of contributions.

Dean to Be First
Alumnus Named
As Headmaster

Answering a call from his
Alma Mater, Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the School of Busi-
ness Administration, will assume
the position of headmaster at
the Mercersburg academy July 1.

Dr. Tippetts, who has been a dean
at Pitt since 1935, will be the first
alumnus ever to become head of the
academy, ranked among the best
preparatory schools in the country.

“It is with great regret that I
leave the University,” declared Dr.
Tippetts. “I have made many
friends here, both among the stu-
dents and the faculty. It has been
a great pleasure to be associated
with the students in the School of
Business Administration.

Proud of University

“May I also take this opportunity
to thank all the members of the
faculty of the School of Business
Administration for the loyal and
faithful support they have given
me. Without their cooperation my
task would have been a much more
difiicult one.

“This is a great university and
I am very proud of having been
part of it for six years,” concluded
Dr. Tippetts as he expressed his re-
gret of departure and, thanking all
the students who have come to see
him. promised to come back and
visit the University.

Rufus H. Fitzgerald, provost, who
knew Dr. Tippetts when he was
professor of economics in the Uni-
versity of Iowa. stated.‘ “Dean Tip-
pets and I have served together in
two universities. At both institu-
tions he has been a favorite with
students. The University will miss
him.”

“University Loses”

Commenting on Dean Tippetts’
acceptance of a new position, Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman said, “Mer-
cersburg academy is in good luck
to get Dr. Tippetts. By his going,
the University loses a strong and
popular man.

“My feeling is one of regret and
also of pride that Mercersburg
academy should take its headmas-.
ter from our faculty.”

During the monthly Board of
Deans meeting, the following reso-.
lution was passed:

“Resolved, that the deans go on
record as extending to Dean Charles
S. Tippetts our very best wishes’
for success and happiness in his
new ﬁeld of activity as headmaster
of Mercersburg academy.”

Taught at Iowa

Valedictorian of his class in 1912,
Dean Tippetts will ‘succeed Dr.
Boyd Edwards, who will retire.

Dr. Tippetts was born in Glen
Fall, New York. Holding a Litt. B.
M. A. and Ph. D. degrees from
Princeton university, he taught
economics in Princeton, and served
as professor of economics at the
Universities of Iowa, Washington,
and Buffalo before coming to Pitt.

He served in the 304th Infantry
of the AEF as first lieutenant and;
after serving 16 months overseas,
became a captain. .

The Chancellor
Makes a Point

ALTHOUGH THE CHANCELLOR was not
as specific in his answer to the student govern-
ment question last Friday as some students
hoped he would be, Dr. Bowman nevertheless
promulgated an important standard for student
self government when he stated that every par-
ticipant shouldbe a “gentleman.”

Were this code of conduct assumed by every
man in Pitt student government agencies, there
would be little concern regarding the matter of
reorganization.

If members of SFA, MC, and CA recognize a
need for reorganization, and apparently they do,
they must pattern any change along those lines
which will in the end bring about improvement
in student relations and conditions. With this as
their objective in a reorganization program,
there will be little doubt as to their eligibility to
qualify as “gentlemen.”

Those student legislators—independent and
fraternity alike—who consider this problem sole-
ly from a tight, partisan viewpoint, however, will

find that Dr. Bowman’s statement can be inter-

preted as a sharp rebuke to them.

It is certainly not gentlemanly to foresake an
intelligent, constructive attitude toward reorgan-
ization for a narrow, selﬁsh one. It is not gentle-
manly to impede revision simply because your
particular activity has traditionally sponsored
certain activities. And it is certainly not gentle-
manly to brush off criticism of your organization
with the remark that such criticism is just a
stream of personal abuse directed against indi-
vidual officers and members.

We are anxiously awaiting the decision the
representatives of student government will have
to make. Whatever path they choose, actions
-this semester by SFA, MC, and CA members will
determine whether we have “gentlemen” in Pitt
‘student government.

Tippetts, of BizAd,
lleeds Homing Call

DEAN TIPPETTS, of the School of Business
Administration, leaves Pitt at the end of this
term. Behind him he leaves an almost unﬁllable
gap in the faculty.

Faced with the problem of injecting some
semblance of vitality into an otherwise prosaic
department of the university, Dean Tippetts
stepped into his job, eventually making of his
achievement a mark at which others might aim.

The intricacies of business have never made
for the romantic life, Dale Carnegie notwith-
standing. Dean Tippetts realized this. Never
did he attempt to glorify his task out of such
proportion that he ].ost sight of its primary func-
tion—the transmission of practical facts, pure
and simple communication of the data of the
ﬁeld.

Nor did he ever become so involved with the
burdensome weight of statistics as to lose all
perspective of the relationship of his ﬁeld to the
emotional world in which we live.

. In the classroom, he was Dr. Tippetts; in the
smoking-room, in the discussion group, he was
Charley, bluff, scholarly, above all genial.

Most important, he was a Pitt man, identiﬁed
with the very stones of the Cathedral.

There is, in the composition of these 42 stories,
more than steel and stone. Supporting the
structure, giving to it the warmth of ﬂesh and
blood, are those whom we choose to call Pitt
Men. Of these, Charles S. Tippetts is among the

Final veriﬁcation of two histori-
cal facts——that. there was deﬁnitely
a city~o'I' Troy and that its ﬁnal de-
struction took place in the year 1188
B.C.——was recently disclosed by Dr.
J otham Johnson, assistant professor
of clas.ics and archaeologist.

Had the ancient Greek poet
Homer, author of the world-famous
“Iliad” and “Odyssey,” written the
verse that Odysseus returned to
Ithaca on April 12, 1178 B.C., ten
years after the fall of Troy, these
two facts could have been veriﬁed
quite simply.

As it is, many years and much
labor have been spent in ﬁnding the
exact location and year for the fall
of Troy.

In summing up the history back
of the recent di coveries, Dr. John-
son noted that the identiﬁcation of
the mound which contained Homer’s
Troy was first made by Heinrich
Schliemann in 1870. He discovered
the ruins of seven destroyed and
buried primitive cities, lying one
above the other.

Previous Version Upset

O1’ these seven cities, the second,
next to the bottom, was found to
have been destroyed by ﬁre and
gave every evidence of a hostile in-
vasion. This, Schliemann decided,
suited the story of the sack of 'I‘roy
by Agamemnon and his Greek fel-
low warriors.

According to Dr. Johnson, it was
in 1332 that Carl W. Blegen, of the
University of Cincinnati, returned
to the mound for the first of seven
ﬁnal seasons of exploration. His
first discovery upset the previous
*.rersion immediately.

Blegen found that Troy VI had
been destroyed violently by the
force of an earthquake which had

Another division will deploy from
Hull up the Aire valley, to meet.
parachutists at Leeds, and thence
moving down upon Manchester.

The Third German army will
move up the Thames estuary——the
only move the Germans actually
advertised years ago—towards Lon-
don, skirting the point of the
strongest British concentration in
the North Downs and the Weald.

The heavy channel artillery of
the Germans will go into action
against the entire British fortiﬁca-
tion system on the channel at the
same time the air, sea, and land
actions get under way. Thus the
British will taste all the German
weapons at one time, for in the
past eight months they have never
felt more than one or two simul-
taneously.

0 The Fourth Army

The Fourth army will have the
hardest task of slipping over and
through the naval—air defenses west
of Southhampton and east of Ply-
mouth, making landings in the
Avon, Wey, and Test valleys, and
then moving north across the
heavily—mined Salisbury plain. The
objective will be to encircle South-
hampton and the coastal defenses
and meet the Third army at Lon-
don. However, the Fourth army,
moving down the Kennet river to
Reading and thence down the
Thames. will travel some 135 miles
while the Third army will travel
only 50 miles from Ramsgate to
London.

The German campaign will thus
be a series of fast-moving pincer
moves similar to the Polish, Nor-
wegian. and French campaigns.
lV[ost of the transportation will be
done by air; the ground units mov-
ing in armored car and tank units
against similar British units. The
soiderweb rail system up into Lon-
don and thence spreading out into
the Midlands may be a handy
weapon for the Nazis, since the
British will not destroy railroads in
fear of hindering their own forces.
For this same season the Germans
may use British airﬁelds and oil
‘supplies.

I Bedtime Tales

The British have a magniﬁcent
naval defense, some 4.000.000 troops
in the Home guard and the regular
army. an unknown number of tank
and armored car divisions; and not
more than 10.000 planes. If the
Germans can’t overcome these
forces the Invasion of the Americas
will soon be a stale bedtime story.

The irony of this whole business
is the United Press report last week
to the effect that American ship-
ments of war material to Britain in
January decreased 20 per cent in
relation to December shipments.
Hey! Where’s Leland Stowe?

shattered the houses and split the
walls and towers to their founda-
tions. This catastrophe had oc-
curred about 135O B.C. It was ne-
cessary, therefore, to look still fur-
ther for a city which would agree
with Homer’s description of the
sack of Troy.

The next level above Troy VI,
the lower part of what had been
called level VII, had been destroyed
by a widespread conﬂagration
which had swept the city from one
end to the other. Everywhere there
lay skeletons, broken pottery, and
signs of enemy violence. This
would agree perfectly with Homer
and with the consensus of Greek
historians who themselves calcu-
lated a date for the fall of Troy
early in the twelfth century.

Date Deﬁnitely Decided

Dr. Johnson pointed out that
after the ten year siege of Troy,
Odysseus, hero of the Odyssey, and
the other Greeks returned home.
The conquerors took various routes.
Ho:tile winds on Odysseus’s jour-
ney, the longest of all, carried his
ship to Africa and the western

Mediterranean. Finally after ten
years of wandering, he reached
home.

“So says Homer,” Dr. Johnson

added. “But Homer also mentimis
that as the hero stepped off the
ship onto his native island of
Ithaca, there was an eclipse of the
sun.”

The only eclipe visible from the
island of Ithaca for centuries be-
fore and after the possible date of
these events, according to a Ger-
man astronomer, Carl Schock_ who
made the calculation, took place on
April 12, 1178 B.C.

Dr. Johnson concluded, “We now
feel certain that Homer’s Troy is a
deﬁnite historical fact and also that
the city was conquered and de-
stroyed ten years before, in the
year 1188 B.C.”

Engineers may well be called the worst suckers in
the world. Usually at the age of fourteen, a youth,
inspired by the Westinghouse bridge and an “A” in
algebra, decides that he is to become an engineer.
Engineers are harmless men so that mom and pop
have no objections to junior’s ambition. At ﬁrst there
is some question as to whether junior means a locomo-
tive engineer or a civil engineer. It does not matter
which junior has in mind, however, because it is pos-

sible to make a living as either of these, especially as
the locomotive variety.

Traditionally, all engineers are supposed to swear
violently, be he-mannish, factual, and profound at all
times. With all this in mind it is quite a problem for
a boy of fourteen to live a normal life. By the time
this young man graduates high-school, he has made
an “A” in trigonometry and has decided to become an
electrical engineer.

0 Premature Pre-Entrance Decision

He has been advised against civil engineering be-
cause most Civils are working for the WPA. Electrical
research is less romantic than clinging to a cliff in
a thirty mile gale while holding a plumb-line in one’s
teeth; but no one wants to work for the WPA. By the
time the prospective engineer has graduated from
high-school, it is too late for him to decide on a voca-
tion other than engineering. For at least two years
this young man has been telling his friends that he was
going to be an engineer. Any radical deviation from
this course would cause people to think he was unde-
cided. And we can’t have that sort of thing!

When this pea-green freshman candidate comes to
register in the School of Engineering his fate is pretty
well decided. No one will tell him that his chances for
doing research work are about one in a hundred. Any
adviser who might suggest that our man should not
take engineering is certainly no credit to the depart-
ment. Why scare him by telling him that there are so
many electrical engineers that Westinghouse uses them
mostly as motor inspectors?

0 Ethics vs. Three Hundred Dollars

Then there is the question of ethics. No conscien-
tious adviser should turn away a check for three hun-
dred dollars at a time when most of the faculty is pray-
ing for a raise.

But, who cares why the engineers are in the school;
they are here, and that is what is important especially
to the engineers. So, for the sake of levity, this col-
umn will endeavor to avoid such controversial subjects
as might arouse the ire of those rugged ones who send
letters to the editor. As an engineer should, we will
specialize. Our specialty will be a presentation of those
issues which are of no consequence, and can be seen
only by us who look at things through a glint in either
eye.

Swing Things
By Al I. Cater

Have you ever heard of “I Dreamt I Dwelt in Mar-
ble Halls?” Well, things are different now. It’s now
called “I Dreamt I Dwelt in Harlem.”

This week Glenn Miller comes up with a recording
of the above which is deﬁnitely light and swingy—not
raucous in the least. Unimpressive at first, it soon
warms up to be just good and yet not exceptional.

On_ the reverse is “A Stone’s Throw From Heaven,”
a typical Miller ballad which means it’ll be a good
seller regardless of its real worth.

Artie Shaw has released “Dancing in the Dark”
played by the full orchestra. This should please the
Shaw fans. Backing “Dancing” is “Smoke Gets in
Your Eyes” as done by the Gramercy Five. Speaking
of the Gramercy group reminds us of a comment
Metronome made about the harpsichord. They re-
marked, “The harpsichord is novel, but so is glass in a
ham sandwich.”

We don’t agree with them, but we still think it’s
a good crack. “Smoke” is to date the best jive of the
Gramercy Five.

For the lovers of the rhumba, Enric Madriguera of-
fers, “Un, Dus, Tres, Un, Dos” which translated means
“One, two, three, one, two” which, in turn, doesn’t
exactly make sense. The music, however, does make
sense. It’s refreshing to hear Spanizh music played by
someone who really knows something about the stuff.
In short, it’s muy bien, or something. On the reverse
is a b;t of bolero rhythm called “Un Momento" which
means——oh, skip it!

Chatter

4/Lam I/Le gtkleléteed

by Bill McElwain

Sports Editor

 

Editor’s Note: The following is a letter from our truck writer, Ben
Foote, and deals with a matter that Mr. Foote believes needs airing.

Dear Mac:

Because I am a member of the track squad and also write for
the News, the fellows on the Pitt track team have asked me to put
a case of theirs before the Pitt athletic authorities and students for
review and judgment. They know that most of the students are
aware of the esteem in which the Pitt cindermen are held by East-
erners and Midwesterners. And these students know that if any
team has brought fame to the University of Pittsburgh in the last
ﬁve years, it has certainly been Carl Olson’s track squad. I don’t
think I need to list. the achievements: the winning of two ICAAAA
meets in the last four years, of nine Penn Relays championships in
that same period of time, or that an Olson-coached team hasn’t lost
an outdoor dual meet since 1937; those things have been public-
ized enough.

This year, despite a dual meet loss to Michigan in the \Vol-
verine ﬁeld house, the 1941 Pitt track squad compiled a greater
record indoors than any time in the history of Pitt track and ﬁeld.
Even in losing at Ann Arbor the Pitt thincl-ads won six individual
titles, and last week they ﬁnished in a second place tie with New
York If for the ICAAAA indoor title. Never had a Pitt team
placed better than fourth in this meet. before. Hap Stickel and Bill
Carter have ﬂashed the I?-lne and Gold colors brilliantly all year.
Del Anderson, Zeke Sterner, Dusty Rhoades and the rest of the
boys have all done great work.

This Saturday, the Pitt track team was scheduled to run in the
Central Intercollegiate championships at South Bend. Back in
1934, in Coach Olson second year here. a Pitt team last won this
title. Last‘ year the Panthers lost by only a few points. This year,
however, the squad is in much better shape than it was at the same
date last year. The CIC title seemed deﬁnitely headed for Pitts-
burgh, but Pitt athletic officials have decided to keep these poten-
tial champions at home.

It seems odd that a team in the University that has done so
much. to spread. goodwill and gain fame should be kept out of com-
petition this Saturday because there is no ﬁnancial return. Under
the athletic policy that administration ofﬁcials have been following,
efforts have been openly made to secure the respect of Big Ten
and Ivy league officials. Success in track and ﬁeld by any school
has never attracted a cry of professionalism or proselyting. It is
one of the few sports that Americans regard as truly amateur, and
pay money (outside of Pittsburgh) to see. And although there are
no Big Ten schools or Ivy league schools in this meet, it wouldn’t
hurt Pitt’s athletic prestige to win it.

The team wants to go badly enough, especially since last year’s
team missed the title bv such a narrow margin. Red Jessup and
Anderson have even offered to put fellows up in their homes in
South Bend. Carter and Stickel have threatened to drive to South
Bend. Under the circinnstauces, it does seem small to keep this
spirited bunch at liome, do11 ’t you think, Mac‘?

Your friend and associate,
BEN FOOTE.

°Young Man from J ohnstown’ Replies S‘
. Sports Editor Receives Plea for Rifle Club

Dear Bill:

We all enjoyed your It—Ain’t-
the — Heat—It’s-the-Stupidity De-
partment in the Feb. 26, Pitt News.
Remember? That’s the one where
you told about the young fellow

reason the young fellow from
J ohnstown was so hopped up about
a club for all and every gun bug
on the campus was that he had
just came from the Johnstown
Center where for the past six
years or more they have had just
such a club. Maybe the swell time
he had with that club was hangin’
with him and was giving him a
hankerin’ for some more of the
same. Mebbe you guessed, I’m the
young guy from J ohnstown.

But lets get back to nobody
knowin’ nuthin about the riﬂe club
here at school. Looky churn,
seems to me like ’stead of blowin
that sort of thing around you’d try
to keep it under cover and hang
your head a bit. Figger it out.
You and this spread you run a
mill fer is put here on purpose to
keep us payin’ students and others
informed on what takes place
around the grounds.

Ain’t no doubt you do a good
job. Plenty of readin’ available
on who was with who in the Tuck
Shops a day er two previous.
Football, basketball, swimmin’,
they’re all covered nicely in the
sports column and I like reading
about ’em but doggonit I also like
riﬂe shootin’ and would like to
read an article er two on how the
boys are doin’ with the Springﬁelds
and ten rings.

I know, you got to Write on what
most folks is interested in but you
bein’ a sports writer ought to
know how far even football would

and tried to organize a riﬂe team.
But you’re a little wrong there, it
was a riﬂe club we wanted.

You see, there’s a whale of a
lot of difference between a team
and a club. It’s easy, a club is
composed of anybody who wants
to join, a bunch of guys who have
joined forces in pursuing a hobby
which they all like and which
they all want to learn more about.
The more able members help the
tyros, everybody gets a crack at
showing what he can do and
everybody has a swell time. Get
that word hobby, it’s important.

In a club there’s always room
for a beginner and that’s where
the big difference between team
and club lies. The Riﬂe Team
sponsored by the Military Dept.
here at the University is strictly a
varsity affair and the varsity boys
are darn good shots. A beginner
wouldn’t have a chance of making
the team. The Military Dept.
gives riﬂe instruction but only to
students in that department.

We can’t blame them for that,
they have enough to do without
taking care of a gang of “rank
amachoors.” But where does this
leave the guys mentioned above?
You know, the club boys. The

In Final Drills

Titleholding Gradyites
Await ECSA F racas

Ben Grady is putting his boys
through their ﬁnal paces today be-
fore leaving for the Eastern Colle-
giate swimming association meet
Friday and Saturday at Rutgers.

For the past two weeks, intensive
work on the part of the Panther
swimmers has been responsible for
the improved “times" recorded in
the various specialties.

Joe Orloﬁ swims the 50-yard
sprint in 24.7. Gus Wilde is only
one-tenth of a second slower than
Orloﬂ’, swimming the 50 in 24.8. For
the 100—yard free style, Orloﬁ tap-
ers off at 56.2, Wilde at 56.8. Orloff
is top man in two other divisions.
He is clocked in the 220 at 2224.9
and in the 150-yard backstroke at
1250.2. Herb Cosgrove can swim
the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:33
and can understudy Orloff in the
220 at 2:25.

Eastern colleges scheduled to
compete in the tournament include
Western Reserve, Rutgers, NYU,
lvlanhattan, Lehigh, Lafayette,
Franklin and Marshall, Delaware,
CCNY, Carnegie Tech, and Brook-
lyn.

Jerry Levin of Rutgers, by far
the best swimmer in the Eastern
Collegiate circuit, is deﬁnitely the
reason his school is odds on favor-
ite to capture the championship.
Olsen and Millard of the same
squad have compiled impressive
records in competition this year.

Franklin and Marshall, rated as a
mediocre team earlier in the season,
has shown a surprising reversal of
form and is rated as a major threat
in the ECSA race. Price, Gager,
Kachel, Badoﬁ’, Macionis, and Ber-
ger are the outstanding Diplomat
swimmers.

With a squad that includes Dick
Ames, Joe Kaule, Cosgrove, Orloff,
Wilde, Al Samson, Bob Soles, Al
Fedor, and Marty Kramer, the Pitt
entry will be tough to beat.

be today if you boys hadn’t talked
it up in your sheets. I’d say that a
few good descriptive write-ups on
the general idea of competitive
riﬂe shooting would stir up enough
interest in the sport that even the
dean of men’s ofﬁce would know
that such a sport did exist in this
school.

Well, now I’ve spoke my piece,
and poorly too, I guess. But any-
way, lets hear a bit about the
Riﬂe Team every so often and if
you get any ideas about how a
club could be formed work on
them. I got a bunch myself and
have not yet entirely given up
hope of a club where we non-
expert, non-ROTC boys can go to
shoot for the fun of it.

Pitt Ski Club Loses Out

In Invitation For Hunt

The Pitt Ski club, recently grant-
ed its charter by the University,
was represented by William Johns,
E43, and H. Lincoff, C42, in the In-
vitation Fox Hunt at Seven Springs
mountain last Sunday.

Although both Johns and Lincoff
ﬁnished, they were too late to
qualify.

The club will participate in the
Infantile Paralysis Ski exhibition at
Seven Springs mountain next Sun-
day.

Pitt Floormen Rate Michigan’s Soﬁak
Highest i11 Choosing All-Opponent Five

Pitt’s contribution to the basket-
ball all-Americas, the Panther all-
opponent team, presents an array
of court talent sharply accenting
the tough competition faced by the
high-riding Carlsonites this year.

Selected by the Pitt traveling
squad and coach Doc Carlson, the
all-opponent ﬁrst ﬁve shows Mich-
igan’s Mike Soﬁak, Illinois’ Bob Ev-
ers, West Virginia’s Jim Ruch,
Waynesburg’s Jim Brady, and Penn
State’s Johnny Barr.

Soﬁak, left-handed Michigan
tosser, whose 21 points and last sec-
ond ﬁeld goal robbed Pitt of vic-
tory, received 10 votes out of a pos-
sible 12 in balloting by the Panther
squad. Evers, Ruch, Brady, and
Barr each received eight votes.

Second team Pitt selections were
Westminster’s Stan Wasik and Buzz
Ridl, Butler’s Bob Dietz, West Vir-
ginia’s Rudy Baric, and Wisconsin’s
Gene Englund.

This all-star team is an outﬁt that
Doc Carlson would give half his
hair to coach. Michigan’s Soﬁak is
a speedy dribbler and deadly shoot-
er who almost single-handed reg-
istered an overtime win over Pitt.

Penn State’s Barr is a rugged

team player who looked so good in
defeat, even though held almost
scoreless, that the Panthers picked
him on their all-opponent team be-
fore his scoring burst sank them at
State last Saturday.

Evers of Illionis, since graduated
into big league baseball, led the
Illini in a gruelling battle which
Pitt ﬁnally pulled out of the ﬁre in
overtime.

Hottest shooter to appear on the
Stadium court this year was
Waynesburg’s “Diamond Jim” Bra-
dy, whose near miraculous pitch
shots kept the Yellow Jackets in the
game and earned him a spot on this
mythical basketball club.

Playing desperately to stem the
tide of baskets Pitt ﬁred at West
Virginia, Mountaineer Jimmy Ruch
per:'ormed brilliantly in the most
thrilling game Stadium fans wit-
nessed this year. Ruch’s long-
range popping kept the West Vir-
ginians within shooting distance of
the Panthers all night. i

Stan Wasik, labeled by Pitt men,
“Westminster’s whole defense,” and
Bob Dietz, Butler captain and scor-
ing ace, were runners-up in the
balloting.

Sophomore, Freshman Womeii
Top W7 AA Tournament Entries

Panther Trackers
To Compete Here

According to latest reports from
the Pitt athletic department, the
Panther track and ﬁeld men will
spend this Saturday in Pittsburgh
at the track house for the eighth
annual Pitt indoor championships.

Originally scheduled to appear in
Notre Dame’s ﬁeld house for the
Central Intercollegiate champion-
ships, the Olson-coached cinder
squad met a rebuff from Mr. James
Hag-an’s office and were told they
would not be on the road.

Unless there is another about face
by the administration, the freshman
and varsity spiked-ashoe brigades
will be trying to lower tthe Pitt in-
door track house records. Chief in-
terest will be centered on Del An-
derson’s attempt to lower John
Woodrutf’s half—mile mark, and
Dusty Rhoades and Red Jessup’s
try for a new pole vault record.

Quotes from Stotz

Geographer Sees Hitler

Domination of Balkans

. By IRWIN C. nosi~:N

Complete and unquestioned German control of the entire Balkan
peninsula within a short time, was the prediction of Dr. Carl Stotz, as-
sistant professor of geography, when he spoke before Pitt Town meet-

ing last Monday afternoon.

Dr. Stotz explained that the sole
chance for the establishment of an
active pro-British group in the
Balkans hinged upon some smash-
ing defeat of the German army, ad-
ministered on one of the war fronts
by the British.

The British apparently realized
this, according to the geographer,
for they tried in recent months to
establish a base in the Balkans,
from which they could extend mili-
tary operations, and temporarily, if
not permanently, halt the German
“drang nach oesten.”

Diplomatic Pressure

“The failure of the British at-
tempt to halt Germany in the
Balkans was due to the intensity of
German diplomatic pressure, which
forced the capitulation of Bulgaria
and Yugoslovia,” Dr. Stotz declared.
Not only was the threat of German
reprisals responsible for the acqui-
escence of the Balkan nations, but
the fear that England could not get
troops to the Aegean area speedily
enough for effective protection of
that area also inﬂuenced the deci-
sion, according to Dr. Stotz.

“The chief opponent of any plan
for a union in the Balkans has al-
ways been Bulgaria,” he explained,
“which has been constantly agitat-
ing for a coastal outlet on the
Aegean sea, in addition to owner-
ship of a strip of territory between
the Black sea and the great bend of
the Danube.”

Should Occupy Dodecanese

Dr. Stotz questioned. the wisdom
of the Balkan states’ refusal to give
the Bulgars this corridor to the sea,
saying, “In the light of what has
happened in the past two weeks, I
believe it would have been wiser
to have given Bulgaria the 50-mile
strip of territory, and have tried to
set up some sort of harmony among
the Balkan nations.”

The one possible blockage of a
complete German victory in the
Balkans almost came last week,
when the British conquered one of
the Italian Dodecanese islands in
the Aegean. Had Britain kept an
army of occupation on the island,
according to Dr. Stotz, she would
have had an effective wedge by
which she might have stopped Ger-
many’s drive. Britain, however,
did not keep ‘soldiers on the island,
but merely destroyed Italian air
bases there, and withdrew.

U. S. Troops? U. S. Troops!

Shifting his ground from the
Balkans to the far-east, Dr. Stotz
next discussed recent developments
of the Oriental crisis. Outstanding
among recent events across the
Paciﬁc Dr. Stotz listed as Japan’s
declaration that “the white race
must cede Oceania to Japan.” This
demand for islands in the Paciﬁc,
launched against the United‘ States,
Holland, France, and England, will
probably go ignored, he observed.

When a member of the audience
asked Dr. Stotz if he thought that
the United States could defeat Japan
in a war, he replied, “I am conﬁ-
dent thatthe U. S. would win——but
not in two weeks as some people
think.”

After the speaker had declared
that the United States should not
send an expeditionary force to
Europe, a member of the audience
asked, “Well then, what do you
think Churchill had in mind when
he said that Britain could invade
Europe without American troops?”
Dr. Stotz quickly replied, “Ameri-
can troops!”

Festival Petitions

Due by March 17

Petitions. for chairmanship of
Spring festival may still be ob-

- tained in the office of the dean of

men, announces Rae Young, BA41,
chairman of the appointments com-
mittee. The deadline for the re-
turn of these petitions is l\’Iarch_ 17.

Petitions for the chairmanship of
the Sports dance, held on Friday
night of Spring Festival week, are
also now obtainable, and the dead-
line is also March 17.

Young asks that students desig-

Robert B. Corbett, instructor in
metallurgical engineering, will lec-
ture on “Metallographic Factors
Pertinent to Inspection Problems”
before special national defense
classes in metallurgical inspection
this week and next, Dr. G. R. Fit-
terer, head of the department, an-
nounces.

A graduate of Carnegie Tech,
Corbett is one of the regular mem-
bers of the faculty to lecture to the
defense classes. During the suc-
ceeding weeks of the course, the
group will hear specialists in metal-
lurgy from local and national in-
dustrial plants and Army and Navy
ofﬁcers.

Lambi Directs
Defense Course

It’s hard to picture the digniﬁed
director of the University’s Special
Defense Training courses cavorting
around a stage, and clad in femi-
nine ruﬁies and a blonde wig.

But that’s what actually took
place in 1907 when Joseph S.
Lambie had the leading part, both
male and female, in a farce enti-
tled “The Professor’s Daughter,”
staged by the Thespians, forerun-
ner of the Cap and Gown club
which was formed the following
year.

Mr. Lambie, class of
quite a BMOC in his day.

He was editor of the ﬁrst Owl,
senior. president of his class, and a
member of the 1906 basketball
squad.

In addition to being on the fac-
ulty full-time from the day Western
University of Pennsylvania became
the University of Pittsburgh until
1929, he has acted as consulting en-
gineer for the Concrete Products
company and also lecturer in civil
engineering in the University’s
evening school.

Now that he has resumed activi-
ties as a full-time faculty member
once more, Mr. Lambie says that it
feels “great to be back in harness.”

In his spare time, our new de-
fense director put his chemical en-
gineering training to use and in-
vented a complicated heat treat-
ment for concrete.

The Pitt News

Mechanical Voice Requires
Specially Trained Operators

. By JAMES PLUNKETT

They say that a hen-peeked husband has a tough time of it, but con-

sider Voder, whose every word is governed by a woman.

But he seems

to love it, for he never talks back and has yet to criticize his master.
For Voder is a mechanical voice, and the woman angle is this:

Voder is made to talk by a touch
of a ﬁnger, and that ﬁnger belongs
to one of the few girls who have
been trained to control his intri-
cate “vocal chords.” Voder is in-
teresting, too, in that he carries a
console around on his back. This
console resembles any piano key-
board and is ﬁngered the same way.

Technically, Voder talks like this:
ﬁrst of all a hum is created by an
electrical vibration; compressed air
then comes into the picture and the
combination of the two makes a
low bass note. If played separate-
ly, they would sound like a monot-
onous hum and a loud hiss.

First of His Kind

Finally, by having his keys and
pedals pressed, Voder gets inflec-
tion in his voice and can repeat,
although sounding sometimes like
he has a mouthful of crackers, a
large vocabulary.

Our hero is an electrical appar-

atus, the ﬁrst of its kind in the
world, which creates human speech
sounds. A machine of his type has
caused experimenters in the ﬁeld
to work for over a century trying
to develop a mechanical voice. But
where mechanical attempts failed,
success was achieved through the
electrical apparatus, made possible
at a comparatively recent date
through telephone research.

Ladies’ Man

Voder was the sensation of the
San Francisco fair. Originally,
about 20 women were trained to
control him, but this number has
recently been increased due to his
widely spread popularity. Today
he is one of the most sought after
demonstrators of his kind.

Not to be outdone by a small
matter of a multi-million dollar
fair, the University has secured Dr.
J. Owen Perrine, assistant vice-
president of the American Tele-
phone and Telegraph company, who
will give a lecture-demonstration on
“The Artiﬁcial Creation of Speech,”
before a University assembly,
March 28.

Make No Mistake

Voder, of course, will make a
personal appearance, and will be
handled by a girl operator seated at
the console under Dr. Perrine’s di-
rection.

Mistakes had better not happen
twice, especially in this case. Voder
once got a little bit out of control
and told the audience to “get the
hell out of here, I’m tired.”

Needless to say, he was immedi-
ately black—listed by the American
Society of Orators.

Military Ball Head Promises
Swing, Sweet, Latin Tempos

A plan to satisfy advocates of all types of popular music has been
formulated by the military ball committee, announces George Maruschak,
C41, chairman, for the annual formal to be held at the Hotel William

Penn. March 28 from 10 to 2 o’clock.

For the swing fans, Benny Good-
man and his orchestra will play in
the main ballroom. Eddie Weitz, in
the Cardinal room, will feature his
sweet music for those who prefer
to sway rather than swing.

In the Urban room, for the Am-
erican gauchos and senoritas who
like their music in the South Amer-
ican vein, Billy Le-Roy will ﬁll the
air with the strains of rhumbas and
tangos.

For added enjoyment in the
Urban room, six couples of the
Arthur Murray school will demon-
strate the latest Latin steps and
then mingle with the crowd, help-
ing those who desire assistance.

For typical atmosphere, the
Urban room will be decorated in
palms and South American murals,
stated Robert M. Caldwell, E42,
decorations chairman.

For the other two rooms a mili-
tary theme will prevail.

Tickets for the dance will be lim-
ited to two for every senior and
junior in the ROTC and one for
each freshman and sophomore in
the ROTC. Members of the ROTC
of other schools and members of
the regular army, navy, marine, and
reserves may purchase tickets at
the military department. The price
of tickets is $3

Students will have the opportu-
nity of purchasing corsages through
the military department, if they
wish.

Dr. L. W. Bass of Mellon insti-
tute will speak on “Opportunities in
Industry for Young Chemical En-
gineers” at 8 o’clock tonight in Mel-
lon institute auditorium.

“Engineering Importance of Heat
Insulating Materials” is the subject
of R. H. Hellman, of Mellon insti-
tute, who will appear in the audi-
torium tomorrow morning at 11:30

fraternity will offer a scholarship
award to any non-fraternity Jewish
woman, exclusive of second semes-

in conjunction with Scholar’s day
exercises, will be effective begin-
ning the ﬁrst of September.

Alpha Phi Delta
Listed as Club

Alpha Phi Delta, Italian men’s
fraternity which has been inactive
since 1934, was refused recognition
as a campus fraternity by men’s
fraternity committee, announces
Robert R. Corley, assistant to the
dean of men and secretary of the
committee.

Possessing a charter from its na-
tional office, but not officially recog-
nized as a campus fraternity, Alpha
Phi Delta has, at present, the status
of a social club.

Before becoming a fraternity, the
club must pass a probationary pe-
riod of one year in which it must
meet certain standards and require-
ments set by men’s fraternity com-
mittee, stated Mr. Corley.

President of Alpha Phi Delta’s re-
organization committee, Paul F. Cer-
chiara, C42, said, “Although the de-
cision of 1nen’s fraternity commit-
tee was not in complete accord with
the optimistic future that Alpha Phi
Delta’s reorganization had planned,
I feel that all is not lost and a fa-
vorable solution will be arrived at
in the near future. As long as
there is a demand on this campus
for an Alpha Phi Delta chapter, I
pledge myself to do everything in
my power to see that just recogni-
tion is received. I want to thank
all those who have, and will con-
tinue, to help me in the days
ahead.”

Ceramic Group
Meets Tuesday

“Creative Development in Ce-
ramics” will be the general theme
for the annual meeting of the Pitts-
burgh section and art division of
the American Ceramic society to
be held next Tuesday. J. Paulin
Thorley, professor of ceramics, is
chairman of the evening program
for the meeting.

During the afternoon, tours to
various points of interest in the Ca-
thedral and on campus will be con-
ducted. Members of the society will
visit the exhibit of Pittsburgh As-
sociated artists and the exhibit of
American Sculpture.

Hotel Webster Hall will be the
scene of the annual art dinner at
6:30 o’clock at which Ross. C. Purdy,
secretary of the society, will act as
toastmaster. J. L. Carruthers, pres-
ident of the society, will represent
his group.

The evening program, at which
Thorley will preside, will take place
in the auditorium of the Mellon
institute at 8:30 o’clock. Appearing
on the program will be the Rev. J.
L. Kelso, archeologist from the
American School of Oriental Re-
search, who will talk on “Ceramic
Archelogy.” Frazier Smith, design-
er for the Hazel-Atlas lass corpor-
ation, Marvin G. Yutzy, designer for
the Fostoria Glass company, and
H. Edward Winters, ceramic artist,
will also speak.

Hovey to Criticize
Current Paintings
At Art Symposium

Walter Read Hovey, professor
and head of the department of ﬁne
arts, will speak from the critic’s
point of View in the symposium on
the paintings of Robert Gwathmey
to be held at the Contemporary
book store, Wood street, on Sunday
evening at eight o’clock.

Four viewpoints, that of the art-
ist, the critic, the layman, and the
negro will be given. Gwathmey
will discuss the artist’s point of
view; J. H. Mulligan will give the
layman’s opinion; and the negro’s
angle will be presented by Lynn
Hooe.

Mr. Hovey, a personal friend of
Gwathmey, believes that his paint-
ing is signiﬁcant because of its sin-
cerity and its vital connection with
problems of life.

Gwathmey won the Associated
artists’ prize for water colors with
his “Sharecroppers,” the oil paint-
ing of which is now at the Con-
temporary book store. Many of his
paintings which we-re in the Amer-
ican Contemporary Artists’ gallery
are included in the exhibit.

Dunn Will Play
In ‘Golden Boy’

Another name has been added to
the cast of Clifford Odetts’ “Golden

memorial. James Dunn, C44, will
take the part of Tokio, originally as-
signed to Bob Gestrich, C41.

The three-act comedy which cen-
ters around the prizeﬁghting ring,
will star Lawrence Morris, BA44,
in the title role made famous by
William Holden in the ﬁlm. Jea-
nine Stephenson, C42, has the lead-
ing feminine role of Lorna, the ﬁght
manager’s moll. The part was orig-
inated by Frances Farmer in the
stage production, and portrayed by
Barbara Stanwyck in the movie
version.

Leo Harter, C42, and Bob Ryan,
E41, have the leading character
roles of Mr. Bonaparte, and the
ﬁght manager, respectively. The
sets are being designed by Bill Mc-
Elwain, C41, and August Trovaioli,
C43.

“Golden Boy” will mark the close
of Pitt Players regular season, but
they plan to make a movie of the
entire production which will be
shown sometime in May. Action in
the ﬁlm will be directed by Buell
Whitehill, assistant professor of
English and director of the Players,
while photography will be super-
vised by Philip C. Elliott, professor
of ﬁne arts.

Local Business

Shows Decline

Bureau of Business Research re-
ports business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict declined appreciably last week,
owing to seasonal inﬂuences and
actual decreases in operations.

A drop of nearly three points was
recorded in the Bureau’s seasonally
adjusted index of business, from
141.5 per cent of the 1923-25 aver-
age in the week ended February 15
to 138.6 last week. Compared with
the peak reached at the beginning
of the year, the index last week
was found to have fallen about six
points below.

No change was made in the num-
ber of blast furnaces in operation
in the district last week, and, on
the whole, the operating rate of the
steel industry remained unchanged.
Production of electric power and of
bituminous coal decreased, however,
and originating freight shipments
fell off decidedly with decreases
being reported in both rail and river
tonnage.

Department store sales and new
motor car registrations increased
about the usual seasonal amount,
the Bureau reports. Sales of Pitts-
burgh department stores were
about seven per cent higher in the
four weeks ended February 22 than
in the same four Weeks a year ago.

In total sales in the ﬁrst eight
weeks there was an increase of a
little more than eight per cent
above the total in the same period
of 1940.
