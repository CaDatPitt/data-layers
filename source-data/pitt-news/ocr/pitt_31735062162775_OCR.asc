In a unanimous decision-, Men’s Council has votedfagainstﬁ

Under the new plan, a day in mid-March would bve”-set

Chief Justice Herb Dodell said
that the new plan was not a good
idea because an inside aﬂ-‘air
would lack the “carnival atmo-
sphere” and would thereby cut
down on possible attendance.

M.C. President Ray Rowney
said, “Since Greek Week will be
held during the week of Feb. 22,
there would be no time for the
fraternities, who wish to par-
ticipate in both programs, to
prepare for two separate shows.
Therefore, why not ' hold the
.carnival after the winter ' tri- ‘
mester ends in. ‘ pril.’’ _ _

Herb Dodell replied that since
Pitt is becoming more and more
an 7 out-of-town school«the dorm
students would be returning home
for the summer and therefore,
there would not be any interest or
support for -the affair. "V

“I would suggest that there
If-‘~,:Ire widespread evidences of the
a same kind of spiritual and psy-

 stated. “People feel that the
 ' ends of.life can be ﬁlled by ma-

" ‘-not an end.”
, M" The answer for the future? Ac-
cording to Schlesinger, “We must
' be clear about our object. More
‘important things must have ﬁrst
' claim, then the less important.”
. IN COMPARING THE economic
programs of the USSR and the
US, Schlesinger, noted that Soviet
izconomy is growing three times
_’ faster than American economy.
I ' In defense, Russia, in the next
‘ decade, is predicted to surpass
I the U.S. in production of ICBM"s
by at least a three-to-one mar-
gin. This, he said, has hap-
pened because the Soviets are
focusing their attention and tal-
cuts on the most important
products.

titles of 'Professor of English. and‘ '

 

4*‘-f1‘om nine to four,”

By HARRY LEWINTER
Currently engrossed in writing about the people and
places of 15th century England, Dr. 'Percial Hunt, pro-
_fessor emeritus of English and the Humanities, celebrated .

his 82nd birthday this month.

Professor Hunt ﬁnally has the time to do some writing
now that he is retired. During his 20 years as head of the
English department, he never hadO ‘ -

much time to write books. He was
also a teaching member of the

faculty, and as such, held fast to.

his firmest conviction. He once
said, “I think most teachers had
better teach’ and not talk about
it.” _
.-f‘That’s the way he felt about
it. To him teaching is a never-
ending job,” said one of his for-.
mer students. “Even though he
has been retired these past 11
years he still works in his office
says Mrs.
Starrett,,a colleague of his.
‘<He’s either working on his
new book or offering helpful-
criticism or advice on writing to
a student. Many of his former
students.make a. special effort to
visit him; they -not only con-
sider him a friend, but a great.
teacher.” V V

When Dr. Hunt ﬁrst came. to
Pitt in 1922 he organized and
headed the department" of English
and continued in that capacity for
about two decades. ‘From then,
until he reached his retirement at
the age of 70, he served the de-
partment has a teaching member
ofthe faculty.

A native of" Ceda_r‘Falls, Iowa,
Dr. Hunt later headed the English
department at the University of
Iowa, where he was graduated in
1900. There he received his B.
and M.A. When he came to the
University he received his doctor-
in literature. He held the

Professor at Large until his re-
tirement in 1948. _
“Above all‘ he is a modest
man,” say his colleagues. “He’s
not interested and never has
been interested in personal pub-
licity. _He’d rather have some-
one else ‘do the talking for him ‘
than talk about himself.” '
At a receptickm, held in honor
of his retirement, the university
presented Dr. Hunt with an offi-
cial silver medallion to honor his
26 year career of service. But per-
haps the greatest, test'mony to
Professor Hunt’s lsucc ss as a
teacher-was when he was .present-

ed with a volume of essays, stu- A

dies in English Literature, writ-

The Book was published by the

Dr. Hunt is loved.and respect-

fessor Hunt did more than lec-
ture his students,” one of them
said. He inspired us to think
clearly and be alert for detail .
in the material we studied. He

taught ‘in his classroom that a?”

honestly what he feels to be

Gladys Schmidt, the,'Pittsb}.1rgh
novelist once said, '
“He loved and respected the
literature. he taught. When he
closed theedoor of his classroom"
, he made a temple of the place.
He breathed into us some of his
own understanding and devo-
tion, and he gave to those, of us
who\meant togbe writers a kind
of_' reverent pride.” ' '
Dr.‘ ‘Hunt - wrote several texts

while he taught here. Among
them are: “An Outline on Com-

position,” “Student Themes” and ‘

“Hidden Streams, Essays on Writ-
”_ But, his latest contribution
to iiterature is titled “Samuel
Pepys in the Diary.” It is a, com-
plete account, of the middle -and
upper reachesof society of 17th
‘century London.

In the book Pepys is shown as
a person of great variety and sta-
ture. Dr. Hunt writes: “Pepys
wasiunendingly interested by his
own experiences and by- what
went on around? him. Often in
the Diary he‘ is so absorbed into
what he is writing, so intensely
lost and centered in it, that the
moment he is telling gets to have
for him no time before or after."‘
' “Last year the book on Pepys’

was accepted for publication by
the Oxford University Press,”
said Mrs. Starrett. “Not many
books have that honor. It is a
triumph for Dr. Hunt and a tri-
umph for the University.”

Professor Hunt is also the auth-
or of numerous articles on poetry
and teaching. He has written that
a university is “essentially ' a
spirit "which makes} alive the
buildings and the. learning.

In it, if it justifies its cost in
money and time and hope, is
made manifest, intangible quali-
ties which men have called by‘
many names —— honesty, security,
good sense; humanity, freedom,
beauty, Wisdom; the steadfastness
of courage, the energy of a‘fight-
er, peace.” .

' And as Dr.’ Percival Hunt, Pro-
fessor Emeritus, has said, “A good
teacher is a‘ good man-, teaching.”

A proximately two years ago the ideaof--a teacher
eval ation program for the university was mentioned; The

ibruptlyf Nolreason‘ ever was given as to why the idea
"“killed.”A T i _ '   .  L ,

S rice that timenothing, except perhaps an isolated in-

t; ‘such an ,evaluationAAvsystem. It is unfortunate that this is
the case. A teacher and course evaluation program -would be
at most valuable "and interesting addition here. ' ,

 There are various methodsthat could be employed for

handle the program the two logical centers for running it
._Ould be, the newspaper or student government. At several
 ‘League institutions the newspaper conducts the teacher
'”’n“d‘".course_ survey. They pass out forms in. each class, col-.
ect:-Jthnem after a day or two and compile the information.

 They ‘may’ either publish theevaluations in an issue of
,9 a~per' or» publish a special pamphlet in which they list

 

ditorial board of the Crimson, "has, been described" as a
 friorgus but honest evaluation. «  - AA ' -
Theother alternative would be to have the -program? run

The evaluation would be beneﬁcial not only to the stu-
 but also to the faculty who would be able to learn

dent opinion and judge their eﬁectiveness accordingly.

By JACK SMITH '
the Field House, ‘charity night, a ca-

pacity crowd saw the Panther basketball team, not in a g_iving
mood, take advantage of 36 charity throws’ that helped them
to. a 75-61 win over the Westminster Titans.

Even more amazing then

that the Panthers played, was
cent from the floor.
fact when you know that the team
has been floundering through a
mediocre season that has been
splattered by shooting inconsist-
ancies.

Coach Bob Timmons, who us-
ually prefers a control type game,
had his boys work for the good
shot. Although the team at times
showed signs of not knowing what
to do with the ball, they did man-

age to get the ball through the '

hoop when they shot.

The Panthers made 24 of 40
shots, while the Titans could only
hit on 23 of 76. The real story was
told on the foul line. The Cats hit
27 -while the Titans garnered 15.

Defensively the P a n t h e r s
looked good." Led by John Frid-
ley with 11 rebounds, the team
showed real signs of knowing
the defensive game. Should the
Panthers continue to play *the
type ball they did Saturday, they

.might be able to finish the sec-
ond half of the season around
the .500 mark. '

Scoring on drives and’ foul
shots, the Panthers managed to
gain a 30-25 halftime lead. But
early, in the second half West-
minster came back to tie th e
game at 38 all behind the ﬁne)
shooting of Chuck_ Davis.

Fridley Leads Way

At this point John Fridley, went
to work and along with the scor-
‘ ing aid of Bob Sankey, Paul Lazor

A startlirfg O

the 40 minutes of basketball

the fact that they shot 60 per,

and a few baskets by the other
members of the team, put the
game well out of the Titan’s
reach.

Holding a ,65—47 lead with
only four minutes remaining, it
looked as though the Panthers
had the game in the bag. But
the Titans, who had been, using
asemi-press all night started to
apply the pressure.

Jack Steel and Davis led an
attack that brought Westminster

‘within ten points, but two foul

shots by,Dick Falenski and ﬁve
points by Fridley carried the Pan-
thers to their second straight win
and the sixth of the campaign in
13 outings.

' Fridley was the scoring ace for
the Cats as he hit nine for 12 from
the ﬁeld and six for six from the
foul line for 24 "points. ‘Others
hitting in double ﬁgures were
Falenski, 18,. John Mills, 13, and
Sankey, 10.

The Panthers will get a rest
this week before they take on
Penn State this‘ Saturday at
University Park.

In the first game of the triple-
header Carnegie Tech managed to
edge Duquesne 58-52. This was
the ﬁrst time Tech had beaten the
Dukes in 23 years. '

The Steelers gained a sudden
death overtime win, 22-20, over
the Pirates in the game tha
seemed to please the fans.

Hirst, Treese Receive Praise

Of Orange Coach as Cats Win  

By LARRY HAGGERTY
For the past four seasons

Coach Warren Neiger’s Pan-
ther gymnastics team has
been noted for its particularly
overwhelming strength in two
particular events, tumbling
and flying rings. And it looks like’
1960 will prove to be no excep-
tion. ‘

-— If you doubt this previous as-
sumption, just listen to what
Syracuse’s gymnastics coach, Paul
Romeo, had to say after his
Orange gymnastc had been unex-
pectcd1y-. trounced by Nei.ger’s
Jungle Cats 581/2 -361/2 at the Field
House last Saturday afternoon.

“We came down to Pittsburgh
with the idea of beating -Pitt but
never had much of alchance after
falling behind 12-4 in tumbling.
Then with guys like‘ Dave Hirst
and Tom Treese on the rings
you’re shooting for__ third place in-

stead of first or second.”
* * *

The most surprising results of
the meet, however, turned out to
be the Blue and Go1d’s 13-3
sweeps of the high bar and rope
climb. Sophomore Howard Coley
won the rope with a time of 4.3
seconds and was closely followed
by teammates Joe Battaglia and
Ron Daugherty with clockings of
4.4 each.

.Co-captain D-on Kasner put to-
gether a beautiful routine“ to take
the high bar with a point aggre-

gation of 247. Teammates Hirst“

and Jack Rainaldi were runners-
up with totals of 226 and 209 re-
spectively.

Sophomore Earl McConnell ca -
tured tumbling ‘for the Panthers
with a score of 261. Hirst was
next with 230 while Battaglia
ﬁnished fourth with 172_ points.

Syracuse’s captain, Ed Levine,
scored a double by winning the
side horse and parallel bar events
with respective scores of 241 and
257. -

Unexpected help in the heavieié

divisions, enabled the Panthers to
turn in their lopsided win against
the Orange who were ranked sev-
enth in the nation. The Panthers
were not among thetop ten.

some serious trouble _in the next

Les Austin to a draw, the Cats
never did see that trouble.

By RON MASER 7

After running their winning
streak to four games, the Panther‘ '
freshmen suffered a 75-74 over-
time loss to Bethany College JV’s
on Saturday. The loss brought tue

Frosh’s season record to ﬁve wins’
and two defeats.

«In notching their fourth con-
secutive victory the Cub?s tri- ~
umphed over J ohnstown Center
by the score of 98-67 Wednesday
on the losers court.

Coach Carl Peterson ‘alternated
his ﬁrst and second teams
throughout the contest. The squad
responded by setting a season
scoring high of 98 points. Leading
scorer for the Panthers Was Ben.
Jinks with 25.

Following Jinks in the scoring
column. were John Maczuzcak

points respectively. The 75-74
setback to Bethany was a heart-

end of regulation time.’

In the overtime period they,
gained a four point advantage but
were unable to hold the lead, and
ﬁnally bowed by a single point.
The Yearling’s second' unit of
Slaby, Law, Larkin, Hu hes and
Grgurich played the mgljor role
in the comeback drive that knot-
ted the score.

Jinks, Larkin and Howdy Dap-

with Jink’s .20 being high. The
Panthers’ next game is away with

Students Fail To
5 Support Panther
 Athletic Teams

‘If a poll were taken of all the colleges inthe country,
Pitt would undoubtedly rank last in student bodyathletic
support. Our students should be ashamed of the Way they
back. their teams. - _‘

There is no excuse for the turn-out at basketball games,

wrestling matches, football and soccer games and all the
: other athletic events. 1 ‘
 "Even the high schools in western Pennsylvania receive
more support from their students than the Panthers hoopsters
get here at Pitt. The high school students make their games
a meeting place where the gang can get together and have
some fun while supporting the team.

But what happens at Pitt—the fraternities and soror-

 ’_ , ities spend more time in the Tuck Shopthan they do in

r contributing ‘to the school’s reputation. All over Pitts-'
burgh the Pitt students are known for their lack of
support.  —‘

At every basketball game, with the exception of
Duquesne and West Virginia, there is only a handful of
students watching the Panthers. I said watching the Pan-
thers, not cheering them. They sit in the bleachers like they

g were at a ‘funeral parlor. '
I The students give all kinds of excuses for not attending
~ -- these events. The most common one is, ‘_‘Why should I .go up
l" there and see those lousy games? I could play better basket-.
‘ ball myself.” Well, maybe if they supported the team, the
Panthers would play better basketball. In -contrast to the
games played at the (Field House, everytime the Panthers
play abroadithey see the enthusiasm that is‘ generated by
the students of other schools. .
_ If thestudents would go up the hill and root for the
Panthers, I guarantee that the team ‘would play better
, basketball. Just take the Steel Bowl as an .example——there
 was a‘ large turnout of students, and the“Panthers played

1”’ like champs. _

In other sports the response i-s apathetic. We have one
of the country’s better ,wrestling teams at Pitt, but how many
students go to the wrestling matches? Just a handful who
know the Wrestlers personally. This _is unfair to the whole

team. These boys practice six days a week, then have to go -

out and perform in front ofhjust a couple of fans. When they
have meets on the road, they face a whole gym full of hostile
people; but there is no comfort for the Cats at home.

I guess Writing about it Won’t change the situation. The
next home athletic contest will still feature the unenthusias~
tic, absent Pitt students who stay in the dorm and study,
watch television, or ﬁnd something ‘else to do rather than
support their school team. It looks as though the students
