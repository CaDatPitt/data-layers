,, name was already well known
-among readers of poetry as a_
.-’wrAitAer ;of jdescriptive lyrics of
" ‘unusual vividness ‘and fervor,-
A and the publication of “Carolina;
”Cha‘l1sAons_” .in_1923- justified the
expeyc-tations'of his friends as to
llis"=-‘distinct promise." In". this
book his —con"tributions were nar- A
rative" and descriptive poems of
that memorable southern shore,
‘ ‘in ~‘whic1"1‘ the‘-“"esselIce‘ ‘of the land-
sc"ape- and" the qualities of the
land were caught in words. .
But He1'vey.Allen‘is more than
a local poet.. He" is one. of the
ﬁrst of our times to" enrich
poetry withhis deep feeling for
" the new world which-science has
made. " . ‘ i A
In his new" book, “Earth.
Moods,” the evolutionary struggle
from ﬁre. mist to man is not so
much described as felt tl1rough-
out as a. background which gives
a new signiﬁ-canoe to the com.-
monest things. - " A A
His “Northern Earth Mood” is
a gorgeous , moving picture of
history, seen -as the‘..m-ode-rn sees
it, but more romantic and more
vivid than legendary ‘stories.
“Children of Earth? is a striking
narrative of the effects of envir-
onl"neut—-a story of the man who
loves the mountains ma‘rried to
the woman whose imagination is
stirred ‘by the sea, Such longer
poems give the theme, and make
the particular distinction of Mr.
. ‘Allen's book, which is intensely .
nlodern in spirit while remaining
classically_ beautiful in form.
There are also ﬁne lyrics of.
places in his earlier manner a.nd
such evo-cations of moods‘ "of the
South as “Funeral at High Tide."
Among the several poets of real -
distinction who -,belong to the‘
poetic renascence of the last de"-_ ’
cede in America, Hervey ,Alle_n
‘is uniquely interesting. His"
thin_kin‘g and his feeling for the
modern spirit are vital and com-
- pelling. ‘ - '
Readers have been asking for
American poetry which has a
vigorously in.-digenous quality.‘
"Earth Moods” has this quality
pre-eminently. - ‘

.-‘GOV,E»RNM‘EN‘T AT PITT’.

To The Editor: . _ ,

The suggestion was made, in The
Weekly, ‘a good’ while‘ ago,‘ that‘ per-
haps
never could be a sticcess, that the
present organization had‘ ‘failed ‘to
make itself ‘felt on the campus and

. had notbecome, the powerful. inﬂuence

that a student government should be.
Whether these critics .- still -hold to
their contentions or. not,_ I do not_

know, but _I would like ‘to ‘give ’a.brief_
discussion of ‘the various ‘phases, of.
. activity ‘of the ‘ present organization,‘

its a'ccompl_i's_hments‘ and its difﬁcul-
ties, 9and the. possibilities ahead of
the new organization ‘next year.

Let us. ‘consider the acc_ompli‘s‘h-.
ments-of the past. year. First, and-.
most important of all t_o__my mind is
the establishment 7 of . .a sound ‘ and
stable-"organizatiOn., regular in meet‘-

ings, and ‘highly interested in student
affairs. -‘If we look-"back on previous

experiences, this‘ is a fundamental
and-primary objective which has here-ﬂ

- tofore never _been attained, and in ‘it-‘

self is a criterion of”success.' Then
consider ,tl,fe...re,organization of .claSs‘
government, '__a change which was cer-
tainly needed under" -pl'e‘Sé1l‘t‘ condi-
tion The reviving of freshman re-
glll ions, anda means, of enforce-
ment is‘ another move which has been
favoredby the student body, =

.Informlation.Gathered‘." - _
.During the year, M. S. G. A. has
made a‘ numbervof 'in-vestigations in-—
to important _ campus-V organizations,
such as ‘the University Book Store,
the University‘ ‘_Band, The Pitt Week-
ly, the Junior,-‘Class, and the Senior
Class. While cdeﬁnite action did not
result in each case. much Iinforniation}

‘ was u_nc_overed andrecommendationsv

were ‘made. ’- The Men’s ‘ Vocational

. ‘Conference, while turned over to Y.
- M. C. _A., was} sponsored and ﬁnanced’

by‘ M.. ‘S.  A., as‘-was the ‘O. D. .K.
Activities -Smoker. Then, of course,
there, was -tl_1‘e_ choosing of men on
committees to .manage, Pitt ‘Week
and the spring election‘. Many other
items came up. for consideration,
some of little importance ‘perhaps, and:
many to no deﬁnite conclusionf" but
all with the good of the "school in
mind. All representatives are mem?
bers of permanent committees and
havedone work along; suchlines as
administrative, problems, public ‘rela-

. tions, activities, and ‘scope’ of the or-

ganization. The body comprises many
of the prominent campus leaders, and
is, _we believe, 1'-epresentativ‘e of gen-
eral student opinion.f:_ Meetings are.

well attended and interestiis never
lacking. Among t-he-problems under

present‘ consideration, one of the most

important is the ‘changing of The Owl,

fI‘01T_i‘a-junior to’ a. senior publication.
Administratilonis -Attitude.

I Several rather drastic steps in the
devclOpm_ent of student go-ver'n‘m‘ent,
were considered, .but here we are
forced‘ toconsider the vital phase St
the whole subject, name1y——the atti-I
tude of the Administration. 'I‘.l1is,
leads us’ to the ‘question, “Have Over
a real Student Government in fact‘;
and authority, or is it [merely a name.
At'present, the‘
questioncannot be answered; within
a year, I think it will be. At a recent

meeting of_ M. S. G. A., the ‘attitude

of the Administration was given by.
MI‘. J. Sfteele Gow, executive s‘ec‘re-A

members with the exception‘ ofgtlﬁee

sl_Iould‘be‘ an‘ administration’ check,

As to the.Graduate' Manager, he "is
necessary‘ and ﬁlls agreat‘ need in
the-iliandling of activities, but he

‘ should--"’be ‘employed »by, and respon-

trolling activities,’ the student gov-

the, Graduate Manager, as a recent
test‘ case proved. Under these con-
ditions can owe expect the Govern-
ment to become a very powerful in-

-ﬂuence on the campus?

Lack of centralization.
But who is to blame for thisfcon-
dition of affairs? Nobody, unless the
student body itself. Student‘ Govern-
ment has heretofore failed to materi-

smooth-working, permanent and in-
ﬂuential government-to which the Ad-
ministration will gladly ‘turn A over

much authority within’ the ﬁrsb seven '

months of its existence.‘ ,
Probablyi the ‘ greatest handicap this
year has been the lack of one central
organization with whichthej Adminis-
tration‘ could deal. We had our ,1\’I.'St

this condition and give us a central

The varsity track team, home for the past three meets, will
againtake to the road, journeying to Little Washington to take part
in the Intercollegiate meetiheld annually at that city by the VV. & J".
Athletic Association. It was at ﬁrst believedthat only part of the
Pitt team wouldmake that trip, with several members’ going to the
I. C. A. A. A. A. championships to be held at Franklin Field, Phila-
delphia, but when the Law examinations were set for this week end
Ca.ptain'Corbett refused‘ to make the trip and the Pitt ofﬁcials dc-
cided to pass up the eastern champs this year and send several men
to the national championships to be held in Chicago on June 13.,

and Allegheny are doubtfulentries.
The meet will be held. at College

do not make the W. and J. trip will
compete in the AJA’. U. meet to be
heldat Kennywood Park. ' ,

Just what condition the Washing-
ton track is in is not known, but.re-

made over and that it is in much
better condition than in yearsypast.
If that be the case several Pitt run-
ners will be out to better thelocal
records. ‘The time is short now untii

better the University marks will be
accepted. Weather conditions favor-

TWO W. P. I. A. L.

I CHAMP’S MEN AWAY‘

The series of " intercollegiate
races and ﬁeld events for high
schools was productive of many
thrilling contests. "With Lock
Haven, champions of the Carnegie
Tech interscholastic meet, New
Castle, winners of the W. P. I. ‘A.
IL, and Schenley, trunner-up to
Castle, among the schools entered,
the fans were promised some real
competition and. they saw it. Lock
Haven and Schenley both had full
teams, while the VV. P. I. A. L,
champions handicapped them-
selves by sending some of their
stars, including «Day, the star

jumper and vaulter, and Early,-

440-yard; ace, to Bucknell to com-
pete in the P. I. A. A. titular meet,
which was won by Bethlehem
‘Iigh. J ackson of .Allegheny High
was also entered in this meet.
Thepresence of these men would
probably. have given. New Castle
with Allegheny
probably fourth place as Jackson
also did some ﬁne work at Buck-
nell. At the same time that the
Pitt meet was held Uniontown
High was engaged in winning the
Wasli-Jeﬂ? interscholastics.
Winners Start Early.

The Lock Haven outﬁt got off to an
early start, when Getz led the ﬁeld
in the mile run, in the speedy time
of 4:39 2-5 slightly poorer, than that
set in the College race. Hoffman,
IS‘chenle_v star, took second with the
representatives of New Castle, Tur-
tle Creek and Swissvale in the re-
maining positions. Getz’s tim.e easily
beat that set in the freshman event,
the Wash-Jeff and Bucknell meets,
and was :10 3-5 seconds better than
the time set by Rose of ‘Westminster
in winning the mile run in the Inter-
Collegiates at Geneva.

Lock Haven further strengthened
its claim to ﬁrst place when Brown-
lee and Eckert took first and fourth
respectively in the 120 yard high hur-
dles. Voight and Lewis took second
and third for Schenley with Greene
taking, fifth for Fifth Avenue I-Iigl1’s

The Yearling net squad, after hav-
ing cleaned up on Crafton, _Uniontown,
Westmont and Union in its ﬁfth,
sixth, seventh and eighth straight
wins, respectively, are facing another
week that will call for a display of
the best of their ability. _ Today they
face the Carnegie Plebe racqueteers
for the second time this season, and,
"it is- needless to say, that the wear-
ers of the;P1-aid will be back to atone
for their previous defeat. Tomorrow,
Oakmont I-Iighhwill be the Cub’s op-

~ _ponents_,_ and it"‘is rumored that they

are well represented upon the chalk-

 The Fresh team, ; as a whole, has
reached. its’ best form, and will be
‘hard to down in the future. It is only

ing the first 8-6. but dropping the
second to the hard»-driving visitor, 5-7.
Even had Scary defeated Cable, the
évisitors would have had little chance
}of winning both doubles matches to
‘tie the score. ’
' _ Show Good Tennis.
Although. Colgate failed to score 3.
point, the tennis played by the New
Yorkers was of the best seen here
this year. Scary and Cable, playing
number one match, uncorked one of
the hardest fought contests on the
Pitt courts this year. Scary was not
a spectacular player but he possessed
a steady driving game that would
have caused a less versatile player
than Cable to give up in despair. The
scores of 8-6 and 5-7 indicate how
eVeI11:~’ they were matched.
Silverman, at number two for Pitt,
ran away with Franks in the first set,
6-1, but had a tougher time to win
the second round 7-5. Franks was an-
.other terriﬁc driver, but the panther
captain displayed uncanny ability in
the first set in killing his opponents

McQuiston met a tartar in Brown-

Pitt. Just to show his gameness and
ability. the Panther came back and
‘all but slaughtered his opponent in

third point for Pitt when he defeated
