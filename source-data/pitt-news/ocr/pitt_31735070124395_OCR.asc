“Letters today  Leaders tomorrow” was the underlying

The event, hosted by the’ executive board of the-

Panhellenic Association, was called Rush Line. ,

Nearly‘ 200 anxious women filled the room, allwith ‘a

Ka Hsaw iWa has spent the
past 10 years speaking_to audi-

ences all over the world, but .
there are some mysteries that.
even a decade of globe—trotting —

hasn’t unraveled. _

“I don’t understand the
thing about underwearﬁ’ the 26-
year-old Burmese native admit-
ted last night as he offered his
take on current American fash-
ion. His American audience
hooted appreciatively, and a stu-

' dent arriving in the Cathedral a

few minutes earlier could have
mistaken the event for an early
edition of Friday Night Improv.
Within moments, however,
the tone in the room changed, as

-students, faculty and other atten- V

dees leaned forward to catch
Wa’s lilting voice as he
described his first arrest at age
17. I s

“I can’t even describe the
smell and feeling of that room,”

he ﬁnished after a sudden pause.
“I was so scared.” —

It was the first of many
nights he would spend in prison.
In his" native Burma, and
throughout much of southeast
Asia, Wa is among the govern-
ment’s most wanted. _His list of

crimes include. co-founding and
organizing the . international

organization Earthﬁrst! which
combines human rights and
environmental advocacy, while
documenting the stories of his
people. . . . V

- Even though these activities
have earned him near-outlaw
status at home, they have been

recognized elsewhere with dis-

tinctions and awards from the
International Goldman ‘Award,
Reebok and Conde Nast.

Last night, Wa appeared at

Pitt as part of International -

Week. His appearance followed
the combined efforts of local
and student chapters of Amnesty
International, a human rights

group. It’s current campaign is ' '

focused on the rights of environ-

mental activists such as Wa.

He described his childhood
as spoiled and centered mostly
around his few prized articles of
American clothing, a rarity in

Burma. At 17, however, he was -

fortable world and thrust into a
prison cell. For three days, he
was beaten, tortured and caged
as his jailors attempted to

‘retrieve _inf_ormation about one
of his friends, who had disap-

peared. , . V
Eventually,‘ after a particu-

larly violent attack, Wa aw6ke.

in the hospital.

-pulled out of his small and com- ..

\

His experience led Wa to

join a student group formed in
opposition to Burma’s p military
dictatorship. . However, the
group’s first failed demonstra-

tion led to numerous deaths. and '

sent Wa running for his life. 1
In hiding, »Wa decided that
the atrocities going on around

Staff‘ Write r

The 1ate—m'ght .crowd has been
grinding on the dance ﬂoor since “The
Professionals” hit-the stage. The gui-
tarist dishes out some mean blues
licks and the singer dips with themic

‘ and wails gritty soul, song after song.

It’s a Monday night ritual that’s

been taking place in “The Blues .

Cafe,” at the corner of 20th and
Carson streets for the past three years.

Mike Sweeney stands behind the a
other band members, slightlyoutside U

of the bright lights, and snakes his

' funky bass lines through the tunes.

He works smoothly and without
show..~He leaves the showmanship to
the rest of the band.

After the set, most of the band
members lounge around the bar, sip-
ping beer and talking with fans, but
Sweeney is in a hurry to pack his gear
and get home. . if

At 6 a.m., he starts his shift as a
paramedic for the city of Pittsburgh.

Sweeney’s dual life as a musician
who holds a day job isn’t that unusual

in itself, unless you consider that he is .
‘also a painter with a degree in fine

arts. —
Sweeney, a 49-year-o1dlPittsburgh
native, began his mrulti-faceted career
at Penn State University in the early
1970s. There he earned his degreeand

soaked up‘ a vast musical education on

- V the side.‘

He shared a house withfive musi-
cians and leamed“ to_ play the bass
because his roommates needed a bass
player to complete their band.

I Sweeney remembers the house as a

creative melting -pot, where musicians

I of all styles hung out and played until

the early hours of. the morning: A
After graduation, S_we‘eney
roamed the country for about a year.

Eventually, he made his way back to‘-

Pittsburgh and -began to look for

~ work.

Music and art had ‘given _him a-
direction, but he needed to make a liv-
ing. — _

At ‘the time, he ran into a friend
who told him about the then-new
“Manpower” training program to train
paramedics. , .

“It was one of‘ the first in the
country,” Sweeney said. “In two
months, they trained you for a career.”

While most musicians and artists
worry that choosingpa more conven-
tional career might affect their art,

 writing‘ when he’s not on call,

I I Sweeney. had no such conﬂict. He’

knew that painting and music would
be something he would do for the rest
of his life and he didn’t need to be
paid for it. ' ’ l A —

But there was another reason that
he chose to go into the training.

“I’m also a product of that 1960s
ideal of making .‘a difference,” he said.

What started out as" an “ideal
turned“ into ‘a 23-year career as an

emergency medical technician. While -

many artists find it difficult to work
full-time in such a demanding field
and remain creative, Sweeney never
stopped playing and painting. His

South Side -apartment is filled with .
-finished canvasses, and he’s written A

songs for his Monday night group and
many other Pittsburgh performers. .

' Larry Sieferse, alongtime friend
and musical » cohort, has ‘ seen
Sweeney’s creative energy first—hand.

“One time, about’l2 years ago, he
called me up and saidhe had a formu-
la for writing tunes. He’s got this ‘bag
of tricks,’ and he sits in the ambulance ‘'
Sieferse said. , . I

When Sieferse says that Sweeney
has a “bag of tricks,” he’s right.

Sweeney calls it “The Kit”. He ‘

explains the creative process as an
extension of the learning process, and

understands creation as a craft that ,
requires daily attention.

“I have a_ ‘Song Kit’ and an ‘Art
Kit.’ Both are just little bags of note

books and sketchpads that I keep with

me. Whenever I have ideas, I‘ jot,
[them] down and put it in the kit,”

. Sweeney said.

Lately, he’s been working on new .
songs, digging back deep into‘ the rich
traditions of folk music for inspira-
tion. 1 _ 1 _
- “As -a writer,‘ sometimes you have
to go backwards to go forwards,” he
said. a I I v _

Sweeney plans to do recordings of
his new ' material and maintain his
work and playing ‘schedule. Many
people would find such a busy life
daunting, but Sweeney takes it all in
stride. ' '

Having his feet firmly in two
worlds gives him a chance to use his
rich life experience to inspire his art.

Finding the energy doesn’t seem
to be a problem —— he just sets aside
time each day to work.

“There’s no shortcut to that,” he

A said as he wagged his finger, before A _

adding some personal advice. “Don’t
get caught up in,television.”*

After a quick . introduction of the

students were immediately placed into
separate groups. Each group was head-
ed by two Rho Chis, who then led them
to an area where they could further dis-
cuss the rules and events of Rush.

group to go into Rush open-minded.

“You should give every house a

Suspensions

On Tuesday, Ambridge ‘Area
High School in nearby Beaver County
suspended between 50 and 70 stu-
dents. When one hears this number, he
or she probably wonders what sort of .
behavioral problems that school has.
The kids must have done something
really bad, right? A .

You may be surprised to know
that these students were not suspended
for any gross disobedience, but instead
for wearing plain white T—shirts.

Yes, tlIat’s right, they were wear-
ing plain white T-shirts. Under the
dress code of the Ambridge Area
School District, these shirts are classi-
ﬁed as underwear, which must be
worn under clothing. :Why are they
classiﬁed this way? According to high
school principal Tom Graham,
“Undergarments manufactured and
sold as underwear are not appropriate
for school” (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
Sept. 20, 2000). 1 .

So here’s a question: What if a
manufacturer of plain white T-shirts
were to suddenly change labeling on
their packages from “undershirt” to
“shirt”? Would the dress code then
permit these shirts?

Is that your underwear showing?

The school has provided an
exception to this rule: If a shirt has a
logo or’ a pocket on it, students can
wear it. That leads to another question:
What if a student were to draw a small
logo with a permanent marker on the

for T—shirts?

 Would these shirts then be
allowed under the dress code?

Is that your underwear showing? ’

The rules in many dress codes
restrict revealirrg 910.tl1iI13zPe]i¢Ving it
a distraction. So, why then do many
schools allow students to wear basket-
ball jerseys in class, which show a lot
more skin than plain white. T—shirts?
Why is a white T-shirt’ worse?

Even in many gym classes, a
plain white T-shirt is part of the
required uniform. “

Is that your underwear showing?

Now these questions may sound -

ridiculous, but they : are only; raised.
because of the illogical nature of such
a rule. In college, what people wear is
not a big deal; it has no effect on our
learning environment. Although a

‘ dress code for high schools may be

necessary, carrying it this far isridicu-
lous. Schools have much larger prob-
lems than what students wear.
Teachers need to have the ability to

focus on teaching; why should they. ‘

waste Valuable class time checking to_

see if a student has a logo on his or her

shirt? . -
And now 50 to 70 students have

1 lost a valuable day of learning because

they decided to protest a ridiculous
rule. Although they could have tried a
different way to draw attention to this
issue, these suspensions aretoo harsh
of a punishment. They deserve better
than this.

As a history and political science major,
I frequently hear one recuning question:
“What are you going to do with that?” In our
society, obsessed with ends-based rationali-
ty, that question has taken on increasing
importance for people of our generation as
we embark on adulthood. Even as a staunch
believer in liberal arts education, I often joke
with friends majoring in more “practi ”
pursuits that they’ll be supporting an unem-
ployed Ph.D. one day.

In spite of the jokes though, I am not

that worried about my future at the moment.
Perhaps this is shortsighted idealism on my
part, but I doubt it, for liberal arts majors do
indeed accomplish things.
Liberal education has D Av] D
“practical” skills, most
importantly those involv-
ing  According to
Dean Alec Stewart of the
Honors College, many top executives say
that the best thing they ever did was to go for
aliberalartsdegreebecauseitmadethem
adaptable to dilferent situations.

While education in a ﬁeld like business
will get a person a more immediate, higher-

_ paying job right out of college, this type of I
education may not allow for as much ﬂexi- '

bility in the long run because it tends to be
more training than education; you learn
skills for one job instead of learning about a
wide variety of things.

Consider my father as an example. A‘

graduate of Pitt (CAS ‘69) with a degree in
creative writing — not the most practical
degree——hehas since goneontobe apro-
fessional baseball player, insurance agent,
news and sports anchor, ﬁnancial planner
and small business owner. In fact, he has
been successful enough at those things to be
able to serni-retire, as he puts it, at the age of
53!

Although I personallyrelish the idea of

not having to do the same job all my life and‘

reinventing myself often, this may not be for
everyone, as many enjoy job security and
consistency. .
Butwhatsidetotakeinthisdebatealso
depends on one’s goals in working. If the
goal is capital accumulation, then ends-

, based rationality makes perfect- sense. It

depends on whether one wants, as Dr. James
Malloy puts it, a “profession” or a ‘Voca-
tion.” In this context, vocation does not
mean manual labor but instead “calling,”

The people in the business school are great

Haff starts second half of career at Pitt

FRAN AIELLO
Staff Writer

Many college students have con-
sidered transferring at some time or
another. It is not uncommon for some-
one to become unhappy with their cur-
rent college experience and decide to
do something about it.

The same holds true for college
athletes. One such story is volleyball
player Heather Haff’s decision to

9 transfer to Pitt from Kansas State.

Haff decided to return to her
hometown this summer to play on
Pitt’s volleyball team.

She made the most of an unfulﬁll-
ing two years at Kansas State before
calling it quits and coming to Pitt

where she can take a more active role,

on the team.

Her decision was made easier by
Pitt’s new head coach, Chris Beerman,
and she seems to have developed under
his tutelage.

“I loved Kansas State, but I wasn’t
going to get the shot I wanted,” Haff
said. “I felt like a cheerleader.”

As the tallest girl in her eighth
grade class, Haff drew the attention of
coaches and although she was recruit-
ed for basketball, she opted to play
volleyball and never stopped. I

high school volleyball at North
Allegheny in the northern suburbs of
Pittsburgh.

With an impressive list of accom-
plishments including first team all-
state, all—section and all-Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League honors, she had no problem
getting picked up by a serious colle-
giate Volleyball program.

Haff comes from a family full of
Big East athletes. Her father played

A football for ‘West Virginia and her
older brother, Matt, played football for

Boston College.
She began her career as a redshirt

‘and played in five matches and record-

ed a near double-double in November
1997, tallying a career—high 10 kills
and eight digs.

As a redshirt sophomore, she
played in just four games. -

Haff has dedicated herself to the
Pitt program as she strives to take her
game and the Panthers to a higher
competitive level. .

She now works with Beerman and
the rest of the Panthers to make her
remaining time as a college athlete
successful.

“Most people see me as a person

with a passion and a gift who. simply,

wants to fulfill her potential,” Haff
said.
Though she is “the new kid on the

block,” she slipped right into the
revamped program which
underwent a change of coaches after
the end of last season when Beerman
replaced Cindy Alvear. V

“We practice three hours a-day and
have weight training and strength exer-
cises,” she said. “It doesn’t give me a
chance to think about the new sur-
roundings.” ,

With three of five tournament
weekends complete, Haff said the tour-
naments take a toll on schoolwork, but
she seems sure the tournaments will
help her and the team develop quicker.

.“Sometimes I feel drowned in
schoolwork,” she said, “but this last
weekend, the team really started to
bond” she said.

She is an English writing major
and wants to become a high school

. English teacher’ when she graduates

but will probably not be able to resist
the chance to coach volleyball.
In her spare time, she also enjoys

photography, singing and working

with ministries.

 

. Beerman has been quite impressed
with Haff’s endurance and said she has
a quick and explosive style of play and
great potential. '

Haff_has nothing but good words
for her new coach.

“He’s very honest, never plays
favorites and he works us really hard,”
Haff said. She heard about Beerman as
a coach through a friend.

So far, Haff has played well for the
Panthers. _

In the Pittsburgh Invitational on
Sept. 8-9, she racked up 23 kills and
eight blocks.

When asked about Pitt’s faltering
performances against Utah State and
Indiana, she cited mental preparedness

I as their major downfall.

“A lot of mental stuff goes into
games like that.” she said. “You want
to come to a point where you play your
best at all times.”

Beerman and the Panthers will be
looking to achieve this mindset soon
with the Big East competition begin-
ning on Sept. 30. "

Some events in Olympics are just laughers

I know you’re probably not one of those peo-
ple who is going to stay up until the wee hours of
the morning to watch continuous live coverage of
the Olympics" on CNBC and MSNBC.

In fact, do you even know the Olympics are

going on? Ratings are at their worst for the Sydney
Games.

Most ' Americans
aren’t getting into it like
they used to, but I don’t
understand why,

It’s one of the truest
forms of competition in some
of the weirdest, stupid-ass
sports you can feast your eyes
on.

   
   
  
  

I’ll start at the beginning,
alphabetically: » ‘

Archery ,

Now before I start tearing apart
these sports, I do believe the competitors in-all
Olympic sports are athletes and that-the competi-
tion is in fact, heated.

Sorts View

Brad
Cuprik

OK, that aside, archery is so boring. I can’t‘

fathom sitting in front of ‘the television at any hour
of the day and watching somebody fire an arrow at
a bull’s-eye. . I

.T his sport:;,may- have been popular in.the_,days;

of Robin ,Hood:andt.the Sheriff of Nottingham," but
watching ;it.,ma;_kes me wantthe arrdw to .corn"eo_ut
of the screen and pierce my eyeball; » ’ '

Badminton 

. over -=—c;utei fences

Besides the fun of saying word “sh»1ittle- '

cock,” there islittle to like in watching badminton.
' To put it in simple terms, two people have
small rackets and blast a shuttlecock back and
forth at speeds that rival _certain race cars. You
can’t see the shuttlecock on the screen. It’s a blur.
I think Fox Sports needs to get involved and high-
lightvit blue. 
A Plus, no Americans are go.odat.b,adminton, ‘so
I found myself, rooting against every competitor,
which makes itboring-.» *  . A. _

Canoe/Kayak . - _    A .

C‘. Youmust be joking" if youlike tq.éwatch' canoe-
ing or kayaking ‘while munching onf"si)_r'necPring1es
and drinking aDr P6PPer. ~ "  i  ’

screen, and I’d start watching re—runs of Survivor,
too, V

If the competitors crashed into rocks more
often or had their boats flippedupside down, then
I’d watch. Hey, I’m in themajority when I say that.

Cycling

It’s not so much the outdoor races or the
mountain bike racing, but the indoor cycling.

These athletes get on a bike, held up by
their coach or they will fall off because the
track is slanted like an auto racing grid.
Two bicyclists race against each other on what
looks like a gymnasium ﬂoor, if you can call it a
race. «
‘It starts out really slow and it loses me
right away. If it’s a race, shouldn’t they be
sprinting? All of a sudden, halfway through
the race, both bicyclists speed up and try to
stay in front of the other.
It’s confusing, even to describe.

Equestrian -

. Do I really need to point out why watching
horses jump over fences is not mylcup of tea?
Sure. ,

There’s no contact. No bodies hitting water. No
bodies hitting each other. No racing against anoth-
er competitor.-Itis a person riding a horse, jumping
"for style points and against a

c‘lock;-Q  _ ~— _ - _ »
If-’t:,l1,efy_ rode a llama"-or a camel, I’d watch.

 ’ V ’ _ - ~ -

. . I like -the basic idea of fencing, but to make it
better for.viewers, allow ‘a powerful electric shock
to run» through the loser’s body when he or she is
hit.

I’m not in favor of pain or violence; these are

. just helpful hints if NBC wants more viewers. a

 

A gfeaturingJe$se,SauriclAM

_Judoi

Handball .

I just found out what handball was a week ago,
and I wanted to see it. That’s a mistake I wish I had
never made. » - .

, It’s. like jai alai or racquetball with nothing but
your hands. It’sa game you used to play against a
wall when you 7 had nobody to play with or you
couldn’t find a bat, a glove, or a stick.

Again, the United States is not very good at
handball, so it’s not particularly attractive to me. »

Wt-27-1 "um

 IDA 

 

This one has personal reasons behind it,
because I took judo lessons once. During the first
lesson, we were taught how to flip people over our
backs. A kid, about 50 pounds lighter and seven
inches smaller than I was, threw me halfway across
the gymnasium floor.

I was not going to learn something where any-
one could kick my ass if they wanted to. I quit the
next week and I’m not watching it now.

Sailing

I know there’s an America’s Cup and that peo-
ple are interested in sailing, but this is the most
ridiculous sport I’ve ever seen televised.

I felt so betrayed by NBC when they put this
on at 3:00 a.m. I felt betrayed by the sporting
world. Don’t make me watch somebody sail a boat.

That’s not a sport. That’s a leisure activity. I go
sailing when I’m on vacation. I don’t do it for a
career, but apparently, some people do.

Well, shiver me timbers and man the decks.
Where were the sharks that threatened the triathlon
competitors at? They should be attacking these
sailboats.

Weightlifting
_ This sport sickens me. I cannot watch a burly
musclehead lift 20,000 pounds over his or her head
while looking very constipated.

I’ve lifted weights before, and it is a rush, and
it helps build muscle power. Some people do it
competitively and that’s fine, too, but don’t make

. megwatch it. *

My remedy would be to show more of the other
sports, which NBC does during the prime-time
hours.

My favorite sport to watch is table tennis. It’s
almost like badminton, except that it’s so funny to
watch the competitors.

They look like robots, hitting the ball every
two seconds, back and forth. I actually saw a guy
from Taiwan get so upset at another player for his
movement before a serve.

He kept complaining and raising his hands in
the air, like he was distracted. If you can hit a ball
the size of a strawberry every two seconds, don’t
tell me about distractions.

That’s entertainment.

Pitt News and is waiting for the 3,000-meter
steeplechase to begin.

PREVIEW

their last trip to Pittsburgh, winning
25-21, after trailing 21-3 at halftime in
1998. McMahon was also Rutgers’
quarterback for that game but missed
last year’s home game against Pitt, a
38-15 loss.

The Panthers lead the all-time
series, 14-3, and are hoping that their
impressive defense continues to domi-
nate and the offense continues to ﬁnd
the end zone. .

Several Panthers could move up
on Pitt’s all-time lists in different cate-
gories. D .

Kicker Nick Lotz needs 10 p.oints
to move from 27th to 23rd place on the

all-time career scoring list. Lotz has

been perfect on kicks this year, con-
necting on all five field goal attempts
and seven extra—point attempts.

Turman needs just 34 passing
yards to pass Bob Bestwick and move
into 13th place on Pitt’s all-time list.
Turman has 1,890 career passing yards
heading into Saturday.

Latef Grim continues his march to

the No. 1 spot on both the receptions-

list and receiving yards list.

’ Thirteen receptions will push
Grim past Dietrich J ells into first place
on the receptions list, and he needs
seven receiving yards to move into

third place on that list, past Gordon‘

Jones. Second place is also in sight for
Grim, just 140 yards away. —

g Pitt and Rutgers will kickoff at
3:30 p.m. at Three Rivers Stadium.

crowd. Once again, Emey was the main

weapon, combining his running and pass- _

ing skills; The drive was capped off when
Rutgers receiver Randy Jackson got
behind Alonzo Hampton and Erney laid
in a ‘perfect 24-yard touchdown pass.

Pitt failed to score on its next posses-
sion, marking the first drive without any
points.

Rutgers did not follow suit, however,
and when James ‘Cann scored from 3
yards out, the Scarlet Knights’ had a 15-14
lead on the Panthers. , _ .

Not to be outdone, the Panthers

roared back and took the lead once again. . »

Richards scored on 1-yard touchdown
run then added the two point conversion.

Just three minutes later, Pitt extended _‘

its lead to 29-15. Once again, Richards
put the ball in the end zone on a 15-yard
reception. ’

. ‘The turningpoint was probably our
offense,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said.

“We controlled the all and got ahead by
two touchdowns.”

After an Ed Frazier ﬁeld goal put Pitt 1'

ahead 32-15 early in the second half,
Emey put Rutgers back in the game when
he scored from two yardsjout.

The game shifted back to Richards,
as he got the call on ﬁve of the ﬁrst six
offensive plays. Walker, _ however, fm-

-ished the drive with a two—yard touch- _

down run, giving Pitt a 39-22 lead.
Late in the game, Pitt put it out of
reach, 46:22, as freshman Jim Bundy got

. his first substantial nmning experience of -

the season. Bundy and walkercombined
for 54 yards rushing and Bundy scored
his first touchdown of the season from
one yard out to cap off the drive.  ,

Tom Tarver replaced Emey at quar-
terback_and threw the last TD of the day,
a 14-yard pass to Jim Guarantano.
