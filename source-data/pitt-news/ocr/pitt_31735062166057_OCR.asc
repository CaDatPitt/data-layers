Block ‘

A revamping of the‘Block “P" program for the remainder of the season has

been announced by Block chairman Sue Biddle.

Under the new arrangements the ﬂashcard section will perform during the
half-time ceremonies rather than the present program of isolated stunts throughout
the game. According to the committee a half-time show is performedxby all other

schools which sponsor aﬂashcard section. .

According to chairman Biddle, the new program offers "several improve-
ments. “First,” she said, “the new. idea presents an opportunity for the Block
to perform in a unified show. This uniﬁcation will be of special advantage dur-
ing the Penn State, Army and Notre Dame games.
plans to work in cooperation with the Homecoming and Band themes of nursery

. rhymes and Disneyland.

,“The attention of the fans can be ‘drawn to the card section at half time
when the game is not in progress,” Sue continued, “and the advantages to the mem-
_bers of the Block will be had through the convenience of not having to perform

the card stunts during the action of the game.”

For Homecoming Events

In a meeting last Thursday, Oct. 18, the fraternities and

Homecoming game with Army. Since the theme for Home-
coming is nursery rhymes this year, the participants had to

pick which particular rhyme’ each will use.

-‘New Look’ Offense

By ED KOLTISKA
With the “new look” in automobiles being ballyhooed
by new ‘car dealers, Panther fans will get their ﬁrst lot}:
at Coach John Michelosen’s “new look” this Saturday after-

noon at the Stadium, 6

The premier held at Norfolk,
Virginia, last Saturday afternoon
was a great success as the Blue
and Gold picked up their hunt-
ing lieense a week early to bag
Duke 27-14.

Taking a day off from practice
to watch the films of their last
tilt, the Oaklanders were given
extra instructions on Kentucky
windage in preparation for Ducks,
the Oregon Ducks.

Backﬁeld Light

The new look comprising of
Ralph Jelic at fullback, Corky
Cost and Jim Theodore at the
halfs, with Corny Salvaterra call-
ing signals is one of the lightest
taking the ﬁeld this season.

Jelic has been tipping the
scales at 185 pounds while Cost
and Theodore weight in at 169
and 180 pounds respectively.
Salvaterra, the heavest of the

1 group. pushes the arrow up to
the‘ 195-pound line. ‘

Although light, this quartet has
shown a lot of power and speed
as they rolled up 200‘ yards on 41

. carries for a 4.8 yard average.

_ Pass Defense Improves

The backﬁeld isn’t the only new
attraction to the Panther offense.
Coach Michelosen, long konwn

little hi-arc into his plays as the

In their last three games, the
passing department could only
account for a total of 115 yards.
The pass defense has also shown
considerable improvement as the
Oaklanders held the Blue Dexils
to no yards gained through the
air.

Even Sonny Jurgensen, Duke’s
All-American prospect, who pass-
ed the Blue Devils to victory over
SMU although playing only a
small part of a quarter, couldn’t
penetrate the Panther defense on
his two attempts.

Sophomores See Action

enabled such stalwarts as Joe

Gourmets Investigate
Italian Home Cooking

. By FITZHUGH SCHENLEY
l V (Editor’s Note: Fitzhugh Schenley, junior reporter from the

PITT NEWS assigned to the Oakland and Shadyside beat, crossed
town this week to South Hills where he attended the latest dinner
of\Gourmets Anonymous, Pitt’s rgew secret society devoted to
leisurely eating.)
, Administration, faculty and student members of Gour-
 mets Anonymous investigated Italian haute cuisine this week
in an effort by one of the student members to prove that his
favorite meal ranks with the best of French and American
cooking. V
E , Consensus of the GA Society was that he proved it.
2

s “Once more we have shown that’
> "i"”‘,f1mple things in cooking are
tha1.;3>est,” remarked the chairman,
«\ as he pushed back his chair afte
,. his third cafe expresso. -
' A Signora Pleased

N La Signora, the host’s mother,
‘ was jleased with the compliment.
R ;- The chairman hastened to add
‘ :1 that the “simple things” must have
i; taken the most of her day to pre-
pare.

The table was centered with two
i . large platters of antipasto, boun-
= tiful appetizers which precede
,3 the main courses of an Italian
meal. In addition to the greens and
 s 393’, the platters contained

' hovies, sardines and tuna for
‘the salty seafood." Provolone, a
sharp hard cheese, and mozzarella,
a bland goat’s milk cheese, made
a pleasing contrast to the capo-
collo, a highly-peppered smoked
pork, and the prosciutto, a smoked
ham, served paper-thin.

The main course was Linguini
Calamari, a tremendous serving
of ﬂat Italian noodles with stuff-
ed spid and calamari sauce.

The linguini was followed by
two vegetables. Melanzana alla
parmigiana was a casserole of egg
plant. The thin slices had been
dipped in an egg batter and then

 
  

sauteed lightly before being plac-
ed among alternate layers of
grated Parmesan cheese and to-
mato sauce in the baking dish.

Roman Style

Artichokes, done in the Roman
style, were then served. A ﬁne
olive oil was poured on this vege-
table, which contained a stufﬁng of
grated bread crumbs, parsley, gar-
lie and Parmesan cheese. Peperoni
arosto was served as a side dish.

The vegetable courses brought
the meal to- a ﬁtting climax.
Throughout the dinner, the guests
enjoyed a Chianti Melini, a bet-
ter-than—average Italian wine,
suitable for both the linguini and
vegetable courses.

A three—layer rum cake, con-
taining a light egg custard be-
tween the layers, was the sweet
desert. Cafe expresso was made
at the table and was accompan-
ied by a domestic California
brandy produced by Christian
Brothers.

Following the dinner, the guests
ordered the proper records kept,
thanked their hostess, informed
the press of the society's proceed-
ings, and voted to return as soon
as they could wangle another in-
vitation.

Bloclr .7" Change ‘

Block ‘P’ Committee members have revamped their pro-
gram _for the remainder of the football season to include a
presentation of stuntsonly at half time instead of during the
entire game. The Committee probably felt a need for such a
change after hearing unfavorable comments from Block ‘P’

.members during the Syracuse battle. The students complain-

ed particularly about having to perform stunts during plays
of the football game. At the same time, they were asked to
cooperate with the cheerleaders and band. The new plan
should\eliminate both disadvantages. Besides, the change

will enable a uniﬁed show to be presented. The stunts, run-

ning consecutively, will allow the card section to tell a story,

‘accompany the band formations being performed on the

ﬁeld, or accompany the announcements being made over the
Stadium’s P.A. system. With. such uniﬁed action, the new

plan should attract the attention of the stands more so than

when the stunts were ‘performed during the action in the

ﬁeld.

Block ‘P’ leaders are to be commended on their attempt

, to ﬁnd the best method of presentation of the ﬂash card sec-

tion. The leaders, however, have done all they can do. Now
it is up to the 1060 members of the organization. It will take

— of good food by knowing the care

‘ this knowledge it is not required

 
     

In Good, Taste ,. . .A

By Jim Merino

‘An appreciation of ﬁne food should be as im-
portant to a college student as an appreciation of
good music, literature or creative handcraft.

In any course on appreciation of the arts, a
student is told that there is a creative‘ listening,
viewing or reading. If an understanding of the
forms and the methods initiating an idea in various
arts can be helpful inreaching j  ‘ 
this appreciation, then a similar ’
study should be merited by the
creations of a worthy chef. 1

In other words, a student of
eating can better know the value

   

and inspiration that «was neces-
sary for its creation. To acquire

of the student that he cook, but H: .

a merely that he should be aware of the basic, phil-

osophy of creative cookery." _

A good chef or cook expresses himself in his
food. It is the diner’s duty to know what the idea
is. The menu is usually left to the diner. This is
his opportunity to communicate with the chef con-
cerning his ideas of ﬁne eating-.

Eating Education

A group of Pitt students and faculty have evi- ~“

dently become aware of these facts and have de-
cided to form‘ an organization devoted to an edu-
cation in eating. The general mien of this group
is an open-minded approach to any new ‘or un-
discovered idea of eating. ‘
According tp reports, the reason for their anony-
mity "is to protect’ the faculty and administration
fraters from unwanted publicity. Other than this
restriction,
Anyone who can show some’ knowledge of what

of the forms of this art a pleasant and easy matt ‘f,

there are.no rules on membership.“

Appetite ; J 

is acceptable fare is welcomed by the group.

A true acdaemic debate on food, as on any art
form, is permissable only on a basis of relative
worth, The question is not whether this steak is
good or bad, but whether it is better or worse.
To participate in such a debate, it is evident that
the viewpoints‘ must be backed by experience in
eating and an appreciation of the way in which
steak can be prepared.

It‘ is this experience and appreciation that the
student should strive for. ‘

‘Simplicity Shown

Simplicity is the ﬁrst quality of ﬁne cooking
that will strike a novice student. The uncompli-
cated recipes of truly great menus make the study

This doesn’t mean that there is not great vari

ty of invention in the preparation of food. A good

example is that of a recipe for artichokes.

To many people artichokers are pickled and
preserved like rhubarb. To a few who have taken
an interest in this ancient vegetable, the best way
to serve artichokes is according to the'Italian.
This preparation is interestingly named Carcioﬁ alla
romana. The recipe calls for steaming the vege-
tables. ' ‘ g

V The artichokes are then stuffed with a dry
mixture of very ﬁnely chopped parsley and garlic,
grated breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, salt and
pepper. They are then placed in a shallow pan
with ‘ﬁne olive oil.« The vegetables are allowed\ 0

bake slowlyiand are occasionally basted to preven 

drying.
The simplicity of this recipe demonstrates the

basic philosophy of ﬁne cooking. The joy of cook- ‘

ing is only half the value of the art. The other
joy is in the eating. '

Student Duty . . .

The Co,||e;gia’re

By Ed Bushman’

Hats off to the Very Reverend
Vernon F. Gallagher, president
of Duquesne University, who is
attempting a tremendously diﬂi-
cult project. His task, brought to
is to
make American college students
wake up to a prime responsibility
-—-that of exercising a main duty
of citizenship.

This duty is that of voting.

Father Gallagher has express-
ed considerable disgust with the
results of a nation-wide poll re-
cently conducted through our
colleges and universities. This
poll shows that of every ﬁve
men and women of voting age

now attending college, only two’

are registered and intend to-vote
in the presidential election on
Nov. 6. ‘

In an attempt to discover the
University‘ of Pittsburgh’s ratio
on election interest, approxi-

M mately 300 students of voting

age were asked during the, past
week if they were registered’ and
intended to vote. The results

._are as follows:

Registered Unregistered
47% 53%
Pitt, then, rates about seven
percent above the average col-
lege: throughout the nation in
voting interest, but it certainly
is not a ﬁgure of which we can

‘be proud. In fact it is very pa-

thetic for a university which
hopes to become one of the
world’s foremost in every ﬁeld.

‘What Can Be Done?

What then can we the college
students and so-called future
leaders, do about this pathetic
lack of interest? One thing,‘ of
course, is for each eligible per-
son to register and vote in each
general and local election. But
much more must be done in an
effort to build national interest.
Some suggestions are as folloys:

Recquire in all high schools
throughout the nation. a regular
unbiased program of educating
students on such things as voting
procedure and information on all
candidates;

” Investigate, the possibility of
lowering the voting age from
the present 21 years of age re-
quirement in most states so as

«to make use of interest high

ins

 

school students may obtain by

programs such as that outlined
above;

Make an atttempt to strength-
en the two-party system in such
areas as the South and New
England where one .particular
party dominates so extensively;
and _
Abolish the Electoral College
system so as to make the indi-
vidual vote count more.

This is only a bare list of
many ideas to strengthen politi-
cal interest. There are many oth-
er ideas, but the main thing is
that a strong interest must be
shown, and shown by many more

people if we are to get national 

and local governments who will
serve the interests of all the
people and not just a bare_per-
centage of them. 

Dwight D. Eisenhower recent-
ly made a statement which car-
ried much sense. This was when
he said his main goal is to get a
great majority to the polls on
Nov. 6. The President said, “I
would rather lose the election
under that circumstance than
win it with only a handful of
people voting.” Only by a great
majority of people voting can we
truly have a “Government of
the People, by the People, and
for the People.”

Letters to the Editoivl

Editor, The Pitt News:

Several articles have appeared
in recent issues of the Pitt News
in re the appeal of Pi Lambda
Phi to the Interfraternity Judici-
ary Commission. The articles
were most one—sided. Pitt News
failed to contact any member of
*Pi Lambda Phi to ascertain what
the position of the fraternity is
on the matter in question. "

The latest article used as its
only reference a copy of a letter
sent to me, as president of the
fraternity, from the Commission,
which presented only the stand-
point of the members of the
judiciary group on our conten-
tion and their decision. More-
over, our fraternity feels that
the mention made of the indi-
vidual involved was unnecessary
and, furthermore, in “bad taste.

We reafﬁrm our support of the
Judicial Commission. We feel
that the establishment of the
Commission is a ﬁrst step toward
self-regulation by the student
body. As a matter of record, I
was a member of the group of
three from the executive com-
mittee of the Interfraternity
Council, who advocated the es-
tablishment’ of the Judiciary
Commission. ‘ -

It is evident and somewhat
understandable to us that . the
members of the Commission, in
an effort to establish themselves
as a judiciary body, have been
a bit overzealous. We hopethat,

as the Judiciary Commission be-
comes an accepted group on the
campus, the Pitt News will pro-
vide a more objective analysis
of the cases on both sides of an
argument. N
Hopefully,
Larry Miller, President

George Connelly, V

By JAY BUTLER

Almost hidden in the base-
ment of the Cathedral of
Learning is one of the most in-
teresting characters at Pitt.
Asked for his story. His an-
swer was, “C’mon kid, forget

it. I got personal reasons.”

George Connelly didn’t want
this story written about him. He
seemed slightly afraid of saying
something wrong, pf failing to re-
main just a little man in the base-
ment. As he argued, a nervous
sweat began to collect behind his
glasseas, and his lips seemed to
shake a little as he talked. Final-
ly he gave in “Okay kid, you ask
the questions and I’ll answer the
ones that I can.”

George’s connection with Pitt
started 33 years ago when he
answered a want-ad for a mess-
enger boy. He is now known offi-
cially as shipper, receiver, and
truck foreman. There has been a
lot of rich experience in between.

George makes allusions to a girl
friend, but you can’t pin him
down on that. He says the foot-
ball team is his ﬁrst love.

“Those guys could be ,;,unde-
feated if they’d get out there and
play ball. They just don’t put
out.” Before football it was the
basketball team. “When Doc Carl-
son retired, I did. I sat on that
bench for thirty years.”

Connelly holds an honorary
letter from the athletic depart-
ment and remembers a lot of
great teams of the past. While

 Ducks Need Win

 

ver Panthers

By AL PELAEZ

Len - Casanova’s O r e g o n

 17 squad will get their feet back

on the ground this Saturday

when they meet the Panthers

in Pitt Stadium-—neverthe-

a less," they don’t appear too

happy_about the situation.

Last week the Webfoots used
everything but butterfly nets in
an- attempt to halt Stanford’s

 3 John Brodi -—- the nation’s lead-

ing passer -- but still bowed 21-
7, with Brodi completing over
half of his passes. The Panthers,
on the other hand, are primarily
a running team and use the air-
lanes only as a last resort.

Casanova, who guided the ~-
Panthers during the 1942 sea-
son, needs a good performance
against the highly ranked Oak-
landers to regain the good graces
of the Oregon fans. Personable
Len, who just three years ago
was presented a plaque which
read, “Having given us victory
by reestablishing an undying
Oregon spirit, you have won the
respect and admiration of your
team and the entire Oregon
was both hung and
burned in efﬁgy on the Duck’s
campus this week.

The Webfoots ended last season
as the hottest team on the West

A , Coast with ﬁve wins in their last

six games. This year they had
high hopes of going to the Rose
Bowl, but three straight losses to
conference opponents have ended
this dream. After beating Colo-
rado 35-0 and Idaho 21-14, the
Dukes fell apart. UCLA shut them

i ﬂ out 6-0 and Washington rolled to

a 20-7 victory the week before
Stanford -—- and Brodi -— flew to
a 21-7 decision.

Duck’s Top Ground Gainer

HB Theodore Surprises
With PlayDesp ite Size

By MIKE KOSCHIK
Undoubtedly the biggest surprise of the season for Coach
John Michelosen has been the performance of halfback Jim

Theodore of Wilmerding. The junior scatback is one of
the most improved players on the team. As a sophomore,

tries while playing just 30 min-
utes in the ten games.

Jim began this season as a third
string halfback, but was so im-
pressive in the first two games
that he was moved up to the ﬁrst
team. Theodore now leads all
Panther backs in ground gain-
ing with 157 yards in 28 trys for
a 5.6 average. '

In the West Virginia game,
while still on the third team,
Jim played only a few minutes,
but intercepted a pass on the
last play of the game. 3

In the Sqracuse game, Theodore
did not start, but when he enter-
ed the game late in the ﬁrst half,
it was'Jim’s play that enabled
the Panthers to tie the game at
7-7. The Wilmerding flash gained

42 yards the first three times he

Shanley takes a handoff from
quarterback Tom Crabtree and
starts to roll. Last year Shan-
ley topped the PCC with the
highest number of yards ever
gained by a sophomore-—7ll for
a 7.1 average per try.

OO‘O

Oregon’s offense -—- labled one
of the best in the Far West-has
been held to two touchdowns in
the three straight losses. One of
the main causes of this offensive
slump has been an epedemic of
fumbleitis on the part of the Duck
backs. The fact that they can
move the ball" has already been
established —- if they stop losing
it via/ costly fumbles they can
make the afternoon a long one
for the Blue and Gold.

Leading the powerful Oregon
ground attack is fullback Ja-ck
Morris who has rambled for 266
yards in the Duck’s' ﬁrst four
games. _Morris, who runs the
hundred in 9.7, was the nation’s
tenth highest scorer last year as
a sophomore.

Jim Shanley and reserve full-
back Fred Miklancic. Shanley, a
diminutive junior, gained 711
yards last season to set a Paciﬁc
Coast Conference record for a

ing nearly seven yards a carry
this year.

Coach Casanova knows that his
offense is "much better than it has
appeared in the last three games.
He thinks that the Ducks can
score against the much bigger
Panthers often enough to win.
“Now if our defense can only
handle them. . . .’¢ He stopped and
smiled —- a big “it” but still a
possibility.

Against Tough

Harriers After Fifth Straight

OSU Buckeyes”

By MICHAEL ‘GERBER ,

On Saturday, at Columbus, Ohio, Carl Olson’s harriers
go after their ﬁfth straight win as they take on the much
improved Ohio State Buckeyes. To date, the Panthers are
undefeated, having beaten Westminster, Slippery Rock, Navy

and Villanova
meet, and Georgetown.

Following Saturday’s engage-
ment in Columbus, the Panthers
will take on Army and Penn State
at home on successive Saturdays.

Ohio State is reported to have
*its best cross-country team in
many years. The team is ex-
perienced, and the fact that the
meet will be run over a short,
ﬂat course, will be to the advan-
tage of the Buckeyes.

In John Blackburn, Ohio State
has a top ﬂight harrier. Black-
burn, a junior, is one of_ the best
two milers in the United States,
and is equally good on the hills
and dales. '

However, Blackburn will not
pose the only problem for the
Blue and Gold. Senior Lloyd Bar-
tel and junior John McClain also
know their way around a cross-

in a triangular:

country»-course, and have a habit
of ﬁnishing early.

George Jones, Dave Youmans,
and Bill Latshaw back up the
top three, and these are in turn
supported by sophomores Jim
Trueman, Bob Weadick, and Le-
land Zilles.

Coach Olson’s Panthers will be
led by sophomore sensation Vin-
nie Timon, who will be assisted
by such consistent runners as
Thornton Smith, John Christof,
and Jimmy Moore, and also press-
ed by Dale Fauser, Wendell Har-
ford, and Tom Jessup. .

All in all, the Blue and Gold
appear to be too strong for the
improved Buckeyes. The Bucks
also own some top ﬂight runners,
but probably not enough of them
to cope with Timon and his deep
and experienced supporting cast.

Theodore gained 16 yards in foui¢

    

carried the ball. and picked up
30 of the 39 yards as the Panthers
drove to their ﬁrst score. In all,
Jim ran the ball 11 times and
gained 91 yards to lead the
ground gainers for the afternoon.

When the team traveled to
California, Theodore ﬁnally got
a chance to start, and showed
himself creditably as he was the
second leading ground gainer with
37 yards in six attempts. He also
had‘a long gain nulliﬁed by a

Theodore Jim much pub-
licity, and the Duke team was
waiting for him. As a result he
was held to 29_ yards in 11 carries.

Coach Michelosen is naturally
pleased with his play. “He is pro-
bably our best breakaway run-
ner and although he is small, he
manages to take advantage of his
blocking and ﬁght for those extra
yards. His size (5-10, 175) hind-
ers him in some respects but he’s
a ﬁghter all the way,’l says
Michelosen.

Jim wants to be a doctor and
is a straight A student in Pre-
Med. His brother, Mike, was a
basketball star at Carnegie Tech
a few years back, and still
coaches their freshman basket-

 Midshipmen Present
Booters with Hurdle

By MURRAY A. CHASS

'7
,

Coach Leo Bemis is hoping

that the potential power that

his soccer proteges have will blossom into kinetic use on
Saturday, at Annapolis, against the Naval Academy squad.

To be sure, the local booters must do just that if they
Wish to climb back aboard the winning trail and bring their
1-2-1 record up to an even .500.

Navy tutor Glenn Warner has$

put together as strong, if not
stronger, a team this year as he
produced in 1955 when the Mid-

(dies compiled a creditable mark

of seven wins, three losses, and
one stalemate.

And among those seven victims

    

 

L11nSnr.iu::ou1

was the Oakland team, 4-1.

This season the future Ensigns
have had three games and all
three were shutouts. In their first
two meets, they knocked off
Brooklyn College,’ 6-0, and Prince-
ton, 2-0; against Yale, though,
they found, themselves on the
white—wash end, 1-0.

The Midshipmen, like a good
baseball team, are strongest up
the middle. The goal tender,
who has given up but one score
in the three tussles, Hugo Marx-
er; the captain and center half
of the team, Jim O’Connell; and
the center forward, Chuck Har-
low, combine to give their pop-.
ponents 88 minutes of fast, hard
play.

Besides Navy’s noted power,
Panther strategist Bemis is most

       

concerned with the top condition
of this Saturday’s hosts. “We will
not face another team this year
that will be in as good condition
as they will be. It is going to take

a lot of extra hustle on our part
to match their speed and con-
tinuous drive,” says Bemis.

Midshipmen Tilt Crucial

The season thus far resembles
'ery closely that which the Pan-
thers experienced in 1955. After
capturing their f.~:,t twogames,
they were rudily jolted by Duke
and North Carolina State. In fact,
these setbacks came just one
week earlier than the duo loss
.hey suffered last week.

And which team did they
come up against in their bid to
get back in the victory column?
That’s correct — Navy. But as
was stated previously, the Pan-
thers did not beat the Middies.
However, they went on from.
there to take six straight and
ﬁnish with a .667 slate.

On Saturday Bemis will go with
much the same lineup that start-
ed in last week’s meets. Paul
Grifl'iths, center fullback, who
had to be taken out in the third
quarter at Brockport State when
the ball slid off his foot and hit
him in the eye, is all set to roll.

Jack Hill, who had been hurt
in a scrimmage prior to the Grove
City meet, played in both. games
and "will also be at full strength
for Saturday. Jack Horox, a re-
cent addition * to the starting
eleven, and Al Solomon, the new
right fullback, will undoubtedly
see plenty of action, too.

 

“I've tried ’em all. It’s Camels for me. They -taste just right
and they’re real easy to get along with, p

Panther Yearlings Battle Navygi

Shallow Bench Hampers Team

By CHRIS

‘ Coach Steve Petro isn’t the type to say “I told you so,”
but if he were, this» would be the week he could do it.

When the freshmen first started practice, Petro warned

that besides an overall smallness in size, the squad was

GILLOTTI

also lacking in numbers. Most of$

the student body passed this off
as normal put—on pessimism
found in inost grid coaches, and
some went so far as to publicly
condemn him.

Saturday, unfortunately. Petro
was proved correct. A weak
bench, coupled

 

injuries, pre-
v e n t e d t h e
opening up of
the Penn State
defensive line
and ultimately
a 7-0 defeat
for the Panther
Cubs.

e t r 0 isn’t _
complainingl ~
however. “I Sepsi
expected this to happen,” admits
Petro. “In fact I was pleased that
the boys did as well as they did.
I was impressed by our guards,
Al Corﬁeld, Bob Longfellow, and
Nort Seaman,. and Dave Helsel
who played 60 minutes at end.

“Our backﬁeld looked good,
especially Andy Sepsi, Ivan Ton,

Bob Rathi had to fill in at end,
and a tackle, Chuck Marranca
had to play center,” added Petro.
Pass offense was the weak point
in any Panther drive, Petro feels.
“The passes were there, but be-
cause of feeble blocking, the re-
ceivers were either not there, 0
covered,” said Petro. a

Meet Navy Next

The Yearlings travel to Anna-
polis, Saturday, to take on the
Navy Plebes in hopes of capturing
their first win of the season.

The Midshipmen were defeated
by the Penn State frosh, but have
a big strong squad and have been
practicing since August. The
Panther Cubs will be out to im-
prove on the 13-13 tie that re-
sulted last season.

OKAY TOUGH GUYS

Coach Rex Peery requests
that all students interested in
‘wrestling to contact him at the
_ Field House immediately. Plen-
ty of positions are open in the

Young mathematician

Recently General Electric developed a
compact, new motor ior industrial use. But
before the motor could be put into automatic
production, one difficulty remained: to de-
sign a protective end shield that would con-

ﬁne any possible explosion to the motor itself. _

The man who solved the tough mathemat-
ical problems involved is R. A. “Pete” Powell
-—- a mathematical analyst whose job is to as-
sist other engineers in math problems which
arise in any number of different projects.

Powell's Work is Varied and Important

Because he is not tied down to any one
project, Powell seldom has two similar as-

~ signments. Taking established engineering
_ and mathematical principles, some of them

extremely complicated, Powell applies them
to advanced engineering problems. In doing
this, Pete is able to make such calculations
as the distortion of a‘ small part of a jet
engine caused by vibrations, the deflection
occurring in a turbine part when it runs at
operational speeds, or the forces exerted
upon a rotating shaft by lubricants.

27,000 college Graduates at General Electric’

When “Pete” Powell came to General Elec-
tric in 1953, he already knew the kind of
work he wanted to do. Like each of our
27,000 college-graduate employees, he is
being given the. chance to grow and realize
his full potential. For General Electric has
long believed this: Whenever.fresh young
minds are given freedom to make progress,
everybody beneﬁts —— the individual, the
Company, and the country.

study in Physics again at Purdue.
