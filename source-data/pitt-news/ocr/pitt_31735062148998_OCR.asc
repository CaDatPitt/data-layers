‘ Winners of each council’s

Rotating Trophies

For this and other activities
such as Greek Sing, and other

awarded and displayed in the vic-
tor’s Dean of Men’s office.

“Eventually,” stated 0’Malley,
“we hope to merge the talent
and resources of all member

cils for social events.” ’

A motion to grant equal repre-
sentation in IFC to all member
fraternities failed to receive a
necessary two-thirds majority
vote. At present, voting power of
member fraternities is relegated
according to number strength.

Unique Representation

Speaking for the motion, Vice
President, ~Denis Lichtman, Col.
’59, declared, “It seems ironical

eastern region not requiring equal
representation. I, along with the
executive committee, believe Pitt
not to be uniquely right, but
rather out of line with the other
eastern councils.”

nounced that IFC and Pan-

These studies enable him to ac-

Police Promise
Leniency For

Those Tagged

There is some hope left for
students whose autos were
tagged for violation of the
“No Parking” signs Monday.
‘ The signs ‘were put up on
Belleﬁeld and Dithridge Sts.

Sunday to reserve parking for
military men attending the Natur-
al Resources Conference at Mel-
lon Institute. The signs will re-
main up until theend of the con-
ference, Nov. 22.

When the administrative as-
sistants of the conference read
about the situation in Wednes-
day’s PITT NEWS, they were
caught off guard. a
They expressed their regret
about the situation and told the.
News that they would request
Supt. James Slusser of the Pitts-
burgh Police, and also a conferee
as Lt. C01. in the Army to obtain
leniency for those who received

the tags. ' "

Thursday afternoon Slusser,

said that he would contact the
Magistrates of Pittsburgh Traf-,
ﬁc Court, who handle the dispo-
sition of the traffic tags, and ask
them to be lenient. He said that
he would do whatever was in
his power to ease the situation. I
At the same’ time Inspector
Martin of the Tralﬁc Division gave
some ease to the problem by say-
ing that parking is permitted from
4 p.m. until 8 a.m. I _ N H

BUTTON-DOINN .WINSOCK|!

College students love shirts

with button-down collars, but '

we’ve never known exactly
why. So Van Heusen’s research
department asked around and
got the following answers.

L.B. Senior at Mass. Insti-
tute of Entomology. “The but-
tons keep things from crawling
under your collar. Or, if things
do crawl under your collar,
the buttons prevent them from
crawling out again'.’’

’ D2.D.E. Freshman at Hora-
tio Alger Tech. “You get more
buttons so I ﬁgure the shirt is
more valuable. Is it?”

B.P. Junior at the Pate
School of Tonsorial Arts.
“They're cooler! Wisps of air
blow through the little hole
in the button and keep my
clavicle_at a refreshing tem-
perature. -

shirts I can wear one side but-
toned and the other side un-
buttoned, thereby giving the
effect of wearing two types of
shirt at one time. Oh help me,
help me!” I
Z.J.‘ Graduate student at
the T.S. Swinburne School of
A Beautiful Experiences. “But-
tons remindme of pearls. Pearls ‘
remind me of oysters. Oysters
remind me of indigestion. Indi-
gestion reminds me,of my doc- I
tor. My doctor reminds me of
his nurse. She’s gorgeous. Gor-
geous! So the more buttons
the better.” ’
Yes, there’s agreement that
button-downi collars are the
thing. And there's further,
agreement that Van Heusen
is the king of Button-down
stylists. Just take a look at
Van Heusen Oxfordians next
time you’re in the market for

why they’re famous. $5.00.

One of the basic changes in our age has oc-
curred in the area of office systems. The IBM Co.,
Remington—Rand, and the Samas Division of the
Underwood Corporation produce machines which
tabulate by the “punched-card method.”

Using individual facts concerning records, which
are punched on heavy-paper cards, the equipment
combines and organizes facts to
prepare various types of recordsf
reports, and documents.

The punched—card system is
designedeto perform statistical or 3
accounting work quickly and
accurately by machine methods.
The ﬁrm of A. David Adler,

one which employs machines to
perform nearly all the account-
ing work.

Above the hum and click-
clack ‘of the tabulators, I was informed on a visit
that a time—study was being conducted on the in-
dividual employee’s division of time_ on each ac-
count.

Later the same day, an accounting machine was
attached to a summary punch by cable and per-
formed the usually laborious task of tabulating a
complete monthly account.

An inserted control panel in the machine con-
tains a maze of electrical connections which are
the conductors of impulses within the tabulators
indicating what operations are‘necessary. The in-

formation for the particular month is fed on cards,
punched beforehand. This is the last hand opera-
tion and the original punched cards are verified
on a machine appropriately called a veriﬁer.

Another‘ machine in this oﬁ‘ice is the collator
whose job it is, after the other operations have
been completed, to ﬁle, check sequence, select
speciﬁc numbers or ranges of numbers from an un-
sorted group of cards, or to compare two_ sets of
cards, pairing those that contain ident.ical punches
in ﬁelds compared and rejecting ithers.

IBM Used ~

This particular system is an IBM (electrical
type). Time magazine employs IBM systems and
Reader’s Digest utilizes a mechanical system, Uni-
vac, the computer which decided the election in
Eisenhower’s favor in 1952 from the first few re?-'
turns, is familiar to most students.

A system is only valuable to anofﬁce when the
system may be used enough to warrant the rental.
The complete plan of attack (flow chart) including
all machine and hand operations is drawn up be-
forehand. This program may be revised as the

situation dictates.

A punched card.is the unit record. These are
classiﬁed in systematic groupings and arithmetical '
computations may be performed from the facts.
These include adding, subtracting, and crossfooting.

The punched—card system is obtaining accept-
ance on all fronts. Our University and its comput-
ing center bear testimony to this fact. Punched-
card systems have revolutionized oﬁice and statis-
tical work.

 ' Possibly no students in the nation have such a con-
: . ' centrated and constant attention paid to their physical well-
 being as those of this University.‘ K

J‘: ' Certainly there is. nothing lacking in the breadth of the
 Health Program at Pitt. The plan had been one of well-
i:-_ Jestablished procedure and organization. Everything from
appointments. to injections has been handled with a perfect
example of efficiency and forethought.

But this fall two glaring mistakes have been made.
These errors were committeed by those same groups who
made the earlier programs an examplary success.

The program was organized last spring along the lines
of cooperation between all portions of the Pitt family. Ad-
ministration, faculty, students, employees and their de-
pendents beneﬁtted from the plan and were asked to work
for ‘its completion.

9-. 4 This request was more than answered by hundreds of
 badly-needed Volunteers. |
However, the sa_me program this year is still lacking
200 workers for the proper administration of innoculations
and , X-rays.
Since the program depends on cooperation ofthe entire
Pitt family, the failure of the volunteer system in this case
must be’ caused by a failure of some area of the University
to respond to the request.
It is apparent that this lack of response lies with the
s students. There are workers from all other areas of Pitt but
few from among the student body.
Not all the blame for this reaction is to be placed by any
means on the students. Such judgment and condemnation
j would be preliminary and superﬁcial.
3 h The lack of student response is probably attributable
to the fact that the chief organizers of the ‘program did not
V provide for student participation in the planning stage this
5 A ‘ Semester as they did in the spring.

But even here there are reasons. It would not be’ feasi-
ble'to expect a good percentage of the student body to be
able,to handle the opening of a new semester, ‘Homecoming,
and other activities and still aid in the preparation of the
program.

So the student body resultingly made little effort to
aid in the administration of the program.

All these facts taken into consideration, the Health

- Campaign still needs 200 workers urgently. If there are
students who‘can afford three hours their help is needed.

 BUSINESS MANAGER  FRED sAi_u;1N-

   

 

By Joseph Unger

Russia’s earth satellites have
had -a great impact on world af-
fairs. One of their major ac-
complishments has been to make
Americans aware of the lack of
science courses  . H 
offered in our  
public schools.
This they have
done by focus- A
ing attention on
fundame n t a l
Soviet educa-
tion. And the
natural c om-  '_
parisons point “
out our deﬁci-'
ency.

For instance, all Russian stu-
dents are introduced to biology
in, grade 4, to physics, algebra,
and geometry in grade 6; to
chemistry in grade 7; and to
astronomy and calculus in‘ grade
10. Students graduating from the
tenth grade have, completed ﬁve
years of physics, four years of
chemistry, and ﬁve years of
mathematics above the arith-
metic level.

This is in sharp contrast to
our system where science in the

elementary grades is almost un- -

heard of, and where 53% of the
high schools teach absolutely no
chemistry or physics. Subsequ-
ently, since Russia’s advances

 

-Not Just Competition . . .

ucatlon And The Nation ‘ ‘

are, largely, credited to her fun-
damental emphasis on science,‘
our deﬁciencies seem forebod-
ing.

It is very probable, however,
that the American people, now
realizing the eventual adverse
effect of our present scholastic
system, will call for and get an
educational change. Such a
change will give rise to basic
problems. For as surely as our
primary and secondary school
curricula must be expanded, it
must be expanded with a great
deal of insight.

We cannot let Russia’s satel-
lites, be the sole influence in
such an expansion. In other
words, we should not forget
that competition with a potential
enemy is a contemporary side-
light of education and not the
purpose of education. Therefore,

a way must be found to inte-

grate the sorely-needed science
courses into a required curricula
which remains both balanced
and generalized.

Such a balanced curricula,
composed substantially of bio-
logy, chemistry, physics, and
math courses, ‘would serve a

dual purpose.‘ First of all, it‘

would, indirectly, help to de-
crease our impending shortage
of scientists.

Suppose, for example, that a

young student possesses a hid-
den, undeﬁned leaning toward
experimental lab work. Upon
exposure to the basic lab met-
hods in various ﬁelds he could
discover his tendencies and.
eventually decide to become a
chemist or a biologist: Without
the chance to take enough basic
courses this same student can,
and often does, stumble toward
some unsuited occupation.

Certainly, this is not to say
that only science courses are
capable of teaching logical
thought. Nor is it to say that
every individual must be form‘
ally taught how to think. These
contentions would be foolhardy.

The point to be made is that .
an expanded, but not highly
technical, science program in
our public schools would give
many students a foundation in
logic at a time when their com-
plimentary courses are not al-
ways constructed to do so. And
this acquired logic could then
be applied to everyday problems.

Thus there is little doubt that
our fundamental educational
curricula need revision. But, it
must be a revision which will
insure us not only of enough
scientists, but also of a capable,
intelligent population at all age
levels.

~ ” Letters To The

Editor, The. Pitt News:

In the last issue of the “Pitt
News” you included an article
concerning Muttnik. Miss Stas-
enko dealt satirically with the
wave of concern over the_ fate
of Mut-tnik’s_ canine passenger.
However, Miss Stasenko’s con-
tribution to the controversy con-
cerning the use of animals in
scientiﬁc experiments was a
contribution to an already won
battle.

Yet, the basic question has
been ignored. The reasons given
for the Russian success in satel-
lite produc-tion by Pittstudents
has been as varied as it is fanci-
ful. Among the various explana-
tions can be found: “The Ger-
mans did it for them.” “It has
only propaganda value.” Why
worry about it?” “We could have
had it, but . . .”

One of the more common re-
actions is that: “Sure they have
it, but don’t worry. After all,
we are still the more moral na-
tion, and morality will triumph

‘in the end.” May I be permitted
to remark that the nations of

” Asia are_only attempting to re- .

  

cover today from the folly of
such thinking. Chinese scholar-
officials were busy assuring each
other that their civilization was
still spiritually superior to the
West at a time when the West-
ern nations were dividing, China
into spheres of influence.

Some students place the blame
wholly upon the dismal lack of
coordination between the Amer-
ican Armed Forces. They fail to
realize that the creation of new
subdivisions within the bureau-
cracy, or even the appointment
of a “Scientiﬁc Czar” ,will not
solve the basic problem.

A clue to the nature of the

underlying problem was con-

tained in an advertisement on
the page opposite to Miss Stas-
enko’s article. This representa-
tive piece of American scientiﬁc
direction advises engineers in
large letters: “Don’t Stick Your
Neck Out.” The ad goes on to
declare: “Your future depends
upon permanent security.” Such
thinking may well produce a so-
ciety of technicians, but it does
not produce creative scientists.

.574 1

The problem, which is being so

 

Editor

effectively ignored on this cam-
pus, isthat the United States is
now reaping the results of the
neglect of pure science. Today
there are only two corporations
in the country which encourage
pure science—General Electric
and Bell Telephone. The situa-
tion is such today that most uni-
versities has prostituted pure
science to theinterests of grants
from the government or corpor-
ations for applied science. Yeti
Muttnik again proves that what
appears to be the most imprac-
tical is often the most practical

~ in the last analysis.

This is the question to which
the attention of thinking people
at the university should be di-
rected. The controversy over the
use of animals in scientific ex-
periments was won long ago.
The fact that there has been
little controversy over the Amer-
ican approach to science is
tragic. It will be even more
tragic if such a controversy does
not commence.

On National Re sources

The 1957-58 National Resources Conference is being held
at Mellon Institute Nov. 10-22 by the industrial College of the

Armed Forces.

The conference is designed to foster an understanding of
problems related with national security and the nature of
the responsibilities of both the Military and the civilians in

national security.

It will discuss the various fac-
tors which play a part in the se-
curity of the nation and its abil-
ity to live in the age of the Sput-
nik.

Communism Discussed

Topics ranging from Soviet
Communism and the European
Satellites and Soviet Bloc Poten-
tial to
Resources are being discussed.

Over 150 civilian and high
military personnel are attending
the Conference. The military
personnel include both Regu-
lar and Reserve officers. Civil-
ians are from all areas of life
from industry to women’s or-
ganizations.

The’ conference is one of 16
similar conferences held each year
by the College. It is sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Chamber of Com-
merce.

Educational Purpose
The purpose of the conference is
educational and it is designed to
expand the number of informed
persons who may be called upon
to play important roles in national
defense.
It is dedicated to achieving
better harmony between civil-

ians and military involved in
national defense.
Over thirty sessions will be

held in the ten day period deal-
ing with the various factors in na-
tional security. The sessions take

Of Parking Rules

Inspector Martin, of the Pitts-

warned students to obey parking
meter regulations.

The ‘police will tag and tow
away any car which stays in a
metered —zone past the time limit
of one or two hours even if addi-
tional money is put into the
meter. -

The meters on Forbes St.,

Fifth Ave., and certain side
streets around the University
are designed for turnover’ of
parking in the Oakland business
area.

The police “tag and tow” orders
were stimulated by complaints
from Oakland businessmen whose
customers use these parking
spaces.

Panthers Slide ByCadefs, 1-O“

 

Booters Notch Seventh
With ThirdPeriod Goal

Tom Young’s third period goal and Ron Goga’s brilliant
goal-keeping enabled the Panther Booters to upset the fast,
Well-coordinated Cadets last Saturday morning at West Point.

This marked Gogas sixth shut-out of the season and the
Blue and Golds fourth 1-0 victory. Previous 1-0 tilts came

at home with Grove City, Slippery Rock, and Brockport.

The shut-out lowered Goga’s¢

goals allowed per game to a low

0.75. The Panther netminder has.

had only one bad game in the
nets, and that against the fast
Navy eleven.

. Pestich Misses

The Cadets pressed the Panther
defense from the opening whistle
to the end of the game. The vet-
eran line for Coach John Kress
ha_d- many close shots only to be

[repelled by the tight\defense of

the Blue and,Gold. John Morrison,
Bob Puff, and Les Gibbings of
the Cadets had some close in
shots, but the defense was equal
to t e task.

he Bemismen were not to be
outdone as they too had many
close shots. Simeon Pestich had

a pair of close ones, one just go-

ing wide. Sam Hazou had one

slip off his toe just as he was
ready to shoot.

“Then late in the third period
the Panthers were pressing their
advantage when a freak goal was
scored. Young, playing center-for-
ward, carried the ball deep into
the Cadet’s territory and passed it
in front of the goal.

Long Injured
It was intercepted by one of the

Army fullbacks, who turned to

pass it back to his goalie Fred
Manzo, to be cleared. Manzo had
moved to the right to cover Hazou
and the pass-back rolled into the
goal. Young was then given credit

for the goal.

The joy of victory was damp-
ened by the fact that Bob Long,
plucky halfback,
broken left leg. It occurred with
15 minutes to play when he and
Ray Baugh scufﬂed for the ball.
All Long’s weight was on the
left leg and Baugh’s ‘kick slipped
off the ball and hit Long's leg.
Other small bruises and cuts
were sustained, but nothing
serious.

The defense of Dick Kipp, who
is still recovering from the effects
of a sprained ankle, Bill Eisinger,
,Ron Podmilsek, and Goga came in
‘for much praise for their ﬁne
workpin containing the fast Army
forward line.

Last Tuesday the Panthers
played their ﬁnal home game
when they beat the Slippery Rock
Rockets 1-0 on Jerry Bréssane1li’s
goal in the third period. It was
the ﬁrst loss for the Rockets, who
came into the game with a 5-0
record.

The Rockets got a chance to tie
the game when the Panthers were
penalized for illegal use of hands
with just two minutes remaining.
Ed‘Jarvie booted the ball toward
Goga, who knocked it to .the
ground and.grabbed it as ‘it was
rolling for the corner of the goal.
The Panthers then ran out the

clock.

Student Support  
Hits Rock Bottom

By ED KOLTISKA

Sports Editor

 

It seems as if every place you go, you can‘t help but hear some
comment about the poor showing of the Panther football team. But
one thing that no one ever mentionsvis the poor student support given
at these occasions. This statement takes into consideration attendance
as well as cheering support.

After ‘the Oklahoma opener, everyone connected with the
athletic department was criticized for not having enough seating
space available for the student body. But in the remainder of the
home games to date, empty seats plagued the student seetion-——in-
eluding Block P. ‘

Later, quite a few critical remarks were made as to whether or
not Big Time Football was good for Pitt. Whether or not it would be

.better for the Panthers to start playing some smaller colleges with

hopes of increasing student attendance by creating a campus at-
mosphere. ’

These remarks were easily answered by the students themselves
through their small attendance at the rest of the games. It seems
as if the only way to guarantee top student attendance is to bring in,
top teams like Oklahoma. \Vin or lose, Captain Tom Hamilton con-
tinues to schedule this type of keen competition. The question then
arises: Do the students deserve this type of schedule?

It is very discouraging to see cheerleaders down on the field going
through their routines only to get a feeble response by the student
section that can’t even be heard by the players on the bench. During
the high school band day at the stadium, the individual bands out-
cheered the whole Pitt student body. Where is this enthusiasm in
college?

VVhy then, should the players put forth all their energy to play
hard and win for their university when the student body could
care less? A team is only as good as the players that comprise it
and the players are only as good as the students want them to be.

Following is a poem sent in by a student on the present situation.
It is being published for the meaning and not for literary value.

But farther still went loyal fans, for gone were the bowl bid

They’re not cheered on and on to score, but are observed in
silence.

The boys have yet to hear a cheer when Pitt’s fallen at the half,
The mighty spirit fans deign to show is enough to makke one
laugh. i /

Gymnasts Start
Rigorous Drills.

Coach Warren Neiger’s
gymnasts are busily prepar-
ing for their upcoming sea-
son. Their training program
includes daily practices from

Thursday evening session in the
Field House proper.

“The Blue and Gold will prob-
ably rank second or third in the
Eastern Gymnastic League,” pre-
dicted Coach Neigcr. He is of the
opinion that Penn State is in a
class by themselves with the
Panthers, Army, and Navy battl-
ing it out for second.

Neizer is starting his sixth
year as the head of the gym-
nastic department. Ile came to
Skyscraper U. with a vast know-
ledge of the sport since he learn-
ed the basic fur.dament:>«"s from
Penn State‘s former Olympic
Coach, Gene Wettstcne-

A ﬁne nucleus of lcttermen are
back from last year/’s crack team.
The gymnasts posted a 6-3 record
in dual meet competition and
ﬁnished third in the Eastern finals
and captured ninth place in the
NCAA Tournament.

Most of the Panthers strength
this campaign will center in the
flying rin_gs. Tom Darling, last
year’s NCAA champ, along with
Dave Hirst and Jack Hammond
will again represent the Jungle
Cats this season. The trio swept
the Easterners in this event.

Hirst, Hammond, and Don
Neeld will anchor the tumblers
while Darling should ldd some
more points on the horizontal or
high bar. The specialist on the
high bar will be Jim Mulvihill
who scored seven ﬁrsts in dual
meets during the 1957 schedule.

John Cacolice is the Panther
threat in the rope climb. The best

The Blue and Gold hoopsters, under the direction. of
Coach Robert Timmons, are, accordingly, hard at the grind

of daily practice. Since October 15, starting date under
NCAA rules, seven holdovers and twelve newcomers have

 

new prospect on the side horse is

been drilling in the Darragh

Street pavilion.

Leading the array of returnees are co-captains Chuck

Hursh and Julius Pegues and pro-
liﬁc point-maker Don Hennon.
This trio was instrumental in
pacing last year’s team to a 15-9
record and a spot in the NCAA
championships. Between them.
they tallied in excess of 1100
points in 27 encounters.

These veterans, plus an unde-
termined Jaair will entertain the
Michigan Wolverines on Wednes-
day, December 4. at the Field
House to inaugurate the ’57-'58
campaign.

Freshmen Help

lAt the present, John Mills, Dave
Sawyer, Bill Zito, and Lloyd
Simpson are lighting for the two
remaining assignments. '

Howis Lester, Dennis Dor-
man, and Bill Vvoznicki are
other veterans on the squad.

Up from the freshman team of
last year, in addition to Mills,
are John Maure, Tom Maloney,
and John Mandish. The ﬁfth
“M” of the fresh, Gene Massari
is ineligible this semester.
Sizing up the early prospects,
Coach Timmons is distinctly cau-
tious. “We have the three man
nucleus of Pegues, Hursh, and
Hennon to build around,” he com-
mented.
Stars Missing
“I believe that it will take time
to work in two strange boys and

sophomore Don Kasner. John
Marcinko, who isn’t eligible until
February, will help on the parall-
el bars, along with Don Shima.

So few ‘fans know the work involved in building a winning team.
The boys don’s don’t spend. an idle week, then suddenly build up

steam. »
Don’t lower morale by
’em.

stoically sitting —- fans you’ll only thwart

Be proud of your top-ten team and get on the ball and support

‘(we need all the time we can get.

The progress of the team has been
{good up to this point. My Veteran
|threesome has improved
last year and will be in a strong
position to lead the whole squad,”
added Timmons.

Absent from this year’s ag-
gregation are several key op-
peratives of the ’56-’57 NCAA
team. Importantly, John Lazor
and John Riser are not on the
scene. Lazor rounded out his
Jungle Cat career by becoming
the leading scorer in local hoop
history. In three varsity sea-
sons he tallied 1175 markers.

Mate John Riser came into his
own at the very end of the year,
particularly in the tourney, and
wound up with a career total of
1160. ‘

Hennon, a junior from Wam-
pum, had angamazingly successful
first-varsity year. He led the team
scoring with 573 points and was
named to the Little Man’s All-
American.

Hennon stands at a shade over
5'10”. His performance placed
him second in the all-time one-
year point standings and estab-
lished the one-hand jump-push
shooter as a positive threat to
Lazor’s new mark.

“Upon request, even a portion
of those 1800 refused to sit in the
deplorably empty Block ‘P’ sec-
tion. This lack of spirit was also
manifested in the absence of sup-
port for the cheerleaders.”
