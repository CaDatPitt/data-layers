Convocation Center to be built, ut no   os here or when

ByBrianBerger

Showcase Editor

If anything has become clear
about the university’s proposal to
raise a Convocation Center/
Basketball Arena, it’s that nothing
is clear at all.

Concerns and debates sur-
rounding the $35 million project
were voiced yesterday at an open
hearing in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room. Governor
Casey’s Operation Jump Start has
cleared $13 million toward the
construction, while Pitt plans to
chip in an extra $22 million for the
project.

The hearing was offered by the
provost’s committee on the pro-
posed construction of a 15,000-
seat arena to be used for basket-
ball games and as a commence-
ment arena for Pitt’s graduating
class.

But members of the university
community used the hearing to
urge the committee to turn the
complex into a multipurpose unit,
with the capacity to hold every-
thing from physical ﬁtness facilities
to recreational space to meeting
rooms.

Basic questions surrounding the
arena, such as its location, have
yet to be finalized. Carol Sprague,

chairperson of the committee, said
the site selection “is pretty wide
open” but noted “there are only
so many places it can be built.”

Whether students’ ritualized
pregame walk up the hill to the
current basketball arena,
Fitzgerald Field House, will be
eliminated is still in question. Sites
have yet to be proposed, but
Sprague noted that Panther
Hollow or a site “on top of the
hill” had been raised.

Chuck Knoles, the men’s swim-
ming coach, who isn’t a member
of the committee, offered a plan
of his own. “I’d put it smack
between the two libraries.”
Referring to the recently renovated
parking area nestled between the
Hillman and Carnegie Libraries.

For that to happen, Pitt would
have to make up for the parking it
would wipe out, since parking is a
major concern of the 14-member
committee, which consists of stu-
dents, faculty, staff and administra-
tors appointed by Provost
Henderson.

The committee, which is not
responsible for determining a site,
will have a weight of community
problems and partisan issues to
consider when they meet on
Friday and make their recommen-
dation to the provost.

Semester at Sea drops
anchor in Pittsburgh

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Pitt senior Kenn Gaither
could not believe that he trav-
elled last semester from an
underdeveloped village in
India to the pyramids of Egypt
in just one week. In fact, he
said he was so astonished that
he practically had to pinch
himself.

Sophomore Jennafer Smoker
said she almost felt the same
way. Her unbelievable experi-
ence occurred in an airport in
Kiev, Ukraine, where she
applied her limited Russian
vocabulary in a conversation
with an old lady preparing to
visit New York City.

“I wasn’t just a tourist. I
could communicate and relate
and get to know her and the
other loca1s,” Smoker said.

These adventures were all a
part of the “Semester at Sea”
program aboard an 18,000 ton
floating university equipped
with classrooms, a library, the-
atre, student union, cafeteria
and athletic facilities.

More than 5()0 other under-
graduate students representing
170 colleges and universities
across the United States partic-
ipated in the Pitt—sponsored
four—month voyage to almost
every corner of the world.

“lt’s a big world out there
and to get a chance to see it is
something that forces you to
look at yourself and your own
culture,” Gaither said.

From Kobe, Japan, to La
Guaira, Venezuela, the boat
docked in more than 10 coun-
tries allowing the students to
stay with host families, visit
universities or explore histori-
cal, cultural and religious sites.

“The best thing about this
journey was that you never
know what can happen when
you walk out into a country,”
Gaither said.

One of his favorite experi-
ences was entering a “mud
Olympics” on a deserted island
close to Hong Kong. Over
1,500 people gathered to
watch nine teams slide
through the mud in a sack
race and boxing contest.
Gaither’s team finished fourth.

“I appeared on MTV Hong
Kong and it was great. I found
it really bizarre to participate
in something like the [mudl
olympics when I was expect-
ing a leisurely day of sight-
seeing,” he said.

Gaither also recalls watching
the sunrise from the top of the
482—foot Cheops pyramid in
Giza, Egypt. Even though
climbing the pyramid is illegal

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 28, 1993

Next week commemorates Eating Disorders Week

Remember the “Freshman
Five?” No, it’s not a rock
group from the ‘60s. It was a
term used to describe the
inevitable five pounds that
freshmen, especially fresh-
men women, gained during
their first year at college.
That was 10 years ago. Today
it’s called the “Freshman
Fifteen.” Ask Sally. She was a
victim of bulimia. It all start-
ed when her boyfriend back
home commented about her
“putting some weight on.”

Along with the weight gain
came feelings of dissatisfac-
tion with her body, low self-
esteem and the compulsion
to diet. When counting calo-
ries failed, she tried not eat-
ing all day. But her body’s
need for food was stronger
than her willpower, and at
night she binged on cookies,
ice cream and donuts.

Feeling disgusted that she
“blew her diet” and angry at
herself, she forced herself to
vomit and vowed that tomor-
row she would “be good”
and start on her diet again.

and diet, what’s really both-
ering her is a host of unre-
solved emotional issues like
feelings of inadequacy and a
lack of control over life.
According to Dr. George

Today Sally is a sophomore, Hsu, “normal” adolescent

include long-standing feel-

around feelings and food.

Religion is

Diversity
Week topic

By David Baard
For The Pitt News

As part of Diversity
Week ‘93, Pitt’s Office
of Residence Life held
a panel discussion
where people from
diverse faiths spoke on
what it is like to be

members of their
faiths.
ORL sponsored

“Something to Believe
In,” a discussion which
focused on religious
diversity, yesterday in
the Tower A
Conference Room.

Joseph Hollist, a
member of the Church
of Latter Day Saints,
said that being a
Mormon can cause
feelings of isolation
and loneliness,
because Mormons
adhere to morés or
customs, which differ
in some details from
those of non-Mormons.
For instance, Hollist
said that Mormons
abstain from drinking
tea or coffee.

He also said
that Mormons believe
the Book of Mormon
was revealed to
the founder of the
LDS Church, Joseph
Smith, complements
the Christian Bible and
is part of sacred scrip-
ture. I

Martha Charepoo
spoke about the
Baha’i religion and
its three basic princi-
ples: one God, one
religion and one
humanity.

She said the Baha’i
religion arose in Iran

in Egypt, he bribed the guards
by offering them $10.

“The sunrise was something
you would see on a postcard.
You see the fiery sun coming
up above Cairo and on the
other side you see the desert
and the moon,” he said.

While on board, the stu-
dents were required to take at
least 12 credits from a variety
of classes accredited by Pitt
and taught by visiting profes-
sors from around the world.

“This was not the Love Boat.

We studied hard, and the
classes met everyday, includ-

-ing most weekends. After

experiencing a country and
then trying to process it, I
found it very difficult to return
to the ship and buckle down
for academics,” Gaither said.

Everett taught several of the
courses including “American

anniversary voyage to

sailed a similar route that was
once taken by
Columbus.

This set off a series of
debates about the impact
Columbus had on American
Indians. Everett said some stu-
dents argued that Columbus’
intentions in the new world
were positive while others felt
they were genocidal.

“The debates were interest-
ing and it was neat to sail the
same route,” Smoker said.

“It was also amazing how he
did his trip on such a small

ship, and here we were on a
huge ship that by this time in
our voyage seemed so small.”

Aside from academics and
the overwhelming cultural
experiences, Smoker said she
went on the voyage to study
an even more pertinent sub-
ject.

“As much as I learned
about the world, I learned the
most about myself. It's funny
how in order to learn some-
thing that is so close to you,
you have to go so far away,”
Smoker said.

They’re lined up six deep.”

One decision the committee
said it would recommend is not to
replace any existing structures but
to urge for renovation. Others
in attendance battled for the need
for storage and recreational space,
as well as space for non-varsity
clubs on campus. O n e
area where things of this nature
can be handled is in the Bellefield
Annex, 21 building that appears to
be wide open for interest groups
and has already been secured $8
million in Jump Start money.
Nearly all of the groups who
spoke yesterday expressed an
interest in the Annex.

Committee member Maureen
McClure sounded a. realistic note
toward the politicking involving
the arena’s construction. “There
will be winners and losers, not
everyone will be happy.”

Despite the jump Start funding,

the new center is headed for a fis-
cal debate as well. Questions of
mortgage payments, operating
costs and interest payments were
all raised at the forum.

“Would someone please tell me
how to pay for this building?”
McClure said.

Later, she urged alumni and
graduates to “start writing checks,
because Pitt is one of the worst
alumni check—writing groups.”

Both committee members and
those in attendance were outraged
at the present facilities and their
effect on recruiting. Some mem-
bers were “appalled” by the facili-
ties and urged that something be
done.

“I don’t know how they recruit,”
said a staff representative who had
recently seen the conditions of the
facilities on the hill. “When was
the last time the trustees were on
this tour?” said McClure in a refer-
ence to the Board Of Trustees

who will hear Chancellor
O’Connor’s recommendations.

Also discussed was the issue of
how to generate revenue if the
arena is built. Concerts and special
events will put the university into
a bidding war with local promot-
ers and the Civic Arena, but were
discussed as possible revenue
boosts.

Of similar concern was whether
the university would act as its
own booking agency or hire a
“managerial entity” to handle its
events. Even if the arena is to
become a “big-time Big East
arena, it is apparent that basketball
alone won’t ﬂow the costs” com-
mittee member Tom Misuraca
said.

Despite the various groups
pleading their cases yesterday, the
biggest problem surrounding the
new arena appears to be the site
and whether the university will be
able to situate it on already-owned
land. Pitt may have to acquire
new acreage for the development,
possibly further complicating an
already complex matter.

Professor John M. Tyler,
a political scientist,
said he described
Christian Science as a
hard science dedicated to
discovering the laws of
spiritual reality. He
devoted most of his time
during the discussion
defending the Christian
Science View of the treat-
ment of illness.

He stressed that while
Christian Science does
not oppose the ordinary
application of medical
science to the treatment
of disease and illness,
it does believe that
the outcome of any med-
ical treatment depends
wholly on the will

of God. For this
reason, he said, prayer
can have a decisive

influence on the success
or failure of such treat-
ment.

Majid Al-Kaylani
spoke of Islam’s univer-
salism and said that its
message cannot be used
to justify any form of
chauvinism, such as
nationalism.

He said that Muslims
repeat sacred texts five
times a day to remind
themselves that they
should not be wholly
immersed in materialistic

pursuits.
Brenda Riehl, a
Christian, and Errol

Bolden, a member ‘of the
Church of The Nazarene,
both said that being a
Christian need not detract
from the enjoyment of
life.

Her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton and she is now the
first lady of the United States. She graduated near the top
of her law school class at Yale, has fought long and hard to
protect the nation’s youth and was voted one of the top
100 lawyers in the country last year.

Now she is about to redefine the role of America’s first
lady. It is a welcome change and long overdue. This is not
to say that women have played a minor role in their hus-
bands’ administrations. Edith Wilson nearly ran the White
House when her husband Woodrow was paralyzed. Eleanor
Roosevelt was a delegate to the United Nations after the
death of her husband and an important emissary to over-
seas installations during World War II.

_But for the most part, the role of first lady has been
largely underestimated. This is due in large part to the fact
that presidential wives had little direct impact on policy
making. With the appointment of Hillary Clinton to head
her husband’s national health care team, this will all
change.

It is a welcome relief that as the president’s closest advi-
sor, her advice will become public. Hillary will not be rele-
gated to the position of secret advisor and happy home-
maker. Her position affirms the role of women as co-work-
ers and partners — not as dependents.

She will no doubt be scrutinized by the media and others

for her actions. Furthermore, there will be cries of nepo-

tism by much of the public. But at least now the first lady
will be accountable for her actions.

Hillary Clinton is extremely qualified to do the job, and
she has been an active policy maker for years. This is all
that should matter to those who say we elected Bill and not
his wife.

Gays in the military?

It’s refreshing to know that the old “gridlock” didn’t die
with the Republican administration.

What’s not so refreshing is the subject which the new
administration, still in its formative days, has locked horns
over.

Congress is up inarms over Clinton’s decision to lift the
ban on homosexuals in the military without first asking its
approval. Particularly vocal members, such as Robert
Dole, are voicing their discontent loudly while threatening
action in the form of an amendment reaffirming the ban on

gays.

Clinton, at the same time, continues to entrench himself
deeper into his position, disregarding dissent from ranking
military officials.

It’s good to see‘ that Clinton is holding true to at least
one promise, especially one that advances the cause of
equality and constitutional rights.

It’s time for our government to put this issue behind

itself. Clinton’s best action would be to assert his
presidential power now and move on to the many-varied
and infinitely more important issues facing our country
today.
Q Any time spent filibustering over this issue will be noth-
ing but valuable time wasted at a point in time when our
country needs to focus “like a laser” on the issues. that are
pertinent to the lives of everyday Americans.

Buck up, Bill. Show Congress that you’ve got
what it takes to confront and execute without

letting .the rusted cogs of big government impede your

progress.

After exactly eight months
without a paper, the
Pittsburgh communityseems
excited with the merger of
the Pittsburgh Press and the
Post-Gazette. Copies of the
paper on its first day back
were snatched up by 7 a.m.
in ‘stores and by noon in
vending boxes. Combining
the Press and the Post-
Gazette has given jobs to 81
Press employees, and the
number of pages in the
paper has gone up.

Many Pittsburghers are
rejoicing at the return of the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, but
how many are mourning the
loss of the Press? I don’t
mourn the loss of the Press
as much as I hate to see
Pittsburgh join the numer-
ous other cities in this coun-

. try that have only one major

paper. This trend of after-
noon papers going out of
business is country-wide.

I am just as hopeful as the
next person that the “best of
the Pittsburgh Press” can
work together with the best
of the Post—Gazette and cre-
ate a great paper, however,
I also feel that the Press
could have and should have
been saved’. 0

There are few cities com-
parable to Pittsburgh in

population that each have

only one newspaper with a
circulation in the same
vicinity as the Post-Gazette
— Charlotte City, N.C.,
Portland, Ore., and St.
Louis, Mo.

_ At 1east,two major. papers

are needed to properly rep-

resent a metropolitan area
of this size. There are many
people out there -— 582,000
in Pittsburgh —— and they
need choices. Cable televi-
sion has MTV and VH-1,
HBO and Cinemax, USA and
TNT — at least two to
choose from in any major
channel category.

The Post-Gazette’s new

mission is to provide its
Western Pennsylvania read-
ers “with the finest source
of information and enter-
tainment.” Can this paper
really handle that? Will
small towns be slighted in
this effort? All of Western
Pennsylvania is too much
for one paper.

Creating a monopoly in
the newspaper business is
not a good idea. The
chances that a new compa-

 

Jennifer
Spagnuolo

ny will come in and start up
a new paper to compete
with the Post-Gazette is very
unlikely, so allowing the
Press to go out of business
iscutting -‘all. euture possibli-
ties. -5 " I

The media can control
what events are covered as
well as how they are cov-
ered. And with only one
major written source of
news in the area we cannot

_put much trust into what we

are. reading while being
bothered by what perspec-
tive we are being shown.

With. more than one, paper;

we would have a variety of
articles, issues and points of
view from which to choose.
It’s too bad that the city will
lose the benefit of diversity.
Putting limits on our
access to a paper is inadver-
tent censorship. Allowing
the Post-Gazette to buy the
Press is like allowing WTAE
news to buy out WPXI and

  One paper not healthy for Pittsburgh

KDKA — not being able to
see your favorite anchor
team deliver the news is a
little like not being able to
read a preferred writer in
the paper.

I do, however, give credit
to the Tribune—Rei/iew for its
amazing increase in sales
since the strike. It increased
from 53,000 to 94,000 daily
and from 86,000 to 212,000
on Sundays during those
eight months and is opening
an office in Pittsburgh. If
the Tribune-Review works
hard enough it can become
strong competition for the
Post-Gazette, and that’s
what we need. However, I
have to wonder if Tribune
fans will move to the Post-
Gazette now that its back.

Competition forces people‘
to work harder at what they
do. That’s what will be
missing for Post-Gazette
reporters — some tough
competition. In this case,
the Post-Gazette may try, to
take on the duty of repre-
senting Press fans as well as
its own. In completing
this task we may end
up with a paper that has

eral “swooning," bringing a lilt-

play between Nathan (Craig

, between the pairs anatomy and

Leopold and Richard Loeb —
both Jewish, intellectual and
homosexual. Their kidnapping
and murder of 13-year-old
Bobby Franks" captured the
public’s attention, spawning
two previous explorations on
film (Rope and Compulsion). In
Swoon, writer/director Tom
Kalin gives us their story in
ways Hitchcock and Welles
could never touch.

Kalin places both characters
historically —— their criminality,
marginality and homosexuality
intercutting newsreel
footage and recreating the peri-
od convincingly in a time of
cultural warfare in America
(sound familiar). We get a run-
ning commentary that’s painful-
ly funny and very smart. When
the trial’s description of the
“deranged duo’s” sexual rela-
tions gets explicit, the judge,
ironically, orders all women
from the courtroom. And Kalin
inserts a hilarious psuedo—
phrenology on the relation

their criminal and homosexual
tendencies. It was Richard’s
“enlarged penal gland” that
accounts for his being gay, and
so on.

Kalin plays off of the hysteria
of the public at the time of the
trial, its hyper-voyeurism on the
nature of the crime and its per-
ceived link to Leopold and-
Loeb’s homosexuality. Szuoon
turns that voyeurism inside out,
exposing the farce of an
uneven system of justice. The

Chester) and Richard (Daniel
Schlachet). Kalin avoids any
melodramatics. Even the little
piece the famous duo and
friends are dramatizing in the
film’s opening scene seems
more indicative of Leopold and
Loeb‘s pretensions than the
film’s.

Reading in voice-over from
dated diary entries, Nathan and
Richard (or “Dickie” and
“Babe“ if you like) take us
through their exploits as they
situate the.mselves in time.
Nathan reels off a list of famous
homosexuals while Richard
finds small satisfaction when
they’ve “made the papers.”

Kalin illustrates a sense of
thrill for Leopold and Loeb in
their own marginality, in going
past “the boundaries of intelli-
gence for some.thing more
pure." Under interrogation each
takes a certain delight in
recounting their version of the
crime. Once caught they revel
in their celebrity, especially
Loeb.

Despite the attention the film
gives to Leopold and Loeb‘s
tangled relations, this film is
not about homosexuality.
.S'z1¢oon is about marginality and
how poorly and comically it’s
handled in America. Kalin gives
us a painfully funny and telling
account of social stupidity in a
period piece that translates
much too easily. Maybe
because Leopold and Loeb are,
in some way, no less marginal
today than in 1924. lt’s really a
shame when the best we can

and suggest that the boy
showed signs of being raped.
The sordid becomes silly under
Kalin’s direction. He lets the

The police don’t fare any bet-

ridiculous questioning of
“bachelor teachers” at a boy’s

Swoon even finds time to
mock psychoanalysis and that
venerable “alienist” Sigmund
Freud. We see Nathan’s analyst

its a terribly common and
wholly uneventful little story,
and like most of the trial’s
speculation, it’s absurd.

Karl Hendricks Trio
Some Girls Like Cigarettes
Big 10 Rex

A problem that many fear is
that love and rock can’t recon-
cile themselves in one so, so, so
immaculately sad as Karl
Hendricks. There is a widely
whispered supposition that if
the right woman came along
Karl would lay down his guitar
and concentrate on making
himself happy.

It seems as if the 40 or 50
secretly sappy ones that come
out of the paneling for every
local appearance of the Karl
Hendricks Trio have a
masochistic investment in the
man being miserable. Those
folks have, over the months,
observed Karl’s songwriting
become increasingly emotive,
maudlin and cathartic. During
recent performances, the Trio

‘paralyzed audiences with a par-

ticular tune, so final, so dad-
blamed depressing, that if he

were ever to perform anything
the slightest bit more cheerless
he would spontaneously coin-
bust right there in front of the
abject tearful. The song is called
“The last Thing You’ll Ever Do
for Me,” and it is the most per-
suasive suicide soundtracks I
have ever wept over.

On the shiny new eight-song
Some Girls Like Cigarettes 10-
inch, “The Last Thing You’ll
Ever Do For Me” is nestled like
a cyanide pill in a gift basket of
alcohol, razor blades and other
assorted instruments of anger
and woe. Those who haven’t
yet wiped the tears from The
Trio’s Buick Electra LP are
somewhat prepared. Those
unaccustomed to the pure,
bleeding heartbreak purveyed
by this threesome should listen
with a stable friend.

The yin of Karl’s talents are
his balls—out rock songs. The
first two cuts on the record
belong in this category. The title
track, a roaring look-at-what-

you’ve-done-to-me invective,
romps along with a beer—bellied
distortion that almost drowns
the vocals, swimming in drunk-
en excess, disdaining coffee
(“intellectual piss”) for more
malty beverages: “some nights I
miss you/ some nights I miss
you more/ some nights I miss
the bed/ and have to sleep on
the floor.” Between verses, the
guitar takes on a rat—squeak
lead, offsetting the idea that
this souse could do damage to
anyone but himself.
“Pittsburgh’s Hottest Babes”
takes an opposite slant, busting
on group-boy bonding in the
face of another night alone,
with equal rock and rage.

On the other hand, Karl’s
most sensitive, eyeball—watering
poetry is enhanced by softer,
whispery tunefulness, guitar-
weeping-gently vocals kept
from breaking by the mellow
steady heartbeat of Tom
Hoffman and Tim Parker in the
rhythm section. “It Could Be a

Miracle” takes this to a mysteri-
ous abstract extreme. The lyrics
imply a kind of despondent
frustration with whatever rut he
happens to be stuck in. I can’t
help thinking this somehow
about Karl’s decision to concen-
trate fully on his music: “maybe
life through your knuckles/
could make you happy again.”
When The Trio merges these
two musical tracks, the result is
usually a complicated roller
coaster ride through an emo-
tional purgatory, alternating the
hard and soft sections that com-
plicate the originally minimal
songwriting style, as on “The
Last Thing You’ll Ever Do For
Me.” This cut opens on a chord
progression reminiscent of
Galaxie 500. Karl’s plaintive
wail, on the edge of breaking
down altogether, pieces togeth-
er a horrifying living will,
instructing the source of his mis-
ery to kindly, gently, ever so
tenderly, cut his throat: “Wish
you’d say I’1n happy now you’re

here/ Wish you’d say now that
your gone away I’m so scared/
You once said I like the way
you make me sore/ Wish you’d
say anything to me anymore.”

When Karl throws a tantrum
he stamps on his distortion
pedal. This song escalates into
such a frenzy of anguish that its
only release can come with that
wave of amped crunch
employed so often in moments
of Hendricksian distress.
Somehow I can’t help drawing
analogies between The Trio’s
songs and the circulatory system
(see “Dead Flowers” on Burtcle
Electra), but this final purge
makes me visualize great tor-
rents of blood issuing from the
man’s neck, the five discordant
pulses whimpering from the
guitar are the last weak surges
of Karl’s jugular. Beautiful.

While these songs have
increased in their complexity,
the structuring more creative,
instmmentation more proficient
and production more pristine,
the final cut hearkens back to
when Karl put out four-track
cassettes for his friends, and not
too many people took him so
seriously. “How’s the Cat,” is an
acoustic remembrance of a sim-
pler Karl. Apt for an outfit that
is finding romantic admirers
with every breath.

Karl and the Trio are invading
this scene with an escalating
omnipresence that is almost
intimidating. Some Girls Lt/ee
Cigarettes is in the WPT S Top 10

It's hide and see for the butler at the Playhouse Theater

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

So what did the butler see?
Several cases of mistaken identity, a
lot of sexual innuendo and overall
mayhem, which provides most of
the appeal for the Playhouse
Theatre Company’s production of
What the Butler Saw.

What the audience didn’t see,
however, was the butler, which
makes one question the thought
process behind playwright Joe
Orton’s title. The only plausible
explanation I have is that the audi-
ence is the butler. This makes little
sense because the action takes
place in a private psychiatric clinic,
and although some private clinics
resemble country clubs (i.e. The
Betty Ford Clinic), most of them
don’t come with butlers.

This is a minor textual discrepan-
cy, but nonetheless, one that is
hardly unnoticeable. Another
noticeable snag is the frequency
with which coincidence is
employed. Coincidence is part of
everyday life, but this goes beyond
the realm of reality and borders on
ludicrous. But then this is a farce
and that’s what farces are supposed
to do.

What also doesn’t go unnoticed is
the amount of energy and talent in
this production. Farcical comedy
depends on timing, and the timing
of this cast is impeccable. The only
glitch is that you have to really like
British farcical comedy. The
Playhouse Theatre Company tends
to do plays that are lighter in con-
tent compared to the more daring
productions of smaller area compa-

nies, including Point Park, which is

housed in its basement.

These productions generate an
older, more conservative following.
What the Butler Saw seems geared
to this audience. However, the
quick-paced British humor isn’t
severely conservative. For instance,
a psychiatrist at the institution says
of his wife, “She’s harder to get into
than the reading room of the British
Museum.”

Marital conflict runs amuck in
What the Butler Saw, although most
of the humor comes from rampant
accusations of insanity and incestu-
ous goings-on. Every trick is
dragged out of the bag to maximize
the scenarios. Watching this assem-
blage of local talent, it’s evident
that all cast members know exactly
where they fit into this riddle of a
script.

Charles R. Altman particularly

stands out as state psychiatrist Dr.
Rance. His manic gestures and voice
inflections perfectly undermine the
controlled demeanor he exhibits in
the name of professionalism. At one
point, the pseudo-reserved Dr.
Rance is in the middle of a shouting
match and Altman's face actually
turns scarlet, like the mercury hit-
ting the top of a thermometer.
Overall, the Playhouse Theatre
Company’s rendition of What
the Butler Saw is both entertaining
and surprisingly short. Under
two hours running time, the pace
and the language is fast, but not
necessarily racy. So if you’re in the
mood for some offbeat British com-
edy, head on down to the

-Playhouse and catch What the

Butler Saw. It runs through Feb. 7

One of the goals of every business is to achieve 100% customer satisfaction.
However, after over 20 years as a restaurantuer, we have come to realize that this goal is
unrealistic because everyone’s taste in food is different. As they say, “one man's ceiling
is another man's floor.” Therefore, when we read in The Pitt News that the buffalo
wings at three other establishments were rated higher than those of ours. C.I. Barney's.
we were disappointed but kept the opinion in perspective. Since we pride ourselves in
serving the highest quality food at a “reasonable price,” we were upset by two critical
errors that were made in the article. First, the wings sold by C.J. Barney's are fresh, not
frozen. We never have. nor ever will. serve frozen chicken wings. Second, the Friday
happy hour wings are offered at no charge from 5 to 6 p.m. Our wing night is Tuesday
from 9 to 11 p.m., when wings can be purchased for 20 cents a piece.

In an effort to correct the earlier inaccuracies, we would like to extend the following
offer to our customers: bring this ad with you to C.I. Barney’s from January 28 to
February 4 and with an entree order, you will receive a free small order of wings from 7

Blood Circus
Primal Rocle Therapy
Sub Pop Records

In his liner notes to
Primal Rock Therapy,
Sub Pop bossman

Jonathan Poneman admits
than when the record first
appeared four years ago, it
met with bad reviews and
became the worst-selling
release in the young label’s
history.

Yet Poneman believes that
this CD is a necessary reis-
sue. “When the Grunge

Bible is finally compiled,”
he said, “the Book of Seattle
would not be complete
without mentioning Blood
Circus  There are a bunch
of you who have scored
your Soundgarden,
Mudhoney and Nirvana
records thinking you have
the grunge crowd covered.
No chance.”

Baloney.

Just admit it Jonathan, CDs
sell, and — for the moment,
at least — grunge sells. Now
that this whole grunge craze
has gone national and has

 

permeated fashion as well
as music, Sub Pop wants to
cash in on it by rereleasing
a disbanded group’s EP with
a few bonus tracks, right?
That must be the label’s
reasoning, because Blood
Circus does not have many
distinguishing features.
Mudhoney and Nirvana at
least have a knack
for garagey-pop hooks
underneath those raunchy

guitars.
And Soundgarden goes
completely over the

top with its slow, bom-

After about the sixth or
seventh tune, everything
begins sounding the same,
usually slow and droning
over one or two chords.

Perhaps the MTV grunge
generation will enjoy Blood
Circus. But in the end,
music like this is only good
for remembering why punk
rock (grunge rock’s
estranged father, remem-
ber?) came along in the first
place: to get away from
dreck like this.

bastic heavy metal rehash-
ings.

At best, Blood Circus
recalls Motorhead without
the sense of humor. The 11
tracks on the disc don’t
sound all that original or
novel and they don’t really
add new life to stock heavy
metal formula.

Song after song rework
the basic 1-4-5 chord pro-
gression. Vocalist Michael
Anderson attempts to sound
big and tough, but ends up
sounding overblown and

fake. -Mike Shanley

The Lilys
In The Presence Of No/lying
Slumberland Records

The Lilys hail from
Washington, D.C., also
home to Velocity Girl and
Whorl.

The group earlier
appeared on SpinArt’s CD
compilation ...One Last Kiss,

- with “Any Several Sunday”

(unavailable on their debut
album) and Simple
Machine’s 7-inch box set
Nezizpo/from Metropolitan
with “Claire Hates Me.”
The Lilys’ debut full—length
effort is titled In The
Presence Of Nothing, an
achievement of hypnotic
melodies and whispering
vocals, surrounded by a
mesh of fragile guitar feed-

back.

The album begins with
two soft and spacey tunes,
“There’s No Such Thing as
Black Orchids” and
“Elizabeth Colour Wheel.”
The latter begins with a
humming guitar noise, lead-
ing into an outstanding
song. This set of songs has a
charisma that sent me mildly
tossing my head back and
forth.

The explosion of sound.

crashes with “Collider” and
follows with “Tone Bender,”

“Periscope,” “It Does
Nothing For Me" and
“Snowblinder.”

The guitars and bass

are much louder and the
drums pace a faster beat
than the previous set, but
the vocals are not drowned

 
     

 
   

out by the instruments.
“Tone Bender” is a great
song. Very heavy in guitar,
and the vocals are just a
whisper. I was playing my
brand new Rickenbacker
“Air-guitar” to this set.

The next track is an
unlisted instrumental, a
slow and drowsy song.

It extends over 12 minL1tes
and its low moaning
organ and clashing
guitar is a reminder of
Joy Division’s “Atmosphere.”

“The Way Snowflakes
Fall” and “Claire Hates Me”
are the encores of
the album. They lose

some of the heavy feed-
back distortion, but the
lyrics are barely decipher-
able. “Claire Hates Me” is
the finest song from the
album and possibly the
entire year.

If you like the sounds of
My Bloody Valentine and
Velvet Crush, add this to
your collection. The Lilys’
album is ultimately superb,
so go out and buy it imme-

-diately. If you can’t seem to

find it at your local inde-
pendent record store, make
a pilgrimage to Lancaster
(home of their distributor,
SpinArt) like Alex P. Keaton
once did, and buy it there.

Leary is brilliantly unabashed in
his assault on the unmention—

able.

On the logic behind taking
cocaine: “I’d like to do a drug
that makes my penis small,
makes my nose bleed, makes
my heart explode and sucks all
my money out of the bank! Is
that possible, please! Where do I
Sign up?!”

On crack: “I would never do a
drug named after my own ass!!!”

On NyQuil: "'NyQuil is the key
for all you 12—step recovery peo-
ple. You can drink it! It’s over
the counter! ‘Are you drunk? No,
I have a cold. I’m high as a kite
and my teeth are green! Merry
f-—v—ing Christmas!’ “

On Ted Kennedy: “A good
senator but a bad date, okay
folks!!”

On happiness in life:
“Happiness comes in small
doses, folks — it’s a cigarette 
or a chocolate chip cookie  or
a f1ve—second orgasm. That’s it,
okay!!!

“You come, you eat the cook-
ie, you smoke the butt, you go

okay!!! End of f—-ing list!!!”

On the movement to enlarge
cigarette pack warning labels:
“Like, the problem is, we haven’t
noticed yet  It doesn’t matter
how big the warnings are.

“You could have cigarettes
that come in a black pack,
with a skull and a crossbone on
the front, called "Tumors”
and smokers would be
lining up around the block
going "I can't wait to get my
hands on these f——ing things! I
bet you get a tumor as soon as
you line up!”

Serving as the sinister—yet-sat-
isfying side dish to Leary’s full
course of venom—laced standup
routine is a quartet of repugnant
light-hearted (greasy lard light-
hearted) ditties, including the
devilishly humorous “A—hole”
and “Voices in My Head.”

The sing-along “A—hole”
opens the album, setting the
tone for the spew of beautiful
bile that Leary exhales through
the duration of his ensuing
standup routine: “I use public
toilets and piss on the seat/ I
walk around in the summertime
saying “How about this heat?” 
Sometimes I park in handi-

capped faces/ I’m an a——hole
ll-Ie’s an a—hole, what an a—
hole!I/ I'm an a—hole IHe’s the
world’s biggest a——hole!l."

“Voices in My Head" employs
a REM/Replacements
guitar/backbeat sound to deliver
an upbeat, hummable jig about
aimless brainchilds that Leary
has delivered in his three-plus
decades of existence. In other
words, it’s Leary’s spoken
standup gig put to music: “\Vhy
is it every time I turn on my
television set, I gotta see Sally
Struthers and those starving
kids? Why can’t somebody just
send her a check and shut her
and those god damn kids up?
\X/here’s Rob Reiner when you
need him?”

The other two tunes,
“Traditional Irish Folk Song” and
“The Downtrodden Song,” don’t
quite cut the same smarmy smile
of the aforementioned songs,
but neither are garbage Iactually
they are  and that’s what
makes it fly].

Overall, with the tunes and
the tales of excess and stupidity,

Jerry McCullough's attacks were squelched by the Syracuse defense last night

By Rob Pugliese

Sports ztssistant

The Pitt wrestling team continues its

' quest for national respect.

The Panthers turned in a solid, work-
manlike performance, cruising to a 25-15

Wrestling grap

victory over the Cleveland State Vikings last .

night at Fitzgerald Field House. '

The win pushed Pitt’s dual meet record
to 4-1-1 and evened the team’s Eastern
Wrestling League mark at 1-1. Coming off a
tough 15-15 deadlock with 15th-ranked
Navy over the weekend, Pitt responded
with a complete team effort.

“Everybody wrestled pretty hard. That
was very pleasing to me,” Pitt head coach

Orangemen, 95-79

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

After driving in for a layup
and drawing a foul late in the
first half, Adrian Autry put his
hands on his hips, nodded his
head in accordance with the
referees call and looked as if
he was the man in charge.

Autry
was in
charge, and
n o t 11 i n g
could go
wrong for
the Syracuse

Orangemen
guard, who scored 31 points
last night, leading the

Orangemen to 95-79 crush over
the No. 13 Pittsburgh Panthers
at the Civic Arena.

“Tonight [Autry] had it, it was
there for him,” Syracuse head
coach Jim Boeheim. “When he
plays that way, we’re a whole
different team.”

With the win, Syracuse
improves to 11-5, 3-5 in the Big
East.

Pitt, with Seton Hal1’s loss to
Georgetown, fails to gain sole
possession of first place in the
Big East. Its record slumps to
13-3, 6-3 in the Big East.

Autry, who broke out of a
shooting slump, was near per-
fection from three-point land,
bombing six of seven, and each
one was deadly.

“He hit 27 of 30 threes at the
end of practice,” Boeheim said.
“He was hitting everything and
it carried over.”

And if it wasn’t one thorn in
Pitt’s side, it was another.
Forward Lawrence Moten
scored 25 points and center
Conrad McRae had 15 points
and seven rebounds.

For Pitt, it was not a good
time to have Syracuse come to
town. In the Orangemen’s last
three games, they shot 39 per-
cent. Last night they had a
coming-out party, hitting 35 of
67 shots (52 percent).

Panther guard Jerry
McCullough had the hot hand
in the first half, scoring 12
points and keeping Pitt in
reach of Syracuse. But in the
second half, the Orangemen
zone defense made it tough for
Pitt to score.

“We got caught off guard,”
McCullough said. “We haven’t
played against a zone in a
while.”

McCullough failed to score in
the second half, finishing the
game with 12 points, eight
assists and eight rebounds.

Pitt often found itself playing
catch—up against the
Orangemen, especially in the
first half. Trailing by 11 points
with 12:59 left in the half, Pitt
pulled within two, 22-20, after
a Chris McNeal dunk. McNeal
led Pitt with 24 points.

Then trailing 41-35 at the
start of the second half, Pitt
came out like gangbusters. Pitt
went on a 9-0 run to take a 46-
43 lead behind Ahmad
Shareefs three-pointer and 10-
foot jump shot.

Pitt then held its own until
the eight-minute mark when,
trailing 64-63, Autry hit a trey.
to put Syracuse ahead for
good.

Syracuse went on an 18-2 run
which lasted nearly six min-
utes. In that span, Pitt saw cen-
ter Eric Mobley foul out with
4:39 left in the game and the
Panthers trailing 74-66. Mobley
had 2 points and 3 rebounds.

Pitt had trouble scoring all
night, making 12 of 35 shots
from the field.

The Panthers did control the
boards,out-rebounding
Syracuse 22 to 18. McNeal led
the Panthers with 12 boards.

Rande Stottlemyer said. “We needed 118 
142 was a big one. I thought Brett [Gould]
did a great job. I know they didn’t expect
us to beat them there.” ,

Gould may have surprised the Vikings,
but this was a match Pitt expected to win
comfortably and they did just that. Mike

sion and Richey gaining a pin at 4:08.
First-year wrestler Gould (142) rebound-
ed from a tough start, pouring it on to com-
pletely dominate the final two periods in an
impressive 11-4 decision over John Mazey.
Senior Steve Budman continued the
onslaught at 150, poundingcraig Wise 18-

6. Budrnan had his way throughout, relent-
lessly attacking Wise en route to an easy
major decision.

Sean Gibbs wrestled very sluggishly at
167, but managed to grind out a 5-2 deci-
sion over Monty Oh]. Always critical of his
own performance, Gibbs said he just
couldn’t get into the ﬂow.

“He was throwing my timing off  I
couldn’t get any offense going. I felt kind of
sluggish too,” Gibbs said. “As long as I
keep winning, I don’t really care.”

On a night where Pitt kept the pressure
on, nobody dominated like Jeff Kloiber. In
scoring a 24-9 technical fall against Fred
Lima, Kloiber made it look frighteningly
easy, racking up takedown after takedown

in an utter whipping. Kloiber explained his
strategy of continually letting Lima up
rather than collecting an early pin.

“[Graduate assistant coach Scott] Hovan
told me to just go outand attack him,”
Kloiber said. “I get more out of a tech fall
instead of pinning him. That’s kind of use-
less to me. I just wanted to get some work
in, so I can go the full seven minutes
against a tough opponent.

“Right now I’m not anywhere near where
I want to be. I know I beat the snot out of
this guy, but I have a long way to go if I
want to win a national championship.”

Perhaps the most intriguing matchup of
the meet came at heavyweight where Pitt’s

  Women ’s hoops deﬁes predictions, powers to second in Big East

By]. Alan Brarne
Staﬁ‘Writer

Although it was ranked seventh
in the conference by the preseason
coaches poll, the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team has powered its way
to a second place tie in the Big
East a little more than midway
through the season.

With a 15-5 record, (5-2 in the
Big East), the Panthers have
proven that their preseason rank-
ing was unwarranted. They go into
the Miami game tomorrow night at
Fitzgerald Field House tied for sec-
ond in the conference, a mark that
is not stuprising to their coach. '

“If you would have asked me if

we’d be 10-5, 5-2 in the Big East at
this time in the season, I’d proba-

bly have said ‘yes,’” head coach"

Kirk Bruce said. “I never thought
that Syracuse would have beaten
us [59-61]. In actuality, we proba-
bly should be doing better than
what we’re doing at this point in
time.”

The Panthers have shot the ball
well so far this season, notching a
46.8 percent average (going into
Sunday’s 73-52 loss to the
Connecticut Huskies.)

Center Turia Ransom is among
the leaders in the country with a
strong 67.2 percent average. The
majority of the scoring comes from
the inside, where preseason all-Big

East pick Jonna Huemrich has
combined with Ransom to carry
the Panthers.

“I would like to see more consis-
tent shooting from our guards,”
Bruce said “We need to get them
involved a little bit more than we
have in the past.”

Bruce said that shooting over 70
percent from the free—throw line is
a big priority for him. The Panthers
haveiconverted 70.4 percent of
their attempts from the charity
stripe, but have had some big
misses, especially in the
Georgetown and Syracuse games.

Huemrich has been her usual
consistent self, leading the Panthers
in scoring with a 19.1 points per
game average and rebounding
with 9.1 boards per game. The for-
ward has provided Bruce with
needed baskets. _

Ransonrs play is more of a sur-

prise. Not only does she lead the
team in freld—goal percentage, she
also leads the team in offensive
rebounds and provides a defensive
force in the middle.

Ransom went on a stretch earlier
in the season in which she was on
fire, averaging over 20 points and
seven rebounds per game, but a
recent knee injury has limited her
play.

“Her knee is not quite up to par
and I could see it the last couple of
games,” Bruce said. “It’s going to
be hard to rest her like we need to
because of practice and the games
are coming back-to-back. But so
far she has played really well.”

Despite their size, the Panthers
have rebounded the ball well. One
of the smaller teams in the confer-
ence, Pitt has had to work harder
in the paint for the loose balls.

“\Y/e’re getting our share,” Bruce

said. “Anytime that you have your
guards rebounding for you, then
you know that you’re doing OK.”

The Panthers most glaring prob-
lem has been their enormous
number of ttunovers. They have
given it up 313 times — 59 more
times than their opponents.

“\X/'e’ve been talking about that a
lot,” Bruce said of his team.
“Sometimes we try to make the
great play instead of making the
easy pass. \X/'e’re working on con-
stantly protecting the ball.”

A minor disappointment so far
this season has been the play of
point guard Carol Morton.

“She’s been disappointed in
what she’s doing,” Bruce said. “I
expect Carol to be that spark 
but she’s been sporadic. She‘s had
some good games of late but she’s
also had some not so good games.

Defense

Continued from page 7
24 points as long as it kept Pitt’s big—play man,
McCullough, under wraps.

The Syracuse zone was also aided by Eric Mobley’s foul
trouble. When the Panther center got his fourth foul at
17:49 left to go in the second half, the Orange had the def-
inite size advantage.

Syracuse also got help from the Panthers in other ways.

“We didn’t move,” Pitt forward Antoine Jones said. “We
just kind of stood around.”

With Syracuse playing tough zone D and Pitt showing a
lack of luster in its own offensive game, the Orange pulled
away midway through the second half.

Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim did not really make
the decision to go to the zone, he was forced to.

“Our man-to-man [defense] sucks,” Boeheim said. “We
haven’t stopped anybody all year [in man-to-man].

“But we’re covering the outside shooters pretty well [in
zone] and we’re not just giving them shots. We’re pushing
up and trying to defend out there.” _

That is exactly what caught McCullough unaware and
eliminated him from the game.

“It’s not hard to play against the zone,” McCullough said.
“The first game we lost against Georgetown was because
of the zone, and we didn’t have a lot ball movement, we

.haven’t seen it since Georgetown and tonight we got
caught with it [the zonel again.”

The Rod Serling whispers still echo.

thafs not something that we’ve been doing.”

Two games against Top 20 opponents prepared the Panthers for the
rigorous conference schedule. Despite losing both games (59-70 vs.
Iowa and 69-82 vs. Penn State), Pitt proved that it could play with both
teams.

“You tend to store things away, and what you store away from those is
that we were in both games against national caliber teams,” Bruce said.

“To take a look back I feel that we have come along way,” Bruce said.
“So I’d say all in all I’m pleased with what’s going on record-wise but that
we’ve got a long way to go in the things that we’re doing and were still
looking to do that.”
