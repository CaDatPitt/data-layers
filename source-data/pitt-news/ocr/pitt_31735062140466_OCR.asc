. the trimester plan is both ‘necessary and de-
sirable, many‘ agree it will be too hard on
them, ﬁnancialy, physically and socially.

The survey of opinions on the plan was
taken by” Pitt News reporters Friday. They
did -not choose students to interview but
picked at random, trying to get an accurate
cross-section of the average student in the
University. ,

Gerald Ziskind, law school freshman: “It
is nota matter of desire; it is a matter of
compulsion. We must have educated soldiers
so that they will appreciate the immensity
of their duty.”

.15‘ Sam Devey, C44:‘ “it's the best thing that

could have happened. It enables a student

to equip himself to serve his country to the

best advantage in the least possible time.”

Roy Williams, Ed43: “For the guys who
work in the summer, it’s hell.”

‘Milton Snideman, E44: “I. don’t like it.
The material presented in a semester re-
quires more than a few months to be ade-
quately digested.”

A -Aithough the majority of students believe '

Edith Buckman, C45: “I think it's a pret-
‘t5' ty' good idea for engineers and those who
want to get through school fast."

Phyliss First, C45: “It’s a ﬁne plan but
cuts out vacation money for those who need
it.” .

/ Florence Waisbrot, C45: “I don't like it

is ‘because it takes the men away too fast."

Faust Rosa, E44: “It’s a good idea if I
can get enough money.
Enzo Capoferri, C45: “It’s all right, but
we should get at least a little vacation.”
Harold Ma-son, C44: “It sounds good for
fellows getting out of high school now.” ‘

James Dunn, C44: “If they put it through, i

I'm going to school two semesters and work
in the summer. I need my summer relaxa-
tion.” _
“Tom Welsh, C44: “it's too hard on stu-
dents."

Michael De Marco, C43: “I think it’s a

‘good plan and is necessary for the speéded

up defense program.” "

James Rial, E43: “I think it’sswe1l. It
gets engineers out early so they can help
industry.” .

Walter West, Ed43: “It will probably
give me a chance to graduate before my
draft board gets me.”

Ann Hornbeck, C43: “In spite of the con-
fusion the trimester set-up wiﬂ cause in ex-
tra-curricular activities, I will be ‘glad to
get out of school sooner.” _

Lois Rowbottom, C44: “I don't like the
idea of getting a semester ahead of friends
who cannot attend school during the sum-
mer."

Lee Raizman, C42: “It’s a pretty good
idea if you like going to school inthe sum-
mer.” '

In a series of interviews Friday with most

of the deans of the schools the following in-.

formation was gained concerning the ac-
celerated program and how they thought it
would affect the students of their particular

Dr. Einar W. Jacobson, dean of the Sc
of Education, «

“Meetings have been held with the heads
of some ‘public schools, but no deﬁnite de-
cision has been reached among them. If the
trimester plan is to work here, high schools,
junior highs, and elementary schools must
go along too. Otherwise there will be gaps
in the supply of college freshmen. Before

ool

we can put the plan to work here we have.

to get the facts on how many students have
to work during the summer and how many

can be here for the summer sessions. Those

facts must be had before we can do any-‘
thing deﬁnite.”
* * *
Dr. Vincent W. La‘nfear, dean of the
School of Business Administration,

“The members of the faculty have held a
meeting and have voted they are more than
willing to co-operate with any plan that is
decided upon by the administration. We
have begun a study of the curricula in order
to see what changes can be made to fit in
with the war effort.

    

   

  
  

“I do not think the trimester plan will be
too hard on any students. After all, when‘
they graduate they will be working 12
months a year and often doing harder work
than they are ' doing now. I don’t ‘believe
school work ever presses students to the

extreme of their ability.”
* 3 Q

Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore, dean of the
School of Law, ‘ '

“The accelerated program is all right
if the students are willing to work much
harderand can stand the expense. If a stu.
dent can meet these requirements, no don t

the trimester system will beneﬁt him."

Dr. C. Leonard O'Connell, dean \of --the

School of Pharmacy,

“The _School of Pharmacy. works under the .

rules of a national group, the American As-

sociation of Colleges of Pharmacy. Until a"
decision is made there we will work under .

the present system.” (Note: Some national

    

 
  
  
  
  

   

agreement must be reached, probably an. 

tailing a certain amount of state legislation,‘ [j

for pharmacy schools are restricted by law if‘.
in their methods of operation.) "Until this 

agreement is reached there is no point in?
our making any changes. When it does-‘_

come we will make every fffort to ﬁt in ‘

with the program.”

2. follow the instructions of

and talents. ,

The plan will be organized un-

ﬁre squad will be held responsible
for detecting and extinguishing
ﬁres. ~
The duty of the traffic squad
will be to direct all students and
faculty from the’ class rooms into
a central gathering-place in the
, hall. 1
~The blackout squad willgbe
charged with extinguishing all
lights and pulling shades on each
floor.

Members of the ﬁrst aid squa.d

twill be technically trained and will

carry ﬁrst aid kits. Their‘ task will
be to render attention to all in-
jured persons.

Other campus buildings will have
similar systems.

Special UDC

From a ‘special investigation of
the construction of the Cathedral,
engineering experts have found
that, as protection against air as-
sault, it is the “safest place in the
-city” because bombs fall at an
angle and direct hits are improb-
able. Due to the steel and concrete
construction of the Cathedral the
center halls have been judged the
safest refuge from air attacks.

»The real danger of air raids lies
in blasts of nearby high explosive
bombs, incendiaries, and falling
fragments of anti-aircraft shell§,

defense council officials said. It is .

very essential that no one except
authorized workers leave the build-
ing or even the floor in case of an
attack, they warned.

First Aid

Course Offered Free

_Beginning January 19, a special 11-hour course in ﬁrst aid will be
offered to students free of charge as part of the University defense pro-
gram, Theodore W. Biddle, assistant coordinator of the University de-

fense program, announced today.

Captain John P. Cameron, as-
sistant professor of military science
and tactics, will teach the course
and will have as his aides and lab-
oratory assistants seniors in the
medical school.

Classes will be conducted from
4:30 to 5:30 o’clock Monday, Wed-
nesday and Thursday evenings in
Cathedral classrooms. ,

Students may register for the
courses on available forms in office
of the dean of men, today,.Janu-
ary 12 to 15. '

Approximately 80 of the most
qualified students will be chosen.
However, two more courses will be
given in the future. Over 200 stu-
dents are expected to be trained.

ester begins. Next issue will be

‘In London, colleges and universities have estab-

stance, a surplus or shortage of instructors.

In this way, if some‘ college needs an instructor,
the bureau is notiﬁed, and the proper adjustment is‘
made. For instance an instructor may be sent from
Oxford to.l\/lanchester. S T ' -

Leads  In I-F Competition

135- JERRY‘ RIBP. " i .
With only one-quarter of the sea-

son already past, Pi-Kappa Alpha-
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon took an
early lead this week in the annual

-.;: fraternity table tennis and volley-
: ball" competition.

. When the standings were releas-
ed, 36 games had been in the ping
_._ pong race, and the PiKA’: had
"come, through with a perfect rec-
ord. Sparking the team is Tom Mil-
Tler, a freshman, who was Eastern
State titleholder last year. Team-
ing up with Miller is long George
.Wedd and Tom Armagost. These
two were t e regulars of last sea-
son's team, but Miller was good
enough to push one of them aside.

Close on the heels of the fast
moving PiKA outﬁt, is the Phi

, Ep team which has lost only two

of the 36 games. Jimmy Deutle-
baum, Jay Silverberg, and Bob
Broudy are the men responsible
for the good showing of the team.

ln third place, but pretty far be-
hand the PiKA’s and Phi Eps, are
the Pi Lams with a record of 24
wins and 12 defeats. Burt: Engles-
~berg teams with Lenny Wolk to
serve as the Pi Lam regulars, with
Jerry Feingold and Herb Josephs
as replacements. . L
A record of 14 wins in 24 starts:
gives the SAE’s the fourth notch.
The SAE team is made up of Jack
So_uth\vorth, Jack Speed, Willisg‘
smog and Bill Howard. - .:
Heading the volleyball. league:
with a clean slate in six games are;
the SAE’s. Tw-o ._members of the;
ping pong team, Southworth and’
Schug, plus Walt West, Alex Co-A
petas, Glenn Greenawald, and Jacki
Davis make up the league leading‘
aggregation. - , _
Phi Delta Theta also boasts '21
perfect record, but have played on-
ly three games thus far, and must
be content with second place. How-
ever, Larry Brauer, Ken Defoe,'Bob
Christman, Bob Sell, Jack Kenny,
and Bob Stodgell stand a good
"chance to overtake the SAE’s and
still cop the title. '

The Phi Gams can make a three
cornered race out of the volley-
ball ﬁght for they have only one
loss and have more wins than any
other team in the league, eight.

Rolling over Delta Tau Delta by .

a 40-20 score Thursday evening,
Phi Kappa remained undefeated in
the fraternity basketball league.

John Prushnok with 14 points 1

and Joe Connell with 12,l_ed the
Kaps scoring. This was the ﬁfth

straight victory for the Kaps and

broke their deadlock with the
PiKA’s who were idle.

Theta Chi smashedlsigma Alpha.

Epsilon 66-46 as Edgar Jones tal-
lied 20 points. Fitchko and Schlac-
ter with 15 and Vetter with 14 aid-
ed in the lopsided victory. Williams
was the high scorer for the losers
with 14 points.

Phi Gamma Delta downed the
Sammies 35-23 in the other con-
test played. McBride led the Phi
Gams with 15 tallies. The Phi Delts
added a victory to their record as a
result of Lambda Chi’s forfeit to
them.

Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Lambda
Phi mutually agreed to postpone
their scheduled game until later as

a result of the early examinations.

 l.istl.ess Covenantrr 

Getting back to normalcy after three hectic; engagements
With Mid-Western teams. and ad burlesque affair with Car-
negie Tech, Pitt’svarsity basketballers go after win number

three when they meet the Geneva Covenanters this Wednes- 3

day evening on the Stadium floor. .

_ With Alurd “Slim” Ransom coaching the team this year, '
the Covies doubtless have a new system of play along with

their new coach. The system is different than the one used
last year which gave tlier-fa record of nine wins in 22 games.

Among the 13 losses suffered by
Geneva, last season were two ad-
ministered by Pitt, 50-36-, and 55-
41. =

Leading the team from Beaver
Falls is captain John Billie, who is
known as the “Blond Bomber” on
the Geneva campus. Billie rated
with the all-time greats of Cove-
nanter basketball, has been the
sparkplug of the team for the past
three years.

> Teaming up with Billie, at the
forward posts is John Rayz, a first
year man. Thus far this season
Rayz has been high scorer for the
year. DeVenzio is rated the best
foul shooter on this season’s Gen-
eva team.

Ransom has had an experienced
team to work with for none of last
year’s team graduated or has been
drafted. Earlier this year they de-
feated Carnegie Tech 43-32, in a
game which they played without

 the services of captain Billie.

There is a possibility that the

‘ war may yet affect the Panthers

'be‘fo1'e the season is over. It had

been feared’ that co-captain Eddie _

Pitkin Club. will Hear

meeting of the Pitkin club on Wed-
nesday at the church.

o’clock at the Fifth avenue e’n-
trance of the Cathedral.

After the luncheon.the members
will discuss Dr. Keri-’—s talk on the
current war problem.

Cinclermen Hold
Practice Drills ..
For Indoor Card

Despite the cloak of frigid
weather that old man winter has
thrown around the top of the “hill,”
Coach Carl Olson’s indoor track
contingent is rounding into shape
to tackle their ﬁrst intercollegiate
competition on February 7 at the
Millrose games in Madison Square
Garden.

. The Millrose games are one of
the highlights in the seasonal an-
tics of the Blue and Gold indoor
team. lt has become one of the
outstanding track gatherings of the

,sport world, in that it brings to-
gether the outstanding spike aggre-
gations in thecountry.

Coach Olson will have one point
in mind when he rolls his team in-

‘ to New York. And that is to at-

tempt to crack the mile relay mark.
He has a more than average chance
of doing it. He has one of the great-

est mile relay units since ‘he took

over at the helm of the cinder ship.

,With. crack speed merchants like
“Hap” Stickel and “Bullet Bob”
Carter, carrying the brunt of the
attack, and with two more speed-
sters drawn from the list of the
prdmising, the feat does not seem
impossible. The pair of middle men
will be selected from Winch, Pere-
tic, Alias, Shug, and Wit.

Uncle Sam again has extended
his hand ihto the Blue and Gold
track squad. Coach Olson may not
be able to keep :‘Red" Jessup be-
cause of the draft.

The “speed-up” program at the
University of Pittsburgh, Olson be-
ieves, will have little effect on the
track situation at Pitt. He empha-
sized that the senior boys on the
outdoor squad should be allowed
to compete regardless of early
graduation. .

rferrment until graduation.

Paifrath is scheduled to go Janu-
ary 21, but he has applied for de
ferment until he can ﬁnish this
year and graduate. If he is re
fused, Paﬁrath stated that he
would enlist in the
serve.

Semester Draft
Deferments 
To Continue

University students who face a .
prospective draft call will likely
be granted a deferment "to ﬁnish
any semester they begin, Dr. Eu-
gene A. Gilmore, dean of the School
of Law and head of the University
draft committee, said today.

“The tendency of draft boards
has been to permit students to com.
plete the semester before calling
them for service. This varies with

individual draft boards, however,
and the war situation may change
this at any time. Students will like-
ly be notiﬁed of an imminent draft
call before each semester begins so
that they may make arrangements
accordingly,” Dr. Gilmore said.
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dedh
of the.College and E. A. Holbrock,

ing arid Mines, are the other mem-
bers of. the University Draft com-
mittee which forwards to draft

J fourth in a series of articles deal-

When the little daughter of King
Albert I and Queen Elizabeth in-

» nocently appeared at the Interna-

-tional Historical congress in Brus-

,. sels with her tennis shoes on, Blos-
‘ som L. Henry, assistant professor

,. _ of modern languages at the Univer-

When a four-hour dinner was
served at the Paris home of a
French duke, Miss Henry was a
guest.

But when enemy bombs destroy-

L * ed thousands of lives and inestim-
, able property in Manila, it was only

her determination to receive her
doctor’s degree from Columbia uni-
versity that prevented the dimin-
utive, quiet-spoken French teacher
from being at that memorable oc-
casion also.

Travel has taken Miss Henry in-
to more royal courts and has ac-
quainted her with more interesting
ﬁgures in the_ few years she has
been visiting foreign countries than
the average woman gets to know
in a whole lifetime.

One of her best friends, Dr. De
Martel, was at one time oﬂicial sur- L
geon to the Czar. De Martel com-
mitted suicide the day German sol-
diers entered Paris.

Paris has always been Miss ‘Hen-
ry’s main point of interest, and she
spent the summers of 1925, 1930,

- 1936, and 1937 there. But her devo-

tionto France has not limited her
itinerary to that part of the world.
Italy, Japan, China, Manila, and
various parts of the United States
have been’ included in her travels.
While in Manila she studied Span-
ish and was offered a position in
the Manila Normal school, which
she declined to return to Columbia.
While at Columbia, Miss Henry
was given the opportunity to come
to Pitt and fill out the year. She
took advantage of the offer, and
has remained here since then, with
the exception of a 13-month leave.
of absence from 1922 to 1923. At
that time she went to Paris to

study at the Sorbonne andkto be-
gin a new thesis with the help of
M. Gustave Lanson.

M. Lanson had published a few
months before Miss Henry could,
an article on the same subject as
her first thesis had been. For that
reason she had to give up her work
pnd begin again, and she had to
go. to France to write it:

Miss Henry, a Colorado-born‘
graduate of the University of Den-
ver, has taught mathematics, phy-.
sics, and chemistry in addition to
modern languages. She was once

a high school teacher in Colorado, _

another_ time in Montana.

She has eaten ﬁne foods in some 1

of the world's most obscure places;
French delicacies such as brains and
snails were among them, but she
prefers simpler dishes.

topic, “And sometimes they were
found in the smallest, out-of-the-
way restaurants imaginable..”

It was while in Paris that she

Ar RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, we hear, they have a course,
in practical telephone speech. In this course, two stu-
dents talk by telephone while the class hears their
conversation by means of a loud speaker.

The conversation is recorded electro-magnetically on
a tape at the same time so that later the students can
hear themselves-—usua1ly with amazement-—and can
iioin in the critical discussion.

What kind of a mark would you get in this course!
Is your telephone voice distinct, natural, courteous,
pleasant? Do you organize your conversation so that

you don’t waste time?

Do you’ dial with care to avoid wrong numbers? Do
you hang up properly after every call? Do you answer"

every call promptly?

We hope you can answer “yes” to all these ques.
