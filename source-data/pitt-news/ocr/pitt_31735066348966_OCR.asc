HumanConcern Group

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Internal ﬁghting and disagree-_

ments were as much to blame for
the demise of the Council for
Human Concern (CHC) as admin-
istrative red tape, according to
CHC members who wish to remain
unidentiﬁed.

-f?",,j_‘j'/“The first few meetings were

unbelievable,” said one CHC
member. “We fought about the
members the chancellor had
appointed, we fought about our
jurisdiction, we fought about

_ everything. That was why fewer

and fewer people attended the next
meetings.”

“Resignations began pouring
in,” said another CHC member.
“We were ready to take on the
administration to fight racism at
Pitt, but I don’t think any of us
were prepared to take on each
other.”

The CHC was created as an ad
hoc council of the Senate Council in
February, 1973, to study racism in
Pitt hiring policies, admission

ﬁstandards, curriculum and ﬁnancial
aid to minorities.

Sexism was
added to its jurisdiction in March,
1974, when the Senate Council
voted to continue the CHC for
another year. -

ness of the CHC and hopeful that

Committee (UAAC) would even-
tually look into areas assigned to
the CHC, its members recommen-
ded its deactivation at the
September Senate Council meet-
mg. -

Two years of inaction finally
forced the few remaining partici-
pating members to consider ter-
mination. “We felt that by
disbanding the CHC, the Senate
would be forced todiscuss why it
had failed,” CHC member Dr.
Marvin Bellin said.

“The CHC’s recommendation
will come up at the October 2
Senate meeting,” Bellin said, “and
although I don’t expect a lively
debate, I hope enough public
interest has been aroused to force
more discussion. If we find out
exactly why the -CHC was so
ineffective, the Senate may be able
to create a new committee more
potent than the first.”

CHC member Mary Lou Smith
said she felt that the Senate will
never be able to create an effective
council to study the problems of
racismand sexism at Pitt.

“The Senate is so broad and is
composed of so many different
types of people that I don’t think
we ever could be sure they would
support any implementations a
Council for Human Concern pro-
posed,” Smith said.

The UAAC will be more effective’

than the CHC because its members
are more dedicated and its
responsibilities and procedures are
more clear cut, said Assistant to
the Chancellor for Academic
Affairs David R. Powers. “I don’t
think the administration was at all
to blame for the_failure of the CHC.

I think its members took their
responsibilities too lightly and were
further hampered by the total lack

of definition of duties," Powers _

said.

Myslinski Report Defendecl  

BY TOBI ROSEN

A mistake in semantics resulted
in the student- leaders’ call for
Athletic "Director Casimir Myslin-
ski’s removal, but at no time did he
intentionally misrepresent the
“sellout” status of the Notre Dame
game, Chancellor Wesley Posvar
said Wednesday afternoon.

The remarks came at a special
session of the Board of Trustees’
Student Affairs Committee meet-
ing ‘originally scheduled to discuss
dormitory security.

One hundred and twenty stu-
dents jammed the meeting in
Dining Room A of the Student
Union to air their grievances with
the football coupon system and the
alleged inconsistencies in Myslin-
ski’s statements. "

Posvar claimed the confusion
erupted over conﬂicting definitions
of what constitutes a “sellout.” .

According to a statement issued
late Tuesday by Myslinski, a_
sellout occurs when the request for
tickets V surpasses the available
seating. even though all the tickets
had not been distributed‘. ' * ‘

Platt said that the inconsisten-
cies remained unresolved. ”

Assistant to ‘ the Chancellor
Edward Bozik said, “A freeze was

which the Athletic Director said no
tickets were available for the Notre
Dame game.

them,” Tive said. “Every position
for which an application is filed will
beexamined by the Board.”

The Remuneration Board has
established certain criteria to be
used to evaluate the difficulty of a
student's position in an organiza-‘
tion, Tive said. The Board will
consider the time demand of a
position, the specialized skills or
experience required and the
complexity of the duties.

‘There will be seven criteria,
which will be sub-divided into
degrees, and each degree will be
assigned a .point value,” Tive
explained. “The positions will
then be assigned a salary grade on
a 10-grade scale, and the students
in the grade with the most points
will receive the highest remunera-
tions.”

All funds paid by the Remunera-
tion Board will come from the
Student Activities Fee. The day
school Student Government Board
(SGB), the School of General
Studies Student Cabinet’ and the

Graduate and Professional Student
Association will give funds to the
Remuneration Board to be re-allo-
cated to students.

“We don't know yet how much
money we'll be allocated," Tive
said. “How much money we get
will determine how many students
will be paid, and how much they’ll
be paid."

Tive stressed that the Remunera-
tion Board will evaluate the
position, not the person presently
occupying the position. "W'e’re
interested in the skills and time
efforts involved in the job,’ not the
performance of a particular indivi-
dual in the organization,” he
maintained.

‘‘I’m glad the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) approved the
funding of the Remuneration Board
this year,” Tive added. “Remune-
rations will help attract more
quality students and better leaders
into student organizations.”

The Remuneration Board is
composed of Tive, one faculty
member and two students selected

the most cost-effective fringe
beneﬁt the University offers.”
The study yielded this analysis:
The breakdown of those who took
advantage of this program included
960 staff employees and 255 faculty
or senior staff members. These
people attended classes under

direct beneﬁts, paying $5 per
student/credit hour instead of the

usual $40. Thus 1,215 recipients
generate more than enough money
to cover the marginal or incre-
mental costs incurred by the_

“The total cost to the University
under this part of the plan is very
low; 1.3% of the total salary budget
covers it," Freeman said.

But there is another _part of the
plan. "Dependents are included
under the tuition remission bene-
ﬁts. Staff dependents in the
program numbered 164 and faculty
dependents, 333.

Faculty dependents may receive
tuition scholarships of up to $1,000
a year to attend institutions of their
choice. “This is a direct outlay of
dollars,” Freeman said.

The total value of this beneﬁt,
according to Freeman, was about
$237,000 last year. Two hundred

‘and twelve people were involved in
the scholarship funding.

“Still, this doesn’t tell the whole
story," Freeman said. The pro-
gram generates income, too; the $5
credit hour and research contract
funds help offset Pitt's budgeted
fringe beneﬁts. The total income is

$386,000, which exceeds the total
cost ($237,000).

These study findings will be used
by the University to defend the
program against charges such as
the one made earlier this summer
by Shane. _

“While the institutions ‘are
pleading for more money from
taxpayers, they're losing $3 to $5
million annually under free tuition
programs.” —

Freeman counters, “This (pro-
gram) is good management." He
said it awards those who have
shown loyalty to the University and
encourages staff and faculty
members to remain at Pitt.

“This is not the public’s idea of
beneﬁting well-paid faculty. In
effect, this plan allows our
employes_ to buy the product

"(education) at a reduced rate, much
*like the benefits any major
corporation or agency offers. It
would be incongruous for the
University itself, which can best
provide this service at the least
cost, not to offer this,” Freeman
said.

Answering Shane’s charge "that
the program drains the taxpayers’
money, Freeman said, “The cost to
the taxpayers is zero, but to replace
it in salaries would cost them

plenty.”

and meet student concerns.”
Posvar went on to say that

- “meeting demands” was not the

best method for arriving at rational
decisions.

He explained that he was
responsible to the Board of
Trustees and that it was conceiv-
able the committee’s request might
exceed the bounds of “reasonable-
ness," in the board's judgment.

Platt, though, upheld his earlier
request for 50% student represen-
tation on the ad hoc committee.

“My concern for this commit-
tee,” Platt stated, “is that the
same kind of thing can’t happen

that did with SAAC (Student

Affairs Advisory Committee).’ ’

Platt explained that the commit-
tee was given two hours to devise a
better coupon exchange system.

“I was disappointed with the
outcome, or lack of it,” Platt said,
referring to Wednesday’s meeting.
He lauded the students in their
efforts to “band together” for their
needs despite alleged lack of
effectiveness.

Posvar said he was satisﬁed with
the meeting’s outcome and added
he was glad to see so many student
attending.

He stressed the importance of an
“open meeting” policy forstudents
to air grievances. “Public
meetings are for everyone to come
and give their say,” he said.

  . . . One Who Quit

The inquisitiveness of student reporters on the Duquesne Duke must
beapplauded for bringing about the resignation of one of Duquesne

 V  University's administrators after it was learned that he had falsiﬁed his

job resume.

A CadDobrin,whowashiredasdirectorofdevelopnmntatDuquesne
in May, 1974, and was promoted three months later to university
relationsdirector, claimedtohaveheldseveraljobstlmtwerenothis or
that never existed in the ﬁrst place.

. Among the inconsistencies in his resume were: a position at United
Press International when in fact UPI has no record of his employment,
a job as assistant foreign news editor for Associated Press from 1952 to
1957 when AP says the title was created just two years ago, a claim that
he received a BA in English and an MA in journalism at Columbia
University when Columbia has no record of Dobrin’s attendance.

The fact that a man with such reputable credentials was not checked
out by the university’s four-member search committee is deplorable
and should stand as an example to all university administrations.

.SinceDobrinwaspmn1otedfromhisoriginaljobatDuquesne,the-

quality ofhis work must have been at least satisfactory. This does not

overrule, however, the many inconsistencies in his resume, too many
to be accidental.

An administrator who is caught making misrepresentations should

_ be dealt with immediately, for no one knows to whom and what degree

he will make the next one. Though the ﬁrst inconsistencies may

beneﬁt the,man’s position and possibly the administration, how long

. will it take before they harm the university and its reputation?

In the issue of the Duke that broke the Dobrin story, there appeared A
another article written by the paper’s editor, explaining what a difﬁcult
job the staff had had in writing about the man’s action rather than

. about the man. lt’s always difﬁcult to keep personalities out of a

conﬂict, especially those conﬂicts that seem to recur between the same
parties.

After a while, student-administrator battles appear to be a game in
which one is eternally pitted against the other. But only a casual
observer would take this view. Those who are seriously committed to
the university realize that anew class of students arrives each year and

' that personnel ttnnovers in the administration occur. With

‘  personalities coming and going, and most of us meeting only by

chance, all that truly remains is the university itself. The abilities and
trustworthiness of its administrators obviously play an important role

‘- in determining the lasting impressions a university leaves with the

outside world.

This is why the article in the Duke that prompted Dobrin to resign
«the day after it was printed comes as a great credit not only to the
student reporters involved, but also to the entire university itself.

The Ancient Spirit of Tuck

‘ BY JOHN METCALFE

Universities are notorious hiotbeds of tradition.
Tradition intrudes upon the most trivial and the most
important actions of our lives. There is even a
tradition of mourning the passing of traditions as

they are phased out, extinguished or abandoned in V

the course of mindless Progress. .

I shall indulge myself in that last tradition. The -

Tuck Shop is no more, and I am distressed.

I do not mean to suggest the function of the Tuck’ , '

Shop ceased to be relevant; people still get hungry
andthirsty in the Cathedral of Learning. Nor has its
location been filled in or healed over like an ancient
wound; something called Burger Chef has been
wedged into the former site of the Tuck Shop. It is an
uneasy fit.

The Burger Chef is brightly colored and
aggressively modern. The Tuck Shop was
old-fashioned and slow and dull in the way that only

real wood and real glass can be dull. The people,

staffing the Burger Chef are almost without
exception young, brisk and neat. They are learning
their jobs quickly, and they probably are not paid
very much money.

The old crew was just that. Old. Most of the ladies
on . the serving line were beyond being merely
maternal toward the students they fed; they were
grandmotherly. One old gentleman went around
clearing away the debris. from the tables. This is
known technically as “busing,” but, as be practiced
it, it never seemed to be forced. I think I remember
him from my childhood, from 20 years ago, when l
was first taken to Pitt for some reason I have
forgotten. Already then he was charming, quaint--an
institution in himself. I wonder what has happened to
him. No doubt he was neither young enough," nor
strong enough, nor cheap for the new proprietors.

l have looked for him. He is not there. None of the
ladies from the Tuck Shop days is there either.

f Where can they havegone? '

All of this is sentimental rubbish. Efficiency wins
out over sentiment every time.
The new system is efficient, or it will be someday. I

‘ have given it two weeks so far, and it seems to be

improving fast. On the first day of operation [whieh,
by chance, was not the first day of classes] things
were a little bit slow. In a 10-minute break between
classes, I wanted to get a cup of coffee. Last year this
would have been a simple operation. "-1 Would haVe
gone through the serving line, gotten a cup, filled it
from a giant urn, added real milk or synthetic
creamer as the mood took me, and, at the end of the

1 line, given the cashier 15 cents. The whole procedure

would have taken about two minutes in the slack
hours of the day, about five minutes at the busiest
times I have known in the Tuck Shop. p,

Under the new system, orders are taken at a dozen
places along an endless counter. Each transaction is-
treated as a unit. The customer places an order. The
attendant, using a special pencil, checks off the
order on a standard form legible to computers, and
feeds the form into a computerized cash register. The
cash register ﬂashes the total, including tax. on a
display screen. and opens its cash drawer. A cup of
coffee. for instance. is 20 cents, plus two cents tax.

This is not quite 50 per cent more than what a
small cup of coffee cost last year. The cup is little bit
larger. but not much, and sales tax is charged. This
was not the case in thcpast. but it is understandable;

»-1.
-'1

Burger Chef is probably not anon-profit operation. . A

M When l asked for them. l was furnished sugar and

‘“cream." The cream substitute is the only substance

, available to dilute the coffee. unless the customer

wishes to purchase an entire container of milk.

This is a quibble, a mere matter of taste and a
complaint about a seven-cent increase in the price of
coffee. .

There were other problems that first day. though.
It took nine of the ten minuteslbetween classes to get
my cup of coffee. One problem was that the lines
moved slowly; each request for food or drink was
treated as a novelty. as it might well have been for
the people working the counter. Another factor
became clear to me as I waited. The computer is
quite choosy about its reading matter. Everything
must be noted in the sort of pencil it likes. From time
to time a pencil point would break. Panic. Nobody
had thought to install a pencil sharpener, or a dozen
of them, on the inside of the serving counter.

The computer goes beyond choosiness. Any error
in noting an order on the standard form causes the
mouth of the computer to close on it. There are
some things it simply will not swallow. When this
happens, the effects can be seen up and down the
serving counter. When the computer is worrying
about something at one of its many mouths, it shuts
down operations elsewhere until the problem is

' solved.

At any rate, I left disgruntled. I always had
wondered what disgruntled meant until I was it.

Another day, when I had almost two hours
between classes, I learned something else.

The Tuck Shop was never the best place on earth
for serious reading and deep thought, but it was
adequate. The wooden benches were padded and I
always found room under the tables to stretch my
legs. The light was hardly perfect, but it was as good
as that in most libraries. The noise was tolerable,
and, as a remedy to despair, I could always peer up
through the highclear windows for a clear though
narrow view of the sky (and the odd look at the
underside of pedestrians).

Now we have a new environment. We are the
prisoners of the people who design monstrosities like
the average fast-food store and the average airport
lounge. These places are not for dining or for
lounging. They are designed to get as’ many people
through and out as fast as possible. lt is no accident

' that the colors in the Burger Chef are bright to the

point of being garish. They are meant to be; they are
meant to make us uneasy, to make us think we must
have something more important to do somewhere
else. The are intended to‘ drive us out, as are the
seats.

lt is no accident that none of the seats is padded. It
is likewise no accident that the curvature of the bench
seats is more nearly a mirror image than a nest for
the human buttocks. This is the new world, Here at
Pitt. we have not been subjected to it before. We do

' have our quaintncsscs: places like Benedum Hall and

the Cathedral itself. which are not very comfortable.
So far. though. we have been spared the malicious
and cold-blooded attentions of such as the designers
of the Burger Chef, who make their livings
by assuring that we will all be uncomfortable in their
creations. '

l gladly would have that ancient busman. and real
milk in my coffee once again. ‘

Grad Dismayed
Over Peptsquad

I personally feel rather ashamed
and embarassed at the decision
that was made concerning Pitt's
cheerleading squad. _I feel too that
the exposure of such a decision is a

negative blow to the University’s

image.

What especially concerns me is
how or if this kind of thinking has
prevailed in past University deci-
sions and how it will function in

present and future actions of
maybe more significant impor-
tance.

As with the members of any

the limits of their jobs are able to
withstand the pressures of a
complex hierarchy.

The University’s high-level ad-
ministrators are that because they
can function within the system.
One such ofﬁcial is University
Secretary Albert C. Van Dusen, a
long-standing member of the Pitt
community. The office is nominally
of the same administrative rank as
the -vice chancellors’, but the
secretary’s near-20-year University
experience has given him authority
of a different nature.

“Some of the things I do are an
accident of that history,” Van
Dusen said, absently dismissing
more than 16 years of service.

Once an actual vice chancellor,
for the professional schools from

1959 to 1967 and then for program '

development and public affairs
from 1967 to 1971, Van Dusen was,

even earlier, the assistant chancel- V

lor for planning and development.

In 1971, several administrators
later, Van Dusen became secre-
tary. Although the office is
potentially one of immobilization,

The secretary keeps the official
University records. Therefore, he
is also responsible for keeping
other offices informed, through
fact-finding searches, in matters of
historical importance.

“This office facilitates the
ﬂow of information to and from
all the important decision-making
groups,” Van Dusen said, leaving
the “important" a relative term.

The Board of Trustees, however,
is the secretary’s primary concern.
The board is ultimately responsible
for all the policy-making, Van
Dusen said. And the board, with
its 10 standing committees, is
coordinated by the Secretary. Is he
aware of the potential power and
authority such a position repres-
ents?

“I’m in the interesting position
of being the interface between the
University community and its
policy-making group,” Van Dusen
said, modestly enough.

As University secretary, he is
also the board secretary, and the
coordinator for the 20 Boards of
Visitors that represent the schools

 

and divisions of the University.
And he is the University’s liasion
with the Faculty Senate, another
policy-making body.

University Secretary Albert C. Van u  I  

I double-dutiness of being an arm of

both the chancellor and the board.
But, he said, in a system of
delegated responsibility, his duties
to and for each were sufficiently
clear.

“lam both a‘ supportive arm and
an extension of the chancellor’s
office,” Van Dusen said. He
agreed his duties are what the
chancellor says they are.

The secretary, then, is respon-""

sible for the functioning of the
policy-making bodies, in the most
general of senses. »

But if the University’s organiza-
tion chart is .viewed from this
perspective of proper parliamen-
tary procedure, then where does
the provost come in? ,

Since the University doesn’t
follow a strictly formal organization
chart because academic matters
don’t correspond to neat lines of
ﬂow and boxes of authority, the

provost’s office can be justified"

but not easily explained.

“No office anywhere is auton-
omous,” Provost Rhoten A. Smith
said. “The office of the provost is
the result of a delegation of
responsibility for the major aims of
a university--rese-arch and educa-
tion.” ’  —- .r *

Smith stressed the coordination
of responsibilities among the senior
staff but especially in the lower
levels of the University structure.

The provost is the second highest
ranking official, theoretically only a

' few decisions under the chancellor.

But, like the chancellor, the provost
has a. staff of semi-autonomous

‘people who further divide the

available authority.

The non-speciﬁc concern-of the,
provost is the academic programs

of the entire University.

Broken down in terms of
personnel, the provost is respon-
sible for graduate studies and
research (through Associate Pro-
vost Edward Shoben, Jr.), the
regional campuses and cooperative
programs (Associate Provost Rob-
ert Nossen), and budgetary matters
and faculty records (Executive
Assistant Robert Dunkelman).
Two additional assistants (Assoc-
iate Provost Donald Henderson and
Assistant to the Provost Rayford
Steele) further siphon the p_office’s
‘duties.

. 

 

These men can specialize only so ~

much, for to do more would be to
usurp the vice chancellors’ author-
ities. The provost’s office is the
second and perhaps the last of the
formal organization chart levels.‘
.The considerable remaining
power and authority lies with the
vice chancellors and deans and
directors, all of whom operate with

increased and detailed specializa-~

tion.

‘Python’: Marx Bros. Revisited

Art Gallery
Opens Doors
  To Variety

BY MREA CSORBA

In case you missed’ it--there’s

good news for our town’ s unestab-
lished artists. ‘United Artists Inc.
Gallery openedlast summer as an
alternative to traditional galleries.

The opening hardly caused a
rumble within Pittsburgh’s ﬁrmly
Yet, if the
new gallery, located across the

street from Scaife Museum, can

capture the void created by the
traditional show places, winds of
change will blow through our
“Renaissance City.”

The gallery operates similarly to
the co-op galleries of the Soho area
in New York. After an artist’s work
is evaluated by a panel of judges
for professionalism of style, he is
invited to join. Annual member-
ship is $50, which entitles the artist
to exhibition space for numerous
works. A commission of 10% is
charged for any piece sold.

For many struggling artists, the
concept is overdue. A prerequisite
to showing at most galleries is to
have ready a resume of exhibitions.
If ‘the struggler is lucky, an
established artist will volunteer his
patronage and fanagle him an
exhibition at a local bank. But the
backlog is tremendous and the
two-year exhibition waiting period
may do an impoverished artist in.

Joining an art association is
easier, but the judging panel tends
to be tedious and conservative. A

revolutionary style often prohibits

membership in the group.
United Artists Gallery was set up
primarily as an opportunity for

unknown artists to display their

work while adding greater variety
in style. The gallery is not
interested in sponsors, connections
or reputation. Mel Aberegg, the
man who started, it all, stresses
good presentation and profession-
alism. Though his strength lies in
business management, Aberegg ha
learned to spot ineptness and
shoddiness. To supplement his
judgment, he draws on artists from
the surrounding universities in
planning each exhibition.

Between showings, which run
four to six weeks, the gallery wants
to give special presentations in new

successor in Monty Python.

The movie itself concerns the
group’s impressions of the old
King Arthur legends, particularly
concerning his divinely ordained
search for the Holy Grail. That’s as
close to a plot as you’re going to
get.

The group members each take
different roles, depending upon
what is needed for the scene, so
there isn’t really much of a strong

individualized characterization.
Instead, there’s more of a total look
at a very talented group of guys
capable of many things, most of
them downright weird.

Monty Python’s humor, though
not strictly satire, ﬁnds nothing
sacred. Death is dealt with in a
most cavalier manner--and one to
which more conservative audiences
may object--and even God is in for
His digs. Some of the “violence”

envious, but it’s all in the spiritiof
bloody good English humor.

One of the strong points of this
ﬁlm venture is the use of sound,
possibly due to Monty Python’s
long'career in successful comedy
albums (which have just recently
begun to trickle into the US market

on a mass scale). The background A

is not unlike the old comedians’
history of radio before ﬁlm, thus
giving the artists a chance to
develop a sound comedy based on a
lot of imagination. .
More recently, Monty Python
has been able to aim that
imagination in wild animation in

“Neo-Bodism” is a term coined

Not everybody likes
champagne. V

Comedy is in many respects like
suspense--it’s not fair to those who
haven't seen it yet to give away the
punch lines. Then again, Monty
Python doesn’t operate on a
traditional punch line basis, so
maybe it’s not really cheating to go
into some of. the humor.

Part of the humor, of course, is in

the absolute absurdity of even the
idea of a King Arthur, how he came
to power and how he manages to
deal in “real” life. He manages to
get the worst of several confronta-
tions, as when he approaches" a
peasant who lives in a commune
and screams repression when the
King tires of listening to his
chatter. And, of course, there is
the absolutely brilliant taunting by
a French knight who hurls such
lovely unprintables (among many

“things) upon the bewildered

monarch. :

In typical Monty Python digres-
sion [reverting to the basic
absurdities of everyday college life]
is an argument about the capabili-
ties of European versus African
swallows in carrying coconuts
[don’t ask for an explanation of that
one]. Another is the sideways logic
of a wise knight in testing whether
a young woman is a witch.
Following a simple logical argu-
ment, he determines that if she
weighs as much as a duck, then
she’s a witch. You try to figure it
out.

There are many other juicy
moments, but they’re best exper-
ienced first-hand. Monty Python
and the Holy Grail has the kind of
free-for-all humor that American
audiences have tasted with Mel
Brooks, but with a much sharper
sense of surrealism and a prefer-
ence for playing on violence rather
than sex.

With the success of many other
British imports (All In The Family,
Sanford and Son, et al) that have
flooded the US market in recent
years, it’s rather-surprising that
Monty Python has taken so long to
catch on in this country. _

Those staunch Python fans who
have had to scramble for import
labels and travel outside of our fair
city to see their TV show can now
take a breather, though. The
exposure the group is getting with
the new ﬁlm, not to mention an
American recording outlet, will
make Monty Python’s insanities a
bit easier to obtain. Or contract

whichever the case-may be. _

And on the sixth day, Bud
Wilkinson made the Oklahoma
Sooners. And he gave them great
speedy backs named Pruitt,
Owens, Washington and Davis.
And he gave them the wishbone
offense to eat up ground like a
great shifting sea. And‘ when he
had finished what he had wrought,
he said it was good.

Despite what one might think-
about Wilkinson, he wasn't a god.
But he did start a bit of a dynasty
while coaching the Sooners, then
handing the reins over to Chuck
Fairbanks, who carried on the
tradition of winning with men
named Owens and Pruitt.

Two years ago Barry Switzer
came in and took over. He “ain’t
done bad” either, winning 21,
losing none and tying Southern Cal
on his first time out.

And if Wilkinson wasn't one of
the chosen, neither is the Okla-
homa team of ’75 unstoppable,
impregnable or unbelievable.

But they sure are trying.

For starters there is quarterback
Steve Davis. Davis, a ﬁve-year
quarterback after being red-
shirted, has never lost a game
while at the helm, amassing 1,260

-“Davis is definitely what ‘makes
the Sooners go,” according to Pitt
Assistant Coach Jackie ‘Sherrill.
“He makes excellent decisions,
pitcliesthe ball very well and is
mentally tough, which is what a
player has to be.”

Fullback in the Sooner wishbone

is a very important position when it
comes to running the ball. Against
Oregon the fullbacks picked up 250
of 400 rushing yards. Jim Littrell
was the main punch, gaining 117
yards. a

At the halfback slot Oklahoma is
indeed loaded to the gills. For
starters, how about Elvis Peacock?
Although only a sophomore,
Peacock (who played with Elliott
Walker in high school) probably
will start tomorrow against Pitt.

Behind him, Hqrace Ivory, who
had 117 yards on nine carries
against Oregon, is a somewhat
capable replacement.

For the past two years when
someone said Oklahoma, the name

‘Joe Washington came to the front.

And why not?

Last year as a junior Washington
rambled, rolled and leaped for
1,321 yards and 14 TDs.

This year “Slippery Joe” is
bidding for Steve Owens’ Big Eight
career rushing record and a little
statue called the Heisman, which
he lost last year to the kid from
Columbus, Archie something. I

“Joe Washington is without
doubt the best back we have ever
faced,” Sherrill said. “He’s got
maneuverability and ability to stop
on a dime and" move east and west
are his strong points.”

The offensive line is BIG, with
the guards averaging between 240
and 260 pounds.

However, 240 pounds might be
considered small when compared
to Mike “Battleship” Vaughn [6-5,
282 pounds], known affectionately
as the USS Vaughn. -

“Right now as a junior Vaughn is

He has dropped a total of one
pass in three years of varsity play.

As for the defense, it is just as
steady as the offense. The terrible
twins, Leroy and Dewey Selmon,
tackle and nose guard respectively,
collected over 100 tackles apiece
last year and will be counted on for
more of the same this year.

“Leroy Selmon is the best l’ve
seen in college and Dewey isn’t too
far behind,” said Pitt offensive line
coach Joe Avezzano.

Steelers Open Season  

I BY YAIER LEHRER

Saying the Pittsburgh Steelers
have been less than spectacular in
the
understatement of the year. The
Super.Bowl champs have looked
ineffective and sluggish on the
ﬁeld. If the Steelers perform
during the season as they have in
exhibition. they have as much
chance of making the playoffs as do
the Atlanta Braves.

The Steelers have to snap out of
whatever ails them before the
season opener ‘in San Diego this
weekend, for in no uncertain terms,
a win against the Chargers is a
must for Art Rooney’s club.

One of the things that will have

2%?-fro change for the Steelers to get

/ ,2

back on the winning track is the
performance of Terry Bradshaw. .
Chuck .Noll probably will have
Bradshaw at the offensive helm,
but if Bradshaw is as effective as he
has been so far, Joe Gilliam fans
could be in for a treat. The Great
Quarterback Controversy may have
a rerun this season.

Franco Harris is another ques-
tion mark. He has been playing
with injuries during the preseason
and is having problems making
sharp cuts,‘ making many Pitts-
burgh fans wonder if Franco ever
will return to the form he displayed
in his rookie year.

The Penn State alumnus saw
very little action_ in his second

season because of physical prob-

lems, and though he has retained
his great ability when itcomes to
the straightway run, he I cannot
make those turns the way he did
before the big layoff of two years
ago.

While the offense looks to
improve its preseason performance
(2-4, including a squeaker against
the College All-Stars), the defense
must plug up a big hole where a
middle linebacker used to be. Jack
Lambert will not be ready to play in
the opener. leaving the linebacking
chores to either Marv Kellum or Ed
Bradley.

Both Bradley and Kellum had a

his time on the bench. Happily for
Pittsburgh fans, Joe will be playing
against Don Woods and Company,
and will-help plug up what was a
very vulnerable middle at Texas
Stadium, although Steve Fumess
did turn in an admirable perfor-
mance in Greene’s place.

The defense will have a couple of
holes at middle linebacker and

against an over-age Dallas defense,
and could not mount a very
effective attach in the Steeler’ pro
win, against the New Orleans
Saints. _

“It’s not_ as if the material is
lacking. You might remember the
Pittsburgh Steelers are the reign-
ing Super Bowl champions and
very little has changed from last
year's squad, except the fact the
Steelers had a lot of momentum
riding from the preseason to the
regular season. It is this
momentum that they must pick up
against San Diego if they plan to
become two-time winners.

“Most of them."

Saturday’s tournament at Slip-

“The other members of the team
will be playing practice matches

Gordon breaks off to praise

“She’s got enough spirit for the

I ' 1 BY STEVE SYBERT

Carson Long is still kicking away,
and will be throughout this and
next season, yet already someone
is out to get him.

Freshman kicker Mark Schubert
insists that he and Carson are the
best of friends and that there is no
competition between them, but as
soon as Long leaves, his recor s,
some of which have yet to be set,
will begin to tumble down.

‘‘I’m setting my goals to be
better than Carson,” he said.
“He’s goingto set his records here
and I'm definitely going to try to
break them, but right now, there’s
no competition between us whatso-
ever.” .

Schubert said he owes a lot to
Long, who helps him improve his
kicking while accepting valuable

- -criticism in return. V.

“Carson is one of the reason
why I came here,” he said. “He’s
done a lot for me. I came to see

watches me and we compare what
we see.”

Several questions remain to be

2. Motivation. The simple fact
that the two schools are so close

practically shake hands with each
other) means the winner will have

believing it is the best in C
Pittsburgh. - . <~
3. Recognition. Pitt gained

recognition by the two great games
it played last week(the 1-0 loss to
Bucknell and the 0-0 tie against
Akron). A win for Point Park will
give it equal recognition, of not
more. It would be like Fresno
Beach U. beating Oklahoma in a
football game--it would obviously
appear somewhere in the Top 20
the very next week. L

The frightening thing about all
-this Point Park victory talk is that it
is not out of the realm of
possibility. The Pioneers have a
very fast, hard-nosed, quick-shoot-
ing offense commanded by out-

standing forward Boni Taylor--a"

player who can get through a whole‘
field full of defensemen--and a
number of West African players.

‘ The defense is not spectacular, but

reasonable-giving up 29 goals in
10 games.

Even though Point Park’s record
was only 5-4-1 last year, Pitt Coach

' Leo Bemis shows some concern.

“If they just had togetherness,
they could have been devastating,”
he reminisced. Maybe they gained
that missing link this year. 4
Whether Point Park is together
or not, a lot of pressure will be on
the Pitt defense again this week.

However, there is no reason 

worry yet, considering the Pan 1

thers have given up only one goal
in two games against much
stronger competition.

On the other hand, the offense is
a different story. In the same two
games, Pitt didn’t score a goal.
And so, Bemis plans to “make a
few changes”--mostly out of
necessity because of injuries and
sickness, but also because of other
mysterious reasons he did not wish
to discuss. He is hopeful these
changes will perk up a sleeping
offense that didn’t seem to fully
awaken in the two games last week.

So, no matter how you look at it,
the cross-town rivalry between Pitt
and Point Park at Pitt Stadium is
very intense.

Schubert Wants Chance

To Prove Worth

* (Continued from Page 9)

Carson, on the other hand, is_
accurate from inside 55 or 58 yards.
He still has about five yards on me.
"There’s no reason why he won’t
kick a 60-yard field goal. »
“I was kicking 40- and 45-yard
field goals and Carson touched up
my style and changed a few things
so I could improve on distance.”
Schubert will see limited action
(if any) with the varsity this season,
as would any player behind the guy
who could be the nation’s best
kicker. ,Yet Schubert says he’ll be
ready if his number is called.

“I think I could replace Carson at ‘

any instant in any given game,” he
said. “Pressure doesn’t bother me
at all. I like to kick under pressure.

Many placekickers, Schubert
feels, are out to glorify themselves
and don't think about the teams
playing in front of them. He
believes in giving credit where it is
due. ' ’

“Some kickers don’t play for the
team; they play for themselves.
They just, think about how many
points they're going to score,” he
said. “But I think 80% of the
actual field goal is dependent on
the holder and the center. They
have 1.2 seconds to put the ball
down exactly so the kicker can kick
it.”

Very studious when it comes to
his position, Schubert keeps a
notebook on the performances of all
National Football League kickers.
He is a fan of all the straight
kickers and feels those who kick

soccer-style ought to go back to
playing soccer.

“If you're a kicker and you kick
soccer-style after playing soccer all
your life, well...l don't think they
should be brought in ‘from other
countries. But I also think the
straight kickers are hurting and
only the good ones are going to
make it."

Schubert will be booting for the
JV squad when the young Panthers
open their season Monday at Pitt
Stadium against Youngstown.

‘‘I’m excited about kicking for
the .lVs because it’s very important
As for the future, my goal is to
become an All-America kicker and,
if I get red-shirted, I’m pretty sure
I will. I think that if you want
something bad enough, no matter
what it is, you can get it.”

Rivera has high hopes for the team.
~In this sport, teamwork is very
important. For the six field men to
get that ball into the net, a definite
disciplined strategy and a combin-
ation of brute force and firmness
from every player are needed.

To provide this conglomeration
of skills, the team has a number of
standouts. Luiz “Gordito” Tom is
a trick southpaw with great ball
handling; John Shepner and Bill
Wagner are noted for their
aggressive play; Dave Natali, Jerry
Demuro, Peque Rolan, Dennis
Herrington and Tom Dowd provide
the necessary speed needed in the
fast-paced game.

Despite what seems the end of
the world for the Pitt Panthers,
Oklahoma is not a team that can't

The Panthers’ "offensive back-
ﬁeld has been called by Sooner
Coach Barry Switzer as three Greg
Pruitts--a high compliment indeed.

“Those three men in the Pitt

we have.”

Certainly the defense won’t be a
match in physical size for OU, but it
will be very quick and mobile, a
definite plus. _ I
