Shift in ideology
divides Honors College

Aaron Stier-Cohen
Staﬁ Writer

In early April of her senior year in
high school, Naomi Latorraca came
to interview at Pitt for the Chancel-
lor’s Scholarship, one of Pitt’s most
prestigious awards, which is offered
through the University Honors Col-
lege. 7

Pitt was her backup school. But a
full ride through college is apowerﬁil
incentive, so she decided to start the
interviewprocess forthe scholarship.

Latorraca said what drew her to
the UHC was her initial interview.

“When I came to the interview,
they started it off by asking the ques-
tion of ‘Do you think that an honors
college or any institutionforthat mat-
ter should offer merit scholarships?” ’

It was an awkward question to
answer for someone applying for a
merit-based scholarship, so Latorraca
was taken aback.

At the time, Mike Giazzoni and

V Nate Hilberg were the academic ad— T

visers for the UHC, and it was their
job to interview potential Chancellor
Scholars.

,“They asked me then about an es-
say I had written, which was about
a scientiﬁc paradigm shift, and we
talked about that,” Latorraca said. “I
had really never talked to people, like
to adults about ideas and my own writ-
ing in an in—depth way, and that was
something I did get to do with Mike
and Nate.” A

The advisers questioned Latorraca S

thoroughly, forcingher to defend her
position and asking her to consider
other perspectives. Soon Latorraca
had forgotten she was there for an
interview and became immersed in
the conversation. p
They spoke foranhourandahalf,
and at the end, Latorraca received a
book, “The Two Cultures” by C.P.

Snow.

“I felt that the point of the inter-
viewwas to introduce me to this depth
of collegiate learning that could hap-
pen,” Latorraca said. “I came to Pitt
because of that interview.”

Latorraca soon found herself in a

1 community of informal learning and

interdisciplinary discussion among

students. She grew to love the mess

of newspapers, books, coffee and
ideas that waited for her on the 35th
and 36th ﬂoors of the Cathedral of
Learning.

Nowasenior at Pin.‘ and amember
of the UHC Advisory Board, a group
of undergraduates responsible for
representing student interest to the
dean of the UHC, Latorraca said the
community she discovered as afresh-
man was not created accidentally. In-
stead, the instituu'on’s belovedfound-
ing dean, Alec “Doc” Stewart, created
and emphasized programming that
resulted in a forum forstudents to
express ideas and explore intellectu-
ally together.

But Latorraca said she feels the
space forunbound intellecuial curios-
ity slipping away and worries it won’t
be there for ﬁiture students to enjoy.

Both Hilberg and Giazzoni no lon-
ger work in the UHC, and Latorraca

said thatwith the decreasing number
of students meeting for impromptu
discussions, she has no problem ﬁnd-

' ing a quiet place to study at the top of

the Cathedral.

These changes worry Latorraca,
and she’s not alone.

The Pittsburgh Port Author-
ity made routine changes to 17 of
its bus schedules Sunday. These
changes occur four times a year
in March, June, September and
November.

Schedules for buses including
the 13 Bellevue, 26 Chartiers, 27
Fairywood, 29 Robinson, 71 Edge-
wood, P86 Braddock Hills Flyer,
P71 Swisshelm vPark—Rankin Flyer,
Y1 Flyer, Y45 Baldwin Manor,F1yer,
Y47 Curry Flyer and Y49 Prospect
Park Flyer, saw adjusted trip times.

Heather Pharo, a spokeswoman
for Port Authority, explained that
these small changes are known as
“running time adjustments” and

are consistently early or late.

Some bus routes gained trips or
increased their frequency. The 87
Friendship, 86 Liberty, 61D Mur-
ray and Y46 Elizabeth Flyer routes
increased their frequency during
the busiest travel times.

“On a lot of our routes, our
greatest demand is during rush
hour times,” Pharo explained. C

She also described the way in

. which Port Authority determines

what bus schedules to alter.
“We do this based on observa-
tions and data,” Pharo said.

Port Authority uses informa— -

tion collected from automated pas-
senger counters, which keep track
of riders as they board and depart
from the bus, and from fare boxes
on each vehicle. Although they do
not yet have real-time GPS technol-

GPS systems after the fact to make
decisions regarding schedules.

Rider and driver feedback

during these periods of schedule

revision.

During this time, bus drivers

to as “picks,” and in November,
they go through an additional type

UHC

Edward Stricker, the dean of the Univer-
sity Honors College, wants to provide the
UHC academic experience to more under-
grads. Luv Purohit l Assistant Visual Editor

1 November 19, 2012 l The Pitt News lvvvvvv.pittn.ews.com

believe Stn'cker’s policies have shifted UHC em-
phasis away from the intellectual curiosity that
Stewart emphasized.-

Vice Provostjuan Manfredi said he approves
of Stricker’s initiatives and that the students’
passion is misplaced. . ‘

“[Intellectual curiosity] is a great thing, but
that is something that Alec invented to motivate
students,” Manfredi said. “He had a fantastic

‘ personality,amagneticpersonalitygandhewould

ﬁgure outways to motivate students . .. but on the
other hand, thatis notaplan for the University.”

Building onanidea ,

In 1986 Pitt’s Board of Trustees established
the University Honors College as it exists today.
Ina1987 address, Stewart said the UHCwas cre-
ated as a place where students could pursue high
academic attainment for its own sake.

In the more than 25 years since its found-
ing, the UHC has sought to achieve this goal
through many programs, includingthe Bachelors
ofPhilosophy Degree, the Brackenridge program
through which undergraduates defend their
research to a group of their peers, honors hous-
ing and many other scholarships and awards.

Pitt’s UHC differs from other honors colleges
across the country in that it has no membership
—-— as organizers often explain it, no one is “in”
the Honors College. Instead, the UHC, according

to the website, exists to serve the “most able”
Pitt students, but the decision of who is “most
able” is left largely up to students. Students can

apply to the majority of the UI-I_C’s programs at

any point in their college career.

Honors courses have a minimum GPA re-
quirement for enrollment, but that prerequi-
site is often adjusted for students who display
abilities in other areas. The UHC has its own
programs council, the StudentHonors Activities
Council, which organizes lecture series, forrnals
and even ﬂag football.

In 2010, the Honors College met an un-
precedented challenge when its founding dean
unexpectedly passed away. Dean Steve Husted
took over as interim dean until May 2011 when,
after a process that lasted more than a year, the
search committee foundanew permanent clean
in snicker; a neuroscience professor known for
his intelligence, successful teaching style and
investment in students.

Stricker said his goal as dean of the UHC is
to provide an education that is broad and deep,
to encourage students to explore the curriculum
and themselves, and to teach students to be gen-
erous. He said thathis,No. lconcern since taking
over leadership of the Honors College injuly 2011
has been increasing student participation and
expanding the honors community.

 

“Twenty—ﬁve years ago, when the UHC 
founded, there were not nearly as large [a] num-
ber of accomplished undergraduate students on
campus as there are today,” Stricker said in an
email. “So in a sense, we are entering a second"
phase in the role of the UHC in the University,
one that is characterized by an eiqaanding role
in providing an outstanding academic experi-
ence to an expanded number of undergraduate
students who want it.” 1

According to Stricker, many students and
faculty don’t know that UHC courses and activi-
ties are open to any undergraduate who applies.
An aspect particular to Pitt’s honors college is
students’ ability to choose their own level of in-
volvement. Someone who participates in one
book club is just as much a member as a Chan-
cellor Scholar involved in three honors courses
and the Brackenridge program.

“It is sad when I think that so many students
at Pittwho might beneﬁt greatly from participat-
ing in the UHC, and contribute greatly as well,
do not do so because they believe they are not
members of the UHC,” Stricker said. —

Although his selection was at first met with
the enthusiastic support of many students who
had known him as ateacher, Striker’s leadershipi

criticism than praise. A considerable number of
students are worried thatwith Striker’s increased
push for academic initiatives, the UHC’s found-
ingvalues — those emphasized under Stewart’s
leadership —— are disappearing.

“Intellectual community is what has drawn
people to Pitt in the past and allowed them to
succeed,” Latorraca said. “My worryforthe Hon-
ors College is that it will no longer be a place
for creativity and informal achievement and
instead, just become a place for your average
overachiever.” «

A commitment to curiosity

Around rnid-September, eight students
signed a letter to Stricker expressing similar
concerns. They centered on ‘a speciﬁc phrase
that Stewart often mentioned, which has since
become somewhat of a rallyingcryfor students
frustrated with what they see as the current direc-
tion of the Honors College.

Senior Tom Viscowas one studentwho signed
the letter. He explained this core value.

“I thinkthe Honors College has one primary
principle —- that is intellectual curiosity” he said.
“That’s the vision thatwas sold to me when Iwas
a younger student.”

In the letter to Striker, the students stated, .

i “For us, the promise of an institution that pro-
motes intellectual curiosity as its core value is
what made the choice to come to Pitt so easy 
Nonetheless, we are deeply concerned that the
value of intellectual curiosity is being de-em-

phasized at the service of achievement-orjientect

principles.” .

The letter also cited limits on funding for
book clubs, propositions to dissolve the Student
Honors Activity Council, staff turnover, the ad-
dition of a health professions advising staff and
the possibility of a pre—law advising staff to fol-
law all as departures from the UHC’s focus on
intellectual curiosity.

“[Health professions] advising represents
something antithetical to what the Honors Col-
lege has long espoused,” Latorraca said. “The
Honors College exists to protect a minority of
educational values, intellectual curiosity as a
means for individual intellectual attainment.
By bringing in status quo types of education,
we really are, in a sense, polluting this special

principle   so many students to Pitt .

Accordingto seniorAlex Zimmerman, Strick-

er’s thinking emphasizes academic achievement
for the sake of accomplishment, not growth. 

“It treats the end goal as  merit

“If you bring people who are interested in
performingacademically and answertheir ques-
tions, but also say ‘here [are some other oppor-
tunitjes] ,’ our hope and expectation is that some
of these students will take advantage of some
of those opportunities,” Stricker said. “What I
want to do is open up the Honors College, and
ifthere is asense thatl amletting in newpeople,
that is correct.”
Continued opposition
In mid-September senior James Simkins
founded the Pitt Honors Collegein Exile Face-
book group as away of promoting student activ-
isminresponse to the changes happening inthe
UHC. He said that reducing book club ﬁinding
and hiring two new health professions advisers
shows a clear emphasis on traditional student
achievement ratherthan intellectual exploration.
, “Book clubs are important because they are
one [of the] main ways inwhichindividuals who

are active in the Honors College come together]

into a community,” he said.

Simkins was on good terms with Stricker
throughoutthebeginningofStricker’s positionas
dean. Stricker spoke with Simkins about speciﬁc
UHC policy, and the two voiced their differing
visions for the UHC."

But in November of 2011, Simkins decided
Stricker did not understand his concerns.

“We hadasubstantialtalkabout differences,”
Simkins said of that last meeting. “I came out of
that conversation convinced thatthere were not
going to be changes.”

Simkins told WPTS radio in late September
thathe would not recommend Pitttohisyounger
brother because of the trend he sees.

Stricker has since said that the new SAT re-
quirement will drop back to 1450 for incom-
ing Chancellor’s Scholars next year and has
expressed his support for the dissolvement of
the SHAC.

Simpkins points to these missteps as ex-
amples of Stricker’s lack of vision. _

“I don’t think [Stricker] has a broad philo-
sophical plan  I think he never really learned
whatthe old [Honors] Collegewas,’-’ Simkins said.

Simkins started his Facebook page around the

‘ same time that the group ‘of students sent their

letter. In his group notes section, he raises many

. of the same concerns described in the letter.

“I started the_UHC in Exile because students
who believed in Doc’s values needed a way to
respond to the ‘changes in the Honors College
and mourn the loss of the old Honors College,”
Simkins said. _ A

As of publication, his group has online sup-
portfrom morethan27 people. -,

Visco said that he thinks Simkins’ views are
somewhat extreme. However, he also said that
while he and others maintain hope, ﬁirther dia-
logue might prevent some unwanted change
—- they are just unclear about how much of an
impact they have. . *

“It’s unclear how our opinions and our advice
translate into policy decisions,” VlSCO said.

Accordingto Visco, Stricker often expresses
understandingforthe Advisory Board’s concerns
but does not act on them. -

“I thinkthere is adifference between coming
tous rhetorically and comingtous substantively.

UHC Q

We haven’t seen any evidence that the rhetorical
shift has led to a policy shift.”

Late last month, Zimmerman armounced
his resignation from the Advisory Board after
promotional materialforthe new G. Alec Stewart
Student Achievement Award, an award given
annually to four students who take advantage of
UHC opportunities, failed to mention intellectual
curiosity as a “primary value.” ‘

“As far as I can tell,” Zimmerman said in his -

resignation letter, “we all agreed that intellectual

curiosity ought to be of paramount importance

when selecting awardees  Yet, intellectual cu-
riosity goes unmentioned as a primary value
in any of the promotional literature about the
award. Instead, it is labeled ‘a favorite phrase of
Dean Stewart’s.”’ .

Accordingto Zimmerman, the UHC’s website
has since been updated. While heis gladhis resig-

nation prompted some action, he said he worries _

what will happen when there are students who

no longer care enough to mention changes they '

disagree with.

“There is a certain amount of institutional
memory that is being lost at a rapid rate,” Zim-
merman said. “Two important people are gone
[Hilberg and Giazzoni] , and soon no one will be
leftwho knew what the old Honors College was.”

But according to Stricker, Pitt is changing,
and the UHC must keep pace.

Dr. Lewisjacobson attended Amherst College
in Massachusetts with Stewart and has worked at
Pitt since 1967. He said Stewart based the UHC
on the community they had as undergraduates.

“At some level, Alec had a mental model that
was built on his own undergraduate experience

that was built on his time at a small liberal arts ,

college,”]acobson said.

Jacobson said that the model was necessary _

for Pittwhen many of its students were commut-
ers and student achievementwas lower. But times
are different and things change, Jacobson said,
and Stewart knew that.

“He was a humble man,” Jacobson said of
Stewart. “I don’t think he would ever have left a
lastwill and testament to the UHC. ‘You guyswill
ﬁgure it out,’ that was his attitude.”

Liberty, Collier and Ross.
Only one bus, the P12 Holiday Park Flyer,

lost trips. Two morning inbound trips and -

one outbound evening trip were discon-
tinued. _

Pharo explained that threats of larger
service reductions have been looming since
as early as last March, but Port Authority has
been able to put these on hold.

According to an article published last
summer in The Pitt News, in recent years,
Port Authority has faced cuts to its state
appropriation. Most recently it had to ﬁnd

ways to cope with a $64 million deﬁcit in
the 2012-2013 operating budget}-?';I‘he trans-
portation organization was able to prevent
cuts to its services this year by ﬁnding rev-
enue streams aside from that of the state
government.

Students at Pitt, such as sophomore nurs-
ing major Leanna Rose, rely heavily on Port
Authority buses to get around.

“I take [the bus] at least once a week. It’s
convenient,” Rose said.

She frequently takes the 61 and 71 buses
to the T station Downtown in order to go
home. _ l L

Because people rely on the bus system,
Port Authority goes to great lengths to in-
form the public about these alterations.

“Any time you make changes, some peo-

Tisht 0nTime?      
  Tighter onCasln?

ple will like them, and some won’t. We have a
variety of ways to tell people about changes,
but I’m sure some people still slip through
the cracks,” Pharo said.

Port Authority lists all service changes on
its website, portauthority.org, and also tries
to reach riders through its Twitter account,
its blog and a wire alert on its mobile site.

_ It also takes care to inform those rid-
ers who might not have access to the web
through posters at the Service,Center, where
bus passes are available for purchase, and
signs on the interior of the buses themselves.

Pharo emphasizedthe importance of
checking bus schedules before heading out
to a stop.

“We want to make sure everyone gets
their buses,” she said. I

out as Iwent along. I
It has been a lot of work, but it is a
decision I am grateful to have made.
The Honors College works in a
similar manner. The members of the
Honors College don’t need to meet
certain criteria to be considered
members; there isn’t a set path. This
is because, unlike institutions such
as the Schreyer Honors College at
Penn State, the UHC doesn’t really
have members. You can take hon-
ors classes, participate in reading
groups or live in honors housing, but

no set criteria makes you  accred-
ited honors student. The degree that
the UHC does offer, the Bachelor of

1 Philosophy, neither‘ conﬁrms your

honors status nor excludes others
from being considered members.
Instead, the UHC. is just a mind-
set. Not a groupthinkcreed that
members murmur to themselves
ritualistically, but simply a broader

' way of thinking about yourselflas a

student. V

At Pitt, this mindset is, “I’ll work
harder on something I want to learn
abou ,” and students then go the ex-

tra mile to gain some deeper under~
standingbn a subject that interests
them. As Stewart used to say, it was
about doing more in service of “life
above the neck.” ,

- If this sounds comically high-
minded, in some ways it'is. Essen-
tially, the UHC is funded and justiﬁed
because it creates an environment
through speciﬁc classes and groups
in which students can pursue subject
matter as they see ﬁt, without the

‘ guarantee of long—ter1n beneﬁt.
This means that the UHC can ,
‘fund reading groups such as Pizza

and Proust and Donuts and Dysto—
pias. Students might spend months
working on a thesis on topics rang-
ing from Internet meme culture to
Duke‘Ellington’s relationship to Er-
nest Hemingway. Biology and the
philosophy of biology are studied
hand in hand. ,-

But for such a high—minded, al-
most fanciful group to work, there
needs to be a strong element of so-
cial cohesion. Getting people to work
together and also for themselves on

behalf of these fuzzy ideals requires
ﬁrm guidance. But rules specifying
X number of classes or Y advising
appointments don’t accomplish this
end; instead, a simple unifying ethos
is all that is required.

For years, Stewart embodied this
ethos. When the search began for
his replacement, most candidates,
including current Dean Edward
Stricker, talked about the importance
of maintaining this ideal. Everybody

l recognized the importance of the

spirit of the Honors College.
However, something has gone
wrong, as you can see in the paper
today. Be it through short sighted-
ness, attention focused elsewhere
or honest misunderstandings, this
ethos now shows signs of decay. A
new focus on medical school advis-
ing has added increased pressure to
do things that will simply increase
the quality of applications, possibly
pushing aside more solely intellectu
pursuits. ‘ P
Moreover, with a shift toward the
biological‘-sciences, there has been
a Stratiﬁcation in regard to the per-
ceived quality of academic pursuits.
While most philosophy majors will
quickly acknowledge that they face
tougher job prospects, it would at
one time have beenconsidered in
poor taste to denigrate an entire dis-

cipline solely because of employment
potential. Although there is no open

mocking, according to complaints .

from the group “Honors College in
Exile” and anecdotes I have heard
from this summer’s Brackenridge
presentations, the former culture of

academic equality seems to be slowly 1

fading away.

 But most importantly, any organi-
zation built solely on social cohesion
faces an evident crisis when some
core advisershave left. With the re-
cent departure of Mike Giazzoni, a
former UHC adviser and program
coordinator,.the community has lost
four pillars in thepast two years.

Any organization, be it private or
public, caxmot not subsist through
social stability if this many people
are leaving.‘ .

Dean Stricker should not be ﬁred.
Nor should he be solely blamed for
the new problems. Few expectedthis
social dynamic to be as critical as it
has turned out to be.

But administrators at the Honors
College need to acknowledge that the

core of a group without any formal ;

rules is ideological substance and so-
cial cohesion. Maintainingthis spirit
is the key to saving the UHC.

Repairing the fault lines will not
be easy, but I think Stewart’s advice
most aptly applies here: Just keep
trying harder. I

To the Editor, I

In regard to Eric Baldwin’s col-
umn at the beginning of this month,
advocating for a larger government
is a frightening thought considering

the federal government’s spending _

already exceeds 24 percent of the
economy. But this is not to say our
competent government was not

A hard at work. In the last year gov-

ernment oﬂicials created more than
3,500 new regulations that will cost
American families and businesses

‘LETTER TO THE EDITOR

‘$46 billion in compliance costsl

Earely do we see creativity or in-
novation birthed by a government
bureaucracy. Yet it is exactly these
types of creative activities that are
required to grow the economy and
create j obs. While I agree a reason-
able amount of regulation is nec-
essary to avoid “cutting corners,”
the free market is the best way to
regulate its competition for reputa-
tion. If you’re not doing solid work
for your clients, they are not going
to continue to use your services or

recommend your company.
When the government" takes
money away" from businesses
. (higher taxes) to fund government
' programs, the private sector be-
comes smaller and has fewer jobs.
History proves the public sector
is less productive with funds than
the private sector. The unemploy-
ment numbers are higher when the
government is larger. This suggests

_a path toward shrinking govern:
'ment and marginal tax rates in or-

der to, once again, grow our way

out of this mess. President Barack.
Obama wants to raise the income
tax rate for anyone earning more
than $250,000 a year, but this
isn’t just the “fortunate folks,” —
it’s small businesses, our lifeline
for jobs. Federal regulations cost
small businesses about 36 percent
more per employee to comply than
their big—business counterparts.
But the Obama administration
approved 129 signiﬁcant federal
rules (those costing the economy
more than-$100 million) during

the president’s ﬁrst 33 months in
ofﬁce. Compare this with only 90
approved regulations from former
President George W. Bush and 115
for former President Bill Clinton
during their 4 years. Our nation did '
not get where We are today because
of the government. We earned our
wealth despite the government.

 MEN’S BASKETBALL

Left for dead, Pitt comes back to win  

Jasper Wilson
“r ‘ Asszstam‘ Sports Editor

As the second half of the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball game unfolded Saturday night, it
looked as though the team would suffer

its ﬁrst loss of the season.

Facing Oakland at the Petersen Events
Center, the Panthers trailed by as much as

18 in the second half.

And then, with the outcome of the
game seemingly a forgone conclusion,

they fought back.

1,, After trailing for close to 34 minutes of
the contest, last leading when the score
was 9-7 in the ﬁrst half, the Panthers tied
the game with 10 seconds left on a pair of

James Robinson free throws.

In overtime, Pitt (4-0) would outscore
the Golden Grizzlies 14-4 and go on to

win 72-62 in a dumbfounding comeback.

Pitt played sloppy basketball up until

it surged to a sudden victory.

Redshirt senior guard Tray Woodall
exempliﬁed this drastic change from the

team’s earlier performances this season.

4.». He ﬁnished the game with a meager six
points on 2-14 shooting, his worst offen-
sive output this season. He wasn’t alone

in that respect.

“We didn’t shoot well at all, we didn’t

defend well at all, but one thing this

team did was ﬁght,” Woodall said. “And

it showed a lot of character.”

Down by such a large deﬁcit, the at-
tempt to erase it had to be gradual. Wood-
all said the overarching message among,

the team was one of patience.

“Keep trying to cut it down,” he said.

'-.=: “We can’t make it [back in] one play.”

As Pitt’s efforts came to a head, an un-
characteristic error by the team’s fresh-
man point guard threatened to make it

all for naught.

Robinson turned the ballover before

7, '5 he ended up extending the game.

“Well, [the last sequence of regulation]

all started when I travelled,” Robinson
said. “And then after that, I was feeling
kind of bad, so I ﬁgured the only way I
can make up for it is with a play on the

defensive end.”

a

‘w Coming out of a timeout, Robinson
stole the ball from Oakland point guard
Duke Mondy, who fouled him immediately.
This set up the opportunityafor Pitt to tie

the score.

”.J“I was pretty calm,” Robinson said.
“Ijust stepped to the line and made the

free throws.”

Head coach Jamie Dixon praised his

budding ﬂoor general.

“He’s got a sense of maturity that’s be-

yond his years both physically and men-
tally,” he said. “He made very few mental
mistakes, [which is] so valuable.”

3 In scoring 14 points, Robinson was the
Panther’s second—leading scorer behind
junior_]._]. Moore, who ﬁnished with 16.

After the game, Oakland head coach-

Greg Kampe was blunt about the outcome.
“We should’ve won the game,” Kampe

said. “There’s no one in this room that can r

tell me we shouldn’t have. For 37 minutes
we were by far the best team on the ﬂoor.
The last three minutes, I don’t know what
happened. We kind of collapsed.”

With three and a half minutes to go in
the ﬁrst half, the Grizzlies (1-3) went on
an 8-0 run to end the period, making the
score 34-20. Oakland guard Travis Bader
punctuated the run with back—to—back
3-pointers", which deﬂated the raucous
crowd. ' ’

Oakland’s dominance in the ﬁrst half
was widespread. It owned a 20-8 points-
in-the-paint difference and scored 12
points off nine Pitt turnovers, whereas
Pitt managed a mere three points off seven

But something’s missing.

The Pittsburgh Penguins should be play-
ing the Washington Capitals in just a few
minutes. Instead, the National Hockey
League remains locked out, and the stale-
mate of a labor dispute between the play-
ers’ union and the teams’ owners continues
to drain sales.

For Palombine’s Souper Bowl and sever-
al other bars and restaurants located near
Consol Energy Center -— the Penguins’
home arena — this lockout spells disaster.

“Tonight I might close the bar at 8 or
9 o’clock,” said Palombine, a junior at
Duquesne University. “If there’s a Pens
game, we’re here until at least 2 a.m.”

This lockout is the league’s third in 19
years, the most recent one occurring dur-
ing the 2004-2005 season. Hope remains
that this lockout won’t lead to another lost
season, as was the case previously. How-
ever, Commissioner Gary Bettman recently
canceled all games throughjan. 1, 2013.

New Year’s Day traditionally marks
the annual NHL Winter Classic, when two
teams compete at an outdoor venue. This
year, the Detroit Red Wings and the To-
ronto Maple Leafs were slated to play at
Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. But that
game won’t be played either.

The bars and restaurants that depend
heavily on the revenue generated from
hockey games have taken drastic mea-
sures to remain proﬁtable. Most employ
a smaller staff, which affects many student
workers.

 

“Hockey night we’ll have six or seven

servers upstairs, and we’ll have three bar-
tenders up here. Downstairs we’ll have two
bartenders, four servers. We’ll have a full
cooking staff,” Palombine said.
Palombine isn’t the only student facing

shorter hours because of the dispute.

, Pete Oliver, owner of Café Fifth, located
a half block from the Consol Energy Center
and ' a couple doors down from Souper
Bowl, said he had to cut about 10 to 12
people from his staff.

“Many of them are college students.
They’re students that live around here so
they don’t have to worry about going home
at Thanksgiving or Christmas,” Oliver said.

Management at a T.G.I. Friday’s located
next to the Consol Energy Center chose
not to comment on the situation.

Palombine said that he’s seen a tremen-
dous decrease in his hours, which directly

’ translates to a drop in pay.

“During the hockey season I’ll make
anywhere from two to three grand a
month. You’re working two to three hours

dollars a game,” Palombine said.

Souper Bowl has initiated a Bubble
Hockey League tournament Monday
nights, complete with drink specials. But
Palombine said it won’t generate nearly
enough revenue to cover what the restau-
rant and bar are losing. He estimates that
actual hockey games account for at least
60 percent of business.

For Oliver, Pens games account for
about one-third of his business, and he
said there’s not much he can do in the way
of specials or promotions to compensate.

“Who’s going to come down here for
a $2 beer? I have no foot traffic without
hockey,” Oliver said.

Though students working in ‘the Down-
town service industry might be suffering
losses, one business is thankful to have

 Duquesne students to fall back on.
 .  .,Milano’s Pizzeria, located about a block
, up‘ from the arena, is lagging without hock-

ey but remains aﬂoat in otzger ways.
“Now that Duq_uesne’s  we’re not
hurting as bad. Thank goodness that we

deliver,” said Terrie'Rihm, a cashier and t A if

bartender at Milano’s. 4 4 V _
Milano’s has six locatio,nsq¢.through‘ , ,

revenue without hockey. _  v

“This location relies rnostfon hockey
and Duquesne University,” Rihm said.
“We’re working less, we’re making less.

The rich get richer, the poor suffer.”

A hockey fan and English writing major

' at Pitt, junior John Lavanga can relate to
'Rihm’s frustration and also feels disgusted
before a game and two to three hours after 
a game, and you’re making 200 to 300 

 

Lavanga said.

In the battle between players and own-
ers, Lavanga empathizes with the players.

“I tend to usually come down on the
side of the players. Given that Gary Bett-
man’s been bragging about recordproﬁts
through the years, it doesn’t really, make
sense to root for the owners,” Lavanga
said.

As a Pitt student, Lavanga said he’s at-
tended three or four games through the
student rush program but also listens to
coverage of his favorite team, the Vancou-
ver Canucks, on the radio through the NHL
mobile application.

“I ﬁgured we couldn’t be as bad [in the
second half] as we were in the ﬁrst half,”
he said. ‘You just keep battling.”

Pitt had never come back from greater
than 13 points at the half in program his-
tory, but the Panthers bucked that trend
Saturday night.

With 11 and a half minutes left, the Pan-
thers went on a 28-10 run spanning the
rest of regulation, culminating in Robin-
son’s free throws. And the Oakland Zoo,

lation.

a couple plays like that coming off the

chemical engineering major Robert Wal-
lace became a hockey fan five years ago,
and his fanhood for the Penguins has
grown ever since. He’s disappointed to
see his favorite sport go away for a while
but is ﬁnding other ways to feed his sports
interests.

“Hockey certainly helped keep me
balanced. My ‘one consolation is, Evgeni
Malkin is playing really well in Mettalurg,
[Russia]. He’s putting up more than a point
a game,” said Wallace, referring to the star
Penguin’s success on his new team in the
Kontinental_Hockey,League. '

“Also, I’ve been watching a lot more
English Premier League soccer. That’s sort
of my second favorite sport?" Wallace said.

Lavanga enjoys taking in hockey from
a home setting, whereas Wallace said he’ll
deﬁnitely go to a bar for the big games.

“I’d be more likely to go to'Hemingway’s
or Unclejimmy’s. It’s a super yinzer crowd.
You get thepeople who are actually Pens
fans,” Wallace said. 1

Contrary to the management at Down-
town spots, owners and managers at sev-
eral Oakland bars seemed mostly uncon-
cerned with the prospect of a canceled or
limited season. .

Kevin Connolly, owner of Bootleggers
on Semple Street, said, “We really notice
an inﬂux more towards the playoffs. Hope-
fully it’ll get resolved and not affect the
whole season.”

The new setup at Bootleggers, which
includes front windows that openedup
space and contributed to the bar’s in-
creased popularity among students, could

   

also play a role in how the lockout might _

affect the bar.

Referring to the 2004-2005 lockout,
Connolly said, “I don’t think it really af-
fected us all that much, probably a little bit.
Now, with the new setup, it would probably
be more.” ’

,» John Elavsky, the owner of Heming— V

way’s, another student-frequented bar
on Forbes Avenue, sees business through
means other than ‘hockey. When asked if

the lockout could hurt business, Elavsky :

V said, “No, it won’t, particularly in October,
November, December. We’ve got a lot more
-things going on. Certain games would draw
a pretty big group of fans for that night,

but it’s not a big deal. Playoff time will hurt ,

for sure. In April, we’ll miss that.” -

He insisted that Hemingway’s will man- 4

age well and instead, is worried about the
bars that rely on hockey more than his.

“I feel really bad for the places Down— A
town and for the other venues across the .

country and across the NHL that really

depend on that to carry them through,” ‘

Elavsky said. '
