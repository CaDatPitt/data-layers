Committee Sets Goal 9

At Two Dollars a Head

A The Pitt Chest campaign opens fourth hour today with
its biggest push for funds to support 100 charitable agencies‘,
in the coming year. . ' ' ‘ _

Student and faculty speakers will present the Chest’s case
before fourth hour classes in all schools of the University,
and appeal, for a contribution of $2 from every Pitt student.

' Campaign Slogan I » g
e ‘ Campaigning by the slogan “Our ‘aim is two dollars from f
all Pitt scholars,” the Chest committee has emphasized that 1
students who do not wish to contribute in the classrooms may
instead pledge any amount, t_o be paid later, at the Student
Desk. . . . I -

In order to reach students-not scheduled in today’s fourth
hour classes, Chest speakers will also make appeals in third
hour classes tomorrow. , '   ;

The Student Desk will take contributions all day Friday.. .

. A contribution or pledge of $2 during classroom solicita-
tions will qualify the donor for admission tolthe Chest’s all- ,
student dance at the YM&WHA Saturday evening.

A Better The "Goal .

9 Chest drive chairman Ronald Ecker stressed that “al- _»_
though $2 is our minimum goal, we hope that those -students
who can’t afford that much, will donate as much as they are
able.” , -‘
A contribution of $2 will provide the Pitt Chest 100 mem-, 
ber agencies -with 2 cents each. The Pitt Chest contributes to 
eight agencies, two of which are on the Pitt camp'us, in addi-
tion to the 92 serviced by the Community Chest.

. . To Service Groups .

Money from students will go to the Men’s Loan Fund and I

the Women’s Loan Fund on campus, and to the R-ed Cross,

March of Dimes, CARE, United Negro College Fund’, world

Student‘ Service Fund, and United Negro -Scholarship Fund,
as well as to the 92 Community Chest agencies. 9

In recognition of the Chest’s promotion of religious and
racial tolerance, today’s Heinz Chapel speaker, the Rev. Frank,
Hutchison, will relate the Chest’s efforts in,_,tho,se lines. Chape
service gets underway at 1 p.m. '

Engineers Want More
Space, less Red Tape

By CLARK SUTTON
The chorus of mixed voices chanting “We want more

buildings” has added a bass section in the form of the stu-——

dents of the School of Engineering and Mines.

, One glance around the engineering labs is proof enough ,
that this part of the Universityneeds. more thanthe ordinary {

amount of space. Closely resembling the General Motors

production line, the labs consist of giant machinery, and"
_over-sized electrical panels. which give the impression that
.they contain enough current to electrify the whole city.

In this atmosphere of modern industry, with it’s pun-
gent, oily smell, the future engineers struggle with prob-
and other complicated questions.

. . Good Labs
“We’ve got some of the ﬁnest lab equipment in the ‘coun-

.. try,” several students remarked, “and no place to put it.”
-They feel, however, that the situation has improved in the
; past few years, and they are awaiting anxiouslythe comple-
;tion of the Clapp Engineering building adjacent to the Ca-
thedral. It will mean that Pitt students will have one of.
_.the most complete engineering schools in the country. ’.
_ , Which is, of course, only. ﬁtting for one of the oldest 1
engineering. schools in the country, and the ﬁrst west of

the Alleghenies. Here in industrial Pittsburgh, the ﬁrst en-

‘. gineering degree was granted in 1846’, and the Department 

.' of Engineering was formally established as part of the Uni-

versity in the ‘early 1860’s.
 C The School of Mines-was established by an act of the’
"State Legislature on July 5’, 1895 in order to educate young"
jmen in “the principles and art of mining‘ and _mining en-
~ gineering.” B i

Pitt's Orphans

Despite the great past of the school, however, a large?

number of students feel that they have become “the or-
phans of the University.” They are unable to reason, so
they -say, ‘Why they don’t get more money for buildings

.when money is available. “Instead,” several remarked, “the

money goes for that,” pointing to the nearly-completed Field
House. - i ~
“Of course we want a. ‘Field House,” they stated,‘ “but

buildings of that ,nature_are secondary in importance at a,
University.”

A standard question asked the students in these inter-

-'views was, “What suggestions do you have for improve-
'ment?”‘ Oddly enough, the majority of the future engineers
did not suggest improvement in some ﬁeld of their particu-

lar department, but rather focused their attention on a Uni-

. versity wide problem——registration.

Called a Waste

Described as “a mess,” “the worst part of the school,”
‘a . o -
— and “a I‘1d1CulOU.S waste of time,’’ the engineers offered con-

crete suggestions on how to speed up and simplify the prob-

. , lem of registration.

Asked Why the engineers were the ﬁrst to raise’ the
problems of registration, they replied, “After all, we’re be-

"ing trained to simplify and modernize, and can you think

of anything that needs to be more modernized than regis-

4‘ Worth y Dance

During the fourth hour, today those of us who have
n _ classes‘ will listen to representatives-of the Pitt Chest. These
~ ‘speakers will attempt to get across to us the aims of the
drive and the reasons for its existence.

Each of us must then decide whether the aims and
‘reasons are worthy of our two dollar contribution. _It is
'--something which we ‘will decide as individuals.

But, regardless of the conclusion we come to, the situ-
ations "which cause such a drive" as the Pitt Chest will con"-'
.tinue to exist. There will still be people faced with pover-
fty, lacking in ‘health services, without homes and without

security. _ « ' ,. _i , . i
_ .~The — two dollars which we contribute’ will do much
-to relieve these conditions. By way ‘of compensation the
two ‘dollars will admit us to an all-student dance on Sat-
1 1ir.daY.,nisht- ' . » . . C . ~

. year. - —. .

- Dr.~~Witz brought to his subject a feeling which inspired
interest in the most casual of undergraduates.' He breathed
life into a subject which usually appeals only to the special-
ized student. . , '

In the 23 years Dr. Witz spent here he earned the re- ‘
spect of his fellow faculty members, the honor of those
. ; in his chosen ﬁeld and the affection of his students.‘ It is
unfortunate that he could not stay longer.-

To the members of Dr. Witz’s‘—family we wish to"’ex-
‘tend the sympathy of the administration, the faculty, and
the student body.

E Earl W. Vensel I

_ The spectre of war swept a little nearer Pitt yesterday
and took its ﬁrst casualty, Earl W. Vensel. He gave his life
just as many others have done on the battleﬁelds of Korea
__ and the farﬁung frontiers of democracy.

But Earl Vensel also gave his life on another battle-
front, the foreward boundaries of science. He was struck
down by an invisible enemy.

Earl Vensel was ﬁghting for something more than a
nation or an economic system; he was ﬁghting for all

‘ mankind. His allegiance in a broad sense was to human-
ity.

 

He joins a long list of men who, through science, have
given their lives thatothers might live. He was a brave man.

Cap and-‘Gown Hibernaling? in

Take a 40-year-old tradition off—campus for
four years and what happens?

Deprived of the oxygen‘ of student interest, it
will be quietly smothered by the passing years.

Has this happened to Cap and Gown, or are
there students attending Pitt who have gumption
enough to do a little research and prove that the
once-famous club for talented '
undergraduate men' is just hi-
bernating?

The hilarious Cap and Gown
Club musicals used to pull big
crowds every, year during their
stay at the Nixon in the late ’20’s
and through the ’30’s. Often they
hit the road when the Nixon en-g

played at the New Nixon last Christmas season.‘

The ’26 show, “Red Moon,” for instance, travel- '

Even the depression couldn’t dent the success

of the 1932 silver anniversary show. It was spon-

sored as usual by the Civic ‘Club of Allegheny
County, and aftera premiere before the Shriners,
was acclaimed as “sparkling entertainment” in its

‘ downtown run. ’

It is impossible to put into this limited space
the music and gags and skits,’ the work and fun
that went into a Cap and Gown revue. But to
catch a little of the color that the shows had, let’s
go backstage with the 1935 Pitt News on the

. closingnight of “In the Soup.”

Kelly Directed Dance
' Gene Kelly directed the dancing chorus that
year. G. Norman Reis, one of the most faithful
members of the Graduate C&G club, had supplied
a sufficiently nutty script about a convention of
Kentucky colonels in Louisville on Derby Day,
built around a guy named Alpha Bett who had
invented a new soup. ‘ _ —

Penn ROTC Delinquen

The Daily Collegian ’ . n‘

A “misunderstanding” among the ,ROTC units
on the Penn State campus about the payment of
federal taxes for their_ military dances had them in
hot water with the Internal Revenue Bureau last
week. A A

The Collegian reports that the Bureau has ﬁled
a tax lien of $1503.34 against the
Penn State Military Ball com’-\
mittee for non—payment of fed-
eral taxes in 1947, 1948, 1949, and
1950. , ' _

A spokesman for the three
ROTC units at State to1d.the Col-
legian that someone in the past
had .been under the impression
that the dance was tax exempt,
and the mistake‘ had been handed _
down to each year.’s new officers,

In June of this year, the spokesman said, fed-
eral tax agents had informed the committee that

 

they were liable for the taxes. At that time ap-

proximately $1,400 -was due and about $500, then

' available in the treasury, was paid.

Last semester’s committee requested that they be
exempted from the balance of the debt, since the
bill covers a four-year period, and past committee
members have graduated. ‘

act is on. Hearty guffaws from the audience, the

a cigarette and is late for curtain. '

murderous, but can’t, because this is the last night
and the show has been rolling good. A

through the night the restaurants and nite clubs X

around town resound to “I Ain’t Fooling and It"

Does that give you some idea of what it was
like? And it belonged exclusively to the men.

Why can’t Cap and Gown be revived?

Think about it, men. Talk about it, too, es-
pecially if you have friends whose talent would ﬁt

Chancellor
Lauds Pitts

By’ DON SCHURMAN

Returning to the dressing
room after their belated ef-
fort to overtake Ohio State,
Captain 'Hamilton’s boys received
a noteworthy piece of praise from
Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald.

Speaking before the whole team,
Fitzgerald said, “You showed more
spirit today than any team I have
ever seen play at the Stadium. We
are proud of you.”

Contrary to several reports that
the Panthers were considerably
happy after the game, however,
the Pitts instead showed keen dis-
appointment over their showing.

One of the Blue-and—Gold apolo-I

getically said to Hamilton, “I’m
sorry we couldn’t win the game for
you, Captain.”

I =4: :1: :1:

Although weakened by a severe
chest cold early in the week, Lou
Cimarolli was Pitt’s leading ground
gainer with 42 yards in 10 carries.
He thus remained tops in that de-
partment for the season, netting
317 yards in 66 attempts for an
average of 4.81.

Come to Pitt for a good course in human nature.
.With the Panthers dropping their 15th in the last 16
last Saturday the so-called Pitt ‘fans’ had a ﬁeld day.

As far as scoring is concerned the Pitts came the

closest, 16-14, to snapping their losing

streak since the

Pitt-Penn State encounter last year.

Last fall the Buckeyes whipped Pitt, 41-7. ' Everyone

came away from the tilt sayingé.
. they lost, they’re no good.

But in a close contest the fans
criticize individuals without think-
ing. .

Blanda Most Popular

It seems that the disappointment
of the fans can bealleviated onl
through undue criticism. ’

_ First the fans were on every-
body’s back about the nonappear-
ance of Paul Blanda.

“W h e r e ’ s Blanda, - What's
Hamilton waiting for, Look at
that miserable kickoff, Aw,
Wrabley’s just lucky,” were just
a. few of the comments about the
missing Blanda.

The truth was that Blanda had =

a. badly bruised hip and a boil on
his hand. If anyone were to be
blamed, it would be the athletic
publicity department which failed
toeinform the public of Blanda’s

. condition before thegame.

Complaint Dept. Needed

nature regarding Jim Campbell,‘

Jacobs. I

to know. where they’ve been,
why they’haven’t played before.
In general they blamed every-

, one from Captain Tom to trainer
Howard Waite.

Now if these two boys 'had
played a poor brand of ball or even
mediocre, the fan’s ‘viewpoint
would have been jiist the opposite.

of the Bridgeville Kiwanis-

Club before a partisan Pitt crowd

of 3100:‘

By sheer weight and strength
of numbers the Buckeyes were
able to punch over two touch-

downs and a ﬁeld-goal in the

fourth quarter after the two elev-
ens had see—sawed up and down
the gridiron for three stanzas.
Neither team threatened in the
initial quarter, but, the second
opened up fast when Pitt tackle
Bob Nesbit jarred the ball away
from State’s John _Shelton and the
Jungle Cubs took over on Ohio’s
nine. However, the strbng Buck-
eye line thwarted the Panthers
and State took over. -

Frosh-JV Uncover Punter

The third quarter was high-
lighted by Steve Pepoy’s punts one
of which went out of bounds on
the Buckeye one-yard line.

An injury to ﬂashy halfback
Chester Rice of Derry Township
curtailed the Panther running at-
tack during the second half, al-
though Bobby Ingram, converted
center, performed creditably.

Last Stanza Spree

Midway through the ﬁnal stan-
za quarterback Frank Edwards
hit Shelton for a seven-yard TD.
For the. remaining seven minutes,
Ohio State ran wild. Fullback Bpob
Watkins plunged over from the
one after Bud Hoffman had
snakehipped his way from the
State 20 only _to be driven‘ out of
bounds by Ingram.

Over WISGA Politics

By BEE MORGRET
Co-eds in J ohnstown Center are up to their necks -in

politics.

‘It seems that the feminine population there has a gov-
erning organization called the WSGA, too, and «even the

WSGA is busy.

First of all, they held an elec-,
tion to select a president for the
group. Thelma Sipe a ﬁrst se-
mester sophomore who was "named
‘the outstanding freshman of last
year, won the post of _prexy.

Election Tossed Out
But some faction of the group

‘suits-—-and threw out the whole:
election. They then turned around
and ‘held an another election. Re-
sult? A new ‘-president, Ann Koch-
er.

Edward Kane, editor of the
Center’s newspapers, The Panther

brought to be.ar on ,Miss .Sipe who
was _asked to keep quiet and
“above -all, don’t let The Panther

But they did ﬁnd out. It seems

dent Congress heard the story
from one of the members -of
WSGA, and he, in turn, informed
Kane. - .
Double President
In the "meantime,  Kocher;

Chlb, thus automatically 
into action the clause in the Cen-
ter’s constitution which prohibits
any student from holding the top’
post in two organizations.

Charles A. Markel, president of
Student Congress, said if Miss
Koeléer refuses to "resign one of,
the positions, ‘Congress -can with-;
hold appropriations to both c1ubs.3
He also -said that Congress can;

.A
T

refuse permission for either- club.
to hold any social activities. .
So the question is: If Miss Koch-
er resigns from the presidency -of
the WSGA,- will there be a third
election? ‘ I
From all sides -it looks as if it’s_

‘ going to be a busy season for the’

co—eds at the Center.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

No. 27...'l'H£ nmx A

\\

This sporty student really teed off on a long tirade
when he found himself stymied on the “single puff”,
and “tone sni ” cigarette tests. “They’re strictly
for the birdies!” said he. He realized that A
cigarette mildness requires more deliberation .
than a cursory inhale or exhale. Millions of‘
smokers concur — there’s only one true test of

Imildnessland ﬂavor in a cigarette.

It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try _
Camels as your steady smoke on a day-after-day,‘
pack-after-pack basis. No snap judgments! Once
you’ve tried" Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
(T for'Throat, T for Taste), you’ll see why . . .

After all the Mildness Tests . . .

Of a Hardy

By BOB THOMAS

That lusty crew from ol’ Oklahoma Territory sang and
danced their way onto the stage of the Nixon Monday night
in a way that assures their welcome once more in the Steel

City.

From the opening song, “Oh
What a Beautiful Morning” to the
roaring “Oklahoma” ﬁnale, it is a
“beautiful evening” for playgo-
er. »
Bond Performance Tops

Mr. Ridge Bond plays the hero
Curly, to perfection with the deep
mellow voice, the open smile, and
the personable swagger that en-
dears him to the audience. _

The beautiful Miss 1‘Patricia
Johnson as Laurey complements
him ‘to bring out the best in the’
two lead parts as the winsome lass
captures his heart and falls in

love with him, but won’t admit it

From there the play whirls on
with a spontaneous gaity, real
humor at times, a touch of pathos,
and, of course, superb singing and
music. , °

The dancing, good all the way,
shines brightest when the play
dips into the subconscious of Cur-
ly and Laurey in a captivating se-
quence, “Out of My Dreams.”

Time Means Nothing
The play does not show wear

and tear from its more than eight,

years before the footlights. It is

Critic Acclaims Return

Perennial

still fresh and enchanting, a real ‘

portrayal of the big—hearted West
in its happy moments.

AMiss Mary Marlo ﬁlls out the
part of Aunt Eller with a person-
ality as wide as her neatly-apron-
ed lap. Mr. Walter Donahue rol-
licks bronco busting Will Parker
onto the stage in ﬁne fashion as
he purues scatterbrained Ado An-
nie Carnes from ranch yard to-
box social and back again._

Singing Comic

The part of Ado Annie gets ex-
cellent treatment from Miss Jac-
queline Sundt although she is in-
clined to over-exaggerate the nas-
al comedy effects in her singing.

Jud Fry becomes an unforget-
ful villian under the skilled play-
ing of Mr. Henry Clarke. Mr. Jer-
ry Mann burnishes a bright spot
on the stage each time he darts
into view as peddler Ali Hakim.
His “Persian goodbye,” bright dia-
logue, and perfect timing on de-
livery keep the audience waiting
for each new appearance of the
little man in the checkered dude
suit and the too—large sombrero.
