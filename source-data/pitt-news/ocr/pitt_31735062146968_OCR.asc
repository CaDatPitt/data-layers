Nov. 11 No Longer Holiday;
Merely Reminder of Truce

By Harriet

Ackerman

“November 11-—University holiday” will not likely appear in the
future editions of the Vade Mecums and Compasses, nor will banks

hang up a notice “November 11—Closed for legal holiday.”

For

Armistice day today is merely a reminder of a truce and will no
longer be celebrated as a reminder of lasting peace.
Exactly 23‘ years ago on the night of November 7, four men with

wearyfaees motored to Rethondes,

in the forest of Compiegne. They

were Secretary of State Eizberger,¢
Major General von Winte-rfelt,
Minister Count Oberndorf, and
Capt. Vanselow——the German mis-
sion on its way to surrender at
the office of Marshal Ferdinand
Foch. By 11 o’clock November
11, the terms of armistice had
been accepted.

On November 11, 1919, Presi-
dent Wilson issued a proclamation
reminding the nation of the day.
When a feeling developed in 192'1
that the unidentified dead should
be honored, an unknown Ameri-

can soldier was brought from
France and‘ on Armistice day
buried in Arlington -cemetery

with elaborate ceremonies, includ-
ing an address by President Hard-
ing.

In 11926, Congress adopted a
resolution directing each Presi-
dent to issue an annual proclama-
tion calling upon the people to
observe the day. Twenty-nine
states called November 11 a legal
holiday while the others observed
it in response to the governor’s
proclamation.

Posterity will be adding a new
paragraph to the history of Arm-
istice -day. At the present time the
people realize that great nations
have a way of getting back on
their feet and seeking revenge
against the victors of yesterday.
Americans are wondering when
and under what conditions will
the next peace, and not truce, be
made?

and the benediction. The Heinz
Chapel choir, under the direction
of Dr. Theodore M. Finney, will
perform a specially prepared pro-
gram.

Invited to the service, which
will last from 4 to 5 o’clock in the
afternoon, are the family and
friends of the servicemen whose
memory will be honored. Military
stations of the third service com-
mand in this district are all con-
ducting memorial services this
Sunday; the University of Pitts-
burgh and the Hunt armory mil-
itary commands are holding their
services in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral.

Administration members in
charge of the service here at Pitt
are Dr. Farmer, Dr. Raymond F.
Brittain, Robert L. Arthur, Dr.
Finney, and Dean of Men Theo-
dore W. Biddle. Military com-
manders in charge are Major Mer-
lin V. Wills, Colonel Lucius MCK.
Crumrine, and Captain William B.
Preston, of the Pittsburgh military
command.

There is no outlet for student literary expression on the Pitt
campus today. In this respect, we are far behind other colleges.

On most cainpuses—and even on prep school campuses—a
good literary magazine supported by student interest is regarded
as essential. Educators generally .recognize the fact that imag-
inative and creative talent in young people must be exercised
and given an outlet if it is to ﬂourish and grow rather than
wither with dis-use. in a university ‘the size of Pitt there must
be a great deal of creative talent which is at present without an
opportunity for expression._

Several years ago the Quill club published a literary 1uaga-
zinc‘ and not long ago Pitt studentspublished tthe Panther, a
magazine devoted to short stories, essays, ‘satire, poetry, and
humorous pieces. ’,oth these publications were discontinued
due to difficulties in obtaining paper and, probably due to lack
of real student interest. It is our belief that student interest in
a literary magazine could be aroused through a well thought-
out campaign and We are ready with concrete suggestions should
a group of competent students be interested in reviving a liter-
ary magazine. The paper shortage has been overcome on other
campuses and can be here. It is a diﬂiculty to be overcome and
not an impossibility blocking our way.

If you are interested in bringing a new and improved
Panther back to the Pitt campus‘, come to the Pitt News office

i and we will put you, in contact with other students with the

same idea.
Reviving the Panther will not only offer you and others an

I, outlet for literary expression, but. it will do the student body as

Just in passing, a few words of comment on that red-letter

a service which will not go unappro-

night of social activity—Saturday the 4th. It seems to me that

the core of the discussion, pro and con, is not the “treasonous”
non-support of the Soph Hop by individual ‘fraternities nor is
it the questionable “efficiency” of the clearing house for social
events. Rather it is: “Which do you prefer—-University spon-
sored dances or private affairs?” It is doubtful if Student Con-
gress Will be so willing to back dances inthe future if the threat

, of failure due to outside competition looms on the horizon.

Think it over.

the papers,” indicated, if nothing else, that at least he was keep-

ignorant of the daily situation.

Not so Pitt students! If they miss up on a meeting, they

By Lee Mclnerny

A condition in this college for the past three or four weeks, one

that not only aroused and excited,

but caused more antagonism than

a lot of people know about, is now going to be thoroughly aired in
this column. At least, I hope this puts an end to the discussion cir-

culating around the University.

The Soph Hop was at the Hotel Schenley Saturday night.

of 300 tickets were sold, most of

A total
which ‘were purchased by service

men and people outside the Uni-6

versity. In plain language, that
means the expenses were met suc--
cessfully and that the’ college boys
support the
dance.

It is understood-the latter is a
very touchy accusation to make;
Nevertheless, it happens to be true,
if the reports I’ve received from
the So-ph Hop committee are true
—and I have every reason to be-
lieve they are.

The subject that has caused all
the controversy is th-at an organ-
ization knowns as the “Smooth.
Fellows” supposedly were trying
to shelve the Soph Hop——to keep
the committee from even so much
as meeting expenses by having a
little party of their own Satur-
day night at the F0-rt Pitt hotel.
Two men’s fraternities partici-
pated in this affair; another fra-
ternity also had quite a gala time
at the William Penn the same
evening.

Some people were inclined to
think that these social gatherings
were intentional, the evening had
been purposely chosen to coincide
with the Soph Hop night, that
these so-called students had evil
designs, so to speak. The ac-
cused have denied any such inten-
tions, and far be it fr-om this col-
umn to take- one side against the
other.

The exact situation is this. The
University cannot and d-oes not
prevent any group or individual
from having a private dance
whether it be on the night of the
Soph Hop or not. Therefore, the
“Smooth Fell-ows” and the other
gay young blades were entirely
within their rights. The m-ost they
can be accused of is non-coopera-
tion and lack of school spirit. But
even that is treading on‘ unsafe
grounds, because the “Smooth
Fellows” insist they arranged
their aﬁair without knowledge of
the Soph Hope date. The answer
to that usually . . “Well, why
d’ya h-ave your Compass, any-
way!” Both sides have their sub-

stantiati-ons; neither is accom-
plishing anything except exchange
of unfriendly feelings.

Suppose (and this is only a sug-
gestion) everyone drops the sub-
ject. The whole thing was very
unfortunate. Certainly, t h e r e
should be no repetition of it. Just
manage to keep your eye on dates
in the Compass; support your
school activities; ("some fraterni-
ties please note that last sugges-
tion); and let’s have no more to-
mato throwing. lt’s understood, of
course, that you have the privilege
to accept or reject that advice.
Also, let it be understood that
speciﬁc names of individuals and
fraternities were purposely not
used in this column.

New LSA Chaplain
Has Many Interests

Reporting dormitory gossip used
to be the business of the Rev.
Gordon S. Huffman, new chap-
lain of the Lutheran Student as-
sociation. While atten-ding Len-
oir Rhyne college in Hickory,
N-orth Carolina, he sup-p-lied the
town’s paper with college news.

.But he left the presses to study

theology at Capital university in
Columbus, Ohio.

‘Rev. Huffman, while serving as
assistant pastor at the St. Johns
Lutheran church -of Akron, Ohio,
took an active interest in the
young people. He gave them three
and a half year.s of loyal atten-
tion, and then received a church
of his own in Mars, Pa.

Developing ﬂuid has repl.aced
the printer’s ink in his veins. He
likes to “dabble in photography”
and is especially proud of his
amateur movies.

Although he is new to the cam-
pus, having come only this fall,
Rev. Huffman has already carved
a niche for himself, and is looking
forward to many more enjoyable
associations with Pitt students.

May I express my thanks to all
those who helped to make the
Off The Record ball the success
it was. It is my hope that all who
attended had an excellent time.
Preparation for a dance of this
kind takes a great deal of work.
Without the aid of so many of my
classmates and fellow—studentsx,_I
would have been unable to gm:
you Pitt students the kind of
dance you deserved.

Another thing which deserves
praise is the way the men’s and
women’s fraternities helped boost
the dance. Their help was deﬁ-
nitely appreciated. 1

Again may I thank all those
people who willingly gave -their
time gratis: the publicity com-
mittee;
tee; the decorations committee;
The Pitt News; and the faculty.

LOWELL LUBIC,
Chairman, Soph Hop.

The sister of a friend of mine
is a senior in the School of Phar-
macy, and I went down ‘to visit
her l.ast ‘week. While I was there,
I met some of the girls in the
school and we had a real “gab—
fest.” When I told them this was
my ﬁrst visit, and «that I hadn’t
known where the place was, they
laughe-d and said, “Yes, that’s the
way “things are. You kids on cam-
pus don’t know there is such a
thing as a pharmacy school.”

Well, that started something.
We talked and talked, and I came
away with a sympathetic feeling
for the position of the men and
women in the school.

They want to be closer to cam-A
pus life, to know about the dances,
the traditional events, and even
the drives. They feel segregated
and resent the lack of football

tickets, and publicity in The Pitt *

News.

the ticket sales commit-.

 

\.

“Maybe if one or ‘two of us I

could :be active, or take part in
Women’s Self-Government asso-
ciation, it would bring us closer
to the campu.s,” -one of the girls
suggested and added, “The fresh-
man girls miss all those events
in the fall.”

I know that there are many
difficulties in the way of closer
campus ties for the pharmacy stu-
dents. They are in a professional
school and a good distance from’
campus; they have heavy sched-
ules, plus work in drug stores,
that limit their time. But, in spite
of all this, I believe that the phar-
macy students can be closer to
campus. If they and -the campus
students could try to work to-
gether, get acquainted, and if
their position. with relation to the
rest of the university could be
deﬁned, campus students would
no longer be surprised to know
that there is a pharmacy school.

I know these students deserve
some kind of recognition.

Tiny radio waves, shorter‘ than any used before in commercial

telephone speech and television programs.
These waves travel in straight lines like beams of light.
' Because of the earth’s curvature, the distance will be spanned
in a series of straight-line jumps between transmitting and

“World Without Men” meets in
room 144 CL today. Did you
have vague thoughts of some up-
rising and a desire to join this
group that had such ﬁne ideas?
We’re sorry, but that’s the title
and rehearsal information for the
ﬁrst of the one-act plays planned
by the Pitt Players for their pro-
duction, November 30.

This story of a woman scientist’s
desire to make the world better
.by ridding it of men (and it has
its points) is directed by Milton
Tokash, C. With a seven-girl
cast, (Milt has his troubles. “I
have seven problems to begin
with, and then I have to worry
about getting everyone together
for rehearsals, making sure that
lines and movements are learned,
and making the girls control facia.l
expressions. And then I have an
all-girl production staff.” He
shook his head, added suddenly,
“But no applications for assistant

Pigs Four

-- gweez‘ ancl’l.£aw-35awn--

By Arnold

For some ti-me now there has
been a debate among music cir-
cles as to whether the bandleader
that swings a stick or the band-
leader that blows a horn is here
to stay. As far as the public is
concerned, I believe that they
would prefer the system to re-
main as it is at present. They
seem to enjoy the showmen such
as Cab 'Calloway or Kay Kyser
as much as they do the musicians
such as Harry James or Tommy
Dorsey. Let us see what the musi-
cians have to say about it.

Raymond Scott takes the atti-
tude that the bandleader -belongs
out in "front of the band, not play-
ing but bringing out the expres-
sion and dynamics much as sym-
phony conductors do. He con-
tends that there are three types
of bandleaders: (1) those that
play an instrument so well that
the band is built around them,
(2) those that play an instrument
but prefer to conduct, and (3)
those who con-duct because the
baton is the only instrument they
know. In the ﬁrst class we ﬁnd
most of the swing bandleaders of
today. Scott says that this class
is bad in the respect that the lead-
er usually hogs all the solo spots
and doesinot give any of his tal-
ented sidemen a chance to shine.
In class two are the men who de-
cided that in order to lead a band
successfully, all time must be de-
voted to conducting and -not play-
ing. Some of these leaders are Jan
Savitt, Teddy Powell, and Jimmy
Lunceford. In the ﬁnal class are
Phil Harris, Kay Kyser, and Hor-
ace Heidt who are strictly show-
men and businessmen and have
no intention of ever; fronting their
bands with an instrument. So,
Raymond Scott concludes, band-
leading is an art in itself and the
next few years will show that
the days of the supervirtuoso
leaders are over.

The other side of the story is
taken up by’ Benny Goodman,
one -of the supervirtuosos that
Scott talks ab-ou-t. Benny says,
“The public is sick of stick-wav-
ers!” Here are several of his rea-
sons. The dance band of today
doesn’t need a baton because the
regulation of tempo and time
-changes is eliminated by the strict I
tempo of dance music. As far as.
dynami-cs go, these can be set atl

 

rehearsal. The young hepster is
the patron today; he expects the .
men in front of -the band to have
something to offer, and he doesn’t

mean waving a stick or snap-ping
his ﬁngers. Benny says that one of
the big factors involved is that
the musician-leader will have
more respect and cooperation from
his men if he is as good a musi-
cian as any of them. He names
Jack Teagareden, the -Dorsey broth-
ers, Artie Shaw, ‘Charlie Barnet,
etc., as examples of the above
points. So, Benny Goodman con-
cludes, a few years from now the
ba-ton in the jazz world will be
so much dead wood.

What do I think? Which side
do I take? I am neutral! In sid-
ing with the public I’m safe. I
really like Goodman and Dorsey
but then again I don’t shut Kyser
off when he comes on the air.
Now here comes the .point—-—in or-
der to see what the typical Pitt
student likes and dislikes in the
world of entertainment, what say
we have a poll in a few weeks for
favorite singers, favorite bands,
etc. Okey?

Retail Training Bureau
Accepting Applications

The Research Bureau for Re-
tail Training is now accepting ap-
plications for the next class, be-
ginning September, 1945. Since
only a limited number of upper-
class as well as graduate students
can be accepted, Mildred P.
Moren, the office manager, has ad-
visedearly application at the of-
ﬁce on the nineteenth ﬂoor.

Ruth Branigan, assistant pro-
fessor of advertising, says that all
students interested in the Bureau
may visit the school classrooms,
lounge, and laboratory and that
any student may make use of the
retail library. Miss Branigan add-
ed that staff members of the Bu-
reau would be glad to explain to
prospective students the theoretic-
al and practical phases of the re-

Prof. Reduces
Fiction Writing
To Equations

Norman, Okla.—(ACP)——By re-

ducing the basic pattern of ﬁction
writing to a simple equation, like
pride plus love, William Foster
Harris, one -of the country’s most
proliﬁc magazine authors and an
instructor in creative writing at
the University of Oklahoma, has
turned his pupils into money-
makers.

Students taking his courses
have sold nearly a millionwords
of ﬁction during the past 12
months and earned for them-
selves $10,000. The secret of how
it is done is contained in his new
book, The Basic Formulas of Fic-
tion, published October 25, by the
University of Oklahoma press.

Plotting a story, always the
stumbling block of beginning
writers, according to Harris, is
actually no more diﬁicult than
school-room arithmetic, once the
student masters the simple equa-
tions.

In his book he shows how the
equations are applied, using a
variety of situations and charac-
ters. How «the masters of ﬁction
writing have handled their equa-
tions is revealed in analyses of
stories from Robert Louis Stev-
enson’s time to today’s issue of
Saturday Evening Post.

Together with the actual for-
mulas, Harris presents successful
theories for characterization, pol-
ishing, working habits, analyses
of markets, and other facets of
writing for a living.

Some of his students, to whom
he has proved that writing for a
living is abundantly possible, are
commanding rates as high as 20
cents a word. In addition to the
Saturday Evening Post, their sto-
ries have appeared in Cosmopoli-
tan, The New Yorker, Blue Book,
Adventure, and many others.

By Buddy Lenchner and Margie Long

“Eenie, rneanie, minie, moe-—.”
Who will be ﬁrst and who must
be last? There should be a law
against columns where one para-
graph follows another. One solu-
tion would be to string each item
along the top of the page in a
clothes line pattern. But I don’t
think The Pitt News would appre-
ciate such genius. So let’s be dif-
ferent and try it alphabetically.

A is for Alpha and Alpha Epsi-
lon Phi. The girls were dressed
“ﬁt to scare” at their Hallowe’en
costume party. AEPhi Found-
er’s Day was October 24 when the
Pitt chapter and their Tech
Alpha Nu chapter celebrated with
a dinner at the Concordia club.

I And last night Lucille Morgan and

Mimi Odle were dinner guests at
their apartment.

B is for Beta in Beta Sigma
Omicron. Their executive secre-
tary and past president of National
Panhellenic Council, Mrs. J. C.
Burnaugh, visited Alpha Tau for
several days. The Beta Sigs had
a dinner in her honor at the Royal
York on Monday evening.

A triangle stands for Delta and

three make Delta Delta Delta.

They had a tea dance at their
house yesterday afternoon for the
PiKAs. Anne Follansbee was
‘elected the new Tri-Delt vice pres-
ident in place of Ruth Jane Col-
mery who joined the Waves.

Another triangle makes for

Delta Zeta who, I understand, is
scouting for all sorts of college
pennants to decorate their game
room. '

K is for Kappa which this week
represents Kappa Alpha Theta.
Last Monday evening the Thetas
entertained their brother frater-
nity, the Phi Gams, at a dessert
party. 0

M is for Mu, put Phi in front,
and we have Phi Mu. Mrs. Geneva
W. Moore, Phi Mu district presi-
dent, will visit their chapter the
week of November 14, and the
girls are having a dinner for her
the ﬁrst evening.

Phi (use your imagination to
picture it; I’m at a loss for words)
is for Phi Sigma Sigma. From the
trend of the Phi Sigs’ conversation
the last few days, they must have

had a wonderful time as the guests
of Alpha Omega. The Pitt dental
fraternity entertained the sisters
at a tea dance'Sunday afternoon.

X symbolizes Chi in Chi Omega.
The Chi Os had another of their
monthly buffet suppers at their
apartment last Tuesday evening.

Well, here we are at the end of
the alphabet which will make a
good starting point for next week’s“
column.

I have lots of fraternity news
for you readers today. Someone

The Delts are hol-ding a tea
dance at their house today for the
Kappas. The Delt pledges spent
most of the week end getting the
house cleaned and decorated for
this afternoon’s event.

Most of the Phi Delts will spend
the week-end at Ohio State. The
boys are going for the football
game, and they will stay over for
a house dance at the Ohio State
Phi D-elt h-ouse -on Saturday night.

The Phi Eps will say goodbye to
Paul Steinlauf, their vice superior,
tomorrow. Paul is leaving for the
navy. Phi Ep and the University
will remember Paul for the ﬁne
job he did last ‘May as chairman
of the spring festival.

The PiKAs were the guests of
the Tri Delts yesterday at a tea
dance. The theme of the dance
was “Election Day,” and the boys
did their best to stay out of polit-
ical arguments.

If you only knew what we go
through every week to get this
stuff to you. We go off in corners
with our underground reporters
and people sit and stare at us,
muttering (and licking their lips
lewdly), “Another dirty joke.” See
what we mean?

The OTR dance was the blind-
datin’est dance we ever did see.
There was at least 25 that we
know of, and the most nervous
person there was the one who ﬁx-
ed up those 25 people. Some peo-
ple will go to- any lengths to sell
a ticket, won’t they?

Seen at the dance: Frosh Joyce
Albrecht and “Curly” Goss; not
enough Pitt students; Ral (Turtle)
Merchant and (this week) Helen
Herman.

The two stags you saw w-olfing
at the Hop were Bruce (Gob-for-
a-Night) Royter and Owney (Only
Forever) McManus.. They started
out at ya rip—roaring Short Sn-ort-
ers’ party, made hay (who’s this
kid Hay?) and -a couple of hard
noses at the dance, ﬁnally ending
up at assorted places. Large even-
ing!

Ruth Crawford’s making her
dating official now that she’s no
longer wearing Lee McFadden’s
pin.

Carol Pitzer rated a gardenia

Jack Spence is in town from

Surprise of the week was Larry
B-.1rwinkel’s appearance in school
on .Monday. We thought he’d be
completely and utterly beat from
the jitterbug routine he put on to
win a big fat record album at the
Soph Hop. His date, by the way,
was a dream who followed him
around like a shadow. Ah, what a
shadow!

And now we leave you with this
parting bit of information. The
Tri Delts and PiKAs are recup-
erating from yesterday’s tea
dance. The theme was the elec-
tion and Deweyites and Roosevelt-
ians were beating it out over a
game of musical chairs.

You All Know Nancy . . .
She Rings Up Sales

By Lee Mclnerney

Have you ever tried passing the cash register in the red Tuck

Shop without slapping your nickle down ﬁrst?

You have? Well,

then you must know Nancy. Deﬁnitely, you must know Nancy!
Nancy, whose last name is Sculli, has worked nine and one-half
years in the Tuck Shop, and she’s known as “an old hand” at the

business.

The ﬁrst ﬁve years she spent making sandwiches for the

students; then she was transferred to the cash register where she’s

been ringing up sales ever since.¢

Nancy wasn’t, isn’t, and never
will be shy about pointing out to
non-paying -customers the exact
spot of her palm where coins
should be placed. She says this
course of action is used mostly
because people are forgetful . . .
not because they ﬁnd it unpleas-
ant to pay for their food. When
she comes across students who
want their cake and money, too,
she becomes very ﬁrm. You part
with one or the other, and there
are no two ways about it.

Coke, not cake, is the popular
item with the college boys and
gi-rls, according to Nancy. She
said that “she expects to see coke
running out of the kids’ ears
someday,” so you can see how
bad the situation is.

But even though the Univer-
sity is composed of coke-addicts,
Nancy insists the students are a
good bunch. “One fourth of them
complain all the time,” she said,
“but the rest make up for them.
Now it seems that all of them
want a juke-box in the Tuck
Shops. I don’t know where they’d
put it, but it seems like a good
idea. What’s a little more noise?”

The dark-eyed “ringer-upper,”

‘ as the girls and boys call her, is

popular with the students be-
cause she’s in sympathy with most
-of their hearts’ desires and the juke
box is a pretty good example of
that. There has. been one recent
exception to this congenial atti-
- tude, however. Nancy sighed when
she admitted it.

“The cigarette situation is pretty
stiff these days. If the kids would
only get one pack a day, instead
of going from the Red to the Blue
Tuck Shop, collecting all they can,
cigarettes would last much longer.”

Deftly, she caught the passing
sleeve of a coke-ﬁend. “Pay your
nickle, puleeze!”

You’re right. He paid it.

There will be a meeting for
all feature staff members of
‘The Pitt News today at 2
o’clock on the eighth ﬂoor.

Heh, ‘heh, we thought it was

RECORD RELEASES

You’ll enjoy hearing Bing Cros-
by and the Andrews sisters get
happy on “Is You Is Or Is You
Ain’t?” Don’t miss it.

Duke Ellington ha.s released a
few tunes you’ll want to bend an
ear to. One -of thernis “I Don’t
Mind” as sung by Ivie Anderson,
the unusual femme warbler with
Duke’s band. The coupling is an
instrumental entitled “What Am I
Here For?” Another of his latest is
“Passion Flower” and “Going Out
The Ba-ck Way.” On the ﬁrst
Johnny Hodges gets into a roman-
tic mood with his tenor sax while
on the latter Duke gives with a
piano solo.

Among Victo-r’s latest re-issues
is one I’d like to recommend. It’s
a smooth hit of yesterday that is
fast becoming a popular standard
today, “»Don’t Blame Me” as done
by Shep Fields and the boys.

Lou Prima has) recorded. “Robin
Hood” twice. One is a strictly in-
strumental number, while on the

other he adds the vocal. For our

money, we’ll take the instrument-
al. It’s better for dancing.

Frisky Panthers
Hope For Upset

Pitt Engages
Buckeyes .

The Panthers invade enemy ter-
ritory on Saturday when they
meet the Ohio State Buckeyes, one
of the strongest football teams in
the country. The Buckeyes boast

an undefeated season to date, and
they don’t wish to see it marred.
Coach Carroll C. Widdoes, sub-
bing for Lt. (jg.) Paul Brown
who is on active duty with the
navy, displays a team rich in vet-
erans and outstanding freshmen
material.

The battle-scarred Panthers
realize the task facing them as
well as the Buckeyes that an un-
derratedi Pitt team in 1938 shook
the Fordham Rams from the ranks
-of und-efeated, back in 1938.

From last year’s squad, the
Buckeyes have Bill (Deacon) Wil-
lis, whom Coach Lynn Waldorf of
Northwestern called the b e-st
tackle in the all-.star game. At the
other tackle post is Russ Thom-
as, who saw little action last year
because of injuries. The ends are
Jack Dugger, who led the Staters
to vi-ctory over Indiana last week
by snaring two touchdown passes,
and Cecil So-u'der.s..In the center
of the line is veteran George Ap-
pleby rated as one of the best in
the country, and at his sides are
guards Bill Hackett and Ed Sny-
der. The ‘Buckeyes boast of a
green backﬁeld but it is a gleam-
ing one. Les Horvath, who is bid-
ding for‘. All American honors this
year,- handles the tail back post.
Teaming up with him are Ollie
Cline, a 200—pound speedster
playing full, 17-year-old Dick
Flanagan, weighing 195 pounds: at
right half, and another freshman,
Tom Keane, at the other halfback
p-ost.

Coach Shaugrhnessy expects to
start the same line-up as faced
Chatham ﬁeld. He feels that while
Pitt is facing one of the “best”
teams in the country, the “best”
is hoped for.

‘Phantoms Play

Practice iTilt.s

Pitt’s basketball Phantoms had
their mettle tested twice this last
week. Games with the Corbetts
and the Gurrentz ﬁvewere held
on the Pavillion floor and the
Carlsonmen did “right well” for
themselves although no otﬁcial

score was kept. The Corbett -team
showed the Phantoms a flashy
brand of ball as they put the
youngsters through their paces. On
the other hand, the Pitt players

. showed superior court. play with

the Gurren-tz quintet. In these
practice games, however, the play-
ers -concentrate on the teachings
of Dr. -Carlson and the score is a
secondary matter.

The Pitt cage mentor has bezn
working the ﬂoormen in squads
and is quite pleased with the way
things are turning out. Dr. Carl-
son insists on rattling off a long
list of names every time he is
asked about the players who are
showing the best form. “I have
ten good men,” said the coach.
“They are Canterna, Apple, Mor-
ris, Jacobson, ‘Marder, Malarkey,
Burns, Lewis, Mihalic, Sponge,
Cellers, Bortner, Kahn, Schaick,
Smith, Rosenbloom, and Barnes.”
When it was called to _Carlson’s
attention that he had named more
than «ten ‘players he just men-
tioned that Pitt has a lot of good
boys this year.

The Phantoms -have two more
practice games scheduled for this
week. They engage the YMHA
tonight on the Y ﬂoor, and, the
Corbetts the following night on
the Pavillion ﬂoor. By playing
quintets that have more experi-
ence than the Phantoms, Dr. Carl-
son hopes to get -his ‘boys ready
to face a long and diiﬁcult sched-
ule that is being arranged for the
coming campaign.

The old believe everything; the
mid-dle-aged suspect everything;
the young know everything.

SAES Stopped
By Phi Cams

The IF touch-football league has
already narrowed down, into .1
race between the Delts, the Phi
Eps, and the PiKAs. Each of these
teams has shown its superiority
by lopsi-ded wins over the other
teams in the loop.

Phi Eps Tie Delts

_ In a game featured by offensive
play the Phi Eps came from be-
hind to tie the Delts, 24-24. Again
it was the great passing combina-
tion of Biehl to Thomson that
sparked the Delts. For the Phi
Eps it was the brilliant playing of
Norman Weissman who sparked

the Phi Eps to three of its four‘

touchdowns. Both teams scored
consistently with the Phi Eps hav-
ing to come from behind to tie up
the score in the ﬁnal minute of

play. _ 4
. P1KAs Flash Power
The PiKAs exhibited their

vaunted power by defeating the
Phi Delts, 42-0, and moved into
ﬁrst place in the race for the foot-
ball trophy. The all around play-
ing of the entire PiKA team fea-
tured the contest. Due credit is
given to the PiKA line which kept
the Phi Delts deep in their own
territory at all times. The pass-
ing duo of Gallager to Wood sup-

plied the offensive touch for the,

victors.
Pi Lambs Split Even
After losing to the SAE, 14-6,

the Pi Lambs bounced back and
downed the Sigma Chis, 30-18.

Led by the running and passing"

of Larry Yahr, the Pi Lambs took
command early in the game and
never gave the Sigma Chis
chance to come back. -

Phi Gams Stop SAE

The Phi Gams knocked the SAEs
from the unbeaten ranks by cop-
ping a 24-12 verdict. The SAE
team had previously downed the
Pi Lambs and was looking for its
third triumph when a ﬁghting Phi
Gam aggregation that had dropped
two of its ﬁrst three engagements
upset them, The loss dropped the
SAEs into fourth place in the
loop standings. .

Real .44 7/0“ Ran ' 

By Deirdre Baird

Once upon a time it was fun to
go to Pitt. Of course it wasn’t Pitt
then, it was WUP; but it was fun.
AtiWUP, everybody studied very
hard and posed for the Owl in
cap and gown, most sedate and
solemn; an-d there was a mando-
lin club; and there were only
three girls _in the sophomore class;
and the professors really looked.
professorial and were obligingly
absent-minded. But when the pro-
fessors 'weren’t looking professor-
ial they were playing baseball
with the undergraduates, and
when the undergraduates weren’t
studying, all hell let loose. It was
very collegiate.

In the good old days at WUP,
anything could happen, The Phil-
omathean played football with the
Classical -club in sneakers -and ki-
monos, ‘while a subversive element

. in the student body published, for

about two issues, “The -Bomb,” a
refreshingly uncensored sheet
about the faculty. A green ribbon
proclaimed the wearer as one of the
elite who had been expelled more
than ﬁve times from the library
for whispering; playful biology
students let loose a barrelful of
live frogs‘ in the reading room;
and a few more imaginative stu-
dents arranged skeletons and
stuffed specimens from the med
school in ‘studious poses around
the library table. '

In those days there was at WUP
a quaint institution known as
“chapel” (attendance required)
which the boys ‘did’ their best to
make eventful. Once they stopped
an -old Italian image-vendor and

told him that there was a big

crowd inside, lots of customers.
“-Only,” they warned him, “don’t
pay any attention to that man up
front. He’s crazy.” Happily, the lit-
tle Italian wandered up and do-wn
the aisles, calling his wares and

‘holding the plaster ﬁgures up for

all to see. The dean hurried iiom

the platform. “My good man,” he
expostulated, “you can’t sell
those things here!” *DThe little
Italian looke-d around at the as-
sembly, winked slyly, and tapped
his forehead with a grimy fore--
finger. “He’sa crazy,” he said, and
went on selling.

Nowadays, things are different.
Nobody studies any more, and no-
body ha.s any ﬂun. The profes-
sors don’t even wear beards! But
if you hear a lot of banging on tin
pans under the platform next tap
day, look‘ for me. It’s an old WUP
tradition.

New Books Placed
