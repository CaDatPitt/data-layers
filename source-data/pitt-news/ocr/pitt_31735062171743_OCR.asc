Kents Attempts Peaceful

by CAROLE COVAL

According to Steven Saville, a
junior at Kent State University,
“about 150” Kent students draft-
ed and signed a letter to their uni-
versity president,_ Robert 1. White,
during a “Bitch-In” session Fri-
day.

This student gripe session was
part of the Peace and Freedom
Week program on Kent’s campus
last week. I

The letter called for an open
forum with the president and
other administrators.

According to the Daily Kent
Stater, the letter said: “In order
to begin to solve the problem of
this campus—lack of communica-
tion—the very same problem that
created last May 4 and is again es-
calating the mood of the campus
to another possible confrontation,
we need an open forum to be at-
tended by President White and
other top administrators.”

The letter said those who wrote
it “feel that a lack of constructive

‘response to this letter will only

serve to further widen the already
strained communication gap be-
tween administrators and stu-
dents.”

The letter termed the forum re-

K

quest as a ‘reasonable offer to
improve communications.”

Saville told the Pitt News that
there are several issues which
students at Kent feel should be
discussed and explained in an
open forum.

These issues range from -a
statement by the president on the
Laotian invasion to a reschedul-
ing of dormitory visitation hours.

Sué Zimmerman, editor of the
Daily Kent Stater elaborated on
the communication problem ex-
isting between administration and
students. “The president only
meets with small groups of stu-
dents or makes a statement over
WKSU, the Kent State radio sta-
tion,” she said.

Saville said that students are
questioning why two students
were apprehended after chalking
on a sidewalk. The students ‘were
part of a crowd that ralled on Feb.
5 against the United States action
in Laos. \

Zimmerman said, “If they were
members of the pep club, I’m sure
they wouldn’t have gotten into
trouble.”

“Other issues students would
like clarified,” Saville said, “are
the three addition indictments in

with one testimony to the con-

Urban Affairs--A New I
Interdisciplinary Field g

Students in the Urban
Studies major here will man
the information booth in the
Student Union Monday, Tues-

day, Thursday and Friday of ‘

this week to explain, describe,
and answer questions about
this interdisciplinary field.

Suzann Slyman, majoring in
Urban Studies, describes this
new field as one “basically for
students concerned with the
problems of the city.” It only
demands that students want to
know “what and a little bit of
the why” about city life.

“A prerequisite for this new

major, is, of course, an interest .

7

in people,’ she said. “You must
be willing to work with people in
order to understand why poverty
and urbanization make the city
dweller a special kind of person.

The Urban Studies major takes

a look at city education, govern- A I

ment, economics, politics, geo-
graphy, and, most importantly,
people.

Since most of the course work
lies within the bounds of estab-
lished departments, Urban
Studies is defined as an “interdis-
ciplinary field.”

Professor Bryan Vargus, act-
ing chairman of this “almost-a—
department,” urges students to
educate themselves in the “whole
picture” of the city life;

“Although Urban Studies is not
a training for a specific job, Pro-
fessor Vargus said, “It will pro-

’ 9

people out of the courtroom and
beat them in the antechamber.”

Other testimony stated that
“police pushed aside short-haired
people to get at the ‘longhairs,”’
and remarked to one another,
“Did you get your hits in?”

Greek Image Changing},

Mary Jan Trunzo, the new Pan-
Hellenic president, sees potential
energies and services in the
Greek System. Last year Trunzo
served as project chairman for
Pan-Hel. She explained, “My in-
volvement with project planning
really opened my eyes -to com-
munity areas. I hope that the
Greek system can extend its serv-
ices even deeper into the com-
munity.” v

Trunzo feels that the image of
the Greek system is changing to-
ward one unified body instead of
separate fraternities andsoror-
ities. “Unification is our strong-
est means of projecting our serv-
ices and showing that Greeks are
not oriented to social
alone,” Trunzo maintained.

“I think that the Greek system
has been stereotyped, just as the
women’s movement has been
largely misunderstood,” Trunzo
continued, “and one way to cor-
rect worn-out images, I think, is
to establish a sense of collecti-
vism.”

vide a student with a well-round-
ed perspective of the social, eco--
nomic and political problems that
an urban community faces.

“Urban Studies will give the
,city school teacher, social work-
er, politician, policeman and ad-
ministrator a flexible background
as well as an awareness of those
‘Big City’ problems that people
face daily,” he said.

SUZANN SLYMAN

Since the creation of the Model
Cities, Urban Redevelopment and
several other newly-funded urban
projects, “city dedicated” people
have been recruited to work for
ghetto renovation, community ed-
ucation, and legal service.

Students in the Urban Studies
major augment their courses with
those in the CAS category. Be-

“Urban Studies requirements .
do not hinder the interdisciplinary _
aspect of the major,” said Vargas. “
Fifteen to 18 credits in 109 level-5
courses in various Social Science -
departments are required after
six to nine credits in introductory
courses. A minimum of 12 credits‘
to be distributed between inde-
pendent research, seminars, ‘and,
field study is the remaining «re-» 1
quirement. It is also possible, -
though, to substitute course work”?
for the research and seminar ac-
tivity.

Bramhall, one of a group of fac--3
ulty and students who initiated ‘the. *
Urban Studies major program, is
acting advisor to interested stu-
dents. He and Vargus describe the _"
program as “stillsbeing born.” '

  us Shelters B

uilt

Despite Red Tape

by MARLENE ZNOY
In February, 1970, the Com-
muter Association (CA) pro-

posed to the administration the
construction of two bus shelters
at a cost of $3,800. One year lat-
er, after considerable delay with-
in three bureaucracies and at a
cost of $15,000, both of the shel-
ters have finally been construct-

. ed.

Tom gainan, president of the
Commuter Association, considers
the construction of the bus shel-
ters “the first visible achieve-
ment for the commuters.”

Daniel McFadden, executive
assistant to Vice-Chancellor Ko-
bosky, reiterated Gainan’s com-
ment: “This was a significant
and tangible accomplishment for
the Commuter Association.”

The administration accepted
the CA proposal in March, but,
from May through October, pro-
gress was delayed by the city
in an attempt by the University
to get a variance of a zoning
law. Meanwhile, construction
costs had gone up. The arrival
of parts was delayed until mid-
January by a railroad strike.

According to Gainan, the CA
was instrumental in getting ac-
tion on the bus shelters: “We
can claim credit by the fact that
we kept prodding the adminis-
tration. It was frustrating at
times.”

Gainan indicated that the ad-
ministration was powerless
throughout much of the bus shel-
ter delay. “The administration
could not influence the city or
the construction company,” he
explained. -

“Actually, there’s not much
the administration can do for us,
except possibly in the ara of

housing,” Gainan said. The CA,
along with Committees Com-
missioner Wade Lawson, is pro-
posing to the administration a
plan for over-night dormitory
facilities for commuters.

The commuter president ex-
pects that the next important
effort by the CA will be for
more social activities for com-

muters. A dance held recently_

by the commuters attracted 300
students.

Gainan’s intent is to “make
the commuter feel as though he
belongs.”

Daniel McFaden played a
major role in the preliminary
stages of the bus shelter pro-
ject by getting University approv-
al and funding.

Asked if the administration
felt pressured by the CA, Mc-
Fadden replied, “No. Every-
thing has to have a beginning,
and the Commuter Association
took the initiative. They re-
quested the money and the Uni-
versity funded it.”

McFadden said that, though
the administration felt that the
bus shelters were a good idea and
the commuters were justified
in their request, he doubts that
the University would have con-
structed the sites had they not
been proposed by the CA.

'Kobosky’s assistant also said
that if moremoney had initially
been requested, the project may
have had a more difficult time
getting approval.

“The major problems were
impatience and delay,“ McFad-
den said. “But I can understand
the impatience more. It getts
pretty cold and windy out
there."

They are presently collecting
course descriptions from other
universities in an attempt to in-
tegrate the best possible program
in Urban Studies here at Pitt.

"Since we are an urban Univer-
sity," said Vargus, “we feel’we
must be responsible to the city.
We hope to provide top notch grad-
uates who have the specialized
perception and flexibility to work
effectivelv within the city."

Body Posture Important

by CAROLE COVAL

Dr. William S. Condon, pioneer in the field
of Non-Verbal Communications was the guest
speaker Friday, at the Psychology department
Colloquium held in Crawford Hall.

Students, graduates, and faculty filled the
lecture room to hear Condon outline the tech-
niques and implications involved in the study of
body language.

“We hide our true meanings behind our
voice," he said, “but the body allows true mean-
ings to show through in the form of facial ex-
pression or body-actions. "

“There is a link between speaker and listen-
er, also,” he said. “The listener moves in isomet-
ric configuration with the body posture of the
speaker.”

“A person assumes the posture of another
person in relation to the extent he is willing to
communicate with him,” Condon observed.

Two people who are carrying on a friendly

Pgh. 5

(Continued from Page 1)

conversation can be observed rhythmically
changing posture and nearly simultaneously
“dancing” in synchrony with each other.

Condon demonstrated his observarions by
showing slow motion films of several types of
interactions.

Condon believes that “the action“ occurs in
“word, phrase, sentence, and even sylable group-
ings or speech and behavior.”

In the first filmed interaction that Condon
showed to the audience, an interview between a
male employer and perspective female secretary
showed that the two people were obviously
attracted to each other because of their synchron-
ized body movements.

Both simultaneously shared posture, ‘and
moved in what Condon terms as “courting
dance.” I

“The study of non-verbal communication em-
phasizes the fact that what lies behindand beyondour
speech is vitally important," Condon said.

Paul Boas, a spokesman from
the Law Commune stated, “This
civl action, opposing the criminal
charges, is attempting to show
through these testimonies and
through statements from people
involved in other demonstrations,
such as the Grap and Lettuce Boy-
cotts and various anti-war pro-
tests, that there has been a bad
faith usage of the state legal pro-
cesses, whether through harrass-
ment, arrest, or attempt to ar-
rest."

“Another aim of the case,” Boas-

continued, "is to establish that
there has been a chilling effect
created, intimidating people from
expressing their first amendment
rights.” '

UNIVERSITY SENATE

“Pitt has one of the oldest
university senates in the na-
tion. Established in 1941, it is
an important -advisory and
consulting body which, until
recently, has been largely con-
cerned with expressing the
faculty viewpoint on a broad
range of institutional matters,
such as academic freedom and
tenure, faculty health and wel-
fare, athletics, computer us-
age, educational policies, and
student affairs.

“Among the specific matters of
importance which were consider-
ed by the Senate last year were
these:

“The Senate recommended, and
the University administration and
trustees subsequently approved,
a formal procedure for establish-
ing advisory search committees
for the identification of candidates
for deanship and other important
University academic positions.

“The, Senate" committed itself
to the support of equal rights and
opportunities for women and min-
orities, and served as an impor-
tant forum for the discussion of
affirmative action programs de-
signed to eliminate social injus-

‘ tices.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS

“Always ‘conscious of the grow-

institution and its various exter-

devoted a great deal of time and
energy this past year to its rela-

the local community and its alum-

Vice Chancellor of Program De-

“A special ‘Legislative Day’

University facilities, met with
faculty, administrators and stu-

Future of Polish Uncertain

by STEVE ZYCH

“My greatest fear is that Polish
will be phased out after I leave
this term,” stated Dr. Frank
Mocha, visiting professor from
Columbia's Slavic Department.

Dr. Mocha recently received
his Ph.D. in Russian Literature
there and is now leaving for a new
position in either Wisconsin or
New York.

“Five years ago when I came
here from Columbia, I found that
Polish was taught in the ‘evening
only on an alternate year basis.
Immediately, I took steps to have
this changed to an every year bas-
is which I am happy to say is the
situation today,” said Dr. Mocha.

“This term I am teaching, not
one, but three different levels of
Polish, in addition to my litera-
ture courses, and I have a total
enrollment of 52 language stu-
dents. This represents a 100 per
cent increase since the abolition
of the language requirement and
a 20 per cent increase over last
term,” remarked Dr. Mocha.

Dr. Mocha also noted that his
five years here saw not only a
change in the size of the enroll-
ment but also in the makeup of
the classes themselves. “Whereas
five years ago the typical student
was a part-time student of Polish
background, today I have stu-
dents of many different national-
ities and all but two of my 52 lan-
guage students are in degree pro-
grams or doing post-doctoral
work."

The two, Lou Radkowski, a mor-
ticiam, and George Ireland, a
plant engineer, indicated that the
reason they use their time off to
come to Polish class'is “because
of a strong desire to learn to

. speak the language.”

A breakdown of the other 50 stu-
dents shows that the majority of
them are full-time undergrads in

      

the College of Arts and Sciences.
The roster also includes two
Ph.D.’s preparing for post-doc-
toral work involving Polish schol-
arship, 13 graduate students, two
of whom are Ph.D. candidates,
and four General Studies students.

“Thus I have seen an expansion

9.3%,

of interest in the Polish language
to many levels of academi pur-
suit, and it is withva feeling of re-
gret and fear that I leave this Uni-
versity,” said Dr. Mocha.

He feels regret at not being
able to see the program grow and.
develop further and fears that the
program will be phased out be-
cause of a lack of interest on the

part of the department or be-
cause of a lack of funds.

According to Dr. N. P. Po1tor-
atzky, chairman of the Slavic De-
partment, the department plans
to to “retain all present Polish
classes as long as there are avail-
able funds.”

Drug culture cannot be considered a

and opium enjoyed popularity long
before marijuana and heroin ever did.

' The degree to which drugs are abused

Editor's Note: The following memo
has been forwarded to all faculty and
students at the University by the Uni-

‘ versity Senate's Committee on Common-

wealth Relations. Initially ‘submitted on

lfebruary 3, it has been signed by Chair-

woman Caryl Kline,
tinuing Education for

Director of Con-
Women and ,Dr.

‘Robert Newman of the Speech Depart-

men t. ‘

As you may recall, prior to the start
of the current fiscal year, last July.
the University requested an appropria-
tion from the Commonwealth of some
-$45-million. The legislature , subsequently
appropriated for Pitt $18.9-million——half
the amount of last year’s appropriation-
as an interim measure until a new
state funding program could be passed.

In light of this, the University raised
its tuition last fall, reducing the re-

‘ vmaining amount of Commonwealth fund-
. ing required to approximately $24-million.

At its last meeting in January, the Uni-
versity’s Board of Trustees authorized
the administration to borrow up to this

amount in order to complete the fiscal

year. This borrowing program will begin
next month.

Governor Shapp is pressing for en-

, llactment of a tax package for the Com-

monwealth by March 1. It is antici-
pated that, shortly thereafter, the General

in American society. Alcohol‘

in contemporary American society.
however, is novel. The results of drug

abuse are particularly apparent and ap- I

palling in the ghetto. Heroin addiction
has become a major problem in the
Hill District.

Heroin, or "Smack". has its effect
on both the Black junkie and the Black
community. The businesses of Black en-
trepreneurs on the hill are dying fast.

Frank Ellis, owner of the Ellis Hotel
on Center Avenue, and Brady Keyes,
formerly of the Pittsburgher Steelers,
now President of “All-Pro Enterprises”
(a fried chicken franchise), are trying
with little success to combat the prob-
lem.

According to Ellis and Keyes, junk-
ies on the street have been driving
black dollars out of the ghetto. Many
adults they said are afraid to shop in
Herron Hill for fear of being jumped,
beaten, and robbed by junkies and
hoodlums.

Ellis claims that heroin is brought
into the hill three dimes a day by car
and as many as 25 pushers and junkies
gather around each time to pick up or
buy their smack.

Public Sale
Public places (particularly bath-

rooms) serve as pick—up points for the
junkie. Junkie and pusher meet, money

lBorrowing Set for March

Assembly will act on an appropriation
for the University — possibly an 18-month
appropriation to carry us through the
remainder of fiscal 1970-71 and all of
1971-72.

While we do not expect this appro-
priation to be generous enough to pro-
vide the University with a substantial
growth factor, we do not anticipate that
we will face the kind of financial
crisis that we faced last year, or the
major cutbacks in programs that have
been experienced by other institutions
of higher learning around the country.

This would seem to indicate that we .

will not experience another crash cam-
paign to explain the University’s needs
to the legislature. Nevertheless, there
is a need for continuing contacts with
legislators by members of the University
community to reduce the tremendous gap
of misunderstanding which separates the
University and the legislature.

As Chancellor Posvar pointed out re-
cently, in his annual report, higher edu-
cation is experiencing a "crisis of public
confidence” which can affect its fund-
ing seriously in an era when costs
continue to spiral and the demand for
educational services continues to grow.
It is incumbent on us to do what we
can to remove this lack of confidence.

changes hands, and the junkie is told
where he can find his stuff.

Small children have become in-.
creasingly popular as. transfer vehicles.
The child takes a small package (nearly
always disguised) from pusher to junkie
and is rewarded with a dime or some
candy; The pusher’s sophistication is
his protection. -

Keyes and Ellis have met with little
success in securing the assistance of the
police department’s narcotics division
in dealing with the problem. They manag-
ed to draw the attention of the “Pittsburgh
Press” and an article appeared in early
January. To their dismay, the only action
taken came in the form of a few arrests
made the next day.

These gentlemen are convinced, and
with some justification, that organized
crime is ultimately responsible for the.
distribution and sale of hard-core nar-
cotics and that support or organized
crime must exist in positions of impor-
tance within government at local, state,
and federal levels.

The government power structure is
predominantly white and consequently
heroin addiction is viewed by the black
entrepreneur as a means toward continued
subserviance of the black man——economic-
ally, politically, socially.

Huet: Life in

by BARRY J. SCHLACHTER

During a time when there are no
shortages and one can easily purchase a
new automobile or the latest clothing,
contemplating the true consequences
of a war is nearly impossible.

.People are awakened for as short

while when the media handles a story

of shocking proportions, such as the
Mylai or Kent State massacres. Other
than these special times the war seems
forgotten. Forgotten except by those fam-
ilies who lose a son killed in action.
To these people and their friends the
harsh realities of war are brought home.

When someone you know is killed,
the war becomes very close.

This past week a friend of mine was
killed in Laos. His name was Henri Huet,
an Associated Press photographer. He
spent the greater part of two decades in
Indochina photographing the brutal
action and the unending suffering of peo-
ple at war.

Huet first came to Indochina in 1949
with the French Army. A recent graduate
from an art school, he enlisted so that
he would be able to visit his father in
Saigon whom he had not seen in ten
years. The French army trained him as
a combat photographer. When his en-
listment ran out, he chose to remain in
Vietnam.

  ‘HII’ Drug Abuse llndermining Progress, Dignity ,

Complex Problem

Keyes, who is a member of the Presi-
der'1t‘s Commission on Drug Abuse, and
Ellis, who has spent nearly 30 years
building a successful business in the
Hill District, both realize the complex-
ity of the heroin addiction problem in
the ghetto.

For the junkie. smack represents a
psychological and physical escape
from the degradation of the ghetto; and,
for the pusher, smack represents an eco-
nomic escape from the poverty of the
ghetto.

Existing legal and penal systems are
inadequate, poorly implemented, and
misdirected in dealing with the problem.
The junkie and often the pusher suffer
while the supplier reaps a fat profit.

The two-men warn that drug abuse in
the ghetto has reached frightening pro-
portions and that the problem can only
grow worse unless things change,’ dras-
tically and quickly.

, Heroin addiction and its social side
effects will not be eliminated by
militarist actions or brutal, dehumaniz-
ing punishments, but rather by the cre-
ation of an atmosphere in which Ameri-
can Blacks can live in dignity.

Photographs 

He has been wounded several times,
the last seriously, requiring hospitaliza-
tion and a long convalescence in France.
Afterwards he _spent a peaceful year
with the AP Tokyo Bureau.

Over‘ coffee he told me about his
years in Vietnam, and the senseless-
ness of the war. After the massacre at
Mylai was brought into the open, it did
not surprise him. What did was the fact
that South Vietnam’s President Thieu
kept denying it ever happened even after
Nixon had admitted the slaying indeed

occurred.
“That ‘fuckin' Thieu did not care if’

his own countrymen were slaughtered,"
Huet said in his salty, French-accented
English.

His most famous photograph appear-
ed in Life magazines review of the ‘60’s.
It showed a blinded GI medic adminis-
tering first-aid to a wounded comrade.

In the news dispatch announcing his l“

death it mentioned that he had received
the Capa award in 1967 for “superlative
still photography requiring exceptional
courage and enterprise.” AP said the
award reflected Huet’s “quiet bravery
and fine photography.”

Though combat photographers seldom
grow old, their best photographs may
prolong their memory. Henri Huet, dead
at the age of 43, will be remembered.

_ Everything complemented the
_ spectacle. The women stood
around chattily in illegitimate
gold and silver dresses and order-
ed drinks from waiters tatooed
' with an embroidered Duquesne
Club emblem on their should-
 ers. The men swapped anecdotes
37-.~‘~ with their fellows and chuckled
" in the low subdued tones of the
very wealthy. ‘

Three massive chandeliers
swayed gently overhead and
threw flickers of light against
the brocaded walls. They reflect-
ed into the second gin and tonic
of the last 20 minutes sitting in
my hand.

_. As far as male-restricted, fil-
:—-- thy-rich institutions go, the Duq-
i ‘ uesne Club is “very important
in the district" and ‘_‘international

in scope", according to the in-
formation I managed to squeeze

from an official but reluctant

‘ -source.

  

“Why are you having the din-
ner here? They don't even allow
women to join?” I asked my
host, the representative of one of
the oldest women’s groups in the
city.”

“O, it’s a tradition. We al-
ways have it here.”, she said.

“Oh,” I said, gulping the
rest of my drink and offering to
finish hers.

The ‘dinner came in seven
parts, most of which I can't pro-
nounce. Of the three glasses of
white wine (which, of course,
came with the filet mignon) I
spilled only one onto the golden
inlaid china emblasoned with the
DC monogram.

“It’s nice to have women here.
A few years ago, you wouldnt
have been able to get in the
back door,“ remarked the sole
male at our table.

“Aren't we lucky." l yelled in

' an alcoholic boom .

Wine Came with the Filet Mignon

After testimonials and a couple
of drinks-to-everybody’s-health,
four of us decided to save expen-
ses and save harrassment by tak-
ing a cab home. This entailed
using the telephone.)

“You have to charge the call to
a Club member,” the operator
said cheerfully.

“But I don't" know anyone
here,” Iinsisted.

“I’m sorry, Miss. But I have
to do this.”

“But, I don‘t know anyone at -

all that would belong to the Duq-

uesne Club, operator . . . . 0.
wait. . . . how about Wesley Pos-
var?“

“We can‘t do that, Miss.“

We finally settled on a com-
promise,candidate and I got
through to Yellow Cab Co. By
the time. I reached the entrance,
15 feet from the carpeted private
telephone booth. the cab had
pulled up outside. The driver
gave us a confused look. but
agreed to ride us home, anyway.

”Negr0” ----

White Word

Greetings Sister Diane
(Washington 1.

I am writing you this letter to
congratulate you on the fine arti-
cle you wrote in The Pitt News.
“The Difference Between Negro
and Black.” Brother El, Hadd
Malik El, Shabazzs has been quot-
ed as saying “when you teach a
man, you taught an individual, but
when you taught a women you
taught a nation.” Your article is
a good example of what the good
Bro. El, Hadd Malik El Shabbazz
meant. ’

What you stated in your article
will gain more acceptance by
them so called Negro and make
them start thinking about the
term Negro. which is dereogative
and negative in meaning. If my-
self or another Black Brother

would have said the same thing.

the first thing them so-called lib-
eral minded folks would have said
is there goes a bunch of irrespo;
sible Blacks trying to incite there
racist ideology.

Bro. Frantz Fanon has this to
say about Negro’s, "Negros is
something created by white
America.“ What I interpreted this
Brother to mean is that Negros
are something that were created
out of opression. repression. col-
onization. indoctrination. If you
study at length the character of
the Negro you will see everything
it does is done to increase the
ideology of the white supremist
and increase the financial posi-
tion of the white establishment.

'1‘ake the Negro Elites or Bour-
ogesie, they have the same stan-
dards that has been embedded in
the minds of our peoples The
only thing the middle class whites
values is material objects and
will do anything to obtain materi-
al status.

A lot of the so-called Negros
will never accept the terminology
of being called Blacks because the
transition from Black to Negro
is a hard one for those that have
obtained any material status. Be-
ing Black means you have com-
pletely divorced yourself from the
values that have been made ac-
cording to the likes and wants of
white America. I ‘

Black means you have learned
to love self and recognize your
own original Black history as be-
ing something beautiful and not
primitive as white America has
painted it to being.

 

It is obvious that the white rul-
ing class of America has com-
pletely forgot what our ancestors.

men. Nubians. Hottentots. con-
tributed to the building of Ameri-

ples just stated are Black.

Supplement:
Pure Trash

Editor, The Pitt News:
When the decision was made

not to be “eight paged into obli-.

vion“ was a vote also taken as to
the quality of writing on addition-
al pages? In Wednesdays Pitt
News we were presented with a
four page supplement which

- amounted to the worst collection

of trash journalism seen this year.

With remarkable lack of taste.
we were privileged to see car-
toons of the Statue of Liberty
burning down Vietnames villages
and Melvin Laird as some sort of
priest whose duty it is to annihi-
late draftees on the altar of Viet-
nam.

Mr. Ging wrote two articles.
one about the horrors of war and
violence (quite profound) and then
said that in order to end the war
in Vietnam. we may be forced to
use violence.

Granting the infamous beha-
vior of the U.S. Governmentfit
does not seem to add to the health
of this country to print the weird.
irrational arguments presented
on Wednesday.

It would give a political scien-
tist great pause to try to figure
out page eight‘s headline: “If gov-
ernment won‘t stop war. then
Tvell stop government."

The suggestion that The Pitt
News expand its paper size was
a good one-provided that some
modest attempt at quality jour-
nalism is published.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I hereby propose that every

ate be open to the general public.
The last such meeting tolerated
one of the most dramatic bladder

emptyings every to occur on the.

Pitt campus. namely, that of Prof.
Lawrence Lee. Such an amusing
spectacle would have enlivened
the existences of many an Oak-
land resident. It is not often that
one has the opportunity to witness
the frantic reaffirmation of 15th
century educational ideas.

Prof. Lee‘s view of the Univer-
sity in society seems to be that of
an uiireconstructed traditionalist.
to wit. the University is a vast‘pig-
sty. wherrein the student. as pig.
is molded. shaped. directed. fat-
tened, herded. and prepared for
slaughter by the professor. as au-
thoritarian pig—sty attendant.

Prof. Lee seems to fear a de-
parture from this norm like an
old dirt farmer fears a shift from
manual outhouses to automated
toilets.

The comedy murder-mystery Catch Me If You
Can, currently at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, is a
rather entertaining affair. Although its “given-it-
away-toopsoon" plot and “Why did the chicken cross
the street?” comic material is in no way conducive
to a well twisted myster . . . it, however, lands it-
self very well as a somewhat defective type of “Neil
Simon” theatre that’s perfect for after dinner, a
marvelous chaser——post your favorite cocktail, or
just tantalizing enough to put the movies off for one
more night. ’

The trouble with this whodunnit myster is that
it takes too long to get where its going. Jack Wein-
stock and Willie Gilbert’s adaption of Robert Thom-
as’ French comedy Piege Pour un Homme Seul only
survives because it comes to a conclusion as a mur-
der—mystery should.

WAITING——A CHALLENGE

The challenging part is waiting for all of the
surprise and excitement that doesn't evolve fully
until the last 20 minutes of the show. It is “light-
light” murder-mystery and although there is enough
to keep one entertained, there is not enough to give
the thrills of the chase . . . that quick pace, or those
twists of surprise that comprise the particular type
of fare that “Catch Me . .  is supposed to hold in
store.

The comic material in the show is largly of the
Jewish accent and intonation type :' “So what did
you expect . . .?” In this instance it is rather paltry
humor when it isn’t cheap imitation. If you haven’t
been exposed to this particular brand of “chicken”
humor for too long, you’ll be able to laugh along with
everyone else “Oh no! . . . ha, ha?” It is never-the-
less funny. It’s who you’re laughing at that will
probably determine how much you go along with it.

The fun in this type of mystery is most always
provided by the dete tive. Here is where the eve-
ning gets a real lift. Will Disney’s “Jewish Sleuth"
characterization xounces along with just the right
amount of zip and feeling, making the stereotype is
for some reason enjoyable.

FINE DIRECTION

Disney’s direction is rather fine also. Although
there was some awkward blocking here and there,
he has staged this show holding things appropriate-
ly taut- Although the show itself reveals too much
too soon, Disney holds the reigns on most of the ma-
terial quite well, getting much out of everything

_ that there to play with.

The talented cast that has been selected is an-
other point in favor of this Playhouse production.

They not only do great justice to their roles, but“

compliment each other very nicely.

In addition to Inspector Levine (Will Disney) is
Sorale Leven (Mrs. Corban) who is charmingly de-
ceiving as the “is she or isn’t she . . . wife." Joe

Ideas and Figures

A Magazine

by CINDY MORGAN
Assistant Entertainment Editor

If you walked up to the average student on campus and asked them
“What is Ideas and Figures?” you would probably receive some good
guesses, and for the most part, blank stares and a puzzled “I dunno ! 

The prize winning magazine of the liberal arts‘. has been around
for a long time, plblishing its tight booklet of some of the campus‘ best
prose, poetry, and photography. ..

The Winter 1971 edition, on sale this week in the Towers Lobby, 416
Student Union and other points across the University, is the best issue I
have seen of the magazine in the past three years.

As you leaf through the 66 pages, you will find a very clean and
appealing lay-out. The photography, layed out primarily by ex-bussi-
ness manager Marcus Zolnier, shows talent and a discerning eye, even
though this is his second piece of work. It beautifully compliments the
surrounding poetry, and many of the pictures were done so that they
blended into the page.

The photography and art illustrations were done by Jerry McCav-
itt, Fred Bragg, Mark Bullwinkle and Tommy Lee.

Lee, also known for his prize-winning ability on the flute, has dem-
onstrated his abilities as a fine photographer. Characteristic of his
work is varyingand often unusual composition, and the great contrast

Through the joint effort of the Office of the Provost and the
Chancellor's Advisory Council On Women-’s Opportunities,
questionnaires have been designed to elicit the opinions of
women students, staff, and faculty on their perceptions re-
garding their status as women at the University. Since this
is the first comprehensive ‘attempt to employ women's opin-
ions in the formulation of policy directly affecting them as
a group, it is essential that all wqimen complete the ques-
tionnaires, which they will soon receive in the mail. Com-
pleted questionnaires should be returned as quickly as pos-
sible to the Provost's Office, except in the case of dorm stu-
dents who should return them to their R.A.’s. NOTE: English
department faculty, and students maioring in English should
note that the check list accompanying the questionnaires
omits their department in the code listings. Those persons
should write ”English” where appropriate.

he receives between his subjects and background.

Mark Bullwinkle’s woodcuts and etchings are very intricate and
distinctive. Jerry McCavit seems to have chosen nature as his theme
and his works are creatively done and lend the magazine sparkle.

My particular ar favorites are the paintings and drawings by Fred
Bragg. The artist has captured realism in his drawings, primarily of
faces of the young and old. and black.

The bulk of the magazine is primarily poetry, however one lengthy
prose piece, “Prospero’s Dream of Distinction" was also printed. Its
author John Heyda, is a graduate student and also is teaching in the
English department. His piece is excellent, but very heavy material.
Most students will probably skip it over, but it is one of those things
that you can put away and save for when you have more time.

The poetry varies both in content and style, from Brady Moore’s
traditional haikus, to much lengthier and less-structured verse.

My particular favorites are Keith Mi1ton’s Le Faon en Hiver and
Al Grover Armstrong’s The Peom and Agatha.

Like all collections, you probably won’t like everything in the light
of individual tastes. I do think, however, that everyone will choose a
particular favorite and will find the magazine a welcome addition to
their personal library.

It is the sad task of the theatre critic to chronicle “The passing

of time in theatre.” Such is the case with not onlylthe media itself
if (evolution——change-—révolution) but of the actors, technicians, and
 5 designers who make and have made the theatre come alive.

TOM DAVEY, one of the more active performers at the Studio
7l]iTheatre, was tragically killed in an automobile accident this past
weekend. A product of the Pitt campus at Greensburg,‘Tom began
his studies in Pittsburgh only last fall. #7

 and most recently A Short Day's Anger. In each of his roles he came ‘

across as a talented. and skilled performer. F -

Off the state, his individuality stood out. His gentle, yet,effec--
tive m_anner—his love of nature-—-his whole life style-—won for him

STUDENT AFFAIRS

“The major effort in the stu—.

sity during the past year has been
to establish improved communi-
cations arriong students, adminis-
tration, faculty, trustees and the
public. Much of this has been ac-

But other student groups,
such as the Student Affairs Advi-

with the Chancellor and the senior
administrative officers of the
(University.

“The Pitt student body contin-
ues to be a cosmopolitan and bet-
erogeneous one. The Offices of
Admission and Student Aid have
combined their efforts to assure
that there is, adequate represen-
tation of racial and ethnic minor-
ities, as well as students from
other states and nations.

"Last year, approximately 89
per cent of the Pitt student body

ATHLETICS
"The University offers its stu-

dents a diverse academic and and V

intramural athletic program. Al-

thoughphysical education no long- '

er is /a- required course for under-
graduates at the University, last
year approximately 1,500 men and
1,200 women took physical ed-
ucation courses, and some 1,200

also provided.’ I

“Pitt has a proud. tradition in
intercollegiate athletics, and in
the past few years has undertak-
en major efforts to upgrade these
sports, including football, basket-
ball, swimming,‘ track and other
events, while maintaining the aca-
demic standards that Pitt athletes
must meet. In 1969-70, approxi-
mately 400 students participated
in more than 150 A competitive
events in 13 sports.’ Pitt teams
produced their best overall ath-
letic record of the past 11 years,
and the first winning sports year
since 1962-62. ‘

PHYSICAL PLANT
“The University plans to build

a large residential complex on

land which it already owns on the
hillside near Pitt Stadium. Un-

accommodated in a suite consist-
ing of combination sleeping and
study areas, a lounge, and self-
contained bathroom facilities. The
suites also will be designed so that
they can be converted to use by
married students or faculty.

When they are completed, the
University's ,,available housing
supply will be increased by more
than one—third, from approximate-
ly 3,000 beds at present. One un-
usual aspect of the residence
structure will be a large escalator
system which will connect the
housing site, atop a steep hill-
side, to academic areas of the‘
University on the lower campus.
The escalator will "pass through
the LRDC building and a ‘living-
learning’ center which will be
built on the lower hillside. This
project will open up previously
unused acreage within the Cam- 9
pus for housing development in
order to eliminate the need for
acquisition of land for this pur— 
pose which would disrupt neigh- 5
boring areas.

Pitt swimming coach. Bill
Grant resigned Wednesday for
"health and personal reasons“
and most of the swimmers who
quit the squad have returned.

Assistant Coach Dick Brad-
shaw was appointed as acting
coach for the rest of the season,
and Grant remains on the pay-
roll.

“I agreed to coach the team
for the rest of the season be-
cause Coach Grant asked me
to,” explained Bradshaw. “We
have worked together closely
for the last few years, and when
he requested me to finish off
the season I agreed."

Lack of recruiting was one
of the swimmers complaints
about Grant.

Bradshaw has started recruit-
ing already. He said that he met
with a few swimmers last week
and will talk to others today.

“We really have only half
the size of a naormal team,"

Replacements Handle 
Cornell Grap Squad

by MIKE MILLER

The wrestlers managed a 28-6
victory over Cornell Saturday,
despite the absence of eightof
ten of the regular starters. They
host West Virginia tomorrow
night at the Field House.

Pitt Coach Dave Adams put
his junior varsity team into most
of the positions against Cornell
and was extremely pleased with
the results.

“The guys who wrestled were
second and third string men who
stayed out for the team and got
their opportunity to wrestle,"
Adams said. “It is a real credit
to them. They deserved to win.

“The biggest disappointment
was the crowd. They weren’t
even giving these guys a
chanceﬂ’

The fans numbered about 250, .

the smallest wrestling crowd
ever, according to the coach. .

Cornell has managed only a
1-8 record as of Saturday. The
Big Red has been having depty
problems. They were forfeiting
three weight class per match
before meeting Pitt. -

They only forfeited one
match, Saturday, in the 190
pound class.

Pitt’s line-up problems were
complicated by the loss of
Bud Smeltz, Craig Tritch,
Dave Young and Bob Kuhn.

Smeltz and Tritch are pos-
sibly out for the season. Smeltz
has suffered a pinched nerve
and Tritch pulled a ligament in
his knee.

Young has missed two matches
due to a bout with the flue, and
Kuhn will be sidelined for at
least a week with a shoulder in-
jury.

Kuhn was injured at Franklin
and Marshall and was expected
to miss at least four weeks.
The injury" is not as serious as
originally thought, and Kuhn is
expected back for the Syracuse
match Saturday. '

The 142 pound match has
been the most exciting match at
the Field House this year and
though Bud Smeltz. who usually
fills the position, was sidelined.

"They asked me to swim since
it looks good for us. So I‘m in

won't swim the rest of the sea-

Why did the swimmers return?

Morris explained, “The main
reason why we quit has been
eliminated, so we're back with
high hopes. The team is really
sticking together and has a lot

In regard to another point that
the swimmers had protested,
the line-up, Bradshaw remarked
“They’ll know approximately two ,
out of the three event’s they’ll‘ ‘
be swimming. There should be
a certain amount of flexibility
so they can change their think-

them to. However, they will
have a line-up before the meet.”

Practice was.held Saturday and
Sunday to get the swimmers in
shape for the upcoming meet.
The coach explained that the
teams missed a few days of prac-
tice this week.

Bradshaw described the team
as enthusiastic and believes that
the swimmers look good, even
though it would take six weeks
to get them in shape. “The boys
will do the best they can through-
out the season, but we're gear-

Fitzgerald Field House attendance figures of late have ~
been questioned by many. It's said that the totals announced

Bu whatever the crowd totaled, it was disheartening to

The Pitt wrestling line-up has unbelievably 1 been de—,-7?
pleted by numerous misfortunes, mostly injuries. Because
of them, only two pre-season regulars wrestled Saturday.
And Adams scratches his head and shruggs in near-bewilder--

ment when questioned about the trouble he’s had. R

“Something a log of people also forget about is that we
lost Joe Schantz in that accident last summer," he said yes-
terday.

Schantz was killed in an auto accident in late July“. 
Though he wasn’t counted on as a regular, his tragedy‘ iii
signaled the beginning of many woes which have reduced
the grap line-up to mostly second and third stringers. A

“If they (fans) are staying away because of the line-up,}.~
they’re not giving the guys who are wrestling a chance,”
Adams said Saturday after his second and third stringers gave

Bimbo
Performs

by MARK SIGMON

John ."“Bimbo” Chatman is one helluva wrestler.’ His 93-
1 record through high school attests to that. But even more
important, he is a man who believes in himself.

“Bimbo” was a two—time PIAA state champ at Trinity
H.S. in Washington, Pa. His only loss was to Wade Schalles
(now at‘ Clarion) in the 1969 state finals. Accordingly, it
was not surprising to find that nearly every major university
in the country sought the Washington, Pa. native. The list
included such grappling powerhouses as Oklahoma State,
Iowa State, Michigan State and Michigan.

After gaining his seventh victory of the season against
3 Cornell Saturday night, Chatman has suffered only one set-
V back as a Pitt matman. Last 
. Wednesday, John dropped a
5-2 decision to his arch-nem-
esis, Schalles, at Claron.

“Bimbo” himself admitted _
he was up for the Schalles
match. Although Chatman
was not bothered by the bois-
terous pro-Schalles crowd,
“heblames no one but him-
self for wrestling “a stu-
* pid match” and not being ag-
gressive enough.

Regarding the brief fight
the two grapplers had at the
conclusion of their 158 pound bout and the outbreak that fol-
lowed, Chatman chastised both himself and his opponent for
‘‘losing their cool.”

“Bimbo” added, “If the two of us wrestled again in
the near future, we’d still probably have bad feelings to-
ward one another, but there would not be any more flare-
. ups.”

JOHN CHATMAN

With only three more dual meets to go, John is pointing
to the Eastern Regional. Qualifying Tournament, 'March 12
and 13, at Princeton, and as a result, will be missing spring
vs football. Moreover, since he is a freshman, “Bimbo” will
 not be eligible for the EIWA tourney at Navy, March 5
 and 6.

Chatman will be going down to 150 for bothlthe Penn
State match and the Regionals. At the lower weight, he
I believes he will be a good deal stronger. than most of his
-. foes. In addition, Chatman will be avoiding the taller, and
therefore more leveraged, 159 pounders he has been com-
peting against.

A real crowd-$leaser on the mat, Charman himself
prefers wrestling in front of many fans. However, he intense-
ly disliked the poor manners of the Clarion partisans, and

makes no bones about it.

..“Bim‘bo” and I don't think the defeat bothered me as
-.much as the one in 1969. But what really burned me up was
that Clarion announcer. Upon introducing Schalles, the an-

nouncer‘ said’ . . . the only wrestler ever to beat John Chat-
man, and he’ll do it again tonight.’ That was a bit unsports-
I manlike.to me.” V '

with his high school wrestling coach than he does at the pre-

“sent with Coaches Dave Adams and Dick Slutzky, “Bimbo”

e appreciates the valuable guidance and experience the two
Pitt mentors have.

In Final Moments

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Navy nipped the Pitt ' gymnastic team Sat-
urday in a meet which Coach Warren Neiger dis-
cribed as “a spectator’s delight and a coaches
nightmare.”

A Navy was on top in the final score, 138.05-
135.50, but the meet was up for grabs until the
end. »

Navy was leading by only .35 of a point going
into the final event, horizontal bars. But following
Midshipman Craig Pierce’s second place score of
6.95 points, Dan Campbell said, “that was the
meet.” ‘

Incidentally Campbell captured first place
scoring 7.60 in the event, but that wasn’t enough
in that the team score was two-and-a-half points
less than Navy’s.

Again this week, as in last week’s match
with Massachusetts, the final difference in total

team scores was the difference between the scores.

on the horizontal bar event.

Nieger’s stragegy for the meet was to build
up a strong lead and ‘hope to hold off the Mid-
shipmen.

The floor exercise team started the meet do-pp

ing just this.

Senior Lowell Meek, appearing in Trees Hall
for the last time performed his difficult maneu-
ver with machine-like precision which was re-
‘warded with the outstanding score of 9.4
points. _ ' -

This was the highest score of his career.

Mike Beatty came through with his best per-
formance of the season on the sidehorse, 8.80
points, but it wasn’t enough.

Navy’s John Worthington scored 9.15 points
for first place. —

Navy also earned the top spot on the still
rings via Jack Oswald’s 8.90, but Frank Swift
is continuing to improve," scoring a personal
high of 8.45 points.

Dick Pribis, Beatty and Dave Andrew tied
with identical scores of 8.40 points which was-
n’t enough to catch Jack Oswald.

Oswald captured his second first scoring 8.55
points.

The trio of Chris Gardner, Phil Lilly and
Pribis combined for a team score of 21.45 points

on the parallel bars. But Navy’s trio of Bruce
Spalding, Oswald, and Mike Ash combined for
23.25 points, erasing a two point Pitt lead and set-
ting the stage for the horizontal bar event.

According to Neiger the meet was ‘decided in
three events, sidehorse, rings and vaulting.

The sidehorse team got the outstanding per-
formance of Beatty, but Phil Lilly scored only
8.35 points below’ his past average of 8.6. And
Bob Rogers scored only 5.35 points, well below
his consistant 7.0 score.

On the rings, Jim Bilec came down from last
week’s 8.6 score, and in Vaulting all three of the
performers performed below their average.

The gymnasts are now 2-4 and looking for-
ward to Syracuse who is 0-6.

Smittie Brown In Fastest   SWi1TlIIl€I'S

'600’ Of College Season

Smittie Brown and Jerry Richey, the only two Pitt tracksters
invited to compete in the Mason-Dixon Games in Louisville Satur-

day night, performed quite commendably.

Brown had probably one of the best’ individual performances
by ab Pitt athlete in recent years as he ran the fastest collegiate 600-

yd clash this year.

Last week, Brown expressed his desire to break his own Pitt

record at Louisville.

“I think I’m going to do the
best ti re I’ve ever done in the
600”, he said.

broke the Pitt record, but ran

Since the Mason—Dixon Games

few events,” remarked Brad-
shaw. “I’m not exactly sure what
the lineup will be. They havent
sent us any statistics this season,
but our boys have a good idea of
which events they will partici-
pate in.”

The Grove City coach stated
thathis squad is weak in diving.

“We don’t have anyone like
Wessel and your second diver
(Martin Staleyl is awfully good,”
their coach remarked. “It’ll be
tough to beat your second diver
in the high and low boards.”

Bradshaw remarked in regard
to diving.

“It’s most likely that that's
the event Grove City is aiming
for. When they say something
about your squad they're usually
hoping you’ll slacken off."

Pitt’s women’s gymnastic team
evened ‘their record at 2-2 by
trouncing Youngstown State,
Saturday at Trees Hall, 72.95-

Pitt captured eight out of ‘12
places in the meet including
two firsts, two seconds and four
thirds.

exercise was more than a point

tor, Ginny Fresca, 6.40’

Pitt’s one—three sweep of the
event.

Kathy Krynack and DeMar-

scores of 6.20 and 4.95.

But this time they were fol-
lowed by Jackie Adams of Pitt
who scored 4.65.

Carol Cafrelli on the uneven
parallel bars couldn’t stop
Fresca from her persistant ef-
fort for first place as her score
of 5.75 was only good enough
for second place.

Fresca took youngstown’s
second first place finish, heat-
ing Cafrelli’s 5.75 with a 5.95.

Pitt’s Debbie Gottachall trail-
ed by five hundredths of a point

Pitt’s team score of 72.95 was

Senior Mary Fedorka com-
mented,” that we’ve been im-
proving with every meet. Right
now our main concern is to beat
Slippery Rock, and if we keep
improving we can do it.”

Freshman standout Donna
DeMarino said somewhat the
same thing indicative of the de-
sire of the team to defeat Slip-
pery Rock.

“We still need a lot of work
to beat Slippery Rock but I’m
confident_ that ‘Pitt can beat

This, was unexpected and really
surprising,” commented LaSpada
who’s 253 was second only to
Captain Bill Crooks’ 256 on the
Pitt side of the ledger.

Though they lost, the Pitt
shooters had reason to be opti-
mistic as the 1,249 represented

a twelve point increase in just‘

two weeks and in
and for the first time this
season, ‘three rookies placed
among the top five. Previously
the top five was usually domin-
ated by the lettermen on the
team.

The three, junior Wade Rob-
ertson, sophomore Tim Schmidt
and Freshman Howard Ashbrook,
are among the dozen or so new-
comers upon whom the future
of the rifle team depends as there
are only five lettermen still left
from last year’s championship
team. Three of them will gradu-
ate this year. '

addition,

“If we could only get our
scores on the kneeling position
up an average of five to 10
points per man then we’d be
right back in the groove,” noted
LaSpada who will be graduating
at the end of this season and
would like to see the team win
a few matches before he and
fellow seniors Bill Crooks and
Sparky Yourick leave.

The loss was the Pitts fifth
in a row with all losses coming
in the second hag of the sea-
son, as the first half saw the
shooters close out 1970 with a
3-1 record. Unfortunately ‘the im-
proving shooters will get no
break this weekend as they face
Grove City on Friday. ”

Grove City is 7-3 but they
average about 30 points over
the Pitt shooter’s average of
1,240.

Spring Grid
Practice‘ In

Three Weeks,

. Because of the installation of
Astro-Turf at the Stadium, Coach
Carl DePasqua plans to start
spring practice for the 1971 foot-
ball team three weeks early.

March 8th will be the opening
of the off-season drills and they
will end on April 3rd with the
annual Blue-Gold game.

This will be the first time
that the intra-squad battle will
be played before the end of
the winter term. In years past,
the team had to stay on campus
after the semester break for the
game.

Another advantage of the earl-
ier starting time is that the grid-
ders will not have to be practic-
ing» during the winter term final
examinations.

“We’re able to hold this early

Spring practice because of the

turf,” said Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski. “We may be
affected somewhat by the cold
weather, but not like we would
be if we had to work in the
mud.”

DePasqua anticipates approxi-
mately 75 players to practice.
The number includes 22 letter-
men and 32 freshmen.

   

Captain Bill Crooks led riflers with 256.

Pitt’s Women Cagers
Conquer 00 Youngstown

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Bad weather and a hour—and-fivteen minute delay of Saturday’s
game could not deny Pitt’s women’s varsity basketball team their

first win of the season, as they crushed Youngstown, 59-29.

The coaches of both teams originally thought Saturday’s con- -
test would be close. “I was surprised Youngstown didn’t give us a
said Pitt’s coach, Sandra Bullman. “Youngstown was

harder time,

on a slump, and it was to our advantage.”

Pitt took the lead within the
opening minutes of the game-
on a basket by Elaine Kingas-
and never relinquished it.

In the first quarter, Pitt com-
pletely dominated the boards.
On the combined shooting of the
starters—Phyllis Wojciechowski,
Elaine Kingas, Tana Casciola,
Rose Smith, and Jan Klause—
Pitt racked up 15 points and
didn’t allow Youngstown to score
until there was 35 seconds left
in the quarter.

For the rest of the game, the
starters saw little action as
Coach gBullman cleardd the
bench. The two outstanding sub-
stitutes were Roni Fensterman
and Cathy Cassell. On several
occasions, Roni stole the ball
and took it all the way for Pitt
baskets. And Cathy contributed
10 points to the Pitt cause.

1 Coach Bullman related, “I’m
very pleased with the playing
of the secondtteam. They came
through pretty well. "

Top scorer for Pitt was Elaine
Kingas, bringing in 14 points.
In Pitt’s last game Elaine only
scored two points, but in the
Youngstown game she “had
more confidence. It was a re-
laxed game; there was no ten-
sion between the teams.” I

Phyllis Wojciechoski, groubled

by her foul shooting, still man-,

Pitt.

The Cubs made it six in a row
on Friday night as they bombed
the Point Park JV’s 97-70 at the
Field House. The victory upped
their season's record to 9-4 with
four games remaining on the
schedule.

Mickey Martin, the Fresh-
man’s hustling forward, led the
squad in scoring as he has done
all year with 27 points. Sam
Fleming hit for 15 while Jim
Bolla and Bill Swartzman both
had 12 points.

The 97 points racked up is
the highest point total for the

9 Cubs this year.

In addition to the shooting,
all-arpund hustle which caused
Youngstown to commit an unof-
ficial 24 turnovers, helped the
girl cagers to their first victory.
“The girls were really diving

was really good,” said Coach
Bullman.

“We were successful in our
offense, and our defense was
the best ever.

The Freshman Dental Stu-
dents, sporting a 4-1 record in
Intramural Basketball play, add-
ed another victory to their record
by beating the Educational
Researchers Thursday night in
Trees’ Hall Gym. The final
score was 47-41. 5

Throughout the first half, it

looked as if the Ed. Researchers,
with a 1-3 record were primed
for an upset. The lead changed

hands many times in the half. 

The widest gap in points was

‘ only four in the first period. The

inspired Researchers, led by scor-
ing ace Wingard, led by the slim
margin of 23-22 at halftime buzz-

er. The scoring was widely dis- 0

tributed among numerous play-
ers for both teams.

At halftime, Rod Fedo’rchak,J M,
captain of the Dents must have 7 

given his team an inspiring pep-
talk. They came out in the sec-
ond half as an extremely .in-
spired team. With two minutes
gone in the period, the Fresh-
man dents took the lead. From
that point on, they never fell
behind. Wagner, a Dent ace,
developed an extremely hot
hand. Having onlyvtwo points in
the first half, he poured in
twelve more in the finaliperiod‘.

The Dents defense was ex‘-
ceptionally tough, holding

goals the entire half. The rest
of the Searchers points came
on free throws.’

The high scorer in the game
was Wingard of the Researchers
with 18 points. 12 of them com-
ing on free throws. Wagner was
next with 14.
