Dean expects draft to
be complete by Friday

Cesca Antonelli

A draft of the budget proposal that may
include cutbacks to departments is set for
ﬁnal deliberations this week, and graduate
students are still concerned about the priori-
ties driving the process.

Peter Koehler, dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, said the report that he and
his advisory committee are writing will go
to the school’s Planning and Budget
Committee by the end of the week.

Organization spoke to the advisory comrnit—
tee last month to express their concerns
about the evaluation process. When the

G50: Programs are

Members of the FAS Graduate Student

  

committee then asked how the group would
like to see programs judged, the students
held a meeting and responded in writing.

In that response, dated Feb. 20, the p

GSO repeated arguments it has been mak-
ing for months: that the evaluation criteria

, have not been clear, that Pitt needs to reex-

amine its priorities, and that cutbacks in
some the targeted departments will weaken
already strong programs. '
C . .

‘There is’ both confusion and frustration
about the criteria being used» to assess
departments and graduate programs in
FAS,” the GSO said in the letter.

Dan Schoos, one of the GSO represen-
tatives who spoke with the advisory com-
mittee, expanded on the letter, saying that
departments didn’t know what to talk about

A with the committee because they did not

know how they were being judged.

“It’s very difficult for departments to
try to make a case of themselves when they
don’t know on what basis they’re being
judged,” Schoos said. ‘‘It favors an adrninis—
tiation who’s interested in chopping things
out. If they can keep the criteria secret, then
you make your case, and they say, ‘that’s
good for that, but you failed to show us X
and Y.”’

The GSO letter explained why the
placement of a program’s graduates in “rel-
evant” positions may not be a good criteria.

Koehler said previously that “a student
who obtains a Ph.D. should aspire to a pro-
fessional occupation that utilizes that train-
ing in some form.”

Members of the GSO argue that ofﬁ-
cials do not always know which jobs utilize
training.

CGS government debates viability of merger

Lisa Grzyboski

   
 

The College of General Studies
student government held a special
meeting last night to discuss a propos-
al for the possible dissolution of their
council.

Certain council members chal-
lenged the proposal that would dis-
solve the CGS student government and
replace it with a governance group
under the FAS Student Government
Board.

Council member Linda Messineo

expressed concern about the speed of
the proposal and advised the council to
slow down in order to best serve the
needs of the students in face of a
changing program.

Messineo stated that the concerns

were brought to the attention of Robert ‘

Carter, dean of CGS, and Robert
Gallagher, vice chancellor for student
affairs, two months ago. The CGS
council decided at that time to move at
a moderate pace.

Messineo said that she did not
understand the sudden decision by

binging, and bereavement

Scarlette Corbin

 

For manyostudents, drinking is a way

of life. Many students would rather think '

about quarter drafts, Absolut, and
Milwaukee’s Best — better known as
“The Beast” — than about alcohol’s nega-
tive effects.

Many students can relate a story of
getting drunk, getting sick, passing out, and
waking up feeling like they’ve been hit by
a Mack truck for the rest of the afternoon 
if they’re lucky.

Unforttmately, drinking is not always
that benign. —

A favorite 21st birthday pastime has’

led to several examples of tragedy: the
"let’s-have-a—shot-for-every-year" game,
more commonly known as the “2l-gim
salute.”

According to Student Health’s educa-
tion administrator, Shirley Haberman, this
is a dangerous practice which can result in
death

death. You’re setting yourself up for alco-
hol poisoning  [21 shots of alcohol] can
be a lethal amount,” Habelman said.
Some members of the Pitt community
may remember the Pitt student who died

“ln all likelihood, it could lead to

 

two years ago after attempting to drink 21
shots on the eve of his 21st birthday. He
ﬁnished l6 of them before passing out and
later dying of alcohol poisoning.

According to Nancy Schmidt, Student
Heath’s substance—abuse—prevention spe-
cialist, the reason why alcohol may be
deadly is because it is a form of depressant
which slows down the body’s breathing
and heart rates.

“If someone can’t speak, walk, or
make sense of anything, that’s a clear sign
of alcohol poisoning,” Schmidt said.

Not all forms of alcohol overuse have
consequences as frightening as death, but
many are severe enough for a trip to the
hospital.

“Unfortimately, nearly every weekend
we have cases of alcohol-related accidents
or overuse that end up in Presby ER
[Presbyterian Hospital emergency room],”
Haberman said.

But Haberman said there are telltale '

signs to watch out for that may stop an
evening of drinking from becoming" an
evening of tragedy.

According to Haberman, if individu-
als are unable to. stand, are only poorly
aware of their surroundings, have diﬁicul-

ty breathing or trouble speaking, are passed

Yeltsin seizes Clinton's condition
as crutch to criticize U. S. policy

Around the World

MOSCOW —— Russian President Boris
Yeltsin is talking tough days before his
meeting with President Clinton.

Appearing healthy and vigorous after
recent heart surgery, he suggested roles
were now reversed — with Clinton being
the one who is ill. Yeltsin was referring to
the president’s recent knee surgery.

Yeltsin says he opposes America’s so-
called “comman ” of the rest of the world
and will continue to ﬁght against NATO’s
expansion into Eastern Europe.

The Russian president made it clear
he does not want a return to a cold war
with the United States but that he expects
more compromise in the future.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu says he’s going to
continue with plans to build apartments in
East Jerusalem despite Palestinian anger.

Construction to build 6,500 apart-
ments for a Jewish neighborhood could
begin as early as this week. Officials warn
of violence and hospitals are preparing to
treat a large number of casualties.

Netanyahu says Israel is ready to deal
with any violence. ’

Across the Nation

NEW YORK — The annual St. Patrick’s

Day Parade in New York has taken a step
away from tradition.

At the stroke of noon, participants
recalled the 150th anniversary of Ireland’s
great famine by bringing the parade to a
complete halt for one minute of silence.

At a mass in St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Cardinal John O’Connor recalled the
famine and the 1.5 million people who
died. He said if people ignore history,
they’ll be condemned to relive it in one
way or another.

Before the parade, about 150 mem-
bers of the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization demonstrated on Fifth
Avenue to protest their exclusion from the
parade. Some three dozen people were
arrested.

DENVER —— Timothy McVeigh’s trial
will begin on time in Denver.

Federal Judge Richard Matsch has
rejected a defense request that the
Oklahoma City bombing suspect’s trial be
delayed or moved. Lawyers requested the
change, citing what they said were “incen-
diary” news stories that McVeigh had con-
fessed.

Matsch said his experience suggests
that the reports won’t have as much
impact as the defense thinks. He says he
believes a fair and impartial jury can be
chosen, and has ordered the process to
begin March 31.

Senate discusses

Bigelow, Board of Trustees

Melissa Blackwood
5‘  In  U W  :-  '1. .::§:¢s="' ’ «:-

 

The theme at yesterday’s Senate
Council meeting was compromise. '

The Council didn’t reach any compro-
mises of its own, instead the members
debated the merits of two recent compro-
mises: one by the City of Pittsburgh and
one by the Board of Trustees.

The city decided to keep Bigelow
Boulevard open, but narrow it and improve
the surrounding area. The Board of
Trustees voted to keep student, faculty, and
staff representatives on committees but
take away their right to vote.

Even as University ofﬁcials touted
both of these compromises as indications
of improved communication between
members of the University and the outside
community, student leaders complained
that their concerns were overlooked.

“How will we accommodate a more
congested traffic ﬂow, how will we com-
pensate for the loss of parking?” asked
Jennifer Molluso, head of SGB’s Bigelow
Boulevard Task Force. “And what about
the construction to narrow Bigelow? It’s
going to make getting to class harder, and
it’s going to create a lot of noise.”

Molluso proposed modifying the com-
promise to address these issues, but said
she is doubtful Pittsburgh City Council
President Jim Ferlo, an outspoken oppo-
nent of closing Bigelow Boulevard, will
agree.
“When I met with  Ferlo last week,

he gave me the impression no more studies —

are plarmed. He seemed to just want to put
the issue behind him,” she said. .
Ferlo was not available for comment.
John Stevens of the Graduate and

Professional Student Association echoed '

Molluso’s concerns over parking.

?‘When we endorsed the compromise,
it was with the understanding that there
would be accommodations for the loss of
handicapped parking on Bi gelow. We want
to make sure that happens,” Stevens said.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg adrnit—
ted the plan needs some work.

    

‘There are still several things to work
out in connection with this alternative
because it was not the focus of the studies
in the fall,” Nordenberg said. “But I think it
was a good resolution because it permits us
to begin working with the commimity in a
better light now.”

Keith McDuﬁie, president of Senate
Council, agreed. “It seems clear this is the
best we can do right now. But the agree-
ment does have the beneﬁt of showing Pitt
as willing to compromise with the commu-
nity,” he said. “I think in the past, some

have viewed us as rather heavy-handed in

our dealings with the community.”

However, SGB President Justin
DalMolin expressed doubts over whether
the Oakland community or City Council
‘members really care that Pitt compro-
rrrised.

“I don’t believe the community is sat-
isﬁed with the compromise because it’s
better, I think the community is just happy
that the University didn’t get what it want-
ed,” DalMolin said.

Students and faculty also offered dif-
fering opinions about the Board of
Trustees’ decision to continue student, fac-
ulty and staff representation on committees
but take away their right to vote.

“I was very pleased to see the Board of
,Trustees compromise, because they cer-
tainly did not have to,” said McDufﬁe. “All
along I’ve said the votes are not the impor-
tant thing; it’s communication that is. I
think it’s obvious the Board voted the way
they did because they heard our concerns.”

Many others, though, feel the new role
of students, faculty and staff on Board
committees is nothing more than ceremo-
nial. ,

“Isn’t that a major loss of power for us
to get our views across?” asked Stevens.

“I don’t think so,” McDuffie respond-
ed. ‘The Board can retire to executive ses-
sions without our input, but they carmot
take any action there. ,

“And if they begin to do it too often,
that’s something we will certainly be con-
cerned about. We deﬁnitely are going to
monitor the situation.”

Alcohol

out and will not wake up, or experience a
loss of bodily functions, medical attention
should be sought immediately.

According to Student Health officials,
excessive drinking is a problem that can
begin in high school, and seems to accelerate
during the ﬁrst few years of college. They do
stress, however, that not all examples of alco-
hol overuse and aloohol—related incidents are
linked to freshmen and sophomores.

“Generally, the first— and second-year
students are experiencing their first taste of
ﬁeedom. As students get older, some devel-
op a sense of responsibility,” Schmidt said.

 

FROM PAGE 1

But some see freedom as less of a cause
and more of a cure.

Brian Wales, a 22-year-old senior, said
that some freedom may actually be the cure
to alcohol overuse.

“My parents never kept me from drink-
ing. They always let me drink a little some-
thing when I was younger, so alcohol wasn’t
such a novelty for me,” Wales said.

No matter what alcohol—overuse-pre-
vention theory a student subscribes to,
school officials hope that students will prac-
tice educated, controlled, and responsible
drinking.

“What counts as a ‘good job’ for a
Ph.D. holder varies from ﬁeld to field and
may vary within a given ﬁeld over time,”
they said in the letter.

The GSO posed a criteria of its own,
including the number of applicants, cost-
effectiveness, National Research Council
rankings, quality of current students, and
reputation of faculty.

Schoos did not know if those criteria
were among those being used. “[The com-
mittee] did not reveal to us what their crite-
ria were,” he said. V

Koehler had previously detailed a
wide range of criteria being used in the
review that included all seven of those pro-
posed by the GSO and adding the success
rate of students —-—_if they complete the

 

degrees they came to Pitt to get.

The letter reiterated the GSO’s con-
cerns about University—wide priorities, say-
ing that the group would‘support,changes
which lead to improvements “which are
implemented with both a clear vision of the
future  and input from all affected par-
ties.” The GSO stressed the need to “reex-
amine spending priorities at a higher leve .”

The bnmt of the GSO criticism has
been born by the athletic department,

“In this time of financial constraint, is
it wise, even from a business standpoint, to
build a new basketball arena?” Schoos
asked. “Is it wise to be funnelling millions
of dollars towards a mediocre football pro-
gram? If we were losing money like they
were, I don’t think we’d be around very
long. The odd thing is that some depart-
ments are very cost-effective.”

Schoos, a classics student, used his
department as an example, calling it the
most cost-effective department. “You’d
think that if your model is a business one,

which operates on a $9 million budget. Of you wouldn’t touch that [but classics is cat-

that $9 million, $4.25 million pays the cost

President Erika Nanz and Vice
President Marjorie Carlson to draft
proposals, defying the prior agreement
made by council to move slowly.

“What happened to the need for
careful consideration?” asked
Messineo. “Why is this being pro-
posed during elections?”

Carlson responded by informing
all members present that the proposal
given to Gallagher was merely a
response to his request to look at
things and uncover other options.

“When we brought this to Dr.
Gallagher, he said that what we pro-
posed was very feasible,” said
Carlson. “If he had said no that is was-
n’t feasible, then we would have con-
sidered it a moot point. All we tried to
do was draft a proposal that was tangi-
ble to read so that we could discuss
this and have something to refer to.”

Carlson and Nanz said that they
decided to move quickly because of
expected budget constraints next term
and apparent student apathy. Only two

_ CGS students decided to run for coun-

cil' positions in the approaching elec-
tions. i
“We were going to wait for anoth-
er year before looking at other
options,” said Carlson. “However, we
were disturbed that only two people
were running for office and by the
enormity of our budget constraints.”
After emerging from a closed ses-
sion that bisected the meeting, the
CGS council set forth three resolutions
they decided to pursue in the coming
weeks. , 9
First, they said they want complete

control over the CGS budget and to

know how funds are being spent by
requesting the most recent account
statements for their programs. They
expect to have these statements by
March 19. .

They are requesting complete
records on CGS enrollment and pro.-
jected enrollment figures for 1998 in
order to determine what their budget
may be.

Lastly, they moved to appoint a
committee to research the future of
CGS and what constituency the coun—
oil will serve. They hope to focus more
on non-traditional students. 

The last resolution became a point
of contention among council members
because of the vagueness of the com'_‘»
mittee. Nanz responded by calling for
the specifics of the committee to be
discussed and clarified at a later date-

“This council is not used to deal—
ing with things of such magnitude,’.’
said Justin DalMolin, SGB president,
who was present at the meeting, “1
agree with [Messineo] that things must
be done in a step by step manner. We
have to be patient. Everyone has to
really alert the students as to what is
happening.” ,

Police and service employees as other caus-
es for concemi about how other priority
issues are being handled. Pitt Police have
been working without contracts since July
1994, and the service employees’ contracts
ran out in Dec. 1995. Negotiations are still
in the works.

Provost James Maher has said repeat-
edly that he does not want to interfere with
the FAS evaluation and planning process

and that his vision for the school includes a

5—percent reallocation of funds each year to
make it “the best school FAS can be.”

The GSO also expressed concemthat
some departments being targeted are strong.
‘The category four departments are

 

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 4

strong and viable,” Schoos said.
“Actually, four was never meant to be a
qualitative ranking, according to the
administration. Now, if they want to
change their tune  then they would have
to show, based on what criteria they ﬁnd,
these departments weak.”

In the 1995 Phase H process, depart-
ments placed in category four were “to be
reviewed” and moved into different cate-
gories. Only one, the Hispanic depart-
ment, was ever moved. According to the
report, category ﬁve, “to be reduced,”
was meant to be a qualitative ranking.

“During the Phase H process, certain
weaknesses were identiﬁed in those pro-
grams [in category f1ve],” Schoos said.

According to Schoos, another prob-

 

lem with the process is that programs
don’t seem to be rewarded for making
improvements that were recommended
by the report. Schoos said that the geolo-
gy department made changes and is still
in category ﬁve.

“They were praised by the deans for
their following through on recommenda-
tions made to them during the Phase H
process,” Schoos said. “They responded
in a very positive way, but it doesn’t seem
to have helped them  What are you sup-
posed to do? It doesn’t seem, based on
that example, any more proﬁtable for a
department to follow through on recom-
mendations than not to.”

Thomas Anderson, chair of the geol-
ogy department, is out of town this
month and could not be reached for com-
ment.

5

Koehler said that those changes will
be taken into account during the review.

“We reviewed departments both in A

category four and ﬁve, and they are going
to be reclassiﬁed,” he said. “That’s part
of this report.”

Geology has added an environmental
studies major for undergraduates, accord-
ing to Koehler, though he would not
comment on how the graduate depart-
ment would fare in the proceedings.

“Environmental studies is a big part
of what they’ve done,” Koehler said. “It’s
a very useful addition to our curriculum.

[The faculty] have also worked up a lot of 1

funding proposals for their own research;
they’ve worked very hard on that.”

Use your brain and don’t
be a slave to the bottle

It’s a fact: most college students drink alcohol. It is also
a cold, hard fact that many college students have drinking
problems. Even colder is the number of students who drink
themselves to death.

Two years ago, a Pitt student died of alcohol poisoning
after attempting to drink 21 shots in celebration of reaching
that milestone in a student’s life: legality.

It has become a rite of passage for students to have the
“2l-gun salute” of 21 shots on their 21st birthday. Not only
is this extremely dangerous, but it is also stupid.

It isn’t much smarter to drink yourself into oblivion
every weekend or every day.

It would be silly of us to tell you not to drink. It is not
illegal to drink if you are 21 years of age, nor is it unac-
ceptable by most standards. However, if you are going to
drink, drink smart.

Drink at your own pace. Your 300 pound buddy can
pound beers like there’s no tomorrow, and there probably
will be a tomorrow for him. You, in your not so highly
metabolic body, cannot. If you feel you’ve had enough,
stop. Your friends will think less of you if you are dead,
than if you know when to say “when.” If they don’t, they
weren’t really your friends to begin with, and perhaps you
should point them in the direction of AA. . .

There is nothing wrong with having the occasional beer.
However, if the occasional beer starts at noon, stops when
you pass out, and you wake with a major headache in the
morning, there is something wrong. ‘

If you’re going to drink, be smart about it. ,There’s noth-
ing cool about being an alcoholic or, even worse, dead. If
drinking becomes a problem, get help. No one should be
ashamed of getting help. Shame ‘comes to those who do not
get help. You don’t have to drink to be interesting and fun.
If it gets to be too much, get some new friends, and get a
life.

“God made you black for a
reason.”

I heard those words 17 years
ago, during my brief time at

Georgia Tech, from a lovely, white, ,

Agnes Scott College sophomore
and Miami native nicknamed
Lolly, dining a telephone conversa-
tion which had turned to race rela-
tions. (We attended the same white
Atlanta church.) ’

I Now, I realize that most peo-
ple would have considered that
comment an insult, suggesting .that
perhaps I was being told to “leam
my place.” But if anything, she
meant just the opposite — my fel-
low church members actually
knocked themselves out to make
me feel welcome. She was really
saying, “Because God created you
this way, I love and accept you as
you  She became a wonderful
source of encouragement to me.

I began thinking about Lolly
while considering the rise of
“Afmcentrism” and its emphasis
on so-called “self-love.” The con-
cept, in theory, is to give a positive
emphasis to black culture (e.g.
dress, music, and language) and to
combat a supposedly negative self-
image that many black children,
especially in urban ghettoes, have
foisted on them, courtesy of the
majority culture. For example,

some social scientists will tell you

the reason why gang violence
exists is because “they don’t know
their history.” Sounds nice, but it’s
a bunch of bunk.

The truth is, Afrocentrism as
such doesn’t really work. I should
know; I grew up with it.

During my childhood in the
late ‘60s and early ‘70s, my family
had whole bookshelves of materi-
als on black history. Learning

about such luminaries as the

chemist George Washington
Carver", NAACP founder W.E.B.
Du Bois; and Jean-Baptiste Pointe
du Sable, the founder of the city of
Chicago, became an integral part
of my extracurricular education. In
those days, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette ran a weekly colunm on
noted black achievers called “They
Had a Dream” which my father
clipped faithfully. I have a nearly
30-year-old copy of Eldridge
Cleaver’s “Soul on Ice.”

But did this cultural knowl-
edge leadto “self-love”? Not in my
family, it didn’t; if anything, I
detected an undercurrent of resent-
ment toward the white race, partic-
ularly from Dad. He used to refer
to expletives as ‘White language,”
and once I heard him respond
loudly to a TV music offer with
“It’s called white folks can’t
dance!” Furthermore, Dad was an
alcoholic whose father left my
father’s family when he was ﬁve.
My father never dealt with those
issues. He would take his anger out
on me, and I used to vent it in inap-
propriate places, such as school.

Then, most of the kids, espe-
cially the girls, in my neighbor-
hood rejected me, probably
because I wasn’t “black enough.” I
spoke proper English all the time,
took classical piano lessons,
brought home decent grades, and
didn’t hang out on the street comer
like most of them. (Admittedly, I
was a bit socially backward as
well.)

So how did I learn self-love?
Well, it started in the fifth grade
with a conversation I had at recess
with a popular blonde classmate
who said, out of the blue, that she
liked me. I was so excited that I
went around telling this to every-
one for the next three days. It con-
tinued with a very nurturing sixth-
grade teacher, also white, whom I
still call once in a while. One

ed made me black for a reason

morning, she had me, the only
black male, lead the class in devo-
tions and the Pledge of Allegiance
while she left the room. I had no
idea then why she did that.

I do now.

Anyway, the ultimate problem
with Afrocentrism is its focus on
itself and its alleged superiority (I
understand that at least one speak-
er refers to melanin as having
“mystical powers”), to the point
where it can relate to nothing else,
which is why its proponents have a
hard time frmctioning in society at
large. It doesn’t promote self-love
but rather self—obsession _ which
is the other side of the coin 0 “self-
hate.”

Love, on the other hand, nec-
essarily implies the give—and-take
of a relationship and actually tran-
scends culture. Real love means
you “do right” by the other person;
self-love, therefore, means doing
right by yourself and accepting
yourself for what you are: talents,
quirks, and limitations. It has noth-
ing to do with race, culture, or any
of that stuff. And you need to pass
it on.

I called Lolly, now a Tampa
wife and mother of three, a few
years ago and told her, “You
remember that remark you made
about God making me black for a
reason? Well, I think I know what
that reason is” — to deliver this
message. Her response? “Wo—o-
ow!”

I don’t mean to imply that
people shouldn’t know their histo-
ry, only that doing so is worthless if
it leads to arrogance. I remember
this quote from an anonymous
white South African university stu-
dent: “You must have your own
culture — and love the other one,
too.”

Rick Nowlin believes in himself --
and as a result, so do a lot of other
people.

 

 

Within the next few
years, the federal government will
soon be slapping a several hun-
dred dollar entertainment fee on
all of us who will ever want to
watch some television. At least,

that’s Clinton’s
scheme.

You see, there’s a new
broadcast format called “digital
television,” which is designed to
replace the old analog format on
which all of our current televi-
sions operate.

I But it won’t replace it in
the same way that computers
replaced typewriters.

For example, if you
could afford a computer, you
bought one, and otherwise, you
kept on using the old typewriter.

fancy new

Now, if you want to watch TV, -

you will be forced to buy a new,
expensive set which will accept
the digital format. Otherwise, you
will only get to watch snow on
your old tube. And expect to do
this within eight years — that’s
right, before you’ve paid off those
student loans which prevent you

Tuesday, March ‘I8, ‘I997

from entertaining yourself in any
way other than watching TV.

I know, I know; a lot of
people will retort that television is
a luxury and not a necessity, and
that we don’t have some divinely
given right to it, but the same goes
for electricity! Imagine that the
government came along and said,
“Sure, you can have electricity.
But we’re changing the voltage at
the plants so it won’t work with
any of your old equipment, and
you’ll have to buy all new stuff.”
That doesn’t sound quite so rea-
sonable, does it? So, tell me,
what’s the difference?

’ Clinton’s idea is to raise
some $15 billion to balance the
budget, but not by selling the TV
sets rather, by selling the tele-
vision channels. That is, the FCC
regulates the use of broadcast-fre-
quency charmels in this country,
and it will charge a television sta-
tion to let it use that new digital
channel. Charging corporate

America some extra bucks and ‘

trying to help balance the budget
is supposed to sound ﬁne to the
rest of us, but we are going to end
up paying, too.

. Now, we will not pay the

government directly. No, that
would be too obvious a way to tax
us. We’re supposed to buy these
TV sets from private industry and

to not think about all the money

that will make its "way back to the
government through taxes, which
is probably nothing compared to
what the lobbyists for these man-
ufacturers are offering our lead-
ers. .

In 1992, it was proposed
to spread this change over a peri-
od of some 15 years, by which
time, it was assumed, most people
would have switched over to the
new sets anyway. It is widely
acknowledged by most people in
the government that this is an
extremely over-optimistic
assumption. We only need to con-
sider how long it took most peo-
ple to change over to color televi-
sion when that product was intro-
duced.

So what about all the
people who really can’t afford to
shell out a few hundred dollars for
a new TV and who currently own
old models that only cost a few
cents a month for electricity and
are the only form of entertainment
that they can afford? Think about

some of our, 80-year-old widowed
grandmothers, living on an
already small ﬁxed-income pen-
sion and watching “Bob Barker”
and “Mama’s Family” reruns
each day on a 1959 black—and-
white Zenith, who can’t afford to
buy a new ﬂoral-‘print house
dress, let alone a digital TV!

This self—upsizing feder-
al government is becoming an
untouchablemaﬁa with little or
no regard for our happiness e as
long as it can keep enough of us
alive long enough to pay more
taxes and to upsize the govem-
ment a bit more. And the FCC is
becoming its newest “heavy.”

And who is this FCC
supposed to be, anyway? They
get to regulate the airwaves? They
get to own the airwaves? (“No,”

says the naive devil’s advocate. I

“They don’t actually own the air-
waves.” Well, how do they get to
auction off something if they
don’t own it?) Broadcast frequen-
cies are just the rates of oscillation
of electromagnetic waves (radio
waves). How does somebody get
to own a rate of change?

The FCC is an unelected
body of ofﬁcials who have

 

incredible power and who answer
to nobody. It controls what we are
“allowed” to see and hear. It gets
to decide what is right and what is
wrong. It makes our funniest
comedians tone down their acts.
The FCC is evil incarnate.

“Well, what would you
recommend?” asks the naive
devil’s advocate (I guess that
makes him the FCC’s advocate,
doesn’t it?). Personally, I’d advo-
cate anarchy, but I don’t think that
most people would want to go
along with that. Short of that, I say
that a few of these television sta-
tions should set up dishes just out-
side of the country, point them
directly at us, and continue to
entertain us and our grandmothers
as they did for so many years
without cable television: for free.

Of course, when this
happens, we can look forward to
buying the new TV setsanyway,
when they are made to comply
with the new standard electrical
voltage that doesn’t work with
our old stuff . Like I said: anarchy.

Kris Kissel hopes that the FCC '

knows better than to screw up the

-reception of his TV especially

during “ER. ”

CGS treats students like people, CAS treats them like cattle

 

For all of those people who think that
the CGS is a second—rate school, the CGS
student-govemment president and vice pres-
ident and The Pitt News have certainly
fueled the fire for stereotypes such as these
to continue.

But take it from someone who knows
and who is willing to‘ speak the truth (I was
the CGS student-government student—pro—
grarns director for the 1995-96 school year).
The CGS student government is adequately
serving the needs of CGS and non—tradition-
al students. The CGS student government
provides its students with a very informative
orientation, making new and continuing stu-
dents aware of the resources available to
them. CGS students have access to free pho-
tocopying and notary services as well as
other services provided by their student gov-
ernment. CGS students and council mem-
bers are also encouraged to represent CGS

4 by joining several University committees.

For many years (excluding this one,)
there has been a CGS Children’s Holiday
Party, which has given CGS students’ the
chance to bring their children to campus to
make Christmas crafts, meet Santa, and
receive gifts. There are also three armual
graduation dinners where, as in a traditional
graduation ceremony, students march in and
are announced one at a time to receive a cer-

tiﬁcate. This gives students the recognition
for their achievements that they would never
receive at the University’s enonnous gradu-
ation ceremonies. This is preceded by a very
elegant dinner with the student’s family and
friends. There are excellence-in-CGS cere-
monies which honor students who attain
high academic achievements. All of these
ceremonies, including the graduation dimer,
are held in the evening -- -------------- -«
so that CGS students
(the majority of whom
hold full—time jobs) are
able to attend them with
their families. The CGS
student-government
office is also open until
9:00 p.m., while most
CAS personnel are
heading for the parking
lot at 5.00 p.m.

In addition to these
armual events, we also
hosted an AIDS quilt
dedication on Sep. 13, 1995, honoring past
CGS students who had died of AIDS. Our
quilt was a project that was initiated by the
1994-95 Student Council and was hand-
made by some members of the CGS
Admissions Office staff. It was the first quilt
dedicated by the Pittsburgh chapter of the
AIDS Name Quilt Project. We also hosted a
very successful Toys for Tots drive in
December 1995. So, in addition to serving

  

the needs of the CGS and non—traditional
students, the CGS student govemment also
serves the community.

It takes a tremendous amount of time
and effort to attend school while working
full-time and raising a family (as do most
CGS students). The services offered by the
CAS are just not “adequate" to take care of
the special needs of CGS students.

As a student
who has transferred to
the CAS this year, I
believe that nothing in
the CAS is free except
for the Carnegie
Museum passes (which
CGS also gives to its
students), and I am
spending a small for-
tune to keep Pitt in the
Vend-a-Card business.
When the CAS can pro-
vide students with some
kind of personalized
attention instead of us being made to feel
like just another face in the ‘crowd, then
maybe that will be the time to discuss this
proposal.

So, I seriously question the motives of
Erika Nariz and Marjorie Carlson, and I
wonder what Justin DalMolin and the pow-
ers that be at this University hope to gain
from this. It is amazing that the president and
vice president of the CGS student govern-

ment (Narrz and Carlson) suddenly realized .

near the end of their terrris of office that they
are not serving the needs of CGS and non-
traditional students. What have they been
doing all year? Also, what right do outgoing
officers have to try to pass such a major deci-
sion at the end of the school year, thus affect-
ing the entire CGS student body, when nei-
ther of them is nmning for omoe next year?

It also angers me that The Pitt News
fails to report on any of the good things that
the CGS has done, while at the same time it
puts the fnst negative issue on the front
page. .

I urge all CGS students to let your pres-
ident and vice president know that this
change at the present time would not only be
foolish but an outright insult to the intelli-
gence of the CGS student body. I challenge
Justin DalMolin and his superiors to take a
closer look at what the CGS does for its stu-
dents before making such harsh judgments
based on an audit that was apparently draft-
ed with ill intentions. I plead with the
remaining three council members to ﬁght
for the rights of CGS students.

And because I was forced for academic
reasons to cross over to the dark side (the
CAS), this article and my undying support
for a very vital entity (the CGS student gov-
ernment) are the best things I can contribute.
Nena Ansari is a guest columnist for The Pitt
News who wishes that the CAS was as stu-
dent—friena'ly as the C GS.

What makes the opening rounds
of the NCAA Tournament the best
four days in all of sports was illus-
trated Friday night in Pittsburgh.

Coppin State, an unknown team
destined to be quickly forgotten in
NCAA tournament history and cer-
tainly, by all experts’ accounts,
fated to get‘ crushed in the first
round, reversed their predeter-
mined fortunes and beat second-
seeded South Carolina.

The win marked only the third
time that a l5th—seeded team

defeated a second—seeded team..

What was so impressive about
Coppin State’s win was that the
Eagles didn’t just squeak past
South Carolina, they won by 13
points.

In defeating a powerhouse,
Coppin made South Carolina look
like Cocks without any Game.

How dare Coppin State, a
school with an enrollment less than
4,000 students and winner of the
lowly MEAC conference, beat
South Carolina and step on the
SEC’s over-inflated shoes?

Welcome to the NCAA tourney,
baby.

Coppin State’s win is what
makes the tournament great. There
are no real givens in the tourna-
ment. All 64 teams are hungry to
prove that they belong in the tour-
nament and that they aren’t a fluke
team or undeserving of a seed.

Take the College of Charleston
for example. Shafted by the tourna-
ment selection committee with a
surprisingly low 12th-seed despite
a 20—game regular season winning
streak, Charleston showed they
were a solid team. Charleston

Pitt bows out of NIT with
76-71 loss to Arkansas

“Zachariah Blott

Pitt bowed out of the
NIT tournament last
night, coming up short,
76-71, at Arkansas.

Behind the great play
by guard Kareem Reid,
who registered 15 points
and 10 assists, Arkansas
weathered the 38 minute
see—saw battle before
pulling ahead at the two-
minute mark on a jumper
by Glendon Alexander.
That jumper put the
Razorbacks up 71-67, a
total that was too much
for the Panthers to over-
come.

Arkansas never led by

imore than seven, and Pitt

never by more than two,
throughout the contest.
Even with 23 seconds left
and Pitt down by four,
there was still a chance
for the Panthers. But
Arkansas hit their free
throws down the stretch,

 

ending the college careers
of Gerald Jordan, Jason
Maile, and Chad Varga.

Unfortunately for Pitt,
second—team all—Big East
player Vonteego
Cummings fouled out of
the contest with 33 sec-
onds left. Cummings’
offensive performance
was sub—par, scoring only
seven points and getting
charged with three offen-
sive fouls.

“We needed to make a-

play down the stretch,”
said Head Coach Ralph
Willard. “We never had
an opportunity to get back
ahead with [Vonteego
Cummings] out.”
Questionable calls
also helped Pitt lose only
their second of seven
close games during the
second half of the season.
Pitt was whistled for half
a dozen charges and sev-
eral other touch fouls. On

Pitt traveled to Muncie,
Indiana, this weekend and
came away with one of the
most frustrating losses a
team can experience. The
lady tumblers lost to the Ball
State Cardinals 190.55 to
190.375.

In an up—and—down
meet, the teams exchanged
the lead after each rotation.
The Lady Panthers led 47.95
to 47.325 after the vault due
to strong performances by
Lisa Fronhofer (9.8), Robyn
Senior (9.75), and Erika
Flamer (9.65).

Ball State took the lead
again after they outscored
Pitt 48.075 to 47 on the
uneven bars. Samantha

capture second place in the
event, and kept Pitt within
half a point of retaking the
lead, 95.4 to 94.95.

Pitt retook the lead on

the most unlikely apparatus
— the balance beam. Pitt
has had trouble with the
beam all year, but outscored
the Cardinals 47.45 to
46.975. It was a strong team
effort by all the Lady
Panthers on the beam as all
five gymnasts scored
between 9.4 and 9.525 to
take the lead by 142.4 to
142.375.

Pitt seemed ready to win

— the meet heading into their

strongest event, the floor
exercise. Saturday, however,
was not the day of the
Panther as Ball State
outscored the Pitt tumblers
48.175 to 47.975 to win the
meet. Lisa Fronhofer had the
top score for the Panthers
with a 9.775, but it wasn’t
enough to take the meet.

Allison Moore has returned from
shoulder surgery and is aching for
some rugby action. Literally.

Moore expected to play her first
game in over a year against Ithaca,
N.Y., the Angels’ first opponent.
Moore’s comeback was delayed due
to a cancellation, and the team was
forced to hold an intersquad scrim-
mage.

The senior ﬂanker said that she
did not have any problems with the
shoulder, but did feel some other

aches and pains after her long layoff. ,

“I wasn’t even thinking about
[the shoulder]. When I got home I
was kind of thinking about other
body parts, but that’s because it was

cold and muscles were tight,” she ,

said about the scrimmage.

The injury forced Moore to sit
out both the spring and fall seasons
of 1996, and after getting her first
taste of live action on Saturday, she
is especially eager for the Angels’
first game.

“After scrimmaging on Saturday,
I’m definitely ready to play. I’m
really looking forward to this week-
end at Clarion,” she said.

Moore is one of the most experi-

enced players on the team, having
played since her freshman year. Her
freshman year was also the same
year that she began having problems
with her shoulder.

She dislocated the shoulder on
what she termed an “improper tack-
le.” The problems continued over the
next season as well, with the shoul-
der repeatedly popping out of place.

Allison Moore has returned to the Angels after suffering a shoulder injury last year.

“The doctors originally wanted
to do arthroscopic surgery, but they
realized that it was so bad that they
had to open it up,” Moore said.

During her rehabilitation, Moore
struggled to lift even a one—pound
weight with the injured arm, but she
now lifts free weights regularly to
improve her rugby skills.

While she rehabilitated the

rugby. She only went to a few games
because she had trouble watching

the sideline.

“It was extremely difficult —
that’s why I tried to stay away,” she
said. 7

Upon her return to the Angels
she was named a team cocaptain.

“I was really happy with that,”

she said. “I was kind of surprised '

because a lot of the people were new

and had never played with me.

before.”

Moore’s position forces her to be
responsible both offensively and‘
defensively, which, according to
Coach Tim Nestor, is one of her best
attributes.

“Allison’s really good at both,”
Nestor said. “She’s very well—round—
ed.”

Moore realizes that she is bound
to be a bit rusty after such an extend-
ed period of time away from the
game. One of her goals for this sea-
son is to return to her pre-injury
level of play.

Now that Moore has returned,
she says that she plans to continue

BICYCLE LOCKERS FOR RENT

Pitt Ridesharing has made individual bicycle lockers available for
rent. The lockers are located on the Fifth Avenue patio of the
Towers, and outside of Forbes Quadrangle on the patio side. The
lockers are made of steel and totally enclose the bicycle. _ There is
also room for your helmet, riding shoes, etc. When you close the
door, the lock recesses into the handle, making the locker very safe
and secure, and keeping your bicycle protected from the elements.

       
     
        

Since we are into the spring term, the rental is $20.00 for the
remainder of the term plus a $10.00 key deposit which will be
refunded when you finish using the locker at the end of the term
and return the key.. The locker can also be renewed for the next
term. ‘

 
     
  
  

   

 
  

If you would like to rent a locker, return the coupon below to:
Ridesharing, Forbes Pavilion, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, or fax this page
