 At lVIock Jury Trials

tudents besieged a number of
arguments-on Feb. 20 in their
cases in Common Pleas Court.

The parade of witnesses, the exhibit A’s, and the cross-exam-

ination were all elements of
attorneys in competition for
of $1000.

The tournament is sponsoredby
the Academy of Trial Lawyers of
Western Pennsylvania to oﬁer ex-
perience 'to law students. Mem-
bers of the Academy have been
coaching the contestants. The
prize was named for Chief Judge
Gourley of Federal District Court
in recognition of his aid to the
organization. '

The Feb. 20 round featured
second» and third-year students
as the attorneys, Mt. Mercy stu-
dents and University _freshman
law students at witnesses, le-
gal secretaries of the Pittsburgh
area as jurors, and practicing
attorneys as Judges. The wit-
nesses in each case had been
shown different movies of the
same accident on which to base
their testimonies.

The later rounds of the tour-
nament will feature two Univer-
sity law students in play-offs
against two students of Duquesne
University’s law school. A ﬁnal
round, is scheduled for April 15

Cathedral,   Schenley Plaza
Focal Points of Traffic Plan

By BARRY GROSS

A proposal to install parking meters in the Schenley
Parking Plaza and alongside the Cathedral on Bigelow Boule-

vard-and Belleﬁeld Avenue will soon be considered by City ‘

Council, according to John Katsur, executive director of the
Oakland Chamber of Commerce. .
Katsur, owner of six parking lots in Oakland, attended a

$iueeting. early last week as an ob-

Ruth Maquire stated, “I am be

running mainly because I think I
am qualiﬁed. I have been in ‘the
Student Government O
ﬁrst. trimester of my freshman
year.’_f Miss Maguire desires better
communication between the sen-
atorsand students. She also stated
that the trimester system hasibeen
used too long as a scapegoat for
the lack of enthusiasm of Univer-
sity students. ' 1
School Spirit Exists

She also stated that some school
spirit still exists, ‘ and something
should be done to encourage more
school spirit by the students.
Equal participation in University
affairs by students should be
strived for according to Miss Ma-
guire. She believes more activities
should be slated to get the ad-
ministration, faculty, and students
together. ’

Miss’ Maguire is currently so-
cial chairman of AWS, chair-
man of this year’s Pitt Pre-
view, and a member of the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.

Carroll Smith is running on the

Able-Party slate. Miss Smith

much of ‘Pittsburgh will depend
upon the University for its lively-

hood. She states, therefore, that‘

the current antagonism of the
Oakland area toward the Univer-
sity should be soothed. However,
she stated that the students’ needs
should be the primary concern of
the Student Government.

Communication Problem
Miss Smith _agrees that the’ ma-
jor problem confronting SG is the
lack of communication with the
students. The discrimination prob-
lem in the Oakland area, Miss
Smith said, should be acted upon
by the" Student Government.
“I 'don’t think . a student
should be elected "simply on

These included: Woodrow , W.

tain Charles Ray, of the Univer-
sity Security rDepartment; and
Pete Bijur, chairman of the Stu-
dent Government Parking Com-
mittee.
- Meters in the center of " the
Plaza will allow four hours of
parking, while those alongside
the Cathedral will permit two

“The ‘day of free parking will O

“Streets will ﬁrst be used fo

He said that an extensive city
trafﬁc study revealed_that enough’.

paid parking facilities are avail- ' T

able for those wishing to park all
day in Oakland. He_feels that the

Plaza and Cathedral spaces should i-

be reserved _for visitors to that
immediate area.
‘Traﬁic Generators’

~Katsur explained that “traffic
generator” had to be considered
in studying the Oakland parking
problem, and deﬁned a, traffic gen-
erator as a place where special

events occur. Examples would be ’
programs at the Syria Mosque or:
lunchtime at the Pittsburgh Ath-

letic Association.

Installation. of the meters
would increase m’eter facilities
three-and-a-half times, Katsur
estimated.

‘If given a fair trial, the plan
will be liked by students,” he said.
“Fifty. percent of the parking
problem comes from people who

drive into Oakland in groups or c’

three cars, park two of them
free, and ride into, town in. the
third, having to pay only_ one
parking fee.” ’
New Dorm Not Helpful
He cited the new dormitories

as not helpful to the parking

problem, calling their location

“the ’ biggest mistake Litchﬁeld A

made: three dorms in an over-'

‘ crowded area, with no additional.

parking, creating a problem.”_
Executive director of’ the.
' Oakland Chamber of Commerce
for six years, Katsur was a sec-
retary in city traﬂic planning _
during an earlier study of the
Oakland area. The study re--
sulted in the painting of lines
in the Plaza, where cars previ-
ously had been parked bumper
to bumper, blocking _some peo-

Landy Is Man
Of F astAction

By NANCY FUCHS

“No sooner said than done
——so acts your man of worth.”
(Ennius) And so acts Marty
Landy, a junior, majoring in

‘ political science and running

for Student Government
Landy, a native of Pittsburgh, is
concerned with “getting things
done quickly.” His activities in
and out of SG mirror this con-
cern.

“The activity that means the
most to me is SG,” Landy ex-
plained.

Formulated LA Cabinet

Of the Liberal Arts Cabinet
formally instituted this month,
Landy said, “Judy Diethorn, SG
vice—president, and I formulated
the structure and discussed‘ it
with Dean Albert Martin, Dean
of the School of Liberal Arts, and
the other senators. The cabinet
will increase and insure under-

‘ standing between students within

the School of Liberal Arts and
the administration.”

Landy proposed and helped
organize the International Stu-
dents Service Committee be-
cause “there is such a large
number of foreignstudents at
the University that this commit-
tee is necessary to acquaint
American students with these

facts and assure their help to

It make the foreign students’ ad-

justment to American life

' V easier,” Landy explained-.

Landy also proposed‘ the SG
Award in the belief that “there
ought to be tomewhere outside
class where students who are
creative and have achieved ex-
cellence can be rewarded.” Work-
ing with Dr. Alan Rankin assistant
chancellor of Student and General
Affairs, ‘he organized a faculty
committee to judge the award
competition.

Winter Carnival

Landy is especially enthusiastic
about the Winter Carnival which
he helped to pass “For the entire
University there are very few
large dances. If the price is kept
at a minimum, it would cost less
than going to the movies,_” he
reasoned.

Landy’s concern with the dis-
crimination in renting in the
Oakland area led to his chair-
manship of the Human Rela-
tions, committee. He has just
recently began to work with
Dean William Crafts, Dean of
Men, to solve the problem.

“I am especially concerned
with making SG even more in
tune with student demands and
needs. I’ve been thinking up lines
of communication between SG
and students. I would like to let
students know with whom they
can get in touch to present any
complaints they might have,”
Landy explained. .

Work With E and M
“SG might also be able to work

more closely with Engineering
and Mines Cabinet in an effort to
make all schools actively aware of
what SG is doing,” Landy sug-
gested.
“I’m terribily concerned with
a vigorous SG. I like to get
things done quickly. That’s
how I’ve tried to work in the
past and how I hope to con-

tinue,” he added. .

Landy founded the Pitt Political
Forum, in which the students
from various political groups de-
bate and discuss political and so-
cial issues. He is now the chair-
man. As well as being a debator
for the William Pitt Debating
Union, he had helped with the
Student Union Board Forum
Series in the past, and now serves
on the Midday Series Commit-
tee.

Honorary Frat Member

Landy is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma and Druids, honorary fra-
ternities. He is presently working
on a psychology research project
with Dr. Roy Heath, head of the
University Counseling Service.

As a recipient of a fellowship
from Woodrow Wilson School of
Princeton University, he will
spend the summer, in Europe, do-
ing research on “The Inﬂuence of
the United States on Germany’s
Decision to Re-arm.” His fellow-
ship is one of 17 offered to stu-
dents of ten American colleges
and universities through funds
supplied by the Carnegie Foun-
dation.

Back SG---Bijur

By KA'I‘HIE.'EDWA_RDS_

Peter Bijur, the indepen-
dent candidate for SG presi-
dent, is earnestly campaign-
ing for that oﬁice like a true
politician. He has ﬁrmly
stated his platform and is
presenting his past record for
examination.

According to'Bijur, a native of
Mamaroneck, N. Y., communica-
tion and representation, are his
main points. “I plan to try every
means possible to get the student

body behind SG. That’s the real
key to a strong organization; re-

. liable student support.

Administration Support
“The support and conﬁdence of
the administration, -which SG has
received this year to an unques-
tionable degree, is only a begin-
ning,” he continues. “SG now
holds the finest position it has
held for two or three years, and I
hope ‘to carry it forward and im-

prove it as much as possible.

“This can only be done by

ties are those which will beneﬁt
the student body as a whole, not
just certain groups. He also feels

that his employment over the last--

few summers has given him a bet-
ter_background for assuming the
SG presidency.
Nationwide Tour
“Last summer, another ‘Univer-

 

Wall Street for a stock broker-
age ﬁrm, and the next summer
he worked in a clothing store.
“In these jobs, I’ve gotten to
meet many types-of people and
have learned to deal with just
about any situation. I think
they’ve .all helped to prepare
me for the responsibilities
would be entrusted with as SG,?
President.”

Bijur is majoring in political
science and plans to enter. the field
‘of international retailing, prob-
ably as a department store -man-
ager, after graduation. Right now,
he is interested in working for a
stronger and more representative
student government body. “I
think we can bring the entire
student body into SG activities if

we try hard enough, for every ,

student will have a potential con-
tact with SG if I am elected,” he
concluded.

Foreign students at the Univer-
sity met last Saturday in the Sup-
per room of SU to approve the
constitution for the Foreign Stu-
dent 'Association, University- of

Pittsburgh and_ to elect a seven.

member executive committee for
the association.

Dr. Shepard L. Whitman, Di-
rector of the‘ Office of Cultural
and_ Educational Exchange, and
Miss Renee Lichtenstein, the for-

eign student Ladvisor attended the “

meeting.
Danger Shown
_Speaking to the foreign stu-
dents, Dr. Whitman pointed out
the dangers of such an association
which could isolate the foreign
students from the rest of the col-
lege community. 7
“Any organization in order to
function at the University must
have an official -sponsorship,”
he said. “In your case it will be
my office. I have already talked_
to your leaders and I would ask
them to see me again after you
people have approved the con-
stitution. ~
“After that my office will re-
view ,the constitution and if we
feel that a good framework has
been set up then the office will
sponsor’ the association,” Dr.
Whitman then‘ proceeded to sug-
gest changes in .wording and
"minor matters of the constitution
as proposed. Most of these changes
were brought to the floor after his
departure and somegwere defeat-
ed. '
A Argued Point by Point
The constitution was argued
point by point for nearly two
hours and was adopted with some
changes. Then as provided in the

constitution the members present-

proceeded to elect t_he executive
committee. _
The provisional executive com-
mittee with one exception was
elected to serve the full term. Ma-
hmoud Ismail of United Arab Re-
public could not be elected to the
committee due to a stipulation in
the constitution that no more“than
two members of the executive
committee shall be from the same
continent. Vijay Jain from India
(Asia) was elected to the vacant
seat on the committee.
Mohammed Aramany. United,
Arab Republic (Africa), Morry
Traore, Guinea (Africa), Paul
Chen-Young, Jaimaica (South
America), Helen Paz-Garcia,
Columbia (S o u t 11 America),
S o mso ng Limsong, Thailand
(Asia) and Bosko Postic, Yugo-
slavia (Europe) retained their
seats on the executive council.
The constitution provides that
the executive committee will elect
ipso
facto become the officers of the
association. The officers will be
elected. at the ‘next executive
committee meeting on March 9.
Recognize Service Committee
4 Paul Ch‘en—Young, speaking for
the exec_utive'committee, said “We
recognize the existence of a for-
eign , student
formed by the Student Govern-
ment. We do not wish to be in
competition with them /and may
very well cooperate with them in
certain activities.”"The policy of

service committee.

the association regarding the SG

committee will be worked out and‘

clariﬁed to the members at the
next general meeting of the asso-
ciation.

Membership in the association
is open to all foreign students,
visiting scholars and academic
staff of the‘University. American

students. at the University and

other institutions as well as the
foreign students at other institu-

tions may join as associate mem- _

bers.

Coed Opinion Poll

The University branch of the
YWCA is .conducting a poll of
“college girls’ opinions and fears
about their present and/future
lives” for the national YWCA,
according to Mrs. Waldine Viv-
rett, executive, director. The poll
will run ‘March 4 through '7.

The YWCA'wi_ll use the data
derived from _this poll to .plan a
fall program “more suited to the
girls’ interests.” The VYWCA will
also make the results available
to the national office and any
other interested women’s organi-
zation on campus. ’

The Dorm Council is in charge
of distributing the questionnaires
in the girls’ dorms. Other 7women
can pick them upon the 12th
ﬂoor CL, in the nurses residence
or in 421 SU, the YWCA ofﬁce.

Both the dean of women’s of-
ﬁce and the Dorm Council sup-
port this project. Miss Helen
Poole Rush, Dean of students,
stated, “In order to make the re-

sults of the poll meaningful, all

the girls should participate, and,
if possibe, they shoud allﬁll out
the questionnaires on. election
day.”.

The answers should be as hon-
est as possible, according to Mrs.‘
Vivrett. The girl’s signatures are
not required on the ‘ question-
naires.

Generation of Traffic  

 

Oakland has a parking problem. ,

The main reason that there are more cars than parking
places in this area is that Oakland is replete with “traffic
generators,” to borrow a phrase from the executive director
of the Oakland Chamber of Commerce.

These traffic generators, however, are what make the
Civic Center really civic: Carnegie Institute, Syria Mosque,

Memorial Hall, the Pennsylvania Athletic Association, A
V Forbes Field, Pitt Stadium and, of course, the University.

And since t.hese landmarks and others will "continue to
generate an ever-growing flow of traiﬁc in Oakland, every-
one has been in agreement for a long while that something
must be done about parking. 1 .

Something is in the works, however. City Council will
soon officially consider a plan for the installation of two-
and four-hour parking meters in Schenley Plaza and on the

» streets ‘ﬂanking the Cathedral. The rationale behind this

move is two-fold; ﬁrst-, the strictly-enforced limited time
spaces will discourage“ the many bothersome suburbanites
who now drive into Oakland, park for free and travel down-
town by other means to avoid-paying the Triangle’s -ex_horbi—
tant parking rates. Second, the metered plaza, devoid of
all-day parkers, will induce shoppers to visit the area, an
idea which delightslocal merchants. _

There is only one hitchin the plan: where can students
and University personnel,.who generally spend most of the
day here, park their cars? '

Commuting students, resident, faculty members and
administrators will have no choice but to resort to parking
lots. They naturally will rebel at this added expense, and
understandably so. As members of the University, the
largest traffic generator in the Civic Center complex, stu-
dents and faculty members havebeen given no considera-
tion in this matter. ‘

It has been argued that the day of free parking is almost
gone forever. But there is noreason to encourage its de-
parture. A method of dealing with the problem other than
the unpopular parking meters is to determine a method of
discriminating between legitimate parkers — such as Uni-
versity people —- and the free-loading suburbanites Wh(
have no real business in Oakland. This could possibly be
done by a system of placing identiﬁcation markers on cars
that belong here, as is done in other colleges. This idea,
and other aspects of the Oakland parking situation will be
discussed in future editorials in this space.

Rational and Purposeful . . .

Art inMan's Life

Recently, we received in our offices a contri-
bution to Mosaic which occasioned a good deal of
discussion ‘among members of the editorial board.
Brieﬂy, it was an essay attack_on art, the artist and
the ‘art appreciator. Oddly ‘
enough, the piece was done with
an attempt at artistic style, but
the author’s main point was
that art is a meaningless thing,
executed by idiots for consump-
tion by other idiots.

‘ Unfortunately,-the author of
that essay exhibited a sliver-
wide mind, both in his View of
art and in the support which he
brought to that view‘. Art is a
rationally and purposefully ‘con-
ceived thing, based upon the artist’s desire to con-
vey an impression to other beings and,ﬁnding its

 

effect in an appeal both to thereason and the

senses. The extent to .which‘Ia painting, apiece of
sculpture, a building or even a _seven-layer cake
can be considered art depends’ not upon any one
of these conditions, but upon how well tall-‘of the
conditions are combined. ' . .
Art has played apart in man’s life‘ ever since
he ﬁrstlearnedgto observe. The Verudetlcer-forms
on "a cave wall in southern France might at "first
glance appear” to be the scr-awlings of a naive ‘dab-
‘bler, but they are, reflective of -a }consciously‘felt
desire to control the forces of naturefso that the
necessities of life might be more easily obtained.
The ‘ experiences_ of hardship must have ‘caused
early man to wonder what made antelope plenti-
ful one season and scarce the next, and, in won-
dering, search for a way to make his "source of
"food abundant at all times. His ignorance, of course,
made him prey toa religion ofsuperstition, and he
thought that by capturing the image of‘ the masto-
don he could capture the spirit of the animal itself;

"Room for Expression

Milleniums after primitive he first made cave-
wall murals from the crude ochre and red pigments,
man still ﬁnds room for the exip'ression.of his
needs, desires and emotions in art. Historic man,
however, haslearned to distinguish between fiction‘
"and reality, imitation and actuality; but his desire
to satisfy and express his basic drives is the same.

‘ The expression of modern needs in art,‘ though,“'is

the expression. of spiritual or intangible needs
rather than materialior metabolic needs.»I_f satis-
faction or expression of these ” intangible needs
were denied, mansmachinery: would break down,
just as if he-’,‘were denied food for a prolonged
period — with the same anguish," but more slowly.

But why in art? Why does man bare hissome-I
times ugly soul in a beautiful and artistic form? Be-
cause if he could not reveal himself and vent his
t"rust'ratiops in a beautiful yvay, he would do it in
an uglyand embarrassing way, and man often fears"

embarrassment more than death. It is true that '

Somebody Help Me Find . . .

  The Missing, Cgurse  

I wish someone would help me; I have‘ a little
problem. Since last week I’ve been looking for
something. But I can’t'ﬁnd it. It’s called a course.
One of the things that’s supposed’ to be offered
‘were three times a year.

You see, it all started this
Jay. I was grownup and al-
most a high school graduate, and
I was looking for somewhere to
.-pend the next four years. Some-

versity of Pittsburgh and the
next four years will -only take-
three. Being not~quite a high
school graduate (although quite,
grown-up) I took the advice,
and now’ I’m here.

I'm happy, too. Really I am. It’s
lost this course.

Cathedral March .

I marched over to the Cathedral the day class
schedules came out, contemplating a summer of
work. I looked in the schedule and found a class I
wanted at nine o’clock. I looked again and found
one at ten. Once more. and I found one at.eleven.
Nine, ten, eleven. That’s three’ hours. Three times
three" is nine. Twelve minus nine is three. I want
to be a full-time student. _

I lowered_ my standards and looked , again. "I V

refuge‘ in a_rt has not pr/oven sufficient for many
men. F‘. Scott ‘Fitzgerald, for instance, died‘ ‘for a
heart attack complicated by pleurisy contracted
while he lay alcoholieally comatose in‘ a Hollywood

— gutter. But ‘tin; is not to say that satisfaction

through art i‘s'an“il1usion."‘If John Donne had not

developed a facilityiwith tongue and pen, he might,,,~____
very well, inhlight of his"ha1‘dship, have turned to}
the flask. '
Yet perhaps there is a greater reason why art
.has such a prominent place in man’s life. Man can A

create‘, shall we say, out of the context of living.
He, unlike the beaver who will create a dam out
of instinct, can and does create just for the sake
of creating. And accompanying this desire to create
is a feeling of pride in his own creations and respect
for the creations of other men. And so men will
cherish meaningful experiences just for the chances
that these experiences will afford to "express them
in photographs or bronze. ' - '

It has been said that every meaningful experi-
ence of mankind has been expressed in some art
form. The answer to questions concerning the ap-

preciator, therefore, is rather obvious: knowledge. .

As long as‘ men try to‘ conveyvtheir observations,
frustrations and experiences in art, other men will
try-to draw out th"ese'elements, to discover the ‘un-
known facts about both the artists and themselves.

  LETTERS To THE

EDITOR



SU Forum Chairman

Blasts ‘News’ Report \

Editor, The Pitt News: ,
It is rather discouraging to

discover two abominable facts

about The Pitt News reporting

staff: .

First, that at least one_ of your

reporters has not the ability to

‘count past three;

Second,that this same report-
er cannot distinguish between
objective reporting and subjec-

' tive editorializing.

1:

During the second term of my
freshman year I worked for The
Pitt Newsias a reporter, and I
was taught to distinguish be-
tween the two. Perhaps the dif-
ference is no longer considered
important. s

As chairman of the Student
Union Forum Series, I have
worked all year to put on a
programgthat, conformed to rea-
sonably high standards and at
the same time would appeal to
a fairly large number of stu-
dents. ’

My -committee and I agree

‘that we -might be‘ approaching

our ideal with our last program
—— “Intellectual Apathy at Pitt.”

Certainly, the reporter ‘who
covered this panel discussion
was entitled to her opinion that
this program was neither fruit-
ful nor successful. A line should

~be drawn, however, between her,

opinion and her distortion of
facts to conform to this opinion.
Miss Bernstein does not seem
to realize the difference.

Her opening statement read:
“Three people out of appro‘xi-.
mately 250 responded favorably
to the query, ‘Did you feel that

‘ SUB panel

this discussion was worth-
while?’ ’.’ But does Miss Bern-

stein add t_hat“there was a great -

deal of confusion over the na-

ture of the question,‘and that
when Dr. Heath reph_r_ased the
question ‘to state, “How many
of you feel that you got‘some-
thing out of this discussion‘?”,
more than half — a modest es-

timate —- put up their hands‘?

Certainly "not! .

May I suggest that in the fu-
ture s u c h opinion - dominated
“news-columns” be restricted to
the editorial page, or at least
to Mosaics‘? ' A

Question of Criticism
Lostin Apathy Talk»

Editor, The Pitt News:

At least one member of the
on “Intellectual
Apathy at Pitt” brought to that
discussion a question: “Why do

‘students, for fear of the future

consequences to their careers

-and the like, fail to speak out,
"to criticize, to espouse a position

- which is unfavorable to others?”

Unhappily so, this question
was lost in the ensuing discus-

sion as'Dr.v Rothkrug attempted "

topresent his ideas in. language
which even the special assistant
to the Chancellor should have
understood. ,

Thus, Dr. Rothkrug’s contri-
bution to the discussion, as re-
ported in The‘ Pitt News on
Wednesday, mainly consisted of
a “call for a beer hall.”

It doesn’t’ take much insight
to recognize that Dr. Rothkrug

very obvious
void which’ exists at Pitt,” the
failure of groups and- indivi-
duals to generate a community
atmosphere in which discussion,
criticism, and the confrontation
of ideas is prominent in the
daily life of that “university
community.” '
The act of articulating an
idea,»of formulating one’s own
relationship to an idea, or a so-
cial ‘philosophy, in confronting

another is a learning experience"

in itself.

This would seem to be partic-
ularly true when one seeks out
another whose ideas are very
much different from one’s own

(when, indeed, such a creature,

is sought out!).

The school spirit has improved
tremendously the last few years

Penn State on Saturday.

I will be the ﬁrst_to admit
that the students have a right
to be upset about the 1962 foot-
ball team. There is no doubt in
anybody.’s mind that the record
should have been ‘better than
5-5. When the season began, the
team had the entire student body

and depressing _i

behind it. Everybody was opti-
mistic. We let you down.

In basketball it was different,
although the home schedule was
not exactly devised by N_ed Irish.

Nevertheless, ytou supported
the team and, in my opinion,

this helped iis have a good sea— _

son.

Everybody in our department,
especially Athletic Director

SG /Senator Questions

Able Party's Purpose

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a Senator for the past two
years, I question the purpose of
the Able Party. Party politics
often turn into machine politics,

with personalities becoming - »
more important than individual , -

accomplishments. .
Mr. Landy states in this Mon-
day’s Pitt News that he would

not permit any politicking by the

party following the elections.

If this is the case, then the
only purpose
party is to permit a group of

students, some who are qualiﬁed ‘

and some who are not, to band
together to push themselves for
election.

I hope that every student will V

exercise his privilege to examine
the past record of each candi-

date for every elected position "

and then vote rationally on the

basis of a sound understandings
of the persons running and not’

on the basis of party politics.

MANNING THE SWITCHBOARD that handles 3,500 to 4,060 calls

daily are, Ann Lougbrey, Chief

Operator; Florence French, and

Arwilda Riley. The switch board operators handle all the exten-
sion calls, 15 incoming lines, and 20 unlisted lines.

By MARCIA BERNSTEINM
Hundreds of students calling

each time 'it snows to ﬁnd out _

‘whether or not there is school is '
a major complaint of the Univer- .v

sity operators-
But telling students that there
is always school is‘ not the only

job of these ﬁve Bell Telephone’

Company-trained women.‘ iThey
take" care of all .the incoming and
outgoing calls on the University
switchboard, an‘ ediﬁce-like struc-
‘ture containing outlets for 1,500
extensions, 15« incoming ‘lines, and
20 unlisted lines for outgoing and
long-distance calls.
’ Foreign Calls . a
3,500 to 4,000 calls that
.10 in and out of the University in
an eight hour day, a large number
of these are to and‘ from Asia,
Europe, — and Africa. This is be-
causeof the large number of for-
eign students at the University.
“When these people’ first
came,” commented Mrs. Ann
Loughrey, chief operator, “and
we had the calls from all their
countries, it was surprisingand
sort of a thrill.” She went on to
say -that now “we’re used to
placing calls to practically every-
place in the ‘ world, so nothing
surprises us.” _ _ _

“The thrill comes in when we
complete the call,” Mrs. Loughrey
said; “You feel as though you
have ‘done a good job. It is im-
portant to the person placing the
call that they‘ reach their person.
There might A be. a, one, two, or
three hour delay, but even the
gliﬁerence in time doesn’t matter
100 much.”

Accents No Trouble.

The operators do not ﬁnd lan- .

_.'guage or accents a problem when
handling these calls. They say that

they can always make out what a
student wants, ' eventually.

Not all of the calls, ‘however,
. are to’ or from far-off, ‘exotic’
‘places. Some come from no
farther" away than the dormi-
tories. Anytime a person gets
‘stuck in an elevator, all he has
to do is pick up the phone that’s
stranded with him and a Uni-
versity» operator will be glad, to
call the “gentleman in, Schenley

.who is in charge of the tele-
vators.” ’

-While working two-,. sets of
trunks at once, Mrs. Loughrey‘ob-C
served that operators “really have
to be fast.” But the operators
don’t keep their skills to them-
selves. They personally" train the
students that work the board at
night and on the weekends.

But_ even though the board is
busy and the operators are con-
tinually working,_they enjoy their
W0I‘k. Mrs. Loughreyi in particu-
lar. “After 45 years,” she queried,
“what would you think?” 7

GLAD RAGS

The hounds of spring are on winter’s traces. Soon buds the

erocus, soon trills the giant condor, soon come the new spring

fashions to adorn our lissome limbs.

‘And what will the American college student wear this spring?‘

Gather round, you rascals, and light a Marlboro Cigarette and

enjoy that ﬁne mellow tobacco, that pure white ﬁlter, and

possess your souls in sweet content, and listen. _
As everyone knows, campus fashions have always been casual.

This spring, however, they have gone beyond being merely -

- casual: they have become makeshift.
The object is to look madly improvised, gaily spur-of—the-
moment! For example, why don’t you girls try wearing a.
peasant skirt with a dinner jacket? Or matador pants with a
bridal veil.? Or Bermuda shorts with bronze breastplates? Be
rakish! Be impromptu! Be devil-take-the-hindmost!
And, men, you be the same..Try an opera cape with sweat
pants. Or a letter-sweater with kilts. Or a strait jacketiwith
'p boots. Be bold! Be daring! Be a tourist attraction!

l ..
71: - ,-.-,

if W/2.’/12.» in mzpfzz,/

But all is not innovation in college fashions this spring. In
fact, one of the highlights of the season turns time backward in
its ﬂight. I refer, of course, to the comeback of the powdered
wig. .

This charming accoutrement, too long neglected, has already
caught" on with in undergrads everywhere. On hundreds of
campuses the bossa nova is giving way to the minuct, and
patriotic undergraduates are dumping British tea into the
nearest harbor. This, as you may imagine, does not sit well with
King George III who, according to reliable reports, has been
stamping his foot and uttering curses not fit to reproduce in
this family newspaper. For that matter, a lot of our own people
are steamed up too, and there has even been_somc talkabout the

‘erican colonies declaring their independence of England.
But I hardly think it will come to that. I mean, how can we
break with the mother country when we are dependent on her
for so many things—linsey-woolsey, Minié balls, taper snuffers,
and like that? She, on the other hand, relies on us for turkeys,
Marlboro Cigarettes, and Route 66. So I say, if Molly Pitcher

‘ and those other Radcliffe hotheads will calm down, and if

gentlemen will cry “Peace! Peace!” we may yet ﬁnd an
amicable solution to our differences. But let not our British
cousins mistake this willingness to negotiate for weakness. If
ﬁght we must, then ﬁght we will! Paul Revere is saddled up,
the rude bridge arches the ﬂood, and the ROTC is armed!

But I digress, We were smoking Marlboro Cigarettes--O, _

splendid cigarette! 0, good golden tobaccos! O, pristine pure
white ﬁlter! 0, fresh! 0, tasty! 0, soft pack! 0, ﬂip top box!
0, get some!—we were, I say, smoking Marlboros and talking
about spring fashions. '

Let us turn now to the season’s most striking new feature—-
pneumatic underdrawers. These inﬂatable garments make every
chair an easy chair. Think how welcome they will be when you
sit through a long lecture! They are not, however, without
certain dangers. Last week, for example, Rimbaud Sigafoos, a
sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, fell out of a 96th

story window in the Tower of Learning. Thanks to his pneu-
matic underdrawers, he suffered no injury when he struck the
sidewalk, but the poor fellow is still bouncing—'his seventh
consecutive day—and it is feared that he will starve to death.

Panthers.

In the six meetings between the
two clubs, Miami has won ﬁve
times. This season their record is
12-10, and 8-4 in the tough Mid-
American Conference.

The Redskins have "three
players averaging in double
ﬁgures, led by sophomore Jeff

Gehring. The 6-foot-6 forward
is shooting 52‘ per cent from the
field, the same as the Pan-
ther’s,Dave Roman. Gehring has
scored 70 points in his last three
games and is averaging 17
points’ a game.

Other probable starters ‘will be
Charley Coles, Charley Dinkins,
Skip Snow, and Steve Strome.
Coles and Dinkins are the other
players averaging in double. ﬁg-
ures with 12.2 and 10.5 averages
respectively.

For Laekluster Wrestling Record

A By BOB SMIZIK I
Statistics show why the Panther wrestling team compiled
its worst record since 1951, a mediocre, 5-3. In eight matches
the Panthers participated in 68 individual bouts and posted a
31-29-8 record. This" is in far contrast to last year’s squad

which had a 51-20-7 mark in ninev

matches. .

Only three wrestlers were able
to post "records above the .500
level. Mike Johnson, the team’s
lone undefeated member, was
6—0—2,'Jim Harrison was 6-1-1 and
John Carr was 5-3. With the ex-
ception of Lee Hall and Jeff Ware,
who had .500 records, everyone
else had a losing slate.

Harrison and Johnson proved to

By AL BLUMKIN

_ The Panther gymnasts will travel to Syracuse on Thurs-
day to participate in the Eastern League championships Fri-
day and Saturday. Six [schools (Army, Navy, Penn State,
Syracuse, Pitt, and Temple) will, send their best gymnasts

- who will vie ro? individual honors.

Coach IWarren Neiger stated that he would take six men

~— to Syracuse. They are Ed Zamec-

nik, Jack Lehner, Bob Pingatore,
Ed Stim, Roland James and Tom
Misage.

There will be no team scoring
which is for in-
dividual honors only. Syracuse
has already won the Eastern
League competition this season
with a perfect 6-0 mark.

Seward Stars .

The star ofvthe meet will prob-
ably be Tom Seward of Penn
State. Seward just concluded a
ﬁne season, which he capped with
a triple victory against the Pan-_
thers last week. He is favored to
win the free exercise, the parallel

1 bars, and the all-around compe-

tition.
Other all-around gymnasts
A expected to give Seward trouble
are Phil Voas of Syracuse and
Mark Cohn of Temple, with
Ed Zamecnik of ‘the Panthers
-rated as a dark horse. Voas is
also challenging Seward in the
free exercise while Cohn is a
co-favorite with Syracuse's Ray
Grimaldi in the side horse.
The Panthers are strongest in
the long horse, where Jack Leh-
ner and Bob Pingatore will give
defending champion Ray Orlick
of Syracuse a battle. In the hori-
zontal bar Zamecnik ﬁgures to
challenge Tim Phillips of Tem-
ple, Ken Slutsky of; Army and
Seward, all of whom have beaten
the Panther ace in ‘dual-meet
competition. - ‘
In the other event, the still
rings, the Panthers have very
little chance to place. The top

]t’lay—Off Bids
[11 IM Field

Only one definite play-off berth
has been decided for the Intra-
mural Basketball championship
game: and seven others are still
up for grabs.

Holland Ten (record 5-0) out-
classed the Dormitory League to

gain the first bid. The MBA‘

(Masters of Business Admini-
stration) clash with Apartment
“C” tomorrow night to decide
the hotly contested Indepen-
dent “B” League.

Both teams ﬁnished with 5-1
records, but the MBA outlasted
their rivals, 48-46, in an earlier
meeting that went into double
overtime. There were also three
ﬁghts and two ejections.

In all there will be eight teams
in the ﬁeld. There will be two in-
dependent representatives, the
engineering league, the dormitory
league, the fraternity league, the
dental league, and two at-large
berths.

Some of the popular choices to
win the other divisions are the
Civil Engineers, the Buckeyes in
Independent “A” ball and Delta
Sigma Phi in the Greek League.

Post 5-4: Mark

Under Peterson

The Panther Cub basketball
team ‘finished another successful
season under the tutelage of Coach
Carl Peterson and assistant John
Fridley. The team’s ﬁnal record
was ﬁve wins and four losses.

The frosh coach feels. that
Larry Szykowny and Bob Lov-
ette, theionly freshman hoop-
sters on scholarship, may give
some varsity ballplayers com-
petition for their positions next
year. Fridley said, “Some of
those guys on the varsity who
thought they had it made are
going to have to work awfully
hard to keep their jobs.”

Several football players who
came out for the team also pleased
Peterson. By the end of the sea-
son Ed Assid averaged 20 points
a game, and John Verkleren, 12.
Peterson wants both boys to play
jayvee ball next year, and thinks
they may be varsity material in

   

a few years.

defeats the world's best in final
490-mile test section on icy
Alpine cliff roads . . . then
outperforms gyiry sedan on
famous'Monaco circuit!

Falcon picked the world's roughest winter ordeal
to reveal an astonishing new brand of total per-
formance. Four days and three nights through an
inferno of ice, snow, freezing fog, endless curves
—2,5OO miles against an implacable time schedule,
designed to try a car’s reliability, road-holding
and performance to the ultimate. Experts said a
first-time car couldn't hope to finish—and two
thirds of the 296 competitors did drop out. But
Falcon not only placed first and second in its
class, it defeated every car, regardless of class, on
the brutal Chambery-Monte Carlo final leg, set
best time among all finishers in all of the six
special test sections——and showed its heels to
every sedan in the dramatic three-lap elimination
on Monaco’s famous round-the-houses course.
You couldn't get better proof of totalperformance
anywhere! '
