Drive Begins Today

Student Leaders, Members Of Activities Join Together

In Concerted Effort To

Raise Necessary Funds

To Send Band West With Football Team

By "Herbert Rackoﬂ’

“Band to the Rose Bowl” campaigns, beginning today,
make their appearance on campus.

To recognize and reward the efforts of what is admitted
to be one of the finest college units of its kind in the country,
student leaders and members of all student organizations start
a drive for funds today that has every chance of success.

Unofficial pledges from the Band";

itself already total $2,600; aPDI‘0Xi'
mately one-fifth of the necessary
amount.‘ V V '
Facts are all in favor of this move.
Fact 1: for the past three years the
eastern Rose Bowl contender has had
its hand marching out on the Pasa-
dens.‘ greensward between the halves.
U "Fact 2: all over-the East and Mid-
W-est the Pitt Band, both in music
and in drill, has been acclaimed one
of the country's ﬁnest.
Would Win Prestige
;»Fact 3: the prestige and national
notice which the Pitt Band is sure to
arouse 'in California presents priceless
opportunity for the University to
place itself in the national spotlight.
V Fact 4: their strenuous year-round
practice makes Band members en-
tirely deserving of this coast trip.

. Fact 5: as an aid to the football 1

team, the Band will be a ﬁne medium
of expressing the spirit and support
of the student body.

These arguments, according to
members‘ of the drive committee, ex-
press the" sentiment of the entire stu-
dent body as far as they can discover.

Backing the drive are a large num-
ber of important student activities.
The News and the Panther. lead stu-
dent publications in the campaign.
College Association last night went on
record as completely in favor of the
drive, along with Pitt Players, and the
Band V itself. .

Present plans call for boxes to be
placed in advantageous spots all over
school to receive contributions. Aid is
expected from the downtown news-
papers. —

William Schenck, BA37, chairman
of SFA; Irene Matveak, Ed37, editor,
The Panther;.Edwin Beachler, C37,
co-editor, The News; John Shirley,
BA37, student leader of the.band;
Charles Rogers, C37, member of
Men's Council; Louis Bearer, E37,
chairman of the student cheering
block; Alex Leggin, C37, cadet com-
mander, VROTC, ‘and William J arratt.
C37, drum major, are among those
leading the drive. *

and blaclohair, will be the co-ed cap-
tain of the Pitt Riﬂes. She will be

. California ln"'F.ormation VV V

ORMAN MAC LEOD, member of the board of trustees andialumniv
council, admitted Monday night before 70 members of Gamma Circle,

Omicron Delta Kappa, gathered in

the Hotel Schenley banquet room,

that two enthusiastic members of the University band had made a deﬁ-
nite impression on him in their statement that “the bond oughta’ go to

the Rose Bowl.”

. ‘ More impol-l_nn,t,. Mac  further, admitted that he "“weolsened" .

after hearing the convincing story as advanced by the band men.

The V

former Vundergraduote lender cou_ld offer , them‘, much like the many

other prominent University ofﬁciols

the boys,Vhad. ‘_‘busted in on" earlier

that doy, nothing "deﬁnite but the advice to “keep going," in addition
to the names of "a few likely prospects Vwho might light the Rose Bowl I
torch for one of the greatest collegiate bands in the country.

Now if two in that brigade of 130 maneuvering, looting Pitt «bond-
men can accomplish that much with one important graduate of the

University, wewonder what those remaining 128 could do if they were
really interested_ in showing the entire country that this University
has made real progress in the extra-Vcurricular ﬁeld, a ﬁtting tribute to '
one hundred and ﬁfty years of progress. ,

All in the h_ar_d-worlting band brigade are interested, as evidenced
by their readiness to contribute approximately twenty"_dollar_s "per man,
amounting to $2,600, an impressive, dent in the approximated total of
$15,000 to cove:-V the trip out and back. But are they interested to the
extent of deﬁ,nitelVy,caVmpaVigVning for what they want? For they will find
that while the student body may becomeipassively interested in their
project, the rank and ﬁle will be unable to see them through without

constant prodding. V

How _will the end he ,occomplished?V, First, the students "must show
the University authorities that it is extremely important to have the
band make that trip. V The best way to show that is_by contributing
plenty of enthusiasm, and, perhaps, even a few_ dollars to show that
they, too, arepwilling to sacriﬁce to show one hundred thousand "Rose
Bowl fans, and mVillionsV of newspaper readers "the  over, "that
Pitt'sV_extVra-curricular”developments are not centered entirely‘ inlpower

Speaker At Inquiry Lauds
City Manager System,
Discusses Others

 

College students ought to be able
“to beat the average dumb politician
silly” if they take an active interest
in governmental problems, Dr. J. M.
Artman, Chicago educator and editor,
declared before Inquiry Forum Mon-

day noon.

“Students should get into politics,”
he said. “I don't think they can stay
out. If we are going to continue the
System of democracy, the individual
must carry his load in the civic life
of his city. We cannot have a whole-
some individual life unless we have
a wholesome civic life."

Discussing the methods of_the, citi-
zen and stu-dent for expressing their
opinions, he reported, “I think that
resolutions, without any social ca-
pacity behind. them, are Pure bunk-
To make "ourselves heard, We must
take hold of one thing that counts,
and hanging on, do all the thiggs It
takes ‘to bring a solution about.

Dr. A‘_rtman reviewed the move-
ment in‘ Chicago ‘for a city manager
form ‘of ‘government, in whi-ch he is
playing an active part.‘ He expressed
the opinion that it will be a “long
pull,” probably ten years or more,
but he declared that eventually the
city will adopt the city manager
In their campaign, according
to the speaker, he and his associates
are‘a*d.opting the policy of striking
when other people are asleep, rather
than waiting _until election time.

“You, cannot have , government
without interest on the part of the
citizens,” he added. _“If you want to
go into. civic life, goiii with patiepce
and insight on what it is __all about.

Those roses that. the Wash-

- ‘Panthers last week seem to have

a funny smell to everyone ex-
cept the Washington boys, the Pitt
boys, and various loyal Eastern foot-
ball rooters. All over the South, most
of the Pacific Coast, parts of the
Mid-West, and. in sections of the
East the Pitt invitation has been
resented. Southern writers have ridi-
culed it, placing» Loyuisana State A and
Alabama in that “very much abused”
class. Coast fans at last Saturday's
Notre ‘Dame-Southern Cal game at

Los Angelés were reported to have

booed the annou‘nc’ement._that seats
were -on sale for the New Years -Day
classic... 1  -. H " ~ '

- Through-all thecondemnations and

the criticisms it appears that Wash-'

ington. made-thel.toug1/lest choice they
could have..p'os'sibly made. It was
tough because of all the adverse‘ com-
ment it ‘caused. But‘ it-*was'tougher
because the Husky group picked the
hardest team in the country to whip
th-is New Year's Day. In_ this respect
orchids shouldibe handed to Wash-
ington in return for their roses.
lt is our belief that Washington
could not have. possibly «chosen an
opponent that would be harder to
heat than_ the Pitt team. There are
the three defeats‘ in Rose Bowl
games within the last eight years
which the Panthers have suffered,
the last, two being in the form
of miniature explosions .at the

hands of Southern-California. The. .

Panthers will be out there ﬁghting
every minute, they'll be in there
neck deep, trying. for their first
Rose Bowl victory and trying to
:show the Coastthat if Washington
made a bad choice, Washington got

the worstxof. it. , '
It * II V

This years’; Pitt team will have ad-
vantages nb other Panther Rose Bowl

team has had. Sutherland has the re- '

serves, two, teams of almost equal
ability, that is so necessary when the
climate changes from cold to hot.
They are as experienced as any other
Panth.er eleven, their record proves
them as good, and underneath it all,
they have that; sad,v sad -Rose Bowl
record that must be improved.

Washington,_.‘then should be ad-H’
mired for picking the team that ii

will give them the stiffest battle.

Both. Pitt and Washington have‘.

gone through two of -the hardest
schedules listed
schedule books this season. Pitt
has beaten three of. the country's
best by lop-sided scores. Look at_
Ohio State . . .’ the score was only
6-0, but the Panthers proved so
superior to the Buckeyes that day
critics and Columbus could hardly
believe it. I V ,
Then came Notre Dame. The ‘final
score was 26-0, and the Irish were
lucky it wasnt worse than that.
Against the team that was defeated
by Minnesota in the last minute of
play, Nebraska, the Panthers run up
23 ﬁrst d-owns to six, 19 points to 6
and they traveled 1,200 miles to donit.
The two—,_little. black specks on
Pitt’s re,cord,,;_. th;e_,.P;an_th_ers _.owe to .1
Duquesne .and Fordham. On that
I-ainy‘, muddy day in October the
Dukes were the best team,. the.
Panthers deserved to lose but we
believe, and believe ﬁrmly that the
Panthers _could take Duques_n,e.,.o"n
any. other Saturday but that one

muddy one in October.
as“ nor . at

And Orchid . . .

It hurts to read that Fordham
held'Pitt to a tie. That was the day
the Panthers needed two yards for
a touchdown and failed. ln_the
meantime the Rams couldanét get
inside Pitt's 30-yard line unless the .
Panthers had the ball.

Thus it appears that a "great -game
will be offered to the Coast when
Pitt meets Washington. It was only
three years ago that the nation
laughed 7when ' Stanford invited Co-
lumbzia, the .nation thought that the
Indians had picked a soft touch. Yet
the score came over the wires as Co-
lumbia 7,‘ Stanford 0. So to you
Washington‘, we send not roses, but
orchids for picking ‘as your opponent
the one team in the country most
likely to whip-you on New‘ Year's
Day. '

even King Edward and Stan Baldwin
have stirred up in the Court. of St.

part of this country. That?s where
basketball players are born. First

In the,Windy City the boys will
spend most" of their time cavorting
a-round theibasketball courts of N orth-
western and DePaul Universities.
Northwestern is played on Friday
night and DePaul will be met on Sat-
urday. The rest of the time they’ll
spend wandering around the lobbies
of the luxurious Palmer House.

DePaul was a semi-ﬁnalist in the
Olympic tryouts last year. With
Sunday taken out for rest, the trip
will be completed with a game at In-
dianapolis against Butler University
Monday. The team will return home
Tuesday.

Six weeks of practice seems to have
put the Panthers into starting gun

Panther_s-Pick Four
Ram Players On
A11-Opponent

When, along about this time of the
year, so-called football savants from
the Yankee Stadium to the Rose Bowl
go into a huddle and then come out
with their impressions as to the 11
best out of some 600 assorted college
football players in the nation, a ﬂy-
.ng wedge of criticism swings int<
action.

Dodging this skepticism, and witl
all due deference to the gentlemen
who sit in.~the- warmly-heated» pres.~
boxes during the entire season, The
Pitt News has questioned what it con
siders the most competent source fox
the selection of great gridmen.

Today The News announces th<
All-Opponent and-All-American foot
,ball~t_ean_1,s',’~asv elected by the ballot
of the Pitt. varsity football squad.

‘ ~' ‘Four Ram_Block~_s Picked_'v- A

' When better football: ‘players -are
to be judged, ask the man who
played against them. With this view-
point, it’ becomes apparent that the
sturdiest aggregations that encount-
ered the Panthers this year were
Fordham, Ohio State, and ‘Nebraska‘'
Four Rams,”three fromitlie Buckeyes .
and two Cornhuskers were ﬁrst ii
the way" of Pitt opposition. The re-‘
mainder ofitheeleven men ‘came fron
Pitt’s two" pesky Pittsburgh rivals’
Carnegie Tech and Duquesn_e._

That the Panthers did _not takc
Fordham’s Seven Blocksyfor granted
is certain. Four Ramlinemen took
their places with each having a com’.
manding leadfover other opponents
lines. Wojiechowicz at center received

the high number of 27 out of 3a, '

votes. Pierce at guard was given 25,
Paquin received 19, and Franco was
given 15. . _

Merle Wendt, Ohio State captain
led the polling in thenend voting with
24 ‘votes. His teammates‘, Tippy Dyc
at quarterback, and‘Hamrick at- the
other tackle were placed high-on the
ﬁrst team. .

What! No, lhasrak?

Nebraska’s strong backs were
ranked highly. Sam Francis was the
unanimous choice for fullback, the
only playerto be chosen on every bal-
lot. Lloyd Cardwell, the Cornhuskers’
hard running halfback, led the half-
backs with .25 _ votes. Boyd !Brum-
baugh. of Duquesne. was Cardwell’s
running mate, with 23 votes.

Signiﬁcant in these ballots were
three salient. facts. The ﬁrst. was that
Duquesne’s widely publicized center,
Mike Basrak, did not receive one
vote. Another is the selection of Ed
Franco of For-dham. at one of the
tackle Dositions instead of his team-
mate, Barbartsky,

Although Franco was given the
plurality by. the team's total, Bar-
bartsky was preferred by the. two Pitt‘
tackles, Daniell and Matisi. Third
of course, is the unanimous selection:
of Sam Francis to both teams. -

Championship Honors

wo GENTLEMEN from New York, broth-

ers, long-established jewelers, and sportsmen,
step‘ off aplane at the county airport landing ﬁeld
some time this morning.

The Lambert brothers, Henry L. and Victor A.,
are well-known and successful as the result of
continuing the jewelry business of their father.
the late August A. Lambert, who some seventy
years ago‘-established the first wholesale jewelry
business in New York City. .

At l1:30,o’clock they will arrive to occupy two
seats reserved for them on the stage of Memorial
Hall. -Shortly thereafter, Victor A. of the Lam-
bert brother combination, presents to the foot-
ball — team of this University the first annual
award of the August V. Lambert memorial tro-
.phy. Bobbie‘ La Rue, veteran blocking and ball-
carrying halfback, will receive the trophy for
jock Sutherland’s eastern champions. and W111
make_.a shortacceptance speech of thanks for the
squad. ’ ‘ ' . _ _

j..Pitt receives this tribute of greatness indicat-
ing sup_remacy over, or at least equality to, all
sections of the country. The squad has been sin-
gled out over "Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Ford-
h'am,:;.Ya1'e, Navy, and others, for its fine sports-
manship, coordinated team play, and keen com-
petitive spirit. _

It. was... the spirit of Pitt and its supporters
that "impressed the Board of Trustees and foot-
ball writers who voted Dr. S_utherland’s gridmen
the award.»

,Su'c’h illustrious rmen as Postmaster-General
James‘ A. Farley,‘ Col. John Reed Kilpatrick,
president of Madison Square Garden, and Kermit
Roosevelt, s'on”of the late great President, are
among those who recognized in Pitt this year
greatpqualities of sportsmanship and top-notch
football...“ " '

Following the trophy presentation, the other
brother, Henry L. Lambert, presents individual
certiﬁcatésfof recognition to the coaches, and
every member of the squad. ,

In conclusion, we predictthat these two well-
liked sportsmen will have a few things to say
as to Nelw'York and national opinion concerning
th-is 1936 championship football squad. Perhaps
they maypven have a message that they want the
boys to éarry on to the Rose Bowl!

This is a truly great day in the athletic history
of the University.

‘ ‘Why is it that every time something good comes along
SFA fumbles around until it succeeds in spoiling a per-
fectly good idea? ' _

No longer do we hear very ardent_ complaints con-
cerning the handling _of dance appointments or pep
assemblies, but every time something new comes up we
are ledto believe that the only way to teach these ama-
teur legislators. is by rote.

Last month a very splendid suggestion was made for
the introduction into the curriculum of a course on sex
education. Then one of the members moved to refer
the matter to the executive committee. Anyone who
knows anything about our executive committee knows
that the quickest and surest way of modifying and ﬁ-
nally of killing a promising motion is to refer it to the
executive committee. Sure enough, the expected thing
happened——-the motion was ruined by the committee.

The '*maker of the motion obviously had in mind a
course on sex education, and not one on Eugenics and

\Euthenics. It seems‘ perfectly asinine for the Executive
Committee to propose such a course when the obvious
intent of the maker was nothing like the action they
took. Eugenics is taught -in a course in the Biology De-
partment and concerns, generally, questions of ‘improv-
ing the race by proper mating. Euthenics concerns’ the
improvement of the race by a modiﬁcation of external
inﬂuences aside from hereditary factors. It is handled
by the Department of Sociology in courses in Heredity
and Environment.
either of these two departments means unnecessary

duplication of service, and represents a useless waste ‘

of effort. ,

A course on sex education should concern itself with
discussions of syphilis and gonorrhea, their cure, and
means of preventing them. It should be a practical
course in actual-“ sex relationshi s-——‘.hose matters that
make avid readers‘ for dime-nove publishers; those mat-
ters that shock nineteenth century inoralists, but which
are essential to a more complete understanding of life
itself. Such a course should deal with everyday sex
problems of all normal human beings—those things that
are, at present, dragged in the mud, hidden by most
people behind shades of mystery and utmost secrecy.
_The time has come for our educators to lead the wav
into an open, above-board discussion.

How would the thirty students for such a proposed
course be chosen? On the basis of virility? Why
shouldn't all students be eligible to take‘ such a course?
The time has long since passed when we must take many
unnecessary precautions while discussing such vital prob-
lems as concern _all of us. Who is arbitrarily to say
which thirty seniors are most deserving of the honor

of beingthe ﬁrst to take such a course?

F_urthermore,_ experiment does not seem necessary or
advisable. If ideas on organization of such a course
are desired, why not write to faculty members at Syra-

gcuse, or any other school in which such a course has

been tried and found successful? Why should several
hundred seniors be denied the right of gaining immedi-
ate knowledge on sex relationships, so that they might
be better equipped to meet the problems of life?

Student sentiment behind such a course is tremen-
dous! The course should be introduced immediately!
It has proved successful elsewhere, and it can work suc-
cessfully here. SFA should not muff this opportunity
do prove its worth as a real student governing body.

OOKING, JUST LOOKING, is a favorite national
pastime. We look for hours at motion pictures,
look in store windows, stop to examine “cute” hats
or expensive sets of golf clubs, and ordinarily we
admit to the salesman that we're “just looking” before
we pass on to look at something else. Even the Supreme
Court looks at precedent before it passes on something
for someone else to look at and grunt.

Telescoptovision Looks Ahead

PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T heard of the invention that

has just been patented. It’s called telescoptovision.
It looks into the future, but it won't be marketed until
its backers are guaranteed a “fair financial return.”
Quite by accident, while looking for something to write
about, I met its inventor, Marconi Jenkins, the other
day. He was in an expansive mood, having just been

cheered by the promise that he wouldn’t have to starve,’

any more if he waited long enough. When I appeared
to be skeptical about the machine, he invited me to
have a look at it.

“That’s the only thing I haven't perfected,” he said.
after I had asked to see some national affairs of the
near future. “This machine is just like a camera-—when
you get too close, the subject is out of focus.
try New York first.”

He pressed a button, and blue light spirited across
a tube that looked like a giant telescope and ﬂashed
white on a screen at its end. A hum burred from the-
loud-speaker overhead and a whistle of static that
sounded like a three-tube radio of 1926. Black and gray
merged with the white on the screen into the blurred
picture of a room in which men sat around a long

table. One man stood, talking, his voice coming weakly,
disconnectedly :

“Gentlemen . . . must defend our loans to the .
government . . . there is no other way . . . must go
to war. . . .”

* * * *
Wherein Scenes Change

ENKINS TURNED the dial, shifting the scene to
Washington three weeks later. The white screen

dimmed again into a picture: An office with just two‘

men, still fuzzily out of focus. The loud-speaker
hummed and broke into words as a gray-haired ﬁgure
leaned close to the other man:
“Mr. President . .7 must be done.
war, America’s prestige . . . will be nil.
or . . . second-rate power hereafter . . .”
iA1most distinct, the next picture was that of a man

in military uniform standing before a microphone.

If . . . wins the
We must act

talking:
“It is not a question . . . war or peace . . . the States
must fight . . . is a question of right. We must save

9’
o

the world for . .

“Too bad we can’t hear everything they’re saying,”
Jenkins murmured as he turned the dial, “but here,
strap this around your wrist.” He handed me a copper
band wired to the Telescoptovision. I tightened it on,
wondering, while he turned the dial. He kept turning it
until the picture became as clear as a summer snapshot.

Then The Shell Hit

SQUAD OF GRIMY, mud-splattered soldiers were
climbing hurriedly from a trench. Machine gun
rattling mingled with the boom of shells as they started

‘for the gun nest. Men began to tumble down, but the
rest went on, throwing grenades as they ran. The rat-
tling stopped. One of the squad tore over sprawling
bodies and bayonetted a dazed enemy.

The man clung on to him when the attacker pulled
the blood-dripping bayonet from his shoulder, but ac-
cording to the best rules outlined in the War Depart-
ment’s “Spirit of the Bayonet,” the attacker 'drove in
his knee below his foe’s belt and gouged out his eyes
with his thumbs. The man went down again——with the
bayonet thrust in his chest.

Suddenly there was the whine of a shell and the
detonation of a brilliant explosion. The screen went
white and the loud-speaker stopped.

“Too much vibration for that tube,” Jenkins said,

“but, say, you sure got your man.” ”
“I got my man? What do you mean? I asked. _
“You’re the one who did the fancy bayonetting; didn’t
you rgcognize _yours<Ialf?'1dI bid you strap that ltiland
aroun your wrist so cou pic up your_wave eng s.’
“But I’m a paciﬁst. How did I get mtg the.war?”
“I don't know that,” admitted Jenkins, but its too
bad I don't. have another tube; we could see if you
survived.”

vania-West Virginia United Young

discussions on the theme, “Chris-
tianity and the ‘American Dream.”

‘ Sponsored by; college and local YM
and YWCA’s and young people’s
church organizations, the meetings
were attended by representatives of
15 colleges from the tri-state area.
Experts on social and religious work
led the meetings.

“Discussion and action on problems
of public affairs have. a distinct and
necessary place in the work of re-
ligious organizations,” ' believes Dr.
Joseph M.» Artman of Chicago, who
add1'essed,the general session of the
Institute on Friday evening. Dr. Art-
man’s talk was followed by a general

discussion of the purposes of the In-_

stitute, which were, “To examine so-
cial questions from the Christian
point of View by getting accurate
technical information on problems
discussed, an understanding’ of the
human values involved, and plans for
action which can make -Christian‘
idealism effective.” K

In ‘his address at the‘ Saturday
morning meeting, on “Training for

in the 18th and 19th‘

fairs.” DI‘. Douglas Steere of Haver-
ford College declared, “The tragedy
of our present Christian strategy is
that we have failed to see the con-
nection ‘between our own motives and
the spirit of other people. We are in-

clined to judge ourselves by our‘

ideals and others by their actions.”
Following Dr. Steere’s address, the
Institute divided into four seminar
groups.
One seminar, directed by Dr. Art-
man, considered the work

of the ‘
church and state in securing social .

‘change. “Economic Life and Oppor-
tunity for Youth” was the topic for '‘

discussion in another seminar, led by
Kingman Eberhart, instructor ' in
economics at the University.

Dr. Kermit Eby, former head of a ,

good-will mission to Japan and ex-

pert in international "relations, and-

_Dan West, worker for the Emergency "
Peace Campaign, headed the seminar"

on peace. .

Salient points of the rapidly devel— .

oping cooperative movement were
considered in the fourth seminar, di-
rected by Dr. Maxwell Adams, secre-
tary for the Presbyterian Board of
Education, and C. W. Mason, read-
ers’ counselor at Carnegie_¢_ Library,
who has founded many cooperative
enterprises.
