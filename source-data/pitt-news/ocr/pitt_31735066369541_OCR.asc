Committee
Looks For
Top Director

By JEFF COUCH ‘
Pitt News Staff Writer
The four to six finalists chosen by
a search committee that is
screening candidates for a new
student activities director will have
to possessa variety of outstanding
traits, according to Robert Gal-

. lagher, chairman of the committee.

Those traits include’ a strong
sense of personal integrity, good
writing and speaking skills and a
high energy level to cope with job
stress and long working hours.

Gallagher heads a committee of
nine students and university
officials responsible for interview-
ingxand narrowing the expected
large ﬁeld of candidates.

The committee was charged last
week by Conney Kimbo, vice
chancellor for the office of student
affairs, to begin its search.
According to Gallagher and a
committee procedure sheet, the
committee will rate the applicants
on a three-point scale. Rating ‘one’
means the applicant “looks good

Pitt students can expect another tuition increase
this fall, but university officials apparently are un-
sure how much it will be, or even when the increase
will be approved by the Board of Trustees.

Pitt’s budget (and any tuition increase) is usually
considered at the May meeting of the board.
With Harrisburg legislators still debating the state
budget, however, administrators here are delaying

the question of tuition until the Harrisburg

situation become clearer.

“Unless there is some rapid action in Harrisburg
this week, we do not intend to present a budget in
May,” said Edward Bozik, assistant chancellor.

There will probably be no“‘rapid action” from
Harrisburg this week. The General Assembly is
scheduled to recess Friday for the May 15 primary
(one day before the trustees’ spring meeting) and
will not return until May 21. '

Gov. Richard Thornburgh’s 6.3 billionbudget

includes a four percent increase in appropriations

for Pitt. Chancellor Wesley Posvar told state

  Tuition Increase:How Much And When?

Vandalism
Prompts
Search

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Vandalism in Lothrop Hall at the
end of the winter term has
prompted an investigation by
campus police to find those
responsible for the damages. '

Most of the damage occurred on
the 10th and 14th floors of the
residence h 1.

Fred Fonseca, director of the ,

Office of Residence Life, said
damages were discovered after
most residentsleft the dormitory
for the sunlmer. N
“When students left this year,
the damage was considerably

worse than in the past,” he said. f

Semi-public areas-like hallways
and lounge areas were hit the
hardest with glass doors smashed
and walls covered with writing and
paint. .

Don Hughes, housing director,
said it will cost about $1,800 to
repair damages on the 10th and
14th floors. P

legislators last month that such an increase will not
be enough to stave off another tuition hike at Pitt».

In the past few weeks, state Democrats have

developed a budget of their own, one which is $48
million less than Thornburgh’s and includes a seven
percent increase for Pitt and other state-related
universities. ,

It will be interesting to see which budget‘ Pitt of-
ficials base their tuition increase on. If the increase
is based on Thorniburgh’-s budget and the

Democrats ultimately have their way by September,

Pitt students could end up needlessly paying more i T

for tuition.‘ -~

Bozik said that if tuition is not considered at the
May meeting, it will have to be considered at the
board’s executive committee meeting in June.
There are only 12 members on the executive com-
mittee, including Posvar, Chairman Roger
Ahlbrandt and Vice Chairman Robert Kirby.
Bozik said, however, that “‘any board member”
may attend a meeting in which a major decision is
to be made. ’

It is worth remembering, however, that Posvar
reported to the Senate Council nearly a year ago
that no tuition increase would be discussed at the
May trustees meeting—one week before the trustees
tacked on another $25 dollars. to students fall in~

Routing To Tighten Security  

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer .

Pitt students returning to the
Litchﬁeld Towers next year will
have to become accustomed to
extensive changes in security
measures that the offices of
University Housing and Residence
Life have already begun to
institute.

“The changes are an outgrowth
of concern expressed by students,
faculty and staff which took place
after the death of Monica Renee
Jones,” said Fred Fonseca, di-
rector of the Office of Residence
_Life.

Jones, an undergraduate, was
raped and strangled in the Towers
A basement laundry facility last
January.

Remodeling of the towers lobby,
which has begun, will relocate
laundry facilities from the base-
ment to a site located between the
lobby and Tower C, on the lobby
level. ' ’

The remodeled lobby will also i

provide additional access to the
Towers cafeteria.

Fonseca said housing officials
are trying to cut off accessibility to
the basement garage area for
students except for parking cars.

“There will be a 24-hour desk
coverage at all of our residence hall
facilities,” Fonseca added.

In the past, towers desk coverage
was in effect only during evening
hours. b

Ultimately, identiﬁcation badges
will be worn by all employees who
work or have access to the
residence halls. Some are wearing
the badges now.

“If astudent suspects a person is
in the building without an
identification badge, they should
call for assistance,” Fonseca said.

After the fall term check-in
period Towers elevators will be
re-routed. Currently, the middle’
elevator stops on all floors while
outside elevators stop every thre
floors. '

Once re.-routing is completed, -

each elevator will stop every three
floors.

Keys will be necessary for entr
into each living area. ‘

“This will force people in the
stairwell, and, unless they have a
key, people will be stuck in the
stairwell,” Fonseca said. “They
will have no place else to go.”

Fonseca said university officials
are investigating the possibility of
placing mirrors or reﬂectors in the
stairwellsi so students can see
around the corners. However,
Fonseca said he is worried that
students may take the mirrors to
hang in their rooms..

“Ifm hoping that students .are
security conscious enough to leave
them alone,” he said.

' The ORL and the housing/office
are currently planning a security
program as part of freshmen
orientation in June. Although the

program is still in the planning‘

stages, it will include all topics
iconcemirig university security.

rating ‘two’ means the applicant
“is a possibility but do not
investigate the applicant further at
this time and rating ‘three’ means
the applicant “is not qualiﬁed for
‘this position and will not be given
further consideration.” I
Gallagher said the committee
will review the full credentials of
each candidate receiving a ‘one’
rating and conduct telephone
reference checks upon receiving
the candidates’ permission. “With
a telephone referegce check,” he
said, “we are more likely to get a
betler feel for the person.”
’ Committee members will again
rate these candidates and those
that retain a ‘one’ rating will be
invited to the university for
interviews.

Committee to Search
For Qualified Director

“We hope these procedures will
provide a very representative
group of candidates,” Gallagher
said.

With input from other groups on
campus, plus the opinions of
committee members, Gallagher
said he ‘will send a list of three to
ﬁve finalists to Kimbo.

Kimbo will make the final
decision based on the list of
finalists.

According to the timetable
established by Kimbo, a new

be named by July and assume
responsibilities August 1.

dormitories closed at noon. He
said that some students may have
remained in the dorm to party.

“My guess is that much of it
happened after resident assistants
left,” Fonseca said.

Housing officials permitted some
students who planned to attend
spring session to stay in Lothrop
after April 21st. Those students
had to pay additional room fees to
remain there.

Campus police and university
officials have questioned students
who remained during the interim
period between winter and spring
and have “a (couple of leads
there,” Fonseca said.

Damages to any rooms in the
dorm will be billed to the person(s)
who lived in that room during the
winter term. Payment for'damages
in semi-public areas will be difficult
to collect, however, Hughes said.

“We’ll probably go after them
through the campus judicial
system,” he said.

Both Fonseca and Hughes said
all resident students will have to

pay for vandalism in the long run.

“This has io have an impact'on

“We are not talking about ten

added.

Security Measures Taken
In Litchfield Towers

(Continued from page I)

Fonseca said he is taking a “hard
look” at sanctioning visitation rules
violations. Although he said rules
have not been lax in the past, he is
considering removing students
from ‘the residence hall who
blatantly violate the rules.

Fonseca said he hopes students
will cooperate to maintain the
security of the residence halls.

“If we don’t have intelligent
cooperation on the students’ part,
it’s not going to work,” he said.
“There is only so much we can
do.”

The Office of Residence Life has

a new entrance to accomodate the‘

 WHY CM-BBT?

“What I do about contraception is my business. After all, it’s my life.
CM—BBT keeps me in control without Fooling my body.

  
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
   
 
 
  

CM—BBT stands for Cervical Mucus and Basal Body Temperatulre——
two biological cycles which allow me toeffect contraception. I found
out about CM—BBT at my Family Planning Center. The experts
there were just the kind of people I wanted to see. Professional.
Knowledgeable. Straightforward. Honest.

Family Planning Centers offer many contraceptive options, but
considering my lifestyle and outlook, I decided on CM—BBT.
This method has beenthoroughly researched, investigated and
tested by scientists and doctors. It is a procedure which I under-
stand and feel comfortable with,’ and it does not interfere with
my body in any way. There’s no medical risk involved—and
no crossed fingers. ,
Don't use CM—BBT without professional guidance. With the
help of my Family Planning Counselor, I learned how to
detect, monitor and analyze my body cycles. Recognizing
these physical changes tells me whether I am fertile ornot.

The CM—BBT method has been tested at 90-95 percent effec- _
tiveness. It is safe, effective and proven. If you’re looking,
for another choice in contraception, consider CM—BBT. -—

What About
Security?

_At long last, there will be a revamping of security
procedures in the Towers dormitories.

The changes, effective this fall, will include the
remodeling of the laundry facilities in Tower B

I .base‘ment—where freshman Monica Renee Jones met

T Other changes include remodeled Towers Lobby
which will feature a new entrance to the cafeterias in
the basements of Towers A and C. University em-
ployees will wear identification badges and, ac-
cording to Fred Fonesca, head of the Office of
Residence Life, housing officials are trying to cut off
accessibility to the basement garage area except for
when students are parking their cars.

Most importantly, the sign-in ritual——in which

students previously had to sign in guests, and reveal

their own residency identification to obtain admit-
tance into the dorms—has been extended to 24 hours.

Previously, it ran from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.

These changes will be in effect in September.
After the check-in period, elevators will be rerouted.

/“The changes are an outgrowth of concern ex-
pressed by students, faculty and staff which took
place after the death of Monica Renee Jones,” said
Fonseca.

All well and good, but the fact remainslthat bet-
ween Jones’ January death and Fonseca’s announ-
cements, nothing was done to improve security mat-
ters. Students may have been sent to Lothrop for
Spring Term instead of the traditional Towers, but
all the same, for over four months, students ran the
same risks.

It is easy to say that itwas difficult to instigate new
measures while students were living in the dorm, but
it is equally true that the Office of Residence Life was
aware of the severity of the inadequate security

Perhaps it is unfair to speculate that, had stricter
security been in effect in January, Jones would still
be alive, since the events around her murder are still
unclear. But hundreds of students lived in those
dorms, used that laundry room for months after-
wards, presumably risking the same odds.

A question still on our minds concerns Lothrop,
site of at least one official rape last fall. Fonseca an-

‘nounced no new plans for that dormitory.

Lothrop, incidentally, featuresia 24-hour security
system.

The Office of Residence Life may be taking a step T
"in the right direction, but there are so many paths

that _must be crossed without so much as a Travelor’s
Advisory Warning.

I used to call it summer vacation
and it started in June and there
iawere three lazy months to get a
sunburn and swim and play tennis.
Now, I’m taking coursé's spring
session instead of loaﬁng or
working a summer job and the
magic of vacation remains not only
intact but almost mystical in

' springtime.

Spring—'like a line from an E.E.
Cummings poem. It comes with
the sweetly heavy smell of
freshly mowed grass in a faintly
misty haze of warm spring rain. It
comes with the ﬂashing signs of
reopened drive-ins, in the dripping
sweetness of a half melted twist
cone from the local ice cream
stand, but most of all, spring comes
in the form of playing. Games,

system.

activities that have been ignored
for months.

Like bicycling and tennis, like
badminton and horseback riding.
And, especially, like cruising.

Cruising along with the radio
going full blast—like the opening
scenes from “Happy Days,” like
an outtake from “American Graf-
ﬁtti”—now, that’s summer.

A car without a radio is, well, a
day without sunshine. What it
really is, is unthinkable. A radio is
essential in cruising. Not a tape
deck—_1hat’s too cooly contrived.
You know what to expect, it’s all
Billy Joel or all Boston or all
Fleetwood Mac and there is no
mystery, no intrigue to it. The car
zips alongat a nice even pace—no
swift swoops around curves to the
lofty layered sound of, say, Electric
Light Orchestra followed by a high

speed charge down an interstate to

some very basic Rolling Stones.

Oh, the joys of Top Forty—the
whole world, at least, the whole
road, seems to revolve around the
radio. On my way to school, I can
switch on 96 KX and the trip down
pothole-ridden Route 8—which is
very much like trying to dodge the
booby traps in a mine field—boun-
ces stations up to a static ridden
WYDD by the time I cross the
bridge for Oakland. g

certain type of music? My nifty but
battered little Mustang 11 matches
with the breezy California sound
of the early Beach Boys and the
Outlaw school of rock regulars
Warren Zevon and Jackson
Browne.

But my neighbor has this sleek
little TR-7 which was absolutely
made for cruising‘ to classic Led
Zeppelin (for fastdriving) or Bob
Welch (for small-town traffic) or
even Al Stewart (heavy traffic but
only. when the driver is in a

whimsical mood). And another

friend’s classy black Fiat goes with

nothing so well as The Carz.
Bruce Springsteen, of course,

goes well with any make of car, ,

while Barry Manilow doesn’t fare
well at all on the open road.

Cars and cruising to the
radio—that’s "summertime. When
my college days are replaced in my
brain, they will unfold to a score
that will start with “Born to Run”
and fade out to the strains of
“Sultans of Swing.”

Oakland ’s Litter Problem Widespread

Having been a resident of the
Towers since September, I have

‘JP Hou.)A{<D°

noted, with discouragement, the
substantial amount of litter gen-
erated here in the Pitt community.

Occuring both within and outside
dormitories’ and academic build-

ings, the; utterly senseless. and"

careless act of littering frequently
reaches absurd heights, as it has on
at least two. occasions in the past
few days, with the discarding of
thousands of data cards from
windows in the quad and Towers to
the sidewalks and streets below.

Although these incidents are
extreme, one need only open his or

her eyes to see that the problem of
litteringis widespread in the Pitt
community.

Perhaps the first and most
effective way of dealing with this
unsightly nuisance if for those who
live, work and attend school at Pitt
to exert pressures on our peers that
are so willing to deface our
surroundings. Further, the Cam-
pus Police should increase their
enforcement activities in this area.

completed in Saturday’s track meet
between the undefeated Panther-
ettes and visiting Kent State, the
score was knotted at 60-all.

Pitt, needing to win at least two
of the three remaining relay
events, easily won the sprint
medley, two- and one-mile relays
to put away KSU, 75-60.

For a while it appeared as if the
Pantherettes would not be able to
catch up to the Flashes, who used
their depth in most events to
outscore the short-handed host
team. Pitt needed the one-two
ﬁnish of high jumpers Karen
Krichko and Marie Ribik to pull up
to the" Flashes before the start of
the ﬁnal relay races.

Krichko, a senior, topped off her
last home performance at Pitt
Stadium with a new team record of
5-9‘/4 and was followed by senior
Ribik’s clearance of 5-6. KSU’s ace
jumper, Maureen Decker, was

‘third at 5-5.‘ _
Pitt started off well, as Marie

Huff, Carmen Scherich and Donna
Wachnowsky swept the javelin
competition. The Pantherettes also

performance out of as few players
as possible.

An interesting sidelight to Jones’
case is Tampa’s selection in the

quarterback from Penn State.
Jones and Fusina should make an
interesting rookie pass-and—catch

Another Pitt player,» Dave Logan,
was also taken by Tampa in the
12th and ﬁnal round. A middle
guard in college, Logan hopes to

-have an easier transition to Tampa
because it utilizes a 3-4 defense. In
addition, the Bucs drafted only one
defensive lineman besides Logan,
defensive end Reggie Lewis from
North Texas State. ‘

Faced with a similar situation as
Logan’s is Jeff Delaney, drafted by
the Los Angeles Rams in the
seventh round. The Rams chose

won the ﬁrst two running events
(Brenda Chorpenning, three-mile
run and the 440-relay of Leslie
Palmer, Cissy Wilborn, Gwen
Murray and Linda Mitchell) but
were hurt by one-two Kent State
ﬁnishes in the middle distances
and 220.

Palmer was a double-winner,
capturing the 100-meter hurdles
and 100-yard dash. Pitt’s Wilborn
broke the team long jump record
with an effort of 18-6.

The ﬁnal three relay teams were:
the medley relay of Palmer,
Wilborn, Mitchell and Murray; a
last-minute combination of ‘half-
miler Maria Sciullo, high jumper
Ribik, Margie Lee (winner of the
mile and, several minutes earlier,
two-mile run), and Chorpenning.
The Pantherettes’ mile relay
consisted of Murray, Louise‘ Carl-
son, Krichko and Mitchell.

Murray," whose quarter-mile
splits in both relays were under 55
seconds, will be a favorite at this
weekend’s EAIAW championships,
having run a 53-second open 40
earlier this season.

Adding to Chesley’s woe is

    Pitt Batmen Split Doubleheaders
With Clarion, Penn St. Nittany Lions

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt’s baseball team (13-4)
split weekend double-headers with
Clarion and Penn State to keep its
NCAA playoff hopes alive.
Against Clarion Saturday at
Trees Field, the Panthers lost the
ﬁrst game, 3-0, in 12 innings, but
won the second, 7-4, as pitcher Jim
Boyle raised his record to 2-0.

Sunday’s doubleheader against
Penn State (14-4) followed a similar
pattern. The Nittany Lions won the
ﬁrst game, 1-0, and Pitt the
second, 7-5. -

“One thing I can say about this
team that I couldn’t say last year is
that we’re more mentally tough,”
said Pitt coach Bob Lewis. “Our
attitude being the way it is, no one
will ever take two (sweep a
doubleheader) from us.

“This is quite a credit to the
maturity of our team,” Lewis said.
“Q_ur team has‘ much more
character and can handle a

scored

situation that a team of lesser
character couldn’t handle. ,

(“Any other team would have
folded against Clarion,” Lewis
continued. “Losing the ﬁrst game
in extra innings hurt, but our guys
came back strong in the second
game and won. They wouldn’t let
down. The same thing happened
against Penn State.”

In Saturday’s ﬁrst game, Clarion
its three runs with a
combination of two walks, one Pitt
error, a flyout and two singles.

Mike Luciow was the Panthers’
starting pitcher, but was replaced
by freshman Larry Lamonde in the
top of the 12th. «-

Lamonde, 1-1 and a_ graduate of
Pittsburgh’s Central Catholic High
School, was the losing pitcher.

Meanwhile, in Sunday’s loss,
Panther pitcher Allen Lachowicz
(3-1) allowed only three hits, but
Penn State made two of them count
as it scored the game’s only run on
two second inning singles.

» La‘chowicz,‘~, -a freshman from

McKees Rocks, struck out eight
and allowed no walks as he
suffered his ﬁrst collegiate defeat.

In the nightcap, Pitt picked up),
six runs in the sixth inning to’

defeat Penn State. Shortstop Marc
Massa led Pitt with three hits and
three runs batted in. Each Panther
had at least one hit. .

Pitt, according to Lewis, sup-
ported its hitting with solid
pitching. Don Koller, recovering
from the ﬂu, was the winning
pitcher, while reliever Tim Moran
picked up the save. Koller’s record
is now 3-1.

BASEBALL NOTES: Pitt,
having played three straight
doubleheaders, met Bucknell in a
single game yesterday at Trees
Field...Lewis did not believe
Saturday’s doubleheader againsjr,
Clarion would be played.

“The ﬁeld was wet, but the
ground crew did a super job getting
the ground ready,” Lewis said,
noting that water was actually
swept off the ﬁeld.
