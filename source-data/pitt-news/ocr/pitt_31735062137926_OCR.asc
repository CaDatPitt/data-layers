Modern L a n g u a g e Professor
Leads Opening International
Relations Assembly

Believing Germany is attempting to
befriend Jugoslavia and win her
away from France, Dr. J. F. L.
Raschen, professor of modern lan-
guages who has just returned from
Germany, will explain his views to a
student conference on international
relations today.

The conference is the ﬁrst of a
series on international problems ar-
ranged by a group under Betty Glass,
It will be held at 12:30 o’clock
in Room 315, Alumni hall.

“Every nation is attempting to ob-
tain allies,” Dr. Raschen said, “Ger-
many is merely following the trend
set by France, Italy and other coun-
tries.”

Commenting on Hitler's policy in re-
gard to the recent Nazi massacre, Dr.
Raschen declared:

“This revolt was a mutiny which if
allowed to continue would have re-
sulted in the death of thousands. I
am not in sympathy with all of Hit-
ler's policies, but I try to understand
them as any intelligent person would.”

On the youth movement in Ger-
many, Dr. Raschen remarked:

“To those of us who have not seen
Germany for some time, the youth
movement was most impressive. The
younger generation is taking the lead
in solving the problems which con-
fronted the country. This is the op-
posite of the condition here where the
youth is not consulted in regard to
governmental problems.”

Dr. Raschen believes that profes-
sors of leading universities whom he
met were entirely in sympathy with
the. youth movement.

In regard to the economic condition.

of Germany, he stated:
“The prophecy of bread lines this
winter in Germany is brushed aside.

The government has announced thati
there will be no lack of foodstuffs, and 3

that a rise in prices willnot be toler-E _
sin the motor of his cycle.

ated.”

Summing up Hitlerism, Dr. Raschen
said:

“Hitlerism is no more vociferous
than the fascism of Mussolini. The
sign of the times is a trend toward
nationalism, and Hitler has his own
ideas about it.”

 

Freshmen Meet
Advisers Friday

Closer Faculty- Student Contact
Assists In Major Choice

“ ‘Our product untouclied by human

hands,’ is a good slogan for a well—i
known breakfast food company,” says{

Dr. O_ C. lHeld, personnel assistant to
the dean of the College, “but it won’t
do for a university. To encourage a
closer association between student
and professor is one purpose of the
meeting of freshmen with faculty ad-
visers.”

The ﬁrst of these meetings will be'

held Friday. Freshmen have been as-
signed their advisers.

“The main purpose of these confer
ences,” said Dr. Held, “is to aid the
freshnian in selecting a major. Most
freshmen haven't any idea what major
they want to take when they enter
school, A faculty member advises each
freshman throughout the year and at
the end of the term helps him select
his course for the following year.

“The system is not original with
us " he added. “The University of
Chicago started it and had very suc-
cessful results. At present our facil-
ities do not permit us to establish the
plan on as large a scale. Perhaps
when the Cathedral is ﬁnished we can
enlarge.”

Mayor McI\’air Speahs
At Columbus Parade

Honorable Vvilliam N. McNair,
mayor of Pittsburgh, spoke at the Co-
lumbus Day Parade, which assembled
at the Cathedral, Friday.

The mayor said that Columbus is to
be admired not for his fearlessness in
sailing uncharted seas
ing a new frontier for Western Eu-

said Mr_ McNair, “someone Who Will
point out the new frontier around us,
the unused land which can be used to
produce food and work for our unem-
ployed men, We need a Columbus to-
day.”

Mines Cabinet To Form

Mines Association Soon

 

 

The School of Mines cabinet, com-
posed of representatives from each of
the departments, conducted its regu-
lar weekly meeting on Friday at 12:30
o’clock.

The major part of the discussion
was given to reports on the success
of the proposed mining association.

The oﬂicers of the cabinet are:
president, George Hurlston, ’35; vice
president, Jack Hanna, '35; secretary,
E. L. Thompson, '35; and treasurer,
Louis Linsley, '35.

The realization of every freshman’s
idea of a swell time ended yesterday
morning at 2 o’clock. Fraternity
rushing has ended and the campus
will now quiet down until the new
semester in February.

The News, at this time each semes-
ter, publishes a forecast of fraternity
rushing as predicted by the office of
pthe dean of men. A sealed envelope
was received by the News two days
before the start of rushing period.
Thepacket contained the following
statement by Mr. N. Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men and fra-
ternity adviser, who is making a pre-
diction fer the ﬁrst time:

‘‘I am making this forecast purely as
a, guess, without any ﬁgures or refer-
ences as a basis. I expect that 440
men will be bid today, receiving 670
bids, and that 160 of-the‘ 440 men bid
will accept.”

Mr. Theodore W. Biddle, present as-
sistant dean of men, has until now
made the forecasts. These forecasts
were made before the start of rushing
period and were not based upon any

For New Deal

The YMCA “l3onecrusliers,” a group
of ambitious gridders from the Y hut,
challenged the Pitt Panther and the
Pitt News today to a football game
and emphasized the fact that they
wanted a new deal.

“No professionals allowed,” ex-
claimed VVinston “Wi.ldman” McCon-
key, reputed brains of the “Boiiecrusli-
ers.” “Tell those Panther and News

average for the past two years has
been about .765, which is better than
half right. Mr. Seidle, however, has
taken over Mr, Biddle’s job of assist-

Bureau Reports
Business Decline

Pittsburgh District Shows Gains
Despite General Drop

According to the latest report pub-
lished by the Bureau of Business Re-
search, business throughout the coun-
try showed a continued drop through
August and the ﬁrst half of Septem-
ber. Although the drop was most

pronounced in the iron and steel trade,
it was also apparent in the other
heavy industries.

In the Pittsburgh district, employ-
ment, although still greatly under that
of 1929, showed by the combined pay-
rolls of the district a greater num-
ber of workers in each of the last six
months than in any month. since De-
cember, 1931. It also exceeded those
in the same period of 1933 by nearly
39 per cent. Of all the industries of
the Pittsburgh area, only three re-

ported a smaller payroll since Jul'S’r”

and all the others showed an increase.
Total working hours for the ﬁrst
eight months were 16 per cent higher
than those of the same period last
year.

Nationally, the total volume of re-
tail trade showed a slight gain over
that of last year. W'hi1e private
ﬁnancing gave evidence of no signs
of increase, the Federal agencies con-
tinued to lend large sums. Stocks and
bonds moving slowly until the middle
of September suddenly rose strongly.
Wholesale prices, farm products and
foods also increased in price.

Dr. McKay Describes
Realty Tax Relief Plan

Dr. Marion K. McKay, head of the
department of economics, was back on
the campus today, after describing
his six—point plan to relieve taxes on
real «state at the Harrisburg public
school convention.

Two of the points in the plan listed
Dy Dr. McKay, of great interest to
educators, were the assumption of a
major share of the expense of educa-
tion. by the state, and consolidation
and elimination of governmental units
including school districts.

‘Coinmenting upon. the possibility of
laying new taxes, Dr. McKay said,
“’l‘he most promising of the possible
new taxes is that of a levy upon in-
come. A flat tax probably will stand
the constitutional test but the Consti-
tution should be amended soon to pro-
vide for a levy through progressive
rates upon incomes and inlieritances.
The sales tax is undesirable, and
._lOlll(l not be used except as a last
resort.” ’ I

Foundation Study
Raps Newspapers

Articles Flaying Local Schools
Branded “ Irresponsible’ ’

Blasting articles attacking Pennsyl-
vania colleges which took part in the
recent school study as “irresponsible
journalism,” the Carnegie Foundation
pleaded .for fairer consideration of

the aims of the study in a special
statement to the University Satur-
day.

The statement, signed by W. S.

Learned, director of the Pennsylvania
study, blamed newspapers in Penn
sylvania and elsewhere for <-arryiiig
news and editorial comment of 
“scurrilous” sort, reﬁecting on the
colleges which participated in the
study. Mr. Leonard said:

‘‘In order to avoid unwarranted in-

ferences as to the Founda.tion’s re-
sponsibility for stories of this kind, I
am enclosing a bri'ef’statement of the
facts as they concern the Founda-
,tion.”
‘ Mr, Learned denied the article by
,John R. Tunis, published -in the Sep-
,tember issue of Scribner’s, which
“drew invidious distinctions between
Pennsylvania colleges and other
American institutions.”

He explained that the article ex-
pressly labeled the conditions as
“characterstic"~‘ in the entire American
system of educational administration.

Commenting on the “scandalous
epitliets” sensatienalized by newspa-
pers, Mr. L-earned declared:

“It is unlikely that when the facts
are known, intelligent readers will be
troubled by journalism of this irre-
sponsible character.”

Mr_ Tunis. in his article, raised the
question of
leges were “diploma mills,” turning
out graduates with no thought of
their individual development

 

All But Blonde React
Violently To Snake
Around Aim

Every one of the students who were
subjected to test experiments in the
psychology laboratory 107 class con-
ducted by Dr. Norman L. Munn, as-
sistant professor of psychology, re-
acted violently. That is, everyone did
except one young blonde.

An apparatus connected to the sub-
ject for experiment measured the emo-
tional reactions to a. snake winding
around the subject’s arm, a foul odor
thrust under his nose, several strong
electric shocks, a threat to pour niei'-
cury down his back, and a shot of a
revolver after an exciting story had
been told.

In all cases, except one, these re-
actions were the sanie. The blood
pressure went up, the pulse beat more
rapidly, a. gasp stopped the breathing,
the electrical resistance of the skin
decreased, and the volume of the arm
increased.

The snake used in the experiment
was borrowed from the zoology stock-
room in the basement of the Cathe-
dral.

The first project sponsored by the
Assembly this year met with hearten-
ing success Friday afternoon when a
special committee. under Jules Green,
C35, put over the season’s ﬁrst foot-
ball pep rally. Joe E, Brown, gape-
jawed comedian of Hollywood and
adopted son of the University, was
present to instill “sock-it-to-’em” atti-
tude into the students, in prepara-
tlon for Saturdays Southern Califor-
nia game.

Perhaps the most successful fea-
ture of the program was one Dr. Lu-
dovic “Strangler” Fleishacker, previ-
ously described as captain of South-
ern Ca,l’s 1915 grid squad. The
“Strangler” actually turned out to be
Pittsburgh’s own Luke Barnett, famed
entertainer and impersonator.

The hoax was not uncovered until
after Barnett, posing as a loyal Tro-
jan rooter, had worked a balcony full
of dental students into a lynch thirsty
mob. by treating the University’s grid
prospects disparagingly.

Also on Friday’s program were Dr.
John Bain “Jock” Sutherland football

coach; Bill Kern. assistant coach, who
had been scouting Southern Califor-
nia; Green; Marks; VVi1lia.in B-rinker,

Action Aplenty

HALK UP one’ more accomplish-

ment for SFA. The Pep assembly
Friday proved that this year we have
a student government association that
can accomplish things well and effi-
ciently. The assembly was well man-
aged, the program was more than sat-

' isfying, and gave evidence that SFA
- could and would sponsor school spirit
.in a way that can bring no adverse
. criticism.

The fact that the Executive com-

'mittee of SFA has planned weekly

meetings shows that the organiza-
tion has a unity of thought and pur-
pose. Meeting weekly, the organiza-
tion will be in a position to dispose
of business rapidly, and to diagnose
and act upon student opinion when
action is still timely.

A new departure in the choice of
dance chairmen was inaugurated with
the establishment of an Appointments
committee. This committee took the
brunt of the work from the Execu-
tive committee by interviewing all
applicants, narrowing that list down
to three names, and presenting those
names to the Executive committee for
The entire procedure
was completed between Friday and
Tuesday. This is record-breaking

-timelfor so ticklish a matter as the

appointment of a dance chairman.
Announcement is made today of the
appointment of an Organization com-
mittee which will take over the work
of last year’s student relations group
of Cou.ncil. The body will be the
final authority 011 organizations‘ on
campus. To begin with, it will serve
as a clearinghouse through which the
charters of all organizations on cam-
pus can be checked. It will investi-
gate the function of these groups on
campus, and make recommendations
regarding the organizations. Now
that a compact, permanently organ-

'ized committee has undertaken this
'work, we should see better organized,

more eflicient, and more practical or-
ganizations on the campus.

Within a few weeks of school, a
few of those weeks lost because of
the need for completing the personnel
of SFA, that body has shown itself
to be better organized, more capable

-of serving the student body in gen-

eral, and more willing to apply its
capabilities than any of its predeces-

Panhellenic council, in a recent pub-

sons for using the deferred rushing
plan on the campus
1. To safeguard
standards:
By lessening the number of
students who enter the Uni-
versity for purely social
reasons.
By’ putting the» first em-
phasis upon the academic
side of University life.
By reducing the complexity
of orientation of freshmen
to University life at the be-
ginning of the year.
2. To dignity the individual fra-
ternity: _
by giving them ‘an opportu-
nity to base invitation to
membership on real ac-
quaintance or friendship,
rather than on ﬁrst appear-
ance.
By safeguarding a frater-
nity from having pledges

Book Exchange Posies

The book exchange operated by
VVSGA has moved its hea.dqua1‘ters to
Heinz ‘House, where book-seeking
students may make their way and
swell the total of 500 books which
have gone through the exchange this
semester, according to the committee
chairman, This number is particular-
ly high when there is taken into con-
sideration the rapidity witli ,whi-ch
professors changed text-books in their-
courses tbis year. According to mem-
bers of the committee, the most fre-
quently heard lament in the book ex
change vicinity dealt with the fact
that so many teachers had changed
course book requirements that not
one book listed in the ﬁles was of use-.
to them.

An undertaking such as this one,
which offered to students an oppor-
tunity to secure used text books with-
out the cut-in that ’well-p:-.1tronize;l
second hand book dealers in the vi
cinity demand; which was run entire-
ly by students; and which existed
with no other motive in mind than
that of service to the student body
deserves more than just a few edito-
rial posies.

Mortar Board’s attempts last year
to establish a second-hand bookstore
for students was frustrated by an-
nouncements from the University
book store that it maintained a used
exchange where students might list
their used books for sale. Mortar
Board dropped its project and voted
instead to aid the book store in being
of real aid to students. But with a
year’s watchful waiting, we ﬁnd the
book store no more efficient and satis-
fying in supplying used books cheap
than that store was then.

The plan of VVSGA, in setting up a
student-managed exchange is the clos

at that Pitt has come to supplying:
the needs of students who ﬁnd it im
possible to buy new books for each
course. The two-ﬁle system, inaugu-
ated by the committee, should be
enlarged so as to be of service to the
entire University. An eﬁort should
be made for permanent headquarters
for the exchange as the congestion
around the ﬁles proved that more

room is needed. A room should be

set aside for the exchange where stu-
dents may bring the books and save
the confusion and loss of time that re-l
sults from the present system where-
by students must get in touch by tele-
phone with the owners. The exchange
should be so centrally located that
students in schools other than the
College, Education, and Business Ar‘-
ministration might buy and sell books
through its media.

Thinking it Over

Somebody’s Mother
It was nearly 3 o’clock in the morning when we felt our way]
down a. ﬂight of wooden stairs that fronted on the lake beach. Our

feet sank into the sand, and I scooped up a handful of it.
The air swept cold and swift on our faces.

Vie saw the orange ﬂare of

It was

a ﬁre ahead along the shore and

ran over. In the ﬂickering light we made out a woman in a bathing
suit and a pair of white ducks, a girl in a dress, and a little boy.

The woman had bleached

hair, and her face was very red and
leathery. The girl looked heavy but
pleasant. We forgot about the boy.

“Hello,” we said.

“Hello,” said the woman friendily.
“Need a camp ﬁre? You can have
ours. We’re leaving.” .

“Thanks. This looks like a good
place to go to sleep beside,” Jake
said, and we laughed.

“What, don't you boys have a cot-
tage?”

“Naw, we just got in from Pitts-

burgh. lVe’ll have to sleep on the
beach or somewhere.” This from
Brooks.

The woman’s eyes glistened. Her
face was funny in the light.

“Oh, you poor boys. -‘I’m so sorry"
for you. If we had» any room, I’d be
glad to let you sleep at our place."
She hesitated. “I’m' a mother," you
know.” .

“Somebody’s mother, boys,”
suggested. \Ve skipped it.

“Got any more wood?” I said.

“No, we got those pieces from the
owner of our cottage. Oh, you poor
boys. I lost a boy myself, you know.
Just nineteen.”

VVe didn’t say anything. They left.

“-Screwy ol’ gal,” said Jake, “V/Vell,

“The question,” I said, “is where tlr

A Dog and a Man

Joe was planting beans in the back
garden. The Wurzels were having
their garage built, and a stolid laborer
with bowed shoulders was scraping
the yellow clay sides of the founda-
tion smooth.

Joe kept dropping beans into the
damp brown rows until the sheet of
sunlight on his shirt back burned and
his hips began to ache. Then be
straightened up, stretched his should-
ers, and swung his arms.‘ He noticed
that the workman was watching him
as he spat into his hands.

“Got a garden?” Joe asked cheer-
fully. -

The man did have a voice. “Ain't
got nott’n’,” he grunted pleasantly.
He studied the callouses on his palms,
“Dat your dog—dcre?” He waved to-
ward the Martins’ green frame garage
on the other side of the garden. ~

Joe turned and tried to-discover a
dog in the shadow. The tiny ball of
gray lying on the man’s frayed black
coat, he made out, was the creature
the fellow wanted to know about.
The dog’s muzzle was huddled be-
tween its paws, and its eyes were
shut. , . '

“No, we haven’t got a dog. Where
did you ﬁnd him?’:

“Lilla dog, he sleep alla night on
da grass, over dere.” He pointed his
shovel at the long grass bordering the
cinder alley. “I ﬁnd heem ’bout seex-
tirty dis morning. I geeve heem some
meelk. He follow me alla time. He
weel not leave me.”

The man seemed to want to con-
vince J‘oe, for he went over to the
dog, clicked his tongue, and started to
walk away_ The scrawny thing
sprang up and trotted after him.

The laborer chuckled. He picked
up the dog, laid it back on his coat,
and started his scraping again. With
his foreﬁnger, Joe slowly stirred the
swollen beans ﬁoating in the water of
his tin cup. .

It Doesn't Pay

The University of Chicago permits
students in the humanities curriculum
to bring with them to ﬁnal examina-
tions any texts, notebooks or refer-
ence material they choose. The the-
ory seems to be that unless the stu-
dent knows something of the course
he cannot “crib” enough in the al-
loted time to raise his grade much.

Hobos Get Their Way

Every stratum ofsociety has its
ghobos, A hobo is one who gets his
~'way_ He cares nothing for anybod
else—even another hobo. . -.

Among the so-called brain—trusters
or, more accurately, persons with
some social point of view in Wasl1ing-

for hobos. Especially is this true in

_ Of course the FERA has a plan in
loperation whereby homeless men are
feared for. It also includes profes-
§sional hobos. But these are not the
Ehobos for whom there is this sharp

[deal of love and respect for the wan-

lthe FERA (Federal Emergency Relief.

lfew weeks ago I talked to a friend in

ll-Vashington who has a distinct social
lphilosophy and tries to run one of
}FERA’s divisions witli it as his guid-
§ ing force, making million dollar trans-
Eactions daily or semi-daily.
“ FERA bought dollars and dollars’
worth of drought—area cattle, canning
much of the meat for this winter's
unemployed, and storing the hides.
The government has a heavy invest-
ment in these hides bearing a costly
lintérest. And much money has to be
spent for shoes for the unemployed.
The government's debt is running
high, the cost of unemployment relief
is driving it toward drastic inﬂation,
and the unemployed are getting but
one-fourth of the shoes they need. A
vicious problem, I would say.
However, these brain—trusters are
not without ideas as to how to solve
such .1 problem. They ‘simply pro-
posed that the FERA put unemployed
to work in now idle tanneries, pay
them a normal wage, and distribute
the leather to idle shoe factories,
worked by unemployed at a normal
wage, to distribute the shoes to the
unemployed. Even members of Pitt’s

economics faculty would object to
that plan.

And objection there was.’ The
NValker-Johnson building?‘ w-h_ic1i

houses the FERA in lvashington, was
inundated with telegrams, phone calls,
and personal visits of many hobos—
the type of hobos for whom there is
a great deal of contempt. Hobos
like the wandering ones, with little
regard if any for the country’s gen-
eral welfare. '

j A conference was held between
some shoe manufacturers and FERA
officials. The manufacturers did not

cause it would hurt their business
(they may have said so -in public
statements but not in that confer-
ence). The plan, of--course, would
not hurt private business as FERA
proposed to maintain its normal or-
ders from private business for shoes
to be given to the unemployed.

, The hobos objected for one reason
(in‘the conference) to the plan that
would take some unemployed off re-
lief, give them wages to buy goods
they can not now buy from private
business, and give the unemployed
shoes without decreasing employment
in private business or the total vol-
ume of-shoe business done privately.
The hobos objected to setting the pre-
cedent.

And Bernie Barucl1’s kind (who
have much to say in the running of
the government), and perhaps himself
personally, I don’t know, but his kind
anyway are rigging the market on
hides this year.

By Raymond Pearlman

I received a rather unusual letter
from a friend of mine studying at the-
University of ‘Chicago. Recently I
chided him for his utter lack of ad-
justment to his fellow students He
is a type found on practically every
campus. You all know the kind-the
fellow who is berated as an intellect-
ual snob when in reality he is the only
“swell guy" at the university. He
writes the old line_

“You say that I lack adjustment.-
VVell, you’re all wrong. VVhy should
I adjust mself to anyone? And then
it’ I do, to whom? Should I adjust my-
self to these vulgar boors strutting
like pompous asses from one end of
the campus to another? No, I am
wrong. There is one part of the
campus they seem not to know, or
perhaps have no desire to know: Lake
Michigan, my rendezvous. Never have
I seen the waterfront of-this gorgeous
lake as frequented as the Commons
or the bridge-rooms, The simple pleas-
upre of lying on the rocks smoking a
pipe and watching the waves roll in

not appeal to them I once suggested
to the University they give a- course.
in the “Appreciation of Lake Michi-
gan and Jackson park” and they
laughed at me. I wept and pitied
them . . .

“So where is your sympathy for
me‘? W’asn’t it Aristotle who first ele-
vated sympathy as one of the cordial
virtues of a human being? He states
somewhere in his “Ethics” that man is
distinguished from the beast chieﬂy
by his virtue. Sympathy‘ does not i1n--
ply altruism, rather it implies an in-
terest in,. an understanding of, our
fellow beings. The fullest self-realized
tion of man cannot blossom from a
purely cgoistic root; it is directly
nourished by understanding and sym-
pathy for the complex personality of
others.

“You judge me from an egoistic cri-
terion, and conclude that I am warped
in my mental tastes because my de-
sires do not coincide with yours. Ah,
could you but live my mental life for
ﬁve minutes, you would discover a.
world hitherto unknown to you, nay
not even suspected by you. How can
you understand me when I tell you

that perhaps I seek something unat-
tainable? How tragic to be drunk
with a passionate yearning for beauty!
-—the paragon of beauty for which Os-
car Vvilde strove. I recall that ex-
quisite paragraph of his:

“ ‘I believe that if one man were to
live out his life fully and completely,
were to give form to every feeling, ex-
pression to every thought, reality to
every dream—I believe that the world
would gain such a fresh impulse of.
joy that we would forget all the main-
dies of medievalism. and return to
the Hellenic ideal, to something Jiner
and richer than the Hellenic ideal.’
And then further he continues:

“ ‘Beauty is a form of genius, is
higher indeed than genius as it needs
no interpretation. It is of the great
facts of the’ world, like sunlight, or
springtime, or the reflection in dark
waters of that silver shell we call

l
l Lamp Post

lrteé-e:¢C

By Wilbur Clark.
Morsels and Hangnails

One of the easiest mistakes than can
be made in a newspaper, one of the
most difficult to detect,. one of the
most frequent, and one which occa-
sions more invectives than most oth-
ers is the misspelling of names.

“Wilbur,” ah, that is bad enough,
but have it spelled “Wiber.” ’tis too
much; I kinna “ber” it_ Which, I ad-
mit, is much worse than even the
worst pulled by those two putrid
punsters peerless, Charles W’. L. Fore-
man, Jr., and Omer E. Kronenwetter.

“So they cut down the old lamp
posts

“And hauled them away to the
mill—or somewhere.”

Possibly with the intent of improv-
ing the morals of Pittsburgh's youth,
the old gas lamps which glowed yel-
low in Highland park have been re-
placed by bright street lights placed
high above the trees on ugly iron
poles.

The passing of the park's gas lamps
is regretted by many. They were
some of the’ more charming things
about Highland park. Those who did
not care for the smell of the monkey
house found pleasure in the quaint,
old-fashioned lamps and the lamp
lighter who leaned his ladder against
the gray posts at dusk each evening.
It was almost Old Worldish.

One could, in other days, walk
around the reservoir at night and
look out where the lights of towns

along the river floated on the black

lake of the valley, Now, the lights on
their posts above the trees that line
the road which winds up to “the
Knob” shine in one’s eyes so that the
stars are dimmed.

If the lights were placed to discour-
age parking, they seem not to serve
their purpose, for it is quite dark un-
der the trees, as many of you know.

 

Queer, what pranks oue’s mind will
play. The other day, walking and
smoking along the walk back of
Alumni hall, and meditating on the
comparative worth of cigarettes a11d
briars, was considerably startled to
see a Freshman co-ed put to her
painted lips the stem of a pipe. That
is, I was sure it was a pipe until she
took away the hand which cupped the
bowl and I saw that it was a fountain
pen. .

pass from Warburton to Clemens gave
the latter a chance to squeeze over
the goal line very close to the side
stripes. Southern Cal’s kick was
blocked, making the score at the half,
13-6.

After Haskell Wotkyns contributed
two war dances through the Pitt line
for ﬁrst downs soon after the second!
half began, the Southern Cal attack
bogged down and a half-blocked punt
gave the Panthers the ball on U.S.C's
35_ It was a matter of seconds until
Randour ran back to toss a pass far
down the field to his left. Cotton
Warburton was in that general direc-
tion but Verne Baxter came right
along to snatch the ball from under
the Cotton’s nose while running at
full speed. Weinstock again made the
extra point. The scoring pencils
ceased marking then and there.

Commenting upon the game, the de-
feated coach, Howard Jones said:
“We were beaten by a better team.
Pitt looked very good and if they stay
that way they are going to go places."

Sutherland’s statement after the
game was: “I have nothing but
praise for the playing today of Shot-
well, Ormiston and Baxter.”

One thing which marred the game
was the slowness and uncertainty with
which the oﬂicials handled it. In fact,
it soon reached a point where every-
one on the ﬁeld was anxious to make
the decisions except the_ofﬁcials.

A between-the-halves feature, a
game played by the junior teams of
Arnold and Shadyside schools, pro-
duced many laughs but no touch-
downs. The little fellows seemed to
have just too much room down. there
on the ﬁeld and didn’t seem to be
able to get over_ much of it at one
time_

I Stadium Sidelights I

Something: new to followers of football in
Pittsburgh was offered by the sun-visors worn
by the men of the Southern California bench.
The constant glare of the sun, which shines
every day out there (according to a native
sun) makes it advisable for the men on the
bench to wear the visors to avoid eye strain.
Someone with a ﬂare for humor suggested
that sun-goggles would be much more effec-
tive. but the native sun replied that this
year's Trojans weren't ﬂashy enough to
hard on the eyes.

It nu

Julius Bescos, captain and right end of
the Trojans, who sustained a leg injury in the
ﬁnal quarter and had to be carried oﬁ the
ﬁeld, was seen walking out of the stadium
under his own power after the game. While
he walked with a pronounced limp, it was
evident that no serious injury had come to
Bescos, as was at first feared.

for Pitt to have a. cracker-jack rooting sec-

Health Standard
For 240 Women
Lower This Year

Higher Percentage In ‘A’ Group;
34 Rate ‘B;’ 14 in ‘C’ List;
Checks Athletic Activity

 

 

Freshman women this year are
rather a healthy lot according to.the
results of the physical examinations
given by Dr, Auleene M. Jamison of
the Student Health service to 240
women students who entered the Uni-
versity this fall.

Upon examination, the girls are di-
vided into groups A, B, and C. 3-CC0_1‘§'
ing to their physical ability to partici-
pate in physical education. Of the
total number examined, 40 were placed
in the A group, 34 in the B group and
14 in the C report group. Those in
the C report group are excused from
all gymnasium work and are required
only to report to Dr. Jamison’s oﬂice
at regular intervals for a rest period
and to do certain required readings
in health subjects. In the unre-
stricted A group, those qualifying are
permitted to take part in any sport
offered by the department.

Although not all of the women have
completed their examinations the re-
sults thus far show the general stand-
ard of health to be slightly lower than
that of last year.

Any students who have not yet
taken their examinations are request-
ed to make appointments with Dr.
Jamison during this week.

Popeye is not the only spinach
ﬁend——the guinea pigs in the Thaw

chemistry department is using the
pigs in experimental work, and an iin-

handfuls of spinach.

Dr. C. G. King, professor of cheni-

with other processes in the body.
Spinach, which abounds in vitamin C,

“A man without sex appeal should
