a'According to reports, there will

c three balloting places on the
Oakland campus: the Cathedral,
Benedum Hall and Scaife Hall.
The polls will open at 9 a.m.' and
close at 9 p.m.

The counting for the ﬁrst election
will be done in the Student Union’s
Kurtzman Room at 3 p.m. on
March 11. The ballots from branch
campuses will be tabulated with
those from the Oakland campus.

The four units of faculty voting
will follow the recent decision
handed down by the State Labor
Board. Those units are the schools
under the Provost's area except the
Medical School, Law School and
Graduate Schools of Public Health,
which will have their own elections
the same day.

 “Fire" nuisance

l

The Dental School will be
excluded from voting in this
election.

The color-coded ballots from the
various areas will list the names of
the competing unions and the entry
“No Representation.” Faculty

may choose which union will be the «

exclusive bargaining agent for their
area, or choose to appoint no union
at all.

The ballot breakdowns for the
eligible areas are as follows:

-—In the provost’s area: The
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP), the Pitt Pro-
fessional Union (PPU), the Penn-
sylvania State Education Associa-
tion (PSEA) and No Representa-
tion.

—In the Medical School: the
Faculty Association of the School of

"Medicine, the AAUP, the PSEA

and No Representation.

—In the Graduate Schools of
Public Health: the AAUP, the
PSEA and No Representation.

-—In the Law School: the Law
School Association and No Repres-
entation. -

Faculty in the Provost’s area and
Law School will use the Cathedral
and Benedum as polling places,
while faculty in the Medical School
and Graduate Schools of Public
Health will use the Scaife polling
place.

All eligible faculty on University
payrolls prior to last Thursday will
be permitted to vote.

False ﬁre alarms at Pitt are on
the increase, creating a safety and
ﬁnancial nuisance for students and
personnel, according to Health and
Safety Ofﬁcer Gene Barry.

The Health and Safety Depart-
ment receives 35-50 false alarms
every year. Barry recently noted
that from September to December
__of last year. the University
averaged almost‘ one false ﬁre
alarm a week. _ ' . -

Third SGB Election Called ,

BY BILL MOORE

Students planning to vote a
second time for Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) president found
only closed-up voting machines in
the designated polling places
yesterday because of a ruling
Monday by the Student Govern-
ment Judicial Board (SGJB).

The elections were moved to
Thursday and Friday by suggestion
of the SGJB, to allow more time for
campaigning.

The SGJ B upheld a ruling made
last week by the Student Govern-
ment Election Committee (SGEC)
to.invalidate the first presidential
election, held Jan. 121 and 227 but
recommended the postponement
after an appeal of the SGEC
decision by presidential candidate
Joe Gronsky. '

“We feel that the improprieties
which were proven to have
occurred during the election...did,
in fact, jeopardize the fairness of

‘the election,” the SGJB ruling

stated.

' SGEC chairman,Lee Mosessaid .

he was pleased the SGJB upheld
his group’s decision. “But, Iwould
have much preferred holding the
elections as scheduled,” he said.
“I’m a little disappointed,”
Gronsky:"s'aid, “but now at least I
can put all of my efforts into the

new election.”

Candidate Barry Weisband, who
ﬁled the original election contest
with the SGEC after losing by 32
votes, agreed with both ends of the
SGB ruling. “It will give the voters
more time to look at the candidates,
and it will allow for a two—day span
so more can vote," Weisband said.

Party System Failures
Uphold McCarthy Bid    

BY SUSAN MANNELLA
The need for a third-party
candidate for the presidency is
demonstrated by the record of the

more than 200 people in David
Lawrence Hall last night.

False Alarms Costly, Harmful

the alarm's location. .

The more trucks involved, the
greater the expense. Scaife Hall
requires ﬁve to six trucks per
alarm. and the Towers and Quad
residence areas require fewer.

The University has not had to
pay for any false alarms yet, Barry
said. But this could change.

There is a rumor that some
people are thinking about making
us pay." he explained. /

students caught for sending false

“In case you need to be
reminded from a practical point of
view why we need an independent
candidate,” McCarthy said, “let

me point out that the Republicans ,

gave us Nixon—and that should
take care of the next 20 years/——and
the Democrats twice had a chance
to beat Nixon and failed.”
McCarthy, a 1968 presidential
candidate and former Minnesota
senator, saidthe concept of party
loyalty is one of the drawbacks of
the two-party system because it
results in support for policies “no.
matter what the party does.” . I
As examples, he cited Demo-
cratic support for the war in

[Vietnam while a Democrat was in

the White House and the Republi-

~cans' continued support for Nixon

after it became obvious helhad
misused the presidency.

“Many of the critical issues that
confront the nation today are the
result of party action,” McCarthy
said. First, he pointed to the U.S.
approach to foreign policy, which
he said always focuses on use of
military power.

“I think it would be good to have
an inaugural address where the
president didn't point out the
military power we possess.”

The second area, McCarthy said,
encompasses the duties of the
president. “The parties allow the

president to pass responsibility to a

secretary of state or defense, or the
head of the CIA.

“I think the public should insist

the parties state before the
elections take place who will be
appointed to some of these _key
positions."
McCarthy said he was not yet
prepared to name individuals he
would appoint, but would want
someone independent of political
attorney general,
possibly an historian as secretary of
state and some nonlawyers, or at
least lawyers who had “done
something other than practice
law." on the Supreme Court.

, McCarthy also said major parties
are largely responsible for “the

election that pieces _

SGJ B at Monday's hearing center--

ed on the fact that, at the SGEC
hearing, Weisband had produced
no witnesses who said they had
wanted to vote for him but hadn’t

been able to ﬁnd his name on the ‘

voting machines.

“They have no solid grounds for
their decision,” he charged. ~
“They say the election may have
been affected, but they admit there‘
is no proof.”

Moses argued that irregularities
had occurred in the voting process,
and said it was “highly probable
the outcome may have been_
affected” by the irregularities. _

New Elevator 

Fire Safety

Code Passed A  

BY BOB COHEN

A new safety code for University,
elevators will require that all
elevators be attached with addi-

- tional safety _devices by June 1,,

1978. Implementation of the code

will cost an average of $7,500 per  

car.

The code was passed with/ah
three-year compliance clause ret-_
roactive to June 1, 1975.

The code states that all elevators,  A

that travel 25 or more feet," or stop

at three or more ﬂoors must be

equipped with “Phase One,”

which during a fire alert would _ 

cause the elevator to continue to its
destined floor, stop without open-
ing, and return to the ground ﬂoor
or most accessible area.

A Phase One will prevent elevator

tie-ups and will allow firemen to .1

get to the scene of a ﬁre as quickly
as possible. Phase One ‘ will be

initiated through smoke sensing ‘I

devices or key operation.

Director of Auxiliary Services
Tom Albert said the University
deﬁnitely will comply with the new

bill by the deadline, but no deﬁnite ,

date has been set.

The construction of the safety.
devices will take place during the
summer months to minimize
inconvenience to students.

The cost of each device will,
range from $3,000 for the newer
cars to $12,000 for the older cars in
the Cathedral, according to George

Simmons of the Physical Plant.‘ .
“The total cost will be approxi- I ,

mately $175,000 for the dormitories

alone, while the total cost for the , if
whole University may be closer to V

$1 million,” he said. -
Students will not bear the brunt
of the cost through increased
housing rates in 1977 or 1978,
Albert said.
additional funds have been propos-
ed in thelbudget with the hope that

the statewill allocate the additioni‘al_.g

"Something is wrong some-
where.” Barry said. “Some of us
who have fought ﬁres would be
more rough. We have well-
constructed buildings and a good

that some individual could be
allowed to ruin this.”

Barry said students caught
setting false alarms “should not be

_ enough trouble ﬁghting ﬁres now

and the student body should not be
deprived of any fire protection."
Residence Life Director Fred
Fonseca said a student can be
prosecuted by the University

this year and brought before the
Campus Judicial Board, according

to Fred Thieman of the University
- Judicial Ofﬁce. He said they were

given dormitory probation and told
to write letters of apology to all
involved in the ‘incident.

“A lot of the action taken nas to
do with the cooperation of the
student,” Thieman said. “If he is
uncooperative, the board is harsher
and he could be suspended from
the dormitory.”

Thieman added that Al Bowen,
the University’s coordinator of
legal services, can handle more
serious violations, such as those by
a repeated offender or injury-

if '   It seemed at ﬁrst that the, decision by the Student Government

Judicial Board (SGJB) to reject candidate Joe Gronsky’s appeal and
uphold the previous ruling of the Election Committee would end the

job.

Telection brouhaha and allow Student Government to get on with the

 The SGJB agreed that a new election must be held, but that more
, time should be given for campaigning before students traipse once
» again to the polls.

This costly delay, though superﬁcially wise will act only to the

further detriment of Student Govemment’s rapport with the students.

The extra days the presidential candidates have to talk to ‘the voters
will be sharply outweighed by the. electorateis increased ’
disillusionment over the bureaucratic bungling surrounding this year s

, election.

, l Had the election been held on schedule, the votes would’ve been in

' I last night, and Pitt students would have had a new president. But by
  postponing the balloting another day, the SGJB has increased the

chances for another damaging turnout. .
In addition to the SGJB’s prolonging the agony, the Election

‘Committee exhibited uncommon irresponsibility in marking Tuesday’s

voting machines with little more information than the fact that the
election-had been, postponed two days. Some polling places weren’t

, marked at all.

. It should have occurred to the committee that students -who came to
vote would wonder why the SGJB changed the date of the election. A

jifomial statement signed by members of the SGBJ and giving the

rationale for its decision would not have been asking too much.

Today a Lawyer, Tomorrow..

BY BILL MOORE

If all goes as planned, within
six years everybody in this country
will be either a doctor or a lawyer.

The naive masses vying for the
precious few spaces left in our_
medical schools have been around
for a while. Everyone wants to be a
doctor, and there is little to say to
the herd of premeds except
“you’re in for a shock.” '

It is the prelaw horde that is
getting out of hand. Not only do

ally, NEA (the PSEA parent) claims
1.5 million members, all elemen-
tary and secondary school teachers
with, the exception of 40,000 in
higher education, mostly commun-

contracts with four-year institu--

community colleges (some with
several campuses). AAUP repre-
sents over 70,000 members, mostly
in the four-year institutions with
prestigious graduate programs.
and has 20,000 members covered
by 28 AAUP contracts in four-year
institutions (several representing
more than one campus).

AAUP maintains a . Harrisburg

top legal staffs in Pennsylvania,

The AAUP Track Record

A A recent survey of state colleges
(where PSEA services the collec-

tive bargaining contract) show’ 3
that in about a third of the sta :-—.»,-3‘

colleges the faculty senate has
been dissolved and in another third
the senate has been weakened. On
the other hand, at Temple
University, Dr. Marvin Wachman
stated last summer that profession-
alism and collegiality have been
strengthened by the AAUP con-
tract, that the senate has far from
been destroyed, and that the
administrators and faculty have
begun to work together more
effectively because of the contract.
From a budgetary point of view,
the state colleges this year have
been required by legislative cuts to
dismiss 82 faculty without cause.
Temple, on the other hand. had
their AAUP contract implicitly
honored by the legislature (30"7

the state college 40% in five years)
and received greater increases than
non-AAUP universities in the
appropriations bill. Finally. AAUP
joined with Temple's administra-
tion in successfully lobbying for the
State to buy the financially troubled
Temple University Hospital, thus
adding another $20 million to
Temple's budget (and reducing the
need for tuitionincreases) .while
PSEA was going to court to contest
the firing of 82 state college faculty
they represent.

Those Against ’rhe Union

A group has ﬁnally surfaced to

-’ Vargue against the unionization of

the Pitt faculty. PSEA/NEA.-PITT
welcomes this for two reasons.

First, we discover who the faculty
are that oppose unionization. It is
very enlightening to peruse the
sponsors of the Teachers for an
Independent Faculty. The names
appearing on the ﬁrst mailing of
the TIF show the group to be heavy
with Chairpersons, Mellon Profes-
sors, full professors, and the
tenured in general—exact1y those
who would be expected to be
satisﬁed with the status quo
because they are already wel1-fa-

{$3/ored by the administration, near

I‘ >iétirement, or whatever.

Many of
those may feel that they have good
selﬁsh reasons to oppose any
union. For‘ example, one can
understand why members of the
Department of Philosophy are well
represented in the TIF. Divide and
rule is an old tactic and the
administration at Pitt is well aware
of its many subtle possibilities.
The second reason PSEA wel-
comes the surfacing of the TIF is
that this should make it easier to
clarify the issues involved in
unionization as TIF serves as a
vehicle for the expression of the
many» misconceptions involved in

' faculty unionization. ' —

In his article in The Pitt News of
1976, Edward Arnett,

‘number of misunderstandings

about collective bargaining. First,
he avers that unionization will lead
to an adversary relationship be-
tween faculty and administration.
Such _is by no means necessary
unless either» side desires it.
Rather, collective bargaining is a
mechanism for the solution of
mutual problems between faculty
and administration. These pro-
blems include University gover-
nance. adequate salaries, and
Harrisburg relations. The Univer-

mechanism forlthis, and no
alternative exists. It is possible

that there will be an increase in the ’

temperature of the rhetoric after
the faculty unionizes, but we all
prefer discussion between equals
to “yessir" and “nosir.”

He raises the question of outside
organizationshaving vested inter-
ests in achieving unionization—as

if the administration does _not have
a vested Interest In maintaining the

status quo—as if the TIF does not
have a vested interest in the status
quo. He correctly perceives that
unionization will mean a redistri-
bution of power at the university,
but incorrectly assumes that the
power will shift from the adminis-
tration to the “outside organiza-
tion.” Rather, it will mean a shift
in power from the administration
and trustees to the faculty. Every
faculty member who does not fancy
himself a future dean or chancellor
will welcome this. The “outside
organization” will simply provide
services to the Pitt faculty such as
negotiating skill and legal advice.
lvfany are beginning to see that the
real choice among the agents is
which one will provide the best
service. It is absurd to think that

any outside agent would be able to '

thwart the wishes of the Pitt
faculty.

He raises the spectre of another
bureaucracy. There ‘will be another

one, but the point is that it will be
our bureaucracy. We need a new
structure to meet new challenges to
traditional faculty prerogatives.
Further, his conception of how this
structure will work is hopelessly
misinformed. He assumes that the
union will be making decisions on
hiring and promotion, and that this
process will somehow become
quantiﬁed according to number of
publications and the like. Actually,
the function of the union is to
assure that procedures are esta-
blished that involve faculty partici-
pation in such decisions on the
time-honored basis of collegiality.
Only when these break down does
the union become involved.

The function of the union is to
guarantee due process. The union
does not interfere in any way with
the considerations that enter "into
the decision as long as the
established process is followed.
Where has Arnett ever heard of a
union steward at a University? His
criticisms of what happens when a
faculty _unionizes are based on
fantasy. Instead of conﬁning his
reading on the merits of unioniza-

tion to Public Law 195, I suggest he‘

examine the effects of unionizing
on those institutions in Pennsyl-
vania, and elsewhere, that have
already unionized. Faculty partici-
pation in governance has been
strengthened. Due process has

-by professional staffs.

weldnesday-,-uievifirrﬁaryg§,*.l.976i3 .

been guaranteed. _

Arnett ‘refers to “expensive
promotional literature” prepared
This is an
obvious reference to the
PSEA/NEA-PITT’s “lnterim
Statement of Policy and Goals”
because the lack of resources and

‘staff of the other groups has

reduced them to mailing out
mimeographed materials. His
statement is without proof and
completely contrary to fact.
Virtually every word of this
statement was written by faculty
and professional employees of the
University of Pittsburgh and not by
our own PSEA staff. As a matter of
fact, those who prepared this
statement did so on their own time
and, in some cases, at the risk of
disapproval of their supervisors.
On the other hand, the TIF can
argue their position, safe in the
knowledge that those who watch
over our shoulders are well-pleased

with their efforts. It involves risk to .

work for the_union. I could name
many . people who support the
PSEA but, rightly, or wrongly, are
afraid to come out front.

This letter is not the place to
answer all the issues he raises in
his last paragraph. .I suggest he
read the PSEA literature carefully.
But, briefly, the quality of the
University will obviously be im-
proved when salaries are competi-
tive with other top institutions, and
with the other professional oppor-
tunities open to faculty members,
so that we can attract and hold top
faculty.

domicile as his parents, unless he
"proves himself ﬁnancially indepen-
dent of parents. Students attempt-
ing to gain state residency may not
be receiving aid from another state.

Pennsylvania residents now pay
$570 per term. Out-of-state stu-
dents pay $1,140.

The status of all out-of-state
students is based on’ a question-
naire-. Presently eight percent of
the student body is composed of
out-of-state students. Usually 500-
600 questionnaires are distributed
to incoming students each year.

If a student feels the decision
denying him Pennsylvania resident

the Residency Appeals Committee.
The Committee is comprised ofone
middle-to-upper level University
administrator from each of five
areas: Student Affairs, Business,

A decision on the residency
status of each student is facilitated
by obtaining proof of intended

is made as soon as possible. The
Committee meets twice in fall and
once each summer and winter.

Students can attain information
regarding residency information
from thevUniversity Bulletins and
from current ﬁnancial statements
in addition to the letters and

Eyes Have I t for Premeds

BY KEN MINARIK

This year fewer than 40% of
Pitt's premeds will get into medical
school, according to information
published by Alpha Epsilon Delta,
Pitt's premed honor society. The
remainder will be forced to
consider alternatives to medicine.

such as dentistry, osteopathy,
public health or clinical psycho-
logy.

While many graduate schools are
suffering from a ﬂood of eligible
applicants, at least one of the allied
health professions is being helped
by the “premed mania” sweeping
the country.

Once considered a “second-rate
alternative" by many premeds,
optometry is in its ﬁnest hour. For

the first time, it's attracting
thousands of highly qualified
applicants.

An optometrist is a health-care
professional educated. trained and
state-licensed to examine, diag-
nose and treat conditions of the
vision system.

According to the American

‘Optometric Association (AOA),

opportunities for future optome-
trists are excellent.

The increased demand for vision
care has resulted not only from
population growth, says the AOA,
but also from an “increased
understanding of how good vision
relates to driving. industrial
production, student achievement,
adjustment to aging, and other
crucial areas of modern society.”

Optometry schools are now able
to graduate only enough optome-
trists to replace those who have

‘died or retired, but by 1990 an

estimated 28,000 additional opto-
metrists will be needed. The_re--
fore, new optometry schools

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different lQs, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent
educator. Practically all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.

Think for a moment what that means. All of them—even the slowest—now read
an average novel in less than two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
more, and enjoy more than when they read slowly. That's right! They
understand more. They remember more. They enjoy more. You can do the same

are opening and others are being
planned.

Despite popular belief. optome-
trists are more than lens grinders.
They examine the eyes and related
in search of vision
problems, eye diseases and other
abnormalities. They gather infor-
mation on the vision system during
optometric examinations, diagnose
conditions and prescribe glasses,
contact lenses and vision therapy,
among other things. “

Doctors of optometry practice in
virtually every community in the
country. notes the'AOA, and they
don't need part-time jobs to keep
from starving.

The first-year mean net income
for optometrists is estimated at
$15.000. and after a few years of
practice, the estimated mean net

 income rises to $33,000 annually. .

Optometrists rank third of 48
occupations on the basis of most
rapid advancement in the median
income. according to the U.S.
Census Bureau. (Professional ath-
letes and veterinarians rank first
and second, respectively.)

To be considered for admission
to an optometry school. a student
must complete at least two years of
college courses. Though that's the
minimum required for admission,
the AOA emphasizes that most
students entering optometry
schools‘ have earned four-year
bachelor of science degrees.

Applicants to optometry schools
also are required to take the
Test which is given at Pitt three
times annually.

So don't despair when you get
your rejection from Johns Hopkins.

Coed Floor

‘It’s Not What We Thought’

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

It’s not unusual to ﬁnd 30 or 40
residents of 10th floor (MCNR)
gathered in the halls at 11 p.m.
cariying on one big conversation.
The residents of MCNR’s first coed
floor get along well together,
better, they say, than all-male or
all-female floors.

“It-'s deceptive to say we get
along well because the floor is
coed, though,” said 10th floor

“I think the-personalities of the

Hudson agrees. “I moved up here

because the floor was coed,” he

said.

‘‘I honestly think girls are

cleaner than men. And this ﬂoor’s.
a lot quieter than any all-male floor
I’ve seen."

Most of the new residents of 10th
floor, though, say they "didn’t move
in because the floor was coed.

all-male or all-female floors.

“I just wanted to live in MCNR,”
said third-year pharmacy student
Greg George. “I’d have lived
anywhere there was space.”

And there was alot of space on
the 10th floor last fall when it
became coed. Most oflast year’s 55
female residents moved out,

several because they would not,

stay under the new arrangement.

Senior nursing student- Sharon
Heasley was one of last year’s
residents who stayed. I

“Even though we decided to
retain our rooms, some of us didn’t
like the idea of men on the floor,”
Heasley said. “We thought it

would be one big party all term.»

But fairly early in the year we
found we were wrong.

“The floor’s quieter and friend-
lier this year than it was as an
all-female floor.” ,

Regardless of -why they moved
in, though, 10th floor residents are
pleased with the set up.

,“If someone on the floor is
unhappy, they haven’t told me,”
Abromitis said.

“It’s wonderful here compared -

to my old floor in Tower A," said
third-year pharmacy student Vince

violent there at times.”

Most floor residents think being
coed makes people more consid-
erate and more friendly.

Junior biology major Yolanda
Bruce, who lived on the 10th when
the ﬂoor was all female, thinks this
year’s residents are friendlier.

“When you’re dealing with all,
women," Bruce said, “most of
them like to keep to themselves.
With men, the ﬂoor‘s more ope

“And it’s definitely more realist-
ic than segregated ﬂoors,” Abro-
mitis said. “After all, we’re not
going to be living with men all our

It did take a while for residents to
get acquainted, though. With the
east wing occupied by women, the
west wing by men, and the main
hall mixed, not everyone mingled
right away.

“The first ﬂoor-meeting was

pretty sad,” Abromitis said.
“White girls sat‘ in one corner,
black girls in another, with white
and black men occupying the other
two.” -

“We were kind of feeling our
way at ﬁrst,” Bruce said. “We had

-to work harder to bring everyone

together, to ﬁnd things men and
women could get together on.”
The floor is together now and
liable to remain so next year,’ as
most residents indicate they will
retain their rooms in March’s

drawings. But ‘there are a few
problems to work out.

“A lot of people make an
unnecessary big deal out of the
floor," Hudson said.

that at all.

“It’s just a nice, relaxed floor

Yolanda Bruce thinks the ﬂoor
should be run better administra-
tively. “There are too many

‘‘If there were going to be _rules

sci-ti feature and television pilot
about Earth in the year 2133 after a
great conflict had destroyed all but
a few remnants of modern
civilization. Other television movie
pilots recently included Planet
Earth and The Questor Tapes.

A future Roddenberry project is

a feature-ﬁlm version of Star Trek.
Production. will begin in July,
Roddenberry said.
’ He said the movie will be
produced in quadra-sound, similar
to the movie Earthquake, and it will
be released sometime this year.
Projected television endeavors are
The Tribune, a police series, and
,Spectre,.a series dealing with the
supernatural.

As his success as a writer builds,
it is interesting to note that writing
is Roddenberry’s third “career.”
His ﬁrst, as a professional pilot,
began during World War II when
"he ﬂew B-17s in the South Paciﬁc.

Later Roddenberry worked for
Pan Am. He recounted his
experiences as crewman in a plane
crash in the“Syrian desert which
killed more than 40 people.
Roddenberry ultimately received a
Civil Aeronautics commendation
for his handling of the disaster.

Roddenberry left the airlines and
decided that television writing was
his goal, but to pay his rent, he had

to work as a beat cop and later a
researcher for the Los Angeles
Police Department. When his
scripts began to sell (to series
including Dragnet, Playhouse 90
and Four-Star‘ Theater), Rodden-
berry retired from police work.

His script for Have Gun, Will
Travel won a Writers’ Guild
Award, and he became headwriter
for that‘ still-popular series.

NE RODNERRY I

Roddenberry is now a director of
the Writers‘ Guild. -

In his speech Friday, Rodden-
berry said, “TV is not what it was
made to be. The TV audience is
much more intelligent than the
network executives seem to think it
IS.

Perhaps as a way to compensate,
Roddenberry said Star Trek soon
will probably be seen two times a
month. '

-   ' Cats Fight Foes, Odds
   To Reach .500 Mark

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

. You may remember that at the
beginning of the basketball season,
Coach Tim Grgurich said he was
sure his team would go to a
postseason tournament.

"Since then, something has

happened to remove all credence

‘ from that bold prediction—namely,

-7?-Pitt's 7-12 record. .
 Sure. Pitt may be the best 7-12
jtteam in the country. but 7-12 teams
f‘don't get invited to tournaments.
_ Now Grgurich and his Merry
Band face another problem. They
not attend a
tournament. but the question
remaining is “Can they salvage a
_ .500 season?"
There are eight games left on the
Pitt basketball schedule. including
an away contest tonight with

/ nationally ranked Cincinnati. and a

' game at the West Virginia

Coliseum in Morgantown, and
home games against South Caro-
lina and Syracuse, a team that
already has defeated the Panthers
,once this season.

The Cats must win seven of the
next eight games toﬁnish over
.500. and anything less than seven
wins would spell a losing season for
Pitt. This means that the Cats-
must defeat at least three of the
aforementioned four foes.

Realistically speaking. if Grgur-

ich is planning on a winning
‘season. he'll be sorely disappoint-
ed. Better Pitt teams _ have
attempted to beat West Virginia at
Morgantown. including one NCAA
and one NIT participant.

That ‘leaves seven games the

Cats have to win. Tonight's game

against Cincinnati is therefore a
“must" win for the Panthers. for
when they travel to West Virginia.
they'll probably be called for more
personal fouls than they ever
thought possible in one game.
The Cats played close to every
nationally ranked team they've
faced this season until the Rutgers
contest. and there is no reason to
believe they won't play well against
Cincinnati. It's just that although
they have come close. they have yet
to put together a win against one of
the nation's Top 20.
7 It's pretty rough when your
tallest starter is 6-6 (listed as 6-7)
and only one player averages
double figures in the scoring

that makes for tremendous prob-
lems at the foul line. The Panthers
actually beat Virginia from the

ﬁeld, but lost the game from the ,_

charity stripe.

Shooting is another problem."

The team as a whole has shot
45.3% from the ﬁeld, and only
Larry Harris is making more than
50% of his shots. ‘

It's understandable .'"some team
members’ scoring averages will
suffer when a super-shooter like
Harris hits the floor, but still, the
second-highest scorer on the team,
Tom Richards, averages 8.3 pionts
a game. ‘

The guards must take more
scoring responsibility upon them-
selves than they have so far.
Harris can carry the scoring duties
only so far. A balanced attack is
needed.

In four games this season. Harris
was the only Panther to score in
double ﬁgures.

Over the weekend, the Panthers
showed, the makings of a good

attack with guards Wayne Williams ~

and Nedrow. but they must be
consistent.

In order to beat superior teams
like South Carolina and Syracuse.
the Panthers are going to have to
play as they did against Penn
State——as a collection of quality
players that refuse to give up.

The Cats haven't given up all

at Rutgers—and they're not about
to give up now in their quest for a

Here's one for all you riddlers
out there. What's blue and gold,
7-12 and hungry? The Pitt
Panthers, now 7-12 after cleaning
up on Pennsylvania and the
over-edible Penn State, are hungry
for another win. "

But they don't think their 7-12
won-lost record is very funny.

And next on the menu, tonight at
8 p.m., is the University of
Cincinnati. another of those “tough
to chew” opponents. ,

Cincinnati ‘currently is ranked
16th bv the Associated Press and
18th by United Press International.
Last season. the Bearcats went

Cincinnati was looking forward

to another good season, and so far
it has disappointed no_one. A 15-3
record is hardly something about
which to cry. Throw in a 44-game
home winning streak, and the
Bearcats might well consider their
match with a lowly '/-12 ballclub
“in the bag.”

Cincinnati is paced by another of
those tough obstacles. It appears
in the guise of 6-10 sophomore
center Robert
averaging 17 points and 12
.-ebounds per game—the Bearcat
leader in both categories.

Things aren’t what they seem,
however. What if the Panthers had
to face a healthy Cincinnati team?
Miller is playing hurt. Standout
forward Brian Williams (second-
leading scorer with 14 points) and
Mike Jones, a_ stalwart from last
season's tournament team, are not
playing at all. -

Last season, 6-4 guard Steve
Collier was the team's most
valuable player. This season,
partially because of nagging
injuries, he isaveraging less than
eight points per game. ‘
' Still, the Bearcats are another of
those Top 20 opponents that spot
the Panther schedule. And despite
their lowly record, the Panthers can.

Miller, who is .

hardly take Cincy by surprise.

“We've seen Pitt play a couple
of times this year," said Cincin-
nati's Sports Information Director
Jerry Kissel. “I saw them play
against Marquette. and I have to
admit—I wasn't exactly surprised
at how well they did."

So much for the element of
surprise. .

But the Panthers do have a few
cards up their sleeves. One is

“It's a fine thing to have a finger

say, ‘That’s the man.’ ”—Persius.

“That's not my style."

Webster has revived it at Pitt. .

“Basketball is an offensive

Chris Cole, 8-5, .and Bailey and
Grau pinned their helpless oppon-

Pitt's Coach Webster-
Defense Mastermind

(Continued from Page 12)

The
average is between 80 and 90, and
you’ve done a good job if you keep
the total at 60. This year's team is

giving up only 58 shots per game.-

"Anoihcr interesting ‘statistic
concerns defensive recoveries.
We're averaging the same amount

-27--as we did the year we went.

to the NCAA Eastern Finals.

“But those recoveries don't do
us much good unless we put them
in the hoop."

The inability to mount a
sustained offense is one major
reason for the team's record. “But
we’re the best 7-12 team in the
country," Webster said. “I've
heard that from more than one
coach we've been up against.”

Despite the dismal record, the
Panthers are very much a
major-college team. When Web-
ster came to Pitt, however, that
status was questionable.

“There’s no question that this
program has grown tremendous-
ly," he said. “In the seven years
I've been here (he followed Buzz
Ridl to Pitt after a five-year stint
with Ridl at Westminster), Pitt has
gone from mediocre major-college
to a fine major-college program.”

Though Webster will deny it,‘ his
part in Ridl’s rebuilding process
was not small. Defense has been

“amoeba” in particular.

Webster can see many obstacles
that have faced Head Coach Tim
Grgurich in his effort to maintain
Pitt's status as a national conten-
der.

“Coach Grgurich is under a lot of I

pressure, following Coach Ridl,”
he said; “The comparisons and
bad raps are to be expected, but I

~don’t think they reﬂect the job
Coach Grgurich has done.

“I don’t see hg_w_anyone can say
he hasn’t done well in a bad
situation. He’s done a magniﬁcent
job keeping the kids together in

what are trying times. The job he’s
done is really amazing.”

A man in his mid-ﬁfties who has
been coaching basketball for more
than half his life, Webster has no
burning desire to run his own ship.

“At my age, it would be difﬁcult
to run a team. Being a head coach
at the major-college level requires
a lot of energy and stamina. Not
only are you head coach, but there
are a lot of other jobs, like public
relations, that have to be done.”

Webster cites Grgurich’s relative
youth as one of the first-year
coach’s strong points.

“Coaches Grgurich and Hill give
our players intensity and desire
through their youthful and vigorous
approach to coaching. And I think
that in time the hard work and
demanding practices will pay off,”
he said.

“In order to coach basketball,
you have to like both the game and
working with young people, and
when you do, you get a lot out of
your work, as I do. I don’t think I'll
ever get too old to enjoy my work.

  Sprintswim Star

A   Schepner Maki

BY JIM GEFSKY

The majority of swimmers are
busy almost 365 days of the year
with their chosen sport. The
Tankers’ John Schepner is unique
in that during the summer he takes
time off from swimming.

“During the summer I relax,
coach a little and work on other

-things besides swimmng,” he said.

“There's both a disadvantage and
an advantage to that.

“The disadvantage is that I lose
three months of training. The
advantage is that though I think I
have a lot of natural ability, I know

I have much less time to train, and.

that makes me practice much
harder when I get back to school in
September.”

' Schepner used to swim the
500-yard freestyle and the 2,000-
yard relay. He now swims the 50-,
100- and 200-yard freestyles, and
considers the 200 his best event.

Last Friday, against Kent State,
Schepner won the 100 free with a
48.67 and the 200 free with a

1:45.56. His record times age‘ a 47.4 _

in the 100 and a 1:43.7 in the 200.
His greatest thrill was Pitt's

victory in the Penn State Relays —

this year.

“That victory convinced me Pitt
is probably the No. 1 team
around,” he said.

Schepner thinks Pitt can go
undefeated this season if it beats
Ohio State.

‘-‘Maryland is an important meet,
but I think Ohio State is the team to
beat,” he said. “Our team has had
a few problems due to lost players,
illness and other things, but we
have one of our best teams ever.”

Schepner is a junior majoring in
economics. He thinks swimming
helps his academics, for it puts him
on a rigid schedule and thus forces
him to discipline himself thorough-

ly for both. .

School. but since it didn’t havea

For me swimming is a good way to

Wings, ‘‘I spend part of each day
thanking the man who invented the
mask and cursing the player who
invented the slap shot.”

The mast was first used in 1929
by Clint Benedict of the defunct
Montreal Maroons, but only while;
his fractured nose healed. The
mask was a crude device. Made of
leather, it protected Benedict's
forehead, nose, cheeks and chin,
leaving his eyes still completely
vulnerable. Because the mask
obscured his vision on low shots,
Benedict cast it out.

Thirty years later, Plante, then
with the Montreal Canadiens,
began wearing a ﬁberglass mask
after a shot ripped open his cheek.’
It has now become the goalie’s
most cherished piece of equipment. ;
Ken Dryden of the Canadiens wast‘
one of the barefaced goalies who.
began to wear the mask regularly.

“Not having had it off for a long
time,” he said, “I don't know
exactly, but hypothetically, I’m
sure it does give me more
conﬁdence. I think ‘if I had
continued on without wearing the
mask, Iwould have been more shy
in close situations. If I would ever

revert now to not wearing the
mask. I would be much less at ease
with myself and much more
cautious."

Andy Brown, formerly of the
Pittsburgh Penguins, has shunned
the mask and many people attend a
game, not to see good hockey, but
to be present if and when Brown
should meet his fate. Wayne
Stephenson, of the Philadelphia
Flyers. believes a goalie should
first worry about stopping the
puck. and then about preventing an
injury.

“When you're playing goal,” he
said, “you know how to look after

yourself out there. It’s going to be .

a freak shot that hits you and, if it
does, you're wearing the best of
equipment and hopefully that’s
enough.”

But many times it is not enough-

rather than going after the puck
like you should. Then, all of a
sudden, the puck's going to deﬂect
and hit you in the throat or
something. You never know."

A goalkeeper must build up his

confidence and even be a bit cocky’

if he is to excel. He will shove an
opponent away from the front of
the goal or even whack him on the

shinguards with his big piece of

lumber to intimidate a player and
perhaps prevent a goal.

“A goalie must feel confident,"
said the Chicago Black Hawks’
coach Billy Reay. “He has to feel
he can and should stop any shot
directed at him. He can't afford to
have any self-doubt-. He has to be
the most conﬁdent man on the
ice.

But a goalie cannot be expected
tostop every shot ‘even though a
coach or the crowd feels he should.
If he lets in a bad goal, the crowd
can be brutal in its reply and make
even the greatest netminder feel
like an outcast. Yet when it’s
behind the goalie, the crowd can
give him added incentive.

“When the crowd's on your back
it’s tough,” said the California
Seals’ Gilles Meloche, “especially

the game during the l950’s and
now every goalie must have
nightmares because of it.

Penguins’ Gary Inness revealed,
“so you try to pick up subconscious
things, like the position and angle
of the shooter, to find out where it’s
headed. Then you position yourself
and, hope you stop it.”
Goaltending will continue to be a
hazardous occupation. The brave
men who make their living by it and
the young kids who do it for fun will
spend many sleepless nights

BY PATTY TASCARELLA the Slippery Rock meet over the

weekend. was not missed in the
least because of an increased effort
from the other team members.

The floor exercises showcased
the incredible talent of Huldah
Jones. who totalled 7.75 points in
her second performance of the
season. Jones hadn't worked out in
over a year, since leaving the team
during the ’75 campaign. And
considering those Nureyevian leaps
and that gazelle-like grace, it looks
like Severyn won't be the only
name in the Pitt lineup synony-
mous with invariably excellent
performances. '

The Pantherette gymnastics
team earned its second victory of
last
night, 88.6-54.0 «

The Pitt team took an early and
easy lead in the vaulting competi-

tion. and its performances never
faltered.

“I told them to score at least 88
points," said Pantherette Coach
Donna DeMarino, “and they all
laughed because we were without
Cyndee (Severyn)."

“Tonight was the first time she

“We rearranged her routine, and

The Pantherettes will take to the

“There aren’t many ‘colleges

McDaniel explained. “We’re
trying to ﬁnd some competition
before the Slippery Rock meet.
What we’ll probably do is go to an
AAU meet for women.”

Despite a few minor injuries,
such as the inevitable shin splints,

. the Pantherettes are in good shape

and are ready to tear up the turf

“In- general, the freshmen are

“Marie "Ribik is doing well———last

So, there is every indication of
Pitt upsetting the Rock.

“We’ve never beaten Slippery

it'll be a big step forward. I think
we will."

Even though -the football

season ended ~ some time ago,
Panther quarterback Bob Haygood
is still out there playing—not on
the football ﬁeld, but on the
basketball court.
V Haygood went straight from the
Sun Bowl, where he was- voted the
game's most valuable player, to
Coach Tim Grgurich's roundball
practices. .

Being an outstanding performer
in two sports is rare, but Haygood
uses his quickness, agility and
all-around athletic ability to his
advantage, finding many similari-
ties between his two favorite
pastimes. ‘

"Playing quarterback involves a
lot of brainwork," he said as an
example, “but then so does being a
playmaker in basketball. The
experience I get from playing both
sports will help me in each one."

The 6-0 I180-pound quarterback,
who doubles as a guard on the
basketball squad, is considered;by
many to be one of the finest
all-around athletes in Pitt history.

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Terry.

Hanratty was once in the same
shoes.
Pa., was a star in both football and
basketball, but, as we know, chose
football as his career. Legend has
it, that Hanratty could stand at
mid-court on the basketball floor
and throw a football through the
hoop seven ‘out of ten times. Why
he didn't stick with -basketball at
Notre Dame is unknown.
Haygood has been facing the
same decision. Though he had a
very successful year in football (336

Haygood may -not be shooting for a
grid career, despite having another.
season to prove himself.

“I feel I could play longer, and I .

feel more comfortable playing
basketball,” he said. “I guess I'm
into it a lot more. I feel I could be

. more dedicated to basketball than

to football.” ‘
Haygood. from East Point,

Georgia, earned All-State honors

twice in basketball at Russell High,

along with being the Regional and, .-

State MVP in football. .He. also
lettered three times and, won
honors in baseball. Here at Pitt,
Haygood .led the junior varsity

basketball team in scoring last year»

and has scored 18 points so far for
the varsity this season.

Though he chooses basketball.
that’s not to say Haygood doesn’t
love football, too.

“I really enjoy football,” he said,
“because there is more excitement
as everyone goes through so many
various things in one play. In

basketball, there are five guys out  "

there more or less on their own.
But football has eleven men
depending on each other. ‘

“The key to playing both sports .

is in being able to keep your poise.
We get big crowds here (Pitt-
Stadium) and I got a chance to play
in the National Invitational Tourna-
merit last year, , and it can get
frightening out there.”

As a junior, Haygood is a. 

potential starter at guard next
season, after the departure of Tom
Richards, now a~senior— rovidin '
an injury on the‘ ‘foot all fiel
doesn’t prohibit this.

“I never think about getting hurt

. in basketball asldojin football,’’he . 
1- said.

“You can get] hurt" in
basketball, but there's more of a
chance you will in football because
there is contact on every play.”

. ’ When does Haygood find time to ' 
. rest? He doesn't. Once basketball 0 ‘

season ends in March, he will then

~ start preparing for spring and

summer football practices before

the grid season and the entire cycle , . A

repeats itself. V 2
Just as long as he doesn't wear
himself out. ‘ ‘
