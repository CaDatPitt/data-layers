By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The six Student Government
Board presidential candidates
officially began their quest
toward the highest student gov-
ernment position at Pitt last '
night by explaining why their
experience makes them the
best choice. *

“Obviously, all of them have
worked extensively with stu-
dents and the administration,”
junior Tom Brighton said. “As
student voters, we will have to_
choose between those candi-
dates already entrenched in the
[SGB] and those with a new
‘ voice.” A

Brighton was one of several
hundred students who . attend-
ed “Meet the Candidates” in
David Lawrence Hall to learn
more about the six candidates

SGB candidates answer questions at "Meet the Candidates" last night in D.L. Auditorium.

Board candidates agree on two main
issues: public safety and community

"°canidates,

running for SGB president an.d
the 14 running for board posi-
tions. Of the presidential
three , Tara
Munkatchy, Tony Moody and
Joe Foner —'— are currently
board members. Ross Pasquale
served on the 1992 SGB,
whereas Eric “Buck” Scérbo
and Doug Herman have not
been SGB members.

According to Foner, the posi-
tion of SGB president requires
someone with a proven track
record in board matters.

When this year’s Student Government Board
campaign ends, only eight candidates will
have made the final cut.

However, last night’s “Meet the Candidates”
wasn’t what would be expected in a political
race which will eliminate six people. i '

There was no mudslinging among the board
candidates. No accusations of credibility—dam-
aging behavior echoed through the PA system
in David Lawrence Auditorium. ‘ —

The 14 board candidates did not deliver
platfonn speeches as SGB’s presidential candi-
dates did earlier in the evening. O

Instead, the program’s format was turned
into a question—and—answer session between
the audience and the candidates.

And while the candidates did not go into
much detail on what they plan to accomplish
and how they plan to do it, they seemed to
agree on the importance of two issues: public
safety and community.

Board candidate Jason McCright said more
support is needed for the Oakland
Community-Oriented Police program, which
unites Pittsburgh and campus police officers in
an effort to increase safety around the Pitt
campus.

Asbestos
  removed

from under
Bruce Hall

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Housing and Support
Services Department removed
asbestos from a steam pipe under-
neath Bruce Hall yesterday.

According to Director of
Environmental Health and Safety‘
Larry Keller, a leak in a steam pipe
which runs underneath Bruce and
McCormick halls caused‘ the
asbestos, which insulated the pipe,
to peel away, leaving the asbestos
exposed.

According to Gary Zolyak, an
attorney with the Allegheny County
Health Department Bureau of
Environmental Quality, Pitt faces
fines between $100 to $2,500 per
day of violation. No decision has yet
been made whether the Allegheny
County Health Department will
prosecute or penalize Pitt.

According to Keller, health depart-
ment workers are using the
Glovebag Technique to remove the
asbestos. This method is common in
the removal of asbestos from heat-
ing, ventilation and air-conditioning
ducts, sort pipe runs, valves, joints,
elbows and other surfaces in a non-
contained work area.

The glovebag is constructed and
installed in a manner that it sur-
rounds the area from which the
asbestos will be removed and con-
tains all asbestos fibers released dur-
ing the removal process.

Asbestos abatement is regulated
by Article XX of the rules and regu-
lations on air pollution control
which details in large part the
removal of asbestos. I

BAS to propose minority enrollment plan to O'Connor

By Monika Colbert
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Black Action Society is proposing
a program to Chancellor]. Dennis
O’Connor to increase the African-
American enrollment at Pitt by 500 stu-
dents. ~ _
Through Project 500, the university
wouldidentify Pittsburgh public schools,

supporting them with educational mate-

rials and direct involvement with tutor-

ing and mentoring by undergraduates.
BAS is proposing to sponsor Fort Pitt

Elementary School in Garﬁeld and as the

program progresses they will according-

ly _add more schools. Concentrating on
the beginning stages of students’ educa-
tion and seeing them through high
school will help insure steadily increas-
ing enrollment at the university stage,

according to BAS.

“Project 500 came out of a need to
reach back into the community and help
the youth within the community. And in
doing that we could figure out a way to
help the youth not in ‘terms of support,
but to figure out a way that we could
impact their lives forever,” said BAS
Chair Keith Davis.

The project would be a single-handed
effort by the University of Pittsburgh,
however members of black student orga-
nizations at Carnegie Mellon University
and Chatham and Duquesne colleges are
proposing the same program to their
administration as well, Davis said.

Davis said the project’s goal is “to have
more of an outreach in terms of more
African—American [students] going to

those schools to tutor and be a role ,

model.”

“lWe also] anticipate creating programs
through the Black Cultural Center such
as allowing Fort Pitt Elementary‘ School
students the opportunity to spend a
weekend on campus throughout the
semester with African—American under-
graduates at which time we will have
programs for them in hopes of getting
them motivated to continue to achieve
academically,” he said. ’

Also through cultural center program-
ming, Project SO0 hopes to bring the
National Youth Summer Program, which
is federally sponsored, to Pitt. The sum-
mer program is for underrepresented
youth, according to Davis. It will allow
for summer counseling, provide social
components and encourage team build-
ing and competitiveness within the
youth. “It will provide an outlet for
African-American youth during the sum-

mer instead ‘of the traditional options
that the ‘streets’ offer,” Davis said.
Member Brian Bolton said, “Project
500 would be encouraging for black stu-
dents here right now because it would
help us feel more welcome. It would
bring into the university a hands-on
activity for black students to get involved

‘ in since there is little here for us to do

3!

now.

To fund Project 500, BAS and the
office of the chancellor are having a raf-
fle on campus to support Fort Pitt
Elementary and its endeavor to gain
more educational materials for the
upcoming new year, according to Davis.

“The project would be a very produc-
tive program for the university. It would
be a step toward the so-called diversity
that the university has. A big step,”
Bolton said.

Former deputy prime minister talks to law students

By Jennifer Vernet

.Staff Writer

Lord Geoffrey Howe, former deputy
prime minister of England under Margaret
Thatcher, spoke to about 25 law students at
a lecture held at the Teplitz Memorial
Courtroom yesterday afternoon. ’ i

The lecture, entitled “The Role of Law in
International Affairs,” was sponsored by the
School of Law and the Pittsburgh ofﬁce of

 

Jones, Day, Reavis &_ Pogue, an internation-
al law firm. ‘

“International affairs is certainly a part
played by international law,” Howe said.
“International law must evolve to find
acceptance in the world.”

Howe said although the road to interna-
tional law “winds upward to the very end,”
the need for global decision making exists.

“There is a need for global interdepen-
dence in problem solving,” Howe said.

HUNGRY FOB 

“International law allows for international
decision making.”

Howe was knighted upon his appoint-
ment as solicitor general in 1972, and has
an endless list of accomplishments.

‘ Aside from his position under Thatcher,
Howe served as minister for Trade and
Consumer Affairs in former Prime Minister
Edward Heath’s cabinet, secretary of state
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,

Students not satisfied
with Meet the Candidates

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

“Meet the Candidates” kicked
off a heated 1994 Student
Government Board election
season last night, but some of
the 300 students present said
they felt left out in the cold.

"\‘</hat I saw was 20 students
saying almost the same thing,”
first—year student Patrick
Mitchell said. “I expected the
speeches to be typically politi-
cal and vague, but I really
thought I would hear some
new ideas.” '

The event first presented the
six SGB presidential candidates
‘who each gave a short summa-
ry of their position and
answered questions from the
audience. The 14 board candi-
dates, from which students will
choose a board of eight on
Nov. 17, were later presented to
answer questions.

“It will be hard to remember
which board member took
what position,” junior Diane
McLaughlin said. “I come to
these events, read the newspa-
per, and it is hard for me to dis-
tinguish between candidates. I
hope freshmen don’t just vote
according to whoever has the
nicest poster.” ’

McLaughlin was one of sever-
al people‘ who said the candi-
dates, especially the board can-
didates, should have been
given a better opportunity to
elaborate on their platforms.

“It seemed pretty superﬁcial,”
Susie Schuler said. .“I would’ve
liked to have seen most of the
candidates get more specific.
No one really gave details

about their plans.”

This year’s unusually large
number of candidates includes
people who have little experi-
ence with the board or with
other student groups.
According to senior Jennifer
Johnson, some of the candi-
dates were underqualified.

“There were a few strong
people,” Johnson said. “But a
lot of people who haven’t been
involved in anything think they
can go into SGB and change
things.”

Among the popular topics
addressed by candidates were
safety, communication by the

I SGB and the apathy of the stu-

dent body. Junior Tara Marquis
said that when candidates bring

up these issues, they should be '

prepared to offer a solution.

“A lot of the them talked
about the problem of apathy
among students, but when stu-
dents don’t go to the SGB, the
board should reach out to the
students,” Marquis said. “The
board must give students a rea-
son to want to go to them.”

Despite their similarities on
issues, Chris Kocher said he has
a better understanding of the
people involved in the election.

“At these events you see the
person behind the campaign
poster,” Kocher said. “By their
speeches and the way they
handle themselves, you can
pretty much tell if they’re wor-
thy of a position.”

Lisa Mirkin agreed that one

can tell a lot about candidates
by their poise. “Even during a
small speech, you can tell what
is important to a candidate. It
makes an impression.”

 

Bldc:/e Week provides diversity,
dreddloc/es and understanding

By Monika Colbert
Staff Writer '

Students will not have to
leave Pittsburgh to explore
the Rastafarian culture which
will be part of Pitt’s annual
Black Week.

“Black Week gives students
on campus the opportunity to
get a better understanding of
African culture, the ways of
African people and how
African people think,” said
Michael Barge, deputy chair
of the Black Action Society.

Gospel Night kicks off
Black Week Sunday at 4 in
the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room and will fea-
ture The Ohio State University

The biggest crowd drawer

of Black Week is the speak-
ers, according to Barge. This

BiGALA schedules elections and

plans release of newsletter, Pria'e

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

Members of the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance announced elections for male co-
president and female co-chair at last night’s
general meeting.

“We’ll be having elections in two weeks,”
member Evan James said.

Members said elections are one of the many
activities BiGALA'has planned over the next
few weeks.

Sacha Layos, co-president of BiGALA, said
she will be attending a national forum next
week. i

“I’m going to North Carolina for a confer-
ence held by the National Gays and Lesbians
for Creating Change,” she said.

The sixth annual “Creating Change” confer-
ence will cover such issues as civil rights,
health care and international organization for
gay rights. .

Members said they will be working on

issues in Pittsburgh as well. Todd Kinavey, co-
business manager of BiGALA, said that one of
the important events on their agenda will be
the release of a newsletter in about two
weeks.

“We had a meeting Monday night about the
newsletter. The working name right now is
Pride. We want to have copies for the William
Pitt Union, local coffee shops, in hopes of
reaching people who usually don’t come to
meetings,” he said. .

James said that BiGALA will also be spon-
soring a bisexual discussion group.

“We’ll talk‘ about issues specific or nonspe-
ciﬁc to being bisexual,” he said.

“The group will definitely start in a couple
weeks,” Layos said.

- Next Tuesday, members said they will bring

in’ a speaker from the Gay and Lesbian 9

Community Center.

‘They are coming to tell us what they do
and what they have planned for the future,”
James said.

Pitts Scbool

0fEa’ucaii0n

focuses on increase of
African Americans in
Pittsburgh public scbools

By Marisa Rocca
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Education is presently
accepting applications for the
African—American Fellowship
program.

The program seeks people
who are mid-career and would
like to get into teaching, said
Professor Charles Allen, coordi-
nator of the program. All who
meet the set criteria and have
the necessary credentials are
also encouraged to apply.
Those in the math and science
fields are particularly encour-
aged to apply, since the pool for
those subjects is not very large.

The goal of this program is to
increase the number of African-
American teachers in the
Pittsburgh City School District.
Approximately 52 percent of the
students are African American,
while approximately only 20
percent of the teachers are
African American.

The goal of this program is
also to provide an African-
American role model, which is a
great need, said Allen. Now is
the time to increase African-
American teachers in Pittsburgh
and African-American role mod-

els, he said.

The program _is funded by the
University of Pittsburgh, the
Pittsburgh Foundation and the
Pittsburgh Board of Education.
The fellowship gives annual
grants of up to $17,500 asa
stipend.

In addition, the tuition of the
recipients is paid. Up to five
applicants are accepted into the
program each year. Those who
complete the program receive a
masters of arts in teaching and
teacher certification in
Pennsylvania.

After certification, participants
must teach for two years in the
Pittsburgh Public Schools. This
is in either the secondary or ele-
mentary level.

Eligibility for the fellowship
requires that the applicant must
be of African—American descent,
have a bachelor’s degree in the
subject to-be taught, fulfill pre-
requisite course work, have
three letters of recommendation
and have successfully processed
a Pennsylvania State Police
criminal check.

For applications or questions,
Contact Allen or Professor Mary
Patricia Thomas, pre—admission
counselor for the program, at

but if you’re going to get
shot on the way to your
shuttle stop, it really
doesn’t do you much good,”
McCright said. “The biggest
step toward safety is increas-
ing awareness of the OCOP
program and seeing if we
can get more officers out
there.”

McCright said the size of the
Pitt community requires a
great deal of police patrols. “I
don’t think we should get the

- short end of the stick when it

comes to police protection,”
he said. '
Additionally, McCright said
parts of Pitt’s safety concerns
also lie in the hands
of Pittsburgh mayor-elect
Tom Murphy, who often
addressed the city’s crime
problems during his recent

. campaign.

“I think it’s time we call him
on the carpet and make him

answer those problems,” he
said.

Board candidate Todd
Neufeld said he would like to
see increased student group
involvement with personal
safety programs such as Pitt
police officer Curtis Smith’s
Buy Yourself A Minute pro-
gram.

Candidate David Deluliis,
a member of the Students
United for Responsible
Government (SURG) ticket,
said a closer relation-
ship between Pitt students and
the Oakland community
will help solve the safety prob-
lem.

“If you don’t feel safe-
on campus, you don’t really
want to be here,” Deluliis
said.

Deluliis said his family,
which lives in South Oakland,
views Pitt’s relationship with

its surrounding neighborhood-

as an adversarial one. “They

see the university as a neces-
sary evil. We have to break
that down.”

Board candidate and fel-
low SURG member Roger
Hartman agreed that the “rela—
tionship between the universi-
ty and the community is quite
poor.” Hattman said he would
like to see the implementation
of a community affairs com-
mittee which would begin vol-
unteer ‘service projects in
Oakland.

Additionally, Hattman said
hewill try to start a pro-
gram which will allow stu-
dents to earn academic credits
by performing community
service projects under the
guidance of a Pitt faculty
member.

Current SGB Academic
Affairs chair and board candi-
date Chris Fedeli said improv-
ing communications between
the board and students is a
high priority.

“lstudentsl as a group have
considerable power in inﬂu-
encing University decisions,”
Fedeli said.

“My first goal would be to
open the lines of communica-
tion between SGB and the stu-
dents. By doing this, we'll
have students who are
informed, who know what’s
going on and know how they
can get involved.”

“By increasing involvement
in student government, we can
get a greater sense of commu-
nity,” he added.

Candidate Cheston Reisler
said he is trying to increase
student involvement by send-

_ing out surveys to “most of the

undergraduate students” at Pitt
and allowing them to voice
their concerns.

“It’s not important what I
think needs to be done,”
Reisler said. “I want to ask oth-
ers what they think, because
I’m representing them.”

When Satchel Paige took the
mound for the Cleveland
Indians in the 1948 World Series
as a 42-year-old rookie the
negro leagues had just folded,
Jackie Robinson had broken the
color barrier the year before
and was named Rookie of the
Year playing for the Brooklyn
Dodgers. Integration in baseball
was now established and the
disintegration of black baseball

along with its cultural value to "

African Americans had begun.
Kings On T be Hill: Basebczllis
Forgotten Men takes a look at
the men who made the game a
pastime for black America, the
heroes and legends whose

exploits were nearly lost with

integration, but whose ‘accom-
plishments remain irreplace-
able.

Writer/producer Rob Ruck

takes on thehistory of the negro”

leagues with an hour of inter-
views with the likes of Satchel
Paige, Harold Tinker, Bob
Thurman, Monte Irvin and other
greats with additional commen-
tary by journalist Mal Goode,
playwright August Wilson and
authors John Holway and John
Edgar Wideman. Witli narration
by Ossie Davis and a score by

Nathan Davis, the production is
never less than effective. But
the spirit behind this effort is
best described by the documen-
tary itself in a quote from former
commissioner A. Bart Giamatti
concerning a 1988 ceremony in
which the Pirates honored the
Homestead Grays. “We must
never lose sight of our history,
insofar as it is ugly, never to
repeat it, and insofar as it is glo-
rious, to cherish it.”

Pittsburgh figures heavily in
this history. Rising out of the
mills black teams began to orga-
nize themselves here and in
other industrial cities in the
North after blacks were pushed
out of organized white ball at
the turn of the century. As
Pittsburglfs labor force grew so
did its black teams. The
Homestead Grays were the first
team in town to gather enough
talent to compete on a national
level and later the Pittsburgh
Crawfords backed by Hill
District numbers baron Gus
Greenlee would assemble some
of baseball’s finest players in
their own right. In the 19305
and 405 Pittsburgh was the cen-
ter of the Negro National

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

When you think about Miami
football, three things immedi-
ately pop into mind: National
Championship contention,
record—breaking quarterbacks
and a ton of trash talkin’.

Well, the championship sea-
son is still a possibility, the
quarterback position has turned
over and .is producing huge
dividends and the trash talking
— though not as prevalent as it
once was — is still ﬂying.

The ‘Canes (6-1), who enter
Pitt Stadium ranked fourth in
the country (AP), have lost only
to,No. 1 Florida St., 28-10, in
what then was the most antici-
pated game of the season.

But despite having a pair of
undefeated teams ahead of the
team,‘ and another pair looming

National title still in sight

behind, Miami is still holding
on to hopes for its fifth
National Championship — as it
did in 1989, when it lost to
Florida St., 24-10, yet still came
away with the national crown.

“There’s no question we’ve
been talking about [winning
the national title],” Miami head
coach Dennis Erickson said.
“But Florida St. controls their
own destiny and all we can do
is win.” 8

Once again, the ‘Canes are
attacking with a strong-armed
quarterback, though this one

went through a little different

scenario than the others.
Before the Syracuse game,
Erickson replaced starting quar-
terback Frank Costa with
sophomore QB Ryan Collins, a
6-foot—2—inch scat-back of a sig-
nal-caller. Collins, unlike stat-
ues like Gino Toretta and

back and he’s real talented,”
Pitt nose tackle Tom Barndt
said. “He can run, he can pass
and he gives them a dimension

 

worry about on Saturday.

“Ryan Collins adds a different
dimension to our offense — he
can move around and does a
few different things [than Frank
Costa],” Erickson said. “He is an
extremely good thrower but the
thing that he adds is that he
can move- he makes big plays
and that makes a big differ-
ence.”

“lCollins] is probably their
most active runner that they
haven’t had recently,” Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors said.

“I watched the game
Saturday and I’ve been keeping

 

that they haven’t had before —
althpugh all their other QB’s
have ended up being stars.”

Collins, since his insertion
into the line-up in the 49-0 win
over the Orange, has complet-
ed 39 of 62 passes for five
touchdowns and a 149.4 rating.
-He has also rushed 16 times for
93 yards — a 7 yard per gain
average.

“I hate playing against quar-
terbacks that can run and
scramble,” Barndt said. “When
you play QB’s like this, ‘every-

“If we never played against a

good scrambler before then it _

would be tougher, but you take
things you learn from [Virginia
Tech’s Maurice], DeShazo and
lLouisville’s Jeff] Brohm, and it
helps prepare you for things
like this. You just hope he has
nowhere to run.”

But Collins is not Miami’s
only rushing threat. Far! from it,
actually, as the team features a
one—back set that has, in the
past, pushed Alonzo Highsmith
and Steven McGuire into the
national spotlight.

This year’s one—back offense
features Donnell Bennett, a 6-
foot-2-inch junior. Bennett has
rushed for 451 yards this year
—— 64.4 per game — and is tied
for the team lead with five
touchdowns.

Miami, as usual, is deep at
the wide—receiver spot. Chris T.

“I feel that they are one of
the best if not the best defen-

Pitt running back Curtis Martin,

By Keith Pompey
staff Writer

Last’ Thursday night, William

R West IV, a first-year player who

has been virtually unheard of
thus far in 1993, was told by
the University of Pittsburgh
football coaching staff that he
was about to start his first colle-
giate football game in a couple
of hours before a national tele-
vision audience.

West, a 5-foot—8-inch, 193-
pound running back from
Smithfield, Ohio, responded to
the challenge by rushing for
108 yards on 20 carries. He also
scored two T D’s.

West’s heroics helped Pitt
win its second game of the
season by whipping Rutgers,
21-10;

‘ “I was nervous, it was a big
game for us on national TV,”
West said. “But I’m usually ner-
vous before every game, so it
wasn’t out of the ordinary. The

quicker I could settle down, _

the better I knew I could play.”
He was the star of the game,
but what he did ‘on the ﬁeld is
only a small part of his talents.
To the ‘average rookie, West’s
latest heroics would be a way
of obtaining their biggest goals
of becoming a big-time football

Pitt with a degree in electrical
engineering.

“I would love to go to the
NFL, but I’m not basing my life
on that; I really want an engi-
neering degree;” West, a 4.0
National Honor Society student

of merit scholar status, in high.

school, said. “I wanted to be an

engineer since the ﬁfth grade. In

love math and the sciences. I
try to stay away from english
and history, I like them but

they don’t stimulate anything
because my strong points are
math and science.

“I thought electrical engineer-
ing was the way to go.”

Doesn’t it seem strange that
he wants to become an engi-
neer rather than follow his
father’s and three uncles’ foot~
steps in the NFL?

Not to the West family.

“To grow up in a football
family like this, sports were

never pushed on me,” West
said. “My dad introduce me to
all kind of things. I did a lot of
everything as a kid.”

“Billy was always inquisitive,”

his father William West III said.

By. Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer .

The entire Miami football
squad is nicknamed the
Hurricanes, but the name is
also fitting for the team’s line-
backing corps.

The Canes’ linebackers are
not very big, but as Miami head
coach Dennis Erickson put it,
they are fast, physical and play
with reckless abandon.

“Due to graduation we are
starting some young lineback-
ers. They are not real big, but

0 they make up for it withspeed

and hard hitting,” Erickson
said.

One of these young, fast,
smart, hard-hitting players starts
at the weakside linebacker pos-
tion. He_is sophomore Rohan
Marley — who was born in
1972 and just happens to be a

son of the late Jamaican reg-
gae-king Bob Marley.

This 5—foot-8-inch, 205—pound
“Buffalo Soldier” has good
strength (able to bench press
560 pounds) and good speed
for a linebacker (4.78 in the 40-
yard dash). Marley ,.is making

’ quite an impact with his perfor-

mance on the field. He has
earned a reputation as being
one of the hardest hitters on
the team and is known for his
intensity and his instinct.

His efforts are not going
unnoticed by Erickson and the
Miami coaching staff.

“I think he’s played every
down for us last year. This year
he got a little banged up and
has been off and on. He’s a
good player who is not very
big, but makes up for it with
his physical attributes — espe-
cially his speed,” Erickson said.

Rohan Marley has 51 tackles for the Hurricanes in 1993.

“Rohan was probably one of
the top defensive players for us
last year,” defensive coordina-
tor T ommy Tuberville said. “He
gives 110 percent every play.”

Marley sees his football savvy
as being a combination of
many traits —— not just physical,
but mental as well.

“I see my talent in football as
being a mix of my brains,
because I learn a lot from my
coaches and use that knowl-

edge, and the physical attribut-
es I was born with -—- such as
speed, strength, endurance and
stamina,’.’ Marley said.

While attending high school
and playing football 0 for
Palmetto in Miami, he earned
all—state honors starting at line-
backer for two years —— racking
up 132 tackles and winning
MVP and Outstanding
Defensive Player for Palmetto.

lege ball at Miami, and surpris-
ingly, they happened to be the
only big school who really
recruited him.

Perhaps Marley fits in so well
with the Hurricanes because
his style of play matches the
Hurricanes’ style of play to a
tee. Also, attending UM gave
Marley a chance to play near
home — he was raised in
Miami by his. grandmother,
Cedella Booker.

“I was born and raised in this
area so I felt comfortable here.
I was able to stay close to
home  I also felt like my
football style fit here because I
got a chance to run around and
hit people,” Marley said.

And a great deal of people
have been hit by Marley as he
recorded 59 tackles for the
Hurricanes in 1992 alone. That
ranked him seventh on the
team last year —- a fine feat
consideringuhe was second
string at the time behind Jessie

'Armstead.

‘ But don’t confuse Marley’s
tenacity with his off—field per-
sonality. In fact, just the oppo-
site is true, as told by Pitt run-
ning back Curtis Martin.

“Rohan’s a real nice guy off
the field. He’s a real quiet-type
and not cocky. I got a chance
to know him when we palled
around together at a football
camp in Miami. But when he
steps on to the field everything
changes,” Martin said.

It seems football -may be in
the future for Marley, but he’s
really not worried about the
future rightnow.

“As far as the future, I don’t
know yet. It’s way too early to
tell. I am majoring in sociology
and I enjoy that a lot.'But I am
just concentrating on the pre-
sent right now,” Marley said.

Something just as noteable as
Rohan Marley’s present is his
past. His father, Bob Marley,
was an inspirational legend and
still is today. Rohan remembers
his father as having a unique
way of looking at life.

“He was a great leader, not
because he was strict, he felt

there was really no" reason to

be strict, but because he would
make any sacrifice,” Marley
said.

So Rohan seems to be using
his father’s philosophy and
actually following in his father’s
footsteps, being a leader by
making sacrifices and giving
110 percent.

The only difference?

Rohan gives his perfor-
mances on a stage that mea-
sures 100 yards long -—- goal
line to goal line.

issue at all,” Billy West III
said. “I knew early on that
others would probably try to
make that a little pressure.
He was always faced with
people saying, ‘you know
your dad and uncles,’ but I

time ago that I would be
proud of him no matter
what he did.

“To play pro balljisto be
very, very lucky indeed.
Only 1 percent of college
seniors get drafted and 1
percent of that group actual-
ly make the team. That is
not a measure of what type
of athlete you are. The only
thing I want him to do is
play the game because he
likes to play the game,”
West III said.

But whilerfootball was
never pushed on the
younger West by his family,
he developed into the best
halfback to every play in the
Ohio Valley.

As a four—year letter win-
ner, West became the Ohio
Valley’s all-time rushing
leader with more than 5,000

make playing football an

really tried to stress a long"

yards and 63 rushing touch— _

downs. Despite these num-
bers, when it was all said
and done the critics claimed,
“He is only good because of
his family.”

“I don’t like when people
say an athlete is just good
because his dad was good,”
West said. “Ability is some-
thing that you come up
with, too. I put my time in.
To this time, I have been
playing for ten years and
have always been a running
back while my dad was a
cornerback.”

If West wants respect,‘
there's no need to look fur-

ther than his own team. ‘

“He is different from
everybody else,” rookie Pitt
defensive back Kenyon
Robinson said. “He is real
focused and knows what he
wants to do, not just in foot-
ball, but academically, too.

“He gives 110 percent in
practice and the games. No
matter if it’s kickoff or taking
a handoff..

“Billy is a down-to-earth,
laid back person," safety
David Sumner said. "But on
the field, he’s a blend of
Rodney Hampton and Joe‘
Morris.” —

leads Miami in sacks with six,
while he is sixth in total tackles

with 43.

The linebacking corps is rela-
tively young, as four first-year
players are listed on the depth
chart. Rohan Marley, son of late
reggae singer Bob Marley, has
exploded this season. Despite
standing only 5-foot—8-inches,
Marley’s play has sparked a
defense that is the top-rated D’
in the Big East and leads the
conference in every team

(107.1 yards per game), passing
(89.4), total (274.6) and scoring

he’s someone I know,” Martin
said of Marley.

“He seems like the quiet
type, but when he gets on the
field that’s when he gets him-
self hyped up. He plays with
high intensity.”

“He’s had to play about every,

down,” Erickson said. “He
plays the game the way it
should be played — physically,
although he is not very big.”

And while he can hit with
the biggest of trees, Marley,
like most everyone wearing
orange and green, can talk up
a storm.

The squad has quieted down
since former head coach Jimmy
Johnson left to coach the Dallas
Cowboys, but, while he has
made strides in keeping the
‘Canes from taunting too much,
Erickson has not totally elimi-
nated the art of yang.

“I think he has changed their
attitude a little bit, but they
don’t really have to do a lot of
trash-talkin’ because their such
a strong team,” Barndt said.
“Most of the time, I don’t do

how they get themselves

Fearless

Directed by Peter Weir

With Jeff Bridges, Rosie Perez,
and Isabella Rossellini ‘

As Fearless opens, Max
Kleinﬂeff Bridges) wanders
confusedly through a comfield,
completely dazed and lost, until
he emerges into the scene of
the plane crash he just sur-
vived. As Fearless opens, the

audience wanders confusedly‘

through a cornﬁeld, completely
dazed and lost with Max Klein,
but never really emerges. Max
Klein goes on without us, and
watching the rest of the film is
like being trapped in the stupor
of the cornfield, peering out at
the story through a thick wall of
dried up stalks and leaves.

As the plane crashes, Max
faces his fear of ﬂying and sud-
denly reaches a state of com-
plete peace, and acquires a
feeling of invincibility which

« leaves him unable to deal with
his grief. He ignores the pain
he causes his wife Laura
(Isabella Rossellini), and speaks
matter of factly about things
like the decapitation of his busi-

‘ ness partner in the crash. He

tests his newfound immortality
by placing himself in life threat-
ening situations. I

A Airline psychologist Dr.
Perlman (john Turturro) intro-
duces him to Carla (Rosie
Perez), who lost her toddler
son in the crash and whose
pain has rendered her practical-
ly catatonic. They become spiri-
tual friends and help each other
deal with their traumatic experi-
ences.

Fearless is darn befuddling,
perhaps due to it’s nearly com-
plete alienation of the audi-
ence. First of all, Max’s charac-
ter is difficult to identify with,
as his continual testing of his
mortality by doing things such
as eating strawberries that he
has a deadly allergy to make

him seem like a selfish jerk.

The film’s intent is further
confused in it’s portrayal of Dr.
Perlman. In the above scene he
is shown as a bumbling, nearly
idiotic person who seems to
enjoy watching these people
break down. However, else-
where in the film he seems to
be caring and competent. His
character is as confusing as the
movie itself, which seems to be
trying unsuccessfully "to make
some kind of comment on the
effectiveness of therapy.

Also, the film often seems to
be little more than a display for
random emotional anguish. In
the scene where crash survivors
undergo group therapy, each
person relates thier particular
horrible story, often weeping
openly. This is very uncornfort-
able to watch as the point of
hearing these stories is not evi-
dent. Instead of adding up to a
collective insight into the
human grieving process, they
seem to be disjointedly jammed
in anecdotes of pain coming
from characters we only see
once.

A similar alienating effect

s~:
occurs in the scenes of the actu-
al crash. The camera circles the
carnage in slow motion as peo-
ple are ripped from their seats
screaming and the plane splits
apart in a huge fireball. This

goes on for an annoyingly long
time and seems at first horribly

 

self-indulgent -and then ridicu-
lous as Jeff Bridges’ eyeball
appears in the-corner of the
screen and creeps across to the
other side. Once again, trying
to discern a purpose in all this is
completely ﬂabbergasting.
Presumably, Peter Weir set
out to make a film that was
inspiring and life affirming, but
Max’s new sense of being alive
is never transmitted to the audi-
ence. Weir wraps the story up
with yet another strawberry eat-
ing incident. Granted, strawber-
ries are juicy and delicious, but
as a symbol to provide a sense

Lasher
Written By Ann -Rice
opf

Alfred A.

“They’re back!” The Mayfair
witches, their personal dae-
mon, Lasher and the secret
society, the Talamansca, have
returned for another adventure
in‘ Anne Rice’s. latest novel,
Lasher. Filled with incest, near
incest, and more incest, Lasher
continues the story of the
Mayfair clan introduced in
Rice’s 1990 novel, The Witching
Hour. ‘

Noted for her Vampire chron-
icles, Rice attempts to create a
similar epic; however, Lasher
lacks the bite. Unlike her previ-
ous works, the novel seems
disjointed from its predeces-
sor. While about half of Lasher
can be understood without any
knowledge of_The Witching
Hour, the other half will be
totally incomprehensible.

The story of Lasher, a pagan
daemon, hinted at in the last
chapter of “The Witching
Hour,” occupies the most of

main

cmn rice's
look at
mythic
religions

Lasher’s pages. Just as Queen
of the Damned gives the read-
er a comprehensive of origins
of vampires, weaving together
Egyptian, pagan and post-
pagan mythology, Lasher
examines the origins of a mys-
terious spirit, ﬁrmly grounded
in pre-Christian mythology.
Perhaps the most interesting

part of Lasher, like most of_

Rice’s books, are these exami-

nations of religious and spiri-
tual myths, grounded in pagan
religions that reappear in the
trappings of Christianity. .

Rice’s -universe is firmly
planted in the non-Christian
world, creating an interesting
tension that characterizes her
works. In The Vampire Lestat,
Rice creates this tension by
placing her vampires in the
Christianity of medieval
Europe. In Lasher, Rice creates
the tension by placing pagan
daemons in the clothes of
Christian saints.

Lasher’s identity crisis is
firmly rooted in this conﬂict
between the Christian “good”
and the pagan “evil”. Or is it
vice-versa? Thisis something
the reader has to decide.

While on the surface, Lasher

. is an entertaining read, the

more thoughtful reader who is
familiar with Rice’s work will
find Lasher more rewarding as
another chapter in Rice’s cri-
tique of mythic religions, such
as Christianity.

Come On Feel The lenzon/neads
The Lemonheads

- Atlantic Records

Here’s the question of the
day: what do Rick James,
Belinda Carlisle. Juliane Hatfield
and Nigel Tufnell have in com-
mon?

All former or current cell-
mates? No. Close, but no.

All four have lent some hand
in the new Lemonheads LP,
Come On Feel The Lemon/9ez.za’s.

This sixth release from the
growing Boston band that
recorded a very impressive
cover of Simon and Garfunkefs
“Mrs. Robinson” on their ‘92
chart—busting album Itis‘ A
Shame About Ray features the
eclectic ménage—a—trois of pop
diva Carlisle, independent artist
Hatfield and the sado—masochis—
tic feel of James, funk’s bad boy.
Does it work? More often than
not, yes. '

The Lemonheads, a trio fea-
turing bassist Nic Dalton, drum-
mer David Ryan and lead vocal-
ist/lead guitarist Evan Dando,
has enjoyed a fair amount of
success in the previous three
years, topping out with It’s A
Shame... after reaching the top
ten on U.S. alternative album
charts with their 1990 release
Lovey. .

Their continued popularity
has grown since their formation
seven years ago at Boston’s
Commonwealth School and
should continue with this
extremely playable album.

ture strong guitar licks to give a
palatable, rockin-ish melange.
They are both two of the more
rougher-edged songs on the
album that retain a rockin’, col-
lege—frat—party ﬂavor.

Carlis1e’s track, “1’ll Do It
Anyway,” was written for the
purpose of getting the former
front woman of the Go—Go’s on
the album. It is a spirited, anti-
anti song, full of “You_’re—not-
the-boss—of—me” lines: “I’ll do it
anyway no matter what they
feel/Ain’t got all the facts but I
got a hunch and I know the
deal.”

It finishes with its hands ﬁrm-
ly planted on its hips: “I’m still a
girl and it’s just a horse and I got
the reigns.”

James lends virtually nothing
to “Rick James Style”, a slower,
re—worked version of the
album’s seventh track, “Style.”

‘ lence.” An acoustically-driven
guitar underlies Sneaky Pete
Kleinow steel—guitar, adding an
eerie, twangy melody to
Dando’s melancholic vocals:
“Take a look into some big gray
eyes and ask yourself you
wanna make ‘em cry/I’m gonna
ask you why either way you got
a bone to pick/Can’t you leave
that to somebody else/ And I
don’t need you to suck my d—
or help me feel good about
myself.”

“Being Around” chimes in as
the band’s
hippy/country/poppy track on
Come On Feel... It, as Dando .
describes, is a children’s song,
“sort of about ambiguity.”
Dando asks “If I were your
body, would you still wear
clothes?/If I were a booger,
would you blow‘ your
nose?/Would you keep it,
would you eat it, I’m just trying
to give myself a reason‘ for
being around.”

Tufnell, he of Originals, New
Originals and Spinal Tap fame,
lays a heavy dose of inﬂuence
on Dando’s “The jello Fund”, a
melodic piano instrumental
deriving from the former Tap
lead guitarists famous “Lick My
Love Pump.” The key, of
course, is D minor —— the sad-
dest of all keys.

Come On Feel The
Lemonheads is worth what it’s
worth: neither too dark nor too
poppy, it finds a happy medium
in the grey area, and even suc-
ceeds in avoiding the mistakes
of a couple of bad tunes. It’s
good top-down, drivin’ music

stoned/Don’t wanna get
stoned/But I‘don’t wanna not
get stoned/Not gonna come
‘round/I don’t wanna come
down/I just want one killer line
and I’ll figure it out myself.”

“It’s About Time,” a gentle
ballad written for Hatﬁeld, also
graces the new album. A long-
time Lemonhead collaborator,
she sings on six tunes and
speaks on a seventh.

“I think it’s just from knowing
each other for six years or so,”
Dando said. “\X7e’Ve been
through a lot of ‘the same things
together and played together in
many different ways. So she can
come into the studio, and when
I say ‘do it like that,’ she knows
what I mean.”

The ‘Head’s first release off
Come On  is a Love Positions
cover called “Into Your Arms,” a
catchy, folk—inﬂuer1ced cut that,
for good reason, rolls around in
your head for an extra couple of
days. “The Robyn St. Clare clas-
sic,” as Dando says, has
received moderate airtime on
MTV and possesses the pop—ﬂa—
vor that plays nationally. “I
know a place where I can go
when I’m alone/Into your amis
I go,” Dando sings. “I know a
place that’s safe and warm from
the crowd/Into your arms.”

The trio enters with apair of
country-inﬂuenced tunes, “Big
Gay Heart» and «Being Amundy and could spin around in tape

League when organized black
baseball could at times outdraw
its white counterpart in some
cities. .

With Jackie Robinson all this
ended. While the negro leagues
meant black owners, black fans,
and black players coming
together, integration meant
black players entertaining white
fans and earning money for
white owners, according to
Kings. For playwright August-
Wilson it was like, “we had our
everything until integration and
now we got our nothin’."

Monte Irvin, who went from
black Newark Eagles to star
with the New York Giants, says
in Kings that despite the talent
of the players who did make it
into the white major leagues the

base, watch Josh Gibson, the
most prolific home run hitter in
negro league history, try and
often outdo Babe Ruth himself.
We could have seen Oscar
Charleston, the black Ty Cobb,
or as Kings notes Ty Cobb
could easily have been the
white Oscar Char_1eston, and

-“Cool Papa” Bell run the bases.

As for Bell, according to Satchel
Paige, "That man was so fast he

could turn out the light and
jump in bed before the room
got dark.” Roommates on a
barnstorming tour, Bell once
found that the light switch in
their hotel room had a slight
delay so he watched for Satch to
walk in and pulled the stunt off
for him. Of course that broke
Satch up pretty good since he’d
been telling that story for years.
The unfortunate reality is that
the likes of Bell and so many
others live on only in stories
and anecdotes like this, that
these players and the game
itself was denied their talent
because we live in a nation‘
populated by far too many big-
ots. Perhaps Giamatti was right
and re—examining this history
can allowus to recapture its

glory and keep us from repeat— ‘

CASE

D Asbestos
Continued from page 1

Zolyak said that Pitt
has typically had a good

working relationship
with the Allegheny
County Health
Department.

“We have had other
occurrences concerning
asbestos in the past with
the University of
Pittsburgh,” he said.

“Pitt workers are pro-
fessionals and do a fine
job.”

According to the
Allegheny County Health
Department, three specif-
ic diseases have
been linked _t_o asbestos
exposure: asbestoses,
(a fibrous scarring of
—- the lungs), lung cancer
and mesothelioma, a
cancer of the lining of
the chest or abdominal
Cavity.

These diseases do not
develop immediately after
inhalation of asbestos
fibers, the symptoms may
develop in 20 or more

years.
- ‘ The more asbestos a
person inhales, the

greater the risk of devel-
oping an asbestos—related
disease. There is an
increasing concern for
the health and safety
of construction, renova-
tion, and building mainte-
nance personnel because
of possible periodic expo-
sure to elevated levels
of asbestos fibers
while performing their
jobs.

Asbestos fibers can be
found nearly everywhere
in our environment, usu-
ally at very low levels.

“The health board has
scheduled a meeting with
Pitt to discuss these
issues,” Zolyak said. “The
main concern is notto
have this happen again.”

“I will be able to expand on my
projects such as the student dis-
count service,” ‘Foner said. “My
computer survey system is
already in place to ﬁnd out con-
cerns of the student body.”

Herman, .who. heads the
Students United for Responsible
Government (SURG) ticket, said
the board needs a fresh look.
According to ‘Herman, from his
experience with certain groups
associated with SGB, such as
Freshman Council, there is a lack
of organization.

“There is a better way than the
way things are being done
now," Herman said. “I can work
more efficiently with the
resources currently available to
the SGB.” ‘

“There is no way you can
expect to completely change part
of SGB and make it better than it

_currently is,” Moody said, refer-

ring to Hermanfs comments
about possible structurally
changes. Moody, who said mini-
mal changes are needed to the
SGB structure, is running on a
platform emphasizing continued

 

safety and pushing for anti-loiter-
ing laws.

Pasquale said he would like to‘

see the SGB be more in touch
with Pitt students. .

“Just because students don’t go
to room 639 in the [William Pitt
Union] and express their con-
cerns doesn’t give SGB the right
to spend students’ money as they
please,” Pasquale said. “We need
programs_to get in touch with the
students.” D

Scerbo said, as president, he
would primarily look out for the
interests of students. “The SGB is
in a position where it can facili-
tate student groups who want to
get something accomplish-
ed,” Scerbo said.

According to Scerbo, he aims

‘to involve specific groups in

working with SGB.

“I’ve heard engineering stu-
dents refer to the ‘University of
Benedum Hall’,” Scerbo said.
“Thereare a lot of things we
should be proud of at Pitt, but we
should get more people involved
by increasing communication.”

Munkatchy, whose idea for a
Student Health Task Force is one

of the more detailed platforms,
said the SGB under her presiden-
cy would be a productive one.
According to Munkatchy, she will
expect the SGB to strive to com-
plete projects as she did during

1995.

“I will demand results and set
deadlines for the board mem-
bers,” Munkatchy said. “I will
expect to effort and progress
from everyone.”

Answer the question

“Other than a lack of communication between the
Student Government Board and the student community,
what do you feel ‘is the biggest problem facing all Pitt
students and what is one concrete action you will take
to combat the problem?”

This was the question posed to all 14 SGB board can-
didates last night by The Pitt News. All that was asked of
the candidates was to name the single largest problem
of this campus and one action they planned to take to
improve the problem.

But apparently many of those running for board gross-
ly misunderstood the question or were unable to stray
from their printed platforms.Candidates dodged the

guestion by automatically stating that yes they think

safety and open lines or communication are important,
but so is everything else on their platform. This then led
into a full—ﬂedged speech on how overly qualiﬁed each
and every candidate is, because either they’re already
involved in SGB, they’re a Resident Assistant, they’ve
worked in Admissions and Financial Aid or the office of
New Student Programs or they simply have the best
gauge of what Pitt students want.

We’re not saying past experience isn’t important — it
is to a degree. But the focus now should be on what
candidates can specifically do for the student popula-
tion.

We question how these candidates will be able to
directly address the needs of over 10,000 students when
many are unable to directly answer one question. If
these student “leaders” cannot formulate opinions on
specific issues without referring to platform generalities

and rhetoric, are they truly qualiﬁed to represent the

voice of all Pitt undergraduates? '

Instead of memorizing their platforms word for word,
it’s time‘ for these candidates to wake up and learn’
about some other aspects of the university so they can
truly serve the students as they all claim they want to
do. Memorized answers won’t work when you’re the
‘Student representative at administrative meetings.

We are in no way endorsing any candidates or ruling
out those who dodged the questions (the majority).
Over the next three weeks of campaigning, we hope
the candidates will try and come to a clearer grasp of
the issues and what can be done about them so they
can add some depth to their answers.’ All candidates did
touch on important issues, but they lack in their abilities
to ‘stray from pre-planned statements. A

The election is off to a good start, but students deserve
to know more specifics of the candidates. We strongly
urge the candidates to participate in. another open
forum later in the ‘campaign to prove they are qualified
to represent the student body. And tothe board candi-
dates, you have three weeks — prove you’re serious
about representing students by learning some facts
about what" you can realistically do as aboard member
rather than spouting the rhetoric we heard last night.

Visit BAS office

As member of the BAS, I am
very offended by the comments
made by Ms. Michelle Joy
Babkes (Pitt News, Oct. 20). She
made the comment that she was
told that she might “not be wel-
come[d]” to come into the BAS
office if a lot of people was
there.

The fact of the matter is
African-American people .‘have
been spiedvon by White people
from the time of slavery.

What most African-American
people challenge is the right to
have just one meeting and/or
function without White people
present. Which is, as Ms.
Babkes should know, due to
the lack of trust on the part of
White people. As, the saying
goes, “two Black people are a
riot.”

And to add another point, the
BAS, in my opinion, has never
turned away any White person
(or anybody) who was general-
ly concerned about joining or
getting information about the
organization.

So, to Ms. Babkes, I challenge

_'yo.u to go to the BAS office and

make your own opinion! If you
don’t like it, don’t go back and I
apologize. But if you do, your
membership would be apology
enough.

NAFTA not bad

I am tired of hearing how
NAFTA will ruin the American
economy. Will the student body
wake up? This is our generation
the bill could benefit! I

Basic economics says that
coastal areas build economies
on fishing. Wide open, fertile
areas farm.

Why? Because it’s cheaper
and makes more sense that
way!

LETTERS

Mexico has a huge labor
resource! Why not employ it?
Why not help build their econo-
my?

The theory of comparative
advantage states that when a
country specializes in the pro-
duction of a good for which it
has an abundant resources - or
an “advantage” — it will produce
it more cheaply. Therefore,
when it trades with other coun-
tries who also specialize, it will

buy and sell cheaper goods,

and everyone will be better off
for it. _ A

I’m no_t advocating exploiting
the Mexicans. Employing them
does not need to go hand in

hand with exploitation.
Measures should be taken to
keep practices ethical.

Exploitation is another issue
entirely and should be separat-
ed from the argument concem—
ing free trade.

Let’s stop the hypocrisy.

Would any of us choose to buy .

a more expensive good over a

cheaper one of the same quali-

W?‘

I doubt it. Yet that’s where
We’re headed if we stop this
bill. -

Now to the argument every-
one’s able to rattle off. “It will
cost us American jobs. It already
has.”

Of course it will. Technology
is changing the composition of
the American economy. But that
began long before NAFTA was
proposed. Stopping this bill
won’t stop the substitution of
machine power for man power
in our country.

The reality is, NAFTA will
bring us jobs, too. What do you
think these people will do with
their wages when more U.S.
companies set up Mexican-
based factories? Continue to live
as they do now?

No, they’ll spend. It will boost
the market for our goods
tremendously.

And if we don’t open our
ports to Mexico freely, someone

else will gain the market. We’ve

got nothing to lose. We’re look-
ing opportunity in the face and
arguing over the inevitable loss‘
of blue-collar jobs.

Let’s instead do something
good for the North American
economy. NAFTA is NOT a bad
idea.

Outlaw guns
Recently, The Pitt News has

been printing articles express-
ing opposition to Councilman

Wagner’s proposed ban on _

assault weapons in the city of
Pittsburgh.

These writers keep using old
arguments that simply don’t
work anymore.

”Bureaucratic legislation is
not the panacea for social prob-
lems”. Quit using lawyerly crap,
we are talking about human life
here! If this bill saves ONE life,
it is worth it.

“(Name of city here) has
some of the toughest gun laws
in the country and their murder
rate is rising.” That is because
you can get guns outside the
city limits. That is why Congress
should pass this law.

“Criminals get their guns from
the black market, they don’t
buy weapons from gun stores.”
_Talk to John Hinkley.

“Outlawing alcohol and drugs
hasn’t stopped their sales, it
won’t with guns either.” You

can’t compare these issues..

Why? Because if I buy Alcohol

and Drugs, I am choosing to ‘

destroy my own life.

With Smith and Wesson,\

somebody else is choosing to
destroy me.

Unfortunately, Mr. Wagner is
out of office after this year. I
never liked him before. I’m
starting to like him now. I’m

beginning to think that the.

wrong Democratic candidate

for Mayor won.
