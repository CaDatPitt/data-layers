UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Editor of Spin
comes to Pitt
to discuss media

By Frances Sansig
and Sue Washburn

The Pitt News J P _ '
According to Editor and publisher of Spin

magazine Bob Guccione, Jr., ’’Music, I don't be-
lieve, has ever made anybody do anything they

didn't want to do.”

Guccione discussed censorship in the music
industry at a lecture sponsored by PPC last night.
The PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) was
supposed to attend to participate in a debate,
”but they wimped out at the last minute for

something like the 8th time in a row,” said '

Guccione. _

He read from several previously published
editorials he wrote, stating that he feels ”there
is probably relationship between progress and
resistance  The people who want censorship
must have ignorant motives.”

He said although he wro.te thata year ago, - -
he still feels it is valid today, and that once you '

start to penetrate the notion of artistic expres-
sion, there is no limit to what you can dissect
as being evil.

”You can't have a little bit of censorship, just
like you can't be a littl-e pregnant,” said
Guccione. S
’ He said-that the PMRC is clever enough to
attack the issue from an emotional level, rather
than the intellectual stance he prefers.

Guccione also stated that the contention often
made by those who support ”censorship” is that
the labeling of records is the same as the rating
of movies.

”They’re entirely different," said Guccione.

Those interested“ in careers in media, he ad-
vised, had better not let the situation get any fur-.
ther out of hand. 8

”Journalism -isn't like it was in the 605 and
70s. It doesn't capture what it did. Rap music,

l\/lorsho Clork/The Pitt News
Bob Guccione, Jr. -

though, is so blithely and coldly hostile, it
does.”

Guccione is outspokenly against views taken
by fundamentalists. ”To them, music is Satan's
tool,” he said.

He said he tends to vocalize his opinions. "I
like making waves.”

. According to.:Guccione, Spin will be pub-
lished again in November, after financial
problems forced the magazine to collapse.

”The future is very bright for us. We are sepa-
rated from Penthouse  Don't be afraid to sub-
scribe to Spin, we’re in good shape,” he said.

Guccione took over 100 percent of the maga-
zine, although he offered Penthouse, the maga-
zine published by his father, Bob Guccione, Sr.,
50 percent, it declined. »

’’Although I never went to college, I read a
lot of books, and loved writing. There is no cen-
sorship in Spin magazine. We make editorial de-
cisions on content, but we don't exercise
censorship,” he said.

He said he feels there will always be an ele-
ment of fanatacism in the United States, but the
cause will be different. Guccione’s cause is to
”inform people who haven't been affected by
the fanatics and aren't yet opposed to cen-
sorship.

Kuntu. Repertory Theater

maintains tradition of art

By Lorey Kelley

For The Pitt News

The word ”kuntu” in Kuntu
Repertory Theatre is more than

_ just a name for the group, i_t is a

philosophy. Kuntu is an African
tradition in which art is used as
a means of honoring a particular

' event in life.

-Since its conceptfan in 1,974,

"3  the Kuntu Repertory Theatre has,

 f through its dramatic portrayals,

 raised social consciousness about

 1 events that have had significance
in the history of blacks.

Kuntu is a part of the universi-
ty’s black studies department.
The purpose of the group is to uti-
lize the theatre as an education-
al tool and to enhance student
awareness of their culture and the

benefits the community by
presenting entertainment that has

Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,
Kuntu’s current production, exa-
mines the exploitation of black
musicians in the l920s. Ma won
the New York Drama Critics Cir-
cle Award for the I984-85 season.
It was also nominated for three
Tony Awards. Ma was directed
by Dr. Vernell Lillie, founder of
Kuntu, and writtenlby August
Wilson. _ .

Wilson also wrote the play
Fences, which has received the
Pulitzer Prize and ‘four Tony
Awards. Fences was set_.in. the
l950s and deals with familial ten-
sions and the aftereffects of the
civil rights era. 4

N. Alice Kindling, speaking for L

the student affairs committee,

said she had" metwith the new '‘
director of student activities, Joe _ '

Cavalla, and was very pleased to
introduce his appointment to the
board. ‘
Kindling also said she received
a report from Vice President for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo.
Kimbo said that it has been ap-
proved that The Pitt News will be
published four times a week, in-

‘stead of three as was previously

done.

Also, dry rush policies continue
to be implemented, and this year,
there have been more pledges to
sororities and fraternities than
there were in the 19605.

' Kindling said the Second Annu-
al Black Artist Exhibit will be held
Oct. 24 through Nov. 18. and
that the Student Health Service

‘ will host its ”Health Fair” Nov. V
3, with this year's focus being on _

exercise.

Phil Moyer, SGB president, had
reported to the committee that
they are still working on complet-
ing a campus phone. directory
and that the student cab service
has been operating successfully.

B|ack'Action Society chairper-
son Monique Sims told the com-

mittee that there has been much \ -'

greater student involvement this
year and that the BAS will spon-
sor lectures by the daughter of
Malcolm X and Jesse Jackson.
According to Kindling, Betsy
Porter, new director of student
recruitment, said ”[enro|lment]
statistics were very reassuring. In

practically every area, we have

exceeded en ollment.”

Porter also said there are big-
ger efforts being made to recruit
out-of-state students.

The next board of trustees
meeting is scheduled for March
3, 1988. .

Senator calls Reagan's approach-unbecoming

Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.,
responding to Reagan on behalf
for Senate Democrats, said the
president's confrontational ap-
proach ”is not becoming to the
constitutional process in which
we are engaged.”

Sanford said senators opposing
Bork ”are tired of having our in-
tegrity impugned. We are tired of
having our sincerity questioned.
We are tired of having our intel-
ligence insulted.”

Sanford said now that ”ludge
Bork’s nomination appears
doomed, we hear cries of ‘lynch
mobs’ and ’distortions.’ But it was
not for political reasons that the
nomination of Judge Bork was re-
jected. It’s time for that corrosive
dialogue to stop and time for pro-
found respect for the Constitu-
tional process to begin.”

Reagan's speech was offered to
television networks for live cover-
age, but ABC, CBS and NBC
decided not to interrupt afternoon
soap operas to carry it. It was
broadcast live by Cable News
Network.

Iran renews attacks
on shipping in Gulf

MANAMA, Bahrain — An Ira-
nian gunboat fired on a tanker
Wednesday, shipping sources
reported, and Iraq said its war-
planes raided a ship near Iran's
main oil-export terminal in the
northern Persian Gulf.

It was the second Iranian attack
on a tanker in two days. Iraq's
report, if confirmed, would mark
the 10th Iraqi raid on ships car-
rying Iranian oil in a little more
than a week.

An Iraqi ‘communique said

warplanes raided a ’’large naval
target,” the customary term for a
tanker, after dark east of the
Kharg Island oil terminal and
scored ”an effective and accurate
hit.” ’

In Baghdad, hundreds of thou-
sands of Iraqis marched in a
10-mile-long funeral procession
for victims of an Iranian missile
attack Tuesday. The long—range
rocket exploded at a school, kill-
ing at least 32 people, according
to official reports. -

Five people die in
body shop massacre

PASCO, Wash. — The lone sur-
vivorof an auto body shop mas-
sacre that left five men dead
rested under guard in a hospital
Wednesday, while police
searched for two gunmen who
had traded "dirty looks’’ with
their victims in the past.

Police speculated that drug
dealing may have sparked the
shootings, but stressed they had
no firm motive. Drugs, especial-
ly cocaine, have long been a

The survivor, Jesse Rocio of
Pasco, said in a telephone inter-
view from his hospital bed that he
could think of no motive for the
shootings Tuesday evening in
Medina’s Body Shop on Pasco’s
industrial east side, where four of
the victims were employed.

He said he and the other vic-
tims, all Hispanics, had ex-
changed ”dirty looks” with the
gunmen in the past, but would

Americans win Nobel
prize for chemistry

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -
Two Americans shared the Nobel
Prize in chemistry with a French
researcher Wednesday, and a
West German and a Swiss scien-
tist won the prize in physics for
a breakthrough in superconduc-
tors that could lead to faster com-
puters and speedier trains.

Chemists Donald J. Cram of the
University of California at Los An-
geles; Charles J. Pedersen, retired
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology; and Jean-Marie
Lehn of the Universite Louis
Pasteur in Strasbourg, France,
won the chemistry prize.

They developed molecules that
can link up with particular other
molecules, a principle now used
in medical testing.

THE PITT VNEWS, Thursday, October 15, T987

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

Editor's Note: The following
article is part III in a series of five
analytical articles dealing with ra-
cial prejudice nationally and at
the University of Pittsburgh.

”Why do all blacks hang out in
the lobby of the Towers? Every
time a white student sees them in
the lobby, they're afraid. So they
ask their RAs, why do all blacks
hang out there?” said Monique
Sims, Black Action Society chair-
person.

According to Sims, black stu-
dents on campus really have no
other social outlet except the stu-

dent union parties on Fridays and]
Saturdays from 9 to 1 p.m.

Sims is responding to the
problem of racial prejudice that
exists at Pitt. She suggested that
now, however, racism has be-
come less visible than it was in
the ’50s and '60s, during the Civil
Rights Movement.

A lack of sufficient facilities for
blacks may be due to this — a
”not—loud—enough” expression of
need. »

But the trend to vocalize one’s
dissatisfaction with a certain fac-
tion of societal mores remains.

For instance, at the University
of Pennsylvania,’ 125 people ral-

lied in mid—June to protest alleged

discrimination against black
faculty by the administration.

Numerous accounts of protests
this summer by the Black Action
Society and organizations with
congruent purposes, aimed at the
dissolution of apartheid, attest to
that.

But another form of protesting
— which could perhaps be called
“silent” protesting -— exists. This
occurs when someone lends their
ideological support to a cause but
is not the type who will lead, the
chanting at protests.

Janet Louise Martin, a black.stu-
dent at Carlow College who is the
editor in chief of the student
newspaper there, fits this

By Frances Sansig

I He had a $25 "beater" in the

basement. He played around on it.

Then, he saw Willie I\/losconi on a

Television special and watched him
shoot his six-ball trick shot.

Sherrill ”J.P." Calvert, a 22-year-
old mechanical engineering major at
the University at Pittsburgh, plays bil-

' liards about tive hours a day now.

”I started shooting in bars when I

‘was Io. At tirst, I lost all the time.
. Then, I started winning.

”One day, I thought I was really

good. This guy I met told me about '

a guy I should see in a certain pool
hall. I walked in and saw him play-
ing, and right away, I said, that's
what I gotta be.”

He entered his tirst competition
when he was in high school, earn—
ing second place at the state cham-
pionships.

He's also competed in the Atlan-
tic City Tournament that is broadcast

on TV. In December, he plans to

compete in the Sands Regent Tour-
nament in Las Vegas.

"My mother was real helptul. She
was the one who encouraged me to
compete.”

Qt course he's seen The /-/ust/er

and The Co/or of Money. ”I don't

know whether that's an accurate
portrayal ot the lite at a pool play-
er, though. It did want to make me
go out and hustle.”

- Then, he says, ”I’ve been shoot-
ing in games I know I should’ve
won.

”I\/ly buddy and I like to cruise this
certain town near home. There was
this big mouth playing pool there.
We overheard him say he was get-
ting paid Friday. We sat on it, not
saying anything for a while.

”Then we went back, and I let my
buddy use my cue, acted like I didn't
know him and sat back and laughed
while he lost the game and had to
buy the guy a couple of beers. Then
theguy said, ’Hey, get up and play
me it you think it's so tunny. I told him
I didn't have a cue, _so I couldn't play
him. Then, m buddy said, ’Use my
cue.’ So I toid him I don't play tor
anything unless it's $20 or $50 a
game. I was trying to act like I didn't
want to play him because he was so
good. Then, I told him I wanted to
see $500 up tront. So this guy's think-

ing I'm looking tor a way out. We

et on the table, and we start out at
320 a rack. So I play OK. I win some
games. Then I said, 'Let's make it a
hundred a game.’ I win the next three
games. I gave the stick back to my
buddy, and we got in the car."
He said he decided to go back to
the pool hall a couple at weeks later.
"The guy saw me and my buddy
together, and he realized he was

hustled. Betorel knew it, these guys T

His total winnings tor the night?
S750. .

He says he's gained respect trom
his colleagues, including triendly rival
Chuck Farinella, who earned tirst
place at last Sunday's PPC—
sponsored pool tournament. Calvert
placed third.

”PeopIe respect my iudgment.
We're a tight—knit group down there
[in the pool hall in the William Pitt
Union]."

Both Calvert and Farinella, who is
ranked sixth in the nation as a college
pool player, and the other two play-
ers who tinished in the top tour will
advance to the regionals. From there,
the winner will advance to the Ameri-
can College Union International Pool
Tournament.

Although he may play pool tor tive
hours or more, Calvert says he isn’t
quite obssessed with playing pool. ”I
make sure my studies come tirst."

Calvert writes a tip column in the
/ron City Pool News and Views, and
now that he's a senior, the obvious
question is what he wants to do with
his lite — play pool or be a mechan-
ical engineer.

”Both,” he says.

Assistant Entertainment Editor

 

Oooo, Pittsburghers. If there
ever was a need for fireworks at

ly came two_days ago. No home

electrifying rock ’n’ roll.

sounds.

It's been over two years since
U2 played in Pittsburgh, and
Tuesday night's marvel of a con-
cert proved it was well worth the

What a show! The Irish right-
eous rock band prowled onto
stage with a back-drop of a
Joshua tree and Bono’s left arm
in a sling (he dislocated his shoul-
"der) and opened with ”Where
the Streets Have No Name,” first
-. cut off their latest album, The

‘U2 reached back to their 1983

‘ Live Under A Blood Red Sky
mini—LP to play ”l Will Follow,”
sending the crowd swaying to
Adam .Clayton’s grand guitar

The band played nearly all of
the new album including the
reminiscence of the War album,

”Bullet the Blue Sky,” a loud and
bold song of political conscious-
ness that features The Edge’s
powerful bass lines.

”Sunday Bloody Sunday” had
Bono singing a cappe/la with the
crowd later joining in to this
1983 smash hit about the reli-
gious clashes between Ireland's
protestants and catholics.

Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. kept
the beat with his steady and quick
pounding. “

The band may look a bit hag-
gard and an unshaven Edge even
looks grubby on the cover of the
latest album. Although they may
have changed their looks and
even added. more to their sound
by way of American Blues, U2
gives a concert like no one else.

Bono unwrapped his bandaged
arm to try to play a cover of ”Peo-
ple Get Ready/’lHe then realized
it wasn't too feasible and asked
the jumping crowd if anyone out
there could play guitar. Three
thrilled young men were pulled
onto stageby Bono, but only the
last one could play. He joined the
vocalist in the song and paraded
around stage, with spotlights and

all.

The song “October” from U2’s
second album of the same name,
was the slow and eerie introduc-
tion for a favorite, ”New Year's
Day.” Here, The Edge traded his
bass for the keyboards.

The Joshua Tree may be the
band's biggest success yet, espe-
cially since many tracks have
been played on pop music sta-
tions, thus drawing in some of the
B-94 kids, instead of U2’s smaller
but steady following of college
and alternative radio crowds.

Despite the wider appeal,
Bono firmly reminded: ’’I’m not
a pop star. I'm a rock ’n’ roll
singer.”

And sing he did. Bono was at
his best performing the cuts from
The Unforgettable Fire album.
He did the deep, moody tribute
to Martin Luther King.

The singles ”The Unforgettable
Fire” and ”Pride” sounded won-
derful live.

Bono’s original lyrics and The
Edge’s wild bass chords combine
for an unforgettable sound that is
so right for October weather: it's
chilling but yet warm. There's an

' Irish rock band U2 brought their political consciousness to Three Rivers Stadiumi Tuesday night to promote their latest LP, The Joshua Tree.

» eerie and emotional quality that
makes U2 sound like no other
band. -

”Mothers of the Disappeared "’ ,_

is a prime example of this
October—ish sound. The song is
deep and moody. One can'bare—
ly make out the words; Bono
sings low, Adam's guitar is light,
Larry's drums are faint. But then,
the whole song breaks loose and
everything is elevated. _

Sitting in the monstrous stadi-
um certainly puts some distance
between the band and the au-
dience. In this case, almost all
closeness was lost by about 500
feet, if you ended up sitting in
peanut heaven. ‘

I would rather see a band like
U2 do two or three Civic Arena
shows (maybe 10 Syria Mosques,
20 Graffittis) as opposed to one
stadium night. But U2 played a

terrific show, and that's what

counts. \

The band closed with ”40”, the
soft, short song off the War LP.
The line,”How long to sing this
song,” was carried out of the
stadium and repeatedly sung in
the streets by the fulfilled crowd.

Wright or wron;

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

Comedian Stephen Wright will
be playing mind games at the Syr-
ia Mosque this Friday night. He
brings his wry word play for one
show only.

Wright is best known for his
numerous appearances on TV
variety shows like David Letter-
man and the Tonight Show.

Natives of Boston may recall
his obscure beginnings at Ding
Ho, the combination Chinese
restaurant and club.

Wright's sucess comes as no
surprise if his appearance on the
Tonight Show was any indica-
tion. He was asked to appear
back on the Tonight Show within
a week of his first appearance, an
occurrence which has only hap-
pened to one comedian in the
last 10 years — him.

Attempts have been made to
describe Wright's personality and
humor. ”Weird” may come the
closest, although ”spacey,” ”bi-
zarre,””strange” and ”some-
where between calm and
comatose” are also fitting.

According to Wright, ’’I have
the perspective of a four-year-old
but the language of an adult.”

Attempts have also been made _

to explain his odd behavior.
Wright is quick to point out that
he came into this world via a
Cesarean birth, which causes him
to exit houses through the win-
dow. It is also speculated that a
rough game of tackle football at
age 11 has left him unhinged.

Wright uses a microwave fire-
place so that he can spend an en-
tire evening in front of it in only
eight minutes.

If Steve Martin can be
described as silly, Wright is

downright crazed. He recalled.

ghteous rock heard by thousands

 

What a way to end; U2 was there
even after the stage was empty.
Talk about presence.

A lot of suprising sounds filled
the place before U2, however.
The song ”Purple Haze” and
some tunes of the Beatles were,
blared to the anxious audience.

The biggest suprise came when__

Little Steven and the Disciples of
Soul walked onto stage, probably
because a lot of folks didn't know-
who they were.

Lil’ Steve, dressed like a mad
gypsy, and his band played about
six guitar-crazed, hopping tunes
and then closed with the title
track off the Sun City album.

Next-‘up were those Mexican.
Sidewinders Los Lobos.

Los Lobos performed ”La Bam-
ba” and ”How Will the Wolf Sur-
vive,”and sang a good cover of
”Evange|ine.”

If you're interested, U2 will be
in Hampton, Va. Dec. 11 and 12,
which is the closest place to Pitts-
burgh that they'll play next. Tick-
ets can be an early Christmas
present. Watch out Deadheads,
this may be the beginning of the
”U Heads.” Or may be not.

e’sfunny

his most recent suicide attempt,
 l was on the roof of this very
tall building, and I ran and leaped
off of the edge and accidently did
a triple backflip and landed
standing on my feet. Nobody saw
this but two little kittens. One of
them said to the other, ”See?
That's how you do it.”

Poor Steven Wright. He goes to
the store and buys powdered
water, and then he doesn't know
what to add to it. Then, after figur-
ing out the water, he put his in-

- stant coffee in a microwave and

almost went back in time.

Wright's credits are numerous.
He has appeared on HBO. US
magazine called him ”the funni-
est man in America.” The Boston
Globe called him ”Boston’s own
ET." '

Go to the Mosque Friday,‘and
try to figure out if he's a genius

.or- a lunatic.

Well, U2 made 50,000 people feel very
warm under the clear, brisk sky Tuesday
night. Little Steven and His Disciples of
Soul and Los Lobos were both very com-
petent and did fine selections from their
respective repertoires, but both bands
failed to hold the attention of the masses.

The moment the crew illuminated the
enormous Joshua Tree backdrop, all eyes
and hands were in the air. U2’s detached
stage presence somehow unified the en-
tire stadium. It was very nearly worth $20

 Former locals The Five have disband-
ed, sort of. The now Boston—based band
will resume under a new name without
the talents of their long—time frontman
Reid Paley. Guitarist Tom Moran will as-
sume vocal duty. As their last hurrah as
The Five, the band just released a radio-
only mix of their legendary Pere Ubu
cover ”Final Solution.”

The candidates for this year's SGB elections were announced
Tuesday. In the past, the SGB elections have had a closer resem-
blance to fodder for the various rhetorical cannons around cam-
pus than to a serious process of choosing student
representatives. .

To many students, the elections meant only a preponderance
of photocopied campaign posters littering the walls of the var-
ious classrooms.

So far this year, however, we have seen that the SCB can
truly be an effective body, that it can make real progress on
the issues confronting the student body. ‘

More than in the recent past, this year's SGB has addressed
something more concrete than the vague "student apathy,”
which has been blamed for everything from decreasing minority
enrollment to the losses of the football team.

It has been refreshing to see a Student Government Board
actually dosomething. We have witnessed the institution of
a taxi service, an adjustment in the activities fee to bring it in
line with demand, the beginnings of a student telephone direc-
tory and a successful push for divestment of Pitt holdings in
South Africa, in which the SGB played a part.

In short, we have seen action and students interested in chang-
ing the university for the better. It is our hope that previously
dormant students will respond to this progress and become
more actively involved in the SOB elections.

Perhaps, with participation of a greater portion of the student
body, we could see an SGB next year willing to carry on the
work being started now. ‘

the younger sister of one of the

she said OK, but she didn't sound

only taking classes at Pitt this fall
to get acclimated to college life.

At least that's what I thought
her reasoning was.»

' really like to be in unfamilar sur-

roundings, away from family and
friends for an extended period of
time. ‘ s _

But then a strange thought oc-
curred to me while I lay in bed
one night last week. I really am
going to school far from home.

Who is reallyto blame for the Moniq

most popular of all, call for sex.
I suppose if you look at it one

less. In fact, many telephone
companies are making big

I money from these dial-a-
something services and this, in
turn, may take the sting out of
some of other service charges’
offered by each.

monthly bill in excess of $8,000.
It seems little Jimmy had turned

bi into a full-time occupation.

way, the concept is really harm-

Recently, I. however, I heard’

The other day, I received a lit-
tle pink card in the mail. I'll -ad-
mit, it was something different.

”My name is Monique,” it stat-
ed before posing the following
ridiculous question: "Do you like
sex?” The inquiry came equipped
with a telephone number. The
exchange was "976/’

Everywhere I look these days,
I see ads for "976" telephone
numbers. Call for your horo-
scope. Call for updated sports in-
formation. Call to chat with some
empty-headedteenagers like the

ones used in the TV spots. And

Naturally, the reaction of
Jimmy's parents was, first, to
figure out how they'd manage to
pay the bill. Second, as you might
have guessed, comes the dispens-
ing of blame. Who's at fault here?

Let’-s blame it on the phone
companies. After all, they don't
have to supply these services that

. have the potential for turning our

young into raving sex freaks. All
these companies are interested in

is turning a profit. Have they no ‘

shame? What about ethical and
moral standards? What about

: truth, iustice and 

 

way?
The fact is, what the phone

companies are doing is so Ameri-

can, it’s patriotic: Locate a need,
and service the hell out of it. Ba-
sic economic theory holds in this
case. '

If this is so, let's shift the blame
to where it really belongs -
square on the heads of those
filthy sex mongers. You know
who I mean —- Monique, Joni,
Bambi and -Clyde, the latter be-
ing the brains behind the heavy
breathing.

I’m afraid that on this count,
parents will come up short as
well. Business is business. You
sell widgets. Clyde sells Mo-

nique, Bambi and Joni. The only L

difference is that Clyde probably
makes more money than you. So,
who's crazy?

In my opinion, the whole cru-
sade to eradicate the "976" dis-
ease is just another example of
how modern parents like to place
the blame for their own failures
on others. '

figure it out, to rack up phone
charges as he did, little Jimmy
(the name has been changed to
protect the horny little bugger)
would have to log eight-hour
days on the phone line.

My question is a simple one:
Where were the parents while
their son was’ having his ears
melted by steamy monologues
and down—and—dirty repartee?
When I was a kid, I barely was
allowed to use the phone for
eight minutes per day, let alone
eight hours. Doesn't this say
something about the condition of
little Jimmy's home life? It seems
to me that the child lacks super-
vision.

From another angle, parents

' will blame the phone companies

and purveyors of dial-a-filth for
warping the minds of their chil-
dren. For my part, this accusation
leaves a lot of room for debate.

Though I live only 15 miles
away from Oakland, I've become
totally alienated from the house
I grew up in and the many friends
Ihad in high school.

I've become so engrossedcin
my extracurricular activities at Pitt
that I no longer go home really.

Sure, I've been home for fami-

ly gatherings here and there, but _ I

I can't remember the last time I‘
stayed at my housefor a period
of more than one day. _ .
So I guess I got what I always
felt was missing from my college:
experience. In fact, today, I feel
so,far removed from the home I
grew up in it scares me

But every college student, n
matter how far away, still goe
home sometime. ‘
I think I will this weekend.

TH E PITT ‘N EWS

Pitt backcou rt ailing as practice beginsi

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

The pre—season prognosticators
picked the Pitt basketball team
among the top 10 teams in the
country last season, but Pitt coach
Paul Evans wasn't pleased.

"It just goes to show, sports
writers indulge in more drugs
than athletes do,” said Evans. -

But the Panthers responded
with a 25-8 season, a share of the
Big East regular season champi-
onship and a final ranking of I2
in the AP poll.

With three starters returning
and a nationally acclaimed
recruiting class coming in, those
same forecasters have placed
even higher expectations on the

, Panthers this year.

One magazine has the Panthers
rated number one in the country,
another has them third and most
every publication has picked Pitt
in its top IO.

And Evans still can't under-
stand why.

"I think [the sports writers] are
really trying to get me now. They
must be pissed off after what I
said last year,” Evans said,
laughing.

This afternoon at Fitzgerald
Field House the Panthers won't
be laughing, though.

They'll be going through the
first of what will undoubtedly be-
come many intense Evans’ prac-
tice sessions. Practices where it
isn't uncharacteristic for Evans to
toss players out for dogging it.

"I'm excited, I know basically
what to expect. [Evans] has told
me," said 6-foot-3 freshman
guard Jason Matthews.

Evans biggest concern going

_ into this season is the backcourt

where Pitt lost Curtis Aiken (14.2
points per game last year) to
graduation and Mike Coodson
because of academic problems.
. Coodson was declared ineligi-
ble for the fall semester and will
miss the first eight games of the
season — at-least. .

Yesterday Evans said Goodson,
a 6-3 junior who started every
game at point guard last year,
may not return to Pitt this season.

"I doubt he'll be back this
year,” said Evans.

Rumor has it Goodson is con-
sidering transferring. Evans said
he’s heard the same, but isn't sure
what's going on. "I haven't seen
Mike for a while and I haven't

talked to him,” said Evans.

"I don't think we're any further
behind than we were last year be-
cause we were going in untested
then, but it's just that after seeing
Coodson have the kind of sum-
mer he had and the way he was
playing, it's tough to lose him,”
he added.

Three freshman, a sophomore
who was a walk—on last year and
a senior with a bum ankle sums
up Pitt's backcourt at the present.

Freshman Sean Miller of
Beaver Falls will compete with
sophomore Pat Cavanaugh for
the point guard position, while
freshman Darelle Porter from
Pittsburgh's Perry High School
will battle Matthews for playing
timeat the off—guard spot behind
senior Demetreus Gore. z‘

Matthews will also get a look
at point guard. ’

"Whatever happens,‘ happens.‘

I have no preference. I can play
both positions,” said Matthews,
an honorable mention All-
American from Santa Monica,
Calif.

Gore won't be available for at
least two more weeks due to an
ankle injury sustained in a pick-

Please see Pitt, page 14

Pitt's freshman class has
been rated as one of the top
five in the country, but Paul
Evans and his staff have to start
worrying about next year now.

The NCAA early signing
period is Nov. 11-18, and
Evans isn't sure if the Panthers
will ink any blue chippers in
that period.

The development of Pitt's
program over the last few
years has"put the Panthers in
continual competition with
some of the most prestigious

Evans in fight for top

basketball programs in the
_ country for the services of the
best-of the blue‘-chip players.
"I have no idea,” said Evans
when asked to evaluate Pitt's
progress in recruiting.
"We've had some good
visits and some good kids.
We've talked to some real
good players. We're in the bat-
tle with some awfully good
schools. A kid we had in last
weekend is visiting Georgia
Tech this weekend, then he's

‘and UCLA.

recruits

"Just to get a visit out of him ,
last week, he dropped Duke,
North Carolina and Arizona
out of his eight choices."

Pitt will have to replace
seniors Charles Smith and De-
metreus Gore and possibly
junior Jerome Lane, if he'de-
cides to go hardship after this
season..

Evans said he wants to bring
in three or four players next

year\. _

For junior defensive end Burt
Grossman, coming to Pitt was
really not a tough decision. V

"I really didn't like any other
place," said Grossman-.

For that reason alone, Gross-
man wears thefblue and gold of
Pitt. As it turns out, it may have
been a wise decision.

-As a sophomore last season,
Curossm'an7 let his talents be
known, some of which include
80 tackles, 12 of which were for
losses, and nine sacks plus an in-

terception.

He not only impressed Panther
fans, but pollsters as well. He was
named to several‘ preseason
teams, including fifth team All-
America by The Football News
and AIl—East by Street and Smith's
College Football Yearbook.

"Burt's a good, solid player.
He's willing to play hurt and is al-
ways getting prepared to play the
game," said defensive line coach

.THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 15, 1987

Syracuse hasn't beaten anybody —, yet

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

So what's up with the Ducks?
The University of Oregon is 4-1
after beating Washington and
Southern Cal and is tied for first
place in the Pac-10 with UCLA.

In a conference in which six
out of 10 teams went to bowl
games last year, Oregon hasn't
been to a bowl game since 1963.
Suddenly the Ducks, who face
UCLA this Saturday, are one win
away from taking over sole pos-
session of first place in the
Pac-10. If Oregon can knock off
the Bruins in LA this Saturday,

only a home game against Arizo-
na State will stand between them
and the Rose Bowl. Oregon ver-
sus Michigan State in the Rose
Bowl? That's almost as ridiculous
as ”Ducks.”

Last week — .9-6

For the year — 34-17

Nebraska-28

Oklahoma State-10

Oklahoma State proved last
week that they, and not Colora-
do, are the best team in the Se-
cond Echelon of the Big Eight by
bouncing the Buffs 42-17. But as
anyone who tries to predict col-
lege football games will quickly
learn, year in and year out,

ANALYSIS

Nebraska just does not lose.
Alabama-24 Tennessee-21
When Tennessee elected to go

for the tie instead of the win

against Auburn after their late-
game touchdown closed Au-
burn’s lead to one, they did so
figuring that they could win the
rest of their games and then win
the SEC with only a tie marring
their record. After all, Florida, Ge-

orgia, LSU, Alabama and Auburn ,

all had to fight among themselves
while Tennessee feasted on the

Vanderbilts and Kentuckys of the
conference. Sorry, Vols. It's a
great idea, but ’Bama will win at
home this Saturday in Bir-
mingham.

UCLA-31 Oregon-22

The Ducks get plucked.

North Carolina-35

NC State-34

Last year, NC State won by a
point in Chapel Hill when North
Carolina failed to make a two-
point conversion in the final se-
conds. This year the result is
reversed. No particular reason
why. V

Michigan-26 |owa-24 ,

The loser of this game is out of

the running for the Roses. Bye-
bye, Hawkeyes.

Wake Forest-17 Maryland-10

If Wake Forest can squeak by
Maryland this week and Virginia
next week, the Demon Deacons
will be 7-0 going into their Oct.
31 game with Clemson, at which
time I would not rule out a Wake
Forest upset.

Southern Miss-26
Mississippi State-23

Southern Mississippi's relation- .

ship to Ole Miss and Mississippi
State in Mississippi is similar to
Temple's relationship to Pitt and
Penn State in Pennsylvania: no
recruits, no media attention and
no respect. But,'just like Temple,
Southern Miss is still competitive,
often surpassing their neighbors
from the SEC.

Syracuse-21 Penn State-17

Syracuse is 5-0, but they ha-
ven’t really beaten anybody yet.
The Orange will pass their first
test this. Saturday in what is shap-
ing up for Syracuse fans as the
biggest game in many, many
years.

Arkansas-20 Texas-.10

Even the emotion of an
Oklahoma-Texas game was not
enough to keep the Longhorns in
the game last week as Texas lost
'44-9. Arkansas was impressive in
blanking Texas Tech 31-0.

Notre Dame-34 Air Force-24 ~

The Irish showed last week
against Pitt that they are not a
team that folds when faced with
adversity, as they came back and
outscored the Panthers 22-3 in
the second half. This week the

- adversity is in the form of 5-1 Air

Force, which in recent years has
beaten Notre Dame regularly.

Washington-27 USC-20

Southern Cal drops to a disap-
pointing 3-3 with this loss to the
Huskies, who were impressive
last week in knocking off Arizo-
na State 27-14. With UCLA com-
ing up on Nov. 14, Washington
has a chance to go to the Rose
Bowl, assuming Oregon will lose
to UCLA and Arizona State.

Minnesota-17 Indiana-16

Which two of the following
five teams don't belong in this

group: Minnesota, Ohio State,

Michigan State, Indiana and
Michigan? The answer is Ohio
State and Michigan because they
are the only two that aren't tied
for first place in the Big 10. Look
for Indiana to join Ohio State and
Michigan as the Gophers squeak
by in a close game in the Dome.

Arizona State-35

Washington State-14

Washington State lost at home
last week to a Stanford team,
which came into the game
searching for their first win, by a
score of 44-7. The‘Sun Devils,
who play their games at night be-

cause of the desert heat, are‘

tough to beat at home.

Ohio State-30 Purdue-7

The Buckeyes have their backs
to the wall in the Big 10 after los-
ing last week to Indiana, but the
Big-10 season is still young. Prob-
ably another three—win season
this year for the Boilers.

Florida-27 Temple-17

Florida took a break from the
SEC last week and routed Fuller-
ton State 65-0. This week, Flori-
da gets another chance to catch
its breath before leaping back
into conference play against Au-
burn and Georgia.

- Continued from page 11
up game a few weeks ago. ''It's
pretty bad," said Evans of the
injury. '
Cavanaughf who has been
placed on full scholarship this
year after some impressive
minutes off the bench last season,
thinks he's in the battle for the
point guard spot. ''I feel pretty
good. Whether or not I start, we'll
see," he said.
_ The frontcourt is set with All-

Americans Charles Smith and Jer-
ome Lane,(the nation's leading
rebounder last season) and
sophomore Rod Brookin, but the
problem is depth.

Behind the starters are an un-
tested freshman (6-9 Parade All- ,
American Bobby Martin from At-
lantic City, New Jersey) and
sophomore reserve Steve Maslek.

"We replaced Tico [Cooper, a
6-8 center who backed up Smith
last season] with Bobby Martin,

but we've actually lost kids
depthwise. We don't have
Marlon [Ferguson] for practice,
who we had the second semester
last year, and we don't have Rich
Carrigan," said Evans.

Ferguson failed out of school
and Carrigan no longer plays be-
cause of an atrophy problem in
his arms.

Also 6-7 Pitt recruit Brian Short-

er, a Parade All-America and.

MVPVof last April's Dapper Dan

Classic, will sit out the year be-
cause of Proposition 48.

"So we're really thin upfront.
[Brook_in’s] going to have to play
some [small forward] and [pow-
er forward],” added Evans.

To Pitt's advantage is the fact
Martin can play all three front

court positions and Nate Bailey,
a 6-7 transfer who played for
Evans at Navy, will become eligi-
b_le December 18.

Still, Evans has his concerns go-
ing into his second year at Pitt.
"lt’s going to be a situation that
will be hard to tell. I think you're
still going to see another year of
transition in the backcourt.
They're pretty smart kids, so
maybe they'll come out quicker
than I think. The young kids have
great work ethics and maybe in

. the long run we'll be able to do
‘ some things we didn't get done

last year."

cerned, but he does appear
cautious. -

A "We still have to improve,"
said Grossman, who feels the
Panthers still have tqmake a few

. adjustments. "We always seem

to get up for Penn State, and as
for Syracuse, it's always a big
game. With the Syracuse and.
Penn State loss last year, I
wouldn't underestimate them."

Every game would seem im- _

portant, especially if the Panthers

want to make their first bowl bid
since the 1983 season. According
to Grossman, the victory ov_er
Notre Dame could be that game
they've needed to turn the
corner.

"We had two letdowns by
three points apiece [the loss. to
Temple 24-21 and Boston Col-
lege 13-10]. That's in the past,
and we can't change it," Gross-
man said. "You're only as good
as your last game and our last
game was Notre Dame," he
added.

Tyson shouldn't have trouble with Biggs 

Last November, after Mike Ty-
son at age 20 disposed of Trevor
Berbick to become the youngest
heavyweight champion in histo-
ry, everyone, including myself,
proclaimed him a legend.

Indeed, Tyson had a record that
legends are made of. He made
short work of his first 19 oppo-
nents. Tyson now stands at 31-0
with 27 knockouts. Now 21, Ty-
son has reached 31 wins faster
than Joe Louis (by two years),
Rocky Marciano (by six years),
Muhammad Ali (by seven years)

_ and Larry Holmes (by eight

years).

It seems as though the aura of
invincibility is gone from Tyson
— that is not a fair statement.
True, he has been rocked twice
in his last three fights. He ab-
sorbed Bonecrusher Smith's right
cross just before the final bell and
Tony Tucker's first-round left up-

- percut without going down.

Critics of Tyson's will say,
”See, he can be beaten.” These
people fail to realize that only
two punches have caused Tyson
to take a step back, and that is in
31 fights. Tyson can also refer his
critics to the age—old adage: A
good defense is a good offense.

THOMAS
ZIICK

The main problem with Tyson
in recent fights has been his lack
of combination punching to the
body. It has not been his jab as
was thought to be his weakness
against taller opponents. Tyson
has gotten inside in his recent
fights, but he has only been
throwing one or two punches,
whereas he should be throwing
as many as five shots to the ribs.
If he can do that, he will be able
to unload with his right uppercut
to the head.

This brings us to his fight on Fri-
day night in Atlantic City. Tyson
will be fighting Tyrell Biggs.

Biggs, 26, ended his outstand-
ing amateur career by winning
the super heavyweight gold me-
dal at the 1984 Olympic Games.
Biggs compiled a 108-6 record,
which included a victory over
Cuban legend Teofilo Stevenson.

Those numbers did not trans-
late into instant stardom for Biggs.
He rarely knocked his opponents
out, and face it, that is what the
public wants. He chose instead to
box hisopponents, score points
and win the fight — which he did
very effectively.

Biggs had to box his oppo-
nents. Even at 6-foot-5 and
220—plus pounds, he did not have
the strength to go immediatly for

‘bit-‘bi:vbrivévévvi-évl-'1-'£"!:v&-vbvt-vb-bri-'£~'&-tbvbvbti-vb'b'b'£-it-'32 .

the K0 in his fights.

Strength should not be a
problem now for Biggs, 16-0 with
11 KOs and ranked No. 1 by the
World Boxing Association,
World Boxing Council and Inter-
national Boxing Federation rat-
ings. His managers, Lou Duva
and Shelly Finkel, sent him to
strength coach Bob Wareing of
Virginia Beach, Va. Biggs worked
on strengthening his chest and
lower back muscles, which is
where the power in his punches
will come from.

In this fight, Biggs will attempt
to use his size advantage against
Tyson, who stands only 5-foot-9.
Biggs, a natural southpaw,fights
right-handed, and it is this that
gives him a very potent left jab.
Biggs does not have a good right
hand, and that could hurt him in
this fight.

Fighters in the past have been
able to use their jab against Ty-
son for a few rounds, but Biggs
will have to have something ex-
tra to back that up. If he does not,
Tyson will walk right through the

,jab and begin to work on the

body of Biggs.

In the early rounds of the fight,
Tyson will attempt to force Biggs
into a battle-of machismo; this is
when Tyson is most effective.

‘That does not mean that he is a

one-dimensional fighter. On the
contrary, he has blazing hand
speed and the ability to throw
punches from unorthodox angles.
Tyson's peek-a-boo style of
defense is also very effective. He

haslnot been cut as a profession-
al. Tyson, however, does get frus-

trated by excessive clutching and V‘

grabbing.

Ring rust may be a factor in this

fight; Biggs has not fought since"

March, when he defeated David
Bey. Tyson's last fight in August
against Tony Tucker was not a
pretty one, but he did unify the
heavyweight division for the first
time since 1978 with a 12-round
decision. In that fight, Tyson had
to rely on his patience more than
anything else.

The fight will probably start
with Biggs circling Tyson around
the ring. A key for Tyson will be
whether he chooses to chase him
or cut off the ring and make Biggs
fight. Against Tucker, Tyson was
not cutting the ring off, and the
fight went five rounds too many.
Tyson will no doubt walk straight
into Biggs without fear of a punch
landing. —

If Tyson cannot effectively cut
the ring off, he may start to get
careless. He may start to Iunge at
Biggs in hopes of a knockout.
When this happens, Tyson's crit-
ics speak upiloudly saying that he
is overrated. It is just inex-
perience in the ring that causes
him to do that, coupled with his
wish to please the crowd, which
causes him to sometimes forget to
concentrate on the fight at hand.

Either way, Tyson, a 10-1
favorite, will win the fight by de-
cision or by knockout.
