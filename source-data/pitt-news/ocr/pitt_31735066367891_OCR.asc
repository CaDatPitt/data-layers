Computer Classes Still Overcrowded

By PEGGY FERRI

Every university is being inun-
dated by computer science students
who see the career opportunities
available and computer science
chairman Orrin Taulbee says that
Pitt is no exception.

Thirteen computer science sec-
tions have‘ been opened for" the
semester’s estimated 3,500 students.
“The students do complain,”
Taulbee said, “and I sympathize
with them. To say that the univer-
sity is doing the best it can concern-
ing the overcrowding is not a
copout.” .

According to Taulbee, there are
three important considerations
before any section can be opened,
money, an instructor, and a room
for the class.

“F AS dean Jerome Rosenberg
provides the money, so that the
problem isn't one of being refused
money as much as it is a problem of
having enough room and compe-
tent instructors,” Taulbee
explained. “Industry is soaking up
most of the qualified computer
science Ph.D.’s, and to begin with,
there are only 225 of them a year.”

Rosenberg agrees that a shortage
of trained people is a serious prob-
lem. He said that it is a national
problem felt by the engineering
field as well as by the computer
science field.

“There aren't enough people
available to fill the openings in
both industry and university
instructing,” Rosenberg said. We
have people ‘filling in the teaching
gaps as part-time faculty and, in
addition, we draft people from

other departments such as physics
to teach a course from time to time.

We will continue to do our best,".

he said.

Taulbee recalled that he has been
on many panels that meet in order
to resolve the problem of instructor
shortage. 2

“One answer we found,” he said,
“is to have better equipment in a
university. Industry can supply
first-rate equipment and the free-
dom to enjoy it.”

He added that keeping up with
the rate at which technology is
progressing is becoming exceed-
ingly difficult.

“I’d love to have $200,000,
Rosenberg said. “Trying to come
up with the money for better
research equipment is a problem
that is sorely felt and it would help

Alcohol P

Problem
Being
Studied

By MARK A. SINDLER

A student affairs committee is
beginning to study alcohol prob-
lems on campus and may make
changes in current policies for
alcohol Lse.

The committee, headed by Vice
Chancellor Conney Kimbo, will
study alcohol education on cam-
pus, the diagnosis and treatments
available for alcoholism, and uni-
versity regulations on alcohol use.

The committee consists of direc-
tor of student activities Andy
Smith, director of residence life
joAnn Woodson, student health
services director Frank Carter, and
director of counseling and student
development ~Dr.
Gallagher.

There will be no student input
on the committee at this poi_nt,
according to Smith. “Students will
not be involved until after the com-
mittee makes its recommendations
because it is basically a fact-finding
committee,” Smith said. The com-
mittee, which first met Thursday,
will meet regularly throughout the
term before issuing recommenda-
tions. '

The committee’s major concern
is to study alcohol abuse on Pitt’s
campus, according to Smith.
Smith declined to say whether
there is a definite alcohol problem
on campus, or what steps the com-
mittee might take should it deter-
mine that a problem exists.

“It would be primitive to make
any definite statements concerning
possible recommendations for the
alcohol problem now,” Smith said.
“We are nowhere close to deter-
mining the scope of the problem, if
there is one.”

The major emphasis of the com-
mittee will be alcohol education.
Most of the committee meeting
will,be “explanatory,” Smith said.

“We will be talking about the
conditions of alcohol education,
diagnosis and treatment. This will
be a survey amongst ourselves of
what is happening,” he said.

“Alcohol consumption must be
looked at from a historical perspec-
tive,” Smith said. “Over the last
five years colleges have given the
topic a lot of discussion. Duquesne
University just banned alcohc'

It used to be that the thing to do
in the summertime was baseball-
watching it, playing it, talking
about it. It was the national pas-
time. Every small town had a team,
and in the big cities, there would be
maybe a dozen or more. But the real
attraction was the major leagues. It
was as though every young boy's
dream was to play pro ball. Few
were ever lucky enough to make it.

Frankie Gustine was one of the
lucky few.

From his earliest days playing
baseball to the many activties and
projects which he has undertaken,
it has been his determination,
enthusiasm and easy manner
which have contributed tb his suc-

cess and popularity. Now, at age
62, along with his two brothers-1n-
law Bill and Owen Gormley, he
owns the restaurant which bears
his name.

Although life has not always
been smooth for him, Gustine has
accepted success and failure in the
same stride. “The sun shines on
you a while, and then it moves on,”
he said. _

When Frankie signed his con-

tract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, ‘

he was 17 and a junior in high
school. His signature ended his
high school career.

“They wouldn't let me play any
high school sport after that. They
said I was a pro. I always thought
that was wrong; I always fought
it; he said.

Profile: Frankie Gustine, Former Pirate

There were a lot _ of hopeful
young men in the major league
organizations back then, and there
were 58 minor leagues to accom-
modate them. A contract with a
major league team didn’t guaran-
tee anything at all except that you
could play in that team’s organiza-
tion, or not at all. It was called the
Reserve Clause.

Frankie's rise through the minor
leagues was like that of so many
players before and since. It was a
tour of the dirt road circuit, riding
most of the day in an old bus, play-
ing the game and then riding back.
“We had a hammock _strung down
the middle of the bus for the start-
ing pitcher io sleep in. That was no
special treat either. I remember in
Oklahoma some of the guys set fire

to the bus so that we could get a
new one.” I

Baseball wasn't a way toget
ahead, it was a way to get around.
Frankie’s first contract was for $85
a month and a dollar a day for
meals. That was with a team in the
Pirate system at Hutchinson,
Kansas.

“When I signed with the Pirates,
«I thought, ‘this is it,’ but I found
out different." Frankie said. “I
played at Hutchinson for a while,
that was class C ball, D was the
lowest. Then they sent me to
Paducah, Ky., that was what they
called the Kiddy League. They
wanted to cut me down to $60 a
month. I said ‘$65 or I won't

Food ForThought

There’s Plenty At Pitt’s Lunchtime Lecture Series

By BETH HOWARD

Some Pitt students and
faculty will be spending their
lunch. hours this term discuss-
ing ethical problems in medi-
cine, women’s issues and the
status of the steel industry.

The talks are part of several
university-sponsored free
lunchtime lecture series pro-
grams for students and inter-
ested members of the
community.

“Ethics for Lunch” is a bi-
monthly lecture a series pres-
ented by the history and
philosophy of science depart-
ment. Assistant professor James
Lennox said the lectures will
deal with moral and ethical
problems that arise in everyday
medical practice. Topics to be
discussed include “Killing, Let-
ting Die and Dying Well,”
“Genetic Counseling and Abor-
tion" and “A Right to Suicide:
Does It Exist?” ""

Almost all of the scheduled
speakers are affiliated with
either Pitt’s medical school or
one of the university hospitals,
Lennox said.

“Because most of the lectur-
ers have had first-hand expe-
rience with the issues that they
will discuss, it insures that the
talks will be realistic,” Lennox
said.

The “Ethics for Lunch” ser-
ies begins Sept. 28 and will be
presented every other Tuesday
through March 8 in Dining
Room 11 of the University
Presbyterian Hospital. The

one-hour lectures begin at
noon, and there is a seating '

- limit of 50 persons.

On Thursdays, the Univer-
sity Honors Program Student
Cabinet sponsors lectures that
deal with contemporary topics
of interest, according to cabinet
member Peggy Ferri.

The Noontime Lectures Ser-
ies, which in the past featured
primarily Pitt faculty members,
will expand this year to include
distinguished people from the
community, Ferri said.

Ferri plans to schedule a
representative from the steel
industry to discuss Pittsburgh’s
economic situation, a speaker
from the biology department’s
Genetic Conference in October
to discuss vital biological ques-
tions and speakers from the
faculty of Carnegie-Mellon
University.

The lectures will deal with
vital issues in many fields of
study, including political
science, economics, fine arts,
the natural sciences and philo-
sophy, Ferri said.

In addition, Ferri said, female
members of the faculty are
being encouraged to speak
more frequently than they have
in the past, particularly about A
women’s issues.

Each of these lectures will be
followed by a question and
answer session. Lectures will be
held every Thursday at noon in
Room 1209 Cathedral of Learn-
ing, beginning Sept. 16. Partici-
pants are encouraged to bring
their lunches.

Attitudes Changing On Semester At Sea Program

By CHESTEREBACKOWSKI

The Semester at Sea program wil
be launched this week without the
faculty doubts that plagued it dur-
ing its first two yearsof operation.

The program, which is spon-
sored by the Institute for Shipboard
eduction, allows students to study
for a term on a ship that stops in
more than a half dozen countries.
More than 500 students and 20
faculty members nationwide take
part in the program.

In 1980, Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var made an arrangement with the
institute to allow Pitt to participate

in the program. Pitt placed five stu-
dents on the cruise last term.
Faculty members, however,

--debated the academic merits of the

progam at the time it was intro-
duced. Among them was College of
Arts and Sciences Dean Schulman,
who said he was skeptical of its
benefits.

“The question was whether stu-
dents would make use of the pro-
gram,” Schulman said. I

Those doubts now seem to be
erased. A faculty committee
appointed by Schulman gave the
program a good recommendation
and students who took the cruises

were enthusiastic about them.
Schulman, said too, his attitude
has changed.

“Everybody involved is a true_

believer in the program,” Schul-
man said. “If the students think it’s
fun, there must be something in
it.”

He said the program allows stu-
dents to travel worldwide and

‘receive a first-class education.

“Semester at Sea is a natural for
us,” Schulman said. “It enhances
our reputation as an international
university.”

the courses beinggtaught and the

contract of the program, a commit-
tee chaired by Raymond Owen of
political science eventually decided
that it was in the best interests of
the university to continue partici-
pating in it.

There is still, however, criticism
of theprogram’s cost. The current
tuition for the cruise is $8,035 per
term, a figure considerablly higher
than the $2,210 per year that Pitt
students now pay.

Schulman acknowledged that
the program is expensive, saying
that there are not that many
wealthy students at Pitt.

with recruiting efforts to have bet-
ter equipment."

Rosenberg explained that he has
been trying to locate other sources
of money and has been successful
in getting a National Science
Foundation grant.

“However, it only pays for a
small fraction of what is needed,"
Rosenberg said. “We’re also asking
the chancellor for some money to
be allocated. I can't predict, but the
hope is that having better research
equipment will help us."

A problem that also cannot be
ignored, aecordng to Rosenberg, is
that of enrollment. Enrollment has
increasetl steadily each year, and
each year more sections must he
provided.

Rosenberg said that he may
examine the possibility of transfer-
ring the responsibility of teaching
particular computer science

The administration’s goal is to
place ten students per term on ship,
and is now offering work—study,
jobs on the ship. The Institute for
Shipboard Education also grants
scholarships.

The program this term is being
delayed one week because the ship
hit an iceberg in Alaska. It is set to
sail this week.

The S. S. Universe sets sail each
January and September. About 60

courses are offered on the ship each '

term, and each one must be
approved by the College of Arts
and Sciences.

Crowded

courses to other departments.

"'.I'he mathematics department,
formstance, now has the responsi-
bility to teach a computer science
class closely related to mathemat-
ics,” Rosenberg explained.

‘ He said that abuses of registra-
tion such as registering repeatedly
for a course in order to get a better
grade may be eliminated.

According to Taulbee, “The
problem is finding enough capable
instructors, but we do try to make
certain that they are all qualified.”
He further explained that- he
approaches individuals and profes-
sional societies interviewing for
more fa(‘_'1ilty members. The depart-
ment was hoping to get several new
faculty members, but only got one.

“We look for knowledgeable,
qualified instructors and they’re
hard to find," Taulbee said. “We
simply tell them that they have to
want to teach and that we can't pay
them the salaries that the industries
would." ‘

After Paducah, things could
only improve. In 1938, he played
the entire season at Hutchinson at
$100 a month, and in 1939, he cele-
brated his 19th birthday on his way
to Pirate training camp at San Ber-
nadino, California. That year, in
September, after an all—star season

with a class B team at Gadsden,’

Alabama, he was called up to play
for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

‘. “It was a great thrill playing
‘with people like Arky Vaughn and
the Wayner boys; it was the greatest
thing I could it comes to describing
athletes, sports writers like to talk
about things like strength, agility
grid coordination. Surely, Frankie
Gustine possessed the qualities to
make him a superior baseball
player. It his 10 year career, he was
selected for the all-star team three
years in a row and achieved a .298
lifetime batting average. But more

than his playing ability, it was his A

pleasing personality that made
him popular with the fans.
Though he was born in the small
town of Hoopston, Ill., and raised
in Chicago, when he came to Pitts-

 burgh, he found his home.

“It's a big city 'that’s like a small
town, you can get to know people.
Forbes Field was a great place to
play. There was a kind of intimacy
there; you were close to the fans."

Frankie has always been active
and outgoing. He was one of the
early organizers of the player’s
union in the Pirate organization,
and he often gave his time for

speaking engagements to promote i

the game. Late in his baseball
career, he took on thejob of basket-
ball coach at Waynesburg College.
Not long afterwards, his profes-
sional baseball career was over.

“I had a hernia, and the Pirates
wanted me to have it operated on,”
he recalled. I was supposed to tour
South America in the off season
with a team that Bob Feller was

Vputting together, and so I wasn’t
going to have the operation. When
I took the coaching job instead, I
didn’t have an excuse anymore.”

The operation, along with play-
ing baseball and his other activities
brought on a condition known as
nervous exhaustion. During the
next season he was traded around
the league to a number of teams
and finally ended up back with the
Pirates as a coach for the last three
months of the season. That was
1949, and at the age of 29 his base-
ball career came to an end.

“Giving up baseball was the

a?i‘v.21r(lest thing Yever had to do,” he

said.

In 1951, along with his brothers-
in-law, he bought the restaurant
and bar. In the years since, Oak-
land has been changing.

Said Gustine: “We used to be a
great cultural and sports center,
but now we're a great campus."

7 Gustine’s has always been a
meeting place for different kinds of
people at different time, even
before it was Gustine’s. Right
across the street from old Forbes
Field, it was a place for players and
fans to congregate after the game.

“Back in the 60's they used to
hold rap sessions in the back,” Bill
Gormley said. Some professors
have held classes here, some take
phone calls here and some have
even dropped off final exams
here.”

Whether he has experienced suc-
cess in business or baseball, Fran-
kie Gustine has never lost his
generosity. Bill Oehling, the night
manager at Gustine’s, has known
Frankie for a number of years.

know him. He’s always ready to
give a hand. A few years ago there
was a kid here at Pitt who was fr()in
a poor family. Frankie fed him here
nearly every day for four years for
nothing." Irene Cowan, a waitress
at Gustine’s, recalls that “years ago
people who were down and out
would come in and say ‘I’m
hungry,’ and he’d say, ‘Go ahead
Irene, feed ‘em, and I’d sit them
down a_t the back.”

A lot may be said about Frankie
Gustine, but in the end when they
close the book, the finest compli-
ment of all may have been spoken

Midland: The Plight

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

There once was a town
in Western Pennsylvania
whose inhabitants used to
thrive on the existance of
a steel mill. That same
mill kept other people in
other towns supplied
with careers and hopes for
the future. Until one day
the mill decided to close
and left the town and its
people wondering,
wondering....

The unfortunate part
about this story is that it
involves a real mill with a
very real town and its peo-
ple. Midland, Pennsylva-
nia, is a small town
located thirty miles
northwest of Pittsburgh.
It has a population of

about 4,500 people of.

whom more than 200 peo-
ple work directly for Cru-
cible Steel.

The announcement’

that Crucible Steel was
closing came from its par-
ent company, Colt Indus-
tries. It has set Oct. 15 as
the final deadline for
finding a buyer. In the
meantime the mill that
once employed 6,000 sits
in the background of the
town. The entire work-
force has been laid off
except for a few who are
kept for maintenance
purposes.

Most of Midland has
gered itself towards Cru-
cible, so when Colt Indus-
tris announced that it
would be closing the mill
if a buyer was not found,
it rocked the foundation
of the town.

The town of Midland is ‘

small by any standards,
with a business and shop-
ing area composed of six
blocks, and open parks
that can be safely walked
at night. These same
parks have recently held
concerts to help unem-
ployed steel workers form
a food bank from which
they can draw in time of
need.

In walking into one of
the two local hardware
stores, the first thing you
notice is the painted
wooden floors. Behind

the counter sit the owner,
wearing a baseball cap
and counting paint cans
on the shelf. A retired
employee from the Cruci-
ble plant walks towards
customers asking if he can
be of service. The front
window has a sign asking
for donations for the food
and clothes bank for
unemployed steel work-
ers.

“You don’t see no soup
kitchens yet,” says Ches-
ter D’Innocenzo, the
retired employee. _

“I feel safe; they can’t
touch my retirement. At
least so far I’ve been get-
ting paid.”

In talking to Chester, it
appears the town has been
inundated with news
reporters.

“We’ve had TV, radio,
even national newspap-
ers, coming down here
asking us about the town.
We had. ‘a Wall Street
joumal man come in
July--interviewed us
right here in this store.
We never got to see the
article though—we don’t
get Wall Street down
here.”

Although Chester is
correct in saying that
there are no’ soup kit-
chens, one has to wonder
if they might not- be in
Midland’s future. The
borough used to receive
85 percent of its operating
funds from the wage tax
placed on the employees
of Crucible. And since the
employees are gone, the
services offered by the
town must be dropped or
cut back drastically.

Already the townspeo-
ple are paying for their
own garbage collection.
The police force that two
years ago numbered 13 is
now down to. eight. And
there is talk about reduc-
ing the force even further.

The schools are lucky
in that only 18 percent of
their revenues come from
Crucible, but the figure is
still large enough for cut-
backs to be made.

“Business is down
because people are
scared,” says Marvin

I‘|!IIII0vAu.JlﬂIhIO'Cr, . . - - cu

Of A Dying Steel Town

Bahm, owner of a phar-
maceutical store.

“It’s the same all over
the country,” he adds.
“They used to call Las
Vegas a recession—proof
town. Well, Ijust got back
from there, and believe
me, they’re hurting.”

Marvin’s father started
the pharmacy business
and Marvin in turn is let-
ting his son work in the
store. There is a slight
sense of bitterness when

_Marvin talks about Colt

Industries.

“The whole thing is a
tax ploy. I heard from a
broker that Colt is going
to get a $700 million tax
write-off for the plant.
That write-off is sup-
posed to expire at the first
of the year after which
they (Colt Industries)
could sell the plant for
about $300 million. And
what’s more-, after April
the mill can be opened
without a union. People
would gladly start out at a
lower wage if they were
out of work for awhile
and the bills were piling
up.”

And what if Crucible
never starts producing?

“We’re not even going
to think about it.”

Marvin has noticed that
alfew of the townspeople
have moved out to look
for better prospects. But
most have ‘come back

because of the lack of jobs
‘to be found in other areas.

“There’s just no place
to go,” says Marvin.
“This is where people
have raised their families
for generations and they
just don’t want to pack up
their bags and leave.”

Marvin has noticed his
own business is down 20
percent almost certainly
because of the layoffs
from Crucible. He
believes that the mill will
be going into operation
and hopes that his busi-
ness will hold until it
does.

“We don’t see much of
a cash flow around here.
It’s mostly been credit. If
it wasn’t for unemploy-
ment and welfare benefits
we would be in big trou-

'ble. But business will

bounce back after the first
of the year. At least that’s
what we’re hoping.”
The same cautious
optimism can be found
among other members of
Midland’s business com-
munity. Martha and
Emeric Davis, owners of a
men’s clothing store, are
also hoping for better
days. The sign in front of

their store offers a 10 per-

cent discount to steel-
workers.

“This has been a family
store since 1923,” says
Martha. “My father had it
during the depression and
it wasn’t as frustrating as
this.”

Martha tells about the
money Crucible has
invested in the plant and
has a hard time under-
standing why they would
want to close it.

“Right behind our
store is what’s known as
the finishing part of the
plant. They just spent
eighteen months putting
a new roof on it and now
they want to sell the place.

These Colt people sit up
in their ivory towers and
take pot shots at the
workers. We’ve just got to
believe that they’re going
to do something with it.”

To add to Midland’s
problems, Crucible main-
tains the water supply for
the town, and if the plant
isn"t sold they plan to cut
that supply off. Plans are
being made to head off
this situation but nothing
of substance has come
forth yet.

“The people aren’t
jumping off the bridges
yet,” says Emeric. He has
adjusted their business
sales to the times.

“We like to have our
sales at the beginning of
the month. That’s when
the unemployment
checks usually come in.
And since we have a lot of
retired people here, the
Social Security checks
come in at the same time.
So it seems like a good
time to run a sale.”

While Emeric helps a
customer, Martha talks
about the town they have
done business with for
years. She mentions that
the high school basket-
ball team has won the

state championship in.

their division several
times in the past 10 years.
She also talks of the com-
munity effort to help the
unemployed workers
whose benefits have run
out.
“Last week they had a
concert in the park for a

Pitt's student affairs department

is concerned about educating stu-

 Smith said not only is alcohol

consumption taken for granted in

the United States but, “to a great
extent, expected within the-con-

with normal functioning and aca-

He said alcoholism is an illness
rather than a social dysfunction
and this recognition has quite an
impact on universities.

When Judy Laf-
ferty prepares for a
race like the annual
cross—lowa run, she
makes sure her bike is
in perfect shape.

She inspects and
adjusts every part. She
tunes and balances
the whole machine, so
it can go the distance.

Because she
treats her body the
same way, she discov-
ered a lump in her
breast a few years
ago.

She discovered it
early. And these days,
85% of early breast
ca ncers can be treated
successfully.

Judy has since
had reconstructive
sur er , too. And she
fee 5 li e herself
again. Alive, vibrant,
ready to get on her
bike and take on the
world.

Judy Lafferty is
just one example of
the kind of progress
we're making against
cancer in its many
forms.

The American
Cancer Society takes
some credit for that
progress. But credit
won't finance our
work.

We need your
money to help us win
this race.

Where are

the Students?

Is there an alcohol problem at Pitt?

While the difficulties that alcohol abuse
creates for other groups of people have been
chronicled, (i.e., housewives and businessmen)
the student population has been largely
ignored.

That’s unfortunate, because college age stu-
dents are the ones most vulnerable to alcohol
problems. The liquor industry targets the 18-to-f
22-year-old age group because these are the
years in which drinking habits are most likely
to be formed. In addition, social activities in
colleges are usually planned with alcohol use
being promoted and accepted; fraternity par-
ties, football games and bar hopping revolve
around drinking.

At Pitt, alcohol presents special problems.
The large commuter population means that
there are many students driving to campus for
parties or for a night at the Oakland bars. The
dangers involved with drinking and driving
have been highlighted again and again, but the
problem still persists.

It’s nice to hear that some Pitt administrators
are looking into the school’s alcohol use. Sev-
eral administrators from Student Affairs met
Thursday to study the preblem and will issue
their recommendations at the end of the term.

However, the committee is missing a crucial
element: student input. It’s a blind spot that
continually plagues Pitt administrators. They
attempt to make decisions that affect large
numbers of students without ever cultivating

, student opinions.

It happened before with the visitation regula—‘
tions, and it appears to be happening again.

The direction the committee takes will, in a
large measure, determine whether it will have
any impact. Educating students about alcohol
use is important and necessary—especia1ly
here, where students with alcohol problems
have no discernible place to turn—but placing
administrative restrictions on alcohol use
might be questionable in merit. Like new dorm
party policies, further regulations would only
fuel the resentment that students feel when the
university attempts to play a parental role.

Hopefully, the committee will be honestly
concerned about student health in this matter
and will not just use the study to protect the
university from lawsuits by implementing
stringent requirements. Students need informa-
tion and a place to go for help with alcohol
problems, not just one more rule or regulation.
And they deserve, at least, some voice in decid-
ing how that can best be done.

Bu

 

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Saturday night, I finally saw the
cult movie that started the era of
leather jackets and greasy hair. It
was the flick that got the “cool”
generation off to a rousing start
and brought many boys and girls
together in true love. i

“Rebel Without a Cause” is the
movie, of course. My mother told
me before I left the house that it has
a sad ending, but near the end of it,
I turned to my friend and asked, “Is
this supposed to be a comedy?”

Yes, I laughed at that great
movie classic. I don’t know
whether it was the plot or the fact
that it’s 27 years old that made it
amusing.

First off, if I had known it was
going to be about fast cars,'fast girls
and high school, I would have
stayed at home and watched reruns
of “Happy Days.” I grew up think-
ing the Fonz was theepitome of
cool, so I had a hard time remem-
bering as I watched “Rebel” that
James Dean was the creator of cool
and Fonzie was only a cheap
imitation. .

I guess the main reason I found it
humorous was because it was so
dated. Other old movies, however,
don’t affect me like that. I still cry
after seeing “Gone With the Wind”
and “The Wizard of 02,” just likel
did when I was a kid. Those movies
will live forever; they’ll never get
old. “Rebel Without a Cause," on
the other hand, shows its age.

Consider the plot: A young man
desperately wants to make friends
at his new school, so he’ll go to any
lengths to be accepted by the “in”
crowd. He does battle with the
BMOC using switch blades and
drag races in a stolen car to prove
he is not a chicken. Sound famil-
iar? Of course it does, that plot has
ben used many times before. So
why was “Rebel” so popular? Beats
me.

This film has one of the greatest
sub—plots in movie history. The
parents get blamed for everything
that went wrong with their
children.

Sal Mineo’s character, Plato,
comes from a broken home. He
hardly ever sees his father, and his
mother is always traveling around
the country and leaving him in the
hands of a stereotypical black
nanny.

It comes as no surprise that Plato
turns out to be the psychotic char-
acter in the movie. His parents are
divorced—isn’t that what hap-
pened to all children of divorice in
the 1950's? No one could blame
Plato for the way he acted; it was
his parent's fault for getting a
divorce.

didn’t understand her, but then
again, neither did'I. Just what is
the point of her being in the movie?

Finally, there are James Dean’s
folks. He has a strong mother and a
weak father. Trouble there. He is

constantly asking his dad for
advice, to be strong, to help hem
make these crucial decisions in his
life. His dad’s answer? In 10 years,
it won't matter. We all know this to
be true, but Dean needed a more
solid answer.

Maybe if his dad stood by him
and helped hem make a firm deci-
sion, none of the events of the even-
ing would have occurred. Dean
may have been called a chickeri for
the rest of his life and never would
have gotten Natalie Wood, but at
least he would have been able to

was his parents’ fault.

I hear that “Rebel” was a big
deal when it was released in 1955. It
still is. I wonder why? I guess
because it is so simple, yet evokes so
many emotions in the audience.
Hate, anger, compassion,
sincerity—all the makings of a
great movie.

But I still found it funny. All the
action of the movie took place in
one day. If I were a 16-year-old kid
and_alI those things happened [0
me in one day, I probably would
have commited suicide.

Was the ending sad? Sure it was.
But how could anyone not laugh
when Dean turns to his parents-
after two fellow students have been
killed in one night-—and says,

“‘Mom’    I I Jﬁp 1,: I 1

‘M?’

Pitt-North Carolina: An Experience To Remember

By BARRY ZASLOFF

If nothing else, covering the Pitt-
North Carolina game last Thurs-
day night was an experience that
someday—-probably when I’m con-
fined to a porch chair—will make a
good story for the grandchildren.

The story begins at the Pitt News
office some three hours before
game time:

“We’d better leave at seven,” said
Scott Dellett, the assistant sports
editor.

“We’ll make it on time if we
leave at eight,” I countered. “I can't
stand to arrive at a game early.”

“It’s gonna be a sellout,” he
pleaded. “I know what it’s like, I
worked as a vendor there once.”

I used my authority. “We’ll leave
at eight.” .

My first mistake; I should have
taken his word. Bad news struck as
we crossed the bridge leading to the
stadium. Regardless of which sta-
tion we tuned in on the radio, Neil

I Spence seemed anxious to inform

us that the stadium lots were full
and that police were detouring all
traffic to the Northside,.

Sure enough, as we approached
the ramp to Three Rivers Stadium,
a policeman was directing all vehi-
cles northward.

“I told you,” Scott said sarcasti- .

cally, “I've worked sellouts

before.”

My words were restricted to a few
obscenities. .
As we reached the Northside,

I cars surrounded us from all direc-
tions, making Forbes Avenue at

rush hour look like a deserted alley. ‘

I was frustrated. “Park wherever
you can,” I said. “Park illegally if
you have to-——I’ll split the ticket
with you.” ’

We spotted a large grass-covered
lot, where I urged Scott to park.
Three cars followedus in, the same
three that left right behind us,
when a policeman with an intimi-

Field HockeyTeam

Ahead Of Opposition

By BRIAN BALK

Procrastination is one thing
Cindy Baldridge, coach of the Lady
Panther field hockey team, does
not practice. “As of now, we are a
month ahead of schedule com-
pared to last year,” she said.

This preparation, along with the
help of key players and recruits,

will pay off when the Lady Pan-
thers host Bucknell in their season
opener Thursday, Sept. 16, at 4:00.

Baldridge is about to embark on .

her second season with the Lady
Panthers. When she first stepped in
as coach of the Lady Panthers,
however, the beginning was rocky.
Baldridge was appointed at the last
possible moment and had little
time to reorganize the program.
But things are different now. ‘‘I'm
definitely more organized now, 20
times more than last year," she
explained. “The team learned from

A crop of eight starters is return-
ing from last year's squad, each of
whom was on a conditioning pro-
gram throughout the summer and
is anticipating the season's
beginning.

On offense, starters Marge Hall
and Laura Rau return. Both of
these forwards will share the duty
of scoring points for the Lady
Panthers. Baldridge is depending
on them to “lead the front line and
the entire team." .

The defensive crew is also
stacked with experienced starters.
Deb Madara, Terri Zyrgarowicz,
Stella Volp'e and Jessica Black
unite to form" an “intimidating"
defensive assault.

“All of these girls started as
freshman and held some teams to
just two goals. I'm looking for
more improvement this year,” Bal-
dridge saidj '

ain’t no parking lot. Get the hell
out of here.”

We left. Quickly. We found our
way to Stadium Circle,'even_ River
Road was closed. We exited the Cir-
cle and headed toward the bridges
leading to town.

“I’m going to make the right and
park in town,” he said. “We’re
never going to find a space around
here.”

“No time for town now; it’s a
quarter to nine,” I said. “Make a
left.”

He did.

“Turn around,” I shouted, two
blocks later. He made a _U-turn over
the yellow line and turned into a
dark lot. Actually, it was parking
for Post Office employees only.

“Park here,” I said, fully cogniz-
ant of the signs that read:
UNAUTHORIZED CARS WILL

  Panthers Defeat

Carolina Despite
Neanderthal Attack

By scorr DELLETT

“I expected 35-28 our way. I
expected a high-scoring game. I
wanted to give our fans a good
show. Seven-six, that’s Neander-
thal football.”
—Foge Fazio after Thurs‘day’s
’ night win.

No, Pitt and North Carolina
didn't wear leather helmets, but the
game was played like they should
have. Panther and Tar Heel fans,
impartial observers and the big
wigs at CBS were prepared to see
the aerial circus of Dan Marino pit-
ted against the lightning quick
moves of Kelvin Bryant. '

It wasn’t to be.

was his car. “All I need is for my car
to be towed,” he said.

“There’s not enough tow trucks
in the city to accommodate all the
illegally parked cars around here,”
I assured him. “I’ll split the ticket.”

We ran from the lot to the sta-
dium. It must have been a sight'
Scott with his bad leg and me with
my dress clothes and hard shoes.
But we made it on time. In fact, we
had a drink before the kickoff.

Then came the game. All the big-
time writers from around the coun-
try had their portable typewriters;I
had my pen and notepad. I felt
more comfortable withthe police-
man on the Northside.

The reporter from Atlanta sit-
ting beside me, calling his editor
on a portable phone: ‘‘It’s 11
o’clock and the second half hasn’t
even begun yet. There’s no way I
can have the story by 12:30.” Judg-
ing from the reporter’s actions, the
editor wasn’t too happy ‘either.

The game was a classic defensive
struggle. Run into a brick wall
three times and punt. Pray'that the
defense would make the slightest
mistake so the offense could score a
critical touchdown. It never
happened. V

Yes, the game resembled the
early days of football, and Three
Rivers Stadium was an appropriate
setting, considering that the
defense played like the Steel
Curtain. a

Thursday night left plenty oi
questions in the minds of Pitt fans.
Are the Panthers deserving of the
No. 1 ranking? Can the offense
which many consider the best in
the country, move the ball? Car.

had about an hour to write our sto-

Hagenbuch

By LISA GRENE\i/ICKI

He’s not out for personal glory-
John Hagenbuch is a team player
and he wants the Pitt soccer team to
be a winner.

Hagenbuch, a senior tri—captain,
is a main fixture in the Panther
midfield.

As a two—year letterman, Hagen-
buch knows his duties on the Pitt
Panther squad.

“Being a midfielder, I have to be
able to distribute the ball well,”
explained Hagenbuch. “I also have
to score some goals. I believe if you
lose in the midfield, you lose for
sure.”

Hagenbuch also knows that it
takes a team effort to have a win-
ning season and he believes this
year’s team has potential.

Anchor Soccer Team

“This year, we’re going all out,”
said Hagenbuch. “We've been
working out more than ever. We’re
getting in shape and working
together as a team.”

“It’s hard to judge how well
we’ll do. It’s still too early in the
season,” explained Hagenbuch.
“This past weekend we stayed in
the games and kept on trying. The
possibility to have a good team is
there. If we keep getting better, as
we have been, we’ll be able to com-
pete with teams like Virginia.”

Hagenbuch is always thinking
about team goals rather than indi-
vidual goals-, and this is one reason

head coach Leo Bemis named him a

as one of the year’s tri-captains.

“Hagenbuch has improved him-
self over the year,”. Bemis said.
“He’s a leader on the field by exam-
ple, not by yelling or telling. He
plays with enthusiasm and is an
inspiration to his teammates out
on the field.”

Hagenbuch joined the team in

’ 1979 as a freshman from Trinity

High School in Washington, Pa.
He says that being on the Pitt boot-
ers has been more than he ever
imagined.

“I didn’t expect to be starting,
playing, or being a captain on a
team that has such potential,”
Hagenbuch said.

Hagenbuch will graduate with a
degree in industrial engineering.
He claims that being on the soccer
team often eased the load.

“I like to play soccer, and I
joined to get my mind off things
and for the enjoyment,” Hagen-
buch explained. “I’ve had many
good times and it’s all been worth
it. Ninety—nine percent of the good
times I’ve had at Pitt have been
soccer—related. I’ve made a lot of
friends and have become closer to

the guys because we’re all out for a

common effort.”

Although Hagenbuch has the
right to be proud of his perfor-
mance on the field, the still thinks
of himself as just a player on the
team.

“No one is a star on our team,”
said Hagenbuch. “I have to work
just as hard as anyone. The new
guys look up to you fora little lead-
ership, but out on the field, eve-
ryone’s an equal. To win is a team
goal. I’m just one player on the

New Track Coach Named

Late Friday afternoon, it was
announced that John Vasvary
would succeed former Pitt track
and cross country coach Mike
Agostinella, who resigned over the
summer. Vasvary, 36, comes from
the University of Virginia, where
he was head coach of men’s and
women's cross country, as well as
the assistant men’s track coach.

During the three years at Virgin-
ia his accomplishments have
earned him national recognition.
Last fall he coached the women's
cross country team to a National
Championship, which followed
Regional and Atlantic Coast con-
ference titles. On that squad, he
had five performers who attained
All-America honors.

In 1980, he coached Virginia’s
first men’s cross country All-
America and in the previous year
three of his runners particiated in
the Olympic Trials."

Before going to Virginia, he
coached for 13 years at the high
school level, where his teams won
at a remarkable percentage of .925.
During this period he coached four
nationally ranked athletes in addi-
tion to 74 state champions and
runner-ups.

With cross country and track, as
well as many of the other non-
revenue sports, having declined in
recent years, the move is a definite
sign to Vasvary that new athletic

This fall, the Panther cross-
country team enters the Big East
Conference, an obvious step up
from the Eastern Eight. Big expec-
tations are filtering around Vas-
vary, and if his past has anything to
do with Pitt's future, the Panthers
are headed for success.

Panthers Struggle Through Opening Game Jitters 

continued from page eleven

Foge Fazio succeed as a college
coach?

Many people were disappointed
about the lack of offensive maneu-
vers in the game, but there were
several reasons behind the Panth-
ers’ performance.

O First game jitters. Since the
game was so important and since it
was nationally televised, the
Panthers were emotionally higher
than an airplane. Normally, this
would play to a team’s advantage,
but sometimes it can cause
mistakes._

0 First game mistakes. Both
teams had their problems, particu-
larly with motion penalties. Pitt
was whistled down 13 times for 97
yards, North Carolina saw the yel-
low flag on the turf 15 times for 133
yards. Neither team will have as
many penalties called come
November.

0 North Carolina's Defense.
Give credit where credit is due—the
Tar Heel defense performed _well
on Thursday night. North Caro-
lina refused to give Dan Marino the
medium-range pass; therefore,
Marino was forced to throw the

ball deep into double and triple
coverage, hence, the high number
of interceptions.

Marino didn't have the time to
look for open receivers as he has
had during his first three years.
North Carolina's constant move-
ment along the line, gambling
stunts and blitzes confused the usu-
ally fortress-like offensive line. The
Tar Heels were able to harass
Marino and tackle him four times
for losses.

“They were as great ballclub,”
offensive guard Ron Sams said.
“They were the best defensive team

we've ever played. They shut down
a lot of things we wanted to do.”

'”They caused a lot ofproblems,”
Pitt running back Bryan Thomas
said.

North Carolina would have
created a lot more problems if the
game were played later in the
season.

Tar Heel coach Dick Crum was
pleased with the performance of
the defense, saying, “When you
hold a team of Pitﬁseitplosiveness
to seven points, you’ve done a good
night’s work.”

Even if the game were played in
November or January, it would
have been a fairly low-scoring
game. The individual statistics
would have been better, but when

’ two of the top teams in the nation

face each other—especially two
teams whose defenses are among
the best in college football—a
wide-open game is not expected.
{here have been complaints
about the team, but fans must have

practice. Marino had a shaky start ’

against Illinois in the 1981 opener,

but he went on to an excellent -

SCBSOII.

Field Hockey Team Preparing

continued from page eleven

Colleen Ahern has displayed
improvements, becoming an
important component in the Lady
Panther lineup.

One major obstacle the Lady
Panthers encounter year after year
is the lack of revenue. The meager
funding set aside for field hockey
makes recruiting a difficult and
sometimes futile venture.

“Giving out no scholarships
really makes recruiting hard,” Bal-
dridge said. “The really big teams

out East give scholarships; Pitt has
to rely on its academic side.”

Although the Lady Panthers
can’t use scholarships for bait, they
still are able to lure in some fine
recruits. One of these recruits is
Darlene Wilson from Maryland.
According to Baldridge, two of
Wilson’s good qualities are
“aggressiveness” and “good stick
work.” ‘

Recruit Joanne Patterson will be
utilized very frequently this year
because she plays the important
“link” position. which encom-

It is vitally important that we all become more
conscious of the counterflow bus lane. p For years
it has been a parking lane carrying no trafﬁc, so
pedestrians have used the lane as a staging area
