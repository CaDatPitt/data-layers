University Still Needs Land
For Proposed Expansion

By JOHN

De NINNO

A

Pitt’s need for more land is still very much a major
problem -of the University, despite the large tract of land
that has recently been acquired, according to Chancellor

Rufus ‘H. Fitzgerald.

The new property recently given to the University is

the plot directly across from _the¢ -

Cathedra1’s Fifth Avenue side and
is now used as a parking lot.
This land was given to Pitt, by the
A. W. Mellon Charitable Trust

Fund and was formally accepted
by the University in late Decem-

ber of 1953. The deed for this

land was ﬁled at that time, Dr.
Fitzgerald said.

He added that it has definitely
been decided to build the George
Clapp Science Hall on this tract
of land. That buildings, he said,
would take up only a small por-
tion of the total land grant of
three acres. However he refused
to speciﬁcally say what other
buildings could be placed there,
but hinted a library was ﬁrst for
consideration. :

Commitments Come First

“Cqmmitments that have been
made by the University must be
carried through. This would-take
several months, then possibly ac-
tual construction of Clapp Hall -can
begin,” the Chancellor said.

Emphasizing that the expansion
program is not nearly satisﬁed by
the recent gift of land, Dr. Fitz-
gerald went on to say that the
University is very grateful for the
gift which ﬁts in “beautifully”
with the idea of a centralized
campus in the heart of the city.

He added that the acquisition
of the building now being used
by WQED, Pittsburgh’s‘ education-

N ext Tuesday

Next meeting of the Pitt
delegation of “the Intercolle-
giate Conference on Govern-
ment will meet Tuesday, Jan.
12 in 832 C1. at 2:15 p.m.

All meetings held by the group
now are in preparation for an all-
state convention to be held at Har-
risburg early in April. For the
present meetings, committees rep-
resenting public interest. groups
have been formed and model bills
will be drawn up’ by them. V

Previous to the April event in
Harrisburg, the southwestern re-
gion has planned a regional pre-
liminary meeting scheduled for
sometime during March.

Between 15 and 20 students will
attend the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Government at Harrisburg
,where. a model congress will be
set up. A speaker will be elected
and bills passed.

Donald Buchek, student chair-
man of the organization, and Wil-
liam C. Seyler, assistant professor
of political science, attended a
southwest regional executive com-
mittee meeting at Duquesne Uni-
versity before Christmas vacation.

Denies Rumors

Chancellor Fitzgerald denied
knowing anything about the rum-
ors that Pitt hoped to acquire the
property where the Syria Mosque,
Pittsburgh Athletic Association,
and Masonic Temple now stand,
but admitted this would ﬁt in
nicely with the plans for an ex-

, panded but centralized campus us-

Meidical SehoolGets
Bequest of Lewin W/ill

Pitt’s medical school received anestimated $250,000 be-

quest in the probated will of

Jackson Lewin Investment Fund.
Income from the fund is to be
used to buy books, periodicals and
other research materials to be

placed in the medical library. The
fund was named for Dr. Lewin’s
deceased wife.

“Dr. Lewin appreciated the im-
portance of a large medical li-
brary to serve" not only the need
of the University but also the
needsof the whole Western Penn-
sylvania area. I have no doubt
that was what motivated him,”
Dean McEllroy ,said.

Dr. Lewin graduate_ in the class
of 1892 in medicine. He was al-
ways interested in the medical
needs of this area. His will named
as co-executors of the fund the
People First National Bank and
his secretary, Florence C. Schultz.
Other bequests worth $7,000 were
left to relatives andtfriends.

  

ing the Cathedral as its focal
point. '

He said the University is on a
constant drive for land and
funds to build the several build-
ings that are important to a
‘large institution such as Pitt.
Some of these needed buildings
are dormitories, student union,
and a gym. 1

Mentioning the growing medi-
cal center, the Chancellor said that
the new medical school building,
for which industry has given over
$6,000,000, is planned to start with-
in a year. Pittsburgh’s Redevel-
opment Authority is aiding the
University in its drive for land
to be used for medical buildings.
They made it possible for Pitt to
get the property near Children’s
Hospital where the Graduate

School of Public Health will be
built.

Funds Still Needed

Funds are needed for the con-
struction of almost all of the pro-
posed buildings, Chancellor Fitz-
gerald remarked. The science hall
is assured of its construction be-
cause $2,500,000 has been on hand
for some time to be used for such
a building. The lack of land was
the detriment to earlier construc-
tion. An architect was here Wed-
nesday to begin discussing archi-
tectural plans, for the George
Clapp Hall, with the University
officials.

CLASS OFFICERS MEET

All Men’s class officers will
meet today from 8:30 to 5:30,
in room 817, C1.

Original Play Shows Edgar‘

«Fl

Is Right Man for Write Job

By NANCY JONES 1

Kenneth F. Edgar, speech instructor in the College, is
a man with a magic touch. He has written an original play
entitled “Magic Fingers” which will be presented in the
YMHA on Jan, 16. It. is a children’s play, free of charge,
starring Mr. —Edgar, and Pitt students Sheila Cohen and

Nancy Carman.

“Magic Fingers,” explains this friendly young author, is

the story of three small children
who are lost in a forest and cap-
tured by an old witch. Sheila, as
the witch, threatens to turn the
children into gingerbread, but is
foiled by Mr. Magic Fingers.

He is a magical creature who
can turn the Moon red or green
and ﬁnally climaxes the play by
transforming the characters into
a happily married man and wife
with ‘three children.

I Children from Civic_ Theatre

The production is given under
the auspices of Barbara McIntyre,
instructor in speech, who has sup-
plied the_ child actors from her
creative arts class at the Children’s
Civic Theatre. She is also help-
ing Mr. Edgar with directing.

Another familiar Pitt ﬁgure
connected with the play is Lloyd
Welden, technical director of Pitt
Players, who has made all of the
scenery and will act as technician.

A
V

No- organization is ﬁnancially
idea which Mr. Edgar invented to
give children a chance for dra-
matic expression. Edgar teaches
a course at the University in
playwriting. He says he picked
Sheila from his speech class be-
cause he recognized her ability for
the facial expression which is es-
sential to the role.
Frequent Rehearsals

The cast has been rehearsing
three times a week since Novem-
ber. Plans have been made to
take the show on the road later to
nearby areas including Aspinwall,
Castle Shannon, and the D. T.

Edgar frankly admits he has al- 1
ways been interested in drama

“Little Black Sambo” during his
childhood career.

“I became interested one day
when some neighborhood kids put
on a play in their garage for the
price of a pin. W'hen Ilpresented
my handful of pins at the door,
they refused to let me in; so I ran
home and decided to stage my own
play. The whole’ neighborhood,
including many adults, jammed

tically out of the cellar soaking

wet. That’s when I recognized
my ability for driving the audi-
ence mad!”

Writes Every Day .

Mr. Edgar trys to write at least
one hour every day. “Beware of
the Dancer” and “King Midas,
Jr.” are original plays which he
plans to present, one each semes-
ter, if “Magic Fingers” is success-
ful.

He has done much ﬁction writ-
ing. To prove it he has a roomful
of 327 rejection slips. Edgar be-
gna submitting manuscripts to
publishing houses -and magazines
in 1945, while in the service, but
has never been published. He has
written 5 novels, 4 full-length
plays, about 20 short stories, and
some TV scripts.

No one will accept material un-
til a person has once had his work
published. But the question ‘is,
how do you get the ball rolling?”
Edgar asks.

Question Answered

One answer to that question
came during his college days at
Penn State. He began the “New
Portfolio” magazine and edited it
himself. Every issue carried an
article with a “K. F. Edgar” by-
line. While at college he used to
take his two dogs and a typewrit-
er, drive up to his cabin on Mt.
Nittany and spend the weekend
writing stories. One of his plays,

produced at State. ,

Another play entitled “The Re-
turn” which he wrote for his thesis
was produced at Stephen Foster
in 1951. He played the lead role
in this play about Civil War days.
Edgar took his graduate work at
Pitt. He is now 10 credits away
from his Ph.D. -

Most of his plays have a moral
in them. The “overtone” of “Magic
Fingers” is that man has to give
up much to marry. Mr. Magic
Fingers has to forfeit all his magi-
cal powers in order to change. the
witch into a pretty young wife.

Edgar should be versed in the
subject of marriage, since he in-
vestigated it quite thoroughly last
June when he marched down the
aisle. Now he and his wife have
a new home in East McKeesport.
He likes to plant trees around the

Stravinsky records.

    How the

Korea Asks
For Pitt Aid

A Korean educator has appeal-
ed to Pitt to help students in his
war devastated homeland.

Addressing cabinet members of
the Pitt YWCA, Taisik Synn said
an urgent need for writing ma-
terial is forcing Korean students
to use old newspapers and black
ing for their school assignments.
Mr. Synn, principal of a Korean
boys’ school now studying at the
Pitt School of Education, asked
the help of YWCA members in a
drive for pencils and paperfor
mission schools in Taegu.

One pencil and a notebook or
tablet of paper is being asked of
each Pitt student.’ The YWCA is
also sponsoring a drive for clothes
to be sent to Korea, and distribut-
ed through Mr. Synn’s school and
a girl’s mission school.

Clothing of all types is desired,
with a particular appeal for chil-
dren’s clothes and sturdy low-
heeled shoes. The clothing, pre-
ferably clean and mended, is be-
ing collected in the twelfth ﬂoor
Y ofﬁce.

Jan. 13 is the deadline for the
drive. Plans are being made to
pack the articles for immediate

" shipment. Response to the drive

has not been as great as last year,
according to Y members.

Describing the Korean educa-
tional system, Mr. Synn told the
Y cabinet that free compulsory ed-
ucation is offered through six
years of elementary school. After
that, the student must pay tui-
tion in the next three years of
junior high and three years of
senior high at mission schools. He
added that at the end of their ed-
ucation, 20 per cent of the stu-
dents can’t pay the tuition.

Mr. Synn ‘said that Korean
teachers are paid 40 dollars a
month—an income supplemented
by members of -their families

Humanities Features Address by Sobotka

Society 1

Pitt’s Humanities Society will
celebrate its ﬁrst anniversary on
Jan. 11 with a program featuring
Mr. Walter Sobotka, assicate pro-

fessor in the Research Bureau for
Retail Training. The title of Mr.
Sobotka’s anniversary address is
“The Classical Spirit is at Stake.”

Humanities Society was organ-
ized at the University of Pitts-
burgh on Jan. 12, 1953 with Sam-
uel Seigle, Col. ’54, as its presi-
dent. Seigle is a member of Om-
icron _Delta Kappa, senior men’s
honorary, and is the only under-
graduate member of Phi Beta
Kappa, the national scholastic
honorary. '

Seigle states the aim of the so-
ciety as, “. . . an approach to lit-
erature, not only from the stand-
point of literary criticism, but al-
so from the historical standpoint.
We try to determine how classical
works have stirred interest in oth-
er ﬁelds such as science, religion,
and philosophy.

Last year’s theme was Dante’s
“Divine Comedy.” One of the chief
speakers of the year was Dr.
George B. Fowler, professor of his-
tory,_who is now doing advanced
research in medieval history at
Princeton University.

Each year the society ap-
proaches literature from a new
standpoint. “We try,” said Seigle,
“to gain an appreciation not only
for literary beauty but also for
man’s unceasing search for truth.”
Dante’s work was read in Italian

Year Old

in order “. . . to get the sonority
of the words in the poem . . J” and
was then read according to the
Longfellow translation.

The theme for this school year
is “Plato and his philosophy.”
Earlier this year the Pitt Players
presented Sophocles"? “Electra” in
its entirety in order to show the
type of literary attitude in which
Plato developed.

“As a young organization,” said
Seigle, “the society is attempting
to establish various traditions.”
This year, an annual music week
has been begun as part of this
program. It is held during the
week of Dec. 7 “. . . because mu-
sic is an international language

which binds people together as
no other language can.”
The society a l s o observes '

American education week each
year. The lecturer this year is Dr.
Armand Carraccio, professor of
French and Italian at the Univer-
sity of Grenoble in France."

Give—It Won 't Hurt

The response to yesterday’s blood drive left something

‘ to and from the downtown blood bank and even made pro-

\

vision for students to park their autos free of charge if they
drove downtown, it was disheartening to watch the pitiful
number of students who had the energy or desire to take
advantage of the drive.

. When the Red Cross Bloodmobile made trips to Pitt
to solicit donors, the drives generally proved successful
affairs. Now the donors have to go a little out of their way
to donate the blood and it’s just too much bother. And we
get nasty glares and nastier (words when we mention the
general apathy of students here to any suggestion of phy-
sical effort. It’s a crying shame that good taste and jour-
nalistic principals forbid the use of strong language in
newspaper work. There are a few choice words that ﬁt
the situation.

But that’s being bitter and bitterness is fair target for
scoffers. What we ‘can point out, though, is that people
really need your blood. You have an ample supply in your
veins and can easily spare a pint or so if your’re in decent
physical condition. The men in the veterans hospital who
are still recovering from World War II and Korean wounds
are not quite so well-off. Their condition demands fresh,
whole blood as well “as plasma and the only way they can
obtain it is through the generous donations of Americans
who can contribute through drives such as this one. May
we-descend from the lofty heights of the editorial writer
and put forth a plea to .,Pitt students to contribute their
vitally needed blood? -The drive will enter its second and
last day next Thursday. Please try to ﬁnd time on Thurs-
day to make the trip to the blood bank. You’ll be doing a

service that no moneyin the world can accomplish and -'

one that literally gives life to fellow men.

A Gripe-

A gripe, for what it is worth, may interest ‘other people

, and will generally win approval, disapproval and a so-so re-

action in varying amounts. This one should be worth some-
thing in the line of parallel feeling. The subject is the recent
price increase of Tuck Shop coffee; For years we wrote
reams of deathless prose and listenedfo the vehement com-
ments of students on what was considered an outrageous

price of eight cents for one cup of coffee. Now the added two

cents has renewed vigorous protests and brought forth
further vows to swear off the stuff in a boycott (or is it cof-
fee-cott?) of the article. It is justiﬁable complaint and come
higher-prices or the age—old argument that some articles

i have to carry high traiffs in order to cover. losses on other

items, we’re..going to stick with the complainers. Why can’t

— some less popular and less vital item be increased to carry

what small loss might ‘be incurred through a lower price on

coffee ?

The editor scrambled for the
phone, “Joe, hold the front page
we got something for Pittpourri.”
He returned to the informer is-
suing orders, “grab a couple of
typewriters and here's a copy
pencil with your name on it.”

Shortly the frenzied reporter
exclaimed, “Here it is, my Big
Story.”

The editor pointed and direct-
ed, “To the printers and good
luck.”

In a ﬂash the informer was at
the elevator door._ He was sur-
prised to see a woman operating
it. Then as he stepped into the
conveyor, he questioned, “are
you going dooowwwnnnnn . . ."

A much better plan would be to

vocate this plan of attack. Stand-
ard equipment includes a large

pan full of ice in which the feet;
are placed, a carload of cigar- 

ettes, one match, and a coffee pot
the size of the Washington monu-
ment.

Answer number three is- sim-
ple but costly. When following
this plan, the student proceeds to
the nearest bar, rolls up his
sleeves, loosens his tie, and pro-

-ceeds to make like a sponge. He

is usually carried into his first
exam while laboring under the
delusion that someone is pound-

Colombian Scholars

, To be Oil Engineers

By BETSY CARTER
“It is something amazing.” This is the phrase Gonzalo
Cordabo and Camilo Merendoni use to describe Pitt’s fall
semester registration system. While a great number of Pitt
students think registration is confusing, these Colombian
petroleum engineering students think it is perfectly organ-

ized. -

Gonzalo Cordaba hails from
Bogata, Colombia, where he at-
tended the University of the Andes
for two and one half years. He
, feels that coming to Pitt has been
a radical change in many ways,
the most prominent being the dif-
ference in size. His former school
had only 300 students.
Gonzalo, of course, expected
to see the air of Pittsburgh laden
with smoke. He was pleasantly
surprised to- ﬁnd the air was
clear and free from smog, but
he says that he has never seen
so many black buildings in a
single city before.

Just as interesting as petroleum
engineering to Gonzalo is his op-
portunity to learn about life in
the United States. He believes
studying in a large city offersfar
more than a small college town.

Gonzalo is now a pledge of Phi
Delta Theta social fraternity. He
feels that belonging to a frater-
nity has helped" him to make many
friends as well as providing many
activities. A

The wide variety of musical
presentations offered in the city
have impressed Gonzalo. He en-
joys concerts of all types, par-
ticularly American jazz, which
he says is simply “great.”

Though. he didn't go home to
Colombia for Christmas vacation,
Gonzalo spent some time in Flori-
da with a few friends. His plans
for the future are to obtain his
degree in petroleum engineering
and to begin his chosen career as
soon as possible.

A degree in petroleum engin-
eering is also the aim of Camilo

.Merendoni. Camilo is from Bar-
ranquilla, Colombia, which is a
sea coast city. He is accustomed
to living the year round in 90
degree temperatures. Pittsburgh's
weather is a new experience for
him. One of the ﬁrst things he
looked forward to was snow,
which he enjoys tremendously.

Camilo arrived in ‘Pittsburgh
last September and was greatly
impressed with our concrete
constructions, which he, deems
an engineering feat.

Camilo traveled to Champaigne,
Illinois, for the Christmas holi-

T

days to be with some friends from
Colombia who are studying at the

University of Illinois. Though Ca- ,

milo would like to go home to
Colombia.for the summer vacation,“
he plans to work in the States in-
stead. ‘

After graduation, Camilo plans ‘
to return to Colombia to_ work
in petroleum engineering. He
expects to work for three or
four years and then return to
Pitt to obtain his masters de-
gree.

The two men are not regular
exchange students, but are here
as a result of a visit of Dean Fit-
terer of the engineering school to
Colombia this summer.

While attending a Conference
of Metallurgy in Bogota, Dean Fit-
terer met the rector of the Uni-
versity of the Andes, who asked
permission to send two students to
Pitt to study petroleum engin-
eering.

Colombia recently began devel-
oping her oil resources and needs

the Andes does not offer courses
in engineering and therefore, must
sent students to study in the Unit-
ed States.

Matinen Host Toledo
Tomorrow in Opener

By PAUL

HARRISON

At the stroke of eight tomorrow night the Field House
will be ﬁlled with grunts and groans as the Panthers open
their 1954 wrestling season against Toledo. _

The match shapes up as a rugged contest with Pitt hav-

ing a slight edge over the Rockets from the Lake Erie town.
Coach Rex Peery, with his lineup set for the mat show,-

is a bit tense, as are his proteges, because of the ﬁne show-

ing Toledo «made in last -season’s°

encounters.

V Veteran Squad

Last year,in their best season
since wrestling was revived in
1950, the Panthers scored a 19-8
victory over the Rockets and went

on to register a 10-1 record over
the season.

In unveiling his lineup, Peery
will go with practically the same
squad thatecopped the 4-1 cham-
pionship in Cleveland last year.

Here’s a rundown on some of
Saturday’s starters: Hugh Peery,
123-pounder of Olympic fame,‘be-
gins his senior year with the Pan-
thers with an outstanding recofrd
of 31 victories against one loss.
Another senior, Harold Miller,
weighs in at 137 pounds and
boasts a college record of 23 wins
and 3 defeats.

Lineup Set

Munhall’s G e o r g e Matthews,
147, is loking for one of his‘ best
seasons in his last year. Charley
Uram, 157 pounds of bruising
muscles, goes into tomorrow’s
match with 22 wins out of 29 en-
counters.

‘Loss _-String
Wow at Six

{After OSU

By DAVE MAZER

Chances are the Pitt losing
streak, which now reads six
straight, will not reach a new
low because Carnegie Tech
visits the Field House next
Wednesday night, but the
Panthers would rather end it
earlier. ’

"That earlier could be to-
morrow night when the cag-
ers travel for the second time
in four days, this time to upper
New York to play Syracuse.

The ﬁrst trip was Wednesday
night when the Pitts took a 74-55
smashing at Ohio State.

1-7 Record

Pitt’s streak in reverse reached
six in this game while also ex-
tending the season record to 1-7.
The Buckeyes built up a seven-
point lead at the end of the ﬁrst
quarter and added four more tal-
lies to their margin in each of the
remaining periods.

Joe Fenwick, the soph from
Brownsville-who has been show-
ing improvement as the season
whiles away, led the Panther scor-
ing with seven buckets and one
free throw for 15.

He‘ now is the Blue and Gold’s
third best scorer behind Ed Pav-
lick and Dutch Burch, who had
eleven and ten points, respectively,
against the Ohioans.

Syracuse Mediocre

As usual, star center Paul Ebert
was the ringmaster in the Pitt loss
with 21 points and the major share
of the rebounding, but soph Robin
Freeman beat him for top honors
by garnering 22 markers.

Syracuse, which -visited neigh-

week, has a 6-4 chart. The Orange
has been an_off-and-on squad los-
ing to the Staters after wins over
Yale, Cornell, and _Rochester in
their previous four contests.

One of the Orange’s defeats has
been to Princeton, also a Panther
conqueror. The last time that Pitt
and Syracuse met was in 1951-52
when the New Yorkers came here
with an undefeated record and
were promptly dropped from the
elite by the Doc Carlson ﬁve, 72-49.

Notre Dame football players" paid Pitt a real tribute
when they elected three Panthers to their 1953 all-opponent
team—-—Eldred\ Kraemer, Dick Deitrick, and Bobby Epps.
Considering all the top teams the Irish played, three out
of eleven is quite a percentage. Fittingly enough, Oklahoma

also placed three.

West Virginia hoop followers are ranting over their
freshman sensation, 6-4 Rod Hundley, who, according to
nationally—recognized basketball expert Chuck Taylor, is
the best player in the United States. That’s a broad state-
ment even if the talented Mountaineer does average 38
points per game.

But the well-known’Mr. Taylor works for a rubber
concern which specializes in basketball shoes, so he may .
be inclined to stretch things a bit.

West Virginia, by the way, is having a tough time on the
court this year, in spite of their towering squad. The play-
making of veteran Red .Moore and the withering ﬁre of sharp-
shooter Eddie Becker, however, manages to keep the Moun-

ties in the ball game.
* =i< *

That football deaths report from Cincinnati reads like
pure double talk at ﬁrst glance. Although 19 players died

in the 1953 season, the report goes, compared to only 10 in
1952, there is “no evidence” that single platoon play inﬂu-
enced the fatality rate. Where or how could anyone un-
cover such evidence? .

If there is any single factor capable of bringing back
free substitution, it exists in a repeat of last year’s high
toll in the coming season.

* * *

It came as no surprise that Capt. Tom Hamilton
voiced apprehension in Cincinnati of the encroachment
of televised pro grid games on the welfare of college
football. Hamiton has always miantained that the two
interests should not compete in any area, but cooperate
in giving the community its share of sports. He can
argue doggedly on the subject. ‘ .

Track Coach Carl Olson feels he has a real gem in
frosh sprinter Randy Watson. A talented newcomer ﬁtting
into a ﬁne veteran squad oﬁ°ersl promise of another top-ﬂight
squad in the coming season. Also, there is a possibility of
a home meet this spring—the ﬁrst indoor affair since the
Ohio State meet the year the Field House opened.

Laneve Just

By GENE AIIOMATORIO
The only out-of—state player

on the freshman basketball

team also holds another dis-
tinction—one which earns him
the nickname of “Stump.”

“Stump,” or more exactly,
John Laneve, is the shortest
player on the team "that Pitt boasts
as its tallest ever.

Laneve, who hails from Newell,
W. Va., stands a bare 6 feet (on
his tiptoes) and weighs 170 pounds.

Good Feeder

Laneve commented that “playing
with such tall guys is a lot_ dif-
ferent than in high school, where
I was considered a tall man--but
here I’m the runt.”

John, who excels as the play-
maker on the team, continually
leads in assists. He takes great joy
in “feeding” the ball to his taller
teammates.

John presents quite a problem to
his opponents with his excellent
dribbling and deadly outside shoot-
ing. His favorite shots are a two-
handed set, which he hits with
uncanny accuracy, and an outside
jump shot. .

Pre-Med Student

His ability as a ball-handler is
a valuable asset to a team ﬁlled
with big men.

The 18-year-old Speedster is a
pre-med student and is presently
maintaining a 2.QPA.

“Stump’s” interest in basketball
has grown ever since he could lift

a ball. At eleven years old he was A

playing in the grade school league
in his home town of Newell. From

then on his interest in the sport .

developed to the point where he
would rather play ball than eat.
All-State in HS

John made ‘quite, a mark for
himself while in high school. Be-
sides being all—sectional and all-
regional he also gained All-State
honors. The West Virginian also
averaged 21 points per game in his
senior year.

Laneve credits his high school
coach, John Robinson, with teach-
ing him a lot of basketball. “He
helped me gain conﬁdence in my-
self and it’s sure meant a lot to
me.”

The modest redhead_chose Pitt
not only because he received a
scholarship but also because “my
uncle sort of inﬂuenced me.”
