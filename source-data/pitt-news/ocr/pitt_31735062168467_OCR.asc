Weekend Forum

By ROBERT ZAVOS

“I don’t care Whether or
not the campus is Godless!
God plays no role in my
life. Whatever I do, it has
nothing to do with God.”
Thus spoke Mahmood Mam-
dani, fourth speaker at Sat-
‘urday’s forum on “Is the
campus Godless?”

With this speech the forum
took a sharp dive from the pace
that the previous three speakers
had set. Rev. Edward C. Biegert
had opened the discussion by
saying theanswer depended on
the meaning of God. “Yes, the
campus is Godless if we identify
God with religion very closely,
but it has been that way for a
long time.” —

Dr. Edward Gerjuoy, professor
of physics, second to reply to the
question, rephrased the question,
“ls the campus more Godless than
the society around it?” He an-
swered, “UnequiVocally, no!” Fol-
lowing this, Herbert McGibbeny,
dean of men, spoke. He, too,
claimed that the answer depend-
ed on the concept of God.

But, Mamdani bluntly came out
with the answer, “I was brought
up in a culture where religion
was not just partof my life . . .
it was my life. Several years ago
the Friday after God di-ed—I was
setting around with some of my
friends when one of them asked

“Is this Campus Godless?”

DEAN or MEN Herbert McGibbeny speaks -at the Parents’ Weekend Forum held Saturday.

me if I believed in Darwin’s

theory of evolution. I said that I-

would consult the Holy Koran
and if it said that I should be-
lieve, then I would, and if it said
I should not, then I would no .”

He continued’, “Belief in reli-
gion is based totally on faith.
God can never be proven. The

rational way of life precludes re-.

ligion. If man is ever going to
understand man, God must die.

“In the orthodox sense, said
Mamdani, “most people are hypo-
crites. Religion is a total way of
life and I refuse to believe that
spending two hours each Satur-
day or Sunday makes one reli-
gious.”

Sister M. Depaul Taylor, stu-
dent, in the Graduate School of
Public -and International Affairs,
gave the startled adult audience
a chance to gather their wits
from Mamdani’s frank comments.
She reiterated that the question
depended on concepts and also
on individual beliefs.

But the audience was thrust
back to their startled mode when
Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, chap-
lain to Jewish students, asserted,
“We should take Mr. Mamdani

very seriously, for his beliefs rep- .

resent those of our best stu-
dents.”
Dr. Rubenstein explained, “We.

Cousins Raps International

Anarchy, Weakness of UN

By GEORGE EDELMAN

In his lecture, titled “The Shock-
Proof Generation,” Norman Cou-
sins, editor of the Saturday Re-
view, forcefully stated that anar-
chy is the dominent condition of
today’s world. Anarchy exists,
not only in our own, but ‘in all
nations and has become more
alarming in its frequency. Cou-
sins suggested -that the only way
to halt the spread of anarchy is
to establish an international or-
ganization which posesses much

more power than the present
United Nations. .
“We live in the most primitive
period of history,” Cousins said
repeatedly. “Our energies go into
things which don’t address them-
selves to our national needs.” In-
creasingly, “Human mentality is
directed towards the debasement
of human life.” He added that
throughout the world, all men
are in danger since there is a‘
deﬁnite lack of “appreciation for
the preciousness of human life.”

ART MILLER. a recruiter for the Peace Corps. en-
courages two University co-eds to serve as Peace
Corps volunteers. The University is rated 79th in
the country in the number of volunteers recruited

since June, 1961. In all, 77 students from the Uni-
versity have volunteered. The Peace Corps recruit-
ing drive lasted all of last week.

annual Ralph Munn Lecture.

As examples, Cousins gave the
enormous stockpiling and spread
of atomic weapons and the in-
creased research into biological
warfare. “Exotic forms -of gases”
are being designed to cause heart
attacks, destruction of connective
tissue, and collapse of the lungs.

Referring to the nuclear race,
Cousins said that we have the
capacity to -destroy Soviet Russia
330 times, disregarding weapons
that will not get past Russian de-
fense. The Soviets, in turn, have
the power to destroy the U.S. 165
times over. Cousins asserted that
we delude ourselves if we crouch
behind a. two to one kill ratio.
The nuclear stockpile is a. two-
barrelled shotg1m,with only one
trigger and one of the barrels
points back at us.

We are not, says Cousins, edu-
cated for survival in the 20th
century. Our methods of survival
applied in the 18th and 19th cen-
turies.

As a cure for these ills, con-
tends the noted editor, the Unit-
ed Nations must become a source
of world law instead of a mere
meeting ground. In the present
UN structure lie feeling of na-
tional sovereignty which rob the
UN of any effectiveness. The UN
must come to provide leadership
and communication in a world of
diversity. -

Cathedral Poets, a new book
edited and written by members
of the University, will be intro-
duced to the public tomorrow at
4 p.m. in the Fine Books Room
of the Book Center. On hand will
be Professor Laurence Lee, its
editor, and many of the poets
whose works are included in the
volume. ‘

Professor Lee outlined two gen-
eral purposes of the book. It gives
University poets a place to pub-
lish their work, and provides
readers with poems that empha-
size the positive side of man. “A
dichotomy occurs between the
writer who is way out and one
who is concerned with fo-rm and
lyricism,” said Lee.

The hour will open with a brief
introduction of the poets and
their work. Each author will be
given a copy of the bookland the
collection will be made available
to the public. .

Among the authors represent-
ed in the volume are Professor

. An Appraisal .

A Look At Vietnam

By Hobart Harris

ONE OF the most obvi- it "because they were sick
ous axioms of international and tired of Russian domin-

behavior is that a nation
should never go to war un-
less its vital interests dictate
that it‘ must. Perhaps the
most entrancingly appealing,
yet least-investigated claims
of the Johnson administra-
tion and is supporters is that
this is just the case in Viet-
nam—that if we don’t con-
tinue -our ﬁght there, our na-
tion shall be thrown to the
wolves.

The explanation of our in-
volvement is that old stand-
by, that if we don’t ﬁght
Communists in Vietnam,
we’ll just have to do it some-
where else. In the Adminis-
tration’s moral lexicon, if
we’re going to ﬁght for free-
dom let’s drop the napalm
on the South Vietnamese.
Implicit in this is the idea,
not always so crudely stated,
that the will ‘of’. the United
States is the only real thing
between the “Free World”
and inevitable domination by
the Communist. The Admin-
istratio_n’s supporters point
to Indonesia as an example
of how our will power in

Vietnam has led to the oust- .

ing of the‘ pro-Communist
government. We are told
by some mysterious process
of osmosis our resolve in
Vietnam has been translated
into action in Jakarta, and
moreover, if only we contin-
ue to ﬁght in Vietnam, this
will lead to a general gather-
ing of strength among all
anti- Communist forces in
underdeveloped countries
throughout the world. Ab-
sured!

THE POLITICAL move-.
ments inside of a country do
not develop as a result of
outside forces but through
the pressures and strains al-
ready present. within the
country. The Hungarians
didn’t revolt in 1956 because
they heard that America op-
posed ‘Communism, they did

ation. The same is true of.
the Indonesians. It was the
miserable condition that Su-
karno had gotten the coun-

‘try in that provoked his ous-

ter, not anything that we .
did or did not do in Vietnam. Q
The idea that our actions in
Vietnam. could somehow have
precipitated the slaughter of

of a half million Indonesian
Communists by the general
population is ridiculous. The
causes for that had to be
present a long time before
anyone in Indonesia ever
heard of Vietnam. Yet the
Administration would like to
believe that Vietnam was a
major factor in the Indonesi-

an Army’s decision to ‘revolt.

The Administration has
got to come to the realiza-
tion that the world does not 
wait breathlessly for Amer- 
ican initiatives. If there are
more Vietnams in the offing,
it is not because the Com-
munists are out stirring up
revolutions, but that the peo-
ple are ready to listen to
them. Rather than trying to
stop a revolution in Africa
by ﬁghting a war in South-
east Asia, the Administra-
tion would do well to look to
the conditions that have fos-
tered the revolution.

The implications for fu-

ture American policy are .,,-
simple: First, if We think we ‘~
are in Vietnam primarily to
safeguard our vital interests,
i.e. forestall the spread of
“people’s revolutions,” we
had better settle the war as
quickly as possible, because
our policy and our goals have
virtually nothing to do with
each other. Secondly, and
equally as important, is the
question of whether the stif-
ling of revolutions isa desir-
able goal at all.

The world is full of Su- 5:}
karnos and Diems, and the
revolutionary’s support is
there for those who will_he1p
them. .

Page 6 — THE PIT'I‘ NEWS — Monday, October 10, 1966

By GEORGE LIES

Maybe it was the Panthers early slip-ups, in holding on to the football and in hold-
ing on to Garrett Ford, but whatever it was that fired-up the team, it provided Dave

Hart with his first win, 17-14.

Prior to the Stadium engagement with the Mountaineers Saturday, Hart was quot-
ed as being pleased with the lack of fumbles. However, in the first-half of the game, two
Ed James’ bobbles gave WVU a quick 14-0 lead. Hart must have wanted to eat his words.

West Virginia’s Ford, who gained 162 yards, gave a repeat performance of last
year. On the first touchdown drive, he carried the ball from the Panther 13 to the two-

yard line. Gary Thall dived over for the score.

ONE OF James’ passes to end Mickey Rosborough set-up the Pan-

'thers’ winning touchdown. On a. fourth down and ﬁve situation, Ros-

borough caught this pass and stepped out of bounds at th-e Moun-
taineers’ ﬁve-yard line. Hart called it the key play of the game.

Another Day

Mouse Roars on Field

But Walks Quietly Off

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

' The Mouse Wasn’t roaring after the West Virginia
game, but you could tell that he was happy. Mickey “The
Mouse” Rosborough was taking his time getting dressed in
the locker room. He’s always one of the last to leave.

From the way he loped around, you would have hardly
known that this was the same person who had made the
biggest play of the game moments before in the 17-14 vic-
tory over the Mountaineers. -

The score was 14-10 early in the fourth quarter with
VVVU leading. The Panthers were in a fourth down and
five situation on the West Virginia 12 yard line.

.In the huddle Eddy James told Rosborough to run a
down and out pattern. Mickey was to be the primary re-
ceiver, but it was taking a big risk. It was late in the game
and Mickey was getting tired. As the tight end, he was also
responsible for throwing a block on defensive end Dick Har-
dison before starting his pattern.

“That was the play of the game,” said Dave Hart after-
wards. “I tell you my heart was in mouth. Any time we go
for on out we say just go for the sticks. Don’t try to be
a hero.” ‘

At the snap of the ball, Rosborough noticed that Hardi-
son was rushing hard. He didn’t think he’d have time to
get to the sticks before Hardison got to James. So, he made
one of those quick decisions under pressure which pome-
times pay off.

IIIIIIIUCCIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIII

“I was supposed to run a curl, but instead I went'

straight for the pin,” recalled Mickey. “I didn’t have any
trouble getting out and Eddy read it beautifully.”

Rosborough caught the ball while heading at full speed
for the sidelines. When he stepped out of bounds, his foot
hit the in. Two plays later J oe'J ones ran over for the touch-
down and the Panthers hung on from there for their first
victory of the season. . -

Gannon in 1962. ,

‘Our linebackers didn’t hold up
as well as we liked,” Hart said-
‘‘Our defense was not breaking
down; our tackling was. Ford
just dragged them with him.”

West Virginia led at halftime,
the spectators who went early
for refreshments, missed some-
thing. With 53 seconds remain-
ing, the Panthers scored 10 points.

Seven of these points came on

their ﬁrst sustained drive, after

six unsuccessful ones. After six
plays, the Panthers scored, when
James threw a 17-yard pass to
Bob Longo, who caught his third
thouchdown pass of the season.

The other three points can be
credited to a successful onside
kick, a bit of strategy which
backﬁred on West Virginia coach
Jim Carlen, and a hard hitting
linebacker named Ed Gallin.

Because WVU would have the
ball in ﬁeld goal range if the
onsider kick hadn’t worked, it
was a doubtful call by Hart. But,
“I’m glad we called it now,” he
said. “It gave our kids the mo-
mentum they needed.”

The Panthers, however, could
not take advantage of their suc-
cess. After declining a penalty,
West Virginia accepted Aldo Zor-
tea’s punch which rolled out of
bounds on its three yard line.
With just 12 seconds left, they
wanted to ‘run out the clock.

WVU quarterback Tom Digon
tried a keeper play, but he ran

~ inito Gallin and fumbled the ball.

And with nine seconds left, Howie

Heit kicked a, 25-yard ﬁeld goal, _

which later proved to be the win-
ning margin.

“Accepting the punt was a mis-
take on their part,” Hart said.
“We had to kick the ball any-
way.

“All during the game they

(West Virgina) were running '

around like crazy. They were in

confusion,” Hart said. “And they .

fscoorsns,

made some mistakes that hurt
them.”
Although the fumble and en-

suing field goal may have been '

the turning point in the game,
Hart feels that a fouth down
pass to Mickey Rosborough in the
fourth quarter was the critical
play of the game. It led to the
Panthers second touchdown.

“Although our options were
running better today than they
have all year, I ﬁgured we had
to throw the ball,’’ Hart said.
Rosborough caught James’ pass
on the ﬁve-yard line before go-
ing out of bounds. In two plays,
tailback Joe Jones scored.

Fullback Mike Raklewicz, voted
the outstanding player of the
game by the local newspapermen,
doubled his rushing yardage for
the season. He gained 97 yards
net.

Handelman’s
Record Helps
Harriers Win

Sparked by Frank Hande]man’s
record breaking time, the cross-
country team defeated Gannon
College Saturday, 15-40. Handel-
man’s time of 22:50 over the four-
and-one-half mile course broke
the course record by seconds
which was set by Tim Burnes of

- Panthers Finish-Off Mountaineers, 17-14?

VOTED THE most valuable player of the game, fullback Mike Raide-
wicz rushed for 97 yards. Four times he gained 12 yards or more.-

His running opened up the West Virginia defense for quarterback -

Ed James’ passes.

DAVE SHIIVIPENO" steals the ban -from Ohio play-
er, as Al Traunsteiner looks on. This was a. fre-

By MIKE\BROURMAN .

Maybe it’s the ballpark. The Pirates were terrors on
offense all year at Forbes Field, but no more so than the
soccer team was Saturday. Dormant in the last two games,
the offense returned with a vengence, as the booters stopped pre-
viously unbeaten Ohio University, 5-1.

The booters were in command from the start. With less than
seven minutes gone in the ﬁrst quarter, halfback Al Traunsteiner-
dribbled through the Ohio defense, and beat the goalie from close
range to start the scoring parade.

Fifteen minutes later, trailer Pete Snyder converted the rebound
of a shot by Bob Racunas, and the booters led 2-0. This was all the
scoring in the ﬁrst half due mainly to Ohio goalie Bill Harkins who
made some ﬁne saves. » '

Meanwhile, goalie Len Harman was having a relatively easy time
of it, thanks to both the pressure of the offense, and the improved
play of the defense. Fullbacks Art Richardson, Jim Snyder, and Joe
Kruth turned away the few offensive thrusts Ohio could muster, so
Harman was called upon for only one save in the ﬁrst half. _

The advent of the second half found the booter offense once
more in high gear. After-eight minutes, right wing Racunas tallied

Students and Clergy Discuss
 State of Religion on Campus

(Continued from Page 1)
live in the time of the death of
God. God is totally absent; the
sacred has been lost. Students are
looking for away to ﬁnd mean-
ing in a Godless world, and this
is probabl.y why my course in
existentialism is so crowded.” He
stated, “Yes, the campus is God-
less—we no longer have a God
to structure our lives.”

However, Dr. Rubenstein noted
that this could only be a stage
in the timetable of our lives, and‘
that later, when students are
ready to have I a family, they
might feel the need to again asso-
ciate with a religion.

When the topic was left open
for discussion, Dr. Gerjuoy ques-
tioned, Dr. Rubenstein’s last com-._
ment by saying, “I did not give
my children any religious educa-
tion, and they don't seem the

Pitt Students
To Protest
VietnamWar

Students for Peace (SFP) in
conjunction with the Pittsburgh
Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, is organizing a rally to
protest U.S. involvement in Viet-
nam when Vice-president Hubert
H. Humphrey speaks at the Penn
Theater tomorrow at 7 p.m. Bill
Weber, president of SFP, has an-

- nounced that transportation will

be provided on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-
served basis from the SU Desk at
6:30 p.m.

Weber noted that men should
Wear jackets and women should
be attired in skirts or dresses.
Humphrey will be in town on be-
half of Milton Shapp, Democratic
candidate for governor.

Besides this demonstration and
a petition published in the Pitt
News, SFP "has established a
Speaker’s Bureau, directed by
Alex Frank, a member of the
William Pitt Debate Union, which
will be on call to hold discus-
sions for any interested organi-
zations.

worse for it. In fact, they seem‘

ed happy that they could sleep
late on Sunday, while other chil-

dren had to get up early.”

When discussing the meaning
of religion, Rev. Biegertl mention-
ed, “My position allows me to be
active in civil rights and other so-
cial problems.” Mamdani prompt-
ly remarked, “One does not have
to have religion to be committed
to a cause.”

Several parents questioned Mam-
dani and the most signiﬁcant was
the last one. A lady in the back
of the ballroom asked, “Do you
believe you have a soul and do

you believe in the hereafter?”

“Good, Lord no!” replied Mam-

dani.

WASH "N 'WEAR CLOTHES.

  

 

  

NEED DRY CLEANING CARE.

The more washing, the

less wearing you can expect
from your Wash ’n Wear
clothes. Fabrics lose

their body, seams pucker,
lapels wrinkle, trouser
creases disappear. When
you have them drycleaned
you'll like the smooth

feel of the fabric, the

way suits—all of your
clothes—look, the way

they keep their press.

To have all your

Wash ’n Wear clothes
looking their best, let
CRANDALL give them
professional drycleaning care.
