Internet petition:

Censure Clinton

Erin Lindeman
Senlor Staff Writer

A Pitt student delivered a paper copy of the world’s largest elec-

, tronic petition, urging the censure of President Clinton, to the office

of Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa, on Thursday afternoon.

The petition, Censure and Move On, was collected on the
Internet and is part of a nonpartisan nationwide campaign,
Move()n.org, to tell Congress that it must immediately censure
President Clinton and move on to pressing issues facing the coun-
try.

The petition served two purposes, according to its district con-
gressional contact, Lea Griggs.

Griggs is a Pitt student and currently works in the University’s
Human Resources Department. She will graduate in April.

“It brought awareness to Congress and also showed that the
Internet is a valuable tool to get voices together and make an
impact,” she said

Griggs was supposed to deliver the petition, which had more
than 285,000 signatures, directly to Coyne, but he was unavailable,
and she delivered the petition to Barbara Cain, his chief assistant.

Pitt student has role in
NBC’s ”|'emptations”

Dan Sauder
’Senlor Staff Wrlter

Pittsburgh was the scene for the filming of NBC’s
miniseries about the soul group the Temptations in
September, and "many Pitt students were involved in the
production -as extras or bit players.

,But one Pitt. student, senior Johnnie Brown, has
approximately a l0~minuterole in the movie, appearing

as Damon. Harris, the_ Temptation who replaced original

group member Eddie Kendricks in 197 3.

Brown’s character debuts iﬁttonightls 9 p.m. conclu-
sion of the two-part movie. The first installment aired
last night. ‘ A .

Other Pitt students served as extras in the movie,
earning approximately $100 for a day’s worth of work.

Traveling to the film set was not that difficult for
many of the-students because portions of the movie were
filmed in Oakland. In fact, one of the buildings across
from the Chevron Science Center was used. Other loca-
tions included Heinz Hall in downtown Pittsburgh, and

locations in Friendship and Squirrel Hill.

The movie was directed by Allan Arkush, who won
an Emmy Award for his work on Fox’s “Ally McBeal.’’
According to Brown, Arkush was a very serious direc-
tor. '

“Filming was straight‘ serious,” said Brown. “Every

Julie Evans stood at the podium
outside the William Pitt Union on
Friday night and asked those in her
audience who have never been
affected by sexual violence, direct-
ly or indirectly, to raisetheir hands.

She told "the listeners to ‘ look
around: There was a long silence as
heads turned and eyes peered
through the crowd to see if one
hand was raised among the hun-
dreds of people.

The cold -air forced some hands
in pockets, but not one hand was in
the air.

Evans, an education specialist
for the Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape, spoke to hundreds of people
at the William Pitt Union on Friday
night to kick off the Take Back the
Night rally and march.

“We are here tonight to try to
claim and reclaim forever that ‘no’

The hard statistics of rape and
sexual abuse sometimes cause peo-
ple to think too broadly about the
subject, she said.

Alison Novicki, a Pitt alumna,
said she is a victim of rape. She
wore ‘a T-shirt saying that rape is
not a women’s issue; rather, it is a
social issue. The back of the T—shirt
said, “I survived. I march for those
who have not.”

Novicki returned to Pitt on
Friday night to march in. Take Back

/-the Night. She said just because she

is not a student anymore does not
mean she can ignore the issue.

“This march is about awareness.
It’s not to care, it’s not to annoy, it’s
not to bash men, it’s about support-
ing each other,” said Novicki.

The 2,965 reported rapes in
Pennsylvania in 1996 equates to
eight rapes per day, according to

THE. Prrr NEWS 3

New newspaper, runbyPittsburgh’s

homeless, aims to raise awareness

and pay for its staff's necessities.

Joseph K. Gordon
For The Pitt News

Vincent Hall says he is a.home-
less person looking forward to an
opportunity to participate in a ven-
dor program that he hopes will
enable him to earn money and
improve his current situation.

The opportunity is a new news-
paper called StreetVoice, which is
written and published by homeless
people and is making its debut
today. Homeless people will sell the
newspaper as an alternative to pan-
handling and are allowed to keep 60
cents of the $1 cover price.

“StreetVoice was born out the
commitment of formerly homeless
men and women, social-services
providers and community volun-
teers who wanted to create a grass-
roots vehicle which would enter-
tain, promote social responsibility,
and illuminate the issues of home-
lessness,” said Sharon Thorp, direc-
tor of social services at the Wood
Street Commons housing develop-
ment.

The newspaper addresses the
need of homeless men, women and
children to express, in their own
words, their feelings and opinions
about the experiences of poverty
and homeless life in Pittsburgh.

“StreetVoice translates the expe-
rience of homelessness into person-

al terms for the education of the
public,” Thorp said. '

Jesse J ackson’s bright smile will
light up the cover of the inaugural
edition. There are ads inside for
Levi’s jeans and Doc Martens boots
that will help finance the paper.

» Articles-have headlines such as

“P.A. on ten bucks a day,” and there
are short stories and poetry written
by homeless people.

Anybody who considers himself
homeless is qualified to be a Street
Voice vendor. To obtain a vendor’s
license, the homeless person must
be approved by the newspaper.

The street—newspaper movement
has had success in many other
cities. Cleveland, San Francisco,
Boston, Seattle, Toronto, Chicago,

New paper written by
homeless makes debut

New York and London have suc-
cessfully launched street—vendor
programs.

Thorp said that StreetWise, a.

street newspaper in Chicago, has
made $93 million in the past five
years. Of that total, she said, street
vendors earned approximately $69
million.

“While StreetVoice may not
duplicate the success of StreetWise,
we expect to match Seattle, a city
whose demographics are compara-
ble to Pittsburgh,” Thorp said.

She said Seattle’s Real Change
made $312,000 last year. The news-
paper’s street vendors earned
$234,000. Much of that money was
used to pay for basic necessities
such as food, clothingand shelter.

Street newspapers can also serve
as an incentive for homeless people
to find alternatives to begging.

“Our purpose is to spread
awareness of poverty and homeless
issues to the community and to act
as a transition from panhandling to
employment,” said Brian
Mendelssohn, the editor of Street
Voice. .

Many cities with street newspa-
pers have experienced a decrease in

panhandling activities, according to »

Thorp. The objective of StreetV0ice
is to have panhandlers disappear
from Downtown. -
“When given a choice, the pub-
lic invariably opts to purchase a
street newspaper. Panhandlers soon
get the message and move on,”
Thorp said. “Crimes in many down-
town areas have decreased. I think
this suggests that the high visibility
of the vendors deters crime. The
street vendors have an investment to
protect themselves. After all, street
crime drives away customers.”
“StreetVoice will only ﬂourish
as it becomes a vital part of the
Pittsburgh community,” Thorp said.
“The newspaper organization is
itself a consortium of  homeless
and formerly homeless individual
and community volunteers who
have resolved to keep the interest of
homeless people paramount in the
minds of Pittsburgh [residents].”

MARCH

Evans.

“These women are us. We are
not isolated from the statistics,”
said Evans.

Aggie Hanczewski and Meghan
Gates, managers of the rally and
march, recognized a need for rais-
ing awareness for sexual abuse
when they first attended the march
last year.

Take Back the Night originated
in Britain, where women wanted to
take back the night from criminals
and rapists. They wanted to be able
to walk down the street with confi-
dence, no matter their gender. The
first march took place in 1977 in

London. In 1978, San Francisco was
the site of the first American march.

“This is a serious issue and an
empowering experience,” said
Hanczewski.

After Evans’ speech, Nicole
Showalter, president of the Campus
Women’s Organization, told the
crowd where to march. As one stu-
dent held a bullhorn and started
chants, a member of the campus
police told Showalter that the police
escort was ready and waiting.

As students started around the
corner of Bvigelow Boulevard and
down to the Forbes Avenue inter-
section, people waved signs and
chanted, “Whatever we wear, wher-

ever we go, ‘yes’ means ‘yes’ and‘

7'99

‘-no’ means ‘no

The light turned green for traf-
fic on Forbes, but the marchers did
not break stride. With the police
escort, they marched across the
street and down Forbes, spilling off
the sidewalk onto the far lane of the
street.

Students, teachers, parents and
citizens joined in the march that
went from the William Pitt Union,
down Forbes Avenue to Carnegie
Mellon University, past the Pitt fra-
ternity houses and the lower cam-
pus, and then back to the porch of
the WPU for the candlelight vigil
and open mike ceremony.

This is one of two marches held
each year to end sexual violence.

The next march will be in the,

spring.

CLINTON

Griggs delivered the District 14 petition
at noon. At the same time, constituents from
226 districts and 44 states delivered peti-
tions to their representatives from Congress.

Griggs said Coyne called her Friday
morning and apologized for not being in the
oﬂice to receive the petition in person.

A spokesperson at MoveOn.org’s head-
quarters in San Francisco said that the peti-
tion was a broad effort to mobilize con-
stituents to meet directly with members of
Congress about the scandals in Washington.

By using e-mail and the World VVide
Web, MoveOn.org spreads its belief that it is
time for Congress to censure the president
and move on with the business of the coun-

. ‘Griggs said’ press reports and the more

gressional districts. This permitted
MoveOn.org to apprise representatives of
the number of signatures and comments
from their speciﬁc constituents.

“[Co-founders] Wes Boyd and Joan
Blade have provided a of majority
Americans with this Internet forum to not
only petition our congressional representa-
tives with ease, but also have provided alot
of support in areas of strengthening our col-
lective voice with unparalleled support,”
said Steve Martin, a MoveOn.org volunteer
in Monroeville.

According to an event summary sent
out by Boyd, the organization has already
heard from congressional staff members
who were impressed by the demeanor and
presentation of the people submitting the

FROM PAGE 1

petitions, who showed diversity, strength,
seriousness, and commitment.

“That was exactly our objective,” Boyd
said.

Matt Mutchler is one of the 784 con-
stituents who responded from the 14th
District, which includes Pittsburgh.

7 “The country is trillions of dollars in
debt, but [the government] will spend $50
million investigating the president’s private
life? Bad idea,” Mutchler wrote on the
online petition. —

Another constituent, Michael
Rectenwald, also commented online.

“The MAJORITY wants Congress to
LEAVE CLINTON in office, quit the pruri-
ent, voyeuristic, school—boy pomogiaphy,
and move on,” Rectenwald said

than a quarter million collected signatures
indicate that MoveOn.org’s eiforts reﬂect
the majority opinion of the people and
should help to sway Congress against
impeachment proceedings.

TEMPTATIONS

scene was shot between 10 and 12
times.”

Brown also said that the behind-
the—scenes practical jokes that are
usually carried out on movie sets
did not take place.

“None of this ever went on, not
once,” said Brown. H o w e v e r ,
Brown was very pleased that Arkush
allowed him to do a great deal of
improvisation with his character.

“[The character] is totally arro-
gant and ﬂamboyant and ostenta-
tious,” said Brown.

Brown plays Harris when he was
first introduced to the group. The
Temptations had already come
together and had been signed to a
contract by legendary Motown cre-
ator Berry Gordy. Both Kendricks
and fellow original member David
Ruffin left the group to start solo
careers.

The movie’s executive producer,
Suzanne de Passe, was also the pro-
ducer of “The Jacksons: An

American Dream,” a movie that
aired on ABC and is repeated on

 

VH1. ,

According to Brown, Detroit
was “extremely furious” that the
Temptations film was shot ‘in
Pittsburgh because Motown was
based in Detroit. ‘

Pittsburgh iMayor Tom Murphy
is partially credited for bringing in
major Hollywood films, such as
Inspector Gadget and Dogma,
which Brown also had a minor part
in.

The city’s policy, which Murphy
has endorsed, of not taxing the
industry for filming here lures film-
makers away from other cities.
Murphy and other members of City
Council believe that there is no need
to charge an amusement tax because
movies bring in hundreds» of people
on the film crew who spend hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars sup-
porting local businesses.

As far as Brown’s acting career
goes, he has an audition this month
for the Michael Jordan biography,
which is expected to film in
Pittsburgh.

NBA lockout has gone on
four months too long

The NBA lockout has just
entered its fourth month. A day
before the regular season was
scheduled to start, nothing has
been resolved. It looks probable
that the regular season will start
in December, but team owners

and. NBA officials fear that it‘

may well be into the new year
before play begins.

The lockout has gone on for
three months too long. It’s
about time the players rescind
their original demands, stop
being greedy and get back to
playing basketball.

Team owners want to insert

"a clause in players’ contracts

that will allow the NBA to con-
duct drug tests on players. The
players’ union strongly objects
to these tests, currently used in
other professional sports (used
with Puritanical zeal at the
Olympic Games).

Why should players object '

to such a clause? Why should
they be angered that team own-
ers want to keep their ludicrous-
ly expensive players drug-free?
If their players are caught with
possession of narcotics (or deal-
ing narcotics, as some players
are wont to do), why should

team owners bear the brunt of

their absence when they miss

games while stuck in jail?

With a current wage ceiling
and wage ﬂoor of $9.3 million
and $275,000 per annum
respectively, a drug clause
should not be much of an irrita-
tion. If janitorial staff at certain
corporations have to take drug
tests and cope with $5.15 an
hour, surely the higher—paid
celebrities can cope, too.

The major issue the owners
and players are fighting about is
money (what else in these times
of greed?). Players want the
wage‘ cap removed and want
teams to give 60 percent of their
revenue to pay players’ salaries
(the team owners want to pay
only 50 percent, and players’
agents refuse the middle ground
of 55 percenttbecause players

team’s revenue last season).

It’s time for this farce to
end. It’s also time for fans to
seek suitable alternatives if
their “role models” act greedy;
the NCAA basketball season
will not be plagued with such
issues, nor do college teams
charge an arm and a leg for a
ticket.

NBA players should put

We hold these truths to be self-eviclent

On Forbes Avenue the other day, I took
notice of three young African-Americanboys
playing on the sidewalk. As one of them lay ﬂat
on his stomach, the other two held him down and
applied imitation handcuffs to his wrists. Excuse
me, but shouldn’t I ﬁnd this disturbing?

Boys will be boys, it is true, and boys’
games have always mimicked adult violence,
but in this case, the realism of the children’s por-
trayal betrayed what I took to be ﬁrsthand expe-
rience with the type of event being portrayed I
do not think this was an unreasonable assump-
tion on my part, either, because these youngsters
were also unwittingly recreating the statistical
reality in America today: Current estimates place
up to one-third of young African—American men
under the jurisdiction of the criminal “justice”
system (in prison, on probation or on parole).

This little incident caused me to reﬂect on
Amnesty Interrrational’s recent release of the
report “United States of America: Rights for
All.” For years, Amnesty International has
meticulously documented the misdeeds of both
governments and opposition groups
throughout the world From political
"prisoners in Cuba to army atrocities
in Guatemala and El Salvador,
Amnesty International has exposed
the ugly truth regardless of political
ideology. Now, for the ﬁrst time ever, the organi-
zation has focused in a systematic way on
human rights violations in the United States.
Here are the gruesome highlights of the report:

1. Amnesty International ﬁnds “a wide-
spread and persistent problem of police brutality
across the USA.”_ There are numerous com-
plaints of beatings, shootings, dangerous
restraint holds, and other cases of excessive
force, the majority of them involving members
of ethnic minorities. Amnesty International also
questions the use of so—called “non-lethal”
weapons such as tasers and OC (pepper) spray.

I 2. There is “a pattem of needless and oﬂi—
cially sanctioned brutality” in prisons and jails in
the United States, where there are now some 1.7
million people incarcerated.

3. Asylurn-seekers ﬂeeing persecution in
other countries are often detained indeﬁnitely
upon arrival in the United States and “are held in
conditions that are sometimes inhuman and

degrading.”

4. Despite international standards that seek’

to limit -the use of the deaﬂr penalty, the United
States has accelerated its use of the barbarous
practice. Most heinously, the United States joins
Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen
as one of six countries that execute juvenile
oﬁenders.

5. The United States hypocritically trumpets
its support for human rights and criticizes the
hurnan-rig_hts records of governments it opposes
whﬂe blithely ignoring international standards as
it sees ﬁt. For example, the ‘United States joins
Somalia —— a state that has collapsed and now
has no recognized government — as one of only
two countries that have not ratiﬁed the
Convention on the Rights of the Child.

6._Through covert operations," the notorious

_ U.S. Army School of the Americas, and other

means, the United States supplies “arms, securi-
ty equipment and training to governments and
armed groups that have cornrrritted torture, polit-
ical killings and other hurnan—rights abuses in
countries around the world” ‘

I ~ The report also locates the origin of U.S.
hurnan—rights abuses in the gross
social inequalities that beset U.S.
society as a whole: epidemic racism
and poverty.

Since Amnesty International
announced that it would be initiating
a year—long campaign against human rights
abuses in the United States, the group has come
under ﬁre from the usual suspects. Indignant
U.S. politicians, oﬂicials and media ﬁgures have
responded with the same kind of apologetics,
denials and angry bluster that Amnesty members
have come to expect from the contemptible
operatives of banana republics. It must be frus-
trating to have to make apologies for the country
that irnprisons a higher percentage of its citizens
than any other country on earth. I, for one, have
never been prouder to be a member of Amnesty
International. /.

- Do you know what? This
Congress sucks

Michael Berquist
Columnlst

So another year is almost‘ done and
Election Day has come upon us once again.
Republican senators and congressmen
have gone home and are facing the music

 
 
  

   

promised to work on meaningful cam-
paign—ﬁnance reform but instead cynically
squashed any attempts to limit the amount
of money their donors can give to their
campaign funds.

The Republicans mysteriously aban-
doned needed reforms of Social Security
and Medicare, which Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich once insisted were “moral
imperatives.” Under pressure from the
tobacco lobby, the Republicans killed the
tobacco bill in exchange for money for their

, campaign coﬂ’ers for this fall. Evidently, the

Republican moral imperative deserts them
as soon as they see a dollar sign.

' So what were the major accomplish-
ments of the 105th Congress? Well, it did
pass bills naming National Airport after
Ronald Reagan and CIA headquarters after
George Bush. It also passed a new
Highway Spending Bill loaded with good-
ies for members to hand out to their con-
stituents while they rail against the taxes
that provided them. The Republican failure
to cut taxes or amend the tax code prompt-
ed George Will to complain, “How will
Republicans run [in 1998], having pro-
duced 824 reasons to disbelieve them?”
How indeed?

In other words, this Congress hasn’t
done much at all, other than contradict itself
again and again. In fact, the 105tl1 Congress
has been such a dismal disaster that many
are comparing it to -the infamous “Do
Nothing” Congress from 50 years ago that
was such a public embarrassment In 1948,
the American public realized how badly the
Republicans had bungled their chance to

‘ get something done and kicked them out

the door. It’s about time for history to repeat
itself. -

Finally, we come to the architect of this
pitiﬁrl atfair". Newt Gingrich. For the last

four years, Gingrich has disastrouslye

reigned over the House of Representatives
as speaker of the house. His tenure has
shown that he is a zealot suffering ﬁom
arrested development who saw nothing

wrong in 1994 with using the tragic death
of two young children to further his own
agenda. Gingrich’s antics as speaker have
been so embarrassing to the country that
one Republican congressman labeled him
“roadkill” and Sen. Bob Dole spoke of the
need for “adult leadership” in the House.

Gingrich’s erratic, off—the-cuff remarks are‘

unbeﬁtting of the statesman role that the
speakership requires of the man who occu-
' s the c E '

   

conservatives who rail against  
government spending while they 
whirlwind of upper—income tax cu s,
defense contracts and military bases steered
toward their districts.

Even worse is the fetid stench of -cor-
ruption that hangs in the air over" Congress.
The self-righteous Gingrich has shown that
he is an astonishingly crooked double-deal-
er who was ﬁned $300,000 by the House
Ethics Committee. Worse still, Gingrich

Vole Republican on Nov. 3

Carrie Hager

  
 
    
 

columnist

With the 105th Republican—dominated
Congress doing a great job, please make the
wise choice and vote Republican on Nov. 3.
It is important for the sake of our country that
the 106th Congress remain Republican, not
only because it will continue to draft legisla-

tion that beneﬁts all Americans, but also

because it will keep President Clinton in line
and make sure he is held accountable for his
actions.

 
    

tio  the Iraq e
 orce lnvestrnent Act, the Ornmbus
ropriations, the Digital Millennium
yright Act, the Identify Theft and

"Assumption Deterrence Act and the

International Religious Freedom Act
Congress has done well in cutting back
welfare and getting people back to work. It
sees the importance of making people
become productive, contributing members
to society. It seesthatitis notrightforpeo-
ple to get something for nothing, living olf
the taxpayers’ dollars. People on welfare

halls of Congress. sets up job train-

Their actions
are morally repugnant. How can Gingrich
and his cohorts talk about ethics when they
allow lobbyists to rewrite clean—water laws

to allow corporations to endanger the pub-

lic health? Gingrich and his minions are so
out of step with middle—class Americans
that he recently boasted of his efforts to cut
millions of dollars devoted to renovating
public schools out of the budget. Somehow,
I don’t think those children suffering in
crumbling inner-city schools will thank
him for his eﬁorts.

If you want to preserve the status quo
and elect hypocrites who do nothing but
name buildings, then I fully exhort you to
vote Republican this fall. You will get what
you deserve. '

On the other hand, if you want change
and progress, I encourage you to Vote for
the Democratic Party on Nov. 3.

Michael Berquist wants to encourage
everyone to vote Democratic. The country
you save will be your own.

These will help people get the training they
need to go out and get jobs. '

The Drug—Free Communities Act of
1997 will help communities develop and
implement long-terrn programs to prevent
and treat substance abuse among youth.
Drug abuse is a serious problem that can
atfect all aspects of a person’s life, and peo-
ple who use drugs need help. Our generation
and the country’s future depends on it.

The Protection of Children From
Predators Act is one of the most meaningful
bills passed by this Congress. It passed in
both the House and the Senate and is await-
ing ﬁnal approval ﬁom the president. Any
legislation passed to help protect children is
crucial for our country.

Children’s safety is of much concern to
our country’s future because kids can’t pro-
tect themselves. College students might be
wondering why a law such as this one is
valuable to them since most college students
don’t have children. It is very important

because even if you aren’t a parent, you
probably have a niece or a nephew or some
child you care about and want to remain
safe. This law will protect children not only
from predators and pedophiles, but also from

child pornography and domestic sexual .

abuse. It will also increase penalties for
offenses against children and for repeat
offenders. Murder and kidnapping investiga-
tions will also be increased More laws such
as this one will be passed if the Republicans
are re—elected.

importance of a strong military, and this is
one of the reasons concerned Americans
don’t want them to take ﬂre House.

Ifthe Democrats are elected, I’m afraid
of.what they, along with Clinton, might be
capable of.

One thing for sure is that they would
keep raising the minimum wage, which dri-
vesprices up and hurts consumers. It will
also hurt skilled laborers who earn above the
minimum wage, since most employers
won’t compensate those who are already
maldng more than  wage.

Continuing to raise minimum wage is
the least of what will happen if the
Democrats are elected There would be
nothing to stop Clinton from passing what-
ever liberal agenda he has been dying to get
though but can’t because of the Republicans.

Clinton has been wanting a sort of glob-
al government of which he would be presi-

' dent. This would cause the United States to

lose a lot of world power, therefore endan-
gering all of its  The country will go
farther and farther downhill if Clinton is free
to do what he wants, which he will be able
to do if there is a Democratic majority in
Congress. .

C The Democrats also wouldn’t hold
Clinton accountable for his actions as the
Republicans do. Just because someone is
president doesn’t mean he is above the law.
After all, perjury is illegal —— at least it was
last time I checked —— and he must be
removed from office.

It is vital for the sake of our country that I

Can you spare some sense?

Tony Oliva
Columnlst

I was walking down Forbes
Avenue the other day when I was over-
whelmed by the infestation of burns.
Yes, I said it, burns. I refuse to use
such politically correct euphernisms as
“transient workers” or “the financially
challenged.” For once, someone is
going to tell it how it is. I guess today
that’s me. .

In describing those panhandlers
who litter the streets of Oakland, I find
myself using the word “bum.” Many of
you might not like that, but I don’t
care. As I stated, they are not “transient
workers.” If they were recently unem-
ployed, what are they doing wasting
the day away asking for handouts
when they should be out looking for
jobs? Maybe they are just waiting for
the first of the month so they can pick
up their welfare checks that every
other hard-working taxpayer and I pro-
vide (but this is a column all by itself).
Don’t let them fool you by telling you
there are no jobs available. I bet
McDonald’s is hiring.

Unfortunately, these people are out
there because of the bleeding hearts
who are suckered into their ploy and
actually give them money. I ask those

of you who do this, Do you think you
are helping these people? If you
answer yes, I have a news ﬂash for
you: You’re not. It is you people who
make it so they don’t have to get jobs.
All they have to do is rely on your pity.
I call it what it is — pity.

Some may call it compassion, but
that’s a bunch of bull. Compassion is
going to some-
where like the
Hill District,
finding a sin-
gle mom who
works 60 hours
a week to feed
her three chil-
dren, and giv-
ing her a bag I
or two of gro—' *
ceries — not as
a handout but
because she
deserves it.
She-has pride and dignity in that she
refuses to beg because she wants her
children to do better than what she did.
Don’t believe what liberals and
Hollywood keep shoving down our
mouths about how the inner cities are
full of welfare moms with a hundred
kids. Most of the women in the inner
cities are strong, spirited women who

Many of you reading this might

deserve my hard—eamed money. I have,
on numerous occasions, given money
to a guy playing guitar, harmonica,
trumpet or ﬂute. I’ve also spared some
change to the blind guy who sings
along with his boom box. These are the
people who are trying to do better, who
refuse to only take, but give a little
back. I have no problem giving them a
little cash for services rendered. It’s
easy to give up your pride and dignity
and become a bum. If you want to
show compassion, force them to
become something better.

There’s an old adage I’ve always
liked: Give a man a fish, and you feed
him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and
you feed him for a lifetime.

I think it’s time we stop just giving
the fish away. The next time you walk
down Forbes Avenue and someone

asks for some spare change, tell him or '

Pitt of being a
good team  yet

SYRACUSE, N .Y. — It was loud.
Really loud.

It was orange. Really orange.

It was ugly —— well, at least pretty
ugly for the Panthers.

Pitt left Syracuse with a close loss,
but that is useless at this point. It was
great to see the Panthers hang tough
against the Orangemen, but that does
not get recruits, and it does not bring in

3 fans.

Pitt had a lot of problems, and those
problems need to be ﬁxed. The Panthers
got a safety on the Orangemen’s ﬁrst
drive. They put up 28 points with an
offense that had not been hitting on any
cylinders, let alone all of them.

Pitt’s defense did not play up to par,
and Syracuse rattled off 45 points. After
spending the afternoon on the sideline, I
realized there are some things that need
to be said.

First of all, I am the first to admit
that I waswrong last week. I called for
Matt Lytle to be benched, but Lytle
proved me and many others wrong. He
completed 18 of 28 passes for 221 yards
and two touchdowns.

Lytle proved that he is the man this
year and that he can lead this team. He
took his benching in stride and came
back with a newfound conviction. Lytle
played very well, much better than I
expected him to play this weekend in
the intimidating Carrier Dome.

Lytle was able to handle the pres-
sure and the noise of the big game and
big dome fairly well. He led the
Panthers cahnly and kept them collected
throughout much of the game. He only
took one sack .and was very composed
in the pocket, unlike previous games.
He looked as if he had grown and
learned from his quarter on the bench,

It was amazing how Lytle could call
the signals amidst all the cheering,
hoopla and music. Each third down for
the Panthers brought a sea of orange to

its feet to scream at the Pitt offense, '

accompanied by music that blared from
every crack and crevice of the giant
bubble. I could not talk to the photogra-
pher standing next to me, thanks to the
noise of the 49,000 plus in attendance.
Matt O’Connor, the starter for the
day, had happy feet in the pocket ——- feet
that would earn him a spot on the bench.
He was not able to stay still or get any-
thing done when Syracuse was able to

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — VV1th just under 10
minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Pitt
Panthers had a chance.

‘ Down 38-28 and due to receive a kick-
olf, the Panthers had scored on their last two
possessions and lurked just 10 points behind
the Syracuse Orangemen, a consensus top-
20 program entering Saturday’s contest.

Then Syracuse’s Peter Ferris launched a
high kick in the direction of Panther fresh-
man Kenny Harris, who stumbled backward
to ﬁeld the ball. While he stumbled, Pitt
retum—man Hank Poteat closed in. The two
collided, and the ball skipped away.
Syracuse scored a touchdown one play later.

Pitt no longer had a chance. The
Orangemen took the contest, 48-25, and
with only four games to play, the Panthers
(2-5, 0-3 Big East) must go undefeated to
have any chance at a bowl game.

“We made too many turnover rr1is-
takes,” Pitt coach Walt Harris said “You
can’t do that against a top-ranked team.”

quarter; before that, everyone in the Canier

A Syracuse tailback. Before

Senior Football Writer

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — When a
week’s worth of quarterback controversy
ﬁnally ended at the ‘Carrier ‘Dome on
Saturday, one clearwinner emerged:

Donovan McNabb. I

The Syracuse signal-caller led all
rushers in his team’s 45-28 victory over
the Panthers, racking up’ 98 yards on the.
ground and scoring a touchdown.

He led all passers with 228 yards in
the air. He threw two touchdown passes,
"including a 54-yard}; scoring strike‘ to
Maurice Johnson. When Pitt coach Walt
Harris was asked about his defense’s play
iI'l_..S_atur‘day-’s loss, h,_e___complimen_ted the
 defense, then added, “Yeah, it’s, just
 well, McNabb.”  ' ’ ‘

The senior’s 98_ yards equaled his
combined rushing yardage from his last
four contests. Most of those yards came
off the option, where
McNabb would fake a
pitch to Kyle McIntosh or 
Dee Brown and ﬂy into the
Panther secondary.

His rushing touch-
down came off that play at
the expense of Pitt comer-
back Hank Poteat. On first-
and-goal from the Pitt 6,
McNabb took the snap and
jogged to his left, waiting 
for Panther defenders to try 
to stop him from reaching
the end zone. ,

his teammates were either

pitch to McNabb’s right. ~

The Pitt Panther men’s soccer team
fought hard but couldn’t capitalize on many

_ scoring chances yesterday, losing to the

Syracuse Orangemen, 1-0, at Pitt Stadium.

“We didn’t get the job done today,”
coach Joe Luxbacher said. “It has been very
frustrating.”

In the opening minutes of the game, Pitt
came out strong with offensive pressure. The
organized passing in the box set up two
quick shots for the Panthers, but the team
failed to capitalize.

Just minutes later, Syracuse charged
back down the ﬁeld on one of its ﬁrst rushes
of the afternoon. Knittel broke into the box,
splitting the Panther defense and scoring
unassisted from 10 yards out in the fourth
minute of the ﬁrst half. The breakaway goal
would be the only score Syracuse needed

Though Pitt failed to score, it had many
scoring chances. In the ﬁrst half, senior for-
ward Drew Kopp nearly scored on Syracuse
goalkeeper Kevin Bacher after a great cross-
ﬁeld feed from freshman Jason Thackery.

Later, Kopp again almost lit up the
scoreboard for the Panthers when his header
ﬁom a Phil Matilla throw—in sailed over the
crossbar and out of bounds. Kopp ﬁnished

This made Trout’s

total number of ﬁeld goals scored the '

ﬁfth-highest in Syracuse history.

the afternoon leading the team with four
shots. , . -

“We’re in position to get the job done
but we don’t,” Luxbacher said.

Syracuse charged downﬁeld at the end
of the ﬁrst half only to be stopped up the
middle on an excellent save by Panther goal-
keeper Chris Hanlon, who came out of the

goal crease to challenge the shot up the rr1id- '

dle.

Hanlon was not as busy during the sec- l

ondhalfashe was inthe ﬁrst because his
offense spent a lot of time in the Syracuse
zone. —

Midﬁelder Thackery had a busy second
half. He had a breakaway downﬁeld in the
early minutes, but his centering attempt deep
in the Syracuse zone was broken up by the
tough Orange defense. Thackery also nearly
scored on a rebound from Syracuse goal-
keeper Kevin Bacher. His shot sailed just
wide of an empty net.

“It is very disappointing when we can’t
get the last pass,” sophomore midﬁelder

Chad Porter said. “It has been the story of

our season.”

Yesterday’s loss drops Pitt’s record to 5-
9-3 overall, 1-8-2 in the Big East. The
Panthers conclude their season Tuesday
when 'they host California University of
Pennsylvania at Pitt Stadium.

Women's basketball drops exhibition game, 66-49

Brad Cuprik
staff Wrlter

So much for a warm welcome.

The Pitt women’s basketball
team opened its season with a 66-49
loss to the Ohio All-Stars Sunday at
Fitzgerald Field House, marking the
debut of head coach Traci‘ Waites.

The Panthers fell behind early,

1 and although they kept the game

close for the first 10 minutes, Ohio

Lady Panther point guard Monique To

got control of the game and the
scoreboard and never relinquished
the lead.

After a three-pointer by
Michelle Katkdwski pulled the
Panthers to within two at 19-17, the
All-Stars went on a 13-0 run. Pitt
was held without a point for six
minutes and was down 36-24 at
halftime.

At the beginning of the second
half, the Panthers were a’more
patient offensive
team, but they
fell behind by 19
. with 9:50 leftip
the game. ""'

Pitt then had
its only serious
ruh, led 7 by
a n o t h e r
Katkowski; ‘three
and senior

iKortniA Webb’s
' foul shooting.

Pitt had
closed the gap to
55-45, but that
was as close as
the Lady
Panthers would
get.
The Ohio All-

E WHITEMAN / PHOTO EDITOR Stars were able
ney looks to have

to take advan-
tage of erratic

Pitt shooting, and they converted
three uncontested layups to push
the lead to 20, their biggest of the
day.

Webb led the Panthers, register-
ing a double-double _with 16 points
and 10 rebounds, both team highs.
Katkowski was the only other
Panther in double figures in scor-
ing, finishing with 10 points. Senior
forward Alecia Balich added nine
points, five rebounds and three
assists. Junior center Nickeia
Morris played Well defensively,
recording 4 blocks in 17 minutes of
playing time.

As a team, Pitt shot poorly, hit-
ting on just 27.6 percent of its
shots, but that’s expected, accord-
ing to Waites.

“We’re not making excuses,”
she said. “We want to be here, try-
ing, every game. At some points in
the game, we reverted to old habits
because we didn’t know what to do,
and so we rushed our shots.”

Waites was impressed with the
team’s effort and said, “Until we
learn how to. play together and
we’re clicking on all. cylinders, this
can be expected. But these players
come to win. 3 -

“They want to win more than
me. Some of them have been here
for three and four years now and
have had to suffer through losing

P FROM PAGE 10

Backup Matt Lytle admitted that the
lead surprised him; the surprise didn’t last.

Syracuse came back with a ﬁeld goal,
and on Pitt’s ensuing possession, Duke
Pettijohn drilled O’Connor and forced a
fumble. Defensive lineman Rickie Sirnpkins
grabbed the loose ball and retumed it to the
Syracuse 1—yard line before being dropped
by Kevan Barlow.

It was the ﬁrst of two tumovers for the
junior. He gave way to Lytle on Pitt’s second
possession of the second period

“I was happy for him,” said Harris,
when asked about O’Connor’s performance,
“but his inexperience  Division-I football
caught up with him.”

' Lytle ‘entered the game in a 17-9 hole
after Dee Brown scored one of his two rush-
ing touchdowns for the Orange.

Lytle had been benched by Harris earli-
er in the week as a motivational tool.
Immediately, the quarterback set about prov-
ing that he’d been properly motivated

The senior drove Pitt 41 yards in eight

plays, resulting in a ﬁrst—and-goal at the
Syracuse 8-yard line. The next 8 yards came
on the strength of wideout Latef G1im’s rib
cage. Lyﬂe threw a fade pattern to the right
comer of the end zone, and Grim stretched
out his right hand to pull the pass to his chest
before it hit the Carrier Dome carpet.

He extended himself so much that he
couldn’t break his own fall, landing football-
ﬁrst with his ribs slamming into the turf and
the pigskin at the same time. Grim attributed

the catch to anything but chance.

“You just have to keep working hard,”
he said. “And it was good tosee the end
result of working hard in practice.”

The score made it 17-15 Syracuse, but
Pitt failed on the two-point conversion.

It would be the last chance that the
Panthers got to tie the contest. McNabb ﬁred
two long touchdown passes on his team’s
next two drives —— a short Chris Ferencik
ﬁeld goal between the tallies made the score
31-18 late in the third, and another chip shot,
this one from 20 yards out, made it 31-21 at
the start of the fourth period.

The teams traded touchdowns early in
the ﬁnal stanza, with Lytle hitting Grim for
the pair’s second score and McNabb speed-
ing by Poteat into the end zone for a 5-yard
Syracuse answer.

Then the special-tearns mishap, which
Poteat called a “miscommunication,” fol-
lowed, ending any Panther chances of win-
ning and sending the slowly stirring
Syracuse crowd into Pandemonium.

Brown, the SU nmning back, picked up
the post—co1]ision loose ball and attempted to
run it into the end zone for a Syracuse score.

But it’s illegal for the kicking team to
advance a mutfed kickoff, so the Orange
would wait a play. Kevin Johnson — a
Syracuse wideout who ﬁnished_the contest
with 77 yards receiving and a touchdown
catch —— scored untouched on a 19-yard
reverse play to put the game out of reach.

“We gave them the game,” Harris said

“They’re a good enough football team to‘

take it, too.
“I thought we had a chance.”

The rest of the half was marked by
four steals from defensive wizard

The second half started off slowly,
with no one scoring before Cosby’s

The teams traded transition bas-

three-pointer by Lockhart and a mon-

Panthers up by 20, burying any hope
the All-Stars had of winning.

The game ended on an uncontest-

Panthers a 97-74 victory.

The team hit an amazing 11 of 22

put pressure on him, which was almost
every play. O’Connor also had trouble
running simple plays in Pitt’s offense,
such as the option. '

The junior-college transfer ran right
into the teeth of the Orange defense a
few times and made poor pitches on
other occasions. All in all, his perfor-
mance was one to leave in Syracuse.-

The noise did not help O’Connor,
either. He was not able to get the calls to
his team, and this caused a great deal of
confusion.

With the aid of the two signal-
callers,_ the Panthers were able to go
punch-for-punch with the Orangemen.
Pitt delivered the early blows, going up
9-0 in the first quarter, but Syracuse was
able to come back and give the Panthers
a hard time, taking the lead 17-9 before
the end of the quarter.

FROM PAGE 10

But Pitt, behind the leadership of

Lytle, would not quit playing, and the
Panthers kept matching the Orangemen
every time they made a big play. When
the Orangemen threw a touchdown pass,
the Panthers bounced back with a big
play or drive of their own. _

Often, it involved Lytle making
some sort of amazing move to evade

- pressure and then completing a pass to a

receiver, who made an impossible catch.

“What we got from this team is
exactly what we expected,” Syracuse
head coach Paul Pasqualoni said.

The Orangemen knew the Panthers
would play tough, and they did, but Pitt
did not play tough enough to win.

So Syracuse got no surprises, but it
still dominated Pitt on the scoreboard in
the end.

Donovan McNabb is one of the best
quarterbacks — if not the best quarter-

back — in the country, and he is the
main reason the Orangemen were able
to overcome Pitt. He ripped the Pitt
defense to pieces, throwing for 228
yards and rushing for 98.

McNabb killed the Panthers with
big‘ plays and with his leadership and
intelligence on every down. Pitt could
not stop him. His experience helped
Syracuse to roll over the inexperienced
Panthers.

Although he had an outstanding
game, McNabb had no business being in

-the game with less than ﬁve minutes

remaining. He came onto the field for
the last drive and risked a great deal. He
could have easily been injured, or he
could have just done some more damage
to an already beaten Pitt defense.

McNabb had no business being in
the game when his team had a 17-point
lead. His coach, offensive coordinator
Kevin Rogers, didn’t seem to agree.

“He was just in there to win the
game. Maybe we could have gotten him
out of there a little earlier.”

Maybe? ‘

Most deﬁnitely.

All in all, the trip to Syracuse will
prove to be a learning experience for this
young Panther team. They played in a
loud and hostile environment. They saw
what a world-class quarterback can do.
And they know they can take another
team’s best hit and come back fighting
on the road. -

But this trip was far from a success.
The Panthers still have a long way to go,
and you shouldn’t expect them to get
there this season. They need to break
through and take first step soon, though.

Patrick Robertson is the sports editor of
The Pitt News and is now taking sug-
gestions for what he can do with his win-
ter break.
