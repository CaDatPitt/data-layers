Cost of Textbooks Expectedto

By BETSY MOMICH

The cost of textbooks is expected
to continue rising, and science and
engineering students will be hit
especially hard, University Book
manager Mary Bonach said.

The Book Center, the sole dis-
tributor of textbooks for Pitt, has
increased its prices almost 7 per-
cent since l98l. Bonach said that
the prices of science and engineer-
ing textbooks aie increasing at a
greater rate.

"The greater the technical con-
tent in the text, the greater the costs
will be in printing,” Bonach said.

Pitt’s prices, however, are actu-
ally below‘the national average.

 

The National Association of Col-
lege Stores reported that the cost of
an average textbook in I982
increased 10.9 percent. Increases

for individual college publishing
firms ranged from 6.6 percent to as
high as l8.5 percent for W.W. Nor-
ton Publishers.

WPGH
Still
Waiting

Pitt radio station WPGH’s
attempt to get on the FM dial is
likely to take longer than expected,
but Pitt officials remain optimistic
that the move will eventually be
approved.

The student-run station is cur-
rently a carrier current system and
broadcasts through telephone
broadcast loops to the residence
halls and Student Union.

Pitt has been pursuing the idea
of an FM station since 1977, and
amended its application this past
spring because of conflict with
other stations. Instead of applying
for an educational license on a tra-
ditionally educational band, Pitt is
now applying for an educational
station on the FM commercial
band.

That type of request has never
been granted before by the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC). In addition, personnel cut-
backs at the FCC have created a
backlog of cases, which is holding
up a decision on Pitt’s request.

But student media adviser Larry
Lunsford believes the station has a
good chance of being approved.

“There's at least a 50-50 chance
that this precedent-setting request
will be granted,” Lunsford said.

It is still uncertain when a final
decision on the Pitt request will be
made. When Pitt originally filed
for space on the FM dial in 1979, its
request conflicted with those of
Carnegie’-Mellon’s radio station
and Bethany’s station.

Pitt tried unsuccessfully to nego-
tiate with the two schools. It origi-
nally proposed that CMU move its
location on the dial from 88.3 to
88.9 and that Bethany use a direc-
tional antenna aimed away from
Pittsburgh, or that Bethany and
Pitt accept mutual interference
around Washington, Pa.

However, CMU was unwilling
to move its position on the band
because it feared interference from
Pittsburgh station WQED.
Bethany rejected using the prop-
osal of using a directional
antenna.

Increased lal)or and supply costs
are blamed for t.he rising prices.
According to University Press Pub-
lishers, the cost of paper has
doul)led in the last five years, and
printing prices have increased 15
percent.

“I do not expect textbook -prices
to ever level off," Bonach said.

For Pitt students, there are few
alternatives. According to the man-
ager of Jay's Bookstall in Oakland,
the textbook market isn't a lucra-
tive one for bookstores.

“The textbook market is too
exclusive. The prices are getting
too high and the return is very
low," he said.

While the schools were at an
impasse in their negotiations,
Channel 6 in Johnstown was try-
ing to reach the Pittsburgh market
through the cable network. Pitt’s
FM application presented the
threat of possible interference with

if the broadcasts into Pittsburgh.

Channel 6 complained to the
National Association of
Broadcasters.

That association filed a com-
plaint with the FCC on behalf of
Channel 6. The FCC then ordered a
freeze on all applications, includ-
ing Pitt’s within a certain broad-
cast range of Channel 6.

That freeze is still in effect. But
after Pitt amended its application,
figuring that Channel 6 would win
its request, CMU lawyers wrote the

cated that they are also likely to do

Most people probably
remember their orientation to
college life at Pitt. Time was set

‘ aside and programs were held
just for their benefit. To help
the freshmen and new students
find their way around the large
urban campus. a mentor pro-
gram was developed by the

()ffice of New Student
Programs.
According to Bob Firth,

director of the program, a men-

man who works with new
students over the summer and

, the end of the summer to get
them oriented to college life

The mentors help students
find their way around campus,
answer questionsaboutcampus
activities and classes and are
supposed to be role models for
the new students.

Firth said that although the
mentors help the new students,
the mentors also learn about
themselves and others.

“The mentors /start to think

tor is a volunteer upperclass— .

about what they want out of the
university," Firth said. “They
start to ask alot of philosophi-
cal questions.”

In addition to orientation,
mentors also visit their own
high schools to relate the col-
lege experience to juniors and
seniors who are confused or cur-
ious about college. They also
hold a “Provost‘s Day," which
is a preview of college for high
school juniors.

The first day of the new ‘‘

recruitment for next summer's
mentors will be Oct. 6, Firth
said. Applications will be avail-
able at 738 Schenley Hall for all
upperclassmen interested in
being mentors.

The announcement will l)e
made in early November, in
time for the students chosen to
sign up for Firth’s own orienta-
tion class.

The class is a two credit
course that teaches the new
mentors what is expected of
them and the fine art of being a
mentor. —

Getting a government-backed student
loan or grant is hard enough, but to add an -
extra worry, there’s now a move underway
to make it even harder to keep one.

The push is on in Congress to require
recipients of government-backed financial‘
aid to maintain a C-average or lose the aid.
Under this bill, called the Nickles-Pell
"plan, students who don’t meet with the C-
average standards would have one addi-
tional grading period to boost their grades
before being cut off and forfeiting the aid.
After that rejection, the student would have
to earn at least a C-average for two consecu-
tive grading periods to qualify for the aid
again. The government is not without .
mercy, however, and there will be excep-
tions made for extenuating circumstances
such as a death in the family or an illness.

The bill’s inspiration comes from a
recent General Accounting Office report
which concludes that approximately 20
percent of students now receiving aid do not
meet the minimum academic standards.
While the bill’s intention is punitive, it is
also a way to cut down on the money ear-
marked for students.

Considering that 7 million students will
claim $7 billion in‘ aid this year, the C-
vaverage cut-off point would save the
government around $1.4 billion if the GAO
is correct in both its methodology and fig-
uring. That’s a big “if.” .

The GAO’s deduction that 20 percent of
students are under par was arrived at by the
examination of 5,800 student transcripts
from 20 colleges across the country. Differ-
ent colleges, however, often have different
grading systems and standards which the
study could not have taken into account. In
addition, if saving money is the goal here,
this further federal monkeying in the inter-
nal affairs of universities will ring up its
share of costs connected to the extra red
tape, paperwork and office staff needed to
keep it all straight. 5 5

Academic progress is too subjective a way
to determine financial aid awards. Another
decisive factor is already available on a
much more credible basis-—student need.

Rush And Pledge Ideas
From A Caveman’s Wall

By MARK A. SINDLER

Upon entering the opportunity-
filled world of college life, each
freshman is confronted with the
option to go Greek.

Fraternity and sorority life can
greatly enhance social relation-
ships and the ability to get along
productively with others. It may
also establish a camaraderie that

— endures for years.

These. benefits may be obvious to
the first-time student, but what is
not so evident is the actual work-
ings of the Pitt IFC Rush Program.

Simply put, ' it needs to be
reorganized.

Among its many shortcomings,
which is putting it mildly, is the
short duration of Open and Closed
Rush. The combined rushing peri-
ods only give students three to four
weeks time to decide which frater-

C nity or sorority to pledge. _

How is it possible for each group
to determine which students have
the qualities necessary to uphold
its traditions and ideals?

It is virtually impossible, given
only one month of rushing. The
Greeks here seem only to be con-
cerned with attracting freshmen,
doling out drinks to impress them
and then signing themup to fulfill

‘ quotas.

Another negative aspect of the
Greek system is the intense concen-
tration of partying during Sep-
tember. It might even be added that
the university administration has
turned a blind eye to this.

With social functions occurring
almost every night, howis it feasi-
ble for a freshman who has just
entered a new enviroment to form
any study habits? However, a fresh-
man cannot determine which
Greek group is tailored to his tastes
unless he spends a considerable
amount of time getting to know the
members.

Perhaps Pitt’s admininstration
is too preoccupied to realize this or
it doesn’t really care. Fraternities
are not under university
jurisdiction.

And now comes the clincher. If it
is not enough that freshmen fall
behind in assignments, can much
more be accomplished during the
Fall term pledging period? Assum-
ing a pledging lasts eight weeks
(anything less doesn’t deserve to be
called pledging) this accounts for a
huge portion of Fall term.

Pledging requires a‘ lot of time
and is not compatible with the
amount of time a freshman needs
to adjust to college life.

If pledging at Pitt is a breeze, and
the Greek societies don’t care who

they enlist, the Greek system can-
not represent much of anything.
Members only wish to have quan-
tity instead of quality.

Now, for every problem there
must be a solution. This case is no
exception. In fact, the solution is a
simple one.

0 Extend rushing over the entire

Fall term. Give freshmen time 

get to know brothers and sisters at
all the fraternities and sororities.
Winter break will give them time to
make a final decision.

0 Limit partying to weekends
only.

0 Have pledging only occur dur-
ing Winter term.

Sure, these proposals sound like
they came off the wall of a primi-
tive cave, but they come from a

-school of thought that maintains

Greek life should be a relationship
among people who share a strong
unity.

Greek life should not be a group
of individuals who identify with

4 

two or three Greek letters becauseﬁa)
they happen to know several peo- A

ple in that group.

All Reagan Team Accomplices

By DANA REED

In reply to Scott Rex’s Sept. 20
column, “Nuclear War: Where is
the Evidence,” might I say that per-
haps Mr. Rex hasn't searched very
far beyond The Pittsburgh Press
for his evidence or his argument.

In regards to Rex’s claim that
Congress did not approve Reagan’s
cuts in student aid,, he is partially
correct. This is an election year,
and with an intense public outrage
at the proposed cutbacks coupled
with 5,000 students lobbying last
March 1 on Capitol Hill, they did
not give Reagan everything he
wanted. They did cut‘ certain
programs—student Social Security
benefits, Work-Study, Pell
grants—tightened' eligibility and
put budget ceilings on all
programs.

Congress also passed legislation
affecting many veterans like Mr.
Rex, under which veteran’s educa-
tional benefits are classified as
straight financial aid, regardless of
their income or need. According to

_ an Aug. 30, 1982 'Washington Post

article, 25,000 out of 89,000 eligible
veterans may lose Pell grant aid
totaling more than $25 million
dollars.

Congress, made up of both
Republicans and Democrats, has
also given Reagan everything he
has wanted—from his tax cuts for
corporations and cuts in social pro-
grams to his bloated defense
budget. All the politicans are to
blame.

While all of us have been under
attack from the Reagan adminis-

. tration, we have also had to con-

tend with the slashers in
Thornburgh's and Pitt’s adminis-
tration, whose decisions also affect
the future of our educations. We
must not overlook the fact that the
majority of financial aid for Pitt
students comes from the state of
Pennsylvania in the form of
PHEAA grants and student loans.

Rex’s claim that there is an over-
abundance of “I'm angry at the
government” feelings is untrue. In
fact, there aren't enough. When
Rex speaks of the government, he
must not forget to take into
account the Thornburgh adminis-

tration, the Pitt administration
and Board of Trustees, and our
own student government. They are
all accomplices of the Reagan
team.

It seems that the only organized
opposition to these attacks are the

“leftist" students in the Progressive
Student Network (PSN) who, as
Rex foolishly proclaims, do not
want to “convert the converted,”
but rather want to raise student
awareness of these attacks and their
relation to the bloated defense
budget and Reagan’s war drive.
Rex’s statement that Reagan has
been able to achieve what Carter
had not, in seeing that no Ameri-
— can soldier has died in”combat, is
also partly correct, for the time
being. Reagan has been in office
less than two years. He has brought
us the largest military build-up in
our nation’s history and a Cold
War_ mentality we haven’t seen in
the White House since the likes of
Harry Truman.

Only public pressure, expressed
at the brutal murders of four U.S.
missionaries in El Salvador and by
more than 100,000 people protest-
ing the threats of U.S. intervention
on May 3, 1981 and 50,000 protest-
ing again on March 27 of this year,
has kept Reagan from sending U.S.
troops to El Salvador.

They Are All Accomplices Of The Reagan Team

million CIA destabilization cam-
paign to intervene in the affairs of
El Salvador and Nicaragua. Given
Reagan's reliance on military solu-
tions to social and political prob-
lems and his willingness to use
U.S. troops in Lebanon, we cannot
rule out a military adventure by
Reagan. Rex’s analysis is too
simplistic.

Rex’s reasoning that by getting
rid of Al Haig that we can now
forget about a nuclear war waged
by the Reagan administration is
utterly absurd. Obviously, Rex
thinks that just by ‘changing faces
we can forget about Reagan’s
“winable” and “limited” _nuclear
war strategies. Reaganhas now
gone beyond Carter’s Presidential
Directive No. 59 and has initiated
plans to win a six—month “pro-
tracted” nuclear war, all this com-
ing after the resignation of Haig.

Rex also forgets that many
viewed Haig as a moderate
amongst reactionaries like Tho-
mas Enders and Dean Hinton.
Haig was not the only one who
dictated State Department policy
and formulated the “limited”
nuclear war. strategy. Defense

of the National Security Council
were mainly responsible for this
strategy, and they're all still there.
Schultz has only been in office
since June and has already taken
part in nuclear policy.

Rex’s claim that the last time
atomic weapons were dropped was
under a Democratic administra-
tion insinuates that under a
Republican one we have nothing
to worry about. This assumption is
ludicrous. Since WW II, on numer-
ous occasions, both Democratic
and Republican administrations
have threatened to use nukes.
Examples are Kennedy during the
Cuban missle crises and Nixon
during the Vietnam War.

Rex’s statistics in regard to the
June 12 disarmament rally are a bit
understated. New York City police
estimated that more than 800,000
people took part. This was the
largest demonstration in our
nation’s history and we must not
look solely on its numbers to see
the historical impact of this action.
For the first time, a diverse group of
organizations—from the church

  
        
    
       
    

 
       
     
 

  
 
 
   

    

and civil rights groups to anti—war
groups—carne together to demand
an end to nuclear weapons and that
the Reagan administration cut the
military budget to fund human
needs.

Rex’s claim of “empty rhetoric”
is also unsubstantiated. The proof
is in front of his eyes in black and
white. Funds are being cut from
higher education and social pro-
grams to stage the largest war
build-up in our nations history.
Therefore, the PSN and others
demand that the military budget be
cut in order to fund human needs
and that Reagan end his corporate
giveaways. Are these concrete solu-
tions or “empty rhetoric?"

Rex’s plan that we join the
Marines is another example of his
off-handed and absurd ideas. The
Marines are a tool of U.S. foreign

and corporate policy historically
used to intervene in Third World
countries to protect U.S. business
interests——'from Vietnam and Iran
to the Dominican Republic.

We do care about our country.
The PSN is a national network of
r

—-Page 5

student activist groups working for
positive social change. The PSN
hopes to unite the various seg-
ments of the student movements in
order to arrive at coherent and
responsible means for altering our
society: ,__

We feel that we can no longer
look to the old answers as solu-
tions; we must develop new visions
for our social order. We must work
towards a society based on demo-
cracy, equality and political partic-
ipation that fits the dreams and
desires of all Americans.

June 12 was a victory. It was a
start of a new social and political
mass movement. Simon and Car-
funkel are part of that mass move-
‘ment and image of the fight for
peace and equality.

Scores Up

Scores on college entrance
exams are up for the first time in
19 years, according to the Col-
lege Board.

_ The Board also reported that
80 percent of all incoming
freshmen need financial aid.

The 1982 SAT increase
amounts to three points—two
points in verbal and one in
math. But this year's increase is
stilll considerably lower than
the average scores in 1963.

The increase could be caused
by students being coached on
how to take the test, some acade-
micians say.

The SAT verbal average rose
from 424 in 1981 to 426; the
math average went up from 466
to 467. The SAT is given to
approximately one million col-
lege bound students annually.
According to the College Board,
76 percent of the 1982 group
planned to apply for financial
aid.

The College Board also
reported that the most dramatic
growth in intended field of
study was computer science,
and declines were noted in edu-
cation, social studies, health
and medicine.

“Library Tape

An audio tape “walking
tour” of Hillman‘Library is
now available for parton use.
The tour can be charged out
through the Information Desk
on the ground. floor of the
library during the hours that
the desk is staffed (Monday-
Friday 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sat-
urday 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.,
Sunday noon to 10 p.m.).

The patron will receive a por-
table tape recorder, earphones
and a tour guide booklet with
floor maps. V

The walking tour, approxi— .
mately one hour in length, is
equivalent to a general build-
ing tour covering all floors.’
within Hillman Library. The
patron is given basic instruc-

A tion on the use of the card

catalog and the periodical indi-
ces as well as the location of
materials and services within
Hillman Library.

Use of the walking tour is
encouraged, especially by those
who are unable to participatein
a regularly scheduled building
tour.

PISO Group

How are Americans thought of
in Europe? How hard is it for some-
one from the Mideast to adjust to
living in Oakland? What kinds of
prejudices do foreign students face
at Pitt? ‘ ~ 

Pitt’s International Student
Organization (PISO) offers both
American and foreign students the
chance to exchange cultural ideas.
Comprising 100 members, the
group sponsors a lecture series that
features Pitt faculty members and
other qualified persons who speak

on world events such as the Poland ‘

crisis and Reagan’s Middle’ East
policy.

In addition PISO sponsors an
international festival each spring
of arts and crafts from different
countries, along with ethnic foods
and dancing.

Belayet H. Khan, the president of
PISO, said his group is facing
some problems with funding. The
group is partially funded by the
Student Government Board and
the Office of International Student
Services. '

State Police have reported
thefts of automatic bank teller
cards from State Office
buildings.

The thefts occur during
breaktime when employees are
away from their work areas.
The thefts have been performed

by a man and a woman. The
victims are unaware of the theft
until they receive a phone call
from a person identifying him
or herself as a bank officer and
telling the victim that the bank
_ believed there had been a fraud-

ulent use of his automatic teller _

—Page 7

cards. When the victim checked
and found the cards missing,
the suspect (alias bank officer)
then asked for the confidential
identification numbers in order
to cancel the cards.

If you experience a similar
incident, do not give your cor-
rect identification number

The Endless Roads of Pittsburgh

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

Thomas Paine once wrote,
“These are times that try men’s
souls.” These words were

spoken during the troubled
times of the American Revolu-
tion. They can also be applied _.
to Pittsburgh’s troubled times

of PennDot’s construction
throughout the metropolitan
area. ' ’ »
To the "commuters . of the
area, downtown Pittsburgh has
become a man-made purgatory
that seems to have no end in
sight.

To anyone who has had to go
through the downtown area
recently, it becomes readily
apparent that the streets have
brought the game “chicken and
dare” to a new level. If you
happen to travel by car down
Liberty Avenue, the stress on
shock absorbers and axles
exceed that of any car manufac-
turer's factory tests.

 

The question asked by some
Pittsburghers is why on all the
new car commercials do they
show the car climbing moun-
_tians of bricks, crossing the
rocky terrain of the desert and
cruising over four-by-four
boards, but never, never; do
they show a car traveling over
Pittsburgh’s roads. But looking
at the cars that have survived
the roads of Pittsburgh, it is no

wonder that none of them are

shown in any commercials.
People have been seen shoot-

ing their cars on the open street

to protest what they call the
“inautomobile condition” of
the area’s highways.

“My car had a busted axle,
two flats and three gas tanks
broken by pot holes. I thought
it would be best to put the car
out of its misery. Itjust couldn’t
take the pounding anymore,"
said one man after shooting his
car. .

Already agencies have begun
an all-out effort to stop what
they term “reckless and deplor-
able destruction of cars. The

SPCA (The Society for Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Automobiles)
has been inundated with calls
reporting mass shootings of
sick and dying cars. The agency
has sent its lobbyists to Harris-
burg to see if state funds can be
obtained to help people main-
tain their cars instead of having
to shoot them.

The Humane Society has
reported that instead of bring-

- ref’

 

  

ing cats and dogs to area shel-
ters to be put to sleep, people
have been bringing their cars in
the searchfor a humane and
decent way of ending it all. As
of yet, there has been no method
devised to ending a car’s life
humanely, but testing is
continuing.

The mosrexasperating part
about the downtown construc-
tion is how to get to where you
want to go. This past Saturday
evening proved ot be a sur-
preme exercise in finding the
correct" roads to take to get to
Oakland. A better way of stat-
ing this might be “the correct
series of roads."

    
   

ii»

Since the Fort Pitt Tunnels
were closed to inbound traffic,
they had to be circumnavigated
using the West End. bridge to
cross the Ohio River, circling
North Side and traveling past
the stadium. Another bridge,
had to be crossed in order to go
over the Allegheny River which
leads to the downtown area.
Then, to get to the Parkway
East, the ramps, which are pres-
ently under construction, are
bypassed by a road that travels
under a bridge that leads to the
Parkway. This route takes 25
minutes-—under normal (nor-
mal?) circumstances, the trip
would only take five. Is itany
wonder that people have started
to ask what is going on?

Favorite among travelers is
the now infamous Parkway
East. The mass construction,
now in its second year, has
played havoc with nerves and
time tables alike.

There are stretches of the
road that are single lane both
ways, then single lane one way
and two lane the other. Ramps
are being opened and closed at
shutter rate speed. '

Commuters have had to leave
their homes as much as 30 or 45
minutes earlier in order to
make it to their destination on
time. The cutting of cars in
front of each other, the bumpy
roads and the honking of horns
have led to frustrations beyond
description.

The most amazing part
ab"oi’ut this behavior is the atti-
tude that sacrificing a life is
irnportantiithan saving a few
seconds by swerving in front of
other cars. In a recent accident
on the Parkway, ambulances
were prohibited from getting to
the accident scene by motorists
who blocked the lane cleared by
policee, specifically for the
ambulances. Fortunately, the
ambulances did -get to the vic-

ea

 

tims, but it was only with the
help of forceful policemen that
the way was cleared for them.

The people of this area seem
to have grown accustomed to
the condition of the roads.

Indeed, Pittsburgh is acclaimed
by its residents as the “Pothole
Capital of the World.” In Oak-
land the roads are not noticed as
much in other areas because of
the large number of students
and faculty who walk to the
university, -but to those brave
enough to venture outside to
secure perimeters of the univer-
sity, it is readily seen that all is
not well.

“It would appear that Penn-
Dot, having been so long bat-
tered with accusations for lack
of responsibilitiesof the area
roads, is now seeklng its
revenge,” says a local commut-
er. “The least they could do is to
make it a quick revenge.”

If there is indeed a revenge
being conducted by PennDot, it
appears that it is concentrated
in the slawntawn area; It mast
be said that‘PennDot is not the
only one involved in the down-

— town region, l)ut, with the con-

:»

struction of buildings by
companies in the area, it has
helped to put the crunch on the
commuter.

PennDot’s -work not only
includes road repair, but also
the building of a subway system
that has decimated roads once
traveled by _all. To make it
worse‘ the construction has
added to the noise pollution of
the downtown area. To say
“These are times that try men’s
souls” might have been incor-
rect. Maybe it should read,
“These are times that try com-
muters’ souls.”

CHAMPAIGN, I1l.——It was
appropriate that in a city named
,after bubbly wine, Pitt’s defense
put forth a sparkling effort last Sat-
urday, shutting down Illinois’
high-powered offense, 20-3.

In fact, it was the defense that
scored Pitt’s first six points, stole
the momentum from the Illini and
hushed 71,547 spectators at Mem-
orial Stadium.

With Illinois" leading 3-0 in the
second quarter and in possession of
the ball at-the Pitt two-yard line,
Panther defensive tackle Dave Puz-
zuoli snatched a Tony Eason pass
and hobbled 95 yards for the
touchdown. I

“I was just waiting for someone
to catch me," an exhausted Puz-
zuoli said after the.game. “I was
tired——running 100 yards wasn’t
what I expected.

“I was chasing Eason and he
threw the ball right at my chest,”
Puzzuoli explained, short of
breath. “Once I reached the 20, I
knew I’d get in.”

The crunching block that ].C.
Pelusi threw at the Illini 35, also
assisted Puzzuoli in his journey.

“All I remember was that ].C.
was right beside me when I inter-
cepted the pass,” Puzzuoli said.
“Coach was yelling at me to take
my time and run out the clock. I
saw nothing but green in front of
me.

“I once ran a 4.9 40-yard dash,”
joked the 255-pound lineman.
“I’ve put on some weight since——l
was seven at the time.” ,

Pitt's defense was no joke to the
Illini offense, for numerous
reasons: V

0 They held Illinois——a team
which entered the game averaging
39 points a contest—to just a first
quarter field goal.

0 They intercepted Eason, who
is considered by many to rank
alongside Panther quarterback
Dan Marino and Stanford’s John
Elway in talent, five times.

0 They shut down the run com-

pletely, holding the Illini to -27
yards on the ground. Illinois
attempted only one run during the
entire second half.

0 Eason was_ sacked nine times,
for -83 yards. He would have been
sacked at least 10 more times, had
he not tossed the ball away to avoid
the pass rush.

0 At one point, Illinois needed
46 yards for a first down. The Illini
converted just 5 out of 19 third
down attempts.

O Pitt’s offense sputtered also.
Marino was intercepted four times,
two of them coming as the Panth-
ers neared Illinois‘ end zone.

0 The lone offensive touchdown
came in the third quarter. Marino
hit split end Julius Dawkins for six
yards at the Illinois 43, then hit
flanker Dwight Collins for 13
yards; After a sideline pass to Daw-
kins for six more and a nine-yard
run by tailback Bryan Thomas,
Marino found tight end John
Brown slanting over the middle for
the touchdown. ,

Initially, Pitt’s game plan was
directed toward ball control, for as
coach Foge Fazio said, “We tried to
keep the ball away from them, but
it ended that they kept it from us."

That strategy changed in the’
second half when Thomas, who

carried the ball 14 times for 69 yards

in the first half, rushed only four
times for 11 yards.

“We used the run in the first half
to soften their defense,” Fazio said.
“We wanted to set up the pass."

Illinois, on the other hand, had
no disguises. From first to last play,
the game plan was to pass. And
pass they did. Eason threw 58 times
for 275 yards, but he was unable to
put a touchdown on the board.

“We tried to throw a few draws
in there to get their attention and
let them know this wasn’t going to
be an aerial circus,” deadpanned
Illinois coach Mike White. “We
took a calculated game plan
approach to Pittsburgh, realizing
that we had to live and die by the
pass against a physically superior
team.

Panther running back Bryan Thomas gaining some of his 82 yards rushing during
Pitt’s 20-3 victory over Illinois Saturday at Champaign.

“Our inability to move the foot-
ball and protect the quarterback
was our downfall.”

Fazio had only the offense to
complain about. “If I’m disap-
pointed with anything, its the
offense,” he said. “The offensive
line protected well, but we need
some consistency. We’ve played 12
quarters now, and we don't have
consistency. 

“But give credit to the Illinois
defense,” Fazio added. “They were
prepared. They changed coverages
well and the secondary played
exceptionally well.”

Fazio was pleasedi with the
defense, saying. “The game was

won _up front. ‘We were very
physical—especially Chris
Doleman—and we put great pres-

accounted for three sacks.

Said Puzzuoli, who also had thre
sacks, “After giving up 17 points
against Florida State last week, we
weren’t very happy. We questioned
what we could do. We proved today
that we do have one of the best
defenses in the countrv.”

.“I felt sorry for Eaison,” Fazio
said. “He was really getting hit.

Our defense was dedicated to win- ~

ning the game—I knew that when
we left the lockerroom.”

White was equally pleased with
his team’s defense, ‘saying, “This
might just have been the best defen-
sive effort since I’ve been here. The
defense provided opportunities

early. We not only didn’t capital-
ize, but we gave them a touchdown
on that long interception return. It
was just too much to expect from
the defense.”

But not too much to ask from the
Panther defense, especially in a city
like Champaign.

The Pitt News, Monday September 27,’l982

Lady Panthers Spike Nation’s Best

By MARK A. SINDLER

He said this was the biggest wee-
kend in Pitt volleyball history. He
said the Pitt Classic reflected an
unbelievable accomplishment. He
also said nothing better had ever
been accomplished by a women’s
volleyball team. ls coach Shelton

Collier on cloud nine? Undoubt-

edly so.

,The women’s volleyball coach
said all of this as his squad con-
quered Penn State, Ohio State and
Tennessee. Remember the United
States’ victory over the Soviet
Union at Lake Placid? That is how
the Lady Panthers feel right now.

The 13th-ranked Nittany Lions
were drubbed 8-15, 15-12. 15-7 and
15-13. Defending Southeastern
Conference champions, Tennes-
see, took a beating Saturday 15-16.
12-15, 12-15, 15-10 and 15-11. Ohio
State proved more of a challenge,
but was ultimately no match for
the Lady Panthers, 9-15,/15-5, 15-
12, 12-15,16-14. '

The classic was the first real test
for Co1lier’s squads and it came
through in overpowering fashion.

“It is definitely a good feeling,"
Robin Kukalis said. “We never had
any doubt in our minds the whole
weekend. We were just too fired

up.

Collier was somewhat stunned
by his teams play. “If you were to
tell me beforehand we would win
all three matches at the tourna-
ment, 1 would have said you were
crazy," he said. .

“I have said many times since the
beginning of the season that our
strongest asset is mental toughness.
This is an overused cliche, sure, but
anyone who saw the three matches
this weekend would know that we
have some very special athletes
representing Pitt on this volleyball
team." ‘

Theclassic Pitt-Penn State con-
frontation was a disappointment
to State’s coach Russell Rose.
“This was the best defensive effort
for a Pittsburgh team,” he said.
“We'll be back in October and
ready."

Upon entering the..,:vOhio State
match, the Lady Panthers were
emotionally spent. For the first
three quarters of the match, the
squad was not executing very well
and concentration was not what it
had been.

Pitt played inconsistently even
though they had a 2-1 margin, but
matters got touchy when star
spiker Ulana Kohutiak went down
with a sprained ankle. In the fifth,
OSU had an 8-1 edge. When OSU
established an 11-3 lead, the
momentum switched sides.

After calling his last timeout,

-behind 14-10, Collier called the

team together and saw that “they
were prepared to control their own
destiny.”

“A couple of crushing spikes by
Robin and three consecutive stuff-
blocks by Carmen (Tapia) made
the difference as the Lady Panthers
rolled to a 16-14 comeback win,” he
said.

Captain Julie Gaul was pre-

pared for this weekend's competi-

tion. “All week, that is all we
thought and talked about at
practice—Penn State, the other
power 4 in the East. We came
through because we got contribu-
tions from everyone,” she said.
“Each person has her own respon-
sibilities; it isn’t like there are one
or two stars to look up to or fall
back on. There aren’t, not this
yearf’

“We were all pretty elated,” said
senior Diane Zack. “It was really a
good feeling. We played well
together, executed very well
together and played under pressure
exceptionally well.

“It's all because there is a special
team unity this year. It's different
than any other year."

The year the Lady Panthers are
having is an extraordinary one.
The momentum is all theirs; con-
sidering the l4-game win streak
and three consecutive tournament
championships.

Put yourself in the shoes of the
United States’ hockey team after
Lake Placid. Do that and it is easy
to understand how the Lady
Panthers feel right now.

Pitt’s Field Hockey Team

F’ Still Searching For First
Win Of The 1982 Season

1 »

September 27, 1982 _-Pest 13

By TAMMY ANDERSON

After two weeks of season play,
with games against Bucknell, Kent
State and Slippery Rock, the Lady
Panther Field Hockey Team finds
itself without a victory. However,
that 0-3 record may not be a predic-
tion of things to come in the future.

“All we need to do is get one win
under our belts and then we'll be
able to go forward from there,"
coach Cindy Baldridge said. “With
our good attitudes and practices, I
feel we can overcome our past three
loses and move on to the next game
with high hopes of victory.”

Last Tuesday, the team lost a
hard-fought battle to Kent State
University, 3-2. The Lady Panthers
fell behind early in the game when
Kent State scored on a one fast-
break. The Lady Panthers answer’-
ed back when ‘sophomore Terry
Zygarowicz flicked one past the
Kent State goalie to tie the game.
Pitt then jumped ahead when
sophomore Phyllis Kusuplos drove
the ball into the corner of the goal
to give the Lady Panthers a 2-1 lead
at the end of the.first half.

Bad weather conditions and a
few other complicating factors
took their toll on the Lady Pan-
thers in the second half. The con-
stant rain during the game affected
the play of both teams. A further
complication in the game was the
similarity of the two teams’ uni-
forms. Both teams wore thesame
kilts and socks, and both had gold
shirts. Through the confusion,
Kent State was able to capitalize on
various Pitt mistakes and score two
goals to ensure itself the,3-2 victory.

“The game was a hard one to
lose.
way,” Baldridge said. “The
weather conditions hurt our play
and the mix—up in uniforms added
further confusion.”

Baldridge said the first game
against Bucknell University was a
strong defensive game and that the
Kent State game was a strong offen-
sive one. Zygarowicz, Joann Patter-
son and Margie Hall all played
good games.

With a record of 0-2, the Lady
Panthers headed to Slippery Rock
State College the following Thurs-
day in the hopes of obtaining an
“easy” victory. After a very slow
first half, the Lady Panthers found
themselves out in front 1-0, on,a
goal by Hall. But the second half
brought a turn for the worse for the
Lady Panthers. After trying to get
things together, the Lady Panthers
lost their composure and gave up
three goals in the last 18 minutes of
the game to a strong Slippery Rock
attack.

“I think we were a little overcon-
fident about the game with

It could have gone either

Slippery Rock, because we beat
them badly twice last year. Slug-
gish play and a loss of composure
on our part enabled Slippery Rock
to come out on top,” Baldridge
said.

Although their record is 0-3, the
Lady Panther Field Hockey Team
shows promising signs for future
play. With upcoming games this
week against Indiana University,

Pennsylvania, and West Virginia
Wesleyan, however, it looks as if
the Lady Panthers will have their
work cut out for them. “If we look
on to each future game one by one
with our heads up, I feel we can be
productive through the rest of our
season,” Baldridge said.

Terry Zygarowicz has been one bright spot for the winless Lady Panther field hockey

team.

The Lady Panther tennis squad
boosted its record to 3-0 by down-
ing Robert Morris 7-2 in Friday’s
match at Trees Hall courts.

Pitt started off by taking five of
the six singles matches, with strong
showings by senior Lisa Lafuria
and junior Jody Mattioli, each
winning their matches with identi-
cal scores of 6-1, 6-0.

“It was a good team effort,” said
Coach George Dieffenbach.
“Everyone’s starting to get a better
game plan before they play."

Although number one player Cathy Jacobson lost in-straight sets to Robert Morris’
Donna Chiodo, the Lady Panther tennis team were able to handle the Lady Colonials,

Dieffenbach also praised the

Booters Find Some

Offense In

By JIM COLLINS

If there's one ingredient that is
lacking on Pitt's soccer team, it’s
scoring punch. The team is able to
move the ball downfield, but when
the ball reaches the goal area, the
team comes up empty—handed.

This was apparent in the Pan-
thers’ 3-0 win over Gannon Satur-
day. Pitt clearly dominated the
game, but had trouble scoring in
the early part.

After missing many chances to
score in the first half, John Hagen-
buch put. in the Panthers’ first goal.
Danny Zamanski _dribbled past a
defender on the left side and crossed
the ball to Hagen buch, who
headed it in the corner of the net.
The goal sparked the team and the
Panthers put more pressure on
Gannon, but was unable to score
again. The first halfended with the
score 1-0.

The second half opened in the
same way as the first half. Pitt had
many scoring opportunities, but
was unable to utilize them. One
reason for the Panthers’ final dom-
ination of Gannon was their
switch from a 4-3-3 offense to a 4-4-
2 lineup. Coach Leo Bemis
dropped one of the forwards to a
midfield position. This allowed
the forwards more freedom and let
the midfield control the play.

As senior attacker Eric Tiedke
said, “Sure it gives me more room
to move, but more importantly, it
solidifies our midfield. And who’s
complaining? We've a two-game
win streak don’t we?”

Because the forwards can roam
up‘front, the defense has trouble
guarding them. Gannon’s defense
was no exception as the Golden
Knights’ frustration resulted in the
Panthers’ second goal. Tiedke was
knocked down in the penalty area
and Pitt was given a free kick from
18 yards out. Freshman Mike Rus-
sell converted the kick to give the
Panthers a 2-0 lead.

Pitt's third and final goal came
with 25 minutes left in the game.
The Panthers had a direct kick
from 30 yards out. Russell took the
kick and passed the ball to Gary
Gaido, who directed the pass
toward the goal. Despite a great
save by the Gannon goalkeeper, the
rebound was lost and Matt Fungle
tapped the ball in for the winning
margin.

Bemis was very pleased with the
team’s play, but he said the real test
will come Wednesday when the
Panthers travel to Bethany.

“Bethany has beaten some good
division III teams and th A" are
good scorers,” Bemis said, “ t will

Pitt— WVU on Sunday...?

Once upon a time, no sporting
events were allowed on Sunday in
Pittsburgh, according to the Pen-
nsylvania Blue Laws. It’s been a
while since the Blue Laws were
repealed; since then, the National
Football League has ruled the
action on Sunday afternoons while
college football reigned over Satur-

day afternoons.

With the NFL on strike, it may
be possible for the Pitt—West Virgi-
nia game scheduled for this Satur-
to be moved
depending on how much the net-

day

The Pitt News, Monday September 27, 1982

 Sports Briefs

works are willing to offer.

Both ABC and CBS have been in
touch with Pitt about moving the
game. The bids are supposed to be
the same as for Saturday games, but
since there is no contract for Sun-
day afternoon games, the networks
can offer as much money as they
want.

Even if Pitt were to appear on
Sunday, it wouldn't affect the

number of times the Panthers can I

appear on nationwide television.
The NCAA limits a team to four
appearances on television every
two years.

There are a couple of problems.
First, if one network would win the

bidding to move the game to Sun- ~

day. the other network could select
the game for a Saturday telecast.
Since Saturday afternoon games
receive preference, the deal would
be void.

Second, Pitt will not accept a
deal to move the game if the price is
not right. According to associate
athletic director Dean Billeck, the
network would have to guarantee
the money—even if the strike
would end this week and the game
would not appear on television.
Billeck said that they wouldn't
change the game for $300,900, but,
he also said, if $1 million were
offered, it would be “fiscally irres-

ponsible” not to change the game.
The reaction of other universi-
ties to such offers have been mixed.
The University of Washington
refused an offerto change its game
on Oct. 9 with California for
regional telecast. Notre Dame has
said that it will not move any of its
games to Sunday while Texas is
looking into moving the Oct. 9
matchup with Oklahoma back one
day.
Lacrosse team debuts...

Despite the unbearable weather
conditions, the University of Pitts-
burgh Lacrosse Club made its

. debut with a 13-9 loss to the Mor-

_.s.Page l7

gantown Lacrossse Club at Trees
Hall field yesterday afternoon.

Pitt’s Jim Crothers scored the
first goal of the club’s history.
Crothers also added a second goal
and two assists. Other goals were
scored by George McCullouth
(two), Frank Brown (two), K._].
Jones, Malcolm McGinnis and
Mike Connors. Goalie Barry Bloch
was able to make 14 saves despite
allowing 13 goals.

Although the club was defeated
by_ four goals, there were some
bright spots. One of them was in
Wmmng f3C€0ffS, where Pitt was
able to control 9 of 13.
