Campus   Safety

Greeks propose new programs

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

Pitt Greeks proposed several new
programs to improve campus safety at a
meeting yesterday. '

The Greek safety committee presented
its safety proposal to representatives of
Pi'tt’s' Greek system, the Student
Government Board and university
administrators.

The proposal calls for the Greek system
to take a more active role in_ campus
safety. 4

“Any initiative we do is good. People
always say students don’t do anything.
Now they’re doing something,” Greek
advisor Bridget Guernsey said. I‘

The first part of the proposal requires
that members of Greeks Advocating the
Mature Management of Alcohol be
present atevery fraternity party. GAMMA

is an organization designed to help insure
the safety of guests at parties. '

GAMMA co—chair Craig Kwiecinski said-

members of GAMMA would watch for
excessive drunkenness at parties, make
sure signs are posted at the entrance of
the fraternity house indicating phone
numbers of the police, cabs and the
campus shuttle, the shuttle’s' operating
hours, -safe walking routes and the
location of an accessible phone.
“GAMMA ‘is there just to take care of
[guests at the party] andto make sure
nobody is stumbling home by
themselves,” Kwiecinski said. “Hopefully,
[GAMMA representatives] will organize
people to walk home in groups.”
Kwiecinski is hoping to have two male
and two female representatives at each
fraternity party.’They would be divided
into two teams. One team would stand

Oﬂicials say apazfloy to blame

By John Temple
Staff Writer

When the first of a series of Public
Safety sponsored safety workshops was
virtually unattended, Student
Government Board members and public

safety officials declared that situations

such as the student rape two weeks ago
are caused by student apathy and
ignorance.

Sergeant C. A. Grier and Officer Karen
McKee-Jones last_Thursday spoke to an
audience made up of two SGB members,
Dan Leichter and Christopher Skutches,
and two other people.

“We talked to people and they told us‘
that they don’t feel safe here,” Skutches
said. “Then we have these things and no
one shows up. What do they want, us to
go around to every room and every
apartment with a police officer and have

a personal workshop?”’
Leichter agreed. “People just don’t
care,” he said. '
McKee-Jones said that only five students

showed up at an open forum last week, ,

“And that was right after the rape.” A
A female Pitt student was raped two
weeks ago when jogging home alone

after a Saturday night fraternity party. w

The victim decided to go home alo'r'ie

‘ after a taxi she called did not show up.

“To tell you the truth, most of the
comments l’ve heard blamed the girl,”

McKee said. “lt’s ashame, because she is A

a victim.” —
' McKee—Jones added that people should
be aware of the van—call services.
Leichter agreed, “You’re playing with
odds ifyou’re walking around by yourself.
Everybody says, ‘It’s not going to happen

.Panel analyzes

rise of hate
organizations  

By Michael King
Staff Writer

Panel discussions about combating hate

'. groups and the problems faced by women

in the professional world were held in
the Pitt Law School Thursday in honor of
Cultural Diversity Day.

The first panel concentrated on the Ku
Klux Klan, its increase of power and its
targeting of Western Pennsylvania as its
northern headquarters.

Leon Hailey, head of the Urban League,
said the three main reasons hate crimes
are now flourishing are the economic
situation, the historical reference of the
younger generation and Angl o-Americans
feeling threatened.

“College students seem to have
forgotten what this whole movement of
civil rights [is about and Anglo-I
Americans feel threatened by the
changing character of American society.
[They think] it’s an undermining of a
predominantly white nation,” Hailey said.

Hailey explained that there has been a
recent shift in hate crimes so they not
only target African Americans but are

Doctor says choosing baby’s gender sometimes unethical

By Donna Pesansky
.S,‘ta_ﬂ‘ Writer

Gametrics, a technique used by couplesto
preselcct the sex oftheir baby, is unethically
abused, according to Dr. Mark R. Wicclair, a
visiting professor of medicine at Pitt.

Wicclair said patients are often falsely
informed about the true probability of su ccess.
He said the process also promotes one sex
over another.

In a lecture given on Thursday called
“Ethical Issues in (lender Selection,” Wicclair
said clients are often denied the most
important right of patient: informed
consent. ,

He said couples are given false hope.

Often they are deceived by pamphlets and
doctors who tell them that this is a proven
medical treatment and it works.

These brochures color what clients hear to
what they want to hear said Wicclair.

For example the Gametrics brochure states
that “today this procedure is widely accepted
by the scientific community.” Wicclair said,
“Maybe that’s the scientific community in
White Plains [New York] but certainly not in
Pittsburgh.”

Gametrics Limited is a company established

in 1975 that claims sex preselection can occur
by separating sperm into X and Y spermatozoa
and implanting the proper combination of
chromosomes into the ovum.

“This idea of sex preselection has been
going on for years,” said Dr. Amir Ansari,
chairperson of the Obstetrics and Gynecology
department at Shadyside Hospital, which
operates a Gametrics clinic.

On their own, women have tried altering
diets or changed timing and methods of
intercourse to produce a baby of a specific
sex, Ansari said.

“lGametricsl is a scientific approach to old
wives’ theories,” he said.

Ansari said he warns patients of the
possibility that the procedure won’t work
and claims that the hospital doesn’t make any
money, but in lab costs.

According to the Gametrics brochure, 86
percent of the clients ask for males.

Wicclair said he may be more in favor of
the procedure if it was a balanced
ratio.

But by placing so much emphasize on one
gender, the medical community is sending
negative messages out to society.

“The last thing we need is a technique that
makes more out of one sex,” Wicclair

said.

He added that historically, and even today,
people have made too much of
sexual differences, like race, sex and
gender.

There are some positive aspects to the
procedure.

, For example couples can avoid some
diseases that are passed down through gender,
Wicclair said.

But what happens if the results don’t turn
out favorably for the couple?

Wicclair said people have spent good

"money: If the procedure doesn’t work, the

mother might abort the fetus, and if the
procedure does work, the child will
have to deal with a feeling of being
unwanted.

“I don’t believe [Gametrics Limited] should
be outlawed, but I don’t think it deserves a
whole community endorsement or respect,”
Wicclair said.

“Ethical Issues in Gender Selection” was
one in a series of lectures sponsored by the
Center for Medical Ethics and the Center for
Continuing Education in the Health
Sciences. '

lectures, call 647-8517.

Pitt’s Women’s Studies Program

THE PI’IT NEWS, Monday, April 6, 1992

works to gain footing in sciences

By Rebecca Wilkins
Smﬂ Writer

Pitt’s Women’s Studies Program was
founded to recognize women’s
contributions and to increase the number
of female faculty members by making
gender issues a legitimate concern,
according to Director Susan Hansen.

“There was widespread concern here
and in other places that the interests of
women were not being served in academia
or in the rest of society, the contributions
ofwomen in all disciplines were not being
recognized, and there was too little
research being done on gender issues,”
she said.

Hansen added _that the educational
experience of women’s feelings was also
a concern. V

“What sorts of knowledge or
understanding of themselves would
women gain in places taught almost
exclusively by male faculty dealing only
with ‘dead white males’?” she asked.

In her undergraduate education, Hansen
never had a woman professor.

“These issues were just totally ignored,”

0 she said.

The women’s movement of the 19605
created an explosion of research on
gender in all different areas, Hansen
said.

However, almost all of the fields in the
humanities and social sciences are
represented in WSP. Hansen said that the
hard sciences such as biology, chemistry
and math are poorly represented.

“We have just this year added some
nursing. One of our board members is

psychology, and we have one course

being offered next term in behavioral _

neuroscience,” Hansen said. “We’re sort
of moving in that direction, but ourtradition
has been the humanities.”

WSP sponsored a lecture by Linda
Nicholson, a philosopher from the school
of education at Albany, who spoke on the
changing conceptions of gender in honor
of Women’s History Month in March.
Hansen says ’WSP is already planning

1 events for next year.

“Our speaker _lfor Women’s History
Month] will be Cynthia Enlow, who is the
author‘ of Bananas, Beaches and
Bombers,” I-lansen said. “She willlook at
the role of women in international politics
and economics.” .

Also planned for next year is a 20th
anniversary celebration —— a celebration
of Susan B. Anthony’s birthday (February
15th), a series of plays dealing with women
coming of age put on by the theater
department and co—sponsored by the WSP
and possibly a combination photographic
exhibit and week—long program dealing
with abuse and battering.

wsp would like to developafull—fledged

graduate program in the future, Hansen

said, but at the moment its main priorities
are becoming a center for gender-based
research and the faculty’s personal
research.

WSP professors are involved in research
projects ranging from studying career
aspirations of undergraduate women at
Pitt to studying femin-ist ethics, women‘
artists, women in religion, social and
economic ‘changes in women’s lives after
World War II and how state policies affect

University launches new
pollution control program

By Susan Sohn
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburghand its
Center for'Hazardous Materials Research
have launched a pollution prevention
and recycling program for the Oakland
campus.

The program aims to look for ways to
prevent waste generation from occurring
on campus. CHMR’s Program
Coordinator Angel Martin—Dias, said that
the center is looking to stop waste from
being created.

“In the past we’ve looked at lwastel
after the problem is already there. Our
aim is to get at the source,” Martin—Dias
said.

The project began last fall primarily
due to a $100,000 grant from the
Environmental Protection Agency. “lThe
program] is designed to demonstrate
how a combination of an air—water-land
pollution prevention program can be

\

successfully implemented in a university
setting,” University Spokesperson Bob
Reteshka said.

As part of the program, academic
departments of the university are being
reviewed to see how much waste they
produce. Martin—Dias said that overall
the center is pleased with its findings
thus far. 4

In particular, the chemistry department
has shown that a limitation of waste
generation is a constant practice. This
involves every thing from the “path of
materials [used] to the time it is out the
door,” Martin—Dias said. .

' The university is not the only variable
in the program. Since it is difficult to
separate the city from the campus, Pitt’s
plans to educate the local businesses
_and residents is already underway,
Martin—Dias said. ‘

Future plans for CHMR include
pollution awareness and education on
ways to, prevent waste generation.

Ways to prevent future incidents will be

Thursday’s meeting, the public safety
officers explained the structure of their
department, gave tips on personal safety

Grier said that since the rape more
officers have been posted on the hill and
the van-call service has been beefed up.
He said that campus police officers can be
called to give someone a ride who is stuck
somewhere after 4:00 a.m., when the
service ends for the night. I '

Pitt’s Greeks presented a check
for $125,000 dollars to United
Cerebral Palsy Saturday night at
the Greek Week formal.

The Greeks surpassed last year’s
total by over $21,000 dollars.

“We didn’t set a goal except to
raise more money than last year.
I’m really proud of everyone’s
efforts,” Greek Week Business
Manager Nicole Lazarus said.

UCP Director Jan Bayfield was
on hand to receive the donation.

“We want to thank you for this
fantastic and stupendous effort,”
she said.

UCP client Bill McDowell said
the Greeks “truly are our friends.”

“We have a saying at UCP:
‘UCP is a community where each
belongs,’ and you’re a part of
that," McDowell said. “The money
you have raised can make other
people a part of the community.
That’s what we’re all about 
community.”

Awards were also given to the

weren’t sure exactly what that
place would be,” Delta Delta Delta
member Lori White said.

“I think more so than any other
year, we just wanted to do our
best in all of the events and have
fun. We just tdok it one event at
a time.”

Phi Delta Theta was the
fraternity that won Greek Week.

“I think a lot of what helped us
improve was we had a lot more
guys. The guys we did have put
a lot of heart and soul into the
effort. No matter what had
happened, [G reek Week] brought
us closer together, and the trophy
is secondary,” Matt Hollen, Phi
Delta Theta’s Greek Week
chairperson said.

“People should take their hats
off to Phi Delta Theta,” Greek
Week co-Chairperson Reid Sadler
said. “They really got their act

together for Greek Week. They
jumped 12 places from last year
and won the Most Improved
Chapter.”

The Inter-Fraternity Council and
Panhellenic Association also
presented awards Saturday
night.

Sigma Chi won the Cathedral
Award, which is awarded to the
most outstandingfraternities and
sororities on campus. Sigma
Chi member Denny Jones
attributed the award to Matt
Razvillas. '

“Matt Razvillas did one of the
most excellent jobs putting the
application together,”Jones said.
“Also we don’t win everything,
but we’re always in the top
three.” ' _

Sigma Chi member Erin Walker
said what makes Sigma Chi the
best chapter on campus is the

diversity of its members.

“We have such a wide array of
talents,” he said. “That’s what
holds us together.”

Two sororities, Chi Omega and

Delta Delta Delta., won the

Cathedral Award.

White said what makes Delta
Delta Delta the best is the
continuous effort of its
members.

“It’s not any one thing in
particular  part of it stems on
the fact that we’re always looking
for ways we can improve,” White
said. “Even ifa program is good,
we look for ways we can build
upon what we have. lt’s the
constant effort by everyone in
the chapter.”

Chi Omega member Jennifer
Fink attributed the success to
their activities.

“Our activities on campus are

amazing,” Fink said. “Every sister
is required to participate in two
activities outside of the sorority,
and our internal [programs], like
sisterhood retreats [and] big and
little sister program. Coming off
of probation last year, we worked
real hard this year to prove
ourselves again.”

Awards were also presented
for outstanding Greek man and
woman. Phi Gamma Delta
member Brent Saunders, who is
the former Student Government
Board president and recent
winner of Omicron Delta Kappa’s
Senior of the Year award, was
named Greek man of the
year

Sandra Kramer of Alpha Epsilon
Phi and Stephanie Myers of Delta
Delta Delta were both
named Greek woman of the
year

By Kellie Burkett
Stuﬂ‘ Writer

In l990 it was reported that there were over
one million more people on food stamps than
there were in 1989.

It was also reported that there were two to five
-million children going hungry each day.

Although Pennsylvania’s total grant donation
to state and local food banks ranks fifth in the
country, the state rate ofchildren born to unwed
mothers — a category that makes up a large
percentage of the populations needy people -
was higher than the country average.

' placed all over campus and the local medical
centers from April 7 through April 9 for the
university’s annual Scouting for Food drive said
Dennis Donham, assistant vice president of
student affairs.

Students and faculty are asked to place food
or household items in any box on campus. The
items will be distributed to food banks locally
and all over Western Pennsylvania.

The drive, part of a national effort, is a
collaboration of the Boy Scout Council in Western
PA and the United Way. The university has been
participating in the project for over five years.

“'I'his area has always had one of the biggest
and best efforts,” Donham said. “Last year we
helped over 200 thousand people in area food
banks. Pitt students and faculty contributed over
75 hundred of the items distributed.”

To help counter this problem, boxes will be 9

University continues support
of Scouting for Food program

“Pitt students have always been great to
charities,” Donham said. “If every student would
look in their cabinets for that one canned good
they never used, we can guarantee somebody,
somewhere will graciously used it.”

Unlike some revenue generated by large
charities, all the items collected in this drive are
distributed, "and 100 percent of the total effort
goes directly to the needy.

“We have to realize that the needy have found
themselves in this situation usually by no choice
of their own,” Donham said. “It can happen to
anyone.”

Although food stamps are available to these
people, there are restrictions as to what can be
purchased with the stamps.

Items such as paper products and diapers,‘
along with baby foods and items high in
nutritional value — such as beef soups, peanut
butter and tuna fish, are requested by the food
banks. However, all food and household items
are needed and welcomed, Donham said.

“By being Pitt faculty and students we are
involved in an institution of higher learning
where the key words are opportunity, excellence
and success,” Donham said. “We need to pause
and think about the people without these
opportunities.”

“Each year I find myself saying that the need
is greater than the previous year’s. Although the
community participation is awesome, it's only a
token crack at the problem. It’s very simple —
everyone needs to eat.” .

I have them in there, I can arrange
them and play them any way I
want," he said.

Lansky contends that creating
the sounds is half the fun. “I like
coming up with ways of doing
things with the available
resources,” he said. “You can get
CD5 full of sample sounds but I
don’t like to do that. I like to
make my own.”

Lansky has turned his creation
ofsounds into a family affair. “It’s
an activity I’ve involved my whole
family in. I’ve done pieces with
my wife and my kids. We’ve had
a great time,” he said.

One of Lansky’s newest works
entitled “Now and Then” features
his wife Anne reading phrases
from children's stories. He said
the piece was inspired by the
“feelings of warmth and coziness”
he remembered while reading to

his children when they were

younger.

Another piece entitled “The
Table is Clear” features Lansky’s
sons “making every possible noise
one can make, using every
possible thing from the kitchen,”
he explained.

Lansky said his younger son
became so involved in the project
“he started to make all kinds of
noises with his body,” some of

which are included in the piece.
But Lansky hasn’t spent all of
his time in the kitchen. His
enthusiasm for different sounds
has led him outside his home and
onto a four-lane highway. His
piece “Night Traffic” features the
sounds of cars and trucks that
Lansky recorded while standing
“very, very close” to the traffic.‘
Lansky jokes this was one of
his more dangerous pieces
because, “I had the earphones on
backwards 
from which direction the traffic
was coming,” he said. He also
explained arranging the material
is sometimes difficult. “It’s sort of
tedious work. I would have more
hair if it wasn’t,” he jokedj
Lansky, who has completed
“somewhere between 20 and 30
computer works,” has been
composing for over 25 years.
The 48-year-old artist studied
at the High School of Music and
Art, Queens College and
Princeton University, where he is
now professor of music. As a
visiting composer at the California
Institute of the Arts, the Aspen
Music Festival and the New South
Whales Conservatorium of Music
in Sydney, Australia, his works
have been recorded onrseveral
labels including Columbia-
Odyssey, Wergo and New Arion.

I Liﬂf fetal research ban

Reproductive rights are what 750,000 Americans
demanded in Congress yesterday. With the climate hostile
to a right to privacy in the Supreme Court and the White
House, Congress is the only hope. Passing the Freedom
of Choice Act, a bill which would encode the language of
Roe v. Wade, into law, overturning the gag rule and
securing medical assistance for economically

_ disadvantaged women seeking an abortion, will be issues
facing Congress this summer and before the upcoming '

presidential election.

Pro—choice measures have failed in the Congress-over
the last four years because President Bush continues to
side with pro—illegal abortion forces. He vetoed medicaid
abortion funds for rape and incest victims, and he vetoed
legislation overturning the gag rule against health care
workers barring speech concerning abortion counseling.

But Bush’s har‘d—line veto-proof congressional edge on
reproductive rights issues is finally cracking.

Last Thursday, the Senate approved voted 87-10 in favor
of a National Institutes of Health spending bill lifting a ban
on federal spending on research involving-tissue from
aborted fetuses. _ I

Since 1988, the Reagan administration placated the pro-
illegal abortionists on the fetal research ban. They opposed
the research because, they argued, the research “promoted”
abortion. Women would get pregnant to harvest fetal
tissue, they suggested. I '

However ridiculous the claim may be, the Reagan and

Bush administration bought it and bent to the demands of
those opposed to abortion rights. This was unfortunate
because scientists have been exploring treatment and
cures for Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease,
epilepsy and leukemia. The benefits from fetal tissue,

‘whether from aborted fetuses or miscarriages, could save

lives.

Last year the House of Representatives passed similar
legislation, but the Bush administration threatened a veto.
Now the Senate has prompted the issue and put forward
a veto-proof .majority. Even traditionally anti-abortion
rights senators supported lifting the ban. Bob,Do1e of
Kansas said that “to support this research is the true pro-

life position.” A similar vote occurred during the vote to '

lift the gag rule, but this time the administration will have
to reassess its position. ‘ V

The Bush administration is out of touch on the abortion
issue. Restricting the use of tissue thatcould save lives is
not pro-life. By pursuing policiessafeguarding women’s
lives, Americans are seeking a sane policy on abortion --
consistent and fair. . A .

To deny a poor woman’s access to abortion health care
is unfair. Enacting policy without ' regard to the
consequences of illegal abortion is unfair. Lifting the ban

_ on fetal research will be the first pro-life action taken by
i this anti-abortion administration. ‘

The supermarket tabloid headline read, “Europe’s
top model has a 73~inch bust.” '

I read the story to see just how far—fetched it was.
According to the tabloid, to drive a car, the model
has to push the car seat back as far as it can go. Her
brother said her resourcefulness is a good thing.

Tabloid babble sign of the times

intentional or not. -

This tabloid said that the woman was considering
breast-reduction surgery after her modeling career
is over. I wouldn’t think that reductive surgery for
a size 60 lilil’ woman is something to debate; I
would think that it would be imperative. I wondered '_

She’ll be safer in a car accident —
she doesn’t need airbag cushions.

Sure, this is funny, but only to
a degree. Another story was about

money for the surgery, not paying

fridge and killed. And yet another _
story was about a man who was arrested for eating
someone’s bonsai tree. ‘

These stories were not funny in the least. In fact,
I heard myself saying out loud, “Oh, please.” So I
asked my neighbor what she thought. She found
more humor in the personals than in the articles.
That’s pretty sad, since most of the "personals are
real people. ‘

This made me wonder why so many people buy
these tabloids. My first thought was that the story is
supposed to be so ridiculous that it’s funny. But
according to the disclaimer in the front of the
magazine, these stories are based on truelife.

It could be that we are so compelled to read
about the gossip of the famous and the bizarre not-
so—famous because our own lives are so mundane.
"Maybe the world is so pathetic nowadays that
people have to laugh in order to keep from getting
depressed by it.

One woman was getting married for the 50th
time. Well, Elizabeth Taylor is up to 10 now.- Her
current husband had better watch out.

The story with the 73-inch chest is just down the

road from today’s society. Women are constantly
seeking breast enlargements. I didn’t watch the__

Academy Awards, but I can just imagine what was
there: Some women with overproportioned chests,
wearing push—up bras for a dramatic effect and
dresses with cleavage that resembled Elvira's
wardrobe. When Elvira was popular, everyone
thought her cleavage was funny because it was so
ridiculous. But now it seems that quite a few of the
stars are sporting that image.

This is sad if we just laugh at the pathetic nature
of society today. This is what we live in. We should
be wanting to fix it or something, not revel in the
laughter it brings. . T

The stories are just an exaggeration of. today’s
stories, so maybe the writers of these articles were
writing social satires on today’s society. But I highly
doubt it. Nonetheless, I think that the exaggeration
of real life in these stories is a satire, whether

her to model. Yet the aspiring
models on ’I\/ say they are having implants because
they’ll get paid more.

Not taking these stories seriously, I’m taking the

strong similarities to today’s society seriously. It

looks like we are laughing at the uneasiness of
today’s society. ‘

Take a lookat the former President Reagan. He
won the presidency with a platform on traditional
family values. But he was far from traditional. One"

of his daughters was married three times. Another '
. one was living with a rock star, and Nancy was

pregnant when he married her. But he’s the teﬂon
president. His scum didn’t matter to the American
public. ‘ - 4
But Bill Clinton is another story. Here’s a man
most Americans are taking seriously as president,
possibly by default. There has been a scourge of
scandal about this man. Whether true or not, we all
want to know about it, and for a while, we. al
believe it. '
V Let’s take a trip down memory-lane. The whole-
Flowers incident started with a tabloid. Do we

really think all the stories in the tabloids are false? ’

The media believed that one enough to follow up
on It.

Let’s look at another scandal. President Bush
threw up injapan at an important meeting, but it’s
not the type of scandal we want. It would have

been funny if he was someone else’s president, but .

he was ours.
We want to read abogt other people’s dirt
because it’s more interesting than our own miserable

lives. So do we feel better when we look at these '

pathetic lives and think we are better off than them?
Most people would say they aren’t better off than
them, or if they are, thenthe stars’ lives are just
more interesting. .

If our lives were as complex and miserable as
theirs, we wouldn't want to be them.

I’ll take banal over pathetic any day.

Political action commitees corrupt democratic process

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Thursday, February 13, 1992

 

A malady has struck a branch of

‘ government. The vital signs indicate that

our federal government is diseased, and
its prognosis doesn’t look promising. The
ailment is known as PAC (political-action

- committee) syndrome. It has taken

democracy out of the democratic system
of government.

In Washington and across the nation,
this disease is detrimental. We, the voters,
elect congressional representatives, but it
seems they are not representing the average
voter. As elections come and go, it’s getting
increasingly worse. Unfortunately, many
legislators are, in a sense, bought and paid
for by the astronomical amounts of

' A campaign funds they receive from vested

interests. Not only does this make for a
lack of re presentation among the electorate,
but it causes a number ofotherproblems
that have to be reformed in order for the
masses to get their government back.

Due to the fact that many legislators in
Congress have huge campaign chests,
qualified candidates are everythin.g but
shut out from the democratic process of
popular election.

’l'his situation contributes to voter apathy.
Whether it is cause or effect or both, the
prognosis is poor. Nine out of IO House of
Representatives incumbents seeking re-

election in 1990 were engaged in ﬁnancially
uncompetitive races. Their opponents
lacked the resources to run competitive
races. The outcome was that 96 percent of
the House was re-elected. Similar scenarios
exist in Senate elections.

Many legislators have “for sale” written
all over their foreheads. Political-action
committees are a

special interests, like all of the other PACS,
are becoming the big shareholders in
Congress, not the common folk.

Some proponents of the interest group/
political-action committee philosophy
claim that it is the right ofcitizens, as stated
in the Constitution, to assemble and gather
resources in order for a collective voice to

be heard a nd

buying up shares of
influence in
Congress. Voters
can feel nothing but
insulted. Our ability

addressed. I’m not
passing judgement
on or disputing
constitutional
rights. On the

nauonal and
international problems is being seriously
threatened.

Health—care reform in this country is
necessary. It’s surely not going to happen
unless some sweeping campaign—finance
reforms are implemented. Millions upon
millions of dollars in campaign
contributions .come from the medical

industry.
The same insurance companies, doctors,
hospitals and pharmaceutical

manufacturers that live offthe nearly $700

billion-a-year health-care industry are,

battling health-care reform on Capitol Hill
and at the White House. Medical industry

- contrary, PAC
regulation is not a constitutional violation.
When the influence and level of PACs’
persuasion goes unchecked, there must
be some means of monitoring their
activities. .

Limits on contributions-from interest
groups and political—action committees, as
well as spending limits for the candidates
and limits on the use of personal wealth,
are a must._

g In addition, there must, be set time
periods for campaign fund—raisi,ng. Re-
election is constantly on the minds of
legislators, and they should not be
campaigning for contributions from

election day to election day. They have
enough to do as it is.

A minority of members in Congress
have pushed for legislation calling for

-campaign-finance reform. We must.get

the others to follow. It won’t be easy
because they don’t want to part with their
tremendous PAC support. Why should
they? They might actually have to run
against ‘a real competitor the next time
around.

As the New Yorle Times put it: “The need
to restore integrity to political life is obvious.
And the best place to begin is at the top,
with a massive overhaul of Congress’
odious system of campaign financing.”
The disguised bribery has to stop. The
special favors for big supporters have to
stop. .
Those suffering from the PAC disease
are not lost causes". _It’s a self—cure process
that has to be followed by all actors
involved in the “rule-by—'the-elite” system
of campaign finance.

'We, the people, as members of a society,
call for rule of the people, by the people
and for the people. Let’s bring it back to

_ common people,’ like you and me.

Traditional sexual mores reassessea’

A few weeks ‘ago during a
phone conversation, my "mother
asked me, “Jeff, do you think l’ll
ever be a grandmother?” The
question came as a surprise, but
I understood why she asked. I’m

always telling her that l’ll never

get married. 1 think my mother is
starting to believe me.

To be honest, I’d like to be
married someday, but l’ll have to
find a woman who is patient and
understanding enough to put up
with my ideas about marriage. .

Being a hopeless romantic of
sorts, I was concerned but not
shocked when I learned the
results ofa federal agency’s survey

released in January.

The survey, conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control,
polled 11,65] high—school
students in all 50 states,

',Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico

and the Virgin Islands and asked
these students about their sex
lives. Ofall the statistics reported,
this one caught my attention most:
72 percent of 12th graders say
they have had sex.

Although there is no real way

> to make sure the numbers are

accurate, I believe from my high-

school experience that the survey .

was on target. A little bit farther
down the road, I think the number
would be close to 100 percent for
college students. Those who see
the percentage as greatly lower
are not facing reality. ‘

The significance _of my

conjecture is that there is an old '

myth still being passed down,
and that’s the idea of the
traditional Judeo~Christian
marriage.

It’s the myth that tells us‘

marriage is for two virgins who
had a celibate courtship that was
consummated on their wedding
night. This is the rare exception
and not the rule. As college
students, the chances are
extremely high that we are not
going to be the first sexual
partners of our spouses nor will

they be ours.

This reality creates a conflict
with the myth .that traditional
religion teaches.

When young women and men
get married, they often compare
their situations with the folklore
of a “perfect” marriage. The young
cou ple’s situation will always fall
short ofthe myth in comparison,
and right from the start the man
and woman are left feeling guilty
and troubled with their less—than-
perfect marriage. This is ‘a
pressure that no young couple
deserves.

J Jeff ,
Custer

Marriage is a scary thing, and it

. gets scarier every day. How can

you not be afraid of marriage
when you only have a one in two
chance of not getting divorced?
We must learn to accept the reality
of an imperfect marriage, at least
dysfunctional by the traditional
Judeo—Christian standards, and
rethink the entire’ concept of
marriage in our society
today.

One of the greatest problems
with marriage is that Americans

' are taught to bottle up and hide

their sexuality. It starts in the Old
Testament story when Adam and
Eve find shame with their bodies
and tie on fig leaves to cover their
genitalia.

We grow up fearing our sexual

desires because that’s what were
taught by traditional religious and
political leaders, the same leaders
who don’t want sex education to
be taught in schools or
contraceptives tobe made more
available to young people.

This is the kind ofthinking that
must be broken down and
changed."

I’m not saying that we shguld
all be _ running around and
screwing every person possible



with reckless abandon — in the
face of diseases like AIDS and
herpes, such behavior would be
insane.

What I am saying is that it is
ludicrous to expect people to go

‘into marriage not knowing ifthey

are sexually compatible with their
husbands or wives.

Everyone has -the right to a
healthy, satisfying sex life. If a
person enters into a marriage
only to find complete sexual
incompatibility with his or her
spouse, this person is faced with
a serious problem. People who
enter into such marriages too
often find a solution in the ugliness
of infidelity and divorce.

V So let’s tear down the old walls
around sexuality. ‘

Teach _sex education to all
young people.

Face the reality that teenagers
are sexually active, and make
contraception easily available to
them. It’s a much better alternative
to unwanted pregnancies.

Choose a compatible spouse

aftera responsible, monogamous,
sexual relationship.

Our sex lives should be
considered the natural, normal
things that they are —— not the
dirty, forbidden subjects that too
many young people learn about
through pornography and
careless experimentation because
nobody else, including parents,
would take the time to teach
them.

Hopefully I will ease my
-mother’s worries and make her a
grandmother someday. Of course
it will probably be with a woman
that I lived with for five years
before we decided to get married.
That's fine with me if it saves my

. children from a broken home

and a damaged family, problems

that an incredible divorce rate .

has inflicted upon our country
today, -

If the recent editorial’s depiction of Phi Kappa Theta’s Greek
Sing performance was accurate, then the performance was
indeed sexist regardless of Mr. Gomolak’s' opinion.

Mr. Gomolak believes that the skit was not sexist because
sorority sisters thought it was funny. (Need I point out that mere
possession of two X chromosomes does not directly translate
into feminist thought and action?) Mr. Gomolak actually seems
to confirm that the skit was sexist when he states that “sorority
members congratulated the humor in the act without even
mentioning the sexist implications.” This seems more like a
congratulation of sorority members for keeping their mouths
shut even though. “sexist implications” were so obviously
present. He wishes the Pitt News would write about “blatantly
obvious discrimination” —— in other words, subtle sexism, the
sexism -his fraternity thought was humorous, should be left
unchallenged.

‘Mr. Gomolak reproaches the Pitt News for calling fraternities
“boy’s clubs.” His demonstrated inability to recognize and
oppose glaring sexism is proof positive that fraternities can
indeed foster an anti—woman, “boy’s club" mentality. Thank
you, Mr. Gomolak, for confirming what some had once only

_ suspected.

Thomas correct on Eighth Amendment

Joshua Silverman’s March_26 column blasting Clarence Thomas’
vote on a case relating to cruel and unusual punishment would
have ‘read much differently had he actually ‘ consulted the
Constitution 

From the references to bail, finesand punishments, it is clear
that the amendment is discussing the criminal justice system. Its
intent is to limit the power of judges or statutes in setting bail
for. accused persons or fines and punishments for convicted
persons. This plain understanding of the amendment is confirmed
by its origins (in Madison’s first rendering of the Bill of Rights,
this provision is found in a section dealing with trial procedures
and the rights of accused and convicted pe'rsons),'by' its context
(the preceding three amendments all deal with trial procedures)
and by its history (the courts have so understood and applied
it for 200'years). ' .

The Eighth Amendment does not speak to the actions of
individuals outside the court system. Everyday acts of brutality
do not violate its prohibition [of] cruel and unusual punishments;

rather, such acts are addressed by common law precepts of -

reasonable vs. excessive use of force or by specific legislation
enactedat the local, state or national level. A judge or law that
sentences Mr. Silverman to a brutal beating violates the Eighth
Amendment; a thug who brutalizes him in the park does not.

Justice Thomas’ dissent in no way condones brutal behavior -

of prison guards. It simply and correctly states that such
behavior, as vile and illegalas it may be in other respects, does.
not violate the Eighth Amendment.

Poet Collins

entertains
Pitt students

By Kelli D. Herd
For The Pitt News

The temperature may. have been in the
low ’30s, but the calypso music, African
dance and poetry heard Friday evening in
the studentunion set the tone for a Caribbean
evening.

Award—winning performance poet Merle
Collins was featured at the program, which
was sponsored by the Latin American Assoc-
iation and the Black Studies Department.

Steele Impressions, with Dr. Quasie,
started the evening off with Calypso music.
After their performance the African Dance
and Drum Ensemble opened the stage for
Collins.

Collins performed several of her poems
and talked with the audience about their
origins. She said her poem, The Lesson, was
written while living in Grenada during the
time that The People’s New _Government
tried to introduce change. The poem was
written with her grandmother in mind,
Collins said, because as a child her
grandmother told her historic tales of William
the Conqueror, the fourth son of the Duke
of Normandy, but never anything about
African-American history.

Collins also performed such poems as
Callaloo, La Lucba, Africa Must Be Free and
Because The Dawn Breaks.

A native of Grenada,Collins now lives in
London where she is the editor of Watchers
cmdSee/éers. She is also the author of several
poems and a novel entitled Angel, which is

‘ based on historic occurrences in Grenada.

Hate

Continued from page 1
‘now targeting Puerto Ricans,
Asians, Jews and Indians.

Barney Oursler, from the Mon-
Valley Unemployed Committee,
said Western Pennsylvania has
been targeted by many hate
groups because of the high

‘number of unemployed people

living here and their need to
blame someone for their
unemployment.

“When you get unemployed in

I\X/estern Pennsylvania now it’s a

"fearful experience...it’s much

, easier to blame someone else in

your community for your

A problems,” Oursler said.

He explained that hate groups
like the KKK are appealing to
these unemployed people and
tell them it is the African
Americans or the Asian Americans
who are taking all the jobs. By
employing these tactics the KKK
is able to build hate in the
communities of Western
Pennsylvania.

Betty Pickett, director of the

to combat the KKK is through a
multi-cultural education of youth

pockets,” Pickett said.

Oursler said there are currently
five K'KK rallies planned

throughout Western Pennsylvania
and the only way to keep this
hate group out of our
communities is by organizing
against them.

and some of them are organized

them,” Oursler said.

The second panel was filled
with four prominent Pittsburgh
lawyers discussing the problems
encountered by women in.the
law field.

Panel moderator Barbara
\Y/olvovitz explained women
lawyers are getting jobs, but

“Moving up through the ranks of S

a company is where we are seeing
problems."

She pointed out that in the past
few years there have been some
important changes in the law
community like the creation of
the \X/omen’s Bar Association and
the revitalization of a law
committee which addresses
women’s issues in the law field.

“These are positive changes,
but there are still a lot of things
that need to be done,” Wolvovitz
said.

She said one ofthe main things
women lawyers should be
concerned with is “Breaking
through the glass ceiling that
keeps women out of the upper
echelon of law firms.”

Martha Munsche, ex-Pitt
professor, now a partner in a
major downtown law firm, said
she had the most difficulties in
her career here at Pitt.

“My most vivid negative

experiences occurred here at the
law school  there was a great
deal of hostility towards me from
the men in my class,” she said.

The men in her class felt cheated
because they thought they were
being taught by the token woman
professor in the Law School, she
said.

Attorney Carol Kowall
explained that she deals with
sexist male colleagues in a
professional way. She said any
lawyers she has to communicate
with that insist on referring to her
as, “sweetie” or “honey” will not
be granted verbal or telephone
communication with her but will
have to write her a letter.

She said after the men write a
few letters they decide it would
be easier to work through
telephone conversation, so they
end up leaving out the sexist
terms of endearment while
speaking to her on the
phone.

“Confrontation of the problem

but not in an adversarial way, is

the best approach,” she said.

Jackie Morrow, corporate
council for Giant Eagle, said she
feels it is best to have an
outrageous ‘sense of humor to
put down sexism in the work
place. _

Proposal

Continued from page I
at the door to prevent people from walking home alone, while
the other team would circulate throughout the party.

“IGAMMAI is in no way at a party to monitor it or to cut people
off from drinking. If it gets two or three people a safe way
home, then it’s worth it,” Inter—Fraternity Council external Vice
President Christopher Block said. __

The Greek safety committee also mapped out three safe
walking routes from the fraternity houses to the William Pitt
Union. The routes show the safest way to get to the WPU from
the houses on the hill, those in North Oakland and the
unrecognized houses in South Oakland.

“This is just to try to keep as many people in the same place
as possible,” IFC safety committee memberJosh Caldwell said.
The walking-route maps will be available and passed out to

every fraternity and sorority by this weekend, according to-

Caldwell.

In addition to making the maps, the committee will try to get,

more lighting along walking routes and have the campus and
city police patrol these routes more frequently. SGB member
Daniel Leichter said the two groups should work with each
other since the SGB is also working on a safe walking route.

.The committee also proposed running a van from 11 p.m.

until 3 am. It would travel from the fraternity houses to the’

WPU. The designated shuttle stops will be planned weekly
after the fraternities have registered their parties. The stops will
be determined by where the parties are located, according to
Matt Razvillas, chair of the safety committee.

The IFC safety committee also plans on implementing new
educational programs, such as Friends Educating Against Rape
(FEAR). This program was created by the social chairs of both
the Panhellenic Association and IFC, Tricia Cominskey and
Derrick St- Clair. '

According to St. Clair, the program will train five male and
five female volunteers to educate students about date rape.
They plan on implementing FEAR into Greek 101, an educational
program for Greek pledges, and to make a presentation at each
individual chapter.

“We want to start educating [the 10 people chosen to become
members of FEAR] over the summer,” St. Clair said.

There were also suggestions about what individual houses
can do to prevent safety risks. Panhellenic Association internal
Vice President Jennifer Pink suggested a buddy system for
going out. She suggested people go to parties with at least two
other friends to insure that no one is left alone. I

“If programs like that get started internally, we can help what
SGB is trying to do [about solving the problems with public
safetyl,” Fink said. .

Panhellenic Association President Lori White said about the
proposal, “We have nice people dedicated on following
through on ideas. They’re not going to stop until a program is

Jews or blacks follow that
message.

Rice also talked about racial
rumors and stereotypes and how
they hurt people.

“A lot of these rumors  they
really hurt people, whetheryou’re
‘Jewish or not, because those same
rumors were said about black
people,” he said.

Ri'ce spoke about the
importance of respect and
understanding each other.

“We should take the time out to
learn about one another’s past so
we can understand what’s

-happening here in the present-

so we can look forward to the fut-
ure,” Rice said, “because no matter
what you think, if this world
goes, we're all going with it.”
Lazerson, also known as Dr.
Laz, -is the director of pupil
personnel at the North Shore
Hebrew Academy on Long Island,

don’t want to be the only one,”
Senator Barbara McCowski of
Maryland said.

“We want to make sure no
matter what the Supreme Court
does the US congress will
guarantee our right to choose,”
said Lynn Yeakle, who is running
in the Pennsylvania democratic
primary forU.S. Senate. “I’m going
to get Arlen Specter out of
Washington.”

"Jim Mooney, a Wisconsin
representative, told women at

,the march, “we need more men

fighting for reproductive rights.”

Senator Tony Smith from Alaska
told the crowd, “Seventy-three
percent of the Alaskan population
supports a woman’s right to
choose.”

In addition to the many
politicians, pro—choice celebrities
Cindy Lauper, Jane Fonda, Susan

Faludi and 19603 band Peter, Paul
and Mary also attended the march.
Protestors at the march ranged
from infants to grandmothers, but
a large portion» of those in
attendance were from the
twentysomething generation.

College students from as far as
Michigan and Illinois turned up
to show their support for the pro-
choice movement.

‘University of New Hampshire
student Jason Mahon said he
attended the pro—choice rally in
1989, but he said the emotion
and energy of yesterday’s march
was much greater.

‘‘I think the difference will get
Bush out of office,” he said.

Ohio Wesleyan University
student Deana Thatcher said, “I
think {Bush was] counting apathy
this election year and I don’t
think they are going to get it.”

On the other side of the issue,

pro-life advocates set up a
graveyard with crosses bearing
the names of women who have
died from legal abortions. Several
demonstrators kept a silent vigil
in their memory. -

Other pro-life advocates
marched down the streets carrying
signs that demanded politicians
to stop abortion immediately.

The march comes just three
weeks before the Supreme Court
will hear Planned Parenthood 12
Pennsylvania Governor Robert
Casey.

The Pennsylvania case could
set a precedent of allowing states
more control over abortion. If
Planned Parenthood loses, states
could have the right to outlaw
abortion.

“George, look out your window -

because we are the mothers of all
the marchers,” said Florida
Senator Karen Moffit.

Baseball takes two from Providence

By Cory Walborn
Staﬂ“ Writer

Using the arm of pitcher Bill
Junker and a continuous barrage
of hitting, the Pitt baseball team
took two out of three games from
Big East rival Providence this
past weekend.

After being scorched in the first
game, 14-8, Pitt fought back and
clubbed the Friars 10-0 and 8-5 in
games two and three. The
Panthers were led by Junker in
game two. ,

Hurling a shutout, the junior
right-hander pitched a complete
game while striking out seven
and allowing ‘ only three hits.
Junker has quickly become the

Panthers’ ace with an impressive
4-1 record.

“We got a great performance
from Bill [Junker] today,” Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson said. “He
throws the ball real well to spots,
to the places where you want the
ball to be.”

While Junker did the pitching,
it was shortstop Josh Tyler doing
the hitting. In game two Tyler
had three hits, including a two-
run round-tripper, and four RBIs.
Left fielder Kurt Allen and third
baseman Greg Christman also
provided four hits between them.

In game three it was Tyler and
Allen again. They combined for
five hits but were overshadowed
by the excellent relief pitching of

first-year player Jamie Goettler.
He held Providence to one run in
the final five and two—thirds
innings and gave the Panthers 21
chance at victory. Goettler struck
out four while giving up six hits
in his relieving role.

While Pitt’s pitching seemed to
be in synch in games two and
three, the weekend started with
the Panther hurlers’ being totally
out of whack.

Providence jumped all over Pitt
pitchers Jason Rakers, Rob
Hanawalt, Fred Iriti andJosh Tyler
in game one. The Friars tallied 16
hits and 14 runs, exploding in the
bottom of the fourth with six
runs, a

“We didn't play well in the first

game; we played poor1y,” Jackson
said about his team’s early
misfortunes.

Leading Providence offensively
were designated hitterJim Foster
and shortstop Lou Merloni. Foster
was three for four with four RBIs,
while Merloni also had three hits,
two RBIs and scored four runs.

On the other side of the plate,
Pitt collected 13 hits and scored
eight times only to lose to the hot
bats of the Friars. Christman had
two RBIs, while Allen and
sophomore catcherJerry Berteotti.
contributed two hits apiece.

In game two, the Panthers held
a 2-0 lead after six innings. Then
in the seventh, eighth and ninth,

valuable to a team. With all
the importance being placed
on athleticism, Leary’s
performance against Duke
was a refreshing reminder
that what matters most is
putting the ball in the basket.
oFor the second year in a
row, the best game of the
Final Four was a semifinal.
While I’m not a Duke fan by
any deﬁnition, I was quite
impressed with the way the
Blue Devils took the full force
' of Indiana’s punch and rose
from the ashes to simply put
- down the I-Ioosiers. Resiliency
is one of the most underrated
aspects of a-championship
team.

‘-1 don’t give lMichigan
much ofa chance, and maybe
I’ll be wearing egg by Tuesday
morning. Yes, the “Fab Five”
are fabulously talented and
fabulously enthusiastic, but
they are also fabulously naive.
Witness: in the Cincinnati
game on Saturday, the young
Wolverines stubbornly
refused to alter the way they
brought the ball upcourt
against the pressing Bearcats.
Instead of going, say, away

guard Jalen Rose dribbled

‘right into the defenders and
picked up his dribble. As a_
result, Rose all but
disappeared from the game,
and Michigan coach Steve,
Fisher was saved by James
Voskuil. Voskuil’s play must
have made all the writers very
happy, because here was a
former starter (pre—l’ab Five)
coming to the rescue. Voskuil

Lee Stember’s goal with only

by defeating SUNY—Buffalo 10-9
in the championship game,
Sunday, at Carnegie Mellon’s

Greek boxing event more entertainment than sport

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

What’s the first thing you
thought when you saw the “Battle
Of The Greeks” boxing
tournament posters hanging up
around campus? What a joke!
Right?

Well, to be honest, I kind of
thought the same thing when I
saw those posters. And as I sat
ringside about 25 minutes before
the tournament was to start, it
was obvious most of Pitt thought

' the same thing.

There were about six people at
the fieldhouse with the fights

scheduled to start in less than’

one—half hour. So I decided to
walk around the fieldhouse and
see what I could turn up.

I spotted a T—shirt salesman out
front and he asked me ifl wanted
to buy a T—shirt. I said no, but he
gave me his card (it said “Rob
Mazzie—Tee shirt Distributor”) and
I asked where all the people
were. A

He said there have been three
tournaments so far this year,
taking place at Robert Morris and
Duquesne, with both places
actually selling out.

I explained to him how most

Pitt students have a habit of being
fashionably late for

EVERYTHING, whether it be a .

football game, basketballgame,
class or a party.

Mazzie, along with the

representatives present from the

Pennsylvania Amateur Boxing
Association, also stressed that this
tournament was extremely
popular at other schools with a
great deal of pageantry taking
place — from costumed boxers
to ring girls in bikinis to loud
music before each fight. Also, I
learned from various sources that
the crowds really enjoy the
matches with each fraternity
rooting furiously for its respective
boxer. _

Well the crowd picked up, and

a sign_hanging on one of the

the “Fieldhouse Fanatics” section
from Pitt's basketball season but
a sign that didn’t seem so out of

actually took place) I have to
admit there was a bit of
enthusiasm building up in the
crowd.

The first thing that usually
comes to mind when you mention
boxing is violence, right? Well
this seemed to be something
different.

Of course people hitting each
other is violent any way you look
at it, butl was assured that except
for the possibility of some bloody
noses, nobody would get hurt.
And Don Midjenovich, the doctor
that was present, assured me the
fight would be stopped the
second somebody seemed to be
getting hurt. This was the
sentiment the whole night as each
boxer wore padded headgear and
oversized gloves.

The fights were actually
entertaining, with each fighter’s
weight progressing bout after
bout. It was obvious this was not
a night devoted to violence but
actually something different.

It was an event filled with
comraderie as each boxer’s
fraternity and friends cheered him
on during the two—minute rounds,
with each fight only being three
rounds, maximum. Some
memorable instances included
one match between “Lead Fist”

Lederer and “Demolisher”
Reichman, whose respective
weights‘ combined only added
up to 25.0 pounds.

Another entertaining match was
the second bout on the card
when Greg Apen took control of
the fight early, but Bob Sabolcik
came on late.

_This fight was only one of two
that went the distance (three
rounds) but upon the decision
announcing that Apen won, half
of the crowd cheered while the
other half booed.

For a minute I actuallytthought
I was in Las Vegas and some of
these people had money on the
fight.Even though only two of
the eight fights actually went all
three rounds the entire event
took about one hour and twenty
minutes.

This seems relatively short
considerin g Chairman Lee Terkel
and Co—Chairman Aaron Brauser
of Zeta Beta Tau Fraternityhave
been planning this event since
October.

But I would say besides the 40- '

percent proﬁt that went to United
Cerebral Palsy that the .3500
admission was definitely worth
the price. The event turned out to
be much more entertaining than
was expected. '

Now that this event has come
to Pitt, hopefully with a little

polishing and a little more‘,
publicity next year, the ﬁeldhouse '

will be filled like ~Duquesne’s
gym and Robert Morris’ gym were
the month or two before. I was
assured by Terkel that it would
indeed be coming back next year

because he considered the event

a success. _

A suggestion by Tony
Tarentino, one of the judges
present from the state, was to
start the event at 8 p.m. instead of
7 p.m. and provide each boxer
with some training so they are
not falling all over the place. This

sentiment was also expressed by ’

Mike Lettrich and Mark Lovett,
two ofthe winners who said they
received no formal training and
just “winged it”. ‘

So next year, when you see
those posters advertising “Battle
Of The Greeks” boxing
tournament, and you think ‘What

a joke!’, you might want to think I

again. Ifyou‘ are expecting a real
boxing tournament with ‘real
boxers, then it will be a joke. But

"if you want a night of doing

somethingdifferentandattending
an event‘ that will give you a
couple of hours of fun and
entertainment, go see the fights.

Baseball memories of years past on opening day

A To half-baked baseball
followers who dread the start of
‘yet another six-month season,

A the attitude copped by those who
V ' erijoyour national pastime echoes
, . thejishallow and silly sentiments

of former Mets’ second baseman/

“Saturday Night Live” character '

Chico Esquela, who‘ frequently
remarked: “Beisbol, bin berry-

. berry good, to me!”

' But for those in the know;
those who look beyond the
boxscores and post—game banter
forsolace, thestart of a new
season means the rebirth of old

' memories and the knowledge
a that new ones are only a ballgame

away.

In Bart Giamatti’s reflective
piece, Ta/ee Tz'meForParad1'5e, the
late commissioner galvanized the
meaning of perhaps the most
cherished entity baseball gives its
loyal fans — memories:

“The fullest, most expansive,
most public talk is the talk in the
lobby — baseball's second-
favorite venue. The lobby is the
park of talk; it is the enclosed
place where the game is truly
told, because it is told again and
again.

"Each time it is played and
replayed in the telling, the fabric
is refined, the nuances burnished

the color .of old silver. The
memories in baseball become
sharpest as they recede, for the
art of telling improves with age.”

With this in mind —— on the_

occasion of Opening Day 1992-

of T be Pitt News have racked their
brains conjuring up their most
memorable moments as an avid

step—father told me.”

Rob Pugliese, Senior Sports
Writer: May '26, 1990, Veterans
Stadium, Philadelphia — “It was
‘Mike Schmidt night’ at the Vet.
Anticipation had been building
for months and months (following
his retirement). You have to
realize that Schmidt was so loved
in Philly, and he was the greatest
third baseman of all—time — no
one will ever come close. He was
my favorite (player) of all—time.

“The game was sold out for

months in advance, like getting _

tickets to a U2 concert. It was
emotional because before the
game they had all the 1980
Schmidt teammates from the
World Series (winning) team there

,- Carlton, Larry Bowa, Bob Boone,

Manny T rillo, Greg Luzinski; Pete
Rose sent a message on the Phan-
a—vision. Harry Kalas, of course,
the legendary Phillies announcer,
was the emcee of the ceremony.

“So when Tug McGraw came
out-Schmidt jumped up on him to
re—create the 1980 (final out of
the World Series) scene when
Schmidt jumped in. Later, Julius
Erving came out and got a roar.
To s_ee two of the greatest legends

of America — period — together:

that was a nice feeling. It gave me
chills.”

Ryan Buncher, Senior Sports
Writer: May 50, 1986, Three
Rivers Stadium - “I went to a
Pirate game with my aunt and an

_old friend of hers. Before the

game, I find out that Johnny Ray

1 has been placed on the disabled

list. I’m like ‘oh, great! There goes
our best hitter.’ So this guy (Barry)
Bonds comes up from the minors,
he’11 start in center field and bat
third and everything else. I’d heard
the name; I knew he was Bobby

A Bonds’ son.

“I couldn’t believe that they

‘ were gonna start some rookie -—

right in Ray’s spot in the order. So
when Bonds gets up the first

time, he drills a double in the

gap. I remember watching him
sprint around the bases and seeing
his father’s smiling face on the
screen in center field. Bonds stood
on the base, dusting himself off.”
See Gallagher, page 15

Continued from page 12
did - what Rose refused to: he
dribbled into the middle of the
floor, thus negating the trapping
advantage of Cincinnati. As smart
as Voskui1’s play was, it showed
the weaknesses inherent in the
Michigan team. Duke will take
the Wolverines’ best shot, pick
itself up and go on to win.

-If you missed the women’s
Final Four game between Stanford
and Virginia (yet another example
of the best—game-in-the—semifinals

syndrome), you missed seeing '

one of the most exciting players

in college basketball: Virginia’s «

Dawn Staley. Staley, a five—foot,
six-inch point guard from
Philadelphia, is a wizard on the
floor; constantly disrupting traffic
in the paint. It’s not often that a
guard, much less a point guard,
can dominate the game. Staley is
to women’s basketball what Isiah
Thomas was to men’s-' college

hoops.

Continued from page 14

“Next thing I know, (Rick)
Honeycutt wailed around,
picks him off second base!

“‘Typical Barry Bonds. Ever
since then, he’s been doing the
same thing. He drills the ball;
you see the power, you see the
speed — but the man just
doesn’t always have his head
in the game. He’s one of the
greatest talents I’ve ever seen,
but (he’ll) just frustrates the
hell out of you! “

Brian Gallagher, Staff
Writer: Spring of 1982,
Municipal Stadium, Cleveland
— "‘It was a meaningless Tribe
game in that grimy mistake on
the lake stadium. I went with
my friend Brian and his youth
group to a Saturday game
against the KC Royals. It was
50 degrees if we were lucky,
and our group had reserved
seats behind the plate. No big
deal, right?

“So in the second inning,
Brian and I moved down to the

third base boxes, which were
empty (there were about 5,000
people there tops), to catch a
closer view of the game. Next
thing I know, Royal outfielder
Pat Sheridan, a lefty hitting
journeyman, sends a looping
foul towards me and Bri. I
jumped up from my seat,
moved about four rows back
and watched the ball bounce
off the box railing directly into
my hands! A layup nab if you
ever saw one! '

“What’s even more amazing
was what happened in the
eighth inning. After we
bragged to the rest of the
group over my prize souvenir,
me and Bri return to our box
seats in the eighth inning.
Royals’ D_HJorge Orta, another
lefty, smokes a liner our way,
and my friend Bri takes off for
it, ou_twrestling three other ball-
hungry kids for the ball. Our
line score for the day read:
one game, two friends, two
foul balls.”

Pitt unloaded on Providence
pitchers Tony DeAnge1o and Rick
Krollman for -eight runs. The
Panthers had a tremendous
offensive effort with 16 hits to
back upJunl<er’s complete game.

Game three saw the Friars jump
out to a 4-1 lead with four runs in
the bottom of the second. Those
four runs forced Pitt starter Ralph
Cecere from the game but brought
in Goettler to pitch out of a jam.
Goettler (2-1) allowed one run in
the bottom of the fourth but was
perfect from there on.

With Goettler on track, Pitt.
scored two runs in the top of the
fifth and cut the lead to 5-5. The
Panthers again struck in the sixth
to score five runs and win.

“We hit the baseball like I know
we can hit, ”Jackson saidjackson

team’s bats to come alive. He said

he is confident the team will
continue to improve with more
hitting of that caliber.

“Games two and three were
real positive,” Jackson said about
Pitt’s two convincing wins. “But
we got to keep it going. We can’t
sit down. We can’t be satisfied.

Pitt raised its record to 14-8
overall (2-4 in the Big East) and
showed it could play solid
baseball within its conference.
The Panthers had 39 hits in the
series (an average of 13 hits a
game) and only committed four
errors, defensively.

Excluding the first game, the
Panther pitching staffwas superb
in allowing 12‘hits and only 5

to take a_6-2 lead into the half.

-Those six goals would be more

than enough for Pitt, as the
Panthers, on goals by Kounas,
Stember, Leslie, Kaveny,
Gochnauer and Ed Croot, rolled
past the Streaks for an impressive
12-4 opening—game win. Pitt was
in first place after one game.

In accordance with Shootout
rules, teams are awarded one

 ,_ point for each quarter they win,
. three points for each half and five

__' -points for the game —- a total of
 15 possible points.Pitt scored a
1 perfect 15 in Game 1.

With a win under their belts,

C l  the Panthers headed toward a
 Saturday morning showdown

with Ohio State at Gesling

-A ' Stadium. Again the Panthers gave
4,. up an early goal — this time to
 the Buckeyes’ Greg Rose — to
':V trail, 1-0.

Pitt’s Gochnauer tied the game

' at 3.45 of the ﬁrst, when he

gathered his own shot and stuffed

‘the rebound past a diving OSU
4 goaltender. Kaveny gave the
 Panthers the lead for good just
' ‘ ‘three minutes later with his blast
' from about 10 yards out.

‘Gochnauer (two) and Stember
rounded out the scoring for Pitt
as they took a 5-1 lead into the
second half.

In the second half, goals by
Kounas (two), Harper Watters,
Chris Rice, Gochnauer and Leslie
capped another impressive win
for Pitt, 11-2, giving it another

perfect score of 15 points.
A 3,._ln the third and final game of

The preliminary round, Pitt moved
"back into the friendly confines of

f;}_Pitt Stadium for a rain-soaked

-contest with the Bowling Green
_{,State University Eagles.

Uncustomarily, it was the Panthers
who jumped out to the early lead
on goals from Kounas, Stember
(two) and Rice for a 4-0 lead
entering the second period.
Bowling Green cut the lead to
three on a goal by Grant Randall,
and although the lead was not to
be threatened, Pitt was in jeopardy
of losing the second quarter and
its first point of the Shootout.
Croot’s goal at 8:10 of the second
tied up the period, and Kounas’
shot just three and a half minutes
later gave the Panthers a 6-1 lead,
keeping Pitt’s perfect streak alive.
The Eagles opened the second
half with a quick goal off the
faceoff, but the Panthers’ defense
clamped down and the offense
exploded for seven more goals,
including one from defenseman
Luke Fox, who scored on an end-
to—end rush. Pitt ran away with a
13-2 victory, closing out the
preliminary round with a 3-0
recordand a perfect 45 points.
By virtue of the Shootout’s tie-
breaking procedure, Pitt was
placed in the “A” bracket as the
No. 2-seeded team. In the “A”
semifinals, the Panthers had their
hands full with a tough Fordham
squad that looked as if it was
going to send the host team
reeling from the tournament.
The Rams scored the first and
only goal of the first period, when
Bob Lawler scooped in a rolling
ball past Pitt goaltender Scott
Knowles. In the second period,
the Rams cruised to a 3-0 lead
and were threatening to blow the
game wide open until Darryl
Schmitt’s shot found its way past

Fordham’s Rob Afanasewicz to

cut the lead to two at the end of
the half.
With the ugly prospect of a

home loss staring the Panthers in
the face, the team took charge,
controlling play at both ends of
the ﬁeld. Just 1:15 into the new
half Gochnauer cut the Rams’
lead to the slimmest of margins,
and two and a half minutes later
Leslie poked home the game-
tying goal. With the game’s
momentum clearly on their side,
the Panthers got the break they
needed — this time in the form of
a Fordham penalty.

Pitt wasted no time, moving
down the ﬁeld and getting the go-
ahead goal at 6:51 from Kaveny
on the power play, putting the
Panthers ahead for good, 4-3.
Leslie single-handedly shot down
any ideas the Rams had fora
comeback with -his natural hat
trick in only two minutes during
the third period.

Fourth-period goals by
Gochnauer and Leslie ran the
final score to 10-6, giving Pitt a
shot at the championship against
the No. 1-seeded Bulls from

ASUNY-Buffalo, which earned its

trip to the ﬁnal game with a 16-1
thrashing of the defending
champions, the Pittsburgh
Lacrosse Club. .

Buffalo came into the ﬁnal game -

as the highest-scoring team in the
tournament, and the Bulls’ offense
did not slow down against Pitt.
Buffalo took advantage of the
notoriously slow—starting
Panthers, running off with four of
the game’s ﬁrst five goals en route
to a 4-1 lead, at the end of one.
Pitt’s lone goal was scored by
Kaveny, who intercepted a
clearing pass from the Buffalo
goaltender and lobbed the ball
from the mid—line into the empty
net.

lead to 6-1 on goals by Peter
Tinnesz and John MacBlane, it
appeared as if they would be
returning to upstate New York
with this year’s Shootout title.
But two goals by Leslie and
another by Kounas in the half’s
final minutes cut the lead to 6-4
and, if anything, let Buffalo know
it was not going to win without a

‘ﬁght

Play opened up in the second
half with the two defenses
dictating the game’s ,back-and-
forth pace. Five minutes went by
in the third before Pitt found
itself in a man-u p situation, thanks
to an offsides penalty against
Buffalo. Midﬁelder Chris Rice
took a pass from Leslie and
bounced home a power-play
goal, cutting the margin to one
goal. Buffalo, however, came
back, increasing the score to 7-5
with only a minute left in‘ the
quarter on a controversial goal
that appeared to hit the post and
stay in front of the goal line
behind Pitt’s Knowles.

Twice in the fourth period Pitt
cut the Bulls’ lead to one, but
both times Buffalo returned the
favor —— the last one coming at
10:50, putting them on top, 9-7,
with only four minutes remaining
in regulation.

With 2:30 left in the game,
Croot fed Gochnauer a pass that
the second-year midfielder
deposited into the net, cutting
the lead to 9-8 and setting up the
dramatic ﬁnal minutes.

Needing» a goal to force
overtime, the Panthers began

' pressing for possession but lost

the ball to a Buffalo player, who
immediately charged up the field

toward the Panthers’ cage. Pitt‘

ﬁnally recovered possession with

about a minute left to set up one
last rush.

With the game on the line, the
Panthers’ offense came out
charging, determined not to go
down in its own tournament.
Shot after shot was denied by
Buffalo goaltender Kevin Smith.
When Pitt missed on a pass,
throwing the ball out of bounds
with only 25 seconds remaining,
it looked as if Pitt was going to
come up one goal short. But fate
had something better in store for
the Panthers.

Only 10 seconds remained
when Buffalo, with championship
in hand, attempted a clearing
pass. Croot was Pitt’s man on the
spot as he picked it off and
miraculously found Gochnauer
in front of the Buffalo net all

. alone for the tying goal, sending

the Pitt sideline into a frenzy and

J the game into overtime.

— Buffalo opened the extra period
with possession but quickly lost
the ball when defenseman Jeff
John alertly picked off a Bulls
pass and raced down the ﬁeld
with the ball. Possession switched
hands twice again, leaving Pitt
with the ball with about 1:30 left
in overtime and setting up
Stember’s heroics.

“I could not have written a
better script to this game,” head
coach Gary Neft said.”

Throughout the year the offense
has garnered most of the attention,
but throughout the tournament
Neft expounded upon the team’s
defense, backed by Tim Kenkel,
Pat Condo, Chris Baily, Fox and

"John. R’ ‘C ’ '

“There is no better defense in
the world,” Neftsaid. “We played
as a team, and whenkjgwe do that
we can beat anybody.”

Royals looks like Dan Stryzinski’s
replacement as the team’s punter.
Robert Drummond could make
the team as a reserve if Tim
\X/orley'is suspended for the
season as expected for missing
two drug tests.

The other signees are probably
just bodies for training camp.
Smagala could stick if there are
enough injuries at safety. Oh yeah,
the Steelers did sign a wide
receiver, Darrin Chandler, who
has been out of the league since
being on the Chiefs’ practice
squad in 1989. Doesn’tshe just
inspire hope in the hearts of all

didn’t think so.

This whole thing is disturbing
for many reasons. For one thing,
Plan B free agency is not working
as it was supposed to. It was not
just meant to let players on the
edge of the bench move to a
team for which they might play
more, it was also meant to -keep
the best teams from stockpiling
talent. Still, it has been the top
teams in the league that have
prospered.

In addition to past moves such
as James Lofton to Buffalo and
Ronnie Lott to the Raiders, many
of the top players available this
time around went to top teams.
In addition to the Oilers getting
Gray, Dave Krieg went to the
Kansas City Chiefs, and Drew
I-Iill went to the Atlanta Falcons.
Hill would have been a great

acquisition for the Steelers, but
he was probably out of their
price range.

The Steelers did take on one of
the NFL elite for one player as
they competed with San Francisco
for the services of safety Thane
Gash, but it was the 49ers who
got their man. '

Another problem I have with
this season's Plan-B signings is
the Steelers’ continuing resistance

The competition is designed to honor excellence in course
work of students at the University of Pittsburgh. A first prize of

reserve outside linebacker," not

what you want from a number»

one draft choice. —

The Steelers either have to -
adjust to their personnel or make .
changes. Maybe use the surplus .
at safety and outside linebacker .
to trade for a quarterback or help

for the offensive line. Even more

important will be the use of the. *
. top pick. Noll showed an aversion

to players whose attitudes he
didn’t like.
For the Steelers, it is time to get

‘ down to the business of using_all

avenues available to builda better
team.

For the NFL, it is time to get rid
of a Plan-B system that is’ not
working. A move to total free
agency might be the answer, but
a salary cap is a necessity to avoid

the spiraling salaries currently ’ 

threatening the financial stability
of baseball. The players would

surely agree to a cap if they were

to get free agency and probably
the continuing existence of the
draft. .

There you have it, a sports
column. Nothing earth shattering
but nothing that turns off readers
either. just some stuff for the
sports junkies with a -little
acknowledgement for some
disgruntled readers that have bee
