0 Pope John Paull Dies in Sleep of Heart Altclcki

By -The Associated Press

ROME — ‘Pope John Paul I died of a heart attack
in his sleep during the night, the Vatican announced.
He was 65 and had been elected just last month.

The Vatican said the pontiff died about 11 p.m.
Thursday and his death was discovered when his
household staff came to wake him about 5:30 a.m.
Friday morning.

During his brief reign, the pontiff had already
transformed the normally sedate papal audiences in-
to informal gatherings, peppered with personal anec-
dotes and broken up with laughter from guests.

- Just two days. ago, presiding over the weekly
Vatican general audience, he called up a 5th grade
student and interviewed him in front of the 10,000
persons packing the hall.

“Do you always want to be in the 5th grade?” he
askedthe boy. i ‘

“Yes,” the youth replied.
change teachers. ”. I

“Well, you are different from the pope,” the pon-
tiff remarked. “When I was in 4th grade, I worried
about making to the 5th and when in the 5th,‘ ‘about
passing to the 6th.” . A  ,

Such anecdotes had emerged as trademarks of
John Paul, endearing him to the public.

By contrast, his predecessor,_ Paul VI,was known
for his formal and intellectual approach to his

general audiences, resorting to’ humor only on rare _

product of one of the thousands of villages that dot
the Italian countryside. ' —

“I am a little man accustomed to little things and
to silence,” he said before his election.

He had spent most of his  in ”t=?"‘y’s northeast
where he was born in the Alpine alley village of
Forno di Canale. His father, a socialist, was for
many years a migrant" worker in Switzerland. His
mother was a peasant, “strong and devout,” as he
once said. .

He entered the seminary at ‘a young age and during
summer vacations returned home _to work in the
fields.

Many in his home village remember seeing him cut-
ting the grass wearing the black‘ cassock that
seminarians then wore.

His favorite subjects as a student were philosophy,
theology and literature. I I

He was ordained a priest on July 7, 1935 and
graduated from Rome’s Gregorian University. After
graduation he went back to his native village to work
in the local parish,‘ then to a nearby town where he
also taught religion in a vocational school.

For the next 10 years he was deputy director in the
Belluno Seminary. In 1948, Luciani became ‘one of
the top aides of the bishop of Belluno and was put in
charge of teaching religion. . » " .

He concentrated on making his teaching as simple
as possible so that illiterate mountain people could
understand it. He. recounted his experiences in.a

A Ehrlichman Defends His CoIIege_Leclure Tour  

By MICHELLE WEDDINGTON

John Ehrlichman, former Nixon
aide convicted of conspiracy and
obstruction of justice, defended his
current college lecture tour to ‘a
large crowd at David Lawrence Hall
last night. '

“I feel awkward about doing this
kind of thing for money,”
Ehrlichman said. ‘‘I’d be satisﬁed
if I ﬁll. in some gaps that are
valuable to you. If you think it’s a
rip-off, let me know—I won’t do it

~ any more.”

Ehrlichman’s half hour speech
and one hour question-and—answer
session concerned the presidential
election process. He expressed the
need to be taken seriously by the
national media. ’

“The people want a guy who’s

an all-around family man who

breaks ﬁshing dates with his kids to
go shake hands with locals in order
to gain points from delegates,”

« Ehrlichman said.

Ehrlichman felt that was why
George McGovern lost the 1972
presidential election. ' .

“The people tend to shy awa
from emotion,” he said. “We
cannot have a man who’s going to
cry over the harrassment of his wife
——he must not be emotional,
fallible, drab, vacillate or be a
loser, foriif he is,‘ he is destined to
fall by the wayside.”

The question-and—answer ses-
sion evaded the original .issue.
Students were mainly concerned
with the Watergate scandal; When

asked how he justiﬁed his rolein
V the scandal and why, he replied, “I

thought I was doing the right
, thing. . .understanding _my- job . ’ ’

Ehrlichman believed Nixon
should have admitted his mistake
earlier. “I can’t pinpoint in days
and hours the number of opportun-
ities forhim to step out completely
in total disclosure,”,he said. “He
could have ‘saved himself.”

Ehrlichman felt ex-President
Gerald Ford did what was right in
pardoning Nixon.

“If he didn’t, the White House
would have been torn apart. All
business matters would have’ been

at a standstill while all tapes,

papers and documents were being
investigated,” he said.

“It was a tough decision——he
paid the price by not being

. re-elected. ’ ’

Despite ‘ his, conviction, Ehrlich-
man was not worried about his bad
reputation. “I quit worrying about
my so-called image,” he said. _“I

decided to be true to. myself. "’

Federal Judge Allows
  Abortions To Continue

By the Associated Press

PHILADELPI-IIA—The state of
Pennsylvania was ordered by a
federal judge yesterday to continue
payments for abortions -under
Medicaid for the next 10 days.

U:S. District Judge Louis
Bechtle, in granting a temporary
restraining order, scheduled an
Oct. 5 hearing on whether to issue
a preliminary injunction. ' I I

He also promised to “make
every effort to have a ﬁnal ruling on
this matter before Oct. 20.”

Bechtle’s order halted imple-
mentation of a new law, passed by
the Legislature this week over the

“veto of Gov. Milton Shapp. The
_measure would allow Medicaid
payments for abortions only to save
the life of a mother. V

A new federal law already bans

. certain Medicaid abortions, but it is
not as strict as Pennsylvania’s law.

Bechtle’s action was in response
to a request for a temporary

restraining order made by lawyers
for four community groups-
Women’s Law Project, Planned
Parenthood, Community Legal
Services and the American Civil
Liberties Union.

The judge's 10-day order re-
strains state Treasurer Robert
Casey from refusing‘ to reimburse
clinics or doctors performing the
abortions, and state Welfare
Secretary Aldo Colautti from
putting into effect the new state
regulations.

.Stanley Slipakoff, an assistant
attorney general representing the
Welfare Department, had told the
judge at a hearing that neither the
Welfare Department nor the
attorney general has taken , a
position on the validity of the new
law, and that by the time the judge
hears arguments and is ready to
make a decision the attorney
general might have a ruling.

Sporting a full beard, John
D. Ehrilchman explained why
he was touring colleges. “For
the money,” he said._
also doing them because I have

some things lthink will be

interesting to say. It’s one of
the easiest ways I know to pick
up several thousand dollars for
a day's work.”

Ehrlichman, an aide to
former President Nixon, spoke
brieﬂy to newsmen yesterday
afternoon at the Student Union

.Lower Lounge, prior to ‘his
‘scheduled engagement at
‘David Lawrence.

In answer to his topic, “Why

‘ We Choose the Presidents We

Do,” Ehrlichman said» the
process has changed in the past
20 years.

He said he believes so much
of the campaigning today is
done in ‘‘symbols,'’ :1 sort of
packaging of a candidate to
obscure what the man really is
like. Ehrlichman said people

‘often are surprised when a

‘Slim’

candidate actually sits down at
the desk and faces daily
problems.

Is there a difference between
presidential advisers of now
and then? Ehrlichman believes
there is, since “every president
is different. His staff is like a
suit of clothes. It’s cut- to ﬁt
him.” ,

When asked about welfare
reform, Ehrlichman readily
admitted it badly was needed,
and overdue. He added that he
didn't thinkit was possible to
get with this Congress. A

In regard to’ students object-
ing to Ehrlichman’s engage-
ment at Pitt, he replied, “I
hope I can make it worthwhile
for those who come. I”m,
serious about it, and feel I have
some contributions due to the
fact I held that domestic policy
job longer than anyone else.
I've had a lot to’ do with
presidential campaigns, and
I’d like to make a little clearer
the sense of what went on in
those murky days.”

PMAP, Health ServiceiRepresentatives Meet

By SUE MCFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The fate of the student-run Peer
Medical Aid Program and the
Student Health Advisory Board will
be decided today when members of
both groups meet with Student
Health Service representatives and
Student Government board mem-
ber Dave Hesidence to discuss the
merger of PMAP with Student
Health Service and the restructur-
ing of SHAB.

The Peer Medical Aid Program
offers emergency first aid treatment
and peer medical counseling. Until
last April it was an arm of the
now-disbanded Student Govern-
ment Medical Action Committee.
According to Hesidence the Med-

ical Action Committee was dissolv-
ed because it duplicated the
services of the Student Health
Service.

A merger of PMAP with the
service would cause all ﬁnancial
responsibility for the student
program to be assumed by the
Student Health Service via the
student health fee. Health service
staff members would take over the
supervisory positions, assisting the
trained student volunteers in their
work. -.

“PMAP is a vital service that we
can’t afford to lose,” Hesidence
said earlier." “The services
provided by PMAP can create some
touchy situations that an'under
graduate regardless of his training

might not be able to handle. as well"
as someone trained in the field.”
The Student Health Advisory
Board consists of volunteers
representing undergraduate, grad-'
uate and professional programs
within the University. The board’s
primary purpose is to oversee the
workings of the Student Health
Service andthe use of the student

. health fee.

' At a meeting earlier this week
among Hesidence, Joe Roberts,
chairman of the Student Health
Advisory Board and health educator
Bob LaCivita, two proposals were
submitted.

S Both proposals were identical in

that they both‘ asked for the.

transferral of PMAP to the student

Health Service. However, it was the
second point of each proposal that
put the stopper on passage of either
plan. This second point called for
the restructuring of the Student
Health Advisory Board in two

different ways.

Hesidence asked that a plan be
implemented whereby the Student
GovernmentBoard and the Grad-
uate and Professional Student
Association would each_ appoint
three members to the board. The
School of General Studies Cabinet,
because of their limited particip-
ation in the Student Health Service,
would be permitted to appoint one
non-voting member to the board.

Hesidencestated earlier that the

monitoring of the Student"‘-'I9.Ie?2/1l.‘l_'i:l:1\‘_

Service by the SHAB.would ;i,1»1,i'-‘_no,.
’ way be affectedqby the-change‘._:. ,_ ,

‘Roberts, ‘Robinson and LaCiv.i_ta’ 
calls for the creation -of a :»;;¢w"r:-:2?

Several student organiza-
, tions banded together this
 week and conducted a mass

4 T  voter registration drive in an

effort to increase the number of
. voters at Pitt; ‘T
‘ Booths were set up in the
i Towers Lobby, Cathedral
_1 Commons Room and the
Student Union Wednesday
7 through today. ’ Registration
cards were distributed. C"
-Salina Robinson of the Black
A Action Society initiated the

 the.College Young Democrats,

I ‘?’*-‘College Young Republicans,

A Inter-fratemity Council, Pan-
' hellenic Association and the
f Public‘ and Governmental Rela-
 tions Committee of Student
‘ Government.

“There have never been so
many organizations involved

9

with the registration drive,’
said Nello Giorgetti, president
of the CYD. “We hope that
with better organization, there ~
will be more of a turnout.”

The purpose of the drive is to
give the students of Pitt more
of‘a voice in their government,
Giorgetti said.

\ “Students aren’t a real
political force,” said Tim
Kearny, PGR public relations
director. “The legislators
realize this and consequently
they aren’t concerned about
the students’ needs.”

Thousands of leaﬂets des-
cribing the locations and hours
of the registration tables were
distributed before Saturday's
Pitt-Temple game.

By mid-aftemoon on Thurs-
day, approximately. 150 stu-

dents had registered to vote for '

this November's election. i
Although predictions on the

nesday through Friday.

ﬁnal turnout were difﬁcult to
make, organizers of the drive
termed it a moderate success.

  Allocations
and WPGH

V »A. statistical breakdown of Student Government
.Board’s allocations to various student organizations
‘appeared in Wednesday’s Pitt News. The Board’s

. < decisions on who got how big a slice of the $248,000

,in undergraduate activity fees lead us to make a few

' ‘observations.

There is much to be said for the diversity of the
fforganizations chosen to benefit from the SGB’s

1%-largesse. Pitt students may, for another year, score
V flwith the Hockey Club, learn to kick in slow motion .

I E with the Kung‘Fu Club, get high on_Angel’Flight and
I  come out of the closet with Gay Supporters at Pi_tt.

Not all the organizations and figures on the SGB’s

r ,list 'are‘ "so easily and uncritically lampooned,

iihogwever. What, we. wonder, will the Pitt Union’

“{iProgramming Council do with what is now left of its

$14,360 allotment for lectures? Further subsidize

A . Junrepentent felons?

Most disturbing are the present difficulties

surrounding the grantingof additional funds to the ,
~. campus radio station, WPGH. The Board has

“already given WPGH $5,000, but another $5,000 or

so is needed to replace equipment that is in bad con-
dition. Without the money, WPGH has said it will
have to shut down. '

Unlike many of the other organizations funded by
the Board, WPGH serves a wide range of the student
population. As a result, it should-—and, for the most
part, does—-receive priority when it comes to
allocating activity fee money. Unfortunately,
because two student organizations have been fiscally
irresponsible or inept, and because the SGB and the
Allocations Committee periodically’ find it necessary
to compete’ with one another rather than cooperate,

WPGH is now having trouble getting the money it «

needs.

' “Last week, WPGH-was told that it would receive
$5,100 from the SGB, out of the Board’s own
operating budget. This week, it was revealed thatlast
year’s Owl and the Franklin Pangborn Societyﬂhad
overspent-their budgets by a total of $7,500. The

A Allocations Committee recommended that the Board.
' use the money earmarked for'WPGH to cover some

of the deficit instead. The Board refused and tabled
the question of further funding for the radio station.
' Behind at least some of this is an uncooperative

spirit that tends to sour relations between the SGB ' 

and the Allocations Committee. The Board
sometimes seems to want to act unilaterally, without
outside inﬂuence or _interference; the Allocations

Page .6—Friday, September 29, 1978

Committee tends to forget it is strictly an advisory
organization. ’

The two groups now need to get together and
figure a way to get WPGH the money it needs, while
still covering the deficit. It is hard to believe that
overspending by last year’s yearbook and film club is
just now coming to light——what marvelous
bookkeeping—but that is not the most immediate

problem. Blame can be assigned and appropriate ac- - .

tion taken later. The most. immediate problems are
to cover debts now due and to get WPGH the money
it needs. Students should not be deprived of one of
the best services available to them.

‘Third Generation of

resemblance to j.‘ “Proﬁles , in Cour-a

,  By_ PATTYTASCARELLA

 -The -third ‘- generation of the’
Kennedy dynastyalready is emerg-

 ing‘, even-as‘Sen. Edward Kennedy
" is challenging Jimmy Carter in the

popula-rity polls. ‘Robert F.
Kennedy, Jr. came -forth ‘this
summer .as .3 heir apparent to a
resurrected Camelot.

At a‘ press conference this

‘summer to publicize his ﬁrst book,

“Judge Frank, M. Johnson,”

,—Kennedy Jr. told reporters he felt

V gthe book would mark his emer-

’ rgence as “an active Kennedy.” He

' {added that he intends to specialize

?'in ‘public service, though

-‘necessarily limiting myself to
7,'politics.” ‘

It

not

‘S ~Kennedy’s emergence ties in
=neatly with the publication of

:Arthur M. Sehlessinger’s long-

awaited chronicle of his father.
“Robert F. Kennedy: His Life and

Times” hails the late New York ‘

senator as the man who would be‘

i king in 1968, or, as Esquire dubbed

-‘him—“'I'he Lost President." As
Schlessinger recounts it, Kennedy
could have and would have saved
America from the hysterical unrest
that typiﬁed 1968, and it naturally
follows that the war would have
ended by Christmas and Watergate

goes, and legends are made by

assassination. RFK is a near deity, .

as much a ﬁgure of wistful
remembrence and lost hope as
John F. Kennedy himself.

So the legacy.seemingly is being
passed on ' to. Robert Kennedy

_Jr.—-‘+RFK II; . Blessed with» blood

ties‘- to two revered; ﬁgures _of

’ glamourized idealism, Kennedy Jr.

need not even both_er draw
comparisons—the name Kennedy
sufﬁces. » . »_
Curiously, though, it -is not his
father but Uncle; Jackfthat Robert
Jr. is emulating'."-'- The book,

“Judge Frank M..Johnson,”~ grew,

out of Kennedy’s senior- thesis’ at
Harvard, as did JFK’s opus, “Why
England Slept.” And in the
background echoes oldr Joe
Kennedy's maxim that voters
remember a good book.

“Judge Frank M. Johnson” is a‘
book that’ pays homage to the
Kennedy heritage in two ways. It
is an examination of Alabama
politics. The interactions of the
Wallaces and Folsoms bear a
strong, though southern-fried,
resemblance to the - Curleys,
Fitzgeralds and, later, Kennedys of
Boston in the early part of the.
century. ,

More importantly, “Judge Frank

age”——JFK’s_ Pulitzer Prize-
winning biography of 1956. V
Until the release of his book,
Robert Jr’.'rarel-y ‘surfaced and the
three times he did in the years after
his father’s assassination were not

the best, sort, of. publicity .for an ~

. . . .'.7.~5 .
aspiring ,pol1t1c1an. . He was
arrested" for possession of mari-

juana, for speeding and for spitting V

ice cream in the face of an ofﬁcer

who warned him to stoploitering,
All the while, the spotlight and -
expectations. were focused on his:

brother, Jos_‘eph_“,P,.‘ Kennedy III,’

until. a girl’ was paralyzed as a .
result of an auto accident while she .
Vwas~ra”passenge'r“jin ’Joe’s car.  '

“I should bef‘ablet_o transcend"-
the unfortunate publicity,” Roberts’
‘Junior has persisted,'. and___ he's
right. After all, his father was able’

to transcend his reputation as Joe

V .McCarthy’s righthand man during
the witch hunts of the 1950s and '

Uncle Ted, still dampened from

Chappaquiddick, is probably the »

most popular Democratic leader in
the country. i V - .

’ Is it true that a Kennedy" is
simply born to politics, that it exists
in his very genes—or is it simply
the name and’ the legacy that
ensures his success’ in political

‘never would have happened. So it M. Johnson” bears a strong circles?

S the Kennedy, Dynasty   

‘A As Robert Kennedy’ Jr. starts his
legal training this fall at‘ the
University of Virginia School of
Law (the alma mater of RFK), as he

steadfastlydeclares himself to be a -
resident of the state of New York.

(he was raised in Virginia) and does

not discourage rumors that he’s_
eyeing a congressional seat there,

as he runs the gauntlet of the talk
showcircuit, it’s not premature to
assume ‘that yet‘. another Kennedy
is going irito the family business.

And no matter what becomes of
the assumed presidential aspira-
tions of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,_

‘be assoiéiatedrwith ’ politics.

Problems,at ithe Mediccrzi School

Your '°rece_nt analysis “of: Dr.

»Werner’s vrresignatiionfr: pointed to »
 ﬁnancial’ pfroblems as the cause of

his relinguishiing deanship; or the
School of rMedicine ' and "implied

‘ that the ﬁnancial crisis'jwas caused,

in‘ part,‘ by excessive spending on
minority students{- * ‘A V

A ‘Truje,:tlie School of Medicine is
in serious ﬁnancial "trouble. But,

contrary to 'Dr.IPosvar’s assertion ,

that ‘-‘we have a great medical
school,” it is the view of many that

. Pitt was a great medical school ﬁve S

or 10 years ago. However, lack of

effective and concemed- leadership _

from the Cathedral and the
carpeted floors" of Sc_aife Hall are
the real reasons why our medical
school now ﬁnds ' ‘itself nearly
paralyzed and intellectually bank-
rupt.

To suggest that the terrible state
of affairs in the School of Medicine
is due to excessive spending, on
minority students is incorrect at the
least, and at worst, damaging to a
segment of the Western Pennsyl-

vania community that never has ,

been effectively served by the
University of Pittsburgh. -

Such myths do great harm. I
assure youthe three black medical
students who entered Pitt this
September are not the folks who
are destroying academic, excellence
in the School of Medicine. '

The burden they place on the
school of medicine pales into
insignificance, when compared
with the $30,000 to $60,000 salaries
that are wasted, without concern,
on incompetent faculty members
and administrators who are incap-

, able of teaching, investigating or

administering. .

Finally, the leaders of ﬁrst-rate
institutions of higher learning

realize that constant and intensive

[attention isneeded to achieve and

maintain academic excellence . Our
chancellor should reflect. on
whether the time he has devoted to
cheerleading with the Golden
Panthers could have been better
spent in more worthwhile activi-
ties.  i '

_We wish to commend the
Anti-lmperialist Student Union and
the Student Government Board for
their resolution, asking the Univers-
ity to divest its holdings in
companies doing business with
South Africa. We also appreciate
your editorial on the subject. '

However, the SGB resolution .

does not have to be merely a

symbolic gesture. As your editorial 

mentioned, the divestment move-
ment is nationwide in scope.
Recently, the University of Massa-
chusetts, Hampshire College, and
the Oregon Board of Higher
Education have agreed to sell their
interests in companies that do
business with the apartheid regime.
Naturally, they did not sell these
extremely proﬁtable holdings out of

the goodness of their hearts.

Widespread pressure from students
and other groups was able to
overcome their resistance. This is
the strategy that students here at
Pitt must follow if opposition to
University holdings in South Africa
is to be-more than symbolic.

 """I'he ﬁlm stars George Segal and

 culinary spectrum, with veteran
 ‘British actor Robert Morley thrown
a , in between them.

 Bisset is Natasha O'Brien, the

and fast talking Robby Ross, a fast

The action shifts from London to.

Venice where Stefano Satta Floresi
as the world's greatest lobster chef
Fautio Zoppi, is drowned in his
aquarium. ’

In Brussels, the ﬁnal victim,
Moulineau (Phillipe Noiret), the
chef who supplies the main course,
stuffed duck, has his head
squashed—by a duck press. *

The murder scenes may sound
gory, but the interactions between
beautiful Bisset and the buffooning
Segal keep the ﬁlm as light and airy
as a souffle. ' - A ‘

Bisset is captivatingas ‘she tries
to outwit the killer and keep herself

desserts will make her the next
victim. ' *

The dialogue is witty as Morley,
totally despising the clowning
Segal, attempts to ’play the
sympathetic father ﬁgure to Bisset.

Segal’s behavior throughout the
ﬁlm is typiﬁed by a scene from the
ﬁlm’s opening moments when he
scares out the owners of a
vegetarian restaurant, by telling
them he is opening’ a roast beef
joint‘ next door featuring cattle
slaughtered on the premises for
“that genuine Texas freshness.”

The ﬁlm’s ending is a triﬂe weak
because the murderer is rather.
easy to deduce due to the limited
number of characters. But on the
whole, the ﬁlm is merely Segal and

glorious European countryside.
The plot of “Who’s Killing the
Great Chefs‘ of Europe” is
reminiscent of one of Doris Day’s
patented romantic comedies from
the 19605. t . '

Bisset’_s beauty and’ elegant
grace are nicely matched by

.Segal’s hokey downhome routing

and Morley’s dry and droll British
wit—-the three are fun to watch.
Key contributors to the ﬁlm’s
stunning appearance is one of
France’s most brilliant chefs, Paul
Bocuse, for his especially created
dishes in the ﬁlm which are not
only lavish in their presentation,
but also look decadently delicious.
Henry Mancini’s musical score,
though hardly memorable, serves

alive when she realizes her

By SIDNEY ROOT and LISA KAMP

Having exposed ourselves to nearly every existing
breed of music except the so-called New Wave, we
were torn" between a sense of journalistic challenge
and mild trepidation during the apps:-;.;?:5u z—; of
Cleveland’s entry into the punk ﬁeld-—the Dead
Boys—at Swissvale’s Phase 3 Lounge Tuesday. We
were not to be disappointed, as droves of area punks .
turned out to witness the Dead Boys’ thundering
onslaught of noise and visual bizarreness. ‘

The audience was nearly as decadent as the show,
and in some cases much more; interesting: from a
profusion of leather, leopard skin, c/hains, makeup
and razor haircuts to am] nitrate, spilled and broken’
beer bottles and forms of dance ranging from sexual
innuendo to martial arts. One fan, decked out in a
1940’s leopard-print dress, spike-heeled leather
boots, an overabundance of glittered makeup and
teased hair, approached us and asked if she'd seen us

_ ﬁat punk affairs before. When we denied it, she,wrote
,us off by adding that after awhile all us folks with long

hair look alike. , .

They all had come to hear a driving explosion of
physically and mentally taxing sound, which the Dead,
Boys present under the guise of music. Ironically, the
ﬁve-lman group does not consider itself true punks in
the British sense of the word.

“There were times when I did,‘_‘ admits thythm
guitarist Jimmy Zero, ‘ ‘but that's because I identiﬁed
with a certain few bands that represented it. I don’t
believe in the whole movement. It’s not real. “Print
this in italics.-‘ ‘ He adds, ‘ ‘My whole advice to people
who like the Dead Boys is, don’t follow the Dead Boys.
No one can tell you what to do, not the Dead Boys or
anyone else but yourself. All we're trying to tell
people isthat they can do whatever they want to do to
be happy and get away with it. We don’t want to solve
the world's problems: we don’t care. We’re not
offering any solutions. We’re just telling them to ﬁnd
their.own way—follow your hearts and follow your

_heads. ’ ’
The performance, for lack of a better word, centered

around the visual rather than the musical. While our
sense of hearing was immediately dulled and later
tortured, the boys brought grim attention to their own
physical outrageousness. The emphasis was on lead
singer Stiv Bators, who, while admittedly not a
vocalist or even a musician, delighted in hurling
himself around the stage, recklessly screaming his
own vague lytrics while crashing various parts of
himself into equipment, other band members, fans
and even the stage itself.

After the show, during which Bators smashed
several large stage mirrors with a microphone, he
asked us why the crowd hadn’t gone insane. “They
should’ve tore the place up,”he complained.

Perhaps the least surprising fact is that only Johnny .

Blitz, the scar-covered drummer known as the band's
“pin.cushion,” has had any sort of musical training.
Along with the more reserved bassist, Jeff Magnum,
Blitz forms a rhythm section-closer to real music than
any the Dead Boys ever have produced-

The ‘strongest punk element in this band is the
violent interaction of Stiv Bators and lead guitarist
Cheetah Chrome, who appears half nude in leopard
tights and razor-cut red hair, and has been wearing
his dog collar since the early ’70s. While it was hard

Bisset rampaging throughout the

for Deadhoys' Punk Rock

light comedic approach .

to make sense of any of his undeniably energetic
playing, Cheetah neatly insured and encore with his
only spoken words of the evening: “You want any.

' more, you gotta scream for it...we’re all deaf
anyway.” _ I J -

V The idea seems to be the total destruction of the
status quo. If this is really the Dead Boys’ goal, the
group is doing very well indeed. Forsaking even the
all-important sound check, it has abandoned all

‘ regard for technical and aesthetic command of its

I“_music,” _retaining only the instrments, which are
nearly worthless in the context. of ' their
ear-splitting, atonal set. '

Jimmy Zero told us he could say more with an E# A#
and D chord than, for example, Rithchie Blackmore (of
Deep Purple) ever will say in his life. Certainly he is
stretching the point, of lack thereof, just a little.

The Dead Boys have lived up to the title of their first ‘ I

LP album, “Young, Loud and Snotty,”. and then
some. The follow-up album, “We Have Come For
' Your Children, ” bodes more ill than anything else for
lovers of real rock an roll music.
Although they insist on calling it rock and roll rather

than genuine “punk,” they nevertheless proudly L

display a vast ‘array of scars, cuts, bruises and
cigarette burns as mementos of their road tours.
Forgive us if you must, but these are not the familiar

trappings of the beloved rock on which we were

raised. Where are the harmonies,strident of
otherwise? Where are the magical, riveting
instrumental adventures that make rock what it is? A
rhythm section should sound rhythmic, but not like
this.

As badly wanting for a concrete “statement” as the '

Dead Boys are, their scars may indeed be the best they
have to offer. As our ears slowly return to normal, we
must conclude that with all due respect to the Dead
Boys brand of music, theiname ﬁts perfectly.

Johnny Blitz and fellow Daadboys say
they don’t like their band to be iden-
tified with the new wave or punk rock
movements.

  Pirates Prepare for the Weekend Showdown with Phillies

By The Associated Press

The Pittsburgh Pirates took
yesterday’ off-—but Dave Parker
continued to hack away.

“I’ve got to cut wood, split logs,
get my ﬁrewood ready for winter,”
said Parker, staying loose for this
weekend’s four-game showdown
with the Philadelphia—Phillies.

At his home,team.captain Willie

Stargell remained in the cleanup
spot after hosting a team party the
night before.

“I’ve got some‘ work to do
around the house, things you don’t
have much time for with our busy
schedule,” said Stargell, setting a
steady tone for a Pirate team that
must win all four games from the
Phils at Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers

Stadium to stay alive in baseball
National League East. '

If they do sweep, the Pirates will
go to Cincinnati for a makeup game.
Win that game, and the Pirates take
the division. Lose it and-they must
meet the Phils in a one-game
playoff.

Freddie Jacobs Becomesa

By JERRY NEMETH

Fast Freddie Jacobs, the veteran
among Pitt’s trio of starting
running backs, seems to be making
the most of his experience.

In last Saturday’s game against
Temple, Jacobs scored one of the
Panthers two third-quarter touch-
downs on a 23-yard scamper. ‘ Tak-
ing ,a pitchout and running to his
left, ,Jacobs cut behind what he
describes as “a ..good block‘ by
Rooster (Jones), and the lane was
there.” -'

“I went in untouched,” said

-Jacobs.

In addition to being a smart
runner and a dependable pass
receiver, Jacobs has been exhibit-
ing some ferocious blocking of late.

Head coach Jackie Sherrill
attributes Jacobs’ recent blocking

, success to some few added pounds

and Jacobs’ work on his blocking
techniques. A Sherrill added that
Jacobs has helped teammates
Larry Sims and Jones with many
aspects of their games as well.

‘ ‘tough-

usually ‘uses phrases
“complete back” and

runner” as synonyms for Jacobs. .

The junior running back allows

himself the luxury of pursuing one H.

a sophomore, Jacobs rushed for
672 yards. for an offense whose
major weapon hung from quarter-
back Matt Cavanaugh’s right
shoulder. With the Pitt passing

‘attack temporarily grounded,

Jacobs may get a shot to grant his
own wish.
Jacobs prefers to take a low-key

approach to the prospect of a
professional football career and has
adopted an “if it happens, it

happens” outlook on the subject.

  Anemic A ttendance at Stadium To Cost.Pirates Big Bue(k)s 

Pittsburgh’s Pirates, the hottest team in baseball,
have been struggling through a terrible slump. Not
with their bats. At the turnstiles. _, i

The anemic gatherings at Three Rivers Stadium
this year, though disheartening, were at least under;
standable earlier in the season. Up until Aug. 12 the
Bucs were playing mediocre baseball and reeling as
far as 11'/2 games behind the division-leading
Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East.

The Pirates won 34 of their next 45 games,‘
however, and suddenly were giving the Phils arun

.for the championship money. Entering tonight's
season-ending series with Philadelphia at \Three
Rivers, the Buccos have an outside chance of winning
it all. P ~

Still, only crowds that would half fill the Civic
Arena seem interested in the pennant race. j

Area fans staying away from Three Rivers Stadium
as if it were quarantined is not a problem of recent
origin.‘ Last year, when major league baseball was
setting attendance records, the Pirates outdrew only
two other teams. They attracted 1.2 million and lost
money. ' '

This year, with three home dates remaining, the?
club is roughly 350,000 behind last season’s dubious
pace and, in all probability, will not break a million
at the gate.

There is reason to believe the root of the situation

digs deeper than any problems the club may have ex-v

V perienced during the last two years. only.“ According

  Timeout

By JIM PA NE

to a survey by a suburban newspaper this summer,
front office blunders have played a major part in the

. area’s baseball apathy. Those blunders originated

within former general manager Joe _L. Brown"s
organization and continued into Harding Peterson’s,
the survey reveals. . .

' It cites various reasons for the nonsupport. Among
them are: thefiring of Bob Prince, thriftless trades,
over-paid players, under-paid players, “fdreigners”

ion the roster (“What happened to the American

white boys?”), the stadium’s inaccessibility’ and high
concession prices. One reply even mentions a con-
tempt _for stadium rest rooms.

A good number of those responses, however, ad-
dress the team’s racial standing. One reply, from “a
former Pirate fan," suggests the Pirates change their
name to the Black Pirates. “Maybe that way they will

be able to fill the stadium with blacks,’? it S3§YS-

“Blacks do not patronize the Pirates,” another
agrees. “(There are) more blacks on the ﬁeld than in
the stands.”- . . '

_While_ some of the gripes "gathered through the_ sur-p 

vey are more valid than others, ‘they all are aimed at

the front office. Deservedly so. Publicity, though,’

has been the major deficiency within the Pirate:
organization, which has discovered the hard way that
people rarely ﬂock to the stadium merely because th’
gates are open. ' »
Publicity gimmicks '(good ones,» -like ‘babushka
power and’ the green weenie, not a banal wrist band
gi_veaway‘day) have worked for the team in the past;
it’s to the Pirates’ disadvantage they have abandoned
them.‘ Maybe all it will take to get those “former
Pirate fans” re-interested in Pirate baseball is a green
weenie. - 1 I ‘ [3
Taking advantage ‘of the players’ attractiveness
also would be _to the Pirates’ benefit. One
overanxious fan suggested an interesting solution on
a Pittsburgh radio talk show earlier this summer:
“Every time Omar Moreno gets thrown out at second

onan attempted steal,” the caller said, “have "Chuck" '

Tanner come out and throw a pie in his face.” ,3

' ‘ .That could be the answer: a moderate equivalent

of a pie act—something, anything, to attract people
to the North Side. Otherwise, everyone will continue
to leave the stadium unfulfilled. 
Said Buc pitcher Jim Rocker about all those emp” y
seats on game days, p“I hope _we win the division, the
pennant and the Worldseries, thenleave town.” 
That. would be an unfortunate farewell to a team

that since the turn of the century has reveled in great.

  ' Record Jumps to 2-2

ByANNAARLOT‘l‘A
PlttNownSfaff\lIIrltor’

- The Pitt soccer team overpow-

'. stored the Carnegie-‘Mellon Tartans

and emerged with a 1-0 decision
Wednesday night at Pitt Stadium to

even its record at 2-2.

The game-winning goal came 38 ’
minutes into the first half when

A ’ senior wing Tim Pearson hustled to

control a rebound of a shot by

‘fullback Danny Hamm, who got an

assist on the play.

Pearson, who found himself in a
similar situation last year after he
scored in overtime to give the
Panthers a 1-0 victory over Grove
City, believes the team ﬁnally is
jelling into a unit.

“I’m doing my part, which is to
score,” said Pearson,” and every-
one else is doing their part. “CMU
has improved a lot since last year,
and I think the defense and our
goalie, Scott Thunberg, did a great
job to get a shutout.”

" The Panthers dominated play
throughout the evening and out-
shot the Tartans, 17-5. Pitt had
many’ scoring opportunities in
general, and striker Craig Connolly
had many in particular. Connolly
cameclose to scoring a number of
times; two shots hit’ the crossbar,

and one hit the goalpost.

Thunberg almost lost the shutout
on a shot by Keith Hordatt at the

.against tough competition,’

goalmouth.- Pitt coach Leo Bemis
gave Thunberg all the credit for the
shutout.

“Scott seems to be taking charge
and gaining more confidence,”
said Bemis. “He is a hard worker
and is improving a great deal.”

The victory over CMU was

Thunberg’s second in four games;

both have been shutouts.

The Panthers lone goal on 17
shots is below the collegiate
average of one.goal per every nine
to 10 shots. ?

“By the averages,” said Bemis,
“our shooting discipline and shot
selection are areas we’re going to
have to improve.”

According to Pearson, the
Panther offense has improved since
last week’s contest with Slippery
Rock. . ' I '

“The offenses chased the ball
when we lost it, and we had control
of the midﬁeld,” said Pearson.
“We still need to work on our
game, but I do think we were more
mentally prepared for this game.”

The Panthers travel to Temple
Saturday, when a win could earn
Pitt some Eastern respect.

“Saturday at Temple is our big
chance to prove how good we are
’ said
Pearson. “A good showing against
Temple could give us some
much-needed recognition in the
East.

 Spikers Sweep WVU   1

By JEFF nunosxo
Pm News sun wine:
The Pitt'women’s volleyball team
started off the season in a winning
way and swept West Virginia, 15-6,

' 15-6, 15-13 last Saturday.

Head coach Mike Hebert called

 the win “an unimpressive one,
because of the lack of enthusiasm

shown by the girls.” While Pitt
didn't play an outstanding match,
they did ‘play well enough to win.

‘ ‘This was ouriﬁrst match and the
firsttime that we played together, ’ ’
Hebert said, “and it really looked
like it.” Hebert cited Cindy
Chambers as “the only really
consistent playerin the game.”

One reason for the “lack of

enthusiasm" was the team's

continuing injury problems. Maria
Perez started on Saturday, but was

slowed due to recurring knee 1

problems. Hebert’s main concern,

however, is Paula Olsen, who rein- ,
jured a stomach muscle and _

couldn't extend herself. She started
the first game, but sat on the bench.
for the rest of the match. _

Pitt will travel to Philadelphia this
weekend, to compete in the Temple
Invitational tournament. The Pan-
therettes will meet most of their
major competition there, including
Temple, Maryland and Delaware.

“This will be one of the best
tournaments of the year and our
first big test,” Herbert claimed.

The story of

Intramural Department Introduces Sport for Exercise  

ByJIMIaEWlS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt Intramural Assistant Direct-
ors Lou Fabian and Marilyn Ross
don’t need any competition—in
intramural sports, that is.

Together, they formed _a less-

competitive program for students
who ‘enjoy sports for exercise
sake—recreation basketball and
football.

“The teams in these programs
play regular basketball and foot-
bal1—but they must forget about
the score,” Fabian explained.
-“Each night, we have games going
on all three courts. The court where

the two teams score the most are the‘

winners.”
_ Competition is reduced by the
outlawing of contact. '

“We take out all contact,”
Fabian said. “People used to get
mad and even beat up because of
the severity of contact in these
‘sports. By eliminating contact, we
can have teams call their own
games—people become more hon-
est and realistic.”

Fabian and Ross,- both of whom
have a master’s degree in physical
education and administration, real-
ized the problems with convention-
al ‘sports and ‘used physical
education classes to find an
answer. _ '

“We took the leadership classes
and gave them the concept of
less-competitive sports,” Fabian
said. “The 10 students tried to
modify the rules. We then went to
the gym and played the sports with

the new rules, then critiqued‘ the
rules.-”- ’

‘The result: an intramural pro-
gram‘ currently consisting _of' 12
teams that will ﬁnd basketball and
football less ‘bloodthirsty (the
deadline for basketball is today-
for football, next Friday). ‘The
program is unique—-enough so that
CBS will do a documentary on it in
October.

“CBS is hot on us, because we’re
the only University that has used
the concept on traditional sports
like basketball and football,”
Fabian ' claimed. “Others have
created special sports—like people-

passing—in which to use their

theories.
“That idea was good, but‘ who
will drop football, basketball.

 

 passing game,  mislliredlntoo often, will have to click against North Carolina.

hockey—they were fooling them-
selves.”

Although Fabian and Ross favor
less competition, they don’t favor
the abolishment of competition
from society.

“We don’t go against competi-

ltion—it’s of great value to

society,” Fabian said. “We feel
competition has various levels.
Competition in pro football is
different than jogging in a
marathon—joggers“ mainly just try
to ﬁnish a course. We’re not
against competition by any stretch
of the imagination.”

Fabian’s goal is to establish a
recreational program for every
intramural sport at Pitt, to

complement the more competitive ~

sports. . . r -

“We hope the other sports will
adopt a dual philosophy and. let’

students make a choice,” Fabian ‘

said.
