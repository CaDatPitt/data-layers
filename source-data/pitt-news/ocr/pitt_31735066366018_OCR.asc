Stokes Cites Diseases

by MICHELLE PILECKI

“The two ‘crippling diseases,
classism and racism" are the
greatest problems facing Ameri-
ca today, according to former-
Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes.
He spoke at Pitt recently on “Po-
litical Power for Minorities,"
sponsored by the Black Action So-
ciety. . - ,

Stokes noted that classism is
“an economic thing . . . which af-
fects those who have, and pits
them against those who don’t
have.” He pointed out that there
are more poor whites than poor
blacks, “if only because there are
more whites than blacks.” How-
ever, he said, when there are dis-
cussions of welfare cases and low-
income housing problems "they“
speak only of blacks.

“They” don’t want to admit that
there are white poor, said the for-
mer mayor. He mentioned an in-
cident when an Appalacian wom-
an was picked up for distrubing
the peace. Stokes said that when

I he asked the police officer wheth-

er the woman was white or black,
he was told “neither. She's a hill-
billy.” Stokes noted “the officer
knew the woman. wasn’t black,
but he wasn’t going to let her be
white.”

Stokes discussed another exam-
ple of how classism overrides ra-
cism, from his experience as
mayor. “The most bitter fight I
had in Cleveland was in the black
neighborhoods——trying to put low-
income housing into a middle
-class black neighborhood.”

Poor people, both white and
black, have the same political in-
terests, according to Stokes./Dis-

- cussing the current presidential

campaign, he said that/all the can-

Names New  
Chairwoman A

The Black Women‘s Task Force of the Univer
sity has appointed Bernice Wells as chairwomhan for 

a three-month term.

At the end of her term, another person will be 3

appointed for a three month term.

The task force is a semi-autonomous groupﬁ
with the Advisory Council on Women’s Opportun ‘
ity. Elaine Davis notes that the task force is to 
“augment the awareness level of black women on 
campus, in terms of where they should or should not 

be in terms of the movement.”

Last year the group held several “rap sessions"
with blackwomen on campus "to try to determine §
their goals. Davis noted that the task force is just
now planning its schedule, and is not exactly sure
what its program will be, although she stressed

“educational awareness.”

She added “black women are very scarce around
this University in both academic and professional

capacities."

All black women on campus are urged to at-
tend the meetings, which are usuallyweekly. For

Shirley Chisolm, “are . playing
pretty traditional majority po-
litics.”

He noted that the candidates are
“playing the blue collar workers
—‘Midd1e America’—which is the
single largest numerical bloc, and
ignoring other minorities, like the
blacks and elderly.”

Political participation is a “tra-
ditional” solution to the problems
faced by minorities, declared
Stokes. He noted that, when he
was mayor, he "did what Irish-
men, and other groups, did when
they became mayor: I taught my
people what power was like."

He pointed out that any person

 

  

CARL STOKES
or company wishing to do busi-
ness with the city would have to
work with a black official, since

he had placed blacks in “positions

of power."

Stokes mentioned that other
blacks are getting into politics,
citing Charles Evers, defeated
senatorial candidate in Mississip-
pi, and Ed Brooks, Massachusetts
senator. Stokes pointed out that
“Evers campaigned inevery sec-
tion of Mississippi, trying‘ to

reach poor whitesand is still

alive.”,. Stokes noted that the
“times have changed‘ ” recalling

that eight years ago, Evers broth-
er, Medger, was shot “just trying
to get blacks employed in grocery
stores.” Stokes also mentioned
that over 80 cities have black
mayors, and that more govern-
ment officials are black.

Alludiﬁg to the Newark, N. J.,

situation, Stokes noted "being
mayor of a bankrupt city may be
political participation, but very
little comfort.” He added, "How-
ever bad the cities are going.
Newark will get there first."

As for other solutions to urban»
problems, Stokes noted that radi-
cal, but not violent methods must
be used. He did not elaborate on
specific programs, but noted

\ “money isn’t everything, but you

can't do anything wihout that
first fundamental ingredient —
money.’_’

S.tokes is now a -newscaster for
WNBC-TV in New York City. Be-
cause of contractual agreements,
he said, he cannot endorse a can-
didate for president.

In looking back over the 1968
campaign, when he endorsed then-
Vice President ‘Hubert Hum-
phrey, Stokes commented on the
poor turn—out of blacks. “If they
feel they don’t have a choice. they
won't go to the polls.”

Stokes was elected mayor of
Cleveland in 1967, and again in
1969. During his first term he was
the first black to elected first vice
president of the National League
of Cities. He also served on the
Advisory Board of the U.S. Con-

«ference of Mayors, the Steering

-Committee of the National Urban
Coalition and the Advisory Com-
mittee of Urban Americak Inc.

ODI Representation  

by TOM HEIPLE

The issue of student represen-
tation of the Oakland Develop-
ment, Incorporated (ODI), board
is causing strained relations be-
tween some Student Government
and Tenants’ Union Committee
members.

While Dave Bluey of Student
Government (SG) and Tim Ging
of the Tenants’ Union Committee
(TU) think student representation
on the board is necessary, they
are at odds over who should rep-
present the students, the number
of representatives, and what seg-
ments -of the student population
should be ‘represented.

Bluey feels that Frank Little,
the only student currently on the
board, representing the TU, does-
n’t fully represent student inter-
ests because he is a graduate stu-
dent ~

“He’s not an undergraduate,
he’s blocking student representa-
tion, and he’s blocking campus
formation and expansion,” Bluey
stated.

"Little was appointed through
the TU at the request of last
-year's SG,” explained ‘Bluey.
“When they (ODI) organized, the
TU attended and was given repre-
sentation. I don’t want them to get
off but I don’t want Frank Little
on."

“Dave Bluey and Tom Bailey
went to one meeting and decided
they. didn’t like Frank Little,”
Ging claimed.

“The manner they went about
getting rid of Frank is totally ob-
jectionable,” declared Ging.

' ‘x‘Rather than come to me and talk

about it they claimed he couldn’t
represent the undergraduate stu-
dents because he is a graduate
student. They accused him open-
ly at a meeting, putting him on the
spot," Ging said.

“I‘m not opposed to more stu-
dent representatives. I'm opposed
to the methods used to get them
on,” he continued.

Frank Little has his own explan-
ation of his duty. “I don’t repre-
sent SG. I don’t represent stu-

dents. I represent student ten-'

ants.”

He said that he had been going
to the ODI meetings for six
months and claimed the ,SG- had
never been involved in the pro-
ceedings prior to the last meet-
mg

He said that there is a prece- A

dent set by last years SG for grad-
uate students representing the un-
dergraduate student body. The
precedent concerns Sharon No-
vac, a graduate student last year’s
SG helped select as a University
trustee.

“What they're (SG) saying,”
claimed Little. “is that graduate
students can help but not become
members.

Bluey attributed a quote to Lit-
tle at a recent board meeting to
the effect that Little didn’t want
students on the board because
they might become “puppets” of
the University administration.

Little, defending his statement,
claimed, “I do feel thej'7,’.—rep (SG)

 bi_%in‘g_’ju'S.e;:d by the University --

Chancellor Posvar initiallyf A
brought up the idea of SG repre-. "
sentation, notSG itself."  . . .
Little stated that the Universi-' I ~ ' 
ty has been given three votes on
the board to distribute as it saw  
fit. -  = ~
_“One of the reasons it was done “
was to give the diverse segments
of the University representation,_” I I 
Little said. V _ 
He believes that the three votes‘-= I 
could be used to represent the ad- ‘ A
ministration, faculty, and ~:sti‘,1-‘I;fC_ , 
dents, respectively. '  A
“To my knowledge, the Univer;-j . , 
sity hasn't distributed the thre_' “ \
votes,” he said. ‘_ ' » '
“There is an interest from stu...-"Q
dent groups not caused by Univer-
sity pressure,” Bluey maintains.‘ ‘
“We are interested.” ’ /

“All we want is to see the inter-, .
ests of the students involved." ' _ 

Bluey said that SG would like“ T 
to have five student representa- _ _
tives on the board, one each rep-’_',~ *

“This is commendable but it

Additional proposals were pre-
sented to the Dean of Student Af-

ment directors which included the
suggestion that the placement of-

Sell said, “We are setting up an _

“Research indicates that when
veterans don’t graduate it’s usual-

veteran’s academic performance
is usually better than that of the
average student," he stated. V

“Being in the service was a
duty and not a privilege for the

For University Construction

Pitt Requests Conditional Application , ‘

by JIM HOSEK

The University is now awaiting
the decision of the City Planning
Commission in regard to its con-
ditional application to erect three
new structures on University
property.

The three structures would in-
clude a two-story addition to the
rear of Lawrence Hall, a six-story
School of Law building and a six-
story Professional Quadrangle
building to house the School of Ed-
ucation and the Schools of Social
Sciences.

A public hearing held Friday in

the Public Safety Building was

witnessed by both advocates and

adversaries of the plan to build
on the site of Forbes Field.

Bernard J. Kobosky, Pitt’s vice-
chancellor for public affairs, said
that the "method by which the
University arrived at this set of
proposals (to build) is, we believe,
unique. . . -

“We do not pretend that every
difficulty has been resolved, nor
that every citizen is satisfied‘.
But we do feel that there has been
sufficient modification and agree-
ment as to location, siting, scale,
and other aspectsthat are of val-
id concern to citizens to warrant

bringing the-plan before you to——

day fpr a conditional use permit.”
As far as the University is con-

- cerned,_ according to Kobosky,

“these are largely catch-up'pro-
jects. . . . The library of our
School of Law is located on three
different floors in the Cathedral
of Learning and unless there is
some hope of providing adequate
facilities for the school, its ac-
creditation could be in jeopardy.

"At present,” he said, “the Uni-
versity is forced to pay more than
$300,000 a year for rented space
in Oakland. With the availability
of these new facilities, we will be
able to retract from many of
these sites. . . . So in every

sdnse, there are catch-‘up pro-
jects. designed to modernize fa-
cilities, consolidate presently dis-
persed programs. to relieve seri-
ous overcrowding and to release
rented space.

KOBOSKY: Catching Up
Kobosky asked the Commission

to “consider only those aspects.

of the overall ‘project which re-
late directly to the academic
structures“ in the‘ appeal for a
permit, not considering the pro-
posals for traffic changes. ‘

Elizabeth Rial, a Pitt Law stu-
dent, urged the passage of the per-
mit. “This is our eighth or ninth
year waiting for a new Law build-
ing,” she said. '

Thomas M. Hartnett, Carlow
College administrator. speaking
on behalf of the Board of Oakland
Development, Inc. (ODI), said,
“The whole effort (of building) is
toward joint (university-commun-
ity) planning.”

He said that ODI approves of _

the new buildings, but agrees that
the hearing for traffic changes
should be deferred.

Dr. Ralph Coppola of the Cen-
ter Heights Association said that

the “application should be denied '

. when alternative meansare
suitable.”

Construction of the buildings.

he said, would deprive the people
in Oakland of the right to a “good”
environment, since Oakland would

be even more “dominated by the‘

University."

Recognizing the University’s P’

“attempt? to get the community
involved in its future plans for ex-
pansion, Kim Fellner of People’s
Oakland, said that members of the
community were being “_forced to
become amateur'politicians.”

She, however, noted the bene-
fits of Pitt’s compromising with
the community; that Pitt would
not expand across Bouquet St. and
that traffic thruways would be
kept open.

Dennis Unkovic, Pitt Law stu-

dent, said, "The University‘s Law .

Schoolconditions are terrible. . . .
Classes average about 120 stu-
dents.”

Referring to a promise by Pitt
to~.build a new Law School build-
ing a decade ago, he added, “It’s
just been toolong.”

Mayor Peter Flaherty, speak-
ing to the commission, announced’
that the University has agreed to
pay for municipal services to cov-
er tax lossesfrom property clear-
ed in the area of Forbes Field.

Not speaking for or against the
permit, he told the Commission
that their “function and mine
should be tomake sure the proper
planning takes place.”

Tom Bailey, Student Govern-
ment president, afterwards said.

- “I-feel the brunt of -students (as

president) being packed into an
area too small ‘for reasonable
usage.

put on ODI, whether community
or University. The students live

The Pitt road racing team is‘ ineligible for fund-
ing through the Allocations Committee of the Stu-
dent Government Board, 'according. to R. -David
Tive, assistant director of Student Activities and

_acting advisor to the Allocations Committee.

"The rationale for the decision is-.contained in
the by—laws of the Allocations Committee, Article
IV, Section'B, Clause 11 of the Policies "and Proce-
dures for Allocating Funds for Student Organiza-
tions. which states: A‘ ~

“Activities of a varsity nature should be funded
by the Athletic Department. These activities are de-
fined in the following manner:_ If 75 per cent of an

~ organization's competition is funded by activities

fees at their own college, the organization is eligi-i
ble for funding. It is the responsibility of the organ-
ization to do the necessary research.” ‘

Financial mismanagement on the part of the
-road racing team also contributed to this decision,
Tiye added. “The preliminary figures of the team’s
budget, submitted to the Allocations Committee.
did not match the actual budget. The team had a
$1,700 deficit for its first year of operation.”

Commenting on this _deicision, Bernie Pisczek.

 S/tills Stl Rehitslziit F  
-Themes rom “Buffalo”

. by BARBARA GERAUD ~
The Oakland Record Mart reports they haven’t sold a single copy

r_iiorI_.th ago. After hearing it, I can understand why.

 . Mr. Stills, for the benefit of those of you who have been in hiding
for-the past three years, is—when the spirit moves both he and them
¥+'one quarter of the group known a’s.Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
nfortunately, he feels compelled toequal or better their total output

 '_with his own material. And it just doesn’t work. V

, , .‘ v His first album wasn’t hard on the cars at all——he was still lament-
j7‘;.ing the loss of his bluebird, Judy Collins, in such songs as “Dawnto a
,--Flame” and “Do for the Others.” We could sympathize with him on his
'2? loss and enjoy a pretty good album, since he had the likes of Eric Clap-
 ton,.Jimi Hendrix, and some British drummer named “Richie” help-
, ing out. ' .

., __ . On the second album, however. he (started showing just how much
._;,--‘I he d‘oes need this help. There were no big names (though Clapton play-
_ ed) on a couple tracks), just good .old Stephen Stills Superstar and
'. some group he dug up called the Memphis Horns (he should have left

them buried). — .

The album had the requisite themes—social commentary in
“Change Partners,” political commentary in "Relaxing Town,” ecolog-
ical commentary in “Ecology Song,” and the chronicling of how diffi-
cult it is to be a rock star in "Word Game” (which also showed every-
body how Stephen could sing 84 words without taking a breath) (ap-
, plause).

It was almost universally panned, for too many of the songs were
merely rehashes of old themes and old melodies—some dating as far
back as the Buffalo Springfield days.

p ' "So when word came out that the long-awaited Neil Young album
. would finally be on the stands in February, Stephen tried again and real-
. ly put himself together a genuine group, managio. to get not just one.
f‘ but two whole records out. Whoopie-ding! .

j The group’s name is Manassas, which is convenient, isn’t it? They
 2., aren’t too bad,_in some songs actually sound pretty good. Chris Hillman
  (late of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers) plays guitar, man-
” ’ dolin, and co-authored two songs with Stephen.

4 , _ Dillas Taylor, Fuzzy Samuels, and Paul Harris are back on drums,

‘ ; ‘ bass, and piano, respectively. Al Perkins plays a saucy pedal steel gui-

' ; tar and Joe Lala hangs out the rest of the percussions. Some guy named

1.7- , Bill Wyman plays bass on a couplecuts (taking; time off from his reg-
' . ular job with the Rolling Stones).

Stephen has written the majority of the songs by himself, and he

.really seems to have tried to write new stuff. He had to get his political

questionings in on “Fallen Eagle," but they're mercifully kept to a

_ minimum. Perhaps he’s finally realized that he’s not going to have an-
other “For What It’s Worth.”

;_. e, 1‘ _He’s still sorrowful over losing Judy, as “S0 Begins the Task“

L *-;.;!l“"shows. This is an old song from the Buffalo days, which he’s-just now

 V; getting around to recording. It’s a country-flavored tune, and quite

/’ ,  lovely. And he is still looking for a woman to love and understand him.
.  as in "Don’t Look at My Shadow” and “Johnny’s Garden.”

 - The best song onthe four sides is “Colorado,” a paean to his new
:~ yﬂhome. If the state is half as beautiful as this song, this writer is ready
 to move tomorrow.

A,, " A The entire album is dedicated toXimi Hendrix, Al Wilson, and Du-
' ane Allman in memoriam. Maybe if they were alive, they could have
helped poor Stephen. But six or.seven goodsongs doth not a $7.98 al-
bum make worth ,_ buying. Wait and see if Reader's Digest_“puts.-ou_t,a.

His group consists of Schmoe
Piddley on guitar, Neal Parmesi-
an on bass, and Rock Slide on
drums. They’re excellent musici-
ans, and laid a good foundation for
Zit and the Hot Rods to swing out
on.

As for the Hot Rods, they were
tremendous. There were three of
them—two guys and a girl—Rod-
ney McGrease, Frankie Ava-
lanche and Greasy Slick. I had
talked to them while they were
setting up before the show, and
the "transition from pre-show to
on stage was extraordinary. They
changed from clean-cut, average-
looking young adults (Greasy is
really pretty) to three of what we
called “hoods” in my long-ago
high school years. '

They had done their homework
well. I had to keep looking around
to remember I was in Gateway
Plaza and not back in some
sweaty high school gym‘ 13 years
before. The songs all took, us
back — “Blue Suede Shoes," “All
Shook Up" (and boy-,' can Zit

shakel), "Little Darlin’,” "Jail-_

house»sRock.” and “Donna.”

. During “One Last Kiss,” a girl
named Laura,‘ who was sitting
near me, gotjup on her boyfriend’s
shoulders and they wove ‘their
way up to the stage so she could
be kissed by Zit. This elicited
screams and moonings from the
rest of the females in the area,
and a general rush to the stage.

Frankie Avalanche did a great
version of “Tell‘ Laura I Love

At Fine  _ Building

Her,” Greasy sang “Leader of
the Pack,” and Rodney (who can
sound a lot like Scott English)
wailed through “Chantilly Lace”
and “Little Honda.”

, Meanwhile Zit took a “grease
break” to change into his gold
lame shirt and add some hair to
his chest. «(And he threw some of
it—very generously — out to the
audience. I’ll treasure the lock I
caught forever!)

The audience wouldn’t let him
off the stage — though the eight
“guards” that had been standing
around were obviously anxious to
get their leader off and awa_v

- from the adoring crowd.

 

  Student Exhibit WorthVie\ving 

by JEFFREY C. MINAHAN ’

A new and fine collection of art
works by Pitt students is now be-
ing displayed in the galleries of
the Frick Fine Arts building.

The opening of the exhibition
was held on Saturday evening,
May 28, complete with wine,
hors d’oeuvres,‘ and music. The
music of Kardomah mingled with
groups of people sipping wine and
discussing art.

Jane Harrison, student, co-or-
dinator, and her assistants, David
Ferguson and Betty Yee, ar-
ranged the displays to the credit
of the Studio Art Department. Yet,
not discounting the pleasant at-
mosphere, the real value of the
evening wasthe art itself.

It is impossible to describe the

quality of the works of each of the
artists whoseitalents were rep-
resented. Yet, the worksiof three
individuals seemed to stand out.

The work of Mary Vidmuk is
striking in its bold and intricate
patterns usually contrasted with
simple figures. In her painting,
“Selma,” the viewer can almost
feel the pressure of the body on
the cushions. Vidmuk's style is
tasteful when it could easily have
fallen into gaudiness.

David Ferguson’s print work is
extremely pleasing to the eye, es-
pecially his “Untitled Special

“Study,” which gives the impres-
sion of three-dimensionality by
the technique’, of placing part of
the composition on the paper and
part on the glass cover. His work
is delicate and hints at a form

Zit Blemish New Face Of Rock ’n Roll

So Zit came back for two num-
bers — “Hound Dog” (after ask-

ing us to quiet down for, ‘as he.

wanted us to hear the “motifs and
intermost meanings of the
words”) and “I Can't Control My-
self,” The local highlight of
that number was a twist con-
test in front of the stage, led by
two of the local street freaks -
“Vec” and “M.D.”

Promptly at 10. though, he left,
blowing kisses and promising to
return. We quickly took our leave,
to return to the humdrum 1972-ish
atmosphere of downtown Pitts-
burgh, trying to get out of~the
rain.

al drama of their last years has
intrigued movie audiences
throughout the years. Producer
Sam Speigel and Director Frank-

I lin J. Shaffner have transformed

it into a dull and overly done melo-
drama.

As a large scale epic, it is at
least a valid attempt to be more
than just a showcase for lavish
costumes and widesweeping pana-
romas of scenery. Schaffner in-
cludes “meaningful” scenes about
the sad condition of Russia and
attempts to explain the reasons

just the Romanovs, he dramatizes
fictionalized conversations be-

‘ tween the two Russian revolution-

aries, Lenin and,Trotsky. To make
matters worse, their lines are be-
yond believability. Thus the con-
tinuity and the movie, as a whole,
suffer.

Basically, Nicholas and Alex-
andra portravs the two monarchs
as ordinary people incapable of
coping with their problems and
on the brink of violent conse-
quences.

Alexandra continually frets
about her s0n’_S hemophilia like a
neurotic housewife on one of the
daily soaps. Nicholas, on the other
hand. remains stoic and seems
uninterested with his plight. Both
characters are lost in the stag-

()akland’s Rock People

by AMOS HALL

One of the most prominent, yet
rnost often overlooked. art forms
an campus is the statuary. A care-
ful study of these objets d’art in
Oakland clearly reflects the po-
litical and social changes which
have swept the campus. the wide
variety of activities which have
occurred here over the years. the
sexual perversion of several
sculptors and. last but not least
but not least. the diet of the aver-
age Oakland pigeon.

An overview of these works of
art indicates the coherence with

' which the campus was planned.

What foresight our early adminis-
trators must have had. How else
could these planners have seen fit
to place a statue of Honus Wag-
ner and Zeus side by side in Frick
Park?

Two well developed themes are
reflected in all the works, anarchy
and tastelessness.

High atop Alumni Hall (home
of the Chemistry Department, the
University Chapter of the Military
Industrial Complex and several
mountain goats put out to pasture
by the Biology Department)
perches Big Bird, representing
the conservative, nationalistic
spirit of Pitt.

The great stone eagle hovers
over the entire campus, coldly
eyeingythe activities of all below,
the ultimate right winger.

A strange group of legends cen-
ter around this great stone (or is
it cement?) masterpiece. Several
members of the local chapter of
Young Americans for Freedom
swear that they have seen the
eagle flap its majestic wings ap-
provingly when the campus ROTC
contingent marched by. Other stu-
dents adamantly maintain that
Big Bird laid a massive stone egg
on the day. Lawrence Lee, pro-
fessor of English and conserva-
tive columnist for the Pittsburgh
Press, refused to debate SDS
members. ‘

After the last antiwar rally sev-
eral SDS members claimed that

the eagle left its perch and attack--

ed them with its talons, but this
report cannot be verified because

few students cared enough to at-
tend the demonstration.

In front of the Carnegie Mu-

seum stands one of Pittsburgh's,

most interesting and revealing
historical works. Stephen Foster
and Stepin Fetchit. This work
clearly indicates the racist atti-
tudes which prevailed in Pitts-
burgh at the time of its erection.

Note that Stephen Foster (one
of the must world’s most famous
plagiarists) is sitting on a stump
above the humble Fetchit, and
That Foster is dressed in a fine
suit while Fetchit is poorly clad
and barefoot (a sad sight on a cold
winter’s day).

Fetchit is portrayed perform-
ing one of his tunes. while Foster
industriously copies down the
words in his little plagiarism
book.

One work. which used to stir the
blood of patriotic students. con-
tinues to stir blood on campus.
but in a different way. This fig-
ure. known to antiwar activists as
John Wayne (because of the re-
markable resemblance), stands
on the Frick Fine Arts Building
lawn. staring dejectedly at the
passers by.

Recently pacifist students, an-
tiwar demonstrators and desper-
ate pigeons have desecrated the
Big Jawn repeatedly with vari-
ous types of white material of the
exact quality of this coating
varies with the nature of the don-

0!‘

However. at least one statue on
campus is dedicated to students
with leftist, hippy tendencies.
This is the statue of the Crucified
Student attached to the wall of the
Graduate School of Public Health
building.

Students in the Health Related
Professions have dedicated the
work to the dental student who
was ousted for refusing to cut his
hair. Most maintain that the
works represents his treatment
by the Dental School administra-
tion. but others claim that the
framework of the gold plated stat-
ue is actually the students bones.
placed in a prominent spot as a
warning to would be rebellious
students. ‘

The lighter side of Oakland's
history is reflected by the dashing
figure of Honus Wagner on dis-
play outside of the Old Forbes
Field site.

Perhaps the most sexist works
on campus is the figure of Zeus
and an Obliging Goddess located
in the center of a fountain in front
of the Fine Arts building. As Zeus
calmly sits anticipating the pleas-
ures to come, his lady love slith-
ers into his lap. nude, strumming
a lute. This particular statue was
strategically draped when Kate
Millet and Betty Friedan appear-

ed on campus for speaking en-

gagements.

Undoubtedly’ the most stimulat-
ing figure on campus is Fig Leaf.
the friendly doorman at Pitt’s
Athletic Department. The nude
figure is the department’s tribute
to Burt Reynolds.

Although the name of the gym
is Trees Hall, the only evidence
of a tree is a fig leaf which mod-
estly serves as an athletic sup-
port for poor Bertie.

Clearly, a tour of the statutory
of Pitt can be a rewarding experi-
ence. It can also be a terrible
bore. So next time you're walking
by one of these magnificient
creations, take a closer look. You
might get the surprise of your
life. but if you’re lucky the pigeons
may be roosting elsewhere.

Jump in NCAA’s

by VINCE DiNARDO
Sports Editor

Pitt’s OlympicVTrials'goer and

long jumping sensation Bill Rea

came within one half inch of
winning the NCAA long jump
national championship at Eu-
gene" Oregon during the week-
end, in the national track cham-
pionships. _

‘Rea, who’ uncorked a‘26’ 74"
jump a few weeks ago at the
Pitt Invitational.- which at that
time was the longest jump by a
collegian, could have surpassed
that and had the longest jump
in the nation this year as well as
a -national championship were

A lot of schools‘ should have been thinking
about Greg also. He led his team to the Catho-°
1ic'League Class A state title game with a 19
point average and a 12«rebound per game. Mc-
Bride shot 50 per cent from the floor and 79 per
cent from the charity strip onroute to the team's

~» 19-5 final record. Not bad for a big man.

"We had a big ‘ahp_ a balanced team at‘

‘ we‘had a 6’6" and a 6’5” ‘man. All three of us

could have scored a lot r_nore on other teams but

Ridl _has said more than once that he likes

the course of the race.

.“That adds up to something
like two to four seconds for ‘an

Significantly, the last three fast-

Other discrepancies were found
in the ‘running lanes and in the

In the Saturday trials, a rather.

were reluctant, I think we made

Substantiating- the Road Rac-

that half of the 40 car field
failed to finish.
‘ “Instead of ruining the only
engine we have,- we sat down
and talked about it and came’

continued.

watched the race, Fryer admit-

~“It was disappointing we

there was so much we learned

“Attitude is also important. I

physical ability, but he might have
a better attitude, a winning atti-
tude.'

Now that sounds just like coach
Ridl.

McBride reminds one of another

team to the Class A Catholic
league title. And like Bolla, Mc-
Bride is 6’7”. - ,

McBride indicated that he has a
lot of confidence, but also that he
will‘ work hard this summer to
better himself. He plans to play
in a summer league with his
cronies at South Catholic as well
as working out at Pitt with the
rest of Ridl’s men.

When McBride learned that Pitt

  A Scratch  

was interested in him, right‘after
theRoundball classic, the deci-
sion to come to Pitt was facilited.
_ Only time wi1l~tell if what Ridl
saw at the Roundball classic will
turn out to be an indept insight.

Special to the Pitt News

, The Pittsburgh Pirates missed
 a chance to move up still closer
7.''''to ,the front running New York
»>M_ets in ‘the National League’s
Eastern Division last night, but
 through no fault of their own.

 Trailing the Mets by three and
<II;..¥'a, half games the Pirates were

 dres, the only game scheduled in
, the Senior Circuit yesterday. Now
' the Bucs will have to wait until
 tonight to start the second leg of
their West Coast trip as Bob
"Moose (3-2) is sighted to op-
pose the Padres’ Ron Kirby (3-6).

On Sunday the Pirates took bet-
ter advantage of their opportuni-
ties. Secure with the knowledge
that the Braves had manhandled
Yogi Berra’s crew 9-3, the Bucs
had the incentive to turn back
the faltering San Francisco Giants

_ twice, 4-3, and 9-1. It was the sec-

 ll ond straight Sunday double-

 header the Pirates took both ends
7 of. with their victim last week

 being the skidding Philadelphia
, Phillies. :

In the opener the Bucs found
themselves down 3-2 as the game
rolled into the late innings. Three

_ straight singles by Manny: San-
 guillen, pinch-hitter Vic Dav-

aillio and Al Oliver accounted

for the tying run. After Willie-

Stargell, batting for relief pitch-
er Bob Miller, struck out, Milt
May stood in for Gene Alley and
sent a drive to right which brought
Davalillo across the plate with
V the go-ahead run.

. Dave Giusti came in to silence
the Giant bats in the last two
innings and preserved the victory
for Miller. Miller’s record now
stands at 3-1. Luke Walker
started the game but only went
five innings. He gave up all three
Giant tallies.

The secondigame was over al-
most before it started as the Buc
bats came alive in the second
inning, cementing a five-run
lead that was never touched. Los-
ing pitcher Carl,..William,s didn’t
know what hit him as singles by
Jose Pagan and Milt May follow-
ed by a blasting double by win-
ning pitcher Bruce Kison was
enough to K.O. the young mounds-
man. Three more Giant pitchers
couldn’t stem the tide as the Bucs
added one run in the fourth, two
in the sixth and one in the eighth.

Kison, who has been used spar-
ingly because of a sore arm he
contracted during the winter,

showed little sign of fatigue as"

he went the distance giving up

Season Penguin Pact

The Pittsburgh Penguins announced the signing of one of their
;op young players to a multi-year contract.

General Manager Jack Riley. upon returning from a two day

trip to Toronto. announced that‘ goalie Jim Rutherford has agreed‘

to terms for two years at what
Riley termed, “a well deserv-
ed substantial raise.”

The 23-year old netminder
will be starting his second season
with the Penguins. He was ac-
quiredin the Intra-League Draft
last June from the Detroit Red
Wings when the Wings left him
unprotected after claiming Al
Smith from the Pens.

The native of Beeton, Ontario
was an all star goalie with Ham-
ilton of the OHA and was the
first pick in the Amateur Draft
by Detroit in 1969. He turned
professional and played with
Fort Worth of the Central Hock-
ey League in 1969-70. The follow-
ing season he played with the
Red Wings.
