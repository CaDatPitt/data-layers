All records for placing men in full time positions within the period
of one week were shattered last week. in the employment bureau when

housing employment bureau that most of the men will be placed.
Among the several concerns which employed the men, a local pub-

will be employed in conductin-g a sur- '

Pittsburgh district for a period of
three months. At the end of this
time, the most capable of tlie_work-

supervise the work in other cities.
- Although every effort was made
to place part-time men in the posi-

such that full-time service was ne-

The hiring of Pitt men by the

of contact established with the com-

Mr. Williams. The employment bu-

most two days were spent telephon-

ly’ elected president for 1931-32.

Approximately one hundred and
ﬁfty schools will" participate in the

other year. In order that ideas may
be exchanged and the schools may
become acquainted with each.other’s
activities, the delegates have been
asked to bring an exhibit, made up
of the clippings from their associa-
tion's publicity, a copy of their
point-scale system and a copy of
their by-laws. ‘

blies, round twble discussions and
business meetings, the delegatesto
the convention will be entertained
with a formal dance, ,3, breakfast,

ning at the close of the’ convention.

egates’ stay at the convention en-
joyable is that they will reside at
the new Women’s League building
at the University. This ‘building,
which was recently completed, has
been built especially to house the
different women’s organizations on
the campus. It also contains rooms
for visitors withthe conveniences of

was particularly stressed by Miss
Rush, who discussed the origin of
the coronation. P-reviously there
was a typical May Day ceremony
with a queen chosen for any reason
at all. There really was no digni-
ﬁed ceremony in which all gradu-
ating women could participate, such
as the one which has been used for
the last ﬁve years. That the pre-
vious type of festival was unsatis-
factory was shown by the small
tum-out which witnessed the gam-
bols on the campus.

Six years ago. Miss Amos, dean
of women, was instrumental in cre-
ating the present elaborate cere-
monial celebration. The Queen is
elected for her representative qual-
ities as a member of the graduating
class, and .as she is crowned in the
same way that the Anglo-Saxon

nounces the result of last Wednes- I

ducted, every graduate is crowned
with her. This makes the event
less of a personal triumph for one
member of the senior class, and
more of a valedictory for each
graduate. »
The crowning of the queen in-
volves all the regalia of the old An-
glo-Saxon court. Here are train-
bearers, an armored interpretation
of valor, wisdom and virtue, re-
galia-bearers, canopy-bearers, herb-
strewers and ‘princesses who attend
the queen. These will all be selected
by the class nominating committee
and will receive notice of their elec-
tion within the next fewweeks. Re-
hearsals will begin soon afterward.
The ﬁrst coronation of‘ Senior
Queen was solemnized in 1926 when
Kathleen Bergson started the royal
lineage which includes Mary Flor-
ence Taylor, Ruth Matteson. Mabel

YW  Cabinet

Application, Interview New
Appointment Procedure

Announcement has been made by
the executive committee of Y. W.
C. A. ofaichange in the method of
selecting cabinet officers for the or-
ganlzation.

In the past the committee heads
have been selected by the executive
board, after careful consideration of
the women's ability for the position.
However, although the committee
was open to suggestions from vari-
ous people associated with the Y. W.
C. A., they feel that many times
they have overlooked women who
were vitally interested in contrib-
uting their ideas to the work of the
organization.

In order to make it possible for
women who wish to become closer
associated with Y. W. C. A. to work
in an executive capacity, the execu-
tives have planned this new method
of procedure. .

Any woman who wishes to come
more closely into the Y. W. C. _A.
fellowship, who is willing to SW9
her. leadership in crcati_n,g.a better
a more useful organization, may

e the initiative in applying for
membership of the cabinet, which 15
constituted by the committee heads
of the standing committees. Thls
formal application is to be made at
the Y. W. C. A. office and at this
time the a ‘cant will arrange for
an informal ‘conference with Miss
Battrick, Y. W. C. A. secretary, and
one or more of members of_ the Exec-
utive committee. At the‘ tulle of her
conference the candidate will be ex-
 to state simply What she
wouldvlike Y. W. C. A. to mean on
campus andwhat she feels able to
.contribute towards this a.iI_n~

The applicant's scholastic record
will be approved by the point scale
committee... _ . _

The ﬁnal selection of _the candi-
dates will be made in new of the
following "points: , real _mterest in
Y. W. C, A. purp096;_d0811'8 for per-
sonalnﬁlrltual maturity; _leaderslup.
perso ity and special interest or
knowledge in some speciﬁc branch of
the association work.

Margaret Rodgers‘, Col. ’32, pres-
ident,-of Y. W. C. A., stated as the
reason for making this change:
“The executive committee desires to
give adequate consideration‘ to ever)’
woman especially equipped to C8-‘Pry
on the. activities of the organlzatlon.
Far from making appointments
more formal it willcreatc a more
liberal and lust relationship ‘between
newly selected officers, cabinet and
memberslulp at large. All women in-
terested may feel perfectly free to
apply at once.”

Collembola Club :5 Make
Trip to Cook’: Forcat

Maurice A. Mook, instructor of
sociology, addressed members of the
Collembola Club on “Cultural An-
thropology” at a meeting of the or-

ganization held at Wesley Hall, lastl

nlght.

Plans were made for a field trip
to Cook’: Forest on the first and
second of May. The trip will be
made by machine and the cavalcadc
will leave Zoology Main Hall at 9
o’clock on Saturday morning. The
return trip will be made. Sunday
night.

Cook's Forest, properly known as
Cook’s Forest National Park, is 120
miles north of Pittsburgh near Cla-
rion, Pa. It is a reservation for
wild plant and animal life. Al-
though the purpose is to study wild
flowers, some will study centipedes,
butterﬂies, cocoons and insects aThis
is the first time that thé Tfdfiembola
Club has visited Cook’s Forest in
the spring time.

Campers

There was also some discussion
of the scholarship fund. Every year
the club gives a scholarship which
covers the tuition for one year to
the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
at Long Island.

Applications for the scholarship
should be’ made by letter to the club
president not later than May 15.
The scholarship is awarded at the
end of May by a committee of three
including a professor of zoology, a
professor of botany and the presi-
dent of the club. The scholarship
is awarded on the basis of grades,
interest in biology and general per-
sonality. Anyone may make appli-
cation.

 

Keep Present ‘
Council Form

(Continued I from Page One)

arrangements exclude any students
but those named by the committee
to run for the legislative body. It
was argued in Council session that
this plan would assure a more repre-
sentative tge of student torun for
election at e annual spring vote.

Thus, after several months of dis-
cussion, disagreementwand heckling
which at times gave indlcatipns of
ﬂaring u-p into open warfare among
council representatives, the status of
the undergraduate legislature for
next year appears to have been deﬁ-
nitely settled by the action at Wed-
nesday's meeting.

Miss Hunter and Sterling, who
were reelected by internal vote have
been active members of the gov-
erning bod throughout, the present
year. Ster ing has recently occupied
a prominent position because of his
staunch opposition to the "ill-fated
M. S. G. A. proposal. He also served
on the Constitutional’ committee and
was largely responsible for adoption
of the new ‘plan of election as ac-
cepted -by Council this week.

He is a member of Druids, Delta
Tau Delta, Pepper Prize committee
and Sigma Tau engineering frater-
nity.

Miss Hunter has played a promi-
nent role in undergraduate activities
throughout her three years in school.
‘She has been a member of the Yule-
tide Festival committee for two
years, and of the'W. A. A. board for
the past year. She is also a mem-
ber of Cwens, the 1931 Junior prom
committee, and Delta. Delta. Delta.
She was recently selected “Cam us
Queen” in the recent Weekly—Pan er

Another man’s “ground trouble”
is enabling Ethel Anderson, Col. '30,
graduate of Pitt and the Penn
School of Aviation, to do some hi h
ﬂying. Clarence D. Chamberlin, a-
mous airman, was grounded by the
Department of Commerce for a week
an ﬁned ﬁfty dollars for letting
his pilot’s license lapse, ﬂying with-
out it, and disobeying air traffic reg-
ulations. Recently he declared,
“What I’ve been needing is a ﬂying
secretary, so I hired one to do my
ﬂying for me. She’s a competent
office worker and she has a private
pilot's license, so she can fly me
around the countr".”

Miss Anderson's selection for the
position of Chamberlin’s “aerial
chauffeur” and secretary was large-
ly a matter of luck paving the way
for ability. Her training was ex-
cellent, her opportunity, fortunate.

Two Weeks’ Campaign Gets

Good Results on Campus

Monday is the last day for Sen-
iors to order June commencement
announcements, according to I. M.
Kreimer, Dent, chairman of the
committee. After a two weeks’
campaign, ‘during which favorable
progress was made, members of the
committee reported good results.
The campaign started Wednesday,
atpril 8, and comes to a close Mon-

3Y- ,

The’ booklets this year, according
to the chairman, are the most beau-
tiful in years. The design which
consists of the Cathedral centered on‘
a gold background on blue-grooved
leather is digniﬁed and simple. , ,

Appearing also in. the announce-
ments willbe unpublished views of
the Cathedral with interior’ phases.
In addition, there will be an ou-t-
line of senior events and alumni
meetings. The cardboard announce-
ments will contain exactly the same
contents as the leather booklets.

C. H. Elliot, Philadelphia, has
been given the contract for the work
and will have the booklets on the
campus within‘ a month. New en-
gravings and printing processes are
to. be included in this year’s work.
Orders may be given today to mem-
bers of the committee. 1

Miss Anderson won a scholars '
while attending the University hid
fered by the Women's Advertising
Club of Pittsburgh entitling her to
a course in ﬂying. She enrolled in
the Penn School of Aviation and
received a practical course in ﬂying
under Mrs. Louise aden, winner
of the Cleveland Air Derby. Miss
Anderson took a theoretical course
in aviation in the night school
course afforded by the University.
Ethel Anderson, while enrolled as 3,
student here, was president of thg
Alpha Delta Pi Sorority.

Mr. Chamberlin explained why he
selected Miss Anderson for his sec-
retary: “Not long ago I had a letter
from her asking whether I couldn't
suggest some way to get in‘ more
air time, so when the Department of
Commerce gave me my spanking I
gave her the job.”

Alice Won ’t Sit By The Fire,
But The Children Tame Her

“Alice-Sit-By-theFire” is not the
type of woman who sits by the ﬁre,
but James M. Barrie makes her ac-
cept this quiet life in the play which
Pitt Players will present on May
14, at the Y. M. and W. H. A. audi-

‘ toriurn.

Put yourself in Alice’s place. Her
husband is an army officer in India

and she has spent the last ﬁve years
there. Her children have grown up
while she was away and as children
will, expect to see her practically
gray with age,—-Alice, who has been
the belle of all the Indian stations!

Her eldest daughter, Amy, 17,
from constant attendance at thea-
ters is on the lookout for the eternal
triangle to pop up in her mother’s
life. Her son, Cosmo, 13, cannot un-
understand why she would like fun
and jollity,-—he thinks such things
belong on y to “young” ladies. Even
her baby who is ony 2-years-old,
cries when she picks er up.

When an old friend, Steve, who
had known her in India returns and
ﬂatters Alice’: vanity after the slaps
her son and daughter have given it,
the way is clear for the eternal tri-
angle. Amy thinks she must save
her mother from the disgrace of be-
ing kissed by any man other than
her husband. It is here that the
comedy of the situation comes to the
fore. Barrie makes the play light,
entertaining drawing-room comedy.
Oh, yes, and he is whimsical, too.

Perhaps the most interesting part
about the first act (of course it
wouldn't be fair to tell you about the
other acts; you’ll want to see them

.. 1 r yourelf is the stag which rep-
 ?-.;l=ur-, drtweht room as ’.

 

it has been partially decorated by
the hand of romantic Amy.

The interesting part is that Amy
never ﬁnishes what ‘she starts, con-
sequently the room looks as if it

was designed by a modern decora-

tor who changed his mind a couple
of ti.mes while he was planning the
rooms and then decided to make it
a Period room—every period—from‘
that of the reign of the Pharoahs to
the ascension of King George
England.

Amy gets all her ideas from two
magazines, “The Boudoir Gossip”
and “Art in the Home.” And when
you see the room which Amy has
decorated with suggestions from
these sources you'll be glad they
never really existed.

Mr. Cass has chosen a cast of
seven seniors and two juniors to
take the various roles.

They cut off the supply of oxygen

‘What's Up?’ Reacheslieights
In Cap-Gown Productions
Asserts Pitt-Pourri

By SUNNY WESLAGEB
What's Up must come down!
The ﬁnal descent of a successful six-
day flight. V
Over the hazards for a hole in one!

Tomorrow Ca and Gown Club
presents the fins. Pittsburgh show-
ing of its 1931 vehicle, “What's
Up?” at the Nixon Theater. Since
the premiere, Monday night, when
the production was sponsored by the
Civic Club of Allegheny County, and
patronized by Pittsburgh Society, it
has been playing to capacity.crowd_s.
Tonight, Director William Marlatt’s
boys will be playing to a student au-
dience.

This reviewer feels that the cast,
chorus, and technical performance
this year eclipse any other Cap and
Gown offering for many a year. It
is only such an adept personnel, aid-
ed by an excellent undergraduate or-
chestra, that could lift the script
from mediocrity. More undergradu-
ate inﬂuence on the lines might give
them less pseudo-professional strain,
and more amateur spontaneity simi-
lar to that which distinguishes the
acting. Fresher shows, too, are cre-
ated by adding more humorous in-
cidents, as in the Austin Scene, and
omitting the stale pun gagging.

Group routines that are superior
include “My Suppressed Desire,” and
that delightful satire: “Super Art
Pictures, I Love You.” “The Song of
the Pirates” was goodbut not loud.
“Machinal” and electrified “Light
Feet” gain in effect what they sac-
riﬁce in originality.

The lgarrulous Roy (Divot sales-
man) Magram and John (Mrs.)
Harpster render their parts to per-
fection. Tap dancers in Cap and
Gown have never'equa.1led the step-
ping of Eugene Kelly -and William
Pillich. "Jack (Betty) Allen _ kicks
higher and better than ever. Buente,
Hatcher and Weissman shine with a
mellow rendition of “Tuck Me In
Your Heart,” and “Sea Song.” A

great deal of comedy is overlooked.

by not giving more lines to Neidig
and Kirkland. As a fat aunt and al-
most fat cousin they are .funny;
they could be screamingly funny.
When the blue and gold curtain
drapes over the ﬁnals of‘ this avia-
tion-miniature golf travesty, one
feels that he has seen, not a ‘great,

but a good show. As the spots flash '

on the gold seals and the" strains. of
Alma Mater die away, one only re-
grets, to quote a Pitt professor, that
the performance has not been entire-
ly “of, by, and for undergraduates.”

Moss Addresses YMGA
On llacelllelalions ’

Mr. C. D. Moss of the Urban
League addressed a meeting of the‘
Interracial Commission of the Y. M.
C. A. last week on “Popular Fal-
lacies of Race Relations.” Mr. Moss
gave a new view of  relations of
one race to another and about the
many false conceptions which cur-
rent publicaitions tend; to create
among the great mass of people.

“The great difficulty which di-
vides progress between the various
races and society is that groups
don’t realize how the other half
lives,” declared Mr. Moss. “Each
race permits its false conceptions to
dominate it in its attitude towards
those of other groups.”

Speaking of the “short-sight
policy” Mr. Moss continued, “Cer-

impossible for the different group
that has to live under them And then
turns around and condems that par-
ticular group for living under the
conditions which the condemning
grou inﬂicted. Racial prejudice will
brea down when races come in con-
tact and begin to understand and

Student ailbag

To Editor of The Weekly:

1'. week, in announcing that
Charles A. Seidle, Col. '31, is going
to « Lingnan University, Canton,
China, The Weekly mentioned that
he is going as a Y. M. C. A. repre-
sentative. '

This was undoubtedly a misunder-
standing as I understand that Seidle
is going as a faculty member, entire-
ly independent of any organization-—
religious or secular. . _

Moreover, although the Y. M. C. A.
is ‘co-operating fully, we are not the
sponsors of the “Pitt in China"
movement which is being handled by
an all-Pitt student committee.

Women To Subsist Without

Caviarlf Prospects For

Poor little college girls!
They'll have to do without their
caviar and live on just plain fish
eggs.

Isabelle Anderson, ~ assistant’

to the dean of, women, in an-
swer to our query as to whether
there would be any jobs, beg
pardon, positions, negated em-

no. -
So far no requests for the
cream of the crop have been re-
ceived at the oﬂices, audit looks
very much as though unemploy-
ment is resl, or, impossible
thought, maybe some employers
don’t think college girlsare the
cream of the crop.

Several girls, who wrote away

ceived only the vaguest of an-
swers. Miss A.nderson’s opinion
is that there" is pratically no

. chance for any kind of work.

Now, for some smoralizing.
Are college girls justified in
even seeking for. jobs which
might mean Vtlleif very subsist-

The Pitt varsity‘ tennis team
Opened its season last Saturday by
trouncing the Bethany tennis team
to the tune of 7-0. The Pitt men
had very little difficulty in s'ubduin._g
the Bethany netmen. . Most. of the
matches were decided before, the
first set was completed. . .0

In. the .ﬁitst match. ;,,G_apta.in. . Eddie;
Jacobs had little t-rouablez in sulbdu‘-'.
a
slow start, Jacobs speeded up, and_
served ace after ace to win his set-
to by the score of 6-2, 6-0. ' In the
second match “Milt” Cohen won al-

most as handily over Cowdery of

Bethany by the score of 6-2, 6-3.

“Irv” Goodman won the next sin-
gles ‘match, defeating Nelson. 6-2,
6-1. This match was very f1ast‘with
Goodman just too good for Nelson.
Adler defeated Erskine by the score
of 6-3, 6-4. s ‘

» One Close Match

The next match between Bloom of '
Pitt and eckman of vBetha.ny,' was
the closest of the singles contests.
The first set was won by Bejckrnan
by the score of 9.-7. This set pro-'
duced theclosest playing of.tfhe.en-
the contest. . Each man won his own

. service until the match was even at

7-7. Beckman then broke through
Bloom’-s service and took his own‘ to
win the first . match. The second

V. match was fairly easy for Bloom.

The third set was also productive of

5 Regulations

There is apparently an old Greek
custom which does not pemnit that
nationality to show up at a sched-
uled meeting of major importance,

‘for last Thursday but four frater-
nities sent representatives to the
conclave called for the purpose

of drawing up rules and regulations
for the mushball tournament spon-
sored by the Weekly sports stall‘.

At first, the staff became dis-
gusted and tempted to forego the
tournament; but upon second
thought, it decided to take matters
into its own hands and to leave the
e.nEra.n~ts the duty of carrying them
ou .

Thirteen fraternities and one non-.
Greek team have notiﬁed the spon-
sors of their desire to enter
tournament. The teams entered are
Theta Chi, Delta Sigma Phi, Omega
Delta, Phi Kappa, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, Sigma Alpha Mu, Pi Lambda
Phi, Phi Epsilon Pi, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Nu, Phi
Gamma Delta, Delta Tau Delta and
a team composed of the faculty
members and majors in the history

department.
Need Fields

The greatest difficulty confronting
the team is the lack of playing
ﬁelds. ‘At present but two ﬁelds in
the vicinity are known to be avail-
able for the mushers, the Ruskin lot
and a ﬁeld at the corner of Millvale
avenue and Baum Boulevard.

joining the tennis courts may be ob-
tained; but in case it is, the players
will be forced to wear soft shoes,
as hard shoes would cut up the turf.‘

Fair Basketball Success

By MORRIS COHEN '

(Note: The following is the i
first of It. series of articles on
Pitt basketball dating from 1905
and continuing down to the
present time.)

 

Announcement for next season of
a thirty-game -basketball schedule
which needs only the approval of the
athletic council to become; official re-
calls the development of the sport
here from 1905 when Pitt was just
“Wup” and the team was fortunate
to secure one victory out of ten
games.

_At that time, most of the teams
met by Wup were only of class B
calibre. Wooster, Westminster,» Gen.-
eva, Grove City, Allegheny and Penn
State were the schools on the 1905
schedule.

Beat Geneva

Wup’s lone victory that season
was scored over Geneva, 24-18; but
the Covenanters came back to win
the return game, 28-18. Wup made
its best showing of the season in
these two games, all the other tilts

victories for the opposing team. Al-

State did likewise, 30-4.

”'*‘»5Wup scored but 164 points that
year while its opponents totaled 277.
an average of 16.4 points per game

27.7 for its opponents.

Things beganto pick up for W-up
thevfollowing season when the team
ﬁnished with a record of six vic-
tories and ﬁve defeats after it had
lost its first four games. The team
that year was very inconsistent, how-
ever, for while it won over West
Virginia, 44-10, and Grove City, 41-

scores of 20-26 and 16-34, respec-
tively.
Trounce Tech Twice

The bright spot of the team’s rec-
ord that year was its two victories
ove-r Carnegie Tech, 36-14 and 26-
12.. Mount Union, Westminster and
Allegheny were the other teams met
that season. Pitt, or Wupas it was
still called, scored 335 points while
its opponents tallied 268.

Wup’s record the following ye-ar
was better than that of 1906-07, and
the team ﬁn<is«hed' with eleven vie-
tories out of sixteen games. Car-

negie Tech, West Virginia and Ma- -

rietta all lost two games apiece to
Wu.p,in_ the high spots of the season.

Inconsistency still marked the play
of the Panthers at thistime.
They defeated West Virginia rath-
er easily in one game,‘ 58-20,; but
had difficulty in winning the return
engagement, 20-19. The Wooster
games were also examples in that
Wup lost the ﬁrst game, 30-11, but
won the return engagement, 36-28.

a reputation at the time and Wup
was fortunate in scheduling them

'The boys from the eastern part of

the state won that game, 21-12, but
Wup showed promise of future de-
velopment.

Discontinue Sport

Basketball was discontinued as a
sport here during 1908-1909, and
the early part of 1910; but it was
revived near the close of the year.
Wup had given way ‘by that time
to the University of Pittsburgh, and
the athletic reputation of the school
rapidly gained headway.

Beginning with the season of
1910-1911, there have been but two
seasons in which Pitt did not W111
at least as many games as it lost
Those two seasons were in 1917-
1918 when the war interfered great‘
lywith the sport and in 1924-1925.
three years before Hyatt, Reed.
Stash Wrolbleski, Zehfuss and Wun-

Local fans know little about the
success of Pitt’s basketball teams
previous to that of the 1927-1928
season, but three teams made envi-
able records before that time. The

1914-1915, 1915-1916, and 1925-
1926 teams all made good marks-

It is well to note here that Pitt’s
success in basketball_ has been
synonymous with that in football.
From1914 to 1918, Pitt enjoyed its
longest stretch of football victories;
while in 1925, “Horse” C-base led
the football team to an eastern
championship, even though it lost to
Lafayette early in the year, by cli-
maxing the camp-9-l'8‘n with a 14-0
triumph over Penn at Franklin
Field.
