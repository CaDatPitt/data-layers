By JIM HUFNAGEL

Reverend J. H. Madden is
an official associate minister
of Payne Chapel, A.M.E.
Church, Duquesne, but he has
a much larger, unoﬁicial con-
gregation—the entire student
body of the University.

To a largeipart of his unofficial
congregation who are busy hur-
rying to and from classes in the
Cathedral, he is known simply

as the “preacher” or “the man
who sells peanuts.”

Any one of the many who do
stop to talk with him ﬁnd out,
however, that he has much more
to offer than peanuts.

‘Hospitality Pays’

“Hospitality pays dividends”
has been Reverend Madden’s phil-
osophy throughout his long and
active career.

Born in Mount Arcy, North
Carolina, in 1896, the Reverend
preached in Alabama, Kentucky,
Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and
West Virginia before he arrived
in Pittsburgh in 1938.

A year after his arrival here
he was ordained a minister and
in 1946 an Elder of the old
Bethe] Church on Larimer Ave-
nue. He has also been honored
as an Evangelical Preacher of
the Pittsburgh Annual Confer-
ence and has recently been in-
vited to speak in Washington,
D. C.

Speaking of his wares, which he
also vends at Dormont High
School football games, Pirate games
and Panther football. games, Rev-

erend Madden says, “Peanuts are __
the best product nature ever pro- ‘

duced. According to the late Dr.
George Washington Carver, there

are 150 ingredients in every pea-

nut.”
Whether he purchases a bag of

‘peanuts or not, anyone who is
is entitled to a few.

interested
of the Reverend's philosophical
thoughts.

For example, “the first fac-
ulty of the mind is judgment.
There are two contexts in life
--bogus and sincerity. What

._ distinguishes them is that one

is hypocritical and the other
genuine.’

“When we think of any founda-
tiops, the Roman Empire, for in--
stance, which have dominated the
world, we realize that any coun-
try that exalts itself against God
has fallen back to heathenism.
All natural kingdoms will event-
ually fall. The only ete.rnalking-
dam is the kingdom of God, in
this world and in the world to
come.”

Concerning racial discrimina-
tion, Reverend Madden observed,

of Adam. Therefore, there should

Review Programs For Week

Mrs. Davitt S. Bell, active in educational and civic or-
ganizations, will review “The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich” by William L. Shirer today at 4:15 p.m. in the Fine
Books Room of the Book Center.

Slated for next Friday in the Book Review Series is

Moshe

Shamir, Israeli literary ﬁgure, who will discuss

“Writers Old and_ Young in Is-V‘-

rael.”

“The Rise’ and Fall of the Third
Reich,” the complete story of Hit-
1er’s empire, was cited as the
November, 1960 selection of the
Book-of-—th—Month—Club'.

Shirer wrote this book from
information which he gathered
after watching and reporting on
the Nazis since 1925. The book
reveals Hitler’s loves,’ imprison-
ment and his suicide. It also con-
tains hundreds of inside stories
about the war which were found
in the Nazi files after the un-
conditional surrender of Germany.

Shamir’s visit to the Univer-
sity is a part of his three-month
lecture tour of the United States.
Through his short stories, plays,
and novels, Shamir has been ac-
claimed as one of the most im-
portant literary spokesmen of
the Sabra (native born) genera-
tion of Israel.

Author of seven novels, he is
best known in this country for
“King of Flesh and Blood,” for
which he was awarded the Bialik
Prize in 1955. The book has been
translated into four languages.

Shamir, 50, is the son of an
American bacteriologist. A f t e r
graduating from high school, he
joined a kibbutz. (Similar to a

He later became a member of
the Haganah, the Jewish settlers’
defense corps, and in 1943 joined
the Palmach, famed Commando
Corps of Israel’s Army.

Towards the end of World War
II, when the British Mandate was
in existence, Shamir wrote many
of the famous “illegal” pamphlets
which constituted the only news-
papers in Israel at that time.

This is not the first time that
Shamir has visited the United
States. Under a Rockefeller
Foundation grant, he touredand
studied the American non-
Broadway theater movement
and lectured on’ contemporary
Hebrew. 1‘

In addition to his writing, Sha-
mir teaches drama at Tel Aviv

on the Central Committee on the

Council for Culture and the Arts,
and the Hebrew Academy.

 Hervey Allen Collection
HoldsWorks of Alumnus

By PAUL WILSON
In 1933, a graduate of the University gave the histor-
ical novel a rebirth in America with a picturesque romance
that sold over a million and a half copies in 19 different
languages. That book ‘was “Anthony. Adverse” and its au-

thor was Hervey’ Allen.
Hervey Allen grew -up

shadyside Academy. In 1913, heO

was appointed to the United
States Naval Academy at Anna-
polis. ‘

Because of an athletic injury,
however, he was honorably dis-
charged and came to the Uni-
V91-sity. He graduated with a B.S.
in economics and a Phi Beta Kap-

_ pa key in 1915.

Fought in War
In World War I, he was a First
Lieutenant of Infantry and was
twice wounded. Before returning
to America, he taught English in
the French Military Mission at
Favernay. .
Allen went to Charleston, S.C.
in 1919 and founded the Poetical
Society of South Carolina in col-
laboration with DuBois Hey-
ward. He took two years of
graduate work at Harvard and
then taught English for two
‘years at the Charleston high
school and for a year at Colum-
bia University.
He moved on to Vassar and,

0 while instructing American liter-

ature there, met a pretty sopho-
more named Ann Hyde Andrews.
In 1927 they were married.
‘Famous Biography

Allen was also a prolific poet
and historian. His war ballad,
“The Blindma‘n,” gave its name to
the Blindman Prize for Poetry
which the Poetry Society of South
Carolina offered for five _years.
His biography of Poe, “Israfel,”
shares a place with those by Jos-

in Pittsburgh and attended

eph Wood Krutch and Arthur
Hobson Quinn.

“Anthony Adverse,” however,
was the turning point of Allen’s
life. It brought him world fame
and, as one critic put it, was
“America’s most original contri-
bution, certainly, its longest;
perhaps indeed it." only contri-
bution to the great tradition of
the picaresque novel.”

“Anthony Adverse” described
the world ——- wide wanderings of
a young adventurer during the
Napoleonic period. It was made
into a motion picture by Warner
Brothers in 1936.

. Obtains Collection

Hervey Allenidied in 1949 and,
in 1952, the University purchased
his writings from his widow.
These are now housed in the
Hervey Allen Room on the fourth
floor, Cl. '

There areymore than 22,000
letters and over 2,000 boks that
he either wrote or used in his
immense reference work for his
story backgrounds.

In addition, there are a huge
chest containing his war uniforms
and manuscripts, a khaki bound
book he used in France, an ori-
ginal plate of “Anthony Adverse,”
an honorary Doctor of Letters de-
gree from the University, and a
collection of autographed editions
by authors such as Robert Frost,
DuBois Heyward, Stephen Vin-
cent Benet, and Amy Lowell.

Wilson College
Choir Schedules
Concert Friday

The Wilson College Choir, un-
der the direction of Robert Kings-
bury, will perform this Friday at
8:30 p.m. in the Heinz Chapel. The
choir consists of 30 girls from Wil-
s3n College in Chambersburg,
Penna.

The University’s Men’s Glee

"Club will also participate in the

program. There will be no ad-
mission charge for the perform-
ance. ‘

Prior to the program, the choir
will be guests at a dinner in the
Vira Heinz Room, 12th floor C1.

The dinner is being prepared by’ 9

members of the Glee Club with
the assistance of the Dean of Wo-
me’n’s staff.

Commenting on the dinner, Dr.
David Weiss, director of the Glee
Club, said, “This is a unique ev-
ent since we are the only glee
club in the nation who prepares
the food themselves to serve to
the visiting groups.”

Rhapsody which will be sung by
the Glee Club. Jane Stevenson,
a member of the Wilson choir, will
be soloist.

tThe Missle Capt i '

By Dan Johnson ,
For those seeking publicity,
the ambiguous expression

“missile gap” is extremely‘ useful.

A It is undeﬁned and can mean
_/‘many things.

A Before we can turn to the
problem —— is "
there a “mis- V
siletgap?” --
we must de-
fine’. our term.

i Manypeople
consider “mis-
sile gap” to
me a n i t h e
number of

‘ Soviet mis-
siles , com'pared .
to the number .

the United States possesses. Un-
I official sources, supposedly I911‘
’ ‘able, estimate the Soviets have

about 70 ICBM missiles and the

United States 12. or these, the

Soviets have about 45 ready to
'« go; of ours only two are ready
‘to ﬁre in a 15 minute period.

The United Statesalso has two
‘Polaris ‘missile subs and some

i’ I . IRBM bases in England, but the

Soviets outnumber us in ready-
to-ﬁre missiles about three to
two. (If our IRBM’s and
ICBM’s are counted together.)
‘I~I’ere,i“there truly is a “missile
 gap.”

Another way often considered
is in light of recent space
achievements of the Soviets and

 Editor's Folly

By William Benrieﬁ

, If ‘one is even slightly aware of contemporary
events and affairs, he cannot help,but notice the
presence in the. newsstandsof a small but porten-
tious book entitled “Advertisements for Myself,”_ by
Norman Mailer.

‘For those of you who imagine this early in the
game that I am about to launch
into a polemic against the-heav-
ily coincidental appearance of :-
this book with Mr.-.Mailer’s re-‘ ’
cent jaunt through the news- —
papers, read on. A’ _

Because /this entire column
has been fashioned into a small-
scale advertisement for myself,
or better, an advertisement for
“Ideas and Figures,” which I ’
the genuine and often Byzantine
pleasure to edit.

I feel justiﬁed in abusing my column space in
this manner because I am more aware than any-
body at this point that the magazine is rather on
the unknown side. (Looking over the office some
mornings, I feel forgotten by even the ubquituous
cleaning ladies.)

Funny Man ,

Therefore,'I hold some hope that those of you
who have paused to look at this column, thinki_ng
the photograph accompanying it to be an extension
of ‘Little Man on Campus,” will read on and make
“Ideas and Figures” (cheap, only ﬁfty cents) less
strange to. yourselves.
A And while we are on the subject of my photo-
graph, you‘ might, since this is a confessed com-

‘mercial, draw an oldtime carnival barker’s hat on

it, or even sketch a hand extending from what
shows of the shoulder, complete with snake oil.

Go ahead. It can serve as indirect recenge_on.my
earlier windbaggery ‘on ideologies or nazism. But
I am digressing from the product‘ at hand. '

I am faced with’ the task of turning “Ideas and
Figures into as much a campus tradition, say, as
the persistent and seadily throbbing wish that
someday some geological mishap will pitch the

this point that I am attempting the impossible; I
am inclin‘ed.to agree.

But none the same, it" would do my czarish‘

heart some small good if the next time I was ‘intro— ‘

duced in public, complete with title (the only,

thing that gets someone as disreputable as myself
into public functions), I should receive something
‘more than blank stares or looks suggesting I am
ringleader of a highly obscene secret operation.

nature, would win a new car. A quick check of

' Vermont Coed
Gives Thoughts

Editor, The Pitt News: ‘

I am sure you often wonder,
as we do, whether the papers
we send out on exchange are
ever read. I have been observ-
ing through the eyes of The Pitt
News the activities on the Pitt
campus this year, and in your
issue of February 13th I have
found something upon which I
must comment. , = '

In the article headed “Stu-
dents ‘Riots’ Against ‘Clothes
Code’ ” Mr. Bryant quotes Saga
officials to, the effect that Pitt
cafeteria clothing policy is the
most'liberalv in effect in the

schools Saga serves. Saga serves

us, too, and I must say clothing
policy could hardly be more lib-
eral than at the University of
Vermont. '

We have two separate dining’-I

rooms, one on the girls’ residen-

tial campus, and the other,on
what we refer to as Main cam-

pus, where most of our class and

administration buildings’ are__lo-

will be cut down considerably by,,e~

the advent of the sound genera-
tion missile, the minuteman.

If numbers are of the utmost
concern to (politicians, they can
continue to rant and rave about
the growing Soviet missile lead.

’ However, if retaliatory force is,

as it should be, the greatest con-
cern, then a missile gap does not
exist. ’

Screaming for publicity is the
politician prerogative, but show
~of“‘1ook, Ilcan scare more people

;ness”.., and .are att rnptng I to ,

cated. The latter dining room

serves some 700 people at each‘

meal, of which approximately
150 are girls. i

The clothing policy in the girls’
dining room “suggests” that they
wear skirts to all meals except
on Saturday, yet no mention is
ever made concerning pin curls,
hair rollers, or the wearing of
one skirt which suffices to cover
up bermudas on any occasion.
Many of the girls have such a
skirt, usually unfit for anything‘
but a ragbag. On Main campus

there are no “suggestions” what- ,

ever, and bdysand girls wear
what they like, including sweat-
shirts and jeans for both sexes.

College Sets

Expansion

.By CHRISTINE LUNDBERG
' In the typical Pennsylvania
setting of steel mills, smoke

. and. smog, is a small college

in Johnstown. Although its
buildings are not nearly as
large as the towering Cathe-

dral of Learning, the text books,
tuition, and standard of teaching
are all on an even par with the
Uni Jersity. \
Formerly called the Center,

- _Johnstown College is one part of

the University with which few
-students are acquainted.

Founded in 1927, Johnstown
College has continued to offer
the same opportunities as a Uni-
versity, yet giving individual in-
struction to its students. The in-
‘structors are regular members of
the University faculty.

Eases Transition
‘ Undergraduates at Johnstown
can complete two years of any
course offered here at the Uni-
versity. Graduate students can
"complete about half of the work
needed for a masters degree.
-9 One of the advertised ad-
vantages of Johnstown College
is that the combining of college
life with living at home makes
' the transition from high school
to college less diﬁicult. Teach-
ers know the students individ-
ually and can help them cor-
rect any diﬁiculties in adjust-

_, ing to college work.

Doris Brown, Arts Sr., who has
attended both Johnstown College
and the University, says, “Con-
ﬁary to the opinion of most Pitt
students, Johnstown College has
an active campus life. If I ever
wanted to do something, there was

always an activity going on at

the campus.”
Activities Listed

Miss Brown who was a former
president of the A.W.S. at Johns-
town, cited some of the other
school activities as the Glee Club,

Pre-med Forum, Dramatics Club,
Student Congress, Pershing Riﬂes,
Panther Cub newspaper, besides
Engineering Clubs and Bus. Ad.
Clubs.

“Because of the small size of
the college,” she continued,
“many more students have the
opportunity to develop leader-
ship in school activties.”

_ Varsity teams in basketball and
football compete in the Pa. Jr.
College Athletic League and have
won, the championship several
times.

University Theatre Announces
Auditions or New Productions

Ralph Allen of the Speech de-
partment has announced tryouts
for the next production of the
University Theater Group. Try-
outs will be held today from 2:30
p.m. to 4 p.m. in 1126 C1.

 The Theater Group will put on
‘two plays -— Chekhov’s “On the
Harmfulness of Tobacco,” and
vSynge’s “The Tinker’s Wedding."

Chekhov’s play is a one-act
comic monologue, in which a hen-
Decked gentleman, ostensibly de-

livering a temperance lecture, be-
moans the miseries of his life un-
der the thumb of his tyranical
life.

Like. Synge’s better known plays
“The Playboy of the Western
World” and “Riders to the Sea,”
“The ..Tinker’s Wedding” also
deals with life among the provin-
cial Irish.

Students interested in non act-
ing parts are also welcome.

as

 

“It‘s the note in between these two keys that I want
you to sing. The piano is ﬁat so you can’t really tell from
the note I’m giving you, but you know what note-I mean.

Sing it!”

And the Heinz Chapel Choir does sing it; and they do
know what Dr. Theodore Finney means when he says “you

know what I mean.” VVhy?

The Heinz Chapel Choir and Dr. ’

Finney, or Pop, as he is known to

choir members, are “one and the «

same thing.” Possible?
seems to think so.
'3egan in 1939

Dr. Finney started the choir in
January, 1939 when Heinz Chapel
was completed. He had been
working with a mixed chorus and

.when the need arose for a choir to
sing in the chapel, the chorus
ﬁlled the bill.

The group has grown since its
beginning into an active choir of
sixty,’ with several hundred
alumni. In addition to singing

.- in Heinz Chapel, the choir sings
for various University ‘functions,
gives concerts around the Pitts-
burgh area, and goes on a con-
cert tour every spring‘.

But the choir is more than this.
It is a group, as closely_ knit as a
fraternity or ‘sorority, whose mem-
bers trudge to 901 Cl every day
at the undesirable hour of 4 p.m.
to sing for no other reason than
because they like to sing.

Commands Respect

Aquestion which still remains to
be answered is “Why is Dr. Fin-
ney and -‘the Heinz Chapel Choir
one and the same thing?” Rochelle
Burton, choir president, said, “It

The choir

l

is hard to say anything about the
choir without talking about Pop.
“We always feel that with Pop
standing in front of us, we can
sing a.nything he wants, to the
perfection he wants. He com-
mands respect and perfection,
and we readily respond.”
Another member said that he is
always tired when he attends re-
hearsal after a full day of classes.
“All Pop has to do is say sing,
and I ﬁnd the energy to sing.”
Diversiﬁed Group
In his book “We have Made Mu-
sic” Dr. Finney expresses his
thoughts about the choir, complet-
ing the “one and the same” cycle.
“We are Christian and Jew,
Protestant and Catholic; we are
English, or Greek, or German,
or Italian, or French, or any-
thing else that happens. VVe are
brilliant and average, homely or
not quite so homely, second or
thirteenth generation American.
“We have money or we don’t
have, we are fraternity ..or inde-
pendent . . . We are tall or short,
dark or light. These do not mat-
ter: ‘color of skin, political party,
social and national and religious
and cultural backgrounds-——none
of these things matter in the least.
“We have made music.”

Students To Help
Clothijiig Code
With Cooperation

Voluntary student cooperation
earmarks the enforcement of the
recently formulated clothing code,"
which takes effect today. ,

The Schenley cafeteria will be‘
the only ppatroled area. Joseph‘
Hedges, campus proctor, will re-
fuse.._admittance to violators. Com-,
plaints concerning dress in the
cafeteria prompted certain stu-
dent leaders to devise. the ruling.

In other areas of the University,
such as the library and class-
rooms, students are “asked to co-
operate through their own voli-
lion, and respect the new regula-
tions.

Letters have been sent to the.

faculty andlibrary staff request-
ing their support in encouraging
students to observe this code. ‘
Printed cards have been placed
on the tables in the cafeteria to
remind students of the code.

Students, feels “The Code is cer-
tainly a reasonable one, and one
which any University "student
should be willing to uphold.”

Tumbling, Free Exercise Titles

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Navy will be theihosts this weekend for the 34th ms-
- nual Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League individual

championships. The tourney,

year, will be open to all member institutions of the East-

ern College Athletic Conferenc

Championships will be achieved in the six standard

events: tumbling, side horse, hori-O
zontal bar, hope climb, parallel
bars and flying rings -4-’ plus‘the
olympic All-Around. The Olympic
section includes free exercise,
1ong horse vault, side horse, still
rings, horizontal bar and parallel
bars.

As in the past, only individual
titlists will be determined, but
the competition is open to all
ECAC members. Comprising the
six—team EIGL are Navy, Penn
State, Army, Syracuse, Temple
and Pitt. Navy was first in league
play with a 5-0 record. —

Medals Awarded

Medals will be awardedto the
ﬁrst four place winners in each
event and there will be trophies
for the All—Around leaders also.
Navy also will receive its trophy
for capturing the EIGL team
championship much to the delight
of their home gym fans.

Competition gets underway at

7:30. p.m. on Friday and con-

cludes with ar afternoon session

on Saturday starting at 1:30.

Thus, the two-day plan places

the emphasis on the ‘ﬁnals when

only eight contestants will com-
pete for the individual titles.

Besides the six members of the
EIGL other schools that will send
entries are Springﬁeld, West Vir-
ginia and Massachusetts. Three
judges will be employed for each
preliminary event on Friday while
ﬁve officials are used for the ﬁnal

or lowest judges’ score counting
in the ﬁnal tabulation.
Hotly Contested
Th e All-Around competition
ﬁgures to be a hotly contested af-
fair between Greg Weiss and Tom
Seward, both of Penn State, and
Springﬁeld’s Jeff Cardinali. Weiss
just did edge Cardifiali last year
at Temple, 539-533, to gain this
honored title. .
Other strong entries in this
rugged event that could ﬁnish
in the top five include Bob Smith
of Temple, Syracuse’s Ray Lein-
inger and the Panthers’ only en-
trant here, Ed Zamecnik. _
Tumbling figures’ to be a tight
battle between the Panthers’ Earl
McConnell and Navy’s Joe Marsh-
all, the defending champion.
Three others have a great chance
to take it all and this trio in-

tilio and Phil Voas, of Syracuse.
Main Choices

Cardinali was runnerup . to
Penn State’s Lee Cunninghampon
the side Horse last year, but must
ﬁght it out this season with Weiss,
Seward, Leininger, Army’s Ralph
Garens and Joe Maiden and Bruce
Krueger, both of Navy, for the
title.

Seward and Weiss appear to
be the main choices to win the
horizontal or high bar, but if
they shouldn’t hit their routines
they could be adged out by
either Cardinali, Smith ,Krue-
ger, Zamecnik, the Panthers’,
Jack Rainaldi and Merle Wil-
liams of Army.

P The grapplers had a greater
upset pinned on them Saturday
at Penn State. The Blue and Gold
were fresh from a surprise vic-
tory over powerful Lehigh and
were favored to beat the Lions.

But the Lions were strong
where the Panthers were not
and managed to pull out a 17-12
triumph. *

Perhaps the Panthers ﬁrst loss
was an omen of things to come.
The defeat to Michigan on Jan. 16,
couldn’t be considered an upset
since the match was supposed to
be a toss-up. i

However, the ease with which
the Wolverines handled the Cats
was a surprise. They crushed
the Blue and Gold 22-6 and while
doing so handed senior Larry
Lauchle the first dual meet loss
of his collegiate career. This may
have been the biggest upset of
the year.

In that meet Daryl Kelving-
ton and Jim Harrison also tasted
defeat for the first time.

But all was not gloom for the
matmen. They defeated Cornell,
Syracuse, Northwestern, Michigan
State, Maryland, and Lehigh. The

year.

Basketball Seen
As Minor Sport
At University

By TED COLTQN
Sports Editor

IIllllIlllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

 

With the ’60-61 basketball season over it appears that everybody
in the athletic department is well satisﬁed with the 12-11 record
which our roundball heros have accumulated. Nobody seems to care
that for the last two years the Panther cagers have »been below the
.500 mark even whenthey had an all-American.

Basketball at Pitt is in a shameful state. It seems that the whole
school has an “I don't give a hoot” attitude. A school the size of Pitt
should be able to put out a basketball team that is always among the
top 25 teams in the nation and with the schedule they play, Pitt shoul
never be below the. .500 mark. »
p A 12-11 record with such teams as Carnegie Tech, Westminster,
Bucknell, and Brown on the schedule the Panthers surely should
have spouted a better record than they did. '

It appears that the main basketball problem besides not car-
ing, is the lack of an adequate recruiting system. Just take a‘
look at the past couple of years. I

Here are the names of five hoopers who received scholarships in
’58. Bob Sankey, Ken Hepworth, Joe Schnitzki, John Moore and Bob
Sigel. Of the ﬁve only Sankey has been of any help to the team this
year.

Of the five starters this year John Fridley, Ben Jinks and Don
Steinhart came here on full basketball scholarships. Dick Falenski
came to Pitt on a tiution-only scholarship and his father had to
threaten to withdraw him from school in order to get full aid.

Tom Maloney paid his own way to Pitt the first semester
but got aid after that. And Jinks was recruited by Vic Fusia,
former football coach. I
\ Here are some more examples: Bill Mauro, last year’s co—cap—

tain, came to Pitt on his own and received aid after he got here.
Howard Lockhart and Darwin Smith came to Pitt without Coach Bob
Timmons ever seeing them play. He heard a play by play broadcast
of one of their high school games on the radio when the Panthers
were in Kentucky. Jim Foley got a scholarship after performing ad-

  

 

 

 

 

 

v mirably in Pitt’s IM league.

Here comeslthe best of all; Julius Pegues,‘fourth highest scorer
in Pitt’s history and one of the best all—around players ever to per-
form at Pitt, came here on his own with an academic scholarship and
decided to go out for basketball. And Pitt’s great All-American Don
Hennon was never contacted by a Pitt coach. Instead, he had to
Come down to the University to see if he’ could get a scholarship.

After’ seeing these examples I guess the University is lucky
to have done as well as they have in the past years.

Another interesting sideline is that Diidey Moore, former Du-
pruesne and presently LaSalle basketball tutor, wanted the Pitt coach-
ing job back in 1953 but Pitt turned him down. I wonder why?

This all adds up to one thing.

The athletic department does not

care if they have a winning basketball team or not. Now, is this fair
to the school, the students or even the players themselves‘?

V With a lot more effort and a little more money Pitt could become
a top-notch basketball school. And it’s about time somebody started

caring about the roundball sport.

On Line Against Notre Dame

Irish Swim Meet
Completes Season

By JOHN FLEMING

This week the Mermen
prepare to meet another
tough competitor in the Irish
of Notre Dame. The Aquatic
Cats will place their three
game winning streak on ‘the
line when these two teams clash

at the Tech pool, Saturday at
8:00 p.m. ”
The Mermen and the Irish

have met in the water only once
before and the lrishmen came out
with a lopsided 66-29 victory.
The Panthers feel conﬁdent that
such a thing will not occur this
year.
Leading Irish

the swimming

- aces are backstroker Bob Grevar

and sprinter Jim Cronin. Both
of these boys swam against the
Panthers last year and left their
mark in the mind of Coach Grady.
Brother Combination
The Irish will also bring with
them a brother combination in
Don and George Whicthgsr. Don
takes part in the medley races
while George is a standout in the
freestyle events. ‘
There are also a number of
newcomers to the varsity squad
this year for the Irish who are
shaping up into top swimmers.
Sophomores Tom (lark, John
Vasu, and Jack McCloud seem
"to have added to the team what
was missing after graduation.
Both the Irish and the Pan,-
thers have lost to Ohio Univer-
sity and almost by identical
scores. This meet will no doubt
be as closeas the Syracuse match
which went down’ to the last re-

lay before the winner was de-
cided.

Top Competition ‘

All of Notre Dame’s power

doe.sn’t scare the Panthers, how-
ever. The Mermen are used to
meeting top competition and
coming out victorious. ‘
Of the ﬁve victories to the
Panthers’ credit, four wins have
been over conference champions

Crapplinvr John. Zolilcojf One of ‘Mighty Mites’

Eastern Champ to Defend Title

By BOB SMIZIK

The senior member
(weightwise) of the Panthers’
famed “mighty mites” is a
powerfully built, black haired
junior from Erie, who goes
by the name, of John Zolikoil.

iWhen the Blue and Gold com-
pete in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Association Champion-

ships, March 10-11, John will lay '

his 147 pound title on the line.
Last year his surprising win was
one of the reasons the Cats tied
Penn State for the title.

John will face two problems in
defending his title. Of course, as
returning champion he will be the
man that everyone will be point-
ing for. The second problem‘the
Panther ace will have to face may
not seem as serious as the first,
but could prove to be just as
troublesome.

Mad Students

This year the Easterns are be-
ing held at Lehigh University.
As a result of their tremendous
upset over Lehigh, the Panthers

.are about as popular there as

0

Saturday classes are -at this in-

> stitution.

The wrestling mad students
of Lehigh are not about to let
the boys from Skyscraper U.
forget that they spoiled a per-
fect season for their grapplers.
The crowd, which comes all the
way up to the edge of the mat,
will be hurling taunts at Zoli-
koﬂ‘, no matter who he is-
wrestling.

Of more worry to John, how-
ever, will be his opponents. As
he puts it, “the competition is so
tough that if I win, it will be an
upset even though I’m defending
champion.” But don’t get John
wrong. One thing he doesn’t lack
is confidence. “I am just as sure
that I’ll win as I’m sure that I’ll
be an underdog,” explained the
147 pounder.

Expects Trouble _

Zolikoff expects trouble from
Mike Natv_ig and Bob Gifnst in his
quest to repeat last year’s ‘per-
formance. Natvig, of Army, is the
only man to defeat John in acol-
legiate dual meet. .

“These two boys will probably

think I can beat them out,”
A Zolikoﬂ proclaimed.

Zolikoff did not hesitate to give
all credit for his success to Coach
Rex Peery_ .“You can’t be good
