David Birnbaum knows what it's like
to live with uncertainty. L

When asked last semester how many
professors he would have to work with in
the upcoming, year, the chair of Pitt’s
Slavic Languages and Literatures
Department could only shrug his shoul-
ders, smile and defer the question to uni-
versity administrators.

As to the number of teaching assis-
tants in the department? He couldn’t
answer that one either.

What about the class offerings in the
Slavic department next semester? Well,
the answer to that was sort of on hold.

Last year, Birnbaum became used to
people not having the answers. He
became used to people telling him that the

cutbacks
Piﬂ chairs

status of his academic department within
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was unre-
solved. He becarne used to a general lack
of information.

With Pitt scrambling to overcome dif-
ficult challenges facing higher education
while trying to maintain its national stand-
ing, academic programs have been affect-
ed.

"The essence of the academic restruc-
turing is the cutbacks," Birnbaum said. "It
is not impossible that a university may
have a program that is not very good. The
problem lies in the fact that there is no
black and white. The challenge is to do as
little damage as possible."

As a result of budgetary constraints
stemming from limited money coming
into Pitt's coffers, Pitt administrators made
some tough decisions involving decreases

It is not even a good

For The Pitt News

In a recent study, nearly six out of
seven students say their professors give
much or some attention to their needs.
In addition, almost four out of ﬁve stu-
dents said they were satisﬁed with their
teachers.

Near the conclusion of each semes-
ter, ofﬁcial surveys are distributed to
practically every class for students to
rate their professors’ teaching. These
surveys then disappear into departments
and ﬁles, and we are never able to hear
the results.

To inform Pitt students of what
these results might be, 200 undergradu-
ate CAS students were asked to rate
their professors’ teaching: are they cov-
ering the matcrial, do
they respond to the stu-
dents’ needs, what
methods do they
employ, and is their.
teaching effective?

The results con-
cluded that 100 percent
of students feel their
professors this semes-
ter are covering their
course material.
Furthermore, 86 per-
cent of students say
their professors give
much or some time and
attention to students’
needs.

Regarding how
Pitt professors com-
pare to other universi-
ties, in terms of
addressing the students’ need, transfer
student‘ Erin Manns gave insight by
comparing Pitt to her previous universi-
ty, Duquesne University. 1

“As a transfer student, I am
impressed with the effectiveness of
most of my professors here at Pitt," she
said. "Some are very interactive with
their students and appear to be genuine-
ly interested in the students’ learning of
the material.”

The survey also questioned the
method Pitt’s professors employ in their
courses. The poll showed 58 percent of
teachers were structuring their courses
around the content material (what stu-
dents expect to learn in a particular
class), and 20 percent of professors
were said to structure their classroom
around their ﬁeld of expertise.

The ﬁnal section of the survey
reﬂected the students’ overall satisfac-
tion with Pitt professors and the stu-
dents’ assessment of the professors’
teaching. In the end, 78 percent of stu-
dents claimed they are either satisﬁed or
content with their professors‘ teaching

style and 57 percent found their profes-
sors’ as effective.

The survey seemed to exhibit that
students are satisfied with the teaching
of their professors. Although a general
assessment of Pitt professors was taken,
specific professors or departments were
not “graded” in this survey.

Many of the students who complet-
ed the survey expresscd their judgment
of Pitt professors. Maria, a junior who
wished to remain anonymous, included
in her comments, “Teachers for the most
part at Pitt are either really good or real-
ly poor. A lot of them are just going
through the motions year after year with
the same tests, lectures, etc. They lost
their passion for their work and we suf-
fer from it.”

David Brumble, the associate dean

‘ of CAS undergraduate
students, addressed
students like Maria
who are unhappy with
certain professors.

“If a student is
having problems with
any of their professors,
they should immedi-
ately talk to the
teacher, and if they feel
uncomfortable doing
this, I would urge them
to talk to the depart-
ment chair," he said.

. "They can also
write a letter [to the
department chair] and
if other students feel
the same way, have
them sign the letter,"
— he added. "The quality
of the teaching is of very much concern
to the department chair. If there are
problems, they want to know. That is a
very important part of their job. Another

’ possibility is the student can also write a

letter to the dean of the school.”

As Pitt students approach the end of
the semester, stress and last-minute
cramming swamp the entire campus,
students ﬂood the library, and wait to
see what their ﬁnal grades will be.

In the meantime, while students
reﬂect on how well their professors
have taught them this semester, they can
“grade them” immediately with the sur-
veys distributed in class. Those surveys
will be given to the individual profes-
sors after ﬁnal grades are in, and the
professors are obligated to later hand
them over to their respective depart-
ments.

If personal matters arise between
students and professors, which was con-
ﬁrmed to be an issue discovered in this
survey, advising and staff urge all stu-
dents to ﬁnd the correct faculty member
and speak up.

DEAN

in faculty members, teaching assistants,
and academic departments to refocus
spending and get more bang for the buck.

Slavics wasn’t the only department
feeling the squeeze. Many others were in
the same position.

“I feel we [the Department of
Geology and Planetary Sciences] clearly
demonstrated our viability as an academic
department,” said Tom Anderson, geology
and planetary science chair. “By being on
the list of programs being
looked at, it screws us all
up. It is not very good
management.”

So, as Pitt looks to
trim the fat without affect-
ing its academic reputa-
tion, the search continues
for the new FAS dean.

And campus-wide
department and program
chairs are interested to see
not only what comes out
of the selection process,
but also what lies in store
for the futures of their
respective departments.

Small departments are . .
frightened about severe cutbacks to their
staff and budget, and large departments
about a lack of funding to keep them com-
petitive nationally.

"The new deanis going to have to
deal with the ﬁnancial problems of the
University from the outset," Frank
Tabakin, physics and astronomy chair,
said. "In part, this is being able to have a
budget that maintains the standing of the
University in both teaching and research.

"Certainly this is the No. 1 concern
because so much ﬂows from it," he said.
"If ﬁnances are on a ﬁrm and good basis,
this serves the community with respect to
the economy, it serves the educational
needs of the University and it gets the best
professors to come here."

Academic chairs such as Edward
Muller of the history department feel the
dean "is going to be taking over during a
time when University resources are
extremely tight."

"You look for the best possible leader
in FAS at this difficult time, someone with
a fairly clear vision of what FAS should
become and how we should get there,"

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1

Muller said. "This dean is going to have to
learn FAS very quickly."

And because of this pressure on the
incoming dean to learn the ropes of Pitt's
system in record time, many chairs are
curious to see where the dean will come
from.

"Pitt would take a positive step in hir-
ing a new clean from outside the
University," said Mary Louise Gill, chair
of Pitt's classics department. "We need
someone to bring new
ideas to Pitt and to foster
an atmosphere of cooper-
ation between divisions
and departments in FAS."

Calling the hiring of a
new dean a crucial event
in the University's history,
linguistics chair Daniel
Everett said he, too, was
hopeful the incoming
dean would be an external

''I feel pretty strongly
that after what the
University has been
through, the new FAS
. .. dean should come in with
no allegiance to anyone for being hired,"
he said. "There should be no excess bag-
gage."

Out of the six candidates remaining in
the dean search, one hails from Pitt and
the other ﬁve from outside the University.

Some chairs openly criticized current
FAS Dean Peter Koehler's policy of pre-
maturely capping the number of admitted
students while hiring more faculty mem-
bers.

They said the policy resulted in a
ﬁnancial ﬁasco from which Pitt is still
struggling to recover.

"We are in disarray," Anderson said.
"In tenns of providing resources to stu-
dents and enhancing the prestige of the
University, we just haven't gotten that
done.

"The incoming dean needs to lead the
faculty. This seems to happen at Penn
State and CMU, but we seem to be so
slow on our feet," Anderson said. "We
have very good people and we should use
them. Pitt has a huge lack of self-conﬁ-
dence. We shouldn't be afraid to go out
and get quality students."

LANDLORDS

essary precautions, like documentation, to
protect themselves.

Many students like Bryan Gropper Ben
Schneider, and Anita Peduzzi complain that
landlords just don’t return security deposits.
And when they are returned, the amount is
often a fraction of the original deposit.

On the ﬂip side, though, many land-
11 wrds like Joseph Deluliis, M.J. Kelly Realty,
and John C.R. Kelly often believe they are
quite fair in returning deposits.

Bryan Gropper disagrees, however.

He says he didn’t get an appropriate
return on his security deposit Among the
deductions, said the senior psychology
major, were $50 to paint one room and $166
to have a stove knob ﬁxed.

Gropper said that the room that was
painted needed only a touch-up; landlord
Joseph Deluliis disagreed.

Of the $50 paint job, Deluliis said the
tenants "painted frat letters in one of the attic
rooms. Nice, big ﬁve—foot-tall letters that

'won’t come olf with one coat of paint.”

But more puzzling to Gropper was the
$166 charge for a damaged stove knob.

Deluliis said the pricey charge arose
because “we had to call someone in to ﬁx
ﬂiat.”

Gropper says that he was even more
perturbed to discover that the knob had not

A been ﬁxed when he went back to the apart-

ment to pick up any nonforwarded mail. The
new tenants had moved in, but the stove
knob was not ﬁxed.

Deluliis said the repair had not yet been

   

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1 '

made because he was waiting 30 days so the
withheld security deposit could be spent
legally. '

Hopkins, of the HRC, says he knows of
no such law on the books that stipulates a
waiting period for repairs.

The “Guide to the Lease Agreement,” a
booklet available at the HRC, which is locat-
ed at 127 North Belleﬁeld Ave., recom-
mends, “When you enter into a lease agree-
ment, make a complete list of all damages
(even the most minor damages) and submit
this to your landlord. Make sure you keep a
copy for your records. The landlord must

agree to the speciﬁcs of the damage list. If '

you don’t make a list, you run the risk of
eventually being charged for that which you
did not do.”

Hopkins also recommends taking pic-
tures of any damages noticed when moving
into the apartment and having the landlord
sign and date the photos. That way, if the
landlord never gets around to ﬁxing the

‘ problems, he or she can't blame the tenant

for the damages and deduct the costs from
the security deposit An even better option
may be to videotape the apartment and have

the landlord approve the tape, according to

Hopkins.

Proper documentation may have

cheated out of his security deposit The
senior said that M.J. Kelly Realty deducted
approximately $300. from a $715 security
deposit. ’

Hopkins suggests taking photos of damaged appliances and fixtures.

ridiculous because when he and his room-
mates moved in, they went room to room

with an MJ. Kelly employee and docu-.

mentedtherepairsthatneededtobernade.
But he says that when the employee left the
Kelly ﬁrm while Schneider was living in the
apartment, the employee took the list with
him.

The tenants requested that the list be
copied and sent to them, and the employee
promised that all the repairs would be made.

But, according to Schneider, the copy
was never sent, and most of the repairs,
which include replacing a rotten bathroom
ﬂoor, drafty windows and an apartment full
of “nasty, disgusting carpeting,” were never
made in the two years they lived there.

He also claims that MJ. Kelly deduct-
ed from his security deposit the cost of
repairing some of the very things noted on
the original damage list.

But his landlord, Mike Kelly, says he
knows of no such list, and Schneider has no
proof. ~
Kelly said in response to Schneiders
claims of unfair deductions, "I understand
normal wear and tear, but when there are
actual damages, 1 have to charge them for it.
They had a dog that urinated on the carpet.
It would be hard for the next tenants to live
is a place that reeked of pet urine."

Kelly also thinks Schneider and his
roommates may have gotten back more than
they deserved. ’

"There was a lot more that I let them
slide on," said Kelly.

Kelly said the tenants damaged the roof
by hanging out on top of it and by dragging
a baby pool and chairs onto it. He also said
that although they were late paying their rent
11 out of 12 times, he only charged them for
four months worth of late charges.

The I-[RC recommends that students
make sure there is a clause in the lease that
says the tenant and landlord will go through
and inspect the apartment together on move-
in day. This means writing something like,
"Payment of rent subject to the repair of . . ."

, directly on the lease. Keep in mind that both

tenant and landlord must agree to this clause.
Note the condition of everything from

kitchen appliances to windows to carpeting

to any furniture provided when moving in.

According to Hopkins, the apartment
should be clean and made ready for the ten-
ants. Also, one should leave an apartment in
the condition in which it was found..

This is risky,.however. If an apartment
is found messy and stays that way, a land-
lord might deduct cleaning costs from the
security deposit anyway. Again, documenta-
tion is the only way to protect one's security
deposit.

' Tradition dictates that the apartment
should be relatively clean when a new lease
starts and the tenant is ready to move in.
Although there are no written standards
explaining just how clean "clean" is, some-
times it's downright dirty.

Anita Peduzzi said her apartment was
"absolutely atrocious" and a "pigsty" when
she moved in.

Peduzzi said the former tenants may
have defrosted the reﬁigerator and let it drip
onto the already ﬁlthy ﬂoor, creating a mess
that she was left to clean up. '

But because Peduzzi moved before her
lease oﬁicially started, it was not her land-
lord's responsibility to ensure the apart-
ment's cleanliness.

Like many landlords who rent to stu-
dents in this area, John C.R. Kelly Reality
permits students to move in before the lease
goes into effect (usually Sept. 1) if they
assume responsibility for the bulk of the
cleaning.

The landlord, in return, allows them to
move in a few days early, without charging
them extra rent.

John C.R. Kelly says that his company
does clean apartments, but there is not
enough time to clean the apartment if stu-
dents move in early.

"In lieu of sending in a cleaning crew,
we let them move in a few days early," said
Kelly. '

Tenants who occupy their John C.R.
Kelly apartments early sign a document
assuming responsibility for cleaning the
apartment.

"If the tenant says, ‘I need the apartment
before the lease starts,‘ and the landlord says,
‘You can have it, but I won't be able to get in
and clean it,’ and the tenant wants to move in
early anyway, the tenant has freed the land-
lord from his obligations," Hopkins said.

Technology, noflaw
can protect kids from
Internet pornography

Legal initiatives will never be effective at
protecting children from pornography on the
Internet. Protecting children from pornography is
the sole responsibility of parents.

Not everybody seems willing to accept this
fact, though. A summit will soon convene in
Washington at which online—industry leaders will
discuss the technologies that allow parents to
censor pornographic Internet material from their
children (e.g., Net Nanny software). They will
discuss how to develop these technologies, and
how to educate parents about how to use them.

But these technologies are receiving a lot of
criticism from people who claim they are either
ineffective or too effective. Either some porno-
graphic material slips through, or the softwares
block access to some Internet sites which contain
no offensive material whatsoever.

These opponents must be pretty shortsighted.

This summit is supposed to help developers
improve their software, so that these objections
can be dealt with.

Opponents of these technologies would rather
have laws created to clean up the Internet.

First of all, attempts at such legislation have
already failed —— take President Clinton’s pro-
posed Communications Decency Act, for exam-
ple, which the Supreme Court shot down because
it violated the free speech rights of adults.

But even if such a law were to be passed, it
could never be totally effective, because the
Internet is not confined to the United States’
jurisdiction. No law ever passed by our Congress
will have any effect on what a Web server in
France, Russia or Paraguay is allowed to offer to
Internet users.

Clearly, we have to work from two assump-
tions: Children should be protected from porno-
graphic material, and free speech rights of adults
must be upheld.

If we believe these basic axioms, then devel-
oping and improving technologies that allow par-
ents to decide what their children should have
access to, and educating parents about how to use
such technologies is the only reasonable course
of action.

as a change, I’d like to introduce you

Well, my hometown, the little
village known to many as Bradford,

deer season by shutting down every-
thing but the U.S. Post Oﬂice

Positioning Satellite, heat—sensing

hunting. Let the deer of northwest-
ern Pennsylvania beware: my town

has —— and is prepared to use 4- the
same technology on them that U.S.
joint forces used on the Iraqis.

What’s even better, is that we
have a tradition called “spottin’.”
There’s not a whole lot to the art of
spottin’, really. All you need is a
pickup truck (a friend’s or second
cousin’s will suffice), a case of
Busch or Schlitz beer, a 1 trillion-

four guys with guns. The whole idea

light out a window; look for any-
thing that reﬂects in the light
(because deer eyes reﬂect light, you
know); and shoot at it without run-
ning into the long arm of the law.

Even if you do get caught, you
can usually get off and just be a six-
pack or so shorter than before.

The week of Thanksgiving
turns my town into nothing short of
the happy hunting grounds of war-
tom Sarajevo. Mailboxes, driveway
reﬂectors, parked cars —- almost
anything is fair game. It’s pretty neat
to see your neighbor’s car engulfed
in a ball of ﬂames and hear

Though this hasn’t received
nationwide coverage, we have a
problem in my neck of the woods.
We are facing the ﬁrst ever, fully-
organized deer militia assault on
human civilization. The deer popu-
lation of Pennsylvania (and south-
westem New York, mind you) has
reached the point where seeing
Uncle Buck strapped to the ﬁcnt of
a pickup just isn’t funny anymore.

This is the very reason that I, a

Government of the business, by the business and for the business

John
Lacny

. During the past two weeks, we’ve all
had the pleasure of watching establishment
ﬁgures and their media apologists throwing

temper tantrums and shaking their ﬁsts in.

paranoid rage. You win some and you lose
some, but on our side we’ve grown accus-
tomed to losing —— so when we do win, it’s

always cause for a little smug self-satisfac-.

tron. .

We won on “fast track” Or at least,
we’ve won for the time being, and for that
we deserve to pat ourselves on the back. The
“fast trac ” bill would have given the presi-
dent authority to negotiate wide-ranging
trade deals with little time for debate and dis-
cussion. But President Clinton and his allies
— that is, the Republican leadership in
Congress —— decided it would be best to not
even bring the bill to ‘a vote,’ because they
realized that they were going to lose.

We won. And when I say “we,” I mean
the great majority of the people of the United
States, who by all indications opposed the
bill by a 2-to-1 margin. It was a political vic-
tory for the labor movement and the ordinary
people it represents, and a humbling experi-
ence for the unholy alliance between corpo-
rate liberals and the right wing.

The front page of The New York Times
the next day, in yet another stunning display
of media “objectivity,” carried_ a paranoid
story on the growing power of “big labor.” It

contained several graphics showing union
contributions to Democratic candidates, plus
numerous disapproving quotations from cor-
porate hacks and members of the
Democratic Leadership Council. Many of
you will remember that Bill Clinton himself
came out of the DLC, an organization which
has been trying for years to get the
Democratic Party to “move to the center”
(wherever the hell that is supposed to be). It
seems that our poor little moderate democ-
rats are very upset; you see, they want the
Democratic Party to act like well-behaved
little children for the beneﬁt of the business
class, but those dastardly unions are just get-
ting in the way.

For instance, the United Steel Workers
mobilized some 150,000 people to write let-
ters to congressmen opposing fast track
How can members of Congress carry out
their sacred duty of promoting the interests
of corporations, when they have to waste all
their time doing things like listening to the
concerns of their constituents? To the DLC
and -their natural allies in the Republican
party, unions are a “special interest,” while
the concerns of business are synonymous
with the “national interest.”

This twisted line of reasoning would be
amusing to behold, were it not for the dead-
ly seriousness of its proponents, who seem to
actually believe their own propaganda

Republicans’ atrocious welfare “reform”
bill, joined Wall Street’s crusade to privatize
social security, and promoted even more pro-
corporate trade deals, he is under constant
political attack from the right. We still occa-
sionally get drivel ﬁorn the likes of Ben
Wattenberg on the need for Clinton to “move
to the center,” i.e., more to the right. What
gives?

Well, anyway, I’d like to reiterate the
fact that we won. The
other side is ﬁghting
back, though. Those who
own and rule a society
can get pretty vindictive
when the lower orders get
uppity. This, in my opin-
ion, is the real motivation
behind the witch—hunt
against Ron Carey. The
Wall Street Journal has all
but endorsed Jimmy
Hoffa, Jr., to be the next

president of the Teamsters. They don’t like

Ron Carey because he’s on our side and likes
to say so publicly. If the old-style mobsters
came back into inﬂuence in the labor move-
ment, it would be a serious setback. Victories

Stereotypes pervasive, even in a column condemning them

Albert

Simmons

I was disturbed by Jessica
Birch’s Nov. 25 column, “TV
media coverage of crimes seems a
bit slanted,” because of the way it
rrrade fun of and trivialized the
important issue of minorities and
the media. I think this issue needs

‘ to be addressed and resolved. At

ﬁrst, I thought she would initiate
some intelligent dialogue on the
subject, but that was not the case.
Birch chose to demonstrate that her
vision of the black race came from
writings on a bathroom wall.

The media is a very powerful
tool capable of shaping people’s
perceptions and attitudes, and
although it is difficult to access the
impact the media has on race rela-
tions, whites have been shown by
polls to be more inﬂuenced by
media perceptions than blacks.

_  ﬁnding could make the media

programmers more aware of their
responsibilities, but that has not
happened. Maybe because paint-
ing blacks in a negative light has
rewards as far as ratings are a con-
cern, and it satisﬁes a hate that is

sewn into the social fabric of “Lookat ‘em, they deserve it”.

America.

I recall being in predominant-
ly white movie theaters where the
biggest laughs corrre from resentful
renrarks ‘made about blacks. I
know we were there to be enter-
tained, but I couldn’t help but to
wonder why my pain makes peo-
ple so happy. Maybe Birch got
laughs describing the Welfare
Momma and the Pimp, but I won-

der — did she understand that she _

used her column as a creative way
to give black stereotypes some
print by pretending to attack the
media?

The image of black people
that Birch conjured up is a collage
of stereotypes and gross general-

izations that a modern-day lynch '

mob could use to excite a crowd.
The way these people were
described insisted a bitter dislike
for black people. It implied that
these people are the scum of the
earth and that they deserved to be
fools. All the ills of the inner city
were reaped on these black images
to be gutted, hung, torched or
incarcerated and sentenced to
death. Birch’s voice implied,

I have tasted the wrath of
Birch’s message by employers,
would-be employers, teachers,
police, etc., so I do not take her
images lightly. They are a symp-
tom of a bigger disease that inﬁl-
trates every institution in America,
and what’s disturbing is that we are
becoming desensitized by this dis-
ease. It’s almost a cliche that some
black person will get the short end
of justice. It’s so commonplace that
acopwillkillablackmanunder
questionablelcircumstances that a
generic news script could be writ-
ten where only the names need to
be changed before a broadcast.
Don’t get me wrong —— I know the
problems that confront the black
community, but I also know what
is real and what is distorted.

Birch is not alone in express-
ing her slanted portrayal of black
people; her views are shared by
certain members of the English
department. I have a friend who is
in the Basic Reading and Writing
English class. My ﬁiend has been
out of school for a while and
thought it best to take the lowest-
level English class possible. We

would periodically discuss the
bookshereadforclass,anda
theme that recurred in all four
books was the despicable nature of
black people.

After continued discussion,
my friend decided to ask the two
teachers this question: Why does
every book we read describe black
people in a negative and derogato-
ry rrranner? He then asked the
teachers how they would feel if
they came-to a class where every
book they read put down white
folks? The teachers said they
would have a problem with that.
The teachers also acknowledged
his concern to be a legitimate one
and explained that the books were
not selected by them, but by the
English department I guess the per-
son in charge of choosing the
books was so used to reading about
the negativity of black people that
he thought this was an honest por-
trayal of all black people. It’s not.

I wish I could have taken
Birch to my grandrna’s house for
Thanksgiving. Grandma would
have told Birch to wipe her feet
and wash her hands before she sat
at the table. Then she would have

ﬁxedheraplatethatthreepeople
couldrr’t have eaten. My nieces and
nephews would have been nrnning
through the house and babies
would have been crying. You
would have heard my cousins,
aunts and uncles talk about tri-
umphs, defeats and struggles. You
might have heard a short argument
that grandma would have won,
because granddaddy is dead and
grandrna’s word is law. And yeah,
we do have a knucklehead or two
in the family who’ll do something
stupid and others, like me, who
will kick a little ass now and then,
but I think we are an average black
family, a real black family.

After a visit, Birch could have
written a story about “what is” and
not about “the hype.” Perhaps then
we could have sat down together
and discussed this complex issue
of race and how we can come up
with solutions, instead of hurling
insults at each other. I’d like that.
We all could use a little healing.

Albert Simmons believes stereotyp-
ing people should be avoided at all
costs, because every individual is
diﬁenentﬁom the next.

The Pitt Panthers basketball team
entered Tuesday’s matchup versus St.
Bonaventure with three upperclassmen
in the starting lineup.

All three had experience on last
year’s club. All three are expected by
coaches and players to lead this year’s
freshmen—f1lled club.

In the end, there was only one.

After playing 40 minutes,
Vonteego Cummings was the only non-
freshman left at the end of Pitt’s 86-80
loss to the Bonnies. He scored 21
points — two more than the total points
scored by sophomores Jarrett Lockhart
and Isaac Hawkins.

Cummings, the established team
leader, has played every minute of
Pitt’s regular season schedule so far.
And according to his coach, he’s start-
ing to feel the effects of his workload.

“Vonteego wore down a little -bit
tonight for the first time,” said Pitt
Head Coach Ralph Willard. “You
know, we’re asking him to do a lot.”

Willard praised his point guard’s

Cummings continues to go all out in

Bonniedefenders at the endof the sec-
ond half seem even more punishing.

Cummings was fouled hard twice,
but after climbing back» to his feet, he
missed both of his foul shots on both of
his trips to the charity stripe. He ﬁn-
ished four of nine from the foul line on
the night, with all of his misses coming
in the second half.

Still, despite his fatigue,
Cummings realized that his perfor-

mance was crucial to any hope of a

Panther victory.

“I tried to get the other guys
involved in the beginning,” Cummings
said, but in the end, it was up to a tired
team leader who didn’t seem to have

the energy to expand his scoring role.

In fact, the junior guard’s last two
points of the game came at the 5:30
mark of the second half, just after a Pitt
timeout, which was enough to cut the
Bonaventure lead to four.

With their field general nearly
decommissioned, Lockhart and
Hawkins had the opportunity to take
command. Lockhart actually started to

rise to the challenge at the 7:40 mark I

by nailing all three of his foul shots
after being fouled attempting a three-
pointer. On Pitt’s next possession, after
a Hawkins’ steal, Lockhart drained his
first three—pointer of the evening on his
seventh try.

Cummings’ layup came next, fol-
lowed by a Hawkins layin that brought
a silent crowd back into the contest.

Then, Hawkins registered his
fourth steal of. the night and, with a lit-
tle help from Ricardo Greer, converted

‘ it into a turnaround jump shot at the

other end of the ﬂoor. A Lockhart layup
later, and the Panthers had fought to a

But for all of Hawkins’ effort on

hurry. Bonaventure center Caswell

Majors and the old Pitt mentality of “We
played hard,” and “We didn’t give up out
there,” -4- two of Coach Majors’ favorite
post—loss cliches.

Pitt would have a “new attitude” for
1997 and in the football weight room, the
motto “Champions are made when
nobody is watching,” was inscribed.

And that’s what happened to basical—
ly the same team that went 4—7 last year.
This summer they conditioned, studied
and prepared for a new era in Pitt foot-
ball.

For once in a great while, there was ‘

pre—season hype surrounding Pitt foot-
ball. After traveling to watch pre—season
camp at Pitt—Johnstown I didn’t see a rea-
son for all the hoopla. The offense looked
confused_and all Walt Harris kept saying
was “It’s going to take time.”

Time, I thought.

I don’t have time.

I’m a senior.

I need Pitt to be good right now.

I want a winning season.

I want a bowl game.

FROM PAGE 7

I may have been selﬁsh,’ but I had
been to every Pitt home game the past
three years and felt I deserved something
—— didn’t we all? I

After wins it over i Southwestern
Louisiana and Houston and a non-
blowout against Penn State, Pitt turned in
the first of several captivating memories
against Miami on Homecoming.

I was in the press box as John Jenkins
sealed the game with a gutsy interception.
I couldn’t keep my composure in the
press box — I knew I had to rush the field
with rest of my peers who had been wait-
ing as long as I had for some on—field van-
dalism. Students were hugging players,

players were hugging each other and the '

goal post crowd surfed for a good hour.

That was a peak in the season,
because it was followed with losses to
Temple, Notre Dame, Boston College
and Syracuse. The season appeared to be
lost with Pitt at 4-5. On the horizon
loomed first place Virginia Tech and the
pesky Mountaineers.

Once again, I was in the press box for
the Tech game. After falling behind early,
Pitt dominated Tech with an unstoppable

oﬁense and timely defense. It was senior ‘

day for the players and the seniors shined
‘in‘the‘ victory. My memory is walking out
of the press box and looking at the ﬁeld

ﬂooded with students. It was crazy. Then

Harris got on the microphone and gave a
“proud to be a Pitt Panther” speech. I’ll
never forget the last game I saw as a Pitt
student.

After the Tech win, a bowl berth rode
on a victory over West Virginia. In what
probably was the best ending to a college
football game I’ve ever seen. Pitt beat the
Mountaineers 41-38 in triple overtime.
Although I wasn’t there, the picture I will
always have is the celebration of the Pitt
players pumping their fists in the air and
hugging anyone they could find after
Terry Murphy’s game—winning touch—
down catch.

The victory and this season will go
down as one of the most memorable in
Pitt’s storied football history. But more
importantly, this season gave Pitt students

' and myself some school pride and a few

memories to tell our grandkids.

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports
editor for the Pitt News and is ready for
one more memory in Memphis.

well,” Loper said of the squad’s perfor~
mance. “We should move into the top 10
after this.”

Saturday’s first—place ﬁnish coupled A

with a dominating 41 —3 win over Slippery
Rock and an impressive 21-12 win at
Bloomsburg keeps the Panthers flawless
on the year.

Next up, however, is the Las Vegas
Invitational, a tournament that’s even
tougher than Lock Haven.

“The Las Vegas tournament is like a
inininationals. Everybody and their
brother is going to be there,” Stottlemyer
said. “But we’re taking 10 decent guys,
so we’re looking forward to the chal-
lenge.”

The wrestlers are also aware of just
how tough the trip to Sin City will be.

“That tournament is tough as hell,”
Loper said. “The top three or four kids in
every weight class will be out there. But
we think we can place in the top ﬁve.”

Stottlemyer said he has already
noticed an improvement in his team’s
aggressiveness since the beginning of the
season and that he expects the team to get
better and better as the year goes on.

taking an early 4-2 lead. But the lead seesawed numerous times
during the first half.

At the 13:45 mark of the ﬁrst half, junior guard Vonteego
Cummings supplied a play for the highlight reels.

The Panthers’ full—coult press caused an errant Bonnie pass
that Cummings, who was tiptoeing the sideline, threw behind his
back to guard J arett Lockhart, who then gave it back to Cummings
for a layup that brought the crowd to its feet and gave Pitt its
biggest lead of the game, at 15-8.

However, Palmer, who is nicknamed “Little Shaq” by his
teammates, kept the Bonnies in the game, scoring 15 of his 24
points in the first half.

The Panthers led the contest 37-35 at halftime. A

The second half began with a 6-0 Pitt rim that was capped by
an Isaac Hawkins dunk to give Pitt a 41-37 lead.

But, Winn and the Bonnies began to pull away. Winn hit a
three that gave St. Bonaventure a 46-43 lead, and it built a lead of
59-52 before the Panthers rallied.

The Panthers had a chance to win the game late in the second
half, but appeared to run out of gas down the stretch. Lockhart hit
a three-pointer at 6:10 to cut the lead to 66-62. And at the 4:10
mark, Hawkins grabbed a loose ball in the lane and hit a jumper
to cut the lead to two points. On the Bonnies’ next possession,
Lockhart stole the ball ﬁorn Winn at rnidcourt and completed a
layup to tie the game at 70.

That was as close as the Panthers would get, however. Winn
hit another three with 2:04 remaining, and converted on three of
four foul shots to ice the victory for the Bonnies.

Cummings ﬁnished with a team-high 21 points and four .
assists. Freshmen Attila Cosby and Ricardo Greer, ﬁnished with V
14 points each. Lockhart added 10 points and Hawkins scored
mne. '

The loss dropped the Panthers to 2-2, while the win raised St.
Bonaventure’s record to 4-1.

dunk that Hawkins did little to stop.

Pitt didn’t reclaim the lead. Hawkins did put
the team within four with just over a minute
remaining, but on the next possession, Lockhart
fouled out. He finished with 10 points, including
a 1-7 showing from beyond the three-point arc.

Part of the problem for Lockhart, at least on
the defensive end, came with the foul trouble of
freshman Greer. Greer had been covering Bonnie
forward Rashaan Palmer early in the contest, but
switched off after registering three fouls midway
through the first half.

Willard said after the game that he had no
other players who could guard Palmer success-
fully. Lockhart drew the duty anyway, and
Palmer led the Bonnies with 24 points on the
night.

“We just told him to [attack],” said St.
Bonaventure Head Coach Jim Baron of his lead-
ing scorer. . -

Palmer’s free throw at the 1:10 mark made
the score 80-73 Bonnies. The Bonnies would
coast to the end of the contest, forcing Pitt to foul
and then making the ensuing foul shots.

Hawkins committed the team’s last foul with
14 ticks left on the clock, sending Palmer to the
line for his final point of the night. The Pitt
sophomore left the game with nine points after
39 minutes of action. 1

His coach was less than impressed with the
performance of Hawkins and his frontcourt
mates. _

“They just physically manhandled us,”
Willard said. ‘
