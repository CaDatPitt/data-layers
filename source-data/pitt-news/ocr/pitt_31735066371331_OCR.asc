Pitt scientists map cosmos

By Deborah Nichols

The Pitt News

The team of scientists at Pitt's
Allegheny Observatory has de-
veloped a new astronomical
device capable of detecting
planetary systems around other
stars.

The Multichannel Astromet-
ric Photometer(MAP) invented
by observatory director and Pitt
astronomy professor George D.
Gatewood uses state-of-the-art
electronic techniques to measure
the motion of stars. MAP's ten-
fold improvement in accuracy
over older photographic tech-
niques has opened the door to
confirming the existence of
planets in other solar systems. In
addition to ongoing research at
Pitt, NASA is considering plac-
ing a MAP-equipped telescope

tistical fluke.“ Until recently,
there was no way to prove the
assertions of theorists that other
planetary systems should exist.

“Now it's a whole new ball
game." said Dr. John Stein,
research assistant professor at
Pitt and a member of the MAP
research team, “and we have a
thousandfold expansion of
territory."

The patent issued on Oct. 14,
I983, was the culmination of a
long process of invention,
design, and testing that began l0
years ago when NASA scientists
contacted Gatewood to inquire
whether astrometers might be
able to confirm the existence of
other planets.

According to Dr. John Bil-
lingham of NASA Life Sciences
at Ames Research Center in Cali-
fornia, “The original stimulus for

Abzug: women will
oust Reagan in fall

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

American women will vote Presi-
dent Reagan out of office in the
~.'\'ovember election, ex-(’ongress-
woman Bella Ab/ug predicted last
week on International Women‘s
Day.

A member of the U.S. House of
Representatives from |97l to I977.
the New York Democrat spoke to
over I()() women at the downtown
Kaufmann's Author Luncheon
Briefing on Thursday. She visited
Pittsburgh to promote her new
book, “Gender Gap: Bella Ab/ug's
Guide to PoliticaJ Power for Ameri-
can Women.“

“Traditionally, women were
trained to speak softly and carry a
lipstick." she said. “but now we've
realized that we have a weapon —
our vote."

Women are at odds with Reagan‘s
stands on every issue of foreign and
domestic policy, Ablug said.

According to Abzug. ,more
women than men favor a nuclear
freeze and oppose U.S. intervention
in El Salvador. “The women‘s vote is
a peace vote.” she said.

More women that men support
social programs to aid the poor.
abortion rightsand the Equal Rights
Amendment. Abzug said. “We
didn’t create the arms race. the big
budget deficit and the cuts in social
programs." she said. “but we will
end them.“

According to Ab/ug. in the l98()
election. 8 percent fewer women
than men voted for Reagan because
he opposed the F RA and was seen as
too militaristic.

“The ERA lost," Ab/ug said.
“because male legislators eouldn‘t
care less about the lives of their sis-
ters. wives. daughters and mothers."

In order to ensure that women’s
views are reflected by government
policies. more women must vote and
more women legislators must be
elected. she said, reminding her
audience that there are 22 women
and 445 men in the House of Repre-
sentatives and two women and 48
men in the Senate.

While six million more women
than men voted in the l980 presiden-
tial election, the difference will swell
to nine million in I984. Abzug
predicted.

“I984 could be a watershed year,"
she said. “the first time that women
could decide which party will con-
trol Congress, who will reside in
governors’ mansions. who will serve
in state legislatures and who will fill
thousands of local offices.“

The gender gap does not reflect
the views of all women. Ab/.ug said,
“but while men have always led
women. now we are leading men."

When men‘s consciousness
changes. the gender gap will narrow.
Abzug said. "but in the meantime.
we must make the gender gap
bigger.“

Journalist warns of

government doubletalk

By Marty Willis
The Pitt News

George Orwell‘s famous novel
“l984“ should not be interpreted
literally as a prediction of future
totalitarian society, although signs
that present governments manipu-
lative language are growing increas-
ingly evident, according to
syndicated columnist Tom Wicker.

Wicker, an associate editor of The
New York Times, delivered the key-
note address Friday for the “George
Orwell Days" program held over the
weekend at the Pittsburgh Theologi-
cal Seminary in East Liberty.

Wicker said Orwell‘s “newspeak,”
a government's hypnotizing use of
language as propaganda to manipu-
late and brainwash its population, is
an accurate description of govern-

mental doubletalk in our era.

To the 57-year-old Wicker, the
“Big Lie" tactics used in Nazi Ger-
many to mesmerize the population
are far from unique in modern his-
tory. He cited several examples of
political doubletalk used by the Rea-
gan administration. -

HomeSharing

Elderly to open homes, hearts

By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

For many Americans, growing
old has often meant giving up famil-
iar surroundings to enter convales-
cent homes, often prematurely.
HomeSharing, a new local program,
is designed to change that by encour-
aging elderly people to remain in
their communities and to share their
homes with others.

The program is designed to unite
people looking for housing with
those who have space available and
are willing to share, according to
Edward Schwartz, the facilitator for
the program.‘ .

Schwartz said the program offi— .

cially began ‘ in Pittsburgh last
month but has not finalized any
homesharing partn'erships. The first
participants will probably link up
later this month.

HomeSharing is administered
locally by the South Hills Interfaith
Ministries in cooperation with
Housing Ministries Inc. of Pitts-
burgh. The idea is two years old and
has been implemented successfully
in a handful of cities, including Phil-
adelphia and Boston.

Schwartz said he is enthusiastic
about the program. The elderly are
able to remain in their homes and
neighborhoods, and others, includ-
ing college students, can find afford-
able housing.

The program provides compan-
ionship and a sense of security for
the elderly resident and, when the
boarder agrees, another able body to
help around the house, Schwartz
explained.

Living arrangement costs vary.
but Schwartz said it ranges from $75
to $200 per month. Many arrange-
ments are based on mutual work
sharing agreements. There are sev-
eral requirements that must be met
before any living arrangement can
be finalized. A senior citizen must be
certified to be in good health by his
doctor. Also, both people must con-
sult individually with a staff
member.

The South Hills Interfaith Minis-
tries asks for two references from
each person. The home is inspected.
Schwartz said, and each person gets
a private room, although the pro-
gram emphasizes providing more
than just a room.

Following the screening process.

HomeSharing

the South Hills staff matches appli-
cants with compatible interests and

needs. The couple can make their
own arrangements or decisions
about sharing living space, Schwartz
said.

South Hills suggests persons shar-
ing a home sign a standard “housing
agreement," but if both agree. no
agreement is necessary. Schwartz
said. The agreement could include
work sharing and dissolution of the
arrangement. "depending on what
the couple have agreed upon. he

“Super Tuesday” is here

The five Democratic presidential hopefuls gathered in
Atlanta yesterday for a debate,just two days before Gary Hart
and Walter Mondale square off on “Super Tuesday.” Mondale
is in an uphill battle to stop Hart, who’s gathered a string of
four "victories going into Tuesday’s contest. Wyoming was the
fourth state in which Hart defeated Mondale.

Abortion appeal struck down

HARRISBURG — The Commonwealth Court has struck
down state laws that would have eliminated about 98 percent of -
the publicly funded abortions in Pennsylvania. Neither of the
laws were put into affect because of legal challenges that were
filed with the state. The appeals court said the laws violated the

'state’s equal rights amendment and impinged on a poor wom-
an’s privacy and her right to equal protection under the
Constitution.

  Opinions   

, Judgement Day

Making mountains out of molehills. That seems to be what
most political forecasters have been doing in the battle between
Gary Hart and Walter Mondale. Tuesday, we may finally find
out which of these men, if not both, may actually have a strong
following. We may also find out if either of these two isjust a
paper tiger, make to order by an over-anxious press.

For years, the press has singled out Mondale as the defacto
Democratic nominee. They have given every move he's made
such undue attention one would have thought he’djust pulled
off some major political coup rather thanjust begun gearing up
for the primaries.

An aura was formed around Mondale; he was unstoppable
—— a shining knight, come to save his crumbling party. The only
problem was that the press forgot to ask the voters if it was
right.

If there had been no exaggerated Mondale promotion, there
would have been no surprise when Hart scored so well in lowa,
New Hampshire, Maine, and now, Montana. But there was,
and the press was surprised, as was America. At least that‘s
what the press said.

Each candidate has been able to use the press‘ eagerness to
find a front runner to his advantage. Mondale tried to convince
would-be supporters that there was no race because he’d
already won. Just read the headlines. Hart, a smart political
tactician, played coy and quiet. Being the press’ new-found
love, he needs to do little more than accentuate the virtues they
extoll.

But tomorrow is Super Tuesday, and tonight, the two men
will rest uneasily in their beds. They’ll get little sleep as they lay
in the darkness of their hotel rooms wondering, now that the
press has had its say, how much it will sway the voters. Finally,
the public will have its say.

Mondale has become lazy in promoting his views despite
criticism that he has been catering to too many special interest
groups. And Hart may be riding his tidal-wave of increased
popularity, but now’s the time to prove why he should stay on
lap.

America’s presidential race needed a good knock-down,
drag-out fight for votes. If nothing else, it should greatly
increase participation in the race. Voters who may not have
been satisfied with Mondale but saw no alternative now may

have the chance to vote for t.he man who more closely repre-
sents their views. And with key southern states also up for grabs
on Tuesday (Alabama, Georgia and Florida), Jackson, Glenn
and McGovern may still be able to get enough support to get
some of their planks into the Democrat‘s final platform.

Despite what Mondale may have hoped, the race did not end
in Iowa, and despite what Hart may wish, New England does
not vote for the nation. There is no leader until after the vote.
George McGovern’s advice is still the voters best guide — vote
your conscience, not the consensus. ‘

Letters to the Esiitor

Group’s
spending
defended

Speaking as one who attended last
Thursdays meeting of the Student
Government Board, I would like to
confirm that The Pit: News gave a
fairly complete account of SGB
member Avery Abrams’ charges
against Students for Life in last Fri-
day's paper, (March 2), as well as
Allocations Chairman Stephen
Smith‘s criticism of those charges.

l was extremely disturbed, how-
ever, that you printed such allega-
tions against a student group —» on
the front page no less‘—- without
even trying to contact either the
accused group or the Office of Stu-
dent Activities to see ifthere was any
substance to the these charges.

If so, you would have found that
Students for Life had not misused
their advertising funds at all. I base
this statement on budget specifica-
tions for Students for Life on file in
the Office of Student Activities, in
case any ofyour reporters would like
to follow up your somewhat mis-
leading cover story.

The personal ads that Mr.
Abrams found objectionable and
read aloud at Thursday‘s meeting
appeared in November and March
editions of The Pitt News last year.
They contained short descriptions of
an unborn child‘s development in
order to stimulate thought on the
legitimacy of legalized abortion.

“Using ads for ideological mes-
sages is a clear violation of alloca-
tions," Mr. Abrams charged. This.
however. is a misstatement of the
guidelines set down in the Alloca-
tions Manual.

Under “Items Not Funded," the
manual lists “materials that espouse
and/or proselytize specific political

or religious ideologies." (Emphasis
added.)
The ads which Students for Life

‘submitted contained no references

to religion or politics at all, much
less any endorsement of a specific
religion's doctrines or political par-
ty‘s platform. Rather, the ads‘argu-
ments were based on biological facts
and general ethical principles that
happen to be shared by both reli-
gious andsecular, political and non-
political groups and individuals.

ln fact, funds for such “ideologi-
cal messages" had been approved by
SGB for Students for Life for the
period in which the ads in question
appeared. In the l982-83 school
year, the budget for Students for
Life provided for 96 personal ads.
No stipulations were attached to
their content.

For the present school year, Stu-
dents for Life has been allocated ads
for recruitment purposes and meet-
ing announcements only.

These restrictions have been fol-
lowed. All “ideological messages"
that have appeared in The Pitt News
this year have been paid for out of
the members‘ own pockets.

If Mr. Abrams‘ objections
stemmed from a confusion between
last year's and this year‘s budget re-
strictions, then they are entirely
understandable. The only statement
of his that remains disturbing in his
contention that “due process did not
come into play“ in this matter
because the alleged misuse of funds
was such a “blatant violation of
allocations.“

Due process is a right guaranteed
by both our university and our Con-
stitution to all accused parties,
whether their alleged “blatant viola-
tion" ' involves misused funds or
grand larceny or assault. It always
comes into play. One hopes that Mr.

Abrams‘ decision to single out Stu-V

dents for Life - admittedly, a con-
troversial group —» for denial ofdue

process was based solely on igno-
rance of these principles.

If not, his statement that “thg

issues did not nor should not involve
his own ideologies," unfortunately,
is very difficult to believe.

With the new look of Renaissance
II now firmly established in Pitts-
burgh. the new skyscrapers and gen-
trified drinking and dining
establishments have brought a new
concept to Pittsburgh as well: The
“Yuppie.“ Now that the city has this
slapdash atmosphere. the people
who partake in this ever—so-bright
revitalization need a snappy title as
well. Hence. the label Young Urban
Professional (YUP).

Yuppies eat in fashionable restau-
rants where concern for the quality
of the food is secondary to how well
you can see and be seen by other
patrons. Yuppies go to (iiullifty‘s a
lot. They rise early on the weekends
for a IOK run. Yuppies read novels
appearing on The New York Times’

bestseller list or don dress suits
designed by Evan Picone.

People. in general. have no sense
of individuality nowadays. Every-
one has a label or title attached to
him. If you're in grade school. you're
an adolescent. At this stage. you

MAP device tracks stars

c'onIinued_/"mm page one

Search for extra-terrestial intelli-
gence [SETI]. The idea of support-
ing Allegheny [Observatory] was to
begin the long process ofdeveloping
the instruments and systems neces-
sary to detect them."

The area of concentration at
Allegheny Observatory is astrome-
try, the branch of astronomy that
studies the positions. Gatewood said
he estimates “there are about a
dozen astrometrists in the whole
world." Nearly half of these had
theiriprofessional training at Pitt.

Gatewood began participating in
the SETI conference by discussing
the limits of astrometry. He demon-
strated that previous claims to have
detected planets were the result of
errors in method or equipment. The
photographic methods of tradi-
tional astrometry often had a mar-
gin of error wider than the
“wobbles" or “perturbations“ in star
motion which could be caused by an
orbiting planet or planets.

According to Gatewood, the pos-
sibility ofa new electronic method to
track the motions of stars originated
at an early SETI meeting, when

radio astronomer Dr. Frank Drake

of Cornell University challenged
astrometrists to consider the “astro-
nometric accuracy of a photon
stream.

The idea that ﬁnally made the
MAP promising, Gatewood said,
came to him one morning on awak-
ening. “I didn’t go to the [bedroom]
door,” Gatewood said. “I went right
to my desk, which is in the bedroom,
and worked for several hours. When
the numbers looked realistic, I made
a long-distance phone call to David
Black at NASA.”

Gatewood’s breakthrough idea
was to replace the slits with a finely-
lined ruling which could slide [back
and forth in front of the light sen-
sors, providing many readings per
hour. The potential combination of

pared against expected star motions
derived from years of photographic
studies, including 70 years of such
work at Allegheny Observatory.

Long-exposure photographs taken
at intervals over the period of a year

show the star‘s motion in the sky to
be along a wavy path.

MAP has also influenced other
changes in observatory equipment.
Continued development and testing
of the MAP soon made it obvious
that to take full advantage of the
accuracy of the device, a new lens
was needed for the observatory‘s
refractor, the Thaw telescope.

The new lens, which is expected to
arrive sometime this summer, was
designed by a computer into which
the dozens of relevant parameters
had been programmed. The compu-
ter’s recommendation was a lens
that would focus light in the red end
of the spectrum. This result was

George Field, Robert Wheeler Wil-
son Professoriof Applied Astron-
omy at Harvard University and
senior scientist at the Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
authored the report. In a telephone
interview, he predicted that the dis-
covery of extrasolar planets will be
made in the next decade or two.

“The whole planetary detection
thing has become tremendously
exciting,” Field said. “There is a
great deal of interest. If someone
could discover and verify their exist-
ence in a very certain way, this
research could become a large part
of astronomy."

Field emphasized that the plane-
tary search is “an extremely chal-
Ienging task.” But he added. “The
payoff is tremendous."

Excitement is generating at the
idea of putting a MAP-equipped tel-
escope in earth‘s orbit. “In space this
has incredible precision,” Gatewood
said.

Outside earth’s atmosphere,
MAP‘s accuracy increases from
thousandths to millionths ofan arc-
second, a gain ofthree magnitudes.
This will be enough precision to
detect earth-sized planets, he said.
An orbital MAP would increase the
range of a planetary survey. “From
space, we can aim it at any star in the
galaxy,” Gatewood said.

According to Dr. David Black,
NASA research scientist and admin-
istrator with the Planetary Detec-
tion Program at Ames Research
Center, a space-borne MAP “has an
excellent chance of approval in the
not-too-distant future." One excit-
ing new possibility is the prospect of
including a MAP-equipped tele-
scope on one ofthe unmanned plat-
forms that will be part of the
proposed Space Station.

With the planetary search, he
said, “we‘re interrogating nature,
looking for certain physical effects.
Thev‘re either there or they‘re not.

efficiency and accuracy was well
worth pursuing.

It was time to put a working team
together.

John Stein, Gatewood‘s colleague
in Pitt’s Physics and Astronomy
Department. organized much ofthe
team’s work. Team members, some
of whom continue to work on the
MAP, have included Gatewood.
Stein, electronics systems design
engineer Charles DiFatta, Ron Goe-
bel, Lee Breakiron, Steve Kinsel.
Steve Kipp, Jim Prosser, Jane Rus-
sell, and head observer Tom Rei-
land. Both NASA and the National
Science Foundation have funded the
research.

By fall of I978, a single—channel
(one light—sensor) prototype called
the Image Trailer had been mounted
and tested on the Thaw refractor.
with good results. Stein built ‘the
first full-scale prototype in the
Allegheny Observatory‘s machine
shop, and it was tested in the latter
half of I979. “It worked,",Stein said.
“but it was not easy to use.“

Data from. the MAP was com-

altered only very slightly in order to
avoid an artificial light source in the
Pittsburgh sky. Gatewood said in
the extreme red range focused by the
new lens. the sky over Pittsburgh
will look as perfectly dark as if the
observatory were out in the country
instead of within the Pittsburgh city
limits.

The two-piece lens is being manu-
factured by the Schott Glass Com-
pany and will cost $132,000. Pitt and
private donors are underwriting the
new lens, which will be formallyded-
icated after its installation late this
summer.

Photographic work will still be
conducted at Allegheny Observa-
tory, and its collection of Il2,()00
photographic plates maintained; but
Gatewood said he envisions a grad-
ual replacement ofthe photographic
method by devices like the MAP.

The use of [MAP devices for
planet detection was endorsed by the
Astronomical Survey Committee of
the National Academy ofScience, in
a report called “Astronomy and
Astrophysics for the 1980s.“ Dr.

When we get done [with a thorough
survey] we can make a very powerful
statement, one way or the other. The
outcome will have profound impli-
cations for mankind and for percep-
tions of our place in the universe."

Black said the MAP has “abso-
Iutely“ fulfilled its early promise. He
added, “The field of astrometry is
extremely conservative. George
[Gatewood] is atypicaI...his contri-
bution is to stir up and bring the field
into the 20th century.“

Gatewood said that cosmologists
have expressed much interest in
using the MAP to study deep-sky
phenomena such as quasars and
black holes. as well as to provide an
accurate two—dimensional mapping
of the sky to farther distances than
are now possible.

“The projects it could do are cos-
mologically interesting. not just in
the local neighborhood." Gatewood
said. “’I'heorists in cosmology ‘and
astrometrists are coming together."

The findings from MAP “will pro-
duce work for another whole gener-
ation of astronomers." he said.

Computer engineer Cas
DiFatta explained the measuring
principle of the MAP with the
analogy of watching headlights
blink in and out of sight behind
the slats. If we‘re observing care-
fully enough, we can learn some-
thing about the cars’ movements
with respect to one another by
observing how they are spaced
out behind the slats, and how fast
they appear and disappear
behind them. If we look at the
window once, and then again a
few minutes later, we can see
these changes.

The Multichannel Astromet-
ric Photometer (MAP) is a large
black box of electronics about
two feet square and six inches
deep which can be attached to
the viewing end of the 30-inch
Thaw refracting telescope.

At the heart of the MAP is a
plate, called a platen with eight
holes, or channels, drilled in it, to
correspond to the positions of
the stars that are being mea-
sured. Light receptors, or

How MAP works

    

probes, are paced into the holes.

Professor John Stein offered
the following analogy to give
some idea of the precision ofthe
MAP. ‘

“Ifa man were standing on the
moon with a flashlight, and if he
moved it from his left to his right
hand, the MAP could detect it."

Observato ente

On a hill in Riverview Park,
overlooking Pittsburgh’s North
Side, stands a light-colored
brick-and—stone building
crowned with three white tele-
scope domes. Allegheny ()_bser-
vatory is as much a monument as
a building. Its walls are filleted
with the chisled names of famous
astronomers: Galileo, Newton,
Kepler. Inside the double doors,
a bronze statue of John Brashear
presides over the Rotunda,
under the stained-glass gaze of
Urania. the muse of astronomy.
The materials and proportions of
the observatory’s neoclassical
architecture bespeak a sense of
tradition and permanence.

Allegheny Observatory will
mark its l25th birthday next
year. According to historical
records, Allegheny Observatory
began as the Allegheny Tele-
scope Association, a group of
prominent businessmen who
built an observatory to house
their I3-inch telescope, which
was the third-largest instrument
:n the muntrv at that time.

On March ll. I860, the Penn-
sylvania legislature incorporated
the association as Allegheny
Observatory. The original build-
ing was located on a hill on the
North Side of Pittsburgh. near
present-day Triangle Tech. Eight
years later, the observatory was
given to Western University of
Pennsylvania (forerunner of the
University of Pittsburgh) and

became the foundation of its
astronomical science depart-
ment.

1 we 'I“l§.l"1_J‘IiC3’_VI:5,'1VlU‘ll}1ﬂ)'s~1V14}‘;"‘ My 5707'“ 

The observatory has a distin-

guished history of scientific
achievements under its succes-
sion of directors. The first salar-
ied director was Samuel P.
Langley, who after 20 years at
Allegheny became the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution.
While at Allegheny, he con-
ducted pioneering astronomical
work. He also introduced one of
the earliest systems of standard-
ized time in the United States.
John Brashear of Pittsburgh. a
self-taught telescopic lens maker
of great skill. served as acting
director of the observatory at the
turn of the century. A statue of
John Brashear occupies a room
on the main floor of the present
building, which Brashear was
instrumental in establishing.
The present observatory was

25th year

completed in l9I2. It boasted
three domes housing three tele-
scopes. among them the original
I3-inch scope. The first telescope
to operate in the building was the
31-inch Keeler memorial reflect-
ing telescope, which focuses star-
light on a mirrored surface. The
30-inch Thaw refractor is a glass-
lens instrument, the third largest
of its kind in existence.

What is unique about the
Thaw refractor is its lens, the
largest ever designed specifically
for photographic work.

The observatory came into
prominence in the area of astro-
nometric observation following
the installation of the 30-inch
Thaw refractor. Incoming direc-
tor Frank Schlesinger had
Changed the design of the refrac-
tor lens from visual to photogra-
phic. _

In I914, Schlesinger began a
program of taking photographic
observations with the Thaw
refractor. The long exposure
time possible with photographs
allowed the detection of starts
not visible with the human eye.

A library of l l2,000 photogra-
phic plates is stored in the plate
Vault in the observatory’s base-
ment. , '

The staff of the observatory
conducts tours of the facilities
from April through October.
The tours are sponsored by the
Helen Clay Frick Foundation
and reservations are required.

in Lebanon of American pilot
Robert Goodman a “peace mission”
is to engage in a real-life version of
newspeak. Wicker said. He also
pointed out other similarities.

The U.S. Department of Defense
was called the War Department
until 1947, and Lyndon Johnson‘s
administration referred to the mas-
sive bomb attacks on Vietnam as a
“protective reaction."

“They can make you say anything,

. but they can't make you believe it,”
Wicker said, reading from a passage
in the novel. “I984 is, to me, a state-
ment ofaffirmation and faith...a tes-
tament against that state power over
individuals," he explained.

The North Carolina-born Wicker
announced that he had coined a new
term, “ownlife," which he defined as
“the insistence that two plus two are
four, not five.” ln “ l984,“characters
could be convinced that two plus
two equaled anything they were
told.

Orwell deliberately included vivid
descriptions of a young couples sex-
ual relations and a wild songbird’s
passionate oration as a tribute to
individuality and nonconformity, he
said.

Although Orwell was a socialist
and was wounded fighting the fas-
cists in the Spanish Civil War,
Wicker said he is covinced that
“ l 984" is “almost totally a nonpoliti-
cal book."

“George Orwell Days" was the
idea of H. Eberhard von Waldow,
an Old Testament professor at the
seminary. Before introducing
Wicker to the large, enthusiastic
audience, von Waldow read a letter
of greetings from Mayor Richard
Caligiuri, who had planned to
attend but was called away unex-
pectedly.

“Since the real mayor could not
come, we decided to have another
mayor here,” von Waldow
explained, introducing Patrick
Dunster, a former Carnegie—Mellon
University drama student, as the
“appointed“ mayor of a fictional
future Pittsburgh.

Dunster, without cracking a
smile, delivered such Orwellian
remarks as: “We pledge allegiance to
the goodthink of prophet Citizen
Orwell, which Crimethink calls war-
ning....We hail Big Brother....Death
to Oldthink, Oldspeak and Oldfeel:
nonthink is goodthink for all.”

“I, legalful appointed Mayor of
the City of Pittsburgh, in the name
of our oncleader Big Brother, full-
wise welcome you to this celebration
of Party, nonthink and yes-say."

By BRENDAN FOLEY

The first transit study which
recommended a subway for the
city of Pittsburgh occurred in
1906. Even then, Pittsburghers
realized the importance of a
mass transit system for the
world’s busiest inland port. Not
until nearly eight decades later,
with much disturbance to both
pedestrian and auto traffic, is
this dream to be realized. The
City of Champions is finally the
proud owner of a championship
subway system.

By the end of the year, the
trolleys will disappear from the
streets of downtown and occupy
their new right-of—way beneath
the city’s streets. Downtown
streets will be lest congested and
commuters will wait in spacious,
artistic stations for their ride
home. It has been a long time in
coming, but the Golden Trian-
gle’s buried treasurse will soon
be a viable, operating subway.

A RAILROAD TUNNEL
AND BRIDGE ARE
REBORN

In 1865, the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company extended its
rail line west of Pittsburgh. This
line, known as the Steubenville
Extension, required the con-
struction of a tunnel under the
city and a bridge over the
Monongahela River. These two
structures, built nearly 120 years
ago, are the heart of PAT’s
Renaissance II project. State I of
the Light Rail Transit (LRT)
system.

The Panhandle Bridge
crosses the Monongahela
between the Liberty and Smith-
field Street Bridges. It was built
to handle ‘heavyrail loads, but it
was weakened by weather and a
fire in 1963. Therefore rusty and
damaged steel members have to
be replaced. The bridge must
also be sandblasted, and the ties
and track on the bridge must
also be replaced.

The Pennsylvania Railroad
tunnel ran under the Manor
Building, the Allegheny County
Jail, through the subterranean
levels of the U.S. Steel Building
and emerged on the north side
of Seventh Avenue. the north-
ern section of the tunnel was
replaced with a single track con-
figuration through the U.S. Steel
Building in 1968 during con—
struction of the buiding.

THE MIDTOWN STATION

The central section of the tun-
nel was demolished to accom-
modate the construction of
Midtown Station. This station is
the junction of the eastern sub-
way branch, which follows the
old railroad tunnel to the Pen-
nsylvania Railroad Station and
the western subway branch
under Sixth and Liberty
Avenues.

University 0! Pittsburgh

Midtown is the largest of the
the three underground stations,
having two underground levels:
a mezzanine, and a platform
level. Midtown hs three plat-
forms. The central platform
serves as an inbound platform to
Gateway Center and an out-
bound platform from Penn Park
Statio. The west platform serves
as an outbound platform from
Gateway Center, and the east
platform serves as an inbound
platform to Penn Park.

Architecturally, Midtown Sta-
tion will blend with the Steel
Plaza. Large two-story colums
which reach from the floor to the
ceiling are jointly owned by PAT
and U.S. Steel Realty. These
columns not only support the
station, but they also serve as
the foundation for a future hotel/
garage complex.

The floors of the mezzanine
and platform levels will be a ter-
razzon texture of white cement
with dark marble chips. The
stairway walls and platform
benches will be made of polished
granite. Approximately three-
fourths of the wall space will be
covered with artwork from three
local artists. the artwork centers
around a floor-to-ceiling glass
block wall, blacklit with neon
and flourescent lights, with wide
bands of bright colors painted
across the background. The sta-
tion will be lit with mercury
vapor lights separated by decor-
ative bafﬂes.

For safety reasons, the stairs
will be made of a light gray
coarse granite. There will also be
a three -foot warning track at the
edge of each platform made of
the same material. The warning
track is lighter in color than the
rest of the floor, and for the sight
impaired, is rougher than the
rest of the platform floor.

SIXTH AVENUE GETS AN
UNDERGROUND
RESIDENT

The concrete subway box
under Sixth Avenue extends
from the curb with the bottom of
the tunnel 40 feet below the
street level. The basement levles
of the Mellon Square Garage ,
the Oliver Building, and Gimbels
also extend to the curbs. Only
two inches of styrofoam separ-
ates the subway shell from the
basements of these three
buildings.

The Duquesne Light and
Smithfield Buildings each have
shallow foundations. Steel pipes
30 inches in diameter had to be
driven into the ground and filled
with concrete to provide .ade—
quate support for the buildings.

A two-story room under the
sidewalk in front of Trinity
Cathedral and First Presbyter-
ian Church will house ventilation

fans, electrical transformers,
communications, and signal
equipment.

AZENS BUILDING IS
TRANSFORMED INTO A
SUBWAY STATION

0 With the purchase of the
Azens Building, PAT was able to
construct the Wood Street Sta-
tion. The station is cross shaped
and extends under the Wood
Street/Sixth Avenue intersec-
tion. _

Like Midtown, Wood Street
will have two levels. However,
due to the nature of the under-
ground utilities, the mezzanine
will not have a view of the plat-
form level. A wall 200 feet in
length on the mezzanine level
will be covered by a nine-foot
high mural of Georgian marble
inlaid with black slate in 13 large
geometric shapes.

Wood Street Station has two
platforms, one inbound, and one
outbound. Like Midtown, the
warning track and stairs will be
made of a light gray coarse gran-
ite. Cornices, hand rails,
benches, and columns will be
wrapped in polished stainless
steel.

Pittsburgh’s water table at the
Wood Street Station, along the
Liberty Avenue Tunnel, and at
Gateway Center Station aver-
ages 35 feet below street level.
The bottom of the subway tun-
nel is 40 feet below street level.
This required the construction
of a series of wells along Liberty
Avenue to lower the water table
to 50 feet. The water was
pumped into the Allegheny
River through a temporary pipe-
line along Stanwix Street. After
the shell was complete and
backfilling was done, the wells
were removed and the water
table resumed its normal depth.

The Azens Building is under-
going reconstruction to house
the Wood Street Station and
some PAT offices. The ceiling
between the first and second
floors has been removed, creat-
ing a two-story street level
entrance to the station. There
will be two entrances to the sta-
tio, one each on Wood Street
and Sixth Avenue.

The building will be chemically
washed and all windows will be
replaced. The original first floor
walls have been removed and
will be replaced by glass panels
separated by granite columns.

LIBERTY AVENUE

Unlike Sixth Avenue, the
width of Liberty Avenue allowed
one way traffic during the con-
struction of the Liberty Avenue
subway shell. The decision to
locate the tunnel on the south
side of Liberty Avenue was
made to avoid the over 100,000
communication cables which
run under the north side of the
street. Other utilities such as
sewer, steam, and water were
suspended from the temporary
decking. During backfilling oper-
ations, new lines were placed
over the subway shell.

Workmen pouring concrete in the Midtown Station

GATEWAY CENTER

The Gateway Center Station
is the most simple, having only
one entrance and one platform.
The entrance/exit will ‘be
located between Gateway 4 and
the Liberty Avenue/Stanwix
Street intersection. The stairs,
escalators, and elevator lead
directly to the platfrom. The
entrance is protected by a kiosk
with a 12-foot cantelevered roof.

The ﬂoor of the station will be
steel blue brick pavers. The
walls and benches will be con-
structed of white granite with
ﬂecks of black and gray. Gate-
way Center Station is also uni-
que in that it will have no
columns. The ceiling will be flat
concrete with bright yellow baf-
fles arranged in a grid pattern
suspended from it. The platform
will be lit by cylindrical lights sus-
pended within the grid.

GENERAL

The construction costs of the
10.5 mile Light Rail Transit sys-
tem will total $559 million. The
federal government finances 80
percent, the state pays 16 and
two—thirds percent, and the
county assumes the remainder
of the costs.

The entire system was divided
into sections of approximately
$15 million each. This was done
to allow smaller local firms to
participate in the bidding.
According to Mike Scanlon, title
about 90 percent of the con-

ting off

tracts were awarded to firms
within the county.

One contract which was
awarded to an outside firm was
for the construction of 55 Light
Rail Vehicles (LRV’s). This con-
tract, worth $55 million, was
awarded to Siemans-Duwag
Corporation of West Germany.
The LRV’s will be shipped in
parts to the Blawnox Equipment
Company for assembly. The
LRV’s $900,000 sticker price
limited the number that PAT
could purchase. Th€Y€f0r€,
both LRV’s and trolleys will
serve the subway. The familiar
sight of trolleys rumbling along
downtown streets will be only a
memory by the end of the year.

The LRV’s will seat 65 per-
sons with an additional capacity
for 200 standees. Each car in
nearly twice as long as a trolley
and will bend in the middle. Each
vehicle is both heated and air
conditioned. The LRV’s will
have folding seats which will ena-
ble wheelchair passengers to
ride with a minimum of
inconvenience.

The trolley pole on the 45
refurbished trolleys will be
replaced with a device called a
pantograph. A pantograph is a
movable frame which presses
against the trolley wire, eliminat-
ing the problem of trolleys jump-
the cable. The
refurbished trolleys will continue
service untilthey require replace-
ment around the turn of the
century.

SAFETY

Many safety features have
been incorporated into the
design of the subway. For
instance, all electrical lines in the
subway box are enclosed in a
concrete conduit which also
serves as an emergency walk-
way through the tunnels.

In case of fire in the tunnel, 13
ventilator fans spaced along the
subway route will draw smoke
and fumes one way, while pro-
viding fresh air from the other.

In case of a ﬂood in the tunnel,
massive pumps located at the
low point of the tunnel near
Wood Street will pump all the
water into the Allegheny River.

There are many safety fea-
tures in the stations. First there
are no hard, dark corners. All of
the corners have been rounded
off, providing a view of the whole
corner. There are no toilet facili-
ties in the stations, taking away a
prime area where crimes could
occur. Benches have armrests
on them which prevents anyone
from lying on them. Another
safety feature is the platforms
themselves. They were con-
structed with a crawl space so
that if someone were to fall out
onto the tracks with a vehicle
coming, there is a space to get
out of the way.

The security plans for the sta-
tions are not yet complete. They
will be patrolled by PAT police,
but Scanlon added that “it is too
early to tell if there is going to be
a policeman at each station.”

’ Other possible plans include

closed circuit television in the
stations.

OPERATIONS

The subway will more than
likely operate the same hours as
the current trolley system. The
fares will be the same as the cur—
rent system. Fares will be col-
lected on the vehicle, and
transfers will be available.

The eastern spur from Mid-
town to Penn Park will interface

with PAT’s East Busway, giving I

relatively traffic-free service
from the South Hills to the east.

A subway for Pittsburgh was
first recommended back in 1906.
It has taken some time, but
befon the year is through, this
dream will have been realized. A
walk through the completed
tunnels gives the viewer an idea
about the millions of future Pitts-
burghers that this subway will
beneﬁt

“WHAT SHOP??”
By MARIE MELITON

This is the common reply
when students are asked about
the Concourse Service Center.
This little “shop”, situated on the
ground ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union, goes without notice by
hundreds of passersby each
day.

Many are unaware of the var-
ious services offered by the Cen-
ter. Students can obtain listings
for Off—Campus Housing, bus
schedules, and general campus
information through the PIN-
POINT Information network.

The “Swap Board” and the
Hitching Post ride service are
also administered by the Center.

Paul Lindsey and Pam Sokol
are" two of the students

employed by the center. Lindsey .

stated that “not enough stu-
dents are aware of the many ser-
vices which we offer,” and
mentioned that he would like to
have some student input on
other services that are needed.

Currently the Center accepts

telephone bill payments, sells

stamps, newspapers, and enve-
lopes and provides table games
and a coin-op copy service.
Recently a discount film pro-
cessing service was added. All of
these services are for the con-
venience of the student body,
and commuters in particular.
The Concourse Service is open
Monday through Thursday, 8:00
AM - 9:00 PM, and Friday from
8:00 AM - 5:00 PM.

Shirk finishes season with ﬂourish

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

The Panther gymnasts’ 264.95-
252.25 thrashing of Slippery Rock
Friday night was the result of some
solid individual performances.

Senior Dave Smith and sopho-
more Mark Klafter tied Bob
Besong‘s team floor exercise record
as each recorded 9.65. Matt Peters
performed the other record—tyi,ng
routine as he was awarded a 9.75 on
the high bar.

Klafter and Peters combined to
establish a new team mark in the
parallel bars competition. Both
received scores of 9.4.

The third mark to fall at the
‘Rock‘ was the all-around record.
Peters bettered teammate Klafter’s
55.25 record by posting an impres-
sive sum of 55.45. .

From the outset. the Panthers
dominated. and after the first three
events (floor exercise. pommel horse
and still rings). Pitt maintained an
almost four-point advantage l34.05-
|29.l.

At the start of the meet‘s second
half, Pitt took a l—2—3 sweep in the
vaulting. Senior Frank Kratr scored
a 9.3 to take the top spot. Smith was
second (9.2) and Peters managed a
9.l. good for third.

Pitt cruised to the final event (the
high bar) by sweeping the parallel
bars. 9

On the high bar. Pitt got the top
three spots for the fourth time in the
evening. Peters led the charge by
scoring a 9.75. He was followed by
the two seniors. Smith (9.5) a-nd
Krati (9.4).

The lone disappointment of the
meet came when Klafter fell from
the high bar and failed to continue
the routine within 30 seconds.

“l lost track of the 30 seconds."

Klafter said. “When I was about to
get back on. the judge told me that
my routine was terminated. l was

7 really upset.“

Following Pitt's Peters in the all-
around competition were Kratr
(54.9) and Jeff Collins of Slippery
Rock (52.25).

Pitt hosts Penn State this week-

end at Trees Hall. The meet will be
broadcast locally on cable television

on Home Sports Entertainment
(HSE).

“The Pearl is probably better than
even I thought he was," said Thomp-
son. “I don‘t want anyone telling me
that the Pearl can't shoot."

“Each time I play against him, l
am more and more impressed."
Smith said.

But it was Ewing and his not-
always-loved or loveable teammates
who rose up to take home the silver
cup awarded to the tournament
champions. Georgetown now owns
three ofthe five Big East tournament

as a runway to the NCAAs, and they

The Pitt News

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team finished its regular season
Saturday night with a 179.65-
175.65 win over Maryland as
well as several personal best
marks for Pitt’s gymnasts.

The victory gave the Lady
Panthers a record of 8-3 and
brought a record-setting dual-
meet season to a close for the
Panthers. Pitt scored its second-
highest total of the year while
Maryland set a season high try-
ing unsuccessfully to topple the
Lady Panthers.

The meet was highlighted by
an outstanding performance by
Lisa Shirk, who, for the second
week in a row, rewrote the Pitt
individual scoring record. Shirk
broke her_own record by scoring
a 9.55 on the vault, 9.75 on the
uneven parallel bars, 9.4 on the

was breaking 38 again. It was a personal goal

for me to get over 38.’

——-Lisa Shirk

balance beam and 9.45 on the
floor exercise.

“It was not as nice breaking
the record as it was breaking 38
again. It was a personal goal for
me to get over 38," Shirk said. “A
couple of good things happened
this weekend. We were good on
the beam, which can hurt a team
if you make mistakes. This meet
really set a good mood for
regionals."

Pitt's win came after a week

that almost kept much of the "

team at home, as 'most of the
Lady Panthers came down with a
stomach virus that kept most of
the team from practicing last
week, Lady Panther coach
Donna Sanft said.

“We really were not well; we
started off on the bars and had
problems, but they really picked
up momentum on the vault,"
Sanft said.

In addition to Shirk, senior
Babbie Flock also set a personal
high —— scoring a 35.95 in the
all-around. Flock accumulated
her total with impressive scores
such as a 9.5 on the uneven paral-

lel bars. Debbie Dabkowski also

did her part by garnering a 35.50
in the all-around — scoring a 9.0
on the floor exercise.

Pitt's next competition will be
the NCAA regional meet in two
weeks at Penn State. Sanft said
that the leading teams in the
region also scored l8l or above
this weekend, but, “if we would
have had everyone, we would
have scored 181 or I82, too.”

Sanft said thegymnasts will be
concentrating on
things for regionals and it was
encouraging that her team did so
well on the balance beam this
week.

“We know we can hit bars. It
was nice we did so well on the
beam; that’s the key. to winning
regionals,” she said.

Frustrated J elic: wins

All-America honors

By Tlm Dlnger
The Pitt News

MEADOWLANDS, N.J. —— Des-
pite what he called a frustrating
tournament, Panther wrestler Jeff
Jelic earned the title of All-
American by placing fifth at the
NCAA Wrestling Championships at
the Meadowlands Arena, over the
weekend.

“The whole tournament, I didn’t
feel sharp at all.” Jelic said. “I was
ﬁghting myself a lot, and ldidn’t feel
comfortable.” .

Jelic was seeded sixth going into
the tournament. In his first prelimi-
nary match, he defeated unseeded
Rudy lsom of Wisconsin, 4-3. The
next two wins vaulted him into the
semi-finals. With just undera min-
ute to go in his second match, Jelic
hit a headlock that put his oppo-
nent, Mike DeGenova of Temple,

"out of the match, and out of the

tournament. Jelic had been beating
DeGenova who was 26-1 going into
the match, by 10 points when the
injury occured. —

In the quarter-finals, the match
that would automatically give Jelic a
6th /‘ place, third-seeded Melvin
Douglas of Oklahoma failed to
make the second weight-in, and
forfeited.

“The forfeit helped because I
didn’t have to wrestle as many
matches, so I wasn't as sore or worn
down," Jelic said. “but on the other
hand, it meant I didn't get a workout
in, so it hurt me also."

In the ‘semi-final match, he faced
second seed Lindly Kistler of Iowa,

 

who came in with a 37-5 record. Jelic
fell 8-l.

“Kistler took Jeff out of his style
of wrestling," said head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “The problem
was Jeff didn‘t get to see the kids he
wrestled during the year. I think if he
would have seen who he was wrest-
ling once during the season, it would
have helped him here."

“I wrestled his style; he’s not a real
quick kid, and he slowed me down
enough to take away my advan-
tage," said Jelic. “I walked off the
mat after seven minutes and
thought, ‘What did I do?‘ If I could
do the match over, I would have
moved a lot more and used my
quickness.”

In the first round of the consola-
tions, he met Tennessee's Chris
Edmonds, who defeated“Jelic I0-5.

Edmonds was called for stalling in
the first period, and with seconds
remaining, Jelic tried to force
another stalling call, but was thrown
to his back to fall behind 4-0.

“I don't feel like I wrestled him
well," said Jelic. “He kept blocking
me out, so I couldn’t get any offense
going.

“He's not the type of kid who goes
out to score points, and when he got
ahead early, that put me behind the
eight ball because he just sat back
and looked for my mistakes."

While trying to force Edmonds to
wrestle, Jelic was again caught in a
throw, giving up another five points
to end the match at l0-5, putting
Jelic into the fifth place bracket
against his first round foe, Isom.

Jelic repeated his victory over
lsom by scoring a last minute take-
down in the third peiod, winning 4-
3. .

Pitt’s Jeff Jelic (left) gained All-America honors at the NCAA wrestling

championships last week.

Ironically, because of the two byes
created by DeGenova‘s default and
Douglas‘ forfeit, lsom was crowned
an All-American without winning a
match at the national tournament.
Although Stottlemyer believes, like
Jelic, that he could have finished
higher, he is still very pleased with
Jelic‘s achievements at Pitt.

“It speaks for itself; he's fifth in
the country," said Stottlemyer. “He
won three Eastern Wrestling League
titles. and he's Pitt's winningest
wrestler. Not bad for a guy who

lﬁlﬁlﬁlﬁ

didn't even wrestle varsity in high
school until his senior year.

“He wasn‘t one of the most re-
cruited wrestlers around. but he
came in with a lot of talent and a
willingness to learn and work hard,
and he turned out to be a very well-
rounded individual — notjust a fine
athlete but also a fine student.“

As for Jelic, future plans concern-
ing wrestling for the moment are
being put on hold.

“Right now, I have a cold, I feel
sick and I have a lot of school work
to catch up on," he said. “I’m not
really thinking about what I’m going
to do about wrestling — there's no
way I'm going to be able to give it up
completely, but as for competing,
I'm not sure."

Reaching All-American status
was Jelic‘s second major goal that he
achieved this year. The first was real-
ized when he was accepted to Pitt's
dental school in January.

Stoudt
snowballs ‘
Maulers

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

lt was a homecoming celebration
for Birmingham quarterback Cliff
Stoudt. yesterday at Three Rivers
Stadium.

A sellout crowd invaded the sta-
dium with buttons and banners to
denounce the former Steeler quar-
terback, whose Birmingham team
romped over the Pittsburgh Maul-
ers, 30-l8.

“A lot of peoplejust flat out hate
you as a person because of a silly
game of football, and you can’t do
anything about that,” said Stoudt.

Stoudt was barraged by boo-birds
for the first five minutes ofthe game,
until their voices grew weary and
they opted for an alternative weapon

snowballs.

“They were great,

us

said Maulers

General Manager George Heddle—
ston of the boisterous crowd. “I
don't know about the snowball
throws, though. I thought their
throws were as bad as the quarter-

sideline during Sunday’s game against the Pittsburgh Maulers. ~ Stoudt completed just two of to
passes for 29 yards. forcing the Stal-
lions to rely on running back Joe
Cribbs for their offensive thrust.
Cribbs rushed 33 times for l9l
yards, including two touchdowns.

“He's one heck of a . running
back.“ said Maulers Coach Joe
Pendry. whose team is now 0-3 in the
United States Football League.
“There‘s no doubt about that. He
made a lot of people miss tackles.“

Maulers defensive end Sam
Clancy. some 50 pounds sturdier
than he was as a Pitt basketball star
from 1978-81. was very impressed by
Cribbs.

“He's got to be one of the best
three backs l‘ve ever played
against." said Clancy. who made five
tackles. “He’s elusive. he's quick.
and hejust knows the game real well.

“I know for myself. Many times I
had him wrapped up. at least l
thought I did. and next thing you
know he was open for a first down."

Quarterback Glenn Carano con-
nected on 18 of 33 pass attempts for
22l yards in the Maulers‘ home
opener. Carano threwjust one inter-
ception, which Birmingham safety
Chuck Clanton raced 53 yards with
for his team‘s first score.

Running back Mike Rozier
gained 52 yards on Io carries. “I
think l’m getting better and better,"
he said."l still got some work to do;
l‘m not gonna say I'm perfect right
now. l‘m just doing the best I can
right now."

The referees were Pittsburgh's
worst enemies yesterday. as they
doled out eight penalties for bl yards
against the Maulers. The scenario
played havoc with Coach Pendry's
game scheme.

“We'd either stop them and get a
penalty and they‘d proceed the drive
going or we'd have the penalty to
stop ourselves," Pendry said.

The Maulers defense thwarted
Birmingham‘s first two offensive
plays successive runs by Cribbs
but a roughing—the—passer call
against Clancy on third—and—l()
allowed the Stallions to gain
momentum. ‘

“We got down so fast." said
Carano. an ice—paCk secured to his
bruised back with Ace bandages.
“When you go down that fast like
that, it’s tough coming back. We
came back a little bit. We have to
learn to put the football in the end
zone a little better."

Maulers rookie Tony Lee booted
28-yard and 42-yard field goals.
Pittsburgh tacked on two fourth-
quarter touchdowns a 4-yard toss
from Carano to Shawn Potts and a
l-yard burst by Walt Easley. ;

“I think right now we‘re down.“
said linebacker Ron Crosby. “lt‘s
the home opener and we wanted to
show the fans that we could play
quality football. l‘m really frus-
trated. but we're gonna come back.“

anther netters
ain experience
espite big losses

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News '

After winning all nine matches on
Thursday, the Panther tennis team
received the same treament it dished
out to Maryville from Middle Ten-
nessee State, Tennessee-

0 Chattanooga and Trevecchia

College in the finale of a weekend
tour of the South. .

Pitt was shutout twice while man-
aging to win only two matches
against Trevecchia.

Winning, however, was not the
sole purpose of taking the trip. The
three teams to which Pitt lost heavily
recruit from around the world, but
the Panthers manage to form a
mixed squad of recruits and walk-
ons. The idea of the tour was to
receive exposure against quality
competition, and that was achieved.

“We went‘ up against real good

teams,“ Panther coach George Dief-P

fenbach said. “Under these circum-
stances, you work on where you
have to improve. You have to put
things in perspective.“

One area in which Pitt needs
improvement is consistency. An
example of this was in the Trevec-
chia match. While Pitt employs a
serve-and-volley style of play in

which rallies rarely last past four
shots, Trevecchia, with the top three
spots headed by Swedish imports,
takes the type of game countrymen
Bjorn Borg made famous  the
patient, heavy top spin, baseline to
baseline style. The results showed as
Pitt's top three players ~— Dave
Johnson, Larry Lederer and Jack
Kalla ~- all lost in straight sets as
only No.6 six player Chuck DeVera
and the No. 3 doubles team of Paul
Rodriquez and Rich Monteleone
managed victory the entire quad
meet.

“The fact that [Telle Norkstrom,
Trevecchia‘s No. 2 player] was
incredibly consistent hurt me.” Led-
erer said. ‘‘I‘m used to going against
power players.

“They don't have to power the
ball: they can place the ball within

three or four inches of where they
want it.“

Now, the Panthers can make the
improvements necessary to have the
winning record Dieffenbach wants.
Pitt will have to opportunity this
Saturday morning as it faces Buck-

,nell at ll a.m.

Pitt's Roger Kingdom won his second straight
NCAA national hurdle title. He sprinted over the
55-meter strip of 42 inch barriers in a time of 7.08

“We have to cut down on our mis-
takes," Lederer said. “If we do, we
will be competitive with teams in the
Northeast."

The Pitt'News, Monday, March 12,1984

~.v-at-,

Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim (against wall) explains a decision to the media

interview.

By Charlie O’Hara
The Pitt News

NEW YORK CITY — Syracuse
basketball coach Jim Boeheim for-
got about how much fun the Big
East conference tournament was
supposed to be Saturday night fol-
lowing his team's heartwrenching
82-71 overtime loss to Georgetown
in the championship game.

Boeheim stormed into the press

_room at Madison Square Garden
.for the post-game conference and

flat out castigated the three—man
official crew ofJody Sylvester, Dick

, Paparo and Larry Lambo for what

he called “the worst series ofcalls“ in
his eight years as head coach of the
Orangemen.

“I have one thing to say,’
Boeheim said. “My kids did every-
thing possible tonight. but the refs
purely and simply took the game
away from us. [Michael] Graham
threw a punch at my player, and the
ref had the nerve to only call it a
two-shot foul. The ref didn‘t have
the guts to call the right call!"

\

The disgusted Boeheim then
threw the chair he was sitting on
against the wall behind the confer-
ence table in a final non-verbal fury.

The “series" of questionable calls
began with 3:52 to go in regulation
with the Orangemen holding a 57-54
advantage.

Syracuse center Andre Hawkins
pulled down a missed Hoya shot,
was fouled from behind by a Geor-
getown player and then punched by
the Hoya freshman Graham after
attempting to clear out the three
second area by way of throwing his
elbows around.

Immediately following the punch.
Paparo ran directly in front of Gra-
ham and threw his thumb up in the
air several times to declare ejection.

During a post-game interview,
Paparo said, “I didn‘t intend it to
mean ejection if that's what I did.“

There were clearly two different
calls made —— one for the foul on the
rebound and another when Graham
threw the punch.

This meant that Syracuse should
have had an opportunity to shoot
four free throws. one-on-one for the

rebounding foul and two for the
obvious ﬂagrant technical foul. In
addition, the Orangemen should
have been given the ball out of
bounds after the technical foul
shots.

The final decision by the officials
was to simply call the incident a two-
shot intentional foul by Graham and
no ejection.

“We wanted to make sure we were
in total agreement on the call.“ head
official Sylvester said.

“I heard two separate whistles.
and you don't blow your whistle
unless you have a call." Boeheim
said. “The second whistle came after
he punched him. He had already
called the other foul.

“John Thompson [Georgetown‘s
coach] and I had a conversation at
half court. and he said I had the right
call."

Thompson made a concerted
effort to avoid discussion of the
incident.

“I didn‘t hear what Coach
Boeheim said, but in a game like
this. things get hot, and I can under-
stand his reactingthis way."Thomp-

Tim M0er.s'h/ The Pit! News .4

in a post game

Boeheim incensed by officiating

son said. “I don‘t think the game was
given to us by any stretch of the
imagination." -

Boeheim, despite the officialjudg-
ments that hampered his team.
maintained that the crew calling the
game was the best in the conference.

With less than 3:00 to go in regula-
tion, the Orangemen were far from
finished. still holding a bl-56 lead.

But when Syracuse point guard
Dwayne Washington was called for
five seconds without crossing the
hash mark in the backeourt and cen-
ter George Papadakos was called for
traveling in the three-second area.
what was once a til-56 lead had
quickly become a bl-bl tie and even-
tually an overtime loss for the
Orangemen.

“The call on Dwayne was a quick
call." Boeheim said. “And then there
was the call on Papadakos. and I
know he had the ball dribbled in
time.

“It was the series ofcalls down the
stretch that took the game away."

Hoyas
overcome
Syracuse,
82-7 1

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

NEW YORK They have been the fre-
quent recipients of boos hissed about and
often maligned for their aggressive style of
play. On Saturday night in the finals of the
Big East Conference tournament champion-
ship, they were given a welcome deserving of
tax collectors and insurance repossessers.

The Georgetown Hoyas received a good
scare, but in the end, they seemed more than
able to avoid one thing defeat.

When the chanting and screaming had
finished. by thetime l9.95l Madison Square
Garden fans had been reduced to brooms
and empty Pepsi cups. Patrick Ewing and
the rest of those...those...those Hoyas had
done it again. The bad guys in oyster grey
beat the brightness out of the Syracuse
Orangemen 82-71.

All sentiments aside. Georgetown (29-3)
walked away from the Big Apple having
taken another big bite out of their competi-
tion, and while it took a questionable series
of calls and an overtime period to accomp-
lish it. the Hoyas did what every other Big
East team came to do win the Big East
tournament championship.

Georgetown, however has little time for
savoring with the big party. the NCAA tour-
nament. waiting ahead this week. The Hoyas
were seeded as the top team in the West

when the tournament pairings were.

Miami (Ohio) and Southern Methodist

lanova and St. Johns. also made the field of
54 teams that will play their way toward
Seattle. home of this year‘s championship.

The Syracuse Orangemen came into the
final two rounds of last week‘s tournament
carrying a transplanted version of their
home court Carrier Dome atmosphere.
Aside from the lingering smell of good times
and toasts to “ole SU.” the most evident
thing in and around Madison Square
Garden for two days was the color orange.

By Saturday. local favorite St. Johns had
fallen to Georgetown. and their hopes of a
National Collegiate Athletic Association bid
looked dim. When the Hoyas came on to the
court Saturday. cahbies from Queens and
account executives from the upper west side
alike had shifted the color of their allegian-
ces. What was once all red had become
orange for the night. and frustrations of
defeat became the hopes of seeing those
...those...those Hoyas get beat right on
national television.

Those hopes came as close as the width of
a basketball rim when Syracuse senior Sean
Kerins‘ last-second shot hit the iron and
bounced away to end regulation play. The
score stood at 03-03. The top two teams
coming into the tournament had exchanged
their best basketball of the season for 40
minutes and still neither could decide which
was best.

Georgetown cleared up any confusion in
the five minute overtime period that
followed.

Junior Patrick Ewing assumed control by
winning the overtime tap. And just 30

’’I think reading, if done properly, is

Ragtime was devoured by the public
when it came out in 1975.

He is talking about his first job
(after college, one year at Columbia
and a two—year stint in the army) as a
reader for a motion picture company.
Doctorow read almost a book a day
for three years. He had to synopsize
each book then deliver an opinion on
its suitability for motion picture
adaptation. ’’It was a wonderful

learn about structure, about how
books are put together, how stories

Why only one year in graduate
school? ”I think, instinctively, I must

  Gordon Lish: Ghostwriter Visible .

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Although Gordon Lish has
authored 18 books, he had his first
novel published only last year.

That is, the first novel that bore his
real name.

Lish has ghost—written a large
number of novels and three biogra-
phies, but the highly-acclaimed Dear
Mr. Capote, published in 1983 by Holt,
Rinehart and Winston, was the first
one on which his real name was used.

The 50-year-old Lish decided to
end his many years of anonymity
with Dear Mr. Capote because, he says,
”my vanity finally got the best of me"'

"I think it's fair to say that I've
made enough money as a ghost-
writer tobe able to write a book that I
really wanted to," he says, explaining
that he wasn't afraid to take the
chance that Dear Mr. Capote would fail
financially.

Lish says that the books that he's
ghost-written were of ”a general
nature,” and he'll publicly admit to
writing only one of them — Coming
Out Of The Ice, the autobiography of
Victor Herman, a U.S. citizen who
was held against his will in the
U.‘S.S.R. for 45 years. Lish
unabashedly says that the book was
well-written and caught the interest
of many, including CBS, which made
the book into a TV movie starring
John Savage and Ben Cross. Lish,
none too pleased with the movie, says

knowing it, from an early age will
read for the excitement and thrill ofit
and the journey of going through a
book, but also with a developing
capacity to identify with the author
and the way the author works."

How does this author work? He is
known, among other things, for the
skill and style with which he can vi-
vidly create a place or time, a place in
time, the people in that place -— all, of
course, effortlessly, while telling a
complex, compelling story at the
same time. But, Doctorow maintains,
"in my experience, you don't really
know when you start, when the work
is going good, exactly what you're
aiming for. You have the start of the
vlaguest presumptions, a feeling, an
image or some kind of excitement at-
tached you don't even know to what.
And as you pursue this, you find out
what your story is or what you're
interested in,~and after you have 50
or 100 or 150 pages, you see what
your premises are. That's when the
editorial faculty comes into play very
usefully. You begin to organize the
work around its own intentions that
you've discovered, and then you
function simultaneously as a writer
and editor on through the end of the
book." -

Those editorial faculties told Doc-
tgorow that he was doing something
wrong 150 pages into the first ver-
sion of what was to become his
second novel, The Book of Daniel. (His
jirst novel, Welcome to Hard Times, was
published in 1960.) Fortunately, he
found the narrator he needed in
Daniel; the result is the superb and
wrenching novel that received the
National Book Award Nomination in
1971. .

"It is a work of the imagination:
what would it be like to be a son (and
brother of the daughter) of people
like the Rosenbergs, a son living in
the late 1960s with various planes of

In Literary World

”a terrible job" was done translating
the book into a film.

Surprisingly, Lish, recipient of the
Pushcart Prize for "How To Write A
Poem," is not a novelist by profes-
sion; he makes his day-to-day living
as an editor for Alfred A. Knopf Pub-
lishing, a position he has held since
1977. For the eight years prior to
that, he worked as fiction editor for
Esquire and wrote dozens of articles
under various pseudonyms.

After having been on both sides of
the /desk — as an editor and as an
author — Lish says he didn't find that
the two overlapped in any significant
way.

"I don't feel a great deal of learning
follows you from one_job to another,"
he says. "I don't think any experien-
ces I've had on one side of the desk
would have any bearing _on my
behavior as a person on the other side
of the desk."

, Lish's experiences did overlap,
however, in his style of writing and
editing.

”I'm a most exacting editor. That's
a good kind to be if you're dealing
with an unexacting writer," he says,
explaining that he demands quality

the past constantly intersecting the
present," one reviewer wrote.

When Ragtime was published in
1975, it turned Doctorow into a best-
‘selling author; it also ‘won the
National Book Critics Circle Award.
This elegant yet kaleidoscopic view of
turn-of-the-century America fea-
tures everyone from Emma Goldman
to Evelyn Nesbit and from ].P. Mor-
gan to Sigmund Freud. "That E.L.
Doctorow was a geniune experimen-
talist ldid not doubt,"wrote Anthony
Burgess in the Saturday Review. "The
aim of Ragtime was as purely aesthetic
as that of Ulysses: the joy lay in the
manipulations of the crassvelements
of history." . A

The word "experimentalist" fore-
shadowed some of the .controversy
surrounding Doctorow's most recent
novel, Loon Lake. Dazzling, tantalizing,
exhilirating, engrossing, haunting,
challenging, innovative and ambi-
tious are just a few of the adjectives
used to describe this odd saga of a
young man's journey across Depres-
sion America. For while Publishers
Weekly called Loon Lake ”a splendid
achievement," reactions were not all
favorable. One reviewer's "bracing
technical liberation" is another man's
"experiment" -—— and ”experiment," to
many, is a dirty word.

Loon Lake has been accused of lack-
ing everything from coherence to
subtlety or movement of character to
regular punctuation. The novel has
been labeled irritating, difficult,
derivative (most often of john Dos
Passos but also ofloyce, Faulkner and
Stein) and just plain unsuccessful.
There is no final consensus: equally
celebrated critics sit on either side of
the fence. For some, it is worthwhile
to sift through the fragments and
struggle with shifting narration; for
others, it is ultimately too much trou-
ble to try to plumb this book's depths.

"I have heard pretty good interpre-
tations of various of my works," says

and accuracy from other writers and
from himself.

Lish's accomplishments read like a
listing in Who's Who In /imerim, and, in
fact, he is included in that prestigious
publication. After graduating from

 
   

Gordon Lish

the Univerity of Arizona after only

two years, he taught English at both

the high school and college level.
After working several years in edu-

cational and behavorial research set-

Doctorow, "and as long as they don't
claim to be exhaustive, I tend to
embrace them. I do not think l'm the
final authority on what I've done in
terms of what it means." Doctorow is
firmly grounded in the New Criti-
cism —. he studied with john Crowe
Ransom as an undergraduate at
Kenyon College —— but there's
another impulse as well behind that
statement. The basic sense of fair
play is extremely important to Doc-
torow, whether the issue is merely
tolerating different critical view-
points or considering what should
happen to the children of a couple
that is convicted of conspiring to give
away America's atomic secrets. Doc-
torow has said of himself that he is
"extremely sensitive to the idea of
injustice. The idea that something is
not fair really gives me energy in
writing."

Doctorow's is a careful justice; he
will not provide a direct answer to the
question ”Which contemporary writ-
ers do you read?" Instead, he talks
about the books he is using for a
course he will teach at New York Uni-
versity this spring, The Craft of Fic-
tion. (Ironically, he admits, teaching
has caught up with him after all.)
”The choice of novels here is careful,"
he says, ”but it's not exclusive. I don't
think acts of exclusion should be per-
formed. Literature is not a horse race;
you don't look for a winner. Really, it
is a multiplicity of witness you're
soliciting as a reader....For me, I don't
think life could be lived without liter-
ature. It's not a taste, it's not an affec-
tion. It's an absolute need. It's what
composes existence, and so, the more
contributers to the composition, it
seems to me, the closer we can dream
of coming to the truth."

Happily, E.L. Doctorow continues
his contributions: his new book, Lives
of the Poets (a novella and six. stories),
will be published by Random House
in. the fall.

tings, Lish took a job with Esquire. He

was fired when the magazine
changed hands because of a disagree-
ment with the new publisher; Knopf
hired him the same day.

While he was with Knopf, he wrote
Dear Mr. Capote, a macabre look into
the mind of a killer stalking women in
New York City. The murderer won't
stop killing until he reaches the 47th
victim —— his age, and the age Lish was
when he wrote the novel.

Lish says he thought of the idea
while thumbing through an edition
of the New York Daily News. He came
across an advertisement for a book,
written by a murderer, in which he
explains and details his crimes.

"Those [people] connected with the
advertisement were all quite proud of
the events that shaped this book," he
says. "What a way to make a living:
kill people, write a book about it and
make money for it."

Lish admits that he's enthralled
with the idea of writing about a killer
— a fascination he shares with
Capote and Norman Mailer, who is
also mentioned from time to time in
the book. Lish claims that his fascina-
tion with violence is nothing out of
the ordinary and says that most peo-
ple share it.

While Capote's In Cold Blood and
Mailer's The Exerutionefs Song were
based on real-life people and events,
Lish chooses to create fiction, saying
that he's too "chicken-hearted" to
actually pursue a real criminal.

Dear Mr. Capote, being his first novel

‘in a sense, was easy to publish. Des-

pite what most people believe, Lish
says that it's easier for an author to
publish his or her first novel than
subsequent ones because both the
writer and the editor have made an
emotional commitment to it.

”Editors are, as a rule, more hospit-
able to first novels, contrary to com-
mon report," he says. "I think the
editor of a first novel and the author
of a first novel have their hearts more
greatly in it...I think they are closer to
each other in overall feeling.’-’

Lish says the first-time novelist can
"get away with murder" because he
or she knows that something has to
be said and, in addition to being able
to say it in a precise manner, the new
novelist has a fresh approach to the
art.

Lish has been called one of the best
editors in the country today by wri-
ters and other editors alike in the
publishing world. He doesn't hesitate
to agree with that opinion and adds
that he's a "fussy" editor.

It's not a particular skill that makes
him good, he says, but that he has a
gift for it: "It's not a question of assi-
duity, so much as the function of
love, dedication, devotion and
determination."

Lish is noncommital when asked if
being in competition with the people
he edits creates a conflict of interest.
He says most of the writers he edits
have been silent about his success
with Dear Mr. Capote, and he says he
can't blame them. Several of them,
however, did praise him for his work.

Bruce Dobler, an assistant profes-
sor of English at Pitt, had a chance to
work with Lish before he left Esquire.
He, too, says that Lish is "extraordi-
nary as an editor."

He's one of those rare editors who
gives his life to what he does," Dobler
says, ”and winds up giving more than
he receives." He saysLish is devoted
to his writers and takes all the time
necessary on a book to get the best
output. /

. Pulitzer-Winning Poet
Inspired By Students

By MICHAEL CHABON

Everyone who has heard of Maxine
Kumin seems to have heard some-
thing about Maxine Kumin. This is
because Maxine Kumin is a myth.

A‘ The mythical Maxine Kumin, the
”Roberta Frost" Maxine Kumin, lives

in rural New Hampshire with
Amanda, her "sensible strawberry
roan”; with her 80-year-old neigh-
bor, Henry Manley, who stubbornly
struggles with his memory and his
failing health; among mushrooms
and stillborn foals; both menaced and
saved by fields, flowers, the coming
of April and solitude. And the myth
of Maxine Kumin is linked, by friend-
ship, with the better—known, more
sensational myth of Anne Sexton.

The mythical Maxine Kumin, of
course, is the "Maxine Kumin" who
speaks in the poems, who, through
her speech, returns again and again,
even when in the city, to the farm in
Warner, New Hampshire, and the
land and animals around it. It is the
sharp eye, skilled tongue and the
obsessiveness with which the poet
has treated her locale and daily life
that have led to the creation of this
enduring, imaginary New Hampshire
countryside and its solitary famous
poet.

Kumin is the author of seven books
of poetry, including Our Ground Time
Here Will Be Brief (1982), which con-
tains selections from all her previous
books, and Up Country (1972), which
was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in
1973. She also has written five novels
and many books for children. She did
not begin to write poetry seriously
until after she was married, had had
children and received her master's
degree from Radcliffe. In the mid
'50s, she enrolled in a poetry work-
shop at the Boston Center for Adult

Joseph

By LESLIE BENNETT

Maintaining two separate and suc-
cessful careers as poet and lawyer,
Lawrence Joseph follows in the tradi-
tion of Walt Whitman, Wallace Stev-
ens and William Carlos Williams,
who, in addition to having been well-
known poets, also held the profes-
sions of editor, lawyer and physician,
respectively.

As a poet, Joseph won the 1982
Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize
for his first book of poems, Shouting /it
No One. His manuscript was chosen
out of 450 submissions to win the
$1,000 cash prize and publication by
the University of Pittsburgh Press in
the spring of 1983. As a lawyer, some
of his achievements include serving
as law clerk to the Michigan Supreme
Court and as a consultant to the
Commission on Courts of the Michi-
gan State Senate. He also taught at
the University of Detroit School of
Law. Currently, he practices law in
New York City.

Although the enormous amount of
work of his two professions engages
him in what some would call conflict,

‘Joseph describes his situation as

"temperamentally suitable."
"They're conflicts with which I've

' lived a long time and which I've

resolved with various amounts of

Education, which was led by poet
John Holmes. In the course of this
seminar, she met Anne Sexton,
another self—described "housewife,"
and their friendship lasted until Sex-
ton's death in 1974. In ”Apostrophe
to a Dead Friend (on being interviewed by
her ln'ographer)," Kumin writes touch-
ingly of trading dresses, of "those
afternoons we lay in the sun by the
pond...the distances we leapt in
poems" but concludes:
"How it was with you now
hardly more vivid than how
it is without you..."

Like many poets, Kumin is also a
teacher; Our Ground Time Here Will Be
Brief is partially dedicated to her stu-
dents. Presently, she is leading two
workshops at MIT. She says that she
teaches only "from time to time" and

...it she is "sort of a floater." "I like it
that way because I don't feel as
though I have as much responsibility
to a faculty and to go to meetings and
so on." The fact that she teaches only
when, and because, she wants to teach
is evidence for the fact that she has
found teaching a poetry workshop to
be a valuable experience not only for
her students, but for herself. ”Some—
times, if you're lucky, you gain the
support and comfort of a good group
of bright young people," she says. "I
don't know if this helps my poetry,
but it helps my state of mind; and
then by extension, maybe that helps
the poetry. It's a very reaffirming
experience to have a group where the
psychodynamics are right and eve-
rybody is working diligently and with
excitement. It generates a kind of
excitement that washes over
everybody."

Something Kumin emphasizes in
her workshops is practice in the for-
mal aspects of poetry. Much of her
own work is formal rather than free

Maxine Kumin

verse. Although she allows that "not
everybody is equipped to work in
rhyme...there are a lot of poets who
are put off by it and are not comforta-
ble with it," she still feels that student
poets should experience the trials of,
say, putting together a sonnet. "Even
if you vow never to write a formal
poem in the course of your serious
work, still, you have to know what
you're in revolt against, and I don't
know any other way to find that out."

Among her works, there is the
short series of "Hermit Poems,"
records of some time in the life of a
man completely alone. It is difficult to
avoid identifying the persona of the
Hermit with that of the poet herself,
and indeed, Kumin is a confirmed
advocate of solitude. Unlike other
iobs, she says, writing must be done
alone; the act of writing itself
involves no kind of social intercourse.
”It's the solitary instinct that gives
rise to the writer," she says.Or, as she
writes in "The Hermit Goes Up
Attic," "The hermit carves his own
name in the sill/that someone after
will take stock of him."

Yet Kumin does not feel that the
writer cannot lead a "normal" life. "I
really think that the age of the poets
maudit —-— the alienated Lowell, Jarrell,
Berryman, the poet who saw himself
as so special, so outside and above his
society...the kind of Raskolnikov of
the poetry world —— that age is thank-
fully behind us," she says.

When told that Calway Kinnell
(another Pulitzer poet), who was a
visiting professor at Pitt last semes-
ter, delivered a lecture in which he
expressed anxiety about the fate of
poetry in a world where language
seems to have become terribly
debased, Kumin quietly disagrees. "I
think that whatever the dialect and
whatever the culture, there has
always been poetry, and I think that
as long as there are people, there will
be poems." Kumin says that she feels
"sanguine" about the fate of poetry in
1984 but adds that she is "less san-
guine about the fate of the world. I
think that if there's going to be a 1985
and a 1990 and a year 2000, there will
be good poems."

success," he says. "I find myself
maybe spending more time than I
should working, but I have a way of
writing poems that I manage to fit
into my other career."

loseph was born in Detroit in 1948
and graduated from the University of

Lawrence i]¢s'ef;H

Michigan Law School 11 years ago.
The grandson of Lebanese and Syrian
Catholic immigrants, he was one of
the few in his family to receive any
college education. His career in poet-
ry began to develop as an undergrad-
uate at the University of Michigan

where he received a Major Hopwood
Award for Poetry as well as a Power
Foundation Fellowship to study liter-

ature at the Magdalene College of
England's Cambridge University. It
was there, in earning a B.A. and an
M.A. with Honours in English Lan-
guage and Literature, that Joseph
decided that the best way to be poet
for him would be to pursue an addi-
tional, separate profession. As a
result, he returned to the University
of Michigan to attend law school.

"My choices to become and to
remain a lawyer are primarily influ-
enced by the effect law has on my
poetry," says Joseph.

The content of the poems in Shout-
ing At No One, many of which involve
the urban condition of Detroit's
industrial landscapes, seems to con-
vey Joseph's expressed need to com-
prehend his environment as an
environment faced by modern-day
people. He arrives at a point of per-
sonal understanding in his meta-
phoric use of the collective "I."

I bend
Over the machine. Heat
/Ind oil

Tune my inner ear.

"It's not the personal as much as it's
the larger ‘I’ that is confronting an
environment that seems like Detroit
but has become a metaphor fora kind
of environment that is a reality in our

century," he says. The particular
poem from which the book's title is
taken — "It's Not Me Shouting At No
One" -— reveals this sense in which
the "I" becomes Everyone and
Anyone surrounded by the harsh
realities of urban life.

Having recently moved to New
York City, Joseph is now dealing with
an environment in which he believes
the social and moral issues are differ-
ent but not so different as to be
problematic.

"My having tried to understand
Detroit, I think, complements my
perspective of New York," he says.
”When I say 'Detroit'and'New York,’
I mean it in the metaphorical sense. If
not, I would be writing journalism,
and I'm certainly not interested in
doing that."

Although Joseph has never taught
poetry, he emphasizes the potential
and important value of creative- and
poetry-writing courses.

"They provide an environment in
which poetry is taken seriously and in
which attitudes toward poetry are
discussed and developed," he says.
But for Joseph, writing is more a
question of dedication.

"It's kind of an essential impulse to
write poetry rather than to be a poet.

. My advice to a young poet would be

to follow that impulse."

Ward Uses Novel Idea For Movie 0

By RICHARD SATER

A picture is worth a thousand
words; such is the appeal of cinema,
embellishing language with visual
accompaniment. Novelist and
screenwriter Robert Ward experien-
ces the best of two distinct worlds. In
the case of Cattle Annie and Little
Britches, Ward enjoyed the apparent
luxury of adapting his own material
for the screen.

Films developed from novels rarely
capture the scope of their source mat-
ter, but who better than its author
could transfer the essence of a book
to the screenplay? Ward found the
process educational, although hardly
aesthetically satisfying. ”An incredi-
ble amount of business decisions take
precedence over artistic decisions in
movie-making," he says.

Ward's Cattle Annie bases itself on
fact —— the title figures are two teen-
age girls who join the remnants of the
notorious Doolin-Dalton gang in the
18905, providing innocent distraction
and cover for the crew's exploits.
”They were mean-looking little girls
...they looked like kids I had grown up
with in Baltimore," says Ward.

”These girls were bored," he con-
tinues. "They lived in Guthrie, Okla.,
and they wanted to have some fun.
They read dime novels by Ned Bunt-
line —— outrageously enlarged yellow
journalism stories about the Doolin-
Dalton gang and their many heroic
and fantastic exploits. These girls
went to a barn dance, and there the
gang was...so [the girls] asked could
they be in the gang.

”The girls were deeply disap-
pointed when they met up with the
gang, because they were not heroic-
looking like Ned Buntline had written
about them. They were just a bunch
of sodbusters who were just about on
their last legs,” says Ward. Annie and
Little Britches joined with intent to
reform — to spur the gang to further
glory.

The novel paints a charming por-
trait of a volatile relationship
between two girls —— the man-of-
action Annie and the more reflective
Little Britches. Ward spent approxi-
mately three and a half years on the
book, a rather traditional Western in
terms of its approach. Research at
several Western libraries, including
that of the University of Oklahoma,
provided the facts.

Ward wrote the novel and the
screenplay for Cattle Annie and Little
Britches simultaneously and "com-
pletely on speculation,” he says, gam-
bling on the chance that there would
be a demand for it. Having no script-
writing experience, Ward read Citizen
Kane, the Orson Welles-Herman
Mankiewicz scenario, several times.
A good model film, Kane contained
”everything" that Ward might find
necessary; the King—Hitzig Produc-
tion Company bought his completed
script almost immediately —- a rare
bit of luck.

The resulting film, directed by
Lamont Johnston, starred Burt Lan-
caster as the aging Bill Doolin, Scott
Glenn as Bill Dalton, Amanda
Plummer as Annie and Diane Lane as
Britches. In its original form, the
screenplay for Cattle Annie followed its
source closely. ”Then it went
through the multitudinous changes"
required by the producer and finan-
cial backers, Ward says. ”In the final
analysis, the book and the movie are
very dissimilar."

The focus of the novel, the rela-
tionship of the title pair, becomes
secondary in the film, which concen-
trates instead on the Doolin-Dalton
side —- its major flaw, according to
Ward. But Hollywood dictates that
”you can't make a film about two girls
and their friendship," he says. Since
Plummer and Lane were unknown
when cast in the film, box-office male
stars were added to draw the
audience. The story was rerouted to
accommodate Lancaster.

 

CATTLE ANNIE

Robert Ward

Other writers were brought in to
doctor Ward's script, and he found it
necessary to distance himself from
the job. "For the most part, you
become expendable pretty quickly,"
he says, generalizing an author's role
in the screenwriting process.

The film, released in 1980, received
no distribution. "Universal decided it
was just going to be a loser, I think,"
Ward says, although the reviews
indicated favor (Rolling Stone included
the picture among the year's 10 best).
Ward liked the movie on its own, par-
ticularly the performances. Although
the actors were not portraying his
novel's characters as written, ”I think
they were wonderful in the picture.
They certainly caught the spirit of
what I wanted to do, if not the letter
of it."

Something of a cowboy himself —
at least in spirit — Robert Ward grew
up in Baltimore with various and
imaginative futures in mind. "My
plan was to hitchhike around the
world and marry a sultan's daughter;
I got to India, and I couldn't get in to
see him," says Ward with gravity. He
considered football briefly — ”I
wanted to be quarterback of the
Colts, but I couldn't throw the ball
more than 25 yards down the line" —
but turned to writing as an
alternative.

He composed his first short story
in the fourth grade, and "somebody
told me it was good. They created a
monster."

College — reluctantly — meant
Towson State College for his under-
graduate years and the University of

Arkansas for a master's degree. He
played in a rock band for a short time,
did some teaching for seven years
(”that was long enough") and pub-
lished his first novel, the humorous
and partly autobiographical Shedding
Skin, in 1972. Cattle Annie and Little
Britches appeared in 1977, and a
thriller, The Sandman, two years later.
Ward considers his most recent work
—- Red Baker, a novel about unem-
ployed steelworkers coping in Balti-
more, which took three years to
complete and will be published in
1985 — his best.

Although he considers himself
primarily a novelist, Ward relies on
his "New Journalism, which I do for
just about everybody," including Rol-
ling Stone, Penthouse and Centlemen'5
Quarterly, for his steadiest source of
income while writing novels. His
non-fiction profiles and short stories
have appeared in various publications
as well.

He remains quite profitably active
in script-writing for television and
movies, having completed an as—yet—
unused situation comedy pilot for
ABC. Negotiations with Universal
Studios for a minor league football
comedy entitled Off Sides are in
progress.

Serious novels do not pay, says
Ward. "You better know how to do
other things" — a succinct statement
that serves as an appropriate phi-
losphy. In summary, Robert Ward --
novelist, screenwriter, journalist,
some-time teacher, traveler and
musician —- follows his rule.

Although at first glance it might
seem discouraging for a new writer
to break into the literary world, pub-
lication through small presses can be
a solution.

This year, the eighth annual Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Writers’ Con-
ference will focus on some of the
small and trade presses. An oppor-
tunity to become more familiar with
some of the local small presses will be
provided at the small press book fair
that will be held in the William Pitt
Union.

”Letting the public become aware
of the fact that there are other alter-

natives to the trade or commercial
presses and letting people see what
we do and explaining what we do is
one of the benefits [of participating in
the conference small press fairl," Pat

. Petrosky of Slow Loris Press, one of

the participants in the fair, said.

The following are some of the
small presses and literary magazines
that will be present to answer ques-
tions and sell their published
material:

0 Antioch Review

0 Backspace Literary Magazine

0 Carnegie-Mellon University
Press in conjunction with The Three
Rivers Poetry journal

0 University of Pittsburgh Press

There is a wide spectrum of pub-
lishers — from the small press and
university press to the trade press.
The distinction between them is an
important one. A trade press is a
major publishing house that handles
the marketing of published works on
a larger scale.

A university press publishes mate-
rials compiled for doctoral theses and
other scholarly works, as well as
some poetry and fiction. University
presses operate on a smaller level,

Small Presses: The Visions Of Individuals

handling a small portion of the publi-
cation business. ~

"The small press serves as an alter-
native to the trade or commercial
press,” Petrosky said. "It's something
that is run by one or two people, or
sometimes by a collection of people,
who are responsible for all aspects of
getting out the final product." Many
times, operation is out of someone's
home or a small office.

Small presses are ”the visions of
individuals," according to Doug Cur-
rier of the University of Pittsburgh's
English writing department, a pub-
lished poet in a variety of small press
publications.

The trade press is concerned about
a large turn—over for the works that
are published, which results in profit.
The small press, on the other hand,
may not Show a profit at all because,
in most cases, money earned circu-
lates back into the business to cover
publishing costs. ”Small presses
become big business when profits
become an important factor," Currier
said. Pushcart Press, the editor of
which will be featured in the confer-
ence, recognizes the importance of
small press contributions in Thv Push-
mrt Prize, an annual compilation of the
best of small presses.

The most prestigious of the small
presses are associated with colleges
and universities. An example of this

 

is the University of Pittsburgh Press,
which publishes about 30 books a
year on the average, one-fourth
being works of poetry and the
remainder being scholarly works.
The university press also serves as an
example of an operation that returns
nearly all of its profit to the press to
cover publishing costs.

In many cases, small presses will
not draw enough of a profit to meet
the publishing cost, which forces
them to operate precariously on a
month-to—month basis.

Consequently, grants are vital to
the continuation of many small
presses. However, in order to be eligi-
ble, the press must stay in existence
for at least two years.

Slow Loris Press is one example of
a small press that received a grant
this year. ”We have a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts for
a reprinting of a book of fiction that
was done in a limited edition called
’The House That lack Built,’ ”
Petrosky said.

Many of the other grants available
come from the National Endowment
for the Arts for continued publica-
tion. The Howard Heinz Endowment
is another contributor.

”The novel is a money-maker,

Small press publications usually
aren't — they're more of a cultural
contribution," Currier said.

Norman:

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Geoffrey Norman is one of those
writers — the tireless sort who
writes novels (that get published),
works as a contributing editor for
Esquire,Magazine and still finds time to
canoe through the Everglades. If
someone were to ask him how he
finds the energy, the creativity and
the time to do what he does, he'd
probably break into a big ole Alabama
smile, shrug his shoulders and say
something like, "Shucks, I just do it."

Norman doesn't actually use the
word "shucks" (at least not in this
interview), but he has accomplished
each of the above feats. His first
novel, Midnight Water, was published
last summer; his column, ”The Envir-
onment," appears monthly in Esquire;
and he recently paddled through the
famed Florida swamp with his wife.
All of this comes in addition to the
publication of his 1981 non-fiction
work, The Ultimate Fishing Book, and his
five years of freelancing articles for
such publications as Geo and Outside.

Yet, for all of his activity, Norman
remains a low—key figure in the liter-
ary world. He lives with his wife and
his two daughters in Vermont, where
he is a member of the local school
board and a justice of the peace.

For someone who has been
exposed to the brashness of Manhat-
tan's publishing circles, he has man-
aged to retain the geniality of his
native Alabama. He speaks slowly,
thoughtfully and without the ever-
present hint of exasperation that is
found in most East coast writers’ voi-
ces — with him, it's ”call back any-
time" instead of "leave your name
and number at the sound of the
tone/' ‘

Norman's entry into the profes-
sional world of journalism reads like a
dream. After college at Ohio's Miami
University and active duty in Viet-
nam as a Green Beret, he got his first
job in 1969 with Playboy Magazine. "It
was just a fortunate combination of
circumstances," he says. "I had a
friend there, and he knew some of my
unpublished writing. He was going to
take a nine-month leave of absence,
and the magazine needed someone to
work in his place....He suggested that
they hire me, so they looked at my
stuff and said, ‘Okay, we'll use you
strictly on a nine-month trial.’ That
way, they really weren't losing
anything."

In fact, Playboy was gaining some-
one valuable; Norman stayed on with
the magazine and ultimately became
its articles editor. In 1976, he left
Hugh Hefner's publication for Esquire
and eventually earned the position of
a senior editor. However, there was a
problem: the small-town writer could
not come to terms with New York's
big city shortcomings.

"You spend almost all of your time
on the logistics of apartments, travel
and that sort of thing. So, like a lot of
writers, I wanted to move to the
country for a long time and really
write," he says. "When I got the
chance, I jumped at it."

That chance arrived in the form of
"Outdoors," the first incarnation of
Norman's column for Esquire, which
allowed him to move to Vermont and
write about the subject he truly loves
-— the outdoors. He says it's the best
journalistic job he can imagine and
that the hardest part involves coming
up with ideas.

"If you do a column, you know your
style and your technique of getting

uilding His

Geoffrey Norman

the piece out. So, coming up with the
idea is the hard part - once you've
got that, you can make yourstyle fit
it," he says.

However, around the time that
James Watt started fueling the ire of
the nation's conservationists and nat-
uralists, Esquire decided to expand the
subject range of his column and
change its title to ”The Environ-
ment." This meant he had to consider
acid rain and stream pollution in addi-
tion to fly-tying and deer hunting. He
says he's not that unhappy with the
change but that it taxes his investiga-
tive talents. ”This has probably tested
my resources as a researcher more
than anything else I've done," he
says. "My columns aren't particularly
complicated, but a lot of the environ-
mentalists I talk to are. That means I
have to do an awful lot of glossary
work just so I know what they're
talking about."

While he continues to enjoy his
journalistic work, Norman has found
a more satisfying outlet in fiction
writing. Whereas his magazine work
tends to be a largely self-explanatory
job that limits him to sticking with
the facts, he sees novel writing as a

chance to employ his own creativity.

"Without trying to sound too ’Me
Generation’ or solipsistic about it, it
really is the most ’writerly,' the most
indulgent thing you can do as a wri-
ter," he explains. "That's not to say
you don't have to do it with craft and
discipline, but you're not forced to
write to somebody else's specifica-
tions. When I write for the magazine,
generally somebody is telling me
what to write about, how long it
should be -—— sometimes they'll even
go so far to give me the storyline or
the approach they want me to take.
That's writing to the assignment; like
building a house according to some-
one else's plans. I want to build my
own house."

His first efforts at fiction writing
consisted of several short stories; one
of them, "Armed And Dangerous,"
won an Edgar Award as the best mys-
tery short story of 1979. He had set
higher sights, though, and in the
summer of 1983, Dutton published
Midnight Water, a thriller about drug
smuggling in a small Florida fishing
town.

Praise for the novel, especially
from his literary peers, has been

VH1

OUSC

abundant. Roy Blount Ir. calls the
book a "hell of a tale”; Harry Crews
says, ”Here is a wonderful novel filled
with real people and real places, a
novel that has some of the best dia-
logue I've read in a very long time";
Larry L. King simply describes Mid-
night Water as "A tight, taut, crackling
yarn very well told"; and New Yorker
calls it a ”fine first novel" that is
"sparsely written but...full of
substance."

Of his first full-length fiction
effort, Norman says, "Everybody I
know who has published a novel,
especially their first one, has two sen-
sations: one is absolute gratitude that
it was published at all, and the second
is disappointment that it doesn't
become a big bestseller. In the first
place, you're hugely satisfied, but you
can't ever be totally satisfied. My edi-
tor tells me that the book did real well
for a first novel. I liked the reviews I
read, and it did sell into paperback
edition. If Hollywood would just call,
I'd be totally satisfied."

Actually, he isn't so sure about con-
verting Midnight Water into a screen-
play, at least not by himself. "It just

ITITZITTIQPESSES

By PAUL UNDERWOOD
‘And MARK A. SINDLER

Some events seem to serve as re-
newals in life. Reunions, weddings,
births and even New Year's Eve
replenish us somehow — we feel a
little surer of where we're headed,
more certain of where we've been.

This year's Writers' Conference
marks yet another renewal: the

doesn't strike me as something I'd do

all that well," he says.
Of course, he's open to the right
offer, but at the moment, he's con-
‘centrating on making time for both
sides of his writing. His method of
working doesn't have anything to do
with rabbits’ feet or good—luck
typewriters but, rather, with allot-
ting himself enough time for each
project. ''I don't have any rituals
where I sharpen five pencils and walk
around my desk two times, but
because I'm doing two different
things —- writing for Esquire and writ-

gng novels — I generally try to start

early and divide the day so Ican get in
at least two or three hours of fiction
writing a day," he explains.

Norman refers to his current pro-
ject as "just a great big ole sprawling
thing" about family, Vietnam and a
couple of. brothers, encompassing
two decades, from 1965 to 1985.

Somewhere between the writing
and the school board meetings, Nor-
isan escapes his hectic work schedule
by taking advantage of Vermont's
outdoor offerings. "I love to fish, and
I try to take as much of every October
off as I can in order to hunt —— I have a
Brittany Spaniel named Molly, and
we hunt birds together. I also try to
cross-country ski as much as I can,"

have come to Pitt to discuss their
craft. Former conference participant
and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet
Maxine Kumin joins novelist E.L.
Doctorow (Ragtime, Loon Lake) and
writer/editor Cordon Lish (Dear Mr.
Capote) in headlining this year's con-
ference, to be held from Friday,
March 16, through Sunday, March
18, at the university.

"It's an opportunity for students
and the whole Pittsburgh community
to meet some of America's most
important writers," says Lee Cut-
kind, conference coordinator and
associate professor in Pitt's English
writing department. "It's rare that
students get a chance not only to hear
them read but to talk tothem on a
one—to—one basis."

This individual contact between
authors and students will highlight
this year's conference. In addition to
giving the keynote address on Satur-
day evening at the William Pitt
Union, Doctorow (winner of the
1975 National Book Critics Circle
Award for Ragtime) will also conduct a
fiction workshop Sunday in the
union. Kumin, who won the 1973
Pulitzer Prize for Up Country, will fol-
low with a poetry seminar. Gordon
Lish, a former editor at Esquire, will
discuss "Editing and Writing: Wear-
ing Both Hats" on Saturday at 11 a.m.

Panel discussions include "Focus on
Freelancing," chaired by Esquire con-
tributing editor Ceoffrey Norman,
and "Literary Magazines and Small
Presses," featuring Pushcart Press
editor Bill Henderson. Barney Karp-
finger will offer practical advice
about literary agents, along with the
"Selling What You Write" panel-—a
discussion of the ins and outs of the
publication business. This session
will feature C. Michael Curtis, senior
editor of /ilantir Magazine; Jacquelyn
Powell, managing editor of Washing-
ton Iournalism Review; Elaine Ray,

Rasmus, editor of Outside Magazine;
and Norman.

On Friday evening, author Robert
Ward will answer questions about
translating the novel into film, fol-
lowing the screening of Little Britrhes
and Cattle /lnnie. Ward wrote both the
novel and the screenplay adaption.

Although the Saturday evening
program features the conference

headliners, students will share the
spotlight in the awards presenta-
tions: the Academy of American
Poets Award, The Barkspare Fiction
‘Contest winner and the Leo Koeber—
lein journalism Award. The evening
combines already successful writers
with the most promising of the next
generation.

The conference, then, concen-
trates on small groups and panels,
offering closer contact between vete-

writers who have spoken at Pitt.
Former conference participants
include author Toni Morrison (Song of
Solomon, Tar Baby), reporter David

' Halberstam (The Best and the Brightest),

poets David Ignatow and Carolyn
Forche, New York Times literary critic
Mel Watkins, Playboy editor Susan
Margolis and New Yorker staff writer
and Pulitzer Prize-winner Susan
Sheehan.

ran writers and students of the craft.
While the popular Saturday evening
program with Doctorow and Kumin
is a more traditional lecture/reading,
the rest of the two days emphasizes
smaller, informal groups with free
exchange of ideas and a format that
allows and encourages dialogue
between participants and audience.
The special focus on interaction

for the conference reqdires a battery
of sponsors, including the Student
Media and Publications Board, the
Pitt Program Council, ALCOA and
the film studies department. This
wide sponsorship makes it possible
for Pitt students to pick up confer-
ence tickets for free; other attendants
are charged just $5 for the three-day-
event, including the Saturday even-

has not come about magically; it has
evolved from the conference's long,
rich past. Although this year's gath-
ering presents many new names and
fresh perspectives, the conference's
alumni — both students and partici-
pants —— can attest to its history.

As an undergraduate at Pitt, Mat-
thew Kennedy, now a staff writer for
The Pittsburgh Press, worked as a stu-
dent coordinator for the conference.
Kennedy now calls that work
"rewarding," adding, "Interaction
and discussion are important. It dis-
tinguishes this [conference] from
becoming...a celebrity circus. Writ-
ing, generally, is such a lonely pur-
suit....That's why it's important to
get together.”

Likewise, former Pitt media
adviser Larry Lunsford —— now asso-
ciate dean of students at Robert Mor-
ris College — noted that it's "rare to
rub elbows with those who have been
successful in journalism, fiction or
film. That's the valuable aspect of it."
Calway Kinnell, a guest at the con-
ference two years ago, said it "gives
students a chance to see, face-to-face,
a poet whose work they see on the
page and, in an informal atmosphere,
get to talk to them." .

Kinnell, who won a Pulitzer Prize
for his collection Selerted Poems, is only
one of a long list of award—winning

ing program. ”It's designed so that it's
available to the most number of peo-
ple," Cutkind says.

The conference tradition, matched
with its present emphasis on personal
interaction, might well explain its
continued popularity. Nearly 1,000
people attended each of the last two
conferences, filling the lecture halls
and classrooms. It has become a rite
for local writers —— a tradition that
allows time to gather, take stock,
reconsider and, then, move on:
renewed.

Top Editors To Discuss 

‘Selling What You Write’

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Scenario: You're a recent graduate who's
worked long and hard to earn a bachelor's
degree 'in writing. You're living in a town or
city that does't have much to offer in the way of
a journalism career, so, at the moment, you're
working in an office. Your job requires that
you spend most days at a typewriter, every

feel so comforting. Instead of pounding out the

to type quadruplet copies of the boss' latest
memo. /is you attempt, for the fifth time no
less, not to make a spelling error in the date-
line, you remember how great it felt to finish

of these magazines aren't going to
come looking for you -—- YOU have to
seek them out!

Sound difficult? Nobody ever said_

that soliciting your writing was going
to be easy, however, it can be done -
and made a little less painful with a
few tips from some pros.

On the afternoon of Saturday,

March 17, five of the magazine
world's top editors will conduct a
panel discussion designed to aid
potential writers in ”Selling What
You Write." Participants will include:
C. Michael Curtis, senior editor at
The Atlantic; Geoffrey Norman, con-
tributing editor of Esquire; Jacquelyn
Powell, managing editor of Washing-
ton fournalism Review; John Rasmus,

have excellent writing

If this situation resembles your
own set of circumstances in any way,
shape or form, snap out of it! A quick
glance at any newstand will attest to
the fact that there's a wealth of
markets out there just waiting for
your writing talents. But the editors

‘ C. Michael Curtis

editor of Outside Magazine; and Elaine
Ray, careers editor of Essence.
Among the many questions that
the panel will undoubtedly answer is
the one that asks, "Where do I start?”
Rasmus answers quickly. ”You
have to be able to write a good query
letter. That's probably a key skill if
you're trying to free-lance a piece."
"Send a query telling us why the
article is important to our readers,”
adds Ray. ”And check the masthead
to see who the particular editor of
that section (where the article is
intended to appear) is — travel editor,
career editor, health editor or wha-
tever. Making sure that your query
gets to the right person is important,
too.” '
Editors generally agree that, while
you shouldn't include a resume with
your query letter, sending along
"clips" (samples of your previously
published work) is essential.
"If a writer sends a resume, l'll usu-

ally just put it on file —— I rarely even
look at it. Clips are what I need to see
if the writer is what we're looking
for," says Ray.

Norman stresses the importance of
gathering clips in order to gain more
experience but says that your writing
samples don't have to come from a
top—ranking publication.

"I think that before you attack
Esquire, or any national magazine, you
should have a track record. That's

A established by getting a few bylines

and proving that you can write pro-
fessionally," he comments. "The best
way is to get published locally or in
some small publication so you'll have
something to send."

Many potential free-lance writers
feel inadequate because they don't
have a writing or journalism degree;
they're filled with trepidation at the
thought of approaching one of these
smaller publications, much less a
nationally known one. Most of these
fears are unfounded’, though, since
most editors say that they couldn't
care less whether or not a writer has
been formally trained.

”There have been people who have
a master's in journalism from places
like Columbia, but who don't neces-
sarily have good grammar skills. And
then there are people who have never
taken a writing course in their entire
life who have excellent writing
skills," says Ray.

"Our writers all come from diverse
backgrounds," adds Rasmus. "They
don't necessarily come from journal-
ism schools or have writing degrees
or work on newspapers."

"The only issue that matters is the
material," says Curtis. ”And we —
like other magazines, I'm sure -— take

Geoffrey Norman
particular satisfaction in publishing
the work of writers who are utterly
unknown."

Although an unknown writer
might get lucky and have a piece pub-
lished in an established magazine, he
or she must possess the same skills as
a successful veteran free-lancer in

order to continue being published.
"You've got to be able to work effi-
ciently, and you've got to be able to
attack a subject in a way that's going
to be successful; you've got to be able

to write quickly and write in art"

organized manner, without ‘many
mistakes; and you've got to be able to
build on what you've gathered,"
explains Rasmus.

Curtis echoes these sentiments,
commenting that ”you have to be able
to write efficiently and quickly and
energetically."

’’I think the idea of selling a piece
isn't so much ’selling' something —
i.e., using the right technique to per-

suade the editor to print it. lt isn't asqe

important as becoming the kind of
writer who's in demand," continues
Rasmus. "There are certain kinds of
writers whom editors pursue and
whom editors think of when they
have a certain story in mind. I think a
free-lancer — a successful free-lancer
— should be trying to become that

kind of writer." ¢-«

”That kind of writer" possesses all
of the skills already mentioned, but
he or she must also possess resilience
and an ability to find other work
while waiting for a piece to be
accepted, or even rejected. Free—lance
writing isn't an easy way to make a
living, say the editors, but it's not
impossible, either. ‘

"Sure, it's possible," says Curtis"
"but you have to be very, very good.
If you want to make a living solely
through it, then you have to be able
to write material that's appropriate
for high-paying markets."

”You have to be a great money-
manager," concludes Ray. "It's very

difficult. I thought I'd like to do it
myself at one time, but now I'm not
so sure. It's tough —— but, sure, it's
possible. We're always looking for
new writers and fresh writers; nctitv
ideas and new ways of approaching
things, too. I mean, there's always
room for new writers."

..Linking The Writer And Publisher

19

By MICHAEL WEINMAN

”A big part of publishing is lunch
and drinks," admits literary agent
Barney Karpfinger, whose life seems
like endless dining and partying to
the people who work in the restau-
rants he frequents. But as literary
agents for New York's Aaron Priest
Agency, Karpfinger and his asso-
ciates provide a crucial link between
author and publisher in getting the
work of talented writers to the
public.

"Some of the mnitre d's tease me
about what an easy job I have because
I'm there for two—hour lunches all the
time. But it's really very hard work,"
he says, explaining that what appears
to be a simple lunch is actually a very
complicated and coy testing ground
for new writers and prospective
publishers.

The job of an agent is a mixture of
business, law and the art of recogniz-
ing a valuable writer. Coming to New
York as an English major at Columbia
University, Karpfinger's initial plan
was to be an attorney. ’’I spent a few
years as a paralegal,” he says, "and I
realized that that [being a lawyer]
was not at all what I wanted to do."

The skills of contract writing,
learned from his paralegal work and
his passion for reading, however,
made him a perfect candidate for the
job of an agent.

Karpfinger wound up in his profes-
sion not so much by intention but by
accident. And, like many people in
writing, he is quite candid about how
he's coped with balancing his per-
sonal goals and his interest in finan-
cial success in this highly competitive
field.

"I got in [the publishing business]
as a contract manager,” he says,
explaining that this mainly involves
writing the legal components of an
author's contract after the deal has
been agreed upon and finalized. The

cut-and-dry work of contract writing
left Karpfinger employed but unfull-
filled. "Contracts aren't what I
wanted to do, but it's always so hard
to get a job in publishing, and the
money was a little better than some-
thing else I could have done, so I took

the success of learning through expe-
rience and apprenticeships. ”It's such
a strange business, you really need
people who know the business...it's
not like selling shoes, ” he says.

His advice to anyone going into the
publishing business follows this same

it...and didn't really like it."

Taking into account his boredom as
a contract manager, it's easy to
understand he would be eager to
leave for something more rewarding.
And leave he did. He accepted a
friend's offer to try his hand at being
an agent and found the business/art
combination he had been seeking.

When Karpfinger talks about his
work, he sounds like a man very com-
fortable with what he does. It doesn't
take much to appreciate this when
one understands how much of his
work takes place away from the typi-
cal 9-to-5 crowd, unlike contract
work, which was mainly done in the
confines of his New York office.

"Publishing clings very much to
old-fashioned practices," says Karp-
finger. In publishing, word-of—mouth
is still an agent's best form of adver-
tising, and Karpfinger says he
receives most of his new writers by
way of recommendations from satis-
fied clients. He strongly believes in

Drawing By Mark Schneidmiller

line of thought: to be good, one
should "grow up in the business."
"If someone wanted to be an agent,
or an editor for that matter, the best
way to go about it would be to start as
a secretary to an established agent,"
he says. "Maybe sell some magazine
rights to someone or get a client or
two and grow from there. The people
who are really successful in publish-
ing are the ones who -trust their gut
instincts and run with them.”
Karpfinger sees some changes hap-
pening within the publishing busi-
ness — changes, he says, that are
primarily in the relationship between
a writer and his agent. Recalling
Maxwell Perkins, the famous editor
of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott
Fitzgerald, he says, "That kind of
trust relationship just doesn't happen
anymore because editors switch from
[publishing] house to house. It's the
agent who has taken over that role of
really getting to know the writer and
giving advice on much more than just

contracts and deals. An agent's job
now has a lot more to do with
support.”

Karpfinger says he's sold books for
as little as $2,000, but also for ”much,
much more than that." Like most
agents, he collects 10 percent of any-
thing he sells to a publisher but adds,
”If something is a little more difficult
to sell but is a really good piece of
work that really talks to me, then I'll
still work just as hard to sell it."

According to Karpfinger, many of
the bigger publishing houses, such as
Simon and Schuster, require that
writers be represented and won't
accept unsolicited manuscripts. How-
ever, he adds that, on occasion, suc-
cessful work can come from an
unsolicited author: ’’Ordinary People
was an unsolicited manuscript at Vik-
ing Press...but that type of thing is
very rare."

"It's really invaluable to have an
agent," he explains. "One of the
things we offer is that we know ever-
ybody in the publishing business."
Karpfinger does admit, however,
that it's possible for a writer to sell his
work to a publisher without the aid of
an agent but adds that an agent usu-
ally knows what each publisher is
looking for and how quickly the writ-
er can get his work finished and can
usually get a higher price for the
manuscript.

The role of an agent is often over-
looked in ‘popular conceptions of pub-
lishing —— he is often unrecognized
and is the first to be criticized for
problems, either by the publisher or
by the author. But the agent usually
is the one who first introduces a writ-
er to the publishing world. He is a
go-between for the writer and pub-
lisher, representing the wishes of the
writer in contract negotiations and
providing encouragement behind the
scenes. The position of a literary
agent is that of a silent, but crucial
hand in the publishing industry.

‘Changing, Growing, and Improving

By IOE ZEFF

Although the University of Pittsburgh houses the nation's oldest English
writing program, prospective journalists have tended to shy away from the
school.

You see, Pitt has no school of journalism, let alone a journalism
department.

That's not to say that journalism is ignored at Pitt. As of late, the
university has made a commitment toward improving its journalism pro-
gram and offerings.

One person who is a vital part of this expansion is the new media advisor
who was appointed in January. Wilfred Tremblay has replaced Larry Luns—
ford, now the dean of students at Robert Morris College.

Tremblay, .32, earned his bachelor's degree in radio/television from
Arkansas State University and his master's from Boston University. He
worked as a broadcaster in Missouri and Iowa, and as a professor at Buena
Vista in Iowa before coming to Pittsburgh.

The tall New Englander has set some lofty standards for the campus
newspaper, literary magazine, radio station and yearbook.

"My goal is to bring the media at Pitt to national recognition,” he says. "I
don't think that's out of reach."

His opinion is echoed at The Pitt News, which has already undergone
changes intended to upgrade its quality and promote interest among its
staff and readership.

The most noticeable change may be the new headline type — a clean font
called Korinna. Other new-comers to The Pitt News are Sports Monday, a
back-page presentation of the weekend's events; Scoreboard, an agate
statistics section; and Spectrum, a bi—monthly feature spread. Classified ads
have been evicted from the back page for better space management.

Todd Erkel, a junior majoring in English writing, was installed as editor-
in—chief in January. He joined the staff in September, 1981, as a writer for
Showrnse, The Pitt News’ weekly entertainment magazine.

Erkel thinks that Tremblay has been very helpful with implementing the
changes in that he has kept his distance.

’’I think the most important thing Wilfred has done is create an atmos-

phere that welcomes new ideas," Erkel says. ”Without that atmosphere, the
creative process would be denied."

It appears that that creative process has positively affected the newspap-
er's staff as well as its appearance.

”There’s been a tremendous improvement in the attitudes of the editors
and writers toward The Pitt News since we've redesigned our publication,"
says Opinions Editor Michael Weinman. "Many people within the news-
paper feel that is has improved much over last semester. There is definitely
a greater sense of commitment to the newspaper and a desire to incorporate
the entire university into producing and feeling pride in it."

Still, the white space under ”]ournalism" in the university course descrip-
tion handbook presents a problem for The Pit! News.

”Most of our editors don't have formal classroom training. Things like
design, editing and recruitment have to be learned on the job," Erkel says.

”I ttink this paper goes through cycles, and we have just begun such a
cycle.'The new personnel and the new ideas have begun to have a visible
effect on the paper."

Visiting writers and editors from The Pittsburgh Press have helped some of
the staff members around their inexperience. I. Bruce Baumann, The Press's
assistant managing editor, contributed his efforts toward redesigning the
newspaper, and news writers Martin Smith and Jerry Byrd conducted
workshops on the finer points of journalism.

Erkel said he has noticed a marked rise in interest from prospective
writers since changing the newspaper. New writers timidly step through
The Pitt News’ doorway every day. The news department claims to have close
to 60 writers, compared to about 20 in previous terms.

The sports department has become more popular as well.

”On the sports desk, we're making an attempt to get more people
involved with a much greater emphasis on accuracy and professionalism in
both reporting and interviewing," says Charlie O'Hara, sports editor.

Campus radio station WPGH is undergoing some changes, too. Its fre-
quency will be changed in September from the AM dial to PM 98.5. Trem-
blay's appointment may be especially profitable for WPGH, since the new
adviser is well—versed on broadcasting.

Culinary critics suggest that the
best restaurants attract the longest
lines; it is better that you call ahead.
That same measure of quality can be
applied to an academic department.

When Ed Ochester joined the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh's writing pro-

Ed Ochester

gram 14 years ago, there were a lot of
empty seats in his poetry writing
classes. In fact, there were no poetry
writing classes. Recently though, the
writing program has been drawing
rave reviews, and advisers tell stu-
dents to make their reservations
early. The work emanating from the
fifth floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing has gotten around.

Pitt recently found itself home to
three of the 113 winners of the
National Endowment for the Arts
Creative Writing Fellowships.
Ochester was one of those chosen,
and although he insists that the
award and the $12,500 cash prize
that accompanies it will do little to
change his life, the honor has once
again brought a bit of the spotlight to
the nation's oldest writing program.

But while longevity anchors Pitt's
writing program, the past decade has
brought significant changes. With
changes in course offerings and con-
tinuing expansion of the program on
both the graduate and undergraduate
level, few would recognize it in its
current form.

Ochester, an associate professor of
English, has had as much to do with
those changes as anyone. He served
as the director of the writing pro-
gram from 1979 to August of last
year. Battling what Ochester calls
"an endless amount of paper work,"
he still managed to improve the pro-
gram significantly.

”I came in 1970, and at the time,
although the writing program was
very old, it was relatively small,”
Ochester says. "What has happened
in the 14 years since I first came to
Pitt is that the number of courses has
expanded widely and the number of
students in total, as well as the
number of writing majors, is much
larger now than it used to be.”

"I think it was in 1971-72 that we
offered the first poetry writing
course, and there was never more
than one a term. Often, if you got 10

kids in that [class], it was a big deal.”

The writing program now regu-
larly fills four to six poetry writing
courses each term and offers a
sequence of non-fiction courses that
were nonexistent in the early 1970s.

Like many of the program's
faculty, Ochester's writing encom-
passes all of the tracts open to stu-

dents -— fiction, poetry and
non-fiction/journalism —— and he has
been published many times. His most
recent work is a collection of poetry
entitled Miracle Mile (Carnegie-
Mellon University Press, 1983).

A father of two, the 45-year-old
Ochester wrote the title poem after
many long drives from his Arm--
strong County home to the Pitt cam-
pus. He discovered something out
there on Route 22, along a stretch of
highway known as Miracle Mile
where the shopping malls roam and
the fast food joints lay. He discovered
poetry.

”The poem [Miracle Mile] is a kind of
strange, crazy overview of American
pop culture," Ochester explains.
”And in some ways, the book is that
way. There are a number of poems in
it that are sociologically oriented.

”Everybody writes in some way
about where they live or where they
have lived — as opposed to writing
poems about traveling in Majorca or
living in Gibraltar. It seems to me
that that sense of where you are now
and where society is and what it looks
like is as important to American
writers.”

Ochester says that he enjoys living
away from the inner city, in what he
affectionately refers to as ”the
sticks." He moved to an old farmstead
in Armstrong County, an area north-
east of Pittsburgh rich in coal and
dotted with small farms, in 1972.

”It's exactly where I want to be. I
don't write better anyplace else," he
says.

Ochester says that the money he
received from the National Endow-
ment will allow him to do some trav-
eling and to take it easy but that he
will not take any time off from the
university or his writing. His writing,
he says, has been going too well to
stop now.

"With this book and some of the
other things I have been doing, I have
really been on a pretty good sprint

with my writing for about the last
year and a half. Things have been
going very well, so I don't want to
interrupt my schedule."

Lewis ”Buddy” Nordan only began
writing a little more than a decade
ago. Before that, he mostly listened.

Back home in Jackson, Miss., Nor-

dan sat on the front porch or over at
the local feed store and listened to his
neighbors and relatives practice the
craft of storytelling.

He has taken those early experien-
ces, given them a voice in the tradi-
tion of great Southern fiction and
become a writer.

"My family was always story-
tellers,” Nordan says. ”I grew up on
oral storytelling, but I don't know
when it became written storytelling."

Nordan’s most recent work, a col-
lection of short stories entitled Wel-

”I didn't know th.at until suddenly I
began to see that [the stories] were
similar to each other in certain ways,”
Nordan says. ”The stories are about
people whose lives are based in family
mythology and legend."

Nordan joined the faculty of Pitt's
English department in September,
1983, after teaching a course here
during the preceding Summer Term.
He came to Pitt from the University
of Arkansas. Before that, Nordan
shuffled from job to job, in and out of
academia in the South

The transition eastward to Pitts-
burgh has been a surprisingly easy
one for him to make.

"The hills and the colors of the
trees in the fall and the landscape
[here] is very much the same as the
Ozark Mountains where I grew up,”
he says.

Nordan says that he has also met
with pleasant surprise — a group of
very talented writing students at Pitt.

”I have been very impressed. The
students are exciting to me, and they
have been helpful to me in getting
adjusted here. Some of the students
have already begun to publish.

”I am just very pleased in general
with the high quality of talent among
the students here.”

Nordan tries to relay to his stu-
dents some of what he has seen and
heard on those Mississippi porches.

"I try to tell them that there have
always been stories to be told and
that we can tell them with our voices
or we can make up new voices to put
on a page," he says.

Nordan has developed a character
name Sugar Mecklin, whom he has
included in a few short stories. Even-
tually, he wants to publish an entire
collection of stories involving
Mecklin.

”I haven't been writing long
enough to know that I am doing it,
but it is so much fun to find a charac-
ter whom I really love -— a character
about whom I want to know more —
and to start discovering his life, and
that is what I am doing with Sugar."

He tries to spend three hours in

His work on this collection began
seven years ago, although it wasn't

. Writing Program
Still Expanding

By DINA LARDAS

Over the years, Pittsburgh has
been dubbed The Smoky City, The
Steel Town, The City of Champions
and, most recently, The City With A
Smile. The mention of its name still
evokes images of smog, mills and
football championships, but the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh writing pro-
gram is hard at work to add yet
another image to that list —— writers.

Created in 1930, the writing pro-
gram is the oldest in the country and
has gone through as many changes as
Pittsburgh has nicknames. There was
only a handful of full-time faculty
members for writing and a virtually
extinct journalism department when
assistant professor Lee Gutkind was
hired in 1970.

"Back then, there was a constant
demand for more courses to give stu-
dents," says Gutkind, who became a
full-time professor of non-fiction in
1972. Today, he is the director of
Pitt's writing program, having taken
on the position when Ed Ochester
resigned last year. He now works
with a faculty four times larger than
it was when he first came to Pitt, and
he is doing his best to insure the con-
tinuing growth of the program.

Since September, several new
courses have been implemented, with
more already scheduled for next year.
Ron Benrey, director of communica-
tions at Westinghouse, teaches "Cor-
porate Speech Writing,” a subject on
which he has also written a book.
"Literary Magazines and Small
Presses" — taught by Tony Petrosky,
founder of Slow Loris Press — is
designed to educate young writers on
where their market is and on how to
run a small literary magazine. Stu-
dents in the class are even putting

their knowledge to the test by pub-

lishing their own literary magazine,

entitled Round and Catch.

Gutkind is also pleased with the
expansion of the English depart-
ment's extremely successful intern-
ship program, which gives students
the opportunity to receive credit for
writing outside of the classroom

"It's the atmosphere here that
makes writing at Pitt so special," says
Gutkind. "You can't be a better wri-
ter by only studying and writing
alone. You need to interact with oth-
ers —— be a part of a community --
which is something that this program
offers perhaps more than any other
university in the country.

"Jobs are available to students at
The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh 1\/lagazine
and Pittsburgh Business Times, aswell as
in the promotion departments of cor-
porations such as Westinghouse and
Ketchum," he says. ”Since Septem-
ber, we've tripled the number of
internships available because they
are so popular.”

That popularity and growth go
hand-in-hand is further proof of the
writing program's success. There are
approximately 250 undergraduates
enrolled as writing majors at Pitt —
the most in the country. The stu-
dents have a choice of one of three
tracts: non-fiction, which consists of
magazine or newpaper writing, fic-
tion or poetry. MFAs are also offered

:»*in these areas, providing graduate
students with a degree, a publishable
manuscript and teaching experience
upon completion of the course
studies.

Students can also turn to places
beyond the classroom for help in
their writing. In addition to intern-
ships, the writing program brings
visiting professors to campus and.

sponsors the Pitt Contemporary Wri-
ters Series and the annual Writers’
Confernce. Past guests have included
Raymond Carver, Louis Simpson,
David Halberstam, Carolyn Forche,
Barry Hannah, Toni Morrison, David
lgnatow and Susan Sheehan.

The Writers’ Conference is yet
another event designed to bring wri-
ters together; it's also another one of
Gutkind’s projects. As the conference
director for the last eight of 10 years,
he has been responsible for inviting
guest writers and overseeing the
interns and overall operations. He is
quick to praise the Office of Student
Activities and student organizations
for the help he's received in these

events.

"One thing never done before that,_
I think, is precedent setting is work-
ing closely with groups such as the
Pitt Program Council and the Stu-
dent Government Board. Without
them, we wouldn't have the money to
pay for the conference. We're work-
ing together and combining the few
dollars we do have to spend on a cul-
tural event that benefits the students
both from an activities and an educa-
tional point of view. That doesn't
happen anywhere else,” he says.

With Lee Gutkind at the reins, the
University of Pittsburgh writing pro-
gram is expanding, offering not only
students but all local writers the
opportunity to interact and make
Pittsburgh a city of writers.

"l think he'll be a really good influence on the station,” says Lisa LaValle,
news director at WPGH. "He seems to be very interested in the station and
its new FM status. He said that's one of the reasons he came here."

The transmission is currently sent through a carrier line to some of the
university residence halls on AM 640. In the fall, a 30-watt transmitter will
be installed atop the Cathedral of Learning, extending WPCH’s broadcast-

The changeover to FM could be helped along by a new computer the
station hopes to acquire. Tom Walsh, who trains deejays at WPCH, said
that the station wants to purchase a KAYPRO 10, a business computer
with vast storage capabilities.

"It would make us a paper-free station," Walsh explains. The computer
costs $2800 and can be programmed for logs, promotional announcements
and other radio station necessities.

A 24-hour format may also be in the offering if WPGH can come up with
the necessary manpower. According to LaValle, this could be of some
advantage to the news department. ‘

Music, however, will continue to dominate the airwaves generated from
the WPCH studios in William Pitt Union.

"We'll play what we're playing now, which is new musiclalbum-oriented
rock," Walsh says. ”We'll play anything from Dream Six to Journey."

Both Walsh — who was general manager of WPGH until January, when
junior K.J. Jones stepped in -— and LaValle agree that the station's format is
varied, within limits. '

"We're not like WRCT [at Carnegie Mellon]," says LaValle. "We're not
going to play heavy metal one minute and classical the next. Our format can
be pretty strict."

One thing that concerns WPCH is the possibility of university interven-
tion once it transfers to the center of the FM dial.

. "They do own the license," stresses Walsh. "They could come in and lay
down the law, making every thing public affairs announcements. That's
what we're waiting for.”

Anticipation seems to be the key word at Pitt, where campus media
continues to exceed expectations and grow.
