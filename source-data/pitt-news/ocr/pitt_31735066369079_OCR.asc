Markus Gives Residents 
Time toRevcimp Lottery 

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer
Resident students presented
demands for recognition of a
resident hall-wide vote and accept-

~ ance of alternatives to the proposed

housing lottery to Acting Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Markus at Friday’s Stu-
dent Affairs Advisory Council
meeting. '

The usually sparsely attended
meeting drew the attention of
approximately 30 students repres-
enting the two major factions
opposing the lottery system. T

The Housing Task Force, com-
prising primarily Tower C stu-
dents, began‘ by asking Markus to

consider its demand for a residence _

hall-wide ‘vote on the lottery
measure.. Kim Biehl, representing

Guidas ph°t° the Task Force, reminded Markus.

that such a vote was endorsed by
the Inter-Residence ‘Board Mon-
day. ' ~ '

Markus said a vote would be of .

planned or ‘before any alternative

plan to the lottery is formulated. A I.

Biehl also criticized the lottery
system and claimed
student input" was not_ solicited
when developing the new system.

“While I do believe we tried to

work with student leadership’ in .

developing this proposal, I’m going

to take the whole proposal from the _ -'

-Office of Residence Life and give it

back to RSA to take a critical look at‘

it,” Markus said. _ 4

later and we still haven’t heard

During two Student, Government.

Board Assembly meetings, Haddad
and Holloway confronted _each
other and defended their respective
organizations. At last Tuesday's
meeting, Holloway brought char-
ges of incompetence against
Haddad.

“I cannot conceive of any
competent leader" not knowing
exactly where a $7,500 allocation
(for the Chuck Mangione concert)
went,” Holloway said; “I’m sure
the Student Government Board
president knows exactly where all
of the money in his organization
goes, just as I know where the
money in my organization goes.”

Haddad said Holloway was

wrong to launch _a personal attack

  

further comments are made,
Holloway should study the program
council structure and hierarchy.

“It is ﬁne to accuse people if
you have the facts and a genuine
interest in the issues,» but Mark
isn’t addressing the issues.”
Haddad said, “This was nothing
more than a personal attack on me
when he said, ‘Tammy Haddad,
you are incompetent.’ ”

Haddad said -it was quite
possible for her not to know that’
the student-run Chuck Mangione
concert was

is not required to give her ﬁnal
approval on any program run

program council leadership in

general.

‘ ‘I hold no personal thing against
Tammy. I would have the same
feelings and would have said the
same things to anybody who was in
the leadership position of PUPC,”
Holloway said.

Holloway added that in the very
near future his ‘organization will
release a plan for total restructur-
ing of the program council. He
refused to comment on the content
of the plan now, however.

“It is not so much the concert,
but the concept of PUPC that we
are the victims of, ” Holloway said.
“It’s just a shame the whole black
community had to show the campus

that PUPC is not a workable A
machine.” '

Holloway cited the lack of
communication between the two
organizations as a major block.

tr

“All correspondence has been in
the form of letters. This isn't the
way to do business, I know that
much,” Holloway said. “When I

have a complaint about something i

with student government, I go
down to the third ﬂoor and talk with
them face to face.”

Holloway also questioned the
loss of applications from Black
Action Society from representa-
tives for membership on program
council committees.

“It seems to me that PUPC
didn't really make an effort to
recruit black people,” Holloway
said. “It seems as though they
have just as generally lax attitude
toward black people as far as
responses and needs.”

‘ ‘We do have black members and
representatives of BAS on PUPC
right now.” Haddad said. “As far
as us losing applications goes,
there were a lot of things lost when‘

people who know what ‘really’

we moved, things that could not be
placed right at hand. I believe
anyone who was really interested in
PUPC would not sit back for weeks
and wait for someone to call them.
They would take the initiative.

Holloway said he hoped some
resolution might be found at
today's Student Government Board
Assembly Council meeting.

Haddad concurred with Hollo-
way in saying she hoped some end
soon might be reached in the
problems between the two groups.

“The emotion really has been
taken out of the issue by now”
Haddad said. “It seems as though
the latest thing is to tell your secret
about PUPC. If students want
answers, all they have to do is come
to one of the leaders in PUPC to get
the correct information. I really
think the public has had enough of-

happened. ’ ’

FROM

  FINDING A

How Govemment’s spending can price you out of work
Inﬂation’s danger is very real to you because it threatens
your chances of landing a job. .-We say our government, by
trying to give us everything we want right now, actually
causes inﬂation. .Here‘s why.

If government collects enough taxes to pay its extra bills
as it goes, those‘ taxes- raise everybody’s costs. You pay more
yourself in taxes on your income. And companies pay more
income tax and taxes on the materials and services they
have to buy. So everybody7s tax bill goes up.

But as we all know, government is spending money even
faster than it can collect taxes. Everybody-still pays, be-
cause government -handles the deficit either by borrowing
money or printing it. Borrowed money costs extra to pay
the interest——and our national "debt is now more than
$550.000_,000,000. Extra printed money simply dilutes the
value of all the money in circulation. Either way. costs go
up for everybody—~and that's inflation. You’ll pay
$2.25 today to buy what a dollar bought only .
20 years ago. -

It now costs business $45,300, to
create the average Americanjob.
(Armco’s cost is $57,520.) Every
time the cost of a job goes up.
fewer jobs can be created with
the same amount of money. Some
companies can’t earn enough
extra money these days to
create so many new jobs.

This threatens your chance of
finding the job you want.
93,000.000 Americans now hold
jobs. But you’re among 17,000,000
more men and women who'll be
looking for work in the next 10 years.

Plain talk about ‘INFLATION
It’s often fashionable to blame business and
labor for higher prices. But that's taking a
result and making it the cause. The more gov-
emment tacks on additional charges, the higher
costs have to go. And the more government spends

tomorrow’s money today, the more prices rise to cover

the cost. Most of all, the more causes and tasks we insist
our government take on, the more money government must

spend to carry out our will. Ourfederal deficit is running’ ~
at least $60,000,000,000, a year, now." That’s a million and _

a third jobs were missing, right there.

What can we do‘? We all have favorite programs we’d
like our government to spend money on. But maybe spend-
ing only what we’ve paid in taxes is the most important

_ service our government can provide us._ If we could get

government to set priorities——with every worthwhile goal
in relation to all others—then maybe we could stop spend-
ing money so fast we create inflation.

Next time somebody says government ought to do some-
thing, think about the job you want when you finish school.
Then ask that person why you should give up your job
or buying power for somebody else’s pet idea. ‘

can. All I ask is that you put your
‘ﬁzst thinking together in dealing
with the status quo system (the
ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve system of
room selection) that will not be
accepted by this administration,”

Markus said.

iMarkus outlined the reasons
behind his refusal toaccept the
'status quo method of room
selection.

“It (the status quo system) was
found to be a bad situation,”
Markus said. “We found our office
doing public relations work dealing
 parents and students, con-’
cerning the matter that created an
enormous bad will for the
University. We found that there
must be some alternative to the
status quo system. Of course, at
this point in this meeting, it is
really ludicrous even to attempt to
debate the question.”

Markus assured the task force

, that its petition would be turned.

over to Chancellor Posvar.

"When that number of people
(2,889) put their signatures on a
petition, there deﬁnitely is con-
cern,” Markus said. “I am not;
however, going to present any type
of majority and minority report to
the Chancellor. I only will present
the plan I believe to be the best.”

“Our only comment at this point
is the fact that the administration
will not even consider a total
student vote on the issue,” Biehl
responded.

Tim Kearney and Jon Kushner,
both members of the McCormick
Hall Residence Hall council, then
presented a proposal referred to as
the .‘ ‘McCormick Compromise, ”
also endorsed by the Inter-
Residence Board."

Kearney and Kushner drafted
the proposal, calling for a
combination of the lottery and the
ﬁrst-come, first-serve system used
in the past.

Under the compromise proposal,

all resident students would be

mailed housing applications. Later .

a specific week would be establish-
ed during which students would be
asked to take their applications to
various points on campus to declare
whether they wished to participate
in the lottery or the ﬁrst-come,
ﬁrst-serve system. 0

‘ After that week, the number of
housing spaces available to the
lottery or first-come, first-served
group would be determined by the
percentage of students who desired
to participate in either the lottery or
ﬁrst-come, first-serve system. _

“All right, let’s develop a
consensus ' within the next two
weeks,” Markus said. , “At the end
of two weeks I want you to present
this proposal or the alternative to
me.
before, let’s try to pull ourselves
together now and get some input
now.”

Kearney then referred to the
deadline for submission of any
alternative to the lottery systemfa

Terrorist Attack on Tourist Bus

By The Associated Press

JERUSALEM—A bomb explod-
ed’ Sunday on an intercity bus
packed with Israelis and tourists in
the occupied West Bank, and
hospitals reported four persons

\were killed and 37 wounded in the
worst terrorist incident here in five
months. , "

In Beirut, Yasser Arafat’s Fatah ‘

guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying in a communique
that an “underground squad acting
inside occupied Palestine planted a
timed heavy explosive charge in an 7
§~*§iemy_ bus while en route from the
Dead Sea area to Jerusalem.”
Hospital officials said three of
the dead were a young Belgian and
two Israelis, and that 12 of the
injured were tourists from Canada,
Sweden and Britain. No Americans
were reported hurt. The identity of

the fourth person killed‘ was not _
q immediately known. “

The /bomb blast occurred only
hours after the Israeli
meeting 10 miles away in Jerusa-'
lem, began debate on ~Egypt’s
demand for a timetable’ to establish
Palestinian autonomy in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
 major concern of the Israelis in

terrorists in the occupied territories
if they are given autonomy. The
Cabinet debate was adjourned
until Tuesday without a decision.

“I was told that today (_Friday)
was the absolute -deadline for

submitting any alternative plans,”

Kearney said.

“Regardless of what Residence
Life ‘told you, I cannot ignore this
show of interest. On Dec. 1, I want
your very best thinking,” Markus
said. “I'm not saying now that I’m
going to accept this thinking.

“We have to move and put
something together,” Markus
added. “I am only asking that the
next ‘two weeks be productive
weeks of finding what we can do
collectively. If it ends up as your
proposal, ﬁne. If it ends up ours,
well that’s ﬁne.

In other business, Markus spoke
of the wave of reassignments in the
Office of Student. Activities last
Thursday. ‘ A ’

Milani also remarked on the
reassignments that resulted pri-

marily from the, resignation of the  

former director, Willard “Bud”
Heaps. \

“We believe these. reassign-
ments will better serve the needs of
the students,” Milani said. “What

Encare Oval" was subjected to one of the
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a
vaginal contraceptive. Results were
. excellent—showing that Encare Oval

provides consistent and extremely high
sperm-killing protection. This recent U.S.
report supports earlier studies in Euro-

Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
clse, premeasured dose of the potent,
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once
properly inserted, Encare Oval melts and
gently effervesces, dispersing the sperm-
killing agent within the vagina.

The success of any contraceptive
method depends on consistent and
accurate use. Encare Oval "‘ is so conve-

Changing
The Lottery

Led by Housing Task Force member Kim Biehl
and McCormick dorm council members Tim Kearney
and Jon Kushner, some 30 students ‘voiced their

vote would be of little value because there was not

enought time to develop an alternative system before

January. . -

“While I do believe we tried to work with student
leadership in developing this proposal,” Markus
said, “I’m going to take the whole proposal from the
Office of Residence Life and give it back to Resident
Student Association (RSA) to take a critical look at
it. - «

“Critique it, reject some notions if you can.
All I ask is that you put your best thinking together in
dealing with the status quo system that will not be ac-
cepted by this administration,” Markus told the‘

T group.

The lottery system was first discussed last year by

the RSA and the Office of Residence Life. But these .

discussions were never really publicized. To our
knowledge, there were never any announcements for
an “open forum” or any type of general meeting
enabling residence students to voice their views.
And if resident students were left in the dark, what
about students at regional campuses who applied to
Oakland last winter or commuters weeking on-
campus housing? “

The first time the student body was introduced to
the lottery was at an RSA meeting early in October of
this year—even then we were told the new system was
still a proposal. Nothing was finalized.

The system should have been finalized last winter
after the last mad scramble for dorm space. This
would have given the housing office the springand
summer months to inform students about the
change of plans. Students’ then would have beenable
to register any complaints they may have had last
September—enough time to put together a com-

_ winter term.

Page 6—Monday, Novelnber 20, 1978

Markus’ “Two weeks” comes at a time when mfofst
students will be thinking about turkeys and Penn
State, so sratch this first week-most students will be
gone from Wednesday to Sunday. This leaves one
week--the week prior to finals-—that students can
iron out a compromise with the administration.
This is not enoughtime.

There are advantages to the status quo
system——there are also advantages to the lottery
system and the McCormick compromise. But
nothing can be accomplished in one week.

It seems many students will be upset with whatever «

kind of plan the administration decides on for the
It is hoped that administrators and
student leaders will begin registering student inputon
the newsystem early this winter and then begin plans
for a new program «next year. This should involve
meetings open to all students, taking into con-
sideration a variety of plans presented by. different
groups. E I '
Hopefully, administrators and students will have
learned from their mistakes this term, and come up
with a stronger and much broader plan for housing

On Nov. ,9, Skip Robinson, leader

an enthuseastic crowd of far more
than 100 students and others in the
Student Union Kurtzman Room 7 as
part of his nationwide tour to build
support for the resistance in Tupelo
and resistance against all racism.
" What’s going on in Tupelo?
The United League, a militant
mass organization now 70,000
strong. has been organizing blacks

the hiring of black teachers and an
end to police and Ku Klux Klan

The movement picked up mo-

citizens learned about white, police
brutality against black inmates.

In Holly Springs, 60 miles from '4

Tupelo, a 25-year-old black inmate,
James Garret, was found hanging
in his jail cell with his hands tied
behind his back. About the same
time, a black inmate in Tupelo,
Eugene Paste, was beaten severly
in his jail cell. In both cases city
ofﬁcials did not want to take action
against the racist cops.

But with the people’s growing
resistance, through armed demon-
strations and a black boycott of all
white business (which has been 90
percent effective), the two cops
eventually were given a two-week
suspension and then transferred to

This
strategy is used ti) keep corporate
proﬁts" high, with workers fighting
each other, instead ' of uniting
against their common enemy.

With the rapid spiral depression
of our economy, the capitalists are
ﬁnding it necessary to intensify this
racism. This is why the
government promotes and protects
the police and Klan brutality
against blacks.

And this is why the reforms
gained in the 1960s are being taken
away through legislative actions.
Afﬁrmative action programs were
set up in jobs and education in an

‘attempt to combat racism and

sexism. But what is happening to
thefn now? The recent Bakke
decision was-only the beginning of
judicial decisions to take away all
reforms. By claiming reverse
.discrimination.for Allan Bakke, the
court tries to say that whites (and
particularly white men) now are
being discriminated against. This
is only a cover’ for the racist
decision to cut back on all
affirmative action and any chasnce
within our system of fighting
racism.

In California,.Proposition 13, the

, acclaimed “tax revolt" measure, is

another way with which lawmakers

are trying to undermine the gains

won previously. . Propositioin‘ 13 ,

was supposed to help working
people with their tax burdens. In

reality, corporations will receive 60-

percent relief in taxes,fv‘vhile social
services are being slashed contin-
ually. The results are cutbacks in
education, including the firing of
many teachers, closing of public

facilities, such as daycare centers

and centers for senior citizens, 
reduction in welfare. Proposition
13 has served to beneﬁt co;pora-
tions and hurt working people,
especially blacks and other minor-
ities. ‘
Along with legal legislation
swinging toward the right is a_
growing resistance among working
people. It is painfully obvious that
racism is not conﬁned‘ to Tupelo,

. Miss. People throughout the whole

country must ﬁght racism on all

. fronts and through all its disguises.

Many Pitt students who attended
Robinson's lecture also agreedﬁto

-participate in a‘mass demonst’r‘3-

tion to be held in Tupelo on Nov.
25. This response by Pitt students
is encouraging; it is important for
all people to participate in the
upcoming demonstration and in the
ﬁght against racism.

Getting the Facts Straight on the Program C

7‘

-~ After reading The Pitt News for
the past few weeks, I have noted
some seemingly incomplete Or
inaccurate reporting.

Did the Pitt Union Program
Council actually break its contract
with the Mangioneshow? If it
worked with Gates Music Co;,
that’s a clear indication it did not
produce the show. Even if it did,
why was chairwoman Tammy
Haddad repeatedly attacked when
it was Jack Brown’s‘ signature
required on the contract?

Why does the Black_ Action

f$ociety claim the Program Council

did not offer them a Black Week
Concert when it was reported in
The Pitt News of Monday, Oct. 23,

‘ 1978, that it was in fact offered

Teddy Pendergras, Donna Summer

‘ and ‘Al Jarreau? If this is headline ‘

material, why does this inconsis-
tency remain so vague in the paper.
Why is The Pitt News continuing to
print these comments when none
of the previous have been proved
factual? I’m_sti1l waiting to ﬁndout
who are the “All student organiza-

tions” that Mona Riscoe of the
Black Action Society said, in the
Oct. 23, -1978 issue, that were
“dissatisfied with PUPC.” I'm
sure if these organizations existed,
The Pitt News would have them in
the headlines followed by Mark
HO1loway’s comments‘. _
Isn't ita fact that the purpose of
the Student Government Board
Assembly meeting on Nov. 14,

.was to discuss SGB member Jan

Medoff’s proposal for student-
produced concerts? Why didn’t he
present and expound on it’s
ramifications? Why was _ the
discussion regarding concert‘ pro-
cedures reported second to Mark
Hol1oway’s personal attack on
Tammy Haddad? If -concert
procedures were the issue being

addressed at this meeting, why was I

Mr. Holloway permitted to hold the
ﬂoor for the purposes of unfounded
accusations? ‘

sion of concert procedures? .Isn’t

the real news the fact that less
than 15 of the 100 student
organizations were in attendance of
this special session? I think this
might indicate student apathy
toward the concert issue. Or could
there be a remote possibility that
the student population is pleased
with the concerts the program
council has made available to
them?

Finally, -does The Pitt News
believe it is reporting accurately?
Does it even care what the public
ﬁnds important? Is The Pitt News

trying to force Tammy Haddad into
resigning_and hoping the program
council fails? Is Mark Holloway
looking out for black students’
interests in his accusations and in
his refusalof the three proposed
concerts?

their opinions, but to separate

Last year the resident students
screamed injustice at the room
reservation policy. Last year we
were right. The Office of

I Residence Life" and the Housing

Ofﬁce were the ﬁrst to -agree. Who
really appreciates a call from an’
irate parent on why their child ..was
puton a waiting list for a room
when they had perfectly good
reasons for missing arbitrary
deadlines? They didn’t and I, as
Resident Students Association
chairperson, certainlyhdid not. So
we all sat down and looked over the
alternatives. The meetings were
held at atime. when you, my dear
fellow students, are concerned with
only one thing—ending the year.
We sat and chewed through

7 many different ideas.‘ How would

you like rooms decided on Q.P.A.
as certain University administra-

tors suggested?’ Or how about by

zip code with those people who
could conceivably commute, but

who had opted to live on campus,
being forced out?_ We went
through a lot of different ideas, and
we settled for the most equilateral
and fair solution possible: a
‘lottery. I’m not saying this is the
bestpossible solution—more dorm
space ﬁts that bill—and sincethere
are no dorms even projected to be
built, the lottery is the fairest thing
going.

The number of ‘students from
each class remains the same, so
what’s the beef? I’ll tell you what

' is the real complaint: the fact that

everyone has the same chance ‘you

do. No more would you be able to‘

cut or muscle in line or have
someone turn in 20 applications.
Now it would be an equal system
for all and that really bothers some
people.

I ask you to put yourself in my
shoes at that time. Why were there
only two students at those
meetings? Because no one else

gave a damnthen. I gave my own
time, freely, and with an equal
voice in the proceedings. Some say
that one or two people do not
represent the resident student
body. If this is true, then why elect
someone at all? Why should the
Resident Students Association‘
even exist? Organizations such as
the Resident Students Association,
with their elected leaders, must
exist because 4,000 people talking
at- once will not achieve anything.
I believe I spoke with a fair voice
for all resident students by
supporting a totally equal and just
system: the lottery. Istill support
that system, and if one does not, he
only propagates the already exten--

sive belief that our environment ‘

here is one of survival rather than
sharing. ‘

This is the beginning of a great

RockeS’rars -- Just LikeNex’r DoorNeighbors

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Pitt News Staff Writer . _ .
After reading my articles and interviews in The Pitt

News, many people have asked me. “What are rock stars
really like in person?"

My experiences with rock celebrities run the gamut from
enjoyable and informative interviews to friendly partying to
stupid run-arounds usually caused by the incompetence of
a manager or record company employees.

l’ve learned over the years that rock stars are really no
more flawed or outstanding than anyone else._ They merely
possess so_m_e sort_of_ musical talent and have achieved a

Rlck Derringer, at right, used to play guitar for Edgar
w"“°' 09") before ‘launching a solo career. ‘

great deal of success either through luck, hard work,
‘proper timing or good management. A ‘

Some, with their large salaries and adoring publics, have
turned into walking, talking citadels of ego and insecurity;
the majority, however, have been well-adjusted to their
success and are as friendly as your next-door-neighbor.

In the following three-part series, I plan to relate both
the good and bad experiences I've had, trying to make
clear that all of these interviews are being related through
my eyes and may or may_not have anything to do with what
other people felt at the time. ‘ ‘

Most of the interviews took placed either backstage of
such auditoriums as the Stanley Theater and Civic Arena or
in a hotel lounge or room. ’

Andy Mac_Kay, horn and reed player for the now defunct.

progressive British_advant garde group, Roxy Music.

MacKay was interviewed at the William Penn Hotel
downtown in March of 1976 after Roxy Mus,ic’s
well-received show at the Carnegie-Mellon Gymnasium.

MacKay struck me as a serious musician (many British
artists are), deeply involved with his work. Although
congenial, he wasn’t the sort of person who would plop his
feet up on the table and have a drink with you. Primarily,
he was all business.- ‘

Bob Weir, Lead Singer, rythym guitarist and a founding
member of the legendary San Francisco-based rock group,
the Grateful Dead.

Weir was in a surprisingly good mood when I
interviewed him on April Fools Day in 1976.

Kingﬁsh, the band with which- he was performing
during a hiatus from the Dead, had played a dramatic
concert before a handful of Pitt students at the Syria‘
Mosque. ‘

Weir, along with Kingﬁsh drummer Chris Herold and

-the band's manager, John Mclntire, were noticeably

relaxed as we talked over drinks in Weir’s room until 5

_ a.m.

Although laid back, the three had strong, intelligent
opinions on the myraid of topics we discussed: drugs, the

.the alcohol.

l960’s, the incredible Deadhead cult, touring in the 1970's
and the good old U.S.A. — , p’ A , '

What struck me as so amazing was the way_ they kept on
producing deep, intelligent answers despite the effects of

Ozark Mountain Daredevils, I interviewed several
members of this country-rock band backstage at the
Stanley Theater in October of 1976.

Every band member was friendly and wholesome, but
my gut feeling was these guys were more -interested in

._ talking about their homelife on the farm rather than the
intricacies of their music.

It was pleasant, but the guys
didn’t have much to say. - —
Rick Derringer, Only 5-foot-4, 120 pounds, Derringer is
a ﬁrebrand rocker throughout, owning a vibrant,

interesting personality. ’

We talked for an hour backstage at the Arena . in
November 1976 and his ‘.‘Nice-guy reputation about which I
had heard so much certainly was borne out. , ‘

If every one were as outgoing and friendly as Derringer,
all interviews would be a gas. I

Aynsley Dunbar, drummer for Journey and once the
highest-paid studio drummer in the world. ,

Dunbar was one of my favorite interviews because of his
honesty. V , _

He said he was mad the band was added at the last
moment to play at a Pitt Program Concert in March 1977.
He also was whipped from endless roadwork and upset to
hear about the light advance ticket sale.

Dunbar was interesting to talk with because of his long
career in rock. He had played with Jeff Beck, Frank Zappa
and David Bowie and has lengthy credits as a studio

. musician. -
Ft;

He said drummers always’were taking a backseat in
critical respects, and he was sick and tired of it.

Dunbar struck me as the total professional who has the
utmost conﬁdence in his abilities, while being honest

. enough to speak his mind.

series.

over Corky’s, even though it is all
going on in Corky’s mind.
Although there are several

murders, they are not really grisly"

or terrifying in depiction. This is
because that as the ﬁlm pro-
gresses, you start to feel sympathy
for Corky and want ‘to see him
overcome his mental illness and ‘go
happy life‘ together. ‘ ;

There are no real terrifying
scenes because you _don’t' fear
Corky; instead you feel sorry for
him.

turns in a superb" performance in a‘
very complex and difficult role. He

=   Panthers To Take On Wolfpack in Tangerine Bowl Dec. 23

By BOB LABRIOLA

_  pm New Staffwriter ‘
Chancellor Posvar accepted a
ormal invitation from the Tanger-
ine -Bowl ..committee in the Pitt
_ ockerroom Saturday following the
Panthers’ 35-17 victory over ‘Army.

A Posvar, seated at a table with
1 athletic director,Cas Myslinski and
ooaclrJackie Sherrill, told the voice
at the=other end. of the telephone

hookup that Pitt gladly would
accept the-‘invitation. I

Pitt's opponent for the Dec. 23
game in Orlando, Fla. will be North
Carolina State, 7-3.

“I think Orlando and the
Tangerine Bowl is an excellent
place for our team to go, especially
our young players,” said Sherrill,
munching on a tangerine. “It’s a‘,
place where you really can have a

good time, and that has been our
prime concern all along.”

The Panthers also were reported
to be wanted by the Liberty Bowl
because Louisiana State, set to be
the home team, wanted a matchup
with Pitt. Although the Liberty
Bowl offers more money and a
national television audience, Sher-
rill would have been hard pressed
to justify Memphis, Tenn. (site of

the Liberty Bowl) as a fun place for
the players. ‘

So, the Panthers will settle for
the Tangerine Bowl’s prize of
$200,000 and television coverage
over the Mizlou Network to about
80 percent of the country. The
game will be televised locally by
WPGH-TV (channel 53) with
kickoff scheduled for 8 p.m. .

The Pitt seniors met with Sherrill
last Monday to discuss possible

bowl opportunities. The seniors
listed their preferences, and,
according to Sherrill, the Tangerine
Bowl was the top choice of any of
the bowls that considered having
the Panthers.

“Bowl games are a reward for
the players,” said Sherrill. “It7s an
honor to play in any bowl, so you
can bet the team is proud of the
invitation.” '

Delaney Touchdown Sparks 35-17 Win

By BOB LABRIOLA
, H / Pin News sum Writer

_ {Jeff Delaney couldn't have
_‘picked a more opportune time for
his. first collegiate touchdown.

, ‘ Pitt was the length of the football
" way from the trailing Army, 14-0;
'.-the 45,207 fans were letting the
Panthers know what they thought
“about their performance during the
7_ﬁrs_'t' ‘six; minutes, and ‘the ‘Tanger-
ine Bowl scouts were wondering
' "hether they had made a mistake
in extending an invitation that
wasn’t based on the outcome of this
.'same»

'1 _A’rrny’s Jimmy Hill took, the
liandoff and drove into the line for
an; apparent score, but freshman
defensive tackle Jim Covert- used
his helmet to make the stop, the
ball jumped into Delaney’s hands,
and 99 yards later the senior had
-recorded the third longest touch-
down run’ in Pitt history. '

‘The 13 seconds it took Delaney to
cover the length of the Pitt Stadium
rug; changed the entire complexion
of the game, and the Panthers went

on to record their eighth win in 10
 decisions, 35-17, over the Cadets
.S’atu'rday.

0 “I think Covert popped the ball '
loose, and,it ﬂew into my hands,”
said Delaney. “At first I was a
little- confused and I wasn’t sure I
could run with the thing, but
everybody started shouting so I
decided to take off just in case.

‘ ‘If someone had caught me from
behind, I’d never have been able to
liveiit down,” Delaney continued.
“-I n_ever.ran 100 yards in a game
before, and I hope I never have to
‘ do it again."

.§;:b  Army head coach Homer Smith

.-5_- agreed that even though Delaney’s
I ‘recovery came only six minutes into

 thegame, it was the turning point.

 ’ “The fumble recovery was the

 “real backbreaker for us,” said
 a Smith. 0 “It was a 14-point play.
ii: ‘We, might have had them. I
 ‘suppose we helped Pitt get its bowl
”"fInvitation,' but. I was pretty well
"._§‘atisfied'with how well the Cadets
 -fought today.”

over three times—twice on inter-
ception's—-and two were turned into
Pitt scores, while Mike Balzer’s
interception in the end zone iced
the game and the bowl bid.

The Panthers were forced to
rely on the defense for much of
their field position throughout the
game because the offense consis-
tently was being hit with drive-kill-
ing penalties. Pitt was whistled for
10 penalties for 71 yards and had at
least two gains by Rooster Jones

"‘nWe had our ups and downs
today, but I can’t complain too

much since we finally won,” said .

coach Jackie Sherrill. “We had
some trouble getting our offense
moving; half of the ﬁrst quarter
went by before we ran our first
offensive play. Then every time we
would make a big play, 1we’d get hit

with a penalty.” -

One of the ups Sherrill was
referring to was the running of
Jones, who gained 99 yards on 14
carries and scored the game's ﬁnal
touchdown. Another had to be the
play of defensive end Hugh Green,
whose nine tackles, including
seven for losses, prompted Smith
to call him, ‘ ‘the best defensive end
I’ve ever seen.” Green was all
over the ﬁeld Saturday, but spent
most of his. time harassing Army
quarterback Earle Mulrane.

“There were two things that
pleased me today,” said Sherrill.
“One was the play of Hugh Green,
who was the most dominating
player on the field. The other was
Rooster Jones. Rooster ran just

Iikehe did last week—with

recklessness. ” — ‘

right place,” said Green. “I
haven't been making the big play
consistently all year so this game
felt especially good.”

Sherrill became displeased with
the inconsistency of the offense,
and made the switch to sophomore
quarterback Lindsay Delaney with
ﬁve minutes left injthe first half.
Delaney marched the Panthers to
the Army 1-yard line, but the
Cadets held on fourth down, and
Pitt came away empty handed.

“There were a couple reasons,”
said Sherrill about replacing‘ Rick
Trocano at quarterback. ‘ ‘I wanted
Ricky to assess the situation from
the sidelines, and I wantedhim to
take charge of the huddle. There
was too much questioning going on_
in there.” S

T rocano did not have a bad game
by any means; he completed 10 of
18 passes for 143 yards and one
touchdown, while rushing for 29
yards and another score. At this
stage of Trocano’s development,
Sherrill is beginning to look for
more than just stats from his
starting quarterback. I - .

first and second quarters, we
played to their level.” ‘
Defensively, at ‘least, Pitt played
championship-level football after
D_elaney’s recovery. The Panthers
allowed 97 yards rushing and
forced Mulrane into avnine-for-23
day through the air. ‘ Pitt was
somewhat confused when the
Cadets opened the game by going S
without a huddle but regained
control after Sherrill had a little talk
with the unit after the first Army
touchdown. ’

“I told them they weren’t intent \

enough,” said Sherril_l about the
pep talk. “They weren’-t making
things happen.”

Once the defense got on top of its
game, everything else began to fall
into place.

“This was a hectic week for our
players with all the bowl talk and
Penn State coming up,” said
Sherrill. “I still think we can play
better than we have shown this
year, and we’ll need just that effort
against Penn State.” .

Pitt News Staff Writer

INDIANA, Pa—The Pitt wo-
men’s volleyball team proved it is
the best in the East by winning the
Eastern Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Women
Championships this weekend. As
for the West, that’s still to be ‘seen
when the Pantherettes compete in
the national championships Dec. 6
at Alabama.

“We’re thrilled,” said head
coach Mike Hebert. “This is
something we’ve worked three

years for.” ‘
Pitt, seeded second -in the
tourney, is making its first

appearance ever in the nationals,

after. finishing fourth in the
regionals the past two years.

Pool play -began Thursday night
with Pitt facing Southern Connecti-

cut State College. The Panther-
ettes completely dominated the
13th-seeded Owls, 15-6, 15-3.

Host Indiana (Pa.) provided Pitt’s
next competition, but lost 15-8,
15-5.

In a match that decided the No. 1
team in its pool, Pitt played
arch-rival Penn State. The Lady
Lions played tough, but Pitt
prevailed, 15-12, 15-7.

Penn State helped the Panther-
ettes by upsetting ﬁrst-seeded and
defending champion Maryland in
the quarterﬁnals.

The semiﬁnals had Pitt against
Temple. _

“The Temple match was our
toughest," said Hebert, “but I
knew and the girls knew we could
do it.”, And Pitt did it by downing
the Lady Owls, 15-10, 15-13.

Rutgers defeated Penn State in

' min__d, ’ ’ said Hebert.

the other semiﬁnal match, which
set up a rematch between Pitt and
the Lady Knights. The Panther-
ettes bested Rutgers at the Pitt
Invitational earlier in the year in a
great comeback, 11-15,- 15-11,
15-12.

The win over Temple, besides
putting Pitt in the ﬁnals, assured
the Pantherettes of a spot in the
national championships.

A whole season and, in fact,’

years of hard work now came down
to one match, a best three-out-of-
ﬁve contest between Pitt ‘and
Rutgers.

“There was no doubt in my
“I looked
down the bench and said, ‘We're

gonna win.’ and was sure of it.” ‘
The third game was a series of

comebacks by Rutgers. Pitt ﬁnally

and championship trophy. The
ﬁnal game ended, 15-10.

The last point appropriately was
scored by Cindy Chambers, who
played a great tournament.

“What can I say about Cindy,”
said Hebert. “She was terriﬁc.”

However, the coach didn’t want
to single out any one player,

” “because they all played so well.”
He also lauded the efforts of Ingrid
Mueller who he described as
“dominating.”

“In all phases of the game, she
had to be the ﬁnest player in the
tournament,” he said.

“Naming names is difficult,”
Hebert said. “We have the luxury
of having nine players who all can
play and play well.”

. One of Pitt’s problems earlier in
the season was a
conﬁdence. Hebert said _ the
Pantherettes overcame that_ after
defeating Maryland last week.

“Knowing that we had already

Cincinnati Defense Almost 6 
. Ruins Steelers’ Weekend.   

By  Associated Press

PITTSBURGH-—Rocky Bleier
scored the game’s only touchdown
in the second quarter, and the
Pittsburgh Steelers held on despite
four pass interceptions off Terry
Bradshaw to edge the [Cincinnati
Bengals, 7-6, yesterday in a

‘National ‘ Football League game.
The.Bengals, who fell to 1-_11 in
their .most woeful ‘season ever,
. yielded just 154 net offensive yards
.. to ia Steeler team ' that ~‘ climbed to
10-2 despite. its punchless perform-

 lance. x.» h p
’ .
I ~ ,‘ ‘’Bradshaw,'who’ hit just 12 of"30
passes for 117 yards, threw all four"
. - of his interceptions in the first half.

Two of the thefts were made by
Bengal rookie comerback Louis
Breeden.

However, the Steelers managed
a 7-6 lead at halftime on the
strength of a 1-yard touchdown run
by Bleier that capped a 64-yard
scoring drive early in the second
quarter.

Chris Bahr kicked a 29-yard field
goal in the ﬁrst~ quarter for
Cincinnati and added a 48-yarder
14 seconds before halftime. His

‘.\

 i.......,-;- t»......e 

lack ’ of

‘ yard line before his pass into ,,tl1'ej'.*: 

  

helped to solve that problem,”._he’ 
said.’ , 
Many criticized Hebert for,
scheduling the Pantherettes to play”
in tournaments at Houston and.‘
Indiana University. 1 7 ‘

“It may have cost us a ﬁrst-place .  1
seed, but it helped in the long 
run,” he said. , “We want to be‘-""5.
able to contend nationally, and...»
playing out our region helped us to -5
gain some of the experience we’ll.W:
need.” V 

However, when Pitt enters into 
national competition, it will be _ a Lfij-t

- whole different world, according to 
the coach. ~. ‘ ... 

“Both Pitt and Rutgers wiIl“get' '

' blown out by the California teams, -
‘ even though we are the ﬁnest team 
ever to come out of the east,” he ..
said. The reason for this is-that "7
interest in volleyball has been »:-7‘

The Steelers followed with a" 9

pair of 21-yard receptions by John
Stallworth and ended with Bleier’s

Big Players Came Through With the Big Plays Saturday

Rarely will an entire game—and even more rarely,
a season—change dramatically with one play. There
are big plays and clutch plays, and even after one
particular down the complexion of agame may be

‘changed. But it is unusual for one play to uplift
.4 totally the winners and wipe out the losers,- one event
' after which there is no doubt who is going to win the

football game. It happened Saturday in Pitt’s 35-17
win over Army. ' ’ ‘ _

Army took the opening kickoff and, calling plays
without benefit of a huddle, marched 80 yards in 10
plays for a 7-0 lead. If Army coach Homer Smith
had been commander-in-chief some 40 years ago,
World War II would have ended in 1943.

No one on Pitt’s receiving team bothered to
recover the ensuing squib kick, and Cadet Dale‘ Love
fell on the ball at the Panther 28. Using huddles, the
Black Knights took five plays to march to the edge of
the goal line.

Boom. Pitt touchdown. Tie score, 7-7.

On first and goal from the 1, Jimmy Hill fumbled
the ball into the hands of Pitt safety Jeff Delaney.
The senior went 99 yards the other way for the tying
touchdown. It was the second longest play in Pitt
football history (three players haverun kickoffs or
interceptions 105 yards, the last one to do it in 1927).
It was t_he biggest play in the one-year history of this
Panther football team.

To the 45,297 people watching and the two teams
playing, it was stunning. ' -

After the miracle touchdown, there was r little’

doubt who would win the football game. Even when '

  Full Count

By MARK MURPHY

Army pulled within four points, 21-17, with 7:25
remaining, the sight of Delaney running the length of
the field was still vivid in everyone’s mind. A team
does not make plays like that and lose the game.

When you need the big play,‘it is the big players
who must deliver. That was the case Saturday as
Delaney, Hugh Green and Al Chesley, the heart of a
young defense, all played excellent football games.
Green made nine tackles and seven of them dropped

the ball carrier behind the line of scrimmage. He was‘

the best player on the field. Chesley made 10 tackles
and contributed a key interception deep in Army
territory that set up Rick Trocano’s six-yard touch-
down run that put the Panthers ahead to stay late in
the first quarter. Dave DiCiccio, who like Delaney,

' Chesley and all the seniors, was playing his final

game in Pitt Stadium, added 11 tackles. Jeff Pelusi,
who seems destined to anchor the 1979 defense, made
a team-high 12 tackles.

Few knew, the players certainly didn’t, that Pitt
had the Tangerine Bowl bid win, lose or tie. One

Tangerine Bowl official said sure, he would invite
Pitt if’ it loses, but he wouldn’t be smiling as much. .
Jackie Sherrill hinted that maybe his team didn’t A

want the [bid if it couldn’t beat a sub-.500 Army

team. The worries ended when Delaney’s cross-

country trek began.

So Pitt will make its fourth consecutive bowl ap-

pearance and fifth in the last six years. " It didn’t 2

ting the Panthers, but Pitt will play 13 games at the
Field House, three at neutral courts and several
others, including those in the league tournament, at
the Civic Arena downtown.

Some important features of last season's exciting
but disappointing 16-ll squad are missing; among
them are Larry Harris’s shot and Sonny Lewis’
talent. But also gone, apparently, are the morale and
discipline problems that often prevented last year’s

team from acquiring the spirit that fuels successful‘

teams .

One thing that has stayed the same is the Field
House, for which Pitt announced but did not com-
plete renovations that were to include thousands of
needed additional seats.

Grgurich hasbeen burned in the past by unbridled
preseason optimism that returned to haunt when the

Panthers proved not to be so hot, and he is cautious‘
this November.

There are no predictions of All-America players-
though Sam Clancy is Pitt’s best shot at a national
star since Bill Knight—or stunning seasons from
Grgurich this fall. He exhibits instead a confidence
that seems reasonable since his team and schedule
appear destined to parent nearly 20 wins. .

“We have a good nucleus returning,” Grgurich
said. “Every other year we’ve had .to thrust young
players into roles they weren’t properly prepared for.

“This year, barring injury, for the first time we’ll
be able to develop our team properly.”

The team that will take the floor, at least early in
the season, will include a sophomore, a junior‘ and
perhaps three seniors. This will be the first season
Grgurich has not started a freshman.

_ “It’s the first time we can combine real experience
with talented newcomers,” Grgurich said. “We’ve
won some big games, and we pulled ourselves out of
some tough situations. This is the year to take
everything we’ve learned and put it all together.”
