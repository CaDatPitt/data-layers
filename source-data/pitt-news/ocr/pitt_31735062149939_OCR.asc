Student Body Lists Preferences
In Reading Matter of Pitt News

Results of the recent poll conduct—€_v‘

ed by the Collegiate Bureau of Re-
search to discover what students like
and read in The News have been re-
leased by Chairman Larry Rothman,
C41.

The poll, which was sponsored by
the University News Service under
the direction of Robert X. Graham,
distributed ballots to 1091 students.

Most popular feature in the Uni-
versity’s student newspaper is Pitt-
pourri, closely followed by Brown
Study and On Campus. Next pop-
lar were From the Shoulder, Editor’s
Diary, Caucus, Marquee, and Per-
sonal Ads, in the order named. Per-
sonal Ads is always read by 63 per
cent of the students that expressed
a choice, but placed last because so
few students failed to indicate their
interest in this column.

‘According to the poll, news stories
of social events are of greatest inter-
est to the readers. News stories con-
cerning extra-curricular activities
placed second, and the nationality
rooms third, in reader interest. Fea-
ture stories, varsity. sports, intra-
mural sports, publications, meetings
and addresses, fraternities (social

and honorary), scholarships, faculty
items, curriculum stories, and music
ranked in the order named as the
kinds of news stories in which those
that were polled are interested.

Concerning the coverage of their
chief activity interest, 50.9 per cent
felt that it had been covered very
well, 3'7.3 per cent believed it had
been covered only spasmodically, and
1.8 per cent that it had not received
much space.

The opinion that there should be
more space devoted to news, was ex-
pressed by 61.6 per cent. The same
amount of space should be given to
editorials said 49.1 per cent, more
said 27 per cent, and less said 23.9
per cent. Fifty-one per cent desire
the same amount of columns, and 64
per cent would like to have more il-
lustrations in the newspaper.

Advertising in The News is read
by 64.6 of the readers, and 35.4 per
cent do not read the advertising.
Show advertising was the most wide-
ly read, followed by cigarette. adver-
tising. _But. almost all other adver-
tisements liaveva sizeable percentage
of readers. -

students and faculty.” ‘ ' V
CUSICK’S STATEMENT

“I intend to call upon both stu-
dents and faculty members to help
SFA put its projects over. If, at the
end of next year, it is said that SFA.
has made another failure,‘the fault:
will lie with the students and faculty
of the University. The coming year‘
will see SFA stepping down from its:
policy of aloofness and will see the
formation of a new policy, a policy
of active leadership combined with
intelligent student and faculty co-
operation with the aims of the as-
sembly,” he said.

Hoeveler’s commertt was, “The
News is an uncanny predi-cter .
If I had lost to anyone else but Pat,
1' would have felt badly about it.”

A New President
And an Old Probloin

ODAY, Student-Fac.nli_\-' Association lias a new

presi(lcnt . . . Patrick Joseph (.‘-usick liy na.nn=.

In line with predictions inadc in The News l“ri-
day, (‘»usick nosed out Jack lloeveler. indepcndciit
leader, in the voting at the first lIl0t‘tlllg' of next
yczir’s governing group. The new SFA head, who
plays hockey -in his spar-c time, skated in for the
goal through a. tough. defense. But the light. has
flashed, mid poor SFA is on its way for anotlicr
merry year.

First statement of President Cusick was a plea
for cooperation from the student body and faculty.
SPA, he promised, will with this cooperation, “step
down from its policy of aloofness."

Now cooperation is a very vague word.
it means what we hope it inc-ans . .
gctlier to effect an active, vital studcm gm'er-n-
incnt . . . we’re all for it. If, howeve , it means a
passive acquiescnce to 21 (lo-notliing policy, that is
another matter. ‘

But if

SFA, we believe, is, at present. in better posi-

tion to acconiplisli s<.miet.l.1ii_ig- than it has been
for quite a wliilc. It liias a more equal. (listribul‘ion
of seats, is coiiseqiiently more i~epi'eSe11tat.i*.'e of the

prove its worth. On the other side is :51 better-
i;l'1an-avci-agc crop of fr:1ternit_v representatives.
pleclged to the “mcrit" systeiii, if that means any-
thing.

Yippe-e! Hi yo Silver! And all the rest of the west-
ern expletivcs. A rootin', tootin’, six-gun melodrama
has ridden into town with the innocuous ‘title “Stage-
».~oac11.”

The type of picture you used to see when you paid
your ten cents worth of admission on Saturday after-
noon is now available for all to see. Instead oi’ say-
ing, “Westerns? Hmmm. Yes, I like to see ‘them to
study social types,” you can now see it at a first run
house under the guise of legitimate entertainment.

“Stagecoach”- has nothing new to distinguish it. It
with. The characters are the old familiar types: the
lady lacking virtue, a Doc liking likker, a gambler, an
embezzler, 2-1 lady who likes to scream, a sheriil] the
“Kid,” and Inclians. Gosh-amighty, there waS1i’t :..-oom
enough for them to fall on dust to bite at. The reser-
vations must have been bare for weeks.

If you’re not too much of an introvert, you may ﬁnd
yourself cheering for the hero and hissing the villain.

Arts Department Owns Frescos
By Old Italian Primitive Painters

This is the second in-a series of 9

a/rticles on the University’s art gal-
lery, dealing with its history, ex-
hibits, and permanent works of art.

By John Brosky
In the permanent collection of the

University’s fine art gallery hang
two important and valuable examples
of fresco art. ** M :

0 One, a true fresco painting repre-
sents Christ of the Resurrection,
identiﬁable by the flag in Christ’s
hand; the other, done a’secco_repre-
sents St. John the Baptist. These
ﬁgures are part of the ﬁrst gifts do-
nated to the ﬁne arts department by
an anonymous Pittsburgheru

Fresco painting is the art of mural
painting upon freshly laid plaster
while it is damp or wet, with colors
capable of resisting the caustic ac-
tion of the plaster.

In secco painting the colors are
applied under certain conditions up-
on dry plaster. This phase of art
was used in Egypt centuries ago and
was carried to perfection by the Ital-
ians. _

Christ of the Resurrection and St.
John are ﬁfteenth century paintings
taken from a small provincial church
in Central Italy. There is some indi-
cation of the Renaissance art in the
faces which are more developed than
those of the Middle Ages. However,
the ﬁgures maintain an austere sym-
bolic quality of medieval art with
colors of Byzantine tradition.

The portraiture of Christ was re-
moved from the apse, which is the
semi-circular part of the church.

:Regarding the importance of these
paintings, Walter R. Hovey, acting
head“ of the ﬁne arts department said
that they are valuable to the stu-
dents working inthel medium.

Text of Letter. . .

(Continued from Page One)

Dear Mr. Crawford:

I am submitting to you in this
letter my resignation as editor of
the General Alumni Association,
effective May 15, 1939. I have ac-
cepted a. position on the staff of
the Buhl Foundation. *

It is with regret that I take this
step, for I have many friends on
the University campus and in the
General Alumni _Association. It
has been especially glfatifying 150
work for the Association during its
present period of ‘ membership
growth. I have been most happy
at the University.

I believe you will understand my
decision to go into a kind of work
which, I believe, offers broader op-
portunities. .

I hope that you will convey to
members of the Alumni Council
my appreciation for their help to
me. To them, to yourself, and to
the other officers of the General
Alumni Association, I offer my best
wishes for a long and useful life
for the Association.

With personal regards, I am

Cordially yours,
William Allison.

the ‘announcement that the contest

dates will be formally “shaved
down” in a public ceremony on

are lacking in manly qualities; this
is their only means to prove them-
selves superior men.”

Coal Tic-up Causes

Decline in Business

Business activity in the Pittsburgh
district last week continued the de-
cline that began with the closing of
the bituminous coal mines on April 1,
according to the Bureau of Business
Research of the University.

The index of business activity, ad-
justed for seasonal changes, stood at
63.7 per cent of the 1923-25 average
as compared to 87.5 per cent in the
week ending April 1——a drop of
about 23 per cent.

The stoppage in coal production
was directly or indirectly responsible
for the slump. As long as the mines
remain closed it seems ‘probable that
the drop will continue,‘ but perhaps
at a somewhat reduced rate from that
of the past three weeks, the Bureau-
reports. .
