Amazing Kreskin DazzlesAudie11ceV

by JUDY VOLLMER

After a few attempts to
clear the aisles and amidst a
barrage of paper airplanes.
the Amazing Kreskin" appear-
ed before a rowdy audience of
2,000 Friday night.

“If I seem upset,” said the
mentalist. “I am. One thing I like
to do is develop a healthy hatred
with my audience.” Kreskin then
explained that his nervousness

 

had resulted from an afternoon in-
terview with the press.

Throughout his show. Kreskin I

performed a series of card tricks.
some extra-sensory exercises in
telephone numbers, addresses.
and zip codes, and ended with a
group session of “psychosonics. "
Early in his program,-Kreskin
asked for 9. Kennedy half dollar
from a member of the audience.
He then slammed it through the
base of a large Canada Dry bottle

without breaking or cracking the
glass. As soon as two assistants
from the audience verified that
the coin was inside, Kreskin ask-
ed them to place the bottle under
a black cloth and break it. The
same coin was left.

Kreskin then selected a com-
mittee of four people to hide his
pay check for the evening some-
where inside 120-121 Common
Facilities and he left through a
side door. promising that if he
could not find the check he would
drop the fee.

It took Kreskin four minutes to
find his check, which was placed
in a woman’s brown purse. Tem-
porarily confused, he explained,
“I was getting a transmission of
‘brown.’ but her shoe was brown
too and I didn’t know where to
look."

Kreskin ended his act with a
mass exercise in psychosonics.
Forty people jammed onto the
stage to submit themselves to
what Kreskin explains as the
“power of suggestion.”

The mentalist stated that the
people on stage were not about to
undergo hypnosis, but rely on
their powers of concentration and
sensitize themselves to his men-
tal suggestions_.VDuring the-course

Muskie Cites Eroding Confidence,
Urges 'Coalition of Americans.’

r by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Senator Edward Muskie
sounded a clarion call for the
“true discovery of our demo-
cracy" at the Americans for
Democratic Actions Roosevelt
Day Dinner Wednesday.

The unannounced Democratic
presidential hopeful from Maine
said ours is “one of the watershed
times when you and I can shape
life on this planet for billions
about to be born.”

Urging the formation of a new
“coalition of Americans,” Muskie
accused the Nixon administration
of fostering an “erosion of confi-
dence” and the “disappearance

‘' of trust.”

Mindful of the occasion, Muskie
recalled the achievements of
President Franklin Roosevelt and
compared modern America to the
depression-ridden country Roo-
sevelt saw when he took office 38
years ago. I V

Conquerable Malaise

“Forty years ago,” he argued,
“ours was a nation which had lost
its spirit.” He attributed that ma-
laise to the “failure of govern-
ment to respond to the pressing
needs of a majority of its citizens.”

Moving quickly from gloom to
hope, Muskie quoted Thomas
Wolfe: “I believe we are lost here
in America. But I believe we can
be found.”

While he noted the “aimless-
._ness, despair, and disappoint-
ment” felt by many young Amer-
icans, Muskie counseled against

, abandoning old“ values “until

at
r
u

as-

you’ve found new values that are
better.” 

He reminded youth that “demo-
cracy is not perfection," and con-
tended it is a “system in which
men and women work together for
a better society.”

Domestic Needs
Touching briefly on specifics.
Muskie urged the Nixon adminis-
tration to embrace the concept

of public service jobs for the poor .

and suggested the establishment
of a Price-Wage Review Board.

He chided the President with
the observation that “merging
departments is not enough"—re-
ferring to Nixon's proposed re-
organization of the executive
branch. He also lambasted the

. practice of wiretapping and term-

ed it an “invasion of privacy.”

Stressing America's domestic
problems, Muskie said it is easy
to “find targets abroad which
merit our attention.” But he con-
tended that the “more complex
task is meeting and mastering the
forces at home which oppress the
human spirit.” According to Mus-
kie, these include violence, pover-
ty, discrimination, and fear.

Planet's Fate
Muskie, who recently returned
from a European tour, expressed

F grief at the situation in the Mid-

dle East. He called it lamentable
that “the place which was the
origin of Christian-Judaeo, ideals
should find its people today rest-

’ less,‘ frustrated, and deprived of

 

the opportunity to live meaningful .
lives.”

Exuding a sense of urgency,
Muskie termed American leader-
ship and wisdom vital “for life on
this planet.”

THE AMAZING KRESKIN . . . . .

of the psychosonicsv session, sev-
eral people wereasked to leave
the stage because they had broken
their concentration or because
they seemed distressed.

Kreskin began the session by
asking the participants to do a
few muscle concentration exer-
cises, the first, clenching their
hands together in front of them.
Kreskin then said‘ that they would
not be able to release their grasp
until he reversed his suggestion.
He proved correct. Then Kreskin
asked the volunteers to focus
their attention on a ceiling light,
while rolling their arms rapidly
before them. Several people kept
rolling their arms uncontrollably,
while the audience applauded.

When Kreskin asked participant

V Gus Avrokatos for his reactions,

Avrokatos replied, “It’s pretty
amazing.”

Two other participants, Marc
Hiller and Mike Zonis, through the
power of suggestion, forgot their
names. When Hiller was asked to
identify himself, he could only
give Kreskin his address.

Later on, Hiller “lost” his boot, 
which he was holding right before V _

his eyes. He went so far.as to

search the audience for his “lost’ V . __ 3 ’

boot. '

Mistaking a boot on someone’s ' V
else’s foot for his own, Hiller re-A“ “  .V
moved it and tried it on. Finally, -* ‘3 4
after Hiller complained that the‘ V .- 
boot didn’t fit, Kreskin pointed  

out that Hiller"s own boot was in
his right hand.

Through his acute power of sug-
gestion Kreskin dubbed one. par-

ticipant a master of moon lan-'

guage. He then pointed out two
people who could interpret moon

language and an ‘extensive dia- " 0’

logue followed.

Before ending, Kreskin told all ‘ 

of the volunteers that on the count
of three their chairs would be-
come as hot as irons. Avrokatos

leaped about three feet into the . I

all‘.

0 Before leaving, Kreskin thank-

ed‘ the audience and extended a‘?  A

“temporary so-long.”

  Freshmanori

Revis ions Anticipated

(Editor's Note: The following is
an assessment of the various
changes and innovations in the up-
coming freshman orientation pro-
gram written by Richard Box, stu-
dent chairman of Orientation.)

Freshman Orientation is head—
ed in several new directions this
year. Probably the greatest (both
quantitatively and qualitatively)
change is the fact, that this sum-
mer’s orientation will be separ-
atedsfrom the group advising and
registration process.

For the weekend of June 18, 19
and 20 the orientation committee
is planning a “Weekendat Pitt”
for the area students, most of
whom will be commuters. These
students will have the option of
being able to pay an approximate
$15 room and board cost and live
in the residence halls beginning
late Friday afternoon and ending
sometime Sunday afternoon.

During this weekend there will
be some social. activities for the
freshmen plus some daytime ac-
tivities that are currently being
discussed. The Advising Center
will hold expanded group advising

sessions on Saturday and Sunday \

for all 1,300 area freshmen. The
group sessions are being rede-
signed to provide more helpful in-
formation and to become less of
a chaotic “appointment sign-up
battle” for registration.

. The registration process will i

take place over four one week per-
iods throughout the remainder of
the summer for these students,
the final period being in early
August. This will allow each
freshman a full hour with his ad-
visor on an individual basis.

Those resident students who
live too far away to come to Pitt
for the weekend and then come
back to register will arrive and
check in to their permanent
rooms in the residence halls on
Wednesday evening, Aug. 26. They
will begin the registration process
Thursday morning.

Friday, Aug. 27, is the begin-
ning of freshman orientation. The
commuting students will not be
able to live in the dorms at this
time, because the rooms will be

in the readying process for arriv-
ing resident students.

The orientation will run from

‘ Friday, the 27th, through Sunday,

Aug. 29, with the possibility of
extending it to Monday, Aug. 30.
The extension is still being con-
sidered. Orientation will be held
for transfer and relocate students
on Tuesday, Aug. 31; the Chan-

cellor’s reception will be on the

first of September. Classes begin
on Sept. 2.

L The cost charged to the fresh-
men for room and board for this
week prior to school will be ap-
proximately $37.75. Besides the
costs for room and board, fresh-
men will be’required to pay an
Orientation fee to cover the costs
of orientation programming.

The freshmen will have to pay
the entire cost of orientation this
year; as it stands now there will
be no additional financial support
from the University. For this rea-
son, the Orientation Committee is
planning on the structure describ-
ed here.

It completely eliminates the
need for out of state students to
transport themselves to Pitts-
burgh twice—once for orientation
and again to come in September.

It also means that they can quit
work early rather than inconveni-
ently taking time off during the
summer, although this does not
constitute any savings. Further-
more, since the registration pro-
cess will be separate for area stu-
dents, and the only part of the
Weekend at Pitt that will be man-
datory is the group advising ses-
sions, they will not be forced to in-
cur any housing and board costs
at all if they cannot afford it.

The idea behind the Weekend is
that many commuters would nev-
er experience a residence hall sit-
uation at Pitt otherwise and many
many concerned students have
voiced alarm oer the possibility
of robbing those freshmen of im-
portant opportunities to begin
their social life at Pitt.

It isthis type of concern by the
students that accomplishes a
great deal, and I welcome all
thoughts about orientation. Un-
dergraduate Orientation takes a
great deal of planning and a great
amount of time for implementa-
tion.

The committee has passed the
point of deciding what to do; ori-
entation must now begin the de-
tailed job of programming and
writing to freshmen.

The director of Orientation is
Bea Lampiris, 500 Schenley Hall.

Applications for host and host-
ess postitions during the Weekend
at Pitt and Freshman Orientation
are now available in 507 Schenley
Hall and must be returned there

' no later than March 1.

THE AMAZING KRESK|N’S emotions ran the gamut from owe to amusement Friday night.
Photos by Bob Donaldson

by POHLA SMITH

The Amazing Kreskin, mental-
ist and expert in extra sensory
perception (ESP), readily admits
fallibility. I

Kreskin spent a half-hour re-
lating ancedotes before his show
here last Friday evening. Casual-
ly dressed in a brown wool shirt
over a black turtleneck, low boots
and a pair of blue and brown plaid
straight-leg pants, he relaxed in
an armchair and laughed at the
funny experiences he has had in
25 years of working with his pow-
ers of ESP.

To always put a time limit on
“suggestions” to his subjects was
the lesson Kreskin learned from a
mistake he made on summer at a
resort in New.J ersey.

His show was in a large audi-
torium in which the walls were
screens. He told his subjects that
they would “all hear a rumbling
in the sky” after he gave a cer-
tain cue. He hinted that the rumbl-

ing might be caused by flying
saucers. He neglected, however,
to put a limit on the length of time
the “suggestion” would last.

At the cue several of the sub-
jects exclaimed they heard a
rumbling coming through the
large screens. They declared they
saw flying saucers in the sky. The
“suggestion” was so vivid to each
of them, that they argued over the
color of the saucers.

“Some thought they were blue,”
Kreskin said, “others thought
they were green.”

Distraught, several subjects
ran outside where they called the
police and the fire department. By
the time the police, firemen and
fire equipment arrived, the “sug-
gestion” had worn off. To Kresk-
in’s embarrassment, the incident
was covered on the front page of
most of New Jersey’s papers the
next day.

Once at St. Lawrence Universi-
ty Kreskin told his subjects that

interested in ob-

their dean of students would look
like a bum “who hadn’t bathed for
seven months” when he came up
on stage.

The Dean, Dr. Kirkpatrick,
came up on stage and introduced
himself. One subject called him a
liar. Six others picked him up
and carried him to the back of the
auditorium where they threw him
outside where the temperature
was 28 degrees below zero.

When the Dean tried to reenter,

one boy cried, “There’s that bunit 

again” and raced back up the
aisle to throw the Dean’ out. At
that point Kreskin broke the pow-
er of the “suggestion.” '

Dr. Kirkpatrick suffered no
serious injuries and is now presi-
dent of the University.

Kreskin says his powers are a
drawback to him when he is in a
social situation. “I learned by the
age of/18 not to use my abilities
in front of my friends.” He said
they were often nonplussed to call
him on the phone and have him
answer with “Hello so and so” be-
fore they had identified them-
selves.”

“When I’m out on a date,”
Kreskin confided, “I can’t have
her walk on my left side. I can tell
what she’s thinking, what store
she wants to go into and so on

when she’s on my left. That real- g

ly bothers me.”

His problem resulted from
training himself to find his check
when it is hidden by a member of
the audience at each show. By
having the person who hid it
walk on his left, Kreskin can dis-
cern where it has been hidden.

The 36 year old Kreskin stress— I
ed the fact that he is still a bache-
lor, _“though one can’t rule out the
possibility of marriage someday.” A

He was delighted when this re-
porter told him he didn’t look his
age. -

“How old do I look?” he asked.

“Oh, about 28.”

“That’s beautiful!” Kreskin ex‘-‘ 

claimed, giving this reporter a
bear hug, “simply beautiful.”

,, Students Support Lettuce Boycott

33

by SUE RUFFN ER

Al Estrada and Walt Panzar
hope to persuade the Food Serv-
ices Policy Committee (FSPC),
which controls food operations at
Pitt, to buy only lettuce bearing
the labe1.\of the United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC).

The efforts of Estrada, Panzar
and approximately 15 other stu-
dents are part of the nationwide
movement to boycott non-WF WOC
lettuce or “scab” lettuce as it is
more commonly called.

At the upcoming FSPC meting,
facts concerning the boycott will
be presented, as well as a peti-
tion signed by students and fac-
ulty. The petition was circulated
for three days in the Towers Lob-
by and the Student Union and con-
tains over 1,900 signatures.

Panzar explained, “The peit-
tion was circulated to show that
concern over the lettuce boycott
is not felt by just two or three

)students. Our results were over-



whelming considering the short

you compare them to the recent
SG elections.”

The meeting with FSPC, will
not be the first concerning the let-
tuce boycott at Pitt. Students
working on the boycott have con-
tacted SAGA in the past and found
them “friendly, but not willing to
do anything.”

Other meetings were also held
with working sub—committees of
FSPC. The sub—committee in
charge of non—boarding food serv-
ices recommended to the higher
committee that the University
buy only UFWOC lettuce. The
second sub—committee, in charge
of boarding food services, with-
held its recommendation, pending
further investigation.

A final decision will be made
when FSPC meets on March 2.

Pitt’s role in all this was point-

Al Estrada added, “For many

ed in the fields. They have been
without job security, pensions, or

feel it is our duty to inform others

Registration Problems

by MARLENE ZNOY

With fall registration fast ap-
proaching, disgruntled students
unhappy with slow registration
procedures, late invoicing, and
faulty grade reports have a sym-
pathizer——the registrar, Dr. Peter
Allshouse.

At a recent meeting of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, Alls-
house outlined the major prob-
lembs of registration as well as
suggestions for streamlining the
procedure.

Allshouse advocates the decen-
tralization of the Administrative

Systems (AS), the computer cen- ‘

ter for the University, giving the
office of the registrar access to a
computer which would . be used
solely for registration purposes.

The registrar stated that cur-

» rently, registration does not re-

ceive top priority from AS, which
also handles such data as re-
search programs and Universit
payrolls. -

In addition, frequent changeov-
ers in AS personnel have caused a
shre of the registration problems.
In the 10 terms that Allshouse
has been registrar, there have
been four different directors of
AS, each of whom. has taken key
personnel with him when he has
left office.

Such a personnel change took
place last fall, resulting in some
lost records and the long delay in
fall term invoicing.

An IBM 360 computer is now
available to AS to speed up regis-
tration and invoicing. Allshouse
conceded that more people have
been invoiced within a reasonable
time this term. The registrar,
however, is searching for a more
permanent solution to registra-
tion problems.

David Brewer, assistant Vice
Chancellor in charge of finance,
has authorized Allshouse to in-
vestigate alternative registra-
tion systems, should the regis-
trar encounter problems similar

to those of last term in the com-_ ‘S
L ing grade report.

One‘-step toward registration re-
form was taken when Mine Hout,
chairman of the College of Arts
and Sciences (CAS) Cabinet, an-
nounced that the Undergraduate
Council of the CAS and the CAS
Cabinet have passed recommen-
dations which would make it no
longer necessary for undergrad-
uates to go to their advisors for
drop-add slips.

Rather, students would fill out
the slips themselves and take re-
sponsibility for such actions.

(Editor's Note: On Saturday night this University had a violent racial confrontation, ‘which could possibly

The details of the altercation are still scanty, but some things are very sure: Black and White_stu-

 dents on this campus are at this moment violently uptight and ready to strike out at anyone who is their Op-
, posite in _color; and if something isn’t done to allevaite the tension now prevailing in the Towers and Quad,
' - ’i we’re goingto have a first-class, busted—head, students—hospita1ized—maybe-even-killed, race riot.

One Black student had a run-in with a White student in the Towers Lobby Saturday night, but reports

' ‘V; i {say that this didn’t amount to anymore than name calling and a few threats. Campus policemen were called

to the, scene, and tried to calm things down, but now the tension had built. The Black students felt that the

Y, there?

Anyway. so the one Black student and some friends left the Towers for a party, which was taking
place in Amos Hall, but the Black student was still boiling over, the Towers incident, pressing personal

problems, and what was later described as the “typical racism on this campus aimed at Black students.“

The Black student-., upon leaving the party went on a rampage, during which time he was reportedly
swinging at anybody who was White. Several White students were injured. Many campus policemen were
again called into the Towers Lobby, where the fighting had broken out again, and many Black students upon

The information for this editor’s note was compiled from day long interviews conducted yesterday by

 the editor of the Pitt News with both Black and White students who were either involved in the Saturday

night incident, or were eyewitnesses. No information has been confirmed by Campus Security as of this

LET'S NOT STOP WITH SATURDAY NIGHT

I I Since we are a service organization, The Pitt News has arranged with the city to have a block of
Forbes and Fifth Aves. roped off today, beginning at 6:30 p.m. for a Black-White student showdown. .
 Black students will use the Student Union as organizational headquarters and White students will use

the Cathedral. Those who just want to use their fists are advised to stay on Fifth. because weapons are al-

lowed on Forbes. ,
The Pitt News advises all participants not to try and survive the showdown for if they do the rest of

‘ their lives they will have to content themselves with comparatively boring’ jobs like: making people aware

and proud of their cultures or making this nation stop warring, feeding the nations hungry. seeing that ev-
eryone has the opportunity to an education, and hosts of other humdrum items.

If you are White can’t you try and see the things that would cause a Black person to want and exting-

‘ ‘ uish everything White and then start working to change those things‘?

Black Brothers and Sisters, can’t you finally realize that Blackness doesn‘t mean. "That which White

' ain’t?” and then start working for positive instead of negative goals. .

We all are like those Punch and Judy puppets—so intent on beating the hell out of each other, we don’t

 ‘ realize that we don’t really want to fight and we look at everything as the enemy except those hands that are

    violence:  You  Must Relate

To It In Some Manner

(Editor's Note: The following col-
umn is from the associate editor of
Vibrations Newsletter, ‘Lester Sow-
ers. lt is written in response to a
column recently printed in the Pitt
News by staff writer Ellen Ganley,
which questioned the correct social
commitment to make.)

Please accept this genuinely
honest effort to help you escape
from your exile from commit?
ment.

I think it is a fair statement of
the facts to say that we both see
society as an economy. a com-
munity organized to facilitate
production through the division
of human labor.

Moreover, I believe we both

look upon the issues that mankind «

is constantly fighting over as be-
ing rooted in one thing: the age-
old struggle over the division of
the earth’s resources and fruits.

The ‘demonstrations that have

taken place in this country in the ‘

past ten years have taught us
some graphic lessons about the
limited value of essentially non-
violent protest.

They bring about a few superfi-
cial improvements but the core
of the system then under attack
remains untouched, unamenable
and uncaring. ’

You say that you can‘t relate to
violence. But I say that you must
in some way relate to it. We all
have to relate to it. It’s too much
a part of our lives today, for any
much a part of our lives today,
for any of us not to relate to it.

Look, man has fought more
than 15,000 wars during the past
5,000 years of human history.
We’ve* had an average of two wars
per year since the end of WW II.

Thirty wars are going on in the
world right now and we musn‘t
forget that all of the nations of the
world annually spend over $225
billion for weapons.

So, like it or not, we, the people
who loathe violence, must relate
to it with at least twice the fervor
of the people who use it without
giving much thought to what they
are doing.

Violence: Students

by WADE LAWSON

On behalf of the students at this
University I would like to express
my sincere concern over the se-
curity problem and for those who
are employed to insure and pro-

. tect the rights of all students here

at Pitt. .

Over the past several months
there have been numerous in-
stances involving security offi-
cers in which their behavior and
performance was questionable.

This soon became apparent that
some of the security officers did-
n't act in the best interests of stu-
dents, and instead were obsessed
with a fear to act——a fear to dis-
cip1ine—-aifear to utilize the au-
thority invested in them, to pro-
tect the rights of all students and
property of this university.

There have been instances
where I personally was asked by
one of your officers to tell some
non-students to leave University
premises, to stop the ever pre-
sent and growing problem of ex-
cessive gambling by non-residents
and in general enforce security
when some of your officers were
negligent or should I say afraid?

_ It is my opinion that the secur-
ity officers have little or no pro-
fessional training, are unrespon-
sive to leadership, and are guilty

 

Several years ago I was in your
quagmire about commitment and
here’s how I extricated myself. I
asked myself: is the toll of vio-
lence worth the gain? And I con-
cluded that the ordinary methods

of accounting aren’t much good

when applied to violent social‘

change.

But has anyone ever bothered
to compare the violence of social
change to the violence that pre-
ceded it? No, apparently not. The
way we keep the books of history
is wrong. We don’t tally the gen-
erations claimed by the residue of
economic exploitation: malnutri-
tion, disease. and ignorance.

The sufferings of these faceless
millions go unrecorded, and are
not available to counter balance
the scales when the monumental

ravages of Violence claim our at-

tention.

We have every reason to weep
over those who have been fed into
the maw of institutionalized vio-
lence. But whatever we do we

b mustn’t overlook the muted mil-

lions throughout the world who
are slowly but inexorably snuffed-
out by reactionism.

Suppose we had the power to
stamp out all of the violence in the
world today. Do you think the vio-
lence against humanity which
status quo reactionsim is respon-
sible for will bow to anything but
a superior violence‘? The answer
to this question should be obvious.

Hence, if we honestly love free-
dom and the well-being of man-
kind, then we must consider sup-
porting rather than opposing, the
violence that brings about new so-
cial change.

Must Be Protected

of over-reaction any time black
students are involved. I also be-
lieve that if a security force is to
be most effective, it must first
have the respect of those students
whom, they are to be most effec-
tive, it must first have the respect
of those students whom, they are
supposed to protect. I don’t be-
lieve this respect exists, but rath-
er animosity for an apathetic se-
curity force.

I believe that drastic measures
must be taken to erase the nega-
tive image of the security force.
(1) The transfer of black se-
curity officers from relatively ob-
scure places on campus to the
more immediate problem areas;
i.e., the Student Union and the
Towers; (2) The immediate cur-
tailment of gambling that exists
in the Student Union area, and out-
right arrests when necessary;
(3) The removal of non-students
from campus; (4) Disciplinary
action taken against those who
refuse to perform their duties as
security officers; (5) Establish-
ment of a review board, where
students can air their gripes
against security officers.

I sincerely believe that the prob-
lem involving security and its -en-
forcement aren't caused by apa-
thy among students. as some may
be led to believe but rather the

apathy that exists within theft,‘

force.

 Peace Coming

By A Treaty

Editor, The Pitt News:

"By spreading this war into
Cambodia and Laos and suggest-
ing that American air power
might be used to support a South
Vietnamese strike into Laos,
President Nixon is flirting with
World War III and courting Chi-
nese intervention” (Senator
George McGovern, N. Y. Times,

 Feb. 19,1971).

Maybe this is what Nixon wants,
the excuse to launch an attack on
China.,I don’t think the American
people want this though.

At a time when 73 per cent of
the American» people have ex-
pressed desire for total US. with-
drawl from Indochina this year
(January 29, Gallup Poll), Nixon
and his Defense Department fana-
tics are escalating the war.

The recent invasion of Laos
makes Nixon’s plans crystal
clear, he is-“going all out for a
military victory in Indochina”
(Senator J. W. Fulbright, N. -Y.
Times Feb. 19, 1971).

Games are over for the anti-
war movement at home. No long-
er can we come together and
chant “peace now” for one day

and go home with our consciences‘

purified. U.S. imperialism is di-

' rected on a course of internation-

al catastrophe. If the U.S. govern-
ment won’t stop the war, then the

people must.

The only reasonable S0lu[l()I1 LU

.the'genocide in South East Asia

IS the People’s Peace Treaty. It
is a treaty of peace between the
people of the U.S. and the people
of Vietnam. It calls for the U.S.
government to immediately set a
date for withdrawal and get out.
It assures the safety of U.S.
troops, POW’s and South Vietna-
mese collaborators once the with-
drawal date is set.

It prescribes conditions for a
coalition government in South
Vietnam which would exclude
only Thieu-Ky-Khiem, who are
universally regarded as “trai-
tors" in Vietnam. It calls for in-

 

ternationally supervised demo-
cratic elections in South Vietnam
once the U.S. troops are with-
drawn.

But the Peoples Peace Treaty
must be enforced or it is nothing
more than another petition. Each
individual must decide how he/’
she -will implement Peace with
the Vietnames.

The People’s Peace Treaty
movement is spreading to every
sector of American society. Stu-
dents, GI’s, workers, national
minorities, women, religious
groups, community organizations
are all coming out in support of
the Peace Treaty. It has already
been ratified at Florida State Uni-
versity by more than 6-1. vote.
People at Pitt are working on
the Treaty and in so doing they

are rediscovering the power that

people really have.
Peace is coming . . . because
the people are making the peace.

Editor. The Pitt News:

Kreskin entertained thousands
of us; we had.fun and the Student
Union Board is to be commended.

The audience came away amaz-
ed by Kreskin’s powers of sug-
gestion and deft sleight of hand.
So far so good.

Many hundreds came away be-
lieving that Kreskin has ESP
mind-reading powers. Now that
the fun is over, these believers
should have more fact to go on.
So here itis.

I was one of the three subjects
for the first ESP trick. Kreskin
threw me a pack of cards tied
with a rubber band. He had me
hold the pack face down and quick-
ly look at one card by lifting its
edge with my thumb. It was the
threeof clubs. I threw the pack
back and he repeated the process
with two other subjects. Then he
asked the audience to help him

think of the cards. After much
“psychosonics" (his word), he
strained and groaned and named
the cards.

Then he told us subjects to
raise a hand if he had hit our card.
We all raised a hand. The audi-
ence gasped and applauded.
Kreskin grinned his showbiz

grin. “Out of sight,” I muttered,
completely under the spell.

But soon I developed doubts, so A

when Kreskin left the stage brief-
ly I sought out the other two sub-
jects in my trick. All three of us
had seen the three of clubs. I be-
lieve that every card in the deck,
except for the bottom card, was
the three of clubs. Hundreds be-
lieved in Kreskin’s ESP power;

hundreds had been tricked by an A

altered deck. When Kreskin re-
turned to the stage, I told him
what I had discovered. He recoil-
ed visibly and plunged into his
next routine. »

If Kreskin has ESP power, why
did he need a charlatan’s ruse?
Other ESP tricks -he performed
had bothersome elements, but I’ll

restrict this note to.the facts I '_

personally observed.

I want to believe in ESP. I hope
it truly exists. What a shame that
a paid performer perverts, for
personal profit, the quest for

truth. The Amazing Kreskin? I’d

chose another adjective.

1 Course Focuses On
Violence In Society

by IAN HEISS~

“Think back to your childhood
for a moment. Get a pencil in
hand. Write down all the incidents
you remember encountering vio-
lence. Look at the list. What emo-
tivns do you feel and why?”

Students of CAS 14, Nonviolent
Models of Social Order, recently
followed these instructions in a
session entitled: “The nonviolent
socialization of children.

The discussion was prepared by
Ann Hill and Kathy Ellis, two of
the 15 undergraduates participat-
ing in the course. Focusing on as-
pects of American childhood, fam-
ily structure, the educational sys-

,tem, and chil-rearing practices,
the student researchers asked

themselves if these institutions‘

breed violence in American youth.

The film War Toys was shown at’

the meeting, to stress how sus-
ceptible children are to even min-
or cultural stimuli, ‘such as play-
toys.

Many of the incidents that group
members remembered took place
in elementary school, either in “re-
lation to peer group pressures or
a repressive teaching system.
Several felt that the, elementary
education system must bear a
large part of the blame for our
violent society.

Dr. Steve Rosen, the group spon-
sor, warned against laying the en-
tire blame on the present educa-
tional system for the violence of

Part Five of the Report of the Chancellor,
dealing with “Finances.”)

EXPENDITURES

Expenditures for the year end-
ing June 30, 1970, totaled $111,-
943,182. \

Of this amount, 34.3 per cent
was used for instruction; 23.1 per
cent for sponsored research,
training and consulting services;
18.4 per cent for other education-
al expenses; 9.8 per cent for auxi-
liary enterprises; 5.2 per cent
for Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic; 4.7 per cent for
transfers to plant fund; 42 per
cent for student aid; and 0.3 per
cent, miscellaneous.

SOURCES OF REVENUE
The total income for the fiscal
year 1970 was $113,709,762.

Twenty-five and eight-tenths per
cent of the income was obtained
from sponsored research, train-
ing and consulting services; 19.1
per cent, tuition and fees from
students; 18 per cent, tuition sup-
plement for Pennsylvania resi-

children. Making the point that
children may have learned violent
behavior patterns before begin-
ning school, Rosen said, that it is
quite possible that the quality of
violence is something innate in a
person and that society, far from
exacerbating it, tends to control
individual violence, through va-
ried roles assigned each person.

While some participants saw re-
forming the elementary education
system as the solution, others
suggested that the nonviolent ed-
ucation of a child would make him
unable to cope with a society of
violently trained individuals.

Over the past two months the
group has researched and discuss-
ed a variety of topics relating to
the causes and possible solutions
of violence in society. In past ses-
sions the group has discussed the
philosophy of Ghandi’s Satya-

grapha, the institutional basis for -

violence in Western society, suc-
cess in setting up nonviolent coun-
ter—cultures, and the nature of
primitive societies which have
evolved without the use of warfare,

Members of ‘the group traveled A

to the recent Friend’s convention
in New York, where they attended
seminars offering training in non-
violent tactics. Recently the group,
under the direction of Joe Blasi,
held an encounter session aimed
at giving members a concrete
idea of aggression in personal re-
lations.

PHYSICAL GROWTH

Total University property in
square feet, including that of re-
gional campuses, is about 6,450,-
000, an increase of 50,000 over fis-
cal year 1969.

Of the total property, 800,000
square feet was provided by the
General State Authority, a sep-
arate agency established by the
Commonwealth to finance and
construct facilities such as class-
rooms, laboratories and "athletic
buildings.

ASSETS, LIABILITIES

For the fiscal year 1970, the as-
sets and liabilities of the Univer-
sity were the following: general
funds,‘ $29,495,358; endowment
funds, $84,591,696; and plant
funds, $196,071,567.

Coalition Helps Loners

by JIM MAC

Dave Hall, a proud, young black
sat in front of the Coalition ’71
audience.

“You know,” he said, his mel-
low voice calm and reassuring,
“I been working to clean up pollu-
tion in this city long before pollu-
tion was the thing. The way I look
at it every problem we have here
is caused by pollution —— people
polution, building pollution, some
type of pollution — and now we
have to clean it up.”

Hall, who finished third in the
1969 Democratic primary for

Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh,_

is a resident of the Homewood-
Brushton area and intimately
familiar with the problems of the
urban slum. He is involved in
neighborhood self-help and heads
a black community business.

“There’s lots of money in this
city,” he reflected, smiling, and
looking around the University and
City Minstry, “Lots of money that
doesn’t go to those who need it
because of poor management. If I
had my way with that money, I’d
have people who need jobs out
workin’ and makin’ this city into

‘what it can become. I’d let peo-

ple help themselves."

Full of ideas and plans, Hall
hopes with the support of an in-
dependent political organization
called Coalition ’71 to win the
May Democratic primary and
then ultimately to be elected to
City Council.

Coalition ’7l, formally organ-
ized in late November of 1970, has

_ the avowed purpose of widening

the electoral process and giving
the citizen a real choice of candi-
dates. Comprised largely, but not
exclusively, of Democrats, the or-
ganization gives a voice to those

v political hopefuls unlikely to re-

ceive endorsements by either of
the two parties. Men Like Dave
Hall who might not otherwise re-
ceive strong organizational back-
ing may, with Coalition support,
be more able to compete with the
party machines.

In general, the -men and women
in the Coalition are young, flexi-
ble, articulate, and deeply con-
cerned with the people of Pitts-
burgh. Seemingly, they have a
strong faith in the voter and like

Party chairman, they want to
make elected members of the city
government more responsible to
the people.

As a political organization, Coal-
ition ’71 has no official platform.
The organization’s goal is simply
to open up the electoral process.
However, most of the individual
members of the group at this
time are neighborhood and public
welfare oriented and in favor of
spening public money to help in-
dividuals.

The methods of the group are
simple and, as the members, be;
lieve, effective. Every person‘

considering running for an elec- :

tive city position is sent a ques-
tionnaire and invited to appear
before the Coalition. At this pub-
lic hearing, each candidate is giv-
en approximately 10 minutes to
present his political views. A 10-
minute audience questioning per-
iod follows. .

When all candidates who wish
to appear have done so, a commit-
tee will draw up a variety of slates
and present these to the entire or-
ganization for deliberation and
selection. The one chosen slate is
to be a balance of the various
Coalition ethnic, racial and social
groups. '

Coalition ’71 is not a third par-
ty alternative. It works within and
yet outside the party structure.
Theoretically, candidates are
placed on the Coalition slate only
on the basis of their qualifications
and acceptibility to individuals.
Once on this organization slate,
they run for their particulr par-
ty’s endorsement with the sup-
port of Coalition members.

As yet there has been no offi-‘
cial reaction to the Coalition from
either the .Republican or Demo-
cratic party or from Mayor Peter
Flaherty. However, three incum-
bent councilmen, Council Presi-
dent Louis Mason, Jr., Walter

- Kamyk, and Richard Caliguiri,

presented themselves at an early
February Coalition hearing.

Chairman Itkin expects the
Coalition to “elect at least one
member to council and very like-
ly more.” He believes that re-
cently, both parties have begun to
take the group seriously and in re-
sponse, Coalition membership has
grown and individuals have taken
a more active part in the organ-
ization.

New Discs: Some Yes

by CINDY MORGAN
Assistant Entertainment Editor

More and more record companies and performers
are attempting to mold their music after the fashion of
the new, soft, folksier themes in music, exemplified by
James Taylor, or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Folk
artists are again gaining ground, and although guitar work
must still be of superior quality, over-amplified “acid“
music seems to be on the wante.

JUDY COLLINS
One performer who has been responsible for the gain-

" ing popularity of both traditional and modern folk music

is Judy Collins. Her latest album is titled Whales and
Nightingales and has a white cover with a homey picture
of Judy framed in the center.

Collins’ album is a delightful potpourri of songs from
such well-known artist as Bob Dylan, the team of Jacques
Brel and Gerard J ouannesi, Pete Seeger and Joan Baez.

The songs range from the orchestrated “Prothalami-
un” to the traditional “Amazing Grace.” “Amazing
Grace,” already aired regularly on local radio stations,
is done in the established folk pattern. That is, Collins
sings a cappella, and later singers join her in harmoniz-
ing this hymn which has been an established folk classic.

The Brel-Jouannesi composition, “Marieke,” is sung
in Flemish, and Collins has rightly chosen to sing it with
the ori -inal Flemish flavor instead of attempting to
Americanize the rhythm. And for those not particulary
versed in Flemish, the words to the song have been trans-
lated and included on the record sleeve.

Collins, with the aid of Joshua Rifkin, presents Night-‘

ingale I and Nightingale II. Number one is a melodic folk
tune and the second is an instrumental symphony-like
composition.

The e'ery and quietly disturbing, “Farewell to Tar-
wathie” is a song about whaling.

What makes the piece so worthwhile and strange are
the background cries of whales. Believe it or not, this lends
a great deal tmthe feeling and mood of the total song.

BRONCO .

A new group from England on Island Records, distri-
buted by Capitol, is the smooth, homey group Bronco.
Country Home, the group’s first release, is written and‘
sung entirely by the five members of the group.

A game some of us played to this album was “What-
known—artist-does-this-song-remind-you—of!” Some of
the guesses were Emmitt Rhodes and the Lovin’ Spoonful.
Perhaps the closest approximation would be the voices of

1 Stephen Stills and Neil Young. The material is also quite

similar to that done by this pair.

One addition which helped give the group their own
identity was the use of the riverbank harmonica.

And although the group may not make the charts with
this release, they do appear promising, and in the future,
perhaps with the right break, they couldindeed “make it.”
However, for the present, if you wish some pleasant lis-
tening, this album could fit your bill.

NEANDERTHAL MAN? ?
Hotlegs album, Think School Stinks, is indeed, well
. . . primitive. Its popular release, .‘.‘Neanderthal Man,”

is typically "cute" and bubble-gum, and definitely would I

not appeal to the mass of college audiences. It would not
even appeal to their younger brothers and sisters.

The fare of the rest of the album would be bearable, I

but there seems to be an attempt to copy Stephen Stills.

This attempt failed miserably. As a matter of fact, the 3

whole album failed miserably.

Even is you liked bubble-gum music, you couldn’t I

bear listing to Thinks School Stinks, for the quality of

the production and mixing is poor. Even on high quality .2

stereo the record sounds scratchy and shrill. In “Nean-

derthal Man,” the drums were so loud, it nearly drowned .

out the voices. (Maybe that wouldn’t be a bad idea?)

JAZZ: JEREMY STEIG

Although you probably have
never heard of Jeremy Steig,
unless you happen to a jazz buff, '
he has been a professional mu-
sician for ten years. He has tour-
ed the world, recorded five LPs
under his own name, and done
other records with such stars ,_, y
as Richie Havens. And he has  /C, 2
set in with some of the greatest

JEREMY STEIG ENERGY

     

names in the rock world such as Mike Bloomfield, Jeffer- 1

son Airplane, Buddy Miles and Blood, Sweat and Tears.
His latest album, Energy, strengthens this man's

brilliance as a strong artist on the flute and piccolo. The ’
songs were composed by himself and another member of‘,

his back-up group, Jan Hammer.

The music on the album obviously benefits from
Steigs’ exposure and experiences with jazz over the past
‘years. And though I am not into jazz myself, I found my-

self quite caught up- in Steigs,’ rhythms and fast-paced o 

work on the flute.

Although the album is centered around Steigs’ mu-

sicianship, there is also room to mention the accompani- A

ment of the others on the album. His compositions have
allowed Jan Hammer’s electric piano and the electric
basses and percussion of other members to weight the
album heavily, much to his credit, I might add.

If you are looking for a new jazz artist to get into,
some of Steigs’ material might prove a worthwhile treat.

In the five years that Jim
Banner has coached the Pitt
track team, he has had some
good mile relay teams. Last
years team of Dorel Watley.
Smittie Brown. Carlos Reisen.
and Dennis Schatzman was no
excepion. But this year, with
Ted Bobby replacing Reisen. the
team is potentially Banners

. best.$a

In fact. on the record books it
is hisbest.

Friday night the quartet once
again showed their superiority
at Madison Square Garden in
New York City by winning the
college division race at the Olym-
pic Invitational with a 3:185
clocking. ’ I

“I think this is the best mile
relay team I have ever had,”
Banner says, “Even though they-
’ve yet to prove'it. They’ve had
some bad night’s and haven’t
been able to put four good per-
formances back-to-back.”

The victory in the ‘Olympic’
meet was the only Pitt win.
The only other competitor rep-
resenting the Blue and Gold was
Jerry Richey, who finished fifth
in the metric mile. Marty Liquori
won his 13th straight Garden run
in that race.

Winning consecutively has be-
come a minor problem for the
highly successful Pitt relay

group. As Benner says, Some-

   

f

.4 I

thing seems to go wrong every
ti ue."

The “Wrongs” have included
missed handoffs, tripping, ob-
structions by other runners. Ban-
ner thinks the Garden victory
could be the end of the littel
hangups.

"You could just say that for
the first time everything went
right," he said afterwards.

Off the track, cohesion has
never been a problem of the
members of the relay squad.

“We’re real tight,” said Dorel

Watley. “We all get together
(socially) often. “We room to-
gether on trips. We eat to-

gether, and we get along very
well,” added Dennis Schatzman.
“We care about each other, too.”

“Ted Bobby worries a lot,”
Schatzman continued. “After the
baton incident he worried about
his performance. Us older guys
prod him because he worries so
much and after things were
straightened out (Bobby now
wears glasses) he’s all right."

The four athletds seem to point
to each other for the answer to
the team’s success.

“Because we’re so balanced,”
said Watley,“It’s more of a
team effort than a one man
show.” .

The four runners are confi-
dent about the IC4A’s said the
Nationals.

“Scrappy”

Slip Past

Syracuse

by MIKE MILLER '

Dave Adams and his injury prone wrestlers limped past Syra-
cuse 17-15 Saturday, to put their season record at 8-2-1.

Gary McClure and Rick Cross scored decisive victories at 126 I

and 142 respectively.

“McClure did a very good job," commented Coach Adams,
“We thought he had a chance for a pin and he went out there with

that in mind and did the job."

Cross found himself on the
line-up at the last minute as John
Buzzatto, who was expected to
fill the position, injured his
knee Thursday night in prac-
tice.

“Cross was good on his feet,
though he was a little week at
the end. He won on take downs.“
reported Adams.

Adams also credited John Chat-
man and Jim Fleming with good
matches. Chatman injured his
shoulder in the match but not
seriously enough to keep him
out of action.

“We have to work on his ag-
gressiveness,” said the coach.

Dave Wylie won his match at
134 with a 6-5 decision, but the
coach did not feel that he

wrestled up-to-his potential.

'9.-

Adams also expressed disap-
pointment with Al Cox and Wally
Morrell. He was pleased with
Jim Caramanna and Lamar Hud-
son, who despite losses had good
matches.$a ‘

“Caramanna wrestled well and
was winning until he made a
move which lost him two points.
Hudson wrestled well even though
he lost 9-0. He was up against
their best wrestler.” Adams re-
marked.

The coach rates Syracuse high-
er than most of the teams he has
encountered recently.

“They weren‘t as strong as
Temple but they had a lot more
scrap. and were more willing to
wrestle. Cornell just rolled over
for us.“

Saturday the matmen face Penn
State, who are rated number one
in the East.

Teams P1-ohlems

“Asking me if we are going to
win the IC4A‘s is like asking
me if tomorrow is going to come."
said Smittie Brown. And Schatz-
man has higher aspirations.

"I think we have a shot to
take it all in Detroitlat the
NCAA‘s)," he said. “I think the
bad breaks are over.“

Schatzman sums up the feel-
ings of the four runners by in-
dicating that he is proud of
their achievements.

“Hell yeah. I‘m proud.“ he
said. “Were the winningest
four man team the school has
ever produced and the other
guys look up to us because of
it." ’ i

* >l< *

Richey ran the metric mile in
at New York, a time that Ban-
ner says is equivalent to a 4:03
mile. The coach, however, felt
that the Pitt star committed a
tactical error.

“He took the lead early,”
Banner said. “This put pressure
on him as the other runners
laidoff.”

The traditional rivalry between
Pitt and C-MU came to a tem-
porary halt Saturday after the
Panthers clobbered the Tartans
at Carnegie, 104-59, in the last
game between the two schools.

‘The Panthers, with their eye
on bigger competition have phas-
ed the Tartans out of their regu-
lar season schedule. In recent
years the difference in the
basketball programs of the re-
spective schools has become in-
creasingly large.

C-MU Coach James Brown
summed up the value of their
inter-city rivalry and also cited
its limitations.

“When things are going evenly
the psychology of the inter-
city rivalry can come through,”
began Brown. “It’s a healthy
thing. If you get some breaks
you might get it to last the
«whole game. But it gets silly
when you’re so overpowered, as
we were today.”

With the Tartans fielding a
squad that averaged less than
six feet tall per man. C-MU
was never able to muster the
board strength to combat the

Panther height. Paul O‘Gorek
and Bill Sulkowski along
with Carl Morris dominated

the backboards in the first half.
giving way to reserves like Rod
Schoon, Bob Cizmarik and Chris
Jones in the second.

Cold spells hurt the Tartans
because of their inability to get
the second shot. The Panthers
on the other hand shot at a 56.5
per cent clip that virtually
made them unstoppable, scoring
25 points in one stretch. Pitt
defense held the C-MU percent-
age down to 30.3.

Kent Scott got a
breaking his owh field goal per-
centage mark for one game (12-
15) when he exploded for ten
baskets in 11 tries during the
first half. The Panther lead of
55-22 at halftime enabled Coach
Ridl to play his reserves so Scott
never got back into the game.

Bench strength provided most
of the Panther scoring punch

for 12 points, Marv Abrams, 12,

“We got a chance to get a lot

Times, But Still Lose

To Syracuse Orange

by JAN FRY
The Pitt swimmers were splashed 49-64 by Syracuse Saturday

but all was not lost.

, In the 500 yard freestyle Rick Rowe set a school record’ with
a time of 5209.4 and the rest of the team swam new lows.

“We gave them a better fight than they expected,” remarked
team captain Dave Wessel. “And I’ve never in the four years that
I’ve been on the team seen such a great attitude. The times are

really coming down.”

The Panthers dropped the

first event—the 400 Medley Re-

lay and then proceeded to take

second place in the 1000 free.

z4t Edinboro

Saturday, Pitt’s womeii cagers
slipped past Edinboro State Col-
lege,40-37.

“We won by the skin of our
teeth,” explained Pitt’s co-cap-

jtain Phyllis Wojciec_howski.

Pitt took the lead early in

the contest. By the end of the

first quarter, they led by the
score of 11-1 and it seemed like

this game would prove to be

another landslide victory (Pitt
won very handily over Carnegie-
Mellon and Youngstown).

The women hoopsters held the

lead until the fourth quarter when

Edinboro tied the score and

finally went ahead by five points. '

Edinboro’s lead was cut to 33-
32 and with a minute and a
half left in the game, Pitt explod-
ed. Jan Klausestarted the final
eruption off for Pitt with a bas-
ket from the outside right corner

7which pushed Pitt ahead by one

point.

“After that it was Phyl
Wojciechowski’s game,” stated
Teammate Ellen Ganley. Woj-
ciechowski, who played the

entire fourth quarter with four

fouls, commanded the boards

both offensively and defensive-

sly, scoring some timely points

and stealing the ball three times
to stall Edinboro’s offense.$a

Successful in. his first outing as a college head
coach last Tuesday Dick Bradshaw said the feel-
ing was great. But he needed to look no further
than the line-up sheets at Trees Pool to reduce

his description to something like good, or per-‘

haps fine.

Bradshaw, who has been a high school head
coach, replaced Bill Grant as Pitt’s swimming
coach after Grant resigned less than two weeks
ago for “health and personal” reasons that had a
lot to do with five top swimmers who decided to
quit the team.

Bradshaw could have been mistaken for some
kind of savior when he agreed with Grant’s sug-
gestion to take over. When Bradshaw moved into
the top post most of the ex-swimmers became
swimmers again.

But still, the line-up sheets last Tuesday at

his debut against Grove City read “Acting Coach

Dick Bradshaw.”

Acting Can Be Difficult

  
  

 

Being the acting coach at the present might
sound better than being the assistant coach a
few weeks ago, but the newly acquired adjective
in front of his name isn’t necessarily a better
one for someone who intended to become the
official head coach at Pitt some day.

There is a little security for an acting coach,
much less than there is for an assistant.

For instance, Dick Bradshaw hasn’t received

4 any word about his future from the man who de-

cides, Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski. All
Bradshaw has been told is that he is to get the
swimmers through this headache year. It is very
possible that he could be as far away from the
head coaching job next year as his
friend, Bill Grant is now.

“Sometimes people think it’s better to wipe
out everyone when there are problems,” Brad-
shaw said Tuesday, while still savoring his first
victory. “I did want to be had coach at Pitt
some day. I came here with the idea of replacing
Bill when he retired. So our problems threatened
my chances. They still do.”

Bradshaw was the obvious choice for acting
coach, since he has been familiar with all of

the present swimmers. But dropping into the posi— .

tion, he now finds himself forced t recruit for
next year’s team without the benefit of telling
potential Pitt swimmers that he will be around
next year——since he can’t be sure.$a

.One thing that hasn’t been a part of Brad-
shaw’s work at Bethel Park High School or at
Pitt was recruiting. But after only a few days of
officially luring talent, he reported that although
he had a lot of work ahead, he enjoyed it. He
was delighted, for example, at surprising the over-
confident Grove City team in front of Grover
prospects. And he recognizes that Trees Pool
is as good as swimming facilities come.

There are those problems with the swimmers,

though. Word gets, around, and recruiting has.

probably become more difficult an assignment
for the acting coach, even if he really IS a savior.

Bradshaw admits that programs don’t change
overnight, but then again, after his first win
Tuesday he said, “I honestly don’t think the kids
remember the difficulties.”

Now if only the swimming prospects have for-
gotten. Bradsahw might be feeling great
after a few more swimming meets.“

Riflers Lose To Grovers, Scores Improve

by STEVE ZYCH ’

Despite having three members
place above a 250 for the first
time this year in one match,
the Pitt shooters suffered their
sixth straight loss 1,270 to 1,250,
to Grove City.

Grove City, a newcomer to
the rifle Conference and current-
ly tied for second place with
Duquesne, saw four of their five
top shooters shoot above 250.
Leading the squad was team cap-
tain Paul Whitworth whose 281
matched the previous week’s
performance by Duquesne’s Dave
Willard as the highest individual

The Pitt shooters were again
led by captain Bill Crooks who

' shot a 256. Backing him -up were

Howard Ashbrook (265), Tim
Schmidt (252), Bruce Barrett
(245), and Wade Robertson (242).

The three scores over 250 were

a first this year for the team.

Also significant was the fact

“I’m really impressed by the

percent of the team is composed
of newcomers. “With only four
seniors on the team this year,
I’m optimistic about the future,
as the top teams will be losing
their best shooters at the end of
this season as we did this past

Barrett felt the reason for the
team’s loss was “a lack of back-

For Frat Cager Title

Wednesday night at Trees Hall, Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma Del-
ta clashed in the Fraternity Intramural Basketball Championship game.

Both teams went through the year with undefeated records.

Fiji jumped out to an early lead on the strength of a three-point
play by Carl Luft. Kappa Sigma then pulled ahead and retained the lead
until the last few moments of the contest. Fiji-won, 51-48.

Kappa Sig, at one point in the contest led Fiji by 10 points. This lead

was mainly the result of the
shooting of Ken O’Keefe who
racked up 21 points in the first
half.

With less than four minutes left
in the half, Fiji started to clse the
gap, cutting the Kappa Sig lead to
six points, 31-25, at the half.

During the inter-speriod break,
Rick Cotter, coach of the Fijis
outlined his strategy for the sec-
ond half, geared to stop O’Keefe.

“We’re going _to switch our de-
fense to a box and one,” he said,
referring to a 2-2 zone with one
man guarding O’Keefe man to

.man.

The second half was close. Fiji
came to within one point of the
Kappa Sigs (34-33), with 17 min-
utes left in the game. The Kappa
Sigs then began to pull away only
to have the Fijis catch up once
more.

‘With three minutes left in the
contest, Carl Luft sank two points
to tie the game at 45-45. Fiji then
went ahead when Dave Krugh
made a free throw. O’Keefe was
then fouled by Krugh allowing
Kappa Sig to re—tie the contest.

With 18 seconds left, Luft of Fiji
added a point and Krugh scored
from the field as time ran out.
Phi Gamma Delta won, 51-48, be-
coming the Fraternity Basketball
Champions of 1971.

Cotter commented after the
game, “We have a full team. Ev-
ery man is a team. The Kappa
Sigs team is one man, O’Keefe”.

O’Keefe was high scorer with
26 points while Krugh led the los-
ers with 13.

Combining a tight defense‘ with

an explosive offense the Pitt
Hockey Club easily defeated C—MU

-8-1 in the Pitt Hockey Club debut

last night.

The tough defense of Glenn
Hyde, Joe Testa, Duke Schaeffer
and Denny Brown allowed only
eight shots on tiny goalie Mark
Lieberman. .

After scoring twice in the first
period, on goals by Denny Brown
and Dave Bahnson, the skaters
exploded for three goals in each
of the next two periods.

I

Defenseman Glenn Hyde, a
freshman from Massachusetts
who also plays defensive line for
the football team, ignited the sec-
ond period explosion with a rink
length rush a la Bobby Orr as he
outskated the entire C-MU team

I and scored his first of two goals.

He also had three assists. Less
than a minute later Phil Gefsky
made it 4-0 on an assist from Dave
Bahnson.

However, two minutes later C.-
MU broke goalie Mark Lieber-

Iman’s shutout bid on a power play

when Russ Wescoe banged home
a loose puck lying in front of the
stunned goalie. Wescoe was as-

Pitt Frosgh Rip Little Tartans

To Record 6th Straight Victory

by MARTY HELLMAN

For the second time this sea-
son, the Cubs found the Carnegie-
Mellon freshmen easy prey as
they bombed the little Tartans,
92-59, on Saturday afternoon.

Due to the absence of Cub Coach
Tim Grgurich, who is away on a
recruiting trip, Coach Fran Web-
ster enjoyed the easy task of guid-
ing the Cubs to their sixth victory
in a row and upping their season’s
mark to an impressive 10-4.

After the lopsided contest, Web-
ster humbly commented that
“Coach Grgurich did all the work
and I’ll get all the glory.”

Every Cub hit the scoring books
as ‘Webster was able to substitute
freely after the squad had rolled
up an early 20 point lead.

The little Tartans could not
match the Cubs on the boards be-
cause of their definite heigh dis-
advantage. Jim Bolla and Bill

Sherman had little trouble getting
rebounds in the contest as they
combined for over 20.

Bolla, who had troubles of his
own at the foul line, missing sev-
en, managed to pour in 19 points,
high for both squads. Sam Flem-
ing added 17 while Swartzman had
12. Mickey Martin, the team's
leading scorer, got 13 in limited
action.

Dexter Murphy, the only Tartan,
who was‘ effective underneath,
totalled 17 points for the losers,
while Gary Rentsch got 14 points,
most of them coming in the latter
stage of the second half.

Webster praised the team _for
their entire season’s play. “This
is the best freshman team that I
have seen at Pitt since I came
here three years ago,” he said.
“There are a few of them that
are going to keep some of the var-
sity players hustling for their
jobsf’

After the contest, which marks
the end of the intra-Oakland riv-
alry, C-MU coach John Meiser
seemed-relieved that this will be
the last time that his teams would

have to face Pitt. -

“They just have too much
height,” he commented. “If we
had just one big man it would
make a difference, but then again,
he’d probably play for the var-
sity.”

 

1 Hot in Debut    

sisted by John Davies, who made
the initial shot. Pitt’s Testa was
serving one of his four penalties
at the time. ‘

Defenseman Dick Solbert clos-
ed out the scoring for Pitt in the
second period with a goal at the .
12:05 mark, just -19 seconds after
C-MU’s only goal. Solberg was
assisted by Duke Schaeffer and
Dave Bahnson. '

The third period opened with
Bahnson, a former lacrosse star,
scoring his second goal of the
game (he also had two assists)
with Hyde and Gefsky drawing as-
sists on the play. That made it
6-1 with 18 minutes still remain-
ing in the game.

At 15:15 Pitt’s Duke Schaeffer
drew a holding penalty and the
Pitt skaters went to work. The
team not only did not allow a shot
on their own goal but continually
kept the pressure on C-MU’s em-
battled but stubborn goaltender,
Jeff Hart, who repeatedly stopped
the persistent Pitt penalty killers’
from scoring until defenseman,
Pitt’s Dick Solberg, intercepted
an errant C—MU pass and fed it to,
his partner Hyde, who was com-
pletely in the clear. Hyde sped to-
wards the shocked C-MU goalten-
der, gave a slight fake to the left,
and then fired a rising wrist shot
over the right shoulder of the
stunned goalie Hart. It was
Hyde's second goal of the night.

But the real test of the team’s
penalty killing ability came later. V
Schaeffer drew a hooking penalty
at the 8:00 mark and was also as-
sessed a misconduct when he
questioned referee Jack Benz’s
decision and included a choice
epithet which Benz did not like.
Next Tom Lang drew a tripping
penalty at 6:22 of the period, put-
ting Pitt two men short. The Pitt
skaters did not allow a single shot
on goal despite the disadvantage.
