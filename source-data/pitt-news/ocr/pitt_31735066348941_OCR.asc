University. of Pittsburgh,  Pa.

Vol. 70, No. PO‘ 9

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

An overwhelming majority of Pitt
students say the new coupon
exchange system is inferior to last
year’s football game admission
plan, according to a Pitt News
survey taken yesterday.

Of 100 students polled, 85 said
they favored last year’s plan, 12
expressed preference for the new
plan, and three said they had no
preference.

Those who preferred the old plan
generally felt the coupon exchange
plan to be unnecessary and
wasteful. .

“I don’t think it’s quite asfair as
the old system,” Den Tatarzyn
said. “Seating, being limited,
should be given first-come, ﬁrst-
served.”

Charlie Rowe said he thinks the
new system is “adding more
bureaucracy to an already over-'
bureaucracized adminstration. ’ ’

Students were surveyed in the
Towers Lobby, the Cathedral
basement and the Student Union
lobby.

One student who favored the

Most Pitt Students Malign

Coupon Exchange Program

coupon plan said he thought it was
“more ordered than before, when
it was ‘get what you can.”’

“I think this (new system) is’
more organized,” another said.

The "survey also asked students
whether they felt the new system
was fair. Sixty said they viewed the
plan as unfair, 36 said "the plan
seemed fair, and four couldn’t
decide.

"‘It’s as fair as any system there
is,” one respondent said, “because
the stadium can only hold a limited
number (of students).”

Dennis Palkon said, “It was
unfair 'to student input when they
implemented it. In other words, it’s
a bureaucratic boggle. ”

A third part of the survey,
concerning the likelihood of the
system’s working for all ﬁve
games, produced a 66% reponse
against such an outcome. Twenty-
nine per cent thought the system
will work and ﬁve per cent were
undecided.

“It’ll« work,” one student said.
“It’s just the less of two evils.”

Dorm Pinball Machines 0
May Face Removal   0

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The pinball machines in the
main Towers Lobby are an
“attractive nuisance,” and should
be removed, Vice Chancellor. for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye said
yesterday.

The lobby is a high trafﬁc area’
and the pinball machines attract
non-University people, creating a
security problem Moye explained.

Moye was referring to the high
school students and pedestrians
who use the Towers lobby as a
shortcut between Fifthtand Forbes
Avenues and create congestion
around the pinball machines.

According to Resident Student

have not received any, Datovech
said.

defending the presence of the

“In this letter we bring up that

“It remains to be seen whether

another.

Jean Kelly said although she
feels it’s working so far, "for the
Penn State and Notre Dame games,
I don’t think it'll work.”

Several studentssaid they felt
that_the 'coupo_n exchange system
is so shaky that they’d willingly
accept a pay plan to insure
admission to games.

Said one graduate student, “I
would gladly pay a dollar or two to
get into games. rather than go
through all this exchange and risk

being shut out of the stadium.”

“We take some of the burden off
the committee by answering
questions about where to get
information and when to’ apply,”
Moffa said.

To help predent students gain
exposure and also to help them
decide if they really want to enter
dentistry, the club is arranging two
lectures a month on various aspects
of dentistry.

The response to the club’s new
format has ben enthusiastic,
according to Moffa. Previously,
students attended meetings irreg-
ularly. ' . _ _

“There is good participation
now,” Moff said. “The kids are
involved and excited.” .

Ann McFadden, the club’s
advisor, agrees that it has been
greatly improved. “The club is
moving and it is offering fine kinds
of experience for those students
interested in dental careers,” she
said. -
McFadden also said the new
enthusiasm for the club is shared
by the faculty and graduate
students in the school of dentistry.
“They have been very generous in
volunteering their time for lec-
tures,” she said. “Some have
offered to work with the club in the

Dorm Pinball Machines
May Face Removal

(Continued from Page 1)
entire security system should be
evaluated.

“The pinball machines in the
Towers Lobby constitute the only
recreation facilities in the residence
halls and it is unfair to remove
them,” Datovech said.

Moye explained that residence
students could use the recreation
center in the Student Union.

“There is a problem regarding
recreational facilities in the resi-
dence halls, but I do not believe
that three pinball machines are the
key to the problem.” -

A study has been initiated to
investigate the possibility of
building an all-purpose room on the
Fifth Avenue room of the Towers,
to help alleviate the problem of
recreational facilities in the resi-
dence halls, Moye explained.

No action has been taken to
remove the pinball machines.

According to Housing Director
Tom Albert, the decision regarding
the pinball machines depends on

the RSA position.

“We're waiting for the RSA to
take action. If RSA wants to keep
the pinball machines, they will
stay. If they want to get rid of the
machines, we will get rid of them,”
Albert said.

Moye refused comment on
Albert’s statement.

“It is my responsibility to deal
with the quality of life in the

residence halls. and I refuse to
abdicate this responsibility to
RSA," Moye said.

“It is Moye’s obligation to show
now the pinball machines would be
detrimental to the quality of life in
the residence halls,” Datovech
said.

The pinball mahcines generate
$10,000 in revenue per year, which
is channeled into the residence hall
fund, according to Albert.

Pitt's Timid Unions

The decision by three unions to stay out of the Senate Council’s

 —l-3—eating the Veto

On behalf of the National Student
Lobby, I would like to‘ thank the
editorial staff of the Pitt News and

 . the Student Government Board for
 your help in pushing for the

override of President Ford's veto of
the $7.9 billion dollar Education

bill. This legislation provides

slightly less than ‘a 7% hike in
ﬁnancial aid to be made available

to students during FY 1976. Earlier

this summer. as we watched our
A tuitions skyrocket, President Ford

vetoed this bill, calling it “inﬂa-
tionary.”

With the help of students and
education organizations throughout
the country, the veto was overrid-
den last Wednesday by a vote of
379-41! Western Pennsylvania
Congressmen William Moorhead,
John Dent, Gary Meyers, Joseph
Gaydos, H. John Heinz and

 _’ efforts to undermine its fruitfulness, like those of the unions refusing to
" ‘participate, are direct reﬂections of attempts to distort the truth.

Thomas,Morgan voted in favor of A

the override. I am sure the votes of
these Congressmen were inﬂu-
enced, at least in part, by the fine
editorial run by the Pitt News on
the subject and by the Student
Government letters sent to each of
Pennsylvania’s 25 representatives.

The National Student Lobby is
your voice in Washington, DC,
working to insure equal access to
higher education, regardless of
race, sex, age or financial
resources. With the continued
support of the Pitt News, the
Student Government Board and the
students, I have no doubt that we
will continue to move closer to this
goal.

Each shot truly unique

The Land of Self-Expression

BY BILL MOORE

It seems to be the basic right of
every American citizen to take a
potshot or two at the president, and
I feel really out of it for not
exercising that right.

Fads come and go, but few catch
on as well .as assassination.

Ask anybody, if you haven’t
leveled -a loaded revolver on some
high-ranking public ofﬁcial in the
past few weeks, you might as well
give up the idea of being invited to

_ the right parties.

It is an exclusive clique, of
course, but the ranks are growing
every day.

It is silly to argue that -the
president is entitled to a life
unencumbered by amateur marks-
men with a craving to make the
cover of TIME. .

Why did he become president if
he didn't want to get shot? It is the
only real way to express one’s
dissatisfaction, since letters seem
so impersonal, and impeachment
takes such a long, long time.

Decisions to abort

It is the theory of “logical
succession” popularized, with the
help of the CIA, in Latin American
countries.

And, with all the American
frontiersepaved and street-lamped,
with in-the-forest hunting made so
simple, with safety regulations
ruining the fun of motorcycling,

and with the introduction of.

breasts, shooting the chief execu-
tive is the only way left to prove
one’s manhood. Or, in'Squeaky’s
case, to prove that redwood trees
shouldn’t be cut down indiscrim-
inately; It all makes great sense.

The idea extends, for those with
lesser statements to make, down to

the president’s cabinet, and certain ‘

Senate leaders. .

Just think what a dramatic, yet
tasteful, statement on the inequi-
ties of the capitalistic system one
could make by gunning down
Rockefeller as he enters a bank. It
almost becomes an art -form.

Or strafing Susan Ford for that

matter, in order to make the cover
of Seventeen. What a grand way of
‘pointing out the disillusionment of
today’s youth.

You see, it isn't meaningless, 

brutal violence; it is merely
constructive criticism.

Hell, you could probably solve
the Boston busing crisis with a few
well-aimed volleys at the Supreme
Court justices and Teddy Kennedy.

The possibilities are endless.

This is not to say that shooting is
the only form of free expression.
Not shooting would be equally
effective. *

If Squeaky Fromme were to
listen to a speech by, let’s say, Mo
Udall, wander by the podium with a
loaded gun, and not shoot, he
would have every right to feel
proud. It would be the ultimate
compliment. .

Americans were slow to pick up

on it, but now we are seeing the

light at the end of the barrel.
Civilized man has once more
shown his obvious superiority.

Murder by Any Other Name

DAN MULHOLLAND

In one of Shakespeare’s'plays,
there appears the line “a rose by
any other name would smell as
sweet.” This line has been used in
countless discussions and debates.
But it rings most true in the recent
controversy over legalized abor-
tions. For if the words of the bard
were paraphrased in order to
capture the essence of the,
disturbing topic, they might read
“Murder by any other name would
smell as foul!" '

in order to gain a more complete
perspective of this important
dialogue, let us examine some of
the key issues. It has been said by
the proponents of abortion that a
woman has an inalienable right,
stemming from her “constitutional
right «of privacy,” to controliher
own body.

This just won’t hold water when
closely scrutinized. In the ﬁrst
place. an abortion involves not one,
but two human beings: the mother
the baby, and therefore
constitutes interference with the
well-being of another's body.

Secondly, there really isn't such
a thing as a constitutional right to
privacy. It is a spurious creation of
the crafty Justice William O.
Douglas and has unfortunately '
slipped into the mainstream of
American jurisprudence, And even
if the Constitution did mention
such a right, it would be a gross
perversion of the original intent if it
were used (as it has been by the
courts) to justify themass ‘murder
that has occurred since 1973--mass
murder that would make Hitlerand

‘King Herod look like choir boys.

twisted logic.

Other arguments have been
offered in favor of abortion, each of
which is just as hollow as the one
before. It has been said by some
that abortion is necessary to keep
the population in check. Not so.
While statistics seem to indicate
that the present economic woes are
caused by a falling population,
even the most vehement of the
Zero Population Group would have
to admit that there are other, less
brutal methods available to pursue
the chimera of lowering the
population. .

Others maintain that legalized
abortions are preferable to the
proverbial “back room”
tions. Again,.this is a non-issue.
The solution is not to legalize the
carnage, but rather to prosecute
the illegal butchers more stringent-
ly, This line of argument tends to
convince one that a good deal of
support for liberalized abortions
comes from unscrupulous doctors
who seek ﬁnancial gain.

A third argument used by the
pro-abortionists is that it is better
to do away with the baby than to let
him grow up as an “unwanted
child." This is another exampleof

Only the most
recalcitrant ﬁends

that they may enjoy a few more
materialistic pleasures. This
argument and others like it are
merely excuses for a rising tide of
immoral conduct and perverted self
ccnteredness.

Unfortunately, the powers that
be have lent their support -to this
mass destruction of innocents. The

this respect, threw out its last“

ACLU and NOW howled that the
decision was a major victory in the
struggle for “women's rights,"
using a kind of “doublespeak” that

Meanwhile, the members of the
atheistic news media have com-
pounded the problem by relegating
the “right to life“ groups a virtual
limbo while crowing loudly at each
victory won by the pro-abortion
forces. Clearly, the situation at the
present time is one that cries out to

heaven for vengeance.

Letter to  editor

Prejudice in the Classroom

This is not a letter of complaint
(per sc). accusation or even

-disgust. I would simply like to-

make a situation known, which
exists at Pitt. which had at one time
a very harmful effect on me. and
I'm sure on anyone confronted with
it. In that light, I write to lend
support to others may find
themselves in such a compromise,
and to alert those in a position to
alter the situation.

During my first year at Pitt I took

an Abnormal Psychology course at

night which was taught by a clinical
psychology graduate student. His

 I1 name will go unmentioned, but-I

will never forget it.. Let it simply
be said that he is among the many
“professionals” who wield their
power without concern and out of
personal bias and prejudice.

His syllabus -included a class on
Homosexuality. (We all know that
Abnormal Psychology is the place
for this subject.) With that topic he
had the opportunity to really say
something. He did. What he said,
simply, was that he had "cured” a
male homosexual via behavior
modiﬁcation. He quoted a line from
The Boys in the Band, attributing
the statement to his “patient," to
show us how unhappy the

other words, he used our class time
for drama exercise. guising it as
“instr~uction." He then gave us a
demonstration in, Aversion Therapy
for male homosexuals.

I think it's easy to see what
damage an instructor's bias. as in
this case. can do. _ It set me,
personally, back a -year in my
efforts to resolve and understand
my own sexuality. The point is that
he presented no tangible informa-
tion.. No “other side" of the
question, despite the fact that the
issue of homosexuality is a’

controversial one among profes-

sionals.

His lecture and similar ones do
an “appropriate” (amount of
damage both to persons confused
about their sexuality [or who know_
they are gay] and to people forming
attitudes. I’d like to extend my
support and wish for strength to
gay persons sitting in classes like

that today. I sincerely hope that

you have the courage that I did not
have, to confront the instructor, to
refuse to submit yourself to such
oppressive and inappropriate crap.
If you do not, I truly ‘understand...
it’s not an easy action to take. But
please, do not let their theories and
cures dismay you.

To the staff and faculty I’d like to
say that that stuff doesn’t go down

with us any more. We are
everywhere. I would hope that you
recognize the changing times. As I
encourage others to question,
challenge. even threaten biased
instruction. and to watch carefully
for oppressive, inaccurate informa-
tion being passed off as academic
class material, I will always be
doing so-=1 promise!

And to the white, male clinical
psychology grad student, I'd like to
say thanks...for radicalizing me,
for focusing my anger and for
giving me a damn good reason to
become an activist. l.don't hate
you...I feel sorry for you and your
clients. '

The bus or us?-

Busing’s Defense  

In the‘ Pitt News dated Septem-
ber 12, 1975, Cal Ritchey wrote an
article entitled, “First Boston, Now
Louisville." Ritchey argued that
the school busing of children is to
blame for the violence which has
been taking place in Louisville,
Boston and elsewhere. “Sadly,”
he says, “the potential for trouble
is spreading...The question in light
of the Boston and Louisville
experiences is whether busing is
reasonable and proper. It may be
that busing is damaging race
relations to a greater degree than
can ever be healed by the
integration that busing is intended
to provide.” .

The Pittsburgh Student Coalition
Against Racism [SCAR] emphati-
cally disagrees. Ritchey’s line of
argument obscures the reality ’of
the situation; it makes a tacit
concession to the crazed racist
lynch mobs who roam the streets
shouting, “Kill niggers.”

The problem in Boston, Louis-
ville and other cities (including
Pittsburgh) is not busing. The
problem lies in the institutions of

this society which have failed to

provide equality for black people in
education or any other sphere. As

leaders of the" Boston black.

community have put it, “It’s not
the bus,-it’s us”--a fact which was
amply demonstrated this summer

‘truth, it’s no joking matter,

because VD can have some nasty
effects if it goes untreated. By
nasty I mean: insanity, blindness,
paralysis and death, to name only a
few of the long all-star list.

Okay, you might say. It's
deﬁnitely bad to catch VD. But
isn’t it even worse to get treated for
it at a clinic? Don’t they give you
injections in the heart with a
foot-long needle? Don’t they notify
your parents? Don’t dark, hooded

People, especially students, of-

right now. Being a person of high

But being a curious fellow, I

A nurse, who was even better-

her head into the room. “Number

I jumped up and followed her
into a clean white room. The door
closed behind me. Oh no.. This
was it.

“Why did you decide to come to I

The Law School Overkill  

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

When third-year law student Joe
Vater arrives at the Cathedra‘
weekday mornings, he's a lot more
relaxed and a little less sleeply than
he was on weekdays two years ago.
The ﬁrst year in Law School is the
most difﬁcult and nerve-wracking,
according to Vater.

“There’s real overkill on study-
ing ‘during the first year. You don’t
have time to do anything but
study,” he said?

During his ﬁrst year, Vater said
he spent most of his days in the
Cathedral. He'd ﬁnd an empty
classroom or a space in the Law
Library in which to read between
classes.

He isn’t the only one. Groups of
students always seem to be
crowded around ‘the too-small
tables and b_enches in the thir-
teenth floor hallway, usually
reading their encyclopedic text-
books.

The tiny ﬁfteenth floor Law
Library is packed with students
during afternoons, and a, few
dedicated workers can be found
tucked between the musty, closely-
packed shelves and old wooden
tables at all hours--it’s open 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

The ﬁrst year work was primarily
reading court cases and writing
briefs--synopses of the facts,
arguments and rationale used in
the cases. Vater said the reading
amounted to about 5,000 pages of
microscopic type and had to be
read several times.

“I’d read through the cases
twice to get a good understanding
of them and then go through a third
time to write the brief,”- he
explained.

Class time during the first year
consisted largely of the instructor
calling on students to present their
briefs to the group.

“That's the scariest thing about

the ﬁrst year in law school," Vater
said. “Sitting in class waiting to be
called on is so different from
undergraduate school where you
just sit there and somebody
lectures to you. You can slump in
the back of the room and never,
worry about being called on."

Vater said that after members of
the class got used to the procedure
for presenting briefs and became
accustomed to the ,type of
information they were expected to
draw from the readings, most of
the fears subsided.

“The first year, everyone is
prepared for class. After that
people become lax. Profs know we
don’t have the material prepared as
well. They don’t seem to call on
people as much,” he said.

An adjustment that can be rough
on law students is the switch to
year-long, rather than semester-
long, courses.‘ Vater had five
one-year courses and one semester
course during his first year.
Though a few professors gave
quizzes worth about 20% of the
grade, there were no midterms.

‘ “Without midterms, you don’t
really get any feedback as to what’s
expected. The.only feedback you
get is what you hear other people
saying in class. And that’s poor
feedback because some people
come across so much better in class
than on exams,” Vater explained.

“We have a study week before
exams and panic sets in. I spent
about 10 to 12 hours a day
studying. It’s kind of ridiculous. I
would see someone studying for 10
hours so I ﬁgured I should be
studying more. Then someone
would see me, and they’d study
more and it has a snowball effect.”

Grading in law school _ is
comparative so that each person is
evaluated in terms of the entire
class. ,That may explain the law
student's preoccupation with how
much other class members study.

Nevertheless, Vater claims the
strong competitiveness one might
expect is not visible in his class.

“Everyone is pretty helpful with
the material.

with one another until near the end
of the ﬁrst year. Then somebody
had the nerve to post a sign-up
sheet about going to the Pirate
opener as a group.

“Since then, we’ve done other
things together. We had a picnic at
the end of the.year and started
intramural softball and football
teams," Vater continued. “And
I'm sure some of thepeople go out
drinking together on Fridays. 'This
helps to eliminate the cutthroat
atmosphere in the classroom.“

Although the classroom pressure

N is relieved somewhat after the first

year in law school, the drive for_
jobs starts. soon afterward.

“During second semester second
year, the pressure was on to find a
summer job in the ﬁeld. First you
write letters and go to interviews.
After a few months of that, it’s time
to go knocking on doors.”

A few of the larger area ﬁrms
guarantee their summer interns
full-time positions after gradua-
tion, but smaller ﬁrms usually
don’t do their hiring ‘until later in
the year.

“The pressure isn't really on yet,
but by November the _iob search
starts getting pretty desperate,"

Budgets and Politics:

BY LORI VALIGRA

Russell M. Arnold, Pitt’s Harris-
burg correspondent on the budget,
directs his services toward search-
ing for University funds on the
federal and commonwealth levels
of government and knowing the
mood and feeling of legislators and
administrators on those levels.

Making members of the General
Assembly in Harrisburg and the

University understand each other,"

according to‘ Arnold, is an
important part of his job, since one
third of Pitt’s revenue "comes from
the General Assembly.

Arnold pointed out that about
$2,000 more in tuition per student
would be needed to make up for
this money if it relapsed. He
strives to keep tuition at lower
levels so the University can service
more people of the middle-income
bracket.

Both the University and the
General Assembly are‘ grossly
misunderstood by the average
person, said Arnold, who believes
this is understandable since his
opinion is based on headlines.

“The University is looked upon’

by a lot of people as a money
waster,” Arnold claimed. “Yet
neither the University nor the
General Assembly is as stupid or
lazy or laggard as both are usually
painted.”

Arnold wants to get as much

money for‘Pitt from the state as.

possible. Last April he worked
with students to provide backup

information for START-UP day, the
day when students wrote to their
state senators and representatives
to call attention to the University’s
ﬁnancial dilemma.

“But this was a one-shot deal
which was wholly a student effort.
We generally discourage mass
demonstrations as they always
produce one or two letters that rile
someone,” Arnold explained.

He said the letters were helpful,
since they showed the legislature
how many of their constituents are
students. In this case, any letter
received by a student’s own
legislator represented a possible
vote. a

“As for inﬂuencing changes in
appropriation, the letters had no
impact,” Arnold pointed out. “But
they weren’t supposed to have an
impact in that aspect.”

the people students wrote to
could vote only “Yes” or “No” to a
ﬁnal amount set up by the
leadership of the House, Senate,
Governor’s Ofﬁce and budget
ofﬁce.

“I think the final appropriation
of $4.5 million is good,” Arnold
said, “although the budget is never
high enough.”

Arnold has no’ idea about next
year’s tuition] He tries to ﬁnd-out
what the General Assembly and
executive ofﬁcers think, without
being at high-level meetings, from
people on the appropriations
committee and budget leaders.

“I try to anticipate and report to
the Chancellor and administration

  
 

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different I05, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent
educator. Practically all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.

Think for a moment what that means. All of them—even the s|owest—now read
an average novel in less than two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek IIT35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more remember
more, and enjoy more than when they read slowly. That's_ right! They
understand more. They remember more. They enioy more, You can do the same

. The University is misunderstood, as is the General Assembly, claims
Russ Arnold, Pitt’s man in Harrisburg. It is his job to understand them

both, and he does.

Vwhatis likely to happen to the

budget.

“Last year the Chancellor
predicted a $100 tuition hike before
the General Assembly came to its
decision. He allowed for a safety
factor to let students know about
the increase as early as possible.”

In order to get appropriate
funds, .Pitt needs friends in both
political parties. Pitt gets nonpre-
terred ‘appropriations in the gen-
eral budget since it is not under the
direct control of the common-

wealth, so it needs two thirds of the '

vote of each group for a majority
decision, Arnold explained.

_“We need a good portion of the
minority party on our side, so I
spend the whole year making sure
136 lights go up in Pitt’s favor.”

Arnold cited as the legislature’s
main problem constituents ‘inquir-
ing why particular students were
denied admission to the University.

Public Theatre 's Cautious ‘Menagerie’

' BY TOBI ROS-EN

First there was Pittsburgh
Then there
was Public Theatre Week. Before

,’»"*-_l_1ey consumed the rest of the
‘ "calendar, I ventured up to the

North Side Allegheny Community
Theatre to steal a peek at a classic
collection. .

Through the years it’s been
preserved and pickled, and ﬁnally
the tightly woven tale of complex
human delicacies is removed from
the back of the pantry.

The Glass Menagerie, the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre’s ﬁrst
offering of the season, set a sure
and safe path for Pittsburghers to
walk on. Perhaps a bit too safe.

Tennessee Williams’ play - ex-
plores the homelife of a mother
who lives in the past, foisting her
unwanted dreams upon her crip-

;"";pled daughter and “adventurous”

son. At the play’s close, Tom of the
present rhetorically speaks to his

sister Laura of the past and
instructs her to .“blow out her
candles.”

As he rids himself of her

tormenting image, he slips off the
emotional hook. Finally, his
obsessions subside. In turn, we as
an audience, who have been lead
through the cloverleaf maze of
human foibles, feel all-too-comfor-
table with Tom’s resolution.

But has his resolution transform-
ed into reality? Has he learned
how to love at long distance? He

,,.—-‘may have acquired some expertise,

but his mother Amanda is an

  

ignorant child. She longs to touch

her children, but instead she
squeezes, clenches, drains and
destroys. ,

Peter Wexler, Menagerie’s

space and seating designer, creat-
ed scaffolds resembling the fire
escape where Tom recalls his story.
The audience sits high above the
action, one tier stacked above
another, peering down at the
“people who live downstairs.” He
provides visual allusions to the
cramped (lifestyle that lies below. —
And what people live below!
Amanda Wingfield in all her faded
Southern glory is refreshingly
portrayed by ‘Carol Teitel. Her

thigh-spirited scamper captured the

girlish Amanda of days long gone.
Her steps rarely faltered and her
edges refused, to wilt. She seemed
to transcend the role, leaving hints
of a pushy Jewish mother in her
characterization. Her own vulnera-
bility faded into the background.
The character of Tom was

But Renaissance keeps produc-

obscurity, and this, their fourth
album, will do nothing to throw
them off their monotonous course.

Scheherazade, as you will
remember, was the last of an
illustrious line of virgins who were
taken as brides to the sultan (one a
night) only to be executed the next
morning. Scheherazade so enrap-
tured the sultan by her story-telling

1,001 nights, and at the end

decided not to kill her but to take’

her as a true bride. She is a woman

story.

The first side is composed of
three songs (they like to write them
long), all of them boring. Take
these and mix them with their early
stuff and you won’t be able to tell
them apart.

Renaissance lacks creativity, as
their choice in backup shows on
every album. They lead with, the
same guitar on every song and
Annie Haslam’s lead voice lacks
tonal quality. She sings the notes
and hits them all, but she’s not
interesting and comes off like a
choir girl. When you think you’ve
heard a Renaissance piece, you’ve
heard it--no mistake about that.

The only reason they sell is that -

their style is more classical, with
just enough rock to get their
records in the rock bins at the
record store. Their handling of
orchestration is shallow, lacking
innovation here, too, although the
latter half of the Scheherazade side
is better than usual. \

But the music has its good
moments, or else it wouldn’t get on
the presses at all. Like on the-last
album, Turn of the Cards, which is
better than Scheherazade, when
John Camp’s bass suddenly burst
forth like a sluggish fish out of
water on “Running Hard,” when

Haslam did a strong solo leading,

into the big finish on “Things I
don’t Understand,” and on this
record when the voices repeat

“Scheherazade, Scheherazade...”
for about two minutes at the end.

the grand finale (it says so right

on the album) and you’re just.

Yet in David Snell’s portrayal, he

‘Mary's’ Chorus Steps Out

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

The chorus line always has
been considered the shoddy side of
theatre--a stepping stone for eager
beginners, a retreat for fading stars
or a meagre share of the spotlight

for those resigned to second-class_

“stars” in the chorus line of

production--Little Mary Sunshine.

talent. But Little Mary Sunshine is
a step out of that tradition.
» When the Studio Theatre begins
its run of the Broadway musical at
Pitt on October 2, there will be no
strained faces in the background.
What will be evident is the
_pleasure of being an integral and
very pleasing part of- a many-facet-

‘ ed performance.

“There is really no small part in
this show,” says Linda DeRoss, an
English graduate student. Not a
cog in the machinery or part of a
gray wall framing the leads, her
part of the chorus line is a character
named Mabel, a shy‘ quiet
finishing-school girl who turns out

-_.to'have a-lot more sex appeal than

Sunshine is unique in its
determination to utilize the traditi-
onalconcept of the chorus line to
the fullest. Each member of the
line is not only a dancer, but also a
singer and a character with enough
individuality to become real to the
audience.

 

Ah, to be the star. But actors, singers and dancers here are all

This blend of the member of the
single whole with the unique
characterizations of each character
seems to be a challenge to the
students engrossed in it. There’s
none of what‘ choreographer Vickie
Paal calls “the tendency for
directors to slough over the chorus
line.” There’s too much at stake in
this chorus line.

This particular chorus forms an
interesting contrast to the view of
the dancer created in this year's hit
musical, A Chorus Line. The
disillusionment, the jealousy, the
struggle for the spotlight are
missing. Each member has his/her
own unusual reasons for involve-

make a show. , All four men and

four women in the chorus of Little ' '

Mary seem to have taken

the
maxim to heart. ~-

Linda DeRoss auditioned be-_

cause a friend didn’t want to go

alone, and dragged her to tryouts. -

Another chorus girl, Lori Grupp,

got the part on a cast member’s v A

recommendation, to fill in for
another dancer- who dropped out.

The only thing they’re concerned-
with now is perfecting those steps  ,
and enjoying their role in the A

musical.

.With less than two weeks until ,

the opening curtain, rehearsals are
surprisingly smooth. Criticisms
from director Henry Hayman are

listened to attentively, and mem= -
bers of the chorus line help each;

other with no hint of competition or

back-biting. _  I
Those not currently on-stage si ’

or whistling the musical’s amazing-
ly catchy tunes. The agonizingly

long hours of -repeating songs, _

steps, parts of steps are still going

on, but for now, at least, both cast. V

and director seem relaxed and
pleased with their progress.” A

This atmosphere is particularly
amazing considering the many

handicaps involved in . using ‘a .
chorus line, or really any dance 

mode in a Pitt production.

“There’s really no dance major I

at Pitt, unless it's under -the
disguise of physical education,_”

says Paal, pulling wearily on her_ -

cigarette. “I have to be a drill

sergeant, doing everything, show- . '

ing them everything. They’re .not

professional dancers, they don’t-

have the technical knowledge 'or'
the stamina.” Paal, a dancer since
age 12, has performed for two
years with the Pittsburh Ballet
Theatre.

However, the use of amateurs in
a chorus line has advantages. Most ;_

important is the lack ‘of unique and

deeply-engrained dance styles that

must be eliminated or suppressed

Burritos: Catch the Sound

BY DOUG GEBHARD

It would be a damn shame if
the Flying Burrito Brothers passed
through this city. and no one even
caught a note that they played.
Someone is really putting his
career on the line by bringing these
folks in, because they are so
gosh-darn good nobody’s even
heard of them.

It is a basic “rock truth” that the
Flying Burrito Brothers are the
ones that gave "country-rock the
attention it deserved. The original
members are and were legends in
the music industry and the groups

receeding and following the
Qemise of the old Burritos also are

something of a mere historical
masterpiece.

A web of musicians brought
about the FBB--a web that includes
such names as Dillard and Clark,

the Byrds, Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, —

and the International Submarine
Band. The original members were
Chris Ethridge, Gram Parsons,
Chris Hillman, Michael Clark and

“Sneaky” Pete Klinow. Each and '

and belts out “-zaaaaaaade!” until
you think your bladder will burst.
You think right away this album
was worth it, as Haslam has left
you breathless, after the audio
climax. Fifteen minutes later you
think, well maybe. At any rate, it’s'
the lack of tense moments like
these in Renaissance’s music that
keeps it from being a ﬁrst-rate

gfgroup.

' every member was proﬁcient and-

‘efficient in his, ﬁeld, and each went
on to either inﬂuence or be a part of
something bigger and better later.
Later to join them were Bernie
Leadon and Rick Roberts.

Each stage of the Buritos,
covering their four albums (cap-
tured in the post-Burrito album
“Close Up the Honky Tonks”), was
different and more exciting than
the one before. “Gilded Palace of
Sin” had simple sound and bad
engineering and also was the
purest country rock Ip put out.
“Burrito Deluxe” had the classic
“Wild Horses” and some more
rock-oriented pieces. This album
first featured Leadon as a major
player (but‘ don't ignore “The
Fantastic Expedition of Dillard and
Clark”). The “Flying Burrito
Brothers” lp was more ballad-ori-
ented and featured Roberts’ songs.

Coming" off of this album was
‘ ‘Colorado. ’ ’

“The Last of the Red Hot
Burritos” is undoubtedly a classic‘
lp. With its mixture of hardrockin’
tunes, country rock songs and
standard bluegrass tunes (with

in its own backyard the ﬁrst game
of the year, optimism abounded in

 thing went according to plan. Pitt

Richard Nixon discovered, things

Majors make it perfectly clear he'd

September. What Majors also said

. was the Panthers are entering a

.crucial stage in the season, and
what occurs is dependent on
several factors.

“We came out of the Oklahoma
game with a lot of positive
aspects,” Majors noted. “I didn’t
see a player quit out there on the
ﬁeld. We're capable of having a
very ﬁne football team, in my
opinion. Conﬁdence is very impor-

BY JIM SPANOS

The Pitt junior varsity football
team made its debut of the 1.975

\ season on Monday, and the result

was a 7-7 tie against Youngstown
State Penguins. Pitt out-rushed,
and out-passed
the Penguins, but could not
outscore them.
The Panthers’ only score of the
afternoon came on a 24-yard
touchdown run by junior fullback
Tom Sindewald with four minutes
left in. the second period.
The drive started when Youngs-
town punted the ball to the
Panthers’ 23-yard line. With
Laverga Walker and Sindewald
‘alternating carries, the Panthers
moved to their own 40-yard line.
The Penguin defense stiffened for a
moment, but Pitt got another ﬁrst
down on a pass interference call.
)On a second down freshman
quarterback Chris Legree had been
thrown for a 10-yard loss.)
Sindewald carried the ball three

_ yards to the YSU 35 on first down.

On second, the call again went out
to Sindewald, who picked up five

more yards to the 30. Legree kept '

for three yards to the Penguin 27,
then Walker gained three more

- yards to the 24.

On third and four Sindewald
again got. the call, this time nobody
could stop him. He burst through
the middle of the YSU defense
through a gaping hole. He was hit
a few times, but maintained his

a balance.

Freshman placekicker Mark
Schubert added the extra point and
the score was 7-0, Pitt.

Pitt was held scoreless in the
second half. In the third quarter,
Penguin quarterback Bill Fink hit
Wayne Jackson on a ﬁve yard pass.

Kicker Paul Banchetti added the
PAT and the score was deadlocked
at seven.

' Statistically, the Panthers domi-

‘nated YSU. The Panthers gained
223 yards rushing to 144 for their
opponent; Sindewald had 148 of
those. Walker picked .up 87 yards

Oklahoma in that both have-played
two games; the difference is

Oklahoma is 2-0 and the Indians

are 0-2. The Indians were defeated

-by North Carolina, 33-7, in their
ﬁrst game and

lost to East
Carolina, 20-0, in their second.
“The trademark of a good team
is how you play against a team
you’re heavily favored to beat,”
Majors said. “They won’t be as big
as we are; they won’t be as
experienced as we are. But they
played a helluva game against

North Carolina. (It was 13-10 at the -

half.)” A j
The facet of the game that most

delighted Majors against Okla-
. homa was the passing attack (ie
Robert Haygood, the quarterback).

On the receiving end of Haygood’s
longest throw was senior split end,
Karl Farmer, who was in attend-
ance yesterday. The Haygood-to-

Farmer aerial covered .54 yards,
and gave the Panthers their only

touchdown of the day. .
Farmer got a grading of 83%
against the Sooners, which is

outstanding. He made seven

downﬁeld blocks,

Farmer came out of the game in
satisfactory physical condition, but
a few of his teammates did not.
More speciﬁcally, lineback Tom
Perko suffered a shoulder injury,
and defensive baclr J.C.' Wilson —
received a knee injuy. Both players
may not play on Saturday.‘

A Receiver coaeh‘Bob.I.eahy made
some observation of his own about
the extent Pitt will use the forward
pass in future games.

‘ ‘For our team to be successful,”
Leahy said, “I think we’re going to

high for all

rushing; Legree‘ three; Mark
O’Toole minus one; and Wayne
Adams minus 14. The workhorse
for Youngstown was Paul Price,
who gained 85 yards on 20
attempts.

§Pitt 

The big key to it is the quarterback.

Haygood came around and played

_an outstanding game throwing the
ball, completing eight of twelve
passes. If we’re going to continue
to win, we’re going to need a lot of
effort from our wide receivers, the
kind Karl (Farmer) showed us on
Saturday.”

An interesting sidelight to
Saturday’s affair will be this;
twenty of the William and Mary
players are from Pennsylvania. The
most notable and unusual of the
Indians, is running back Lou
Biondi--notable because he's from
the Penn Hills section of Pitts-

burgh; unusual because he's 5-5,

Panther Potpourri: Pitt has yet
to score a point in the first half. Of
the 29 points scored thus far this

Booters to Wrestle
With Lockhaven Monster

BY JIM LEWIS

You've heard of the infamous
Loch Ness Monster? The terror of
Scotland?

Well, Eastern Pennsylvania has
its own monster of which to boast.
Not a prehistoric monster, but a
soccer monster.

Its name--Lock Haven.

The Lock . Haven monster has
scared many victims in the past--as
its 8-4-2 record from last year
indicates. And, as the Loch Ness
Monster reportedly has devoured
many a Scot, the Lock Haven
monster has followed suit--by
devouring the Edinboro Scots last
week, 4-0.

The monster will try to make Pit
its next victim this Thursday when
it meets the visiting Panthers in
home waters.

As with the Loch Ness Monster,
strength and quickness are Lock
Haven’s strong points. It is made
up of tall, muscular athletes from
all over the East coast who have
earned letters in at least one sport
apiece. Most of them, however.
have played in more than one sport
in high school. A

The Lock Haven offense, just like
the ﬁcititious lizard -of the lake, has
eluded many eyes eager to catch a
glimpse--only in Lock Haven’s
case, the eyes they elude belong to
the opposition’s defense.‘

Lock Haven is no "slouch on
defense,. either. Centered around

“_ Steve Panner, a great hustler who.

.». -‘\_..'....L» «Li.

seems to control the entire penalty
area in front of the net by himself,
the defense had three shutouts in
its 14 games last year and to date,
has given up only one goal to
powerful Penn State and shut out
equally strong Edinboro.

But basically, Lock Haven
concentrated on offense. As a_
matter of fact, the emphasis on
offense is so strong that ALL of its
11 starters play past midﬁeld
during an attack. Even the
defensemen.

You normally would think that

since the defensemen play so far‘.

upﬁeld it wouldbe easy for the
opposition’s offense to scoot past
them for a breakaway. Not so. Just
as the Loch Ness Monster quickly
disappears from the view of those
who claim to have seen it, so does
Lock Haven’s defense quickly
disappear from midfield--and seem
to magically reappear at its rightful
positions on defense.

Scary, huh?

Pitt coach Leo Bemis isn’t
scared, though. True, he believes
this game to be one of the toughest
challenges on the schedule, but he
is confident his team has met the
challenge before [its 1-1-1 record
against rough competition would
indicate]. He hopes the offense will
display the same ominous power it
showed against Point Park last
Saturday. The Panthers won that
game handily, 5-3. .

Maybe then Pitt. can slay th

‘terrible Lock Haven monster.

Pirates Easilyclinch
East Division Crown

BY YAIER LEHRER

Good news for Pirates fans.
The Bucs not only have clinched
the Eastern Division title, but also
will probably win the National
League pennant.

What is that, you say? The
Pirates beat the awesome Big Red’
Mahcine? Hasn’t Cincinnati al-
ready won more than 100 games
this season?

Sure, Cincinnati has won a lot of
games, Johnny Bench and Tony
Perez are having great years, and

the closest divisional opponent is ,

18 games out of ﬁrst place. But

‘there are a number of facts in the

Bucs’ favor. that could discount all
that.

First of all, there is the Pirate
pitching.In the past, Pirate fans
have winced at the thought of Buc
hurlers who 1st year had a team
ERA of 3.49, seventh in the
National League.

This season, though, the Buc
mound staff has been devastating,
compiling an ERA of 3.01 while
placing second in fewest hits
allowed, fewest home runs al-
lowed, shutouts and * complete
games. The Reds’ pitchers cannot,
compare.‘ .

Not only that, but the season
series between the divisional
champs stands at 6-6, with the
Pirates really having come alive in
that all-important last series with
the Reds. Because he was injured,
Willie Stargell appeared in only
four of the games against the Reds,
and the Bucs won three of those
four. a

Wilver is quite healthy now.

This Pirate team is not the same
club that was mowed down by the
Los Angeles Dodgers just one year
ago. There has been improvement

  

    
 

K‘

.., .\-A 5,‘;-J"-tt_w

     

also in the offensive department.

Leading the pack is Dave Parker,
who last year batted .282 and had
four home runs and 29 RBIs,
despite that he was strictly
platooned. This season Murtaugh
gave him a chance against
left-handed hitters and the Cobra
came through with a .310 batting
average, more than 100 RIBs and
25 home runs.

Another improvement
Pirate lineup has been the hitting
of Manny Sanguillen. Last seaon
Sanguillen’s average dropped to
.287, but his .300 lifetime batting
average is in no danger, for Manny
has hit well over that this season,
staying in the top-ten batting
leaders for most of the year.

The starting lineup from Sten-
net down to Hebner is probably the
most explosive offense in the
league, inlcuding the Cincinnati
Reds.

When considering the upcoming
championship series, it might be
interesting to note that the Reds’
power, although awesome, is not
unstoppable. Look at’1973, the year
the lowly New York Mets dared to
challenge the Reds in the pennant
series. _

New York won on superior
pitching and handcuffed the likes

of Bench, Perez and Joe Morgan.
The Mets scored only a few’ runs,
but-‘that was all they needed.

With the Pirates’ explosive
offense and the superior pitching
that allowed fewer home runs than
any other team except for the
Dodgers, Pittsburgh should do
quite a job on the Cincinnati Reds.

It might be advisable for Pirate
fans to start putting away their
money. They’re going‘ to need it for
World Series-tickets, ' V

between National Football League
owners and players over a new
contract broke off Tuesday and the
union said management’s latest
offer will be presented to the
rank-and-ﬁle membership for a
vote, probably on Thursday.

The major obstacles in the two
days of bargaining, as they had
been during the past 20 months,
were the controversial Rozelle Rule
and impartial arbitration on nonin-
jury grievances--two proposals the
players have insisted upon but that
the owners have rejected.

Kermit Alexander, president of
the union, said that the National
Football League Players Associa-
tion made several counterproposals
to the owners’ offer of Monday but
that the management representa-
tives rejected them.

However, Sargent Karch, the
executive director of the NFL
Management Council, said the
counterproposals were “the same
ones that they have been making
for the last 18 months.

“We developed and presented
yesterday a total and complete

’ proposal and that was ‘our best

shot,’ ” Karch said.

He said the owners asked the
players to add any proposal to the
management package and they
would consider it. “They came
back with the same seven
points...those seven points which
have kept us apart for the last 18
months.” '

The seven points included the

Rozelle Rule, impartial arbitration
of grievances, preseason pay,
representation on the "pension
board, squad size, an agency shop
and bargaining changes in the
constitution and bylaws.
Alexander said ‘the proposal
would be placed before the
individual players for them to
assess and vote on. He said the
results should be made public by
October 2. Asked if a strike was
possible, if the players reject the
offer, Alexander said, “We left
that up to the individuals to let us
know what they want us to do.”

The management offer, coming
as a result of a strike by ﬁve clubs
last week, offered modiﬁcations of
the Rozelle Rule, set minimum
salaries of $18,000 for’ veterans,

established a maximum $31,500 for  H

ance and pension beneﬁts.

Miami’s Lost Successes
Haunting New Dolphins

BY JOHN R. SKINNER
AP Sports Writer

MIAMI AP--Miami’s old_ success
formula, when it had Larry Csonka,
Jim Kiick and Paul Warﬁeld
around, came back to haunt the
Dolphins in their. 31-21 National
"Football League setback to the
Oakland Raiders.

“The one thing I wanted to see
was a running game, a ‘good
mixture,” said Oakland quarter-
back Ken Stabler after Monday
night’s victory. ‘‘I threw 15
passes, just about like Bob Griese
used to do.”

Griese, unable to establish a
running game as the Dolphins fell
behind 1.7-0, went to the air 32
times in trying to pull the game

out. He completed 15 for 191 yards
but had four intercepted, three in
the fourth quarter, and was sacked
forlosses three times.

The Raiders’ rushing attack
provided them with 159 yards and a
game-controlling 11 first downs._
Like the Dolphins did before
Csonka and his pals went to the
World Football League, Oakland
Coach John Madden noted, ‘We
didn’t throw one pass in the fourth
quarter.”

Although Griese maintained,  
“l’m/not going to panic and I don’t . , =
the i

think anybody else will,”
fullback. dominated offense that

carried Miami into playoffs the last

five years was missing. Csonka’s

replacements, Norm Bulaich and’
Don Nottingham, totaled only 50

yards.

,most pressing problems.

BY HAL BOCK
AP Sports Writer

KANSAS CITY AP--Baseball
officials gathered here for Wednes-
day's meeting of the Major League

Franchise Committee are poised

for decisions on some of the game’s

Basically, the problems are some

‘ ' ﬁnancially ailing franchises on the

one hand and some nonmajor

- league areas who are pressing

baseball for teams on the other.
The owners are itchy for action

. I and nothing stands in their way on
. the franchise question except,

perhaps, indecision.

‘Since the San Francisco Oakland
Bay Area has shown baseball
ofﬁcials it is incapable of success-
fully‘ supporting both the Giants
and A’s, it generally assumed one

 ’ i. ‘of the two clubs will move.

' Horace Stoneham has been
entertaining bids for the Giants for
some time with a reported asking
price of between $16-18 million for

I  the team and real estate holdings in

Arizona and Minnesota. The most
recentbid was a $15 million offer
by a Seattle group, it was reported
Tuesday by the Seattle Post
Intelligencer._

The city of Seattle has a pending
lawsuit involving the move in 1970
of ‘the Pilots from Seattle to
Milwaukee, where -they became the
Brewers. Unless it gets a franchise

‘for 1976, the city has assured
' baseball that it will actively pursue

that litigation.

ENGINEERS SPONSOR TALK

Courtland D. Perkins, president
of the National Academy of

Also bidding for the Giants is
Toronto, which offers a natural.
Canadian rivalry with the Montreal
Expos, an idea baseball would like
to pursue.

Then, of course, there’s Wash-
ington, also abandoned by baseball
a few years ago and assured by

T Commissioner Bowie Kuhn that it

provided by Baltimore. The
Orioles were up for sale earlier this
year and it is possible that the team
could be moved entirely or at least
enticed to play a portion of its home
schedule in nearby Washington.

The Chicago White Sox also have
been having financial problems and
there have been reports that
Oakland owner Charles O. Finley
wants to solve these problems by
moving the A’s to Chicago, freeing
the White Sox for a shift to Seattle
and leaving the Bay Area to the
Giants.

Robinson Rehired As
Angels Head Man

CLEVELAND AP--Frank Robin-
son signed another one year
contract Tuesday to manage the
Cleveland Indians and said, “I
don’t think I’ll play again.”

Robinson’s team has gone 23-ll
since August 16, battling the New
York Yankees for third-place in the
American League East after
nothing but frustration earlier this
season.

“I don’t see any reason why we
can’t play this way next year,” said
the smiling and relaxed Robinson.

Baseball’s first black major
league manager was beseiged by
phone calls from the media and
from friends as he talked about his
season as a player manager.

No financial details of the one
year contract were announced, but
speculation was that Robinson
would take a cut from his player
manager salary of around $180,000
to somewhere around $75,000 if he
decides to quit playing.

A torn tendon in his shoulder has
bothered Robinson so much in
recent weeks that the manager has
used player Robinson very little.

‘TI may have played my last
game,” said the man who is the
only major leaguér to have won the
Most Valuable Player award in
each league. “If I need a pinch
hitter and someone else is there

“I’m not said or unhappy about

pleased me is the young guys

“Guys like Dennis Eckersley

Pantherette Tennis
Begins New Season

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette tennis team
will open the season here today
against West Virginia University, a
team it met twice last season, and
not necessarily under the best of
circumstances.

The Pantherettes were slated to
start the season at the Slippery
Rock Invitational last Saturday, but
all matches were cancelled due to
therrain. If today’s match is rained
out, it will be played at a later date.

The Pantherettes had no trouble
recalling the WVU team. “What
were they like? ‘ A pain! They
really had a bad attitude and they
were inconsiderate,” Anouk Sas-
souni, the number-two singles
player, said at practice yesterday
afternoon.

Last season, WVU crushed the
Pantherettes in Pittsburgh, 5 - 0.
But the frustrations of defeat
weren’t nearly as hard as the
problems encountered in setting up
a rematch in Morgantown.

There was a mix-up in times; the

- Pantherettes arrived an hour late.

WVU refused to play them,
sending them straight home to
Pittsburgh after a two-hour trip.

Could you classify ‘this match as
a grudge game? Deﬁnitely.

“I don’t think they’re‘ that
tough,” team Captain Fran Baskin
stated flatly. “I think the reason

played tournament tennis in our
lives.”

“Last year we didn't have any
practice. We didn't drill at all,”
explained Mary Sue Ramsden.
“This year we’re much more
consistent.”

“Conﬁdence,” Baskin added.

So, the Pantherettes have

Paris and a new coach, Nancyfg 1
Gordon. At 3:30 this afternoon, the - 

question of whether it’s enough
will be answered.

“We have three doubles and
four singles. We can repeat--it
depends on how the singles do,”

Gordon said.

The singles players will be Paris,
Sassouni, Baskin and Ramsden.

Curiously, Gordon would not
announce the doubles teams,
except for the Terry Lies and Ann
Seebold duo. '

“They have good players in
West Virginia,” Gordon said.
“And we’re after them.”

Ali Defendse;

Character

Before Fight

BY WILL GRIMSLEY
AP Special Correspondent

MANILA AP--Muhammad Ali
took time out from_ his ﬁght
preparations Tuesday to nail what
he calls two deliberate smears on
his character. ' '3

He is not, he says, a wild, A

reckless gun toter. And he is not,
he says, a bigamist.

“People want to mar me because
lam so clean,” he said after a two
hour workout for his October 1
(September 30 in United States)
heavyweight title defense against
Joe Frazier. * V - , T

“First, they get on me for
avoiding the draft, then my
religion, then my name. Nobody’s
got a right to know what I do
behind closed doors.”

The reference was to Ali’s link
with a svelte California model

‘ named Veronica Persche, frequent-
o \ o .' ‘K I
ly seen in his company here and atcgg ‘gt

other fights.

At a reception given by President
Ferdinand Marcos last week for the
ﬁghters, Veronica was introduced
as Ali’s wife. Since then, Manila
newspapers have photographed
her often and referred to her as

~Mrs. Ali, with a Muslim name,

Kahlila.

“I have one wife, Belinda, the
mother‘ of my four children,” Ali
said. “Kahlila is Belinda’s Muslim
name. What do I need with two
wives?

, “There are many pretty girls in
my camp. Women are always‘
around me.

“My wife knows about Veron-
ica,” he added. “They travel
together.”

He said he resented intrusion‘
upon his privacy.

“I don’t know of any young man,

black or white, who doesn’t have a 1

girl friend on the side,” he said.
“lf I got one, it is nobody’s
business.

'”1'll tell you, I won’t worry
about who you sleep with if you
won’t worry about who sleeps with
me."

Ali, draped in a white robe, sat
on his red upholstered “throne”
and addressed himself freely to the’
delicate subject of his private life
and the gun-snapping trick which
created mild panic in the Frazier
camp. _
said, explaining his gun flashing
Charade outside Frazier’s hotel

V-earlier in the week, causing the
challenger considerable concern.‘

National Hockey - League season
only weeks away, it is time once
again to predict and point out what
to expect from the upcoming
campaign. .

‘ But first, let’s take a look at what
happened last season.

To no one’s surprise the “Broad
Street Bullies” (originally named
the Philadelphia Flyers) ran away
with their second consecutive
Stanley Cup championship. The
Flyers, proving their first Cup
victory was not a fluke, put an end
to the dominance of the so-called

Montreal, Boston, Chicago, New
York Rangers, Toronto and Detroit.

With the exception of Montreal,

nor bad and are currently a
two-man team--Phil Esposito and
Bobby Orr.

The Black Hawks are even
worse. They’re a one-man team--
goalie Tony Esposito. Raids from
the World Hockey Association have
taken their toll on the once-power-
ful Hawks. The Rangers are
rebuilding. They’ve unloaded
many of the high-priced players
who failed to bring a championship
to Gotham City.

The Maple Leafs and the Red
Wings may be worried most of all.
Already suffering from a long dry
spells, both of these tradition-laden
clubs had to completely tear down

and undergo drastic rebuilding
programs. Detroit failed to make
the playoffs, while Toronto got
swamped four straight by the
champion Flyers in the quarter-ﬁ-
nals.

The stage may be set for. the
expansion clubs to take over. For
the first time in Cup history, there
was an all-expansion ﬁnal series--
the nine-year old Flyers against the

five-year old Buffalo Sabres.’

Montreal was the only established
team to make even the semi-ﬁnals,
joined by the surprising New York
Islanders, a mere three-year-old
team.

Another upstart, the Vancouver
Canucks, edged out Chicago and
the St. Louis Blues to win the
Smythe Division, while the Los

Angeles Kings finished only eight V

points behind the champion Cana-
diens in the Norris Division. The
Pittsbur h Penguins, loaded with
nine 2 -goal scorers, also are
going to be heard from this season.
There were a few surprising
players around the league, but the
awards went to the same old
familiar names.» Bobby Clarke
grabbed his second Hart Trophy as
the league’s most valuable player,
guiding the Flyers through their
title defense. Clarke set up 89 goals
to tie the league lead for assists
with perennial leader Bobby Orr.
Orr ran off with his usual two
trophies--the Norris for‘ the top
defenseman and the Art Ross for
being the NHL scoring champ. Orr
has won the Norris Trophy so many

. times that the league might as well

drop the first and the last two
letters in the award’s name. Orr
scored 46 goals last season and
helped on 89 others for 135 points.
Another double-award-winner
was the Flyers‘ super goalie Bernie
Parent. Parent’s 2.03 goals-against
average easily won the Vezina
Trophy given to the team that

season. Bernie also captured the
Conn Smythe Trophy for the most
valuable player in the playoffs with
his, near-perfect performances in
goal.

Eric Vail won the Calder Trophy
.as rookie of the year though it could
have been given to any of three
novice players." Vail scored 60
points for the Atlanta Flames with
39 coming on goals, a high mark for
rookies. Pittsburgh’s Pierre La-
rouche racked up 68 points while
Danny Gare of Buffalo totaled 62.

The most gentlemanly player
award went to Marcel Dionne,
formerly a Red Wing, now an LA
King. Dionne captured the Lady
Byng Trophy by scoring 121 points
while acquiring only 14 minutes in
penalties all season. I

Boston’s Phil Esposito did his
usual thing--putting the puck in the
net. Espo tallied 61 goals to lead
the league in that department and
also set up 66 others. Joining
Esposito in reaching the 50-goal

‘plateau were Montreal’s Guy

Lafleur (53) and Detroit’s Danny
Grant (50). I _
With his 2.24 goals against
average, the King’s Rogie Vachon
joined Parent as one of the league’s
premier netminders. Ken Dryden
of Montreal (2.69), Tony Esposito
(2.74) and Billy Smith of the New

York Islanders (2.78) led the corps
of goaltenders who saw action in 50
or more games.

Dave,Shultz did his thingtoo. . '

The Philadelphia bad man sat out~a

record 472 minutes in penalties or‘

approximately eight full games.
Teammate Andre “Moose” Du-
pont joined him for 276 minutes to

give the Flyers the team lead in V I

penalties once again. Philly skaters
were punished an average of 24.6
minutes per game, nine more than
the next team.

The Flyers have been severely"

criticized for employing» their
rough-house tactics and taking the
arts of passing and skating from
the game. Yet the other teams are
following and hockey may be

headed for trouble. The Dave A

Forbes incident indeed can be
labeled a highlight of last season.

Forbes broke hockey’s cardinal’

rule by swinging his stick at the
head of an opposing player and got
away practically scot-free, though
tried for assault before a- jury.

Henry Boucha, the victim, was‘..

lucky to get away alive. -

The Flyers proved a rough,
hard-hitting, free-swinging team
can beat an artistic team any day of
the week, especially in April when
it counts. ' '
