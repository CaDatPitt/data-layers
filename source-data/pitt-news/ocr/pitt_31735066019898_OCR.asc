UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Student
calls for

protest
of OSA

By Jana Gordon
For The Pitt News

and

Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

Though dry.rush has cometo a
close, the controversy will continue.

Tony Defiore, a member of the Phi .

Gamma Delta fraternity, has sched-
uled a demonstration for 1 p.m. this
afternoon to protest recent actions by
the Office of Student Activities.

”All I want is for them to pay us lip-

service,” said Defiore. ”Our fight is
that the Office of Student Activities
will not work with us [the student
population]/’

Defiore said he has three major
problems with both recent and past
action by the university. He disagrees
first with the implemention of the dry
rush policy. He also said university
treatment of sororities and student in-
volvement with the issue of divest-
ment is unjust.

”l have been at this university for
five years and have served on the
Inter-Fraternity Council," he said.
”During those times l have seen
countless unilateral decisions being
made on the part of the Office of Stu-
dent Activities.”

Joyce Giangarlo, acting director of
the OSA, said students are involved
in every policy decision made.

”Our purpose is to work with and
assist student organizations,” said
Giangarlo. ’’If we were to disregard
student opinion, it would be against
thegbasic goal of this office."

Defiore said the ’’straw that broke
the camel's back” was the recent
sanctions placed on the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity for violating dry rush.
Those sanctions have not been an-
nounced since the case is being ap-
pealed.

”We’re all for dry rush,” he said.
”lt’s just that there are no minimum
and maximum sanctions.”

Giangarlo said the OSA looks at in-
dividual cases and there _can be no
standard sanctions because each case
is different.

”The decisions made on sanctions
are historically correct,” she said.
”We look at the history of a particular
case and determine what the sanc-
tions will be on the basis of similar
cases in the past.

”All decisions are based on factual
information. I didn't come up with
something that has no justification.”

Defiore said the demonstration
does not involve only dry rush.

”l was tired of the Office of Student
Activities ignoring student opinions,”
he said. ”They just say, ‘It's over.
You're going to do what we tell you
to do.’ ”

Defiore said he hopes to get many
of the Creek organizations and the
Black Action Society to support the
demonstration. He also said there are
four other students involved with the
planning of the event but they did not
wish to comment.

Giangarlo said she was not aware
the demonstration was scheduled un-
til she was contacted by The Pitt
News.

Pitt prof says U.S. deports
Salvadorans to their death

By Frances Sansig -
Staff Writer —

At a Sanctuary Movement forum
Wednesday night, Jules Lobel, a pro-
fessor of International and Constitu-
tional Law at Pitt, said that last year
the United States was the only coun-
try in the world that was deporting
Salvadorans back to their home coun-
try. According to Lobel, the United
States is ”thereby condemning
thousands of people to death.”

The forum was sponsored by
Carnegie Mellon University Peace
Alliance and Central America
Mobilization Committee in order to

make the public aware of the plight
of the refugees in countries such as
El Salvador and Nicaragua.

The continuing war in Central
America has had an effect on the peo-
ple. ”Any time you leave your home
in El Salvador now, you become

Students

The awards for the fourth annual
Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching
Award will be presented at the 1987
Honors Convocation on February 25.“

These are the only university-wide
awards for teaching excellence and
are the highest honors that are given
to faculty members for their teaching
excellence.

Nominations of faculty members
will be accepted from faculty col-
leagues, alumni, deans, officially
recognized student organizations and
ad hoc groups of five or more
students. Faculty members in all
schools are eligible.

The awards are made possible by
a recent Capital Fund Campaign. A

suspects,” said Art McDonald, a
Ph.D. candidate in the religious
studies department at Pitt.

The Sanctuary Movement was cre-
ated to protect Central American
political refugees from the inevitable
death or imprisonment awaiting them
in their native land. Since 1986, over
300 sanctuaries have been declared
in the United States. '

Granting refugees political sanc-
tuary is technically an infraction of
the law because it aids in the harbor-
ing of illegal aliens. But, McDonald
allowed, ”sanctuary is two-pronged;
it's humanitarian  but it also has a
political dimension to it.”

Lobel reinforced this idea by say-
ing that if the U.S. government acts
in a way which violates human rights,
then every individual is obligated to
do something to change that.

Lobel explained that it is extreme-
ly difficult for refugees to leave Cen-

tral America because in order to gain ~

maximum of eight faculty members
will be recipients of the teaching
awards this year.

To be considered by the judging
board, the nominations must be
typewritten, at least 500 words but
not more that two pages, single spac-
ed and should be sent to the Office
of Faculty Development at 3600 CL."
The nomination s_hould state the
nature of affiliation that the
nominators have had with the facul-
ty member and be signed by all of the
persons submitting it. The address
and telephone number of the submit-
ting group should be included.

Nominations from officially
recognized student groups should be

cused of persecuting someone must
submit affidavits. The likelihood of
that happening, he said, is small.

Immigration quotas were de-
creased dramatically after World War
II and again at the height of the
McCarthy era in 1952.

He remarked that at the_time of the
McCarthy era, only one slot in 100
was available to people who wanted
to immigrate to the United States. A
governmental mandate made it possi-
ble for the persecuted to flee their
countries, but according to Lobel, the

mandate is only practiced ”if you're '

from Eastern Europe, the Soviet
Union, China and the Middle East.”

Supporters of the Sanctuary Move-
ment said that the message of the
people of Central America is clear.
They want the United States to cease
military aid and to relieve them of the
death, hunger and destruction that
plagues them.

The nomination should show clear-

comeback.

By William Young

Sta ff Writer

The decline and near-fall of Pitt's 7
Young Democrats Club in the past‘:
few years can be attributed to the rise ;:
of Ronald Reagan and an ensuing-9
mood of campus conservatism, said}
Dan Taylor, president of the Young
Democrats Club, Wednesday night at 
their organizational meeting.)

”The Young Democrats Club was
very active in the late ’70s,” Tayl’o.r_.'
said/“and then Reagan took over and
the campus became conservative and
the club dwindled to the _point where"

I was the only member. I sort of in-
herited the club.” '

The new Young Democrats Club is 
bent on becoming more active and it 
supportive of the Democratic Party. _l
The Young Democrats feel that their
party now has a list of the best can-
didates to run for office in years.» .

”There is now a better set of can- f T" if

didates in the Democratic Party that ; ‘
can, if they act together, pass some?
legislation that will be helpful to us,_”
Young Democrats advisor Michael .
Margolis said. '

. One of the candidates that the club J ”
is supporting i_s__Senate hopeful Bob‘-"“”
Edgar, who was represented at the "
meeting by John Feffer. Feffer said i
that college students can play a role ‘
in the election of candidates to office.

He solicited help from thej"._
‘members, asking that they donate T
some time to aid. in Edgar_’s»
campaign. . *

’’Edgar doesn't have the money for 
too many television commercials or _ ’
radio ads, so we have to do hard and 
heavy hitting,” Feffer said. ,”We’re
not going to finesse people into
voting for Edgar; we want to go out
there and tell them about him. We_{
have to pound the sidewalk and
"make phone calls to inform people."

Taylor noted that the Young , ._
Democrats will be able to help in
campaigns and become more active _ 
on campus now that they have '
received a budget allowance from the ‘ -
student government board. In addi-
tion, the statewide Young Democrats  5
Clubs have offered their support to 
aid them in their reforming. *

lRehnquist confirmed as 16th U.S. chief justice

  

 

quist became the nation's 16th Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court late
Wednesday, with the Senate voting
65-33 to confirm him. The Senate
also confirmed Antonin Scalia to take
’Rehnquist’s former post as associate

‘:7’? _ justice by a unanimous vote of 98-0.

Despite the large margin of victory
for Rehnquist, he received the largest
number of negative votes of any suc-
cessful Supreme Court nominee in
history.

Many Democrats were quick to
"condemn Rehnquist’s confirmation,
and some called it ”a sad night for
America.” V

Republican Robert Dole, the
Senate majority leader called the anti-
Rehnquist forces ”a lynch mob,” and
telephoned President Reagan to in-
form him of his victory.

Pennsylvania Senators-John Heinz
and Arlen Specter, both Republicans,
voted for Rehnquist’s confirmation.

Arab extremists
threaten Americans

PARIS — Following a bombing that
left five people dead and nearly 50
people injured, Arab extremists, who
claimed responsibility, threatened to
extend their terror campaign to the
United States. -

Political Prisoners warned, ”We will
soon meet your vulnerable state. We
will get acquainted with your cities,

American streets will know us soon.”

The group has claimed respon-
sibility for all five recent bombings,
which have been responsible for the

 Self-defense

Pitt students learning martial arts

By Craig Pearson
Staff Writer

Everyday, stories of assaults, attacks
and rapes fill the news media. These
accounts strike a chord of fear in most
of the population.

Curtis Smith, a University of Pitts-
burgh police officer, offers a
specialized class in self—defense for
the university. The class is offered on
Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:30
p.m. to 3:30 p.m.

During the term, students learn
many different defense and observa-
tion skills.

The defense skills taught in this
class are taken from different forms

of martial arts. If a move is decided‘

and agreed upon, that move is kept
for the class. Additional skills and
techniques are based on surveys from

various sources such as the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

. The idea of the class is to teach
basic skills. From there, additional
movements can be taught. ”Moves
are directed out of moves out of
moves.” said Smith/’Simplicity is the
name of the game.”

Students are taught, when attacked,
to ward off the attacker and flee.

’’If you stay,” Smith said/‘the time
could work against you.”

Being able to observe a potential-
ly dangerous situation is a primary
line of defense. According to Smith,
”Watch in front of you and see the
danger zones in that area.”

”The range of vision should also in-
clude the space above you,” Smith
added. ”From this general area, nar-
row it down to danger areas, such as
cars and doon/vays and then to a focal
point where you could be attacked
from. If the danger area is a person,

the focal points are the hands. This
decreases the possibility of being at-
tacked without your knowledge.

”The element of surprise is always
tough to deal with,” said Smith.

One of Smith's students, Susie
Anderton, was attacked twice last
year at Pitt. Because of this. she felt
the need to learn to protect herself.

”I try to get a feel for what goes on
around me,” said Anderton. ”|’ve
already used what he [Smith] has
taught me."

Student Beth Froelich also feels
there is a need for the class.

”Being a woman in today’s socie-
ty,” said Froelich/’you have to know
how to protect yourself.”

In today's world, Smith said that it
is important for everybody to learn
self-defense.

”Society changes and crime
changes,” said-Smith. ”Therefore you
also have to change-."

Krishnas must try
for better image

 , On Monday, a federal grand jury began a probe into the activities
7‘-‘_,fof a Hare Krishna commune in northern West Virginia. The event
'3 j that sparked the investigation was the shooting death of a dissident
f‘-3“ devotee of the Hindu sect. The gentleman charged with the shooting
1* has also been charged with the murder of another fallen Krishna. The
 jury is trying to determine if there is a conspiracy involved, or if they
I  are isolated incidents. In addition to the two homicides, allegations
475-of drug trafficking and child abuse are also being investigated.
"if , On Monday, The Pitt News ran a front page story on the sect’s re-
 cent troubles. Included was an interview with a local Hare Krishna
 follower who lamented the fact that events like these give them a
“ bad reputation, and the wrongdoers are not true followers of the
Krishna Consciousness.
The Hare Krishnas are regarded as a cult by many people. Cult is
. a difficult word to define, but most will agree that it has a bad con-
 notation and that may be the reason Krishnas are viewed with such
"I suspicion. The news of the federal investigation will not make the
 - general public more receptive to them by any means. Here lies the
 problem. The Krishnas dislike their bad public image, but they can't
seem to make any improvements.
 They do try though; they offer vegetarian meals at their house in
i  Oakland. They offer vegetarian cooking classes there too. But judg-
_  ing from the cold reception they receive on the streets, the food isn't
‘ * working. People generally don't accept the Krishnas as a legitimate
religion. Many people can't understand what could make an
, established professional man or woman trade in his or her pinstripes
 ’ for an orange robe. The entire movement is shrouded in mystery.
I ' *- That mystery may be the fault of the Krishnas or it may be mainstream
I _ America who is responsible. Whatever the case, Western society will
‘W: survive without a better understanding of the Hare Krishnas. The
' Krishnas are the ones who need to gain acceptance. Instead of hand-
ing out literature on the streets, they could spend more time explain-
ing the happiness they claim to have found. If the Krishnas would
only make their practices and beliefs more public, that could very
well solve their public image dilemma. The better people understand
an organization, the less suspicious they are of it. lfthe Krishnas ever
hope to gain the acceptance they seem to want so badly, they have
to stop hiding. Make the world aware of their achievements, and then
their scandals won't draw any more attention than anyone else’s do.

Fieldhouse woes  

In the newspaper business space means money. Last year, there
was an abundance of space devoted to the Rev. Louis Farrakhan. He
was coming to speak to the students, and his speech was to be held
in the Fitzgerald Field House. The location of Farrakhan’s address
was the least of anyone’s concerns. What troubled the student body
and the surrounding community was the controversial nature of the
man and the possibility of conflict erupting from his speech.

 

_ is:-_‘”;:j\)-/’r_T-,,-P.'15:. :_~/,“._

 

Well, Farrakhan came, gave his speech and left. The whole thing -

went off without a hitch. Whether Farrakhan’s visit benefited the stu-
dent body is not to be addressed here. What must be addressed,
‘however, is Alfrieda Goff and her committee's decision not to allow
,a benefit professional wrestling match to be held in the Field House.
lt’s not as though those requesting the Field House hadn't prepared
for their request. They were willing to provide police and volunteer
security. The event would have been insured by the Professional
Wrestling Association as well. And all of the money that would have
been raised was going to go to the Hamarville Rehabilitation Center.
The Civic Arena holds several pro wrestling matches annually, with
a minimum of incidents. If this is true, why was such a volatile speaker
as Farrakhan permitted to speak, while the Greeks are prohibited to
sponsor an event yielding determined benefits in the same facility?
Some people's priorities must be re-evaluated.

The Reagans’g guide to   it 
drugs in American life.

The first family's moving and
ludicrous plea for a ”crusade” against
drug use should have been published
in a book entitled Every Grand Ole
Grandparents Handbook of Poetic
Stereotypes, to be bound by hand in
leather, personalized, signed and
available by special order in a limited
edition by the Government Printing
Office, Washington, D.C. Such lines
as, ”Soon they will have no dark
alleys to hide in,” carefully evoke the
image of drug dealers as unkempt
young men, probably Mexican,
pushing in the alleyway behind the
neighborhood school. The reality is
that many drug users are people in
executive board rooms.

It is my opinion that Americans
have the moral right, if not the legal
one, to smoke marijuana in the
privacy of their homes. That most
Americans seem to agree suggests
that the system simply hasn't gotten
around to doing the clearly legitimate

JAMES CRARY

and decent thing — to decriminalize
the drug. I'm not even sure that can-
nabis sativa can be called a drug.

Considering marijuana to be illegal
is dangerous because it obscures the
real problem of drug abuse and
alienates many users from their
government. The voter turn-out in re-
cent national elections suggests an
estrangement from the system that ar-
chaic drug laws only augment.

Perhaps the most vicious thing
about the anachronistic perspective
we have of marijuana is that it actual-
ly increases the likelihood that drugs
will be abused.

Marijuana use doesn't lead to
harder drugs; marijuana laws do. Pic-
ture yourself as an adolescent in the
stereotype that Ma and Pa Reagan
have depicted. You're discovering

the dark side of America in an
alleyway behind school. The pusher,
a hairy, muscular specimen of the
machismo you've been taught to
emulate and admire, offers you a
joint. You refuse because you're told
it's dangerous. He taunts you. You
finally submit and discover that it
really isn't so bad. Next time it's a
harder drug, and since marijuana isn't
so bad, then you reason that speed
probably isn't either, or cocaine. The
facts donot speak for themselves, but
the laws should —- instead they don't.

The first acts in a national War on
Drugs should be the decriminaliza-
tion of marijuana and the abolition
of stereotypes which merely damage
the credibility of the crusaders. Then
maybe we can get a national dia-
logue going on just precisely where
the place for drugs in our lifestyles is,
and how we can cope with the di-
mensions of withdrawal and reinte-
gration.

Traffic court provides
an interesting experience

Trying to park in Oakland is
dangerous and costly.

The city hands out more tickets in
Oakland than the Pirates do inthe en-
tire state. One need only watch the
police between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. on
Forbes Avenue to realize that. This is
only scratching the surface however.
The ticketing extends from the lots
between Forbes Quadrangle and
Frick Fine Arts Building well into
south Oakland, where the area is
zoned as a residential parking area.
One needs a parking permit, which
the city will issue to you after you
provide a driver's license, an owner's
card, a lease and a $10 bill. If you
park there without a“ permit, you get
ticketed; the fine is $32.50.

Enter Pittsburgh's answer to the
neighborhood thrift shop — Traffic
Court. Held more than several times
weekly in the Public Safety Building
downtown, Traffic Court provides
ticketees the opportunity to take care
of parking tickets at a reduced rate.

People go in there with delusions
of getting the parking ticket taken
care of. Some have legitimate cases,
and get the ticket dismissed, but most
— more like all —— get it reduced from
$32.50 to $17.50, just for showing
up.

It is an interesting set-up. There are
two doors, the IN door and the OUT
door. One can walk out the IN door,
but don't even think about walking

   
 

    
   

.
1,!/’ ’

.iiivi RBAN

in the OUT door. I mean, you just
don't do it!

You see, the IN door has access to
the general courtroom area, but to
reach the OUT door, you must first
walk through a hallway where the
cashier — the guy to whom you pay
your fine — is located. He works in
a glass cage.

The last time I was there, it was an
evening session of traffic court. I
waited patiently for my roommate to
plead his case. He was ticketed for
parking in a fire lane and was trying
to tell the magistratethere were no
"No Parking” signs posted. That was
probably about the eighth time she
had heard that story this particular

evening, so she smiled and reduced
the fine to $17.50. That is when the
trouble started.

Unknowingly, an innocent ticketee
had wandered in the OUT door. The
man in the cage was stricken with
rage. ”Hey,” he shouted, ”get out of
this hallway right nowI”

I, of course, smitten with curiosi-
ty, wondered exactly what the heck
was going on. Slowly I turned, step
by step, until I reached the hallway.
I popped my head in to take a gander
and saw a disillusioned teenager
scared by a man stricken with rage,
who worked i n a glass cage. The man
kind of resembled Tony Curtis in his
younger days.

Tony Curtis saw my inquisitive face
and let me have it too. ”And you,”
he bellowed, pointing at me, "step
back out of that doorway.” I smiled
and obliged the kind gentleman."
When it came time for my roommate
to pay his fine, we both entered the
hallway. Tony Curtis informed my
roommate that he could stay and pay
his ticket, but ”Smilie” (that was his
pet name for me) had to get out. So
I walked out the OUT door and the
escapade was over.

A moral to the story? At Traffic
Court, you may not know whether
you are coming or going, but Tony
Curtis will be glad to let you know,
and your fine will most likely be
reduced.

It's a lsi

Pitt
takes on
Santa
Barbara

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer ~

The Lady Panther volleyball team
has its work cut out for this weekend.
In what could prove to be the
toughest stretch of Pitt's schedule, the
main feeling at Fitzgerald Field
House is one of excitement. It isn't
every day that an eastern team gets
the chance to play a California team.
Santa Barbara, ranked 7th in the na-
tion, matches up with Pitt tonight at
7 p.m.

Coach Collier believes, "This
might be the best college team to
ever play at the University of Pitts-
burgh. It's a great opportunity to see
some high calibre volleyball."

The Lady Panthers are going into
the game with a 7-1 record. Santa
Barbara is coming off an upset over
the defending national champs,‘.the
University of the Pacific.

One encouraging sign for the Lady

Panthers is the fact that they are back.

in full force. The injured Lisa Stewart
returns to play tonight. Coach Collier
also has a. healthy, somewhat ex-
perienced bench to draw from. Col-
lier notes that "the fact that we've
already beaten one California team
should provide us with a little more
confidence. We want to promote the
sport, which is why we worked to get
a team with Santa Barbara's ability to
come east. If we play well, ,I see no
reason why we shouldn't be able to
hold_our own." _

Lady Gaucho Coach Kathy
Gregory brings her team to Pitt with
a 4-0 record. In her I 1th year as head
coach at Santa Barbara, Coach

Gregory noted that this was their first ‘

trip to the east.

Burtnett

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

College football coaches like to
play mind games "during media
luncheons. They always belittle their
own team's talents and abilities,
while talking of their upcoming op-
ponent as if they are better than the
Chicago Bears. This is done in hopes
that they will catch their next oppo-
nent off guard.

Purdue football coach Leon Burt-
nett seems to be an expert at this
trade. During the course of Tuesday's
luncheon at Pitt Stadium he told the
Pittsburgh media the following:

0 "Randy Dixon is probably the
best offensive lineman in the coun-
try. When he goes up against our
freshman Bill Hitchcock [a 6-6,
260—pound defensive tackle], it will
be the mismatch of the century."

0 "Charles Gladman is a tremen-
dous back. I would put him _in the
same class as Lorenzo White
[Michigan State's Heisman Trophy
candidate]."

0 When asked about the Panthers
offense he said, "They have weapons
beyond imagination. I like Congemi

Nora Mulvihill (see story), a sophomore from Norwin, will help lead _the volleyball
' team this weekend in the the Pitt Classic. Among the visiting teams _in the tourney
will be Santa Barbara, one ‘of America's top collegiate powers.

may get a faceful of humble pie'

ter of getting him ready to play,"

a lot. He's a winner. And their
backfield is unbelievable. They are
one of the best football teams we will
face all year in terms of personnel.”

0 When asked what worried him
about Pitt's defense he commented,
"Everything: They are extremely big
and strong, and their secondary has
improved.”

0 Asked what effort Pitt would
have to put forth to beat his Boiler-
makers tomorrow, he said, "Probably
just show up, [given] the way we
played last week.”

Come on, Leon, Pitt is 0-1-1. They
have some talent, but they're not
Oklahoma now, are they?

This kind of talk is usually forgot-
ten. Panther coach Mike Gottfried
knows it is probably a psychological

ploy by Burtnett, who is hoping Pitt ,

will take his young, inexperienced
team too lightly in the regionally
televised game.

Although, in this case, Burtnett may
not have anything to hide. His Boiler-
makers aren't too good. Despite win-
ning their home opener last week
20-3 over an inferior Ball State team,
Purdue was far from impressive. The

Boilermakers outgained Ball State by,

 

ENRIGI-I'I'

only a 301-217 margin and needed
a 97-yard kickoff return by All-
America cornerback Rod Woodson
to break open a close contest.

With only seven seniors on the en-
tire squad and a freshman quarter-
back — albeit a good one in high
school — All-America Jeff George,
one can see why Burtnett downplays
his team's chances against the
Panthers.

-But Gottfried knows Pitt is in no ..

. 7*. .

position to take anyone for granted.
"Purdue is a good football team,”
said Gottfried. "Their young quarter-
back is as good a freshman as I've
ever seen walk on the field.”

Yet, he is a freshman. In last week's
victory, George threw for 225 yards
and one touchdown, but he also had
three passes picked off. Burtnett also
pointed out that he had another in-
terception wiped out because of a
penalty and two more passes that
should have beenpicked off.

The Panthers" have a much
improved defensive secondary this
season, despite the loss of free safe-
ty Teryl Austin to a sprained knee,
and they should give Purdue's young
quarterback fits. That is what worries
Burtnett. "Pitt must be licking its
chops watching him [George] play on
film with the mistakes he made
against Ball State — throwing into’
coverage," commented Purdue's
fifth-year head coach.

"George has the talent. He
established himself as the starter
about two weeks after he got on cam-
pus. He’s still not at the level he
would have to be to move the ball

against. Pitt's defense. It's just a mat-

making 

the grade

By Tracy Milavec
Staff Writer

Volleyball coach Shelton Collier is ~
not the only person at Pitt interested

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, I986 

  
  

 

 

in academics as well as volleyball.  

"One of the main reasons I came
to Pitt was because Shelton stressed
academics so much," said Nora,

Mulvihill, a sophomore starter for the ’

Lady Panthers. ‘
Mulvihill discovered volleyball ‘
when she was in seventh grade. And

with a little prodding from her _sister, V

she joined the team.

Her high school career at Nom/in 4 ,
was filled with success. She was a key 

player in many tournament teams,
she led her team to two state cham-

pionships and was named Senior _

Athlete of the Year during her final
year at Norwin.

High school graduation did not
end Mulvihi|l's blossoming volleyball
career. She was recruited nationally,
but she finally narrowed down her
choices to Pitt and Penn State. After

 
 

 

a major recruiting battle between the 7 ~ I 

two schools, Pitt finally won.

"Coach Collier did a good job

recruiting me. He emphasized tome
how important it is.to get an educa-
tion first,” stated Mulvihill. '

Mulvihill is in the nursing program,
and she admits that, "it is hard to find
time to study, but volleyball is worth
it.”

Panthers didn't live up to their expec-
tations last year. But she feels they
will do much better this season.
”Our team is a lot more together,
we work a lot harder and we are able

to communicate with each other bet-

ter," said Mulvihill.

But Collier feels that Mulvihill '
plays a huge part in the team's new,-

found determination. ”She has a real

' strong influence on the fact that the . I '

because he's an awful long way from; _ of 

there at this particular time.”

Meanwhile, Gottfried is worried

more about his team's own mental
state than he is about the Purdue
Boilermakers. "When you don't win,
as has been the case at Pitt the last

two years, it takes its toll," said Gott- ’

fried. "I think the kids are pressing a
little bit. We have to learn to relax
more." — '

Although Pitt has a losing record,
they have played well enough to be
2-0. Eliminating some of the mental
mistakes that have plagued them
could very well be all that stands be-
tween them and a victory.

If Purdue has a chance, their
defense will have to play a great
game. And even that may not be
enough. "Pitt's offensive personnel

has had to adjust to Gottfried's for-*

mations," added Burtnett. "They've
come so close to making so many big
plays. I'm worried they are going to
explode against us.”

That just about sums it up. Look for
a Panther rout tomorrow afternoon.
And for Leon Burtnett to say, ''I told
you so." . ' .

at Pitt Stadium. The Panthers had shut out both
Slippery Rock and California in their first two
games of the year.

The soccer team is back in action tomorrow

The Pitt Panthers soccer team
manhandled the St. Francis Red Flash
6-1 in Wednesday's game, improv-
ing their record to 3-0.

Both teams came out playing flat,
with the ball just bouncing around a
lot. To the sparse Pitt Stadium crowd,
it looked like neither team wanted to
be there. Finally about 10 minutes in-
to the game, Pitt found that this
wasn't a practice but a real game.
They started hitting the passes, and
they drove through the St. Francis
defense. Then with 29:35 left in the
first half Pitt seniorloe Triglia kicked
the ball from the left side of the net.
The St. Francis goalie, Mike Donnel-
ly, tried to make a diving stop, but
the ball eluded his outstretched arms,
and the Panthers led I-O.

”Our regular goalie,” said St. Fran-
cis starter Charles Chupien, ”got hurt
in the last game. So this was the first

real action that he has seen all year.”

Two minutes later the Pitt front line
completely faked the goalie out of the
play, but sophomore Erim Gude
missed an easy score. After that small
bit of action, the teams began to slow
down. Pitt dominated the rest of the
half, but whenever they got in close,
mental mistakes caused them to lose
the ball.

Then, with 10 minutes remaining,
Pitt awoke from its stupor and started
to play soccer again. A few nice
passes and they were in on the
goalie. Pitt senior Mike Grimes end-
ed up with the ball and put it past the
goalie. His second goal of the year
gave Pitt a 2-0 lead.

St. Francis finally broke through the
Panther defense and actually took a
shot on goal. It went out of bounds,
and the Red Flash ended up with a
side kick. Pitt goalie Mark Hendricks
got in the middle of the mass of
players in front of his net and brought
down the ball, ending the first half.
Pitt led 2-O.

downing St. Francis, 6-1

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

”We didn't play too well in the first
half,”'said Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher,
”so' at the half I made a few ad-
justments, hoping they would work.”

Pitt came storming out for the sec-
ond half. The ball rarely passed the
middle of the field. With 32:16 left
in the game, their work paid off —
freshman Bryan Hammond kicked
the ball into the St. Francis net to give
Pitt a 3-0 lead. The ball was then
kicked into Panthe_r territory, where
it stayed for all of 30 seconds. Soon
Gude made it 4-0, and Pitt was on its
way to a rout. Three minutes after
(Jude's goal, Pitt sophomore Sam
Lanza sent another one past the St.
Francis goalie, and it was 5-0.’At this
point coach Luxbacher began to pull
his starters off the field. ”I wanted to
give the others playing time,” he said.

But he couldn’t pull sophomore Jeff
Vargas off fast enough. Two minutes
later the ball was again sitting in the
back of the St. Francis net. Vargas

celebrated his first goal of the season -

as he ran off the field. ”We played
well,” said Vargas. ”Hopefully this
game will put us on a roll.’’

The rest of the game was ragged.
Red Flash starters went up against
Panther reserves, and neither looked
serious. Then‘ with 9:56 left in the
game, St. Francis sophomore Paul
Gobbi scared, but it was a case of too
little too late. When the buzzer
sounded to end the game, the
scoreboard read Pitt 6, St. Francis 1.

Pitt's offense really didn't play as
well as the score implies. They
missed a lot of passes and made some
obvious mistakes. The futility of the
St. Francis defense aided the Panther
cause. .

”We are starting to jell as a team
now,” commented Luxbacher. ”But
Saturday's game against Bucknell is
going to be the toughest so far. They
beat us last year [2-1]. I hope this easy
win can keep our team up.”

, Saturday's game is at Pitt Stadium
at 1:30 p.m. Everyone associated
with the team agrees that this is go-
ing to be a tough and entertaining

Men's tennis team
aces Fairmont St.

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's tennis team downed
Fairmont State 7-2 Tuesday at Trees
Hall Courts. It was the team's first
match of the season which will be
followed by the Big East Champion-
ships this weekend.

The Pitt team outplayed Fairmont
State in singles action 5-1. Neil
Meyerowich wasn't playing his usual
brand of tennis though. He lost to his
opponent 0-6 in the first set, rallying
in the second set to make the score
closer, 4-6.

Paul Maben played No. 2 singles
for the Panthers in his first collegiate
match. Maben made a strong show-
ing, overpowering his opponent to an
easy 6-0, 6-2 win.

’’I hope this win is just the first in
a successful season. If I hit like 1 did
today, I should have no problem,”
commented Maben.

Playing No. 3, singles for the team,
Greg Campbell was victorious over
the Fairm.ont State player, 6-1, 6-0.

”l felt good out there. My ground
strokes are at their all time peak. lf
everybody plays like they have been
this past week, we should be in con-
tention for the Big East Champion-
ship.”

petitive league, Coach Gregory
pointed out, ”We’re very excited to
be here. We have a lot of respect for
eastern teams. The California tempo
is a little quicker than that of the
eastern teams, but we don't expect
to dominate. Pitt's playing calibre is
equal to ours. The national rank we
have is only on paper. We still have
to prove we can play well. Our team
is very small, but we're scrappy. I'd
say that our lack of size, if anything,
will hurt our game. Also, we have to
play five matches in four days. Life
on the road could affect our game
greatly. We might have to contend

with referees who have differing

styles and the traveling itself.” (San-
ta Barbara played at Penn State last
night.)

Exactly what does Pitt have to con-
tend with? Santa Barbara comes out

of the 10-team Pacific Coast Con- l

ference. Seven of these 10 teams are
ranked in the nation, four in the top
10. Senior Charlotte Mitchell, an out-
side hitter, is the Lady Gaucho’s best
defensive player. Coach Gregory
believes her setter, Liz Town, and
right hitter, Sherri Rogers, are players
to keep an eye on.

After scrimmaging some male
volleyball players last Sunday, the
Lady Panthers feel that they are
prepared to face Santa Barbara. Out-

' side hitter Denise Frawley stated, ’’I

think we can beat them. We're ex-
cited at the prospect of playing and
beating another California team.”

Coach Collier thinks, ”The win
over California-Irvine will provide
added confidence in our game.”

The Lady Panthers host the Pitt
Classic Saturday and Sunday at Fitz-
gerald Field House. Admission is
free. The opening game will be
played at 10 a.m. when Pitt takes on
Villanova. Santa Barbara plays
Georgetown at noon. Georgetown
and Villanova will have it out at 4
p.m., and Pitt and Santa Barbara
round out the night at 7 p.m. Sunday,
Santa Barbara plays Villanova at
noon. Pitt and Georgetown do bat-
tle at 2 p.m.

team is playing up to their abilities
this year,” stated Collier.

Mulvihill feels that her biggest goal
is to help the team win the Big East
Championship. ’’If we win, we win.
If we don't, we don't. Butwe will still
feel good about ourselves because
we know we did our best.”

In the 4th singles slot, Rich
Monteleone played an aggressive
match, winning easily over his op-
ponet, 6-2, 6-2.

David Johnson, an experienced
player, won the first set of the No. 5
singles match an easy 6-1. In the sec-
ond set though, he had to play a lit-
tle harder, the score being 7-6 (7-1).

”This was a good match for
everyone. It helped sharpen our
skills. We hope to keep improving,”
added Johnson. ,

Jeff Dadowski rounded off singles
play in the No. 6 singles spot, win-
ning in two straight sets; 6-4, 6-3.

”This was a good first match; we're
trying to gain our confidence back,”
said Dadowski. ”We feel prepared
for the Big East Tournament.”

Pitt won two of the three doubles
matches played. Pitt's No. 1 doubles
team, Meyerwich and Maben, won
over Fairmont State, 6-2,. 6-3. The No.

‘2 doubles team, Johnson and

Dadowski, lost their match 6-1, 6-4.
Campbell and Monteleone, the No.
3 doubles team, played strongly,

_ defeating their competition, 6-2, 6-4..

The Pitt men's tennis team looks
strong. They will be a threat to win
at the Big East Championships this
weekend, as well as during the re-
maining season.

Dave Johnson and the rest of the Pitt men's tennis
team won a tune-up match Wednesday over Fair-
mont St. in preparation for the Big East Champion-
ships this weekend.

The Lady Panthers tennis team
recently challenged St. Vincent's Col-
lege. The Pitt women walked away
from this match victorious, shutting
out their opponents 9-0. This is a
great confidence builder for the Pitt
squad, which was shut out by Penn
State on Sunday. ‘

Jodi Levine played No. 1 singles for
the Panthers, beating her opponent
6-0, 6-3. At the No. 2 position, Tracy
Feltingoff shut out her opponent 6-0,
6-0. Stephanie Nelson played strong-

i By David Zuchowski

The musicians who insist upon
playing music of the Renaissance
and the baroque period on in-
struments authentic to the era
A are a surprising lot; they play
very old music, but they
themselves are young. lt’s a
burgeoning trend, one that has
grown rapidly in the past
~decade: the desire to hear
Bach, Handel, John Dowland
—_ and Praetorius on wooden
flutes, recorders, lutes and viols,
as those composers themselves

_ heard the music.
'  "if there are few grey-haired

grandfathers of the early music
movement, it is because the
movement itself is young, and
many of its most accomplished
practitioners are in their 20s and
305.

In Pittsburgh, early music may
be heard at the concerts of the
Renaissance and Baroque
Society, whose season opens
on Sept. 27 at 8 p.m. at Synod
Hall (T25 N. Craig St. in
Oakland).

Leading off the season is the

Baltimore Consort, a band of I

Renaissance musicians who play
both popular and art music of
the lath and l7th centuries.

Some of the tunes in this concert,
for example "Over the Hills and
Far Away," will be familiar to
today's audience as those same
melodies played by old-time
bands and country fiddlers. To
balance the program, the
ensemble will play more formal
music of the courtly life as well.

The five instrumentalists, ad-
ding the colorful bandora and
cittern to the more familiar lute

and recorder, will be ioined by

soprano Custer LaRue, whose
voice is especially suited to the
program's English and Scottish
ballads.

The audience will be invited to
share some authentic Renais-
sance treats, shortbread and
almond—cardamon cakes, at a
reception following the concert.

The Renaissance and Baroque
Society has eight concerts dur-
ing its l98o’-87 season.
Highlighting the season is
lvlusica Antiqua Koln, the superb
baroque ensemble from Ger-
many. Other concerts feature
Anner Bylsma playing cello
suites, Ensemble PAN playing

courtly |_ove songs on Valentine's "

Day and the Society's ensem-
ble—in—residence, lVlusic’s Re-

At its season finale, the Socie-

Three chords that might
make Milwaukee famous

 

BoDeans hail from the
land at barley and
hops. Their sound is
simple, like the Everly's
or Buddy Holly's. But
as Beau BoDean says,
"Even Prince writes
three-chord songs."

 

By John Mccombe
Item No. I

BoDeans p/ay i‘hree—chora’
songs.

I know because Beau BoDean
told me so. Only three chords.
It a band uses any less, they are
veering dangerously close to the
Gregorian chant. Sure, a lot can
be done with only three chords,-
who could torget "Louie,
Louie,” "lvlony, lvlony" or
Duran Duran. No, scratch that
last one. Essentially, the three
chord progression is the primary
ingredient in the recipe for rock
'n' roll. Listen to their album love
and Hope and Sex and Dreams

‘and hear how BoDeans have

cooked up a steamy stew ot
farm-fresh rifts. They sound like
you've heard them before, but
they still sound great.

Item No. 2

BoDeans have a coo/ name.

Sammy BoDean and Beau Bo-
Dean sing and play guitar. Bob
BoDean plays bass and Guy Bo-
Dean plays drums. This was not
a coincidence. It wasn't a case
of tour guys who just happened
to be named BoDean who one
day set up their amps in Dad's
garage. This is a band. BoDeans
took on a common surname tor
a reason. In Beau's words,

"We're not tour guys ott in our
own worlds. We try to work
together on stage." Personally,
I like the idea at a rock 'n' roll
tamily. The Ramones and The
Partridges are two pillars of 20th
century popular culture. Besides,
”Bodine” was Jethro's last
name on The Bever/y H/'//b///ies.
Like I said, it's a cool name.

The band's label is
Slash/Warner Bros., home Oi
The Blasters, Los Lobos and
tellow lvlilwaukeeans, the
Violent Femmes. Beau describes
the reason for the "Slashing" ot
BoDeans: "We were courted
by three [maior labels]. Slash
was always a label that was
picking rock 'n' roll bands up off
the street and letting them do
their stuff. We had other otters
trom labels like Capitol but I think
we were a little safer on Slash.”

Even though we are oh‘ the
subiect Oi cool names, Love and
Hope and Sex and Dreams was
produced by a guy named T-
Bone. T-Bone Burnett also pro-
duced the most recent records
by Marshall Crenshaw and Elvis
Costello. As Beau said, "He's a
nice guy. He's very human and
very against the record business
things that can suck you up it
you're not careful." T-Bone is
also a quirky and brilliant
songwriter and one of the most

ies in town!

David Byrnetangos

By Douglas Payne

For those attending tonight
and tomorrow night's showing
of Home oft/7e Brave (as well as
next Friday and Saturday), the
Pittsburgh Filmmakers will also
present the Talking Heads film
Stop Making Sense. A separate
admission fee will be charged.
for each film. This is a unique op-
portunity to witness the visual
performance artistry of the Talk-
ing Heads and Laurie Anderson,
as well as to mark the entertain-
ment goals each try to achieve
in their performances.

Ironically, Stop Making Sense
served as the predecessor to
Home of the Brave much in the
same way that Laurie Ander-
son's magnum opus United
States is very similar in nature to
the new Talking/Heads film, True

-: :3r‘!e.

Stories.

Stop Making Sense, filmed on
their i983 Speaking in Tongues
tour and released in l984, was
directed by Jonathon Demme,
whose biggest claim to fame up
until then was "directing” the
trashy classic Caged Heat. His
minimalist approach to filming
the Heads in‘ concert is as effec-
tive as it is invigorating, and the
film remains remarkable in that it
is the first unpretentious concert
film; and, yes, that includes all
those needless Rolling Stones
epics.

Demme captures a gyrating,
manic David Byrne and band as
they go through a metamorphic
processional. From a solo Byrne,
who later inhabits the core of a
nine—piece group, to the perfor-
mance artistry which colors even
their most commercial music,

center stage in Stop Making Sense.

Demme gives us a testimony to
diversity. The pyrofolk of
”Psycho Killer" yields to the
new wave spiritual in ”Slippery
People,” which eventually leads
to Byrne's tango with the floor
lamp in ”This Must Be The
Place.” However, to the
uninitiated, it is not as bizarre as
it seems. The Talking Heads is an
aggregate of very individually
minded yet thoughtfully yielding
inusicians who put on a bare
bones rock show which can be
all but basic. Energy like this is
not to be found in a heavy metal
band.

Having seen the Talking
Heads in concert only a few
weeks before the filming of Stop
Making’ Sense, the movie does
not live "up to its concert hall ex-
pectations, but it's the closest

‘any concert film had come up to

  

that point. Maybe This is Spina/
Tap really taught directors a
lesson. Demme has left out the
flashy camera gimmicks and
pointless interviews in favor of a
front—row, audience—oriented
view of the band. The high point
in the film is the kinetic anthem
to male menopause, "Once In
A Lifetime,” where Demme’s
camera simply assumes the posi-
tion of a well-seated audience
member. That's it; even
backstage shots are kept to a
_minimum_. Now maybe Demme
can live up to his vastly over-
rated reputation, for his direction
‘captured the Heads in a perfect
ig t.
Stop Making Sense is playing

Reiner's dormant memories

By Ike Shibley

Stand By Me, which has been
a pleasant suprise for
Hollywood this year, proves a
few things about the movie in-
dustry. One is that Rob Reiner is
a topnotch director and seems to
have gained an understanding
of film making early in his direc-
torial career. Secondly, the film
showcases four young stars who
give heartwarming perfor-
mances and assert that there will
not be a shortage of fine young
actors in the near future. Lastly,
Stand By (Me attests to the fact
that Stephen King can indeed
write books which are capable

of first—rate, entertaining adapta- '

tions to the big screen.

The film, in its purest sense, is_

an exploration of youth. Four
friends embark on a two—day
journey to see a dead body
which is supposedly located 20
miles outside of town. Along the
way the foursome enioys some
exciting escapades, a lot of
good talk and true friendship.
Richard Dreyfuss, who stars as
one of the boys who has grown
up to be a successful writer,
relates the story as he reminisces
about the past. Through his
eyes, the audience is able to
share the experiences of the four
boys.

Wil Wheaton and River
Phoenix, who portray Gordie
and Chris respectively, are the

central characters of the story ,

and are the ”best of friends,” as
Gordie writes in his book. They
lead the cost through their
adventure, and both turn in
wonderful performances — the
best in the film. Corey Feldman
plays Teddy, a guy with only
one ear because his dad, who
is a little ”looney,” put Teddy's

ear to the stove during a fit of A

rage. Jerry O'Connell portrays_

Vern, the fat, whiny kid who
seems to have been present in
everyone's childhood. Both
Feldman and O'Connell give the
movie its comic moments and
both play their roles with an
openness often lost once
adolescence passes. The leader
of the bad guys in the story is
played menacingly by Kiefer
Sutherland, who bears a striking
resemblance to his father
Donald. His role is minor, but he
fits well into the bully mold that

' King had originally designed.

The soundtrack is filled with
songs from the fabulous '50s,
and they blend exceptionally
well with the happenings on the
screen. Throughout the rest of
the film, Jack Nitzsche provides
music that is well suited for the
atmosphere of the picture.

The one problem with the film
is that the I I-year-old
characters seem to have too
much insight into the world. The
same was also true of The Body,
the novella from which the

works is because Rob Reiner is
at the helm. He has taken a
group of fledgling actors and
molded them to fit a solid script.
What Reiner did so well with
college students in The Sure
Thing, he has done as well with
sixth graders in Stand By Me. He
has a feel for movies that is not
often seen in this day of cinema.
Reiner has made a movie that

will touch the heart and is bound 4

to stir up some childhood
memories that may have long
been dormant

 

The four central participants in
the film are linked by some invisi-
ble bond that seems only to be
felt in the friendships of youth. As
adults, the connection becomes
threadbare and easily broken.
The movie is best understood by
reading the words on Richard
Dreyfuss' word processor at the
end of_the film. He completes his
story with the phrase, ’’I never
had friends like I had when l was
I I. Jesus, does anyone?"

On a scale of one to IO, this
movie rates on eight.

Wynton Marsalis

As in most musical facets, even
jazz needs its superstar. That
status in most fields is not always
deserved, but in a field where
financial success is virtually
nonexistent, it is usually either

hyped or earned. Wynton Mar-A

J Mood, Wynton's latest
endeavor, seeks to add another
chapter to the trumpeter’s ubi-
quitous career. The album marks
a left turn in Wynton's musician-
ship, after his firing the core of
his rhythm section, including
brother Bradford, because of
their devotion to Sting. Mr. Mar-

debut Wynton Marsa/is. The
playing, as always, is proficient,
albeit studied, but an astonishing
lack of passion exists as well. On
the title piece, Wynton's
restraint could pass as laziness
in the hands of an equally
talented horn player, despite the
ethereal beauty of the song.
However, pianist» Marcus
Roberts displays a dexterity of
right- and left—hand coordination
here which puts the soul back in-
to the basic blues of the song's
structure. ”After," written by
Wynton's pianist father Ellis, is
another marvelous showcase for
the talented Roberts, as well as
being a nice slow blues. Roberts
shows his affinity for the Bill
Evans sensitivity, but his style
needs just a little more personali-
ty to provide competition for
Mulgrew Miller or Kenny
Kirkland. Undeniably, though,
his playing is a nice embellish-
ment to the proceedings.
However, Wynton's playing

on J Mood lacks a definitive
direction even though his tone is
warm and relaxed, and his ap-
proach is sparse. Unfortunately,

I the listener has to wait until the

last song on side two, ”Much
Later," to hear what he's truly
capable of. Marsalis employs a
thoroughly inspired delivery with
enough tonality and tenancity to
live up to those wild rumors that
this guy is some kind of boy
wonder. In other tunes,
however, Wynton seems to be
shamelessly copying styles. ”ln—
sane” sounds very much like
Freddie Hubbard with the Jazz
Messengers, and ”Melodique"
sounds like it was lifted right from
the Miles Davis E.S.P. session;
Jeff Watts even does a perfect
Tony Williams imitation here.
Although Marsalis plays well on
each tune, it's ‘Marcus Roberts’
pianistry that steals the show

most of the time. Also, Marsalis

has a very esoteric streak in his
approach to writing. That's

good, of course, but unlike
Ornette Coleman or Don
Cherry, he seems to be com-
municating very little. Perhaps
that's a harsh assessment, yet
there is an uninspired sort of
pastiche to his work.

Another problem is the loss of
Branford Marsalis. He adds an
unbridled sense of fun and feel-
ing to Wynton's very straight-
faced charts. It's like hearing a

, weather report without Wayne

Shorter; something’s missing.
The absence of the reed player
hurts the outcome of the blues
they've attempted to’ achieve
here. It's not at all bad, it's just
not great. To me, Wynton's
playing has never yet equalled
the love he gave to ”Sister
Cheryl" on Wynton Marsalis, or
any of his vastly underrated per-
formances onlhis collection of
standards, Hot House F/owers.

BABY, THESTARS SHINE
BRIGHT

Eyerything but the Girl
Sire Records

By John Mccombe

In the words of the late, great
Jukebox Juror, to listen to
Everything but the Girl is to
”Iaze back in laziest lazy boy in
town.” In layman's terms,
Tracey Thorn’s delivery is real,
real cool. In fact, at times, her
breathy alto sounds icy cold.

lvlatch” on that band's /\/iy Ever
Changing Moods LP. The stage
was set for Tracey to become
the British Billie Holiday of the
'80s. The pulse of the upright
bass was coaxed by the steady,
gentle slap of the ride cymbal.
But when Tracey made her
grand entrance, she could only
draw yawns from discriminating
ears. ’

Thorn has —warmed con-
siderably on Baby, the Stars
Shine Bright, but her material is
only occasionally interesting.
The album is a linear progression
from the less jazzy Love Not
/Vloney, with the dominant in-
fluence being the sort of uptown,
'60s-pop balladry perpetrated
by Petula Clark.

Included here are a few stabs
at the classic C&W tear-ierker
with ”Come Hell or High
Water" and "Country Mile."
The particularly tame, anti-
fascist diatribe ”LittIe HitIers"
also stands out only because it
breaks the album's string of
starry-eyed love songs.

The major problem that I have
with Baby, the Stars Shine Bright

is that Thorn and her principle.

tunesmith Ben Watt have
fashioned a song cycle with a
lack of diverse musical flavor.
Sure, this record's overt roman-
ticism is the perfect backdrop for
a candlelitseduction but too
many tracks become in-
distinguishable in any other light.
The Juror would call this ”The
Lazy Boy Syndrome.” I would
call it a minor disappointment
from some cool cats who are
capable of much more.

the drums pounding sharply —
they fuse suddenly to introduce
an entirely new melody in
unison. Yet with the strong play-
ing and keen melodic sense
displayed on the album, all
these devices work.

Steve Anderson's singing
causes some problems, how-
ever. Anderson's phrasing is
reminiscent of David Byrne's,
and like Byrne, ‘ Anderson's
vocals are often somewhere
between talking and singing. But
while David Byrne can and does
sing the notes of a melody when
called on to do so, Anderson
struggles with any actual sing-
ing. Sometimes the device is ap-
propriate, but more often it
sounds careless and, well,
slovenly.

But Anderson and bandmate
Tim Plowman have a real knack
for creating lasting images in the
lyrics Anderson sings. ”Sand”

7? . By Ike Shibley

The last time I can remember

f__ , seeing so few people at a ma-

 v. hosted the Cubs at Three Rivers
‘ 7 Stadium. There was a grand

total of 800 people at the Quiet

question that kept coming to

 

mind as I sat amongst this tiny
concert crowd was this: How
can a band that sold 4 million
copies of their debut album in
l983 attract a mere 800 fans to
one of their concerts in a major
market area such as Pittsburgh?

One of Quiet Riot’s major
problems is their stage show.

than an hour and then played a

crowd. He shouted and
screamed for audience response
when there just wasn't any. He
tried tomake a statement at one
point about Parents’ lvlusic
Resource Center and the
possibility that lyrics will have to
be printed on album covers. This
was hard to take seriously com-
ing from the man who had been
telling jokes to impress l6—year-
old girls.

Quiet Riot is a band with some
talented musicians and some
strong material in their repetoire.
They are just not a headliner act
and would fit much better into
the role of an opening act. Then

    September l9, 

Quiet Riot performs before 800 more or less ador-
ing fans at the Civic Arena. V

Kevin DuBrow would not get to
shoot off his overactive mouth,
and Carlos Cavazo would not
be permitted to play l0-minute
guitar solos, which he did and
which were rather boring. This
quintet’s condition right now is
critical and, judging from the
concertturnout, it soon may be
terminal.

(and sung) stories benefit great-
ly from the subtle, simple in-
strumentation on most of their
songs. Strong melodies carry the
music through and bring the
album's generally fine lyrics to
the forefront.

"Welcome To The Boom-
town" and ”Heroes” frame the
record, with ”Boomtown"
detailing the end to the high life
that drug addiction affords. ln
”Heroes" the singer is back on
top, but realizes it can't last.

Noteworthy, too, are ”Swal—
lowed By The Cracks” with its
story of vanishing youthful
dreams, and ”A Rock For The
Forgotten," a bartender's tale of
his seedy customers and how he
pours their smi/es.

Boomtown sometimes gets
weighted down by its cease-
lessly bleak vision, and occa-
sionally the songs seem too
long. But the album does
showcase some well—developed
lyrical skill, fine singing ‘and
music that intrigues instead of
whacking the listener over the
head. The trip to this city proves
one worth making.

Not everyone can offer a bargain.
First you need a good product — and
then you need a very sharp buyer.

With 27 years experience, Opus
one works very hard to bring genuine

slick studio—enhanced reproduc-

-tion of ”Venus.” Even though

these chicklets lean toward the
slightly talentless side, which
leaves them leaning on the
quality of the available material,
I'm still cool to their scene.

They are great looking, dance

A bit foster, a bit angrier and

The Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at’
Magee-Womens Hospital

is developing a sperm bank for use in
Artifical Insemination by donor semen
(AID). Because of the 30 percent
incidence rate of male factor in our
infertile population, there is a need for
donor sperm. We are presently
recruiting men, 21 years of age or
older, who might be interested in
participating as donors in this Program. I
Monetary renumeration will be
provided for the screening evaluation
as well as for each frozen specimen.

If you would like to be considered as
a donor, please Contact Mary Anne
Schulz, C.R.N.P. in the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology at Magee—
Womens Hospital by phoning 647-4220.
Be assured that complete conﬁdentiality
will be maintained.

 
 

   

ened to the scat singing of jazz
performers, but with a Persian
sound. Using the meaningless
phrases of the syllabic content
was necessary for two reasons.
First, some of the folk songs were
originally sung in one of the
minority languages which Vali
himself could not understand. But
more importantl , as in the case
of songs four, ive and seven,
they were actually made up and
fabricated to resemble authen-
tic songs that actually exist;
rather than make up words to
the songs, Vali chose to use
Persian-sounding syllables
instead.

The whole composition has a
playing time of close to I5
minutes. The shortest songs last
a mere 50 seconds; the longest
takes six minutes to perform. Vali
has yet to hear this piece which
is written for a l 7- piece or-
chestra and soprano. Having
previously written somewhere
between 40 and 50 composi-
tions, he finds that he is often sur-
prised the first time he hears one
of his works performed. "Some—
times they sound iust like I had .
imagined. But more often it's like

reading a book and then going
to see the film later. The book
and the composition often differ
drastically from the concretized

periences. Writing music is often
a surprise because you don't

continued from page 5
in Spin magazine, "Sometimes
you can put together four or five
talented musicians and get a
really terrible band. And then
sometimes you can put together
four or five sort of mediocre
musicians and get a great
band." This is definitely the case
with BoDeans. Listening to their
songs is like having pizza and
beer with your best friend: It
feels comfortable. Sammy's
voice is a raspy yet relaxed
drive down Highway ol ' with

Dylan. Only it's less nasal and
more melodic. In contrast, Beau

guitars reverberate and ring out
to ears that may or may not
have found comfort in the sacred

vriffs of The Stones or CCR.

BoDeans feel comfortable
wearing the clothes of their rock
'n' rollforefathers. They deal
with the well worn themes of
love and sex and hope and
dreams. The BoDeans sound-
track is built on three chords and
the band is a lot of fun. Who
could possiblyfask for more?

BoDeans will appear Mon-
day, Sept. 22 at Graffiti.
