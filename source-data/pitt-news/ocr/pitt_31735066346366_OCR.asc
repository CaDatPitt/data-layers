Medical Attention
Cited as ‘Inadequate’

Editor’s Note: In an attempt to clarify the
adjoining letter submitted to the Pitt News, a
number of resident students were interviewed.
In a recent poll, students were asked their opin-
ions. on the quest-ion-of the adequacy of‘ the
medical attention given by the Student Health

Service.

The general‘ attitude was one of dissatisfac-
tion, but there were a few whoifelt that it has
improved over‘ last year or ‘that the quality of

service has always been good.

Demonstration

A student demonstration spon-
sored by the temporary Student
Committee Against Totalitarianism
is being planned for tonight to
protest against the meeting of the

John Birch Society at the Carnegie .

Institute Lecture Hall.

Robert Welsh, founder of the
Society, is scheduled to be the
main speaker at the closed meet-
ing which will begin at 8:30 p.m.

Petitions are being circulated‘

among all students in the Pitts-

burgh area, but mostly at the Uni-

versity, in order to secure support
for this demonstration.

The purpose of the demon- K
stration, according to Jeffrey L. A

Hirsch, one of the organizers of
the Student Committee, is to
“protest, not against their right
to speak or assemble, but against
the basic ideology of the Soci-r
ety." ._
“All students," continued Hirsch,
“who seek to uphold the demo-
cratic tradition of this nation can
do so by coming out with a sign
denouncing the John Birch So-
ciety as the un-democratic institu-
tion that it is.”
Students who wish to partici-
pate in the protest should assem-

ble in front of the Lecture Hall’ at -

7:30 p.m.

It is not necessary, according
to Hirsch, to carrya banner in
the demonstration, for the pres-
ence of students will carry the
same effect.

Safety Director Louis Rosenberg
has assured the Committee that
they will not be disturbed if they
keep marching, Hirsch said.

Station KDKA may send a mo-
bile unit to cover the protest.

Changes  

Two University administrators have assumed new posi-

tions as a result of a newliy-formed educational expansion

program, it was announced yesterday. g
V Dr. John Geise, former assistant chancellor of Student
Affairs, has been appointed vice-chancellor for Regional~Pro-

intensiﬁed

He is succeeded inhis former
post by Dr. Alan Rankin, past
assistant chancellor for ‘General
Affairs. Dr. Rankin also retains

his old duties; he is now in charge‘

of the combined office of Student
and General Affairs.

Announcement of the adminis-
trative change was made follow-
ing the University’s Board of
Trustees’ meeting yesterday.

The new program, acording
to Chancellor Litchﬁcld, “is an
expression of our concern for

the total educational picture in
this region beyond the high
school level.”

Dr. Geise came to the Univer-
sity in 1925-as a Wallace Research
Fellow in history. He has held
positions ranging from instructor
in historyto dean of the College,
his former title before he was ap-
pointed assistant chancellor in
1958.

The author of two historical‘
texts, Dr. Geise is also regional
director of the National Defense
Education , Board.

Dr. Rankin has been with the
University since 1956 when he
was an executive assistant to the
chancellor and an associate pro-
fessor of political science. In 1958

he was appointed assistant chan-

cellor for General Affairs.

By BARRY GROSS

Gabriel Makoso, editor of a
Congo newspaper, met with
reporters from the Pittsburgh
area Monday, at a conference
sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Council for International Vis-

itors. ‘
Makoso, a slim Nigerian of me-

dium height, spoke only French,
, and used an interpreter. Questions
’ from the ‘three reporters present

came slowly in the Council’s Amos

'.‘Hal1 lounge, as Makoso’s answers
in French were translated into

English. ‘

.The first queries concerned the
late Dag Hammarskjold. Makoso

‘felt that the Secretary General had

enjoyed a very good reputation in

Leopoldville. The Post-Gazette re-
porter asked if I-lammarskjold’s ’

death would delay uniﬁcation of

. the Congo.

“The uniﬁcation of the Congo
is. not necessarily bound up in one
man;” Makoso answered.

Views Carry "Far
When asked how and when he

5 thought uniﬁcation would come to

the Congo, Makoso said, “I leave
this question ‘to the politicians.”
Many of his answers were eva-
sive, but this may be because of
his outspoken criticism of La-
mumba, which sent him to jail
last year. .

As’Chief editor and publisher
of Le Courier d’Afrique, a Leo-
poldville newspaper that is one
of the Congo’s three dailies, his
views carry all over Africa and
beyond, reaching from 15,000 to
18,000 readers.

The paper was founded 30 years
ago by a Belgian corporation. It
changed hands. in 1959, prior to
Congolese independence, and since
‘then has been owned and operated
by the Congolese.

‘Everything’ Urgent

Makoso declined to say how his
friends in the Congo saw the So-
viet Union’s and the United States’
positions in Africa, saying instead
that “it is our wish to look after
our own affairs. Would the Congo
p r e f e r UN withdrawal? “The
preseence of the UN, I feel, is still
necessary.”

Makoso also declined to say
how much sympathy there was
in the Congo toward the regime
of Lumumba. He feels that
there is no speciﬁc area, such as
economics or education, that the
people of Africa. should pay
most attention to, but that
everything is most urgent.

He was asked how the UN can
best help the Congo. “The UN 18

’ from Nigeria would not say who

he thought was the most powerful
man in the Congo and would not
assess the reality of a pan-African

Then the conversation shifted to
newspapers. Describing freedom

reminded the reporters that free-
dom .of the press is relative. He
did say that the law in the Congo

but it is a matter of interpreta-

“Papers which were once
closed in the Congo are now

SG Doubts
‘Pitt News’

Senator Sa-ys
pPape'r Causes
False Ideas

By JIM NELSON
The Student Senate charged
the Pitt News in the Senate
business meeting M o n d a y
with lack of cooperation with
SG in holding news which SG

considered not ready for pub-
lication.

Sen. Bill Hale, who began a
discussion of Pitt News editorial
policy, commented that it has been
the past and current experience
of SG to have news released be-
fore SG has given its permission.

He cited that in some cases pub-
licity of SG work could cause mis-
understanding and false impres-
sions.

Hale quoted Pitt News Editor,
Julie Thomas as saying that the
paper would print any news it
wanted to print, with or without
the approval of SG.

Sen. Linda Lee defended the
right bf the Pitt News to report
and comment on the news. At the
end of the ‘discussion, it was de-
cided that Miss Thomas would be
given the chance to present her
views at the next meeting, since

’ she‘ was not present on Monday.

The honor system was also dis-

cussed at the meeting. Irene Mc-

Cabe presented the results of a
poll of universities and colleges
concerning an honor code.

Sen. McCabe pointed out that
it has had best results in small
girls’ colleges and that there are
very few universities using it
effectively.

Bernard Adams, commenting on

the recent Student Government,

and lnterfraternity Council discus-
sion on the possibility "of remov-
ing rules that prevent the use of
alcohol on campus, said that he is
in favor of “reasonable student
action.” “If I were IF,” he said, “I
would proceed.” ‘
Ronald Pease, advisor to frate’r—
nities, said “Speaking as advisor
to IFC, I feel that IFC is moving
in the right direction.” He em-

phasized that students must use‘

an adult manner in approaching
the rules about alcohol.

In an informal atmosphere before over 200 students

:Monday night, Chancellor Litchﬁeld subtly indicated

that his days left at this University’s campus are compara-

, tively few. - _
. A Buried in all the hopeful plans for the future, one ex-
plained statement remains in the student’s mind which
“throws some weight to this year’s rumors concerning the

Chancellor’s departure. In speaking of the new Student
Union building, the Chancellor commented that “there Wlll

{be a new one within the next four years before you and I.
mgr,ad-uate.” A rather strange statement to come from the

Chancellor of a university. In what sense can he graduate?
Where does he go from here?
Perhaps it is too easy to read into innocent statements,

‘ but since his appointment here ﬁve. years ago,‘ Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld’s term of office. has been predicted by students and fac-

ulty in their turn with little actual data to support their

claims. One major argument prevailed in the forecasters’
“magic globes. The University had a reconstruction job to

do and it could not stop there.

_Drastic revisions in its educative life. were needed to
bring it back into, the elite academic circles of Harvard,
Yaleand Princeton. A dynamic leader was needed to per-

, form that.duty-—a man of the caliber and quality of Chan- .

cellor Litchﬁeld—a man with motivation.
I While -the University has by no means reached its goal

*'in the academic area, the improvement" program is well un-

derway. Even public opinion has shifted to a more favora-
ble ‘position. The hardest portion of the‘ reconstruction

J ‘period has passed. Now, once the Chancellor’s proposed .

building. expansion is at least started, many believe that his
job on this campus will be ended. J
In the light of the Chancellor’s aforementioned state-

R.” ment this belief may be so. But looking at -the advances
made in the University so far, the effects of Chancellor
:lLitchﬁeld will be farreaching whatever his final decision.

The:Absen’r Man   U .

" to go to college, not whether it

 

By Ina Amdur

While riding on the streetcar, one sees many
advertisements warning parents that in twenty
years colleges will be very crowded. “When
Johnny is ready for college will college be ready
for him?” is almost as popular a question these
days as “Have you been smok-
ing more and more and enjoying
it less and less?”

The question always seems to
be whether Johnny will be able

s

will make any difference if he
doesn’t go.’ In a recent issue of
Harper’s ‘there was a’ supplement
on the “College Scene.” Of all
the - articles discussing various
aspects of today’s colleges’, the
article which was "most impres-
sive was entitled “God in the Colleges” written by
Michael Novak, a Teaching Fellowiin Philosophy at
Harvard.-‘ The problem as Novak‘ sees it is: not the
absence of God in our colleges; it is the absence of
man. He claims quite validly that it is possible
for “a student to. go to class after class of sociology,
economics, psychology, literature, philosophy, and
the rest and hardly become aware that he is deal-
ing with issues of life anddeath, of love, and soli-
tude, of inner growth and pain.”

For most students in most colleges going to,

class is a matter ofﬁlling forty notebooks in_four
years, and of going out completely unchanged as

‘human beings, no more sensitive to the problems

of the human condition than they were when they
entered, forty notebooks lighter and four years

' earlier. Novak suggests that the only solution to
the problem would be professors who could lead.

the -student “to the profound human experiences
lying below the. surface of the academic cur-
riculum.” '

Notebook Scribblers.

These experiences have nothing at all to do with
scribbling in notebooks. They concern the basic
fund of human experiences which are unchanging
and which have to do with man’s quest to find out
who ‘he is. In a sense every person who is ‘studied,
memorized, underlined, and analyzed had an an-

 

swer to that question “Who am I?” But the stu--,
dents and many times the professors not only don’t
ask thevquestion but don’t even see clearly enough
to discern that somebody else is asking it. The
problem is to get through the exam, to add one
more notebook to the growing pile/and to s_a

proudly, “Yes, I had Nietzsche in Philosophy 27',”
One never says that one entered Nietzsche’s world,‘
and sensed the terror that he felt and the loneliness
that he suffered. One had Nietzsche like one had
a chocolate milkshake for lunch. Their eﬁects on

the behavior of the person who had them is about 

equal.

‘Absent, Man

Man is absent from many universities. He, is
absent because the students do not care to become

men (one does not automatically become a man A

at twenty-one and because the professors rarely
penetrate the academic material to the point where
the people studied become men. Learning is at
meeting of minds and ‘cannot be accomplished in

any other way. When professors do not try to en,- I

able students to grow mentally and spiritually in
college, when ultimate questions are never asked,
then one might conclude that it would be’ to
Johnny's beneﬁt if he did not go to college. Per-

haps he would learn more on his own. Forty no_te- ,

books are not difficult to fill and it is a much
cheaper process when one does not have to pay
eighty-four dollars a notebook. '

Something vital has left modern university edu-
cation. One could call it the sense of life, the idea
of personal commitment and destiny, or as Novak
does, one could call it the absence of the funda-

mental questions about the “meaning and limits of _

personal experience.”

He concludes his article by paraphrasing Nietz-
sche, “Most of Western humanism is dead too. Men
do not ‘wander under the silent stars, listen to the
wind, learn to know themselves, question, ‘Where
am Lgoing?’ ‘Why am I he're’?”‘ They leave aside
themysteries of contingency and transitoriness for
the certainties of ‘research, production, and con-
sumption. So that it is really possible to say: “Man
is dead .. . . What are these buildings, these tunnels,

these I‘08dS. if they are not the tombs and sepul-
chres of man?”

Nesvisky of Stupidity
Editor, The Pitt News,

If I had been looking'for an
excellent example of Alexander
Pope’s adage “A little learning
is a dangerous thing." I think I
,could have found it in Matthew
Nesvisky’s witty dissertation. on
folk music (October 4, 1961).

Not only does he commit the
sin of’ editorially sampling three
tunes as invalid examples, but
he also fails to realize that a
folk song is not meant to be a
musical or lyrical masterpiece.

When the French stormed the
Bastille crying and singing
“Liberte, Equalite, Fraternite,” I
am sure that their meter, rhyme,
and good lyric structure were
not their prime concern. Yet
people are moved when they are
reminded of the revolutionary
event by history, a novel of
Dickens, or a revolutionary folk
song.

A genuine American folksong
like Jim Crow would probably
impress Mr. Nesvisky as being
boring, inane and repititious —-
unless he had a. knowledge of
“Jim Crow, the slavery problem
in the area at the time, and the
compassion for freedom that-Jim
Crow’s followers felt.

The most embarrassing ques-

tion that Mr. Nesvisky could be

asked at this point is “How
many of the ‘guitar plunkers’
did you consult before writing
your article?” I would suggest
t the ‘next. time hepass

es a_
of th mule; wa“

deeply or not at all .t.,.”

For New*Magazine

Editor, The Pitt News,
-In recent years the student

body of the University has in--

creased in level of intelligence

and sophistication. Because of

this change there is a need for
a magazine that will appeal to

. the varied interests of the stu-

dent population.

Such a magazine would in-
clude satire, sophisticated hu-
mor, creative literature and cri-
ticism. ’

'We feel that a magazine of
this type is definitgély lacking at
the University, and We are in-
terested in’ initiating one. Be-

M fore, however, such a magazine

can be approved by the Board

of Student Publications .there i

must be widespread interest
among the students, a supply of
worthwhile material, and an in-
dustrious staff. I
If anybody is sincerely inter-

Physics Maior Raps
Sane's Berlin Stand

Editor, The Pitt News,

This morning I noticed an edi-
torial 'by John Crosby posted on
the Physics Department bulletin
board, placed there by the Stu-
dent Committee for a Sane Nu-
clear Policy.

The point of the editorial
seemed to be “Why Fight a nu-

clear war over half a city?” and

the editorial had a note appended
to it by the SCSNP requesting
that those who agree with the
editorial write anyone from their
Congressman to the President,
Ufging "for a peaceful settlement
in Berlin. , ‘

I am writing to you because
while I would like to see a nego-
tiated peace settlement in Berlin,
I am not willing to surrender
the city as the SCSNP seems to
be, willing to do,

Granted, sitting and talking at
a table is a_ much better way to
1'eS01V€ arguments than is swap-
Ding cities in_ a nuclear war, but
Why should we negotiate under

I threat?

Let us negotiate if ‘we can do
so honorably and with the hope
Of genuine gain for world peace,
but let us have the courage to
Stand UP for our cause, running
the risk of nuclear war if nec-
essary, rather than cravenly

backing Off_ from every Com- 4....
mumst-created crisis until there

is nothing left for which we
could ﬁght.’

Repieui of“Memo~ to JFK’

‘With ‘Gloomy Subject’

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

The recently—published collec-
tion of essays, Memo To JFK
(_Putnam‘s Sons; 313 pp.; $4.50),
deals with the most gloomy’ sub-
ject of all: our present world.

But the gloom is somewhat dis-
sipated, says Robert E. Kintner in
the foreword to the book, because
of “man’s ability to communicate
and eloquently
on a mass scale.”

A confirmed pessimist might
‘say that this merely meanswe
can get all the bad news faster,
but the writers of Memo To JFK,
be they optimists or pessimists,
would all agree with Kintner.

Written by Newsmen

For the 1'1 chapters of the book
are all written‘ by news corres-
pondents for the National Broad-
casting Company. Writing in this
country‘and\in nine others, these
journalists have analyzedithe Eu-
ropean and Asian nations in which
they are working in relation to
our new Administration.

Being newsmen, these writers
present their seemingly careful-
ly chosen opinions in generally
brisk, to-the-point prose. This
may not make for great literary
style, although some of the men
have done almost as much'writ-
ing as fact-chasing, but for cur-
rent events study, nothing better
could be asked for. _

Irving R. Levine, for example,
presents a greatly-needed outline
of the present situation in Italy.
By reiterating the modern history
of that country with the valuable
journalistic techniques of elimi-
nating the unimportant and em-
phasizing that which relates to
his audience, Levine explains not
only the present state of Italian

politics, but what it will mean to  a tmineeship in LJ.ub1jana’,YugO_ I

us in the future.
‘Uglies’ Covered
Much the same of this reportage
can be seen in Cecil Brown’s ﬁl-
ing on “The Switzerland of Asia,"

Japan. The Chief Far Eastern Cor-
respondent for NBC discusses the
little—publicized political jungle of
the Land of the Rising Toy-Fac-
tory, describing everything from
the position, or lack of position,
of the royal family, to the Com-
munist movement, to the unique
‘Japanese conservative growth.
The “Big Uglies” of o_ur time,
Russia, Red China, Germany,
are, of course, also covered.

the aroma of the newspaper
morgue, but for a general roundup
of today’s international situation
in simple, straight-forward, .and
validly-opinionated prose, Memo
To JFK is recommended.

‘Spartans Out To
Stop Pitt Streak

When _ the Panther soccer

team hosts Michigan State

-Saturday morning, a couple

of streaks’ go on the line, and
one of them will end.
Seemingly without anyone
noticing them, the charges of Cat
Coach Leo Bemis have gone
through seven games without de-
feat, recording ﬁve wins and two
ties since losing to Howard Uni-

~versity, 3-1, midway through last

season.

The_ Spartans, on the other hand,
have -never lost to a Pitt soccer
team, and have a strong enough
squad that they will be favorites
to preserve their streak and shat-
ter ‘the Panthers’. .

Depth Better Now

The contest is scheduled for
10:30 a.m. at the football practice
field," _

Coachllemis admits the op-
ponent will be tough, but in-
, sists that “we will be too. Our

depth is better than at any
time before, and the boys are

hustling ‘to keep their starting
positions.”

Bemis singled out Pete Smith
for praise for his contribution to

‘the 4-3 upset of Akron last week.

f‘Pete was passing Very well, and
had several shots that just missed

being goals.”

Smith will be at outside left
for the Panthers Saturday, with
Nick Bares, Corky Cuthbert, Sam
Donatelli, and possibly Eric .Weir
across‘ the line. Tarasi and Lib-
erati man the halves, with Chuck

iDunbar, Hannington Okoth, and

Steve Daniels at the fullback
slots. Who will be at goal is still
undecided.

Coaches ‘Push’ Eleven

For Inspired Threat S   .

By JIM 0’BRIEN
. _ ' Sports Editor
West Virginia, the ‘annual “breather” which usually

leaves the Panthers gasping for air,‘ipulls out of Morgantown
thisweek and ventures eastward to engage their tri-state
enemies at Pitt Stadium this Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

On Monday the Panther braintrusts, i.e. the coaches by* ‘

trade, seemed highly concernedover the "Mountaineer in-
vasion. They had a meeting in the Field House conference
‘room with a full caucus, and someone, most likely John
Michelosen, must have really been‘ ﬁlibustering.

This reporter was waiting to see
Frosh Coach Bill Kaliden. We de-
termined his presence by the pres-
ence of his gleaming red convert.
ible‘ parked in front of the Field
House. At ﬁve o’c1ock it was still
there, and the coaches were still
at it. '

This lengthy gabfest even cut
into the scheduled practice ses-
sion. The coaches appeared later
with bleary eyes, most of them
having failed to sleep for the last
couple of days. “I’ll never sleep
it that pass defense doesn"t’ tight-
en up,” Carl DePasqua, the tutor
of this department moaned.

Steve Petro. a coach who is
Personally insulted when his
‘team 1138885. is still fretting over
the team attitude. "‘I don’t un-
derstand these kids today,” he
sighed. “They have much. more
natural talent than we did, but
they don’t seem to really care.

“Before the Washington game
they all ate atfull meal -very com-*
fortably,” Petro pointed out. “Why
when I Played we were too n'erv- »
ous to eat anything but our finger-
nails." ,

Mounties Pose Threat

So the coaches’ tasks this week
is to implant the idea that West
Virginia, despite losing 18 games ,
in a row before last week, and
despite losing 42-0 last year to
‘the Cats, can easily register Pitt’s
third straight loss in the recor
books this weekend. -

The players are belaboring
the fact that they should be
3-W0. right now. but if Paul Mar.-
tha .hadn’t got off a one-in-a-

‘million dash in Miami they
0011111 just as well be 0-3 now,
too.

The Panthers have got to quit
their turtle act, i.e. hiding under
their shells after they get ahead. ,
Everyone has been blaming the 
defensive secondary for the defeat, K
and it’s really the fault of both
phases of the game.

West Virginia got back on the winning trail last week

by defeating Virginia Tech after having been Winless in‘ 18
games. The Mounties will be trying their best to make it
two straight at the expense of their big city rivals on Satur-

’ A win against Pitt is a most treasured thing in Mountie
S land. It is the game that they point for every year and the
players are always ﬁred up to the ‘hilt for the Panther battle.

lowers they need only remember the 1959 game between the

Virginia players did not hear 
aboutdthat. We lost 23.15.

If anyone needs a further
refresher they can recall an-
other team that -I played for.‘
In 1958 we were bowl-bound
when we met a supposedly 
T, _  weak Nebraska team. A real V 
'30], Timmeman breather, everyone said. Ne- Jim Moss’
braska won 14-7 and we forgot about spending New Year’s
day in the Sunny South.

Hove Cocky QB

The Mountaineers are led by a cocky sophomore quar-
terback, Fred Colvard. Early in the season Colvard was ask-
ed how to pronounce his name by a sports announcer. The
quarterback supplimi the information and added, “You’d
better learn it right, because you’re going to be using it a lot.”

, Whether Colvard plays as good as he talks will be deter-
" . mined on Saturday. He has gotten good performances out of
-Jéhis team so far this year.

After having lost their first two games to Richmond
and Vanderbilt, Colvard rallied his teammates to play
inspiring ball against Syracuse before going down to a
close defeat. Last week they achieved what they had
waited two years for. \

Colvard, who can run and pass with equal adeptness,
will be ﬂanked in the starting backﬁeld by Jim Moss, Tom
Woodeshick and Glenn Holton.

The starting Mountaineer line averages 212 pounds and
is led by 235 pound center, Pete Goimarac, a much sought-
after star in his prep school days, which were spent here in
Western ‘Pennsylvania.

 We Can't Be Overeonfidenf

The one factor Mountaineer Coach Gene Corum will
probably count on is overconﬁdence by the Pitt squad. I
hope our players read this so they are reminded of the
two upsets I ‘remember.

This I doubt, however, since a team 'doesn’t usually get
overconﬁdent after losing two straight games. I think most
of our overconﬁdence was knocked out of us by Washington.

We will have to be on our toes for 60 minutes .on Satur-
day because this Mountaineer squad will be shooting the

freshman gridders have come up
with their own alphabet group,
the F—Boy-s. Unlike the C-Boys
who were called that because all
their last names began with the

their monicker from their first

Freud and Fran, M-azurek and
Novak respectively, are the re-

Novak does not try to draw

questioned about his running

“Navy is always in excellent

Pitt coach Carl Rees, as he re-
