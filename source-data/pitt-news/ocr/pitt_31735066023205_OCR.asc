long after their reign is ‘over.
That’s not necessarily the case for

past Pitt Homecoming Queens, but

the course of the lives of five

' taken some interesting twists. '

In 1971 the University crowned

its first “Pitt Woman,”. in an
 attempt to get away from the

title, Homecoming Queen.

A The necktie apparently has more
importance than has been attri-

buted to it — or so says the '

Neckwear Association of America.
In a press release sent to The Pitt
News, the association claimed that
“recently...the necktie surfaced as
the first deliberate visual indication
of a revived (Carter) administra-
tion,” showing up around the
necks of such unlikely persons as
chief of staff Hamilton Jordan and
press secretary Jody Powell. Both_
were noted casual dressers in the
pre-Carter era.
“It became clear that when the
C? White House wished to present a

 take-charge image, it donned a

necktie,” the release added.

rector of the neckwear association,
said that “a,tie has a visual

Last year, the allocations com-
mittee turned down a BAS request

~ that funds be allocated tova lecture

by Baraku. However, according to
SGB President Stan Galanski, the
allocations committee and SGB did
not realize Baraku’s stature as a
prominent scholar and author at

A that time.

Of the $1700 that has been

"Actress Jane Fonda and her husband, political activist Tom

allocated for Baraku’s Black Week
appearance, $1500 will be given as
an honorarium, and $200 will be
provided for Baraku’s travel
expenses. .

Baraku will be traveling from

In other business, SGB member

“We asked the food service why

inﬂation,” said Park.

“The food service responded by
saying that giving out these items
creates a one-to-one relationship
between the cafeteria manager and ~

Donna Farey, queen for 1977,

“unique.” That was the first year
that Pitt students elected a

Farey, who received a degree in

According to Biehl, their pre-
ference generally followed the
guidelines for dress given by John
Malloy in his book, “Dressing for

' Success.’ ’

“The two best colors for suits are
usually grey and navy blue, and
any sort of conservative tie is good:
solid ties, straight" ties, club ties
(the ties with an insignia stamped
on the front, also known as Ivy
League ties), paisleys or plaid

ties,” sid Biehl in paraphrasing I

Malloy and the student survey.

be no loss of jobs and no economic
upheaval,” said Fonda.

“If we can’t ﬁnd a way through
conservation aloneto reduce the
consumption of electricity by four
or 10 percent, we’re ﬁnished as a

'. country,” added Hayden.

“I understand why the utilities
think otherwise. It’s because they
make their money off large power
plants, offnuclear plants, and they
make money off saving
energy. But that’s what the nation
has to do, and the utilities are
going to have to become energy
service stations,, helping people
save, rather than be energy
promoters that help people waste.”

According’ to Hayden, the 80s
will,be a replay of the 1930s with a
total collapse of the economy
leading to serious citizen response
as prices and unemployment
continue spiraling upward.

“We believe that we are _a
defeated nation economically,”
said Hayden. “Our tax dollars and

ingly out of the United States to
rebuild the competitive .economics

Renaissance-I:
  - Failed Urban
Renewal?

’ Renaissance I, the effect of which students from
Pitt’s School of Social‘ Work viewed during the Fifth
Annual Urban Analysis this weekend, is the/premier
example of the attempts at urban renewal in the
United States. The first renewal project initiated

under the federal Urban Renewal Act, Renaissance I a

shows the peculiar and sometimes detrimental
consequences of renewal in this country, whichhas
‘depended on private developers to complete

_, reconstruction projects in deteriorating downtown
areas. _ < ‘

t Karen Metzinger, Supplements Director

/

Under the federal law, private real estate

developers received low-cost loans to purchase and
improve property within downtown Pittsburgh. The
developers completed plans for construction and
leased the space, in the buildings planned to be built
after buying land. The inevitable result of this
method of renewal has been the great growth of
commercial sites because they offer developers high
projits. Because of deterioration or destruction of
the housing stock in inner cities, developers find that
building apartments or other residences do not offer
the promise of financial gain that they need.
To correct the imbalance between commercial
[development and residential growth, the federal
‘government has attempted various public housing
programs, ’which have proven to be moderately
successfulat the most and outright disastrous at the
worst. The oldest and most visible of these programs

is one federally funded public housing pperated by]

local housing authorities in the United States. While
these projects havehelped supply homes for many
poor, they have faced numerous problems as
inflation and age have combined to make them

harder to maintain at a price that the very poor can ‘

afford." The best measure of their success might be
the fact the first project, built in St. Louis in 1946,
was demolishedthis year. As inflation continues and
Congress remains unwilling to fund such housing

similar fates because local authorities cannot pay for
repairs and keep rents at the legal level of one-quarter
of the occupant’s monthly income. ' I

Public housing projects (many with years-long
waiting lists) have never been able to meet the full
need for housing people with moderate or low
incomes, and the government has tried subsidizing
apartment complexes, underwriting housing
rehabilitation and subsidizing rents to fill the ' gap.

. Of all ‘these methods, housing rehabilitation seems
the most -promising, but was curtailed by the Nixon?

rehabilitation projects in Detroit and Philadelphia.
Duringthe Carter administration, rehabilitation
has come into vogue again and has ‘been used

Reader: Cuba NeedsPr0tecti0rz of Soviet Umbrella J in

Once again, the question of
defense of the Soviet Union has
been placed before the worker’s
movement with Carter's announce-
ment last week of an escalation of
U.S. surveillance and military
forces in the Caribbean to counter
the “recently discovered" Soviet
‘.‘combat brigade” in" Cuba.

Who does Cartef think he's
kidding? It is the Americans, of
course, who have a genuine foreign
military base on Cuban soil. at
Guantanamo Bay! The blustering
about “Russian aggression” com-
ing from the people, who launched
the Bay of Pigs invasion and spun

endless plots to assassinate Castro,
is the height of imperialistic
arrogance. '
Irritated by the presence 90
miles off the American coast of a_
country which threw out Americans
by overturning capitalism, and
which is militarily allied with the
Soviet Union. the sabre-rattling
administration and yahoos in
Congress want to turn the
Carribean back into an “American
lake.” In the face of renewed Cold
War bombasts coming out of
Washington, we insist that Cuba
has the right and duty to take all
necessary defense measures: the

Stzck to Facts
In Editorials

I would like to take this
opportunity to voice my objection to
a recent Pitt News editorial. On
Friday. October 5. The Pitt News
criticized the Student Government
Board for having their weekly
meetings on Tuesday evenings. It
was pointed out that the lateness of
the hour prevented many students
from attending this‘ important

function. ,
Fine. The paper has the"right to

make critical judge_ng1e‘;t_’ts._g_gl-low-‘.

C 

_ever, for the Editorial Staff ‘to ‘
present their assumptions as facts

is irresponsible, and lacks any
resemblance of .professionalism.
The editorial asserts that Tom
Kunkel’s school schedule caused
the Student Government Board to
re-arrange its meeting schedule to
accomodate him. However. no-
where in the editorial does it
provide a hard, factual quote from
any of the Board’s members or
even from Start Galanski; that such
an arrangement was made because
of one person’s schedule.

The Pitt "News editorial staff
must remove themselves from
spreading gossip and loose‘ conclu-
sions based on loose assumptions.
Stick to the facts, and avoid your
obvious innuendos. '

It would have been acredible
article if they had someone to admit
this practice and agreed to be
quoted. The editorial staff owes an
apology to Tom Kunkel and to the

students of this university. The
meeting time of the Student
Government Board is a good issue
to pursue. -But please remember,
Pitt News: you're writing a college
newspaper and not a college
National Enquirer.

,To say that Cincinnati’s football
coach Ralph Staub is impressed
‘ n with Pit-t"s Panthers would be like
saying the Philadelphia Phillies
went down the chute this past
baseball season. 5

Here are a few of Staub’s
opinions about the Panthers:
“Pittsburgh is a better football
team than their record. They lost
to ‘No'rth"Carolina. When I look at
their people, I scratch my head and
wonder ‘how they lost to North
1 Carolina.”
lv  ' ,
l" P. ' ; “The thing that is most awesome
l L~._,,’about Pittsburgh is when you look
at their offensive line. I don’t know
of another team that is as big" as
"this. This is one of the’ reasons I
want to impress on you what kind
of job we've got in front of us.

/'_‘~_

 

“Hugh Green is probably’ a little
 more nasty than our own Farley
 ’ Bell (Cincinnati’s All-American
'  ‘candidate at defensive end). By
511:‘  looking at the ﬁlms of Green, he
'7 not only wants to tackle you, he
wants to bury you under the turf.
,“We know they (Pitt) have great
strength at the quarterback posi-
tion,” ‘ ._
.But don't get the impression
 Staub is petriﬁed by the thought of
, playing the Panthers. Far from it.
Despite the Bearcats’ 1-3 record,
1 _,/he feels his team is capable of
V giving the Panthers a real scare at
.;,,this Saturday’s Homecoming con-
7 ' attest. '
" “I think we’ll surprise some
people,” said i/Staub. ,

l_'.
‘.

 

 

{.2

 

For the season, Cincinnatiis‘ 1-3,
having defeated Villanova, while
losing to‘ Southern Mississippi,
Louisville and North Carolina. The

" 35-14 loss to North Carolina last

Saturday should be of particular
interest to Pitt, because the
Panthers were never really intheir
game with the Tar Heels, a 17-7
loss three weeks ago.

Cincinnati and North Carolina’ '
were tied at the half, 14-14, before

Carolina’s depth and talent ‘wore
down the Bearcats. For this reason
Saturday’s game may be a bit more
difficult than had been origi-nally
perceived. . .

However, Cincinnati will come to
Pittsburgh «missing one of ’its
biggest guns. Two weeks ago,
tailback Allen Harvin was injured.
Harvin, who rushed for over 1,200
yards last year, will not play’ in
Saturday’s game. His place in the
backﬁeld is being taken by James
‘Bettis. ' I n -

Other Bearcat standouts on
offense are quarterback Tony
Kapetanis, .fullback Mike Schnei-
der, and split end Ralph Williams.

’The secondary is probably the
strength of Cincinnati's defense,
led by cornerback Mike Clark! and
free safety Dan Kellet.. ’

The Panthers will be trying to
improve on their offense this week,
which came to life late in the game
.with Boston College when Dan
Marino was playing quarterback.

But Jackie Sherrill ﬁgures to use '

op-20 Pitt Draws Praise from Cincinnati Coach Staub

Sherrill said.

Marino much the same way he has
up to this point. ,

“Ricky (Trocano) will start,”
“He's been in the
games, he’s been in the trenches,
and he will not make some of the
mistakes that a young ‘quarterback
will make.” 7

As for Marino, his freshman
from‘Central Catholic, Sherrill was
a bit more reserved. “I have a

nickname for him——legend. I think
’ he’s a legend before his own ‘time.

And we really don't know if he can
do it yet.”

are deceiving. When Tiedtke touches the ball, he

time that he was a freshman. He played in the center
forward position and was named captain and MVP
his seniorseason. He was also named to the all-
district team for ‘three years as a member of the
number one team in that district. Not to mention the
fact that he waswthe team’s leading scorer for three
years as he scored over 20 goals a season. He tallied
21 last year with an average of 2.5 goals per game.
Because the high school team played in the winter,’
Tiedtke was able to participate in an under-19 league
in the fall ‘and spring of each year. Here again,-

unimportant to players on opposing teams.

,,,,,,. Hustle, speed, determination and sheer guts have

"-made Tiedtke one of Pitt’s most‘ promising players 0
1979. . . ‘
\ Tiedtke began to play soccer when he was 11 years
old and has played the sport ever since. He took up
soccer as an alternative to football. The Panthers are
now grateful that he made that decision.
Besides soccer, Tiedtke was always a strong
contender in cross country and track. . -
“Running and soccer are very related because of
all the running that you do duringa game,” said
Tiedtke. Running long distance like I did in cross
. country naturally helps because it gives you a good

wind for the ‘long games and it builds the endurance‘ R
factor. Also running the mile in track turns the speed

Won to work too.” , " -A
 The past four years of Tiedtke’s soccer career have

Tiedtke emerged as a leader in, scoring as he played.

‘with a number of older teammates and opponents.

In both thehigh school and league games he was‘

under the instruction of coach John Saba, the man he

credits with teaching him all the fundamentals of the 

sport. - ,
“John was a professionalin Lebanon before he
came to Fort Worth,” said Tiedtke. \“_He taught me
just about everything that I know about playing
soccer. I owe almost all my skills and know-how to
him.” I A ' ‘ ’

‘ Saba certainly must have thought agreat deal of
Tiedtke in return; This past weekend he flew from
Texas to watch the Pitt—Bucknell contest in which the
Panthers lost 2-0. ' '

“At home,\Eric’stea‘mmates had played with him
for many years and they knew exactly what he was

capable of doing,” said Saba. “Scoring goals‘ comes - 

been memorable. He was a starter on his high school ». natural to Eric, and I think that as soon as the team

gets used to working with him he will begin to score a
lot of goals up here for Pitt.” ‘, B

After being recruited by a number of teams '

(among them was Southern Methodist University
who is presently ranked number four in the nation)
Tiedtke decided to attend Pitt because his family was
about to move to Pittsburgh.

“I thought that by going to a school on the East
Coast I would be able to get more recognition,
because Eastern teams as a whole seem- to get more/of
it,”' said Tiedtke.
because I’m now‘ getting a lot of playing time and
experience in the time that I have played. Plus I have
a great bunch of guys to work with.,” .
. / —
Soccer has\been*known to accomodate any size"

athlete. There are no prerequisites, like beingat least «

6-foot-4 or weighing over 200 pounds. What Tiedtke
may lack,in stature he makes up for in speed and
quickness.

/

“In the air I won’t be as good for head balls, but I  Y‘. .
think that I’m fast enough to make up for "what I I

lack in height and width,” said Tiedtke. ‘.«‘on the.

ground I can be faster because I have a smaller center . 4 i 

of gravity. This is why Coach Bemis is switching Bob

Hughes and myself at center forward. That position - "
needs more height because when playing t-here you A “ ‘
are the target man. I think I could be more effective '

at wing.”

When considering all the goals that Tiedtkeihasi

scored in the past, why is it that he has only scored-
one goal this season? Even more importantly why
hasn’t the entire team been scoring goals? ~

“For me, I think that it is because I have-been-a bit
over-anxious at getting a goal, besides the fact that I,
feel a lot of pressure in being ’a freshman on a whole
new team,” said Tiedtke. “I really think that those
goals are going to come because I’m too accustomed-
to scoring them. I can't go cold turkey.

“As a team I thing that we definitely need to work
on the way we finish. It takes us a while to get settled
down and we seem to let up after a score. We seem to _
have problems in getting back up again after we have
been scored on. If we can maintain our intensity,_”
said Tiedtke, “we can win games—the rest of the
ones remaining. . ‘

Despite the fact that he Panthers are 1-5-2,
Tiedtke still remains optimistic about the final games
of the 1979 season. He believes that the team has the
potential to score three or four goals a game and the
problem is about to get solved. ’

“It’s not that we lack a scoring punch; it's just that

it hasn’t come into being yet, said Tiedtke. ‘‘There’s' '
a great potential on this team, plus we are a very’ ‘
young group. 1 think that the problem is on its way  f

to being solved.

Tiedtke could play a big part in beginning to find a

' solution to the Panthers sc’oring problem tonight at 7 I ~
p.rn. when he and his teammates face Davis and. .
Elkins. One way or another, in this game or the next, .»  - .
Tiedtke’s sure to have the Panthers saying, “Thank-‘S  ~ 3

you, Fort Worth, Texas.”

“I’m happy with the decision‘

“Record Rama
Neglected

Ithought your issue on record stores in
the area reasonably accessable from
campus (Sept. '26, 1979) was well thought
out and well-written and covered this

- under-inked topic from an interesting

point of view. However, I must take issue
with one statement in your tabular
summaries of the shdps, and point out
that if you were trying to be complete,
you may have “slipped a disc.”

Your statement on the service at Jim's

' Records in Bloomfield——“...they’re there

when you need them”——-carries a
negative connotation with it that you
probably did not mean to transmit. Their
low-key approach to salesmanship, if you
need help they're willing. but if you
prefer to browse for hours on end you’re
welcome to, I ﬁnd to be a welcome relief
to the constant “can I help you’s" that
drive this record collector nuts. Thus, I
felt that any misunderstanding that might
‘their business should be
rectified.

Secondly, it seems that‘you forgot to

’ mention “Record-Rama” in Etna among

your record stores. This J store carries
current releases, albeit at high prices. but
its forte is oldies——boasting international

trade in the singles market, and a‘

basement full of used records that sell for
$2 per disc. This store contains the only

computer-based. acquisition/distribution'

system in the area.

Again I thank you for an informative
article. and I hope to be able to enjoy
reading, your feature articles for some
time.

Jeffrey L.‘ Rinsheid
’ More On
  A Max

This is’ in response to the letter by Mr.
Jeffrey Barent in the Wednesday.
September 19 editionlof the Showcase.

v First. however. a little background
seems extremely in order. On Tuesday,
September 11, WDVE disc _jockey
Maxwell voiced a rather strong opinion to

an event which should have prompted an '

explanation from “The Pittsburgh Press"
and its music critic. Pete Bishop, but did

‘the background knowledge

not. It seems the night before,
September 10, Max revealed his
disagreement to Mr. Bishop’s record

' review of the new Led Zeppelin album;

*ence Mr. Barent’s letter.

The following night (Sept. 11) Maxwell
got a call at the station from a young lady
who had circulated a_ petition that
described Mr. Bishop’s talents as a
record reviewer as being a bit less than
adequate. The petition had a few
hundred signatures, all in agreement.
This young lady and a few of her friends
personallydelivered the petition to the
“Pittsburgh Press,” asking for it to be

’ given to Pete Bishop. The next day she

called Mr. Bishop_ to ask him his opinion
of the signatures. He replied that. he
never’ heard, saw, or touched any such
document. A I V
Obviously the young lady was upset.
Having 200 person's opinions disregard-
ed as that of junk mail is not exactly
courteous behavior from one so presti-
gious as that of a newspaper’is music
critic. This story so enraged Maxwell,
that again he criticized the ability of Mr.
-Bishop.

/

You described Max’s behavior as being '

a bit strong, but don’t you think he did
stand up for the values he believed in?
Obviously having many years in as a
qualiﬁed disc jockey, heis not exactly
new to the record industry and does have

criticize others. You, however,‘ probably
do not. . ,
~'Throughout your .entire letter you
voiced your opinion. Maxwell voiced his,
as did Mr. Bishop. .

But one of the many opinions you
voiced was how “Mr. Max” was too
gutless to reveal his last name; . In
response to this is a reply’ by, “Mr.”
Maxwell himself: ‘

‘.‘Maxwel1 is the name I‘ havegone by '
I doAhave 'a‘ .

for years on the radio.
Christian name, and that's the same
name that’s on my marriage license. The
radio and my personal life " are two
separate lives, and by not using- my

surname on tlie air, I intend to keep them A ‘

separated.” ' ,
Maxwell may have been a bit strong in

his convictions, but" to speak out on a

subject and uphold one’s beliefs seems to

be a characteristic a bit more admirable .l

than ignoring an0ther’s opinion and not
becoming involved. Instead of question-
ing Maxwell’s response to the incident,
Mr. Pete ‘Bishop’s lack .of response
should be that in question.

Decade
Could Be Better

_I thank you for your recent article on
the Decade and the fine shows that
Danny Kresky has brought to Pitts-
burgh. The coverage was long overdue
and I was happy to see a magazine
devote a cover story to this great club

rock concept. .r'~

I have attended many of the
Decade/Kresky shows and I have
found them to be some of the best I
have ever seen. Especially, The
Fabulous ‘Poodles, The Police, Joe
Jackson and the last David Johansen
show were fantastic rock’n’roll con-
certs. Being able to see these groups in
a small place like the Decade added
much to the special and intimate
feeling.

However, I‘ feel that your article did
not deal with‘ some of the problem.
areas or inconveniences in the Decade.
For instance, I am speaking of the /
outrageous .price of $1.15 for ap-

' proximately a seven ounce bottle of
' beer, which are incurred during these

national shows. Why must these prices

‘ be so high?

“ Also, why couldn’t Kresky. and/or

the Decade perhaps even institute a ~~

policy of restricted drinking on these
national shows so that‘ an’ underage.
crowd could gain adrnittaneee. This
idea has worked before in clubs like the
Tommorrow ' Club in Youngstown,

I Ohio.

And vfinal1y—an issue which the ar-
ticle dealtiwith toiiall-certain e‘xt’e‘rit—
why can’t the Decade, if it is to house
these, concerts, be-.: somehow

remodeled, reconstructed or even
_ replantned to accommodate more
..people.

Or at lea$.t,'provide a more
comfortable setting.‘

I H I open my suggestions and com-

ments to the Decade and Mr. Kresky to
reply through Showcase magazine.

calibre acts. Working underits present J

It would be interesting to see ‘what
part of Homecoming students place the

most emphasis on. Would it be the,

naming_ of the King and Queen, a\night
of cheap drinking at the local bars, the
football game or maybe, just maybe,
the Homecoming concert?

Most likely it’,isn’t the concert.
Although many students are already
complaining about this year's
Homecoming concert, Livingston
Taylor in the Student Union Lower
Lounge, few seem willing to challenge
the decision of the Homecoming
Committee or the policies within the
university which prevent the possibility
of bigger and better shows occurring in

the future; either at Homecoming or‘

other times during the year.
Understandably, there are inherent
problems to bringing larger acts to Pitt
at the end of the 70s. The most
obvious reasons are the tremendous
finances involved with bringing in high

I.

financial allotments, PUPC cannot
affordto bring in a top act, sell tickets

to students at a reasonable price, make '

a reasonable profit (or break even for

_ that matter) and" still ..,continue to

promote the other activities students
expect, appreciate and deserve.
Another problem is a‘ university
policyiwhich prohibits PUPC or any
other student organization from
promoting a concert outside of the
university. This would exclude the
Syria Mosque or Carnegie Music Hall.
The three suitable places remaining to
stage a concert; the auditorium at
David Lawrence Hall, the Field House,
and Pitt Stadium, also present
problems. ‘David Lawrence only seats

_ 1,000 people andiwould require a sell-

out at a high ticket price to afford a top

band. And the possibility of getting a

tion to ‘use the Field House or stadium

A Favorini believes that “the classics
open the students and audiences horizon
for potential; they force us to encounter
different imagery.” Also, he thinks that
University Theater has a responsibility to

University Theater looks for and seeks

University Theater’s accomplishments
speak for themselves. Year after year
their performances are rated as some of
the best. not only in the area,‘but across
the country. Last" year's “Much Ado

P the best productions of Shakespeare.
They have also made the semi-ﬁnals

tasks us to accept the fourth "dimension,

that love and madness are timeless.

Malcolm McDowell makes such a

to control these functions. The Ripper’s
escape into the future. noted on the time
meter when the machine returns. gives
Wells the encouragement he needs to
ﬁnally use his device. and track down the
criminal. _ '

The interesting thing ‘is how the
madman seems to adapt so well into
modern society where his. or any violence
isn't legendary. merely a fact of life.

“Ninety years ago." says the Ripper.
.“l was a freak: today I'm an amateur."

Wells however. is lost amidst ele-
vators. escalators. telephones. taxicabs.
fast food. and liberated sexual attitudes
that are far more advanced than even he.
a revolutionary futurist in his time. could
ever imagine.

Malcom McDowell, as H.G. Wells, in a scene from “Time After Time.”

Amy Robbins is brillian as the foreign
currency teller that converts both Wells
and the Ripper’s money to American
dollars, providing the clues for the
inventor as well as falling in love with

him. Their romance is one of the nicest _

parts of the film. Robbins is lovely to
watch_. a thrill to listen to. and gives a
performance that is very" therapeutic: one
can ﬁnd no reason for Wells not to fall in
love with this modern American woman.

Meyer. weaves -his story together
beautifully for his directorial debut. He
keeps the stark evilness of the Ripper in
accordance with the past portrayals of the
madman. Looking through the Ripper’s
eyes on traditionally foggy London‘ streets
is safe. for both Meyer and the audience.
This is how we've known the Ripper. from
the inside. This is how we've seen his
victims. before and after his viciouslness.
Only once does Meyer cut away from this
view. and only briefly.

And who better to pursue
trailblazer of death than Wells: a

this

sophisticated. respected and slightly
removed man in his time? Suddenly he
becomes the American screen hero: an
innocent, confused.. yet
dividualist with high ideals and beliefs
that he’s liberal enough to bend in the
name of love and_;justice. And how he

does bend. from capping off an entirely
pleasant first day with Ms. Robbins.

waking up with her after an entirely»

pleasant night. and then stooping to buy a
gun in a moment of protective passion,
hoping to defend the love that takes
precedence over all.

Meyer has taken a delightfully unique
idea. an excellent cast with incomparably
bright performances. a good setting and a
ﬁne juxtaposition of periods. and has
written and directed a concise. suspens-
ful. romantic screenplay that makes for a
major ﬁlm. “Time After Time" is
Meyer’s contributions of guaranteed
good cinema. and tells us that‘ time

\\'llllOUt love is nothing but time: dark;

meaningless. and insufficient for

 Lab Theater

 Playhouse

By MARK HOLAN

Bill Royston and the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theater are back in business;
on a temporary. limited basis. Royston
has been named assistant director of the
Pittsburgh,Playhouse Theater Company

months of negotiations between. Royston
and Playhouse director Mark Lewis.
Royston cited. Donald Miller. drama/art
critic at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. as

acting as an‘ “arbitrator" during the
talks. ’ . '

Royston described the arrangement as

productionof the “The Possessed’."a

“The Possessed" was originally slated
to run as part of the Lab's ninth season,
intendedto have been devoted" to the
works of Katz. The season was cancelled
because of problems "with . CETA
(Comprehensive Employee Training Act)
production.

“One way or another all of-Leon's plays
will be produced in Pittsburgh." said
Royston. Even if the arangement with
the Playhouse doesn't work.

The Playhouse completed its run of
“Absent Friends" this weekend and
Point Park Theater Company will open

Contrary To Popular Belief ,
 Area Has Good Jazz Clubs

By PHIL CONTES

When Sonny Daye’s Stage Door

V closed last summer, many jazz lovers

thought they had lost their musical
mecca. But although Pittsburgh is far
from a jazz town like Chicago or New
York, there are quite a few clubs
offering good jazz. V

The Encore II on Liberty Avenue
downtown has jazz six nights a week. It
has a' very casual atmosphere and
drinks that are a bit_ more expensive,
like most bars with live music. Dinners
are also served. The Encore seats
about 65 to 75 people and although it .
tends to be quiet through the week, it
gets crowded on the weekends. ‘

Pete Bombar and Xanadu had‘ been '

playing at the Encore through the first
week in October. Xanadu is a fairly
competent jazz trio consisting of
keyboards, drums and bass. Bombar is
a guitarist from London whose music
is highly fused, a la Jeff Beck.

Two nationally’ known major talents

‘T will _be _appearing at the Encore in i ,
Pianist’ Gap Mangtone’

October.
(brother of Chuck) will appear October

. . 9-13 and organistplimmy McGriff is
 ~ scheduled for October 23-27. ‘

‘I The Encore isn’t'set up effectively;

  The stage is in the middle of. a long

Dan ce

' room. This is both an inefficient use of
‘ space and an ill arranged room =
 acoustically.

Daq’s in the Hyatt *House, also
downtown, is a posh cocktail bar. The
Al Dowe trio is currently performing.
Thevtnlav low-key and mellow jazz.

SHOWCASE on

-Daqzs is also bringing in national
acts and is well-equipped to do this
because it can seat 100 comfortably
with a good view of the stage. Billy
Ecksteinis coming this week and will
do two shows nightly. There will be a
$5 cover, but Eckstein should be worth"
the price. If the Eckstein shows are
successful, other major acts will be
booked.  _

Drummer Spider Rodinelli and his
band, Spider and Company, have
settled into another long term
engagement at the Encore in
Shadyside. Spider’s band has a
tremendous repertoire of classic and
modern jazz and when they are hot the
best jazz in Pittsburgh can be found at
the Encore.

The Encore, however, is a smallbar
and gets very crowded on the
weekends. To get a good seat with a
view of the musicians, it is necessary to
get there early." Also, the bar can get
very noisy providing another dis-
traction for the usually good. to ex-

cellent music. Per_haps_v thebefst plan  .
would beto go to the Encore on a less .  '

crowded weekday night. Drinks are

By CINDY HECKATHORN

Pittsburgh Ballet Theater opened its
tenth anniversary season last week at
Heinz Hall with an elaborate produc-
tion of the classic “Sleeping Beauty.”

_ The traditional fairy tale of a young
princess who sleeps for one hundred’
years until awakened by the kiss of a
prince was originally choreographed by
Marius Petipa to the music of
Tschaikovsky. Pittsburgh’s premiere
of Sleeping Beauty was staged by‘
Rosemary Valaire. who also assisted in
the American Ballet-Theater’s produc-
tion of this classic.
, ' The three evening and two -matinee
performances of “Sleeping. Beauty”
ran October 4-7, with Francesca
Corkle and Eleanor D’Antuono alter-
nating in the leading role of Princess

_- Aurora.’ This was Corkle’s premiere
performance with PBT after dancing

’ for ten years with New York’s Jeoffrey

Ballet.

D’Antuono, who danced in Satur-
dab’ eVening’s performance, had
previously performed the role with the
American Ballet Theater under
Valaire.

D’Antuono brought skill and life to
the performance, and was never over-
shadowed by the extravagant
costuming and settings. This was quite
an amazing feat considering the lavish-

\

ness of the production. Hundreds of
costumes _ were used, ranging from
courtly satin gowns to the costumes of
storybook characters.

Most of the scenes were set in the
palace, and. background settings in-
cluded thrones, marble archways, and
other appropriate palatial decor.

Although all of ‘ the color and con-
fusion of the props could have caused
the dancers to get lost, this was avoided
with the corps ide ballet working
together better than ever before.

Miguel Campaneria played the

prince opposite D’Antuono Saturday A .-

evening. Campaneria, who defected his
native Cuba while on tour in Canada,
is a powerful dancer, projecting perfect
control at all times.

The ballet was performed in a
prologue and three acts, with two in-
termissions. The fast pace of the
prologue and acts I and '11 made the
first two hours of the performance in-
credibly easy to watch. Act II con-
cluded with the kiss which awoke
Aurora and brought the kingdom back
to life after one hundred years under
the spell.

Act three consisted of the wedding
of Aurora and the prince. It was
mainly a vehicle to show off some very
fine solo performances by the wedding
guests, who included Red Riding
Hood, Puss-in-Boots, and the Lilac
Fairy. There was also a grand pas de

‘ deux betweentlie newlyweds.

Unfortunately, a lot of the dancing
in the Act III went unappreciated by

the audience, many_ people left the

theater during ,the wedding scene".
Auatlbte signs arose trom the audience
as the list of solo performers ‘arriving at 4
the wedding" grew ,increasingly_ longer.
In spite of audience reaction, the dan’- '
cers’ vitality did not diminish with the.

Recent paintings by Ken Batista are
currently on exhibition at the UP
(University of Pittsburgh) Gallery at the
corner of forbes Avenue and South
Bouquet Street in Oakland until October
28. _ .

This ‘very successful show_ exhibits
paintings on paper and canvas with an
unusual blend of abstract expressionism,
minimalism and abstract illusionism.

‘‘I see my paintings as one-act plays
which exist as interpretive documentaries
on an ever so common polarity; Conflict

narrations and the vehicles of interpreta-
tion (or the individual roles) are
ﬁgurative. However, they are not
renderings of characters which may seem
capable of motion. but rather visual
documentaries of the energies comprised
by each character. It is with these
ﬁgurative elements that,I. endeavor to
establish a compatible dialogue and react

These paintings"ar'e rentiniscent ‘of Cy-

tThey hint at universal explosions and
other worldly. forces that touch on

titles like “Ring-Aroung-The Triangle,”
and “Entrance Triangle; Stage Right.”

Batista cleverly uses elements of
abstract illusionism avoiding the gim-l
micky quality inherent in the genre.
There’s a frantic and dramatic quality to
these paintings, gr,_eat eruptive areas
juxtaposed with heavy sweeps of paint.
There is a vast spatial sensibility to these
paintings which Batista overlays.

Blue Oyster ult/ Rainbow Bring Heavy Rock ToArena 

Blue Oyster Cult/Rainbow . . '
Civic Arena ‘
October 5, 1979

By MARK MONAHAN

Long Island’s Blue Oyster Cult and
England’s Rainbow aren’t the most
commercially successful heavy metal
bands around but their solid and
aggressive performing skills keep them in
demand. ,

V Last Friday, while the Pirates were
socking it to the Reds, Blue Oyster Cult
and Rainbow pulverized a near capacity
audience at the Civic Arena with plenty of

loud and hard rock and stunning visual A

effects.

A newly revamped. Rainbow was first
up and led by X Deep Purple guitarist
Ritchie Blackmore, charged through an
hour long set of blitzkrieg fast,
powerhouse rock n’ roll.

Blackmore and drummef‘Cozy Powell
remain from, the last Rainbow line-up.»

while former Deep Purple bassist Roger
Glover, vocalist Grahm Bonnet and
keyboardist Don 'Airey, are the new
members.

“Eyes of the World”, “L0ve’s No
Friend of Mine”, “All Night Long” and
“Long Live Rock n’ Roll” were rock at it’s
fastest and most furious. Thisris one

' group which would never be mistaken for
the Captain and Tennille. '

Judging from Fridayis performance,
the new line up is an improvement. As
usual, at the center of Rainbow’\s
hurricane of sound was the impressive
guitar work of Blackmore and the
brilliance of Powell’s drumming. V

Blackmore burned up the fretboard of

his guitar with his thick fills and snakey V

leads while Powell delivereda solo that
nearly leveled the Arena.

Building from an eerie organ passage
by Airey, Powell pounded his. kit into
submission until a tape of the “1812
Overture” chimed in. He then crashed
his cymbals, in ‘time to the song’s
exploding cannons while the strobelights

the creativity of the solo. Even though
the fans loved Rainbow, Blackmore, they
refused to play an encore.

Blue Oyster Cult was up next. The ' T

much heralded laser light show was not
featured because the band felt the fan's
attention was taken away from the music.

The Cult is an interesting band in the
heavy metal field, and consists of ﬁve
men: Eric Bloom lead vocals and stun
guitar, Don “Buck Dharma” Roeser-lead
guitar, Allen Lanier guitars and key-

'boards and the Bouchard brothers, Joe

and Albert on bass and drums. Never
afraid to take chances with the lyrical
content of their songs, the Cult has two
real hits, “Don’t Fear the Reaper”, a
song about death and “Godzilla”, a
novelty hit about the man eating ﬁlmland
monster. ’ . l

The performance Friday was a well
balanced and well rehearsed blend of old
and new material, which showed off the
talent and diversity of the band's
members. . .

Although Bloom is the lead vocalist,
Roeser sang the leads _on one new song

“Mirrors” and “Don’t Fear the Reaper”
while bassist Joe Bouchard sang “Hot
Rails to Hell” and Albert sang “Cities on-
Flame”.

In addition to the‘ hard driving and

appealing nature of its music, the Cult = V

‘spiced up the proceedings with their own
brand of crazed wit: Albert Bouchard
donned a monster head during his drum
solo on “Godzilla”. Bloom, wearing a
Harley Davidson T-shirt, d_1:9.V.¢ .8
motorcycle onstage during “Born to be
Wild”. Bloom and Roeser shined the’
overhead lights off of, their -mirrored;

guitars while sparklers flew through the A 

air at the end of the night.

All in all, both the Cult and Rainbow I
‘ gave the crowd what they wanted, plenty
of loud and hard rock n’ roll music and _

even though both bands may not sell as

many records as Boston, Kansas __or " ‘

Foreigner, the dynamic abilities of
Blackmore and Powell and the appealing
weirdness of the Cult is always well
worth the price of admission.

Bryne sang “Don’t Worry About the
Gove_rnment”;'this year, he plans to go
. underground in “Life During War-_t
 time.” Fatalism is also much more
evident in songs like “Mind” where
’ Bryne tiredly reiterates all the ways he
, attempted to change a friend’s mind to
no avail. Finally, “Memories Can-’t
Wait” describes a condition of un-
breakable fascination backed with
_ music that‘ mirrors the out-of-control
patty. that dominates Bryne’s
imagination. . ' l —
As far as the music goes, the Talking
.Hea’ds have stayed with their syn-
copated, R&B style. However, the
electronics and effects that were sup.-
plied by Brian Eno on last year’s model
have been totally integrated into “Fear
of Music” to provide a feeling that can
be only described -a-s _ seventies
psychedlia. This may be due to the fact
that Eno has all but become the fifth
member of the band. ‘

Elton John Shows No

Fear of Music i
The Talking Heads"
Sire . _ - , ,
Last year, the most successful hard-
core New Wave act was t_he Talking
Heads. With. their top ‘twenty single.
“Take Me To The River” and their top
thirty album “More Songs About
Buildings and Food,” Talking Heads’
achievements were notable.

This year, with the increased ap-
pearance of pop/rock bands in the
charts, the Talking Heads are in the
‘position to deliver a strong follow-up.
Commercially, there is no doubt since-
“Fear Of Music” is currently in the top
third of the album charts. The calibre
of the music is, much stronger than
either of their previous albums.

 

 

 

Talking Heads (from left), Tina Weymouth, Jerry Harrison, David Byrne and
Chris Frantz have just completed their thirdvalbum. ‘ ~ ‘ ‘

Conceptually, this album toughens
up the band’s‘5a-vant-garde stance over
previous albums and rocks harder in
the bargain too.

This is -most’ evidenced in David

of the groups that represent the true
face of progressive rock and have done
it while gaining a large following.

, The Talking Heads are the only band
of the New Wave to become better with
each release‘. At this point they are one

production of “Victim of Love.” For
example, “Spotlight,” the first cution
the second side, never quite gets off the
ground. The repitition of ‘lyricsis
often «and overdone. It seems as
though there are only ten words to the
entire song. “Spotlight” flows like a . _
metronome into the next cut, “Street, . 1.;-A-.jT
Boogie”—same beat, same sound. 
The only difference is the lyricsgwhich ' B

“Victim of Love” could pass as the

work of some unknown disco singer
except for the distinctive and readily
identifiable voice of Elton John. As a
businessman, John cannot be wrong, '
but as a musician he is rapidly losing
the popularity and support of/many
loyal fans. Instead of saying
“Goodbye to the Yellow Brick Road’?
he is saying goodbye to us,

;The success’ of this album will
depend heavily on the demand for
music that enables people to use
whatever dance. steps they have
practiced. The fact that you can dance _
to this album is unquestionable but
other questions are naturally raised.
Specifically, why does Elton John
continue to produce music of this
calibre when he has proven that he can
write and sing excellently. In particu-
lar, songs like “Tiny Dancer,”
“Levon” and “Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road.” The cuts on this album,
“Born Bad,” “Street Boogie” and
others don’t even sound like they were
performed by the same artist.

Victim of Love
Elton John
MCA'

Elton John is a victim of love. This '
album makes it clear that he has been
suffering "and John seems willing to.
explain what has been troubling him.
Sadly, though,"the victim of this album
is not Elton John but rather those of us
who are relegated to listeningto it.,
John seems less concerned’. with
producing a high-quality album than
with slopping together one that will
sell. Clearly out for the sales, John has
utilized the‘ all-too-familiar “Put-a-
disco-beat-to-it” technique and, with
