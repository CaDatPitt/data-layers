Debate Sparks Meeting

SC Demands Student ODI Input

by JOAN EASTBOURN

The Student Government Board
meeting Thursday night opened
with a stiff debate between board
members and Tim Ging,- chair-
man of the Tenants’ Union, con-
cerning student representation in
Oakland Development Incorpor-
ated (ODI). The base of the con-
flict is a letter composed by the
Board to the Student Affairs Advi-
sory Committee (SAAC), bequest-
ing that SAAC endorse SG in its ef-
forts to seat five students on the
OD Board. At present, Frank Lit-
tle, past chairman of the Off-Cam-
pus Housing Office, sits on the
Board as liason from student ten-
ants.

SG President Tom Bailey said of
Little that he has “practically no
representation at all,” that he
“seems to back the community
more than the students.” In addi-
tion,. he pointed out that Little is
a graduate student in the School
of Law and that the Tenants’ Un-
ion is under SG which is an under-
graduate organization, rendering
Little's appointment to the posi-
tion invalid. Also, his appointment
was never approved by the Board.

Ging defended Little, citing his
past experience with student ten-
ants and the fact that the TU is al-
ready officially recognized by

‘ODI. He said, “It will take months
to get students on committee, so
why not let Little remain as _stu-
dent representative.” ‘

Board member Dave Bluey re-
.tored that “Little is blocking
other student participation in
ODI.” In conclusion, Bailey said,

_ “Frank Little will not sit repre-.
senting SG” and that a letter’

would be sent to the TU suggest-
ing that he, as a grad student, re-
sign from an undergraduate posi-
tion, as he is not functioning in
students’ interests. The debate
ended when Ging was denied the
floor. -

The Student Government Board
also voted to accept- and support
the policy of the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) of_the Univer-
sity concerning WP/PIRG’s re-
quest for an assessment on stu-
dent invoices as a source of funds.

The new SAC policy permits the
University to offer the use of its

mailing services, but without a
University letterhead. The offer
is based on a petition of more than
30 per cent of the students en-
dorsing the aims and objectives of
PIRG. The new policy extends the
same offer to any qualified, inter-
ested group which wishes to soli-
cit funds.

DAVE BLUEY, Board Member‘
Participation Blocked

Board member Bluey comment-
ed that “allowing PIRG to stuff
invoices would encourage other
campus orgahizations to make the
same request. It could really get
outof hand.” . 

A‘ proposal was made that bill-

ing codes be changedfor; student’

organizations as they are being
charged for many unauthorized
calls, supposedly being made by
former members of, the organiza-
tions who hap access to the num-
ber in past years. SG is having the
illegal calls traced in an attempt
to ascertain who made them.

" ‘ In "other business the Board re-
ceived and considered recommen-
dations‘ of the Allocations Com-
mittee for funding of 11 campus
organizations. The budgets of Pi
Delta Epsilon, the Pitt Karate
Club, the Chinese Language and
Cultural Association and Panhel-

lenic were accepted. Allocations‘

l.For Outstanding Service

for Students for a Democratic So-
ciety, Orchesis, Women’s Hous-
ing Board, the Pitt Rifle Club, and
the Pitt International Students Or-
ganization were tabled for one
week until members of the re-
spective organizations are in at-
tendance.

‘ Men’s Dorm Council (MDC),
represented by President Scott
Spadafore, objected to the cuts
made by the committee in its re-

_ quested budget. Allocations had

denied MDC’s request for three
cafeteria parties for next year.
After some discussion, the Board
decided to return the budget to
the committee to reconsider fund-
ing two cafeteria parties, one in
each term.

SG dictated that the parties
shall be open to all University
students, and not limited to dorm
residents. only. Spadafore also
proposed the need for an intra-
dormitory newsletter to promote
student
President Bailey favored, but the
Board defeated the suggestion. -

The budget submitted by Asso-
ciated Women Students (AWS)
was cut by the committee from
$13,000 to $3,000. Ellen Ganley,
present at the meeting to repre-
sent AWS displayed the need for
funds in programming for wom-
en at the University. Ganley cited
past programs of AWS, saying
they were “well-received and
well-attended, and should be con-

tinued.”

The Board voted to return the
budget to Allocations, suggesting
funding for proposed AWS pro-
grams, including Carly Simon in
concert, an Arts Festival, and the
traditional Lantern Night cere-
mony or some alternate initiation
program for freshman-i women,
which Allocations had cut.

The Board determined that pro-
grams of this sort are necessary
on campus to show students that
theactivities fee attached to each
academic invoice is used to their
benefit. A

The Allocations Committee re-
fused to consider a budget from

the Pitt Road Racing Team. SG -

has disavowed the Road Team for
fiscal mismanagement and will
refer them to the SG Judicial
Board for subsequent action.

,Medal Honors Director Emeritus

by LOIS ELDER

The University’s Chancellor’s
Medal was recently awarded to
Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, 83-
year-old director emeritus of the
Nationality Rooms Program.

Theaward, given for outstand-
ing and extensive service to the
University, was presented‘ by
Chancellor Posvar at a ceremony
in his office.

The Medal was created by the
'late Edward Litchfield when he
was Chancellor.
pients include Dr. Klaus Hofman,
a. Pitt professor who synthesized
ACTH; the George M. Bevier
family who funded the Bevier Li-
brary for Engineering students,
and Paul Benedum, ,newbhew ‘of

Previous reci-,

   
 

the late Michael Benedum. The
exact history of the Medal is not
known.

Attending the ceremony were
former Pittsburgh Mayor Joseph
Barr and other members of the
Board of Trustees, close friends
of Mrs. Mitchell, and office-hold-
ing members of the individual Na-
tionality Room Committees.

Many of the committee mem-
bers present worked with Mrs.
Mitchell in the 1920’s when she
served as an advisor to then-
Chancellor John G.‘ Bowman who
conceived the idea of the Cathe-
dral of Learning and the Nation-
ality Rooms.

At the ceremony, Dr. Posvar re-

ferred to the building of the ,

Rooms and said, “Many here to-
day made sacrifices, solved prob-
lems, and gathered in the Com-
mons Room for the dedication of
the Rooms which have here plant-
ed symbols of many heritages.”

After accepting the award, Mrs.
Mitchell spoke of the time when
the Nationality Rooms were be-
ing constructed. During those
years, many families in the Unit-
ed States consisted of immigrants.

“The philosophy at that time in
America was to forget the lan-
guage heard at home. speak only
English, and be a good American.
That idea didn‘t survive at the
University of Pittsburgh. Dr.
Bowman said to remember your

AIRB Set  To Tackle

Faculty Irresponsibili

by CHRIS CIEPLY

Charges of dereliction of re-
sponsibility on the part of faculty
will be handled in the future by the '
Academic Integrity Review Board
(AIRB) of the College of Arts and
Sciences, as stated at the Faculty
of Arts and 1 Sciences Council
meeting Friday. ,

The Council reaffirmed the
mandate of the AIRB to take
charge of allcases involving fac-
ulty irresponsibility. The man-
date followed a complaint by.
Richard Tobias, professor of Eng-
lish, that there was no body which '
had power to take action in such
cases. ’

Commenting on the Tobias state-
ment at the meeting, Jerome B.
Schneewind, Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences, cited in-
stances of faculty members being
absent from class without prior’
arrangement, turning in grades
late, scheduling examinations at
improper times, grading unfairly,
and having racist or sexist‘ bias
against some students. \

“There will be ‘more and more
students unwilling to put up ‘with
“In some cases

these are chronic offenders?‘
do this year in and year out.” . 

Dr. Schneewind recommen
to the council that/it "‘sp.ell’,‘o,__
matters of student charge;
against faculty with greater cla
ity ” 

The council discussed the’;
mation of organizations to '
with “offenders,” consideringyt
original suggestion by Dr. Tobi
that there be a self-policinggst
ture to do this. Most of the in
hers argued, however, that sit,

' the responsibility of AIRB

ulty irresponsibility.

. Jerome L. Rosenberg, Dea
the Faculty of Arts and Science,
finally called for the general ('2 "W

by W. M. SMITH
Entertainment Editor

About two weeks :ago I saw a
headline in the Pitt News which
read Miles Davis to Appear at Arts
Festival.

That was a misprint.

It wasn’t Miles but Nathan Da-_
vis who was scheduled to perform
and conduct the University of
Pittsburgh ‘Jazz Ensemble last

. Sunday.

Nathan Davis teaches Music 84

, at the University and his students

think he’s out-of-sight. ”
Nathan Davis is also a record-

' ing artist with his first album en- .

titled Makatuka on the local Se-
que label.

I heard Nathan’s‘ album and
liked it but I'd never been exposed
to a live Davis concert. By 8 'p.m.
Equitable Plaza was jammed with
folding chairs filled with people
wearing happy faces. -

I listened to the surreal sound
of the Pitt Jazz Band warming up
while watching Nathan move like
a proud shepard checking his
flock. He -tuned each section in-

dividually indicating whether they ,

were sharp or flat by a raising or
lowering of his hand.

Then .out came David Early,
who sings with the vocal section
of the Ensemble, to introduce the
first part of the concert. '

Their first two _ numbers were
entitled Bird and Miss Fine.

As I watched I marveled at how
these novice, young student/mu-
sicians worked within suchya tight

_ framework of intimacy.

Nathan worked them as one in-
strument and they responded im-

mediately to his dynamic direc-
tions.

Then it was the vocalists’ turn.
They" did two numbers. The first,
written by one of the members,
excelled in presentation but con-
tained a degree of lyrical redun-
dancy. Their second made use of
a lead female vocal who warbled
enough to shame a mockingbird

but when the rest of the group

joined in, all was forgotten.

The band came on again to do
three more numbers: Say It Soft-
ly, Little Darling, and Emancipa-
tion Blues. The excitement of a
big band filled the air and each
solo piece met with appreciative

applause.

Then they brought out Camille
Dalton whom I suppose is con-
sidered one of the group’s top vo-
calist. She did Alfie and all I can
say is, at least she knew all the
words.

The set closed with a version of
Stormy Monday which had the
whole plaza jumping and scream-
ing for more at its finish.

The next act on the bill was Deb-
by Seegal, a local folksinger/’ .
songwriter who should have stay-
ed home.

Perhaps it was just that a folk

Mrs. Mitchell also commented
on the Twelve Chinese Qualities
of a Gentleman, which include sin-
cerity and righteousness. They
are not only found on the chairs in
the Chinese Classroom but also
listed and framed in the Chancel-
lor’s office. ‘

“When you firstbecame Chan-
cellor, Dr.. Posvar, I peeked in
your window to see if you had re-
moved the list of the Qualities or
not.”

“You moved it a little more to
the left of the fireplace, but it’s
still in this office. It’s been hang-
ing in this room ever since Dr.
Bowman put it here when he was
chancellor.” '

When _Mrs.

Mitchell - retired

 

from the University in 1957, she
was named director emeritus of
the Nationality Room Program.

In her speech, she recognized
her newly named successor- as di-
rector of the program, Maxine
Bruhns, former executive ‘secre-
tary of Cultural and Educational
Exchange.

In The Dark

figure has fallen victim of a

be assassin, and once again indignant cries for gun con-
egislation are resounding through the hallowed hall-s of
I s. Surprisingly enough, the very congressmen who have

ineffective in ending the b_1oodbath in Viet Nam are
the sponsors of the bill which will supposedly curb vio-
eg 'inAmerica. ~ - n
he American‘Rif1e Association is serving as the principle
.. : pposing gun control. They believe that gun control legis-
" will serve only to deprive law abiding Americans of their
'-titutionalright to bear arms. ’ V
a criminal elements of our society will not be influenced
‘ legislation. Lets face it, murders, rapi/stsand robbers
;si _‘ ply not law abiding citizens. I

Once again a major political

he Lee Harvey Oswalds and Sirhan Sirhans of this world
likely to form a line to hand in their guns in compliance

o

e new legislation. -

rtherrnore, many American citizens enjoy hunting and
shooting and do not have the slightest intention of giving
lip r firearms. And so a large number of Americans would be
d.int0 “criminals.” ’_

Thegovernment has already shown its inability to cope

un controls by the failure of recent attempts to register
:i1"earms. Because guns are so easily stolen or bought on the

,market, gun registration programs have done nothing to
the rising crime rate. '

he only individuals who will have difficulties in obtaining
s‘- under the proposed legislation will be the law abiding citi-
who want guns for legitimate reasons-. And nothing short
ssive police searches could eliminate the massive arsen-
eapons which have been stockpiled in the homes of sports-
around the country.

learly some elements of society will benefit from gun con-

iminals and lunatics will encounter less opposition from
merican citizenry, black marketéers will be able to open
,, thriving business, the government will be able to create
‘bureaucracy and the police will have another excuse
‘g strongarm tactics and for making midnight searches
vate homes. . '
Butjhe idea that gun control can effectively limit crime in
la is ridiculous. It is just another campaign issue for
folks who brought you the Viet Nam War.

he United States needs many reforms,but another unen-
le law is not among them.

As with the crucial Kennedy-
Nixon debates in the presidential
campaign of 1960, the Humphrey-
MoGovern televised debates
scheduled for the two Sundays
before the June 6 California pri-
mary should be the deciding ‘fac-
tor in the 1972 Democratic race
to Miami.

Humphrey’s two-fold purpose
in challenging McGovern to the.
debates appears to be first of all
an attempt to indicate by com-
parison to the moderate Demo-
cratic voters some of the "radi-
\cal" positions of his opponent. Of
nearly equal importance should

be an effort-to demonstrate to the,

liberal wing of the party his sin-
cere friendship and respect for
the South Dakota senator, hoping

. through this device to reduce the

animosity of those who.abandon-
ed_ him in 1968 should he again
be nominated. , ‘

Unlike previous debates, how-
ever, the Sunday afternoon spots
that have been scheduled will
miss prime-time audiences, mak-
ing network editing of the ses-

sions for evening news programs

extremely important in present-
ing to the bulk of the electorate
both the form and substance of
the candidates’ appearances.

The weakest link in Senator
George McGovern’s chain of sup-

port labeled the "new Democratic-

center” continues to lie with min-
ority groups. With youth solidly
behind him and his appeal ‘in-
creasing among blue collar seg-
ments of the white population, he

has relied on Muskie-type tactics,

gaining the “big name” endorse-
ments of such figures as Cesar
Chavez and Mrs. Martin Luther
King, hoping to make inroads into
the black and Chicano vote. As-

Better Than

by STEVE LUBETSKY

George Wallace, an outspok-
— en opponent of gun control for

many years, experienced his first
adverse encounter with the lethal
weapon. when twenty-one year
old Arthur Bremmer wounded
him at a political rally two weeks
ago. Now it remains to be seen if
his misfortune will lead him to re-

- consider his stance.

Whether the Governor changes
his mind or hot, his fellow oppon-
ents of gun regulation will most
probably continue to adhere to
their principles. If they surren-
der their guns, they argue, they
will fall prey to would-be mur-
derers wholmay break into their
homes. '

Advocates of gu_n legislation
counter that seventy per cent of
all murders are not premeditat-
ed, but rather executed spontan-
eously. Furthermore, gun control
would facilitate political cam-
paigning, since would-be assas-
sins would have difficulty ob-
taining firearms. I

Although this-latter group pre-
sents a meritorious argument. one
aspect has been overlooked: that
IS, perhaps opponents of gun con-
trol continue their opposition sim-
ply because they haven’t been
offered an alternative to guns.
Maybe if shown an appropriate
substitute. they would consent
to relinquishing their priceless
weapons.

One possibility might be throw- ’

ing whipped-cream pies. Not only
could this be an effective sub-
stitute, but delicious and humorous

The aftermath of the senseless
shooting of Governor George C.
Wallace has led to painful recol-
lections of past assassinations of
other notable Americans, but lit-
tle has been said of one less re-
cent incident that bears great
similarity to the Wallace trage-

. dy_ .

Huey Long, governor and Sen-
ator fromLouisiana in the 1930’s,
a Southerner and populist in his
own right, was killed by an as-
sassin’s bullet at the height of

. his political career. Few have also
noted that of the last four shoot-
—.ings of well-known Americans,
three have occurred in the South.
>|< >l< ' *

All the talk of six months ago

concerning the ‘prevalence of

political apathy .on the nation’s-

campuses has been drowned out
by the infusion of renewed stu-
dent interest in the nominating
process, particularly evident in
the latter primaries.

Besides massive campaigning
efforts in primary states, students
have played a major role in non-
primary states, organizing caucus
efforts on local and statewide lev-

els. Young activists in Alaska came

close to running away with con-
trol of that state’s Democratic
party machinery at their recent
state convention.

* * * * :*

For perhaps the first time in
the struggle among the presiden-
tial contenders, a Gallup poll
has /concluded that George Mc-
Govern would stand up best
against Richard Nixon if the elec-
tion were held at the present
time.

Whipped Creain Battles  

when in a state or fury, perhaps
they would see how ridiculous

their behavior is and cease their
belligerence.

Another resort might be espe-
cially effective in campus de-
monstrations. Yiolent students,
who have often been known to
throw rocks at policemen, might
instead use water balloons which
are. much less dangerous. On the
other hand, police could retaliate
with water pistols, rather than tear
gas or mace, which could be fill-
ed with soap solution. ~

This could accomplish several
objectives: (1) the students would
release their anxiety towards the
police and the Establishment,
(2) the reaction of‘ the police
could force the demonstrators to
retreat thusterminating the hos-
tilities, (3) the usage of water
guns filled with ‘soap ‘solution

might give some of those dirty ’

long-haired hippies a bath.

Despite the advantages of these
aforementioned alternatives. it is
conceivable that sadistic people
may still prefer to maintain the
traditional gun. In‘ such cases, a
third option would be to use pel-
lets in place of bullets. However,
it still would be far more amus-

ing to see a politician get hit with .

a whipped cream pie than with
a fake bullet.

Obviously. disarming the na-

tion isn’t enough. The procedure '

should be extended to the rest
of the world." If people were
throwing whipped cream pies at
each ‘other instead of' shooting
we could ultimately eliminate
warefare and nuclear weapons.

The eight point spread (43 per
cent for Nixon to 35 per cent for
McGovern) still leaves him a
decided underdog, but his abili-
ty to pick up some of the Wal-
lace vote (15 per cent in this poll).
should a third party candidacy
on his part become an impossi-
bility. leaves the Democrats with
some measure of consolation.

Hidden behind the fanfare and
confusion of the presidential con-

test lies a potential change of‘

major proportions in the complex-
ion of the next Congress.

In districts across the country’

candidates like John Kerry, youth-
ful leader of the Vietnam Vet-
erans Against the War, are run-
ning for House seats, and James
Abourzek, outspoken liberal and an
offbeat Congressman from South
Dakota, is running for U. S. Sen-
ate in that state. I

A combination of fear of the
youth vote and appealing new
pension benefits have caused the
retirement of a number‘of’ old
regulars in the House, and the
‘result may be the largest, most
energetic class of freshman leg-
islators to come to Washington in
forty years. .

Letter to
the Editor

Dear Sirs:

I read with interest your issue -_

of May 23. While the people
around the campus are blasting
the undergraduate activities fee,
and PRIG fees, another insidious
fee may be creeping upon us
graduate students. I am speaking
about the proposed $5.00 a term
fee for the proposed Graduate-
Professional Student Association.

_On the whole I agree that the
goals of the GPSA are sound
since asvl see things, there is

._little contact between the grad-

‘uate student and the rest of the
university. Most of us are too
busy studying, working part-
time and taking care of our
families. However, I think that the
graduate-professionalsstudent is a
bit poorer than the average un-
dergraduate student. We have
to make a‘ll our money count -
there are no parents to pay the
bills, no ‘scholarships and fewer
fellowships— and under-payed
graduate assistantships.

I for one object to paying so
much‘ for whatl consider to be
not too much service, While
the goal are good, I think -that the
GPSA will have trouble keeping‘
up with promises. As I said be-
fore it_ is a struggle just to sur-
vive. _

If they want to charge something
why not something more rea-
sonable, and certainly not more
than the undergraduate activi-
ties fee. After all look at what
they get for such a small fee.

Sincerely,

Craig Prentiss

“Got a

ll  by BARBARA GERAUD
"spare” $5, a whole record store, and no idea"what to buy?

‘ llliiwell, here‘s some suggestions for easy (and some not-so-easy) listen-

ing possibilities on some current cha rt-toppers.

KENNY LOGGINS & MESSINA—SITTIN’ IN (Columbia)—The
-;;writer of "House at Pooh Corner” and an ex—Buffalo Springfield and
.fil?oco singer have gotten together for a swinging album. Slightly coun-
%'’try flavored, the songs tell of good and happy times. Best of these are

“To Make a Woman Feel Wanted,” “Country Song" and "Vahevella."
It’s a fun album to listen to or sing along with.

NEIL YOlJNG~HARVEST (Reprise)—After a "year and a half.
Young is back to prove he’s still the_most talented of‘ the firm of Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young. He uses everything from the London Symphony
to the Memphis Stray Gators to make a helluva album. Top tracks are

_ ‘-‘-Man Needs a Maid,” “Old Man,” and “Alabama.”

I THE ASSOCIATION—-WATERBEDS IN TRINIDAD (Columbia)-

- The "Cherish” bunch is still around seven years later. More mature

now, the music reflects the changes all must experience. Highlights

are "Kicking the Gang Around,” "Darlin’ Be Home Soon,’.’ and “Come

the Fall.” An interesting album, incorporating many different styles.

' -CAROLE KING—MUSIC (Ode)——Not nearly as good as Tapestry.

Her songs are all starting to sound the same, but if you like Carole
Kin , you’ll like the album. “Sweet Seasons” is the best song.

HE ADDRISIS BROTHERS—WE’VE GOT TO GET IT ON AGAIN

(Columbia(—They wrote “Never My Love” back in 1967'and have fin-

. all-y gotten their own album together. They sound like the Everly Broth-

_ _ ei‘s, but with a raunchier sound. The title song and “Wendy Wakefield"

\



‘ are the ones to listen to. ‘

RUSS GIGUERE—H-EXAGRAM 16—(Warner Brothers')—He’s
been around for a while, but just recently had this first solo album re-
leased, and it’s great. Everything from the lonesome cowboy “Ridge

' Rider” to the hard rock of "In New Germany” (a caustic political put-
down) and the fantastic‘ send-up of Motown in Randy Newman’s “Lov—
er’s Prayer.” It’s a highly enjoyable album, and has a song for every
mood. '

MOTHERS OF INVENTION—-JUST ANOTHER BAND FROM L.
A. (Bizarre)—Worth every penny to hear Frank Zappa and friends re-
gale us with the history of “Billy the Mountain,” with Ethel the Tree
growing out of his shoulder. I_t’s not quite up to the quality of the live
At the Fillmore album, but they’re not just another band.

. JUDEE SILL (Asylum)—E”x-junkie, ex-prostitute, ex-thief, Judee
Silws been there and back. This album shows it—they’re all her own
compositions and run the range of emotions—from “Jesus Was a Cross-
Maker” (produced by the ever-present Graham Nash), to “Lady-O”
and her own “Ridge Rider.” ,. . . She’s got a voice that’s a cross be-
tween Judy Collins and Rita Coolidge, and that ain’t bad at all.

JANIS JOPLIN—-IN CONCERT (Columbia)—I had high hopes for
this one, but was very disappointed. The tapes are ragged, and sound
quality ranges from fair to extremely poor. “Ball and Chain” is fairly
decent; so is “Ego Rock.” It’s not worth the money unless you’re a
real Joplin freak. ‘ .

M itters

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
- Associate Sports Editor

In a recent meeting with Ath-
letic Director Casimir Myslinski-,
Pitt's head baseball coach Bob
Lewis was given the OK to extend
mitt action to include fall baseball.

“We’ll -finally be going in the
fall,” explained Lewis who has al-
ways been an advocate of contin-

uing to play baseball during au-
.tumn. .

The Panther mentor is confi-I
dent that the additional workout
in the fall will be of extreme im-
portance in bolstering the base-
ball program at Pitt.

“Playing fall baseball will be of
immeasurable help to us in pick-
ing who will be on the team in the
spring,” related Lewis.

«‘‘During the spring‘ I have 70
people to cut in a three week'per—
iod. But if we play a fall schedule
or just play intrasquad games in
the fall, I’ll be able to see earlier
what the guys can do‘.

 LEIS
\Makes Pitch for Fall . [2

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor .

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.——"It"’ is
a big word in everyone’s life, a
big word in an athletes life.

If Willis Reed had played for
the Knickerbockers, if the Pirates
had gotten that clutch hit, if Bob
Medwid hadn’t gotten hurt, the
outcomes could have been differ-
ent.

Likewise, Jim Banner’s track
team could have concievably won
the 96th annual IC4A outdoor
track and field championships at
Franklin Field, in Philadelphia,
last weekend, if.

As it turned out, the tracksters
scored 25 points (same as last
year) on their way to a third place
finish—their best outdoor per-
formance in the IC4A’s.

Undoubtedly, if Ted Bobby
wouldn’t have lost his timing by
knocking~down a hurdle in the 440

«intermediate hurdles event, then

he could have placed. If Roosevelt
Randall had a healthy back, then
he could have placed in the triple
jump. 0 -

If either Rick Caroselli,
Harris, or Bill Ka_lchhalter could
have qualified for the 120 yard
high hurdels. and Tim Riley qual-

At, Bat Fall 

“Then if I can have only about
30 people trying out in the spring,
I can give them a fair chance to
show what they can do.” '

Eliminating some of the num-
erous players attempting to make
the ranks as a Panther mitter as

early as thefall is not to their dis- .

advantage. For, as Lewis pointed
out," “most of the guys are in
shape from playing baseball all
summer long.’’y ,

The definite fate of baseball in

the fa1l‘is, however, still unde-
cided at this point.

Myslinski has not determined
whether the Panthers will play in-
tercollegiate :ball or just have in-
trasquad practice.

“Mr. Myslinski_ wants specta-
tor sports for the students in the
fall,” said Lewis. “It seems that
he would rather we played other
schools in the area instead of just
practicing. -‘

“Although Mr. .Mys1inski was a
little indefinite, I think he plans to
put fall baseball, on the same bud-
get as spring baseball.”

This means that any funds used
to finance fall games will be taken

from money budgeted for spring I

mitt action.
“I don’t want to do that,” stat-

.ed Lewis, regarding the single

budget proposal. “I‘don’t want to
schedule "eight games in the fall
because that will only allow me to
schedule about 18 games for the
spring.

"It would be ridiculous to play

12-18 games in the spring because ‘

some of those games are bound to
be cancelled on account of rain
and that cuts your schedule down
even more. .

“I know of schools now who
would play us in the fall——schools
like Indiana, Steubenville, Point
Park, Duquesne, and Frostburg.
But ‘schools like Clarion, West
Virginia, Penn State, and Gettys-

burg will only play around their
area. They won’t travel out here
in the fall, just in the spring.”

Faced with this situation Lewis
commented, “If they give us mon-
ey we’ll schedule games in the
fall. If we don’t get money we’ll
just practice.”

Whether the Panther mitters
just practice or play intercollegi-
ate games in the fall, they will be
displacing the soccer team from"
the Trees Hall Field.

\

This condition will probably be
resolved by either having the boot-
ers practice in the field_beyond
Trees Hall Field or under. the
newly acquired lights at Pitt
Stadium. « "-

Either way, Lewis and his mit- "

ters will be taking the field this
fall.

would have been more abundant
for Pitt.

If Ken Silay (880), Dorel Watley
(440) would have been up to par,
they could have scored. If the
mile relay team, who had'the
third fastest qualifying time,
wouldn’t have been stuck in the
eighth.lane they might have won.

Again, if, if, if.

As the sunny Philadelphian Sat-
urday afternoon took its course.
the many Pitt ifs began turning
into dissappointing buts.

Pennsylvania University, who
had -been the favorite, got into
position for their romp by qualify-
ing I4 athletes for Saturday’s fin-

After the first day of action,
Pitt found itself with a solid hold
on third place and a dark horse in

the meet. Pitt accumulated 10,

points. Penn State led with 13 and
Penn showed 12.

“I only expected eight points at

this time,” Banner said early Sat-’

urday morning. “Penn and Penn
State have excellent chances and
we still have an outside chance.

“We have a good chance to fin-
ish in the top three.”

Banner’s prediction blossomed, .

as Pitt edged out Villanova by two
points. As a result, the Banner-
man received a bronze trophy for
their efforts-—the_ first outdoors.

Penn eventually won the meet
with a’ 53 point total. Penn State
was runnerup with 40 and the rest

of the 62 schools backed the

four Pennsylvania entries.

Bill Rea again did his job bet-
ter than any other Panther. Rea
won both the long (25’1”) and the
triple (50’8%”) jumps.

points. Dorel Watley photo-finish-

chor leg in the mile relay (three_

points). Mike Schurko did the job
in the steeplechase (two points),
and Steve Hein’s second in the dis-
cus (four points) totaled the Pitt
scoring. '

Hum In Munich A

IlllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllé

by MARTY HELLMAN
There is one first year medical

student at Pitt that isn’-t waiting .

until he graduates until he starts
thinking about gold. —

Dick Rydze, a native of nearby
Mt. Lebanon and- presently com-
pleting his first year at Med
School, is one of the United States’
prime candidates for an Olympic
medal in platform diving late this
summer in Munich, Germany.

‘Before entering Pitt’s Medical

School, Rydze starred for the Uni-  I

versity of Michigan’s swim team
as an undergraduate.

In the past four years, he has
won an amazing total of seven na-
tional Amateur Athletic Union
(AAU). platform diving titles -
three indoor and four outdoor. Ad-
ditionally, he snared the silver
medal at the Pan American
games in Cali, Columbia.

Ten meter platform diving is
not a competitive event in NCAA
action; Only the one meter and
three meter events are part of col-
legiate competition. Dick attained
thirds in both events’ nationally
even though they aren’t his spe-
cialty. ‘

Prior to making the U.S. teams,
Dick will have to qualify in July at
the, national Olympic trials in
July, but he anticipates no prob-
lem at the trials in Long Beach.

“I’m confident that I’ll make ’

it,” states the blond-haired,
slightly stocky Rydze. “I have
consistently been in the top three
for the past four years.”

But Rydze knows that the real
‘test will be the Olympic games.
He cites two-time gold medal win-
ner Klaus Dibiasi of Italy as “the
man to beat.”

Backing up Dibiasi is hisfellow

countryman Georgio Cognetto. Al- _

though Dick has lost to both of
them at times in international
competition, he has also beaten
both on other occasions.

But the two Italians rate Rydze
as the prime diver this year. The
two were quoted in an Italian
news paper as saying that Rydze
is the man to beat. -

Rydze became interested in div-
ing at the age of nine while on
vacation with his parents in Flori-
da. “They wanted to get me out of
their hair so they had me take a
few diving lessons,” he laughed.

Once Rydze showed an interest
in the sport, his parents took in-
terest in his career, though‘ they
never pushed him into it. “With-
out. them, I wouldn’t be diving
now.” _ .

After gaining much experience‘
in age group competition in the
area, Rydze sharpened his diving
skills under the coaching of Will
Saunders, the Mt. Lebanon coach.

A‘. two-time high school state
champion in one-meter diving,
Rydze was offered college.schol-
arships by many schools, but he
chose Michigan which had accord-

 

The Pitt road racing team, hav-
ing recently rebuilt the suspen-
sion system in the Javelin, is slat-
ed to compete in the Une 3-4 Mid-
Ohio Trans-Am sedan race.

The event is a 192 mile
chase over the challenging Mid-
Ohio Sports Car Course, located
near Lexington, Ohio. It carries
a purse of $24,000 and is the only
paying race on Pitt’s schedule.

Javelin, will meet the toughest

ing to Rydze, “The best tower"

- coach in the country in Dick Kim-‘

ball.1’
Kimball runs a diving school in

Florida during the summer and

between there and school, Rydze
perfected his diving. ‘

Due to his increased studying
time this past year, Rydze has
been forced to curtail his practic-
ing from three hours a day to
five hours a week. Though he
doesn’t enjoy the privilege of a
diving coach at the present,'he

has been receiving help from lo-
cal divers, notably John Hahnfeld
who hopes to be an Olympic div-
er himself.

Though modest about all of his
past accomplishments, he found
it hardto criticize his own diving
ability and only" after much
thought, chose his entry as being
the weakest part of his ability.

“My favorite dive is a forward
one and a half twist. I was the
first person to ever perform a
back two and one half in the pike
position in competition although
~another diver does it now.”
Diving is not an exact scoring
sport, just as medicine is not an
exact science. Rydze is fully

’ aware of the great implications

of the judges and their opinions
in regards to the outcome of‘ inter-
national diving competition.

“U.S. judges use different tech-
niques than other judges-t_hey
rely more on takeoff and form
than entry, while international.
judges care more for entries. "

“Since humans are judging,
there is a lot of bias in it—they
can doanything they want to-de-
cide the outcome-. ”

Wearing a Munich ’72 tee-shirt
Rydze" knows that he has the
chance to win it all this summer.
“This i it; it doesn’
anyone else but me.”

IC4A’s Lack  Usual

by PAN FANARITIS

Although the IC4A’s were held
at Franklin Field like the Penn
Relays and the Martin Luther
King Games, the difference in the
excitement generated by the for-

.mer meet and the latter meets
was comparable to the difference

ih the boxing abilities of Ron Stan-
der and Joe Frazier.

The obvious question is whv.
Basically, there were three rea-
sons. .

First of all, there were no gla-
mour runners this year. This is
not to say that Bill Rea, Greg
Fredricks, Chris Dunn, and Tom
Blair are not competitors of na-
tional calibre. ‘

They do not; however, have the
charisma of a Marty Liquori.

Secondly, many top athletes
chose to skip the meet. Adelphi
with is nationally ranked mile re-
lay and stable of printers; Den-
nis Walker, Ray Lee, Clyde Mc-
Phereson, Keith Davis, and Lar-
ry Ross, decided to compete in
the NCAA Small College Cham-
pionships at Ashland, Ohio.

Also, excellent performers such
as Duke’s Bob Wheeler, a 3:58

tory team Javelin, under" the name
of Roy Woods Racing, and Tope is
the defending National Champion
in Class A Sedan. ‘

Fryer set a class record at the
Mid-Ohio plant back in 1967, driv-
ing a Corvette. He drove the Pitt
machine in two Trans-Am races
last year and consistently ran
with the leaders. However, engine
failures endedhis bids on both oc-
casions. .

Tlopping’ Excitement

1500 meters, and Joe Lucas of
Georgetown, one of theytop stee-
plechasers in the nation, elected
to rest for the Nationals.

Lucas explains his reasoning,
“I was undecided about running."
Then I found out that there would
be only one heat in the steeple-
xchase instead of two. ‘

“With 18 runners the race would
have been too crowded. I 'can’t
take a chance ongetting hurt\with
the NCAA’_s and the ‘Olympic
trials coming up.”

When asked if it was a tough de- .

. cision, the Moya ‘star said, "Well,

I’m defending champ and it would
be nice to repeat. Also, I’m sure
I could get the record. However,‘
you’ve got to sacrifice smaller
goals sometimes in order to reach
larger ones.”

In last year’s meet, seven teams
were within 11. Phints of each
other. This season it seemed as if
the competition was a dual meet
between Penn State and Penn.

Thus, despite the fact that the
meet did have some fine perform-1
ers and performances, Franklin‘
Field was not "hopping” as it
usually does for track meets. The
excitement just wasn’t there.

MONTREAL (AP)-Tim Foli‘s
run-scoring single in the sixth inn-
ing snapped a tie and gave the
Montreal Expos a 3-2 victory over
the Pittsburgh Pirates Wednes-
day night.

Fo1i’s hit drove in Ken Single-

ton from second base after Sin-
gleton and Terry Humphrey had
cracked one-out singles.

The Pirates took a 1-0 lead in
the second inning when Richie
Hebner walked, Milt May singled
and losing pitcher Nelson Briles,
3-2, hit a sacrifice fly to right to
score Hebner.

Montreal tied the score in its
half of the inning when Ron Fairly
lined his fourth home run of the
season over the right field fence.

Willie Stargell’s 10th homer of
the year restored Pittsburgh’s
lead, 2-1, in the top of the third.
Montreal evened the score in the
bottom of the third on singles by
Ron Hung and Boots Day, a throw-
ing error by Hebner and Bob Bail-
ey’s sacrifice fly which marked
Bailey’s 500-major league RBI.

Winning pitcher Ernie McAnal—

ly posted his first victory of the
season after five consecutive de-
feats.

The gameat Philadelphia be-
tween the Phillies and Mets was
rained out, leaving the Pirates 41/2
games behind the front running
New York club in the National
League’s Eastern Division.
