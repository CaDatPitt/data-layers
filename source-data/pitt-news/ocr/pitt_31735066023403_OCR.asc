Student Government Presidential Candidates Debate Issues’,

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Bill Abraham, and Kim Watter-
son, the two candidates for Student
Government Board Presidentwere
given one last chance to rehash
campaign issues concerning al-
locations, better student represent-
ation and the possible violation of a
potential 0 presidential candidate’s
rights before the . election, at a
debate ’ staged? yesterday in the
Student Union Lower Lounge.

The candidates began by .art-
iculating what they believed to be.

/the basic philosophy of student

government in serving students.
“Student Government makes the

mistake too‘ often dealing with

problems that are internal. to
student organizations, ’ ’ Abraham 1’
said. “It would be the role of
Student Government to formulate
their own,,ideas and lead student
organizations through the channels

’ of’ solving their own 0 problems,

Inthe past student government has
gone on egotistical tangents and
gotten a lot of publicity while not
accomplishing what they set out to
do”. . I

“I agree that student govern-

ment should lead the organizations

Asbestos Treatment  

By JANET MENOSKY ‘

Pitt News Staff Writer ,

- Students who use the facilities at
Trees Hall can be assured that they
are safe from the effects of
asbestos following the
single asbestos treatment in the
United States which was conducted
this summer. 1

i The university at one point had
asbestos sprayed on the ceilings of
Trees Hall.

ﬂakes or is knocked off ceilings.
Small particles of this substance
can enter a person’s respiratory
system and are known ‘to cause
cancer.

There ‘~ were two different
methods of alleviating the situat-
ion. g In the gymnasiums, the
asbestos. was removed and a
coating of a cellulose base material,
K-13, was applied.‘ In the pool and

studio, K-13 was applied directly _‘

over the asbestos.

“The level of asbestosiin the air

' at the pool and studio did not

constitute removal,” said Van
Conklin, Director of Plant Services
and Building Maintenance at Pitt.

The testing for asbestos, done by
Materials Consultants and Labora-
tories Inc., revealed that there was
also asbestos in the Graduate

School of Public Health Building,

Hillman Library, Langley Hall
Lobby and the Litchﬁeld Towers
Cafeterias and Tower C. Lobby. '

‘ By ‘PATTI LANGFORD -

Pitt News Staff Writer
' This is  of a ten part series in
which we will be taking a year by

 year look at some of the

fundamental characteristics and
changes here at Pitt during the last
ten years.

‘Like most college and university

campuses during the late 1960’s..

and early 1970’s, the Pitt campus of

,the fall of 1969 was characterized
by an attitude of rebellionv and
dissatisfaction. among the student
body. Students opposed and
questioned everything from the
Vietnam War to the Women’s
Rights movement.

According‘ to Lou McLinden,
Associate Director of Student
Activities, “They (the students)
were activists.” But he added, “I
sort of enjoyed being challenged
day by day.”

__ May 4,1968 Allison Krause was killed by NatlonaI'Guardsiiien at Kent State

   
 

Most of the major issues of the
1969-1970 school year «uphold this
image of political activism.

Discrepancy over the grading
system, for instance, was one of the
major sore spots of the 1969 fall
term.

Students . claimed that grades
alienated them from the teachers,
and that they were also used to
screen out black students to decide
who would go to Vietnam.

‘Unfortunately, not much had

‘been done in the way of revising

the grading system by the winter
term of 1970. The satisfactory/un -
satisfactory grading scale had been
implemented for all university
students, but for credit accumula-
tion only.

Another major issue during the
1969-1970 school" year was the
Black Rights ‘Movement;

After the 1968' racial riots,

     
 

University. Her father (above) fought for years in court seeking ‘justice’ In his

 

enrollment of black students went
from six hundred to nearly one
thousand. With the formation of
the BAS (Black Action Society) and
its subsequent “sit in” at the
computer center many of the
demands made by black students
were met.

Black faculty members,‘ admin-
istrators and personnel were
recruited, a black literature collect-
ion was set up in Hillman Library"
and a Black Studies Department
was established.

Monday, Sept. 15, 1969 was
designated Black Monday. On this
day Pitt students joined in a march
downtown to support the Black
Coalition in its negotiations with
construction union people for
employment for blacks.

Over two hundred students and
faculty members signed a petition
addressed to Chancellor Posvar
demanding suspension of all

luniversity‘ construction. Posvar

issued a‘ statement more or less
yielding to the demand. '

The political activism of Pitt
students showed itself again in
their demonstrations against the
Vietnam War. In an effort to gain
local support for November's
“March on Washington,” the first

Moratorium program of the fall '

1969 was held October 15.

The Moratorium was kicked off

by the planting of memorial crosses '

on the Cathedral Lawn in com-

memoration of the men who had

died in Vietnam. . In addition,-
professors cancelled classes so that

students could attend the day-long

rallies and memorial services.

, For the most part the Morator-
ium activities were peaceful,
although some arrests and physical
assaults by the police were

LookingBcick zlrncigesof Pitt Through the l.cisi Decade

LOU MCLINDEN

The climax of the Moratorium
program was the ‘jMarch Against
Death,” held in Washington, D.C.

President Richard Nixon refused to .

recognize the protests of those
attending the Moratorium.

In addition to their stand on
national problems, Pitt students
also challenged issues here. at the
university.

The security problems the,

‘University now faces were no less
important in the fall of 1969.

In September of 1969 a number
of ‘Pitt students were assaulted by
non-students which led to a general
outcry among Pitt residents for
increased security. .

students came to the conclusion
that_ one of the major problems‘ of
security" was a general lack of

backing by the administration for

individual officers.

To alleviate this problem, stu-
dents suggested that all doors into
the Tower lobby, with the
exception _,of_ the main one, should
be secured after a certain time in
the evening. Students would be
required to show identification to
be allowed - entrance into the
dorms.

As we now know, through the

"events of last January, even that

amount of security is not re-
assuring.

The 1969-1970 school year also
saw some changes in housing.

Watterson said.

The candidates have differing
views on what the fate of the
allocations » process should be.

Student Government Board
president Stan Galanski addressed
the question to Abraham and
Watterson concerning what their
three priorities if elected would be.

Abraham listed his priorities as
being:

—Bringing some element of
credibility to the board, equality he
believes is lacking in the present
board. .

—Alternating meeting places to
various locations on campus to
include the_ residence halls.

——Increasing communication and
visibility of Student Government,
letting stu/dents behind them to get

The Pitt News
Endorsements I

This year’s Student Government Board election,

like most elections in the past, presents its own
unidue set of problems for those students interested
enough t6 vote. ' P

, Students will choose nine elected representatives
rather than seven, as a result of a change in the SGB,

Because only thirteen people are .

_ "running for the board and the presidency, students

rhave'a small field to choose from. It is unfortunate

-/that a student body the .size of P_itt’s can produce
‘ such a small group of individualsto represent 12,000

people. e V
Compounding the problem, most of the candidates
have little or no experience in student government,

' some possessing no knowledge of its working before e

* the election began.

Keeping this in mind, the Pitt News sifted through
the candidates credentials and platforms, examining
each one for some sign of capability needed to carry
out the reponsibilities of a student representative.

‘Based on our deliverations, the Pitt News

endorsements are:
President: Bill Abraham
Board: Martin Bertocchi
Walter Burke
Bernadette Herward
In the presidential race, we chose Abraham over
Kim Watterson because he can provide,/a fresh, new

approach to running the Student Government

Board. Abrahams sincerity and enthusiasm for the
job can offset his youthfulness and lack of experience
in student government. ’
We only suggest that Abraham quickly overcomes
hisabhorr-ance for politics. The SGB president must

be a politician to survive the rigors of the job and the .

pressures of dealing with an uncooperative university
administration. , .

We had originally planned to endorse four board
candidates‘, but the size of the field andthe lack of
variation in the candidates platforms provided us
withlittle choice but to endorse three.

--Be’rtocchi is by far the most qualified candidate in
our view. -His work as a lobbyist on the SGB’s Public

Page 6—Friday, November 9, 1979

and Governmental Relations committee has proven
that he is a. hardworking, articulate individual.
His experience with PGR should provide him with
the leadership an inexperienced board needs.

Burke is probably the most unique candidate in
this election. He is’ thirty years old and on leave of
absence from his job as a railway clerk. His age
should provide the board with the maturity it has
lacked in the past. His field of study, labor relations,
will enable Burke to handle the job of negotiating
with the university administration.

53/.

Herward, currently chairperson -of the SGBAR-,

commuter committee, ,will provide commuters with a
strong voice on the board. The commuter
population, which represents the majority of -Pitt’s
undergraduate student body, has been grossly
neglected in the past. Herward should change this
tre‘r1d~if she is elected. .

In the past, students have shown little interest in
the Student Government Board elections.. We only
hope that this trend is reversed this year. , ,

Students complain every year that they have little
input into the operation of the university, and rightly
so. However, this election is their opportunity to use
what little voice they have inhow Pitt affects their
lives. We hope that students overcome their apathy
and vote next week. . l ‘

5 Terrible Choice of Kennedy and Carter Not Worth Voting For,

Earlier today I read the article
entitled “77% of Pitt students
choose Kennedy over Carter”
which appeared in The Pitt News.

‘My question is this: Why must
Kennedy and Carter be the only
two choices? If I were given such a
terrible choice next November, I
believe that I would refuse to vote
at all. One look at the past perfor-
mance of these two men will give
us an idea of what they have to

' offerfor our future.

On one hand, we have President
Carter who rode the‘ wave of anti-
p establishmentism into office by

-promising to cut

budget, decrease" inﬂation and
unemployment, restore conﬁdence
in the American government,
/maintain American prestige over-
seas and to put two cars in, every
garage and a chicken in every potl
Not only has he failed to do any of
these things; but also, on every
occasion when United States’
interests were challenged on
foreign shores, he has backed down
on our commitments and slinked
On the home front he has
offered us the same old solutions,
for the same old problems, with the
same old results.

However, on the other hand, we
are said to have an alternative in
Senator Edward Kennedy. What
an altemativel l l
we have a do nothing, inept
President, Kennedy offers to do
everything for everyone—-—social-

ized medicine, omnipotent unions,.
increased government spending for ,

redistribution programs, etc....
And yet he still contends that such
programs will reduce unemploy-
ment and inﬂation in America
today. Does he not realize that
Americans are beginning to under-,
stand that these liberal, high cost

programs do not work? Kennedy is .

still living in the days of his
brother's “New Frontier” which
has been out of style since the early
70’s. He certainly must realize by
now that his liberal, free spending
attitude is responsible for most of
the economic problems of the
nation today. Yet he still feels he
can pull the wool over our eyes one
more time in another election ‘filled
with rhetoric and promises which
will be broken.

Give me the choice of Carter and
Kennedy and I would vote for
neither. Somewhere there has to
be someone with fresh ideas to
solve our important problems. If he
is out there we can only hope that

Cafeteria  
Complaints

I am a student here at Pitt. I also

.work 15 hours a week as a line

server in the student cafeteria.
Recently, there have been com-
plaints registered against the fcfod
service. I, being a student and a
cafeteria worker, am aware of the
feelings on both sides. -With this
letter I want to describe the side
of the workers.

Tonight, a dishwasher deeply cut
his hand on a glass because some
students deliberately sawed a glass
an put it on the tray. This has
happened before. i Some students
take butter and throw it up on the
ceilings or smash it .on the tables.
Some students deliberately break
salt and pepper shakers. Some
students prefer to smash cake on
the tables. Some students write in
ink on the tables. Some students
turn ice cream upside-down on the
re.‘ -2-;-5. Some students take excess

Some students leave bowls and
dishes on the edges of places where
they are bound to fall off and break.

Some students break glasses full of‘

milk and sit them on tables so a
worker cannot tell the" glass is
broken until she tries to pick it up.

This letter could go on. I could
go on and describe the incredible

amount of food that is wasted each ,

day. The waste is the reason we

are not allowed to give two portions,

of meat at one time. I can think of a
civilization starving to death in
Cambodia, or people in India, or in
Nicaragua. But I do not want to
sound too bitter.

I have said only some students
because all students do not act in
such ways. Some students are
actually mature, responsible
people who behave like adults and
not like they are in grade school.
Some students have a right to

complain if they are dissatisfied
However‘

with the food service.
some students should not even be
allowed in the cafeteria. A worker
was hurt tonight, and it is not /the
first time this has happened due to
a student. "I want to conclude that
the next time you make a complaint
about the‘ food service, first ask
yourself honestly, if you deserve
such a privilege.

and scoring. The responsibility to
win games does not lie solely with
the offensive unit, but no team can
expect to win games without
scoring goals.

WVU’s ﬁrst score came with four
minutes remaining in the first half
on a throw-in pass to the
Mountaineers’ Munir Shalhouto.
Shalhouto took the pass and sent a
blooper over the outstretched arms
of Pitt goalie‘ Mark Robertson.

The second half began with
defensive problems for the Pan-
thers. The Panthers had been
playing without the services of ace
fullback Tom -Kunkel until the
Mountaineer contest. But just as

next year.

obviously has the better team, and
the. Panthers are more physical
than the Mountaineers. WVU has
always had players with great
ability at the skilled positions, and
this year is no_ exception.
Sophomore quarterback Oliver
Luck has accounted for 1478 total
yards this year, while halfback

. Robert Alexander has rushed for

Cleveland that helped the Browns

rally for two touchdowns inside the

last four minutes to win 24-19.
The irony of this is that the 5-

sixth-round draft picks by Phila-_

delphia in 1977, has not been a
butterﬁnger ball carrier.

Before he started his current
epidemic against the Cardinals he
lost the ball only three times in 166
carries.

Eagles coach Dick Vermeil
insists that he’s not worried about
Montgomery’s sudden case of
fumbleitis. After all, here’s a back
who has gained 951 yards and
scored 54 points. He's the
triggerman of the Eagles’ offense.

In fact, Montgomery means
more to the Eagles’ offense than
Tony Dorsett does to /Dallas.

  Siriano, Bailey, Head East with Lehigh Hopes tor NCAA’s    

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Two members of the cross-

country team will have the_

opportunity this weekend to qualify
for the NCAA Nationals, to be held

- next week at‘ Lehigh University.

Senior Gary Siriano and junior
Randy _Bailey will leave today in
preparation for the 10,000 meter
run to be held Saturday morning on
that same Lehigh course. 7 .
Coach Mike Agostinella believes
both runners are in the best shape

of their lives as they go into this
NCAA Eastern Regional Qualifying
meet.

“Both Gary and Randy are in the
ﬁnest -shape that they have ever
been in,” said Agostinella.
“They have both recently’ set
personal records on our course this
year when they ran against Kent
State. A v

Those records set by Siriano
(31:30) and Bailey (32:18) were set
on the very difficult Schenley Park
course. At one time, this course

was rated seventh toughest in the
world.

The qualifying race on Saturday
will field approximately 250
runners. The Division 11 qualiﬁer
will take in all Eastern colleges as
far south as Virginia. According to
Agostinella, three of the toughest
competitors in the meet will come
from llillanova and Penn State.

“Sidney Maree and Amos Korir
from Villanova and Larry Mangan
from Penn State are going to be
three of the top runners going for

the individual title, along with
Gary,” said Agostinella. “There
will also be a team title at stake and
Villanova will have a good shot at
winning that too.”

Both Siriano and Bailey could
qualify for the national running
next week, but Siriano has a better
chance because of his experience in
running major trackqlong distance
races. Last year Siriano missed

qualifying for the‘ nationals by one .

place in this meet.

In this race, the top four teams
qualify for the nationals and then
six other individuals are chosen to
go on to the nationals. Siriano
placed seventh. This year though,
with a Penn Relays victory to his

credit from last spring in the 50,000 .

meter run Siriano will have an
excellent chance tomorrow.

‘ ‘Gary is the more experienced of
the two,” said Agostinella, “be-
cause of the fact that he has
competed in and won some major

\

think that he has a great shot ‘at '

qualifying.”
Siriano, too, feels optimistic. A

“I’m very optimistic about my ‘  A}
chance to qualify this year because.

I feel a lot stronger than I did last
year,” said Siriano.

‘ ‘I'm enthused aboutthe chances

“I am happy to be able to get the ‘

DC. Pitt upset two nationally-,ranked teams in the process,

 hear of the- feats of Dan
Marino, of -V the Big Mac (Randy

!ar.e."t_he. players who get the most
ink because they put the ball across
‘the goal-line.’
7 ’.‘Yet,every football fan knows, or

offensive line is essential to every

no different "at Pitt.’

some "early season trouble, has
fjelled into a solid unit which week
}in and week out has delivered
_-“performances deserving more pub-
~slicity~., The leader of this line is Dan
}-Fidler‘, the steady left guard.
 "Fidler, a senior from Scottsdale,
" ; ‘Arizona and a. Junior College
,‘a.ll-‘Ammerica, came‘ to Pitt in what
the described as an accident.

 “Pitt was recruiting our tight

college to major college. However,
as he pointed out, he had. some
doubts.

“It was a lotbigger jump than I
expected,” Fidler said. “When I
came here I saw defenses I never

is not extremely big and it is .a
credit to his determination that he
has come this far.

Early in the season, the offensive
line was.not blowing people out

~ with the authority.that it is now,

and Fidler attributed this problem
to the different offense installed
this year. .

“Last year we mostly zone-
blocked because of the veer offense
and, in that case, we didn't have to

. hold our blocks for too long,” said

Fidler. “But now we run a

pro-type offense, and that gave us

trouble early in ‘the year. But
we've adjusted.”

Fidler, who has been playing

. guard since seventh grade, credit-
ed his success to quickness and

anticipation. When asked to ‘assess
himself as a player, Fidler replied,

v “I don’t-make-too many mistakes-

I’ve played the position for so long,
and.. I feel I can anticipate a
defensive player's move before he
makes it and cut him 0 .”

Fidler runs a 4.7 in the 40-yard

dash, a fast time for an offensive

guard.
The offense ﬁnally seems to be
coming into its own, largely

because of the improved play of the A

offensive line. Fidler, ever the
perfectionist, still thinks there is
room for improvement.

“I feel we can run-block a lot
better,” Fidler said. “We haven't
been able to move the ball too well
on the ground, and we should «be. I
don’t know what the problem is,
but we should ‘start establishing
more of a running game.”

Fidler, a soft-spoken person who
plays with quiet confidence,
realizes the importance of _ the
upcoming game with’ WVU.

“lt’s a big rivalry, and-we know -

we're in for a ball game. We know
we have to win and we'll go out
there and do a job. We’ll have to
be prepared, but the plain fact is
that we have to win, or we won’t go
to a bowl game,” said Fidler:
Players have bad days and good
days, but Dan Fidler ‘ gives his
usual steady performance every

v day". Fidler, a physical/education

major, someday hopes to get into
coaching. If his playing ability is
in any way indicative of his
coaching ability, Dan Fidler will be

a winner. -
