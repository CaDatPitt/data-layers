Twenty-three pledge ribbons

After a week of silence, continuing
from last Sunday until Saturday at

noon, the women of the Greek socie-

Hudnut Reviews
Social Conditions

In USSR Today

Dr. Herbert B. Hudnut, pastor of
the Bellevue Presbyterian Church,
will give his impressions of “Social
Conditions in the U. S. S. R.” at to-
day’s meeting of Inquiry Forum, be-
ginning at 12:30 o’clo-ck in Room 107,
Alumni Hall.

Dr. Hudnut’s observations on the
social aspects of the Soviet Union
will be based on his extensive travels
this summer. He has just recently
returned from Europe, where he de-
voted most of his time to a study of
Russian conditions as they are today.
Among the subjects to be discussed
by the speaker will be a comparative
evaluation of situations in several of
the mass movement countries.

For two years, from 1933-1935,
Dr. Hudnut served as president of
the board of trustees of the Chil-
dren’s Service Bureau of Pittsburgh.
Prior to that he was a member of
the Board of National Missions of
the Presbyterian Church.

Before coming to Bellevue, he held
pastorates in Dallas, Texas, and Cleve-

 

land, Ohio. He has been at his pres-
ent post since 1932.
Following Dr. Hudnut’s speech,

which will last approximately half an
hour, there will be a 15-minute open
forum period.

By Shorty Long

As you can see (don't look now!)
we are temporarily deserting the
sports page to take up the cudgels
and the puns for “The First Mrs.
Fraser,” Pitt Players, and the First
Mr. Cass. As we are mascot of that
super-special organization, the least
we can do besides collect properties
and sew on costumes is write a little
story.

Gentry Orchestra
Brings ‘S wanee
Swing’ To Dance

 

Freshman Dance Will Have
Music Of Noted Band
As Main Attraction

 

Tom Gentry and his Ambassadors,
one of the leading dance bands of
the country, have been signed to fur-
nish the swing music for the annual
Freshman Dance to be held December
4 at the main ballroom of Hotel Wil-
liam Penn.

Tom Gentry, now playing at the
Hotel Claridge in Memphis, will bring
his “Swanee Swing” to Pittsburgh for
the traditionally popular dance of the
year.

Featured with his orchestra is love-
ly Patricia Norman, formerly with
Paul Pendarvis, the William Penn’s
current, and Frank Raye. 5

An old tradition is being broken at
this dance since this is the ﬁrst time
that either the William Penn or a
big name band has been booked.

The dance is catering both to the
freshmen and the upperclassmen by
giving what will be one of the swank-
iest dances of the year. Tickets are
$2 per couple.

Parents Attend Annual
Chancellor’s Reception

Dr. Bowman Stresses Influence Of Friends, Of Faculty On
Scholarship, Character Traits Of Freshmen In
Address At Memorial Hall Friday Night

Almost 2,000 parents of University
freshmen heard an address by Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman, received the
grade cards of their sons and daugh-
ters, and met members of the faculty

at the annual Chancellor’s Reception
Friday night in Memorial Hall.

Dr. Bowman told the parents that
they are, in a sense, members of the
University faculty. He explained that
the students in school will change for
better or for worse as the result of
four inﬂuences: heritage of character
and mental capacity, character of
friends and associates, opportunities
to express themselves, and character
and scholarship of teachers.

The Chancellor’s address was pre-
ceded by a selection of numbers
played by the University orchestra,

under the direction of Lee M. Lock-
hart. Immediately following the talk,
.he auditorium program was conclud-
ed with several selections by the
Women’s Choral, directed by Mrs.
Robert D. Ayars.

The parents were then directed by
student aides upstairs to the banquet
hall, where they received the grade
cards of their sons and daughters for
the ﬁrst six weeks’ period from the
deans of the various undergraduate
schools. After that, they met pro-
fessors and faculty advisors to discuss
in conference the reasons for “John-
I1.''/'’S 01' Mary’s” grades. The faculty
members were stationed in booths
along the balcony of the banquet
floor.

A social hour with refreshments
concluded the program,

Faculty Donations To Chest
Average $16 As More
Pledges Come In

Holding close to the ﬁrst reported
aerage student contribution of one
dollar each, the returns in the Cain-
pus Chest drive, as of Friday, Novem-
ber 20, show that $2,072.95 had been
received in gifts from 2,759 students.
0;’ this, $769.12 was in cash.

In addition, 289 faculty nl€I1ll)€".I‘:>‘,
had given $2,757.30 by last Friday.
At this rate, the faculty and adminis-
tration will probably average $16 per
contribution, J. G. Quick, registrar
and general chairman, believes.

The counting and checking of en-
velopes turned in from the under-
graduate school-s has not yet been
completed. The student totals given
-.=.bo've are th-ojse.._of the undergradu-
ate sections only." The results of the
canvasse-s‘ in tl_ig‘*“"§‘l‘aduate and profes-
sional schools“ will be announced
later.

Meanwhile, groups of men and
women activity leaders will continue
personal solicitation today.

All subscribers to the chest drive
will receive a postal card certifica-
tion froin the treasurer’s office within
the next few days, according to Mr.
Quick. Donors of cash will be given
receipts, and the makers of pledges
will get notices of the date due and
amount of their promises.

The general chairman urges that
all pledges be paid as soon as possi-
ble to the treasurer, Room 7, State
Hall.

Freshmen who have not yet taken

Turkey Will Be Awarded
As Door Prize, To Go
On, Exhibit Today

By Herky (not the Turkey)

Gobble, gobble, gobble!

No, fellows, it’s not the usual “chin
music” permeating the Pitt News of-
fice. It’s just another advertising
scheme for Wednesday's College As-
sociation Thanksgiving Formal.

And it’s a real turkey. Right now
it is decorating, the ticket booth in
Alumni Hall near where you prob-
ably pi-cked up this paper. Later in
the day it will be seen promenading
down the Upperclass Walk to the
Cathedral.

The lucky ticket at the Grotto Ball-
room door Wednesday evening will
win the bird and all that goes with it.
And the sight of a college man in a
tux with a beautiful girl on one arm
and poor old “Herky, the Turkey”
under the other will have no alco-
holic connections. (Editor’s note:

You have to bring your own beautiful
girl.)

Prize More Palatable

At the last CA dance, a football,
autographed, was the evening's prize.
This time it’s more palatable, al-
though CA officers recommend “Her—
ky” as a particularly good pet and
a better watchdog.

Having announced this $1.00 per
couple dance several weeks ago, Col-
lege Association committeemen in
charge of it report a large early tick-
et sale.

Leo Ryan, '37, social chairman,
oelieves that the second College As-
sociation dance this year will be as
successful as their ﬁrst one last
“Coming at the end of the
six weeks grade period for freshmen
and just before Thanksgiving recess,
the dance should have a good turn-
out,” Ryan said.

Lichter To Speak
On ‘Thanksgiving’

 

“'l‘hanks-giving For What,” is the
subject of the speech to be given by
Rabbi Benjamin A. Lichter at the
Thanksgiving worship service in Heinz
House on Wednesday.

Rabbi Lichter from the B’Nai Is-
rael Synagogue on Negley avenue,
East Liberty, is known to the campus,
having spoken here before.

The quartet from the Men’s Glee
Club will sing several songs. Wor-
ship service is a joint project of the
YMCA and YWCA. The religious
program committee with Jane Kahler,
Ed_37; Mary Lou Wheeler, C38; and
William Kaphan, Ed37, as chairmen
is in charge of the affair.

x‘-‘ﬁrst tappee will be posted.

Requirements for admission to the
organization are a grade average of
1.39 and outstanding accomplishment
in one or more of
the prominent ac-
tivities. This year
an unlimited num-
ber of candidates
will be named to
the fraternity.

Starting at the
end of the ﬁrst
period, names will
be posted every
half hour on the
ODK key. Tappees
and members of
the ODK circle will
wear blue carna-
tions and pledge bars.

Albert C. Barr, C37, and David
Racusin, C37, president and vice-
president, will ofii-ciate. Candidates
to be tapped were elected at a meet-
ing yesterday, and include associate
and honorary members as well as the
activity leaders on campus.

Tappees are selected by the group
without the use of petitions, and men
tapped are not aware that they are
being considered until the names are
listed on tap day.

Initiation of tappees will take place
on Founders’ Day, December 7, in the
Hotel Schenley. Dr. Robert C. Cloth-
~ier, president of Rutgers University,
‘and former Dean of Men here, will
speak. Dr. Clothier came to the Uni-
versity in July, 1929, from the Hav-
erford school, where he had served
as headmaster. He was the featured
speaker at the Commencement here
in 1935.

Receive Plaques, Merit
Panthers Friday

 

More than 200 freshman men
and women were recognized
Friday morning as being out-
standing students in their class
as they received special honors
at ﬁnal customs assemblies.

Of the freshman women, 150
received merit panthers as the
last token that they had passed
through the introductory orientation
stage of development.

At the same time, approximately 75
freshman men were similarly honored
at the annual Freshman Tribunal
when they were presented with
plaques bearing the seal of the Uni-
versity.

Judgment of those to receive
awards was made upon a basis of
scholarship, customs examinations,
recommendations, and entrance into
activities.

These assemblies are held each year
on the morning of the Chancellor’s
Reception as the climax to the fresh-
man orientation program.

run 2,000 years, too. Anyway, they'd
run!

Tonight after the show, the mem-

known to his pards as “Butch”) will
recite the perennial “Casey at the

Butch will also recite “Pappy, please

Oh, boy, we Pitt Players have more

Wyer Suggests Amendment
Of Capitalistic System
To M-AE Seminar

 

Readjustment of our present social
and economic situation will come
through a constitutional change in
the capitalistic system. That is the
opinion which Samuel S. Wyer, na

stressed in his address to the com-
bined mechanical and aeronautical
engineering seminar on Thursday.

“Capitalism has given the Unite-d
States the highest living standard of
any nation in the world,” declared
Mr. Wyer, “but it has failed in bring-
ing about a system of fair distribu-
tion of our national wealth.”

tem keep pace with changing condi-

7 tions, Mr. Wyer suggests constitution-

a‘. adoption of the best features of
other philosophies of government.

Fascist Characteristics

Discussing characteristics of Fas-
cist governments, Mr. Wyer declared,
“Regardless of the suppression of per-
sonal liberties, Fascist governments
get things done eﬁiciently. But to
b: a good Fascist, you‘-have to be a
‘yes’ man; if you are not a ‘yes’ man,
you lose your head. In a dictator-

' lship there can no opposition.”

“Communism,” sta-ted Mr. Wyer,
“has put social planning on the map.
But the Russians are repudiating
Karl Marx's idea by adopting a con-

% stitution and providing in it that ev-
5 ery man shall be paid according to

hi.-. work.”

Freshman Leads

Field In Bridge Match

And a lowly freshman shall lead
them!

This was the situation in which
senior, junior, and sophomore con-
.'tract experts found themselves after
‘ the second weekly tournament of the
University Bridge Club.

J. R. Friday, C40, is the freshman
;who has led both tournaments. In
the ﬁrst he placed ﬁrst of ﬁve teams
with Jack Goleman, B.A40, as his
partner. Last week, with Stanley
Markey, C39, as his coho-rt, he placed
first in a tournament of nine teams.

As the results of the tournaments
were announced, the 20 students to
face the faculty were temporarily
chosen. A ﬁnal choice will be pub-
lished the afternoon before the
match which will probably take place
the Wednesday following the Thanks-
giving holidays.

that, “In 1912, Eugene Debs, the So-
cialist candidate for president, was
labeled as an irresponsible radical.
Yet since then, nine of his 11 plat-
form proposals have been made laws
by the Republicans and Democrats."
Claiming that debt cancellation is
the only possible way out of the pres-
ent debt situation, Mr. Wyer asserted
“The national debt of the United
States exceeds our national wealth.
At least 80 billion dollars of our
present debts must eventually be can-
celled outright.

“The war debts,” Mr. Wyer added.
“would decrease our national debt by
only ﬁve per cent, even if they were
paid in full. And it must be remem-
bered that they are not based on
actual value, but were computed on
inﬂated wartime prices of goods
which America sent to the Allies.”

Sophomore Coeds

Sophomore women have a surprise
in store for them today when they

be on time for the meeting they will
be permitted to take their lunches

extra points were made on placement
kicks by Farkas, who was responsible
for 14 of the Pitt point total.

Farkas took two passes from Cas-

the third touchdown was the result
of another pass, this one thrown by
the Navy. Cassanio intercepted it on

Kappa Sig-Phi Delt Winner

v Meets Phi Garns In Final
Game Next Monday

 

After a series of jerks and
jolts Interfraternity touch foot-
ball comes close to the ﬁnals
when the Phi Delts battle the

Kappa Sigs this afternoon on
Trees Gym ﬁeld. Meanwhile the Phi
Gams, who have climbed to the top
of the upper bracket, play checkers
as they await the'outcome of the
semi-ﬁnal match. Arrangements call
for the ﬁnal game Monday afternoon,
November 30, on the Trees Gym ﬁeld.

S'tale—mated.-*by the inaction and

',,thewKappa. .Sig-Phi Ep playoff, the

Phi Delts have ‘seen little action in
the past two weeks. Before that time

they kept an untarnished record by

tripping the Lambda ‘C-his in the first
round and later the Sigma Chis, who
had remained in the league by vir-

tue of _.'a close win over Phi Kappa.

. Smith Heaves ’Em
Phi Delts bid Bernie Cashdollar,

who has proven that he can stand

out as well in a backﬁeld as he can
on adance ﬂoor, to the Hall of Inter-
fraternity grid glory. The combina-
tion of Smith snaring Cashdol1ar’s
pass-es has already helped the Phi
Delts out of a tight spot.

The defending champs, the Kappa
Sigs, sailed through the Pi Lams in

' the opening bracket but stumbled mo-
_ mentarily in the ﬁrst Phi Ep encoun-

ter, when they were held to a tie.
In‘ the play-off Charley Groat, Kappa
Sig All-Frat contender, played bang-

‘up ball by circling left end for one

touchdown and intercepting a Phi
Eps _ pass to contribute the lion
share of a 15-6 decision.

Independent League progress has
fared about the same as the Frater-

between the Newman Club and Med
School victors remains to decide this
tourney. Delays in general and rain
In particular have been the greatest
factors in tying up motion in both
leagues.

Third Sport On Feely Menu
To Begin November 30

 

Although touch football and the
Panther Run have been concluded on
the Intramural schedule, that does
not mean that the door has been
closed on further Intramural activi-
ties. On the week of November 30,
volley ball will be the course offered
by Martin J. Feely on the Intramural
menu. . .

At present Mr. Feely is busily em-
ployed forming plans for his volley
ball tourney. Observing the national
volley ball rules, six men will com-
pose a team,-but each entry may have
12 men on the squad. Because the
tourney is scheduled to get under way
the week after Thanksgiving all en-
tries for the affair must be in this
week.

Any club or group on the campus
may sponsor a team and several in-
dependents may band together to
form a sextette. Every participant
in the net game will be awarded
points towards an Intramural athletic
letter. _

Fraternities have been mailed entry
blanks and a schedule for the Greek
league will be released either today
or Wednesday. A copy of the sched-
ule will be mailed each fraternity.

Progress

SUPPORT OF THE University’s concentrated

drive for an $11,000 contribution to the Com-
munity Fund was especially noteworthy during
the latter stages of the past week.

It has been many years since a campaign of
this sort has been handled in such workman-
like fashion, has achieved such popular response,
and has marked a similar group of administra-
tors and student and faculty supporters with so
much commendation. It is a tribute to this Uni-
versity’s one hundred and ﬁfty years of progress
to have such whole-hearted support and interest
in the sesqui-centenntial year.

After Wednesday’s initial opening drive, it
was reported that there were very few of those
already contacted who had yet to sign a pledge.
Thursday was devoted almost entirely to reach-
ing those who had yet to be approached. On
Friday the “ﬂaying squad” had very little to do,
since there were so very few remaining in the
“clean-up” group.

There was no “high-pressuring” in the method
of approach, merely a statement of the salient
points of the program. Student solicitors were

especially tactful, needing no frenzied arm-wav-
ing lines of salesmanship. Virtually everyone
had heard or read the need for such a campaign,
was impressed by the necessity of the reports,
and when the time came for action, responded
immediately and cheerfully. This has been the
ﬁrst time in four years of careful observation
that this situation has existed.

Every person assisting from J. G. Quick, di-
rector of the University campaign, down to the
smallest student contributor, has been respon-
sible for the remarkable results. But especially
should Mr. Quick, Dr. Lanfear, and the various
executives in. control, be commended. We should
all be proud of what has been done during the
past few days. Such things are vital and lasting.

Another Reception

CHANCELLOR JOHN G. BOWMAN’S re-

ception to parents of the present freshman
class Friday evening once more was a distinct
social triumph. Parents were ushered into a Me-
morial Hall of endless receiving lines, sparkling
with the bright exuberance of youthful wel-
comers who guided the evening's guests from
attraction to attraction with professional ﬁnesse.

Flanking the cordial, gracious center that was
Dr. Bowman were the equally gracious guests,
dominated by Dean Thyrsa Wealhtheow Amos, of
happy young ladies in contrasting formals. An-
other group served cakes, coffee and mints with
the same charming ease that pervaded the re-

ceiving line.
F mm a position above the receiving lines of

activity there is a great deal of congestion
with interested parents seeking information from
the various instructors in the narrow hallways
of the balcony.

After all are gone from the top, there are still
some few in the lower receiving and serving re-
gions. Next year at this time, the upper guests
may not depart so hurriedly, pausing perhaps
to take in the oriental atmosphere of the Chi-
nese room, or the simplicity of the Scottish unit
surrounding a new, spacious Commons room
where “grandeur feasts the eye.” That day is
coming, and when it does, the evening will be
complete.

who received the “Happy Birthday, To You,”

toast early in the afternoon, and again it was

Should we give it away and say that it was

Ouch! . . .

Torn Bricker, Theta Chi prize halfback,
has been nursing a broken nose ever since
their Phi Gain tilt. .

When some of the brothers from the Phi
Kappa house journeyed to New York
a while back to see THE game, they had a
reunion with some of the more famous last
year's grads. Joe Rodgers is working in the
sales department of the Bakelite company,
and Pete Noon (remember No. 5 on the bas-
ketball team?) is a tool salesman for the
Mall Tool company. ,

Chi Omegas entertained Miss Helen Gor-
don, a chapter visitor from Tennessee, over
the week-end. She was a guest at their fall
rushing tea.

Kappa Sig pledges staged a house dance
on Saturday night that was neatly executed,
according to reports . . . John Thomas is the
new Lambda Chi social chairman.

Helen Poole and Grace Augensteinhave
been initiated into Delta Zeta’s active chap-
ter.

We hope that no one gets the cold shoul-
der, but the ZTAs made us kinda shiver
when they mentioned a Snowball dance to
be held at their house on Friday night.

On Getting Engaged . . .

Ruth Greene, who happens to be treasurer
of Panhellenic Council, announced her engage-
ment to Alvin Leppert at the AEPhi meeting
last Monday night, and almost at the same
time the Delta Zetas were feasting on a box
of chocolates that Iris Kennedy presented to
the actives in announcing her engagement to
Phillip Christ.

Sound And ; “life;

ROBABLY A FIRST COLUMN should not be serious.

I have a feeling sometimes that it shouldn’t be. A
budding writer, after all, according to the established
mores, should appeal to the less formal side of our
natures, should tickle our funnybones, an-d, in general,
present life as an amusing spectacle.

Levity and wit, then, do have a place in a column;
but I think that in one’s initial bow to the public, humor,
facetiousness, parody, and such should be eschewed.

Long ago when I was younger, and as a consequence,
less wise, I believed that a column should be a sort of
oracle, praising the virtuous and the good, denouncing
the wicked and the improvident, and blasting scorn at
the in-betweens. Today I am not sure that any column
can do this eternally and still appear in print. The
"life-is-seriou.s-and-the-grave-is-not-its-goal" attitude is
probably sheer dead weight as far as circulatiion is con-
cerned.

Need Varied Diet

BUT I STILL THINK that now and then a column
can make a plea for intelligent thinking on the
part of its readers, that people do not expect to be fed
solely on a diet of gossip columns, biographies of movie
stars and gangsters, articles on home cookery, and stor-
ies of divorce proceedings. I may be mistaken,‘ but I
think that some of us occasionally enjoy thinking, and
that others of us could develop the habit without get-
ting a nervous breakdown. '
Especially should this be t_rue of college students.
They should have ideas about what is going on about
them in the world and be willing to discuss’ those ideas.
I believe that there is little point in going to school if
one learns nothing to talk about, if some aspect of the
world of ideas, events and personalities does not capture
the imagination. -
College students should be better ﬁtted by training
for thinking and discussing ideas than other people, for
the primary function of a university, as I see it, is to
open the door of the gilded cage of an individual’s in-
nate intellectual provincialism. Classes and personal
associations are in a sense forums where faulty think-
ing, ignorance, prejudice, and conceit are rubbed out
of us. University students are supposed to represent
the cream of the intellectual crop, and in a rough sense
they should correspond to Plato’s guardian class, a body
of people in Whom knowledge and ability are combined

with social consciousness.

H igh‘ School Atmosphere

S TRICTLY SPEAKING, though, I think that the ma-

jority of American college students have about as
much social consciousness as turtles. The atmosphere
of college classrooms and corridors for the most part is
akin to that of high schools. The essential fault may
lie in that college students are too young, that they
should spend a year or two in the buzzing, booming
world before coming to a university. Or again, the
difficulty may be that sharp lines of social conﬂict have
not appeared, and that until they do there will be little
attention paid to social topics.

There is no doubt in my mind that college students
need to be galvanized into a deeper appreciation of
today's environment, for this is no ordinary age that
we live in. The industrial system, after two centuries
of growth, has attained maturity, and unless an adjust-
ment is made with it, the world is likely to go up in a
whiff of shrapnel.

As I write these lines tonight, the Insurgent army is
shelling Madrid, reducing its proud buildings to sham-
bles, littering its shaded streets with dead. The German
Nazis and the Italian Fascists, in formally recognizing
General Franco as the head of the Spanish nation, have
ﬂung an unmistakable challenge of war to Russia. Wide-
spread labor unrest, gangsterism, an economic system
tearing itself apart with its own misapplied energy,
political revolution, and a whole conglomeration of social
forces in conﬂict are the rule rather than the exception.
These things limn the picture of a never quite serene
America in bold and forbidding outlines.

Should Know Causes

WE CANNOT, if we would survive, skip over the
bristling headlines to the comic strip and sports
page every evening. What is happening in Spain is a
small token of what may happen in America. There
have been two revolutions in the U. S. and there is no
reason to think that there may not be a third.
“Apres moi, la deluge,” wisecracked Louis XV. Per-
halls! Yet. (Well if We take this attitude, we must neces-
sarily, like the French king, know the causes of the
Impending ﬂ0_od. We should make an effort to under-
stand the social forces struggling throughout the world
for supremacy.

Possibly it is best not to be serious’ after all_

Pharmacists Need
Organization, Says
Institute Assistant

 

“The Importance of Organization
in Phai-1nacy" was stressed by Dr.
George D. Beal, assistant director of
rlellon Institute and president of the
American Pharmaceutical Associa-
tion, at an assembly last Friday.

The affair was held at the School
=f Pharmacy and was sponsored by
the student. branch of the American
Pharmaceutical Association.

Dr. Beal gave a description of the
rise of the pharmaceutical profession
from prehistoric beginnings until
nodern times. Using this as a pre-
’:'ace, he went on to show the two
reasons for the necessity of organiza-
tion in the profession. The ﬁrst,
which as he pointed out might be
considered by some a selﬁsh reason,

Iwas the material aid it gave to in-
: dividual pharmacists in making rapid

progress. Also, that it built better
business, made working conditions
better, and restricted unfair compe-
tition. ‘

The second reason, he character-
ized as a social one. ‘It had to do

- with professional pride and a natural

love of the profession.

Students Show Unwillingness

To Enroll In European War

With a major war.threat brewing
in Europe, only 13 University stu-
dents, polled in the latest campus
questionnaire of the Institute of Pub-
lic Opinion, declared their willingness
to ﬁght in such a war.

Opposed to the 13 were 365 stu-
dents, some of whom pencilled in
qualiﬁcations on their opposition to
war. Male students balloting on the
war question divided their vote, 11
for and 243 against engaging in
a European war. Expressing the
same opposition, 122 women voted no
and two voted yes.

Considering the prevention of an-
other world war, students were asked

their opinion on the feasibility of a
new international conference to limit
and reduce armaments. Not so em-
phatic on this point, students were
still strongly in favor of peace.

In favor of such a conference were
282,_and opposed 98. Asked whether
the United States should call such a
conference, 181 students said yes, and
1'15 voted no.

Asked about the controversial
teachers’ loyalty oaths, 87 students
marked their approval, and 297 their
disapproval.

Student opinion was least . ..phatic
on. the point of chain-store taxes. 250
being in favor, and 116 opposed to
P e1"1S?lvania’s levying such taxes.

Miller, Crime Expert,
Will Speak At Forum

the subject of Deputy United States
General Justin Miller at the Com-
munity Forum this evening. The
Forum will be held in the Schenley
high school auditorium at 8 o'clock.

  Italian Club To Meet

 

Miss Loretta Byrne of Schenley
high school, who spent the summer
in Italy, will address the Italian Club
at its social meeting tonight at 8
o'clock, in Room 1309, Cathedral.

According to the latest reports,
plans for the completion of the Lith-
uanian Room are advancing with
much‘ rapidity.

Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, head
of the Nationality Rooms, has been
in Lithuania and reports that with
the aid of the architect, Gudaitis, cer-
tain decisions have been reached.

He suggest-s that the wall of the
room be covered with a hand-woven
linen which will have as its design
“The Flight of the Birds.” It is thus
entitled because it depicts the path
followed in the heavens when the
birds ﬂy south.

There will be a cornice of light and
dark oak around the room. The dark
oak will be brought from Lithuania
where it has lain in the river for
many years.

The room will also contain the
“Lithuanian School,” a sculpture d-one
by Rimsa, who had an exhibit on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral in Sep-
tember.

Plans For Lithuanian Room

Completion Advance Rapidly

Dr. J. Bayls, director of Lithuan-
ian Folk-lore Archives in Kaunas,
Lithuania, has sent two victrola rec-
ords from Lithuania.

The records are tunes of peasant
folk music which have been played
and sung by the peasants exclusively.
Curved needles are used in playing
the records, and the playing starts
from the center instead of the edge.
