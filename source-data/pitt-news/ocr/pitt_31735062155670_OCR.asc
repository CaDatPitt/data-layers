Ceramics,

Make Seventh Floor
Art Gallery Disp

By CATHERINE WILSON‘

Colorful, modern pottery is on display this month in the
University’s Fine ‘Arts Gallery on the seventh floor. Known
as the ‘Artists and Potters of Vallauris,” this exhibition is a
contemporary,French collection of the works of the: artists

in that area. -

The exhibition was assembled and brought to this ‘coun-
try by Rene Batigne, founder and director of the Museum of
Vallauris and friend of the artists living‘» and working there.
In recent years, many French painters—Arp, Chagall, Dufy,
Leger, Matisse, Miro, Picasso and.Prinner among them-——have

‘made potteries of great originality
and distinction. ;

Work by some of these well-
known painters may be seen
among the" approximately eighty

'potteries included in the exhibi-

tion. In addition, there are cera-
mics by well-known professional
potters living and working in ‘the
small Mediterranean town of Val-
lauris. .

Mr. Virgil Cantini, ﬁne arts in-
structor at the University,'point.s
out that it is interesting to see
the relationship between the paint-
tiers and designs.

Hesays that pottery has suffer-

V_ ed for a long time from a lack of

“First Time” Event

According to Rene Batigne, this
is the ﬁrst time a contemporary
collection has been assembledfor
a single display in Franc'e‘follow-
ed by a tour through the United
States. ,

W. R. TURKES
New E&M Dean

Tomorrow, /“The Skyscraper Engineer,” Pitt’s only stu-
dent magazine, will go on sale.

The magazine, which is a technical quarterly, is pub-
lished by students in the Schools of’ Engineering and .Mines.

According to Jim Fallon,

editor, this ﬁrst publication

of the fall semester will be the largest issue of"i‘The Sky-

scraper Engineer” ever printed.  v‘v '

In it, there will be 52 pages’
which will include a section de-
voted to the department heads of
the School -of Engineering and
Mines:

Special features willinclude an
editorial, the Dean’s page, pic-
tures from freshman camp, notes
on alumni,‘ and news of the latest
progress_in en-
gineering de-
sign.

As a novelty-
feature, Fallon
says there will

jokes and pic-’
tures from the
American So-
ciety of Metal
Exposition in _
Cleveland. F H
The problem 3 on

page will feature a “‘brainbuster”.
Any student to present -the ﬁrst

    

to produce pottery in one of the
town’s ancient pottery studios.
Other artists followed Picasso, and
tourists along the Riviera began
visiting the town in, increasing
numbers.
Wide Variety

Due to such a large gathering
of artists working side by side at
the same craft, the production is
remarkably diversified, including
not only beautiful decorative ob-
jects of art, but also thesimplest
cooking vessels for the average
household.

For instance, Picasso brings new
life to a soup tureen by ‘decorat-
ing it with a bold, multi-colored
ﬁsh pattern. Two useful kitchen
articles are the gleaming, coal-
black water pitcher and covered
dish by Andre Martin.

For Men. Too

A suitable item for a man’s den
is the beautifully marked tobacco
jar by Baud, as well as Prinner’s
small black duck ash tray ,

As Mr. Batigne - points, out,
“Ceramic art has recently-taken a
new lease on life. Today the most
famous artists, painters or sculp-
tors do not think it beneath their
dignity to tackle the innumerable
problems set forth by clay, glazes,

' “This renewed interest in -an

correct answer will receive a car-
ton of cigarettes.

Technical articles will include
Industrial TV, Color Film, and
Industrial Incentives.

“Most proﬁtable pages,” says
Fallon, “will be those devoted to
a series of engineering oppor-
tunities with Pittsburgh’s indus-
trial giants”. This issue will pre-.
sent the inside story; of the train-
ing program at Westinghouse and
the story of the National Supply
C0,, the world’s largest manufac-
turer of oil field machinery and
equipment.

"Prof Parleys a Few Questions

Scholar Contrasts Universities

Mullert Memorial Room overﬂowed on Monday and mem-
bers of the Humanities Society crowded the doorways to hear
a professor from Grenoble, France. '

' Q’s and A’s
Dr. Armand Carraccio, professor of comparative liter-

ature at the University of Gren-9

oble in southeast France, spoke in
his native language in a question
and answer session from 3:30 to
4:30 p.m. Dr. Benjamin W. Hasel-
tine, head of Pitt’s department of
modern languages, translated Dr.
Carraccio’s answers. -
Commenting on the difference
between French and American

universities, Dr. Carraccio noticed
that here, the instructor follows
the progress of each student close-
ly. In France, the instructor does
not know the names of his stu-
dents. In fact, the student goes to
classes or not, as he likes.

ODK Rated
High With

Honoraries  

By JIM DeWEES‘E

Among the honorary socie-
ties at Pitt, ODK stands as
one of the most highly rated.

’Membership denotes a high

standard of leadership and
involves more than just the right
to wear a_ key and have a name
inscribed on the roster. All'mem-
bers of ODK are chosen for ﬁve
qualities. ' I
Character First

Primary consideration for mem-
bership is character. Leadership
andservice in campus life follow
and help to determine character.
Scholarship is the third ranking
consideration.

-The man under‘ consideration
must rank in the top 35 per cent
of his,» class, Fellowship and con-
secration to democratic ideals
complete the list of qualifications
for membership in ODK.‘

Pitt Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa was founded on June 9,
1916, just a year and a half after
the society’s founding at Washing-
ton and Lee University in Vir-
ginia.

At that time Pitt’s Circle was

the third in the United States.

There are now 8 Circles located
throughout the country.

. Threefold Purpose

At the time of its founding,‘
ODK’s purpose was three-fold and
it remains so today: recognition of
junior and senior men who have
attained a high standard of ef-
ficiency in collegiate activities,
bringing together. men who best

~ represent all phases of collegiate

life, and union of faculty and
students on a basis of mutual in-
terest and understanding.

ODK recognizes and encour-
ages achievement in scholarship,
athletics, social and religious af-
fairs, publications, speech, music,
and the drama. Members are tap-

Latin and Greek are emphasized
more than in the United States.
Their civilization is based upon
th e 'Latino-Greek civilizations.

However, he notes a “metaphysical.

anxiety” among American students
to parallel the industrial em-
phasis of American life with lib-
eral arts. .

Deﬁning culture, Dr. Carraccio
quoted Herriot. “Culture is what
remains in the mind when every-
thing else has been forgotten.”

Next meeting of the Humanities
Society will be Nov. 24, when
members of Pitt Players will pre-
sent. excerpts from “Electra.”

ODK Key Of Achievement

ELMER. SHUSTER, ODK presi-
dent, is shown holding a large-
size replica of the Omicron Delta

and again in May.
Name Chiseled

Inorder to single out and re-
ward the man who has done most
to further the ideals of the organ-
ization, ODK established the
Senior Award. Each year the man
who has been ‘selected for this
award has‘ his name inscribed in
ODK Walk between Heinz Chapel

Religious Ed. Leaders

 

Hold - 50th Convention

Religious Education Association celebrated its Golden
Anniversary Convention in Pittsburgh beginning Nov. 8 and
ending Nov. 10. “The Place and Provision of Religious Edu-
cation in Our Times” -was the convention theme.

Seventy-seven eminent Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant

leaders participated in the pro-6

gram. Included in the program
were The Very Rev. Paul C. Rein-
ert, S.J., President of St. Louis
University;~ Rabbi Abba Hillel Sil-
ver, Cleveland; The Rev. Dr. Hen-
ry Pitney Van Dusen, President of
Union Theological Seminary,- New
York City, and Dr. Theodore M.
Greene, Professor‘ of Philosophy
and "Master of Silliman College,
Yale University.

Convention program focused on

three broad concerns: the need for

more adequate religious education

today; the philosophy of educa-

tion in America which pervades
thinking about education and
makes religion either peripheral or
central in planning education for
youth; a critical analysis of and
proposals for improving the insti-

tutional “apparatus” of ‘religious
education in America.

It explored aspects of American
culture, government, religious in-
stitutions, and philosophies of edu-
cation which impede provision 
substantial religious education for
millions, of American and Cana-
dian youth. ’

Three general assemblies exam-

ined the issues and problems posed
by the theme. Later, in twelve
seminar and workshop ‘groups,
members formulated proposals for
improving the place and provision
of religious education in our times.

A ﬁnal assembly of the entire con--

vention considered directions in
which religious education should
move in the future to assure all
youth effective religious training.

Mrs. Glenn Walter Mars, direc-
tor of the‘ program of industrial
nursing at the University of Pitts-
burgh, was quoted as saying that
there is avserious shortage of pro-
fessionally trained nurses in this
ﬁeld. .

She stated that about 71.9‘ per-
cent of today’s industrial nurses
have had no special training for
their positions. 1 Their instructions
are the result of “in—service” train-
ing programs, conducted -by. in-
dustries. . .

“An industrial nurse is one who
practices the art and science of
nursing in industry and meets the

health needs of the worker,” says
Mrs. May.

Administering care under medi-
cal guidance, assisting in physical
examinations, maintaining health
records, and conducting health re-

views are part of the duties of the

industrial nurse.

J. Paul iSheedy* Switched to Wildroot Cream-Oil
Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test

"Your hair’; no yoke" bellowed Sheedy’s gal. “Those cowlicks look awful.
Why not take the bull by the horns and get yourself some Wildroot
Cream-Oil, America's favorite hair tonic? Keeps hair combed without

greasiness. Makes you look cud-dly. Removes loose, ugly
dandruff. Relieves annoying dryness. Contains Lanolin.
Non-alcoholic. I won’: cow-‘tow ’til you start using it
heifery day.” Paul was udderly stunned, so he bought
some Wildroot Cream-Oil for just 29¢. He told his girl
the' good moo_s and now they‘re hitched for life. So just
steer yourself down to any toilet goods counter for a
bottle or handy tube. And remember to ox your barber
A for Wildroot Cream-Oil too. You’ll be the cream of

the ca.mpus—and that's nobull.

One of the most wasteful practices at Pitt has ﬁnally.
been eliminated by Student Congress. .

The solons decided last week, at a little publicized
meeting, to make ‘chairmen of the ‘various social events
subject to direct responsibility to Student Congress. In the
‘past, the"-chairman of a social affair had comp-letecontrol ~
overlthe budget and used the money as he saw ﬁt. If the
event‘ lost money the University made it up without even
questioning the chairman. V I '

There was waste through duplication of effort and per-
haps unintentional mismanagement of funds, but the real
"danger seemed to lie in the fact that one man had con-

. trol of sums as high as $1500. We were fortunate in hav-

ing honest chairmen in the past, but this was a potentially
dangerous situationthat could not be allowed to continue.

Student Congress must be commended for their action
‘onthis matter, but a great deal of the credit must go to
John Ney, a Pitt News reporter and former Commons Room
Ball chairman, who brought this matter to their attention.
Ney’s entire list of recommendations was accepted by Stu-
dent Congress, and if properly and adequately adminis-
tered will eliminate any chance of graft—-even on a small
scale. ‘ -

two days after receiving Dexter’s
records from the FBI. The rec-

White to be Executive Director
of the International Monetary

by the FBI this -is a serious
charge. Especially since an .ex—

involved. \

In ‘1948,’ approximately one
year after White resigned his
post with the government, some
really incriminating charges be-
gan ﬂying. These were made by
one Elizabeth Bentley, ,,a self-
confessed communist, when she
faced the House of Un-American
Activities Committee.

The events of the time are sig-
niﬁcant to the developments of
they present. .

According to TIME magazine,

_August 9, 1948, Elizabeth Bent-

ley said that White helped put
communists in strategic offices of

I the government and supplied in-

formation to her through Gregory
Silvermaster, a government em-
ployee. She admitted giving the
information to the Communist
party. She added, “White knew
where it (the information) was
going but preferred not to men-
tion the fact.” V V
TIME—August 16,1948. Whit-
taker Chambers answered the
questions of the investigating
committee. He did not speciﬁc-
ally charge White but calledhim
a f ello w traveler V, perfectly

'— willing .to , cooperate with the
Communist party. Chambers said

that he had tried to influence
White to break with the party
when he did but that White had
refused. .

The investigating committee
then called in Victor -Perlo, a
man named by Elizabeth Bentley
as being a communist;

Perlo took the stand but denied
knowing. any of the other com-

dents were resigned to the fact that they were in
for a very long afternoon with little promise of
‘anything to cheer about. This was particularly in"
evidence when a snowball battle in the stands be-
tween several policemen and few students caused
more than two-thirds, of the spectators to miss
the scoring of Pitt’s third touchdown.

The visitors were made to

mies named by _Bentley except
one—Harry Dexter.

TIME, August 23, 1948. Dexter
went before the committee. He
denied ever knowing Elizabeth
Bentley but admitted he was
friendly with Whittaker Cham-

_ bers, Perlo, . and Silvermaster.

However he denied knowing that
these people were» communists
and ‘he also denied that he was"
or ever had been a‘ member of
the Communist party.

At the time Dexter knew him,
Perlo was very active with Hen-
ry Wal1ace’s Progressive Party.

During the course of the in-
vestigations, it was discovered
that Silvermaster had,,been listed
by the Civil Service as a com-
munist for four years. The White
House knew this but Silvermas-
ter kept his job. * ,

Harrier Meet

For the first time this season the
Harriers have been disappointed.
The disappointment did not come
in the form of a defeat but in a
cancellation of the crucial Villa-
nova meet scheduled for last Sat-
urday.

Coach Carl Olson’s boys, _ex-
pecting their tenth win, were just
aching to get their teeth into Wild-
eat meat but were stymied due to
la "snowstorm an-d then a can-
cellation by the Villanova team.
Because of the snow the Wildcats

ooul_dn”t make the trip to Pitt Sat-
urday so the meet was postponed
until Monday.

The Villanova coach later called
and said his team wouldn’t be
able to make the meet at all. It
was later learned. that Fred
Dwyer, the mile sensation, had
becom.e ill over the weekend.

State’s Dixie Neighbors
Helpful in ‘Ea sy’ Contest

By DAVE MAZER

' Although they didn’t offer much of struggle, those South-
ern boys from ‘Virginia left their mark on the Panthers last

Saturday. ~

Virginia’s ﬁguring must have been that if they couldn’t
beat Pitt, at least they could soften up the upstart Yankees
for a fellow Southern school, North Carolina_State, this week’.

_No matter what their planning, the Virginians hit the

Panthers hardest as far as injuries?‘-

are concerned, with All-American
tackle Eldred Kraemer dislocat-
ing a shoulder and being lost for
the remainder of the season.
Injury List Grows

This was an especially hard blow
to the Panthers, since the 6-3, 215-
pound lineman from Clear Lake
was a stalwart on. offense and de-
fense again this year and his loss
will be felt in the Penn State tilt.

Captain Dick Deitrick and Paul
Blanda also were casualties of the
Dixie contest, thus joining Guards
Ed Stowe and Rudy Grunder.
Deitrick suffered a slight concus-
sion and was detained at a local
hospital the early part of the week
but the hard-ﬁghting captain as
well as Blanda, who re-aggravated
his knee, will most likely be ready
for the Wolfpack.

Otherwise, the Blue and Gold
will be looking for North Caro-
lina State to put up a better bat-
ter battle than their Conferedate
cohorts, since the Wolfpack play-
ed Army a tight game until the
last quarter last weekend.

Wolfpack Improves

Inaddition,‘ State will have 20
freshmen who were regulars on
either the offensive or defensive
platoonsiback, more seasoned and
better versed in the Sp1it—T as em-
ployed by Coach Horace Hendrick-
son.- «T ‘

These boys have been slow in
coming around but indications in
the last two Wolfpack encounters
show that the Panthers do have

non, a pitcher in his own right,
turned catcher for this game to
help his battery mate pave the way
to. victory.

The Sigs came back with a pass
from Bud Spangler to Dick Sny-
der that was good for six points.
The point after touchdown was

ARBITEN

Delts. However, this was offset

The Panther soccer team
will make its first appearance
in University history at Ells-
worth Field t o d ay in its
ﬁnal ‘ game of the season
against Slippery Rock. The
winless Panthers will be out
to crack the victory column and
avenge a defeat suffered last week
at the hands of the same foe.

Team spirit abounds abthe prac-
tice sessions, and the students who
attend this afternoon’s contest
will be assured of seeing a team
exhibiting a great desire to win. _

"The game was originally set to
be played at the Stadium, but
adverse weather conditions have
made it necessary to switch the
scene of the game to Ellsworth
Center. The team will be at full
strength with the exception of
Norm Zanardelli, who was injured
last week.

Those proponents of single platoon football who prom-
ised fewer injuries under the new system might be look-
ing for a new selling point ifthe substitution rule comes up
for discussion after this season, That is, if the situation here

proves typical of the injury picture around the rest of the

college circuit. Pitt Trainer Howard Waite and his able
assistant, Roger McGill,~ have ben working overtime at their
dressing-room workbench, especially since the Minnesota
game. . ,

Right now the ailing list is certainly no slimmer than
at the worst point last season under free substitution,,par‘—

S-ticularly with the recent addition of Eldred Kraemer. He’ll.

be out until next year. .Rud-y Grunder hasn’t been in the
lineup since the Oklahoma tie, and Ed Stowe still nurses a
bad leg as a souvenir of the Minnesota debacle- Although
Dick Deitrick manages to stick in every battle, he usually
ﬁnds it difficult getting around for a long time afterwards
on two stiff painful props. The Danville plugger couldn’t
be pulled out of the starting lineup with a winch and chain.
The hardest blow the Panthers felt last year came when
Joe Schmidt’ suffered a concussion after being kicked in the
head during the N otre Dame upset. Two other regulars were
put out of action—Johnny Jacobs and Bill Hoﬁman———but
only for a short spell.
2!: all
No one can ever say that “this or that precaution will
reduce injuries on the playing ﬁeld—they just happen.‘ No
rule can govern the behavior of bone and muscle when
bodies fall fast and heavy in the heat of action. And who
could have predicted that. Paul Blanda,‘ place ‘kicker and
linebacker, would have been‘ banged up While playing the

Jenkins was the ﬁrst to draw

stripe from the one-yard line on
a ﬁrst quarter score set up by a
Salvaterra interception. “Bugs”
Bagamery booted the extra piont.

In the second period West Vir-
ginia drove 50 yards for a six-
pointer but couldn’t tack on the
extra point and the half-time sepa-
rated the two squads by one point.

Salvaterra widened the mar-
gin in the third quatter by
bootlegging the pigskin 52 yards
for the second Panther score. A
plunge by Jenkins made the
score 14-6. The Morgantown

A very fastidious college senior decided toadd a few col-
ored shirts to his wardrobe. So one afternoon, he strolled

down to the local shirt shop.

"I'd like to see your smartest

colored shirts,” he said to the clerk.
The clerk laid several Van Heusen Vanahue Broadcloths

on the counter. "These are our

best sellers," he said. “They’re

tailored of fine, high-count broadcloth that's very smooth
‘~ and luxurious. And you can‘ take your pick of eight different
collar styles—including Van Heusen’s new short collars that

are the rage of the college set.

"They sure look good to me,” said the senior.

“Good? They’re terriﬁc!” replied the clerk. "Just look at
that magic sewmanship—Van Heusen’s ﬁnest. Why, even the
buttons are top quality, genuine ocean pearl. And Vanahue
Broadcloths come in every color of the rainbow—from soft,
subtle shades to rich robust tones. 'What’s more, they're only

$3.95 apiece."

“Do you have henna colorPi’, asked the young man.
, ‘.‘That’s just what I got ﬁnished telling you,” answered the
clerk. "You can have henna color you want!”
