Spot‘ Check . : .

Studying Studied

Dick Bibler’s Worthal dragged a buddy from
the library to a place where they could really
study -— the cafeteria — in last Wednesday’s Little
Man" on-Campus‘ cartoon. Since ﬁnding a good
place to study is a ‘familiar
problem for most students, I de-
cided to survey some of the
libraries and other study placer
on campus to determine "what
their good and bad points are.
When I listed various features
one would wish a good place for
studying to have, I found that
the different spots attract*s_tu-
dents with various needs.

Lighting "conditions in these -=
various spots are fairly "good, , .
with few exceptions. In the Commons _Room,_for
example, those round tables under the chandeliers
and the balcony desks with lamps in working shape
provide ample light. However, many‘ timid souls
shun the tables directly under the chandeliers be-
cause the thought of something suspended from the
third ﬂoor hanging over them is too disconcerting
to allow calm‘ contemplation. Two of the library
rooms aren’t quite right in thelighting department."
On a cloudy day, The Fine Arts Library on the 7th
ﬂoor seems underlit, while sunny days show too
much glare in the Alldred Room on the sixth ﬂoor.

Cool Water _

Two aspects -of comfort to be considered are
types of chairs and the nearness of a good water
fountain. I like to alternate. between soft stuffed
chairs and hard straight-back ones;/-too much time
spent in either canleave one’s back sore. The four
soft chairs in the center of the ‘sixth ﬂoor Reserve
Book Room and the hard chairs in the basement
Open Stacks are my personal favorites.‘ Ifyou get
thirsty often and are ﬁnicky, you might like to
know that the fountain in the Open Stacks spouts
about the coldest water in the Cathedral.

, The Alldred Room and the Open ‘Stacks get
my.votes for privacy. The desks at the end of the
shelves -in the Open Stacks offer no distractions
when absolute concentration is necessary. If you
pile into one of those high—backed lounge chairs in
the Alldred Room, turn it toward the'wall, and
then slouch down, you are somewhat invi_sible and
isolated. And if you can resist the temptation to
turn around and look whenever you hear someone

 

‘to our friend Worthal, in the» cafeteria.

By Barry Cross‘

entering the room, then you’ll not be distracted.

Of course there are times when you want to
take a break. Langley Hall offers only cigarette,
candy, and soft drink machines. For real food
you’re out of luck if you don’t want to _leave the
building. In the Cathedral there is the Tuck Shop
with lots of goodies or, if you want to take a walk
in the nippy minus ﬁve degree weather, there is
the SU cafeteria or the Hunt Room.

Other factors seem a bit more complicated than
sustenance, chairs, and lighting. Here, each stu-
dent’s individual quirks determine where he will
feel comfortable. If human nature fascinates you
enough to distract you from your studies, then
stay away from the Fine Arts,Library. Arts. majors
with their beards, sandals, book sacks, and wild
clothing provide a sharp contrast to the brief-case
carrying and slide rule sliding engineers who also
hang out there. Watching them wastes time. Be-
sides, once you break away from" your studies you
are liable to pick up one of the books about
painting and look at the pictures.

Squeuk! Squeak!

A fairtly acute sense of hearing can cause you
discomfort in the Alldred Room for, although ear-
phones are used with the record players, loud notes
come through to some readers as ‘disconcerting
squeaks. For some reason, contrary to other library
rooms oncampus,‘ some sense of informality causes

_ those asking the librarian there questions to speak

aloud rather than in whispers.
If, you ‘have a compulsion to browse through
the books on the nearest shelf, rather than to mem-

A orize sines and cosines, seat yourself at:-ta desk in

where ‘books printed in Russian are kept. Unless

that’s your major, browsing time will be reduced. »
For those studying medieval customs or, literature,-

what place could be better than the Commons
Room where,one might expect to see an armored
knight come clanking down a corridor?

Other study spots which seem popular include

‘rooms where classes aren’t meeting, window ledges

and alcoves in the Cathedral, various corners in the
dormitories, all over the SU Lounge and, ‘to go back
For some
reason, not ‘everyone is hitting the;books at the

The Lake's Lure . ; ;

Angling Art

for V

The most famous sport ﬁsherman of all time,
Izaak Walton, once wrote, “As no man is born
an artist, so no man is born an angler.” He was
right in one sense. Fishing is almost an art in
itself. It requires a great deal of
practice, and knowledge of the
related ‘lpre comes only after re-
peated attempts. But still a ﬁsh-
erman must be a certain type of
person.‘ He must be an optimist
and he must possess almost in
finite patience. These things can’
come with practice, but they are
more a part of a per_son’s in-
grained personality.

To most people, a lake is a
lake is a lake, but to the angler
each lake has its own character. its own sentimen-
tal value. -Twist his arm with the proper pressure
and at the proper angle, and hewill ﬁsh in any
water -ho1e,'but he’ll mumble to himself that his
lake hasn’t got a ‘fourth of the weeds that this lake
has, or he's caught more fish in his lake than he"s
caught in all other places he’s ﬁshed combined. If
he catches enough ﬁsh, however, it’s a safewager
that he’ll soon stop mumbling. '

Old Renter

“Fisherman's Rendezvous — Boats for Hire,"
the sign at the lake says. .The guy who rents the
boats looks as if he had been around to witness

   

the formation of the lake, so he -must know it like ’

the back of his wizened hands. Then the inevitable
and traditional question and answer period:
“What’s runnin’ today?” _
“Everything.”
“Where‘s it runnin’?"
“Everywhere.” '
“»What’s best, live stuff or artiﬁcial?”
' “either.”

‘Well, thank God for rubber_boats. Our boy

might as well be riding the. Mississippi in a col- '

ander. And so, eyeing the coughing motor, the
leaking caulking, and the motor again, he throws
sporting spirit to the vultures and drops anchor
about 25 yards from the nearest fog—shrouded island.

Methodically, with a mother’s touch, the ﬁsher-A

man fuses rod and reel. He strings the thin nylon
ﬁlament through the eyelets, and, with a little
chortle, reaches for his tackle box. What the lamp
was for Alladin, the tackle box is for the angler.’
Take away his’ tackle “box and you might as well
snip out his pancreas, because a tackle box is ‘not
something that exists as is from the beginning. It

-grows; it’ is nursed and fed and it ‘grows. It is

added to_ bit‘ by bit, from the simplest number, six
hook to the scientifically sectioned, treble-barbed
mirro—1ure. Like a child at Christmas, the ﬁsher-
man stares with candy-cane eyes as he fondles the
latch and slowly opens the box. Instantly all the
spirit of optimism, exhilaration, ca__re-free exal-
tation permeate thedrnisty night air. There is a
total absence of any solidity as the fog envelopes
everything in a chilling caress and even the rod_
loses its" identity as it becomes a whipping, quiver-_
ing appendageof the ﬁsherman’s arm.
Cowardly Fog
The fog ‘turns yellow as dawn seeps into the
lake from over the surrounding‘ hills. The basset-
eyed angler admonishes the incipient sunlight and
mumbles some rather ungentlemanly adjectives at
the limp stringer trailing in-the water from the
oarlock.
‘ “Fish are only 1 . . ‘only ﬁsh," he hisses through
gritted teeth, and he reaches for another lure.
Well, the next lure,won’t catch anything either,
nor will the ones’ following. But he will sit for

four or five more hours cursing the lure manufac- ,

turers for knowing more about advertising than
ﬁshing, and"the Game Commission for notvkeéping

By JAY H. LEVJN

The pretender to the throne, Charles De Gaulle, has
really become a ‘thorn in our side. The popular belief that
the leaders of the Free World are buddy-buddies working
for the same cause has been debunked by De’ Gaulle more
than anyone else. He has dismayed, confused, and abashed
just about everyone in his sight. He is trying his darndest
to destroy NATO and President Kennedy’s hope for an
Atlantic Community. ‘His most ridiculously awesome feat
is the recent ﬁasco he caused in the Common Market.

In 1821 the third edition of David Ricardo’s The Prin-
ciples of Political Economy and,Taxation was published.

' In it the distinguished classical economist postulated what

is known today as the principle of comparative advantage.
Stripped of all details, it basically argues that the greater
the trade area, the more will be the beneﬁts for the coun-

[tries within that area. President De‘ Gaulle doesn’t believe

it, or atleast he’s action as if he doesn’t.'iVVith one swipe of
his lanky arm he has eliminated Great Britain from the
privileged minority. Moreover, he has eradicated economic
‘advantages that would have accrued _to.his own country,
whose prosperity he presumably champions.

Actually, his recent actioniis motivated by political sel-
fishness, which, aside from his own viewpoint, is also irra-
tional. This action has demonstrated that the Common

itually become .a magniﬁed France.

Market is not a harmonious institution seeking common
economic gain, ‘but a confederation of states, at least one of
which is prompted by pure self-interest. This self-interest is
embodied in the midn of" Charles de Gaulle, who is using

the Common Market as a tool to attain the "quixotic goal of ,

a politically non-dependent European continent with him-
self at the helm. Simply stated, Europe to him will even-
But the squabbling
among the Common Market members bears witness that
political uniﬁcation of Europe is impossible. Much of it has
been fomented by De Gaulle himself. Moreover, if he,act-
ually is striving for apolitical organization, he obviously
feels that Great Britain is politically unqualiﬁed, as op-
posed _to his own, country, of which he is virtually dictator.

If'De Gaulle can’t reach his dream, at least he’ll settle
for a confederation of «states led‘ by‘ Charles De Gaulle.
Probably this is what the man really wants. ‘The latest joke
about De Gaulle is that he said in prayer, “Almighty God,
have conﬁdence in me.” 0

An Economics senior, Jay H. Levin toured France this
summer. where he found “that the people of France are
being deluded by De Gaulle. My concern is for the Common
Market which he is trying to destroy.” Levin is assistant

Sees Greatest Threat in Racial Slaughter

AP Expert Discusses Africa

By NANCY FUCHS

“Africa at the moment is in
a monumental mess,” stated
Lynn Heinzerling. The As-
sociated Press’s “top African
expert and roving correspon-
dent,” in his talk on “African
Born to Trouble” at Wednesday’s
Midday Series.

Heinzerling went on to say
that Africa is “divided.by tri-
balism, discouraged by poverty,
and held back by ignorance. Ra-
cial slaughter in South Africa is
the continent’s supreme threat;
the rest is a political vacuum.”

One-ﬁfth Earth’s Land

Africa is three times the size
of the United States with one-
fifth the world’s land surface. Be-
low the Sahara there are 200 mil-
lion people in over 700 tribes. Af-
ter World War II, there were
only four independent nations.
Today, 33 countries have re-
ceived independence. The problem
is that there_ are not enough
skilled and educated leaders and
teachers. .

The literacy rate below the
Sahara is between ten and 20
per cent. Heinzerling noted that
even Uganda, having recently
received its independence for
which it was well-prepared, has
less than 25 per cent of its chil-
dren in school. “Education alone
could exhaust the budget of any
country such as Uganda,” con-
tinued Heinzerling.

In the Congo, which was run
under Belgian rule “more as a
business than a country,” no
Congolese was permitted to hold
a position above that of clerk,"
Heinzerling explained.

Most Pampered

He feels, however, that “the

.Congolese were perhaps the most

pampered /Africans because the
Belgians provided them with an
excellent public health system,
fairly good urban housing, and
a good primary education Sys-
term.”

In the late ﬁfties, two univer-
sities were opened . More Con-
golese than ever are studying
in Belgium today.

Patrice Lumumba, the Republic
of the Congo’s first prime minis-

ter, was a‘ postal clerk and beer

salesman. “He was unable to run
the country as itshould be run.
This was his opportunity to en-

trench himself in power,” Hein-

zerling continued. “Administra-
tors, not orators, are needed.”
Nyasaland

Nyasaland, a country of three
million people, has only three
doctors and 16 qualiﬁed teach-
ers. Nigeria, under Abubakar Ba-
lewa, “the most outstanding At’-
rican leader,” according to Hein-
zerling, has several thousand col-
lege graduates, but the per cap-
ita annual income is $85, com-
pared to $2400 in America.

“PERIOD OF
ADJUSTMENT"

COMING
“IF A MAN ANSWERS"

In South Africa the biggest
problem is racial prejudice. The
aim of Apartheid, the South Af-
rican term for complete segrega-
tion, is to get as many Negroes as
possible into seven or eight re-
serves in the country. Now they
can not vote or own land. They
are banned from all athletic com-
petition with white athletes, and
may not even use elevators.

‘ Cheap Labor

Many of them are used as a
cheap source of labor in the gold
mines. “They are not permitted
to strike, for a strike would com-
pletely paralyze South Africa,”
explained Heinzerling.

“Since the whites are outnum-
bered by 11 million, many do
not understand why the Negroes
do not shout, ‘One man, one
vote,’ and move into power,”
Heinzerling remarked.

“But the South African police
force is the most effective on the
continent and the Negroes know
they are not yet ready to as-
sume the difﬁcult job of govern-

“A new upper class is rising
to take the place of the Euro-

pean colonists, but it is unfor- ing their country,” answered
tunately determined not by ser- HeinZeI‘1ing-
vice to the country, but by the Heinzerling concluded that

ruling political party.

“And when you have a na-
tion such as the Congo with
over 200 tribes speaking 74 lan-
guages and dialects differing as
much as French and English,
it will be the bulk of the cen-
tury before Africans‘ will trans-
fer their loyalty from tribe to
nation,” Heinzerling predicted.

cide whether her worth as an ally
outweighs the embarrassment of
Apartheid.”

Pioneer Efforts
Win Metallurgist
Grad an Award.

Edward,J. Ostrowski, super-
visor of the Process metallurgy
research division of the National
Steel Corporation was named. the
1963 recipient or the J. E. John-
son, Jr.,A Award of the. American
Institute of Mining, Metallurgical,
and Petroleum Engineers.

Ostrowski received his metal-
lurgical engineering degree at the
University. Wartime Marine
Corp, service interrupted his work
with Follansbee Steel Coropora-
tion in Toroneo, Ohio. On his re-
turn to the company, he rose to
the chief observer of open
hearths. ' '.

‘ He left Follansbee to join the
Bureau of-Mines in Pittsburgh,
becoming supervising production
metallurgist and the project lead-
er of blast furnace research. In

1960, Ostrowski went to the Na-‘

tional Steel Corporation.
Ostrowski was nominated for
the award by the Iron and: Steel
Division of the Meatllurgical So-
ciety. The‘ committee says he_-was
named “for pioneering efforts in
the design, construction, and op-
eration of small scale experimen-
tal blast furnaces’ and -in the de-
velopment of practices utilizing

auxiliary. injected “fuels and high’

blast temperatures.” .
The award will be presented to
Mr. Ostrowski at the Annual Din-

ner of The Metallurgical S.ociety,_;
‘February 26 in Dallas, ‘Texas.

 

 

Bebko Named    
IF C President
In ‘Upset’

(Continued from Page 1)
Zacher was nominated‘ by Dave
Harding just prior to the vote.

In the three other electoral
post contests, Jack Cory of Delta
Tau Delta won the’ treasurer’s
position -over Martin Kraus of
Zeta Beta Tau. Chuck, Gallar-
son of Sigma Alpha Epsilon won
a majority vote on the ﬁrst,bal-
lot to defeat Hank Baumberger
of Delta Sigma Phi and Howard
Patterson of Sigma Phi Epsilon
for the secretarial position.

A double vote, however, was
necessary to elect Warren. Cohen
ﬁfth man over Phi Kappa Theta’s
Dave Harding and Pi Kappa Al-
pha’s Jim Mastrian. Neither Hard-
ing or Cohen received a majority
on the first ballot, and Jim Mas-
trian, as thecandidate receiving
the lowest number of. votes, was
dropped on the second vote.

‘ Previously Declined.

Cohen had previously. declined
nominations to run for treasurer
and’ secretary in order to run for
ﬁfth man and had actually made
the nominating speech for Cory in
the treasurer race.

Candidates _ for all positions
,were permitted nominating and
seconding speeches, but while
Bebko received both, no one
offered a seconding 'speech for
Fox. '

The. presidential candidates,

however, were _permitted extra"

time during which they could
state their goals for IFC. The
ideas put forth by the candidates
were intrinsically the same,
though Bebko announced his in-
tention of limiting future council
meetings to times when they are
needed and not necessarily every
other week. »

Review of “Ideas and Figures”

Imagery Too Much

ln. Fiction and Poetry

By JOSEY GROSSMAN
The winter edition of Ideas and Figures overshadows cer-

tain pieces oi fiction and poetry of deﬁnite mood and fresh
,description with prime examples of over-bearing imagery
' and pseudo—sophist.ication.
Baymer Gorr’s “The Pile of Rocks” well deserves _its lead ,

position. Fresh description and dialogue develop a small

emotional
sal irony of the regression of old‘
age. The natural description.l
faintly reminiscent of Steinbeck
but perhaps only because of ‘the
mouse. molds a story of delicate
emotion \vitho'ut sentimentality.
Gorr maintains a light suspense,
perhaps better classified as curi-
osity. which he fulfills at the peak;
of the readers‘ interest. The be-‘
ginning‘ descriptive details are re-
ferred to at the end. further ty-

description puts across the
pseudo-sophistication of a l5-

Seventeen, is the plot: the harsh
development of maturity
enough.

But Tanski's effect. both emo-

ineffective, and done with a

by an overall mood. The emotion-

father, are over-burdened
nile feelings.
“Summer" Not So Hot

Gretchen Dihoﬁ"s sketch of
‘fSummer" is i.ot original, not de-
veloped, and certainly would re-
quire more thought as to indi-
vidual character to -salvage the
quality of the stereotyped theme.

Laura Wicinas has overburd-

“Small Town — \~Vorld Vt-'ar II"
with heavy sentimental descrip-
tion. In the last piece of fiction .
Annamae Pavlosky has treated
an equally emotional situation
with her fresh dialogue and
train-of-thought c r ‘e a t in g a
‘strong impact.

The poetry on the whole is good’.
Ed Roberson’s “Poem" is the most
powerful in its frankness and con-

also be noted for its delicacy of
imagery. Lastly, Anne Fertik’s

pecially in “Andy,”.elTective word

Dr. Barbara M. McIntyre. Di-
rector of the Children’s Thearc
Division of the University Thea-
tre, recently announced an orig-
inal children's play, The Hundred
Dresses. will be performed in the
Pittsburgh area during February
?and March.

The play is based on the short
i children’s novel of the same name
3 by Eleanor Estes and was adapted
by William Kingsley.

Kingsley is a graduate student
in the department of Speech and

play. Assisting him in this un-
,dertaking will ‘be Ann True and
'Janice Weidner, who are acting
as co-directors.
Little Experience

Junior _high school children ex-
clusivcly will do the acting and
producing. Dr. Mclntyre pointed
out that the only previous ex-

in theatre has been in" Creative
Dramatics. .

She further emphasized that
the introduction of. these chil-
dren to a full-ﬂedged, formal-
theatre experience complete
with s'ets, lighting and sound ~
would be, therefore, a unique
experience for them as well as
an unusual experiment in chil-

UNSYMPATHETIC scoreboard disillusions Panthers.

-Frank 0 ’Korn Key

T 0 16-10 Mat Victory

By BOB SMIZIKV

Coach Rex Perry’s sophomore loaded wrestling team, all
but counted out as a wrestling power for the 1963 season,
scored its second win of the season over one of the country’s
top ten teams, as they scored a convincing 16-10 win over
Michi_gan State Saturday at East/ Lansing, Michigan.

The win was doubly impressive for the Panthers since

the Spartans had lost by only one‘

point to the nation’s top-ranked
team, Oklahoma. Oklahoma, how-
ever, had lost some of its luster
due to an early season loss to
Oklahoma State.

The win was still the most im-

:*'portant of the season for the Pan-

thers who ,now
own a 4-2 re-

cord.

_ It. was 147-
pounder Frank
O’Korn, f o r-
merly a weak

Panther lineup,
who posted the
big win of the
day that sent

5-5 score. '
O’Korn didlnot let his team
down as he beat favored Monty
Byington, a junior letterman, 3-1,

"for his second straight win after

four earlier losses.
True to Form
The win was important as ex-
pected as the Panthers took the
next two matches, the‘Spartans
the next and the fourth ending in
a tie. Without ,O’Korn’s win the
match would_ have ended in a tie.
John Carr and Jim Harrison
were true to form in the follow-
ing ‘matches "as Carr dow_ned

Harrison kept his record at a

near-perfect 5-0-1 to clinch
the match.

The story-book ending of
the basketball team and‘ the
Frank Merriwell heroics of
guard Dave" Roman shattered
witha referee’s whistle Sat-
urday night as the. Panthers
lost to West Virginia, 68-67.

Roman, who scored 18 points
in the second half and 20 in_ the
game, hit a 40-foot jump shot
with a second remaining that ap-
peared to give the Panthers la 69-
68 win. The shot was disallowed,
however, because co-captain Ben

Jinks had called time-out under
orders from Coach Bob Timmons.

Guard‘Tim Grgurich had passed I

the ball inbounds to Roman with

Useless March
As Roman’s long desperation
attempt swirled through the net
and hundreds of students dashed
onto the court to hoist him in a
victory march, only referee Jack
O’Rourke and Jinks knew that
a fairy-tale had been exposed.
.“We had to call time to get
the one shot,” Timmons ex-
plained. “This was justone of
those times when things didn’t
work out. The onethat doesn’t
count goes in, and the the one
that counts doesn’t.” ,
Timmons wished to retreat
further back into the game to
explain the loss. “We got in foul

trouble early again,” he said.

‘I Going for Pins

’, By BOB SMIZIK

A wrestling record of 4-2
normally is not much cause
for excitement, but the Pan-
ther’s 157-pounder, J ohnvCarr,
has compiled such a record

1 and still has managed to
as avid a following as any wres-
tler here.

Even the sensational sophomore
Mike Johnson has not managed to
bypass Carr as far as popularity
with the wrestling fans is con-
cerned. The reason for Carr’s ac-
ceptance is his aggressive wres-
tling style.

Carr is not of the typical mold.
Panther Coach Rex Peery teaches
a conservative style of wrestling.
It's all right to go for the pin in
Peery’s style, just so long as there
is no chance of giving up a point
in the process. Syracuse Coach
Joe Scandura summed it up by
saying, “Pit plays the point.”

Exception to Rule

. But Carr, a 20-year old soph-
omore from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., is
the exception to this rule. He has
I ' a variety of pinning combinations
and is not afraid to use them at
_ the earliest opportunity, regard"-

' less of the consequences.
"f" This was plainly evident in

-his first two matches. Against

. 'Michigan’s Dave Post, Carr

 scored a pin ‘early in the sec-

’ ond period with a bar-arm and
half-nelson.

The same strategy backfired
against .Virgil Carr of Iowa State,
because unfortunately for John
“Carr, Post is not in the same class
with Virgil Carr.

Went too Soon

“I learned a lot against Vir-
gil,” says John. “I went for the
pin too soon and got tired. You

“Carr is a good tough kid,” said
Alitz. “He and Johnson are Pitt’s

dangerously close to pinning Nat-

Wrestling against the like of
Virgil Carr and Natvig is typical
of the competition C'arr will have
to face. The Panther’s 157-pound-

four matches. One was a Na-
tional champion, two were to Na-_

to a Big Ten title-holder. .,

“If Pendleton throws me around I

him a good match, win or lose,
then I’ll try him again in the
Easterns. Of course, all of this
depends on what the Coach wants

‘me to do.”

The thing Peery wants Cart; to
do most is to continue wrestling
the way he has, for he is rapidly
becoming the best 157-pounder

THE CURSE ‘OF THE CAMEUS: NO. 1

I Hate me if you will, but I must speak. We college types are

far too complacent. Sure, We’ve got plenty to be proud of.
We’ve got atom smashers, we’ve got graduate schools, we've got
new peaks in scholarship, new highs in academic honors. And yet,
in the midst of these triumphs, we have failed disma.lly to make
any progress in solving the oldest and most horrendous of all
campus problems: we’ve still got roommat-es.

I To be sure, all roommates are not bad. There is the well-
documented case of Hilquit Glebe, a student at the M a.nha.t-tan
College of Agricult-ure, majoring in curds andwhey, who ad-
mitted publicly that he actually llked his roommate-—a.n odd
admission when you consider that this roommate, Mervis
Trunz by name, was frankly not too Winsome a. fellow. He
practiced his tympani in his room, he kept an alligator, and he
collected airplane tires. .

But, on the other hand,‘ Mervis bought two packs of Marlboro
Cigarettes every day and gave one of them to Hilquit and—I ask

. you—who can stay mad at a man who gives you l\'la.rIbo1'o

Cigarettes? VVho', upon tasting that flavorful blend of Marlboro

tobaccos, upon drawing through that purewhite Marlboro ﬁlter, _

upon exulting in this best of all possible cigarettes, Mai-lI)oro-—
who, I say, can harden his heart against his neighbor? Certainly
not Hilquit. Certainly not I. Certainly not you, as you will ﬁnd
when you scurry to your nearest tobacconist and buy a supply.
M arlboros come in soft pack or Flip-Top Box. Tobacconists
come in small, medium, and large.

     

 

  

’_.

But I digress. Roommates, I say, are still with us and I
fear they always will be, so we better learn how to get along
with them. It can be done, you know. Take, for instaiice, the
classic case of l)olly Pitcher and Molly Madison.

Dolly and'Molly, roommates at a prominent Midwestern

girls’ school (Vassar) had a problem that seemed insoluble. Dolly :

could only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake
past nine o'clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too
bright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the
room was too dark for Dolly t-o study. What to do‘?

Well sir, those two intelligent American kids found an an-
swer. They got 9. miner's cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough .
light to study by, and still the room was dark enough for
Molly to sleep.

It must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious
as it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got so en-
chanted with her miner's cap that she switched her major from
18th Century poetry to mining and met-allurgy. Shortly after
graduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:
while out prospecting, she discovered what is without question
_the world's largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly
very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for
feldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre
living making echoes for tourists in l\/Iamm’otl1 Cave.

Nor has Molly lured conspicuously better. Once Dolly got
the miners hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost
sleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous-—more
vigoimis, alas, than she realized. .It was the afternoon of the
annual l)ean’s tea. Molly stood in line with her classmates,

The Delta Sigs started their
second unit in a conﬁdent gesture,
but
only a 9-6 advantage. In came

Delta Sigs rolled to an easy 21-12
hali't.ime lead. as the football end

The Hungry Eight held Lou
S]-aby to eight points after he had
hit 48 a week ago, but the Buck-
eyes still streaked to their second
straight win, 68-52. Jim Traﬁcant
scored 16 points for the winners.

Buckeyes Too Strong

Art Schake, who led‘ the losers
with 15 points, caught the full im-
pact of a Slaby-thrown elbow and
suffered a broken nose and ten
minutes of uninterrupted sleep.
The game, according .to Director
Ed McFarland “got a little out of
hand.”

Apartment “C” (2-0), a slick-
moving outﬁt which prepped at
Johnstown College, opened in a
full court press and stole the ball
often enough to squelch The Pitt
News, 22-2, at the outset.

Sparked b_y Ron Clawson with
27 and John Carlisle, a pitcher on
the baseballteam, with 15, they

ran up a 83-33 win. The losers re- '

Result: "Cushion Recoil” provides a
dramatically smoother ride

in 1963 Ford-built cars

The challenge given Ford engineers was to design suspensions
that would permit wheels virtually to roll with the punches-not
only in a vertical plane but fore-and-aft as well. Conventional
suspension systems provide only a partial solution to road shocks

by limiting wheel recoil to an up-and-down motion.

The solution? Exclusive Cushion Recoil suspension design in all
Fordbuilt cars for 763! Cushion Recoil, with cushioning action
in a fore-and-aft plane as well as vertical, smothers the jars and

on deeply rutted roads you experience better control of the car.
Furthermore, your Ford-built car is spared the wear and tear of

road-induced vibration.

ing excellence at Ford and new ideas for the American Road.

Donald Fink, an economic con-
sultant for the Organization of
American States, heard the group
in Columbia andsuggested a‘ con-
cert visit to Pittsburgh.

‘ Commies Upset

_According to Fink, “The Com-
munists are already very upset
over this project. It has proven
very hard to cope with because
the United States Government had
nothing to do with the idea.”

Larry A. Heller, director of
Student Union activities, and
Marilyn Eiges, chairman_ of’ the
PM Series committee, made ar-
rangements for the group’s ap-
pearance- at the University.

According to Heller, “There is
a «possibility of a White House
Kennedy,
and also a performance in front

of the,_United Nations.”

The group will open their Pitts-
burgh concert schedule on Tues-
