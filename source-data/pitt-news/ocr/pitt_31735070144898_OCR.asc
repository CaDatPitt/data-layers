Former linebacker Scott McKillop
When the NFL. Draft takes

place April_25—26, Pitt linebacker .

Scott McKillop won’t be too‘ far
from the college that turned him
intoan NFL prospect.

“I’ll be with my lfamily,” said
McKillop, a Pittsburgh native. “If
something good happens, I want to
be here to share it with them.’."

McKillop, who earned the 2008
Big East defensive player of the
year award in his final year at Pitt,
is coming off the best season of
his college career. S ‘

. Along with teammate running
back LeSean McCoy, McKillop is
projected by many scouting Web
sites to make it in the NFL.

But even good projections don’t
take away the stress of being an
NFL prospect.

“It can be a scary two days,”
said McKillop of " the Draft. “But
all it takes is one team to really like
you and there you are.”

 Donate, don’t ditch I

used furniture

‘ It’s that time of the year. Finals
 week is quickly approaching, caps
 and gowns are being ﬁtted for gradu-
 ation, and students living off campus
 are writing their ﬁnal rent checks.
E For thoseleaving their apartments
 or houses, they also have the whole
 moving—out project to anticipate.

I But even after all the boxes and
 suitcases are stuffed with clothes,
 tableware, DVDs and all other
 knickknacks, there remains another
 dilemma: what to do with all the fur-
 niture.

_ Your average desk, dresser or
 coffee table is too cumbersome to

 ﬁt in an already crammed van or ‘

 car. Most students leaving their off-
? campus abodes must leave these
 items behind. And although some
 willdragtheirﬁirnituretothecurb to
 be picked up with the trash, students
 shouldn’t forget their alternatives.

' The Oakland Planning and De-

~ velopment Corporation already has

 a viable solution. From the end of
 April to the middle of August, the
 OPDC will collect usedfurniture to
 resell to students in the fall.

I Unless that kitchen table of yours

 is missing a leg or that lamp refuses to -

 light, students should take advantage
 of donating their used —— but not
 broken —— furniture to the OPDC’s
 program. For students scrounging for
 items to furnish their new residences
in the fall, they’ll at least have the

§ option to buy lower~priced furniture A

 that’s still in decent condition. The

 OPDC had a selection of about 350

 items in decent condition last year.
Of course, there’s always the

prospect of selling your furniture-j
or  it to a fiiend. Both of these 
solutions are practical, too. No matter 
how students recycle their furniture, 
it beats the alternative: sending per- 
fectly usable" goods to a landﬁll. - A

At the very least, one could al— 
ways. tack a “Free” or “Take Me” 
‘sign to that couch or nightstarid be— 
fore dragging it to the street; But if 
that’s the situation, why not donate 
it to OPDC’s Furniture Recycling

Oakland’s streets aren’t exactly lit— 
ter free, and they certainly don’t need 

i more items clogging up sidewalks 

or potentially becoming litter. Also, 

these items deﬁnitely won’t be "much  ’

good to anyone if they’re thrown in 
a landﬁll. 
- The accessibility of the OPDC’s 

‘program is  the more timely and 
‘applicable in light of the recently 

instated ban of couches on porch— 
cs. OPDC has made it clear that it 
doesn’t want couches that have suf— 
fered weather damage or are infested 
with rodents or insects, but the cor— 
poration' will take them otherwise.
Really, the responsibility lies in 
students’ hands. :
.While it’s easier just to toss ev- 
erything onto the street, the beneﬁt 
for future students ‘outweighs the 
slight efforts on part of the students 
moving out i
Selling one’s furniture can be as 
simple as a quick online listing, and’ 
donating to OPDC is as easy as tak— 
ing goods to its office or  its 
volunteers a phone call to have them

I was watching “Knocked Up” on
Friday, and my friend Andromedon
got upset when he found out the
 characters were only 23.

‘”That’s only a year older than us!”
he said. “\We’re old.” ' ‘

I am pretty old, for college. And
I’m staying a ﬁfth year to do a bach-
elor’s of philosophy about conges-
tion pricing. By September, I’ll have

3 a whole ﬁve years on some of my

classmates. V ~

I can ﬁght it, of course. If I shave,
1 look about 20, like in my Pitt.News
photo. I have an Alabama license; so

 
 

I could hang out with sophomores '

and say, “Check out my fake. It says
I’m from Alabama and like 23!”

However, getting older hasn’t
been so bad. Pros:

1. You don’t feeltlame and bored
as often.

_ When I was youngeﬁif I stayed
in for a weekend, I would fall into a
morose conviction that my existence
was bland and sterile. Life was pass-

  me by. If I watched a movie with

characters my age doing something

 exciting, I felt threatened, like I was

missing out; It doesn’t help that most

advertising is designed to make you

feel this way. i '\
Nowadays, what I View as my

I present life extends further into the

past and future. If  don’t pan

nourishment from how two weeks
back my friends visited from New
Orleans and I played in a,Kelly Clark-

 son cover band. And this summer,

I’m going to Colombia. With this
peace of mind, I can legitimately
relax on a Friday night once in a

2. You have a higher pain toler-
ance.

One day when'I was a kid, my dad ‘

cut his arm with the hedge trimmer
and bled all over the place. Then he
bandaged up, applied some Neo-
sporin and inside of ﬁve minutes he
was watching “Shawshank Redemp-
tion” and eating a Popsicle happy as
could be. I thought my dad was some
sort of Zen master, impervious to
suffering. ,

Now, I .understand: as you age,
pain gets less painful. Or, it hurts the

same, but it’s just not as distressing.
You don’t care. I dealt with a slipped

< \

disk last week — a very old-people

ailment —— and I just thought, “Hell,
at least it’s not- appendicitis again.”

. Even if I got appendicitis today, I

would take comfort in the idea that,
useless and dangerous as it is, the

appendix has the courtesy to make‘

a clean exit whenrthe bell tolls.

,/ 3. You know what you’re bad
at. _ .
Although for some reason the

education system tells you otherwise,
you’re mediocre or awful at 80 per-
cent of the activities that can be un-
dertaken. Knowing what you’re bad

i at is at least as important as knowing

what you’re good at. You save time
and ﬁtustration. It’s also just comfort-
ing to prunethe possibility tree of
what you can reasonably accomplish,
so you don’t fret so much over what
to do.
This knowledge comes hard,
‘though. Only after years of failure
and trying your best do you realize
what you’re not cut out for. Every
day, you can meet the morning sun
boldly asking, “What will I screw up
today?” And, with perspective,’ the
answer can make you laugh.
4. You can appreciate pop mu-
sic.
When I was 10, we had this social
studies project where we played our

favorite song for the class. I played.

“Ml\/ﬂ\/[Bop” by Hanson. Then I
became a teenager and listened to

punk, indie and underground rap.

j _’ Now, although I’m no Fonzie,‘
I’m comfortable at my current level

of cool. So, I can splurge a little of
my accumulated cool and learn all

‘ the words to a Shakira song without

_ feeling  After all, I’m going
to Colombia  where Shakira is
from!

Getting older isn’t all fun and
games, though. Cons:

1. You and your friends aren’t as I

furmy. _ ‘

When people age, they develop
a ubiquitousiunease about tasks left
undone and decisions left unmade.
Consequently, everyone’s sense of
humor deteriorates. You’ll ﬁnd your-

‘ self forcing laughs around folks your

Letterstotheeditor

To the Editor,

ThePitt News’ April 8 editorial on same-
sex marriage demonstrates some glaring mis-
conceptions. _

The concept of discrimination no more

~ applies to sexual orientation in the case of ‘

marriage than it does any of the numerous
inherent disqualiﬁers in the case of eligibility
to‘ serve in the military. A .
The idea that marriage, as a civil institu—.
tion, is about ﬁnding the person you love is a

H peculiar modern rationalization lacking both

historic standing and logic. It serves no beneﬁt
to society, to confer upon a couple the status
of marriage under legal-recognition unless
there’s something that the relationship can
offer society; namely, procreation. '
Marriage has always been a mechanism

' for society to encourage its members to pro-

create, because societies recognize the need
to procreate  order to survive. That’s why

A while societies have embraced such harmful

variations as plural marriage and underage
marriage 4 each of which were mainly deter-
mined by.factors such as life expectancy and
infant mortality rate —— few societies have, in

the historic context, embraced extending the
status of marriage to same—sex couples.
The pro—homosexual marriage movement
has largely lost itself in empty emotional
rhetoric. Homophobia is real and needs to
be overcome, but it is not homophobic by
and of itself to oppose gay marriage.
Already, many states havelaws enabling
same—sex couples to receive the beneﬁts that
they are legitimately concerned about being
denied. These include hospital visitation and
inheritance issues. It is entirely humane and

just to ensure that same—sex couples are not‘

denied these beneﬁts, but these matters can
be separated entirely from the larger debate
over marriage. ' ' -

I hope that gay couples can enjoy long
and happy relationships in every state of our
great nation. I just don’t think it’s best for

us to change our fundamental concept of .

what marriage const:‘itutes.vIf the two sides to
the debate fail to respect one another, then
something major is lost in the realmof public

discourse.

Steve Kaszycki -- .
School of Arts and Sciences

To the Editor,

The Wednesday April 8 editorial makes
the argument that legalizing same—sex mar-

riage ‘is a step toward equal rights for gays.

The problem is, however, that marriageis
not, and never was, a right. _

. The biggest problem I have with the edi-
torial reflects the error so commonly made
by the’left.\They alwaysbelieve in “progress.”

,— But who decides that gay marriage shows

progress? Some argue that gay marriage

erodes the already dying traditional. family.

Change does not always equal progress. At
a point in history, the forced migration of
12 million Africans from their homeland to
America supposedly signiﬁed progress. -

, Evidently, presentday views-of what is

or is not progress differs from person to
person, and therefore they are irrelevant.
The only true evaluator’ of progress is his-

tory, and history makes its judgment only '

after the effects of the actions are felt.

Czech It
SPACE Gallery
812 Liberty Ave., Downtown
Through May 23

A small group of people met‘ in
.downtownPittsburghin1918todiscuss
the creation of anindependent country

set to be called Czechoslovakia."Ihe A ~

meeting proved successful, and because
of the declaration’s local roots, it has
since been known as the “Pittsburgh
Agreement” R

With this historical relevance as a

backdrop, SPACE Gallery, a building
that sits just blocks away from where

' _the‘‘PittsburghAgreement’’was

has opened a new exhibit titled ‘ ‘Czech
It.” The exhibit showcases ll photog-
raphers, each representing one of three

, generations that have seen a different

side of the country that  now called
the Czech Republic

jen Saffron, co—curator of “Czech
It,” was inspired to bring the Czech .

Republic to a Pittsburgh audience partly
because of its historical context, but also
because of the Czech photographers

- sheharl met in the past.

Saifron studied underjindrich Streit,
one of the big name Czech artists show-
cased at thegallery. Also during that
time, she brieﬂy visited with Antonin
Dufek, a well-known writer and histo-
rian of Czech photography. _

“Since then, I’ve had a vision to bring
this photography to Pittsburgh [Avant—

but it’s little knowninthe U.S.” .

Avant-garde is not the only style of-

fered in “Czech It,” though. The focus

is inoreon the evolution of a country

photographs range from the 19205

. to "present, placing a spotlight on the

impact of political  within the

 

zeched out

country'— from a  of war and
socialoppression to a time of ﬁreedom
“brought forth by the Czech Republic’s
Velvet Revolution. '

According to Saffron, the country’s
deterioration and eventualrebirth and
the transcendence of photography
through all of it is something worth
taking a second look at ,

“I think it’s important to recognize
the heritage — what they do now and

what they did in the past,” she said. “I '

wanted to showcase great photogra-

.  but also how photographers in a

country with such an  political
history have responded to social an
political concerns” ~

The work of Streit, which docu-
ments the struggles of rural villagers,
was once censored by the government
forits content: His black—and—white
photographs of ‘people  in pov-
erty reveal a harsh reality that existed
before the -revolution. In “Sovinec,”
Streit depicts a human contentment in
these sad conditions Two women stand
smiling, cloaked from head to toe in
furs, in frontia ramshackle house.

In contrast, the colorﬁil portraits by
Evzen Sobek, entitled “Life in Blue,”
show individuals exempt from politi-
cal oppression. Smiling faces, rounded
