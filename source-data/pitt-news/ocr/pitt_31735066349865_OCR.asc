News Editor

Chancellor Posvar has announc-
ed the temporary transferral of
four student services from the
Office of Student Affairs to other
areas. The Housing Office. which
includes the Food Service, has
been moved to the Office of Oper-
ations, while the Office of Admis-
sions and Student Aid has been
placed under the Provost.

The offices will be relocated on
a trial basis, pending the report
of the Student Affairs Task Force
to the Chancellor.

The Task Force is a group of ad-
ministrators and student leaders
appointed this summer to investi-

. gate the roles and functions of Stu-

dent Affairs. They are asking
whether there is really a need for
an Office of Student Affairs.

“There’s a tentative feeling that
there’s a very good case for as-
signing these two areas else-
where,” the Chancellor said of the
transferrals. “It’s an excellent
idea to assign both of these func-
tions on a trial basis; it will aid
the committee.”

He noted that these two moves
take some of the pressures off
Kobosky, who is concurrently
handling the functions of two of-
fices, Public Affairs and Student
Affairs.

Posvar said that the Vice Chan-
cellor for Operations, Joseph Dut-
ton, had experience in housing and
food service before coming to Pitt,
and that Provost Rhoten Smith,
former president of Northern Illi-
nois University, is also fully com-

" petent in handling admissions and

student aid.

The Chancellor said he willltry
to temporarily appoint someone
as special _assistant to Vice

Chancellor for Student Affairs
Kobosky in an additional attempt
to lighten Kobosky’s workload.
Posvar has asked the Task Force
to submit a list of potential ap-
pointees to him.

Associate Provost Donald Hen-
derson, one of two vice chairmen
of the Task Force, said the group
will submit its list of nominations
to the Chancellor early this week.
He said the names would be of
people from within the Universi-
ty and indicated he was hopeful
the interim position would be fill-
ed by a woman.

-Meanwhile Henderson said the
committee has already come to
the conclusion that there really is
a need for such an office as Stu-
dent Affairs, though Student Af-
fairsmight be a misnomer.

‘‘It’s clear,’’ he said, “there are
a sizeable number of activities
that cannot be performed in any
other structure of the Universi-
sity.”

But Henderson added that the
Task Force is examining all of
Student Affairs’ functions to see
if it would make “sense to spin

some of them off to another of-

fice” as has been done experimen-
tally with Housing and Food and
Admissions and Student Aid.

One member has alsoproposed
relieving the Chancellor of direct
responsibility for intercollegiate
athletics.

Also under examination is the
actual need for a Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs. The Task
Force will consider such alterna-
tives as placing the remaining
Student Affairs divisions under
the Provost or the Vice Chancel-
lor for Public Affairs.

Henderson said the committee
hopes to complete its work during
the fall term.

Ends Funding Freeze

SA Slates Constitutional Review 

by SUE HOENSTINE

Eleven members of the Student
Association agreed Thursday eve-
ning to a Constitutional review
and ended the freeze on funding to
student organizations.

The agreement was reached at
an open meeting called by the SA
Commissioners and Allocations
Committee to discuss structural

-problems. The meeting drew an

audience of only two students.

A statement signed by Dennis
Concilla, Program Commission-
er; Wade Lawson, ‘Committees

/ Commissioner; Lenny Klavonic,

Social Commissioner; members
of the Social Commission, and the
Allocations Committee recom-
mended “the immediate appoint-
ment of a Constitutional review
committee to investigate amend-
ing or altering the present docu-
ment in the best interests of the
students.”

The statement also proposed’

committee membership “repre-

 

sentative of the broadest spec-
trum of campus interests” and
requested public hearings to pro-
duce recommendations on consti-
tutional reform for a student ref-
erendum by November 16, 1971.

During most of the two and one-
half hour session Concilla, Klav-
onic, and members of the Alloca-
tions Committee argued over bud-
getary power.

John _Kolb_ of ‘the Allocations
Committee questioned the Com-
missioners’ power to override
Allocations and said: “There’s no
point in a Constitution where four
commissioners can get together

. and get things through.”

' Programs Commissioner ' Den-
nis Concilla predicted that by next
November we will have a new
Constitution” and reminded the
Allocations Committee that their
committee “is a subcommittee of
the ‘Student Association.”

sioners) have the power tovote

 

 Szabo Food Inspires

by STEVE LUBETSKY

If Saga Food Service stirred
discontent, Szabo, introduced dur-
ing the summer, could conceiv-
ably breed revolt.

An informal Pitt News survey
suggests students are enraged
about Saturday luncheon sched-

  

    

ule which closes the cafeteria at
12:30 p.m. (one-half hour ear-
lier than Saga closed it last year),
and about Sunday brunches which
no longer include breakfast food.
Students have also complained
about the quality of the meals.

chology major, misses her lunch
every Saturday. “I don’t get up
that early,” she complained. She
further criticized the turkey din-
ners on Sundays and “cold cuts
for supper, served. buffet lunch-
eon style.

Another said she “has never
been to a Saturday lunch,” ‘since
she is sleeping at that time. She
swore that she had “ptomaine
poisoning” the other night and
described the caliber of food as
“very low grade.”

One student said that Sunday
brunches “should include eggs
and_ cereal” rather than turkey.
She added that she would prefer
“more variety.”

A student who used the cafe-
teria on weekends during the sum-
mer called the full course meal on
Sundays “absurd.” And another
complained that “it’s silly to roll
out of bed and into dinner.”

According to one disgruntled
diner, “Saga and Szabo ‘arebas-
ically the same, but Szabo pre-

pares food differently,” and em- i

phasized that “it’s the difference
that [don’t Iike.”‘

Comments concerning the Hunt _ .

Room-and the Tuck Shop, remod-
eled by Szabo during the summer,
were more favorable. One stu-
dent admitted that “it looks a lot
better than before.” But his friend
wondered how much it would cost
to incorporate air conditioning-
"It’s always the hottest place in
the school.”

Jim Bridgeman, a sophomore
English major, said that the Hunt
Room looks better since its re-
modeling, that “it looked like a
latrine before.” Commenting on
the new vending machines. he
mentioned that “if they keep on
working, they’re better thanthe
old ones. You can’t see the dust
in the corners,” which, he said,
was characteristic oflthe previous"
ones.

Douglas Brown, a first-year stu-
dent in" the Graduate School of
Business, likes the atmosphere in
the Hunt Room. He thinks that the
vending machines are a_ “worth-
while convenience.”

Richard Devlin, a freshman in

‘Arts and Sciences, remarked that

the vending machines are"“a n_ice
variety,” but add'ed.._as,.he strug-
gled with the coin release, “they

could work better. '.’

ple on this campus.”

PITTSBURGH (AP)—The 129-
day-old city newspaper strike
ended Sunday night when the
morning Post-Gazette returned to
the streets following resolution of

, a snarl of labor disputes.

The afternoon Press, only other
daily in the city. was to resume
publication this afternoon.

The two papers, with a com-
bined circulation of over 600.000
were originally knocked from pub-
lication by a May 14 printers
strike against the Press, which
prints the Post-Gazette under con-

‘tract.

The primers strike ended Aug.
29 with acceptance of a new con-
tract. However contracts still
had to be negotiated with. nine
other craft unions.

By last weekend, all the unions
had either accepted new contracts
or agreed to return to work dur-
ing contract negotiations.

The most recent union to settle
was Engraver’s Local 16—P.
whose contract provided a $57.95
wage-f'ringe increase over two
years. ' '

ate defeated Friday,a move to re-
ject a compromise draft exten-
sion and military pay raise bill al-
ready approved by the House. The
vote was 47 to 36.

The action, a key victory for
President Nixon, came on a mo-
tion by Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D.-Mont., to table the
long-stalled legislation. The Pres-
ident’s draft authority expired on
June 30.

Nixon, who made an llth-hour
concession on the bill’s pay raise
features to win over crucial-votes,
told a news conference" Wednes-
day that scuttling the draft would
jeopardize negotiations aimed at
a mutual East-West arms reduc-
tion. .

Despite. Friday’s vote, the
month-long Senate fight over the
draft bill will go on. Vietnam war
critics and foes of any draft law
have vowed to filibuster against
Senate approval of the measure.

Defeat of Mansfield’s tabling
amendment, however, appeared
to kill any chance that his end-the-
war amendment would .be includ-
ed in the ‘legislation to extend the
draft for two years.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep.
Shirley Chisholm. the only black
woman in Congress, says she will
announce formally her candidacy
for the presidency on New Year’s
Day, providing she has enough
campaign money.

“I’m doing it to shake the sys-
tem up,” the 47-year-old New

Yorker said in an interview Wed-

nesday.

._“This country is run by old. old
men from the South. and I want to
make the people at the national
convention know they will have to

‘deal with me.” «

Ms. Chisholm said she would
enter three of the Democratic pri-
maries — North Carolina, Flori-
da and Ca1ifornia—if she can
raise enough money to finance her
campaign.

WASHINGTON (AP) —— The an-
tiwar march on Washington,
America’s military incursion into
Cambodia, Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew’s criticism of the na-
tion’s news media and the fatal
shooting of four students on the
Kent State University campus led
to Walter J. Hickel’s break with
the Nixon administration, the for-
mer Secretary of Interior says.

  
    

 

In the book entitled Who Owns
America? published by Prentice-
Hall, Hickel says President Nixon

war march on Washington.

ATTICA, N. Y. (AP)-—A member '

of a congressional panel investi-
gating the riot at Attica state pris-
on says he thinks there was "in-
discriminate shooting” when au-
thorities stormed the maximum
security facility to quell the up-
rising.

Members of the House Select
Committee on Crime spent seven
hours at the prison Saturday and
afterward Rep. Charles Rangel. a
Democrat from Harlem in New
York City, said: “I believe there
was indiscriminate shooting . . .
that much of the gunfire was un-

necessary."

The prisoner rebellion and last

' Monday’s assault on the prison by

a heavily armed force of state
troopers and backup personnel
left 30 prisoners and 10 prison
employees dead.

Rep. Claude Pepper. D.-Fla..‘
chairman of the congressional
committee, said. “Had there been
enough money, much of this trag-
edy could have been prevented.”
He said that because of inadequate
financing “all of us are responsi-
ble for what happened here.”

Unman_, Wittering, & Zigo

  Class Struggle Ensues

by STEVE zvcn

Unman, Wittering and Zigo, di-
rected by John Mackenzie and
currently featured at the King’s
Court, is a British thriller that
deals with some of the same is-
sues raised by two other notable
English films of the past decade:
If by Lindsy Anderson and Lord of

_ the Flies by Peter Brook.

Among these issues are the bes-
tiality of youth, the ‘sadistic
strength of the closely knit peer
group (e.g. the class) and the re-
bellion againstauthority by sup-
posedly staid and proper English
school boys. '

‘Unman, Wittering and Zigo

Hemmings is a replacement for
another schoolmaster, John Pel-
ham, who has died under very my-
sterious circumstances. It devel-
ops that he was killed by his class,
lower 5B, when he threatened to
keep them in on a Saturday as a
punishment. When Hemmings
plans to do the same, the class
calmly but chillingly informs him
that they in turn, will do the same.

Thus the film develops into a
Hitchcockian type of thriller with
Hemmings (and later his wife) on
one side and the sophisticated Bri-
tish brats on the other. The futile
struggles of Hemmings to reveal
his astounding story to others
(the head schoolmaster, his best

is appropriate and the suspense,
which is suitably tense and taut
throughout. Ditto for the direction
by newcomer John Mackenzie.

Hemmings’ efforts to break the
class down and locate its leader
form the.foundation of the story-
line. Suffice it to say the plot is
one of the best suspense/horror
ones I’ve witnessed in years.

Also highly commended is the
acting of the members of lower
5B, Hemmings’ class. Almost ev-
ery member conveys calculating
innocence convincingly, and the
scenes of the students’ sadism are
starkly terrifying.

Jefferson’ Airplane’s ‘Bark, 
Gets You There On Time’,-

by RON LOZOWSKI

Fly the friendly skies of Jefferson Airplane with the -

band’s latest release,,Bark. Don’t be misled. Although the
disc is packaged in a brown paper bag, the contents are
nothing to be ashamed of. And there’s nothing here that’s
quite so overtly political as Blows Against the Empire or
Volunteers. '

But the music is in the fine tradition of the latter disc
—it’s basically straight rock, considerably closer to the
earth than the previous surrealistic

tinues to get you there on time.

The album takes off with the surging “When the Earth
Moves Again”; “if you care to see the future look into the

eyes of your dancing children.” It really moves, and ideal- '
ly sets up the listener for the delightful “Feel So Good”— ,

a catch number that will make you do just that.
“Crazy Miranda” features one of Grace's freaked-

out vocals, telling us of a girl who “lives on propaganda/ 
she believes everything she reads/it could be one side or ‘

the other.” This cut was penned by Grace, as was the
puzzling f‘Never Argue with a German If You’re Tired or
European Song” (no relation whatsoever to Led Zeppelin’s
“Immigrant Song”-).

But the Slick number packing the most impact is the
hard-hitting (of course) “Lawman”—informing us that
“smiling breaks all the rules.”

“Third Week in the Chelsea” makes use of a soft
acoustic guitar sound recalling Simon and Garfunkel,
while the pulsating “Rock and Roll Island” lifts you off
your feet and carries you there with some of the Air-
plane's “California rock and roll thunder.”

The disc makes a three-point landing as “War Mov-
vie” unfolds, demonstrating that the group can still “roll
roll roll roll the rock around/lift the rock off the ground.”
In fact, the only out really failing to get off the ground is
Joey Covington’s irritating “Thunk”—it goes into a tail-
spin and lands with a “clunk.” But Joey redeems himself
with his contribution to the lovely “Pretty as You Feel.”

-The remainder of the album indicates that when
those old buttons-and bumper stickers advertised what we
should have realized all along—“Jefferson Airplane Loves
You”—they were merely attesting to the truth. Exception-
al sound flights such as this one are nothing to be sorry
for.

And don’t forget, you get that nice bag to play with.
There aren’t any groceries inside, but rather food for
thought (“feed your head,” remember?). What else can I
say? “If music be the food of love, play on.”

Posvar vows to hold
tuition , costs down

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

This past Thursday I had a short interview with Chancellor
Posvar to discuss Pitt’s financing.

He began by explaining how the University was just finishing
-its $3-million in budget cuts. These cuts were required because the
legislature reduced the Pitt appropriation bill from Governor Shapp’s
, recommended level of $43.2 million to $40,556,000.

Two-thirds of the budget reductions will come out of non-aca-
demic spending, according to the Chancellor. Such things as physical
plant expansion of the book store and other areas will be deferred.

Overhead will be cut by reducing money spent on supplies
for all areas of the University. Also, the budgets for athletics. public
affairs, student affairs, and the Chancellor’s office will be reduced.

The other third of the budget pruning will come in curtailed
academic spending. The Chancellor explained that the Provost
worked closely with the deans to establish these extra budget reduc-
tions. However, he assured, “These academic cuts will not be
j crippling because they comprise less than two percent of opera-
“ tional costs.”

The Chancellor further stated, “We don‘t plan to stop here.
Instead, the University will improve its efficiency and make fur-
 ' ther reductions in the costs of administration.”

One example of this continuing policy was the re-establishm_ent
of the freeze on non-academic hiring.

a On the question of /new tuition increases, the Chancellor was
_ less sure of himself. First, he explained, “My authority to govern
 tuition has been circumscribed by the state. I have no power to com-
I mit the University to freeze the tuition. ut I will fight to freeze
J the tuition and even try to reduce it.”

_ He then digressed and discussed how the present tuition of
$970 a year for most full-time students is too high. preventingmany
students from attending college. ‘

V He stated, “The present level of tuition works real hardships
. on middle and lower-middle income families.”

He then discussed how the deferred tuition plan, or what some
call the Yale Plan, might offer a partial solution for the present
high tuition costs. The basic idea of this plan is for students to re-
 . ceive loans to help pay for their education. .

After a student graduates, he would pay back his loan based on
his ability to pay. But the Chancellor cautioned that even though
the plan is a good idea, it is highly experimental. He suggested it
be ‘tested first on a limited basis. The administration is currently
considering testing a limited tuition deferment plan on the Medical
School.

Chancellor Posvar ended by promising that the University
will do its part in holding the line against further tuition increas-
es. He asserted, “I won’t have to raise tuition again unless the
State Board ‘of Education orders us to do so. . . if necessary I will
cut the budget first to prevent another tuition increase.” ‘

All of these many words sound very convincing, but words
aren’t enough. There are still some disturbing doubts in my mind.

In the past, the Chancellor was very emphatic in his argu-
ments before the media and the legislature that Pitt could not af-
ford any more budget cuts. He would allude that University
operations would be severely crippled if more money was not
coming from the Commonwealth. i

During this summer, when he increased our tuition, he made
the same argument again. The University was supposedly in dire
. need of cash.

  
 
  
       
  
  
 
  
 

  

But what is so icomicly odd is that now Chancellor Posvar has-

“quietly and efficiently cut $3 million from the budget. claiming
some ‘of the cuts will be good for efficiency and others will not be
crippling. Maybe the problem is his memory is too short or mine

____is too long. '

_ I basically agree with his more recent point of view, but even
more so. The University of Pittsburgh up to. now has been misman-
aged. During this summer, budgets should have been cut first.
like they have been now. instead of increasing our tuitions.

This attitude should be, and according to the Chancellor, will

- be, the policy in the future. I believe it’s possible with good man-

agement to freeze the tuition at its present level this educational

year and the next. And in principle, the Chancellor appears to
agree. '

 , So hopefully he will remember his promises to hold the line
'_ ._ when,',he_V_asserted. “I will fight to freeze the tuition and even
if "' try to" reduce it.”

Chancellor Posvar's decision to relo-
cate the-Housing. Food Service. Admis-
sions. and Financial Aid offices. on an
experimental basis, is timely and sound.

The offices currently report to the
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.
Bernard Kobosky. who was named Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs in July.

Kobosky. who has worn "two hats"
for two months, has been beleaguered
and deserves relief. With a lighter Stu-
dent Affairs burden, he should be able
to devote more attention to Public Af-
fairs arid get acclimated to his new post.

The experimental relocation should
also aid the work of a special commit-
tee on the future of Student Affairs,
which is in the midst of its deliberations.
Actually, the “temporary” changes will
probably prove permanent.

of Operations.

Other questions are still unresolved.
It is unclear where the remaining Stu-
dent Affairs divisions will be assigned
and it is moot whether the Vice Chan-
cellorship of Student Affairs is superflu-
ous. -

Finally, the Chancellor and his ad-
visorv committee have yet to decide whe-
ther the Athletic Department will con-
tinue to report directly to the Chancellor.

Hopefully, the committee will consid-

er placing Athletics under the jurisdic- _

tion of the Vic_e Chancellor for Public
Affairs, since the athletic program is
often touted for its public relations
benefits.

Chancellor to be relieved of the respon-

due to the fact that most of
us-in college today are products
of the post-World War II baby
boom. When we were in grade
school, teachers were badly
needed to handle all of us,
yet these teachers were born
during the low birth rates of
the depression.

Teacher pay. and status in-
creased due to the need for
teachers, teaching became a
desirable profession. Our par-
ents, teachers, ‘guidance counsel-
ors kept telling us—“Go into
teaching, it pays well, and it’s
easy to find ajob."

What we all ignored was that
the pattern of population growth
had reversed. In Pennsylvania
alone, from 1967 to 1970, grade

to drop another 260,000. Secon-
dary school enrollment is still
growing, slowly, but should
drop by 1973, and should de-
crease 160,000 by 1979.

The situation seems ideal for
smaller teacher/student ratios’
but the school boards don’t see
it that way. Many school boards
are not filling positions vacated
by retiring teachers due to the
financial situation and the in-
creasing conservatism of the tax-
payer.

Some are even firing special
services people—the reading,
teachers, the supervisors, the

- guidance counselors.

jobs are getting harder and harder to find. The U.S. Office of
Education predicts that in 1975. 227.000 college graduates will be
competing .for 172,000 openings in secondary and elementary
schools.

Universities and colleges were suddenly overwhelmed by a
flood tide of PhD‘s at a time when they were slowing expansion.
Manyschools have cut the number of faculty. often due to the loss
of government grant funds.

Many PhD’s are teaching in secondary schools. but getting
positions in public schools are difficult. since it’s much cheaper
for the school board to hire a B.A. than a PhD.

Some fields of education are still very open. Special educa-
tion‘. work with the handicapped. the mentally retarded and the
mentally disturbed, still seeks qualified professionals.‘ Industrial
and Vocational education are often ignored and thus still offer
opportunity to those with the skills and the interest.

Tenure laws were first passed to protect teachers, yet they
have gone to the extreme of protecting the teacher at the expense
of the children. It no longer seems necessary to have strong tenure
laws when the techniques of organized _labor can be used to protect
teachers and yet allow schools to free themselves from poor teach-
ers.

One of the great ironies of the teacher oversupply is that
schools are harboring oppressive and mediocre teachers while ex-
cellent and enthusiastic young teachers are pumping gas and sell-
ing shoes. '

With the flood of new blood we have today in the teaching
profession. there is no place for mediocrity.

‘Getting a teaching job without certification is a pipe dream
and may some day come under ancient history—unless. of course.
you are that one in a thousand John Holt who is into alternative

schools.

My advice for many people in education is simply GET OUT!

Before youaget into education. find out what you're getting
into—do an independent study and tutor or play with some real kids.
You may find they’re not all Buffys and Jodys (which is really the
truth, anyways) and you may actually HATE working with kids.

If you really think you have the goods and the dedication,
you’re going to have to do your own job finding. Very few school
districts are coming to the Educational Placement Service. not when
they‘ have a couple hundred walk-in applicants for a handful of
positionsl -

_ You may do well to apply to schools as far from,Pittsburgh ,as
possible. Many school districts in the Pittsburgh area are already
loaded with Pitt graduates, and would rather have an Ohio State
or West Virginia graduate-—but then your chances of getting a
job elsewhere are also greater. ' '

Always remember. as I have been told so many times. “There’s
always room for a good teacher.”

Although Fibel felt he could have
crossed over to the right side of
the goal area in time to make the
save, Pincus felt differently.

“I was playing back because it
was open,” related Pincus. “I saw
it coming and I didn’t think that
he (Fibel) could have had it.”

Pitt coach Leo Bemis was very
pleased with the defense. “They
did a very nice job—all the backs
did well,” he said.

“They (Bucknell) can score—in
a scrimmage they beat St. Fran-
cis, 8-0—but our defense did a good
job of shutting them out.”

With 25 seconds left in the
game, lineman Joe Luxbacher
scored the second goal for Pitt.

Ever’ since Pete Gogolak kicked his way into the headlines

by successfully placekicking via the sideways soccer style, the
‘ kicking specialists for many pro and college teams have resort-
. ed to that manner instead of the old conventional method. Soccer

players, hailing from both the United States and Europe, grad-
-‘ ually began to fill the ranks of football placekickers.

_ Last fall, the Pitt Panthers almost became another grid
team that depended on a coverted soccer_ player for its field
goals and extra points. John White, who had led the soccer team
in scoring as a freshman, practiced with the gridders. Because
"of complications from competing in the two sports, White re-

mained with the booters.

. Yesterday afternoon, Soccer Coach Leo Bémis was glad he
didn’t lose the service of of White. With only minutes remaining
in a scoreless tie with Bucknell, White deftly controlled a pass
from wingman Bill Rex and lined it past the Bison’s goalie.

The kick, which proved to be the winning tally, compensated

for a missed shot by White early in the game. All alone in front‘
' of the Bucknell goal, John fanned with a

wide open shot.

After the victory, a ‘ jubilant ‘White 

» admitted that the artificial turf may
--have aided him for the goal. “I hit it
well but I thought the goalie was go-

‘ ing to save it. For once, the turf help-

E ed it roll faster.”

Although White played the hero’s

4- role in the contest, he would still rath-
er be kicking for the football team. He
never competed in any grid action. but

    

JOHN wants

I _ placekicking was always a dream to be fulfilled.

. “With practice I think I could be good enough. but I'm real-
._ _ly. glad I'm playing soccer now, though,” he stated.

, Despite the lack of scoring punch displayed by the booters, it

. was evident that the squad is highly motivated and well prepared

for the season. The offense moved the ball around accurately and
the defense kept the Bisons bottled up in their own territory.

, White cited the team’s togetherness as a definite strength,
- although he felt the passing could have been crisper.

“Joe (Luxbacher) made several beautiful passes to me but
they took offbecause of the turf. We passed better in practice on

' the grass fields.”

. Throughout most of the contest, the offense was continually
C V ‘looking to the right wing, Chudho Valencia, for his attack. Part

, :_of the reason was the fact that the left wing, Bill Rex, is a '

"rookie andthe team has more confidence in the veteran Chucho.
-. Ironically, the important pass to White was sent by Rex after the
Bison defense had overplayed the right side of the field.

Modestly, White, a natural left footed ‘kicker, stated that

  

her doesnft have  right foot Aft_ei;}_, taking the pass ‘from, v

passed the ball from mid field all
the way down to lineman Chucho
Valencia who then passed it over
to Luxbacher.

The Bison.goalie, David Millar,
came out to the 18 yard line to get
the ball but Luxbacher beat him to
it and lofted the ball over Millar’s
head, bouncing it into the goal.

‘Bemis was not too concerned
about the lack of scoring in the
first three periods of the game,

“It was our first game and you
expect these things to happen to
good players.” he stated.

“They (the Bisons) had two
scrimmages and we didn’t have
any,” continued Bemis. “If we
had, we would have settled down
and scored early." The ‘statistics
proved we have a good team and I
know we’.ll score goals when we
meet good teams.”

Bucknell had its own reasons
why Pitt didn’t score and when
they themselves were not able to
score any points.”

“Pitt didn’t score because the
Bucknell defense was good and
Pitt couldn’t finish off their
plays,” stated Joe Steinmetz, cap-.
tain of Bucknell’s offensive team.
“We didn’t score, not because
we’re not used to-playing on astro
turf but because we’re (the of-
fense) no good.”

Bemis was also pleased with
the attendance — approximately
200 fans_—-and he was especially
grateful to the Pitt band who
agreed to perform at the game in
the Stadium.

“It made a world of difference,”
said Bemis.

.Defe nde rs

For the entire 1970 season, the stats on.Doug
Gindin read, “four receptions for 45 yards and no
touchdowns. ” '

After the 1971 season’s opener. against the UCLA
Bruins, Gindin had accumulated 75 yards on six re-
ceptions, including a 21 yard touchdown grab. Some
where along the line Gindin had arrived. I

“I must have started five games at flanker last
year,”.commented the lanky senior from Downing-
ton, Pa. “They just never threw to me.” “

Stacked behind Steve Moyer, Joel Klimek and Bill
Pilconis last year it’s no wonder that the pigskin did-
n’t fly in Gindin’s direction. But when you stand six
feet fives inches tall and weigh 206 pounds people
are bound to notice you. Like John Hogan, for in-
stance, who isolated Gindin on Bruin defender Ron
Carver who only stands at 5-9. The result was a 21
yard touchdown pass.

“I saw the ball coming,” said Gindin, “I usually
wait for it to get to me but this time I sorta jumped
into it and then fell backward into the end zone. I
didn’t even know the defender was behind me.”

Carver knew, as Gindin came plummetting down
on top of him. Laterin the game Dave Havern began
to isolate Gindin again with the same results.

“I saw they were in a zone,” Havern commented
after the game, “so I just tried to force the free
safety into a one-on-one situation.’-’

A veteran of two grueling but rewarding cam-
paigns, Gindin became a Panther the same year Carl
DePasqua took over the reigns as head coach. The
fact that everyone on this year’s squad failed to ex-
perience the one and nine seasons of the Dave Hart
‘era goes a long way toward explaining why the Pan-
thers havega winning attitude.

“There’s no quitters, no bitchin’ this year," said
Gindin. “At practice people are out there on the field
at 4 o’clock warming up. We don’t start until 4:30.
That never happened before/’

“The. guys are more enthusiastic after the win,”
Gindin offered. “That was great too.” '

But with it all the Panthers are a young team
and the veterans like Gindin know it. Sophomores
make mistakes, but sodo seniors.

“All these sophomores, by the fifth, sixth game,”
commented the big split end, “are going to get bet-
ter and better. They're going to learn more and
more each game. Heck, I’m still learning.

“We’re a young team,” he continued, “but we
had some real good performances against UCLA.
Hyde and Buckmon are both going to be tough.when
they’re seniors and Englert was great ‘last week. ”

Looking ahead to the rest of the season is a tough

proposition. There are a lot of questionmarks that

 Mechtmical Difficulties

 Brake Camaro Again

by STEVEN WILLIAMS

The University of Pittsburgh Road Racing Team's Camaro ran into
mechanical difficulties for the sixth race in a row this weekend at War-
ren. Ohio. forcing them to drop out of the race.

"The new engine was working satisfactorily. the brakes were work-
ing properly and everything seemed all right." explained Bob Fryer.
"We were running first in our class midway through the national fea-
ture when the front sway bar link broke. The car was completely crip-

pled and had to leavethe race.“

The race had the most outstand-
ing field of competitors the Pitt
team has faced. Warren Toupe and
Marshall Robbins were driving
professional ‘Trans-Am Chevrolet
backed Camaros. And Warren
Agar was also there.

The Pitt team performed in a
winning fashion until the untime-
ly mechanical failure. They quali-
fied third in the field of 26.
They were running first in their
class when they dropped out at
midpoint of the race.

Fortunately. there was no
change in the point standings in
the Northeastern division. The
Pitt team is still in fifth position.
four points out of third place.
They are still within reach of the
invitation to AtlantaonThanksg1v-
ing weekend. '

Even with this stroke of mis-
fortune siniting the team in every
race. the "spirit of the team is

still high." according to ‘Susan
Powell. publicity director. "Ev-.

seemed to have a great time. For
some it was the first time to the
track. They felt the same as the
older members. felt. optimistic at
the start of the race and deject-
ed when we had to withdraw."

With only three races left to
move up in the standings, Fryer is
still hopeful. “It would be easy
to be dejected. Accidents like ours
don’t happen. The failure is due to
a job we do ourselves. We have to
find the problem and correct.
Hopefully, the engineers from
school can do it.”

Hopefully, the Pitt team won’t
run into any more difficulties this
weekend in another race at War-
ren. Ohio.

SC Promises Money 

When the Pitt rifle squad disbanded early this month. it marked

the first minor sport to feel the effects of budget cuts by the adminis- '

tration. The Athletic Department. trimming their allocations for the
year cut off all funding of the team.

But now there appears to be a ray of hope in the squads efforts to
stay alive. According to veteran ri-fleman and captain of the now dis-
banded team Bruce Barrett. "Denny Concilla will try to get money for
the squad."

Concilla. a member of student
Government. has promised to go
to the Allocations Committee and
plead the team’s case.

“He said he can guarantee us
$2,500,” Barrett announced.
