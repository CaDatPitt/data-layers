DriVeOpens
Next Month

A $4000 goal, the highest
ever to be set by Pitt Chest,
is the aim of Pitt Chest Week

which will take place Nov. 11.

to Nov, 15.

Eugene Klein, Bus: Ad. ’59,

chairman of the Pitt Chest com-
mittee, announced that last year's
goal of $3500 has been raised by
the Advisory Council. Members
are Mrs. Virginia Milligan, as-
sistant to the Dean of Women;
Jack Hardman, assistant to the
Dean of Men; Miss Olga’Krill,
executive secretary of YWCA; and
representatives of the Pitt Chest
committee and student govern-
ment bodies.

’ Plan to Educate

Klein stated that this was made
possible only by the plan to edu-
cate the student body of the func-
tions and goals of the Pitt Chest
before the campaign rather than
during the soliciting as had been
done previously.

An intensiﬁed educational pro-
gram will be getting under way
within the next few weeks so
everyone will be well acquainted
with the Pitt Chest. t

According to the present plan,
Klein states that Pitt students
will receive a total of 30 per-
cent. Men's Loan Fund will re-
ceive 20 percent and Women’s

Loan Fund 10 percent.

Thirty-seven percent is reserv-
ed for other students with 30 per-
cent planned for the World Uni-

versity Service and seven percent

for the National Scholarship Serv-
ice and Fund for Negro Students.
The remaining 33 percent -will go
toward the Community Fund.
United Fund will receive 30 per-
cent and CARE three percent.
Funds Collected

Therefore, Pitt and other stu- A

dentswill receive 67 percent and
the community 33 percent of the
funds collected. This will be sub-
Ject to change because of a new
plan set up for this year’s cam-
paign.

During Pitt Chest week one
hour will be set aside for solicit-

ing in class rooms. Envelopes will.

be passed out at this time which
will have printed on them, “I will
give.” “I am pledging,” or “I do
not wish to give.”

Everyone is urged to check
one of these and sign their name
to the envelope whether they
contribute to the fund or not.
This is being asked to prevent
further complications and con-
fusion. Those who do not turn in
envelopes within a few days
after they are distributed will
be contacted.

Therefore anyone not wishing to
donate should sign the envelope
and turn it in and they will not
be contacted again.

Pledges Fulﬁlled

Pledges should be fulﬁlled as
soon as possible after the day of
soliciting. The envelopes can be
turned in at the Student Desk on
the ground floor of the Cathedral.

A follow-up campaign, under
the direction of the Finance Com-
mittee, will contact those who
have not been contacted and those
who made pledges and did not
fulﬁll them.

The new feature this year is 

that the allocations can be
changed if the Pitt students de-

Service Efficiency

  

  
 

Although the University Police
Force was first organized in 1956,
the department worked relatively
unnoticed until it acquired a fleet
of motor scooters.

This summer, the University
bought three vehicles for the use
of the Police Department a three-
wheeled scooter, equipped with a
siren, red—light and “POLICE”
sign; a regular motorcycle; and a
two-wheeled scooter.

Despite comic remarks about
the mobilized Police Force, the
newly-purchased vehicles have
increased the efficiency rate of
the whole department. Lt. Char-
les Ray, head of the police de-
partment, commented: “It gives
us ,a much more frequent cov-
erage than would be possible
on foot.”

In addition to working with the
city and county police, the regular
duties of the officers encompass
all phases of law enforcement on

Dr.Tillich To Speak
On Ways Of Knowing

Dr. Paul Tillich, noted thinker, author and lecturer, will
speak to Pitt students on Sunday afternoon, from three to
ﬁve o’clock, in the Clapp Hall Auditorium. Students will also
have an opportunity to question Dr. Tillich, a refugee from

, Nazi tyranny in Germany and now “University Professor” at

I 0 Harvard.-

Dr. Tillich’s topic
“Ways of Knowing.”

The Pitt Student Council of
Religious Organizations is spon-
soring the Sunday student semi-
nar with Dr. Tillich. The Council
,\has also arranged for free park-
ing in the University parking lot
adjacent to Clapp Hall for stu-
dents attending the event.

Dr. Tillich, whose classes in
philosophy and religion are the
largest at Harvard, was born in

V Prussia in 1886, the son of a
Protestant minister.

He studied at several European
. universities and has received
‘numerous honorary degrees from
colleges and universities through-
out the world.

Before coming to the United
States, Professor Tillich held
teaching positions in several Ger-
man uinversities including the
University of Berlin. He served
as a war chaplain in the German
._5_army during the first World War
before beginning his teaching
career. I

Dr. Tillich came to America
in 1933, when as an outspoken
critic of Nazism, he was forced
to leave Germany after the rise

’ of Hitler. He became a citizen
of the United States in 1940.

_ For 25 years, Dr. Tillich taught
at Union Theological Seminary in
New York City. After retiring
from Union, he accepted. an invi-
tation to join the faculty of Har-
vard Divinity School.

In July of 1954, Dr. Tillich was
appointed, "University Professor”
in Harvard University. The title

--of "University Professor” at Har-
vard is reserved for a small num-
ber of scholars who are free to

, work on the “frontiers of know-
ledge” without restriction.

Dr. Tillich is a member of the
American Theological Associa-
tion, The American Philosophic-

al Association, and the Amer-
ican Academy of Arts and

Sciences.

from the ancient Greeks in the
use of an arena-like stage.

The audience completely sur-
rounds the actors, and no one is
more than a few feet from the
action on the stage. Every seat is
a good seat. He added that this
surrounding of the actors by the
audience gives rise to a few minor

complications.
For example, it is now neces-
sary for Miss Granowitz to

change costume while still on
the stage. However, Mcﬂale and
Lloyd Welden, technical direc-
tor, are confident that a solu-
tion will be arrived at before
‘/ ‘.onight’s performance.

Tickets are now available at
the Student Desk, and they will
be sold from 7 p.m. to show time
on the night of each performance.
The show will run four consecu-
tive nights, Wednesday through

‘tutoring services

Since the end of World War
II, Professor Tillich has returned
to his native Germany to teach in
some of the leading universities
during the summer.

Dr. Tillich’s main interests
from his early German writings”
up to the present have always
been the boundary line between
theology and philosophy, and
generally between religion and
culture. l

In addition to his lecturing, Dr.
Tillich is now completing the
second volume of his life work,
“Systematic Theology.” Professor
Tillich builds his theology on “the
matter of correlation between
questions arising out of “the hu-
man predicament and the answers
given in the classical symbols of
religion.”

He is also the author of other
philosophical books which have
been translated into several for-
eign languages.

the envelope speciﬁcally where
they want their money to go. If
there are enough pledges in one
area or the other, the percentage
will be changed accordingly to
satisfy the students.

Klein says that the Pitt Chest
feels it should represent the in-
terest of the Pitt student body in
regard to the allocations of its
fund.

The Ugly Man Contest spon-
sored by Alpha Phi Omega and
several other special events will
take place during Pitt Chest
Week. A banquet will mark the

Tutoring Services
Are Available For

Freshman Classes

Phi Eta Sigma, freshman hon-
orary fraternity, is offering free
to all under-
graduates taking f r e s h m a n
courses. The program began Mon-
day, Oct. 20.

Coures offered include: Chem-
istry 1, English 1, Biology 1, Math
21, Math 19, and Physics 5.

The classes are offered at
various times in specially de-
signated rooms in the Cath-
edral, so that students needing
assistance may have opportunity
to use the tutoring service in
their freelhours.

Students whd wish to enroll for
the service should contact Miss

Interfraternity C o u n c i 1
passed a resolution last week
declaring a three week open
bidding period for new stu-
dents.

The period begins Friday,
Oct. 25 and ends Nov. 15. This
will make it possiblefor any stu-
dent who was not pledged during
the formal bidding period to be
rushed and extended a bid to
pledge. The time limit does not
apply to upperclassmen who may
accept bids at any time during
the semester.

Wednesday, October 23, 1957_'rrn: rrrr NEws_.rag‘e 3

The old rule applying to
freshmen is stated in the Men’s
Fraternity Rush and Initiation
Rules as follows: “If a. new stu-
dent does not accept a fraternity
bid within the bidding period,
he cannot do so until the fol-
lowing semester.”

According to Ray King, advisor
to IFC, the men passed this re-
solution to enable those students,
who for one reason or another
could not participate in the formal
bidding period, to be bid inform-
ally.

He also pointed out that this
is the practice on the majority

IFC Declares Open Bidding Period

of campuses which have frater-
nities. V

The same system of the frater-
nity’s submitting a bid card to
the Office of the Dean of Men
and having the man pick it up
there will be in effect. King add-
ed that all other rushing and
initiation rules will also be ob-
served.

Any student who wishes to be
rushed during this period should
leave his name at the student
desk, ground floor, or the DOM’s
Office, eighth floor. A list will
then be compiled and circulated
among all of Pitt’s fraternities.

 Sensible Drinking laws

Interfraternity Council, after the suggestion of Mr. Ray King,
is now conducting a full-scale investigation of the advantages of a
wet campus at Pitt. - ‘

King is serving as advisor to the committee, which is headed
by the invincible‘Eddy Ifft. King has had experience at both wet
and dry schools and is aware of the problem as a national one.
Ifft has stated in private interview that he will not stop until action
is taken by -the school.

Since the investigation was launched in answer to a PITT NEWS
challenge, it is proper that the newspaper should make their stand
clear and outline the possible attainments of such a committee.

' ‘First of all it should be understood that there is a state law
in Pennsylvania which prohibits sale or provision of alcoholic bev-

‘erages to those under 21 years of age. This law must be respected

and enforced by the University and all organizationsmand individuals
of the school. It should make every effort to comply with the
wishes of Gov. George M. Leader in his recent letter to Chancellor
Litchﬁeld quoted below:

Dear Dr. Litchﬁeld:

Under date of July 27, 1957, I wrote to you quoting the Penn-
sylvania Liquor Code, and requesting your co—operation in stamp-
ing out the serving of alcoholic beverages to minors on the schoo
campus and its neighborhood. ‘

A little over a year has passed and it is my feeling that your
efforts have been for the most part successful. However, as a new
term begins I would appreciate your assistance again in making
the law known to your students.

I am quite sure that your faculty and the parents of these young
people to whom we are ultimately responsible will co-operate in
our joint efforts. ‘ . *

With kindest regards, I am , e *
- Sincerely yours,
:- George M. Leade$r

Since the University receives an annual allotment from the
state there is no doubt that every attempt will be made to carry
out_this request to the fullest extent.

But the University has a law too. One which is neither re-
spected nor enforced. It reads, “There shall be no sale or use of
beer, wine or liquor of any kind at meetings or social functions
held under the auspices of University activitiesand organizations
whether upon University property or elsewhere.”

This law only applies, apparently, for undergraduate ‘fraternity
affairs. But the statement is for ALL University organizations.
This includes the professional schools and their organizations which
almost make public statements concerning cocktail parties and‘ other
alcoholic endeavors. It also includes ALL spectators at our stadium
and ﬁeld house, whether they belong to the puritanic Pitt family
or not.

So what must be done is obvious: either the University ap-
plies and enforces the law for EVERYONE or it will be forced by
student opinion to repeal the inspired ruling now on the books.

 If the University chooses to ignore this recent ‘move by stu-
dents itis showing itself to be neither progressive nor aware of the
greatest social problem facing,America’s colleges today.

j, -This is a national problem. Pitt can take the first step toward
eistablishing sane and sensible laws for campus drinking and thereby.
set‘ a national precedent. The present laws are totally inadequate.
To enforce them as they now stand would mean the ﬁning of every
group on campus withonly the possible exception of religious or-
ganizations. It would mean a foolishly long series of violators from

. the leaders of the school to the ever persecuted undergraduate.

 It is time th-ere were laws which could reasonably be enforced.
lg’; is time there were laws of some decent equality. These are the
aims which the committee hopes to attain by the constant pressure
of public opinion. =  '5

‘Big Red Out Of Action  . .

City's Sore Spot  

By Gordon Clowney

While it certainly is not surprising, or unlooked
for, the inconvenience caused by the trolley strike

which began 10 days ago is, and

for the majority of Pittsburghers on this score, un-

appreciated.

If negotiations, or lack of same, to date, are in-
strike will con-

dicative of how long the present
tinue, then we could be in for
a mighty long wait before mat-
ters a_re ironed out and the two
opposing sides can arrive at a
mutually acceptable course of
action.

While “Big Red”, more com-
monly known as the Pittsburgh
streetcar, rests idly at its home
in the car barn, thousands of
Pittsburghers are rearranging
their commuting schedules to
conform to the loss of the city’s

main’ means of mass transportation.

Some are walking, some hitching, others are
taking advantage‘ of car pools. But the effects of
the strike are felt by nearly everyone, even those

who drive their own cars.

Many motorists are going out of their way to
pick up riders, those who work or go to school
with them, or just fellow travelers going in their
direction. Traffic jams and tieups exist at every
major thoroughfare, and many minor ones during
the morning and afternoon rush hours.

Everyone Loses

However, trafﬁc, bad as it may be, is only one
of the consequences of a mass transit strike. Sta-
tistics compiled at the end of the ﬁrst week of
the strike revealed that the sales of downtown re-
tail stores _were off $1,700,000. The big department
stores were responsible for $1,350,000 of this

amount.

' The Pittsburgh Railways Company lost an es-
-timated $383,000 in revenue and the striking op-
erators and caintenance men lost $187,545 in wages

but stop and think what they will look like if the
strike continues for any length of time.

Last exposed to a strike of this nature in the
Spring of 1954,

the Pittsburgh area was without

lost money at the rate of $81,000 a week in wages-

The money the company, the strikers, and re-
tail stores lost, combined with the lost wages of

people who couldn’t get to work totaled more than

30 million dollars for the ﬁve week strike.

For a city whose huge, and certainly admirable
renaissance program is now in full swing, this trol- ‘
ley strike stands out as a sore thumb. There are
many cities whose civic development has not kept‘
pace with ours over the past decade, but ‘few 
any who have been forced to suffer two trolley .
strikes within a period of less than four years.

Better Than Nothing

In a way, it’s nice to know we live in a city
that is_ resourceful enough to carry on and make
the best of things in spite of a strike of this na-
ture. But somehow it would be so much nicer to
know that the streetcars were running. '

It’s during times like this that we realize, de-‘ 0‘

etips theipoor service and high rates, “Big Red” is

better then nothing at all.

Whether the situation calls for compulsory at-
bitration, the establishment of a transit authority,‘ ,
public ownership, public subsidies, a municipal . .
owned and leased to the company arrangement,
or some other plan, something has to be done that

isn’t being done now.

New American Poets

«By Fifzhugh Schenleyi

If Peter Beagle and Jay Butler
and other student poets at Pitt

need a publisher for their poems,
they should become acquainted
with Rolfe Humphries, who has
just edited his second volume of
NEW ‘POEMS BY AMERICAN
POETS, published in paperback
by Ballantine.

Mr. Humphries has been guided
by his belief that there are in
this country good poets who are
writing well and need to be pub-
lished. He has chosen the work of
some well-known poets, such as
Auden, Marianne Moore, Richard
Wilbur,‘ Louise Bogan, and Mark
Van Doren, but most of the poems
have been written by poets who
still have not published a large

This anthology is as modern in
spirit as the morning newspaper.
It is not easy to read, nor is it
difficult. Any collection of poems
makes‘ demands on the reader if
the poems have any worth. If the

reader savors the full meaning of

each poem, he will have a rugged
experience with this book.

The new poets here published
speak clearly and directly to the
reader. A virtue of the book is its
freshness. It is a pleasure to come
upon lines like those of Philip

Booth:

It softens now, April snow

sinks metling in the lawn, the
swamp

is blurred with promises, the
.willow '

hazed faint green. A month ago

the view was longer. Through l

the fence,
by a last birch hung with ice-
glazed
bittersweet, two cock pheasants
fed and fisked their tridescence.‘

Nothing is forced in these lines,
and certainly no reader, taking

the whole poem, would ﬁnd any

obscurity in meaning.

Some of the poets force their
imagery to quite impossible
lengths. Samuel Albert dallies
with all kinds of connotations in
his “Street-Walker in Maiich.”
This is a night to be out
Whoring with the winds.
Tipping with her spring
draughts

Beguiling to her secret bower,
Your head upon her breast.

Her moistened lips seeking
Your mouth; slapping your face
With the back of her hand.

Her strident limbs buckling

Around your waist, combing

Your hair with caressing
ﬁngers.

This is a night to be out
Whoring with the wind.

The poem is not unsuccessful,
only somewhat strained.

No anthologist seems able to re-
sist the work of e. e. cummings
and Mr. Humphries is no excep-
tion. The first four lines of one
cummings’ poem, not incompre-
hensible in its entirety,’ indicate

_what the reader may expect.

united by prefect nothing:

John Holmes,'the Tufts College
professor and critic who is cur-
rently visiting the Pitt campus, is
represented by three poems, each
equally effective in its comments
on a small incident in the poet’s
experience. “The Fortune Teller,”
too long for quotation here is the
best of the three, in the opinion
of this reviewer.

The poems of some established
poets are not always good. The
great Langstcn Hughes probably
should not have contributed his
light verse, “Gone Boy”:

u -g,.

Let’s hope a permanent settlement to the trans-
portation problem in this city is affected as quickly
as possible. But until such time comes, as a “cat”

He ain’t gone.

It is clever, but not too satisfying ‘

as a poem.

The editor says in his foreword
that the poets published in this

' book have not submitted riiany of

the “I—feel—terrible” kinds of
poems. He is correct, but probably
his Poets have become too sophis-
ticated to be obviously morbid.

Audrey McGaﬂ’1n, has published a ‘

set of three “A Poor Relation” is

The other two are entitled, “The

contents herself with wry com-
ments on life.

BUSY——Lynda Couch, a Student Union Staff member, is busily
working at her desk. In addition to working all over the country,
Lynda attended undergraduate school at the University of Illinois
and completed her graduate work at Cornell.

r Academic Taste Attracts

Lynda To Student Union

By TERESA SIRIANNI
“A Student Union has a vital role to play in the Univer-
sity community,” commented Lynda Couch, a Student Union

Staff member.

“It can administer a program along broad cultural, edu-

cational, social and recreational lines to implement and to '

supplement the academic learning of the classrooms.”

Her duties entail “a little bit of
everything.” She concerns herself
with arrangements, publicity, pro-
gram and procedure planning.

Her academic and student in-
terest brought her to a university.
The Renaissance in Pittsburgh
and at Pitt attracted Miss Couch
to come here.

She is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Illinois where she
majored in sociology. Mortar
Board, and work with the “Y”
were among her activities at the
University of Illinois. As a
member of the “Y,” she was
State Chairman which made it
her job to co-ordinate regional
Y’s all over Illinois.

She also worked with Interna-
tional Students as the Director of
Freshman Camp for Women. As a
senior, Miss Couch was Chairman
of the Freshman Executive Board

which orientated freshman women A

at the University of Illinois.
She did graduate work at Cor-
nell. As a liberal arts graduate,
she participated in the Ford Foun-
dation Experimental Program in
elementary education. She was
tapped into Pi Lambda Theta, a
national honor association for
women in education, while there.
Miss Couch also did some ele-
mentary teaching in Connecticut.
Some of her main interests are

in the social sciences, students and
their activities, and religion. She
also enjoys arts and crafts and
camping. Miss Couch spent two
summers in New Mexico where
she helped set up a primitive
camping program through the
Girl Scouts in Sante Fe National
Forests. She made many sketches
while in New Mexico, but gave
most of them away.

Miss Couch attended a

YMYWCA Leader School for
six weeks in Berkley, Calif.,
one summer. There she gained
experience in community rela-
tions. She worked with Ameri-
can Friends in studying slum
areas in Richmond, Calif., which
were formerly Nisei areas. She
also received theology training
there. Speakers there included
Jack Finnegan, author of
YOUTH ASKS ABOUT RELI-
GION, and other theologians.

Miss Couch also enjoys cooking
very much. She has a U.N. Cook-
book and practices cooking for-
eign dishes. This should come in
very. handy since she plans to be
married soon.

She and her ﬁance plan to live
in‘Pittsburgh. When asked about
her work here, Lynda Couch re-
plied, “It’s quite exciting and I’m
enjoying it very much.”

Gridders Travel Wlest;
Meet Undefeated Irish

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The chastened Panthers will ‘pad softly into the mean
football territory of the Midwest this Saturday _in an attempt
to untie the knot that the Army Cadets put in his tail._

' The Irishmen of Notre Dame will host the Blue and Gold
on their home sod of South Bend, Indiana. The game has
been a sellout for a couple of weeks and a crowd in excess

of 57,000 will be in attendance.

The football sages, who took
a rather nasty licking from the
ﬁgures on their form charts last
weekend will probably favor the
home team. This decision comes
as a result of Notre Dame’s per-
fect three game record and a win
over Army, two weeks ago,

much what the pre-season poll-

are out to improve it. '

Last year the Panthers coyly
invited an inexperienced squad
of Irishmen to the Stadium. No-
tre Dame coach Terry Brennan
was in his‘ ﬁrst year as head
man. The locals clobbered both
the Green and Gold and their

fresman tutor, by a .36-13 count. '

The score would have been
higher in the Jungle‘Cats’ favor
had it not been for the efforts of
the stellar Paul Hornung.

were idle last Saturday while The
Panthers were taking a physical
pounding from Army.

“With this added time for rest
and practice, they may even
move out of the T and throw
the single wing at us,” noted
Coach Michelosen. “They have
a ﬁne set of running backs and
Bob Williams has come‘ along
well as their quarterback.”

While on the subject of physic-
al condition it might be added
that the locals are in pretty fair
shape. Only ﬁeld general Bill
Kaliden seemed to be worse for
wear after last Saturday’s game.
His thigh may be bruised but it
shouldn’t keep him out of action.
Halfback Andy Sepsi will be back

his strained knee.

Passing Attack Increases

The flu bug should have parted
company with fullback Fred Rid-
dle, leaving the husky linebucker

Guard Dick Carr will have left
the sick bay by. Saturday also.
Whether he will play is doubtful.

The Army loss was not with-
out its bright spots for Pan-
ther rooters. Initially, it showed
the increase in the Blue and
Gold passing attack. Twenty
aerials were tossed by the local
back. Eight found the mark for
153 yards and the two‘Panther
touchdowns.

Relief quarterback Ivan Toncic
was responsible for the majority
of the passes and heaved the two
scorers. His generalship was good
on the whole. His outstanding
move was the touchdown play to
Dick Scherer in the second‘. quar-
ter. With third down and three
yards to go from the Army 37
yard line, he elected to go for the
big yardage and caught the
Cadets with their chins partially

Fencing Technique
Changed, In Club

Practice Sessions

Miss Ellen Gerber, advisor of
the Pitt Fencing Club, has an-
nounced a change in club policy
as to teaching procedure.

This year, Dr. William Mc-
Knight, coach and instructor for
the club, plans to stress the tech-
nique of saber fencing for the
men’s team.

Although the foil, epee and
saber require approximately the

same skill and quality of form, .

saber fencing is considered to
be the most rugged and power-

ful of the three styles of fenc-.
ing.

The women’s team will con-
tinue to use the foil, as the epee
and saber are primarily men’s
weapons.

In addition to the annual meets
with the local college teams, Miss
Gerber plans to initiate a series
of matches among the women
fencers at the university.

The main purpose of these
meets will be to give the wom-
en’s team additional experience
in competitive fencing and to
introduce the women’s fencing
class to the formal match pro-
cedure. .

The fencing club meets every
Tuesday, from 6 to 8 p.m. in the
Cathedral Gym. Everyone is in-
vited tovattend the practice ses-
sions and observe the veteran
fencers in action.

Details of the scheduled
matches will appear at a later
date.

Scherer played his usual rock-

voted the outstanding lineman
of the game by sports writers.:
The first string line had to put
in yeoman-like service as not
one lineman was relieved until

end to end, Scherer, Ron Kissel,
John Guzik, Charley Br‘ueck-

Panther Bootersscheduled Tilt
Cancelled Due To Flu Epidemic

By JIM LACEY

For the ﬁrst time in Panther history a soccer game had
to be cancelled because of the ﬂu. The game in question was
the Slippery Rock game ‘which was to have been played last
Saturday. It will be re—played on Tuesday, Nov. 12. ‘

Immediately Coach Leo Bemis began to looktoward next
Saturday’s game with the Ohio State Buckeyes. The Blue and

Gold have played Columbusmen
three times kmerging on top with
a 2-1 record. ‘

Last year the Buckeyes had
one of the best freshman» teams
in the “Big Ten.” Ohio State has
designs of becoming one of the
top teams in the Big Ten when
soccer is made a varsity sport.

The Yearlings are catching the
eye of Bemis even though they
lost the opening game to Shady-
side Academy by a 2-1 count.

Last week, the Freshman°beat
the Slippery Rock Freshman 2-1.
Dick Hopkins and ‘Fernando Fa-
bragas scored the goals.

Several of the other boys have
caught Coach Bemis’s eye with
their ﬁne play. Fabragas, an ex-
change student from Columbia,

is one of the standouts.

Steve Nagle and Ron Prado,
a pair of halfbaoks, have sparkled
in early games. Paul Knouse also
showed a lot of improvement be-
fore his ear became infected and
forced him to quit for this year.

The Yearlings have a return
engagement with’ the Slippery
Rock Rockets on Oct. 25. They
also meet Shadyside Academy on
Oct. 29 and they travel to Kiski
Prep for the ﬁnal game on Nov.
20.

Coach Bemis will have his
charges, both varsity and fresh-
man, practicing and scrimmaging
at Kinnard Field preparing for
their up-coming battles.

Brennan 1 Puts “Fight”
Into The “Fighting Irish”

By MURRAY CHASS
After leading a Notre Dame football team to its worst
record in the 68 years the South Bend, Ind., team has played

the game, youthful Terry Brennan was faced this season
with the prospect of win or take his grid knowledge else-

where.

Now with three games in the record book, Brennan has

shown that he can do it. He has¢

put the “Fight”
“Fighting Irish.”
Notre Dame shut out its ﬁrst
two opponents, both members of
the Big Ten. The Irish downed
Purdue, 12-0, and more than
doubled. that total against In-
diana, 26-0. Purdue, by the way,
is the team that upset top-ranked
Michigan State last Saturday.

Irish Have Rest

Before their open date last
weekend, the Irish added a third
victory to their 1957 mark, this
one coming over the Army Cadets,
23-21. For all who don’t recall
the thrilling climax of this game,
the winning points were tallied
by sophomore Monty Stickies on
a ﬁeld goal.

It was in this last contest that
Notre Dame proved they once
again deserve the “Fighting”
name. And after a Saturday of
rest, Brennan’s South Benders
should be all the more ﬁghting.
A comparison of scores with a
common foe, Army, should be
enough to foretell this Satur-
day’s outcome at Norte Dame
Stadium.

The score of the Irish-Cadet
tussle is above and no mention
need be made of the Panthers’
game with the latter. From this
comparison one must conclude
that the Irish will win their
fourth of the year.

the crowd who refuse to abide
by those silly old comparisons. So

for these fans, we will take a
glance at the make up of the 29-
year old Brennan’s fourth Notre
Dame squad.

Junior Bob Williams has the
job that was owned and oper-
ated by the untouchable Paul
Hornung last year, that of quar-
terbacking the team. Although
Williams doesn’t promise to give
the Panthers ﬁts the way

BOB WILLIAMS
Notre Dame Quarterback

Hornung did in 1956, he never-
theless will display ﬁne signal-
calling form.

He will be joined in the back-
ﬁeld by a-coup-le of other juniors
and a senior. One of the juniors,
Nick Pietrosante, has been the
rambler -on the ground for the
Irish from his fullback spot. His
rushing average thus far is a neat
6.0 yards per try. Behind him is
Dick» Lynch, the senior halfback. ’

Lewis May Play

Lynch has an average of 4.1
yards a carry and leads the team
in scoring with three touchdowns.

Frank Reynolds completes the
backﬁeld at a halfback position.
There is the possibility that
Aubrey Lewis, ﬂeet-footed half-
back, will be ready for action
against the Panthers. Lewis
missed the Irish’s last two
games because of an ankle in-
jury, ‘but reports -from South
Bend say that he is now intact.

Among the standouts in the line
are End Dick Prendergast, Guard

Jim Schaaf -— who leads the Irish ..

defense in tackles made —- Bron-
ko Nagurski, and Center ‘Ed Sul-
livan.

Nagurski In Top Form

Sullivan, C0-captain, is a senior
from McKeesport. The double-
monogram winner has been out
for the past couple of weeks with
a bad ankle, but like Lewis will
be ready for the Panthers.

_ Nagurski was preceded to
Notre Dame by his all-Ameri.

‘can father’s reputation, but has
now shown that he can play the
grid game without his pater’s
rep. s

Saturday’s rivalry dates back to
1909. In these 48 years the teams
have played 23 times, the Irish
winning 15 times with one tie
thrown in.

yards for one score and later was on the receiving end of a
50-yard scoring pass as Penn State’s freshmen beat the Pan-
ther Cubs, 13-7, at University Park.

Both Lion touchdowns came in the second period. Kerr
opened the scoring as he took a handoff from Quarterback

Dick Hoak of Jeannette and racedﬁ

80 yards. Hoak then proceeded to
hit Kerr with the 50-yard scoring
pass and Bob Wasko of Swoyers—
ville added the point.

Quarterback John Sakal of
Aliquippa passed 40 yards to his
high school team mate Mike Dit-
ka for the Panther touchdown
early in the third quarter.

Worrell Stoped

With the exception of the sec-
ond period the Jungle Cats did
everything but push the Lions in-
to the ground. The Panthers lead
in both passing and rushing yard-
age. However, the gridders were
never able to come up with the
right play at the right time.

The Blue and Gold line, which
has been troubled by injuries
and the ﬂu, contained State's
backs quite well. Red Worrell,
the lad from Centerville who
made every high school all-
American team, was stopped
cold by the Panther’ line.

Standouts on defense for the
Panthers were Ron Delﬁne, Elmer
Merkovsky, Bob Leith, Rich ..Mat-
yus, and Jim. Cunningham; “Pitt
did everything but win the game,”
commented injured guard Bob
Guzik. Guzik is out for the season
with a broken foot.

Plebes Powerful

The Panthers came out of the
encounter in perfect shape. With
the surprisingly ﬁne line play
that they showed, the year-lings
ﬁgure that they have a good

Hoopsters Start
lnitial Drills

Twenty hopeful candidates in-
cluding three returning lettermen
greeted basketball coach Bob Tim-
mons Oct. 15 as the Panther ﬂoor
men began initial work outs in
preparation for the home opener
with Michigan Dec. 4.

The likeable Panther coach
will have his work cut out in
improving upon last year’s rec-
ord of 16-11 as he has put three
returning lettermen from last

year’s squad. Returning are co-
captains Chuck Hursh and Julius
Pegues, both two year letter-
men, and Junior Don Hennon.
Hennon was a sophomore sen-
sation last season as he led the
team in scoring with 573 points.

Timmons will also have trouble
replacing his two “big men” from
previous years—center iBob Laor
and forward John Riser. They
were the highest scorers in Pitt
history, and both were valuable
as rebound men. Vying to replace
these two are Dave Sawyer, a 6-6
junior center and John Mills 6-5
sophomore. Mills, a strong re-
bounder, is the only yearling ex-
pected to break into the starting
linup this year.

The schedule for the upcoming
season is as follows:

chance to upset the Navy Plebes
at Annapolis on Friday afternoon.

The Navy frosh, who defeat-
ed the Panthers last season,
have another powerful team
this year. Last year the Middies
were undefeated, and also shut
out the Army freshman.

The main reason for the great
success at Annapolis is the great
wealth of material that is present.
Each year thousands of high
school stars apply for appoint-
ments to the academy.

The boys who are selected us-
ually turn out to .be the cream of
the crop.

The Panther squad will leave
for Annapolis on Thursday. They
will tour the academy as guests
of Navy and then will return to
Pittsburgh early Saturday morn-
mg.

Swarnis May Sink
On Panther Choice
For “Alma Mater”

The sinking yogis are all look-
ing for a way to catch the nearest
boat to China after a poor show-
ing that saw speedy Scherer and
discolorful Cook take selection
honors for the week. Both had a
4-5 record.

Maniac Marino missed the boat
by picking Oshkosh instead of
Whitewater State to end up with
a 3-6 slate. Now crazy ﬁngers Jim
is going back to his old source of
information namely Ray-Me-Do,
the shady lady from naughty lane.

Charm Koltiska and D. (De-
linquent, R. Breakstone are still

battling for the broom to sweep
out the basement cafeteria as
they both showed up with glow-
ing 2-7 records. Now Koltiska
is going out for a new charm
before impeachment proceed-
ings begin taking place.
Breakstone claims that he has
ﬁnally found the secret of success
and will begin a new frame next
week. He secretly sneaked over to
Ellsworth Center and took a
course from Coach Michelosen
called “Ten Easy Lessons in Pick-
ing Football Winners.”

Colorful Beano Cook, the
Panther publicity agent, who
picks up more publicity about
himself than the team, stayed
true in his course by picking all
the underdogs. Beano who makes
only one appearance in the Yogi
column per year has followed

through with this policy and has
come out on top every time. From
the latest reports we're told that
“Colorful” is getting secret infor-
mation from a private source in
California. \

This week the Swamis are
honored with the presence of

Coach. Vic (Among the top ten
best dressed coaches in the
country) Fusia and Jim Theo-
dore. If they end up with worse,
if that’s possible, records’ than
Koltiska and Breakstone there
will be a unanimous decision‘
made to keep them as perma-
nent guests.

The experts are shooting their
wad in this selection as they all
decided to go down the river to-
gether in picking the purring
Panthers over the level-headed
Irish.

IF you’re a “take charge guy” . . . the kind of man who can work
with a team but one who can “run with the ball”, too, then the
Pennsylvania electrical utilities are looking for you.

Right now, one of the greatest challenges in industry is to be

found in the electric utility ﬁeld.

It is the electric industry upon

which the future expansion and prosperity of our country depends
. . . it is the electric industry which has more than doubled its ca-
pacity in the past ten years, and will double again in the next ten.

If you are looking for a job offering a pioneering challenge with

a dynamic future . . . a job that’s

limited only by your own capa-

bilities, then talk to your placement counselor or to the personnel
director of one of Pennsylvania’s electric power companies; or
write to Pennsylvania Electric Association, State Street Build-
ing, Harrisburg, Pa., telling them where you would like to live

and work!

Litchfield Aniionnces New Dean  

Of Public, International Affairs

Dr. Edward H. Litchfield has announced the appoint-
ment of Dr. Donald C. Stone, president of Springfield College

in Massachusetts, as dean of

the new Graduate School of

Public and International Affairs.
Glenn W. Ferguson, who for the past year has been ad-
ministrative assistant to Dr. Litchﬁeld, will be assistant clean.

The new School has been estab-O

lished to help meet the nation’s
critical need for men and women
educated for leadership careers in
public service.

Dean Stone and ‘Mr. Fergu-
son are laying the foundation
for a School which will, in the
words of Dr. Litchﬁeld, “train
administrators, rather than spe-
cialists, in such areas as public
management, recreation, plan-
ning, conservation, education,
public works, and voluntary
community services.”

According to Dean Stone, this
first year will be oneof planning
and development. First, a perma-
nent faculty must be recruited.

Second, ‘a curriculum must be set

up. In addition, Dean Stone is
formulating a fellowship program
for the first students to enroll in
the School.

These would be available to
some of the applicants accepted in
the first class, which is scheduled
for the fall of 1958.

Dr. Stone hopes to have a large
