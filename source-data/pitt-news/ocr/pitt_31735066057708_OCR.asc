Facing the consequences

State, campus penalties vary for underage drinkers

By Eric M. Smith
Staff Writer

(Editor's note: This is the
second of a three-part series
on underage drinking. )

The state of Pennsylvania
and the University of
Pittsburgh agree in theory on
the subject of underage
drinking: don’t. In practice,
however, each takes a differ-
ent approach.

While the state mandates
penalties for those caught
breaking the prohibition
against underage drinking,
the university stresses, pre-
vention and treatment rather
than sanctions. Each semes-
ter, only a handful of the
100-plus underage students
caught drinking actually go
through the state judicial sys-

tem; the rest remained within

the university system and‘

faced few or no sanctions.

In 1988, the Pennsylvania
State Legislature changed the
penalties for underage drink-
ing toward the end of manda-
tory sentencing for various
offenses.

Togive the law some teeth,
the state went after one of the
most important rewards of
young adulthood —— the dri-
ver’s license. If you’re
caught violating the underage
drinking prohibition, you can
keep the license: you can use
it as a bookmark. First
offenses carry a mandatory
suspension of driver privi-
leges of 90 days, while two-
time offenders lose it for a
year. Any more offenses
equal a loss of the license for

two years. If the offender
doesn’t have a license. the
penalty equals a delay in the
application for a driver’sper-
mit. A

“The judges’ hands are
tied. It’s written right in the
law thatthe courts have no
discretion on sentencing,”
said Stan Yurich, an officer
assigned to the State Police
Liquor Control Enforcement
Department.

According to statute, it is
illegal for anyone under the
age of 21 to possess, pur-
chase, transport or consume
“any liquor or malt or
brewed beverages.” In addi-
tion to the loss of license, a
fine between $25 and $300 is
issued along with $75 for
court costs, said Yurich.
Parental notification is also

mandatory, regardless of age.
A second offense can bring a
fine of $500.

It is illegal to misrepresent
your age — period. Simply
lying to the bouncer at your
favorite hot spot is the same
as showing a false identifica-
tion card. Both have the
same penalty. Second offens-
es get the $500 reminder.

Pitt has a different plan. If
caught on campus drinking,
the average underage student
gets the choice of either pay-
ing a $25 fine or attending a
three-part seminar on the
dangers of his or her choice.
The state is not notified.
Parents are not notified. The
license is not suspended.

Committee looks‘
into computer lab  
availability problem

By Chris Lombardo
For The Pitt News

The scene is all too familiar
for Pitt students, especially
this time of year. You go to
one computer lab after the
next, only to find them all full.

This is no surprise consider-
ing that Pitt’s undergraduate
population is 24,302 students
and that it has around 530 PCs
available for students at seven
computer labs. The other
7,470 systems linked to
PittNet are used by faculty,
‘libraryand other university
employees.

But according to the
Executive Committee for
Academic Computing Chair
Norman Hummon, those con-
ditions may soon change.
Hummon is a university soci-
ology professor who heads the
l6—member group.

During ECAC’s last meet-
ing, the committee hammered
out a list of guidelines and
suggestions, both immediate
and long-term, to aid in reduc-

ing the overcrowding at
Computing and Information
Services labs.

According to a recent study
done by ECAC, Pitt has seen a
100 percent growth in comput-
er lab population since last
year ,

“We’ve been aware of how
populated the labs have
become all semester. We must
do something about it,”
Hummon said.

An immediate measure
ECAC has implemented in
cooperation with CIS is install
a system that tells each lab
worker how many Mac, UNIX
or IBM systems are in use in
that lab. The program also
tells what is available in other
CIS labs, so the lab consultant
can suggest a less crowded lab
to waiting students.» The sys-
tem will recount and update its
information every half hour.

ECAC has also sent out a
memo to the deans of Pitt’s

schools asking them to open

their non-CIS labs to the gen-

Pitt office he/ps both veteran and disabled students

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

The name sounds deceiving, but the
Office of Veterans and Disabled Student
Services is actually two separate offices

operating under the same roof.

The Office of Veteran Services and the

Office of Disabled Student Services were
combined to form one office, but each
performs very different, but important
services for many University of
Pittsburgh students.

The Office of Veteran Services acts as
a liaison between the University of
Pittsburgh and the Department of

Veteran Affairs regional offices in
Pittsburgh and Buffalo, New York.

“Our purpose is to process paperwork
for the 300-plus veterans and their

dependents who attend the University of

Pittsburgh,” said office coordinator Don
Graffius.

(Dr. Robert Gallagher is the
director of Pitt ’s counseling

office. )

On Nov. 1, 1994, Dr. Leon
Haley asked me to form a task
force to study the extent of
alcohol abuse on the Pitt cam-
pus and to offer recommenda-
tions for addressing this prob-
lem. Less than two weeks later
a Pitt student died of alcohol
poisoning. This tragic event
has shaken the campus com-
munity and heightened the
feeling of responsibility for
those who have agreed to
serve on this task force.

When asked if I thought the
problem is worse now than
when I went to school, I
answered probably not.
Drinking was as much a part

of university life then as it is
now, and I wish that I could
report that I was one of the
moderate drinkers. I wasn’t. I
enjoyed myself but
somehow got through
this period of my life
relatively unscathed.
My experience, I
believe, was shared by
a number of other peo-
ple who are now uni-
versity faculty mem-
bers, administrators or
staff.

So why are we now
pointing our fingers at
young people and telling them
they shouldn’t drink so much?
The answer, of course, is that
much more is known about the
downside of excessive drink-
ing. Actually, the evidence

Apart from our knowledge

that approximately 28 per-
cent of all student dropouts are
linked to alcohol abuse and
that the grade point average of
students is negatively corre-
lated with alcohol usage. We
know that somewhere around
300,000 of the nation’s current
12 million undergraduates will
ultimately die fromgalcohol-
related causes — more than
the number that will get their

Long term solutions,
according to Hummon, have
already begun to take shape.
ECAC has approved the pur-
chase of 24 new personal
computers, and Hummon said
they hope to do more buying
soon. Hummon also said he
would like to increase the
number of devices by 60 per-

“They’re sitting in storage
or unplugged and ignored,”
Hummon said. He suggested
using these systems with only
basic functions like word pro-
cessing programs and e-mail.
A CIS ‘survey concluded that

about 80 percent of lab users
are there to use WordPerfect
or send and retrieve e-mail.

Hummon said he believes
that common courtesy can
also help ease the overcrowd-
ing —- especially during the
end of the semester. He urged
students to do course-related
work at the labs and save the
casual use for early in the
term.

“People who spend hours
communicating to their
friends by e-mail often don’t

reasons.”

ECAC and CIS have also
discussed limiting computer

ing or selling of alcohol to
minors.

“We are not beyond turning
the individual over to the
authorities,” said Donham, in
reference to repeat offenders
and students who do not dis-
play cooperation. I

This seems to work in both
directions. Donham said that
one year, six students caught
by the police and placed in
front of the local magistrate
were turned over to the uni-
versity for enforcement.

“It’s accepted by local
authorities that we treat
[alcohol abuse] seriously,” he
said.

Detective Pamela Wright of
the Pittsburgh Police
Nuisance Bar Task Forces
described the realities of
enforcement.

“We don’t do too much
unless we get a call for it,”

-said Wright.

Working in cooperation
with the university and state
police, the task force concen-

- trates mainly on bars that

have received five or more
complaints from citizens,
groups or police officers.

Both Wright and Yurich
explained that their depart-
ments are allowed total dis-
cretion regarding investiga-
tion. Periodically they con-
duct unannounced raids
which are termed “monitor-
ing,” but the vast majority of
investigations are aimed at
bars that have attracted nega-
tive attention to themselves.
Neither would comment on
the specific frequency of
these raids.

Pitt’s assistant director of
Public Safety, Gary Moses,
explained the university’s
different approach.

“We obviously respond to
complaints, but the majority
of arrests is based on officer
initiative,” said Moses.

All underage drinkers

apprehended by the universi-
ty police, whether in a resi-
dence hall room or on the
street, are issued a citation
for an, appearance in front of
the local magistrate, and the
alcohol is seized.
* Moses said the local magis-
trate has the final say in
whether the charges are
referred to the state or turned
over to the judicial board of
the university. He did not
have all the statistics pertain-
ing to underage drinking, but
he recalled that 18 arrests
were made last semester for
that offense. The magistrate
may refer the students back
to Pitt for admittance in
the PEAR program, but
the state . is ' notified
regarding the license suspen-
sion.

Maurer responded to the
leniency afforded to the vast
majority: ‘‘I think more stu-
dents should go in front of
the magistrate.”

The bottom line is that very
few Pitt students face the
legal consequences of under-
age drinking.

ues in Bosnia, and recently it has taken another turn for the
worse. During the summer, the United States and other NATO
countries, primarily led by Britain and France; gave the Serbs an
ultimatum: either except their proposed peace treaty or else. The
peace treaty would have granted 49 percent of Bosnia to the
Bosnian Serbs, giving the remaining 51 percent to the Muslim-
led Bosnian government and allied Croats. This would have
required the Serbians to give up large amounts of territory, as
they held approximately 70 percent at the time. They chose the
“or else” option.

So far “or else” has been pretty good to the Serbians. They
have continued to gobble up Bosnian territory, and will soon
take over the city of Bihac, which had been declared a safe area
by the United Nations (to be implemented by NATO). The other
safe areas include Sarajevo and four other Bosnian cities.

Why has the “or else” option been so good for the Serbians?
It is certainly not because of the lack of NATO military power,
but instead because of the unwillingness to use it, political bick-
erings between the member nations and the further unwilling-
ness to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims (yes, the
side the U.N., NATO and the U.S. ostensibly supports). In the
U.S. there has been considerable pressure to lift the arms embar-
go, to strongly defend the U.N.—declared safe areas and to carry
out the “or else” threat of the summer. However, Britain and
France have been vehemently opposed to this policy, and it has
caused a great stretching of tensions. The United States’ rela-
tions with Britain are at their lowest since the 1956 Suez crisis.

It was the U.S. who was the first to blink. It has dropped talk
of using air strikes and other forms of military pressure to halt
Serbian attacks and compel them to agree to the settlement. This
merely confirms what the Serbians had already discovered --
that the threats of the U.S. and NATO need not be taken at face
value.

The implications of this both for the present tragedy and for
future crises/wars is ominous. For the Bosnian war, this means
an end to hostilities is not likely to come soon, for why should
Serbia not simply continue to gather territory. Also, if there is a
quick end, it would necessarily require massive concessions to
the Serbs, which is in effect a reward for continuing aggression
and an ignoring of the will of Europe and the United States. And
what does this tell other countries or dictators who may contem-
plate engaging in wars or genocide in the near future? Basically,
as long as you don’t do something stupid, like threaten oil sup-
plies, you can do whatever you want and only face condemna-
tion and empty threats.

It is time for the nations of the world, especially Britain and
France, to back up their hollow threats and weak condemna-
tions. The arms embargo should be lifted so the Muslims at least
have an equal chance to defend ‘themselves, and at the very least
NATO should launch air strikes on Serbian positions threatening
U.N.-designated safe areas.

I the lesser dangers of drink-

Underage drinking

8 I absolutely cannot believe
that a band of Hard Copy
wannabe Pitt students is run-
ning around Oakland expos-
ing all those bars that allow
underage students into their
premises.

Kevin Kramer seems to be
the lead sleuth in a battle
against the bars. The bars
that were “caught” are cer-
tainly college bars. However,
the bars in question are
designed to pack in huge
crowds that have been under
mounds of stress and want to
release, kick back and have
some fun. But Mr. Kramer‘
and Co., how many people
drive away from these bars?
The great majority walks
safely back to dorms and
apartments, don’t you agree?

The real danger is drinking
and driving. I’m surprised
that issue wasn’t of more
concern to you. I believe
these bars actually do the
community a service. Maybe
you should try this experi-
ment with the bars and clubs
on Pittsburgh’s South Side.
If you find that young people
are being allowed in over
there, then that’s a legitimate
problem.

As a response to the recent
death of a student from alco-
hol poisoning, I guess
it’s politically correct to
start addressing this is-
sue now. But as I’m sure
many students will agree,
alcohol poisoning is one of

ing. Almost all of us know
someone who has been
affected by a drinking and
driving accident.
Unfortunately, after this
article many bars will proba-
bly change their practices,
and lots of freshmen, sopho-
mores and some juniors will
be hanging around campus
instead of around bars. And

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

especially with the plethora
of wholesome, night-time
student activities here at Pitt,
we’ll see thousands of stu-
dents with nothing‘to do,
searching for outlets to burn
their energy. Well, at least
I’m 21. I can go hide in a
bar. Look out Mr. Kramer.

Meeting coverage

I find it amusing that The
Pitt News felt that the length
of Monday night’s Student
Government Board meeting
was the most important item
mentioned.

The 1994 Student
Government Board attended
over 100 meetings in its first
100 days in office and is
keenly aware of busy
schedules and how to have
efficient, complete meetings.
The fact that we did not
drag out the meeting is a
tribute to the organization in
SGB.

At Brandeis University,
for example, it is not un-
common for public
Student Senate meetings
to last over two hours.
Here at Pitt, SGB meets pri-
vately prior to the Public
Meeting to discuss and ana-
lyze all important pieces of
business. We recognize that
students do not have time to
waste.

However. The Pitt News
failed to accurately report on
what was discussed. This
may be because News Editor
Stephen Kozarovich was not
present (as he often is). Here
are some of the items

In addition, The Pitt News
incorrectly reported on
‘computer censorship. On
December 16, Executive
Committee on _ Academic
Computing will discuss a
proposal to separate elec-
tronic newsgroups into two
sections: a complete list off
all of the newsgroups that
Pitt supports and a listing
that does not include groups
that Pitt feels are
obscene/sexually explicit.
If this is approved and
implemented, it will allow
members of the university
community to choose not to
be exposed to the
obscene/sexually explicit
electronic bulletin boards,
and prevent minors who are
guests at the university from
receiving those images and
files.

After every Student
Government Board meeting
all Board members and
Committee Chairs are
free and willing to comment
and elaborate on anything
said during the meeting. The
Pitt News knows this, and
yet continues to mess up.
Maybe they should be elect-
ed?

or most
college
basket-

ball fans, one
of the happi-
est days of
the year is
when the

football sea-
Brett son draws to
Fondrk a close. It

means that

hoops season is right around
the corner. ‘

This is especially true here
at Pitt as students look for-
ward Ralph Willard’s inau-
gural year as men’s basket-
ball coach. Willard is a solid
coach and has amassed a
stellar recruiting class that
will make Pitt a contender in
as little as a year from now.

But regardless of how
Willard does, or who is on
the court, fans will show up.
This point was proven after
last season. Paul thank-god- V
he’s-gone Evans and his bor-
ing style of play stunk up the
Field House so bad last sea-
son that it’s a wonder fans
could, stand to stay in the
building. But like true die-
hard hoop fans, they watched
the team lose till the bitter -
end. I went to every game,
and at times the Panthers
were downright pathetic. It
goes to show you that, win or
lose, fans will support you.
Dribble a ball up and down
the court, and spectators will
ﬂock — if you are a male.

What these blind hoops
fans missed, as they faithful-
ly followed the downfall of
the men, was one of the best
seasons ever in won1en’s bas-
ketball at Pitt. In the‘ same
Field House in which the
men’s team was finding a
way to lose, the women were
finding a way to win en route
to a 21-10 record and a berth
in the women’s National
Invitational Tournament.

The stellar play of the
Lady Panthers was over-
looked as fans flocked to see
the men lose and ignored
coach Kirk Bruce and his
team’s success.

The problem is that many
people have never seen a col-
legiate women’s game. What
keeps most detractors of
women’s hoops away is the
misconception that the games
are slow and boring. While it
is true that the game is not as
quick, it far from slow, and it
is anything but boring.

Another gripe is that the
game is played below the

Pitt turns it over on

By Jack Becker
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

If size, depth and injuries
weren’t enough to overcome, the
Pitt Panthers located an entirely
new hindrance with which to
strap themselves against No. 2
North Carolina Tar Heels in the
Dean Dome. Pitt turned the ball
over 25 times, lending its hand to
the Tar Heels’ 90-67 victory last
night.

North Carolina exhibited too
much Rasheed Wallace, who
scored 30’ points, and fed on
rnistimed Panther passes to drive

on a game-breaking 19-point run _

that bridged halftime.
“We’re wearing down physi-

cally. We really are,” Pitt coach ’

Ralph Willard said in a post-
game radio interview. “It’s gonna
take time for the kids to learn to
play through fatigue.”

After trailing .38-30 at half-
time, Pitt promptly assisted the
Tar Heels to a 46-30 advantage
by yielding steals on its first
three possessions of the second
half. Sotiris Aggelou ended the
run with a three-pointer, one of
the Panthers’ 12 on the night, but
North Carolina never looked
back.

Pitt was picked apart by the
Tar Heels’ talented sophomores.
The Panthers didn’t ﬁnd anyone
to lay a body on Wallace, who
roamed free for rebound dunks
and alley oops throughout the
game. Forward Jerry Stackhouse,
17 points, prowled through the
Panthers’ passing lanes for easy

steals and breakaway layups.

North Carolina’s trapping
man-to-man defense forced Pitt
and point guard Andre Alridge,
10 points, into ill-advised passes.

“We got some panic in our
eyes, and panic can turn the ball
over,” Willard said. “Andre is
learning. The decision making is
bad, but I attribute that to fatigue
and lack of experience.”

The Panthers awoke midway
through the second half with a
burst of three-point shooting that
repressed the final margin from
stretching further. Garrick

Thomas came off the bench to

score all his 17 points in the sec-
ond half and led Pitt in a 41-per-
cent, three-point shooting perfor-
mance. The Panthers, however,
shot only 38 percent from- the
field.

In the first half, Pitt surprised
the Tar Heels by pampering a
slim lead for the opening 12 min-
utes. Jaime Peterson, l2 points,
was active inside against
Wallace, scoring Pitt’s ﬁrst eight
points. The Panthers extended
their lead to a high of seven on
two different occasions, thanks to
three—pointers by Alridge and
Jason Maile.

North Carolina claimed the
advantage 16-15 on a tl1ree—point
play by Donald Williams, but
Pitt soon recoiled. «

Back-to-back buckets by
Alridge and three—pointers from
Aggelou and Maile delivered the
Panthers a 28-24 edge. However,
after an Aggelou layup at the
three minute 30 second mark, the

Lady Panthers finish third at UNLV Tourney’

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team finished in a disap-
pointing third place at the
7UP-Desert Classic hosted by
UNLV over the weekend.

The Lady Panthers’ first
game was against Arkansas, a
strong team in a strong con-
ference — the Southeastern.
The contest was a barnburn-
er, at the least.

The Lady Panthers trailed
73-72 in a
back-and-

  forth strug-
gle with
five sec-
o n d s
remaining.
J u n i o r
guard Stephanie Petho scored
with 4.7 seconds left to give
the Lady Panthers a 74-73
lead.

“After that basket we didn’t
cover the floor well,” said
head coach Kirk Bruce. “I
thought we had the game
won.”

Pitt, who had relinquished a
12-point second-half lead, let
Arkansas score the winning
basket. The heartbreaking
loss was tough to swallow for
Pitt, who had to face Texas-
Arlington in the consolation

game.

“We played very well, but
we did make some mistakes,”
Bruce said. “Arkansas is a
good team. Last year they
beat Alabama, who went to
the Final Four.”

Bruce said, “unless we win a
couple.”

Bruce /ands two recruits

The Lady Panthers women’s basketball coach Kirk
Bruce received two national letters-of-intent to attend Pitt

Bruce landed a 5-foot—3-inch point guard from
Washington Township High School in Sewell, N.J. and 6-2
forward Kortni Webb from St. Francis Academy in

“This is a good group to bring in,” Bruce said in a press
release. “Each of these girls bring something different to
our program, which is important, since we’ll be looking to
replace Jenine Joyce and Carol Morton next season.”

Webb as a junior averaged 12 points and 13 rebounds
and was an All-Baltimore City and All—Catholic selection.

Nelson averaged double figures in scoring last season,
and she will be a four-year starter.

Senior co-captain Jenine
Joyce led Pitt with 16 points.
Petho notched 14, and sopho-
more center Melissa
Thompson had 12.

Freshman Latia Howard
collected eight boards to lead
Pitt, while a quartet of Lady
Panthers pulled in four
boards apiece.

said the two close losses have
something to do with Pitt’s
lack of experience. Half of
the team is composed of
freshmen and sophomores.
The Lady Panthers had to

"put the memories of the

Arkansas loss behind them in

order to finish in third place.
Pitt came out and con-

trolled the consolation game

against Texas-Arlington, win-
ning 74-64.

“We didn’t know much
about either team,” Bruce
said. “It was difficult to get
motivated, because it was the
consolation game.”

The Lady Panthers shot the
ball well and avoided costly
mistakes. Bruce credits senior
point guard and co-captain
Carol Morton and also Joyce
and Petho for triggering the
play of the entire team.

“Morton played a good sec-
ond half, and Joyce and Petho
were magnificent,” Bruce
said.

Joyce and Petho both
pumped in a game—high 19
points apiece.

Howard once again led the
Lady Panthers in rebounding
with another game—high 12
boards.

“I was pleased with the
overall performance of the

team in both games,” Bruce '

said.

The win, however, still left
a bittersweet taste in Pitt’s
mouth. Arkansas, who nar-
rowly escaped Pitt’s clutches,
won the tournament by
defeating the host team,
UNLV, by 18 points.

“I felt that we should have
won this tournament,” Bruce

said.

Winning the tournament
would have been a big boost
to the Lady Panthers, whose
record now stands at 1-1.

The next couple games
could determine what type of
season lies ahead for the
Lady Panthers.

Tomorrow Pitt travels down

Fifth Avenue to play home-
town rival Duquesne.

“Last year we beat them, so
they’ll be gunning for us.
They have improved over last
year,” Bruce said.

Following the Duquesne
game is what will probably
be Pitt’s toughest match
of the year. On Sunday, Dec.
4, No. 10 Penn State travels

to the Fitzgerald Field House.

“Right now we’re just con-
centrating on the Duquesne
game, although Penn State
will be a very tough game,”
Bruce said.

The Lady Panthers, who
were predicted to finish sev-
enth in the Big East coaches
poll, open their conference
season at Syracuse on Dec. 7.

rim. No dunks, no fans.
Think about it like this: what
percentage of an average fan
can really dunk a ball? In
fact, how many fans have
actually played organized
ball and can figure out what
is really happening on the
court? If fans would pay
attention to the actual game,
and not be dazzled by an
occasional rim rattler, they
would find that the men’s
style of play and that of the
women’s are really pretty
much the same. Both teams
will be relying on the fast
break offensively and
constant pressure defensive-

ly.
My personal feeling is that

I the men’s games are more of

a social thing than the actual
love of the game. Thirty per-
cent of the students are either
stumbling drunk or at least
buzzed when they go to the
weekend games. Most seem

more interested in who they
will see inthe stands as
opposed to what is happen-
ing on the court.

But to all of you out there
who really love the game,
take some time to check out
the women. You won’t see
packed stands full of drunks
or a dunk. What you will see
is an exciting, fast-paced and
competitive game. The
women would appreciate
your support, and you may
actually see a win. A good
time to check out a game
would be Sunday afternoon
when the Lady Panthers face
nationally ranked Penn State
3:00 p.m. at the Field House.
Everyone hates Penn State,
and most students don’t do
anything Sunday afternoon
anyway. So get off your butt
and hike up to the game. You
may actually like what you
see.
