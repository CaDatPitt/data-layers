Parking lots closed

Staff Writer

For those commuters who
thought that getting a spot in the
OC lot every morning was hard
enough, things are going to be
a little worse next week. Ninety

' parking spaces will be off-lirnits
to make way for volunteers
working at the Chautauqua at
Pitt conference from Oct. 30 to
Nov. 3.

“Unfortunately this is the only

students from the O’Hara lot,
but the physicians’ lot is open to
the public, and it is quite
possible that students regularly
park there," said Thomas.
There are normally 862 spaces
available each day on the OC
lot, and Miller said that the
spaces that the conference will
use should not have a large
impact on the student
commuters.

said Janet Thomas, assistant

Kathy Miller, program
manager for the University of

said that spaces in private lots
on campus can cost anywhere
from $3 to $6, depending on the
location. Students with an I.D.
can park in the OC lot or the
Panther Hollow lot for $2 per
klay.

“My first thought is that

tudents ought to consider taking
the bus during these few days. It
will certainly be more cost—
effective. Parking is a problem
as it is, without this extra burden,"
Miller said. '

In addition to the spots in the
OC lot, 65 spaces in the
physicians’ lot and the roof level
of the O'Hara lot will also be
closed off for the conference.

Miller said.

Miller said that part of the
parking problems are caused
by students who unnecessarily
bring their cars on campus.

“Students who live in
Shadyside or Squirrel Hill and
bring their cars are just plain
foolish. They are simply wasting
their money. Most students I’ve
met are just lazy. They want
someone to hand them a
solution on a platter,” said Miller.

Miller said that the ride-share

who have problems finding

“We match commuters in the

many other organizations, according to Nicole.

Issues on which the candidates commented

Greek Week will be held from
March 23 to 31. The money will
be raised by the fraternities in
two major events. The brothers
will be collecting donations in
cans from January until the end
of Greek Week, and will hold a
dance marathon. St. Francis
employees will be involved as
judges for the events.

St. Francis was chosen out of
20 applicants to be this year’s
charity. “We send a cover sheet
and applications to 20 charities
that are interested in being our

Greek Week charity. We go over
the applications and pick the
top five. Those five are
interviewed. From there we
choose the charity,” said
O’Rourke. '

The rapport between the
charity and the Greeks is
important. “We are basically
looking for the best overall
working relationship,” he said.
“We are going to have an
excellent relationship. Their

the way they help the

St. Francis chose to apply to
be the Greek Week charity
because “we heard how [well]
they had done with their charities
in the past,” said Dombrowiak.

The goals for this year’s Greek
Week events are ambitious. They
hope to raise $100,000 for the
hospital and 2,600 pints of blood
for the Central Blood Bank. “This
year there will be a lot of
involvement and a lot of spirit,”
said O’Rourke. “The goals are
very obtainable.”

V the programming

Students can watch USSR programs

By Marcy Lightfoot
For The Pitt News

Pitt students who are tired of
watching syndicated re-runs on
television have recently been
offered an alternative from the
university Department of Slavic
Languages and Literatures.

Students can watch live Soviet
television daily from
approximately 1 to 4 p.m. in the
Slavic Department Library, Room
1452 of the Cathedral of Learning.

According to Dr. Oscar Swan,
chairman of the Department of
Slavic Languages and Literatures,
includes
primarily news and discussion
shows, but also game shows and
occasionally soap operas. The
programs shown are comparable
to what thesoviets are viewing
from about 8 p.m. to midnight.

“We never know exactly what
to expect,” Swan said. .“The signal
is beautiful and the sound is
good. It is no worse than watching
local television.” ‘

The satellite dish that is located
on top of Forbes Quadrangle
came into operation last
December. The cost of the dish
and its installation was
approxima_tely $70,000, according
to Swan, and was partly funded
through the state’s Ben Franklin
Partnership Program.

“We were not the ﬁrst university
to get this,” Swan said. “The
satellite dish is not just used for
Soviet television reception. It can
also be — used for
teleconferencing.” , V

Soviet programs were originally
taped and used in the classroom
to help students learn the Russian
language. Swan saidhe feels that
viewing foreign television is a
more effective means of teaching
a foreign language than listening
to a recording. W

“Language [on TV] is always
used in a personal and cultural
context that is impossible to
recreate,” Swan said. _

« According to , Swan, other
language departments are

interested in getting their own
live reception. Other language

professors currently use tapes of 8

programs that were recorded
while being aired in other
countries.

“It is harder to visit the Soviet
Union than any of the other
language areas, and more difﬂcult
to tape programs there,” Swan
said. A

The Soviet signal may start
getting scrambled sometime next
year, said Swan. According to
Swan, the Soviet satellite that is
used for reception may eventually
be phased out because of the
high cost to the Soviet Union.
“Right now, they are only keeping
it going because of requests in
the West,” Swan said. 6

Swan said students who have
no knowledge of the Russian
language can still enjoy viewing
Soviet television. “You could
probably understand about 15
percent of what’s going on
because of visual cues,» even if
you don’t know the language."-

When you start  
your career, there’s

  nothing like initial success.

Classes prepare students for graduate school tests

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

Going to graduate school
means more application
deadlines, more entrance
examinations and last, but
deﬁnitely not least, more money.
After four years of college,
students may not want to have

 these worries, even if graduate

school is a viable option.

However, many students do
not realize that Pitt offers ways to
help them get into the graduate
school of their choice.

A good place to start is the
Office of Measurement and
Evaluation in G33 of the Cathedral

of Learning. Here one canfind .

applications for practically every
graduate test available. Some of
the applications on ﬁle include:

The GMAT (Graduate
Management Admission Test),
GRE (Graduate Record

Examination), LSAT (Law School
Admissions Test), MCAT (Medical
College Admissions Test), TOEFL
(Test of English as a Foreign
Language) and PTCPT
(Pennsylvania Teachers Test).
Representatives from the Office

_ of Measurement and Evaluation

report that of the tests, the GRE is
the most common with 3,800
total applications issued this year

» alone. Most of the tests are given

four times per year, with a few
like the MCAT being given twice

a year. The TOEFL is the test that g

is mosttoften taken more than

‘ once and is given 12times. per

1
 

- extremely beneficial.

year.

The next beneficial step would
be to consider taking a test
preparation workshop to prepare
you for the ' entrance exams
themselves. Many of these
workshops exist, but they can
also be expensive.

What many are not aware of is
that preparation workshops can
be economical and can exist close
to home — right here at Pitt, in
fact.

Pitt's College of General Studies
offers a set of these workshops
that prepare students for either
the GMAT, GRE, or the LSAT.
Maureen Stadley, associate
professor at Community College
of Allegheny County is one of the
instructors and feels that
participating in a workshop is
“The
advantage of a preparation course
is that [students] have already
taken the test. People who go
into these [graduate school exams]
cold, show a greater probability
of taking the tests again. The
class eliminates the [test taking]
anxiety,” she said. ,

The cost of all three workshops
is $95, as compared to other
classes such as the Stanley Kaplan,

which is a nationwide workshop » ’

costing $585 for the LSAT class,
$490 for the GRE class and $585
for the class to prepare people
for the GMAT.

The main goal of the classes is
to make people aware of test-

taking strategies and inform them

on how to practice taking the

I

workbook

exams. They use actual previous
tests as practice. “I cannot see
someone charging a large amount
[of money] merely for practice,”
said Stadley.

In addition to the $95 fee,
participants will also be required
to purchase the Barron’s
which is
approximately $14, ’ and the
expensive home practice tapes
provided by Stanley Kaplan are
very similar to the Barron’s book.
All three classes are given three
weeks to one month before the
actual test dates, with the final
class ending one week prior to
the test. Stadley advises registering
at least one week prior to the
beginning of ' the workshops.

When asked how Pitt’s class
compared to others like Stanley

Kaplan, she said that most people ,

are extremely satisfied with their
test results after taking the class.
The class also provides an
assurance that if you are not
satisfied with your first test score,
you can retake the entire
workshop at no cost. Stanley
Kaplan also offers the assurance.

“We are a smaller program so

we don’t have to charge as much,” .

said Stadley. “lStanley] Kaplan
has the nationwide overhead to
work with.” A

Since the start of Pitt’s
workshops in 1982, there has
been a signiﬁcantincrease in the
number of people taking the
classes. The LSAT workshop in
particular has shown an increase

in the amount of women taking _

“Sometimes the ratio of women

Chautauqua at Pitt

On Friday, Oct; 27, the University of Pittsburgh ceases _
to be just another university in an American city. On this
date, the students, faculty and U.S. leaders join together
in welcoming the Fifth General Chautauqua Conference

on U.S.-Soviet Relations. .

Chautauqua at Pitt, as it is called, will last for one full
week. Many Soviet and American personalities will be on
 hand to speak at the conference on a variety of subjects,

 such as. environmental issues, how the Americans and
Soviets view one another, women in contemporary
society and discussions on religious pluralism, to name ‘

but a few.

All scheduled events will b

e open to the public, which S
means that students will be able to take full «advantage of

this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

To have beenchos-en as the site of such a meeting is ’a»
distinct honor, one that must be taken to heart. We as
students can do our part by putting aside rash generaliza-
tions and stereotypes that havebeen ingrained into our
thinking about Soviet people and culture all of our lives.

This meeting, like the previous four, will play an
important role in bettering relations between the United
States and the Soviet Union. For oneweek, our role will ’
ﬁne longer be that of simply students — we will become

diplomats.

Since 1978 I have enjoyed the

all publications, I come across a
disturbing article. In your 16
Oct 1989 issue there was a letter
by a freshman (“Don’t believe
the hype”) that was particularly

lgdisturbing.

Some of the “facts” used in the

_ letter were superficial and did,

not support the apparent theme
of the letter (i.e. our presidents
are racists). Lincoln freed all
slaves in the U.S., not just the
South! Mentioning Egypt as alnl
economic and cultural power in
antiquity is, in fact, incriminat-
ing as well as complimentary to

g the black —— let's not forget the

pyramids were built with the
use of slave labor (Jews and
other blacks).

There is no question that ra-
cism is prevalent in America
both past and present. "But hey

Discrimination against lesbi-
ans

I just put down the Oct. 23
edition of your paper and I am
furious! How could such a bigot
as Rev. John Harvey be allowed

J on campus? Was he ofﬁcally

sanctioned by the university?
Was the person who booked
him made aware that the non-
discrimination policy at Pitt
includes sexual preference? If
such a person came on campus
tellingJews that they are sinners
because they killed Christ,[...l
he would be run out of town. If
he said that blacks bear the
mark of Cain,l...l do you think
that the African-American or-
ganizations would appreciate
your ‘printing such bigotry?[...l

The war on drugs has come to
Pittsburgh. The standard bearer
for this battle is the Pittsburgh
Public School System. Tired of
harboring drug addicts and deal-
ers disguised as students, the
system has decided to light back.

A new anti-drug policy en-
acted by the school board stipu-
lates that any student caught with
illegal drugs or weapons, on or’

off campus, will be expelled from g
school. This policy is not ex-.

pected to cure the drug problem.
It is, however, expected, to take
criminals out of the classroom
and put them on the streets.

This is where the Pittsburgh
B Police’, Organized Crime, Narcot-

ics and Intelligence unit comes
into the picture. When the crimi-
nals are in the classroom, the
police officers in the streets are
powerless against them. When

A the criminals are on the street,

the police can act.
The supposed innocence of
students “trying to get an educa-

As a lesbian, I am very of-
fended by such remarks as those

lesbian by some “childhood
experience.” According to my
opinion and the oﬂicial Catho-
lic dogma, I was born a lesbian.
Rev. Harvey, read your own
Church's writings!

Isn’t it special that part of his
“advice” is for homosexuals to
“live by the teachings of the
Catholic Church.” You can bet
that I don't practice birth con-
trol, or get an abortion, and, as
to the problem with premarital
sex, I'm not even allowed to
marry the person I love!

Once again, homophobic
behavior comes spilling out of
the Diocese of Pittsburgh.

much.”

tion” is a guardian angel for drug
offenders when they go into the

' courtroom. The criminal justice

system tends to show mercy on
students, assuming that the stu-
dentsare actually attending school
for the purpose of being edu-
cated.

 

Unfortunately for society, this
is a rather naive assumption. The
dregs of humanity are using their
status as students as a shelter

’ from justice. When these dealers

and addicts are exposed for what
they really are, the criminal jus-
tice system will treat them ac-
cordingly.

The new anti-drug policy is a
prime example _of how the vari-

scourge. _ The degeneratese in-

Life is great. The weather is
nice, my family is healthy, my
classes are going well and ex-PTL
ministerjim Bakker is on his way
to jail. What-more could I want
out of life? O.K., so maybe I
would like to see Tammy Faye
wear a Robin Givens costume
and step into the ring with an
angry Mike Tyson, but that would
be asking for too much. .
I can’t explainthe feeling that
I had when I heard that Jim
Bakker was guilty of multiple
charges of conspiracy and fraud.

It was sort of like putting lime ..

Jell-O down the front of my pants
and jumping up and down,. but
not quite as erotic.

Just for fun, let’s take a look at
Jim Bakker’s crimes and/or “sins”
shall we?

Jim Bakker exploited God for
purposes of becoming wealthy,
and that is morally wrong. He
used God to make himself rich.

That probably got him an all-
expense paid, one-way ticket to
Hell.

Jim Bakker stole money from
the church, and that is morally
and legally wrong. That proba-
bly made it an all-expenses paid,

 

one-way ticket on a Greyhound
bus to Hell; V

Jim Bakker allegedly raped
his secretary Jessica Hahn, then
tried to bribe her into keeping
quiet about the issue. I have a
hard time believing that Jessica
Hahn was raped, but then again,
I have a hard time believing-
anything associated with funda-
mentalists. *

Lastly, Jim Bakker is a whin-

ing, sniveling, little, ferret-faced
geek. The way he acted when
they busted him about Hahn was
sickening. At least Gary Hart was
like, “O.K., you got me. I did this
chick. But hey, she was hot.” But
not Bakker. No, Bakker is more
like, “God will  God has  God
did  God said ...” Give us a
break, Jim. God can’t help you
now -—— journalists are lining up
to take slap shots at you.

The Jim Bakker trial was dis-
gusting too. Tammy Faye singing
songs in front of the courthouse
and Jim acting like he was being
tortured. I'm surprised he didn’t
carry his briefcase -into court on
his back and wear a crown of
thorns.

Although Bakker was found
guilty of all of those things,
thereby qualifying him for “Mark
Stafs list of all-time buttheads," I
have to say thatl .ad'mire“the guy.
Think about it. Here’s this guy

who makes millions of dollars off
of a bunch of over-zealous, reli-
gious freaks who were stupid
enough to send him their money.
Jim Bakker, by being a cornball
fundamentalist and a lying swine,
conned thousands upon thou-
sands of sappy, brainwashed
people into buying him a ﬂeet of
cars, a collection of houses and
air conditioning for his « dog’s
house, thus making him one of
the countries wealthiest men.
Even Donald Trump's dog only

’has a ceiling fan.

The thing that upsets me the
most about the whole situation is
that I'm kicking myself for not
being as clever a‘con man as Jim
Bakker. I thought thatl was pretty
slick because I sold $450 worth
of elevator passes to freshmen
this term and I haven't paid my

. bill for my first three years at Pitt.

Then Bakker comes along and

Jealousy causes us to’ celebrate Jim Bakker's conviction

makes me look and feel like
small change. _ i ’

The public hates Jim Bakker.
The reason is that they are even
more jealous of Jim Bakke_r than
I am. Working class people bust
their heinies, day in and day out,
and still have nothing. They watch
Bakker step up and say some
garbage about God telling him
that we must send him money --
and some of us are so stupid that
we do it— and then we hate him.
We should hate ourselves. I know
I hate myself for not thinking of

it first.

By the way, if I don't raise
$10,000 by next term, the good
people of student ‘accounts are
going to call me home. So if you
could please send...

“ Oh, and let’s not forget the

The newdrin/eing rules “lead to some interesting scenes  

I wasn't too upset when I
heard about the all—new frater-
nity party procedures that
started this fall.-Since my fresh-

vman year, my attendance at
these parties has rapidly de-
clined. However, I have
checked out a few parties this
term, and I have to admit I’ve
been rather amused by the
scenarios resulting from the
enforcing of the “girls’ guest
list,” and “YES” and ‘-‘NO”
stamps. ’

I have a friend who has at-
tempted to get on one frater-
nity’s list for three consecutive
parties, only to find that it closes
three days in advance. Is some-
one trying to tell her some-
thing?

Just last weekend I witnessed
the nervous breakdown of a
girl who could not find her
name on her boyfriend’s list.
Oops — he must have forgot-
ten.

.I watched two little sisters

curse and swear all the way
down the hill when they found
out that their big brothers had
accidentally excluded them.
Goofed again!

I saw a girl with a “YES”
stamp get devious — while ‘it
was still wet, she pressed the
back of her hand against her
friend's. The friend proceeded
to wash out a ‘used cup in the

. bathroom, and then headed to

the bar to receive a beer with
her “SEY” stamp.

In the last few weeks, I have
seen two girls who were on the
list seriously weigh their op-
tions when they realized that
their three other friends were-
n't, and they couldn't convince
the guy working the door to let
their buddies in. “So, do you
guys want to wait outside for
awhile  or maybe we could
just meet you at the ‘O’ in two
or three hours?" .

At one fraternity that didn’t
seem to be checki.ng,I.D.s, I

heard a girl who didn’t get on
the list plotting and scheming‘
to sign in next to someone
else’s name. What if, an hour

’ later, this someone decides to

show up and proves she’s the
real “Peggy Sue Vekieshyug-
gel" —— with I.D.? There’s a
difficult one -—— especially if the
former young woman is al-
ready behind closed doors in a
room upstairs . I can picture it
. “Yo, ‘brother Sid (knock,
knock), it's pledge Sam, uh,
the girl in there with you ——-— uh
.. she’s uh  she’s uh -— a
fraud."

The best of all was the bar-
tender who said, “I can’t serve
you if you are marked ‘NO,”’ as
he handed the partier a froth-
ing beer. Yeah dude, way to
be.

It is rather obvious that this
whole stamp and list proce-
dure has not solved a whole lot

in the way of underage drink-

4 ing. The people with “NO”

 

stamps are not standing around
drinking soda, and the two or
three people who didn’t man-
age to get on any lists are
having an equally interesting
time at a rocking apartment
party in South Oakland, shar-
ing a bottle of Quervo and
waiting for the next big fight.

The only things the new rules
have been good for have been
the amusing scenarios I have
described above, and maybe a
surge of excitement at CMU. I
wonder what the stats are on
the number of girls harassed,
-robbed, etc. in a stupored tran-

sit between these two schools
at 3 a.m.

In the meantime, I’m kind of
enjoying watching the panic in
people's eyes while they look
through a list to find their
names. Their hands shake as
they think, “Gosh, . what if
Mindy forgot to tell Cindy to
remind Becky Sue, whose best
friend's boyfriend is a brother
at blah blah blah, to put me and
seven of my friends on the list
here?” '

My advice to those who have
somehow been omitted? Look
around casually as you make
like you're about to sign and
say to your seven friends, “You
know what? The party across
the street looked much more
exciting; do you guys want to
go ‘over there instead?” Then
wink real hard. if]

Non-revenue sports take steps for TV exposure

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Last Saturday’s volleyball match~wasn’t
just another match for the Lady Panthers;

, it began an important chapter for Pitt’s

non-revenue sports. The match was

‘ videotaped and will be the first event

  

broadcasted under the university’s new
two-year contract with Gianotti Television
(GTV) Sports. The contract will allow all
of Pitt’s non-revenue sports to be aired
on television. The volleyball match will
be broadcast this Saturday at 9:30 pm’. on
the KBL network.

The taping ran smoothly, according to

announcers Laurie Duncan, Jim Herbstritt A

and George Von Benko.

“These guys did a heck of a job. For

two people that didn’t know as much

about volleyball, they stepped right in

 

and did a good job,” said Duncan, a
volleyball expert from Penn State who
was broughtin as a color analyst for the
match.

“I thought it went well. It’s my first
experience with volleyball, and these
guys were a great help,” said Von Benko,
a former WTAE-AM , sports talk show
host. \

GTV president Dennis Gianotti said he

hopes to continue using Von Benko and
Herbstritt as permanent announcers for
all the events and then to bring in an
expert in the sport being broadcast to
provide color.
I Gianotti worked withAssociate Director
of Athletics Dean Billick and Women’s
Athletic Director Carol Sprague to iron
out the contract. . ‘

“It didn't take that long. We had a few

all had a common goal in mind: to put Pitt
sports on TV and do a good job of it,”
Gianotti said. 4

“I believe the level of amateur sports in
the city of Pittsburgh is high, but we need
to inform the public. We can’t expect the
public to go to the games if they don’t
knowabout them,” said Sprague.

Gianotti said he would like this

I weekend’s USAir Volleyball Classic to be

the next event to be broadcasted, but that
nothing is deﬁnite yet. ’
“We’ll be sitting down with the Athletic

approximately four events a month that
we’ll be doing; that's your goal,” said
Gianotti. “Some months we’ll have more,
some we’ll have less, depending on how

if the teams are doing, if they’re going

toward playoffs or something.”
“There’s a lot of sports out there, and

 

and mapping out

you've got good teams, and yet it was not
being exposed in Pittsburgh. I think tl -re
definitely is a market for it," Gianotti said.

GTV has also produced other sporting
events for television since its inception
two years ago.

“We have pool tournaments, we did
the United States Amateur’ Clay Court
[tennis] Championships, table tennis with
the Olympians, nine—ball [billiards]
tournaments, and we did a lot of boxing
for KBL,” Gianotti said. ‘

“But we’re also the No. 1 tele-realty

Saturday to defeat the Trojans,
28-24. T ony‘ Rice, who all of the
sudden is gaining recognition as

last—minute stand inside their own
20-yard line to secure the win. It
doesn't get any easier for the Irish
this week with Pitt invading South

mind-the Irish have been
playing just well enough to win

the scores against Michigan State

Newman. Jackson must also find
more time for scorer Kiki
Vandeweghe, who averaged 11
points in only 18 minutes per
game after being acquired from
Portland.

What makes the Philadelphia
76ers go? Charles Barkley. Sir
Charles had another banner year
in 1988-89, finishing 8th in scoring
(25.8 ppg) and 2nd in rebounding
(12.5). Barkley improves every
year and there’s no reason to
think this year will be any
different. The offoseason trade of
Maurice Cheeks leaves the Sixers

future, all events will be shown
on a tape-delay basis, but that
may change.

“We’ll hopefully do some live,
we're going to be choosing on
that. I can’t tell you which events
we'll be doing live, but we're
looking “forward to doing a few
live in the contract period,”
Gianotti said. .

Women’s volleyball head
coach Sue Woodstra was pleased
to have her team featured on the
first telecast.

“Except for the fact that we
lost, I thought it was good. It
was a good, competitive match.
The crowd was into it for the
entire match. Part of the reason
that G'I'V is doing this is to get
the [non-revenue] varsitysports
-out into the public so that people
can see that this is worth their
support too,” said Woodstra. “It’s
a really good opportunity for us;
I don’t think we can lose with it.
Even though we. lost the match,
I think it’s good exposure.” ‘

Pitt’s Michele Adarnson is also
looking forward to seeing herself
and her teammates on television.

“When I was in high school [in
Ontario], they televised a lot of
sports games. It was neat to.
have something to look back
onto, to keep as memorabilia.
This is going to be something
that I’ll deﬁnitely want to keep,”
said Adarnson.

Note  

Continued from page 7
They've managed only 29 goals
in the eight games, an average of
3.6 a game. Worse yet, the
Penguin power play, which
scored an NHL record 119 goals

last year, is ranked 17th in the 06

league and has converted just
one of its last 19 power play
chances. Not too much reason to
panic, though, with 72 games
remaining. One bright spot—the
play of goalies T om Barasso and
Wendell Young, who have played
spectacularly despite the offensive
drought.

°And ﬁnally, ESPN’s Dream
Season will end this Sunday night
with the Dream Bowl, pitting the
1978 Pittsburgh Steelers against
the 1972 undefeated Miami
Dolphins. The '78 Steelers reached
the Dream Bowl by beating the
1984 San Francisco 49ers, 20-17.
Miami beat the ’76 Oakland

with no true point guard. Look for their
league-low 14.8 turnovers a game to fatten
withjohnny Dawkins and Hersey Hawkins
(15.1 ppg) running the show. Mike Grninski
(17.2 ppg) and sixth-man Ron Anderson,
two of the NBA’s most underrated players,
will be keys to Philadelphia’s success.
Huge years from Barkley and Gminski
could put the Sixers in first.

The Washington Bullets came within
one game of making the playoffs last year,
but only because the Celtics were down.
The Bullets are basically a team of gunners,
which isn’t so bad if a couple hit 50% of
their shots. Not one Bullet hit 50%. Worse

yet, they have no player over 6’9", making

it difﬁcult to rebound Bernard King’s, John
Williams’ and Jeff Malone’s I bricks.
Rebounding is one area coach Wes Unseld
will need to shore up. No.1 draft pick Tom
Hammonds is a banger who will deﬁnitely
help. He’ll be given strong consideration
for Rookie-of-the-Year. Until the Bullets
get a big man, they’ll continue to hang out
at the basement of the Atlantic. Don’t be
surprised if Malone is traded to get one.

The Miami Heat ﬁfth? You bet. Now
don’t get too excited, they're still a long,
long way away. But, the Miami organization
is headed in the right direction. The drafting
ofMichigan’s Glenn Rice in the first round
will definitely help the league’s worst
offense. He’ll be good for 25 a game. And
along with Rony Seikaly, Grant Long and
Billy Thompson, the Heat have the makings
of an excellent frontline. General Sherman
Douglas should take over at point guard
before too long and last year’s leading
scorer Kevin Edwards (13.8 ppg) is a good
al1~around player. Give the Heat two more
years and they could be knocking on the
door of the Atlantic's upper echelon.

Bill Fitch inherits a New Jersey Nets
team with only two proven NBA players-
forwards Chris Morris and Roy Hinson.
The Nets dealt leading rebounder Buck
Williams for Sam Bowie and the pick that
brought point guard Mookie Blaylock.
Blaylock will start immediately, Bowie
may not. He has played only 28 games in
the past three years due to injuries. Dennis
Hopson shot only 41.9% from the ﬁeld in

     
     
         
   
     
     
  
    

’88-89, putrid for a shooting guard. If
Bowie can come back to play a large
portion of the year and Hopson can regain
the touch he possessed at Ohio State, the
Nets could challenge the Heat for ﬁfth.
Central Division ’

The defending champion Detroit
Pistons are again the class of the Central
Division. Chuck Daly’s “Bad Boys” have it
all. Their corps of guards-——Isiah Thomas,
playoff MVP Joe Dumars and Vinnie
“Microwave” Johnson——is one of the top
three in the NBA. Thomas only dished out
eight assists per game last year; with all the
scorers Detroit has, he should be taking
considerably less than the 1227 shots he
took in ’88-89. But willhe? Doubtful. Even
with the loss of the baddest boy of them
all, Rick Mahorn, the Pistons are still
awesome up front. Bill Laimbeer is a
versatile center who can play inside or
outside (that is, when he’s not crying to
the refs and throwing cheap shots). Dennis
Rodman, the consummate sixth-man,

‘ averaged nine points, 10 rebounds in only

24 minutes per game and was “Mr.
Inspiration” for the Pistons. Expect his
stats and playing time to increase. John
Salley (6’1 1"), James Edwards (7’1"), David
Greenwood (6’10") and possibly William
Bedford (7’0") provide humongous depth
off the bench.» The Pistons will be

unstoppable again.

Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls
continue to improve every year. First
rounders Stacey King, B.J. Armstrong and
Jeff Sanders will help immensely. Christmas
came six months early for the Bulls.
Armstrong should take over at point guard,
freeing Jordan to ﬂy anywhere he wants.
AirJordan’s stats last year——32.5 ppg, eight
assists, eight rebounds and selection to

‘the NBA’s all—defensive team. He should

have been MVP. He will be this year. The
Bulls’ only concern is the'pivot where Bill
Cartwright could muster only 12 points a

I game. But, scoring isn’tmuch of a concern

with Jordan around.

V The Cleveland Cavaliers have one of
the best starting units in the NBA, but
injuries to two of these players will seriously
hurt. Brad Daugherty is out until mid-
December, Larry Nance until January.

Without those two, the frontline is
practically bare. Phil Hubbard was released,
leaving “Hot Rod” Williams, Tree Rollins,
Randolph Keys and Chris Dudley manning
the frontcourt. Not too scary. The play of
Williams, Mark Price (18.9 ppg) and Ron
Harper (18.6 ppg) should keep the Cavs
close until Daugherty (18.9 ppg) and Nance
(17.2 ppg) return. When they do, look out.
Craig Ehlo andJohn Morton provide solid
guard depth. If Daugherty and Nance
come back and stay healthy, the Cavs,
with the 3rd-best defense in the league last
year, could catch Chicago and possibly
Detroit Don’t count on it.

Never known. as the most exciting
team in the NBA, the Milwaukee Bucks
are certainly one of the steadiest. The
Bucks proved in the 1989 playoffs that
they could win without Terry Cummings;
he was traded to San Antonio and won't
be missed. In fact, acquiring GregAnderson
and Alvin Robertson for Cummings was a
better trade for the Bucks. The Bucks
(with Anderson, veteran Jack Sikma and

, Larry Krystkowiak) are thin up front and

deep (with Robertson, Jay Humphries,
Paul Pressey and Ricky Pierce) at guard.
Pressey, Robertson or Pierce (17.6 ppg,
22.3 in the playoffs) could move to small
forward, the likely choice being Pressey
playing his accustomed “point forward"
position. Without Cummings, the Bucks
will be even more balanced scoring-wise
than last year. Factor in a defense that
surrendered the sixth-fewest points in the
NBA and you have a team that could
surprise. 8

Why aren’t the Atlanta Hawks among
the league’s elite? They have one of the
deepest squads in the NBA andare one of
the few teams that play well at both ends
of the court (offense-7th, defense-9th).

I One reason may be Dominique Wilkins.

The Human Highlight Film ﬁred 1756
shots lastayear, 700 more than any other
Hawk. Wilkins has been playing long
enough to realize that he’s not a great
shooter and should be relying on his
plethora of inside moves and dunks for
much of his offense. All-star Moses Malone

can still_ do it, averaging 20.2 points on
only 13 shots a game. Antoine Carr, Keith
Willis, Jon Koncak and Cliff Levingston

give Atlanta a formidable frontline. The I

Hawks’ weakness is at guard. Doc Rivers,
who dipped from 9.6 assists in 1987-88 to
6.9 last year, is the team’s only solid guard.
Shooting guard John Battle must improve
his terrible 45% from the ﬁeld and Spud
Webb is vastly overrated. No. 1 pick Roy
Marbleshould help considerably.

The Indiana Pacers are one talented
team. Chuck Person (21.6 ppg), Reggie
Miller, Vern Fleming, Detlef Schrempf and
Rik Smits make a respectable first five.
Add in LaSalle Thompson, Mike Sanders,
Randy Wittman and No. 1 pick George
McCloud and you have a pretty solid team.
So, why don’t they win? Too much offense,
not enough “D”. Person, Fleming and
Miller are ball hogs and, with McCloud
coming in, there may not be enough balls

to go around. Smits (foul every 6.6 minutes), I

Person, Miller and Fleming are all defensive
liabilities and, with these four aspstarters,
opposing point totals could be
astronomical. One thing is for sure-—the
Pacers will be bad looking good with new

Welcome to the NBA, Orlando Magic!
Get ready to have your block knocked off.
All expansion teams must start somewhere
and at least this team looks_better than
Minnesota’s. ‘Forwards Terry Catledge,

Sidney Green and draft picks Nick
Anderson and Michael Ansley are b()ard
bangers with no scoring touch outside 10
feet. Their rebounding will more than
compensate for Dave Corzine’s presence
at center. The forwards’ lack of scoring
touch may not hurt too much, what with
the surprising guard talent the Magic picked
up in the expansion draft. Reggie Theus
(15.8 ppg.) is the perfect expansion team
player being a selﬁsh scorer. He’1l score
20+ per game, probably taking 20 shots in
the process. Sam Vincent, Scott Skiles and
Otis Smith give Orlando three offensively-
capable guards. But, it won’t help much as
the Magic are still three, four years away.
