Frat Probation   Rescindecl 

After Meloro A,boot—Face.~s"

BY TOM SMITH

The controversial probation a-
gainst the Delta Sigma Chi
fraternity imposed by Director of
Student'Activities Dan Meloro for
violation of University policy has
been rescinded. The probation was
slapped on the fraternity because
‘alcoholic beverages were served at
Delta Sigma Chi's open party
during Orientation, against orien-
tation regulation. ‘

Delta Sigma Chi had been
prohibited from participation in any
intramural activities, participation
as a member of IFC and all the
related privileges, application by
individual chapter members for an
IFC emergency loan fund, partici-
pation in any campus program,
sponsorship of any event,_ program,
or individual, extension of bids to
new members, and initiation of
new members. . .

decision Meloro reduced by one the

the program questioned the logic of
Pitt's commitment being a -great

second'or third rate urban studies
program. i _
Now, however, [the program is

moxfing in'what Hays calls “the

right direction.” ‘

“We’ve got a- new thing going,”
Hays said. “At the least we’ve got
a program that’s starting that’s a
little better than before. But I hope
it doesn’t stop here.”

“We're adding upperclass inte-

Provost Rhoten Smith, in an-
nouncing the appointment said, “I
"feel confident that with his

background and ability, Dr. Wer-‘

ner will effectively serve the school
and the University during this

interim period.”

Werner, who received his degree
in his native Austria, was formerly
on the faculties of John‘ Hopkins
University Medical School and
Cornell University Medical Col-

lege. He came to Pitt in 1965.
Before coming to the United
States in 1957. Werner held

academic appointments’ at the
University of Sao Paulo. University
of Calcutta and the University of
Vienna. He also held a World
Health Organization Fellowship at
University College, London.

Werner has pioneered research on
electrical impulses of the brain and
the information processing of the
nervous system. He has been very
active ‘in academic affairs in the

'school, reevaluziting the under-

graduate medical curriculum, in-
troducing innovative educational
techniques and updating‘ curricu-
lum structure. " Werner will
continue to chair the department of
ph_armacology._ ..

  

  

A search committee to fill the
deanship on a permanent basis is
being assembled in‘ cooperation
with faculty of the School of

With the season opener at Florida
State just a week away, head
football coach Johnny Majors has

not been satisfied with the progress "

made by the Panthers. Poor
weather shortened camp at Johns-
town by two days, sending the Cats
home for a dry surface to set their
timing. Majors feels, however, all
isnot lost and that there are some
bright spots to go along with the
bad, like the chances of a national
championship IF Pit would go
a national championship. IF Pitt
would go undefeated.

Always starkly realistic,_ even to
the point of sounding alarmingly
pessimistic, Majors gives a preview
of what he has seen of the 1974 Pitt
Panthers in an in-depth interview
on page 32.

“Our schedule is tough,” the
Major notes, “but I’m not about to
sit back to cry and moan about. It’s
ours and we’ll have to make the

Milani elaborated upon the
services this auditorium--“one of
our priorities”--would provide.
“Being a building in its own right,
the auditorium would be designed
to complement present facilities «in

offer additional services, perhaps a
music listening center, or a
mini-spa with exercise equip-
ment," Milani said, “and there
will probably be more than enough
room to go around”,

Milani emphasized the need for a
conference room, “a real one. with
full-fledged equipment. Such a
room would of course be. open to all
University organizations.”

The proposed face-lifting of
Schenley Hall includes the re-
modeling of the present recreation
The standard pool, ping
pong, pinball, and air hockey will
be supplemented by a few

experimental facilities such as
bowling.
Milani cited the need for a

year-round art gallery to occupy the
present communications center.

“The focal point could be, for
instance, changing
student crafts. And art seminars
would also figure prominently.”

The ice cream shop, closed at the
enﬂ of winter term due to lack of
interest, will be revived if
supported through student patron-
ization. “You have to realize that
this is a convenience, it can't
operation on a gratis basis--it has to
be financially successful on its
own,” Milani said.

Opening the first week of
September, the shop “is designed
to tide students over until a more
substantial food service program
can be developed," Milani ex-
plained. “The ice cream shop, due
to its nature, will have . limited
facilities and was not created to
compete with'the outside estab-
lishments,” Milani said. “We’re
not here to subsidize the student in
reference to his food needs but we
are here to service students.”

He disclosed plans for “Uncle
Charlie’s Pizza Shop, the ice cream
shop eventual replacement.
Milani added, “Live entertainment
will be provided in the form of
honky-tonk pianos and sing-alongs,

exhibits of -

‘state funding body) doesn’t fund

as well as coffeehouse perform-
ers.” He emphasized what he
termed the “atmosphere of the
place, i.e., it will provide more than
a popular menu and speedy
service."

Plans allowing a 200 person
seating capacity with room for
expansion also mean complete
remodeling of the proposed site,
the Hunt Room. Now closed, the
room will tentatively reopen as
“Uncle Charlie’s” November 1.

Milani admitted the possibility of
a snack-bar type operation to
complement the pizza shop, and
another ice-cream shop is not
entirely out of the question. But he
added, “We”ll get into that later.
All food services run on yearly
contracts until student response
can be evaluated.”

Other renovations under consid-
eration include what Milani terms
the “presently inadequate” infor-
mation center in the Student
Union. “The Student Union now
carries the bulk of the responsibi-
lity for the dissemination of all
University information. We hope
to upgrade the‘ services and
generate a better level of informa-
tion collection and distribution; but
to do so will require more than
reconstruction. We need more
personnel and financial support,
too.”

planning a concept that encom-
passes phases one and two. When
the two are completed, the complex
will be a University Services Health
Center, not a Student Union type of
thing. This term is the one we used
in our request for state funds. It
doesn’t reﬂect so much a name
change as a change in services.
“We’re at the stage now where ,

we can speak intelligently in‘
layman’s terms about the type of
balconies and sound systems we’d
like. We hope to be ready to go to
the architects by the end of the
winter term. The longer we
wait, you know, the worse off we'll
be. Material and labor costs will of
course have increased by that time,
so we want to be ready as soon as
possible. We've got plenty of
ideas, we just need money.”

fage  PITT NEWS—Monday, September 9, 1974

‘VA summer has come and gone and the question of funding for the Pitt
gHockey Club remains unresolved. ' _

1-’ A After denying the club funds last March and committing itslef to seek
 ﬁnancing from the Athletic Department, Student Government
 representatives made only half-hearted token effort, if that, to obtain
3 the necessary operating funds.

 -Yet, the Student Govemment Board cannot beheld completely
"responsible for this failure. With the cooperation of Athletic Director
‘ Casmire Myslinski the effort was doomed from the beginning. ,
5 Myslinski’s adamant refusal to consider the question of ﬁmding the
Hockey ..

Faculty representatives, speciﬁcally Dr. Harry J. Werner, chairman
xof the University Senate Committee on Athletics displayed only
[ intolerance when confronted with the opportunity to maintain an open
V. channel of communication with students. The committee failed in

_other alternative but togrant funds necessary for the operation of a

‘question the activities of the Pitt Hockey Club.

 , Yet, it carmot be forgotten that the initial decision by the Board last
_ winter was the proper one. Funding of the Hockey Club by the Atheltic
Deparment would have been an asset to Pitt by guaranteeing the
’_ hockey team the maximum support possible under the wing of the
A Athletic Department and not. only the minimal support affordable by
j’ }Student Government.

  In the last ﬁve months of the current temis of our SG representatives

Saving Children

Anti-Abortion: Insuring» Life

BY MARY LOUMAHON

"Would you buy cable TV from
that's man?" That's the question
anyone concerned about the
intrinsic value of human life must
answer about Governor Milton
Shapp.

This is the politician who in
October, 1970, stated, “I welcome
this opportunity to set the record
straight on this issue. I am against
abortion. My commitment per-
sonally and as governor is and will
be . to the preservation and
protection ‘of all life, and children
not yet born are fully entitled to the
full’ protection of the state. We
need a sound, unequivocal law in
Pennsylvania to insure this protec-
tion.”

This is the politician who in -1972
vetoed House Bill (HB) 800 which
would have fulfilled his “commit-
ment" and this is the politician who
in July of 1974 vetoed the Abortion
Control Act, Senate Bill (SB) 1318,
which wuld have extended the
“protection ofthe state" to at least
some of this state's “Children not
yet born."

This same politician, in his veto
message, claims to have always
been in favor of the strict
regulation of the abortion proce-
dure and has yet to offer one
solution that amounts to anything

other than a license for abortion one

dcmand. Two politically orche-
strated eleventh hour vetoes and a
rigged Women's Abortion Law
Commission make hollow. indeed,
his words of 1970.

Both houses of the General
Assembly passed the Abortion
Control Act by overwhelming
The governor claimed
that the legislation “flew in the
face of the Supreme Court ruling”
because it required the consent of a
spouse or parent, in the case of a
minor,_before the abortion proce-
dure could be undertaken.

One, of the fundamental inade-
quacies of that January, 1973
ruling is the fact that the.court
never dealt with the rights of
fathers, despite the fact it was
pointed out to them no woman has
ever been known to become
pregnant of or by herself.

People Concerned for the Unborn
Child have never viewed SB 1318
as a satisfactory response to the
horrendous ruling of the US
Supreme Court. We have never
accepted it as anything other than
interim legislation that would
preserve some lives until the time
when a Human Life Amendment to
the US Constitution is adopted.
There were, however. some very
important aspects of the measure
that should now be in effect.

The bill would have required any
woman seeking an abortin to certify

she was doing so with her own
“informed consent.” She would be
required to state she had been
advised there may be detrimental
physical and ‘psychological effects
resulting from the abortion. There

is abundant documentation that

those risks are very real and very
substantial.

She would have to be advised.
hopefully. without preiudice, that
there are alternatives to abortion,
including childbirth and adoption.

A father would have been given a
voice in determining the life or
death of his unborn child, and
parents would have had the
opportunity to shield a child still
legally under their protection from
the physical and psychological
trauma an abortion may produce.

In addition, no court, judge,
executive officer, administrative
agency or public employee of the
Commonwealth, could require any
person to have or not to have an
abortion.

Of monumental importance is the
fact that SB 1318 would have
protected the lives of children who

had the audacity to survive an‘

abortion. No longer would they be
left to die from neglect or by direct
action on the part/of the abortion
team.

A premature infant aborted alive
could not be used for any kind of
experimentation except as neces-

~ sary to protect or preserve the life

and health of the infant. Every
medical skill would have to be
employed to preserve the life of a
viable fetus. and no abortion could
be performed after viability had
been established except to pre-
serve the life or health of the
mother.

The Abortion‘ Control Act would
have put an end to the advertising
“peddling” of abortion services
and eliminated the kick-backs to

_ referral agencies.

ln June the Governor of Ohio,
John Gilligan. signed into law a bill
very similar to SB 1318. Unlike
Gm'crr.e:' Shag:-p. he did. not set it
as his function to determine the
constitutionality of the legislation.
Apparently Gilligan realized that
function should be left to the
courts.

it is interesting to note_that when
a state income tax law was-
pi‘r:s.<'-m<:<_‘.- to Governor Sh;-.pp,
which was to his liking. he signed it
despite the fact that he was told it
was probably unconstitutional
which in fact it was.

The Governor recentlysigned the

No-Fault lnsurance Bill, yet his

Attorney General announced that
its constitutionality would most
likely be challenged.

It is to the everlasting glory of this V

Commonwealth that leadershiop

. determined

such as Governof Shapp‘s was not
apparent when Pennsylvania was
in the forefront of the abolitionist
movement. In 1857, the US
Supreme Court handed down the
infamous Dred Scott decision in_
which it declared the black slave a
“non-person" to be disposed of at
will of his owner.

The citizens of this state were‘n_ot
willing to accept this_as “the law of
the land" and, although it took
more tl‘...-°u': one hut.-ched years -to
undo that injustice, they worked

hard for the constitutional alilend-7?,»--*"

ment to accomplish that.

Pro-life people likewise refuseto ' M
accept as “the law of the land” the 

court‘s 2973 decision that the

_unborn child is a “non-person”

and we look to the leadership of the a
General Assembly to help undo
that injustice. -

It is not a matter of “imposing
morality" on society. We view it as-
a civil rights issue to the. same
degree that the abolitionists viewed
the Dred Scott decision. No human
being. born or unborn, can be
denied the right to life without due

process of law. It is as simple as i

that.

If a human being is defined as
anything other than the new being
who results from. the union of
human ovum and ‘human sperm, if
any conditions are attached as
criterion for the human’s right to
life, then no born human's right to
life is guaranteed.

The fact that the Governor has

turned a‘ deaf ear to the will of the

people should not deter the
legislature from heeding it at their
first opportunity.

Last year. in Pittsburgh, two out_ -

of three pregnancies ‘ended in
abortion. The fact that more
unborn childrendied in the city of
Pittsburgh than were born can only
bring shame to a city that claims‘ to
be “someplace special." It should i
be noted that not all those

abortions were performed on raped  
Y

13-year olds. ‘

The late President John F.
Kennedy said. “Children arepour.
greatest natural resource.” The.
inalienable right to life for the
smallest members of the human
family who are unabletospeak for
themselves, unborn children must
be insured. SB 1318 is one step
along the way and we look forward
to its implementation. We are
to fulfill C-i,.vernor
Shapp‘:: 1970 pro-life ‘-‘commit-
ment" even-if he is no longer

' willing.

Drinking Age

 

m

BY JESS BRALLIER

It takes but a short amount of time
and basic common sense before
one realizes the many drawbacks of
attending Pitt.
Besides the fact that the majority of
fellow Pitt students lack any mental
. process capable of elementary
reasoning — proof being that few
have yet to discover that non-func-
tioning mind is best exposed
through extremely loud and con-
sistant use of the mouth — there is
__ the frustrating problem in Pitts-
iiburgh being located in Pennsyl-
vania.
‘For those of you with gray hair, or
no hair, or false ID cards who
therefore might be ignorant of the
situation, the problem with Penn-
sylvania life is that one must be 21
years of age to drink alcholic
beverages.
I Thisilaw is not only stupid, but
illogical, inconsistent in thought,
and insulting to even the very least
responsible of individuals. The
idea of legally denying a beer to the
eighteen year old responsible

Editor: -

On September 11th a demonstra-
tion will be held in Pittsburgh on
the first anniversay of the bloody
coup d’etat that rocked the country
of Chile. This demonstration is not
intended to “commemorate" that
day but rather it serves as a means
to display to our government and th
citizens of the United States our
concern over the continued brutal

‘ repression of the Chilean people.

The indiscriminate terror has

stopped, due primarily to intema- '

. tional protest, but there still
T‘-. remains a situation of terror much
akin to that found in Brazil. The
United States Government has
recognized the four man military
- junta as the legal government of
\ Chile despite mass protest by the
American people. Huge amounts
of econmic and military aid have -
been channeled into Chile to aid
the junta in carrying out its
murderous acts of repression.

those who once denied females the
right to vote.

For the government, through it's
military branches, to give an
eighteen year old the responsibility
to kill foreigners and even pay him.
then not permit him to have a beer
is so idiotic as to make the thought
somewhat impossible to grasp.

To grant the right. of creating life
through legal marriage to eighteen
year olds but not their right to
appropriately celebrate such a
happening is at the best, a total

».lack of reasoning.

Then to legally permit a situation
where parents can form the basic
mental structure and morals of a
child for as long as three years and
at the same moment insist that
those parents are not mature or
responsible enough to have a beer
is again typical of the traditional
non-thinking abilities of the aver-
age lawmaker.

representative of the average. for
proper drinking age proposals have
been voted down several times by
the majority of this state‘s congress
in the past few years.
if one recalls, the basic argument
against lower age proposals was
that hundreds of drunken 18, 19
and 20 year olds would be riding
around killing people. The
statistics from other states which
have lowered their drinking age
proves this to be true. But let’s
take a look at those statistics.
First. for all those deaths arising
from the dead driver himself being
drunk. lt takes a tremendous lack
of fundamenal thinking and disres-
pect of human life to drive, if
drunk, further than the length of a
driveway. i
So what have we lost by such a
fool‘s death beside possible, a nice
car and an expensive telephone
pole. In fact, if this is the
immediate result of ‘lowering a
state‘s drinking age, such a new
law could be the most beneficial
legislation yet, that is, the
self-elimination of a few morons.
This is but a small part of the
problem, [though,] because of the
much more tragic deaths of
innocent riders, sober drivers and
pedestrians.

a 21 drinking age also permit a

reported during tliisiiitcrval were
common thefts. There was not a
single incident of murder or rape.
Graham said. '

“Just because we're a college

doesn't exclude us from harder
crimes just like the rest of the
city," Graham said. “I suppose
we were just lucky this summer."

Unlike previous summers, the
bulk of thefts were not restricted to
off campus areas. “As a matter of
fact. the majority were committed
right inside university buildings.
Scaife Hall. the Towers, Trees
Hall. and the Cathedral were the
worst areas." he said.

Asked if students were respon-
sible for many of these crimes,

attributing much of the crime in
Oakland to outsiders. “People who
don't even live around here come in
to steal bikes, sell hot stereos, or

‘just to cause trouble," Officer Tony

Glowczewski pointed out. “Right
now is when they'll make their

Graham had several suggestions

prevent the rise in crime which
typically accompanies the begin-

among these he said was the plea
to use common sense.

pp Dorm Refugees Lod

BY CAL RITCHEY

About 50 would-be resident
students are being temporarily
housed in the Hotel Webster Hall
as a result of an overﬂow of
students applying for on-campus

, housing this year, according to Pitt
Assistant Housing Director Gerald
Dalton.

The students, mostly male, are
the exces from some 3,800 students
currently using campus ‘housing.
Most of the students involved in
the relocation to Webster were
notiﬁed of the change before
arriving on campus, Dalton said.

{Tlrere is no extra cost to the
students, he added.

_,_Mich_ael Jones, a New York City
sophomore majoring in sociology,
is one of the affected students.

“The disadvantage is that we
have to walk from Webster to the
Towers cafeteria in order to eat our

meals,” Jones said. “As far as the‘

room itself goes, I can’t complain. ’ ’
“As temporary housing it’s OK,’’
said freshman Mizell Henderson of

According to Dalton and Campus

“The purpose is not. ‘in service
training’ at all. It’ll be meant to
open up a student’s mind as to
what a city is about and how its
problems can be worked out.“
Hays said the Urban Studies
program is not just a lead-in to
career ‘work in urban problems.
“It’s more of a liberal arts setup,”
. he said. “It’s not pre-professional.
It’s mainly meant to open up
students minds to the problems
that exist. Then they can take it

from there.” Some of the new
personnel for the ‘program include
Dr. Walter S. Glazer of the history

said. Ventur’s office will be the

vacancies in the regular dorms
occur, the overﬂow students will be
moved back to the dormitory
spaces. The dorms have been ﬂlled
since last May, when the Housing
Ofﬂce quit accepting students for
campus housing, he added. ,

Albert and Dalton said the last
two years have seen students
housed in Webster, mainly a result
of lack of off-campus housing, and
the elimination of “mandatory
board” policies. Albert said the
mandatory board policy required
upper-classmen who requested
dormitory space to pay for meals in
the campus cafeteria.
was recently dropped, with the
result that more ‘upper-classmen
are seeking rooms-on-campus, he
said. ,

The students at Webster Hall are

housed on at least three different
floors, and “are no problem at all,”
according to John Makary, Execu-
tive Assistant Manager of the
Webster Hall Hotel. “I think some
of them are spoiled when they have
to move back to the dorms,”
Makary said. “Here they have
private baths and so on—I
understand it's a different kind of
living from the dorms.”

In addition to the Webster Hall
residents, Carlow College, located
on Fifth Avenue, houses some Pitt
student, according to one of these
residents, Jill Rush. Jill, who is a
transfer student from Edinboro
State Teachers College, said she
transfered too late to get dormitory
space. Other students at Carlow,
she reported, are largely graduate
students or transfers like herself.
The students at Carlow live on the

Profile

BY FELICE NEWMAN

Cynthia Vanda kicks off her shoes
and curls up in a couch corner,
facing a fisted women‘s symbol
hangingon the wall.

The new Women‘s Center director
alternated between intently follow-
ing the eyes of a speaker,
information process clicking. and
leading the discussion with her own
decisive speech. She spoke of

\..-soliciting ideas and suggestions,
F;-tI‘essliing the need for a balance

between activism and discussion.

The Center, which is located in
Bruce Hall, is a vehicle for social
action for furthering feminist goals
such as equal education and
employment opportunities and
child care services available to all
University parents.

Besides being an impetus for
activism, it is a vehicle for ‘fmoral,
emotional, ideological and psycho-
logical support" for women.

The five room center includes a.

lounge for comfort and a congrega-
tion area available to all University
Consciousness-raising

informal instruction in self-defense
and female physiology are offered.

Vanda, parent of two children and
wifeiofa student, is a graduate of
Chatham College and Pitt's GSPIA.
She is the first director of the
center. even though the center has
existed for nearly half a year. The

        

University just didn‘t allocate
funds for a salaried administrator
before this time.

Affirmative action, the Univer-
sity’s program for ending job
dicrimination, is a priority of the
center. “It needs not to be just X
number of jobs, but women and
minorities in decision making
positions," said Vanda, “The
whole system of institutional
racism and sexism needs to be
approached and dealt with."-
Vanda stressed the‘ importance of
improving attitudes within the
University on issues concerning
sexism. She cited two routes to be
followed in dealing with institu-

-tionally -based and perpetuated
‘sexism and

racism—first, to
identify instances of sexism in the
classroom, and second, to get the
University to hire non-s_exist and
non-racist faculty and staff.

Vanda has a history of feminist
activities, beginning when she
worked with the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA) on Project Nigeria three
years ago.

Susanna Downing, a co-worker at
the Women‘s Center, said, “She
got involved with the problems of
women staff, most of them black.
The women were unusually con-
scious—of feminism—and Cynthia
helped them organize. They
became the GSPIA Task Force."

Vanda‘s activities made ’trouble

3*/ondct Strikes o Bolonce for Activism, DisCUssion 

for her a GSPIA, but knowing
Project Nigeria would soon end and
she‘d be moving on, she continued
her activities. From GSPIA she
moved to the Graduate School of
Business where she was an
assistant to the dean. There,
according to Downing, her boss
told Vanda to limit her extra cirric-
cular activities—meaning her fem-
inist activities. ’ *

“Cynthia said, well, she‘d try, to
play it cool," Downing said,
explaining that while Vanda
worked for the dean of the Business
School her feminist activities
consumed the same amount of time
and-energy as ever, but Vanda
“just kept her activities in the
closet. She wanted to get out of her
jo and didn‘t want bad vibes."

Throughout this, Downing insist-
ed, “She won‘t do anything that
looks militant. She might if it were
extreme enough. But she‘ll look
for another way to deal with the
situation, and there usually is
another way. She‘ll choose the way
that will make the least waves.”
While Vanda is “open on "all
women‘s issues.” ' ~

Downing said it is her keen sense
of the orthodox bureaucracy and
administrative efficiency, more
than her knowledge of, feminist
theory, that won her the, job of’
Women‘s Center director.

  Anthro Teom Strikes Jackpot

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Archeologists dig up bones,
right? Not even new bones, they
just like the old ones right?_ ,

Actually, archeologists seem to be

’a breed of patient time traveler,

and the excavation team here at
Pitt zomed back to 13,000 BC
recently without the aid of Tom

V Swift or nuclear energy.

A crew of student archeologists
working with Dr. James Adovasio,
consultants from the University's
faculty and the Smithsonian Insti-

' tute made their journey with picks,

handle-less shovels and sharpened
trowels.

They have just begun the
incredible labor of cataloging,
classifying and measuring thou-
sands of bones and stone artifacts
recovered in the course of the

summer’s excavation.

The work was done at the
now-famous Avella excavation site
in Washington County, about 36
miles from Pittsburgh.

The uproar began when local
amateur archeologist and history
buff Albert Miller uncovered
mussel shells and ﬂints after
poking a groundhog hold near a
rock overhang on his property.

Adovasio, who worked for the
Smithsonian Institute and did
extensive rock-shelter studies in
the West, had been looking for a
similar site in the Eastern United
States, although many experts
considered this area an archeolo-
gical desert.

After digging through the more
recent refuse of hunters, drug

freaks and beer addicts, the work
crew uncovered woven baskets and

stone utensils which promised even
more historical finds tocome.

As it turned out, the site had been
utilized continously for a long, long
»time, with early bands of American
Indians using the rock shelter as
a hunting camp as far back as
13,000 ,BC.,

The men who used the shelter at
that date had an advanced polar
climate technology similar to North
American Eskimos. The edge of
the massive North American
Glacier was just a spear-chuck
away in Butler Couty near'Moraine
State Park. .

According to exhibits in the
Carnegie Museum, these ancestors
hunted the likes of wooly mam-
moths and sabre-tooth tigers, with
a loose social relationship common
to hunter-gather tribes.

“There was no one in charge, just
people of influence’ who would
suggest a course of action. There
certainly. was a sophisticated
religon of a ritualistic nature,”
Adovasio said.

Many eras in tribal development
can be traced at_the Avella site.
Carbon-dating studies by the
Smithsonian have pinpointed the
age‘ of articles from the various
strata. As a result the Avella
Excavation will be the best
documented site ever in North
American History.

One of the immediate results of
the discovery of artifacts dating
13,000 BC is anthropologists will

- have to push back the previously

estimated times of migration of
Asiatic peoples across the Bering
Strait. .

“This is about the only extant rockw

shelter of it’s kind in Pennsyl-
vania,” Adovasio said. ‘‘It’s a
natural site because it’s deep

enough to be dry inside all year
round, and it faces south so
east-west winds provide ventilation
for fires.”

The actual excavation took hours
of labor, sometimes with shovels
without handles to clear away
caked clay outside the drip-line, the
point where rain water fell from the
lip of the shelter.

Working the softer,‘ dryer earth
within the shelter, students and
faculty used sharpened trowels and
brushes in their search.

Although the staff lived on-site
one summer and commuted from
Pittsburgh more recently, two
people were always on hand to
guard the works. Al Miller
provided a trailer and a roof-
construction over the dig to aid in
protection of the works.

Pitt’s anthropology department
has also done work in Mexico and
Cyprus in recent years in studies or
settlement patterns, although ac-
cording to Adovasio, “We probably
won’t go back to Cyprus soon
because of the trouble there.”

Senior graduate student David
Clark who. worked at the site
described the actual excavation as
“very tedious.” .

“We were working 10 to 12 hours
every -day. The clay outside the
d_ripline was pretty compact, and
because we knew it was an
important dig we went very
slowly.”

The student-faculty team moved
some 300 tons of dirt by hand in the
course of the dig, every ounce of

-which was sifted and washed to

rescue artifacts and loose particles.
Even pollen granules are procured
for test by botanists. “From the
pollen.‘ we can tell what, kind of

plants were prevalent, what the

climate was like and even wha 

they dragged into the shelter  ..._.,¥

eat. Pollen is. practically inde-
structable,” said Adovasio.

The hundreds of bags of artifacts
and bone shards accumulated 1.*om

the dig are to be examined by_

‘anthropology students in the

coming school year. The‘ bits and
pieces will go into the University
collection for the beneﬁt of future
studies. ’
Adovasio, who has raced motor-
cycles out West, remains inter-
ested in post-Ice Age tribal man,
even though the glory has always

followed the pyramid-explorers and_ ,

tomb-miners of archeology.

Adovasio stated he preferred this/"‘*

study of prehistoric man to studies
of more famous cultures in Egypt
and the Middle East. “I‘m not
interested in civilization,” he said.

an example of ‘classroom sexism.
Boyle argued rape can be seen as

_ in a case of classroom sexism, the

to Boyle, “The administration
hasn’t demonstrated a positive
stance” in day-to-day’ relations

 pt While it is often difficult to
ascertain the reasoning behind
policy-inak"ing of a sociological
nature, the inability of faculty
members to support gay students
in their struggles is an economic
problem. and therefore more easily
pinpointed.

Greenwald feels that even with
the tenuous position of faculty and
the lack of administrative support
gay students can cope with their
situation through consciousness-
raising and the Gay Liberation
Movement. “If it is a discussion of

question of the time and effort of
individuals within the Movement.”

One area‘ in which Pitt's ’gay
niovement has been successful is

the cstablishnient of a course
probing the gay experience.
During fall term I973. the W0-

men's Sttidies Program offered a
course called "Uay l.iberatioii.
Marcusian Analysis and the Meta-
morphosis into Ainbi-sexuality-
Human Sensuality: A Study in
Social Movements" with funding
through the College of Arts and
‘Sciences. Bob Hughes, a sociology
graduate student and undergra-
dtiate Diane Sutter. taught the
cotirse which drew some 25 stu-
dents plus a handful of steady
atiditors. The course will be
offered next semester again with
CAS funding. Hugcs, now teach-
ing with Debbie Boyle. expects 30
to 40 students this time. “halfgay,
half straight and a few in be-
tween." A

l his year's course will explore sex
stei'eot_vpiiig. gender identity, the
relation between the feminist
movement and the Gay Liberation
Movement and will discuss de-
leiises against rape and dealing
with racist society. among other
topics. \

Hughes felt the course really
belonged in the sociology depart-
niciit, comparing it to “The History
of the Role of Women," taught by
Greenwald in the history depart-

ment and cross-listed under Wo- p

meii‘s Studies. The original intent
had been to teach the course within
the sociology department, but as
Hughes explained, “None of the

professors were willing to sere as .

advisor or mentor in this particular
area. Many just weren‘t know-
ledgeablc. It is only recently that it
is being recognized as a social
movement."

While Hughes was unable to
speculate about the future of the
course he is teaching, he did say
there should also be psychology,
sociology, English and history

 

courses, all dealing with the central
theme of human sexualities.

Boyle compared UCLA's six cour-
ses on (jay Liberation to Pitt's one,
concluding that the figure signifies
that "their administration recogni-
/.cs the social issue and creates a
better climate for students."

While faculty and undergraduates
all lace the same psychological and
social pressures. the economic
insecurity expressed by faculty
members adds yet another dimen-
sion to the gay experience.
“Should you tell people? Should
you be open and hope they don't
cai'c'."' asks Linda l’ritchai‘d, a
graduate student and teaching
assistant in Pitt's history depart-
nicnt.

lhcre seems to be no answer.
lliere is always a paradox. One

-can be boxed into the closet,
comforted in the avoidance of job
discriniiiiation, and torn by the
need to lead a double life. Or one
can be quite honest and suffer the
consequences. The consensus
niarked the dilemma of every gay
person employed by the University.

“Our status as grad students are
positions in any case,” Pritehard
said. “We don t have access to our
letters of evaluation. We don't
know l-l that kind of iiifoi'm'.ttioii is
being passed on. But work of
inotitli can be equally devastating.

"It's so tindercovcr. No one has

ever said. 'l‘in gay.’ 01‘ made it
known publicly and then applied
tor a teaching assistantship. It's
hard to get at any overt or covert
tliscriinination. l’ve ‘had no trou-
blc. Now l'ni very open about it.
lve never told the people on my
committee but they’ll find out. My
firm belief is that there are instan-
ccs of discriniination against ho-
nioscxuality." _ l

 

L-recnwald was very adamant,
stating, "Any department that
takes into account whether some-
one is gay or not for hiring, or for
reappointment or firing is totally
off base. It is not a valid criterion
for deciding whether someone is a
decent teacher, scholar or decent
human being.”

Une history professor felt that
LAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
wouldn't turn down an appoint-
nieiit or tenure decision simply

because the person was gay. or‘

even because the person was
female.
Whether or not there really is a

policy ofdiscrimiiiatioii against gay

University employees may well be ‘
a debatable issue--until one listens

to the frustrations of its victims.
"My gay friends in the University
separate their public and personal
lives because they are scared to
death." said Pritehard. .
But the tables do turn. Sexuality
may be an unfounded basis for
measuring one’s capacity as a
teacher, but sexist attitudes can
prejudice the‘ role of a teacher. “If
someone is a sexist in the
classroom, explicitly abusive to the
female population, or racist,
explicitly abusive to blacks, or
well...we don’t have a word for
someone who is anti-gay, but for
someone of that sort who is
abusive, who make cracks and
innuendoes to the ' gay students,
that is inappropriate. That
behavior should be investigated
through grieviance procedures
within the University and should be
considered in evaluating some-
one’s career. Whether I’m gay or
not doesn’t matter,
treatment of others does because

GSP Discusses Gay ‘Politics

BY FELICE NEWMAN

Conversation drifts into the
Student Union hallway from a small
office. Inside, members of Gay
Students at ‘Pitt (GSP) discuss
issues vital to campus gays.

Last year the two-year-old organi-
zation numbered in the 20s,
serving multiple functions, provid-
ing social contact for gays, peer
consciousness-raising and public-
izing the needs of gay students
were the immediate goals. But the
group also saw themselves in a
larger context——as part of a
national Gay Liberation Movement.

At this meeting, conversation’
centers around the activities of the
Movement in Philadelphia. news of
which is offered by a medical
student who has just transferred
from an eastern. state school and
who recently joined the group. The
talk flows easily and pipe-snioking
GSP president Debbie Boyle jokes
about the fact that the group,
favoring rap sessions. has steadily
postponed business meetings.

Boyle, a senior majoring in
Administration of Justice. said
members of GSP are also members
of other gay activitists‘ groups and
she plans to keep in -touch with the
political activities expected in
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia this
year. ,

’ ’ said Green-

I’m here to serve,
wald.

Job discrimination and social-

animosity are the points of conflict;

between the gay individual and a
traditionally heterosexual world.

Job discriminatin can be fought
and peer pressure can be dealt
with. But the deciding factor in a

gay person’s survival may be how .

‘he perceives himself——whether he
_holds a constructive self image or a
self identity that is frustrated and
lost.

The ﬁrst step in accepting one‘s

sexuality and coming to terms with

it, is to identify oneself with that

sexuality without associating it_

with negative value judgements.
.‘.‘People are afraid to connect
those words——dyke, lesbian, gay-

with themselves. Now I’m willing

tovsay I'm a dyke...that I have the
capacity to love some women. It
doesn't mean I’ve fundamentally
changed. I’m still "the same
person,” said Pritchard.

This is how one gay individual
views her sexuality. But there is a
wide spectrum of self-perceptions
among gays ranging from the
“gay is personal” to the “gay is
political,” or ranging in degrees of
the political spectrum from the
conservative who identiﬁes with
the “homosexual” label, a clinical
term, to those who identify with
“gay.”

“I consider myself not to be a
homosexual, but a gay person, a
faggot and a feminist," says

Hughes, calling the difference in

terms analagous to the difference
\betwee_n ‘_‘_c3lored” and “black.”

“homosexual is a clinical term. A
gay person is into a political
analysis of his sexuality. It is
taking pride in the fact that he is
unmasculine. That he isn't
pathologically aggressive. It is
when people say, ‘You're a foggot,
you’re -effeminte, you’re nothing
better than a woman.’ We think
the most important process for
chauvinist heterosexual men is how
to 'un-become obnoxious hyper-
aggressive males, how to become
more gay, sucessfully gay. This is
something un-gay people have to
learn.” .
For Pritchard, the politics of being
gay is closely linked with the
politics of being a ' woman.
Commenting on heterosexual-

_'homosexu'al tensions within the

feminist movement early in this
decade, she said, “Maybe I’m
naive, but I see less and less within
the women's movement of this
gay-straight split. My hair; is that
gay women were able to convince
straight woment that it is not
deviant but part of a growth
process. We’ve raised people's
consciousness in the movement
around lesbianism.”

This connection between gender
and sexuality runs deeper than
organization politics and consci-
ousness-raising. A lesbian is a
woman before even discovering her
sexuality, subject to the "socializa-
tion process common to all women
in a patrarchal society. The
manifestations of this can be seen
in a character referred to by some
as “the old hard line dyke," or as
in the phenomenon of the

butch-femme syndrome.

The butch-femme syndrome is the
picture of all society's stereotypes
surrounding the lesbian, and for
many years the personification of
the lesbian's self image.

“Coming from a society who
assumed that people who loved
members of their same sex were
perverted, these people were ali-
enated from the sources of power.
That is the formation of the deviant
in society,” said Prichard.

One way lesbians dealt with this,
according to Pritchard, “was to
exaggerate all the rhetoric of
straight society and_'the role play-
ing‘of two partners~—-a male and a
This led’ into the creation
of the butch-femme syndrome.”

This butch-femme‘ syndrome,
which has parallels among male
gays, epitomized the destructive-
ness of social judgment . on
homosexuality. When role playing
identies are super-imposed on or
evenﬁsubstituted for real self
identies, there is a problem.

Helping guys to achieve a sense of
self-worth and positive identiﬁca-
tion as a group has been a credit to
the relatively young Gay Liberation
Movement.

“Without a doubt it is a
generational phenomena," ‘Prit-
chard "said, speaking of the
butch-femme syndrome.

“My gay friends are just not like
many older people who are into
traditional roles. The women’s
movement has had impact on the
way we think of lesbians. ,For_me it
is a growth experience, It is not
deviance.

many gays, notably those on the
most radical end of the political
spectrum, see bisexuality as a
cop-out. The Radicalesbians, a gay
organization with a reputation for"
polemics, views bisexuals as gays -
who are afraid to break from
heterosexuality and hide behind
the disguise of bisexuality.

Pitt has begun or finished
construction on ﬁve buildings this
year. The completed structures are
attractive and functional, although
builders have had to cope with
material schedule delays of up to
one year _

The Learning Research and
Development Center, completed
last spring, contains nine floors of
special facilities including futuristic
classrooms, a completely equipped
demonstration facility, sound proof
laboratories and a computer center.

The Center's unique design is
topped‘ by a lounge offering a
fantastic view of the Pitt—-CMU-
Schenley Park area.

The American Institute for Re-
search Building is undergoing
construction to fill in the first two
floors. The spider-like building will
expand to include the psychology
department in addition to the
existing Library of Informational
Sciences.

,Construction has begun on a

 BYIRENE SCHMIDT
Work and study. Two things

5-‘Inning the ranks of famous fuzzies like Fidel Castro, Blackbeard,
"King Herod and Abraham Lincoln, Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar broke
"out in hair this summer. First he showed it off and then he shavedit
‘off, barely in time for the Freshmen Reception, so they say.

going from Pitt to poverty.
Approximately 400 students will
take advantage of the work-study
program at Pitt this year, according
to Work-Study Coordinator Debbie
Rupert. These students, ranging
from freshmen through graduate

‘ students will fill requests for help

from departments all over the
University, and off-campus.

“Work-study students are deﬁ-
nitely needed at Pitt,” said Rupert.
“I usually have many more
requests than students to fill
them.”

After a needs analysis has been
done on a student’s aid application,
aid at Pitt,is determined, with the
office aiming to grant half of their
funds as scholarships and grants,
and half as “self-help,” including
loans and work-study. According
to Rupert, work-study is a popular
form of self-help with students,
since it involves no long-term
repayment, hinging on an uncer-
tain future. -_ -

“I‘ve had many kids ‘request
work-study, and sometimes stu-

dents will cancel loans in order to -

utilize the work-study program,”

’ said Rupert.

Work-study jobs are allocated
through the use of information
sheets given to both the depart-
merits’ requesting the aid, and to
the student applying for a job. The
Work-study Office then attempts

!to match job preference listed by

students with those available.

“First of all, I try to make the job
educational for the student,” said
Rupert. “That gets pretty tough,
though, since a lot of the jobs ask
for clerical work or the most basic
types of assistance. So Itry at least
to place the ‘student in the depart-
ment in which he‘s majoring.”

When rial] ‘ student ,’f.a“cc'epts a
work-study position’, both the
responsibilities  the rewards
are clearly, delineated. Although
there is contract, thestudent is
asked togsignfa jbb responsibility
forra'eiqi3aining Iézhat is expect of
him, the pay procedure,‘the length
oi the job, and the process for
q itting agiven job.

The hdurs and the maximum
ehrnings" for worlt-study are fixed,
rlégardlessv of further need.

Hreshmen, for example, can work

 more than 12 hours per week
and earn up to $700. Both hours
and earnings increase as the
student continues longer with the
school. A graduate student with
sufficient need can work 15 hours
each. week and earn up to $1300 per
yiiearil Although no student is
ﬁequired to ‘work the maximum
um'ber of hours possible, the
University will not-compensate him
or the money through another
form of- aid. _
- Job opportunities throughout the
work-study program are varied.
Only part-time work is provided
during the academic year, but

Earning While Learning  

full-time positions are available
through the spring and summer
sessions. Not only does work-study
involve off-campus positions, but it
is also possible for those students
returning home for the summer to
receive work-study jobs in their
hometowns. According to Rupert,
this is possible almost anywhere in

the state, not only in the larger‘

cities. ,
Approximately 65 per cent of

summer work-study work off-'

campus said Rupert. Of these,
many choose work in local YMCA‘s
and high schools.

The work-study program has had
some difficulties, according to
Rupert, because departmental
supervisors have received bad im-
pressions from students, in part‘-
cular freshman, who have not been
able to cope with the added
pressure.

“Sometimes freshman simply
can’t handle a new environment, a
heavier work load, and a job at the
same time; This has left a bad
impression in some of the depart-
ments,” said Rupert. 

Work-study students can_be fired,
and it is also possible to change
jobs within the academic year,

providing a substantial explanation’

is given. In order to lessen the
possibility of a continuing strain
between students and supervisors,
Rupert is sending out a new

Pitt Students StuclyAbroad  

U BY BILL HADUCK

:’ A number of people took
advantage of Pitt’s educational
programs this summer by leaving
the campus completely behind. By
several thousand miles.

The study abroad programs at Pitt
have been expanded over the years
so now a student wishing leave his
native shores behind for a summer
has a_ choice of applying for
scholarships, seeking help from
grants, or just plain paying his own
way. The accomodations range
from university dormitories to
private homes.

Ollie Cargil, a junior in elemen-
tary education, received a Wo-
;.,, men's International Club award

‘I

and went to England to study,

courses in open education and
primary education.

“It was very easy,” Cargil said,
“It mainly consisted of visits to
schools. There was no real
classroom situation so it was very
relaxing.

“That was in Somerset out in the
country. The people were very
nice, very friendly. When we went
to London, though, it was a little
different. The people were much
colder. I guess its like most big
‘cities ‘in that respect.” ‘

Cargil said other differences lie in
9 the accomodations. “Out in

Somerset it was a really small

town, and the people cared. Maids

cleaned the rooms and the food was
good. But when we stayed in

London, in the University of

London dorms, the food was

horrible. _

really that great.”

Judith Lawniczak, a junior in
industrial engineering, won a Pitt
Nationality Room Scholarship to
study in Poland.

“Poland really surprised me,”
she said, “You always hear about
communism and suppression of the
church and all that, and] really
expected to see policemen watch-
ing you everywhere you went. The
only policemen I really saw'were
/ the ‘ones directing traffic. Just lik

 here. ‘
S “The people were unbelievably
friendly. We asked one guy where
a good place for seafood was, and
he not only told us, he took us
there.” I
She said education in Poland is

London really wasn’t_

steeped in culture. “Think of it
this way,” she said, “They just
celebrated the 600th year of their
university (Jagiellonian University
in Cracow). Here we’re just
getting ready to celebrate the 200th
year of our country.

“The Poles it seems have more
respect for their country. They are
Polish people in the Polish

country, ” she said.

Former President Richard Nix-
on’s resignation speech was
broadcast in Cracow, Lawniczak
said, and she told of what she
called a “reverse reaction".

“The Poles mostly wanted to see
our reaction while we were looking
to see theirs. They seemed almost
as concerned as we did, though.
They liked Nixon and they were

sorry to see him go.”

Quite a different reaction came
from Scandinavia where Frederick
Andres, a graduate student in
physical education studied at the
University of Oslo, Norway.

“They felt Nixon and his cohorts
had made fools of America. They
thought he deserved what he got.
They said we could send them
Kissinger though.”

The University of Oslo compares
in size with Pitt Andres said.
“Only its a lot more attractive.
One per cent of the cost of each
building is spent each year for ﬁve
years to purchase art work to
complement the appearance of the

. building.
“The dorms aren’t really up to

typical American standards,” he
said, “They’re a lot more quaint.”

He said the entire visit was very
enjoyable and the people were very
calm and friendly. “There wasn’t

years of English language in their
schools.” I

Judy Sangl, who just completed
her second summer in Afganistan
told of living with an Afgan family.

“Actually, anyone in Afganistan
who would take a foreigner into
their hom can be taken to be not
very typical. Most of those families
are from the upper classes,” she
said.

Organizational Structure

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or services
offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments. These are
textbooks new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All buying for these
areas is premised on three basic principles. First the item must be required
for a given course or program of the University. Items of this type are
naturally the textbooks, used books, and paperbacks. Second, trade depart-
ment items are made available that are necessary to supplement and com-
plement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic signifi-
cance of the University. Third, supply department on the lower floor has
supply items for your every need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hun-
dreds of other items. Fourth, sundries department has all the professional
items, engineering supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the
availability of many items extremely professional.

Newly published sooxs or GENERAL INTEREST, both hard cover and
paperback are onthe street floor. More than 16,000 paperback and 12,000

cloth titles are displayed in separate sections by subiect catagories. gPeriod- j

Richard “Dickie" Betts—Capricorn
CP02l3. Thank God it's not
another “Ramblin'_‘Man". that‘s
all I've got to say! It at times
borders on that, but with the
singers and added pedal steel a
true country air is present whereas
the Allmans had a fake sound, to
them. .

Richard has put together ‘an
extremely tight album of songs
about nature...Southern land-/
scapesand Spanish _Moss crawl out
of the album. Despite the heavy-
handed grits and cornbread .

atmosphere of the album the music .

is well played and comes across as
a serious attempt at conveying
whatithe misunderstood South is all -
about. A ,
Capricorn has heard one too many
times that they have captured the
Southern ‘band on record and they
have capture the Southern band on
record. The question is: what is the
Southern Band? It’s really ' a
feeling within the group that
reflects the locale of the group [ie]
Allmans are ‘Macon so they are"
bluesy and laid-back. ‘
Side two is the strong point to this
LP because of the instrumentaion.
it consists of two non-vocal tunes,
featuring John Hughey on pedal
steel, Chuck Leavell (the piano
impersonator from‘ the Allman) on
keyborad, Dickie and the one and
only Vassar Clements on ﬁddle...
"Hand Picked" is fourteen
minutes and moves .continously
throughout with trade offs between
theplayers. Overall easy listening
music done extremely well. '
if you can't seem to get that
Southern feeling from the music,
Richard has included a water color

‘for your enjoyment so you can

actually see what people like

Not that they're beyond criticism
or tccliiiically hard to set out on
paper. but one must have the
understanding of what goesibehind
the music of those people. Simple
things like sound systems have

bccndevelopcd into an entirc'Dead '

enterprise and even their guitars
arc being n1a11ut"actu1'ed by their
own people to assure the finest
qttality, as are their records...this
one certainly included.

Garcia‘s own tastes

in music

always seems to come out in a Dead '

album. "Workingman's Dead" is
the prime example with him using
the pedal steel in such rare form.

011 this album, as was shown on the

Saunders-Garcia LP, he has an.-

acute sense of rhythm that pushes
“When
the Hunter (and it is Bob) gets
captured by the Game" speaks to
the fact that Jerry's music revolves
aroundmore than one musical axis.
A surprising tune to find on the
album isthe Stones’ “Let’s Spend
the Night Together” and even

more surprising is the fact that it. 1

could be done so well without
soundin like a Stpnes tune. With
his guitar work Garcia transforms
the song from a straight [rock
number into a more musically and
emotiio/nally melodic song.

Where Clapton’ fails in his
to do other material
rather than his own, Garcia suc-
ceeds. The virtues are in the artists
progress, which clearly shows
growth on the part of Garcia and
the stagnation on the part\ of
Clapton. .

Nobody can come close to the
style of Garcia...his guitar could
bring a treed coon out-of a’willow
and into the hunter's clutches. It’s
a whine that entices the game.

(Continued from Page 22)

A khis deal the talent of each as

singer-songwriter-player shines
through.

J.D.Souther has been a long time
friend of Eagles’ Glen Frey, begin-
ning with their adventures in
Longbraneh Penneywhistle. That
friendship resulted in J.D.'s
helping on "Desperado" and
numerous other Asylum acts. His
own album on Asylum was an
overlooked masterpiece as was his
extensive work on Linda Ronstadt's
"Don't Cry Now.“ The lyrical
content of his material is so well
mixed with his melodic and har-
monic structures because of its

 .__,;natu1‘e...he is one of the few ballad

writers of today who transcend
the mediocrity of popular song-
‘writing. ,
"Deep. Dark and Dreamless"
describes the kind of evenings
you'll have if you worry about that
“Lost Love"...when even shadow

don’t look right. “Pretty Good-
byes" is the set—up for a talk on
leaving your love because “I've
been lonelier with you than with-
out." Both songs depend on a
balance of well placed background

haromonies to support the central _

theme and with the vocalization he

‘has, it's held up perfectly--they are
 mix of country-soul...reaching for

the open-ended and yet solid
seventh is there to tingle the nerve
endings.

First there was the Byrds, then
came the Flying Burrito Brothers

along came Manassass...now Chris
Hillman is part of theSHF Band.

His association with the folk-rock,
country-rock and Manassass-rock
format has placed him in a strange
position. He has never been given
his own style because of his
affiliations...up until now.

Chris Hillman shows on this LP
how fine a lyricist he was...co-
author of “Both of Us Bound to
Fall" with Stills is now the author
of his own tunes.

“Rise and Fall” displays ‘the
diversity of this man...he is pri-
marily a bassist but shines on
mandolin. His performance on
“Last of the Red Hots” is another
fine example of the work he does on
that instrument. Adding dobro on
this cut is Al Perkins, another man
with a list of credentials too long to
mention. “Safe At Home” is a
rockin’ number about the vices that
bring men down...the bottle to the
spoon.

Again Perkins‘ work, this time on
fuzz pedal steel. adds another
seemingly-lost dimension to rock
and Paul Harris‘ organ (Manassass

John Sebastian, Ohio Knox...)
contributes yet another musical
path for the song to take.

Surprisingly enough the complexi-
ties produce a very simple soun-
ding song.

Richie Furay comes from a broken
home of rock atmosphere. Buffalo-
Springfield disbanded leaving him
to pursue his country style with
Poco. When Jim Messina left Poco

they were as good as gone leaving
all the bounce and spirit up to
Richie who was then pitted up
against Paul Cotton's rock guitar.

The bounce of Poco has always
been attributed to Richie and it's
clear that his departure has de-
pleted them of it, but strange as it
may seem, it hasn’t come into this
band...at least with his songs.

His two tunes are of more of a rock
nature than would be expected.

"Believe Me" and "The Flight of
the Dove" are strighter rock num-
bers (the latter strangely remini-
scent of "Crazy Eyes") and disap-
pointing when compared to his
other songs. His unmistakable
vocals are as sure as ever but his
guitar is lost amidst the produc-
tion...this isn't a jam album. It's a
series of good tight songs with
emphasis on lyrics.

ln. general this LP is a smash
collection of talents and comes off
with the good as usual engineering
of Asylum. It won't leave you
ready to jump out of your window
with melancholy or set you on your
feet dancing ‘till the Doctor Scholls
give out, but your ears will be
thankin' your change purse for
buying it. ‘

'l‘here's a story about Alice Cooper
that I really enjoy. It's the one
about him killing the chicken. The
real story is that he had a chicken

   

 

on stage with him and he decided -

to throw it into the audience where
the kids promptly tore it apart so
they could have relics from an Alice
concert. At another time Alice
showed us what crowds would do
when he tossed money into the
seats and people were tearing each
other apart for a‘ few bucks.
If Eric Clapton would take Derek

and the Dominoes albums on tour
and pitch them into the fans’ seats,

we might have an event similar to ,

an Alice concert. Which just goes
to prove what an artist will do for
his paying audience. Like make. an
album...?

What this.alb_um needs is a bass
player like Jack Bruce, a drummer
like Ginger Baker, a producer like

Feliz Pappalardi and a naméiliikei

Cream. Unfortunately those 4' 
people are inaccessible and it isn’t

“Places" Ignores Characters 

BY ADRIAN McCOY

Going Places, the new work by
French ﬁlm maker Bertrand Blier,
is the odyssey of two countercul-‘
ture desperados. But due to
technical ﬂaws and a general lack
of structure, the viewer is left with
the feeling that neither he nor the
protagonists have gone anywhere.

In the ﬁne" old tradition of Easy
Rider, two drifters travel around
France, stealing cars and motor-
cycles, food and money. By the
end of the ﬁlm, they have
witnessed one murder, one suicide,
and the requisite amount of nudity
and perversity,

The development of the plot runs
counter to the entireidea of an
odyssey. ‘The protagonists exper-
iencelnany unusual things, but by
the end of the picture, they don’t
seem to have been affected or
changed in any signiﬁcant way.
There is a great deal of potential for
the actor to convey a sense of
dynamism, change or organic
growth, but nobody seems to be
moving at all.

The entire production follows a
rigid formula. .All the usual
elements of a movie made in the

'60s are present here, with a tough
of Gallic ﬂavoring in the form of a
periodically clever dialogue. There
is nothing new or exciting and the
viewer is left with the feeling that
he has been there before.

The plot, or what there is of one,
is highly contrived. Chauffers just
do not walk away from limosines
with the doors open and the motor
running and young girls don’t
usually have breakthroughs at
family picnics and decide to go off
with the people who are stealing
the family car. A realistic film such
as this one cannot make these kind
of demands on an audience. ,

There are a few scenes that stand
out, but they are only standing on
shock value. Even so, the shock is.

abused by repetition, so that it too. ‘

eventually subsides and fades.
The image of th road should have
been central here. Something is
needed to make a film like this
hang together as a coherent
structure. The idea of the highway
carrying the characters through
their journey ‘would have done._this
nicely. Instead it is used as an
indispensible but somewhat
bothersome scene change device.
As a technical work, the ﬁlm
seems as though it had never seen

A nice sense of humor threads its
way through the confusion, indi-
cating that there was some kind of

sensitivity to the human condition
behind the work, but unfortunate-
ly, technical ﬂaws hamper its
expression. At the end of the ﬁlm,
our heroes drive off into the sunset

faces as if th_ey had only gone out

stretches ahead of them, and the

-.'_A ‘short vacation in the school year
doesn't mean thatthe movies stop
coming. They may still be losers,
but the celluoid keeps piling up.
Actually, unlike the middle of the
dead summer season, early fall
brings some pretty good stuff out to
the theatres. The current releases
may not be the big budget names
. (and possible bombs) of the
— -. lucrative Christmas season, but are
characterized by low-key, artistic-

That latter term refers to a movie
that_may be quite different from
“what is usually offered, with a low

¥:k.fore considered to rather risky.

they worked their way from a
three-story walk-up to a suburban
palace. And it has hit a lot of the
younger people who are ﬁnally
grasping what their parents are
talking about.

Duddy Kravitz is not a hard-hit-
ing, bit-em-in-the-back success
story in the vien of Room at the
Top. The protagonist is not a
slick-backed, single minded con-
niver, but an undereducated
younger son who tries to gain the
affection of a father and uncle who
so obviously favor his older

‘brother, while following the
dreams and lifelong maxims of a
respected grandfather. Duddy
uses people all right, live a naive,
epileptic boy and a loving
French-Canadian irl who loves him
but is not blind to his faults, but he
is constantly wrestling with the
dilemma of people vs. his dream.

In the way the movie has hit the
public. as well as the performance
of the leading actor, Richard
Dreyfuss, the ﬁlm seems highly
reminiscent of last year’s sleeper,
American Grafitti. in its handling
of innocence. Duddy goes farther

though. corrupting innocence with’

the slimy ingredients necessary for
“success." Both ﬁlms, also,
tended to be overrated, a common
enough occurence when a ﬁlm
nobody expects anything from

cal school in the film “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.”

fairly good ﬂick, essentially a
character study that is sensiti/ely

‘handled, and it should remain a

“nice little story” if the publicity
types don’t get out of hand. They
seem to have a little Duddy Kravitz
in them, too.

‘Another “sleeper,” in a sense, is
the re-release of the 1930 Marx
Brothers ﬂick, Animal Crackers.
The movie has "been out of
circulation for over a decade
because the film’s prints and the
film's rights were owned by two
different sets of people. When
Universal let the ﬁlm rights of the
orginal Broadway play revert —to
playwrights Morrie Ryskind and
George Kaufmann. (actually, his

estate) back in the late ﬁfties,
nobody cared, and the movie was
taken out of circulation. I

In the past decade,. the Marx
Brothers enjoyed quite a revival,
and dusty old prints that may have
been mildly received on initial
release were now greeted with

_hysteria, even some of the late

Marx Brothers’ bombs like The Big
Store or Love Happy.

The one Marx Brothers movie that
was not making frenzied round of
the revival houses was Animal
Crackers, which got to be quite a
myth among dedicated Marx fans.
Well, believe it or not, nobody at
Universal was negotiating for'the
rights to get that ﬂick back to the

theatresnapparently with the _‘

corporate mindblock that some-
thing that's been lying around that
long can't be worth much.
Fortunately, the people who did
have the rights were anxious to sell
them, which they managed to do
shortly before the Academy A-
wards this year. . -

Well now Animal Crackers is back

would get (meaning the ﬂick will
not be available to TV or revival
houses for a few years). lt’s hard to

(and a lot of money) by spilling
as much blood in the least tasteful
way possible, while making rather
ugly characterizations of children
and putting down women as much
as possible.

His super-macho flicks from The
Wild Bunch up to and including
last summer's Pat Garrett and Billy
the Kind have‘ been mostly
thrill-seeking, repulsive movies
that occasionally give some miso-
gynistic critics and audiences a
vicarious sadistic pleasure.

So, to someone who doesn’t relish
wading through a bloody sea of
intestinal parts. the prospect of
seeing Peckinpah's newest. Bring
Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, is
not to make one’s popcorn hot.
Well. it's nice to get a surprise,
even one as grim as Alfredo.
probably the hardest. grittiest story
of greed, revenge, love and hate
ever put on the screen.

It almost makes one think that
Peckinpah isn't the lucky no-talent
he appears to have been. "Ilse iilni

is just as ugly and repulsive as all
his previous ones. perhaps even
more so because Peckinpah has
learned a few things about he
movies. For example. it would be
just a cheap thrill to show the
disembodied. exhumed head; but
it's nauseatingly dramatic tokeep
the thing in a burlap bag covered
by ﬂies.

The story concerns the depths one
man will sink to in a quest for the
easy money he thinks will solve all
the problems._ The head in
question is the token of revenge of
a wealthy Mex'Fcan who wishes the
hapless Garcia dead for knocking
up his daughter. He vows to pay
for the head with $1 million
dollars, a price that attracts a lot of
slick killers who manage to draw a
down-on-his-luck American (War-
ren Oates) into the race for the
head.

And in the best of traditions like
The Treasure of Sierra Madre.
Oates loses all to win that prize.
He need the money to get himself

and his lady love out the of tourist
traps of modern—day Mexico. a
prison that's expanded in his mind-.

As he loses more and sinks lower.
the head itself becomes an
obsession. an obsession that comes
to mean more than just the money.

Alfredo still has the famous
Peckinpah touches of casual
violence. whether it's-a rough time
in bed or a sudden assault in the
seemingly peaceful countryside
(where Kris Kristofferson makes a
short appearance as a greasy hood
bent on rape). The bodies pile up.
so much so that at times it would
seem amusing if the story were not
quite so dramatic. But for a
change. Peckinpah's anti-feminism
seems to have mellowed, to the
point that his hero is allowed some
romanticism and his _‘h€I‘Olll€ is
allowed to be a real women.

The movie is so powerfully
executed that one wonders if
Peckinpah was suddenly blessed
with an enormous lot of luck or
talent. or if he's just been fooling
us all this time.

put together both McCabe and
Mrs. Miller and Brewster
McCloud. ‘ ,

He's either lauded as the greatest
new director or a schmuck. Unlike
many directors. he doesn't stick to
one genre. in fact. he never sticks  _
to the same genre twice. But his A
films always have an unmistake—
able quality. of realism and fantasy
expanded and contracted so much
that both are so glaringly apparent
it's hard to tell them apart.

His latest. California Split, is
putting him back in the critical

doghouse after his highly ac-
claimed Thieves Like Us. His
newest flick is a look at two

gamblers. one a writer groping‘ at
respectability (George Segal) who
finds his gambling addiction H
threatening to his position. and the
other a free-wheeling character
(Elliot Gould) who lives and enjoys A ‘Q
his vice. The movie is interesting :5
for the most part. and holds your
attention, but after it's over you
walk out of the theatre mumbling
“but what was it all about."

It's hard to find a plot in California .
Split. The two gamblers meet, .
make some money. lose some
money. split up and finally find
themselves in Reno when Segal is
suddenly in the throes of a winning
streak. In the greatest movie .
gambler tradition. he cleans up the
place. filling a punch bowl with
$100 chip’s.

One of Altman’-s greatest charac-
teristics is knowing what 
expected of a particular genre, and '- 
then completely frustrating his
audience by failing to deliver. One
cannot help but feel an initial
disappointment with California V
Split if one has relished such”
gambling films as The Cincinnati
Kid or The Hustler. But with
Altman, you know he’s not going to
even think of those movies. 

California Split is not an easy one - 
to take. and you have to sit back /
and figure out what you’ve just
seen’. He doesn't delve into his
characters much. and instead
tosses them about in a crazy
environment so much that the film
seems less a tale of gambling than
of just two pin pricks in a vast.
uncaring universe where luck. and
luck alone. will spell success .or
failure. 

Another flick making’ the current‘ VT‘)
rounds is Death Wish, a surpris- '
ingly interesting film with a good .
idea that didn’t completely come
off. Charles Bronson plays a
“bleeding heart liberal,”_ a con-
scientious objector from the Kor-
ean War, who turns to vigilantism ,
after thugs kill his wife and rape his
daughter. The New Yorker turns
to the “pioneer spirit of self-
defense” after a trip to Tucson,-
where he learns to harmonize his

earlier role as a gentle soul who
“cares about the

show hardly any emotion when he
learns of his wife's death. But after
that.'the movie turns more to action
and less to character study. so he's
safe. '

The vigilante character is one that
has been enshrined in the
American Western and comic book

Members of the offensive line congratulate Tony Dorsett after paving

BY ANDY BEHREND —

  If you can envision about a dozen
5;.’ guys sloshing their way over hard

cement sidewalks through a steady

9l7'ldrizzle, for, oh 15 miles without

rest, then you can possibly imagine

the rigorous conditioning required
1,’ for cross country running.

Furthermore, when you see these

" ‘ dudes‘wearlng a tranquil expres-

sion—sweating, yes, scowling,

.- no—you might ponder whether a

few screws are missing some-
where.

Fortunately Jim Banner, in his

'5 ‘ninth year as cross country coach

(doubling in the springtime as one
of the country's finest track and
ﬁeld mentors) knows better.
‘ Dauntless as the mailman, these
. unﬂinching runners are simply
preparing themselves for the

  upcoming season, irregardless of
 the‘weather.

Banner thinks his Pitt team stands
a good change of improving upon

  ‘last year’s successful season,
I which, included but one loss in dual

meets (to Penn State), and a ninth
place Eastern finish in the IC4A’s.

“Yes, I am optimistic,” Banner
conceded recently.

. most talented group I’ve ever
N"!

His enthusiasm is not without
foundation. Banner said that each
of his runners had logged
anywhere from 800 to 1,000 miles
of training individually this sum-
mer, more than any group he’s
coached previously.

The returning harriers share their
coach's zeal. Nick Martin, though

should prove invaluable to the
team’s progress.

Add to. these three names the
products of a most enterprising
recruiting season for Banner: Tom
Herman, a pleasant surprise from
Hickory, PA, and perhaps the two
finest_ distance runners in the
WPIAL last year," Mel Boyd of
Ringgold and Dave McDonald from
Churchill. A

The team opens its season
September 21', at the California
State Invitational Meet, in which
the Panthers are defending
champs. The event should be little
more than an earlyjtune-up for
later, more critical meets. ’

Banner realizes he has at his
grasp the nucleus for a prosperous
campaign. But hecancoach onlyto
a certain point._ ' _

“Distance runningis 90% mental
and 10% physical desire and
conditioning. I’d be the best coach
in the world if I could control their
minds.”

With his personnel, maybe all Jim
Banner will have to do this year is
watch his squad break the tape.

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

As good as Tony Dorsett is, he
can't run through people.
Likewise, Bill Daniels can't throw if
he’s ﬂat on his back under 500-odd
pounds of beef.

Without an offensive line to open
some daylight for Dorsett, and
keep defenders away from Daniels,
Pitt will be hard-pressed to repeat
last year’s winning record and bowl
bid.

“We’ll have a real good football
team, if our -offensive line
develops,” said the unit’s coach,
Joe Avezzano.’ “But right now,
we’re not distinguishing ourselves.
It’s an area of concern to our entire
staff.

“I don’t mean to be overly
negative. They’ve worked just
super-hard, but they’re just not
getting the desired results yet.' I
know we’ll ﬁeld five guys that’ll
give us the best effort they have.”

Only two spots are set already,

' with senior veterans Mike Carey at

center and Reynold Stoner at left
guard. Each is talented and
experienced, but replacing gradu-
ates like right guard Ray Olsen and
tackles Dave Wannstedt and Dave
Blandino is no easy task.
Avezzano describes the remaining
talent as “just one big conglomer-
ation of potential. Nobody has
really come to the fore. I can say
that TheoeLawrence (Jr., 6-6, 230)
and Joe Stone (Soph., 6-4"/2, 240)
are the front-runners at the tackle
positions.’ ’

and John Hanhauser (6-2, 225),
juniors Ed Kucharik (6-6, 240) and
Ray Zuraw (6-4, 225) and junior‘
college transfer Dave Treiber z)6-3,
235) are fighting for the wide open I
right guard slot. ~
1t’s too early to say,” said head
coach Johnny Majors. “We have a
game-type scrimmage coming up
on Friday that’ll decide a lot. 6
“We were at our worst yesterday
' (last Wednesday), but we made
some progress today.” Majors was
not alone in his approval of
Thursday’s work. .’ I

Center Mike Carey, who sat out
the drill with a bad ankle (“I hope
to start running on it tomorrow”),
said “We had our best practice
today. We beat the defense pretty
good out there.” No mean
accomplishment, considering how
good the defense has been. “It
might be the toughest we’ll face all
year,” Carey said.

Reynold Stoner agreed: “We
showed some snap out there. If we
can keep that up in a defense-
oriented drill we’ll be all right,
because game situations are really
easier.” _

Everyone seems to have ‘his own
opinion of the line’s brightest
prospects beyond Stoner and
Carey. Avezzano is impressed with
the work of two freshman tackles,
Tom Brzoza (6-3, 235) and Jeff
Matthews (6-5, 230). “But,
experience is the key factor on the
line,’’ Avezzano noted. “There’s a
whole lot to learn, and this season

presents a good opportunity for

these guys.”

Majors mentioned Treiber as
“making progress,” and Carey
praised the work of Theo -Lawrence.

“He’s the only other guy with
much experience,” Carey said.
“He started one game at tackle for
us:-‘S. last year-” ‘

Stoner complimented tackle Joe
Stone and guards Kucharik and
Pelusi. “Mike Shaffer’s (Jr., 6-2,
200) doing well at center with
Carey hurt, too,” Stoner said.

Opinions were just as varied on
the line’s outlook for 1974. Even
after Wednesday’s practice, Avez-
zano said. ‘*’Today we were up, but

a Soccer: Pitt’S 

  Biggest Secret

BY ANDY BEHREND

Despite last year’s renaissance in
Pitt’s athletic programs, soccer
remained one of the,'university’s
best kept secrets. '

The highest attendance at a
varsity game in 1973 was about
sixty people, many of whom were
inebriated while enjoying the
preceding Pitt-Navy football game.
The ensuing soccer game served as
their cold shower. A

As a matter of fact, last year’s
team might’ have found a brisk

drenching profitable, as evidenced »

by their four win, eight loss, one tie
record, in a season of truly
“unfulfilled potential”, any
'coach’s most hated cliche.

And graduation has depleted the

team’s up the middle field.

centers in the fullback, halfback"

and forward positions. .

lettermen and last year’s talented
freshmen squad, now eager for
varsity time. In addition, several
transfers and a handful of new
faces via a busy ‘recruiting season
from Bemis could mean the return
to winning soccer.

Even more notable is the tough‘

conditioning procedure, instituted
for the ﬁrst time at its fullest extent
by Bemis and assistant coaches Joe
Luxbacher and John Abajace.

The most frequently spoken
comment from the veterans after
the first day of practice was,
“That’s more than we ran all last
year.” Absolutely true.

The early good news, lies in the
offensive frontjline and a corps ,o
able halfbacks. e

he had predicted just that kind’ of
performance: “A 'lot of ups and

mood because we've been

Stoner was much more optimistic:
“It’s just a matter of getting used
to the guy playing next to you,-
developing pride in ourselves as a
unit, and becoming familiar with
the plays. It’s good to see these-
younger players pushing eac ‘

just coincidence, but today we were

“Last year, Coach came in and
taught some old dogs new tricks. —
This year’s line is younger, quicker
and stronger, and his job ought to
be that much easier. We’re gonna
get together.”

Majors, ever the diplomat, walked .
“It won’t be

pride and a lot of hard work. But,
sure, something can be done. And
we won’t be standing still.”

Perhaps Carey’s summary said 

most: “The whole team’s success
depends on us, and I think we’ll be’
all right. I just hope the defense
can bail us out the ﬁrst couple
games.”

  Steve Blass Is
There To Root  

I

It’s like old times, with pitcher
Steve Blass in uniform, horsing
around in the Pittsburgh Pirate
dugout. Whether or not the
one-time ace starter ever takes the
mound again, he says he‘s there
to root.

“I sit in the dugout and I root.
I’ve always rooted for the Pirates,”
says No. 28, who just two seasons
ago was Pittsburgh’s most effective
starter. '

“I want to help this team by‘

pitching,” he added from the same
locker stool where he was
interviewed during the ’71 World
Series. " M '

But today he’s a non-roster
player, laboring with pitching
Coach Don Osborn before each
game on abysmal control that led to
93 walks in 56 2-3 minor league
innings this season.

For a moment before a crucial
game with Philadelphia last week,
-he looked the free-spirited Blass of
old. _ . '

He and several other pitchers
were running football pass patterns
in the outfield, catching long-bomb
baseballs thrown by Dave Parker.

. It was that kind of horseplay and

humor that kept the Pirates loose in
past seasons, and Blass," the

_ uniformed spectator now, may help

the Pirates in their stretch drive.
“It’s pretty tough to clown when

you're not contributing,” he said»

after the Pirates whipped the
Phillies Tuesday night. '
Whether he ever again pitches for
the Pirates may depend on how he
responds to some eye training

techniques aimed at restoring his

control.

When he was 19-8 with the Pirates
in 1972, Blass could knock over-a
bowling pin with a slider at 60 feet,
six inches.

Yet he walked 84 batters in 89
innings in 1973 en route to a 3-9
record and a '9.81 earned run
average. The control worsened this

season with Charleston, ,W.Va., in

the International League and he
finished with a 2-8 record and 9.85
ERA.

Blass joined the Pirates last
month on the West Coast and
began working with an eye
specialist at the University of
California. ‘

“You have no idea what a thin line
there is between my pitching then
and now,” he said, “and”. that’s
why I think we can get this thing
straightened out.”

host of capable but inexperienced
players.

The back half of the ﬁeld is, at this
time, most kindly referred to as
vague.

“The fullback situation is wide
open,”said Bemis remorsefully, a
circumstance prompted by the loss
of all four starters from last year.

Returning are lettermen Ernie
Gross and Mark Venanzi. They
would appear to have a inside
track, but Bemis hinted otherwise.

“Last year’s freshmen crew could
move right in,’? Bemis said,
referring to Jack Dunmyer, Stan
Sbei and a slimmed-down Kim
Blasko.

If the fullback situation is vague
as to who will start, the goalie
predicament is downright perplex-
ing.'

“We have four freshmen candi-
dates, each‘ possessing certain
skills,” Bemis remarked. “At this
point they’re equal.” In any case,
a neophyte will start in goal, and
that’s quite a bit of pressure to
handle; _

.As the team preps for its season
opener at Bucknell September 14
(the scheduled game with the
University of Mexico was can-
celled), all the members are aware
of thecohesiveness that must play’
a major role this year‘. Bemis
reﬂected on this point.

“Perhaps last year there was a“~

tendency to depend too much upon
individual play. The game must be
a team effort.” '

Then the soft-spoken coach 1

switched gears and confidently
pronounced, “I think this team
could really surprise people.”

News: In what kind of physical
._ tidition did the players report to

camp, overall?

Majors: I’d say that most of our
players reported in ,excellent
physical condition. Most reported
in at the weight that they feel they
can play best at. And I also think
that they have done quite a bit of
conditioning over the summer—
that's an indication that they do
want to win. I would like to see
some. more hot weather come up in
the next few days before we play
Florida State. '
Pitt News: Your injury list over the
period at camp and since you have
returned has been growing almost
every’ day. "I’ve noticed Tony
Dorsett sitting out quite a few
practives and other regualrs such
as Billy Daniels kept out of practice
consistently with "what have been
reported as minor injuries. Are you
keeping’ your regulars, who have
only minor bumps and bruises, out
of the drills just to be on the safe
side?

Majors: Well I think‘ you always
like to be on the safe side when it
comesgto a playerthat you‘know
more about, that you've seen
before in games. With your others.
you look for alhappy medium. They
all need to play in game type
situations and be hit, tighten up
their muscles and joints and play in
pressure situations. You always
want your . players to -be both.
mentally and physically tough. ‘If
it were a borderline case ‘I'd would
have to say that I would go the
other way and not have I him
practice until ‘he's well. Most
players I think don't want to go
until ‘they've been told by the
trainer or doctor that they are
ready.

 

Pitt News: Are you satisfied with

the depth that you have on both, the '

offense and defense—do you feel
that you can take injuries to some
key personnel and still be able to
play near peak performance? '

Majors: I don‘t think this is ever
true on any football team I've ever
been around. There are some
teams that have the depth not to

_ suffer the letdown that might occur

when-a key man is injured. I know
we’d like to have more depth but I
think we can maintain our level of
efficiency with the loss of some
football players. Naturally there
are some players, that if we would

lose them we would drop off a little . .

bit, but not as much as last year if
we would have lost key players.
The injury list, by the way is ﬁnally
growing less each : day, thank
goodnesss, and I've compared it to
last year and this year is very
comparable to last. When you’re
working two-a-day sessions you’re
more likely to some up with the
littlie nagging injuries that will
keep a player out one; two or even
four orfive days. We are getting
more back to practice. however.
Pitt News: You’ve been quoted by
the local media as being extremely
dissatisfied with the progress the
team has madeto date. Justiwhat
aspect of the game are you most
concerned" about?

Majors: I haven't been pleased yet
because the bad footing at camp
threw some of our timing off.
There are a lot of key people that

listed Pitt as running from 'a veer

operating mainly from an I forma-
tion? Will you have to make any
' major changes to incorporate the
veer? I ‘L '
Majors: We’re running an I
formationbasically, like we did last
year. There are things I liked that
we did last year and I hope we can
continue to execute them again this
year. That’s yet to be seen. We
" did use a veer type offense from the
 last year with Dorsett, Daniels
' and Janasek. We are continuing to
work with this along with some
sounter play to Bruce Murphy, our
. wingback, and we will use more of
the- veer from the I formation.

There will be only minor ‘adjust-

ments if an at all when and if we go

strictly with a veer.

more and will Billy Daniels be

«finest quarterbacks I’ve ever been
around. .We will -be throwing the

struggle this fall because he has
had a knee problem that has slowed
him down and has had the ﬂu the
last few days. He hasn’t made the
progress that he would have like to
himself, and that I would have liked
to see at this point. But-we're
looking for him to practice more in
the next few days.

Pitt News: How do you feel about
Pitt’s schedule and playing three of
the nations top teams?

Majors; I think "it's a very tough
schedule but it's not something I’m
going to sit back and cry over and
moan about, although sometimes it
may help us to think realistically
about our season and predict
certain scores and certain ratings.
Some people have predicted us to
have a very fine season and
sometimes I think they may have
forgotten just who we have to play.
This canralso be used as an asset in
recruiting, because if and when we

not a schedule I have chosen or one

  WATERBEDS

BY G.W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor

Over the past few years Pitt‘s

 intramural program has been

unable to keep pace with the

5’ . increasing demands of the Univer-

sity community. The program has
suffered from not only the inherent

I  ‘ difﬁculties of the urban campus but
- also from a serious lack of funds.

Fortunately, Pitt‘s Intramural De-
partment is finally on the move.
With last year’s success in both
football and basketball, the Athle-
tic Department, which controls the
intramural budget, has been able
to upgrade its services to the
Several
improvements have already been
made and hopefully more will
follow.

Possibly the greatest improve-

. A ment made to the program was the

  Pitt In tramurals Finally 0n The M0 ve

department has been run entirely
by Leo Bemis, a man who has been
greatly overworked in recent years.

In addition to being Intramural
Director, Bemis is the head coach
of the Pitt soccer team and the man
in charge of scheduling the events
at all athletic facilities.

Coach Bemis is extremely dedica-
ted to his work but he has not been
able to keep up with all the
problems facing the program,
expecially during soccer season.

The Athletic Department has
hired Lou Fabian‘ as Assistant
Intramural Director ‘in hopes of
removing some of the burden from
Bemis’ shoulders. Fabian, and his
female associate, Marilyn Ross,
will handle most of the program-
ming and should prove to be
valuable additions to the Intramur-
al Department.

There are a few additional
improvements to p the 

program which are sure to make
the competition more pleasurable.
The Athletic Department recently
installed new lights in Pitt Stadium
which will give the IM omce more
time for the scheduling of games.
They will no longer be forced to
limit the competition to the lone
practice ﬁeld behind Trees Hall.
‘There will be more time to make up
postponed games and a longer
schedule will be possible.

Pitt's recreational facilities have
also been touched by the demand
for better intramural activities.
The paddleball and handball
courts, as well as the squash
courts, have been recently painted,
a restoration which was long
overdue. The tennis courts behind
Trees Hall have also received a
face-lifting over the summer. The
courts were resurfaced so that
players will no longer have to battle
the potholes as well as their

_ opponents.

The most serious problem facing
the program at the present is the
lact of ofﬁcials. The Intramural
Department is prepared to pay
students to act as ofﬁcials for

softball,‘ football, and basketball .

games. However, they have
received little response from
students in the past.

The first intramural activity of the
term will be the annual softball
league which has been very
successful in the past. There will
be six divisions of play: fraternity,
engineering, clubs, graduate-fac-
ulty, women, and independent.
Play will begin_ on Sept. 12 when
the fraternity and engineering
divisions get underway. Anyone
who is interested in playing in any
of the six divisions should sign up
in the Intramural Ofﬁce at 125

.Trees Hall before Sept. 12. Any

students or faculty members who
would like to be ofﬁcials can also
sign up in the Intramural Office.
Hundreds of students and faculty
members participated in the
intramural program last year, but
the IM staff hopes to increase the
number of participants. Notices
will be run in the Pitt News
concerning upcoming events and
registration -dates. Flyers an-
nouncing events will also be placed
on bulletin boards throughout the
campus. .' Further information

A full week of rain has severely

“I’ve never seen a fall like this,”

BY BART MACK
SPORTS EDITOR

He was the greatest freshman
ever to carry the ball in the history
of college football.

But after 1,686 yards, 13
touchdowns, Associated Press first
team All-American, the first frosh
to receive consensus All-American
honors in 29 years, six time
member of the All-East backﬁeld
and countless other accolades,
what can be expected of the
nation’s leading returning rusher
and the first sophomore ever to
named to- Playboy Magazine’s
All-American team?

Tony Dorsett isn’t a man with his
head in the clouds. His success has
not swelled to his ego to the point
of unreality, despite the fact he is

"constantly referred to by his
teammates as “hey, A1l—Ameri-
can.”

-Dorsett is by no means overconﬁ-
dent. For his own good he’d better
not be and he is the first person to
realize it. The upcoming season is
bound to be the toughest of his
collegiate career.

“There’s a lot of defense that will
be keying on me,” Dorsett said in
what has to be the understatement
of the year. “For me to gain
another 1,500 yards would be a
great feat, but you just have to
be realistic about it.” _ ,

Number 33 will be a marked man
starting September 14 in Jackson-
ville against Florida State, and that
status isn’t likely to change
throughout the season. But
“realism" does not scare “T.D."

“If I could gain 1,000 yards, well
then I think I'd be doin’ something
for myself and helping the team
out, too,” Dorsett said.

For Dorsett, whose 5-11, _175
pound frame disguises his true
strength, dancing through the
ranks of opposing linemen who live
for the opportunity to send him
limping off the field, takes its toll.
Last season, after his 265 yard
performance against Northwestern
gave him the national recognition
he deserved, toting the pigskin
became a little more painful.

As the weeks passed, each
opposing defense concentrated
solely on him, for he was the
arrowhead of the Pitt attack. By
the time Pitt’s . ninth contest
(against Notre Dame) arrived,
Dorsett spent most of his practice
time in a sweatsuit, jogging laps to
keep in shape and watching the
team prep for the weekend. The
bumps and bruises were amounting,
as was the affect of running on an

artiﬁcial surface. But against
-Notre Dame Dorsett came up with
the finest individual rushing
performance the Irish had ever
faced.

At Penn State in the regular
season ﬁnale, with the Nittany
Lions Victoriously playing out the
remains of another fourth quarter,
Dorsett took one of the hardest hits
he’ll ever hope to avoid while
sprinting for the end zone. Two
State linebackers had the angle on
him and both met with their heads
down, a sandwich with Dorsett in
the middle. But they could not
keep him out of the game.

Dorsett is used to playing with

pain. In his senior year of high ‘

school, he lead his team to an
almost perfect season. The only
game they lost was one in wlﬁch
Dorsett sustained a mild concus-
sion which sent him to the
sidelines. For his own good, the
coaches would not let him return to
the game, although without him
they knew their chances of

Dorsett had to be restrained by his
coaches to keep him off the field.

These injuries that nagged Dor-
sett last year have popped up
again, along with some everyday“
illnesses, to keep him out of thii
heavy going so far in this you-ni 
season, or so the trainers say.
Dorsett has recently returned to.
scrimmages after sitting out all of
the rough contact at football camp
at the Pitt Johnstown Campus.

“At camp I had a lot of
adversities,” Dorsett said. “First I
pulled a groin muscle,‘ then my’
hamstrings tightened up, then I
came down with the flu and tha ,,._5g;‘
developed into sinusitis, which was A
a new one on me, but my eyes were
swollen, I couldn’t see that good
and I was getting bad headaches.

“Once I got back to Pittsburgh, it
was just a matter, of getting my
timing back,” he coninued. “It
isn’t Coach Majors that’s keeping
me out of the drills, it’s the
injuries. Right now I've got a _
bruised elbow and the coachem
don’t want to put me in so the ' A ‘
injury won’t get aggravated.”

Over the summer, Dorsett follow-
ed a conditioning program that
consisted mainly of running hills
and lifting weights, in an effort to
put on a few extra pounds. Back in
the spring, Majors had expressed
an interest in building Dorsett up to
190 pounds, but that wish has yet
to become a realization. ‘

I was lifting only to put weight and
strength on up top,” Dorsett. said. -'
“I didn’t do any lifting with my

Sherrill, Haffner HeadMajors’

+"'\



Although Johnny Majors is an
extraordinary football coach, he
couldn’t possibly handle all the

_ intricacies of the coaching game on

his own. A large staff of assistant
coaches is necessary and Majors is
fortunate enough to have one the
most outstanding groups of subor-
dinates in college football.

Jackie Sherrill heads this young
staff as Assistant Head Coach. He
is the man who is in charge of
coordinating theworkload for he
remainder of the staff. In addition,
he is also defensive coordinator, a
position he ahs held under Coach

!..Majors since 1970 when the two
.4: Jere still at Iowa State.

1-.

Sherrill is a native _of Biloxi,
Mississippi where he played high
school football and earned a spot on
‘the All-State team. He also was
given honorable mention recogni-
tion as a high school All-American.
He then continued his career at
powerful Alabama where he was
a three-year letterman, playing as
many as seven different positions,
maily linebacker, and fullback. He
played on two National Champion-
ship teams at Alabama, in 1964 and

.1966, and captained the 2928

Orange Bowl victory over’ Nebraska
' 1966.

lg.--qélierill is ‘no stranger to the bowl

"game circuit either. Besides the
1966 Orange Bowl, he played in the
Sugar Bowl in 1964 and 1965. He
has been to four bowl games as a
coach since he started his coaching
career at Alabama in 1967.

After one season as an assistant at
Alabama, Coach Sherill was hired
as freshman defensive coach at

rkansas University. He also

 "Worked with the varsity defensive

secondary. But he was soon to
move again. His next job was

under Majors at Iowa State and two |

years later he was appointed
Assistant Head Coach and defen-
sive coordinator. 1

While Sherill is busy with his
defensive chores, an ‘equally ﬁne

, coach, George Haffner, takes car of

the offense. ‘Haffner also followedd

"§"’Majors to Pitt from Iowa State

where 'he was offensive coordina-
tor. Under his diréction, last year’s
Panther offense set a school record

for total yards (3805).

Haffner’s specialty is coaching the

quarterbacks. He is well suited to

this task having been a signal-cal-
ler for both Notre Dame and the
Baltimore Colts. He greatly

George Amundson was the number

one draft pick of the Detroit Lions
two years ago. : .

Haffner is a: native of Chicago
where he attended Mt. Carmal
High and was named to the All-City
team. He moved on to Notre Dame
and earned his monogram in 1960
and 1961. He then transferred to
McNeese State and upon gradua-
tion was signed by the Colts.

Haffner didn’t get much playing
time with the Colts but was a
member of their taxisquad in 1965.

When Johnny Unitas was injured

COACH JACKIE SHERRILL

late in the season, Haffner was
activated but remained as back-up

’ quarterback. .

The next season found George
back at McNeese State where he
worked primarily with the quarter-
backs. After one year he moved to
a new job at Lake Charles High in
Louisiana and remained there for
two seasons. He met Majors at
Iowa State in 1969 and was put in

charge of quarterbacks. Two years
later he was awarded the offensive
coordinators position. Like Sher-
rill, he was too -valuable a coach to

be without, so Majors brought him"

to Pitt.

The remainder of the Pitt
coaching staff is equally qualified
to handle the complexities of the
Panther football program. Five of
the staff members followed Majors
from [own State last season, and
these others have worked with him
in the past. They know their head
coach well and know _what he

‘COACH GEORGE HAFFNER

expects from them.

Joe Avezzano is in charge of‘ the
offensive line. He has perhaps the
toughest job on the staff this

season. He got his playing
experience at.Florida State where
he lettered as a guard for three
years. From there he moved on to
the Boston Patriots ‘where he
played one season in the center
slot.

But 1967 saw Joe move on to a
new career, a coaching job at
Massillon High ' School. a The
following year he moved up to the
college coaching ranks when -he
returned to Florida State as a
graduate assistant in charge of the
freshman offense. In 1969 he got a
job at Iowa State as freshman coach
and was moved up to offensive line
coach the following year.

On the other side of the football,

season last year and should be even
«better this season.
Dyar was an exceptional athlete in
high school, earning 11 letters in
football, baskeball, track, and
baseball. He played college ball at
the University of Houston where he
lettered twice’ at guardand tackle.
He ws drafted by the Altanta
Falcons and played on the
Huntsville, AL farm team. He
began his coaching career in
Houston as a student defensive
assistant. In 1970 he moved to
Iowa State as defensive line coach.
\ The three ‘remaining ‘coaches who
followed Majors‘to Pittburgh are
Bob Roper (receivers), Keith
Schroeder and Bob Matey (junior
varsity). Roper played his college
football at Arkansas where he
lettered as a junior and- senior
receiver. H He was named All-
Southwest Conference in 1964 and
1965. Before moving to Iowa State
he held coaching jobs at. Alabama,

MEANS TO YOU 1

. . .SCHOLARSH|P AID: During schooiyear 1973-74; approximately 6,500 students
across the nation attended college on Army ROTC Scholarships. At-Pitt, one out of /
every five Army ROTC Cadets held ROTC Scholarships, during the past school year.

I These scholarships paidtheir tuition, textbooks, and all other related educational ex-

. . .FINANCIAL AID: Scholarship recipients receive a $100 per month (tax free) sub-
sistence allowanc,e. Non-scholarship students also receive a $100 per month
allowance during the ROTC advance course, normally the last two years of college.

  NEGOTIABLE EXPERIENCE: A young_mman, who has profited from. the ex-
perience afforded by ROTC and service as an officer, has a much wider knowledge
of leadership, personnel management, and general business practice. He has seen
' more, done more, and enjoyed greater responsibility. All this makes him worth more
to a prospective employer. “ " '

. . . NO OBLIGATION: During your freshman and sophomore years, ROTC is as easy
to sign up_ for —- and drop -- as any other University course, without any obligation
whatsoever. So enroll and takea good, hard look at us. THEN, objectively decide for
yourself whether or not Army ROTC will be an asset to your career plans. Remem-
ber, it costs you nothing to decide for yourself. :

The Raider defensive line will be
even tougher if Bubba Smith,
sidelined for much of 1973 with a
knee injury, can come back.

Denver Broncos _

Coach Ralston has vowed that
Denver will take revenge for
Oakland's 21;7 victory last season
against the Broncos. The triumph,
in the season’s ﬁnal game, gave
the Raider the West Division title
and left,Denver in second place.

“Although we are always inter-

‘gested in upgrading our squad,
there’s no question in our minds
that we have the people on the 1974
‘squad to go all the way,” explained
Ralston.

Another. Bronco optimist is
oldtimer Charlie Johnson, 38,‘ a
13-year pro quarterback whose
keen passing eye last season
helped Denver score 364 points—
the most in the American Confer-
ence.

Johnson, who had post-season
knee surgery, completed 184 of 346
passes for a total of 2,465 yards and
20 touchdowns. ,

* Runner Floyd Little chipped in

»carry.

Joe Dawkins gained 706
yards in 160 carries to ease the
burden on Little.

’ Johnson can throw to a pair of

All-Pro pass catchers. _Tight end
Riley Odoms led Denver with 43

catches good for 629 yards and
seven touchdowns. Deep threat
Haven Moses caught 28 passes,
eight for scores. '

Denver’s underrated offensive
line allowed the enemy to sack
Bronco passers just 27 times in
1973, one of the AFC’s best marks.

The Broncos managed to drop
opposition quarterbacks only 36
times, however, but All-Pro tackle
Paul Smith and end Lyle Alzado
with be attempting to improve the
situation.

The best Denver newcomer could
be linebacker Randy Gradishar, the
f1rst—round 1974 draft choice from
Ohio State. The All-American
rookie will seeplenty of action if his
troubled knees hold up.

Kansas City Chiefs —

The Chiefs have been around long
enough to develop the winning
habit. Last year’s 7-5-2 record tied
them for second in the AFC West
Division. It was the team’s ninth
straight winning season.

But things could get much worse
for Stram—the club’s only head
coach ever, with a record of
119-67-10—as age creeps up on the
Chiefs.

Thirty-nine-year-old Len Dawson,
for example, is listed as the top
quarterback even though he missed
eight games last season with an
assortment of nagging’ injuries.
And there is little help ‘in sight.

San Diego Chargers

New, coach Tommy Prothro, the
offense-minded former Los Angel-
es Rams boss, will have his hands
full trying to spark San Diego.

through another season. So
Prothro will go with Dan Founts,
23, a second-year pro, and Jesse
Freitas, 22, a rookie.

Fullback Cid Edwards, who has
been around for seven seasons, will
have to generate some punch. ’In
1973, Edwards rushed for 609
yards and turned in 25 receptions
for another 164 yards. '

Running back Mike Garrett rolled ’

up 467 yards in 1973; and Robert
Holmes rushed for 289 yards,
scoring seven touchdowns.

The best Charger receiver is Jerry
LeVias, who caught 30 passes last
season ‘for 526 yards. But Pettis

Norman and Garry Garrison only
turned
receptions between them.

On defense, San Diego has such A

familiar names as Deacon Jones,
Dave Costa, Lionel Aldridge and
Ron East. But there are plenty of

gaps.
