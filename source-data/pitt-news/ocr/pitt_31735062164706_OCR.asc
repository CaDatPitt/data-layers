UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Scholarship Fund  

Honors Ed. Student

The School of Education will award posthumously a
Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude, to Sherry H. Berkowitz,
at June Commencement. Miss Berkowitz died of cancer,
April 26, shortly after completing her senior year at the

University. .

The Sherry Berkowitz Memorial Fund is being estab-
lished in her honor. The Fund will give an annual award of
$50 to a qualiﬁed and needy girl in the School of Education.

Miss Berkowitz had been in
and out of the hospital ﬁve times
since becoming aware of her ail-
ment last October. She had been
stricken with melanoma, a can-
cer which spreads rapidly and
whose rate of cure is one in four,
but she continued her education
and activities at the University

until a week and a half before

her death.

At the University her activities
included Mortar Board, upper-
classwomen’s honorary; Pi Lamb-
da Theta, education honorary;
and mentor for freshman wom-
en. She was also the recipient of
the Thyrsa W. Amos Award, giv-
en to outstanding sophomore
women, and the Owens Fellow-
ship, a $1,000 award to an out-
standing education student.

Mrs. Edith Berkowitz, her
mother, was very pleased that a
fund had" been initiated in her
late daughter’s honor. “It’s a
wonderful idea,” she said. “It
will keep her name alive.”

When Miss Berkowitz became.

aware that she had a fatal ill-
ness, explained Mrs. Berkowitz,‘
she decided that she was not
ready to die and was determined
to overcome her illness _even
though she knew that the odds
were against her._

She maintained her normal
schedule which included student
teaching for which she received
an “A9: grade.

“She was very gallant,” Mrs.
Berkowitz said, “and fought to
the end.” '

The Memorial Fund is still in
the planning stage. Details con-
cerning contributions will be
available in the near future.

Chancellor
Describes
Progress

In an interview with Ken-
neth Eskey, written for Sun-
day's Pittsburgh Press, Uni-
versity Chancellor Edward
H. Litchfield discussed his
accomplishments and disap-
pointments in transforming
the University into a “great” Uni-
versity in the last 10 years.‘

The Chancellor felt that his
greatest accomplishment in the
past ten years has been improve-
ments in the University faculty,
and he cited areas of major gen-
eral improvement such as pub-
lic health, public and interna-
tional aifairs, anthropology, phil-
osophy, and physics.

The greatest difficulties in the
recent months, the Chancellor
stated, have been a signiﬁcant.

Finance Post
Centralizes
Operations

The University has recre-
ated the position of vice
chancellor for finance in an
effort to help centralize ﬁ-
nancial operations. J. T.
Hudson, Jr., former comp-
troller of the University, has been
named acting vice chancellor for
ﬁnance.

The change in . position was
described as part of a new ﬁ-
nancial structure which has re-
sulted from the University’s eco-
nomy drive.

Hudson’s newly-assumed duties
were formerly those of Lawrence
L. Monnett, Jr., vice chancellor
for business affairs. Monnettwill
remain in charge of the‘ physical
plant,’ Auxiliary Enterprises and

office services and will continue’
’ as president of the Oakland Cor-

poration.

Hudson left the University in
1964 after having served as comp-
troller and assistant treasurer for
ﬁve years.

The secondiphase will include
a live confrontation between Mc-
George Bundy, special presiden-
tial assistant, and his academic
critics. The last phase will fea-

can participate.

Veep Requests RetumiiSpee-chi   

._By,FRED N. FRANK

When some speakers come
to the University they either
have to be offered a good
salary or be convinced by
their agent that it Wﬂl be
a smart thing to do before
they will ‘condescend to address a
college audience.

But not Vice-President Hubert
Humphrey. Vice-President Hum-
phrey had apparently mentioned
to former Pennsylvania Governor
David L. Lawrence that he had
enjoyed speaking at the Univer-
sity during the election cam-
paign and he expressed a desire
to Lawrence to speak again at
the University.

Gov. Lawrence and the Chan-
cellor’s office arranged that the
Vice-President would address the
University May 13 at 4 p.m. ' in
the Stephen Foster Memorial Au-
ditorium. '

VILE-PRESIDENT Hubert Humphrey, seen here addressing a crowd

on the Cathedral lawn last fall, will return to the University May 13.
His Midday Series speech, at 4 p.m. in Stephen Foster Memorial Au-
ditorium, precedes a Democratic fund raising dinner.

Teachers and Students 

To Attend iNat’l. Viet

Protest Demonstration

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS ._ .

With 75 leading American scholars‘ endorsing it, a na- j .
tional student-faculty committee has announced plans for a 
teach-in May 15 to protest US. policy in Viet Nam. Dr.  
Robert G. Colodny, associate professor of history at the 
University, is presently arranging to hear a national tele-
phone hook-up of the teach-in from Washington, D.C.

The teach-in will consist of three phases. The ﬁrst 
feature speakers discussing the causes of the Viet Nam war
and the problems of current policy and possible alternatives.
They will also consider the role of the intellectual in oppos-

and spreading throughout the

country. The April 17 Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)

march in Washington marked the H

second step.
Plans for this national teach-in

were formulated by Michigan fac-A 

ulty. following the successful one,

March 24, in Ann Arbor, Michi-‘ P

gan. The group has set up local

hook-ups to the national teach-in ‘

telephone lines. This communi-
cation net was reportedly pro-
vided byia large individual dona-
tion.

The movement does not have  ; -

a single policy on the war. Rath-
er] its members generally agree

bombings in North ’ Viet Nam-=-~—
should stop and - negotiations ‘ "

should begin in order to end the
civil war in which they feel the

U.S. is trapped. They fear that '

the Viet Nam conﬂict is growing
into a major conﬂict—possibly
with China. '
University professors express-
ed general concern with the sit-
uation in Viet Nam. History in-

structor Allen Pollack presented  .

. the prevailing opinion: “I think

we should do everything. possi-
ble to get our troops out of North
Viet Nam and the Dominican
Republic, as well.”

Other professors were less clear
as to what should be done in
Viet Nam, butwere certain that
the present policy needed chang-
ing. Past teach-ins gained much
comment also. Pollack deemed
the all-day lecture an “excellent
idea. This can be a very valuable
instructional tool. I hope there
will be one here.” ~

Girl Killed, Two Students
Injured in Auto Accident

Three University students were injured, one fatally, in
an automobile accident last Saturday. Two of them, Charles
Trowbridge, 18,‘ of Glenshaw, Pa. and Roger Cox, 20, of
Shaker Heights, Ohio, are freshmen in the School of Liberal

Arts.

Patricia F‘rederick,‘18, of Allison Park, Pa. -died in the

accident. She was a night stu-
dent at the University, who work-
ed during the week at full-time
child care, in Fox Chapel, Pa.
The accident took place near
the Point as Cox sped at 60 mph
from the Fort Pitt Bridge. The
car swerved out of control at the
barrier to the Fort Duquesne
Bridge, jumped a curb, overturn-

‘ ,facts‘gthat people, including alum-
ni, “are apathetic to the future
of the University and that the
University has lost contact with

 Questioned about the Universi-

 all private institutions are
continuing to raise their tuition,
_and any raise is done reluctantly.
The Chancellor noted that more
and more higher education‘ is
‘becoming publicly ﬁnanced. The
University could beneﬁt greatly
if it were given corporate sup-
port, such as that given to Case
Institute of Technology in Cleve-
land, Ohio.

The Chancellor was skeptical
..about the University becoming a
state university to solve its mon-
ey problebms. He cited the lack
of signiﬁcant improvements by
Temple University, which .four

Recent events have caused speculation as to whether the word
alumni should be redeﬁned at this university. The traditional definition
includes such characteristics as returning for homecoming, showing pride
. and interest in their school, and helping the institution ﬁnancially. The '
first may be true of Univ. alumni, but the later two are being questioned.

Mt. Lebanon was a disappointing experience both from the stand-
point of attendance and the questions asked. N aivete seemed to be a domi-
nant feature in most of the questions raised. This was unfortunate be-
-cause it pointed out the lack of interest in the school by those alumni who
showed up. How well-informed those are that didn’t is purelyza matter for

speculation. A

What happened at Mt. Lebanon may only be an isolated case, but
many of the alumni doubt that the University is in- any financial
trouble or if they concede it is, it can be attributed to Chancellor Litchﬁeld
and his wild spending. Alunmi that hold these views, hopefully no more
than a small minority, are either deluding themselves or haven’t read a

Editorial: Payment Du efor Greatness         
‘A The changes wrought in the last ten years are the reason why this
University has been rising steadily in the academic world. But as this

expansion has continued, money has not been forthcoming from expected
areas——a major one being alumni. '

A few years ago the Board of Trustees roughly estimated that by
this time the University should have received about a $125 million dollars
from our graduates. This ﬁgure was never even approached.

The question is not really whether the alumni will give or how much.
It is more basic than that. It is do the alumni really care? Or did they
only attend the University to pick up a trade? Judging by some of their
reactions, it’s almost disgraceful to have graduated from this institution.

This may not be the case but very few barometers of alumni opinion
seem to be pointing in the opposite. direction. It_is time that the alumni of
this great University come out of their lethargy and see what their Univer-
sity has accomplished. They should recognize that if this progress is to con-
tinue, help is needed—-their help. Many alumni have given regularly to
this University, but it’s time we heard from all those who have remained

|  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

,‘Rights’ Worker
Urges Unity

Editor, The Pitt News:

At the end of last month those
of us who Went to Selma and to
Montgomery were again in the
position of trying to explain why
we made such a trip.

The answers, particularly the
multiplicity of answers, to this
question will be important; for
what happened in Alabama is a
national experience, and if it is
to be understood meaningfully,

then it must be understood in

terms of diversity, rather than i

in terms of a‘ single pattern of
reaction.

Yet the growing number of in_.

dividual stories concerning ‘what ‘

happened in Alabama do pose a
threat; for they tend to obscure
the fact thatthe role which most
of us played in the South was
signiﬁcant only in terms of the
larger forces we served. Without
these forces and without our
pushing with them in the right
way, our efforts would have been
for nothing.

To interpret events in Alabama
—-as so many newspaper inter-

. views have'——in the light of pure-

ly individual encounters-—is thus
to sacriﬁce truth for literary ap-
peal: but worse than that, it is
‘to create a‘ divisive gulf between
those who went South and those
of goqd'will‘_j who stayed North.
Nothing could ‘be more unfortu.
nate.. .

IfvPettus Bridge and Selma are
to become the Concord of the
Civil Rights movement, then what
happened there must be under-
stood not simply by those who
marched along Route 80 but by

those who never saw it.

This point cannot be too strong-
1y emphasized. The thinking of
many whites in Alabama is that
once. the excitement of the last
few weeks is over, life in the
Black Belt can return to its usual
pattern without much’ worry
about the future. It would be sad
if Civil Rights workers, by insis-
ting on the primary of their own
experiences, helped allow this
prophecy to come true.

Changing Selma will be a long
and difficult process. The money
and the people necessary for such
a venture will have to come from
many sources, and for those of
us associated with the Alabama
movement to feel that only one
kind of‘ totally committed per-
son is necessary is not only prag-
matically foolish, it is the most
dangerous form of moral conceit.

A nation of civilized people
must be able to learn vicariously
and from events that are not al-
ways tragic.

To understand life only through
the death of a Jimmie Lee Jack-
son or a James Reeb is ultimately
to indulge in spiritual "cannibal-
ism. It is also to mistake the
Civil Rights movement itself; to
understand it only as .a demand
for Negro rights, when in fact it
is the rhetorical questioning of

-a society in which the differ-

ences between what might be and

what is seem more destined than

ever for destruction.

Faculty in Demand

  ~Money Not to 

\
By Donald Friedman

There is probably no one who. could deny that the Uni-
versity is in serious ﬁnancial trouble. On the other hand,
it is very possible that too much‘ stress is placed on the
ﬁnancial situation, which is therefore being blamed for par-
tially, and even._.completely, unrelated occurrences.

The most recent example of this “debt-status syn-
drome” is the ﬂurry over the resignations of ﬁve of the
University’s top professors, which some people have con-
nected with the ﬁnancial situation. Not only are these resig-
, nations not a result of the ﬁnancial situa-
tion, they may even portend some good for
the University. ' ’

IN AN ARTICLE in the April 28 issue
of The Pitt News, Dean of the Faculties
Stanton Crawford pointed out that a ten
per cent faculty turnover is to be expected.

While this is one factor to be considered,
there is another which may be even more
important and which will cause an abnorm-
ally high turnover. When Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld came here in 1956 he determined,
among other things, to improve the quality of the faculty.
To carry out this plan, he brought in many fine young peo-
ple from other universities. In some cases whole depart-
ments were bought. ,

Although a university hates to see a good man (or de-
partment) leave, the Chancellor’s purchases were not viewed
as anything out of the ordinary. It~is standard procedure
for an ambitious professor to change positions when offered
higher pay, higher academic status, or both. It is also very

  

common to take a higher position with a smaller or lower.

ranking university.

An example of this type of move is Dr. William Boyer,
who is an associate professor here, but who will become a
full professor and head of the‘ department with a higher

- salary at Kansas State University. Although Kansas State

does not rank academically with the University, the move
is definitely in Dr. Boyer’s ‘best interests. .

SINCE OTHER SCHOOLS are as interested in improve-
ments as the University, they too are looking for good men
to ﬁll openings on their faculties. The fact that they are
beginning to take them from the University will raise the
turnover rate here and is a clear sign of the respect with
which the faculty here is viewed by other schools. Members
of the University’s faculty are now prime commodities in
the academic marketplace.

The obvious question at this point is whether the Uni-
versity, if it were not in ﬁnancial difficulty, could offer
these people enough money to make them stay here. The,
facts of the matter indicate a negative response. The faculty
salary increase which had come to be expected annually, and
which was withheld this year, comprised only a small frac-
tion of a professor’s salary.

One of the professors who is leaving, however, is being
offered 40 per cent more than he received here. Another
has been offered close to 50 per cent more than his present
salary and is accepting a deal which includes every fourth
year off at two-thirds full pay. The University could not
match offers like that even if it were ﬁnancially sound.

The unusually high number of top faculty members.
leaving and the offers which they are receiving show that
their moves are primarily unrelated to the University’s
ﬁnancial condition, and that the University’s faculty is being!

Celebration  M...~:.s  

Israeli Independence

Israel’s Independence Day
will be celebrated this Sat-
urday at 8:30 p.m. in the
Student Union Ballroom,
with a program sponsored by
the local Israel Student Or-
ganization. -

The program will consist of
guest speaker, ex-General Doron,
an Israeli folk dancing group.
and a ﬁlm on Israel; Israeli food
will be served after the program.

Israeli Independence Day, May
15, commemorates 17 years of
progress for Israel. Dr. Morde-

Viet Teach-in

(Continued from Page 1)
tant professor of history, also
felt that “teach-ins have proved

effective in raising the question '

of U. S. policy in Viet Nam in .a
rather natural way for the in-
tellectual community.

“A teach-in at Pitt would be
successful. More large-scale ques-
tioning on this policy could be
extremely valuable for the fac-
ulty as well as for the students.”

Dr. Richard Cottam, associate
professor of political science, did
not think that “teach-ins are par-
ticularly eﬁective as educational
tools or in arousing public opin-
ion; they are powerful, however,
in Washington.” He considered
the wide participation in teach-
ins an expression of the decreas-
ing apathy of the students. _

Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associate
professor of sociology, also ex-

pressed concern with public re-

action to student demonstrations.
“I think regardless of anything
students or professors do in the
way of protests there are always
people regarding them as reac-
tionaries.”

Dr. Berkowitz favored the
teach-in. The main advantage of
this form of demonstration would
be exposing the more conserva-
tive students to the world; this
would be an unmitigated bless-
ing. “Teach-ins are not ‘outlets

for frustration,” he concluded.

“The standard outlet for that is

professional knowledge and tech-
nical training which Israel needs.

Mitters Play Five Games

ByTOM SACKS

In the next six days the
baseball team has seven
games and several rainy
days might provide them
their -best chance to extend
their undefeated record.

The 9-0 squad‘ faces West-
minster tomorrow at Leech
Farm Hospital field, at 3:30
p.m. Saturday they travel to
Slippery Rock for a doublehead-
er and Sunday they have two
games at Penn State. Next week
they play California State, West
Virginia and Bucknell.

“This weekend could be -term-
ed the crisis of the season,” said
coach Bobby Lewis.

Lewis jokingly referred to send-
ing down to his farm club in Day-
tona, Florida, for some pitching
help. He might be just that des-



 ‘In nine games, pitchers Dave

Blyshak, Lee Brueckel, Paul Hel-
sel and Don Stock have had no
help from the bull pen. Seven
games were shutouts, and the
foursome allowed only 18 hits
and three runs.

The three pitchers —- Carmen

‘Bordogan, Bob Sirka and Frank

Monaco—who have been invol-
untarily inactive will probably
pitch this weekend.

“Any three could start a game,”
said Lewis. “If things get tough
I wouldn’t hesitate to use any
of them. I’ll be playing it by ear.
In this game you c‘an’t plan too
far ahead.”

Lewis will be searching his
bench just as much as his bull
pen. The back-to-back double-
headers require at least one man
depth in every position. Right-
ﬁelder Bill Bodle will probably
move to catcher, backing up de
fensive act Doug Chambers.

The last time the baseball team
had such a successful start was
in 1963,when it won 12 straight
before losing to West Virginia,
1-0. Theseason record that year
was 18-3.

Irony plagued the team that
year. Despite their superior rec-
ord, Penn State received priority
in gaining an NCAA bid. The Nit-
tany Lions were scheduled to
play here the weekend before

bids, but were rained out.

Lewis insists that the winning
streak and overcrowded schedule
will not atfect the team’s mental
attitude. “The way the fellows
have been playing I don’t think
so,” he said.

“They haven’t been making
mental errors. In this game you’re
kept so busy you don’t have time
too look ahead. Each batter is
a potential danger.”

Penn State split with Syra-
cuse last week in a slugfest, 12-7,
8-11. The mitters downed the
Orangemen earlier, 1-0, 2-1. Prior
to the Syracuse doubleheader
State had committed 29 errors
in six games.

Two similar squads meet
Saturday w-hen the track
team travels to Hamilton
New York for a dual meet
with Colgate.

'1‘-he tracksters attempt to
even their record at 3-3 fol-
lowing the “Big Four” meet
at Morgatntown last week,
where they lost to Penn
State and West Virginia,
while defeating Syracuse.
The meet features several head-
to-head battles between key men
on each squad. -

“Sammie” Amukun is Co1gate’s
best lperformer, and he faces Bill
De1Vecch.io in both the 100-yard
dash and the 220-yard dash.
Both men ran the 100 in 9.6 sec-
onds in separate meets last week.

' Another close contest looms be-
tween Luddy Hayden and Dick
Johnston in the hurdling events.
Johnson won the 440-yard hurdle

BILL DELVEOCEIO
Sets Record in 220 Dash

The track men came out of the
quadrangular meet in question-
able physical shape with Doug
Doben injuring a-hamstring mus-
cle. It will be several days before
Rees will know how effective
Luddy Hayden and Fred Poellnitz
will be.

DelVecchio aims for more rec-
ord breaking times at Colgate. He
set Mountaineer Stadium records
in the 220-yard dash and in a
quarter mile leg of the mile re-
lay last week. He alsoset a new
University 100-yard dash mark
