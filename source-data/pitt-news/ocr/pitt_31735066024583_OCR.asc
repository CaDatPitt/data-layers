Black studies Chair Brenda Berrian said
the department is “trying to move ahead”
past longstanding internal turmoil
investigated by a Faculty of Arts and
Sciences committee last term.

The conﬂicts in black studies come
partially from a -“need to professionalize
the department,” which the black studies
faculty realizes is inferior to most other
areas of FAS, said committee chair and
history Professor Harold Sims.

“There are people who want to [improve
black studies] as quickly as possible and at
whatever personal cost, and people who
disagree with those methods,” Sims said.
“What you are seeing now is the fallout”
from this ideological struggle, according
to Sims.

Last week senior black studies instructor
Rollo Turner was suspended because he
allegedly violated his contract by refusing
to teach a third class. “There is a clear
dispute on how to read the contract,” said
Katheryn Linduff, associate dean for
academic affairs.

Berrian said the department is concerned
with strengthening the curriculum and
“moving ahead as a group” to resolve any
problems.

“The people who are running the
department are very professional,” Sims
said. “I think things are going to work out
well. I have a positive view of the future
for the department.”

. The creation of the committee was
prompted partly by charges Professor
Emmanuel Anise had made against another
instructor in the department, according to
Turner. But the committee found these.

The new executive boards of Pitt’s
Panhellenic Association and Inter-
Fraternity Council were installed in a brief
ceremony held in the William Pitt Union
yesterday evening. .

The installation of the new executive
boards was preceded by a short address
by exiting Panhel President Sandra Kramer.

“The past year can be characterized by
strong leadership and diligence,” Kramer
said. Among last year’s high points,
according to Kramer, were an increased
rush enrollment and “a revision of social
policies.” One such policy would be the
“kegless party” policy adopted by. the IFC
last term. ~  '

Former Internal Vice-President Andy

accusations of inappropriate behavior to
be groundless, Sims said.

“We found the charges have no basis. I
am hesitant to comment beyond that,”
Sims said. He said the committee,
comprised of four full professors and one
dean, made recommendations to the
department about how black studies could
run more smoothly.

Parts of the report were rejected by the
entire black studies faculty, according to
Turner. “The entire investigation has been
discredited,” he said.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said there are
“inaccuracies in the report which we’re
trying to rectify.” ’

Koehler said he did not know when the
hearing on Turner’s suspension would be
held. But Turner’s firing/was not “a sudden,
unjustified, outrageous act,” according to
Sims.

    

Feldman spoke in place of former board
President Darin McMullen, who graduated
at the end of the fall term. In his address,
Feldman said the IFC was able to increase
rush enrollment with the help of its sponsor,
Pepsi. Feldman also hoped that the IFC
would continue to “keep Pitt Greeks at the
forefront of the Hellenic world.”

The opening words were followed by a
short inauguration ceremony, in which
Gregory Rea and Lori White, the new
presidents, swore to uphold the
constitutions of their respective
organizations and to respect the rights of
each house they represent. As their first
acts of office, both presidents swore in the
other four members of their boards.

Following the induction ceremonies,
the newly installed presidents offered their

Turner himself said he thinks he‘ was

than his refusal to teach a third class which

not teaching is the tip of the iceberg.”

Anise has said a power struggle has _ _'

been raging in the department for years
between former chair Dennis Brutus and
Berrian. «

Tensions also have ﬂared because black
studies departments generally require their,
faculty to be activists, Sims said, and Pitt’s
department is no different.

Conflict is heightened because black

studies faculty members are “obligated to ’

be active in the community,” which places

a “special burden” of extra work upon

them,” according to Sims. “I” don't know

Safety task force considers.

By Manuel Hernandez
For T be Pitt News

The Presidential Task Force on
Campus Safety is reviewing the
possibility of starting an escort service
for students or linking the transportation
systems of local universities.

The task force's transportation
subcommittee is looking into joining
the transportation systems of Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon University and
Duquesne University.

“With a better transportation network
involving all three universities, it would
be much easier to transport students to

linking university shuttles

, areas that might not be currently covered

by Pitt’s transportation system,” said
Sgt. Charles Grier of Pitt’s campus police.

The escort service subcommittee is
researching the feasibility of establishing-
an student—run Oakland escort service,
which would provide an escort to
anyone who re quests to be accompanied
to a designated location.

Public safety review subcommittee
members intend to determine the best
way to deploy campus police officers
and make recommendations for
changes. The subcommittee -is also

State abortion law moves groups to action

 

By Suzann Gries
staff Writer

Pennsylvania would be one of
the states most likely to ban
abortion if Roe vs. Wade is
overturned, according to a survey
conducted by the National
Abortion Rights Action League.

University Democrats President
Joel Leonard said, “As a resident
of Pennsylvania, I’m personally
ashamed that this state would do
this.”

Pennsylvania law states that a
young woman under 18 must
receive permission from one of

her parents before having ans

abortion. It also stipulates that a
woman wait 24 hours before
getting an abortion.

A married woman formerly also
had to obtain her husband’s
consent, but a federal appeals
court overruled that statute.

Leonard said that the University
Democrats assumes a pro-choice
stance.

“I can only speculate on.why—
Pennsylvania would be among
those states to ban abortion,” he
said.

“Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
are centers for Democratic voters.
Unfortunately, the rest of the state
is pretty heavily Republican and
therefore more conservative and
more anti-choice,” Leonard
said.

President of Students for Life
Melissa Collins said,
“Pennsylvania has stepped
forward as a pro-life state because
the people in the state realize the
extreme violence that happens
when an abortion is
performed.”

Basically, I don’t understand how people
say we have rights in a country where we
don’t even have rights over our own bodies

-Gina McFarlin

Students for Life, along with
other pro-life groups, marches in
front of Women’s Health Services
at the Fulton Building once a
month in a protest called “Project
Multitude.”

A national pro—life march will
take place in Washington, D.C.,
on Jan. 22, the day of the Roe vs.
Wade ruling in 1973.

“I believe abortion is wrong
because it is the taking of a
human life. Just because you don’t
see it doesn’t mean it’s not wrong.
I believe in choice but choice
before conception,” Collins
said.

Co—president of the Campus
Women’s Organization Gina
McFarlin said abortion is an
individual choice, not a religious
one. 1

“Basically, I don’t understand
how people say we have rights in
a country where we don’t even
have rights over our own bodies,”
McFarlin said.

The CWO distributes pro-
choice literature, and some
members do volunteer work for
NARAL.

The National Organization for
Women is co—sponsoring a pro-
choice march on April 5 in
Washington, D.C.

According to co—president Chris
Helsel, the CWO’s main focus is
the issue of abortion.
“Unfortunately, abortion is one
of the fundamental issues of any
feminist group.” I

Helsel said politicians like
David Duke and Steven Freind
base everything they say on
ignorance and fear.

“People have got to ‘stop
buying into their arguments,” she
said:

McFarlin said the reason
Pennsylvania would outlaw
abortion is because “it’s a more
middle-class area. Even a lot of
Democrats who are usually more
pro-choice are older and more
conservative.”

Pitt College Republicans Public
Relations Director Jonathan
Kurland said, “As an individual I
consider myself pro-life. The party
platform is the anti~abortion
stance.”

According to Kurland, the
Supreme Court did not have the
right to -make the decision about
abortion because the
matter should be left to state
legislators.

Collins said she is “very, very
optimistic that Roe vs. Wade will
be overturned.”

Abortion fund established       I I

By Suzann Gries
Staff Writer

Women’s Health Services has established the Leah Sayles
Fund in honor of its founding executive director, Leah Sayles.

Sayles, who died last November from a brain tumor, was a »

leader in the movement to legalize abortion in the United
States. .

Mary Lipscomb Litman from the WHS said, “Leah was an
incredible woman. She felt that the knowledge to exercise
choice is the most important thing.”

The money in the fund will be used to provide access for a
woman to have a safe abortion, or counseling if abortion
becomes illegal, according to Litman.

Spokesperson for the fund Patricia Miller said, “We want to
keep the ﬂame alive even under adverse conditions. We know
Leah would approve.”

The Supreme Court legalized abortion by its ruling on Roe vs.
Wade on January 22, 1973. Sayles began Women’s Health
Services a few months later on April 11, 1973, and served as its
executive director for 11 years.

Many women died due to illegal abortions prior to 1973, and
Sayles’ determination helped to overcome this, according to
Litman.

“She had the vision and knowledge, and she was an
inspiration. It was her strength and her vision that provided
women with the choice to have an abortion,” Litman said.

The WI-IS is prepared if Roe vs.Wade is overturned. It will
continue to uphold Sayles’ tradition of counseling women to
make proper decisions, according to Litman. I

“What we want to do is build up our clinics and continue to
stay open and to have pro-choice legislators that will work for
the passage of the Freedom of Choice Act, which will effectively
make Roe vs. Wade the law of the land,” Litman said.

For The Pitt News

Biology professor Iain
Campbell wants to give

.undergraduates the education

they deserve.

“It's my responsibility to bring
those with a defective academic
background up to their intellectual
level," Campbell said.

Campbell, a citizen of the
United Kingdom, has been in the
United States teaching at the
University of Pittsburgh since
1965.

Campbell started teaching
biology in 1980 to more or less to
prove a point.

Although he does not hold a
degree in biology, “a good teacher
can teach anything,” Campbell
said.

Since 1980, Campbell has

to help undergraduates

grown into a self-described fighter
for justice for the undergraduate.
Going against the beliefs of many
members of the department,
Campbell said he believes more
should be done to help out
underclass students.

The university budget and state
aid should be split between
undergraduates and graduates,
he said.

Campbell’s conviction is
evident through his in-class
performance; along with teaching
a lecture, he also teaches his
recitation sections.

Although other faculty
members think he is crazy, if a
student comes to take his class,
then he is going to teach it,
Campbell said.

He said he takes’ complete
responsibility for his students. “If
they don’t know biology, then it’s

my fault.”

Campbell also works for the
Department of Energy converting
fossil fuels into useful. materials
and now works on President
Bush’s America 2000.

The America 2000 program is
designed to further education by
improving the system, building
new schools and updating the
educational work force.

All the degrees in the world do
not make a good teacher —— the
desire to teach does, he said.

By working with America 2000,
Campbell hopes to ﬁnd teachers
with the spark to improve the
state of education.

As a member of the biology
department, he has taught
Biochemistry and Nutrition for
graduates, and teaches Biology
15 and 16 along with
Microbiology.

BiGALA supports
removal of ROTC

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance is “not against the
university or ROTC” in its protest against the Department of
Defense policy which prohibits homosexuals from participating
in the military.

Pitt President J. Dennis O'Connor has said he will soon
comment on the University Senate committee recommendation
to remove ROTC from the university by 1997 if the DOD policy
continues.

At a presidential forum last month President O'Connor said
he would have a final answer after Jan. 1 on the ROTC
question.

BiGALA member Lori _Paluti said the group is opposed to
ROTC on campus because the DOD policy violates the
university rule prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.

Excluding gays, lesbians and bisexuals from the military
condones prejudice by the U.S. government, she said.

“The U.S. president defends this policy, and it makes you

think, ‘Where does this country stand in regard to gay and

lesbian rights?” Paluti said.

A strong anti-homosexual reaction among military personnel
is one justification the DOD has listed for excluding homosexuals
from the armed services.

Some officers have argued that homosexuals in leadership
positionswould not be respected and might even be assaulted
by other soldiers.

“The rationale [for the DOD policy] is because people in the
military are homophobic. That's usinghomophobia to justify
homophobia,” Kinavey said. '

Kinavey compared the exclusion of homosexuals from the
military to former defense policies excluding blacks and
women.

“Instead of addressing the problem of racism and
homophobia, it’s just kicking the ‘undesirables’ out,” he
said.

Government studies have shown that gay and lesbian

military personnel are “as good as or better than heterosexuals,”

Kinavey said. a  . .
“Their own findings don’t even support this policy,” Kinavey
said. A '

According to Kinavey, the DOD policy has already hurt the
military because it costs money to dismiss hundreds of
homosexuals each year.

The military also loses some of its best talent, Kinavey
said.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome puzzling

By Kim Palmiero
Staﬂ“ Writer

Former Pitt student Darlene Moore thought
she had the flu when she woke up one day with
a fever and aching muscles.

But when her symptoms continued, she
knew what she had was more serious than the
flu. *

Moore went to Student Health inJanuary 1990,
complaining of a fever, aching muscles,
swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and a sore
throat.

She continued going to Student Health
periodically until she graduated in April 1991.

But Moore still could not find an answer to her

“problem. .

Doctors at Student Health couldn’t figure
out what was exactly wrong with Moore, telling
her that it was probably depression or the
flu.

When Moore graduated, she discovered she
has a disease which often goes undiagnosed
because no one really knows what causes it:
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

“I didn’t have the health insurance to pay for
a doctor,” Mooresaid. “At one time [Student
Health] would just’ tell me to take Advil, and that
I needed a rest or that I was depressed. I was
looking for an answer, and I wanted to believe
them.”

Moore was diagnosed as having Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome by a doctor in Mt.
Lebanon. V

Although she has not taken any medicine, she
said she feels better than she did last year.

“Now I feel as though I am in recovery. I feel
tired, but there is this push that gets you through,”
Moore said.

Moore, who graduated magna cum laude with
a degree in child development, said she feels
lucky.

“A lot of people lose their jobs, but this has not
happened to me‘. I've been able to keep up my
responsibilities.” -

Dr. Frederick Rubin, who works in internal
medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, explained
some of the problems associated with identifying
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: “We don’t know the
cause, and therefore we don’t know how to treat
it.”

“We have no way to test for Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome,” ‘Rubin said.

“The way we have to diagnose Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome is to exclude all other diseases which
may have the same symptoms. There are as
many as 20 to 40 different things that must be
excluded first.”

Instead of a test, physicians must rely on a set
of criteria established by experts at the
Centers for Disease Control, according to
Rubin.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome usually strikes
people who are between 20 and 40, Rubin
said; A . ,

There isn’t a link between Chronic Fatigue and
Epstein-Barr Virus, Rubin said.

Ninety-five to 99 percentvof people who have
Epstein-Barr don’t have Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome. .

“The best guess is that Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome is a virus that we don’tknow much
about,” he said.

It’s not necessarily a new disease, but it is a
newly recognized disease, according to
Rubin.

“I think it’s still safe to call it a mystery,” he
said.

are needed.

The task force will soon make
recommendations to Pitt President
J. Dennis O’Connor, according to
committee members.

“Most activity in the task force
is just getting underway since we
began the new semester. We
should have full recommend-
ations to Dr. O’Connor before
the term is over,” said Student
Government Board member and
escort service subcommittee chair
Jacob Brody.

The task force was created after
a student was sexual assaulted in

Forbes Quad on Nov. 5. The

“This is a prime example of Dr.

commitment to campus safety.
Hopefully incidents such at the

The committee plans to hold

student awareness and elicit
suggestions.

“Hopefully we can build on the
students’ concern from last term.
We also hope students stay
concerned, and if we get students

Researchers test new
appltcationfor FK50

By Kathy Krniecik
Stat)“ Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center recently
announced it will begin testing
the anti-rejection drug FKSO6 to
treat patients with inﬂammatory
bowel diseases.

The use of FK506 to prevent
organ rejection in transplant
patients was first developed at
the University of Pittsburgh by

. Dr. Thomas Starzl, director of

Pitt’s Transplantation Institute,
and a Japanese pharmaceutical
company.

The drug’s effects on liver-
transplant patients led doctors to
believe it could also benefit IBD
patients.

Dr.James C. Reynolds, principal
investigator of the study and chief
of gastroenterology at the medical
center said, “We suspected FK506
to have some benefit on IBD
patients when we noticed
improvement in liver—transplant
patients with these conditions
who were taking FK506 and in
patients with other autoimmune
diseases of the skin, pyoderma
gangrenosum, who responded
to FK506 treatment for both the
skin disease and the IBD
complications.”

IBD is a term used to refer to
two severe digestive disorders:
ulcerative colitis and Chrohn’s

 

Disease.

and weight loss. .

Little is known about the cause ' 0 1

of IBD, except that it is caused 
an attack by the immune

system on the digestive system in ..

Chrohn’s and the large 
intestine in ulcerative I 
colitis.

The role of FK 506 is to suppress: ; V
the body’s immune system, which‘
helps to manage the intensity of

the symptoms.

Pitt alumnus Dr. Mark
Musmanno considers himself to
be very lucky.

In August last year Musmanno,"

a practicing physician in

Jacksonville, Fla., was ﬁnishing

up his four—year obligation to the
Navy with one month remaining.
Then he received a call that
told him he was shipping out to
the Persian Gulf. Musmanno
knew this had to be a mistake.
Musmanno quickly explained
that he had only one month

remaining on his obligation to
the Navy, which enabled him to
remain in Jacksonville for two
more months before moving to

-~ Pittsburgh.

Musmanno was very relieved
when he found out he didn’t
have to go to the gulf.

“It was a very stressful time
then because I had a job to come
to and I bought a house in

' Pittsburgh to move my family to

.. and all of sudden there was
this potential that I wouldn’t be
able to get out of the Navy,”
Musmanno said.

Originally from McKees Rocks,

located just outside ofPittsburgh,
Musmanno moved to Harrisburg
in the early ’60s because his father
worked for the state as a deputy
secretary of state’ education.
Musmanno said that his interest
in medicine began during his
high school years in Harrisburg.

“I just had a basic interest in the
sciences and humanities, and I
simply combined the two of them
in high school,” Musmanno said.

After graduating high school in
1973, Musmanno came to Pitt to
become a doctor. Unlike many
undergraduate students,
Musmanno had his goal in mind

throughout his undergraduate
years, during which he was
involved with the University Glee
Club, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
and various honor societies.

Musmanno graduated from Pitt
in 1977 with a degree in
biochemistry and was looking to
continue his medical education
at Pitt for a couple of reasons.

“The medical school had a good
reputation, and I knew the area
and liked Pittsburgh and wanted
to stay. There were a couple of
other medical schools, but I chose
Pitt to stay more home-based,”
Musmanno said.

Most importantly, he saw a
great opportunity to stay at Pitt
by entering a program that
involved the military and the Pitt
medical-school. -

Under this program the ‘Navy
would pay the tuition for his four
years at medical school in
exchange for four years of medical * -
service to the Navy. " ,  

“I was commissionedinto _the..
Navy right after graduation 

service in which training did not
count,” Musmanno said: 

During his time at Pitt’s medical
school, Musmanno became

interested in becoming a urologyj “‘
specialist for a number of reasons. ' ‘

“I always liked working‘ with-
my hands, and that is why I chose
the surgery specialty. It has a
variety of applications for the
large amount of office practice,
and the surgery ranges from
simple minor surgery to complex
cancer surgery,” Musmanno said.

Coming out of Pitt medical
school in 1981, Musmanno spent
the first year of his four—year tour
as a medical officer on a Navy
ship in 1982.

THE PI'I’I‘ NEWS, Wednesday, January 15, 1992 _

W/ar experience leaves Pitt alumnus feeling lucky

“I was the medical officer on
the U.S.S. Duluth, which was an
amphibious ship, and what we

, did was carry the Marines with

their assault equipment. In
retrospect, it was great. There is
never any other way I could have
to do that kind of traveling,”
Musmanno said. A
Musmanno said that serving on
the ship took him to locations
such as Hawaii, the Phillippines

and Thailand during the ship’s
_training maneuvers. Musmanno’s ’

services on the ship earned him a
Navy commendation medal.
After completing his time on
the U.S.S. Duluth, Musmanno
entered residency at a San Diego
hospital, where he spent his next
four years. But the time spent in

_» residency did not count toward

the three remaining years he owed

I the Navy.

 Musmanno ﬁnished those three

years, by moving to Jacksonville

goals for the coming year.

“[The IFC] has become too
much of a policing agency,” Rea
said. In an interview afterwards,
Rea said that many of the council’s
meetings focused on the “internal
workings” of the IFC, including
alcohol and rush policies.

“The fraternities can regulate
themselves,” Rea said.

Rea said that when the IFC
performs the function of
watchdog over Pitt’s fraternities,
it loses the respect of the
members.

“When the fraternities need
help, they no longer come to us.
Often times, fraternities don’teven
send their presidents and vice
presidents [to IFC meetings]. What
we need at the meetings are the
people who command the most
respect from their fraternities,”
Rea said. “That way, we can
represent the whole system and
accomplish our goals together.”

Rea said the IFC has to return to
a grass-roots level and perform
as a service organization that can
“enhance the quality of Greek
life.”

New Panhellenic President Lori
White said that this year is “a
fantastic time for Greeks at the
University of Pittsburgh.” White
said that while membership in
Greek houses at other universities
plummets, membership in Pitt
fraternities and sororities
continues to rise.

In her inaugural speech, White
stressed involvement by all.

“We are a reflection of you,”
White said. “We must work
together to set the groundwork
for those who will follow us at
the University of Pittsburgh.

“We have a pretty strong
organization. I just hope that our
success continues,” White said
after the ceremony.

“I’d like to get our executive
board to work together as a unit
and also with the IFC,” she said.

White also reiterated the need
for more involvement on the part
of individuals.

“We need more involvement
from other fraternity and sorority
members. We are their board.

“I’d like to institute programs
that they’d like to see,” White
said. White wants to see the
creation of a safety council and
greater involvement by and
interaction between the judicial
boards of both coalitions.

“Because most social events
are sponsored by fraternities, they
carry the brunt of the liability
[should socializing go awry]. We
should share that responsibility,”
White said.

Each board, which functions as
a governance group for its inter-
house organization, has five seats.
The president of the board
handles the administrative
burdens of the organization.
There are two vice-presidential
posts within each organization
—— that of the internal vice-
president, who handles rush and
other related activities, and that
of the external vice president,
who oversees the chairs of
committees within each coalition
of houses.

The holders of two other offices,
treasurer and secretary, handle
financial business and
communications, respectively.

The new president of the
Panhellenic Association is Lori
White. The Panhellenic
Association’s new internal vice-
president is Jennifer Fink, and
the new external vice—president

is Christi Hahnfeldt. The position .

of treasurer is now filled by Sara
Shaiman, and that of secretary is
occupied Kathy Bertolet.

In the IFC, the internal vice
president is now David Matta,
and the external vice president is
Christopher Block. Richard
Friedmann is the IFC’s new
treasurer, and Joe Bowman is its
new secretary.

Former Olympic medalist reminisces ab0utPz'tz‘

By Franco Bonacchi
saw‘ Writer '

In 1948, Pitt senior Herb
Douglas became Pitt's second
Olympic medalist by winning the
bronze medal forthe United States
in the broad jump at the London
Olympic games.

Douglas said his motivation to
succeed came from him striving
to be as good as his hero Jesse
Owens, who had won four
Olympic gold medals 12 years
earlier. Owens’ accomplishments
would also inspire Douglas to
create the Jesse Owens
International Trophy Award in
1981.

“I would say that my influence
was Jesse Owens. 1 was only 14
years old when he won four gold
medals in the 1936 Olympic
games, and I thought I could do
the same thing, and I guess that
was my focal point,” Douglas
said. '

Born in the Hazelwood section
of Pittsburgh in 1922, Douglas

 

first became interested in track in
elementary school when his
mother took him to see a track
meet.

Douglas’ interest in track
became more serious during his
years at Gladstone Junior High
School in Hazelwood, located
directly across the street from his
childhood home.

At Gladstone, Douglas was the
city champion in the 75-yard dash
in 1936 and was the 100- yard
dash champion in 1937.

The success didn’t stop there.
Douglas moved on to Allderdice
High School where he lettered
not only in track, but also in
football, basketball and
gymnastics as well.

On the track, Douglas won city
championships in the 100- and
220-yard events and the broad
jump in 1939 and 1940. Douglas
also won state championships in
the broad jump both those years
and the 100- and 220-yard sprints
in 1940.

After graduating high school,

Douglas didn’t come straight to
Pitt but instead went to Xavier
University of Louisiana because
of the school’s track coach, Ralph
Metcalf, who was a member of
the 1932 and 1936 Olympic teams.

But after only two years at
Xavier, Douglas had to return
home during the war to help with
his father who had been blind
since Douglas was five years old.
His father’s condition and
dependence on his son resulted
in Douglas obtaining a deferment
from the war.

“I came back because my dad
couldn’t get help during the war,
but immediately after the war I
couldn’t work for him anymore
because he was a taskmaster and
a perfectionist,” Douglas said.

After leaving the job with his
father, Douglas came to Pitt in
1945 on a football scholarship. '

“I walked down to g the
University of Pittsburgh, and Clark
Shaughnessy, the coach there,
was a very liberal man and gave
me an opportunity to go to Pitt,

and I got in,” Douglas said.

In 1946 Douglas dropped
football and concentrated solely
on track and ﬁeld because of the
insistence of the track coach Carl
Olson.

That strategy paid off as
Douglas won the IC4A
championships in the 100-yard
dash and long jump in 1946.
Douglas would win the long-
jump championship for the next
two years as well.

Douglas’ senior year was to be
his most exciting and memorable
as he would eventually win the
bronze medal in the broad jump
at the London Olympics.

“Well, there wasn’t an Olympics
for 12 years. In 1944 the war was
on, and those of us who were
fortunate enough held on
physically and making the
Olympic team was the real
highlight. It wasn’t winning the
medal as much as making the
team,” Douglas said.

Computer
system ISIS
cannot fill
Pitt’s needs

By Jen Spagnuolo
For The Pitt News

The ' University of
Pittsburgh’s current
computer system, known as
ISIS, is taking a longer time
to perform tasks than the

computer system it
replaced three years
ago.

ISIS stores all student
academic records, including
each ‘student’s past and
present registrations.

ISIS is based on a
computer program de-

signed to keep student.

records for a basic four—year
conege.

The program is equipped
to service a university that
will only have the basic
bachelor of arts and bachelor
of science" programs with
prescribed courses for

-each.

The University of
Pittsburgh is finding
difficulty with this program
because it has more
degrees than the average
college. _

In addition to an overload
of general degrees, each one
has many branches, making
it too diverse for this
system. ‘

This problem is found in
both the undergraduate and
graduate schools.

Eleanor Dim of the School

of Library and Information —

Science said, “We don’t rely
on ISIS because it is not
current.” ,

The amount of time it takes
for each student’s data to be
entered into the computers
is so long that often the
information has changed,
Dim said.

“A student with repeated
courses may not have an
accurate record,” Dim said,
referring to the problem of
the delay on the
undergraduate academic
records.-

Sometimes records aren’t
completed until the end of
the add-drop period, which
is too late for students to
make any necessary
changes.

The Dean’s List and the
list for academic probation
are also delayed fre-
quently. ’

Although there is no
problem with the system’s
technology, the concept is
inefficient.

The old system worked
with forms identifying
courses by ﬁlling in bubbles
with a No. 2 pencil.

All codes were in three-
digit alpha codes, which
were often easier to
remember than the new five-
digit numerical code.

he spent at Pitt were very

enjoyable but also described the
time he spent here as part of a
transition period.

“I enjoyed it because during

those years it was a transition
period where African—American
athletes had to prove themselves.
We had to prove to ourselves that
we could play,” Douglas said.
, As a member of the football
team in 1945, Douglas, along
with Jimmy Joe Robinson who
was already on the team, became
the first black athletes to play
football at Pitt.

“Jimmy Joe and I were a lot like
Jackie Robinson in baseball a few
years later, .and we had to show
that we could play football,”
Douglas added.

Douglas left Pitt with a master’s
degree in education but didn't
have many job opportunities
available to him.

He started with Pabst Brewing
Company in 1950 and stayed
there for the next 15 years.

In 1965, Douglas took a position
with Schieffelin & Co., an importer
of wines and spirits, which he
retired from in 1987 as its vice
president.

“The irony of the whole thing
was that I wanted to coach, and
naturally there weren’t any
coaching positions at the
university or in Pittsburgh at any
level. And with a master’s degree
I said ifl can’t coach I’m going
into another area,” Douglas said.

The elimination of the
Scantron—type registration has
created more chance for error.
Most of the course information
now is handwritten by the
students themselves. Because the
new system requires less
computer work from beginning
to end, there is a built-in error
factor.

With data entry based on
handwriting, there is more chance
for inaccuracies in registration
certiﬁcates, course choices and
academic records.

“I thought I'd go into the

Although Douglas is

also the founder of the Jesse

The annual award is given each

These qualities include

1
years has become one of the
most prestigious awards in all of
sports.

Past winners include Carl Lewis,
Greg Louganis, Roger Kingdom
and this year’s winner Greg
LeMond.

Douglas said, “lt’s international
in scope, and it’s the only one of
its kind. The athletes really want
to win it.”

Douglas said he created the
award not only because of his
personal admiration for Owens,
but also to perpetuate his memory
and inspire the youth of the entire
world.

Douglas, who now lives in
Wyncote, Pa., has been retired
from Schieffelin & Co. for almost
four years.

He was named a Varsity
Letterman of Distinction in 1980
and was recently honored by Pitt
in being named as one of Pitt’s
200 Distinguished Alumni during
the University of Pittsburgh?s
bicentennial celebration in
1987.

In 1988, Douglas was also
inducted into the Pennsylvania‘
Hall of Fame.

Douglas added his feelings
about the current status of the Pitt
track team.

“We have a reservoir of talent
in Pittsburgh in track and field
that should be going to Pitt that
could be developed. I feel,
though, that Pitt is headed in the
right direction, and I have a lot of
respect for the coaches there."

Around ﬁnals time last semester,
a good portion of you may have
noticed that it was virtually im-
possible to actually sit down and
study for more than five or 10
minutes at a time.

You may have even noticed that
your apartment looked cleaner or
that you had never read so many
magazine articles in a week.

The fact of the matter is that
procrastination is linked to a short
attention span. Myself —— being the

Tragedy at CCNY fails to place blame on anyone

People were justgoing crazy. Tbeysboved and
shoved and shoved. 77Jey were on top of me, and
I couldn’t breathe.

That's how Sharmayne Jones of the Bronx
described her moment of terror during the Dec.
28 stampede that occurred at the rap—star-
studded basketball game at the City College in
New York. A crowd of thousands funnelled into
the already packed gymnasium. Becoming
impatient, many started pushing and pressing
those ahead of them. The pressure moved
through the crowd, down a stairway and onto
a small landing before reaching a single door

' open for ticketholders. At the bottom of the

stairway is where eight young victims were
crushed, trampled and smothered to death.

In the aftermath of this nightmarish event,
confusion surrounds the tragedy: Who is excused
from blame? Corners were cut at every possible
angle. (Of course there are logical and valid
excuses for every overlooked corner.)

Most obviously, the need for adequate security
was blatantly ignored. CCNY does not have its
own security force, so security inside the gym
included 38 guards hired from the Pinkerton
Agency and 20 guards from the Nation of Islam
group. —

However at a recent press conference, Conrad
Muhammad, a New York representative said
the Nation of Islam had no connection with the
City College event. (Surely Sean Combs, the
promoter of the event, meant to call the Nation
of Islam and hire them as security guards; he, of
course, must be excused for at least thinking
about security.)

Mathematically, this leaves 38 guards to control
a crowd of thousands inside the gym. Outside
of the gym, the New York Police Department
assigned 30 officers and three sergeants. In the
mad rush to get in, police barricades to control
the crowds outside were pushed down, as the
crowd clearly became more impatient and
boisterous. Yet the police remained in their
patrol cars and made no attempt to control the
crowd. (But who would want to get out of a
warm car at the end of December to attempt to
calm down some juvenile rap fans? Surely, they
thought it would be better to let the kids settle
their disputes themselves, learn to cooperate

Student attendance cam’ signing progmmfntile

and work together. Of course the police must
be excused for trying to help the kids learn how
to settle their own arguments.)

Police officials were not to enter the building
unless summoned or unless there was a clear
danger to public safety. (It’s incredible that a
stampede is not considered a danger to public
safety, but they were trying to follow directions
— so, of course, the police are excused for this,
too.)

Only one entrance was open for all 5,000 fans
to enter. At this entrance, one person was taking
tickets, while another frisked everyone who

came in. (Surely the organizers were just trying .

to make it easier for everyone to decide which
door to come into and which line to" get in by

_ only having one open. Of course they must be

excused for taking that burden of decision off
the fans’ shoulders.)

Over 5,000 tickets were sold for the rap-star
basketball game, yet the capacity of the gym
was a maximum 2,300. There was no control of
the distribution or sales of the tickets by the
college. (But why should a college have any-
thing to do with a major event that its gym is
being used for. That’s deﬁnitely too much to
expect from a university. Of course the college
has a valid excuse.) '

Since all proceeds from the event were to go
to charity, the question of overselling for profit
seems ridiculous. However the charity organi-
zation which was to benefit, the AIDS Educa-
tion Outreach Program, seems to be missing in
action. It is not registered with the office of the
New York Secretary of State, as the law requires,
and no city officials say they have knowledge of
it. (But why should anyone involved with the
concert check out the charity involved? That
would take one phone call, which would
probably require someone to look up a number
in the phone book. We all know how hard this
task is. Surely, we must excuse everyone con-
nected with the concert.

Though the stampede occurred at about 6:30"
p. m., it wasn't until 7:30 when officers entered

    

the gym. The police captain said the police did
not enter because, “There was no clear indica-
tion that a crime was being committed or that
safety was being jeopardized." It would have
been “inappropriate” for police to have en-
tered, said police commissioner Lee Brown. (At
least they were trying to follow police-procedure
guidelines, so of course they have to be excused
for not entering the gym. They were trying to do
their job, and for that they must be forgiven.)
Due to the pressure of the crowd, glass walls

shattered in the hallway. A call was placed to‘ ~

emergency 911 that shots were being fired at
the gym. However a police sergeant called and
indicated that an ambulance was not necessary.
(He probably thought he could take care of
everyone — a noble gesture, so he, too, of
course must be forgiven.)

The fire department, which provides emer.- 2

gency evacuations and shuts down dangerously
crowded events, was not called until 10:08
p.m., more than three hours after the deadly
stampede. (Surely, the‘ police department and
security guards were trying to be considerate
and not bother the firemen so soon after
Christmas. Of course they should be excused
for being thoughtful.) _

Though it had been in their contract, the

' promoters did not purchase liability insurance.

(But why should they have? Accidents only
occur. at a very small percentage of concerts, so

why should they waste their money on some- c

thing that probably wouldn't happen? And why
should the CCNY officials check to make sure
insurance had been bought? This hassle would
have required yet another phone call. They

, probably would have had to lug out a phone ~

book again, which just takes up way too much
time. Of course both parties are excused for this
as well.)

After examining the different aspects of the
event, it is easy to see why authorities are
having difficulty deciding who to blame and
what exactly went wrong. Everyone has valid
excuses for all of their actions. (Of course no
one is to blame. At least everyone meant well.)

Julie Sabol is «at news assistant for The Pitt ’

News.

Similar to most students at the
University of Pittsburgh, I often
find myself asking, “Why?” '

“Why do I, as a history major,
have to enroll in a class that studies
the mechanical intestines of the
Starship Enterprise?” The latest
“why” is, “Why are some athletes
required to sign attendance cards?"

Nathan Hershey, chair of the

. Senate Athletics Committee, has

presented this policy to the Uni-
versity Senate Faculty Assembly. It
requires all first-year athletes and
any academically troubled athletes
to have attendance cards signed by
their instructors every week. It also
requires any athlete absent from
class to present to.his/her instruc-
tor a note from home explaining
the reason for the absence. (Well,
notyet, but it could happen.) Certain
members of the faculty have found
this policy inadequate.‘

The athletes to whom this policy
applies also have opinions on the
subject. Curtis Bray, a senior on the
football squad, has said that he
would keep the program and rec-

. ommend it for future athletes. One
aspect that the athlete alluded to.,is

the fact that the policy is relative —, .

Tim
Desmond

relative in the sense that it usually
benefits athletes who want to
benefit from it. Therefore, it does
not make much sense for the policy
to be mandatory.

The goal of this policy is com-
mendable. Any attempt to improve
the quality of our education should
be beneficial. However mandatory
attendance cards represent a re-
gression in the collegiate lifestyle.
Not only does this policy treat
students like junior high-school kids
during recess, but it discriminates
against the athletes.

Two points have been presented
as proof why this policy is neces-
sary. First, athletes with poor aca-
demic performance perform worse
on the field. Second, class atten-
dance will improve academic per-
formance. Did you ever get the
feeling that statistics and logic
courses were not required when
our “leaders” went to school? If we,
as students, swallow these expla-
nations, then I have found the key

to a national championship. Discard
all of your “G0 Pitt" signs and your
blue and gold. Next football season,
I'll be marching up to Pitt Stadium
with my new sign: “Ace That Test!"

Saying that regular class atten-
dance leads to better grades is like

saying regular doctor examinations

lead to better health. It is all rela-
tive; some lectures are very im-
portant, and others are not so vital.
The general assumption of better
grades due to mandatory atten-
dance died with the assumption
that the majority of the students
graduate in four years.
Some universities with the tele-
vision revenue of Pitt, Penn State
and Notre Dame have been accused
of exploiting and abusing their
athletes rather than assisting them.
Collegiate sports are big money,
and that is a fact. It is very possible
that some of our athletes are not
ready and/or capable of the
workload but are “pushed” into
academic life due primarily to their
athletic skill. The role of athletes in
the university's scheme has been a
topic of controversy fordecades.

This instance is just another _
“chapter” in the “book.”

One phrase that sticks in my
mind is “self-discipline." Proponents
of this policy would have you
believe that it promotes self-disci-
pline. It promotes about as much
self-discipline as mandatory broc-
coli appreciation would for Presi-
dent Bush. Self-discipline is a very

straightforward concept — “self” ’

being the key.

Self-discipline can only be in-
stilled by inner motivation. A
common example is the dnig-addict
who enters rehabilitation. The
program is useless until the addict
fosters motivation from within.

This issue is not of the utmost
importance. What is important is
the ideas behind the policy. Such
strict regulation of personal choice
is also found in prison and elemen-
tary school.

The fact that college students are
not part of these institutions should
worry you. If only our Pitt athletes
were satanic, transvestite, cross-
dressers maybe this debate would
be important enough to make it to
“Geraldo." .

short aga

inst Smith, Connecticut

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

The Pitt basketball team lost 87-77 to
Connecticut at the Hartford Civic Center
but continued to prove it can play with top
teams by staying in the game all the way
with the eighth-ranked Huskies.

The Panthers, whose record falls to 11-
5 overall, 3-1 in the Big East, were making
runs at UConn (12-1, 3-1) leads all night.
The last of those runs ended with just over
a minute left. Sean Miller had a wide—open
three-pointer that could have brought the
Panthers within four with 1:20 left, but he
missed. Orlando Antigua grabbed the
rebound, but he failed on the follow-up
attempt.

Pitt leads were rare. After Jermaine
Morgan gave them the early lead with a
three-point shot, a string of Panther
defensive breakdowns and fouls helped
the Huskies build a 19-1 1 lead. The baskets
came mostly from the inside, including
two slams off back—door cuts by junior
forward Scott Burrell. Pitt came right back
and took a 21-19 lead on a basketbyjunior
forward Chris McNeal. UConn tied it on, as
guard Chris Smith converted two foul
shots after a technical foul on the Pitt
bench.

McNeal gave the Panthers their last lead
of the game at 23-22 with 8:10 remaining
in the half. Connecticut dominated the
remaining time, scoring 20 points to Pitt’s
nine, to lead 43-29 at the half. The Panthers
scored only four points in the last 5:28 —

Turnovers and losing the battle inside
were the biggest problems. Pitt threw the
ball away on three occasions on simple
passes back to the point in the first half
alone. They had 12 turnovers for the half,

after averaging nine per game all season.

The Huskies dominated the inside, scoring
18 points inside compared to 14 for Pitt,
and outrebounded the Panthers 23-11.

Connecticut’s press forced Pitt’s big men
to handle the ball, thus creating the
turnovers. Ahmad Shareefs delusions of
size hurt, as he missed a dunk and an
alley—oop.

Those problems weren’t so evident in
the second half. An early Panther run
capped by two baskets by Darren
Morningstar brought the score to 45-38,
UConn, with 17:13. The lead went back
and forth between seven and 12 points
until the 5:44 mark. Burrell chased Miller
down on a breakaway and drilled him, but
Miller" hit the free throws to bring Pitt
within five, 71-66. A trade of free throws
was followed by four consecutive points
by UConn: two free throws by power
forward Toraino Walker and a jumper by
Smith, which returned the lead to nine
with 4:37 left.

An exchange of baskets was followed
by what seemed to be a death blow for
P-itt. After missing an inside shot,
Morningstar stripped the ball from Husky
reserve center Dan Cyrulik. The ball
appeared to hit Smith on the way out of
bounds, but Connecticut was awarded the
ball. Morningstar was called for a technical

Lady Panthers face Seton Hall in Big East battle 5

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

In women’s basketball last
season the Pitt Lady Panthers and
the Seton Hall Bucettes split their
series with each team winning on
the opponents’ home court.

The Lady Panthers are hoping
that at least part of that scenario
holds up again this year, as they
travel to South Orange, N.J.,
tonight for a game that both
squads desperately want to win.

Seton Hall enters this game
with an overall record of 9-4.
However it has a conference mark
of 1—3,- losing three straight
contests after winning its league
opener against the St. John's
Express.

Of their first four conference

‘ games, only one has been on the

Bucettes’ home court, a 76-54
drubbing at the hands of the
high-flying Miami Hurricanes,
winners of 12 in a row and
currently ranked No. 25 in the
USA Today/CNN poll.
In their three losses, the
Bucettes have managed to keep
the ﬁnal margin below 20 points
only once, a 67-53 loss to the
powerful Connecticut Lady
Huskies. Their other loss came in
a 67-47 romp in Manley Field
House by the Syracuse
Orangewomen. Rookie Angel
Lewis scored nine of Syracuse’s
first 11 points en route to a career-
high 21 points, including two of
three from three-point range and
nine of 11 from the line. She also
grabbed a team—high eight
rebounds and was named Big

East Rookie of the Week for her
efforts.

“They are really going to be up
for this game,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said. “'l'hey’re coming
into this game with the same
conference record as us, and
they’ve lost three in a row. It’s
going to be tough.”

Pitt does not enter the game in
any better shape than the
Bucettes. After posting a 3-0
record at the beginning of the
season, the Lady Panthers lost
five out of their six non-
conference games. They opened
their Big East season with back-
to-back road losses to the
nationally ranked Providence
Lady Friars and the fast-starting
Orangewomen.

The Lady Panthers then
returned to Fitzgerald Field House
on Jan. 8 for their first home
game since Dec. 1. They defeated
the Villanova Wildcats 63-56
before running into the
Hurricanes’ gale-force attack this
past Saturday, getting blown off
the court in a 73-54 drubbing in
a game shown on a tape-delay
basis by the KBL cable network.

“I thought we played well in
the first half against Miami,” Bruce
said. “We went in at half time
down by 12; that’s only a three-
pointer away fromsingle digits.
We just weren’t getting our shots
to fall, and they pulled away in
the second half.”

If Pitt is to be successful against
Seton Hall, it must shut down
Bucette center Kelley Moore.
Moore is leading the Bucettes in

There are currently two Pitt
alums holding NFL head-coaching
positions: Mike Ditka of the
Chicago Bears and the Kansas
City Chiefs’ Marty Schottenheimer.

But that may soon change.

Dallas Cowboys defensive
coordinator Dave Wannstedt is
the leading candidate to fill the
vacancy left by the retirement of
Chuck Noll. Wannstedt, a Baldwin
native, met with the Steelers on
Saturday for nearly eight hours. It
was the second time in less than
a week that Wannstedt had met
with the team.

Wannstedt, a graduate of
Baldwin High School, was a Pitt
offensive tackle from 1970-73.
As a senior he earned second-
team All-East honors and was a

captain on a team that featured
Tony Dorsett in his first year.
Drafted by the Green Bay Packers
in the 15th round of the 1974 NFL
draft, Wannstedt spent his rookie
season on injured reserve.
Wannstedt began his coaching
career at Pitt in 1975 and had
coaching stints at Oklahoma State,
Southern California and the NFL’s
Miami Dolphins before he was
hired as the Cowboys’ defensive
coordinator in 1989. ’
The Steelers hope to name
Noll’s successor within the next
two weeks, but in the meantime
they’ve been busy interviewing
several candidates. Besides
Wannstedt, the Steelers have
recently talked with defensive
line coach Joe Greene, Kansas
City Chiefs defensive coordinator
Bill Cowher, Houston Oilers
offensive coordinator Kevin

Wannstedt could be third Pitt alum to be NFL head coac    

  
  

Gilbride and former defensive '
coordinator Woody Widenhofer, I
now with the Detroit Lions. 6

After Noll announced his,
retirement last month, - there was ’

speculation that Greene would g

become the Steelers’ next head
coach, but since then several other
coaches have been added to the
field. Greene, who played with
the Steelers for 13 seasons (1969-
’82) and made 10 Pro Bowl
appearances, was inducted into
the NFL Hall of Fame in 1987, his
first season of eligibility.

John Fox, a former Pitt assistant
coach who also served as the
Steelers’ defensive backs coach
for the past three seasons, was
interviewed for the head-
coaching position but last week
accepted a position as the San
Diego Chargers secondary coach. ..

- When Edward De “lame-duck
owner” Bartolo Sr. put his
professional hockey club, our
beloved Pens, on the market, his
sales ad might have looked
something like this:

For Sale: profitable NHL
franchise, defending Stanley Cup
champions. Assets include: best
player in hocleey, best offensive
defensemen in hocleey, plethora
of young, offensive talent, ULF,

‘ underrated defense that plays

when it needs to, goaltender that
CAN win the big game and a
town willing to pay any price to
see agame. Mustsell. Asleing price
— $60 million (less than an
expansion franchise).

Now ifl were in the market for
"a sports team, this could interest
me. In fact, the thought of securing
a proven entity that requires
virtually no maintenance to
sustain its efficiency is
unbelievably appealing. It’s
simple; Get the cash, sign the
papers, kick back and enjoy the
ride — to another Stanley Cup,
another 16 playoff sellouts and
another summer as toast of the
town.‘ Sounds simple, right? Not!
V In his haste to rid himself of this
“liability” known as the Penguins,
DeBartolo handed the reigns of
the franchise to Howard Baldwin,

this “Ca1ifornia—surfer dude” of a
rich guy who’s concerned more
about the Pens’ bottom lines than
who patrols the Pens’ blue line.

Prior to his purchase, word
leaked that Baldwin was planning
to sell off some “assets” to raise
his proﬁt margin. When these
“assets” were defined as Lemieux,
Coffey, Recchi and Stevens,
Baldwin put the rumors to rest
with a slew of press conferences.
He reassured the media and the
fans that this wouldn’t happen:
There would be no house
cleaning. For anyone remotely
aware of the Penguins history,
whenever there is an ever-so slight
chance of something going a tiny
bit wrong, then there is a 99.99-
percent chance that something
disastrous will take place. Well,
folks, look out for disaster time.
While it can’t be considered
housecleaning, Baldwin has
begun dusting his Penguin
franchise for flaws. And instead
of finding problems, he’s created
them.

As every hockey fan in North
America is well aware, Penguin
defenseman Paul Coffey is
currently teetering on the plank
of the Pittsburgh supercruiser.
The high-flying “Doctor” has been
tradebait for a good month now.

Brian
Gallagher

Some treatment for a four—time
Stanley Cup winner who gives a
team 85-90 points a year from the
blue line and never gives anything
but his best effort!

For all his efforts, all his
scintillating rushes up the ice,
Coffey still gets little respect. He’s
spent the last month on and off

the power play, seeing fewer and 2
fewer minutes in the third period. :
He even tried to mimic a left ~
' and isn’t a great defender. His
results. Some may say that these ‘

winger for a game — to pathetic

moves should be blamed on
Scotty Bowman or Craig Patrick.
Whoever thinks that is dead
wrong.

The manipulation of Paul
Coffey is the direct result of a
trickle-down demand from
Howie. Bowman experiments
with the lineup ONLY because
he’s preparing for Coffey’s
departure, which is hinted to him
by Patrick. And Patrick ONLY

looks for a good trade after

Baldwin tells Patrick that he wants
to trim the budget. As much as it’s
hard to comprehend, Bowman
and Patrick are ONLY doing what

TI-IE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 15, 1992

the'y’re told by the guy who holds
the checkbook.

For me, it’s hard to comprehend
someone of Baldwin’s
considerable wealth and status to
act in such an incompetent way.
In addition to rendering Coffey
useless during this fiasco, Baldwin
is on the verge of putting the
Penguins’ chances of repeating
as Stanley Cup champions in
serious jeopardy.

If the Pens don’t win the Cup
again, itwill be extremely difficult
for Baldwin to defend his decision
to trade Coffey. Coffey is 31 years
old, makes a million per season

patented “doggie—style,
moonwalk” defense, in which he
slides on all fours into Tom
Barrasso’s pads, causes every Pen
fan to cringe. But at the same
time Coffey wouldn’t be on his
knees if his offensive teammates
did more backchecking — like
they did in the playoffs.

In any sport, the season
following a championship should
be a happy one for the fans of
that town — chance to brag to
enemies, a time to “savor the
silver” (couldn’t resist). Instead,
Penguin fans are busy worrying
about who’s gonna’ work the
point on their power play and

trade rumors.

Last weekend I attended a
Sabres-Oilers game at the Aud in
Buffalo. When a few Buffalo fans
found out I was from Pittsburgh,
they assumed that I must be
“loving life” by being a Pen fan.
The truth was I wasn’t. They
were shocked at my attitude
toward the Pens’ season so far.
But not being loyal Penguin fans,
they didn’t understand the
paranoia involved in rooting for
a bad-luck team. It’s bad enough
having to hold your breath every
game to see whether Mario is in‘
uniform racking up four or five
points or laying on the locker-
room floor, unable to move. But
to see the chemistry of a perfectly
fine championship—caliber hockey
team being screwed with  that
bothers me.

If I were Howard Baldwin, I’d
keep Paul Coffey. Doing so does
two things: First, it keeps together
the nucleus of a great offensive
hockey team that has shown it
knows how to win a Cup.
Secondly, it would cover my ass
as a first—year owner of a team
that needs no new direction.

The bottom line goes this way;
If Baldwin forces a trade of Coffey
and the Pens don’t repeat as
champs, it’s Baldwin’s fault. On
the other hand, if Baldwin leaves
the team to Patrick and Bowman
(and doesn’t trade Coffey) and
the Pens don’t win the Cup, then
it’s the players and coaches’ fault.
At that time, he could be justified
in trading players. But for now,
as new owner of a championship
team, Baldwin had better do the
latter — leave it -alone — if he
wants to survive in this town for
more than one season.

THE'PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, January 15, 1992

By John Labriola
Smﬂ Writer

The Pitt Hockey Club has been plagued
by penalties during this season; last
weekend’s performance against the
University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown was
no exception. _

The Panthers took on the Mountain Cats
on Sunday at Golden Mile Ice'Center and
skated away with an 11-6 victory, but Pitt
took the majority of the penalties (14 of
the 19 total) during the competition.

The Panthers started the competition

‘ out a little weaker than they were at the

end of their fall season. They were able to
quickly capitalize on the fact that the
Mountain Cats are still in the developmental
stage.

University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown
formed A it’s ice—hockey team only two
seasons ago, and it is still playing with a
player/coach. This places the team at a
disadvantage when he is in the game and
not able to survey the entire rink.

“I think that they are improving every
game,” Pitt’s team captain, Dave Koval,
said. “They are going to lose, vbeingthat
they are an expansion team, but theytwill
be okay.” E, . _

The Panthers netted their first goal “of -
the evening during the first three minutes _
of play. Scoring the ‘goal for Pitt-was

Dennis Scanlon, with an assist going to -

Deron Stock.
At the 13:35 mark, both teams began "to

‘ open upthe penalty-box doors. During

the first period the Panthers racked up six
penalties, while the Mountain Cats received
one. A
The Panthers’ second goal was short-
handed and came in at 7:33. Scoring for

Pitt was ‘Koval, with assists going to Vic
DiSanti and Scott Giordano. '

Less than a minute later the Mountain
Cats capitalized on a Panther penalty by
netting their first goal of the evening at the
8:43 mark.

Once the teams were back at even
strength, Pitt geared itself toward scoring.
The Panthers netted their third goal of the
evening 40 seconds after the teams returned
to full strength. Scoring Pitt’s_ third goal
was Giordano, with an assist going to Bill
Crousey.

A The Panthers again ran into penalties.
Fred Ebert was latched with a two—minute,
checking-from-behind call as well as a 10-
minute misconduct penalty.

Seeing yet another opportunity open
up, the UP] squad quickly scored its
second power-play goal of the evening.
Once the teams were back at full strength
again, Pitt was able to refrain from receiving
any further penalties during the first period.

However’ the Panthers turned their
attentions toward scoring, and that is
precisely what they did. The Pitt squad
was able to net two more goals before the
clock .ran out for the first period. Scoring

. for Pitt were DiSanti and Don Fedor, with

assists going to Koval, John Carlins and
Mike Mahoney. '

,",The second period proved to be less
volatile. The Panthers took three penalties,
while UP] took only two.

. The Panthers set the pace for the second
period; They began by netting their sixth
goal at the 12:56 mark. Scoring for Pitt was

' Carlins with an assist by Koval.

The Panthers faltered when Brent Spitzer
was given an unsportsmanlike—conduct

penalty. Thirty-six seconds later Steve

Karas followed his teammate into the

penalty box with a roughing call.

UP] retaliated moments later by netting
its third power-play goal of the competition.
The Panthers came back only seconds
later to score a short-handed goal. Scoring

the Panthers’ seventh goal was Crousey-

off a pass from Phil Laux.

The Panthers finished off the second
period by raising the score to 10-3 via
three consecutive goals. Scoring the ﬁnal
goals of the second period for Pitt were
DiSanti, Crousey and Koval, with assists
going to Dave DiPalma, Giordano, Scanlon
and Laux.

‘ The third period once again found the
Panthers in the penalty box. Pitt received
five penalties, while UP] received two.

Pitt set up to score early in the period
and did so during one of its own power
plays.

Scoring the Panthers’ final goal was
team captain Koval. Pitt’s 11th goal of the
night was also Koval’s "third goal of the
night, giving him a hat trick.

During the ﬁnal 13 minutes of play the
Mountain Cats managed to net three more
goals to close the scoring, 11-6. The

in the penalty box. The last was Karas,

who entered the box with :23 remaining in

play on a five-minute roughing call. '
Koval summed up the Panthers’
performance after the game. “We stunk,”
Koval said, “because we let Pitt-Johnstown
score six goals against us, and if we play
that way next week in Morgantown [against
the West Virginia Mountaineers], we're

going to get blown out in front of the

I  College can be a struggle for
' any young adult. With strict
, deadlines and heavier workloads
_ ',in’.classes, not having mom and
_ .5-—1da'd around to depend on and
.3 other pressures,

A o,verwhelming.
'» Compound the new academic

R can be

and social pressures with

pressures to perform athletically,
and it seems almost impossible.
Yet the words “student-athlete”
immediately conjure up a'negative
image in many ,people’s heads.
They think of the free rides that
football and men’s basketball

— players purportedly receive by
A rarely attending class and having

boosters lavish expensive gifts
on them. _

V The athletes in these two sports,
however, compose only about

. 30 percent of the student—athlete

population. Since football and

‘men’s basketball are the only two
sports that generate revenue for
the University of Pittsburgh, they

receive a disproportionately large
amount of the millions of dollars
allocated for athletics.

The remaining dollars must be

divided among 13 varsity sports

and the other 70 percent of the
student—athlete population. While

these other sports generate their

share of All-Americans and
conference championships, they

receive less funding and

recognition for the simple reason
that they do not generate the

‘numbers of spectators or land

lucrative television contracts like

football and basketball do.
Athletes in non-revenue sports

must deal with many of the same

problems as athletes in football

and basketball. Still, many of the 5

players and coaches of these
teams do not feel as though they
receive second-class treatment.
“I think that one of my athletes
does not receive any different
treatment than, say, a football
player,” said women’s basketball
head coach Kirk Bruce. “I think
most of the other coaches that

I’ve talked to feel the same way. '

We receive the same type of
services.”

-While the treatment that an
athlete in a non—revenue sport
receives may be nearly identical
to that of an athlete in one of the
“glamour” sports, these athletes
still face added pressures that the

normal college student does not. ‘

Student-athletes must carry at
least 12 credits, attend a two-
hour study hall twice a week and
put in library time. Some coaches
also require athletes to’ spend
time at the Office of Support
Service for Student-Athletes. On
top ‘of that, the athletes must
attend practice. V '

A typical day for a women’s
basketball athlete . looks
something like this: Wake up and
eat breakfast for a class at nine.
(For most, classes run from 9.a.m.
until 2:50 p.m.) Before practice
starts, get any necessary treatment
from the trainers and be dressed
and ready to go at 3:30. Practice
runs from 3:30 until 5:45 on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.’
On Thursday, practice runs from
6:15 until 8:15 in the morning.

‘Mondays are off-days, but there

are practices on both Saturday
and Sunday mornings.
Circumstances may cause a
player’s schedule to differ from

that occasionally.

“If a player has a class at 5:45
one afternoon, we let them out at
live so they can shower and get
there on time,” Bruce said. “We
try to discourage them from taking
those classes because it limits
what we can do in practice
without all of the players there.
However we try to work around
their schedules because we ﬁgure
that we don’t run the university.”

While these sports may not
control the university, athletes
still have pressure to perform
placed upon them by those within
the institution. Often, many
people do not realize the kind of
schedule that these athletes must
maintain. '

Away games also present
problems for the athletes.
Women’s basketball games at
schools like Georgetown and
Seton Hall fall on Wednesday

nights. The budget does not allow ‘

for ﬂying to these games. By the
time the games are over and the
players are dressed and
showered, they do not get on the
road earlier than 10 p.m. After a
4 1/ 2-hour drive, they return at 2
or 3 a.m. Then they have to get
up for practice early the next day.
For games they can fly to, like
those at Hartford, Conn., orMiami,
Fla., the team stays overnight
and takes the first ﬂight out in the
morning. I

“A lot of times we can get back
pretty late or have ‘to wake up
pretty early,” Bruce said. “It can
really be rough sometimes.”

With these pressures’ to achieve
on the playing field while
attending classes mounting on
players, coaches’ and the
university have implemented a

 

couple of options to help student-
athletes discipline themselves.

Some coaches require players
to have their teachers sign class
cards. The student—athlete must
get the instructor of every class to
sign a slip of paper to show that
the player attended class. These
cards must be signed by every
instructor that a player has for a
six—week period each semester.
If an athlete fails to have a teacher
sign a card, misses class or loses
a card, he or she must have the
cards signed for a 10-week period.

Another way for coaches to
make sure that the athletes are
performing up to standard in the
classroom is to go directly to the
instructors. On top of coaching
and recruiting duties, many
coaches find out how players are
doing in a certain class. Some
coaches, if they feel a player is in
a borderline situation, will warn
the athlete and point him or her
in the direction of help. If a
player’s grades do not improve,
the player faces suspension or
ineligibility.

A third avenue that student-
athletes have for academic help
is the Office of Support Services
for Student-Athletes.

Founded in 1976, Support
Services dedicates its efforts to
helping the student—athlete excel
inthe classroom. Every Division
I-A school has some kind of
program to help athletes with
academics. The program answers
directly to the office of the provost
but receives funding from the
National Collegiate Athletic,
Association.

“We have tried to design our
program to meet the needs of all
the student—athletes in the

ofsmdem‘-athlete

university,” said Dr. Ron Brown,
director of Academic Support
Services. “We don’t cater to any
one program or any one
individual athlete. This is the one
place that a student-athlete can
come and be treated as just a
student.” '  ’

' Brown estimated that right now
Support Services ' helps
approximately 65-70 students a
day or about 40 percent of the
athletes at the university.

The student—athlete can receive
academic help from Support
Services in a variety of programs.
Some services offered are tutorial
labs and individual or»: group
tutoring. , ,

I After a student comes looking
for help in a specific area, Support
Services staff request information
from that student’s professor. It
evaluates that information and
determines what kind of help the
student needs. 6

“Sometimes one student might
need a couple of extra hours with
a- course,” Brown said.-. “Wewill
set them up with a_tutor,- and that
appointment is treated like a
scheduled class. However if a
student comes looking for help,
they had better show up,” _

If a student misses a'7tutoring
session without a good reason,

such as being sick or being out of

town with a team, awarning is
issued. The second time, the
athlete must forego any services
until he or she is serious about
wanting help.

In addition to tutorial work,
students also can take advantage
of skills—building workshops.
Seminars are held on topics such

as note—taking, writing skills and‘
math skills. These workshops
allow students to improve in areas
in which they may feel deficient.

The third function that Support
Services offers the student-athlete
is advising.

“We offer both pre-advising
and post—advising,” Brown said.
“We look to see what the student
needs to take and where they
should be academically in the
pre—advising session. Then after
they register, we look to see if the
classes they are taking will provide
any conﬂicts with their schedules.”

For example, if the women’s
basketball team travels a lot on
Mondays and a player needs to

foul for protesting andpushing
the official’s hand out of his face.
Smith hit one of two free throws
to give the Huskies a 10-point
lead, which became 12 after a
monster dunk by Burrell.

Pitt came right back with a
three-point shot by first—year
guard Jerry McCullough and a
driving shot from the lane by

- Miller. This setup Miller’s attempt
to bring the team within four with

1:20 left. When UConn finallylf

controlled the ball, Antigua fouled
first—year guard Brian Fair, who
hit both free throws to seal the
Husky victory.

Pitt did turn around the
problems of the first half,
committing only six turnovers
and wiping the glass for 25
second-half rebounds to only 14
for UConn. They never did stop
Chris Smith, however, as he
scored 28, including three three-
pointers. Center Rod Sellers
poured in 16 and grabbed eight
rebounds.

Morningstar came on late,
scoring 16 of his 18 points in the
second half, as well as grabbing
six of his seven rebounds.
McCullough scored all 11 of his
points in the second half.

Coach

Continued from page 13
However he wasn’t considered a
serious candidate to replace Noll.

Wannstedt, who was
instrumental in Dallas’ success
last season, has been a finalist for
other head—coaching positions.
In 1986 he was a leading candidate
to fill the vacancy at Washington
State, but it went to Dennis
Erickson, who succeeded Jimmy

._ Johnson at the University of Miami
two years later.

Two years ago Wannstedt
became a finalist for the Stanford
job that went to Dennis Green,
who was just named the
Minnesota Vikings’ new head
coach. The Steelers apparently
would like Nollssuccessor to be
familiar with /the Pittsburgh
community, and Wannstedt has
obvious ties to the area which
can only help his case.

“I know what is involved,”
Wannstedt told The Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, “I know being from
Pittsburgh doesn’t mean anything
unless you’re winning ballgames,
getting into the playoffs and
winning championships. That’s
when being from Pittsburgh is
nice.”

take a course like General Writing,
which a student can only miss
three’ times before failing
automatically, Support Services
would recommend against taking
a General Writing course that
meets on Monday.

The three goals of Support
Services are simple-:

1. Improve the retention rate of
athletes at the university. In other
words, ‘if athletes enter as first-
year students, the university
would like to see them graduate.

2. Help with the academic status
of student-athletes.

3. Improve the graduation rates.
This third goal is the main
emphasis of Support Services.

“That’s mainly why we’re here,”

Brown said. “If students enter
and never graduate, then what
have they done except waste a
lot of time and a lot of money.”
Brown cited stricter NCAA
guidelines as a reason for
programs like Support Services.
“Twenty years ago, if a school
wanted an athlete, there were
ways to get them enrolled,” Brown
said. “Now there’s a big emphasis
to get those kids an education.
They must show adequate
academic progress or they can
no longer stay in school.
“Today there are greater
pressures on student-athletes than
ever before," he said. “Many
‘regular’ students don’t graduate
in five years, but yet people expect

1

athletes to be done irt four. We
try and -help student-athletes stay
competitive both in the classroom
and on the playing field.”

The Support Services program
appears to be doing its job of
improving the quality of work of
the student-athlete in the
classroom. According to a survey
published in the March 27, 1991,
issue of The Chronicle of Higher
Education, the five-year
graduation rate for all Division I
athletes entering school in 1984
was 56.1 percent —— far ahead of
the 47.9-percent graduation rate
for all students over the same
period.

While student-athletes may
have a negative stereotype placed

1 17

upon them, they often find that“
playing a sport while attending ,
school helps them in ways other
than just increased athletic ability. -
“Playing athletics in college ’
gave me the opportunity to» go . . -

places other students did not have
chances to go,” Bruce said. “It
also helped me mature and learn

to be dependent on myself and

not just other people. It allowed
me to learn the importance of

working as a team, whether on -I

the court or in the workplace. If
I hadn’t played [basketball] while
I was in school, I don’t think that
I would have as many
opportunities as I dg today. I,
hope that’s what my players are
gaining from this, too.”
