Convocation Committeesends proposal to Provost

ByBrianBerger

Showcase Editor

The committee charged with the pro-
gramming of a,convocation center/ basket-
ball arena issued a detailed report to Provost
Donald Henderson this week asking the uni-
versity to turn the facility into a 12,500 to
16,000 seat arena with the ability to hold
commencement exercises, host both men’s
and women’s basketball contests and other
special events. '

The report cited the project as “the one
with the most potential to make a lasting clif-
feience in the community and the university”
of the four proposed Jump Start projects, as
well as listed three site considerations for the
planned building as well as financial and
budgetary measures to be analyzed.

In addition, the report attacked the present
facilities of the athletic programs cunent resi-
dences, Trees Hall and the Fitzgerald Field
House, as “falling far short of meeting the
needs of the university,” a concern that was
voiced by various university groups at the
committees open hearing in late January.

Among the committees chief concerns,
according to Chairperson Carol Sprague of
the athletics department, was to “not lose

space that was already there,” a reference to
the committee’s decision that the Field House
and Trees Hall be retained and renovated in
an effort to house the athletic teams which
will not be given space in the planned arena.

The committee also recommended that “all
intercollegiate activity, except swimming and
diving, be removed from Trees Hall. This will
free Trees to meet current and additional
programming needs for instruction, intramur-
al, recreation and community activities.”

The committee issued its programming
recommendations surrounding the proposed
arena on two priority levels, urging that until
all level one requirements are met and that
level two requirements be considered only if
financing and space are available_.

At the top of the comrnitIee’s list was that
the building meet minimum reqiirernents of
commencement, as specified by the oﬂice of
special events, and adhere to both Big East
and NCAA minimum capacity requirements.
The committee added that its decision was
based on the belief that Trees and the Field
House will be renovated and that, “It is
essential that at times when the center is con-
ﬁgured for events other than basketball, there
will be auxiliary space for our intercollegiate
basketball teams to practice within the cen-

ter.” The report added that moving practices
to the Field House would create “a domino
effect” on the programming of the Field
House and Trees Hall.

Also of level one concern to the committee
was the housing of the gymnastics team, cur-
rently lodged in Trees Hall. The report speci-
fied that appropriate renovations be made to
the Field House to accommodate the squads
and, “If the Field House renovation plans do
not include gymnastics, then the design of
the convocation center must include accorn—
modations for gymnastics.”

The convocation center will also be the
home to special athletic events, which the
report defined as “major competitions, sea-
son-ending events and tournaments for
wrestling, volleyball or gymnastics.” These
could be various championship matches
from the WPIAL, State, Big East or NCAA. In
addition, concerts, lectures, and expositions
sponsored by the Pitt Program Council, the
Office of Special Events and the director of
University Conference Coordination will be
sheltered in the center.

The level two endorsements include meet-

ing facilities and assembly rooms, arena
boxes if funding is available, a Hall Of Fame
room to be located either in the lobbies or

open areas of the center and a self-contained
wellness center for faculty, students staff and
university visitors. Although this may not be
necessary if the center is located on the
upper campus where existing facilities are sit-
uated.

The committee, which was not responsible
for determining a location for the center,
offered three sets of sites as possible loca-
tions. One: Trees Hall/ Fitzgerald Field
House vicinity, considering areas such as OC
parking lot, the playing fields, Pitt Stadium
and the Public Housing properties such as
Robinson Court. Two: The main (lower)
campus including the parking facility
between Hillman and the Camegie Lll)l‘;U‘l€S,
Syria Mosque site, Panther Hollow vicinity.
Three: edge of Oakland campus, including
the Oakland portal near Magee \Women’s
Hospital and the Pittsburgh Technology
Center.

In forging its site decisions, the committee
stressed that, “The least costly site. should not
necessarily be the site that is selected for the
new convocation center; the site with the
most benefits relative to cost should be
selected.”

College is more than just class-
rooms and getting through
required credits, according to Pitt
philosophy chair Rudolph
\X/eingartner.

This idea and others, found in
his book I/rzclergrczcluate
l:‘clzrcati‘on.- Goals and Means
have won Weingaitner the 1993
Frederic W. Ness Book Award.

The award is given by the
Association of American Colleges
to the writer of the book which
has made “the most significant
contribution to the understand-
ing and improvement of liberal
education” (hiring the previous
year.

Weingartner stressed that this
book is not implicitly critical of
the education process. He
doesn’t try to offer absolute solu-
tions, but rather he wants to
make educators think about the
methods they are currently
using.

Forty Book Center scholarships to am students  

By Pete Oppelt

For IbePittNews

The power of Pitts student gov-
eminent boards working together
recently helped pass a Book Center
scholarships plan to aid graduate
and Lmdergraduate students.

Forty scholarships, with funding
from Pitt’s Book Center, worth $300
a piece will be awarded in the near
future. Graduate and Professional
Student Association President Steve
Parks said distribution numbers are

“It’s meant to help discussion.
It’s abstract. My book is not one
of those that says, ‘This is the
way you should do it,”’ he said.

The book discusses education
in what Weingartner refers to 
“little packets." These packets
range from developing character
traits to using extracurricular
activities as a way of achieving a
balanced education.

Weingartner said activities like
belonging to a fraternity or the-
ater group or participating in stu-
dent government can contribute
to a person’s education goals if
the university works closely with
those groups.

These activities allow students
a break from the competitiveness
of the classroom as well as offer
experience for the real world.
He said the reality is that in the
job market, most work gets done
in teams where cooperation, not
competition, is the key.

Another “packet” is the acade-
mic advisor, which Weingartner

not final but he expects graduate
students to receive 14, with the
remainder going to undergrads.

Though qualiﬁcations have not
yet been detemiined, scholarships
will probably be awarded to stu-
dents showing financial need along
with educational prowess, Parks
said.

The undergraduate Student
Government Board had been
working for the past year on a plan
for undergraduate student leaders
to receive the scholarships, accord-

snow angels.

And then the angels appeared . . .

Sophomore Mark Amick took advantage of yesterday's winter weather to make

ing to Parks. The GPSA reviewed
the plan and decided “every stu-
dent should have a chance,” Parks
said.

Parks said a revised proposal
was compiled “highlighting the
half-million dollar profit the book-
store makes,” frorn which the
scholarship funds could be drawn.

Marcy Roberts, president of the
College of General Studies Student
Council, endorsed the new plan
since it included part-time students,
something the initial proposal did

not do.

The revised plan was sent to
administration officials, but lay dor-
mant until the GPSA published that
the bookstore has a $7 million
reserve and made approximately
$527,000 in excess revenue from
textbook sales in the October 1992
newsletter.

“Publishing the numbers put the
bookstore on the defensive,” Parks
said. Two months after the GPSA
plan was proposed, it was passed.

John DeVitto, assistant vice chan-

cellor for Business and Finance, has '
agreed to increase the number of
scholarships each year, Parks said. .

Roberts stated that DeVitto has
also been receptive to looking into
including part—time students in the
plan, possibly with reduced “schol-
arship amounts.

Student leaclers are pleased that
their elforts have made the scholar-
ship package reality. “How often
can student governments, working
in some unity, get free money?”
Parks said.

hen Counseling
 Center staff speaks
to campus groups it
finds that students are often
confused about what counsel-
ing is all about. Students often
don’t know how to go about
getting an appointment and
they ask questions such as
“don’t you have to be a little
weird to go to the Counseling
Center?” These kinds of ques-
tions have been answered
before in this column, but
they are important enough to
revisit every once in a while.
Counseling, most simply
stated. is an interaction
between a person who is
“stuck" in some way and in
need of help, and another per-
son who is trained in helping
people get “unstuck." Going
for counseling does not mean
you are weird in any way,
although being a little weird
could probably define most of
us at one time or another.
Most students who seek coun—
seling come because they

r -- ,_sy»y‘.‘‘',r:»‘»,,.g.:' .; . "

have a particular problem in
living that they want help
with, or because they are
experiencing stress or having
some feelings they don’t
understand.

therapy are referred outside
the university.

The actual counseling
process is harder to describe
since it differs from counselor
to counselor and from student
to student. Sometimes coun-
seling consists simply of shar-
ing your thoughts and feelings

 

Counseling is not just for the weird

in confidence with a coun-
selor who is objective and a
good listener. This is often
helpful when you have a deci-
sion to make. Sometimes
counseling provides you with,
or directs you to, certain types
of information. At other times,
counseling may help you to
change your feelings about
yourself or others, or help you
to change some of your
behavior.

The reasons for coming are
many, and the counseling
strategies employed are also
varied. The only constant
is that all of the energies of
the counselor are focused on
trying to help you, the stu-
dent. lt doesn't always work,
btrt our student evaluation
forms suggest that most stu-
dents who seek counseling
believe that it has been help-
ful to them. Please call 648-

individual or group counseling
programs.

The Clinton Plan?

Last night, for the first time in 12 years, a Democratic president
addressed a joint session of Congress. And in that address, President Bill
Clinton outlined his bold new vision of America.

He spoke of a Utopian state where every child receives vaccination,
every pregnant woman receives prenatal care and every American
receives_, ro_per__,‘ 21fl‘Ol‘V(l2Il)le“¥l]C21l[l1 care but does not stand in line all day

, .

Clinton reiterated
national service for college tuition loans —— a program that would be
twice as big as the Peace Corps was back in the  He promised to
end welfare as we know it by offering education and job training for
those in need and setting a two-year cap on benefits.

His proposal will create 750,000 summer jobs for youth in poor urban
areas this year, and he wants to secure the American dream for genera-
tions to come. And this is a small part of his plan.

He said that every dollar raised in taxes will be matched with a cut in
federal spending. He said that the tax burden must be boum by those
who can afford it, asking the most of those who beneﬁted in the past
(the 1980s). Although he asked the middle class for a Contribution, he
promised that 98.8 percent of the country will have no increase in
income tax rates.

“No more something for nothing,” Clinton said. “We are all in this
together."

But the question is: Now that we know what he wants to get us into,
how are we going to pay for it?

For all of the great ideas Clinton spoke of, there is still quite a bit of
mystery as to how all the numbers will add up. Clinton does have the
luxury of being vague, since he doesn’t have to ﬁgure out a budget for
several months and Hillary‘s health plan is still five weeks away. But,
eventually he will have to crunch some numbers, and that may be more
difficult than he seems to think.

Last night's speech was expected to be the grand unveiling of
Clinton’s master plan butamounted to nothing more than a chocolate
coating on _the bitter miracle pill to save our country.

That sweet taste will eventually wear off when Clinton finally gets
down to thespecifrcs of the national budget. Until then, it is still in ques-
tion ivhether or not the country will swallow or spit out that medicine.

An ugly loss  

Things got ugly at Fit’/.gerald Field House Tuesday night.

The Pitt basketball team lost by 25 points, the worst defeat at home
since 1985. But almost as bad, the Panthers and their coach became
part of what waslan embarrassing fracas.

From what Evans, O‘Brien and the players said about the scufﬂing
makes it seem like the Panthers had made a serious faux pas. Evans
still claims that he was justified in his outrage. by the presence of
Boston College starters on the floor when the game was all but over.

At a time when Evans has brought this team to a respectable
national level, acting in such an irresponsible manner takes away
from the accomplishments of this year.

Boston College, which is fighting to get to the NCAA Toumament,
seemed to be trying to_just insure a victory.__The team can’t afford to
take any risks. It didn’t seemed like it was trying to thumb its collec—
tive noses at the Panthers.

It is also hard to understand how Evans could get so angry when
he has blasted previous BC teams by similar large margins.

As embarrassing as this particular defeat was, it was made even
more embarrassing by Evans’ antics and attitude. A little sportsman-
ship would have been nice.

However, according to Pitt point guard Jerry McCullough, the
bloworrt defeat may be a rallying point for the Panthers.

“This game could help us to get our heads together and let us real-
ize that there are still five games left.”

We can only hope so. It would have been the only plus.

Concentrate on present, not past

Oscar Eybers, in the Feb. 16
Pitt News, talks about a new
“black revolution,” which
depends on black Americans
attaining a “full understanding of
their African cultural historical,
and spiritual selves.” As a con-
servative white male, I’ve man-
aged to survive in this world for
2()'years without being tarrght
the history of my German and
Italian ancestry. I don‘t personal-
ly see how tracing African roots
is going to help black Americans
succeed in this country. This is
America, not Africa, or Germany
or Italy. I am not a German-
ltalian—American. I am an
American. So is Mr. Eybers. lfl
studied my nationalities‘ histo-
ries and found that my ancestors
were great rulers of the world, it
still would not help me to suc-
ceed one bit in today’s world.

There is also racism inthis
country against Asians and
Indians, yet they manage to suc-
ceed without having their
minority histories taught in pub-
lic schools. By concentrating on
the past and not the present, Mr.
Eybers is doing himself a disser-
vice. His desire to dwell on the
past and emphasize differences
between black and white will
only lead to more racism.

Athletic priorities skewed
Recently, the athletic depart-
ment held a luncheon/banquet
type ceremony to recognize the
student athletes who achieved a
cumulative GPA of a 3.0 or
higher. I chose not attend for a
very specific reason. Our athletic
department stood by and let two
[suspected] crack cocaine deal-
ers to be reinstated to the foot-
ball team after the police infor-

mant failed to show for the trial.
This was the most outrageous
display of the athletic depart-
ments unscrupulous behavior in
four years here at Pitt.

The athletic department first
offended me when I realized
just how many of the “big
money” sports athletes received
fu-ll-ride scholarships. Take a

the number of full academic
scholarship students you know.
What sense does it make that a
university gives more financial
support to students which
repeatedly show poor" academic
performance then to students
who excel in their studies? The
athletic department I’m sure will
reply that the tremendous rev-
enue which football and basket-
ball bring in more than justifies
this. Let me challenge you to
provide the students of Pitt with
some figures, Oval janes. What
percentage of this money goes
right back into these money
machine sports to keep them
rolling? How much goes toward
the improvement of the univer-
sity? Most importantly, how
much goes to those students
who actually come to Pitt go
learn and excel academically?
How much goes to the student
who actually give a damn?
Perhaps you’ve forgotten the
definition of a university: “an
institution of higher learning
providing facilities for teaching
and research and authorized to
grant academic degrees”
(Webster). Sometimes I see in

the back of a library book “paid
for by the Pitt football team."
Well, I graciously thank you for
your contribution, but it‘s not
enough.

Pitt seems to have lost sight of I
what’s important when it comes ’

to academics. We compromise ,
the very integrity of this "univer- 1..
sity" by allocating "funds to poor tr
. stuclents simply» because. they “

can slam the. sense out..of most
people or put a ball in a basket,
while leaving those students
who came to this university for
its original purpose out in the
cold. \Wl1at price must we pay
for these teams to have a win-
ning record"

It's one thing to practice this
type of academic stagnation
within a university, but to rein-
state two criminals onto an ath-
letic team? Legally, they are not
guilty, but according to the testi-
mony of the unscrupulous infor-
mant who failed to show and
some of their very own team-
mates, they are.

I laugh at the petty recogni-
tion you (Pitt athletic depart-
ment) try to give me for my aca-
demic achievements. My per-
sonal favorites are the extremely
sincere letters congratulating me
for achieving the athletic honor
roll which never get signed, but
are instead left saying, “sincere-
ly,...” I don’t need recognition
from a department of your cal-
iber.

But when the ride is over and

with a harsh reality — top-ranked
Penn State.

Being a decided underdog
against the best team in the nation,
Pitt is ready for the challenge, and
head coach Rande Stottlemyer is
ready to let the “chips fall where

“We respect everybody we wres-

team’s mentality going into the
biggest match of the season. “If you
just wrestled what was on paper
we wouldn't have to show up, but
well show up.

“You don’t mail in the results yet,
you just go out and wrestle,”
Stottlemyer said.

Going out and wrestling the

number-one team in the nation is

_easier said than done. Penn State

won the collegiate dual-meet title

ﬁiback in January and is poised to

win the national tournament title
and claim the national champi-

“Penn State is the cream of the

the Big East championship. It
had defeated a tough, tough
Illinois team at Champaign,
and was seemingly home free
with a pair of tolerable con-
ference matchups at cozy
Fitzgerald Field House.

Then the BC debacle —— a
79-56 blasting, to be brutally
exact -— and all of a sudden
the moniker “sure-thing”
doesn’t sound quite so melo-
dious next to the “Pitt
Panther” nameplate. To make
matters worse, looming in the
distance for the Panthers’
next league matchup is the

Riding the wave of a three-
game conference win streak,
UConn (12-8, 7-6 in the Big
East) has fought its way back

ference loss to Florida State.
With the return of forward
Scott Burrell to the starting
lineup, the Huskies have
demolished Villanova and
Miami at home and are fresh
off their biggest win of the
season — a 80-76 victory at
Syracuse.

For Pitt point guard Jerry
McCullough, the auspice of
confronting a UConn squad
hitting on all cylinders won’t
have any affect on how the
Panthers prepare for the
Saturday night Big East tussle.

“lWe will come out the]

previous games we’ve won,”
McCullough said. “You’re
going to see us come out
strong —- patient with the ball
— and aggressive and in con-

will give him a better seed at

Gibbs is currently seeded 10th in

his 167-pound weight ,¢‘l§_ss',, and

beating Hart would greatly improve -

his seeding as well as his piece of
mind.

“I think about that match con-

match. J

Thinking of the match in anoth-
er way is 126-pounder Ritchey.
Ritchey will return to his home-
town of Connellsville to wrestle the
best competition Pitt will face.

“It will be a sort of homecoming
for Ritchey,” Stottlemyer said. “This
will be a good match for the fans,
and it will take an outstanding per-
formance for us to win.”

If the Pit: fans want to see anoth-

to wait until Saturday. Tonight, the
Panthers take on another solid
team in 17th-ranked West Virginia.

“West Virginia is very tough,"
Stottlemyer said. “We’re right there

Stottlemyer pointed out Matt

1991-The Year Punk Choked ? Or is

By Mike Sula
Sta1TWriter

1991 was indeed the year punk
broke. However, contrary to Sonic
Youth’s Thurston Moore’s vision it
wasn’t broken by a hungry gaggle
of late-blooming indie idols sud-
denly signed to major labels. As a
matter of fact, I broke punk in ‘88,
and nobody has been able to fix it
since. But that’s another story.

Thurston's story, 199]: Ybe Year
Punk Broke is the one that makes
its way to the screen this weekend
several months after it was project-
ed in more fortunate burghs than
this one. That‘s to be expected, for
punk always breaks late in
Pittsburgh.

Anyway, back in the summer of
‘91, Sonic Youth, cresting on the
release of its major label debut
Goo, sailed the ocean blue with
Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr., Gumball, the
Ramones and the Babes in Toyland
for a series of European music festi-
vals designed to inculcate irnpres—
sionable Old Country punks with
the dogma of the New Old Rock.
In tow was filmmaker Dave
Markey, Super 8 to his eyeball, cap-
turing all the magic moments in
black, white and color, enhanced
by lots of other low-budget
schemes. The result was a 99-
minute rockumentary, mockument-
ing the expansion of the next wave
of corporate-fried alternative rock.

Markey is no slouch in temis of
historical filmmaking, being
responsible for Desperate Teenage
Iouedolls. the inspiring manifesto to

all that was pure in the ‘70s, starring
Redd Kross. This time he manages
to preserve the last few unembar—
rassing perfomrances of a number
of swell indie bands on the verge
of really starting to suck.
Remember, this was two months
before “Smells Like Teen Spirit”
made everything stink. At this point
in time the only band in the film
that hasn’t managed to lose any
sense of taste is Sonic Youth, and
its pushing it.

Concert footage of the gigs is
split up by Thurston’s be-bop rap,
directing self-conscious backstage
hi-jinks that establish a se1f—mock-
ing show-biz omnipotence. This
proves, of course, that Sonic Youth
is cooler than Madonna but not as
cool as in the days when Kim
Gordon was really playing bass as
Janice in “The Muppet Show”
house band Dr. Teeth and the
Electric Mayhem. At least, through
all of this, they manage to rational-
ize that despite every band’s major
label status, they are subverting the
entertainment establishment by
exploiting its distribution potential
and sucking up its cash. This must
be what Thurston means when he
talks about “destroying the record
company.” However, I suspect that
beneath all of his heavy elemental
scat, Thurston is just a scared old
man who wishes he was a real
punk, like say, Pittsburgh axe hog,
Ian Williams.

Altogether 1991 is a wacky
behind-the-curtain punkumentary
whose players get to romp around,
acting self—consciously stupid, yet

making everyone else look even
dumber. But then again, not every-
one is privy to insider debauchery
on this scale. It is a loin-tingling
thrill to watch indie idols lurp up
Bob Mould’s poop from a buffet
table.

\Vrthin the riot of crazed camera
angles, shaky shots and home
movie quality, Markey focuses on
the occasional unexplainably
haunting image that remains
burned into long term memory
long after the visual white noise
fades. Glimpses of Kat Bjelland’s
sexful alabaster gams predominate

throughout the Babes in Toyland
segment. Giant gorillas babble
deranged Krautspeak to Kim
Gordon’s Fay Wray. Raw power is

present. At one point, Thurston"

issues a dare to the Bush
Administration and the KGB, and
look what happened to them.
Probably whats most important,
though, are the performances
themselves, and Markey has come
as close to the intensity of live indie
rock swing as possible on film,
with “Expressway to Yr Skull,”
“Freak Scene,” “Dust Cake Boy”
and all of them, damn it. Sadly, this

pure rock blissdom probably won’t
happen again with the likes of
Nirvana, the Babes and Dinosaur
Jr. now that the paranoia control,
mind melt, crass commercial bom-
bastic, anti—individualistic, MSG
slinging, vampires of corporate
alternative rock have sucked the
vital blood from their veins.

With hands still pounding, jazz legend Tyner plays on

ByMike Shanley

Staff Writer

legend has it that McCoy Tyner plays the
piano with such force that the piano needs
to be retumed when he’s done. This alone
proves that Tyner is no ordinary pianist.

When Tyner appears at The Rosebud
this Sunday he will perform alone, some-
thing unusual for a man who usually fronts
a trio or, recently, a big band. But Tynefs
career has gone through many musical
changes, and he has proven himself an
arresting perfomier whether alone. or with
a group behind him.

Born in Philadelphia, Tyner took up the
piano as a teenager. \Y/ithin two years, he
began spending his summer breaks in
Atlantic City, performing with such heavy-
\\'(‘lgjll.\‘ as trumpeter Lee Morgan. After
graduation in 193‘), Tyner moved to New
York (iit_\‘ and played and recorded with
the lienny(1olson_',-\tt l’;rrmei'_l;i/./tet.

Brit T\'ner really made his mark when he
joined tenor‘ saxoplronist John (Iolti'.rne’s
classic (jll:lI’l(‘l in 1960. Along with (ioltrane

and Tyner. the band featured drummer

Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison and
went on to become one of the most impor-
tant and intense groups in jay:/. history.

Coltrane utilized scales and rhythms new
to jazz at the time, like Eastern scales or
modes that set the groundwork for many
of his compositions.

While Coltrane blew long, spiraling solos

and Jones played around the beat rather
than on it, Tyner thundered away on the

When he let loose in a piano solo, his right

hand rapidly flew over high end of the
keyboard while the left hand pounded out
a flury of chords.

Tynefs style, heard on Coltrane albums
such as My Favorite 779r'ngs and A Love
Supreme, became highly popular and inﬂu-
enced many modem pianists.

The pianist looks back on his Coltrane
years fondly. “It was like going to a univer-
sity  he said in a recent interview. “The
music was so glorious. It was unreal.”

Tyner parted with Coltrane in 1965 when
the leader’s music moved toward a rhyth-
mically—free, chaotic sound. Though his
affiliation with Coltrane, who died two
years later, still overshadows the pianist to
this day. his solo career has met with great
success.

Tyner, 33>, has recorded in different situa-
tions on his own. During the ‘7tis he
appeared on Milestone Records and
i‘e<‘ei\'ed two (il"Llllllll§' norninations.

to recording. Tyner has appeared in con-
certs all in the United States, Japan and
Europe. In 1984, he established and per-

The most recent recorded appearance by
the pianist came with tenor saxophonist

and were causing havoc with-
in the techno sub—culture,
long before coming to terms
with their first full-length
effort.

"This is the sound Altern 8,”
say computer—generated
vocals as the first sounds
from the album. This pre-

cedes thefirst 'song,mf‘Move

My Body,” a hardcore deliver-
ance of sound. The title and
the sampled vocals are taken
from a old-disco jam. This is
followed by “Infiltrate 202.” It
begins with a catchy phrase,
an English raver discussing
techno. It’s a slower beat and
more melodic for a hardcore
tune. One of the top songs
from the album is “E-Vapor-
8”. This is what you all have
been waiting for.

“This is the sound of Altern
8,” another catchy phrase, is
used as the introduction.
Contrary to techno norms,
Altern 8 used real vocals, not
a looped sample, on this. The
speed, bass, vocals and an
overload of beats are thun-
der, which equalizes a top
tune.  Revenge,” “Real
Time Status” and “First of
May” are dazed house tunes,
a cavalier attempt to remem-
ber the old sounds that once

assaulted the dance scene.
“Frequency” and
“Armageddon” are pure

Breakbeat shenanigans are
the essences of these song.
“Hypnotic St-8,” another top
jam, lays a compromise
between derived house
melodies and hellfire of tech-
no grunge. The catchiest and
funniest tune is “Activ-8.” It
features MC Crazy Clair, a six-
year—old, and the one respon-
sible for bizarre phrase “Top
one, nice one, get sorted,”
used in the song. The volume
and intensity of the beats are
what makes this one of the
all—time-greatest rave tunes.
“Brutal—8-E” (pronounced bru-
tality) and “Re-Indulge” are
moderate. tunes. “Give it To
Baby” is a nonsense of a
recurring noise, which trans-
late to mean good techno.

Full On  Masle I-lysteria is
14 tracks of ultim8 in techno.
Tired of grunge, shoe-ga'/.ing
and love rock, this is a tem-
porary solution.

Bill Murray ge

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

In (;'rozmcz'bog l)u_i*. Bill
Murray’s self—centered
weatherman gets stuck in a
time warp. He’s forced to
relive Groundhog Day over
and over again until he gets
it right. By the end of the
film, he’s pretty sick of
groundhog day. So was I.

Don’t get me wrong, this
was not a bad movie. I
wouldn’t hold my breath at
Oscars time, but it’s better
than most of the films that
Hollywood tries to pass off
as comedies. The plot is dif-
ferent, some of the situa-
tions are really quirky and
funny, and the one-liners
are excellent. So what's
wrong with it?

The big thing I disliked
about G'r01(n(lbog l)a_)'
was Bill Murray as Phil, the
narcissistic weatherman.
Its not that he gives a bad
performance, its simply that
he doesn't play the charac-
ter of Phil so much as
he adapts the character to
the Bill Murray comic per-
sona. There is little he does
in the film that doesn’t have
a formula feel to it, as
if Murray is simply
rehashing his earlier perfor-
mances. It doesn’t ruin
the film, and Murray is
funny as usual, but his per-
formance is a bit stale.

Bill Murray chases a groundhog, not a gopher in Groundhog Day.

that Murray, :1 Pittsburgh

By Nathan Maynard

For The Pitt News

The lights in the theater go
down as the Twentieth Century
Fox intro music plays. Suddenly,
the entire theater chants in unison,
“A long time ago, in a galaxy far,
far, away, God said ‘Let There Be
I.ips.”' At this, the formerly black
screen displays a set of bright red
lips. No, it isn’t another demonstra-
tioq of virtual reality, you alrave just
paid $3 and found a seat at the
longest running movie ever, 'lhe
Roe/gr’ Honor Pic/I ue Show.

The experience started two
years ago for fIrst—year Pitt student
Jon Muse. “It was right after it start-
ed in Dormont that I started going
to the show," he remembers. Now

it is two years, and quite a few
Saturday nights later, and Jon is still
there. Today, however‘, he doesn’t
only sit in the audience, he has
become one of the regulars in the
floor show. Maybe I should back
up and explain the “Rocky experi-
ence” to those of you who have
never attended.

Back in late September of 1975,
a new and experimental science
fiction movie was released in the
United States. It_ had successfully
run as a stage show in Los Angeles
for over a year, and before that,
the stage version had been per-
formed to packed houses in
England since early 1973. The
movie, however, was considered a
failure and shelved. It wasn‘t until
April Fool's Day, 1976, that the

movie was experimentally shown
at midnight at the Waverly Theater
in New York City. Surprisingly, it
was a success. A small group of
people came to see the movie
every week.

Soon after‘, the magic of Roc/{)2
began. From this loyal group of

, fans, the first audience participation

lines were shouted. From this
point on, lines were chanted from
the audience that responded, or

gave direct,ions, ‘to the c‘lriilratltéfs’ '

on the screen. One of the early
favorites involves the. audience
shouting, to one of the films main
characters, “Say hello Riff!” to
which the character Riff Ralf seem-
ingly responds from the screen,
“Hello.” These lines quickly caught
on and s()on were shouted in the-

aters across the country.

After a while, props were added
‘to the participation. In the first
scene of the movie, Brad and
Janet, the rnovie’s naive couple
who soon stumble upon the
adventure of a lifetime, are attend-
ing a wedding. As the newlywed
couple exits the church, the guests
and the theater audience, begin
throwing rice. By the end of the
scene, theatergoers are picking rice

time of their lives. Other props
include: cards, newspaper, toilet
paper, toast and hotdogs.

By the end of 1977, fans began
to show up wearing the rrrake—up
and costumes of their favorite char-
acters. Not long after, they were no
longer content to sit and watch the

-Dance to the time warp every Saturday with 

movie, shorrting “call-lines” and
throwing props, they stood up in
front of the screen and began act-
ing out the movie as it played
behind them.

This brings us to where we are
today. As of 1987, Sal Piro, presi-
dent of the Roclqv Honor Pictzrre
Show fan club, had seen the movie
over 1,()()() times. Though no one
locally comes close to his record,
there are quite a few people who

’“arel extremely l()yal¥"f() “t*l‘I‘e‘il‘
movie.” It was first shown in
Pittsburgh in 1977 at the Kings
Court Theater in Oakland, now the
site of the Beehive. It ran at mid-
night for over 14 weeks and then
began showing off and on for the
next 1() years. Its most recent stint
began in April of 1988 when it ran
almost every weekend until the
Kings Court closed in spring of
1990.

It wasn’t until after Halloween,
1990, that the Hollywood Theater
in Dormont picked it up. “We
opened to quite a large audience,
about 400 it seemed, a far cry from
the 20 to 7() we performed to at
the Court," said former Ieoclgfir regu-
lar and floor show participant
Stephen Thompson. Attendance is
still strong. Out of over zoo the-
aters now showing the film. The
Hollywood ranks among the top 3
percent in attendance. It is also
one of only four or five tlreateris to
include “Super Heroes." 21 musical
number cut before the 1976
r'ele;Ise.

The person who has been with
the cast the longest is Judi
.\lcHugh. who first went to see the
movie when it was still showing at
the I\'ing‘s Court. and rernar'ks that
things are still running smoothly.

“We pretty nruch run ourselves.
I mean, we work together to cre-
ate cast lists where as it used to be
the directors that made the cast list
based on schedules," she said.

Having been with the show the
longest, Judi has seen the movie
and performed quite often. “I start-
ed out with Magenta, then Janet,
then I played Frank on a ﬂuke,
and I’ve played Dr. Scott, I’ve
played Riff. I think I’ve played
everybody but Eddie.”

Fudge

Continued from page S-3

“Wayside” is an example of
Fudge’s straight—ahead rock,
combining heavy riffs and domi-
nating feedback, along with
fuzzy bass. “Pez” rocks along
with energetic, power-packed
riffs over the melodic harmoniz-
ing of Arnmendolia’s lead
vocals, offset by the backing
vocals and a grungy chorus “I
feel OK, I feel alright,” while an
inﬂux of psychedelia surrounds
Jones’ jangling guitars and
Savage’s syncopated, hammer-
ing drumbeats.

“Astronaut” might be the best
track on the album. A shoegaz-
ing ballad at its melancholy,
romantic best, with guitar echo-
ing subtly beneath the moody,
heavenly vocals. It angstfully
kicks into swirling guitars and
Venable’s heavy bass before set-
tling down again into a subtle

jangle and closing out with a
whirling loop of noisy fuzz gui-
tars. Ammendolia masterfully
maintains control through
tempo and mood changes.
Tremendous.

Overall, Fudge seems to be a
band with refreshing diversity
and originality. That in itself
bodes well for this quartet, even
if it can’t admit to its shoegazing
tendencies. It’s a style of music
seemingly bversaturated
with copycat bands, and Fudge
transforms it with just enough
of its own slant to move listen-
ers.

Check out the caramel-coated
sounds of Fudge tonight at 9 at
the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern.
Also appearing will he

up—and—coming tenor player,
reunited Tyner with his
Coltrane associate Elvin Jones.
They even opened the album
with Coltrane’s complex tune
“Cousin Mary.”

Despite the seemingly con-
stant references to his work
with Coltrane, Tyner is not the
least bit resentful. “I was stig-
matized in a good way,” he
said. “I’m not the kind of
person who rests on their lau-
rels.”

Sunday’s perfonnance ought
to express a side of Tyner not

always heard. His solo album,
Revelations, from 1989 showed
him in a lyrical, gentle mood,
mixing jazz standard with orig-
inal compositions, more
relaxed, yet still intense as
always.

If the album serves as a pre-
view, Rosebud is the place to
be this weekend. Hope they
tuned the piano.

Groundhog

Continued from page S-5

film’s funniest scenes, including a
late—night drive down the railroad
tracks and the kidnapping of
Punxsutawney Phil (played by
Scooter the groundhog). The film is
worth its price for the latter scene
alone —— Murray lets the groundhog
drive.

Next, Murray begins to
change, slowly rebuilding his per-
sonality into a kinder, gentler
human being (what a surprise).
The scriptwriters could have made
this rather formulaic, but it isn’t.
For the most part, the
transitions are fairly unsentimental

and believable, and his wooing
of MacDowell is often funny
(try and keep track of how
often he gets slapped). Remem-
ber, he remembers the day
before, while she does not.
This makes some interesting
situations, as he attempts to learn
everything about MacDowell’s char—
acter that will enable him to win
her and resume a “normal” life. He
memorizes her favorite foods. He
develops an interest in French poet-
ry. And he learns a little about life
as he slowly develops into a differ-
ent person. Murray handles the
character change rather well,

although he looks much like he did
in Scrooged.

The supporting cast plays very
well, especially Elliott and
MacDowell. MacDowell has perfect
timing and reactions as Rita, and
Elliott hams it up rather nicely as
Larry. The townspeople are all well
cast, particularly Stephen
Tobolowsky as Ned the insurance
man. The cinematographers do a
nice job of photographing the look

‘and feel of a small town —— which,

by the way, is Woodstock, I1l., not
Punxsutawney.

I think the writers tried a little
oo hard to add “meaning” to

this romantic comedy (Bill
Murray discovers the meaning
of life while stuck in a time
warp). But the script never gets
too heavy—handed. And it is
consistently funny, which is
hard to do. And the continuity
crew did a fantastic job of making
the entire film look like the same

day.
All in all, this film works well
as a romantic comedy so long as

it doesn’t take itself too seriously.
It’s funny enough to be worth see-
ing, and unusual enough to have
one or two surprises. I’d give it
three stars.

Pitt women's
tennis hosts
Invitational in
spring opener

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis
team blasts off into the spring
season this weekend when it
hosts the annual Pitt Women’s
Tennis Invitational at the
Charles L. Cost Center.

The five-bracket (three sin-
gles, two doubles) individual
tournament will feature players
from Pitt, Duquesne, Akron, St.
Bonaventure and Youngstown
State.

The Panthers have already
defeated Duquesne and
Youngstown State in team
competition during the fall sea-
son,,i‘n which they compiled a
7-3 record. Pitt head Coach

‘A George Dieffanbach said he

plans to use these victories,
among other things, as cata-
lysts for ajgbod performance at
the Pitt Invitational.

“We’ve been working hard
on conditioning, movement
and footwork," Dieffanbach
said. “There are a lot of strong
teams [in the Invitational], but I
think we stand a very good
chance of doing well in this
year’s tournament."

The Panthers will be return-
ing five of their six regular sin-
gles starters from the fall
semester. The only loss is

number five/six singles player.
Carrie Voda, who graduated ,
after the fall season. Her place 3
in the lineup will likely be 4

filled by seldoni-used reserve
Barb McCarthy.

There will also be a change
at the number-three doubles
spot. McCarthy will probably
team with Katie Elliott, who
saw minimal action during the
fall, at the number three spot
for the Pitt Invitational.

The Panthers will once again
be led into battle by senior
number one singles player
Julie Loprinzi, who has been
the guiding force in Pitt’s
impressive fall season. For
Loprinzi and Erika Devins,
Pitt’s nuniber—tliree singles
player and Loprinzi’s partner at
number—one doubles, this will
be their final individual coni-
petition. Both players will
graduate after the spring sea-
son, leaving the Panthers with
a huge void to fill.

“We’ll have a tough task
ahead after Julie and Erika
graduate,” Dieffenbach said.

See Tennis, page 9

 miitnrsdii ‘

ls arry track into Big

    

fate will be in the hands, or
legs, of first-year_ members
like Curtis Anderson, James
Jones and Jay Murphy.

“We got a young team, and
it will be interesting to see
how ’they’ll respond to the
competition which is very,
very good,” head coach John
Vasvary said. “There going to
walk into one of the
strongest, competitive fields
they have seen all year."

(

Murphy, who runs in the
55-meter hurdles, is expected
to fair well for Pitt in the tour-
nament. He ran the fastest
time in the Big East this sea-
son.

Anderson and Jones, both
sprinters, are also expected to

Also, senior Dave Senay and
junior Jim Monk will provide
Pitt with an excellent opportu-
nity to place high in the shot-
put.

“They have been throwing
well all year,” Vasvary said.

This past weekend at“ a
tournament at Robert Morris,
Senay threw the shot 51 feet
to "qualify for the lC4As.

Another promising point for
the Panthers is junior Tim

one of the top pentathlon.

This is not the first time that
Vasvary has coached a young
team.

In fact, he has been quite
successful with youth.

“The last time we had a
team predominantly made up
of underclassmen, [the teaml
ended up fifth, sixth and sev-
enth in the nation,” Vasvary

said about his ‘BS, =

Maybe next week the
Panthers will have similar
prosperity.

-Chris Webber (Michigan) --
The former masked marvel
has played like a superhero
and has lived up to his bill 10-
fold. Not only is he a warrior
under the boards and a high-
tlyer in the open court, he is
one nasty ,r_,11otl1er,__g  
exudes from his lion-sized
heart, while his exuberance
and infectious smile lend a
gentle side to this man-child.
If he learns to move more on
offense, he could be the best
thing to come out of the
motor city since the ‘57 T-
Bird.

-Anfernee Hardaway
(Memphis State) — “Penny”
has lots of skills, and has that
uncanny knack for always
surprising with a creative
move, a gorgeous pass or a
heart-stopping basket in the
clutch. Comparisons to Magic
Johnson haven’t appeared so
unrealistic after all. Minus
power forward David
Vaughn, Hardaway has been
relegated to a one—man show

‘A °:lama'l Mashburn (Kentucky)

—- The Monster Mash is the
most complete scorer in the
land. His “Beauty,” a deadly
three—ball from the perimeter,
and “the Beast,” an unstop-
pable post-up game, make
Kentucky a serious title con-
tender.  _ ’
bell _.  e, baseline.
Mashburn thrives under the
hot lights of a big game, tak-
ing charge of Rick Pitino’s
“NYC South” Wildcats.
-Calbert Cheaney (Indiana)
— should be the first lottery
prize in Hoosier history,
bringing a jumper that finds
the nets like ants rushing to
sweet spilled Hawaiian
Punch. After an above aver-
age ‘92 campaign, Sir Calbert
gives Coach Knight and the
Hoosiers a caliber of player
and athlete that the “Big Red”
has never had stirred into
their type of half court
offense.

more points thus far, and a
career-high 40 against
Georgetown. Possessing the
quickest first step in the coun-
try, and Larry johnsonesque
hops, he can also nail the
three—ball with the best of
them. He has sneaked into
the upper echelon of talent as

vicious as a desert rattler.
-Acie Earl (Iowa) —-— The
reigning king of barren
Midwest farmlands, he is the
apple of every Hawk-eye.
Although his style may be
unorthodox, he’s got lots of
skills, both facing up to the
hoop and with his back to the
basket. The goateed one can
hit his baby jumper over even
the tallest of cornstalks and
intimidate the Grim Reaper
with his nasty scowl.

become the apple of the coach's
eye. His new found confidence
on the offensive end, comple-
ments his cheek—to—cheek defen-
sive mentality. Teammate
Montross turned it on in last
year’s tourney and has proved
this year that you can never
underestimate the power of a
pure big man. He has also
healed that nasty scab that
tainted his shaven head a year
ago.
0(jherokee Parks (Duke) —
Sure he‘s not much flash, but
the burly sophomore brings all
the substance. Awed by step-
ping into Christian Laettneiﬁs

big—time in Duke's two biggest
games of the year. wins o\'er
Michigan and North Carolina.
Deceptively quick and funda-
mentally sound, he is worthy of
the great Blue Devil center tra-
dition.
°l)avid Cain (St. John's) — With
the graduation of Malik Sealy,
Jason Buchanan Rob
Werdann, the Redmen appeared
to be lost without a trace.

Nobody predicted the emer-
gence of Cain as a stellar
playmaker and steely floor gen-
eral, leading Brian Mahoney's
upstart crew to familiar St.
John's turf — first place in the
Big East.
°Ray Jackson (Michigan) —— By
far the most improved of the
Fab Five, Jackson's confidence,
and his skills have increased
tremendously from last season.
The Enigmas:

-Georgia Tech —- Here’s a team
with three all-conference play-
ers, Malcolm Mackey, James
Forrest and Travis Best — one
of the dominant trios in the
land. With Bobby Cremins at
the helm and some capable role

players, Tech
should be at
least a Top-15
team. But like
Pitt, the Jackets
are impossible
to figure.
Remember, this
team lost to the
College of
Charleston at

week after
upsetting
l)uke.

°Nebraska —

State (in Manhattan). So just
when you think Nebraska has it
together, it drops a nationally-
televised home game to
Oklahoma State.

-Iowa State — After giving
Kentucky a tough battle in the
second round of last year's
NCAAs and returning five
starters, Johnny Orr’s Cyclones

as well as both doubles

absent with no excuse last

But after a horrendous losing
streak to start the season and
some cold shooting by main
gunner Justus Thigpen, the
Cyclones have dwindled to a
thunderstomi.

°Antonio Lang (Duke) — If
Duke wants to go for the NCAA
Trifecta, this guy has got to strut
his stuff. The 1990 Mr. Alabama,
he has got Grant Hill-like ability.

was nothing good to say about
about how Pitt played Tuesday
night — except to forget about
it A.S.A.l’.

“The best'thing about lthe

gainel is [that] it's over,” F.vans

said. “We didn't have
very consistent play from any-
body — at either end of the
court.

“We just told the kids in the
locker room ‘forget it, it's
over.’ I remember
Kansas got beat by Long Beach
lStatel and couldn't score St)
points. I said ‘How does that
happen to the niimber-one
team in the nation.’

“You have nights like that,
fellas. And we had one  a
beauty. We're going to have to
regroup and get ready for
Saturday,“ Evans said.

Exel.

°Wake Forest -
Rodney Rogers,

°Florida State —
When healthy,
nobody in
America has more
talent than FSII.
With smooth
shooting from
guard Sam Cassell,
Ward's
quarterback skills at point
guard, and under—publici7.ed do-
it-all man Douglas Edwards, the
‘Noles are good. Throw in the

who crawls all over the glass.
Matt and Pugs’ Favorite
Crawdaddys:

-Bob Sura (Florida State) —— We
like him because he takes the
ball to the hoop fearlessly.
Don‘t let his boyish looks fool

Sweet

you because he plays like a
man. He can also nail the lil-
footer.

°Nick \'an l-Txel (Cincinnati) —
Like Sura, Van F.xel‘s looks are
anything but intimidating. But
he‘ll flat out kill you with light-
ning quickness and a pure scor-
er's mentality.

°Rodney Rodgers — \V’e hate
cliches, but he really is a man
among boys. Built like a Greek
Adonis, this powerful lefty fills
the lane with the best and also
steps out to nail the baseline J.
°Rex \X"alters — Speaking of
cliches. this guy looks like the
All-American kid so much its
nauseating. Can anybody think
of a lefty shooter who can slash
through the lane and has hops‘?
We thought of former l)ookie,
Phil Henderson, but he wasn't
lefty and wasn't as good.

-Vin Baker (Hartford) — First
in the nation in scoring and
12th in rebounding, he's G11“
and can shoot (we love big men
with touch). As a member of the
Hartford Hawks of the North
Atlantic‘ Conference, Baker’s our
favorite player we have never
seen.
