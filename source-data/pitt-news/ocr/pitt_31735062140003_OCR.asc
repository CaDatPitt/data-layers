Forum Presents
Final Discussion

 

Burchard, Hospital Psychologist,
Will Consider “Physique”

Is an individual’s st-atiii'e any in-
dication of his psycliological makeup?
Are short, barrel-chested men or tall,
lean men more susceptible to schizo-
phrenia, deinentia-praecox and nianic-
depressive psychosis? How valid is the
scliizoid-piknoid distinctioii‘?

Such, presumably, will be the ques-
tions considered by E-.ward M. L.
Burchard, psychologist at Torrance
State hospital, who will address the
ﬁnal meeting of the Psychology for-
um, in Room 308 Alumni hall at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon. Mr. Burchard
will speak on “Physique and Psychosis,
the present state of the problem.”

During the course of the semester

the forum, under the chairmanship of
Dr. George Ellis Jones, professor of
psychology, has presented 14 psychol-
ogists who have spoken on topics
varying from an almost philosophical
discussion of “VVhat is intelligence?”
to a highly technical and physiological
study, “The neural coinponents of

the .visua.l response.”

The speakers presented have been,
in sequence, Dr. Max Schoen, Car-
negie Tech; Dr. Norman. L. Munn, as_-
sistant professor of psychology; Dr.
W. '1‘. Root, head of the department;
Dr. G. I. Giardini, Vslestern State pen-
itentiary; Dr. L_a.urence F. Shaffer,

‘My Father Played The Wave
In Count 0fMonte Crista”

 

By Leah Stark

“Buddie came over to my house. I
went over to his. We played together.”
Thus the small, petite Aleen W'et-
stein began her journalistic career,
she said at the Xylon banquet Friday
evening.

Her uncle gave her a diary when
she was ten years old. At that time
she wrote. she said, things like the
above statement which didn’t mean
anything. Now her diary is the source
of many a column theme.

Miss VS/'etstein claims that to be a
successful writer one must be a little
“crazy.” “You must talk to yourself
about the things you did on a certain
day, and by and by, you will have
something. For instance you say, ‘I
went downtown and bought a perfectly
glorious pair of shoes, and walked in
the most gorgeous sunlight, etc.’ You
must keep telling yourself 1ies.”

Many of her anecdotes were taken
from some part of Alexander Wooll-
cott’s life. She tells the story of
Alexander being taken to a movie by
his fa.ther. After the show Alexander
asked his father why a certain man
had walked in without paying. “VVel1,”
his father said, “he is a newspaper
man.” From that day on he set his
heart on being a newspaper man, said
the speaker. " ' ‘

“He had a. uniqué"'way of getting a

job,” nliss Wetstein said. “One uﬁne
day he went to see the wife of the
editor of a New York paper. He told
her that he wanted a job from her
husband. Vvhen he had left the draw-
ing room to put on his snow shoes
in the foyer, she, thinking he ha.d gone,
called her husband and said: ‘I’m
sending a young man down to see you,
and I think he will make a ﬁne news-
paper man because he is the nosiest
guy 1 have ever met.’ ”

She concluded her talk on author
and journalist Vi/oollcott by telling
about his little island on the Hudson
in which six people, including Dorothy
Parker and Harpo Marx, ,each own
one sixth. '

“My father,” she said, “was the
wave in ‘The Count of Monte Cristo,’
when Edmund Dantes jumped into the
sea." James O’Neill, father of Eugene
O’Neill played the lead in the stage
showing.

Most of Miss Wetstein’s work is for
magazines. She says that her col-
umn in the Press is only used for all
her rejections.

“One must wait six years before
realizing an ambition for magazine
work,” she asserted. .

In her “New Yorker” columns she
writes interviews with such people as
Judith Anderson, George Kaufma.n,

Marc ‘ ‘COl5l"Il'()ll:y,‘ ‘and ' or ‘-course -—“A1_exan-w

Countries Must
Work Together,
James Declares

No Nation Can Claim To Be Free
Of International Contracts,
Professor Tells Seminar

By Joseph E. Rosenberg

The student who views history in
peispective cannot avoid the con-
clusion that some sort of internation-
al organization is inevitable, said Dr.
Alfred 1-‘. James, professor of history
and retiring president of the social
science seminar, at the last nieetiiig
of the seininar Fi_'ida.y.

Speaking on “Iiiteriiational organi-
zation in a planned socit-t),',” D1‘. James
declared that educators must tackle
the problem in order to overcome the
lead weight of the traditional nation-
alistic sentiinent and patriotism which
is the greatest barrier to international
cooperation.

“No nation, not even the United
States, which is avowedly isolationist
in its policies, can claim to be free
-of international economic and political
contacts,” he said.

“However, such contacts without
systematic arrangements are like the
human body without an articulating
skeleton. In the foreign relations de-
partnients of goveriinieiits and in the
League of Nations and World Court,
we have already set up the leg‘islati.ve,
judicial and administrative machinery
De(".eSS.':Il'jv'.

Discarding the clii.mei'ical world
state and the ineffective loose con-
federation as inadvisable, Dr. James
held that a'world federation must
take it if it is to be successful. Under
such a federation there would be
joint action in all matters that con-
cerned every nation and individual
action in problems involving only one
nation. 1.))‘. James also believes that
a federal l'orm of government would
parallel the history of the United
States in becoming more and more
centralized and uniﬁed.

The speaker dismissed the argu-
ment of national loyalty by saying:
“VVe have permitted nationalisin to
swallow up greater loyalties——to fam-
ily, to humanity and to God.”

Before the presidential address. the
seminar elected the following officers
for the coining year: Dr. Oliver L,
Reiser, associate professor of phil-

osophy,  pi'esid‘€ilt;""lT)r;' Asher‘ Is”aaf‘s."

assistant professor of economics, sec-
retary; and Dr. Verne C. VVright, as-
sistant professor of sociology, program
chairman.

Roll in 0%,;-(Ere
For Marine Post
During Summer

“I may be on anything from ship-
board duty to rebellion duty in Nic-
aragua to legation duty i.ii. Peiping,‘-"
said George Roll, C35, and cadet
colonel of the ROTC, concerning his
selection by the military unit here to
compete for a. vacant second lieu-
tenant’s commission in the U. S.
Marine Corps.

Some time this summer Roll will
go to Philadelphia to complete an ex-
amination. in the first part of which
—the physical examination———lie has al-
ready passed. If'lie passes, he will
attend the Marine training school, re-
ceiving his commission about Septem-
ber 1.

Recently a number of vacancies oc-
0“1’1'ed am0I12-E cominissioned of-ticers
in the Marine corps. Heads of mil-
itary units in schools throughout the
country were asked to select senior

vacancies.

SFA Elects Six

Executive

 

Chairman Lauds
‘Merit System’
In Appointments

Assemblies, Class Audit, Dances,
Newsreels Featured Activity,
Outgoing Lead.e'r Reports

Featuring the ﬁnal Uni\-'e1'Si*-Y AS-
seinbly meeting Friday evening was
the report on the 1934-35 S14‘.-X activ-
ities by Leonard H. Marks, C35, chair-
man of the outgoing Executive coin-
mittec.

“Our first and greatest. task was re-
vision of aclininistintive procedure,”
said Marks. “in taking over the func-
tions of the deceased Student Couli-
cil, we were primarily concerned with
formulation of rules and setting up
new iuacliinery. »

"One of the most troubling of all
questions in previous student activi-
ties was the selection of class (lance
chairman. I am happy to say that
the merit system of appointment in-
troduced has functioned admirably and
I heart.iI.y recommend its continuance
for the following year. To prevent the
charges of po.itical. partisanship and
inadequate consideration, this ari'a.nge-
ment is absolutely vital.”

In regard to the constitutions coni-
mittee, which was active this year in
bringing about proportional repre-
sentation of women and other refornis,
Marks declared, '‘'Change is not to be
feared, but irrational change and haste
in altering. established practice are
not always advisable. Amendments
should conform to sentiment of cani-
pus groups."

The ill-fated newsreel venture,
which lasted three weeks, received
the retiring chairman's praise. “It is
strongly felt,” h.e asserted, “that the
showings deinonstrated the genuine
valuevof" supplementing "classroom" ed-
ucation. It is hoped that the shows
can be revived next year with a
smaller ﬁnancial outlay.” ;

Marks cleared up a question which
has been lia.ngin_:, lﬁre for some time
when he added, “The new Cathedral
lounge will be completely equipped
and opened by September. Mr. Weber
has assured us that this will be a coin-
ll'l0(ll.0llS ineetiiig place.”

The innovation of including faculty
members in student government. was
lauded. “Throughout all the work of
the association there has been a close
relationship between students and
faculty. I feel sure that those mem-
bers who have participated. in com-
mittee work have found their faculty
associates indispensable.”

“The scope of your work,” the presi-
dent concluded, “is unlimited. It is the
pliilosopliy of the univei‘sil:y adminis-
tration to give to the students as inucli
power as they can handle.”

A survey of SFA.’s activities in its
first year shows the following proj-
ects:'

Rushing Revision
Before l‘-ll‘ Body

Code Committee To Submit Plans
For Early Rushing Period

 

 

Vfhether nienibers of next year’s
freshman class are not only subjected
to customs, as SFA, plans, but also to
a. concentrated period of rushing by
fraternities almost inimediately after
the Registrar’s staff stamps the regis-
traring equivalent of “Okay” on their
inatriculation cards, may be decided
tomorrow night.

A special meeting of Interfraternity
Council has been called by President:
Edward Durkin, C36, for 6 o’clock at
the Pi Lambda Phi house to discuss
rushing plans for the coming year.

CPSF, which led its own way into
oblivion by establishing an I-F Council
here, considered a thorough change in
rushing procedure for next year at
meetinss over the last few months.

He-m‘:~' George, M36, chairman of a
rushing code coniiiiittee, submitted a
plan originally calling for the begin-
ning of rushing in the fall on the first
Monday of the semester, with two
periods of rushing employed. Tlile
-first, a semi-.I'est2‘icted period, would
limit each house to entertaining in-
dividual fresliman only once over three
days. Following the restricted period
would be an open season in which the
lower regions’ monarch could take
the hindmost.

Also included in the sample code
was provision for a freshman ban-
quet, in which the values of frater-
nity membei'ship- would be extolled.

Individual houses vetoed the re-
striction arraiigenient: and matters
stand now with an open season sched-
uled for the very first week of the
seinester, on a Thursday.

Tomorrow niglit’s meeting should
clarii'y the situation. ‘

About Dances And

Stud And Things

including N o Remarks On The Cosmos

 

By lgor

On Friday night, when Russ Lyon’s
NBC orchestra gave its interpretation
of “Hail to Pitt" to close the Senior
Ballfaii elaborate program of dances
for the year came to its ﬁnale.

It was a good dance as dances go;
it was remarkable in one other re-
spect.

Advertised as “The Senior Ball" it
i-ezil.ly strove to carry out its name.
‘For the ﬁrst time in inodorn Univer-
sity history, a special effort, was made
by Chairman Don Campbell and his
coiiiniittee to have seniors particular-
lv attend the affair. That was some-
thing new around these parts.

Ever since you and I can remem-
ber, he same people have been at-
ieziding every University (lance, re-
,-;az-dless of which class, group or in-
ierest was dominant on the com-
mittee.

Think over the crowd at the Soph
Hop and you’ve remembered almost
to a poison those present at. the
Junior Prom. The Freshman dance
uiid the Spring Festival affair had
practically the same list of patrons.
And that list, with all efforts to do a

bit. of stretching, approximates no
more than about 300 couples.
2*?-aw the Uni‘vei'sity bulletins and

advertisiiig iinply that at "Pitt are nigh
onto 12,000 students. Slough oil 3.iJUtl.L
4.1100 or so in professional schools and
off-campus centers, and, by simple cal-
culus, the answer approaches 8,000.
'.l‘ake- away the women, who sellzloni
buy the tickets any way, and we have:
close to 4,500 men who are campus
students. A.nd a Uiiiversity dance, if
it. draws 300 couples, is styled a. “suc-
cess."

To mix metaphors and reaclers both,
one might say all that glitters may
have a few half-hitches in it some-
where. ‘Which brings us down to the
Senior Ball.

The committee went after seniors
l1:ii.ni_ner and glove. Seniors were made
to feel, for the first time, that be-
sides the fact that only members of
their class were on the committee, it
was a Senior Ball in all respects.

Other class dances-, this ‘year or
any year, had members of the. appro-
priate classes on the staffs and
stopped being representative at just
that point. Any one was invited, which
was good enough, but sophomores
weren't pestered particularly that the
Soph "Hbp was their hop, juniors
wei-en’t impressed that the Junior
Prom was primarily for them. What's
the odds?

it all boils down to one thing. The
people whom our dances should reach
the students to whom dances might
meaii something, are entirely ig-
nored.

Joe W'hoozis—who comes to Pitt

and that's about all—if he's a soph-
omore, should be pressed to attend
the Soph Hop. Dances here are aimed
toward furthering the social life of
the students generally. Vi/hen they
merely concern those few with extr-.-i
spending money. who, if there was no
school dance scheduled a. certain eve-
ning, would get their dancing in at
night clubs of varied convert charges,
somethings radically wrong some-
where.

To get Joe VVho0zis and his babe to
his class dance, a new era must evolve,
C:-inipiiell heralded it. somewhat by
slashing Senior ‘B-all rates from $5.50,
$3.30 and other past rates, to $2.25,
truly an advance. in enlightenment. A
new day must dawn and, perhaps, it
is up to the august SFA Assembly to
do the something about it.

That “cheap” dances will draw
otherwise iion-daiicing students is a
definite fact. Many can 1‘elllenli)f31‘ the
great Spring Festival dance of two
years ago, when more than 600 couples
thought it worth $1.50 per to attend
a University affair. And at that mere
(compared to other dance dates)
$1.50 per, patrons heard two good
bands battle it out in music. receiverl
nice progranis and a. “Razz Ri-Lg,” and
so much proﬁt was still made that all
exp-eiises of the Fesi.ival lVeek (and
there are lots of them) were covered
by the affair.

Imagine a Junior Prom at $1.50 or
.$2~—with a good band. a large ﬂoor
and no waste of money on favors. Joe
VVlioozis. now a ,'ll1lllOI‘, would like to
attend that affair, the same as Joe
Wlioozis did consider the Military
Ball worth $3, and turned out along
with 1,499 other Joe "Whoozises.

Is our social program aimed, as we
licpe, towards doing the most good
socially for the greatest number, or
must we continue to go through col-
legiate life with dances for the "for-
tunate 300, and with 4,200 other men,
who'd just like to go to Pitt dances
.‘ke everything, completely ignored in
the box score?

Model u..;§~;.z.z,.

Teddy does not chase the birds,
does not gallop away when you try
to pet him, and gets along ﬁne with
Dr. F‘ergus0ii’s pussycat, ism. I-Ie eats
anything you give him and, says Mrs.
Foster, Heinz House cook, is in all
ways a inorlel dog and different from
any other dog or cat she ever had.

’l‘eddy’s immediate predecessors
were Fifty-Paws, the cat who was over-
fond of birds, and Jerry, the dog
who despised all cats and died of
nothing more serious than old age.

Teddy is a black and white fox-
terrier. “Well, no,” says Mrs. Foster,
“he isn’t exactly pedigreed, but any-
way he's a good dog.”

Tlicrc

I on n pi-oniisc

aside, I think I liave received 21 lib»:-‘ral
education at Pitt. Most of my pro-
fessors are men whom I have liked
and respected.
and their ideas
have been stimu-
lating. Some of
them are whim-

tives, some equal-
ly whimsical lili-
erals, others
s t r ai ght - from-
tlie-slioulder pro-
gressives. Some
are mystical opti-
mists, some plain-
tive pessimists,
others, as it were,
clear-headed realists. Some are scin-
tillating lecturers, some droning read-
ers, others inforinal conversational-
ists, One or two are, it seems to be,
complete men who have lived richly
and well. .

From the standpoint. of:tlie class-
room, the above description may in. i-
cafe what 1 nieaii by a liberal educa-
tion. As a typical student I have
come under the influence of strikingly
different men with slzrikingly dift'ercnl'.[
philosophies. That I have receive-di
more from some is only natural. But 7
the value of the whole experience is
that I have had the opportunity to
know and listen to them all. This I
should call an important part of a. lib-
oral education.

Equally as important have been ....
sociations with other students. Col-
lege people have their pet l'iypoci'is-
ies, their little meannesses, their prej-
udices. and their good intentions--
just as everybody has. VVith the wide-
ly-publicized freedom of youth, how-
ever, they are not quite so i'esei'ved
about saying what they think. ‘Nliile
some are budding politicians an--d pub-
lic rel:-i.tion.s men, most of tlie-m a.i'es
not versed in the art of dissizriulaiion.
They unburden thcniselvos of ideas
they are not yet too vain to admit
as inclioate. and ti.i.e_v will tell you
pretty deﬁnitely what they think of
you and your ideas. And while sin-
cerity is a virtue which may occasion-
ly overdo itself, I think it has a very
-nroﬁt-able place in undergraduate
life.

Among the students I have grown to
lrnow this virtue.  r;arel,v been lack-
ing. VVe have talked a good deal.
attempted to thresh out ideas on vital
rluestions, and 1 am inclined to be-
lieve. not tried to kid each other——t.oo
much. And in this case again. I have
knocked up against varied points of
view and dissimilar personalities. Es-
pecially, I have become acquainted
with a. few students whose association
I shall regret losing. This also, to me,
is signiﬁcant in a liberal education.

The third element, probably mainly
from the other two, is the combined
force of disappointments. enthusiasm,
shocks, and pleasures of four years at
a university, which should help to ma-
ture the normal individual, One may
experience all these emotions outside
of school, and b.e undoubtedly does,
but at an institution of higher edu-
catioii with its comprehensive social
and activities ‘Dl‘(‘._9,T?.fl1 and superior
contacts, the r.il)si,acl.°s and goals are
broader and more varied.

I am ufrairl tliat this observation is
vague and not at all concrete. ’I‘o be
imore explicit: Outside the university
§i.he world of the yoiith is apt to be
"rather narrow. There may be a few
friendships, a job, a church organiz2-.-
V lion, a club or two. At the university
lthere are dozens of org‘-ani..ai’ions of-
‘-fering outlets for all kinds of aspira-
tions, political, social, intellectmil. In
each of these are factors. which knock
him around a bit, encourage him. al-
low him to make. discoveries about
himself. And out of these develop the
(lllfllities which belong to one’s lib-
oral education.

All of what I have been groping so
painfully to say may be summed up
in this: I think Pitt has given me a
liberal education. All sorts of profes-
sors have supplied me with all sorts
of ideas and stirred up a few of my
own. All sorts of students have
chewed a pretty sincere rag with me
to my, and I hope. their advantage. And
the arfivities I have participated in
have. again I hope, matured me slight-
ly. There I consider a liberal educa-
lion.

Michelosen Leads Hitters

"‘Well, it's just Kappa Sigma’s year,.

other Delt as the Kappa Sigs captured
their fourth straight athletic title in
Greek competition. It was the
mushb-all championship this time, as
Delta Tau Delta lost by a 10-6 count.

Both teams showed plenty of scrap,
and were even a little nervous, fumb-
ling slow-bounding grounders and
high ﬁles. Kappa Sigma was ahead
all the way, scoring two in the ﬁrst
inning, three in the second, one in the
third, three again in the ﬁfth and
one in the seventh and ﬁnal frame.

Beachler, Winning hurler, limited
the Delts to ﬁve blows. Shaky ﬁeld-
ing in the sixth, when Mahoney drop-
ped a high fly and Garner bobbled
two grounders at short, coupled with
:2 single by Allcroft and a double by
lleburn, sent three runs across the
plate.

Michelson was the leading slugger,
getting a. homer, double and single in
four times at bat. Nate Hepburnhit
two of the Delt blows. The Kappa
Sigs play the upper-bracket leaders
in the Intramural title tomorrow.
Delta Tau Delta plays the runner-up
in that section for third—place medals.

Kapp Sigma thus added the first

No Recount, Just A Review
Of Carnivals Track Meet

 

Johnny Wood And Charley G-i~o‘at Are Still The Leading
Point-Getters In Fraternity, Independent Track

- ...___.,._.

Wliat the Mzuldens are to tennis~-
are the Croats to lrack‘.

E‘-.1.-’liile brother Charley was out crack-

ing the exisiing collegiate lialf-inile

a.nr.l relay records, Marty Groat has al-
so been doing his part to keep up the
track tradition in the Grout faniily.
On Wednesday, Marty paced Kappa
Sigma to victory in the Spring Fes-
tival track meet with firsts in the
quarter and high jump, in addition to
:1 second in the 220, and running lead-
off man on the championship 440-yard
relay team.

Sweeping ﬁrsts in six of the 11
events, placing second in three and
third in two more, Kappa Sigma. piled
up a new high-point total of 41.

Delta Tau Delta with 251/2 markers,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon with 201/2,
were runners-up, receiving the second
and third place trophies, respectively.
Last year’s ﬁrst place trophy win-
ner, Phi Gamma Delta, minus the
services of its one-man track team,
Bobby La Rue, was back in fourth
place with Phi Kappa, scoring six
points apiece.

The weather Vvednesday was ideal
for the record-cracking efforts of
Groat, Wilkins and VVood, the big
noise from the Independent entries.
Marty Groat, Kappa Sig, was high-
point leader for the Greeks with a
total of 14%. Marty lowered Charley
Martin’s 57 seconds 440-yard record
to 54 seconds ﬁat. He also cleared the
bar in the high jump at 5 feet, 9 in-
ches and registered a second in the
220-yard dash in addition to leading
off on the Kappa quarter-mile relay
team, winner of this event.

Johnny W'ood, Panther gridder, also
turned in a fine individual perform-
ance, taking ﬁrsts in the 100 and 220-
yard dashes and the baseball throw
to earn three Intramural awards. His
330-foot heave in the baseball throw
eclipsed the former record of 324 feet,
set by Haverty last year.

VI-’ilkins also took a crack at the

records by pushing the shot 47 feet -

1 inch. Dutlinger, SAE, was right on

Groat’s heels for the individual title, E

registering 131/2 points. He broad-
jumped 19 feet, pole-vaulted 10 feet
and took a dirst with Ruhe in the
three-legged race, plus a third in the
high jump.

The Kappa Sigma tug-of-war team,
composed of Morrow, Delich, Hensley,
Parks, Golmar, Garner, Hood and Mi-
chelosen, defeated the indoor champs,

Trolley Company
Makes Decision
For Sessertaro

It was all the fault of the street
cars. Now Sessertaro, freshman de-
bating unit, will probably wait until
after examinations to prove to \Vest-
inghouse students that the movies do
more harm than good. Florence Hill-
er, BA, and Leah Hirsch, C, had had
everything arranged for a trip to VVest-

Adele Norkas, Ed36; umbrella

inghouse High school last Thursday,
in which they were to defend the
negative side of the movie question
against Vvestinghouse debaters.

“But,” explains Miss Hiller, “we got
on an 88 street car that was going
this way instead of that way, and we
told the conductor to call out when
we got to Murtland and Frankstowu.
The car never got to Murtland and
Frankstown. Of course we could have
had the debate on Friday, but one of
the Vvestinghouse affirmative team
has a typewriting class on Fridays
that he's got to attend, because he
ought to flunk and hopes he won’t.”

So Sessertaro had to be content with
debating Vvestinghouse just once, re-
ceiving only their negative team here
on F'1'iday.

 

Junior Women Win First
Place In Swimming Meet

The junior women's class emerged
victorious from the interclass swim-
ming meet sponsored by VVAA with

Eleanor Fedigan, C37, won ﬁrst in
the 40-yard crawl with two freslnnen,
Helen Kulick and Lois Joyce taking
second and third. The 40-yard back-
stroke was taken by Lois Follansbee,
C37, with Betty Mulholland, C38, sec-
ond. In the other races the women
placed as follows: 40-yard breaststroke,
ﬁrst, Ruth Anderson, Ed36; second,
Annetta VVardley, Edi-35; balloon race,
ﬁ.rst, Margaret Cummings, Ed35;
dressing race, ﬁrst, Anne Yargots,
E'd36; second, Miss Cummings; third,

man, took ﬁrst in the diving event,
with Bernice Simpson, C37, second.

To Sing Tonight

Applique Hanging To Be Shown
At Tea Following Program

   

Tonight at 8:30 o’clock, on the
thirty-sixth floor of the Cathedral, the
Carpatho-Russian symphonic choir of
Pittsburgh, under the direction of the
Rev. Mr. Michael Staurovsky, will pre-
sent a program of choral singing for
the beneﬁt of the Russian nationality
room in the Cathedral. This chair won
the cup at the Festival of Choruses in

Easter cycle, by Tschaikovsky, Archan-
gelsky, Rimsky-Korsakoﬁ and other

stitute the first group. Choral num-
bers of asecular nature and folk songs
will comprise the second group.

will be served in Room 1309, Cathe-
dral. Here the “Vishivka,” a decora-
tive needlework, executed in the tra-
ditional Russian technique of em-
broidery and applique work and com-
posed of fabrics of considerable an-
tiquity, will be shown for the uﬁrst
time. The hanging, which was worked
by Mrs. Helen Viner, sister of Igor
Sikorsky, airplane designer, portrays
St, George and the Dragon as a sym-
bol of youth victorious over evil. It
will be hung in the Russian room in
the Cathedral when completed.

The patronesses for the affair are:
Mrs. D. M. Clemson, Miss Mabel L.
Gillespie, Miss Eleanor Grier, Mrs.
