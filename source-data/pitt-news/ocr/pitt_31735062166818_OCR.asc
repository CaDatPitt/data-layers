University Participates S, G, Passes Bill Qb

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

In Classified Research
Of Arms Development

by JAMES G. HOLLAND

Associate Professor of Psychology
at the Unz'1.>m‘sity _ .

The University partici-
pates in classiﬁed research.
Some of us became interest-
ed in the extent of the Uni-
versity involvement when
an article in the New Repub-
lic «listed the University as one
of the universities participating
in chemical and biological war-
fare research. Our Washington
office, housing the University of
Pi-ttslburgh Ordinance Research
staff, participates in such work.

fro-m the Technical Abstract

Bulletin, published by the De-

fense Documentation Center, il-

lustrates classiﬁed work.

In -a single year (1966) the
Technical Abstract Bulletin list-
ed 98 titles of ordinance reports
for two projects in the Wash-
ington office. Of these, 39 are
classiﬁed; the list includes such
titles as “Antipersonnel Mine
Dispenser, XM3,” classified con-
ﬁdential, “Fuze, XM1140, for
Missile Nuclear Warheads,”
classiﬁed secret, and “Tactical
CS Canister Duster, E 159: Dis-
pensing a Benevolent Incapaci-
tor.”

Ctlassiﬁed or not, it seems
strange for a university to par-
ticipate in the writing phase of
ordinance research in this man-
ner. While one can quibble over
the meaning of the word re-
search, most researchers consi-
der publication of the ﬁnal
phase of -the work and, in the
work «of large team efforts, in-
terim reports to communicate
with other members of the team
an integral part of research
planning. To say th-at “they just
put (the Army's) information
into English” does an injustice
to those at the Washington of-
ﬁce.

earned through years of dedi-

not do “just editorial” work, but
that it prepares interim reports
to speed up the weapon devel-

compilations like the classified

gether information from a. va-

needs of the military.

To $1 5 Course Change Fee

by PAUL STOLLER

Next term, there will be
a $15 registration late fee.
The late fee date, has been
moved back from the first
day of the winter term (Jan.
8) to Jan. 17.

This action was taken in re-
sponse to a Student Govern-

ment (SG) bill condemning the
“harsh change of course fee.”
The bill, unanimously passed
Wednesday night, had been un-
der administrrative consideration
for a number of weeks.

The bill concerns itself with
more than a mere condemna-
tion of the change of course fee.
It reﬂects the entire condition

Oakland Community Co-op
Hosts Concert Tomorrow

_ by IVAN ABRAMS

The Oakland Community Cooperative will sponsor a
jazz concert tomorrow at 8:30 pm. featuring the New Jazz
Ensemble of Pittsburgh to be held at the Bellefield Church.
Admission to the concert is $1. per person or $1.50 per cou-
ple. The concert is designed to raise funds for the estab-
lishment of the Co-operated Community Center.

The organ.iza'.:ion, established by members of the University
community to enable ir;.d.ividuals to have a measure of control in
their economic, social, and cultural affairs, has recently been grant-
ed non-profit corporation status by «the State of Pennsylvania.
Within the next month its members plan to begin not only the
Community Center but also a food cooperative, in which mem-
bers can purchase dry goods and meat at substantial discounts.

“This,” according to Advertising Chairman Keith Bromberg, “will --

allow students, faculty, -and -area residents to escape from the high
prices and dubious quality of Oakland supermarket merchandise
while at the same time demonstrating that cooperation is more

worthwhile than competition.”

There is also a possibility that milk will be sold at a discount.
Ernest Hvayes, president of the United Dairy Farmers, has tenta-
tively indicated his willingne-ss to establish a branch of his grvonup’s
milk cooperative in conjunction with the Oakland food co-op.
Hayes will speak at the group’s next meeting at Belleﬁeld Church,

Thursday at 8 p.m.

According to Bromber, other topics to be discussed at next
week's meeting are the speciﬁc procedure for buying food, the
possibility of establishing a book cooperative and art cooperative,
and an investigation into the feasibility of cooperative housing.

“Since our ﬁrst meeting in someone’s apartment two months
ago,” says Bromberg, “the cooperative has grown fantastically.”
He adds that there have been difficulties encountered, chieﬂy in
-time lapses with items such as leases and building permits, but
all problems seem to be solved by this time.

Bromberg declares that “when students return from Christ-

- ‘mas vacation, they can expect to ﬁnd a fully operative co-onp, ready

to beneﬁt them as so-on as they join”

Paul Krassner Speaks

of the University's present reg
istration system. —.

Senator Vic Willem, sponsor
of the bill, objected to the
change of course fee because
“no students took part in the
decision. Under present system,”
added Willem, “the function of
the student advisor deterior-
ates. In short, the fee is a. cov-
er-up for an inadequate regis-
tration system.”

The registration problem is
one of conditions presently exist-
ing. “Mr. Smith, vice chancel-
lor fo-r ﬁnance, is aware of the
poorness of the registration sys-
tem,” according to SG Vice4pres-
ident Tom Meisner. “Many stu-
dents do not know who their
professors will be when they
sign u.p for courses. Also, many
invoices are sent out quite late,”
added Meisner. “All of this adds
to the registratiion problem.”

SG also passed a bill concern-
ing entertainment. The bill stip-
ulated the following:

> The selection of entertain-
ment is greatly improved when
considered far enough in ad-
vance of an event.

_> The University Calandar is
drawn u:p when Homecoming
and Winter Weekend -will be
the following year.

> Therefore, the chairmen for
Homecoming, Winter Weekend,
and Parent's Weekend should
be nominated by the second
meeting of the newly _ elected
Senate.

Senator George Doperak in-
troduced a. bill calling for great-
er police protection on campus.
“The situation on campus has
recently become much Worse
than it has ever been. Many
cars, for example, have been
stolen in the campus area,” stat-
ed Doperak.

Doperak’s bill calls for an
“increase in -the police protec-
tion both by the University PO-
liee and the City Police. The
bill was passed by the Senate.

Exposes Hypocracies of American Life

by H0nsART HARRIS .

Paul Krassner eats chick-
en with his hands. This is
unique. As a matter of fact,
Krassner is probably the on-
ly person in the history of
the Student Union Board

‘PAUL KRASSNER
Speriks at idday

I .

 

  

Lecture Series that eats chick-
en with his hands. This is, in a
sense, a tribute to’ Kra.ssner’s
qualifications as a social com-
mentator. Saga prepares the
chicken that is served at the
Student Union Lecture Series

banquets.
Krassner was no-t the nor-
mal type of Student Union

speaker. He didn't wear a tie
and jacket, he was young, his
taxi was in an accident on the
way to the airport this morn-
ing. What Krassner is is an
articul-ate thorn in the side of
people like the New School, the
President, and David Susskind:
“I had a pre-interview with Da-
vid Susskind before his show
once. He wouldn't let me on. He
was basically running Ia freak
show and he discovered that I
was too articulate.”

Krassner, editor of the Realist
magazine, titled his talk “The
Truth is Silly Putty.” “That

makes it just vague enough to

let me speak about anything,”
he pointed out. His words seem-
ed to be designed n-ot so much
to tell people something, but to
get them to think the way Paul
Krassner thinks, if only for a
little while.

Krassner had the unique abil-
ity to look at something and
make it look preposterous, judg-
ing by the reactions of the audi-
ence. What was important to
Krassner was not so much what
is said but how it is -said, how
people think about things.

Krassner began h:is talk with
an aside about a libel trial he
had been in. “The ﬁrst time I
wore a suit and tie was at my
libel trial,” he said, referring to
his sweatshirt and Levis. “I
guess I didn't have faith in the
issues in the case. After t-hat,
swearing on a Bible would al-
most have been anticlimatic.”

However, Krassner’s ordeal
wasn't over yet. “Then the op-
posing. attorney asked me if I

   

was an atheist. It would look
bad if I said ‘no’ after swearing
on a Bible, but it would look
worse if I retracted . . .”

Krassner turned his wit to
pop music next. “Older people
are disturbed because the hip-
pies are having too much fun.
Take “The Rolling Stones” Let’s
Spend the Night Together was
compared to Frank Sinatra’s
Strangers in the Night. S~tra.hg-
ers was about a casual pickup,
while the ‘Stones’ sang about
something that might have been
a love relation. ‘Boots’ was a
sadomasochistic -story.”

Krassner ended his speech
talking about the war. “The
credibility giap has become a
credibility chasm,” he said. “We
have to continue the bombing
because we have to deal with
the anti aircraft. People think
that God is on ou-r side. If so,
he went to the highest bidder.

Since the faculty began dis-
cussion of classiﬁed research,
one of the -two contracts sup
porting the Washington office
was not renewed. The other,
however, remains. In addition,
the University has another clas-
siﬁed project for the -testing of
!bomb release mechanisms and,
until recently, had two other
class-iﬁed projects.

Compared with many institu-
tions, the University does have

relatively little classiﬁed re-

search. The predominant senti-
ment among faculty and admin-
istration is that secrecy is out

A of keeping with the nature of

the University as a. place for
free, disinterested discussion,
discovery, and the dissemina-
tion of knowledge. The discus-
sion among the faculty is not
on these principles, but on

, whether principle should be set

aside in certain cases.

An additional question is one

of civil liberties and academic

freedom. Participation in classi-
ﬁed research involves the ne-

—cessity -of a ‘government secur-

ity clearance. Thus, personnel

. can be added to the staff of a

classiﬁed project -only if they

’ can qualify for security clear-

EH95 ﬁiiil ‘.?.i:‘b'é Wﬁliiig 156 Sign ‘a
loyalty oaith.

In addition, members of the
administration cannot properly
perform their -duties if their
subordinates are participating
in classiﬁed research unless they
themselves have security clear-
ance so that they may have ac-
cess to their wo-rk and review
contract appliicaitions for approv-
al. This gives government se-
-curity agents power to inﬂuence
the composition of the universi-
ty’s administration. At the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, which
recently rid itself of clais-siﬁed
research, 26 members of the ad-
ministIraiti»on needed security
clearance to perform their ad-

- ministnative duties.

It is fortunate that this Uni-
versity, at the present time, has
so little classiﬁed work. Many,
such as Stanford, the University
of Michigian, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Cornell, all
of whom have either recently
gotten rid of classiﬁed research
or are in the process of doing
so, had millions of dollars of
classiﬁed Work. It should be
easier tor the University.

Editorial: The Road to Obscurity?

The agonizing waiting period that our University has been forced
to endure due to the state's failure to pass our appropriations raises seri-
ous questions concerning the future of this institution. One cannot, in all
honesty, dismiss‘ the appropriations stalemate as a political hassle that
will never reoccur. For this is the second year that the State Legislature
has argued over ﬁnances that directly concern the University.

Last year we did not receive our state-related status until August,
barely meeting the deadline for lowering tuition for the Fall Term. We
ﬁrmly believe that fche main reason that we met that deadline was that
last year was an election year, and the Governor and all of the state legis-
lators were running for office. If they had not been able to agree on the
vital issues last year, their constituents would have had the opportunity to
voice their displeasure. This past year no such satisfact-ory outlet existed.

This year the University has been forced to borrow several million
dollars to meet its operating expenses, as we sit back and view the endless
bouts-our Governor and legislators engage in Harrisburg. As We pointed
out previously, this state of affairs breeds an insecurity and instability
that cannot be denied. If we are forced to worry about the funds required
to run this institution and are continually besieged with rumors such as
that of a tuition hike, how can we move in other directions? It's fine to be

idealistic and to talk about building a great university, but the pragmatist
in us wonders how we can move beyond the mundane if we are continually
beset with financial worries.

Our University became state-related to supposedly relieve this insti-
tution of the financial uncertainty that befell us two years ago when it
was revealed that the University was $19.5 million in debt. Yet ever since
we contemplated becoming state-related, we have had another type of
financial problem: wondering whether we’ll receive our state appropria-
tion. '

When this ,year’s senior class entered the University, we entered an
institution that was becoming known nation-wide as a rapidly improving
University. Our school had made amazing strides in a ten-year period,
moving from a largely commuter institution to a school comprised of two-
thirds resident students, over thirty per cent of whom were out of state.
Only eight per cent of this ye-ar’s freshman class are out-of-state students.

We continually hear promises of what this University is on the way
to beorning, but we also remember what this University was. We only hope
that we can recapture that lost spirit that this University once had: the
spirit of a University on the road to greatness.

to day, this would not have bothered me-, but

on Saturday it is a catastrophe. The week-

 end is the time in which college students are
supposed to make up for all the sleep they

miss on class days.

But, this was only part of my loss. The
other loss was to be held a captive audi-
ence by my TV set. Saturday morning is
cartoon day. These cartoons get to you like
a George Hamilton movie. They’re so bad
that you can’t turn them off.

But, aside from the unbelievable story
lines, there was something else about the
offerings that interested me. It is now ob-
vious that cartoons have caught up with
the rest of TV, with all of the horrifying
implications that statement implies.

WE HAVE GONE from the good old
Saturday morning shows like Howdy, Doody
and Fury (the fabled black stallion) to the
era of super-heroes such as Birdman and
Space Ghost. With the simple aim of a su-
per ﬁnger they turn ruthless enemies into
blobs of lifeless jelly.

This trend is similar to the way in
which prime time shows have gone. I re-
member with some fondness The Life of
Riley, The Honeymooners, Molly Goldberg,
I Remember Mama, and the others. These
programs bear no resemblance, either living
or dead, to the “entertainment” on the tube
today.

But, are the differences simply those of
quality writing and performing? I doubt it.
They seem to go much deeper than that.
What we ‘have witnessed in the transfor-
mation of William Bendix into Fred Mc-
Murray is a change in the entire American
outlook. This change is merely reﬂected by
what Newton Minnow called “a vast waste-
land.”

' THE ERA OF RILEY, Kramden, Mama
and Bilko was one with three characteris-
tics that ran through most shows! 1) a
certain ethnic identity, 2) blue collar, he-

by Michael Brourman

roes, and 3) happily married families.

The names breathed with life. The fam-
ilies had accents — Yiddish, Norwegian,
Brooklynese, or working class. The wives
were devoted homemakers. The children
were normal. They weren't all straight A
students, All-Americans, perfectly behaved,
etc. The families scraped along, barely mak-
ing a living.

Today’s heroes are antiseptically pure
members of the middle class establishment.
Their names are chosen so as not to offend
anyone. All are WASP’s, college-educated.
Professional men have replaced blue—collar
workers. Widowed heroes make for ro-
mance, romance makes for interest, inter-
est makes for high ratings. The children

. star in everything they do. Patty Duke

was president and leader of every activity
went on in Brooklyn Heights High.

THE SUPER HERO has emerged. Su-
per-spies, super-detectives, super—cowboys
and the like have replaced bus drivers and
aircraft assembly workers. Gadgetry is re-
garded highly. We have genies, witches, se-
cret weapons, and rocket ships.

It makes for bad TV. But, it was in-
evitable. The beginnings of large-scale TV
came during the end of an era in American
history. We were moving into the computer
age. It has been natural for TV to reﬂect
this change.

The old shows, the good shows were the
culmination of that particular era of Amer-
ican development. The new shows, the bad
ones merely point out the changes we have
undergone.

THEY SHOW THE beginning of a new
cycle. Hopefully, they will improve.

But, for the present, we have to put up
with them. Who can we blame? No one
really. It's progress, and progress is inevit-
able. But, after sitting through a half hour
of Birdman, it’s not hard to imagine why
many have said that progress is often pain-
ful.

THE PITT NEWS

lIIIlII||}||,

Reader Knocks
ROTC Critics

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing, ﬁrst with re-
gard to the ‘statements by Dr.
James Holland in the Nov. 15
issue of The Pitt News (which
issue could be retitled “Dr. Hol-
land Speaks”), and secondly, re-
garding the letter written by Mr.
Frank in the Nov. 13 issue of
The Pitt News .

Br. Holland-’s major premise
is that ROTC “tries to take on
the trimmings of an academic

course.” He cited: numerous dif-“

ferences between ROTC and
other courses. One of these dif-
ferences is the requirement that
one had to sign an oath saying
he was not a member of cer-
tain organizations, thus, accord-
ing to Dr. Holland, “placing a
requirement of political ortho-
doxy.” Another difference is
that Advanced ROTC gives some
inducements, such as $40 a
m-onth pay. Dr. Holland further
bemoaned the fact that a per-
son‘ who -accepted an ROTC
scholarship had to serve an ex-
tra two years on active duty.
This brings back memories of
indentured servitude to him.

Dr. Holland further complain-
ed that ROTC professors were
“appointed by the military to
the faculty of the University,
and with this appointment went
the title of Professor of Military
Science, with full faculty priv-
iliges." Perhaps Dr. Holland is
worried that -the faculty will be
contaminated by a “militarist”
in their midst, or perhaps he
resents a member of the armed
services having the same full
faculty priviliges that he enjoys.
Would he be satisﬁed if the
Army gave him and the rest of
the faculty a pass to the Offi-
cers’ Club?

Concerning the rest of Dr.
Holland's points, they all boil
down to this: Is a college stu-

dent worthy of making an inde-
pendent decision to join the
ROTC program? Dr. Holland re-
fers 'to the presence of ROTC on
-camspus as a rape and subersion
of the University. If there were
no demand for ROTC, it would
not -continue on campus. All
oaths taken are done so with
the full knowledge and consent
of the student. If a student is
under-age, he must have paren-
tal permission to take advanced
ROTC, and hence sign the con-
tract  the Army 91" Air
Force. I feel all University stu-
dents are capable -of making the
choice whether or not to take
ROTC. 'I‘.hi-s, Dr. Holland, is aca-

demic freedom, not the irnposi- ‘

tion of your Views on everyone
in the University community.
In Mr. Fra.mk’s letter of Nov.
13, he questioned the legitimacy
of the military in this country.
He seems to blame the military
for all the evils in the world to-
day. For all his criticisms and
innuendos, exactly What «type (if
any) of military establishment
does Mr. Frank wish the United
States to adopt. One of the
terms he frequently uses and
criticizes is “blind obedience.”
Does Mr. Frank desire a mili-
tary in which soldiers are free

to obey or disobey their super-

ions at will? With a military es-
tablishment of this nature, We'd
still be singing “God Save the
Queen.”

I would like to conclude by
stating that I am not in ROTC.
I am just a student who is sick
and ‘tired of some faculty mem-
bers and the Students for Peace
and similar groups trying to
d-omina-te and legislate Universi-
ty. ‘Policy and the personal mor-
ahty of everyone on campus. I
respect anyoneﬁs right to peace-
fully dissent, but not to force
their small minority opinions on
everybody else, under the guise
of academic freedom.

Cagers Open Tonight At Rutgers;
Timmons Expects Improved Team

_ Basketball coach Bob Tim-
mons says this year’s team
is much improved over the

squlads of the past few seasons,
and it has more depth. Others

6‘ say that there is little improve-

ment; that 'I‘.im-mons makes the
same sta.tement yea-r after year.

A clue to who is night should
be provided tonight when the
Panthe-rs travel to Rutgers for
their season opener.

Last year, operating behind a
fine pair of guards in All-Amer-
ican Bob~by.Lloyd and Jim Val-
vano, the Scarlet Knights trounc-
ed the cagers 87-68. It was one
of 22 victories Rutgers compiled
on their way to a third place
ﬁnish in the NIT.

Bob Valvano and Lloyd have
graduated. In fact, only two
starters remain from the NIT
squad.

Bu-t Rutgers has some good
players returning, and they will
also have the home court ad-
vantage which, in basketball, is

generally cons-idered to beworth
about ten points.

All things considered then,
this should provide a stiff test
for the Panthers, and also serve
as an indicator of how the sea-
son will go.

Timmons says that he will go
against Rutgers. This means
with his “best ﬁve ballplayers”
that the Panthers will open
without a center. Mike Patcher,
who has been playing forward
in practice, will be the nominal
center.

This year’s Steel Bowl Bas-
ketball Tournament will be
held at the Civic Arena Dec’.
8 and 9. In addition to. the
Panthers, the teams will in-
clude Duquesne, Massachusetts
and Air Force. Student tickets
are available for $1.50 at the
Field House or the Student
Union desk.

Pa-tcher, a 6-4 sophomore from
J ohnstown, is also one of three
sophs in the starting lineup. Rob
McFarland, 6-5, from Michigan
City, In-d., and Bob Petrini, 6-3,
from Washington, D. C., are the
others.

The -sorphs will be joined by a
pair of senior veterans in 6-4
Ken Bollens and 6-2 guard Pete
Smith. Backing them, says Tim-
mons, is a good bench. “I don’t
think that Len (Kalata), Steve
(Stevenson), Tony (De Lisio),
or Charlie (Hunt) hurt us too
much when they’re in there,”
he commented.

Timmons has been studying
the ﬁlms of last year’s game in
order to get a line on Rutgers,
but he has found them of little
help. “Last year with those two
great guards they were an out-
side shooting team and had an
outside attack,” he noted. “This
year I expect them to have an
inside attack.”

Timmons’ ideas are borne out
by Rutgers coach Billy Foster,
who has toyed with the idea of
using only one guard and four
inside men. “If I can get the
right guard,” says Foster.

Right now, Eoster’~s starting
lineup is headed by 6-6 forward
Bob Graecen, who is the leading
returning score-r. The other start-
ers are Doug Britelle and Rich
Harley, both 6-6; Barry Milan-
kow, 6-4; and Jack Penhall, 6-3.

All are returners from last
year’s ﬁne team, but aside from
Graecen, who averaged 10 points,
they provided little scoring
punch.

However, Foster says they
are much improved and consi-
ders his team a tournament con-
tender. In any event, the Scar-
let Knights should provide the
Panthers with an acid test.

Gymnasts Oppose Cornell;

Coach Neiger Uses Frosh

Coach Warren Neiger is
hoping that freshman re-
cruits will bolster the gymnas-
tic team in their first meet of
the season, tomorrow at Cornell.

“We don’t have enough up-
perelassmen to make a full
team,” noted Neiger. “Teams in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Gym-
nastics League must ca.rry only
upperclassmen. But becaue of our
manpower shortage we will use
freshmen and operate as a club.

Neiger has shown some op-
timism about his team. “I am
going to use freshmen Phil Lil-
Iy and Mike Beatty with Dave
Shidemantle on the sidehorse,”
he said.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents Peter GI

Richard Burton-

“On the longhorsc I am work-
ing Shidemantle with Dave An-
drew, another freshman.

Shidemantle and Bill Dodson
head the list. of returnees. “Shide-
mantle will be our «all-around
man against Cornell," Neiger
said. “I intend to use him and
Dodson in the all-around event
this season.”

Shidemantle, injured much of
last season, was the Eastern
champion on the longhorse in
1965.

The coach has no strategy for
tomorrow’s meet.
had a chance to ﬁnd out any-
thing about Cornell,” he said.
“I will just play my best men.”

Quadrangular Meet

Matmen Test Strength at Ohio St.

By Saturday night coach
Dave Adams should have a
good indication of the rela-
tive strength of his first varsity
wrestling team. The grapplers
open their season tomorrow af-
ternoon with a quadrangular
meet against Ohio Sta-te, Hiram,
«and Eastern Michigan at Col-
umbus.

“We’re pretty much
dark,”

in the
analyzed Adams, “not

__ knowing the other teams. Rough-

ly, I would guess that Eastern
Mich.-igian is the t-oughest. I im-
agine that Ohio State and Hiram
are about the same strength.”

coach is Bobby Fehrs, a former
Big Ten wrestling champion,
and he was able to shed a lit-
tle more light onto the opposi-
tion.

“Ohio State usually ﬁnishes
about ﬁfth or sixth in the Big
Ten somewhere around the mid-
dle,” reported Fehrs. “They’ve
got a fair 130 pounder and a
fair heavyweight.

“Eastern Michigan has three
boys that -are pretty tough,” he
continued. “Kesse1l at 123 and
Kohler at heavyweight both
wrestled for Michigan a couple
years ago. Their 137 pounder’s
also tough.”

Hiram was the -clra.-mplion of
‘ .

the Ohic Conference last year.
Their top wrestler is also a 123
pcunder. With the va-rsity's top
sophomore Bruce Unangst wrest-
ling at 123, it shapes up as one
of the better battles of ‘the meet.

The varsity is not without its
problems, however. Earlier this
week Ron Schuchert injured his
leg in practice. He will deﬁnite-
ly miss tomorrow’s match and
may be out until after Christ-
mas, leaving a gap at 137.

For the most part, things are
looking up for the varsity. Tim
Trax, Jim Rhone, and Paul Al-
len have looked good. Tomorr-
row is, however, their ﬁrst real
chance.

‘Beulah’ Clinches Yogi Title;

In the biggest upset since the
Demlocnatic machine was turn-

“Beulah” Goldstein won the
Yogi contest, edging out Mike
“Hawk” Brourman, .667 to .660.

“It just goes to show how
worthless this is,” screamed the
“Hawk,” while George “Mous-

should go to Nick the Greek
instead of the Big Wind.”

JOHN LANE
Senior Freestyler

explained Grant. “But I am con-
ﬁdent that they’ll be able to do
it. They are in ﬁne physical con-
dition.” E

Saturday night’s opponent is
the first swimming team in In-

   

diana Starte’s history. “Because
they are a brand new teaxn, I
know practically nothing about
them,” Grant said. “I have no
idea what is going to happen in
the meet, but I do know our
boys are ready.”

Leading the team again this
year is John Lane. Grant des-
cribes Lane as “our best free-
style swimmer and probably the
best swimmer on the team.”
Lane swims «anything from the
50-yard freestyle to the 1,000-
yard freesltyle. Saturday night,
he’ll probably swim in the 200,
500, and 1,000 ytard freestyle
events. If Granlt needs him, Lane
may also ‘swim a leg of the med-
ley and freestyle rrelays.

Behind Lane are the Norris
twins, Howard and Richard.
Both are juniors and both gain-
ed experienced on the team last
year. Rich swims the individual
