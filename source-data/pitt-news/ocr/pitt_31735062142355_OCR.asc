SFA Equal Representation p

Highlights First Assembly

Equal representation of fraternity and non-fraternity

students in the student govern
. issue of University political life, as Aldo Icardi, C43, Inde-

pendent vice-president of the Stu-
‘dent-Faculty association, demand-
ed before the opening meeting of
SFA that Al Minno, C44, be dis-
missed from the assembly.

Icardi charged that Minno was
ineligible for membership because
he had been elected to SFA as an
Independent and had since joined
a fraternity. (Because of the
amendment written into the SFA
constitution last Spring, the body
must be composed of 32 student
members selected from represen-
tative groups-—i.e., 16 from fra-

' ' ternity and 16 from non-fraternity.

SFA president Gus Wilde, C43,
who is also president of Pi Kap-
pa Alpha fraternity, immediate-
ly ruled Icardi out of order.
Icardi then appealed Wilde’s de-
cision to the assembly. A vote
was taken, and Wilde’s decision

PTM Presents

First Luncheon
Meeting Today

Pitt town meeting will present
for the ﬁrst time a luncheon meet-
ing today at 12:30 o’clock in 24
Cathedral. announced Victor Carl-
son, C43, chairman.

According to Carlson, the change
in time will comply with the re-
quest of many students and will
facilitate attendance. Pitt town
meeting will be conducted on the
same basis that it has been in the
past, with the additional advantage
of enabling students to eat their
lunch and attend the programs at
the same time.

First speaker under the new ar-
rangements will be Jacob J. Blair,

assistant professor of economics.-

Mr. Blair has been active on the
National Labor Relations board,
andwill speak on the labor situa-
tion in the Uniter States today
and its relation to the war effort.
Commenting on the change in
policy, Carlson said that the
town metting committee was
prompted by numerous requests
of students, especially engineers,
to have the meeting presented at
a different time. If the turnout
of students warrants it, the
luncheon meeting will be con-
tinued regularly. -
Despite its change of time, Pitt
town meeting will ‘continue along
the same lines as those formerly
presented. Time will be allowed at
the end of each meeting for a ques-
tion period during which the audi-
ence may direct questions at the
speakers.

Calibre of the programs will not
in the le.ast be affected by the
change and it will attempt to pre-
sent speakers that are of interest
and signiﬁcance to the student
body, according to Carl-son.

'Lincoln' Cast

Aids ln Drive

Members of the cast of “Abe
Lincoln in Illinois” have volunteer-
er to aid the stamp drive commit-
tee in selling stamps and bonds to-
morrow. ‘

The sales booth will be moved
from its regular position in the
ground floor elevator lobby to the
entrance of Stephen Foster me-
morial at 3 o’clock. Cast members
will wear costumes and will be aid-
ed by the rest of the Pitt Players.

Committee co-chairman Dick
Hartz, BA43, and_ Pitt Player Har-
old Gondelman, C43, urge students
who attend the performance at
3:30 o’clock to buy at least one
stamp.

Hartz predicts that this week’s
totals will double last week’s ef-
forts, which were not too en-
couraging, since only $593.75

- was taken in.’ Of this amount,

$424.75 was in bonds, and $169

with the University War In-
formation center, present
“Abe Lincoln in Illinois” to-
morrow in Foster Memorial
at 3:30 o’clock. Admission is
by ticket number 20 in the
student activities book and
four people will be admitted
with each ticket. Friends and
relatives may come with the
students.

Buell Whitehill, Jr., director
of players and assistant profes-
sor of English, has streamlined
the play so that performance
time is now one and a half hours
instead of the original two and
a half hours.

“Abe Lincoln In Illinois” writ-
ten by Robert E. Sherwood, de-
picts the rise of Abe Lincoln from
a debt ridden postmaster in New
Salem, Illinois, to the highest of-
fice in the nation. Romantic in-
terest is furnished in his interlude
with Mary Todd and Ann Rutledge.

The role of Abe Lincoln is taken
by Harold Gondelman. Margaret
Holland has the part of Mary Todd,
Lincoln’s wife. Lincoln’s ﬁrst love,
Ann Rutledge is played by Alice
Conick.

ﬁrst opportunity to formally meet
the representatives of women's
fraternities on campus tomorrow
evening, when they attend the Pan-
Hellenic reception in the social

Fraternities 19; Independents 13

What happened at the last meeting of
SFAi——-the refusal to replace newly pledged
if1'a.ternity men, who had been elected by the
Independents, with bona ﬁde non-fraternity
men——seems‘to us to be_a clear-cut betrayal .
of the trust of the majority of University
students. _ ‘ _

. Brieﬂy, here’s what happened. Last spring
Peter Shanta, Robert Burford, and Al Minno .
were-independents. They were put up by the
Independent partyto represent non-frater-

‘ nity students in the student government or-
ganization. . .

- All three were elected as INDEPEND-

ENT representatives to SFA. —

, And at the same time more students than
had ever before participated in an election
demanded once and for all that fraternity
domination of student government must
stop. .

Eleven hundred students wanted equal
representation for both fraternity and non-
fraternity groups. Sixteen fraternity men
and sixteen independents.

Since their election on the Independent
ticket, however, SFA me_m_bers Minna,
Shanta, and Burford have Joined, 01‘ S00“
will join, fraternities. This means that now
there will be 19 fraternity men and 13 Inde-
pendents in SFA. _ _ . .

The students, of this University gave their
overwhelming support to equal representa-

19 fraternity men and 13 Independents. ‘

The Pitt News has no grievance against
the three men who ‘went fraternity. But,
as the "voice of the student body here, we
feel that we must protest against a system
which would have fraternity men repre-
senting Independents.

And SFA’s refusal to ask the resignation
of these men reminds us of the old days .
last spring when the fraternity packed ex-
ecutive committee of SFA rode roughshod
over the wishes of the student body, and as
a result they and theinterests for which
they were work-ing were voted down_in the
biggest protest vote ever rung up in Pitt

Now again SFA is standing in the way of
expressed student opinion. And again SFA
stands_in danger of dying from ‘a loss of
student respect and student interest. Be-
cause student government can function only
so long as it expresses the wishes of the ma-
jority of the students.

When student government becomes a
machine by which the demands of most of
the students can be thwarted by an organ-
ized and willful minority, that student gov-

Letters to the Editor . . -

We Were Glad To . . .
Editor, The Pitt News:

On behalf of the Pittsburgh
Chapter and the National Chapter
of the American Red Cross, I wish
to extend the thanks of those or-
ganizations to the administration,
Faculty, and students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, for their
marvelous cooperation in the Vol-
unteer Blood Donor Service, which
is being carried on for the United
States Army and Navy. Now, for
the second time, the.st"udents of
the University of Pittsburgh have
demonstrated their patriotism and
given generously of themselves to
the men in the Service.

I cannot overstate the gratitude
of the Red Cross officials and of
the officials of the National Re-
‘search Council (Medical Division)
for the generosity, ﬁne spirit and
complete cooperation of the stu-
dents at Pitt. They are a splendid
crowd of young men and women.

We wish also to extend our
thanks to the Pitt News, and to
express our admiration for its sup-
port of the project, both on the
occasion of this visit to the Uni-
versity and on the prior occasion,
when the Mobile Unit visited the
Pitt Campus. Your work has been
eﬁicient, intelligent and challeng-
ing. Thanks very much. '

Nebulous ‘Freedoms’ . . .
Editor,iThe Pitt News: '

We applaud your though-provok-
ing editorials. Yoursuggestion in
the editorial “The Home Front”
(Oct. 20), that we should be think-
ing and acting on the things for
which we say we are ﬁghting, is
well taken.

Are we clear about the things
for which we are ﬁghting? Or
are the Four Freedoms such
nebulous and intangible things
that it is hard to visualize ex-
actly what they mean?

How will we bring about “free-
dom from want”. . . ? How can

we implement “freedom of expres-
sion"’ in the entire world . . .?
Have we reached a solution for
this problem when southern Ne-
groes and “poor” whites cannot

vote and when political minorities,

are denied a place on the ballot,
and critics of the war effort are
shouted down with the cry “na-
tional unity”?

gridde1‘s last Saturday afternoon, did happen, and the Blue and
Gold showed what real southern hospitality meant as they

  

‘ing the Duke Blue Devils their third victory of the season.

  . Whether the locals thought that the law of averages
 , Ywould win this game for them, or whether they thought that
 l i the Duke eleven would not offer much resistance, no one will
never know. But regardless of what it was, the Pitt team
T showed one of their most pathetic performances. Slip-shod
 tackling, shoddy blocking, inaccurate forward passing, num-
§_; erous fumbles, poor center passing, and a lack of spirit on
;r.gtV_l1ie part_of a squad combined to give the clever band of
 opportunlsts from Durham, North Carolina, an easy 28-0 win.

It is true Pitt was not expected to win this game. They

[the ﬁght and determination that they showed in their previous
3 tilts were enough to merit them a close game. Last Saturday
A 2 afternoon, the ﬁght and determination wasn’t there, the team
was battered and injured, and the fans watched a team that
looked completely lost on the gridiron. They simply didn’t

» , Probably the only ray of light on the Stadium ﬁeld was
the brilliant play of “Weston Willie” Dutton. Although his
passing was not up to par, .Dutton’s running and defensive
play was only a mite short of miraculous. Besides Dutton,
Sotack, Kyle, and Durishan played commendable games, but

 With only a few remnants left of the strong physical

 team that started the season against Minnesota, Coach
., ~ Charley Bowser will have his hands full this week. getting
  his patched-up lineup in trim for Saturday’s contest with the
I  ; surprising Tech Tartans.
'1 _ Tech will be waiting for this game. They have been look-
‘a g ahead all season for their traditional fray with the Oak-
land lads, and there is no doubt that they will be playing over
their heads in the Pitt game.

 T In addition to the injuries, Bowser’s problem will consist
pf. getting the Jungle Cats up for the game. Certainly, the
squad will look at this game as a breather, but little Joe Pash
of Tech will quickly make them forget it. If the Pitts walk
into the game with over-confidence, the record book will show
defeat number ﬁve. .

. _ I-t will be the first time this season that Pitt will be
favorites, and deservingly so. Pitt, although weak in re-
serves, is still a fine ball club. Tech, likewise weak in reserves,
 at best, mediocre.

‘ ‘ Freshmen will be'used next Saturday afternoon against
"fa Tartans for the ﬁrst time in the modern history of the
niversity. The Faculty Athletic Committee early last week
‘ade the revisions _of their previous ruling, and the handful
ofcapable freshmen that Bowser has may make a difference.
. They will be used sparingly this Saturday, only to get
me valuable experience, but against the Nittany Lions from
enn State, these boys may play a lot of ball.

By ELAINE KAHN

Every cloud has its silver lining,
even, apparently, one as dark and
menacing as the Pitt schedule, for
the Panthers will be given a slight
breather from the likes of Minne-
sota and Duke this Saturday when
Carnegie Tech makes its 27th an-
nual pilgrimage to the Stadium.

Once the big event of the local
gridiron season, the series has .in
recent years sulfered from mutual
cases of deemphasis. But, although
the series records shows Pitt
holding a lopsided margin of 21
wins against only 5 losses andone
tie, the games have always been
good ones with the emphasis on the
thrilling and unexpected.

Pitt, for the ﬁrst time this season,
and, indeed, the ﬁrst time since the
Carnegie Tech game last year, will
be favored to win, although,
strangely enough; it is the Tartans
that have the best rec_ord to date.
The Skibos can boast of three wins
and three defeats, while Pitt can
only console itself with thoughts of
the thorough lashing they handed
SMU and the excellent showing
they . made against Great Lakes
even in defeat.

However it should be noted that
Westminster, Grove City, and Buf-
falo are mere minor league second
cousins ‘of such football greats as
Minnesota, Indiana, and Duke.

The Pitt-Tech Series started
away back in 1906" before either
school had become a football
power. The Panthers began acting

in a rather unneighborly manner
right from the start, for they took

 

the ﬁrst three games from. Tech.‘

There was no game in 1909, but
the Panthers made up for this
lapse in 1910 when they handed
the Techites a 35-0 setback.

It was in 1919 that rivalry
reached such apeak that the clashes
olf the gridiron became very much
rougher than the clashes on the
gridiron and it was felt best for all
concerned to suspend relations be-
tween the two schools.

Four years later the schobls were
once again on football speaking
terms and the Skibos racked up
their ﬁrst victory, 7-2. Greatest up-
set of the series was in 1938 when
Curly Stebbens started out by dash-
ing 97 yards to score on the open-
ing kickoff. But Tech led by Merlyn
Condit came right back to win the
game, 20-10. , -

There is quite a story to that
defeat, for late the following
night the delirious Tech students

Id.   Tec

returned to the Stadium, and pH. 

fered the goal posts. A Pitt raid-
ing party attempted to get them
back but fared almost as badly as
their football team had.

Then, a few weeks before the vi
1939 game, a few loyal Pittites, ,-

sawed the same goalposts from
their base in front of Scobell Hall
and dragged them to the other side
of Forbes Street. It was then that
the respective student councils de-
cided that henceforth the goal posts

would go to the winner of the an-.

nual game, to be kept until the next
game as a trophy. . .
Since 1939 the goal posts and the
games have gone pretty much as
Pitt wanted them to and it does not

appear that things will be muchl a
different this year. The Panthers 1

are smarting from their ignomin-
ious defeats at the hands of Duke
and Indiana. They might just be
planning to take a little revenge
by pouncing on poor, hapless Cal'-
negie Tech.

Carlson Teaches Cagers
NewlOiiensive System

From all indications it looks as
though scorers for all future Pitt
basketball games will have to pro-
vide themselves with Burroughs
adding machines, for the Pitt’s are
concentrating strictly on offense
this year. . ‘ "

The emphasis will be -on the
slam bang, volunteer ﬁre depart-
ment brand of play instead of the
slow, cautious variety, and the
Panthers will be using an over.
and around offense instead of the
man ahead of the ball type for-
merly in use.

Basketball mentor Carlson ex-
plains the change with, “When you
are loaded with reserves and tal.
ent you can try for polished per-
fection and wait for the breaks to
come to you, but when both re-
serves and talent are limited you
have to go out and make your own
breaks which is what we aim" to do.

“We are going to give them a

wide open, free scoring game
this year. We may give the other
team a few extras, but we’ll also
be in there getting a few extras
ourselves.”

Only twelve men in all have I

come out for the practice sessions

iwhich began last week. Steve Shu-
ber, Tay Malarkey, Paul Lohmey-.

er, Bob Artman, John Swacus, and

Whitey Carlson are the only 30-" it

turning members who saw action
in games last year.

’ Very, very conspicuous by t-‘heir
absence will be high scorer Lav-

ry Patfrath, and Lefty Ziolkowski V

who were lost through gradua-
tion.

What the team will do this year
rests squarely on thesboys, accdrdo
ing to Dr. Carlson. “If they want
to win and ﬁght hard we’ll win
them all,” he announced. “If they

don’t care, we’ll be even worieii

than last year——if possible.”

tion and the Young Women’s He-
brew Association, Thursday at
3:45 p. m. in Heinz Memorial Chap-
d, announces ‘Mary Louise Con-
over, Ed43, president.

To these young women of the
University, the YWCA endeavors
to emulate noble women who have
achieved immortality by the cari-
tas they have given the world.
Caritas means loving kindness with
the acts, deeds, and work that
make it eﬁelctive in the lives of
men.

The ceremony is both religious
and secular, and is in three parts:
(ta) Reverentia or Worship, (b)
Earitas, or Love to God and Man,
and (c) Benediction, or Blessing.

Jean Kimpel, C45, is chairman
of the ceremony, and Janet Lin-
coln, C43, is the student leader.
The verse speaking group is un-
der the direction of Miss Ruth
I-Iaun of the speech department.

Rev. Raymond Brittain will give
the invocation and Dr. William‘
Farmer, D.D., will offer an eve-
ning prayer and the benediction.

The newest feature of the Cari-
tas program is the formation of
the V for Victory toward preserv-
ing highest values of our culture.

All women of the faculty, mem-
bers of the YWCA and any other
guests are invited.

WAA Entertains
Freshman Girls

Rain or shine, WAA had their
Freshman outing. Although it had
to be in the gym, everyone partici-
pated with fullest enthusiasm.
Freshman, mentors,
teachers and WAA girls all took
part in the festivities.

As each Freshman entered the
gym they. were handed tags of
one color; this was to divide the
girls into separate groups. After
this was done, they were introduc-
od to'their group leaders who help-
ed them prepare a square dance
or a harmony skit as their color
tag indicated.

The lunch boxes were packed by
the wives of the Pitt Faculty and
Marge Linn and her social com-
mittee.

In ESM WT Defense Course

The sixth Engineering Science
Management and War Training
Program started at the University
this week. Out o‘f a total enroll-
ment of 3,350 students, 1,000 are
women.

Last January the ﬁrst ESMWT
program was introduced here to
insure a steady ﬂow of skilled
worker into the shops of indus-
try. Now that the number of
eligible and available men is de-
clining, women workers are des-
tined to account for over ﬁfty
per cent of future enrollments.

Primary experiments in indus-
try courses dealt largely with fun-
damentals of engineering for high
school graduates. Mathematics,
chemistry, and physics were super-

’ ﬁcially touched upon, but did not

prepare the student for any one
particular job. The addition of ele-
mentary chemistry and engineering
drawing along diffused lines also
failed to attain the required result.

Recently, the course was radi-
cally changed. Fundamentals of
Engineering have been dropped
and replaced by subjects involv-
ing mathematics and particular
phases of science with speciﬁc
job application. Courses are now
being offered on the campus as
well as at Erie and Johnstown
Centers. The facilities of the
Westinghouse Technical Night
School round out the largest con-
centration. of training elfort to
be found anywhere in the Unit-
ed States.

was over-ruled.

The issue, following discussion
by the assembly, was defeated by
one vote. Among those voting
against dismissal were Bob Bur-
ford, E43; Pete Shanta, E43, and
Al Minno, ‘C43, all of whom, Icardi
charged, would pledge fraternity
by this week. All three were elect-
ed to SFA as Independents last
spring. .

Icardi said that nothing could be
done until the next meeting of
SFA, when he promises to again
bring the issue before the assem-
bly, which by then will include the
faculty members of SFA. The only
faculty members who voted in last
week’s meeting were Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men, and Robert L.
Arthur, assistant dean of men, both
of whom voted that Minna should
not be dismissed from SFA.

After the issue of dismissal had
been closed Icardi moved that the
following amendment be added to
the constitution of SFA:

A. There shall be on Judicial Court
of SFA.

B.. Composition: It shall be com-
posed of nine members, six seni-
or men and three senior women,
all appointed by the executive
committee.

C. Powers: (a) It shall receive
complaints from the faculty,
SFA committees, and students
regarding any infractions of
SFA rules.

(b) It shall hear and judge on

evidence presented to it regard-

ing such infractions.

(c) It shall have the power to

punish any ojfcnder, whether

group or individual, by or fine

not to exceed $150; by recom-

mending to the administration

Contribute To  

The Penny Drive  

“Use Your Good Cents—'-It 
Doesn't Cost a Penny.” That’_s the. 
slogan of a new drive started here .
to aid the war effort. ‘* ‘

Purpose of the drive is to have
students and faculty members
“trade in for cash” 100 tons worth ,
of pennies that have been stored M
away in penny banks and coin col-/“
lections. Pennies are now needed ,
to ease the country’s penny short-
age. »

This is one way you can help
the war eﬁort without spending
a cent. For every 5 pennies you
will receive a nickel. So go home 
and find that penny bank you had 
when you were young, or get, ’
your younger brother’s or sis- '
ter's, or get the pennies from
your coin collection board.

     
   
  

Bring the pennies in tomorrow
morning to the coin collection booth I
which‘will be set up in the cams,
mons room. Collections will be
made at the‘ booth by freshman « 
BA students.

Dr. J. Ellwood Amos, assistant; . 
professor of ﬁnance, who organ-
ized the idea with the approval
of the mint in a preliminary col-
lection and exchange last Friday,
collected over 16,500 pennies in
his freshman ﬁnance classes.
