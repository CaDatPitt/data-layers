Parents Will Attend

Upperclass Aides Selected
For Chancellor’s Affair
At Memorial Hall

BEGINS AT 8 O’CLOCK

By Lester Herrup

Parents of the 1,000 freshmen
in the class of 1940 are attend-
ing Chancellor’s reception to-
night in Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial Hall for the purpose of
checking up on the work of their
respective sons and daughters. The
reception, which begins at 8 o’clock,
marks the 15th one of its kind held
annually by the chancellor.

The University orchestra, under the
direction of Lee M. Lockhart, will
open the program with a selection of
several numbers. Dr. John G. Bow-
man, chancellor of the University, the
featured speaker of the evening, will
address the audience immediately
after the last number by the orches-
tra. In his address Dr. Bowman will
greet the parents and explain to them
the purpose of the meeting.

Grades To Be Issued

The ﬁrst part of the program, which
is to be held in the auditorium of the
Memorial Hall, will be concluded with
selections by the Women’s Choral, led
by Mrs. Robert D. Ayars. Student
aides will then direct the parents to
the banquet hall, where grades for
the first six weeks period will be
issued.

After receiving their son’s
daughter’s grades, parents will have
an opportunity of meeting their pro-
fessors and advisers in conference. At
this time, they will learn the reasons
behind the marks on the cards.

Faculty members will be stationed
in booths along the balcony of the
banquet floor, and their positions _will
bedesignated in pamphlets to be ,dis_-_

" tributed to each parent. Members of

the administration, including E. A.
Holbrook, dean of the schools of
engineering and mines; Dr. Leonard
O’Connell, dean of the school of
pharmacy; Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the college; Dr. Charles S.
Tippetts, dean of the school of busi-
ness administration, will also be sta-
tioned in the banquet hall.

Amos, dean of women, and Dr. Vin-

Men’s Orientation
Classes T o T o u r

Cathedral Library

The intricacies of the University
Library will be explained to freshman
men during their orientation class on
Tuesday of next week and Thursday
of the following week when they will
be personally conducted through the
various rooms by the members of the
library staff of which J. Howard Dice
is the head.

According to Mr. Dice, each group
will be under the supervision of one
staff member who will explain to them
the methods for taking out books and
the use of each division of the library, _
including the periodical, reference and
reserve book rooms.

As yet no plans have been made
for acquainting the freshman women
with the library, but Mr. Dice will
confer with the executive committee
of WSGA on Wednesday afternoon,
at which time he will suggest a simi-
lar tour for the girls.

These visits should prove a valu-
able part of freshman orientation
since many of the freshmen have been
unable to make full use of the library
because of insufficient knowledge as to
its workings.

School Of Pharmacy

Invading the campus socially for
the first time, students in the School
of Pharmacy are sponsoring a dance

low’s Winter Haven.

lars may be purchased from the stu-
dent representatives, Sidney Gondel-
man, Ph39, and Daniel Mosenson,

Korean Spealee r
Tells YM-YWCA
Of Cooperatives

Development of a consumers’ co-
operative movement is progressing in
Korea, according to Mrs. Induk Pak,
Korean sociologist, in her address
Monday evening to the YM-YWCA
upperclass club.

Explaining living conditions in Ko-
rea, Mrs. Pak said, “Eighty-two out
of every 100 Koreans are farmers. but
75 out of these 82 are tenants. Be-
cause of the poverty of most of these
people, the cooperative movement
started and is now making headway.

“Out of the proﬁts of cooperative
buying and selling, Korean villages
set aside 10 per cent for maintaining
schools, and divide the rest among
the members on the share basis,”
Mrs. Pak stated.

721 Students Contribute
$694 Toward Goal

The University has made an un-
precedented start in the drive to col-
lect $11,000 as its share for the Com-
munity Fund campaign, according to
J . G. Quick, registrar a.nd general

With only part of the ﬁrst day
solicitation counted and checked at 4

o’clock Wednesd-ay, the report from
the treasurer was that $694.50 had
been received in contributions and
pledges from 721 students. This in-
cludes $230.25 received in cash.

This incomplete return shows that
so far the average individual contri-_
bution has been one dollar. The
$694.50, Mr. Quick emphasizes, rep-
presents only the envelopes as yet
counted which had been turned in
from the canvas made during the
second hour on Wednesday. It does
not include the engineering and
mines schools, the professional
schools, or the other undengraduate
classes canvassed yesterday during
the third hour.

“Flying Squads"

Of the 25 faculty workers in the
faculty campaign, reports from ﬁve
show that $1,258 had been contrib-
uted either in cash or pledged, by 4
o’clock Wednesday. The faculty cam-
paign to raise $7,500 began on Mon-
day and ends today.

The results thus far indicate that
the Student Chest campaign this year
will be more successful than it was
last year, Mr. Quick believes.

The campaign will continue today
as the “Flying Squads” of women ac-
tivity leaders solicit all those who do
not wear a red feather indicating that
they have been canvassed. The women
will be stationed at all entrances of
State and Alumni Halls, and the Ca-
thedral.

More complete returns will be an-
nounced in the Monday issue of The
News.

Holiday Recess

Thanksgiving r e c e s s, during
which time no University classes
will be held, will extend from 4:30
o’clock Wednesday, November 25,

sive. The offices will be closed
on Thanksgiving Day, but will open
as usual on Friday and Saturday,
November 27 and 28.

Merit As-sembly
To Recognize
Achievement

TO GET PINS

This afternoon at 1 o’clock, fresh-
man women will attend the annual
Merit Panther Assembly at Heinz
House, where those who have met the

requirements will receive a silver
Panther pin, the sign of their achieve-
ment.

The women must have complied
with all regulations of the Customs
Committee and mentors for the past
eight weeks, maintained a friendly
attitude toward other freshmen and
upperclass women, showed a true Pitt
spirit, attended regularly all mentor
meetings, and received a one quality
point average (C average) with no
failures or incomplete work.

Green armbands, a part of the tra-
ditional customs for women, were
given to the freshmen at the cere-
mony held at Heinz House on Septem-
ber 23.

No More Restrictions

In addition to wearing the arm-
bands, freshman women were re-
quired to enter the rear doors of all
buildings on campus, and carry the
identiﬁcation cards given to them by
the Customs Committee.

On October 1 and 2, Customs ex-
aminations were given to freshmen,
who were required to know the Uni-
versity songs, the names of the ad-
ministrative oﬂicers, the officers of
WSGA, and some of the important
facts about the Cathedral. Blue and
gold felt armbands were then given to’
those who successfully passed the test,
which were worn until the end of
Customs regulations, October 6.

To celebrate the removal of the
armbands and the end of Customs
supervision, freshmen and members of
the Customs Committee met at the
football brunch held November 7,
when Heinz House was decorated to
represent a football ﬁeld.

Assembly Climaxes Events

The assembly today is a climax to
these events and is the last official
ceremony for freshman women. The
members of Customs Committee, who

Ervine Drama

Will Be Given
Monday Night

Drawing Room Play Replete
With English Accents,
Scottish Brogues

5

On Monday evening the Pitt Play-
ers will again claim the campus spot-
light when they present St. John
Ervine’s famous play, “The First Mrs.
Fraser,” in the Frick Auditorium.

A three-act play, Mr. Ervine’s
drama is a mixture of Socrates,
George Bernard Shaw, and 0. Henry.
It is replete with Scottish brogue and
English accents and should give the
Players ample opportunity to fasci-
nate the audience with rolling “r’s,”
dropped “g’s,” and clipped phrases.

The characters are an interesting
lot; an Oxford student, a divorced
wife, an about to be divorced wife, a
stooge or two (what play would be
complete without a stooge?) a parcel
of hot-blooded highlanders, maids,
butlers, and the like.

Mr. Ervine in his stage directions
comments on his c-hara-cters. For in-

stance, he terms his heroine Mrs.
Janet Fraser “a thoroughly nice
woman.” All through the play Mr.

Ervine seems to smile blandly to him-
self in his stage directions. Actually,
they’re a masterpiece, although no
one but the actors get a chance to
see them.

The play opens in Janet’s home.
After this things begin to happen. In
the gradual evolving of the plot there
are many verbal battles and always
conversation. In the se-cond act the
action becomes really complicated.
Prodigious amounts of sarcasm are
ﬂung back and forth; and in spots
melodrama holds full sway. Under-
cover love affairs are d-iscovered, as
they are ultimately in plays, and an-
other divorce raises its ugly head to
disturb the audience, but indubitably
not the playwright.

Appearing in the cast will be Shir-
ley Rugh, C38, as Janet Fraser; Rex
Loder, C40, as James Fraser; Babette
Braude, C39; as Elsie Fraser; Mary
Annette Campbell, C39, as Alice
Fraser; Jean Delmore, C37, as Mabel,

Ninian Fraser; Robert Gump, C38, as

Plaques To 70
Freshman Men

LEADF.—R_S AID

By Robert Adams

While their mid-term cards
are being prepared in the Regis-
trar’s office for delivery to par-
ents at the Chancellor’s recep-
tion this evening, freshman men
will be judged today for their rec-
ords for the ﬁrst eight weeks by a
court of upperclass activities leaders.

At the meeting of the judicial tri-
bunal for freshmen, to be held in the
banquet room of Memorial Hall at 1
o’clock today, nearly 70 plaques Will
be awarded to men of the class of

1940 who have excelled in activities
and scholarship.

According to Colonel J. L. Hol-
combe, head of the military science
department, freshmen in the ROTC
will be excused from the ﬁrst part of
drill period. They are expected to
report to Ruskin ﬁeld immediately
after the assembly is dismissed.

poenaed, climax the eight weeks’ cus-
toms period sponsored by the Cus-
toms Committee of Men’s Council.

Factors which will determine the
awarding of the plaques include cus-
toms test grades, participation in ac-
tivities, recommendations from fac-
ulty members and upperclass advisers,

block, and a scholastic average of 1.0
with no F’s. No freshman absent
from the assembly is eligible for a
plaque.

Awards will be announced by the
Chief Justice of the Tribunal, Paul
Jennings, C37, and eight associate
justices. Three clerks of court will
pass out the plaques, and four bailiffs
and the sergeant-at-arms will aid in
maintaining order.

Plaques to be given to freshmen for
outstanding work bear a large metal
seal of the University on a mahogany
shield.

“The plaques to be awarded are
much larger and ﬁner than those
which were given last year,” says
Jennings, who is co-chairman of the
Customs committee, along with Louis
Bearer, ChE37.

Panther Promenades I

November Issue Features
Jascha Heifetz, Carlson

 

By Butch

“Who was dat lady I seen you
wit’ last night?”

“That was no lady. That was the
Pitt Panther.”

(But at least this is a new method

of telling the student body that-the
Panther roams again, coming out of
its den some time next gweek.)

Featured in November's Panther
will be an article by Jascha Heifetz,
noted concert violinist, discussing
current radio programs and the ap-
preciation of music.

“In fact,” added Miss Irene Mat-
veak, editor of the magazine, “he
has an epitaph he Wrote for the
punch line. You oughta see it.”

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head bas-
ketball coach, expounds on the bas-
ket shooting of his ice cream sip-
pers. Nick Spanos writes an orgy
called “Boy Meets Girl,” an inter-
pretation of love by the masters.

In line with the recent News polls
on the men’s sentiments toward the
women and the Women’s toward the
men, the Panther prints two articles.
The ﬁrst is “What the Men Claim
the Women’s Criticisms of the Men
Claim, and Why Not.” The second,
“Why the Women Claim What They
Do, Claiming What the Men Claim
Is Open to Criticism.” Or sumthin’.

Short features, poetry, and the
usual departments will be included,
with a slight lunge toward the sophis-
ticated.

Charge In

Law School Students Hold
Political ‘Privilege’ Suit
In Downtown Court

?:__.....

Frank Reich, L39, will face Russell
Connolly, L38, this evening in Com-
mon Pleas Court, defending himself
of the charge that he called Con-
nolly, an “embezzler, a grafter, a
thief and a dirty crook.”

The slander charge is the crux of

the second mock trial, Connolly vs.
Reich, which will be held by two law
school fraternities, Phi Alpha Delta
and Tau Epsilon Rho. The case will
be tried in Judge Thomas Marshall’s
court on the seventh ﬂoor of the
City-County Building.

In the brief ﬁled by attorneys for
the plaintiif, Alexander Lindsay, Jr.,
and Bryson Schreiner, L38, Reich is
accused of having “falsely, malicious-
ly, wickedly and illegally, made and
published” the slander charge.

The case in the mock trial has been
built around a statement made dur-
ing a political campaign in which
Reich and Connolly were rivals for
state treasurer. Reich portrays a
wealthy country banker.

Defendant Reich’s attorneys, Leon-
ard Marks, L38, and Aaron Lincoff,
L38, are claiming the “privilege” of
political candidates. This defense is
built upon the unwritten law that
political rivals cannot be held liable
for statements made in the heat of a
campaign.

Attorneys for the defense will have
four witnesses in their battle to prove
Reich innocent. The four are Robert
Engle, L39; Gilbert Levine, L39; Sol
Abrams, L39, and Reichhimself.

Plaintiff’s witnesses are Connolly

ﬁve sections of the cheering block and James B. Moore, L38; Leroy
the key sections in forming the prowl- Lewis, L38, and Harry Robinson.
ing panther, according to Louis L39.

Bearer, E37, SFA chairman of the
block.

Students in Sections U, under
Ruth Rosenthal, C38; Z, under Jack

I Withum, E38; V, under Edwin Ellis,

BA39; AA, under Bernard McKen-
na, C39, and BB, under Richard
Frankel, C39, must be present at this
rehearsal. No other section members
need attend.

All members of the entire block are
expected to be in their sections by
1:30 o’clock on Thanksgiving Day,
Bearer said.

“Since we have performed credit-
able maneuvers so far,” he contin-
ued, “and since this will be our last
chance this season, we are prepared
to shoot the works, and put on our
best show of the year. Naturally we
must continue to have the support
of the members of the block.”

Stunts to be performed include the
prowling panther, the divided yell
formation, a flashing “C”, a turkey, a
Scotchman or Scotch terrier, and the
standard “P.”

DeVitis To Speak

Dr. M. A. DeVitis, associate pro-
fessor of modern languages, will ad-
dress the College Club of Italian
Women, tomorrow at 3 o’clock.

Meeting in the Downtown YWCA
building on Chatham Street, the Ital-
ian Club will hear Dr. DeVitis speak
on “Modern Italian Literature."

This is your last chance to “Deck
Out” before you bid farewell to your
Psych and so forth during the long
awaited Thanksgiving vacation. With
the College Assoc. dance not even a
week away, it’s hi time you started
becoming formal-minded!

Last time we were in print we in-
troduced you to Larry Kaye, remem-
ber? His smart shop is located at
534 Sinithﬁeld Street. In addition to
carrying clever frocks, millinery,
sportswear and coats, he also carries
formals and Sunday nite frocks plus
velvet evening wraps with furred col-
lars. Mama’s little glamour girl can’t
help but sparkle if she arrays herself
in this one particular white, pussy-
willow crepe formal. The low en-
velope decolletage is studded with
rhinestones, bares the shoulders, and
ﬁve tiny straps do the “holding-up.”

A ﬁve-inch split in the center of the
front skirt breaks the dead white
monotony. Then, too, the rhinestone

match. The lovely lustered pearls are
priced at three dollars and look far
more than their price. Speaking of
pearls, we know of nothing better to
top off a formal with than a pearl

back only three dollars, and will be
well worth it when you prove to your-
self what a Fair Lady you can be!

“To err is human.” In the previous
column in describing that “Hail to
Pitt” blue and gold formal, through
some error we neglected to give the
name of the shop at which you might
look at this formal and many others.
We’re sorry. However, lest you may
have forgotten, the formal is Coro-
nation blue trimmed with gold bind-
ing. The gold runs down the front
of the dress, around the ﬂared skirt
and binds the daring low back. The
jacket has a ﬂared peplum, hi neck-
line, and long sleeves. The bows at
the neck are sure beau catchers. The
shop—the Wardrobe, 190 N. Craig
Street; the price—29.75. Other for-
mals start from 17.50. If it’s not a
formal you’re in need of, their street
dresses suit any person and occasion.

If you didn’t get a free manicure
as yet, it’s because you haven’t been
down to Bedell’s on Fifth Avenue,
near Wood Street, to look at their
selection of hats. For dress, small
hats are THE thing. The hats this
season go off at all rakish angles,
feathers may pop up anywhere, and
Turkish turbans add that air of mys-
ticism. The prices are moderate
enough for the average coed, and the
styles are smart enough for the very
sophisticated coed. When you think
of a new hat think of Bedell’s, and
when you think of Bedell’s remember
that you’ll get a manicure absolutely
free.

As presiding judge, Attorney J.
Garﬁeld Houston, Pittsburgh lawyer,

will conduct the trial in usual court
procedure. When both sides have
completed their cases, Attorney

Houston will “charge” the jury.
Fifteen students will make up the

panel from which tonight's jury will

be selected. Three of the ﬁfteen will

be challenged. The ﬁfteen are:
Jeanne Richardson, C40 ; Muriel
Lowy, C40; Miriam Harter, C40;

Howard Engelman, C38; Paul Kro-
mer, C38; Brooks Sipes, C39; Rob-

Fraternities
End Silence
T o mo r r o w

Ladies of the campus fraternity
world will end the silence period of
fall rushing at noon tomorrow.

However, the suspense that is al-
ways built up by fraternities and
their prospects at rushing time will
be over for the fraternities this eye-
ning at 6 o’clock, when pledge lists
are released.

Representatives of the 15 fraterni-
ties will be given their individual
pledge list at the University Club.

Rushees returned ofiicial ballots
designating their fraternity choice to
Heinz House this morning. Since
only, second semester freshmen and
upperclass women were eligible for
fall rushing, Paiihellenic Council con-
ﬁned the activities to one tea. The
results of this rushing will be an-
nounced in Monday’s News.

The plan of deferred rushing fol-
lowed at the University does not per-
mit new freshmen to be rushed until
their second semester, when they are
entertained during a three-day rush-
ing season.

The Inter-Fraternity Sing will take
place this year on November 30, on
which occasion each fraternity will
give a seven-minute skit in competi-
tion for a gold cup.

A Christmas party for all members
of Panhellenic Council is being
planned by the Council’s social com-
mittee. Further arrangements are to
be made at the next Panhellenic
Council meeting.

Dr. Hudnut To Review

U. S. S. R.,” Dr. Herbert B. Hudnut,
pastor of the Bellevue Presyterian
church, will appear before Inquiry
Forum Monday at 12:30 o’clock in
Room 107, Alumni Hall.

Dr. Hudnut has just returned from
Europe, where he spent considerable
time in the Soviet Union, observing
the workings of the Russian plan of
government, especially as it affects
the social life of the people.

The speaker has traveled extensive-
ly in recent years and has addressed
many audiences in this district on his

Varsity "Cro’s‘s-Country Team Meets Navy At Annapolis
Tomorrow As Freshman Griddefrs Terminate Season
With Battle Against Middie Plebes

While an open football date spreads silence over the Pitt

Stadium, Annapolis, Maryland,
ther athletic systems in action

cross-country an-d frosh football, act as guests of Navy to-m«or-

row afteriio-on.

Pitt’s varsity cross-country team
goes over the last hill tomorrow when
the Olsonmen challenge the Navy
harriers over the Annapolis course in
the Panthers’ ﬁnal dual meet of the
season.

Torpedoing in earnest, the Pan-
thers will be out for a victory in or-
der to close out a successful dual sea-

son and to help forget about an “off ’

day” they had last Monday. In dual
competition Pitt has been only beaten
once, that time by the national cham-
pions, Michigan State.

Navy Wants Revenge

Navy was the ﬁnal team that the
Panthers ran against last year and
Pitt rolled out an 18-37 victory over
the -Schenley Park course, Pitt’s home
grounds.

First in that meet was Harold Tost,
a junior from Plumville, Pa. Tost is
a senior this year and has been the
Pitt low man, leading the Pitt pack
in almost every meet. George Cook.
a Tost classmate, was .second. Third
place went to Cecil Bolam of the
Navy.

These three runners will scamper
around the Navy course tomorrow
afternoon. Other Pitt runners to
make the bus trip, which began at 8
o’clock this morning, are Alex Leg-
gin, Al Zamborski, Bob Follette, Ray
Nordstrom, Frank Bonurati and Ed-
ward Novak, manager.

Corach Carl Olson will remain in
Pittsburgh to handle the state inter-
scholastics that the University is
sponsoring. Assistant Coach James
Potts will direct the group in his ab-
sence.

Frosh Footballers Close Season

Inanother season ﬁnale at the same
place and at the same time, Coach
Mike Milligan’s Panther Cub grid-
ders battle the Middie plebes in their
annual game. The Little Admirals
enter the game as favorites and with
grim intent to make up for the 33-7
shellacking by last year’s Pitt frosh.

After a shutout at the hands of
the Mountaineers at Fairmont, Ar-
mistice Day, 20-0, the yearlings are
all set for a comeback at the expense
of the Annapolis gridders.

There will be little difference in
the little Panther lineup when they
tackle the Miniature Middies. Dick-
inson, captain of the team, who has
been playing a great game at right
end, will hold that position tomor-
row, Farkus is slated for the oppo-
site end of the line. Foltz and Kris-
tufek appear at the tackle posts,
while Shord at center and Corace
and Pennypacker at guards ﬁnish off
a 179—po.und average line.

Backﬁeld assignments are also the
same as for the West Virginia tilt,
with Goodell at fullback, Cassiano
and Pastin at halfback, and Marie at
quarterback.

CE’s Want ‘Real’ Game

More Boxing Candidates-

WANTED—By Jack Schricker,
boxing coach, at least ten more
boxing candidates, heavyweights
preferred. And there lies the only
drawback in the ring mentor’s fast-
moving training program.

“As usual there is a scarcity in
the heavier divisions,” said Schrick-
er yesterday, “but aspirants for all
. classes will ﬁnd themselves in a
.» wide open battle for positions.”
'' He requested that all new men
report to the Stadium quarters
any afternoon after 2:30 o’clock.

Kappa Sigs
Win Phi Ep

Tilt With Phi Delts, Last
Year Champs, Monday
Ends Semi-Finals

Intramural officials ﬁnally brought
‘the Kappa Sig and the Phi Ep touch
football teams together for their long
delayed second round gridiron bat-
tle. During the long delay or some-
where in the shuffle, the Phi Ep boys
lost something after their tie game
with the Kappa Sigs last week, for
over in the Schenley Oval Tuesday
afternoon the Kappa Sigs proved
themselves strictly money players by
whipping the Phi Eps, 15-6.

It was another one of those typi-
cal Phi Ep—Kappa Sig classics. On
the opening play of the game, Phi
Ep Jack Young tossed a long pass
to Jack Kotler to put the ball deep
in Kappa Sig territory. From here
Mac Marks riﬂed a short pass to
Young, who scampered over the goal
for Phi Ep’s six points.

Three Minutes To Play!

This seemed to make the Dithridge
Street lads mad. A few minutes later
Charley Groat, Kappa Sigma’s All-
Frat candidate, turned left end for
the tying touchdown, and the game
stayed tied until three minutes before
the ﬁnal whistle of the game, when
Kappa Sigma turned on the power
and scored nine points in quick
fashion.

Up to the ﬁnal three minutes the
two teams had played 77 minutes of
touch football to a tie score, includ-
ing last week’s tie game. Groat
started the rally and provided the
winning points when he intercepted
a Phi Ep pass and ran 50 yards for
a touchdown. Andy Moffet made the
extra point. Two more Kappa Sig
points came on the following play.
Monday the Kappa Sigs meet the
Phi Delts in the semi-ﬁnal of their
league. The winner of this game will
battle the Phi Gams, the other league
winner, in the ﬁnals on Tuesday aft-

ernoon.

Zehfuss Sta

Cage Drills At Stadium

 

Squad Ends First Week"s
Workout; Varsity Wins
Practice Game

About thirty or forty ambitious
freshmen, dressed in shorts and jer-
seys, strolled out on the Stadium gym
court last Monday afternoon to re-

port to Coach Paul Zehfuss for fresh—'

man basketball practice. Although
the varsity has been in shorts and
jerseys for several weeks, Monday
was the first session for the yearling
cagers.

The squad will be cut to one small
enough for Zehfuss, sole coach for the
ﬁrst year men, to handle. He hopes
to have the group cut by the end of
Thanksgiving vacation into a tenta-
tive squad.

The frosh held practice Tuesday
and Thursday and will have another
session today. Next week practice
will fall on Tuesday, and Friday and
Saturday mornings to be followed the
week after Thanksgiving by practice
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Some of the freshman candidates
showing form are Louis Mendlow, of
Duquesne; Jimmy McCance, Bellevue;
Bill Edmunds, Dormont; Matt Null,
Sykesville; Bob Johnson, Swissvale;
George Wood, Kane; George Hart-
man, Homestead; Howard Lyons,
Crafton; Jim Shaffer, New Castle;

rts Frosh

Charles Ptacek, Pittsburgh; Jack
Scherer, Glassport; Dan McCarthy,
St. _Mary’s of the Mount; George
Davies, Wilkinsburg; Joe Kristufek,
Mclieesport; Francis Vernallis, Bent-
leyville, and Dave Saunders of Pitts-
burgh. Most of these fellows played
high school ball and were entered in
Carlson’s recent novice tournament.

_P1tt’s varsity has been clicking
right along, playing their ﬁrst prac-
tice game last Tuesday evening up in
the Stadium court when it met and
defeated the Wilmerding A. C., a fast
local amateur club. It will probably
have another practice game on next
Tuesday to be followed by one a
week later. The opponents have not
yet been decided upon.

This practice fray was not the
ﬁrst workout they have had as a team
as they have been having inter-club
contests for the past two weeks. Dr.
Carlson has been dividing his squad
of eleven men into two squads for the
inter-club tilts in an effort to ﬁnd a
combination that will work well to-

Battle, 15-6 2

Weather cold enough to make the
Panther run did just that yesterday
afternoon for Martin J. Feely’s sec-
ond annual Panther Run. The results‘
of the Run sounds like an all-'frater-
nity convention for, after ruling -out
freshman cross -country runners as
ineligible, Greeks alone remained.

First place went to Fred Treden-
nick, PiKA who completed the circuit
in something under seven minutes.
Ken Ryden, sole Delt to run, followed
close behind, while Dorand, Lambda
Chi dogged him to wind up in the
third position. Heuple, another PiKA,
helped their team points by tallying
fourth. The Kappa Sigs believe in stay-
ing together and it must be a good
idea for they again cinched the team
cup by placing the next four men.
Ed Beachler, ‘Gordy Rauch, Bell, and
Jim Shields crossed the ﬁnish line in
that order for the honor of Kappa
Sigma. Bill Hoeveler came in a lucky
13th to complete the team and run
the Kappa Sig points to a total of
39

Placing ﬁve men in the ﬁrst twen-
ty to ﬁnish put the Lambda Chis in
second place with 53 points. PiKA,

I'll Take Two Lumps, Pleasel

ONIGHT THE REPUTED cream of the University mixes

with perhaps one of the more important outside factors of any
University. Starting at eight o’clock, Dr. John'G. Bowman, ad-
ministration and faculty supplementing, stages quite an affair atop
Memorial Hall for the parents of freshmen, gathered there. Up-
perclassmen and women, with more cream, participate and will
perhaps even stir a little sugar in the direction of a few faculty
booths, provided they are within dunking range.

Most of the sugar, however, will be saved for the guests of
the evening, the parents. It will all be very ﬁne, from the back-
less formals of lovely girls with cake, cream, and perhaps even a
little tea or coffee—to the boys who are lucky enough to catch a
dusky corner position in mid-balcony.

But we all like sugar, especially if our coffee has been roasted,
toasted, boasted. Ephraim and Merebell have perhaps passed
through just that process. Upperclassmen, for the most part, con-
ducted the roasting parties for the Ephraims and Merebells with
perhaps even a few toasting parties were staged for the former
during the recent rush period.

Most freshmen, single-handedly, took care of the last process,
boasting, with a personal delight. However, most of them have
passed through the “grinder.” If they have been well ground, then
their kettles shall have “perked” and perhaps be ready for a bit

of sugar.

But if the “grounds” are still hard and rough, they will be
put on a really hot fire or may be shoved through a ﬁne “grinder”
when parents step in for their share of the inquisition procedure.

We hope most parents ﬁnd their Epes and Meres with full

cups that are ready for sweetening—to mix with the cream. ‘How-
ever, to those who perhaps may feel a lump rise slowly in the
throat when the messages arrive, as contrasted to those who may
be able to drink a lump that slowly dissolves as it is taken, we say
there is still much time. ,

Often a freshman ﬁnds it difficult to become adjusted to the
shifting, changing life of the ﬁrst-year student. A sen1or'year
in high school is sometimes poor preparation for what is to
come in the ﬁrst year of college. The transition may be slowed
by the backwardness or forwardness of the freshman. In other
cases, the circumstances are uncontrollable. Background often
is lacking. Until some of that has been secured through periods
of orientation, research, or special training, the road is rough.

It is not the most satisfactory thing to learn that your son
does not, at the present time, measure up to others in his group.
This may be due to lack of ability, but in nine-tenths of the cases
can be traced to lack of preparation, study, or concentration. Per-
haps an outside inﬂuence is responsible for the situation. If work,
that is excess work, is necessary to provide an opportunity for
attendance, then it is questionable if the cost is worthwhile. It is
worth the health and effort of only a few exceptions to pay the
cost of excessive outside employment.

It is a big job to make the most of what our Universities and
Colleges offer today. Students entering the tercentenary year of
this University should be well aware of that fact. However, a
school can only offer opportunity to learn. Students must ﬁrst of
all desire to learn, and then do something constructive about that
desire.

One other point, many times a student earning a “C” in a
course receives more than the “A” student for the same work.
The thing is relative, and depends a great deal on the individual.
Average work represents good Work for a large percentage of the
ﬁrst-year class. Above-average usually indicates superior—attain-
ment, yet may not be a criterion as to what has been received.

There is still a great deal of time for an acceptable ﬁnish. Re-
member, there are many who get along admirably well in this world
without any sugar. And they like it . . . that way.

No Greek Chapter Here

HEN_ THERE’S the one about the freshman who, after viewing

the University’s 41-story Cathedral of Learning school house,
breezed into the lobby of Hotel Schenley, next door, and told the
clerk that while he “hadn’t met all the fellows yet” he thought
he’d like “to pledge up, anyhow,” since he’d taken such a liking
to the place.”

H-mmm, Yes, Those Papers I Owe You!
A LONG ABOUT THIS time many of us are in much the same

shape as the immortal Dean, the “Dizzy” one, who after being
“beaned” by a hot belt from the hat of the Philly’s Watkins last
summer, awoke in the dressing room several minutes later with the
classic, “Why ain’t I pitchin’?”

Cardwell

Vocal Unit
Performs

Singers Of Negro Spirituals
From School Of Music
Entertain Students

By Robert Brown

Some reviewers have a habit of
exhausting all of the adjectives in the
English language to describe con-
certs. But practically all that need
be said about the performance of the
Cardwell Singers presented here last
Wednesday is that it fully measured
up to everything that was expected
of it.

There was little doubt in the minds
of the 150 students who heard Mary
Cardwell Dawson and her choral so-

ciety from the Cardwell School of
Music that the group was “tops” In
its particular ﬁe1d———interpreting Ne-
gro spirituals.

Sound Musical Taste

In its presentation of the old songs
of the Negro race there was evi-
dent good, sound musical taste, deli-
cate shading, well balanced program
notes, proper subordination of solo
parts, and a wise selection of num-
bers. In fact, the only ﬂaw appar-
ent was a slight intonality evident
in Stephen Collins Foster’s “Come
Where My Love Lies Dreaming,” but
this was such a triﬂing matter that
only a musical purist would ﬁnd any
fault with it.

The number most popular with the
audience was, perhaps, Mrs. Dawson’s
“Great Gettin’ Up In the Mornin’.”
The sure swing of the music and
the enthusiasm which the choral
showed in the presentation of it made
a sure-ﬁre hit with everyone present.

Women Score Hit

But the other numbers were all
equally well done. The women’s sec-
tion of the society scored with Jack-
son’s “Certainly, Lord,” and the ever
popular “Joshua at the Battle of Jer-
icho” was built up to a close that
made observers wonder that 14 sing-
ers could achieve such stirring ef-
fects. The simple yet effective chord-
ing of “Deep River” conclusively
proved once more that true music
need not be a vacant display of vir-
tuosity.

I still have two inches of copy left,
so it might not be amiss to congratu-
late William Stark, C38, in particular,
and SFA, in general, for initiating the
new series of concert hours and book
chats that struck a new high in cul-
tural activities at the University, if
the Cardwell Singers are to be taken
for an example. They are sure to
be well received by the student body.

Letter To
Editors

November 18, 1936.
Editor, The Pitt News,

Dear Sir:

I write this letter in a spirit of pro-
test. I considered a long time before
doing so, for fear of adding my name
to the list of cranks, quacks, and those
otherwise mentally deﬁcient who like
to see their “John Doe” in print. But
the time is past for personal consid-
erations; I speak now for the good
If the group.

Winter is at hand. From three
years’ experience, I have noticed
among the students and faculty of
this University a deplorable habit of
sealing themselves hermetically in
the classrooms with windows shut and
door closed. While the professor pro-
ceeds in his lecture, some 50 students

inhale, exhale with painful regular-
ity. By this count of noses, it would
seem that the professor fails to take
part in this natural function.

He seems unaware of the fact that
as the hour progresses, the supply of
good air in the room decreases; as
the supply of good air decreases,
scholarship lags, even in the midst of
some frenzy of inspiration. I have
come into the rooms where the win-
dows have been so misted I have been
unable to see out, and where the air
has been so fetid and poor, that it
took real courage to cross the ﬂoor to
open the windows.

I have been in class rooms where,
because of the heat and the thick
atmosphere, I have become so drowsy
and stupid that I could barely keep
my eyes open.

Now I ask you: Is this an intelli-
gent way to meet our common prob-
lem? There is no proper ventilating
system to provide for an intake of
fresh air nor for an outlet of stale
air. Then, must we necessarily “stew
in our own juice” because some in-
structor fails to provide a proper ad-
justment of the windows? I, myself,
would hate to break into his lecture
to remind him of his duty, but I can’t
stand much more of present condi-
tions. That is why I write this letter
—in hopes of getting some sort of
united action.

What has become of our health
service? While warning us against
colds, they are supinely indifferent to
this pernicious factor that only in-
creases our susceptibility.

And you too, Mr. Editor. Could you
for one day, at least, turn from your
campaign for united action in the
cheering section to a drive for a sane
and healthier atmosphere in the
classroom? Better yet, could you give
us of your services a whole week in
which to make the campus “air
minded”? This would indeed be a real,
constructive service.

Sincerely yours,

RAY MAIZE, ’38.

Climaxing a series of events intro-
ducing freshman women to Univer-
sity life, the Women’s Debating As-
sociation and Women’s Choral enter-
tained at the annual Beaux Arts
Salon Wednesday night at Heinz
House.

Mr. Peter J oray, who traveled over
from the Pittsburgh Playhouse, and
Miss Georgia Orwig, well known in
Pittsburgh music circles, were guest
artists for the evening. Mr. Joray
presented several character sketches
and Miss Orwig, piano selections.

The guests were introduced by Miss
Theresa Kahn, instructor in English
and coach of Women’s Debating, who
also talked on ﬁne arts. Student en-
tertainers were June Greene, Ed38,
and Peggy Donley, C39, dancers.
Members of Women’s Choral sang
two groups of songs.

Three Previous Affairs

The ﬁrst freshman event, and prob-
ably the most impressive and oldest
of the traditional ceremonies, was
Lantern Night which took place the
ﬁrst Wednesday night of the semes-
ter. Freshman women, with their
mentors, gathered on Thaw Hall
green to watch the ritual of light and
to be welcomed into the University by
Father Pitt.

Following this ceremony, the women
lighted their candles from the tapers
of the candlebearers and proceeded up
University Drive to Heinz House
where with Alma Mater they took
part in a ritual in which they pledged
loyalty to the University. This was
WSGA’s welcome to the class of 1940.

hostess to the first year women at the

male which would make the Parisian
fashioner sit up and take notice, and
escorted by upperclassmen attired in

the latest according to Esquire, they
gathered at the University Club to
enjoy the evening of entertainment
and dancing and to vie for honors by
wearing blue and gold crepe paper
hats which they had designed and
made themselves.

Of a more serious nature was the
Hearth Ceremony. This ceremony,
patterned after one of ancient Rome,
signiﬁes the kindling of inextinguish-
able friendship. It marked the light-
ing of the ﬁre in the Heinz House
ﬁreplace for the ﬁrst time this year
and was the welcome accorded to
freshman women by the YWCA and
YWHA.
