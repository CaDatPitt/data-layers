Smith Announces
Moustache Story

“A truly startling and spec-
tacular. (wait and see) ‘His-
tory of. M.0us_taches_’ will be
featured by tomorrow’s issue
of; the. Pitt .P.anther_,” says
Tom Smith, C39‘, acting edi-
tor, _

The: story willbe illustrated by
authentic photographs which will
suggest moustache styles that
might -possibly be. worn ;by campus
leaders. Frank Miller has really
done an exhaustive piece of‘ re-
searchinto the history of the soup
strainer. and the result, is quite
unusual.

Women to Attend
‘Bal Mistiqne’

“Bal Mistique" makes its debut
tomorrow night at the Hotel
Schenley.

All that is known of the aﬂair
is that it is a new event for
freshman women to replace the
traditional Coed Prom. The
young ladies, accompanied by
their mentors, are to meet at the
Hotel Schenley at 7 o'clock.

They will wear summer formals,
black masks, and French doll
hats fashioned from blue and
gold crepe paper. Any girl with-
out a mask will not be admitted.

What happens then is a mys-
tery.

Umble Sets Debate
Meetings for Today

Roy H. Umble, coach of men’s
debating, has announced that the
varsity and freshman deb ate
squads will meet today at 1:30
o’clock and 3 o’clock respectively,
in 1617 Cathedral.

Discussing practice in parlia-
mentary procedure for student ac-
tivities leaders, the varsity squad
will also hold a symposium on a
proposed alliance with Great Bri-
tain.

At present, Bernard McKenna,
C39, debate manager for the squad,
is working with Mr. Umble on the
program for this year. A series of
varsity demonstration debates will
be held October 23, November 13
and 27, at New Kensington before
members of the Aluminum Work-
ers of America.

All freshmen who were unableto
attend last Tuesday’s meeting are
invited to attend the freshman
meeting today.

 

StudentiTravelerMaintains
European People Peaceful

Europeans are more peaceful’?

than we think they are, says Wil-
liam Murphy, C39, who returned to
the University last week after a
ﬁve-week tour of Europe.

After. making a Mediterranean
cruise, Murphy visited Italy, Switz-
erland, Germany, Czechoslovakia,
France, and England during the
recent crisis.

American newspapers did a mas-
terly job in recreating the situa-
tion abroad compared to the work
of foreign publications, he says.

Of special interest to him was
his stay in Prague three weeks ago,
when he saw Czechs building for-
tiﬁcations and anti-gas chambers.
He found the Czechoelovakcapital,
“a city of patriots. preparing to
withstand, any move. of Hitler's.”
Every male citizen was prepared
to report to a mobilization base
within six hours, because they all
felt that Russia was coming to
their aid.

“Germany was the nicest coun-
try I was in," ventures Murphy.
"With living expenses extremely
cheap, the people friendly, and ev-
erything so clean, I didn't mind the
‘isolation’ created by the slaughter-
ing of world news items by cen-
son-"

AC;

The only foreign news that
Murphy could read in the main
paper of Berlin, a six-page gov-
ernment publication, was the ac-
count of “the massacres of Sude-
tens.”

Sale of the London-published
“Herald-Tribune” was prohibited
in Germany immediately after Hit-
ler’s Nuremberg speech, be related.

“Mistreatments of Sudetens, al-
though grossly exaggerated by the
German press, were cornmon oc-
currences, said Murphy. “One of
these was the denying of Sudeten
representation in the Czech parlia-
ment. It seems that although these
‘Congressmen’ were duly elected by
their people, legal technicalities,
imposed by the ruling Czechs, pre-
vented their participation in the
assembly."

“From those to whom I spoke
in the various European countries
I gathered that the people as a
whole did not want to ﬁght. The

only example of war enthusiasm7

took place in London, where a gi-
gantic throng assembled in Hyde
Park and booed Chamberlain upon
his ﬂrst return from Germany.”

I-F Meeting Postponed

The regular meeting of Inter-
fraternity Council, scheduled for
today, has been postponed be-
cause of rushing week activities.
A special meeting will be called
as soon as possible, according to
Robert R. Corley, assistant.

C-G Members Sell
Tickets for Formal

Tickets went on sale yesterday
for the first formal of the year, the
Undergraduate Cap and Gown
Club's dance to be held Friday eve-
ning, October 21, in the Hotel
Schenley. Members of the club are
selling the tickets, priced at two
dollars a couple.

Max Adkins and his Airliners
will provide the dance rhythms, it
was announced today by Richard
Frankel, C39 social chairman, and
Tom Smith, C39, business manager.

Adkins’ orchestra is heard regu-
larly over radio station WCAE,
and he has become well known on
the campus through his arrange-
ments of music for the Cap and
Gown shows. Music from past Cap
and Gown shows will be featured
by the orchestra as part of the eve-
nings’ entertainment.

Another feature of the dance in-
troduced by the club is the “no
corsage” plan. “We feel,” Frankel
said, “that this idea will be a great
help to many freshmen who have
the expense of purchasing tuxedos
and full dress suite at this time,
and for other students whose ex-

‘penses are usually quite heavy at

this time of the year.”

Pitt Easily Beats Duquesne  
In Bitter Battle, 27-0

Another skirmish in Fogville’s civil football warfare was fought Sat-
. . . only it wasn’t altogether civil.
That gang of rebels from over on the Bluff apparently marched up
with intentions of either blasting through Pitt's “Maginot Line” or at
least crippling the touchdown advance of Dr. Jock Sutherland’s choice
troops. There is some question as to which phase of these outlined ob-

‘TEE

offensive way themselves, the best
the Dukes could do was to gain
one first down—that by a forward
pass against the Panther reserves.
As for crimping the Pitt score-

27-0 for the unbeaten Panthers.

But, in the matter of showing a
lot of fight, Duquesne dfd that. The
only debatable point is what kind
of fight it was that Clipper Smith's
mob of Night Riders brought into
the battle.

That it was a hard, bitterly-fought
game, the aftermath shows clearly.
Pitt came out of the contest in a
more bruised condition than they
emerged from the combined first
two games. Al Lezouski, hit on a
block, sustained a nerve injury in
the muscles of his back. Just when
he will be able to resume his play-
ing position is as yet undetermined.
Stebbins, Dickinson, Cassiano,
and Hoffman received their share
of the battering, but will very
likely not lose any playing time
because of it.

For the ﬁrst time this season the
Panthers showed to a certain ex-

. tent the ﬂexibility of their attack.

Taking advantage of the Duquesne
mass defense, Chickerneo called for
more passes than Pitt has been
prone to use in a good many Sat-
urdays. And they were successful.
The Panthers took to the air-way
18 times. Twice this procedure
brought touchdowns.

Both scoring throws were made
by Marshall Goldberg, who seems
to do things just right when it
comes to making touchdowns. First
he heaved to Stebbins from the

117 ATWOOD at FORBES STREET

J. P. SMITH

Duke 11-yard line late in the ﬁrst
quarter and then he threw a ﬂat
pass to Bill Daddio, deep in the
end zone, on the last scrimmage
play of the game.

Goldberg had his hand in another
one of the scores. This time he
used his hand to carry the ball over
instead of throwing it over. It was
in the middle of the third quarter.
Pitt had the ball on the Duke two-
yard spot after Cassiano had been
grabbed by Onder when he was
about to reach for a pass that he
couldn’t have gotten, anyway.

This ﬂagrant rule violation gave
Pitt the ball at the point of inter-
ference. Mad Marshall cut through
right tackle for the touchdown
without so much as a Duke touch
ing him. »

Dashing Dick Cassiano accounted
for the other Panther six-points.
Six minutes after play commenced
he cut back through the right side
of the line. Bill Daddio kicked three
perfect points after touchdown,
missing the last try.

Up to the time of the first Cassi-
ano touchdown, Pitt’s ﬁrst team
was the same close-to-perfect foot-
ball unit that it had been in Phila-
delphia the preceding week. It was
given the football on the 40-yard
mark and it proceeded to stampede
right down to the goal line without
interruption and with correct
blocking.

But, after that score, it seemed
to be a different playing group.
There appeared to be a let-down.
The team became lax for the ﬁrst
time this year. For four consecu-
tive marches, three from last week,
it was a team that couldn’t be
stopped and wasn't stopped. There-
fore, the let-up after the opening
touchdown, is understandable.

Dr. Sutherland’s second team
was given further actual scrim-
maging. In certain places it was
improved. In others there was no
change. This was, chieﬂy, in the
matter of poise. This reserve group,
next year’s team, still has a long
way to go towards gaining assur-
ance in its offensive maneuvering.

This should comewith the aging.

Owl Continues Subscription
Campaign with 50 Salesmen

Kairys Urges Seniors
To Visit Photographer

With almost 50 salesmen on
campus, and the 1939 Owl avail-
able for a down payment of only
three dollars, seniors have a
chance to purchase their yearbooks
and make appointments with Gim-
bel’s fourth ﬂoor Photo-Reﬂex stu-

dios immediately, announces Al
Kairys, BA39, acting business
manager.

Although the senior subscrip-
tion campaign will run for several
weeks, Kairys says it is advisable
for seniors to buy their yearbooks
as soon as possible and to make
early appointments for photos.
Blue and gold Owl ribbons identify
all salesmen.

Seniors can buy their books on
a down—payment plan and receive
identification cards for portrait
appointments. The ﬁve dollar sen-
ior price of the Owl includes four
portrait proofs.

According to Acting Editor
Harold Viehman, C39, the Owl
this year will feature the local cul-
tural heritages as expressed in the
atmosphere of the Commons Room
and its surrounding nationality
rooms.

Recreational activities include
