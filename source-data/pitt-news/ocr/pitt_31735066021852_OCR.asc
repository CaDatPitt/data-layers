Graduation marks Pitt's 200th

The’ University of Pittsburgh
conferred more than 6,700
bachelor, graduate and profes-
sional degrees at its Bicentennial
Commencement Convocation in
the Civic Arena on Sunday.

The '1987 commencement
speakerlwas the Rev. Theodore
M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., retired
president of the University of
Notre Dame.

Hesburgh spoke on the grow-
ing number of ethnic minorities
in the United States and how they
are increasingly becoming a
poor, permanent underclass..

”This is alarge’ percentage of
America's human capital that is
right now underdeveloped and
underutilized, at a time when our

productive and competitive.

posture is threatened worldwide.

We are actually in serious danger V

of becoming a second or third-

rate nation. Only better educa-

V tion can turn this tide.

”Great urban universities such

as Pitt will have to lead the way,

for they are where the problem is,
in the great urban centers. They
must reach down to the pre-

school, elementary and see con— _

dary schools to improve perfor-
mance or they will se their own
share of a shrinking baby—bust
population shrink further,” said

’ Hesburgh.

The University of Pittsburgh
commencement ceremonies
marked the final event in the”
year-long observance of its 200th
anniversary. During the ceremo-
ny, Pitt President Wesley W. Pos-
var presented Hesburgh with an
honorary degree as Doctor of
Public Service — his 112th

7 honorary -degree and a world

record for such honors.
During the ceremony, Posvar
alsoawarded the University Bi-

centennial Medallions of Distinc-
tion to five Pitt alumni.
Themedallions are awarded to

"alumni whose scholarship,

leadership and service have
brought honor to the University.

_Meda|lions were awarded to
JoAnne Boyle, president-elect of

-Seton Hill College;».Malvin R.

Goode, pioneering black TV
reporter; Norman H. Horowitz, a
scientist who has extensively
studied the planet Mars; Stephen
H. Rhinesmith, coordinator of
President Reagan's U.S.—Soviet
Exchange Initiative-, and David
M. Roderick, chairman and chief
executive officer of USX Corpo-
ration. Q

As part of its graduation exer-
cises, Pitt also gave a special
Mother's Day gift,— a bicenten-
nial orchid Corsage — to the
mother‘ of each graduating Pitt
student attending commence-
ment exercises.

Neon graces union;

cost rumors clarified 

By Teresa Candori
Managing Editor

The neon sculpture, ”Tree of
Knowledge” was dedicated in
the William Pitt Union Atrium on
Thursday, but speculation about

the cost of the, sculpture was not.

until recently resolved.

Please see editorial, page 4

Commissioned by the 1986
Student Government Board, the
cost of the sculpture, was
$19,860; however an agreement
to keep the artist's fee confiden-
tial hadlresulted in rumors of the
fee being as high as $50,000.

Joyce Giangarlo, SGB advisor
and Acting Director of Student
Activities, said yesterday that the
money for the sculpture came
from student activities fees, but
she had originally promised artist

‘Jane Haskell not to divulge the

exact amount.

‘At the dedication ceremony on
Thursday, 1986 SGB member
Monique Sims said the sculpture
had cost approximately $25,000.

Nancy Wright, spokeswoman
for Haskell, said it is common

' practice.in the art world to_ keep

an-artist's fees confidential.

’’If the purchaser wishes to
make it public,‘ that is their
perogative, but it is not consi-

dered in good taste,” Wright said. '

Haskell was unavailable for
comment at presstime. .

SGB president Phil Moyer,
who was a member of the Allo-
cations Committee when the

sculpture was commissioned,
said the SGB asked the commit-
tee for $5,000 in late October.
He said the approval for the rest
of the money did not go through
the allocations committee.
According to Giangarlo, » the
original funding was handled by
Andy Smith, former'SCB advisor

and director of student activities. a

Presented to the university by
the SGB in honor of the bicenten-
nial, the sculpture depicts the

Cathedral of Learning, represent-

ing the university; the’panther,
the university's mascot represent-

ing the students and a’ tree of- '

knowledge, each different
colored branch of which
represents the fourteen different
disciplines of the university. ,
According to Haskell, the tree
is not growing out of the pan-
ther’s back. Rather the panther is

supporting the tree, representing a 1

that the disciplines are supported

by and draw their strength from _‘

the students.

Though the sculpture was ‘com- -:

missioned by last year's SGB,_

Moyer presented the sculpture to  ’

University President Wesley Pos—' S

var._ Moyer said, ”The student‘

”|’ve heard that it looks good

the amount of time the lobby was

— it was inconvenient to walk.

around it all that time.”

 Zelenakl

”The work itself looks like an
unfinished sketch..I think the idea
of presenting it‘as a gifteto the
university was very nice. I can't
say whether it cost too much‘ be-
cause I don't know how much
neon costs. It's a different piece

’’I think it's eye-catching. It is
a very good piece of art. If they
did pay $25,000, that doesn't
bother me. The price doesn't,

' bother me at all. It's very well

constructed. But the tree looks
like its growing out of the pan-

’’I think they could have spent
the money on something else. All

THE PI1T News, Wednesday May 13, 1987

McFarlane testifies; denies lrangate coverup  

WASHINGTON —— Former Na-
tional Security Adviser Robert
McFar|ane denied today that he
and other key officials in the Iran-
Contra affair agreed on a cover
story last November to keep
potentially damaging details hid-

V den from official investigators.

McFar|ane replied with a firm
”No,” when asked whether he,
former National Security Adviser
John M. Poindexter and former
National Security Council aide Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North decided
together to say they were una-
ware that Israel was shipping U.S-
made missiles to Iran in Novem-
ber 1985 in an attempt to win the

' freedom of U.S. hostages.

In other developments, retired

Air Force Maj. G_en. Richard V. A

Secord said in a broadcast-inter-
view that North gave three Irani-
ans a late-night tour of the White
House last September.

At a picture-taking session to-
day at the White House, Reagan
was asked if he personally had
sought contributions from other
countries for the Contras.

”I’ve said that I'm not going to

‘answer any questions on those
things until this is over,” Reagan

said. ”If I were going to answer

any questions, I'd say no.”

2nd transplant center

PITTSBURGH —— Allegheny
General Hospital received state
Health Department approval to
become the second heart trans-
plant center. in Pittsburgh, a
spokeswoman for the hospital
said.

The approval came Monday
from officials in Harrisburg, said
the spokeswoman, Marty Walsh.

Allegheny General's heart
transplant program will be direct-
ed by Dr. George Magovern Jr.,
34, son of the hospital's top heart
surgeon. The younger Magovern
trained for nine years as a heart
surgeon at_Johns Hopkins Hospi-
tal in Baltimore.

The city's only other heart
transplant center is Presbyterian-
University Hospital.

Reagan to abide by
pro-Iranian ruling

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan has decided to comply
with an order by an internation-
al claims court and return more
than $450 million in frozen assets
to Iran, the State Department said
Tuesday.

The Iran-United States Claims
Tribunal last week ordered the
return ofl$451.4 million which
the United States has conceded
belongs to Iran. At the urging of
the United States, the tribunal
based in the Dutch capital of The
Hague stressed that the return of
the funds was not connected with
the fate of American hostages
held in Lebanon.

Mother charged with

son ’s death released

BROOMALL, Pa. — A mother
was charged Tuesday with fatal-
ly shooting her 2-year-old child,
a retarded boy beloved by neigh-
bors who helped with his care,
authorities said.

Irene Bernstein, 41, surren-
dered to police and was ar-
raigned at 5:25 p.m. on charges
of homicide and first- and third-
degree murder, District Justice
Maureen Fitzpatrick said.

The mother was released on
$25,000 cash bail.

THE PITT NEWS, ‘Wednesday May 13, 1987

Pitt awaiting funding

Assistant News Editor

Pitt's 1987-88 budget proposal
requests a total 21.8 percent in-
crease of state funds to be dis-
tributed within Pitt's Base Budget
and Programs for Progress.
However, Governor Casey
recommends only a 5 percent in-
crease. .

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
expects funding legislation to be
passed in mid-June. He said that
he is not surprised by the increase
supported by the governor.
”That’s quite common. That's the
way the system usually works;
the state government comes up
with much less than what people
feel they need.

”The reality [of] what the state
comes up with and provides is in
terms of what's available,” said
Posvar. -

Administrators expect inflation
to increase four percent over the
1987 fiscal year. Full—time enroll-
ment is estimated to remain sta-
ble at approximately 35,000
students for the next two fiscal
years. Tuition costs will continue
to rise due to inflation and insuffi-
cient funding, unless a significant
increase in state funding is estab-
lished.

According to the proposal, a 7
percent increase for faculty and
staff salaries was requested to
”sustain the university's competi-
tive position in attracting and re-
taining excellent faculty and
staff.” .

decision from capitol

. By Marc Duchin

Programs for Progress makes
up 7 percent of the total state
funds requested by Pitt. These
programs create partnerships
with industry and with federal,
state and local governments to
”promote the economic de-
velopement of western Penn-
sylvania.”

”[Programs for Progress] is an
investment in enterprises that will
create new jobs. What we get
from the state will be fixed; how
we spend it will be flexible,” said
Posvar. ”There are certain
categories of the proposal that are
fixed, like student aid and minori-
ty programs, but nearly all of our
budget is under general
operation.”

Phil Moyer, student govern-
ment president, said he will
launch a lobbying campaign to
Harrisburg to raise more funds for
research institutions like Pitt,
Temple and Penn State.

”Right now, the level of fund-
ing is absolutely atrocious com-
pared to other state schools,” said
Moyer.

”[The 5 percent increase] is the
position of the governor's ad-
ministration,” said Posvar. ”We
hope to get that raised — but it's
a |ongshot.”

Yesterday, President Posvar
flew to Harrisburg to meet with
the state board of the governor's
new economic development
partnership, which consists of
leaders‘ of labor, industry and
education.

Pressing a raw,
sensational nerve

’’I promise to be faithful to my wife” should never appear
as a plank on a political platform. The mere suggestion of it
is ridiculous. Up until last week, that is. —

To The Miami Herald, marital fidelity is a key issue. In order
to sell more papers, a group of enterprising reporters staked

out Gary Hart's Washington, D.C., townhouse and wrote a story '

about it. They reported that a little-known actress spent ”Fri-
day night and most of Saturday” there. What has followed is
a sex scandal that pales in comparison to the Bakker fiasco.

Less than a week after the story broke, Gary Hart withdrew
his candidacy. A few days on the hot seatwas just too l‘mu"c‘h
for him to handle.

Can anyone blame him, though? Members of the press have
overstepped their bounds once again. An alleged affair has noth-
ing to do with a politician's ability to do the job.

John Kennedy is a prime example of that. While he was presi-
dent, he allegedly slept with many, many women to whom he
was not married, yet we remember him asone of the greatest
presidents of our time. Along those same lines, Jimmy Carter

‘ was a devoted family man.  r

The Miami Herald has dragged down the profession of jour-
nalism. They've only proven that sensationalism doesn't stop
in supermarket check-out aisles.

It's big, it's tacky,
it's thelatest thing

it's finished.

The main lobby of the William Pitt Union is now adorned
with the newest trend in sculpture — expensive neon.

For $25,000, if indeed that was the cost, the students, faculty
and staff here have gained the inestimable pleasure of viewing
a stylization of a tree, the Cathedral of Learning and a panther.

We are left wondering why. Why was so much of the univer-
sity’s money spent on something so trivial? Why were the colors
of the union ignored in the sculpture’s design?-Why is the tree
growing out of the back of the panther? '

There was a comment that the tree symbolzed the disiciplines
at Pitt, and the panther represented the students who support
the branches of knowledge. Could it also be that the panther
represents those who chose to commission the multi-colored

' . farce?

The sculpture seems mired in fashion and forced symbolism,

intruding on what was once the calmest space on campus.

The William Pitt Union has a long and colorful history, as
does Pitt. Decorated with quiet blue and dusty mauve, the stu-
dent union provides an elegant and austere place for the stu-
dents to congregate, as well as a place to hold official university
functions. How would the bicentennial celebration have looked
were its formality framed in the colors of the most popular Jams?

It is a pity that the grace of the building has been compromised
by an aggressive and trite collection of neon. It is a pity that
the students will be forced to live with the superficialities of
today's fashions foryears to come. V '

The other day l was reading
about the ethics and goals of jour-
nalism. The author of the article
asserted that journalists are some-
where between saints and saviors
in their commitment to the com-
mon good.

Now, isn’t that special? '

And isn't that the biggest load
of crap you've heard in a while,

maybe even since an American ,

hero told us he was. not a crook?
Let's think for a moment about
the role of the journalist in our
society.
As I understand it, a journalist

is supposed to look deep into the

truth of the matter. Truly.

if we believe that, and we be-
lieve there is any possibility that
a person who getsxpaid for giving
the public what it’wants can be
anything even resembling fair,
then indeed the world is in dire
straits. .

But, you might argue, someone
has to do it. Someone has to be
there to watch the watchmen. If
not, how do we check their pow-
er? How do we inform the mass-
es without the services of the
press?

True, the media is an important

part of our political and social
processes. Without it, there
would almost certainly be a dead-
ly ignorance among the popu-
lation.

I just have a problem with
someone asserting that he might
have something other than a per-
sonal bias. Ifa journalist has a list
of facts —- cold, unemotional facts
_—— and uses only those facts to
report a story, there is still bias in-
volved. By the ommission of a
single piece of information he has
in his possession, the journalist
has exercised his judgment about
what might be important.

Usually, such a judgment is
based on some preconceived no-
tions about the effect the story is
to have, including how many
papers it might sell. The jour-

nalist, charged with presenting .

the news, and nothing but the ’

news, has merely given his im-
pression of what in the news is
worth hearing. .
Yet there are still claims of
detachment floating around in

v

linging rhetorical hash A

the classrooms and bars where
newspaper people collect.

This is not to say there is any-
thing we can do about such
things. Unless everyone has ac-
cess to all the newsthat happens
every day, we are going to have
to put up with the standards al-
ready established in the media.

it seems important to remem-
ber that the news we hear is only
one person's interpretation of an
event and interpretation seen
through whatever color glass the
writer, happens to be looking.

V The article I read ended with a

' statement that the journalist has
to be open always to a change in
opinion, that he should always
retain the ability to change his
mind. I wonder whether that in-
cludes the ability to realize that
any writer, of poems or of tech-
nical manuals, is giving nothing

* more universally applicable than

their interpretation of what has
happened.l

Much as it may run counter to
the things we like to believe, the
only words we can spread are our
own.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

The gentle art of healing

I wish to respond to Harold
Kyriazi’s letter concerning free
medical care to those in our so-
ciety who cannot afford it.

First of all, it is not a Marxist or"
Leninist idea. Around 430 B.C.,
Hippocrates wrote in his oath:

"... I urge you not to be too
unkind,‘ but to consider carefully
your patient’s superabundance or
means. Sometimes give your
services for nothing; and if there
be an opportunity of serving a
stranger who is in financial straits,
give him full assistance. For
where there is love of man, there
is also love of the art.”

I would hardly call Hippocrates
a socialist. Instead, he was one of
the fathers - of our future
profession.

I would also like to challenge
Kyriazi’s assertion that govern-
ment interference caused our
present medical problems in this

LETTERS

country. That is a rather outlan-
dish statement. Health care is not
perceived as any other market
commodity that is sold at a price
which the market can bear. It is
a service required by everyone in
our country, and how well we
can provide this service deter-
mines how well off our citizenry
is in comparison to the people in
other industrialized nations. Such
a service is a social responsibili-
ty which is essential to all, and
whose costs are shared by every-
one in our society.

Cities supported public hospi-
tals, religious institutions had
charity wards in their hospitals,
states supported nursing homes,

and non-profit hospitals ran fund- ,

' raising activities all in an attempt

to provide excellent health care
to all people regardless of their
ability to pay. The support went
further than that. Students in
medical school receive state and
federal assistance in‘ helping to
contain high tuition costs, though
they are still very high. [...]

We must not lose sight of the
purpose of medical care. It must
be made available to all segments
of our society, because it is essen-
tial to everyone. And there is no
reason doctors, hospitals or the
government should bear an un-
reasonable financial burden to
provide this goal. The main
problem we have to solve now is
how much money we, as a soci-
ety, are willing to pay for quality

medical care. That is our
challenge for the future.

Condoms on campus

Are condom vending machines necessary at Pitt?

By Rae Ann Collette

Staff Writer

AIDS is no longer just a ”gay”
disease or a drug users disease,
it is everyone’s disease.

At least 1.5 million people in
the U.S. today carry the AIDS vi-
rus. Each one of these people
puts his or her partner or partners,
as the case may be, at risk, and
many students fear contracting
the fatal disease.

The AIDS virus can be transmit-
ted between two people during
intimate sexual contact. Obvious-
Iy, the best method for eliminat-
ing the risk of contracting the
virus is to abstain from sexual ac-
tivity. However, those who are
sexually active and intend to re-
main so, must practice ”safe
sex.”

According to a pamphlet pub-
lished by U.S. News and World
Report, thecondom adequately
serves as a shield against the vi-
rus and other sexually transmitted
diseases. Condom use has been
proven to be almost 90 percent
effective. ' .

However, the report said many
sexually active students engage in

casual sex without using a
condom.

‘One speculation for lack of
condom use is the unavai_lability
of condoms to students. Many

. colleges are considering installing

condom vending machines on

campus.

”I have not heard that Pitt will
be installing any such condom
machines in the near future,”
Janet DeVoe, a nurse and health
educator at Pitt said. ”The best
way to get the University to take
action on such a project would
be for the students to request that
they want the condom vending
machines.

”I think that condom machines
on campus is a good idea. Stu-
dents should be encouraged to
use condoms if they are unsure

. whether their partners have a sex-

ually transmitted disease.”

L ”I don't see there being any
problem with condom machines
on campus," said Pitt Health
Service Pharmacist Joseph
Mance. ’’It would make condoms
more available to the students."

Mance said condom sales have
noticeably risen in the Student
Health pharmacy since the AIDS
crisis made news, especially
within the past 6-8 months.

”Students are becoming aware
of the disease and its transmission
and are doing something about
it,” Mance said.

Nevertheless, there is a differ-
ence of opinion as to whether
condom vending machines
should be installed on campus.

”Condom machines as well as
education about safer sex should
not influence people who do not

» have sex to do so," said DeVoe.

You read us every day. Even if we only come-out once a .
week, you keep reading that some issue, wondering how we
do it. Well, youcan do it too, with the proper instruction. Yes,
you can be a writer for this newspaper. All you have to do

is pick up the phone, and dial 648-7983, or 648-7984. Don't
be afraid. Go on. Pick up the phone.

”Abstinence is the best preven-
tion fortransmitting AIDS, but
that is not going to happen. For
those people who already have
sex and intend to continue, edu-
cation about the matter is
beneficial.”

Mance agreed. ”I don't think
that condom vending machines
would promote sex to those who
abstain,” he said.

‘ 

"Since condoms are
the only effective me-
ans of protection [from]
AIDS  the university
has the responsibility to
adequately supply
them to the students.”

—— Phil Moyer

Some Pitt students think the
vending machines would be a
good idea.

”I would think that condom
machines on campus would be
helpful. This would give students
their own choice,” said’ Chuck
Farinella, a mechanical engineer-
ing student.

”There’s enough press on the
subject of AIDS for students to
know about the risks.”

”I think that condom-vending
machines on campus is a good
idea— in restrooms,” said Pitt
student Michelle LaBrie.

Senior pharmacy major Laurie
Trilli agreed. ”.If students are go-
ing to engage in sex they may as
well protect themselves. Condom
vending machines would proba-
bly make condoms more readily
available to students,” she said."

However, some students don't
like the idea.

”When I think of condom
machines,” said Chris Phillips, a
business/economics major, ”I
think of a dirty, dingy bar.”

”I think it's best for students
who want condoms to but them
in the Student Health pharmacy
or one of the nearby drugstores,”
Phillips said. i

Whether students agree or dis-
agree about condom machine in-
stallation on campus, the AIDS
crisis remains.

SGB President Phil Moyer sup-
ports the idea of condom
machine installation on Pitt's
Oakland campus.

”Since condoms are the only
effective means of protection
[from] AIDS for those ,who are
sexually active, I think that the

university has the responsibility
to adequately supply them to the
students,” he said. ”Condom
vending machines would make
condoms accessible to the
students.” .

The University of Pittsburgh at
Bradford is waiting for a decision
from the administration on the in-
stallation of condom machines
on its campus. The Dean of Stu-

dent Affairs, Dr. James Evans, said '

there is no where on the Bradford
campus to purchase a condom
and that the nearest drugstore is
almost a mile and a half away.
’ ’’Although the final decision
has not yet been made, UPB is

leaning toward placing one_

machine in the Self Care Center
on campus within the next four
weeks," Evans said. ”Our
University feels that we must edu-
cate and supply protection to our
students who choose to be sexu-
ally active.”

”There’s been no talk yet of a"

’condom day’ at Pitt, butthe is-
sues concerning the subject are

of major concern to the student '

community,” Moyer said. ”I
think we need condom machines
on campus to protect against
AIDS."

Organization evaluates nuclear age  

By Maura Parks
For The Pitt News

There are instructors at the
University of Pittsburgh who not
only care about what happens at
Pitt, but who are concerned
about the world and its chances
of surviving the nuclear age. Tes-
timony to this is a relatively new
organization —- the Faculty for So—
cial Responsibility.

The one-and-a-half-year—old or-
ganization is fairly new to the Pitt
campus, and it is the only one of
its kind in the Pittsburgh area.

Social responsibility, according
to Steering Committee member
Dr. Marvin Bellin, doesn't stop
with just obeying the laws of our
society. He said concern should
lie with weapons that could pos-
sibly destroy life. The faculty or-
ganization is striving to heighten

awareness of peace and world
studies.

The group, formed during a
summit meeting a year and a half
ago, has a working staff of 25
people, and 200 registered
members.

For the last five months, the or-
ganization has been planning and
developing a course to be taught
in the Honors College for the
Winter '87-'88 term. The
class ”Rethinking Security in the
Nuclear Age,” will be offered as
a writing course. Collaborators in
this venture are Dr. John Town-
send, of the Physics department
and Dr. Eric Vierthaler, Adminis-
tration of Justice.

According to Dr. Robert Marin,
president of the Faculty for Social
Responsibility, the course was
designed ”to prompt both stu-

The organization will hold a
colloqium on Friday, May 15 at
4 p.m. in Forbes Quadrangle 5J.
50-54. The topic will be ”Peace
and World Order Studies at Pitt:
What Next?”

According to Marin, ”The col-
loquium will address the de-
velopment of coursework at the
university relatedto the universal
concerns of peace, social justice,
ecological balance and econom-
ic stability.”

The colloquium will give a
progress report on the Honors
College course. Special attention
will be given to the ways in
which faculty and students can
take part in peace and world ord-
er studies at Pitt and elsewhere. ,

The war at   home

Francis Corip

a distinctly
By Douglasiw. Payne

Gardens‘ of Stone opens with
its young, idealistic hero (por-
trayed by DB. Sweeney) being
buried at Arlington National

_ Cemetery, the garden to which

the film's title refers, and we
come to understand that this is
not the story of a war in
Vietnam.

Lest we forget, a battle raged
in America at this very point in
history. Conflicting media
reports and confusing issues led
to an unparalleled clash of so-

cial and political ideology.

Director Francis Ford Coppo-
la's decision to begin this film
with a funeral indicates the
heroes of Vietnam returned, not
to parades, but to taps.

To an even deeper extent,
Gardens Of Stone examines the
potency of relationships, partic-
ularly of father and son, as the
army's implicit duty and honor
force them into situations which
they might otherwise question.

The army thus becomes an ex-
tended family in the movie —- as
the mafia was in The Godfather
epics. Regardless, the army and

< the mafia provide ceaseless sup-

port for those willing to subscribe
to the ritualistic nature unique to

both.

James Caan and James Earl
Jones portray senior sergeants in
the Old Guard, a ceremonial
unit of the army in charge of
burying the casualties of war at
Arlington. The two sergeants are
not as much embittered by their
long commitment to the army as
they are puzzled by the army's

commitment to the Vietnam

War.

To these men, who essential-
ly hold military desk jobs, the
army is family.

Sweeney, who looks and acts
as if this whole film was a "be
all that you can be” television

commercial,‘ signs on to the Old - 4‘?

Guard, overly eager to be
shipped to the front line (be-
cause -that's where, any young
man who's willing belongs, so
he claims). _,

Theson of a Korean War
hero, he's more interested in be-
coming first a leader and then a
hero than in fighting for his
country.

. James Caan becomes sort of
a surrogate father to Sweeney
while he's at Fort lvleyer, cons-
tantly warning him that the Viet-
nam War was fought years
before the Americans became

involved and will continue until
they eventually kill each other
off. A

 

 cappora *

 

     

     

Dean Stockwell, portraying
the Old Guard's commanding
officer, rounds out the trio of
Sweeney's multiple father
figures "(including James Earl
Jones). Stockwell's performance
is, as always, solid and amiable,
but his main purpose in the film
seems to be comic relief. His role
consists simply of refusing to let
Caan's character transfer to Fort
Benning and of lending a certain
.dignifie.d_ authority to the
proceedings.

Gardens Of Stone is, in many
ways, a tone poem on remorse.

  

xh ‘
\

...;

Whereas Apocalypse Now
was a surrealistic journey into
how the ravages of war rat the
soul "of man, Coppola's newer
film concentrates on the war's
effect on relationships and how
we craft a world for which our
children must ultimatelyvbecome
victims.

Perhaps, it is no coincidence
that Coppola lost his 22-year-

old son, Gian Carlo, prior to the
_ filming of the rueful film.

Even Peggy Sue Got/\/larr/‘ed,
Coppola's most recent film, suc-
ceeded in its withdrawal from
looking remorsefully backwards
by celebrating the glorious
results of an innocent past. Kath-
leen Turner's Peggy cherished
her daughter most in frames of
golden hued joy as she attempt-
ed to consolidate her past with
lV\f/l'1Cll will become her present
I e.

Garden's Of Stone, despite a
cold white glow which bathes
each frame (suggesting the
blinding light reflected from me-
tal), is a regretful look toward
the past,*always self-consciously

. aware of the omni-present doom

in the atmosphere.
The film is, however, lazy and
sophomoric filmmaking. Coppo-

ola's new film, Gardens OfStone, gives a portrait of the Vietnam War from
merican point of view, but it lacks the impact of the award-winning P/atoon.

la has stated that the film is in no
way political or an anti-war
statement, but its philosophies
are not only hackneyed and
cliche-ridden, they are entirely
unconvincing.

James Caan's character does-
not believe in the Vietnam War,
but he wants to be transferred to
Fort Benning to train soldiers to

go into battle. Anielica Huston,-

who is shamefully wasted in a
soap-operatic subplot as Caan's
girlfriend, portrays a Washing-
ton Post journalist who firmly
protests the war but proudly
bows to stand by her army man,
despite his duty.

Overall, the entire cost over-
acts profusely as if this were The

Godfather ///. Yet it's exciting to g

watch these marvelous perform-
ers overachieve.

Garden's Of Stone is brilliant_

at maintaining its wholly Ameri-
can viewpoint on the war. Un-
like P/atoon or even Stanley

Kubrick's upcoming Fu// Meta/'

Jacket, Gardens Of Stone exa-
mines the casualties at home.
The film has its heart in the

right place, but its polite com-I

placency undermines its~ poetic
pretensions, and its fickle polit-

ics render it as mere melodrama.

DO you know why this man has a successful love life? lt's not because of his uncommonly good looks, his pronounced forehead or his sensual sneer. He's an entertainment writer.

Writing entertainment features gives one a confident demeanor that readily attracts the opposite sex (or the same sex, as the case may be).
Just imagine: You write a record review of a band you hold dear to your heart, and you wait by the‘ stack of freshly printed Pitt News copies as students casually stoop to pick up

You follow a student into Roy Rogers and slyly sit i_n the next booth, your eyes glued to the paper. She lances at the front page, flips through the news briefs and hesitates at the Perspective .
the bold section head — ENTER AINMENT. Your breath is shallow as the unsuspecting student glances through the

feature article and hesitates at Lola Fee. Then her eyes wonder to the top of the next page.

Team MVP Gregg Lamanti (left) prepares to hit one of his, heralded home runs while next year's co-captain David Westwood»(right) gets advised.

By Christopher Sepesy ’

Sports Editor

”... for you should just root,
root, root for the home team» and
_ if they don't win it's ashame ...”

The above quoted verse almost
could have been an anthem for.
the Pitt Panther baseball team this
year as they closed the season
yesterday with a winless three-
game series against the Villano-
va Wildcats. - ‘ _

The season record for the team
ends at 13 wins and 18 losses
overall, 5 and 13 in the Big East
Conference.

. The Panthers . played a two
game series this past weekend
against the Georgetown Hoyas

and won one game. But in order
for them to_ make the Big East
playoffs, they would have had to

l have won all three of the games
‘against Villanova. Again, this was

something they did not do. In
Monday's doubleheader, they fell
25-10 in the first game and 11-5

‘ in the second, and yesterday the

score ‘ was 10-5.

”After we played Georgetown .

this past weekend, we knew we
had a goal to go for, and that goal
was to get into the [Big East]
p|ayoffs,".said assistant baseball

1 ‘coach Larry Wayman. ”Unfor—

tunately, though,‘ we don't get to
see that goal fulfilled. .

Bruce signs accl

By Tarun Reddy
For The Pitt News

The Lady Panther’s basketball
team is coming off a disappoint-
ing season, winning just seven of
24 games; however, Coach Kirk

"Bruce has signed five new
recruits who should pay off im-
mediately in terms of winning.

Among the recruits are two
junior college teammates, one of
whom was an All-American. All
of them have speed and a knack

'- — for putting the ball in the hoop.

(Scoring was something the team
found a‘ diffucult task to accom-
plish last year.) .

’ Deidra Baker and Denise
Becher, both, played’ at Hilbert

’ per game.) In , Becher;_:iB‘ruce"ap-

Junior college in Hamburg, N.Y.,
and led the school to a two-year
record of 57 and 4. -

0 Baker, a 5-9 forward, was

named to the National Junior Col-
legiate Athletic Association All-
American team and was chosen
as the. Player of the Year in
Region III. She averaged 17
points and 7 rebounds per
contest.

Baker's ability to shoot from the
outside, as well as her propensi-
ty for scoring inside could make
her one of the premiere players
in the Big East.

.0 Becher, a 5-7 point guard,
averaged 17 points and 5 assists

gies were used up,” he con-
tinued. ”The players were a little
down, but they still played well
even though they were very tired.

”However, even though our
record may not show it, the sea-
son _hasn’t been a total loss. I'd
put our bats against anyone in the
country.” ‘ I .

And if you can just go through

the Panther batting roster, Way-

man’s statement d_oes have some
weight to it.

Senior player Chuckie Scales
alone was batting a .375 average
going into the series against the
Wildcats, and other power hitters
such as T.J. O'Leary and David
Westwood were not that far be-
hind. But the winning touch just

‘ didn't seem to be with the team.

aimed   recruits for team   

pears to have found a true point
guard who can hit the outside
shot and, more importantly, con-
trol the flow of the offense when
necessary.

Perhaps most importantly,
though, will be her ability to hit

.the three-point field goal, a shot

added for next season to the
women's game. If she can do it,
it could change the complexion
of many games.

0 Connie Hurt, a 6-4 center
from Penn Hills, will move up the
middle both offensively and
defensively.

’We’ll have someone in the
paint who's a. good scorer,” said

 

’’It's been an up and down
year," said head baseball coach

' Bobby Lewis. ”We had good

days and bad days. Overall, we

' hit well, but we didn't have the

luck to really pull out the big
wins. . _ .
”One of the funniest things has
been the way things went against
each other this season,” he con-
tinued. ’’I believe we set a record
this year with the home runs we
hit. Think of it, 60 home runs in
31 games. And from 13 different
people. That, I think, is pretty

‘remarkable. But we just couldn't

seem to gut out the wins.”
One thing both Lewis and

Wayman are happy about is that

they are only losing two starters

‘this year. Much like the Panther

At the same time, Hurt’s« height
should make the lab pass a key
facet of the Panther’s offensive
scheme. Hurt accounted for 18
points and 10 rebounds per game
as a senior.

0 Whitney Mack, a 5-9 forward
from Springfield, Ohio, has blind-
ing speed, according to Bruce.
Her athletic ability impressed the
coaching staff so much that she
was signed during the early sign-
ing period.

Bruce characterizes her as a
budding star who could surprise
a lot of people. ”We need some-
one who has the jumping ability
in combinationwith speed, and
Whitney appears to be that play-

V er,’,' said_Bruc'e.  .   

 

 

 Baseball coaches reflect on ended season

basketball team, most of the play- ""

ers returning will be seasoned
veterans. And they are already
planning for next season.
”During the off-season, we
plan to bolster our pitching,” said
Lewis. ”The Big East is a very
tough conference, especially with

teams like Seton Hall and Vil7-

lanova. But we've got a lot of
young guys coming back, and
with the power hitting we've had
this year, matched with the pitch-
ing arms we intend to have, we
shouldn't have to see a repeat of

this seasonand really come out  .

Panther runners do well attwo events

By Calvin Holmes
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's track team com-
peted in the Big East Track Cham-
pionships recently at Villanova
University and placed second to
the Redmen of St. John's Univer-
sity and by two points.

This past weekend, the Pan-
thers hosted the 1987 Pitt Invita-
tional in which the Panthers, who
have had a more than impressive
running season this year, placed
highly in many events. The Pan-
thers entered the Big East meet
with hopes of repeating their in-
door track championship of
March.

But, these hopes were soon
shattered as the Redmen of St.
John's accumulated 70 points on
the first day of competition, while

the Panthers only managed to
gain five. -

On the second and final day of
competition, the Panthers were
ready to dominate the running
events. They came back strong,
but not strong enough to overtake
St. John's, who won 99 to 97.

But all was not lost.

While the Panthers were busy
making up the 65 point deficit of
the day before, three runners
managed to finish well enough to
become Big East Champions in
four individual events.

All—Big East Pitt sophomore Tim
Kulig won the javelin competi-
tion, while his teammate, junior
Calvin Holmes, won the

ll0—meter high hurdles.

Pitt's All-World, All—American
and All—Big East sprinter Lee
McRae took top honors in the

100- and 200—meter dashes.

One highlight for the Panthers
at the Big East Championship
meet was their sweep of the top
four places in the 100-meter high
hurdles.

The Panthers were led by Hal-
mes, followed by George lfill,
Eric Cannon and Jason Harris

Teams like Villanova and Ge-
orgetown didn’t perform as well
as they had in past Big East cham-
pionships. Their overall team per-
formances left the door wide
open for St. John's to sneak in and
capture the Big East Champi-
onship. ‘

But the invitational provided
Pitt with an opportunity to
squelch the blues and perform as
they have for the better part of the
season.

been for most of this year, com-
ing in first in their respective
events.

The men's team, made up of
Price, Moore, Mighty and Manes,
ran the drill in 3:09:13, while the
women's team, composed of
Bonner, Kathy Azeke, Randolph
and Roberts,,ran it in 3:5l:6.

The men also had various other
first—place finishers. In the H0
high hurdles, Cannon once again
pulled a victory. He was followed
by lfill in second and Harris in

third.

lfill was also the first finisher in
the invitational field competition
race in this event. Harris was first
in the 400-meter high hurdles.

In the 800—meter race, Manes
and Moore finished third and
fourth, respectively. Also finish-
ing third and fourth, but this time
in the 400-meter run were Price
and Mighty.

Pitt's other male finisher was in

Panther Paul Friedrich finished.

third with a time of 9:l2:9.
