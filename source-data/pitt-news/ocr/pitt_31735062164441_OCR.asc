SG Bill Revamps
LA Cabinet Status

By JACK! KATZ
Student Government passed a bill at Thursday night's
meeting revamping the Liberal Arts Cabinet as an arm of

Tom Olofson, president in 1962-63. The new bill is a restate-
ment of the original bill with additions and changes.

The bill, introduced by senators Jerry Hogan and Mar-
cia Bernstein, calls for a Cabinet composed of seven full-time
undergraduate students. Six of these are to be selected at

large from among the students
of the School of Liberal Arts. The
seventh member will be an SG
senator from the School of Lib-
eral Arts.

Other major points of the bill
state that a student must have
completed 30 credits at the time
of application for a cabinet posi-

tionandthatthestudentmnst‘

have at least a 2.50 ovenall Qual-
ity Point Average (QPA) or a
3.0 QPA for the previous two
trimesters. /
Interested students must ﬁle
an application with the SG presi-
dent. Cabinet members will be
selected on the basis of an inter-

view.

We get pretty concerned
about the way life insurance
is often sold.

We're not in favor of a
client just buying a policy
and getting it over with. We
want him to understand
what it's all about, how his
policy can be made to serve
a variety ofgfuture needs,
how it will fit into an overall
financial program tailored
to his own requirements.

It's this approach that
separates the professional
from the ordinary salesman.
And if you feel you'd be _
more satisfied dealing with
a professional, we're at
your service.

Marcie McNutt sat at the
table in Tower C.,_ carefully
preparing a grave for a piece
of soggy lettuce. Her long
blond hair feH forward, and
her alert eyes looked through
her dark—rimmed glasses.
“You have to play games
sometimes” she said. “It’s
part of reality.”

In her two and one-half years
of college Marcie has become
more aware of reality. “I was
idealistic when I came here, but
I think I have grown up,” she
recounts. She came looking for
something new, something chal-
lenging. But for her, the novel-
ty soon wore on."

“I had always been impatient
with the slowness of social
change.” In the Hill Education
Project she saw a fast, effective
way for change. “That's why I
like being part of it—-it’s some-
thing meaningful.”

Marcie is co-chairman of HEP.
Through her experience on the
project, she feels “better able
to understand the responsibilities
an individual should have.” Be-
cause ‘of her desire to know
people better she became inter-
ested in the Brother-Sister Pro-
Eram, which helps foreign stu-
dents adpust to American Life.

“My relationship with these '

people have broadened my edu-
cation more than any class ever
could.”

“The purpose of the educa-
tional experience is to help a per-
son find value and meaning in
life,” Marcie reiterates.

The whole educational experi-
ence depends completely on what
the student makes of it, and “peo-
ple are the most important thing.”

Many students say grades are.

not important and they won't
study, Marcie points out. “But
that's the wrong idea. You have
to work with the system and do
the best you can, while still
maintaining your own ideas.”‘

“Honesty is the most important
thing. You have to be honest to
yourself and to others. Some-
times it works and sometimes it
dosen’t.”

Marcie, a junior majoring in
English literature and minoring
in sociology, wants to teach. But
she’s not really sure what will
happen. As she says “I don’t
know what I’ll do or where I'll
go—but I'm not afraid.”

Editorial: Silent Soap Box

It is distressing to think that even after a year when student involvement reach-
ed a peak that candidates for the top Student Government posts should be so hard to
scrounge up. This is not to say that both presidential candidates have not presented
well-conceived platforms. Nor is it to say that Harvey Lefton in particular comes to

the campaign with a noteworthy record of school service and leadership.

It is simply surprising that the ferment felt in the student body this year has not
expressed itself in any more strong, outspoken presidential candidates, that the new Pitt
Progressive Party which demands that the Able__ Party has not fulfilled its promises
could not ﬁnd executive candidates, that Eric’ Stern does not have a running mate and
did not garner a senatorial force behind him.

Where the fault lies is difficult to pinpoint. Whether the eligibility requirements
are too stringent where grades or terms spent at the University may have eliminated in-
terested candidates, whether the junior class is simply low in outstanding leadership,
whether people are afraid to run, or whether the interest is not quite high as we gauge
it to be, there have been no soap boxes, no debates, no noteable clashes of viewpoints.

There was -a spectacular personality battle two years ago with the Pete Bijur -
Marty Landy campaign. Last year John Vrana ran unopposed. This year, we had hoped
with an upward trend of general student awareness, with interest groups -arising from
within the student body such as that supporting women's curfew changes, there might
be an actual competition and debateable philosophies.

But unfortunately Eric Stern has not been able to stir up a political conﬂict here:
his leadership background on campus is insigniﬁcant compared to Lefton’s more obvious
qualifications and he has not made a strong effort to strike up major support. _

Because experience in a leadership position where there has been substantial
interaction with student,‘ faculty, and administrative leadership is a strong prerequisite
for -a successful Student Government president, we must endorse Harvey Lefton on the
basis of his past record. Unfortunately this campaign has seemed lackadaisical and the
two-party competition one in name only.

  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

|

Cheerleader

Answers Back
Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter not
only in reply to the letter print-
ed in the Feb. 10 Pitt News but
also to clear up a number of mis-
understandings that the student
body’ has regarding the cheer-
leaders,

For the most part, I, and the
rest of the squad,‘ must agree
with what Miss Ellenbogen has
said in her letter, but she used
a phrase which disquited me as
it is representative of a rather
widespread feeling.

She said, “You representing all
of us have given up nothing.”
The cheerleaders are there to
lead cheers -— not to do them
alone for the entertainment of
the student body, or that very
small part of it that comes to the
basketball games. We have been
ogled, stared at, laughed at and
booed’ at, but never have we got-
ten a response. So many of us
have been very disappointed or
lost heart.

Now, one might respond to this
in two ways: one could say we're
then ‘deserting the team — that
they need the support. And this
is true but if the students will
not cheer with us, we can sit in
the stands and cheer alone and
give the team the same amount
of support.

' One might also say that it’s our
fault that the students don't
cheer with us. This could be true,

Courses Absent
During Spring

Editor, The Pitt.News:
‘ Is the spring trimester really

   

   
 

.\

ter‘? I -tend to doubt that; -

   
 

it is after looking at the limited

' curriculum offered. We can all

appreciate the problems of the
University. However, as long as
it is offering a trimester program,
it should offer a program that
contains three equal trimesters.

This problem came to my at-
tention after attempting to regis-
ter for a course three consecu-
tive trimesters and ﬁnding it
closed the ﬁrst day of registra-
tion. I again checked into the
course for the spring and now
ﬁnd it not being offered at all.
If the course has been so popular
previously, what has caused its
disappearance?

Upon checking a few other
courses I found a surprising fact.
During the fall trimester a total
of 51 different courses were of-

fared in English and Fine Arts

(combined total). The spring tri-
mester only offers a total of 28.
A difference occurs in many
other departments also, ,

Is it possible that the faculty
is so limited that replacements
cannot be found for those instruc-
tors taking leave, or is Pitt's ﬁ-
nancial status so low that it can
not accommodate a full program?‘
We all realize that the student
body is greatly reduced during
the summer. To solve this prob-
lem the number of classes offer-
ed in the same course could be
reduced, Or an early poll could
be taken to determine the num-
ber of students desiring speciﬁc,
courses.

If Pitt cannot solve a ﬁnancial
problem (without another tuition
raise) or supply the needed in-
structors (without sacriﬁcing
quality), then the trimester sys-
tem should be abandoned.

Solution Offered
For Cheating

Editor, The Pitt News:

Life Magazine claims that al-
most one-half of all college stu-
dents do it. More than 100 Air
Force cadets were expelled be-
cause of it. An examination here
at the -University-zrof 

was declared invalid because of
it, What is it that has drawn so
much attention’ and has caused
so much trouble? Why, cheating,
of course.

Something should be done about
cheating here at Pitt; not by the
.administration, but by the stu-
dents themselves. After much
thought and consideration, I have
‘come to the conclusion that some-
thing can be done about cheat-
ing. Here. Now.

I, therefore, propose that a
judiciary committee be establish-
ed as an appendage of Student
Government. All persons accused
of cheating here at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh shall be brought
before this committee. This com-
mittee on cheating should be
empowered to mete out penalties
up to and including suspension
to persons found guilty of cheat-
ing. This committee should also
be able to recommend expulsion
in the most serious cases of mis-
conduct.

It is of the utmost importance
that this committee be establish-
ed and maintained by the stu-
dent body alone. In order to en-
gender the most widespread stu-
dent support possible, the admin-
istration must not be allowed to
have an inﬂuence over the com-
mittee whatsoever. The students
would support an all-student

committee much more readily ‘

than they would an administra-
tion controlled committee.

The members of this committee
on cheating should be appointed
by student Government with cer-
tain minimum qualiﬁcations be
ing established for those wishing
to serve.

This plan is both practical and
possible. This plan, or plans of a
similar nature, are now in op-
eration at Princeton, John Hop-
kins, and the University of Vir-
ginia, It works at these other
universities, it can also work at
Pitt.

C True Confession

The Quick Answer

By Al Janezic

There is a great commotion i .
Office of Student Misdemeanors. Plecitzillz :.Il‘1:e1;):cI§1g?fb:lg1:
and forth, some chattering excitedly. Amidst it all in the
center of the room, sits a bedraggled student with’a spot-
light glaring in his face. A man is standing over him.

“Okay. Let’s try it again. What’s
your name?”
“Paul,” the -boy answered.
“Paul what ?"
“Kerzmootsev, sir.”
“What’s your class rank?”
. __ _ ",‘Sophomore, second trimester,

 “Paul Kerzmootsev, sophomore,
“ second trimester, huh?” What’s your
student number Kerzmootsev?
“301-622-015-F, sir.”
“301-622-015-E. Hmmm. Seems to ’
me I've heard that number before.”

AN AIDE BENDS over and says: “He was picked up
last tmonth, S11‘, for colaborating on a homework assign-
men .”.

. “Ah, yes. I remember. But this time it’s more serious,
isn't it Paul?”

Paul gulps. “Yes sir.”

“Is it not true, Paul, that on the morning of Feb. 15 A
you were caught glancing at the bluebook of Miss Natalie
Smith in Economics 86? Answer. Isn’t it?”

“For the 906th time, sir, I only wanted to see if she was
writing on every other line.”

“Come, come, Kerzmootsev. We've been through this
now for the last 15 hours. All you have to do is plead guilty,
sign this paper, and . . . and itsall over, so to speak.”

Kerzmootsev sighs and slumps deeper in his chair.

‘ .“And if I sign, sir, it’s all over?”

“Yes, yes, son. All over.”

“OKAY, SIR. If it’ll be all over. But I really didn’t-___”
“Just sign, Kerzmootsev. Right here.”

“May I read it ﬁrst, sir?”

“Read it! Good Heavens, Kerzmootsev., We've wasted

enough time. Sign. Sign!” ..,

Paul signs his name. “There, sir. Is it all over now?”

“Yes, Kerzmootsev. It’l1__soon be all over. Take him to
the Quadrangle, men.” - .

“To the Quadrangle, sir?” protests Paul. “But I thought
you said it was all over?”

“Yes, it is, Kerzmootsev. Now you must face the pun-

ishent. It was in the statemen .”

“Punishment? But you said nothing about punishment, , g
sir. I didn’t get to read the statement.” \
“Well, yes, son. But you were stubborn, you know, and
we had to----”
“But that’s dis-honest, sir. That’s-.--that’s cheating.”
Another aide comes forward. “All the rocks are ready,

“Good. Will we have enough for all the Economics 86
class?” - <r
“Yes, sir. But that’s all. There’ll be none left for you
to throw, sir.”

“That’s quite all right. I’ll just use my paper weight.
C’mon, let’s go.”

“COME, COME, Kerzmootsev. Just run along with the
men. I'll be right out.”

The door closes after Kerzmootsev and three guards. ‘

An aide comes forward. “Isn’t the punishment 9. bit a '
harsh, sir?” .

“Harsh? No. This is our test case. We have to show
everyone we mean business. This’ll put a stop to cheating
once and for all.”

(By the author of “Rally Round the Flag, Bog/s."’,

“Dobie Gillis,” etc.)

THE BEARD OF AVON

'T_opic for today is that pere11nial favorite of English majors,

that ever-popular crowd pleaser, that good sport and great

’ American—Willian1 Shakespeare (or “The Swedish Nightin-
gale” as he is better known as).

First let us examine the persistent theory that Shakespeare (or
“The Pearl of the Pacific” as he is jocularly called) is not the
real aut-hor of his plays. Advocates of this theory insist the plays
are so full of classical‘ allusions and learned references that they
couldn’t possibly have been written by the son of an illiterate
country butcher.

To which I reply “F augh!” Was not the great Spinoza’s father
a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac Newton’s
father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton, incidental-
ly, is one of history’s truly pathetic ﬁgures. He was, by all ac-
counts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but baseball,
alas, had not yet been invented. It used to break young Isaac’s
heart to see his father get up every morning, put on uniform,
spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind second base,
bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting, waiting. That’s
all—waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers and yelled “Good
show, Dad!” and stuff like that, but everyone else in town snig-
gered derisively, made coarse gestures, and pelted the Newtons
with overripe fruit——figs for the elder Newton, apples for the
younger. Thus, as we all know, the famous moment came when
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his feet,
shouted “Europa!” and announced the third law of motion: “For
every action there is an opposite and equal react-ion!”

    

Figs for the elder‘ Newton, applesfor the yovzmgerzf

(How profoundly true these simple words are! Take, for ex-
ample, Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades. Shave with a
Personna_. That’s the action. Now what is the reaction? Pleasure,
delight, contentment, cheer, and facial felicity. Why such a
happy reaction? Because you have started with the sharpest,
most durable blade ever honed—a blade that gives you more
shaves, closer shaves, comfortabler shaves than any other brand

'on the market. If, by chance, you don’t agree, simply return
your unused Personnas to the manufacturer and he will send you
absolutely free a package of Beep-Beep or any other blade you

‘think is better.)

But I digress. Back to Shakespeare (or “The Gem of the
Ocean” as he was ribaldly appelated).

Shakespeare’s most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or,
as it is frequently called, Macbeth). This play tells in living color
the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a
ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have
a ﬁrst folio that is frankly not too legible.) Anyhow, Hamlet is so
upset by seeing this ghost (or goat) that he stabs Polonius and
Brer Bodkin. He is thereupon banished to a leather factory by
the king, who hollers, “Get thee to a tannery!” Thereupon
Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes shouts, “Get thee to a"
beanery!” Ophelia is so cross that she chases her little dog out of
the room, crying, “Out, damned Spot!” She is ﬁned ﬁfty shillings

for cussing, but Portia, in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence com-
muted to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen.
Mab proclaim a fest-ival—complete with kissing games and a
pie-eating contest. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time until
Banquo’s ghost (or goat) shows up. This so unhinges Richard III '
that he drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a lively
discussion, during which everyone is killed. The little dog -Spot
returns to utter the immortal curtain lines:

Om‘ hero now has crooked,
And so’s our prima domza.
But be of cheer, my friends.
You’ll always have Personna.

Lehigh Smashes Matmen

By BILL CABIN

BETHLEHEM, PA. — Lehigh’s light-
’ weights led the Engineers to their ninth
‘ win Saturday, defeating the wrestling team
123-6. Forty-four hundred partisan Lehigh
;fans saw seven Panther wrestlers defeated,

-‘as the matmen incurred their fifth loss.
 The lightweight trio of Mike Caruso,
,-Joe Peritore, and Bill Stuart won their
opening matches, and the men were floored

,; for the rest of the meet.

Caruso came out strutting like an expert show-
-man, and took down Tom Heniff in the ﬁrst per-
.5 iod. Although Heniﬁ countered with a take down
in the second period, Caruso reversed him and
, scored a riding time point, winning the'l23-pound
match, 5-2. .

‘_ The Peritore-Mike Johnson match has been
billed as the evening's top event, but the injury-
ridden Johnson did not make the trip. Instead,

the 130-pound sophomore ran his winning streak
‘_ to 10-0, defeating Tom Liberati.

_i Liberati scrambled all over the mat, but could
not gain control as Peritore scored a 6-1 victory.

- Peritore now ranks as the top 130-pounder in the
.East and will seek J ohnson’s Eastern title at the
EIWA tournament on March 12-13.

Johnson began the year late because of a knee
. operation and had the ﬂu. Although coach Rex

Peery wanted to take him, he was not in good
enough condition.

Peery moved Frank O’Korn to the 137-pound
division in an effort to beat the undefeated Stuart.
Although O’Kom overpowered him several times,

I Stuart gained two take downs, winning the match,

 - 5-2.

O’Korn now has a 7-2 record, having won all
seven matches in the 147-weight class. He will

- probably "remain at 137 for the Penn State meet
 and the Easterns. At last year’s tournament, he
 -- placed fourth as a 137-pounder.

Dino Boni switched to the 147-pound division

to replace O’Korn, but lost his second consecutive
' match to Engineer sophomore Glen Amsbaugh.

Boni had control during most of the match and

jf had a near fall in the second period. Amsbaugh,
 however, evaded a pin, scored a reversal and had
_ I a predicament in the ﬁnal period, defeating Boni,
0' v 9-5.

BILL STUART won his 137-pound match at Le-
high by defeating Frank O’Korn,, 5-2. Lehigh won
the match, 23-6. The Engineers are now 9-0. The

Panthers stand 4-5. ‘

Boni placed third at 147 in last y_ear!s Easterns,
and Peery was disappointed with his match with
Amsbaugh. .“He should be Eastern champ this
year,” said Perry. Boni now has a 5-2-1 record.

Tom Baily and Lee Hall were the only wrest-
lers to defeat Engineers. Baily entered the 157-
pound match against sophomore Bob Hartenstine
with the matmen trailing, 12-0. ,

Baily, however, scored a take down in the ﬁrst
period and then had complete control. Although
Hartenstine twisted and turned, he could not re-
verse or escape. Baily had a 5:15 riding time ad-
vantage going into the third period, winning the
match, 3-0.

Hall remained the team’s only undefeated
wrestler by winning a 10-2 decision against Toni
Narducci. The match was even in the ﬁrst period,
but Narducci got control and seemed to have the
advantage. Hall, however, reversed him and scored
.a take down and near fall in the ﬁnal period.

Lehigh also won the 167, 191, and heavyweight
matches, respectively. Harley Ferguson beat Clair
Riley, 6-1; Ron Bushner beat Al Traunsteiner, 5-0;‘
and John Illengwarth pinned Bill Bodle in 38
seconds. 'I‘raunsteiner gave a good performance in
the 191-pound match, despite a 30-pound weight
advantage by Bushner. "

Second Half Proves Costly
As Panthers Lose 14th Tilt

By FRANKSMIZIK

The basketball team ‘had the game against George
Washington won in the ﬁrst half, but forgot how to shoot
in the second half and lost, 92-79, at Washington, D. C., Sat-
urday night. After a hot ﬁrst half the Panthers blew a seven
point lead with the poorest shooting half of the season.

The Panthers shot 60 per cent in the ﬁrst half while

hitting only for 19 per cent in the second half. Coach Bob
Timmons said, “It was the best 20 minutes of basketball we have
played all year, While the second half was one of the worst)?

Only ﬁve ﬁeld. goals were tallied by the Panthers in the last 20
minutes. “We got plenty of shots
(27), but we just couldn’t hit.”

Defensively, the Panthers had
problems in the second half be-
cause of foul troubles. Larry
Szykowny, Brian Fisher and
Daryle Ruby had three fouls on
them in the ﬁrst 20 minutes.

“We had to change our defense
in the second half because of
the foul situation,” said Tim-
mons. “We had been playing very
well with a tight man-to-man de-
fense, but had to switch to a
zone, and that hurt us.”

In. the second half George
Washington shot 59 per cent
against the Panthers’ zone. “We
hustle more when we play a man-
to-man type defense, we just
aren’t as aggressive in the zone,”
said Timmons.

In the rebounding statistics the Panthers weren’t completely out
of the running. George Washington only out rebounded them 41-35.
“We don’t seem to box out as well in the zone defense as we do in
the man-to-man and this is sometimes the reason we get out-rebound-
ed, although hustle is still the most important thing,” said Timmons.

The 13 point difference in the ﬁnal score doesn’t indicate the
closeness of the game. A ﬁeld goal by Joe Lalli with 7:27 left in‘the
game put George Washington in the lead and capped a surge that
showed the Colonials come from 13 points behind. «

 

Scores 16 points.

The last time that the Colonials had been in the lead was early
in the ﬁrst half when they had held the lead at 19-18. At that time
the Panthers scored 14 points to George Washington's two points and
they took a commanding lead. 1

“Bob Lovett is again playing good ball for us,” said Timmons.
“He did a good Job under the boards by grabbing ten rebounds and
he was also high scorer for us with 23 points.”

Timmons also praised his guards. “We are still getting excellent
performances from our guards, Szykowny had 17 points and Fisher
had 16 points. Daryle Ruby had a good ﬁrst half but his foul prob-
lems hampered him in the second half.” Ruby still ﬁnished with 13
points. A

High scorer for the Colonials was Mark Clark who tallied 26

Fresh Th gee .8 Second
Costly in Loss to St. Vincent

A three-second violation against
the freshman basketball team
proved costly in the 71-67 loss to
St- Vincent College last Wednes-
day night.

The Cubs were down by one
point with a minute left in the
game and they had possession.
But as the ball was being work-
ed around for the good shot, the

referee spotted a Cub lingering .

in the three-second lane and the
ball and the game went over to
St. Vincents. A

 Welcome Change to PM 

By BARRY SHAW _ _
The PM Series changed its format Thursday night In
the Student Union Lower Lounge as it presented folk-
‘singers Joe and Penny Aaronson. The consensus of the audi-
ence seemed to reflect the actual quality of the concert-

 

that it had its good and bad points.

, The Aaronsons took folk songs from every corner of
i the world and rendered them sometimes amusmgly, some-

times soulfully and sometimes tastelessly. In singing a

f song from a German concentra-
 tion camp, the Aaronsons creat-
 ed a powerful dramatic effect.
‘H _ In singing several bawdy sonzs

from Scotland. England and Amer-

ica, the Aaronsons were quite

‘~ ‘,1 g gmnsing in a very adult manner.
 - However. in imitatins‘ an A1130
I S Sherman take-of! on Frere Jac-
ques, they bordered on tasteless-
ness. Several of their sonzs had

 3 a very certain ethnic appeal
;";,_ , which might have been more air

‘..p1-opriate at a Bar Mitzvah.

. Most of the songs, nevertheless,

were of a fairly high quality as
was evidenced by “Everybody
Loves Saturday Night.” In this
number, the Aaronsons took the
very simple lyric and sung it in
the languages of about six dif-
ferent countries.

Audience participation enhanced

every number in which it was.

used. Eight members of the audi-
ence displayed posters of fam-
ous personalities sung about.
Folksinging added a welcome
change to the PM Series-

BY ROSS DANIELSON

T he highly entertaining
comedy being presented by
the University Theater, this
week, Playboy of the West-
ern World, is Well chosen:
it foreshadows much of the
great theater of the 20th
century and introduces Irish
theatrical genius to the world
stage. Through a poetic and
truthful realism drawn from the
spirited and simple Irish country
folk, Synge satirizes the uncon-
scious villainy of the people.

The necessarily fragile line be-
tween realism, and slapstick and
farce was skillfully followed in
last Thursday’s performance by

the leading and secondary actorszf

Dan Frezza (the playboy), Har-
riet Allen, Jeff Ember, Barbara
Lyon, Mike Kaplan, and Charles
Bemey. The fragility of this line
was best suggested by Barbara
Lyon’s performance as widow

Playboy of the Western World

Quinn, which failed to balance a
ﬂipant, sarcastic humor with ser-
iousness and genuine female in-
tensity.

The two leading actors, Dan
Frezza and Harriet Allen (as
young Pegeen Mike) both sus-
tain very fine performances.
More change might he wished
for in the playboy however; and
Harriet Allen could be more
frankly jealous (as Synge prob-
ably intended) rather th a n
haughty and tight-lipped.

Frezza and Miss Allen's show,
is “stolen" in the last act how-
ever, by the humorous and real-
istic performance of Charles Ber-
ney as Old Mahon, the pl.ayboy’s
father.

Most other obvious faults are
probably “first night-trimester
system phenomena”, such as
clumsy “stimulus and response”
coordination in arguments and
scufﬂes.

   

If there are any important

weaknesses in the production,
they are miraculously made in-
visible by the excellent set de-
signed by Philip ll. Eek. The
set is imaginitively constructed
to support not only the action
of the play but also its ideas.

One last criticism must be di-
rected at the students and other
members of the University com-
munity; the play was poorly at-
tended. Don’t miss this play. It
will be running February 22 to
27 at 8:30 p.m. in Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial, which is, inci-
dentally, one of the finest thea-
ters in -the world; there are no
bad seats.
