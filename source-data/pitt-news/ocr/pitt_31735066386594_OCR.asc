PLRB rules faculty can vote on unionization

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Full-time Pitt faculty and librarians can
to unionize, the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board ruled
last week.

“The labor board’s decision was very
important for us here at Pitt. It enables us
now to go forward and resolve the question
of unionization, to debate the issues and
to find out what the will of the faculty is,”
United Faculty President Phil Wion said.

The board’s ruling reverses a 1987
decision by the hearing examiner that said
full—time faculty were managers and,
therefore, not eligible to unionize under
state law. The board rejected the idea of
faculty as managers on Monday, ruling

FAS Council urged
to fight budget cuts

that since only 10 percent of the faculty
take roles in inﬂuencing the administration
through the university senate, the entire
faculty could not be considered managers.

A statement released by the university
after Monday's ruling reaffirms the
administration’s long—standing assertion
that the faculty are managers.

“The university continues to maintain
that governance of a university is shared
among professionals and should not
require adversarial negotiations and
collective bargaining between
representatives of management and labor,”
the statement said.

Part-time faculty, whose right to unionize
was not challenged in 1987 by the hearing
examiner, held an election and voted in
favor of unionization (329-289) in 1987.

The United Faculty offered to begin
negotiating then, but because of the
appeals of the ruling on full-tirne faculty,
the administration declined to begin
negotiations on the part-time issues, Wion
said. The 1987 part-time election is now
void, as those faculty will now vote along
with the full-time faculty.

Wion said that sometime within the next
few weeks there will be a pre-election
conference where representatives from
the PLRB, the United Faculty and the
administration will gather to discuss some
details of the situation and set a date for an
election. Wion said that he thinks the
election will be held in late March or early
April.

“The board would set the date for the
election, and there would be considerable

discussion and debate to air the issues and
to hear all of the pros and cons,’ W/ion
said.

There is a legal means by which the
administration could seek to block the
election by asking the commonwealth
court to hear an appeal on the issue of
whether faculty are mangers or not, Wion
said.

‘It remains to be seen whether the
administration will take that option. If it
does, it could delay the election somewhat,
depending on how quickly the court
would act,” Wion said. “I certainly hope
and the United Faculty hopes that the
administration will not try to further delay
this election.”

budget cuts for Fiscal Year ’92,
according to FAS Dean Peter

Koehler.

FAS is very productive in terms
of teaching and generating funds,
and should be shielded from some
of the budget cuts, Koehler told a
meeting of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council on Tuesday.

‘I think that we all know that
we more than pay our way and
that there are other units that do
not pay their way and that, in
effect, FAS has been for many
years in fact subsidizing those
units. I think what we should do
about it now is to confront the
administration,” political science
Professor Irwin Schulrnan said.

On Nov. 5, Pitt President Wesley
Posvar released a draft budget for
FY ’92 that included a ‘top
priority” 7.5—percent increase in
the salary pool and predicted a
$14.5 million shortfall. Provost
Donald Henderson has said that
one of the remedies he is
‘seriously considering’ is an
across-the-board cut for all units
of 6.2 percent, which would be

enough to cover the shortfall and
have 1 percent left to reimburse
top priority units.

“I believe that an across-the-
board cut for this type of unit as
opposed to all of the other units
is not a very sensible proposal.
And what we need to do is to
convince the powers that be of
that. Objections were made that
that proposal was blind to priority,
blind to the need of the university
in terms of producing revenue
and blind to the quality of the
program,” Koehler said.

“If you were to cut 6.2 percent
out of the FAS budget, that
represents $3.6 million.”

Koehler held the meeting the
day before a provost’s retreat on
the budget to find out about
faculty concerns.

Koehler showed the meeting a
variety of charts and graphs that
he said illustrate that FAS is
productive in terms of teaching.
One showed that FAS generates

Pitt wins Blood Drive by 500 units

Last week when over 100 members
of the Black Action Society attended
the open student hearing for the pres-
idential-search oomrnittee they ‘strongly
suggested’ that three students appointed
by the BAS be added to the committee.

‘We urge the search committee and
whomever else is responsible for making
the necessary changes to contact us by
Nov. 21, 1990, 12 noon, because ifthe
issue is not dealt with by this time, the
chances of solving this problem ordedy

BAS political—action committee Chair-

personjustin Laing said at the meeting.
Yesterday Iaing said that the BAS
had not yet been contacted either by

‘We had hoped that they would get
back to us but we didn't really expect
them to,’ Laing said

--— Jennifer Calabrese

Pitt won this year’s Pitt-Penn State Blood
Drive by about 500 units of blood, according
to Jeff Rosenthal, co—chairperson of the
eighth annual blood drive.

‘It was great,’ Rosenthal said.
‘Considering that Penn State has about
20,000 more students than Pitt, I think this
is a real accomplishment.’

Pitt lost last year’s blood drive by only 20
units, Rosenthal said

“The reason we lost was because there
were about 150 lined up to give blood at
Pitt-Johnstown, and there was a water

problem, so only 20 of them could give,’

Rosenthal explained.

Rosenthal co-chaired the drive with
Colleen Higgins. Rosenthal said that he
attributes this year's success to a new
approach he and Higgins took.

“’Ihis year we went to fraternity and
sorority houses and talked to them about
why giving blood was not only good for
Greek Week but also because you help
people,” Rosenthal said.

The blood drive results were announced
during halftime at Saturday’s Pitt-Penn
State football game.

As part of a week-long series
titled ‘Mister Rogers Talks About
Mouths and Feelings,’ faculty
from the University of Pittsburgh
School of Dental Medicine visited
the neighborhood to lessen
children’s anxieties about going
to the dentist.

“We're hoping to model
behavior, to show that Mr. Rogers
can go to the dentist, and it is a
pleasant experience and can be
pleasant for [children] as well,’
said Dennis Ranalli, D.D.S.,

,, 70s—style clothes back in fashion

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

‘tr Donna Berardi from Avalon Vintage Clothing models a 70s outﬁt.

By William Graves
sum’ Writer

Shirts with “lobster bib’ collars
and rainbow colors, bell-bottom
jeans and platform shoes are all
styles of what a popular fashion
magazine called “the decade that
taste forgot.”

Avalon Vintage Clothing
employee Donna Berardi
remembers these fashions.

“My mom made we wear them
when I was 4; nowl detest them,”
Berardl said.

However, the clothes of the
“disco—trash era" have returned,
according to Richard Parsakian,
owner of Eons Fashion Antiques.
These styles were reintroduced
about five years ago in the
underground clubs of London,
Milan and New York City, said
Parsakian. In Pittsburgh they were
first seen again about three years
ago, yet their rise in popularity in
the city has been relatively slow.

“You don’t see the general
public wearing them, only the
pace-setters,” said Parsakian.

This resurgence came about in
part due to a renewed interest in
disco-style music, according to
Parsakian. The popular new
music is called “House.”

“I use the word ‘confront’
deliberately because I am fearful
that despite the plaintive

that in fact we are going to

us all to go through this exercise
of 6.5- or 6—percent cuts, I think

be cut 10 or 20 percent. I think

FIJIS run
from Pitt

to Penn St.

for charity

By Aimee Wolﬂnger
Sta_ﬂ‘ wraer '

Seven members of Phi Gamma

Delta fraternity ran from Pitt

Stadium en route to State College

in the name of charity on Friday
‘ morning.

The run involved members

from both Pitt’s and Penn State's

FIJI chapters. Members of Pitt’s

chapter left Pitt stadium around 9

a.m. Friday, according to Sean
Goff, treasurer elect. The Pitt
runners met FIJI members from
Penn State’s chapter at a
designated halfway point later
that day.

‘We met at a gas station on
[Route] 22 in Johnstown, where
we made the exchange," said
Todd Aber, historian elect

— On Saturday, two members
from each chapter ran the ball
into Beaver Stadium in time for
kickoff. g

Proceeds from Pitt’s chapter
will be donated to the Spina
Bifida Association of Western
Pennsylvania, and Penn State’s
chapter will donate the funds it
raises to The Special Olympics.

“We’re giving‘ the money to
[Spina Bifidal because it is our
Greek Week charity,” said Goff.

According to Dave Forti, FIJI’s
Current president, the idea for the
run from Pitt to Penn State
originated in 1984. The last event
occurred in 1985.

The re-creation of the run was
brought up at FIJI’s national
convention, Ekklesia, in Chicago
this past summer, said Forti.

In order to find sponsors for
the run, Pitt Fljls sent mailers out

Men have a responsibility to
recognize the damage caused
' by pornography, according to
Majachael T ajchman, member
and co—founder of Men Against
Rape and Pornography.
After hearing John
Stolenberg speak at the
National Organization for Men
Against Sexism this past
summer, Tajchman became

getting men involved in these
issues. He and a few of his
friends began discussing the
ways pornography affected
their own lives and began
recognizing some of the harms
it caused, Tajchman said. They
decided to organize a group
around the issue.

There are presently about
25 members in MARAP. They
term themselves a conscience-
raising/political- action group
organized around the issues
of rape and pornography and
committed to ending and

- dismantling men’s violence.

“This is not a pro-censorship
group. The main way to stop
pornography is through
consciences raising so that men
recognize pornography for
what it is: sexual violence}

inspired to do something about .

Men need to recognize
danger of pornography

T ajchman said.

MARAP holds monthly
meetings at the Friends
Meeting house located at 4836
Ellsworth Ave. in Shadyside.
There are smaller committee-
type work groups within the
group that meet more often.

The group has not done
much politically yet, said
Tajchman, but the members
are currently reading works
written by female feminists to
better educate themselves.
They are examining how
pornography has affected
men’s lives, relationships and
views.

At a typical meeting
members usually speak about
something they have read or
are currently reading, and a
discussion follows based on
something all members have
read or are familiar with.

Tajchman said one of the
group’s main goals is to see
men talk more about the issue
of pornography. Pornography
is very overt in the media, said
Tajchman. No matter what the
form of pornography,
someone is being objectifred,
said Tajchman.

MARAP’s next meeting will
be on December 2 at Friends
Meeting House at 7:30 p.m..

businesses, said Forti.

According to Porti, the chapter
expects to raise about $1,500,
and the money it earns will go
toward rehabilitation of people
afflicted with spina bifida.

“During the first month of
pregnancy, the infants’ spines
don't develop correctly, and they
are born with no control of their
upper body,” said Ford. "The
rehabilitation can often help them
learn to walk and even drive a
car.”

According to Aber, the run was

. very successful and many passers-

by donated money.

‘It was really nice. We had
banners on the van saying we
were Pitt's FIJI chapter," he said.
“A lot of people would drive by
and honk. We got a lot of
donations while we Were
running."

not be reached to comment on
whether the administration will
appeal.

The election ballots will give
the faculty two options: no agent
or United Faculty. To render a
decision, only a majority of those
faculty voting is necessary. Wion
said that it is crucial that the
faculty get to vote before the new
president comes into office.

‘It is important that there be a
decision on the question one
way or the other, now before the
end of this academic year, so that
when the new president arrives
at Pitt, the new president will
know and itwill have been settled
whether the faculty will be
unionized or not. If not, then the
president can proceed. Ifthere is
going to be a union, then we will
do our very best to get off to a

= strong, positive cooperative start

with the new president, working
together to reach agreement on a
contract that will be good, not
only for the faculty, but for Pitt,
for students too,” Wion said.
Wion said that if the United
Faculty is chosen to represent the
faculty, the broadest advantage
will be a process for resolving
differences between the faculty
and the administration.
“Collective bargaining is
essentially a process, and it is one
that allows the two sides to sit
down together to negotiate and
to work out agreements. A lot of
our difficulties, I think, in recent

years at Pitt have been because
faculty through the senate and
other organizations have tried
very hard to get the administration
to hear what we are saying about
the importance of arts and
sciences for instance, the need

for a better balance between ,

teaching and research, the
importance of improving salaries
and of greater equity and fairness
in salaries,” Wion said.

“Too often we just have not
been able to find a way to reach
agreement on these matters
because ultimately, the
administration, after hearing
recommendations from the
senate, could unilaterally do what
it chose to do. With bargaining
we will have a process which will
ultimately lead to agreement, then
everyone will know where we
stand; the things agreed to will be

enforceable,” Wion said.

If the faculty votes for
unionization, there will be a
grievance procedure which will
enable faculty who feel they have
been treated unfairly to resolve
problems.

‘In general, it will make for a
more orderly and ultimately more
rational way of nrnning the
university, and I think that is
good for everybody," Wion said.

The recent faculty strike at
Temple University is probably
notsomethingthatwouldhappen
at Pitt under unionization, Wion
said.

‘First of all, strikes are very rare
in higher ‘education. Temp1e’s
was in spite of collective
bargaining, not because of it. I
don’t think it should be seen as
typical under collective
bargaining. It is not," he said.

Mil/emg the C615]? cows...

Last month, the federal government averted a shutdown
‘of the government by settling on a budget. Now the
University of Pittsburgh faces a similar situation.

On Nov. 5, Pitt President Wesley Posvar proposed a
budget that would put the university $14.5 million in debt.
This means that Pitt must find extra funds to make up for
this difference.

Provost Donald Henderson has suggested that one
possible solution to the crisis would be to cut all
departments in the university equally, by approximately
6.2 percent. This, he said, would compensate for the
deﬁcit and even allow_ for a_ 1—percent payback for
departments which are bringing in money to the university.

But the Faculty of Arts and Sciences disagrees. Many
believe that since FAS generates much of the money for
this university, it should not be constantly used “as an
automatic source for funds in times of crisis. Therefore,
they say that FAS should not have to bear as much of the
burden as other departments. FAS Dean Peter Koehler
called this department a “cash cow.”

According to University Senate Budget Policy Committee
Chairperson Donald McBurney, Pitt could help solve the
problem more readily by digging deeper into their
endowment fund. McBurney says that Pitt only uses 4
percent of the fund for budget considerations, while other
schools use an average of 6 percent.

There are many possible solutions to eliminate the
current deficit. An easy, short-term plan could be simply
to draw the money from the endowment fund necessary
to rub out the debt.

But the university needs a long-term solution. We
believe that a compromise between both Henderson’s

, plan and McBurney’s plan should be, if not adopted, at

least investigated for feasibility.

The university should raise their limit on budgetary uses
for the endowment to the 6 percent that McBurney
proposes.

On the other hand, if the university did this, it would
drastically reduce the amount of money needed to be
taken from individual departments. Then possibly the
university would only need to cut down by 2 percent, for
example, for each department.

Many people have suggested alternative methods for
eliminating the deficit, such as cutting heavily from the
athletic department. This plan would not only eliminate
the need for that but would also ease the burden so that
smaller departments would be affected equally with
larger ones such as athletics.

With this proposal, the university could save both itself
and its departments a lot of hassle and worry.

Towers’ security inadequate

Picture this: You’re sleeping at
3 a.m. on a Thursday, and you
live on a non—lounge floor in the
Litchﬁeld Towers, but you hear
the elevator door open and hear
males conversing in the hall.
Drowsy, you peek your head out
your bedroom door —— and see
three guys walking around.
Remember that this is a girls’
floor. None of them are injured
and deserving of an elevator key,
and none of them are resident
directors or members of the
housekeeping staff. They read
the names that are written on
colorful decorations (a treat from
your resident assistant) on the
doors, circle the ﬂoor once more
and exit via_the elevator.

Most of us don’t feel very safe
here and with good reason.

Could it be that anyone can
sign in a homicidal maniac (with
ID) at any time of the day in any
of the buildings? Or that stairwell
doors (in the towers) can be
opened by virtually any other
resident who knows the “jiggle”
system? Or that a number of
people in the towers have
obtained elevator keys (which
should be distributed only to
resident directors, housekeeping
staff and special cases) — which
means that they can gain access
to YOUR ﬂoor via the Huddle
elevator ANYTIME of day?

OK, so many of us have
wondered about it —- so why
isn’t Pitt doing something? I'll tell
you why — it's TOO COSTLY. I
suppose that the possibility of
rape or murder isn’t important
enough to change the locks.

In 1979, a female was murdered
in the laundry room of Tower A
(which was then located in the
basement of the towers) by
someone her roommate had
signed in. After the incident the
Resident Student Association
petitioned to have a washer and
dryer installed on each ﬂoor. This
was turned down because of the
noise that the machines would
have created, and one laundry

' room was placed in the lobby.

The RSA also wanted 24-hour
desk attendants, which it got, but
what good are they? Anyone can
still come into the building,
provided that this person knows
someone who will sign him or
her in. Besides, the attendants
don’t check IDs adequately, if
they check them at all.

The other day a friend of mine
(who lives in Tower A) and I
went to the “O” and decided to
bring our food to my room (in
Tower B). As an experiment for
this column, I hadhirn ﬂash his
ID to the desk attendant, and she
buzzed him in without a second
thought. Adequate security? I
think not

Lisa Raff

A few weeks ago two
roommates filled out separate
maintenance request forms ——
one for a bedroom—door lock
change and one to replace the
light bulbs in their rooms that
burned out. One day later the
lights were working, but the lock-
change request was given no
attention until their room was
broken into a week later. The
perpetrator took both girls’ MAC
cards. Afterthe break-in the lock
on their door was changed, as
well as the glass security-door
lock outside their bedroom.
However, if the lock had been
changed when it was requested,
the girls would not have been the
victims of burglary.

Here's another example: The
room key a friend of mine
received when he moved into
Tower A not only opens every
stairwell door in the building but
also the bedrooms of five people
on his ﬂoor.

Why is it that you can't get into
the towers with an ice cream
cone, but you can get in without
a valid ID?

Ira Horowitz, president of the
RSA for Tower B, said that “safety
and security of the students is a

priority.” Earlier this year the RSA
compiled a petition to change
the lock system in the towers.
The petition had approximately
200 signatures. The RSA then set
up a meeting with the Office of
Residence Life to discuss the
possibility of a lock change. The
ORL cancelled the meeting 10
minutes before it was scheduled
to begin, and it was never
rescheduled.

Bob Robinson of the ORL said
that he had no knowledge of
such a meeting or a petition and
that a plan for a lock conversion
in each residence is being
discussed. This conversion, he
said, is not deﬁnite, but he is 90
percent sure the change will be
made next summer. Amos Hall’s
locks were changed before this
semester began, and Robinson

feels the change is working fine.’

Horowitz also believes that “one
person behind a desk isn’t
enough, [but] everything costs

money.” This comment seems all"

too familiar around here. We pay

roughly $2,000 a year to live in‘

the residence halls, and part of
living here should be a feeling of
security in a supposedly secure
building.
Anyone who goes to school in
a city (or anywhere for that matter)
knows not to walk around at
night alone. This is especially
true in Oakland. Since Pitt
implemented the Oakland shuttle
system for our safety (quite a
helpful service and one worth
keeping around, I might add),
we don’t have to worry about
being alone in the streets. Yet we
still have to worry about who is
roaming our dormitories late at
night. Seeing three guys get off
the elevator on my ﬂoor at 3 a.m.
and going around reading names
on doors doesn’t exactly make
me feel comfortable about living
here. As students who pay tuition
and housing expenses, we should
have the right to feel safe in our
bedrooms.

Sour note...

PSU ends Pitt's disappointing season with ninth straight win

By Mike Rarnpa
Sports Editor

PAGE 7

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — When the opponent’s
quarterback has 79 more rushing yards on six fewer
carries than your top tailback, and your QB winds
up throwing four interceptions, it’s mighty hard to
find “a way to win.” In fact, it’s nearly impossible
not to lose.

And the Panthers watched a game against the No.
11 team in the nation fall right through its hands in
front of 85,180 fans packed into a cold and very
windy Beaver Stadium.

For Pitt head coach Paul Hackett, there was no
new news in the 22-17 defeat. The offense had its
moments but was underproductive enough to
waste a commendable defensive effort, and missed
opportunities and mistakes abounded at the wrong
times. The story line for this game did not deviate

long.

Curvin Richards fumbled and set up PSU’s first
score, while the Pitt offense couldn’t stick the ball
in the end zone from 12 yards out. The Panthers’
first TD was a ﬂuke, as Darnell Dickerson pulled
down an 18-yard Alex Van Pelt pass after it was
tipped right into his hands by a defensive back. But
the offense showed its capability midway through
the fourth quarter. Dickerson took a few steps into

-1'. the backfield to catch a Van Pelt lateral and then
riﬂed a perfect 63-yard bomb to a wide-open
Olanda Truitt to give Pitt a 17-16 lead.

All parties involved in executing that play said
that it had been run repeatedly in practice sessions
and had been successful every time. Pitt defenders
could not stop their offensive counterparts even

.. Football team earns mediocre grades for the season

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
Final grades won’t be handed
out for another month, but at 3-
7-1, the Panther football team’s
semester came to an early end
last Saturday against Penn State.

Not that it was unexpected, .

however. The Panthers finished
1-7-1 and didn’t win a game
after mid-October. The last time
Pitt lost five consecutive games
in a single season, Tony Dorsett
was a senior in high school, and
gasoline cost less than a

Ironically, in a year that Pitt
Coach Paul Hackett has
emphasized academics as well
as athletics, the Panthers’ grades
in the classroom should be better
than the following marks for
their disappointing on-the-ﬁeld
performances.

» OFFENSIVE LINE: Well, at
least these guys got a year’s
experience under their belt. This
group rolled with the punches
from the beginning of the year,
but youth and inexperience
showed. Quarterback Alex Van
Pelt applauded their efforts all
year for keeping defenders off
his back, but the running backs

cannot say the same. The Pitt
ground game never even got to
the line of scrimmage. C-
WH)E RECEIVERS: After
Olanda T ruitt and Darnell
Dickerson, there is no one even

ANALYSIS

worth talking about. Luckily,
those two combined to give the
Panthers long-range targets as
well as the Play of the Year
against Penn State. B
QUARTERBACIC Right from

the beginning, it was almost
unfair to expect Alex Van Pelt to
repeat the success he had last
year. But as the offensive captain,
he should have provided enough
leadership to overcome some of
the team’s frustrations. He didn’t.
When the coaches were out on
recruiting trips last week, the
team walkedits way through
drills that Hackett left for them
to do to execute at full speed,
not knowing that the coaches
were secretly videotaping the

' practice. All Van\Pelt could say

afterwards was, ‘We're
supposed to do it ourselves. He
gives us enough respect and

responsibility  and_ then we
go out and do something like
this.” Hopefully he’ll look at this
as a learning year. C
FULLBACKS: No one should
have to go through what Hackett
went through with the fullbacks
this year. Although walk-ons
and wrestlers and converted
tailbacks gave their best, Hackett
has to be hoping Santa will
bring him some fullbacks for
Christmas. Incomplete.

'* Panthers coast to easy Victory against NW Missouri St.

I

Byjim Tezak
Contributing Editor

Pitt basketball fans have a tradition of
clapping their hands in unison at the start
of every home game. They clap until the
Panthers make their first basket.

They applauded for exactly 10 seconds
last Friday until guard Jason Matthews
scored Pitt’s first basket of the season, a
jump shot from the top of the key.

Pitt scored the first basket of the game.

Pitt scored the last basket.

Pitt scored most of the baskets in between
in an 84-50 thrashing of Division II
Northwest Missouri State in a game which
saw Bobby Martin score his 1000th career
point.

Northwest Missouri State’s nickname is
the Bearcats, for anyone who cares.

The Pitt offense played sluggishly for

most of the first half, and the Bearcats held
a 17-15 lead with 8:05 remaining. Northwest
Missouri State Coach Steve Tappmeyer
offered an explanation for his team’s early
success against Pitt.

“They probably didn’t scout us out
enough to know who our three-point
shooters are,” he said.

“I was thinking, ‘Gosh, we aren’t
supposed to be down to a Division II
team,”’ said Pitt freshman Gandhi Jordan.
Jordan saw the most playing time of any of
Panther Coach Paul Evans’ host of
newcomers. He collected 10 points, six
rebounds and three steals in 20 minutes.

After a three-pointer by Keith Wilborn
gave the Bearcats a four-point lead, a free
throw by Pitt center Darren Morningstar
ignited a 17-0 run that put the Panthers up
for good.

Despite the run, Pitt’s offense never did

get untracked in the first half, and the
Panthers led only 32-21 at halftime.

Then, Brian Shorter took over.

“We lost our composure. We really lost
our poise in the second half,” Tappmeyer
said.

Shorter has a way of causing Panther
opponents to do that.

Shorter, who didn’t play in the first half
and missed most of the preseason due to
a viral infection, played 15 minutes in the
second half and scored 11 points. He also
fired up a Pitt offense that collected 52
points and shot 63 percent in the second
half.

Shorter said that he felt “definitely above
50 percent” of his full strength.

“I think I was rushing a little bit on my
offense. I need to take my time. All it is
now is me getting in better shape,” Shorter
said.

Pitt’s defense was impressive against
the Bearcats, especially the full-court press.
The press helped force NW Missouri State
into committing 26 turnovers.

“I was just hoping [Evans] would save
the press until as late as possible. We're
just not used to having to go over people
that size,” T appmeyer said.

Evans said that he didn’t employ the
full-court pressure early because the Pitt
coaching staff hadn't had much time to
scout the Bearcats.

Miller, who missed last season with a
foot problem, started the game at point
guard but had only one shot and did not
score in 25 minutes of playing time. He did
have six assists and committed no
turnovers.

Bobby Martin, Darelle. Porter and
Matthews scored 14 points each to lead six
Panthers in double figures.

THE P111‘ NEWS, Monday, November 26, 1990

Pointing the finger at Hackett unfounded

As the 1990 Pitt Panthers hang
up their pads for good, they’ll
leave behind endless speculation
as to why they didn’t come close
to measuring up to the preseason
expectations of a Top 20 ranking,
a bowl bid and potential Heisman
Trophy candidates.

Yes, it’s a long way from players
talking in football camp at
Johnstown about how nothing
short of a Jan. 1 bowl would do.
A losing record was not even a
remote possibility for even the
most realistic of athletes. But who
would have thought this would
be the same team who wound up
5-7-1 for the year.

This is deﬁnitely not what the
doctor ordered.

And who is to blame for all of
this? For some bizarre reason,
people want to point the finger
and axe Paul Hackett, the root of
all Panther evil. After one season.

That’s just brilliant.

Hackett once claimed while
being questioned about this
season that he didn’t recruit his
present group of players, he just
coached them. And then the walls
came tumbling down. Hackett
was under massive ﬁre. Why?

First of all, his statement is true.
In his first year as a head coach,
Hackett has had to play with the

cards that have been dealt to him
from the Gottfried era, an era that
many remember as being
unpleasant to say the least, at the
end. Hackett has had no time to
institute his players in his system.

 

Mike
Rampa

Hackett is also dealing with a
coaching staff that boasts five
first—year (officially) assistants,
including Fred vonAppen, Chuck
Jones (tight ends), Skip Peete
(receivers), Nick Rapone
(secondary) and Marvin Lewis
(outside linebackers).

Pitt football has certainly been
a mark of instability over the
years. Since John Michelosen’s
10-year tenure from 1955-65, no

Panther head coach has lasted
more than five years. The impact
of change in coaching certainly
has an effect on a player’s ability
to get entrenched in a system.
How can anyone get entrenched
in a system after one year?

“Changes reach you in all kinds
of areas because change is so
dramatic,” Hackett said after the
Penn State game.

“I’ve watched changes affect
this team since l’ve been here
and I think that’s wounded our
ability to be successful in the first
year. But as I look to the second
and third years, I would like to
make as few changes as possible
and keep everything intact. We
don’t have very many people on
our football team that have been
coached by the same man more
than two years."

Take Penn State for example.
There isn’t a player on the Nitanny
Lions that has had a different
position coach than when he
arrived in Happy Valley.

At Pitt, some players have had
four position coaches, most have
had three and all at least two.
That’s a lot of different opinions
and techniques to ingest involving
a complex game over the course
of a four—year career. The lack of
stability is one of Pitt’s most

serious problems, and it is the
first one Hackett is looking to
correct
And speaking of looking down
the road, Hackett is truly the
unfair victim of a win at all costs
and win now society. Hackett
speaks of building a program,
not immediately installing one.
He speaks of the importance of
academics, Pitt’s new classroom
standards and finding recruits
who want to be a part of and
grow with the new program. He
speaks with the future in mind.
Not instantaneous gratification in
the present. This is a man of
vision committed to building a

' solid football program.

And let’s talk credentials.
Hackett has been coaching at the
college and professional level
since 1970; that’s about as long as
most Pitt students have been alive.

He has worked with some of the .

most revered quarterbacks in the
pros as well as being a part of one
of the most successful franchises
in pro football history.

“Paul has a very intuitive and
creative football mind. He is one
of those rare individuals for whom
football actually seems to be part
of his intellectual makeup,” said
Bill Walsh.

Paul Hackett is Pitt’s ticket to
ride over the coming years. To
point the finger at him for Pitt’s
disappointing season this year is

Continued from page 7
when they knew that play
was coming, according to
Dickerson and Truitt.

But that play is where the
success story started and
ended against Penn State.
‘'9 “Our football team
thought the game was over
with eight minutes to go,”
said Hackett. “We played
hard, but that wasn’t good
enough; you have to play
well. When the ball hits
you in the hands, you've
got to catch it; and when
12. you throw four
interceptions, you’re not
going to beat anybody.”

Somehow, PSU
quarterback Tony Sacca
managed to blister the
Panther defense for a
career-high rush of 50 yards,
setting up a Sam Gash TD
in the second quarter. Sacca
3’. then rewrotehis own record

book and became the
afternoon’s leading rusher
as he ran for 55 yards in the
fourth quarter to set up a
Craig Fayak field goal.

“What’s disappointing to
me is that a guy ought to do
that once, and the second
time he should be taken
out of the game. You ought
to hit him so hard that you
blow him up and he doesn’t
come back,” Hackett said.

“That’s the theory of why
quarterbacks don't run,

. because they get punished.
And we couldn’t even touch
him, let alone punish him.”

Van Pelt wound up
punishing both himself and
his team as his four
interceptions stalled
successful drives and
brought an overworked
defense back onto the field.
Hackett’s plan for the latter
stages of the game was to
control the ball in the third
quarter in order to step up
a notch in the fourth to play
with the wind at his team’s
back.

But the offense controlled
next to nothing in the third
quarter as it was on the
ﬁeld for only four minutes
and failed to score.

“We really laid an egg
out there in the third
[quarter], and I just didn't
get the job done in any
way, shape or form,” said
Van Pelt.

DEFENSIVE BACKS: These
guys had a worse year than
Donald Trump. Opposing wide
receivers were open by 15 yards
at times. A lack of speed and
missed tackles rendered this troop
almost totally ineffective. F

SPECIAL TEAMS: Although
Brian Greenﬁeld probably lost
his NCAA punting title against
Penn State, a 45.6 punt average
still set the Pitt record and will
earn him All-American status and
NFL employment Vernon Lewis
and Scott Kaplan also had
memorable years for Coach Scott

deserves a winter’s vacation, it's
Paul Hackett. Injuries,
suspensions and erratic play were
all a major part of HacketI’s debut
act, but the first-year coach never
wavered his position of authority
on this team — although he may
have lost a few more hairs in the
process. There will probably be a
lot of talk of firing Hackett, or
even of his leaving, but that’s
completely unfounded

"I'm not interested in a job
anywhere else. There's too big a
job to be done here," Hackett
said.

Fred vonAppen, Bill Meyers
and the rest of the position
coaches did their best to lay a
base for the future, but they
never really had control over
their players. 3

Another negative point was
the predictability of Pitt's offense.

Almost every team that beat the
Panthers said Pitt showed them
nothing new and they almost
knew what the Panthers were
going to do. C

Overall, the team is probably
glad to have their Pitt—i—ful season
end, and they can look forward
to next year. That won't solace
fans who want a winner this year,
but at least the basketball team is
