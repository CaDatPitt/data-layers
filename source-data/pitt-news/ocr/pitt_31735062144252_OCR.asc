Case of Mysterious Organist
Solved by ‘News’ Reporter!

During the recent summer semester, the University of Pittsburgh
had, for‘the pleasure of the enrollment, a talented organist who played

every Thursday for one-half hour.
into the Commons room, opened
agenda, and began playing. After
the organ, and walked out without

This man nonchalantly walked
the organ, collected his musical
his half hour interlude, he closed
a word.

The quali'ty of his playing was in itself not uncommon; his ap-

proach and manner, however, def-e
initely was mysterious. Each time
he made his: entrance a volley of

questions were asked around the
Commons room. Naturally with
the instinctive “nose for news” a
reporter was dispatched to ﬁnd
out about this strange musician.

To the questions, who is he,
where did he come from, Why does
he choose to :play the organ, and
where does he go upon completion
of his daily recitals, these answers
were found:

The organist’s name is George
Currier, his home is in Erie, and
he is taking a graduate course in
history. He graduated from the
University of Pittsburgh in 1943
with a bachelor of science degree.
George is manager of Psi Chi Eta
fraternity. Taking piano for seven
years he decided to try the organ.
After a few lessons from Fred
Lotz, Heinz chapel organist, he
carried on mastering the intraca-
cies of the organ. At present he
lives on North Belleﬁeld avenue.

Prof Bromilow
Leads Reform

In Association

The E&M student association,
inactive the past year, will reor-

ganie. Associate Professor Frank‘

Bromilow of the civil engineering
department is lending the reform-
ing of the student cabinet.

The intended cabinet would be
composed of 18 representatives-
one senior and one junior from
each of the nine departments.
Along with -Professor Bromilow,
the cabinet would function as a
governing and organiing body for
social activities in the E & M
School.

In last week’s joint seminar,
Professor Bromilow stated, “In
order to assure successful reor-
ganiation of the cabinet, we must
have the full support of every en-
gineering student.”

Lounge May Be Installed

Before the cabinet became inac-
tive a year ago, it sponsored semi-
annual dances, annual smokers,
intermural contests and other
special events.‘ -Most prominent
among its projects was the open-
ing of a student lounge in the
basement of State hall. The lounge
was c-losed last fall due to the
need of rooms for Army person-
nel, since the withdrawal of the
ASTP, space has again become
available for the lounge.

During the inactivity of the as-
sociation, $300 was obtained from
social affairs and from the “coke”
machine at State hall.

The ﬁrst issue of the Pitt News ran an editorial in this col-
?-umn enttitled “Back to Normalcy”, which was prompted by a
statement, overheard at the beginning of the school term, to wit,
‘_‘_This year we are starting on the road back to normal Pitt life”.
When we heard that glad piece of information, it was like sweet
m\u=si,c, tto tired cars. We thought it the best news we had heard
~ liriaﬂlong time and passed it on in the paper, by way of a con-
ventional and traditional greeting to the student body at the’
o_1_1j_cset'of,the new school year.

  
 

  
 

   
  

   

  

   

It wasia subject that could be easily misinterpreted. \Ve
knew that; we expected some repercussions. And did we get
them! .An angry rumble of dissent became audible at 8:30
V o’clock Wednesday morning when the News went on the stands.
‘I ‘The grapevine immediately got to work, and the acid comments
started pouring ‘in.

 
   
  

I Outraged khaki—clads carrying laundry bags collared us in
the halls; others, righteously indignant, stormed the ofﬁce to se-
cure copies of the paper so that they could quote verbatim;
amused co-eds read excerpts from vitriolic: letters of ex—Pitt-
stationed cadets and ASTS. The accusations ranged from our
, being unhospitable to the servicemen stationed here to cynical
’ digs at our mental equipment. Did we think the Armistice had
been signed?

 
   

  

   

    
 

,Not quite. »Maybe we have no adequate defense. Very

‘ for what it is worth, is our explanation.

3  In the ﬁrst place, don’t be misled into believing that the
;.student body or the administration is praising God that the
great majority of the Army is gone and that the rest may leave
,;n,'the near future. ‘We haven ’t resented you being here. Rath-
,.eI/',' we have enjoyed it immensely. It has been an experience that
we welcomed. We won’t soon forget the Air Crew marching up
ti(l'),""l‘rees,_ cladin blue and gold, singing lustily “out of the wide
'« blue yonder.”- Nor the fun we had in the stuffy, smoke-blue,
, Owl office. ‘(Now that they’re gone and there ’s no fear of wing
1-boards, it won’t hurt to tell.) The AST band at the football
,games, the Schenleyi tea dances-afterwards, ESGC Co—op com-
3 inittee meetings—we still reminisce over thoseigood times. Most
§f_the servicemen will admit that the‘ welcome they received
here was wholehearted.

  

  
  
 

 

But just because we did enjoy your stay doesn’t mean that

have can’t appreciate. the alleviation of space difficulties, limited
: equipment, curtailed courses, and a restricted faculty. It is
partly because of your departure that the problems were rem-
7edied.Tha:t doesn’t imply we’re glad you’re gone. If we had
‘“ it to choose, you’d all be back here en force. However, there
has been improvement, and it is only human for us to take ad-
-‘vantage of it. _

 
  
  
  
  
   

We haven’t forgotten the war! Far from it. The peace ta-
ble is yet in sight. We realize that. It is clouding the issue to
insinuate that we do harbor such notions, just ‘because we make
a simple statement that we’re glad to be getting back to normal.

Possibly it sounds as though we are gloating over our good
‘fortune or are unduly anxious about trivial, selﬁsh problems. But
., that is not our attitude; it never has been. It is unfortunate
7that the editorial conveyed that impression. Perhaps it was
not clearly enough worded. Or it may have been an inoppor-

tune time for such a. theme. '

Twelve Volumes

Present History

A basically sound knowledge of
American history can be obtained
by reading twelve current books,
according to Bernard DeVoto,
not-ed historian. “

Writing" in the October issue of
Good Housekeeping magazine, De-
Voto lists: ‘Clark Wissler’s Indians
of the United States; The.Growth
of the American Republic by San;
uel E. Morrison and Henry Com-
ager; The Heritage of America by
Commager and Allan N-evins;
Charles A. Beard’s The Republic;
Ulrich B. Phillips’ Life and La-
bor in the Old South; J. G. Ran-
dal1’s The Civil War and Recon-
struction; Jackson Turner’s The
Frontier in American History;
Ro“ger Burlingame’s March of the
Iron Men; The Age of Enterprise
by Thomas ‘C. Cochran and Wil-
liam Miller; Marcus Lee Han-
sen’s The Immigrant in American
History; Walter Prescott Webb’s
The Great Plains; an-d Inez
Haynes Irwin’s Angels and Am-
azons. .

“Every book on the list is not
only sound but excellent reading,”
DeVo'to states. “All but one are
recent and therefore contempor-
ary in view and easily obtaina-
ble.”

E & M Enrollment Rises

Approximately .210 undergradu-
ates registered in the ‘School of
Engineering and Mines. Dean E.
A. Holbrook said, “The number
exceeded our expectations by
about 20%.”

The registration ‘figures for the
evening school have not been
compiled but they too are expect-
ed to far exceed the ﬁgures of the
past few years. The most noticea-

This column is’t going to have
any deﬁnite pattern. I intend writ-
ing about anything and everything
that concerns Pitt and Pitt stu-
dents in the coming year, and the
topics are going to be varied. This
week, I’m going to give way to my
feelings about the last two foot-
ball games Pitt has played, but
remember, please, that this not
a sports column.

What’s wrong with student sup-
port and enthusiasm, this season,
no one has been able to tell me. I
certainly can’t explain it myself,
but something is deﬁnitely on the
slump when the cheer leaders
have to go up into the stands,
pleading with the student body to
get a little pep into them.

You might say the wallo-p Notre
Dame handed our team last week-
end dampened spirits, but I feel
that’s hardly reasonable. We won
our first game with West Virginia,
and even then, student support
was just no good. The cheer lead-
ers practically carried the cheers
themselves.

In regard to the Notre Dame
battle, it might suffice to say here
that more teams have won becanse
of the fans’ urging and enthusiasm
than a lot of people realize. Our
boys «certainly had no such dem-
onstration from the stadium these
past two Saturdays. How do you
think the eleven of them feel
when they are getting knocked
around the Iﬁeld, hearing a few
weak horrahs from the sidelines?
Why do you go to our games, any-
way—to eat hot dogs and peanuts?

The. pep rally in Foster me-
morial Friday afternoon certainly
was no indication of the Saturday
attitude. Everyone expected great
results, for the rally pitch attained
was wonderful. What happened
between Friday afternoon and the
following ‘Saturday, well, that’s
something elso no one can ey-
plain.

I don’t, for one instant, feel that
this column will change the sit-
uation to any marked degree. The
students are the ones who can do
that; so you see, everything’s up
to_ you. That sums up the idea
rather neatly. —

‘On with the news!

Flash. George Smith has found
a new loafing place: Kaufmann’s
lingerie department. Tell us Smit-
tie, what’s the main attraction? If
I know you, it’s the gal behind the
counter.

Seen at the Vogue Terrace last
Saturday night were Al Dobbie
and Walt Popiel. Hey men! Those
two blondes you were with could
be stand ins for Powers’ models
any day. Any chance of a tele-
phone number?

A double blast on this one.

he was a good man, even if stole-

Do you have trouble with your

' mailman?

If you do, see Walt Stewart be-
cause he handled his mailman a la
king. Walt was given the alterna-
tive of either cutting down on the

’ 14 perfumed letters he receives

from Missouri each week or mov-
ing. His new address is 4712 Bay-
ard street. Lots of mail for the
Delts.

Let’s delve into the past and dig
up the changes that took place
from June to September:

Lee Ziegler got a new Marine

‘Vick Fondrk practically ﬂunk-
ed out-he hit a 2.5 instead of the

'AMarion Conner added 15 odd

Deacon Wells found a date.

Lorna Hazleton changed from
the Navy to the Army- Air Force.

Dick Slater had a little argu-
ment with Uncle Sam and had to
change his theme song from

We Do In the Infantry.’’

Last of all here’s a question for
the three point-ers:

Who’s the would be “All Ameri-
can Boy” who's causing so much

pus?

Hi, fellas . . Hi gals .
we’re off again . . . aw, you can’t
stop us, so quit muttering .

Climax to last week’s story
about Terry Gormley and Bill
Henntzelman is that she’s now
pinned to him . Yep, that
Heintzelman’s a smart lad .
Also, the reason you see so many
of the boys beaming is that
Jeanne Gousha decided to come
back to Pitt She changed
her mind ’bout staying in Wash-
ington the last minute . . . Hap-
py day, the guys tell us . . . The
ZTAs -had noos for us, too, but
deﬁnitely . . . Nancy Hardy was
married to Bill Heisler, likewise
Fidelis Home to Tommy Perkin-
son, and likewise (are we repeat-
ing ourselves?) Ruth Besch to
Major Atlee Van Fleet . . _. Some
excitement, huh? . . .

Bill Veenis didn’t waste any
time getting around to Betty Mae
Pogenbcrger, that new blonde
bombshell we told ya about . . .
He took her to the PiKa party the
Sat. before last . . . Here’s a new
angle for you . . . Jean “Butch”
Wykoff is interested in her room-
mate’s brother, a dashing Lieu-
tenant in the Air Corps, and her
room mate Jean Mostellor is in-
terested in Butch’s brother, a lee-
ovely navy man . . . The four of
them are having a gay time of it,
believe us . . . Word has reached
us (via our spies) that Pitt now
has an ex-Wac among the lusci-
ous coeds . . . Believe her name
is Betty Louu llludwig A
photographer (and this is news!)
took pictures of the TPAS at
Ginny Ballard’s party the other
week . . . Also, the week end of
the Notre Dame game, Marianne
White. entertained some friends
from Cleveland, who in turn had
a party for the TPAS at the Wil-
liam Penn . . For details, see
the girls . ,. . They tell us it was
nothing less than wonderful . . .

Dick Richardson talked his love-
ly into coming to Pitt this year

. . She’s staying at the Tri-Delt
house . Hasn’t anyone told
the boy about the wolves around
here? . . . Just asking, just ask-
ing . . . Happy item . . . The sol-
dier lad whose wings Joy Gluck
is wearing, formerly reported
missing in action, has been found
and is now somewhere in England
. . . We enjoy hearing things like
that.

And with this happy note, we
end our colyum . . . buttt, we’ll
be back again next week
sorry aren’t’cha?

YW Sends Gifts
To War Victims

A call has been sent out by the
YWCA for Christmas gifts of
clothing to be sent to war refugees
in Europe. Any new or practical-
ly new wearing apparel is des-
perately needed by these war vic-
tims.

Those wishing to make contri-
butions should wrap their gifts in
a Christmas wrapping and enclose
a Christmas card. All "gifts must
then be brought to Mrs. Edna
Todt Bates of the YWCA any
week day before October 14. Miss
Blossom Henry of the French de-
partment or Mary Lou Stack, C,
who heads the committee, will
also be glad to receive your con-
tribution. .

The gifts will then be sent to
the Refugee committee of the
American Friends, who will dis-
tribute them through their Geneva
ofﬁce to refugees in Europe.

Last year Pitt students and fac-
ulty members contributed more
than a hundred gifts for this
worthy cause. Mrs. Bates stated,
“The YWCA hopes that the num-
ber will be larger this year.”

15 Nurses’ Aides
Needed for Duty ‘

The Newton D. Baker hospital
at Martinsburg, W. Va., has put in
an urgent call to the Volunteer
Nurses’ Aid department of the
Pittsburgh chapter, American Red
Cross, for 15 nurses’ aides with
150 volunteer hours to their credit
to report for duty on October 1.
This appeal is necessitated by the
greatly increased number of
wounded men coming from over-
seas who need plastic surgery, the
facilities for which are not now
adequately staffed by the present
number of nurses and scheduled
nurses’ aides.

Applications for service at the
Newton D. Baker hospital will be
taken at the Volunteer Nurses’
Aide department of the Pittsburgh
Red Cross, Wabash station. The
telephone number is GRant 1680.

THE PITT NEWS

Gay Telephhne Operator

You might not know it, but the
chances are nine out of ten you’ve
talked to Ann “Hello!” Laughrey.
Ann, who has been a telephone op-
erator at Pitt “26 years last
March” (she says proudly) has
connected you with the registrar’s
oﬂice, the dean of men, and your
favorite professor. You have, in
fact, probably kept her wrapped
up in cord at least a dozen times.

Her small office on the third
ﬂoor of the Cathedral is a little
buzz nest of activity. She pulls
cords, pushes cords, snaps buttons,
and laughs infectiously with a
companion operator during lulls--

when there are lulls. She just
doesn’t get tired.
Ann’s congeniality is demon-

strated by the number of visitors
she receives. Janitors stop in for
a smoke, medical students sta-
tioned on the third ﬂoor stand in
the doorway and cheer her on
when she’s at her busiest . .
“when I’m ‘getting cr-oss-eyed
looking at the switchboard,” Ann
says good humoredly.

'She’s married, has two little
daughters, one of whom she thinks
is going to be a telephone operator.

 “I hope she does become one,”

Ann remarked. “She’ll never have

a dull moment.

Ann likes Pitt students and
knows quite a few of them. At
the present, she wants to know
what ever became of Benny But-
ler, who she thinks isia former
Pitt boy. She isn’t sure of that.
She just knows she was receiving
very delightful post cards from
him until St. Patrick’s day, from
all over the country. He hasn’t
written since, and she’s worried.
If anyone knows who or where
Benny Butler is, Ann says she
would appreciate receiving the in-
formation.

When asked how much longer
she expects to stay at Pitt, gray-
eyed Ann smiled widely. “Well.

this-is the secona war I’ve been

here, and I will not. positively
not, be here for the third.”

At this point she broke off and
returned to the switch board.
“Hello . . . Dr. Elmer’s line is
busy. Oh, you’re Dr. Elmer! Oh,
my aching back!”

Heinz Choir Sets
Year’s Schedule

That Pitt still likes its music is
illustrated by the large turnout
this semester for Heinz Chapel
choir. Forty members, the largest
number in recent years, will serve
under the direction of Mr. Theo-
dore Finney, professor and head
of the department of music appre-
ciation.

A vigorous program has been
outlined for the choir this year.
In addition to singing at the
Caritas, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and Easter programs, the Chapel
choir will also participate in serv-
ices to be held on various Fridays
from 1 to 1:30 o’clock. The ﬁrst
of these programs will be this Fri-
day, October 6. The soprano so-
loist, Doris Simmons, has already
been selected.

Mr. Finney emphasized that, al-
though the turnout for Heinz choir
was quite good this year, there is
always need for more male voices
in the group. All men who are
interested are urged to attend re-
he rsals in the Chapel every day
except Monday from 4:30 to 5:30
o’clock.

this action it is expected that the
Federation of Social Agencies and
the Unitarian Service committee
will join the Jefferson club so that
means and technical assistance
will be available.

Among the speakers ‘will be
Professor David Rogers of the
University of ‘Pittsburgh and Miss
Gertrude Wilson of the Univer-

Science.

Wife: I can’t decide whether to

full body for the weddings of two
of their members. Shirley Rattner
became the bride of Morris Leiber-
man, a Pitt graduate, on August
27, and Doris Deaktor married
Mervin Binstock, Pitt dental stu-
dent, on September 3. The Phi
Sigs are still talking about how
lovely the girls looked in their
white gowns. At a recent tea at
the sorority apartment the sisters
bid farewell to Pauline Tisherman.
Pauline moved to California to at-
tend University of California at
Los Angeles where she will be-
come an active member of the Phi
Sig’s Zeta Chapter.

After last week’s column (my
ﬁrst) I rushed up to the Pitt News
ofﬁce to read my fan mail. And as
I read the one letter, I found it
was from my draft board, and
they hadn’t read the column any-
way.

But enough of my troubles, and
on to more important matters. The
Delts are very sure that they have
the most original pledge group on
campus. Last week. a few of the
pledges were assigned. to shovel
coal into the cellar. They had
been given a two hour time limit,
and when the brothers returned,
an hour and a half later, they
found two strange men doing the
work that the pledges had been
assigned to do. The men had been
hired to ﬁnish the work, and the
pledges had gone to bed.

The Phi Delts are planning a big
victory dance at their house on
the evening of the Bethany game.
That is, they hope it will be a vic-
tory dance, and we join them in
‘hoping that the Panther will down
the Bethany Bison.

Last Thursday the Phi Eps cele-

brated their Founder’s day with a ’

banquet, held at the Schenley ho-_
tel. In addition to the whole ac-
tive chapter, there were many of
the fraternity’s alumni present.
The evening’s entertainment in-
cluded speeches from many of the
alumni and sound movies pictur-
ing the marines at Saipan. After

the pictures the old and new frat- _

ers got together for a good old
fashioned bull session about fra-
ternity life here at Pitt.

Just ask the Phi Gams what the V‘
is, and‘ A

favorite autumn affair
they’ll tell you that it’s a hayride.
And if you get even more in-

quisitive, you’ll hear that the Phi _

Gams are having a hayride next
Saturday night. The boys are also

hoping that they’ll be able to cele-ii:
brate a Pitt victory at the same,

time.
The PiKAs held a buffet supper

at their house after the Notre‘_
Dame game last week. The boys‘

brought their dates down from the

game and stayed after dinner for H

a house dance.

The Pi Lams held their elections I

last week. Paul Weber is rex; Ar-
nie Steinman, archon; Sylvan Pen-
ner, keeper of excvhequer; Joe

Meyer, marshall; Larry Yahr, tell-I

er. The new initiates of the fra-

ternity are Myles Berkowitz, Mel-

vin Schiff, Marty Wekselman, Ger-
ry Weiner, and Larry Yahr. I
The S~AEs had a house dance on

the,evening of the Notre Dame;
game. As their honored guests,.

they had two members of the No-
tre Dame eleven.

Sigma Chi came through with a
new slate of ofﬁcers for the year.
Milton Tokash is the new presi-
dent; Jackson Ice, vice—president;
Herky Knell, treasurer; Tom Con-

lin, recording se-cretary; Ed Con- ~

It was a real surprise to pick

i.T.he rumors that Glenn Miller

Miller is now in England conduct-

supreme allied command in BBC

Tommy Dorsey is featuring a
trio made up of Buddy Rich,
Buddy de Franco and Dod-o Mar-
marosa. The latter two are Pitts-
burgh boys. Dodo graduated
fro-m Peabody high school.

Peggy Mann is leaving Gene
Krupa’s new band to do a solo

STAN KENTON — (Artistry in
Rhythm—-Eager Beaver)

Capit-ol 159

In my opinion this is the best
record release of all summer.
“Artistry in Rhythm” is Kenton’s
theme song. It is arranged in a
semi-symphonic vein that keeps
you on edge throughout the rec-
ord guessing what will happen
next. The many changes in tem-
po make this strictly a record to

listen to but once you hear it
you will want to hear it over
again and again. “Eager Beaver”
is simply a better than average
instrumental number played in
Kenton’s distinctive style.

America’s New Volcano

University has announced that Dr.
Parker D. Trask, of the United
States Geological Survey, will
give an illustrated lecture on
“Paricutin, North America’s New-

October 6, at 8 o’clock, in the

.Hotel William ‘Penn.

During the deve‘opment of this
volcano, Dr. Trask was stationed
in the vicinity taking colored pic-
tures and studying its activity.

The meeting is sponsored by
the Engineers’ society of West.
ern Pennsylvania. All students
and faculty members are invited

After Class

It has been the policy of the
school to encourage student and
instructor talks. The “after class
explanation” is always helpful.
But, beginning October 16, don’t
bother your prof for at least two
minutes after ciass! That’s right.
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Student Health service for men,
made this appeal to all students.
Also, if you see your professor
taking his pulse after and before
class, don’t be alarmed. In way
of explanation, this quotation was
taken from the University an-
nouncements:

“The Student Health service for
men would like the co-operation
of at least 200 faculty members in
making aseries of observations
for a period of two weeks. The
observations concern the cost in
heart beats of teaching. The only
effort involved on the part of the
faculty member is counting his
own pulse rate immediately before
teaching, immediately after teach-
ing, and after two minutes’ rest.
Please send your name to the Stu-
dent Health service office, and a
blank and necessary instructions
will be sent to you. The observa-
tions will begin the week of Octo-
ber 16.”

The object of this test is to es-
tablish a similar pattern of heart
reaction to teaching efiforts. Thr.
general impression is, in many
circles, that teaching does not
make severe demands upon the
teacher. This investigation V/il‘.
establish definitety the demands
made upon teachers.

“Previous similar experiences,”
said Dr. ‘Carlson, “have led to the
deduction that emotional clrarna
kills more people than physical
activity.” The director of the
Student Health service for men
added, “It is hoped that at least

short lull over the summer session.
The competition for all point
trophy is beginning to thin out,
but, nevertheless, there remains
the traditional rivalry between the
various lraternities. The events
which have already been com-
pleted are swimming, track, and
softball. The unofficial tabulation
shows that the PiKAs are leading
followed by the Phi Gams and the
Delts. Remaining to be played be-
fore the all point trophy is given
out are basketball and football.

300 members of the faculty will
lend their ‘co-operation over a
period of two weeks so that con-
clusive results may be obtained.”

These experiments which are of
great value and importance begin
October 16. The co—operation of
the faculty will be appreciated.
The co-operation from the student
body will be expected. Once again
this is stressed: “Don’t bother
your prof until two minutes after
class”

A Great Day For The Irish
Has anybody here seen Kelly‘?
not the Kelly with the big fat
belly, but the Kelly that led the
Irish to victory. Kelly, one of the
three Irish lads on Notre Da~rne’s

grid squad, gave a great account
of himself in three quarters of
play. Ke].ly alone crossed the Pan-
ther goal four times and split the
uprights twice for 26 of the Irish
58 points. The big question mark
that existed at pre-game time
about the Irish power was cleared.
by one word, “Kelly,” as he habit-
ually crossed the Pitt goal.

The Panther Caged

'- The Panther was the perfect
host to the Notre Dame squad at
their 1944 “T” party. It might
have been the Notre Dame tradi-
tion or it might have been the
packed stadium, anyway, ‘Pitt had
the jitters and the Irish walked
away with a victory. It didn’t act
like the same team that defeated

The 200 pound line folded as the
Irish piled up 12 of their 15 ﬁrst
downs on the ground.

Oﬂensively Pitt did very well
on their short spot passes over the
Irish line, but the long passes fail-
ed to hit their mark and aided
greatly in Pitt’s defeat. The sub-
dued Panther further aided the
green clad cause along by fum-
bling the pig skin nine times, fail-
ing to recover six of them; and
then, to boot, Notre Dame inter-
cepted a half dozen passes which
turned into scoring opportunities.

Win ’em All

‘Doc Carlson has slated an early
session for those who wish to try
out for this year’s basket squad. At

 

ising for the Carlsonmen. Only
Apple, Biehl, and Ragan remain
among last seasons starters, but
Doc -has a great bunch of fresh-

Mocha Leads B is ans

1

“When tlie_Be'thany College foot-
ball team pulls into town, there
will be a familiar face among the
players, that of Joe Mocha. Mocha,
a former freshman star of the

Panthers, will appear in the role
of the Bison quarterback. Mocha
transferred to the V-12 at Bethany
shortly after his freshman term.
Although his stay at the Univer-
sity was short, his name was on
the lips of every football fan be-
cause of his outstanding play as
a Panther. Many experts on the
ﬁeld of football sometimes com-
pare his playing to that of Jay
Berwanger and Frankie Albert.
The highlight of Mocha’s career

ii

i
came during tile Pitt‘-i1’iiinois game
in which he completed 14 out of
17 forward passes. Here the com-
bination Mocha to Maloney
brought a hopelessly beaten Pitt
eleven back into the game. Had
it not been for the clock, Mocha
might have spurred the Blue and
Gold on to victory. This year
Mocha will be playing for a rival
eleven. His speed and passing ac-
curacy combined with the hard
running of Don Owen should give
the Bethany team a pretty far of-
fense. However, Bethany’s coach,
John Knight, must rely on the
trusty right arm of Mocha if he
expects to cross the goal line many
times this year.

Pitt’s offensive power should
explode with a roar. Last Satur-

fuse, and—well—we don’t talk

Discharged Nurse Becomes
First Woman Vet at Pitt

“Men Only” no longer applies to the Veterans’ association at Pitt.
The name of Lucy Sproat, veteran Army nurse from Dawson, Pa.,

has been added to the roster.

Miss Sproat is enrolled in the Pitt School of Nursing and is can-
didate for the degree of bachelor of science in nursing education,

In the service she was Lt. Lucy Sproat who for nineteen months
was attached to the Eighth Service Command in Texas.

“It certainly broke my heart,” was Lucy’s sincere comment about

her discharge which was brought about by an unsuccessful operation

on a tendon in her left leg. 9

Miss Sproat is a graduate of the
Frick Memorial hospital, Mt.
Pleasant and attended Duquesne
University before and after serv-
ing in the Army.

When Miss Sproat enlisted in
September, 1942, and was sent to
Camp Hood, Texas, little did she
think that soon there would be
among her friends the well-known
war correspondent, Ernie Pyle.

They were introduced by Cap-
tain McCollum, a friend from the
‘roving reporter’s’ home town,
Albequerque, New Mexico. The
Captain is now serving in France.

When Lucy was transferred to
General hospital, lVIcClosky, Texas,
and Ernie was sent overseas their
friendship did not end.

While on a shopping trip in

., London with Captain McCollum

and his son, Ross, Ernie purchased
and sent home to Lucy a silver
salt dish.

Attached, under the lid, was
this note, “Consider the enclosed
your delayed birthday and Christ-
mas gift or anything you wish. I
saw it, fell in love with it. I
simply had to send it. Keep and
cherish it as it is about 200 years
old. At that time the English used
it for salt. They haven’t changed
a bit in that they still use it for
the same. Let’s put it on the ta-
ble and use it the first time we are
back together.” (Signed) Ernie.

The salt dish holds a place of
honor in her third floor apartment
at 522 Ivy Street, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. She calls her apart-

a change from the quarters that,

Committee To Plan

Religious Events

Religious activities committee of
the University this year plans to
offer students an expanded pro-
gram of religious services, featur-
ing special music by the Heinz
chapel choir, led each week by a
different student. Last year’s
weekly 15-minute programs will
be replaced this year by a half-
hour service each week in which
the Heinz choir will participate
for the first time. At this week’s
service, at 1 o’clock Friday, to be
led by Jean Swope, Ed, president
of the YWCA, the choir will sing
'‘‘God So Loved the World.”

Dr. Farmer, chaplain of the
Heinz chapel, will present a series
of talks which he describes as

University Offers
Aviation Geog. .

A new course in aviation geo-
graphy, an outgrowth of Pitt’s
work with the Army Air corps
and part of a new program which
allows students to take aviation
as a major subject, is being given
at the University this fall.

Aviation geography deals with
making and interpreting maps of
all parts of the world. It deals
with physical geography from the
i standpoint of barriers to air routes,

and weather and climate from the
I standpoint of the pilot in the cock-
E pit. The climate of regions where

l
;to travel, such as the route over

ithe North pole, and the climate
I crossed in ﬂying it is also studied.
