You can get an Introduction to Art text-
book at the University Bookstore for
$72.20, or you can walk a few blocks to

independently-owned Campus

" almost always cheaper than the
University’s. That’s because their
inventory is mostly comprised of
used textbooks, according to store
owner Mike 
Students could save a lot
of money by braving the bitter
winds of Forbes Avenue and buy-
ing their textbooks at his store.

 Costs stack up as fast as the books. Are
 used books a solution or another problem?

By selling used books at a cheaper rate
than the University, Chizmar does a lot of
business in a hurry. This year was unusual,
but he usually runs out of a lot of his stock
by the ﬁrst week.

“We keep expanding,” he said. “This
year we had more orders than last year, and
I think we’ll keep growing.”

Though the University store doesn’t
carry many used books, they keep most of
the required texts on the shelf until the rnid—
dle of the term, according to store director
Rosemarie Slezak.

The number of used books for sale and
the number of books in stock is the main dif-
ference between the two stores.

Buying used books is always easier on
a student’s pocketbook, but Slezak said used
books may put students at a disadvantage
sometimes.

For example, the new Introduction to
Art book comes in a shrink-wrapped pack-
age with a guide to looking for art on the
intemet and a small writer’s guide.

Because Chizmar mostly buys used
books, Slezak said he doesn’t get many of

Six escaped convicts still on the loose after local jailbreak

‘Marc Nuzzo

 

State and local law enforcement offi-
cials continue to search for fugitives five
days after six inmates tunneled their way
to freedom from the State Correctional
Institution at Pittsburgh.

On the run are convicted murderers
George Conard, 66, and Carmen Keller,

36. They escaped along with Nuno '

Pontes, 30, convicted of escape, burglary,

and criminal conspiracy; Leslie
Billingsley, 30, convicted on charges of

robbery, criminal conspiracy, and aggra-
lvated assault; Andrew Heim, 26, convict-
ed of criminal attempt and possession of

instruments of crime; and Thomas
Berkelbaugh, 48, convicted of robbery.

' Sometime between a 6:30 a.m. head
count and another at 10 a.m., the six men
crawled through a 70-foot shaft that they
had dug from the prison’s laundry to an
lgunsecured warehouse outside the prison
§;wal1. From the warehouse, they simply
friwalked out a door to freedom.

Marc Nuzzo/Staff Writer

This watchtower looks formidable - so the six prisoners walked out a warehouse door.

The escapees constructed the tunnel
while on work details, which were often
unsupervised.

T‘wo inmates worked» in Building 28,
which houses the prison laundry,
machine shop, and engineer’s office. It
was from the engineer’s office that the

prisoners obtained a key to an access
door in the machine shop. _

Once past the access door, they
worked in a crawlspace that housed
phone wires and heating pipes, tunneling
towards freedom with a stolen prison
blueprint as their guide.

Prison officials said that the burrow-
ing the tunnel took an extended period of
time, but none of the prisoners were
noted missing from their job duties for
any unusual amount of time.

The inmates used various power
tools, including a power saw and a jack-
hamrner drill, to dig the tunnel through
the sandy soil. They used an extension
cord in the -‘narrow tunnel to operate the
machinery.

Tim Collins, the public information

officer at SCI Pittsburgh, said the tunnel .

ran from the machine shop’s crawlspace
area towards the wall for 10 feet, down
approximately 15 feet, and horizontally
under the prison wall for about 30 more
feet.

The tunnel then rose vertically for 15
feet into the outside warehouse, where
the prisoners had to break through the
six—inch concrete ﬂoor with a hydraulic
jack.

The tunnel’s diameter ranged from
three feet to “areas narrowed to a size

29 deaths in Michigan crash

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON, D.C. His
attempt to leave the U.S. last week
may have been thwarted by U.S.
officials, but the Georgian diplomat
who was involved in the car wreck
that left a 16-year-old girl dead in
Washington D.C. is now being kept
in the United States by his own

country.
Republic of Georgia President
Eduard Shevardnadze ordered

Saturday that Gueorgui Makharadze
remain in the United States until the
investigation into the girl’s death is
complete. This change of heart came
after public outcry over a letter in
which Shevardnadze recalled the

diplomat after the U.S. State
Department had asked Georgia to
waive diplomatic immunity.

Makharadze faces charges ranging
from negligent homicide to second-
degrec murder. Charges could be
filed as early as this week. —-

Officials criticize prison procedures

Marc Nuzzo

:-:«. .-:-.:?:

After Wednesday’s prison break at
the State Correctional Institute at
Pittsburgh, officials have blown the
whistle on the prison’s administration
for waiting to sound the alarm.

The break, which occurred some-
time between 6 and 10 a.m., was not
reported to Pittsburgh police or other
local law enforcement agencies for
nearly 4 1/2 hours.

Mayor Tom Murphy, at a Friday
press conference, stated his concern
and frustration at prison authorities
who delayed notifying Pittsburgh city
police of the six prisoners’ escape.

Murphy said that when Police
Chief Robert W. McNeilly was noti-
fied, city police had already been

- unknowingly placed in danger.

“What if our police had stopped
the car with the six dangerous fugi-
tives without knowing it?” asked
Murphy.

Concern has echoed all through
city law enforcement agencies, even
through Pitt’s own police department.

 

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said
that the campus police did receive an
all—points bulletin describing the pris-
oners at the same time most local law
enforcement agencies did.

The all-points bulletin was issued
sometime in the mid— to late after-
noon, said sources from Pennsylvania
State Police based in Findlay
Township.

Boyd said that by the time
University police received the bul-
letin, the suspects “had most likely put
as many miles as possible between
themselves and the city of Pittsburgh.”

State Rep. Don Walko proposed a
resolution to investigate the prison’s
security practices and policies.

In an interview with The Pitt
News, Walko said the delayed notifi-
cation of city police was “silly” and
that “all people in the city of
Pittsburgh were put at risk.”

Murphy said on Friday that he had
spoken .with prison superintendent
Greg White and was assured prompt

notification of local police depart-

ments would be standard procedure in
the future.

Break

that a person could barely ﬁt through,”
according to Collins. As prison officials
inspected the tunnel Wednesday after-
noon, it had already begun to collapse.

Once outside, the escapees changed
into civilian clothes and walked along
Beaver Avenue, which runs along the
front of the prison.

The prisoners are not thought to
have been helped‘ in their escape.
According to prison sources, inmates are
permitted to wear civilian clothes after
certain hours.

By the time prison officials discov-
ered the tunnel’s exit, all that was left
outside the hole was a mound of the pris-
oners’ clothes and some dirt from the
tunnel.

Though state troopers began the
search almost immediately, Pittsburgh
city police were not notiﬁed until 4 1/2
hours after the manhunt began, when
canine units were called to the prison.

Mayor Tom Murphy, disgusted at
the prison authority’s poor notification,
criticized prison officials at a Friday
news conference.

Murphy said Pittsburgh police could

 

have confronted the escapees and were
“unnecessarily” put in a dangerous situa-
tion.

State Rep. Don Walko agreed that
the communication procedures used
were deplorable.

In an interview with The Pitt News,
Walko voiced concern, saying that “the
safety of local residents must remain a
top priority.”

“It’s silly not to first notify the city
police,” Walko said.

Walko was outraged that most of the
community surrounding the SCI at
Pittsburgh had to discover the escape on
the evening news, almost seven hours
after residents were placed in danger.

“All people in the city of Pittsburgh
were put at risk,” said Walko. “Why was-
n’t the community notiﬁed more prompt-
ly and in an organized manner?”

Walko has introduced a resolution to
the State House in order to create a select
committee that will investigate prison
security at the SCI at Pittsburgh.

A $6000 reward is being offered for
information leading to the capture of the
six prisoners.

these package deals.

‘These [pamphlets] can be a beneﬁt to
the students,” said Slezak. “Sometimes it’s a
writing guide, other times it’s some piece of
software to help a student study. These
things come in a shrink—wrapped package
with the new books, and if that’s what the
professor orders, then that’s what we have to
sell.”

But Chizmar said these shrink-
wrapped “bonuses” are just ploys by the
publisher to guarantee new books will be
sold.

“If a certain book hasn’t had a new edi-
tion in a while, the publisher knows there are
a lot on the market, and he has to come up
with some way to sell a new book, or he
doesn’t make any money,” Chizrnar said.
“So he goes to the professor and convinces
him that these pamphlets can really help the
class, and they’re offered in this cute little
package deal at a ‘discount.”’

Chizrnar said the professor will often
order the new books and pamphlets without
changing the curriculum or considering the
cost. Often these “bonuses” go unused

“The class might never use anything but
the original text book, and they can pay
twice as much for it,” he said. “I get the orig-
inal used book and pick up a few of the pam-
phlets separately and sell them on an indi-
vidual basis to the students who want them.”

Because she knows the ﬁnancial bur-
dens many students are under, Slezak said
she’d like to carry more used books in her

store, but because it’s University-owned, she
can only purchase books speciﬁed by the
professors.

“I know what it’s like to be a poor col-
lege student,” she said. “New books are
always more expensive, but we can only buy
what the teacher says to buy.”

While many people feel the bookstore
makes a higher proﬁt from selling new
books, Slezak said they actually make more
on used books.

“If we can get all the books for a partic-
ular class at our buy-back window, it saves
us the cost of shipping them across country
from the publisher,” she said. “That cost is
reﬂected in the retail price to students.”

Because Chizrnar’s store is smaller and
privately—owned, he’s capable of buying
only the books he wants and selling them at
a cheaper price, according to Slezak. That’s
an advantage to some, but it also means he

doesn’t always have the materials for many
other classes.

“He doesn’t deal in the volume we do,”
she said. “He doesn’t sell graduate course
materials, for example. You can probably get
what you need at his store for your freshman
and sophomore years, but as you get into the
more speciﬁed classes, o11r competitor just
doesn’t carry the books for those classes.”

Slezak said Chizmar’s low prices are
the result of her store doing most of his “leg-
work”

“We collect the book lists and class
sizes from the different departments and
make xeroxed copies for [Chizmar],” she
said. “His overhead is much lower than ours,
and that’s why he can sell at a cheaper
price.”

But Chizrnar said the University doesn’t
do him any “favors.”

“I pay for that list,” he said. “They don’t
just give me that list out of the goodness of
their hearts.”

Though Chizrnar carries books for most
undergraduate courses, he doesn’t have
them all, but said he will gladly order books
for students if he doesn’t have what they
need.

But some students can’t wait the three to
four days it takes for a delivery, and Chizrnar

 FROM PAGE I "

said he often must tell them they’d be better
olf getting them at his competitor’s store.

“I do what I can to help the students,” he
said. ‘That way if I can’t help them now, I
hope tlrey’ll remember me the next time
they need something.”

Because Chizrr1ar’s store canies used
books, and the University store carries most-
ly new copies, Slezak said comparing the
two stores is like “comparing apples to
oranges.”

The difference in cost of both new and
used books at both stores is usually only two
or three dollars.

“It’s not that much of a diiference, but I
will always undersell my competitor,”
Chizrnar said. “IfI ever ﬁnd out they’re sell-
ing a book cheaper than we are, I’ll at least
match that cost”

Cost is always the beneﬁt of buying
used books, but availability is deﬁnitely one
of its downsides. Both Chizrnar and Slezak
agree the only way for students to ﬁnd a bar-
gain is to be infonned shoppers and check
the prices on their books before they buy
them.

“Competition always beneﬁts the con-
sumer,” Chizrnar said “Students just have to
be aware that they have options and can look
for the best price.”

- of a book that makes it absolutely necessary to have it rather than

As any student can tell you, books are overpriced. Not only
are you supposed to have the means to pay tuition, but you are
also expected to pay hundreds of dollars a semester for text-
books.

We would like to impart to you a little advice about how to
keep the costs of books down and more money in your pocket.

1. Professors should research the costs of the bools they
assign for their classes. We thank those professors who already
do this and encourage others to follow their example. Some
things to look into would be: Is there anything in the ﬁfth edition

the fourth edition? Is the book you are assigning the cheapest
book which covers the material you wish to cover? Are there
used copies of the book available?

2. Instead of selling your books from the previous semester
back to the bookstore, why not sell them to other students? You
can sell them for what you would have gotten for them by sell-
ing them to the bookstore —- or even more — while still selling
them for cheaper than the bookstore would sell the same used
book.

3. If you do choose to sell your books back to the bookstore,
demand that you are paid half of the price that the book costs
new. It is the bookstore’s policy to pay half price on all of the
books that it buys back. If you are not getting half price, you are
getting ripped off.

4. Never buy a used book that costs more than 75 percent of
what the book costs new. If you pay more than 75 percent, you
are once again getting ripped off, as this is also a supposed “pol-
icy” of the bookstore.

5. If a course you are taking requires you to buy a packet of
photocopies, ﬁnd some other people in the class with whom you
can split the cost and buy it together. Then, you can each make
a photocopy of the packet at a fraction of what it originally cost.

6. Last, but not least, you must refuse to buy books that are
overpriced. Voice your complaint to the professor about the out-
rageous price of the books for the course, and take advantage of
the books on reserve at the various libraries throughout campus
as well as checking the Carnegie Library to see if they carry the
book. It might be a bit of an inconvenience, but it’s free.

As we return from our

. must admit that most of it was

much more interesting than
spending 50 minutes in a stuffy
Cathedral classroom watching
the clouds roll by the window.

So, what did I do with
myself when I wasn’t keeping
up with my classes and letting
my grades slide? As this was the
first time I had ever lived away
from home, I was exploring the
boundaries of my freedom and
of myself. I had to learn how to
be self—sufﬁcient and how to
define myself as a person out-
side of the familial unit and
friends that I had been around
my entire life. I had to learn
what I wanted to get out of life
and how I could attain it without
losing touch with who I am. Yes,
in learning about those things
which I hope will guide me
throughout my life, learning
about such things as logic and
psychology fell to the wayside,
leaving my transcript a desolate
mess.

This is not to say that I con-
sidered all of my classes to be a
waste of time. There were those

classes that I greatly enjoyed
and excelled in because of the
fact that I found them interest-
ing. If I didn’t come here to
learn about more than just how
to live life, then I could have
saved my time and money by
foregoing the college experi-
ence and joining the working
sector of our society. However, I

wanted to have the college!

experience. I just found the most
interesting and educational parts
of that experience to be mainly
outside of the classroom.

What I now need to figure
out is what being a student at the
University of Pittsburgh has
done for me. I also need to show
that to those people who will be
judging what I’ve accom-
plished, as I try to either further
my education or join the real
world of the working class. How
do I show all the things I learned
through an internship and what
effects they had on me? The
Institute of Politics here at this
university afforded me the
opportunity to intern with State
Rep. Don Walko. This was an
experience that I found to be
among the most rewarding of
my academic career. I got to
learn about politics while actu-
ally participating in them, rather
than sitting in a too-hard chair
listening to a professor drone on
from a lectem.

This is a problem in_higher
education that is not addressed.
Even though the material in a
class may be interesting, it is
hard to sit day after day and sim-
ply listen to information being
imparted in lecture format. To
actually go out and see how
those things I’d conceptually
learned in class worked or didn’t
work in practice taught me more
than the combination of all of
the classes I had previously
taken. It was an experience I
could become excited about,
and one in which I not only

wanted to partake, but also
wanted to share with my friends.
I found myself discussing my

internship ad infinitum with '

them.

When it was over, I didn’t
want it to end, and thanks to
Rep. Walko, I was able to stay
on for an extra semester. I also
got the opportunity to work in
Harrisburg as a legislative assis-
tant this summer because of my
internship. The experiences I
had working here in Pittsburgh
and in Hanisburg gave me a
practical knowledge that I could
never have acquired in the class-
room.

Another aspect of my edu-
cation at Pitt was the experience
of living in Pittsburgh. Coming
from small-town DuBois (which
is here in Pennsylvania and not
in Idaho as some think), living
in a city afforded a whole new
range of activities and options to
be explored. Much of my fresh-
man year was spent hopping on
buses just to ﬁnd out where they
went and what was along the
way. To‘ this day, one of my
favorite activities is to take the
incline to Mt. Washington and
look out over the city all lit up at
night. It is a view that anyone
who has ever been to Pittsburgh
should see. After spending the
daily grind being bombarded by
panhandlers and other assorted
trials of city life, it is impressive
to see how clean and bright the
city can look.

These are among the things
which I will take with me from
my stay here at the University of
Pittsburgh, and sadly, with the
exception of the fact that I actu-
ally was an intern, none of it
will ever show up on my tran-
script, nor is any of it reﬂected
in my QPA. God, I hope those
aren’t the only things people
look at.

Why not us?
That’s the question surrounding this
year’s Pitt basketball season. Two

weeks into the conference season, Pitt is
arguably the hottest team in the Big
East. Granted, they might not be the best
team or even one of the top few teams,
but they are 8-2 in their last 10 games
after a 1-4 start.

Discouraging losses to Navy and
Virginia Commonwealth put a dark, cast
over the beginning of the season. But
the Panthers have rebounded from early

season embarrassments to begin to look
like a solid team. The return of Chad
Varga and Gerald Jordan from injuries
have meant a lot to a team that desper-
ately needed inside muscle. Pitt looks
like they won’t get pushed around
inside, a problem earlier in the season.
With Varga, Jordan, freshman Isaac
Hawkins, and Mark Blount (when he

The Pitt Panthers avenged
two powerful last—second losses to
Rutgers last year, as they defeated
the Scarlet Knights 75-67 at a
packed Fitzgerald Field House.
The Panthers led the entire game
but needed clutch shooting late in
the game to ﬁnish off the Knights.

The Panther victory was
number eight in the last 10 games,
improving the Panther record to
9-7. More importantly, the win
pushed the Panthers’ Big East
Conference record to 3-2. With
Villanova and Georgetown losing
conference games this week, the
Panthers are right in the thick of
things.

“I think a lot of people use the
word ‘parity’ [in the Big East].
But it’s early.” Rutgers Coach
Bob Wenzel said following the
game. “I’ve got to give [Pitt] cred-
it. They are playing well.”

Leading the Panther attack
was forward Jason Maile who

: poured in 24 points and six three-

pointers. Following a 22-point
performance against Miami and a
successful Rainbow Classic in
which he shot 16 for 21 from

three-point territory (.762), Maile
has found his shot.

“Ever since Hawaii, I feel
conﬁdent.” Maile said.

Pitt dominated the Scarlet
Knights in the first half. Rutgers’
sloppy play and the Panthers’
stingy defense threatened to bury
the Scarlet Knights. After Maile’s
first three-pointer at 13:34, Pitt
jumped out to a 16-9 lead.

Pitt’s inside game received a
boost from Isaac Hawkins and
center Gerald Jordan, who
knocked in 17 points and 10
rebounds. Head Coach Ralph
Willard praised both players fol-
lowing the game, calling it
J ordan’s best game of the year.

Hawkins follow of a Kellii
Taylor miss with a rim-rattling
put—back jam pushed the Panther
lead to 26-13. The Panthers con-
tinued their aggressive defensive
play, with Vonteego Cummings
controlling the offense as Maile
buried an NBA three-pointer to
give the Panthers their largest lead
of the game, 35-19. Two late
threes by Rutgers cut the Panther
lead at halftime to 39-28.

The Panther defense that sti-
ﬂed Rutgers in the first half came
out lethargic in the second half.

I the stretch, we found a way to win

“We followed the game plan
to a ‘T’ in the first half.” Willard
said. “Then we came out ﬂat [in
the second half]. We seem not to
handle leads well  We were ten-
tative.”

Forward Terry Mills led the
Rutgers charge in the second half,
scoring 19 of his team—high 22
points in the second half. Fueled
by Mills’ and guard Geoff Billet’s
hot shooting, the Scarlet Knights
clawed their way back into the
game. Following Mills’ fourth
three-pointer and forward Rob
Hodgson’s two free—throws,
Rutgers cut the Panther lead to
only three at 65-62 with only 4:11
remaining.

Gerald Jordan’s put-back off
a Cummings miss and Maile’s
sixth trey brought the Fitzgerald
Fanatics to their feet, as Pitt
lengthened the lead to eight with
1:38 left in the game. Clutch free-
throws by Maile and Jordan in the
ﬁnal 0:33 finished the Scarlet
Knights and erased any hope of
another fantastic ﬁnish versus the
Panthers.

“Despite a lack of poise down

at the end of the game,” Willard
said.

Pitt’s women’s basketball team
dropped its second in a row yesterday to
Syracuse. The Lady Panthers committed
30 turnovers in the 78-70 defeat.

Pitt made a strong showing at the
opening of the game, dominating play
despite limited scoring. They managed
only a 2-0 lead, but kept Syracuse at bay
for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes. After this, the
Orangewomen took control.

Syracuse extended their lead to 11
with 3:57 remaining by implementing
their full-court press. This tenacious pres-
sure put the Lady Panthers back on their
heels and took them out of their mental

rhythm.

“The decision-making was not good,”
said Head Coach Kirk Bruce. It was the
only reason he gave for his team’s lack of
success.

“We weren’t getting open,” said junior
guard JoJo Guzman. “I felt like I was just
standing around not getting open. It was
just helter-skelter [out] there.”

After they broke the press, the Lady
Panthers stole the momentum going into
the locker room. They cut the Syracuse
lead to two points. Michelle Katkowski
pumped in ﬁve points during the late run.

The Panthers went into the locker
room with the momentum, but they mis-
placed it on the way back to the ﬂoor. In
the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of the second half,
Syracuse ran the lead to 14.

“We came roaring back to get it with-

Syracuse beats Lady Panthers, Montesano still out

in two, and then we had a letdown and had
to fightback again,” said Bruce. “It’s hard
to keep ﬁghting like that.”

“We need the desire to go out and
win,” added Guzman. “We came out ﬂat.”

The Orangewomen never looked back
and captured the victory to raise them to 4-
10 overall, with a 2-4 record in the Big
East. The Lady Panthers dropped to 7-10
overall, with a 2-4 record in the Big East.

Pitt had problems with Syracuse’s
half-court defense, in addition to their
press. Trying to rush past the Orange
defense, the Lady Panthers made passes
without looking or passed to a player who
was covered.

“We tried to overdo it and make some
plays that weren’t there,” said Bruce,

Football

0 Thanks to a 30-13 victory over the
Carolina Panthers in Sunday’s NFC
Championship, the Green Bay Packers
return to the Super Bowl for the first
time in thirty years. Brett Favre and
Dorsey Blevins led the Packer charge
against a Panther defense that had aver-
aged less than two touchdowns allowed
per game.

0 Joining the Packers in New
Orleans will be the New England
Patriots, who ended the Jacksonville
Jaguars’ two—garne upset streak with a
20-6 victory in the AFC Championship
game. The contest was delayed in the
second quarter by a power outage that
darkened a number of stadium lights; it
was the only stoppage that didn’t
involve the Patriots’ defense, which has
allowed just nine points so far in the
playoffs.

Golf
- Emerging superstar and walking

ad campaign Tiger Woods took the
Mercedes Championships on Sunday
with a birdie on the first playoff hole.
Woods received $216,000 for his 14-
under-par performance.

- Before there was Tiger, Arnold
Palmer was the recognized celebrity of
the links. It was released this weekend
that the 67-year-old from nearby
Latrobe is suffering from prostate can-
cer. Palmer’s last tour win came in
1973, but his collection of followers,
dubbed Amie’s Army, continue to clog
courses.

Hockey

0 AMERITECH has reportedly
thrown their name into the hat of those
interested in bringing professional
hockey to Colombus, Ohio. During
meetings Monday and Tuesday in New
York, NHL officials armounced plans
for expansion. No timetable has been
released; however, reports have stated
that there could be new teams as early
as 1998. Those teams will have to come
up with at least $75 million up front.

There will be a sports writers’ meeting on Tuesday
at 5 p.m. New writers welcome. Old writers
encouraged to attend. Strongly.

returns from a wrist injury in a week
or so), Pitt has a solid frontcourt that
should be able to battle in the Big
East.

Speaking of the Big East, it looks
like there won’t be a clear—cut power-
house in the conference. Take a look
at some perennial favorites:

Villanova looked strong early —
until, that is, they got blitzed by
Providence last week.

Georgetown has been inconsis-
tent, but still throttled their tradition-
al early season patsies. Then, they
lost to Miami yesterday.

Syracuse has looked weary from
their Final Four run last year and
clearly doesn’t have the dogs they did
last year. John Wallace is sorely
missed.

Boston College has been the only
consistent team in the conference.
Even so, they have yet to establish
themselves as a Big East presence.

So Pitt, coming off two Big East
wins in a row, appears to at least be
able to stay competitive in the league.
A revenge win‘ against St. John’s on
Saturday will go a long way in show-
ing Pitt’s legitimacy.

Hey, if Jacksonville and Carolina
can make it to the conference cham-
pionship in football, who’s to say that
Pitt can’t make a run in the Big East?

Pitt News.

whose squad has dropped six of eight at
home this season. “We cannot ﬁnd the
secret to winning at home. Some games
we play good, and others we piddle
around.”

Pitt tried to pound the ball inside all
night. Without injured sophomore guard
Gina Montesano, Bruce felt that the
team’s strength was primarily underneath,
and he designed the offense accordingly.
He was rewarded with big games from
Latia Howard and Missy Thompson.

Howard led the Lady Panthers in
scoring with 19, as teammate Thompson
racked up 17. Teakyta Barnes paced

Syracuse with 19, and Paula Moore fol- A

lowed with 17.

The Lady Panthers also dropped their
Thursday night game at Georgetown. The
Hoyas outscored Pitt 15-8 in overtime to
come away with the 74-67 victory.

Thompson led the way for Pitt with
14 points. Melba Chambers led the Lady
Hoyas with 15.

The score was dead even at the half,
with both teams tied at 20. Things stayed
even throughout the second as it ended 59-
59. Georgetown pounded Pitt in the extra
period to raise their Big East record to 3-2.

Montesano missed both of the games
with a knee injury sustained Jan. 6 against
Miami. She hopes to return for one of the
two road games this week.

Pitt travels to Boston College on
Wednesday and Notre Dame Saturday
before returning home to face Providence
on January 22.

‘A Catholic Anthropology for Our Times”

 

Mark Gruber, 0513., Ph.D.
Associate Professor of Anthropology

St. Vincent College

Friday, Janua
7:30 RM. to
at the Oratory,

Christian anthropology has traditionally
neglected to formally elaborate the
significance of gender to the creative and
redemptive work of God. Since the
Industrial Age, a decidedly masculinized
outlook has marginalized the value of the
distinctly feminine. Now is the time to
recover the Church's intuition of the
relations between men and "women,

a meaning which transcends politics and
reveals something of the very nature
of the Godhead.
