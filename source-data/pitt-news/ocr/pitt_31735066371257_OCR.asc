Organization
works for world
understanding  

By Jill Devlne
The Pitt News

ln l96l, President Kennedy created
an organization chartered to “pro-
mote understanding between different ,
countries.” With this~the Peace Corps
was launched.

Robin Jones, coordinator of Pitts’s
urban studies program and Pitt soci-
ology professor Daniel -Regan are
veteran Peace Corps volunteers. Both
volunteered for the Peace.Corps dur-
ing the 19605. ‘

Jones was a member of a training
group headed for the British Hondu-
ras (now Belize), but because of politi-
"cal problems with the group, about 70
percent of them were “deselected,” she
said. i P

During the l960‘s, one out of five
applicants was accepted to go through
training, Jones said. -

“After that, they’d observe you for a
number of reasons. In those days, [the
Peace Corps] didn't want people who
had any type of political involvement.
The Vietnam War was going on then.
You could say nothing against the
United States or the war. You were
insturcted not tosay anything about
American foreign policy when you
were in [the host] country." '

Jones said that Peace Corps train-
ers ‘carefully avoided people who
might embarrass the .American
government because of their views.

“If they thought you were going to
be a risk, they ‘deselected’ you. They ,
sent you home."

Normally, in a training group of
about 60 people, only about five peo-
ple were deselected, usually for pretty
valid reasons, she said.

In Jones’ case, her training group
was being sent to a place that had a
very large black population, and her
group ‘consisted entirely of whites.
The Washington liaison between the
Peace Corps office in Washington and
Jones’ training group had concerns
about sending an all-white training
group into Belize, said Jones, so her
training group was sent home.

Inside, Today

SGB, students

await teacher

evaluation info

By Karen Dobrzynski
The Pitt News

Report recommendations calling for
mandatory teaching evaluations and g the
release of supplementary evaluation data to
student government have never been imple-
mented, according to academic affairs chair-
man Bill Davis.

, Pitt Provost Roger Benjamin said -it is up
to each individual department to decide
whether teaching evaluations should be con-
ducted. He added that evaluations are not
mandatory because the resources of the
Office for the Evaluation of Teaching(OET)

are limited.

“Every dollar put into the support services
is a dollar away from the classrooms," Ben-
jamin said. A

This is no excuse, according to Davis, who
said, “The resource problem is a bunch of
bullshit." The administration‘, he said,‘ will
fund what it feels is important.

Student government has been working
with the Provost‘s Office and OET since its
formation, and nothing has changed, Davis

. said. “There is no standard policy in the

College of Arts and ‘Sciences administration
and faculty to do anything, and it.i-s my
feeling that doing nothing hasbeen the gen-
eral attitude," he said. A

OET was formed in I977 by former Pitt , I

provost Rhoten Smith, who was charged to
carry out the report's recommendations.

Davis oversees the ‘Academic Affairs
Committee-Review of Course Evaluations, a
book of student evaluation results. Onlya
small percentage of the results are published
because OET promises confidentiality to all
instructors who permit an evaluation to be
conducted.

Of those instructors evaluated last semes-
ter., 26 percent signed and mailed a waiver of
consent, according to Davis. He added this
does not mean the other instructors refused
to release results; some may have forgotten.

Beyond their importance to students, eva-
luations areiiecessary for university person-
nel decisions. According to the report of the
Committee on the Evaluation of Teaching,
“administrative action to effect a promotion
or the award of tenure will not be approved
for faculty who have teaching responsibili-
ties_unless the record includes a complete
evaluation of teaching.” ,

In order to provide students with ade-
quate information on courses, the report
requires a supplementary section of the sur-

vey, but not the main part, to be “made

available automatically to the student
government to publish if they wish.”
Because faculty are required to have at least
one course per year evaluated, the report
says this information could “add signifi-
cantly to the information -already available
to students in their course selection." A
Sarah Strouss of OET said an automatic
release of the data is not in the best interest
of the office because it could lose its credibil-
ity with faculty. Davis, however, said the
procedure could be changed to allow evalua-
tions to be published unless individual
faculty members indicate otherwise.

by Pulitzer-Prize winning poet
Maxine Kumin and editors from
national ‘magazines, including
Esquire, Essence and The Washing-
ton Journalism Review at the

A series of panels, workshops, lec-

department. The conference was dis-
continued for six years due to
budget constraints but was restarted
in 1982.

This year’s conference will include
film for the first time. Robert Ward,
author and screenwriter, will appear
at a special screening of his film,
“Cattle Annie and Little Britches,”

which will open the conference on ,

Friday, March 16, in the Multi-
Purpose Room of the William Pitt
Union.

Lewis “Buddy” Nordan, an assis-
tant professor of English at Pitt,
thinks the conference will benefit
students.

“There is just something about
hanging out with writers when you
are trying to become a writer your-

“self,” Nordan said. “Its helpful to

know that you have got the same
problems and same joys as someone

Si Kahn visits Oakland

Singer doubles as social critic

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

Political activists are still alive
and singing. Si Kahn and Cathy
Fink mixed playing music with pol-
iticking at a fundraiser last Saturday
night-for the National Toxics cam~
paign at Carlow College.

Between l(ahn’s mellow guitar
and Fink’s feisty banjo, the duo per-
formed a rich evening of 26 songs.

They sang tributes to workers and
women, and some anti—war ballads.
But they also sang of love and
friendship and growing old.

“Politics and music do not have to
be separated by an appendectomy,”
Kahn said. “We do it all at once.”
But he said he does not believe in
preaching to the audiences.

“If people have fun here tonight,
they’ll leave feeling good about the
Natioal Toxics campaign, and feel-
ing good about our issues," he said.

i The National Toxics campign is a
broad coalition of citizens’ groups
that support legislation to inform
the public of toxic substances in the
workplace and in the community.
Kahn, a Harvard graduate, was
born and raised in State College, Pa.
His songs are a commentary. He
sings about his grandfather’simmi-
gration from Russia to America in
the song_‘_‘Crossing the Border” and
he condemns the Russian invasion
in the song “Children of Poland.”

“We’ve got government on horse-
back again," he sang. “Back to the
days when congressmen were men.
We’re running on testosterone
again.”

  

i Kahn

ln his work as an organizer Kahn .

has fought against such giants as the
J.P. Stevens Co. One ballad,
“Aragon Mill” focuses on the clos-
ing of a cotton mill.

Living room music is what Fink
called their eclectic blend of tradi-
.tional and contemporary folk,
country-western, and southern
songs. “People ‘used to play in their
living rooms about love and work,
about the things that happened to
them in their daily lives," she said.

“We’ve just taken it out of the living

room.”

Kahn said since he and Fink are
working on seven or eight different
issues at once, his main ambition is

 

“longevity" so he can keep up the
fight. 0

Kahn and Fink urged the
audience to register to vote with one
of the volunteers that walked up and
down the auditorium aisles. The
media has created the “illusion that
young people today are only inter-
ested in their careers and in buying
condos,” Kahn said later. “During
the next six to eight months you’ll
see as many people out there knock-
ing on doors as ever,” he said.

Kahn and Fink agreed they would
like to see President. Reagan
defeated in the next election.

“Reagan is my candidate for early
retirment. He should be sentences to
spend seven years as a clerical
worker,” Kahn said.

Day at the ‘Races  

Aaaannnd, their off!

Coming through the first turn its Walter Mondale by two
lengths, followed by John Glenn who is being closely chased
through the back stretch by Alan Cranston and Jesse Jackson.

lt’s primary time and once again television coverage of the

- event sounds more like a horse race than one of the most

important developments in American politics. The television
news media don’t generally explain the positions ofthe candi-
dates on issues as they explain their positions in the race.

The American President is one of the most powerful and
inﬂuential people in the world. In November, Americans,
albeit an unfortunate minority of those elligable, will vote that
person into office. ' I ‘

The ridiculously inﬂated coverage of Monday’s Iowan cau-
cus and next week’s New Hampshire primary stands as an
example of the auctioneer—style reporting by an otherwise cap-p
able news service. To single out Iowa or New Hampshire as
indicative Democratic states is both false and misleading to the
voters in other states with later primaries.

Iowa has about a one percent black population, New Hamp-
shire has even less than that. The U. S-IS appmxlmatel)’ 1-7-

’ percent black and the Democratic party is one fourth black.

One could hardly make an argument that these states are

representative of America or it’s Democratic voters, yet poll— ,
' sters and news reporters would have you think otherwise.

' If voters are influenced by the success ofa candidate in Iowa
or New-Hampshire and not his position on issues, the magnifi-
cation of these early primaries only serves to strengthen the
campaign of whoever is ahead in February or March. Afterall,
the personpelected in November will be negotiating with the
Soviets, planning the economics of our country, and inﬂuenc-
ing our laws. To choose this individual on the news reportsof
voting patterns of Midwest farmers is sheer lunacy.

The news services owe the public more than just a play—by-
play. If the networks can’t do any better, than they ought to
replace Dan Rather and_Peter Jennings with Don Meridith and
John Madden. ~

A Separate Law

Pittsburgh City Controller Tom Flaherty has called for the
city to break its ties with the law firm Baskin and Sears —
which also represents the apartheid government of South
Africa.

This -is a proper and important step in showing that Pitts-
burgh is opposed to prejudice and will not assist agents or
accomplices to institutions of discrimination.

However, the city’s lack of action on the controller’s reco-

' mendations is unfortunate. The city council seems split on

whether-to stand up on this moral issue or to brush it aside
because of power the law firm can wield.

Earlier, Mayor Caliguiri had denounced the South African
government in his opposition to the opening ofa South African
consulate in Pittsburgh. One would expect a man who called

South Africa’s apartheidtsystem “immoral and outrageuos,”to V

immediately sever his association with a supporter of that
government. As of last week it appeared the mayor would
continue to deal with the law firm.

Council finance chairman Ben Woods said he couldn’t con-
demn Baskin and Sears because, “they do good work.” This
utilitarian view shows a total disregard for human compassion
and a preoccupation with numbers, figures and financial
ledgers.

Before reactionaries begin a headhunt against the mayor or
the lawyers at Baskin and Sears, the people of this city and
country should realize there is more than one hypocrite in the
South African contrnvercv.

Americans also seem to have a love of diamond jewelry, most
notably engagement rings, and most of these diamonds come
from South Africa. When condemning the mayor of Baskin
and Sears, make sure that that little symbol of love twinkling
on your finger isn’t marred by the sufferings of South African

America ,
support the

union label

The Kroger Company’s decision
to sell its 45 Pittsburgh area stores.
throwing another 2,800 employees
into the unemployment lines, was
the occasion for The Pitt News to
launch a- Feb. I5 editorial, blaming
workers .and their unions for this
event. The editorial is full of errors
and detracts from the overall
improvement in the quality of The
Pitt News in the last year.

You state that “the unacceptable
conditions that lead to the unioniza-
tion of America are now no longer

the norm." I suppose it depends on-

what you mean by unacceptable.
For millions of unorganized
workers today, the minimum wage.
split shifts, speed-up. unemploy-
ment. health hazards. discrimina-
tion and a general lack of respect for
their dignity are the rule.

If you don‘t believe me. just walk
around Oakland and ask a bank

worker at a major university. Only ‘

unionization will give these workers
the collective strength they need to
improve their jobs.

You notethat non-union workers
received higher raises last year than
did unionized. All this proves is that
the recession hit manufacturing and
construction hard. The only valid
comparison would be to contrast
similar types of workers in compara-
bly sized and situated firms. There
you will find that organized workers
do better year in and year out. And
that doesn't count such additional
benefits as a grievance procedure.
seniority. better fringe benefits. etc.

You argue ‘that give-backs by
workers save jobs. The fact is'that
concessions usually do just the

opposite. The best local example is .
‘in the grocery business itself. Kroger

is now screaming that it can’t live
without the same wage concessions
that the Giant Eagle workers gave
up when their company screamed it
needed them to compete with
Kroger. No doubt, Giant Eagle and

‘ Foodland will now demand further

cuts to compete with the minimum
wage that those who buy the Kroger
stores will try to put over. Further-
more. the reduction in purchasing
power of workers who give back
money to corporations ripples
through the economy in smaller pur-
chases of goods. causing more
layoffs.

There are serious problems con-
fronting the labor movement today.
some of them of their own making.
The support ofthe top leadership of
the AFL-CIO for the huge military
buildup that helps prop up right-
wing, anti-union. low-wage para-

. dises like El Salvador. South Korea

and South Africa comes to mind.
Instead of thoughtfully confronting

Not all women
support NOW

In your Feb. I3 issue. Michael
Weinman made a few remarks that
invite a response. In the past year or
so. I know ofa number ofletters sent
in that were not published. Could it
be that The Pitt News editors. and
perhaps their advisers, did not agree
with the opinions expressed‘?

Mr.» Weinman must have had his
tongue in his check when he sug-
gested that readers are completely
satisfied with “the strict regard for
journalistic integrity" of The Pitt
News. Many of us, indeed. are not.
However. we recognize that it is a
horrendous task to get your paper
out three times a week, and there-
fore. there is always the temptation
to be less than ‘scholarly and
responsible.

A short time ago. I called your
attention to what I consider unequal
coverage of the abortion issue in
relation to featured articles. I was
told that the other side of the argu-
ment would also be presented.
Instead. Chris Clinton again gets a
big spread ~ this time on the front
page - and there have been no fea-

tured articles to present the opinions «

of those who believe the unborn
have rights that cannotjust be swept
under the carpet. Clinton might be
very surprised to find out how many
women do not support the NOW
philosophy.

In the future. can you please
include writers who give unbiased
scholarly analyses of complex prob-
lems facing our society‘? Can we hear
something about the good things
President Reagan has accomp-

lished‘? Can we hear something good

about our country‘? A university
publication should not be filled with
simplistic analyses of social issues
and propaganda.

CMU, He who
laughs last

Oh. Jeez. I just heard it again. A
group of CMU students on the bus.
One‘“asks the others. “How many
Pitt students does it take to changea
light bulb?“ The reply comes. “One.

hegets ‘three;e_redi,ts for .it.’.'~.lf .. .

there's a CMU student in the
audience you're bound to get a laugh
with that one. I

I am so tired of CMU students
making fun of Pitt. CMU is very
good inthejokes department. Look
at the front page of the Feb. I4 issue
of The Pittsburgh Press. Stories
about both universities made. the
headlines. At the top of the page it
was reported that the University of
Pittsburgh Health Center had made
history by performing the world’s
first heart/ liver transplant, saving a
little girl’s life and advancing man-
kind. Right under this article, CMU
had also made the papers with the
story of CMU student Orpheus
Allison.

This student Senate member was
impeached by his fellow students
when he turned in student leaders
for selling beer at Skibo Hall with-
out a license. At his impeachment
they drank champagne. And they
laugh at Pitt students?! No joke I
could ever think up about CMU
could be more humiliating or debas-
ing than this episode of truth.

The Press is no winner either for
putting this stuff on the front page,
with a photo no less. This story is
pure CMU; it’s self-righteous, pom-
pous and immature. Pitt has given
the world everything from world
reknowned biologists to profes-
sional athletes; from Jonas Salk to
Thomas Stazl. CMU has gotten lots
of publicity and corporate grants
and given us,...well CMU has given
us Lenny and Squiggy.

Maybe the realjoke is, who would
pay $8,400 a year to go to CMU‘?
CMU students.

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

The Democrat race reviewed

From a
thoughts:
'0 The state of Iowa is generally
known to be 90 percent" farmland
and I0 percent human population.
Therefore it‘s difficult to believe that
nearly every media big wig from var-
IOIUS political backgrounds con-
verged on Iowa for the recently con-
cluded Democratic caucuses.

What is more dumbfounding,
though, is that former vice-president
Walter Mondale is already consi-
dered a shoo-in for nomination at
this summer’s convention in San
Francisco. Based on one nominating
caucus, Mondale will face President
Reagan, provided he doesn‘t step in
front of a train between now and
November.

This myth is based on a turnout of
about 80,000 Iowans, although there
are about 70 million registered
Democrats across the nation. That
Americans are already being led to
believe a sure-fire victory for him, in
the middle of winter, is nothing new.

-Every four years, the political party
notwithstanding, the TV networks
and print publications put a vice-like
grip on early primaries and caucuses
and use the results from each to
make presumptuous conclusions.

Everyone knows these pre~Labor
Day elections are nothing more than
providing for allotments ot dele-

single cell, many

gates to state and national conven-
tions. Isn’t it time to tone down the
level of hype given winners of early
caucuses and primaries‘? Let the fair
decisions be made by the delegates
during the national conventions.

0 Democratic nominee Jesse
Jackson recently expressed his reser-
vations about the state party‘s rule
that a caucus group must represent
I5 percent of the total to elect dele-
gates to the county convention.
Jackson wants the proportional
total lowered, his rationale being
that IS percent can only be attained
by “front-runners."

No one knows Jackson‘s idea ofa
new minimum level. It is known,
though, that if you go any lower,
there is really no sound reason for
the caucus. After all, first the back-
runners or weak party nominees are
weeded out, then delegate selection
for those peaking I5 percent will
determine their support in the
national conventions.

0 An interesting thing came of ‘

George McGovern’s somewhat
impressive third—place finish behind
Mondale and Gary Hart. He sim-
ilarly placed third 12 years ago in
Iowa, “before being blown away by
Richard Nixon in the I972 general
elections. McGovern, one who says
to vote your conscience, thinks
things will turn out differently this

time around.

Why? Because he believes some
who opted for Mondale two days
ago would have instead given
McGovern the nod were it not for
Mondale currently leading the eight-
man pack. That reaches far beyond

. the depths of twisted logic.

In Brief

Times survey ﬁnds jobs

The annual Changing Timesjob survey for graduates found
some bright spots for job seekers in the midst of what is
generally characterized as a ﬂat recruiting year. The survey,
which is unique in that it seeks responses only from employer;
intending to hire graduates in the spring, uncovered more than
100 companies and government agencies with definite job
openings.

Employers with firm plans to hire graduating seniors this
year are listed in a special supplement, “I01 Companies with
Jobs for New College Grads,” inthis month’s issue of Changing
Times. About40 percent ofthe companies responding said they
plan to hire the same number of grads as they did last year, and
30 percent said they plan to hire even more. The graduates most
in demand are those with engineering degrees; 65 percent ofthe
companies reported that they need graduates in various engi-
neering specialties, ranging from electrical to aerospace and
power.

For Pitt senior Sam Huey, being
president of the Highlands School
Board, a high school basketball refe-
ree, a sports information photo-
grapher for the dean of student
activities at the Community College
of Allegheny County (CCAC) Boyce
campus, a volunteer fireman and a

makes him one busy full-time
student.

“I haven’t had a date since last
August,” said Huey.

Huey decided to run for the
school board last December. He said
the was elected president within two
minutes after being elected to the
board.

Huey, 28, is the youngest presi-
dent ever to be elected to the High-
lands School Board. “I attended
meetings for ten years, and I felt
most knowledgeable and qualified
for the position," Huey said.

Huey worked in a glass factory for
seven years to save money for col-
lege. In I980, he attended CCAC
(Boyce) and then transferred to Pitt
in I982. “I hated working in that

factory," Huey said. “It wasn’t satis-‘

fying for me.”

During his two years at Boyce,
Huey was named Male Student of
the Year in Who’s Who in Commun-
ity and Junior Colleges in 1982 on
his high academic achievement and
leadership roles and activities. He
was also president of Phi Theta
Kappa honor fraternity.

board.
“It's going to be a lot oftime, work
and negotiations until the teachers
accept our counter-proposal," Huey
said. “We hope to avoid a strike.”
Pitt economics professor Dr. Her-
bert Chesler invited Huey to lecture
to Chesler’s collective bargaining
class on his experiences of being
president of a school board. “We‘re
going to use the actual contract

proposal for study after an agree-

- ment is made,” Huey said. “It proba-

bly won’t be until next year
sometime before I’ll be able to
lecture."

Chesler said he is happy with
Huey’s accomplishment.

‘‘I’m very pleased to see the fulfill-
ment of civic responsibilities,” Dr.
Chesler said. “I have a high regard
for his interest.

s school board

“We will use his material next year
to show how contracts change over
time, Chesler explained. “Sam had
my class last term, and I feel it will
help some in his future of being pres-
ident. I also feel~he is very credible in
job market negotiations.”

- Huey said he will run for school
board president again after his term
is up. “I like being president. I like
the negotiating experience.”

Mrs. Audrey Huey, his mother,
said she is not involved in politics
and never anticipated’ her son’s
success.

‘‘I’m very proud [of his] doing it
and makingit," she said.‘  

Huey plans to become a labor
negotiator for industry upon gra-
duation in August. “I’m looking for-
ward to graduation,” Huey said,
“and I’m really anxious to go out on
a date, too."

Yugoslavia overcomes internal tensions

By Gary Hardcastle
The Pitt News ’

The media coverage of the I984
Winter Olympics has improved the
average American’s viewof what
Yugoslavia is really like, according
to Pitt political science professor
Ronald Linden. ‘

“The ‘teeming cauldron’ image
which seems to be the Americans’
view of Yugoslavia is not really
accurate,” Linden said in a lecture
yesterday. “Yugoslavia is an
extremely diverse country, but it has
overcome much of its internal strife
over the last 40 years.”

Linden went on to point out many
of Yugoslavia’s major achievements,
most of which he believes have been

overlooked because of the country‘s
severe economic problems. Beyond
overcoming internal strife, which he

called the “major accomplishment,”

Yugoslavia has also successfully
changed leadership several times
since the death in I980 oflosip Broz
Tito, who had been president since
I953. Linden said that this change in
power is rather uncommon in coun-
tries with a one-party system.

In addition, Linden noted that “a
certain degree of political develop-
ment has occurred,” but more
important, the press in Yugoslavia
enjoys extraordinary freedom rela-
tive to other countries with similar
political systems. For example,
Yugoslav newspapers have printed
open discussions of national prob-
Iems and have even published sur-

‘The ‘teeming cauldron’ image which seems
to be the Americans’ view of Yugoslavia is

not really accurate. ’

--Ronald Linden

veys of the Yugoslavian people
which could be interpreted as critical
of the state of affairs in the Balkan
country.

Linden mentioned that there have
been some crackdowns on dissident
publishers, but not nearly as fre-
quently as in Poland orthe U.S.S.R.

Linden also outlined the severe
problems facing Yugoslavia, most of
which are directly or indirectly
related to the country's $20 billion
debt. “The debt was incurred over

the 70s, mostly to pay for the coun-
try's growth during that time,”
Linden said. The problem is further
complicated by a high level of frag-
mentation within the Yugoslavian
business network, he said.
Moreover, inflation in the‘Western
world has further worsened Yugo-
slavia’s dilemma, Linden said.

Socially, Yugoslavia faces several
problems, most of them com-
pounded by economic woes, accord-
ing to Linden. “The problem of

keeping a skilled population in the
country is crucial," he said.
Linden recently spent eight
months in Yugoslavia on a Ful-
bright Scholarship and specializes in
foreign affairs and their effect on the
Pittsburgh area. He teaches classes
in world politics and eastern Euro-
pean politics at Pitt and has pub-
lished several books on those topics.
the future

As to of U.S.-

Yugoslavian relations, Linden pre-»

dicted little change, noting that the
pattern of relations has “changed lit-
tle since Harry Truman.” Notably,
though, the U.S. has been instru-
mental in Yugoslavia's attempted
economic recovery by helping with a
“security package" designed to refi-
nance the outstanding foreign debt.

“We [she andher husband] cried," -

she said.

Regan initially entered the Peace
Corps as a secondary school teacher
in Malaysia and did extended ser-
vice there, performing social-
scientific survey work.

He said that his Peace Corps
experience has had more of an effect
on his present job than his college
education has. Regan studied Eng-
lish literature in a Massachusetts
college. He called his work in the
Peace Corps a “pretty powerful

To be a Peace Corps volunteer,

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 22, I984

Volunteers share experiences  

their good intentions, they might be
acting as the Peace Corps to offset
the military corps.

“In Thailand, during the Indo-
china War,” he said, “there was a
large Peace Corps presence. There
was also a large military presence.
One was to help offset the other.”

Secondly, Regan said, a Peace
Corps volunteer’s motivation is to
help, to contribute his skills and
services. .

“Volunteer services, then," he
said, “should be internationalized,
rather than nationalized, under the
aegis of the United Nations instead
of under the foreign policy of a given
nation." -

Regan also said he believes it
would be nice if Third World coun-
tries had a chance to come to coun-
tries like the U.S. and perform
voluntary services.

Dorothy Sullivan, a Peace Corps
recruiter in Philadelphia, did not
comment on Regan’s suggestion
about internationalizing the Peace
Corps, but she did react to his
remarks about volunteers’ using the
Peace Corps to “offset” the military

corps.

“This Peace Corps volunteer did
not make policy, so I would assume
that this is his interpretation,” she
said. “I would say that he was wrong
to say that one group was there to
offset the other unless he knows that
for a fact. As far as I know, that has
never been the case."

She said that in the 1960s, a lot of
people wondered if the Peace Corps
was “just a group of spies.”

“We were very sensitive about
that,” said Sullivan. “We went to
Congress and had them write up a
law expressly forbidding any use of a
volunteer — or any person ‘in the
Peace Corps —.- from being involved
in intelligence.” .

On the Peace Corps application, \

the applicant is asked if he has “ever
been employed by or connected with
any intelligence organizations or
otherwise engaged in related activi-
ties, either civilian or military.”

Sullivan said that anybody who
answers “yes” to this question is not
accepted into the Peace Corps.

“We do a fingerprint check on
every applicant we consider,” she
said. “If they’re lying to us, it [shows
up] on a computer. We’re very
serious about that."

Pitt has two graduate students,
Lynn Cohen and Kevin Miles, who
recently returned from a Peace
Corps mission. Cohen served in
Liberia, and Miles served in Costa
Rica. Both students were enthusias-
tic about their work as volunteers.

Miles called Peace Corps work a
“two-way relationship.”

“Both the volunteer and the peo-
ple in the host country learn and
gainfrom it,” he said. “The volun-
teer benefits much, much more in
the way of understanding the other
culture, but it’s a shared
experience.” 2

Cohen said she'd like to think that
she made a significant contribution
to her students in‘ Liberia and said,
“I know they left their mark on me.”

Peace Corps interviews
set for Pitt next month

Peace Corps representatives
will be on campus next month to
interview applicants.

Pitt has the only Peace Corps
recruiting office in Pittsburgh,
and Philadelphia represe_ntatives
visit the campus twice a year to
talk with potential volunteers.

This year, seniors will be inter-
viewed from March 6 to 8 in the
Placement Office, Room 219,
William Pitt Union. A general
information meeting will be held
in CL—326 on March 6, at 8 p.m.
It is open to the public. ' '

In addition, returned volun- '
teers will set up information
booths on Feb. 23 and 24 on the
ground floor of the William Pitt
Union and on the ground floor of
the Cathedral of Learning from
I0 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Elizabeth McDavid, , ‘Pitt’s
Peace Corps recruiter, is a
returned Peace Corps volunteer
herself, and she recruits volun-
teers from the entire Pittsburgh
area. '

She said that the staff
members at the main Peace
Corps- office in Washington,
D.C., and those at the Philadel-
phia office chose Pitt as a recruit-
ing site because it is a large
university with a large number of
students.

Pitt also has a.Center for Inter-
national Studies, which
McDavid called an “umbrella
group for all international inter-
ests, on campus.” For these rea-
sons, she said, the staff at the
regional and D.C. offices
believed that a lot of people here
would be interested in becoming
volunteers.

McDavid has been Pitt’s
recruiter for the past two years
and she said she tries to “increase
awareness about ‘the Peace
Corps among the students”

During the 1982-83 academic
' year; I2 Pitt students applied to
become Peace Corps volunteers.
Since September, McDavid has
recruited eight people from the
Pittsburgh area. Sullivan says
she believes that this is an
improvement over past years.
~ Nationwide, about I0,000
people apply to the Peace Corps
each year. Overall, recruiters
place approximately 3,500
Americans overseas every year.
Most applicants are liberal arts
' majors. . . ‘

“It is harder torecruit people
in areas "such as engineering,
nursing, math and science. Those
people are generally still employ-
able, whereas liberal arts majors
have a hard time finding jobs,"
said. Dorothy Sullivan, a Peace
Corps recruiter from Philadel-
phia.

An applicant usually has to
have a bachelor’s degree to be
accepted into the Peace Corps;

“The main exceptions are
skilled tradesmen, farmers and
health professionals -— like an
R.N. [registered nurse],” Sulli-
van said.

Last Tuesday, McDavid
hosted a gathering in the GSPIA
lounge for former volunteers in
the Pittsburgh area. She said the
meeting was held to look for peo-
ple who were “interested in start-
ing a group and/or in being a
referral for potential volun--
teers." About 25 people attended
the meeting, and some are inter-
ested in forming a permanent
group-, McDavid said.

McDavid worked as a volun-
teer in West Africa teaching
nutrition education.

Win over Lions A
brings tears to

Lady gymnasts

By A Wes ‘Cotter
And Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

They stood before a capacity
crowd at Trees Hall with tears rol-

ling down their faces. They clutched -

cacti other in a large huddle scream-
ing and rejoicing over their hard-
earned triumph. _

This was the first time in Pitt gym-
nastics history that a Lady Panther
team beat Penn State.

It was apparent after the first
event on Saturday night that the
Lady Lions‘ streak was in jeopardy.

The lady gymnasts established a
new team scoring mark, l78.95,
while Penn State managed 177.90.

Perhaps the

‘aspect ofthe performance. however,
is that the Lady Panthers defeated
the team that has been regarded as
second best to Ohio State in the east-
ern region. 

Nationally, Pitt has proven
through its consistent showings in
this I984 season that it deserves con-
sideration for the Top l0.

“It was obvious that Pitt really
wanted to win and that they were
really up for the competition,” Lady
Lion coach Judi Avener said. “They
were a better team and really looked

if terrific; They've made a phenomenal
improvement’ over last season's per-

1'i£é3rmance. and l was really
impressed." ‘
\- Just like every other Lady

Panther meet this year, All-America
Lisa Shirk,-with 37.25 points, was
the top all-around scorer. Shirk
wasn't the only Panther, however, to
do well against Penn State.

Sophomore‘Lady Panther gymnast Debbie Dabkowski performs her uneven bar.

routine.

Freshman Alisa Spector and
seniors Karen Martin and Babbie
Flock also contributed solid all-
around scores to Pitt's ‘record total.

Pitt took the lead during the first
event (the vault) and increased it on
the uneven parallel bars. Shirk and
Spector were particularly impres-
sive, posting vault scores of 9.4 and
9.2. The uneven bars were much the
same. Shirk. earned a 9.6 and Spec-
tor a 9.2. while Martin added an
8.95.

Pitt maintained a 2.85 advantage
at the midway point. The meet's ten-
sion and the crowd's volume began
to build when the Lady Lions started
picking up ground in the balance
beam competition.

“Two or three times since I've
been coaching [10 years at Pitt],
we've been beating them at half
time," Lady Panther coach Donna,
Sanft said. “then we'd lose it on the
beam, We had 7 beam like that
tonight, and it was like a nightmare
coming back again."

Fortunately for Sanft and the rest
of the squad, the difficulties on the
balance beam were held to a min-
imum. Martin gave the team aboost
with a 9.0 mark at a time when Pitt's
ladies were sliding a bit.

Penn State sophomores Renee

l.30 points from Pitt's
advantage.

The floor exercise and preserva-
tion of the l.55 lead was all that
stood in the way of the Lady Panther
victory.

“There was a whole lot of pressure
on us going into the floor." Flock
said. “We had to keep our head in it,
and we did."

The Lady Lions came charging as
Loree, Bernadette Robertson and
Kathy Pomper earned solid marks
of 9.35, 9.25 and 9.0. But unlike the
Nittany Lion football comeback last
fall, this one came up even shorter
than a tie.

The Lady Panthers were to expe-
rience one final lull before clinching
the win. Sub-par scores from Sara
Strickland and Martin further
increased the pressure on Pitt's final
four competitors. 9

Kristy Pieters' determination and
stellar effort provided the team with
a much-needed’ burst of , killer
instinct.

“Kristy has a very aggressive atti-
tude," Sanft said. “That kid does not
play it cautious; she goes for broke
all the time."

The attitude and effort resulted in

a 9.05 score.

Flock followed with the same

mark. Spector earned 'a 8.9 score
and set the scene for Shirk tovend it.

As Shirk stepped onto the mat,

the team carried a .8 overall lead,
meaning that she couldn't afford any
major mistakes. With her brash con-
fidence, Shirk never considered any
attitude but the go-for-broke of
Pieters.

Shirk performs a move in her rou-

tine called a double back. It consists
of two full revolutions in midair. She
has achieved limited success with the
move in recent weeks. ‘

Penn State's final ﬂoor competi-

tor, Loree performed the double
back to near perfection just before
Shirk was about to.

“I was very very nervous,” Shirk

said. “I didn't know if I should do
my double back because it's not very
consistent yet. lt got me psyched.
[Loree] made hers so I ‘knew if l
made my mine, I'd get a pretty good
score."

Shirk completed the double back

and received a 9.4 for her routine.

And the years of waiting to expe-

rience a victory over the arch-rival
Sta_ters had ended. ‘

Pitt swimmers
see the glory
in Big East

By Michael Weinman
The Pitt News

* All they had to do was show up
and take home the glory. Such was
the scene Saturday as the Panther
swim team went into the final day of
the‘ Big East Championship -
competition. -

The men had (led. by almost 100

7 points from the first day of the finals

on Thursday and continued to romp
over Syracuse, Boston College, Vil-
lanova, UConn., St. John's, George-
town and Seton Hall. The men
expanded their lead throughout the
rest of the meet, wrapping it all up
with an impressive 198.5 margin
over the nearest competitor, Syra-
cuse. Said one elated Pitt fan,
“We've turned this thing into a
mockery of competition.”

The mood of the swimmers mir-
rored that of their fans. The men's
team moved with tremendous capa-
bility, leaving the other schools in a»_

’Panther wake. The power with

which the men were able to domi-
nate the other schools is a credit to
the members of the team and head
coach Fred Lewis.

The evening opened up with the
long and grueling l,650-yard frees-
tyle event. Pitt's Greg Murphy
brought home the evening's first vic-
tory, despite falling short of ' the
NCAA qualifying standards.» The
other Pitt entry, Tom Shaulipski,
was third. The 1-3 finish set thetone
of the evening as Pitt went on to lock
up win after win.

The victory came as no surprise to
freestyler Ed Bahan.

‘There were nosurprises Satur-
day evening as the Lady Pan-
thers swimmers defended their
title as Big East champions:

Pitt dominated the conference
championship with 577 points.
Their biggest threat came from
the Orangewomen of Syracuse,
who placed second with 456.

According to coach David
Belowich, the championship was
the result of a strong team per-
formance. “It was a tremendous
team effort," he said. “Virtually
everyone scored and swam their
lifetime best."

Assistant coach Sandy Bizal
agreed, “It's really satisfying to
have a meet where everyone does
well."

The standout for the Lady
Panthers was freshman Tracy
Pfister. She was named the out-
standing swimmer of the meet

.-~,

and made the qualifying time for
the NCAA championships in the
200-yard individual medley.

“Tracy was definitely the
swimmer of this meet," said
Belowich. ‘

Pfister, who said the team has
greatly improved. in the last few
weeks, will also be representing
Pitt in the NCAA championship
in the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The other members of that relay
team are Denise Sedlacek, Alicia
Dugan and the anchor Susan
Hickman.

In the final night of competi-
tion, freshman‘ Jodi O'Neil also
made NCAA qualifying time and
established a new meet record in
the 200-yard breaststroke.

“l was really happy to make
the time,” she said.‘“l've got to
thank the whole team because
they gave me so much support."

O'Neil, who fell short of
national cuts in several events,
still swam her personal best times
and set two school records. M

For the second consecutive
year, Belowich was named Big
East coach of the year. He attrib-
utesthe honor to the perfor-
mance of his swimmers.

“Being named Big East coach
is just a result of their fantastic
swimming,” said Belowich. “I'll
cherish it because of that."

Belowich, a Grove City Col-
lege graduate, is in his third year
as head coach for the Lady
Panthers.

Other top teams in the meet
were Boston College, third with
376 points, and Villainpva, fourth ,
with a 353.5 point total. '

Belowich believes that the
teams in the Big East proved to
be more competitive than last
year. He said that is theresultof
the teams putting more of an
emphasis on being in the Big East
conference. He is looking for
other teams in the conference to
keep improving and posing an
even greater threat next year.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Afew years
ago, a book came out about the
Pittsburgh Steelers whose title aptly
describes the Panther track team,
“Three Bricks Shy of a Load.”

Three bricks is about all that may
have stood between the Panthers
and the Big East Championship at
the Carrier Dome over the weekend.

Thinking back to two years ago,
the Pitt track team had talent but
very poor guidance and little direc-
tion, and all Pitt alumni could do
was remember the Panther greats
from years past.

Much like the Steelers, the
Panther fortunes hinged on the
acquisition of a new coach, and in
the fall of 1982, John Vasvary was
named to head the Pitt men’s track
program. At the time, Pitt athletic
director Edward Bozik said that

SATURDAY, MARCH IO 8-ll PM

Dale Moore/ The Pitt News
Garland Brown of Pitt runs out in front ofthe rest of
the 800-meter field at the Big East championships.

Vasvary “understands the need to
rebuild a winning program at Pitt.”
Boy, did he ever. 4

Hired in August, Vasvary walked
into a program in disarray and by
February, had molded the second
best team in the Big East conference.
He did this with no recruits of his
own while adjusting to the adminis-
trative pathways of the Pitt athletic
department.

This season, Vasvary has his own
recruits for the first time, but the
year of recruiting that he lost still
haunts him with very few sopho-
mores on his squad. Vasvary makes
no excuses, however; he takes what
he has and squeezes every last drop
of talent and energy out of it.

This was evident again this week-
end at the Big East indoor track and
field championship. The Panthers
took third this year compared to
second last season but only lost the
title by I 7 points this year, compared
to 39 a year ago. ‘

Panthers a few bricks shy

Seventeen points in this meet are
not very many. First place is worth
l0 points in itself and a team gets
points all the way down to one for
sixth place, so the Panthers were
definitely in the hunt.

Believe it or not, Pitt could have
brought the trophy home for Vas-
vary’s wall this season ifa few things
could have been different.

The first brick missing was sopho-
more shot putter Bob Buczkowski.
ln I983, Buczkowski won the shot
with a throw that would have won
the event again this year. Unfortu-
nately for the Panthers, Buckowski
injured his shoulder during the foot-
ball season and couldn‘t throw this
year. Subtract I0 from the 17 points

_ by which the Panthers lost and now

they are losing by seven.

Brick number two was senior Joe
McCall. Last year, McCall placed
fifth in the 55—meter dash, collecting

two points for the Panthers. This A

year, McCall was attending a pro
football scouting camp, was held up
and missed his flight to Syracuse. If
McCall would have made it and
taken the fifth place he did last sea-
son, he would have scored two
points for the Panthers and taken
two points away from the eventual
champions, Seton Hall, by knocking
one of their runners to sixth and one
to seventh. This four point swing
would have made Pitt just three
points shy of the team title which
now would have been shared by_Vil-
lanova and Seton Hall.

The third and final brick missing
from a Big East championship team
was Brian Pollock, the defending
Big East indoor champion in the
300—meter dash. Pollock, who will
be able to run again in April, would
have needed to place only fourth for
the Panthers to have worn the Big
East crown. Three bricks shy.

All of this speculation only
accomplishes one thing; it wastes
time. Time is something that is very
precious to Vasvary and something’
he rarely wastes reflecting on the
past. Instead, Vasvary looks to the
future, a future that looks very nice
indeed.

With the freshmen Vasvary has
now and Pollock and Buczkowski
available in the future, the Panthers
make a formidable foe. And when he
talks of the new recruits he is now
pursuing, one can’t help but get
excited just listening to Vasvary’s
enthusiasm.

iWhen Vasvary talks about the
future of Pitt track in the Big East,
he puts it in no uncertain terms.

“Next year, we’ll be loaded for

bear."

Despite being outnumbered,
Lady Panthers place sixth

By Maria Garcia
The Pitt News

SYRACUSE — Coach Elbert
Kennedy took his small but talented
Lady Panther team of six to Syra-
cuse, N.Y., for the Big East Cham-
pionships over the weekend and
proved. that good things can still
come in small packages.

The meet had all measures of tal-
ent. There were teams with greater
numbers, like Boston College (36
members) and Georgetown (23

- members), but the small-in-number

Lady Panthers held their own with a
respectable sixth-place (46 points)
finish.

Villanova captured the team title
for the second straight year with a
total of 164 points. Connecticut was
second (99), St. John‘s placed third
(72), while host Syracuse and
Georgetown were fourth (61) and
fifth (48), respectively.

“We‘re right up there, [despite]

the number of runners we have,”

said Kennedy.

The Big East Championship was
experienced in differing ways by the
individual Lady Panthers.

It was the first appearance for
freshmen Felicia Blake and Edith
Butler. Blake placed fifth (l:16.00)
in the 500-meter dash, garnering two
points for the squad.

“I ran well, [but] I guess it was
God’s will if I didn't win," she said.
Kennedy said that Blake is naturally
an 800-meter runner who, in time,
will run the '500-meter better.

For Butler, it was another per-
sonal triumph as well as the new
experience. She came through with a
second place in the 400-meter dash
with a time of 56.26, beating the old
Big East mark of 56.64.

“I think I ran the best race of the
year," Butler remarked. “I'm not dis-
appointed with a second; I improved
my time.’.‘ She ran a competitive
race, as only Veronica McIntosh,

WIIO SCI 8 TICW COIITCTCDCC l'CCOI'd '

(55.87), was able to outdo her.

Junior sprinter Renee Henderson
came back in '84 as the 55- and 300-
meter dash champion and record
holder in both events. She estab-
lished new conference records as she
successfully defended her two titles.
In the 300-meter dash, she broke the
tape in 39.39, while in the 55-meter,
she was clocked at 7.02.

“I had the third-fastest time going
into the finals; since I had lane six, I
had to go out a little harder,” she
said. '

Henderson performed up to
Kennedy’s expectations. “I figured
Renee would do well.”

Sophomore Gail Count§ scored
points with a third place in-the 55-
meter dash with a time of 7.21. She
was fifth in the 300-meter sprint with

I a time of 41.26.

“[Counts] ran the 55 real good.
but the 300 could’ve been better,”
said Kennedy.

“Sue did her part in the relay; she
ran well," said Kennedy.

The mile relay team, which con-
sisted of Blake, Henderson, Torre
and Butler, turned in a strong per-
formance. The team was third in a
time of 3:55.27. The victory went to
Villanova, whose time of 3:49.88
established a new meet record.

“I made a move too early in the
race," Henderson said. Kennedy
countered, “She excelled too much
at one time." . ~

Counts was previously scheduled
to run the relay but was hurt after
the 300—meters, so Torre ﬁlled in.
“Sue did really good taking my
place," Counts said.

Though the team’s fastest mark of
the season is 3:50.23, Kennedy was
pleased with the performance of the
relay team. “I didn’t think we were
going to win it, but I knew we were
going to be right up there with
them," he said.

Although sixth place in the over-
all standings is probably not some-
thing to brag about for the teams
like Villanova and Connecticut -
who finished 1-2 —— for the Lady
Panthers, six strong, the sixth place
was hard-earned and certainly
something of which to be proud.

“I could’ve run a better race in the
300-meters,“ Counts added.

Sue Torre ran the 55-meter dash,
coming in fourth in her heat with a
time of 7.55, then seventh in the
finals with a improved mark of 7.5 1.
She failed to place in the 300 but ran
an impressive leg in the 1,600-
(4x400) meter relay.

Brown, Pitt
shines at
Big East

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Afterthou-
sands of practice miles and two days
of competition, the Big East men’s
indoor track and field champion-
ships boiled down/to a little more
than three minutes. Unfortunately
for t_he Pitt Panthers, they were not
involved in the race for first, but for
third.

Entering the final event, the l600-
meter relay, the Pirates of Seton
Hall and the ever-powerful Villa-
nova Wildcats were tied for the lead.

Now everything was simple; the first -

team to cross the finish line won the
title. All that was left to figure out
was who it would be.

Villanova, the bully of the east
with all the distance power, includ-
ing five Irishmen and an English-
man, versus Seton Hall with its new
crop of Nigerians, who are taking
the sprint world by storm. ,

The smart money was on Seton
Hall,’ whose world-record freshman

relay team had run six seconds faster A

than the Villanova quartet. But the
Wildcats may have been the senti-
mental favorites just because of
national pride, since the Villanova
relay was made up ofAmericans and
the Pirates’ composition included
two Nigerians.

Over the first 1200 meters the.
Wildcats held a lead of less than five
yards over Seton Hall, and at the
start of the anchor leg, both teams
werejust as they had started — dead
even. ‘

Villanova’s John Marshall settled
in front with ‘Mitchell Blanks of
Seton Hall right on his shoulder,
and coming off the last turn, they,
were tied stride for stride. In the last
35 meters, Seton Hall showed why
they are world record holders and
took home the Big East crown while
Villanova felt the pa-in of defeat.

Although the Panthers lost the
meet on points, they put on a spec-
tacular show to take home third
place. Coaches John Vasvary and
Steve Lewis had their squad ready
and got every ounce out of all their
people. ’

“In a meet like that, you wonder if
you lost or not,” said Vasvary after
the meet. “When the kids perform
like that, it makes you feel really
good and really proud of them.”

Pitt again took home honors, this
time both outstanding performer
and performance for the meet.

Junior Roger Kingdom, who was
named the outstanding performer

A last year, completed his set by col-

lecting the outstanding performance
award this year on the basis of win-
ning the 55-meter hurdles with a
blistering time of 7.l2 seconds,
breaking his old meet record. King-
dom also placed second in the 55-
meter dash and in the highjump to
collect 26 team points for the Pan-
hers. Not a bad days work.

Completing the sweep for the
Panthers was senior Garland
Brown, who put on the show of his
career by winning the 800-meter run
going away in a time of l:50.l3,
good enough to break the meet
record and qualify for the NCAA
championships. Brown also ran the
800-meter leg of the distance medley _
relay in l:50.3 and a leg of the win-
ning 3200—meter relay, holding off
Villanova and keeping them from at
least tying for the meet title.

For his effort, Brown was voted
outstanding performer of the meet
by the coaches of the Big East.

Syracuse routs Lady hoopsters

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

SYRACUSE — Pitt’s female
hoopsters were blown out of first
place in the Big East by the Oran-
gewomen of Syracuse 88-67 Satur-
day night in the Carrier Dome.

Pitt coach Judy Saurer refused to
comment on any aspect of the brutal
defeat.

The Lady Panthers (14-10, 5-2 in
the Big East) could not shut down a
hard-driving, hot-shooting Syracuse
squad, that raised its record to 13-13
overall and 4-3 in the conference-

“They were playing above their
level, and we didn't play up to ours,"
said Pitt’s Ellen Gilhooley, who left
the game at 6:49 in the second half
when a Syracuse player fell on her
injury-weakened knee.

Gilhooley. garnered ll rebounds

g and 12 points.

The Lady Panthers, who won four
of their last five games, including the
last three conference games, did not
help their cause by shooting 33 per-
cent from the field, compared to
Syracuse’s 59 percent. Pitt was also
hurt by the home teams tree—topper
troupe (the five players over 6 feet).

Juiced up for a contest dedicated
to the ‘three seniors competing for
the final time in the Dome, Syracuse
handed Pitt its second lopsided loss
in two. weeks, the other being a
shocker at Penn State.

Senior Orangewoman Connie
Stough, who sank six of seven from
the field in a 20-point, l0—assist
effort, was the game’s MVP, as she

Pitt repeats
in Big East

continued from page thirteen

“Last year, we didn’t do as well
because we didn’t shave like this
year...these guys [Syracuse] come up
here and think they’ll be able to take
us on like they did last year, but that
just wasn’t going to happen. No
way."

Bahan started off his evening by a

setting a new meet record for the
I00-yard freestyle, while Pitt
swimmer J.D. McCrillis followed
closely for a 1-2 win. 

Bahan said the team as a whole
was swimming faster this year than it
did last and that they “still have a lot
of tapering down to do, which
means we’ll be even stronger at East-
erns,” next week in North Carolina.
Bahan hopes to be able to qualify for
NCAA meet through the Eastern
regional championship.

The men’s team as a unit -was far
and away above the competition,
winning all but one of the events on

the evening, the 200-yard butterfly, ,

in which Pitt took third. Points from
a Donald Martin meet record in the
200—yard breast stroke proved that

swimming is a team sport in which .

depth is absolutely pivotal.

Pitt backstroker Ed Bergan was a
little surprised at the speed with
which the team was pulling away
from the other schools. “I thought
we were going to win, but I didn’t
think we’d be doing this to them.‘-’
Bergan also set a meet record in the
men‘s 200—yard backstroke. The race
seemed like deja vu, as Rich James
made it another 1-2 Pitt trouncing.

The men put the meet to bed as
Bahan, McCrillis, Martin and
Murphy teamed up for the final
event of the evening, the 400—yard
freestyle relay. The Pitt swimmers
blew away the so—called competition
and established yet another meet
record.

. It was no surprise then that Pitt
won Best Men's Swimmer, awarded
to Greg Murphy, and men‘s Coach
of the Year, awarded to Fred Lewis.
The next meet on the schedule
should prove to be a test for the
Panthers, believe it or not. The East-
ern regional championships, March
I-3. in Greensville, North Carolina,
should bring out an even better per-
formance from the Big East’s No. l

moved into second place on the
team’s all-time scoring list with
l.l62 points.

“We just came off a big win over
Providence [then tied for first],‘’ said
Stough. “We’re peaking at the right
time. I just got‘ my adrenalin going.-
Everything fell in place tonight."

The only Lady Panther with any

scoring success was Jennifer Bruce '

(24.3 ppg, 9.7 rpg), who led all scor-
ers with 29 points and 14 rebounds.

Coach Barbara Jacobs credited
her team's 2-3.defense as the founda-
tion of her team‘s commanding
victory. .

“‘We were collapsing and sagging’ ‘

on-Bruce,” said Jacobs. “We mixed
defenses — l-3-l, 2-3, man-to-man
—— but it was our collapsing 2-3 that
did it." ‘

Lady Panther Stephanie Collins
agreed with Jacobs. “We didn’t
attack their 2-3 zone," she remarked.

“They are really big and weren’t
able to get the ball inside,” Collins
said, adding that she did not think
Syracuse normally played that well.

The Orangewomen, who entered
the game averaging 68.8 points per
game, received some uncharacteris-
tic scoring help from Janice Long, a
seven ppg player who contributed 13
points.

“We’ve been playing well together
[recently],” Long said. “At first, we
had a hard time getting used to each
other.” ’

  Collect

Syracuse has ‘ fallen on rough
times since mid-December, when the
team was a promising 3-l. Further-
more, a shoulder dislocation
benched the team’s veteran point
guard, Jaedeane Daye, who was
replaced by Long.

However, the team is in prime
condition now, according to Jacobs.

“We're happy where we are,” J ac-
obs said. “We were sky-high for this

game. We have a lot of respect for 1

Pitt — we expected a real dogﬁght
all the way."

“It was the most physical game .

we’ve played,"_Collins, asserted. ‘‘In
the very first play otiithe’ game, Jen
[Bruce] was elbowed in the chest,
and from there we just said, ‘OK’ —
that’s the kind of game it would be.”

Tonight at 5:45 p.m. the Lady
Panthers host Cleveland State in the
first game of a doubleheader for the
Pitt's men’s team. '

It is the final home contest of the
season with the Big East champion-
ships set for the weekend of March
4. ‘

“We could have wrapped it up [at
Syracuse],” said Collins in reference
to earning at least a tie for first in the
conference seedings. “Now it's down
to Boston College,” she said, adding
that Cleveland is “always ready to
kill us.”

“We can’t give up now,” said
Gilhooley.

Pitt divers
dominate
Big East

By Gabrielle Pease
The Pitt News

Printed on the backs of the T-
shirts of Pitt’s divers is coach Julian

Krug’s simple motto, ‘ATTACK!’

And attack is exactly what l(rug’s
divers have done this season. At the
Big East conference championship
meet’ over the weekend, the blue and
gold terry cloth robes of Pitt’s diving
corps dominated the awards
platform.

‘Sophomores Tricia Schultz and A

Todd Mulzet won both of the out-
standing individual awards, while a
host of supporters contributed to an
impressive output.

Lady Panther divers Tricia Ney
and Jennifer Brown performed in
their first championship competi-
tions and placed among the tops in
the conference. M

Pitt’s men divers also brought
home the team points. Sophomore
Mike McCalley set a new meet
record on the 3~meter board while
Mark McCormick and John Dusch
took second and third place, respec-

, tively. On the l-meter board, Mulzet

T_h_e_ 19;: News, Wednesday, February 22, i984  

took the top spot, with McCormick
finishing third.

‘ For the first time in Krug’s Pitt
coaching career, there is an abun-

ur professional stylists know that to custom cut your hairthe way you want, the}
ust listen to what you want. That's why at Great Expectations you'll lea .
with the style you had in mind...at a price you can afford.

dance of divers. “in numbers there is
strength. We have the numbers of
people who pull together,” Krug
said. ’ P

The diving program at Pitt has
certainly dominated the East in this
1984 season. Nine divers, six men
and three women, put Pitt at the top
of the list in Eastern diving.

A program ofthis size cannot help
but dominate in championship com-
petition. Yet Krug says there is no
recruiting done for his team. “I’ll
take anybody that comes. Nobody is
here because of the swim team’s
reputation.”

Krug has been instrumental in
establishing Pitt as a diving supre-
macy in the East. He is known for
the coaching of the Pitt Aquatic
Club divers, one of the outstanding
Junior Olympic programs in the
Country. .

Krug has coached two All-
Am-erica divers in his five years as
diving coach for Pitt. He recorded
top finishes in men’s and women’s
Big East diving last year.

Krug attributes the team‘s success
to motivation. “As a coach, l expect
our teams to be competitive nation-
ally,” Krug said.

This year, Krug’s goals have nine
times the chance of being reached.

“Whereas most teams work with one

or two competitive divers, Krug has
primed nine for NCAA competition.

The men’s team competition con-
tinues at the Eastern regional cham-
pionships March 1-3, in Greenville,
N.C.

For both teams, the prime contest
for qualification nationally comes

does nothing special. “I teach them
to enjoy the activities of perfor-
mance and practice. Then the trick is

to stay out of the way,” Krug said. “I,
can be a detriment. l’m under a lot of..-

pressure as the diving coach. l have
to isolate them from that pressure.”

With Pitt’s diving program on the
verge of making an impact nation-
ally, Krug believes that more schol-
arships are necessary to develop
consistency at that top-notch level.

“I know that there will be dry
spells. But I also know how to work

A PULIC sanvrcs MESSAGE FROM

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

lt’s a

“breeze for
Panthers

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

, To say that Pitt (I2-I) walloped
Eastern Michigan and Schoolcraft
Junior College Friday night would
probably not do justice.

The Panther gymnasts won by
over 80 points, that‘s correct, 80
points. Pitt’s opponents were out of
the running before they suited up.
That’s just how bad a mismatch this
one was.

207.8, and the more hapless School-

Pitt’s men scored 258.85 to the
measly output of Eastern Michigan,

craft offering of 177.1.

Aside from the lack of decent
competition, the meet had other
difficulties;

Several Panther gymnasts were
particularly vocal when the topic of
equipment at the meet entered
conversation.

At most Division I schools. such
as Pitt, the still rings apparatus con-
sists of a stainless steel frame from
which the rings hang. At Eastern
Michigan, two ropes dangled from

.t.he ceiling.

The pommel horse had cracks in
it. and the rusty high bar had to be
tightened for the competition.

“Working on the high bar was like
working on a tree branch,"junior Ed
Miller commented.

“I was afraid of the high bar
because I got rust on my hand when
I mounted,” sophomore Mark I(laf—
ter said.

“We did a good job with the con-
ditions we had to work with,”

. Panther coach Frank D’Amico said.

A In the floor exercise, the Panthers
took an easy sweep with K1after’s
scoring a 9.65 (tying a school record)
to capture first while senior Dave
Smith was second (9.25). Sopho-
mores Marty Comini and Matt
Peters scored 9.15, ,which was
enough for third.

Pitt freshman Ben Rovee com-
peted in his first collegiate meet. He
scored a respectable 8.4 in theifloor
exercise. ‘

D’Amico commended Rovee.

Q “Ben did his best ever on the floor;

he received an 8.4 from both
judges." I

Rovee wastgiven much time to
prepare mentally for the test.

“I was told 15 minutes before the
competition that I was going to com-
pete,” said Rovee. “That was my
first college competition." but I
wasn’t nervous." I I

Peters led a I-2-3 finish on the
pommel horse. as he received a mark
of 8.55. Klafter and senior Frank
Kratz were second (8.4) and third

CA (7.9). respectively.

Kratz has been slowly recovering
from a pulled muscle in his right
arm. He hopes to be back at full‘
strength when the Panthers travel to
Ohio State in two weeks.

On the rings. the only event Pitt
failed to sweep, Klafter was first
(9.3). He was followed by Eastern
Michigan’s Marcel Humel (8.9)
while third place went to Smith of
Pitt who scored an 8.5.

At the end of three events, Pitt,

Qwith 126.4, had opened up an insur-
mountable lead of 27.55 over East-
ern Michigan and 43.25 over
Schoolcraft.

Pitt continued the sweep with an
easy I-2-3 finish in the vault. The
Panthers were led by Smith (9-30)
with support from Peters (9.15) and
Klafter (9.05).

On the parallel bars, Klafter’s 9.25
was high while Peters and Smith
were second (9.l5) and third (8.85).

T In the final event (the high bar).
the Pitt trio again dominated.
Peters, despite the rust. led the way
with a 9.45 with Smith and Klafter
not far behind for-second (9.25) and
third (9.2). respectively.

Clarion spoils
grapplers’ day

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

The brief moment during which
the Pitt wrestling team held the lead
in Saturday's loss to Clarion proved
just too good to be true.

The Golden Eagles went on to
spoil Pitt’s Senior Appreciation Day

‘by beating the Panthers.26—l5 at

Fitzgerald Field House.
For a while, though, the decision
remained hanging in the balance.

* Senior JeffJeIic, Pitt’s stellar I67-lb.

participant, pinned Clarion’s Scott
Hall after three minutes and 24
seconds of punishment.

It marked the final time that Jelic
and five fellow seniors would suit up
at Fitzgerald.

“Though I tend to down play
things a lot, today went just about
the way I wanted it to,"Jelic said. “It
was certainly nice to go out with a
win, particularly a pin."

“What can you say about a kid
like Jeff Jelic?” Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer asked. “He’s. an ideal
student-athlete. Hejust got accepted
to dental school; needless to say,
we’re very proud him."

Jelic is one of the favorites to win
the Eastern Wrestling League 167-
lb. class title and should be a strong
contender for the Eastern regional

Qchampionship.

“I should win Easterns,” he said.
“We beaten everybody in the
weight. If I wrestle the way I know I
can, then I should win.”

The other Panther winners Satur-
day were Kyle Nellis, John Hnath
and Joe Bond.

Nellis, whose brother Ken over-
whelmed Pitt’s Greg Dille 23-5, won
a hard-fought match with Paul
Clark at the I26-lb. weight.

“It’s fun to have a brother on the

if ' other team, but it’s different," Kyle

Nellis said. “I just try to sit back and

enjoy the match rather than picking ,

a side.”

The match was more easily enjoy-
able for Kyle after he won his earlier
match.

Hnath, who was supposed to face

. Mark Ciccarella, the first-ranked

I34-pounder in the country, was
matched with Bill Arnold. Hnath
decisioned Arnold 6-3.

Ciccarella met Joe Throckmorton
in the l42—lb. match. Although

at-Throckmorton has defeated Cicca-

rella twice in his collegiate career,
Saturday was not to mark the third
such occurrence. Ciccarella man-
aged a 9-4 decision.

Pitt’s Bond, the other Panther
winner, defeated Glenn Ammon in a
I58-lb. matchup, which proved to be
the closest decision of the match.
Bond squeezed out a 7-6 victory.

“Joe Bond did a real nice job,"
Stottlemyer said. “He came up with
a big win, but we felt we needed to
win at least three of the first four
matches, and we could only get two
of them.”

Following Jelic’s pin, the Pan-
thers fell apart. Clarion’s Brian Kes-
neck (177-lbs.) gained a superior
decision over Kurt Joseph I9-6. The
Joseph defeat was followed a pin by
the Golden Eagles’ Jim Beichner
over freshman Jack Uppling at the
3:46 mark.

In the heavyweight position, Cur-

tis Conner made a good effort but
was eventually beaten by Clarion’s
Kirk Butryn 15-4.
The Golden Eagles appear" to be
headed for the Eastern Wrestling
Championships, to be held at Mil-
lersville State University, while the
Panthers have a couple individuals,
like Jelic and Nellis, who could qual-
ify for the NCAA championships on
March 9 and I0 at the
Meadowlands.

Senior finale

 

Karl Kobil/ The Pitt News

Senior co-captain Jeff Jelic (top) wrestled for the final time at Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday when he pinned Scott Hall of ‘Clarion...See story page 21

continued from page nine

Another Panther who turned in
an exceptional effort was Jesse
Mikell. The freshman set a school
record in the 300-meter dash while
qualifying for the finals on Saturday
with a clocking of 34.45 and nearly
broke his own record on Sunday by
taking third place with a time of
34.52. Mikell was also a member of
the Panther l600—meter relay team
that placed third in what Vasvary
termed “one of the very best efforts
of the meet.”

pole vaulters Rodney Chobany, Bill
Lantz and Jim Johnson. Coach
Lewis’s trio finished fourth, fifth and
sixth, respectively, each clearing a
height of 13-11 ‘A. ’

Senior Ralph Mitton kept up his
quality work by taking third in the
triple jump with a leap of 49-2 1/4.
Mickey Rihtarchik ran a stong race
in the trials of the l000—meter run
and joined teammates Bill Moor-
head and Todd Colas in the finals.

The meet was not without disap-

pointment for Pitt, however._ Sprin-

ter/hurdler Joe McCall was unable

Pitt trackmen finish thirds  

camp. V

Freshman Tim Manes did not
qualify for the finals of the 500-
meter, nor did Alan Laws in the 400-
meter run, and senior Todd Colas
placed a disappointing third in the
1000-meter run but came back
strong in his leg of the 3200-meter
relay. ‘

On a whole, the weekend could be
termed nothing less than an out-
standing success. Perhaps Coach
Lewis summed it up best after the
meet ended Sunday. ‘

‘ “We didn’t lose.” said Lewis.

    
     
   
   
     
 

Another pleasant surprise for the
Panthers was the performances of

delayed at a pro football training_
