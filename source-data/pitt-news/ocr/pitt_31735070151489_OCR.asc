STRASBOURG, France — The Statue of Lib-
erty looks out of place here. The iconic Ameri-
can sculpture, a gift from the French, has no
business outside of a laser tag arcade in the
suburbs of Strasbourg, France.

And yet, here it is. The dark gray imitation
of “La Liberte Eclairant 1e Monde” stands more
than 10 feet high, perched atop a concrete oval
structure on the edge of a strip—mall parking
lot, the torch extending well over the 6—foot—6
man nearby.

Ricardo Greer is here to set up for his son’_s
eighth birthday party.

The former Pitt Panther has spent 10 of the
last 11 years playing basketball in this country.
In that time, h€s won the French Pro A League
(Ligue Nationale de Basket, or LNB) twice, won
MVP once, and has made numerous _Al1—Star

him one of the best, if not the best, Americans

Professor charged with wife’s murder  not face death penalty

Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

A Pitt researcher charged with killing
his wife last April will not face the death
penalty.

The office of Allegheny County
District Attorney Stephen Zappala an-
nounced on Monday that the require-
ments for capital punishment were not
found in the case. A

Mike Manko, a spokesman for Zap-

pala’s office, stated that in “this case
there was no option because the case
did not qualify as a death penalty case.”

Robert A. Ferrante, 65, a professor
who’s currently on indeﬁnite leave in
Pitt’s neurology department was ar-
rested late last July and charged with
the murder of his late wife, Autumn
Klein. '

According to the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Corrections, the death pen-
alty may only be appliedin cases of

ﬁrst-degree murder. A separate hearing
is held to determine if any aggravating
or mitigating circumstances occurred.

Pennsylvania law’s aggravating cir-
cumstances include cases where the

victim was a public servant (e.g.,- ﬁre-l

ﬁghter, judge or law enforcement offi-
cial), where thevictim was held for ran-
som or as a hostage, where the victim
was a prosecution witness to a felony
committed by the defendant and was
killed to prevent testimony, where the

victim was killed by means of torture

and where the victim was killed as part

of a murder_for pay. ‘r

If an aggravating circumstance is -

found, the verdict is death. A judge will
then formally sentencethe defendant.
The state Supreme, Court will automati-
cally review a cas egafter sentencing, and
may choose to strike the death penalty
for a life sentence.

Formal arraignment of Ferrante is
scheduled to occur this week. I

images of the eye.

According to Nischal, the mount
gives surgeons a consistent method
that allows for the repeated and accu-
rate imaging of the patients’ eyes. The
product has been used in surgeries that
utilize stem cells to restore vision to
blind children.

“The mechanical arm adds dimension
to the accuracy of acquiring images that
we didn’t have before,” Nischal said.

The students who designed the mount
are all members of the Pitt organiza-
tion ESMD, or Engineers for Sustain-
able Medical Development, and began
their work on the device in November
of last year.

According to Karuna Relwani, a
co-founder and previous president of
ESMD, the group is currently working
on several design projects within the
Pittsburgh medical community. The
group has worked alongside the Coulter
Translational Research Partners 11 Pro-

gram, a Pitt program within the Swanson
School of Engineering that identiﬁes,
selects and develops new designs and
technologies to be commercialized for
the medical market.

The students in ESMD emphasize
sustainable technologies. One group
produced an ophthalmoscope, another

devicethat uses light technology to
study the eye, that does not need bat-
tery replacements. Instead, the students
inserted a circuit into the device that
recharges the capacitor when shaken,
like a shake ﬂashlight or a kinetic self-
charged watch.

For those who use it, the M—OCT is‘
a device that makes the process of eye
surgery much simpler. The handheld
OCT device is placed inside a ﬁtted
mount. The ﬁtted mount extends off
a mechanical arm that resembles the
shape of the number seven, allowing the
surgeon to position the ﬁxture directly
over the patient. The arm pivots to al-
low a circular motion around the entire
diameter of the eye.

Kira Lathrop, a physician in eye stem
cell research at UPMC Eye Center, aided
the students in the project.

Lathrop described the OCT device
that she had been using in surgery as a
handheld instrument that looked similar
to a hair dryer.

Previously, surgeons manually held
the OCT device, which made it difﬁ-
cult to work with the instrument for
long periods of time. It also made the
movements less precise because it was
physically difficult for a person to move
the microscope around the eye during

surgery.

The mount allows surgeons to more
easily use the light technology to view
the eye during medical procedures.

“They should be really proud. This is
an uncommon thingto accomplish and
they-worked very hard,” Lathrop said.

Nischal said that he and Lathrop had

discussed the difﬁculties of using the

handheld OCT device, and Lathrop then’
relayed that information to the team of
ESMD students. With Lathrop’s help,
the group then began working on mount
designs for the M-OCT.

Lathrop said that the group learned
from trial and error and hands—on expe-
rience in the design of the M-OCT. For al-
most a year, the group made adjustments
to the design until they agreed on a ﬁn-
ished product, Which they submitted to
the annual MG Wellsstudent Healthcare
Entrepreneurship Competition.

“Personally, [the group] was really
good. The instrument is terriﬁc and we
really want to take it into the next stage,”
Lathrop said. -

The group recently ﬁled for a patent
for the M-OCT design. The group is now
considering licensing the M-OCT with
OCT microscope manufacturers.

Grants from the Michael G. Wells En-
trepreneurial Scholars Fund are awarded
annually through - the competition in
early October to students who develop
new products for which the medical
community expresses a need. After
students design and develop a device,
it is made available at facilities such as
UPMC hospitals to be used in medical
procedures.

Finalists in the competition are
chosen by a panel of judges from the
Pittsburgh business community and are
awarded $10,000 for further research
and production of their medical’inven—
tions.

The winners of this year’s competi-
tion were announced on Oct. 2. Two
Pitt graduate students, Donald Taylor,
a bioengineering graduate student,.and
Austin Nuschke, a pathology graduate
student, placed ﬁrst for their Bio-ban-
dages, which are bandages that use stem
cells to regrow skin cells within injuries.

V Although they didn’t place ﬁrst, the l

four undergraduates from ESMD are
still very proud of their work with the

M-OCT and its successful use in the _

medical ﬁeld.

Harker, who majors in bioengineer-
ing, said that he was proud that the M-
OCT had already been used in surgery
two weeks before the ﬁnalists were an-
nounced. A

He said that although the group did
not win the competition, placing as ﬁ-
nalists was “icing on the cake” of an
overall great experience.

Lee, a mechanical engineer who
worked on the project, agreed.

“I thought being in the competition
was a great learning experience because

we got exposure to sides of engineering 0

that we never get in our classes,-such as
the patenting process and how to create
a good sales presentation,” Lee said. I.

US News 8£VVorld Report rankings

pose problems for students, colleges

Simon Brown
Columnist

Think back to junior year of
high school. Your parents and
guidance counselors had just
begun asking you to consider
where you might want to at-
tend college.

But this proved no easy task.
The heaps of college brochures,
all depicting gray-haired pro-
fessors pontiﬁcating to a hand-
ful of students gathered in a cir-
cle outside a gothic collegiate
hall, only confused matters.

Everything was clarified,

however, when you discov-

ered that some Samaritan had
ranked the “best colleges,” and
published them online for ev-
eryone to easily evaluate. That

* savior was most-likely the U.S.

News & World Report —-—- the
holy grail of college rankings.

This measurement, which
guides the decisions of so
many high school students,
says nothing about the actual
value of the education that a
university is capable of deliver-
ing, however. And it misleads
not only confused high school
overachievers, but senior uni-
versity trustees, as well.

U.S. News 8: World Report
became the first organization
to compile and publish numeric
university rankings in its maga-
zine in 1983. Since then, it has
reigned as the definitive mea-
surement for university success

A - a fact well known to parents,

prospective students and ad-

ministrators. By 2007, when

the magazine first published
its rankings online, the site re-
ceived 10 million views within

three days‘ -—- compared to its
typical 500,000 per month.
The University of Pittsburgh
has remained dropped from no.
58 to no. 62 between 2012 and
2013. ‘
Curious high schoolers
aren’t the only ones who keep
an eye on these rankings. It
is not uncommon for alumni
and donors to follow the rank-

ings as a way of keeping their ,

alma mater’s chancellor and
administrators accountable.
The contract for the president
of Arizona State University,
for example, stipulates a raise
if the university’s ranking as-
cends in the rankings.

The inherent flaw with using
the U.S. News & World Report
rankings as a guide for univer-
sity choice and policy lies in
its methodology. The rankings
measure across seven catego-
ries, with each weighted differ-
ently according to importance.

The most heavily weighted
measurement category’ is “un—
dergraduatei academic repu-
tation.” U.S. News compiles
this score by surveying both
senior university faculty from
various institutions and high
school guidance counselors.
Respondents are asked to rank
universities from one to five for
their quality or else respond “I
don’t know.”

Immediately, the problem
becomes clear. Most respon-
dents would have experience
only with a limited range of
universities, but since the U.S.
News rankings are so widely
known, it would certainly re-
ceive‘ responses from profes-
sors whose only knowledge of

5

less prestigious universities
comes from the rankings them-
selves. So the responses of the
previous year strongly inﬂu-
ence the single most-weighted
category of the following year.
In this way, the rankings per-
petuate themselves year to year.

On closer inspection, this
same problem runs through
each of the other categories —
to the point that it deﬁnes the

A methodology of the test.
Consider, for instance, the

“student selectivity” category.
It encompasses the overall ac-
ceptance rate — total admis-
sions divided by total appli-
cants — alongwith average SAT
scores and high school class
rankings. A university that can
attract many applicants, but
admits very few, is in an ideal
position to rise in the rankings.
V This criterion suffers from
the same problem of self—per—
petuation, since students will
apply en masse to the universi-
ties that top the rankings and,
not coincidentally, also admit
the fewest students. According
to the 2014 rankings, Princeton
and Harvard —— the top two
schools on the list — admit-
ted 7.8 percent and 6 percent of
applicants, respectively.

The real flaw in this mea-
surement, however, lies in
its skewed understanding of
a university’s mission. While
the private colleges that occupy
the first 20 spots in the rank-
ings need not feel committed
to making education widely ac-
cessible to their communities,
public universities are obligat-

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

After reading an editorial published on Oct. 30 about a referendum to require all police
officers and ﬁreﬁghters to live within city limits, I am embarrassed by the lack of compassion
conveyed by the editorial staff toward those who courageously serve and protect our community.

As students, we’ve witnessed the great work of these individuals in Oakland during such
tragedies as the Zulema Street ﬁre and the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic shooting of
spring 2012. Surely, the personal risks and sacriﬁces theseﬁrst responders made weren’t for
a monthly paycheck, as the author suggests. Rather, I suspect they have much more generous
and altruistic motivations. - . a j . ' .. A I 2_

- Furthermore, the opinion that  in the city will somehow miraculously inspire civil

be  to ‘fautomatically become moré investedin the community’? is,~atits best, laughable,
- and at its worst, grossly underestimating the committnent these individuals already make to

ensure the public is safe. Given their clear dedication to the Pittsburgh community, I would
ask the editorial staff to rethink whether a police ofﬁcer who lives outside of the city is any less
inclined to stop a crime witnessed in South Oakland or whether ﬁreﬁghters really consider
an individual’s zip code when saving them from a burning building.

These brave men and women already do so much for the Pittsburgh community. Rather
than hastily demand more of them, we should respect the economic, educational and personal

_ reasons for which they and their families choose to live outside of city limits. It’s the least we

can do. ‘ »

Three Rivers Film Fes

Andrew Fishman
Stcyf Wrz’ter

Every ﬁlmmaker must start somewhere,
and for many, ﬁlm festivals are the best
way to get their start.

For ﬁlmmakers in the western Penn-
sylvania area, the Three Rivers Film Fes-
tival —- hosted here in Pittsburgh —~ has
been the largest and generally most suc-
cessful outlet for independent ﬁlms. The
32nd annual running of the Three Rivers
Film Festival begins this Friday, Nov. 8,
and runs through Nov. 23. The festival
will open with four ﬁlm screenings at
four different theaters that will be used
throughout the festival.

“There are so many different types of
ﬁlms being shown this year,” said Gern
Roberts, the senior graphic designer and
public relations representative of Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers, the festival’s largest
sponsor. “International ﬁlms, American

ﬁlms, independent ﬁlms ——l it’s really I
very exciting.”

Pittsburgh Filmmakers has sponsored
the Three Rivers Film Festival for every
year that it’s been running. Primarily a
school that teaches ﬁlmmaking, Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers strives to educate
the public about different types of ﬁlm
media. ’ _

“We allow people to have access to
digital, ﬁlm and photography media,”
said Roberts. “As far as theaters go, we
want to keep quality cinema available
to the public. We try and highlight lo-
cal ﬁlmmakers when we can. The ﬁlm
festival is a good sampling of what we
do throughout the year.”

One local ﬁlmmaker featured in the
festival this year is Steve Hoover, the
director of the documentary “Blood
Brother.” Hoover’s ﬁrst ﬁlm highlights
his friend Rocky Braat’s experience mov-
ing to India to work with a group of HIV-
positive orphans. According to Hoover,
the ﬁlm chronicles Rocky’s journey of
transitioning to Indian life, as well as
the encounters — both humorous and

tragic '— that occurred along the way.
“The kids are HIV—positive, so [Braat]
has been around a lot of serious illnesses,
been a part of deaths, he’s even personal-
ly helped bury some of the kids. He often
helps the children through family trauma
and things like that,” said Hoover, a Pitts-
burgh native who currently works for
local production company Animal. “I
would read [emails] about the things he
was doing and I had no connection with
it. When your close friend does some-
thing that drastic, you want to see what
he’s doing ﬁrsthand and understand what
it is that inspired him to move there.”
“Blood Brother” is just one of more
than 100 ﬁlms being shown over the next
few weeks at one of four theaters showing
ﬁlms for the festival — three of which
are Pittsburgh Filmmakers theaters. Lo-
cations and schedules can be found on
the festival’s website, 3rff.com. “Blood
Brother” will be shown on Nov. 16 at
4:30 p.m. at the Regent Square Theater.
Hoover will be present to conduct a Q-

tival exhibits broad swath of cinema

and—A session after the screening.

“This whole year, I’ve been going to
different festivals all over the world, and
it- made me think a lot about the Three
Rivers Film Festival,” said Hoover. “Be—
ing able to participate in something like
that in my home town —— it’s an honor.
And it’s exciting to share the ﬁlm with
Pittsburgh audiences.”

The fourth theater showing the fes-
tival’s ﬁlms this year is Waterworks Cin-
emas, a new sponsor of the Three Rivers
Film Festival. .

“Waterworks Cinemas has always
been interested in participating in com-
munity events,” saidjessica Levine, head
manager of the theater. “We have brought
other ﬁlm festivals into our theater, and
when the opportunity came to partner
with the Three Rivers, it was just an au-
tomatic ‘yes.’”

ﬁlms, the festival also offers ﬁlms featur-

‘Parlour Song’ preserves human element of despair

John Lavanga
A&J°E Editor

“Everything is disappearing.”

The succinct, disturbing statement es-
capes Ned’s mouth in a hushed tone -— part
panicked confession, part plea for help —
as Dale, Ned’s longtime friend and neigh-
bor, prepares to turn in after an innocuous
evening of swilling beers that verges on
becoming far too emotional.

The statement — and its implications
— lingers in the mind, not as a profound
existential observation, but as a fact. One
by one, each and every object he cared
about, from cuff links given to him by his
wife to a cricket bat from his youth, has
begun to vanish.

This is the crux of British dramatistjez
Butterworth’s play, “Parlour Song,” which
is being performed by the Quantum The-
atre company through Nov. 24. As Ned
(Cameron Knight), a demolition expert,
struggles to make sense of the sudden and
widespread disappearance of his things, he
is forced to contend with the much larger
disappearances in his life —— the loss of
intimacy with his bold, attractive wifejoy
(Sarah Silk) and any sense of internal bal-
ance that he might have once felt in his
mundane, middle-class existence.

The only person he can cling to is his
endlessly charismatic friend Dale (Brendan
McMahon), who, in spite of his supposed
stability, ﬁnds himself drawn into the blast

This is not to say that the play is all ers attempt to ignore the pressing issues

before them. Moreover, it’s the vacillation
between these instances of clever comedy
and darker undertones that make the ex-
istential panic of the play so meaningful.
With Vivid performances, thoughtfully

’ crafted direction and an ingenious use of

space and lighting, Quantum Theatre’s
rendition of the play palpably exposes the
strain created by holding up a happy facade
while the underpinnings of one’s life begin
to give way. .

most striking element of the performance.
On stage before the audience lies the en-

to the set, and the actors rarely leave.

When they are not literally present in
the scene, the actors are relegated to an-
other part of the stage, as though their
presence still hangs over the events tak-
ing place.

The effect of director Martin Giles’
decision to stage the play in this manner

On the night of the release of their spec-
tacular fourth album, Reﬂektor, Arcade Fire
played a special show via an MTV-owned
interactive marketing tool called “The Mu-
sic Experiment,” where bands play special
shows for crowds willing to follow a series
of clues via social media.

They performed on top of a Los Angeles
building while the ground-level crowd, aptly
dressed as reﬂectors, danced and reveled in
the exclusive experience. Midway through

the performance, the crowd started chant-
ing, “Come down!” — a request that front-
man Win Butler brushed off by diving right
into the silencing and infectious drumbeat
of The Suburbs’ standout track, “Sprawl.”

A Arcade Fire’s larger-than-life ethos is in-
grained in every move they’ve made in their
12-year career. From their early David Bowie
endorsement to the stadium-ready sound of
2004’s Funeral, the Grammy Award winners
have always been primarily concerned with
big, overarching questions. On Reﬂektor, the
questions are big, but accessible, making it
their most fully realized record to date —

which is saying a lot. .
The album starts with the dance-ready

single “Reﬂektor,” a seven-minute affair‘

that immediately sets the record apart from
the band’s previous releases. This depar-
ture partly comes from the addition of LCD
Soundsystem’s]ames Murphy at the produc-

existence, the type of question that religion
poses (ﬁtting, as Butler studied religion and
philosophy in college), and the type of ques-
tion that Butler and many others would say
isn’t being asked much anymore.

“I thought I found the connector./ It’s just
a reﬂector,” Butler howls on the title track.

The philosophical crux of the record
comes from a trip the band madeto Haiti,
the birthplace of Arcade Fire vocalist and
wife of Butler, Regine-Chassagne. Butler told
Rolling Stone that the experience altered his
way of perceiving the world. _

“There’s this whole inversion of society
that happens. For a lot of my friends and
people that I grew up with, the only time

‘ you ever really feel comfortable dancing is if

you’re with only your best friends and you’re
really drunk. You know what I mean — feel-
ing less of a break between the spirit and the
body, and sex and death notbeing completely
unrelated. [You] just kind of feel like a more
whole person, I guess,” he said in reference to
attending Haiti’s annual Carnival celebration.

tion for the release. As a double album, this

might be one of the last large-scale forays
into physical mediabefore online stream-
ing and downloadable content completely
alter the creative landscape (See: Youtube
Awards). Reﬂektor’s critique of the modern
age isn’t preachy, though -— it’s not even
particularly sad.

The album closes with “Afterlife” and

5 “Simple Symmetry,” two songs that, despite

questioning humanity’s innate capacity for
compassion, are actually quite hopeful. “I’ve
gotta know, can we work it out?/Just scream
and shout, till we work it out” Butler cries on
the album’s second—to—last track. A

The genuineness of the whole album
isstriking. Kierkegaard’s reﬂection posed
the idea that you derive your individuality
from imitating the people around you. For

I Kierkegaard, reﬂection is a leveling mecha-

- nism for generating your identity solely by
imitating others. In an age of ﬂashbulb eyes

capturing the minutiae of daily existence,
this critique is haunting, but The Reﬂek—
tors — Arcade Fire’s new touring moniker
—— aren’t fazed. They want their fans to look
up not at a reﬂection, but instead at the glar-
ing light of our mirrors being pointed in the
same direction.

The popular perception concerning American
cuisine in my home country of Britain often
gravitates toward certain adjectives. These
can include fatty, greasy, fried and just gen-

erally a bit excessive; Yet, in my mind, these ‘

aren’t necessarily all bad.
As a stiff-upper—lip Brit who has lived

under the doctrine of “everything in mod— '

eration” for most of my life, I waseager to
venture into the hedonistic world ofU.S. food.

I had always assumed that every pleasure-
ﬁlled, supersized meal came with a side—order

of guilt. But this was exactly the kind of guilt if
‘I wanted to experience. ‘ _
The ﬁrst stop on my Pittsburgh food od—_

yssey was locally acclaimed chain Primanti
Bros. It was a Friday evening and I was de-
sirous of greasy stodge: A pattering of taste
would have certainly been welcome, but not

necessary. Like any overly proud but com- - V

pletely ignorant tourist, I chose the ﬁrst item
that grabbed my attention, suitably named

the “Pittsburgher.” Iwatched the preparation ,

of what I swiftly discovered was a sandwich.
Though, this was unlike any sandwich I’d

seen before.

A Now in England, we have a rather mod—

est dish called a “chip butty,” also known as

fries in a sandwich. It’s cheap, cheerful and

simple — a homely meal that lacks imagina-

tion and any effort. So when I was presented -

with the mother of all “chip butties” on this
particular evening, I thought I had found my
new late—night—carb mecca. , -

With afew generous splashes of hot sauce,
I precariously and enthusiastically gorged on
my meal, as all the while fries, coleslaw, meat
and tomatoes tried to escape from between

,the two slices of bread in an effort to elude

myeager mouth. The majority of satisfac-
tion came from my merciless completion of
the thing. Yet, as I contemplated my seminal
venture into proper Pittsburgh dining, I began
to feel slightly cheap.

Sure, my craving was satisﬁed, but I felt
as though I’d just played my part in a loveless
affair. My British asceticism kicked in, and
as I sluggishly left Primanti Bros., I looked

cheese, for good measure.

Havingfound a seat, I commenced mind-
lessly staring at a baseball game, attempting
to comprehend — to no avail — what the
players were doing and why they were do-
ing it. . '

Fifteen minutes and a mountain of nap-
kins later, Iwas once again left to contemplate
whatl had just done. Ifeltallwrong and dirty,
both inside and out. My eager disregard for
any cutlery had resulted in an orange, sticky
residue varnishing the tips of my ﬁngers that
the napkins couldn’t remove. '

My mouth was slightly numbed by the
spice of the chicken wings and a sugary, salty
gloop coated my tongue. I observed that the
fries and macaroni and cheese were gone,
though I couldn’t recollect consuming them.
The only remnants were chicken bones and
an uncomfortable groaning from my gut. I
was left with the kind of guilt that makes you
consider leaving this Si1‘lfLllWOI‘lCl behind and
starting afresh as a monk.

It was a Sunday morning, and instead of
resting on the Sabbath like a good monk, I
ventured over to Squirrel Hill to, once again,
indulge myself on some more American eats,
this time at the highly—praised Pamela’s Diner.

I ordered “American” French toast with
sausages, a side of strawberries, a black cof-
fee and orange juice. As the amiable waitress
left, I retrieved mybook from my bag and
started to read, in an attempt to look both
intellectual and also nonchalant about being
in a diner by myselfon a Sunday morning. I
think I pulled it off. .

of gourmet decadence surrounding me and
the jolly diners, my patience waned and an
infantile enthusiasm took hold. Luckily, my
food swiftly arrived. Three generous chunks
of fried, egg-coated bread with a pile of sau-
sages and a bowl of rosy strawberries sat in
front of me. After discovering that the black
jug on my table contained syrup, I doused
the majority of my meal in the golden nectar,
knowing that this was common practice in
these parts. ’
Having learned my lessonfrom previ-
ous experiences, I decided to take my time.
I raised the ﬁrst forkﬁil to my mouth. An eb-
ullition of buttery, syrupy, sausagey delight
instantly took place. I was tasting things I
never knew were possible, and it overrode
all sense of self-loathing that my previous en-

deavours had produced. Once completed, I sat
back like a contented lord and sighed. When
the waitress collected my licked-clean plate
and asked me how everything was, I simply
grinned inanely and nodded. Sometimes,
words are not enough. ,
So, what have I learned? For a start, every
.restaurant table should supply syrup as a
necessary condiment — period. Also, and
more importantly, from my few experiences,
I’ve learned that indulgence is aﬁne line, and
there is anart to it that I have yet to master.
on the flipside, self-restraint can similarly
be both a virtue and a Vice: Pleasure is one
of life’s necessities, but not always neces-
sary. A balance is then required, and maybe

' I’ll replace my former British beliefs with

The subject of middle class ennui has been
explored ad nauseam by every playwright,

novelist, screenwriter and musician who.

has so much as glimpsed a white picket
fence. Butterworth is well aware of this con-
straint on his work, and he has delivered a
play that probes this ubiquitous suburban
loneliness while avoiding heavy-handed
admonishments of modern life.

His characters aren’t avant-garde.
They’re quietly and painﬁilly human. These
aren’t characters pulled from Jean-Paul
Sartre and dropped into a middle—class
British apartment —~ they don’t deliver
lengthy speeches about the philosophical
problems surrounding their lives. When,
over dinner, Ned —-— sporting a forced,

‘ nearly crazed smile — tells Joy about his

unnerving experience exploring an empty
development ﬁlled with houses exactly like
theirs, he notes that “it makes you think.”

After a‘ beat, Joy, already on her sec-
ond glass of wine, asks “About what?” The
manic grin melts away as he realizes that
he hasn’t the faintest idea what any of it
means. - -

It’s with this opacity that Butterworth
grounds the play and gives the power to
the performances — particularly Knight,
whose desperate, nervous and eerily chip-
per version of Ned will undoubtedly reso-
nate deeply with anyone who has witnessed
a loved one bear similar torments. Though
Butterworth gives us a glimpse of their in-
ternal life, we never see it all. This creates
immense humanity within the characters
-—- we may see the way they suffer, but we
will never fully understand why. ﬂ

The ﬁrst act of “The Dark World” is

awkward, there is an overreliance on vi-
sual effects and the always unnecessary

“darker” tone — a common trope of 21st
century superhero sequels — diminishes
the joyful buoyancy and humanity that
made the Kenneth Branagh- directed
predecessor so ﬁin, such as the effective
ﬁsh-out- of-water gags whenever Thor has
to adjust to common earthly situations.
However, at the turn of the second act,

the ﬁlm ﬁnds it footing. “Thor: The Dark

World” is satisﬁed enough in outdoing —
or, at the very least, out—hammer—throwing
j—-—.the original, instead of desperately
straining to meet the grandeur of “The

,.

Avengers.” The ﬁlm manages to carve out
its own identity, and that’s what makes
this another Marvel success.

All outside references and fan-teasing
cameos aside, “The Dark World” (mostly
in the latter half of the ﬁlm) utilizes the
subtle humor, superb visuals and rollick-
ing sense of amusement that worked so
well 2 1/2 years ago, only this time weaving
on a grander scale, with more interesting
villains and a dizzyingly intricate climax.

At the very least, Marvel has proven
that despite the soaring standards of “The
Avengers,” reverting back to creating soli-
tarysuperhero ﬁlms is not a disappointing
comedown. Rather, with features as crisp
and exciting as “Thor: The Dark World,”
Marvel proceeds to retain its remarkable

son. He remedied this problem by watching
a lot of French television with the subtitles
turned on, an easy task for a single man in
an unfamiliar land.

His familiarity with another romance
language, Spanish (his ﬁrst language as a
Dominican-American), also helped.

Fast forward to the present, and he’s able
to converse with fans after games while ex-
changing customary pecks on the cheeks. He
can also speak to his French coaches, team
staff and teammates in their native tongue,
and he can interact with autograph seekers
he comes across in public.

’ But that trilingual ability is of little help
at the moment.

It’s a bit after 2 p.m. on a Saturday, and
the store is shuttered with no signs of life evi-
dent, despite the listed openingtime having
passed and a reservation set for 2:30 p.m. No
one is picking up when Greer calls the phone
number on the side of the building. His son
and his son’s friend run around the mostly
empty parking lot before going inside the
adjacent toy store.

This isn’t the only task Greer has today.
Strasbourg Illkirch.-Graffenstaden Basket,
better known as SIG Basket, has practice
at 4 p.m.

This is life for Greer now: balancing rais-
ing a family with a professional basketball
career. This is a reality he’s comfortable with.

Playing the game

In a Euroleague game the night before
against Anadolu Efes Istanbul, Greer started
and displayed the versatility he is known for.
He compiled 10 points, ﬁve assists and four
rebounds in 30 minutes whﬂe splitting his
time down low, beyond the 3-point line (he
shot 2-for-2 from distance) and everywhere
in between.

Greer, who attended Pitt from 1997 to
2001, is seventh on the school’s all-time scor-
ing list, seventh in ﬁeld goals made, sixth
in rebounds, 12th in assists, ﬁfth in steals,
the program’s all—time leader in offensive
rebounds and one of only seven four-year
starters in the men’s team’s history.

Under coach Ben Howland, Greer helped
lead the school into its current era of suc-
cess. His senior year, Pitt made the Big East

championship game and went to the NI'I‘
Sweet Sixteen.

The next year, the streak of 10 straight
NCAA Tournament appearances began.

As both the oldest active player in Pro-A
and one of the longest tenured, Greer is av-
eraging7.6 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists
and 2.4 turnovers in 25.8 minutes per game.
While in the Euroleague, his stats amount to
24.7 minutes, 7.3 points, 3 turnovers and 4.3
assists and rebounds per game.

At the moment, SIG Basket occupies ﬁfth
place out of 16 teams in Pro A with a record of
3-2. The team is in last place in its Euroleague
group, failing to win one of the three games
it has played.

-While Greer says he hasn’t acquired a
taste for the national cuisine and has a rota-

« tion of four or ﬁve restaurants to which he

sticks, he’s happy with his life in Europe.

“I’ve been here for 12 years. I’ve had great
experiences, met great people, started afam-
ily,” Greer said. “At the end of the day, the
NBA is great, but Europe is great, also. Not
too many people can say they can leave col-
lege and make ‘)_{’a1nount of money just out
of college.”

He has enjoyed the experience of living
in France, but his Australian wife is “not a
big fan” to hear Greer say so. Both his son
and younger daughter were born here, go to
school here and speak the language ﬂuently
in addition to Spanish and English.

“Now, as they get older, it’s a little harder
because they’re more wanting to stay in the
States,” Greer, who lives in Orlando dur-

S Florida State
continues to

dominate ACC

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬂ Wrz'ter

All eyes were on Tallahassee last week, and
No. 3 Florida State didn’t disappoint. Despite
struggles against No. 7 Miami, the Seminoles
had a big second half to secure their 41-14
victory over their in-state rival.

The win bumped the clear ACC favorite to
No. 2 in the BCS standings. With undefeated
Oregon and Ohio State directly behind FSU
in the standings, the Seminoles need to con-
tinue racking up style points in their ﬁnal four
games.

Meanwhile, Pitt fell further down the lad-
der by way of its 21-10 loss to Georgia Tech
on Saturday.

Here’s this week’s ACC Breakdown:

1. No. 2 Florida State (8-0, 6-0 ACC)

Twenty unanswered second-half points
gave FSUacomfortable victory. The Seminoles
have been known to blow winnable games,
and they will need to remain focused down
the stretch against opponents who are far less
talented than they are.

2. No. 7 Clemson (8-1, 6-1 ACC)

The Clemson offense is back to its usual

ways, scoring a combined 99 points in the

past two games. The Tigers easily disposed of
Virginiainasg-10 win. While Clemson doesn’t
have much of a chance at winning the ACC
championship because it’s in FSU’s confer-
ence, an 11-1 season could still land the Tigers
in a BCS bowl.
3. No. 11 Miami (7-1, 3-1 ACC)
Losing to FSU was nothing to be ashamed
of for Miami. The Hurricanes showed they
were taking on water after they needed last-
minute drives to beat North Carolina and Wake
Forest. What hurts the most about the loss to
the Seminoles is that star running back Duke
Johnson broke his ankle and will miss the rest
of the year. Miami could still earn a rematch
with FSU inthe ACC title championship. With-
outjohnson, thatfeat is a lot more challenging.

BASKETBALL

ing the offseason, said. “But as my career’s
ending, it’s a perfect situation where soon
they’ll be able to go to school in the States
and it’ll be done.”

Greer wants to pursue a career coaching
when his time playing ends, which is some-
thing former Pitt teammate Brandin Knight
has done as an assistant at their alma mater.

Another ’90s era Pitt player, Orlando
Antigua, preceded Knight in that role. An-
tigua currently works under John Calipari
at Kentucky and is the head coach of the
Dominican Republic national team. Greer,
who returned to the squad after a four—year
hiatus to play for Antigua this past summer,
has plans to serve on his staff at the FIBA Bas-
ketball World Cup in Spain this coming year.

But all that’s in the ﬁiture.

In the present, he’s at the point where
the contracts that used to be two to three
years in length, long for Americans playing
in Europe and a reﬂection of his reputation
and longevity in Pro A, have reverted back
to one—year deals. It’s an issue Antigua is
familiar with.

“Some guys retire or leavejthe overseas
contract because they can’t get adjusted to
being 10 months out of the year outside the
U.S.” Antigua said. “Or they’re having dif-
ﬁculties dealing with the culture, and the
atmosphere, and the demands of what a
contract requires overseas: two—a—day prac-
tices for over two months and playing only
once or twice a week.”

“You’ve got to have a certain mental
makeup and certain personality to be able
to deal with that and succeed and thrive,”
he added.

Greer seems to have that mental makeup,

{Na

» lAll.~()l7~l’l\Ml:a.

as he’s come a long way since a stint with the
London Towers 10 years ago, during which
monthly salaries were handed to him and his

' teammates all in cash before practice. This

arrangement made Greer so uncomfortable
that he demanded they bring his payments
to where he lived or else pay by some other
method.

A long road .

So how did a man from Washington
Heights in New York come to spend almost
all of his working life in France?

Early on, there were no indications that
he would. His ﬁrst season in the country
and second as a professional — 2002-2003
playing for STB Le Havre in Le Havre, France
.— ended before the new year when he tore
a calf muscle. V — j

Two seasons later, he would come back
to France.

Much of the credit for why he returned,

as Greer explains it, lies with his brotherjeff -

Greer, who is two years younger.

“My brother was here,” Ricardo Greer
said, “It was just an experience where you
can’t pass that up to play with your younger
brother. We played against each other in
college. He went to Rutgers. Then when we
came to Europe our ﬁrst year, played against
each other and then six years we played
with each other and won championships
together.” .

“You can’t pass that up for anything. I
don’t care what anybody says, if you have a
chance to play with your sibling and experi-
ence Europe with them and your families
together, that’s a dream come true to me,”
he said.

After that season in London, he joined
Jeff at BCM Gravelines-Dunkerque in Grav-
elines, France. They would link up twice
more: for three years in Nancy, France, and
two in Strasbourg. Last year— the pair’s last

time playing together — Strasbourg was a
ﬁnalist in the playoffs and a ﬁnalist in a cup
competition. '

The ﬁrst team Ricardo Greer played for
in Europe was BC Kyiv in 2001. .

“It was just a shellshock to me, coming
from college. In college, you’re taken care
of, you’ve got your old surroundings, you
feel great,” Greer said. “[And then] it’s not
ﬁm no more. It’s a job. You have three, four,
ﬁve bad games, they send you home. In col-
lege, you have four years to play basketball.
It was tough.” _

For Greer, the adjustmentwas made more
difﬁcult by the fact that he knew no one and
he had just one American, English-speaking
teammate, fellow rookie Anthony Evans
from the University of Georgia.

That season would also be memorable

V for not getting paid what he was due by the

team. A problem he has never experienced
in France. .

His only prior time in Europe before be-
comingapro came in 1995, when he traveled
to France for a tournament as a member of
the Gauchos, a renowned New York Amateur
Athletic Union organization. On that trip,
former NBA player Stephon Marbury was
his roommate.

Much of what helped pull Ricardo I
through these difficult experiences early"

on was a sense of duty to provide for his
family back home. _g

“That was my biggest thing: I’m making
money now. I don’t care where the hell I’m
at.” Greer said. “I’m gonna make a point to
stick and to continue to do what I have to do.”

That bullishness has allowed him to enjoy
the good times and move beyond the few
unfavorable circumstances in which hehas
found himself. ' '

“I’ve loved it. I might be in different ideal
situations because I’ve always had a good
coach and a good situation. But at theend of
the day, home is where you make it.” Greer
said. “It’s not always about ‘Oh, I gotta be in
the perfect situation. I gotta do this, I gotta
do that. If you just think, ‘This is what I have
to do to get myself right,’ you’re good, man.”

The fascination held by most male pro-
fessional basketball players of reaching
the NBA, while understandable, can work
against them abroad.

“A lot of these young kids come over here
and think ‘Oh, Europe. Oh, I need to get back
to the league. This is my way back to the
league.’ If that’s your mindset — you’re using

this [solely] to get back to the NBA — That’s -

not gonna happen,” Greer explained.
This wisdom mirrors what Antigua want-

ed to make clear to Greer when he was just .

starting out abroad.

“You’ve got to try to take advantage of the
opportunities that are in front of you. We all
had dreams and aspirations of trying to make
it to the NBA. He would’ve been one of those
fringe, borderline guys that could’ve had an
NBA career, and forwhatever reason it didn’t
come about,” Antigua said in a phone inter-
view. “He had the opportunity to go overseas,
and he’s maximizedjthat opportunity there.”

' For the other year spent away from .

France, Greer relocated across the English
Channel to play forthe now-defunc_t London
Towers from 2003 to 2004 —- a time notable
for the fact that he met his wife there.

In 2010, he also spent about 10 days in
Croatia as a member of KK Zadar before a
disagreement with then-head-coach Daniel
jusup signaled the need to ﬁnd a more ami-
able situation as soon as possible.

“It was a bad experience because I had
my wife and my kids there,” Greer explained.

That was the only other negative from
his time abroad, Greer mentioned. And it
quickly became a positive when he signed to
return to Strasbourg on the same day they
began negotiations. His brother signed with
the team the next season. .

Ricardo Greer has adjusted well to life in
France, thanks in part to the environment
he entered in Le Havre.

“I was blessed to come to France when I
came because I had a great bunch of older
guys that took me under their wing and
helped me out tremendously,” Greer said.

The setup wouldn’t last because of that

' unfortunate injury.

But the impressions those and othervet-

erans made and the lessons learned from

them over the years are evident now, as he

attempts to continue the cycle and help the ~
next bunch of American expats trying to .

make it in the same way.

A It’s a process based in cultural adjustment
revolving ‘around two often—intersecting
themes: basketball and life.

“As I got older, all I try to do is help these .

young guys understand you can score 25

points — your team loses, you’re not gonna »

get that job you’re expecting to get cause
you’re a loser,” he said. “It’s all about winning
in Europe. At the end of the day, you win,
you’re part of a team that wins champion-
ships, contracts will keep coming in.”
