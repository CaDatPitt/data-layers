problems
eliminate
positions

Byjennifer M. Calabrese

Budget constraints have

recently pushed the Office of
Facilities Management to
eliminate six supervisory
positions, forcing people who
had once been managers to work
as custodians.

“Six supervisory positions in
the janitorial operation were
eliminated, and those folks were
given the opportunity to take a
position in the custodial
department so that they would
not lose. Of course they would
still be employed, and they would
not lose their benefits,” said
Thomas Hussey, director of
facilities management.

“These are very difficult times.
People are worried aboutwhether
they are going to be able to keep
their jobs. We have spent a lot of
time with folks, reassuring them
that in fact, these adjustments
that we are making put us in a
better position to do a better job
for the university and to be better
stewards of funds that are
available,” Hussey said.

Hussey said that elimination of
the six positions was part of a
general reduction of the FM force.

“We were forced in order to
make at more cost—effective
operation [..l We were forced to
make some hard decisions. It
was taken care of according to
seniority. They did come out of
union ranks, and the union agreed
that they could go back into the
custodial force,” Hussey said.

Hussey, who said that it was
primarily his decision to cut out
the positions, stressed that the six
workers were not demoted.

“Those six people are excellent.

people that we hope some time
in the future, as supervisory
positions open, that we will be
able to draw them back into the
supervisory staff,” he said.

The cutbacks have also hit
students who work as custodians,
such as Willa Martin, a liberal-
studies major. Martin learned last
week that her work hours would
be cutback from 20 hours a week
to 16.

“Maybe they think that for all of
us this is some job to earn extra
money to buy clothes or
something. I pay my bills with
this job. And when they take 60
[dollars] a month from me just
like that, that translates into a bus
pass and my phone bill or two

As part of the ongoing homecoming-week
events at Pitt, students were able to blast
enemy jets, tackle linemen, solve puzzles
and transform Michael Jackson into a mighty
robot that rescues children.

The Genesis Video Games College

sponsored by Sega and co—sponsored at Pitt
by the Pitt Program Council.

This nationwide tour involves college
students in schools with over 10,000 students
in 60 major cities across the United States.

“The purpose of this is, of course, to get
Sega known to the college crowd About 60
percent of Nintendo [Owners have] already
traded [their games] to Sega,” said Chris
Broom, master of ceremonies for this event.

Among the games that students were able
to play over the past two days were Michael
Jackson’s Moonwalker, Columns, Monaco
GP, Afterburner II and Tommy LaSorda’s

Baseball.

Sega games have received awards for
Game of the Year and Game of the Month by
Electronic GamesM0ntbly. Broom said that
two new games, James “Buster” Douglas
Knockout Boxing and Joe Montana Football,
will be out in the next two months.

According to Pete McClure, recreation
director for the PPC, Sega representatives
asked Pitt if it would accept this tournament

had a meter price increase in seven years,” said Larkin.“  J ’

Larkin doesn’t think the price increase will hurt business, even ,
though no other cab company has decided to raise their prices. .

But some students disagree, especially since Yellowcab doesn’t

give special rates to students.

Doug Whiting, a freshman at Pitt, thinks the price increase
from $1 to $1.70 is a big jump. “It cost me $1.80 to go from
Dithridge Street to thefowers, and with this new price increase

it will cost me almost that much just to get in the cab,” Whiting.

Minority students learn
ins and outs of interviews

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News

Lorie Johnson, now a family—
life educator for the YWCA,
remembers her anxieties about
graduating from college and going
on job interviews.

“I was happy to be graduating,
but then there was that fear, too,”
she said.

Johnson spoke to minority
students about interviewing skills
Monday night as part of the
Minority Jobs Fair in the William
Pitt Union, sponsored by the Black
Action Society and the National
Society os Black Engineers.

Johnson provided students with
interviewing tips and played a
cassette tape which highlighted
the good and bad points of one
individual’s job interview.

There are three types of job
interviews, according toJohnson.

“The sequential interview is
probably a screening process,”
she said.

If a company conducts a
sequential interview, “there are
probably 20 people with good
resumes, and they are trying to
weed them out,” she said.

In the serial interview, “if the
manager likes you, the next day
he might introduce you to his
superior,” she said.

In a panel interview, a group of
prospective employers “all sit
around a table and ask you
questions," she said.

All three types of interviews
can be further broken down into
structured, unstructured and
problem—solving interviews, she

coordinators “thought this would
be a good thing to promote
homecoming spirit."

"Our general rule is to promote
this event on campus and man
the event," McClure said. He
added, “Response yesterday was
really good. The idea was for
everyone to come back today for
the qualifying round, [but student
response was] not as high as [it
was] yesterday," McClure said.

Students who competed in the
tournament played two games,
Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker
and Columns, for three minutes
apiece. The top 36 students from
this round competed in the
quarterfinals for a chance to move
on to the ﬁnal rounds of the
competition.

Each of the 36 finalists received
free T—shirts and Burger King
coupons. The top 12 finalists then
played Moonwalker for five
minutes, Revenge of Shinobi for
four minutes and Ghouls ‘N
Ghosts for four minutes.

A day of rappelling and military
training awaited the Pitt Army

a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps

Panther Battalion and I as we
stood in front of the Stephen
Foster Memorial at 6 a.m. last
Saturday, preparing to leave for
Camp Dawson, W. Va.

After a two and a half hour bus
trip, the cadre (or ROTC
instructors) and approximately

‘ 100 cadets (along witha sleepy

7-?

photographer and myself)
disembarked at Camp Dawson,
the headquarters of the West
Virginia National Guard, amid
clean air and trees in their autumn
glory.

Half of the cadets went to the
five training stations and the other
half went to rappel, which
involves bounding backwards
down a cliff while hooked to a
rope. The cadets at the cliff were
joined by junior ROTC cadets
from Oliver High School.

yelled. When he reached the
ground, he reiterated the safety
«precautions that the cadets had
been taught during the past week.

“The purpose of this training is
for you to overcome your mind’s
limitations,” said Geoghagan to
the cadets assembled at the
bottom of the cliff. “Nobody in
their right mind looks over a 65-

_ foot cliff and thinks this is fun.

You will be scared. If you’re not
scared, you’re  dumb. You
cannot get hurt unless you do it
to yourself. The exercise today is
to prepare your mind" to accept
the impossible and do it. And you
will be able to do it.”

Before the cadets rappelled,
Geoghagan coached a mock-
reluctant Capt. Robert Pike down
the cliff. In a terrific burst of
improvisational acting, Pike
pretended to be terrified of
rappelling: “NO! I can’t do it!” he
screamed. He let go of the rope
and hung upside down to
demonstrate how hard it is to fall
while rappelling. Pike timidly

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

Cadets received ﬁnal safety instructions before going over the edge’.

“Do you have to do a report on
this?” many of the JROTC cadets
asked me while I was scrawling
comments in my notebook.

Lt. Col. Michael Geoghagan,
professor of military science, was
the first person to rappel down
the cliff. “God, I love this!” he

bounded down the cliff to safety
amid the laughter of the cadets.
“Red Rover, Red Rover, send
Pitt News right over!” bellowed
Geoghagan from the top of the
cliff. Thenl knew I was in trouble.
I was going to have to rappel. It’s
about courage, I reminded myself.

It’s about appearing worthwhile
to yourself.

Cadet 1st Lt. Jeffrey Pannaman
helped us tie a Swiss seat, a rope
which is wound and knotted
around the waist and the upper
legs. A D—ring is attached through
the Swiss seat, and the ring is
hooked to the rope which leads
from the top to the bottom of the
cliff.

Safety was accentuated — no
less than -three officers or
experienced cadets checked the
Swiss seats to make sure they
were tied correctly. Everyone who
rappelled wore gloves and a
helmet. An officer was stationed
by each rope on the top of the
cliff, and a senior cadet was on
belay at the bottom to stop any
out-of-control cadet from falling.

I am terrified of heights —
bordering on a neurosis. A trip to
the 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning often leaves me sick
with visions of my body hurtling
to the ground. Struggling against
great fear, I stood at the edge of
the cliff while Capt. Thomas
Donaldson coached me down
the side. I didn’t exactly bound;
rather, I walked down the cliff
face. But when I hit the ground,
I wanted to do it again. And I did,
reaching the ground in 10 or so
little bounds the second time. I
felt as if I had conquered
something.

“I’ve rappelled about 40 times,
but each time I go off the cliff, I’m
scared. I’m afraid of heights. But
it builds your confidence. That’s
what a lot of things in the Army
do: build your confidence,” said
Cadet Sgt. Eric Stambol.

“I love rappelling, but it’s harder
than it looks. It’s hard to get a
footing [on the clifﬂ,” said Cadet
Sgt. Sharon Debbage. A

“Rappelling fills me with a sense
of excitement," said Cadet Capt.

Alan Lang. I I

After that brief ﬂirtation with

destiny, I headed out to the’

training stations. Cadet Maj. Carl
Henderson introduced me to the
“John Rambo Memorial IMT
Course,” where cadets learned
Individual Movement Techniques
such as low and high crawls. “We
just don’t want [the cadets] to sit
in a classroom [and learn]. We
want them to actually use [these
maneuversl,” he said.

“Come on! That’s it! Good
technique!" Henderson yelled to
a cadet low-crawling with his M-
16 through the mud. ’

Next I visited the rope-bridge
station, where the cadets and I
learned how to cross a danger
area by securing a rope to a tree
at each side of the obstacle. We
hooked our D-rings to the rope
and slid backwards to the other
side.

BAS members encouraged to ‘never be too busy to be black’

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, October 10, 1990

 

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News

Black Action Society Chairperson Doug
Ligons has encouraged black students at
Pitt to remember this year’s BAS slogan.

“You're never too busy to be black,”
said Ligons at this year’s Indaba, an annual
Get Acquainted Weekend activity.

Although Get Acquainted Weekend
activities drew a large turnout this year,
former BAS steering-comrnittee members
have expressed concern that many of
Pitt's BAS members fail to participate in
committee work. I

At the Indaba, Ligons addressed this
concern and encouraged black students
to participate in BAS committee activities
as well as social events.

Ligons said that current student
participation “is pretty much the same as
last year.”

“The students are still waiting to see
some progress before they come out in
larger numbers,” he said.

Ligons said that throughout the school

year, the BAS will probably draw enough —

students to complete all of the projects the
group is planning.
Participation has been very good on the

Black Active Students Intercollegiate
Struggle committee this year, according to
BASICS Chairperson Marcus Guy.
According to Guy, 16 to 25 students
have joined the committee.
“If you have that many people, it’s hard
to keep people busy,” he said.
Community outreach committee
Chairperson Michelle Martin agreed.
“The more growth you have, the harder
it is to keep people busy,” she said.‘
Martin said approximately 15 students
have joined her committee.
“Community outreach is a new
committee, and we’re basically forming,”

she said. “We’re getting together programs
for the [areal high—school students."

The project is “sort of a mentoring
program,” according to Martin, geared
speciﬁcally to those ninth- and 10th-grade
students who are not planning to go to

college and are holding a quality—point A '

average of 2.5 and below.

Community Outreach is also planning a
Scholastic Aptitude Test workshop for
high—school students, she said.

Guy was on the political—action
committee last year and said that student
participation was basically the same as
that of this year’s BASICS committee.

I _ In a structured interview an

interviewer might have a list of
questions for the interviewee to
answer, according to Johnson.
“There are certain things they
need to find out, and they ask

every single person they interview

all of the questions.”
In unstructured interviews,
“they talk to you one—on-one and

get to know who you are,” she
said.

The problem-solving interview
is rarer, she said.

“They invite you in and give
you a problem to solve, and you
have to come up with the solution
that day,” she said.

As an example of the problem-
solving interview, Johnson cited
her interview with a newspaper,
in which the interviewer asked

her to write an article.

The first step in job interviewing
is to gather information about the
company you are interviewing
with, she said.

“Go to the library. That
information is there,” she said.

The second step in interviewing
is to, get the name and title of the
person who will interview you.
You will want to send the
interviewer a thank—you note later,

she said.

“Ask the person who is making
the interview arrange merits if you
need to take anything with you to
the interview,” she said.

Johnson said the company
might need another copy of your
resume or your college transcripts.

In preparation for the interview,
Johnson also suggested
performing a “personal-
afﬁrmation exercise.”

“If you feel nervous, you might
give those negative impressions
to the interviewer,” she said.

Johnson said, “ITell] Yourself
things like, ‘I am the best person
for the job,’ ‘people like me’ and
‘I will make a good impression in
the interview.”

Going into the actual interview,
Johnson said:

0 Avoid wearing gaudy jewelry.

-Arrive on time and alone. _

0 Remove your outer garments
(such as your coat or sunglasses)
in the outer lobby and leave them
there.

-Make eye contact.

0 Never smoke or ask to smoke,
even if the interviewer is smoking.

-Sit on the side of the
interviewer that makes you feel
most comfortable.

0Avoid looking at the papers

V on an interviewer’s desk.

During the interview, “turn that
negative into a success,” she said.

If you failed a class in college,
for example, “tell the interviewer
what you gained from the
experience," she said. “Later on I
was able to get a B in the class,
and I’m proud of that,” would be
an appropriate response, she said.

“Never talk negatively of your
former employer," she said. “They

won't look on that favorably.”

“Don’t interrupt the
interviewer,” she said.
It is important that the

interviewer realizes that the two
of you are in sync, she said.

“Try to listen and tailor your
answers to the questions that
they ask,” she said. '

Certain questions, such as those
inquiring about your age, race,
religion or ethnic origin, are illegal
for an interviewer to ask a
prospective employer, she said.

“Those are things they are not
supposed to discuss,” she said.

_But if a prospective employer
asks thesequestions, “you should
answer them if you want the job,”
she said. .

“You shouldn’t tell the
interviewee that you know his
questions are illegal,” she said.

“This is not the time to display
your knowledge or anger,” she
said.

“Don’t get into salary at your
first interview. Wait until they call
you back,” she said. “That’s the
time to discuss salary, benefits
and perks.”

If an interviewer pressures you
into discussing the topic, Johnson
suggested, “a salary relative to
the work I willbe doing” as an
appropriate response.

At the end of the interview,
Johnson suggested asking follow-
up questions such as, “When can
I expect to hear from you again?”
or “What will the next step be?”

. Johnson said you should end
every interview by projecting your
staying power.

She suggested comments such
as “I'm looking forward to
working with you.”

noticed one of her students
smoking, a practice which is
beginning to be highly
discouraged in the military.
Ertman conﬁscated his cigarette
andextinguisheditonhertongue.

“I learned how to do that in
college,” she said.

Ertman is a role model for many
of the cadets in the Panther
Battalion, according to many
cadets. “She's great," said Cadet
Lt. Col. Carlos Henderson, the
battalion commander. “She shows
that women can be hardcore
[serious about the military], too."

After a lunch of Army field
rations, or MRES [Meals Ready to
Eat with, miraculously enough, a
shelf life of 10 years], the cadets
who hadrappelled visited the
training stations and vice versa.
The battalion arrived back in
Oakland around 1930 hours

Of course, this article wouldn't
be complete without the retelling
of one of Geoghagan’s West
Virginia jokes:

A West Virginia boy is walking
down the road with a pig under
his arm, when a second West
Virginia boy passes him.

“Hey, where’d you get that?”
the second boy asks.

“Oh, I won him in a rafﬂe,” said
the pig.

“Maybe they will change their minds,
but somehow I doubt it. I don’t think that

The budget constraints have affected

to Hussey.

able to perform a certain task as rapidly as

Hussey said that the decision to eliminate
the positions may have improved FM
somewhat. ‘

“You could make a case that the transfer
of the six individuals from the eliminated
positions in the supervisory area into the
custodial area actually improved our ability
to produce a service,” he said.

The FM budget is approximately $28
million. Hussey said that it was an increase
in costs, rather than a cut in the money

received, that has caused the cutbacks.

“Five years ago our hazardous-waste

amounted to $1,300,000 —- an $800,000
increase. So as you begin to take and
assign your monies to the extended areas

actual budget reduction to end up with

Four other people in supervisory
positions have recently been put on

probation.

“That situation is not connected,” Hussey
said. “That is between those individuals
and their supervisors; that isn’t something
that should be talked about.”

“The review of supervisors and their

those supervisors who are asked to improve
their performance is a separate review
from anything else,” he said.

Supervisors demoted...

When a company forces an employee to step down to ’

anlinferior working position and take a severe wage cut,
it is usually referred to as a demotion. In Pitt’s facilities-
rnanagement department, however, it is considered to be
a favor.

Because of financial constraints, facilities management
has had to eliminate six supervisory positions. For this
reason, the six people who had held these positions were
“given the opportunity” to take custodial jobs.

The six people who had their jobs eliminated were
originally custodians. Four years ago they were given
supervisory positions, meaning that they would make
surethat custodial work was being done. Now, however,
they are being returned to their old jobs.

L. Thomas Hussey, director of facilities management,
says that these people could “... take a position in the
custodial department so that they would not lose [their
jobs].” Hussey refuses to admit that these replacement
jobs are, in fact, demotions.

In effect, Hussey is saying that, by giving these six
people their old jobs back, that the university is doing
them a favor by keeping them. Meanwhile, these people
are taking severe pay cuts by accepting this “favor.”

Furthermore, four other people currently holding
supervisory positions were recently placed on probation

' for not doing their jobs. Yet these people are retaining

their jobs while these six, who had adequate performance
records, were demoted to janitorial status.

Hussey claims that, by sending these six people back
into the working branch, facilities management will
actually improve. Unfortunately, there will now be fewer
supervisors over more custodians, so there will not be
enough people around to make sure that the work is
getting done.

Also, the supervisors who have been left in their
positions have been reprimanded for inadequate
performance. If they cannot even complete their own
jobs, there is no reason to believe that they will be able
to sufficiently watch the custodians.

L. Thomas Hussey says that the problem with the
supervisors on probation “isn’t something that should be
talked about.” However, this should be the main topic of
discussion.

Hussey’s contradictory position of holding inadequate
supervisors while demoting others with better work
records looks to be a colossal blunder in services to be
rendered.

As Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for
Women, declared a national
emergency week as a result of
David Souter’s nomination for
Supreme Court justice, tension
grows between pro—choice
activists and, as I see it, anti-
choice activists.

Of all the world’s problems —
famine, the homeless, rape,
murder and possible war —— the
people of this nation are fighting
each other over the issue of
abortion. To me this is outrageous.
Women are ﬁghting each other
over the question “Do we have
the right to choose what to do
with our lives and our bodies?”

Women (some of them) are giving ‘

up this right. They are saying,
“We don’t have the right to choose
how we want our lives to be. Let
someone else choose for us. We
don’t want the right to choose.”

Do these “anti—choicers” realize
what would happen in this
democratic country if Roe vs.
Wade was to be overturned?
Children would be put into the
world unwanted, unloved, and
uncared for. This may possibly
create more child abuse. We all
know there’s enough of that in
the country. Unwanted children
of financially unstable parents
would end up in malnutrition.
Do we want this? More children
would end up homeless in the
streets. I feel this can be avoided
and hopefully we know how.

People are not saying that
women have to get an abortion
sometime in their lives. It is said
that we have that right to choose
whether to get an abortion or not

after them and say that [the logo]

It may be of some interest to
the university to learn that there

favorite, a Pitt Chemical and
Sanitary Supply Co. There is one
company that operates in the
East End that uses the blue-script
logo of the athletic teams on the
sides of their trucks. I decline to
name them, fearing that they too
may be dealt a lawsuit.

The point is that Pitt acts solely
in its own interests, and it is my
belief that they are attempting to
force Mr. Bonasorte out of
business so that they will attain a
monopoly of the Pitt-licensed
paraphernalia available in the
area. Their I store charges
outrageous prices for the same
sweatshirts, which makes their
other comments of Oct. 3, that
“... the alleged trademark
infringement by Bonasorte is a
threat to Pitt students. This is a
very important matter to [both
Pitt and its students]. It’s [Pitt’sl
name, and we want to protect it
and [the studentsl," all the more
nauseating and insulting.

Campoli an excellent choice

I do not know (either in terms
of precedent or intrinsic merit)
whether the process of
appointment or election to select
the undergraduate representative
on the search committee to select
candidates for the presidency of
Pitt is preferable. Having taught
Ms. Lisa Campoli in the American
experience seminar series for
executives, I can say, however,
that I have seldom seen someone
in her category and at her age
conduct herself with more poise
and maturity in a group in which
most of the members carry major
responsibility in the private and
public sectors. Ms. Campoli
contributed to the discussions in
a manner that made a positive
difference. She was neither
precocious nor intimidated, but
rather simply, calmly and
consistently thoughtful. I was
particularly impressed by the
manner in which she allowed the
free and disintered [sic] play of
her attention focus on a problem
before giving a tentative opinion
on the matter at hand. She was
fair as well as incisive in her
contributions to the discussion.
In terms of attitude, ability and
capacity for growth, she held her
own in a management group that
ranged in scale from the middle
to upper levels of responsibility.
Iwas, and still remain, impressed
with the disinterested, non-
partisan manner in which she
addressed problems that were
deliberately posed in a way to
evoke strong opinions. [..] In
short, she has as open a mind and
as balanced a judgment as anyone
could. possibly request. That, plus
her obvious intelligence and deep
sense of responsibility, makes
her an excellent choice as the
undergraduate representative on
that committee. [...]

I locker room recently.

It was also a good thing that
Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam
Wyche barred a woman reporter
from his locker room after the
Bengals’ loss to Seattle in the
Kingdome.

Don’t get me wrong — I’m all
for women in the sportswriting
field, but these two incidents
have clearly demonstrated the
need for a new all-encompassing
NFL locker-room policy.

Locker rooms should be closed
to the media —- men and women.

The University of Pittsburgh
has that exact policy for its football
and basketball teams. No one is
allowed in the locker room after
the game. Members of the media
are directed to a designated post-
game conference site where the
head coach is available as well as
a few key players from the day’s
game. And reporters are free to
talk to whomever they wish.

Pitt’s football locker room
closed at the beginning of the

1988 season because Mike
Gottfried was displeased with the
media. Paul Evans has never
allowed anyone into the
basketball locker room because
of his personal feelings about the
locker room being a private place
for the team.

And a private place it should
be.

From coverin g the Steelers this
year, I have been in their locker
room many times and opponents’
locker rooms on occasion.
Players are busy being treated
for injuries, getting tape cut off,
getting undressed, taking
showers, and yes, walking
around in the raw while trying to
get dressed and leave.

All the while, there are
countless television and
newspaper reporters sticking
microphones and tape recorders
in players’ faces while they are in.
one of the aforementioned stages
of post—game rituals.

So the argument is, why can’t
these players wait a while to get
undressed to accommodate the
media’s needs (especially
women’s)? After all, it is in each
team’s best interest for public

relations to have their players on
television or in the papers.

barrier, and recently we have
come to see the kinds of problems
this can cause. These problems
obviously do not originate with
female reporters, but it appears
that members of football teams
still have a slight uneasiness with
the situation.

After all, how often do you
guys walk around naked in front
of some woman you do not know
or know on a solely professional
basis? Never is my guess, unless
you’re into ﬂashing.

But that is only one part of the
overall problem. Again, when
reporters enter a locker room, it
is an unwritten privilege. “No it’s
not; it’s a right!" you say. Well, on
paper only, perhaps. One must
figure in the willingness of players
to talk and their emotional states.

Football is a highly emotional
game that reaches feverish
pitches. Football players are
sometimes highly emotional
people. They have every right to
tell you to go to hell if they don’t
want to talk to you in the locker
room. Sure, they're professionals,
but their right is to speak only if
they want to.

By Paul Tatkovski
Staff Writer

After a convincing loss you
iwould expect most teams to be a
little down. Not the women’s
tennis team. Clarion University
stepped onto the courts of the
Cost Center yesterday and played
some impressive tennis to capture
a 7-2 victory over the Lady
Panthers.

The atmosphere after the match
was filled with laughter and
relaxation. The loss, Pitt’s fifth in
nine outings, showed virtually
no effect on the team’s
enthusiasm.

Pitt’s team serves as a second
family for many of the players.
No. 1 player Julie LoPrinzi said,
“The most important part [of
playing for Pitt] is team unity; we
love each other. We're a family.”

LoPrinzi seems to serve as one
of the leaders of the team both
on and off the court. Kathryn
Bratton, Pitt’s No. 2 player, said
that LoPrinzi “makes me relax so
I can concentrate more on my
tennis. We play well together.”

The bright spot for Pitt was the

with team travel plans, get home
to their families, etc. So they
should indeed be free to do their
business while talking to the
media instead of waiting to get
undressed or granting every
interview they are asked.

Now, if you have a designated
post-game interview area, the
coach and certain players are
available.

So, you ask, “But what if the
guy you want to talk to isn’t one
of the players in the room?”

Well, at Pitt reporters are free
to request whatever player they
want to members of the sports-
information department. Usually,
people get what they need. But if
they don’t, tough bananas. Part
of the art of sportswriting is to
make do with what you have.
And with a coach and several
players, a reporter should have
enough.

And let’s face it, usually the S

players you want to talk to are
those who performed

that’s usually who they" will bring

play of Julie LoPrinzi. She is
touting an 8-1 singles and a 5-3
doubles record this year. Her
performances amounted to Pitt’s
only results in the win column.
But it didn’t come easy for the
sophomore from Mercerville, N.
J.
In singles she took three sets to
dispose of No. 1 Tammy Myers,
6-1, 4-6, 6-0.

In doubles action LoPrinzi
teamed with Bratton en route to
a nail-biting, three—set win over
Myers and No. 5 Shara Walkomir,
7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (86).

With dramatic style LoPrinzi’s
game-winning shot hit the net
and dropped over to earn Pitt the
win. Myers had twice squared off
against LoPrinzi and tasted defeat.

Upon her exit Myers unleashed
a wicked forehand that probably
would have served her better in
her match against LoPrinzi. Only
this time her opponent was a
glass of water that gave the

hallway of the new Cost Center
an unwelcome baptism.

WALES CONFERENCE
Patrick Division

Literally anything can happen in this, arguably the
closest division in hockey. Not the best, just the closest.
Any of the six teams are possible playoff teams, which is
a good indication of the parity (or mediocrity) here.

First, there are the New York Rangers, with a bright
young goalie and expectations of a full-season
performance from Brian Leetch. It is a solid defensive
team with a decent power play, excepting last year’s

playoffs. If they can avoid injuries and play 800d defense.
their aging offense won’t matter much. Their talent,
however, does not resemble that of the New Je1‘SeY
Devils.

The Devils, who are loaded with a plethora of talented
players (Sean Burke, Patrik Sundstrom, Peter Stastny,
Viacheslav Fetisov, et al.), took most of last year just
getting used to each other and were still a good team.
They improved by 17 games last year, but to continue
improving, the power play has to get better. In a division
where the teams are so close, a better power play could
vault the Devils to the top. Burke’s play is also crucial to
this club. If he avoids the inconsistency that has plagued
him, the Devils can take the division.

The New York Islanders’ playoff appearance last

season most likely wasn’t a ﬂuke because they used tough
defense and the scoring ability of Pat LaFontaine to reach
the semiﬁnals before falling to the Rangers. But the Isles

rely far too much on the output of LaFontaine and captain

Brent Sutter.

What Coach Al Arbour needs is some other players to
step forward and relieve some of the scoring pressure that
LaFontaine carries. New York isn’t a particularly high-
scoring team, and the loss of Bryan Trottier will haunt it.
But the defense can and will carry this team.

Here in the Steel City, the Pittsburgh Penguins must
prove they can be more than barely average without
Mario.

acquired T rottier andjoey Mullen.
Both players will help, but the
biggest addition is the coach,
Bob Johnson. Johnson’s mere
presence on this team almost

But given the Pens’ past, playing
good defense consistently will
take time.

Their power play could be the
best in the league, but without
Mario, it will be an up-and-down

yean

The Philadelphia Flyers sure
know something about missing
games due to injuries, for they
lost a team—record 388 man-games
last season. T 0 you non-hockey
buffs, that means that any time a
man is injured and misses a game,
it counts as. a man lost and thus a
“man-game.” For you statistics
buffs, that means the Flyers
averaged nearly five injuries per
game (4.85, actually).

If everyone stays healthy,

however, this is still not a great
team. The combination of old
age and youthful inexperience
does not bode well for Coach
Paul Holrngren. The problem will
be finding the right mix and
getting a full season in goal from
Ron Hextall. A new generation of
players must replace the old one
in Philly. .

As for the Washington
Capitals, who pulled a
disappearing act after reaching
the semifinals a year ago, the

Willie Jett, a former graduate assistant at
Cornell University, has been named a graduate
assistant basketball coach at the University of
Pittsburgh, announced basketball coach Paul

Jett, who replaces Brian Regan, will assist the
coaching ' staff with film exchanges and
recruit mailings and on-court

In addition to his duties with the team, Jett will
also work , with the Little Panthers, coaches’
clinics and Pitt’s summer youth basketball camps.

A native of Minneapolis, Minn., Jett spent his
freshman year at the U.S. Naval Academy playing
for Evans. He transferred to the University of
Illinois at Chicago, where he earned a bachelor’s
degree in physical education in 1988.

“I have kept in Contact with Coach Evans over
the past four years and also followed Pitt
basketball,” said Jett. “I am familiar with Coach
Evans, his staff and his players. I have high
regard for the Big East Conference, and I love
the city of Pittsburgh.”

While at Pitt, Jett will continue to pursue his
master’s degree in educational counseling, which
he started at Cornell. A

absence of Scott Stevens will loom
large. When Stevens didn’t play
because of injury last year, the
Caps’ defense nearly resembled
Pittsburgh’s. The good news is
that this team is young and can
improve, has a great goalie in
Mike Liut and a rising star in
scoring whiz John Druce. But
playoff—bound they’re not. In this
division nearly anything could
happen, and injuries could play a
big role in determining playoff
teams. Most likely, the Caps won’t
be there, and the Flyers and Pens
are on the bubble, but many
questions abound. ’

Adams Division

In a tough division, perhaps
the strongest, last year the Boston
Bruins had the best regular-
season record and lost in the Cup
finals. A repeat season is not out
of the question if they stay healthy.

The goaltending duo of Andy
Moog and Reggie Lemelin is
among the best around, and the
Bruins are deep and defensive-
minded, two ingredients for a
championship team.

Norris Trophy winner Ray
Bourque and right winger Cam
Neely are the leaders, with young
Glen Wesley emerging as a star.
The offense isn’t great, but a tight,
aggressive defense will take you
far.

No matter how far the_ Bruins
went last year, the Buifalo Sabres
weren’t far behind. The Sabres

* made a big move, obtaining Dale

Hawerchuk to bolster the second
line. But the price was steep;
losing ‘Phil Housley will hurt.
Housley was the leader of the
top—ranked, penalty-killing club.
A new defensive leader must
emerge to take pressure off goalie
Darren Pupa. Pierre Turgeon and
Dave Andreychek have the
controls on offense, and the'Sabres
have the ability to knock off
Boston. The defense is the key.

Defense is important with the
Montrwl Canadiens, now that
Chris Chelios and Craig Ludwig
have departed. The Habs’ 22-
point‘ drop-off last year was the
league's largest. Patrick Roy
returns as the best goalie in the
NHL, but the rest of the defense
isn’t the same.

Offensively, the additions of
Denis Savard and Sylvain Turgeon
bolster a team which, though
deep, had trouble scoring late in
crucial games. If another
defensive leader (besides Roy)
emerges, the Habs ‘will be
competitive; if Roy is left alone, it
will be a long year in Montreal.

It was a long year in
Connecticut. The Hartford
Whalers, even though they
finished above .500, had a losing
home record. Too many “ifs”
surround this team; If the new
imports can improve the offense,
if the power play stabilizes, if
Hartford can improve while
holding on to Kevin Dineen and
Scott Young, etc.

The additions of Carey Wilson ~

and Czech sensation Bobby Holik
should improve an anemic
offense which finished 19th last
year. But the real need is for a
mobile defenseman to improve
the shaky power play. Chances
are it won’t happen this year for
the Whalers _,

It definitely won’t happen this
year in Quebec. The Quebec
Nordiques can only ‘wait for
their young, unproven talent to
develop. A new front-office team
should point this franchise in the
right direction, but it still has to
deal with this year.

Joe Sakic is the offensive star
and probably will be the only
offensive star. Rookie Owen
Nolan should help this team, but
without proven goaltending the
going will be very rough. Look
for Buffalo and Boston to battle it
out in another close battle.
