City’s

student  
leaders

talk votes  

John Manganaro ' T

Assistant News Editor

Last night’s Pittsburgh Student Gov-
ernment Council meeting quickly
took on a bit of an apocalyptic ﬂa-
vor when the conversationturned to

- student-voter turnout. A g
Shawn Carter, who serves as chief

of staff for ‘City Councilman Ricky
Burgess, spoke for about halfan hour
during the PSGC’s regular monthly
meeting, which brought together stu-
dent leaders from morethanlo local
colleges and universities. '
Carter stressed the importance of
student civic engagement, especially
at the ‘level of city and state govem—

ment, warning that if students don’t - 1’ 

start casting more votes,theywillnot
be able to impact lawmakers’ deci-
sions. ‘

“Gov. Tom Corbett won his ofﬁce I
by amarginthatwas about 100,000 V

votes less than the total number of
college students currently living in

Pennsylvania, then he went on to‘ cut
abillion dollars infundingfromthose

st11dents,”he said.“'I‘here’s something
not quite right about that picture.”

“Politicians only listen to voters,”
he said. “And students aren’t typically
voters.” .

Carter said that despite students’
potentially great impact on the Penn-
sylvania and Pittsburgh political pro—
cesses, their general disinterest on
Election Dayhas leftthemvulnerable
to ﬁmding cuts and other harmful
legislation.

Student painting stolen from Frick

john Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s Department of StudioArts andthe Pittpolice
are investigating the theft of a student’s painting
thatwastaken earlierthisweekfromthe basement
of the Frick Fine Arts Building.

The painting was stolen from a wall on the
bottom ﬂoor of the building on Monday between
4 and 5:30 p.m. The staff of the studio arts de-
partment have asked that if the painting is found,
it be returned to locker No. 29 in the building’s
basement.

No questions will be asked if the painting is
returned anonymously, said Karoline Swiontek,
an administrative assistant in the Department

 

of Studio Arts. _

‘Allwewantisforthe paintingto be returned,”
she said. . '

To that end, the department has printed. and
distributedﬂiers around campus featuringa copy
of the painting. The stolen image depicts awoman’s
shroudedfaceonagreyﬁeld andwas composedfor
an introduction to painting course as an exercise
on developing “convincing ﬂesh tones.”

Department administrators are hopeful that
the piece of art will be returned, though they do
not have a time frame for their effort to recover
the painting. ’

The painting’s artist declined to comment on
the apparent theft, and asked that her name not
be included inthis story, as she did notknowwho

Pitt’s Student Government Board President

Carter’s assessment is an accurate one. Stu-

hiding tattoos during job interviews whenever

“While some employers may be more lenient,
others may not, and you typicallywon’t have away

“I doworry about [mytattoo] intheﬁ.tturewhen

Ivory tower not
just for jobs

any don’t consider
universities centers
of higher education,

but rather enablers of higher in-
come. '

More than ever before, col-
lege is viewed as a means to an
end. According to an Associated
Press‘-Viacom poll conducted in
partnership with Stanford Uni-
versity, most students at four-year
institutions decide what major to
choose and what school to attend
based on one concern: monetary
payoff. A I
Correspondingly, 55 percent of
those surveyed said they valued
an education that emphasized
“success in the working world”
over one that emphasized “gen-
eral knowledge and critical think-
ing.” Implicit in this statement,
of course, is a prioritization of
“practical” majors — business,
engineering, nursing — over
those in the humanities.

In some ways, this makes
sense. Even a few distinguished
professors in the latter ﬁeld doubt
the practical applications of their
teachings. Stanley Fish, for in-

stance, a professor of humanities ‘

and law at Florida International
University, acknowledged in a
New York Times column that “You
can’t argue — well you can, but it
won’t ﬂy —’ that a graduate who
is well-versed in the history of
Byzantine art will be attractive to
employers (unless the employer is
a museum).”

Education, however, has multi-
faced, often overlooked beneﬁts,
and prospective students must
ultimately choose which aspects
they value most.

Indeed, it would be a mistake
to dismiss the liberal arts as whol-
ly lacking in merit: A degree in
philosophy, for instance, might

— not bump your job application to

the top of the pile, but it will allow
you to reason in waysthat will
beneﬁt society.

In fact, a education in the hu-

manities is invaluable to becom— .

ing a more responsible, more

informed citizen. A thorough-

understanding of Plato’s “The Re-

public,” for instance, won’t land I

you a job, but it signiﬁcantly aids
in selecting political candidates,
who often consciously or uncon-
sciously echo its teachings.
Furthermore, although a ﬁnan-
cially minded college education is
important, universities should be
the be—all, end-all for those pursu-
ing lucrative job. Indeed, highly
specialized technical schools
can often be more conducive to
achieving one’s desired career

V than more generalized four-year

institutions. ,

One region that recognizes this
is Western Europe. In much of the
continent, vocational institutions
are much more highly valued, and
there is a wider variety of second-
ary education possibilities. Ac-
cordingly, as a February study out
of the Harvard Graduate School
of Education argues, there is a
much clearer correlation between

choice of school and career ob—.

jective.

A We’re not here to tell you that
the traditional college experience
isn’t valuable for career-minded
students —— merely that treating
it exclusively as a ﬁnancial com-
modity obscures its possibilities.
There are, in fact, innumerable
ways to achieve ﬁnancial success
and realize one’s dream job. It’s
true that juicing liberal arts edu-
cation for all its cerebral treasures
might seem like a distraction. But
at least for some people, “intellec-
tual hedonism,” as the late Honors
‘College Dean Alec Stewart termed
it, is a worthy risk to take.I '

afternoons ago, when Ke$ha belt-

ed out some fans’ favorite catchy '

tunes. Halfway through, her danc-
ers put on dinosaur heads and
played with walkers as they all
sang “D-I—N-0-S—A-U—R, you are
' a dinosaur/ O-L-D—M-A-N, you’re

them, I couldn’t help but think
about them later on and‘ howtrue
they actually are. l .

' As young women, my friend
and I have spent years dealing
with older men talking loudly
about our looks as we walk by —

worse when you start going to

Middle-aged men making

mind, a 10-year age difference ’

what belongs under the “right”
and “wrong” categories. This is
the age in which people are at the
turningpoint between being chil-
dren and having children. Some
have already made that step.
Would you want that to happen
to your kid? If you can’t picture it,
how about imagining older men
ogling your sister or mother when
she was that age. Gross, huh?

In 2008. alone, the U.S. Equal

Employment Opportunity Com-
mission‘ received almost 14,000
charges of sexual harassment.
Around 16 percent of the alleged
victims were men, which_proves
that this can happen to either
gender, though not as often. The
terrible thing is, these statistics
aren’t even very accurate, because
most people don’t report their
experiences — especially men.
Now, I know that people are

just joking, sometimes. My friends
have driven by while I was walking
a couple times, and whistled at
me to be funny. The point is ——

’ with rape and sexual abuse still

affecting our communities — we
should not become adults who
think hitting on teenagers and

V young people is OK.

We should make an effort to
promote respect and restraint
when it’s appropriate. And ——-D as

we get older,‘ graduate and maybe
have families of our own —— we
should knowlthe difference be-
tween a joke and a serious prob-
lem and_ should not be afraid to
actaccordingly. '

I’m not trying to be a lecturer
to you, my wonderful peers. But
although I talk about the good

. side of sex mosrof the time, it’s

equally important to keep in mind
what happens on the other end of

Campuses ought to promote respect, restraint

the spectrum.

Let’s keep our groping and cat-
calling in the bedroom and off the
streets, shall we?

' MOVIE COLUMN

Masterpieces should be critiqued

Andy Tybout
Assistant Aé-‘xE Editor

 

It’s common knowledge that many visionary
movies were initially_misunderstood'—— or‘
worse, ignored —— by critics and the public.

But even now, as we celebrate their achieve-

ments,~do we really appreciate them for what
they are? 4 -

The Guardian recently examined a few “dif-
ﬁcult” ﬁlms that were originally slandered but _
later .ordained, often by the same critics, as
masterpieces. “Metropolis,” “Apocalypse Now”

and, ﬁttingly enough, “Rashomon” are some '

of the movies mentioned in the article. Other
famous acquired tastes, I might add, include
“2o_o1: A Space Odyssey,” which engendered a

 Mdecidedlypolarized response — some found it
much too dull — and “Eraserhead,” whichVari—

ety deemed “asickening bad—taste exercise.”
Although it’s not entirely true that, in the
newspaper’s words, “A painﬁil demise at the
box ofﬁce is almost a prerequisite for great~
ness” — see “The Godfather” —— it’s undeniable
that many culturally enshrined movies "were
initially maligned or ignored by critics and,
consequently, audiences. » .
~ . Nevertheless the reassuring sentiment that

many articles, including The Guardian’s, es-_

pouse that we’re— now able to truly appreciate
these ﬁlms or that we’ve become, in a sense,
enlightened, seems misguided. Indeed, many
difﬁcult works of art including the movies

' mentioned above now seem to suffer a decid-
. edly different form of misrepresentaﬁon: blind

reverence.
More often than not, in fact, critical opinions
on diflicult works do not become “enlightened”;
rather, they swing to the opposite pole. Now
movies that were once prematurely bashed
are uncritically heralded as masterpieces,‘ as if
in reparation for our past myopia. Proclaiming
“20o1: A Space Odyssey” a “perfect” ﬁlm, for
instance, has become acommon refrain among
cinephiles, particularly on movie websites like
Mubi. Ultimately however, it’s no more intel-
ligent than complaining about its pace or lack
of dialogue. In otherwords, to say awork of art

is a masterpiece does not preclude the need for
nuanced analysis and an acknowledgement that
it bears imperfections. 4, ,

To illustrate this, I’ll defer to a case study in

A literature. Although initiallythe subject of mixed

reviews, a majority of literary critics now con-
sider David Foster Wallace’s 1996 novel “Inﬁnite
Jest” a postmodern masterpiece and an incisive
critique of America’s commercial malaise with a
brilliantly obsessive style to complement this.
On Yahoo Answers, a site that allows users_

to post any question they wish and receive re-
sponses from other users, aparticularly clever
reader uploaded a question under the title:
“First page of my book. What do you think?”
The accompanying text was, amusingly enough,
the first six paragraphs of “Inﬁnite Jest.” The
reaction was enough to devastate any aspiring

’ writer: The most popular response read, “You
if kndwyour story needs more work, so you don’t
need anyone to tell you what you already know.” .

Others complained about the passage’s exces-
sive “stiffness” and formality.

The Yahoo user’s intent for this exercise, of
course, was to underscore our abysmal ability
to detect value in art. Nevertheless, although
many of the criticisms were indeed idiotic, Iwas

i left wondering whether others weren’t wholly

invalid. For instance, one user mentioned that
Wallace’s use of the phrase “surrounded by
heads and bodies” felt imperfect — and in-
deed the expression seems more wordy than
evocative. For many people, however, even this
admonishment is taboo: Conventional wisdom
holds that the writer is, in the words ofThe New
York Times, “the best mind of his generation,”
and that any complaints about his style are un-
founded. “Inﬁnitejest,” like the aforementioned
ﬁlms, has become impervious to criticism.

This is not to s'ay we can’t champion our _

favorite movies or books —— merely that when
critiquing them, we can’t subscribe to the notion
that they’re sacred, unknowable objects. Ulti-
mately, in fact, this might boil down to a simple
truism: The fact thataﬁlmhas been proclaimed
an avant-garde masterpiece shouldn’t paralyze
our critical instinct. After all, the biggest travesty
that could befall a great ﬁlm isn’t lack of interest
— it’s lack of thorough understanding. _,

thick fabrics, like wool, but they’ll all dry out in

 plaguedboththe Pit: men and

women’s soccer team this spring sea-

son, but it gave bothteams the oppor-

« mnity to develop experience heading

into next  season.
The men’s team tested players in
different positions to see how they

‘ would play, while the women’s team

wasforced to ‘start all 11 of its ros-

‘ tered players. Both head coaches for

the teams said that while the 
were unfortunate, nowtheteams know
where they stand as they prepare for
next season.

The teams concluded spring play
last Saturday, as they ﬁnished an exhi-
bition schedule in their new stadium,
the Petersen Sports Complex.

While bothteams experienced inju-
ries, the women’steamseemed able to

A persevere past them more easily than

the men. , .

Althotigh it played the majority of F

the springwithjust11players——mean—
ing, ithad no substitutes — thewomen
had a dominate record, at 4-0-1.

3 “Youdlikethingsto go oneway, but.
 . you just got to do the best with what

you have, and I think we did that this
spring,” head coach SueMoy Chin said
in an interview Monday. “We would
have liked some different things. I

Men, women wrap up spring season

would have liked to see some combi-
nations — whether it’s at forward or
in the midﬁeld — but we didn’t have
the players to do that.”

Despite injuries, thewomen’steam
still took positives away from the situ-
ation. » A
“We got a couple of girls backfrom
injuryinthe lastgame —buttoplay
90 minutes with 11 girls, our ﬁtness
was really good,” Chin said. “We had
girls playing out of position in order
to play.” ' l

The lack of depth gave younger
players such as midﬁelder Danielle
Benner, forward Morgan Masci and

defenderAlyssaMeierachanceto gain '

valuable on-ﬁeld experience."

“It helps intheir developmentto get
that experience,” Chin said. “Itallows
them to show us what they can bring
to the program. The competition was
good. Itwasn’tBigEast opponents, but

it’s still important to get, that experi—_

ence.”

Perhaps the biggest change from
last fall to this spring and beyond is
in goal. Morie Kephart —,— the school’s
all-time wins and shutouts leader —

tinaRiouxplayedmostofthis month’s -

“She’s been trainingbehind Morie
forthe pastthree years, so itwas good

forhertogetsomeactioninthe netand _
some playingtime,” Chin said. “Ithelps

build her conﬁdence. It’s differentfrorn
just  to apply it to a game.”

The Panthers shut out four ‘of
their ﬁve opponents this spring. Only
Duquesne cracked their defense, but
Pitt still won 5-2.

“We deﬁnitely made some mis- _

takes, but I think we’re a little bit
more seasoned now,” Chin said. _“Our
understanding got a lot better in the

. attack with our possession, but our

decision-making needs to be better.
I think that’s youth — understanding
differentplayingsitnations and differ-
ent pressure.”

But while the women ﬁnished un-
defeated despite the injuries, t11emen’s
team had more trouble adjusting to
the change.

“We didn’t get donewhatwe hoped
in the spring mainly because of inju-
ries,” men’s head coachjoe Luxbacher
said. ' I

A Luxbacher used the spring to try ,

players atnewpositions. The Panthers
had to replace departing defenders

‘ Connor Malone and Andy Kalas, and

Luxbacherwas creative indoingso. He
shifted Robert Iledare — previously a
forward — to the back line.

“We wanted to get an idea going '

into the fall —- avery good idea — of

But the seven Pitt players
entering this month’s NFL draft

"might have an advantage over '

Drew Smith, who will rep-

“There are priority free

Smith said. “And I think a lot of

Men’s soccer co-captain Ryan Brode looks to kick the ball in a recent exhibition game
against Duquesne at the new Petersen Sports Complex.

in the back. He did a pretty solid job.”

Goalkeepers Keegan Gunderson and Matt _

Aberegg missed time with concussions, which
gave tryout player Mark Hast several starts. - ‘

Luxbacher also considered Mike Whitaker .

at center back, shifted defender Alex Harrison
up to midﬁeld and tried.Alex Fischetti at right
back. Fischetti split time between the back line

and midﬁeld last season before a concussion cut '

it short. . ~

‘°We’fe goingto play abit different system next
fall,” Luxbacher said. “We’re looking at that this
spring.”

That system—which theteamstarted to use
toward the end oflast year —-— is a4-3-3, inwhich
the Panthers will play three forwards instead of
two. With the change, the men’s team ﬁnished
springplay 2—2—2 and held the oppositionto three
goals in six games. -

Yet,likelastyear, the Pantherscreatedchances

l but struggled to ﬁnd the back of the net
“Weneedtoputtheballinthegoal,”midﬁelder '

Ryan Brode said in an interview Tuesday “We’ve
been pretty good defensively, but offensively, we

V really haven’t been able to ﬁnd our rhythm.”

Luxbacher was impressed with how the ad:
justments went even though it didn’t show on

the scoreboard. Pitt played the Pittsburgh River- '

 

hounds ~— a local professional team — to open
the exhibition season and matched them chanc“e~
for—chance until the Riverhounds scored a late
goal to win 1-0. .

“We played prettywell,” Luxbacher said. “We
had chances. They’re deﬁnitelyaBig East—caliber
outﬁt. They’re a professional‘ group.”

The_scores of the games mean little inthe long
run, as Pitt’s spring lineup won’t resemble the
ﬁnal fall team. The Panthers have eight recruits

' arrivingfor training camp in August.

The men’s and women’s teams have already
adjusted to the new synthetic turf at their new
stadium, which allows for crisper passesthanthe
grass at Founders Field.

“Ithinkit stood outtl1eﬁrstgame,” Chin said.
“We movedthe ball around reallywell. Ourposses—
sion was probably the best I’ve seen it in a game,
andlthinkthathas alotto do with the surface
we’re playing on.”

Both Chin and Luxbacher said thatthe move to
campus helps theminevery aspect ofthe program
—fromtrainingto recruitingto playing. ,

“Itallows youtoplaybetter soccer,” Luxbacher
said. “You can really use skill more. When you
play on aﬁeld like Founders, especially late inthe
season, it’s muddy and heavy. You can’t play the
same way you do when the surface is good.” ﬂ

Pitt players better prepared
for NFL than most      

Jovenitti 4 11

Luc Felakl Senior Staff Photographer

Former Pitt head football coach Dave Wannstedt addresses the media at August’steam
media day. With his ties to the NFL, Wannstedt has given his former players an advantage.

championship.

Smith, however, sees a tangible benefit
of sharing with the Steelers. it

“There’s almost a sense of professional-
ism — like they’re kind of there already,”
Smith said of Pitt’sgplayers. “That’s not
saying that they have an attitude or any-
thing like that, but they see how the Steel-

ers carry themselves, and they see how"

those players act, and they’re exposed to
it.” “So I think that they have a better feel
for what an NFL player is supposed to be
and the work and the dedication and the
attitude that’s supposed to go into it better
than some of the other teams that aren’t
exposed to it.”

So maybe it’s not so bad that the Steelers

 seem to steal Pitt’s thunder everyfall.

Also, remember Wannstedt, that guy
that fans were all so happy to see hit th_e
road in December after another mediocre
season?_

Well, he truly cares for these players
— anybody who saw his resignation press
conference knows that. Nearly the entire
team stood by his side as Wannstedt emo-
tional_ly said goodbye.

Wannstedt coached for the Dallas Cow-
boys, Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins
before coming to Pitt,‘ and he’s now the as-
sistant head coach for the Buffalo Bills.

“With coach Wannstedt being there, he
obviously had a pipeline to the NFL and
did an outstanding job of helping guys‘
maximize their potential and get to that
next step — into the NFL,” Smith said.

Oh, and the fact that Pitt played a pro-
style offense and defense probably won’t'

.hurt the players looking for a job in the

NFL.
So before we say good riddance to

gWanny, maybe we should take some time

to appreciate just how much he helped
these Pitt players. .
