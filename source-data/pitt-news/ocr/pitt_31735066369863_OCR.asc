Bouquet Townhouse
Feasibility Studied

By WES COTTER

The University of Pittsburgh is
currently reviewing a feasibility
study on the proposed building of 17
to 20 townhouse units on its vacant
Bouquet Street property.

If approved, thetownhouses will
be built by Ryan Homes, Inc. The
university is looking at different
packages in an attempt to decide
which is best suited to its needs.

Two- and three-bedroom units
are being proposed for the site
which, when completed, would be
sold, not rented.

John Vrana, assistant vice-
chancellor for business and finance,
said the university “is looking at dif-
ferent packages and fixed plans.”

He went on to say that no final
decision has been made, but that
Ryan Homes is preparing a detailed
study which the university will con-
sider in a few weeks.

Vrana said,“The study will be
evaluated [for] its financial feasibil-
ity.” He also said that the building’s
esthetic possibilities would also be
considered.

Vrana said financing, architectu-
ral appearance, size and adaptability
to the building site will be important
in considering the start of work on
the project.

University

Various faculty, staff and student
groups have been discussing the pos-
sible need for child care services at
Pitt for a number of years.

Two groups in particular, the Uni-
versity Affirmative Action Commit-
tee (UAAC) and the Staff Advisory
Council (SAC), decided to join for-
ces in the past vear and have asked
Chancellor Wesley Posvar for help.
UAAC and SAC decided that the
need for child care at the university
was unmet and started a series of
discussions with Posvar.

Last February, Posvar appointed
a committee entitled Working
Group on Child Care to review the
need for day-care services within the
university community.

If the group had discovered that a
need for child care did exist, it would
also have had the additional task of
developing possible options to
satisfy the university’s needs.

The group was chaired by Dr.
Maryann Bishop-Coffey, director of
the Office of Affirmative Action,
and co-chaired by Edgar Duncan,
associate dean of the Graduate
School of Public Health. Other fac-
tions of the university were also
represented.

According to Duncan, the group

Money is one of the main consid-
erations in the decision phase, and
Vrana said, “When you put some-
thing on a piece ofpaper you have to
decide if it's at a marketable price.”

The townhouses, if built by Ryan
Homes for Pitt, will be sold on a
priority basis to faculty and staff of
Pitt, according to Vrana.

Vrana hopes that if this plan is
approved, those people would take
advantage of the location and move
into the townhouses. If the staff is
not motivated to buy the town-
houses, they will be sold to the pub-
lic, according to Vrana .

The townhouses will be single-
family units in accordance with a
plan that was drawn up to help
decide the most effective place for
certain types of housing in the Oak-
land area, Vrana said.

Meetings were held in the Oak-
land community to hear from local
citizens so that the building would
be welcomed and supported by eve-
ryone involved.

The proposed townhouses will be
two- and three-bedroom units which
will include a kitchen, living and din-
ingroom area and a game room or
workshop area.

was asked to submit a report by July
31, 1983.

The report was submitted to the
Chancellor on Aug. l, i983, accord-
ing to Michael Bruner, Coffey’s
assistant.

Bruner said the group decided
that there was a need for child care
services within the university com-
munity and submitted a proposal
outlining possible options along
with the report.

The university should develop a
center for day care in addition to
those facilities already existing at the
Falk School, Bruner said. The pro-
posal suggested a program for
infants and pre-schoolers, possible
five days a week and four nights,
Bruner said.

“The proposal was to make this as
cost efficient an operation as possi-
ble,” Bruner said.

Taking into consideration the
limited space within the university
itself, the group also explored
churches and other vacant space in
the Oakland area as possible loca-
tions for the center, Bruner said.

Duncan said that by the time the
issue is acted upon, there may be
vacant space within the university,
considering the opening of the new

Forbes Avenue between Meyran
Avenue and McKee Place.

University Computers is a
privately-owned retailer that,
although not formally related to
the university, is “definitely dedi-
cated to serving its users,”
according to co-owner John
Petrush.

“We are here to serve all edu-

the only Pitt faculty member
directly involved with the store,
“and we will be ready to order
anything not in the store.”

Collegiate Corner

COLUMBIA, Mo. - According to a study conducted by Dr. Javad
Kashani at the University of Missouri at Columbia, as many as one-fourth of
this year’s freshman class will consider committing suicide before their first
year of college is done.

The problem may be responsible for the fact that only 40 percent of this
year’s freshman class will graduate in I987.

In the study, freshman and seniors alike were studied, and 27 percent of
the freshman said they had considered suicide, and none ofthe seniors said
they did.

Kashani attributes these alarming figures to freshman having to make a
rapid role change from childhood to young adulthood. He said the freshmen
are away from their family and friends for the first time and are under great
pressure to do well academically since their parents are paying for their
studies for the first time.

NEW YORK, N.Y. ~ A sequel to the controversial “The New York Times
Selective Guide to Colleges" is scheduled for publication this month, accord-
ing to The Chronicle of Higher Education.

In the first book, Pitt had an average rating. _

The book, entitled the “Selective Guide to Colleges” by Edward Fiske,
education editor for the Times, will not carry the newspaper’s name because
the publisher feels that the opinions are those of Fiske alone and not the
pa er’s. _ _

Eiske and the paper received a great deal of criticism from many universi-
ties’ administrations because of what was termed as “subjective” means of
gathering and presenting information, the Chronicle said.

Civil Rightsﬁemais An Issue At Pitt

By DOLORES RICE

Although most students may not
think so, the civil rights issue is an
ongoing controversy on American
college campuses, and Pitt is no
The Black Action
Society (BAS) was formed to help
alleviate problems faced by the
black students and to keep a watch-
ful eye on the university’s treatment
of such problems, according to BAS
Chairman Daryl Davis.

The year 1968 was a turning point
for black students at Pitt, Davis said.
After years of being practically
ignored by the university, a large
group of black students staged a
protest against Pitt’s administration
with a list of demands.

They placed before the adminis-
tration the following list of demands:
more programs oriented toward
black studies; an active recruitment
committee; and vehicles for black
students to express themselves
both educationally and socially.

Davis said the protesting group
founded the BAS and came to be
known as the “voice of the black
community.” The university agreed
to the demands, and the BAS
worked together with black faculty
and administrators to ensure that
these demands continued to be met
throughout the years.

The BAS’s efforts toward provid-
ing equality between black and
white students has progressed since
1968, but there is still a long way to
go, according to Davis.

“I don’t believe blacks in general
will ever attain the same type of life
the whites are entitled to,” he said.

One of the main reasons for this
inequality is the inescapable herit-
age of black Americans, he said. It is
almost impossible to forget the deg-
radation placed on the blacks in the
past, and it is difficult to make repa-
ration now when the misconcep-
tions have been ingrained into the
general public’s minds through not
only history books, Davis said, but
through continued media biases.

The BAS tries to offset these
injustices which, Davis said, still
feed on the public mind. The BAS is
a body in the university which deals
with the SGB and RSA when racial
conﬂicts arise.

Over the past 15 years, the BAS
and Pitt’s administration have deve-
loped a mutual respect for each
other, according to Davis. The BAS
works in conjunction with the Uni-
versity Community Educational
Program (UCEP) and Affirmative
Action programs to recruit both
financially and educationally disad-
vantaged blacks.

Efforts by the federal government
through its Office of Civil Rights to
desegregate Pennsylavia schools
have made the semi-dorrriant issue
of civil rights a major one at Pitt.

Under the plan, according to
Pitt’s Affirmative Action director
Mary Bishop—Coffey, Pitt hopes to
attract each year a total of 15 stu-
dents from Lincoln and Cheyney
State Universities, both predomi-
nantly black schools, for its law,
medicine and dentistry programs.

In addition, Pitt, Penn State and
Temple are to establish liaisons with
Lincoln and Cheyney, and Pitt plans
to establish a special undergraduate
program with Lincoln.

“To recruit is not enough,” Davis
said. “We must recognize and care
whether they graduate.”

Davis also hopes to increase the
present 10 percent minority rate to
the desired 20 percent.

A committee within the BAS
entitled Black Active Student Inter-
Collegiate Struggle (BASICS) ena-
bles Pitt to share strategies to solve
civil rights conﬂicts with other Pen-
nsylvania colleges. The BASICS
committee creates a link between all

The BAS is also affiliated with the
Black Student Coalition (BSC),
black sudent unions in Pennsyl-
vania.

which serves as a network between

These combined groups help unify
the black student population at Pitt
by listening to other colleges’ prob-
lems with equality and civil rights
violations. according to Davis.

The BAS continues to try to
reach out and learn from other uni-
versities, Davis said, but also
reaches out to the individual stu-
dents at -Pitt.

“[Previously] I didn’t think the
BAS was involved as much as they
should have been,” he said, “but
after visiting the office just once, I
realized how effective they can be.”

With the implementation of the
new affirmative action plan, talk
about the distribution of blacks on
the state’s campuses and the
renewed interest in whether col-
leges are being fair in their recruit-
ment of blacks, the BAS may find its
role on campus changing.

Opinion

Change Tactics 1

Americans love to join organizations that have
causes attached to them. Whether anti-nuclear groups,
pro-choice and pro-life groups, or Save the Whales
groups, Americans love to get involved and try to
change the course of the nation and the world.

This attitude is to be commended. We live in a
democratic society and should be allowed to try to
change a policy if we don’t like it.

There is a problem with some organizations, how-
ever, and their ineffectiveness. One of these is the
anti-nuclear movement and the radicalism of some of
its members.

Dr. Liane Norman, a Pitt English professor, and
Molly Rush, director of the Thomas Merton Center,
were jailed on Saturday after refusing to pay a $75 fine.
Both Norman and Rush had been arrested on Sept. 9
for defiant trespass and obstructing traffic during
demonstrations at the Federal, Westinghouse and
U.S. Steel Buildings.

They had until Friday to pay the fine, but refused
and were jailed instead. They are scheduled to be
released on Thursday. The other 16 activists involved
in the demonstrations are out of jail. Five paid the fine,
and 11 were released after spending the night in jail.

These protesters have a right to demonstrate and
express their opinion about the nuclear arms race —
one of the biggest causes to hit the nation since
Vietnam. ,1

Unfortunately, aside from their families and friends,
nobody really cares about the jailing of these protes-
tors. The corporations who manufacture nuclear arms
and the government of the country probably don’t
think twice about them. If fact, they are probably
viewed as little pests and are not taken seriously.

It is the same with the hunger strikers who are
refusing to eat as a show of protest against the nuclear
arms race. They are hurting nobody except themselves
and their families. Their dedication to their cause is
admirable, but they are‘ taking it a little too far.

Although these protestors probably don’t have the
attention of corporations and government officials,
they do have the attention of the media. That is the key
to the hunger strikes, the demonstrations and thejail-
ings. They are out for media coverage and will stop at
no lengths to get it.

Since they have been splashed across the front pages
of newspapers and covered extensively by television,
many people in this country are beginning to get sick

of them and their causes. People have come to expect .

the jailings and the fines and aren’t surprised when
someone such as Molly Rush gets arrested.

The anti-nuclear arms groups are quickly losing the
respect of many people. They need to change their
tactics in order to gain support for their cause. The
government and the corporations are not listening to
them and regular citizens are beginning to turn their
backs also.

The anti-nuclear arms groups have a pertinent and
important cause, but they need to reflect on their
activism and radicalism. They need to gain support in
a more subtle way and sway the country over to their
side. Perhaps then the Rockwells, the Westinghouses
and the Reagans of the country will take them
seriously.

Tribute To The Student Union

By WESLEY C. COTTER

The Pitt student body, myself
included, seems to spend a good deal
of time complaining about the uni-
versity administration and every-
thing it does wrong.

The rap that university officials
take is largely due to the attitude of
the student, but in many cases, peo-
ple have a right to complain. Higher
tuition and shrinking services pro-
duce a great deal of frustration and
bring the attitude that money is the
only thing the university cares
about.

Complaints range from the long
lines at the registrar’s office to slow
elevators and lousy food in the
cafeteria that costs over $3 a meal.
But now I'd like to give the univer-
sity credit where credit is due.

The renovation of the student
union is theimost carefully planned
project the administration has given
Pitt students recently. The transfor-
mation of an old beat-up hotel into
the clean, colorful William Pitt

’Union is truly incredible.

The best part of the work, in my
opinion, is the landscaping that sur-
rounds the building. The trees, grass
and sidewalks around the union
make the city disappear for one
block, and in the words of another
student I spoke with recently, “It
makes it seem like a real school.”

The $14 million that was spent
was put to good use. I for one am not
disappointed in having to help pay
for such a nice job, and I think the
improvements will make things a lot
nicer for us as students.

Pool rooms and an arcade are nice
touches that give students, especially
commuters, a place to go that isn’t
like any of the other facilities on
campus.

The opportunities that the remo-
delling has given to organizations
based in the union is also worth
praising. The new ticket office is a
definite improvement in the system,
if only for reasons of access. The
Student Government Board, The
Pitt News and the Commuter Asso-
ciation are just a few examples of the

many organizations now in their
newly equipped offices, instead of
barely passable ones. As a member
of The Pitt News, I would like to step
forward and say the new office and
the equipment are great.

It seems that someone had us in
mind when they built the new union
and planned for the student.
Whoever that may be, thank you.

The union is in some ways the
center of the campus and the way the
new facelift has improved the looks
of the Schenley Hall, the new Pitt
Union will stand out as one of the
best looking buildings on campus.
In dirty, rundown Oakland, Pitt can
use all of the good looking buildings
it can get.

If anyone hasn’t had the chance to
just look around and see what’s new
in the old Schenley Hotel, I suggest
you do; it’s well worth the time.

And chances are good that as you
walk under the tall trees and have
green grass all around, you'll hear
someone say, “This is really nice;
they did a good job.”

On The Outside Looking In

By TODD ERKEL

It’s that time of the year again
when the sororities of Amos Hall
hang their rush laundry out for ever-
yone to read. Those sprightly
painted sheets welcoming all who
seek social deliverance may hang
like beacons for some, but I simply
do not understand the process.

_As it has been explained to me,
girls from all over these parts go
“rushing” to sororities where the
already-delivered welcome them
with big hug and kissy “hellos” and
“where you froms?" and “what’s ya
majors?” and subtly inquire as to the
expanse of daddy’s checkbook and
whether dating falls slightly above
breathing on one’s list of priorities.

The process gets down to business
during the following week when
things called “cut sessions” weed out
the not so “sorority oriented" —— in
other words, those whose parents
still bowl on weekends or whose
brothers chisel license plates for a
living. While the rules of the game
prohibit such skulduggery, I have
heard that some will go so far as to
take hip and bust measurements
(How? Do they put dusting powder
on the toilet seat? Do they mark off
their arms and then hug everyone”
who comes in?) to insure the sorori-

ty’s streamlined image. I have also
heard through the Sour-grapevine
that the _more_ethnically-based sor-
orities will quiz a pledge’s heritage
by offering her obscure, native foods
which she must suavely accept and
nibble without the slightest hint of
disgust.

The cuts ultimately leave a pros-
peer with _ two “final parties" to
attend, formal affairs where she will
get showered with gifts -— lime
ihmgss mugs, etc. —— which will

have an organization to voice
their concerns,” Mary Paradise,
president of the Pittsburgh Peace
Links chapter, said. “We do not
want to tell them what to say or
how to say it, wejust want to get
them involved in the issues.”

Women in the past often felt
detached from an issue such as
national security or else saw it as
too radical to become involved,
Conaway said. She hopes that
organizations like Peace Links
can erase those perceptions.

Over 50 women have regis-
tered for the workshop, includ-
ing groups from Mercer and
Washington counties, and Cona-
way thinks between 80 and 100
women will attend today.

Conaway sees Peace Links’
mission as two-fold: to keep
women informed of the various
studies and discussions being
conducted on the issue of
national security and the nuclear
arms race and to conduct similar
studies and panels of their own.

Both Conaway and Paradise
emphasized the need for student
involvement and encouraged
young people of all ages to
become more aware ofthe issues
before them.

“I think young people some-
times feel immobilized by the
idea of nuclear war,” Paradise
said. “We would like to get them
more involved.”

Both the workshop and the
organization have received
assistance from Pitt groups. The
Pitt Informal Program listed the
workshop in its fall schedule of
offerings and also provided
Peace Links with facilities in
Forbes Quadrangle. Pitt’s urban
and community services depart-
ment assisted Peace Links in the
writing of its state charter
application.

PPC Starts Leisure
Learning Classes

By KIMBERLY KALP

The Leisure Learning Pro-
gram, a collection of non-credit
courses, is being sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council this
fall. Courses are offered in the
areas of health and fitness, com-
munications, music, arts, self-
improvement skills and other
topics of interest.

Gina Miller, assistant director
of student activities and PPC
adviser, thought of the idea last
March, and a new committee
was appointed to organize the
program.

According to Judy Kenosky,
committee chairman, prepara-
tion began with an instructor
recruitment last spring.

“Flyers were distributed to
each member of Pitt’s staff, ask-
ing them to consider instructing

a class of their own topic, struc-

ture and time convenience,” she
said. The instructors will be
salaried.

“We tried to get topics geared
toward undergraduate inter-
ests,” Kenosky said. “However,
the program is open to the gen-

eral public.” She also made it
clear that the Leisure Learning
Program is not affiliated with the
Pitt Informal Program, which
offers similar courses.

So far, registration shows that
the most popular of the 26
courses are aerobic dance, fit-
ness, massage and witchcraft.

Although the committee
hoped registration would go
well, Kenosky said that enroll-
ment thus far has been only fair.
The majority of participants
enrolled are students.

The» Leisure Learning Com-
mittee believes the classes are
worth students‘ time and money.
The cost for students is generally
between $10 and $15. Non-
student costs are slightly higher.

“The Leisure Learning Pro-
gram will be offered again next
term,” Kenosky said. “We will be
looking for new instructors, and
we hope for increased
enrollment.“

Registration for the program
will close as of Friday, Sept. 23.
The seven-week courses run
from Oct. 1 to Nov. 18.

Penn State.

Anytime, anywhere, in any capac-
ity, the mere mention of Pitt’s cross-
state rival triggers insane reactions
in an otherwise sane student body.
When Pitt loses to Penn State as the
Lady Panthers volleyball team did
Saturday night at the field house for
three straight games, revenge, fast
and deadly, is the only remedy.

Now, however, is the time to
examine why the team, a veritable

Pitt women’s volleyball coach
Shelton Collier hosted the season's
first big tournament at the Field
House over the weekend. It was time
to find out exactly what the Lady

. Panthers had in them in the face of
superiority —— the face of Top 20
composure.

In the end, Collier and the Lady
Panthers probably found out
enough about poise and equanimity

to endure an entire collegiate career.
The composure was there to pull out
victory in the Pitt Classic, attended
also by Penn State, Louisville and
Florida State.

That, however, is pinpointedly

where the rapture ends and adversity
bears its intruding force. Pitt lost a
match to Penn State Saturday eve-
ning, but moreover was swept clean
of any setting capabilities.

The annual home scrimmage
against the Lady Lions undoubtedly
brings out the best in any Collier
roster. I983 started swaying in no
different a direction. Until, that is,
the awakening hours of Saturday.

Already, Pitt had come off an
impressive win over Florida State,
Friday night. An improvised 5-I
offense behind junior setter Cathy
Rupp revealed no exceptional ﬂaws.
Both the offense and the setter were
getting their first official tests since
captain Judy Young, another setter,
went down with an ankle sprain one
week ago.

With it went a hierarchically-
molded 6-2 offense.

But after success against FSU the
evening before, Collier readied his
squad for another breeding opera-
tion Saturday morning, Louisville
the opponent.

In this instance, though, adversity
bred adversity as Rupp was befallen
with a severe ankle sprain one min-
ute before match time —— one
crummy minute.

“One minute before the game,
Cathy went down before the match
for no apparent reason," Collier
recounted. “She was going through
a warmup routine.“

By now, Collier was ready to
panic. The man had no setter — no
injury-free one, anyway.

. Wasting no time, Collier mo-
tioned for Young who entered the
match with whatever energy some-

_ With the recent Penn State deci-
sion to use the I983 football season
to discover what it takes to become a
major college palsy. the race for the
Lambert Trophy, awarded to the
top college football team in the
Northeast. has taken a big turn.

It seems that prior to the start of
the season the Nittany Lions were a
consensus choice to repeat for a
third consecutive time as the recip-
ients. But there are few who will
acknowledge them as contenders
today.

Senior midfielder Nick Wilson
scored his second goal of the
game in the overtime period to
lead the Pitt soccer team to a 2-I
victory over Slippery Rock, Fri-
day night at Pitt Stadium.

Wilson, also scored l:l7 into
the first half, chipped the ball
over the Rock's goalkeeper to ice
the win in Pitt's longest game this
season. The win extended Pitt's
streak to four games, all against
West Penn Conference foes.

The lone Slippery Rock goal
was scored by Bill Stevens 28: I5
into the second half.

Pitt goalkeeper Dave Tor-

Booters Get A Piece Of The Rock

rence has now allowed only two
goals during the team's current
hot streak.

Overall, the defense played
another stellar game.

And, accoruing to Bemis, the
match could have been settled
before going into overtime.

“We had few missed oppor-
tunities," Bemis said. “With a lit-
tle more care, we could have had
a few more goals.“

“We had one shot at the cross-
bar, on hit the post and another
open net. So we had plenty of
opportunities." added defender
Brian Casey. “It shouldn't have
gone to overtime; the score

should have been 3-! or 3-0."

And while the team has had its
share of close chances this sea-
son, there is no reason to get
nervous.

“We're doing better than last
year,” said Casey, a sophomore.
“We're just having some prob-
lems ﬁnishing.”

Now, with a four-game win-
ning streak, the Panthers are
gaining confidence with each
game.

“We're taking it one game at a
time," Casey said. “Right now
our morale is very high and we
have the gut of our schedule

coming up in the next week."

Having taken a third straight
thrashing Saturday at the hands of
the high-powered Iowa Hawkeyes.
the Penn State defense —— or lack
thereof -~— has now yielded a grand
total of_ I00 points.

Though their offense showed
signs of life. posting 34 points
behind the arm of Doug Strang, who
had three touchdown tosses in addi-
tion to running one in himself, the
Lions turned the ball over four
times. three of them leading to cru-
cial second-half touchdowns.

Enough of the Lions; back to the

_ Lambert Race

Penn State R. I. P.; Pitt, BC, WVU Still Far

race. It is now upto Pitt, West Virgi-
nia and Boston College to step for-
ward. Each has established itself to
some degree.

Boston College (2-0). in their
opener with Clemson, fought
through first-half difficulties. which
found them trailing I3-3, to paste
the Tigers in the second half 3l-lb.

Despite losing the services of star
quarterback Doug Flutie to a first-
half concussion, the Eagles, who are
ranked 20th on the latest UPI poll.
had little trouble with Rutgers. He
was replaced by sophomore Shawn

Halloran, who was eight for I6 for
98 yards in the 42-22 victory.

This week the Eagles are prepar-
ing for a big Eastern showdown with
WVU (3-0), which is as legitimate a

contender as any for Eastern
supremacy.
The Mountaineers have been

quite impressive in posting the three

win column tallies. On Saturday

they took a big step toward national
acclaim as they handed l7th-ranked
(AP) Maryland its first defeat ofthe
season. 3|-2|.

Senior quarterback Jeff Hostetler

assembly-line machine, was diverted
from its undefeated course by the
Lady Lions, a strong team but one
that Pitt head coach Shelton Collier
believes his team will defeat when
next they meet.

“We'll be very prepared and have
ample motivation," says Collier.
“We feel we're better —— with all our
players, we're certainly a better
team.“

He was referring to the loss of
both of his setters, captain Judy
Young, who has been nursing a
sprained ankle, and junior Cathy
Rupp, who will be out 4-5 weeks due
to an ankle injury suffered in a
warm-up drill before the team's
match wi'h Louisville earlier
Saturday.

“Penn State's players are not only
excellent setters and very powerful
net players," said, Collier. “They are
strong setters, spikers and leaders."

The Nittany Lions were playing
without highly-touted spiker Patty
Skadeland, but Collier maintains
that it was not a comparable loss.

“Losing a spiker is analogous to
losing, say, a split-end in football,"
the Lady Panther coach stated. “But
losing your setter is like losing the
quarterback — and we lost both of
ours."

Collier was forced to replace his
veteran setters with sophomore
Sally Gillespie, the team's “defensive
sparkplug" but not a strong net
player.

“We tried to be cohesive with the
new system, making it up as we
went, but the team is young — no
seniors — and we found it hard to
adjust. We lacked firepower and
confidence."

Pitt's serving was not quite up to
par.

“We also tried to compensate for
the loss of our experienced setters
with tough serves. and when you're
trying to ace the serves to make

In their two initial games, the
Mountaineers walloped Ohio 55-3
and Pacific 44-7. Hostetler played
only the first half of each game but
still has over 400 passing yards in

Saturday's confrontation in Bean-
town will offer a good indication as
to who will capture the coveted

If West Virginia is able to come
out on top Saturday, then they
would be in a position to put a lock
on the award with a home victory
over Pitt on Oct. 1 and an assured
victory in Happy Valley on October
22. This is some task for West Virgi-
nia head coach Don Nehlen and his
troops, but they could very well
prove to be up to the challenge.

On the other hand, if the Eagles
reign supreme in the WVU contest,
then they would most likely only

when Pitt and West Virginia line up on Oct. 1, the Lambert

become willing. BC does not have
Pitt on their 1983 slate.

And then there are the Panthers.
What a surprise, having been tagged
by the world-famous football
monthly, Playboy magazine, to be
the victims of a 4-7 record at the

completion of the ’83 campaign.

Tennessee was supposed to have
the best of the inexperienced Pan-
thers, but it was a big-play Pitt
defense and a one-strike offense that
finished the Volunteers in the 13-3
upset.

Next came Temple. Some folks
actually spoke of Temple as having a
chance; they said Tim Riordan
could provide the Owls with potent
passing to overcome the Pitt

defense stifled Temple and the John

Congemi offense had a field day,
running for 283 yards and passing
for l77 during the 35-0 disposal.

Pitt is now well rested after having ‘

a weekend off. More importantly, it
had an opportunity to see its next
two opponents in action.

The Panthers will play the Terps
at Byrd Stadium in College Park on
Saturday with some good ideas on
how to solvethe “wide-tackle six”
defense that Maryland employs,
having witnessed West Virginia’s
ability to do so quite frequently
throughout Saturday night’s game.

After Maryland it will be time for
the Backyard Brawl with the Moun-
ties. Every available ticket has been
sold, including standing room, and
the fact that the Panthers have dom-
inated the series over the past ten
years is all the more reason for the
West Virginia fans to try and
become a part of the game.

It will be a tough game matching
two balanced teams, but this coming
weekend’s results will add fuel to the
fire, especially if both teams win.

Following the WVU game, the
Panthers play Florida State, Notre
Dame and, if they haven’t dropped
their program by then, Penn State.

The season for the three Eastern
powers, Boston College, West Virgi-
nia and Pitt, can be decided in the
next two weeks.

It sure is strange not mentioning
hapless Penn State.

FOOTBALL TRIV-BIT: The
blessed Joseph Paterno has done the
impossible. In losing their third
straight, the Lions broke the old
Paterno-coached teams’ streak of
two. They will be out to reset that
record this week as they visit Phila-
delphia to play Temple.

one with a sprained right ankle can

“Judy limped on after stretching
and played a great match, I guess,
for a miracle win," Collier said. “She
didn’t have another game in her. If
we would have had to play another
game, we would’ve been in big
trouble."

Louisville, coming off a loss
against Arizona State (ranked
eighth, NCAA) Thursday night,
found some trouble of its own and
never formulated a winning pattern.
The Lady Cardinals fell in four
gamesl5-12,15-18,12-15, 15-13.

The match signified a direct turn-
around from the night before. De-
spite an early deficit, the Lady
Panthers thoroughly outlasted
FSU’s Lady Seminoles 15-13, 15-5,
1 1-15, 15-9. That first game win des-
pite an early 8-1 deficit.

“We had a great deal ofapprehen-

" sion of what was to happen,”Collier

said ofthe tournament’s first match.
“Florida State came ready to play.
We were wondering if we were able
to play at that level because I didn't
think any of us really knew."

With the seven-point edge FSU
held, Collier consumed his first
timeout and convened the squad
into a pow-wow. A scalping was all
that was left to be accomplished.

“I put Sue Hoover in at left-side

hitting and moved Ulana back to
where she’s more comfortable —
middle hitting,” Collier disclosed of
the strategy only complemented by
increased aggressiveness. Kohutiak
originally started at the left side.
Heads started to roll.

“Sue never played there [outside
hitting] in her life," Collier said.
“She just started getting comfort-
able there. She then started ham-
mering put-away shots and Pat
Belcher [opposite outside hitter]
played one of her finest matches in
her life.

“Anytime you beat a program
from the South, it’s a great lift for a
team from the East.“

That lift all too rapidly deflated
Saturday evening~the Lady Pan-
thers preparing for intrastate war
with Penn State. Pitt showed up
with insufficient bullets and inade-
quate gas in the tanks. Penn State
prevailed in sweeping fashion, 15-
10.15-12, 15-10.

“We were really hurting but were
confident because we won last year's
Classic with Ulana out [with torn
ligaments],” Collier said. “But with
Cathy and Judy, that was just too
much. There just wasn’t enough
firepower.”

“We were so conscious of taking
the pressure off Judy,” Collier said,
“that we tried to compensate with
perfect serving. As a result, we

Page 1 l---

missed more than we normally miss.
That’s because we were nervous and
in a new system.

“Also, if Penn State returned the
ball we wouldn‘t be able to do much
because Judy couldn’t move around
very well."

Young only played two games in
the Penn State match. The third was
started with sophomore Sally Gilles-
pie at setter. With Young out for at
least three more weeks and Rupp,
nursing a more severe sprain, on the
sidelines for an expected four I0 five
weeks, Collier will now revert to Gil-
lespie to set a 5-1.

“She’s not anywhere near the set-
ter Cathy and Judy are,” Collier
said, “but she’s a good team leader."

“We had literally no offense at all
with Judy. Unless the ball was
passed perfectly [to her], she just
couldn’t get to it because of her
ankle. We just couldn‘t play an
intense and aggressive style,” said
Collier, “because we had no reason
for confidence.

“We could never really get going.”

GAME SERVES: With the tour-
nament victory came several other
accolades for the Lady Panthers
....Carmen Tapia, a 5-1 1 sophomore
at middle blocking, was tagged the
tournament MVP....Outside hitters
Pat Belcher and Ulana Kohutiak
picked up slots on the all-tounament
team selections....

things a little easier on your setter,

some will go into the net. The pres-
sure builds, and consequently, we
missed serves," Collier added.

Young agreed that the serves were
not that good, citing the position
players were given — Collier's “new
system" — that of having to play
with a line-up not yet welded
together with experience.

“We’ve been playing together a
certain way, and injuries suddenly
put inexperienced players into new
positions. They were worried about
it. “Whoever plays better wins, and
(Penn State) definitely played
better.”

Collier said that the weekend,
having defeated Florida State and

 

-‘g 

Louisville and won the tournament,
was success, but his team had its
“back to the wall."

The game with Penn State did
have its benefits.

“I would have preferred that we
had each just lost one player."

“As it was, however, the injuries
forced the other players to compen-
sate, which they did very well under
the circumstances. Inexperienced
players gained valuable experience
— a pressure situation of playing a
top team, along with keeping a win-
ning streak going."

Despite losing to the Lady Lions,
Pitt still came out on top of the clas-
sic by virtue ofdefeating Florida and
Louisville.

“We weren’t expected to beat
Louisville and Florida,” Collier
said. “In fact, the Louisville game
was just a miracle, and the FSU
game was also fantastic, a great
game."

Collier recalled last year’s match,
which his team also won; the team
jumped to No. 17 (NCAA) after
defeating several top-ranked teams,
including Tennessee and Penn State.

“The situation was extremely sim-
iliar; we had two starters out for the
PSU game, and we still won."

Then a sophomore, Ulana
Kohoutiak was out for six weeks
with leg injury.

Collier said, “We thought we
could do it again this year.”

Canadian-born Kohoutiak, con-
sidered one of the East’s top outside
hitters, said her team was again the
underdog.

“Penn State is a strong team, and
we didn’t have our setters,"she said
“I knew we had to make up for the
injuries in order to make it a com-
plete weekend; we had a bad match.
Next time, it will be on a different
level.“

Coach Collier concurred.

“Our younger players will come
through. We are aware that this is
not only a rivalry for the best team in
the East, but also many of the girls
from PSU and Pitt grew up in the
Pittsburgh area. With a little luck,
the right circumstances and a
healthy team, we will definitely play
a different — and better —— game.”

INSIGHTS  

INTO

 

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Design by
’ Robin O’Hara

Allocations Committee
——Athena Zaras

Each term, every full-time
student must pay a $24 activ-
ity fee along with tuition. One
fourth of the money goes to
the media, one fourth is used
by Pitt Program Council‘, and
the remaining one half,
amounting to $300,000, is
supplied to the Student
Government Board.

Nonetheless, $300,000 of
your money is handled by a
branch of Student Govern-
ment called the Allocations
Committee. Basically, the
committee makes recom-
mendations to the Student
Government Board concern-
ing the budgets, status and
privileges_of organizations on
campus. The committee allo-
cates the $300,000 to approx-
imately 100 recognized
student organizations on
campus.

During the winter term,
each organization must sub-
mit to the Allocations Com-
mittee a budget for the
following year. The budget
manager of each organiza-
tion meets with a member of
the committee assigned as
their liaison. From there,
after reviewing all the details
of almost 100 budgets, the
Allocations Committee
makes recommendations to
the Student Government
Board so that they may have
the final say as to whether an
organization’s request is or is
not granted. An organization

may appeal a d€C1S10n of the
Allocations Committee, but
the Board has the final
decision.

With the importance of

Allocations, one has to
wonder who spends three to
four hours a night, ﬁve days a
week, for about a month in
February doing such an
immense job. Currently, the
8 qualified members chosen
‘by interview are Chairper-
son, Steve Smith, William
Fox, Wendy Pekich, Mark
Stabingas, Ann O’Connor,
John Benchoff, Megan
Murphy, Hugh Henderson,
and as alternate, Pete
Petropoulos.

When the committee is not
reviewing budgets, it handles
emergency requests and cer-
tain price increases that may
create cause for budget mod-
ifications. The members
work continuously through-
out the term, but the most
intense time of year is when
the budgets are decided upon
in February.

Around Thanksgiving,
interviews will be held for new
committee members. Appli-
cations will be available in the
Student Government office.
So, if you are a business
major, or if you like to learn
policy and procedure, and
would like to get some first-
hand experience with finan-
ces, why not try the
Allocations Committee. As
Steve Smith, committee
chairperson, put it, “There’s
more to a college experience
than sitting in a classroom.”

Elections Committee
—Jim Brady

The Elections Committee
may at first glance appear to
be a small insignificant com-
mittee in student govern-
ment, however it serves a
very important function, one
which is vital in maintaining
the complete student govern-
ment body. The committee
must be made up of very
responsible individuals and
further, these individuals
must be prepared to put a
good deal of their time into
committee work during the
Fall term, especially during
the months of October and
November. It is the Election
Committee’s responsiblity to
set plans for, run and insure
the fairness of the Student
Government's election of
Board members and
President.

Meetings are held weekly
during the Fall term. During
the months of September
and October, meetings
acquaint the members with
the Elections Code (i.e.,pro—
cedures and regulations) and
active planning is conducted
by the members as a joint
body. By the end of October,
members serve as liaison
officers to candidates for the
Board, act as officials in over-
seeing the fairness of the elec-
tion, and serve in specialty
areas’ as necessary, such as
advertising or purchasing.
During the actual election,
which is held in November,

members open and close the

‘ voting stations, supervise

them, and serve as tabulators
when the polls are closed. It is
the Election Committee’s
resposibility to announce the
results of the election.

The committee is made up
of ten individuals, one‘ of
whom serves as chairperson.

All members are appointed.

by the Student Government
Board after an application
procedure has been con-
ducted. The Student
Government Board is also
responsible for appointing
the Election Committee
chairperson. Applicants
must not only apply, but also
undergo interviews by
members of the Student
Government Board which
also has great impact in
determining the applicants’
suitability. Because the com-
mittee must already be
formed by the Fall term, com-
mittee members are selected

during the Spring term of the

previous academic year.
(Editor’s Note: Jim Brady is
chairperson of Elections
Committee.)

Legal Awareness '
Committee

—Leslie Messineo

Are you interested in law?
Do you enjoy working with
people? Then Legal Aware-
ness is the place for you.

You need not have an

interest in law as a future
career to join LAC. In order
to become a member, a stu-
dent is required to complete
10 hous of office time. After
acceptance, two hours per
week is necessary to remain.a
member. '

The task of LAC is advising
on simple legal matters and
referring clients to attorneys
when professional help is
needed. Most cases handled
involve landlord/tenant dis-
putes such as recovering
security deposits and forcing
landlords to make needed
repairs.

One of our major problems
has been that enough stu-
dents are aware of our exist-
ence. We’re no substitute for
a lawyer when one is neces-
sary, but we can often help
someone who has nowhere
to turn.

‘D In recent months, we have
been contacting other stu-
dent legal services around
the country hoping to obtain
information on ways in which
our committee can be
improved.

(Editors Note: Leslie Messi-
neo is acting chairperson of
Legal Awareness.)

Student Relations
Committee

——Darci O’Hara

The Student Relations
Committee strives to inform
students about Student
Government and to encour-
age participation in all areas
of campus activities.

In the past, the committee
has sponsored Open
Houses, which created an
opportunity for interested
students to attend and ask
questions of active Student
Government members.

Presently, we are focusing
our attention on Insights. We
are optimistic that Insights
will prove to be a major vehi-
cle of communication
between Student Govern-

ment and the student popula-

tion.

We need writers,

made a huge red an green

editors, photographers and
artists to produce a quality
newsletter. If you are inter-
ested, please come to our
meetings on Mondays at
3:00.

The Student Organiza-
tions booklet, which lists all
groups recognized by the
Student Government Board,
was successfully printed and

distributed during the Fresh- .

men Activities Fair. The
freshmen seemed to wel-
come such a useful guide to
help them in choosing which
organizations they might
want to join.

We also plan to launch our
second annual charity drive
for Children’s Hospital in
November. Last year we sold
paper links, on which stu-
dents wrote thier names, and

chain which hung in the hos-
pital’s lobby during
Christmas.

The Student Relations
committee looks forward to
this term as a chance to
increase the visibility of Stu-
dent Government and to
create open lines of commun-
ication and information
between Student Govern-
ment and the student.

Academic Affairs
Committee

—BilI Davis

The Academic Affairs
Committee was created by
Student Government in
order to improve undergrad-
uate academics at Pitt.
Simply stated, we believe that
academics is what a univer-
sity is all about.

In the past, the committee
has worked on many pro-
jects, the most talked about
being our desire to institute
mandatory teaching evalua-
tions. As an interim step, the
committee has annually pub-
lished the Review of Course
Evaluatuions, a book consist-
ing of teaching evaluations
made available by the office
which administers these
surveys.

What we will do in the
future depends wholly on the
ingenuity, imagination and
hard work of our committee
members. Some ideas that I
have for the following semes-
ter, my first as chairperson,
are as follows:

Mandatory Teaching Eva-
luations - One of the keys to
improving academics is the
improvement of teaching. It is
important that all professors
be evaluated, and the ensuing
results made public. Stu-
dents have a right to know
what their peers think about
a given professor. After all,
aren’t we the ones who ulti-
mately pay their salary?
Advising — Complaints are
often raised, especially by
underclassmen, concerning
the present system of advis-
ing. Budget cuts have put a
tight squeeze on the advising
center, and so it may be time
to look for supplementary
means of advising.
Internships - The internship
ofﬁce has been another vic-
tim of budget cuts. We will
look at the effectiveness of
the ofﬁce, and the means
toward increasing student
participation in their offering.
Study Abroad - Although
Pitt prides itself on being an
international university, the
percentage of students who
study abroad is very small.
We would like to alter this
trend, and study the availabil-
ity of ﬁnancial aid to needy
students.

Used Books - While the cost
of textbooks continues to
rise, the efforts to counter
this trend continue to fall. We
are going to look into the pos-
sibilities for buying and selling
used books, what has been
done in the past, and what
needs to be done in the
future.

Recognition for Students,
Teachers - Everybody needs
a pat on the back sometimes.
We are considering an award
for outstanding teaching
presented by the student
body. For the students’ part,
we think it is ridiculous that
one needs to request a letter
denoting that a student has
made the Dean's list.
Withdrawral and Cre-
dit/No Entry Regulations -

We are planning a review of
these regulations to ensure
that they are fair and provide
adequate motivation for stu-
dents to try courses they
might not otherwise feel con-
fident enought to experiment
with.

Prep Courses Newly
beginning on campus, the dis-
count LSAT Prep Course is a
concept we would like to see
more of. Next in line should
be the MCAT, GMAT, and
GRE.

Scholarships - There are
scholarship opportunities out
there tha t both you and I
don’t know about. After
some research by the Aca-
demic Affairs Committee,
maybe some of us will have
and opportunity to find some
much needed financial
asistance.

Student Assembly - The
Student Government Board
has talked about reinstating
student assembly of campus
organizational representa-
tives as a forum for discus-
sion. We think this is a good
idea which should be acted
upon.

If you are a self-motivated
student interested in improv-
ing academics at Pitt, then we
hope you will join us. Mem-
bership is open to all those
who would like to become
involved. Meetings will be
open to the public, and most
likely held on a weekly basis.
Their times and dates are
presently undecided.
Members _willbe asked to
hold office hours at the Stu-
dent Government office, 638
William Pitt Union. If any of
the above ideas interests you,
or you have ideas of your
own, please don’t hesitate to
become involved. If you have
any questions, or would like
to become a member, stop in
the office or call us at X5920.
We will be looking forward to
hearing from you.

(Editors Note: Bill Davis is
chairperson of Academic
Affairs Committee.)

‘ And the Winner is...
—Pat Guardino

Last weekend, while most of us were at
parties in Oakland and at the football game
on Saturday, David Henninger and his sis-
ter, Kathy were living it up in New York
City.

Thanks go to the Student Government
Board, who sponsored the weekend trip to
New York as part of the William Pitt Union
grand opening.

Their agenda included dinner at the
Rainbow Room and the Broadway show,
Dreamgirls at the Imperial Theatre. Kathy
particularly enjoyed dinner. She said their
table overlooked Central Park, and “at
dusk, all the lights went on in the city.” It
was a beautiful sight, she said.

On Saturday afternoon, they walked
through Central Park, then went on to Sax
Fifth Avenue, Tiffany’s and Macy’s. Then
off to the Statue of Liberty and the Empire
State Building. 0

Of course, they saw some strange
things in the city. According to Kathy,
there were people on every street corner
selling “watches, sunglasses, everything
you could imagine.”

Kathy was excited about meeting the
Mama Leone. The Italian Restauranter
gave each of them a souvenir menu and
said, “You remember Mama!”

David and Kathy returned home Sun-
day afternoon. “We had the best time,”
Kathy said.

SGB Packs the William Pitt
—Darci O’Hare

The Suitcase Party on September 9th
turned out to be a huge success, packing
the Multi-Purpose Room for a celebration
of the end of the construction and renova-
tion of the William Pitt Union. The Student
Government Board held a drawing, in
which the winner and a guest were ﬂown to
New York City for an exciting weekend. In
order to be a contestant in the drawing,
you had to be packed and ready to to
immediately following the contest.

An estimated 400 students turned out to
dance to the upbeat music of the Flash-
cats. Tom Parks, a leading campus come-
dian, kept even the students who didn’t
win in stitches.

If the Suitcase Party is any indication of
future events, then the William Pitt Union
should prove to be as exciting a place as
the old Schenley Hotel.
