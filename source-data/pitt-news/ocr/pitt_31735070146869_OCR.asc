Letter from the editor a

For hundreds of Pitt students and alumni who have passed through campus over the last century, life at the University could be summed up in three words —— The Pitt
News. . . .

These cub reporters skipped classes'and hid in bushes to ﬁnd sources for their stories. These aspiring entrepreneurs walked up and down city streets selling ad-_
vertisements to local businesses. , ' '

For many of them, the paper was a way of life, and its staff was a second family.

Yet each person has a different perception of The Pitt News; a different memory that stands out the most. Alumni from the ’6os reminisce about a pet cat named
Feh and a Vagabond living in the office. A business manager from the ’30s remembered selecting models for a fashion show. Reporters from the ’9os focused on how
they uncovered corruption in Student Government Board. A ' .

How, then, do you write a story that sums up each group of people whoworked for The Pitt News and each era in the publication’s history?

You don’t. You allow the paper to tell its own story. This was_our vision for The Pitt News’ centennial edition.

We decided to dedicate a different story to each decade so that readers and alumni could track the changes in the paper and its staff.

We wanted to incorporate as many different voices from throughout the paper’s history as possible. ~ - . v

Reporters received their assignments earlier this month — they read through the archives to ﬁnd key news and sports stories and interviewed alumni who worked
at the paper during the decade’ they were ’covering"."The only exceptiori was made for the ‘repiorterwho cover'ed’the'i'§1os and 19205, ’beca‘use’we"did‘not know’ ofany
living alumni from those decades. . ' z .

Work on possible cover designs began around the same time. The staff hoped to celebrate 100 years of student reporting while also honoring the business side —
hence the Monopoly board in the background, an inside joke among current business staff members. I

Photo editors searched through archives with the help of other section editors to identify the best photographs and front pages from throughout The Pitt News’
history. What better way to capture the changes in the paper — and society as a whole — than to allow The Pitt News’ work to stand on its own?‘ ‘

We hope that our selections of stories and of images will adequately track the ups and downs of the Pitt football team, the protests against racial discrimination
on campus and the social turmoil that always seems to surround war. We hope that this issue will show how a student newspaper can track the evolution of a college
campus and also of society as a whole. '

Here’s hoping for another 100 years of Pitt News history!

Katherine Sandler
For The Pitt News

The Pitt News traces its roots back to Sept.

26, 1910, when a team of student report— ‘

ers published the ﬁrst issue of The Pitt
Weekly.

Before this issue, students relied on The
Courant, a monthly publication with strong
ties to the administration, for their cam-
pus news. With the implementation of the
Weekly, the paper reorganized itself as a
true student publication with “the intention

to publish  the real representative of the ,

student body.”

This ﬁrst “extra issue” was supplied at no
cost to readers, but future issues cost 5 cents
each. In the subsequent issues, staff mem—
bers covered “all. the features of the year,
including a full account of the ﬁrst football

“Although the weather was altogether
too hot for football some snappy work was
displayed and it was agreed by all that the

Football coverage consumed the front

a victory over Penn State on Thanksgiving

Readers could read the inscription on

the trophy, “The Spalding Trophy for com- '

petition in football between The University
of Pittsburgh and The Pennsylvania State
College.” «

Such competition among college “grid— _
, than.$200,000. Students, faculty, alumni
 and Chancellor Samuel McCormick wel-

ders” was expected because. “Western
Pennsylvania was the genesis of American

football,” said Robert Ruck, both an author
and history professor at Pitt.

“Pitt had the cream of crop” in coaches
like Glenn ‘Pop’ Warner, Ruck said.

The Panthers remained competitive for
years to come, winning national champion-
ships in 1915, 1916 and 1918, along with a
number of undefeated seasons in 1910, 1915,
1916, 1917 and 1920.

During the decade, most of Pitt’s home
games were played at Forbes Field on the
southeast end of the Oakland campus.

Other big news came during an annual
banquet at the University Club. Joseph C.

. Trees announced he would donate Pitt’s

very own stadium, gymnasium and track

located at the top of campus, behind where

Pennsylvania Hall stands today.

comed the dedication of Trees Stadium.

“We were there to thank Joe Trees for
providing his Alma Mater with one of the
most complete gyms and athletic ﬁelds in
the country,” the Weekly reported on Oct.
11, 1912.

During the run-up to the University’s
125th anniversary, Weekly staff members

A reported on the planning and organizing of
a three—day celebration. From Feb. 27 to 29,
1912, festivities occurred day and night.

According to Weekly coverage, faculty
and student groups worked in conjunction
preparing for this event. Students performed
a play, “The Vision of She Who Knows,” at
the banquet along with a historical presen-
tation of Pitt.

“Never since the founding of Pittsburgh
has such a banquet been held, or such a
crowd assembled at a banquet  Almost
all the alumni of Old Uni Pitt were on hand,
and a majority of the present student body

were there,” the Weekly reported in March
1912.

The Pitt Band led 1,500 students in a'

torchlight procession through the mud-rid- A ’

den and rainy Oakland streets to celebrate.
the 125th anniversary of the University. As
the procession reached Grant Boulevard
the line swooped around to form the let-
ters “U. of P.” -

The parade ended in a massive bonﬁre
celebration, where “the whole body danced
a weird snake dance around the ﬁre,” one
reporter wrote on Feb. 28, 1912.

Thereafter, Pitt declared its anniversary
as a holiday. *

Another big news event during the de-
cade lasted longer than three days — for
ﬁve weeks in October and November of 1918,
students were quarantined and classes can-
celed because of a ﬂu outbreak.

Headlines for those ﬁve weeks ran in big

THE 1920s

Katherine Sandler
For The Pitt News

During the Roaring ’20s, Pitt’s
Oakland campus expanded its
domain both outward across the
Schenley Farms district and up-
ward with the start of ambitious
construction projects like the Ca-
thedral of Learning.

. The Pitt Weekly covered Uni-
versity expansion and much more
during the decade, including big
football victories and big econom-
ic defeats in the closing moments
of the ’20s.

In 1924, Chancellorjohn Bow-
man gave an address to “one of
the largest mass meetings in the
history of the University,” regard-
ing the plans of the proposed
52-story, 650—foot Cathedral of

Chancellor Bowman:

ing $100,000.

Other individuals, alumni, in-
dustries, corporations and local
organizations also contributed
to the project.

As the Weekly reported in
1925, the Cathedral was not the
only major building project dis-
cussed during the decade.

Pitt Stadium was formally
dedicated at the Pitt versus Car-
negie Tech game on Saturday, Oct.
24, 1925, in front of a crowd of
48,000. The new stadium could
hold more than 70,000 people.

The football team met Presi-
dent Herbert Hoover at the end of
the 1929 season. That season also
saw the initiation of the bonﬁre
and torchlight celebrations that
have continued every year until
today.

Students, faculty and alumni
gathered at Soldiers & Sailors
Memorial Hall to hear him speak
of the building, which could hold
12,000 students and scores of
classrooms, ofﬁces, libraries,
shops, laboratories and recre-
ational centers.

“The building is to be a cathe-
dral of learning, a great central
symbol, which makes the heart
leap up and understand Pitts-
burgh,” Chancellor Bowman said
at the time.

Staff reporters regularly pub-
lished updates on the Cathedral’s
fundraising campaign. $10 mil-
lion was needed to fully fund the
construction. .

The Weekly brought a chance
for students to participate in larg-

of the ’20s.

On Monday, March 24, 1929,
The Pitt Weekly distributed bal-
lots issued by another student
paper, The Harvard Crimson, to
gauge University opinions of the
debate surrounding ongoing alco-
hol prohibition and its standing
with the 18th Amendment.

Along with 25 other participat-
ing universities, Pitt’s paper ran
a sample ballot the week before
the national vote to gauge opin-
ions of prohibition, in order for
students and faculty to prepare
for the types of questions.

Students checked off yes or no

dents and 11,000 students across the na-
tion voted for this. Nearly 6,000 students
urged total repeal nationwide, including
900 Panthers.

The Weekly also published the largest
issue in its history with its special Ohio
State edition published Nov. 1, 1929. '

“Smashing all previous records for cir-

V culation, number of pages and volume of

Pittsburgh advertising, the Ohio State issue
of The Pitt Weekly  caused a sensation in
many University circles,” according to the
top story in the next week’s issue.

The 12-page record-breaker came out
the day before the Panthers’ ﬁrst—ever
matchup with the Buckeyes and featured
a number of game predictions and head-
shots of coaches and players.

“A total of 347 inches of local advertis-
ing was printed, beating by 141 inches the
previous mark of 206 inches,” the paper
reported the next week, after the Panthers
won the game 18-2. _

That advertising success was not a
one—time thing. According to the Nov. 8
edition, the Weekly’s business staff made
tremendous strides during the later years
of the ’20s, launching the paper into a new
decade.

“Despite the handicap of a department
store combine cutting off a large volume,
of Pittsburgh advertising, and an unusu-
ally small volume of national advertis-
ing, the editions so far have been replete
with sufficient material to place The Pitt
Weekly among the largest collegiate news-

When Morton Weissman thinks of his time
working for The Pitt News, he does not
think ﬁrst of the stories that recounted
how students called for peace leading up to
World War II, of how his peers attempted
to oust fraternity brothers from student
government or of how the University was

accused of censoring the paper.

Weissman, the business manager’ in
1939, thinks ﬁrst of coeds and bar ﬁghts.
One of Weissman’s predecessors in the‘

1 ’30s convinced a local department store to

help the paper run a style show, the term
of the times for a fashion show.

“As business manager of The Pitt News,
we had our pick of models,” said Weissman,
who at 92 is one of the oldest living Pitt
News alumni.

Men were reluctant to participate -
though the paper did recruit at least one
football player. But in the days leading up
to the big event, women on campus would
come’ to Weissman’s office and offer to help

Isaid, ‘I don’t ask them

just look at them.’ '

him with work in exchange for a chance to
be in the show.

One day, a student told Weissman he was
going to get in trouble. He was picking too
many models from the same sorority.

The paper came out about three times a
week then. Weissman spent his time court-
ing advertisers — many were cigarette
companies — while trying to,“keep the

paper in the black” ﬁnancially, something-

that was very hard during that era.

The editorial staff focused largely on
covering on—campus events and sometimes
connected them to national and interna-
tional events. In 1934, it ran an article
about a lecture in which Dr.]. F. L. Raschen
discussed the rise of dictator Adolf Hitler
in Germany and predicted that war would
break out in Europe. ‘

Two. years later, the University curtailed
classes and joined in a national peace day
assembly. p ' if

The same year, The Pitt News ran an
article about the annual Coed Prom, a tra-
dition in which freshmen women attended
a dance with senior women. “Dates Scarce

_ Tonight as Coeds Date Coeds,” the headline
read. The story described characters like
“Miss Freshman in her purty blue and gold
garden hat, made with her own hands, and
dressed in her summer formal.”
Women’s rights were an area of focus
throughout the decade. Women earned
their ﬁrst seat on the Student Council in
1933, with the passage of “The Goldberg
Amendment” to the group’s constitu-
tion.
At the end of the decade, women con-
tinually made headlines as the members

of sororities debated whether to abandon .

campus politics.

Some articles angered the Pitt admin-
istration,-and in 1937 an independent or-
ganization said the University’s method
for choosing the paper’s editor in chief
was “dictatorial.”

The Intercollegiate Newspaper Associa-
tion came to this conclusion after sending
questionnaires to editors and assistants

As the campus speculated

often the paper came out and then
said, “Wouldn’t you like to have it

Weissman said no, and Bow-

Yet despite the occasional
high-profile story and high-
pressure meetings with Pitt of-
ﬁcials, the staff still found time
to have fun.

Onjan. 23, 1931, the paper ran
an article called “Three Journal-

“Journalists may, or may not make

A decade of war still bright for students

Mallory Grossman
Staﬁ Writer

In the midst of 1ife—altering
events like the start of World War
II and the Pearl Harbor attacks,
The Pitt News managed to cover
race discrimination, housing
shortages and fashion contests
during the ’4os. .

Although the paper was able
to maintain light-hearted cover-
age throughout the decade, much
of the reporting from the first
half of the ’40s centered around
World War II.

When the United States en-
tered the war in 1941, The Pitt
News covered its impact on the

University. ‘

' Genevieve Wilson, one of the
few women working as a report-
er at The Pitt News in the ’40s,
recently said she remembers
soldiers’ constant presence on
campus, some of them essentially
“living in the Cathedral.”

“I saw them every day and was
very aware that they were there,”
Wilson said. I

In the issue that came out on
Dec. 10, 1941, The Pitt News re-
ported about the “sunless, grey
Tuesday” that America entered
the war. ~

It was the day that “grim
young faces, calm, serious, in-
dicated that boys had suddenly
become men, girls had become

women,” The Pitt News wrote.

their classes while professors

that I know of in Pittsburgh is
the character of the student body

a blackout, but the students will
ﬁnd their way through,” Bow-

man said.

'In an issue that came out ex-
actly one year after Pearl Harbor,
The Pitt News called World War

breaking, of what may be the
greatest revolution in American
education yet written into the
history books.” I ‘

_ The war affected many parts
of student life. Veterans totaled
80 percent of the new class in
1946, gasoline rationing affected
50 percent of the student body’s
method of transportation in
1943, air-raid safety instructions
were put out for students in 1941,

editorial said. V

Throughout the decade, Pitt
students were not afraid to speak

their minds and fight for what

they believed. “Only a young
America can hate war itself so
greatly that they will fight for a
brave new world,” it said.
Despite the gravity and trag-
edies of World War II, students
still found a way to enjoy the col-
lege experience. .

tographer for The Pitt News and

James Pettican — a columnist

of issues — also remembered
The Pitt News as a fun job that
helped him to develop his skills

around campus during the decade. In 1941,
the Pitt basketball team met North Caro-
lina in the ﬁrst round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, and in 1946 Pitt joined the Big Ten
conference for all of its sports.

Other sexual health and race issues also
occupied The Pitt News staff.

In April of 1941, Pitt offered all students
free Wasserman Tests, which checked their
blood for the existence of syphilis.

The Men and Women’s Health Ser-
vices offered the test in cooperation with
The Pitt News and the Pittsburgh Syphilis
Control Board as a preventative and edu-
cational measure.

In 1942, The Pitt News covered the
committee set up to study the Pitt Band’s
race policy, with regard to the admission

of black students into the organization.

The administration set up the commit-
tee to deal with the exclusion of Charles

Rickmond, a black student who was denied
entrance into the band.

The band explained to Rickmond that

nization because “it would hamper the

A decade that rocked the American social
structure, the ’5os brought The Pitt News’
coverage to the forefront of previously
unexplored social issues.

The transition into a decade rife with
political and societal conﬂicts like the Cold
War and rock ’n’ roll inﬂuenced the content
of The Pitt News during the ’5os, but so
did local scientiﬁc breakthroughs like the
development of the polio vaccine.

In the semiweekly editions, writers
would cover national issues such_as ra-
cial and gender discrimination, but some-
times, events on campus would make na-
tional news.

Onjan. 18, 1956, The Pitt News covered
Jonas Salk in an article titled, “Salk suc-
ceeds Fitzgerald as Jaycee ‘Man.’”

Salk, who developed the polio vaccine
in 1955, was named “Man of the Year” by
the Junior Chamber of Commerce, also
known as Jaycee, in 1956 for his progress
in the polio epidemic.

“[1955] saw increased activity in the
administration of the Salk vaccine de-
signed to end polio, with news that over
6.5 million people in the U.S. and millions
more in Canada and Denmark had received
the polio vaccine, developed by Pitt’s emi-
nent scientistjonas Salk,” Irving Rothman,
news editor in 1955, said in an e—mail.

The office brimmed with excitement
during the 1950s.

“There was a lot of c1ickity—clacking
going on in The Pitt News office,” said
David Green, news editor of The Pitt News
in 1954. The newspaper staff wrote all of
its articles onmanual typewriters.

During his time at The Pitt News, Green
did not have the luxury of using the tech-
nology that many journalists employ to-
day. Instead of using cell phones, he did
face-to-face interviews. Instead of typ-
ing on a computer, he wrote stories on a
typewriter. ,

“We didn’t even have a voicemail back,
then,” Green said.

Reporters continuously called sources
to get the required information for their
stories.

They also left messages with secretar-
ies when necessary. Although individuals
atop the hierarchy, such as the chancellor
and the dean, were easier to get in touch
with in the 1950s.

V On March 3, 1954, an article titled, “Se-
nior Coed,” was published as a reminder of
the upcoming announcement of nominees

the Senior Queen selection process.

S _‘.‘It can be argued that there should be
no such ultimate selection since it is said
that the Queen represents allother se-
nior girls and they crown themselves at

' the same _time,"’the reporter wrote. “.It is -

paradoxical to single out one woman as

the ideal, and then say she represents all

other women.”

On Nov. 30, 1951, The Pitt News printed
a poll that showed that out of 609 under-

graduate men and 157 undergraduate, 527 7

men and 167' women said they wanted to

add women to the cheerleading team.
Occasionally, The Pitt News’ push for

social equality led to conflict between stu-

Assistant News Editor

5 Some people remember the ’6os

as atime of free love and radical
expression. Others struggle to
remember the decade at all.

The people who worked at '

The Pitt News during the ’6os
remember at least one thing —

_ a resident office cat named Feh.

. Barry Gross, the news editor
from 1962-63, said a cat named
Feh called The Pitt News office
home, at least for a while.

Named for the sound of dis-
gust one makes when nearing a
litter box, Feh was booted out

i when the cleaningcrew decided

to rescind his welcome.
A Feh was later replaced with
a stray Pitt News staff member
who left his parents’ house only
‘to move into the office.
‘ “He got a drawer in the ﬁling
cabinet,” Gross said. The vaga-
bond crashed on the couch for at
least a couple of months. Gross
said hewas not sure where the
‘stray showered. , A
Although the atmosphere
at the ofﬁce was «light 4 Gross
said the staff “didn’t really hold
meetings, and people who want-

» ed to write would drift in  the

content of the semi-weekly pa-

Gross said The Pitt News tried
to keep its focus on student life.

.It was an attempt to cover all
of the campus happenings that
led Gross to The Pitt News. He ac-
companied a friend who worked
for the newspaper to the fourth
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union
—.then called Schenley Hotel
— only to see the news section

cover a lecture. -
“Is that like taking notes in

ment. . . A 1961, she told the ﬁrst person she ran into “My eyes got really big, and I knew

that’s what I wanted to do,” she said.

After getting hired, Nichols didn’t get
much time to acclimate herself to the life
of a photojournalist.

“He put 15 pounds of stuff on me and
said, ‘Go get ‘em, Flash,”’ Nichols said.

Armed with a Speed Graflex camera,
Nichols covered the important events of
campus. She said she became the first
female photo editor in 1962.

The distinction of forging the path for
female photographers didn’t really dawn
on Nichols.

“I didn’t think, ‘Oh, I’m a woman be-
coming a photography editor,”’ Nichols
said. A ’

Nichols spent 40 hours a week in the
office, but when she wasn’t rolling a bottle
up and down the hall to dissolve develop-
ing chemicals with hot water, she was out
photographing the musicians and activists
who came to Pitt. ~

Feminist Betty Friedan and Indian sitar
player Ravi Shankar were some of the big
names Nichols captured on ﬁlm.

Gross remembered when Shankar
—— the ’60s’ trendiest hippie —— came to
town. It was kind of an inside joke for
the writers.

“Oh, Ravi Shankar’s here again,” they’d
grumble good—naturedly. Gross said Shan-
kar came to Pitt so frequently he almost
became old news. - ‘

Gross, who graduated in 1963, said he
2  OF   2   missed out on the decade’s biggest year
for news, 1964.
- Although Gross remembers covering
DP    ‘the controversial topic of adding park-
’ ' ing meters to the parking lot in what is
now Schenley Plaza, Gross said he missed
out on the activism that surrounded the
Vietnam War. I

The Pitt News reported in the Sept. 13,
1968, edition that every week in Pitts-
burgh, three men drafted for the Vietnam
War did not show up for induction.

“The late President Kennedy once’men~
tioned he hoped that one day the man who
resists the draft will be given the same
honors as the warrior. The members of the
resistance are helping to make this dream
a reality,” The Pitt News reported.

er things The Pitt News was con-
cerned about, such as the decline
of campus sports programs.

Jay Rosenstein, who worked
in the sports section of The -Pitt
News from 1964-68, said he
worked during _“the worst of
times.”

During his years at Pitt, the
football team went 3-27.

The basketball team wasn’t
much better.

Fans are now known as the
Oakland Zoo, but in the ’60s, a
different kind of animal was at
the games.

Rosenstein, who was sports

editor his ﬁnal year working for
the paper, remembered when a
“fan” threw a dead fish onto the

court.
With only 300 to 500 people

attending, theigames were a quiet

preparing to play West Virginia,
students appointed patrols in Li-

tchﬁeld Towers to watch out for
enemy destruction. ‘

West’ Virginians would sneak
onto campus and attempt to van-
dalize Towers. '

Just as students protested for
civil rights and gender equal-
ity, The Pitt News also covered
protests for a better sports pro-
gram. I . ‘
The football team caused a

stronger new coach and anim-
proved recruiting system.

When the politics ‘of an unpopular war
began to affect campus, The Pitt News was
there to report it.

,“It was not uncommon to have-dem-
onstrations because of the Vietnam War,?’
Lederman said. “Nor was it uncommon
for groups of thousands to gather on the
Cathedral lawn to hear different people
speak.” « r ' ’

The Pitt News often participated in the
outspoken politics of the decade, occasion-

' On Nov. 7, 1922', the date of Nixon’s re-
election, The Pitt News ran a completely
black page with a whitevheading that read
“Four More Years.” p

_ ‘A year later, The Pitt News demanded
that Nixon be removed from office.

‘The front cover, which was a completely

black page with the question, “Three More

Years?” expressed doubt,over—Nixon’s abil-

ity to continue to hold office.
“Today, on the anniversary of President
Nixon’s re—election, we have reached an

impasse. The American people’s disillu- ’

sionment_with their government is so com-

plete that there remains only two courses P

of action: resignation or impeachment.”
Feminist views were also visible on
campus. /
In 1971, professor Ina Braden sued
Pitt claiming that her employment was

-terminated because of affiliations with

the Universitycomrnittee for Women’s
Rights. ' ~ '

“Pitt is accused of hiring women at a
lower rank and pay then-[sic] men of simi-
lar qualiﬁcations, giving smaller wages
to women than to men of similar quali-.
fications, failing to promote women to

' higher professional rank,” The Pitt News

reported. a

The Pitt News also wrote about another
underrepresented community at the time
— homosexuals.

An Oct. 15, 1975, article recounted the
story of Nancy, who told_people she was
a lesbian. “I want to go far in business.

“Two Pitt students were wounded Dec.
19 when their Semple Street apartment
building was sprayed with bullets from a
.22-caliber semi-automatic riﬂe,” The Pitt
News said in its Jan. 9, 1985, edition. “Po-
lice were also ﬁred upon as they arrived at
the scene.” . .

According to The Pitt News, the incident
was triggered by a domestic dispute, and
Richard Marchese Jr. shot at and wounded

Sciences. 2 V _.

The students recovered, and there was

“Almost everyone is touched by and is
close to a gay or lesbian person in their ‘lives,
whether they know it or not. It upsets me
when students just assume that the people
they associate with are straight,” Smith
said. - ‘

Some other ‘exciting events The Pitt News
covered included Dan Marino returning Pitt
football to its glory years, Starzl performing
liver transplants andJerome Lane shattering
the backboard in what is considered the best

Though the office had the benefit of the
Internet, there were only two “connected”
computers and so information was hardly
at the staff ’s ﬁngertips. Mark Gordon, the

1995 news editor, explained that, for they 9

old—fashioned way. ‘ _ ~
“Back then, we.had to go out and ﬁnd
the story,” said Gordon, who is currently

the managing editor of Gulf Coast Busi-

ness Review. .

Gordon had to pull many levers to get
all the information possible for a piece.
During his time as news editor, for in-
stance, a story broke about an incident
that took place at a party. An Oct. 17, 1994,
article read: “A Pitt student, 19, has told

a fraternity party by a gang of males who
charged into the bathroom when she was
involved in intimate relations with an-
other man.”

. This-‘ was an unusually troublesome
piece, and ‘when Gordon found the police
report, the first line read simply “While
at frat party, girl was assaulted.” The next
four lines were blanketedtwith white out.

Eventually, however, Gordon managed to

establish the details.

“I eventually ‘developed a relationship
with the new police chief and six months
later was able to get" him to speak on the
record,” Gordon said. I T

Sara Pecora
For The Pitt News

The 2000s were a frantic decade for the
nation — and The Pitt News.

With 24-hour news coverage on TV, radio
and the Internet, the paper shouldered
the unenviable burden of providing for an
increasingly media—hungry college demo-
graphic. —

“To be a 19-year-old reporter, cover-
ing political rallies or the dual election-
night parties  and to stay at the paper
until 6 am.‘ trying to ﬁgure out who our
president was  all ofit was just incredibly

the assistant news editor during the 2000
elections.

“Breaking an important front-page story
and standing in the elevator as complete
strangers read your work provides an in-
credible rush,” said Hartman, who went
on to become the 2002-03 editor in chief.
“The idea that our news storiesand editori-
als actually impacted University‘ decisions
served as an incredible motivator to give
the paper everything I had.”   T ’ ~ ~ 0

Hartman wasnft alone in thissentiment.
Doug Denison, the 2007-08’ news‘ editor,
