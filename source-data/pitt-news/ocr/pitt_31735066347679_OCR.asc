The Pains
And Gains
Of Jogging

(Continued from Page 8)

For strained muscles, Hyner
recommends cold packs. For
sprains, he says there are three
steps—cold, compress and eleva-
tion.

The benefits of jogging are not
limited to getting in shape.

“Jogging is tremendous for the
cardio-vascular system,” Hyner
says.

“You get outside instead of
sitting in your room. It’s beautiful
down in Schenley Park. You start
to recognize the other joggers. It’s
really friendly.”

Some things happen that are not
so nice. Once, a carload of high
school girls -tried to run the
foursome down, Joan got chased by
a Doberman Pinscher and an overly
amorous male gave Linda a slap on
the backseat. But they're sticking
it out with gusto.

“I read an article on jogging in
Cosmopolitan and it said that
after you really get into condition, a
body chemical is released and
produces a natural high,” Diane
said. “We haven’t built up to that,
I haven’t got high yet,.but I’ll let
you know when it happens.”

In the meantime, they’ll just
have to be content to jog for their
health.

Pershing Riﬂes:
All in a Day’s Trick

excited about being in it. When
you’re on the floor, you’re kind of
oblivious to what’s going on around
you. You’re giving your utmost
attention to what you’re doing. You
have to concentrate.’

“But I really got nervous when I
saw those other people standing off
to one side of the ﬂoor, the people
who had already been eliminated. It
was a scary feeling.”

Hard as it may sound, IDR isn’t as
hard, Tussing believes, as the
two-man trick competition.

“In a two-man trick,” Tussing
noted, “you really have to watch
what you’re doing, while in IDR
you’re out there with a group. In
two-man, well, it’s just you and the
other guy. You really have to pay
attention to everything you’re
doing.”

and Mark Walley represented Pitt,
Each, along with Bill Gallishen, was
an earlier cut in the IDR
competition.

Combining a routine involving
riﬂe flips and precise drill
movement (or stract, in drill
terminology), Grant and Walley
executed their routine. Although
they finished sixth in the seven-
team competition, they missed a
medal by one place——the top five
teams received medals.

“We added a few more ﬂips and
movements toour routine, Walley
said. “It increased the difficulty of
our routine. We slowed our routine
down to make it appear as though
we had more stract.

“Stractness and difficulty are
what meets are basically judged
on,” Walley continued. “We did
our best.”

Voitko would certainly agree with

that.

and a minimum of 0 months

commitment to one child.

“Summer vacations and gradua-
tions are a problem, but the two
persons involved ﬁgure it out,”
Miller said.

“You even have to constantly
explain why you can only meet once
a week,” Lalama said, adding,
“but the kids should feel they can
call you for help anytime.”

Discipline is a problem because
the youths have problems already.
“You have to be subtle about it, you
say things like, ‘You have the rest of
your life to smoke, so why are you
doing it now?’ ”

Lalama said tutoring was run in
the same way: “We take them
bowling so theyccan learn to add.”

“It’s enjoyable,” she added.
“You couldn't stay in it if it
wasn’t.”

Miller said, “When I started, it
was mainly to keep in touch with the

other world. It’s a challenge to meet ’ if

these problems.” T
The program, which started in

1974, has 25 volunteers helping the —

same number of youths. The
volunteers are mostly undergrads at
Pitt, in addition to policemen and
some childless married ‘couples.

“There are problems matching
the supply and demand,” Miller
said. “We have volunteers waiting
for kids and the program has kids,
mostly boys, waiting for big
brothers.”

Lalama and Miller both suggest- ..

ed the program to anyone going into
some type of social work. “You

learn how the social system works, ” -

Miller said.

Harris as Dickinson

Giving From One’s Heart

I By" RON NYSWANER

The Belle of Amherst
Directed by Charles Nelson Reilly

In the same era that Ralph
Waldo Emerson was charging
young scholars to begin a literary
renaissance, to become “trans-
parent eyeballs" so to see (and be)
Truth in Nature, and Walt
Whitman traveled what to him
seemed to be a newly born country,
one that inspired songs written for
the poet, the worker and the land
itself. Emily Elizabeth Dickinson
wrote: .

I never saw a Moor-
] never saw the Sea-

Yet I know how the Heather looks
and what a wave must be.

I never spoke with God
Nor visited in Heaven—
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the Chart were given.

Julie Harris. as Dickinson in
“The Belle of Amherst," (which
played Carnegie Music Hall Mon-
day night) said. “I never had to go
anywhere..._my paradise is right
here...Paradise is within."

To talk about “The Belle of
Amherst" is to talk about a
performance, about poetry and

about feelings. These cannot be
separated. Harris did not portray
Dickinson or “become" her as a
good method actor would do. She
gave the part of herself the poet
would have her give: her heart.
“A good heart." Harris said, with
echoes of Dickinson sharing her
expression, “is the principle
thing." '
“The Belle of Amherst" com-
poses Dickinson's life on that basis:
that beyond events—deaths, rejec-
tions, the baking of cakes or the
writing of poems—there is a

feeling about them. Uccurences
were only important to Emily
Dickinson because she felt some-
thing about them. Julie Harris
made the distant happenings in a
poet's life important in this same
way.

Turning out of the offstage
kitchen. carrying Dickinson's fam-
ous black cake. Harris greeted the
audience, that afternoon's guest, to
the Dickinson “Homestead“:
“Welcome to Amherst." She

offered a recipe and described her.

own eccentricity. She scuttled from
one subject to another, unsure if
she felt glad to have been called
upon so early in the day, with so
much yet to do.

That is “The Belle of Amherst."

Her youth betrayed the shy
recluse Dickinson became in
middle age. Standing on a chair,
Harris sang some nasty sections of

delighting in publicly pronouncing
them, then daring:

‘ ‘How do you

But shy, and certainly a recluse,
Dickinson became. Losses—of
those she loved or of the hope of
becoming a published author-
quieted her passion:

My life closed ‘twice before its close——
It remains to see

If immorality unveil

A third event to me

So huge, so hopeless to conceive
As these that twice befell
Parting is all we know of heaven,
And all we need of hell.

go beyond the “fair” grades
created by most art historians-—
weekend painters. _
Summers’ dominant canvas, a
portrait of ﬁne arts graduate
student Jennifer Wilson, is breath-
taking partly because of its slightly

tilted askew perspective, and‘

larger than life quality, partly
because of his splendid mastering
of surface color-light play.

It becomes a work of basic
lushness, both ﬁguratively and
literally. The real quality of natural
light that plays over and highlights
his color composition, together
with the green background vegeta-
tion framing the student gels into
pure visual delight. ‘ _ 

His backyard péiﬁ°ﬁ'ﬁ§‘6t”§ winter
scene is similarly a feast of color
inflection. Here, Summers weaves
white snow crusted on lackluster
brown branches throughout his
work in a compositional arrange-

ment that activates the viewer's
_ eye to every part of its surface.
In his still life composition using
Giant Eagle foodstuff props done
under canned light, Summers turns
a pastiche of glaring, garish
coloration into an actually pleasing.
I harmonious network of shapes and
tones. .
But despite these fresh appeal-
ing works, a stiff, formal approach
that saddles most art historians is
evident. In his concern over
technicalities (for technical solu-
tions are what Summers is primarily
exploring here) the artist some-
times neglects to impart the breath
He is interested in light and
k shade tonalities, which he achieves
/at times "with brilliant technique.
He is interested in the brushwork
over his canvas surface. which out
of mottled messiness emerges an
appealing, visually-tactile texture.
He is‘ interested in good composi-

tion of his forms, which he
composes correctly. But in many
works, the ﬁnal product freezes
into a staid rendition of realism.

Many of Summers’ ﬁgures are

stiff. He repeats the sitting poses
in his portraits too often throughout
this exhibit without any signiﬁcant
compositional alteration to revive
viewer interest. The starkness of
most of Summers’ backgrounds
makes for empty canvases livened
only by a superb use of color.

One misses an abberration, a
shot in the dark and unformal
concern that would mark his work
for its daringness.

Of course, this criticism is unfair
to give a person whose artistry is in
a second vocation. But then too,
with Summer’s quality of work, it
would take only a slight push to
peak the horizon that would make
him a full-fledged artist, as well as
historian. in his own right.

Half Baked Without Bread  

By TOM WASELESKI

Lost Without Your Love
Bread ’
Electra Records, 7E-1094

David Gates is finally back after a
deservedly ill-fated solo stint, but
all we have here is more of the
sugar-coated pop that set the back
windows of souped-up Chevys
,steamin’ in the early '70s.

Seldom has a group been able to
puff an album around a couple of
catchy singles the way Bread has
and most undoubtedly will do the
same with this one.

' The current single, the title track,
is typical nasal David Gates stuff,
tuned out in the “Aubrey,” “Sweet
Surrender" vein. It may take some
time before Gates and Co. can ever
match their single contribution to
rock music made relatively early in
their career, “If,” a songthat is
nothing short of musical poetry.

“Lost Without Your Love” is

' lyrically bankrupt and.the_quality of I

Hr...-. x,v -..

 

Gates’ voice can be likened to the
emotional statements found in
greeting cards.

The album’s opener, “Hooked on
You, ” is much ofthe same and if the
current single makes it big, the odds
are this one "will be the follow-up.
Both songs have_ that breezy.
summery sound Bread is famous
for. But "at times the breeze
becomes too much wind and after
the seven or so years this band's
been around, one asks, “How much
longer?”

“The Chosen One” is probably
the only quality Gates tune on the
record. Opening with a soft electric
strum that amazingly resembles the
one that opens “Yes” and “You
and I" (honest), the band shows
some strong acoustic moves before
moving into a more charged chorus.

Gates‘ vocal, too. is not left lying
around, intoning sentimental cli-

ches‘ as through his nose. On the

verses he is straightforward, almost
mundane, buthe belts it out on the.

refrains. _.r.e_aching_Vthe high» side.of_ .

 

the scale and adding some

broadness to the tune. This would .

be an excellent single; some of the
FM stations have picked up on this
one already.

The better writing on the album is I

handled by the band's rockers,
James Griffin and Robb Royer.
“She’s the Only One” and “Fly
Away” are well placed on the
record, serving to break up Gates’
pabulum. The group's guitar work
gets a chance to show its muscle on
the more electrifying cuts, , and
although Bread is still in a class with
America-type soft rockers, these
guys know how to play it.

“Our Lady of Sorrows’ ’ is another
beautiful Grifﬁn/Royer collabora-
tion. The lyrics have a respectable
mentality to them, the rhythm is
tight and the vocals are clean. Gates
keeps his schlock out of the cut and
the rest of the band proves here, as
it probably does throughout the rest
of the record, that Gates‘ needs

Harris Stars In ’Amherst’

declared her American true “trans-
parent eyeball," our renaissance
spirit.

Harris is different in “The Belle

‘of Amherst" than in most of the

roles that have characterized her
career. Typically she seems brittle
and fragile; a misunderstood, often
ignored, glass creature. The clarity
of that glass has been the strength
of her past performances.

As Dickinson, the glass has
melted, becoming ﬂuid, much
more difficult to break. Her voice
Her eyes
bounced and even glared. As the
poet, she had to become strong; for
certainly strength belonged to
Emily Dickinson.

She made us feel that strength,
as well as the pain, the delight, the
resignation and the hope Emily
Dickinson felt. Dickinson gave her
feelings in poems. Harris
transferred them by performance.
“When I feel, physically,” Dick-
inson said, “as if the top of my
head was taken off—I know that
was poetry."

But Harris was not simply the
form into which the content of
Dickinson’s life was placed. Great

tion, but a sharing of realized

Harris touched the feelings of
Dickinson, then held up her own
similar ones. that the audience
might touch them in turn. A,-A

INDIA’S TRANSFER OF
POVVER BEGINS

NEW DELHI, India (AP)-
India’s winning political combin-
ation prepared yesterday to take
over the government in two days
while its leaders jockeyed for the
post of prime minister.

A decision on the top spot was
expected to be reached by
Thursday morning in time for the
swearing-in of the new government
later that day.

Preparations for the transfer of
power went forward after Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi formally
resigned yesterday, along with her
cabinet, ending her 11-year rule.
Near-ﬁnal returns from last week-
end’s elections showed her oppo-

nents had won a decisive majority. .

“The collective judgment of the
people must be respected." Mrs.
Gandhi said in a statement to the
nation. “My colleagues and I
accept their verdict unreservedly
andin a spirit of humility.”

The two leading candidates to

succeed her as prime minister were‘

former deputy prime minister
Morarji Desai, 81, chairman of the
victorious Janata Peoples’ party,
and former agriculture minister
Jagiivan Ram, 68, head of the
Congress for Democracy party.

the meet, D’Amico expressed the

“The competition and may have reached
that goal if an old nemisis—injury—
hadn’t gone along for the trip also.

“Generally, the teams that beat
us had more depth,” D’Amico said.
“We could have moved up two more
places but we couldn’t- use Rob
Pasterick (the Panthers’ best
all-around performer and team
scoring leader). He’s had this
chronic shoulder injury this year
and he couldn't compete.”

Trying to pick up the slack left by
the loss of Pasterick, senior Don
Stevenson took part in all six of the

‘compulsory all-around events Fri-
day. The strain of that attempt was
evident on the second day of the
competition, however, and Steven-
son was forced to drop out after only
three events.

The Eastern Championships are
run differently than a regular
season contest. The competitors
must perform compulsory exer-
cises, which are not done during
dual meets. ’ These compulsories
are the same as those done at the
Olympic Games and are difficult to
master. This year only 10 schools
felt competent enough to make the
trip to Illinois to compete.

D’Amico also pointed out the lack
of consistency in the scoring of the
routines. According to the coach,

D’Amico said. Tom Biers (a leading
Panther on the-ﬂoor exercises) did a
routine in the compulsories and
received a 6.75. He easily deserved
a 7.5.”

Other Panther gymnasts turning
in worthwhile performances were
Doug Smith, who notched a career
high 38.95 in the all-around; Keith
Wipperecht, who earned a 36.1 in
the all-around; and Ken Lunz, who
contributed some fine routines in
his first college meet.

“Everybody tried to do what they
could and gave it a try,” D’Amico
said. You don’t start at the top; you
start at the middle or the bottom and
work your way up. That is what we
are doing now.”

 lnexperienced Gymnasts Lessoned

Now finished with their best year
in recent history, the Pitt gymnasts
are looking to the future and,
according to D’Amico, that future is
bright.

“Next year’s group will have a
year’s experience with compulsor-
ies so we will be focusing our
workouts on those moves,”
D’Amico said. “Again, you can’t go
into the meet without knowing
them. We’ll work on them a lot this
next year so they will be old hat to
us.”

“This was the first time in many
years Pitt has been to the Eastern
Championships,” D’Amico added.
“We’ll be back next year. I’m sure
we will.’_’

Pitt's synchronized swim team
was in for a pleasant surprise when
it arrived at , University Park to
compete in the Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Invitational syn-
chronized swim meet last weekend.

The Aquettes, competing in their
first competitive meet of the season,
were surprised to see a comment
made by Penn State synchronized
swim coach Marilyn Eastridge in
the campus newspaper that Pitt was
the team to beat in the meet.

But the Aquettes didn't exactly
live up to the expectations
Eastridge had of them, finishing
second to ‘the host Nittany Lion
squad, but they more than fulfilled

the standards head coach Virginia
Grindle set for her young perform-
ers going into the statewide meet.

‘ ‘I was very pleased with the way
the girls performed,” Grindle said
after the meet. “Marilyn
Eastridge’s comment did give us
extra incentive to win, but we're a
young team and we're sure to win
our share of meets in the future. The
potential is there.”

Grindle could very well be right.
Only one senior, Debbie Speck, will
be lost from this year’s team. Al-
though Speck, who missed copping
the solo competition at Penn State
by one point, will be missed, 13 girls
return next season-12 of whom

minutes (most gymnastics meets
last little more than two hours),
when the big teams come up they
get the higher scores and the small
teams get the lower scores,”

Is college Football A
Big Business at Pitt?

By JIM LEWIS
“In a letter to the editor published in the March 18 issue of the Pitt

News, a member of the Panther football team referred to college football

as ‘ ‘big business. ’ ’

“In any business (college football is a big business), ” the letter read,
‘ ‘you have to sell your product to the public and the public must buy it in

order for you to maintain business.’

College football as a business? The mere thought conjures up some

neat analogies.

For example, what if the author of the letter meant that college
football is run like a steel mill? In the steel industry, a group of people

work together to produce a product.

The same holds true for the Pitt

Panthers—they work together to produce a product, according to the
author, in order to ‘ ‘maintain business. ” A steel worker gets paid for his

chores. A Pitt Panther...?

Or what if the author meant that college football is run like a pro sport
franchise? There, an owner of such a franchise (which is aibig business)
pays players a salary to perform with his team. If that player performs
.up to the potential the owner. expects, the player can be assured of a job
for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, the owner can be assured of
“maintaining business, ” or making money on gate receipts. The owner
or person in charge would be making money and the player would be
getting payed for performing for a certain team. While here at Pitt...1?

Team Supports Bullman

By PATTY TASCARELLA

(This is the eeeondlnaeerles of articles on the ﬁring
of Pat Wallace, coach of the Pitt women’s basketball
team.)

Former Pantherette basketball coach Pat Wallace's
one-year contract was not renewed by Women's
Athletic Director Sandy Bullman because of Wallace's
poor personal relationship with her team. For the
most part, the Pantherettes feel the charge is
justified. .

Thirteen members of the team met Monday night
and issued the following statement: “We didn't feel
like we could talk truthfully with her because there
was no trust; she did not back up anything she said
previously. ’ ’

In the beginning of the year, Wallace had said the
team would use mass substitutive defense, this was
never carried out, according to the Pantherettes.
Wallace relied on the full court press, even when it
proved unsuccessful.

“She kept using it and the other teams would keep
scoring, scoring, scoring,” said one Pantherette.

“Everybody liked coach Wallace at the beginning Sr
the season, ” said center Wanda Randolph. “Maybe it
was the pressure, but she changed as the season went
on. I noticed that a lot of times; she had a tendency to
yell constantly. If a coach is good, she doesn't have to
yell to get her point across. It had an effect on the
team—the girls were afraid to play.”

‘I High on the Pantherettes’ list of complaints was the
claim that Wallace stubbornly refused to change game
plans or listen to the players’ opinions and that she
consistently played favorites among the athletes.

‘Wallace had been charged with favoritism towards

forward  Senkowski (whom-_ she coached,-fat --

Lancaster Catholic High School) since she first took
over the team. Wallace said the charges were
unfounded, that Senkowski, as the team’s second
leading scorer, had proven herself this season.
Senkowski’s shooting percentage was remarkably
low, however. According to her teammates, Wallace
gave Senkowski little discipline on the courts.

“There was definitely favoritism,” said one
Pantherette. ‘ ‘Seeing the way she (Senkowski) played
and yet remained in the game. (At the I‘eg.i0n3lS)'
MiMi did like she always does—she just ﬁred and
ﬁred and didn't hit a thing.” a

“During the regionals, I asked if they (her
teammates) could pass me the ball and she (Wallace)
just sat there with her legs crossed,” Randolph
related. “What kind of coach is she?”

The team was informed of the coaching change
during a morning practice session at Fitzgerald Field
House when Wallace and assistant coach Jean
Balthaser left, telling the squad to continue to run
plays. Scheduling and Program Coordinator Carol
Sprague told the team to report upstairs—-where they
met with Bullman and Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski—and were told the coaches’ contracts

' would not be renewed.

“The one-year contract should be changed,”
forward Barb Welsh said. “It takes at least two years
with one coach to see if a team works. The
administration is too closed-minded because of
Bullman’s previous basketball coaching experience
and her trying to be too involved.”

“I think she (Bullman) is very broadminded in that
she could have closed her door and said, ‘They're
winning, let them go,’ ” forward Kim Raymond

claimed. “But she saw unhappiness and did

ulum is wrong——Pitt students, like

others across the country, pay tuition to a university which puts money
into individual departments to keep a level of excellence and perhaps
improve the quality of that department. But very few students, if any,
are paid for attending a school, are given scholarships, are given special

services. But Pitt Panthers...?

honors in four separate events.

Freshman Marie Rocktashel from
Reading and Wendy Beisel, a
sophomore from Yardley, placed
third in the duct competition while
Mary Ellen DeMay, Sue Wheeler
and senior Speck teamed to win
ﬁrst-place honors in the trio routine.

In team competition, two Pitt
representatives ﬁnished among the
top five in the 10-squad meet.
Speck, DeMay, Pam Kelchner,
Rocktashel, Wheeler and Beisel led
their team to ﬁrst place while the
other Pitt squad consisting of Donna
Ahlum, Joy Kovacic, Micki Landy,
Karen Tolen, Karen Wahl and

Angela Vavithef ﬁnished ﬁfth.

The sky does indeed appear to be
the limit for the Aquettes within the
next several years.

“The way our freshmen have
improved is unbelievable,” Grindle
pointed out. “Synchronized
swimming hasn’t really caught on in

r the high schools the way speed

swimming has, so these girls
coming into synchro competition
are relatively new to the sport.

“That’s why I’m so pleased with
our freshmen and sophomores,”
she continued. “Marie (Rock-
tashel) has really done a nice job for
us. Donna (Ahlum) has really
improved as far as skill levels are
concerned. The same goes for

Karen Wahl and Wendy Beisel. For
being so young, they've all fit in
well within the team concept we
stress here at Pitt.”

Putting ihat potential into full use
is another story. The Association
for Intercollegiate Athletics, the
women’s equivalent to the NCAA,
will officially recognize synchroni-
zed swimming as a sport next year.
Pitt’s' athletic department, how-
ever, has stated that it will not grant

varsity status to synchronized
swimming here. As a result, the
only way the Aquettes will be able to
compete in future meets will be by
invitation only. Problems lie ahead
for the squad, however, as lack of
funds could very well squash the
entire program next year.

Such a bleak prospect obviously
hasn’t deterred this year’s squad
from giving their best performance
at Penn State.
