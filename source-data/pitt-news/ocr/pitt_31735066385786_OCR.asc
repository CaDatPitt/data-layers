Census attempt
angers homeless

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

Howard Brown feels that politicians will use the
census to cut aid to the homeless.

Advocates for the rights of homeless people gathered on a
street corner Tuesday night to protest the government’s census

They claimed that the census will most likely be too low and
will result in a cut of federal spending for the homeless.

The count will be inaccurate because “they’re going to the
shelters too early. T.hey’re in there at 6 [p.m.l when at 11 [pm]
more people will come in,” said Howard Brown, private
advocate for affordable housing and a former homeless person.

“How are they going to count the people under the bridges?
How the hell are they going to find all of the homeless people?
We want them to end this bogus count they’re doing tonight,"

The census is considered the most ambitious effort by the

Gree/e Wee/e opening

ceremonies tomg/at

By Karen D. Speece
Staff Writer

After a year of preparation,
Greek Week will commence
tomorrow with opening
ceremonies in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom.

Since 1952, fraternities and
sororities at the University of
Pittsburgh have sought to become
unified through their annual
Greek Week events.

According to Jerry O’Rourke
and Suzanne Meyer, event co-
chairpersons, “[Greek Week]
culminates five months of
preparation and hard work by
our [Chairpersons]. They have
given their time and talents
unselﬁshly for this much-awaited
event”

 This year, the Greeks hope to

raise $100,000 for St. Francis
Hospital’s “Courage to Come
Back” campaign through canning
for money and the dance
marathon.

The sponsors for this year’s
Greek Week events are Roy
Rogers Restaurant, Central Blood
Bank, Stroh’s Brewery — and
Cameron Coca—Cola. According
to Ben Luff, these sponsors
provide T-shirts, food, beverages
and various prizes and trophies.

The dance marathon, which in
the past has been exclusively a
Greek event, has been opened to
all Pitt students who pay the
minimum $55 donation fee. The
marathon starts on Friday at 6
p.m. and continues until 6 p.m.
on Saturday.

Athletes '

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

With all the criticism that the
press has given to low student
athletic-admissions standards,
athletic director Ed Bozik thinks
that people have forgotten about
the student athletes who excel in
their studies.

“We tend to lose sight of the
fact some student athletes do

' very well. In fact, the No. 1

graduate last year was a football
player,” Bozik said. ‘‘I started the
athletic director"s honors list in
1982, and since then, we have
averaged 20 to 25 percent of the
athletes who are making the 3.0
{grade point average] required

      
  

or better.”

Bozik was part of a four-
member panel speaking at
yesterday’s University Senate
meeting. College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe,
Associate Provostjack Daniel and
College of General Studies Dean

john Bolvin were the other
panelists. .
The discussion, “Scholarly

Pursuits and Athletics at the
University of Pittsburgh” included
short presentations by each
panelist with a question—and—
answer period immediately
following.

Briscoe said that the university’s
academic standards should not
be compromised for student

athletes.

“It is important that we look at
this problem in a national context.
There is nothing particularly new
about any of the issues that have
become publicly controversial.
This is an issue that people
everywhere are thinking about
and talking about,” Briscoe said.

According to a report that
Briscoe submitted, student
athletes at Pitt currently have an
average SAT score of 850, with
21 percent of them having
graduated in the bottom fifth of
their high—school class. The
average freshman at Pitt in CA8
has an SAT score of 1,020, with

Pitt Young Republican Kevin D ougherty (left) displays support for the vice president.

Quayle addresses city republicans

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Though they swore to come
out in droves to support Vice
President Dan Quayle during his
Pittsburgh visit, less than ten
College Republicans showed up
to greet him outside the Westin
William Penn hotel last night.

Quayle addressed a Republican
fund raising dinner at the hotel
that cost supporters $150 a plate.
The College Republicans,
representing Pitt, Carlow College
and Carnegie Mellon University
said that the reason for the small
numbers outside was because
many of their members were
inside the hotel listening to Quayle
speak.

“Pm sure all of us would like to
be in the hotel eating a good meal
and meeting the vice president,”
Kevin Dougherty said. “But
someone has to be out here.”

~When asked where the CMU
club was, Cindi Tarshis and Corn
Metz answered “We are the club.”

“Our president had a lab today.
We’re skipping class to be here,”
Metz added.

Though the vice president was
only visible to the people outside
the hotel for a few seconds, the
College Republicans had to listen
to 40 demonstrators across the
street taunting them and shouting
slogans about Quayle.

“This is wrong,” Dougherty said,
unravelling an American ﬂag.
“We’ve got to make sure they

don’t get the coverage.”

The demonstrators held up
signs and chanted slogans like
“We are union” and “He’s so
dumb.” When Dougherty began
to wave his flag, someone yelled,
“Need a match? What country are
you for?”

“The opposition is always so
nasty,” Dougherty said to his
colleagues. “That’s because they
know they’re wrong.”

The demonstrators on the other
corner represented an all-star
team of Pittsburgh liberal politics,
including union members,
National Organization for Women
representatives and Central
American activists. Three of the
city’s most colorful activists, Vince

For The Pitt News

Deaf Awareness Day festivities
held in the William Pitt Union
Wednesday afternoon had all the
trappings of a celebration. Along
with balloons and laughter, music
filled the air, music that was not
heard by the deaf people
attending — but was seen.

Beautiful Hands and Sign
Waves, two sign language
performance groups, conducted
many performances throughout
the day doing so_ng interpretations
in American Sign Language. The
performances to well known
tunes combined dancing, props
and costumes to not only interpret
the songs but to act them out as
well.

Beautiful Hands was started
in 1980 by Karen Walkney, who

is deaf and a teacher of sign
language at Pitt. She is also the
faculty advisor for Sign
Connection, a deaf awareness
club at Pitt that sponsored the
event

Celebrities in the deaf
community such as Miss Deaf
Pennsylvania and John Maucere,
who posed for Playgirl magazine
as the “sexiest deaf guy in the
nation,” drew a lot of attention to
the event. Physical attractiveness
is something that the deaf
appreciate as much as the hearing
said Walkney.

Similarities between the deaf

and hearing were drawn upon as
part of an effort to, “bridge the
gap between the hearing and the
deaf so that the hearing
population can be more
knowledgeable about what’s

going on in the deaf community,”
Walkney said.

One major concern in the
deaf community right now is
getting a Federal bill for the
disabled passed into a law. For
deaf people, this would mean
closed captioning on all TV
programs. Also, it would provide
a phone relay service so that deaf
people would be able to
communicate on the telephone.
just these two improvements
would open up a new world of
communication that the hearing
community takes for granted.

Heather Cameron, a member
of Sign Connection who helped
organize Deaf Awareness Day,
said, “The only thing that deaf
people can’t do is hear, and it’s
really important that the hearing
world understands that.”

Quayle

Eirene, Jeanne Clark and Student
Action Union founder jay Katz,
were among the protestors. ’

Eirene, a longtime opponent of
nuclear weapons, said that he
was representing the Duncan and

homeless people. He added that

not enough money was going to
help the homeless.

‘‘I think that the whole thing
with the census going on shows
that the homeless don’t count,”
he said. “We are outraged; we are
here to speak for our homeless
brothers and sisters.”

she was there because “it is
outrageous to pay $150 to talk to

to speak Latin to go to Latin
America.”

“According to the NCAA,
athletes spend less time in class,
less time preparing for class and
less time relaxing with friends. In
season, football and basketball
players devote more time to their
sports than to classes and studying
combined," Briscoe said. “We see
these phenomena here, which is
why our committee has been
formed, because we are very
concerned about the survival of

Greeks

our students.”

The four panelists who make
up the committee are responsible
for reviewing admission
candidates who do not meet the
recently adopted requirements
for student-athlete admission. An
athlete is required to have an SAT
score of 750, a grade-point
average of 2.3 and a rank in the
top three-ﬁfths of his or her
graduating class. The committee
studies the candidate's academic
history to determine whether or

not he or she has a chance to
succeed academically.

“The primary reason we are
here is to educate the young
people [who] come to this
university. We also hope to win.
Our objective is to have the best
possible athletic program that we
can have. We are totally
committed to the efforts that have
been made in the last year to
review more carefully the
admissions standards for our
athletes,” Bozik said.

government to count homeless people yet. In Pittsburgh, 107
enumerators out of 1,500 nation wide took part.

From 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., they waited in 19 shelters around the city
and then from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. the enumerators patrolled 63 street
sites and 160 abandoned buildings.

"There are families, kids, veterans and all kinds of people out here.
How in the heck in one night are they going to come up with a count
of all the homeless people?” said Brown.

“Nobody knows what it’s like to sleep out here, to sleep on concrete
and wake up with aches and pains in my legs. it’s like living in hell,
brother. It’s a sad world. You wake up shivering; you don’t know if
you have pneumonia. You don’t know what you have,” said
“Raindance,” who has been homeless for 21 years.

Brown pulled on his friend Raindance’s dirty parka and said, “This
is his home; could you imagine living in this everyday?”

Passmgtbe gay rights bill

In a free society like America, people are supposedly
able to express themselves freely and openly without the
constraints of politicians or religious zealots hampering
these rights.

Pittsburgh's City Council has taken a step toward‘

ensuring these rights for everyone with the ratification of
the . gay-rights amendment Tuesday. The passage of the
bill mandates that it will be illegal to discriminate against
people because of their sexual orientation.

The bill extends to employment, public accommoda-
tions and housing, and if enforced may take great strides
against the persecution of those deemed “different”
because of their sexual preference. '

The vote was shuttled through 6-2 with one abstention
by Duane Darkins. Although the vote righted the 4-4
rejection of the same bill 17 months ago, it was disheart-

ening to see that two council members — President Jack I

Wagner and Bernard Regan ——- voted against the propo-
sition. Both claimed that there was insufficient evidence
to back up claims of gay discrimination.

Even if there was never one such case in Allegheny
County, which is unlikely, the bill would safeguard the
rights of those who might be discriminated against. And
Darkins’ claim that he was unfamiliar with the events
surrounding the bill is not only a poor excuse but is
unforgivable. It is Darkins’ job to be familiar with those

events that will affect the city and those bills which he will _

have to vote on.

The six members who pushed the bill through council
should not be applauded, however. They have merely
righted awrong done to a part of the community a year
and a half ago. They have done their jobs.

Meanwhile, back in the USSR...

The Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics is the largest country
on earth with an area of 8,600,383
square miles and a population of
267,190,000. Taken together, the
Russian, Ukrainian and Byelo-
nissian (or White Russian) Soviet
Federated Socialist Republics’ are
larger than any country on earth,
with an area of 6,906,001 square
miles and a population of
200,415,000. They contain the
majority of national resources in
the Soviet Union and are the
most inﬂuential republics of the
union. Taken alone, Russia itself
is larger than any country on
earth, with the majority of Soviet
natural resources and a sizable

_ population.

These three republics are per-
fectly capable of standing on their
own as one independent coun-
In fact, both Morton Kon-
dracke (columnist for the New
Republic) and George Will (col-
umnist for Newsweek) have stated,
in no uncertain terms, that Russia
should secede from the Soviet
Union.

Nationalism is ﬂourishing in
the non-Russian republics of the
Soviet Union, which for years
have been oppressed by both
czarist Russia and communist
Russia. Centuries of Russian
imperialism are on the brink of
destruction. It has happened in
Eastern Europe and it appears to
be striking at the heart of the
Kremlin. The attempts to obliter-
ate class, nationalism, ethnicity,
religion and individualism have
completely failed in the U.S.S.R.

The chances of the Ukraine
and Byelorussia leaving the So-
viet Union are virtually nonexist-
ent. For one thing, they all share
a somewhat common history and
culture. While the Ukraine is
nationalistically different from
Russia, it has had only a very
small history of independence. It
is here that the ancient country of
Kiev -—Russ, the predecessor to
Russia, began. Also, it is too
important economically to Rus-
sia. And Byelorussia has always

been pro-Russian with no history
of independence.

. Why doesn't the Soviet Union
allow its other republics to leave
the union? Aren’t they more
trouble than they are worth? The
rest of the Soviet Union is so

    

Grecich

diverse and has been incorpo-
rated forcibly under the czars and
Communists. The Soviet Union
should allow Moldavia to merge
with Romania, from which it was
taken. It should also allow the
Baltic republics to leave the un-
ion; they were unconditionally
incorporated into the union by
force. ‘This desire for independ-
ence was demonstrated in the
Baltics in an historic event on
Sunday, March 11, 1990.

The first democratically elected
legislature in Lithuania in over 50
years voted to secede from the
Soviet Union. While this may not
be the wisest economic move on
Lithuania’s part, it is a move that
means something more. It sym-
bolizes the right of a republic to
leave the autocratic rule of the
U.S.S.R., of which it has been a

forced member for 50 years. It is

a rule that has made it economi-
cally dependent and weak.

The president of the Soviet
Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, set
an ultimatum for Lithuania to
renounce its actions by last
Monday, or else. Or else what’ It
may face economic sanctions,
which would cripple it and

blacken the reputation of Gor-
bachev and the Soviet Union,
forcing the West to help and
support Lithuania. 'It may, in
everyone‘s worst nightmare, face
military force. Unless Lithuania is
let go, East-West tensions are
bound to increase, and Gor-
bachev’s popularity would plum-
met.

The fear of force is real, for
there are currently an estimated
one million Soviet troops in Lithu-
ania (none of which are Lithuani-
ans), a country whose popula-
tion is ten-percent Russian. Gor-
bachev has already gone so far as
too restrict communication be-
tween Lithuanian and the rest of
the world, including the Soviet
Union. He has also ordered more
troops to move closer to Lithu-
ania. This is all happening at a
time when elections have just
been held in the other two other
Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia,
in which there is a high probabil-
ity that independence will be
declared in the near future as
well. 1

Is it really worth it for the Soviet
Union to keep the union intact?
No. It should seek to incorporate
a new state of Russia and Byelo-
russia with limited autonomy to
the Ukraine, similar to Canada’s
policy with Quebec. If the other
republics of the Soviet Union
decide to leave the union, they
should be let go. They are, after
all, granted this right by the Soviet
Constitution.

The Soviet Union will not be
“losing out” in this but will in-
stead be gaining, for it will be
consolidating its efforts at eco-
nomic, military and social growth
and restructuring. In doing so,
economic ties should not be be
broken, but rather will be main-
tained between the U.S.S.R. and
the new states. To have eco-
nomic ties does not require po-
litical and military domination.

Q‘.

THE pm NEWS, Thursday, March 22, 1990

The media's first amendment pariahs

Like a bad rash that reap-
pears when you least expect
it, so reappears the argument
about gayrights.

Both locally and nation-
ally, the issues of gay rights,
gay-bashing and straight rights
have been peeping out of
ground —— the first bugaboos
of spring.

During the past two
months, two incidents have
once again propelled the “gay”
question onto front-page
news: the ACT-UP raid on St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New
York City and the temporary
dismissal of Andy Rooney
from 60 Minutes. _

Cardinal John O’Connor of
New York is a Roman Catholic
leader the way he is supposed
to be —- doctrinal, intelligent,
savvy. O’Connor, in accor-
dance with his religion, is
against homosexual behavior,
notorientation. In fact, O’Con-
nor preaches against gay-
bashing, as does Catholicism
as a whole. If only gays were
as courteous as the cardinal.
Recently, militant gay
stormtroopers calling them-
selves ACT -UP invaded St.
Patrick's Cathedral during Mass
and harassed both parishion-
ers and priests. Worse yet, one

gay, under the guise of taking
Holy Communion, desecrated
the Eucharist by spitting it
onto the floor. For Roman
Catholics, who View the Eu-
charist as the body of Christ,
this is extreme sacrilege.

The second national inci-
dent was the temporary dis-
missal of Andy Rooney, the

curmudgeon of 60 Minutes.

On TV, Rooney listed “homo-
sexual unions” as one of the
ways we are killing ourselves.
He was no doubt referring to
promiscuous homosexual
behavior, which still exists
even in the wake of AIDS.
Because of the uproar from
the homosexual “community, "
Rooney was forced off the air
for three weeks.

Pittsburgh has been the
center of a couple of gay-
rights ﬁrestorms itself. At Pitt,
there is the question of gay
discrimination in the ROTC;
On Grant Street, the City
Council is about to pass a gay-
rights bill at any time. The
latter has been an extremely

suspicious problem. Certain

City Council members tried to
push the bill through without
benefit of a hearing. T79ePit1s-
burgh Press quoted Coun-
cilwoman Michelle Madoff as

saying, “We went through it
all before. Enough is enough.”
Madoff, it seems, didn’t think
the straights should get free
time to voice their opposition.
This brings .up the question of
straight rights.

According to the actions
of the vocal homosexual
community, it would appear
that straights are not included
in the “freedom of speech"
amendment. Cardinal O’Con-
nor is not allowed to voice
doctrine; Rooney, who is paid
for his opinions, is not al-
lowed to give them, and Pitts-
burgh is practically denied a
hearing on a gay- rights bill.

Indeed, my last column
was objected to by at least one
reader. Though the column
was about a proposed West
Virginia bill, a, university stu-
dent wrote in, outraged about
a simile I had used (he called
it a metaphor), which he felt
showed my insensitivity to-
wards the gay “community.”
This student suggested that I
be tossed from The Pitt News
until I compose a “proper and
sincere apology.” Well, he's
not going to get one.

What strikes me as pecu-
liar about gays is their method
of attack on anti—homosexu-

als. Their first action is to
label these people as
“homophobes. ” Not only are
they being hypocritical with
their- objection to the
straights’ name-calling, but
also, are straights supposed
to take being called homo-
phobic as derogatory? Sec-
ond, many gays seem to
have a penchant for label-
ing anti-gays as being se-
cretly homosexual them-
selves. This seems more of
a fantasy than reality. Using
their own logic, I could
conclude that gays who are
constantly straight—bashing
are secretly normal. This, I
freely admit, is my fantasy.
It is guaranteed that
when homosexuals and

other sensitive types read

this column, they will again
be outraged, shocked and
just genuinely, appalled.
Perhaps they will try to
pressure The Pitt News into
firing me. Perhaps they will
succeed. But by joining the
other freedom—of-speech
martyrs like Rooney and
O’Connor, I'll be in good
company.

Racism must be stopped at its source 

I had a really disturbing experience
while waiting for Pittsburgh’s speedy public
transportation several days ago that I think
a lot of people could benefit from.

I was having a light, pleasant conversa-
tion with a cute little old lady who was
waiting at the same bus stop with me. As
we were chatting about the nice weather,
a man approached us and proceeded to
strike up a conversation about how ter-
rible his day at work was.

I personally have no objections to a man
letting off a little steam after having a bad
day, and I figured that he just didn’t have
anyone else to lay this burden on but two
strangers at a bus stop. I made under-
standing faces and pretended to sympa-
thize with him, while the older woman
seemed to genuinely care that he had had
such a stressful day. V

However, the next comment he made
not only caught me by complete surprise,
but I felt like I couldn’t have possibly
heard him correctly. It seems that his
terrible day started off with, and I quote,
an attack by “two niggers.”

But this man wasn't satisfied with just an
offhand racial slur; he had to reiterate his
point by repeating that ugly word and
following it with even more disgusting
comments like, “The only good nigger is

a dead nigger.” ,

It wasn’t that I was so shocked to have
heard this word (or even that phrase),
since it’s not the first time I’ve heard it, and
it probably won’t be the last, but the
intense hatred that he displayed for an
entire race of people was frightening --

to say the least.

And for the first time, the point was
driven home to me that there are actually
people who live and work in this city —
and in this day and age— who feel exactly
the same way this man feels. It made me

Missie Wﬂson

sick. And what was even worse was the

fact that this cute older woman was in total
agreement. , '
C You may be wondering what I was
doing while all this was going on, and to
tell you the truth, I was so surprised that
I didn’t know what to do. My mind was
busy thinking that I should do something,
that I should tell this man how much he
was offending me. But I did nothing, and
I am ashamed of that. A

I am ashamed because I allowed this
man to say things that I found really
sickening, andl didn’t do anything to stop
him. I am ashamed because I didn’t stand
up against such blatant racism, when I
pride myself on “not being prejudiced.”
But mostly, I am ashamed because I felt

that I was only one person, and that I 1

couldn’t really do anything that would put
an end to situations like this.

And I guess that the reason that I felt it
was so important to share this story with
as many people as possible is because
chances are good that someday, in one

way or another, you will come into con-
tact with someone who is a total bigot.
And I don’t want anyone else to do what
I did — nothing.

I could have handled the situation really
tactfully and just told the man that I found
his statements totally offensive, and that I
would appreciate it if he did not make
such comments in my presence. I’m sure
that he would not immediately see the
error of his ways and devote the rest of his
life to ending racism, but just maybe it
would have made him stop and think
about exactly what he said that had come
across so badly.

The other alternative would have been
to start a screaming match with him,
insulting him in the way that he had
insulted an entire race of people. How-
ever, that would have gotten nowhere and
would have just put me onto his level —
which is one that I definitely don’t want to
be on.

But that doesn’t mean that we should do
nothing. It really bothers me that I didn’t
take the opportunity to strike out, even if
only in such a small way, against a prob-
lem that needs a lot more attention than it
gets. And I, for one, have sworn that I will
not wait for another situation like that one
to come up before I stand up against
racism. But for everybody out there who
is reading this, if such a thing should
happen to you, speak up, it’s the very least
you can do.

states, pri-

vate sex- -

ual behavior between consenting adults
can be controlled by the state authorities.
These states have sodomy laws that regu-
late non—procreative sex. In other words,
you can go to jail orbe fined for oral sex,
anal sex and even masturbation. You
don’t have to be a gay man or a lesbian
woman to be charged with sodomy. James
Moseley spent 17 months of his five-year
sentence in jail before the American Civil
Liberties Union secured his release. Don’t
be alarmed; Pennsylvania repealed its
sodomy law 10 years ago. ,

Now back to James Moseley. Moseley
and his wife were going through a di-
vorce. She used private sexual informa-
tion to discredit Mr. Moseley. On the
stand, Moseley admitted that he had oral
sex with his wife, not thinking that he was
violating state law or incriminating him-
self. Judge Ison felt that he hadno choice
but to uphold G~eorgia’s 156—year-old
sodomy statute. James went to jail on May
12, 1988; Mrs. Moseley received custody
of their children. Seventeen months later,
James Moseley was released, thanks to
the ACLU.

Some people say that this case is unbe-
lievable, but it shouldn’t be a surprise.
Many people are shocked to read about
James Moseley because he is a heterosex-
ual man. In the past, sodomy laws were
used only to harass, to intimidate and to
discriminate against lesbian women and
gay men.

On June 30, 1986, the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled 5-4 that the Constitution does
not protect adult consensual sexual be-
havior even in the privacy of the adults’
own homes. Argued by the ACLU, the
case of Bowers vs. Hardwicle involved
Michael Hardwick, a gay man. A police
officer serving an unrelated warrant found
Hardwick and Hardwick’s boyfriend in
bed together. Hardwick was arrested and
only fined $300. However, he challenged
the Georgia law as an unconstitutional
invasion of his right to privacy. Unfortu-
nately, the medieval Supreme Court ruled
against Hardwick and all lesbian women
and gay men. The Supreme Court ruled
against all heterosexual people that just
don’t have sex in the missionary manner.
The Supreme Court ruled against all people
that don’t have sex just to beget children.

All lesbian women and gay men in
Georgia, as well as James Moseley and
every heterosexual person, are denied
their rights to privacy, sexual expression
and self-determination. Although sodomy
laws are rarely enforced, they send a
chilling message throughout our country.
Ask yourself, “Are you free?”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Lying in bed last night, trying to fall asleep by
counting sit-ups, it suddenly dawned on me that
Dan Marino wants to be traded.

Not just dan marino, or even Dan Marino, but the
real-life DAN MARINO requests a trade to another
NFL franchise. Hey, one of the greatest quarterbacks
the National Football League has ever employed,
with or without a collective-bargaining agreement,

wants out from under the aging
iron fist of one Don Shula, out of
a Miami Dolphins uniform, out
from his seven-year Miami vice.\

The teams that DAN MARINO
would like to play for include
the Oakland Raiders, Chicago

. Bears and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The teams that desperately need
V DAN MARINO playing for them,

with the present incumbent in
parentheses are the Oakland
Raiders (Steve Beuerlein),
Chicago Bears (Mike T omczak)
and Kansas City Chiefs (Steve
\DeBerg)., ‘

The Steelers claim that they
are satisfied with Bubby “Walter”

Brister at the quarterback position but have secretly
informed the Dolphins that they would strongly
consider giving up a ninth-round draft pick and the
rights to Mark Stock in order toacquire him.
Now, comparing DAN MARINO to Brister is like
comparing Don Johnson to Don Johnstown — who

is Don Johnstown, right?

DAN MARINO could strip Brister from his job
faster than it would take the Miami locals to strip an »
alarmless Porsche 944 on Biscayne Boulevard.
Certainly the Steeler people are aware of this. But in
A terms of bottom-line finance and team continuity,

A Pittsburgh will surely pass on this once-in-a—lifetime
opportunity. Which is, you know, fine. What's the
saying —-— whatever sinks your ship?

PAGE 8

trade talk is that the Philadelphia Eagles, led by
team owner and Miami businessman Norman

Braman, are unhappy with the play (and possibly

 

  Thomas

the contract) of starter Randall Cunningham and
would certainly love to have DAN MARINO under
center for them, even as early as the 1990 season.

At this time, however, Philly officials aren't
commenting on the rumor. Which, in the NFL

anymore, is the equivalent of the
full-blown truth, give or take a
few minor details that usually
turn out being the player to be
named later.

What do you think it would take
to acquire a player of DAN
MARINO’s status? A first-round
pick? Two first—round picks? One
thousand, four hundred players-
to—be-named-later? Eric
Dickerson? The Dallas Cowboys?

It’s difficult to judge. DAN
MARINO, 29, is statistically
supposed to be in the prime of
his career, although he seems to
have eaten up his prime years
during the miraculous 1984 and

’85 seasons. He has at least another five years left
in him before that hair-trigger arm starts to wear
out. He has never suffered any serious injuries.
His release is still as quick as ever.

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

When sports fans in western
Pennsylvania think of the
Aliquippa area, football
immediately comes to mind.

They envision Tony Dorsett of
Hopewell, Mike Ditka of
Aliquippa and Joe Namath of
Beaver Falls.

What Aliquippa hasn't been
known for is swimming. But Mike
and Joe Kozlina’s performances
at Pitt might helpchange that.

“We played other sports up
until junior high, but then in high
school [at Hopewell] we
concentrated on swimming,” said
Mike.

Mike, a 5-foot-10-inch senior
and psychology major, has put
together an impressive career after
transferring from Texas A&M
following his freshman year.

He was named the outstanding
swimmer of the Big East
Championships for the second
consecutive year. His name dots
the record board hanging at Trees
Pool. He holds Pitt records for
the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
backstroke events, in addition to
being on four record-setting relay
teams.

Raiders’ situation makes Marino ripe for picking

In 1988, he finished in eighth
place in the Olympic trials for the
100 backstroke, an event in which
the top two finishers went on to
the Olympics.

Joe, a 6—fo,ot—3-inch sophomore
and liberal—studies major working
toward a career in hotel
management, is completing his
first year of collegiate swimming
after sitting out his freshman year
for not meeting the academic
requirements of Proposition 48.

Mike and Joe, the youngest of
seven children, both got into
swimming for the same reason:
their older siblings were all
swimmers and helped teach them
the sport when they each were
about seven.

Their focus on swimming is
even more unusual, considering
that Hopewell didn’t have a swim
team until Mike was a senior and
Joe was a freshman. To get
experience, Mike had to swim for
Chartiers Valley High School,
which is about 25 minutes from
Hopewell.

They give much credit for their
success to their parents. “Our
motivation is our dad,” said Mike.
“If it wasn’t for him, Iwouldn’t be
sitting here right now.”

Their father, George, grew up
in a poor family and worked

every day after high school atJ&L

mother, Frances, right. after he
graduated from school.

‘‘I see people nowadays have
trouble with one kid, and we all

turned out well,” said Mike.

George Jr. is a physical therapist.
Georgeanna, who was their high-
school coach, is currently a
medical technologist. Diana is a

registered nurse. Sue has a ..

management position at BoRics
Hair Care, and Barbara, who
recently had a baby, is an assistant
swimming coach at West
Allegheny High School.

Mike originally started at Texas
A&M because he liked the
campus, the warm weather and
the coach. After one year, he left
A&M and came back home to Pitt
after having what he describes as
disagreements with the coach’s
style there.

When it came time for Joe to
pick a school, he decided he
wanted to stay close to home. He
also had been a member of the

high-school swimmers who
practice at Trees Pool. He knew

Pitt also played a big factor in
Joe’s decision and his adjustment
to college.

“He and [senior] Tim Adams
gave me a lot of advice,” saidjoe.
Mike told Joe to pace himself,
since the season is longer and
rougher than it is in high school.
There is also the lengthy practice
schedule which includes
swimming every afternoon, in
addition to several early mornings
per week.

Joe, who has predominantly
been swimming freestyle events
this season, is expected to have a

' more prominent role next season,

largely due to the graduation of
team captains Mike, Adams and
Bill Folger.

In an interview with the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, Pitt
swimming coach Dick Bradshaw
said, “By the time Joe’s through,
he could have the same kind of
record as Mike. He just needs
more experience.”

Mike, who is scheduled to
graduate in June, said he will
either attend graduate school at
Pitt or get a job and go back to
school later. If he stays in school,
he would like to be an assistant
coach. His decision to try out for
the Olympics again will depend
on if he has a strong showing at
this year’s NCAA Championships
and his possible participation in
the Pan—American Team over the
summer.

When Mike departs after this
season, many people may look
to Joe to follow in his brother’s
footsteps, but he’s not bothered
by the pressure.

The final swimming event of
the season will be the NCAA
Championships, for which Mike
was the only Panther swimmer to
qualify this season. Joe plans to
watch his brother compete and
hopes to swim there next year.

Marino

Continued from page 8’
became involved in the biggest
trade in NFL history and ended
up with ERIC DICKERSON in
their lap.

The Colts haven ’t been to the
playoffs for three years.

Where, then, would he fit
in, and who, other than
DONALD TRUMP, could afford
to fit him? ,

The logical choice would be
the Raiders, where DAN
MARINO would be provided
with a backfield including Bo

Jackson and Marcus Allen, and
wide receivers named Tim
Brown, Mervyn Fernandez and
Willie Gault. The offensive line
in Oakland is adequate and

the tutoring of head coach Art
' Shell.

Now, what kind of resources
do the Raiders have to acquire
a player with a price tag like
his?

Draft choices, naturally. With
the outstanding wealth . of
talent available in this year’s
junior—senior college draft,
Oakland’s 11th pick in the first
round is a nice perk, as would
be lower-round picks and

will continue to improve under ‘

future No. Is. Lots and lots of
draft choices would be
necessary.

Players, naturally. Defensive
linemen Howie Long and Scott
Davis could easily be involved
in the package, as could
cornerback Terry McDaniel.
Marcus Allen could be too,
but Shula would only accept

I him as a throw-in. Running

back Steve Smith could be
considered.

Jay Schroeder? Well, the only
quarterback who would be in
Miami would be Scott Secules,
an unproven fourth—year man
out of Virginia. The Dolphins
would need depth at that
position, so Schroeder could
fill the void for a couple years,
despite being basically a cold
body. ‘

Money, most naturally. With
that $660 million deal owner
Al Davis struck with the city of
Oakland, he’ll have plenty of
cash to throw around wherever
it may be needed. And don’t
forget, cash is what it's all
about

Watch — after all this, he’ll
probably end up in Seattle. Or
Miami.

UConn -——— Headed toward destiny?

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer
Connecticut Huskie John

Gwynn was lifted up to cut the
net off the rim at Madison Square
Garden to celebrate the Big East
tournament championship his

team had just won on March 11.

Gwynn was stunned by his
vantage point. His eyes bulged
and his jaw dropped as he looked
around him. He was not used to
such heights.

Gwynn’s feeling reflected his
team’s.

Connecticut was headed to the
NCAA tournament as a favorite
to reach the Final Four. The land
of UConn has never experienced
such achievements.

“This is the highest of the highs
we have had all year, ’_’ said Huskie
captain Tate George. A “We’ve
worked so hard and come so
far. ' :
Despite their 30-5 record going
into tonight’s third- round NCAA
tournament game, Connecticut
is not a well—known basketball
team. They rely on strict, team-
oriented play. They have no
superstars. Head coach Jim
Calhoun rotates 10 players,
keeping fresh legs on the court
to run a pressure defense, which
is the team’s trademark.

“We have played 10 people all
year,” said Calhoun. “Our greatest
aspect as a team is that we have
10 very good players.”

Connecticut won the Big East
Tournament by defeating
Georgetown and Syracuse back-
to-back. They impressed some of
the bigger names in the
conference.

“In all my years in the Big East,
Connecticut’s team has been the
most impressive to me,” said
Georgetown coach John
Thompson. “Their coach has done
one of the most exceptional jobs
I’ve seen in my last 18 years I’ve
been coaching. They play
together, but more importantly,
they play consistently together.
Their team chemistry is amazing.”

H The Huskies play a half-court

or full-court defense. If the
opponent breaks the press, they
ﬂuidly fall back into their zone or
man-to-man defense.

Calhoun has been successful
emphasizing defense in an
offense-minded game.

“We run on defense but walk
on offense,” he said.

“After they score, we don’t run

up the floor. We can dictate the I

tempo [of a game]. We like to
take our time on offense and play
tight on defense,” Calhoun added.

“They’re a great team. They
play great defense. They force

turnovers. You don’t see in the E

stats what they can do,” said
Seton Hall coach P. J. Carlesimo.
Calhoun’s defensive system
counts on every player fulfilling
his role.
“We play the five freshest guys

The public is welcome to come and enjoy
the fun. For any questions, call 624-1279

and keep the rotation going. We
do play and win a lot on emotion
and hard work,” said Calhoun.

UConn’s style is a simple game
of “keep away”. They force an
average of 21 .4 turnovers a game,
while only committing 14.7
themselves.

Syracuse point guard Stephen
Thompson was responsible for
breaking the Huskie press in the
Big, East championship game.

“They pressure the ball and get
all over the court. When you’re
playing a defense like that, - it
looks like there is so much room
on the court, and you can pass
the ball anywhere you want,” he
said.

“You have to be able to handle
their pressure,” said Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim. “And
somebody in the center is going

to give you trouble if you get:

through their pressure.”

Connecticut’s usual starter at
center is sophomore Rod Sellers.
However, he bruised ligaments
in his left knee two minutes into
the Georgetown game. Calhoun
did not sweat it for long. He used
sophomore Dan Cyrulik and
freshman Toraino Walkerthe rest
of the way. '

UConn is deep at every

.. position. They have a bench filled

with role players. Three freshmen
and three sophomores comprise
part of the team’s nucleus. Guard
Tate George is the only senior.

There are different opinions
about who Connecticut’s best
players are. Nadav Henefeld, a
freshman forward from Tamat—
Hasharon, Israel, is the team’s
leader in rebounds (5.9 a game),
three-point shooting (40 percent)
and steals (120). ~

George gets some sympathetic
support as the team’s best player.

b He is the experienced leader who

has struggled through three
mediocre seasons before this year.

Rod Sellers leads the team in
field-goal shooting (55 percent)
and is second in rebounds and
blocked shots.

But ask the coach who his best
player is.

“Chris Smith is our best
basketball player,” said Calhoun.
“I’ve said that the past two months.
He’s our best defensive player.”

Smith, a sophomore guard, is
the team’s leading scorer (almost
17 points a game) and was
awarded Big East Tournament
Most Valuable Player.

The winning season has
obviously made it an enjoyable
one for Calhoun. But Calhoun
has also been impressed with his
players’ maintaining a relaxed
attitude. 4

“They really enjoy each other.
They enjoy playing basketball.
That is one of the most refreshing
things about coaching this team.
Nine or 10 guys play together
and everybody fills a role.”

Connecticut has defeated
Boston University and California
to make it to the NCAA

tournament’s “Sweet 16.” Destiny
may make them more famous in
the next two weeks.

91¢’: '. I C \

 

By Tim Azinger

. Showcase Editor

You wouldn’t expect the
thrashy, punk’n’ro1l of Bullet
LaVolta to have anything in
common with the plodding Edsel.

It seems that in the 19505, poet
Marianne Moore was
commissioned by the Ford Motor
Company to create names for
their new models. Utopian Turtle,
the Intelligent Whale and, of
course, Bullet LaVolta, were just
a few of her more imaginative
monikers.

While Ford settled for the Edsel,
the Boston quintet liked Moore’s
idea and opted for Bullet LaVolta.

Bullet LaVolta received hype
after the release of their first EP in
1988. In early 1989, Bullet LaVolta
independently released The Gift,
which quickly sold 7,000 copies
and led to the band being signed
to RCA/Taang!

RCA reissued The Gw, with
little change except for the
addition of two extra tracks, “Dead
Wrong” and “Over the Shoulder.”

Bullet LaVolta capitalizes on
raunchy rhythms and plenty of
speed, and why shouldn’t they
utilize the awesome power
potential of the dual guitars of
Clay Tarver and Kenny Chambers?
Bassist Bill Whelan and drummer
Todd Phillips round out the

.. .». ..~. :2‘ '.':,'r.' 'a'r.!-.' '."

rm; prrr NEW” ' ' l‘S,l:I'hursdayl‘ , March 22, 1996"

rhythm section, and you can’t
forget the manic wailing of Yukki
Gipe.

Gipe, mild-mannered Kurt
Davis by day, came up with Yukki
for its obviously pleasant
connotations and Gipe from a
tombstone in the graveyard he
used to hang out in.

Compared with every band
from Motorhead and AC/DC to
Pussy Galore and The Cult, Bullet
LaVolta seems content to fall
somewhere dangerously in
between their personal favorites
AC/DC and the Stooges.

Gipe’s live performance
revitalizes images of Iggy Pop in
all his Stooges glory, and yet he
sees himself as less of a vocalist
and more of a front man whose
main goal is to communicate
emotions and energy. Coupled
with the fact that Gipe doesn’t
smoke (after a 14-year habit),
drink or eat meat, you get the
feeling that Yukki knows exactly
what he wants from life.

Bullet Lavo1ta’s live show is
more than entertaining. There’s
enough spastic energy emitting
from these long—haired rockers
to overload the most stable
circuits.

Soundgarden at the CM] Metal
Marathon at NYU back in October

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, March 22, 1990

to perform in Pittsburgh,

By Jessica Lowenadler
Staff Writer

Relentless satire, a sharp eye
and ready wit describes the the
Woody Allen of dance, Stuart
Pimsler. His company has been
well—received throughout the
United States since its debut in
1978 and will be presented by the
Pittsburgh Dance Council this
Friday and Saturday at the Eddy
Theatre for a Pittsburgh premiere.

More than 10 years ago, Pimsler
was determined to become a
lawyer but quickly changed his
direction after attending a dance
performance by the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theatre.

Pimsler says he formed Stuart
Pimsler Dance & Theater to
“express my interest and concern
about what is important in the
world.” Much of Pimsler’s work
combines comedy and theater,
often using autobiographical
material about growing up in a
Jewish family in Brooklyn.

With a style Pimsler refers to as
movement theater, the company
performs with visual and verbal
expression, using body
movement to create strong images
and speech whenever Pimsler
feels it’s necessary to
communicate an idea.

SPDT will be presenting a.

program of four works which
best reflect Pimsler’s humorous
and compassionate insight to
everyday life. joy, informally
subtitled “Portrait of an Artist as a

Young Jew,” by the
choreographer is a solo Pimsler
that choreographed for himself.
Pimsler reveals his soul and his
boxer shorts as he expresses
himself as someone concerned
with sex, fame, money and

disapproving parents. W

Swimming to Cecile is a
beautifully evocative work using
three dancers to illustrate the
power of presence and also the
lack of it. Two of the dancers
represent life, while the third
dancer represents spirituality. The
piece is a dedication to the
choreographer’s mother, who
died when Pimsler was fifteen.

T l7eMen from tbeBoy5 is a new
work by Pimsler, enhanced by
what the Cincinnati Inquirer
described as “a natural sense of
humor with superb cometic
timing.” Common Gardens is
choreographed by Suzanne
Costello, Pimsler’s wife and
associate artistic director for the
company. ’

SPDT is the final program in
the Pittsburgh Dance Council’s
1990 What’s next? series. The
series focuses on the freshest and
most unique choreography in

America, a reputation to which

Pimsler adheres.

Performances will be March 25
and 24 at 8:00 pm. at the Eddy
Theatre, Chatham College. For
more information or tickets,
contact the Pittsburgh Dance
Council at 555-0350.

Bad Inﬂuence: the next Lowe scandal?

By Rich Turgeon
Staff Writer

This mOvie’s poster alone was
a bad influence On my
expectations Of this Chris Hanson
(T be Bedroom Window) ﬁlm, not
to mention the latest endeavors
Of its stars, Rob Lowe and James
Spader (sex, lies and videotape).
I thought I was in for some sort of
cheap exploitation Of their
successes in their recent romantic
leading roles — Spader in sex
and Lowe in his Atlanta Teen
Night instructional tape.

These suspicions were partially
confirmed; there is a scene
involving videotaped sex and
numerous sex scenes and some
more sex, and even some lies,
but it’s very clear that underneath

an adept attempt at a satisfying
psychological thriller.

Spader plays Michael Boll, a
successful marketing analyst
railroaded into a “perfect”
marriage and a dreary, workaholic
life by his Own ambitions and
lack Of control. Yes, this sounds
stereotypical, and it is, but
Spader’s performance is so multi-
faceted that the extra dimension
he gives the character saves the
film from becoming the
“debauched gOOdy—twO—shOes”
picture it initially appears to be.
Lowe plays a mysterious drifter
named Alex who saves Michael
from a bar brawl. Although it’s
never clearly established where
Alex’s interests lie in befriending
Michael, he shows Mike a wild
time and gets him into all sorts Of

adultery, drugs and murder.
After a while, Mike decides he
doesn’t want to hang Out with
Alex, and the fun begins. Of
course, it’s much more fun when
you dOn’t ask yourself why the
hell any’ Of this nonsense is
happening. The fIlm’s eerie
suspense and tangibility is
primarily a result Of the fine
performances Of both actors rather
than its bullet-ridden script.
Lowe’s portrayal isn’t anything to
sing about, but it is refreshingly
surprising and fun to watch.
Although Bad Influence is easily
reminiscent Of such city/mOney/
drug flicks such as Bright Lights,
Big City; Less 779cm Zeroand even
Fatal Attraction, it manages to
evoke an identity Of its Own, as
does any film with such a slick,

Claire (Lisa Zane) plays aBad Inﬂuence.

W'z‘1mer's get something from reforming old musical ties

By Gene Daevid Cunningham
For The Pitt News

What do the following things
have in common: The Affordable
Floors, Fusebox, North By
Northwest and The
Waterhammers? Local groups?
Yes. Pop—oriented rock? Possibly.
John Young and Steve Morrison?
Deﬁnitely. At one time or another,
one or both have been in each of
these Pittsburgh bands. But what
do John and Steve have in
common beyond this?

The two have been writing
together for a number of years.
The strength of their collaborative

efforts is in their ability to
exchange roles. If the inspiration
hits them, they can write out a
song quickly, each alternately
writing a line or two of lyrics,
then perhaps a chord progression
or melody.

But one can also offer ideas to
the other’s almost ﬁnished song.
Either way, their collaborative
efforts still have a distinct sound
not found in any of their other
projects. “The songs I write with
John are a lot closer to my musical
personality,” explains Steve.

The new tape they’ve recorded
does have a personality of its
own: “depressing love songs,”

according to John. “We’re just a
couple of lovelorn sad sacks,”
adds Steve, “who’ve been
bounced through the mill a few
too many times.” Even the title,
taken from a collection of
Hemingway short stories, offers a
cynical view of love: Winner
Take Nothing. 0

Even though the tape has gotten
a good response locally at WPTS,
John and Steve promise their next
project will be happier. But at
present they’re not too worried
about recording a new tape;
they’re busy trying to release this
one. (The name of the band is
simply Steve Morrison & John

Young, not the rumored Boxer
Rebellion —— an innocent joke
about Steve and John leaving
Fusebox.)

They’re trying to spark some
interest in their new sound and
raise some money to release the
tape by playing live shows in the
area, beginning this Friday at the
Upstage in Oakland. And even
though the sound is a departure
from either Steve’s orJohn’s early
or current projects, they’re
conﬁdent that people are ready
for their acoustic sound —— “Rock
with no rhythm section,” as Steve
puts it —— citing acts like Michelle
Shocked and even Michael Penn

as examples.

The two are excited about
getting back to the stage together.
They’ve already performed on
open stages at Graffiti, and they
say they feel comfortable playing
their new material. “I just feel so
enthusiastic about the songs that
it’s very easy to perform them,”
John says.

Their future is not set in stone
as far as other projects, but as a
collaborative team, they plan to
work indefinitely. Perhaps one
day their songs will be in
mainstream listening, but for now
Steve and John are happy just to
write and play music.

Bad

Continued from page 7
film-noir look and a good cast.
These are the surface pleasures
of this moronic script by
Hollywood newcomer David
Koepp (Apartment Zero), and
underneath them, director
Hanson skillfully keeps his focus
on the tensions among the
characters rather than settling for
cheap thrills.

The movie is, at times, wildly
unpredictable (almost too
deliberately so), and its subtle
execution became instantly
intriguing. Badlnﬂuencesappeal
seems to be a result of its success
in creating and exploring both a
psychologically and physically
subterranean existence; its theme

of the underlying darkness in the
world and in ourselves is a
beautifully detailed product of
this environment.

The film has its share of
problems that can often be traced
to its flawed, amateurish script,
so I won’t bother going into its
gaping plot holes or describing
certain wretched snatches of
dialogue (that painfully, primarily
reside in the film’s climax).
Unfortunately, because of Bad
Inﬂuences serious lack of clarity,
it could easily be dismissed as a
confusing, weird mess. lfone can
tolerate this movie’s evident
disorganization, Bad Inﬂuence
will become an exciting and
suspenseful ride.
