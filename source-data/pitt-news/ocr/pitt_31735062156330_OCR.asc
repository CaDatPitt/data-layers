Religion-in-Life‘ Week at
Pitt came to a_ close last night

. with an elections dinner meet-

ing in p the
Church. . V
_ Oﬁicers for the conference
nextyear were selected.~ In
past years only!’ t'e‘m-porary
officers were named, but since
the conference may come in the

First ‘ Baptist

 fall semester next term, ﬁnal

leaders were appointed.

According to most persons

working with. the conference this.

year, the program was a success.

. Jerry. Froimson, publicity chair-

man, said that. the Monday con-
evocation was ﬁlled to “standing
room only,” and other activities
such as the ﬁreside chats and the
folk festival were well attended.

Joe Marasco, student chairman
for Religion-in-Life this year of-
fered his opinions on the success
‘of the program to the Pitt News
Wednesday.‘ Said Marasco:

“I feel that the purpose of a
Conference on
the theme ‘Brotherhood: Dreamior
Reality?’ is to provide a two—fold
experience, ﬁrst to promote un-
derstanding and secondly, through
this understanding, to promote
growth on the part of the indiv-
idual. In -some ‘cases, the ’week

‘ has fulfilled‘ this purpose com-_

plesely, in other cases, only part-
’ ly, and in still others, not at all.

.. »‘‘Even though various -problems" 4
did arise, I"feel that student ;re'-

 

_celle‘i‘ated

Class organization forlmenﬂ students» will probably be‘ in-

stituted by the Dean of Men’s Ofﬁce, this spring.’ 
According to Dean of Men Theodore Biddle, “a pro-

gram ofpclass oﬁicers could be a manner

of doing a lot of

things for the University through the-students.”

‘Dean Biddle said Wednesday’ -
consisting of students from, various

that a system of class organization
has worked in the past. It has
not been established recently be-
cause of the large classes and ac-
program necessary
after World War II. He added
“the faculty appreciates a need
for communication to- the stu-
dents?’ -
Would Elect Officers

According to the plan proposed
by the dean-, eaéh class,in each
undergraduate school would
elect four or ﬁve oﬁicers. Inthis

_manner, the class officers would
‘know whom‘ they are represent-

mg- .

Under Dean B‘1ddle’s plan,.stu-
dents wouldinota run for speciﬁc
positions, in class elections. In-
stead of running for president or
treasurer, they would merely. pe-
tition for election to class oiﬁce.
Oﬁices would then be assigned pn
the basis of number of votes cast
for an individual. r .
A This system, according to ‘Bid-
dle, will assure ;more good men
getting jobs. " '" .

Prevent Domination

In order to prevent particular

group from dominating the ‘elec-
tions, each student will only vote
for -two candidates on elections
day. The dean hopes to give’min-
orities some in class operation. '
‘Dean Biddle claimed that” one

DENINNO

Thaw Hall and the Old Mellon Building ‘on O’Hara St., were

announced Wednesday by Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, chancellor, at the

‘ annual Century Alumni ‘Club

banquet at the Hotel Schenley.

In an interview before the
banquet the Chancellor explained

. the delay in the building of _the

Student Union.

However his address mainly
concerned the new Engineering
building. .

Ground for the new $1,000,000.
structure will be broken some-
time this summer, according to the
Chancellor. ’ A «

Taken From Clapp Fund

I Dr. Fitzgerald told the guests
at 'the banquet that the million
dollars necessary for the construc-
tion of the -building was taken

. from a $3,500,000 fund from which

-will alsg be built a new science

' building to be named Clapp‘ Hall.
The proposed Student Union,

building still faces obstacTes,.
however. Dr. Fitzgerald explained
that the delay injits construction
is due to the fact that there is no

mg.

' He said -that, until _recently,
plans had been drawn up with
the New York Life Insurance
Company to ﬁnance the construc-
tion of’ the Union on’ the Cathed-
ral campus. ~ 7

. However, the Board» of Trustees
put ‘Fa damper on_ those plans
when they refused to" permit the
construction of any new build-
ings on ;the Cathedral lawn.

“Now an entire new set of
plans must ‘be made with the
company since the original
plans speciﬁcallystated that the

« Union would be built. {on the.
Cathedral campus,”_ said Dr.
Fitzgerald. '

In addressingwthe alumni, the
Chancellor exhibited sketches of

the new Engineering building to

ground yet available for the build— '

   
  
  
  
   
 
    
    
 
    
   
    
   
   
 
   
     
   
 

Three Story Wings
The wings forthe new building
will be ‘three stories‘”high dr,op- ‘
ping to one story on the ends.-
Its design will match the two
buildings neighboring it. Dr«.‘Fitz-
gerald said that many of the labs _
now in’ the State Hall, the oldest‘ '
building on campus and present‘
building ‘\fOI‘ Engineering and
Mines, will be transferred to the . _
new .structure. There will ‘also,
be room provided for The Sky-.'‘
scraper Engineer, the school’s stu-
dent publication now sharing th
Pitt News ofﬁce. . ~
‘ Dr. Fitzgerald also thanked.t__he
dinner guests for their ﬁnancial
aid to the University. He’_added?
-tlr_1at_this type of aid must con,-“
tinue if the ‘building campaign is
to be successful. ' ’ '
“This much needed‘ building
will be a shot in the arm for
the Schools of . Engineering and
Mines,” Dr. Fitzgerald added.
' Mentioned Cost
Expanding on his building cam- &
paign theme,‘ the Chancellor ' men-  ._ ‘
tioned ‘the Field House, costing‘ ‘
$1,500,000, the new Nurses’ Resi- -:'
dence to be occupied next week, . .
valued at $4,500,000, and a plan-”
ned $5,000,000 School of Public
Health. He also said that $7,000,- _‘ 
000 has been collected to_aid the
expansion of the School of Medi- 
cine.. A 
f Although he did not mention the
Student Union to the dinner -’
guests,-the Chancellor said in the‘
pre—banquet interview that a Stu- -
dent Union “means a great deal ‘
to a university” and it .15 his
“dream” for Pitt. I
.“All ,that stands. in the Way
of its construction,” he said,
“is the land necessary.” " .

Robert A. Schaef, instructor in

psychology, has been named win-
ner of the second Speech Correc-
tion‘Fund scholarship.
...The "recognition is for a year’s
study in the ﬁeld of speech handi-
caps, which cripple seven percent
of all American children of school
age. ‘  - <<

Under the grant, Mr. Schaef, an
assistant in the Vocational (Re-
habilitation Clinic, will‘ continue
his study toward a doctor of phi-
losophy degree in psychology.

This scholarship is made possi-
ble through a grant from Kappa
Delta Phi and awarded coopera-
tively.by the National Society for
Crippled Children and‘ Adults,
and the American Speech and
Hearing association. ‘

Mr. Schaef is a graduate of
Stanford University. A veteran of
World War II, he served with the

a poisonous gas. However they
combine to form common table

Proposal“ to l)ismiss 

Fifth Hour   
Meets Divided Opinion
A proposal to mzlaslze Naiizltitrirtigfghi-curricular instead ‘

Classes

extra-curricular by dismissing ﬁfth hour classes daily .was
suggested Monday ‘by the Student Chapel board. The com-

mon-free hour, under consideration by Student Congress, ‘A

and the administration, would enable students to attend

Chapel, school assemblies and or-¢
ganizatidn meetings. As in Con-
gress, the measure met divided
opinion. _ _ _
Mary Fuget, Col. ’54—“People
who want to be indifferent ac-
tivities at the same hour will have
to be split personalities.”
Maurice‘ Fried, Col. ’55-—‘-“I_’m
deﬁnitely against it. The_ Univer-
sity has gotten along for many
years without a speciﬁc ‘period for
activities. There would ' have to
be an extra .. hour in the day to
make up for the ﬁfth hour.”
Lois Tongue, Col. ’56.—“I be-
lieve it's worth a trial period.”
Ed Sharon, -Dental School——“I
don’t think’it’s a good plan. What
about the people who work after
school?- The free ﬁfth hour will
cut down on theirvworking time.”
Larry Florian, Col. ’54—-“I’m in
favor of dismissing ﬁfth hour, es-

of world aggression lies in reli-
gion and the hearts of men.
’Morton Blumenfeld, Col.—“I’m
in favor of this because many of
the students say that they do not
have time for activitiesheld in the
late afternoon or evening. This
will give those students a chance
to join clubs.” - '

Irene‘ Marsico, Bus. Ad ’55—“I
think it would be very good. The
Tuck Shop would be packed, but
it might eventually lead to, im-
proved facilities.”]

Chris Fourgis, Col. ’53—“A very
constructive proposal.~ It might
not enable 100 per cent improve-
ment in attendance, but it will

help those interested in activio _

ties.” '-

Marvin Kammsky, Col. ’55—“I‘i
believe we should have a common. _

free hour everyday for activi-
ties.

afternoon or evening.”

 

“P5551? '- , 5 B

' Ron E_cker, Bus. .Ad. ’53—“I‘
deﬁnitely feel -it would be ad-
vantageous to the student body
for many reasons.

there will be better "attendance at

Student Congress assemblies and.

the student body in general would
become more active.”

_ Teddi Arvanitas, Col.‘ ’54——.‘.‘1
favor the proposal. It should. bring

more people to chapel without“

making attendance compulsory.”
Nancy Creasey, Ed.—’54-—“A very

good idea. ‘Students won’t have-
to stay so late for activitypmeet-.

ings.”

Phoebe Nicholas, Col. ’53—-“It,

will _make the Tuck Shop even
more crowded." It will be another
hour for loaﬁng instead of stu-
dent activities.”- .

college students we have a great
challenge and a ‘great opportun-

which will help us grow to un-
derstand one another, our so-

ferent concept to different peo-
ple. It is a concept which to me
implies purpose. When men are

ideas as the Golden Rule. The.
Old Testament Prophet, Micah,
announced the following, which
can be a way to brotherhood:
“.What, doth the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, love
mercy, and walk humbly with
thy God?” Rudimentary justice

was legalistic—“An eye for an "I

eye, and 'a tooth for a“ tooth.’
Gradually men learned to tem-
per justice . with mercy, and’
further, yet have learned to
transcend both of these, at times,
to walk humbly with their God;

To me, one must love to bea '__.'l

brother; to be a brother “one
must beghumble before men; and
to be‘ humble before men is to
walk with thy God. V

Now,- the intial question—-

“Brotherhood, Dream or‘ Real‘-_ .

ity?”, The above expression of

my beliefs represents the theol,-, '
ogy which I try to live up to.’ I .
interpret brotherhood’

try to
through God. To me, the hum\an-p

_ist.W_h0 might interpret brother-

hood without God still worship:

God as -long as his central pur-j

‘pose is love. To be brothers men
need not agree point bylpoint on

“ theology, forms of worship, and
the like; they need only conform_ . 7

to possessing dynamic ‘ love
which transcends static religious

formality and oppressive racism. . ‘S

Today brotherhood is not a_ total
reality. There are evidences
about us, however, of how it is
gradually becoming more real.‘-I
feel, - that someday juniversalp
brotherhood will evolve+I_. jus-
tify this contention purely on"
emotional grounds; for it I have.

  ow: considers Plans.  
A To Balance Budget; 0 A.
Student Fee Suggested

—I_{arl Meyers,‘business manager. of the Owl, said today
that if Pitt~’s yearbook is to maintain and improve its stand-

ards, a student fee plan for payment of the Owl must be in--

troduced. ~

According to Meyers, need for such a plan presented it-

self in 1948. To date nothing con-
crete has been done. This year,
_enrollment has dropped, thus de-
creasing circulation.‘

The need for some sort of plan
to pull the Owl out of the red,

Where it’s been submerged for the '

past several years, is urgent, he
said. _ .
Proposals S_tated

According to Dean of Men,

' Theodore -W. Biddle, publications

board chairman, "a committee will
be appointed to-consider the fol-
lowing, proposals set forth by the
business staff of the Owl:~

"  Increasing. the price of the

r yearbook. _

'2. Imposing a fee on graduat-
ing seniors.

which the University ‘pur-

4. Compulsory payment to he

and thereby receiving the
Owl every year.

With one or more of the pro-
posed plahs in effect, the editor
could add ‘color pages, new sec-
tions, and improve quality in gen
eral, Meyers maintains. -

I Systems Used_ Elsewhere

Meyer states that comparable
plans‘ have been used by ‘other
schools with -‘success. Several
smaller ‘colleges put out year-
books which are better ‘in both
quality and size than the Owl
because of the use of such a plan.

By use of fee payment, $850
would automatically be cut from
the budget; This amount is usu-

. pally relegated to commissions for.

publipity and" salesmen.

Chance of ordering V .
too few books from the pubhsher

would be eliminated “completely.

“Russia will never run India.”
That’s the ﬁrm‘ belief of Wilbur

Newstetter, dean of Pitt’s School
of Social Work, who returned re-
cently from a three-week stay in
India. ~
But he adds ‘quickly, “Nor will
America ever run India, nor will
any other country.” ‘“

He’s very much impressed with,
the, Indian pride and spirit’ of C

progress shown to him during his
participation in the International
—Conference of Social Work at
Madras, India in December.
Studied Social Conditions
;[‘he group, which included dele-
gates. from 30 countries‘, studied
social conditions in various parts
of ‘India. . ‘ '
After years of British rule, In-

dia is still a little awkward in her

new independence, but, -says Mr.
Newstetter, “the country’s poten-
tialities are numerous.”

During his visits to Madras, New
‘Delhi, Agra, Bombay, Bangalore,
and Mysore, the dean was appalled
at the conditions in which the
poorer classes live. [Living con-
ditions, in Madras were_the sub-
'ject of alrecént article in Look-
magazine.] I

before the Eastern‘ Collegiate
championsliips next week. ,

Coach Ben_ Grady’s defending
ECSA champs are’ favored to rack
up their third win, upping their
ﬁnal record to 3-4-1.

Pitt Whipped. the Bobcats, 49-35,
last season and according to Grady,
“we should be able to score rather
easy against them. They don’t
rank in the same class with other
teams weive met to date,’ like

State.”

One of the top Bobcat scorers is-
Glenn Romanek, their Captain who
took a second in both the 200-yard
free style and the backstoke last
year.

Ohio, however, has lost its star
sprinter Ray Koster and many
other veterans, and-consequently,
have -eleven new men on the
-squad.

“There may be a few changes in
the lineup,” says Grady,’ “because
We’re getting ready for the East-
erns and we want the best possi-
ble combinations. The boys are
coming along good, though, and
i:hey’re getting down to business.”
