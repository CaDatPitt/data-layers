Groups Make
Plans for Joint
Student Forum

Hopes were high for an effective
forum and discussion organization
at the University as plans were
laid Monday afternoon to call a
joint meeting between executive
members of Inquiry Forum, Men’s
Debating Association, Women’s’
Speech Association, International
Relations Club, Peace Council and
interested faculty members.

Six Groups Meet

At a small meeting Monday of six
representatives of several of these
groups, an active discussion of plans
for a more effective forum and for
new discussion groups for the com-
ing y-ear led Esther l\/Iarcus-on... C41,
co-chairman of Inquiry Forum, to
call a meeting of students and fac-

ulty members for Thursday after-
noon at 2:45 o’clock.

Discussion centered around the
possibility of uniting active stu-
dents and faculty members in an
organization to present a program
of ( 1) speakers from off-campus,
(2) a Current Aﬁairs seminar en-
listing the aid of interested faculty
members, and (3) student panel
discussions and organized bull ses-
sions, like Lyman Bryson’s radio
‘Peoples’ Platform’ or the Univer-
sity of Chicago’s Round Table.

Efi’ect.iv_e Organization

The meeting was called as a re-

sult of Inquiry Forum’s., proposed
change of program, foreshadowed
by the Pitt News in an editorial
lvlonday, suggesting‘ consolidation of
forum efforts and asking for a co-'
operative organization among camp-
us groups to further an effective
discussion forum. The meeting was
above all, stimulated by the favor-
able results obtained by the faculty
Current Affairs Seminar this sum-
mer.

An authoritative source intimat-

ed that‘ chances were excellent for“

an effective organization of student
groups and faculty members whose
aim was to inform the students of
trends in social, political, and eco-
nomic change.

Famed Radio Announcer Enrolls
At Pitt As Aeronautical Engineer

By Georgia Shuset

The radio announcer who
achieved national and international
fame for his description of the Hin-
denburg dirigible disaster at Lake-
hurst, N. J., in 1937, has enrolled
at the University as an aeronautical
engineering student. He is Herb
Morrison. now a staff announcer
for WCAE.

Slowly sipping a cup of Tuck
Shop coffee, genial, grey-at-the-
temples Morrison said his interest
‘in the mechanical and designing
phases of aviation prompted his de-
cision to come to Pitt this year, but
insists that his coverage of the
Hindenberg disaster was not what
inﬂuenced him.

Whether or not it transferred his
interest in the direction of aeron-
autical engineering, Herb’s word-

by-word description of the airwex-V

plosion secured for him the nation-
al ‘merit award for outstanding ra-

dio work, and caused his name to
leap into prominence the world
over.

His was the only eye-witness de-
scription of the explosion. The
pleasant-mannered young announc-
or was then connected with Station
WLS in Chicago. Together with
Charles Nehlsen, the radio engineer
working with him, Mr. Morrison
received the Radio Guild’s special
medal for his outstanding work.

While working for Station WOR
in New York city, the eastern key
station of the Mutual network,
Mr. Morrison announced the pro-
gram of such big name—bands as
Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey,
Horaace Heidt, Isham Jones, Leo
Reisman, Xaviar Cugat, Bob Cros-
by. and Abe Lyman.

-Cyfrall the orchestra leaders he
has worked with, he liked Crosby
best. Herb has been connected with
radio in some way or other for the

past eleven years—-an old—timer in
a young business.

A graduate of Scottdale High
school and later a West Point cadet.
Mr. Morrisson says he first became
interested in radio work in 1930,
when he took his ﬁrst position in
the ﬁeld at Fairmont, W. Va., Sta-
tion WMMN——on Friday, June 13.
Later. he was made program direc-
tor of the station.

From Fairmont he went to Gary,
Ind.. to Mexico, and then to Wau-
kegan, Ill., Jack Benny’s home-
town.

The versatile radio announcer has
also had experience in newsreels,
having done some work for Para-
mount News. He has had a maga-
zine article published concerning
the relation of radio to aviation. Not
long ago, he was one of a small
ggoup of announcers who brought
an airship safely to earth. by radio,
after it was lost for some time near
the Eastern seaboard.

would be affected if China should
no longer be an independent and
sovereign power.

First prize in the contest was
won by Minerva F. Desing of the
University of Pennsylvania; second
prize by Richard» Curl, Ohio State
university; and the third award by
Helen Averitt of the Pasadena Jun-
ior college. '

Dr. Samuel Williams, professor

come speeches by William Ham-
maker, executive secretary of the
Y, and Harold Viehman, assistant
secretary; music by William Sher-
is, BA41, and Robert Thompson,

Together they can show «freshmen that the

;Edit_or, the Pitt News:
9 Talk about war will soon? begin sweeping over the
campus. Many students will be sincere in discuss-

ing the war, but more can be labeled as alarmists.

There will be those who like to. startle others by
their ‘knowledge of war comingwclose to home. They
were the ones who last year waited eagerly to stop
their friends and ask: “Did you know that four mem-
beis:4'of- the engineering faculty received orders from
Washington stating that not only are they not to leave
the city but also that they are to be ready to leave for
Washington within twenty-four‘ hours of notice?”

Otliers will try to turn their professors away from

the subect of the day to speculations about the prog-_

ress of the war.

Many students will step into an elevator and ex-
pect to have the war settled between the first and ﬁfh
ﬂoor.

. Interested and apple-polishing students will minglgf
in questioning those faculty members who have be"-
come recognized as experts on world problems. These
professors will rarely be through with their class when
it is dismissed. So enthusiastic will the students and
..ofteri 'the‘— professor become-that both are either late
for the next class or are forced to have a bit of lunch
in. the Tuck Shop.

-Off-the-record class room comment will be gob-
bled up by the students to_be cast out again as the
words of someone on “the faculty. 1

' Students will project their own predictions to that
“someone on the faculty” that their companion con-
veisationalists will be startled and lend credence to
the baseless mouthings. .

‘Less common than the rest is the fellow who sits
up all night listening to the propaganda broadcasts of
foreign. governments so that he can amaze his friends
with what he hears from London, Moscow, Berlin, and

. He invariably concludes his unasked for news-
casts‘ with—“and those are the official government
words.”

It won’t be long before you’ will again meet these
people and hear numerous versions of the--war.

The People’s Choice

The keener, more honest political observers felt,
saw, realized, and recorded the availability of Indi-

mained for astute newsmen Roy Howard and Hearst,
and Representative Bruce Barton to build the untamed

For Battleships

By Oscar S

It is almost universally agreed that preparation for
war is worth the price, even when that price runs
into the billions.

We havelcome to the realization that we must no
longer, as in the past, conduct ourselves with one eye
to the effect of our behaviour upon our enemies. The
world is at war. Hitler, moreover, needs no excuse
from us to justify attack.

What we overlook, perhaps, is the fact that, over
a period of time, preparation for war may not be
nearly so important as. preparation for peace.

No Rain For Umbrella Carrier
History, that truthful and pessimistic teacher, has
shown, time and again, that no nation can equip itself
for War without ﬁnally getting into a war. There is no
such thing is mobilization for peace.
It is aggravating when you carry an umbrella
all day and it doesn’t rain.

I suspect, too, that if you or I had the power, we
would make it rain just so we could raise our um-
brellas.

‘We don’t have the power to make the rain fall. but
we can make, or help to make, a war.

Ossy Admits Silly Idea

I don’t pretend to know the solution. The closest
thing I can ﬁnd iswthe suggestion. that we so con-
struct our battleships that they may be used as pas-
senger liners in time of peace; so construct our bomb-
ers that they can be converted into mail planes; that
we build tanks which may be regeared for power
rather than speed, to be re-adapted for farm tractor
purposes.

Silly, but that’s the idea.

Potts Directs
Big Prograin

Of Games

By Alex Zelenski

4 Intramural Athletics, having just
{completed its most successful year
in the history of the University of
Pittsburgh under the guidance of
Director James Potts, strives to re-
tain its great popularity on the
campus.

Director Potts, last year, added
Speedball and Wrestling to the "list
-of twelve sports making it the most
attractive in recent years‘.

It is not often that an organiza-
tion as large as the Intramural Pro-
gram fulﬁlls its aim and purpose,
but the desire of the school for all
boys to participate in some form of
activity, came as 5 close to fulﬁllment
as possible.

Fall Program

-"”Intra~rriura1'“fall ‘program is the
first of three to be offered to the stu-
dents of Pitt. This program will
include Touch Football, No. 1 in-
tramural sport, Speedball, Tennis,
and Horseshoes.

Touch Football, as usual, will re-
ceive the greatest number of en-
tries. Last year 13 fraternities en-
tered in their bracket, nine. in the
engineering league, and 10 teams
"vied for honors in the independent
race.

Competition in touch football will
be the same as last. year with seven
‘men on a team playing in the‘dou-

‘ble eli_minati-on“"setup. Entries for

this sport-close on October 4.

Speedball, the combination of
basketball, football, and soccer,
‘will attract many more than last
year due to it being its second year
(on the program. Although the nov-
elty of the game attracted the 18
‘teams that played last fall, a greater
number will be found next month
because of their fondness for the
‘game. Speedball will be scheduled
in the single elimination ﬂights of
eight teams each. Entries will close
on October 4.
‘Tennis Changed

Tennis is being changed this year

-from the single championship to

the double. This change was made
for the beneﬁt of the students as
it will allow more players to com-
pete. Any two students in the
"University may enter this sport;
entries close on October 4.

Horseshoe competition appears to
be the black sheep of quartet as
last year only eight teams competed
for the title. It will begin shortly
following the closing of theent,ries
on ‘October 4. I A '

All of these sports are open to
the students of the University
‘whether they are in an organization
or not. They need not belong to
gym periods as ROTC men, as
well as upper classmen, are plenti-
ful in the ranks of the intramurals.

 

TED KONETSKY
Captains Panthers

Tackle Named

Team Captain

Last surviving regular from Jock
Sutherland’s crack 1938 outﬁt,
Thaddeus “Ted” Konetsky, was ap-
pointed by coach Charley Bowser
as captairr - of‘ the ' Panther ._.pigskin.
tossers for the coming season.

A 198-pound senior tackle,
Konetsky has been classed as a reg-
ular the greater part of the past
three campaigns although repeated
injuries have kept him in drydock
for long periods of time. In 1938
he was the only sophomore on a
starting squad that showed nine
seniors and a junior, Cassiano.

Also during the'past two years
Konetsky has earned his letter in
track by tossing a discus around.
He was a member of SFA last year

and is a member of Kappa Sigma,
social fraternity.

Unpublished Facts ffeaeai
Pitt Lost Six Grid Openers

By Phil Lynch

The mighty University of Pitts-
burgh has boasted of a spotless
frst game record. Never in the
’r.istory of the University had a
bruising Pitt squad tasted the salt
of defeat in an opening encounter

. but alack.
9 It is not so.

It was way back in 1890, that
Pitt was humiliated for the ﬁrst
time. In the very ﬁrst game in
"Pitt football history, the University
of Pittsburgh suffered their ﬁrst
defeat. Large and mighty Wash-
ington and Jefferson tripped them,
34-0.

The ‘Gay’ Nineties

The 1890’s seem to have been
lean years for Pitt gridders. In
1891, once again they only met pul-
Verizing Washington and Jefferson.
And once again, in a ﬁrst game,
they were defeated, this time by the
score of 40-6. ‘

In 1892, they met two grid teams,
Geneva and once again, W&J.
They defeated Geneva in their ﬁrst
tussle, 6-4. The lads from down
Washington way set them back on
their heels again. The following
two years were a blank for the Pitt
gridders; they didn’t play in any
games.

In 1895, the grid schedule was
resumed with a fat one game card,
against the Blue and White of State
College. They lost to State 32-0.

The following three years tossed
Pitt into one game seasons.
the “Little Washingtoners” white-
washed them 28-0. State College
took them 10-4, in ’97 while Grove
City eked out a 12-10 victory in ’98.
"W. & J. Big Threat

They played in three games in
1899, winning two and losing one.
The one they lost was their opening
game and their conqueror, West-
minster, pushed across a lone touch-
down for their victory. It wasn’t
until 1901 that they gained revenge
of their previous W&J shellackings.

That year they pushed across two
touchdowns against their powerful
opponents. They missed the tries
for extra point. Nobody cared.
Only once again was a Pitt team

to be bettered by Washington and
Jefferson.

-“in 1902, ‘they lost their‘1ast open-5 I

In ’96, '

ing day game. State College walked
away with a 27-0 victory. That
too proved to be costly. Always in
the future did a Pitt teams tried
extra hard to defeat State. Usually
they did.

Won Since 1902

Since the early year of 1902, a
Panther football squad has never
been beaten in an opening game.
They were tied by_l/Vest Virginia in
1903. All the rest were victories.

Sport fans, do not be disheart-
ened. The beginning of modern
football was long_ after 1903. Pitt
has not lost an opening game since
that date’: Their record is spotless
as far, as modern football records
are concerned. Their position is
intact.

Ohio State also has claimed an
unmarred record. They too, have
suffered dillusions. For diminutive
Adelbert defeated them 50-6 in the
initial game of 1891. Oberlin wal-
loped them 40-0 in the early Sep-
tember of ’92. Otterbein walked
away with a 22-16 win the follow-
ing year. Buchtel added a fifth
straight opening game loss for the
Buckeyes when it copped a 12-6
decision.

All this, however has been before

ie ascendance of modern football.
The mars are there in the records
for anyone to look at and we are
more or less agreed to overlook
them. When the Panthers tackle
the Buckeyes in a few days, both
teamswill be ﬁghting to keep their
first game records intact. We wish
them both luck, but Pitt a little
more.

of the University.” The boys are
out for football ‘.;-ecause they like
the game and are eager to learn.
Lots of Training

r Coach Kliskey expects to give
them ‘plenty ‘of’ training. As is
traditional with Pitt freshman foot-
ball teams, a thorough grounding in
fundamentals will be stressed. Like
all Pitt coaches, Kliskey believes
that a team that can block and
tackle, and execute  few basic
piays with precision. is a team
capable of holding its own in any
competition.

Scrimmage won’t be on the frosh
menu for at least a week as coaches
Kliskey, John Dickinson, and Har-
old Klein. drill their squad with an
eye to perfection in fundamentals.
The mentor of the future Panthers
expects to form a 3"_’our or five team
league later in the season. Scrim-
mage with the varsity may be on
the schedule too, depending on the
development of the freshmen pros-
pects.

High school records aren’t the
basis of planning for this crop of
freshmen. Everybody gets a chance

‘to help make Pitt’s football “New

Deal” work. Coach Kliskey says
that he’d like to see “Every member
of the freshman class” come out for
football. ,

Skladany’s Return

7 Two ~of . the, prospects, the
Skladanys, -carry the name of one
of Pitt’s all-time greats. Both a
brother and a cousin of the one and
only Joe Skladany are among this
year’s able candidates.

Though the freshmen will engage
in no outside» competition, Pitt’s
strategy board is counting on the
spirit of a group that really repre-
sents the University to make this_
freshmen practice session one of
the most valuable ever held. Head
coach Charley Bowser is conﬁdent
that when the time comes to harvest
the crop Nick Kliskey is now plant-
ing, his membership in the Optim-

ists Club will be in no danger of
expiration.

Strausbaugh was a scourge to all
Big Nine foes as a broken ﬁeld run-
ner last year and from all reports
has lost no lustre in the early drills
of this campaign. At fullback
Langhurst hits the line with all
the smack of a pile driver.

ends. Overshadowed by All-Ameri-
cans Esco Sarkinnen last season,
Hershberger is expected to gain
stardom this season and appears on

die Dooley’s Football Annual.

in last year’s Minnesota battle. Jim
Daniell, brother of All-American
Averil, Pitt tackle deluxe in 1936,

grates very evenly with other tack

cohorts, Dixon, Stephenson, Pieci-
nini, and Thom.

The guard posts are in the ca-
pable hands of Howard and Nosker,
backed by Cliff Heffelﬁnger, dis-
tant cousin of the old-time Yale
star, and 'sophomoreu.Pete, SayreS.,.
son of the ’:‘Scar1eti”’: and Gray’s 1899
captain. At the pivot post, left open
by captain Steve Andrako’s gradu-
ation, returns Claude White after a
year’s absence due to injuries.

Cross Country
Season Begins

Four strong opponents for the
Pitt cross country team have been
selected by the athletic department
although the exact dates of the
meetings have as yet not been set.

In the coming year, the Panthers‘

will be up against such well bal-

Penn State, Purdue, and the Army.
With the exception of the Penn

to do their running.

Officials Plan Flying
Hours as CAA Class
Begins in State Hall

Ground Training Group Reduced
To 30 Members by Government

3. The first ground and flying course, under the Civil Aeronautics
a~,uthority aviation. and "ﬂight training program., opened last evening

in 202 State H311.  

Reprgesentatives from the Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics
met with the students at the initial class to plan ﬂight training hours

to be held at Bettiis ﬁe.1d.

‘The ground training class, which
has be_en reduced from '60 to 30
members by, government orders,
meets ever.3rEé;§1Tuesday and Thursday
evenings from 6:30 -to 9:30 o'clock
for 12 weeks. ,

Because ; of a new government
ruling, several changes had to be
made  the program. ' '

Students. must pay $25 for the
course which covers insurance,
medi-cal and, tuition: fees, providing
the ph‘ys.iCa.1 examination is passed-
Formerly the government paid the
University $50 per student from
which the University paid the fees.
Unde1"~ the new rulings, however,
the University,  not perrnitted to
pay the feesond those Who. have
niiid. the $6 medical fee not desiring
to t':31$.:‘3 the coins? under the present
pro,visions, will be refunded their
miiney.‘ I   »
Minimum Age 

The minimum age is 19 ‘under
the new’ ‘_r”uli‘ngs.,, requiriing paigents’
consent for "those under 21 ' years
of‘ age. _l?orIIi<,_?,I'1y the minimum
age lirnit was 18-. ”

In , ‘order, that i_st_udents may in-
clude..th‘e-.:cours'e in" the regular tui-
tion’ fee, credits must equal only 15,
including the training course.

“Men who are taking freshman
and" sophomore ROTC can register
for the ﬂight training course, the
next, class to begin in February.
Those in their . second and third
year of ROTC must choose’ between
the flying‘ course and a ROTC com-
mission, E. A. Holbrook, dean of
the Schools of l\/lines and Engineer-
ing, reveals,

Military ‘Call

Students who enroll in the course
are required to pledge themselves
to ﬁnish the full course, unless dis-
qualiﬁed by University- or aeron-
autics officials, and to apply for
ﬂight training in the military serv-
ice of the United States.

“You are not subject to immedi-
ate military call,” claims Dean Hol-
brook, “but the provision is inserted
-—-just in case.”

Graduates of the course, which
includes 18 hours of dual instruc-
tion and 17 hours of solo ﬂight, will
receive a private pilot’s license, pro-
viding the government tests are
passed.

- Applicants must have been en-
rolled for at least one year in the

 

University or two years in any other
accredited college, Dean Holbrook
announces. No women will be ad-
mitted. ' ~ --

The ﬂight training‘ will begin Oc-
t_ober l at the Bettis ﬁeld. Students
will provide their own transporta-
tion. No “hitchhiking” will be per-
mitted. 1

According to.Dean Holbrook, a
similar course taken at private in-
stitutions would cost approximately
$500. 1‘

Frosh Credits
Limit Raised

For the first time in several years,
freshmen will be required to take
physical education or ROTC in ad-
dition ‘ to their regular 15 "credit
courses. . . .

The following statement was is-
sued on Monday from the office ‘of
the provost: “Beginning with the
year 1940-1941, the minimum re-
quirements, for graduation are 120
academic credits plus two credits
in the required service course in
physical education or four credits

in the basic course in military sci-

ence.

“This does not apply in curricula
already requiring more than 120
academic credits such as engineer-

ing and the teachers’ tra.ining4pro— 9

gram in physical education.” V

For men students, exemption
from gymnasium classes and corre-
sponding credit for physical educa-
tion  allowed for participation in
athletics, upon recommendation of
the coach and with the approval of
the department of athletics. Any
man exempt from physical educa-
tion or ROTC upon the orders of
a physician is not required to sub-
stitute another course.

Women students excused from ac-
tive participation in physical edu-
cation are required. to substitute a
course in general physical educa-
tion.

Provost Fitzgerald explained that
physical education had been only
temporarily removed from the re-
quired list due to the lack of com-
plete gymnasium facilities in the
Cathedral.

Anonynious Presentation of Iron Gate
Helps Complete Commons Room

“Fifty thousand dollars have been
paid for similar gates, but our gate
has been made for such a reason-
able ﬁgure that it would be unfair
to the maker to tell its cost.”

So stated Albert A. Klimcheck,
University architect, as he leaned
back in his chair. “The Commons
Room Gate took a year to com-
plete. Samuel Yellin, probably the

greatest metal caaftsman in the
world, made it with the help of
from four to six men on his staff.”

Making its ﬁrst appearance this
fall, the Commons Room Gate, -an
anonymous donation, is a ton and a
half piece of wrought iron which
was a part of the original plans for
the Cathedral.

The quotation heading comes from
a secular ode on the Ninth Jubilee
