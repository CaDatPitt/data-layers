Salesmen Will Begin
.Owl Campaign Today

Identified by their new gold “1942 Owl Salesmen” rib-
bons, Owl salesmen are swarming over the campus today

tell them that the deposit on

senior yearbooks has been reduced from three dollars to two.

Undergraduates need make only
a one dollar down payment.
An additional payment is due

scheduled when the Owl appears
in May.

Cost of the 1942 Owl is the same
as in the past: ﬁve dollars for
seniors and three ﬁfty for under-
graduates.

Sales to seniors will be made by
members of their class who have
been given lists of students to con-
tact. '

Druids, national activities fra-
ternity for sophomore men, and
carefully selected students from
the freshman, sophomore and
junior classes, will make the bulk
of the sales to undergraduates.

- Thisryear, no speciﬁc apoint-
ments are being made for senior
pictures. Seniors will be notiﬁed
by mail and by the salesmen as-
signed to them as to what week
they may have their pictures
taken. "“i

Photo Reﬂex is devoting one
studio exclusively to Pitt seniors
and they may have their pictures
taken any hour, any day of the
week assigned to them. If they
cannot appear to have their pic-
ture taken during the scheduled
week, it is important that Dan
Mash, C43, circulation manager,
be notiﬁed immediately. A small
charge will be assessed on those
who do not do so.

Emphasizing the importance of
the Owl this year, Thomas Wester-
man, BA42, advertising manager,
said today, “We feel that under-
graduates and seniors alike will
want the Owl this year due to the
uncertainty of the present situa-
tion, and the possibility that it may
mean temporarily the suspension
of many student associations and
friendships because of service in
the armed forces.”

Fraternities
Keep lWeel<
Of Silence

Fraternity men will pass
through a period of anxiety
during the next seven days
while freshman men decide
upon the fraternity of their
choice.

lnterfraternity silence week,
which began at 2 o’clock yester-

5 o'clock Monday evening.

“No member or members,
pledge or pledges, of a fraternity
shall approach, talk to, or com-
municate by direct or indirect
means with any newly-registered
student,” according to the IF
handbook.

Sealed Bids

All invitations to pledge a fra- 4:

ternity shall be issued through the
office of the dean of men. Before
9:30 o’clock Monday, the fraterni-
ties will submit sealed bids to the
office for the students they wish
to pledge, and, beginning Tuesday,
interviews will be conducted with
these men to issue fraternity invi-
tations. A
One change has been made this
year regarding the method of in-
terview. Roy H. Umble, assistant
to the dean of men, stated that he,
Robert L. Arthur, assistant to the
dean, and Theodore W. Biddle, act-
ing dean of men, will conduct the
interviews in place of the usual
single interviews.
Silence Certainly Golden

“By this plan, we hope to give
more time to each individual in-
terview,”_ by Umble stated.

“We are going to rely on the
honor of the fraternity men this
week," Umble continued. “ll
think the house presidents would
do well to remind the chapter of
the silence rules. The freshmen
often know _them more thorough-
ly than the upperclassmen.

“A thoughtless or uninformed
member may ruin the rest of the
house by disobeying the rules.
Ignorance of the law can’t be x-
cused this time, for the man w o
breaks it is only cooking his own
goose."

Mr. Umble also stated that he is
quite optimistic regarding the nu1n-

ber of men who will accept bids ‘

SFA Publishes
Ballot on Smoke
For Last Time

The question of smoke control
for the Blue and Gold Tuck shop
was thrown squarely into the laps
of the student body today with
the announcement by Tom Gro-
gan, BA42, chairman of the SFA
statistics committee, that .a ﬁnal
ballot on the smoke control ques-
tion will be published in the Pitt
News today.

Grogan emphasized that this
would be the last time for mem-
bers of the student body to make
themselves heard.

William Clemmer, C43, chair-
man of the smoke control com-
mittee, reported last week that
it was only a question of suffi-‘
cient finances which was prevent-
ing a solution to the entire ques-
tion.

A From his conversations with
members of the university admin-
istration, Clemmer said he had
found that the system for intro-
ducing fresh air into the Tuck
shop was now*working, but that
the system of ducts which i-s in-
tended to clear the foul air of the
Tuck shop, is not yet operating be-
cause of lack of sufficient funds.

The smokein the Tuck shop, in-
stead of being led out through
the system of ducts is now being
squeezed out through the doors,
Clemmer said. * ‘ .

The national emergency has ef-

lfected a revisionﬂof the faculty

Mines‘, necessitating changing
abount one-third of the members.
A statement from the office of
E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
schools, revealed that 10 men have
been appointed to fill the posi-
tions vacated. Defense industries
and the various divisions of the
armed forces have requested the

men.

The position left vacant by J.
J. ‘ Rothrock, and

head of the department of in-

professor

dustrial engineering, who is now
. assistant to the chief engineer

employed by the Pittsburgh Or-
dinance division, and W. F. Ap-
plegarth, a lieutenant in the Army,

‘noon.’

For the following weekly meet
ing, Pitt Town meeting promises
to have Louis Dolivet, French
aviator who escaped from France
after the German invasion, as its
speaker.

Monsieur Dolivet has been ac-
tive in occupation free French
forces for General DeGaulle and
in cooperating with the Free
World movement. No deﬁnite
topic has been scheduled for this
meeting, as yet.

Students Asked
To Cease Using
Hotel Drive

University students who drive
to school were today asked by the
management of the Hotel Schenley

to cease using the driveways of p

the hotel for parking‘.

S. L. Benedito, manager of the -

hotel, said that at times the situa-
tion has become so serious that
patrons and guests of the hotel
are unable to use the driveways
to reach the entrances.

One student even went so far
as to park his car in the middle
of the road.

Benedito said that the manage-
ment of the hotel did not want to
inflict any hardships on students
but that those who have been
guilty of parking in the drives
must recognize that the guests of
the hotel should have right of
way. ’

He added that if students did

not heed his request, city police,

would be asked to tow away any
cars found parked in the drive-

-Some time ago the Pitt News

September 26 to 28, by the British.

The charter was framed by Sir
lRichard (}reg'or_1/, president of the

Alldred room shelves is Eugene
_Lyon’s “The Red Decade,” an at-

Those of you who have read
Lyon's “Assignment in Utopia”
know exactly what’ heisays in
“The Red Decade.” Lyons is a
man of passionate ‘intensity, and
he writes a lively prose; he is
hardly the man, however, to dis-

reader has some background

Most of the people who read
it, though, will read it for its

“Poems” by John Finley is a
collection of poetry written by the
late associate editor of the New

through it reveals that the less said

A really distinguished addition
to the Alldred room collection,
however, is Margaret Leech's

history that you read in text-
books. It has the animation and
creative, energy of three. good

satisfying to read.

though, he chose to let the Pitt

Professorial
Backfire

Only modest were repercussions
to PN’s editorial last week suggest-
ing the use of phonographs in
modern poetry classes.

These verbal ‘stink-bombs were
not dropped directly into PN"s of-
ﬁces; they were merely overheard
in an ascending ﬁfth hour elevator.
(Local and crowded.)

Least offensive examples:

“All you have ‘to do to learn
how to teach a class is to read the
Pitt News,” said an unidentiﬁed,
long, whitehaired professor.

“While. you’re pampering them
with‘ phonograph records, why- not
give them Scotch while they’re lis-
tening to Robert Burns, pretzels
and beer to Goethe, or spaghetti
and meat balls to Dante,” said an
also long haired, also unidentiﬁed
professor. ‘

“The idea is good, but it can
be carried too far. Can you im-
agine sitting in a dentistry class
and listening to the buzz and

‘scrape of a drill on somebody’s

pet_molar,” said a -still unidenti-
ﬁed adviser to - student publica-
tions. I

However smelly the professorial
criticisms, they are still refreshing.
At least PN is read if unrespected.

Negro Rights and Priveleges

' The Should Be Equal and 1-" air

By MARTIN LU BOVSKY

In the °°nStit“ti°“’ by ‘3°mm°n‘ Hughes summed up his people’s ex- assuming an integral part in our’ 3

ly accepted concepts of moral
right, in the eyes of civilized, ra-
tional people the world over, the
Negro has a perfect right to a re-
spect and consideration equal with
that shown to any other race.

In the light of his treatment by
the magnanimous, God-fearing,
democratic American Caucasians,
it wouldn’t be unreasonable for
the Negro even to expect special
consideration toward the solution
of his problems. However, he
would be the- last to ask for un-
equal privileges, as he knows they

carry with them the seeds of jeal-

We think that economic oppor-
tunity, which includes largely
educational opportunities, and
decent housing, would eventually
secure the other modest sjeques-its.

Given a chance to raise his eco-
nomic status, the Negro would

One of the more interesting ex-
changes that comes» into this of-
fice is the student publication of
Sydney (Australia) universit --
“Honi Soit.”

Least inhibited part of the pa.-
per is the editorial column,
which in a recent issue, tookthe
stucﬂ, at body for a; somewhat
bumpy ride.

Intended as an answer to a pro-
fessor’s complaint that “Honi Soit”
lays too much emphasis on “minor
problems” and does not concern it-
, self enough twith important aca-
 demic questions, the edit was en-
titled “Grin and Be Damned."

One paragraph that fascinated

A us stated: “How many students
here lgsve said one decent
thought worth reporting this
year? Show us ten" student “po-
ets” who are not weak and roman-
tic; a hundred student “think-
 .ers"' who do not suffer from scho-
lastics or hysterics; two hundred
ordinary students who are not all
wood from the chin up . . . and
we will fill our pages with their
lives and work."

Long an admirer of the unre-
 strained, we envy the editors of
“Honi Soit.”

Theirs is the free soul, the
spirit unshaclsled, the mind up-
lifted. 1

We always like to read about
anti-noise campaigns.

They're so invariably futile.

The latest one to strike our fan-
cy is the American Municipal as-
sociation’s suggestion that police
‘departments send all marriage li-
cense applicants a letter urging
co-operation in “eliminating the
thoughtless and nervewracking
practice" of noisy wedding parties
streaking through the streets with
auto horns blowing.

This, we think, is the ﬁnal tes-
timony of our progress; When
the authorities can take it upon

sincerest wishes for success-——to

To Sea”----

' -By CHARLES FINEMAN
V (The following is the second of
two reviews o_f Jllikhail Sholokhmfs
two Cossack novels. The first arti-
cle was a review of “And Quiet

Flows the Dan.” The second deals

with the latest volimw, “The Don

Flows Home to Sea.”)

The second volume “The Don

Flows Home to Sea,” takes up
 Gregor’s part in the civil wars of
1918 to 1921. This time Gregor
» is lined up with his beloved Cos-

sack people- The individualistic,

savage‘Cossacks will not, and can-
~- not, adjust themselves to the new
Soviet regime.
Gates of Moscow
The Cossacks become the back-
bonenof the White army. It is
, they who drive up the Don basin,
 almost to the gates of Moscow.
Gregor, in this army, is a leader
of the cavalry, commander’ of a
squadron.

Butthe White ‘army slowly dis-
iintegrates as more and more of
, the Cossacks feel the urge to re-
i turn home. Finally the Red army

breaks them, splits them into frag-
ment bandit groups, with Gregor

' as leader of one.

His reputation grows, and he
becomes a hunted man. Reduced
to lonely flight, he makes one
more attempt to gather up the
broken strands. He returns home
to Askinia, and once again they
take ﬂight together. A stray bul-
let kills her, and Gregor’s ﬂight
can only end in death.

Finely Drawn Mistress

A host of minor characters
crowd the book, some ﬁnely drawn
like the ﬁgure of Askinia—-—Greg-
or’s mistress. Particularly in the
second volume, she is a feminine,
wholly and complete. She be-
comes a living symbol of home to
the men ﬁghting abroad.

The ﬁgure of Pantaleimon is

V  sharp and . clear. Rapacious,
greedy, and cruel, he laughs as
he plunders the home of a White
 army, ‘widow, cries at the death
of*his¢_son_, and brags with gusto

“Don Flows Home

Sholokhov

army gunner, is unreal and weak.
So is his mistress, Anna. The ﬁg-
ures of the White army generals
and leaders are weak. But,‘al-
though Sholokhov is undoubtedly
prejudiced, he does admit their
courage.

The format of the book is un-
usual. American readers know
the curious telescoping scheme of
John Dos Passos’s bboks——a whole
chapter is crystallized, then drawn
out and expanded. Sholokhov
uses the same technique.

His style is accurate, realistic,
and sometimes lyrical. He retains
a sense of frustration and despair
in his choice of words. Particu-
larly is this true when he speaks
of {Gregor’s longing for peace in
the‘ midst of war. Symbolically,
this ache is illustrated by the Don
river. Time and time again, Gre-
gor returns to the memory of the
Don——and it means peace.

Death and Blood”
Yet Sholokhov is cold and un-

wavering in his accuracy. Cal-
loused to death and blood, his
coldness reduces death to a me-
chanical, natural function.’

In, conclusion then, both vol-
umes, “And Quiet Flow-s the Don”
and “The Don Flows Home to
Sea,” are a chronicle of a man—-
lusty and sensual, driven by his-
torical coincidence into a conflict
of old and new.

The conflict destroys him, his
love, and his world. It is safe to
say that Sholokhov has given us
a dynamic insight into the lives
of a people caught in war, and
one that lives up, for a change,
to its vaunted press notices.

”Nc1z‘1'Ve Son ” Ba 
Oomph Gc1]Sherjdc1n

At the Nixon . . .

To take the place of “Separate
Rooms,” probably one of the most
insipid and vapid items ever to
register an enviable New York
run, the Nixon brings back tonight
Richard Wright's melodramatic
“Native Son.” '

When thisrather violent adap-
tation of Mr. Wright's widely read
novel played the Nixon two weeks
ago, it closed to capacity. With
a dark week facing him due to the
recent premature folding in De-
troit of the intimate revue, “Meet
the People,” manager Sam Nixon
snared “Native Son” for the
quickest repeat on record in Pitts-
burgh theatrical annals. .

A Versatile Bigger

Many University people saw the
play during its ﬁrst engagement
here. Most of them are still talk-
ing about the performance of the
Negro actor, Canada Lee. As the
bewildered Bigger Thomas who ac-
cidentally murders his white girl
employer, Lee gives a clean, hon-
est driving performance that de-
mands versatility.

Audiences a fortnight ago were
not so impressed, however, by the
staging of the boy genius, Orson
Welles. Slanting sets, ﬂashing
guns from balcony boxes, disturb-
ing street noises backstage only
made the spectator conscious that
he was watching a play and not
undergoing a vicarious experience.
Less of Mr. Welles’ art and a lit-
tle more of Mr. Lee’s acting with-
out interference from artiﬁcial
stimuli might have produced a
more desirable effect.

Half Is White

About half of the cast of “Na-
tive Son” consists of white play-
ers. The rest of the parts are
taken by Negroes. White actor
John Berry is convincing as he
goes through one of the largest
speecheswritten in recent years.
This is his plea as the lawyer de-
fending Bigger——not on the facts.

of the case which are hopeless——-
but on the causes of Bigger’s psy-
chological tangle.

Welles sustains an latmﬂosphere
of stark melodrama throughout
the action.‘ -This may provoke
some thinking, but, at the same
time, the technique is all pretty
theatrical.

Ann’ Sheridan, the gal who

Strauss Opera
With Symphony

Accompanied by Dr. Fritz Reix
ner and the Pittsburgh Symphony
orchestra, Lotte Lehmann, who
has been acclaimed as “one of the
greatest dramatic singers of our
time,” will sing excerpts from the
opera, “Der Rosenkavalier,” Sat-
urday evening, October 25, and
Sunday afternoon, October 26, at
the Syria Mosque.

This is believed to be the first A

\\ time this opera, by Richard
Strauss, has been performed in
concert form by any symphony
orchestra.
Lotte Lehmann will sing the
part of Feldmarschallin, principal
role in the opera.

Selected by .the foremost con-
ductors and composers for prin-
cipal operatic roles, she wasalso
chosen by Toscanini for the “Fi-
delio” performance which he con-

ducted at the Salzburg ‘Festivﬁl '

in 1935. Richard Strauss com-
posed his latest opera, “Arabel-
la,” for her. 7
In addition to the excerpts from
the opera, Dr. Reiner has schedul-

ed for the first half. of the pro- ,
gram, ..Mendel-ssohn’~s overture to

“A Midsummer Night’s Dream,"
and the Mozart Symphony No. 29

“It won’t be difficult,” Mr. Yen claim:ed..“ ‘Yellow 3

Jacketf as it is written is as near an approach to
Chinese drama as could be understod by Western
audiences.” V . v — -

Mr. Yen explained that it is a fantastic conception
of the popular Chinese theme of family relations, in
which the hero struggles through many adversities

‘ to be elevated in the end. He added that the au-
thors must have a “profound knowledge of Chinese
theatrical conventions" to have conceived such a
drama. , . ’ ’ ‘ — I

“However, the plot is tooexaggerated at times

to be pure Chinese. drama," he added. Stating

jztliat th'e,proper.ty. man. is» essential to the Chinese
. theatre, since the stage must be "set without bene-

ﬁt" of curtain, he admitted that he is nevertheless
more “relevant to the action’? and shows more re-

“Chorus,” the narrate;-_,,never appears on_the

'Relating‘~{the h’istory.-of»: Chinese drama‘; Yen re-
vealed that it datedaba-clcvto the. tenth century and,
since that time has developed along very primitive
lines. He compared the Chinese reference of “sym-
bolism” over"‘realit.y” to the paintings of the mod-
ern impressionistic school which attempt to show
the “spirit” rather thanthe object itself.
Chinese drama is properly referred to as “Chinese

1 opera,” for the average theater-goer preferssong

to plot. ~ ' L ._ .

"“‘Of course, the singing i_sn’t'very _good,”"Yen
said modestly. “Since the acting profession is"
looked down upon_ by most people, the performers
seldom try to attain great heights.” in V

Yet many people go to the old theatres in Peking,

The costumes used in “Yellow Jacket” are quite
authentic, Mr. Yen said, and the paint used on

merelyito givena grotesque‘ apeparance. To the
seasoned Chinese audience, theldifferent strokes
of "the brush and the colors used denote a" deﬁnite
individual, whether he be legendary hero or mod-
.ern idol. '
About one out of every 10 students in Chinese
universities know something about “Chinese opera.”

Graduate Examinations

The Civil Service commission
has announced an examination
under the title of “Junior Profes-
sional Assistant.” Because of the
great demand due to the defense
emergency, this examination will
be given to augment the registers
previously established for junior
technicians, busi-
ness analysts, and econ.omists.

“Junior Professional Assistant”
examinations are intended to pro-
mote a career service‘ in govern-
ment professional and scientific
fields. Requiring no experience,
they enable the college graduating

was a four year course. And
that a diploma was necessary to
get a job.

But Uncle Sam has proved him
wrong. Theassignment is a lit-

planned, but at least he is “in

Last cel<

Business in‘ the Pittsburgh area
dropped considerably last week,
the University Bureau of Business
Research reported Friday.

Large decreases in department
store sales, freight shipments,

spite moder-
ate rises in

Although
business for
g the week was
down 2.5 per cent from the previ-
ous week, it showed 26 points
above the 1929 average.

Steel operations remained con-
stant at 98:5 per cent of capacity
and the number of blast furnaces
in operation was unchanged. 9

A sudden increase in Pitts-
burgh department store sales
during the last week of Septem-
ber was ‘attributed to the 10 per
cent luxury tax which went into
effect October 1. A buying spree.’

between September 20 and the

"first of ‘tl1e._xr1_onth,
In spiteof the decrease insales
after the tax became effective, the
total dollar sales for the four
weeks ending Octoberll exceeded
by 20 per centthose of the same
four "weeks a year ago.

‘While making no pretense of
proving the worth of radio as an
advertising medium for, depart-

reau survey does‘ indicate that
some radio people have refused to

Department stores studied were ,
‘from 13 states located in the ’east- ‘
‘ ern, central, and western coastal‘

‘states.

More than this, the percentage
of stores with sales ‘volumes of
$100,000 or under and those with
$100,000 to $500,000 that. adver-
tise by air, is the same as those big
concerns that do up to and over
a ten million dollar business an-
nually.

Commenting on the rate of re-
turn from radio advertising as
compared with that from other me-
dia, Garber explains that many of
the replies received are unques-
tionably assumptions, but adds,

“A public that has been edu-
cated to read relatively heavy de-
partment store newspaper adver-
tising for 40 years or more can-
not be expected to react equally
,to light department store radio
publicity of a few years stand-

newspaper advertising over radio
appeals. In reply to the question,

To Study  

Freshmen from most of
undergraduate: " schools «of the
University soon will latend four
lectures on ast'ro"nomy' in Buhl
planetarium, Provost ~ ‘Rufus H‘.
Fitzgerald announced today.

The course, first of its ‘kind
ever to be presented by Pitt will
be given by Dr. N. E. Wagman,
astronomer at Allegheny observ-
atory and instructor in astronomy,
and will be presented during the
hours at which» freshman orienta-
tion classes are scheduled to meet.

The chief purpose of the course,
said Fitzgerald, is “to awaken the
interest of the ‘young people in
science at its most meaningful
level.” 5

Under tentative plans, the noon
hour preceding the time of the

lecture will be used by students

to reach the planetarium. , A
Some difficulty may be ex-
perienced in arranging for the
attendance of engineering fresh-
men at the lectures "because of
their intensive schedules of study,
Fitzgerald said. _

This difficulty is now being
considered by E. A. Holbrook,
clean of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines, and. members of
the engineering faculty.

Plans for the four lectures to
each orientation class -have not yet
been completed but full details
of the program will .be published
as soon as it has been approved.

Pant ers,

 

It’s an old adage that repeats itself, and it was the same
Pitt team that was crushed’ by Michigan a week before that
traveled to Minneapolis last Saturday and watched the na-
tional champions of 1940 tally through the air and on the
ground six times in running up a 39-0 score,

Although, at times, playing better ball than inthe two

previous encounters, the clawless Panthers emerged from
the game with their third straight defeatand still seeking
their ﬁrst touchdown of the 1941 football season.

As has been the usual story, Pitt played convincing ball
throughout the ﬁrst quarter, but then crumbled as the Min-

nesota juggernaut went to wo

rk with clocklike precision.

Coach Bernie .Bierman kept a continuous stream of
footballers coming into the game for 45 playerswerel listed

in the ﬁnal tally. All-American
Urban Odson, and right halfback
Bob Sweiger sat on the bench
during the entire game, resting
for their contest with the Wolver-
ines from Michigan next Saturday.

Smith Rolls Up Sleeves

The Panther b acks never
smelled pay dirt throughout the
afternoon, but they frequently
broke through the supposedly in-
vincible Gopher line to chalk up
13 ﬁrst downs. The Minnesota
squad made only 11 ﬁrst downs.
but, unfortunately, the ﬁnal result
is reckoned with the touchdowns
not ﬁrst downs.

Jack Stetler and Edgar Jones
were the onlyvBowsermen to stand
out during the afternoon of play
for they thrilled the 35,000 fans,
who sat through a light rain, with
their spectacular running, passing,
and kicking.

Pitt started the game on the

I

lwrong foot at the outset when Ed-

gar Jones fumbled a Minnesota
punt on his own 30-yard line,’ and
a Gopher player recovered. But
this break was short lived for Joe
Connell intercepted a pass in the
flat and scampered to amid-ﬁeld.
The rest of the quarter saw both
teams feeling each other out as
the period ended 0-0.

. Captain Bruce Smith, one of the
standout backs in the country,
then rolled up his sleeves as he
took the ball through the line for
a 35-yard gallop to the two-yard
line. It was a very easy task for
burly Bill Daley to take it over,
and the score was 7-0. Just a few
minutes later that Smith boy ran
around end for 19 yards to the
Blue and Gold’s 13-yard line." Once
again Bill Daley took it, and once

. But at the moment, we have a
‘_bit of verbal steam-blowing to
qdo onythe attitude of the nation’s
, professional sports Writers in re-

gard to the gridiron situation at
this University.

0’ Not‘ too many years ago, the
ysynclicatecl and local gentlemen
were overjoyed with the oppor-
tunity to cast aspersions on the
football setup at Pitt. ‘lt seems
that the Panthers were winning
too many games too often. After
', list week’s Michigan contest, the

writers dug up some additional
;,i uncomplimentary adjectives, and
“proceeded to give the reading
C’ public more of the same. Only
i this time, our boys were being
3 “spanked for losing the previously
1 undesirable winning habit.

But the sports writers neglected
. to point out one of the very bene-
‘ "Yﬁcial results of the sudden but
Vgradual about-face. Six years ago,
citizens of the We-st Coast knew
the University of Pittsburgh only
 “that gridiron powerhouse.”
Today, the mention of ‘Pitt recalls

Sciences or the very reputable

Oddly enough, “book larnin”’
and not a ninety-yard punt is still
the prime‘ purpose of a University.

However, what the football
fans and writers obviously want
is a happy medium; one where
the team is on. a respectable basis,
both in its comp‘e'titi‘on and its
creation. That, undoubtedly is
the-ultimateaim, here. But there
must‘ be a ‘deﬁnite dividing line

between the grid sport of old,
and that of the “happy medium"
variety in view. Our present

plight is THAT dividing line.

Patience at the moment, will
prove a. virtue. There are better
things to come. Before long, it
is hoped that the potentialities of
the team will match the potency
of the schedule. A little less pois-
on on the pen and a little more
encouragement from, the fan will
do much to ease a very tedious
process. .. ‘

again the Gophers scored.

The ‘Pitt footballers breathed a
little easier a few-minutes later,
when they saw Smith pull up with
a strained back muscle, and a little
fellow by the name of‘ -Higgins
come into the game. Higgins.
weighing all of 155 pounds took
the ball on the ﬁrst play and ran
19 yards before the Pitt secondary
realized that it was a. football play-
er not an automobile running past.
Then little Robert took the ball
for seven yards. The Gopher quar-
terback then gave Higgins a rest
on the next play, but on the fol-
lowing play——swish, and he was
gone. Gone for 47 yards and the
third .Minnesota touchdown.

Higgins Or lackrabbit?

It didn’t take the Gophers long
to get going after the intermission
for they struck three more times
in the third period. Jackrabbit
Higgins was instrumental once
more as he grabbed the Pitt kick-
off and ran 70 yards down the field
to the Pitt 20. His teammate,
W'arren Plunkett, was hit hard on
the next play and fumbled the
ball to the Panthers. But that did
not stop Higgins for a few plays
later he received Jones’ punt and
ran 50 yards upﬁeld to the Pitt 20.
Two more plays with Higgins car-
rying the ball saw the Gophers
fourth touchdown go up on the
scoreboard.

The rest of the contest turned ,

into a rout as Garnaas intercepted
Connell’s long heave, and ran 68
yards with interference for the
ﬁfth tally. The game was almost
over when Higgins exploded for
the last, time, and -swung wide
around end on his own 45, cut
toward the middle, and was away

’until Stetler nabbed him on the-

Pitt 14. He then went through
the line for four yards, pasesd to
Plunkett for ﬁve, then crossed the
double stripe for the Gophers’ last‘
score of the game. ‘

Over a murky, muddy, rain-
drenched Schenley park course,
the University of Pittsburgh cross-
country team fell before a slightly
superior Michigan State squad,
last Saturday,.as Bill Curtis, Pitt’s
sensational sophomore cinderman
eased into ﬁrst place, more than
twelve seconds ahead of the pack.

The Panthers were on the long

‘end of the score, it being 21 to

34. But in cross-country mathe-
matics, low score _wins.

Four Michigan Staters ﬁnished in
back of Curtis. Coming in second
was Walt Beardslee, in 23 min-
utes, 46 seconds. Team-mate
Ralph, Monroe trailed by only one
shfoi-. second. Then came Walt
Mack, who led Curtis at the one-
mile mark, and R. C. Thompson,
trailing the leader by a minute.

'Marcus Allias, found himself 2

alfdisappointing _tenth at the end
of the first mile. But with a ter-
riﬁc burst of power in the clos-
ing seconds of the’ race, Allias
crossed the finish line, sixth, by
three seconds. 1
Two State men battled for the
seventh and eighth positions, with

.*M. L. Horskiscoring ﬁve seconds,
ahead of his running mate, Earl-

BILL CURTIS
cuts tape first

in 25:19.

Behind Brosky were Bob Davis,
Jim Saunders, and Bob Graham.
Davis seemed to be rather slow
in starting and by the time he
had hit his peak, he was a little
too far behind. Saunder’s bruised
leg was a deﬁnite handicap.

As mentioned before, Bill Cur-
tis was behind Walter Mack at
the one mile mark. But when
the two mile post was reached,
Curtis had the lead and never
relinquished it.

Saturday’s race -was Curtis’ ﬁrst
taste of varsity collegiate cross-
country competition, and his per-
formance is indicative of a very
promising future. The Panther
sophomore is a hard working, con-
scientious sort of fellow, and his
victory against the powerful

 Michigan State squad is just what

the doctor ordered.

By their respective perform-
ances, the State boys deserve a
good bit of praise. Last year,
they ﬁnished a dangerous second
in the lC4A’s. In the past six
years, Michigan State has taken
the lC4A crown four times. With
that record, a victory over the

: Panthers wasn't too surprising.
 But Panther Coach Olson did
not view the defeat as a disap-
pointing one.

Carlson ’.s  Now Famous System
Once Ridiculed by Reporters

By ELAINE KAHN .
H. Clifford Carlson, M.D., who
doubles as head of the Student

,Health service and as coach of the

Pitt Basketball team has answered
to the simple appelation of “Doc-
tor.” for so long that he has almost

._ forgotten his given name.

‘Carlson has been coaching Pitt
basketballers for twenty years and
during that time he has managed
to win national recognition as an
authority on the game, for the
doctor is, according to those who
know, the only original coach of
basketball today. The , Carlson

system of playing has been adopt-

éd and developed by almost every
basketball coach’ in the country. .
He is the progenitor of the fig-

ure eight continuity, a play that -

is built about the idea that every

time the ball is passed the entire 

team moves. The good doctor

well remembers when this play ,

brought him ridicule from the
press and compares this attitude
with the fact that today he is paid
to lecture on it.

In the twenty yearshe has been
coaching, Carlson has produced
some great teams but he considers
the team of 1928 that went
through an entire season without

a defeat his greatest.

He has developed some outstand-

ing players such as Charley Hyatt,

Wednesday.

In defense of the physical
education course and the pros-
pects for a job in the ‘future,
herein is related a little incident.

Seniors Harriet Harris, V Jac-
queline ‘Fike and Obienne Mc-

Donald, were driving‘ home from.

after a few hours of practice
teaching. It was raining-——hard.
And naturally, they got a flat

in about fifteen minutes flat. .

last week,

-Claire Cribbs, Skippy Hughes, and
Don Smith. In fact, so well does
Dr. Carlson teach his men to shoot
that one of his boys is now a full-

‘ ﬂedged G-Man.

Off the basketball court the
doctor is equally famed for his
stories and jokes. He has a story
for every occasion and if he has-
n’t onevon hand it doesn't take
him long to make one up. Sic:
the story of the woman who won
a game for Pitt. It seems a
squeamish female was sitting next
to the timekeeper. The team;
were deadlocked in a tie score as
the timekeeper raised his gun to
signal the end of the game. The

.W°man grabbed his arm shouting s

“Don’t.shoot" and at the same
moment a Pitt player tossed the
ball into the basket for the win-
ning point. .

Carlson is an extremely colorful
character, so much so that stories
about him have become legend.
The doctor denies that he fails to

"take his -own medical advice con-
cerning worry at the games, but
those who have watched him agree
that, while he may call it by an-

other name, his actions at the

game are hardly those of a calm,
untroubled individual. During the
game with Westminster last‘ year
the doctor signaled for a time out,
but the clock continued to move.
This so enraged him that he picked
up every jacket and tossed them
out on the ﬂoor.

Carlson has written several
books on basketball and many arti-
cles. His most recent book, “Bas-
ketball, ‘The American Game,” was
published in 1938.

Fall Basketball Practice    

Continues Spasmodically.

Dr. Carlson, Pitt’s basketball
coach, is a pretty even tempered
man. But last week Dr. Carlson
lost his temper and is now sizzling.
The indirect cause of it all is the"
rain of last week. The real cause
of the doctor’s burning up is four
of his basketball players. 7

It seems that these sturdy and
able bodied men are afraid of a
little rain. Anyway, they failed
to show up for one of the open-
ing practice sessions last week and
Dr. Carlson feels that now is the
time to lay down the law. The
four men, whom the doctor identi-
fied as “Big Talk,” “Too Good,”
“Twinkletoes,” and “Bright Eyes,”
are now in the well known dog-
house.
