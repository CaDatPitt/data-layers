Carter By A Smile,

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated
President Ford and won the White
House early today, ending eight
years of Republican rule and
crowning his long campaign out of
the political wilderness.

A close race in Mississippi edged
Larter over the 270 electoral vote
to make him the 39th
President of the United States.

Jimmy Carter swept out of the
South and held a steady lead over
President Ford as the votes were
counted in a close White House
contest that hinged on the verdict of
big, battleground states in Amer-
ica's industrial heartland.

Carter was gaining 51 per cent of
the popular vote, and held a
three-point margin over Ford, with
more than two-thirds of the nation's
precincts counted. In the competi-
tion for electoral" votes, where it
counts, his margin was wider.

Larter had won 19 states.

Ford had captured 18 states with
120 electoral votes.

By the account of his
campaign manager, Ford needed a
sweep of the uncommitted big
states if he was to gain the mandate
he sought so long as an appointed
President. p

With 70 percent of the national
precincts reported, Carter's victory
column showed a roster of the
South.

Along with New York and
Pennsylvania, Carter carried Texas,
Florida and Massachusetts which’
put five of the 10 biggest
states—_the arenas in which Presi-
dential elections are won or
lost—into his column..

At the request of New York State
Republican ‘Chairman Richard
Rosenbaum, a New ‘ York‘ State
judge ordered the impoundment of
all voting machines in New York

Campus Police Walk on Job ORL. RSA. Try to Build
1   Security  Campus  

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Campus Police ofﬁcers walked off

their jobs Monday evening follow- '

ing a 38-0 vote to reject the
University’s ﬁnal contract proposal.
Chief union steward John Forgis
notified Pitt Labor Relations
Manager Tom_ Cherry _of the
walk-out late Monday. i
“Although all of the men did not
actually participate in the vote to

accept or reject the ﬁnal proposal, ’ ’ I

Forgie said, ‘ ‘we feel that they were
represented by those who did
vote.” . .
According.to Cherry, no date has
been set to re-open talks between
the University and Amalgamated
Plant Guards Union Local 502.
“Campus beats will be patrolled

‘ by supervisory staff of the’ Campus 1

Police,” Chief Cur.t_ Graham said
yesterday. “They, will be working
twelve-hour shifts, from seven to
seven. Two cars and one ambulance

will be on patrol at all times, and we .

hope to cover all beats efﬁciently.”

The present emergency force has
one certiﬁed Emergency Medical
Technician and i one ﬁrst aid
instructor.

“Wages were the major item of .

disputs,” Forgie said following the
vote. '

The university had increased its
previous offer of 60 cents per hour
over three years to 78 cents over
three years. That offer was rejected
in Monday's vote. .

Local 502 is currently asking for a
$1.50 per-hour increase over the
next three years, ‘ along with an
additional ten cents per hour for the
3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift and an extra
15 cents for the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.,
shift. ‘ ‘

The union: is asking" for twelve.

week for a maximum of thirteen
weeks per year.

The University is offering six sick
days with beneﬁts of $60 per week,
with a $10 raise per year over the
next two years. i

The pension plan proposed by the
University would involve $20
contributed from the ofﬁcers and

' $40 from the University in 1977.
This would increase to $25 from/the "_

contract talks until-Aug. 6, although

‘ our contract expired 'June 30,”

Forgie said.

Cherry said talks were delayed
because‘ the University was not
ofﬁcially notiﬁed by the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board until
mid-July about the ofﬁcers’ change
from the Teamsters to their present
union.

The advent of the Campus Police
strike has heightened Office of

Residence Life concern for resident _

security and precipitated increased
security measures in the dormi-
tories, according to Director of
Residence Life Fred Fonseca.

Resident Assistants have been '

directed, Fonseca said, to increase
security tours by conducting two
extra lflooricliecks after 8 p.m. on
weekends. and one extra tour
weekdays after 8 p.m.

Fonseca said these tours amount

3 to nine additional hours of security

coverage weekly until the strike is
terminated. To date, Resident

. Assistants were required to conduct

security tours twice each night.

“All staff members, especially
those on duty, will be expected to
assist students,” Fonseca said.

Fonseca stressed that with police
coverage at a minimum, students
‘ ‘should keep their doors lockedand
be especially suspicious of abnor-
mal occurrences and behavior.”

“If a situation warrants police
action, students should call the
Campus Police because there will
be someone at the desk to receive
calls,” Fonseca said;

Campus beats will be patrolled by i

the Campus Police’s supervisory

staff working twelve hour shifts

during the strike. .
Despite the walkout, Fonseca is

While the Office of Residence

Campus Police strike, the Resident
Student Association (RSA) has met
a few legal snags in forming the

‘body patrol,’ a resident student ’

escort service for students ventur-

The proposed body patrol, which
calls for volunteer student escorts
screened by the RSA, will have to be
researched extensively from a legal
perspective before it can begin

operation, Alden Bowen, coo'rdina- ’

said yesterday. -
“The service will have to

A University-wide swine ﬂu

A definite date for the service

he anticipates a target date in two or
three weeks.

The immunization shots will be
administered in the Commons

Posvar maintained the service is
for “convenience” and is not a
University endorsement of the
controversial health measure.

“With our excellent health

HELENA, Mont. (AP)—The

campaign staff of Democratic Gov. V

Thomas Judge says the governor
didn’t go along with a latent appeal
by motorcycle stuntman Evel
Knievel to keep a fancy check
instead of cashing it.

The $1,000 check was a
contribution to Judge’s re-election
campaign. «

Election aide Evan Barrett said
Monday that Knievel’s check was
in glossy gold, bore the picture of a
motorcycle and. carried a warning
that it was not valid for more than
$10,000. .

On an attached stub was an
appeal from Knievel to the
recipient to let the Butte-bom
showman’s accountant’s know if
the check will not be cashed. The
message asks that the stub be

fulfillment of a merger is one or two‘
years away because of necessary
preparation,” Posvar said.

The plan calls for the sharing of
hardware equipment while program
storage would remain at each
institution.

A separate study will determine
the need to refumish existing
campus computers, Posvar said.

, He also said rumors that claim the
merger between the two institutions
already has occured are false.

A report by Clifford C. Ham,
chairman of the Senate’s Organiza-
tion and Procedures Committee,
indicated a ﬁnal draft on Senate
by-law changes that clear the way
forforiﬁing a Faculty Assembly will
soon be made available to the
Senate.

The amendments, if approved by

.a two-thirds majority of _Senate
members, would make the Faculty
Assembly a sounding board for
faculty views on University-related
issues including tenure, academic
freedom and faculty beneﬁts.

In a status report, Richard H.
Pratt, ‘chairman of -the ‘Senate’s
-Budget Policies Committee, oom-
mented»-on the -University Plan, the
newly-printed document ‘that spells
out long-range ' goal-s of the

_-University. ‘ '

“'I.‘h‘e‘ document presents some

ﬁgures as to the .possible future of

the University until 1990,” he.-said. "

“The ﬁgures are -not '-to be taken
seriously (as meaning) that -this will
actually happen, ‘but they are
numbers one should keep in mind

when thinkingabout the Univer-
sity’s future.”

Pratt also indicated that .a report
is being conducted on last year’s
salary increments awarded to
faculty members in each school.

Faculty workload “models” that
demonstrate, in part, how faculty
portion time toward teaching,
research, and public service may be
explored this year by Pratt's
committee.

In a report by student Council
members, Patricia Grim, represen-
tative of the Graduate Student
Organization, indicated a free
University-wide publication will
report the availability of student
services to graduate students.

It also was disclosed at the
meeting that the Latin American
Studies Programs has received four
grants totaling $165,000, from the
Tinker Foundation, the Rockefellar
Foundation, the State Department
and the Ofﬁce of Education.

limitations treaties with the Soviet
Union.”

The current debate on the future
course of arms control policy in
America is now split into three
schools, Ranger said.

“There are the positivists who
believe in technical arms control‘,
the moderates like Nixon and Dr.
Kissenger, who believe in a
compromise between technical and
political arms control, and the
skeptics, who question the inten-
tions of the Soviet Union,” Ranger
said. 5

The Russians’ views on arms
control is different from all three in
the U.S., Ranger said.

Ranger said he sees no possi-
bility of a change in the American
course of arms control policy if

Jimmy Carter is elected President.

“At ﬁrst there would be a ﬂurry of
new arms control initiatives. But

‘Carter would soon ﬁnd it impos-

sible to reach a meaningful arms
control treaty and would fall back-

on the course of previous adminis- ’

Cross Your Fingers

A For the past three months none but the enlightened have noticed the
handwriting on the wall. They’ve_ said it would happen since last
September but the administration did little ‘to prevent or even delay a
crisis. So the Campus Police walked off the ]0b last Monday mght after
voting 38-0 to strike. _

"The University made a ﬁnal offer of a 78 cent per hour raise, Spread
out over three years, half the amount the Campus Police asked, and the
offer was rejected.

The University is acting surprised, and they really shouldn’t be. For
as the negotiations went into a tailspin, the union voices became louder

' and louder, threatening to walk out.

But the Pitt administration, albeit all the advance warning it had, was

H epared f thi strike. Supervisory personnel are
gftteifigtyingvfo coplfer all thegfeseift beats. This will work as well as Pitt’s

G attempts to avoid the yearly tuition hike.

‘ Police Chief Curt Graham said before the strike, rnllch to the 
of students that must fl-equeritthe streets after dark, that the campus is
much safer than it has been ‘in previous years._ . Now he gets to
double-check this data ﬁrsthand when he elects to Jon} the supervisory
personnel on the beats.

Even Resident Assistants are pulling extra duty, patrolling the
dormitory halls. Although this is abig help, it won’t change the security
overall situation. _ ' _

The police have not received much support in their struggle. 'Iheir
negotiation attempts were never taken very seriously, as evidenced the
time Pitt negotiator Tom Cherry walked out of an  negotiation
meeting. Furthermore, no new talks have been slated since the Monday
walkout. V

Other Pitt unions will vote today to  whether or not to honor the

' Campus Police picketline. A vote to do so would certainly shorten the

strike, since a campus lacking many vital services would speed the
administration along in showing their hand. Pitt’s muons should take
this into consideration when voting today. .

The current security situation cannot be blamed entirely on the police
walkout. Sure, the light of professionals, as opposed to blue collar
workers, to stage a walkout can be debated. It was an obstinate
administration, who were given a pledge by the Campus Pohoe not to
walkout as long as negotiations went smoothly. They d1_d not make the
most of this pledge and helped throw this campus into its unprotected
state. '

In their current contract, the Campus Police caimot seek binding.
arbitration when a strike occurs. The police can prevent an extended
strike next time, if they seek a binding arbitration clause in their next
contract. ~

But now, the next move is the University’ s, and it is not one to see if
they can call the police’ s bluff. No one can tell how long the police will sit
out" before giving in. Instead, the administration can demonstrate 
they are concerned with student interests, and police interests by being
the ones to re-oven the talks.

And they must do-this quickly. Forthe security situation is not
improving. The best preventative measure students can take to avoid
foul play is to cross their ﬁngers.

  Erasing A Contradiction

’ College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Dean Robert  advocated Q

investigation of Pitt's admission standards in last week's issue of the

One out of three CAS students on academic probation last yen
evidences Pitt's academic standards surpass the capabilities of these
ill-prepared students.

Jennikins on. the administration

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The role of administration in the
University has been a matter of

. serious concern in the last two years

or so. It was one of the big

campaign issues during the faculty '

union election last year, and to some
extent it still remains a good topic
for raising blood pressures. ,

Desperate students have been
known to try and assassinate
difficult professors by repeatedly
mentioning it, thereby hoping to
conjure a stroke. pp

What exactly a university admin-
istration ought to do has been a
bone of contention in a particularly
nasty, roach-happy bar on the edges
of the campus. One voice (as

- usually) that has swelled and

whined over the others is the voice
of professor J ennikins, mulling over
the effect of the administration on
the happiness of those in the
Department.

The conversation had been
running on'about the use of drugs in
good old football, when someone
mentioned the word administration. if
Jennikins inhaled a bit of beer and
began choking. g

“Don’t talk to me about those

A Marxist 
Or Not
A Marxist?

After reading Dan Mulholland’s
recent article on Dr. Paul Nyden, I
am confused about Nyden’s po'li-'
tics. Either Mr.‘ Mulholland is
misinformed, or Dr.. Nyden is not a
Marxist. .If, as Dan stated, Paul
Nyden ‘claims support from the‘
Kremlin, then Nyden is not a
Marxist. If on the other hand,
Nyden is supported by certain
academics-in the Soviet Union, then
Mulholland is misinformed. One
can have friends in the Soviet Union
and not be in agreement with the
Soviet leadership. I think this point
must be clariﬁed.

Mulholland is clearly confused,

concerning the position of Trotsky-
ists (not Trotskyites)*vis-a-vis the
Soviet Union. Trotskyists condemn
the policies of the Soviet bureau-i

workers revolt and take control of
government and industry there will

molesters,” J ennikins said vehem-
ently. “If you want to see a tenured
man cry, just keep it up.”

As usual, after shutting everyone
else up, J ennikins swaggered into a
diatribe.

' “It used to be we faculty kept a

few administrators on a leash, U

conﬁned to things like collecting
tuition from deadbeats, or buying
paperclips. Those were the good
old days, believe me, when a faculty

member could tell a Vice-Chancel- _

lot to go suck wind, or anything else

' that came to mind. .

“You can still get away with it
now, of course, but there’s a feeling
around that it might not be the

‘wisest thing to do. Nowadays you

can’t even get an ofﬁce without
somebody somewhere ﬁguring out
the square footage you deserve.
Heaven help you if your chairman is
gutless. You could wind up in a
closet. V

Jennikins lit up one of his,tirly,
smelly, yellow cigarettes.

“_It used to be you didn’t worry
about money, or square footage.

"The faculty got whatever it wanted.

A faculty member had respect,” he
took a pensive snort of beer.

“Why I still remember the day
some sniveling» executive had the
gall to ask good old Sam
Lapperstien why he was running up
such large accountants with Central
Printing. Old'Sam was printing up
his own books, you know,‘ saved him
the trouble of a middle man like
Scribners.

A smile’ lit Jennikins face.

‘ ‘Sam took one look at that paper
shufﬂer and said .‘How DARE you
suggest this.’ How DARE you! ’ and
sure enough, that was the last time
that executive ever bothered him.
Should have seen that jerk
whimper. Heh Heh Heh.”

“What ever happened to Sam?”
the bartender asked, squeeking the

dirt around in a beer glass with a

grey-colored rag. ’

eyebrows knitted in puzzlement.
“Come to, think of it, old Doc

_ computer kept asking him to pay his

tuition or be kicked out of school... ’ ’

“Sounds like a purge to me,”
said the old Trotskyist from his
usual back-booth seat where he kept
an eye on the front door.

“Don’t be ridiculous, ’ ’ J ennikins
snapped, a rush of apprehension
cutting through his beery fog.
“They wouldn’t DARE try some-
thing like that. They wouldn’t
DARE...” ‘

J ennikins slipped out of his seat,
obviously in deep thought.

“Hold on'professor. You better
pay cash today. Your tab was
cancelled last week,” the bartender
said, deftly brushing a roach off the
bar. '

J ennikins jaw loosened, he gaped
like a grounded ﬁsh.

' voice, A

Agreement Needed Between

 Cas Values and Students

Contrary to the headlines in Monday’s Pitt News, I am not

recommending a “hard admissions policy” for CAS.

What I am

claiming that until the«

recommending, committed to the conviction that there ought to be a
close consonance between the nature of a.school’s student body and the
values of that school and concerned over the growing disparity between
the needs of the CAS student body and the priorities of the school, is that

‘CAS Council EITHER develop a more selective set of admissions criteria

(and accept the economic consequences) OR initiate a series of
fundamental changes in the curriculum, the facultyrewards system, the

» distribution of resources, and the rules and regulations.

Why Cheer
For lniury?

Saturday I was sitting in the stad-
ium watching the football game. It
was the first quarter and the Pitt
defense was on the ﬁeld. Suddenly
the whole student section was

cheering and clapping but I sat

there totally amazed. People were
cheering—-in fact elated—because
the Syracuse quarterback was still
lying on the field. There could only
have been three possible reasons
for the jubilee. First, the entire
student population at Pitt is a bunch
of sadists. (According to Webster
that means an “abnormal delight in
cruelty"). lt’s possible since people
seemed delighted with the injury.
Second possibility: everyone was so

was happening on the ﬁeld. Nah,
the people around me still had their
wits. Only if it had been the third or
fourth quarter would this be an
acceptable excuse. There could
only be one other reason. The fans
thought that Pitt needed to hurt the
Syracuse quarterback to win the
game. True. at that time the team
was in _a little trouble. But it is a
sad day for football when the 2nd
ranked team in the nation can win
only by injuring their opponent's
quarterback.

Now folks. Don't get me wrong. I
want Pitt to win just as much as
everyone else. I also enjoy watching
a hard-hitting football game. But
have people become so obsessed
with winning that another person's
life means nothing? When he was

knew the extent of the injury—it
could have been a concussion,
broken ribs, torn knee cartilage, a
sprained ankle, or he could have

ThankstY'all ,
For the Support

Thanks! Thanks to all the
students who came out in the cold
weather to cheer the #2 ranked team
in the country on to yet another
victory. It took a concentrated effort
on the part of the coaches, players,
cheerleaders and the band to get

things started but it really’ paid off. '

lt’s going to be a longeclimb to get
ranked up there with Michigan and

Notre Dame in spirit, but we can do‘

it. We definitely have the
capability, the enthusiasm, and
most importantly, the reason to
cheer-no one else has the #2 team in
the country.

Those students who missed the

game missed a lot more than the
cold weather and rain, they missed
the togetherness, excitement and
fun this university hasn’t seen’ in -a
long time. Sure, those who went to
the game have colds by now, but the
are the type of people that are
laughing in between their coughs
about how wet they got, how much
they drank, and how they’re ﬁnally
getting their voices back.

The people in the stands are a
very important factor in the game of
football. They have the power to
give the defense the extra
motivation they need to stop the

other team, or the power to give the '

offense the drive to make a very
crucial first down. Johnny Majors
and the Pitt Panthers have worked
hard to be #1 in the East, but the
best coaching and game strategy in
the world still needs the help and

support of the people in the stands. '
This team is the best since the ' '

'50’s and every student should be
proud to be a part of it. Each time

the players take the field they

represent every facet of this
University, V and the way they
perform reflects back on it. The

same goes for the students,

- This is nothing new, crime is a

part of everyday life, but the
amount of crime and rape that takes
place in the Oakland area is very
surprising.

The reason is that Oakland’s
means of existence is the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and surrounding
colleges and universities. These
institutions are thefocal point of the
crime and rape that goes on in
Oakland. If the Pitt administration,
with their own private security
system, and heavily manned police
forces, can’t secure University
grounds and buildings so that a
female student can attend class or
walk unmolested to different areas
of the university, then what purpose
do they serve? , ‘

The problem of solving Oakland
crime should not be the burden of
just the Campus Police (although
they try). But this doesn’t mean
that the Campus Police shouldn't
keep the campus as secure as home.

The Oakland residential area has
its’ own City Police precinct. The
role they should play in campus
security should be investigated.

They can always be seen on
Forbes Avenue’s business district,
from one lighted corner to the next
bright street. If you’re lucky you
can even spot four ’or more
policemen with dogs in hand near
the closest carry-out shop.

But as you leave°the Oakland

business district and walk toward -

your home in the residential area,
_ you walk down dark, unlighted
streets which are occasionally
patrolled, and are the business
places of muggers and rapists.

Jaycee groups put forth a massive
effort’ to populate crumbling old

Generally, I prefer to do my own

years soaping windows and drap-

So, my friends Kelly and Terri set .

out with me to explore a haunted

While I was aware of the haunted

BYJBETSY NORMAN

Pittsburgh’s Alcohol and Drug
Rehabilitation (ADR) Center has
one of the most comprehensive
rehabilitation projects in the state,-.

according to Dennis Palkon,

Director of ADR’s Research and
Evaluation section. ‘ .
The ADR Center, which is located
-at 3530 Fleming ‘Avenue,‘offers a
variety of services to both alcoholics
and drug addicts," although the

Center is designed .mainly for

alcoholism treatment.

There are three main project
components for alcoholism treat-
ment. The ﬁrst is a 5 to 7 day
“detoxiﬁcation.” This was started

/in October 1974, Palicon said. The

patient spends a prescribed amount
of time in the Center’s‘ treatment
area, under, the care of doctors and
nurses, and is warned of the
dangers of alcohol and the effects of
alcoholism. ‘ ' ~

‘ ‘It looks like some leftovers from
the Chain Saw Massacre,” I
shivered.

Wielding a meat cleaver and a
hand saw, the ghoul moved closer.

“I need more bodies,” he
announced. “How about yours?”
He pointed the cleaver towards me.
I st_epped back onto the guide’s

in Alfred Hitch.cock’s classic
Psycho..

“Probably didn’t run fast

Terri observed.

Then we started up a winding set
of stairs. At the top was a gorilla,
idly peeling a banana. His cage
looked a bit flimsy but I ﬁgured
that as long as he was preoccupied
with eating, we could slip by him
with no trouble.

ATLANTA (AP)—-The longest
life
stretched into the wee hours today,
his electoral count over President
Ford inching toward victory.

lhe 52-year-old Democratic can-

‘ didate watched the returns in a 15th

tloor suite of Atlanta's Omni
International Hotel, awaiting the
moment he could announce in this
Southern capital that the first son of
Dixie since Reconstruction had won
the White House. .

Nearby, in the same downtown
complex, 25,000 supporters waited
for Carter to appear in‘the World
Congress Center—all the fire
marshal would allow inside. The
huge arena was filled to capacity at

— 9:15 p.m. Tuesday, and state police

estimated that another 10,000
clamored outside.

In hishotelroom, Carter switched
two television sets from one
network, to another, watching the
inexorable result of a gritty odyssey

that began _with some of the

‘electorate referring to him as

“Jimmy Who?" and calling him a
dreamer.

With him were his wife,
Rosalynn, children and daughters-
in-law, his sister, Ruth, and other
relatives. His sister. Gloria.

brother, Billy, and his mother
remained at home in Plains, Ga.

l-‘lying from his home at Plains,
Ua., to,Atlanta to wait out the
election, Carter, in high spirits and
good humor, appeared. so conﬁdent
of victory that he chatted with.
reporters about his plans for the

‘ transition period after the election.

‘With Fresh Material

_ BY PETE BUTCH

Nearly all comedy material can
be traced to an earlier inspiration,
an earlier performance, something
that made people laugh once.

But the Lackzoom Acidophilus
Comedy hour, who performed at
last weekend’s Lutheran University
Center’s coffeehouse, offers re-
freshing comedy, and not the kind

' that is obviously resurrected from

past comedy greats.

The company, consisting of Marc
Simon, Dean Mougianis, Joe
Coluccio, Phio Traﬁcan and Foley,
put on a routine spooﬁng late-night
television as, viewed by a child
staying up way past his bedtime.

There was the bit about the

cracks relevant to the Pittsburgh
audience.
material, nothing reminiscent of
George Carlin or other satirists of
the news media.

And of course, there was the late
movie after the news. This one

about a woman given birth to a A

camel. The performance ended
with sermonette routine, one of
those religious shows stations end
their day with. The host’s ﬁrst
guest was none other than the Pope
who was in Pittsburgh seeking
political asylum.

The Pope had a few friends on
also. Rabbi Ace Goldberg with a
style of

preaching, pushed his Holy Golden
Chicken Bullion. He taunted the
crowd with the cry, “Can I hear an
‘Oy vay’?”

The audience replied. “Ov vav!”

To which he replied, “Thank-
you, Moses!”

The. other guests, were the
Reverend Dow Jones and Sister
Butchie May.

The Lackzoom Acidophilus Com-
edy Hour Troupe has been
performing together for two years.

BY M. C. PILECKI

A few years ago a “starless,” 

relatively unheralded movie burst
upon the scene and, to the surprise
of a greatmany people, racked up
quite an impressive box ofﬁce.

The ﬂick then was American
Graffiti, a “little” ﬁlm that made it

big. .It was an understated look at
one day in the lives of a group of
young people in a small California
town in the early sixties. Personal
crises and a heavy dose of early rock
’n’ roll underscored the film, and
the professional performances by a
large group of young, predomin-
antly unknown actors impressed
critics and the public alike.

It inspired, among other .things, a
TV series, a spate of record albums’
and the now healthy careers of
several of its principals, among
them Richard‘ Dreyfuss, Candy
Clark, Ron Howard and MacKenzie
Phillips. American Graffiti was a
phenomenon. '

Lightning may have struck again.

Carwash takes a similar episodic
approach to one day in the lives of a
group of young people who spend
much of their time listening to rock
’n’ roll. But where Graffiti rambled,

all overla small town, Carwash..

focuses on the immediate conﬁnes
of the carwasharea. And where
Graffiti was a sort of idyllic look at

a_ time that seems even more,

pleasant in retrospect, Carwash is
about people who seem a little more
realistic than a wandering group of

“Crossing the Line" are so
haunting that one has to wonder
they are actually coming from a
human and not some unearthy

On “Winner/loser,” Winwood

when she's ignoring the pain of her
sick child.

The carwash crew is one of those
multi-ethnic gangs of diverse
“types” one always ﬁnds in . a
World War II foxhole movie, even
down to a snapping martinet. True,
it's_ a more modern mixture, with a
Maoist, a rather ﬂashy gay, an
American Indian, a black Muslim,
et al, but it’s still the same idea of
bringing together a variety of
cultures to show how they can-get.
along.

But even with the stereotypes, 4.

there are some very interesting
characters, like the narcissistic
cashier (Melanie Mayron) who
looks like a temptress for an’ old
sleazy “B” movie. And then
there's Franklyn Ajaye, often

overdoing his part as dashing T.C.,

but he still has the best scene in the
ﬁlm when he ﬁnally convinces the
lady of his dreams (Tracy Reed) that
her PrinceCharming is not going to
sweep her out of her greasy spoon
restaurant, so she may as well just
be satisﬁed with him.

Richard Pryor has a" similarly
overdone part as a smart-talking
religious type, but beneath the
burlesque there's a strong message
of exploitation that’s well stated.
That theme is even more eloquent in

the plight of a young hooker (Lauren ’
Jones) who spends most of the 3

movie trying to ﬁnd her old
boyfriend, while dodging the
cabdriver (Carlin) she stiffed on the
fare.

If there is any central character,
it’s probably Lonnie (Ivan Dixon,
the most distinguished actor of the
ﬁlm), an ex-con struggling to make
something better of a job that is just
slightly above demeaning. He’ps
without a doubt the strongest'ﬁgure
and Dixon even
manages to put across the ﬁnal
scene without too much hokum. It’s
a clash with militant Duane (Bill
Duke), who insists on being called
Abdullah, a mishmosh character
that the movie never does decide
how it wants to treat.

Carwash is arambling ﬁlm, often '
fun, never dull. 'l'here are some
good moments in it—like Antonio
Fargas as the draggiest fag ever
thrown on a screen not only carrying
it off, but coming up with‘the best

' line in the movie——and some scenes

“Manof Leo” is a high energy

‘ jazz-rock piece getting more intense

as it progresses. Besides DiMeola’s

some _'Motow;nish' female. back-

_concept album'in,year‘s.- It avoids

"becoming too drawn out like the
Moody Blues’ Nightsln White Satin
and picks up where the experimen-
tal _rock of Pink Floyd left off. .

Regarding the music on G0,

that stretch reality a little too far.
The Prof. Corey scene is just such
one of those items played more for
low laughs than to really get the
story going, but no matter.

Okay, so Carwash wavers be-
tween, predictable but funny

slapstick and honestly ‘amusing
realistic comedy. It’s not heavy on
the pathos, but it’s still “human”
enough to be called pleasant and
heartwarming, with no sex and no
violence—which makes it just right
for a hip family movie.

“Foreplay/Long Time” opens
with Scholz at a little Emerson,

The piece then slips into a
high-pitched bluesy rocker, done
up nicely with soaring guitar and
vocals. And here is yet another
Boston innovation: well-disci-

well. ~
“Rock And Roll Band” kicks off
side two, a “moving” autobio-

chugs along with some help from
Sib Hashian’s crisply produced
drums. Next is “Smokin’,’f a

“Hitch A Ride” follows as the

_ Panther tailback Tony Dorsett displays his ranking as the all-time
collegiate rushing leader and hopes Heisman Trophy voters deal him the
same ranking in their balloting to take place at the end of November.

BY STEVE SYBERT

' Now that Panther tailback Tony
Dorsett holds eight NCAA rushing
marks, you’dthink he has done it all
and cannot go any higher ‘in the
elusive realm of success.

Even with such records under his
belt as most career yards (5,447 and
counting), ' four 1,000-yard plus
season_s, two 1,500-yard "plus
seasons, most career rushing
attempts (965 and counting), the

I collegiate all-levels rushing mark

Wilson photo
(again still increasing) and most
yards by a freshman for a season
and a game, along with per game
average, Dorsett isn’t ﬁnished.

If he gains 100 yards or more in
his last three regular-season
games, Dorsett will tie Archie
Griffin for the most 100-yard plus
games in a season (11) and a career
(33). If Dorsett’ gets six more

' touchdowns, or two a game, he will

tie, then possibly go on to break,
Steve Owens’ record of 56 in a
career.

Still, the biggest prize of them all
has yet to come, though many feel it
is just a matter of time. The prize, of
course, is the Heisman Trophy, the
annual award given by the
Downtown Athletic Club of New
York City to the outstanding college
football player of the year, though it
is usually a ﬂashy running back or a
smooth operating quarterback that
takes the honor home.

Dorsett has already been and will
continue to be hit with a slew of

honors as‘ is usual with the leading ’

Heisman candidate and especially
for the guy deemed by many to be
the greatest running back in the
history of the college game.

One unusual honor already
bestowed upon Dorsett was his
chance to ride an elephant today in
the traditional Ringling Brothers
and Barnum Bailey Circuc Animal
Walk from the Circus‘ Train on
Liberty Avenue to the Civic Arena,
where the circus opens tomorrow.

The Heisman Trophy may be just

_ a little more prestigious and Dorsett
surely want to have it just as badly,
though he continually insists the
‘award comes second to his
responsibilities to the team.

, ‘ ‘I’m really not thinking too much
about the Heisman Trophy,”
said. “I really do want to win the
Heisman Trophy, but I just want the

’ chance to play on one of the greatest

football teams I’ve ever been on. I
want to play on an undefeated
football team—that’s my dream, a
national championship and an
undefeated season.

_ “Right now, my biggest concern
is going undefeated and to do what
l’ve been doing over the years and

‘continue as I have been and hope
my contention for the Heisman
Trophy takes care of itself_.’.’, _

    Hoopsters To Rebound 1

a BY JOHNFEYDO

Although most Pitt sports
enthusiasts are currently preoccu-
pied with the fortunes of the
Panther football squad, the thump-
ing sound of basketballs hitting the
hardwood can be heard nightly at
the Pitt Field House where head
basketball coach Tim Grgurich
welcomed fourteen varsity players
for the opening of practice October
15.

The_big question this year is: Can
the Panthers rebound from last
years’ disappointing 12-15 record
and regain status as one of the
nation’s top teams? A

The answer is. deﬁnitely yes,
accordingto Grgurich, now begin-

ning his second year at the helm of
the Panther roundball squad.
Despite losing ﬁve seniors from the
1975-76 edition, Grgurich believes
the most outstanding freshman
recruiting year in the school’s

,history will enable the Panthers to
be very competitive in Eastern
basketball this year. _

“Our goal is to win the

conference and a bid to the NCAA
tournament,” said Grgurich. “We
have three high school all-Ameri-
in 6-2 Sonny Lewis of
neighboring Schenley High, big
(6-ll) Ed Scheuermann from
Baldwin, and 6-8 Mike Rice, from
Jefferson High in Frederick,
Maryland.

“Sonny Lewis is an outstanding I’

'leaper (35” vertical leap) and a
tremendous all-around prospect.”
Grgurish continued. “We hope
Eddie Scheuermann can become
the dominant big man that we need.
and Michael Rice i_§ also an
outstanding: prospect as

   
  

.4 u" -‘.r .7‘-

tl. strong

Also joining the team this year is
David Washington, a 5-10‘ junior
college transfer from Gulf Coast
(Fla.) Junior College.

“David is afme ballhandler who

" should ﬁt in well with his quickness
_ and, ballhandling abilities,” the

coach said enthusiastically. _

. Will the, loss of the five
seniors-—Keith Starr (now playing
professionally —with __ the - Chicago
Bulls), Willie Kelly, Tom Richards,

Bob’ Schrewsbury, and Ralph

MéClelland—have an adverse ef-
fect on ‘the team?

“Sure we’ll miss those guys,”
Grgurich said, “But we have an

7 outstanding group of young men to

work with this year. It’s a young
team, admittedly ailittle short on

experience, but long on hustle and ‘

desire.” _

Although the Panthers’ schedule
was rated among the toughest in the
nation‘ in- 1975-76,. this season's
opponents look even more formid-
able. '~ .

Pitt is now a member of a
conference, the newly formed
Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball
League, informally known as the

, “East Indies." The league has two
.divisions, east and west, Pitt being
a member of the western sector -

along with arch-rivals Duquesne,
West Virginia, and Penn State. The
Panthers play each of these schools
twice, on a home and away basis,
and the members of the eastern
division—-Rutgers, ‘Villanova,
George Washington,’ and Massa-
ch_usetts—once each for a ten-game
conference schedule.

That sounds like a formidable

agenda, one might say, but who else
do the Panthers play? Well, how

about national powers Notr'e;Dame,- I    ~

Syracuse for starters? The former
three. were participants in last

year’s_NCAA tournament, which_

includes 32 of the nation’s finest
teams.‘ So, the schedule is one of
the toughest in the land.

Is there any chance the Panthers

. are in over their heads? “No way,’ ’

maintained Grgurich, “We feel we

can play with any team in the_

country.” A .

In addition to the regular season,
Pitt is participating in at least three
tournaments this season. They are

matched against Southern Illinois," a 1 .

team they defeated in the 1975
National Invitational Tournament,
in the ﬁrst round of the Pittsburgh
-Classic‘(formerly The Steel Bowl),

' to be played at the Civic Arena-

Friday and Saturday December 10
and  -On the second night, Pitt
will hopefully be in the champion-

Dorsett Nears Heisman Trophy  

Besides Dorsett’s many records,
his 1976 total of 1 .313 yards, highest
in the nation at present, should be
what carries him to the Heisman if
the voting is objective (which is very
doubtful) and the ballots are cast‘
based on this season's performance
and not the past (which is in
Dorsett’s favor anyhow).

Of course, as everyone knows,

Pitt News

Sports

Grifﬁn perhaps did not deserve to
win the award for the second
straight year in 1975, but did so
because he was, at the time, the
major college career rushing leader,
just as Dorsett is now. And Dorsett
even out-rushed Grifﬁn by 187
yards (1,544 to 1,357) last season.

In Dorsett’s ﬁrst year at Pitt, he
shattered the freshman rushing
mark with 1,586 yards or 264 yards
more then 1973 Heisman Trophy
winner John Cappelleti of Penn

‘ State.

Over 2,000 radio, television and
newspaper reporters across the
country will be casting their votes at
the end of November for the coveted
award. A winner should be‘
revealed by December 1st or 2nd
and will be honored at a dinner
December 9th. Right» now the
voters “are ” ‘reviewing “ Dorsett’s
accomplishments, probably in awe,
and also those of his chief
competition Ricky Bell of Southern
California, ‘

Dorsett came to Pitt as a
freshman in 1973 out of Hopewell
High School in Aliquippa, Pa. The
Panthers were" 1-10 the previous
year, the worst record ever in the

history of Pitt football and the low .

point of a starving football program
which could muster only'15 wins
from 1966» to"-"1971. under such
forgotten names as Dave Hart and
Carl DePascqua.

In 1976-29 wins and two bowl
games later—the _ Panthers are
among the top football teams in the _
nation where, based on the school’s
past history, they rightfully belong.
Pitt is_ presently _8-0,? ranked second
in both the AP and UPI polls, and is

in line for a major bowl invitation

and a shot at the school’s first 

national title since 1937.
To many observers of this

turn-around, Dorsett has been the [
key. “I think Tony deserves to win-
the Heisman because of what he has I

done over the past four years and

because he's the greatest back to '

ever play the game," said Dean
Billick, Pitt sports information
director. ‘ ‘I don't think there's ever-

, been a player in the history of.

college football to turn a program
around."

“I think that John Heisman, who

was a great coach at Georgia Tech, ‘

would be very proud if Tony Dorsett
were the Heisman winner at the end
of‘ the season," said Pitt coach
Johnny Majors, runnerup in the
1956 Heisman Trophy race to Notre
Dame's Paul Homung of Notre
Dame while playing for Tennessee.

“He is the deserving man,"-A‘
- Majors continued. “More so than

any player that I can? -remember
since l’ve been playing and
coaching in the college game."

But, perhaps Dorsett’s . biggest
pitch came last week from Bell, who
practically conceded the award.

“I would be very surprised if I
received the trophy,” Bell was
quoted in‘ the Pasadena (Calif.)
Star-News. “Tony will win it with
so many eastern voters in his own
back yard. I'm not even worrying
about it." -

Bell's remarks came after he
suffered a hip pointer and mustered
only 68 yards two weeks ago against
Oregon State, and preceded
another lackluster performance of
74 yards last Saturday versus
California.

If Dorsett doesn't win the
Heisman Trophy this year, then
there can be no validity at all in the
award. But it would be a ﬁtting
climax to- the career of greatest
collegiate runner of all time.

    Boater Claims Soccer Future Bright

BYMARKMURPHY

When Leo Bemis set out to build
up the fortunes of his Pitt soccer
program he went looking for players
blessed with talent and bred in a
winning tradition. One of the ones

he found was Rick Roccon.
Roccon symbolizes the new look

' to Pitt soccer. As part of a bumper

crop of gifted freshmen and
sophomores, he knows he is part of
something special.

Melvin Bennett
Forced Out Of
Philly By Dr. 1

PHILADEPHIA (AP)-—The Phil-
adelphia 76ers announced Tuesday
they have .traded forward Mel
Bennett to the Indiana Pacers in
exchange for the Pacers’ number
one National Basketball Association
draft choice in 1980.

The 21-year-old Bennett played
one year of collegiate basketball at
the University of Pittsburgh before
signing with the Virginia Squires of
the American Basketball Associa-
tion. Bennett, 6-foot-7, played with
the Squires last year, averaging
12.1 points per game.

He was drafted by the 76ers last
year during a mid-season draft ‘of
ABA talent by NBA teams and was
considered a top prospect'before
suffering ~ eye trouble in trainig
camp.

Bennett was placed on the injured
list by the 76ers. Philadelphia's
recent acquisition of Julius Erving

made Bennett expendable.

“We have some real good talent
here,” Roccon said. “It is just a
matter of putting it all together.
When we do, and I know we will, we
can be one of the best teams in the
East.” '

Roccon knows what it is like to be
part of a winning soccer team.
Playing for Trinity High School in
Washington, Pa., his team took the
Western Pennsylvania title his

junior year then came back to
capture third place in the state his
ﬁnal season.

. “I came to Pitt because I wanted
to go to law school and Pitt has _a
good onie, " Roccon explained. “We
play a great schedule here too. It is
also close to my home so my parents
can watch me play and that means a
lot to me.”

Being a freshman, Roccon had

.trouble adjusting to the college

game but thinks he has ﬁnally
turned the corner.

“I had trouble changing over to
the college style,” he said. “It is a
lot more physical than in high
school. I have been getting hit a
great deal. I usually don’t get hurt
but this year I have had some
injuries. ' '

“My biggest problem this year
has been conﬁdence. I knew when I '
came here I would get a fair shake
but I didn’t know I would start. I
was a leader in high school but now
have to start at the bottom again.
Some of my conﬁdence was,lost
early in the year but I think I have
broken the ice.”

Roccon was a big scorer in high
school (he tallied 19 goals his senior
year) and admits to feeling pressure
here over not scoring as much.

f‘There is a lot of pressure on me
to score and I .. feel badly

sometimes,” he said. “Our
defense has played some great
games and I wish I could score for
them. I have three goals which is
more than anyone else but it is still
low. All of them were important
though and that makes it better.”

Roccon knows the future of Pitt
soccer is bright.‘ He also knows it
will take some time to put it all
together.

“We don’t have total conﬁdence
in each other yet,” he said. “We
are all ﬂifferent kinds of kids _with
different backgrounds.‘ We’ll play
together this winter and summer
and then maybe we will start to
click. We play really good teams
and we are really young and it is

hard. But if we get a few more good
players we are going to be really
tough.

Tickets are now available for the
1976 Pittsburgh Basketball Classic,
formerly known as the Steel Bowl,
to be held at the Civic Arena
December 10 and 11. Squaring off
on opening night will-be Duquesne
and Hofstra in the ﬁrst’ game while
Pitt meets Southern Illinois in the
nightcap. The winners and losers
will face each other Saturday night.
Game times on both nights will be ,7
p.m. and 9 p.m. .

Tickets are $1.25, for students,
$5.50 and $4.00 for reserved seats
and $2.25 for general admission.
Checks can be made out to the
Dapper Dan Pittsburgh Classic and
sent with a self-addressed, stamped
envelope to Dapper Dan Pittsburgh
Classic, 50 Blvd. of the Allies,

that.

‘as physical strain,
, harriers Becky Falck and Brenda

Pittsburgh, Pa. 15222.

‘ ‘I can’t help but feel sorry for the
seniors. It is sad they are leaving
because we can have a really good

team soon. It won’t be because we

have superstars or anything like
All of the guys have good
attitudes. I can’t wait.”

Although the Panthers have met
some rough competition this
season, Roccon still feels the team

. can play with anybody.

‘ ‘It will take a total team effort. If
all eleven guys play together we can
beat anybody. The teams we played
this year haven’t phased me that
much. I think by the time I am
ﬁnished here we can be nationally
ranked. It is not an impossible
dream if we put our minds to it.”

If Leo Bemis can come up with‘
some more recruits like the ones he
has picked up lately, Rick Roccon’s
dream will be a very hard reality.

Runners Falck,‘ Chorpenning

Place Well In In vitationals

BY 1_VIARlA SCIULLQ
Running two cross-country meets
in two days is quite a mental as well
but women

Chorpenning accomplished this feat
last weekend by competing in the
Eastern Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletes for Women champ-
ionship. and John F. Kennedy
Memorial three-mile run.

The SUNY campus at Albany

. provided the setting as Falck (17:53)

ﬁnished ninth in a ﬁeld of over 160
competitors onSaturday. Chorpen-
ning’s time of 20 minutes "was good
enough _for 57th place.

As expected, Penn State took

advantage of the picturesque, ﬂat E

"course by winning ﬁve of the top ten
spots. Kathy Mills, edged out

teammate Kris Bankes to win the
title in 17:10.1. From then on, the
Lady Lions fmished third, ﬁfth and
eighth to win the team title handily.
Next month, the PSU runners move
on to the Nationals at Wisconsin,
where Iowa could challenge the
Eastemers for the national crown.
Sunday’s JFK meet at Schenley
Park was a different story,
weather—wise. Continuous rainfall,
combined with cold winds, made
the going’ difﬁcult, yet Falck still

placed third. The course, described.

by one Pitt runner as “super-mud-
dy,” was to the liking of defending
champion Shannon Cline of Sioto,’
Ohio.» This year, she won the JFK
contest in 19:35. 1

Karen Cerutti and Chorpenning

Conditioned Icers Openi

BY STEVE SYBERT

With all but one of its top
goal-getters returning, along with
the starting goalie, the Pitt Hockey
Club opens its ﬁfth season next
Tuesday night against Camegie-
Mellon at the Civic Arena in what
Head Coach Len Barcalow calls the
best condition he has ever seen.

The Panther skaters began
two-a-week workouts four weeks
ago, turning relatively loose,
informal practices of the past into

Returning is top goalscorer,
senior defenseman Rick Vernon,
who has lit the red light 135 times in
three years at Pitt, in addition to
amassing 79 assists. Compared to
previous seasons, Vernon was held
down in 1975-76, recording a
26-9-35 slate, but seeing far less
action.

“There’s no comparing him,”
Barcalow stressed. “Rick is the

team leader. He knows what to do
with the puck and that’s put it in the
net.

99

   

The defense will be shored up by
veteran Bob Arturo, along with Bob
Stein and brother Rick Stein, who
round out the ﬁve defensemen
currently in Barcalow’s plans.
Marty Bradley will be Newill’s
back-up in the nets.

“We’ve still got a top-dollar
team,” said Barcalow. “It’s just a
matter of turning the gas on. They
know what they’re doing out there
and we’re going to go. We’re going
to be presentable and we’ll have a
good record.”

ACCOMODATE

convictions would not allow him to
work on Saturdays. Justice John
Paul Stevens took no part in the
court's deliberations.

automatically upholds the ruling of
a lower court. In this case, the 6th

that the Parker Seal Co. was guilty

of religious discrimination.
