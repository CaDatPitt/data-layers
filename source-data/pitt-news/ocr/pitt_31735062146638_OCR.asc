  ‘ZSIGMUND 'SPAETHl’S;   TALK ozv
  MUSIC PROVES WORTH WHILE

By MARIE EWING
Students who are not above going
-to assemblies were amply repaid last

Spaeth talk on “The Common Sense
of Music.” “Talk” does not do the
man justice. For besides opinions on
modern musical appreciation, bits of
musical history, and stories about
musical people, Spaeth illustrated on
the piano and even burst. into song,
a proceeding for which, it must be
added, he apologized. (We could not
seethe need of the apology, except
for the laryngitis of which the man
complained; we have heard lots worse
singing which was unaccompanied by
a ghost of an apology.) The assem-
bly was sparsely attended, as usual.

According to Dr. Spaeth, every-
body has a sense for music. Every-
body responds to; the spell of rhythm
and melody. And to prove how sim-
ple -is melody, Dr. Spaeth showed the
simplicity of musical “patterns,”

from two simple notes to the com-
-plications-of ﬁve’ different tones. He
Illustrated by such tunes as “Japa-

‘ er not only knows his subject, but

“Over There,” to say nothing of Bee-
thoven’s C Minor Symphony and
~Rachmaninoff’s C Minor Prelude.
Spaeth concludedjwiththe Rachmani-
noff on an Ampico Recording piano.

If the audience was small, it was
at, least appreciative. For the speak-

understands how to present it.
Spaeth, suffering from a slight at-
tack of laryngitis, was forced to use
an ampliﬁer for greater comfort in
speaking. The precaution was not
necessary, however, for the student
-body, or that‘ part -of it that had
strayed into the Soldiers’ Memorial
hall, were ‘quiet as the ‘proverbial
‘mouse. Real enjoymentpof the in-
formation and genuine appreciation
of the easy humor was plain-—wit-
ness the spontaneous applause that
followed the story about the prank-
playing nephew of Mendelssohn.
While the piano was playing the Pre-
lude in C Sharp Minorpthe hallwas
perfectly still. »

The ﬁrst Pitt-Oxford‘ meet was
held in October, 1924, when a crowded
Carnegie‘Music hall heard a split-
team debate. The appearance of
Malcolm Macdonald, son of the for-
mer British prime minister, marked
the debate.

tinguished members of Oxford Union.

lege in_1922 with a History scholar-
ship from Rugby, has been editor
of “Isis,” leading Oxford periodical,
and president of _Oxford Union so-
ciety.. His chief interest is in dra-
matics and he served as ‘president of

ciety last year. He has also played
many important "parts, including the
title role in “Hamlet” in 192-1.

A Boost For “Jinx” Scott

At the football names’ this past ‘

fall one of the big features was the

color stunts, etc., which were pulled .

off between halves. Notable among
these features were the memorial ex-
ercises‘ in honor of Walter Camp at

the Penn State game. Many alumni’ 
have written in commenting favora-

bly on these exercises, stating they

were as impressive as anything they‘

had ever seen. When the buglers at
the extreme ends of the stadium
it was very inspir-

be heard, other than the ticking. of
the telegraph instru_m'ents.A. *
The man who is primarily respon-

' sible for the engineering“ of all these

features was James H.

develop the cheering features- at the
stadium and is due a. speclalvote of
thanks on this account. It was he
who planned the arrangements for

the Walter Camp memorial exercises’

and hecertainly did a wondarfuljob.
Those who witnessed similar exer-

It is about timefor a- change to
be made in the distribution of news-
papers. The milling, pushing -thron
which each Wednesday ﬁlls Alumni
hall atthe lower stairs must elbow
its way into a ‘passage about four

by the circulation staff ‘for its invul-
-nerable position. _

Whilethe strong desire-on‘ the part
-of readersvto ‘secure copies of the
-“Weekly” at any cost speaks well
for its popularity, it is not at all con-
ducive to an even temper, and it has
a damaging effect on clothing. If
a student, on securing his copy, would
move aside and not block the halls,
some of -.j‘th'is« congestion would dis-
— appear. .-But since the students them-
selves refuse to do their share to-
ward relieving this condition, the
persons in charge of distribution

A’ .;Emory enry Debaie

;,  Qnly a small audience attended the
opening intercollegiate debate of the
season in_ Carnegie Lecture Hall
Thursda-y evening, where Pitt met
Emory and Henry college, of Emory,
Va., on the subject “This house de-
plores ‘the increasing emphasis be-
ing placed upon the practical in high-
er education.” Pitt upheld the af-
ﬁrmative. No decision was given.
Dr. Grover H. Alderman, dean Edu-
cation school, presided.

Abraham Fishkin and Richard

 

Murphy, members of the affirmative-

triangular team, represented Pitt,
while Carlton B. Hudgins and Law-
rence H. Hoover spoke for the south-
ern school. .

Arguing that “Life is more than a
meal ticket,” Fishkin opened the de-
bate for the home team and stated
that the bread and butter aspect of
subjects is being stressed too much
today. He stated that the present
relationship between the practical
and cultural subjects is wrong, _be-
cause it is producing the wrong kind
of man. ‘ ~ ,, '

Hudgins opened the Emory and
Henry case. In his soft southern
brogue he outlined the aim of high-
er education as being to develop “ca-
pacity to do work of the world not
only for a person’s own good but also
for the good of humanity.” He said
that the placing of emphasis on the
practice is the best means of secur-
ing. this goal, and that cultural bene-

"ﬁt. would be a by—product to the em-

phasis on the practical. ' A
. ¥'The policy of “cashing in on educa-

.-tion” was deplored by Richard Mur-

phy, who closed the affirmative. case.
‘He argued that we should not only
live, but also know why we live, and

that “mere existence is no justiﬁca-
jtion for living.”

Stating that “the parrot—like con-

“jugatiop of. languages” is now gone.

from our education system, Hoover

" closed the negative’s case.- “Empha-

sis on the practical has resulted in,
theenrichment of our curricula,
in a greater freedom .of electi_on of

“subjects, in humanization of educa-

tion, and in a general democratiza-
tion of education”, Hoover said.
Following rebuttal, an open forum

The joke’s on Cathedral Sidelights.
Only a couple weeks ago in this col-
umn, futuristic guesses were made as
tohowmuch noise the riveters were
going to make when they got started
on their end of the Cathedral work.
Someone has politely told us that
most of the welding wi=ll'be_ done with
electricity, in all probability. Of
course, this puts us off on our guess.

Another view to the distant future
is the picture of putting the beams
through the basement windows. The.
beams that will sppport the upper

As to how distant this is,

we do not know. '- _

The walls of the. Cathedral willf
vary in distance from the walls of
sheet steel pilings that are now on
the borders of the excavation. How-
ever, the Cathedral walls will aver-
age from the sheet steel about four
feet distance.‘ * *

A special drain will be constructed

around the lower walls.of the Ca-

thedral to insure dry basements. The
base of the drain will be lined with

Freshman Regulutione.

Shall freshmen

“They shall not!” is ‘the verdict
of the Student Council-. The ‘Council
hadpreviously stood behind reguls.-'
tions, but due to the lackqof "en-
forcement, and the general disagree-
ment among campus factions as to
the propriety of frosh. rules in the»

presented last week‘ for" considera-
tion. The student representative
group voted strongly in favor of con-
tinuing the rules. ‘ ' ‘ 

_ “The sophomore tribunal will be
discontinued for thetime being, but
will take a new form and will or-
ganize into an active body shortly,"
said Milton Saﬁer, president» of
senior court. “The proposed ‘frosh.
wreckingcrew is at present-in the
making,” he added. ,
.As soon as the new groups are
organized, the regulations will again
go intoforce. and the freshman class-

_The opinion of the frosh classin
general also seems favorable toward.
the rules. From thirty-five frosh ‘in-L

to the new regulations. ; -
“Any frosh would be a— fool not"to

“Some..ellows are ashamed of be‘-

“Excellent if everyone vconforms,”_
declared another. _- 
A prominent member of theclass,‘
however, voices the opinion thatffthe
rules are the bunk; who wants to
wear a dink ?” .  
In reference to the new dinks,
Charles R. Foster states that a"féw
styles are now under consideration.
and will no doubt‘-be on sale "at-“the
bookstore in two weeks. '“Tll€ caps
are designed for comfort and beauty,
and are not for the purpose of mak-

“Moreover,” he added, “I know" that

The -rumor that Carnegie Tech was
also considering abolishing their
frosh rules is unfounded, according
