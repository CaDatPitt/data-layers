O'Connor offered $177,200 to teach biology

state students by $220 and full-time,
out-of-state students by $484.

Students and faculty say they wonder
why the trustees deem the salary
promised to O’Connor appropriate in
light of Pitt’s current financial strug-
gles.

The salary included in the exit pack-
age is “about two-and-a-half times’
what I believe to be the average salary
of the biology professor,” said James
Holland, president of the University
Senate. “I just don’t see any justifica-
tion in the agreement — basically a
lifetime agreement -—. for that sizable
amount.

In-/ine skating: sport of the summer

By Linda

Asst. News Editor

The sport of in—line
skating has become so
popular that it is
becoming next to

impossible to walk .

down the street with-
out getting knocked
down by a speeding
passerby.

Now that the weath-
er is warm, it seems
like people are making
the most of their sum-
mer by moving their
fitness routine outside.

According to the
International In-Line
Skate Association,
these skates actually
became available
around 10 years ago.
However, it hasn’t
been until recently that
the sporting goods
retailers had trouble
keeping the shelves
stocked.

Bethel Park. “There’s .

“It’s more recre-
ational than jogging, — »
and you have more
fun doing it,” he said.

Dan Tomasino, the
manager of Koenig
Sports in Monroeville,
said that his customers
have taken a great
interest in the sport
this year.

“We deﬁnitely have
sold more this year,”
he said. “It’s an exer-
cise that doesn’t really
abuse your body like
running does,” he said.

“Also, the in-line
hockey is another
aspect of the sport,”
said Tomasino. “Sales
in hockey gear have
gone up as we .”

“It’s not a single
sport, it’s many
sports,” said Tom
Kahl, owner of
Outdoor Experience.
“That’s one of the rea-
sons it has become so
popular.”

“It has taken the
place of running and
biking for many peo-
ple because there is
less injury,” he said.

“People see how
easy they are to use,
and they want to get
involved,” he said.

He said the price of
in-line skates ranges
anywhere from $35 to

over $200, but you
only get what you pay
for. He said the base
price for a good skate
with good wheels and
good bearings is $139.

“Anything less than
$139, and the bearings
need replaced often,”
he said. .

However, not every-
one thinks this sport is

country now.

Pitt administrators are on
guard following a ruling by
the Supreme Court that may
threaten race—based scholar-
ships.

The Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals found the University
of Maryland’s Benjamin
Banneker scholarship to be
unconstitutional because it is
exclusively for African-
American students.

The Bannekerscholarship
provided approximately 30
students with a four-year edu-
cation at no cost. The
Supreme Court would not
comment on the decision.

This ruling could prevent
the recruitment of minority
students who cannot afford
college without an academic
scholarship.

“These scholarships are a
widespread effort to increase
diversity in job fields that
require a college education,
and to provide financial aid
for minority students,” said
Leon Haley, vice chancellor

for student and public affairs. '

Haley said the goal of these
scholarships is to provide
access for socially disadvan-
taged students who maintain a
strong work ethic.

Though this decision could
possibly affect scholarships
nationwide, no state or local
changes have been ordered.

Ken Service, director of
communications at Pitt, said

scholarships, but will do a

He’s talking about his
three children. No matter
what he does for them,
there is no time to celebrate
because there’s something
else to do the next hour
or day. He’s been raising
kids for 23 years, almost
half his life, and his
youngest son is almost
17, so they are not really
kids anymore. But that
hasn’t stopped him from try-
ing to deflect their pain unto
himself, to clean up their
messes, to fix all their prob-
lems.

Sometimes he wonders
if he does enough as a
father, and other times he
probably regrets doing too
much. The problems of
fatherhood.

The need and importance
of fathers is quickly
becoming a a heated issue
in American society, even
in politics as “family val-
ues” becomes a buzz-phrase

talking

 

for the 1996 presidential
elections.

Former Vice President
Dan Quayle questioned sin-
gle motherhood a few years
ago, and Vice President Al
Gore recently said it was
better for kids if parents
stuck through rough mar-
riages.

So, as Fathers’ Day
approaches, I am left'won-
dering what makes a good
father. I

I questioned the wife of
this father I know on what
makes him such a devoted
father. She replied that he
lives for his children. He has
no other life.

Once, his oldest son, at
the time a sophomore at Pitt,
developed an allergic
reaction to a strep throat
medicine and had to be
taken to Presbyterian
University Hospital in
the middle of the night. It
was not a life—threatening
situation, but by the next
morning his dad was in
Pittsburgh, flying in from
New York City as soon as he
heard.

I asked Leon Haley, Pitt’s
vice chancellor of public
and student affairs, who
could be considered 'a
“father figure” at this uni-
versity, about his father.

A major provider is how
Haley described his father.

The elder Haley never
missed a day of work in
50. years, and he taught
his sons how to be men.
Haley said he does the same
thing for his kids.

The father I know, the
one who says he’ll never
spike the ball, played a
similar role in his house-
hold. He even held down
two jobs at one point.

He spent his weekdays as.

a teacher in New York
City and his weekends as
a waiter at Howard
Johnson’s.

So providing for your fam-
ily, teaching and molding
your kids and just being
there — that’s what it takes
to be a good father. Maybe
you don’t have to do all
three, maybe one or two is
good enough. I guess there
really isn’t aclear cut defin-
ition of how to be a father,

no matter what Dan Quayle

or Al Gore say.

Sunday June 18, is
Fathers’ Day. Maybe instead
of giving your dad a tie or
toaster, you can tell him
what he means to you, what
he’s done for you. And
while, if you’ve read this far
I appreciate it, this column
wasn’t for you, it was for

Committee examines vitcil

By Christopher Lawrence
For The Pitt News

It takes a man and a woman to

make a baby, but a man must take an

extra step to become a father.

The University of Pi-ttsburgh’s
Fathers’ Working Group is a diverse
committee made up of representa-
tives of the university faculty, the
Office of Child Development, social
service agencies, concerned citizens
and fathers which is dedicated to
examining the issue of fatherhood in
Allegheny County.

“The Office of Child Development
often links the university community
to issues that are critical to families,
youth and children,” said Kathy
Rudy, a Pitt social worker and one of
the founders of the group, “and the
issue of fathers kept resurfacing on
many different levels.”

The Fathers’ Group recognizes that
fathers are necessary and make a
vital contribution to the healthy
development of children. “Being a
father is a lifelong process, and time,
commitment and responsibility are
major ingredients of fatherhood,”
Rudy said.

To that end, the Fathers’ Group’s
mission is to focus attention and col-
lective action on the behalf of fathers
in the areas of education, advocacy,

information and resource sharing, as
well as model program development.

“We’re looking at the positive
inclusion of males and fathers in the
lives of their children,” Rudy said.
“We want to strengthen children’s
lives by strengthening the family.”

The group wants to clarify the def-
inition of what a father is, said Phil
Washington, a social service consul-
tant and member of the Fathers’
Group. “How a young person deals
with authority has a lot to do with
fathers. A fatherihelps define rela-
tionships. He teaches young men
how to be men.”

Since the Industrial Revolution,
men have been leaving the household
to earn a living. According to
Washington, a lot of the roles and
responsibilities that fathers had in
the house went with them traveling
out. They becamean outside agent
and mothers took more of the
responsibility in the overall raising
of the children.

Society perceives a father mainly
as a provider. There are a lotof
fathers who can’t be a breadwinner,
Rudy said, but they can provide a lot
of other kinds of very important
child care. Nurturing, participation,
support and involvement with the
children is equally as important as
the ability to financially provide for

3

role of fathers in the '90s

them.

“The financial support aspect of
the father has become over- empha-
sized,” Washington said. “We value
dollars and cents much more than we
do relationships.”

Helen Petracchi, a professor in
Pitt’s School of Social Work, has
studied fathers of children born» to
single adolescent mothers. She said
that the process of sending a monthly
paycheck can guarantee a child’s
financial support, but it can also fos-
ter resentments, driving the father
further away.

At present, the group is doing a
number of things to try to bring
fathers back into the picture. They
are working on a survey to identify
what needs fathers feel must be
addressed and on an advocacy state-

,ment that they hope to send out to

policy-makers in order to raise
awareness of the issue.

They are also compiling a list of
services that are available to fathers.
“Unfortunately,” Rudy said, “it’s a
short list.”

When it comes to children, many
programs are targeted toward moth-
ers. Often agencies and organizations
don’t nurture the participation of
fathers.

“We want to bring the idea of
fatherhood somewhere close to the

said.

The Fathers’ Group also plans to
do some educational training and is
looking into holding a conference for
fathers here in the fall.

The members have high hopes for
the group. They recognize that the
role of fathers in the ‘90s is different
than it has been at any other time and
say that society needs to adjust.

versity is using to describe the bud-
getary situation,” said the president of
the Graduate and Professional Student
Association, Mike—Frank Epitropoulos.

O’Connor couldn’t be reached for
comment.

O’Connor, who resigned after losing
the confidence of key trustees, will
receive $313,792 over a period of 17
months. That pay is based on his cur-
rent yearly salary of $221,500 and will

' cover a one-month vacation, a four-

month administrative leave and a one-
year sabbatical leave. The monthly pay
will cease if O’Connor leaves the uni-
versity prior to the end of that period.

On January 1, 1997, O’Connor may
enter the department of biological sci-
ences as a tenured professor at an annu-
al salary of $177,200 until the average
salary of professors in that department
climbs to that number. According to the
Dean’s Office of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, the current average salary
for professors of the natural sciences is
$69,247, $107,953 less than what
O’Connor’s will be.

“It is typical for top administrators

[to receive that kind of salary when
returning to the classroom],” said
Director of Communications Ken
Service. “It is commensurate with what
standard practice is in higher educa-
tion.”

“It’s outrageous,” Holland said. Some
members of the board of trustees base
these types of decisions on the mentali-
ty that their experience in large corpo-
rations has cultivated, he said.

“It’s the same mentality that has
CEOs in major corporations that are
forced out because of their performance
and then given huge terminal pays —— it
happens all the time in the industry,” he
said.

“It always seems silly, illogical and
contradictory when they do it in that
setting. When they do it in the universi-
ty, it really offends me.”

If O’Connor does return to the class-
room, he will carry with him a long list
of credentials. His teaching career
began in 1968 when he served as an
assistant professor of zoology until
1973, then as an associate professor of
biology until 1979 and as a professor of
developmental biology until 1987.

it’s good exercise,” she said.
“But it’s not as much of a novel-
ty as it used to be.”

Jason Stevens, a full-time
associate of Dick’;-s Sporting
Goods Store in Nortliway Mall,
said that the weather has a lot to
do with the increase of the sale
of in-line skates.

“It’s a great outdoor activity
now,” he said. “It’s not as stren-
uous as running.”

Stevens also believes that the
fact it has mu1ti—sport potential
has increased its popularity.

“A lot of people are getting
into the hockey aspect of it,” he
said. “Many hockey leagues are
forming all over town now.”

He also said that improve-
ments made on the skates have
changed the sport’s level of dif-
ﬁculty.

“A new, softer wheel has
made rollerblading easier and
more attractive,” he said.

Also, according to a recent
article in the summer issue of
Diet and Exercise Magazine, a
new skate is available at many
sporting goods retailers that will
also make using the skates easi-
er for those who are still debat-
ing as to whether or not the
sport is for them.

The article stated that a new
unisex Genesis Integrated Toe-
Stop Skate made by Seneca
Sports sells at the suggested
retail price of $89.99 and will
make stopping while on in-line

quotes that the skates have “a
built-in toe brake for easy and
natural stopping.”

So, if you’re thinking of giv-
ing this sport a chance, just
remember that the International
In—Line Skate Association
suggests thatyou buy a pair
that offers a snug fit, yet
gives you enough room to

Also, the association suggests
that you get into a good habit of
checking your skates thorough-
ly before putting them on. And
always remember to wear your

Scholarships

self—examination if needed to
prevent future problems.
’ “In light of the Maryland sit-
uation, we need to look at what
programs we have in the event
of any repercussions,” said
Service.

Pitt has approximately 10
minority based scholarships
available. Funds for these
come from donations and mon-
etary gifts, and only a small
amount of university funds are
allocated to these programs.

The University of Pittsburgh
maintains one of the highest
percentages of minority stu-
dents. A study by the
American Association of
Universities ranks Pitt’s diver-
sity as seventh in the nation,
with 10.4 percent of students
being minorities.

In a local comparison, 8.8
percent of Penn State main
campus students come from a
minority background.

Haley said the considerations
for Pitt African-American

scholarship programs are very
demanding and in no way
should be considered a hand-
out based strictly on race.

The Helen Faison
Scholarship at Pitt is annually
offered to five African-
American CAS students. This
program pays up to four years
tuition, room and board as long
as the recipient maintains a 3.0
average.

A Challenge Scholarship is
also awarded to over 40
African- American students
annually in the amount of
$1,000. In addition, these stu-
dents can receive grants and
other non—university scholar-
ships.

Haley says that these pro-
grams are justified by real fac-
tors such as social “environ-
ments and historic discrimina-
tion.

“By affording students these
opportunities, we allow them
access to integrate with the rest
of the world. This integration
is a long—terrn solution to racial

barriers and prejudice,” said
Haley.

These scholarships are also a

valuable recruiting tool for
minorities. In 1979, when the
University of Maryland started
the Banneker program, 4 per-
cent of its graduates were
African- American. In 1994,
the number more than doubled
to 9 percent.
Mia Marbury, a Maryland resi-
dent who attends Pitt on a
minority scholarship, said she
was mad about the ruling.

“There is more money avail-
able for males though pro-
grams like athletic scholar-
ships. If they remove academic

  

ILE rsro LENSES

scholarships (like the
Banneker), it will leave some
of us out in the cold,” said
Marbury.

Some students support the
ruling that scholarships like the
Banneker are discriminatory.

“I think that they should con-
sider need, performance and
qualifications without using
race as an issue,” said Kim
Kuziar, a CAS student. “It is
prejudice to give someone
money just on race.”

Kuziar said that she under-
stood why these scholarships
exist, but said any hard-work-
ing person that can’t afford
school should be taken into

consideration without race as
an issue.

Haley said the court’s ruling
limits access to higher educa-
tion. “Permitting students that
have proven a need for assis-
tance to enter our community
contributes to the breakdown
of barriers,” he said.

Tony Dorsett Jr., a Pitt
undergraduate student, said the
Maryland decision makes him
mad because there are many
students who can’t go to col-
lege without programs like the
Banneker.

“Any time you take a schol-
arship away from a student, it’s
bad,” said Dorsett.

Opinions

Aclock for the lawn?

When J. Dennis O’Connor resigns his post as Chancellor on
Aug. 1, he will safely parachute to financial security with a
$313,792 severance package that includes payment for a one-
month vacation, a four-month administrative leave and a one-
year sabbatical, all of which will take place after O’Connor
resigns. O’Connor and his family will also be allowed to main-
tain residence in the president’s mansion until December 31 of
this year at the full expense of the university. ’

Capping off O’Connor’s little windfall is the fact that if he
remains with Pitt until January 1997, he will become a full pro-
fessor of biology in the natural sciences department. This post
will bring O’Connor another $177,200 annually. Also, while

‘ still paying O’Connor, Pitt will have to pay an interim chancel-

lor until the position can be permanently filled. -

If all this seems a bit excessive for someone who was asked to
resign from the chancellor’s office because he was deemed inept
by the board of trustees, you’re damn right it is. The month-long
negotiations between O’Connor and the board prior to last
week’s announcement of the early resignation led some people
to believe that the board of trustees had an honest desire to pro-
tect and further the interests of the university. The full disclosure
of O’Connor’s future at this university, however, makes that
belief questionable at best. It also suggests some strange negoti-
ating tactics, similar to an under—the-table book—making ring.

While O’Connor (a former biology professor at UCLA) cer-
tainly might be qualified for the position he will take. in 1997,
one has to wonder what makes him so special that he deserves
over $100,000 more than the average salary of other professors
in the same department. Pitt’s department of natural sciences is
highly respected, and the professors who teach there now only
draw an average salary of about $70,000.

It is amazing that the man Pitt was so anxious to be rid of is
now determined to be worth an estimated $500,000 by the end
of 1997. O’Connor can hardly befaulted for taking advantage of
the opportunity dropped in his lap (should he choose to remain
at Pitt to teach). The board of trustees, however, deserves far
more blame. After failing to support O’Connor for much of the
last few months, the board mysteriously decided that O’Connor

‘is nowworth half a million dollars to this university.

A bit unusual, don’t you think?

At a time when the university has had to institute a hiring
freeze, cancel scheduled raises in salaries and -face ever-increas-
ing tuition and declining enrollment, the board of trustees made
a horrible business decision in its treatment of the O’Connor
issue.

The money O’Connor will earn if he chooses to teach here
could be more wisely invested in any number of things. The lib-
eral arts department is sorely in need of more faculty. More
computers for student use could be purchased. We could get that
new gazebo on the William Pitt Union lawn, or even another
ugly yellow sculpture for Forbes Quad. Or perhaps another
clock for the Cathedral lawn.

\,.1i.\gc\-t ov me ‘two Has Mote BUGS N -me SYSTGM?


4 ' l a
BO5N‘,g‘l'ioN.s

 

I would like to
offer my sincer-
est congratula-
 tions to‘ Kerry

Ann George, this
year’s Valedicto-
rian of Peters
Township High

Columnistschooi. These

accolades are not
simply because
she graduated
first in her class, but because she
had the courage to stand up for
what she believes in.

If you have not heard about
this controversy over the past
week, Peters Township was
involved in a legal debate over
whether a formal prayer should
or could be offered at the
school’s 1995 graduation cere-
mony. The American Civil
Liberties Union, on behalf of a
mother only identified as “Jane
Doe,” filed suit against the
school because of the invocation
and benediction scheduled to be
read at last Saturday’s graduation
ceremony. The group contended
that the prayers were a violation
of separation between church
and state and were therefore
unconstitutional. 8

Late last Friday night, the
ACLU and Peters Township
school board came to an agree-
ment which officially removed
the invocation and benediction
from the ceremony’s schedule.
The school was doing its best to
avoid an allegedly unconstitu-
tional ‘act, maintaining
church/state separation.

The First Amendment can be a
quirky thing, and indeed can
raise some controversial issues.

Erika
Kendra

‘ The text states: “Congress shall

make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or pro-
hibiting the free exercise thereof
...” Nowhere in the text of the
Constitution does a mandatory
separation between church and
state appear. In fact, that rule was
derived from a series of
Supreme Court rulings (see
Engel v. Vitale, 1962 and
Abington School Board v.

.. ...s??ll?f??I?Pz...l.9..6.3.l..‘§ll3j.°il, h¢ld.that. IV

prayer in school violated the
Establishment Clause noted
above. The Constitution itself
does not prohibit prayer any-
where, least of all in schools.
Only laws establishing a nation-
al, state—supported religion or
those prohibiting the free exer-
cise of any type of religion are
expressly forbid by the
Constitution.

In the instance of Peters
Township, the ACLU followed
the rationale of the Vitale and
Schempp rulings, erroneously
contending that church/state sep-
aration was a constitutional man-
date. Since many groups and
courts agree with this type of
false logic, the township school
board backed away from its
originally scheduled blessings.

Miss George, however, chose
to ignore the court order barring
the prayers from the ceremony.
In the beginning of her com-
mencement address, she asked
her fellow classmates to bow
their heads and join her in prayer
IF THEY CHOSE TO. No one
was forced to pray, and no
school official took part in the
prayer offering. The action was
solely that of individual citizens,
separate from the school admin-
istration. The prayer was met by
a standing ovation from the audi-
ence, and was joined by most of
the graduates.

According to the “Channel 11
News,” about 80 percent of the
class voted in favor of the
prayers. When asked to com-
ment on the prayer offered at the
ceremony, Doe stated, “School
prayer is not a majority rule. It’s
the law of the land.” Apparently
Doe, along with the ACLU,
needs to dust off her copy of the
“law of the land” and read it
again.

I am unsure where Doe got the
idea that school prayer is not a
majority rule. The last time I
checked, we still live under a
democratic (i.e. majority-ruled)
government. Remember, it
would only take a majority vote
to allow voluntary prayer to
"."rF.*.‘.F.‘.‘l<.?.$C...h.°°1S-

Congrats to Peters Township

After all was said and prayed,
the ACLU demanded a video
tape of the ceremony and is cur-
rently considering action against
the four students involved in
leading the prayer, as well as
against the school board for not
stopping the prayer. I am a bit
shocked, however, that the
ACLU (that ever vigilant
guardian of all freedoms) forgot
about one of the other clauses of
the First Amendment, freedom
of speech. Miss George merely
exercised her First Amendment
right in reciting the prayer.
Perhaps if she would have
denounced Christianity or
espoused some other liberal
belief, the ACLU would be
defending her instead of chastis-
ing her.

But no. Miss George stands

accused of violating a fallacy.
Meanwhile, two actual parts of
the Constitution stand threat-
ened. If Miss George would
have been stopped, the Free
Exercise and Free Speech
Clauses would have both been
violated. Continued action in this
case would result in a battle over
which takes precedence --
church/state separation or free-
dom of speech.

While I am not naive enough

to believe that the school’s
administration did not know of
George’s plans, it is clear that no
official state action caused the
prayers to be read at the gradua-
tion ceremony. Therefore there is
no violation of any clause, even
if church/state separation were a
real entity. George and her fel-
low graduates took the initiative
to do what they believed was
right, and ‘for that they deserve
congratulations.
Erika Kendra asks the ACLU
why they chose to overlook Miss
George's freedom of speech in
order to guarantee atheism.

The Best Little Whorehouse
in Texas
Directed/Choreographed by
Ron Tassone

Watching the Pittsburgh
Playhouse Theater’s The
Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas, I kept thinkingithat this
had to be the only production

Liberty Ave. — with fleshier

Romeo and Juliet. TRSF’s
production featured costumes
described by the designer as
“unden/vear with a twist,” while
this work showcased under-
wear actually doing a twist
(sort of).

The story revolves around a
real Texas brothel known as
the Chicken Ranch that’s been
around as long as the oldest
profession, and its subsequent
shutdown. Miss Mona (Lenora
Nemetz) ran a clean little
“boarding house” full of fresh-
faced “sa|eswomen” quiet-like
for years until TV media hound
Watchdog (Joe Franze), remi-
niscent of Big Brother, expos-
es them to the nation, hinting
that they haven’t been shut-
down because of government
kickbacks (imagine that!) and
Mafia ties. The plot fools
around with the idea of who

Latimer

Latimer
World Domination

The recent flux of musical genres
makes distinction of any band’s partic-
ular sound  well, just about impossi-
ble. Which is why Latimer’s self—titled
second release might be so hard to
describe. Their 10—track World
Domination release is reminiscent of
Helmet and Nirvana. Overloaded
basslines, punchy drumming at
extreme tempos (warp speed and
lethargy) and either screechy or chant-
ing lyrics typify Latimer’s sound.

Picking up on the post-punk founda-
tion that has become so popular in the
last few years, Latimer doesn’t give a
listener anything to get too thrilled

 

about. Possibly because the sound
they key into is the mania that
spawned from the saintly Seattle and

the recently thrashed Oklahoma City-

“Stabs the Reason,” and “Hold Down,”
the third and eighth songs respective-
ly, are the voice of the saint himself
incarnate. The long, slow guitar riffs
and nasal vocals that break into puls-
ing refrains annoyingly echo Cobain’s
voice. (Maybe every young dark life
freak on the planet will fall in love with
this guy and he’ll commit suicide and
all these songs will become as mean-
ingful as the 10 commandments. Who
knows?)

But Latimer has some redeeming
qualities. The music fluctuates from
song to song; thankfully, we’re not
stuck listening to the Messiah every
song. “Stringbender” is particularly
haunting, with simple guitars, piano,
cymbals and lyrics. (Unfortunately, it’s
the shortest track on the CD) But
sadly, the remainder of the CD is grat-
ing enough to make one’s nerves fuzz
off.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say that
,Latimer doesn’t have anything to offer.
They may have something if they stay

away from the grating sound-that dom-
inates the first 90 percent of the CD.

Mobb Deep

The Infamous
RCA

The hip—hop world hasn’t seen a
thirsty young tag team act since Erik

Sermon’s nasal voice rolled with
Parrish Smith’s low baritones to form
EPMD almost a decade ago. The funk
is gone and the raps are more serious,
but finally there is a worthy heir of
EPMD’s two-man throne. And once
they are ascended, Mobb Deep will
have everyone forgetting about the
star—crossed Sermon and Smith.

-sound page 8

 

The Vox, Wednesday, June 14, 1995

 

 
 

“h'a‘gi'rnrm¢‘k"‘m“ Mobb
Deep’s game — just viscious
rhymes and back-to-the-basics
hard-hitting drum tracks.
Although it’s their second
effort, there's nothing sopho-
moric about the pair of.19-year
olds’ album, The Infamous.
Last summer Nas’ nationally
acclaimed explosion ///mat/‘c
put the Bridge back into
Queens, and this summer
Mobb Deep is making sure the
Queensbridge is a permanent
fixture in hip-hop. Deep and
Nas’ style are very similar,
that’s why it should be no sur-
prise that Nas’ guest appear-
ance on the album is nothing
less than a bomb. “An Eye For
A Eye,” with Raekwon the
Chef from Wu-Tang Clan and
Nas, features a basic high-
pitched piano riff and underly-
ing synthesized strings. Mix
that with a raw drum track and
a wicked, slow monotonous
flow, and ya got something
you’ll be listening to for a long
while. All four emcees rattle off
gritty, real stories without even
flinching for a breath. “Another
war story from a thirsty young
hustlerl won’t trust ya/ I rather
bust ya/ and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover." After
Havoc and Prodigy bust their
nut, it's Nas’ turn to tear it up,
as he delivers in a way only
Nas can — with a flow reminis-
cent of “New York State of

, Mind.”

Although Deep talks a ton

 

 

about death, don't get these
guys wrong. They’re not about
senseless murders and drive-
bys, they’re just trying to sur-
vive on the streets of New
York. Case and point, the
“Survival of the Fittest” chorus:
“We're living this till the day
that we die/ survival of the
fittest, only the strong survive.”
Like most of Deep’s tracks, the
bone-rattling drum tracks dom-
inate, as dreary piano riffs per-
fectly compliment the two’s
outrageously steady flow.
While most of Deep’s joints
have similar formats, none of it
gets old. In fact, it’s like a
Certs on a week's old stankin’
breath. With all the boomin’
bass, P-funk gangsta shit hit-
ting the stores lately, Deep
gives a pistol-whipping to the
industry, bringing rap to its
East Coast roots. But this time
around the lyrics are truthfully
hard and mentally Stimulating.
“Shook Ones Pt. II” is the
typical Deep track, just ampli-
fied exponentially. The lyrics
are real, too real. Havoc and
Prodigy get in your face, but
without raising their voices or
hands. ‘‘I’m only 19 but my
mind is older/ when things get
for real my warm heart turns
cold/when another nigger is
deceased another story gets
told getting closer to God in
a tight situation/ now, take
these words home and think
‘em through/ on the next
rhyme I write might be about
you.” Deep delivers so matter-
of-factly, so unphased — say-
ing this is reality, so deal with

 Deep’s rollin' o-deep EPAMD-style and following the path of Nas.
’ Mobb is. rolling two-Deep down

it. They’re not trying to give a
solution to the problem, nor
are they perpetuating the prob-
lem — they’re living the prob-
lem day by day. ,

The lone song Deep shifts
gears to the lighter side, well
kinda, is “Drink Away the
Pain.” The Song personifies
different types of liquor, all of
which were their tricks. Dealing
with abstract ideas likethis,
who else is better to have a
guest appearancethan The
Abstract, Q-Tip from Tribe
Called Quest? Although Q-Tip
goes off on a totally different
tangent, it still sounds good,
because after all, he could rap
an article from the Wall Street
Journal and still sound live.
The chorus ‘‘I think the whole
world is going insane/ I fill my
mind up with liquor and drink

away the pain” is laced with a
throaty saxophone and a mel-
low drum hook.

Havoc and Prodigy have
complete control on their plat-
inum-bound bomb. They pro-
duced all but three cuts, did all
the raps besides the few guest
appearances and ultimately

were the executive album pro-

ducers, and you can tell.

In their first effort as young
teens, Havoc and Prodigy
lacked the candy-coated mass
media appeal that the back-

ward clothes-wearing Kris

Kross had. But as they grew
older, wiser and notched a few
more war stories under their
belts, the duo is finally receiv-
ing the props they deserve
with their harsh street stories.
EPMD carved out the path,
Nas paved it, and now the

hip-hop’s streets with an
untouchable mentality

because after all, “man’s worst
enemy is fear.”

mixed with the
doldrums of
Columnist the lack of
Dave sports in a
Saliba world that

thrives on
only that which creates the
most revenue. Left only to
ponder, in the depths of a fit-
ness club three stories below
The Attic, three lethargic
weight lifters philosophize on
the thin and meek world of
sports.

-Taking an anti-feminist
approach: What has Pitt done
now? Oval Jayrfes, bound by
the ever-popular and now
‘politically correct NCAA, fol-
lowed Title IX, the NCAA
regulation. Roughly, this act
states that there must be an
even amount of scholarship
athletes for both men and
women. In more liberal and
correct terms, it is the Gender
Equity rule. Fair enough, it is
a noble and candid rule, but
women’s soccer? As if men’s
soccer wasn’t enough.

-One word describes the
Pittsburgh Pirates — talent-
less. There is no magic for-
mula nor is there any special
lineup that will bring them
wins. Only less—than-average
teams who play as good as the
Pirates on their best night is
theisolution to helping the
Buccos cling to the hope of
losing 99 games instead of
100.

-Two words, hyphenated.
Cal-State Fullerton. An unbe-
lievable team that steam
rolled through the College
World Series. Displaying
power at the plate and often
remarkable pitching, the
Titans showedthe true nature
of baseball. Fast action, lots
of action and no worries of
who would claim the MVP
royalties.

-The Steelers made the best
move in years by getting rid
of Barry Foster, a true zero
who seems to play only when
he deems it necessary. Fingers
have pointed at Bam Morris,
stating that his play last year
helped make the decision to
let Foster go to the Carolina
Panthers easier. Maybe, but
this dump off was inevitable.
His lazy mannerism and lack
of heart has caused him to
become just another could-
have-been. With potential
pouring out of his ears, this
mild—mannered, arrogant ball-
player finds himself in an
expansion organization, and

Miller back in lhe saddle for I100

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Four years after graduating, Pitt’s
all-time assist leader, Sean Miller,
will once again be gracing the Field
House floor with his skills.

This time, he will be dishing out
assists from the bench, somewhere he

seldom was during
his career here.

Miller, 26, is
back, after accept-
ing an assistant
coaching position
under Ralph
Willard.

“Pittsburgh has always been my
favorite place,” Miller said in a press
release. “I believe in what the staff is
doing and what it stands for. They
have already established an attitude, a
philosophy and an exciting style of
play that define Pitt basketball.”

Miller, a Beaver Falls native, is
replacing Tom Crean, who accepted
an assistant coaching position at
Michigan State. Crean came to Pitt
last year along with Willard from
Western Kentucky.

“lt’s unfortunate losing someone as
capable as Tom, but everybody is
excited Sean’s back,” said assistant
coach Sean Cleary. “Having played

here, he has an experience factor that,

nobody else has [on the staff].”

After his playing days were over,
Miller joined Stu Jackson’s coaching
staff at Wisconsin for a year. The past
two seasons, he was an assistant

coach at Miami of Ohio.
While at Pitt, Miller was an All-

Big East selection at point guard ii”: 
from 1987 to 1992, except for the i j .

1990-91 season when he was red-
shirted. He was Big East Freshman
of the Year in 1988. In his junior
year, he set the conference single-
season record for free throw percent-
age with .923. Miller’s lethal shoot-

ing extended beyond the arc, shoot- "

ing .416 from three-point range. His
assist record still stands at 744.

“We are very happy about Sean
joining our staff,” Willard said. “He
will be a great addition. We believe
he is one of the bright young coaches

in the country, "and the fact that he is

a University of Pittsburgh alumnus
and former player is an added
bonus.”

Miller will join Cleary and Bobby  H A

Jones on Willard’s staff.

BIG EAST NOTES: . -

Six Big East players have been
named to the 12-member U.S. team
for the World University games.
They are: Villanova’s Kerry Kittles;
Georgetown’s Allen Iverson, Othella

Ray Allen of Connecticut; and

Track's Angie Martin, on all-around performer

By Matt Grove
For The Pitt News

There comes a point in time
when every graduating high
school senior must begin to
ponder his or her future.
College? The military? The job
market? Maybe even the cir-
cus? (It has happened.) These

are just a few on the long list of
paths that the bright—eyed l7-
year-olds must choose from.
Unfortunately for some, the
first choice is not always the
best in the long run and they
must tum around and start from
scratch. This is not the case for
Lady Panther Angie Martin. In
fact, the road has proved posi-

Sports Information File Photo
Angie Martin, just a sophomore, played an integral role in

Dnnfknn nffnnlr {-'nr- hnfh I110   l\IIfl"l\l\I‘ fl‘Ql‘l( '13‘/'|l"l’IC

tive for Martin and it seems
like the best is yet to come.

Following her senior year at
Denbigh High School in
Newport News, Va., Martin
knew that shewanted to con-
tinue her track career.
Everyone knew that Martin
would be making headlines of
her own, but the question was
where? Like many, Martin felt
the urge to spread her wings
and leave home after gradua-
tion.

“I knew I wanted to get away
from home, but at the same
time I did not think of going
somewhere too far,” Martin
said.

Luckily for Pitt, a 470-mile
trip up Route 70 West was just
right for this prize recruit.

“I really liked Coach Lewis a
lot, especially the way he intro-
duced the entire program to me
when I visited. Pitt simply had
what I wanted,” said Martin.

So far she has returned the
favor to Lewis and the entire
program by bringing exactly
what the team needed to stay
on top.

Competing in everything
from the 400—meter hurdles to
the 5,000—meter run, Martin’s
broad range has allowed her to
become a large asset to both
the indoor and outdoor teams.

“Angie has the ability to
maximize anything she does at
any time, in any place and
under any circumstances,”
Lewis‘ said. “She surprised me

by not only being the top cross-
country runner, but she is also a
terror when it comes to
sprints.”

During this past outdoor sea-
son Martin took home numer-
ous honors, including three
first-place finishes. Two of
these came for Martin as a
member of the rnile-relay team.
The Lady Panthers were sec-
ond to none at the highly tout-
ed Penn Relays (3:41) and also
set a meet record at the Duke
Invitational (3:40.56). At the
ECAC Championships in May,
Martin qualified for the NCAA
Outdoor Championships in the
400-meter hurdles with a time
of 58.89.

As a true sophomore Martin
has already raced to numerous
titles in surprisingly diverse
areas. Already she has captured
the City of Pittsburgh Women’s
Cross Country Championship,
the Saint Francis Invitational,
and reached All-American sta-
tus in the half—mile. Notably,
Martin holds the school record
in the half-mile (2207.56).

“I love all areas of running,
but I have to say that the 400-
meter hurdles is my favorite,”
Martin said.

This coupled with her profi-
ciency in the distance events
definitely strikes fear in the
competition.

“As a sophomore, Angie is
truly a leader on our team, but
 the coach I can see that she

Kotsoy Ieocls Col State-
Fullerton to College

World Series title

Mark Kotsay, Cal State—Fullerton’s All-American slugger,
finished his season the same way it began — by leading his
team to victory.

Kotsay cranked two home runs and drove in five runs, as
the Titans knocked out Southern Cal, 11-5, to claim the
College World Series Championship last weekend.

The number-one seeded Titans became the first team to
win the championship while being ranked number one in the
country. Cal State-Fullerton (57-9) also became the first team
since 1950 to go through the regionals and CWS undefeated
(8-0).

USC coach Mike Gillespie was in awe of Kotsay, named
co-player of the year by Collegiate Baseball and the MVP of
the Series.

“Kotsay is the Messiah. If the baseball draft were held
today, he would be the number-one pick,” Gillespie said.

The sixth-seeded Trojans (49-21) held their own early in
the game, led by Ernie Diaz. He hit a three-run homer with
two down in the second inning, matching Kotsay, who did
the same in the Titan’s side of the first inning.

But the Titans soon pulled out of reach. They had 'a four-
run second inning, boosted by another home run from
Kotsay, his 20th of the season.

does it in different ways than others,” said
Lewis. “What she brings to the track is 100 per-
cent confidence that the job, whatever it may be,
will get done. She is a ﬁerce competitor during
meets and in practice. I laugh when I say to
other runners that when you go up against Angie
Martin, you better bring your lunch!”

What does the future hold for this emerging
star? Martin has high hopes for her career on the
track and off.

“After Pitt, I definitely plan on running some-
where, and hopefully it will be on a competitive
level, but we’ll have to wait and see when the
time comes,” said Martin.

Away from athletics, Martin is majoring in
clinical psychology.

“As of now I plan on going to graduate
school, and I see myself, wherever I may be,
working with people with various disorders,”
she said.

Since coming to Pitt she has proven that she
possesses the work ethic and confidence that
will take her any place she wishes to go.

“She simply does not settle for second-best in
anything. Whatever she does I know she will
succeed,” Lewis believes. “I have a strong sus-
picion that we will get a lot more all-around
from Angie Martin than anyone can even expect
from one single person.”

We will have to wait and see exactly where
this particular road takes her, but it is safe to say
that she will be leading the way.

“This school has the history, attitude and per-
sonality I look for,” Martin said. “Pitt has pro-
vided me the opportunity to do just what I want
to do.”

Pitt made a quality investment when they
signed Angie Martin, and many will be watch-
ing as she pays endless dividends on and off the
track. You can take that to the bank.

Foster. In what was supposed to be his
first day of practice at camp Panther,
head coach Dom Capers declared the
running back unfit to practice due to
not being physically conditioned.

°In anothermove that has left the
weight room in turmoil, placekicker
Gary Anderson of the Pittsburgh
Steelers is that no more. In his words,
“Too little, to late.” Or was it?
Anderson was hoping to get a contract

of $800,000, but the Steelers offered

him a number significantlyless than
that. Agreed, the meager $400,000 or
so that he would have gotten is below
what other kickers less talented than he
receive, but Anderson turned down the

$800,000 last year when he held out.
He is 36 years old. Even for a place-
kicker, that is still pretty old. He has
been with the Steelers for 13 seasons,
andmuch like the the Franco Harris
turmoil of the mid-eighties, he has now
become Gary Who?

-This past Saturday, Tommy
Morrison defeated Razor Ruddock in a
heavyweight fight. Morrison, in his
victory, captured some garbage-can
belt. Boxing is now in critical condi-
tion.

°Death in the boxing ring claimed
another fighter. Jimmy Garcia of
Columbia was knocked brain-dead over

the sport heightened, and the prospect
of instituting head gear crept up once
again. The fight world has always been
brutal and it will ‘always remain brutal.
For those of you who echo the voice of
banishment, it will never happen. The
color red that ﬂows in the ring is the
lesser of two gods. The river of green
ﬂows much quicker and thicker.

-It was almost a year ago that the
Houston Rockets won their NBA
Championship, splitting the network
ratings with O.J. Simpson and his free-
way escapade. One year later, and the
Rockets are at it again. This time their
foe is the Orlando Magic, and O.J. is
headlining in one of the most comical
and ridiculous courtroom dramas out-

side of “Days of Our Lives.” With a
win tonight, the Rockets would sweep
the series from the Magic, the first
team to do so since the Pistons swept
the Lakers in 1988.

-As a final thought, Pitt should look
into implementing a coed lifting team.
There would be gender equity, and with
the renovation of the Lothrop cafeteria,
now the Lothrop weight room, the team
would have two practice fields. Much
like the soccer teams and tennis teams,
revenue would not be a factor, but then
again, neither would expense. But best
of all, there would be no soccer.
