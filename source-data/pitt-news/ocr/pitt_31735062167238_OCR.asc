From the Oakland Ministry Center the canvassers were taken to
various spots throughout the city where they spent several hours knock-

Eugene McCarthy.

The canvassers reported upo-n their return that they found many

people throughout the city
anxious to talk about the Viet-
nam war an the crisis facinlg
the nation’-s cities this summer.
John Ruskay, director of Stu-
dents Activties .in Allegheny
County for Citiz-ens Ifor McCar-
thy, said that “At first, most of
u-s thought that people wouldn’t
even know McCarthy. We were
surprised. People all over Pitts.-
-burgh kn-ew of him and were
interested to learn more. After
the stunning victory in New
Hampshire, we found even
greater interest among people.”

At the time of publication the
‘Students for McCarthy-Kennedy
were still re-assessing their poli-
cies in light of President John-
son’s recent speech on Vietnam,
and his decision to run for re-
election. There will be a state-
ment on the Students for McCar-
thy—Kenedy in Friday’s issue of
the Prrr News.

In addition to obtaining sup-
port for Senator McCarthy in
the April 23 primary, the can-
vassers are also noting all sup-
porters of -Senator Kennedy.
Terry Greenlund, the director of
student canvassing, mentions
that “Senator Kennedy is not
on the ballot in Pennsylvania -so
we don't have to choose between
the two men.”

Although canvassing is an im-
pcrtiant part -of the McCarthy
campaign, there is a great deal
of other events taloing place at
the McCarthy ‘headquarters. The
-office at Fifth and Atwood was
open until after midnight every
evening last week. Over 500 stu-
dents are working -throughout
Allegheny County, in an effort
to «bring Eugene McCart:hy’s
campaign to the voters.

To augment the 1-ocal canvas-
sers, hundreds of students from
New York, Ohio, Virginia, Ten-
ne-ssee, and Wes.t Virginia will
descend upon Pittsburgh follow-
ing the Connecticut Primary, to
work full-time on the campaign.
Planning is already underway
to use these students to their
fullest potential. Marc Spiegell
and Harry Tuminello, both sen-
iors at the University, are work-
ing full time arranging housing
for the students. Jay Rosenstein,
Terry Hbman, and Elliott Zel-
dow, allso graduating seniors,
are laying out the areas that
will be canvassed by the Out Of
state students. These three men
are also preparing hundreds of

“Is the Draft Bugging You?”
Was the basis for a symposium
here recently. The symposium,
-o.rgan‘ize_d by a group of young
men called The Resistance, was

organized to inform the young
draft-age men just what alterna-
tives they had, when fa-ced with
the draft.

The symposium started off
with the question ,” What you
should do when confronted with
a 1-A clad-ssificati~on?” It was
brought out that most people

soon as they get their classiﬁ-

their right to a personal appear-

Morrison, one of the organizers
of the symposium,” for most of

Faculty React to Johnson’s Withdrawal

Zasloff, Glazer View LB] Move;
Respond With Opposing Remarks

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Two opposing views concerning President J ohnson’s Sunday night
speech were given by University faculty members, Dr. Joseph J . Zasloff
and Walter S. Glazer. Dr. Zasloff feels that the President has made a
“genuine offer of peace.” Glazer. on the other hand, doubts Mr. Johnson’s
sincerity and thinks that he has made “a shrewd political move.

These remarks were made in response to the speech that LBJ gave
in wh.ich he announced that he “would not seek or accept” his party's
nomination for his re-election. Earlier in his speech, Johnson also re-

vealed plans to de-escalate the present Vietnam war effort in response

conscientious db-
ject ion. He
pointed out that
the qualifica-
tions for one of
these defer-
ments are that
you must be op-
posed to war in
any form, you
must ébellieve -in
a supreme being,
and you cannot
believe in exist-
ing any type -of force any rea-
son. Deferments of this type
would not be given to la ‘per-
son for any -personal moral code
or belief.

The question of Canada was
also taken up in the conference.
“Anyone can legally leave the
United States, as long as he
leaves his new address within
ten day after his departure,
“one of the speakers pointed
out. It was also brought up.that
since Canada has no conscrip-
tion, a draft dodger cannot be
expedited and brought back to
the United States once he has
fled to Canada. But, once a dod-
ger returns to the U.S., even
though he has become a citizen
of Canada, he can be prosecuted
and arrested, for he still is a.
fugitive from ju.s't1'ce.

The last thing talked about
in this conference was the exact
process a young man would
have to go through in resisting
the draft. Speakers pointed out
that a m-an have his draft card
on him at all times upon penal-

‘ty of a fine of 10,000 dollars

and/or 15 years imprisonment.
When a person turns in his
draft card he commits a federal
offense, and consequently he
will receive a visit from the
FBI. They Wllll ask the person
if he has a statement, and when
he advisedly says no, the draft
board will take action. They
will send him a deliquency no-
tice or reclassify him as 1-A.
After his induction notice is re-
ceived, there is usually about
a month before he is arrested,

arraigned, and indicted.

to the mountain of criticism and dissent that has been heaped upon

‘him by the American public. All
bombings, he stated, would be

discontinued with the exception ‘

of the area north of the demil-
itarized zone. The President has
called for the Hanoi government
to join -him in a “series of mu-
tual moves toward peace.”

Dr. Zasl-off, associate profes-
sor of political science, was
“very impressed by Johnson’s
stan .” He believes, that “one
can take -hirn 0-at his word,” in
‘his desire for peace in Vietnam
and his withdrawal from the
Presidential race. Dr. Zasloff
feels that the presidential deci-
sion “will heal .some of the rift ‘in
the Democratic Party.” “On the
political side,” :he concluded,
“Johnson recognized that he was
unlikely to win” the Presidential
race.

An opposing iviewi was ex-.

pressed by Glazer, an American
-history teacher. “Johnson has
ended all debate on Vietnam and
has taken the wind out of the
arguments of his dissenters.” “I

ﬁnd this politically dangerous,”

Gal-azer said. “Johnson is trying
to look sincere to the general
public .in his efforts to de-es-
calate the war. It is quite clear
that Johnson’s terms will not
be -acceptable to Hanoi.” Glaz-
er added that after Hanoi has
rejected this treaty, they may
unleash an all out attack. Such
an attack, Glazer feels would
have to be met my a .re-escalation
of the war that would have the
support of public opinion in “a
possible desire for a formal dec-
laration of war.”

may need help -or are interest-

Closely related to Project Cal..-

which “motivates intelligent stu-

one of the Project Leap tutors.

One of the phases of the two
programs is a trip for the par-
ticipating students to two near-
by colleges. Saturday, in con-
junction with Sigma Chi frater-
nity and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
sorority, Project Campus and
Leap will sponsor a. trip to Slip-
pery Rock State College and
Grove City College. The trip‘ is
designed to acquaint the high
outside the Pittsburgh area in
an attempt to expose them to
school students with colleges

The students of the two proj-
ects, along with their parents
and a few of their college in-

   
 

structors, will leave the Student
Union -about 8:30 a.m. and trav-
cl to Slippery Rock where they
will tou.r the campus and hear

From there, t-hey will go to
Grove City College to eat lunch
and again tour the campus, stay-
ing until approximately 3:30

University.

Travalio stated that besides
tutoring and trips, college in-

Time of Confusion

For the past four years, the war in Vietnam has
been gradually escalated. Lately’, this escalation has
swelled to balloon like proportions. And with this
gradual escalation, our society_ has become increas-
ingly divided over the right course of action to pur-
sue in Vietnam. We have been witnesses to the never
ending cries for cessation of the bombing of the North
and we have heard the moralistic pleas for military
withdrawal. But now, President Johnson, by calling
for a halt in the bombing has silenced these cnoble
cries and has emerged as a statesman for an honor-
able peace in Vietnam.

It was last week that The Pitt News charged
that President Johnson was “the great divider of
American society.” Perhaps we were premature in
our judgement. But now we feel that the President
has finally heard the cries of dissent and has real-
ized these cries are mo longer gesticulations of splin-
ter groups.

The President can no longer be considered an
advocate of military escalation. Now he must be
viewed as a--proponent of political solution in Viet-
nam. The President has called for a political solution
in which “all the South Vietnamese” will be insured
a viable future.

It is this sort of new political climate that will
hopefully result in a negotiated settlement in Viet-

am

. pa‘ As lon%§ts- U.S. planes continue to bomb North

ailtii is his an agreement seems far
fetched. But if U.S. de-escalation is correspondingly
met by North Vietnamese de-escalation, the negotiated
settlement that all of us have hoped and prayed for,
could very well become a reality.

‘Even so, there is still a sense of skepticism hang-

ing in the air. So far, Hanoi has met the President's -

proclamation with an eerie silence. Yet, we must agree
with the New York Times by stating that “the possi-
bilities for negotiated settlement will never be better

. than they are now.”

On the international level of considerations, Mr.
J ohnso,n’s most essential proclamation was a halt of
the bombing of the North. On the national level Mr.
J ohnson’s decision not -to run opens up a door that
is now flooded with political considerations and con-
sequences.

These consequences and considerations, however,
are obscure until we determine the sincerity of J ohn-
son’s Sunday night gesture. Some critics say that the
President's dramatic decision is merely a political
ploy to insure his re-election. Others say, that they
cannot trust Mr. Johnson and therefore do not be-
lieve him. Many of these critics believe that -the Presi-
dent Iwrill, in fact, accept a draft.

As far as we can ascertain, the President was
quite sincere in his gesture. He did say that he would
neither “seek or accept” the democratic nomination.
He also said that his decision was irrevocable.

In this new period of partisan reconciliation,
which political candidate will forge ahead on the
river of politics‘? No longer can the peace candidates
lambast the Johnson Admini'stration. Senators Ken-
nedy and McCarthy will have to alter their positions
and platforms.

We now face a time of change and confusion.
There are three men now running for the Presidency
but there will doubtless be newly announced candi-
dancies in the future -and each new political person-
ality will add complexity to the Presidential race.
This is a time of watching and waiting; not a time of
predicting.

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

The apparent withdrawal of Lyndon Johnson
from Democratic Party politics has left the thou-
sands of students working for Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy in a frantic state of confusion.

Up until last Sunday, the issues were clear and
the choice was obvious. Doing everything from
massive canvassing to addressing envelopes, col-
lege students had been the impetus behind Mc-
Carthy’s campaigns in New Hampshire and Wis-
cousin. They were waging what was essentially an
anti-Johnson assault, trying to elect anti-Adminis-
tration delegates to the National Convention.

Now however, the common goal has been ab-
ruptly taken away. Many of the students working
for McCarthy would rather support Sen. Robert
Kennedy. Previously, their rationale was to rally
to McCarthy's cause as a means of stopping the
President’s renomination on the first ballot. After
that had occurred, the Convention would then pre-
sumably go with Kennedy.

BUT THAT LINE OF REASONING is no longer
valid. The political variables have multiplied as-
tronornically. For the students working for Mc-
Carthy in Pennsylvania, the problem is perhaps
the most acute.

The primary here is three weeks away. Mc-
Carthy’s name is the only one listed on the pref-
erence ballot. However, there are delegates to be
elected, either regular party people (previously
pro-Johnson) or the anti machine slate (pro-Mc-

Students Still for McCarthy’

O
\\\.\\\\\\\\\\\\\V

The question now is, whom do the students
work for‘? If Sen. Kennedy wins the open pri-
maries which follow in Indiana, Nebraska, Ore-
gon, and California, as the polls show he can, he’ll
have virtually assured himself the nomination. For
in that case, the “machine” Democrats, no longer
owing allegiance to President J ohnson, would swing
to Kennedy. Does that mean that Pennsylvania’s
regular party delegates should be supported? .

ON THE OTHER HAND, not all the students
prefer Kennedy. McCarthy has built up an enthusi-
astic group of supporters, who now believe that
they have the more attractive candidate. As one
of them pointed out, “Kennedy has his rabid sup-
porters, but he also has people who detest him.
No one hates Gene McCarthy.”

With that in mind, some students urge con-
tinued support of proMcCarthy delegates. They
also point out that you can never underestimate
LBJ as a politician. He could somehow achieve
fruitful negotiations in Vietnam between. now and
August and be renominated at the Convention by
regular party delegates.

Speculating further, it is not inconceivable that
the President could unload another bombshell on
the American people and support McCarthy against
Kennedy.

Thus one of the unfortunate results‘ of the
President's withdrawal is to confuse students’ per-
ception of their place in a campaign that was

Hubert Humphrey —

Where Does Loyalty Payoff?

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor
If a Democrat ever needed a
good Publicity Relations man, all
he had to do was call Vice-Pres-
ident. Hubert Horatio Humphrey.
Humphrey, a staunch Party
man, was the President’s best PR

‘man. He would go anywhere the

President asked, would do any-
thing the President asked, and
would support the President in
reelection if asked.

But today, Humphrey stands
as a man who was pick-pocketed
by his friend. The Johnson deci-
sion shocked the nation, and it
colored black the candidacy pic-
ture of Humphrey.

AS YET, Humphrey has not
chosen to be called a “candi-
date.” But that may be only a
matter of one day.

Nevertheless, several political
observers feel the hour is too
late for Humphrey to enter ef-
fectively the Presidential race.

They feel the President did not
give Humphrey enough time to
organize a campaign. They also
feel that Humphrey has been
tainted by J ohnson’s Vietnam and
domestic policies. ’

The disadvantages of being a
candidate are the price Hum-
phrey paid with loyalty to _the
‘Democrats. And the advantages,
however great in number, may
be lesser in importance.

RUNNING AGAINST the now
favorite Senator Robert F. Ken-
nedy, Humphrey must align his
political forces. Humphrey has
fewer enemies, Democrats and
Republicans, than Kennedy. He
would be preferred to Kennedy
in the South.

And of all the candidates, Hum-
phrey stands as the one man who

A could cement the many cracks of

the Democratic Party. He could
offer the most hope fo-r party
unity in August and November.

And too, consider the nation’s

Shocking Compromise -

labor leaders who seek an organ-
ization man. Before the shocker,
they had chosen Johnson, but
now Humphrey could be their

'man; union leaders appear un-

sympathetic towards Kennedy
and Senator Eugene McCarthy.

BUT T0 CONFUSE Humphrey’s
candidacy even more, listen to
this:

> Labor wants to back a win-
ner; presently the polls show
Kennedy leading the field.

> Humphrey could aid Ken-
nedy; the Vice President could
better direct the Kennedy enthu-
siasm and fire into policy. S

> Humphrey might even con-
sider being Ke1medy’s V.P.; only
1,320 delegates are needed for
the nomination at the convention,
and they might go for this.

Speculations could go on and
on, but if Humphrey decides to
become a Presidential candidate,
he better do it fast.

“I Will Not Seek, Not Accept . . .”

by MIKE BROURMAN

In one swift, shocking move,
President Johnson has thrown the
realm of political speculation in-
to a whirlpool of turmoil. In that
same move, he removed the
shroud of a credibility gap which
had hung over his handling of the
war in Vietnam.

Throughout the period of es-
calation in the Vietnam conflict,
the escalation had been accom-
panied by the growth of a corre-
sponding credibility gap within
the United States. The President,
argued his detractors, was a po-
litical opportunist; he was mis-
leading the American people on
the war; he had no real interest
in peace.

But, the past, is now merely
prologue. Sunday night the Pres-
ident announced that he will “not
seek and will not accept” renom-
ination, in order that he may de-
vote the full powers of his office
toward seeking peace in South-
east Asia.

IN DOING $0. the President

made two major sacrifices. He
sacrificed his own political fu-
ture, by deciding that the peace
issue overwhelmed in import-
ance the ambitions of any single
man. And, he opened the way
for the probable nomination of
Robert Kennedy, one of his maj-
or political enemies.

These were not decisions that
could have been made without
great thought and deliberation.
Cynics will argue that the Presi-
dent withdrew from the race be-
cause he believed that he could
not win.

This appears to be a very un-
teneble position. Despite his loss
of popularity, the President was
almost assured renomination.
Furthermore the split among his
detractors between Kennedy and
McCarthy supporters could only
aid his chances.

A POLL taken recently in In-
diana showed just how greatly
his foes were divided. Governor
Roger Branigan, the stand-in
candidate for the President, was

far out in front of both Kennedy
and McCarthy.

Other cynics will argue that
the President's statement was
merely a political move. There
seems to be little logic behind
this notion also. If the President
had been interested in only a
political move, he would have
ended his speech before announc-
ing his withdrawal. The bombing
pause that he had announced ear-
lier was as effective a political
maneuver as could have man-
aged. 1

This fact was recognized by
Maurice Zeitlin, a McCarthy lead‘
er in Wisconsin, who admitted
that the speech “would have tak-
en the wind out of McCarthy’s
sails.” It is not illogical to as-
sume that the President then
would have won a victory in Wis-
consin, and, in the process, many
of his wravering supporters might
have been brought back into the
fold.

IF THE President’s reasons
were not political, then what
were they?

Netmen Fail To Break Jinx,
Edged by West Virginia, 6-3

by MARTHA HARTLE

And the jinx goes on . . .

West Virginia's netters made it eleven straight over
the Panthers Monday at Morgan-town in the season's opener for both
schools. The Mountaineers grabbed four of the six singles matches
and two out of three doubles contests to carry away match honors

at 6-3.

“We -played well and gave
them a good batt1e,” comment-
ed coach Ben Pope, “but they
were just a little more patient
and took advantage of our er-
rors. The errors beat us.”

Both Bill Nichols and Bob
Salembrier. Pope’s number one
and two men, were defeated.
after having won their first sets.

Nichols took his first set fom
Bob Pruett by a 6-2 score and
appeared on his way to win-
ning the match.

“But Nichols seemed to soft-
en up after taking that ﬁrst
set," explained Pope, “Pruett
just kept the -ball going and
played a real good defensive
match.” Pruett went on to take
the next two sets 6-3, 6-2.

Salembrier took his first set
from Marc Parson, but Parson
came on strong in the final two

to Win the match 4-6, 6-3. 6-0.

Tom Stromp and Bill Gold-
stein were singles winners for
the Panthers. Stromp, number
three man, defeated Dave Ear-

hart easily, 6-2, .6-1. Goldsteinl

had to go three with Jef-
frey Jones, ‘but came out on top
75, 1-6, 6-1.

“Stromp thought he was
playing terrible,” added Pope.
“He was behind 2-0 in the first
set when I told ‘him just «to play
consistent and make the other
fellow make the mistakes.”

Shaky Golfers, 15‘/2-5‘/2

by ED CONLEY
It was the ﬁrst match of the spring ,but the West
Virginia golfers looked like they had a full season behind
them as they smashed the Pitt duffers, 15%-5%.

The Panthers played tfair matches for the fi-rst time out, with
all golfers hitting around the “80" mark. But West Virginia’s low 70’s
highlighted by Bruce Keager’s one-over-par 73, were too much.

The only Pather to gain a
victory was Joe Volanski. He
shot an 81, tying his opponent.

play their first game of the
regular season until tomorrow,
when they meet West Virginia
in a home game at Leech Farm
Field.

“We're disappointed," s a id
‘baseball coach Bobby Lewis.
“We wanted to play. We're

ready, but with every day that
we don’t play, we lose the edge.”

‘The Indiana State game was
tentatively rescheduled for May
3, but that isn’t helping t he
present lay-off. Meanwhile, Lew-
is hopes Leech Field will be in
acceptable playing conditions to-
morrow.

Lewis will start the same
lineup that he planned to use
against Indiana State, which
means that Dave Welty will
hurl for the mitters.

“I used Welty in the intra-

squad gameMonday,” said Lew-

is,” and he pitched two innings_
He'll be ready for West Vir-
ginia.”

With Welty on the mound,
switch-hitting sophomore J o e
McCain will start in left field.

McCain is a real good hitter,”
said Lewis. “He looked like he
would really get hot in Cali-

fornia.”

The fact that Welty is start-
ing, seems to be giving To-m
Stickel another cha n c e as a
starting outfielder.

“With Welty playing left

_ field,” explained Lewis, “I would

start either McCain or Stickel
in right field.”

But the coach could only
start one of them, and since
Stickel got just two hits in 23
at-bats in the California Tourna-
ment, the starting berth would
most probably have gone to Mc-
Cain.

With the problem solved, the

only thing Lewis has left to wor- '

ry about is the West Virginia
nine.

“I don’t know anything about
West Virginia,”  Lewis.
“except that they split a double-
header with California and are
now 2-1 for the season.”

against the Mountaineers Dick
Ault. Ault had -the low score,
but Bryan grabbed the back
nine honors and shared the front
nine.

Rick Golden, newly elected
captain, and John Mettney pick-
ed up the final two points, each
tallying one. Golden shot an 80,
while Mettney stroked for an
82. Both of them gained their
points by taking the advantage
on the ﬁnal holes.

The finest Pitt performance
went worthless, though. Henry
Higgenbottom shot a fine 79,
lowest on the squad, but lost
his match, 3-0, to Bob Ault who
came up with a 75.

Keager’s 73 and a 75 shot by
J-ohn Gokey gave West Virginia
two more blanks, besting John
Dellaverson (82) and Bob Raou-
nas (82).

Despite the loss Peery was
not too upset. “We played tight.
Our scores were only four
strokes apart,” he said, “We'll
do better in the return match,
we can win at home.”

That return match is not
Peery’s next problem. The duf-
fers from Carnegie-Mellon pro-

Football News Begins To Pick Up;

Hart Prepares for Spring Practice

Dave llart’s a busy man
these days. There’s still re-
cruiting to do. spring practice
in just about two weeks, a cou-
ple new coaches, and several
other ()dds and ends to ﬁll his
day.

For instance, Monday after-
noon he and his coaches sat
down for the first time to dis.
cuss the football personnel on
hand for the spring drills. Sev-
eral player evaluations will be
taking place in the near future.

This spring Hart will be able
to welcome back one of the
stars of last March, who missed
the entire regular season with
an eye injury. Denny Ferris, 6-0,
190 pound halfback, has been
okayed for spring practice.

Ferris suffered an eye injury
last sutmmer, and while he still
is not 100 per cent recovered,

Ferris has been judged ready
to play football.

On the other hand, Hart has
been notiﬁed that fullback John
V\/hilt’? will be forced to quit foot-
ball beeause of a chronic back
injury. White also missed a good
deal of his freshman and sopho-
more seasons with injuries.

Several other key announce-
ments came out of Hart’s office
recently. Possibly the most im-
portant is the hiring of a new
freshman football coach to re-
place Dr. Darrell Lewis, who
takes over as head coach at
Wtaynesburg College.

The new man is Ned Mervos,
37, from the West Mifflin school
system. Mervos is the physi-
cal education supervisor at West
Mimin. 1

His coaching career started at
Etna High and was followed by

We, Members Of The University Of Pittsburgh, Will Sup-
port Those Pitt Students Who Decide To Refuse Cooper-
ation With Selective Service Because They Consider Our

War ln Vietnam Uniust And lmmoral.

As you may be aware, some Pitt students are no longer accepting their draft
deferments. Theyare taking steps to bring on induction and are then refusing military
service in order to indicate their opposition to the war in Vietnam. Others, faced with
the prospect of induction as a result of changes in Selective Service policies, will refuse
military service when called. These students face jail sentences of five years.

Such initiatives and decisions have come from the students. Most ‘faculty mem-

bers would not feel justified in encouraging any student to take these actions. Nor would ‘

we -want to contribute any sense of exhilaration to a decision that might deprive any-
one so young of his freedom for five years. But we cannot avoid considering our rela-
tionship, as their elders and teachers,‘ to those of our students who make this choice.
Can we let them disappear for five years without any response on our part?

Few of us can declare opposition to the war in so direct and palpable a way.
To accept imprisonment rather than enter military service is an extraordinary act
of faith in the future of this country. Some of us may find it difficult to share this
faith under the present circumstances, but we suppose that if enough young people
take this action and thereby secure some measure of response, it may make a difference

for the future.

We call upon-our colleagues on the University of Pittsburgh faculty to join us in
a collective and public declaration of our support for the Pitt students who are show-
ing their opposition to the war by refusing military service. Our declaration of support
for these students marks our increased concern for those who_ are fighting in Vietnam.
We wish also to support those among our students whose acts in direct oppositionto the

- war involve the risks of moral isolation, obloquy, and long—term consequences for their

future lives and careers.
