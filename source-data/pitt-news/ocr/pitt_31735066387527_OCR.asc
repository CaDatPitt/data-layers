Resident petitions to re—open police Station 4

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

It has been a little over a year

since Station No. 4"~in south Oak—.

land was changed from a gener-
al police station to a special
investigations unit. The effects of
this change have caused dis-
agreement among Oakland resi-
dents, the city and the police
department.

A petition has been circulating
to reopen Station No. 4 on
McKee Place and Louisa Street.
Janet Markowitz, a 12-year resi-
dent of Oakland and an assistant
to the safety committee, is one of

_ the leaders of the petition drive.

”We need a police station in
Oakland. I've called 911 10 times
one night "and have gotten no
response,” said Markowitz.

Markowitz said she has seen
numerous instances of students
engaged in drunk and disorderly
behavior. According to Mar-

kowitz, last weekend 300 stu-
dents were on a balcony at a
party on Dawson Street.

”They [students] don't have the
right to destroy property or incite
a riot,” said Markowitz.

Markowitz said you can't judge
the crime rate soley on the basis
of statistics because a lot of the
crime that occurs in Oakland
goes unreported.

Crime is reported by census-
tract indicators in the city of Pitts-
burgh. Oakland is divided into
eight areas. The police depart-
ment has compiled a statistical
analysis of all reported crime in
the Oakland area from the first six
months of last year which will be

- compared to the first six months

of this year. ' .

Some of these reports were
later shown by the police to be
unfounded," according to Andy

" Masaros, a computer program-
mer with the police department. .

The police department has no

record of its response times. They
are only starting to keep such
records this month.

According to Kevin Forsythe,
an aide to City Controller Tom
Flaherty, ”This is an example of
the mayor's ill-fated public safe-
ty policy.” '

City Councilman Jack Wagner
was opposed to the reorganiza-
tion of the public safety when it
was introduced by the mayor last
year. He has been encouraging
the petition drive to reopen the
station.

According to Rosanne Graham,
an aide to Wagner, he was disap-
pointed with the lack of commu-
nity action when the mayor
announced the closing of the

‘ station.

Graham said, ”lt’s going to be
pretty tough to get it [the station
closing] changed”.

Pittsburgh Police Chief Ralph
Pampena said he sees things from
a different point of view.

Lecture addresses freedom 

By Neata ‘Nicholas
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
Department of Black Communi-
ty Education Research and De-
velopment sponsored‘ a lecture
yesterday afternoon on ”.Freedom
Struggles in the Third World
Countries.”

Jake Millones, assistant profes-

sor of the Department of Psy- _g
‘chiatry and chairperson of

Pittsburghers against apartheid
said, ”The question of freedom is
a timely issue to address whether
it is a discussion concerning
places such as Central America,

_South Africa or Centre Avenue

and Kirkpatrick.”
During the lecture, three Pitt

v faculty members spoke on the is-

sues of freedom in Nicaragua and
South Africa.

professor at Pitt's law school,

The image of Oakland bars
may be changing since many of
them are trying to appeal to a
new clientele through reno-
vations.

Zelda's Greenhouse, located

on Bouquet Street, is one of the.

Oakland bars going through ex-
tensive renovation, according to
Sam Rothschild, general manager
of Zelda's. ‘

”lt [Zelda's] is going under a to—.

Lobel also said that the

Nicaraguan government's main

concern is to achieve peace in

 

the constitutional framework of

their government and that a
democracy should be a represen-
tative government that reflects the
actual participation of the people.

John Beverly, a professor in the
Department of Hispanic _ Lan-
guages and Literatures, said the

struggle for peace has certain Na— 1

tionalist characterisitcs.

”Oscar Arias Sanchez, presi-
dent of the Republic of Costa
Rica, has proposed that Central
America establish a parliament,”
said Beverly.

Beverly also said he believes
the struggle exists in the national
liberation cause. V

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the
Department of Black Communi-
ty Education Research and De-
velopment and a professor of
Black Studies, spoke about the
struggle for freedom in South Afri-
ca. Brutus is a "poet who was ex-
iled from South Africa because of
his efforts to abolish apartheid.

bars renovating  

tions include: a new bar, a new
tile floor, a patio with with two
bars, a dance floor, a new sound
system and a restaurant.

”We’re going to serve a differ-
ent array of American and Italian
food,” he said. ”We want to ap-
peal to a different clientele than
what Zelda's has been used to in
the past.”

Rothschild went on to’ say that
Zelda's present clientele is

primarily young. ’_’We’re just

The Sanctuary, located on Bou-
quet Street across from Zelda's, is
another bar undergoing changes.

”We have got an entire new
stereo system, new dance floor,
new lights, new everything,” said
Missy Warren, a bartender at The
Sanctuary.

Peter's Pub, on Oakland
Avenue, went through renova-
tions last year, ‘according to Bob
Bonesso, manager of Peter's Pub.

”We thought it was time to

”Generally, coverage is no less
than it has been. There has been
a decrease in the number of per-
sonnel [because of the high num-
ber of retirements]. The mayor
has just given approval» for a dou-
ble class [a class twice the usual
size] to enter the police acadamy
in November,” said Pampena.

Regarding response time,
Pampena said that 20 minutes is
not an unusual response time for
a low-priority call especially on
a Friday or a Saturday night.

He said that a comparison of
the first six months’ of 1987 with
those of 1986, showed there
wasn't much of a difference in the
crime rate, although incidence of
murder, rape, robbery, theft and
auto theft has decreased.

Rates of aggravated assault,
simple assault and vandalism in-
creased, however. There was a
threefold increase in the number
of arrests for drunk and disorder-
ly conduct.

Acco_rding to Mark Zabierek,
the communications director of
the mayor's office, ”The question

of the location of a police station‘
is moot. It makes a good neigh- B

.borhood organizing issue.”

Zabierek said there is no corre-
. lation between the location of a

police department and the serv-
ice that it provides.

”[However],. we have less peo-

ple than we like," said Zabierek;

He said that the mayor has in-_ A‘

stituted a ”civilianizing” of the

police department to free police J 

officers from clerical duties.

According to Zabierek, the j

mayor's safety policy ”coordinat-

ed the Bloomfield evacuation and J

the Western Penn prison fire. It

also cut eight fire stationswithout _

decreasing services.”

J Reagan wants $2 70 million in aid for the Contras

‘WASHINGTON — President

‘Reagan, warning of a history of

Sandinista ”deceit and broken
promises,” called on Congress to-
day to approve $270 million in 1
military and humanitarian aid for
the Contra rebels as an insurance
policy for peace in Central
America.

Reagan, in remarks prepared
for delivery to the Organization
of American States, called the aid
package ”a moral obligation”

J and ”the essential guarantee that
' ' the Sandinistas will live up to the

democratic conditions of “the
Guatemala accord.” ,

The pact was signed in August
by five Central American nations,
including Nicaragua.

Although House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas has warned that
Reagan has little chance of ob-
taining such aid, Reagan lectured
lawmakers against abandoning
the Contras after supporting them

in the past.
Congress ”cannot just walk
away,” ‘Reagan said. ‘'1 have

made a personal commitment to
them, and I will not walk away."

The president said he would
”request and fight for” the $270
million package, which adminis-
tration officials have said would
go forward prior to the Nov. 7
cease-fire date called for under
the regional peace accord.

While Reagan lauded the steps
that the leftist Sandinistas have
taken to comply with the region-
al peace accord, he said he also
shared ”a skepticism born of a
long record of Sandinista deceit
and broken promises."

The president demanded that
the aid be continued unless the
Sandinistas ”sat down and
negotiated” with the Contra re-
bels, concluded an agreement for
a cease-fire and established ”full
democracy” in Nicaragua.

Fine for parking in

PITTSBURGH — The city Plan-
ning Commission is recommend-
ing that parking in residential
driveways remain illegal, punish-
able with fines of up to $1,000 a
day, except for specially ap-
proved ”hardship cases.”

The panel on Tuesday advised
City Council to retain a 1958 law
making parking illegal in any por-
tion of the ”front setback” area,
which ranges up to 30 feet from
‘the property line, depending on
the neighborhood's zoning.

The law was intended to pre-
vent people from using their front
yards as parking lots.

in July, Valerie McDonald was
fined $600 for parking in the
driveway of her home in the ci-
ty’s East Hills. The driveway,
which is within the front setback,

Air Force ROT

TC offers choice

of two or four-year program

By Greg Keklak

For The Pitt News

Of the many choices which
confront a student here at Pitt,
one of the more interesting can
be the Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps.

in the ROTC, students have the
option to choose between two-
and four—year programs that will
help them to become acquainted
with the Air Force system. Most
cadets opt for the four year "pro-
gram. The program is structured
so that what is learned in previ-
ous years is expanded upon.

The first year consists of class-
es about various departments of
the Air Force and a general over-
view of operations. Also taught in
the freshman year are basic
things, such as how to wear the
uniform properly and forms of
discipline. Sophomores build
upon this by learning about the
history of the Air Force and what

BL%M COUNTY

its aims are for today and for the
future.

By the time the junior year
comes around, the cadets are ex-
pected to have a solid working
knowledge of the Air Force. The
cadets are then cadet officers and
have assignments. Classes focus
mainly on leadership techniques.
Seniors learn more about leader-
ship and management tech-
niques. In addition to this, senior
cadets are placed on active duty.

Cadets between their junior
and senior years go through the
Advanced Training Program. The
ATP offers the cadet the opportu-
nity to view how the Air Force
works by visiting an installation
and shadowing an officer who
works in an area in which the
cadet is interested.

Included in, the ATP are field
training, training in basic survival
techniques and self—defense,
physical training and a ride in a
jet fighter. .

Cadet Lt. Col. Donald Fattman,
a senior, is one of many cadets
who has gone through the ATP
this past summer. His training
took place at a base in Platts—
burgh, N.Y., near the border of
Canada. The training consisted of
following officers in his field as
they went about their work, ad-
vice on careers in the Air Force
and daily training missions.

”ATP is a very valuable ex-
perience,” said Fattman. ”lt sup-
plements what’s learned in the
classroom well.” His training as
a navigator candidate included
two re—fueling flights in a KC 135,
an air re-fueling tanker. His flights
took him to North Dakota and

' Greenland. This experience for

Fattman was ”

to Potter County where a 38-mile
looping trail is available for
riders.

East of the Susquehanna River,
only a 6—mile trail on Delaware
State Forest land south of Peck’s
Pond, Pike County, is open for
ATV use. It's this lack of places
to ride that Strauss and Bill
Hamilton of- Nazareth, Bob Su-
pon of Bethlehem and other club
members believe is a prime cause
of land abuse problems.

’’If safe trails were provided,
many accidents and land
abuse problems wouldn't hap-
pen,” said Supon.

”We’re not a bunch of Hell's
Angels out for a joy ride,” Hamil-'
ton added. ”But that's the way
we're often looked at.”

While admitting that property
owners are justified in their nega-
tive views of many ATVers,.
Strauss is quick to note that much
of the problem could be alleviat-
ed with, consistent enforcement
of existing laws by the
Snowmobile-ATV Unit of the
Pennsylvania Dept. of Environ-
mental Resources.

An ATV law went into effect in
1985, but Supon said enforce-
ment is difficult because most
ATV owners are not registered.
Enforcement is often inconsistent,
as well, noted Supon, citing in-
stances in the Lehigh Gorge State
Park and other places where
4-wheel drive vehicles are con-
doned, but ATVs are disallowed.

The club promotes registration
of all vehicles operating off the
owners’ property.

”Of over 100,000 ATV owners
in Pennsylvania, only about
15,000 are registered,” said Su-
pon, who rides his ATV over
6,000 miles annually. ”The law
says you're allowed to operate an
ATV on your own land without

.registration, but you can't oper-

ate it anywhere else.”

The trouble is, ATVers soon tire
of the limited access on small
properties and head out onto pri-
vate and public trails and roads.
Many don’t’even know they're
breaking the law, which club
members agree is no excuse.

That's where the biggest
problems arise. In June, a wood-
ed area frequented by ATV riders
in Clearfield County was booby-
trapped with tree limbs tied back
to strike riders, pointed oak poles
set to to puncture their chests,
bailing wire strung at neck level
and steel hooks hung high
enough to catch their eyes. It is
suspected that disgruntled
property owners placed the dan-
gerous devices.

Such is the reaction some peo-
ple have to unrestricted riding
and the abusers who give other
ATVers bad press.

Club members are convinced
that most of the misdeeds attribut-
ed to ATV fans are done by in-
dividuals and small groups that
don't know or care about laws
and don't have their vehicles
registered.

”Some owners don't even
know, that they have to register
their machines, so they don’t,”
, said Supon. ”Most people are un-
-der the impression that they can
ride anywhere.”

She doesn't eat Pop Tarts

By Paul Anater

. Staff Writer

Some years ago, but not too
many, a baby girl was born in the
sleepy hamlet of_Flint, Mich. She
led a normal life, went to and
graduated from a normalhigh
school. After high school, she set
her sights on a career, so she
went to school to becom_e a
manicurist. Sounds like someone
bound to live her life permanent-
ly in the back seat of things, so
to speak. I

But not this manicurist. You've
seen her on Late Night with
David Letterman a million times,
she's been in movies, Pizza Hut
commercials, countless major

magazines, and now, The Pitt"

News. If you're real lucky, you'll
get a chance to see her live
tonight at the Carnegie Music
Hall. Who is this mystery
manicurist? Why, it's Sandra
Bernhard, of course.

"My comedy is odd,” she said
in a telephone interview on Mon-
day. ”Things like, when you're
walking down the street, and you
see a woman in a big car, and

she's got this imperious look on .

her face, and you look down to

Keaton overcomes Baby Boom

By Robin Shepherd

Staff Writer '

Diane Keaton is the type of ac-
tress who, rather than endeavor-
ing to actually become the
character she plays, - uses the
same technique and mannerisms
in almost every role. She is most
successful when, as in her films
for Woody Allen, she seems com-
fortable and at home in the
character. In the new film Baby
Boom, Keaton brings her familiar
Annie Hall idiosyncracies to the
big screen once more.

Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt, the
quintessential yuppie who works
over 70 hours a week in order to
make it to the top of the savage
New York business world. -Then,
unexpectedly, she inherits a

I3-month—old baby, and her’

career plans are drastically
altered.

see that her dress is caught in the
door of her car, that's odd, and
that's funny.”

She said she has no comedic
role models; instead, she admires
"earthy, approachable people
like Gena Rowlands and Tina
Turner.”

She doesn't limit herself to
comedy, either. Although tonight
she'll be doing strictly improv,
she also sings and writes. She has
a book coming out soon called
Confessions ofa Beautiful Lady,
which is a collection of essays.
This spring, she's taking her one-
woman show off-Broadway.

She writes all of her own
material, so when she's not per-
formi"ng, she's busy writing.

Tonight will not be her first
visit to Pittsburgh. She was here
last year for a show at Graffiti and
thinks Pittsburgh's an all right
place. She said her first Pittsburgh
audience was "great, very recep-
tive,” and she's looking forward
to coming back.

She said that she's as off-the-
wall in real life as she is on stage,
so I asked her an off—the-wall
question: "Do you toast your pop
tarts or eat them cold from the
box?" To which shereplied, "l

‘Eventually she realizes she
can't handle both motherhood
and business and escapes to Ver-
mont. The subject of womentry-
ing to cope with having a family
as well as a career is not exactly
new movie territory.

Both Kramer vs. Kramer and

. Tootsie gave the matter effective

dramatic and comedic treatment.
Unlike these films, however,
Baby Boom can't seem to make
up its mind about whether it
wants to be taken as a comedy or
aidrama.

The route it should have chos-
en is obvious. In the film's earli-
est scenes, which poke fun at the
yuppie lifestyles of Keaton and
her |ive—in boyfriend (he wears a
Mudd mask to bed), humor
abounds. Even better are Keaton’s

first experiences with the baby.

Rushing to a business lunch,
she tucks the baby under her arm

never went to college, and col-
lege students are the only people
who eat pop tarts, so I have no
opinion on the subject.”

She got her start on David Let— I

terman when she was doing a
promo for the movie King of
Comedy. She said that she and
Letterman clicked, and since
then, she's become sort of a regu-
lar guest. When asked what the
real David Letterman was like,
she said, "What you see on Late
Night.” She said that he keeps to
himself pretty much and that
she's not sure that many people
know who "the real David Letter-
man really is.” She also stressed
that there is "nothing goingon"
between them.

She's been doing comedy for
12 years now and considers her-
self to have made it. She's,doing
what she's always wanted to do,

namely, performing and writing, '

and is very happy with the way
things have turned out.

Come out to see Sandra Bern-
hard tonight. For a measly $3.50,
you can see a true comedienne.
She's at the Carnegie Music Hall,
so stop by the WPU ticket office
or Oasis Records on Forbes
Avenue for tickets.

I

like a sack of potatoes and then
checks her with the coat—check
girl.

Instead of being content to stay
in this light-hearted mode, Baby
Boom becomes overly ambitious
and strives to make a point about
women in the business world.
Here, it errs on several counts.

First of all, the tone contrasts
too sharply with the film's slap-
stick comedy. Also, its actual in-
tentions are unclear. At the end
of the film, while telling her form-

er company that "the rat race will I

have one less rat," she still plans
on ‘making her already locally
successful homemade baby food
into a national success.

It's as though the writers real-
ized their satirization of the dog-
eat-dog business world was
simultaneously saying a woman
can't have both a family and
career. Suddenly, they decide to

Thursda ctober 8, I987

 
 

 

Sandra Bernhard appears tonight at The Carnegie Music Hall.

show that she really can have it
all: her own successful business,
her daughter and a budding
romance with the local veterinar-
ian, played by Sam Shepard.

Unfortunately, no feasible so-
lutions are offered to the dilem-
ma that millions of American
women currently face. In addi-
tion, the many improbable plot
twists, which could have been
overlooked had the film chosen
to remain a comedy throughout,
merely seem silly when meant to
be taken seriously.

Diane Keaton’s earnestness,
however, is almost convincing
enough to outshine the film's
confused sense of purpose. She
seems utterly comfortable in the
role, playing it so sincerely as to
remind us why she's one of the
most respected actresses of the
'70s and '80s. While J.C. Wiatt
won't make anyone forget Annie

Hall or for that matter Reds"
Louise Bryant, she still must be
viewed as’the most interesting

character Keaton has played in—

years.

The other performers in the”

film, headed by Shepard and
Harold Ramis as Keaton’s love in‘-
terests, are adequate if none too
exciting. The one exception is the

baby, Elizabeth, who steals every ,‘

scene she is in.» The movie is
never more enjoyable than when
she graces the screen.

The bottom line is Baby Boom,
when taken as a lighthearted look
at a career woman strugglingto
raise a child, is a fun and funny

movie. Anyone looking for a sub- ’ -

stantial message on howto solve
the issue will come away disap-
pointed and confused.

Like J.C. Wiatt, Baby Boom
doesn't realize that you can't
have it all. -

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 8, I987

By Patty Pisula

Staff writer

The last time I knew all the
words to all the songs at a con-
cert was when I saw Beatlema-
nia. I knew the words to a lot of
Lou Reed songs. I could ramble
along with about 85 percent of
the Ramones’ repertoire.

But I knew every phrase ex-
ecuted (in every sense of the
word) by that psuedo star, mock
McCartney, hollow Harrison and
lame Lennon. My familiarity with
the material made it easy to ig-
nore the glitches; I went to the
show with the I've-been-listening-

to-these-records-for-so-many-
years-I'd-go-see-Pablo Cruise—if—I—
knew-they-would-do—an-entire-
set—of-Beatles-tunes attitude.
That's also how I felt about see-
ingthe Lynyrd Skynyrd 10th An-
niversary Tribute.

Ten years ago on Oct. 20, a
tragic plane crash took the lives

Then Allen Collins went solo. Pi-
anist Billy Powell went on tour
with a gospel group (perhaps the
Billy Powell Band). Gary Rossing-

Lynyrd Skynyrd on this tour. They
are simply called (you guessed it)
The Rossington Band. It proved
once again, that my Ilth grade
chemistry teacher, Miss Solar-

cyzk (or Mary Molecule, as we

preferred), was right: The
separate parts could never equal
the sum of the whole.

Obviously, these guys, like my-
self, received chemistry grades
plucked somewhere from the
midalphabet. It took them 10
yearsto figure it out. But, with a
bit of tutoring, they did.

It was a good deal more
authentic than Beatlemania.
Original members included Gary
Rossington and Ed King on gui-

Billy Powell on piano. Artimus

Octover [sic] I940 when, I be-
lieve, the Nasties were still
booming [sic] us led by Madalf
 I Heatlump (Who [sic] had only

“ one). Anyway they didn’t get

me.”

That's how Beatle John Lennon
 described the conditions sur-
. » rounding his birth in his first pub-
3 Iished book of whimsy, In His

Own Write.

”How disgustingly ironic,-” I
thought, as I paged through the
book, having just pulled it from
the bottom of a storage box
where it had been crammed for
years.

”An infant escapes the Nazi's
raging Blitzkrieg only to wind up,
40 years later, the victim of a
small handgun, a fistful of bullets
and the trigger finger of a lone
and pitiful assassin. Couldn't God
— whoever or whatever he, she
or it is — have come up with a
better ending for the story of John
Lennon. , .

I own his original editions of
both In His Own Write and Len-
non's second and last literary ef-
fort, A Spaniard In The Works.

These books, marked by an art-
fully fractured use of English,
smile-provoking illustrations (of
Lennon's own hand) and a slap-

 

and-tickle sense of humor were
favorites o_f mine as a boy. Hav-
ing recently rediscovered them,
I feel compelled, on this day be-
tore his birthday (he would have
been 47 tomorrow), to take a mo-
ment to talk about what John Len-
non has meant to me.

Growing up in a fatherless
household, I was free to search
out and test all male role models
as potentials. My older brother fit-
the bill in some respect. My
grandfather did in others. But for
some reason, part of me aligned
myself to John Lennon, a man
from the seafarer’s town of Liver-
pool, Lancashire; a man with
whom I had little in common; a

A man whom I'd never met.
Through the years, I've exa--

mined the contradictions of Len-
non's life and have reveled in
them: Raving rock star; devoted
daddy; risk-relishing homebody;
orphaned son adopted by mil-
lions. I think Lennon understood
that to live meant to change. We
could all learn something from
that.

As a teenager, I began to ap-
preciate Lennon even more. The
untamed, youthful s'camp turned
adult roustabout turned social
maverick turned philosopher -
he seemed to change more often
than most of those around him
and, yet, Lennon never appeared
out of step. In fact, most people
looked toward his example as
they tried to figure out what his
next step would be. This kind of
attention helped make him fa-
mous. In the end, it also cost him
his life. He was murdered by one
of his most devoted fans.

In December, 1984, I hap-
pened to be in New York on bus-
iness. One evening, after the
day's work had been concluded,
I walked through Central Park
and to the corner of 72nd and
Central Park West — to the Dako-

 

ta, Lennon's home. .

I stood in front of the stately
structure, thinking. The evening
of December 8, 1980 must have
been much the same. It was
quiet. A lone jogger whisked be-
hind me, brushing my jacket with
his. I stood where that pitiful lit-
tle fan stood, but I felt different
than I'd expected. I could not
sense the horror that had taken
place on that site almost four
years prior to the day. (I'm not
sure Lennon would have wanted
me to.) I could not feel sad. But
I felt something and determined
that, whatever it was, it was good.

Norman Mailer said it best.
”We have lost a genius of the

Impressions of a great man, spirit

spirit,” he told Rolling Stone.

shortly after Lennon's passing.

Spirit: The force that gives life;
the animating principle. John
Lennon was this to many people.
Never the god some said he was.
Always more than a pop star. But
Lennon was, indeed, a force. That
much remains to whomever was
touched by his art or" moved by
his example. It wasn't his music.
It was his spirit. That's what I've
always felt. I hope I always will.
And, in the final analysis, I guess
that's a good enough ending for
anybody.

MARC
DIICHIN

I've noticed a change in my
thinking over the past few years.

My childhood friends seem like.

strangers. The world seems more
hostile. I don't want to be a doc-
tor anymore, and I think I'm an
atheist.

All of us change friends and pri-”

orities. However, what makes
some of us lose our religious
faith?

Hating your roommate can be helpful

"While the foliage starts to

change and the days seem to go
by increasingly faster, many ques-

. tions of tremendous magnitude

face the on-campus students who
attend this university.
Questions such as: How many
times have you gotten deathly ill
from eating the food in the Tow-
ers Cafeteria? Will the football
team ever again score more than
one touchdown in a game?
Which bars can you get into
without an ID? How can you pass
your midterm exams when you

haven't bought books yet? And, I

of utmost importance, do you
hate your roommate yet?

Ah, your roommate! Yes, that
guy or girl you live with who
seemed so normal only a little
over a month ago when classes
began, but who has suddenly ful-
filled your worst nightmare’ by

sion, and no one would know the
difference. At first, I felt a little
guilty blowing off my religious
duty. But I figured that God knew
how busy I was; I needed rest,
surely he would understand.

As time went on, I made a valid
effort to fit praying into my sched-
ule. Yet, there was always some-
thing else that needed to be done.
My parents understood. They
were primarily concerned with
my schoolwork. I was worried
about staying sane under aca-
demic pressure. Between the
three of us, religion was never
stressed.

So my actions were justified. If '

God, my parents and ‘I under-
stood, then there was no
problem. I lost track of Jewish
holidays, and soon synagogue
never crossed my mind, until re-
cently.

A friend of mine was curious
about the Jewish faith and asked
me a few simple questions about
its backround. Unfortunately, I
couldn't answer him. I remem-
bered more from the movie The
Ten Commandments than from
the Hebrew school classes I at-
tended as a child. I literally had
to show my friend my bar mitz-
vah pictures to convince him that
I was indeed Jewish. ”

Maybe you happen to consider
your roommate your best friend.
Maybe, just maybe, you're sleep-
ing with your roommate.

But, anyway, I want to make
you fully aware that I don't con-

sider it in the norm to hate/dislike‘

your roommate.

I'd be very curious to know
whatmy old roommates are
thinking as they read over this.

I can just see them, standing

there in disbelief, saying, "Gee,

that bonehead. He's going to
write about how much he hated
my guts!” ,

Need not fret, guys,‘ because I
don't intend to do such,a thing,
and for good reason. I haven't
had a roommate yet that I hated
or disliked.

Looking back on my first two '

years at Pitt of living in the Tow-

- ers, it was probably the other way

around.
I never asked my former room-

A mates, but maybe they hated my

guts.

I still chat with the guys I used
to live with and what seems so
surprising is that we get along so
well now. Nothing too congeni-
al. Talking over a few beers at the
Saturday tailgates, that's all.

But, as I remember, when I
lived with these guys in the Tow-
ers, we had a few verbal alterca-
tions (nothing serious) and really
didn't hang out together.

I think the reason I wasn't es-
pecially good friends with my
Towers roommates was that we
were just so very different. The
guy I lived with my freshman year

. was involved with a ‘fraternity,

while my ’roommate.my-sopho-

 
 

 
 

I felt like a traitor to my heritage
and decided toredeem myself.
Luckily, I had the perfect oppor-
tunity. The following weekend
marked Yom Kippur, one of the
most sacred Jewish‘ holidays.
Yom Kippur is known as the day
of atonement. It is the time when
Jewish people ask for forgiveness
from God for their sins. For me,
it was perfect‘ timing.

On Fridaynight, I dressed in
my best jacket and tie for my re-
union with God. The Yom Kippur
service was scheduled for 7:30
p.m., and I arrived at 7:15 to get
a good seat. Though I knew._no
one in the congregation, I felt I
was back to my roots. '

However, as the service
progressed, I grew increasingly
bored. The music was pretty, the
rabbi's speech was inspiring, yet,
I found myself consistently check-
ing my watch.

Something was missing in the
service, and I realized it was my
faith. It didn't seem there was a

God listening to the prayers

anymore.

I left the service frustrated. Why
couldn't I just believe in God? It's
easy, most of the world does it.

Perhaps the time ‘I spent
without religion affected. me
more than I thought.yFor three

And there was nothing wrong’
with that at all. I was naive at the
time and thought since I didn't
hang out with my roommates,
then they must not have liked
me. I thought something was
wrong with me.

I'm pretty secure in the view
that this wasn't the case. I liked
my roommates, and they liked
_me, but we just didn't jell.

Different friends, different
views and different priorities
coming from diffferent back-
grounds —e you know what it's
like.

Looking back on it now that
I'm a senior, though, I think’liv-
ing in the Towers with those two
guys was one of the most benefi-
cial experiences I've had at Pitt.

For two years, Ihlived with two
guys who were both a lot differ-
ent fr_om me, and I came to un-
derstand what they were all
about

Everyone knows all people are
different, but how many of us ac-
cept that theory for what it really
means and adhere to it in social
interaction?

I'm sure there are those of you

presently living in the Pitt Resi-

dence Halls who think something
is wrong with you, or your room-
mate, because the two of you
don't get along.

But there's a positive side to
hating or, at the least, not being
the greatest of friends with your
roommate, unless it's to the point
where you and your roommate

. have fistfights every night.

If you like your roommate,
though, there's nothing. wrong

Bragg’s characteristic political
asides here and is fueled as much
by his uniquely American
working-class language as Bragg
is by his own scholarly, unmistak-
ably Englishvoice.

The range of emotions con-
veyed by Springsteen on Tunnel
Of Love is what gives the record
much of its power. There is the

triumph over desperation in the

driving ”Spare Parts” and the
quiet, meditative ”Va|entine’s
Day.” There is fear and frustra-
tion in ”Cautious Man” and the
Roy Orbison—esque ”Two Faces,”
and there is a sense of confusion
and loss to the LP’s first single
”Bri|liant Disguise” and ”When
You're Alone.”

Springsteen's songs have all the
complexities of real romantic
relationships, with people truly
experiencing ecstacy, hate, guilt,
fear and wonderment. Spring-
steen realizes that both people
and what comes between them
are important; when the lights go

out in Tunnel Of Love, ”It’s just

the three of us — you, me and all
this stuff we're so scared of.’-’
The variety of musical arrange-

ments Springsteen employs adds ..

appropriate calm or excitement
to his songs, as well. ”Ain’t Got
You” simmers as Springsteen
wails over the chunky guitar
chords he thumps out.

”One Step Up” is more re-
strained, with Springsteen layer-
ing ‘quiet organ chords, an
acoustic guitar part and some
tasteful electric guitar fills under-
neath his vocal duet. with Patty
Scialfa. , _

Springsteen has not abandoned
his E Street Band, however.
Drummer Max Weinberg ap-
pears on many of the LP’s tracks,
as do keyboardists Danny Federi-
ci and Roy Bittan. In fact, when
most of the E Streeter’s unite to
play on Tunnel Of Love's title
song, the albumreaches its most
rich, buoyant musical moment.

No doubt Tunnel Of Love, with
its personal tone and appearance
to many as a ”solo” album, will
elicit comparisons with 1982's
Nebraska. But perhaps a fairer
comparison could bemade be-
tween this album and the equal-
ly diverse, emotional|y—charged
The River. Like that record, Tun-
nel Of.Love is Springsteen at his
songwriting best — confident,
honest, exultant and thoughtful.

Tunnel Of Love is what so

I much more rock ’n’ roll should
_ aspire to be —— real, evocative

glimpses of life thatirlefuse to con-
descend or pass judgement.

The only guitar void was the

Two years ago around this

probably be treated to several

may hear that same incantation
again. /

But Gottfried wants this factor
not to intrude on the minds of his
players. .

”They can't go into thisgam
thinking of things like that,” said
Gottfried. ”All we can be con-
cerned about is the game we
have to play and win.”

Well, unlike any of the previ-

Irish.

”We're going to play our basic
defensive package," said Notre
Dame head coach Lou Holtz,
who knew the Panther team well
last year when they beat his Irish
10-9 and held them to only three

field goals. ”We don't know who.-

their quarterback will be, but we
have to prepare nonetheless.”

But their offense, playing a
multiple I formation, is just as in-
timidating, especially with the
likes of senior flanker and legiti-
mate Heisman candidate Tim
Brown.

”We've certainly got our work
cut out for us with him,” said
Gottfried.

”Tim is the most gifted, talent-
ed athlete that I’ve ever been
around,” said Holtz. ”He’s an in-
stinctive athlete, and he makes
things happen. Lots of times you

watch things he does on the field,
and there's nothing anyone can
say to add to it.

”The plays he makes speak for
themselves.”

Gottfried said he is planning to
enter into this game with his own
multiple-pro offense and a 4-3
defensive pattern, but there is
speculation that he may have
something up his sleeve; he has
closed practices to the media all
week.

/‘We're going into this game
with a 3-2 record and will be fac-
ing a team with a 3-0 record,”
said Gottfried. ”We have been
studying the mistakes we've been
making in our own gamesand
the mistakes they [Notre Dame]
have been making in theirs and
learning from them. I can only
say we may have a different atti-
tude when we go into this one.”

Pitt's secret weapon, sums up his
expectations on the game this
way.

"This is generally a very special
game,” said Heyward. "There's
a lot of tradition involved here.
And even though we need the
win, we're all just going to do the
best we can. In my case, just give
me the ba||,.and.l'|l run as far and
as hard as I can-with it.

gas or anything, and sometimes
I get tired.”

If you can, readthis last quote
as, ”I'|l do my best, but give the
ball to sombody else sometime,
OK?" _

The game will be broadcast na-
tionally beginning 7 p.m. Satur-
day evening by ESPN. Jim Kelly
will call the play-by—play, and

Kevin Kiley will provide color

commentary.

Until then, Gottfried has his
own expectations.

”This isa biggie,” he said. "A
lot is going to come out of this
one, and at least we'll be
prepared."

One can't help but think he is _

praying for Notre Dame to have
a few hunchbacks.

Soccer team gets
first tie of season
with Canisius, 2-2

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

It was a cold night at Pitt Stadi-
um as the Pitt Panther soccer

team‘ squared off against. the _

Canisius Golden Griffins. The
game ‘ended knotted at 2, after
two and a half hours of play.

”The team played hard,” said ‘

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher.
’’It was much better than we have
been playing. We had some
chances, but just couldn't get
over the hump.”

Luxbacher shocked some fans '

even before thegame started. He

changed the starting lineup in a

shakeup that was promised at the
end of the last game [a 2-1 loss
to Ohio State]. The most startling
change was the imput of fresh-
man Jay Kapusta in ‘goal.

”The changes were just some

The game started very slow.
Then it was like an alarm went
off, both teams suddenly came
alive, and the action became hot.
Pitt took the ball down first,
and almost put it in, but at the Ia§t
second Griffi_n goalie Dave
Dimitroff knocked it away.
Canisius took over posession of

' the ball.

They moved through the Pan-
ther defense much like Pitt had
just done to them. The Griffins

' moved the ball across the field,

and it looked certain they were
going to score. Yet, this is where
Kapusta showed the form that led
him to the starting job. He
knocked the ball away, but

  THEMARK OF EXCELLENCE  

 

 

.The Great Lakes State's favorite sons clash

 

I. By Vince Longo
‘Staff Writer
This week's matchups in col-

' ‘lege football feature two contests
with early season bowl game im-

. plications and one game involv-

ing two proud programs trying to
return to college football's elite.
In the Southeastern Confer-

~ -ence, Louisiana State University

‘goes against Georgia ”between
the hedges” in Athens. LSU and
Georgia are both aiming to up
their conference records to 2-0 af-
ter winning their SEC openers last
week (LSU over Florida and Ge-
orgia over Mississippi).

With Alabama's loss, and Au-
burn’s and Tennessee's ties al-
ready marring the conference
records of those teams, the win-
ner of this game will become the
early favorite for the Sugar Bowl.

 Over in the Big 10, Michigan
‘State has new life in the form of

a 19-14 upset over Iowa last)

week and a 1-0 record in the Big
10. This week's opponent, Michi-
gan, is also 1-0 in the conference

and, while it's definitely too ear-
ly to start talking Rose Bowl, this
game would have to be classified
as a key matchup for both teams.

Meanwhile, back East, Mike
Gottfried’s Pitt Panthers seemed‘
to have a leg up on Lou HoItz’s
Fighting Irish on the road back to
the top, by virtue of last year's
victory over the Irish in South
Bend and their slightly better
record in 1986.

But it's the Irish who seem to
have gotten their act together
first. Notre Dame enter this game
ranked No. 4, while Pitt con-
tinues to struggle at 3-2.

Last week — 12-3 For the Year
— 25-11

Georgia-21 LSU-20

LSU is emotionally drained af-
ter their dramatic come-from-
behind victory over Florida last
week. "Vince Dooley once again

what less talent than exists at

Florida. ‘

ANALYSIS

Michigan State can't pull the

. upset two weeks in a row, even

home in East Lansing.

Upset of the Week

Pitt-16 Notre Dame-14

A hesitant pick based solely on
history. In 1982, Notre Dame
went to Pitt Stadium as a heavy
underdog and upset the No. 1
ranked Panthers 31-16. This year,
it's happy time for the home
team.

Oklahoma-27 Texas-14

This is one of the top five rival-
ries in the country, but Texas
football has deteriorated to the
point where the Longhorns are
30-point underdogs in the Battle

- of the Red River. This game is just

too intense to be a blowout.
Miami-38 Maryland-24
Miami is due for some sort-of
letdown after big wins over A_r-
kansas and Florida State but not
to the point of losing, of course.

couple more diving saves, and-
they finally gave up. The game re-
mained scoreless.

_Then with 13 minutes left, Pitt
started another attack. A couple
of pinpoint passes got the Pan-
thers in close, they couldn't score
but settled for a side kick.

As the ball sailed across the
middle, Pitt's Dave Moss jumped
up, and put the ball. in. Pitt led
1-0, and that's the way that the
half ended.

”Overall, _I think we played
well,” said Panther Bryan Ham-
mond. ”We changed the system,
and it worked well. I expected to
win.”

The second half was a continu-
ation of the first. The ‘Golden
Griffins were the first to break
through, when Chuck Donner
scored to tie the game at one.

Pitt came back to take the lead
at the‘11 minute mark when
Canisius’s Mike Day inadvertent-
ly kicked the ball into his own
net. Pitt was now up 2-1.

It looked like it would stay that
way, but with two minute's left,
Kapusta couldn't find the handle

of the ball. It rolled around, and

Donner scored his second goal.
It was tied again, this time at two.

The game passed through two
very cold overtimes without
much incedent, and it ended at

”And I really think this is going
to be a good game," Foge
blurted.

Many of the present big guns of
the Panther team this year were
recruited by Fazio and his assis-
tants, such as Ed Miller, Mark
Stepnoski, Billy Owens and the
top gun of them all, Craig Hey-
ward. Fazio said he feels only a
true sense of pride and admira-
tion when he hears good things
about them.

’’I remember sitting in these
boys’ homes and eating dinner
with their families, and, even
though I'm not there anymore, in
a way they're still my boys and

’’I think it's great to see Eddie
Miller back in there at center, and
Mark Stepnoski is really emerging

”On defense, Zeke Gadson,
Tony Siragusa, Troy Washington
— God, I remember their first
days here.

”And Craig [Heyward]  well,
he's in a league all by himself,”
Fazio said.

Aside from anything else, Fazio
wants to see a‘ hard—hitting, hard-
fighting and fair ball game and
wishes no animosity to anyone.

”We told our guys about the
defense, and they are more than
a little wary,” he said. ”But above

Strike will leave deep wounds

 

 

THE PITT News, Thursday, October 8, 1987

 

By Hal Bock

- AP Sports Writer

When labor peace returns to
the NFL, as eventually it must,
you have to wonder how it can
be extended into the locker
rooms.

No strike is pleasant, but the

. nastiness of this one was _com-

pounded by nearly 100 players
crossing picket lines to play in
those things the league chose to
call regular games last weekend.

Those players will still be there
when-the strike ends and their
teammates return. You can bet -
oops, sorry commissioner -— be
sure there won't exactly be hugs
all around.

There is a natural bitterness
when you've been on strike, and

"the guy next to you has been

working, cashing paychecks
while you've been marching
around with a picket sign.

The laboratory experiment in
this phase of human behavior

9

was conducted by major league V

, baseball in 1979, when the regu-

lar umpires struck for seven
weeks at the start of the season.

Because the game must go on,
baseball imported substitute um-
pires, some from the semi-pro
ranks, some from the minor
leagues, some from the sandlots.
Predictably, this did not generate
good will, especially when the
strike ended, and the regular
umps found eight of the replace-
ments added to the league staffs.

Umpiring is a lonely profession
under the best of circumstances.
There is a camaraderie engen-
dered among the men who must
deal each night with dirt-kicking
managers who question their an-
cestral lineage. The replacement
umpires, however, were never

welcomed into the fraternity. '

They were frozen out by the regu-
lars, who would not talk with
them, would not eat with them,
would not even acknowledge
them.

An argument would explode

on the field, and here would

come a manager breathing fire.
The ump under siege would look
for help from a colleague and find
him conveniently studying the
scoreboard or the left field foul
pole. The message was clear:
"You're on your own, buddy."
- There is no reason to believe
football players will react any
differently to line—crossers than
the baseball umpiresdid. '

The NFL drove a nice—sized
wedge into its work force when
it decided to welcome players
who chose to ignore their union's
strike. The league's argument is
that it was legally required to be
prepared to perform. That,
however, did not preventit from
shutting down business in 1982
when the union last struck. Have
its legal obligations changed in
five years, or just its strike
strategy?

Success in sports depends
largely on teamwork and chemis-
try, feeling good about the other
guy. How enthusiastic do you
think the regular Indianapolis
linemen will be about blocking
for quarterback Gary Hogeboom,
who was cashing paychecks
while they were walking a pick-
et line? Will Dallas’ line protect
Tony Dorsett and Danny White

as well as Dorsett and White pro-
tected their annuities?

Some of the brighter minds» in
the NFL, like Bill Walsh of the
San Francisco'Phony-Niners and
Al Davis of the Los Angeles
Masqueraders, advised potential
dissidents to stay out until the
strike was over, rather than have
them straggle in one or two at a
time.

Quarterback Marc Wilson was
the only recognizable Masquer-

aderiin camp, but he needn't

have bothered since Los Angeles
had recycled Vince Evans for
Sunday's exercise. Davis sent
Howie Long and Bill Pickel away
when they came knocking at his
door last Friday, although the two
did return to the replacement
camp on Tuesday.

Walsh had no regulars, and it

- didn't bother him a bit against the

New York Midgets. He even
dusted off the Wishbone, giving
himself and Midgets’ coach Bill
Parcells a good laugh in the Mon-
day night follies.

Hey, what the heck,.why not
have some fun if you can figure
out a way to in this mess? The
locker room laughter promises to
be scarce when the strike ends,
and the troops are reunited.

Eleven
49ers

cross  
lines with
Montana

(AP) — Eleven San Francis-
co 49ers, led by quarterback
Joe Montana, broke ranks with
striking NFL players Wednes-
day and reported back to their
team, sending the number of
returning regulars in the
league over the 100 mark.

The NFL Management
Council had set a l p.m. dead-
line for returning players who
wished to receive a paycheck
this week. And several key
players decided Wednesday
against missing a third con-
secutive payday.

, About 90‘players, including
quarterback Danny White,
running back Tony Dorsett
and defensive tackle Randy
White of Dallas, quarterback
Gary Hogeboom and defen-
sive end Mark Gastineau of
the New York Jets, along with
several players on injured
reserve, had _ reported during
the first two weeks of the
strike.

The number swelled Wed-
nesday, with more than 25
returning. ‘

The defections from the
striking 49ers began Tuesday‘
night with the return of vete-
ran tight end Russ Francis. It
accelerated with Montana,
wide receiver Dwight Clark,
running backs Roger Craig, Joe
Cribbs and Harry Sydney, cor-
nerback Eric Wright, defensive
end Dwaine Board, lineback-
ers George Cooper and Jeff
Fuller, tight end Ron Heller
and defensive lineman Pete
Kugler reporting to camp at
Redwood City, Calif.

Keith Fahnhorst, the 49ers’
player representative, said the

division.
But Coach Bill Walsh said
he would not intervene with

the players coming back like
he did last week.

Among the other players
returning Wednesday were
placekicker Tony Franklin and
running back Elgin Davis of
New England; cornerback
Lester Hayes of the Los An-
geles Raiders; quarterback
Blair Kiel, nose tackle Scott
Keller and tight end John
Brandes of Indianapolis;
center Joe Fields of the Jets;
defensive end Carl Hairston of
Cleveland; running back Frank
Pollard of Pittsburgh; defen-
sive end Eddie Edwards of Cin-
cinnati; defensive tackle Kevin
Brooks, running back Robert
Lavette and wide receiver Karl
Powe of Dallas; running back

Lou Holtz’ Fighting Irish present a big challenge for the Panthers.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1987, 7:15 PM.

Push ’em back! Push ’em back! Way back

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

If your favorite type of football game is
a defensive one, this may just be the game
you're looking for.

The Pitt defense is ranked 25th in the
country against the run, giving up 117
yards per game and is 13th against the
pass with 123.6 yards allowed.

But that's not all.

They have the eighth—best defense over-
all, giving up 240.6 yards per game, and
are 10th in scoring defense (11.4 points
per game allowed). The defense has
recorded 31 quarterback sacks, ofwhich
senior linebacker Ezekial Cadson has 15.

Notre Dame's defense has given up an
average of 269 yards and 11.7 points per
game. They have also held their oppo-
nents to 99 yards rushing per game and
have eight interceptions in only three
games.

These two defenses almost seem simi-
lar, but Pitt is 3-2, and Notre Dame is 3-0.

”Every week their defense has played
excellent football. They held us to no
touchdowns last year [a game Pitt won‘
10-9, in South Bend, |nd.],” said Notre
Dame head coach Lou Holtz. ”They have
a lot of fine athletes. I’m surprised Pitt has
lost two football games — games they
could have won.

”Pitt played very well against us last
year. They have a very good defensive
team and fine freshmen,” added Holtz.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried has
nothing but praise for the Fighting Irish

defense, which Gottfried feels is the
toughest he’s faced. I
”They beat a good Michigan team, and
they beat a good Michigan State team. As
I look at Notre Dame on film — they’re
big, strong and physical with a lot of ex-
perience," said Gottfried. ”They are play-
ing defense better than anyone else."
Getting back to experience, out of

Notre Dame's starting 22 players, 12 are

seniors as compared to the Panthers’ eight
senior starters. But to Holtz, sometimes
experience isn’t all it's cracked up to be.

"Even though you have some of the
same players from last year, they will
change. We're still struggling, and I mean
that sincerely," Holtz said.

Gottfried jokingly replied, ”That would
be a nice struggle. ”They are doing a fine
job playing good solid football.”

But the real question facing the Fight-
ing Irish defense is which quarterback will
start?

The recent slide by senior starter Sal
Cenilla leaves the door partially cracked
for freshman redshirt Larry Wanke and
freshman Darnell Dickerson. But for
Holtz, it shouldn't matter.

”We play our basic defensive package.
We don’t know who their quarterback
will be, but we have to prepare I don't
think there’s anything we can do. We
have to be concerned about how well we

play," said Holtz.

It may not be a problem for Holtz, but
hopefully it won't be a problem for the

Panthers.
