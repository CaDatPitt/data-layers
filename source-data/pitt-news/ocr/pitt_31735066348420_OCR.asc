Ziegler’s Engagement

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The Student Government (SG)
,Board voted unanimously Wednes-
day to support an invitation made
to Ronald Ziegler, the former Nixon
press secretary, to speak February
24 in David Lawrence Hall.

The 5-0 vote came in the presence
of about 40 persons, many of them
students attending an SG meeting
for the first time to protest on
ethical grounds the Ziegler invita-
tion made by the _SG Programming
Committee.

Because of some opposition to
Ziegler’s ‘planned appearance here,

_ and because of the controversy
which surrounds his national lec-
ture tour, the signing of a $2500
contract with Ziegler’s New York
booking agent had been delayed

1 pending the SG Board’s approval of

 

the engagement. But with its
consent, the contract was signed
and mailed after the meeting.

Students objecting to Ziegler’s f

visit contend the Student Govern-_
-ment should not allow him to earn a
profit from his role in the Water-
' gate affair. - ,

Thevote came after a Program-
ming Committee report by Nancy
Baron explaining the invitation’s
rationale, and a series of speeches
by members of the audience who
were both for "and opposed to

Ziegler’s slated lecture_.,_,,It was the '

last official action of the Furick
administration which left office last
night. «
The meeting began in its usu

chamber—a small dimly lit room on
the Student Union’s third ﬂout-
but moved downstairs to‘ a large‘
dining room when SG President

Peace and War

BY PAUL MAZUR

Peace and war will be the topic of A

‘study for "a special program to be
held here in the Fall 1975-76
semester. ' ' A 

Participants in the (Peace and
Conﬂict Studies Term will receive

15 undergraduate 12 graduate’

credits according to Jerome Lau-
licht, Director of the Program.

These participants will be stu-
dents already focusing. much of
their attention on peace studies or
international relations or are ser-
iously thinking of doing so in the
future.

“This is not an easy way to get 15
credits,” Laulicht said. “Students
qualifying for this program must be
highly motivated to work in this
area. Most of these people will be
interestedin going further in these
studies,” he said.

crowd.

Most of the student expressing
opposition to the Ziegler invitation

Ziegler would simply make in
interesting lecturer.

“I don’t think we should pay
Ziegler 10 cents to speak here,”
complained one student who said
he was attending his first SG
meeting. “I don’t want to pay
anyone who has conspired for
several years to screw my head
up.-”

But another student countered,
“If people on this campus want to
hear Ziegler speak, then they
should hear him. Besides, he

Black Community Solid! y

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
The University administration will

-announce today higher costs for

campus-housed students, including
rate increases for Pitt dormitory
rooms and meal plans of approxi-
mately 4.5% and 8.4% respec-
tively.

Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor of
business and finance, who will

announce the decision, did not

have the exact ﬁgures when con-
tacted last night. _
But Larry Platt, the newly elected
President of Student Government,
was shown the ﬁgures by Dutton at
a meeting yesterday. Platt ex-
plained the dormitory room rates
were going up $40 per year, and
the meal ticket prices were being
raised between $14 and $45, de-
pending on the plan. ,
_ He added students who purchase
the 14; and 19 meal mean-plans
would bear the brunt of the
increase. Those two plans will be

Backs Gurtiss Porter

BY REBECCA SCHORIN

V Pitt’s black community ex-
pressed overwhelming approval of
Curtiss Porter as‘ chairman of the
Black Studies Department during a
campus survey conducted yester-
day-

Of more than 150 black students

interviewed, 94% of those aware of
the issue expressed themselves
strongly in favor of Porter as
chairman.
v A small percentage of those polled
were in opposition to the Porter
appointment, and many said they
did not know enough about the
issue to state an opinion.

One sophomore at Pitt summar-
ized the appointment as, “the best
thing that could have happened.”

But although students were
pleased with Porter’s appointment,
theydid express resentment at the
delay and the confusion that
"acquiring a chairman has caused.

‘Many students commented that,

“it should have been done a long
time‘ ago-” . .
Terry Graham said he was “glad

1 they ﬁnally got it settled.
. ‘‘It should have been a relatively

easy process but there was a lot of
confusion, misunderstanding and
departmental politicking,” he
added.

, Pre-med student Herbert Jenkins

‘agreed that Porter “should have
been there from the start. He
would have been if it wasn’t for the
bureaucracy in the Pitt system.”
One black faculty member at Pitt
commented on whether Porter was

the right man for the chairmanship. '

“Of course, he is, because he was
‘chosen by the majority. That makes
-himthe right man ‘in a democra-

’n_.

   
 

...'
 «

 

Chuckie Thompson, a sophomore
at Pitt, agreed that, “Porter

deserved the job,”. and ‘Valerie.

meal meal-plan prices will be
raised only $25 and $14 respec-
tively.

“We are raising the prices simply
in order to maintain the same level
of services, while outside costs go
up, Dutton explained. And also to
continue our break-even status.”

He added both services are oper-
ated on an auxiliary basis--not
subsidized by the state legislature
or endowments--which means they
are vulnerable to the present
market price increases.

Platt said Dutton indicated the

‘ deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life."

The Programming Committee is
responsible for contracting enter-
tainers and speakers who will
appeal to the interdst of Pitt
students. «

Ziegler’s evening lecture will be
on “The Presidency and the
Press.” The theme of his national
lecture tour, which currently in-
cludes many colleges and universi-
ties, is “The Use and Abuse of
Power.” ’
According to his contract, Ziegler
must make himself available to
speak to classes during the day
before his speech.

Although his tour has aroused
national attention, only Boston
University has pulled out of an
agreement with the former press
aide. According to Ziegler’s book-
ing agent, William Leigh, Boston
University could have been forced
to pay, but Ziegler decided not to
“fight it” and accepted another
speaking engagement for that date.

Senior Lyle; Wood remarked,
“The University didn’t want
Porter, they wanted to put in
someone they could manipulate.
But Porter will advance Black
Studies, he won’t phase it out.”

Porter was officially appointed
last Thursday by Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome L.
Rosenberg. Along with the ap-
pointment a study commission was
created whose function is to
consider the future of the depart-
ment. Members of the commission
will be appointed by Dean
Rosenberg and Provost Rhoten A.
Smith.

Joey Fuller of the Black Action
Society remarked, “There is relief
that the appointment has ﬁnally
been made.” “However,” she
added, “if the Administration had
any sensitivity it wouldn’t have
happened. The administration
wasn’t able to come up with any
good reasons not to appoint
Porter.”

On whether Porter was qualified
Fuller said, “Who could be more

“Although the program is prim- (

continued, “about 1/4th of the
participants will be graduate stu-
dents.” '

The Peace and Conﬂict Studies

seminars, team projects, ‘films and
other events according to Laulicht.

S Picking ‘cane’

BY W. JACK ROMBERG
The status of the UAR (Under-
. _-graduate Academic Review) has
been batted around the University
for almost two years. Last term the
. Student Government Board inter-
ceded and published the class’
surveys collected for the winter of
1974. Optimists hailed this as a
jsignificant effort to get student
I involvement in course evaluations,
while pessimists shrugged their
shoulders and said, “Big deal.”
The UAR consisted of a series of
computer tabulated statistics of
students’ answers to questions
about the nature of the course and
the professor involved. A typical
question was, “How well does your
, grade in this course reﬂect what
3 you have learned?” The ambiguity
;. of this question‘ characterizes the
dilemma of the UAR. In short,
publication of the UAR proved
something [thus proving the
pessimists wrong]; just what,
nobody seems to know. ' .
 When the SG Board sat down in
an attempt to improve the
questions on the survey, it was
' nearly impossible to come up with
questions which were less confus-
, ing and more insightful than the
-1- ‘ original: ones. This led to an
argument over the purpose of the
f, UAR, which in turn produced two
;. .lines of thought. _ .-
The ﬁrst was that the UAR_shoiild
1 be an attempt to get student input
_A into the educational process. The
' second line said that it..sh_ould be an
; aid ‘ for students in tclioosing
' v courses. In reality, the"UAR was
merely a way of guaginglwhich
courses were" “easier” and which
. professors were more popular, thus
* _j. yielding little value to either of the
 above stated purposes. The UAR,
. then, is a reflection of antiquated,
V ’ perverted educational attitudes at
«T3; Pitt.
‘ H The basis for these attitudes is
grades, and the questions which
surround them. Are students in
. college to earn grades for graduate
’ '_ school or to learn? Defenders of the
educational system at Pitt will say
that it is possible to do both, but
publication of last term’s UAR, and
l». l in fact, all previous UARs show the
‘ contrary.
I When a student consults the UAR
to help with course choice, he or
she generally looks at two
,'._ questions, how well previous
' -, students rated the teacher on a
 scale of l to 5, and how difficult
"H was the course. The rest of the

plans.  are both problems which deeply affect many students on
this carnfius. We urge Platt to live up to his campaign and see to it that
~ students’ concerns are ﬁnally acted upon.

A , With such prompt and responsible leadership to act under, we trust

the Student Government Board will lose no time translating the hopeful
spirit of the inauguration into action.

IIAR Prospects

questions are too ambiguous to be
very helpful. So the UAR becomes
a way to ﬁnd a “cake” course.
Although this is not an ideal
situation, at least the UAR helps

some students, irregardless of the

value system, choose courses. As a
channel for student input into
education, however, it fails utterly.

Some students claim the admini-
stration has blocked any attempt to
give the UAR some meaning, for
example, by being used to help
reach decisions on faculty tenure.
This claim certainly has merit. On
the other hand, how can anyone
expect the administration to accept
a survey which is merely an
attempt to objectify a series of
subjective values via statistical
manipulation.

What is needed is a. joint

, student-administration attempt to
' improve the methods for evaluating

courses, not necessarily through a
UAR. The proper forum for this is
the Senate Council. Perhaps the
new Student Government Board
could urge the formation of a joint
committee for course evaluation..
The results of course evaluation
should be twofold. First, it should
initiate the. restructuring of a
course which is found faulty, and it
should -be used in determining
faculty tenure.

This committee could use several
methods, or combination of meth-
ods in its evaluations, of which the
survey might be a part. Other
possibilities include; observation
by independent students and
faculty peers, critiques by selected
(or voluntary students) within a
class, or even the hiring of
efﬁciency experts to analyze the
effectiveness of some of the more
practical oriented courses at Pitt.

The important point is that
students should be having mean-
ingful input into the educational
process at Pitt. To deny this is to
make a sham of the ideals of
education, and certainly of the
ideals of a liberal arts institution.
The administration, if it is at all
serious about improving the quality

‘ of education, should realize this.

Finally, the importance of the
students role. No student can
afford to be apathetic about the
quality of his education. To allow
the UAR to stagnate at its present
level, places at least an equal
amount of guilt for educational
stagnation on the student, as on
the administration.

Equal Rights Or
Special Privilege

Dear Editor,
When I came to Pitt as a freshman
I was unprejudiced. I even

became angry at my father when he
ridiculed minorities and spoke of
them using derogatory names. I
moved into Tower A and found I
had a black roommate, which _I
accepted believing that I could
learn about black culture first
hand. We got along great, with the

exception of a few times when

some black people would come to
the room and, surprised that my
roomate lived with a white person,
would call me “white” or
“honky.” My roomate always
apologized for them after they left.
He had a name for them too. He
called them “niggers.”

Now I am a senior and somewhat
wise to the ways of the world. I
have discovered that blacks around
Pitt receive EXTRA SPECIAL
privileges because of the color of
their skin. These privileges in-
clude: special policies regarding
lower admissions grades and
special financial assistance for
CAS, ‘the School of Nursing, the
School of Engineering, the medical
school, the law school, etc., etc.
This policy holds true for other

colleges also, Pitt is not alone. By .

demanding equal, rights, black
people receive special privileges
not shared by whites.

An excellent example of this
occurred in the dance marathon
two weeks ago. What started out as
a good time for the benefit of
charity ended up in a cold war
between black and white dancers.
My roommate was in the marathon
and quit because he was disgusted
by this--disgusted by all black

judges, all I black referees (a
“token” . white was included),
mostly ‘ ‘soul’ ’ music and the

glaring unfairness of the referees.
This disgust was not his alone. It
was shared by the majority of white
dancers who were covertly bullied
into submission. Ask any other
white person who participated in or
watched the marathon. The winner
was easy to predict by knowing the
sponsor of each candidate. My
roomates and I all predicted that
couple #29 would win; they
couldn’t lose. They were black and"
sponsored by ' BAS. For those
people who haven’t heard yet, ﬁve
couples ﬁnished -- two blacks, one
mixed, and two" white. The prizes‘

were given outin that order_, not _

very hard topredict!

I am "certainly not_ opposed to
equal rights,‘,-‘ but ,_I think it’s about
time we do iayvay with special
privileges. Should "certain people
be more ‘equal than others?
Perhaps what we need is a White
Action Society to assure that white

people get _"‘equal’.’_righ't's,' includ- 

ing an equalnumber of whitepand

Marathon. '-',   V.

A Student Makes
A Clarification

Dear Sir,

In an article on Friday, January
24, my views on ROTC seem to
have been misinterpreted. Let me
now explain my views.

I can see nothing better for the
armed forces than to get qualiﬁed
men from a university for its

H the ‘wayside. _

V - r‘ .. . . . . . .. ,
i’'',. ._u I . .7 xi . ‘. ,~4 ‘ ', it .-‘I .

officers. However, I believe that as
ROTC exists on campus, it is
wrong.

I could agree with Peter Karsten’s
idea of making ROTC a separate
school with a degree in military
science. However, I think this
would defeat the purpose of the
armed forces getting university
men. They would be getting who
had circumvented the normal
degree program.

Far more preferable would be if
ROTC was either an off-campus
extra-curricular activity or offered
as some kind of graduate work (not
affiliated with the University).
Allowing students to use ROTC
credits to graduate in place of
credits which the University
requires in other areas from every
other student deprives the ROTC
student of part of his liberal arts
education.

If the armed forces want men with
a university background, they want
people with non-military degrees.
Therefore, I would prefer to see
ROTC moved off campus, perhaps
across the street, but completely
disconnected from the University.

Now is the time for student action
before any change in the present
policy is made. Through letters like
this or through conversation we
should let our feelings be known.’
Student Government action is also
called for.

If the Student Government follows
the interest of students in this
problem,J will consider my having
bothered to vote worthwhile._

  Exorcism

BY JUDE_3 WUDARCZYK

Washington--The latest govern-
ment statistics have revealed that
there is another shortage--a short-_
age of exorcism cases. '

A Jesuit spokesman revealed that a

last year at this time there was a
great demand for exorcists. “It
seems that everyone was getting
possessed. Now with inﬂation and
recession, no one has time for the
devil. Lastyear, we had received
hundreds of calls every day. So
many, in fact, that we had to hire
additional telephone ' operators.
But, this year it’s all different.”
Protestant churches have been
equally hard hit by the shortage. A
renowned Evangelist noted that the
demand for exorcisms had tapered
off last" February or early‘ March
and had steadily dwindledto the
point where no one-was getting
possessed anymor"e..' “We used to

have our hands full with exorcism‘ .

cases at the revivals, but, now the
stor.y’s altogether different."
The decline in exorcism cases is

women from all denominations into

Congress.  ‘

hoping for the " day when the
country, will "once again boom with a
possession craze. However, most
persons involved in the business
are skeptical that such a day will
ever come. “Our heyday.is over,”
sadly remarked one ex-exorcist,
while waiting in line to draw his
unemployment compensation.

While many are looking to Blatty
to draw them out of their grim
bind, others are seeking new
sources to get people interested in
being possessed once again.
However, -the new prospects look
equally dim.

One advertising spokesman noted
that his publicity campaign to
encourage exorcisms is nil. “Our

Prior Wrestling
News Requested

Dear Editor,

I am concerned that no publicity
prior to wrestling matches or
gymnastic meets is ever given.
Good coverage of these events is
given AFTER’ an event but it has
not occurred that these events are
ever in the Events section of the
Pitt News a few days before they
actually take place. Many times
General Information (in the Stu-
dent Union) doesn’t even have a
schedule of these sports-

I recently tried to find out the date
of the next wrestling match. After a
long‘ goose chase through Trees
Hall I finally found out by asking
someone standing around the
Ticket office. I asked some people
at the match how they found out
about it, hoping to find a lead on a
schedule. No such luck. I was told
that one just has to ask around. I
recently found out about the
gymnastic meet last Friday from
someone who had also found" out by
chance.

Often I have wondered, after
reading the coverage on a sports
event, where does one ﬁnd out
when’ these meets are held AHEAD
of time? Couldn’t the Pitt News put
a short notice in the events section
for all of us budding sports fans?

Sincerely,
M.B. Andrius

interested in the stuff.” V

A spokesman for Satan’s Circling
Inferno Employment Agency ad-
mits that earth isn’t the only place
hard_ hit by the decline in the
exorcism economy. “We have the
devils, but the demand for
possession -just isn’t there, despite
our lowered rates and increase in
service. Last year, we just didn’t
have enough devils to goaround.
But for the last several months, we

. haven’t had the customers. Orders _
fell off drastically after the first

quarter of 1974. People just aren’t
interested anymore. It’s a shame,
because we lost a good market.”

With no relief in sight, a band of
ex-exorcists petitioned President
Ford to finda way to relieve them
from their plight, but the President
was at a football luncheon, and not”
available for comments.

  Ridin ’ ‘the Buses Is a Cheap Way

BY STEPHANIE HERDER
If high gasoline prices are getting
you down, and thoughts of another
price hike make you shudder,
maybe it’s time to start using
public transportation. Pittsburgh’s

/--Port Authority (PAT) has added
’ --’s/peed, convenience and new ser-

‘O ggyainted U-Buses around campus

vices that can make riding the bus
not only bearable but more enjoy-
able.

You can shave $53 off commuting
costs by taking advantage of PAT’s
biggest bargain—the $100 yearly
permit. The permit is now selling
for $90 and can be purchased at the
PAT Service Center or by mail.

Weekly and monthly permits can
save students between $.60 a week
and $5 a month, and can be bought
at the Student Union Ticket Office.
A rack containing timetables for
PAT’s routes is there, too. \

You’ve probably seen brightly

McKnight Road area. Fares vary
‘from $.40 to $1 depending on how
far you’re going.

Although the buses only run
Monday through Friday and don’t
make evening trips, most U-Bus
riders think the service is conven-
ient. “lfl didn’t take the U-Bus, I
would have to take a bus into town
and then transfer to a bus coming
to Oakland,” says Mary Ruth
Williams, who travels from the
Moon Run area. “It’s really great.
The bus lets me off right in front of
my house.” .
The U-Bus riders’ chief complaint
is the lack of weekend‘ trips.
Greenﬁeld U-Buses carry about 240
passengers daily but according to
driver Michael Milanek, there are
not enough riders to make it
proﬁtable for PAT-to expand its
service.

The Moon Run U-Bus that Wil-

liams rides makes one trip in the
morning and one at night. Still,
only about eight people ride in the
evening.

Another timesaver for commuters
is the Red Arrow Express, a direct
bus route between Oakland and
downtown Pittsburgh. Starting at 8
am, the Red Arrow Express picks
up passengers at eight downtown
stops, then travels to Oakland via
Bigelow Boulevard. The seven bus
stops in Oakland include Solider’s
and Sailor’,s Memorial Hall, Child-
ren’s Hospital and The Playhouse
before taking the Penn-Lincoln
Parkway back to downtown.

Red Flyer Express routes are
another way to escape traffic
snarls. In the morning rush hour,
buses and trolleys marked Red
Flyer make one or two stops in the
suburbs, then travel express to
downtown. The network of 40

county-wide routes covers every
major Pittsburgh traffic artery. In
the evenings, the Red Flyer makes
one or two downtown stops then
travels express to the suburbs.
PAT’s Park-N-Ride lots can eli-
minatea long hike to and from the
bus stop. Commuters can drive

‘ into the lot, leave their cars there

all day and take- the bus. Most of
the lots are free.

For students with early classes,
PAT’s “Early Bir ” special lmocks
$.15 cents off the fare on all buses
and trolleys arriving downtown
before 7 am. But if you play your
cards right, you won’t have to pay
at all. The “Wild Card Bus”
appears throughout the PAT sys-
tem daily, and everyone rides free.

PAT’s weekend services include

- the “Big Buck” pass and tours to

places like Seven Springs. Two
adults can ride all weekend for $1

to Go

on the pass. On February 15 and
23, PAT will offer one-day tours of
Seven Springs. ' Bus far and
admission to the resort is $7.

With the opening of the Schenley
Park Ice Skating Rink last Sunday,
PAT initiated its newest service.
The ride from Oakland costs only
$.10 and timetables are available at
the rink.

;Applications are available for
vacant positions on Pitt's two
Judicial Boards -- .two on the
Residence Hall Judicial Board and
three_ on the Campus Judicial
Board. Those selected will fill the
remained of the two-year terms of
those who have vacated. Any
student is eligible for the Campus
Judicial Board positions, but one

must be a dormitory resident to I

qualify for the Residence Hall
Judicial Board positions. Applica-
tions are available "in IOSSU.

Fellini Visions Stunning;

BY M. C. PILECKI

When Federico Fellini looks
"back, the image is one of reality
transcended into a super-reality of
memories, dreams and fantasies.

His latest reminisce is Amarcord,
meaning “I remember,” the tale of
one year in the growing up of a
youth and his village, practically a
separate planet in the tumultous
world of the 1930's.

This is no mere essay in nostalgia.
Fellini’s portrait of the past is
without sentimentality but rather
ﬁlled with a deeper emotion of love
for a lost time and the cherished
dreams of another day.

_ There is no central character as

 .' such, unless one understands the

village as a whole -- its terrain and
its inhabitants -- as the core of the
movie. The town is one of those
semi-sleepy little places couched
by the sea, where the natives are

i ,provincial but ever exposed to an

increasingly converging world.
There's Titta, the young Fellini
character whose older self is doing
the remembering for the ﬁlm, a
rambunctious youngster who does
daily battle with a loving father
under the protective wing of a

 gentle mother. Titta’s friends are

like‘ a bunch of boys growing and
dreaming together, clashing with
whatever form of casual authority

P is handy.

E‘.

 

- Surrounding them are the ﬁgures
of the first discovery of sensuality,
like the large-breasted math
teacher whouwould look at home
dressed in leather and carrying a
whip. Or the voluptuous tobaccon-
ist, who immense features and

s '_ earth mother image strike many a

fancy. And Volpina, an insatiable

- whore who gives herself indiscrim-

,‘.—

inately.
And at the center of the sensual
images, for the old as well as the

_, young, is Gradisca, the quintes-
. sence of modern femininity. The

_.-«
;

 

careful curls, false eyelashes,
clinging satins and hip-swinging
walk are not so much affectations
but the components of a sensual
image. A perennial romantic,
Gradisca dreams of being whisked
away by a cinematic hero like Gary
Cooper, but laments the reality of
being thirty, highly desirable but
still single, and almost‘unattaina-

- ble because of her fantasies.

i‘uEmmcInuelle’ Dull Sex

There is no “plot” to the movie,
just as there is no “plot” to life.
The movie opens in the spring,
when the tiny world is coming alive
and everything seems softer and
more beautiful than before. This
changes to summer, which brings
the tourists to the shore and the
glamorous Grand Hotel, the object
of many a local dream. Autumn
brings a quieting and a_ sadness,
leading to the winter of change
which leaves the village world less
dreamy, less innocent than before.

The year is ﬁlled ‘with many
memories, of the near-fantasy of
the super-steamship Rex passing

by, ﬁlling the villagers with an»

awe and, for some, a longing for
the winders of the outside world.

‘That world comes storming into

town with the grandiose visit by a
leading Fascist official, whose
entry accompanied by a huge
flowered image of Mussolini and all
the parade-trappings‘ of" the chil-
dren make Fascism less than the
war force it turned out to be, but
just another idea that had come
along to be clung to.

Fellini shrouds many of his
images in mists, and adds snow or
the springtime “manine”
[“fluffs”] to keep the picture away
from too much reality. There’s a
dream-like quality even in his
sharper images of the seasons, of
the dazzling blue streak of the sea
or the earthy brown of the village.

The film is not intended to be
“accurate,” but to be made more
real because reality is ﬁlled with
dreams and notions, not just facts.
Amarcord is probably the most
lyrical of Fellini's ﬁlms, ﬁlled. with
the poetry of one’s memory of life
as itronce was. Really was.

Can sex be dull?

An innundation of anything in
movies can lead to boredom, even
something as naturally entertain-
ing as sex. At first it’s interesting,
then it gets funny, then blatantly
ridiculous, and by the end of the
ﬂick it’s ho-hum time.

That pretty well sums up
Emmanuelle, which avoids being
just ‘a basic run-of-the-mill fuck
ﬂick by virtue of pleasant settings,
fashionable wardrobe and travel-
ogue-like photography touches that
don’t make the regular rounds of
the Liberty Avenue houses. It’s at

fairly bland dirty movie, but

_because it’s a French dirty movie it

rates a ﬁrst-run house and a few
thoughtfully raised eyebrows.

The story concerns a group of
French diplomats and their wives
stationed in Thailand. There
doesn’t seem to be anything in this
exotic country for these wealthy
people with their lavish houses and
country clubs to do, so they all
consort in various affairs to relieve
the boredom.

Enter Emmanuelle, the delicately
beautiful wife of a particularly
active satyr. But, peculiarly e-
nough, she doesn’t seem.,to want to
join in the fun. Everyone, even her
husband, chastises her for her
little-girl view of sexuality. She has
to grow up, be a woman, and screw
everything that moves.

That’s about the gist of the

picture, which is just one sex scene
of some sort after another, where
everyone, regardless of youth or

variation imaginable.

It’s all supposed to be a lesson in
sensuality, but it seems more like
an adolescent wet dream. And

Vietnam Documentary

“Hearts and Minds” of War

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

When New York Times reporter
Seymour Hersh asked Senator
Frank Church on a news program
last Sunday whether he might
suppoft the President's request for
$300 million in‘ aid to South

,Vietnam,- the’ Senator snapped

vehemently.

Could be Church has always been
opposed to our involvement in
Indochina, but it also could be he’s
been having nightmares about it
since seeing Hearts and Minds, a

.documentary produced by Peter

Davis which attempts to chronicle
and explain the Vietnamese war.
The film was almost not released.

Davis, who previously produced.

The Selling of the Pentagon,
finished it last August, but
Columbia Pictures stalled distribu-
tion for fear of gargantuan law
suits. Walt Rostow, one of the
war’s architects, has already filed
suit in California, charging he did
not authorize the release of his
interview for the documentary. But
eventually, another distributor
purchased the ﬁlm, and the official
opening "last week was in the city
where some would say it all began
-- Washington DC. Church was one
of the only biggies attending the
premier, and as Washington Post

Vietnamese woman explaining how

For the 1975 college student,
Hearts and Minds, in a cataloguing
way, is an “Everything You Always
Wanted To Know About The
Vietnam War But Never Bothered
To Learn.” But more importantly
for the modern student, the film
raises “moral questions concerning
war--ones to be dealt with and
kept close by for easy future
reference. ,

What role should we play in
preventing the spread of commu-
nism, a la domino theory? Hearts
and Minds suggests we have gone
too far -- to the extent of placing a
client government at the. helm of
South Vietnam, while realistically,
the US ﬁghts the commies of the

‘ North. And the light at the end of

the tunnel that JFK couldn’t quite
see is now being obscured more
and more by Gerald Ford’s new
contact lenses.

Modern philosophers such as
Michael Waltzer are intent on’
studying the moralityof war and
the tactics used to ﬁght; Hearts and
Minds serves as a visual textbook.
To see Americans dying in a
far-away land is indeed painful, but
it is excruciating to learn and to see
with your own eyes a Saigon
carpenter who builds 900 childrens’
cofﬁns each week. It is also painful
to bear with your own ears a former

Perhaps the notion which helps
explain much of what the ﬁlm
shows is the American’s quick
obedience to authority. The idea is
usually talked about in reference to
Hitler’s Germany. As Lt. Coker
explains in the movie, Americans
are taught to obey their Mom’s

It was a big disappointment all

if

C-«

- s»ll(‘it‘-S to a single USC lay-up to pull

short 64-62. Perhaps head coach
Buzz Ridl expressed the team’s
sentiments best.

“We’re disappointed, of course,” '

said Ridl. “The game was up there
for us to win and we didn’t. It was
just a great game and too had
someone had to lose. But I was
proud of our team.”

The Cats had fought back against

A the Gamecocks who" led by as much

as ten points twice in the ﬁrst half.
Down 42-34 at the start of the
second half, the Cats rallied, as
they did against Rutgers, with Kirk
Bruce, who was game high with 16
‘ppints, hitting three quick p jump

within four, 44-40.
The Cocks then built the lead back
to eight with Alex English, who

scored 15 in the game hitting from

twelve after Stu Klitenic popped

from the outside. But the momen-
tum then began to swing toward
the Cats with Melvin Bennett (11
pts.), Tom Richards (8 pts.), and
Jim Bolla (6 pts.) hitting for three
quick scores.

After Nate Davis connected from
14 feet, the Panthers went into a
deliberate type offense forcing the
SC five out of their favorite 2-1-2
zone into a man-to-man. That was
all the Cats needed as they
consistently went to the -hoop
unmolested and with a basket by
Starr went in front 52-50 at the
eleven minute mark of the half,
their first lead since the early
going.

The Cats managed to stay on top
despite the Bamecocks’ ability to
ﬁnd the net. They -ran the clock
down at least one minute with each
possession and usually found
themselves with a lay-up for their
troubles. All ﬁve Cats in the line-up
at that time got into the act and
they soon found themselves in front
by an almost unbelievable four
points, 60-56.

fﬁoring in the ﬁrst period.

by the Pitt Hockey Club, the St.
Francis skaters managed to pop
out of the frying pan for two goals
before frizzling away, 13-2.

Left wing Denny Browne knocked
up his league goal total by 500% as
he zoomed around the stationary
Frankies for ﬁve goals on the night.

His ﬁrst, coming at ten seconds
_,,, the ﬁrst period, came off the
sticks of linemates Charly Hagins
and Rick Vernon. Captain Hagins
zipped a pass back from the faceoff
circle to Vernon on the blue line.

Vernon muscled his way through a
crowd of St. Francis defensemen
and get 2a quick wrist shot away.
Browne, planted near the side of
the net, plucked the puck out of the
air and guided it into the net.

Coach Len Barcalow removed his

\":Goals Incorporated” line minutes

p

later, replacing it with Bill Gedeon,
Chuck Crisanti, and Val Troy.
Defenseman Russ Stump’s blast
from the left point beat St. Francis
goaltender Jon Novak.

But the shot was knocked in with
a high stick, so the goal was
disallowed and the faceoff came
behind the blue line. Crisanti
connected on the next play to score
at 2:45dfrom Troy and Gedeon.

Sophomore Rick Vernon broke in
on the St. Francis not all alone,
with ﬁve Frankies and his two
Panther linemates skating frantic-

sisted goal came at 5:14 to make it
3-0 Pitt. 1

Pitt goalie John DeFazio, partially
screened by his own defensemen,
let one in at 7:25 of the ﬁrst period.
He made a big save on the next St.
Francis try, a point blank shot that
got through the crowd of skaters,
and calmly batted away another
shot that crept into the Pitt crease.
The three shots represented the St.
Francis total for the period. ,

A partial defensive charge netted
a goal by Hagins from Browne and
Mark Weaver at 12:21 to end the
De-

\’fenseman Mike McDermott made a

high-flying hip check on St. Francis
forward Bob Zahurak in front of the
team benches at 13:54 as he broke
in alone on the Pitt goal. McDer-
mott received’ a tripping minor in
the only penalty of the period.

St. Francis opened the second
period with a goal after their power
play expired. Center Paul Fischi-
one pushed and shoved at big Dave
Zieglar in front of the Panther goal,
and the puck psnuck in behind the
two and past DeFazio. A

Pitt, or rather Denny Browne,
came back roaring, as the senior
left wing skated into corners and
around the St. Francis net for three
goals in succession. His hat trick,
in the true meaning of the word,
came from two unassisted goals
and a pretty pass from "Vernon.
The score: St. Francis 2—Browne
4.

Crisanti, skating on a sore leg,
collided with the St. Francis goalie
and they both went down in the
crease. Crisanti got up, only to
receive a misconduct at 12:53 of the
second period. '

Wingers Bill Gedeon, now playing
without his center Crisanti and
linemate Jeff Saunders (suspended
for the league game for ﬁghting
last week against St. Vincent),
clicked on a makeshift line for a
goal at 14:23.

A third period power play opened
up the ice, for Pitt’s Browne, who
bottled up the puck in the St.
Francis end and picked off a pass
from Hagins at 4:51. Browne’s
ﬁfth goal of the night made it Pitt
9—St. Francis 2.

Bill Gedeon split the St. Francis_

defense, deked a Frankie forward
who was out of position, and riﬂed
a pass to Vernon. The goal at 6:06
preceded a mirror-perfect play at
10:12 in which Vernon dropped a

. pass for Val Troy. ‘The two moved
in on goal together, and Troy
dumped the puck in to make it 11-2
Pitt. *

Again Gedeon skated for a, break-
away and scored at 13:09 of the
final period. The St. Francis team
was two men short in the final
minutes of the game as they picked
up minors for high sticking ‘and

tripping. Pitt’s third line couldn’t~

move fast ‘enough to take advan-
tage of the situation, and the game
would have ended 12-2 but for the
efforts of Gedeon and Browne. The
buzzer sounded at 15:00 to end the
game just as Gedeon’s shot left the
ice. The goal was good, Gedeon
‘ got ‘his hat trick, and Browne
picked up. his eighth point of the

The Cocks continued to retaliate
primarily with the bomb and again
knotted the score at 60 apiece. But
Hill quickly added another lay-up
at the four minute mark for th
62-60 lead. '

The next few minutes - were
insane, partly because of the’
cheers of the 11,714 fans who were
practicing swinging from the
rafters of the Coliseum and partly
because the officials lost their cool
in the heated struggle. '

  Loss To Gamecocks Big l.eIcl o

The Cats held the ball with three
minutes left when. Tom Boswell

fouled Keith Starr, giving the
junior playmaker a one-and-one
situation. But Starr failed to
connect and the Cocks: gained the
ball.

Davis then proceeded to insult the
high quality of play which the two
teams had exhibited all evening by
tossing an 18 foot baseline shot
toward the hoop. Defying all
reason, the ball hit the corner of the
banking board and somehow
managed to fall through the net,
tying the score at 62-62.

But the Cats still had a chance to
win the game and stayed with the
weave that had put them in front.
Unfortunately, the Cats were
bullied into a turnover by English
with about a minute and a half left
and the Cocks decided to give Pitt a
taste of their own medicine.

Clarion Ste ps Pitt 2

BY ANDY BEHREND

Pitt’s powerful wrestling team
pushed nationally ranked Clarion
State to the limit Wednesday night
before ﬁnally succumbing, 23-19,
in the Eagle’s «lair.

The Eagles, placed 18 currently in
the polls, jumped off to a 4-0 lead
based on Pete Morelli’s 16-6 su-
perior decision over freshman Ke-
vin "Nellis in the 118 pound class.

It appeared as if Pitt could chop
the lead to one point, as Fuddy
Bryant was inching away from

Clarion’s Tom Turnbull in the 126 -

bout. But, with 6 seconds left in
the ﬁnal period, Turnbull scored a
takedown to climax a 6-6 draw.
Randev Stottlemeyer gave the
Panthers their ﬁrst win of the

evening, decisioning Gary Price,

8-5, to put the wrestlers down by a
tally, 6-5.

One of the country’s ﬁnest col-
legiate grapplers, Don Rohn, a
former NCAA champ, pinned Pitt’s
Bill Korth at 1:34 of the third
period to stretch Clarion’s lead to
12-5.

Anchored by a takedown in the
last thirty seconds, Bob Davis eked
out a 7-5 victory over Skip Bolin,

‘ widening the gap to ten points.

It remained that way after the
next match, as John Chatman and
Sam Baird fought to a 10-10
deadlock. Pitt’s Chatman took a
5-1 lead intothe last period, but
Baird put on a furious rally, scoring

nine points toearn the draw.

Possibly the brightest spot in the
Pa_nther’s disappointing loss‘ was
the performance of sophomore
George 0’Kom. Down to 167, he
pinned Gene Higgins at 3:43 of the
match, for his ‘second consecutive
pin in as many varsity starts,
making it 17-13 Clarion, going into
the last three matches.

Bill Bailey threw his teammates
back into the match with his ﬁrst
period pin over Clarion’s Chris
Cole, at 1:59, putting the team
score at 20-19, Clarion.

Carl Roba stalked all over All-
American Chuck Coryea, but came
away on the short end of a 6-1
decision, in a match closer than the
ﬁnal score indicated. Coryea
stalled successfully without warn-
ing from the referee, and earned
five of his six points in one brief
span.

“I’m very unhappy,” said Coachi

Dave Adams. “I thought we
should have won the meet. We
didn’t wrestle up to our potential,
and as a team we just were not very
sharp.”

Asked whether he thought Pitt
would have jumped into the na-
tional ranking had his squad upset
Clarion State, Adams said unhesi-
tatingly, “I have no doubt we
wouldn’t have. But we have four
more matches left until tournament

time, and I know by that time we’ll-

be raising cain.”
. The loss dropped.Pitt to _a 5-3 log,

~ while Clarion State is now, 12-4.

  February:  1975

       

seconds left Boswell, who had 14
points, tried to go to the hoop but
his shot from about ﬁve feet was
partially deﬂected by Bolla and
careened off the boards into the
waiting hands of English who put
the Cats away with an easy tip-in.

The game was about even in all

‘departments except the rebound

department which went to the
Cocks 45-30. Unfortunately for the
Cats, Larry Harris suffered a

bruised knee in the ﬁrst half and '

was forced out of the game
weakening the Cats inside
strength.

But the Panthers put on a ﬁne
show in Columbia and have nothing
to be ashamed of. It now appears
that they have truly come into
their own because two months ago
the Gamecocks would have un-
doubtedly beaten them by ten or
more points. The tournament bids

are still up for grabs and the Cats ‘ 5'

continue to strengthen their shot at
a place in the play-offs.

Gymnasts

Face Navy
Tomorrow  

BY JIM SPANOS
On the strength of their
all-around men, the Pitt gymnasts
will again be striving for their ﬁrst

victory of the season on Saturday. .

The Middies of Navy are their
guests in a 2:00 meet, and by all
indications the meet will be an
even, rugged contest.

The Navy squad’ will be paced by
Mark Lambright, an all-around

man who has been scoring 43-

points per meet; Walt Sparky,
scoring 45 points per meet; and
Dave Brady, contributing 42 points
in competition. .
- As a team the men from
Annapolis have been scoring 184

points, and this is an optimistic"

sign for the Panthers, who have

scored 191 and 184 points,

respectively, in their last two
outings.

“It’s going to be like a volleyball
game,” head coach lg Perez

believes, in reference to the fact '
that each team will win certain’

events and the lead will change
hands often. .

“It should be’ the most exciting
meet thus far this season,” Perez
also noted, because “We’re not the
underdog anymore. Now we’re in
the ranks.”

Pitt has jumped into the ranks by
coming within four points of

defeating Massachusetts and by‘

scoring 184 against Cornell in

back-to-back contests last week-‘

end.
_ The question now is whether the
Panthers can maintain that kind of
momentum against Navy, and the
two biggest question marks will be

‘ Pitt’s sophomore all-around men

Rob Pasterick and Gus Papantonio.
Both have had problems staying
healthy. '.

Pasterick, who is third in scoring '

in the Eastern United States in the
all-around, injured his leg on his
dismount against Cornell and
hasn’t been tumbling in practice
this week.

Papantonio, has jumped from a 35
point average a year ago to a 42
point performance this year, but
has been bothered by a back injury
throughout the season.
