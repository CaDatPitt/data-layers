Regular Edition

National Hookup To Carry
ll/ien’s Debate With Stanford

 

Radio Event Features
Active Collegiate,
Local Season

By Herbert Rackoff
The University men’s debating team
will debate against Stanford Univer-
sity over a nationwide hookup of the

National Broadcasting Company in
January, Israel L. Goldberg, C36,
me11’s intercollegiate manager, an-

nounced yesterday.

The University team will defend the
afﬁrmative of the question; “Resolved.
that Congress shall have the power,
by two-thirds vot.e, to override the de-
cisions of the Supreme Court making
legislation of Congress unconstitu-
tional.”

Each team will be composed of two

men, and the time allotted for the

debate will total 45 minutes.
Though the date has not been deli-
nitely chosen as yet, preliminary try-

outs will be held Monday, November,
problem to be overcome, not merely

25, in Room 308, Alumni Hall during
the regular ‘ﬁfth hour debating meet-
ing. The debaters for the contest
with Dartmouth College on December
12 will be selected at this tryout, but
Goldberg stressed the fact that the
team to meet Dartmouth would not
necessarily be the same as that which
will speak against Stanford. Final
tryouts for the Stanford debate will be
held early in December.
Have Been on Air Before

Although University teams have
spoken over the radio from New York
City, Syracuse, Philadelphia, l\'~ash-
ville, and Miami in the past three
years, the Stanford debate will mark
the ﬁrst time the debating team has
spoken over a nation-wide hookup.
The Stanford team will speak from
Los Angeles, California, and the Uni-
versity team from Pittsburgh.

This broadcast debate will mark the
highlight of a season which provides
for a trip through the Southwest late
in January and a journey into the
East in April.

Besides these contests away from
home, Goldberg; has arranged an at-
tractive local schedule, providing for
debates -in P,itts:bu1'gh,,with, teams

from Oberlin" College," Alleglfeiiy Col‘-”

lege, Tulane University, University of
California, New York University. Uni-
versity of Florida, and University of
Cincinnati.

Frank Doeringer, C36, men’s local
debate manager, is working upon an
int.1'amural and ‘extension program
which features the usual large num-
ber of debates on and off campus.
Speakers in these debates will argue
the pros and cons of socialized inedi-

cine, and the overruling of the Su-'

preme Court.

Meetings of the Men’s Debating As-
sociation are held each Monday dur-
ing the ﬁfth hour in Room 308,
Alumni Hall.

Seidle Compiles
Activities Report

Positions Reveal Wide Variety;
Few Extra Points Are Carried

A greater distribution of positions
of authority in ‘University activities
this year than last is indicated in a
report issued by N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the "dean of men, to the
effect that only six students have pre-
sented petitions to be permitted to
carry more than ten activity points
this semester.

Of these six, ﬁve have been granted
in full, while the other was granted
with reservations. The ‘men whose
requests have been granted are VVil-
liam Harvey, C36; Stewart McAwley,
BA36; Joseph Rodgers, BA36; Israel
Goldberg, C36; and Russell Connolly,
C36.

“High man” is Goldberg, whose nu-
merous activities have amassed for
him a total of 18 points. Besides be-
ing managing editor of The Pitt News,
he is manager of the debating squad,
a member of the Student Faculty As-
sociation, and president of Pi Tau
Phi, honorary scholastic fraternity.
It was necessary for Goldberg tore-
linquish the treasurership of Sigma.
Delta Chi, professional journalistic
fraternity.

Rodgers, second in ‘points, also has
a long string of responsibilities. He
is a co-manager of the football team,
president of Phi Kappa, a member of
the Interfraternity Council, and also
an SFA member. .

The positions of co-manager of the
grid squad, treasurer of Pi Kappa
Alpha, and comptroller of the Panther,
have given 'McAwley a score of 14
points.

Harvey, who is president of SF_A,
member of Interfraternity council, and
president of Delta Tau Delta, ranks
fourth with 13 points.

The editor of the Panther, Connolly,
is two points over the regulation limit.
Besides his journalistic activity, he is
the president of ODK, honorary ac-
tivities fraternity, and a member of
the Cap and Gown Club.

The point scale system is adminis-
tered by the Point Scale Committee.
Points are allotted on the basis of the
work and responsibility entailtﬁl by
the various positions. ‘No student can
carry more than 10 of these activity
points without special permission
from the committee.

231 Attend First
Luncheon Session
Of Campus Chest

Dean Moore, Biddle Seek Funds
For Necessary Work; WSGA
Cites Increase In Loans

Two hundred and thirty-one student
and faculty members of the Pitt Cam-
pus Chest drive committee opened
their campaign for $12,000 at a cafe-
teria luncheon in the Memorial Hall
Banquet Room on Wednesday.

Student subscriptions are being so-
licited by both personal and class ap-
peals as the drive enters its third day
of campaign, today.

Dean High Moore of Trinity Cathe-
dral expressed the key-note of the
project‘at the luncheon meeting. He
challenged the students to “accept the

to be faced. Don’t take it as a duty,
but rather enjoy doing this work!”
he concluded in his short address.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, presented the attitude of the
Administration as one of “approval.”
He stressed the duty of every student
to subscribe: “First, participate, then
ask others to do the same.”

In answer to the question “Why
should" we (students) have a part?”
Biddle pointed out that the student
is accepted as an adult person at the
University. Therefore, a sacriﬁce of
this kind should be quite necessary
under these conditions.

Concluding, he termed the drive
“True service to the University.”

In the opening talk, Ruth Anderson,
Ed3='-5, pointed out the strong points of
a Student Loan fund. “Over $5,000 in
loans aided 56 women and 34 men dur-
ing the past year. Twelve hundred
dollars have already been loaned to a
male majority this year. VVith appli-
cations for an additional sum of $600
at this early date, it is necessary to
obtain more money.”

The student loan fund has three
sources of revenue: _the lunch stands

,in_t,h_e, Cathedral and Thaw hall; the

Community Fund drive; and interest
and principal ‘ on loans.

James Eichelberger, C38, presented
the Ylvl-YV\7CA situation, offering
three strong points in favor of these
organizations. “First, no other or-
ganization can show the true signiﬁ-
cance of college life. Also, the Y-pro-
grams are ‘by and for’ the students.
And, the program is expanding.”

Over 30,000 students attended

Te Ata To Sing,

Dance, Interpret,
Indian Legends

Princess Te Ata, for whom fourth
hour classes will be suspended today
for a University assembly, has an
enviable reputation on the lecture
stage as an interpreter of her native
songs, dances, and legends.

It has been said that only an Indian
can give the necessary inﬁection to
his monotoned chant. Te Ata, whose
uaine means “Bearer of the Morning,”
is a college graduate who has de-
voted her life to the preservation and
interpretation of her native folk-lore.

In this work she has been assisted
by Kuruks Pahetu, “Lone Bear,” a
Pawnee boy from Oklahoma who fur-
nishes accompaniment for her songs
and dances. ',

Pahetu will also offer a few vocal
numbers. As a protege of Madame
Sembrich, he studied voice at Juilli-
ard’s studio in New York.

The Princess is not a stranger in
Pittsburgh, having appeared here be-
fore the women students at Leaders’
Institute. _

Freshmen and sophomores may re-
member her program, which was pre-
sented in several high schools in the
city a few years ago under the aus-
pices of the Frick Commission.

A full-blood Choctaw, she is the
wife of Clyde Fisher, director of the
American Museum of Natural History.

SFA Undertakes
5th Hour Removal

Assembly Will Attempt To Secure
Group Opinion By Campus Poll

 

Student Faculty Assembly moved
to act immediately upon the possibil-
ity of eliminating" ﬁfth hour classes at
its meeting in Room 801, Cathedral,
Tuesday.

Upon the motion of Betty Glass,
C36, SFA agreed to contact all organ-
i7.ations on campus by means of a
form letter listing the pros and cons
of this action. Individual polls wit 1-
in each group would‘pr'ovi'de ‘the 7) st
method of tabulating concerted stu-
dent opinion, the assembly agreed.

After discussion of the report of
Alan Lloyd, C36, men’s editor of the
Pitt Compass, University Handbook,
the motion was passed to have the
handbook editor hereafter selected by
the publications board at the same
time as the other editors and business
managers, and to have the position
open to competition.

Information concerning the where-
abouts of the committee on commit-
tees was requested by Miss Theresa
Kahn, instructor in the English de-
partment. Israel Goldberg, C36,
claimed that he had never been noti-
fied of his chairmanship to that com-
mittee and explained that its inactiv-
ity was caused by a superﬂuous scat-
tering of authority.

It was later revealed that the com-
mittee had met and made decisions,
but that Vvilliam Harvey, C36, presi-

-dent of SFA, had not asked for them

because they were not representative
of the entire committee. A motion
made by Charles Ebert, C36, to have
these decisions made public anyway
was not permitted by Harvey-.

The next SFA meeting will be held
on December 10.

Freshmen, Notice!

All freshmen who have not yet
been examined a.t the Falk Clinic are
requested to attend to the matter at
once. They should all be examined
by November 22.

 

   

 

Dance Tomorrow
Night Concludes
Regional Meeting

General Student Body Invited;
Publications Staff Members
Sell One-Dollar Tickets

There’s a dance tomorrow night at
the Hotel Schenley, ostensibly in
honor of more than a hundred dele-
gates expected for the convention this

week-end, of the Intercollegiate News-
paper Association.

The delegates will be recognizable
by the badges and blue ribbons adorn-
ing their persons.

Word was given out recently that
a few members of University publica-
tions could buy tickets and attend the
affair, mix with the ﬂower of eastern
collegiate journalism and share some
of the honors accruing to the guests.
The end result around Room 709,
Cathedral, the activities wing, indi-
cates what convention guests will be

fa.r outnumbered by paying‘
guests, as it were. Now it appears as
if the affair were in honor of the

slaves who work away all year on pub-
lications here, their relatives, friends,
fraternity brothers, and of those who
muddle about in other activities, with

the convention delegates invited to
come if they so wish.
Tickets, priced at $1 per couple,

,have been ﬁnding a ready market
among students here, and now there
may be two student couples for every
(lelegatecouple.

Garvin’s Orchestra to Play

The whole thing doesn’t seem to
bother Charles B. Holstein, 36, dance
chairman, and his business manager,
Harry Robinson, C36. Resigned to
the fact that the dance will be a“suc-
cess, they have nonchalantly allowed
committee assistants to sell more and
more tickets.

Which doesn’t mean that the ball-
room will be too crowded for dancing.
A limit has been set at 300 couples.

Val Garvin’s Coral Cove Orchestra,
a popular eleve11—man unit which has
played for innumerable campus and
fraternity affairs here, will open the
dancing at 10 o’clock with a special
arrangement of “Stardust.”

About 50 young women at the Uni-
versity have been designated as offi-
cial hostesses at the dance.

Those dollar tickets may be pur-
chased throughout the day in Room
709, Cathedral, in the dean of men’s
ofﬁce, Room 801, Cathedral, and in
Alumni Hall from William Daufe11-
bach. They may also be obtained to-
morrow at the Schenley Hotel from
members of the convention commit-

_...g..« repre‘s‘entations from all Uni-
versity activities and fraternities are
expected.

INA Dance Tickets

All committee assistants sell-
ing tickets for tomorrow night’s
INA-Publications dance will re-
port to Harry Robinson, C36,
business manager, in The News
oﬁice, Room 709, Cathedral,
some time this afternoon. Money
should be turned in at this time.

Greatest Engineering Feat Of Semester
Will Attract Hundreds 1o Grotto Tonight

Engineer No. 1

Edward Shepherd

HAIRMAN of‘tonight’s Engineer-
ing Association dance, leads about

400 T-square men and their ladies in
a concerted drive on the Grotto Ball-
room. It’s informal, but no corduroys.

Baron Elliot’s Orchestra
To Hold Plumb Lines-
For Dancing Duos

Dofling their brown suede jackets
and taking the mothballs from the
pockets of their “Sunday Best” suits,
the engineers are busy grooming

themselves for their Fall classic, the
Engineering Association Dance. They
are preparing this early because the
dance takes place this evening from
nine to one at the Grotto.

There will be no grand march for
Frances O’Loughlin, a senior at
l\'Iouut Mercy College and Edward
Shepherd IE36, “king of the prom.”
However Baron Ellidtt might lend
them his baton so that they can at
least lead the orchestra.

Elliott, who is playing the affair,
promises to. have Roselle Bayne, the
young lady who sang on his last two
broadcasts, and Mickey Ross present
as vocalists.

Tickets which cost one dollar ca.n
be obtained in Room 801, Cathedral;
in Room 101, "Thaw Hall; from junior
representatives; from all cabinet
members and also at the door. These
tickets will enable the purchasers to
attend the smoker on January 9, as
well as the dance.

100 Will Receive
Freshman Awards

Bronze Plaques To Be Presented
At Special Ritual Meeting

Bronze plaques, bearing the seal of
the University, will be distributed
next Friday to more than 100 fresh-
men at a special ritual meeting in the
Memorial Hall Banquet Room called
for 12:30 o’clock.

At this meeting, which all fresh-

men are required to attend in order

recognition will be made of the extra-
ordinarily deserving conduct of cer-
tain members of the Class of 1939.

Upon the recommendation of their
upperclass and faculty counselors,
the freshmen are referred to the cus-
toms committee, which rates them as
to activities, scholarship, spirit, and
general desire to cooperate with the
customs committee.

The plaques are mounted upon a
mahogany base, and, in the opinion of
Charles Herald, C36, chairman of the
customs committee, they “are an ap-
propriate reward for things accom-
plished, and should make permanent
the work which the customs commit-
tee and the freshmen themselves have
done.”

Here Come The Journalists

HEN THAT FELLOVV Johannes Gutenberg
long ago lifted from his press the first
printed page, he couldn’t have had any idea
of what he was starting. Even his most fantastic
dreams certainly did not include the picture of
more ‘than 100 college undergraduates coming
from miles around to converge upon one particular
campus in an atttempt to air their problems of the
printed page.

 

A gathering such as the Intercollegiate Newspa-
per Assoc'iation’s convention here this week-end,
attracting not only a large group of collegiate
journalists, but civic leaders and outstanding rep-
resentatives of the professional press as well,
proves conclusively that college journalism is :-nuch
more than a. plaything for enterprising activities
men and women.

It ’s interesting to note that college delegates to

journalism conventions come around for iioinething
«' ' .-.' 1

other than the promised good time. 'lhe under-
graduate representatives seem to get a wholesome
kick out of swapping problems of inake-up, news
coverage, and how t.o write editorials at the print
shop just half an hour before the forms are
locked up.

The Pitt News and everyone on the Pitt campus
extends aihearty welcome to the visiting delegates
and hopes that the week-end will not only be
“big” but proﬁtable as well. Then on Sunday
morning the journalists may go home to their re-
spective colleges and universities to put out better
papers than ever before. Delegates from The Pitt
News will not even have to go home.

The radio public shouldn’t complain that the
University athletic authorities have found it inad-
visable to broadcast football games. Instead, we
put our debating team on the air over a national
hookup.

‘War And Peace’
Absorbs Inquiry

Panel Members, Dr. Parrish Say
Students Should Be Concerned

If students because of one reason
or another are the persons who will
be in the front line trenches in the
event of war, it is “eminently ﬁtting
that they should have something to
say about it.”

So explained Dr. VV. M. Parrish,
professor of public speaking, in open-
ing the panel discussion on war and
peace at Inquiry Forum VVednesday.
Although it was perhaps on the side
of under-statement in the minds of
some, Dr. Parrish’s remark appeared
thoroughly in line with what the
speakers on the panel felt on the mat-
ter.

The students on the panel were:
Edwin Banks, graduate assistant in
political science; Miss Genevieve
Blatt, graduate assistant in political
science; Sara Reish, C36, president of
the Women’s Debating Association:
Phil Gundlach, C36, president of Pitt
Riﬂes; and Joseph Fillner, C38, mem-
ber of Student Alliance. Each of
these individuals -expressed his own
opinion, and it must not be construed
that they spoke for the organization
or group to which they happened to
be aﬂiliated.

The general sentiment of the panel
was that the League of Nations had
not proven to be the effective agent
for peace that it was hoped it would
be just after the war. Banks, how-
ever, expressed the majority opinion
that, “If the League can come out on
top in this present crisis, it will in-
augurate a deﬁnite move for world
peace.”

Passing The Buck
In. order to bring out valuable senior opinions, the
Lehigh “Brown and White” has instituted the “tag let-
ter” 111 its columns. At the end of his letter the senior
names another member of his class who is to write a
letter for the next issue of the paper.

Faculty Announcement

Students at Columbia reversed the tables and gave
the faculty an intelligence test. The tests, conducted
by the Spectator, campus newspaper, indicated an aver-
age mental age of 20.

And You’?! Be There...

But none of that top hat, white tie, and tails stuff tomor-  
row night at the Schenley Hotel when the Publications boys
and girls and the Convention boys and girls join in at the big
buck dance. It ’s all quite informal.

Dancing to Val Garvin, meeting all those sweet gal dele-
gates and those handsome gentlemen delegates at the INA-
Publications dance, YOU’LL BE THERE—if you’re smart.

The flower of collegiate journalism in the east will be on
hand for this convention, and gorgeous and smooth delegates
from 35 member INA newspapers are looking forward to a
good time at Pitt.

Not only that, but staff members of all

University publications have taken up the affair as THEIR

Did you ever cover a beat—or think about covering one——
for The News? Has The Panther ever run any of your humor

items? Have you ever worked on The Owl? If so, you’re eli-

gible for admission tomorrow night. Even if your only con-

tact with publications has been insertion of your name once
or twice, you’re still eligible. Besides that, if you have a dol-
lar, come regardless of any previous condition of publications
servitude, and there’ll be no questions asked.

You’re expected at 10 o’clock tomorrow night. Every-
body meets at the Schenley Hotel.

Val Garvin’s Coral Cove Orchestra is composed of no
bunch of slouches. Without doubt it ’s the best band you or
anyone else ever heard for a buck.

Those dollar tickets are available most anywhere on cam-
pus——hordes of willing publications members have them for
sale. Failing any other place to buy one, a.nnoy Miss Mary
Milburn (everyone else does anyway), Winsome secretary in
the dean of niens office, Room 801, Cathedral, for one.

Cornhnskers, Panthers Meet
Tomorrow In Grid Feature

N ebra.ska.Has Not Scored Victory Over Pitt Since 1921;
Visitors Well Fortiﬁed With Veteran Material

 

Last Saturday there was something about a soldier which was

simply ﬁne for about three and a half quarters.

luge of scores from the Panthers.

Then came th.e de-
Tomorrow at the Stadium, there

will be a gang of big, bold Cornhuskers from Nebraska meeting the
Pitt boys; and, if their dreams come true, there may be something
about a Husker which is super-ﬁne at the end of the contest.

A crowd of approximately 30,000 is’

expected to watch the Panthers and
Cornhuskers renew a grid rivalry
which started in 1921 and will proba-
bly extend i11to the dim, distant fu-
ture.

Not since the inaugural meeting in
1921 has a Nebraska eleven ever re-
turned home with a victory over Pitt.
In the ﬁrst game held at Forbes Field,
t h e midwestern representatives
downed a much smaller Panther team
by a 10-0 count.

From that time on, the Pittsburgh
aggregation have held the whip hand,
beating the Cornhuskers on ﬁve occa-
sions and engaging in scoreless ties
on three other trips to the gridiron.
Triumphs were registered in alternate
years, beginning in 1927 and extend-
ing up until 1934. In 1927 the Pan-
thers won, 21-13; in 1929, the score
was 12-7; in 1931, the count was 40-0;
and in 1933, the Pitt eleven scored a
6-0 victory. Then last season, the 10-
cal team broke the record progression
of scoreless ties in even numbered
years by walking oif with a 25-6 vic-
tory.

Nebraska May Surprise

In practically every encounter some-
thing unexpected has happened. In
1931 the Cornhuskers came to Pitts-
burgh with an unusually strong team,
but a November tidal wave struck
them that Saturday afternoon as the
Panther backs galloped up a11d down
the ﬁeld for an easy 40-0 triumph.
Two years later, Nebraska, by reason
of the work of Sauer and Masterson,
held the Pitt outﬁt scoreless for three
quarters, only to be beaten by a for-
ward pass play from Shedlosky to
Nicksick into the end zone on the
fourth down late in the fourth period.

Last year Mike Nicksick and Izzy
l/Veinstock led a Panther uprising out
in Lincoln, Nebraska, to blast the
Cornhusker’s hopes with a 25-6 shel-
lacking.

Then. if history ever repeats itself
in a football way, the Huskers are
due to give the Blue and Gold eleven
an uncomfortable afternoon tomor-
row.

‘Watch Cardwell and Lanoue

Led by a pair of line halfbacks in
Lloyd Cardwell and Jerry Lanoue, the
visitors will present an almost entire-
ly veteran eleven. Bob Mehring, at
center. and Fred Shirey, at tackle, are
the only newcomers to break into var-
sity ranks this season, and even at
these two positions, Coach Dana X.
Bible can insert veterans.

Henry Bauer is the lightest man on
the starting eleven, weighing around
the 160-pound mark; James Heldt is
the heftiest, hitting the scales around
the 210—mark. Most of the other
Huskers vary in poundage between the
185 and 200 marks, and average about
6 feet in height.

Coach Sutherland will probably rely
on the same eleven that started
against Army.

John 'Williams, Cornhusker guard,
will act as captain for his club. The
game gets under way at 2 o'clock.

Greek Champions
Headed For Title

Phi Epsilon Pi Defeated By Delts
In Semi-Finals of Touch Play

Slashing its way over a water-
dren(-.hed ﬁeld, Delta Tau Delta slid
into the championship bracket of the
Interfraternity Touch Football Tour-
ney Vvednesday by wiping out the Phi
Ep title bid, 13-2. in a slippery semi-
ﬁnal struggle at the Schenley Oval.

Delta Tau Delta displayed the same
winning form that brought them the
cup last year. Neither the mud nor
the Vvolves could stop Duff and Hep-
burn as they led the Delts into the
ﬁnals with two touchdowns in the
opening minutes of play.

Two passes from Duff to Hepburn
put the winners in scoring position.
After two scoring attempts fa.iled, the
order was switched and Duff leaped
nn among three enemy players to snag
Hepburn’s heave behind the goal line.
Ralston’s try to convert the extra
point was wide. .

On the following kickoff, the Phi
Ens fumbled a lateral and Ralston.
who kicked off, pounced on the ball
on the Phi En 20-yard line. Duff
passed to Prichard and the Delts had
a ﬁrst down on the 3-yard marker.
Running wide around left end. Duff
flung a bulle..t-pass to Hepburn for the
score. Ralston made the extra point
this time and the Delts were protect-
ing a 13-0 lead before the ﬁrst quar-
ter had ended.

Phi Ep spirits were revived as the
second half began when a 15-yard
penalty for illegal blocking sent the
Delts back to their own goal line.
Attempting to punt out, Ralston fum-
bled and was nailed by three Phi Ep
linemen in the end zone for a safety.

There were no further scores nor
scoring threats, although Al Duff and
S01 l\./lenaker ﬂashed some pretty ball
carrying and Nate Hepburn continued
to catch the soggy pigskin with con-
siderable success.

Frosh, Varsity
Harriers Leave

For IC’-4A Meet

A Panther Cub squad departs to-
morrow with an inexperienced varsity
Jungle Cat for the fastest harrier
competition in the country, the run
ning of the annual IC4A cross-country
meet over the tough Van Cortland
Park course on Monday.

This marks the ﬁrst appearance of
a complete freshman team, represent-
ing the University of Pittsburgh, in
the yearling championship run.

Pitt's, Little Panthers boast a rec-
ord of six straight wins over the out-
standing high school and freshman
cross-country. squads in the tri-state
district. In addition to this unde-
feated string, the ﬁrst—year men will
shoot a runner-up Junior AMA title
at the ﬁeld in the national exent.

Pitt’s varsity has yet to be fairly
tested. Notre Dan1e’s ramblers
copped an early 25-30 decision over
the ﬁat, short South Bend course.
An undefeated Penn State lion es-
caped with a bare singe of the whisk-
ers as it extended a victory string to
nine straight at the expense of a limp-
ing Panther. Charley Groat was lost
through injuries for this meet.

Then, Olson’s club hit a winning
stride as it pasted a good Butler team
for a 23-32 licking. Last Saturday,
the Junior AMA title was swept aside
as Olson nursed his men back to full
strength.

Today, they look promising, but
la.ck in experience. Olson predicts a
pessimistic 10th, hoping, if possible,
to place within the select ten.

Edwin Beysey, a senior from Colby
in Maine, is the ruling favorite to cop
the varsity race. Beysey placed sec-
ond to the champion Tom Ottey of
Michigan State in 1934.

Michigan State should be pressed
this year for the team title by last
year’s runner-up Manhatten team, and
other strong squads from Rutgers,
Yale, Penn State, Maine, Dartmouth,
New York U., and Columbia, strength-
ened this year by the addition of
sophomores from the 1934 freshman
champions of the IC4A.

The following varsity members
make the trip along with Coaches
Olson and Potts: Harold Tost,
Charles Great, George Cook, Alex
Leggin, Franklyn Theriault, and‘Jack
Emens.

Freshman runners to accompany
them are: Woodruff, Filson, Zam-
borsky, Bonarati, Cogswell, and Tred-
ennick. Manager Claus will be the
15th member of the party leaving to-
morrow in cars for New York City.
The squad will stay at the Taft Hotel.

Miners Challenge Again

The Miners’ football team chal-
lenges all University football teams
(excepting Dr. Sutherland’s gang) to
play a straight football game with
them. Straight doesn’t mean that the

teams accepting are accused of any-

thing undercover, it merely intends
to limit the game to straight football
11ot the touch variety. All interested
see Bud Swoger in Room 1212, Cathe-
dral. This challenge is offered also
to fraternities.

Fellowship Awarded

Dr. E’. G. Meisel, professor of dental
pathology at the University School of
Dentistry was reelected trustee of the
American Dental Association at its
annual convention held in New Or-
leans recently.

The convention conferred a fellow-
ship of the American College of Den-
tistry upon Dr. J. S. Oartel, assistant
professor of histology here.

Varsity, Fresh

‘With only two weeks to go before
the opening game of the season, Dr.
Carlson and his varsity squad and
Dockey Kowallis with his freshman
crew have started basketball practice
in the Stadium pavilion. Both teams
open with the annual cage clinic at
the Stadium, December 7, meeting the
varsity and fresh teams of ‘Washing-
ton and Jefferson.

The freshmen started their drills
Tuesday with 40 ﬁrst-year men re-
porting for the team. Dockey Ko-
wallis, freshman coach, started the
boys off with the fundamentals of the
game a11d an explanation of Dr. Carl-
son’s famed cage system. Last sea-
son, it is remembered, Dockey wound
up with one of the best freshman
teams in years at the University, and
he aims to repeat this year.

Among the 40 players that reported,
a number of ex-high school stars are
found. Jack Scott who played for Mt.
Lebanon, Manny Hyatt from Schen-
ley, John Smith from Grove City,
George Lindsey of Avalon, Joe Fable
of East Pittsburgh, Bill Bradley from
North Braddock, Emmett Morrison
from Brookville, Ed Sobehart of Al-
legheny-, Bob Keene of Perry, and Ed
Lawry from Kiski are a few of the
boys who starred while in high school.

Manny Hyatt and Ed Lawry, as
might be suspected, are brothers of
two great stars who once played un-
der Blue and Gold colors. Charley
Hyatt, here several years ago, was
perhaps the greatest basketball. player
ever to play under Dr. Carlson.
Timmy Lawry also starred for three
years as a Panther forward. It should

be added, while speaking of relation-
ships, that the John Smith reporting
for the team is no relation to Miss
Pocohontas’ Johnny’ or to ex-Captain
Don.

The freshman squad will continue
practicing every day until its open-
ing game with the W. & J. yearlings.
By that time, Kowallis hopes to have
the team straightened out and ready
to start another season.

Meanwhile the varsity squad, with
Dr. Carlson as the genial master of
ceremonies, has been practicing for
several weeks. They-, too, are waiting
for December 7 and the W & J var-
sity. The varsity, however, has a
game before that, a scheduled prac-
tice game with the Akron Goodyear
five in Akron, November 30.

Three lettermen from last year’s
crack team are back this season. Ted
Roderick, the 1935-36 captain, Pete
Noon, tall center, and Bill Jesko re-
turn, to provide Panther opponents
with full-sized headaches. Ross 
rick, star sophomore guard on last
year’s ﬁve, and Ralph Ferguson, an-
other soph star, will not return this
season.

Their shoes will be ﬁlled by the
players coming up from the 1934
freshman team. Rags Radvansky,
Miles Zeleznik, Ed Spotovitch, Ollie
Lengyel are a few who are ﬁghting
for a ﬁrst string position.

Altogether, the genial doctor has 16
players on the squad. Aside from
those already mentioned there are
Joe Garcia, Bob Nickel, Bob Johnson,
Joe Urso, Ed and Jim Leech, Van
Jones, Luke Rowe, and Frank Loucks
on the squad. Faced with a tough 2'’-
game schedule, these boys should all
see plenty of action during the sea-
son.

Weber Will Address
Nationality Committee

Mr. John Weber, business manager
of the University, will speak on “The
University Building Program” before
a meeting of the members of the 15
nationality room committees, Monday
evening, November 18, at 8:15 o’clock
in the Cathedral.

Patrick Maintains
Lead In Scoring

Five Points In Army Game Keep
Fullback At Top In District

Frank Patrick, the crackerjack
Panther fullback, kicked himself ﬁve
points worth of scoring against the
Army Saturday to hold his lead in
that department over all district foot-
ball players.

The Pitt kicker’s fourth ﬁeld goal
of the season and two points after
touchdown boosted his total for the
year to 61. This represents a 3-point
margin over his nearest competitor,
Dick Jones of Geneva, a former South
Hills High School boy. Jones gather-
ed six points in an Armistice Day
game.

Bobby LaRue, smooth-running Pan-
ther halfback, scored more touch-
downs against the Army than he has
scored in all other games this season
together. Bobby counted three six-
pointers to bring his total up to 30
markers and give him eighth place in
the minds of the statisticians. LaRue
would no doubt be glad to offer his
teammate, Patrick, a few points for
assists in the halfback’s runs, but the
gridiron rules haven't yet come
around to considering such a move.

‘Mammy Tales’
To Be Recotznted
At Beaux Arts

You’ve read about them in books-
those old negro slaves who faithfully
remained with their masters even
after they were given their freedom.
According to Christine Rouse, G, who
comes from down South, they actually

 

- existed.

Miss Rouse’s earliest memories are
connected with tales told to her by
a negro Mammy who had also been
her mother’s nurse and whose family
had served the Rouse family from way
back when.

Some of these tales Miss Rouse will
recount at the Beaux Arts Salon Wed-
nesday. night, when the Womeii’s De-
bating Association and the Women's
Choral will entertain freshman women
and their senior mentors in a Heinz
House ﬁlled with pictures, pillows,
general artiiiess, and no chairs.

“What Happened to the Dogoshes”
and “How the Birds Got Their Color-
ing” are two of the stories that Miss
Rouse plans to tell.

The Mammy’s tales, Miss Rouse ex-
plains, took the place of the discipline
the Mammy was not allowed to ad-
minister in keeping the children in
order.

Miss Rouse was for three years a
member of the debating team at Mt.
Berry College, where she did her n11-
dergraduate work. For the last year,
she has been a graduate student here.

Her part in the Beaux Arts pro-
gram will be preceded by music sup-
plied by members of the VVomen’s
Clior__al and dance interpreting color.

“Camels are so smooth and mild
they never affect my wind,” says
Craig Wood, pictured at the right

Willie Macfarlane adds: “Camels
are mild. They don’t get my wind.”
Miss Helen Hicks brings up the
feminine viewpoint. “There's 21 del-
icacy of ﬂavor in Camels that ap-
peals to women. Camels never inter-
fere with one’s wind.” And Denny
Shute says: "I switched to Camels
years ago. I smoke them constantly,
without upsetting my nerves or dis-

turbing my wind.”
