tional Bridge Olympics. Wednesday

ters in the Cathedral. .

‘Male members of the faculty have
decided that they might want to lose
professional and masculine dignity
for the night; and well they might,
for they will be competing yvitl1Vabout_
250,000 of tl1e_.world’s best players
with agset pf specially‘ pre'pare_d ‘trick

Glen "Gray-V" Provides Music
For Annual Ball Friday
At William Penn

“Ycs,Vwe ha"Vvc no corsagcs.’.’ Out
of Fr.iday’s I11terfratcr_nity_ Ball com-
mittee came ‘the rumor that the Ball
would give corsa'ges as favors. No
substantiation was given to the ru-
mor and now the committee definite-
ly states that there will not be any
coitsages given away "as favors at Fri-
<lay’s dance. , ~ V A

Ben W. Baskin, C37, ’c11"airman of
the dance, made the following state-
ment as regarding the corsage rumor:

“The committee never deﬁnitely
decided on Corsages. Through some
error the unconﬁrmed rumor leaked
out without any authority. I hope
that ticket holders won't be placed at
any disadvantage.” . _

' _Advertising_ announcements, ticket
payments, and. all the tumult and
shouting which accompany prepara-
tions for the dance are practically
completed. "

-_All that remains now is for Glen
Gray and his "Casa Loma Orchestra
to arrive in town to play for the 565
couples who will attend Friday eve-
ning’s formal from 10. to 2 o’clocl<
in the grand ballroom oi‘ the William
Penn Hotel. ' ‘

Only exception to the unusual
versity “big name” dance of the year
is" the exchange of reservations for
tickets_ today. Exchange stands, where
tickets may be secured for two do]-
lars and a previously-purchased reser-
vation, will be open on the first floor
of Alumni Hall between class periods,
and in -the-dean of 1ncn’s oilicc,
Room 801, Cathedral, between 2 and

5 o’clock. No reservations will be ox— .

changed for tickets after 5.o’clock"
today. Chairman Baskin emphasized
that no one will be admitted to the
dance without a ticket secured in ad-
vance.

As always, decorations for the I-1“
Ball willbe something new this time.
Promises ch"a'irma"n‘Baskin: “'l‘l1is i.~.
going to be the first dance in Uni-
versity history to be completely dec-
ora'ted.” Plans include a replica of
the Parthenon’ at the entrance to the
ballroom,"a_nd.tlie pr_o"grams and other

When Jeannette Swartz, C38, and Lorraine Simpson, C39, bring
to a close their rebuttal speeches this afternoon they ‘will likewise
be concluding the year’s intercollegiate debating schedule of the

Women’s Debating Association.

Over radio station W WSW at 2 :45 o’clock Miss Swartz and Miss
Simpson will oppose a squad from the Bucknell University wom-

cn’s debating association.
debate on the question, “Resolved,
That Congress Shall Have the Power
To Regulate Maximum Hours and
Minimum Wages In Industry.”

In former debates this year, the
Association met Bates College at
Lewiston, Maine; George Washington
University; Pennsylvania State Col-
lege; Denison University; Ohio .Wes-
leyan University; University of Illi-
nois; Marietta College; University, of
Chicago; and Randolph Macon Col-
lege.

Return Engagement

This afternoon's debate will be
Bucknell’s return engagement, a Uni-
versity squad having opposed them on
the Lewisburg campus several weeks
ago." -In addition to the debating
schedule, representatives of the Asso-
ciation took part in the Second An-
nual Mock Legislative Convention at
State College. A ,

In comment.ing on this year’s ac-
tivities, Miss Theresa Kahn, instructor
in English and coach of the Debating
Association said, “We have tried to
carry out the highest objectives of a
forensic program. The students have
been given training in speech com-
position and delivery before various
types of audiences. The Won1e'ii’s_ De-
bating Association has carried them-

tellectual life of the campus to other

schools and in its extension program
has taken it to civic, professional,
and business organizations throughout
the community.” - — .
Emphasis on Discussions

- Miss Kahn explained that empha-
sis has been placed’ not on decisions
but rather upon discussion of perti-
nent questions for the sake of influ-
encing public opinion. Regular style
and Oregon style debates, along with
panel discussions and legislative types
of presentation, have been -used.
Members spoke before audiences com-
posed of high school students, college
students, Women’s clubs, and business
men's organizations.

Faculty Entertains
Parents Tonight

Business School Will Hold
First Special ‘Reception

 

For the first time in the history of
the University, the faculty of the
School of Business Administration
will hold an evening reception for
parents of students enrolled in that
school. The affair is to be held this
evening in the main ballroom of the
Schenley Hotel and begin at 8
o'clock.

In‘ past years it has beenthe cus-
tom of the University to hold a re-
ception for parents of the freshman
class, but after that ﬁrst meeting;
parents have no further opportunity
for personal contact with those teach-
ers responsible for their sons’ or
daughters’ education.

Therefore, Dean Charles S. Tip-
petts, in remarking on the purpose of
tonight’s meeting stated, “The meet-
ing is to be held as an attempt on
our part to discover a closer relation-
ship between parents and teachers
and to explain the work the school
is trying to do for the student.”

N o elaborate preparations have been
made for the event. -. It will be
opened with -_a speech by Dean Tip-
petts, in- which he .will discuss the

and also the purpose in assembling
the parents. Following theaddress,
parents will be free ‘to interview the
faculty members of the School of
Business Administration, all of whom
will be present. .
Private invitations have been sent
through the mail, but Dean Tippetts
requests that students ‘of the school
urge their parents to attend the meet-
ing this evening. . .‘

Fraternity Coeds
Prepare For Ball

Annual Panhellenic F orrnal
' Sclieduleclfor April  

Fraternity women are already con-
sidering formals and dates for their
big affair of the ‘season, the annual
Panhellenic Ballon April 16.

Larry Funk and his orchestra, well-
known throughout New England, will
furnish the music for the dance. Ma-
rion ‘Messer, Ed37, .vice president and
social chairman of Panhellenict and
chairman of the affair, has -arranged
to have the ball at the Urban Room of
William Penn.Hotel. : ~ --

Tickets have been given tothe Pan-
hellenic representative of each frater-
nity and the price of the dance is
three dollars. A quota of attendance
has been set at two-thirds of the ac-

've members of each groupiiistead
of the three-fourths quota of previous
years. ' ' *

The Panhellenic ‘Ball has always
been a closed affair and will probably
remain that way this year, although
the plan of opening the dance to non-
fraternity women has been considered.

Weclnssday, April 7, 1937
.

Congress, 

Senators and Representatives on
Washington’s Capitol Hill are conduct-
ing their own sit-down strike in pro-
test against the tactics of President
Roosevelt.

‘ At least that is the revelation pre-
sented to students at Inquiry Forum
Monday by Francis P. Miller, secre-
tary of the National Policy Associa-
tion speaking on the subject “Behind
the Scenes in Washington.”

Mr. Miller told-a small group that
this “legislative _sit-down?’ is there.-.
sult of an increasing tendency "on the

part of the executive to legislate with-~-

out regard to the wishes of Congress-
men. This opposition, * he" -‘ said, has
been brought to a climax by the Pres-
ident’s ‘recent prop'o‘sal7to alter the
Supreme Court. ‘ ~ ,
Calling this a “wholesale develop-
ment,” Mr. Miller explained that “the
legislators are tired of the way the
representative system has been utterly
gnored, the ‘niustfprograms, and the
coercive use of patronage.” As a re-
sult, he declared, “They have decided
not to do anything.” '

This, he said, is the reason why, in

the pastthree months, Congress has 
accomplished scarcely anything onfthe ‘-

 Tow

and -other important problems sched- .

matter of neutrality, farm —legislat,i'o-n,-

uled for action. “Congress,” he report-
ec , “is using every bit of its power to
counteract the President’s proposal.”

The speaker called the Supreme ?
Court proposal an “utter denial of the 

democratic process of formulating pol-
icy.” He added that it established. a
bad precedent, and that “the Presi-
dent will never get what he wants by
these methods.”  
Although he said that the Supreme
Court “has done a rotten job,” he de-
lared that M_r.'Rooseve1.t was in the
wrong in blaming exclusively the Su-
preme Court for setting up barriers
to progress. “The smart young men,”

he continued, -“who_'-drew up the laws,
are just as liable to error.”-

Although he expressed -the-belief
‘that the proposed Supreme Court .re-
form will pass Congress. eventually by"

13‘ 2-1 vote, Mr. Miller told the group

that it would engender such ill-will
‘hat chances ior getting good legisla-
ion "through in the -future ‘will be
small.« .. ‘
He called this President Roosevelt's
‘ﬁrst ‘major political ‘blunder.”" The
thief .executive,’.-he. averred, ..should
have proposed last fall a constitu-
‘ional amendment-.niaking it compul-

Sti1nulate_d by the tang of the great
outdoors, Coach Carl Ol:son’s varsity
trackmen have been_ prancing arou_nd
the Stadium for the past few days
as they make ready for a strenuous
spring session. They will start the ball
rolling down the cinderpath Saturday
-a_fternoon at the Stadium when ‘the,
third’ annual University Hantlicap
meet will be held. '

‘ iOlson led his track horde out into
the great open" spaces _(and the huge,
saucered Sta_d_i_um is ‘just that when
theregare only two coaches sitting in

.0 the stands that can hold 80,000) last

Monday when_ the first deﬁnite touch

of spring cameinfto the air.

" With this prosp_ective' entry list the

A i of ’ _  “Veterans _ » ,
 Retur_1_1_ing ‘to , competition again
this year are 22 ‘men . of experience’
in last year’s.l1andicaps. Spitz, _1VI-ason,
and.-Lasky" will be in the‘ 100—yard

dash; Mason, Cooper, and Thomas in

the.220-yard dash; Woodruif, Thom-

in the 440-yard dash; Lasky, Cooper,
and Ryden in the. hurdles; Filson,
Bonorati, Tost, Leggin, Cook, "and
.Wood1'uif- in the distance races; Dines
and Gerrety in the pole vault.

scratch. are Mason, Thomas, Wood-
rulf, Tost, Ryden, Lasky, Lewis, Ben-
nett’, Ohl, Routch, Bazyk, Taano, and
Gerrety. Woodrufl’ is going to give
away the most ground. He’s spotting

Set To Open

From" the cloistered _ conﬁnes of
‘Room S817, Cathedral, m_en’s lounge,
comes the annual call to celluloid
clouters. . . It’s just Irv Solow an-
noulicinggthe third all-University table
tennis tour_nament to begin April 12.

Those who have spent the wintry‘

evenings in front of S the "ﬁreplace
whacking a ping pong ball are now
give-11 the chance to let that training
serve a real purpose. They can enter
the. table. tennis tourney and. win a
medal. If they don’t win,'.a_t least
t.hey’ll'hav.e the uninterrupted oppor-
tunity to. do some real Hell-week
paddling, and noone; will feel the
worse for it. ‘ '

Right" below th-is story an entry

blank is printed. This means that the_
tournament wil1i_begin very soon. Mon-‘

day is the exact»:-stalifiligf date. Entries
must be returned by this Friday, April
9, at 11:30 o’clock. " i ‘ '

All entries already received without
pai_d_fees or free hours marked can-
not be considered. The instructions on
the blank must be followed rigidly.

In last year’s tourney there were
over 80 participants. This year, more
are expected. Table tennis, or ping
pong as it is called by the fraternity
men, is rapidly growing into the pro-
portions of‘-a major indoor sport. Na..-
tional. championsliips are conducted
each year in New York and there is
even a world title match.

This increased national interest has
been felt in this district. There isn’t a
fraternity house on the campus that
doesn’t have a table and the tables in
817 which serve as the official campus
courts are always ﬁlled.

Madden, one of the cou11t1'y’s top
college nc'tmen, has been hard‘ at
work all winter on the board court:
of Duquesne Garden, and isthe odds-

on favorite to win the tourney. Only-

the most surprising of upsets could
dislodge him from his top ranking.

But if Madden is upset, ‘there is
probably onlyone man who will do
it. He is Ralph Bald, tall gaunt ex-
Mt. Lebanon player, whose record is
only blemished. by defeats when he
has played Pitt’s captain. Thathc has

given Bob. some close calls goes a.

long way toward ‘predicting an excit-
ing match in the ﬁnal rounds.

A l{ristui:'ek, runner-up to Harry Wald
in tl1cVPittsbu1'gl1 public courts cham-
pionships last summer, is also reputed
to have something.on the ball. His
match with Madden in the semi-ﬁnal.-
should have a great deal of signifi-
cance in judging future appearances
of Mad(lcn.

All this speculation is made on the
‘as:-umption that all goes well, and
that no da,1'kIhorses emerge to over-
turn the f_a\'o1'ites in early rounds.
That ‘there nra_v be one, or a few, un-
covered mcniwho can turn this trick
is the main reason for this annual
spring tournament.

It belongs to Pitt now, after the
defeat. of Temple in the pla_v—oﬁ’s. The
e1l1g1'_avc_=1' will have to cliiael in the
name of the University of Pittsburgh
for the fourth time pretty soon. Dr-
Carlson has a luncheon "date with
Clarence, “Buddy”_ .O;verend, Tech
athletic d~irector,“and Tech’s coach
Maxie I-lau1'Iu_m this week, and Pitt's"
coach Wll‘l'be presented the ‘trophy at
that time. ' ' " ' '

Another tangible recognition of
honor won on the ﬁeld of combat is
soon to come Pitt’s way, too. Cap-
tain Billy Jesko will receive -a gold
medal for his selection on the. All-
Conference team; 

This r<_ystem of awz1r(ling medals to
the All-Conference playe-"rs as chosen
by the Associated Press was decided
upon at the last n1eo_ti1_1§2; of the Con-
ference policy (letc1'1nih-iii}: group.

It was agreed, also, thalz all players
in the past who have received this
honor will likewise be given medals.
This means that the mailman will
come with '21 batch ‘of eiglxt pat-ltages '

  Bad Boy

IT HASBEEN SAID recently with a good deal

. of truth that upon Mussolini hinges the peace
of Europe. By his actions in the Spanish situation
in the next _fcw weeks, most foreign observers be-
lieve, will ‘bedccided whether Europe goes to war
soon or not.

Until the advent of Adolph Hitler in 1933, Il
Ducé was the “bad boy” of Europe. With his vari-
ous ‘fairplancs darkening the face of the sun”
speeches and his pre-ernptory seizure of Ethi-
opia,  continually has been the man who has
sent jitters up and down the spines of statesmen
all over the world. And his actions in the Spanish
Civil War, even more, possibly, than the conquest
of Abyssinia, have brought on a recurrence of
crises, one of which if enough responsible states-
men lose their heads at the psychological moment,
wilhushcr in the much-written about, much-prc-
dicted second World War.

In the years preceding the World War it was
the Emperor of Germany who was the “bad boy.”
And a series of localized wars, a succession of
“diplomatic crises”, heralded the conflict.

Today, as in 1914, no one really wants war; but
it will probably take more intelligence and cour-
age to avoid blundering into than present. states-
men possess. Mussolini has staked his foreign
prestige on the outcome of the Spanish Civil War.
And the fact that the Loyalists are deﬁnitely on
top at the moment, have defeated Italian troops—
possibly not crack Italian troops—provides a situ-
ation which holds more than a more casual threat
to peace. _

Rabble-rouscr par excellence though he is, I1
Duce is a realist when it comes to politics and
diplomacy. He may stand on a classical balcony
and regale his hearers with tales of the glory of
the Roman eagle but he has proven time and
again that he is guided by real rather than emo-
tional motivations, that he follows a carefully-
planned program of action rather than jumping
headlong into something. Therefore, it seems
quite likely that, so far as he can help it, Musso-
lini will not go to war now because he couldn't
win—at least not if the war were a long-drawn out
affair and Britain were an opponent. Il Duce with
a good deal of quaint humor has tweaked the
British Lion’s tail, but it has been more or less
friendly tweaking, as though he were saying
“Don’t take this too seriously. I’m only having a
little fun.” And the British replied in more or
less the same vein.

But I] Ducc or some one else may unwittingly
go too far once, far enough that it might seem as
though more were to be lost by backing down than
by going through with the maneuver.

  Simile . . .

S YOU have perhaps noted by the way cer-

. _ tam heretofore casual acquaintances are so-

hcitously shaking your hand and inquiring about
your health, that election time is here again. Don’t
be disturbed, however, by their elTusiveness,gfor
its all a part of the game. Otherwise elections
would be like a ham sandwich without mustard.

"Der Angriﬁ,” German newspaper, commenting on La
Guardia affair: .

“We Germans demand that in dealing with us courtesy
be employed to which we have been accustomed for
2,000 years. This may seem strange and incomprehen-
sible to a people who have the habit of putting their
feet on the table and keeping their hats on in the room

while spitting chewing gum against the opposite wall.”

Stop, Look, and Listen

Be careful boy’s when you date any gal from
Pitt that she has no ('priva.te) connections with
another guy. Recently a boy from way up Barns-
boro way dated a lassie who was going pretty
regular with a Lambda Chi and he wanted to go
10 rounds to settle the fcud. . . .

We hope you all s-axed your Sunday -§un—1'ele-

society boy, Hank Sawin, the picture being talcen
at a recent hospital dance. Rose Nugent’s was also
 at the same dance but it did not find its
way into the paper.

Suicide

Our sympathy to Andy Ferguson, football
nianager, who didn’t miss a bank nite at the
Schcnley for oh so long. He went home over

v

I‘.'a.ste1' and his name was called for $150. . .
Along the same line, a few weeks ago while Ben
Iluskin was in an unp1*escntabl.c state, a. f1'ien(l
came down to the SAM house and told him he had
three minutes to go up and claim $150. Ben,
almost in the nude ran his darndesc to make it to
the Welland, and just as he arrived the manage-
ment was announcing how sorry they were that
the lucky number was not present so some one
else got Ben’s $150. What Ben told the
management is not printable in this paper, or
any other paper for that matter.

OOKING OVER THE political events of the last few
"months, it seems that since the election last November
to the present. time a gigantic political hoax has been
p-;1‘pet1‘atcd which up to now no one has quite caught
on to.

I re.fc1', of course, to the events which concern the
prosciit co11t1‘o\‘e1':sy surrounding the Supreme Court
proposal of President Roosevelt, and the attendant lack
of popular support which it*has sp far elicited.

Landslides and Dimwits

[MlvIEDLi&TELY AFTER the“November election cries

went up on all sides that unless some organized parti-
san opposition was furnished thetriumphant Democrats.
our free, nature institutions were in solemn—-nay! even
grave-——dunger of being trainpled underfoot in our na-
tive-—and inherently frce—-soil. .

For some time after this ‘the best. political minds of
the nation st1'uggled with the problem, and from their
probings ﬂowed a nu-13s of printed material which ponc-
trated to the far reaches of ‘the land. On all lnands
heads wag‘ged dolefully and murmured that some meum
must be found for resuscitating the Republican Party, or
some symbol thereof, in order that effective opposition
lniglrt be established to halt the Democrats in their
carccning path of glory—~or, at least, that they should
have parlianientary and paitisan opposition.

A chorus of voices throughout the land yea-yeaed the
sootlisziycrs and for a while little else could be heard
above their cla.mou1'ing——except perhaps, the billing and
the cooing of the delighted Democrats.

The Man-In-The-Street, as usual, was bewil_dered by
the sound and fury. The speeches of his leaders had
led him to believe that things would go to rack and ruin
unless he and the Faithful soundly squelched the Re-

publicans in the election. And like the Believer that ho

v.'a:_:, be gauged up on the Kansas sunﬂowers and
thumped them into vociferous defeat. In fact, the elec-
tion became rather an exaggerated counting of noses
that, to Republicans, were all touched with the same de-
gree of pinlzness. _

When victory was achieved, he settled back comfort-
ably to receive the plaudits that were rightly his. But
no plaudits were forthcoming. Instead, from his leaders.
he heard words that amounted almost to treason. He was
asked to organize some opposition to his party! Democ-
racy had indeed come to the Crossroadsll I '

lie was not a little troubled. Here he had been roused
to the task of obliterating the enemy and he had done
a neat job of it. But now his very leaders were saying
that what he had done was not entirely right. He had
done his job too well; * *

An Inhibited Vox Pop

 AND THERE IN certain mountain fastnesses

a Republican had survived the landslide, but such as .

that were counted on the ﬁngers of one hand. And all
the ones who had been slaughtered lay unburied on the
battleﬁeld. The benighted Democrat was now told that
he had to get busy and revive those that were not
quite dead. ’

It was almost too "much. It meant a complete reversal
of his mental macliinery. He was asked to give aid and
succcr to those whom he had not yet got over hating.
And the process of reversing his tactics, especially in
suclra critical moment as the relaxation after victory,
:'-ct up a debilitating interference in his mental make-up.
In short, he began to have inhibitions.

Ncilic, The Beautiful Cloak Model A

l\~.loanw_hile, behind the scenes :1 sini:‘ster movement
was gomg'on. The old opposition was quietly reforming.
and when the President launched his Supreme Court

_ proposal, the opposition burst out in a perfect ﬂood of
V (.'.l‘ll..l(tl.‘»'l11. It came from all augxles and all sides. But the ,

t.x'a_::cdy was halt a ,<:re;1.t part of it came from people
whom l"oo1‘ Average. I)cmoc.mt thought were on his
side. He was caught in 21 multitude of crossﬁres, which

victory he haul .'1Cl1l€V'G(.l. It was necessary that he snap
out of his doldrums, but he was taking a terribly long
time to snap out of them. ‘
And perhaps it is now too late.
