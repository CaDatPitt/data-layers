Proposal
Defeated ,  
ByBigVote

, Student Congress Monday
defeated the controversial
proposal to join the National
Student Association. '

The SC decision was made‘

in the light of a report by
Men’s Council President Ron-
ald Ecker that “lVIen’s Coun-
cil doesnotwant to join NSA.”

Adele Marriccini, «president of

_IWsGA,: also felt that while no.
vote had_been- taken by the wom-

en, the proposal would probably
fail there too. '
, Plugged by Reese .

Ross Reese championed’ the
cause of joining the national
group. He claimed that earlier
estimates ‘of costs of membership‘
approximating $800 were too high.
He said that $450 was _a more
reasonable ﬁgure. .

Contending that conferences and
leadership training were the real
advantages of membership in
NSA, Reeseiproposeda plan in
which Student Congress would
pay one half the local expenses
for joining, the remainder coming
from WSGA and Men's Council.
His only supporter in "the ﬁnal
vote was Marguirete Rawlings.

Still smarting from their .-.set-
back in trying to oust Don Mille-
t_ary from his position as student

imember of the‘ Athletic Commit-

tee, the legislators found out that
any hope of getting rid of him
was lost. '
Larry Adler, reporting on an
interview with Dean _Vincent
W. Lanfear, chairman‘ of the
Athletic Committee, said that
nobody, not even the chancellor
can remove a member from the
committee. . —

John Marshall Society
SponsorsForum T oday

John Marshall Society, college pre—law fraternity, will
sponsor a forum conducted by Brainard Currie, dean of the
law school, today in 1409 C1,, at 2:30 p.m.

“Which Law School?”, is the topic being discussed and

¢Dean Currie feels that it will be

of great importance to all students
looking forward to a career in law.
The purpose of the forum is to
point out and clarify features of
different law schools throughout
the country. ‘Information about
these schools will be available
since Pitt’s law school faculty con-
sists of people who have either
taught or studied at most of them.

According to ‘Dean Currie, the
forum will be informal and will be
thrown open to general discussion.

He added. that since the last pro-
gram of this nature many of the
people who attended have’ indi-
cated a desire for..; another such
discussion.

reality in an attempt to produce‘
brotherhood. . I

The Personal Level

I feel‘ that understanding can-
not be produced- on a‘ national
level or on a ‘state level alone,
but must, by the very nature of
man’s emotional instability, be
carried on on a very personal
level. FEPC is good! Non—dis-
crimination on transportation is
excellent but not enough. They
do not of necessity -produce un-
derstanding. They do, however‘,
produce acceptance. ‘Economic,

.. political and educational security

can be legislated. ' But if, as the
writer says, “Man, man is your
brother,’’ mere legislation is not
sufﬁcient, and the world‘ ‘has
much territory yet to conquer.
.Why should the world be in-
terested in conquering newlands
or invading new territory? Why
bother. with this idea of brother-
hood? Life won’t stop one. I
have a personal answer to that,

‘ one which isn’t based on’ scien-

tiﬁc reasoning nor upon statisti-
cal information. I feel that life"

Most New Dealers who associ-

little radical. They, and the ones
who actually ﬂirted with com-
munism, were long ago disillu-
sioned. There ‘is nothing more

~ Parallels -Noted
It appears, upon close exam-
ination, that Odets, in drawing
‘Bernie ‘Dodd and Georgie Elgin,
has returned to the proven

ground of his “Golden Boy” and

reincarnated, with minor vari-
ations, Tom Moody, and Lorna
Doone. The parallel between the
explosive, sentimental f i g h t
manager of Moody and the sham
bullying of director Dodd are
unmistakable; and the doom
could that hovered over Lorna
Doone now belongs to _G_eorgie
Elgin. I have no quarrel with
Qdets’ transplanting. He has

brought ‘both characters off ex- ‘

traordinarily“ well. The weak-

nesses of “The CountryGirl”i do I

‘not lie with its‘people.
. Although “The Country Girl”
is never in serious- danger ‘of

becoming a memorable evening --'

Probes, Coed IM
Athletic Merger

Leo Bemis, director-"of intra-
mural activities, said ‘Monday
that there is a "definite need for
a co-educational_IM program on

Pitt’s campus. This, along with S

other problems, will be brought
-before the newly-formed stu-
dent council for IM sports which
meets Wednesday, Feb. 25, at
Ellsworth Center. '

“With women participating on
the same scale as their male
counterparts, I believe interest
in all sporting events will be on
the uptrend,”.-Bemis stated.

The new student organization,

formed as an out-growth of a
.m_eeting called‘ Feb. -11 by Ath-
letic Director Tom Hamilton,
will have represeiitatives from
all student governing bodies,
athletic teams and professional
schools. .

This group of delegates will
act-as a committee to air prob-
lems, to determine policies con-
cerning IM competition,’ and ' to
set up an effective program to
bring more interest to IM ac-’
tivities. ‘ v

In the past,-similar councils
have been assembled but have
not been faced-with the female
counterparts.

Any Pitt student who has the
urge to learn the art of wrestling
and eventually challenge “Gorge-
ous” George or “Ruffy” Silverstein
will have an opportunity to start
training next Monday.

Wrestling Coach Rex Peery an-
nounced Monday that a wrestling
clinic will open Monday and con-.
tinue througli March ‘27_ at the

Army’s strong Cadets host

Saturday at West Point and from
all indications should. give Pitt
another rugged evening.

Coach Ben Grady’s defending
Eastern Collegiate champs have
now lost four straight dual meets
after opening the season with two
easy triumphs.

The slumping tankers will get
no relief this week either, as
Army is expected‘ to be even
stronger than the Navy squad
which was the latest‘ Pitt con-
queror, 54-30.

Only two more meets remain on
the Pitt schedule before the ECSA
but the Panthers can’t be counted
out‘ of the running.’ Although
they have lost their last ‘four, the
Pitt splashers have been improv-
ing their times with each engage-
ment. -1

Ronnie Gainsford, Eastern Col-
legiate titleholdef in the breast
stroke, swam his specialty in the
very fast time of 2:22.5 ‘against
the Middies for his best time this,
year and almost seven seconds
better than his time in last year’s

Players To Give Pittsburgh

By NANCY COOK_

A rousing adventure drama
of men at sea, “Billy Budd,”
has been selected as the next
P i t t Players presentation.
The March 19, 20 and 21 produc-
tion will be the Pittsburgh pre-
miere of the play adapttd from a
novel by Herman Melville.

An a1l—male cast of 18 will cre-
ate the picture of life on a British
man-of-war in the eighteenth cen-

- tury. The Louis 0. Coxe and Rob-
. ert Chapman dramatization of the

novel by the author of the classic
“Moby Dick” placed second as the
New York Drama- Critics’ selec-
tion for the best play of the 1951
season-
, “Good and Evil”

Good and evil come to grips in
the exciting sea story in the color-
ful naval days of Nelson and Na-
polean. Billy Budd, a young sailor

' of complete goodness, is incapable

of ﬁnding evil in other men. He is
impressed in wartime aboard a
ship whose Master.at Arms is as
clear a depiction of badness as the
boy is of good. _

- Mutinous Plans

Falsely implicated in mutinous
plans by the malevolent Master at
Arms, Billy accidentally kills his
accuser in a burst of rage. Con-
ﬂicting naval discipline and the
considerations of mercy and justice
are Weighed in the climaxing court
martial which decides Billy’s fate.

Director Harvey Pope will con-‘

duct try—outs today at 3:30 p.m.
in 351 C1.

Frosh To Pull M1.1SCl.eS’
With Upperclassmcn

Freshman men will match mus-
cles with upperclassmen in a tug-
of-war during half time at ‘the
Pitt—Tech basketball game tonight.
_ The purpose of the tugging is to
decide whether the fresh discard

 

their blue and gold striped ties or '

wear them for another week.
About 18 representatives from

the freshmen orientation groups

will oppose a similar number of

‘members of Druids, honorary ac-

tivities society for juniors, and
Omicron Delta Kappa, senior hon-
orary.

Junior who was, by
nature, 3 Grasshop-

of his time and en-

quently, while he was Right Up There

reached the Point of No Return.

Topping it off was an Ultimatum from the

either by a List of Passing Grades or a
Social Security Card. All Our Boy could see
ahead was a lifetime at Hard Labor, unless
Something Drastic happened.
