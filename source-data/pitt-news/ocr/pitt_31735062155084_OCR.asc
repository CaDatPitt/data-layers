SG Fight for Tax Cut

Penn State and the University of Pennsylvania have
notiﬁed Student Government that they have passed resolu-
tions petitioning the Governor and the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to reduce or remove the ﬁve per cent sales tax
on textbooks and school supplies. '

The schools followed SG’s lead after reading of the ac-
tion in The Pitt News, according to SG President John
Vrana. Penn State’s newspaper, The Daily Collegian, printed in full
The Pitt News editorial commending SG’s petition to spur on its
student government to similar action. " ” P

In a letter to John Vrana, SG president, Governor William W.
Scranton, governor of Pennsylvania, stated any action on the resolu-
tion would have to be taken by the state legislators, in its next full
session.

The tone of the letter deﬁnitely implied that the return of the
proper legislators to another term of office in this election would
enhance the chances of the passage of such a bill as the one recom-
mended by SG, Vrana explained. _

Jerry Hogan, president pro-tem of the Senate and author of the
SG resolution, said that “once the new session convenes in January,
SG will launch a full scale campaign directed toward acquainting the
members of the legislature of the need for this change in the sales
tax regulations.

“The co-operation of all Pennsylvania college students will be

Charles Bell Trio

By BARRY SHAW

Charles Bell, his trio and his son, kept the audience at
the PM series well-entertained Thursday night. Not only
was the trio a success itself, but when Bell’s son “Poogie”
tried his hand at the drums, many a music professor would
have encouraged more early admits at the University.

The Charles Bell Trio consisted of Charles Bell at the
piano, Tom Sewell on the bass, and Alan Blairman on the
drums. From the beginning it

Entertais at P.M.

 

 
 

was evident that these musicians
not only were technically proﬁ-
cient, but that they had a real
understanding between them.
Bell’s overall performance would
have been less successful had he
not been backed up by ‘such ex-
cellent accompaniment. Special
praise should go t:o Sewell, whose
quiet moments with the bass
were a welcome break, as he
moved up and down the instru-
ment, with a bow and without.

Probably the highlight of the
ﬁrst half of the program was
“How High the Moon,” an old
standard. Bell’s piano, which was
choppy at times, was much
smoother during this number,

due to his use of fuller chords.

‘, {But all ‘ the, music, in _ the first

half seemed inconsequential,
when “Poogie” sat at the drums.
Bell’s three-year-old son not only
charmed everyone because of his
age, but because he really could
beat to his father’s music. In fact,
Charles, Jr. at the drums really
served to highlight his father's
musicianship. Bell had to keep
one eye on the piano and one eye-
on the drums, to keep the two
well-coordinated. That the music
maintained its rhythm was due
to Bell, as well as his son.

After “Poogie” had played, the
Trio took over again, and closed

more exuberant fashion than the

way in which they had begun.

Barry Bowls ’

By ALEX D’IP'POLITO

A Wildly cheering audience
that completely ﬁlled the
13,000 seat Civic Arena and
overﬂowed into practically
all the aisles gave Senator
Barry Goldwater a warm
welcome as he lashed into
the Johnson administration’s
policies and outlined his own
views last Thursday night.

Goldwater praised Pitts-
burgh for the improvements
that it has made on its own
initiative and called it “one
of America's great cities.”

The GOP candidate criti-
cized President Johnson for
“how far this nation of ours
has drifted away from con-
stitutional government, away
from moral order, away from
peace, and away from free-
dom.

“We must stop the spread

of socialism at home and,

Communism abroad,” he add-
ed and gave these goals as
part of his reason for run-
ning for the Presidency.

“Do you want a man who
will spend and spend—and
borrow and borrow—and tax
and tax?” he asked his audi-
ence and they dutifully
shouted, “No.”

Goldwater said that the
President should “place na-
tional security before every-
thing” and promised an ad-
ministration that “will keep
the peace through a respon-
sible policy of strength and
high purpose.”

The senator cited the case
of Otto Otepka, who was re-
moved from his high State
Department position because
of his’ criticism of security
procedures, as an example of
a lax State Department.

BARRY GOLDWATER smiles for
the photographers as he waits to
take over the speaker's podium.
Goldwater's speech, as tallied by
a Pitt News reporter, was inter-
rupted by bursts of applause on
45 diﬂerent occasions.

Otepka, Goldwater
charged, was harassed, libel-
ed, and wire tapped in order
to discredit him. The sad
thing about the case, the
senator felt, is that “the Sec-

retary of State has not taken
proper eﬂfective action to
straighten out this mess.”

The ﬁnal responsibility
goes to the President him-
self, he added, because the
Otepka case was known for
months and nothing was
done about it.

In his speech, which was
interrupted 45 times with
applause, Goldwater outlined
his positions on Communism,
civil rights, social security,
and personal freedom.

In answer to charges that
he is against Social Security,
Goldwater said, “I will never
do anything to endanger the
beneﬁts of those who rely
on Social Security payments.
That is, and always has been,
my solemn pledge.”

He had seen, he stated, the
Democratic TV announce-
ments showing a Social Se-
curity card ripped up. His
SS card, he informed his
backers, “is in a safe back
home so Lyndon can’t get
hold of it.”

Goldwater described John-
son as a man who opens up
his arms and says, “Bring
your troubles to me. I will
take care of them for you.

“You want peace? I will
aid, appease, and accommo-
date the Communists for
you.

“You want more money
potatoes you didn't grow?
I’ll give it to you.

“You want no responsibil-
ities? I’ll do everything for
you.

“You want no worries? I’ll
worry for you.”

The only thing that the
President asks in return for
all this, Goldwater said, “is
that you give him more and
more power over your lives
— more and more without
end.”

Goldwater then continued
to set forth his own views
on personal freedom.

“How about voting for
freedom this time? . . . Those
who seek national office are
now even beginning to prom-
ise you freedom from worry
and freedom from responsi-
bility. But do you really be-
lieve that government can
make you rich and happy
and conﬁdent? Is that what

emO

Goldwater continued, “You
and I know that the Decla-
ration of Independence was
written by men who had
their bellies full of oppres-
sive government. And the
framers of the Constitution
were determined that we
should never again have a
government that would be
distant and that would be
arbitrary.

“To them the meaning of
freedom was clear. It meant
freedom from oppresive gov-
ernrnent.

“That’s why they gave us
our most precious political
gift; a government that is
limited and dispersed —— a
government that is close to
the people it serves.

“What has my opponent
had to say about preserving
the rights granted in the
Constitution?”

The audience shouted,
“Nothing I’’

Goldwater then said, “Let
us never forget that these
rights are constantly in
danger, not only from the
frontal assault but also from
erosion through un.intention-
al neglect and disregard. No

, person — whether govern-

ment official or private citi-
zen — should violate the
rights of some to further
the rights of others.”

On civil rights the nomi-
neerepeated his position that
he 1S “una1terably opposed to
discrimination.” “All good
Americans agree, he affirm-
ed, that the rights guaran-
teed by the constitution
must be realized.

“The President must exe-
cute his office and exercise
his moral leadership “to
make sure “these rights are
realized. '

“Congress must also take
action to remedy defects in
laws dealing with genuine
ClVll rights, and that is why
I voted for and supported
the acts of 1957 and 1960.”
_ “_0ur aim, as I understand
it, IS neither to establish a
Segregated society nor to es-
tablish an integrated society.
Our aim is to preserve a free
society.”

For this reason he opposed

Questions Success of New Frontier

By PETE HORN

Amidst outbursts of table
pounding, the customary
indication for approbation of
a debater’s point well taken,
two William Pitt Debating
Union members debated with

an equal number of Oxford
men Thursday in the Cathedral’s

English Classroom.

Wolf Swoboda, WPDU presi-
dent and senior in political sci-
ence, teamed up with Michael
Beloﬂ’, former president of the
Oxford Union Society, in propos-
ing “That America has failed to
advance to a new frontier.” Da-
vid Cornelius, speech sophomore,
and Jonathan Aitken, editor of
the Oxford Tory, opposed the
resolution. -

Swoboda held that one would
be well advised to regard Presi-
dent Johnson as conservative and

WPDU Debates Oxford

Belof contended that people are
“apt to exaggerate” President
Kennedy's accomplishments. The
New Frontier was a recoil, more
than an advance, he said. The
support which Goldwaterism has
received indicates the large-scale
failure of the Kennedy style and
highmindedness. Discussion
should concern itself with means
more than with directions, as the
New Frontier challenges rather
than promises.

Aitken, speaking fourth, be-
lied progress must be judged on
America’s own standards, rather
than on those of the Socialists.
He said the support given to the
New Frontier in upholding the
containment policy will be clear-
ly demonstrated by the election
majority with which Johnson will
win.

The speaker added that the

Oxford participated in the Pitt-Oxford debate here last Thursday.

Senator Goldwater as reactionary.
“Too much of our legislation
merely formalizes the status quo,
and does not present new solu-
tions to novel problems,” Swobo-
da said. One necessary condition
criticism, not
mere “complaint,” a la Goldwater.

In opposing this view, Corneli-
us asserted that new frontiers
are brought about now, just as
they have been throughout his-
tory. by activism. “It is attack-
ing the problem that causes us to
rise to new frontiers,” he said.
We need not use new ideas mere-

ly for their newness, because
means used in the past can work
just as well.

The Lost Generation

 

What is a college student?

A college student is a , 20-year-old
rounder who holds drunken orgies till 4 :00
in the morning——and ought tp get up at
ﬁve to chop wood and milk cows like the
rest of the population. A college student
is a girl who wears short skirts and bouf-
fant hair-dos — but . .  
who ought to wear 1
her hair in simple
braids and dress in
long, plain skirts,
good, homey Amer-
icans. A college stu-
dent is a dull-grey
conformist who fol-
lows the crowd and  ‘ ._ 
who cringes at crea- ’ ’ 
tivity — but who V , \ 
should stand alone V ‘ =
and be distinctive MISS DELANEY
like all the hard working suburbanites in

‘ the country.

A college student is this—and so much
more. At least that's what I'm told. Told

. by laborers at my father's plant, told by
' next door neighbors and their impudent

seven-year-olds, told by my ‘mother's ma-
tronly bridge club, by cab drivers, by sales
clerks, by plump church elders. _

A COLLEGE STUDENT, they say, is
a lazy bum with inch long ﬁngernails, who
sleeps till noon and despises work—but
who ought to realize, like every struggling
union member, that hard work 1S not only
a Christian virtue, but is also the only way
to get ahead. A college student is a moral
degenerate who advocates free _love, crib
notes, plagarism, and ticket ﬁxing —but
who should smile at policemen and scowl
at hotel-souvenir swipers like all the good,
honest, lawabiding citizens. _ _

A college student lives high—in fact

Conference Hears Chinitz

In Geneva

Dr. Benjamin Chinitz, University.

By Nancy Delaney

he's high most of the time. He doesn’t
catch colds—he catches gout. He's apa-
thetic and removed from reality — he
doesn’t even know who's running for coun-
ty treasurer.

A college student makes a mockery of
religion. He is a ﬁrm advocate of the doc-
trine of the ninety and nine: you know, if
you don’t want to climb that narrow, tor-
turous stairway, you just slide all the way
down the bannister. Then when you drop
off the end and go “bump,” if you cry a
little, God will send an elevator right after
you. College students just aren't willing
to work for their salvation like all the de-
vout ﬁrst-pew-sitters who serve the Lord
by building bigger church parking lots
and by glaring at anyone who drops silver,
rather than bills, in the collection plate.

“OKAY,” I SCREAM. “Okay. So this
is a college student. But how did you ﬁnd
out?” _,

“Well, we read — magazines, novels,
newspapers. And we go to movies about
college life. We know how you carry on.
We keep an eye on you; we're anxious for
your welfare. And such shocking behavior
we see; things we would never think of.
doing.”

The worst thing of all, they explain, is

the rampant disrespect on college cam- _

puses. Disrespect for one’s elders — and
even disrespect for the Scriptures. Try to
upbraid a college student for being pro-
ﬂigate, try to show him the way, try to
help him erase his errors, try to advise
him for his own beneﬁt. And all he'll do
is whisper “Pharisee” and break into rau-
cous laughter.

As the laughter echoes, I scribble a
quick note home: “Mom, please don’t be-
lieve anything you read about me.”

Operator Gives
Student Trouble

Editor, The Pitt News:

A recent occurance has made
me wonder what kind of persons
are manning the switchboard
here at Pitt.

Last week I called the Univer-
sity and asked to be connected
with the School of Education. I
was calling from a pay phone at
the time. The operator quickly
and curtly told me to call back
at 1 p.m. (it was 12:30 p.m. at
the time). She then hung up.

I had w.anted to place through
another call to a friend in the
‘dorms, but couldn't get a word
out of my mouth, the operator
hung up on me so quickly.

I don’t know whether this is
typical of all University opera-
tors or whether I just got in
touch with an especially nasty
one. I hope that was the case.

Face it! The University is a
business and any good business
stresses politeness over the tele-
phone. I would think it a good
idea for University operators to
operate under the same plan.

When the Panther football team takes the
ﬁeld against Notre Dame next Saturday they
will be after their ﬁrst win in four weeks. Their
chances of attaining it
will be slim.

Their chances will be
slim because Notre Dame
has a very ﬁne football
team and, more impor-
tant, Pitt has a very or-
dinary quarterback these
days. His name is Fred
Mazurek. For ten games
last year and for three
games this year Fred
Mazurek was not a very

SMIZIK ordinary quarterback ;

. it But all of a sudden Fred Mazurek is just an-

-3; '. . other quarterback.

 J Harriers Beat W V U;

End Season Unbeaten

There are many theories on what has hap-
pened to Mazurek, but one has gained special

" prominence because it is preached by so many

of his teammates. Fred's teammates are whis-
pering around that he is too much of a glory-
hound because he carries the ball too much
-he is ineffective.

What these same players fail too realize is
that Mazurek carried the ball quite often last
year and the opposing defenses never ﬁgured
him out. -

Michelosen Believes in Him

We personally think that this theory and
some of the others which try to name Mazurek’s
trouble are a lot of rubbish. We are happy to
see that John Michelosen has paid no heed to
them and has stayed with Mazurek almost all
the way. We happen to think Frederick Henry
Mazurek is one hell of a quarterback.

What then has happened to Mazurek in the
last four games? Syracuse coach Ben Schwartz-
walder is somewhat of an expert on Mazurek.
He saw him at his unbelieveable best last year
when Mazurek outgained the entire Syracuse

team in leading the Panthers to a 35-27 win, »

and he saw him Saturday when Mazurek was
held to ten vards rushing in 15 attempts.

What does Schwartzwalder think is wrong
with Mazurek? Nothing! “He’s just as tough
as he was last year.” Schwartzwalder said after
Saturday’s game. “The bio: difference is that
Pitt doesn’t have the same personnel as last
year.”

That is the big difference. Mazurek is every
bit as good as he was last year, but he's is not
getting one-half of the support he received last
season. ‘

Couldn’t Get Blocks

At Saturday’s game we saw Mazurek roll
to his left and need only a block from one of his

Freddy Rm?

halfbacks to be sprung loose. But the block
never came. The halfback was not tough
enough. We remember Bill Bodle making that
block plenty of times last year. But Bodle is
hurt now and the Panthers and Mazurek miss
him more than most people realize.

We saw one of Pitt’s tackles miss several
blocks Saturday allowing Mazurek to be spill-
ed and couldn’t help but remember how differ-
ent it was last year with Ernie Borghetti and
John Maczuzak at tackle or earlier this season
before Ron Linaburg was hurt.

Mazurek inadvertently agreed with
Schwartzwalder after Saturday’s game. First
he said, “I don’t know what's wrong. I'm doing
things just the same this year, but I can't get
loose lately.” ~

Then continuing in his Walter Winchell
style of talking, which makes note-taking al-
most impossible, Mazurek said, “last year the
holes were there and the blocking was there.
But this year we just don’t have the experi-
ence.”

So football players, quit spreading rumors
and start playing football. Take it from Ben
Schwartzwalder. He knows you have quite a
quarterback on your team. It’s still not too late
to make something out of this season.

but the Orange proved a Lit-

Panther linebacker Marty Schot-
tenheimer used words like “fan-
tastic” and “tremendous” to des-
cribe Little and he wasn’t far
wrong.

Little scored the ﬁrst Syracuse
touchdown by simply outrunning
the Panther defensive backﬁeld
from seven yards out.

Syracuse closed out their scor-

' sixth;

ceded second place to West Vir-
ginia’s senior captain Don

Bailey, Damien Koch, and Don
Hinchberger ﬁnishing third,
fourth, and ﬁfth, respectively. Al
Jackson of West Virginia was
sophomore Fran Shor
placed seventh; Mountaineers Ed
Fiertz and Ralph Morissey ﬁnish-
ed eighth and ninth; and harrier
Tom Serrka placed tenth.

Coach Jim Banner attributed

' the relative closeness of the score

to two factors. First and most
importantly he called the West
Virginia team “very strong” and
he considered them as “probably
the strongest cross-country squad
in the Southern Conference.”

Secondly, Banner noted that
runners Bailey, Koch, and much-

Pa.

be-rger could see that teammate
rather early and they knew that
Eichenlaub had the race won
Pitt was going to win without
them over-extending themselves.

When asked to appraise the
team’s undefeated season, Ban-

ner declared that “the kids made

it themselves. They worked hard
for it and they really wanted it.”
The coach indicated that he was
very satisﬁed with the overall
performances of his boys.

However, Banner was less en-
thusiastic «about the upcoming
IC4A meet. He said that it is
“tough to ﬁgure with some 150 to
200 boys competing.”

Once that meet is over, Banner
can look to the track season

ahead when all the cross-coun-

try runners will become track-
men.

offense used by the Panthers
which featured quarterback Fred
Mazurek playing a wide ﬂanker.
At times the offense had only
two guards and the center in on
the ball with the ends and tackles
split wide and with Mazurek,
playing left halfback, playing be-
hind the left end and tackle.

“We call that a garbage of-
fense,” Schwartzw.alder said.
“Every week we spend part of
our practice time working against
garbage; all kinds of crazy for-
mations we might run up against.
I guess all teams do it. Because
of this we didn't have a great
deal of trouble adjusting to that
offense.”

Dr. Carlson had been basketball coach
from 1922 to 1953. In those years his teams
won 369 games and lost 247. He coached
two national championship teams, one in
1927-1928, and the other in 1929-1930.

Dr. Carlson had just retired this Septem-

The Terps keyed their game around All-America center-
forward Eberhard Klein, left-halfback Roy Eales, and co-cap-
tain and center-halfback Dan Kupchyk. Kupchyk and Eales were
the switch men from offense to defense.

“We used them to switch from offense to defense,” said
Maryland coach Doyle Royal. “They did a great job, and their
quickness on changing facilitated our win.”

Royal felt the Terp’s speed and alertness were too much
for the booters. “We hurried them by pressing all the time, and
kept our passing close,” said Royal. “We’d- get a series of ﬁve
to seven passes on most of our play, while Pitt didn't.

he has more than just the same
number (44) as Brown and Davis
as he ran for 100 yards in 15

Mahle threw one of his infrequent
passes to Little and it was good
for a ﬁrst down on the Panther

tackle by Bob Dyer as he caught ,
the ball to make the play all the
more spectacular.

Jim Nance scored three plays

of the day for the Panthers were

Maryland Outclasses Soccermen

By BILL CABIN

His only trouble is that he had nothing to work with inside.”

Although Royal saw some merit in the booters performance,
Bemis felt they were inadequately prepared for the Terps. “They _
had better skills, and our trapping was terrible.” Trapping is

one of the basic soccer skills necessary to stop and settle the ball.

“Too many of our plays were ineffective,” said Bemis. “We
didn't play enough of the right style soccer. We should have
had more swinging (moving the ball from the halfbacks to

wings) and crossing (wings and insides passing to each other).”

The booters couldn't cope with the powerful Maryland of-
fense, as the Terps surged to a 4-0 halftime lead. Klein led their
offense netting two goals, and outmaneuvering the defense. The ' '

big center-fordward calmly harrassed Panther backs switching

his position along the line.

“That guy was everywhere,” said booter co-captain and cen-

ter-halfback Andy McGraw. “Our halfbacks couldn’t stop Klein,”

said Bemis.

The booters were constantly beaten by the Terms and fouled
them several times to break-up plays. “Maryland was quick,"

said halfback George Sommer. “They got the ball, saw a hole,

and were in there immediately.”
