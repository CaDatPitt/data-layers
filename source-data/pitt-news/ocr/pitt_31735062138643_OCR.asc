Pitt Debaters Tie
For First Place
At Kent Tourny

— Pitt’s debate team tied for ﬁrst‘
place in the annual Kent State De-
bate tournament last Saturday. Vic-

tory was shared by two other teams, .

Ohio Wesleyan and Kent State,
both of whom equalled Pitt's record
of six victories in eight debates.

Fourteen teams representing nine ‘-

colleges and universities provided
the competition. -
Pitt orators gained a moral vic-
tory when the negative team won
a decision over the co-champion
Wesleyanites. Also, in a previous
tournament, the jaﬁirmative team

defeated the other co-champion —'

team,_Kent State-. Harry Stark,
C, and Bernard Freidman, C,i.in
upholding the Pitt negativewon
three out of four debates. Allen
Abramson, BA, and Herman Feld-
man, C, representing the aﬂi_rma-
tive, won their ﬁrst three debates '
before losing the L fourth.

The subject of debate was, “Re-
solved that the United States should
cooperate in setting. up an interna-
tional police force upon the defeat
of the Axis.” "

In commenting on the diﬂiculties __ ‘

encountered in his debates, Abram-
son remarked,“‘Ea‘ch debate, after
the ﬁrst speech, was entirely differ-
ent. The negative teams kept us on
our toes by using a diiferentapc
proach. The Wesleyan girls, out
ﬁrst opponents, stressed sovereign-
ty; our second victims, the Capital
University boys, emphasized organ-
izational difficulties ; Akron worked
on economic causesof war.”

After their initial defeat by
Capital University, Debate-Mana-
ger Stark and partner Friedman
defeated the Wesleyan-men, the
Case men, and the Kent number
2 team. "

itt. Celebrates Charter Day, Sunday, 3
bserving 1 5 7 th Year Since Founding

Sunday will be~Charter Day at Pitt. It is 157 years since Hugh Henry Brackenridge crossed the Alle-
ghenies and received the charter to the Academy in Pttsburgh from the state legislature in Philadelphia.

We celebrate this Charter Day in a time of confusion.

' Pitt was born during a period of confusion. The Revolutio

nary War had just ended, and the Consti- -,

tution was not yet ratiﬁed when the four hundred citizens of Pittsburgh saw‘ﬁt"t'o’ startian Academy for
the study of literature, science, and art. .

“Whereas the education of youth-
ought to be the primary object of

every government, and whereas any '

school or college yet established is
greatly distant from the country
west of the Allegheny mountain,
and whereas the town of Pittsburgh
is most central to that settlement,

an academy for students must be ’

obtained in that town itself, a school
for the education of youth”——begins
the photostatic copy of the charter
which hangs on the wall in the ﬁfth
ﬂror delivery_ room. The original
c tarter was burned in a great ﬁre
tlat raged over the city, around
1819. F

This was the ﬁrst charter west of
the Alleghenies and north of the
Ohio-_—a tremendous undertaking for

"4'?/evbeen conducted through these rooms which have become almost a
tradition with Pittsburghers as one of the sight-seeing “musts”
' their :friends.

 [Recent visitors have represented eighteen countries of the
orld. Some of the notable oﬁicials visiting from other countries

The 17 nationality rooms that do
not have classes in "them during vis-
iting hours are open to visitors on
week-days from 1:30 to 4:30 o'clock;
Saturdays from 1:30 to 3:30 o'clock,
and Sunday from 3 to 5 o'clock.

. S t u d e nt . hostesses voluntarily
take visitors on tours through the
nationality rooms. It was their own
suggestion that the roomsbe open
_on _Sunday because that is the only
day that many of the visitors are
able to come. Recently, the social
committee of the Women's Self
Government Association began serv-
ing tea in the Commons Room tor
Sunday visitors and soldiers at the

posed of faculty members’ wives,

Blondell is the star of the show.
She is not. Not having the ability
to sing, it is physieallyimpossible
for her tostake the place of Ethel
Mermen. The musical numbers have
been cleverly rearranged so that
the’ star’s singing parts have been
eliminated.

This show is beyond question the

burgh season. The cast numbers into
the-ﬁfties or sixties,'and each mem-
ber of the cast changes. costumes a
half dozen times, if my dazzled im-
pressions are accurate.
The ﬁrst act contains enough-
dancing, comedy, A singing‘, -and
corn to occupy’ a volume of critical
comment. Suffice it to say that on
the whole it is satisfactory enter-
tainment. The plot is not devel-
oped with great clarity, and spme
of the dancing is rather senseless; 2
" it might be added ‘that the‘ chorus
. girls are somewhat, mediocre, as,
chorus girls go-e—but, then, _I am’
judging them by standards of
plr§?°sical beauty rather than'danc-
ing ability. - ;

Not until the second act does the
show hitiits best stride. Joan Blon-
dell, in an excellent comedy routine,
ﬁnally justiﬁes her presence on the
stage. This routine, performed with
her “cousin,” Betty Bruce, is a show

i might qualify as the star of “Some-.

Thereis a new twist to the old

A At Pitt, Dr. Jamison can well be
named the “umbrella woman,” for
she loans, umbrellas to students from
her office. ‘ ‘ ' '

But ‘now she's‘ out calling ‘.‘Any

new angle comes in. She’s not sell-
ing them. She’s asking for them.

It seems that there just ain't enuﬂ’
umbrellas anymore. Too many Pitt

in "third and fourth, respectively,
in the breast stroke megt to add
ﬁve more stickers to their total.
Campbell made the other two in the

free style race.

Chi, IF Swim Champs

In addition to Fisher's nine stick-
ers, Sigma Chi had Weimer scoring
four points, three and one-half in
the breast stroke and one-half in
the free style. The relay teams
tallied the other four markers.

The Delts had Garnham getting
a first in the free style race, May
swimming a dead heat with Weimer
of Sigma Chi for another half
point, and the relay squad scoring
one point plus Steytler’-s nine coun-
ters.

Pi-.KAs relay teams rang up four
points in each relay, Reimer gain-
ing three and one-half in a dead
heat with Weimer and Ste.inkirch-
ner making three.

The Phi Delts and SAEs scored
four markers to tie for ﬁfth slot, as
the Phi Eps came in last with two.

The fraternities will decide
whether to swim the two winners
over or whether to reswim the en-
tire meet to determine the ﬁnal
champ and cup-holder.

What’s In A Game?
~ With college sports approaching the caliber of high school
play, athletics are becoming decidedly more amateur in ter.
tiary schools all over the country. The only educational insti-
tutions capable of producing consistently winning teams dur.
ing these years will be the government military academies,
for here alone could an athlete assure himself of more than".
one or two consecutive seasons of competition, and the Navy"
.V-12 001198? training program hasn’t as yet developed long
enough to prove that a_ coach can turn out the best teams given
good material with insuﬂicient experience playing together.
In this way, the West Pointers and Annapolis should sport the
best squads for the next few years, or for the duration. Navy ’
stocked schools are of course far better off than the strictly. C»
Army schools, and the latest from the Navy promises contiyji. ‘'
ued participation of their trainees in varsity competition,

As for Pitt, let us have one minute of silence. Doctor Carl- A
son will have to start from scratch next season with the pros- ‘.3.-0.
pect of no holdovers. Rudy Buck and Bill Pandak leave sobn  "A
for the services, Walt Jones willxgraduate, and the rest will . 
be draft eligible by next‘ December. Clark Shaughnessy will U‘.
have a guard and a tackle and 1a fullback, a few ends, and some 0 ‘A
assorted players with which to start facing Notre Dame A
Great Lakes, and ARMY! - ’,

It Seems: though: that Present-day coaches have more

i at stake than the school whose team they coach. Alma Mater. ‘-

is primarily an educational project, with sports, clubs and
other extra curricular activities to create a coherence of spirit
essential to mass education but lacking in classes alone. So i 
the school hires a coach who is paid to develop this spirit and" ’ it
unfortunately is judged by his winning percentage. This ap-
pears to be the most important, and coaches must attain this
end to maintain themselves. The -‘result is a degeneration of 4
13119 Original idea of inter-school competition. The ideal situa- » ‘
tlon _would be more players out for a sport, practising and ‘.4:
playing with an attitude of friendly competitive -mental and
physical stimulation in which the outcome is of purely second- ‘‘
ary importance. Now, to reach a secondary objective, coaches 
key “P their teams. upsetting‘ an emotional balance which 
makes _the players forget why they are playing. Therefore V I
subsidization, prevalent in most colleges, is basically wmngl  *1’
but ethically and ﬁnancially successful. 'A 

The wrong spirit begins indeﬁnitely far back in every-. '.'~ if
one, when emulation of professionals creates a desire for win- 
ning, not just winning something that has a value, but win-
ning anything. This misinterpretation will continue, accented
as the person involved moves to “higher” education where V
craftiness is taught to replace basically simple eﬂ"ort.i S

A Fairly Successful Season 9’ '

Pitt’s basketball ' tail-ender tomorrow at Morgantown 
should see our boys come out with a highly respectable per.
centage for an all civilian team, .500. They didn’t exactly “win
’em all,’f but they didn’t lack any spirit, something for‘ which

gigdsﬁudent body, by half-hearted support, failed to give them, 

7 What we want now is also a good baseball season Very
few holdovers from last year’s team strikes a note as discord-if ’ »
ant as our other athletic squads in the matter of veterans but’ ‘i 
Coach Ralph Mitterling should be able to do something with
twobatteries of last year. Jim~Reber, number two pitdlier of i
1943, will be back in Navy uniform from Dental School and
Joe Kielb, left-handed catcher, is still here. The second set
includes Pitcher Jack Citron and Catcher Al Wettengel who . .
were unable to continue playing last year soon after the season "
began. Last grisard is the slugging outﬁelder, Bob McKee. ‘ '

On the whole, Coach Mitterling should consider himself
no less fortunate than his fellow coaches, and we can expect of - ' ,‘
his crew the same pep’ shown by other lettermen. ‘ I
