Stanley Woodward is a famous
painter of winter scenes. But it. is
doubtful whether any of his repro-
ductions could have extracted as
many “ahs”“as were uttered by
Pittsburghers as they woke up on
March second. »

That was the day when trees
and houses were capped with snow
——17 inches deep. Streets were
smooth and unmarked——until
workers began trudging toward de-
fense factories, and students to-
ward schools.

Some. never got there.

Dr. Elmer Giaper, head of the
University political science depart-
ment, never got to Pitt; nor did
Mr. Lawrence Irwin, manager of
the University press. They were
snowbound. Mrs. —A1ice Dorfield,
secretary in the dean of men’s office
walked from “The Point;” one girl
from Mt. Washington, and another
from Carrick did the same.

Inclines, milk-trucks, bread-
trucks, taxis, buses, and the thumb
were used to get the students and
faculty to school. Agnes Lynch
Starrett, editor of Pitt magazine,
walked two miles, then rode an
incline, and ﬁnally flagged an al-
ready occupied cab.

Navigation Course Offered * 

“Navigation courses cause the
most trouble for Naval Reserve
candidates, according to ensigns
who have taken the training cours-
es,” said.Dr. James S. Taylor, head
of the department of mathematics,
today.

He made this statement concern-
ing a number of math courses which
are being offered to students who
wish to enter the Reserve or have
already done so and want extra
training. ‘ , ,

One course, beginning on March
31,‘ will be of valuable assistance
to men who have passed the en-
trance requirements for the Re-
serve and are waiting to be called.
The course will cover the more
difficult parts of “Navigation and
Nautical Astronomy” as taught in
the training schools of the Reserve.

“Men will get the same work
when they enter the Reserve train-
ing schools,” Dr. Taylor explained,
“but the work is covered so fast

PTM To Hear

Anglo-American
Religious Views

Two religious leaders, Dr. Ev-
erett Clinchy, Presbyterian minis-
ter, and Dr. Sol Tax, Chicago eth-
nologist, will be guests of Pitt
Town Meeting Monday.

They will discuss wartime re-
ligious views in the United States
as compared with those in Great
Britain.

Similar to last week’s meeting,
the discussion will be conducted
at 2:30 o’clock in the Fine Arts
room, 324 Cathedral.

Drs. Clinchy and Tax will be the
ﬁrst off-campus speakers that Pitt
Town meeting has had this sem-
ester. The meeting is sponsored by
the Religious Activities committee
of the University, in conjunction
with the student council of the
Young Men’: and Young Women’:
Hebrew association.

Dr. Clinchy is a Presbyterian
minister who has extended his in-
terests to include all creeds and
many ﬁelds. From 1928 to 1933 he
was a member of the secretarial
staff of the Federal Council of the
Churches of Christ in America, and
since 1928 has been director of the
National Conference of Christians
and Jews.

Dr. Clinchy flew to Great Britain
and Ireland last fall to study the
religious and social trends among
the people living under the stresses
of war. In discussions with Eamon
de Valera, president of Eire, and
the people themselves, he discov-
ered their reactions during war
time.

Dr. Tax has done ethnological
and sociological: research in Guate-
mala for the Carnegie Institute of
Washington.

In July of this year he will go
to the University of Mexico as a
visiting professor of anthropology.

Since,l930,,. as a member of va-

rious expeditions and commissions,

, he has studied the traits and cus-

toms of Central and United States

Indians on which he has published

various articles and has prepared
three books.

Sales totals Wednesday showed
$144.75 from 579 stamp pur-
chases, and $225 in bonds. The

stand mainly for these three

things to us, the Czechoslovak students at the
University of Pittsburgh: '

For the program of humanity and cultural
achievement. He said “Our ideal is to become
the cultural and moral vanguard of human-
ity.” He believed a small nation could only
maintain itself by humane means, "‘an en-
lightened head and a warm heart.”

For the ideal of seeking truth above all else.
His motto was “Truth prevails.” The story of
his life is‘ full of struggles on behalf of the
truth and the right only, many times for un-
popular or seemingly lost causes.

For creative patriotism, work and toil for
one’s nation. At the age of sixty-ﬁve, risking
his life and his career, leaving behind his fami-
ly, he departed from his country, and entered
upon the greatest battle he had yet known.
Its result was the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

Masaryk was
prince. His work has been temporarily de-
stroyed, yet his ideals and the example he
gave to his nation cannot be annihilated by
tanks or parachutes. '

Pitt students are funny creatures. It has been said that
the average person loves to back a winner; maybe that’s true.
As a Pitt Student we really don’t know.

From the golden era of Pitt football to the seeminglf;
hopeless present days, the students have full heartedly wor-
shippedthe gridiron sport. Today the Panther football pic-
ture is far from bright for their yesteryear material has dwin-
dled. But still the students give backing to the gridders. On
this point we give three cheers.

Doctor Carlson's “hot-chocolate eat-
e~rs”lhad their worst season in the last 18 .
years, and yet the loyal students ﬁlled the
Stadium every time they played. The
good Doctor probably deserves arr} off
yearnow and then, so we give no punish-
ment for attending a basketball game. _

But what about the only consistent-
ly winning athletic aggregation in the
sc‘hool_-—the swimming-squad-? Surely the
me;+lh’en practice as oftenand as hard
as do; the gridders and cagers. They also give the spectators
as much. of a thrill. 1 _ ~

they will have to do some high
stepping if they expect to outpoint
such teams as Fordham, Princeton
and NYU.

In last year’s competition in the
Gardens, the locals came home
with a tie for second honors with
NYU. The University ‘of Fordham
won the affair and are again favor-
ed. to come out on the long end this
season. Coach Giengengack has an
ace—in—the—hole with his Ram two-
mile relay squad. However, close on
their tail will be Princeton and
NYU, especially the Violets, who
have a trump in M-acMitchell to
play against the Rams. The dark-
horse of the meet will be Penn
State who has a strong chance to
win.

ln addition to the Relay-men,
the Panthers have Carter in the
60-yard dash and the broad jump,
and Jessup and Rhoades in the
pole-vault. Nobody else but Car-
ter’s friend Mr. Barney Ewell will
“Bullet Bill” have to worry about
in the dashes. Carter has yet to
overcome the Penn State flash in
the present campaign.

Rhoades and Jessup will meet
the best in the East tomorrow in

Tomorrow night at ten o'clock
the ﬁnal results will be in; if they
add up to another win for the Pan-
ther swimming team, it will mean
one of the greatest winning sea-
sons that the Gold and Blue water
sport has ever enjoyed. At the pres-
ent, the team has a record of five
wins and one loss chalked upyfor
them.

The Pitt swimming team has
been the only varsity aggregation
‘to show any semblance of consist-
ency, in a winning way. They
mean to keep this up when they
face the strong Michigan State
squad tomorrow night in the Pitts-

burgh Athletic Association pool.

in facing the Spartans from
Michigan, the locals will be up
against an outﬁt that thus far this
season has produced a record of
two wins, three losses, and one tie.
Not much of a record you say, but
Panther coach Ben Grady thinks
differently. Grady says that it’s
going to be a hard fought battle
all the way and is inclined towards
the pessimistic viewpoint because-
.of the fact that State has too many
good second place men.

By good second place men, he
lmeans those that can always be
-counted _on to capture second place
, points and sometimes ‘ V come

' Although two inarksmen,Larry

let parade at a torrid clipjthe var- ‘

sity riﬂers seem to be unable to
win consistently.
The “off and on” Panther Trig-
germen dropped two more deci-
sions while adding a lone victory
during the past week-end postal
series. The University of Maryland
and Penn State beat the local boys,
but Boston university could not.
However, Captain La Spada and
gunmate Bruno Cengia both made
all-out efforts for our cause, ﬁring
276. These two boys, along-with
Johnny Helbling, have been the on-
ly bright spots in an otherwise me-
diocre season. La Spada should

Sigma Chi moved one step closer
to the lntraniLu'al bowling crown
last Tuesday by beating the High-
steppers, 2-0. The _fraternity
champs were really hot, taking;
over the Independent leaders by
more than 70 pins in both matches.

In the first game, the Sigma Chi
team rolled a fair 658, which was
more than, good enough to beat
the Highstepper 586. The frater-
nity men really moved in the sec-
ond match, piling up a, total of

Hence a team that can hold its
own in taking first places and show
a bulge in their share of seconds
will win.

The visitors are led by co-cap-
tains, John Becker and Fred Still-
man. Standout member of the squad,
however, is junior Fred Newton,
who was a. sensation during his
freshman term. Other ace perform-
ers on the Spartan team are breast- ,
stroke man Charlie Bigelow and‘
sprinter Fred Himmelien.

Ovei-shadowing coach Grady’s
pessimism is the fact that he has
several good men to throw into the
Fray. Could he have forgotten that

Herb Cosgrove, Al Samson, and
Joe Kaule on the team? These Pitt
mermen have been en_ioying a top-
notch season, and they shall not be
denied a win in the last dual mee‘.
ofthe year.

Gus Wilde, a junior, has reach-
ed his peak this year and has ful- "

Buell Whitehill was sitting

around tearing a hemolytic strep-

» came in. . ’

“Hemolytic streptococci,” he
mumbled, “will be my undoing."

“Mr; Whitehill,” we said, ap-

“Hemolytic streptococci,” he ex- ‘
plained in his most patient profes-
sional manner, “are germs, -Scar-

Anyone with half an eye could

There was a peculiar women-ah

we slowly backed towards the
door.

“Restrain yourself, Mr. White-

But there was no calming him.

Included in Foster Collection

By ALLEN Annausou

Acknowledged as the greatest
collection of Fosteriana in the
world, the records and exhibits in
the Foster memorial on the Uni-
versity campus includes over 12,000
items. '

The collection, started by Josiah
Lilly in 1930, is so complete that
practically every item relating to

. Foster is included. Because of the
prices offered for possessions of
Foster, even forged letters have
been sent in, and one is on exhibit.

Very few original letters of the
famous composers have been discov-
ered. Of those on display, one is
written by Foster to his sister an-
nouncing his coming marriage to
Jane McDowell.

One of the few pictures of Fos-
ter, taken just two weeks before
he died, and his only portrait, also
are on display.

Perhaps the most important item
is the book of original manuscrips
in which he wrote his songs. ln
the book are more than two hun-

_ dred pages of first drafts in Fos-

in-1"};-Q,

ter’s handwriting showing publish-

ed and unpublished songs, verses,

inscriptions, and cartoons.

First editions in the collection
number more than 180. Almost all

of the ﬁnished manuscripts that he_

sent to be published were destroy-
ed so only six of these are in the
collection.

At Foster’s death, only 36 cents
and a scrap of paper were found in
his pockets. The bit of paper, prob-
ably a song title, read, “Dear
Friends and Gentle Friends.” Both
the scrap of paper and the coins
are on display in the shrine.

Besides regular Fosteriana, a ﬁle
of recordings of different arrange-
ments of Foster music is kept up
to date.
cordings by Gene Krupa.

Charged with maintaining the
collection are Fletcher B. Hodges,
J r., curator, and his staff, who keep
the memorial not only as a museum,
but as a center of education of the
life and times of the famed musi-
cian.
