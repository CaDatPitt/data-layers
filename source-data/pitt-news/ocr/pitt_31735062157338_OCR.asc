Pitts Face Fearsome
State Ground Attack .

By STAN SKIRBOLL
It will be the Pitt Pa’s watching the Pitt Panthers tomorrow at
he Stadium, as the Blue-and-Gold plays host to Michigan State,
nother of the top grid teams in the country.
With Dad_’s Day a feature of the game, the Spartans come to
'itt with a feature of their own— Everett (Sonny) Grandelius.

As number two ground gainer

irandelius will mean another crease
:11 Coach Len Casanova’s brow.

Line Tough, Too

The rest of the creases for Casa-
.ova comes from the reports about
%tate’sterrific offense. The- Spartans
Lave rolled to 2192 yards on the
;round, and 702 yards through the
it.

On defense, the Staters lave a
setter-than-average rushing defense.
Fhey have allowed 937 yards on the
ground. Their pass defense is a bit
veak, however, as opponents have
-gained 1025 yards by passes.

The Panthers will have to con-
:entrate their efforts in stopping
Srandelius. Already the Spartan
lalfback has broken the all-time
Michigan State record set by Lynn
Zhadnois,andany yardage he makes
against Pitt will add to the record.

Pressure on Bestwick

V A brief glance at Grandelius’
;records for the season indicates
that he has averaged 6.6 yards per
:try; that he has gained no less than
 yards running against any of
State's opponents; that he has scored
,2 touchdowns, at least one per
game; and that he has taken seven
passes for 69 yards.

if Unless the Spa.rtan’s coach, Big-
gie Munn, decides to change his
ilefensive strategy, the Panthers
jwill have to rely on Quarterback
Bob Bestwick to do another super-

llative passing job. I

i Pitt's futile running attack will
be further. bogged down with the
zloss ofFullback Joe Capp, who was
injured in the Notre Dame game last
week so that Bestwick, who broke a
;Pitt passing record against Notre
;Dame, probably will have to go to
lthe air to make any yardage.

DeRosa Leads Ends

Nick DeRosa is still the leading
pass receiver for the Panthers with
19receptions for 261 yards,followed
closely by Chris Warriner who has
12 for 224 yards.

The Pitt line, which began to
show signs of life the last two
games, might be the deciding fac-
tor in tomorrow's game. If the for-

Dads to See
State Game

Tomorrow. is Dad’s Day at the
Stadium.

Sponsored by Student Congress
and the Athletic Office, Dad’s Day
will give Pitt students a chance to
bring their dads to a game as well
as sit with them. ~

Further interest was attached to
the event with the announcement
by the Athletic Office that fathers
of the players will attend as guests
of the University. They will wear
the same numerals as those carried
by their sons on the field.

The Varsity Marching Band also
will join, in the day's festivities.
The first formation which the band
will go into will be a'gigantic.D-A-D.

Tickets for Dad’s Day are still
on sale at the Student Desk. The
price of $4.25 includes admission
to a reserved seat at the game as
well as to a roast beef dinner to
be served at the cafeteria preced-
ing the gridiron affair between the
Panther and Michigan State teams.
Tickets to the game alone are 33.50.

Herman Levy, student head of the

‘ Dad’s Day affair, stated, "Obser-

vance of Dad’s Day will result in
further appreciation of Pitt football
and cement Pitt spirit.”

This will be the last officially

The pep meeting will be con-

11:45 a.m.

Andy Schurman, in the disguise

afternoon 9,; 3:30 p.m. in Stephen
Foster Menforial. They will hear 'a
recommendation, made by Upper-
class Court, that freshman should
not receive Panther keys this sem-
ester.

Upperclass Court contends that
the Class of '54 has been "lacka-
daisical and neglectful.” Dean
Nutting, in a statement made this
week, saidithat the action of the
Upperclass Court in this matter is

"arbitrary, capricious, and con-
trary to evidence.”
The action of the Upperclass

Court came as a surprise to Dean
Nutting, who thinks that this fresh-
man class is the “most energetic
and spirited” one he has seen

All freshmen and their upperclass
counsellors have been notified by

Congress

Backs MC

Student Congress has joined
Men's Council and WSGA in op-

posing Commons Room Council's '

plan to clean up the Commons
Room. I
At Monday's meeting the leg-

Q

informally discussed the
plan to impound all coats and lunches
left in the Commons Room and then
fine theirclaimants ten cents. They
agreed that CRC was out of bounds
in proposing such a plan.

President Howard Greenberger
said he did not think 'CRC had the
authority to put the plan into effect.
since, as an all-women’s organiza-
tion, it does not adequately repre-
sent the student body.

SC Wants Credit

He said only legal course would
be to work as a committee of Con-
gress, and until it becomes such a
committee, "they will be treading
on our shoes."

Don Ewart pointed out that, even
ifCongress decided to back a clean-
up plan, it still could do nothing’
but advise. “We are not a police
rorce,” he said, “and until we have
police'"power the job will have to be
left to the University marshals.”

The matter was dropped there,but
Vice-President Bill McKinley kept
the Commons Room in the spotlight
with a report of his committee's pro-
gress in securing the Commons Room
for dancing.

He said the manufactuer of a well
known floor wax had assured him
that a good wax suitable for stone
floors is available. “This, McKinley
said, "eliminates our chief physical
difficulty.”

Dea.n's Meeting Scheduled

He also reported that a meeting
,.with Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, is scheduled for next week to
discuss the question. - However,
McKinley did not think there was
much hope of getting approval of a
Christmas dance for the Commons

gress approve a plan by which his
committee would ask for permission
to hold two traditional dance‘: there
each year.

If permission is granted, he said-
plans could be made to hold this
spring’s Graduation Dance there.

After a brief discussion, Congress
approved his plan. '

Law Students

Law students John D.Rhodes and
Robert Carson today were represent-
ing Pitt in a nationwide moot court
-competition at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Moot court is a mock trial held

room procedures.

Carson was selected to represent
Pitt on the basis of his record in
moot court as a freshman in law
school. Rhodes was picked because
of his high overall standing to two
years in moot court.

The case to be argued involves
the question_of law arising from the
use of artificial means to induce
rainfall. The two Pitt men will argue
the defendents standpoint in this
case.

If they win today, they will then
compete with Temple University.
Victory with Temple will entitle
them to compete in the national fi-
nals in New York in December.

The lecture was the last in the

Attitude

Phi Epsilon Pi president Irv
Faigen outlined Wednesday the
Pitt chapter's stand in ‘the con-
troversy between the fraternity’s
national officers and rebelling
chapters.

The split in fraternity unity
started when the University of Conn-
ecticut chapter was suspended after
it pledged a Negro students.

Questioned on the way Pitt's
Phi Eps will vote at the frat’s emer-
gency convention in Philadelphia
Dec. 27-28, Faigen replied:

"I believe that we will goon
record as saying that the Connecti-
cut chapter or any Phi Ep chapter
should be able to live up to the
spirit of the Constitution and initiate
whomever they wish.”

This is a reversal of the attitude
the Pitt chapter’s delegates took
at the fraternity’s national conven-
tion two months ago. At that time
it joined in sustaining the black-
ball of the Uconn chapter's Negro
pledge by the frat’s grand council.

"IF THE SHOE FITS” -" Tonight
at the Cinderella Ball one of the
women attending will be named
Cinderella. The dance Ellsworth
Center-sponsored will be held at
the Edgeworth Country Club from
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tickets are $3.25
or $2.25 and an EC activity card.

  

Centerites Seek Cinderella

  
   
   
 
 
   
  
   
  
 
  
  
 
  

Faigen named the ,Connecticut
chapter’s ultimatum threatening with-
drawal, not the pledging of a Negro
man they wanted, as the reason for
the suspension

However, Faigen acknowledged
that the Uconn chapter would have

been suspended even without the
withdrawal‘ threat if it had disre-
garded the blackball and initiated
the man.

Faigen called false the charges
»that the grand council used "steam-
roller” tactics, contending that the
burden of proof of the injustice of
the blackball rested with the Uconn
chapter.

He voiced his own belief that the
Connecticut Phi Eps were counting
on the fact that the delegates were
uninstructed on the blackball issue

I to work in their favor, implying that
their strategy backfired.

Another quick note on the Commons Room controversy.
Dean of Men Theodore Biddle has reaffirmed his belief that

the Room should be cleaned up.

Dean of Women Helen P. Rush has previously said that she
is in favor of moving all coats, books, lunches, etc., out of it.

So if the administration decides
to go ahead and clean up the room,
I think it will be defeating its own
interests, the best education of
the students at Pitt.

For while the Commons Room is
beautiful and fine to look at, it is
not especially useful in its present
state and will be less so if clean-
up plans go through.

But in the past -years the stu-
dents have increased its use until
it is finally assuming its rightful
place in their daily attendance. at
Pitt. The Room,"f>reviously a great
vault on the first floor of the
Cathedral, has become a part of
student life. ’

It is serving the purpose of the
students now. And if they want to
use~it for an indoor loafing place
which might involve leavingcoats,

books, and lunches around on the
tables and chairs, well, it seems
to me that it is all right.

It is too bad that the feeling
around the school on the part of
many members of the administra-
tion is that the student’s Commons
Room can not be useful at the
same time it is beautiful.

_ . Greek Prejudice

In the current hullabaloo over discrimination and prejudice on
the American campus, the Greek-letter franernities have been
subjected to a running barrage of sniping by overzealous and un-
informed critics of the fraternity system whose criticism is
leveled first at fraternities and second at discrimination.

Such is the nature of the editorial column appearing elsewhere
on this page, dealing with the present flare-up in the national
organization of Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity.

The author of that column, one of the News’ most capdrle
writers, cites the Phi Ep controversy as an example of the rigid
prejudice of the fraternity system (a rather sweeping assertion,
at that). A clearer look at the incident, however, indicates that
the reaction to the fraternity’s grand council ruling. againsttbe
pledging of a Negro student to the Connecticut chapter is one of
the healthiest signs that fraternity men, at least Phi Ep fraternity
men, are strongly behind the movement to erase the bias smears
from the national fraternity slate.

All reports on the actions of the individual fraternity chapters
show that the mass of the undergraduate Phi Eps are against the
national’s ruling at their last assembly, which was allegedly

railroaded through.

The general feeling, as far as can be determined, points to
a re-vote of all the chapters which will uphold the Connecticut
chapter's pledging of the Negro student. If so, Phi Epsilon Pi can
proudly claim to have taken a large and important step toward real
brotherhood among men of all creeds, classes, and colors.

Case in Point

——

By MYRON KOPLEMAN

(See editorial, “Creek Prejudice,”
on this page.)
exclusive

America’s , country

I clubs have reason to rejoice these

days, for proof positive has been
obtained that their farm clubs -
the college fraternities — are turn-
ing out a splendid crop of prospec-
tive members.

Connecticut University's chap-
ter of Phi Epsilon Pi, predominant-

I 1y a Jewish frat, has been suspend-

ed from the national for pledging a
Negro, thus establishing beyond a
doubt the effectiveness of frater-
nities as molders of mouldy minds.

The old defense for the exist-
ence of Jewish, Negro, Italian, and
other minority fraternities was that
the formation of such organizations
was a defensive move resulting from
the exclusion of minority members
by the blue-blood frats. This thediy
may have been true at one time, but
not so now.

Huddlie Together
Here we have a minorit "brother-
the Phi Eps, refusing to

take in someone of another minority.

I The boys have become so used to

huddling together in one homogen-
eous bloc that they cannot conceive
of having an outsider present.

C There, in short, is the crux of the

argument against the whole frater-
nity system.

w

The Phi Ep case is a beauty. It
solves all doubts.

When one minority becomes so
nurtured to the glory of seclusion
that it rejects another minority"
then you have the convincer that
the “brotherhood” setup, as it
now stands, is completely at odds
with any liberal education system.
This-, despite the presence of so
many "nice guys” in the frater-
nities.

You know, whenever you criti-
cize the fraternities, you are told
that "there are lots of nice guys,
unprejudiced, who belong to frats.”
If ever an argument insulted the
intelligence, this one does.

They Go Along

The fact is that while these nice
guys may exist, and while they may
be unprejudiced, they nevertheless
go passively along with the rules
of exclusiveness, consequently
adding strength to the forces of
bigotry. In time, they, too, take
their place as good, solid country
club members.

No, fraternities cannot be justi-
fied because they have nice guys,
or because they contribute to
charity, or because they regale high
school football stars.

The frat boys have been paying
for higher education, but they have
yet to learn that you don't spell
democracy with a captial P-r-e-j-

u-d-i-c-e .

With regard to "Coffee vs.

Spirit" of Nov. 7, may lash, "Why
“school spirit”?” I am 
not so crude that I am new inspired
by my Alma Mater and proud of her. a
I am also proud of my religion but
I do not as a result become a
shouting fanatic over it and try to
make everyone believe ‘my way. I
have a pride in. my country, but I
do not come to school each morn-
ing waving Old Glory, singing The
Star Spangled Banner, and de-
nouncing Russia i‘n the cirrent
style. Nevertheless, your edito-
rial gives the impression that if
one has pride in his school, he

J should make a great display of his

"school spirit.” To do this pro-
perly he should don his silly lit-
tle hat, and if I can believe my
eyes and ears, bellow football
songs and cheers in the sacred
Commons Room, set off fire works
there, disrupt classes here and at
other schools, tie up traffic, and in
general act as if he were demented.
Getting drunk helps.

To the stalwart heroes of the _

football team (many of whom, I
suspect, would not have scholar-
ships if they were not football
players) let me apologize for af-
fronting them by my absence from
the rally. This is truly a cardinal
sin since education has apparently
been succeeded by football as the
prime activity of the University.

As a freshman I have always been
impressed by the usefulness of the
Commons Room, and I was sorry to
hear that there was an attempt to
take it away from the students.

I was told that in the past there
was a suggestion that a dance be
held in the Commons Room and that
it was not appreciated by those in
charge.‘ Since public sentiment
seems to be with extended use of
the Commons Room I think that now
is the time to "talk up” a similar
dance.

In the short time I have been here
I have se'en how influential the
"News” can be in worthy student
movements and I think that you could
do a real service by "playing up”
such a dance.

To Bob Thomas’ column (Over-
set) of Friday, November 10, I

wish to say Amen.

Where can you find a more suit-
able spot for an all student dance
than the Commons Room, especially
a Christmas Dance?

it has been shown that the cost

would be small. It isn’t bad to
imagine the Commons Room with a
few extra decorations besides the
usual Christmas trees, thecheerfnl
glow of roa-ing fireplaces, refresh-
ments buffet style, and soft dance
music ﬂoating through the arch-
ways.

What better way could there be

Ever since the collegiate rules committee abolished the fair catch

an

against theiclnnge.

Lately, the damn’ to return the
hi catch has grown louder and
stronger. One particnlxly strong
advocate warns the fair catch re-

snkty men are still alive.”

Pitt Conch Len Casanova said
he would definitely be in favor of
returning the fair catch to the rules
"if it appears under the present
rule that the safety.rnan is unduly
endangered.” ,

"After all,” Casanova continued
"I believe the safety of the players
should be the prime consideration
in football.

“h on case this season, we
haven't been too concerned with

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

It was rather slow in coming, but Len Casanova’s Panthers
are finally displaying the deception for which the T-formation is

famous.

Fans who journeyed over to
Notre Dame witnessed a liberal
injection of flankers, men-in-

motion, and even a man-in-motion
who goes out and comes back
again before the ball is snapped.
Passes, of course, were thrown
all over the place.

And the Irish were baffled no

‘ little.

Speed and offensive potential

' are necessary to produce deception

so it is unfair to
blame Casanova
for taking so long
to bring out that

quality. Last
week was the
first time since

the season open-
er that he had
both his top half-

Sichko, ready for
simultaneous full-

Sichko

In Nick DeRosa and Chris Warri-
ner, Cas has a pair of offensive
ends who could do any club proud.
Throw in Reynolds and Sichko, and
you have four pass-catchers cap-
able of giving defensive seconda-
ries plenty of ulcers.

Providing Quarterback Bobby
Bestwick continues to bear out
Casanova’s failh in him as he did

 

in completing 19 of 24 passes last
week, the Panthers could give
Michigan State a pack of trouble
tomorrow.

Panthers Reacfionary?

Pitt's Panthers will probably be
accused of being selfish reaction-
aries, for they have been making
the Communist Daily Worker look
rather foolish of late.

Football predictions in the
Worker sports pages had West
Virginia beating the Panthers and,
a week later, the Panthers edging
out Notre Dame “in a situation that
would probably require a UN Secu-
rity Council meeting.”

Don’t a'sk fne whether the prog-
nostications were leftish, but they
certainly were not right.

Hamilton vs. Rush

I hope the boys who put together
this paper won't be faced with a
space shortage and be forced to
drop the last paragraph from this
column. If they do, there is going
to be trouble between Athletic
Director Tom Hamilton and Dean of
Women Helen P. Rush.

According to a Toledo paper,
Hamilton is one of the few men
ever to live in the Delta Delta
Delta sorority house at Ohio State.

But you see, the sorority house
was formerly the Hamilton family
homestead. That better, Miss Rush?

Bulletin!

Psi Omega dental fraternity
whipped the Civil B's, 32-0, in a
quarter-final [M playoff game yes-
terday at Schenley Oval, as the
playoffs went into their third day.

I

‘A fist fight and a last-minute
scoring threat climaxed one of the
hottest intramural final periods this
year, as the Buckeyes nosed out
the South Side Onyx, 24-23, to gain
a semi-final playoff berth Tuesday.

Jim Robinson accounted for two
Buckeye scores, with Kay Lewis
and Chuck Martin each scoring one
TD for the winners.

Frank Paparella of the Onyx‘
whipped three touchdown passes
to Leo Ra_zza, Bee Palonis, and’
Leo McNicho'las.

A safety for the Onyx completed

their scoring.

In the last half-minute of the
game, with the Onyx on the one-yard
line, two rival players were thrown
out of the game for fighting.

After they were penalized,
the Onyx again moved to the one-
yard line, but time ran out before
the losers could push across the
winning points.

Locals Upset

the intramural playoffs,as the Delta
Sigma Deltas scored a 14-4 victory
over the generally favored Locals.
Dave Noble and Bob Hall led the
Delts" attack, as they accounted
for both of the club’s touchdowns.
Hall completed one TD pass to
Noble to take the lead in the first
quarter, and in the closing minutes
of the game,they collaborated again ,

Flashy DTD Wins

A flashy Delta Tau Delta team
with the all-around brilliant playing
of Kent Thorpe knocked the Phi

Eps Off, 15-6, at Schenley Oval
Wednesday night.
Both of the DTD touchdowns

were results of Thorpe’s passing
abi1it$'- On the receiving end were
Ralph Douglas and Ed Truter.

The Phi Eps .only touchdown
came in the second half on a pass
from Mickey Steiner to Gerson
Green.

Sigma Chi Nipped

“Who Will Outscore Who?” was
the title, place was Schenley Oval,
and the time was Wednesday eve-

outscgring Sigma Chi, 31-27.

Al Locnikar and Marty Kohr were
the two principal players for the
PiKA’s in the first half, with
“Lock” on the throwing end, and

touchdowns. The Sigma Chi’s lone
score was from Dick Raunswinder

Jayoee Center Repelletl if  

By VMI Hazing Tactics

Several centuries ago, Alexander
Pope coined the phrase: “Fools
rush in where angels fear to tread.”

If you want an opinion on just
how true that idiom can be in this
day and age, then ask Clarence
Bernhardt Goldacker - a center on
Coach Steve Petro’s jayvee football
squad. He’ll tell you emphatically
that you’d have to be afool to accept
a scholarship to a military school.

And - in his opinion '-‘-‘ a lot
bigger fool to accept one to Vir-
ginia Military Institute, the West
Point of the South.

Couldn't Stomach It

The former Dormont High athlete
just could not stomach some of the
upperclassmen’s school—sanctioned
pranks which, according to him,
were supposedly designed to sep-
arate the men from the boys.

“Goldie” is not talking through
his hat when making these denun-
ciations. He "has one semester of
torture to back up his very state-'
ment.

“Somehow, but fortunately for
me, my scholarship,2§'0f fouled up, ”
said the 5'9,185-pound center glee-
fully, "ﬁnd that gave me a good
exuuse to get out.

Goldacker says he was fed up on
hazing, southern style.

‘What the Hell’

"Besides our brother rat duties
(shine shoes, make beds, clean
rooms), we had to run up and down
the stairs of the barracks, even
after football practice.

“One day my buddy caught his

they only said it was tough, but
“what the hell.”

Being a football player, Goldie
had certain privileges. But he
still had to do such stunts as
standing on a radiator with his
overcoat on and doing the gun
manual.

Now, incidentally, he is in the
ROTC at Pitt. ,

Transfer Student Finds

 ‘Pitt’s an Adventure’

BNANNROMAN.

DAYS

for

Pitt comes out on the long end in comparisons made by two
co-ed transfer students with their former schools.

"Pitt is an adventure for a transfer student,” says Arlene
Rubenstein, formerly of the University of Wisconsin.

Miss Rubenstein pointed out that campus life at her former
school was, in a sense artificial, because the students were so
far removed from the wear and tear
of every day life. The tone of the University and

Theif T00“? and board was Paid its cultural differences were not the
in advance, the events of the only things the girls liked. They

found the social life here more
varied. ‘‘
Lives Happily Ever After

She soon became accustomed,
however, to meeting new people
every day on luncheon dates and in
the Tuck Shop.

“At Syracuse you automatically
become a member of a group either
through the dormitory in which you
live or throughyour sorority.

Here .one can choose because
there is no strong dormitory ties.
Yes, I would say Pitt is unique in

many respects.” Ir?

outside world seemed to be far re-
moved from their immediate orbit,
and the most pressing problem they
had to face was whether their team
would win its next game.

Not So At Pitt

"Here at Pitt, things are a little
different. The students seem totake
an interest in current affairs and
apply them to their class room dis-
cussion.

Louise Grodon thought that the
greatest difference between Pitt and
Syracuse, her former alma mater, is
the broadness of Pitt's cultural
program.

She claims that the University’s
atmosphere is more cosmopolitan.
“By that 1 mean, the students are
not confined to just a small area
but have the freedom of the_city.'
You can tell it in their ideas and
interests.
