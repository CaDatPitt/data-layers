HARRISBURG + First, the state Liquor

:2 Control Board asked retailers to voluntarily
' stop selling “alcohol energy drinks,” such as

Four Loko, that have high amounts of liquor
and caffeine in them. i

Now, a state legislator from Philadelphia is
uppingthe ante, vowingto introduce abill in the
legislative session that starts injanuary to ban
the sale of such drinks, which are sometimes
called “blackout in a can” or “liquor cocaine.”

Democratic Rep. VanessaLowery Brown said j

such drinks have “sickened people throughout

' the country, particularly college students.”
She added, “We are seeing more and more ,

circumstantial evidence that these products
are dangerous. Combining alcohol and caffeine
leads to people who don’t realize how drunk
they are, and the outcome could be uagic. It’s
time to take a proactive approach here in Penn-
sylvania.” 

Jerry W. Waters, Sr., the LCB’s regulatory af-
fairs director, Wrote to beverage retailers, earlier
this month, asking them to voluntarily halt the
sale of such drinks until the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration can determine if they are safe.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt to take on
Rhode Island

Both teams start 104th season

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

Last year, most of the college basketball
world had low expectations for the Pitt men’s
basketball team, as the Panthers were picked
to ﬁnish ninth intheir conference by the Big

‘East coaches and were not ranked in any

national polls.

But Pitt surprised everyone and ﬁnished
second in the conference. Now, Pitt will open
the 2010-11 season tonight with much higher
national outlook. Not only were the Panthers
picked to win the Big East, but the AP also
ranks them No. 5 in the nation. “I think all
of our expectations ‘are high,” Pitt forward
Gilbert Brown said. “The goal is to exceed
all those expectations that everyone puts out
there for us and to do something special.”

The Panthers will have an early chance
to prove themselves tonight when they host
Rhode Island at the Petersen Events Center
at 7 p.m.

_ The Rams have been one of the more
consistent programs in the Atlantic 10 over
the past 10 years. They have had ﬁve 20-win
seasons, and since 2007, Rhode Island has
been one of the nation’s best offensive teams.
It is 7th nationally in ﬁeld goals per game
(28.4), 10th in points per game (78.6) and
10th in total ﬁeldgoals made during that
stretch (2,922). - .

Much of that success can be attributed to
head coachjim Baron, who is in his 10th sea-
son coaching the Rams. Baron is no stranger
to Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon.

when he was in St. Bonaventure, and also

Student group continuesllsraeli-Palestinian debate

Amy Friedenberger
Staﬁ" Writer

An Israeli journalist, blogger and ﬁlmmaker
advocated for non—violence Friday night as he
told a group gathered on campus that the Israeli
government should reconsiderthewayit’s build-
ingawall in the West Bank.

' Joseph Dana, a 29-year-old, spoke to about
100 people gathered in David Lawrence Hall
about the Palestinian popular struggle against
the roughly 440 mile—longwall currently under
constructionby Israel. Danais an active partici-

pant in the activism group Anarchists Against « '

the Wall. His speech was part of an event called
“Smash Israeli Apartheid,” whichwas sponsored
by Students forjustice in Palestine.

“An Israeli speaking about Israel can be

“especially effective,” Pitt SJP member Karina .
Goulordava said. “He has a unique voice and-

he’s unique with certain ideas.”

Dana’s group was established in 2003 in
response to the construction of a barrier in the
West Bank. The group includes Israelis who work
in cooperation with Palestinians in attempts to
use nonviolent protests in a joint effort against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank.‘ I

:.

The organization does not have a solid plat- » I
form of whether it supports a one-state, two-
state or multiple-state solution, Dana said.

Dana is ajewish American living in]erusa-
lern, and he doesn’t consider himselfan anar-
chist, although some self-proclaimed anarchists
have joined the group. He also said he is not a

‘ Zionist, or one who seel<s'to re—establish ajewish

nation in Palestine. _

The object ofDana’s protests — thewall going
up in the West Bank — has its‘ roots in a period
called the Second Intifada, a time of intensiﬁed ’
Palestinian—Israeli violence starting in late 2000.

I Anarchists"  the Wall gained one of
its ﬁrst successes when it joined villagers from
Budrus, in Palestine, in 2004. Through daily
der'non'strations,the villagewas abletopushthe
wall almost completely off of its land. .

This action has led to other villages to use
the same tactics. But, Dana pointed out that the
nonviolent demonstrations sometimes become
violent. . ' V -

“The nonviolent demonstrations exist,butit’s'
just that they are being crushed,” Dana said.

He discussed howunarmed demonstrations
could eventually escalate to include the use of tear
gas, rubber bullets and sometimes real bullets
by Israeli forces. I

Dana said that the military presence can
create a panicked atmosphere. Young children
will begin to throw rocks, which is considered
symbolic. The military often responds by try-
ing to break up the demonstration. He said the
demonstrations’ organizers discourage stone
throwing. ' ‘

“The entire village comes out because it’s re-
ally a popular, civilian struggle,” Dana said.

Dana said he has faced physical violence as
well, and that he was once shot in the leg.

As an Israeli facing Israeli soldiers,I_)a11a is
in_a different position than Palestinians pro-
testing. ‘

“I can go up to :51’ soldier and ask, “What
would your mother think about what you’re
doing, shooting 1o—year—o1ds with bullets?”’
Dana said. -

actions on around the village ofBil’in, northwest
of Ramallah. Much of the village’s agricultural

event sponsored by Students forjustice in Palestine in David Lawrence Hall Friday evening. Dana said that the fence serves its purpose

Journalist advocates
for nonviolent protest

by protecting people from terrorism, but that
he has a problem with where the fence is being
built, on some land that is currently occupied
by Palestinians.

Panthers for Israel President Sam Mellits
wasn’t able to attend the event, but he said the
security barrier is constructed in locations that
are areas of ‘intense conflict and even terror-
ism. Israeli officials have noted that violence
and suicide attacks have declined as a result of
the barrier. . P 7

' In 2004, the International Court ofjustice in
The Hague gave an advisory opinion on Israel’s
construction of the wall, saying it’s “contrary
to international law” and doesn’t justify Israel’s

I security objectives.

Whereas Dana said that oftenhe is portrayed
as a traitor to Israel, he thinks what he is doing
is still pro—Israel because he wants coexistence
between the Israelis and Palestinians. Because
he has been able to work alongside Palestinians,
he thinks this goal is practical.

Dana said that he didn’t want to primarily
focus the event on Palestinian grievances because
he’s not Palestinian.

“What he’s doing is for the betterment of
not just Palestine, but also Israel,” said Pitt SJP
memberjonas Moffat. I '

some are ‘too intoxicated to post right now’

When we found out about the Firefox plugin
designed to prevent drunk postingsxon Face-
book and other websites,'we were excited.
After all, nothing can quite ruin a pleasant
night of drinking like ﬁnding embarrassing
public evidence of it on the Internet the next
afternoon. ,

The plugin is called “The Social Media
Sobriety Test” and is, according to its web-
site, designed to “put an end to the embar-
rassment that follows regrettable, late night
posts with 3 easy steps.”

Users customize their settings to select
which sites they’d like to limit their access
to. Then, they choose the hours during which
they’re most likely to be drunk and, ﬁnally,
they put the plugin to work. During the des-
ignated hours, users must take a test before
logging on to the sites they picked.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Despite our excitement about the plugin,
we noticed a few ways to get around-the
test.

When we tried to log on to Facebook with

the sobriety test installed, we were prompt- .
ed to take a time test —— which required us to _

count to 30 and then press “stop,” all while

being distracted with random numbers pop— .
. ping up on the screen; The time test allows '_
I the page.

a ﬁve-second margin of ‘error.

After passing the test,‘ an optional mes— _-
’ sage can be posted to your Facebook that 
says “[Your name here] is sober or just lucky _ ‘
enough to get past The Social Media Sobri- 
‘: we have our doubts. But we still think the
plugin is well intended and'also pretty hi- V

ety Test.”

Unfortunately, we only had to pass the A
test oncevduring our “designated drunk" a

time.” This could be problematic if you hap-
pen to get drunk after the ﬁrst time you’ve

taken the test. .

When we took the test and failed it — on
purpose — we had the option of posting a
message that said “is too intoxicated to post
right now.” But we were able to erase this

message and type in whatever we wanted ‘

without logging in or passing the test, as well
as eventually choosing the “I’m not drunk
get outta my way,” option at the bottom of

So whereas Mashable wrote that “judging
from the neverending supply of material on

Texts From Last Night, [The Social Media .

Sobriety Test] is probably rather necessary,”

larious. .
Still, we think this technology would be
more useful on things like cars -—— inhibit-

ing a person from driving drunk —- and
underwear: somehow preventing regret-
table drunken hookups while still allowing
bathroom use. In addition, it could be nice
if drunk texting and calling could be elimi-
nated while still allowing users to be able to
call for a ride home or 911 if necessary.

Ultimately, of course, the best way to pre-
vent_ the consequences of a night of partying
is to drink responsibly. I

Capital gets blamed butstill worshipped

Hatred directed at Washington, D.C., doesn’t affect tourist rates _ j I 

t Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

No matter who wins an election, I find

I myself with an.acute case of political

prostration by 'Election Day.

After the elections comes a moment
of calm. In this moment of tranquil-
ity, it is time to have a last laugh about
the elections. And to my mind, nothing

_ is funnier than the split personality of

Americans when it comes to Washing-
ton, D.C.

Washington is a powerful symbol. It
stands for the U.S. government, and how
much it changes lives all over the_world.
It stands for America itself: How many
times have you seen a picture of a bald
eagle in a William McKinley-esque pose,
superimposed on the Capitol dome? It is
a major front of the War on Terrorism,
and the War on Drugs. In an election
year, Washington becomes another kind
of symbol: a symbol of what’s wrong
with America.

Washington means lots of spendi_ng,
bungling, bureaucracy and mismanage-
ment. It means corruption, insider deals
and frustration. '

Running against Washington is pop-
ular for many politicians, even when
the Harrisburg, Springfield, Charles-

I ton or Albany they come from is just as

bad. “Washington insider” is usually
said with a sinister tinge, and one of

. the worst things you can call somebody

these days is a congressman.
So, with all this hatred directed at
Washington, we would expect hardly

anybody to visit it, right? Nothing could =
. Even the British government is referred

be further from the truth. ’

According to the National Park Ser-
vice, 24 million people visitthe National
Mall each year, even when there isn’t

V a sale. A trip to D.C. becomes a sort of ,

pilgrimage for Americans.

When you and your folks felt e_xtreme— ‘
ly patriotic one summer, you likely went '

to D.C. Thus, we have contradictory at-

titudes about our nation’s capital. It is a :
cesspit and a shrine, Sodom, Gomorrah

and Jerusalem all rolled into one.

' This is odd. Mecca would be strange I

indeed ifpeople were supposed to swear
at it five times a day -- and then make
the hajj.

Part of this divided attitude probably I

comes from the fact that Washington is a
made-up city. It wasn’t much before the
Revolution, and would have remained
such had Northerners not stuck a capital
city there to placate Southerners, in an
early example of backroom deals. Its
main purpose was to be the seat of gov-
ernment, and until the Civil War that’s

pretty much allthat it was. -
This probably plays a large role‘ in
our tendency to both swear at and visit
Washington. When a financial crisis
screws up the entire United States, we
don’t say “Oh, New York screwed us.” We
say “Wall'Street screwed us.” We focus
our rage o'n"a speciﬁc district of the city.

to as “Westminster” or ‘fWhitehall,” not
“London.” However, whenever the fed-
eral government irritates us, the raison
d’étre of Washington irritates us.
Furthermore, since Washington is far
away for most of us, it’s easy to think of
it as an‘ almost unreal place, a mythical
fairyland that is, metaphorically and

literally, Oz. We see it on TV all the time, '

but rarely are we there. The more mys-
terious or ethereal a place is, the easier
it is to hate it with the passion that is

‘ reserved" for the abstract. It’s also easy

to make the accusation that “Washing—

ton is out of touch with the American "I

people” when the place doesn’t quite
seem real.

The artificial nature of Washington is
also what makes it such a cool place to
visit. In two miles, from the big honkin’
statue ofAbe Lincoln to the big honkin’
statue of U.S. Grant, you can visit the
Hope Diamond,.two war memorials, the
White House, that most-phallic Washing-

ton Monument, the hilariously large and
probably hard-to-heat Environmental
Protection Agency building, the Apollo
11 command module, one of George
Washington’s coats, and the —— notjust
“a” — Star-Spangled Banner. You can tag
photos on Facebook with corny captions
like “Mark Kozlowski, The Pitt News,
the White House.” If you’re organiz-
ing a protest, you can identify yourself
with the great protesters of history. And

while most of us can never come close.

to holding government power, we can at
least be awed by our proximity to it. And
we can always pretend to be Senators
by walking up the steps of those great

~ neoclassical buildings.

If Washington had any other point
than to be the seat of government, it
wouldn’t have such a density of signifi-
cance.

In fact, when Washington wasn’tjust
a capital but a large military base, rail-
road hub and fortress during the Civil
War, it wasn’t so tidy. V

If Washington had been a ‘city that
just happened to be the capital, or if
Philadelphia were the capital city, we
wouldn’t feel so strongly about it. But,
as a city of, by and for the government,
we are condemned to despise and visit
it repeatedly.

LEX AND THE CITY

 

Advice from an Adam Sandler movie

Because maybe the best advice comes from movies and television

Lexie Bond
Assistant Opinions Editor

 

It only takes a couple of “Ahhh, very nice”es
to realize how annoying overused movie
quotes can be. There is even a Facebook
group called “quoting movies excessively
ruins the joke.” Personally, I would like
to dropkick anyone who pulls out a “Run,
Forrest, run!” or a “Houston, we have a
problem.”

Despite this, I will admit that I speak
in movie and television quotes. My sisters
and I actually have entire conversations in
movie quotes. Even my family dog is named

"after a line from Friends — when Phoebe

changes her name to Princess Consuela Ba-
nana Hammock. I mean, we call her Nana
for short, but even that is just ripping off the
name of the dog from Peter Pan 

And while all the other Pitt News editors
were trying to have a serious editorial meet-
ing about voting, all I could think of was the

Family Guy line, “Ohh hot, she’s voting,” ‘

from when Peter watched old—fashioned
“pornography” of a dirty ﬂapper girl.
For the longest time, I thought I was so

clever for always being able to come up with
an appropriate movie or TV line for any
conversation. Now, of course, I realize that
I’m simply jacking these lines and insert-
ing them where my own original thoughts
should be. ‘

Maybe I’m not actually even funny, and

' I just watch too much TV.

And what good can really come of watch-
ing too much TV? »

    

Unless of course, we can really ﬁnd all
the answers in big and small screen refer-
ences.

This hypothesis needs to be put to the
test. If there really is any movie that has
all the answers, it has to be Billy Madison
(BM). .

Let’s apply the wisdom of the Adam San-
dler ﬁlm to college.

‘splendors’ of Vatican reach ’Burgh

Ryan McGinnis
Staﬁ” Writer

“Vatican Splendors: AJourney through
Faith and Art” , .
Features Michelangelo, Bernini, Guer-
cino ‘ .
Senatorjohn Heinz History Center
1212 Smallman St.

Now-Jan. 9, 2011

Tickets $17

412-454-6000

Some of the world’s greatest works of art are
housed in European museums, and expens-
es for airfare, hotels, food, transportation,
admission -— you get the idea —— generally
stand in the way of glimpsing something
Michelangelo touched. '

But from now throughJan.' 9, visitors to
The Senatorjohn Heinz History Center can
see some objects on loan from the Vatican
without having to ﬂyto Rome.

The exhibition, called “Vatican Splen-
dors: A Journey through Faith and Art,”
features paintings, sculptures, documents

and other curiosities that illustrate the long
and intricate history of Christianity.

“Of course, there’s nothing like seeing,

the Vatican ﬁrst hand, but this is the next
best thing,” Ned Schano, the history cen-
ter’s director of communications said of the
exhibit, the largest in the center’s history.

“Vatican Sp1endors” takes visitors
through 2,000 years of Christianity, be-
ginning with reliquaries said to house
the remains of Saints Peter and Paul, and
ending with objects related to the contem-
porary Papacy. In between, visitors will
see artifacts from the Christianization of
Rome and a succession of representations
of Biblical ﬁgures, from the 14th century
to our own. V

The paintings displayed include Guer-
cino’s “Portrait of Christ with Crown of
Thorns,” which depicts Jesus en route to
Golgotha.

“This image was among the ﬁrst to
portray Jesus as we see him today, with
the beard and the crown of thorns,” said
Brady Smith, communications manager at
the center. “It’s also interesting because it

represents the Veil of Veronica, which, ac-
cording to Christian mythology, is a piece
of cloth that retained an image ofJesus’ face
after he wiped himself with it.”

Moreover, Guercino’s image is a land-
mark in realist iconography.

“The painting is incredibly lifelike, down
to the drops of blood,” Smith said. With his
bloodshot eyes and devastated expression,
Guercino’s Jesus makes a striking impres-
sion. ’ ‘

Also of interest are two golden angels
from Bernini’s workshop, “a piece of the
15th century Ciborium of Sixtus IV depict-
ing Saint Peter’s cruciﬁxion and a host of
ornate, liturgical objects dating from the
Napoleonic period.

Of course, no Renaissance exhibit would
be complete without Michelangelo. “Vati-
can Splendors”. features a to-scale cast of
his “Pieta,” tools used in the painting of
the Sistine Chapel, a reproduction of his
workplace environment and a bas-relief
executed when he was in his 80s.

ANALYSIS

‘Slasher’
prompts
panel    
Experts discuss feminism

Tracey Hickey
For The Pitt News

Allison Moore’s “Slasher” asks a lot of questions
about feminism, family, sex and the horror
genre, but it does not provide easy answers
— or any at all. '

As deftly and outrageously as “Slasher”
tackles clichés surrounding women in horror
movies, it also exposes clichés concerning the
way we think about female power and exploi-
tation. V

Nearly every character is an exaggeration of
astereotype that occurs in feminist discourse:
The sleazy male horror movie director; the
complicit male bystander; the raging second-
wave feminist who believes all depictions of
sex are misogynistic; the young, nubile “post-
feminist” who doesn’t think pandering to male

lust on camera is degrading if she negotiates a?

‘good price for it. '
A panel of experts discussed the play’s
themes immediately following its performance
yesterday. Film studies graduate student Ve-
ronica Fitzpatrick, theater department profes-
sor Dr. Lisajackson-Schebetta, women’s stud-
ies professor Dr. Frayda Cohen and sociology
professor Dr. Christine Whelan examined the
show from several angles, but many of their
best insights emerged as they looked at the
play as an allegory for the tension between
the second wave of feminism “and whatever
comes after.” '
The second wave of feminism, most active in
the 1970s, was often criticized for being“anti—
sex.” More moderate feminists were especially
alienated when second-wave feminist leaders
like Andrea Dworkin teamed up with Christian

fundamentalists —— not known for their pro-

gressive -ideas about gender —- to campaign
for the banning of pornography.

' This union is explicitly satirized in “Slasher”
when Frances, the protagonist Sheena’s radical
second-wave feminist mother who is conﬁned
to awheelchair, teams up with the fundamental-
ists who bombed an abortion clinic to stop the
production of a sexually degrading horror ﬁlm,

_“Bloodbath,” by bombing the set. But, the play

also alludes to the feminist debate about por-

nography and sex work in more subtle ways.
“It deals with the tension between choice

and coercion,” Fitzpatrick said, describing the

Staff Writer

Sometimes, even a coffee shop can inspire

‘ a life-changing experience.’ i I

As I sat in Kiva Han,is_lipping on my
vanilla soy latte out of an eco-friendly
cup, I couldn’t help but notice how dif-

ferent the crowd was from the Starbucks I 

or Caribou set. At. bothgof these shops,
the vibe is ‘much more mainstream and

Suddenly, I felt this uncontrollable
need to wear a fedora, brush up on my

. Allen Ginsberg and start smoking herbal —

ciga.r.ettes..—= « — ~ - . ..  .
For several years, my wardrobe of
collared shirts,‘ loafers and cardigans-

in neutral colors has suited me just fine.

 

But now, my previously reliable clothing
seems too commercial. ,
This begs the question: To be or not

L to be —— a hipster, that is. V ,

Sure, I’ve bought my fair share of lace
tops from Urban Outﬁtters and several
pairs of leggings from American Appar-
el — one of which is made out of black
pleather, or plastic leather. But, I real-
ized that if I wanted to reinvent myself
as a hipster — or at least dress like one
— I would have to fully commit to my
cause.

Just like every other style or trend, you
don’t need to go overboard to carry out
the look. Instead, you should incorporate
aspects that work well with your own
wardrobe. To do so, you have to consider
the three rules that come with every trend
or fad:

1. Unless you’re Anna Wintour or Karl
Lagerfeld, you’re probably not a fashion

god. You have no way of knowing how '

long a certain trend might be in style, so

 

you should choose pieces that are practi-
cal and timeless. _ ' ‘ *
2. Always dress for your body." Too
many fashion victims make the mistake
of following a trend to the T, evenwhen it
{ifail/s toflatter their bodies and accentuate
’-their best features. Just because it looks
 great on the runway doesn’t mean it will

modelspawned a child, that chlildfwould
‘ not only be painfully attractive and musi-
cally inclined, but it would probably grow

) up to be ah-ipster. So before you blow -

- . your. paycheck on vegan cookbooks and a

 new nose ring, remember that aihipst'er’s

‘ style is all about basics and playing with

proportions. 1
Try pairing charcoal skinny jeans with
a white v—neck T-shirt, a leather motor-
cycle jacket and ankle boots with a de-
cent-sized heel. If you want to make the
outﬁt more feminine, and if you’re feeling
adventurous, swap the tee for a rufﬂed
chiffon topin white or a pastel. If you’re
. looking for a more casual angle, opt for a
loose-ﬁtting red ﬂannel shirt paired with
black leggings, afitted, cropped cardigan
and pointy flats. To accessorize, contrast
the simplicity of the outfit by adding a
. chunky scarf, dangly earrings and a cross
body messenger bag. V
So, my aspiring hipsters, I hope I’ve
inspired you to register for an art history
course, buy an obscure CD or shop for
vintage clothing. As for this columnist,
I know I’m well overdue for a new hobby
— you’ll probably ﬁlnd me on East Car-
son this weekend sporting impeccable
clothes, a new tattoo and a shopping bag
from the Culture Shop.

Exhibit draws Catholics

Center predicts strong turnout from Western Pennsylvanians

Courtesy Citta del Vaticano

’ “Bustof an Angel” is one of the many artworks that explores Christianhistory in the
Senatorjohn Heinz History Center’s “Vatican Splendors” exhibit.

Vatican 4 9

“One of the things visitors have told me
they’ve enjoyed is the closeness our exhibit
offers,” Smith said, in reference to the “Pi-
eta.” The original, world—famous sculpture,
which depicts Mary holdingjesus after his

death, is encased in bulletproof glass in the '

Vatican, but the exhibit’s cast allows visi-
tors to stand inches from an exact likeness
of the work — close enough to see subtle
details like Michelangelo’s signature on
Mary’s clothes. E

Smith said 60 percent of Western Penn-
sylvania residents identify as Catholic, and
Pittsburgh is home to the second—largest
diocese in America.

“Because of the demographics, this sort
of exhibit really sells itself,” he said.

A special draw for religious visitors is
a cast of the late Pope John Paul II’s hand,

which can be touched.

“I’ve actually seen people weep when
putting their hand injohn Paul II’s cast. He
was a generation’s pope,” Schano said. “N ev-
ertheless, the exhibit isn’t just for Christians
—— it’s designed for people interested in art
history, religious history and just the his-
tory of the last 2,000 years.”

Western Pennsylvanians speciﬁcally
might be interested to see a number of
objects of local interest at the exit of the
exhibit, including religious works by Andy
Warhol and a large painting from the Vati-
can that hung in a Heinz factory for many
years.

“This is the biggest exhibit the History
Center’s ever had, in terms of both square
footage and regional importance,” Smith
said. ~

“‘At the end, Sheena says her mother saved

 of “Bloodbath” is about to assault Sheena],
' but only because she was trying to kill ‘her in

the ﬁrst place! Isn’t that the quintessential

. mother—daughter relationship?” Whelan said.

“Your mother is both your role model and the

. enemy.” —

Thepanelists agreed that Sheena and Fran-
ces’s relationship is meant to ﬁmction both as
an illustration of typical coming—of—age ten-
sion that occurs when a daughterchooses to
embrace her sexuality, and as an allegory for
the conflicts between the puritanical second
wave of feminism and the more “pro—sex” third
wave. A

Even Frances’s disability is symbolic, Cohen
argued.

“One could say that since the failure to pass
the Equal Rights Amendment, [the feminist

movement] has been hobbled  and so we start '

out the play with this hobbled second—wave
feminist,” she said.

Neither Sheena, who ends the play in a leg
cast and a stiletto, limping off to a press confer-
ence to promote a ﬁlm that led to her mother’s
death, nor Frances, who is gored in the neck
by a power drill while trying to protect her
daughter from sexual assault, is a particularly
inspiring vision of female power. But]ackson—
Schebetta believes there may be hope for the

V future of the feminist movement in the char-

acter of Sheena’s sister, Hildy.

Hildy, who throughout all the narrative’s
madness remains focused on soccer and SAT
preparation, “is not on either track,”Jackson—
Schebetta said. “She isnit scripted completely
— in a lot of scenes she’s just watching, she

doe_sn’t say anything — but she’s taking care V

of herself, and there’s the suggestion that she
maybe has other options. But for how long?
Until she realizes that she can use her body
for something?” I

VOLLEYBALL

Pitt falls to top Big teams

Torie Wytiaz ‘L

‘ l ‘ Staff Writer

Going into perhaps its toughest weekend of
the season, the Pitt volleyball team was con-
ﬁdent that it could match its competition.

As they welcomed Louisville and Cincin— .

nati —— the premier Big East teams ,— to
the Fitzgerald Field House, the Panthers,
according to senior mid"clle hitter Imani
Harper, were prepared for a win. L

“We have had such a tough season that I
am not sure that Louisville and Cincinnati
know what’s coming for them,” Harper said

” before the matches. “We are hungry for a

big win.”

, That hunger, however, did not result in
victories for the Panthers, as they fell in
four sets to the Cardinals and in three sets
to the Bearcats.

Louisville 3, Pitt 1 ,

Despite stretches of high-level play, the
Panthers were unable to defeat Louisville,
the second place team in the Big East, on
Saturday '

The Panthers fell to their conference op-
ponent with scores of 25-18, 25-21 and 25-19
in the ﬁrst, second and fourth sets, respec-
tively. Pitt won the third set 25-18.

‘?In the third set, we were playing good
volleyball, winning key rallies,” head coach
Toby Rens said. “We played well throughout
the match, but in the sets we lost, we kind
of let Louisville off the hook.”

An example of the Panthers’ strong play
was seen in the blocking totals, as Pitt re-
corded nine blocks to Louisville’s eight.

“Louisville is actually the best block-
ing team in the Big East,” Rens said. “I was
pleased with our efforts at the net but un-
fortunately it did not lead to a win.”

Part of the blocking success was because
of lineup changes, which gave sophomore
outside hitter Alexa Campbell her ﬁrst
start.

Campbell earned 10 kills in the match
and ﬁnished with a .269 hitting clip, a ﬁg-
ure that Rens correlates with an impressive
match. V ‘ _

“Alexa’s performance was great for us,
especially as a sophomore,” he said. “Her
hitting percentage on the day was well above
.200 which is difficult to do against a strong
blocking team like Louisville.”

The sophomore class was also well-rep-
resented on defense by Margy Acton, who
led the Panthers with 14 digs.

But, the Cardinals, led by outside hitter
Lola Arslanbekova’s 20 kills, managed to

AN OLTMANNS’ OPINION

How Pitt can
make the  
Final Four

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

The Pitt men’s basketball team will be-
gin the regular season tonight against‘
Rhode Island, marking the start of an-
other highly anticipated season for the
team. Expectations abound for the squad,
which ranked in the top five in both major_
preseason polls, the AP and the Big East
coaches poll..

The team’s roster is loaded with talent,
but a few questions remain. If answered
positively, the Panthers could very well
find themselves in Houston for the Final
Four.

1. Can Pitt replace Jermaine Dixon’s;
defensive presence?

The only starter not returning for this
season, Dixon was the team’s best defend-
er last season. He guarded the opposing
teams’ best perimeter player every game
and was the leader of the Pitt team. But
the Panthers think that their returning
guards will pick up the defensive slack.

Guards Ashton Gibbs, Brad Wana-
maker and Travon Woodall all have been
in head coach Jamie Dixon’s system long
enough to understand the emphasis he
puts on defense. Woodall added muscle;
to his frame and made defense a point of
emphasis this summer.

“Coach Dixon’s been talking to me
about getting pressure on the ball, and
he wants me to be that defensive player,

Woodall said. . t

2. Can Gary McGhee take the next step
in his offensive development?

The senior center has improved every
season over the past three years. Known
as a premier defender, McGhee’s offensivesv
game continues to evolve. Last year, he
averaged 6.9 points and 6.8 rebounds
in his first year as a starter. He attended
Amar’e~Stoudemire’s camp for forwards
and centers and was invited to the LeB—
ron James Skills Academy this summe’ra__
where he worked on his offensive game,

Questions Pitt needs to answer to make the Final Four

developing new techniques. '

“I tried to work on a lot of footwork

stuff,_working on moves, a lot of hook
shots,” McGhee said. “It was a good ex-
perience to learn some things.”

1 3. Can Dante Taylor live up to ex-
pectations? ' '

Taylor came to Pitt last year as one
of the most highly touted recruits in the
country after playing in the McDonald’s
All—American Game in high school. As a
freshman, Taylor struggled at times, av-
eragingjust 4.1 points and 3.7 rebounds
per game last season.

But he transformed his body this sum-
mer by adding more muscle and turned
in several impressive performances in
the Greentree Summer League. He looks
primed to have a bounce-back year.

4. Will Pitt’s promising young players
emerge?

The Panthersare deep this year. The
team has enough talent to play 11 play-
ers consistently, but that isn’t realistic.

Indiana (Pa.).

So the question that remains is which
players out of the group of bench play-
ers —].]. Richardso'n,].]. Moore, Lamar
Patterson and Talib Zanna — will step up
and receive signiﬁcant playing time. All
of those players have shown the ability
to contribute, but it looks like Moore is
ready to play right away and Zanna could
very well be Pitt’s best rebounder.

5. Can this Pitt team ﬁnally get over
that elusive Final Four hurdle?

_Pitt hasn’t made it to a Final Four since
1941 — and that was before the modern"
tournament. But the team has come so
close several times throughout the last
decade. Its best shot was two years ago,
but it lost to Villanova at the buzzer on
Scottie Reynolds’ infamous layup. _

The Panthers have made it to the Sweet
16 five times in the last decade. But could
this be the year they achieve that elusive
Final Four berth? _

It will take a while to see how these
questions will be answered, but we’ll get
our first glimpse of the Panthers in a game
that counts tonight. I

Despite defense, Pitt falls

secure the victory and improve their Big

East record to 10-1 as Pitt fell to 5-6 in the
conference. » ‘ ' -

Cincinnati 3, Pitt 0

Going into the match against the No.
21 Bearcats, Rens was aware of the level of
competition that the Panthers would face.

“Cincinnati has one of the best outside
hitters in [senior] Stephanie Niemer,” he
said. “On top of that, they also have an excel‘-
lent middle hitting attack as well.” *

Those aspects of Cincinnatiis game
proved to be the difference in the match

' as Niemer ﬁnished the "match with 13 kills
. and'sophomore middle hitter Becca Refenes
It cdntributjedllio kills and three blocks to

the offensive effort as the Bearcats‘ beat the

Panthers yesterday by set scores of 25-14, V

25-16 and 25-20. .

Harper led the Panthers with 12 kills 77

and senior outside hitter Amy Town col-
lected 10 kills.

_ Rens had hoped that the Panthers’ de- _,
fense would lead to a victory, as the defense "
A has been a constant strength for the Pitt

team.

compete with any team.” he said. “When
both our defense and offense work together,
that’s whenwe are at our best.” i ‘
Acton led the Panthers with 10 digs, and
the Panthers collected 36 digs as a team.
Still, the Bearcats managed to surpass
the Panthers in kills, digs and ultimately the

match as Cincinnati fortiﬁed its position at _

the top of the Big East Conference.
The Panthers were not able to capitalize

on their home-court advantage over the V

weekend, which disappointed both Harper

“and Rens. , ;,., . e e

“We had a nice crowd this weekend,”
Rens said. “It was frustrating_that we could
not pull out a win forythe :fans.”.‘

Harper echoed-those senti1nents,ibut re-

- « mained hopeﬁiljthat Pitt’s ﬁnaltwo matches
against Connecticut and St. ]ohn’s will be V
 more successful. '

“Having these last matches athome will

be huge for us,” Harper said. “We are more .

comfortable at home and we know the court

0 well. Itpfis a serious matter of pride.” I

Men’s Basketball 4 1

Rhode Island. So we’re familiar with him,”
Dixon said at a news conference. “He’s a good
friend and Irespect him immensely with how
he’s built programs.” A

Dixon respects Baron so much that the

. Rhode Island coach has had some inﬂuence
' on Pitt’s coaching staff. *

“We’ve hired a couple guys that he recom-
mended over the years —' Coach [Joe] Lombardi
and Coach [Pat] Skerry.” I

Lombardi is now the head coach at Indi-
ana (Pa.), which the Panthers defeated 73-56
Thursday night. ~

The Rams are one of the tougher teams that _

the Panthers have opened a season against.

“Go look at the ﬁrst weekand you’ll prob-
ably not see_two teams this good playing against
each other in the ﬁrst week of the season,”
Dixon said. “Nobody of our caliber is playing
ateam of their caliber.” A

Last year, the Rams ﬁnished 26-10 and
made it all the way to the Final Four of the Na-
tional Invitation Tournament before falling to
North Carolina. Dixon attributes their success
to senior point guard Marquisjones and senior
forward Delroyjames.

Last year, Jones ﬁnished 22nd nationally in
assist-to-tumover ratio with2.52:1, andjames
is the team’s top returning scorer with 10.5
points per game. ' , '

“Jones does a good job running their team,
andjames is a guy that can make some things
happen on his own,” Dixon said. “He likes to

takepeople off the dribble and they try to create

some matchup problems.”

Both teams are kicking off their 104th sea-
son. Pitt has a 70-33 record in season openers
and is currently riding a 47-game home win-
ning streak against nonconference opponents.
Rhode Island is 83-20 in openers, and Baron
has a 9-11 record against Big East opponents.

Dan Szramowski, Rhode Island’s direc-
tor of basketball operations, said his team
would be ready for the Pete’s atmosphere,
since the Rams have played in some of
the nation’s most hostile environments.
“The place will be packed,” Szramowski said
at a news conference. “It will remind the guys
who were here last year of when we went down
to Virginia Tech for the NIT.”

The Rams won that game 76-64.

“Especially for the guys who were here back
when we played at Duke, they know the atmo-
sphere. they are walking into,” he said. “They
know the caliber of the team thatwe are about

»to play and they really know what it takes to

get it done.”

The Panthers also know what it takes to get
a win, but they will have to battle some injuries
and missed practices if they want to keep their
nonconference winning streak alive.‘

Center Gary McGhee missed some practices
over the weekend for approved personal rea-
sons, and Nasir Robinson will be out three to

‘Panthers battling injuries, missed practices

sixweeks because of a knee injury. Brown is just
returning from missing two weeks of practice
because of an injury.

Dixon said Brown’s lack of practice showed
in the exhibition game against Indiana (Pa.).

“I decided that we really had to get 20 min-
utes [of playing time] out of him no matter what,
and he played like a guy who hasn’t played in
two weeks,” Dixon said. “But I think he looked
more comfortable [Saturday]. He had a good
practice.”

But battling missed practices is nothing new
for Dixon.

“Every day there’s been something new,”
he ‘said. “Oftentimes, things are not within our
control, with injuries and things that come up.
1 They have lives and that is part of college has-

V ketball.” 1 . l

Dixon plans on starting the same group
that started Thursday, which means Brown,
Ashton Gibbs, McGhee, Brad Wanamaker and
Talib Zarma will likely tip off the season for
the Panthers. A _

The game is part of the 2K Sports Classic

which will also see Pitt host Illinois- Chicago
on Wednesday before taking on Maryland at
a Madison Square Garden in New York. Nov. 18
