Talk to a Pitt student who
lives off campus and the con-
versation is likely to turn to
cockroaches, lack of hot water,
inflated prices and landlords
who refuse to fix anything. It
seems everyone has a tale to
tell.

There are more students than
university housing units at Pitt,
so many students live in off-
campus housing, mostly in
Oakland, Shadyside or Squirrel
Hill.

With a high demand for
apartments near campus and a
fixed number of units, the sup-
ply-demand curve bulges away
from quality, affordable hous-
ing. Many students are stuck in
run—down apartments that are
relatively expensive. The prob-
lem is exacerbated by the fact
that many students may be
unfamiliar with neighborhoods

PiH’s PR guru juggles complaints, media

By Tracey Katz
For The Pitt News

It wasn’t supposed to be like
this. Instead of sitting in a cor-
ner office on the fifth ﬂoor of
Craig Hall, writing a press
release or talking to a TV
reporter, Ken Service was sup-
posed to be sitting in the cock-
pit of the space shuttle.

Growing up in Brooklyn,
New York, Pitt’s director of
communications thought he
was going to be an astronaut.
But something happened on
his way to the moon.

“I wanted to be a pilot,” said

Service. “But because I didn’t
have 20/20 vision, I could only
be a navigator or something
else, so I had to change my
aspirations.”

Instead, Service attended
Canisius College in Buffalo,
N.Y., for English. He wrote for
the school newspaper and
eventually became the editor.

After college, he considered
teaching but, following a trial
run, decided to stick with
English. His search began with
the want-ads of the local news-
paper, where he came across
an opening which would later
jumpstart his career in public

relations.

The ad was placed by the
public relations department at
his alma mater, Canisius.

“Paul Kane, the man who
hired me right over the phone,
knew me from when I had
worked on the paper in col-
lege,” said Service. ,

He also said that Kane was a
great mentor and taught him a
lot about how to make it in
public relations.

“He gave me just enough
leeway to make mistakes and
learn from them.”

Following his job at

Canisius, Service worked as .

public relations director for the
University of Cincinnati,
Carnegie Mellon University
and Duquesne. In 1994,
Service came to work for Pitt
as director of communications.

He acts as the university’s
spokesperson, working with
outside media sources to make
the public. both local and
national, aware of what’s hap-
pening at Pitt.

“lt’s my job to explain or
answer any question the news
media may have about this uni-
versity,” said Service.

WASHINGTON -
American officials, while
playing down the threat posed
by North Korea’s sudden
round of violations of the mil-
itary armistice that keeps the
peace between the two
Koreas, said that they were
baffled by the message that
Pyongyang was trying to
send.

They presume that North
Korean troop movements
inside the two—and—a-half mile
wide demilitarized zone are
part of a continuing effort to
undermine the 1953 Military
Armistice Agreement and to
push the United States into
bilateral peace negotiations
with Pyongyang. Yet they
think the timing is symbolic,
possibly aimed at the parlia-
mentary elections in South
Korea this week and a brief
visit there planned by
President Clinton.

Hillel “the Elder” asked,
“If I am not for myself,
who is for me? If I care
only for myself, what am I?
If not now, when?” What
does it mean to be our-

What is in the self-interest

E. Gordon Gee, president

In college towns all across the United States, students are
crammed into many off-campus residences that are often sub-
standard at best and hazardous at worst. Pitt is no exception.
However, some schools, like Fairmont State College in
Fairmont, W.Va., and the University of Florida in Gainesville,
have programs for student renters.

The college in the town of Fairmont instituted a rental reg-
istration program in 1991. Prompted by student complaints,
the program compels all property owners to register with the

compliance with building and occupancy codes.

The rental registration ordinance applies to all rental
dwelling units in the city except those that are owner occu-
pied, college-run dormitories and transient commercial prop-
erties such as motels. The terms of the ordinance are directed
strongly toward public safety issues such as installation of
smoke detectors, guaranteeing of sound electrical wiring sys-
tems and ensuring that the building is not in disrepair.

Each property owner is charged an inspection fee of $10
per year per unit with fee reductions provided for large apart-
ment buildings. A certificate of use and occupancy is kept in
the Office of Student Affairs of all rentals which adhere to this
program.

In 1991, the program had six cards on file of landlords
who met the school’s requirements. Today, the file boasts over
100 cards. Emma Matheny, secretary of Fairmont’s Student
Affairs Department, said, “The
program has worked out
extremely well over the years.

In the March issue of American Health
magazine, Dr. Eugene N. Myers, Dr.
Jonas T. Johnson, Dr. Thomas A.
Medsger Jr, Dr. Charles Reynolds IH, Dr.
Bartley P. Grifﬁth and Dr. Thomas Starzl
were listed among the 1,019 best doctors
in the nation.

Myers is‘a professor and the chairman
of the Otolaryngology Department,
which concerns the treatment of ear, nose
and throat ailments.

psychiatry, the study of mental and emo-
tional disorders, and a professor of neu-
rology, the treatment of problems affect-
ing the brain, nerves and the spinal cord.

Griffith is the chief of cardiothoracic
surgery at the med-
ical center. In 1980,
he joined the univer-
sity’s heart transplan-
tation program, and
he, along with the
rest of the transplant
team, have trans-
planted over 600

tory when he performed two baboon-to-
human liver transplants. He has received
more then 130 awards and honors
throughout his career, including 17 hon-
orary doctorates from universities around
the world.

The doctors
were chosen from a
panel of department
heads in more than
60 specialties in over
350 hospitals
throughout the
nation.

The panel was
asked one simple
question to deter-
mine who was the
best of the best:
Which doctor would
you go to or send your family to for treat-
ment in each particular specialty?

The decision was based not only on
their outstanding medical credentials but

also on their “patient friendly” attitudes
and willingness to teach up-and-coming
medical students.

Three UPMC physicians are also hon-
ored in this month’s issue of Good
Housekeeping. Dr. Arthur Feldman, Dr.
L. Dade Lunsford and Griffith were
among the 357 doctors honored.

Feldman is the chief of cardiology, a
Harry S. Tack professor of medicine and
the director of the Pittsburgh Heart
Institute. He specializes in the causes of
heart failure and has been instrumental in
determining the molecular and clinical
aspects of congestive heart failure.

Lunsford is a professor and interim
chairman of neurological surgery, profes-
sor of oncology and co-director of the
Center for Image-Guided Neurosurgery
at UPMC. He is responsible for bringing
the Gamma Knife, a minimally invasive
form of brain surgery, to the university,
which was the first center in the United
States to offer this procedure to patients.

These doctors were
named by a panel of 260
department chairs from major
medical centers across the
United States.

Even the Irish couldn't escape the trial of the century

By Katie Delaney
Staff Writer

I thought that being an ocean
away from the United States
might help me escape the OJ.
Simpson trial. After all,
Simpson is an American foot-
ball hero, an American public
figure and, depending on what
you believe, an American wife-
abuser and an American mur-
derer. He’s an American legend,
though for some a hero and for
others a tragedy.

So why did I see Simpson
staring me in the face with his
sly grin when I went to purchase
a newspaper at University
College Dublin’s campus conve-
nience store the day after the
verdict? He made the front page
of Ireland’s two main newspa-
pers, The Irish Times and The
Irish Independent , not only the
day after the verdict, but many
times throughout the next week:
“Why we had to let 0.]. walk
free — jurors,” “Defense ‘dream
team’ splits on race,” “Why we
cleared Simpson,” “Simpson
may get joint custody of chil-
dren” — the list goes on.

The Simpson verdict came
during Fresher’s Week, when all
of UCD’s clubs and organiza-
tions set up stands in the hall-
ways of the Arts Block, which is
the main classroom building at

_ UCD (and which could only

dream of shedding its 19605
Eastern European architecture to
match the magnificence, in
structure, architectural style and
detail of the Cathedral of
Learning).

I was walking by one of the
lecture halls, comparable to the
size of those in David Lawrence
at Pitt, and happened to look in,

only to see that an overhead pro-
jector was magnifying a picture
of Simpson with his smile and
clenched fist. Next to the over-
sized picture were capital block
letters reading: GET AWAY
WITH MURDER. Below that
phrase it said in smaller letters:
join the ﬁlm society.

When I passed the film soci-
ety’s booth, I overheard the stu-
dent who was accepting mem-
berships say that the only reason
Simpson got off is because of
his race. I approached her to tell
her that I’d heard what she said
and I was curious how she came
to that conclusion. “Just because
racial tension is so high in
America. I’ve never been there,
but I hear that most whites over
there hate blacks.” When I start-
ed to dig deeper into her frame
of mind, she stumbled upon
words to form a few sentences
and then refused to continue our
conversation.

I wasn’t annoyed that this
woman expressed her opinion; I
was annoyed that.she expressed
her opinion without having solid
grounds on which to base it. She
agreed with the gossip instead of
educating herself to form an
opinion based on knowledge. It
may be that race is the final
expression in defining human
differences, and certainly the
problems of American blacks
are no secret. Yet, this woman’s
statement reflected her igno-
rance about the vast spectrum of
issues this trial had dug up.

The roots of many factors
other than race came into play in
those months, among them
domestic abuse, raw violence,
social class, fame and custody of
children.

have an opinion about whether
or not Simpson is guilty, regard-
less of the verdict. The Sunday
Independent records show that
six out of 10 people will remem-
ber that Simpson had a “reason”
to kill, no alibi and a plethora of
DNA evidence (his blood as
well as Nicole Brown Simpson’s
and Ronald Goldman’s blood at
Nicole’s estate, in his Ford
Bronco and in his house) that
tied him to the murders.

One in 10 will base their “not
guilty” votes on sloppy evidence
gathering on the part of the
LAPD coupled with the proba-
bility that the search of Nicole’s
property (which disclosed the
“bloody glove”) was illegal, to
rid Simpson of conviction.

With all the chatter in Ireland
revolving around the Simpson

verdict, my question was simply,
why? Why are the Irish so inter-
ested in this American soap
opera? There have been other
O.J. Simpsons in the past, and
there are more O.J. Simpsons

' brooding right now, waiting for

their chances to kill and get
away with it. Sunday
Independent reporter Anne
Harris recently answered my
question: O.J. Simpson holds a
mirror up to Irish society.

And so I stand corrected. The
tale I thought to be inﬂuencing
only Americans is made up of
dreams and dramas. plots and
partialities, anxieties and absur-
dities that belong to the world-
wide viewers who tuned in day
after day to watch the misery
that’s symbolic of the very evil
that’s shaping their lives, wher-

ever their homelands are.
Ireland happens to mirror 0.].
Simpson quite accurately, funny
as it may sound if you regard
only color.

This [Ireland’s] society, like
America, is decaying, leaving
only feeble backdrops of abating
institutions —— educational,
social, political and religious —
that were once revered. This
leaves only abusers, especially
in the religious sector of Irish
society, who can buy their way
out of any criminal case. It
leaves only increasing acts of
random violence resulting from
a rise in drug use and dims the
lights on the children, on the
future.

Three thousand miles away, I
find myself not so far from the
chaotic place I call home

Togetherforever. Or else.

sued Griggs back, claiming
she broke her lease by mov-
ing out. Griggs won, but
Greve still wants money for
the one-year lease she
broke. Now waiting for an
appeal, Griggs is asking for
$5,400.

Now living in a different
apartment, Griggs said that
students put up with so
much because they usually

' don’t have better options.

“Students rent these apart-
ments because they have
to.” She said that they’re
affordable and that most
include utilities, but eventu-
ally you realize how great
the sacrifice really is.
Concerning her old land-
lord Charles J. Greve,
Griggs said, “The only thing
that’ll make him go down is
publicity. There never seems
to be enough people to stand
up for what they believe.”

ries and classrooms for criti-
cal teaching and learning
experiences. How exciting a
business class would be if
the students and their
instructors could “adopt” a
small entrepreneurial effort.
The study of the environ-
ment, including the human
environment, should not be
confined by walls. Better
teaching and scientific and
social-scientific research
will occur when our shiny
new revolving Cathedral
doors bring the community
in and allow our scholars to
go out.

Finally, it is in our nature
as human beings to under-
stand our responsibility to
care about and care for oth-
ers. We have the capability
of seeing that there are those
who have been hampered by
injustices and those who
have profited by society’s
historic biases. We want to
feel as though we are work-
ing in ways that are
ennobling and not demean-
ing. The college community
looks for enlightened leader-
ship and can find it among
its administrators, faculty,
students and community
neighbors.

This year, new University
of Pittsburgh organizations
have begun to strengthen
their efforts to becomea
more visible part of our sur-
rounding community. The
Center for Public and
Community Service has
tapped into the need of
many students to devote
time voluntarily to tutoring
children, comforting lonely
people and restoring build-
ings and recreational areas.

The first—year students
who are part of the FOCUS
Resource Network have
“adopted” second and
fourth-grade children from
the A. Leo Weil School in
the Hill District. The newest
subcommittee of the
Chancellor’s Diversity
Working Group, chaired by
Dr. Barbara Shore, is
addressing the goal of “shar—
ing in the role of leading
advocate for multicultural-
ism that would enhance the
quality of life —— both on
our campus and in the larger
community through
active participation in
alliances with other schools,

'corporations, foundations

and governmental agen-
cies.”

The ancient sage linked
self to others, and the new
ad from Benetton says, “You
can’t get anywhere if you
don’t take someone with
you.”

Preparation for inclusion
in a diverse community
joins scholarship, teaching
and service.

Landlords

°From page I

fell in over Christmas break.
After it was repaired, it fell in
again two months later. To
top it off, his landlord showed
the apartment, without notify-
ing him, to students for next
year and showed up while
Gray was getting out of the
shower. Gray has contacted a
lawyer.

Gray is not the first to com—
plain about Greve and Co.
According to the company’s
complaint file in the universi-
ty’s Commuter Resource
Center, renters have com-
plained about front doors left
unlocked, security buzzers
that don’t function, smoke
detectors without batteries,
hallways with no lights and,
of course. cockroaches. In
addition, there were com—
plaints about dirty water
flooding apartments, lack of
control over heat in apart—
ments, no hot water and man-
agement that takes months to
respond to complaints and
repair damages.

The Commuter Resource
Center, located in the William
Pitt Union, is the campus ser-
vice run by Student Activities
for renters. It offers listings
from real estate companies,
average rents and files on
companies which have com-
plaints against them.

However, the rent list is
three years old and has not
been updated. The average
rents listed range from $336
for an efficiency in Oakland
to about $800 for a house in
Shadyside or Squirrel Hill.
Students often share apart-
ments or houses to save
money, but many pay more
than $500 a month.

When a complaint is filed
through the Commuter
Resource Center, the landlord
is sent a copy and has the
option to respond. But since

it’s voluntary and few stu- V

dents know about the files
anyway, it does little to warn
students about landlords who
have had problems in their
apartments.

Other student renters who
were interviewed agreed that
their living conditions are
often not up to par. Erin
Muldoon, 20, and Amy
Issadore, 21, live in North
Oakland in the Royal
Windsor Apartments, run by
Lobos Management. They
share their two-bedroom
apartment with two others
and pay $690 a month plus
electric. Aside from electrical
problems and a broken front
door, the boiler broke, leav-
ing them without heat during
finals week in December.
“They blame us for things
that go wrong,” said
Muldoon.

Another student, who asked
that her name not be used for
fear that she could lose her
security deposit should her
landlord get word of her pub-
lic complaints, described the
damage in her $440-a-month
(plus utilities) apartment
when she moved in — dam-

age that wasn’t there when

she went to look at the place,
she said. The damage includ-
ed cracked and broken win-
dows, water leaks, foul smells
and pieces of falling ceiling.
The landlord hung up on the
student, and on her mother,
when they called to complain.

Landlords say that apart-
ments are damaged by stu-
dents and that it’s the land-
lords renting in the university
area who have a hard time. In
a letter provided by David
Greve of Greve and Co. to
The Pitt News in response to
inquiries about renter com-
plaints, John P. Kirwin III of
Oakland Real Property
Associates, a property owner
in Oakland, wrote that

code enforcement officers in
Oakland. “They practically
live at privately owned stu-
dent rental properties. The
students know very well how
to use the system to avoid
paying rent by constantly
calling code enforcement
officers to lodge complaints.”

However, Ron Graziano,
assistant chief of Pittsburgh’s
Bureau of Building
Inspection, said that because
of lack of manpower,
Oakland only has two inspec-
tors. Oakland is “too big of
an area for them to do by
themselves.” He said build-
ings are not checked unless
there is a specific complaint
or the owner makes changes

and checking to make sure
everything is up to code.

Graziano said that the
Oakland area has a high level
of complaints and that a big
sweep of student housing has
been planned for this year. It
will be the first since 1988-
89, which took several
months. Along with the
sweep, a pilot program is
planned that would set up
boundaries of trouble areas to
be checked periodically.

People need to complain.
especially students, Graziano
said. He said that most com—
plaints come from parents,
but he would like to see more
students speak up.

or intervene when prob-

to a plan to add a new inspec-
tor whose salary would be
paid by the city and Pitt.
Kirwin said that landlords
have “high credit losses as
students do not pay rent” and
operating expenses that are
“unbelievable” because of
high real estate taxes and util-

ities. He added that “damage 

to the properties by students
is endless.”

Kirwin said in the letter
that there is no shortage of

“Eighty percent of our
inspections are on com-
plaints. We don’t have the
manpower to check apart-
ments on a regular basis. We
can’t enter the building with-
out probable cause.”

And what happens if there
is probable cause? A sweep is
conducted after an area or
apartment building gets too
many complaints. A sweep
involves going into a building

lems occur.

“We don’t want to be a
third party for negotiations,”
said Terry Milani, associate
director of the Office of
Student Activities. “We do
not have a complaint process-
ing mechanism. We do not act
as a mediator between stu-
dents and landlords.” ‘

Milani said that the

Commuter Resource Center-

does not receive a large num-
ber of landlord complaints

and that it is very rare for a
landlord to be removed from
the listings. (Greve and Co. is
there despite many com-
plaints on record.) The num-
ber of rental units of a land-
lord must be taken into
account when looking at
complaints, he said, since
they may reflect a very small
percentage of students who
rent from that landlord.
Students with problems
have recourse to the free legal
service offered by SGB. he

4 said.

Milani said students must
take responsibility for secur-
ing good housing. Renters
who don’t take the time to
search for a good apartment
and settle for substandard
housing are part of the reason-
for the problems in housing.
He likened students who seek
apartments at the last minute
to parkers who don’t give
themselves enough time to
get a space in Oakland.

“As a result of decisions
students make, those proper-
ties don‘t meet their needs.”

Milani said that, as of May
1, the CRC will no longer be
part of Student Activities;
off-campus housing issues
will be taken care of by the
university’s Property
Management division.

“I don’t think there will be
a decrease in service,” said
Associate Vice Chancellor for
Business John DeVitto. The
move will provide a “central
place for one-stop shopping”
for housing services, he said.
“Our foremost goal is to
serve the students.”

Opinions
Cut it all off, Texas

You commit a crime. You are sentenced to eight years in
prison. You serve six and are eligible for “mandatory release.”
You admit to the authorities that if you are released you will
commit the same crime again. What happens?

You are released anyway.

Larry Don McQuay was arrested in Texas and convicted of
child molestation. He admits that he committed the crime over
240 times and that he will not be physically able to stop him-
self from doing it again if he is released. McQuay, the self-
professed Child-Molesting Demon, has even promised that his
next victims will be killed.

And to add one more bizarre twist to this story, McQuay has
asked that he be castrated to prevent this from happening

’ again.

Exactly what is the point of issuing an eight-year sentence if
a criminal will have to be released in three-fourths of that
time? Since when does a criminal, especially a child-molester,
earn the automatic right to parole just because a portion of
his/her sentence has been served? Shall we assume that if
Charles Manson or Ted Bundy had lived in Texas that they
might be the next ones paroled?

Even though he is technically on parole, McQuay will spend
the next two years (at tax payers’ expense) in a locked cell. He
will be under 24-hour surveillance, will wear an electronic
homing device on his ankle and cannot leave the facility in
which he is living without a chaperone. What, then, is the dif-
ference between this and prison? The difference is that
McQuay will have four parole officers assigned to his case,
and that he will be staying in the San Antonio Parole Violator
Facility instead of the psychiatric prison in East Texas.

First of all, McQuay should never have been paroled.
“Mandatory release” is a pointless attempt to reform prisoners
and, especially in this case, has failed miserably. McQuay has
asked to be castrated, since he knows he has not been rehabili-
tated.

Unfortunately, no judge in his or» her right mind would ever
allow McQuay to be castrated. Civil rights organizations
would leap on that decision as a violation of protection from
cruel and unusual punishment. Perhaps castration is cruel; it is
certainly unusual. But, especially when McQuay has requested
it, castration might be the only appropriate action, though even
this cannot guarantee his reform.

Child molesters commit some of the most disgusting crimes
in the law books. There is a serious question of whether or not
they should ever be released from prison, and parole shouldn’t
even be in question. Even other prisoners detest child moles-
ters, which is why so many of them are kept out of general
prison populations. Exposure to a general prison population
might be a better alternative, though, so that people like
McQuay would not have the opportunity to kill their next vic-
tims.

Voicing their opinions...

Dedication,
not diversity

This is in response to the
March 14 article,
“Encouraging the right kind
of diversity,” by Joseph
Mcdowell, “and especially
importantly,” is dedicated

to the people who wasted.

their time reading the guest
columnist’s whining. What
is the criteria for being
crowned guest columnist
for The Pitt News? Proof
reading certainly isn’t a fac-
tor. Can anyone tell me
what “especially important-
ly” means? Far be it from
me to be critical, with my
own countless flaws. But
the author of this column
teaches general writing here
at Pitt. Not only does he
need to check his own writ-
ing, but he also needs a
good spanking.

What I must take to task
is that this article, with its
special Diversity at Pitt
logo, had nothing at all to
do with the issue of diversi-
ty at Pitt. It was simply a
rationalizing diatribe from
someone who flunked out of
school and who blames
everyone except the one
who is responsible, him.
Was this article edited by
The Pitt News staff? Was it
even read? Or does a guest
columnist garner special
privileges? Mr. Mcdowell
spent over half of those six
columns telling the reader
what Webster’s definition
of diversity is, while build-
ing his own straw house of
an argument as to why the
university suspended him.
Well, the big bad wolf is
here to tell Mr. Mcdowell,
how dare he use an impor-
tant issue like diversity, and
six columns of The Pitt

News print, to whine. It
wasn’t your “diversity” (as
you stated so painfully to
my ears, mind and heart)
that caused your failure as a
student at Pitt, Mr. Teacher.
It was your inability to take
responsibility for your own
shortcomings.

Furthermore, you make a
sweepingly general, seri-
ously condescending and
unwarranted reproachful
criticism of any and all of
your former classmates. Mr.
Mcdowell states that
because “my experiences as
an underprivileged black
male usually differed from
those of my classmates, my
voice and my words were
hardly ever heard.” Then he
somehow sticks a second
foot in his mouth continu-
ing, “I think that people
heard what I was saying,
but because my words were
diverse (experiences differ-
ent than most the people in
the class, including my
teacher), my words drifted
in the air and, frozen by the
silence of the room, they
crashed to the floor.” Blah,
blah, blah. Do you realize
that throughout this article
you somehow sound like a
little boy who got his lol-
lipop taken away, while at
the same time quoting from
a book of cliches and
mumbo-jumbo. Did it ever
occur to you that possibly
your words simply had no
merit. You flunked out of
school, man. My guess is
you didn’t know what you
were talking about.

And here’s a little tidbit
about me, Mr. Guest
Columnist. Guess what, two
years after you were “sus-
pended from the universi-
ty,” (in other words, flunked
out) I screwed up big time

too. The only difference is
that I quit right before I
flunked out. In my instance
I could have called my arti-
cle Encouraging the right
kind of Poverty, or any
other problematic baggage,
via a university mouth-
piece.” Please focus on con-
structive criticism and pos-
sible solutions, and save the
personal agenda for the cry
room. And editors, read this
crap before you print it. Oh
yeah. Pitt. Yeah, you. Who
hired this dude to teach?
David Jansen is a student
who is sick and tired of
whiners and unqualified
teachers.

Affirmative
action in

Having recently returned
from the United States
Student Association legisla-
tive conference, I would
like to stress the importance
of affirmative action to
everyone. Much negative
press has surrounded this
issue lately and I feel the
true benefits of affirmative
action have not been
exposed. The recent
Pennsylvania House of
Representatives vote, 99-
97, to eliminate affirmative
action in state hiring and
contracting is ludicrous.
Does repealing 30 years of
promoting women and peo-
ple of color into the work-
place really enrich society?
I think not.

This is in no way an
attack on the “common
white male;” it is a gateway
of opportunity for those
persons in society that have
not had the chance to
advance previously. It is
quite evident that racism

°Letters, page 9

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 10, 1996

Letters

°frompage8

and sexism are still quite
prevalent. How many pro-
fessors do you have that are
women? People of color?
Statistics show that only 36
percent of all Ph.D. holders
are women, and less than 10
percent are people of color.
This is NOT because women
and “minorities” are not
qualified. Traditions dating
back to slavery and limited
rights of both women and
[minorities] have kept us in
a secondary role. Thirty
years ago, this legislation
was introduced nationally to
give a push to enter and sur-
vive in the work force and
education. , I

Affirmative action works
as a cycle. By implementing
it in admissions for college,
all students benefit. The

-experiences of women and

people of color are much
different than many other
people’s, and they contribute
to a more well-rounded
classroom discussion. Also,
out of class much is learned.
Women and people of color
offer positive influences,
and relationships formed can
be some of the most reward-
ing aspects of your college
career. For whatever reason,
many women and people of
color have had difficulty

finding their way to the uni-

versities of America. Only
recently have we really
begun to integrate.

Once students do progress
and graduate, affirmative
action can play a major role.
Bias still exists in America,
and affirmative action pro-
vides qualified women and
minorities with access to
jobs. When they advance
into these jobs, they become
role models to others and
show that women and
minorities can survive and
compete in our capitalistic
society. In return, more stu-
dents of color and women
will compete to do better in
school and strive to obtain
high—paying jobs.

I, however, do not believe
that affirmative action will
be necessary forever. Once
there is a balance of persons
in society of men, women
and people of color, the
action will no longer be nec-
essary. Yet, it is quite evi-
dent that the ratio of women
in the work force is unjustly
uneven. Affirmative action
must be saved! It is in no
way putting totally unquali-
fied people in top positions.
It offers a chance for compe-
tent people to survive, to get
out of poverty. If an unwrit-
ten quota system does exist,

it should be erased; maybe
reform of some sort is nec-
essary. But abolishing it is
unthinkable. Affirmative
action is not about numbers;
it is about people’s lives.

The easiest

Columnist
Mike
Kovak

hings are always
made easier for
today’s youth.

When simple plant main-
tenance got too tough, some
genius invented the Chia
Pet. When people got too
lazy to get off the couch,
the remote control became
a facet of everyday life.

Book and newspapers can
now be read on the Internet
(although, personally, I pre-
fer looking at the pictures),
and there’s that damn glow-
ing puck flying around on
Fox’s NHL broadcasts so
that fanspcan follow the
game easier.

Everything is user-friend-
ly these days.

People often come up to
me and ask, “Hey Kovak,
how do you always come
up with ideas for your
columns?”

I reply back, “Aw shucks,
it ain’t all that hard. All’s
ya gotta do is think and
type. Who cares how the
final product comes out?
You'll learn that most peo-
ple think you suck anyway.
So you just do what you
want.”

Well, not being one to
make things difficult for
others, it’s time to make
things easier for all of you
who desire to write a sports
column (that should narrow
it down to the three of
you).

Rule #1: Take a current
sports event.

lt’s fairly obvious that
I’m in direct violation of
this rule, but that’s OK,

, because nothing worth

mentioning is going on
right now.

.Rule #2: Form an opin-
ion about the current
sports event.

You know the saying:

’ “Opinions are like
@#%holes, everybody’s got
one.” Forming opinions is
easy. Here are a few opin-
ions. in case you’re con-
fused: Byron “Bam” Morris

It’s too bad for local trophy
and plaque makers that Pitt
track and field star Najuma
Fletcher is graduating this
year._

When she leaves Pitt for
good later this month, the ath-
letic department will be hard
pressed to find someone who
wins as many awards and
keeps the trophy makers in
business.

The l4—time All-American
did it again last night at the
annual Senior Awards Dinner
in the ballroom of the William
Pitt Union. She took home the
female Panther Award, given
to the athlete “who best pro-
motes Pitt athletics through
outstanding athletic achieve-
ment.”

Fletcher’s four-year term at
Pitt has been filled with
awards. Among her accolades
this year, she snagged the
national championship in the
indoor high jump, was All-
American for high and triple
jump, won the 1996 Big East
Most Outstanding Field
Performer and was the 1996
USCTA Female Indoor Track
Division I Athlete of the Year.

Fletcher led the way for the
senior class last night, one that
both Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes and Assistant Athletic
Director Carol Sprague said
they will miss greatly.

The male‘ Panther Award
went to two different athletes

StEllL1.lS,.

Co—Panther Award winner
Tumulty was the heart of the
Panther football defense. The
middle linebacker from Penn
Hills High School finished his
Pitt career with 413 tackles,
the third highest Pitt total.

Tumulty’s teammate, wide-
out Dietrich Jells, was one of
five seniors to receive the
Senior of Distinction award.
This was the first year of the
award, and joining Jells were
basketball point guard Jerry
McCullough, diver Sunday
Lewandoski, women’s volley-
ball outside/middle hitter
Sarah Mikla and tennis player
Kristen Siegel.

The list of year-end winners
continued with the Blue-Gold
winners, given to the athletes
who best “represent the stu-
dent-athlete ideal, based on
academic scholarship, athletic
achievement, leadership quali-
ties and citizenship.”

The male Blue-Gold winner
was swimmer Chris Perry, a
Big East finalist in the 200
breaststroke and a four-time
Bell Atlantic Scholar-Athlete.

Pitt’s cycling team finished second,
with 296 points, but miles behind
Penn State, 732, at the Riverview
Criterium, which hosted both colle-
giate and United States Cycling
Federation races last Saturday.

In the collegiate races, the Panthers
beat racers from Lockhaven,
Bloomsburg and ‘California
University of Pennsylvania.

“We start off by going downhill
with twisting turns,” said Pitt junior
Wai Hung Fong. “Then you go back
up, four-percentgrade. It’s not too
bad compared to Sycamore Street,
which is a 20-percent grade.”

In the Collegiate Men’s A race,
which consisted of 14 laps around a
1.7-mile course, junior Tim Lyons
finished third with 1:21:31, and
senior Jeff Timinski placed fourth
with a time of 1:21:36.

“We knew it would be between us
and Penn State,” said Timinski.

In the second lap, Penn State start-
ed sending cyclists from the front of
its pack on the attack. Pitt, with five
cyclists in its pack, was able to cover
the Lions for the next few laps.

The eventual winner, Penn State’s
Pat Flannery, broke on the third of
14 laps. Lyons also broke and started
to chase him him up the hill.

“At that point, the race shut down
for the next two laps,” said Timinski,

place leader from Penn State,
Michael Hertner.

Racers often eat “glue,’ a glucose
solution during the race. When
Timinski ate, he did not get the
expected burst of energy.

“I just cramped up, and Hertner
noticed, so he pushed ahead,” said
Timinski.

This left Hertner with no cover, so
the Penn State cyclist moved in on
Lyons.

“I was concerned, because Tim

[covering him]. He was stuck in a
two and one,” said Timinski. “I was
just trying to haul ass to catch up.”

Timinski was able to pick up the
pace with two laps and place himself
in an offensive position that enabled
Lyons to finish third.

Fong was on the eighth lap of the
race when his wheel locked with
another racer. He finished 13th in
1:25:04.

“We were in a pack, and I got
knocked over,” said Fong, who sport-
ed a series of bruises from the fall.
The back of his calf showed a two-
inch-wide mark from where another
racer had run over his leg.

“The rubber going across my skin
burned it,” Fong said. “It’s part of
racing.”

"Backyard Braw|"

takes a different
twist today

_. ?Cy€'i:',8;_g,2age.11  . 

B.y Brad Isles
Sports Editor

The baseball version of the “Backyard
Brawl” between Pitt and West Virginia
will have a new twist in today’s double-
header at Hawley Field in Morgantown.

Though the teams have played on a
yearly basis, this is the first time the two
will battle in Big East competition. The
Mountaineers are in their first year in the
Big East after switching over from the
Atlantic 10. To make today’s games more
intriguing, Pitt and WVU are in the same
division (American).

“Before when we played them, we used
them to get ready for the Big East,” Pitt
pitcher Kevin Kramer said. “It will be fun
playing them now that the stakes are
raised.”

Though the Mountaineers struggled last
year, finishing with an overall record of
18-32 in Head Coach Greg Van Zant’s
first year, they have turned things com-
pletely around this year. West Virginia is
16-13 overall and currently leads the
American Division at 8-2 in league
games, two games ahead of second-place
St. John’s (5-3).

Pitt (17-12-2), on the_other hand, is bat-
tling for a playoff berth. It is 3-6 in league

a final cumulative grade—point.

year med student Hallie
Brooks finished fifth, tying
the third—place finisher’s
time of 1:12:26. The racing
became more difficult as the
day progressed. Vu still
managed to finish second
with 23:51, just barely
behind the first-place fin-
isher from Penn State in the
USCF Category 5 race,
which was four laps, or 10
miles.

In the Category 4 race,
which was 10 laps, or 24
miles, Timinski heldout for
first place with a time
0:56:30. He wasn’t sup-
posed to win.

The team strategy slated
Neil Grant to win. He
hadn’t competed in the col-
legiate races, and the team
expected him to be fresh for
the second-to-last race.

“We were working to set
him up for the win,” said
Timinski. Grant eventually
finished sixth.

“The teamwork worked
really well,” said Timinski.
“He [Grant] broke away on
the fifth lap. He had a half-
minute lead we were trying
to block — to shut down the
other team’s chase.”

Grant went for the break
at the first opportunity, only
a few laps into the race, and
peaked too early.

“You can have a strategy,
but you never know what’s
going to happen,” said
Timinski. “There were a
few teams that had a small
break, but we reeled them
back in.”

With Grant falling behind,
Timinski was able to locate
another cyclist to pass and
pushed for the sprint at the
end.

The final race, the elite
level Category 1/2/3 race
ended in snow.

Josh Smith won with a
time of 1:02:38. Smith, who
finished second at Junior
Nationals a few years ago,
dropped out of Pitt last year
after his freshman year to
pursue racing full time.

games and sits in fifth place in the
American Division, 4-1/2 games behind
the Mountaineers. But Pitt isn’t paying
attention to where it currently sits.

“We all decided we’re not going to
worry about the standings until we get
back to .500 in the Big East,” Kramer
said. “We’ve been playing better in the
conference, and we're going down
there with a lot of confidence.”

The Mountaineers are rolling, sweep-
ing Seton Hall last Thursday, 4-2 and
6-5, and then splitting a doubleheader
with Rutgers, falling 4-1 in the first
game and winning the second, 3-2.

Sophomore righty Chris Enochs was
named Co-Big East Pitcher of the
Week, getting a complete game in the
Mountaineers’ win in the second
Rutgers game. He allowed two runs on
six hits, while striking out five and
walking two. He is 2-3 with a 6.44
earned—run average.

Though WVU returns seven of nine
pitchers from last year’s staff, not one
has an ERA under 4.05 (Rodney
Allen). ~

Lefthander Mike Riley led the team
last year with a 6-5 record and 56
strikeouts but is 3-2 in seven starts this
year and has an ERA of 4.96. He’s
struck out 41 and walked 28, and oppo-
nents are batting .300 against him.

Pitt, on the other hand, is second in
the Big East, with a team ERA of 3.65.
Panther pitchers have combined for 200
strikeouts, which leads the conference,
and have a league-best 10 saves.

All year, Pitching Coach Joe Hill has
used a committee-style approach to his
staff, with 11 of 12 pitchers garnering
at least one win. Using so many pitch-
ers keeps the staff fresh throughout the
season and has other advantages, name-
ly that the batters can’t get comfortable
knowing they might see a different
pitcher each time they bat.

“It gives the batters something new to
look at,” Kramer said.

Lefty Mike Rohrbach is 3-2 with two

saves in 14 appearances. He’s tied with
closer Jason Rakaczewski in ERA, each
at 3.02. Rakaczewski is 2-2 and leads
the team in strikeouts (43) and the Big
East in saves with six in 15 appear-

As good as Pitt’s pitching is, it’s
fielding is just as bad. The Panthers are
last in the Big East with a .939 fielding
percentage and have committed 70
errors on the year.

The Panthers’ bats are struggling as
well, their .268 combined average
putting Pitt ninth in the conference.

Freshman infielder Lou Melucci
leads the team with a .301 average, and
outfielder Kurt Womelsdorf is second
with a .297 average.

For West Virginia, senior shortstop
Tony Meyers, who led WVU last year
in batting .372, home runs (12) and
RBI (46), is off to a slow start this year.
He’s only batting .229, going 22~for-96
in 29 games.

Abe Barker, a sophomore
outfielder/first baseman has the top
average for regular starters, batting
.358 (34 for 95) in 28 games. He also
leads the team in RBI, with 16, and
strikeouts, 22.

Pitt hosts West Virginia next
Wednesday with a double header to be

that day, why didn’t he look

for the phone numbers list-

ed in the paper? I dunno —
that’s why he’s stupid.

This is the most important
rule to remember when
writing a sports column.
Part of the deal is to anger
people. The rest of the peo-
ple should be laughing or
agreeing. This is the key to
a successful sports column.

Rule #5: Never buckle in
to anybody, and let your
feelings flow freely.

One of the easiest things
for anybody to do is to com-
plain. If you can complain
to a person, you can com-
plain in a column. Listen to
these complaints; then
decide just how easy it can
be.

I despise Villanova
University. It’s a bunch of
sassy, fancy—lads running
around playing bridge and
thinking they’re the great-
est. Kerry Kittles did not
deserve to be named first-
team All-American and if
Head Coach Steve “Ratboy”
Lappas had not decided to ‘ 1'
leave the 6-foot-6, 98-
pound rum in games when
leading by 40 points, he
wouldn’t have been.

It is not always necessary
to complain about other
schools. There are several
things that are easy to com-
plain about at this school as
well. The disappointing sea-
sons of the football and bas-
ketball teams come to mind.
So does the fact that the
beloved Pitt—Penn State
rivalry will cease to exist by
the year 2001.

Complaining comes natu-
rally to anybody. Just write
it down.

Rule #6: Be prepared to
defend yourself.

‘Athletes will approach
you looking for confronta-
tions. When someone a foot
taller and 150 pounds heav-
ier is ticked off, the best
defense is a quick wit and a
stiletto. They have a right to
be mad, but you have the
right to write about poor
performances — hey, it’s
the, news.

Once you’ve started,
you’ll eventually formulate
some rules of your own. It
all comes with experience,
like everything else. So
while you’re at home, and
certain to be practicing your
sports column skills, follow
these rules and you’ll have
hours of unbridled joy at the
expense of the misery of
others.
