resident

Cherise Clement received a
$275 housing refund from Pitt
because the University crammed
two extra people into her Sutherland
suite. She used the money to help
pay for her textbooks and a comput-
er.

But, nearly a month later, the
University sent her a bill asking for
$250 of the refund back.

Her suitemate Kate Hodorowicz
and a few other students who
allegedly owe money to Pitt can
relate to Clement’s predicament.
They also have received refund
checks for their housing and have
been asked by Pitt to. return part of
the money.

But the students say they are
going to fight to keep it. Clement
and Hodorowicz said they should
not have to pay the money back
because they called the University
after receiving their checks and were
told that the money was theirs.

" [Pitt] should have been sure
how much we were supposed to get
before they sent the money out,
instead of hastily sending too much
out, and then asking for it back,"

Clement said.

Both Hodorowicz and Clement
were originally charged $1,709 for a
two-person room. But when it
appeared that a third person might
move into their rooms, Pitt sent
them each a refund because a three-
person room is only $1,400 per per-
son.

According to Pitt spokesman
Ken Service, the initial $1,709 bill
was correct because their rooms
remained doubles.

Clement said that in her numer-
ous calls to the University between
mid—July and late August, she was
told that a third person was not mov-
ing into her room.

Clement and Hodorowicz have
both accrued $25 late fees since
receiving their bills because they
refuse to give the money back. Both
women said they are being punished
for Pitt's mistake.

"Pitt has this record freshman
class, and I'm happy for them,"
Clement said. "I don't want to seem
like I'm not supportive of my school,
but I don't want them to act like [the
situation] is my fault."

WASHINGTON —— They kneeled in the packed mud and grass
between the Capitol building and the Washington Monument,
repenting their personal failures with tears and emotional cries and
vowing to adhere to the ideals of Christianity.

They were men with a mission —— to strengthen their families
and advance racial and religious unity, while their wives and chil-
dren watched in their living rooms across the country.

This weekend an estimated more than 1 million men attend-
ed "Stand in the Gap: A Sacred Assembly of Men," an event spon-
sored by the Promise Keepers. Organization ofﬁcials declined to
give an oﬂicial estimate because of the controversy surrounding
the discrepancies in the estimated attendance at the Mil1ion—Man

men "on their knees in humility and on their
feet in unity" through a one-day period of
Christian-based "revival and spiritual awak-
ening," according to the event's mission
statement.

Promise Keepers, a national Christ-
centered ministry movement, has gained
recognition for its weekend-long revivals in
cities around the country. Promise Keepers‘
events have been characterized by stories of
men escaping addictions and abusive life-
styles after weekends of emotionally
charged and physically exhausting gather-
mgs.

The event began at 11:45 am. with the
hymn "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and
continued until 6 p.m.

"We want to confess our personal fail-
ures, neglecting of our families, being sec-
tarian in the church and racial insensitivity,"
said Jack Hayford, one of the handful of
speakers.

Statements about the importance of
being humble continually sounded through-
out the Mall.

"Allow the Holy Spirit to X-ray our
lives," said one of the speakers.

Randy Harrison, a minister at the New
Hope Christian Community on North
Dithridge Street, compared "Stand in the
Gap" to a Biblical narrative.

"When we see more than 2 million men
assembled, think about the task Moses had
in leading the Israelites out of Egypt,"
Harrison said.

Other members of the University com-
munity said the event was the ﬁrst step in
the right direction for American society.

"We ask men to come together and
pray. It is not a political statement. It is to
acknowledge we as Christians need God to
help this country," said Tjendirnin

ol"VI"fl‘,"I

Tjandrawan, a graduate student studying
neuropathology at the University of
Pittsburgh.

But not everyone gathered at the event
was supportive of its premise. As men were
worshipping, and confessing their sins, the
National Organization of Women held a
protest march on a nearby sidewalk.

They canied slogans saying, "Fight
sexism and racism," and "I am capable of
taking care of myself."

There was an intense dialogue between
one of the men from "Stand in ﬂie Gap" and
one of the women ﬁom NOW.

"You may be having trouble with the
statement in the Bible, ‘women be subrr1is—
sive to your husbands,‘ but you are forget-
ting that men are to be submissive to the
Lord and treat their wives as they would
treat the lord," commented the man.

He kneeled in front of her, begged her
to see that the Promise Keepers are not
seeking a subordinate status for women and
asked her if he could pray for her.

"Why did not God take a rib from the
women and create man?" replied the
woman. "I don't want you to pray for me."

She turned to another woman, talked
for a moment and left. The man did not have
a reply for her question, but prayed for the
women out loud as they walked away.

As the event was about to conclude,
Bill , the founder and CEO of the Promise
Keepers, exhorted the men with statements
of unity.

"A house divided cannot stand. Now
we are united. Unity with diversity and
diversity without dissension," McCartney
said. "Everyone needs to do their part. Set
your mind on things above. We have to be
hungry for more."

in the uncomfortable situation of having
to put a positive spin on Pitt’s housing
problem to prospective students and
their parents. She said she dislikes hav-
ing to defend the overcrowded—housing
situation while having her own out-
standing balance. 0

According to Clement, a woman
called her in mid-July claiming to be a
new roommate and said that the six-per-
son suite was going to become a nine-
person suite.

When Clement called the housing
ofﬁce to conﬁrm this, the woman she
talked to said that nothing had been

decided yet but to call back the next ‘

day.

She was later told that the ' suite's
double bedrooms would either be con-
verted into triples or that the suite
would have three students bunk in the
living room. _

According to Clement, the housing-
ofﬁce employee later told her that the
additional people would in fact be
bunking in the suite's living room.

When Clement and Hodorowicz
each received a refund check for $275,
no explanation accompanied it.

‘ Clement called Pitt's accounts-
receivable office and the phone-
inquiries numbers listed on the check
stub, but no one answered at either
number.

Finally, she called the student-
accounts department, -which told her the
refund was an adjustment for the

   

FROM PAGE 1

change in her housing situation.
Clement placed a final call to the hous-
ing ofﬁce to be sure that the check was
correct and that she could cash it.

"They told me it was okay and to go
ahead and cash it, so I cashed it and
used it to help buy books and a comput-
er," Clement noted.

Less than a month later, Clement
and Hodorowicz each received from
Pitt a bill in the mail _for $250. Clement
said the housing ofﬁce told her it had
made a mistake, had refunded too much
money, and now wanted some of it
back.

When Clement returned to campus
this fall, she visited the housing ofﬁce
and asked to speak with Director of
Housing Harry Burner. The receptionist
took Clement's telephone number and
said Burner would be in touch with her.

Clement says she waited a week for
Burner to call before calling him again.
When '- she did not get a response, she
then called the Office of the Vice

Chancellor for Student Affairs, which

was unable to resolve this issue.

At this point, Hodorowicz and
Clement are not sure what to do. They
said they are simply looking for
answers and are looking for help.

Hodorowicz and Clement did not
cash their checks until being assured by
the University that their refunds were
correct. Despite their late fees‘ accrual,
Hodorowicz and Clement say they do
not plan to repay the money.

Internet runaway is back home

Across the Nation

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. —— A 12-year-
old California boy who ran away from
home to visit a friend he met on the
Internet is back with his parents as of
Sunday. ’

Brian Poulsen’s parents ﬂew out to
Virginia for yesterday’s reunion after a
month of searching. Brian was found
Friday at the home of a 31-year old man in
Fairfax, Va., who said he met the boy on
the Intemet.

The man said he sent the boy a bus
ticket after the boy said he was having
trouble at home. The man told police he
put the boy on a return bus Sept. 22.

Authorities say the boy was intrigued
with Intemet chat rooms and tried to run
away once before. His destination then
was a 15-year-old who had sent him
money after an Internet meeting.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — The father of
10-year-old Jeffrey Curley says he wants
the death penalty for his son’s killers.

Divers in New England are back in the
water today searching for the
Massachusetts boy’s body.

Authorities say Curley was kidnapped
Wednesday near his home by two men

who lured him into their car, possibly with A

the promise of a bike. ,

Police believe the boy’s body was sex-
ually molested before being stuifed into a
cement-ﬁlled container and thrown into a
river. Two suspects are in custody.

New Hampshire state police say ofﬁ-
cials are concentrating on a location in
nearby Kittery, Maine, based on informa-
tion from one of the suspects.

In the meantime, Robert Curley says
it’s okay if the case is turned over to feder-
al authorities. The death penalty becomes a
possibility with a federal conviction.

Mail—order companies are offering
porcelain plates and medals with Diana’s
likeness, and a set of stamps will be issued
later this year.

As Christa Douaihy strolls
through the William Pitt Union wear-
ing her tie-dyed bandana, corduroy
pants and a T—shirt, she talks to
almost everyone she sees and looks
nothing like a student government
official.

Less than a year ago, this self-
proclaimed radical outsider to stu-
dent government, who works toward
non-traditional goals, such as sexual
assault prevention and involving
multicultural groups in campus activ-
ities, pushed through
the Greek control, win-
ning a seat on the SGB
and wanting to "shake
things up."

Despite these
goals, which she pro-
fessed last fall
throughout her cam-
paign, Douaihy has
become an insider
since her affiliation
with student govern-
ment. 0

As a result, she
repeatedly backed up her organiza-
tion in the eye of a controversy this
semester concerning questionable
expenditures of $11,000 used over
the summer by SGB President Justin
DalMolin and other board members.

At a student government board
meeting two weeks ago, when a stu-
dent suggested DalMolin and some
other student government members
resign, Douaihy said,"Justin is com-
pletely competent. Screw them all."

Even Douaihy admits her past
radicalism stemmed from dealing
with members of SGB, who focused
on ideas such as Pitt pride and Greek
academia, which did not allow much
of a role for progressive groups such
as the Campus a Women's
Organization that Douaihy actively
participated in.

But, while she has mellowed
politically, she has not brushed aside
her determination for social service,

Christa Douaihy takes notes at last week's SGB meeting.

to be an agent of change, and most
important, to be loyal to the things
and people she believes in.

"When I was a freshman and
sophomore, I felt the SGB was an
enemy," said Douaihy. "I wanted to
instill positive aspects of hierarchy to
student government, The SGB are
not a bunch of elitists."

Douaihy said she lives by a quote
from Nelson Mandela, "If you let
your lights shine, it will brighten oth-
ers," because "people are afraid of
themselves and the power they have"
and need to let their lights shine.

This 20-year-old junior political
science major grew up
in Scranton, Pa., which
is in the northeast por-
tion of the state.
Douaihy is also work-
ing toward a certificate
in women's studies. ‘ L

"Politics is tradition-
ally male dominated,"
said Douaihy. "For so
long women felt out of
place and touch with
politics. Women should
be more involved in
political issues."

Douaihy's love of politics began
in high school, where she joined the
debate team.

Her debate partner was her twin
sister, Margot Douaihy, who also
attends Pitt.

These two sisters may be identi-
cal in appearance, but they have very
different interests. Christa is‘ very
focused on politics, while Margot
enjoys liberal arts, poetry and writ-
ing.
Their different interests did not
get between them, though, according
to Christa Douaihy.

"My twin sister and I are best
friends," said Douaihy. "Growing up
with her was awesome. We never
fought." ‘

Douaihy also said she gets much
of her inspiration from the activism
of Martin Luther King, Jr.

‘'1 was so empowered by his

words,“ said Douaihy. "He did not
hate anybody."

As a result of the interests she
formed in high school in politics,
diversity and social justice, she
decided to enroll in the large and
diverse University of Pittsburgh
beginning in the fall semester of
1995.

Upon entering Pitt, Douaihy
quickly became involved with orga-
nizations such as the Campus
Women's Organization and Sexual
Assault Services.

Her first official work-study job
as a new college student was as a
clerical aide at Sexual Assault
Services.

It was no mistake at all that she
landed herself in this particular
office, as opposed to other work-
study positions.

"I knew this was the place I want-
ed to be," said Douaihy. "I saw the
impact it had on people by giving
them knowledge to stand up for
themselves."

Her experience at Sexual Assault
Services led her to become a Peer
Educator for SAS.

After a 40-hour week of training,
Douaihy actively pursued her goal to
help herself and others become more
aware of sexual assault and its pre-
vention.

"This job [at SAS] got me inter-
ested in student government," said

Douaihy. "I wanted to make this part
of the agenda for SGB. It's not out of
their realm."

When DalMolin appointed her
liaison to the Inter—Fraternity Council
in January, Douaihy got her chance to
implement sexual assault awareness
within the Greek system.

Although Douaihy is not a liaison
to the Panhellenic Association, she
also works with Panhel.

Lea Shafer, Panhel's president,
set up sexual assault awareness pro-
grams with Douaihy and is planning
sexual assault awareness programs
for Greek 101, which is an event
where new Greek membersbecome
oriented with the Greek system. She
said she would like Douaihy to speak

about these issues at
Greek l0l.

"Christa came to
my sorority and spoke
about sexual assault,"
said Shafer. "All my
sorority sisters loved
her. They liked her

great concern for
women's issues."
Douaihy has

helped Shafer in other
areas besides Panhel.

When Shafer could
not get in touch with
the allocations liaison
last semester, Douaihy sat down with
her and answered Shafer's questions.

After her term in SGB is over,
Douaihy plans to study abroad.

Pitt housing must
answer for its mistake

Pitt’s housing ﬁasco has reached the level of absolute
ludicrousness. You’d think that doing simple arithmetic like
subtraction wouldn’t pose such a problem for an institution
of higher learning. But you’d be wrong.

Students have been packed into the dorms for the sole
purpose of making more money for Pitt through increasing
enrollment. The housing -admission deadline was extend-
ed by a month so that more students would get in, and when
they got in, Pitt stuffed them into closets and living rooms.

Then Pitt overcharged them for the costs of the donn
rooms. In what looked like a correction, Pitt issued reﬁmds
— refunds of varying and incorrect amotmts. After realiz-
ing its mistake, Pitt ordered students to give back money
that some had already spent on things like books.

Now, students who haven’t returned their refunds yet
have been charged late fees that they couldn’t anticipate
(and that aren’t their fault).

The whole story looks like a comedy of errors, except
that it’s supremely insulting to every student who has been
affected by the ﬁasco. And the people in charge, who have
screwed so many students over, aren’t talking to students
and aren’t returning their calls.

Here’s the only responsible, intelligent and acceptable
course of action Pitt can take: '

Recalculate every student’s account. Credit every stu-

dent for what he paid for his dorm room. Issue new invoic-
es for the new cost of the sardine-can like housing the stu—
dents will be living in for the next several months. And for-
get every late charge that has been incurred since the circus
began. Forget the fees — not forgive —— because it’s the
University’s fault, not the students’.

Pitt must answer to every student as to how and why
these errors were made before demanding a single cent
back from anybody.

The University is going to be making a lot of money on
st11dentsthisyear:'Iheleastitcandoistreatst11dentslike
any good business treats its customers: with a bit of respect
and courtesy. These qualities seem to be extended to
wealthy alurrmi. Pitt should extend them to the students
who are paying good money and getting jerked around.

And Harry Bumer, the director of housing, can startby

personally returning the calls of every justiﬁably angry stu— »

dent here.

As many readers of my columns

can probably guess, I’m not really

much of a fan of radio talk—show host
Rush Limbaugh. Obvious ideologi-
cal differences aside, I think he’s a
loud, obnoxious and rather unintelli-
gent individual. But there is another
more important reason why I dislike
Rush. ’ V ,

Rush does little but conﬁrm the
prejudices his listeners have of the
ways of the world. For Limbaugh
fans, listening to his show is an ego
boost and a critical—thought killer. I
prefer to be challenged by someone
whowilldaretotellmethatmy
assumptions could be wrong or
encouraged to examine an issue
from a different or unique perspec-
tive. Unfortunately, if you’re looking
for intellectual stimulation or critical
thought, look elsewhere.

Take, for example, this typically
mindless attempt to panderto his fol-
lowers’ dislike of government pro-
grarnsthatRushrnadeinoneofhis
books: “VVrth the exception of the
 I defy you to name one gov-
ermnent program that has worked
and alleviated the problem it was cre-
ated to solve. Hhhhrnrnrnrmn? rm
waiting  T1me’s up.” Amazingly
enough, this is a statement that more
than a few conservatives would take
issue with.

Conservative columnist George
F. Will was asked this question and
responded that programs like the
rural-electrification program and the
interstate-highway system, which he
called “the most successful public
works program in the history of the
world,” were pretty great federal pro-
grams. Conservative columnist Ben
Stein cited Social Security,

Medicare, Head Start, food stamps
and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation as great federal-govem—
ment programs. Sounds like Rush is
a little out of touch with his own fel-
low conservatives.

But Rush goes on to make some
other bizarre statements that require
rather twisted logic to accept. For
instance, Rush has said: “Don’t let
liberals deceive you into believing
that a decade of sustained growth
without inﬂation in America [the
1980s] resulted in a bigger gap
between the haves and have—nots.
Figures compiled ’ by the
Congressional Budget Oﬂice dispel
that myth.” Too bad for Rush they
don’t. According to the CBO, the
wealthiest ﬁfth of Americans had
eight times the wealth of the poorest
Americans in 1980, but by 1989
those same wealthy Americans had
20 times the wealth of those sarrre
poor.
Onanother occasion Rushmade
the claim: “It lets not been proven
that nicotine is addictive, and the
same with cigarettes causing emphy-
sema.” What? Other than a few
tobacco farmers in North Carolina,
Rush is pretty much the sole person
alive who still thinks that tobacco
isn’t harmful to one’s health. What
next? “Asbestos. Our Misrmderstood
Friend?”

Limbaugh enjoys employing

certain tricks to deceive his listeners. _

A perfect illustration is Rush’s
defense of George Bush’s
McCarthy-esque attack on Bill
Clinton’s patriotism on the “Larry
King Live” show during the 1992
election: ‘Maybe I’m old-fashioned,
Larry, but to go to a foreign country
and demonstrate against your own
country, when your sons and daugh-
ters are dying halfway around the

THE PITT NEWS

world? I’m sorry, I  I just don’t like
it. I think it is wrong.”
, So how did Rush explain away
a statement that any normal person
would ‘realize is an attack upon Bill
Clinton’s patriotism? Limbaugh
went on his show the next day com-
plaining: “He didn’t assail Clinton’s
patriotism  Now let’s roll Bush on
‘Larry King Live’ last night and, you
be the judge.” To prove Bush’s inno-
cence, Rush played a clip from a
totally diﬁerent pan‘ of the interview.
One observer noted that
Limbaugh “epitomizes a terrible fact
about American life today:
Extremism, ego and irony sell.
‘Remember this above all else,’
Limbaugh said on his show, ‘my
success is determined by who wins

elections, my success is determined I

by how many listeners I have.’ In
other words, as long as he gets his,
that’s ﬁne.”

The good news is that it looks
like Rush’s inﬂuence is fading fast
now. His television show was can-
celed a short time ago because of
declining ratings, and his once—rabid
listeners became angry last year that
their leader sold out to the

Republican establishment by endors- I

ing Bob Dole instead of Pat
Buchanan, whom a large contingent
of his listeners support.

VV1th the Republicans in the
uncomfortable position of having to
be leaders and being held account-
able for their actions, instead of being
rebels with a cause, it’s no surprise
that a bomb-thrower with no ideas
like Rush has suddenly found him-
self out of his element All I can say
is good riddance. ’

Fast track is essential for free trade to be effective

Heather

Barnett

International trade, it is pretty much
universally agreed, is good. In the clear—cut
world of Junior Achievement textbooks,
Country A makes the cheapest widgets,
Country B comes in with the best price on
thingarnabobs, and they both proﬁt by
swapping their surpluses. It all sounds fair-
ly straightforward —— Americans get stuff
we can’t make here, like coffee, the stu-
dent’s best friend; in retum, the rest of the
world gets wheat, soybeans and the latest
from those evil little programming gnomes
at lVIicrosoft.

So far, so good. The tricky part is actu-
ally implementing trade policies and nego-
tiating procedures in the complex global
economy. Enter S.253, the Trade
Agreement Implementation Reform Act,
better known as “fast track.” Once again,
it’s a simple concept: When the president
negotiates a trade deal with another country
(or countries), Congress has to give the
whole package a thumbs-up or thurnbs-
down. This way, an accord can’t be altered
with amendments specially tailored to the
needs of special—interest groups or laden
with irrelevant riders. It’s not a new idea —.
in fact, every president since Gerald Ford
had fast-track authority until it expired in
1994.

‘dealings. The legislation

Why, then, does it look like this seem-
ingly innocuous piece of legislation is
headed for defeat in the House of
Representatives? There are many. minor
issues arising from the
12 dense pages of I
legalese, but the major
disagreement boils
down to the long-stand-
ing debate over the place
of American political .
values in our economic

in its current form bars 7
labor and economic
issues from being-
included in (enforce-
able) core agreements, -
relegating them to (unenforceable) side
agreements.

Much of the Republican majority
opposes the bill, partly because the presi-
dent favors it, and partly because they fear
thatany mention of workers’ rights or the
environment, even in a side agreement,
could force America to toughen its own
laws. .

Most House Democrats are also lining

up against the bill, believing that workers’ a

rights and environmental standards belong
in the enforceable core agreement along
with nonhurnan—rights-oriented protections
such as copyright laws. Minority Leader

    

ﬁg ,-

Richard Gephardt surrnned up the feeling
of the Democratic opposition in his speech
at the AFL-CIO convention here in
Pittsburgh: “If intellectual property and
capital deserve protec-
tions in the core free-
trade treaties, with trade
sanctions to enforce it,
so do labor laws and
_ environmental laws, on
an equal basis.”
The White
House clearly wants this
legislation and has been
pulling out all the stops
to get it. Last month,
President Clinton made
a personal visit to
Capitol Hill to try to sway undecided
Democratic House members, a tactic
which is reserved for high-priority political
battles. Administration heavies have been
lobbying some of these same members
both on the Hill and at White House lunch-
es. The new food—safety measures the pres-
ident armounced this week were a direct
response to concerns that increased agricul-
tural imports have already compromised
the safety of America’s food supply.

The need for fast-track authority was
put bluntly by one anonymous White
House aide: “Unless we have this authori-
ty, no other country is going to put a serious

offer on the table.” Even if the United
States could get other countries to negotiate
trade deals without fast track, the process
would be interminable —- take, for exam-
ple, NAFTA. Fast track was still in effect
when the original deal was struck in 1993;
however, Congress has had to be consulted
in the implementation process no less than
600 times in subsequent years. (I should
note that the merits of NAFTA are still very
much in dispute. The White House says the
accord has created 160,000 U.S. jobs; labor
leaders say that 420,000 have been lost.)

We need fast track if we are to contin-
ue to prosper in the global economy, but
labor and environmental provisions have to
be enforceable. From a purely practical
point of view, we can’.t compete with the
prices of goods produced under slave-labor’
conditions. More importantly, however, a
We can’t stop all hurr1an—rights abuses
around the world, but we certainly don’t
have to bankroll them with our trade dol-
lars. We can’t pretend that economic policy
can be neatly divorced from its human
dimension; I believe we can hit a balance
that allows us to engage in trade with a con-
science. The bill before Congress right now
just doesn’t happen to be it.

Heather Bamelt believes that the invisible
hand should never override the human
heart.

The recent scandalous activities of
the Student Government Board clearly
showcase the cause of worldwide degen-
eration: capitalist greed.

Justin DalMolin may not have stolen,
but in overspending by using the capital-
ist system the students of Pitt have come
to bathe in, he has screwed me and
screwed you. He drove around
Philadelphia in a Lincoln Town Car --
the ultimate symbol of bourgeois oppres-
sion. How many workers bled and sweat-
ed while making that car? And he ﬂew to
Philadelphia, obviously using
USAirways, who have tried time and time
again to throw Tearnster recruiters out of
their offices. And he stayed at a four—star
hotel. Eh! What a decadent student presi-
dent we have. Imagine Ronald Reagan
with half the Alzheirner’s and three times
the incompetence! .

Friends, comrades, something must
be done.

Elections are rubbish. The bourgeois
hierarchy in this university ensures that
only students who have been brain-
washed by the Almighty Dollar run for
student president. In this system, come
November, DalMolin and his friends will
be replaced by more Ted Turner
wannabes. No, it is clear that more drastic

SGB and Allocations are just

measures are needed to get rid of
DalMolin, Klayman and their ilk. I pro-
pose we demonstrate outside the dean’s
office, and take all Evian water away
from the top faculty. By doing this, we
shall force them ‘to dissolve the SGB, and
replace it with my brainchild — a Student
Collective Committee. I, as leader of this
new faction, will do away with all this
capitalist rubbish. And come the glorious
day, we will erect a 20-foot statue of Karl
Marx on the Cathedral lawn.

But these things later. The proletariat
will win, no doubt about it. But for now, I
will educate you. The SGB is supposed to
represent the students. Did I hear laugh-
ter? Thought so. Why does this sound like
such a bloody silly notion? Is it because
the SGB doesn’t do that? Look how they
usurped power unto themselves and
secretly brought in a new scab Allocations
Committee. The old committee should
receive our thanks for showing us the bad
apple in DalMolin and Klayman. Their
resignation was heroic, and come the day
of the SCC, I will not forget them.

Pictures speak a thousand words.
Look at the photo on the front cover of the
Sept. 15 issue [of The Pitt News], where
the SGB members are drinking beer at
Seven Springs ski resort and enjoying an
opulent holiday at our expense. Eh, what
decadence! Look at their laughter.

And we must applaud Brett Taylor

and Shawn Watts for their tenacity in
uncovering the secret Allocations
Committee meeting. The photo on page 4
of the Sept. 29 issue, looking, in on the
scab Allocations Committee members,
was pretty impressive, considering he was
getting a photo from outside the meeting
room — a room on the 40th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning. Comrade Watts
overcame fear and vertigo, hanging from
the outside of that buliding, four-hundred
feet above the ground, and his actions will
not be forgotten come the day of the SCC.
And a bottle of vodka in tribute to Editor
in Chief Anthony Breznican for his rest-
less pursuit of the truth every student
needs to know. Come the glorious day of
the SCC, government and newspaper will
work together as one for the good of the
students.

Christa Douaihy’s “Screw them all”
is just the sort of thing a prospective man-
ager at Merrill Lynch would say to her
workers. She treats us like dogs, thinking
the views of the masses are subordinate to
those of Justin “Dollar” DalMolin. Eh,
what is this rubbish? The masses have

spoken, and we will not be intimidated by
the SGB battle-ax. She may frighten SGB
capitalist rivals, but student solidarity,
unity and strength, above all, will make
her words the last ramblings of the last
capitalist-motivated student—govemment
member ever.

The issue will not go away, and it
shouldn’t. We, as a united student move-
ment, should not take nonsense and over-
spending lightly. They do the odd good
thing — I like the idea of students around
Pennsylvania uniting. Yes, as a force of
one, we of Pitt, Penn State, the University
of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon,
Temple and more, will show the fascists
in Washington, D.C., that the youth of this
country are pissed off. But we can’t do
this when DalMolin is whoring our
money and the Allocations Committee is
under his power. The SCC will end all of
this. Power for all, not power for one.

Come the glorious day, the SCC will
prevail.

And in conclusion, while capitalists,
with a fat wallet, a fat head and fat in their
girth run this country, it’s the youth. of
America who will replace them. And I
hope we will all see the light in the doc-
trine of Karl Marx and strive for unarri—
mous worldwide peace.

Local
establishments
have increased

  prices

I’m writing to report an inaccuracy
in a front-page story that ran in the
Thursday, Sept. 11 issue of your paper.
In the story about the new minimum-
wage hike, entitled “Employees praise
higher wages, fear inﬂation,” Rana
Hira reported that McDonald’s was
among the local establishments that
had “decided to absorb the cost of pay-
ing higher salaries without raising
prices.” The statement is inaccurate
because the McDonald’s on Forbes
Avenue has raised some of its prices
recently, sometime during the last few
weeks. Indeed, McDonald’s is one of
several Oakland establishments I
know of that have raised prices since
August. Given the timing of the price
hikes, I wonder whether they are due
to the minimum—wage increase, to the
return of unsuspecting undergraduates

THE PITT NEWS

or to some other factor. Nevertheless,
McDonald’s has raised some of its

prices.

Public doesn’t
appreciate West's
dedication

I was watching the Pittsburgh vs.
Houston football game from my humble
dorm room that Saturday afternoon. The
game was on Fox Sports Pittsburgh. 1,
being a football fan, know the differ-
ence between announcers and know
which station has the best armouncers. It
is not Fox Sports. But that is beside the
point.

There is a crucial third-and-one
play, and with the emergence of
Dwayne Schulters over the past year,
I’m thinking that the play call is going
to be to him. But to my shock, Billy
West is placed into the offensive set, and
a play is called for him. Well, he doesn’t
get the big gain, but it’s no big deal

since we still end up winning the game.

Then the armouncers come out with
a statement something close to the fol-
lowing:

“That would not
have happened if Billy
West would attend
practice as much as his
teammates.”

“Well, what can
you expect from some-
one that doesn’t attend
practice every Tuesday
and Wednesday
because he has to go to
class?”

They said that he
was a “disappointment
to the Pittsburgh pro-
gram” and a “frustra-
tion to new Head
Coach Walt Harris.”

This comes from an armouncer who
was probably some washed-up football
player who couldn’t make the NFL, and
because he didn’t have any other talent
in life, he decided to become a broad-
caster. And he wasn’t very good at that
because he got stuck covering a
Pittsburgh vs. Houston game on the

lowly Fox Sports network.

I don’t see Billy West as a disap-
pointment at all, and I would hope that
Coach Harris does not
either.

Instead of
armouncers ridiculing
Billy West for his
decision, he should be
held in high esteem.
As a computer science
major, I know how
hard classes can be.
Billy West is an elec-
trical engineer (if I am
not mistaken), which
is a very difficult dis-
cipline, too. West has
to balance not only his
books, but his lifting,
practice and condi-
tioning on a daily
basis.

West realizes that he may not make
the NFL, and he is working hard to
make something out of his life. Let’s not
criticize him on national television for
his decision. I want to congratulate Billy
in his choice of “brains over brawn.

Laoff, empty  

Vet drain
Panther energy

Pitt’s 17-13 loss to Temple on Saturday
was demoralizing and pathetic at best.

Howcanateamthatpulledoifthe
biggest Panther win in more than half a
decade come out so ﬂat and uninterested in
winning a ball game?

It was sad to see this team, which thou-
sands of newly interested fans are rooting
for, stink up Veterans Stadium in front of Pitt
fans, who outnumbered Temple’s fans near-
ly two to one.

And the crowd was part of the problem.
It wasn’t the lack of Pitt fans that hurt the
Panthers; it was the absence of any kind of
crowd at all. Veterans Stadium holds over
60,000 spectators for football, and the
armounced crowd of just over 10,000 (they
looked more like 3,000) weren’t nearly
enough to muster any kind of game-time
atmosphere. There was more hoopla sur-
rounding last week’s international wiener
roast than the game at the Vet.

The only hoopla to speak of was the
annoying announcer who laughed when Pitt
messed up, and the donnybrook between
the Pitt Panther and the Temple cheerlead-
ers. ‘

Part of playing on the road is compet-
ing not only against the opposing team, but
also against the rarnbunctious taunts and
jeers of crazy college-football fans. Walking
into a concert-sounding stadium gets any-
one excited. 7

In the spacious, Three Rivers-look-a-
like Vet, there were no insults of any kind —
not even one “S—t on Pitt” was uttered

Temple’s fan support is pathetic, but the
50,0()0-plus empty seats work wonders to 

take the opposition off its game.

A team is already overconﬁdent before
playing Temple. The Owls are best known
for alumnus Heathclitf Huxtable (a.k.a. Bill
Cosby, or Fat Albert, if you prefer), not good
football teams. They’ ve won just one bowl
game in their history, and since joining the
Big East in 1992, they’ve notched just three
victories — two of them versus Pitt.

So, an incoming team expects to win,
butbecausetherearenofansofanysort,
there is no excitement or enthusiasm, and
the visiting team comes out ﬂat

A good team can overcome this, but
Pitt can’t alford to play without any emo-
tion, and therefore the Panthers lost

Owls burst Pitt’s bowl bubble, l7-l3

Kevin Lilley

Sports Editor

PHILADELPHIA — Pitt Panther Bowl
Quest 1997 was derailed Saturday, possi-
bly for good. V

Taldng a winning record into week
ﬁve of the season for the ﬁrst time since
1991, the Panthers entered Sa111rday’s con-
test at 1-4 with Temple as a seven-point
favorite.

The crowd at Veterans Stadium was
small. The Panthers had momentum, beat-
ing 22nd-ranked Miami at Homecoming
in their last game.

The Owls didn’t care. ,

Temple piled up 225 yards rushing
against Pitt’s much—hyped Mad Dog
defense, held Pitt’s heralded West Coast
offense to 74 yards on the ground, and
scored a 17-13 upset over the highly publi-
cized Panthers.

Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris had been
warning fans, followers and reporters not
to believe the hype for much of the season.
After Saturday’s loss, he had the opportu-
nity for I—told—you-so’s he probably never

A wanted to say.

“I’ve been telling you  that we have
a long ways to go,” said Harris. “You saw
more of that today.”

nesses on display early in the game.

tion mark throughout the week, and after a
three-play drive to open the contest,
Panther punter Grant Cofﬁeld booted a 22-
yard punt to conﬁrm any lingering fears.

Temple, getting the ball on its 48,
began a series full of quick passes and mis-
directions to confuse and dismantle the
Mad Dog defense. Temple quarterback Pat
Bonner went tl1ree—for-three on the early
possession, driving the Owls to the 4-yard-
line.

On the last play of the drive, Owl run-
ning back Elmarko Jackson met one of
Pitt’s ﬁve new starters — rtmning back-

tumed—comerback Hank Poteat —— just
steps outside the end zone. Poteat, who had
already missed a tackle on the drive, was
bulldozed by Jackson, who hit pay dirt to
give Temple a 7-0 lead.

_ Pitt answered with a ﬁeld goal before
the quarter ended, making the score 7-3. .

Late-game sack pushes Temple past Panthers

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Panthers lost
Saturday’s game on a big play, but it
was only one of many throughout
the afternoon that could have made
the difference.

The play that lost the game was
a Decara Burgess sack of Panther
quarterback Pete Gonzalez for a 13-
yard loss. Pittsburgh had the ball at
the Temple seven-yard line with a
third and "goal, when Gonzalez
rolled back to pass and could not
evade the Owls’ rush. At this point,‘
the score was 17-10 in Temple’s
favor.

“There was a lot of determina-
tion and hollering in the huddle. It
was about who wanted to win the
game more,” Burgess said of the
time right before the sack.

After the sack, Pittsburgh Head
Coach Walt Harris decided that the
Panthers should attempt a field goal.
This stalled Pitt’s momentum —

without the sack, the Panthers
would have had a chance to tie the
game with a touchdown.

Temple Head Coach Ron
Dickerson was very proud of his
defense after this play.

“Our defense rose to the occa-
sion. They played their hearts out,”
Dickerson said. « r

The Panthers took themselves
out of a chance to tie the game with
this sack, but the sack also put
Temple in a position to win a game
that it had dominated.

The Owls could not capitalize
on turnovers and big plays early in
the contest, but they could not help
but win after this mistake.

Pittsburgh could not stop
Temple’s running attack and get the
ball back after this play. Temple got
a first down and was able to run out
the clock.

“You’ve got to have confidence
in what you do and believe,” said
Harris of the decision to attempt the

field goal. He said he believed his
defense could get the ball back.
Both teams had many big plays
that could have turned the game
around. Late in the fourth quarter,
Pittsburgh cornerback Tray Crayton
picked off a pass and returned it 18
yards. This play set the Panthers up
for a game-winning drive —— a drive
that never surfaced after Gonzalez
was dropped on third down.
Pittsburgh’s defense made
another huge play in the third quar-
ter. The score was 14-10 Temple
when the Owls drove to the
Pittsburgh 4 and were faced with a
fourth down and one. Kevin Harvey
handed the ball to Elmarko Jackson;
the defensive line surged forward
and stopped him. This gave the
Panthers the momentum for what
could be a game-winning drive.
After this play, Pittsburgh drove
down the field 57 yards. With the
ball near midfield, Temple, got a

The Pittsburgh Lady Panthers trav-
eled north Saturday to face oﬁ° against a
tough Syracuse Orangewomen squad.

Syracuse and Pittsburgh women’s
soccer share a common bond — this is
their first year competing in the Big
East.

"But the Orangewomen won 10
games last year; Pitt won three. In the
end, Syracuse took advantage of a young
Panther offense by shutting out Pitt 5-0.

The Orangewomen were led by
freshman forward Erin O’Grady, who
scored two goals on three shots.
O’Grady was joined by fellow freshman
forward/rriidﬁelder Sheri Shifren, who
also had two goals on three shots.

Sophomore midﬁelder Amy
Knoebel added one goal on two shots,
while goalkeeper Juli Slack stopped all
four Panther shots in the victory.

The scoring began at 16:38 of the
first half when O’Grady knocked in her
ninth goal of the year with an assist from
Knoebel. Just under three minutes later,
the Orangewomen increased their lead
to 2-0 with Knoebel’s first goal of the
year.
Knoebe1’s unassisted goal was a
direct kick from the left comer of the
goal box.

The third Syracuse goal came at
28:11 of the first half when Shifren
added to the rout her second goal of the
year, from the left side of the goal.

At the half, the Orangewomen left
the young Panther defense searching for

period.

In the second half, Syracuse wasted
little time in adding to its lead with a
goal from Shifren, her third of the year
and second of the game. Shifren’s goal
came at 53:33 of the second frame,
assisted by sophomore rriidﬁelder Jaime
Mingoia. Mingoia has three goals and
one assist on the year.

The Orangewomen sealed the victo-
ry at the 82:44 mark on a fifth goal com-
ing from O’Grady with an assist from
freshman Cindy Wolf. It was O’Grady’s
10th goal of the year and Wolf ’s fourth
assist.

' The Panthers were outshot in the
contest 22-4. But on the bright side,
Panther goalkeeper Nicole Bashor made

. eight saves in the loss.

“We still have to improve defensive-
ly and have to possess the ball more
offensively,” said Panther Coach Roland
Sturk. I
The Pittsburgh women’s soccer
team is still in a building process,

“We are still struggling. We are try-
ing to find conﬁdence, but we are a bet-
ter teani than last year,” said Sturk. This
is Pitt’s second season —— the first in the
Big East — and it faces a much tougher
schedule than last year thanks to the con-
ference competition. This schedule
includes . Villanova, Notre Dame,
Rutgers and Connecticut — teams that
are powerhouses in women’s soccer.

In fact, Notre Dame lost in the
championship round to North Carolina

over Colonials, Orangemen

Staff Wrlter

The Pitt men’s soccer team defeated
both the Colonials of Robert Morris
College and Syracuse University’s
Orangemen last week to improve its
record to 5-1-4.

On Wednesday, Oct. 1, Pitt played the
Colonials of Robert Morris College. In
this 2-0 victory, the Panthers recorded
their ﬁrst shutout of the season.

-The garne’s only two goals were

8 scored by Pittsburgh sophomore forward

Reagan Bender and freshman midﬁelder
Ben Garry. Reagan’s goal came early in
the ﬁrst half, at 15:09 into the game. The
assist for this goal was credited to junior
defender Travis Kruse. Garry’s score was
added late in the second half, with only
5:41 left to play. This goal was assisted by
sophomore defender Keith Blass.

There were also 13 shots on goal
attempted by Pittsburgh in this game.
There were four shots made by Bender,
three by Kruse, two each by Garry and
junior rriidﬁelder Phil Matilla, and one
attempt each by junior forward Drew
Kopp and senior defender Greg
Hoolahan.

Pittsburgh’s goalkeeper, sophomore
Jared Cochran, totaled six saves during the
battle with the Colonials.

This victory "was the fourth win for
the Pittsburgh Panthers. The team’s previ-
ous wins came against Oneonta State,

1 West Virginia and Providence.

The ﬁfth win of the season came for
Pittsburgh on Saturday, Oct. 4. The team

defeated the Orangemen of Syracuse by a ‘

score of 4-3.
Panther goals in this game were

scored by freshman forward Spencer
Barton, Bender and Garry, who scored
two for Pittsburgh. '

The gaIne’s assists were recorded by
senior midﬁelder Jason Piombino, who
had two, and Matilla and Garry with one
each.

Eleven shots on goal were attempted
by Pittsburgh in this game. Four of these
were tried by Bender and two each by
Garry and Piombino, Blass, Kruse and
Matilla each recorded one attempt.

Pittsburgh’s current leading scorer is
Matilla. He has totaled 14 goals for the
Panthers. Tied for second, each with seven
goals, are Kopp and Bender. Matilla and
Kopp also lead the team in shots attempt-
ed with 15 each.

Sophomore Jared Cochran and Senior
Chris Hanlon, the Panther goalkwpers,
have combined to allow only 12 opponent
goals this season. Hanlon has totaled three
wins and a single loss, while Cochran
totals one victory and no losses.

The Pittsburgh team this season has
recorded only one loss. This defeat was at
home by Rutgers University.

The team has battled to four ties so far
this year. Two of these were scoreless
stalemates. The scoreless games were
against Notre Dame in the season’s open-
er and Boston College; both were at home.

The men’s soccer team battles St.
Francis College on Tuesday, Oct. 7. The
game will be held at Pitt Stadium. Kickoff
takes place at 7: 15 pm. The Panthers will
remain at home until Sunday, Oct. 12,
when they play the Georgetown Hoyas.
Next, they will play at Canisius, and then

  olleyball loses three within city limits

Pitt downed at Duquesne, drops two more at home

Matt Grove

Staff Wrlter

Cindy Alvear, Pitt
women’s volleyball head
coach, hoped that three
straight matches in
Pittsburgh would get her
team ready for a tough six-
game road trip that will con-
sume the month of October.

Not, only did Pittsburgh

-fail to pick up momentum

before packing its bags, but
it stalled this past week,
dropping three straight
matches and falling to 7-7
on the year.

The Lady Panthers trav-
eled downtown to battle
cross-town rival Duquesne
Wednesday and fell 15-6,
10-15, 2-15 and 11-15.
Pittsburgh also came up on
the losing end in a pair of
home contests, with the first
loss coming Friday to
Georgetown, 12-15, 3-15,
15-5 and 9-15.

Saturday the Lady
Wildcats of Villanova roared
into town and. took a 15-9,
15-12, 10-15, 6-15 and 12-

15 match. A
This three-game skid
marks the longest losing
streak since early last sea-
son, when the Lady Panthers
dropped five consecutive
matches. That year, howev-
er, Pittsburgh went on to win

, 18 of its next 23 matches to

finish 22-11.

In the loss to the Lady
Dukes, 6’5” sophomore
Paula Zemrowski was the
only Lady Panther to reach
double figures in kills with
12. Tara Haefner led
Pittsburgh with 28 assists.

Duquesne got double-
figure kills from the trio of
Jenna Birkel (12), Beth
Murphy (11) and Sheila
Lopez (11). Nikki Taylor
had a game-high 35 assists.
The Lady Dukes, who beat
Pittsburgh for the first time
in 16 matches, raised their
season mark to 6-9 with the
win.
Three Lady Panthers —
Peggy Meinhart, Stacy
Renick and Marcia Thiesen
—— recorded 10 kills apiece,
but this wasn’t enough as

the visiting Lady Hoyas pre-
vailed in four sets. Haefner
and Lisa Riggle combined
for 44 assists in the loss.
Georgetown got 13 kills
from Elisa Davidson, 11
from Kiran Gill and a game-
high 40 assists from Taryn
Turney. Georgetown upped
its record to 7-6 with the
win.
The toughest loss of the

weekend, a two-hour, 10- 9

minute marathon, came
Saturday against Villanova.
Pittsburgh took the first two
games 15-9 and 15-12
before the bottom fell out.
Villanova swept the final
three games 15-10, 15-6 and
15-12 to go to 12-5 on the
season.

Zemrowski and Renick
once again led Pitt with 15
kills apiece, while Melissa
Alpers chipped in with 12.
Tara Haefner notched a
team-high 50 assists in the
loss.

‘Nova was led by Stacy
Evans’ 18 kills and Cathy
Arnette’s game-high 55
assists.

break. .

At this point, the score
was still 14-10 Temple. It
was third down with two
yards to go for the Panthers.

Gonzalez dropped back
and threw a deep pass to
Terry Murphy, who caught it
for a 25-yard gain. This put
the Panthers at the Temple
14-yard line —— at least until
Murphy fumbled the ball and
lost it to Temple.

This pass would have
given Pittsburgh the chance
it needed to take a lead early
in the second half.

“That was devastating.
We have not had enough
time to ingrain the things we
want to. _I want him to put
the ball away,” Harris said of
Murphy.

Temple’s Lamond
Adams returned the ball 21
yards to his own 35-yard
line. This play should have
given Temple the chance to
put the Panthers away, but
the Owls only moved the
ball 17 yards and were
forced to punt.

“He ran a good route. I
got beat but hustled to him
and did what I’m taught in

snow: PAGE 10

practice,” Adams said.

What he is taught in
practice, according to
Adams, is to knock the ball
loose.

Both teams enjoyed big
plays resulting from the
same pass, but neither could
capitalize due to mistakes.
Either team could have
seized control of the game at
this point, but neither team
did.

Early in the game, with 6

Temple leading 7-0,
Gonzalez threw a pass that
was picked off by Adams.
Temple had the chance to
take a big lead at this point

in the game, but once again,

it could not capitalize. Pat
Bonner threw a pass to
Kevin Walker, who got to the
20-yard line, but Pittsburgh
forced a fumble to stop the
Owls’ momentum.

Unlike on their other big
plays, after this drive the
Panthers did come away
with a field goal. They took
some of the confidence they
gained and used it to march
down the field 47 yards and
got on the board with three
points. ,_

week that Pitt would “mix it” on offense,

but Ternple’s run-stoppers killed those plans '

early in the contest.

On the Owls’ next drive, Bonner was
subjected to a one-man wrecking crew ——
Panther safety Curtis McGhee. McGhee
made three tackles on the drive, including
two punishing hits on Jackson. The Panther
defender also forced an incornpletion by
"pressuring Bonner and hammering the Owl
quarterback the instant he threw the ball
away.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
McGhee oouldn’t stop Temple himself.
Bonner led the Owls on a 70-yard drive,
ending with Jackson’s dive into the end
zone and giving Temple a 14-10 lead.

After the half, Pitt was exposed in
earnest to the Owls’ dual-quarterback
attack Bonner had done much of the dam-
age early in the game but had given way to
backup Kevin Harvey at various points dur-
ing the ﬁrst two quarters.

To start the third period, though, the
Owls made ﬁve quarterback changes on
their opening drive, with Harvey rrmning
the option play on early downs and Bonner
entering to throw passes on late downs. The
Panther defense ﬁnally made a stand at the
Pitt 4 to stop the drive, but the two—general
march took over six minutes off the game
clock

Pitt safety John Jenkins downplayed
the signiﬁcance «of the quarterback switch-
mg.

“We just had to keep looking to see
whoever is in,” he said.

Harvey recorded 72 rushing yards for
the Owls, throwing just one pass (an incom-
pletion) on the day. Bonner went 12 for 21
with 178 yards passing, and ran just four
times for 14 yards.

The Panthers stuck with Gonzalez
throughout, and appeared to be taking com-
mand of the contest after getting the ball
back on their 4—yard-line. Thanks to three

crucial third-down completions (two to
Murphy and the ﬁnal one to Dwayne
Schulters), Pitt drove over half the ﬁeld,
earning a ﬁrst and 10 at the Temple 47.

Gonzalez was sacked on the next play,
but completed a swing pass to Billy West
for 10 yards on second down to bring up a
third and two. .

As he had done nine times already,
Gonzalez ﬁred a completed pass to Terry
Murphy. This one was good for 25 yards
and an easy ﬁrst down.

But, as he hadn’t done all game,
Murphy fumbled Temple recovered and
gnoundouttherestofthehalfwithits option
rushing attack, led by Harvey. To further
complicate matters, Murphy was injured on
the play, and McGhee was knocked out of
action1aterinthequa1'ter.'I'heextentoftheir
injuries remains unknown.

Harvey would be replaced by Bonner
neartheend ofthe period on athird- -13
passing situation. Bonner threw a high-
arching spiral far downﬁeld that was picked,
off by Pitt’s Tray Crayton. Crayton returned
it to the Panther 18, giving Pitt one ﬁnal
chance at a tie.

Gonzalez quickly threaded the double
coverage on ﬁrst down, hitting Hoffart for
10 yards. But after an unsuccessful dive by
West, an incompletion and a‘ 12-yard loss
thanks to a sack,.the Panthers faced a fourth
and goal from the 18 with 2:26 left in the
game.

» Harris opted for a ﬁeld goal, which
Chris Ferencik made. His hopes of getting
the ball back were dashed after the Owls
took the ensuing kickoff, rattled off two ﬁrst
downs, and ran out the clock

“I felt like we could kick it deep, back
them up,” said Harris of the decision.

But like Coﬂield’s punt early, Paul
Ruzila’s kickoff in the ﬁnal minutes played
into Ternple’s hands. It was a line—drive,
wobbling kick (Harris called it a “debacle”)
that was returned to the Temple 34, despite
the Owls having their onsides—kick team in
the game instead of regular kick—retum
blockers.

he was forced to pitch, Pitt’s comemacks
cou1dn’t tackle either of TeInple’s nmning
backs. The two Temple backs combined for
135 yards.

HarVey’s alter ego, Pat Bonner, was a
productive 12-for—21 for 178 yards. He was-
n’t spectacular, but he made plays when he
had to. .

Pitt’s inability to stiﬂe Temple’s option
Iunning game was magniﬁed when the
Owls ran out the clock at the end of the
game with two key ﬁrst—down runs. Walt
Hanis’ decision to go for the ﬁeld goal
instead of a touchdown when down by
seven points looked horrible when it
became obvious that his defense couldn’t
get the ball back.

The bye week (actually, closer to two
bye weeks) interfered with Pitt’s obvious
momentum after its win against In
the postgame press conference, safety John
Jenkins admitted that the team wasn’t ready
to play. He and quarterback Pete Gonzalez
were dumbfounded after the defeat.

They were still sporting the puzzled
visages that they must have worn all day.
During the game, there was a tremendous
amount of confusion on the ﬁeld and the
sidelines. On many occasions, players were
subbing on and off the ﬁeld as the ball was
snapped, the play clock often ran down to
under ﬁve seconds and players’ heads we1e
hanging dejectedly.

This was a devastating loss, but “there’s
still a lot of football to play,” as Gonzalez
said Pitt, although the Panthers will never
admit it, got caught up in the fan and media
hype. They went: humbled by Temple, and
now they will lose some of this town’s atten-
tion. Now there is less pressure and fewer
expectations, so Pitt can just concentrate on
playing winning football.

The Panther offense is led by Charity
McClure and Renee Spampinato.
