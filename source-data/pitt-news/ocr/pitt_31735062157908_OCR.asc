magazines, as well as in books of
verse, such as “I’m A Stranger_
Here‘, Myself,”.«and “Good Inten-

The Pitt News becomes. more of
a University student publication
next year with theinstallation of
the relatively-new Vari-type pro-
cess of type-setting. _

One Vari-type machine has al-
ready been delivered, and another
is to be purchased.

Under present plans, both the
News and the Panther magazine
will use the machines for setting
up their copy. Papers and maga-
zines will then be printed on off-
set presses. Only the printing will
be done away from the Cathe-
dral. ’ '

First publications example of
this methgd will be the ﬁnal edi-

sue. But it is not being set on the
new machine here.

’In making the switch, the News
joins. the Duquesne Duke of the
Pittsburgh district college papers
using the Vari-type process.

The Publications Board author-
ized the change from thelinotype
method,.used by the News down
through the years, after a com-
plete study of the costs of pub-
lishing the various publications.
Rising fpr-inting costs in recent
years doubtless inﬂuenced the
Board. - ‘

It has long been the wish of
publication and journalism offic-
ials to centralize the production of
the publications at Pitt. Their

ideas have been incorporated into

future building plans of the Uni-

versity.

“Although the introduction of
Vari-type does not. mean an in-
crease in the number of issues
we’ll be putting out a week‘ next
year,” Editor Don Giffin said, “It
will mean a larger staﬁ and a" need
for closer cooperation both from

.the staff and our news sources.”

A Vari-type machine resembles 9'
a typewriter, only a bit larger and
more complicated to operate. It’s
keyboard for letters is arranged
in an identical pattern.

The Chicago newspapers, whose
linotype operators have been on
strike for more than a year, use

this process in setting" up their -

daily papers. __

Not All Successful

Events during the week—long Spring Festival, in general,
attracted large crowds. The Carnival on “the Forbes Street
(‘atliedral lawn tumbled previous attendance records during
its tliree—night stand. Pitt Players staged “Dark of the Moon”
to near-capacity houses in Foster Memorial. Other affairs drew
respectable attendance. - i .

But \V'ediiesday night, with only the Carnival to combat
for the attention of Festival-goers, the Music Festival at Soldiers
and Sailors’ ‘Memorial ﬂopped. Not because of the” program.
The best musical. talent on campus———the concert band, men’_s
glee club. and the Pitt Singers—joined hands for the'ﬁrst
time to give Festival a dash of musical color and a inajor mid-
week attraction. -

It just didn’t attract. Not more than a hundredpersons
occupied seats in the big Memorial. auditorium, a far cry from
the University ’s last student assemblythere to celebrate the
brilliant 7-0 football ‘upset of Penn State back in November.

The failure can hardly be blamed onla lack of culture
among Pitt students. Some certainly take no stock that poetic
fragment, “Music hast charms to sooth the savage breast.”
Some would sooner bend an-ear toward a blaring-'~jukebox than

I the higl-ier type of music that was presented at the Music Fes-

tival. But certainly not a very large percentage of the stu-
dent. body.

A better place to flag. the fault would be on the Festiv_al

‘ _T)l'(.)f_>,'l'aIl1. en tot_o, ‘and its publicity. Emphasis was centered on
 Tap Day, Carnival, the Main Ball, and “Dark of the Moon. ”'

Boosts for" the musical show went, for the. most part,
wanting, when it needed the tub-‘thumping more than any-
thing else. It was a new wrinkle and tended to attract a more
select audience than the others. .

,The chance r_einains for student music-lovers to make
ainends to the school ’s musical organizations. The glee club
has a concert scheduled Friday night at Carnegie Music Hall.
If their publicist ﬁlls‘ us “out, we"ll]see what we can do ‘to
help counteract last VVednesday’s disappoiiitineiit and show that
music is n'ot a lost art. at Pitt.

I guess at one time or another
during a student‘s stay (I say stay
because it seems to me that Pitt
is a vacation, at the end of which
you are handed a sheepskin say-

mg “I graduated from

A here at Pitt, they like tovblow off

steam to a lot of people who (and
I quote) “DID THEM WRONG.”
Here is a story personally told to
me by Mr. I. Didit Also:
~ “I came to Pi_tt in September,
1946 all hepped up about the idea.
that I had been accepted to the
one and only (building, that is) U.
of Pittsburgh. ' . ’

PITT” came as a result .of my
trying out for the freshman team
in basketball. There I met‘ the
peace-loving Doctor—Doc ~Carl—
son. If you’ve ever had '1-light
lunch of ' raw onions, pickles,
horseradish, topped with Spurroni,
you’ve met ‘Doc’ and his “ice-
cream eaters.’ M
“Trying to forge ahead both
scholastically and culturally, I
took 3 two credit course in Ety-
mology. Did you know that "the
scientific‘ name for sclosis is
P N E U MONOLTRAMI‘CROSCO-
PICSILICOVOLCANONIOSIS?
“Next came my big chance to
get intola few activities—ﬁrst was
the DIVINE ORDER OF FRA-
TERNITIES, and soon came some
small time jobs like ‘licking the
stamps and backs of about 4,568,-
5432.5venvelopes to send to that
many Cap & Gown Alums; mak-
ing sure that the seventh picture
down from the left hand side of
page 22 was in line with the sev-

hand side of page 96 ofvthe Owl
yearbook. The latter job was real-
ly a ,toughy.’’ ,

Skipping over a few insigniﬁ-
cant years, this same dejected
soul, now a Junior was given a,
break. A certain Carnival chair-
man by the (ﬁctitious) name of
Ted said he would be able to do
quite_a bit of work for the Spring
Carnival. Here is I. Didn’t report
on wot hpppened: :

,“_Ted told me to _gq..see Flo (an-

think she must‘ still be" in'Mex-
ico looking for Joe. My next move
was to see a small smooth looking
guy with a trademark of Mort
(need I remind you that this also
is as ﬁctitious as the other two
names). This. fellow .. was really
glad to have me—he only had ﬁfty
bills he wanted me to make up be-
cause he had other plans for the
evening. ' ' ' ,
“And then one day I chanced
to see Flo. She ran out of dough
and was looking for Joe at the In-
fo desk, C of L. She could only
remark something like this (no
quotes this time) —-_ Gads, you

n probably know more than I do.

Do I look like a ,wheel?

“So after banging my head pp
against the blackboard under an
Iron Curtain in the Russian room,
I decided that maybe‘ I was bet-

V ter off as a splinter of one of the

spokes of one,ot' the wheels that
make this school go around. I
‘surely wouldn’t_want my name to
be tramped on thru all eternity.”

During the course of this sad
story, Mr. I Didit told me that if
some day heg-ave about $20,000,-
000 (in round ﬁgures) and knew
that his suggestions would‘ be
heeded and his son would get into
Med School, the ideas would go
like this:

‘_‘A Tom Hamilton. in
classroom along with a sign that
would read, “DON’T LET ANY-
ONE KID YOU — WE’VE GOT
THE SPIRIT’; a Pitt News issue

on elections before they occured;
and lastly, bigger staffs so we
could have more wheels.” ,.

his kindly advice on blowing oﬂ
steam, I remain your lost week-

ll

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

This page is supposed to be devoted to sports, and ‘this
space is normally intended for a sports column. Yet I believe
it urgent to write something today in the nature of a ﬁnancial

column.

In the ﬁrst place, the employment situation is, Mr. Tru-
man, getting a bit too tight for comfort.

To illustrate, I know one

young man in particular who

in June -will be out of school foi

"three summer months and has yet

to locate a position.

Sunday he scanned the help
wanted pages.’ Therein he found
listed such choice opportunities
as: . -
“Salesman -— Children’s Un-
derdear —— ‘Little Miss Dixie’
Rayon Knit Panties—Commis-
sion.” '

‘fPainters—15 Years Experi-
ence.” _ .

“$25.00 ,a Day. Sell Solid
Brass Name Plates for Front
Doors—Retails $2-.50—Yo,u Make _
$1.00.” ‘  ..

As though the above weren’t
bad enough, Mr. Chuck Ebert,
head of the University’s place-
ment service, has to top off the
picture by telling our young man

that there are 200 applicants for
every decent -job he has.

‘Now perhaps the fellow is hav-
ing a difficult time because he is
too particular. True, he is not de-
manding a highsalary, but he has
ruled out night work and com-
mission pay. At anyjrate, his em-
ployment problem remains un-
solved.

For the sake of ethics, I will.

only mention his initials—MK.
But you may forward job sugges-
tions to him in care of this de-
partment. -

P. S.—-When‘ the "editor sees this
column, he will undoubte

salvation lies in the fact that he
seldom has the stomach to read

In Struggle

By STANLEY SKIRBOLL
Softball may bring the ﬁrst major all-campus title to the fra-

ternities this year. In both football

have lost each time to the Independent champions. , .
This year surprisingly weak independent teams should not offer
too much opposition to the Greeks. The Professional and Engineer-

ing leagues may produce a dark-0
horse, buttheir curtailed schedule
probably will h a m p e r their
chances. v

Three independent winners have
already been decided. Johnstown
Association has clinched top spot
in their league, by capturing two
close decisions, a 5-4 win over the
Coal Barons and a 4-3 victory over
the YMCA Wiseman.

Comets Surprise

The other independent cham-
pion, the Comets, upset a favored
Faculty team, 5-1, to retain an un-
blemish record, and capture ﬁrst
place intheir league.’

The Professional school winner
is the Psi Omega, also ending the
season with an untarnished record.

It may require a picnic to deter-
mine the Engineering School
champion. The Electrical Engineer
Superheats and the Petroleum
Oilers, both winners in their re-
spective leagues, have asked per-'
mission to play off their title dur-
ing the annual Engineering picnic.
' _ Frats Prolong Race

While all the other leagues are
ﬁnished, the frats are still cavort-
ing around, trying to .pick a win-
ner. Since the ﬁrst two teams in»
each section must play each other
for the all-point standings as well
as the IM.race, a complicated play-
off arrangement is underway._ A

In. Section I, the Phi Delts, Phi
Eps, Phi Kaps, and Alpha Phi
Delts, are all stillin the running
for the ﬁrst two spots. Crucial
games this week ﬁnd the APD
meeting the Phi Delts and Phi Eps.

Runs and more runs were the
order of the day in Wednesday’s
IM softball. ,A total of 61 runs
were talliedlin just four games.

The Mechanical Engineer Su-
perheats were forced to go eight
innings to defeat the Industrial
Engineers, 14-13. The winners tal-
lied in every inning but the third
and seventh. The IE’s stayed in
the game with a seven run sixth
inning.

EE’S‘Score Dozen

Not to be outdown,.the Elec-
trical Engineer Superheats won
their game, defeating the ME Ac-
celerators, 12-7. Both pitchers had
good days at the plate. The win-
ning pitcher, Haﬁna, collected two
hits while scattering nine for the

opposition. Burosky, the .ME
pitcher, collected four hits in ﬁve
trips to the plate. A

.The Comets slugged their way
to another triumph, winning over

a home run to the winning cause.

In the day’s only pitchers battle,
ﬁve hits were all the Johnstown
team required ,to defeat the,
YMCA, 4-3.‘ The Johnnies got
three hits and three runs in the

ﬁrst inning and bunched two more
for the winning tally in the sixth.

Against Tech

Pitt will take a short jaunt over
to the Carnegie Tech campus to-
morrow to meet the Tartan net-

mean anything, the Panthers
should win easily.

up against a- Panther squad with
a nifty record of 8-1.

ALL-CAMPUS TRACK MEET

By BOB LEVIS

It must be rather disappointing
to four members of Carl Olso'n’s
track squad to be listed on the
roster but still not be able to run.

That’s the predicament some of
Olson’s top runners have been in
this year. Injuries have kept them
sidelined the best part of the sea-
son, and it is doubtful if any will
be on hand in the remaining meet
with Miami of Ohio or the IC4A’s
late this month.

season’. Despite the lengthy_injury

'Y' Secretary To Leave Pitt:
Successor Chosen For July

J. Frederick Miller, executive secretary of the YMCA at Pitt for
the past ﬁve years, leaves June 30, to become associate secretary on
the national stalf of the Student YMCA in New York City. V

Alfred C. Payne, now of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, will suc-
ceed Miller, and begin his duties on July’ 15.

Mr. Miller came to the Pitt YMCA in the fall of 1944, just as
the ASTP units were leaving. It was his job to re-establish the

pre-war “Y” program.

Successful in his attempts, Mr.
Miller is responsible for such ac-
tivities as Freshman Camp, which
last year had a capacity enrollment
of 250 students; the Ellsworth
YMCA group; »Pre-Med Forum;
Breakfast Club, and Pitt Town
Meeting.

One of the'most successful pro-
grams which Mr. Miller initiated
was the Religion in Life week,
which began last year with one
outside speaker, and this year had
eight lecturers.

Mr. Miller also teaches classes in
Religious Service Organizations,
and History of Religion in the Col-
lege.

Mr. Payne is now YMCA Sec-

A
V’

retary at Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute. ,He*is a graduate of Yale
Divinity School, and has also done
“Y” work at Texas A & M.

In announcing this appointment,
Dean Biddle said, “We hate to see
Mr. Miller go, but feel that Mr.
Payne will be a worthy successor.”~

A decline in the size of future

cording to Mr. Batchelder. While
the enrollment is still very high,
Mr. Batchelder believes that the

will pull down the number of stu-
dents graduating in J uneé? 1950.
Barring an unforseen incident,
.such as World War II which pro-
duced a great inﬂux of veterans,
Mr.‘Batchelder does not visualize
a class, as large or larger than the
. present one, graduating from Pitt
in the future.
This year’s class exceeds last
June’s class by approximately 900
