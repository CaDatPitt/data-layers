Tele hone
frau reality
for students

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Phone calling cards are gaining popularity g

at colleges around the country due to the
discounts and convenience they offer stu-
dents, but some Pitt students are looking at
their bills and ﬁnding more than they bar-
gained for.

A On Tuesday, Oct. 12 a student reported
fraud in excess of $1,200 on his calling card

to campus police. That same day, campus ‘

police received a report of $847 of calls on a
telephone calling card and $40 on a student
access code. In both cases, calls were made
by a student using someone else’s calling
card. ' 1

According to Assistant Director of Public
Safety, Gary Moses, students should be wary
when using a calling card in public places.

“Many more students are using these
cards,” Moses said. ’ ’

“People are hanging around pay phones
and watching students enter their calling
card number from. behind. Once someone
has the number, they canpretty much call

anywhere at all.”

Moses said students must also protect
their student access codes, which are issued
by the Pitt Student Telephone Service.

“Some students post their personal access
codes near the phone where anybody can
see it,” Moses said. “Then anybody who
comes in the room can see it, and they can
tell anyone else.”

Pitt student Renee Clair said someone
used her calling card number for $50 worth
of calls last year.

“Actually, I didn’t report it tothe campus
police,” Clair said.

“I called the phone company and they
handled it. The guy was caught after a cou-
ple of weeks.”

The penalty for phone fraud conviction
ranges from a misdemeanor to a felony,
based on the amount of money involved.
According to Moses, those who use access
codes or calling cards illegally are usually
caught.

“People are fooled because the investiga-
tion takes between one and two months,”

Sigma Chi Derby Days support charities

By Wendy Parkhouse
For The Pitt News

Derby Days are here and Sigma Chi is
teaming up with 11 sororities to raise
money for various charities, including
St. Peter's Center for Child
Development.

“The main goal is to raise as much
money as possible and to have as much
fun- as possible,” Sigma Chi Brother
Andy Demming said.

Sororities involved in the Derby Days‘

compete for points in different cate-
gories, including creating a banner to
promote Derby Days, playing games on

the Cathedral Lawn and canning for
money.

“The competition in Derby Days is to
create involvement and fun,” Demming
said.

“Derby Days is a good opportunity
for the pledge classes to come to-
gether and work for a good cause,”
Delta Delta Delta member Julie B_ules
said. '

At last night’s “Maid for a Day Mixer,”
sororities bid for a brother who would
be their personal maid for a day to
clean up their sorority houses or per-
form similar duties. ’

“It’s a good cause and involves differ-

ent houses working together for the
charity,” Kappa Kappa Gamma
President LuAnne Pantalo said.

There will be a benefit concert held at
the Attic tonight. Sigma Chi will also
sponsor Sigendales, a mini—strip show
which involves 30 brothers in G-strings
on Friday night and will cost students
$5.

“The Sigendales is a mockery of
Chippendales and is one of our biggest
fundraisers,” Demming said. “We raise
about $12,000 to $15,000 all together
which I think is a pretty decent
amount.”

Student Government Boara’ elections   garner many applicants

By Frank Porco
and Matt Groff
The Pitt News

Giving power to the students
through the Student
Government Board seems to be
the goal of the 14 board candi-
dates and six presidential candi-
dates running this year.

According to board candidate
Eric K. McKinley, this is the
highest number of students run-
ning for SGB offices in over 10
years.

“With so many people run-
ning for office, the candidates
will be campaigning a lot harder
and getting to more people,”

board candidate Chris Fedeli
said. “There is definitely a
stepped- up level of excitement
around here.”

McKinley said the high num-
ber of people running for board
has also caused some tension
among the candidates.

“Things can get tense some-
times. You are friends with
them before running and then
you’re competing against them,”
he said. “There is not as much
talking done between the candi-
dates.”

Despite the atmosphere,
board candidate Elizabeth
Mania said she is glad for the
widespread interest.

“There is definitely an ele-
ment of stress,” Mania said. “But
I’m glad to see the participa-
tion.” .

Presidential candidate Tony
Moody said he agreed that the
high number of candidates will
make the SGB race more inter-
esting.

“I wholeheartedly welcome

more student participation,” he -

said.

Moody, who is currently a
board member, said. “But voters
will need to be informed on the
candidates’ positions, so they
are not just voting on who they
do and don’t like.”

Board candidate Heath

Golden said he is concerned
about people violating the SGB
election rules, which states that
campaigning should not begin
until Nov. 3. Electionday is
Nov. 17.

“A lot of people are already
starting to campaign even
though they are not supposed
to,” Golden said.

According to Fedeli, candi-
dates are feeling pressure to
meet more students and to be
remembered by them when
they go to the polls to vote.

McKinley said minority con-
cerns will be a popular topic
during the campaigning period.

“A lot of issues will be faced

and brought out into the cam-
paign limelight, such as the
establishment of an African-
American Cultural Center and a
center for women on campus,”
McKinley said.

According to Fedeli, another
big issue is the lack of commu-
nication between the SGB and
the student body.

“We are the representatives of
the student body,” he said. “We
need to keep students informed
as well as be informed by the
students.”

Fedeli attributes the student.

apathy in the past to the lack of
knowledge about SGB events.

Pitt joinsin to help

This year marks a decade of
over 3,000 college campuses
and communities‘ working
together to address one of our
nation’s greatest problems: alco-
hol misuse and abuse on cam-
pus.
The week of October 17, 1993
begins National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week,
(NCAAW) during which the
University of Pittsburgh will
again join this national effort to
develop campus environments
which encourage and support
healthy alternatives to drug
abuse and responsible decision
making,

This is no small scale affair.
Thisis a major worldwide effort
that attempts to counter this
worldwide problem, while
simultaneously targeting high

lation. Research shows that col-
lege students drink more than
the general population. The
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services indicates that
62 percent of
stu 
dents tend to 
be moderate;
to heavy 
drinkers com E
pared to 33 
percent of the 
general popu
lation.
Students pay
dearly for their drinking habits.
In general, the typical student
will pay moregmoney for alco-
holic beverages than for text-

 

 

books. The high price goes

beyond money. Academic
administrators believe that alco-
hol is a factor in 40.8 percent of
all academic problems and 28.5
percent of the dropouts.

  

In college, as well as every-
where else in society, males
drink more often and in heavier
amounts than females. Over
twice as many male students as

female stu-

In addition to college stu-

groups are at a higher risk for
experiencing alcohol-related
problems and the disease of
alcoholism.

The drinking patterns and
problems of whites is different
from those of nonwhites. Heavy
drinking is done mostly by
white men in the 18 to 29 year-
old category. (Remember that
this is the age category in which
most students fall.)

African American males of the
same age have a lower inci-
denceof problem drinking and
a" greater likelihood to abstain
from alcohol. Interestingly, the
same is true for African
American women. They are

Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic is hosting a sold-

regarding the treatment of
bipolar affective disorder,
more commonly known as
manic depression.

Jack Cahalane, one of the
course directors and clinical
administrator of-the Mood
Disorder Module at WPIC,

I said, “[Manic depression] is a
disorder that people have
intervals of alternating mania
and depression.”

According to Cahalane,
mania is marked by elevated
or expansive mood, highly
inflated I
decreased need for sleep, rac-
ing thoughts and distractibili-
ty. Depression is marked by
feelings of guilt or hopeless-
ness, loss of energy, loss of

out conference tomorrow,

interest in activities and suici-
dal feelings.

The conference is intended
for mental health profession-
als who are interested in
manic depression. According
to Cahalane, “The goal of the
conference is to provide an
understanding to people
about differential diagnosis of
patients and provide informa-
tion on treatment strategies
relevant to clinical practice.”

“Often people in the manic
episode don’t want treatment,
or they discontinue treatment
because they feel great [when
in the manic ‘ phasel,”
Cahalane said.

Manic depression affects
nearly 1 percent of the gener-
al population.

Cahalane said, “\Y/hen peo-
ple are manic their behavior is
extremely eccentric and
impulsive. They tend to use
alcohol to extremes, spend

WPIC to hold bipolar conference

vast sums of money, have
sexual affairs and travel vast-
ly. They tend to show
extremely poor judgement.”

Topics which will be dis-
cussed in the conference
include current medication
treatments, and a discussion
of a new type of therapy
that Cahalane said will help
patients to gain control
of their lives by making it
more predictable, Cahalane
said about the treatment
involved.

“Working with patients to
reduce interpersonal conflict
and organize their lives in an
effective manner to reduce
the risk of mania and depres-
sion,” Cahalane said.

The conference is part of
the National Public Education
Campaign on Clinical
Depression and the attendees
receive continuing education
credit.

dents. At this point you're prob-
ably thinking that black college
students are not at as high a risk
as their white counterparts.
Unfortunately, alcohol prob-
lems in the black community
are not less than, but are differ-
ent than those problems among
the white population. For exam-
ple, outside of the 18 to 19 year-
old_age group, “alcohol prob-
lem rates increase sharply for
blacks and alcohol -problem
rates remain higher for blacks
than for whites throughout mid-
dle age and old age.”

So, while black students may
experience less consequences
of college drinking, they experi-
ence even greater risk later in
life. '

Hispanics also demonstrate a

American males than among
their white or black counter-
parts. This pattern does not
extend to females, however.
Looking within the Hispanic
population, the trend is quite
different. A 1988 report suggest-
ed that Mexican American men,
a_s well as women, appear to
have a higher rate of alcohol-
related ‘problems than do Latino
American of Puerto Rico or
Cuban descent.

Don't despair! Race, ethnicity
and gender do not determine
whether one will have problems
related to drinking. Only the
amount and frequency of alco-
hol consumption directly relates
to the development of alco-
holism and alcohol-related
problems.

Financial aid for ﬁnancial neea’

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is ﬁghting
a battle that could affect people who have academically
earned the right to attend-a highly rated college but
lack the necessary funds to do so.

This ﬁght started in‘1991 when the Justice Department
charged MIT and eight other eastern colleges, Harvard,
Yale andPrinceton among them, with violating antitrust
laws. Like other groups of colleges, these nine schools
jointly decided how much aid to offer to those people
who were accepted to more than one of the member
institutions. They decided that this aid would be based
on ﬁnancial need not just merit. . .

According to USA Today (Oct. 20), .“Students with Ivy
League credentials, who can handle- Ivy League work,
are being rejected because theirparents’ income is too
low.” ‘ I

The U.S. is in danger of making collegeleducations

 available to only those elite enough to pay the $20,000

. tuitions. .

MIT, which has been fighting this battle alone is

attempting to alleviate this problem." It’s actions
advance a notion of equal opportunity which includes
providing equal chances regardless‘ of ﬁnancial situa-
tion. /.
» Former acting assistant. attorney general for the
antitrust division, J. Mark Gidley argues against MIT
saying, “without competition for financial aid, college
may become a luxury for the privileged few,” (USA
Today, Oct. 20).

But eligibility for financial aid is all ready too competi-

tive. Students are forced to compete for the less than
adequate amount of government funds available for
secondary education. If private colleges consider ﬁnan-
Ci31_' need when giving aid, that could ease the burden
of the government as well as the individual student.
- Although Gidley favors competitions as a_ means of
controlling admission rates, soaring college tuition
prices prove that this is not the answer. Many can still
not afford to. attend a university. '

Money is not the only thing hard to come by, so are
jobs.

In today’s job market, a college education is becom-
ing more the normthan the exception, so an education

V from a more prestigious, and most often more expen-

sive college is even more important. If these Ivy League
schools take into account economic need when deter-
mining ﬁnancial aid then we may see equal opportuni-
ties granted to those who have the ability but not the
money. i ‘ A .

Appeals court Judge’ Joseph Weis questioned, “why
the heavy artillery of antitrust has been wheeled into a
position to shoot down practices that so obviously

I advance the public interest?”

Hopefully, this time the lower courts will view the sit-
uation as '\X/eis did and side in favor of MIT and the
public good.

Mutual respect can end abortion debate

On October 18, Students for
Life sponsored a program on
Gianna Jessen, a 16 year-old
abortion survivor. Because it is
unlikely that an amicable agree-
ment in the abortion debate will
arise, I found myself searching
for some plausible solutions.
Since Catholicism is at the fore-
front of the theological and sec-
ular debate here in America, my
research began with an exami-
nation of the Catholic church.

During the ﬁrst 500 years of
the church’s existence, there
was not a_ single piece of legisla-
tion dealing with abortion. If
abortion was “morally wrong”
from the church’s inception,
why was it not declared? As my
quest for information contin-
ued, I finally located a declara-
tion by Pope Sixtus V in 1589
which stated: “the fertilized
ovum is a person, abortion is
infanticide, and any physician
who for any reason interrupts a
pregnancy is guilty of murder.”
‘At last, concrete evidence to
_prove that the church was
against abortion.

However, three years later in

1591, Pope Gregory XIV
revoked Sixtus’ doctrine.
Subsequent to his revocation,
abortion was not prohibited
by the church unless “quicken-
ing” (fetal movement) had

Milan 0 
Marinkovich

occurred; this did not happen
until after the 4th month of
pregnancy. '

This doctrine, “Apostolicae
Sedis,” was formulated in 1869
by Pope Pius IX. Once again,
the “official” church position
had changed.

Amidst this wavering dogma,
the leaders of Catholicism have
erroneously led their followers
to believe that abortion has
always been morally wrong.
Whose morals were correct,
those of Pope Sixtus V and
Pope Pius IX or those of Pope
Gregory XIV? “

As I pondered the relevance
of the accumulated data, a prac-
tical solution occurred to me.
Since Congress cannot make a
law “respecting an establish-
ment of religion”, or prohibit
“the free exercise thereof,” each
American should utilize_ this
inalienable right. ,

There is no religion that is
intrinsically bad, but when the
Catholic church attempts to
establish itself as the only
authority on abortion it violates
dissenting Americans freedom
to choose the religion and
beliefs of their choice.

My solution: Until another
Pope Gregory XIV appears, the
Catholic church will continue to
profess that abortion is morally
wrong. For those of us who dis-
sent, our only obligation is to
respect their view.point.
Likewise, if the church would

start to respect the opinions of I

those who disagree with them,
the "abortion controversy would
be history.  '

America and Mexico both lose with NAFTA.

I ﬁnd it the ultimate in ironies that I, as a social-
ist, should be agreeing with a capitalist billionaire
about an issue relating to the welfare of workers.
However, Ross Perot is absolutely correct in his
opposition to North American Free Trade
Agreement.

There is a saying that those who do not learn
from history are doomed to repeat it. There is in
history another free trade agreement - the Open
Door Policy in China. The British East India
Company imported opium into China converting
many Chinese into opium addicts. The foreign
capitalists who built factories there paid no atten-
tion to the environment or the health and safety
of workers in those factories. Little children
worked sixteen hours a day in factories where
they were often locked in at night. In match fac-
tories they got phosphorus burns all over their
bodies, and when they died, they; were simply
thrown on the trash heap for thedogs to eat.

' They were considered nothingmore than an

expendable input into a product.

Supporters of NAFTA say a similar situation
couldn’t occur today because child labor laws
exist and environn_ient-al organizations liave
power. Well, judging from the factories, I- think
they are being overly optimistic. Pollution near
these factories is so bad that ch_ildren are being
bqgt without brains or with numerous other terri-
ble birth defects.

NAFTA, in my opinion, is nothing but a smoke
screen for exploitation. ‘

American workers will lose because high-pay-
ing manufacturing jobs will translocate to Mexico
and be replaced by service sector jobs paying five
or six dollars an hour. Mexican workers will lose
because of pollution, low pay,“ bad working con-
ditions and no benefits. It is a lose-lose proposi-
tion for everyone except the American capitalists
who take advantage of NAFTA to increase their
profits. ‘e I ’

_ Andy Tsouris waited five long years for ,  .
this day. .

The Pitt soccer team’s senior midfield-
er, despite being a prolific scorer on his
high school team in Erie, PA, had not, as
of last night, tallied in a collegiate game.

Until 

Tsouris pounded ashot past Canisius
goalie John Hershey at 70:15 of the sec-
0nd half as all but finish the Panthers’
scoring, as Pitt went on to rout the
Golden Griffins 9-0.

“It feels real good, it’s something that I
miss from high school,” Tsouris said of
his first goal.’ “You get that feeling when
you pop one in and it’s goodto feel it
tonight.”

“Andy has been a real steady player
for us for five years,” Pitt head coachjoe
Luxbacher said. “He’s been through a lot
and I’m sure that scoring a goal before
he leaves is a big thrill.”

The Golden Griffins, who played more
like Merv Griffin last night, were blasted
for the second night in a row. After fac-
ing an 11-0 shutout at Robert Morris,
Canisius was spanked by a Pitt team
rearing’ to face Syracuse.

“We took an approach to work on dif-

ferent things to get ready for our game
lSunclay] against Syracuse,” Pitt sopho-
more forward Dean Astorino said.
I “I feel bad for a team that doesn’t quit
like that,” Pitt’s Eric Duffy, who ran his
points total to 16 last night, said. “They
really didn’t give up.”

“They didn’t hold back — they played.
the whole 90 minutes,” Jeff Potter, who
notched two goals and an assist, and
whose 17 points leads the Panthers, said.

Pitt opened the scoring in their sixth
win very early (4:10 in the first) when
Duffy ripped his fourth goal (he’d add
two assists) to put the Griffins in a quick year  when you get this age, you find

is winding down,” Tsouris said. “I just
wanted to make the most out of it and _
enjoy it because it’s something I’ll
remember the rest of my life.”

“Four years go very, -very quickly,”
Luxbacher said. “When you’re a fresh-
man you think that you’ve got all of
these games but they go so fast and
these guys are down to four or five
games now.”

Despite his heroics, Tsouris did not
take the game ball. He chatted with a
couple of friends, then ran up the
Stadium steps for home.

“I didn’t take the ball,” Tsouris said.
“When I score the big one in the Big
East Tournament, that's when I’ll take it.”

Although they don’t like to talk about
it, Duffy and Porter are staging what
appears to be a two-man show for the
scoring title on the squad.

“I don’t think there’s much competi-
tion, but if there is it’s a healthy competi-
tion,” Luxbacher said.‘ ‘

Regardless of the duo’s antics last
night, Tsouris easily stole the show.

After suffering through a redshirt and
foot injury that sidelined him -for all of
last season, he finally got to put one
between the pipes.

“I really wanted [to get the goal] this

  Woe Pitt News Interview: Pitt broadcaster Bill Hillgrove

In his quarter century as “Voice of the
Panthers,” WTAE’s Bill Hillgrove has
verbally chronicled the highs and lows

‘ "of Pitt basketball and football. In this

edition of The Pitt News interview,
Hillgrove turns a story or two on
johnny Majors, the state of Pitt football,
and his career in sports broadcasting.

The Pitt News: It’s a bit of a nerve-
wracking situation interviewing some-
one who’s interviewed people for a liv-
ing for twentysome—years. Do you
remember your first interview?

Bill Hillgrove: Yes. WKJF was an FM
music station. I was sent down to the 1
Hilton to interview Harry Morgan...

PN: Harry Morgan from M.A.S.H.?

BH: No (laughs). There’s another
Harry Morgan. He was a wit and a con-_
stant presence on “What’s my line?”
Anyhow, he was a curly haired guy —
an author and a very funny man. I

' remember interviewing him with a tape
recorder outside the Hilton. It was a

nice spring day —- the sun was shining

‘ — and he looked up on the hillside and

he saw all these old homes up there.
After the interview was over, he said
“why don’t the rich peoplelive up
there?” That was back in- 1967, and
Mount Washington was not upscale —
itwas ’a neighborhood. He had great ,
vision, because  the ensuing twen-

tysome years, it has become, the rich
man"s 

PN: What kind of view was there
back then, in terms of clean air, pollu-
tion?

BH: Well, the air had been pretty
much cleaned up in the ‘6_0’s. The ‘40’s
and ‘50’s were a different story. But that
was one of the first interviews I remem-
ber doing. ,

I [also] remember doing Bob Prince
and Jim Wood. Danny Murtaugh was
oneof the first TV interviews I remem-
ber. Danny was a great needler  and

t he knew I was a rookie and he knew I

was scared to death and awed by the _

.3/hole thing. [So] he called me “Bob”

intentionally a couple of times 

PN: [Laugh] He wasn’t exactly 20
years old, either. That’s early ‘70’s  he
died in ‘77, right? . . ‘

BH: Right. Exactly. This [interview]
would have been when I startedto do
some television — back in the early

. ‘70’s. This had to be ‘74-’73 —— some-

where in there. .
Well he called me “Bob” a couple of

' time, and then he turned and unloaded

one of the biggest juicy chews right on
the top of my white shoes. Now I don’t
know that he’s doing this on purpose .

.—- when I found out what kind of a guy »

he was. He was that kind of a" guy.

PN: Tell me interviews have gotten
easier.

BI-I: Actually, it’s probably easier to
be on your side of the interview than it
is on this side.

PN: You’re not chewing anything.

BH: (Laugh) Yeah. And the white
shoes are a bit passe’. I find it easier to

ask thequestions than to answer them, ,

because [as a reporter], you think in
terms of sound bites, in terms of good
quotes [when you get interviewed].

You’re almost manufacturing rather than

answering things from the hip —— you
almost try to control it from the [inter-
viewee’] end.

Really, a good interview shouldn’t be
controlled by the subject. It should just
come out and be there. «

PN: I want to start with football and
then get into your career. You’ve been
here since Johnny [Majors] got here ten
months ago —_- you’ve followed him as
much as anybody else. From what you
were expecting, can you assess this
football season to date. Are you sur-
prised by the way it has turned out?

BH: A lot of times when I watch a
team at camp, I watch effort and I
watch speed and size  and-I knew
this team was barely assembled; It’s

When you go into our second- and
third-teams — you’re talking about
walk-ons and kids of average ability. I
knew at camp that this team would be
lucky to win three, maybe four games. I
even saidto people “if [Pitt] wins five
games, [Majors] will get votes for coach
of the year — and if [Pitt] won six
games, he’d get coach of the year.”

I didntthink it would be as bad as it
has been, but at camp there’s not as
‘many injuries — people are there and

The _ Nightmare
Christmas

Story and Characters by Tim
Burton.

Music by Danny Elfman.

With the voices of Catherine
O’Hara,

Chris Sarandon, Ken Page.

Before

Tim Burton’s delightfully
skewed musical—fantasy-anima-
tion. extravaganza, The
Nightmare Before Christmas, is
undoubtedly the most complex

animation project to come out

of Hollywood in at least an eon.
Originally conceived by

Burton 12 years ago and then
subsequently shelved, the pro-
ject required it’s own studio, 20
separate stages for simultaneous
filming and two years of pro-
duction time.

The film is a combination of
frame- by—frame stop—motion
animation and 3-D sets lit in the
same way live action would be.
Burton’s meticulous investment
in detail results in a visual pay-
ola like no other. His characters
move with eerie ﬂuidity in every
spidery, stringy, spindly, oozy,
warty scene. The animated
“extras” are just as painstakingly
constructed, complete with a

Munch—esque screamer. The
sets are full of Burton’s familiar
lopsided angles and surprising
colors, and even the ground
and the trees are textured to
look like hardened lava that
someone went over with a huge
comb.

The star of Burton’s obsessive
melange of creatures is one Jack
Skellington (Chris Sarandon), a
skinny, praying mantis—like
skeleton who reigns over
Halloweentown and is responsi-
ble for making the holiday as
spooky as possible for all of us

Ainl’if Nobody’s Business wry, provoculive

Mildred Kaitz is not the usual
woman facing a drug charge.
This seventy—nine year old
grandmother is on probation for
growing marijuana in her back-
yard out of love.

It was not her love for the
“wacky tobacky” that prosecu-
tors sought to punish. For the
love of her family, she supplied
marijuana" to her 49 year-old
son suffering‘ from multiple
sclerosis. Smoking marijuana, to
everyone’s delight, increased

her son’s appetite easing his tor-
ment.

Although she is on probation
as of last week, she insists that
she will do what it takes to help
her son. Reading her story in
The New Yorle Times, I just
could not help thinking that the

justice system will spend thou- ‘

sands of dollars prosecuting
Kaitz, branding her a “crimi-
nal”—why couldn’t they just
leave this woman alone?

Peter McW'illiams asks these

same questions in his new

‘His objections to consensual

book, Ain’t Nobocifyfs Business If crimes are grounded in classical

dumb.

For McWilliams, a consensual
crime is “any activity—currently
illegal-—in which we, as adults
choose to participate that does
not physically harm the person
or property of another.”

although his critique is not a
new one; Az'n’t Nobodj/’s
Business is entertaining if not all
that original.

What is more surprising than
the libertarianireasoning is his
economic calculus for consen-
sual crimes. Each year, state and
federal government agencies
spend $29 billion to catch, pros-
ecute and incarcerate drug pos-
sessors, users, traffickers and
manufacturers. Other agencies
spend billions of dollars in rela-
tion to foreign aid and military
adventures thwarting drug
usage.

And Ain’t Nobodyis Business
is not just a rallying call to
decriminalize drugs. The United
States military spent $500 mil-
lion to rid itself of gay and les-
bian. personnel in the 1980s.
Prosecuting prostitutes and ille-
gal gamblers, adds billions of
dollars of expenditures to the

Total cost for consensual
crime is equal to 50 billion dol-

 

lars each year, 350,000 people
are in jail right now and an
additional 1.5 million are on

Ain’t Nobody’s Business is an
enthralling look at the absurdity
of American’s schizoid public
policy. More importantly, it
actually highlights a common
reasoning not apparent in most
political debates today. It is also
a perfect holiday gift for that lib-

Take the song I Be Blowin’,

jazz song, made for this album,
by Maceo Parker & the rest of
the JB Horns. There’s no rap to
it; it’s just straight up phat ass
jazz provided by one of the

THE P_l’IT NEWS, Thursday, October 21, 1993

Gere, Olin can’t save predictable pap Mr. Jones

Mr. jones

Directed by Mike Figgis
Written by Eric ,Roth and
Michael Cristofer

Starring Richard Gere and Lena
Olin

She’s a psychiatrist nursing a
broken heart. He’s a fast-talking

‘manic depressive that just needs

a little love. And they’re both
attractive. When they end. up
together, it should surprise no
one.

Mr. jones attempts to show
how society inappropriately
treats the mentally ill. But
instead of giving an authentic

portrait of the problem or offer-
ing a genuine solution to it, the
movie insults the mental-health
system and uses it as the back-
ground for a predictable
romance. We’re left with the
cliche that love makes every-
thing better.

If female psychiatrists come

I close to resembling Libbie (Lena

Olin), then Clinton’s health-care
plan needs more work than
they realize. As she watches
video taped interviews with her
patients, Libby looks more like
a shocked voyeur than a profes-
sional doctor. While she seems
to relate, to the patients, her

  
  

NEED SOMETHING

 

T DOES HOUSE

 

 

_ superior

(Anne Bancroft)
approaches them with assembly
line mentality: “Evaluate, med-
icate, vacate,” she says.

Enter Mr. Jones (Richard
Gere). A fast-talker with ESP
(for half the movie, at least), he
winds up in Libby’s care after
attempting to fly from a roof,
and later, after disrupting a sym-
phony concert. Instead of
examining him, upon their initial
meeting, Libby gazes at him
with a pitiful look in her eyes,
laying the groundwork for their
budding relationship.

Throughout the film, Libby’s
involvement with Mr. Jones is

anything but professional or
believable. One minute she tells
him to leave her alone, the next
he is riding in her car. Somehow
she gets into his apartment and
waits for him. And despite the
fact that she never learns his
name, they eventually spend
the night together, putting her
career in jeopardy. I
Mr. Jones wants to reinforce
that the mentally ill do not
receive appropriate treatment.
But the movie states its argu-
ment by showing a health sys-
tem run by clueless idiots. Mr.
Jones babbles a few clever
statements to a judge during a

international band.

competency hearing and winds
up on the street again. Despite
Libby’s testimony of his symp-
toms, no one raises any objec-
tion.

For some reason, everyone
who meets Jones outside the
hospital gets taken in by his
manic eccentricity. He captures
the heart of Susan (Lisa
Malkiewicz), a dizzy, blonde
bankteller, when he closes his
$12,000 account, another unex-
plained element that doesn’t
quite fit. And construction
worker Howard (Delroy Lindo)
keeps in touch with him after
Jones disrupts the job with his
flying attempt. \

The plot of M7'.]O1’l€S predicts
itself so much, from Jones
upsetting a tray of medicine
held in front of him to the film’s
melodramatic final scene, that
by the end, it’s hard to care
whether or not Jones has been
rehabilitated.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 21, 1993

Diggin’

Continued from page S-5
But the track to keep an eye on
is Stone Age. On this joint, they
team up with Biz Markie &
drop rhymes to a chopped up
breakbeat with beatboxing (yes,
beatboxingll) over it. What’s so
great about this song is they let
you know that if high—tech sam-
ples don’t clear, they can rock
rhymes over a beatbox.

For half of this album, they
pay homage to the old school.
With guest cameos by Guru,
Busta Rhymes, Shortie No
Mass (newcomer from Philly),
& a few others, this album is
one to get open to. T h e
main beef I had with this album
is that they kept losing me.
They were never really direct &
to the point. Basically, I got
tired of chasing meanings. This
album was nothing at all like De
La Soul is Dead (which, in my
opinion, was their best album).
But like Posdnuos says in one
song:

‘ .  F"le being hard, Posdnuos

is complicated. 

I guess that’s the group’s theme.

It is a very good album; if
you’re a De La Soul fan, this
album is definitely for you. It’ll
never be another 3 Feet High
and Rising, but it’s definitely
worth peeping.

Before I listened to this
album, I had my reservations
about it; for the simple fact that,
except for their ep (This is an
EP. release), they’ve never
made anything that I could lis-
ten to all the way through. Just a
song here, a song there. But that
wasn’t the case with this album.
On this one, Digital
Underground takes a new
twist. Their music was always a.
combination of George Clinton
meets a half-way-serious Bobby
Jimmy. Now it’s George Clinton
meets a half-way-serious Bobby
Jimmy who then runs into
Grover Washington, Jr.

The fusion of funk & jazz is all
that. It comes out extremely
well on The Return Of the
Crazy One. The phat ass jazz
bass & piano with a familiar
funk sample (Aqua Boogie) & a
drumtrack that they’ve used
before (Sing A Simple Song by
Sly G The Family Stone), makes
for a hellified crazy mad addic-
tive ass beat. Wussup Wit The

Love (not a typo!) discusses the
very serious issues of ‘dornestic
violence (black on black, white
on black, cops on blacks). Over
a very somber track, Shock G,
Mony B, 2Pac & some new kid
(I don’t know his name) give
this song the attitude. Bran Nu
Swetta talks about girls &
groupies “sweatin”’ them. The
wild card on this album has to
be Jerkit Circus. This is a silly
ass song that talks about the
safest sex in the world... mastur-
bation. -

What can you expect from a
song who’s chorus goes:

 ’jerle—it circus’, put it in
your palm <9 you don’t need a
condom. ”

Overall, the album is phat,
but it’s some of the fast: forward
material that keeps it back.
Other than those few songs, it’s
all that. The D-ﬂo is definitely in
effect. Myself, I’m dyin’ to see
who wins the Humpty Dance

down here in the real world. Jack gets
bored with his Halloweenly duties and
develops a. mid—life crisis that lingers
until he stumbles upon Christmastown
and_decides to take over’ the duties of
Santa Claus with the help of Sally
(Catherine O’Hara), a rag doll and his
secret admirer, and the rest of
I-Ialloweentown. Unfortunately,
the well-meaning Jack can’t even make a
paper snowﬂake that doesn’t turn out
like a spideiweb and ends up filling the
hopeful kids stockings with the monsters
under the bed.

For all the visual splendiferousness of
the movie, the rest of the parts are disap-
pointingly lacking. Other than Jack and
the duck~like, wheelchair— bound, evil
scientist who lords over Sally with a sin-
ister whimsy that _has somewhat adult

implications, the characters are unim~.

pressive. Each creature has his or her
own particular gimmick, whether it’s
detachable limbs or a revolving two-
faced head. Beyond this, however,
Burton strives to endow them with a
charm that comes across as decisively
undead. Nowhere is this more evident
than in the character of Oogie Boogie

Danny Elfman’s musical score, is ade-
quate, but his song lyrics give little
insight into the characters and aren’t
nearly as clever as the typical Disney that
Burton rebelled against in the early
eighties. However, Elfman sings the part
of Jack Skellington and gives him a soul
through his balefully yearning Voice.
And, although Burton’s ideas are mod-
erately witty, they never approach the
unique. Using the holidays as a jumping-
off point is way too convenient. They are

Panthers to face scrambling ‘Snake in annual ‘Backyard Brawl’

By Jason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

I You ever heard of picking on
someone your own size? A ’
The Backyard Brawl — West

Virginia and Pitt’s annual‘

slugfest — has, in the past cou-
ple of years, turned into what
can be likened to a 13-year-old
bully picking on a nine-year-
old computer nerd, with West
Virginia vaulting into the unde-

. niable lead in talent and facili-

ties in this storied rivalry.
True, it’s not Johnny Majors’
fault and he has had to deal

with it all season, but when it.

gets down to bare essentials,
these two teams enter the
series’ 86th contest on two dif-
ferent planes. _

West Virginia enters the
game with a week’s rest, hav-
ing scheduled a bye week to
precede the yearly contest with
Pitt. .

The USA Today/Cable News
Network’s 15th-ranked squad is
poised to crack the Top 10 in
the country for the first time
since 1989, when they lost to
Notre Dame in a Fiesta Bowl
blowout.

“This is a team with much
experience, a team with a lot of
good speed,” Majors said.

The Mountaineers entertain
the Panthers having several siz-
able advantages:

-Mike Logan — WVU’s»-all-

ing corps -— always strong at
Mountaineer Field —— for WVU.
But where the Mountaineers

are the most’ dangerous is just‘

where Pitt is the most Vulnera-
ble -—- on the attack.

Offensively, the Mountaineers
plow into opposing D’s with a
pound-it-down-your—throat atti-
tude: blast between the tackles,
then hit you with a scrambling,
tricky quarterback.

“People say that all we do is
run up the middle but I think

. we’re a little better than that,”

Nehlen said. .

“They are a power football
team... they’re very physical
and they have diversity,” Pitt
defensive co—ordinator Chuck
Dreisbach said.

“They run some offense to
keep you honest and they run
some wide sweeps and
between the tackles.”

Like Virginia Tech’s Maurice
Deshazo and Syracuse’s Marvin
Graves — Pitt opponents who
had huge gamesagainst the
Panthers this season e quarter-
back Jake “The. Snake”
Kelchner augments a strong
arm with a couple of feet capa-
ble of getting him out of a lot
of tough situations.

“[Kelchner’sl very comparable
to the quarterbacks we’ve
already seen,” Dreisbach said.
“Usually when you’re playing
Top 20 teams, there are very
few teams in the top 20 that
don’t have a great quarterback.
They are all great athletes...
they have the ability to direct
offense and throw very well
and when the field is not open
they can pull the ball down
and run, but [Kelchner] may be
the best of them.”

Kelchner is complemented in

the backfield by leading rusher.
Robert Walker,_who has started
only one game but leads the
team with 402 total rushing

yards, He also leads the team .
in touchdowns, having notched

four so far this season.

Mike Baker and Jay Kearney, ,

a pair of seniors, provide WVU
with a couple of deep threats.
Baker averages three receptions
and 45.4 yards per game, while
Kearney is tied with Walker
with four touchdowns.

But regardless ofthe differ-
ence in talent and strength of
programs, the two teams will
meet on the field as they do
ever year —— bitter, mean and

A probably frothing at the mouth.

“I think it’s a great rivalry, I
truly do,” Majors said. “It was
truly exciting to be part of it
[before leaving Pitt], full of
electricity and anticipation.”

ing that they’re superior teams,

their kids don’t get into the

some things and get them

John knew what he was get-
ting into. I_talked to himlbefore
he took the job. He asked a lot

1’ of questions about Western

Pennsylvania — “do we still

' raise football players here? The"

steel industry. How about it
going away? Has it diminished
the talent of football?” He

- talked about boosters — “who

followed the club?” And one of

. the things he said was “Bill, I

only saw Pitt play once last

year -— it was on television on
a Thursday night against
Rutgers. I thought that game set
football back‘25 years.” He
knew basically what he was
getting into.

PN: For what you know of
coach Majors’ ability ———- having
seen it happen 20 years ago
and knowing him — and
knowing the NCAA regulations
from number of recruits, can
you estimate when this thing
can get turned around? Can
you put your thumb on a
timetable?

— I have to ask you what you
mean. ,

BH: Winning season? I think
to ask for one in ‘94 would be
too soon. Maybe ‘95. And cer-

year, this thing will be well on
its way.

In the third year, they’re
going to need some breaks.
Let’s face it: because of the
diminishing numbers of schol-
arships, and therefore the talent
level being thinner for every- '
body —— except maybe Notre
Dame and Penn State and a _
few others -— I think that it’s .
hard to predict.

National championship? You
could never do what [Majors]-
did in 1973 through 1976. He
did that with numbers, sheer
numbers. He knew that by
bringing in 83 freshmen that
he’d probably have 40_senior
football players. Show me as
team that has 40 seniors and I’ll
show you a team that has a
good chance of winning. Those
days are gone.

He learned from history, by
the way. He was playing for
Bob Wyatt at Tennessee. When
John was a freshmen, I do
believe there were something
like 100 to 110 freshmen. When
they were seniors they were
undefeated going into the bowl
game -— which they lost.

John knew what numbers
could do. Now, you can’t do
the numbers.

PN: I’ve heard you a couple '

of times on Lynn Cullen’s show
[on WIAE—1250AM], where
she’d have you on for an hour
just to tell stories and jokes.
Would you have [a story] that
says something about what you
think of coach Majors? You’ve
known him at Pitt and around
longer than most other people A
— as a friend and also as
someone closely associated
with Pitt. A -

BH: John Majors knows the
value of ‘people to his program.
No matter how big the role,
how small the role --John
knows how to say thank you.‘
And he sincerely means it.

I’m a broadcaster, I get paid
by WTAE to broadcast the
games. I am not paid by the
University of Pittsburgh. And so
in 1976 all I didlwas broadcast
12  actually 11 delightful
football games, because we
weren’t allowed to do the game
— the networks had that all
tied up. Anyhow, all I did was
broadcast a perfect season. I
did my job. John and the staff
did a terrific job in the bowl
game, despite the fact that -they
were gone to Tennessee after
the game  and we parted as
good friends.

The following summer, I was

North Carolina and I had an
extra week at the end of the
vacation. I said “let me call
John and see if I could swing
over to Knoxville and bring the
family.” Our kids knew their
kids — let’s see if we could
visit. “Sure, come on over,”
[Majors said], “you’re staying at
our house.” So we stayed at the
Majors’ house in Knoxville.
One day we played golf. And
he and I are on a cart going up
this hill on this one hole at
Cherokee Hills. He stopped the

. cart, looked me in the eye, and

said “Bill, I don’t know
whether I should be here or be
in Pittsburgh.” And then all of a
sudden, he hit the gas — I
never answered, he never
asked for a response. That told
me that he really and truly was

in a quandary as to whether he ‘

should have left or not.

Ithink why he left — I’m
only speculating — but I sus-
pect that as he built this thing
at Pitt  the people of
Tennessee called John home. It
gotto a point where John
wanted to be able to say to Pitt
“Hey, look what I got here.
Now what are you going to do
to keep me?” It got so good at
Tennessee that he had to go
back home. And boom — he
made the decision. I don’t
think his wife wanted to leave.
I think his daddy told him [that]
it’s tough to go home. But he
went anyhow. And he did a
heck of a job down there.

Anyhow, the story. One
night, were at the house and
he brought over some of the
coaches I knew well. I’m drink-
ing a tall gin-and-tonic and
John says to me “where’s your
ring?” I said “I didn’t get a ring
— I didn’t expect a ring. I
didn’t throw a block or make a
tackle.” Exactly one month to
the day, I was called into the
athletic director’s office at Pitt
.. . and handed this national
championship ring. It came
with a comment: “We’re sorly
for the oversight.”

I immediately knew who
wanted me to have the ring.
The fact that he was gone and I
was nolonger a part of his life,
of his career —- it didn’t matter.
He was saying thanks. His _
players, his coaches — they get
that same feeling.

PN: I want to talk a little
more about how Pitt football
got to this situation. Why didn’t
Paul Hackett succeed at Pitt?

BH: Paul Hackett didn’t suc-
ceed because Paul Hackett is
basically not a college football
coach. Paul Hackett is as good
an offensive coach as you’ll
find. Paul Hackett, in recent
years, has done it the pro way
—— where X’s and 05 mean
much more than at the college
level. In college, you have to
be motivational and certainly
you have to recruit. If Paul
I-Iackett failed, those were the
two areas — especially in the
recruiting area...

I tell you this about Paul: I
respect him as a football coach,

and I think that he may make

the difference in Kansas City. It
wouldh’t surprise me if that’s

the club that goes to the Super
Bowl.

PN: The state of the program,
1992  compared to prior to
his first time here. \Which team
was worse?

BH: December of ‘92?
Compared to the last time he
got here? I'll answer that very
simply. How many draft picks ~
did Pitt send to the pros last
year?

PN: Van Pelt I think was the
only guy. Wasn’t Vernon Lewis
a free agent?

BH: I don’t remember any-
body else [save Van Pelt] being
picked. *

When John took over in 1972
— let"s back it up to "71. It’s
still valid. We were in New
Orleans to play Tulane. They
beat us 44-8 or something like

_ that — it was a pretty good

butt—kicking. And I saw a per-
sonnel director from one of the
pro clubs. I asked him "Jim,
how many people are you here
to see?" He said: “about a
dozen." I said "what’s the
breakdown?" He says "nine Pitt
kids and three Tulane kids."
This was in ‘71 when we were
3-8. ‘72 we were 1-10. He’s
looking at nine Pitt kids ._..__
three Tulane kids.

That told me all I needed to
know.  

We liad some nplayersrhere.
They,needed better coaching,
better discipline, better condi-
tioning —John took care of L
that right away. -

There is no,comparisor1;._This,..‘

year is worse. . . — - ’ 

PN: In your year’s as a
broadcaster‘ and even following
them prior-.-_to that — i_s_this the
worst Pitt footba-l.l team that
you’ve seen? V _ q 1.

BH: No. I think the Dave
I-Iart teams were worse.

PN: Now that’s the late-mid-
’(i(‘)’s? .

BH: Yeah. Nobody’s asked
anybody to run the clock. I
remember Notre Dame-Pitt —
they ran the clocks through
timeouts and everything. No

.out—of-bounds plays — by

agreement — let’s get it over
with asquickly as possible.
That was worse. That was
before the commitment was
made by the administration to
put money into it. _

PN: Now your side —» ._
enough of the Pitt stuff. How
did you get into broadcasting?

BH: Almost by accident. My
dad was always involved in
electronics  he was an elec-
trician. I had an aunt who was
a nun who had a friend who
was a sister of charity, and she
had the Pittsbr'rrgh Diocesan
Radio and TV school. She
asked if I wanted to go and I
said “sure, I’ll do what my dad
does.” And I showed up and
the nun handed me a script to
read. I read the script and she-
said “you’re exactly what I’m
looking for.” I said “what’s
that?” She said “I need a 15-
year old brat to play the part in

_' a weekly radio thing. I didn-’t

need a script -— I was a brat.
I always wanted to be a

major league baseball player,

but I realized I wasn’t big

enough, strong enough, fast
enough. I went to this
radio/TV school and did some
on-air work — live on-air
work. Volunteered at WQED
pullingcables, throwing cues.
Then I went to Duquesne
where they have an on-air situ-
ation.

I was fortunate enough to do
some high school football and
Duquesne basketball

T hat’s where I got my back-
ground.

I got a job at WJKF — I did
news, I did PR. But they didn’t
do sports. When I got to ‘TAE,
I was a disc jockey and it was
heavy on scores. That’s where I
gotto the point of “hey, he
knows what he’s talking
about.” Finally in 1969, the
boss asked if I had done play-
by-play. I said yes. WTAE had
a chance to get Pitt football
away from \Y/“WSW and, in 1
order to get it, they wanted us
to take basketball as well. Ed —
Conway would do the football
and I’d help him  and I did
basketball.

Then in 1974, the boss said
“you're too busy wearing two
hats” —— I was still a disc jock-
ey.

I took the sports hat.
Fortunately it’s worked out.

PN:You said you grew up
wanting to be a baseball play-
er. Did that ever come into the
play, in terms of broadcasting?

BH: I always wanted to do

_ baseball. I loved the Pirates

and always thought I could do
it well.

But I don’t ever take the road
not taken. -

If the Pirates would come
calling now, I’d have to sit and
think about it. Then I’d think
“wait a minute. Can’t travel
with John Sauer. Can’t travel
with Dick Groat. My passion is
with Pitt. My son is a Pitt grad."
It would be a very hard deci-
sion at this point in my career.

When I first got in that Pitt
Stadium booth, I said “if I’m
lucky enough to be here for 20
years, I will consider my career

‘a great success.”

I’m starting my 25th of bas-
ketball and I’m in the midst of
my 20th in football  and I
have no regrets.

PN: Where do you see your-
self in ten years? Flying around
following Pitt?

BH: If Pitt will have me and
‘TAE is still involved and I‘m
still under contract with this
station —— definitely  enjoying
every minute of it. If not,
maybe I’ll start thinkinggof ‘ g

semi~retirement. Somebody
might say “hey, he’d make a
good fundraiser!”

PN: You know a couple of
‘people (laugh).

BH: (Laugh) I sure do.

You know, I do have one
regret. I didn’t take notes  so
I can't write a book. If I did
write a book, one of the great
stories was the ‘81 Sugar Bowl,
I remember distinctly ‘Sal
Sunseri —— when we got into
scoring position — told Jackie
lSherril1] “coach, 1et’s kick the
field goal, tie the thing, and get
the hell out of here  and go
down to Bourbon Street.” [Dan]
Marino took the Gatorade bot-
tle from his mouth and says
“coach, give me the football
and I’ll win the game.” Guess
which decision was made and
guess what happened? Marino

hit John Brown with a bullet.

. I’ll never forget that as long as I

live.

PN: Anything else?

BH: Maybe I’m going out on
a limb here, but I know there
were some Pitt people who
wanted Jackie to come back.
Jackie, no question in my
mind, would’ve got the job
done as well. ’

But when I see how it has
slipped, in terms of what needs
healed here — alumni, corpo-
rate, administration, commit-
ment, monies — there is no
greater person who could have
been hiredthan John Majors.
