new cafeteria

service this week

Rebecca N. Jones

 

Responses to a customer survey about campus cafeterias
will ﬁnally be put to work this week, as administrators use them
to judge the ﬁnal three vendors vying for Pitt’s food services
contract.

According to Eli Shorak, the leader of the negotiating com-
mittee, other criteria that must be met are quality issues, cost
and ﬁnancial issues, and how the vendor can improve the Roy
Roger’s eatery in the Cathedral of Learning.

He said vendors will also have to conform to one possible

change in the “block” dining plan. According to Shorak,
administrators are considering combining the “block” program
with “dining dollars” to alleviate one of students’ biggest com-
plaints. , “ ,
Many students complained that change was not returned
for purchases under the $4.50 block amount. By combining the
two, any change left over from such a purchase would auto-
matically be added onto the student’s dining dollars account.

Shorak also ‘said he could not release the names of the ven-
dors or what their proposals entailed, due to conﬁdentiality rea-
sons. He said that by releasing such information, the competi-
tion would be jeopardized.

“We don’t want to release the names because we want to
keep the negotiations as competitive as possible. This way we
know that we are providing the University with the best and
most creative food supplier,” said Shorak. '

He would not say whether Marriott is one of the ﬁnal con-
tenders or not. it

Shorak did say student opinion was one of the more impor-
tant factors the committee would consider. That’s good news
for students, who claim their sentiments have been ignored in
the past.

“One of the most important aspects is providing quality
food service to cafeteria customers,” said Shorak. “Especially
quality service to students, since they use the eateries every
day.”

Administrators said they are happy with the way negotia-
tions are proceeding.

“We had very interesting bids, and I am very pleased with
what I have read so far,” said Betsy Sallade-Farina, Pitt’s direc-
tor of food services. V

Sallade-Farina said she believes bidders carefully consid-
ered examples of what students really want from their food
providers taken from infomiation provided by the Student
Government Board.

The SGB conducted the student end of the survey that
administrators are using to judge the applicants.

Neither Sallade-Farina nor Shorak would elaborate on
what the student survey entailed because neither know who
currently has the ﬁle.

Retirement plan still ages away  

Eligible retirees holding on to reap benefits

After months of haggling over the
terms of a retirement incentive pack-
age, an ad hoc committee of faculty
members and administrators still
aren’t close to reaching an agreement.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
appointed the committee in January to
come up with a plan to encourage
older, tenured faculty members to
retire so they can be replaced by
younger, lower-paid faculty.

In the meantime, though, several
hundred professors who are eligible
for retirement remain on the universi-
ty’s payroll, waiting to see what kind
of a deal they might get. '

“There are a lot of people who are
hanging around waiting for this to
come through, hoping for a big pay-
out,” said Professor Keith McDuffie,
outgoing president of the University
Senate and a member of the faculty
retirement incentive committee.

In the last year, only ﬁve of nearly
300 eligible faculty members opted to
retire, according to McDuffie.

Usually, about 100 professors
retire each year, he added.

If each of those professors who
didn’t retire earned the average of
$60,000 annually, it’s costing Pitt as

 

much about $6 million dollars to keep
them on the payroll while the ad hoc
committee tries to come up with a
retirement deal that everybody likes.

“A normal retirement situation‘

would have paid for salary increases
this year,” said Professor Richard
Pratt, chair of the Senate budget poli-
cies committee.

Most faculty members favor a
plan which would offer cash bonuses
of up to two and a half times a tenured
professor’s annual salary if they retire
within the next three years.

The Faculty Assembly approved a
draft of the plan at yesterday’s meet-
mg.

However, Pitt’s chief ﬁscal ofﬁ-
cer, who chairs the ad hoc committee,
expressed doubts about the viability of
such a plan. .

“It is my job to look at things and
ask if they are affordable,” Art
Rarnicone said in an interview. “I con-
tinue to have concerns about the
affordability of this plan.”

Rarnicone is not the only one with
questions.

“How is this going to be paid for?”
asked Professor Mark Ginsburg, of the
School of Education. “Is it going to
come from departmental budgets?”

Pennsylvania legislators
consider hike in sales tax

Statelegislators want to raise local sales
and hotel taxes to fund new and improved
stadiums and a convention center that they
say would make the city more attractive to
businesses and tourists.

On Thursday, Pennsylvania legislative
oﬂicials revealed efforts to get a referendum
on the November ballot for a 0.5 percent
sales tax increase and a 2 percent hotel tax
increase in Allegheny County.

The proposed sales tax hike will also be
considered for nine surrounding counties,
including Armstrong, Beaver, Butler,
Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence,

7 Washington and Westmoreland counties.»

Allegheny County currently has a 1 per-
cent sales tax, in addition to the statewide
sales tax of 6 percent. The proposed hike,
then, would boost the county’s sales tax to
7.5 percent.

If passed in’ every county, Allegheny
County would receive over $114 million
armually for industrial sites, transportation
improvements and cultural and tourism
attractions. ,

Bob Kline, the executive director for the
Pennsylvania House’s local government
committee, said the proposal is a “relatively
fair tax” because it would only be placed on
luxury items. Food and necessary clothing
would not be taxed.

State Representative Terry Van Horne
announced the proposal of House Bill 16()0
— the Regional Renaissance Initiative Act
— at a New Kensington press conference last
Thursday.

“We can make investments we need to
spark new growth and create jobs in Western
Pennsylvania,” said Van Home in a prepared
statement. He added that this money would

be used speciﬁcally to improve the region’s .

road, water and sewer’ systems; and clean up
old waste sites to make room for new hous-
ing and commercial areas.

House
Bill
1600

  

 

f      to

 

Ifpassed, the bill will permit residents of

the 10 counties to vote on whether to raise the '

taxes this fall. If approved, the increase

-would begin on July 1, 1998, and last for

eight years.

Hotel Tax

- Another part of the bill will automatical-
ly increase Allegheny_County’s hotel tax by 2
percent beginning Sept. 1, 1997, with the
potential to drop 0.5 percent next year, if the
sales tax increase is passed.

The money raised by the new hotel tax
would go toward nearly tripling the size of
the David Lawrence Convention Center.‘

If the sales tax is approved by voters, the
hotel tax will be lowered to 1.5 percent next
July.

Legislators say that building a bigger

' convention center will bring jobs and sales to

downtown merchants, hotels and restaurants.

Ifthe tax passes in Allegheny County, the
revenue would be split into two parts, with 75
percent going into a “Regional Destination
Facilities Fund,” which pays for projects based
in Pittsburgh. "lire other 25 percent would go
into a “Regional Growth Fund,” which would
pay for projects outside of the city, but 
the boundaries of Allegheny County. '

Ifitpassesinanyoralloftlreothernine
counties, 25 percent of the money raised
would go to Pittsburgh because legislators say
the area counties beneﬁt ﬁom being so near the
city.

The county would keep 75 percent for
their own projects. (See graph.)

The Cil/s Cut

Kline explained that the destination facil-
ities fund would be used for projects located
within the city of Pittsburgh. This part of the
bill has received the most criticism from tax-
payers as a “stadium tax.”

The legislative summary of the bill ear-

marks this money for four areas of Pittsburgh
improvements:

0 Thirty to 40 percent of the total funds to
be used for the expansion of the David L.
Lawrence Convention Center —— hence, the
lowering of the hotel tax to 1.5 percent if the

sales tax passes. Officials say lowering the
tax will make it cheaper for ‘convention-goers
to stay in hotels and encourage them to come
back.

0 Twenty-eight to 32 percent of the money
will be used for the construction of a new
major league ballpark in Pittsburgh.

0 Twenty-eight to 32 percent of the total
funds will be used for the construction/renova-
tion of a major league football stadium in
Pittsburgh.

Either a renovation to the current Three
Rivers Stadium or construction of an all-new
stadium in Pittsburgh’s North Side would be
made with this percentage of the destination
facilities tax.

0 Five to 10 percent ofthe total funds will
be used for the construction of parks, parking
facilities and theaters in the Pittsburgh Cultural
District

Representative Jane One said she thinks
this part of the tax is fair to everyone in every
county, despite the fact that so much money
from other counties goes directly to Allegheny
County. -

Allegheny County will not be required to
give any portion of its tax revenue to any other
county.

_ “Everyone in this region beneﬁts from the
regional attractions in Pittsburgh as wellas the
amenities in their own county,” said Orie, “and
this plan provides that everyone would share in
the costs of preserving and improving them.”

Regiond Growth Fund Cut

But the money in the regional growth
fund would stay in the county where it was
raised and be used for one of four particular

uses, according to the summary:

0 Industrial site development

- Cultural, recreational, historical and
entertainment facilities

0 Transportation projects “that will assist
in attracting and retaining jobs” —— including
highways, bridges, airports, ports, and rail lines

0 Revolving funds to assist the expansion
of businesses into the region. Not more than 20
percent of a region’s funding would be used
for this purpose.

A board, called the Regional Renaissance
Authority, would be created to oversee the
spending of the two ftmds for all counties
involved. 4

“It’s basically going to be a citizens
board,” said Kline, who added that the rr1em—
bership should eﬂ°ectively represent the coun-
ties from which they are chosen.

Aleged '

Kline added that only the counties
approving the proposal this November would
beneﬁt from the money raised.

He added that: “It is vital that it [the refer-
endum if on the ballot] gets passed in
Allegheny.” If Allegheny ‘County were to
reject the sales tax increase, the “regional des-
tinations fund” would be eliminated, and the
approving counties would use the money they
raise from the tax hike for growth ﬁmd pur-

e biggest misconception that people
have is that this is a stadium tax,” said Kline.
"That is not the case. It is a regional develop-
ment 

But Kline said he thinks it’s too early to
wony about the sales tax increase because it
still has to pass the Pemisylvania General
Assembly before it breaks for the summer.

“There’s enough support to get it through
the General Assembly,” said Kline. But he
added the proposals on the referendum are
“very sketchy, very premature, because if this
doesn’t get passed, they [the proposals] all go
by the wayside.”

Spy may get lighter prison sentence

PITTSBURGH — Jury selection continued
yesterday for the trial of the Pittsburgh man
accused of dragging a police ofﬁcer from a car
for almost a mile.

Nine jurors have been picked to hear the
case of James Mitchell Jr. Mitchell is charged
with attempted homicide, aggravated assault
and related charges for the incident, which
happened last June.

DENVER —— Arguments are scheduled to
begin today on whether or not Timothy
McVeigh should be executed for the

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Federal prosecutors
are recommending that the highest—ranking
CIA ofﬁcer ever convicted of being a spy be
given a lighter sentence than the maximum life
term.
The cooperation that Harold Nicholson

has given the government may help him to get ‘

a reduced sentence. Federal prosecutors are
recommending that Nicholson be sentenced to
less than 24 years rather than the maximum
sentence of life in prison. Nicholson has admit-
ted to selling government documents to
Russian officials for $300,000.

The former CIA officer is scheduled to be
sentenced on Thursday.

Author reads writings to free convicted killer

ean Marie Zelt

 

Convinced of civil injustice towards
Mumia Abu-Jamal, author Alice Walker
encouraged an audience of students, faculty
and Pittsburgh residents to join in her ﬁght
for his freedom Wednesday evening.

Walker is the Pulitzer Prize winning
author of The Color Purple, numerous other
books and collections of poetry. Now
nationally promoting a new book, Walker
speaks in support of Abu-Jamal in each city
she visits.

VVrth a hall full of believers, the atrnos-
phere at Wednesday’s gathering was similar
to a church service. Supporters even passed
around a collection plate for Abu-Jarnal,
who is accused of murdering a Philadelphia
police ofﬁcer nearly 16 years ago.

Walker said her appearance in support
ofAbu-Jamal is an attempt to spread aware-
ness of “an abomination of justice.”

But controversy rages around Walker’s
opinionin acase thathas attractedinterna-
tional attention for over a decade.

At 4 am on December 9, 1981, Abu-
Jamal, an outspoken Aﬁican-American
radio journalist who was moonlighting as a
Philadelphia cab driver, Abu-Jarnal says he
saw his brother struggling with police oﬂi-
cer, Daniel Faulkner.

Abu-Jarnal says he stopped to help his
brother.

Some students have said that in order
to supply the best vendor, Pitt should
break ties with Marriott as soon as possi-
ble.

“The food is disgusting, and it cer-
tainly isn’t worth what you pay for it,”
said Zalika Sapp-Weaver, a senior at Pitt.
“No one could force me to eat the food the
cafeteria supplies.”

Another student, Evelyn Graeff, said
one reason she moved oﬁ-campus was
because she didn’t want to eat in the Pitt
cafeterias another year.

Shorak said he is very aware of how
students feel on the subject.

“Betsy [Sallade-Farina] ﬁelds con-
cerns just like this daily_,” he said.
“Marriott hears complaints like this every
day also. They are aware of the feelings
and want to address the concerns. They
know that if they are to remain the incurn—
bent, they must address student input.”

While some may feel that Sapp-
Weaver and Graeff’s opinions on Marriott
is the general consensus around campus,

a Shorak disagrees.

“Not every student feels this way,” he
said. “We also don’t want anyone to feel
that there is any bias against Marriott
going into these negotiations.

“There have been no biases at all in
this search,” he continued. “I was chosen
to lead this committee because I have no
aﬁiliation to the vendors or to food ser-
vices. I’m unbiased. I’m neutral. I just like
good food.”

make ﬁnancial sense to the university,
he adds.

What happens if the committee
fails to reach an agreement?

“That’s the million dollar ques-
tion,” said Ramicone. “It is possible.”

In that case, the administration does
not have to offer any incentives, he
said.

“Oh, I think we’ll bring this to clo-
sure soon,” he added. “The university
has to make a decision one way or the
other.”

  Get rid of the teachers,
then shut down the school!

Pitt’s administration wants to remove tenured faculty via attrition
and, presumably, to replace them with low—paid graduate teaching assis-
tants in order to cut costs. This is silly.

They should just ﬁre everybody.

Considering how much students pay to go to Pitt, cutting costs is a
good idea. We’d all like to get ourdegrees for about $10, andwe’ve devel-
oped a four-year plan to make that possible.

0 First year. We may not legally be able to ﬁre all the professors, but
it should be just as cost-effective to have them all “eliminated” (if you
know what we mean), and Pitt could get away with it. Pitt is a faceless
organization, and you can’t put a faceless organization in a line-up. This
will save even more money than giving them ﬂamboyant retirement
packages, and Pitt can take the lead in the movement to overturn the
tenure system.

Then people would learn not to rrress with the university. They’d
know Pitt means business.

Atthesametime,wecantumthesportsteamsovertograduate
coaching assistants. Pitt’s football team should be playing pick—up games
against CMU’s team anyway, and they don’t need coaches for that.

0 Second year: By now, all of our sports programs will be in the gut-
ter, and nobody good will want to play here, so we won’t need coaching
assistants anymore. But we can let anybody who wants to play for the
teams do so.

Also, this would be a good time to tum Bigelow Boulevard into a toll
road and make some more money. Leave it four lanes wide ——- money is
money.

0 Third year“. After two years of teaching eight 300-student classes per
day, grad students will want to leave. There will ﬁnally be no opposition
the the FAS downsizing the administration wants. Students can meet for
discussion groups whenever they please, and assign their own grades,
which should teach them some responsibility and self—reliance.

We can also start selling Pitt’s buildings to UPMC so it can tum them
into parking lots.

0 Fourth year: Turn Pitt into a correspondence school. 
overhead by having all students send their grades (not assignments, just
grades) directly to Mark Nordenberg’s house, along with a $10 check for
the production cost of a diploma. The chancellor can then send the diplo-
ma, with his signature, and everybody is happy.

This plan will cut costs to a minimum while providing the most “lib-
eral” of educations in the history of hire -— er, higher learning.

It just goes to show that you not only don’t need competent, experi-
enced teachers to have a university, but you also don’t even need the uni-
veisity.

Signs point to end of the world

 

The world is coming to an
end A couple of months ago, one
of those National Enquirer-like
rags written for and by yahoos
declared that the world was com-
ing to an end Personally, I thought .
that it was full of crap, but appar-
ently I was wrong.

Now, I am not a yahoo. At
1east,Idon’tthinkIam, andofall
the colorful names .I’ve ever been
called, ‘yahoo” is not one of them.
However, many things have been
drawn to my attention lately that
lead me to think thatthe yahoos
just might be right

First of all, I’ve nearly gradu-
ated I only have one stinking class

to higher an Opinions Goddess
Emeritus, the world is deﬁnitely in
trouble. The fact that I have yet to
win the lottery also does not bode
well for civilization.

Now, that may seem like more
than enough angst for one person
to deal with, but it gets worse. Bob
Dylan is in the hospital. Some say
that he’s krrockin’ on heaven’s
door, and others say not to think
twice because he’s all right. But I
don’t know. When the prophets

Students weren’t always apathetic

For years, I have wondered why the Pitt
student body is so strange concerning the
support of its athletic programs. At most
large universities, student support is the one
thing that has been, and always will remain,
a constant.

At Pitt ﬂrough, the opposite is true.
Students tend to shy away ﬁom the tumstiles
at athletic events unless the situation is
absolutely perfect; an undefeated record, 70-
degree weather, a giveaway day; throw in a
free hotdog, with a shuttle bus up cardiac
hill, and maybe we’re talking.

I know, I’ve heard them all: Pitt is a
commuter school. Pitt has too many gradu-
atestudents.'I‘hefootballteamisnotgood
It’s too cold out. I don’t like noon kickotfs —
I need to sleep more. I don’t feel like walk-
ing up the hill. Oakland at night, y’know.

Give me a break

WhenIwasaf1eshmanatPittin 1987,

these excuses weren’t used, the student sec-
tion at the old stadium was always packed,
and nobody complained Students crammed
every single parking lot in Oakland to tail-

gateforteamsthatwerebynomeansgreat;

And we had a lot offun.

Supporting the school’s football pro-
gram shows the nation how you take pride in
your own university, what you think of your
school and serves as a marketing tool for
more students, which translates into more
money and better facilities for all Pitt stu-
dents.

Think of it as maintaining a tradition of
Pittfootballthatisbothrichanddeep. Not
many schools can claim nine national cham-
pionships, or boast of graduating the greatest
quarterback in the NFL.

 nor is it a ”conspiracy theory.”

There are several characteristics that an
allegation must have to be called a conspira-
cy theory. It must draw conclusions that the
available evidence does not wanant. It also
must attribute an illogical motive and an
exaggerated degree of corruption and malice
to the conspirators.

The idea that Mumia was framed qual-
iﬁes as a conspiracy theory only if you
believe that the state never persecutes people
because of what they believe or who they are
and believe that the justice system is fair,
consistent and does not discriminate. You
can believe this only if you don’t have a
problem with the fact that the death rows and
prisons in general in the United States are
overwhelmingly populated by minorities
and poor. people.

Msnosky, believing that the movement
around Mumia Abu-Jamal’s case is based on

‘ a conspiracy theory, is a vivid demonstration

‘ 1

of how to err on the other end of the spec-
trum. If one extreme is paranoid suspicion,
the other is unquestioning acceptance and a
lack of skepticism about the explanations of
society and the versions of history we are
taught. His characterization of capitalists is a
good example —— “people who have spent
their lives working hard to make a better life
for their family.” If the average compensa-
tion of a CEO is more than 200 times the
average of a factory worker, are they just
working 200 times harder?

As for us engaging in uneducated
activism and having our hearts in the right
place without using our brains, the ISO chal-
lenges Marc Wisnosky to a public debate on
Murnia’s case, and we’ll see who the real
purveyors of rhetorical nonsense are.

Rock'n' Roll
Renaissance

As grunge quietly dies, a new crop
of rockers prove that the music is still
alive at the turn of the millennium

When that rarest
of creatures, an hon-
est—to—God lyrical
.. . ............ .. genius, bursts onto
the national music scene, it’s cause for celebra-
tion. Well, break out your party hats. Dan
Bem’s self—titled debut album establishes him
as THE poet of the post-gnmge era.

Despite their unmistakable ‘90s vibe,
Bem’s ironic songs of alienation owe more to
Bob Dylan than to Kurt Cobain. What distin-
guishes Bem from countless other “me and my
guitar’ ’ retro—beatnik wannabes is simple: He’s
not in the least bit pretentious. With sharp, ring-
ing guitar work that’s simultaneously friendly
and fresh, Bem rants like a musical Dennis
Miller, anguished over the world’s suffering,
but unable to express his pain without cracking
jokes every few seconds.

“Go to Sleep” pokes ﬁm at the homoge-
nization of life in our shopping—mall culture:
“If you wanna make some dough / you ought
to invest in my company / We’re putting bar
codes on the fetuses / using ultrasound and
laser technology / We used to do babies / but
some of them still got mixed up / This takes
care of that.”

The lead track on the album, “Jerusalem,”
evokes the tenuous feel of a relationship that’s
heartfelt, but is plagued by doubts: “Don’t ask
what kind of music I’m gonna play tonight /
Just stay a while, hear for yourself a while /
And if you must put me in a box, make sure it’s
a BIG box / with lots of windows / and a door
to walk through.”

“Marilyn,” the track that’s starting to hit
radio stations, suggests that Marilyn Monroe
should have married the racy author Henry
Miller rather than playwright Arthur Miller: “If
she did, he’d have taken her to Paris / If she
did, they’d have fucked every day / Then she
would have felt like a woman / not like a pic-
ture in a magazine.”

Despite his keen awareness of life’s insan-
ity, Bem is meful rather than bitter, happily
mocking himself without succumbing to self-
loathing. Why can’t everyone be so well-
adjusted and happy about their cynicism?
—-Stephen H. Segal

  

A musician who
covers both “Come
As You Are” and

 

 

“Amazing Grace” on the same album is bound
to be interesting at the very least.

Laura Love deﬁnes the title of her new
album, Octomon, as “of one—eightl1 African
ancestry” and describes her own music as
“Afro-Celtic.” This hybrid—ethnic style mixes

Aﬁican harmonies with Cajun accordion and.

good old—fashioned funky bass lines to pro-
duce a rich, bluesy rock sound that’s hard to
ignore.

Love is clearly ‘a passionate lover of the
sensuality of words and, on Octomon, spends
lots of time playing with their sounds rather
than their meanings. In “Capricorn and
Hominy,” Love rhymes like there’s no tomor-
row: “All uptight and in your face and I just
want to die / Sirnpering and without grace I
cannot wonder why / I am trembling I am
falling I am pitching high / Missing rudder, rot
and shudder, bungling ho—aye.” Meanwhile,
beneath the skipping prose an Irish ﬁddle
counterpoints a tribal chant.

“Simple” is an up-front, ﬁnger—snapping
R&B number, a woman trying to ignore her
own sentimentality long enough to tell her guy
to shape up or ship out: “Say it with ﬂowers,
say it with words / Say it with money, simple /
Say it with feeling, say it with love / Say it,
don’t spray it, simple.”

The aforementioned cover tunes are as
appealing as Love’s own songwriting.
“Amazing Grace” starts off as pure, traditional
a cappella hymnal before springing into zyde-
co revelry in the second verse; “Come As You
Are” is faithful in arrangement to the Nirvana
original, but stripped down, consisting of Love
alone on her bass guitar. Both songs highlight
what, in the end, is Love’s major strength as a
musician: the ability to take old, seemingly
tired sounds and craft them into something
wonderful.

—Stephen H. Segal

nate enough to see
the Ben Folds Five

Rock

and Ever Amen and hear for yourself.

The North Carolina trio (yes, there are
only three of them) is headed by piano man
Ben Folds, who draws on the legacies of key-
board masters like Jerry Lee Lewis and Randy
Newman to play songs that range from jubi-
lantly brash to quietly, heart-rendingly sad.

On the one hand, Folds pounds the ivories
for all he’s worth as he says the things we’d all
like to cut loose and say. In “One Angry Dwarf
and Two Hundred Solemn Faces,” he sneers at
the school kids who used to call him a nerd: “If
you really want to see me / check your papers
and the TV / Look who’s tellin’ who what to
do / Kiss my ass goodbye.”

On the other hand, he can lighten his
touch for a somber song like “Brick” about a
teenage couple facing an abortion: “I pace
around the parking lot / then I walk_ down to
buy her ﬂowers / and sell some gifts that I got
/ Can’t you see it’s not me you’re dying for/
Now she’s feeling more alone than she ever
has before.”

The piano’s predominance notwithstand-
ing, the Ben Folds Five isn’t instrumentally
tedious. Bassist Robert Sledge and drummer
Darren J essee both get their moments to shine,
and several tracks feature subtly powerful
suing orchestrations. Folds himself picks up a
melodica (a harmonica-like instrument with a
piano keyboard) to add a melancholy wail to
the ballad “Smoke.” Whatever and EverAmen
is a welcome reminder that rock music doesn’t
need a lead guitarist to knock your socks off.

—Stephen H. Segal

It’s seriously
unlikely that Moxy
Fruvous — a group
of Canadian weirdos
— is really in the Michigan Militia, no matter
what their song says. But tl1at’s not the point.
For an eclectic, lighthearted mix of ‘60s- and
‘70s—inﬂuenced, purely-for-fun pop, check out
the foursome’s You Will Go to the Moon, com-
bining the Beach Boys’ harmonization, riffs
from the Monkees and Jackson Five funk

The album kicks off with the hillbilly hip-
hop number “Michigan Militia,” sounding not
unlike a “Tennessee”—era Arrested
Development. The song pokes as much fun at
its subject through its silly banjo-and-drurn-
machine sound as it does through the lyrics;
you’d think that an agrarian compound should
contain vio1entMuppets rather than beer-bel-
lied militiamen. Look out —— Animal is polish-
ing his AK-47. .

Devoted BeeGees fans might be both
leery and excited to see that Fruvous covers
“I’ve Gotta Get a Message To You,” but fear
not —this version adds a whole new twist to
the song. Imagine the Jackson Five covering
the BeeGees: big hairAND bell bottoms. The
verses are song in a soft falsetto, with the
Jackson funk kicking in at the chorus. Close
your eyes, and you’H see little Michael with a
six-foot afro shimmying across the room.

The album takes on an Indian beat with
“Sahara” and “No No Raja.” “Sahara” has less
harmonizing than the rest of the album, mak-
ing for a nice change of pace; in fact, it sounds
like it could have been on the James album

laid. “No No Raja” is a bit more serious than
most of You Will Go to the Moon, as the singer‘
lusts after this woman from whom he is repeat-
edly warned to stay away.

For those of us who are bleeding heart lib-
erals, “Your New Boyfriend” is a blast “Well,
have you really changed that much since
school when any Nazi couldn’t swim in your
pool? You’ve just got to admit that your new
boyfriend’s a bit of a right—wing shit”

Moxy Fruvous might be slightly shiny
and happy, but every once in a while, the
gloomy guses of the world need to stop angst-

Pop radio has
recently been
increasingly full of
lighter, brighter
tunes — a great number of which are sung by
women. Fun as they are, these Prozac-pumped
performers, are plagued by one problem:
Despite catchy singles, very few of them are
putting out good albums.

And then there’s Grey Eye Glances. In a
word, wow. This New Jersey-based band,
whose name comes from the Edgar Allan Poe
poem ‘To One in Paradise,” has created a
unique blend of progressive and folk styles that
really works.

Vocalist Jennifer Nobel has a voice that is
easy on the ear and easy to understand; after
listening to the entire album, one isn’t tired of

her voice (as opposed to, say, Alanis Morisette, .

whose voice can grate after half a song). With
the inherent richness of a 12-string guitar to
accompany the vocals, the tracks maintain a
sense of continuous movement that is at times
playful and at times serious, but always
dynamic.

What really makes Eventide a cut above
the other she-rock on the market, however, are
the lyrics, similar in intensity to that of the
band’s literary inspiration, Poe, though less
morbid in subject matter. “Halfway Back” is
the most likely to be released to radio, and
seems especially appropriate for students at the
beginning of summer: “I was working my
weeks /meeting somebody else’s goals /Took
a good look around /just a part of a melting
whole / Exit or pay toll.”

After six years of touring Borders book-
stores up and down the Atlantic coast, Grey
Eye Glances is ﬁnally making a name for
itself. Both well-versed fans and casual radio
listeners will find that Eventide is that pleasant
surprise, an album that doesn’t need a warning
label on the front reading “Beware: Skip
Button May Be Required.”

Johnson and

Bailey both    

pull up lame

Leave it to a pulled quadricep to
spoil’ everybody’s fun. '

Last Sunday, in front of 25,000
track fanatics at Toronto’s
SkyDome, Michael Johnson’s leg
blew out in the middle of his race
with Donovan Bailey. Bailey became
the so-called “World’s Fastest
Human” by default when his oppo-
nent in the so-called “Challenge of
Champions” limped off the track.

P.T. Barnum (he of “there’s a
sucker born a minute” fame) would
have loved this so-called “sporting
event.” The two sprinters challenged
each other in a 150-meter race to
determine who was the fastest man
on the planet.

Never mind that the title
“World’s Fastest Human” has-always
been given to the winner of the 100-
meter dash at the Olympics. Never
mind that the. argument of 100-meter
runners versus 200-meter runners
could never be settled with such a
contrived setup.

Never mind that the fastest men
in this event were the promoters that
sneaked out of SkyDome with the
gate receipts and the CBS television
rights fees.

Said promoters played on
Canadian pride to sell tickets. Bailey
was held up as the savior of the
Canadian Olympic program, still
sporting a shiner from Ben
Johnson’s steroid-induced victory
over Carl Lewis in 1988.

The fans were expected to turn
out in droves, but ticket sales were
disappointing. Bailey wasn’t even
sure if he’d run unless the track was
re-designed to his specifications. An
all-star undercard was subjected to
more injuries than Evel Knievel and
looked nothing like the original
billing by the time the starting gun
sounded.

Still, Bailey got his shot. And in
front of a very-partisan crowd, he
blew by the wounded American hero
and into track history as the 150-
meter sprint/dash/race/whatever
world record holder.

As his countrymen cheered, the
Canadian Olympic champion took a
few moments to savor his victory.

And then, he blew it. After

THE PITT NEWS

    

Twelve Pitt athletes earned provisional
qualiﬁcations to the NCAA Outdoor Track
and Field Championships, but the mighty
axe of the NCAA has fallen.

Only three competitors, all from the
women’s squad, will represent Pitt this
weekend at the season-ending event, held at
the University of Indiana.

Trecia Smith, Angie Martin and
Chantee Earl are hoping to capitalize on
their performances at the ECAC
Championships in mid-May. The Lady
Panthers ﬁnished second to host George
Mason at the ECAC Championships, rack-
ing up 65 points in the three-day event.

Smith stole the show at the ECACS by
setting a new NCAA record in the triple
jump with a leap of 46.08 feet (14.22
meters) and heads to Bloomington with
high hopes of taking a national title in one
of four events. Smith goes to the nationals
as the ECAC champion in the high jump
(1.81 meters — 5’11.25”) and the long
jump (6.84 meters —- 22’00.75”) and will
also compete in the heptathlon.

Smith is currently ranked first in the
nation in both the triple jump and the long
jump, second in the nation in the heptathlon
and tied for 15th in the nation in the high
jump. By the way, she’s only a sophomore
and already an All—American.

The Panthers’ other two contenders are
Martin and Earl, who will both compete in
the 800-meter run. Maitin, also an All-
American, is ﬁnishing her senior season

‘I1

and has a final shot at an NCAA title, while
Earl is wrapping up her freshman season
and already giving the Big East some tough
competition. “

Martin earned a berth in the 800-meter
run for the NCAAS earlier this year with a
time of 2:05.56 and is currently ranked 12th
in the nation in the event. Earl is ranked

23rd in the nation, with a qualifying time -I

and a personal record of 2:06.46.
None of the men made it to the

NCAAs, but Orrel Green capped off his ,

senior season by running to a third-place
ﬁnish in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles
at last'week’s IC4A Championships. Green
fought an injury for a better part of the sea-
son, but he came back with his best time of
the year in the hurdles and earned an

. NCAA provisional qualiﬁcation. However,
it wasn’t enough to propel him to a ﬁnal .

chance at competing in the national cham-
pionships.

Jack ﬁnished his f1rst_season of NCAA
competition hoping to pick up where Green
left off. The freshman hurdler ﬁnished sixth
in the 110-meter high hurdles at George
Mason last weekend in a time of 14.14 sec-
onds and earned a provisional qualiﬁcation
in his first appearance at the IC4A
Championships.

Smith, Martin and Earl left for the
University of Indiana yesterday and will
begin competition this afternoon. The
championships run throughout the week,
with the ﬁnal events slated for Saturday,
June 7. Find out in next week’s edition of
The Pitt News how the Lady Panthers wrap
up the season in Bloomington.

Off-season tourneys keep Pitt grapplers busy

rian Knavish

 

 

With the Pitt wrestling team fin-
ishing 18th in the nation last season,

' they could handle this off-season in ~

one of two ways: relax and enjoy
their success, or put in some hard
work in hopes of reaching their goal
of cracking the top 10 next season.

Most Panther wrestlers have
selected the latter. As Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer puts it,
“Everyone trains hard from
September to March [the collegiate
wrestling season], but the guys who
train hard from March to September
are the ones who will be the upper-
level wrestlers.”

One of the most common and
effective ways wrestlers improve
and gain experience in the off-sea-

son is by entering freestyle tourna-
ments. NCAA regulations prevent
colleges from entering their teams
into these events, but wrestlers can
choose to enter these competitions
on their own. ‘

So far, there have been two

major tournaments in which Pitt,

grapplers have competed this sum-
mer. The University Nationals were
held April 18-20 at Northwestern
University, and the Espoir touma-
ment was held May 16-18 at Purdue
University.

Three of the six Panther grap-
plers who competed at University
Nationals placed. Freshman Rob
Loper and Sophomore Jonathan Hazi
placed fourth, and All-‘American
John Withrow placed fifth. Nick
Mengerink, Mike Ziska and Matt
Mueller also turned in strong perfor-

,mances at the event.

The three blue-chip recruits from
last year’s 10th-ranked‘ recruiting
class, Loper, Mueller and
Mengerink, made the trip to Indiana
for the Espoir tournament. Mueller
finished sixth at heavyweight.
Loper, who was recently named a
first-team Freshman ‘All-American,
captured second in the 132-pound
class, losing only to defending
National Champion Eric Guerrero of
Oklahoma State in the finals.

Both the wrestlers and coaches
were quick to point out that wins and
losses are not the most important
thing when it comes to off-season
wrestling. The focus should be on
the invaluable experience gained by
the athletes.

“It’s just real important for them

Wnssruuc, mo: 12 ~-

to get matches in,” Assistant Coach
Ed Palmer said. “A lot of guys take
this time. off, but our guys are work-
ing at getting better.”

According to Assistant Coach
Dan Payne, “The more times you
take the mat, the better you get, and
the better the competition is, the bet-
ter you get.”

Wrestling teammates in practice
can only help a wrestler to a point.
He needs to go up against as many
different wrestlers and see as_many
different styles as possible. This is
where‘ competing in summer
freestyle tournaments can prove
vital. .

‘‘All of the guys I wrestled [in

 

the summer tournaments] were guys
I didn’t see during the season,”
Loper explained. “Going up against
some new guys really helps.”

Some Pitt grapplers will travel‘

even farther to gain this exposure.
All-Americans Withrow and Mark
Bodo will leave Friday to spend a
week wrestling in Greece.

’ “I’m excited; it should be fun,”
Bodo said. “It should also help to
make me a better wrestler.”

Stottlemyer agreed. “Wrestling
guys from Europe really helps. The
experience they’ll gain is invalu-
able.”

The wrestlers who competed in
these tournaments are not the only

eevﬂti

ones who are working at getting bet-
ter this off-season. Many Pitt grap-
plers chose to stay on campus this
summer so that they could work out
with other team members.

While they haven’t competed in
any tournaments, Mark Gray, Mike
Dixon, Larry Sprecher and Jake
Schaus have also stayed in Oakland
and are working out several times a
week.

“These guys really want to get
better,” Palmer explained. “They
made the sacrifice to work and pay
rent so that they could work out with
the team while a lot of guys from
other teams are taking the summer
off.”

months of hype and promotion,
Donovan Bailey blew his chance at
the big time.

While his feet should have been
tired, Bailey still rammed them into
his mouth with amazing speed. He
called Johnson a coward. He called
Johnson a chicken. He called
Johnson’s injury a fake. He
announced to the world that his
opponent wasn’t even a real sprinter
— just a short-distance runner with a
good agent.

Johnson stayed quiet. A day or so
later, he and his medical team
announced that the quadricep pull
was so severe that it may force the
sprinter out of the upcoming U.S.
Nationals, and thus eliminate him

i from the World Championships later

this year.

Bailey, who had kept up the ver-
bal assault on his opponent, retracted
his statements in a hurry. His apolo-
gy hit the wire faster than he hit the
tape on Sunday.

Johnson went from coward to
competitor, from fowl to friend and
from not-a-real-sprinter to gee-I-
hope—he—gets-better-soon. Bailey
blamed the pressure of the event
($1.5 million to the winner,
$500,000 to the loser, for starters)
for straining the track stars’ friend-
ship.

In other words, Bailey made a
last—ditch effort to save his good
name before his chances at commer-
cials dip lower than Tonya
Harding’s. It was a move to keep the
real title both men were racing for
—— the world’s most‘ marketable track
athlete.

Chances are it won’t work, and
Nike will stick with the World’s
Second—fastest Human despite his
TKO in Toronto. Michael Johnson’s
gold track shoes and gold medals
may have been slightly tarnished by
the loss, but his reputation as a dedi-
cated athlete and upstanding citizen
remains safe.

Bailey, on the other hand, is out
of the picture. Johnson won’t talk
rematch, and it’s unlikely that
Donovan will challenge the winner
of the Boston Marathon to a 13—mile
race. Even Canadian sportswriters
attacked the sprinter for his «attitude,
and no future apologies will help
erase that image.

He won’t have another world
stage until the year 2000. Until then,
Bailey can split his time evenly
between training and practicing his
interview technique.

And cursing Michael Johnson’s
quadricep.

sport to the final frontier. The Jazz
point guard, who has more assists
than anyone in the history of the
NBA, had a playoff high of seven
turnovers thanks to Harper’s and
J ordan’s thievery.

Dennis Rodman is just as formi-
dable. This front-court monster is the
guy who gets the rebounds, blocks
shots and keeps the paint impenetra-
ble. That is, when he’s not busy dat-
ing Madonna, dying his hair green or
wearing women’s clothing.

Rodman’s aggressive style will
put him toe—to-toe with Karl Malone
for the series, and the mental strain
on the Mailman may have affected
his play in game one. The usually
steady Malone, after a night of frus-
tration with Rodman, missed two free
throws in a tie game with 9.2 seconds
left to go.

Scottie Pippen is the unsung
hero of the team. Yes, he does get
praise, but not enough. As he proved
Sunday by scoring 27 points despite a

‘ foot injury, he is a force to be reck-

oned with in the paint and on-the
perimeter. He’s got the style and
finesse to score consistently and is

low key enough to sneak past the .

defense when the Jazz starts leaning
on Jordan.

Keys to Bulls Victory:

1. The Bulls’ offensive plays are
a force tobe reckoned with and high-
ly organized for the each—man-for-
himself mentality of the NBA today.
Having an offensive structure and
playing as a team is what make the
Bulls unstoppable.

2. The combined scoring power
of Jordan and Pippen is .bolstered by
the aggressive Rodman. If Rodman

‘can consistently keep Malone off the

boards and keep the lanes open for
Jordan and Pippen, this may be a
four-game series. --

3. If history is any indicator, four
out of six ain’t bad. The Bulls have
the confidence of a string of champi-
onships to. keep them from getting
playoff jitters. The Bulls just aren’t
going to choke.

4. Chicago obviously rattled

one. If they can neutralize two of the

series, it should be a cakewalk.

series and dominate play inside. He
can’t be guarded one-on—one, and
when the Bulls do double, he will
kick out to the Jazz’s long-range
marksmen.

John Stockton and Jeff
Hornaceck give the Jazz two
perimeter players that will hit the
open three and create shots for team-
mates. Stockton is the best pure
point guard in the league. With the
exception of Steve Kerr, he will be
guarded by taller players. This will
allow him space to dribble and run a
fundamentally sound Jazz offense.

The battle in the paint between
Greg Ostertag and Luc Longley
favors the Jazz. Ostertag is a more
aggressive rebounder,
Longley’s two in game one, and he’s
a better defensive player.

The Jazz bench is one of the best
in the league. Shandon Anderson is
a high—ﬂying swingman who ignites
the fast break. Antoine Carr is a
savvy veteran who can score in the

 

seven to ’

 mom PAGE 13 

low post. Chris Morris is another
veteran who can hit the three. Center
Greg Foster brings intensity and an
energy boost to the ﬂoor.

Keys to Jazz Victory:

1. Stealing a game. Since they
didn’t win game one, they must win
game two. Most upsets in a seven-
game series occur when the under-
dog steals one of the first two games
on the road.

2. Defending home court. The
Jazz have only lost once at the Delta
Center since Dec. 12.

3. Stopping Pippen. Jordan will
get his points, but when Pippen
struggles, so do the Bulls.

4. Using the referees’ bias

toward Rodman to their advantage.

The Jazz need to Give him a little
elbow to the chops and let the ref
catch him retaliating.

5. A lot of pick and roll. The
Stockton/Malone pick and roll is the

best the league has ever seen.
