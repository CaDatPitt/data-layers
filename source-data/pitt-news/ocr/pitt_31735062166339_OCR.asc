ing, Wednesday evening at the Phi Epsilon Pi house. L
The election turnout was comparatively heavy, accord-

ing to Bob McCabe,~-~ Col. ’57,

The three elected senior posi-G 

tions are Larry Fiedler,.Bus. Ad.

and Harold Shapiro, Col.,’58.
Wittlin Re-elected‘ ,

Incumbent Charles .»Wittlin, Col.

’59, was re-elected, this time to ’

junior position. John Spear, Bus.
Ad. ’60, will represent the sopho-
more element on the judicial body.
If the interest generated by
the election carries over to the
coming year, the justices are
certain to have successful terms
of office.

Elections were held at the meet-
ing to ﬁll the ﬁnal two positions
on the new IF slate. Art Bloom,
Bus. Ad. ’59, last year’s delegate to
Men’s Council, was advanced to
represent IF interests in Student
Congress. Charles Wittlin, Col. ’59,
was elected to the position of
Men’s Council representative.

Changes Discussed

Bert O’Malley, Col. ’59, newly

elected president of IF, after the

installation ceremony conducted,

by past president, Reed Harper,
addressed IF at length on changes
and programming necessary for

progress during his term of of-.

ﬁce.
The length of meetings will be
cut to more reasonable dura-
tion and it is hoped that better
attendance will result. The
physical conditions of rooms al-
lotted for IF meetings in fra-
ternity houses must be improv-
ed. ’ A ,
iFraternities should support the

4%!

 

Spring Commons Room Dance, as
funds for the “S” Award scholar-
ship will be derived from pro-
ceeds.

Fraternities will also promote
their own interests by their at-
tendance, since this is an IF proj-
ect, and so will the student body
at large (“S” Award is open to
any junior man).

Strong Top Aid Weak

O’Malley further‘ stated. his be-
lief that for the good of the fra-
ternity system, the strong frater-
nities’ should aid their weaker
contemporaries so that all may
ﬂourish. More socials among vari-
ous fraternity groups should be
encouraged, as unity is all-im-
portant.

“ ‘Friendship, scholarship, and
brotherhood’ should be more
than mere words.” To compete
with the plush dorms, fraterni-
ties must have a dynamic pro-
gram to offer. ‘

Strong leaders require strong
workers. The membership of the
revitalized committee system must
be as powerful as its chairmen. A

constitutional revision committee

will be formed to change the by-
laws, and, particularly, to provide
a more just and equitable repre-
sentation arrangement.

O’Malley hopes for better pub-
licity through c_ity.and University
publications. New chairmen‘, for

“Ideas for Radio Station

Edward Bernstein, Col. ’58, president of Alpha Phi Omega,
service fraternity, and Neil Goodman, BA ’59 attended an
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System Meeting, Sunday, at
Union College in Schenectady, New York.

Bernstein and Goodman were seeking information and
ideas /at this meeting for an Alpha Phi Omega project, the

possib'1ity of obtaining a radio‘

station for Pitt. A committee has
sent and received letters from
-other Universities having radio
‘stations, hoping to gain informa-
tion from their experience.

A The committee has not yet re-
ceived an answer to their letter
to the Federal Communications

,; Commission regarding -possible
available broadcasting arrange-
r ments. The committee will have
»petitions in circulation all this
lweek, seeking student support.
A petition is also located at the
Student Desk. Students are ask-
ed to sign the petition if they
are interested and haven’t al-
I ready done so. . C
In addition to the co-chairmen,
Bernstein and Goodman, 10 other
students make up a 12-man cen-
tral committee. This committee
is in charge of sub-committees

Leiper Tells ofSp

By JOHN STRAUCH

“Speed’s the thing. Faster,
faster, faster.” Such a state-
ment is typical of the modern,
jet—propelled world in which
we live today.

It is not strange, then, that
this striving for speed, this desire
to go faster has reached our uni-

its strongest adherents here are
not the physics majors or en-
gineers, but rather 155 students
Who are enrolled in a one-credit
course called General Education
50.

General Education 50, more
commonly known as Develop-

course at Pitt designed to im-
prove both ,_the speed and com-
presension level of the reading
skill of students there enlisted.

Thompson Leiper, instructor

a graduate of Pitt, having major-
ed in the sciences and having re-
ceived his master’s degree in spec-
ialized reading. ’

Improves Reading

“Although the course,” says Mr.
Leiper, “is designed to improve’
the reading ability of incoming
freshmen who have scored low on
the orientation test, a great many
upper—classmen enlist in the
course for the purpose of raising
their speed-reading level to a
higher peak.” He emphasizes
strongly, that though speed is
strived for in the course, its prime
purpos e is, nevertheless, the
teaching of comprehension and
understanding of reading itself
and material read.

“In spite of the fact that the
ability of the students differs
widely,” adds Mr. Leiper, “this
creates no serious deterrent for
those students with greater skill,
for everyone works at his own
rate, the more advanced students
trying to improve an already high
rate, the weak students trying to
overcome handicaps which they
possess.”

In the course, both speed per-
ception (time required to recog-
nize a word or phrase) and span
perception (length ‘of line able
to be seen and read at a glance)
are taught by means of an elec-
trical device called a tachisto—
scope. Tachistoscope is derived
from two Greek words meaning
“to see with speed.”

The device is comparable to a
slide projector in its operation. A
uniquetype of slide with words
and phrases on it (This slide was
developed by Dr. Cleland here at
Pitt.) is inserted into the tachisto—

He’s creating Americas fourth coastline I

HE grades this gentleman is making have to be

good because America’s largest construction proj-
ect, the St. Lawrence Seaway, depends on them. When
it is ﬁnished in I 95 9, Americawill have a fourth coast-
line 8,000 miles long. Ships willsail 2,300 miles into
the nation’s industrial heart. Milwaukee, Chicago,
Detroit,-Cleveland and Buffalo will be seaports. I

To get the job done, 3,000 bulldozers, power shovels,
draglines, dredges and trucks must rip 180‘ million
tons of earth and rock from the ‘valley ﬂoor. This takes
machines with guts. And that’s why most of these huge
machines use Timken®-tapered roller bearings. Timken

"bearings roll the terrific loads, keep wheels and shafts

moving day in, day out, in steady, friction‘-free rhythm.

IKeeping these machines rolling smoothly is just one
way the Timken Company keeps America on the go.
We’re working hand-in-hand with all industry to make
machines go faster with more precision, fewer break-

 

downs, minimum maintenance. We’re helping to im-

prove the machines that are improving America.

This desire for continued progress made us a leader
—_—the world’s largest manufacturer of tapered roller
bearings and removable rock bits. And a leading pro-
diicer of ﬁne alloy steel.

Would you like to get in on the ground ﬂoor with a
company that’s on the go? If you’re interested, we’ll

With the 1957 Engineers’ Week a thing of the
past, one .can’t help envying the tremendous en-
thusiasm generated by the engineers. One of the
best organized and most closely knit groups on

each year at this time to help honor the gentle-

U A A’ Waking Nation

- 1 Many people it seems have forgotten the importance of

the national ramiﬁcations of free polio inoculation programs
on‘ amass scale as the one being held at the University at

i the preseiit time. T

The polio program at Pitt has been one of free vaccine,

. volunteer work and broad participation. The practical as-

pect oflmass inoculation is being shown to the nation and
the world. The uniﬁed effort put forth by students, faculty,
administration and their families, working together to pro-
vide a‘ solid offensive thrust against the crippler and to
prove -a point to the apathetic nation, has been rewarding in
many ways. ~ ‘

One reward is the prevention of disease. But above and

beyond this primary goal is the satisfaction of doing the

improbable. A great deal of personal and institutional gain

Twas overlooked in the drive to accomplish success of the

program. The University is paying, for the vaccine for all
those over 21 years of age and distributing it free. Not just
one or two shots but the full three inoculations absolutely
without anycharge. . . ,

. The spirit of what is happening at Pitt is being carried

around the nation by.unselﬁsh civic and private institutions. ..

Physicians have consented‘ to free mass inoculation programs
.which will permit the immunization of the greatest number
of people without thinking of monetary sacriﬁce they were
‘making in giving up the right to inoculate for a charge.
As a result of this self—sacriﬁcing attitude and enthusi-
asm across the nation, oﬁicials of the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis stated last Monday that, as of March 1,

«an estimated 51 million persons in the"’United States had

received polio shots. 7
Another reward is found in the heartwarming words
of Dr. Dwight H. Murray, president of the American Medi-
cal Association, in a recent magazine article.’ Dr. Murray
stated that the Salk vaccine is “now safe beyond any ques-
tion” because millions of Americans “have received one or
more injections” without suffering ill effects. '

One of , the most «compelling

1957 Student Politics . . . .

Indifference or Intrigue?

« By Murray Chess

Only one political party has

asked for official recognition for
the University elections that will
be held on April 10. This party,
when sanctioned by the Student
Election Com-
mittee, will beg‘
known as the.
All — University .
Party.
_ Whether it is
the lack of in

ganized stu

that call fo ,
other means of"
campaign i n g,
this year marks the fewest num-
ber of recognized political par-
ties since their official start in
the 1955 elections.

It is surprising to see this de-
cline in parties especially if one
considers the interest that stu-
dentshad for some time prior
to 1955 when very unofficial
parties were formed. .

In fact, these secret parties, of
which no one claimed knowl-
edge, reached. such ,a point in

their campaign tricks in 1954

   

 

 

 

that the administration threat-
ened to cancel student elections
for that year. However, with
some good old political bargain-
ing, the ofﬁcers of these groups

, settled the issue.

Seek Recognition

Then the next year the men
students saw no reason for keep-
ing the identity of the parties a
secret and sought to win the
official recognition of parties by
the Election Committee. An as-
sistant professor in the political
science department spoke to
Men’s Council in behalf of party
supporters. The Election Com-
mittee initiated party recogni-
tion.

At, ﬁrst three parties“ were
formed, but before the election
date two of them, the Veteran-
Independent and the Pitt Par-
ties, combined to form an un-

‘ beatable slate. But this was not

the only reason for the crushing
defeat of the Panther party.
Many students felt that the cam-
paign methods of the Panther-
men were unsavory.

Still, the number of voters in-
creasedby 25 per cent.

because of these methods that
were employed and because par-
ty bills were not paid until a
long while after_the election.
Three deﬁnite parties gained
recognition —— the Panther, All-
Pitt, and Independent. When the

campaigns were concluded and ’

the balloting completed, the re-
sults put the candidates of the
Panther Party in major control.

An again there was an in-
crease of 20 per cent in the vot-
ing.

The Election Committee ap-
proved political parties’ for this
year’s elections. However, very

little interest was stirred up for ~

the re-election of parties. At the
last possible time, the All-Uni-
versity"party was set up. Could
it be that major organized
groups of students are ready to,
revert to the old system of sec-
recy and quiet dealings?

‘If so, this would be most un-
fortunate considering the cir-
cumstances that arose in 1954.
However, it is possible to run a
campaign in this manner if it,
is kept on a high plane. That is
something, though, that will

have to be judged during“ the —

next two weeks.

Coach Warren Neiger’s star
protege provided the bulk of
the glory for the local acrobats.
Burdened with the favorite’s
role, Darling won the event in
which he ﬁnished second at last
year’s NCAA title match.

Soph Dave Hirst also came
through on "the aerial apparatus
with an excellent third place ﬁn-
ish. The slender -gymnast then
picked up three more team points
as he came in eighth on the tumb-
ling mat. That was the extent of
the Blue and Gold’s scoring.

With 22 team points, the Neiger-
men ﬁnished ninth in the nation,
up one notch from last season.
Penn State, spearheaded by their
one many gang--Armando Vega
snatched the national gym title
from defending Illinois, by a mar-
gin of eight and one half points.

The Center County boys, tutor-

ed by Olympic coach Gene Wett
stone, thus completed an unde-,

another national trophy.

form of the announcement of

lengthy 25-game schedule. .
Opening day for the Panthe

V . nine will be April 2 on the home

grounds of Indiana State Teachers.
Coach Lewis vis in his third
year as baseball tutor and will
attempt to rack up a winning
record with a seasoned squad.
The local mittmen have been

ing recent weeks as they await
the expected break in the
weather. ~
The Blue and Gold will play
only nine games on a “home” dia-

lmond, East End’s large Mellon

Park. Home opponents are high-
lighted by such district standouts
as West Virginia, Penn State, and
Duquesne. Navy, Ohio State, and
Cornell will provide sectional op-
position away from home.

whiz, turned in one of the great-
est individual performances
ever. In winning two events
and placing in five others, Vega
accounted for 55 of his team’s
88 points. Seldom has such mag-
niﬁcent versatility been display-
ed in the United States.

Individual titles were well dis-

.tributed as Illinois took three,

headed by Olympian Able Gross-
ﬁeld’s win on the high bar; and
Penn State and Los Angeles State
took two each.

The winner in the rope climb,
incidentally, was a boy named
Marx from L. A. State who slith-
ered up the twenty feet in a
“revolutionary” time of 3.1 sec-
onds. Pitt’s Dave Rubber ﬁnished
in a multiple tie for ninth on the
rope. ~ _
For Tom Darling the national
victory was a reward after years
of practice. Starting at Philadel-
phia’s Lincoln High School, Dar-
ling soon found a preference for
the rings and was eager to con-
tinue his work when he came to
Skycraper U. three years ago.
After a’ successful freshman
year, the diminutive acrobat cli-
maxed his ﬁrst season of varsity
competition with second place ﬁn-
ishes on the ﬂying rings in the
Easterns, the NCAA champion-
ships, and the National-~A.A.U.
ﬁnals.

A up .to. Ed’s father, Rex, has staged

an incredible one-man show down

, through the years. As an under-

graduate at Oklahoma A&M Rex
won three NCAA titles.
Now as“ ’

he has lifted

‘as an undergrad-
ate at ‘Pitt. So
now it is up to
Ed, who already
owns two titles,
to equal the feats
of his immediate "
family.

The Peery story really begins
when Rex entered .Oklahoma
A&M in the early l930’s. 1.; all
four regular seasons as a wrestler

« A there,‘ Rex didn’t lose a single

match. As a sophomore, he won
the ﬁrst NCAA title to come into

I _ the Peery household. He received
. the Dotter award for being the

high point scorer for a team in his
junior year, and tied for high
point honors the following season.

Upon graduation, Rex entered

. coaching and instructed teams
in three different high schools
over a 14-year period. After
spending the last nine seasons at
Tulsa Central, he came to the
University. of Pittsburgh in 1949.

At Tulsa Central, Hugh, eldest

son of Rex, began his wrestling ‘

career. There, Hugh won the 112-
pound state _championship both as
a junior and as a senior.

The first season at Pitt in 1950
was a heartbreaking and discour-
aging one for the older Peery as
he attempted to revive a sport in
which the school \hadn’t partici-
pated in for 15 years‘.

The Blue and Gold had aban-
doned wrestling in 1944, after

A dropping 28 straight meets. And

returning to competition in 1950,

the Panthers‘ ran their streak to '

38 straight, by ‘losing all ten
regular meets. V
The next season, however, the
intensive training program se_t_‘up
by Rex began to pay off. The Pan-
thers snapped their losing streak
and came off the mats with seven
wins and seven losses.

As a freshman that year Hugh

was unbeaten. He was named to .

the Pan American team that went
to Buenos Aires, Argentina. There
he won the 114—pound title,
though in regular dual meet com-
petition he had wrestled at 123

pounds.

In the 1952 season, Pitt as a
team won nine and lost two.
Hugh, a sophomore then, won
ten and lost one, and‘ followed
it up by winning the Four I
championship and taking his

first NCAA. crown at 115
pounds. ’

As a junior and senior, Hugh‘
repeated as NCAA c h a m p i o -1
while, the Panther team chalked
up identical records of ten victor-

.. ‘ ies and one de-
feat in each of‘
t h o s e seasons,
1953 and 1954.

In duplicating
the NCAA feats
of his father,
Hugh, in his sen-
ior y e a r , was
n a In e d as the
winner of the
1 9 5 4 T a y 1 o r
award.

M e a nw hile,
that season Ed
was going unde-
feated as a mem-
ber of the Pitt
freshman team.
He had gone
through Shaler
High School
, Winning W. P. I.
A. L. champion-
ships three times,
and taking the
state title in his
sophomore and
junior seasons.

.Ed narrow-

— ly missed tak-
ing the state crown in his senior .
_year, losing out. on a disputed
decision in the ﬁnals. That
’match was the only one he ever
lost in high school. '
Ed’s ﬁrst season on the Panther
varsity --in 1955 saw him main-
taining the Peery tradition of
wining the NCAA championship.
Now only one more title stands
between Ed and the family tradi-
tion. Obesrvers are wondering if

it can happen; if three members of A

a wrestling family can each win
three NCAA titles.

At any rate, many interested
eyes will be. on Ed as he comes
onto the tournament mat to cli-
max one of the most amazing stor-
ies in the history of collegiate
wrestling.

NOW YOU CAN BE YOUNGER
THAN SHE IS!

V It's ascientiﬁc fact that girls reach emotional ma-
turity earlier than boys. For this reason freshman girls
decline to make romantic alliances with freshman boys.

Thus, the freshman boys are left dateless, and many’s
the night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep.
An equally damp situation exists among upper-class
girls. With upperclassmen being snapped up by freshman
girlg the poor upper-class girls are reduced to dreary,
manless evenings of Scrabble and home perrnanents.

There is a solution for this morbid situation — a very
simple solution. Why don’t the two great have—n0t groups
ﬁnd solace with one another? —

True, there is something of an/age diiferential, but
that need not matter. Take the case of Albert Payson

, Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye.

Albert Payson, a freshman in sand and gravel at
Vanderbilt ‘University, was walking across campus one
day, weeping softly in his loneliness. _Blinded by tears,
he stumbled upon thesupine form of Eustacia Vye, a

senior in wicker and raffia; who was collapsed in a ’

wretched heap on the turf.

“Why don’t you watch where you’re going, you
squirt?” said Eustacia pecvishly.

“I’m sorry, lady,” said” Albert Payson and started to
move on. But suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspira-
tion. “Lady,” he said, “you’re miserable because you can’t
get a-date. So am I. So why don’t we date each other?"

“Surely you jest!” cried Eustacia, looking with scorn
upon his youthful head and body. -

“Oh, I know I’m younger than you are,” said Albert
Payson, “but that doesn’t mean we can’t ﬁnd many splen-
did things to do together.” A

“Like what?” asked Eustacia.

“Well,” said Albert Payson, “we could get a third and
play some one—o-cat.”

“Bah!” said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.

“All right then,” said Albert Payson, “we could go ‘A

down to the pond and skip some stones and maybe catch

‘a few frogs.”

“Ugh!” said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length.
“How about some run-sheep-run?” he suggested.

- “You are callow, green, and immature,” said Eustacia,
“and I will thank you to absent yourself at once!”

Sighing, Albert Payson lit a cigarette and started
away.

“Stay!” cried Eustacia. I
“Was that,” she asked, “a Philip Morris you just lit?”
“What else?” said Albert Payson.

“Then you are not immature!” she cried, clasping'
him to her clavicle. “For to smoke Philip Morris is the
very essence of wisdom, incontrovertible proof that you
know rich, natural pleasure from pale, poor substitutes!
Albert Payson, I am yours!” V, '

Who is the better wrestler—-—Hugh Peery or Ed Peery?
Those who watched Hugh wrestle maintain that he was su-
perior to his younger brother.‘ Those -who witnessed Ed
claim that he is the «better grappler. Those who were fortu-
nate enough to see both the Peery boys in action are
torn between Hugh and Ed, with ‘many giving‘ the edge to
Hugh because of his ability to score falls whereas Ed usually
overpowers his foe and wins by a decision.

During his three-yea_r‘reign as national champion Hugh
compiled a 54-1 record. The only loss was inflicted by Bob
Homan of Penn State in Hugh’s sophomore year.. After that
setback the older Peery never tasted defeat again until the
Olympics. Ed’s career chart now stands’ at 47-1 with the
tough ,NCAA’s still ahead. The younger Peery’s loss came

Springﬁeld is not a member '

They " were competing by

In trying to compare the
two, one runs into a multitude
of unanswerable problems.  ‘
Hugh wrestled at 123 pounds
while Ed goes at 130 pounds.
Here we would say that the
edge would have to go to Ed.
Hugh was a “natural” 123
pounder, and he Vvrestled at
that weight. There was very
little sacriﬁce or disadvantage

All things being equal, Hugh
had the advantage. It would
do injustice to say that Ed
was the better man, though.
The number of falls must be
considered. This is the de-
partment where Hugh ex-
celled.

When Hugh went on the
mat chances were excellent
that he would pin his foe in
short order. These falls can’t
be considered too lightly be-
cause they are worth an addi-
tional _two points in the over-
all team scoring.

Bob came directly to

Meanwhile Ed scores very
few falls; only a nominal
number when st a c k e d
against Hugh’s fall chart.
One factor which merits at-
tention is the weight factor
in the case of Ed. He, too,
appears to be a “natural”

.123 pounder, but has
wrestled at 130 pounds in
all dual meets. He had to
gain his ‘victories against
men who had dropped from
the 137-pound class to meet
him in the 130-pound ranks.
Here was a “natural” 123
pounder taking on a “natur-
al” 137 pounder in_ many in-
stances and beating them all

Arriving at a ﬁnal decision
would not only” do injustice
to one, but would likewise be
impractical. Coach Rex Peery,
their father, sums it up bet-
ter than anyone when he says,
“It would be,Hugh’s skill and

Two years ago, Robert Evereﬂ asked himself this question. Today, as
Administrative Assistant lo the Divisional Controller; Bob reviews his
experience at IBM and gives some pointers that may be helpful to you in
taking the first, most important step in your business career.

TRATION

Why Bob picked IBM

Bob made a careful study of existing
opportunities before selecting IBM
for his career. He had a dozen cam pus.
interviews; took nine company tours.
IBM’s M.B.A. program interested
him——because, as he says, “It gave
me a chance to review the entire
‘company before starting an actual
line assignment.” He was intrigued
by the increasing use of data process-
ing equipment in ﬁnance andlhe knew

that IBM was a leader in this ﬁeld.

 

Salary-wise, he found IBM better
than many, but it. was company
growth potential that motivated his
choice. “Opportunity certainly exists

at IBM,” he says. “Growth factors
alone will account for many new exec-
utive positions. A’ second factor is the
trend toward decentralization, which
also creates new jobs_. These factors,
plus IBM’s ‘promote-from—within’
policy, add up to real opportunity.”

Fraternity Elections Fill
IF Judiciary Positions

master, might expedite matters for
the individual fraternities.

O‘Malley compared the frater-
nity system to a large bank, in
which deposits must be made as
well as withdrawals.

Don Milletary, advisor to IF,
at the conclusion of O’Malley’s
remarks gave a rather complete
evaluation of fraternities’ past
progress, present position, and
future necessities.

Milletary stated that he had, in
his ﬁrst six months tenure con-
ﬁned his comments to IF to their
responsibility to the University.

This did not preclude that Mil-
letary wasunaware of the basic,
underlying problem of IF. He
,merely wished to become better
acquainted on a face-to-face basis
with fraternity men.

Advisor Tells of Future

Mi11etary’s remarks dwelt on at-

titudes, rather than speciﬁcs of
problem or remedy. A ﬁtting title
for his address might well be, said
the advisor, “Future of Pitt Fra-
ternities.”

He delineated the body of his
remarks into ﬁve main areas of
fraternity responsibility: Respon-
sibility to New Men, Scholarship,
University, Community, and Social
Activity.

“Pitt fraternity men have no
future unless they fulﬁll their
responsibilities.” Ideas of fair
play, honor, understanding of
others, idealistic as these traits
may sound, must be injected in-

. to pledges of fraternities. The

groups must instill a genuine set
of values in their new men and,
_in short, build gentlemen.

Much of the criticism of present
day university life has been that
hardly anything fundamental re-
sults in the individual from his
experience. Guiding beliefs and
attitudes remain unchanged. This
trend must be reversed.

Scholarship Important

Fraternities have a strong re-
sponsibility to scholarship, Mil-
letary advised. The fraternity men
must be conscious of their in-
feriority in this respect, as evi-
denced by the failure of so many
pledges to attain the required 1.0
average.

They must correct conditions
leading to poor scholastic con-
ditions. Assistance may be solic-
ited both from the school and
from national fraternity schol-
arship committees. A real need
for a sound scholarship program
exists.

The responsibility of fraternities
to the school is obvious. The fra-
ternity system is an integral part
of the educational program of this
university. Team work between
university and fraternity system
is a necessity. Conditions of mutu-
al respect, conﬁdence, and trust
must remain prevalent.

Community Role Cited
The community role of fraterni-

ties has recently come to the fore. '

A portion of the efforts of the In-
terfraternity Council and individ-

, ual‘ fraternities should be directed

to the community. The recent
muscular dystrophy drive is a con-
crete example of this type of proj-
ect.

Finally, Milletary stated that.
as social fraternities, the groups ’
must have effective social pro-
grams to offer. This should not
be so ostentatious as to draw at-

men and chairman of the Uni-
versity committee for the polio
program stated that the import-
ance of the“ second shot cannot be
overstated.

“Taking the first shot without
the second is like making a mo-
tion which dies for lack of a sec-
ond. The second shot is every bit
as important as the first to pro-
vide immunization against 7 the
disease," he said. ‘

tention to fraternities as groups
for the privileged. _
Nor should it interefere with
the academic progress of mem-
bers. The program must take into
account university rules and reg-
ulations.

Co-operation among the frater-
nities could add much to the ef-
fectiveness of the socials. The so-
cial activities of fraternities must
be part of the campus setting and
provide a positive contribution in
educational terms to the univer-
sity. , - 

In conclusion, Milletary reaf-
ﬁrmed his original contention that
fraternities have no future unless
they fulﬁll their responsibilities.
