City, University Try 
|To AgreeonChange A

a By ESTHER MISIIELEVICH - _
Negotiators from the City of Pittsburgh and from the
University of Pittsburgh’s board of trustees meet today at
4 p.m. in the City--County Building to make. an agreement

be increased from 120 to 300 or

350. The exact number depends
on how,much ﬁnancial aid Pitt
gets from state, city, or other
agencies to share the cost of treat-
ment.

Charity Idea Endorsed

The idea of turning Municipal
Hospital into a charity institution
has been endorsed by the Alle-
gheny County Health Study Com-
mittee. This committee urged the
city to lease theﬁten-story building
to_Pitt, to be operated “as a gen-
eral hospital for the care of the
"medically indigent” as well as for
“teaching and research.”

The Health Study Committee
also recommended that 40 to 80
beds be set ‘aside by Pitt for
treatment of patients in the
county who have communicable
diseases; the committee also
stated that 20 to 30 beds should
be used for emergency cases
awaiting committment to a men-
tal ‘institution. _‘

Also, some; facilities should be
provided for patients’ with chronic
illnesses who “could be used for
teaching purposes and for re-
cearch.” ._

Dr. Moore, vice chancellor, re-
ported that gitt has planned all
along to earmark some beds for
communicable diseases.

‘City Shuns Cost

requires-, to keep paying the cost
of medical care for residents with
such diseases if they can’t afford
to pay, even when Pitt takes over
the hospital. However,‘ the city
doesn’t want to shoulder any of
the cost of treating patients iwith
other diseases, which is one of the
reasons holding up the transfer of
the hospital.

The Health Study Committee
suggested that the best way out
would be for Pitt to pay all of

, the expenses and then be reim-

bursed by various “governmen-

Chancellor} Public    

Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld will deliver his ﬁrst
speech to University personnel tonight by remote control
and for that we can thank the medium of television. Deans
of. the Schools who have not yet been able to reach him;

‘ faculty members who haven’t been able to meet him‘, and

students who are still saving Dr. Fitzgerald's places in the
Tuck Shop for him will be able to see andhear Pitt’s top
man in action over WQED. No one should miss it.

As we understand’ it, Dr. Litchﬁeld will speak to Cen-
tury Club Alumni (one hundred clams per person) concern-
ing the role of alumni in the program; he will elucidate on

/plans announced this summer to ‘_‘make Pitt one of the

Worl_d’s foremost universities.” .

And although he slips into town only once a week, he’s
proven himself a fast worker; he has taken a major role in
the recent Schenley apartment-hotel purchases. ' ’ '

City officials _and newspaper people are still talking
about his speech to the Civic Club of Allegheny County last
fall. A top-notch orator, the new chancellor might reveal
.more concrete plans about improved curriculum and use
of the Hotel for a student union. We would be disappointed
if he _didn’t. .

Blue and Gold cagers Saturday night at University Park
in the ﬁnal game of the season for the Panther passers.

The hoop attraction will commence immediately follow-
ing a wrestling match between the two schools.

Earlier in the season, the Jungle Cats triumphed 78-60,
but the home court advantage of the Nittany Lions should
rate the locals no more than even money to close the cam-

paign with a victory.

'. No matter how great the odds are when these two teams

I? f clash, they. seem to put out a little:

extra effort when cast an under-
dog that usually deﬁes the odds’
and makes for a close game.

Ti/mmons will wind up his third
season at the helm with the best
record of any Blue and Gold men-.
tor in 19 years. The local hoopsters
currently possess. a 14-10 "slate
‘which is the best mark in Tim-
‘nrions’ three-year tenure.

Newest addition to Pitt’s ath-

club, is being plagued by the
growing "pains common to all
young activities.

With a membership of 33 men,
the club is still in need of an
adequate place to work out. How-
ever, President Chuck Williams
announced the club will begin to
function as a team, with the hope
of eventually gaining varsity
status.

To be even considered for re-

Last Minute Surge
Wins For Women

Following up the winning
streak of their “better halves,”
the Varsity team, the Female bas-
ketball team, defeated Carnegie
Tech, 45—38,- on Monday after-
noon in the cathedral gym.

In a last minute drive the Pan-
therettes pulled ahead to defeat
their neighbors in a fast moving
contest. Lending her team to vic-
tory was captain Jan McConnell
with 17 points.

Pitt was trailing 23-20, but the
excellent guarding of Lois Moog-
erman, Carol Smart and Marcia
Bradley held the Tartans to.only
15 points in the second half.

The star rebounder for Pitt was
Sarah Finnin whose fast—moving
plays and accurate shooting help-
ed to keep Pitt out in front.

The last quarter was the de-
ciding factor in the game and Pitt
put on the pressure with their

guards and forwards pressing
hard to defeat their favorite
rivals.

Poise, Confidence
By GORDON CLOWNEY
The Pitt Speech Depart-
ment, in conjunction with the

ciety, offers an extensive dra-
matic activities program for
children of the Pittsburgh.
area.

The program, which consists of
two parts, is under the direction
of Barbara Mclntyre, assistant
professor of speech at the Uni-
versity.

V Creative dramatics, which is the
ﬁrst part of the program, is a
product that the elementary edu-
cation 162 class participates in.
Members of the class, juniors, sen-
iors and graduate students in ed-
ucation, observe groups of children
under the direction of Miss McIn-

a lecturer in the Speech Depart-
ment.

The creative dramatics which
the children participate in is in-
formal spontaneous drama created
by the players themselves. Re‘-
quiring no audience or formal pro-

confidence through themedium of

350 Enrolled‘

There are approximately 350
children enrolled in this program,
ranging in age from six to twelve
years. They are children whose
parents want to give them’ a little
extra opportunity for expressive
dramatic work. Class sessions are
held weekly at the Cathedral of
Learning, and tuition for the se-
mester is twelve dollars, which
covers the instructor’s expenses.

Once a month, ‘on a Friday
afternoon, the children appear
on WQED’S .“Childrens’ Corner,”
on the section of the program.
called “Act a Story.” ,'

_The second phase "of the dra-

matic activity .is the Children’s
Theatre Workshop. The main
purpose of the Workshop is to’
provide the students of the,
Elementary Education 164 class
with practical training in the
teaching of children.

The adult class members pro-
duce formal plays, working with
children who have expressed an
interest in dramatics. One or two
plays are put on each year and are
presented at Falk School Auditor-
ium. All plays are shown to the
public with no fee being charged.
I Presented Play

_‘Last year the children, under

dents, ,presented an original play
by one of the member of the
speech department‘ faculty. The
play was “The Enchanted Stove”
by Kenneth F. Edgar, instructor_ in
speech.

Over the past two years the
adults and children have pro-
duced the “Three Bears,” “The
Dancer,” and “Thev Enchanted
Forest.” Last year, the group
toured to twenty grade schools
throughout the- Pittsburgh area
to give performances.

A project for buying class. rings
is presently being developed for
Pitt students. The project idea,
developed by Joseph Anania, Bus.
Ad.‘ ’56, andi.Marvin Recht, Bus.
’57, was formed because
many Pitt seniors have-graduated
without their class rings and
without knowing‘ how or where
they could get them. Anania also
stated that a savings and better
service can be adopted as a result
of this project. '

The committee consisting of
Anania and Recht is now con-
tacting various jewelers as to

in supplying the students with
class rings. At present, there is
