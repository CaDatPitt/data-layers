US. Education Dept.
Gi-vesA dditiona lGrant

The United States Department of Education has award-
ed an additional $110,000 to the University’s Department of

Special Education and rehabilitation. The money will be
used to train 12 teachers for emotionally disturbed and re-

tarded ‘children.

A previous grant in April of $69,000 has already pro-

- Grad School

vided money for students inter-
ested in visually handicapped and
crippled children.

The money is given to students
in the form of fellowships which
include a stipend, dependency al-
lowance, and tuition. The program
involves two trimesters of course
work combined with student
teaching experience in each stu-
dent's particular ﬁeld.

The program is only open to
students in the Graduate School of
Education and will begin this
year. Prospective recipients must
show a clear interest in the handi-

" capped child according to Dr.

Godfrey Stevens, acting chairman
of the Department of Special Edu-
cation and Rehabilitation.
The University started its
training program for positions
of leadership in the area of
work with handicapped children
about ﬁve years ago. According
to Dr. Stevens, the Federal
grants indicate that the U. S.
Office of Education has a con-
siderable amount of conﬁdence
in the University program.
Co-operating agencies in the
program will be the Pittsburgh
Public Schools, Allegheny Special
Services, Western Pennsylvania
School for the Blind and the
Western Pennsylvania School for
the Deaf. ' ‘

  

Booklet Ready-

William French, assistant to the
Dean of the School of Liberal
Arts, has recently written a
pamphlet entitled G r a d u a t e
Schools and Graduate Fellowships.

The pamphlet is described as “a
general introduction for interested
undergraduate students.” It pro-
vides students seeking information
with a guide for the procedure for
applying to graduate school, as
well as some helpful hints.

‘ For example. the pamphlet
explains that the best sources
of information concerning grad-
uate schools are departmental
advisers and faculty members.

Concerning fellowships, the
pamphlet states that their average
amount ranges from $1,500 to
$2,500 plus tuition. The pamphlet.
also states that “although compe-
tition is keen for the more dis-
tinguished fellowships, a student
who possesses a 3.0 quality point
chance of receiving an award.”-

The pamphlet is available in the

With wickedly pungent satire and wit,‘
Cambridge hits the funny bone-and
more! He dramatizes vital issues. ..‘
he brilliantly‘ uncovers “moments of‘
truth" of the fads and foibles of our
times...he comments, with disarm-,
ing innocence, on the after-effects of
the'Negro revolt. Godfrey Cambridge‘
is ‘uproarious.’ Godfrey Cambridge is‘
a name to remember. “Ready or Not},
Here's Godfrey Cambridge" is_' an
album to own.
