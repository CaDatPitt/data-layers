cation which gives information

Fraternity

‘No-Politics ’

Proposal Causes Split

Among Coed Leaders  

Repercussions to last \Vednesday’s political bombshell, which

saw ten campus sororities adopting a “no-politics pledge,’

*7

rolled

across the student political» front late last week and precipitated an
immediate storm of protest that found outstanding co-ed leaders
charging “dictatorship and Hitlcrisni” on the twelfth ﬂoor.
Unofficial 1nen’s fraternity opinion on the announceinent by
Helen Wilson, C40, president of Fraternity Presidents’ Council,
that women’s fraternities will “volun.taril.y abandon” politics this

year continued to brand the twelfth ﬂoor

Ci

clean-up ” a “ridiculous

sham,” saying that the political history of the sororities proves
that they will not adhere to the “purity pledge.”

Although proponents of the “no-politics covenant” continued to hold
out hope that the four powerful houses that bucked the FPC move——
Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Theta
Phi Alpha—would soon fall into line, spokesmen for the houses «declared
emphatically Friday that they will take no such step.

Many members of the sorority “unregimented four” were bitterly out-
spoken in their condemnation of the motives of the “clean-up.”

O

This Pledge . .

“I . . . . . . . . . . . . .. President of
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .., declare in
the name of my fraternity that we
are convinced that campus pol-
itics are d.etrimental to the best
interests of women’s fraternities
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Therefore, we will refrain both as
individuals and as a group from
any formal or informal political
set-up or agreement, and will
denounce any such action among
members of our group.”

. . Caused Talk

Following are additional student
comments on the “no—po1itics” plan
of Fraternity Presidents’ Council:

Pat Cusicls. E40, Phi Kappa, pres-
ident of SFA:

“The sororities will resort to un-
derhanded politics‘ which Miss Amos

doesn’t Want them to do. So—called
dirty politics will really become
dirty on the Pitt campus. I don’t

see any physical way by which Miss
Amos can prevent sororities from
running with fraternities as they
should.

“Of course there is a question of
moral persuasion, which includes
loss of high ofﬁces and prestige in
women’s activities and often goes
even further than that on members
of erring sororities, I am sorry to
say.”

Gertrude Broido, C40, Alpha Ep-
silon Phi, SFA Executive Commit-
tee:

“I a.m entirely in favor of the
plan. ’Ultimately it will result in a
movement away from involvement
in politics. The objectionto run-
ning on a slate, independent or
fraternity, is that you run with a
few interior people. This is not
directcd'at'SFA in particular, but
at all politics in activities.”

Nancy Digby, C40, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, secretary of SFA: 
“The plan proposed by FPC is no

’real solution to the problem. Al.-

though designed to eliminate slate
voting, it succeeds only in clouding
and confusing the issue, and will
result in underhanded political
dealings."

Doris‘ Wacker, C40, Kappa Kappa

Gamma: A
“After this spring’s women’s ap-
pointments we’ll be-able to see if

They bluntly laid authorship for
the plan at the doorstep of the ofﬁce
of the dean of women—despite re-
peated declarations by Miss Wilson
and Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant
dean of women and faculty advisor
to FPC, that the move was “volun-
tary” and “student prompted.”
“Further Dictatorship” —

Jane Epping, BA40, honorary
ROTC cadet colonel, Theta Phi
Alpha, spoke for many sorority

women who hesitated to be quoted
when she charged Friday:

“This is an attempt to further
dictatorship. We were told we
would be ostracized on campus if
we voted against the measure. This
should make no difference, of
course, since according to the
twelfth floor all women’s positions
on campus are to be chosen by
merit . . supposedly. Why ‘don’t
they take politics out of the twelfth
floor. We feel that Hitlerism and
dictatorship reign supreme up there.
Why doesn’t all this idealism start
at home?”
l’olitica.l. Campaign . . .

But Miss Amos was quick to deny
any part in the revolutionary move.
When asked Friday afternoon if
she authored the FPC action she de-
clared, “I don’t know what the
covenant is; in fact, I haven’t read
t.he paper (Pitt News).” However,
Miss Amos admitted that she was
acquainted with the general outline
and purpose of the covenant and
declared that it simply “seeks the
realization of the democratic ideal.”

Explaining that she had been
active in Illinois political cam-
paigns in 1914 and 1916, Miss Amos
said that she learned that politics
inevitably had “damned free peo-
ple.”

VVorka.ble Plan

“I haven’t been in a single meet-
ing in which the measure was dis-
cussed. However,” the dean of
women said, “I’d like to see student
life as it is expressed in extra—cur—
ricular activities raised from the
level of childishness to that con-
sistent with the University ideal.”

Miss Amos prophesied that the
time is approaching when sororities
and fraternities alike will learn that
it is to their best advantage to=work
conscientiously toward merit alone
in student government and activ-
ities. Asked if she believed such a
plan workable, Miss Amos de-
clared, “It’s very workable.”

Pointing tothe turbulent history
of student government on campus,
Miss Amos observed that in the
past government has often. found
itself in an “impasse” of rotten poli-
tics. “Bloc ﬁghts bloc until any

real advancement is killed within

‘Religion in Personal

Living’ at Pm

With the theme of “Religion in Personal Living,” Religious
Emphasis week opens on campus this morning.

Gradually both religious and secular educational groups have
begun to realize that religion should not be conﬁned to churches,

~ but should be recognized as an important force related to the life

of the individual as well as to the World as a Whole.
The Reli.gious Emphasis program presented on campus last

year was an example of this new attitude.

Religious and lay

leaders discussed with students the relation of religion to labor re-
lations, problems of democracy, and home a11d marriage.

This year ’s program will continue that broad view by attempt-
ing to bring to the attention of students the importance of religion

in their own lives.

The application of religion to everyday living is signiﬁcant of
a more healthy, more rational and mature attitude toward the
proper place of religion in any age.

Religion does have a deﬁnite place in university life, and the
programs this week cannot stress that importance too much. Stu-
dents who are anxious to discuss the latest political and social trends
should be equally interested in religious trends and effects if they
want a more complete picture of world conditions.

Civilized People

Eat at Tables

Every so often someone calls up the News office to suggest,
bluntly or with tact, that we run a front page editorial calling upon
all the decent forces in the University to band together to rid it Of
that awful, awful, awful thing, the littering" of the eighth ﬂoor
stairs by those who eat lunch there.

Strangely enough, no __one has ever complained that the stairs
might not bea sanitary eating place. Since they aren’t, andsince
the students who eat lunch there do so not by choice, but because
the Tuck Shops are overcrowded, we offer the following simple

solution :

Open up room 828 Cathedral between 11 :30 and 2 o’clock ever)’
day and let its tables and chairs be used for eating. Other activi-

ties that might be carried on there can use another room on the

eighth floor.

The use of 828 will provide better eating quarters and remove

the necessity for eating on the stairs.

And that will remove the

source of much of the waste on the stairs, which will ease many a

heart around the University.

Common Sense

Ziskind Questions Republican
Motives on Lincolrfs Birthday  

By “Senator” Ziskind
(Editor’s Note—Need we say that
the Senator orates in behalf of the
Democratic Party?)

Today, among Republican big-
wigs, is a chosen occasion for cele-
bration and speechmaking. It is
Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, the
Enqancip:-1<3;oi', tins humble leader
who walked in silent prayer and
fought to save the Union.

‘Would that these Republicans
echo the thoughts of Lincoln!
‘Would that they repeat his gospel
of charity and helpfulness, of social
betterment and human welfare! For
When, more than now, has the
“world been in need of his healing
‘hand?

But no, instead of the deep social
ph.ilosopl1y of Lincoln, we shall
hear a  rident note of rebuke to
humani‘tai.'i.aii legislation enacted
under President Roosevelt. We
shall hear stretched and forced in-
teijpretations of Lincoln’s utter-
ances to “prove” his closeness to
Republican viewpoint.

Lincoirfs Followers

Senator Taft and Governor
Bricker and Frank Knox will be on
hand’ to quote him at their every
turn—-for, are they not the descend-
ants of the Great Leader who
founded their party? And hence,
are they not the best judges of Lin-
col,n‘s_ pi‘inciples of _ 9;0V€1-"Tlmenpt? 3

I wonder if any politicallvpafty
has 3, monopoly on Abraham Lin-
coln," especially the Republican
Party. I wonder what Lincoln
would think if he were to find his
“‘descendant-st" kniﬁng Wage.-and-
gmmir 1ie_gis‘lation, demanding a bal-
anced dhudget which, if carried,-

would l'leav'e untold 'suffering and ‘

starvation in its wake, hand Dick-
ﬁng caiididates on the basis of will-
ingness to obey Overlords and self-
cbosen bosses.

I wonder if he, who spoke the
words of “malice toward none and
charity for all.” would crowd around
the rostrum of privileged wealth and

vested interest, and decry govern-
ment help for the weak and desti-
tute. Or would he be conniving
with the National Manufacturers’
Association to cut the heart out of
a labor bill which, for the first
time in United States history, le-
galized labor’s right to bargain on
terms of equality with employer?

‘Words Twisted’

Oh no, Abraham, we know you
too well for men to pervert your
being, We see you as the man who
“drove the keen ax to the root of
wrong clearing a free way for the
feet of God.” We see you, bur-

dened by the weight of war, giving _

solace and tender handshake to

your wounded as well as the enemy

wounded.

We see you at Gettysburg speak-
ing the immortal words which the
“world will little note or long re-
member.” We see you as the ﬁrst
President to impose an income tax
that the rich, too, might carry the
cost of war. ’ .

We see you among the common
people, preaching the need for gov-
ernment. reform, telling them of
their right to “alter or overthrow”
their government, of their inalien-

able privilege to share in America’s’l'

riches.

Teachings, Principles

This is you, Abe.
no skilled manipulator of words, no
matter how eloquent he may wax
or how sonorous he may sound, can
misdirect your true self. Yours is
the one indestructible character
against which men may chisel with
overwhelming ferocity but to find
it unmarred and unblemished.

When we go to Wash-in'gton' and
see your statue, your bronzed and
brooding face, your long, lanky and
sinewy body, we are in your hushed
midst, and we gain renewed inspi-
ration of your teachings and un-
yielding principles. As long as
America is free to look into your
honest and open face, the principles
for which you stood can never die!

Investigator Advises Average
Student to Attend Classes If . . .

CHICAGO, I1l.——(ACP)--Are you
just an average student, or one
whose grades are below “C?” If so,
you had better go to class.

Are you in the upper twenty—ﬁve
per cent of the grade bracket? If
so, it doesn’t make much difference
whether you go to class or not,
you’ll be likely to pull down “A’s”
and “B’s” just the same.

This” is not mere aavice. It is
statistical information compiled by
assistants of Dean Aaron J. Brum-
baugh-—of the University bf Chi-
cago from the records of college
students, 204 of whom had taken
“R’s” in one or more survey courses,
and an equal number of. whom had
done the work in the course. An
“R” grade indicates a student took
the course but not the ﬁnal exam-
ination.

The statistics also proved that
universty _women don’t get as good
grades in the college as men. Dean
Brumbaugh said that one possible
answer might be that they partici-
pate more in extra—curricular ac-
tivities than men do. He didn’t
offer other possible explanations.
vey also revealed that there wasn’t
a signiﬁcant difference in the grades

Miss Rush, who is admittedly
strongly behind the move, declared
that it is unreasonable to believe

that it will l«:eep_so1;ority-women out . .

own merit,” she believes. .

Asked if she expected the oppos-

the proposal, Miss Bush said, “I
really think they will, because the
idea is compelling. Of course,
nothing comes all at once. Eventu-
ally they will be unable to resist

The move toward clean politics in
college sororities is nation-wide, the
assistant dean of women explained.
“Every l\/Iortar Board organization
throughout the nation has been

asked to work against the negative .

Dean Brumbaugh’s reason for
publishing the survey was ‘so stu-

was not advocating that students
go to classes if they didn’t want to.
He promised that no action to make
them go would be taken, but he said
that students should at least know

what the effects of their action
would be.

Polar Bears,
Coldspots Win
Frosh Openers

Competition began in the fresh-
man “Polar” basketball league last
Friday with two games taking place.
In the ﬁrst game captain Spartz’s
Coldspots downed Frazier’s Pen-
guins, 36-28, the nightcap going to
Lohmeyer’s Polar Bears over Art-
man’s Snowﬂakes, 32-28.

Allcorn starred for the Coldspots
in the ﬁrst game, taking scoring
honors with 14 points. Spartz and
Malloy also showed a ﬁne brand of
performance although neither did
much scoring. Dolphie l.ed the Pen-
guins, bagging nine points. Fine
form was also shown by Lewis and
Frazier.

The Snowﬂakes lost a tough one
by four points with one of their
star players, Swacus, unable to play.
In this game Artman of the Snow-
ﬂakes and Silverman of the Polar
Bears each scored 11 points.

Lohmeyer, Leonard, and West-
lake played ﬁne ball for the Polar
Bears while Cook and Lanz showed
well with the Snowﬂakes.

The victorious Polar Bears will
try to keep clicking against the un-
tested Seals tomorrow at the Sta-
dium at 4:30. At 3:30 the Snow-
ﬂakes will try to take their ven-
geance out on the Defrosters who

following New Year’s day. He held
a first team, berth in 1937, as run-
ning mate to All-American Mar-
shall Goldberg. Together, they
aided the Pitt cause in no small
manner in capturing the mythical
national title.

As a member of the “dream
backﬁeld” in 1937, he helped mark
the end of a great era in Pitt foot-
ball. I It was during this season that
Curly made the longest kick-off
runback in Pitt history, a 97-yard
sprint through the Carnegie Tech
team.

Last fall Stebbins served as back-
ﬁeld coach at the University of Flor-
ida. His colleagues were Josh Wil-
liams and Mike Milligan, both for-
mer Pitt coaches and players. He
reports to practice late in March
after completing his mentorship at
Florida, succeeding Mike Nicksick
as backﬁeld coach.

Replaces Raskewski

Richards, guard on the 1935-37
teams, never quite attained the
heights his capabilities promised,

but he made the traveling‘ squad V

during his three-year tenure at Pitt.
He was also on the 1937 Rose Bowl
squad.

He relieves Walter Raskowski;
guard coach last season who grad-
uates from Dental School in 1941.

In addition to pigskin tutoring, he ‘

will have full time work in the in-
tramural department.

Richards will assume his new du-
ties March 1, leaving Kingston, Pa.,
high school. There his 1939 team
won the Wyoming Valley confer-
ence title in his second season as
headman. ‘ -

Hoel, a tackle on 1932-34 Pitt
teams, played on the first team line
his junior and senior years, when
powerful Pitt squads had undefeat-

juggernauts. He also was on the
ill-fated Rose Bowl expedition of
January 1, 1933.

in Dick Cassiano, Frank Goodell,

and Tom Holloran. ’l\/Iannion, Her-

intra- ,

ron, and Glenn make up the rest of

Carlson Speaks
At Conference

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Student Health Service, and coach
of the University’s basketball team,
will present a paper entitled
“Health Education,” tomorrow eve-
ning at 8 o’clock before the West-
ern Pennsylvania branch of the Na-
tional Health, Physical Education,
and Recreational Directors’ society
in the auditorium of Frick school.

Stressing “Athletics and Health,”
Dr. Carlson’s discussion will be cen-
tered on exercise and competitive
sports in regard to “the series of
mental, physical, and social adjust-
ments that we know as health.”

Devoting a part of his paper to
a history of competitive intercol-
legiate athletics, Dr. Carlson will
describe the part athletics has play-
ed ‘in fostering physical health,
along with mental and social well-
being. “Athletics,” reads one por-
tion of the paper, “since its modern
inception in the 1820’s at Amherst,
has had as its primary motivation,
health, and since that time, ath-
letics has become symbolic of phys-

, ical health.”

Other topics which Dr. Carlson
will discuss are: “Air,” “Food,”
“Health and Time Budgets,”_ and
“Action.”

According to Herman J. Bearzi,
Ed40. president of the Physical Ed-
ucation club, all members of the
club and all physical education ma-
jors will attend the conference.

If the University were to announce that all student publi-
cations cease, the student body would be quick to rise and
protest. Student publications here at Pitt, just as anywhere
in America,~are dependent on the students themselves. They

i must edit, they read and they support.

The success of student publicatio~ns_, ﬁnancially, direct-
ly depends upon the students. The money paid by thenstu-I I
dent for his copies is triﬂing compared to the cost of running 
the individual» magazine. or newspaper. The" important

source of revenue comes from advertising, national and local.

— Local merchants are always willingand ready to adver- »
tise as long as they feel their advertisements are being ob-
served, and acted upon. Why not make it a habit of reading
the advertising sections of your publications, as well as look-
ing into the services and products of the advertiser? If
their products and services are inferior, tell us . . . if they

are satisfactory, patronize them.

lAft«er,_all, ‘these mercliant-advertisers enable the editors V

of your publications to give you better publications.

Fraternities to Stage

A varied program of tea dances,

scheduled for the three-day period,
announces James Kennedy, C40.
president of Interfraternity Council.

Rushing rules for the second se-
mester stipulate that no rushee

With the close of the rushing pe-
riod at 2 o’clock Sunday morning.

ary 21, 5 o’clock. During this time
all fraternity members and pledges
are restricted from communicating,
directly or indirectly with any
rushee.

Preferential bid lists must be
submitted before 9:30 o’clock Mon-
day morning to the oﬁice of the
dean of men which will issue the
invitations as soon as possible. At

Group Defines
‘Faculty M an’

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.——(ACP)——-
. At the annual meeting here of
the Association of American Col-
leges, delegates voted in favor of a
special report which said:

“The college or university teach-
er is a citizen, a member of a learn-
ed profession, and an officer of an
educational institution. When he
speaks orwrites as a citizen, he
should be free from institutional
censorship or discipline, but his spe-
cial position in the community im-
poses special obligations.

“As a man of learning and an ed-
ucational ofﬁcer, he should remem-
ber that the public may judge his
profession and his institution by his
utterances. Hence he should at all
times be accurate, should exercise
appropriate restraint, should show
respect for the opinions of others,
and should make every effort to in-
dicate that he is not an institutional
spokesman.

In the section of the report de-/

voted to academic freedom, the spe-
cial committee said: “The teacher is
entitled to freedom in the classroom
in discussing his subject, but he
should be careful not to introduce
into his teaching controversial mat-
ter which has no relation to the
subject. Limitations of academic
freedom because of religious or
other aims of the institution should
be clearly stated in writing at the
time of the appointment of a fac-
ulty member.”

Latest Dental Rays Notes 18th Century
Remedies, Danger of ‘Iodine-'I‘l1erapy’

“All brushing of the teeth is dan-
gerous and unless it is performed
with the greatest of care, does mis-
chief.”

Such was the advice given during
the eighteenth-century on the
causes of toothache. This informa-
tion appears in the January issue of
Dental Rays, ofﬁcial publication of
the undergraduates and alumni of
the School of Dentistry.

The application of “blistering
plasters between the shoulder blades
and behind the ears” was recom-
mended to those who suffered. A
simpler remedy suggested was
merely to ﬁll the cavity with “lead
or any other substance that will
stick in the hollow.”

In an article on “The Danger of
Iodine-Therapy in Dentistry” Dr.
Alexander Klein, D41, who was an
associate professor at the Univer-
sity of Vienna before coming to
this country, explains that the
smallest amount of iodine can cause
serious disease if not used with ex-
treme care.

The publication also features a
collection of letters of Dr. Horace

Wells, well—known nineteenth-cen-
tury scientist, and his wife. The
l.etters relate the courtship of Wells
and the controversy among Morton,
Jackson, and Wells over the right
to be called the discoverer of anaes-
thesia.

Religious Week

Continued from page one
deﬁnite answer to the question
“Why Religion?”

“In times of crises,” Dr. Franklin
declared, “it is much easier to get
groups of students to discuss re-
ligion, and at the present time this
seems to be the underlying cause of
numerous religious gatherings.

“Religious Emphasis Week does
not necessarily mean that during
this week only are students to think
of religion, but this is time set
aside for special consideration of re-
ligion and what it means to them,”
he explained.

In elaborating on the idea of
crises turning man to closer con-
sideration of religion, Dr. Franklin
said that recently the board of di-
rectors of Pittsburgh‘s public
schools had approved a plan of of-
fering a free elective course of not
more than two credits for religious
education to high school students.
