Senate
Appropriations
Committee aims to
restore Pitt fimeiing

W By Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

The Republican—cont’rolled
Pennsylvania Senate Appropria-
tions Committee voted unani-
mously on Tuesday to maintain
Pitt’s state funding at $136.1
million for the next ﬁscal year,
despite Gov. Tom Corbett’s pro-
posed 3o percent cut.

In February, Corbett pro-
posed a 30 percent slash to
three of the four state-related
Universities-— Pitt, Penn State
and Temple. Lincoln, by far the
smallest of the four state—relat—
ed schools, was to be spared.
However, the cuts did not re-
ceive support in the General As-
sembly, as even the committee
members of the governor’s own
party voted not to cut funding
from higher education.

While the ranking Republican
in the Senate Appropriations
Committee, Sen. Jake Corman
(R—Centre), was not available for
immediate comment, he previ-
ously voiced his opposition to
the cuts.

‘ “I’m going to do my best to
not have anylcuts [to higher edu-
cation] this year,” Corman said
in _Feburary.

This is just the first step in
the budget process. The state
senate will _vote on the budget
on Wednesday, and the commit-
tee’s budget "must. also pass in
the House before the governor

  Pitt combines branch campus functions

Byjoe Chilson
Staff Writer

Staring down even deeper potential
cuts to state funding in the coming
year, Pittwill combine administrative
duties this week at two of its branch
campuses —<Pitt Bradford and Pitt
Titusville.

According to a press release is-
sued by the University on Monday,
effective this week, Pitt Bradford
President Livingston Alexanderwill
also assume administrative control of
the Titusville campus. Major adrnin-
istrative functions for the two cam-
puseswillbe centralized at Bradford.
The University press release said the
administrative synthesis is one part
of a larger strategy of cost-cutting
measures Pitt is taking in the face of
dwindling state support.

David Fritz, the vice president of
Academic Affairs at Titusville, will
become interim campus dean for the
Titusville campus, responsible for
day-to-day operations and reporting

directly to Alexander.

Pitt Provost and Senior Vice
Chancellor Patricia Beeson said the
administrative shift would realign
only back-office operations at Titus-
ville and leave academic operations
unaffected.

“I don’t anticipate that this will
have an effect on the day-to-day lives
of students at Titusville,’? Beeson said.

Alexander said thatthe shift of ad-

rninistrative policies has three main .

goals: to reduce the operating cost of
Pitt Titusville, to assess the viability of
the Titusville campus and to continue
offering educational opportunities in
the Titusville area. V

Monday’s press release said that
the impetus for the administrative
changes at Titusville was the recent
cuts to Pitt’s state funding.

In her announcement of the

, changeinpolicy, Beeson said, “As the

result of unprecedented cuts from

‘ our Commonwealth appropriation

this year and a proposal for further
cuts inthe comingyear,we have been

forced to examine areas of previous
commitment, including our historic

' commitment to bring education to

various regions and populations of
western Pennsylvania.”

Pitt suffered a 19 percent reduc- ’

tion in its general appropriation
and a 50 percent cut to its academic
medical center appropriations this

academic’ year. Thestate budget

proposed by Gov. Tom Corbett for
the next ﬁscal yearwould cut general
appropriations by 30 percent and
academic medical center appropria-
tions by another 10 percent. Adjusted
for inﬂation, such reductions would
bring Pitt to its lowest level of state
support since itbecame a public uni-
versity in the 1960s.

Alexander said he could not com-
ment on other cost-cutting measures
the University would be implement-
ing at Titusville and Bradford as they
will result from “ongoing discussions
with the staff and faculty at both cam-

Nor could Alexander specify how many ad-
ministrative jobs would be cut as part of this
new policy. However, he said that among other
cost—cuttingmeasures, the Universitywill imple-
ment avoluntary early retirement program that
would lead to a reduction in staff at Titusville
and other Pitt locations.

Beeson later elaborated that if suﬂicientstaﬁ'
does not choose to take part in early retirement,
layoffs might be required to reduce staff.

Titusville became a branch campus along
with Bradford and Greensburg in 1963. It is a
two—year institution and currently serves about
500 ﬁill-time students and provides access to
more than 100 majors and pre-professional
tracks. In April of this year, Titusville awarded
degrees to 80 students —— the largest graduat-
ing class inthe branch campus’ 49-year history.

As of now, there are noﬁrrnplans forﬁirther
changes at the Titusville campus besides the
administrative realignment and implementa-
tion of a voluntary early retirement program.

“There is no intent to close the Pitt Titusville
campus; nor is it our intentto combine the cam-
puses,” Alexander said in an email. I

budgets have been passed late in the past.

Sen. Jay Costa (D-Pittsburgh), whose
district includes the University’s Oak-
land campus, believes the budget will pass
without cuts to higher education.

“It is a very solid starting point,”, Costa
said, referring to the level of Pitt’s' fund-
ing being sent through the Senate and the
House for deliberation. “It’s a fair and
respectable number.”

Costa said Corbett’s proposed 3o-per-
cent budget cut to Pitt was “unwarranted”
and that the revenue number on which the
governor based his budget was lower than
the actual number. Costa said the origi-
nal budget was based on a $718 million
deﬁcit, but the current deficit is actually
around $300 million.

Corbett was unavailable for comment.

Costa said part of the understanding is
that the University must keep its tuition
increases in line with standard rates of
inﬂation. I

Pitt spokesman says FBI leading bomb threat investigation

The Pitt News Staff

For the ﬁrst time since a series of bomb
threats emptied out Pitt buildings more
than 140 times, the University has said it
is not taking the lead in the investigation.

Pitt spokesman Robert ‘Hill said in an
email that the FBI is in charge of the follow-
up investigation, the ﬁrst time either the
University or the FBI has stated who holds
the primary role in continuing to investigate
the case. Hill declined further comment,
however, and the FBI did not return multiple
requests for comment.

“Because the FBI is in charge of the in-
vestigation, I am able to provide you with
neither update nor comment,” Hill said in

I the email.

Other investigators also declined to say
much but did state that the investigation
is not over. .

Pitt police, who participated in bomb-
threat sweeps of threatened buildings, have
indicated they will continue to contribute
to the investigation.

“I would like to contribute [comment
on the state of the investigation] at some
point, but we are not at that point since
there is very active investigation ongoing,”
Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney said in an
email. “What I can say is we continue to

:onumvro ‘ .

investigate the threats vigorously.”

The threats began on Feb. 13, when a
threat was found written in a bathroom
stall in Chevron Science Center. The threats
continued coming primarily through emails
to University officials and local news outlets
through April 20, when a group claiming
responsibility for the threats sent an email
to The Pitt News claiming it would stop

the threats if the University dropped the .

$50,000 dollar reward it had offered for
details leading to an arrest in the case. The
University dropped the reward on April 21,
and no subsequent threats have been made.
In recent ‘weeks, the investigation has
resulted in the conﬁscation of a computer
server believed to have been used by the
bomb threateners to relay their messages.
According to the Pittsburgh Post-_Ga-
zette, last week authorities returned the
conﬁscated server to May Day/FirstLink,
a New York—based server hosting service.
Though owned by ‘May Day/FirstLink, the
server was operated by an Italian-based
provider, European Counter Network, that
allows users to send anonymous emails;
The investigation surrounding persons
of interest Seamus Johnston and Katherine

Anne McClosky, a transgender couple from ,

Johnstown, also continues. Johnston was
‘formally a student at Pitt Johnstown. The
FBI returned conﬁscated computer equip-
ment and other materials to Johnston and

McClosky sometime last week.

On April 18, McC-losky and Johnston
ﬁrst appeared before a federal grand jury
in Allegheny County andjudge Nora Barry
Fistcher. They will appear before the judge
again on May 22.

Johnston and McClosky both maintain
their innocence. ‘

“I do not know what the go_vernment’s
intentions are. Iwasn’t involved. Very sim-
ple,”Johnston said.

The couple contendthat the continued
pressure from law enforcement might have
resulted from charges Johnston is pressing
against the University. ’

Jerome Cochran, Pitt’s executive vice
chancellor and a member of the Office of
General Counsel of the University, previous-

_ly conﬁrmed that, in November, Johnston

was arrested for and charged with indecent
exposure, deﬁant trespass and disorderly
conduct after he showered and changed

' in a men’s locker room on the Johnstown

branch campus. That situation resulted in
Johnston’s explusion. J ’

Last month, the former Pitt student ﬁled
a complaint against the University with the
Pittsburgh Commission on Human Rela-
tions. Pitt is expected to respond to the
complaint by May 17.

“I believe that if Pitt administration
doesn’t care about illegalretaliation in one

form (my expulsion and criminal charges),

   

they probably don’t care about doing it.in
another way (using our government during
a terrorist investigation),” Johnston said
in an email-. V '

Judge Fischer’s chamber declined to
comment.

While the investigation continues, the
visibly heightened security measures en-
acted on campus during the bomb threats
have ceased.

In response to the series of threats, the
University placed security checkpoints at
campus building entrances starting on April
8. Guards would check bags and require
valid Pitt IDs for entrance. There were also
a limited number of open entrances and
restricted access at many campus buildings.

About a week after the most recent bomb
threat, the visible security measures van-
ished at many buildings, including the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, the Cathedral of Learning,
Alumni Hall and Hillman Library.

“The successful, intense and less—dis—
ruptive safety and security measures that
were established for the week of ﬁnals con-
tinue to be in place,” Hill said in an email
last week.

When speciﬁcally asked about the vis-
ible removal of security checkpoints, Hill
said, “The University does [not] wish to
give details of this phase of the enhanced
security to avoid compromising it; thus, I

have no additional commen .” ﬂ,

nity, including the judiciary, legal employers and
bar associations.

Carter said he also hopes to increase diver-
sity inthe law school among both faculty and the
student body.

S Some members of the Pitt Law community
see Cartet’s hiring as a progressive step for the
law school on this front.

“I’m excited because he’s black,” Pitt law stu-
dentjennifer Saint—Preux said. “I think it marks
a goodtime interms ofPitt law school branching
out in terms of diversity.’ ’

Carter similarly sees his appointment as a
0 ositive reﬂection on the University’s o o enness. .

   

“I certainly think it’s an honor, and I hope it
will project a statement about the commitment
ofPitt’s law school to equal opportunity,” he said.

Carter was selected ﬁom a pool of 40 appli-
cantstoassume the deanship;Ase1ection commit-
tee consisting oflaw school faculty, staff, students
and related associates lowered the number of
candidates for the position to 10 and put those
applicants through two rigorous rounds of in-
terviews.

“It was a very long and thoughtful process,” .

said Linda Tashbook, the law school’s staff repre-

sentative on the dean search committee.
Tashbook said it was Carter’s overwhelming

enthusiasm for the o osition that sethim apart.

  

    

When Carter entered his ﬁrst interview with
the selection committee, he brought in a copy of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that contained an
article aboutthe law school’s new Innovation Prac-
tice Institute. Accordingto a recent Pitt Chronicle
article, the Innovation Practice Institute trains
lawyerstobe effective counselors inbusiness, but
particularlyininnovation——start—ups, early—stage
ventures and innovation spin—offs. The institutes
aim is to integrate the innovation culture into the

' study and practice of law. ~ -

“He told us, ‘IfIwas dean, this articlewould be
in The Washington Post, The New York Times,”’
Tashbook said. “We loved his energy andhis quick
ideas. He wanted to be our advocate, to yell our

message from the rooftops.”

Tashbook said when looking for the next
law school dean, the search committee wanted
someone who desired not just any deanship, but
speciﬁcally the Pitt deanship.

Carter said that was his intention when ap-
plying _

“Pittwas the only [deanship] Iwas really inter-
estedinenoughtopursue,” Cartersaid. “I knew of

-' the scholarship and writing ofthe Pitt: law school

Joanne Epps, the clean at Temple University’s
Beasley School of Law, gave her soon—departing
employee aglowing review. 1

‘‘He’s got a greatwimting smile, and it alwa
seems as if he’s off to some new project,” Epps
said. “He is easygoing and caring about students
and their ﬁxtures.” ‘

Epps saidthat during Carter’s time atTemple,
hewas askedtoleadthe school’shiringeﬁ'orts and
workedwithtite Beasleyfaculty on issues offaculty
development. She added that he demonstrated
effective leadership in those executive roles.

“He’s a great example of someone who is in-
spirational but also practical at the same time,”
she said.

Anothergoalfor Carteristo raisethebarexam

“T1’1ebarpassage rate [forlaw students atPitt]
is above the state average, but it could be better,
and it should be better,” Carter said.

Injuly 2011, 188 Pitt Law students took the
Pennsylvaniabarexarn. Ofthosetest-takers, 82.45
percent passed the exam, according to the Penn-
sylvania Board of Law Examiners. The overall

"passage rate for the Pennsylvania bar exam last

yearwas 79.81 percent.

In comparison, the 244 students from Tem-
ple’s Beasley School of Law who took the exam
produced a passage rate of 88.11 percent, the
second-highest passage rate for any school on

THE STAMATTACK

Dont criticize socialism with unproductive
ranting, instead examine economic effects

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

There’s a song I’ve been hearing a
lot recently.

It’s called “I’m a Socialist,” and
many well-intentioned college stu-
dents sing it.

It isn’t hard to see why the song
is so catchy. The poorest shouldn’t
starve while the rich enjoy fancy
things. Spread the wealth around
and we will have a nice1y-function-
ing country where everybody has
a chance. *

It’s a pleasant song, but it’s
wrong. Yet the typical rebuttal
tune that refutes “I’m a Socialist”
is downright obnoxious.

It is a gnashing, death metal
dump of anger. It begins with ti-

rades against stupid, lazy or enti- _

tled kids failing to take personal re-
sponsibility. Then comes screams
about liberty and rights. You give a
homeless person a doughnut, and
soon he will ride off with your wife
and a fattened ox. Accusations of
class warfare abound.

This rebuttal has had very lit-
tle impact on changing opinions.
Most college-aged adults now hold
more positive views toward social-
ism than capitalism, according to

the Pew Research Center. Yelling
about rights and class wars hasn’t
changed things.

This is because very few people
have actual distaste toward the
rich. College campuses are not
breeding grounds for revolution-
aries ‘—- you’d be hard-pressed to
ﬁnd a poster of Lenin on a dorm
wall. Very few want a revolution.
They just want the rich to pay more
and don’t think that will lead to a
weaker economy. .

It satisﬁes a key truth for many:
that fairis better than not fair. This
key appeal to socialism is not ad-
dressed at all by the blathering.

So to all the defenders of capi-
talism, it is time we recognize that
this concern must bedirectly ad-
dressed. Stop making the social-
ism/capitalism debate about rights

and your ability to begreedy. Also, V

stop trying to say that making the
rich pay ﬁve cents more on the dol-
lar will cause them to shut down
their factories and shops, leading
to depression, regardless of how
true these concerns are. After all,
we don’t need to say these things to
criticize socialism. All we need to
criticize is how socialism distorts
the natural economy with unex-
pected side effects.

If that line doesn’t have enough
kick, socialism fails because when
you introduce rabbits to the Aus-
tralian outback, they might end up
causing massive soil erosion.

If -that analogy was unfamil-
iar to you, socialism fails because
a central political authority will

Stop making

capitalism “

rights and your
abi|ity_to be
greedy.

mess up if tasked with deciding
where money goes in a system as
complicated as the U.S. economy.
The country is just too big to
understand. A CEO or mayor can
sometimes centrally plan —— their
systems have fewer players and
more uniﬁed goals. But in an econ-
omy with billions of transactions a
day, involving occupations ranging
from priest to gondolier, there are
too many interactions to manage.
Interventions have the possibil-
ity of drastic, second-hand side
effects that in the long run make
everybody less happy and often
less equal. » _
Consider two of the most social-
ist programs in the country today,"

. Social Security and Medicare. Both

represent mild forms of socialism;
while not radical in their redistri-

bution, they are both cases of the

young, according to their abilities,
transferring to the elderly, accord-
ing to their needs.

To the blathering capitalism
defenders, this has not led us to
a society of lazy elderly people.
Ezra from Bethesda and Mabel
from Mobile are actually more
likely to be working today than in
the 19605, when these programs
really started revving up. Plus, So-
cial Security has led to a dramatic
decrease in senior citizen poverty
rates.

But despite all these positives,
this is not a victory for socialist
thinking. New work by economists
Evans, Kotlikoff, and Phillips sug-
gests these programs have dramat-
ically lowered the savings rate of
the young. It makes sense: in your
thirties, there is less urgency to
save with these programs for your
seventies. ,

This is the kind of unexpected
side effect that socialism causes,
one that has deeply impacted to-
day’s world. This saving drop since
the 1960s led to a drop in national
saving, which equated to a ﬁvefold
drop in domestic investment over
‘the same period. '

The “So what?” of this is that
domestic investment leads to real
productivity growth, which leads
to increasing real wages. A per-
fectly decent social program may
be partially to blame for the stagna-
tion of your incomes —- an effect
felt more deeply by the working
class, who rely on_wages rather

than investments for income. So- ’

cial Security may increase income
inequalities. ‘

Look at what is not mentioned:
Nobody suddenly became lazy,
nobody took your guns away, and
nobody took away your freedom.
Instead, a large government pro-
gram with good intentions may
have lead to far worse side effects
on the other side. ’ P

This song is certainly more nu-
anced than blathering about rights,
but that is the real reason why “I’m
a Socialist’-’ is a ﬂawed tune, and
one that actually addresses legiti-

- mate concerns without calling any-

body“_a stupid, ignorant fool. I

Bromance with the best of them: A guide to a successful bro-date

By Andrew Kaback

I went out for dinner with a male friend

. can be kind of like trying to take a trip on

the Titanic without James Cameron: cold
terror with no romance or proﬁtability. In

' fact, the only thing I would dislike more

than going on an unprepped bro—date is
having to sit through “Titanic 3D” for $13. —
I guess that there are more awkward
things than a bro-date: realizing your best

geous amounts of pizza), it’s just that I
can’t stand the process.

For example, paying the bill at a dinner.

with girls; here’s the game that everyone
knows you’re supposed to play:

Guy: “Oh, let me take care of this.”

Girl: “_No, at least let me pay for half.”

Guy (with cheesy smile): “Please, this
one is on me.”

But paying for bro—dates is the most
uncomfortable thirty seconds life has to
offer, outside of strep throat checkups.

There’s nothing to say in that moment.

is that ﬁnding yourself on a bro—date is
like listening to Motion City Soundtrack
after eighth grade and realizing everything
that was wrong with you when you once
thought they “really understood your life.”

Let me be clear. I am a major fan of
having a core group of bros. If they were
an NHL team in the playoffs, I would re-
sist cutting my beard for them, or as in
Sidney Crosby’s case, my prepubescent
peach fuzz. It’s not that I don’t like what

FROM PAGE 6

But you can’t say that. That’s not how
the bro game works. After that pause,
where every guy thinks the exact same
thing, comes the inevitable reaching out
of the arm. The clasping of the check. The
reach to the wallet. And the ﬁnal, gut-
wrenching, insertion of the credit card.
The tragic hero ruins his credit score at
the expense of bros again.

So what is the solution to the bromanc—
ing crisis? Simple. In my experience, there

are a number of tips that I have learned 2

and will share with you. You may think
they sound meaningless or unnecessary,
but all of these items have been known to
destroy a ﬁne evening.

1) Ask if he’s a vegan. Many will say
that this is unethical as it will inevitably
lead to a potential “Sorry, I can’t make
dinner and I’m busy pretty deep into next
year” if he says yes. But beware, failure to
know will lead to almost certain disaster.
There’s nothing worse than planning a
barbecue worthy of Ron Swanson only to
ﬁnd out that he thinkskilling animals “is
kind of messed up, man.” Upon asking, _use
a website or guidebook to pick a place to
eat. I know it’s tempting to think of a place

on your own, but have you ever actually
tried seitan?

2) Drive. If you do nothing else correct
in your entire bromancing experience,
please be the driver. The point is that
driving in Pittsburgh is widely regarded
as the third most stressful experience of
most people’s lives behind not knowing
what you want at Chipotle and deciding
between deal or no deal. Take this into
your own hands! If “Law 8: Order” has
taught me anything, it is that the driver
always gets away.

3) Sports and Cars. Honestly, stick to
them! Last time I tried to talk politics with
a bro we got into an in-depth debate over
whether Dennis Kucinich or Joe Biden
would be a better wingman at a poetry
reading. Sports are the best for conversa-
tion because, no matter what,Jim Thome
and Mario Lemieux will come up. Just learn
two or three of their statistics, and you
are literally set for hours. Steer clear of
anything that can’t be explained by the
sentence: “He’s got a couple more miles
left in him.”

So if you’re on the fence about start-
ing a bromance, I understand. I’ve been
there, and you are completely justiﬁed in
being scared. Nobody can predict what’s
going to happen in the future of your bro-
dates. But if you follow these simple tips,
I’m conﬁdent that you will be one—upping

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

After reading the article “Threats ﬁnished
at Pitt, email claims,” in the Post-Gazette
April 23, 2012, I ﬁnd myself infuriated.

How dare “The Treateners,” as this
group of terrorists call themselves, com-
plain about a reward posted for a crime
(yes, inducing panic is a crime) as if what
they did was not wrong? They stated in an
email to the University:

“This all began when you, Nordenberg,
put out a $10,000 — then $50,000 ‘re-

ward’ (bounty) for some young kid who’d '

pranked the University. Remember?” the
letter states. “That REALLY angered us!

our kids like that!” .

What about the way you have treated
my kid.’ She has been evacuated from
classes and her dorm at all hours, mak-
ing it difﬁcult to concentrate and do well
in class. Not to mention the money we"
spend for her education and living ar-
rangements. My husband and I also had
to pay for a hotel room so she could sleep
before a major test she had to take. I, and
I’m sure many other students and parents,
say, “This is America, how dare you treat
my child this way?”

Respectfully,

PREVIEW

  Film festival promotes  education  political topics

By Anna Weldon
A8'E Editor

The Silk Screen Asian American
Film Festival

Pull box:

When: May 11 to 20

Where: Harris Theater, Regent
Square and Melwood Screening
Room

Cost: Ticket prices vary, group
pricing available
www.silkscreenfestival.org

Incorporating ﬁlms from all across
Asia, the Silk Screen Asian-Ameri-
can Film Festival does not exclude
any part of the vast continent in its
selection process. E .

The festival will kick off its sev-
enth season of movie screenings
on Friday, May 11, with an open-
ing night ﬁlm and gala at the Har-
ris Theater and Rivers Club. The
event, which will run for 10 days,
will feature 25 different ﬁlms and
48 screenings.

The event seeks to promote

cross-cultural understanding‘

and diversity through the arts and
through ﬁlm. Katiejones, the op-
erations manager for the festival,
believes that international ﬁlm is
a window to the other side of the

world.

The festival deﬁnes Asia as a
region that extends from Turkey
to Japan. Unlike other events, the
Silk Screen Asian-American Film
Festival chooses to include each
section of the continent. The fes-
tival includes movies from India,
Iraq andjapan among many other

countries in Asia.

Jones explained that the festi-
val attempts “to help [audiences]
appreciate other cultures of the
world.” a

“The Lady,” the ﬁlm that will
open the festival, follows the life

and hardships of Aung San Suu ‘

Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize

winner and activist for democracy
in Burma. The ﬁlm, directedby

Luc Besson, addresses a contro-
, versial issue that has surfaced in

the ‘news recently —— Suu Kyi and
her involvement in the change in
the Burmese government.

Suu Kyi, whom Michelle Yeoh
will portray in the ﬁlm, has re-

— ceived international attention

for her political efforts recently,
but the festival’s programmers
began to look into the ﬁlm even
before her rise in publicity. Aseem
Chhabra, a ﬁlm expert and the
festival’s programming director
of two years, explained that the

committee of ﬁlm selectorshas
_been interested in the ﬁlm since

early this year.

Because of their popularity,
ﬁlms such as'i“The Lady” are rela-
tively big—budget ﬁlms for the fes-
tival, Chhabra said. More expen-
sive ﬁlms take about three to four
months to get on the screening
list, but if the committee of ﬁlm
selectors feels strongly about a

particular movie, it will work hard

to screen it. v _ _

Burton adapts soap oper‘D hadows’ into a plotless movie

- Byjeff Ihaza
Staﬁ Writer

“Dark Shadows”

Directed by: Tim Burton
Starring: johnny Depp, Chloe
Grace Moretz, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Helena Bonham Carter

Grade: C+

It’s not very often that a soap opera
gets made into a major motion pic-
ture, and perhaps that’s for a good
reason.

Tim Burton’s adaptation of the
late—’60s soap opera “Dark Shad-
ows” relies upon many of the same
plot inconsistencies and confusing
elements that usually compose only
trashy, mid—afternoon television
series.

The ﬁlm stars Johnny Depp as
Barnabas Collins, a wealthy heir to
a ﬁshing company in Maine whose
family fortune is cursed by one of
Barnabas’ mistresses. As a result of
the curse, Barnabas is transformed
into a vampire and locked away for
two centuries before he is discovered
by a group of construction workers
in 1972 —— making for a huge change
in scene from his death inthe 1700s.

Once unearthed, Barnabas makes
it_ a pointto restore his familyfs honor
and prominence in the community.
The present-day Collins family soon
discovers that its strange, distant
relative is a vampire. '

Similar to many soap opera dra-
mas, “Dark Shadows” features a
complex, century—old love triangle

Poe’s ﬁction comesalive inthriller movie ‘The Raven’

By Anna Weldon
A‘8'E Editor,

“The Raven” -

Directed by: James McTeigue

Starring: John Cusack, Luke Evans, Al-
ice Eve

Grade: A-

One man’s horror story turns into another
man’s reality in the recent release “The
Raven,” directed by James McTeigue.

In a ﬁctional adaptation of the life of Ed-
gar Allen Poe (john Cusack), “The Raven”
brings to life the world of Poe’s poems and
short stories, combining it with multiple
elements of classic thriller movies. Set in
Baltimore —— the site of Poe’s grave — the
movie skews the barriers of fantasy and
reality.

“The Raven” begins with a violent mur-

der that replicates one of Poe’s short sto—.

ries: “The Murders in the Rue Morgue.” The

murderer, clearly obsessed with Poe, has

copied every detail of the fictional crime,
mimicking the author’s work perfectly,
Once the plot begins to pick up, itris
clear that Poe is involved more intricately
in the case than he or the investigating

detectives expected. His ﬁancee, Emily
Hamilton (Alice Eve), becomes a central
part of the investigation, and by swear-
ing his love for her, Poe commits himself
to death.

Having gradually gone mad as the situa-
tion developed, Poe’s life ends in the movie
similarly to the way it did in real life —— he’s
found half— dead and unrevivable, without
much awareness of the cause of his demise.

The most appealing aspect of the movie
is its replication of Poe’s work. For those
interested in the 19th-century writer,'the
movie offers a few especially memorable
moments that bring visual components to
his gruesome stories. .

“The Raven” references various work
by Poe, including “The Pit and the Pen-
dulum” and “The Tell—Tale Heart.” The

symbol of the raven serves as an obvious

but satisfying metaphor throughout the
movie, shadowing the death of the charac-
ters in a role that’s similar to its symbolic
function in the poem.

Other stories contribute to the murder ,

scenes on a more vivid level, and in certain
humorous moments, the police force dem-
onstrates its obvious disgust for the inner
workings of Poe’s mind by expressing their

that helps to complicate the ﬁlm’s plot. But
rather than enhance the storyline, the added
complications of its romantic component only
cause “Dark Shadows” to lose some consider-
able plot depth.

Like a lot of Burton’s recent work, “Dark

Shadows” nearly makes up for what it lacks in
substance with stunningly vivid visual_ effects.
The characters all have a dark, Halloweenesque
glow that ﬁts the movie’s atmosphere perfectly.

As a frequent Burton collaborator, Depp
does what he does in every quirky Burton ﬁlm,
and does a good job at it.‘ He transforms into
Barnabas, who expectedly ﬁts the style of role
that Depp has played in past ﬁlms. As annoy-
ing as it is to be pummeled continuously by the
same character, Depp has perfected the role of
the suange, unearthly misﬁt.

The ﬁlm’s other actors all put in stellar per-

formances in hopes of savingthe woefully hole— .
' ridden plot. The 15-year-old Carolyn Stoddard,

played by Chloe Moretz, contributes a number
ofhilarious ’7os-teen-angst moments, including
an interesting performance with Alice Cooper.

visceral reactions.
But “The Raven” brings a certain super-
natural element in its delivery. The movie

is riddled with ﬁctional stories, but still

contains factual information about Poe’s

life. His place and year of death, his bel- '

ligerency and his overall persona all were
based on recorded fact.

The line between fact and ﬁction in the
film does not become blurred enough for
the audience to doubt history and fall na-
ively into the plot of the movie. It does,
however, force the viewer to realize Poe’s
mad potential in his work and how bril-
liantly horriﬁc many of his stories actu-
ally are.

Though not overly gory, “The Raven”
does have a few bloody moments that could
leave weak-stomached viewers unsettled.
For the most part, the movie sticks to the
typical plot of a thriller, taking the. audi-
ence on twists throughout 19th century
Baltimore to ﬁnd a madman who lives vi-
cariously through Poe’s literature.-

For literary geeks who want to watch a
visual replication of this American writer’s
work or horror fans that like the violence
and mystery of a thriller movie, “The Ra-
ven” offers a darkly perceptive view of the
famous writer, placing viewers in the midst
of accounts of murders that circle around
the beloved author.

this woman,” Chhabra said about Suu Kyi’s
story. I -

The movie proﬁles the life of the politi-
cal activist, exposing certain personal ele-
ments of her life and giving details about
her relationship with her husband. Chhabra
believes this movie is important because it
helps Americans to understand the leader’s
background. A .

Suu Kyi was the general secretary of the
National League for Democracy party in
Burma, which was founded in 1988. While
holding that position, Suu Kyi was put under
housearrest for six years for campaigning to
change the government from a military junta
to a democracy. She wasreleased in 1995,
and on May 2, 2012, became an officially
elected member of the Burmese parliament,
which dissolved its military junta in 2011 in
favor of a nominally civilian government.

Hallie Johnson, the events and opera-
tions coordinator of the ﬁlm festival, agreed
that “The Lady” has generated interest and
will be a good movie to show a Pittsburgh
audience. , '

, “It has been all over the festival circuit
for the last couple months or so. It’s a timely
movie. It’s relevant,” Johnson said.

The ﬁlm selection process begins im-
mediately after the present festival ends.
Johnson explained that the committee be-

gins the selection process by-researching
ﬁlms. Many of the ﬁlms come from other
ﬁlm festivals, while some ‘come as sugges-
-tions by people in the ﬁlm industry.
The committee selects 100 to 200 works

that it watches and reviews. Each member .

participates in watching the ﬁlms to help
narrow down the list. They negotiate and
continue to pare down the list until they
reach about 25 movies.

Though there isn’t a speciﬁc list of cri-
teria, bothjohnson and Chhabra said they
look for certain qualities in the ﬁlms. Fol-
lowing the mission statement of the Silk
Screen Asian Arts and Culture Organization,
which runs the festival, the committee seeks
to educate the audience and help it to View
ﬁlms about different cultures. Forjohnson,
there are somebasic elements that need
to exist for the ﬁlm to work in the festival.

“Is it watchable? If we can’t getthrough
the ﬁrst 13 minutes, we’re not going to put
our audience through that. Is it relevant to
our mission statement? Will our audience
walk away learning something?” she asked.

if The Silk Screen Asian—American Film
Festival does. not set out to show “commer—

A cial” ﬁlms, but instead attempts to educate
, viewers on the expansive region while aim-
ing to show ﬁlms that the audience will like. .

Chhabra said he searches for these types
of ﬁlms. '

. “When I’m selecting ﬁlms, I select ﬁlms
that I like and what the audience likes,”
he said. “I want to interact with the audi-
ence.” I

Panthers keep Big East Tournament hopes alive

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

After winning two of three games
in a series with_Georgetown two
weeks ago, the Pitt baseball team
repeated the feat last weekend
against Rutgers to recordjust the

V third series victory of its Big East

schedule.

Only eight teams advance'to *

the Big East Tournament in late
May, and the surging Panthers

.have used four wins in their last

six conference games to climb their
way back into contention for a top-
eight ﬁnish. .

Following last weekend’s series
at Rutgers, Pitt is in ninth place,
one game_behind the Villanova
Wildcats.

. The crucial series with the Scar-
let Knights (27-20, 12-9 Big East)
didn’t start the way Pitt (24-22,
8-13 Big East) would have liked.

Rutgers 3, Pitt 1
Seniorpitcher Matt Iannazzo
gave the Panthers a quality start

. in the opening game of the series,

but the offense.failed to provide
him run support as Pitt dropped
a low-scoring contest.

“I mixed my pitches well and
threw quality pitches in hitters’
counts,” Iannazzo said. “Losing
despite a quality start is just part
of the game. I have won many

. games where I haven’t necessarily

deserved it, and I have lost games
where I have'thro'wn very well.?’
The right-hander pitched sev-
en strong innings, allowing two
earned runs and one unearned

run. He struck outﬁve batters and"
- walked none.

In the third inning, Iannazzo
encountered trouble when three
Rutgers singles, coupled with a
throwing error by senior first

baseman Rick Devereaux, gave the .

Scarlet Knights a»3—0 lead.

The Panthers tried to rally
in the seventh inning with three
singles of their own.

Devereaux scored Pitt’s ﬁrst
run when freshman outfielder
Boo Vazquez hit a ball throughthe
left side of the inﬁeld, but Rutgers
pitcher Tyler Gebler ended the
comeback attempt and the contest
by ﬁnishing off a ﬁve-hit complete
game to pick up the win.

Pitts, Rutgers 2

Putting their offensive struggles

in the series opener behind them,
the Panthers didn’t waste time get-
ting on the board in the second
game of the doubleheader.

Sophomore outﬁelder Stephen
Vranka connected on a lead-off
doubleto start the game, and he
scored when Devereaux hit a dou-
ble of his own.

That one-run lead didn’t last
long. The Scarlet Knights scored
a run in both the ﬁrst and third
innings off Pitt sophomore pitcher
Ethan Mildren to take a 2-1 lead,
but those two runs would be all
the team would score in the second
game of the series.

Junior second baseman Evan

Oswald tied the game in the fourth ' '

inning when outﬁelder Mike Doug-
las tripled him home.
Pitt then broke the tie in the

4 next inning. Vranka scored an

unearned run after reaching on
a ﬁelding error, and senior desig-
nated hitter Anthony DeFabio also
scored unearned when junior Sam
Parente singledhim home to give
the Panthers a 4-2 lead.

Vranka also added the ﬁfth run,
scoring on sophomore outﬁelder
Casey Roche’s single.

After recovering from a slow
start, Mildren shut ‘down the
Rutgers offense during his eight
quality innings on the mound. He
struck out four on his way to pick-
ing up the win.

“With my pitching, I have been
having great consistency with all
of my pitches,” he said. “I have felt
comfdrtable each time out and
hope to continue this for the rest
of the season.”

Freshman pitcher Joe Harvey
replaced Mildren in the ninth in-
ning, recording two strikeouts and
earning the save.

.Pitt 4, Rutgers .3

For the third consecutive game,
Rutgers took an early lead when it
scored off Pitt sophomore pitcher
Matt Wotherspoon in the ﬁrst in-
ning of the series-deciding rubber
match. - .

But Pitt responded quickly and
took the lead in the third inning
when both Vranka andDeFabio
connected on doubles and scored.

The Panthers also put together
a two-run inning in the ﬁfth. Par-
ente’s single into left ﬁeld brought

home Vranka and’ sophomore p
~ .shortstop.Derik Wilson as Pitt

stretched its lead 4-1.

Rutgers then narrowed the deﬁ-
cit to two in the sixth inning on a
sacriﬁce ﬂy off Wotherspoon.

Pitt manager Joe Jordano re-
placed Wotherspoon in the next

inning, and his bullpen got out

of several difficult situations —
including_a bases-loaded jam in
the ninth inning -— to secure the
victory.

“We made some big plays in big
situations. Obviously that play. at
the end of the game was huge,”Jor—

dano said of the game-ending dou- .

ble play Pitt used to ﬁnish Rutgers’
hopes of coming back. “You’ve got
the bases loaded with one out and
their best hitter, maybe the best
hitter in the conference, coming
up to the plate. We did a great job
and made a great play.”

Pitt freshmancloser Tanner
Wilt provided the clutch moment
when he got Rutgers slugger Pat-
rick Kivlehan, who leads the Big
East with a .392 batting average,
to hit into the crucial double play.

Jordano also stressed just how
important it was for Pitt to win the

I ﬁnal game of last weekend’s series.

“‘We really needed to win that
ball game and win the series,” he
said. “As we’ve been saying, we’re
in'a must-win situation.‘ There
were some big plays and some big
pitches. That was a heck of a team
win today.”

‘ Following the back-to-back-

series wins, the Panthers feel
conﬁdent about the rest of the
regular season and their chances
of qualifying for the conference
tournament.

“Taking two straight series
was a must in an effort to make
the tournament,” Devereaux said.‘
“The opportunity-to make the

tournament has pushed this team 7

to keep playing hard. We know if
we make it, we have-a chanceto.
win.” T - =

But the road to the Big East
Tournament in Clearwater, Fla.,
won’t be easy for the ninth-place
Panthers. They head to Seton Hall,

which currently sits ﬁfth in the

_ conference standings, this upcom-

ing weekend before hosting the
second-place Louisville Cardinals
in the ﬁnal seriesofthe season.
“These next two weekends will
be huge in our effort to make the
tournament,”'Devereaux said. “We
must play well against two very
good teams.” ﬂ ' _ ~_a

Pitt’s seasonends after ~

Weekend

By R] Sepich
Sports Editor

Heading into last weekend’s
three-game series against Notre
Dame, the Pitt softball team knew
that all it needed was one win to
secure its place in the top eight of
the Big East standings and earn
a trip to the conference tourna-
ment. .

’ But that win proved elusive
as the.Fighting Irish (36-13, 16-3
Big East) swept the Panthers (26-
26, 8-14 Big East) in dominating
fashion to bring Pitt’s season to
a frustrating end. V

“After the series, Pitt senior in-
ﬁelder Ciera Damon said picking

up the necessary victory was al--

ways going to be difficult against
Notre Dame.

“It’s disappointing to go out
with such a frustrating weekend
and knowinglwe didn’t make the
Big East Tournament, but Notre
Dame is a really tough team,” she

said.

This season marked the first

time since 2009 that Pitt failed to
qualify for the Big East Tourna-
ment in softball. '

Notre Dame 5, Pitt 0

With a shutout victory from
sta-r pitcher Laura Winter in
Saturday’s series opener, Notre 3
Dame set the tone for all three’:
games by showing that runs
would be hard to come by for
the Panthers.

A two-run single in the third
inning off Pitt freshman pitcher
Savannah King, who failed to add?»
to her school-record 19-win sea-
son, gave the Irish the early lead.

The Panthers looked set to re-
spond immediately in the bottom
half of the inning after loading
the bases with three consecutive,
singles, but junior catcher Holly}
Stevens lined out to end Pitt’s

P best scoring opportunity.

Notre Dame then added to its
advantage with a run in the fourth
and two more in the seventh, and
only one more Panther reached‘?
base as Pitt dropped the ‘opening

Outﬁelder Yvette Bravo (24) was one of eight Panthers who played their ﬁnal game
for Pitt last weekend, when the team failed to qualify for the Big East Tournament.

game of a doubleheader.

Pitt head coach Holly Aprile believes
that N otre Dame’s pitching staff was among
the best the Panthers faced all season.

“It was a struggle all weekend,” Aprile
said. “Notre Dame has some great pitchers,
and we just couldn’t ﬁnd a way to produce
any runs. That’s whatit came down to.”

Notre Dame 9, Pitt 1

Saturday’s second game went even
worse for Pitt.

The Irish pounded out 15 hits against
Pitt’s other freshman pitcher Alexa Larkin
as they overwhelmed the Panthers for the
second consecutive game.

After scoring a single" run in the ﬁrst
inning, Notre Dame struck for ﬁve in the
fourth inning to effectively end Pitt’s hopes
of avoiding a nervous Sunday.

Pitt senior Kelly Hmiel ﬁnally scored-

her team’s first —— and only — run of the
weekend with a solo home run in the fourth
that cut the deficit to 6-1, but her efforts
weren’t nearly enough.

Notre Dame ended the game via the
eight-run rule thanks to a three-run sixth
inning-that ﬁnished off the 9-1 Irish win.

Notre Dame 4, Pitt 0

In its last chance to ‘earn a spot in the
Big East Tournament, Pitt’s offense again
failed to produce against Winter as the
Notre Dame ace threw her second shutout
of the weekend.

' The Irish took a 2-0 lead in the third
inning thanks to a walk and two singles,
and they doubled their lead with a two—run

home run in the fourth inning.

After recording just one hit in the ﬁrst
six innings, the Panthers’ first two batters
singled to lead off the seventh and ﬁnal
inning. But Pitt’s season—long struggle to
produce clutch hits plagued the team one
ﬁnal time, and two ﬂy outs and a strikeout
ended any hopes of a dramatic comeback.

Prior to the game, Pitt honored the
eight-girl senior class, which will leave
the program as the first group of seniors

_ to never suffer a losing season,

Damon, Hmiel, Yvette Bravo, Kristen
Cheesebrew, Niki Cognigni, Keli Gaynor,
Amanda Heitmeier, andjessica Rhodunda
all played their ﬁnal. game for Pitt in Sun-
day’s season—ending defeat.

King said that she regretted that the

. team couldn’t pick up a victory on senior

day. _ -

“I felt bad that we couldn’t/send those
girls out with awin, and it’s disappointing
-not to make the Big East Tournament,” she
said. “The seniors have been awesome all
year with Alexa [Larkin] and I, so they’ll
deﬁnitely be missed.”

Damon added that the members of the V

senior class "were disappointed with how
the season ﬁnished, but that they still left
with heads held high.

“We had a great few years here at Pitt,”
she said. “We didn’t quite meet the expec~
tations we had for ourselves this year. But
with the records we broke last year and
everything, I’m still happy with how we
leave the program.” I '

Both teams find success at Big East Outdoor Championships

By Pete Blais
Sta ff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s track teams
solidiﬁed their positions as two of the best
teams in the conference this weekend after
strong performances at the Big East Outdoor
Championships.

A combined total of 14 athletes earned All-
Big East honors, helping the Panthers’ men’s
and women’s teams ﬁnish third and sixth
in their conference divisions, respectively.

Several runners on each team posted
personal records, including senior sprinter
Cambryajones, who broke her own school
records in both the 100- and 200-meter
races. Her performance also earned her the
Big East’s Most Outstanding Track Performer
award. A

“Cambrya did a tremendous job for us,”
Pitt head coach Alonzo Webb said on Uni-
versity’s ofﬁcial website. “She had a great
day and great weekend overall.”

‘ Jones’ time of 11.28 seconds in the
100-meter dash is tied for ninth-best inthe
nation, and her 22.91—second time in the

. 200-meter dash is tied for fourth-best.

“This is my last Big East championship
and I’m extremely proud of what this team
was able to accomplish,”Jones said.

— Jones’ desire to win was mirrored by soph-
omore sprinter Micah Murray, who fell and
badly scraped his arms and legs at the end
of Pitt’s 400-meter relay victory. Instead of
succumbing to the stinging injuries, Murray
managed to compete and place in three more
events over the course of the weekend.

“[Micah] showed a lot of Panther pride,”
senior sprinter Jermaine Lowery said. “He
was prepared to go out there and do what-
ever it took.” ‘

The meet was hosted by South Florida,
with the hot Tampa Bay weather providing
some different running conditions than Pitt
runners are used to.

“It was perfect weather to run fast,” Pitt ‘

senior sprinter Antony Hobwana said.
Hobwana won the gold medal in the
100—meter dash with a time of 10.34 seconds,
but he nearly missed the ﬁnals altogether.
“The preliminaries were pretty diﬂicult,”
he said. “We really had to race for it to make
it to the ﬁnals. Even though I was out of lane
eight, I knew after I got into the ﬁnals, any-
thing could happen.” ’
Hobwana also helped Pitt place ﬁrst in the
400-meter and 1,60o—meter relays.
Another strong performance came from
Elizabeth Kline, who scored a personal—best
5,046 points and ﬁnished fourth in the hep-
tathlon.

“It went great. Six out of seven events were
my personal record and my overall score was
about 200 points higher,” Kline said.

Jermaine Lowery, who was on the win-
ning 1,60o—meter relay team, also received
a gold medal for his individual victory in the
400-meter hurdles. _

“This year it was Big East Champion or
nothing,” he said. “Ever since freshman year,
I’ve been trying to win these events.”

Some other notable finishes for the
women included a third—place ﬁnish in the
400-meter forjonnique Lawrence and a ﬁfth
place ﬁnish for the 1600—meter relay team
comprised of Lawrence, Jones, Arielle Fon-
rose and Xauddina Whittington.

“As a team, we all worked really hard,”
Kline said of the women’s performance.
“Sixth place was better than indoor and
better than last year. Every yearpand every
season we keep on improving.”

For the men, Murray’s fourth-place ﬁnish
in the 400-meter, Sam Negley’s fourth-place
in the 800-meter and the silver—medal—win—
ning 3,200-meter relay team all contributed
towards the team’s overall third—place ﬁnish.

In the ﬁeld, senior Kurt Barnhart recorded
a personal best 53.15 meters in the hammer
throw and ﬁnished seventh. He also ﬁnished
ninth in the discus with a 48.83—meter toss.

in the javelin.

For the women, three Panthers placed in
the top 10 of the javelin throw. Sophomore
Jessica Rocco, freshman Taylor Slaney and
freshman Brooke Shasteen ﬁnished ﬁfth
through seventh, respectively. Sophomore
Ashley Corum also ﬁnished sixth in the triple
jump event.

Hobwana said strong performances like
this at the conference level will only help
Pitt’s programs improve by impressing po-
tential recruits. V

“We looked really good for the recruits
because we’re running well and showing we
can be up there and in contention,” he said.
“Now we’re sure we can do it.”

Up next for some runners is the ECAC
Championships this weekend in Princeton,
N.J., and regional championships the fol
lowing week. ~’—

The third—place ﬁnish for the men’s team
matched their indoor track conference mark
and signiﬁcantly improved upon last year’s
10th—place ﬁnish. The women also improved,
jumping from ninth last season to sixth.

Webb praised both of his team’s showings
in the conference championships.

“Our student—athletes performed very
well all weekend,” he said. “It was an incred-
ible performance for us. I was really happy
with our effort.” H
