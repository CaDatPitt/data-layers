A Allegheny Conference Gives
: Endorsement To Principle
  ‘ Of University-State Relation

— The Allegheny Conference on Community Development

<

The Conference

 has backed the University request to become state-related.
“endorsed” the broad principle of a State

relationship or affiliation between the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and the University.” ‘ .

H.eJ. Heinz, II, president of the Al1egheny.C‘onference ’

and board chairman of the H. J_.
Heinz Co., stated the motion won
unanimous approval of the‘ con-
ference’s executive committee.

Heinz commented that the
phrasing of Z the statement was
purposely broad so as to leave
the door open for the University

 to work out its own arrangement
with the Commonwealth.

The Conference recommenda-
tion became public as a Pitts-
burgh Press survey of reactions
to the Ford Foundation Report
also ‘was announced.

The Conference, a group of
Pittsburgh civic leaders,oa‘cted as _

 the ﬁscalvagent for the ‘commit-
tee which authored the Ford re-
port. The report recommended a

contract between the University ‘
and the State for tax support” of ‘

undergraduate schools.
Frank R. Denton, vice chair-
man of Mellon National Bank and
V Trust C0,, said, “I’m for going
t-'1).-.ahead and carrying it out.” Den-
ton, who heads the Trustees’ Bud-
get-Audit Committee, also stated

‘Youth Fare Reduction

Two national airlines have filed proposals with the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) which would reduce fares for

young passengers.

United Airlines and Allegheny Airlines have both initi-
ated action to provide reduced fares for passengers in the
12 to 22 age bracket for Allegheny, and the 12 to 21 range

for United.

The United plan would pro-
vide 50 per cent reduction in jet
coach fares on a space available
basis. Passengers with reserva-
tions and military personnel trav-
eling on a half fare stand-by
basis would be accommodated
ﬁrst.

United proposed to issue iden-
tiﬁcation cards to youths who
have proof of their age. The card
when -presented at a United tick-
et counter would permit the hold-
er to obtain a half fare ticket.
The ticket would be valid on any
United ﬂight between two points,
prdvided there were seats avail-
able. The card, which will cost
$3, would expire on the ho/lder’s
22nd birthday. ’

United has asked that the new
youth fare be effective Jan. 27
at a number of major points on
its nationwide system and Feb.
11 be extended to the airline’s
entire system with the -exception
of Honolulu, Vancouver, and cer-
tain intra-points. The intra-state
points would include trips en-
tirely within the states of Cali-
fornia, Colorado, Illinois, Nebras-

.ka, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and

Virginia. -

Also, the youth fare would not
apply during peak traffic holiday
periods such, as the Thursday be-
fore Easter and the Wednesday

before and Sunday after Thanks- ’

giving,’ Dec. 15 through 24 and
Jan. 2 through 4.

First of its kind in the north-
eastern U.S. allowing youths to
make advance reservations, the
Allegheny Young Adult Plan will
offer traveling at one-third off
regular first class fares. It will
apply to travel at any time on
any ﬂight over Allegheny’s routes.
and will not bar travelat the
lower rates during peak, holiday
travel periods.

Veriﬁcation of age will be pro-
vided through a Young Adult
Identiﬁcation ‘ Card. Allegheny
will make applications available
as soon as the CAB acts on the
proposal. There will be a $10 an-
nual service charge for the iden-
tiﬁcation card, or $5 for cards
purchased after June 30.

If approved, the Allegheny
Young Adult fare would permit
reduced rate travel among such
large educational centers as Bos-
ton, New York, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, Washington, Balti-
more, Cleveland, and Detroit’ as
well as between these points and
31 other airports on Allegheny’s
12 state system. I

Tool for Evaluation  

Project Teach Questionnaire Committee, while admit-
ting that the questionnaire-may not be completely scientiﬁc,

maintains that it has experimented and arrived at a valid ‘

tool for evaluation.

The committee experimented with three questionnaires
in order to ﬁnd out how accurate their questions were. The

trial questionnaires contained
questions used by Cornell, Har-
vard, and the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet in their course evaluation’
atte’mpts.

Through this experimentation,
the committee found that some
forms of questions were easier to
understand. For example, ques-
tions that require the student to
circle one number from 1-5, were
found poor indicators, because
people seem to straddle the left,
right, or middle and do not vary
from it. The “yes” and “no” an-
swers promote more committ-
ment to a speciﬁc point of view.

The ﬁnal questionnaire is a
synthesis of the most important
questions put in the most valid
duestion-form. The committee in-
cluded several questions which
will help estimate whether the
student was serious and objec-
tive. Another valuable device,
the committee feels, is the ques-
tion which asks the student for
“other comments.” Here the stu-
dent will be able to discuss the
size of classes and the nature of
many of the things not brought

out in the questionnaire itself.

It has been generally accepted
by schools which have under-

per cent of the questionnaires
are considered reliable, it is a
sufficient basis for evaluation.
“As far as the University is con-

Pitt’s Power Elite ’
 Since the Ford Foundation on the University was re-
leased last week there has been much speculation on its im-
pact on the University’s future. While the report is one of
lm‘any"urging a closer state affiliation, its impact will be
stronger than any other analysis to_date in shaping the new
{state relationship.

 1 Evidence of this is the recent endorsement of the re-
lport by the Allegheny Conference on Community.Develop-
zgment. Thelgroup itself is composed of prominent Pittsburgh
-civic leaders, those _urged in the report to back the develop-
‘jinent of the University and to establish strong comiiiunity
fsupport. _ - ‘
of Their endorsement shows that they are_willing to give
,Private donations if the Ford report stipulations -are follow-
‘ed: more in state students, lower tuition, state control of
:.~.-undergraduate education, and three state appointees on the
Board of Trustees. ~ A .

j. - More important than the willingness to give private
T‘support is the close link- between the Ford committee, the
-‘Allegheny Conference, and the University’s Board of Trus-
tees. The Ford Foundation studied the University at the
Trustees request and the Allegheny Conference served as
the committee’s ﬁscal agent. In othr words, the Conference
Twas ‘the local base of operation for the committee.

   
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
     
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  

n ‘ But who are the civic leaders? There are at least ﬁve
-civic leaders who have dual membership on the Board of
Trustees and the Allegheny Conference. They are: Gwilym
Price, chairman of the Board; Leon Falk, ﬁrst, vice-chair-
;man of the Board; Frank Magee ; and Henry Hillman, all of
-whom’ are Trustees.

. Another common denominator of the Trustees and the
Conference is the name Mellon. The Mellon interests in
“Pittsburgh control several major companies: Mellon Bank,
jwestinghouse Electric, United States Steel, Aluminum Com-
pany of America, Gulf Oil Corporation, and Koppers.

7. The Trustees are primarily people who are employed
in. executive positions in one of the Mellons’ major ﬁrms.
The Conference hasas two of its more distinguished mem-
bers Arthur B. Vankirk, former Conference chairman and
governor of T. Mellon and Sons, and Dr. Edward R. Weid-
len, former president of Mellon Institute and Trustee emeri-
tus" of the Board. ‘

_ To add to the list of the power elite is Frank R. Denton,
«vice-chairman of Mellon National Bank and Trust Company
_and chairman of the Board’s Budget-Audit Committee.’

-~ And what does this long list of names mean? It means
 _ that the Ford report is being backed by the forces which
I will “make or break” the University. Although the report
A. has been said to be only “under consideration” by the Uni-

versity, the backing of the power elite assures the Ford re-
-_ port of being the guideline for the new state relationship.

. Denton’s reaction was indicative of the entire group’s
’ ﬁeeling: “I’m forgoing ahead and carrying it out,” and I
am “terriﬁcally impressed” by the report. Van Burkirk add-
eld, “I don’t see any other way out for the University.

 f ﬂvate institution, it could have solved its ﬁnancial woes last
luly. It didn’t and now it has what it wanted: a report
from an academically-trained group conﬁrming the need to
go state, not private. If the grand scheme continues, the
backing of the Ford report by the power elite will assure its
_. . implementation with few deviations.

The results of Monday's election can
only be correctly viewed in the light of the
past two Student Government, (SG) con-

tests each of which was distinctly different ,

in character and in consequence. This year's
election has been the climax of party pol-
itics, protest votes and student involvement.
Nineteen hundred and sixty-four saw
the unopposed election of John Vrana_for
SG President. There was little campaign-
ing. Just prior to the election, there had
been a school-wide referendum on amend:
ments to the SG constitution which would
have limited the_number of SG senators,
curtailed its powers and lowered the re-
quirements for SG presidents, bu_t Vrana
voiced no platform on any of the Issues.
He simply ran and slid into the presi-
dency. There were no mud‘-slinging speeches
or orderly and numerous debates of the last
two campaigns. A short announcement in‘
The Pitt News listed his candidacy and that
of his... vice-president. '"
THERE WERE no issues of _merit. 
editorial listed Vrana’s’ qualiﬁcations as his
age (he was three years older than most
seniors), his lack _of experience with SG
(“he knows very little of the way in Whitih

, the organization functions and will not be

restricted by procedures of the past of
which he knows nothing”). The only prob-
lem, the editorial continued, was that Vrana
was a member of the Able Party which
“was in business to elect candidates and
was then the party of the president of a
confused SG. _

There was no contest; Vrana was elected
by a seven to one majority over Write-ins.

Vrana’s term of office was as unevent-
ful ashis campaign. He ...made a plea for
student involvement to then Vice-Chancel-

‘ lor of Student -‘Affairs Alan Rankin, advo-

cating strengthening of the-Student Af-
fairs Committee. Members of the faculty

— and administration felt “optimis_tic about
giving the Committee ._a larger voice in J

school affairs.

THE REST OF ,Vrana’s~presidency saw '

a push for repeal of the tax‘ on textbooks,
and a ten per cent student reduction on
book store sales; demand that Athletic ID
Card proﬁts (therewas then a one dollar
fee) be returned to Student Affairs and a
recommendation that commuters receive a
public school student rates on street-cars.

The development of a two-party race
was a natural event in the ’65 contest. There
had to be something to oppose the two-year
doldrum of the Able Party. Still there seem-
ed to be no ﬁght. The Pitt Progressive Par-
ty (PPP) was endorsing only senators and

the presidential opponent of Able’s Harvey _

Lefton was Independent Eric Stern. There
was only one candidate, Jerry Hogan, in
the vice-presidential race. '

, Stern’s platform gave SG control of
non-academic areas, the student activities
fee and reevaluation of distribution pro-
gram. Lefton sought “avoidance of a bu-
reaucratic run-around” and a vague “han-
dling of the fee by students.” ‘
_ THE BOOK STORE problem reappeared
in the form of Lefton’s Co-op and Stem’s
“leave it the way it is.” The ID card charge
was no longer an issue due to the Activities
Fee. Lefton was president of Men’s Dorm
Council and Hogan a _two-year SG Senator.
'}‘he Pltt N‘eV_Vs _grud_g‘ingly endorsed Lefton
on the basis of his past record,” noting

we Stand... 

by Marsha Rehns

that Stern had been unable to stir up a

“signiﬁcant conﬂict.”

There was no contest; there were only
sparsely discussed issues: Then two days
before the campaign, the PPP endorsed
Stern in a frantic rally which chafed at the
administration’s yolk and brought Stern
701 of a meager 1,280 vote total, most of
them in protest to the rubber-stamplng 9f
the Able camp and in s11PD01‘t Of stem 5
rebel image.  majority of PPP Senators,
rode in with him.

Stern’s brief reign was as the rally had
promised. It fought for SG autonomy, but
many students found the heated party by
party debate which it engendered and the
hold-up in Activities Fee allocations was
more than they had bargained for. A large
part of the conﬂict was over the Student
Affairs Committee which Vrana had adv_o-
cated. Stern’s term was hardly more fruit-
ful than the previous one.

THE 1966 election when sting of the

Stern ﬁasco was still fresh brought up three '

candidates, who, while calling for Stern’s
“student autonomy,‘ pledged a more reﬁned
way "of getting it.

The -candidates didn't run for office;

they fought for it. The Campaign was not
a glamorous one but exposed the candidates
and their running mates to a larger number
of students and in more open debates over
the issues than ever before. The qualiﬁca-
tions were so diverse that many students
were undecided on their choice as of Sun-
day evening. Manning, like Vrana, had _no
experience in SG; Engel like Hogan was a
two-year senator. Platforms were greater
rights, but Manning's was the most speciﬁc
with more suggestions of any in this or pre-
vious elections. -

There was a contest. The issues in the
campaign and the obvious need for a large
turnout to support the Winner before the ad-
ministration brought the largest vote in‘
history. 

THERE _WERE few of the elements of
past campaigns. Manning was elected by
‘the engineers, topping Mamdani by only 56
votes in leberal arts. His votes cannot be
listed as a large protest, rathergan approval
of platforms and principles in liberals arts
and the result of “broad-based” campaign-
ings in engineering. '

The victory of the SURE senators in-

. dicates block voting, but because the issues,
not the presidential candidate were being 7

considered. That SURE senators received
more ‘votes than their presidential candi-
date in their respective schools, indicate
votes by the Engels-Lerach faction, a clear
delineation between the PPP and the more
conservative ‘ticket. _ i ’

Manmng is entering on a positive note
of widespread support for a better way of

‘Sewing students. The past two elections ‘

awakened students to the fact that Without
their, support nothing could be accom-
phshed. ». -

In the recent past, SG administrations
have been like the campaigns, dull and un-
productive or boisterous and unproductive.
The las one was comparatively calm based

 

on reasoning rather than emotion and lack .

of anything better. In this respect, it has
already been fruitful. If the enthusiasm

.lasts and the promises of “pro-student”

hold,, students and their government may

Moore’s Talking Typewriter  
Teaches Reading, Writing

" By BERNI MeLEOD

In an age of novel teaching de-
vices, a unique newcomer is the
“talking typewriter.” Developed
by Dr. Omar Khayyam Moore,
University professor of psycho-
logy, the typewriter, or Edison
Response Environment machine,
can teach a child to read, write,
and spell in a game-like way.

Resembling a large steel cabi-
net, the machine has an attached
typewriter with ‘diﬁerent color
keys, an exhibitor, or display
frame, and a speaker. If in play

the child depresses a typewriter-

key, he hears the name of the
letter softly pronounced from the
speaker. No matter which key he

presses, or how rapidly he does.
so, the same voice will name the_

different letters.

Should boredom set in, another
“game” begins. A red arrow on,
the exhibitor will point to a sin:-..
gle letter, and at that point the
child ﬁnds only that the correct,‘

corresponding key will depress.

By this and other variations in.

the use of the machine, the child
learns both academic lessons and

the ability to adapt to a new 

uation. W

Dr. Moore has experimented
with his machine in a variety of
plames from a Harlem slum to a

New Jersey hospital, and has

  Substitutes Ryczaj, Cavacini

" O
Offset Szykowny s Shooting
” By JAY ROSENSTEIN
West Virginia’s bench strength, overshadowing a tre-
mendous individual effort by Larry Szykowny, led the

at the Field House.

v Mountaineers to a 90-79 victory over the Panthers last night

Subs Bill Ryczaj and’ John Cavacini almost made the
crowd of 3,120 forget about the player they had come to

' see, sophomore Ron Williams.

Ryczaj broke open the game
early in the second half when he
gunned in all nine points in a
five minute span. “He’s our trou-
bleshooter,” said WVU coach
Waters after the game. “He can't
run too well, doesn't play much
defense, and does a lot of other
things wrong, but he has a knack
of putting the ball in the hoop
when we need it.” I

Cavacina gave Waters 14 points
from the bench and all told the
West Virginia replacement con-
tributed 27 points. “That was the
difference in the ball game,” said
coach Bob Timmons. “Our bench
gave us only nine.”

The point difference wasn’t the
only value of the Mountaineers’
bench. “We got tired early,” Tim-
mons noted. “Then we couldn’t
get back fast enough to cover up
on the fast breaks.”

Waters could rest his front unit
while Timmons was forced to
play his to the limit. Then when
Bob Lovett got into foul trouble
early in. the game, the Panther
offense lost half its muscle. Lov-
ett had averaged more than 20
points a game in his last three
starts.

Szykowny tried to pick up the
slack and almost— succeeded. His
19 points in the ﬁrst half kept
the hoopsters in the game at
halftime; 37-32. “We went to
work on Lovett,” Waters admit-
ted. “But Szykowny carried them
throughout the game. He made
shots that we had defensed per-
fectly.”

According to Timmons, Szy-

kowny looked better than Wil-'

liams. “He outscored him, 29-24,
plus he covered him on defense
for most of the game although
Williams covered Stan Falenski.”
Szykowny held Williams to seven
ﬁeld goals, of which only two
were on outside jumps shots. The
rest came on the fast break lay-
ups. I

The entire West) Virginia team
found shooting within a few feet
of the basket more to their lik-
ing. They made only ﬁve of their
18 ﬁeld goals from as far- as 10
feet. A prime believer in posi-
tion play and those short pop
shots last night was Carl Head.

He hit on six of seven from
the ﬁeld, all from the same spot
and most of them against hoop-
ster sophomore ill Bennett. “With
Lovett with four personals on
him for most of the second half,
we had no choice but to put Ben-
nett inside to try to stop those
shots,” explained Timmons.

Lovett after scoring nothing
in the ‘ﬁrst half, ﬁnished the
game with 20 points.

Ken Bollens didn’t play and
won’t play for at least two more
weeks. He tore some ligaments
in the Penn State game and has
his right knee’ in a cast.

LARRY BZYKOWNY dodges 6-8' Bob Benﬁeld, West Virginia center, before ﬁring his IFRESEMAN TONY DELISIO deposits two of his 14 points after driving around West
Virginia's Wayne Grimm (11). Cubs won‘, 85-75.

Freshmen Trip Little Mountaineers
With Even Scoring, Tough Defense

 By ROY JACOBS‘
Another balanced effort by

“the freshman basketball

squad produced the Cubs’
ﬁfth victory in seven games
last night as the frosh whip-
ped the West Virginia fresh-
men 85-75, in a Fitzgerald Field
House preliminary. Five players
scored in double ﬁgures, led by
Al DiFriscia’s 17, and 16 apiece
by Tim Fisher and Steve Steven-
son. ‘

“They shot real well consider-
ing the competition,” coach Tim
Grgurich reviewed after the
game. The actual percentage was
51.4 per cent, Fisher shooting
8-10. ‘

Actually, it was not until Tony
DeLisio (14) entered the game
midway through the ﬁrst half,
that frosh began to move. Trail-
ing 20-13 at the midway mark,
they scored 11 of the next 17
points to draw within two at 6:51

Gymnasts Start
Toughest Week

It is a busy week for the gymn-
nasts as they meet Penn State,
one of the tops teams in the
country, today. It will be the sec-
ond of three matches this week
and will be held at the Fitzger-
ald Field House beginning at 3
pm. The Panthers met Georgia
Tech away on Monday and will
face Army here on Saturday.

With 17 inches of snow on the

ground the Panther wmnastics
team went south to Georgia Tech
and managed a victory 148.7 to
110.1. Their season record is now
2-3.

and ﬁnally took the lead at 3:12.
At this point Fisher was insert-
ed and his shooting held off the
Little Mountaineers’ late rally.

The Cubs, according to Grgu-
rich, played “real good defense
in the second half,” and he point-
ed to Fisher and Del/lisio. “We
had to teach them a lot‘ about
defense, but they're working hard
and really coming. And, they’re
doing it all alone.

“They used some real goofy of-
fenses, but the boys adjusted real
well. We’re going to use an all-
out press from here on to loosen
the boys up. .They’ll learn to
press.” In the second half, the
frosh limited WVU to nine ﬁeld
goals.

Although the coach felt there
was “some bad ball handling,”
the Cubs scored almost half their

baskets on assists as Len Kalata
(4), Dave Welty, Frank Clem-
ents, Stevenson, and DeLisio di-
vided 16 evenly. ‘

‘After the game, West Virginia’s
frosh coach George Krajack dif-
fered with the general Pittsburgh

sentiments about this year's Cubs. ,

With Kent State Tonight At Trees

By GEORGE LIES

Kent State helps the swim-
ming team celebrate an an-
niversary tonight at Trees
Pool at 8:00 p. m.
Although the schedule of
events is set, this may not
be a festive occasion nor a truly
regal moment. In 'fact, it may
be more like a stag party without
alcohol. »

Tonight is the anniversary of
the Kings, Rob and Ron.

When the Levine twins swam
for coach Ben Grady, he. always

‘had a’ better than average season

record, but this year marks the

_ second anniversary of the end of

their dynasty. o‘
Now, the swimming team no
longer looks to an almighty per-
sonage as they did when Rob
and Ron sped through Trees-
Pool, breaking records left and
right. Now, they depend on them-
selves for government.
_ The swimmers had leadership

. problems since the beginning of

the season, losing the ﬁrst three
meets to overpowering foes. A
week ago, however, Bucknell
University fell into a camou-
ﬂaged hole, giving Grady his ﬁrst

I , conquest of the new -year.

The swimmers won by one
point only, but the victory served
as “a shot in the arm for the
team,” co-captain Don I-Iahnfeldt
said.

Wrestling Tearn
Lacked Desire.
In Navy Defeat

“It was quite a massacre”
were the Words of coach
Dave Johnson following last
Saturday's 35-3 loss to Navy.
The big question now is whether
the wrestlers can bounce back to
prevent another scalping, Army
style, this weekend.

With the exception of Clair
Riley most of the matmen just
didn’t wrestle up to their ca-
pacity. Johnson felt that the big
difference was the overwhelming
advantage the Middies piled up
in takedowns in the ﬁrst period.

1NsUnANcI-:

In preparation for the Kent
meet tonight, coach Grady had
the team working out as usual

.just prior to a meet. He did not

work them too hard, but they had
no easy time of it, swimming
sprint after sprint without pause.

Last year when the team’s
mark sank to 2-7, Grady blamed
lack of depth as the deﬁcient fac-
tor; this year he points out the
inexperience angle. _

“The boys are improving,”
Grady said. “We schedule a lot
of rough schools, and right now
we’re. loaded with sophomores.”

Some of the sophs Grady men-
tions are John Lane, Jack Volz,
and Joe LeViere. A11 three, along
with Gary Martin, were on the
record-setting 400 -yard medley
relay team. Since then, Lane has
taken over his -primary duties,
swimming freestyle in the 200
and the 500-yard events.

LeViere, holder of the fresh-
men record, swims in his favor-
ite, the 200-yard backstroke. Volz
swims the breastroke while Mar-
tin goes in the butterﬂy.

In the three-meter dive, Don
Hahnfeldt, considered by Grady
as “one of the top divers in the
East,” has lost ‘just once this
year, and that by only one-half a
point. He has won three times.

Facing coach Bill Hoover's Kent
team tomorrow may be a sec-

ond shot in the arm for the mer--

men. Area swimmers pace Kent’s
team; Steve Garl (Bethel Park),
Greg Lampe (Erie), and Joe
Baldridge (Carnegie ), all swim

‘for Hoover, but their times are

well below the mermen’s marks.

Larry Moore, a Product Design engineer.

After receiving his B.M.E. in February, 1964, Larry joined our College
Graduate Program and began work in brake design. Stimulating assign-
ments followed in product evaluation and disc brake development. Later,
he learned production techniques while supervising one phase of the
Mustang assembly line operations. An assignment in our Truck Sales
Promotion and Training Department added still another dimension to his
experience. The ~“big picture” of product development was brought into
focus for Larry when he became associated with Thunderbird Product
Planning. From there he moved to the Special Vehicles Section . . . into

the exciting world of high-performance cars!

Currently, Larry Moore is on leave of absence, studying to acquire 
M.B.A. degree at Michigan State. He feels—and rightly so—that we're
100 percent behind his desire to improve his educational .background..
Young men with talent, initiative and ambition can -go far with Ford \
Motor Company. Think about it-—-and talk to our representative when p l

he next visits your campus.

The college graduate’s initial exposure to the,
world of business is often less than exhilarating.
The reason? A great many companies require the
recent graduate to serve a long-term apprentice-
ship in a role that offers little or no opportunity
to’ demonstrate personal capabilities. That is not
the way at Ford Motor Company. Our College
Graduate Program brings you into contact with
many phases of business, encourages self-expression
and helps you—-and us——d‘etermine where your
greatest potential lies. An important beneﬁt of the

A Program is getting to know and work with 501118”
of the most capable people in industry. One of many young men who
believes he has gained tremendously from this exposure and experience is
