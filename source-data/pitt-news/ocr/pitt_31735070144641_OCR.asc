Study to take trays from Market Central

by Mary Hancock
Staff W/riter

Could cafeteria trays be one of
the leading causes of food waste at
Pitt?

Members of a campus group
Free the Planet plan to ﬁnd out.

For the next three weeks, the
group said they will weigh food
thrown out at Market Central with
cafeteria trays against wasted food

collected from trayless students.

“I was always upset with the
amount of food waste I saw at
Market. Central. I would walk
around and see trays with a piece
of pizza not even touched up on
the conveye_r belt headed back to
the kitchen,” said Jessica Herbe,
secretary of Free the Planet and
head of the study. “The waste
makes me mad because so many

places need food, and we get all
this food that we don’t even need
or want.”

Free the Planet will track the
waste for “tray” days Tuesday and
Wednesday and for “trayless” days
March 3 and 4, said Herbe.

“Everyone in our group is pret-
ty interested, Volunteers signed up
quickly,” said Herbe. “We will be

New service “text messages bus times

T Staﬁ’ Writer

Bus arrival times are now just a

text away.

The Port Authority is beta—testing
a new program, RouteShout, that
sends text messages with scheduled
bus arrival times to its clients. The
goal is to make the transit system
more user—ﬁ:iendly.‘

“The easier it is to know when
your bus is coming, the more likely
you may be to take transit,” said Judi
McNeil, a spokeswoman for the Port
Authority. “We are also very interest-
ed in  burgeoning companies
with  our products that may
beneﬁt other transit agencies across
the country”

' A The Port Authority is testing the
technology, which was developed by

Pittsburgh—based company deeplo—’

cal, at 22 stops in student—heavy' ar-

and receive a text message with the
next scheduled bus time

The service keeps the inforrna—

_tion from all text messages within the

company, said David Evans, the chief

technology officer for deeplocal
“Students don’t have to worry

that they’ll get an ‘American Idol’

text message from us later,” said Ev— .

ans. “We don’t store user data, which ,
might persuade potential users to go
ahead and try Rou‘teShout.”

Some Pitt students said they tried
RouteShout and thought the system
would be more effective if it gave
actual arrival times as opposed to
scheduled ones, which don’t allow for
delays from heavy traffic ‘

‘ "Unfortunately, providing already
scheduled bus times is terribly outdat-
ed,” said ]ono Spring, a Pitt graduate
student “If you go to many Europe-

hard to put a GPS device in buses”
Evans said he also thought that
RouteShout would be more beneﬁ-
cial if it provided actual arrival times.
“We are prepared to install this
system,” said Evans “It’s just a matter
of when the Port Authority is ready.”

The Port Authority will do a cost— ‘

benefit analysis while it’s beta—testing
the current system to see if it would

_ like to expand the service, saidlMc—
Neil: '

. Evans said that deeplocal would
eventually like to add a feature to the
RouteShout system that would allow
people to see what is going on near
the bus‘ stops A

“Bus stops are places people
know,” he said. “So if there are parties
going on at bars or restaurants nearby,
it’d be cool to let people know.”

with special needs and the conveyer belt if
the change goes through-, she said.
Free the Planet supports green projects,

' practices and studies at the University. In the
g past, the group has brought Ralph Nader to

visit and hosted Swap-O-Palooza, a clothing
exchange event.

The group made the trayless dining proj-
ect in Market Central one of its main focuses
this semester. 0

“The goal gives us something to strive

for, something to do and something to ac-
complish,” said Herbe. ‘

Free the Planet was inspired by a study
called “The Business and Cultural Accep-
tance Case for Trayless Dining,” which came
‘out last summer. ARAl\/[ARK Higher Edu-
cation, the group that organized the study,
observed 186,000 mealsiat 25 colleges and
universities. The study found that students
produced 25 to 30 percent less waste on
days when they didn’t use trays.

Grand Valley State University in Allen-
dale, Mich., was one of the study partici-
pants. The school reported that it was able
to reduce waste_ costs by $79,000 annually by
foregoing trays.

It reduced 56 pounds of waste per per-
son in a year._ That adds up to 14 tons of
total waste. - j 0 ‘

“Sustainability studies reduce waste while
saving the environment and money, they
tend to go hand in hand,” said Herbe.

The Commuter Assistant position is a new component to the first

year Orientation program. The position is designed to help new
and commuter students start to feel connected to the University
early in their college career. Commuter Assistants will assume
much responsibility for the commuter student components of the
Orientation program and will serve as mentors for incoming

Free the Planet presented information
from ARAMARK to the Market Central
staff to gain support for the study.

Free the Planet volunteers tabled at the
entrance of Market Central last week to talk
with students and answer questions about
the potential change.

The general student body had mixed
feelings about the study.

“I use a tray pretty much every time I
come down [to Market Central], it’s conve-

. nient and I can put everything on them,”

said freshman Andrew Frank.

But he said he might reconsider if Free I

cient.

.“If it was a large percentage at least,” he

said. -

\While some students are reluctant to
support the project, others like sophomore
Lauren McAleer are eager to give it their ap-
proval.

“I only take the food I can carry without
a tray usually,” said McAleer. “Students just

pile more food on when they have trays. I \

would definitely support a movement that
got rid of trays if it reduced 21 great amount
of waste.” ,

Herbe said the change will only occur if
students approve of it. '

“We want to know what the student I

body is thinking, but at the same time we
want them to realize what a difference this
transformation could make,” said Herbe.

Military's plan should

 include unskilled immigrants

l
i

0
1

Facing two ongoing wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq, the
 military looks to bolster its
number of soldiers by recruiting
skilled immigrants living in the
United States with temporary vi-
sas. For the first time since the

Vietnam War, the armed forces.

 allow immigrants who have
lived in the United States for at
least two years to enlist, accord-
ing to The New York Times.

As an incentive, the enlisted
immigrants will have the chance

to become U.S. citizens in as lit-

tle as six months — a signiﬁcant
reduction from the time it nor-
mally takes to apply for citizen-
ship. For foreigners who come
to work or study in the United
States with temporary visas, the
path to citizenship can last more
than a decade. . ‘
Judging by its resources and
wealth, the American military is

a superpower. But it can’t sus-

tain its supremacy without an
adequate number of troops. As
the military seeks skilled tempo-
rary immigrants — it speciﬁcally
looks for bilingual immigrants
who can speak languages such
as Arabic or Chinese and immi-
grants knowledgeable in the ﬁeld
of medicine-— it’s a step in the
right direction toward increasing
troop numbers.

Although the military would
certainly beneﬁt from recruiting
immigrants who have speciﬁc
and useful abilities, why should
it limit the criteria for applying?
Essentially, if the military wants
to augment its numbers, it should
open the door to unskilled immi-
grants as well.

Of course, the military

doesn’t offer this opportunity to

illegal immigrants. Yet there ex-
ists a signiﬁcant proportion of
unskilled immigrants capable of
carrying out some of the duties
performed by U.S. soldiers.

Critics might offer concerns
that immigrants could have alle-
giances to their native‘ countries
that would trump their patriotic
feelings toward the United States.
But those in pursuit of a quick
path to citizenship very likely
feel strongly about the'country in -
which they seek citizenship given’
that they’re willing to die for it.

The skilled immigrants will
also have to undergo stringent
background checks. The govern-
ment should, of course, hold the
unskilled immigrants to these
same standards.

The military often entices re-
cruits by emphasizing 'the skills
one will learn while‘ serving in
the military. Soldiers can pick up
on a variety of abilities —— from
leadership and teamwork to en-
gineering and computer opera-
tion skills.

. Thus, the military would serve
as a means for unskilled immi-
grants to gain practical and’ use-
ful abilities. This, in turn, would
make it easier for immigrants to
ﬁnd a good job upon leaving the
service.

Though the conﬂicts in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq have stretched
on for several years, there’s still

‘no real talk of a draft. Most U.S.

citizens would no doubt ﬁnd a
draft extremely unpopular, and
one would probably only arise as

V a-last resort. Yet if more immi-

grants join the military and aug-
ment its numbers, the likelihood
of a draft would only further di-
rninish.

It's Pronounced ‘Lee’

by Lewis Lehe
Co/ztrzfuting Editor

    

Lately, Republican pundits
have viliﬁed the most well-spent
billion dollars in the whole $800
billion stimulus: $1.1 billion for
“comparative effectiveness 're-
search.” Conservative commenta-
tor Betsy McCaughey even wrote
an article called, “Ruin Your

Health With the Obama Stimulus
Plan.” _
Comparative effectiveness

research is a type of medical re-
search. Like current medical re-
search, it uses statistics and trials
to compare several treatments
to see which treatment usually
works best against a given ail-
ment. But comparative effective-
ness research goes further be-
cause it also factors the costs’ of
treatments into comparisons. _
For example, let’s say that
there are two medicines that cure
the common cold. MedA’ cures
50 percentof cases and MedB
cures 51 percent. But MedB is 20
times as expensive as MedA.
Comparative effectiveness re-

. search would not tell-a doctor to

 
  

RGOP Wrong to reject

prescribe MedA or MedB. But it
lets us ask, “Is curing an extra 1
percent of patients worth spend-
ing an extra 1,900 percent on all
patients?” Maybe, maybe not.
This type of questioning has
two uses: First, it informs pa-

tients about how an extra dollar‘

will likely affect their situation.

‘You might ﬁnd yourself choos-

ing between spinal surgery and
muscle therapy. But without these

"statistics, you or your.doctor will

have to act on a gut instinct that’s
statistically no better than a coin

‘toss. It’s like gambling, but with

much more money at stake than
most people will toss around dur-
ing a whole week in Vegas.
‘Additionally, the system ra-
tions government health spend-
ing. “Rationing” means that the
government would only pay for
treatments deemed cost-effec-
tive. Your doctor might prescribe
a treatment, like MedB, but the
government program that pro-
,vides your health insurance 
refuse to pay for the treatment.
For the record, Medicare, Medic-
aid, Veterans Affairs and SCHIP
‘are sources of government health
insurance. 1 
It’s this rationing that has Re-

“If the federal government
spends, as this does, $1.1 billion
to begin to ﬁgure out what treat-
ments or drugs are more expen-
sive,’ it’s going to use that informa-
tion to deny you and your doctor
the right to get those treatments,”
said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
“Federal bureaucrats will mis-
use this research to ration care,
to deny life-saving treatments to
seniors and disabled people,” said
Rep. Charles Boustany ]r., R-La.

Child soldiers in Darfur sought by too manysides

 
  

by Hay Thuppal ii

Colum/ullt

A recent New York Times col-
umn shared the story of a 13-year-

old Chadian boy, Suleiman Ahsan,

who was crippled by a gunshot to
the knee and carries a machete‘ scar
across his forehead. He is a victim
of the ongoing conflict in Darfur,
but .not in the way most would
think.

Ahsan joined a militia group last
year with the hope of avenging his
father’s death at the- hands of the
janjaweed, the group that carried
out many of the atrocities in Darfur.
Still in the prime of his early days,
he exchanged childhood games for
guns and grenades. ‘

For many, Ahsan’s story is hardly’

news. It’s merely a blip in the con-

tinued tragedy unfolding in Darfur,

something to which Americans and
the rest of the world have become
regrettably immunef Upon closer
examination, though, this story rep-
resents a noteworthy shift  the di-
rection of the six-year conflict

Not only are children targeted by
the janjaweed, they are also enlisted
to ﬁght by the opposition, which
includes various rebel groups. In
2003, these groups started attacking
government institutions‘ as a means
of expressing their distaste  the
overbearing leadership. Since the ini-
tial attacks, the rebel groups became
increasingly nuanced and divided
over petty disagreements.

Wfitli declining support comes a
desperation that extends the limita-
tions of the ﬁghting. As the rebel
groups divide, their focus turns to
 numbers as they strive

‘for continued inﬂuence. This means
recruiting more child soldiers.

In December 2008, NPR inter-

viewed Jerry Farrell, an aid worker
for Save the Children who has lived
in Darfur for the past three years.
When asked about the age of the
ﬁghters, Farrell commented that
there had been a distinct drop in
their overall ages. . A
These shifts occurred in other
conﬂicts across Africa. In Uganda,
more than 20 years of 
between the government and the
I.ord’s Resistance Army endangered
the lives of millions, especially chil-
dren. As the LRA lost support for its
 against the government,
it resorted to abducting children to
maintain its ranks. It is estimated
that about 90 percent of the LRA’s
forces were abducted in their youth.
What was once a last resort has
become a prime strategy, for the
LRA ‘Children have not only been
used‘ for combat, they also work
to _recruit their peers, slipping into

schools and refugee camps during

the nights. Even though abductions
have declined because of interna-
tional action, the fact remains that
the lives of an entire generation
were, and continue to be, disrupted.

Given the parallels in Darfur, the
implications are obvious. If power-
ful nations fail to keep Darfur on
their watch,'we might see yet an-
other set of children lose their inr1o-
cence to war.

But many still wonder if stop-
ping or slowing the bloodshed in
Darfur is even possible. According
to Farrell, the United Nations mis-
sion in Darfur suffers from major

‘troop shortages that have left the
operation unable to I protect civilians
or aid workers. Any progress, Far-
rell" said, will start with peace talks
between the rebel groups in order
to ﬁnd out which ones actually want
political change in Sudan. If the
Obama administration intends to
take action, overseeing these talks

would be ad ﬁne start.

As of now, the effectiveness of
any  requires that involve-
ment from US. programs such as
“Darfur from Day One” put pres-
sure on President Obama to act on
this issue. ‘The initiative, created by
STAND, did so by helping individu-
als fax Obama about Darfur duiing
his first day in ofﬁce.

gressed, it’s become harder and

care is intact. You can still go get
10 knee surgeries if you want to,
it’s just that taxes will not pay for
them.

Taxes will also not buy you a
car, even if your doctor is sure

it will cure cancer. This ex_ample -

sounds ridiculous, but cancer doc-
tors recently lobbied successfully
for Medicare to start covering
“off-label” cancer drugs —— mean-
ing drugs that are prescribed for
conditions they are not approved
to treat, and for which there is no

clinical evidence that the drugs _

will work. Some off-label drugs
cost $10,000 per month, so in a
sense it would be better for tax-

care really did buy cars for cancer
patients. I _ ‘

' Plus, we already have ration-
ing. Medicare will not pay for
your treatment if you are not el-

derly. And Medicaid won’t pay if

you are not impoverished.

. Yet Republicans don’t advo-
cate extending Medicare or Med-
icaid to more Americans. Their
position seems to be this: Few
people should have government
insurance because it’s socialist

i for the government to buy health
care. However, should someone
have - government health insur-

' ance, it’s socialist for the govern-

ment to not buy them health care

Republicans should be-s‘mart-
er than to fret over the “R-word.”
Comparative effectiveness is
something sober conservatives
embrace: It cuts useless spending.
Plus, conservatives have always
advo’cated using stats to ﬁre lazy
teachers, slash regulations and re-
structure welfare.

If ‘Republicans ‘resist ' ration-
ing for government health care,
will they also‘ startjﬁghting‘ stud-
ies that learn how much trafﬁc on
a highway will be eased by a new
bridge? I guess Republicans are
set’ on applying their “Bridge to
Nowhere” ethos to health care.

To the Editor,

We are  to express our deep disappointment and anger regarding
the “Slice of Iife” comic featured in the Feb. 18 edition of The Pitt News It
negatively portrayed the  population and perpetuated stereotypes

As students studying Latin American studies and social work, we were

shocked to discover that a prestigous
offensive comic.

The cartoon   racist undertones:  working solely in the
blue-collar service sector,  unableto assimilate and Hispanics resid-

ing  unfavorable  conditions.

For a newspaper that openly endorsed the ﬁrst black ‘president, publishing
such an i]l—humored comic illustrates regression. Minority group oppression

should never be the basis of humor.

In order to build a more tolerable and united society, we should embrace
the presence and culture of the  community.

Cabaret celebrates na's ay

Se/zlor Staﬂ Writer

My Way: A Musical Tribute
to Frank Sinatra

Pittsburgh CLO Cabaret
Downtown

Wednesday through May 10
$19 Students through Pitt Arts

The Civic Light Opera theater
is a small, intimate space Down-
town.

Its patrons roost on love seats
clustered around small tables fac-
ing the stage. There, audiences can
have a cocktail and take in the at-
mosphere of a club not unlike the
joints Frank Sinatra favored.

“Sinatra always said that he was
a saloon singer, that he was just a
guy who stood around and enter-
tained people,” said David Grapes,
the creator of ‘a musical tribute to
Sinatra playing at the CLO this
week.

As a city of immigrants, in-
dustry and hard work character-
izes Pittsburgh’s collective value
system. But song-and-dance holds
equal merit here.

When Frank Sinatra performed

here, eight times in the course of
his career, he carried himself with
the same blue-collar pride 
scrappiness on which‘ Pittsbur-
ghers pride themselves. Pittsburgh
was Sinatra’s kind of town.
“Frank Sinatra played it close
to _the chest,” said john Fredo, the
actor who plays the part of older

Sinatra in Pittsburgh CLO Caba-

ret’s production of “My Way: A
Musical Tribute to Frank Sinatra,”
which opens =\X/ednesday.

é  Sinatra could put a
song in the American
conscience and it would
never go away.'Never. ‘

DavidG1,apeS  

As a musical revue created by

Grapes and Todd Olson, “My -v

Way?’ aims to get at the essence of
the man through his music. i
That is the persona “My Way”
wants to revive through sampling
his songs, old standards and little-

known tunes interspersed with an-
ecdotes about Sinatra’s life.’

The show has a nuclear cast of
four — two women and two men.

In structuring the show, Grapes
wanted to use music to illustrate Si-
natra’s tumultuous life, using songs
to evoke a sudden ebb and flow of
emotions.

“It was a life of violent ups and
downs,” said Grapes.

Though “My Way” searches
for the core of Sinatra, it does not
want to imitate  ' '

‘‘\We’re not trying to imperson-
ate Sinatra because nobody can be
Sinatra,” said Grapes, laughing.

Fredo explained, “I don’t want
to "be Sinatra when I’m on stage. I
want to stay me and evoke Sina-
t:ra.

And as an Italian-American, the
idea of Sinatra is already attached
with an epic quality, with glory.
And that’s what we want people to
feel.” - A

Over the course of a career
that spanned nearly half a century,
Sinatra recorded 1,400 songs. His
work is ingrained in the American
conscience —— so much so that
Starbucks created an exclusive

compilation album that looped
endlessly.

His tone and regular—guy per-
sona allowed people to connect
their lives to something bigger
than themselves.

“So when I’m singing and I
look out over the audience and
I see a couple reaching for each
other’s hands? They’re somewhere
else, 10 years ago, 20 years ago,
30 years ago reliving something

' together. That’s what I want —.— I

Fredo.

From his days as a big—band
singer and a teen idol to his life as
a movie star and a prodigious re-
cording artist, Sinatra dabbled in

several genres of music.

“He had a thirst for new ma-
terial, and because he was so big,
all the music came to him first.
He could sing anything and make
something out of it,” said Grapes.

The Chairman wasn’t just a
musical ﬁgure. He was also famous
for his public antics; For a certain
generation he epitomized cool.

ll ‘-‘As the saying goes, women
loved him and men wanted to
be him,” said Grapes. “And I am
amazed at how many of my stu-
dents at University of Northern
Colorado know his music. Under
‘favorite music’ on their Facebook
pages they write Rihanna, Britney
Spears, Coldplay, Lil’ Wayne and
then Frank Sinatra! It’s incred-
ible.”

Fredo continued, “He appealed
to all agesjbecause he wanted to
stay current. He became an icon,
and once that happened, he never
wanted to relinquish that status.”

“Sinatra could put a song in the
American conscience  it would
never go away,” said Grapes, lean-
ing forward over his armchair.
“Never.”

Although her

Pop is the anti-rock, and the

Feel That Fire

Capitol Records

The only thing
more difficult than
producing an excel-
’ ' lent album is follow-
ing with an album just
as excellent.

This is - clearly
evident in Dierks Bentley’s new record, Feel

 

sidering his last album’s quality, this new
album is a slight disappointment. Bentley
does not challenge his vocals as much as he
i did on L.ong.T7z,'1> Alone, and the new songs,
' while fun and upbeat, are not of the caliber
' for which Bentley is known.

Feel T/M2‘ Fire kicks off  high gear,
quite literally. The ﬁrst track, “Life on the
Run,” has an intro of a car engine revving

that is to follow. It features a classic rock
guitar jamming, but when Bentley’s croon-
ing voice cuts in with “She never knew my
name, / At least not the one my Daddy
gave me,” the song takes on a southern-
rock sound. '
Bentley ends the song with tremendous
vocals as he sings about “living life on the
run.” However, this is the last time we hear
him challenge his voice.
The amped up speed of the album con-
tinues  the second track, “Sideways,”
which is a classic party anthem complete
with a clapping, chanting crowd in the
background. The banjo and electric guitar
create a great country party aura that Bent-
‘ley has come to perfect. _
“Hey, now, here we go, D] don’t ya play
nothing slow,” he sings. ‘Worked all week,_
it’s time to play. / Gonna get a little bit side-
ways.” i B

This is one of the many songs on the re-
cord that make you want to get up and start
dancing, and it is one of the few songs on
the album with true potential to be a radio

hit.

Bentley’s smooth voice makes “I Wan-
na Make You Close Your Eyes” a sooth-
ing love song. The content is slightly dirty,
though.

“Just leave a trail for me to follow you
into the bedroom, / And if you need a little
bit of help from me. / Babe, there’s not a
button that I can’t reach,” he croons.

But despite the sexual content of the
song, he and co-writer Brett Beavers man-
age to make it seem classy.

The rest of the album features a few
more fast-paced and danceable songs along
with a few forgettable love songs. But there
are, however, two songs that do stand
apart. V

“Last Call” is a bluegrass song featuring
banjo great Ronnie McCoury. It’s a simple
drinking song, but it features incredible
banjo solos and Bentley’s voice sounds just
a little bit more backwoods when he sings
this slightly different genre. McCoury and -
Bentley alternate singing the verses but
they both share the line “Last call for al-
cohol still ringing in my head” as they sing I
about a rough night.

The best song on the album is “Better
Believer,” a profound tune from the very.
first line. '

.“Life is seen more clearly through your
tears,” sings Bentley.

This simple line draws you into the oth-
erwise forgettable melody by making you
think. He then goes on to sing about how
“when my life’s going like I want God be-M.
comes an afterthought.” He then thinks ‘ "
about how he takes so many things for
granted and his lucky life must be a mistake
because such_ a great life “should belong to
a better believer.” 

He speaks of how wonderfulhis life is, B F
but goes on to say “Some days I’m not sat-
isﬁed. / It happens to me every time. / I
look around instead of looking up.” The
religious profundity of this song is difficult
to overlook.

The quality of “Better Believer” is what
we have come to expect from Bentley, be-
cause his previous album was filled with
songs such as this. However, Feel Tbat Fire
lacks a surplus of these songs. While it
may be fun to dance -— or two-step — to, ,
there’s not much else involved. 3

Panthers Pink the Petersen, top Bearcats

by Lauren Kirschman
Staﬁ’ Wrder

On a day when the blue-and-
gold came away with the victory,
the game was really all about pink.

\While the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team defeated Cincinnati 68-
53 at the Petersen Events Center

L on Saturday afternoon to reach 10
‘wins in the Big East and 20 wins

overall, there was a much bigger.

istory happening outside of the
'game. The theme was Pink the
Peterson, an event that helps raise
breast cancer awareness.
The annual event, linked with
Susan G. Komen for the Cure and
UPMC Health Plan, covered the

entire arena in pink. Game pro-
grams, Pittfs uniforms and Cincin-

inat1"s warm-up T-shirts — almost
everything in the arena —were pink.
Even the scoreboard lights and
Roc the Panther’s jersey changed
colors.

The Oakland Zoo, known for
being a sea of gold, also switched
to pink for ‘the afternoon. The first
1,000 students to arrive received a
free pink shirt. The majority of the
crowd wore the color, while the
band and cheerleaders traded in
their blue-and-gold as well.

During timeouts, a new face on
the big ._screen reminded attendees
of the importance of breast cancer

awareness, including Robin Rob-
erts of “Good Morning, America,”
a breast cancer survivor who was
diagnosed in 2007. Pitt coach Ag-
nus Berenato, assistant coach Yo-
lett McPhee—McCuin and the en-
tire women’s basketball team were
among the other faces to appear.

The University donated $1 for
every ticket sold to Susan G. Ko-
men for the Cure for breast cancer
research. _

The game was especially im-
portant to _Pitt’s -Sophronia Sal-
lard, who lost her mother to breast
cancer last year. She said she over-
whelmingly supports the cause, but
has learned to separate basketball

Wrestling

 Pitt continuesto struggle

February 25, 2009

-.. ..

against ranked opponents

by Adarn Littman
Senior Staﬂ Wrtiter

The Pitt wrestling team has’ spent all
season losing to ranked opponents while
remaining ‘undefeated in conference play.
But in its last regular season match of the
season, it faced its ﬁrst ranked conference
opponent in No. 13 Edinboro.

The Panthers inability to defeat an elite
team dominated its conference success,
as they lost 31..-.8 Friday night at Edinboro
(14-4, 5-0 Eastern W/restling League).

While the ﬁnal score doesn’t show it,
many of the matches were close, includ-
ing three that needed an overtime period.
The Panthers (4-7-1, 4—1-1 EWL) lost all of
those matches.

Friday night after Sheaffer and Fendone
battled. At the start of everymatch, coaches
have the option of starting the match at the
125—pound match, or using a draw which is
randomly picked by the referee. Edinboro

_ went with the draw, thus starting the match

at 133 pounds and ending with the 1j__5-
pound ﬁght. 7 9
“[Edinboro coach] Tim Flynn never ever
does that,” said Stottlemyer. “He always
starts at 125. That’s just the way it has bfcjen
forever.”  
But before the match, Edinboro’s 125-
pound wrestler, Paul Donahoe, asked his
coach if they could go with the draw, said
Stottlemyer. Donahoe was close to not mak-
ing weight, so he did a lot of running before
the match ‘ and wanted

‘ “It was frustrau'ng,”g
said Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer.

The ﬁrst' overtime
match came in the 165-
pound class. Trailing 4-2
heading into the ﬁnal
period, Ethan Headlee
cut the lead in half with
an escape. Then he took
the lead with just seconds

prepare our guys to go to the
NCAA Championships, and

stand on that podium.

Stottlemyer

some extra time to rest
and prepare for his ﬁght,
according to Stottlemyer.
It just so happened
that the random draw put
Donahoe’s match last, al-
though he didn’t appear to
be faiigued in the slightest.
The No. 1—ranked wrestler
in the 125—pound weight
class dominated freshman

remaining in the match

with a takedown. But No. 11 Jarrod King
had already accumulated more than a min-
ute of riding time to send it into the extra
period. There King used a takedown for the
7-5 win. .

Matt W/ilps and Pat Bradshaw took the
197—pound bout into/overtime, after both
men scored one point for escapes. In over-
time, Bradshaw used a takedown to earn the
3-1 win. '

The heavyweight match was the third to
go past regulation. Pitt’s No. 12-ranked Zach
Sheaffer was called twice for stalling, result-
ing in two points for No. 13 Joey Fendone
— the second call comingwith just seconds
to go in the match and tying it at two. In the
extra period, Fendone score a takedown for
the 4-2 win.

\X/hile normally the heavyweight bout is
the last of the night, there was one more

Chris Albright. Donahoe
led 14-2 before scoring a pin fall for the win,
improving his record to 28-0 on the season.

Next up for Pitt is the EWL Champion- V

ships on March 7 at Lock Haven.
V \While the Panthers are a young team and
start as many as six freshmen on some oc-

casions, Stottlemyer doesn’t expect that to ,

overwhelm his underclassmen.

“I’m really anxious to see the freshmen.

get in the tournament, and wrestle guys
they’ve wrestled before,” he said.

After that the Panthers compete in the '

NCAA Championships March 19 to 21 in
St. Louis. Stottlemyer said he expects his
team’s tough regular season schedule to play
to their advantage.

“We’ve seen most of these [top-ranked]

guys,” he said. “That’s what we want to do, '
prepare our guys to go to the NCAA Cham- p

pionships, and stand on that podium.”

(25-2, 12-2 Big East).

While Pitt’s frontcourt piled on the
points, Fields and the rest of the _guards
maintained their passing prowess.

Sophomore guard Brad Wanamaker tal-
lied ﬁve assists, and junior Jermaine Dixon
added three to' give the Panthers 17 total
for the contest. In contrast, Pitt committed
nine turnovers, with only one coming from
the backcourt.

DePaul (8-19, 0-14 Big East) switched
to a zone defense for much of the game,
but the Panthers effectively moved the ball

0 around the ‘perimeter until ﬁnding Blair,

Young or Biggs open in the paint for a

layup or easy jump shot.

‘ “Passing, I think, is our biggest strength,”
said Jamie Dixon. “It gets underappreci-
ated as well, but I think passing leads to all
the other things. Passing leads to our high
shooting percentage, passing leads to our
offensive rebounding numbers.

“We recruit passers.- We recruit guys
that see the ﬂoor and who are unselﬁsh.
It’s a gift. You have to have a feel for it.

basketball and create better shots.

“Levance is a great passer,” said Biggs.
“We’ve got Jermaine, who’s out there hit-

from her emotions.
“As emotional as I probably was coming

. in the game, I kind of learned how to sepa-

rate the two,” said Sallard. “I think I did a re-
ally good job of not faking it, but of separat-

ing.” _ .
Sallard said she tries to remember the
words her mother told her after sitting out
a year at Pitt because of her transfer from
Kansas. She told her "mother how she was
going to play this year and her mother said,
“You better do so_m,e-thing this year. ‘You bet-
ter go out there and play.”

“Just thinking about what she said, I know
that deep down inside she was really serious,”
said Sallard.

She takes care of her emotions after the
game. Her teammates and Berenato are like
family, she said, and they helped her. to man-

While raising breast cancer awareness and
money for research, the Panthers (20—5, 10-3
Big East) earned their fourth consecutive 20-
win season. The game was deﬁnitely one that
changed throughout, as Pitt shot 26.5 per-

cent in the ﬁrst half and 48.4 percent inrlrie
second ha]f._Berenato said the Panthers w:ere
getting shots in the ﬁrst half, but the problem
was in their offense and their shooting.

“I just" think the ladies decided that they
were going to attack,” said Berenato. “We felt
we needed to get our transition game going.
We didn’t have our transition game in the ﬁrst
half. Defensively, we did a great job.”

‘The Panthers dominated Cincinnatti (13-
13, 3-10 Big East) on the boards, particularly ,_
offensively where they held a 20-3 advan-
tage. 

g.

Senior guard Shavonte Zellous had .16
points and six rebounds on the game, while 
Xenia Stewaft added 16 points of her own. 
Berenato credited Chelsea Cole for providing ‘,3
the Panthers with a second-half spark. Cole T7:
had six points and eight rebounds. ' I

The Bearcats received 17 points and sev— 1:-

en rebounds from  Stephens and 10 points 
from Kahla Roudebush while dropping their 5
ninth consecutive game. A
