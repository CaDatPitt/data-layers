Regular Edition

$50 Fine Placed
On Phi Epsilon Pi
In Code Violation

Fraternity Committee Censures
Chapter’s Attempt To Evade
Regulation In Rushing

Showing its teeth for the ﬁrst time
since 1932, the men's fraternity rush-
ing code rose Friday to crack down
on the local chapter of Phi Epsilon
Pi for a violation of the established
regulations during the recently com-
pleted rushing season. '

As a result of the action passed
unanimously by the Men’s Fraternity
Committee, in a session Friday. aft-
ernoon, the guilty chapter will pay a
ﬁne of $50 to Interfraternity Council,
be placed on probation until Febru-
ary 1, 1937, and a different member
of the house shall report periodically
to the secretary of the committee.

Action was taken by the commit-
tee after it was revealed that Max
Gordon, BA38, had met at 4:30 o’clock
Saturday morning in his own room
Lester Hamburg, BA38, a member of
the Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity. Gor-
don was then taken to the home of
a high school friend of Hamburg, and
remained there until the close of the
rushing period at 2 o'clock Sunday
morning, a direct violation of Rule
2a of the regulations, which provides
that no rushee- may be a guest of any
fraternity member or pledge over
night.

Two Fraters Testify

The committee heard the testimo-
nies of Hamburg and Hubert Teitel-
baum, C37, which proved to be sub-
stantially the same as that of Gor-
don. Cross-examination of Hamburg,
after he stated that Gordon had been
taken to the friend’s home due to an
illness of Hamburg’s mother, found
Hamburg admitting that his unfamil-
iarity with the rushing rules had led
him to believe that it would be safer
to entertain Gordon in the friend’s
home.

Members of the committee which
acted upon the violation were Dr. Vin-
cent W. Lanfear, dean of men, chair-
ma.n of the committee; Philip An-
drews, C36, vice president of Interim-
ternity Council; Theodore W‘. Biddle,
assistant dean of men; Edward Dur-
kin. C36, president of IF Council;
Robert Edgar, assistant professor of
civil engineering; Joseph Rodgers,
C36. IF "Council representative to the
committee; Morris Rosenbloom, BA36.
secretary of IF Council; N. Robert
Seidle, assistant dean of men, secre-
tary of the committee; and Dr. James
>Stinchcomb, assistant professor of
classics.

The last penalty meted out by the
Men’s Fraternity Committee was a
ﬁne of $25 for a fraternity’s unlawful
additional rushing event in 1932.

  Jobs As Undertakers, Professors
Miss Youth Appeal, Says Speaker

By Sidney Shore

College professors, undertakers, mu-
sic teachers, politicians, and clergy-
men are the most heartily disliked
professions. Such are results of a
survey of the vocational likes and am-
bitions of high school students, col-
lege freshmen, and unemployed men
and women of Allegheny County. ‘

So stated Glen U. ‘Cleeton, head of
the department of industrial education
at Carnegie Tech, before the Psychol-
ogy Forum, Monday evening-.

The desired result of this survey
was to show the need of an occupa-
tional adjustment center for adults.
A bill for this purpose was intro-
duced in the State Legislature last

session, but was defeated in com-
mittee.
The pollers found. however, that

aviation is the most highly desired oc-
cupation by unemployed men. High
school boys prefer carpentry to auc-
tioneering. Unemployed women are
against laundry and factory work,
most likely because of actual experi-
ence during these lean years. They pre-

fer creative and secretarial work.

The survey also proved that women
cannot make up their minds, as a ma-
jority of them could not speciﬁcally
tell their ambition. Serious, however,
is the fact that the majority of the
unemployed are really unskilled.
Though they have worked at their
vocations, they are not really skilled
in them.

More hopeful is the news that ten
per cent of those unemployed will get
better jobs than they formerly held.
This was proved by a survey of 1,000
men two years ago, the speaker said.
Ten per cent will go back to their
jobs, 30 per cent will do the same
work with a new employer, 25 per
cent will have to adjust themselves
to new positions. The remaining 25
per cent are unemployable.

The results of the survey have been
published by the Pittsburgh Personnel
Association under the title of “Occu-
pational Adjustment in Allegheny
County.”

Dr. G. E. Jones, professor of psy-
chclogy, was chairman of the forum.

Social Workers
Will Hear Busch

Speaker To Give Talks On ‘Social
Work And Adult Education’

Henry M. Busch of Cleveland Col-
lege will be guest of the University
Division of Social Work on Friday
and Saturday for a series of discus-
sions on, “Social VVork and Adult Ed-
ucation."

According to Dr. Manuel C. Elmer,
professor and head of the department
of sociology and the Division of Social
Work, Mr. Busch will make his ﬁrst
appearance on Friday at the Faculty
Club. At 12:30 o'clock he will address
members of the faculties affiliated
with the Division.

At 3:30 o'clock Friday, Mr. Busch
will speak before a general meeting
of delegates of the Federation of
Social Agencies. His topic will be,
“Civil Liberties and Group VVork
Agencies.” At 6:15 o’clock, at the
Cathedral Mansions, Mr. Busch will
talk to present and former students
of the Division.

On Saturday he will lead a student’
conference. in Room 1401, Cathedral,
from 9 to 11 o’clock. At 12:30 o'clock
he closes his stay with an address be-
fore the workers’ section of the Group
Work Division of the Federation of
Social Agencies. This meeting will
feature a luncheon.

 

Chairman Sings
Praises Of EA

Informal Dance

“There is,” said chairman William
Britton, ChEi36, “no connection be-
tween the Engineering Association
Annual Informal Spring Dance and
the College Association Dance.

“The EA offered the ﬁrst dollar
dance on campus—4the ﬁrst dance that
was included with a smoker in the
price of an Association dues car .”

And then the EA dance chairman
went on to say more, much more.
“The young lady to accompany me
when leading the mythical grand
march in the Schenley Ballroom. this
Friday night (the engineers abolished
the grand march) is Violet Hager, a
Brownsville miss.

“A1l preparations were ﬁnished two
weeks ago. Florian Maichrzak,
ChE37. and James Shields, IE37, my
committee, aided me in this undertak-
ing. Because of this, there will be no
last minute rushes, the details have
been cared for with engineering preci-
sion.”

The sum total of these remarks is
that the EA dance is an engineering
dance, but outsiders, college students,
for instance, are invited to attend.

Jimmy Bray’s ten-piece band, well
known on the campus, will play for the
affair.

Deah—Tippetts Speaks

Dr. Charles S_ Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration,
spoke before the Allegheny Valley
Wonien’s Club at Tarentum yesterday
afternoon. He discussed “Current Ec-
onomic Problems.”

Yes, It’s A Fish Story,
But Editor Seeks Author

People hand in some pretty bad
stuff to Russell Connolly, C36, and
editor of the Panther. Mr. Con-
nolly has become a crack shot at
the Panther’s lone wastebasket,
meanwhile making mental notes
to thank the person who went to
all the bother of writing the cast-
away piece.

But today the tables are turned
on Mr. Connolly. He has found
a piece of copy which he wants to
use in his magazine———and he can't
ﬁnd out who wrote the thing.

Oh yes, the article is about gold-
ﬁsh. If you're guilty, Editor Con-
nolly will be glad to meet you at
a midnight secret rendezvous.

YM-YWCA Plans Series
Of Thursday Lenten Talks

“Can the old religion survive in this
new world?” Raymond C. Brooks asks
in his pamphle , “Building a Christian
World." To help in answering the.
question the YVVCA and YMCA have!
planned a series of Lenten services to;
meet on Thursday at 12:30 o'clock at
Heinz House.

The services “propose in this Lent-
en period to examine the nature of
this new world into which we are mov-
ing to seek for the foundations upon
which to build securely, to recognize
the contribution Jesus made and to
discover the price we must pay if we
are to build a world wherein dwells
righteousness and peace,” as Mr.
Brooks says in his article.

‘“-Can We Talk Ourselves Into a
Better World?” is the topic of the
ﬁrst meeting. Dr. H. Boyd Edwards
of the Church of the Ascension will
speak. ,Dorothy Kerr, Ed37, and
James Orth, C37, are the student lead-
ers for this service tomorrow.

Dr. Carl August Voss, of the Smith-
ﬂeld Congregational Church, will
speak on “Christ’s Unﬁnished Task,”

on March 12, Helen Robinson, Ed37,

and William Kappan, C36, are stu-
dent leaders.

“The Art of Perfection,” will be
Rev. Herbert B. Hudnut's topic. Rev.
Hudnut, of Bellevue Presbyterian
Church, will speak at the meeting of
March 19. Janet Crosby, C38, and
Robert Moorhead, C38, will be in
charge.

Mary Louise Wheeler, C38, and Wil-
liam Millard, E38, have asked Rev.
John Ray Ewers, of East End Chris-
tian Church, to speak at the service
on March 26. He will address the
group on “Why a Cross?”

lege, will speak on “Spiritual Sis-
sies.” The leaders for this meeting,
scheduled for April 2. are Marian
Campbell, C37, and Richard Canﬁeld,
C375.

At the end of the Lenten season Dr.
Louis H. Evans, of the Third Presby-
terian Church, will speak on “Easter,
What of It?” Sara Marie Wood, Ed37,

this service.

YWCA and YMCA membership is
not necessary to attend these meet-
ings. All students are invited.

Great Wealth Concentration
Brings Depression---Laidler

Mcllen’s Melody
Trust Scheduled
For Druid Drug

Earl l\'Iellen’s Orchestra is the big
Druid Drag attraction to date, al-
though President Frank Engel’s pub-
licity committee promises “real dope”
for coming issues.

But today's release from Druid
.. adquarters, concerning the after-
noon dance at Hotel Schenley from
2:30 until 5:30 o’clock Monday after-
noon. says that the Mellen Melody
Trust, direct from a triumphant ap-
pearance at some SFA tea dance
once, will play.

No one seems to know how many
men play in the orchestra, but a
special research committee has been
appointed to look into the matter for
publicity Friday.

As announced, all women students
will be guests of Druids, national
sophomore aciivities fraternity, while
the men will be assessed 35 cents
each.

Big moment of the dance will be the
“surprise” tapping of two ﬁrst se-
mester sophomores to Druids.

Paradoxes Of System
Attacked At SFA’s
Opening Forum

(See Editorial, “The First Forum”)
By William Stark

“One of the greatest trends in the
past in this country, has been toward
concentration in American industry.”
This, in the opinion of Dr. Harry VV.
Laidler. one of America’s foremost
economists, is one of the basic causes
of our present economic situation. Dr.
Laidler spoke before an enthusiastic
audience of 75 students and facility
members Monday. at Heinz House, at
a meeting sponsored by the Student
Faculty Association Forum Commit-
tee.

“\Ve see this concentration." he
continued, “in the fact that 200 great
corporations control 50 to 55 per cent
of all the wealth of the nation. VVe see
it in the fact that three or four great
overlords rule Pittsburgh, and about
eight corporations control 80 per cent
of the antliracite coal ﬁelds in Penn-
sylvania.

“This concent.rai.ion can also be
seen,” he continued, “in that one-
tenth of one per cent of the people
had an average of $75,000 per year in
1929, while 42 per cent, of the popu-
lation was necessary to over-balance
this. And 3(i,00() people had an in-
come equivalent: to that of 11 million
people, with incomes under $1,500 per
year.

Ability Not Greatest Factor

“People no longer consider these
differences in income as indications
of superior ability or thriftiness. They
have come to appreciate that vast in-
comes do not grow by thriftiness, but
are rather due to exploitation of the
great masses of the people. The fact
that 12,600,000 people are still unem-
ployed (American Federation of Labor

ﬁgures) cannot be attributed to su-

perior ability. We must begin to look
for other causes.

“Another of the great trends in this
country,” Dr. Laidler continued, “is
the great trend towards suppression,
which we ﬁnd in the economic, social,
political, as well as educational lines.

"Tl1is country has not been visited
with such a wave of red-baiting and
suppression since 1920. We have not
seen such a wave of hysteria against
all forms of liberalism in this country
in the past 15 years.

“VVe ﬁnd the greatest suppression,”
he added, “when students and work-
ers begin to organize. We ﬁnd all
sorts of fascistic -groups springing
up to crush the worker in all ways.
This suppression is brought out in
legislative investigations, hirings and
ﬁrings in colleges and universities,
floggings, and murders. This suppres-
sion is generally fomentecl in aca-
demic halls. by reactionary boards of
trustees, who are afraid because they
do not know where their next $100,000
gift will come from. They are afraid
they will offend somebody who will
boycott the institution

Hits At Super-Patriots

“Suppression arises in industry
when capitalists try to suppress the
formation of trade unions, because
they know that this means organized
1abor’s check on their activities. All
sorts of ‘100 per cent American’
groups spring up to aid in the sup-
pression of organized labor.

“Occasionally, we find newspapers
taking up the cause of suppression of
minorities, especially in intellectual
circles. Suppression in the education-
al ﬁeld is similar to the suppression
of the Middle. Ages against new in-
ventions and discoveries. There
seems to be less light and more
feudalistic control at your University
than at any other in the entire nation,
at least, according to the report of
the American Association of Univer-
sity Professors.”

To cure our industrial and economic
ills, Dr. Laidler advocated complete
social ownership of the means of pro-
duction and distribution, democratical-
ly controlled, for use and not for
proﬁt. To cure our educational ills,
Dr. Laidler suggested a “ﬁglit. on all
fronts for complete (lemocracy, com-
plete freedom of speech, with abso-
lutely no suppression.”

The First Forum

I‘ RAIN.l<‘.'D pretty hard Monday afternoon. That may
have been the reason that only '75 students and mem-
bers of the faculty found their way up to Heinz House
to hear Dr. Harry Laidler in the initial attempt of the
Student Faculty Association’s Student Forum committee.

Vlfliile the race is not :lI‘.V£l_VS in the start, the commit-
tee is quite justiﬁed in feeling :1 little perturbed that :1ot
more interest was shown Monday in a project which the
Student Faculty Association has been certain would be a
1-easonably big success. In other words, SFA and the
‘tudent Forum committee feel that they are giving the
students what the students want.

Differing from the week‘.y Inquiry Forums of the YM-
YWCA groups in that meetings of the Student Forums
are scheduled irregularly and only‘ when an outstanding
speaker happens to be available, the latter affairs are
designed to hit the top as far as forums go. It is cer-
tainly obvious, hovrever. that unless larger crowds are
guaranteed, the Student Forum committee is going to
have trouble in attracting these outstanding speakers to
the campus.

In regard to the opening affair Monday. it might be
construed as being a little unfortunate that someone
d-idn’t take the trouble to give Dr. Laidler something of
the University’s background before he launched upon
some of the statements he is reported to have made. It
is doubtful that if Dr. Laidler had spent a little time
here he would have felt justified in saying that there is
“less light and more feudalism at this University than
at any other in the country.”

We're not condemning Dr. Laidler. but we don’t be-
lieve he .has gone into the situation here with any thor-
oughness. VVe’ll wager that there are very few who will
not agree that in regard to one or two points the mem-
hers of the audience who trudged through the rain to
Heinz House Monday afternoon were not the only ones
there who were all wet.

A Campus Viewpoint
Personality In Teaching

Colleges and universities of today are coming more
and more to realize the value to the institution of men
on the staff who possess striking or captivating person-
alities. In a. recent report, Dr. Walter Albert Jessup,
president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-

Hoya Five Invades Stadium

Tonight To

Meet Panthers

 

Carlsonmen Hope To Avenge Early Season Setback
From High Scoring Georgetown Quintet

By William K. Trosen

Just one month and a half ago

the Panther cagers played George-

town basketball team down in ll-lashington, D. C. The Hoya boys

were clicking that night and when

the score reached Pittsburgh, the

Panthers had lost their third straight game and were situated way

down in last place in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference race.
Tha.t was a month and a half ago, tonight the Panther team and

the Georgetown team play their second game, this time up at the Sta-

dium.
tions are quite different, for the Pitt
boys have moved to the top Of the
league, and from the appearance of
things. are headed for their fourth
successive title.

Georgetown comes here tonight
with spurious intentions of stopping
the Panthers’ streak of ﬁve straight
league wins. Coach Fred Mesmer’s
team has done only fairly well for
themselves this season, with a stand-
ing of four wins, four defeats in the
conference.

A few weeks ago the Georgetown-
ers surprised the basketball world by
tripping NYU’s highly touted ﬁve in
a game on the Georgetown ﬂoor. At
the time, it looked as though the Hoya
ﬁve was going to be dangerous com-
petition for the league title. Then they
ﬂopped in games with Temple, Tech,
and \Vest Virginia, and their title as-
pirations went blooey.

Mesmer"s Crew Dangerous

Mesmer’s starting ﬁve is a mixture
of last years varsity men, last year
substitutes. and new men. Don Gibeau
and Tommy Nolan are teamed at the
forwards. Gibeau is a last season
varsity man while Nolan is playing
his ﬁrst year on the Hoya team. At
center is another sophomore, Mike Pe-
trosky, who stands high in the con-
ference scoring columns.

The guards are back from last sea-
son, Ben Zola and Ed Bassin taking
the ﬂoor at these positions. Bassin
leads the Georgetown individual scor-
ers and ranks ﬁfth in the league
standings. Of the ﬁve starting men,
no fewer than four places among the
12 high-point men in the conference.

The probable starting lineup:

Swimmers Meet
Teachers’ Outﬁt

Tangle Tonight At Trees Pool;
Yearlings Face YMCA Team

After taking a couple of reverses
from F & M and Army, Coach Pat,
Corr's varsity swimmers hope to‘
break into the victory column again
this evening, when they meet Slip-
pery Rock Teachers’ College in a re-
turn engagement at Trees pool.

In the earlier meeting, the Panthers
walloped the Teachers by a large
score, and barring an upset should re-
peat this evening.

Faust and Manke are the big guns
for Slippery Rock, Faust handling the
diving duties and Manke the breast-
stroke assignment.

Corr will probably rely on the same
outﬁt that started against the Army.
Captain Lindberg in the backstroke
and freestyle; Stiranko in the back-
stroke; Locke and Lavine in the
distance events; Geyer a.nd Prince in
the sprints; McQuillan in the diving;
and Anderson in the breaststroke.

The freshman natators will line up
against Greensburg YMCA’s water
outﬁt as an added feature to the water
carnival. The meet will begin at 8:15
o‘clock.

Interfrat Cage;s_ Play
Three Games Tonight

League A of the Interfraternity
basketball competition has three
games scheduled at Trees Gymnasium
this evening.

This is the second game of a ﬁve-
game schedule for all teams. Pi Kap-
pa Alpha. tangles with Phi Delta Theta
at 7 o'clock. During the next hour, Pi
Lambda Phi squares off against Sig-
ma Alpha Mu. In the evening’s ﬁnal
event at 9 o'clock. Delta Tau Delta
runs into Phi Gamma Delta.

On Thursday evening League B
plays off its second games. Kappa
Sigma encounters Theta Chi, Sigma
Chi stacks up against Lambda Chi ,
Alpha, and Phi Kappa meets Phi Ep-
silon Pi.

Relay Quartet Set
For IC4A Meet

Pitt Track Squad Departs Friday
For Third New York Title-Go

Coach Olson’s crack relay team
moves on to New York, Saturday, for
a shot at several IC4A titles and an-
other dose of treatment under the
bright championship lights of Madi-
son Square Garden. This will be the
third trek Gotham-ward and the
fourth of the month—old indoor season
for Messrs. Conneily, Groat, McCon-
nell, and Thomas.

The 1936 quartet of quarter—milers,
one that gives promise of developing
into the fastest in Panther history,
has to date upheld its end of Pitt’s
annual claim to collegiate relay hon-
ors. Although this portion of the Ol-
son clan compiled the unusual record
of ﬁnishing second in every one of its
three starts, only the best quartets
in the country were able to ring up
victories over them.

Ten days ago, Manhattan was push-
ed to a new world’s record in the
NAAU championship relay run, with
Olson’s crew just ﬂve yards short.
Previously, this same Manhattan out-
ﬁt registered a scant three-yard vic-
tory in the Millrose Games, also staged
on the boards of the Gotham indoor
arena.

Michigan, 1935 Big Ten champs,
scored a “decision by inches,” as head-
lined in a Detroit daily, over the Pitt
entry in the Michigan Invitation re-
lays at Ann Arbor. The Panther
team lead throughout three-quarters
of the race, with Connelly dropping an
uphill battle on the ﬁnal lap to the

Michigan anchor star.

This, by a process of elimination
and progression, leads Olson’s squad
to the annual indoor championships of

the Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America, the
most important all-college event of

the indoor season.

A special freshman medley relay

has also been planned for Saturday's
meet, but Coaches Olson and Potts

tional championship event earlier in

Not A Jab, But A Home Run Sock
Cave Jack Sch richer Biggest ‘Kick’

The bases weren't loaded when the rookie strode to the plate swing-
ing three husky bats and muttering threats at the Portsmouth, Ohio,
pitcher. Nor was it the last half of the ninth inning with both teams
deadlocked and the winning run on third.

But Jack Schricker, in his ﬁrst trip to the plate for the Pittsburgh
Pirates, cocked his eye on the ball as it left the pitch-
er's ﬁnger-tips, swung smoothly with his lithe 165
pounds behind his Louisville special to send the ball
whistling over the left ﬁeld fence for a homer, chalk-
ing up the second Pirate run of the game.

Jack Schricker, youthful Pitt boxing mentor, caught
the southpaw slants of Mace Brown in that game
last June. His four-bugger proved to be the margin
of victory, with the Pittsburgh Pirates eking out :1 6-5
victory over the Middle Atlantic nine in the exhibition
game.

This, he admitted, was the biggest kick he ever got
out of his many grid, ring, and baseball wars.
Schricker, who was undoubtedly the greatest 155-
pound boxer in Pitt history, also had several thrills in
boxing, his chief delight, but none could rival that

Pre-Tourney Favorites Survive First
Round Play In Ping Pong Tourney

 

Ping pong balls popped all over
Room 817 Monday as 40 table artists
bounced through the ﬁrst round of
the University's second annual Table
Tennis '1 ourney.

With one exception, pre-tourney
favorites successfully survived their
ﬁrst round matches. The one casualty
was clay court champ. Bob Madden,
who was eliminated by Erk l\lanter-
ﬁeld, 21-18, 17-21. and 22-20.

Irv Solow, defending champion.
moved into the second round by win-
ning two matches. He vanquished
Herman Laub, 21-8 and 21-10, in a
preliminary round, and then had to
turn on the pressure to nose out his
fraternity brother, Kotler, 21-19 a.nd

24-22.
Stamping himself as one of the
most dangerous contenders for

Solow’s title, Bill Brdsius. last year‘s
runner-up, also advanced by carving
out a 21-9, 21-9 triumph over Lenny

Now that the ﬁrst round weeding-
out has left a still large but seeming-
ly talented ﬁeld in the running, the
tournament should progress rapidly.
Second round matches were almost
cleared off the scoreboard yesterday
and the quarter-ﬁnals, followed by the
semi-ﬁnals, should be taken care of in
today's play. That leaves the cham-
pionship match for either Thursday
or Friday.
