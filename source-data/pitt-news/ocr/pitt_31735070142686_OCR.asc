SGB candidates might face an easy‘ win

With board and presidential candidates set to ‘run unopposed, SGB members and adviser disceuss reasons for lackof applications

Kyle Kramer
Staﬁ“Writer_

A historical lack in competition
might mark the Nov. 19 Student
Government Board election.

With eight candidates for eight
board member positions going un-
contested, it will be the ﬁrst time in
at least 30 years that the bare mini-
mum of candidates ran for the board
member positions, SGB adviserjoyce

. Giangarlo said.

Giangarlo said she remembers
single-candidate presidential races
in the past, but not since 1992, the
year when most current freshmen
were born.

Board member» Charlie Shull
commented in an e-mail onhis status
as the lone presidentialcandidate.

“It is my belief that I am sup-
ported by my peers as a qualiﬁed
and capable candidate who is going
to draw from an eclectic group of
resources in an effortto achieve suc-
cessful representation on behalf of
the Undergraduate Students at the
University of Pittsburgh,” he said
in the e—mail.

Many theories surround this
year’s lack of participation in the
election.

Board member Nila Devanath
said usually about 14 students run
for board, but that the number of
candidates is subject to public view of
the outgoing board and president. '

“In my personal opinion, years
where the board does really well and
has alot of good projects going on, a
lot of people run. If there are prob-
lems with the board and if there’s

_ a lot of drama, then they don’t -

like when the panther statue scandal
happened,” Devanath said.
The controversy to which De-

vanath referred occurred in 2007, 9
during alumnus Shady Henien’s

presidency.
He and: that year’s SGB received

criticism for spending $60,000 on '

10 6-foot panther statues, which stu-
dent organiza- '
tions painted
for Homecom-
ing. _ .
D ev an at h
said two can-
didates ran for

21 application deadline in The Pitt
News, but Heisey and the board
members postponed the deadline
to Oct. 27.

An additional 12 people picked up
applications but had yet totum them

in as of last night, Heisey said.
“If they run, then we’ll probably
be where we should,” Giangarlo

' said.

These applicants, along with any
other non-College of General Studies

have until the late application date,
this Wednesday, to apply.
Because the original deadline has

passed, candidates forthe boardwill _

need 400 signatures and candidates
for president will need 450, Heisey

_ said. ’ '

Previously, candidates needed
halfthat many signatures.

agreed.

“SGB members at Pitt sleep, eat

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

_I am writing in response-to the
review of the Coen Brothers’ new
film “A Serious Man” in the Nov.
2 issue of The Pitt News.

I agree with much of what the
writer had to say aboutthe film,
but I found his opinion far too
black and white.

While aspects of the film

truly are “tragic,” it was actu-

ally studded with moments of
humor and several scenes where
the oft bleak,iominous parts of
the narrative lightened up.
Truly literary, “A Serious

Man” transcends the confines
of conventional genres, combin-
ing tragedy, comedy and even
moments of horror.

The movie was a glimpse into
a man’s life when everything
seemed to begoingiwrong for
him. '

Please, though, give the Coen
Brothers some credit and rec-
ognize the diversity of this film.
Their work is always genre-defy-
ing and genre-deﬁning, and their
latest is.no exception.

One Plain Slice

Self-registration to the rescue

Pitt ’s new online self-"registration. system saves time and is easy to use

 
  
 

Ben Korman
Columnist

Thackeray Hall used to be where
academic dreams went to die.
You’d wake up at 6:30 on a cold,
wet spring morning and venture
out just to wait in a line that ex-
tended out the front door‘— only
hours before you discovered that
the one class you absolutely need-
ed to take was closed, and thus you
had to rework your entire schedule
all before your 9 a.m. class. '
This might sound foreign to
current freshmen. Pitt’s adoption
of online self-registration this se-
mester virtually abolishes Thack-
eray’s relentless wrath.
The new system is simple and
intuitive: Users load courses into a
“shopping cart,” ensuring that all
desired courses are open before
proceeding to checkout. Enrolling
is comparable to buying a book
from Amazon.com.

It comes as no surprise that

students have embraced the new‘

system. ‘

University Registrar Samuel
Conte said that as of Nov. 2, nearly
10,000 Pitt students had success-
fully registered online, 7,300 of
which were on the Oakland cam-

pus — the last of Pitt’s, campuses

to implement the system.

Assistant Registrar Dave Car-
men added that difﬁculties thus
far have been minimal. Many of the
students who call in with questions
are simply seeking last—minute re-
assurance, or as Carmen calls it, “a
pat on the butt.”

The advantages of self-regis-
tration are quite clear, even over-
whelming.

Not only does it eradicate the
dreaded trip to Thackeray, but as
Conte pointed out, students can
now check for open seats and even
add or drop classes while home
during breaks. The convenience
is almost comical.

“We piloted it at the regional
campuses last year, and at 11:58
p.m. on New Year’s Eve, someone
was trying to register,” Carmen
said, admittedly amused that a

student would opt to adjust his
schedule instead of, say, popping
a bottle of champagne.

But here’s the kicker: Register-

. ing for classes and partying are

not mutually exclusive activities
anymore.

You could arrive home after
a long night out, your vision and
judgment fuzzy. You might check
your e-mail, Facebook, etc., and
begin chatting with a friend, who
asks about your classes next term
— apparently one of your future
professors is a “total d**che.” You
hastily log in to my.pitt.edu and
drop the class, neglecting to re-
place it, as it were.

Ultimately, it might have been
a good decision. Some professors
are rather moronic. However, this

“-

Registering for
classes and partying

anymore.‘

behavior is borderline reckless -—
it -is Drunk Dropping.

Of course, this is only one of
many possibilities. Students can
now potentially engage in‘ Ath-
letic Adding —— laptop poised on

. stomach while doing sit-ups — and

Gluttonous Grade Option selection
-— committing to take a class pass/
fail with a mouth full of fettuccine
alfredo. I

It’s almost too easy. My enroll-
ment appointment was Oct. 26 at
9:15 a.m. I set my alarm for 8:30,

snoozed until 9:10, registered for ‘

the spring semester and was back
in bed at 9:25. Awesome.
Suspiciously awesome, some
might argue. It’s like a sci-ﬁ thrill-
er in which robots replace all the
world’s bureaucrats. Society ﬂour-
ishes with efficiency, joy and candy.
Then, the protagonist — played

by Jude Law, of course —— falls in
love with a charming outsourced
tax collector and proceeds to stage
a violent coup against the com-
puterized superstructure to win
her heart.

Although this movie is pure fan-

tasy — Contesaid self-registration '

has not resulted in any layoffs —
one part is true: The charming tax
collector represents the men and
women of G—1 Thackeray Hall.

I spoke to Karen Geragi, Verne
Scariot and Pattie Carroll, three
of the registration specialists who
would process the old paper forms
for students during registration. __

Scariot, who usually mans G-1’s
front desk, was on vacation in Dis-
neyland a few years ago when a
young man began repeatedly
shouting “Number three!” at her.
At one point in her career, she had
indeed occupied the station labeled
“3.” The young man was a former
Pitt student, and he thanked her
for her help. Oh, the humanity.

I instantly recognized Geragi.
She had guided me through an
unexpected enrollment crisis last
spring, which nearly extended my
academic career a semester.

I suggested a potential draw-
back of self—enrollment: Students
no longer have face—to-face guid-
ance when they encounter a sched-
uling problem. She agreed.

Students no longer inundate
G-1 Thackeray on the ﬁrst days of
registration, but Conte said the
specialists can now devote more
time to helping students with en-
rollment-related snags by phone,
e-mail or walk—ins. Evidently, it’s
what they do best, and it’s what stu-
dents tend to appreciate most.

Before leaving, I asked if they
had anything to add.

Carroll asked, “Have you ap-
plied for graduation yet?”

Apparently, the deadline for the
School of Arts and Sciences’ spring
graduation is this Monday.

You can pick up the necessary
forms at Thackeray Hall. Don’t try
to apply online.

Musicians will jazz things upforstudents

Colleen Counihan
Staff Writer

jazz Seminar 8: Concert Series
Carnegie Music Hall

Nov. 7, 8 p.m.

$8 student tickets

William Pitt Union box office

Pitt’s Jazz Week will end with a
syncopated bang.

A concert tomorrow at Carnegie
Music Hall will act as a culmination
of the lectures and performances of
Pitt’s annual jazz seminar. Musicians
from an earlier jazz" era, as well as
more modern musicians, will come
togetherto appreciate a genre thathas
survived on its ability to grow from
its history.

Though the seminar’s setting in
Pittsburgh— acity known for its jazz
_roots —— was not coincidental, its spe-
ciﬁc placement in Oakland buildings
like the Carnegie Music Hallwas also
intentional. A

Nathan Davis, the director of
jazz studies at Pitt and the seminars
founder, said the events are held
across Pitt’s campus so that students
can participate in what the seminar

has to offer. .

“There’s a tendency because it’s
grown so big, people see it as a pro-
fessional or city thing, but you gotta
remember this is a school. It’s about
students,” Davis said.

In an attempt to get students in-
volved, Davis gives tickets to student
organizations and ensures that dis-
plays like thejazz Hall ofFame are set
up in heavily trafﬁcked areas, such as
the William Pitt Union.

Since the seminar’s beginning40
years ago, Davis has developed his
own performance skill. V

He said his ties to the great jazz
names that have graced Pitt’s stages
are not the only reason the seminar
has succeeded. V

“I was the catalyst, but it’s not

about me,” he said. “This program ‘

was great because all those guys, like
Dizzy [Gillespie] and Kenny Clarke,
that I brought in here, they toured
and when they were interviewed,
they’d say, ‘I was just at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh,’ and word would
spread.” A

Davis said bookingthe bignames
has become harder because every-
thingis more about money and agents
these days, but the appearance of

Benny Golson, a world-renowned
saxophonist from jazz’s budding days,
at this yeafs concert means the old
ways haven’t been lost.

“Benny and I go way back,” Davis
said ofhis friend and fellow perform-
er. “He comes because I ask him to.
He could make more money doing

cheerleader for the
seminar and concert

because it is unique.

something else.”

Golsonwillplay at Pittinthe same
year he was honored with a concert
titled “Benny Golson at 80” at the
John E Kennedy Center for the Per-

formingArts. Hehas gained recogni— .

tion after composing and performing
on movie soundtracks like “Mission
Impossible.”

Beyond his connections with Da-

vis, Golson comes to Pitt to share not
only his musical talent, but a music
that he considers to be a product of
our nation. » .

’ “It gives people an opportunity to
learn more about this music which is
our music, which is primarily jazz,
not hip—hop, not classical. This mu-

sic is inherent to our people and our ‘

country,” Golson said.
He said that unlike sports players,
he is not restricted by age limitations.

He will approach Saturday’s concert V
' with the same enthusiasm he has had

touringthe world for decades.

“I always try to give away vestiges
of myselfin the symbolic sense,” Gol-
son said. “Because that’s what I put
into the music — I put myselfinto the
music and I share that with people.
They hear my mind and my heart and
my though .”

, As part of the concert, one of the
performing musicianswillreceive the
University ofPittsburgh]azz Seminar
Committee Award andthe Pittsburgh
International Academy of Jazz will

. induct two artists (one living and one

deceased) into its Hall of Fame.
William R. Robinson, Allegheny
County Council representative and

, vice chair of CCAC’s Board of Trust-

ees, will act as master of ceremonies
for the concert, as he has done for
20 years.

With both educational and politi-
cal ties to Pittsburgh, Robinson takes
pride in the seminars.

He also contributed to the devel-
opment of Pitt’s jazz department as a
former member on the University’s
Board of Trustees.

“I consider myself a cheerleader
for __the seminar and concert because
it is unique,” Robinson said. “[The
concert] is one attempt to keep jazz
alive, not only in Pittsburgh, but in
the worl .”

Robinson said he feels justas excit-
ed to hear the classics at the concert as
he is to hear the new direction of jazz
thatthe seminar celebrates through its
incorporation of new performers.

“[The audience] is seeing the end
result of all the lessons, wisdom,
rubbing up against these jazz artists,
showing you in a practical way their
greatness,” Robinson said. .

Davis said he wouldn’t want it an
other way.

“We try to get the who’s who in

jazz,” Davis said. “But what I try to
instillineverybodyisthatthis is y’all’s

_ thing—the studen .”

Extraterrestrial activity just mildly entertaining

Brian Pope
For The Pitt News

“The Fourth Kind”
Starring: Milla Jovovich, Elias‘

Koteas
Director: Olatunde Osunsanmi
Studio: Universal Studios‘

  4'

A ﬁlm that’s as rigorously adver— «

tised as being “based on actual case
studies” as the new ﬁlm “The Fourth
Kind” raises questions about whether
one should trust a story about ex-
traterrestrial activity in an Alaskan
town.

These doubts are only intensi-
ﬁed by star MillaJovovich’s opening
disclaimer, in which she dares the

audienceto believe what they choose
to believe.

The “Resident Evil” leading lady
plays Dr. Abbey Tyler, a psychologist
who treats patients who all complain

about the same strange problem —— A

paranoia after seeing a white owl
outside their houses at night.

Tyler believes that aliens have in-
vaded the town, and the movie be-
comes an inadvertent plea to the au-
dience to jump on her bandwagon.

“The Fourth Kind” is a self-
professed dramatization of the
true events during and after 'I‘yler’s
study of the suicides that took place in
Nome, Alaska, and brainchild of writ-
er-director Olatunde Osunsanmi.

Tyler is especially sensitive to the
occurrences of the Alaskan town and
is devoted to ﬁnding an explanation.
Her husband was mysteriously and
brutally stabbed in bed next to her
while the pairwereintown conduct-
ing a study.

All on which she can depend is
her resentful son, her blind daughter
Ashley (Mia McKenna Bruce) and_her

own psychiatrist (Elias Koteas) in the
face of the heavy opposition to her
methods spearheaded by the ever-
doubting Qf_ﬁcerAugust (Will Patton).
Only with the help of a famous author-
historian can Tyler draw aconclusion
from her research: aliens.
Theﬁlmintertwines the cinematic
dramatization with authentic video
and audio documentation of the can-

g did interviews between Osunsanrni

and Tyler and the unsettling sessions
with Tyler and her Nome patients.
Still, several of the characters
have aliases to protect the identities
of those they represent.
The term “fourth kind” refers to
the most extreme and dangerous
-level of human-to-alien interaction.
In one word, it is abduction.
I found myself instantly turning
off my mind when I entered the the-

ater to watch a ﬁlm that was about 4

such a seemingly ludicrous topic. I
can’t say I am fully convinced that
'I‘yler’s story is true or if it is just a
paranoia-induced machination.
However, the ﬁlm is interesting

and the incorporation of Dr. Tyler’s

real—life work is never as dull as it

should be. ’ '
At times though, the splicing of

authentic materialwith the ﬁlmed

footagewas too gimmicky foramovie
that takes itselfso seriously. .
Jovovich certainly committed to
the role, and it’s almost possible to
ignore the fact that she bears no re-

semblance to the real Tyler.Overall,

* the performances were average and

were greatly overshadowed by the
plot. L -

For those who enjoy the science
ﬁction and thriller genres, “The
Fourth Kind” will enthrall, but ‘for
everyone else, it’s just a mildly enter-
taining Way to kill 90 minutes.

When watching Pitt’s next game,
make sure you look closely.

Pitt grabs a defensive
rebound, rebounder . turns,
outlet pass, dribble drive
and dish —' and it’s an easy
transition point in the ideal
world.

Odds are that freshman
Dante Taylor will be the first
one down the court — unless,
of course, he’s the one grabbing
the rebound. Then, he’ll be the
second one down the court.

Either way, Taylor brings a
high—octane game to the court.

Immediately_after losing last
year’s core of Dejuan Blair, Sam
Young and Levance Fields, Pitt
receives Taylor.

“He brings_a lot of energy.
He came in and got some key
rebounds and blocked some
shots,” Pitt forward Nasir
Robinson said after last week’s
75-64 win in an exhibition
game against Slippery Rock.
“He’s good at running the floor
from his position.”

Taylor had a game-high
27 points and nine rebounds
against Slippery Rock last
Saturday, which caught the eye
of Pitt coach Jamie Dixon.

“Dante shot it well,” Dixon
said. “He’s been doing a better

Taylor aims to improve on
posting up and becoming a
reliable post player, but Pitt
fans want more than that.

As the ﬁfth McDonald’s all-
American player in Pitt history
— and the first since Bobby
Martin and Brian Shorter in
1987 —- fans expect Taylor to
lead the team.

But Pitt fans should be
patient. He is, after all, only a

' freshman.

“I still have to work and out-
play guys to get into the lineup,”
Taylor said. I

As a native of Greenburgh,
N.Y., Taylor said he was raised
in a rough neighborhood.

“There was a lot of drugs, a
lot of stuff you can get involved

with that wasn’t positive,”

Taylor said. “I just started
hanging around with the wrong
people, wasn’t going to class,
stuff like that.”

He said the crowd with
which he hung out pressured
him to make bad decisions. .

“At that age, I wasn’t really
thinking about why I was doing
it,” he said. “I was looking at it

Adams makes a good first impression on Pitt fans

In his first game after transferring from Centenary College, Adarns led all players with 21 points in the Blue—Gold game

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

‘Five minutes into Pitt’s Blue—Gold

scrimmage, Chase Adams intro-
duced himself to Panther fans by
draining a 3-pointer off an assist
from Travon Woodall.

Nineteen pointslater, Pitt fol-
lowers deﬁnitely knew the new-
comer’s name. ‘

A transfer student from Cente-
nary College in Louisiana, Adams
joinsjermaine Dixon to form a se-
nior class with one combined year
of playing experience at Pitt.

_  Adams, who will begin and end
his career as a Panther this sea-

son, can play immediately because
Centenary dropped from NCAA
Division I to Division III non-schol-
arship status.

Despite being a newcomer to
the Pitt uniform, Adams, a 5—foot—
10-inch guard, brings valuable
ﬂoor experience to a Pitt team that
includes four true freshmen and
two redshirt freshmen.

He played every game in both
his sophomore and junior seasons
at Centenary, starting in 29 of 31
games each year. He started in 19
of 31 games during his freshman
season. V '

With Dixon sitting out because
of foot surgery, Adams said he

wants to take on more of a leader-

ship role for the young Panthers.

he’s our captain,” Adams said. “We
just need that kind of leadership. I
haven’t played on the Big East level,

' but I’ve been here before.”

A former point guard at Cente-
nary, Adams said he tries to per-
form the leadership duties he’s
used to, such as getting his team-
mates to their spots and making
sure they understand the coach’s
instructions__. '

“Jermaine and Brad [Wana-
maker] are deﬁnitely the head
honchos of the team,” Adams said.
“I’m more silent than vocal, but if
they need me to say something,
I will.”

Centenary head coach Greg

Gary said he wanted Adams to
become a more vocal leader while
playing with the Centenary Gentle-

‘ men, but added that Adams natu-

rally led the team because he was
the point guard.

“Sometimes, it’s diﬂicult being
a leader and having the spotlight
on you,” Adams said. “But the guys
are very receptive to what I’ve been
saying and respecting me more.
We’re making big changes and
big moves toward being a better
team.”

The transition from Centenary
to Pitt has been smooth, Adams
said, and he owes much of that to

Robinson takes advice from two NBA players

Sophomore Nasir Robinson looks to improve after backing up Deluan Blair last year, works out with Iameer Nelson

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

Standing at6 feets inches and weigh-
ing 220 pounds, sophomore Nasir
Robinson will be one of the smallest,
if notthe smallest, power forwards in
the Big East this season.

Lastyear’s starting powerforward,
'I‘yre1lBiggs, is 6feet8 inchestalland
250 pounds, and neitherwestvirginia
norV'1llanova—widely expected to be
the top two teams in the conference
this year —— have a power forward
shorter than 6 feet 7 inches.

Butthis shouldn’t be aconcem for
Panthers fans, as Robinsonhas allthe
tools necessary to beat bigger players
down low in the post.

-“I just out-smartthem. Ibeatthem
to certain spots,” Robinson said. “I
know where the ball’s goingto bounce
off the rebound, and I can beat them
with my quickness.”

While Robinson averaged only 1.2
points and 1.2 rebounds in 6.4 min-
utes ofaction per game last season, he
came on strong attimes, andhisteam
recognizedhim as its most improved
player at a postseason banquet.

   

cmmzese SCIENCE CENTER  ,.
One at the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh I ,- ’

Last season’s experience helped
him immenselybecause he could ob-
serve another undersized big man,
the 6-foot—7—inch, 260-pound center
Dejuan Blair, who weighed heavier
when playing at Pitt, from both the
bench and the ﬂoor.

“I learned a lot [from Blair], like
how he used his body and how he out-
smarted the defenders too,” Robinson
said.

Yetunlike Blair, Robinsonhasthe
ability to step away from the basket
and beat his defender with his quick-
ness and agility andwillforcehisbig-
ger and slower opponents to come out
of their comfort zones.

“I make them come out and guard
me away from the basket, and I can
beat them off the dribble,” Robinson
said.

Being more agile than the man
guarding him will also help him in
transition, which the Panthers plan
to use a lot this season as they return
several skilled guards who can help
the team capitalize on its speed to get
fast break points. V

In their 75-64 win against Slip
pery Rock in an exhibition game last

asers

Sunday, the Panthers started guards

Travon Woodall, Ashton Gibbs and
Brad Wanamaker.

“We’re going to deﬁnitely push the
ball intransition,” Robinson said. “We
do transition drills every day in prac-
tice, so we’re going to get out and do
a whole lot of running.”

Against Slippery Rock, Robin-
son had 11 points in 25 minutes and
showed off his quickness as he made
several nice cuts to the basket.

Robinson creditsjameer Nelson of
the Orlando Magic for helpinghim im-
prove in that area ofhis game. Nelson
and Robinson both went to Chester
High School in Chester, Pa.

“I worked out with him a couple
times during the summer,” Robin-
son said. “I did a lot of agility drills
with him and some skill work back
home.”

Robinson said he’ll spend time at
both forward positions. It looks like
he might play a little more at small
forward during the ﬁrst part of the
seasonwithfellowforward Gil Brown
academically ineligible.

Yet even when Brown is not in the
lineup, the team will count on Robin-
son to provide solid minutes at power

Four freshmen make up Dixon ’s best class yet

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said his most recent recruiting class of Taylor, Patterson, Richardson and Zarma is his best ever

Ben Duignan
Staff Writer

When Pitt coach Jamie Dixon
brought in Levance Fields, Sam
Young and Tyrell Biggs in 2005,
he said it was the best recruiting
class he’d ever had.

But in 2009, Dixon said Dante
Taylor, Lamar Patterson,J.J. Rich-
ardson and Talib Zanna make up
the best group of players he’s ever
brought into the program.

Fields, Young and Biggs lived
up to the hype. As this season tips
off, the recruiting class of 2009
will attempt to build on the legacy
left by some of the greatest players
in Pitt basketball history.

ranked recruit to arrive at Pitt in
more than 35 years. As a consensus
top—30 recruit and a McDonald’s
all—American, Taylor is described
as an extremely athletic post player
who can shoot. T

The freshman is also heralded
as an impressive mid—range shoot-
er and as having exceptional ball-
handling skills for someone his
size.

The National Christian Acad-
emy graduate selected Pitt instead
of Kansas, Maryland,«Florida, Con-
necticut, Villanova, Georgetown,

talent.

Dante Taylor

Indiana and Memphis.

With the departure of Dejuan
Blair and Biggs from last year’s
Elite Eight team, Taylor is expected
to compete for major minutes in
the frontcourt.

Dixon said he thinks Taylor has
the potential to develop into a star
player for the Panthers.

“Dante is going to be a great

player for us,” Dixon said. “He
works very hard. He’s not afraid
of putting in the extra work.”

Even though Taylor commit-
ted to Pitt before Blair announced
his intentions to enter_]une’s NBA
Draft, he appreciates now that
there is a huge opportunity to
make an early impression.

“When I heard that [Blair] was
leaving, I knew there would be an
opportunity for me [to play more] ,”
Taylor said. “I just want to come in
and showcase my talent.”

Taylor did just that, pacing the
team with 27 points in the Pitt’s
ﬁrst scrimmage against Slippery
Rock on Sunday.

Big East down, but will still be competitive

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ" Writer

As a conference, the Big East en-
joyed one of its strongest seasons
ever last year. It tied the record
for most teams from one confer-
ence in the NCAA Tournament
with seven.

While a lot of the league’s top
talent is now in the NBA, it should
still be competitive this season.
Here’s what fans can expect this
year in the Big East:

Cincinnati: After heading the
basketball program for three years
at Cincinnati, coach Mick Cronin
brings a great recruiting class into
2009. Watch out for McDonald’s
all—American recruit Lance Ste-
phenson.

Cincinnati boasts seven re-
turning players and two highly re-
cruited freshmen in 6-foot—4-inch
Sean Kilpatrick and 6-foot-3-inch
Jaquon Parker.

After leading the Bearcats in as-
sists and scoring for three straight

years, senior guard Deonta Vaughn
will be expected to take the leader-
ship role on the court this season.
Cincinnati ﬁnished last year’s sea-
son at 18-14 (8-10) and 10th in the

 

I’ve got the zest to hopefully
try and win another national
championship, and that’s
really our goal.

Jim Calhoun

Big East but was picked to ﬁnish
seventh in the preseason media
poll.

Connecticut: Longtime bas-
ketball powerhouse Connecticut
ﬁnished the 2008-09 season at
31-5 (15-3).

The Huskies lost to Michigan
State in their third consecutive trip
to the Final Four.

Key losses include Hasheem
Thabeet, who was drafted by the
Grizzlies, and guard A] Price, who
went to the Pacers. I

The Huskies also lost 6-foot-7
—inch playmakerjeff Adrien. With
three empty starting spots, this
team faces some serious questions.
However, Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun brought in the nation’s
sixth—ranked recruiting class.

“I’ve got the zest to hopeful-
ly try and win another national
championship, and that’s really
our goal. I’m really looking forward
to a great schedule and hopeﬁilly
a great year,” Calhoun told ESP-
News.

DePaul: The Blue Devils lacked‘

leadership last season. Coachjerry
Wainwright did not start a senior,

and the team ﬁnished 9-24 overall -

and winless in conference play.
Players Dar Tucker (18.4 ppg)
and Mac Koshwal (12.2 ppg, 9.6
rebounds), both sophomores, were
the best players for DePaul, which
was picked to repeat as the league’s
worst team in the preseason poll.

teammates. _

  Gary added.thatAdams excels
atsocializing because his outgoing
and positive personality helps him
to interact with people he doesn’t
know. ’ '

“These guys have a great chem-
istry,” Adams said. “They really
took me under their wing and
showed me how things are done.
They are like a family to me.”

Adams said he also enjoys

\ the experience of living in Pitts— A

burgh.

“I love the weather,’ even though
it’s cloudy all the time,” Adams
said. “I didn’t like the heat down
there inlthe‘ South. Also, the Pitts-

- burgh fans and the people are re-
ally nice.” "

Pitt coachjamie Dixon said the
Panthers staff heard about Adams’
situation when they were recruit-
ing another player from his high
school, Mount St. Joseph in Balti-
more. Adams’ high school coach
contacted them and explained the
circumstances, Dixon said.

Adams’ situation is interesting

 “because, although he is a senior, he

is likea freshman in many ways,
Dixon said. Though mature as a
player and as a person, Adams still
has to go through the process of
learning a new system. '
“Chase came in with a great at-

 

in their ways. But he said Adams
understands that-the instructions
the coaches offer are “little things”
and looks at the big picture.

. “I told him we are going to
coach him in certain areas and
help him understand the way we
do things and not to get frustrated

all,” Adams said. “I feel like I’m
hard-nosed and just real tough. A
lot of people like to score. I like to
stop people.” ,

Gary said Adams has good
strength and quick feet, which help
him to excel defensively.

“Very few kids have his energy

titude. He’s_i.o’pen—minded,” Dixon
said. “It’s not easy to come into a
program after you’ve been some-
where else for three years and
then also being, eligible to play
right away.” i '
Dixon said it could be difﬁcult
for older players to adjust to a new
system because they are often set

with that,” Dixon said.

Adams should ﬁt in nicely with
Pitt’s traditionally defense-minded
teams. He was the Summit League
Defensive Player .of the Year last
season after ﬁnishing ﬁrst in the

conference and eighth in the na-

tion with 2.7 steals per game.
“It’s just being tenacious over-

 

playing defense,” Gary said. “He
thrives onit.”

He ﬁnished among conference
leaders in several other categories
last season, including 11th in scor-
ing (14.6 points per game), third
in assists (4.5 assists per game)
and second in assist—to—turnover
ratio (2.24).

as having fun.”

Looking to get
him out of that
environment,
his mother, Lisa
Sharpe, pushed him
to attend National
Christian Academy in
Maryland.

It was the same
school that produced
former Georgetown
forward Patrick
Ewing Jr. and current
Oklahoma City
Thunder guard Kevin
Durant.

Taylor said that
once he left New
York, he realized how
much trouble he had
escaped at home.

“It changed me,”
he said. “My friends
saw it in me, and they
tried to keep me on

time I came home.”

Taylor said _
watching basketball V
on television made
him believe he could
be a basketball player,
especially because he
was the tallest player
in his hometown area.
He now stands at 6‘
feet 9 inches.

A certain role
model in professional
basketball grew his
interest in the sport.

Taylor said he watched the way Kobe
Bryant worked hard and never gave up
on a possession, and that inspired him.

But it was a struggle gettlngused
to life at NCA. He was away from his
mom, and academics hadga newfound
importance in his life.

‘Taylorcame to Pitt after growing up in a rough‘ neighborhood.

“Each year, I had to improve and
get my grades better,” Taylor said.‘ “Of
course, being away from my mom was
a big adjustment, but they took school

was checking up on my grades.”

Freshmen < 8

The forward said that with hard work,
he went from a “raw, chubby kid to a Mc-
Donald’s al1—American.”

Now, the freshman competes for a start-
ing job in a major Division 1 program.

passing skills and great court vision. Pat-

Taylor’s body art honors his mother

Taylor has a tattoo on his right wrist to honor his mother, as well one dedicated to his grandfather

Taylor < 12

Brown throughout the four years he

- attended NCA with Brown’s family and

two other teammates.

It was frustrating, but if Taylor didn’t
pass, he didn’t play. If he didn’t play, he
couldn’t make something of basketball.
If he couldn’t make something of

  

basketball, well — Taylor never wants
to answer that question.

Yet, it was a blessing. Not only was he
out of his rugged hometown, but he had
a mentor. Brown taught him how to take
care of his body and how to work hard
off the court.

“[Brown] was a big mentor,” Taylor
said. “Without him, I Wouldn’t be where
I am right now, getting the opportunit
to play in college.” I

_ Taylor faced stiffer competition while
playing at NCA. No longer did everyone’s
smaller size allow him to dominate.

Each year, I had to improve
and get my grades better. Of
course, being away from my
mom was a big adjustment,

"but they took school work
serious there. My coach
always was_ checking up on
my grades.

Dante Taylor -

He learned to out—work his opponent,
sprint end—to—en‘d and rebound_better
than them.

He showed off those same
characteristics against Slippery Rock.

“I bring a lot of energy to the ﬂoor
and in practice,” Taylor said.

Not bad for someone who claims
he went from a “raw, chubby kid to a
McDonald’s all—American.”

But it wasn’t all smiles when Taylor
first arrived at Pitt. t ’

“When I first got here, we did
conditioning. I came in a little out of
shape,” Taylor said, adding that Dixon
worked him hard to get into shape.

But rebounding is Taylor’s strength,
and it’s what Pitt will expect him to do.

Taylor can soar to the ball from
a standstill, snatching the ball at its
highest point with his long arms.

The tatoos on his arms, he said,
remind him of what he left behind, who
influenced him and where he must go.

His right wristlis a tribute to his
mom. '

“She means, a lot to me. I talk to her a
lot,” Taylor said.

His right forearm is a tribute to his
grandfather.

“I never got to meet him. He died
before I was born,” he said.

Then, two one—word tattoos say
“dedication” and “sacrifice.”

One ﬁnal ‘tattoo — a basketball
surrounded by a ribbon on his left
forearm — reads something Taylor
wants everyone in the Big East to
remember: “Respect my hustle.”

Adams comes to Pitt with experience, volcano

While he is a senior, Adams is eligible to play this year after his last college went from a Division I to a Division III school

Adams 4 11

said he is prepared.

“That’s why I came here,” he said. “I’ve A

been training hard in the offseason. The guys
have really pushed me to reach my potential.
I’ve got a strong competitive nature, and it
makes me just want to win at all costs.”

Gary said Adams will be able to adjust
to playing in the major conference not only
because of his competitiveness, but because
he’s a senior with plenty of playing experi-
ence.

Although the Gentlemen didn’t play in
a major conference, Gary said Adams per-
formed well against the many major pro-
grams Centenary took on during his three
years —— programs such as Texas Tech, Loui-

his dream possible. Zanna ran up mountains
in Nigeria to build speed and increase his
vertical leap and overall ﬁtness.

The freshman chose Pitt over Villanova,
Virginia, Oklahoma, Georgetown, Clemson,
Virginia Tech, Colorado, Providence, West
Virginia, Connecticut and Boston College.

Zanna helped guide Bishop McNamara
High School to a No. 3 ranking in Maryland
and averaged 14.6 points and 11.8 rebounds
during his senior season.

The forward is a consensus top-75 recruit
and was ranked as the No. 63 overall player
by Scout.com. ESPNU ranked Zanna as the
No. 10 center prospect.

Zanna will have a great opportunity to
compete for major minutes for the Pan-
thers in 2009. He didn’t play in Pitt’s ﬁrst
exhibition game because of knee and groin
injuries. ‘

siana State, Missouri and Texas.

Along with his competitive nature, Ad-
ams brings a fun-loving nature to this sea-
son’s Panthers squad.

“He’s a great kid with a great personal-
ity,” Gary said. “He’s good with kids. Any
time we had community service with kids,
he was great.”

Adams’ outgoing personality shows itself

on YouTube, which contains a mock “Cribs”
episode Adams ﬁlmed in Hawaii with his
Centenary teammates.

Things Adams claims to own in the video:
a mansion, a volcano with a spiral stair-
case inside and the Paciﬁc Ocean, which he
bought for a $250 million. -

“I was young and dumb,” he said, 1augh—
ing. “It was on-the-spot kind of thing. We

were in Hawaii. It was fun out there. I like

As Panthers fans get to know Adams this
season, they should also consider visiting
YouTube, on which Adams will introduce
them to his playful character — and his
volcano.

Georgetown: After snapping a streak
of three straight NCAA Tournament ap-

pearances last year, the Hoyas were disap-

pointed again when they lost in only the ﬁrst
round of the NIT Tournament. Coach John
Thompson III didn’t have an especially im-
pressive recruiting class, but returning Big
East Rookie of the Year Greg Monroe con-
tributed signiﬁcantly and should improve in

his sophomore season. Georgetown will turn

» to guard Chris Wright for the leadership they

need to get back on track this season.
Louisville: The 2008 Big East tourna-
ment champions received the No. 1 overall
seed in last year’s NCAA Tournament but
lost to Michigan State 64-52 in the Sweet
16. They lost two key players, junior Earl
Clark and senior Terrence Williams, to the

NBA. This‘ year, Louisville looks especially to
senior Edgar Sosa and sophomore Samardo
Samuels.

Marquette: The Golden Eagles (24—9,
12-6) ended last season with a loss to Mis-
souri in the second round of the NCAA Tour-
nament. Seniorsjerel McNeal and Dominic
James were Marquette’s standout players,
but both graduated. Head coach Buzz Wil-

7-foot-2-inch freshman Youssoupha Mbao
(Senegal) to make a big impact on the court
this year.

Notre Dame: Led by Coach Mike Brey,
the Fighting Irish (21-15, 8-10) lost to Penn
State in the semiﬁnals of the NIT tourna-
ment last year. Forward Luke Harangody
led the Big East in scoring with 23.3 points
per game and was picked as a preseason all-
American and Big East Player of the Year. “I
think we have the team and the players to
make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament
this year,” Harangody told ESPN. Senior
guards Toryjackson andjonathan Peoples
will also contribute signiﬁcantly to the Irish
this year. ’

Pittsburgh: At Pitt’s Basketball Media
Day, Coach Jamie Dixon spoke of his ex-
pectations for the Panthers this season.
“We never limit ourselves to a conference
championship or an NCAA Tournament
berth or this and that. This team can be as
good as any team that we’ve had before. No
one thinks that outside, they just look at
what we have on paper, but we don’t play
the game on paper, we play out there on
the court. Where we are now is not where
we’re going to be injanuary or February or
March.” With key losses of Dejuan Blair, Sam
Young and Levance Fields, Pitt looks to re-
turning veterans such as Brad Wanamaker,

..Ashton Gibbs andjermaine Dixon to make
an impact. Senior transfer Chase Adams
and redshirt freshman Travon Woodall are
expected to have a big impact in the back-
court. Four freshman, including McDonald’s
all-American recruit Dante Taylor, join the
squad and hope to ﬁll the gaps left by last
year’s departed players. I

Providence: The Friars (19-14, 10-8) lost
in the ﬁrst round of the NIT Tournament to
Miami last season. Head coach Keno Davis

After making a Final Four run last year, the Wildcats are led by Dante Cunningham and ranked No. 8 in the AP poll

dence, the team can look to junior guard/
forward Marshon Brooks and senior Sha-
raud Curry for leadership.

Rutgers: After ﬁnishing 11-21 in thereg—
ular season and with only two wins in the Big
East, the Scarlet Knights ended their season
with a loss to Notre Dame in the ﬁrst round
of the Big East tournament. Freshman guard
Mike Rosario was the team’s top scorer and
could make the jump to one of the confer-

,ence’s best players, and Gregory Echenique

led the nation in rebounding.

Seton Hall: The Pirates (17-15, 7-11) did
not make a postseason tournament, but
many expect that to change this year. Ju-
nior forward Jeremy Hazell ledgthe team
with 22.7 points per game. Signiﬁcant losses

.include senior guard Paul Gause, who led
the Big East in steals with an average of 2.7. .

Although Seton Hall was picked to ﬁnish
10th in the’ Big East preseason media poll,
many also think the Pirates are a sleeper
pick to compete in the conference.
St.]ohn’s: Led by Coach Norm Roberts,

.the Red Storm hopes for a better season than

last, when they ﬁnished 16-18 in the regular
season and racked up only six wins in the Big
East and fell to Richmond in the ﬁrst round
of the College Basketball Invitational. St.
John’s will return all but one player this year
and will depend on experienced players such
as juniors Paris Horne, D] Kennedy and Sean
Evans to put points on the board. V
Syracuse: Longtime coachjim Boeheim
heads a very experienced and storied bas-
ketball program in upstate New York. Last
year, Syracuse (28-10, 11-7) lost to Oklahoma
in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.
The NBA claimed three of the Orange’s stars
in Jonny Flynn, Eric Devendorf and Paul
Harris. The Orange head into their season
with the blemish of losing to a Division II

, school in an exhibition game, after Le Moyne

defeatedsyracuse 82-79 on Tuesday.

South Florida: The Bulls lost to Seton.

Hall in the ﬁrst round of the Big East tourna-
ment and ﬁnished their season 9-22 overall
(4-14). Returning starters Dominiquejones
(18.1 points per game) and Augustus Gil-
christ (10.2 ppg) were the team’s top scorers

' last year. The only loss for the Bulls was

senior starter Jesus Verdejo (12.2 ppg).
Villanova: Head coachjay Wright (300-
176 in 15 seasons) has enjoyed great success

' with the Wildcats ,' which ﬁnished last year’s

season 30-8 (13-5) and -advanced to the Final
Four for the fourth time in school history.
The Wildcats lost major players including
Dante Cunningham, Dwayne Anderson,
Shane Clark and Frank Tchuisi. Still, the

~ Wildcats were picked to win the conference

in the preseason media poll and are ranked
No. 8 in the Associated Press and No. 9 in
the USA Today preseason polls. Senior guard
Scottie Reynolds, who will forever hold a

spot in the memories of Pitt fans for his
last—second, game—winning shot against the
Panthers in the Elite Eight, returns to lead
Villanova. “All we can do is be humble and
‘hungry every time we step on that court
and put that Villanova jersey on and go out
there and play Villanova basketball for 40
minutes,” Reynolds told ESPN.

West Virginia: The Mountaineers ﬁn-

ished 28-12 (10-8) under) head coach Bob
Huggins in the 2_008—09 season. “If it’s not
the best league in the country, it’s tied for it.
We’re not going to have a drop off,” Huggins
told MountaineerTV of the condition of the
Big East this year. “If you can win our league
you can win a national championship.” West
Virginia suffered an embarrassing loss to
Dayton in the ﬁrst round of the NCAA Tour-

nament ‘and was picked to ﬁnish second in
the conference.'Sophomore forward Devin
Ebanks and senior forward Da’Sean Butler —
(17.1 ppg) return for West Virginia in the
coming season. Alex Ruoff is the only major
loss for the team. The Mountaineers are
