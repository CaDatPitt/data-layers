Sales Peak

Smashing all previous sales-
manship records, the women
of Delta Zeta fraternity aided
by battleship committee sales-
men, reached a new peak in
the defense stamp drive Wed-
nesday.

All standing records, individual
stamp sales, individual bond sales.
single day’s stamp sales, single
day’s bond sales and single day’s
totals were surpassed.

Stamp and bond sales rocketed to
$423.75, new sales record for a
single day. _

Pauline Cain, C44, led the fra-
ternity women in sale of individual
stamps, selling 58 stamps. Com-
mittee saleswoman Erma Bloch,

C44, was the top stamp seller of

the entire campaign by selling 78

stamps on Wednesday.

A record for bond sales also was
set as $243.75«worth of bonds pass-
‘ed over the counter to students and
faculty members.

Within one month, the battle-
ship committee, aided by‘women’s
fraternities, has sold stamps and
bonds to the extent of $1,123.25.

The general spirit was good, ac-
cording to salesmen, who pointed
out that students are becoming
more interested in the drive. One
student bought 74 stamps at the
booth.

The rush for stamps was so
great that after a hurried consul-
tation in the treasurer’: ofﬁce, a
member of the staff was sent to the
bank to replenish the treasurer’s
depleted supply. .

“The spirit of cooperation even

- spread beyond the school. For print-
er Guy Banks practically donated
the new posters which appeared
on campus,” said Herbert. Gall,
M43, chairman of the drive.

Next Wednesday, Theta Phi Al-
pha, women’s social fraternity, will
handle stamp sales, but they prefer
to keep their plans secret until
sales day. “New and novel" adver-
tisement was promised.

That Buell Whitehill casts his

more vividly than by “The Wom-

Wednesday evening. ' P
For here were Whitehill's thirty-
ﬁve women, lifted straight from
Bayard street to Park avenue, from
the Tuck shop to the Casino Roof,
from the Kappa house and the
Theta house and the Tri-Delt

Gothic apartments. And they sur-
vived the transition admirably.
Overly well rehearsed perhaps,
in Tuck shop repartee, the girls,
it seemed. were never better than
when they insulted one another.
Never were they more convincing
than when they threw the barbed

Engineers Open
Drive to Sign
1000 into E8<M

Offering admission to a stunt
smoker and the Engineer’s ball as
inducements, the Engineering and
Mines association today opened ‘a
membership drive with the goal
set at 1,000 students in both the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
as members.

William O'Malley,. E42, is in
charge of the drive. The smoker
has been scheduled for March 25
and is under the joint direction of
Charles Cusick, E43, and William
Saalbach, M43. Chairmen for the
Engineer’s Ball are Fred Evans,
E42, and George’ Hartenstein, E42.

- A fee of $1 entitles the student
to membership in the association,
and also to admission to the smok-
er and ball.

Last year the Engineers’ dance,
an all—University event, was at-
tended by more than 800 couples.

‘ To join the association, students

should see committee members in

any of the nine seminars.

Petitions Available »
For SFA, Men's Council

Petitions for nomination in Stu-
dent-Faculty association and Men's
council may be obtained in the
dean of men's and dean of women’s
offices. Petitions should be return-
ed by 5 o'clock next Wednesday.

Player's more recent stand—outs.
Certainly this show is the best put
on this year.
Cool, righteous to the point of
dullness, Jeanine Stephenson plays
Mary Haines with just the right

amount of ‘dignity and reserve. She’

makes an excellent foil for Marion
Boggs, a newcomer to player pro-
ductions, whose portrayal of Syl-
via Fowler was beautifully, feline.
V Miss Ioggs’ ﬁght scene with Peggy
Martin was one of the highlights in
a generally bright presentation.
Speaking of Miss Martin, it is
she who dominates the entire clos-
ing action of the play. As the rela-
tively unimportant Miriam Aarons,
Peggy completely captures the at-
tention of the audience from stars
Stephenson, Boggs, and Fike. The
titanic struggle between the Miss-
es Stephenson and Fike over
“Stephen” decreased in preponder-
ance somehow, as Peggy dashed
through her machinations‘ and com-
pletely charmed what -was an un-
usually, dull ﬁrst-night Pitt Players

We believe that free speech, free

believe that the Declaration of In-

‘ But this huge secret ballyhoo
story does nothing more than hide
the real stuff of “Citizen Kane."
(Besides the fact that the Hearst
power will probably suffocate it
over most of the nation.) “Kane”
‘is one of the few pictures that is a
new experience each time you see
it; you can again and again look
for, and find, something new in it.

_It is the ideal movie, the one you
wished someone would make, with
actors who act their parts — not
their names in lights; with a di-
rector—producer who knows what
he’s making; with a camerman that
shoots movies that move.

But‘ the important thing about
Welles’ picture is not justiits su-
perb photography, its direction, its
music‘: the important thing is the
idea, the idea of Kane that Welles
comes close to creating.

Aside from putti.ng some Thomas
Wolfe splendor on ﬁlm, Welles has
played with James Joyce’s idea of
a man’s search for youth, groping
for something he missed and con-
tinues tomiss: in Kane’s case, his
family and his home~the “Rose-
bud” the picture is built around.

It is hard to forget “Kane.” It's

harsh, and sharp, and hits you like I

~ A a blunt remark; it’: fast, always on

We believe that political free-

dom implies and acknowledges per-
sonal responsibility. VWe believe‘

that we have a great and priceless
heritage as a nation-——not only a

heritage of material resources but

of liberties, dreams, ideals, ways
of going forward.

We believe it is our‘ business, our

right and our inescapable duty to

maintain and expand that heritage.
We believe that such a heritage
cannot be maintained by the lack-
lustre, the selﬁsh, the bitterly par-
tisan or the amiably doubtful. We
believe it is something bigger than
party, bigger than our own small
ambitions’.

Welbelieve it is worth’ the sacri- ‘1 A

ﬁce of ease, the long‘ toil of years,
the expense of our heart’s' blood.

We know that our democratic
system is not perfect. We know
that it permits injustices and

~ wrongs. But with our whole hearts

we believe in its continuous power»

of self remedy. That power is not
a theory—it has been proven.

Through the years, democracy,
has given more people freedom, less
persecution and a higher standard
of living than any other system we
know. Under it, evils have been
abolished, injustices remedied, old
wounds healed, not by terror and

1’eV01uti0n; but by the slowirevolu-V
tion of consent in the minds of all‘

the people. While we maintain de-

mocracy, Wemaintain the greatest »

POWGI‘ a people can possess-——the
power of gradualheﬁicient andllaw-
ful change.

Most of all, we «believe in de-
mocracy itself-—in its -past, its

present and its future-o—in democ-.
racy as a political system do live‘
by —— in . democracy as the great ~
hope in the minds of. the free.’ We‘

believe it so deeply rooted in the
earth of this country that neither
assault from without nor dissen-
sion from within can ever wipe it
entirely from that earth.

But, because it was established
for us by the free-minded and the
daring, it is our duty now, in dan-
ger as in security, to uphold and
sustain it with all that we have and
are.

We believe that its future shall
‘and must be even greater than its
past. And to the future-——as to the
past of our forebears and the pres-
ent of our hard-won free'dor_n—we
pledge all we have to give. '

rackmen Depart for   Butler

Relay Meet; Stickel to Compete

Track coach Carl Olson takes his
indoor runners down to Indianap-
olis this morning to compete in‘
Butler Relays, one of the ﬁnest
meets of the current season. As a
team the Blue and Gold hasn’t been
too. sensational, but individually’
they have ﬂashed top notch form at
one meet or another. T

The Butler Relays will give the

Panthers a chance to display their’

Q: Individuality as the squad will not
be going after team honors.

Returning to take part in his
first meet since sustaining an in-‘
jury in the New York AC meet
will be Harold “Hap” Stickel,‘
Pitt's
“Hap” will also be able to take
his spot in the mile relay quartet‘
again, thus bringing together the

V combination of All Peretic, Bob-
Smith, and Bill Carter once more.
. Some of the best cinder outﬁts
< v in the country will be competing at
i the meet, with teams from Notrel
 Dame and most of the Big Ten
 schools being entered. Concentrat-
 ing on single honors instead of
 team points, the Panthers may be
able to make a better showing at
this meet than they have earlier
this season. ‘
Best bet for a stellar perform.
ance will be “Bullet Bill” Carter,

ly, in the race for experience,

nothing else.

‘ Rutgers is deﬁnitely the team
that,Pitt, must stop if this year’s
top honors are to be taken home
with them. Rutgers was good
enough to win by a large margin
last year and there is no reason to
believe that the squad has weaken-
ed in the interim; rather, it has
improved quite a bit.

Those who follow the sport give

Rutgers the edge because the team_

has many seasoned reserves in ad-
dition to a wealth of first line ma-
terial. They hope to keep the oppo-
sition moving at such a pace that
it will fold up of its own accord
before the battle is over.

But don't sell this season's Pan-
ther swimming team, and their
coach Ben Grady, short! Grady is
inclined to be a bit too pessimistic
at times, but to himself he must
have said time and again——“I have
a bunch of pretty good boys too."

The relay team is once again go-
ing to be the determining factor in
the outcome of this meet.‘ There
have been times during the season
when everything was even, as far
as points were concerned, until the
Gold and Blue relay team went into
action.

Carlson Continues

as a result of an experiment 'con—
{ducted among the threehundred

_members of the freshman gym
classes.

 The results, while’ ‘interesting,
“were not altogether pleasing to the

Doctor, who happens to be director
of the student health service.

“The results,” explained
Doctor, “did not indicate a quick
enough recovery and proved that
the boys were not in top physical
condition. Furthermore their rate
of application showed that they
did not acquire any new skills, nor
did they improve their condition
when they played purely for fun.”

The tests, which were given un-
der the direction of Frank Carver,
athletic publicity director and di-
rector of intramural athletics, con-
sisted of checking the pulse rate of
the students .bei'ore exercise, im-
mediately after the exercise, and

then after two, three, and four

the X

   

arch rival from Penn State. lt
isn’t known at present if Ewell will
be at the Butler meet or not, but
if he is, another duel featuring
the two speed merchants will take
place.

Dusty Rhoades and Maurice Jes-
sup will take care of the pole vault
for Pitt, while Stickel will carry
the Panther colors in the low hur-
dles. Pe_retic, Smith, Carter, and
Stickel are set to do the honors in
the mile relay.

Coach Olson also plans to take
a medley relay team to Indianap-
olis, but at this writing the make-
up of the trio isn’t known. Possible
choices for the event are Bob
Davis, Mark Allias, Bob Smith, and’
Bill Curtis.

lndiana’s Campbell Kane and,

Ohio State’s Bob" Wright are two
of the standout cindermen who will
be’ on hand at the meet to furnish
first rate competition _for the Pan-
ther runners. Kane is one of the-
ﬁnest quarter-milers in the coun-
try, while Wright is ranked with
"the best low hurdlers running to-
day.

Entries for ll-M
Spring Program
Due This‘ Week

It is a sure sign that spring is
in the air ‘when posters are hung.

on walls in the hallways of the
» Cathedral stating that the spring

intramural. program is about to be-
gin. ‘ -

Frank Carver, director of intra-
mural athletics, said today, "All
entries for intramural co'mpetition
are due in my ofﬁce this week. Re-
gardless of independent, engineer-
ing, or fraternity affiliation; we
must have deﬁniteword up here
that those particular teams will
participate.”

All sports this year will be play-
ed on a round-robin basis with the
exception of golf. This will be the
ﬁrst year for IF mushball to be
played on round-robin basis; in
the past double-elimination was
used.

With the use of the Shady-
side field and possibly the football
practice ﬁeld, in addition to the
two Trees ﬁelds, it is possible to
play enough games to complete the
season before graduation.

Last year the Phi Kappa squad
behind the strong arm of Mike So-
tack, and the steady hitting of
Frank Dax, and Bobby Tyberski,
had no trouble in copping the
Greek toga.

Baseball Candidates . . .,.
I Outﬁeld candidates for this
year's baseball team are requested
to get their eligibility cards this
week. They are to report at Gate 3
of the Stadium, Monday, March 16
at 3:30 o'clock for practice.

that ‘play for keeps.
This brought up the question, “is
it better to play ‘for fun’,’ or ‘for
keeps.’ Doctor Carlson chose the
latter. “When you play ‘for ‘Fun,’
he announced, all you get out of it
is the fun and the social contact
for the present. When you play ‘for
keeps’ you get fun plus—in the way
of increased training, increased
skills, improved conditioning, bet-
ter application, and better eﬁiu
ciency.”
This leaves no room for argu-
.ment.
