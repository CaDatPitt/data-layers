Fineman also indicated that
problem would not be resolved
the state- related appropriation
by Oct. 1.

Senate Democratic Leader
Ernest Kline, Beaver Coun-
ty, announced Monday that
the Democrats would supply
the needed votes for aHouse-
approved increase in the Cor-
porate Net Income Tax. The
votes will be guaranteed pro-
vided that the $34 million
appropriation for college schol-
arships also is passed.
Kline emphasized that the
Democratic position on the new

taxes has not changed. Yet, he
explained that he was going
along with the corporation levy
because “there is a need for the
Commonwealth to fulﬁll its com-
mitments to the students. and
the colleges in the scholarship
program.” ,

William E. Woodside, legal as-
sistant to State Senator Shoup,
explained that the appropria-
tions bills are divided into the
preferred and non-preferred cat-
egories. The appropriation con-
cerning state scholarship funds
is in the preferred categories.
According to Woodside, the Uni-
versity would probably receive

some of the 34 million dollars by
early October.

The University state- related
appropriation bill, however, is
in the non-preferred categorie.
“Most likely,” stated Woodside,
“the budget (state-related ap-
propriation) will not be passed
by Oct. 1. Thus, the University
will be forced into borrowing
ﬁve or six million dollars to
maintain its operation. Wood-
side indicated, “the budget tie-
up probably would not occur
next year.

Representative Herbert Fine-
man could not foresee any con-
ciliation on the part of the Re-

publican administration. “Sena-
tor Kline,” said Fineman, “is
having ‘off the record’ conver-
sations with the Republicans.”
However, “there is nothing con-
ciliatory on the part of the Re-
publican administration,” Fine-
man pointed out.

“The Governor is ﬁrm and in-
ﬂexible,” said Fineman. “He is
trying to blackmail the Demo-
crats into knuckling under. I
have never met anyone as stub-
born as the Governor,” contin-
ued Fineman. “If we don’t play
the game his way, he wants to
pick up the marbles and go
home.”

Matthews feels that “there is
little chance of anything 
passed right now. The whole
thing (budget tieup) is being
broken down,” said Matthews.

Matthews agreed that the Uni-
versity state-related -bill will not
be passed by Oct. 1. “As of to-
day,” stated‘ Matthews, “the
House has no bill on appropria-
tion concerning University state-
relatedness.”

‘Progress Not Through War’ Men’s Council Sets
Says Israel Representative

by ANNE DORN

"‘There was a time in his-
tory when much of progress
was made through war. This
is no longer true today.”
Thus, stated Be-nad Avital,
personal representative of the
ambassador of Israel, in a
dinner lecture given Monday
at the Webster Hall Hotel by
the World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh.

“The cost of war in human
terms is such that t-here are no
victors. There is n-o progress
from it. This is especially true
in the Middle East. For the most
part, the people have a lot of
progress to make up. An enor-
mous part of the resources have
been diverted to war.”

Avital suggested the causes
for the “six-day war” as lying
in “the Middle Eastern nations’
unwillingness to accept another
Middle Eastern country, and
their threats to destroy it.” If
the causes remain, “there will
be another War.”

He was, however, optimistic
about the possibilities. of peace.
There are no guarantees, but
the chance and the hope are
there.” He explained that until
recently, “the Arab world ' has
created a world of its own mak-
ing and refused to accept Is-
rael as a reality. They have
even produced maps on which
Israel doesn’t appear. They re-
make history.

“With -the 1967 war, Nasser
found it necessary to acknow-
ledge defeat. There is a great
awareness for the first time.”
Avital noted a “territorial dif-
ference” as well. “With Israeli
soldiers across the border, a
sense of reality creeps into the
scene.

“Another difference is in the
economic situation. The -Suez
Canal isn’t as critical as it used
to be.” Avital stated that “we
don’t know what the new aware-
ness, territorial defeat, and eco-
nomic situation will bring,” but
stressed that the “possibility for
a change toward peace is there.”

“The Arabs and the Israelis
have to relate to each other,” he
suggested. “The Arab peoples
must work out their own salva-
tion, and the world must allow
them time. The Arab nations
must accept Israel by them-
SGIVGS; no one can do it for
them.” -

ISRAELI BENAD AVITAL
Surveys Mid-East Prospects

When questioned about the
refugee problem in Israel, Avi-
tal expressed hope. “The past
solution has been the refugees’
integretion by governments in
which they found themselves.
We don’t know if the refugees
will remain under Israeli gov-
ernment, but if they do, they
won’t be refugees, but will be

integrated into society.”

Avital also responded to ques-
tions on Russian intervention in
the Middle East. “Without ex-
tensive Russian overarmament,
war would have been impossi-
ble. Nasser wouldn’t have taken
steps if not for Russia.” He add-
ed that “we have no basis for
assuming that Russia's aims will
be moderate. Her place in the
Middle East depends on con-
ﬂi-ct.”

The differences between the
position of the United States and
of Russia in the __Middle East
was another topic for discussion.
“Russia is trying to remove
American inﬂuence and substi-
tute Russian inﬂuence. Ameri-
ca is trying to maintain her in-
ﬂuence. The two naturally come
into conflict. Peace would be a
blow to Russian ambitions. If
peace is established, the rela-
tions in the future would be
commercial relations which
means Western inﬂuence.”

Avital emphasized that “peace
must come to the Middle East.
It is inconceivable that the Mid-
dle East is so far behind the
world. It can’t move forward if
its wealth is devoted to war.”

Reorganization Plans
To Encompass All Men

by DAN BOOKER A
Men’s Council (MC) President Dave Ehrenwerth has
announced plans for the restructuring of his group. The
Council has come under attack in the past year for being

in-bred and unrepresentative. The new structure proposals .

will be presented to the Student Government Committee on
Students Organizations tomorrow night.

The re-organizastion will be an amalgamation of elements of
three existing groups-—Iriterfraternity Council (IFC), Men’s Dorm
Council (MDC), and the Commuter Association (CA). The propos-
als, which Ehrenwerth said are tentative and incomplete, call for a
core of 15 members, ﬁve each from the three parent organizaltionls.
Provision is -also made for changing the name from MC to "All
Men’s Council” or “Men’s Advisory Board.”

Ehrenwerth emphasized that for MC to be effective, “-It must
be truly representative of the entire male ‘student body. Only to-
gether do they (IFC, MDC, «and CA) encompass everyone.”

Though the groups are working together, Ehrenwerth said each
will “in no way lose its power or autonomy. Rather, All Men’s Coun-
cil will serve as a forum for common needs, those common to all

men.”

The newly structured organ-izati‘o»n will continue to be respon-
sible for programming already carried out by MC. This includes
Freshman Camp, Transfer Day, the Activities Fair, and orientation’.
Student research into opinion on current University poliscies or on
existing student legislation could also -be initiated in this group.
But Ehrenwerth stressed that only recommendations on action, not
actual legislation, would evolve and be ‘sent to the three participat-

ing groups.

A second primary concern of the group would be to establish

Revised ‘Operation Match’

Commuter-Dorm ‘Sisters’ Selected

by TONI GROSSI

The City-Sister Program
of 1967 has grown from 68
participants, or 10 per cent
of last year’s‘ freshman class,
to 780 participants this fall.
The program is designed to
match a freshman dorm stu-
dent with a freshman com-
muter through a question-
naire they ﬁlled out the ﬁrst
week in September.

The questionnaire contained
eight questions relating the par-
ticipant’s academic and social in-
terests. All matching was done
by the Women’s Freshman Coun-
cil on an individual basis in or-
der to make the matches as
compatible as possible. The Coun-
cil, an elected body of 20 to 25
freshman girls, is an arm of
the Associated Women Students
(AWS).

The primary purpose of the
program, carried out on a trial
basis on last year's freshman

women, is to provide a closer
bond between the dorm students
and the commuting students.

It was felt by the Council that
the so-called gap between com-
vmuters and dorm students was-
n't due as much to apathy as to
a lack of understanding among
the various student groups. The
City-Sister Program is hoped to
give the freshman student a
stronger feeling of belonging
while attending the University.

It should give the commuter
contact in the dorms, penhaps a
resting place during the day or
a place to change clothes be-
fore a date. The dorm student,
similarly, has a chance to have
a family at school, someone who
lmows the city and home cook-
ing once in a while.

Due’ to lack of dorm space
and the higher number of com-

muters, interested -sophomores
in the dorms were given the op-
portunity through sign-up lists
and word-of-mouth to also sub-
mit applications.

After all participants were
matched, letters were sent to in-
troduce the girls to the program.
It gave them the name, address
and telephone number of their
city or dorm sister and invited
them to attend the City-Sister
Get-Together last Wednesday
with their “sister.”

The program, presented to ap-
proximately 300 girls, included
a musical comedy skirt, “Spy vs.
Spy,” presented by last year's
council; presentation of the AWS
executive officers; a short wel-
come by AWS President Ann
Bush; and the movie Tower of
Learning, concerning the Uni-
versity’s Nationality Rooms and
their conception by former Chan-
cellor Bowman. Light refresh-
ments were served afterward.

 

 

and maintain a judicial author-
ity with original jurisdiction
over cases not handled by the
IFC or MDC judicial boards. It
would also have jurisdiction
over commuters Who, because
there is no student judicial pro-
cess available, go directly to an
administrator in disciplinary
matters.

Presently, there are approxi-
mately 30 members of MC ap-
pointed at large after applica-
tion for the position by MC offi-
cers and members of the dean
of men's staﬁ. An original sug-
gestion of the Committee on
Student Organizations was that
MC have campus wide elections
in order to become a representa-
tive body. This idea was discard-
ed, but Ehrenwerth insisted that
the reorganization plans “still
give us a strong base of repre-
sentation.

The proposals for changing
MC were worked out by the
presidents and advisors of IFC,
MDA, CA, and MC. Ehrenwerth
is optimistic about the proposed
plan. “From successful program-
ming in the past and limitless
opportunities for more worth-
while projects, it is indeed obvi-
ous that there is a place for

‘MC on campus,” he said.

A  Mount Mercy Reports

 

 

   

Social Life is Not So Bad

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY ~

A- . Canan all-girls’ schools have

.a successful social life? The an-
swer seems to be an emphatic
“yes,” for the girls of .Mount
Mercy Catholic College. “One of
the best things about Mount
Mercy’s location is that we can
associate with men from the

- University, Carnegie, and Du-

quesne. Wc-’re actually better off
than if We attend any one of
these schools,” a dorm resident
said. One of her friends en-
forced her point by adding,
“We're fresh and unique to these
men since We don’t see them
every day in classes.”

The question of mixers at the
University brought a wide re-
sponse of answers. “The ﬁrst
one is great, and then they tend
to dwindle,” represents a gen-
eral comment. “They’re on about
the same par as ours,” a sopho-
more added, “although Pitt us-
ually has good bands.” “The
Tower parties are better, I
think,” a thou.ghtful junior told
me. ‘‘There’s a more congenial
atmosphere, and you can meet
all kinds of guys, not just fra-
ternity members.” The mention
of fraternities struck a respon-
sive chord in her roommate. Her
protest began with “but the fra-
lterni.-ti-es give you a ‘much broad-
er outlook on life . . .”

It might b-e inter-esting to study
the psychological effect on Uni-
versity men if they know the
general opinion of themselves at
Mount Mercy. The girls were
quite eager and candid in their

replies: “I like them,” evolved to

“I’ll date them,” while attitudes
were rated from “friendly” to
“»a.ggres-sive” to “uncouth.”
Since a portion of freshmen
women from both the Universi-
ty and Duquesne are dorming at
Mount Mercys Francis Warde
Hall the interaction of the differ-
ent campuses poses many chal-
lenges. “I think it’s an advan-

tage to have -students from other
campuses living here. We get
more realistic perspectives on
so many aspects of life, includ-
ing different religious faiths,” a.
sophomore stated. “It also helps
to promote a better social life
and gives us a taste of a more
intercollegiate atmosphere.“One
happy junior conﬁded, “What’s
really great is that collegiate
weekends for the different cam-
puses are scheduled on separ-
ate dates, making it possible for
us to go to all of them if we
can.”

One of the rooms of Francis
Warde Hall contains a rather
unique symbol of University in-
ﬂuence. A huge gold panther
statue originally from Zeta Beta
Tau fraternity is proudly on ex-
hibition. The owners intend to
bequeath the panther to future
classes.

Acting as one big family, the
Mount Mercy girls are ready to
help each other by offering ex-
periences and consolat-ions. They
try to extend that “sister unity”
to each of the students board-
ing at the Mount Mercy dorms.
As one senior puts it, “We do
our best, but I don’t know how
welcome they really feel.” Judg-
ing from the congenial warmth
of the girls ‘as they spoke, new-
comers must feel welcom-e in-
deed.

The University students board-
ing at Mount Mercy are subject
to both sets of miles. At Mount
Mercy, for instance, there are
no quiet hours and no maid
service,’ although the girls have
unlimited late permission.

An interesting conception of
University students in general
is that they are thought to be
mobile, and not a collective body,
due to the large percentage of
commuters resulting in a wide
variety of human types and in-
terest groups.

MOUNT MERCY girls pose with their prize panther.

life, classes inevitably are con-
sidered. Since the classes at
Mount Mercy are devoid of mas-
culine inﬂucnce except for an
occasional male faculty mem-
ber, the girls are in a different
type of learning environment
than that of University women.
Contrary to expectations, most
of‘ the girls prefer it this Way.
“We have good discussions, even
if we usually get only a one-
sided point of view,” one of
them remarked, “and small
classes mean more individual at-
tention.” Grades at Mount Mer-
cy rely heavily on participation
in discussions.

“Having entirely female class-
es makes it possible for us to be
ourselves,” says a senior. “Girls
accept you for yourself, and
make it easier to talk freely. If
boys are present, the girls have
to worry about the impression
they are making.”

The whole issue of feminine
identity was repeatedly stressed.
The students feel that a woman
creates a -better identity for her-
self by seeing men only on a
social basis; competition, they
say, “may tend to make a girl
masculine by her associations.”
This does not mean, however,
that Mount Mercy has no stu-
dent leaders. Esme O'Connor,
-student governor of Mount Mer-
cy, stated that “her school is
coming of age as an «institution
because of program develop-

ment study. It has changed from
a faculty-student organization to
strictly student government. The
student government hopes to
keep in step with the college
growth and development.”

Sister Rita, dean of residents,
had similar views to voice. “The
girls here can seek the highest
posts and develop their leader-
ship potentials without fear of
appearing aggressive. This par-
ticularly helps the girl Who is
shy in the presence of boys.
Some girls prefer the relaxa-
tion and concentration of a.n
all-girls’ school, while others
need a coeducational atmos-
phere.”

Frosh Advisors Get

Partial Participation
As Program Continues

The Freshman Advisor
Program is progressing be-
cause of the willingness of a
majority of the men to par-
ticipate, says William Marks,
assistant dean of men. “Be-
cause the program is voluntary,
they will lose men,” commented
Markus. But considering the
commuter element, and the sta-
tistics of 17 attending out of 20
the progress is good.

The program, which was ini-
tially begun by Chairman Ron
Cowell, Markus and a commit-
tee, is very ﬂexible. It is design-
ed as a continuation of orienta-
tion for freshman men and may
be compared to the Women’s
Mentor Program.

Groups of an average of'20
freshmen men meet with their
upperclass advisors to discuss
whatever they feel necessary.
Approximately 55 upperclass-
men have been chosen as advi-
sors. It was recommended that
the groups meet once a week,
but this is decided entirely by

The activities and discussions
are all spontaneous, ranging
from dorm life and fraternities

Markus feels that “the pro-
gram offers an opportunity for
freshmen men to meet and share
ideas with their peers while
providing relevant information
which was excluded during ori-
entation. There is a reinforce-
ment of orientation.

An important objective, claims
Markus, is “to provide a struc-
tured orientation to introduce
the freshmen to at least one up-
perclassmen to use as a resource
during the first term.

The reactions of the freshmen
to the program have been varied.
Markus explains that “some
have said that they like it,
whereas, others who live in
Pittsburgh consider it a waste.
However, the availability aspect
is good.”

Markus considers this a “pilot

Toward Immediate Action

The ﬁrst step has been taken by our State Legislature‘: Senate
Democratic Leader Ernest Kline’s announcement Monday that the Demo-
crats would supply needed votes for a House-approved increase in the
corporate net income tax provided that a $34 million appropriation for
college scholarships also is passed.

Although it is unlikely that the state-related institutions will re-
ceive their money in time to forestall borrowing, Kline’s statement sig-
nalled that ihe legislators have begun to tread the road of compromise
which will hopefully result in a tax program agreeable to both parties
in the near future.

In making his announcement, Kine stated that he was going along
with the corporation levy because “there is a need for the Commonwealth
to fulﬁll its commitments to the students and colleges in the scholarship
program.” We would like to carry his statement one step further and re-
iterate the commitment our Commonwealth has not only to the scholar-
ship students, but to the institutions of higher learning dependent upon
their state grants and the countless state programs awaiting their funds.

Senator Kline’s announcement indicates that the Democrats are
conceding on the corporate net income tax increase, but this is only one
small item in the tax program. Both parties must reach agreement on
every phase of this program as soon as possible if they are going to sal-

vage anythi_ g from the situation. Political fortunes, which we fear is the
overriding consideration of all to many of the active participants in this
hassle, can also be jeopardized by this incessant bickering which has
marked our State Government. One concession cannot camouflage the fact
that the major battles are yet to be fought.

’l‘he October 1 deadline after which time our University will be
forced to borrow between $5 to $6 million to meet its operating expenses
will obviously not be met. But we urge the legislators to quickly resolve
their differences and adpot a tax program. We also call upon Governor
{aymond P. Shafer to exert the leadership necessary to salvage what can
be salvaged of the situation.

Obviously, the Democrats will only compromise to the point. Both
parties should by now recognize that neither one will achieve a “victory”
in his own terms. But the situation has deteriorated to the point that any
decision reached will appear to be a victory, if only for the fact that it
proves a majority can agree on anything. "

Legislators did agree to raise their own salaries in the not too dis-
tant past. We now urge them to look beyond the conﬁnes of petty policies
and agree on a much more signiﬁcant ﬁnancial issue—the ﬁnancing of the
programs to which our state is committed.

  

  

Student Government Explains Stand

About The Student Union

AT THE ﬁrst meeting this
Fall of the Student Govern-
ment Senate, the Senate pass-
ed a bin entitled the “Omni-
bus Bill Concerning the Stu-
dent Union.” Since then
much has been said and
many questions have been
asked concerning the nature
of the bill and the topic of
the Student Union itself.

Before explaining the ideas
behind this bill and the ques-
tions it poses, the misinter-
pretations of this bill should
H5 ElE2i“'el€l tip:

It is not a personal attack
on the director of the Stu-
dent Union.

IT IS not a personal attack
against the Student Union
Board.

Everyone who has at all
been involved or in contact
with the various activities
sponsored by the Student
Union Board is aware that
there has been a great deal
of expansion in these activ-
ities and services in the past
few years and realize the
amount of work put into
them. The social and cultur-
al events sponsored by the
Student Union Board have
likewise increased in variety
and frequency in the past
few years.

The bill passed by Student
Government does not allege
that there has been gross
mismanagement of the phy-
sical facilities of the Student
Union nor does it allege that
the Student Union Board has
fiiled completely in its at-
tempts to provide activities
and events for the student
body.

WHAT the bill is saying is
that in recent months many
questions have been raised.
Some have been signiﬁcant,
greatly effecting the entire
student body; some have

been minor, effecting only a
a few students. It is merely
our opinion that now these
questions should be answer-

ed or at least investigated.
In many cases it is not that
the goal of an action was bad
but that the means used to
attain the goal either were
faulty or should have been
made _public. _In many cases
lack of communication com-
plicated the problems. The
overall administration of the
Student Union’s facilities is
not being questioned, only
those aspects that may have
adversely affected students
and student organizations.

One area where questions
have been raised is the allo-
cation -of office space to stu-
dent organizations. There is
no student involvement in
this room allocation and or-
ganizations can say nothing
after a change has been made.
Student Government has
been grossly effected in this
way. We were not informed
about our location change
until mid—August, although
the decision had been made
in July, and we have lost at
least four weeks getting
barely situated in our new
location, Room 305 of the
Student Union. Student Gov-
ernment does not propose
that students now be given
the ability to assign rooms.
Rather, we merely feel that
somewhere before any room
change decision be ﬁnalized
that some student represen-
tatives (s) be involved, which
is only fair.

Students have complained
to us over the past months
on another issue: the alloca-
tion of Activities Fee money
to the Student Union Board.
At the present time, the SUB
does not have to apply for
funds; instead, they automa-
tically receive money every
year. The point made is not
that the Student Union
Board is misusing the stu-
dent's money, but rather
that it is a student organi-
zation and they should, there-
fore, have to request funds

from the Student Govern-
ment Allocations Committee
like every other student or-
ganization.

DURING THE past sum-
mer the Student Union Board
requested that the name
of the «Student Union be
changed to the Pitt Union.
Then, going under the as-
sumption that the Universi-
ty’s Trustees would enact
the name change, which they
haven’t, the Student Union
Board changed its name to
the Pitt Union Board. SG
Senators and others asked
by what basis did a group
that does not represent any
students but themselves re-
quest such a change, and
representing any students
why didn’t they apply to the
SG Committee on Student
Organizations to have their
organization’s name change
validated?

The last topic to be men-
tioned here is the ID Card
service, presently located on
the third ﬂoor of the Student
Union. The question “Why is
this service found in the Stu-
dent Union instead of in the

» Cathedral of Learning under
the jurisdiction of the Regis-
trar (Student Records?” has
been raised. Aside from its
questionable efficiency, it is
occupying two rooms that
formerly belonged to student
organizations. ~

Rooms 320, 321, 323 and

324 are now occupied by Stu-
dent Union administration
personnel, whereas before,
student organizations had of-
ﬁces there. The question ask-
ed are: Must all four rooms
be so utilized: Can’t they
somehow be rearranged so
that once again student
groups may use just a cou-
ple of them?

These are some of the
more important questions
that have been raised in the
past months. “The Omnibus
Bill Concerning the Student
Union” is an attempt to bring
them out in the open before
the student body because
they do effect, everyone of
as. The purpose of this bill,
therefore, is not to. embarass
a few individuals or to gain
a few shrunked heads as vic-
tory souvenirs. Student Gov-
ernment’s goal is a Student’s
Union.

Senator Defends
New Juke Box

Editor, 'l.‘l':e Pitt News:

The letter decrying the juke
box in the Tuck Shop is another
example of many students’ ten-
dency to blame anyone and ev-
eryone without ﬁnding out the
facts. Sag-'1 Food was not, I re-
peat, was not responsible for
putting a juke box in the Tuck
Shop. I was.

As a Student Government sen-
ator, I was approached by a
group of students concerning
what they felt to be the dreari-
ness and lack Olf atmosphere in
the Tuck Shop. They claimed
that they wanted something to
put music and liveliness into
the Tuck Shop, and suggested
a juke box. They asked if I
would see if I could arrange to
have one installed. I worked
closely with the Saga adminis-
trators. It took four months to
make arrangements, and in that
time I developed a profound re-
spect for Mr. Maciag and Mr.
Polash, the men from Saga
whom I worked with. I told

.iem that this was something
the students wanted, and they
did their best to accommodate.

Now as to the arguments pre-
sented against the juke box.
Firstly, the music does not “re-
sound” through the Tuck Shop,
nor does it ﬁlter out into the
halls. In fact, I have had at
least ten students come to me
asking if extra speakers could
be installed because they could
not hear the music. Secondly, as
a place to -study, the crowded
conditions and noise before the
installtion of the juke box pre-
*lud»ed any study whatsoever. I’
someone wan-ts tolstudy, there
are areas set aside for this, as
for the music making it neces-
sary to shout, hogwash. If the
students who wrote the com-
plaint found it necessary to
shout to be heard, I suggest
they remove their ears from
next to tZ:ic.- speaker. That is the
only way that the juke box could
have possibly drowned out their
speech.

This was something that was
done for the students, not against
them. If the majority of stu-
dents did not like the juke box,
they would not continue to put
in dimes, nickels, and quarters
to keep the music playing. If

students have complaints, send
them to me in care of Student
Government. If they want quiet,

Commuters Rap
News Coverage.

Editor, The Pitt News:

We, the undersigned, have
been commuting to Pitt for two
years, and we are attempting to
make it three in a row. We feel
that commuting (no, it is not a
dirty word!) is not as bad as
ieaders of the Pitt News have
been 1-ed to believe. In fact, there
are several distinct advantages:
(1) No curfews, (,2) Good food,
(3) Better maid service. Also,
many lucky commuters have
cars, which greatly alleviate the
54C bus -problem.

We cite the following as evi-
dence that the Pitt News does
nothing to enhance the commut-
er’s position in the University:
(1) The “exciting” adventures of
“The Dorm Rat,” (2) The ima-
ginative picture in the center
pages and the “appropriate” cap-
tions, (3) Undeserved eulogies
to unkonwn commuters.

If the University feels cheat-
ed by the decreasing number of
out-of-staters, it should not al-
low The Pitt News to satirize
the commuters. In closing, we

‘Pitt News’ Review

 

 

  Cast Rates High in “Once Upon a Mattress”

Every female in the audi-
ence wanted to know where
they got Walt Hunter. Every
male in the audience wanted
to know where they got J ac-
quelin Mathews, but every-
one knew where they got
Judy Knaiz.

This was the situation at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse on
Friday night for a preview
performance of Once Upon
a Mattress, which opened the
following night. For seldom
does one ﬁnd such a ﬁne col-
lection of performers on any
stage. Working with a mediocre
script and music, the Playhouse
cast makes this musical come-
dy a fast-moving, and entertain-
ing production.

The plot of this musical is
based on Hans Christian Ander-
son’s fairy tal-e in which a prin-
cess is placed on 20 mattresses
with a pea hidden under the
first. If the alleged princess

sleeps well, she is a fake.

Judy Knaiz, as Princess VVoe-
hegone, fails to sleep but does
not fail in her performance. The
role was originally written for
Carol Burnett, but Miss Knaiz
performs ablely as the ugly
duckling princess who journeys
from her home in the swamps
to win the handsome prince
from his own domineering mo-
ther.

The true test of Miss Knaiz’s
talent comes in a scene where
she is left alone on the stage on
the 20 mattresses. For ﬁve min-
utes, she keeps the audience
laughing with What seem to be
ad libbed sight gags.

Princess Woebegone is brought
from the swamps by Sir Henry.
He is anxious to ﬁnd a bride
for the prince, for until the
prince marries, no one else in
the kindom may Wed. Sir Henry
is in a particular hurry because
his own fiance is pregnant.

As Sir Henry, Walt Hunter is
the perfect knight in shining
armor. Although his singing

Broken Hand Sidelines W

Bacl<field’s Best Blocker

by ROY JACOBS
Some guys have all the luck. Last year, on the opening
kickoff of the West Virginia freshman game, John White,

White survived Saturday’s kickoff against UCLA all right, but on
the varsity’s second offensive play, he broke his hand. This time

against UCLA in Saturday’s football opener.’

. Orszulak Returns

Hart Adjusts Backfield

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor
Dave Hart doesn’t plan any drastic changes in the Pan-

ther lineup for Loyalty Day.

Although not a national holiday, Loyalty Day is a
venture by Illinois Athletic Director Gene Vance to boost atten—
dance and student spirit for Saturday's intersectional contest.

Vance wants to ge-t the Illini turned around after Florida
drenched them in 100 degree temperature for a 14-0 win, ‘but Hart

has only to adjust his backﬁeld.

With starting fullback John
White, a 6-4, 204 pound sopho-
more, deﬁnitely out of action for
a month with a fractured right
hand, Hart moved senior Mike
Raklewicz back to his old spot.

Reserve wingback Jerry Rife,
injured since the ﬁrst day of
practice, was moved to the tail-
back position. Returning from
the injured list is junior tailback
Skip Orszulak. He missed‘ the
UCLA defeat because of a
shoulder injury.

Hart is also considering Paul

‘Bergman at the tailback spot.

Gary Cramer, who averaged
3.5 yards a carry against the
Bruins, is. listed at fullback be-

hind Raklewicz in Hart’s shake-

up.

Unlike UCLA, Illinois doesn’t
have great individual stars. And
according to Panther coach Stan
Zajdel, who scouted them, “If
our team is able to compete phy-
sically, there’s a possibility we
could be in the ball game.”

Although the Illinois defense
limited Florida to only 22 yards
rushing during the ﬁrst half,
the Illini ﬁrst year coach Jim
Valek has had problems with
defensive halfbacks.

Besides two starters who com-
pleted their eligibility, Valek

‘ saw his third regular sign a

professional baseball contract.
Then a letterman reserve ﬂunk-

ed off the team while two sopho-

appendectomies.

This forced Valek to move his
co-captains, Ken Kmiec, two
year regular -at defensive end,
and Ron Bess, two year offen-
sive backﬁeld regular, into the
secondary.

Hart, who has had th-at kind
of trouble with his offensive
backs, only hopes quarterback
Frank Gustine and split end
Bob Longo can capitalize on Va-
lek’s problems come Loyalty
Day.

Against UCLA, Gustine com-
pleted nine of 19 passes for 83
yards. And Bolb Longo needs
only nine receptions for the all
time scho-ol mark for passes re-
ceived in a career.

Soccermen
Polish Attack
For MSU

With a lack of scoring
punch in their ﬁrst two
games, and numerous in-
juries, the soccer team practices
this week for the season's tough-
est game against Michigan State.

The impotent offense hurt the
booters in their ﬁrst two en-
counters. The kickers have been
shut out twice. Coach Leo Be-mis
hopes former freshman star Bob
Trexler or senior Gary Foerstch,
who scored «a few clutch goals
last. year, or Ernest Mouen can
become top scorers. Mouen is
hampered by a severely sprain-
ed ankle.

According to Bemis, “We must
be in the -best condition both
mentally and physically to win
against Michigan State.” Bemis
rates Michigan ‘State as the
“team to beat for the national
title.” _

Bemis has not decided if ‘he
will keep his conventional four

man defense, three linemen, and
three halfback formation, or
switch to a “W” or 5-2-3 forma-'
tion. Bemis used the “W” at-
tack in the second half.

he’ll miss a month of the season. _
Even more amazing is that after suffering the broken hand,

VVhite carried the ball twice for
gains of 11 and 13 yards.

“On the ﬁrst play I carried
the ball I was kind of nervous,”
he remembered afterwards. “I
started to lose the b-all and I
went after it. Just as the tack-
l-er came in, I hit his helmet with
my hand. That’s probably when
it happened.”

However, White didn’t real-
ize he was hurt until three plays
later when he tried to set him-
self in his stance.

“It only hurt when I got
down,” he said. “I was so in-
volved in the game I didn’t no-
tice it. It didn't hurt till I got
out of the game. I noticed the
swelling when I was sitting on
the bench.”

White was ﬁnished for the af-
ternoon and for the most part

~so were the Panthers. Besides

Mike Raklewicz, the offensive
backﬁeld was left with only
three sophomores.

“All week Raklewicz and I
ran the plays in practice, and
the others didn’t do much,” ex-
plained White. “I guess they
(the coaches) didn't expect us
to get hurt.” Gary Cramer re-
placed White, but Cramer usual-
ly a tailback, wasn’t too familiar

“When Skip Orszulak got hurt
I was surprised that they moved
Raklewicz to tailback,” said
White. “They used me as full-
back mainly because I can block.
Fullback is a sort of sophisti-
cated guard position. When they
told me I was going to carry
the ball on the ‘ﬁrst play, a hun-
dred and one things started go-
ing through my mind.”

But the one question that per-
sists is how did John manage
to gain those 24 yards after he
broke his hand?

“When going through the line,
you hold the ball with two
hands,” explained White, demon-
strating as he spoke. “When
straightening up, I most likely
would have put the ball under
my left arm to straight- arm
tacklers with my right arm.”

It sounds like a story from
the Knute Rockne era, this full-
back ripping off ﬁrst downs
while playing with a broken
hand. To White it’s neither
amazinlg nor funny. He’s hop-
ing for some better luck next
time.

T-entlivie Lineup Fixed Random, Litchfield Win;

 

As Cubs Await WVU

by JERRY GRUBEL
“Our kids have been spending a great deal of time with
the varsity,” freshman football coach Darrell Lewis warns,”
“so I'm not sure how well prepared they’ll be. But I do feel they
have outstanding potential. We’ll ﬁnd out more Saturday evening.”

Saturday's opener will be play-
ed at Ambridge High School
Stadium. The opponents will be
the West Virginia frosh, who are
directed by coach Dale Evans.

Lewis hasn’t received any in-
formation from West Virginia.
“All I know,” Lewis said, “is

, that West Virginia beat a sup-

posedly strong VPI team, 35-12,
and a boy by the name of Stan-
ley accounted for 148 yards in
the air.”

Lewis still hasn’t decided up-
on his starting lineup. Most
likely, however, his defensive
unit will consist of ends Bill
Kennedy, 6-6, 225, and Bruce
Harkiewicz, 6-3, 215; tackles
Howard Broadhead, 6-5, 245, and
Tom Porrcca, 6-3, 217; lineback-
ers Ralph Cindrrich, 6-1, 230,
Lloyd Weston, 6-2, 220, and John
Wozniak, 5-10, 200; and half-
backs Bill Ramos, Charlie Hall,
Bill Pietrantonio, and Dave Hav-

‘ ern.

Offensively, the Panther Cubs
will have exceptional speed.
Wingback Dave Garn.ett has
run the hundred in 9.5; tail-
back Mike Connell has run it
in 9.7; and split end Bill Pil-
conis was the Pennsylvania state
low hurdles champion.

The remainder of the Cub of-
fense will most likely be han-
dled by quarterback Don Plus-
quellic, fullback Tony Esposito,
tight end Bob Jouret, tackles
Jerry Leary and John Stevens,
guards Ed Sinesky and Bryant
Seltzer, and center Ken Shu-
maker.

The Cubs will be practicing
all week. Overall, their defen-
sive unit is big, and their of-
fensive unit has plenty of speed.
Lewis will ﬁnd out just how
good and how ready his team
actually is Saturday.

 

Pathetics Rout Fanatics, 9-1

Two slugfests highlighted
Monday’s Dorm softball ac-
tion as Litchﬁeld outlasted the
Peanut Gallery, 11-8, and Ran-
dom kayoed Hawthorne, 17-8.
House of Lords lost its second
game, a forfeit win for Panther
House.

Litchﬁeld, behind 8-0 after
four innings, exploded for eight
runs in the ﬁfth, and then
scored three more in the sixth
to Win.

Bob Volken paced Litchﬁeld’s
16 hit attack with three hits and
two runs. Larry Lindquist got
two hits and also scored twice.
Gary Means had a homer, dou-
ble, and single in four at bats
for the Peanuts.

Gil Burckhart’s grand-slam
homer in the second inning gave
Random House a lead which
they never relinquished against
Hawthorne. Ra.ndom's 22-hit of-

Student tickets can still be
purchased for the freshman
football team’s opening game
against West Virginia. Tick-
ets cost $1 and can be bought
at the Field House office or at
the game.

The contest is being played
in Ambridge. To travel to the
game, go through North Side
Pittsburgh to Ohio River Blvd.
Follow that for 25 miles right
into Ambridge.

fensive included three singles, a
double, and a walk in ﬁve trips
for Ron Mancuso. He also scored
four runs. Ron Randall added a
three-run homer. Bob Folk hom-
ered for Hawthorne.

In the Independent League,
the Pathetfcs routed the Fana-
tics, 9-1, while the Rag Mops for-
feited to the Chem Grads, thus
eliminating the Mops from com-
petition.

A new league has been organ-
ized this year. It is comprised
of cadets from the ROTC Bri-
gade and it follows the same IM
format as the established groups.
