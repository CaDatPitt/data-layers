Pitt alumnus Kenneth Loveis documentary shows the life of The Pittsburgh Courier during the civil rights movement

For The PItt News

Robert Lavelle_ will never forget
his ﬁrst day‘ at The Pittsburgh
Courier. _ , '

It was September, 24, 1935, the
day black boxerjoe Louis knocked
out the heavyweight champion,
Max Baer. People from across the
country began calling The Cou-
rier requesting copies of its match
coverage. - -

The Courier, a Hill District-
based paper that ran from 1907
to 1965, was one of the most in-
ﬂuential black newspapers ingthe
history of the United States.

Tonight, Pitt alumnus Kenneth

. Love will unveil his documentary

about the paper in a private recep-
tion Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other University ofﬁcials are
expected to attend.

The documentary, “The Pitts-
burgh Courier, 1907-1965,” tells
the story of the paper using vintage
images and narration from several
of the newspaper’s former editors

- and reporters, including Pitt alum-

nus Lavelle.

“The Pittsburgh Courier meant
everything to me,” Lavelle said. “It
took me out of a dishwasherjob. I
wanted to be the best that I could
be at The Courier so one dayl could

V be one of those guys that was run-

ning the paper.”

Lavelle ﬂashed back to his ﬁrst
“day” at The Courier. While some
of the workers were receiving an

inﬂux of callers, the editors were
delaying production, trying to

‘work a picture from the historical .

boxing match into the paper.
Lavelle spent hours answering
phone calls, until the staff went to

the YMCA across the street to get
, four hours of sleep. -Lavellecamel
. back to spend several more hours
wrapping newspapers, which The
‘Courier would ship across the «

country. At 19—years—old, Lavelle
worked a 27-hour day. He worked

‘80 hours his ﬁrst week, and he

raked in $10 for his labor.
Lavelle would eventually move

‘ from the mail room and office to

the accounting department during

his 21-year career. During World '

War II, he was drafted into the
U.S. Army, during which time The
Courier launched the “Double V”
Campaign. '

I The “Double V” Campaign,
which stood for “Democracy: Vic-_
tory at _Home, Victory Abroad,”
pushed for civil rights for blacks.
The goal was to defeat Adolph
Hitler and Jim Crow laws. This
eventually sparked an investiga-
tion by then—F.B.I. Director]. Edgar
Hoover, who wanted to shut the
paper down and charge some of
its workers with sedition. .

“The paper had two functions,”
Pitt professor Laurence Glasco
said. “One function was to pro-
test discrimination, segregation,
injustices, and the other function
was to highlight and feature the
positives that were going on inside
of the community.”

yesterday to support the victims
of the earthquake that devastated
Haiti almost three weeks ago.

The Redeemed. Christian
Church of God held the service
along with the Union of African
Communities in Pittsburgh and
Allegheny County in the Hosanna
House in Wilkinsburg.

Music from a pair of hand V

drums, a drum set and a pair of
keyboards ﬁlled the hall. A Pow-

the songs up on a screen for the
audience to follow along.

A small choir in front of the
seats sang and encouraged the
audience to participate.

needed to get involved in rebuild-

“As bad as it looks now, there
can be life there again. We need

‘ to be involved in that,” Emeremni '

said.

More than 100 parishioners‘

shared their thoughts and prayers
for the victims of the earthquake
in Haiti. The parishioners joined
Emeremni and her fellow singers
yesterday. Many danced in their
seats to the music.

More than a dozen children
played between the aisles when
the service began, adding to the
din in the hall.

a.ml and shortly after 10:30 a.m.,
Pastor Adegboyega Esan stepped
to the podium and started his ser-

' ’_ “It does not matter how devas-

-' V  tated Haiti is, it will bounce back.
It will rise again,” Esan said.

- . The text of Ezekiel 37 lit up the
screen as Esan talked on dry bones
and “God’s specialty of bringing ,
life to the dead.” ’

- But,~=,Esan said, Haiti’s recovery
wouldn’t happen spontaneously.
Mankind would have to help for
Haiti to “rise again.” .

“Without God we cannot. With-
out man, God will not,” Esan said
of the need for people to pitch in
for the Haiti relief effort.

Ruﬁis Idris, general secretary
for the Union of African Commu-
nities in Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County, said that they planned the
event over the past two weeks as
a way to raise awareness for the
Haiti relief effort.

A news release for the event

said representatives from the Red .

Cross would be present to take do-
nations. , ,
Brian Knavish, a spokesman for

— the Southwestern Pennsylvania
. Red Cross, said that the Red Cross
. has seen an immense. outpouring of .

support from the community, but
hadn’t heard of the event. \

Idris said he thought the service
was a success.

At the end of the service ushers
passed around baskets to collect
donations for the Red Cross Haiti
relief effort. The groups collected
more than $500 in a small gray
metal box to bring to the Red Cross
in Pittsburgh. _

_Six leaders from a variety of Af-
rican nations founded the Union of
African Communities in Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County in 2008.
The Union includes representa-
tives from 26 African nations and
several student groups from the
Pittsburgh area.

s Haiti victims

The Union lists support from
Pitt’s African Student Organiza-
tion, CMU’s Young African Leader’s
Alliance, and Duquesne’s African
Student Organization. «

Idris said that the goal of the
Union was to “respond as one peo-
ple whether it is a happy time or a
disastrous time, like this one.”

“Many Haitians are of African
descent. They are our people,” Id-
ris said of the Union’s involvement
in the Haiti relief effort.

More events will depend on
the needs of the Haitian people,
Idris said. He had received calls
from people who wanted to donate
clothing and food.

But, according to the Red Cross
Web site, the organization is “un~
able to accept small, individual
donations or collections of -items
such as clothing, food, cleaning
supplies and medicine.” ’

In the torrid jungles of Burma,
Bolden wrote about the black engi-
neering troops who died working
on the Burma Road. He denounced
claims that black people would ﬂee
combat while covering soldiers in
Italy. V

Bolden’s most famous series
traced the complete histories of
eight prominent black families
who came to the country in 1728

by tracking down all living rela-'

tives and telling their stories.
Bolden worked in a time when

Pittsburgh, likelmost of the na-

. tion, was marked by segregation.

Blacks could not dine Downtown,
try on clothes Downtown, or sit in
the same seating area in theaters.
There was no media outlet for the
black community, and the white
newspapers did not shed any posi-
tive light on blacks, Glasco said.

“Nationally this period is known
as the nadir period, meaning that
it was low point in history,” Glasco
said. “It was a period of greatest
racial violence. Lynching,Jim Crow
laws were put in full effect and the
Supreme Court ruling on segrega-
tion.”

The Courier, which would reach
more than 250,000 people in 14
cities, pushed for full racial inte-
gration prior to World War II, giv-
ing ample coverage to segregated
black men in the military. One of
the ﬁrst stories was of a black mess
attendant who voluntarily defend-
ed the battleship Arizona without
machine gun training.

The Courier also crusaded
against the American Red Cross
ban on blood donations from black

‘people. Called the “Race Blood

Myth,” the paper often placed a
series of blood ban stories on its
front page.

The paper’s coverage of wider,
national events caught the atten-
tion of American presidents. Lyn-
don B.]ohnson’s favorite cartoon,

which hung in the Oval Oﬁice, was, '

said to beone by The Courier’s Sam

Milai. Milai drew several cartoons -

aboutjohnson, which are now on
display in the Lyndon B. Johnson
Presidential Library. ,
But it was the paper’s local cov-
erage of church events, parties and

r nightclubs that won Hill District

residents’ loyalty. V _ _r . .
Wylie Avenue, the predomi-

nately black neighborhood of the

Hill District, had a lively nightlife.

Courier covered national events, racial injustice

The Hill District glory days were .
from the 1930s to 1950s, and re- L

porters such as Bolden covered
the Hill that never seemed to go
to bed. '

Self-taught photographer
Charles “Teenie” Harris, who
became a legend in the journal-
ism community, shot more than
80,000 pictures of the Wylie Av-
enue scene when whites and blacks
were dressing up and ﬂooding the
clubs.

ﬁnancially. It reemerged and con-

tinues to live on today in the form

Editorial

Nuclear Power
good for Pitt, US

dress, President Barack Obama

In his State of the Union ad-
delivered his most pertinent

statement on nuclear energy since '

he took office. A new generation
of nuclear power plants, and the

clean—energy jobs that will result, '

hinge on $54 billion in additional
loan guarantees for nuclear energy,
part of his 2011 budget request to
Congress last Monday.

The Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission enables the nation to safely
use radioactive materials for ben-
eﬁcial civilian purposes, while
ensuring safety to people and the

environment during its use. Obama _

designated the chairman of the
NRC in 2009. Public funding for
nuclear energy related endeavors
have often been awarded by this
agency. V
A In August 2008, Pitt received
$750,000 of the $20 million desig-
nated as Nuclear Education Grants
from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission, one of 60 recipient insti-
tutions. The grants augmented the
nuclear engineering undergraduate
and graduate certiﬁcate programs.
In November 2009, the NRC award-
ed Pitt a $400,000 grant to support
two graduate fellowships within the
same ﬁeld.

Obama has had a distinctive

grassroots approach to many of

the issues he addresses. Nuclear
energy is no different. Pitt has
been recognized substantially for
its nuclear engineering programs
from the NRC, considering its pro-
gram is not quite three-years- old. If
Obama is true to his past, Pitt and
other institutions might see even
more funding for this new energy
he is endorsing. _

Training people to work in this
ﬁeld is just as important as creating
those nuclear reactors and making

nuclear energy a more viable op-
tion than it presently is.

As students at Pitt, and inhal_Jit- .

ants of Pittsburgh, it is important to
appreciate nuclear energy for what
it is, and to understand the con-

cerns about it. Looking at the Uni- ’ 1
versity’s latest accomplishments, . -

the city of Pittsburgh could regain
a title as an energy—central city.

As far as_ safety is concerned,
nuclear power plants might not be
as destructive as their name sug-
gests. According to the American
Nuclear Society, a not-for-proﬁt
scientiﬁc and educational organiza-
tion unifying professional activities
in nuclear science and technology,
plants do not explode like nuclear
bombs, as some assume. A reactor
is not built like a weapon.

Nuclear energy is not harmful
to the environment, the ANS sug-
gests. The energy-creating process
does not involve the emission of
greenhouse gasses, being as clean
as solar and wind energy sources.
Yes, waste is still produced, but
President Obama seems to have
other plans in mind to dispose of
it, suggesting closing down Yucca
Mountain in the Nevada desert, a
burial ground for waste.

A new energy source would also
reduce the nation’s dependency on
foreign oil. The electricity gener-
ated can directly power the increas-
ing number of hybrid cars avail-
able, and even electrically powered
mass—transit. Having a long—term
scope of nuclear energy’s integra-
tion intolsociety is important to
realize its possibilities.

If the president succeeds in
pushing nuclear energy, and re-
search and power plant creation is-
funded, Pitt can be proud it will be
at the forefront of the next possible
energy renaissance.

A few weeks ago, it, came out that
another sports hero was some-
thing less than heroic. Mark McG-
wire admitted to using steroids
intermittently for a decade, in-
cluding the year in which he broke
the record for most home runs in
a season. Of course, that record
was later beaten by another man
of unusual size, Barry Bonds.

nizing about what the kids think
of sports stars would make a heap
of sense right about now.

The standard response to the
question, “What about the chil-
dren?” is that idolizing sports
stars is a stupid waste of time, and
kids should be busy worshipping
people that are more productive.
However, as much as I would love
to see heated discussionsabout
Linus Pauling rookie cards, there
is a certain logic to having kids
follow sports stars, and it is some-
thing parents should not neces-

‘sarily discourage.

Sports stars make for easy ad-

miration. Their feats, like turning ‘

seem superhuman.

These feats are easily under-
standable, and concrete. They_
are especially understandable
to boys brought up, -not only
playing sports, but taught to be
competitive while playing them.
Having the technique of Heifetz
or the sonority of Chaliapin or the
whimsy of Twain are not accom-
plishments as visceral or obvious

as the ability to crush a ball with-
a bat or return an interception '

100 yards.

Sports develop character. Eth-
ics such as hard work, mental
toughness, fair play and sports-
manship are learned, and the
results of behaving ethically are
concrete and relatively immedi-
ate. If our sports stars behave in
a good manner, then we have a
screaming endorsement of those

ethics: you can behave just like

this person, and look at the suc-
cess that might result.
Finally, and most importantly:

we want to believe that athletes
are just like us, that what sepa-

rates them from us is only talent._

A ence betweenjames Madison and

I was ultimately just a name, a
lot of hard work, sportsmanship,
mental toughness‘ and so on. This
idea makes sense to young minds,
before they learn about genetic
predisposition and performance-
enhancing substances and Calvin-,

ism. “Do your homework because .

Mark Teixeira did his,” logical
fallacy though it is, has appeal.
In the abstract, sports stars
are not bad role models: they are
people who we believe are not

' ‘ that different from the rest of us,
they do superhuman things that’ ’

are easily understandable, and it
is easy to believe that success has
more to dovwith ethics than with
innate talent. The ﬂy in the “spe—
cial” ointment is that athletes re-
ally are people like the rest of us. V
They fall into the same troubles
with drugs, alcohol, sex, firearms
and the temptation to cheat. The
only difference is that when a ran-
dom student gets drunk in South
Oakland, or a random philanderer

paper in the country.

So, what do we do‘? It would
be a mistake to discourage kids
from idolizing sportsfolk be-
cause they’ll,do so anyway. What
parents should ‘do is talk to their
children. Make it clear who is to
be idolized for what, and make
it clear that all people are admi-

' rable in some respects, but not in
others. Strive to hit like Ty Cobb,.
.don’t hit people like Ty Cobb.

Finally, parents should try to
develop a new set of idols for their
children to follow. Teach them
to value a job well—done, like a

studio. He’s moving because he “couldn’t make

“Up and coming art majors and artists need
to be aware of the difficulty of life after gradu-
ation,” said Stephen Hankin, an adjunct studio
arts professor.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates
that 60 percent of the 221,900 artists working
in the United States are self—employed.

Students should realize the types of ad-
justments necessary to stay aﬂoat in_ the real

 

world, Hankin said.,He suggested that cur-
rent art majors should think about where
they want to bein ﬁve or 10 years. He asks
students to contemplate the answers toa few
key questions: Do they wish to support a fam-
ily someday? How resourceful are they? Can
they network?
Some art majors say they don’t intend to
use their degrees to ﬁnd a job.
Justin Tay, a Pitt freshman, is a studio arts
and molecular biology major.

“I want to go medical school and be a doc-

I chose to get a double degree,” Tay said.

He hopes to incorporate art into a career
as a plastic surgeon.

“I personally don’t think I could do a full-
time career in art. I think teaching is the only
way to get a steady career with my art degree,”
he said. .

Spring careerfair offers job opportunities

Amid recession worries, Pitt student seek employment.

John Manganaro

Staﬂ” Writer-

Pitt’s Spring 2010 Career Fair expects about
150 employers and a lot of competition.
“While the economy is certainly making
it more difficult to add jobs, we are going to
have multiple positions to ﬁll at Pitt’s career
fair this year — at least one or two,” Doug
Colafella said. Colafella isthe manager of
external communications for Allegheny En-
ergy, a utility company providing electricity
to more than 1.5 million people across Penn-
sylvania, West Virginia and Maryland. _
His company represents one of about
150 employers expected to be at next week’s
career fair, which will be held Feb. 10 and 11
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. . _
Allegheny Energy will be looking primar-
ily for electrical engineers, Colafella said.
“We like to come to Pitt every spring and
offer talented students an opportunity to
succeed in the energy business,” he said.
“We have established a solid relationship
with Pitt through the career fair program,
and we plan to continue to work closely with
Pitt students.” '

The ﬁrst day of this year’s career fair will
feature Colafella’s company, as well as other
employers in the technical sector —— includ-
ing engineering, computer and information
science ﬁelds. The next day will focus on
non—technical work like business, arts and
health sciences. ,

The Ofﬁce of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance organizes the fair and
is encouraging students to pre—register for

the semi—annual event on my.pitt.edu. Stu-

dents who sign up early will receive an ad-
vanced copy of the directory, which includes
information about the fair and attending
employers. _

Monica Varela, special events and market-

ing coordinator forlthe oﬂice, said students

who plan to attend the career fair should
research the companies they are interested
in working for and prepare questions to ask
the company representatives.

“Asking informed, educated questions
demonstrates initiative to a prospective em-
ployer,” Varela said. “Most of the employers
attending the fair are looking to hire now,
and others will be recruiting for positions
that they anticipate opening up at a later
date. Networking will be a key part of get-
ting hired.” 

Varela" advised students who are looking
to improve their networking skills to partici-
pate in this week’s Career Kickoff,‘ a three—day
event being held Tuesday through Thursday
in various locations across campus. ,

The Career Kickoff will feature resumé
workshops and information sessions provid-
ing networking tips from local employers.

More information about these events is avail— '

able on the SEPA website, Varela said. '
New at this year’s fair will be a mini‘-net-
working exhibition for students majoring in
creative ﬁelds, she said. Interested students
can discuss industry trends with profession-
als and discuss how to “make it” in these
competitive ﬁelds. '
But students attending the career fair
should not just be looking for jobs, said

' Trisha Ross, program relations coordinator

at the Regional Internship Center of South-
western Pennsylvania.
The Regional Internship Center brokers

connections between internship seekers and I

employers throughoutthe region and will
attend the fair. Ross said that more than 90
percent of the interns her organization works
with are Pitt students, many of whom con-
nect with the center during career fairs.
“Of course, at a career fair most students

are only thinking about landing a job, but

internships are becoming almost a necessary
step in securing any long—term employment,” -

Ross said. “If you secure an internship you
can tell prospective employers that you have
more real—world experience than ﬂipping
burgers or cutting grass.” ‘

She also gave advice about networking.

“Students should avoid cruising around
a job fair with a group of friends,” she said.
“Approaching tables individually shows a
level of maturity and ability.” g

“It may be obvious, but one of the most
important steps a prospective employee can
take is to dress appropriately,” she said. “At
every career fair we go to, we always see a few
students who aren’t dressed appropriately.
They don’t really stand a chance of making
any valuable contacts.” '

Ross also stressed the importance of a
presenting a strong resumé, which includes
both a telephone number and an e-mail ad-
dress. _ l

“Many students think that by only put-
ting their cell phone number on a resume
they will actually get to talk to a prospective
employer,” she said. “But without an e—mail
address, a resume is incomplete, and it will
go straight in the garbage.” '

Career services explained

Tonyjovenitti
Staff Writer

Navigating Career Services used to be simple —
until the office split in two.

The change, which happened in-2008, sepa-
rated the Career Development Ofﬁce, from the
Student Employment and Placement Assistant
Office.

ShawnAhearn, director of communications for
Student Affairs, said, “CDO works with students
to help prepare them for a career, and SEPA is
the oﬂice that’s going to actually help them get
the jo .”

Pitt felt that career development and place-
ment were so crucial that there needed to be two
different specialties, Aheam said.

Students should use the Career Development
Office if they “have not yet determined a career
plan,” said Barbarajuliussen, associate director
of the Career Development Office.

“We help students get ready for their graduat-
ingyear,” she said. U

The CareerDevelopment Oﬁice helps students

pickamajor,changeamajoi;buildaresumé,prac- .

tice interviewing and explore internship opportu-
nities.Abrochure available inthe oﬁicehasachart
that tells students what they must do, should do
and could do during all four years of college to
prepare for their careers.

The Student Employment and Placement
Assistance Ofﬁce works on the other end of the

career-searchspectrum,focusinglargelyonhe1p-

muses:

ing graduating seniors ﬁnd jobs.

“With SEPA, like its name says, helps with
placemen ” Aheam said. “They work with clif-
ferent companies to bring recruiters to campus
and offer internships opportunities.”

SEPA hosts three career fairs and a Career
Kickoff event in both the spring and fall semes-
ters. About 150 employers are expectedto attend

the spring_ career fair, which will be on Feb. 10'

and 11.

The office also provides employment special-
ists who focus on ﬁnding jobs and internships in
many different ﬁelds. 1

SEPA also hosts networking events, where
students can gain OCC credit.

“They even do on—campus employment, such
aswork study,” Ahearn said.

The two otﬁces, however, are by no means
mutually exclusive. Juliussen said they work to-
gether very closely.

They tendto overlap when discussing intem—
ships, which can be used both as career planning
andto help with career placement. The internship
coordinator works in the Student Employment
and Placement Assistance Oﬂice.

“But [the internship coordinator] is avaluable
resource to [the CDO],”Juliussen said. “Because
students need to do an internship long before

p their graduating year.”

Interview skills a

must for new hires

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

It’s the scariest and most important part
of a job hunt —— theinterview.

However, college graduates can prepare
themselves so that they don’t meet their
employers empty handed.

Justin Kelly, a career and employment
counselor at the Career Development Cen-
ter of Jewish Family & Children’s Service
in Squirrel Hill, said applicants should

be able tosell themselves — and their

experiences. _

“More than anything, relevant experi-
ence islwhat gets not_iced'on résumés,”
Kelly said. V '

. These exp‘erien'ces-can include intern-
ships, involvement in student organiza-
tions and part—time jobs, he said.

How to prepare

You can prepare yourself for the job
market by learning how to sell your “trans—

' gferable skills,” Kelly said. These include

leadership, teamwork and customer ser-

vice. Before the interview, you can think V

of all the experiences that demonstrate
these skills and examples of times when
you had to use them.

Students planning on going into certain
ﬁelds might expect unusual questions from

. their potential employers.

Kelly said that sometimes, employers
could ask applicants “bizarre” questions to
test skills they can’t otherwise observe.

For instance, people applying for con-
sulting jobs might get “case interview
questions,” Kelly said. One example might
be, “How many ping—pong balls fit into a
747 jet?” A I

He said employers will ask these ques-
tions to test applicants’ thought processes
to see how they break down a problem and
come to a logical conclusion.

Another type of question applicants
can be aware of is the “stress interview”
question. -

Kelly said an employer, such as those
in a retail establishment, might ask this
to focuson an applicant’s behavior while
he or she answers the question.

The employer might ask if the applicant
has stolen anything on the job before and
then see if the person gets stressed out,
changes eye contact or ﬁdgets.

People applying for creative posi-
tions should bring a portfolio, Kelly said.
It might be a hard copy or an electronic

one. . ~
“It’s great to be able to discuss it, but
it’s even better to show your creativity,

‘ whether it’s written or in graphic form.”

Students can also prepare by seeking
professional help, either through Pitt or
private_f1rms.' ’

The Career Development Office at Pitt
offers ‘career counseling for students, in-
cluding resumé help, internship advice
and mock interviews. You can schedule an
appointment in advance or come to the of-
ﬁce’s walk-in hours fromflo a.m., to 4 p.m_.
for resumé advice oriamock interview. _

If you make an appointment early into
your college career, Career Development
counselors can help youdecide ona major,
plan for internships and network.

Kelly said mock interviews are‘impor-
tant — you might even want to videotape
yourself to see the mannerisms and body
language that you use.

And another part of preparing for the
interview actually occurs after the inter-
view.

You should send a thank—you note to the
employer within 24 hours after meeting

‘ them —— at least, in an e-mail.
You might even want to send a hand-

written note.

“It might sound like a little bit of over— -

kill,” Kelly said. But ‘so few send hand-
written notes thatthey could stand out.
“In the competitive environment in
which we’re in, you need to be able to stand
out,” Kelly said. “That just might be the

. way you can stand out from the crowd.”

Try not to make mistakes — and
don’t_wear cologne

If you fail to arrive to the interview on
time, it can be a deal-breaker with your
employer. .

Kelly said that people can avoid a worst-
case scenario (such as being stuck in traffic
or getting lost) by arriving early — even
if the time frame seems drastic.

“I might ‘have to be really, really early,
but I’m going to make sure I avoid traffic
issues,” Kelly said. If the interview is at 10

' a.m., you might want to plan to be there

at 9 a.m., he said. .

Other common mistakes include mis-
communication through body language
or dress.

“If you’re saying you’re really excited
about the position-, you need to be smiling
and nodding — sitting forward in your
chair, rather than a laid-back or casual
stance,” Kelly said.

A working man’s jams

The soundtrack to happy career

Kieran Layton
Contributing Editor

Many people like to think they have a so-called
soundtrack to their lives. To have a bubbly pop
song subconsciously blaring while driving with
the windows down or a brooding indie number
underscore your worst moods is a comforting
psychological response, and might alleviate
unnecessary anxiety or enhance a happy mo-
ment.

More speciﬁcally, however, there are a num-
ber of songs that are universally appropriate for
the times in your life that involve your career.
Whether it’s getting your ﬁrst job, losing a‘ job
or even retiring, let this article be a roadmap to
the melodic comforts that you will want stuck
in your head.

ﬁrst impression on your boss and co—workers,
and you are excited to dive head—ﬁrst in a pile
of interesting and fascinating work that surely
awaits you at your new office — or cubicle.
Well, there is no ﬁtting song for states of de-
lusion, but once you ﬁnally realize that the job
isn’t everything you thought it would be, this
little ditty will become your manifesto. Plus, it
is practically a requirement of stuffy oﬂices to
simultaneouslybumtheir radio volume up speciﬁ-
callywhenthis songplays. Alongwithworkplace
gossip, it is a staple at offices around the world.

And just try getting the chorus out of your head _

— I dare you.

For a job interview, the two things that the
applicant needs — besides deodorant and a lack of
noticeable tattoos — are conﬁdence and charisma.

Going in for a job interview: “Because Pm
Awesome,” by The Dollyrots

' For a job interview, the two things that the
applicant needs — besides deodorant and a
lack of noticeable tattoos — are conﬁdence and
charisma. What better way to inst:ill some much
needed self-esteem than to listen to a song that
shouts such a message?

By punk-rock girl group The Dollyrots, the
song could really be sungfora potential employer
inlieu of a résumé, ensuring employment. Actu-
ally, don’t do that. But having lyrics like “I’m a
leader. I’m a winner, and I’m cleaner -— ‘cause
I’m awesome” coursing through your head will
instill nothing but positive things.

“It’s just one of thosedays when you don’t

Put yourselfin the position of the sub —head—
ing,justforasecond, and this iconic Limp Bizkit
classic makes perfect sense. Let it rage in your
head, and give secretary Lois — the woman
who took the last cup of coffee and didn’t make
anymore! — a death stare, and you might feel
a little better.

You get ﬁred: “Hit the Road jack,” Ray

Whatareyou goingto do? You either messed
up your last quarterly report, you accidentally
mass e-mailed a dirty joke or perhaps you got
caught with the boss’ wife. Now you’re out of a
job, but don’tfret—- justpretend it’s like thattime
interval right after you graduated college!
Ifyou’re 21, play some beer pong and relax
for a little bit, or if student loans and other bills
areof a pressing concern, try robbingabank. But
be warned — that requires an entirely separate
song guide. ‘

PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) A

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
cation records: These rights include: ~ ’ I

- The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives

cial will make arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may be in-
spected. lf the records are not maintained by the University ofﬁcial to whom the request was submitted, that ofﬁ-
cial shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.

- The right to request the amendment of the students education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer-
sity official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it
is inaccurate.

if the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University wilt notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notiﬁed of the right to a
hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure 09-08-01.

- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable information contained in the student's

versity has contracted (such as an attomey, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trust-
ees; or a student sewing on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an-
other school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the offi-
cial needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University-will disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or
intends to enroll. The University will forward records on request of another school.

online portfolios newest student tool

Tara Nair
Staff Writer

Some students are bypassingjob search sites like
Monsterzcom and choosing instead to create their
own online portfolios.

Matthew Galmoff, an employment develop-
ment specialist in Pitt’s Office of Student Employ-
ment and Placement Assistance, said creative
industries such as public relations, advertising,
marketing, and graphic design usually ask for
samples of applicants’ work, but he has never
worked with employers who require an online
portfolio.

“It’s more something thatastudent typically
creates on their own that they want to submitas
extra material,” Galmoff said.

Galmoff said he has worked with students
who created portfolios as supplements to their
applications and applied for competitive intern-
ships at top public relations ﬁrms or advertising
agencies.

Depending on the size of the applicant pool,
anelectronic portfolio can distinguish you from
the rest of the crowd, he said.

Galmoff said companies looking for writ-
ing samples — those in the communications,

journalism, fashion or retail —— ﬁnd electronic
portfolios especially useﬁrl. V
“It just depends on how much ofthat creativ-
ity will relate back to the job,” Galmoff said.

For certain ﬁelds, having an online portfolio
can simplify the application process and make
viewing your samples easier.

Pam O’Brien, associate director of public and
professional writing in the University’s English
department, said some applicants put a link to
their work on their resumés, though it is not a
substitute for bringing hard copy samples to
an interview.

“With a hard copy, you’re forced to look at it
and you can make an impression on the front

to make his portfolio when he applied for jobs
and internships last year.

“It’s not the most impressive thing ever, but
somebodywho is 34and doesn’t even knowwhat
Twitter is thinks it’s the greatest thing in the
world,” Snyder said. -

Snyder said it was easy to make a page tha
looked professional with the templates provided
by Google Sites.

cover. With an online source, all you see is ahy-
perlink,” Galmoff said.

O’Brien said that students don’t have to make
their own websites from scratch. They can use
programs such as Google Sites or WordPress to
create an electronic portfolio.

Pitt alumnus Drew Snyder used Google Sites

Snyder suggested.

Snyder graduated ﬁ'om Pitt last year with a
bachelor’s in English writing and a certiﬁcate in
Public and Professional Writing. He is currently
doingan internship at:A. Brown-Olmstead&As-
sociates, a public relations company in Atlanta,

a

Georgia.

O’Brien said a strong web portfolio should
include aresumé, contact information, examples
of projects applicants have done and a gloss — or
explanations of those projects. Students can also
include work they’ve created at an internship or

job, as longas they have permission to share them
publicly. Some people choose to include letters
of recommendation. _ _

Snyder said he “wanted to show that I was
tech savvy and that I was capable of ﬁtting into
the new use of mainstream media devices and
tools.”

Snyder said he put the link to his portfolio at
the end of every cover letter he wrote.“Since the
state of the economy worsened, everyone has had
to widen their job searches,” Snyder said.

Snyderbegan by applying mostly to lawﬁrms,
but after limited success he moved on to public
relationsﬁrms because he thoughthis skills could
easily transfer there.

He said the advantage of a web portfolio de-
pends on the job and the employer.

‘A lot of them wantaWord document. Some
want a .pdf ﬁle. Some appreciate the link. The
biggest variable is who is looking at your stuff,”
Snyder said. ' ,

Older Students balance work, life

-Jayson Myers
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Working on classes, getting good grades,
ﬁnding a job after graduation —— these are
hard enough for students. . <

But balancing a family, another job,
and the social life of a college student, like
many College of General Studies students
do, can be even harder.

While most Pitt students attend college
in an attempt to start their ﬁrst career,
others, like Rosemary Natale, a Media
and Professional Communications major,
return later in life to start a second. ,

“I have two Associates degrees,” Na-
tale said, “but I just kept ﬁnding all these
great job opportunities and they all say
the same thing: You need a bachelor’s
degree. So I decided to come back.”

Natale explained that it is demanding
to return to college a family and a previ-
ous career, and that, having not attended
college since 1980 when she earned her
first associate’s degree, it was difﬁcult to
start studying once again.

“I knew it would be difficult to compete

with the younger students on campus
but necessary if I wanted to advance in a
career,” Natale said in an e-mail. “I have
found it necessary to attend workshops
(critical reading techniques, note—taking
skills, test—taking skills) in assisting me
in becoming a more focused/better stu-
dent.”

Natale combines her course load with .

a teaching assistant, and a representative
in the University senate. _

Because of such an intense workload,
Natale alternates between taking one and
two classes a semester. ‘

“If you get too overwhelmed,” Natale
said, “[the work] just turns into dread.”

Natale encourages people to return to
college to pursue a second career.

Many people in my profession lost most of what
they worked for, if not everything, in the credit

crisis.

“You have as much to share as any of
V the younger students,” Natale said.

Like Natale, Jason Bolton,.a Social Sci-
ences major, returned to school for an
additional degree.‘

“I have to go to grad school,” Bolton
said, explaining that he intends to obtain
a doctorate and enter occupational health
psychology.

Bolton already has a bachelor’s de-
gree in architecture from Baker College in
Michigan. He said he took ajob in archi-
tecture in Pittsburgh, but left when he saw
the next big dip coming in the industry as
a result of the financial crisis.

“Many people in my profession lost
most of what they worked for, if not ev-
erything, in the credit crisis,” Bolton said.
“I was lucky I chose to re-skill when I did.
I loved the design profession, though — I
just saw the next big clip was coming. I
decided to go back to school to prepare
for the new career that would be neces-
sary after.”

A full-time student working part-time
on the side, Bolton sees nothing but posi-
tives in his decision to change careers.

“Like a stock portfolio, it’s good to
have a lot of different experiences,” Bol-
ton said. He explained that architecture
was something he could fallback on, but
because of the recession, psychology

Al. Second languages separate candidates

L.)

Simone Cheatham
Staff Writer

‘ ,Experts say knowing a second language

‘can help students ﬁnd jobs in an unsteady
economy.

Cheryl Finlay, the director of Student
Employment and Placement Assistance,
said knowing a foreign language can bene-
ﬁt students, especially if they want to work
for government agencies, which have hired
more than 1,000 language analysts and
linguists since the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.

“Being ﬂuent in a foreign language can
only increase the opportunities available

_ to you and your chances of obtaining posi-

tions over other candidates who are not
ﬂuent in another language,” Finlay said.

Alan juffs, a linguistics professor at
Pitt, said people who are fluent in French,
Chinese and Arabic dialects might have
a higher chance of getting key jobs in
government offices, especially the FBI
or the CIA.

“Japanese is also a good bet,” Juffs
added. “But every language is obviously
valuable. It just depends on what you want
to do.”

\WHAT’S ON YOUR

juffs said Americans can benefit from
learning Spanish because of the large num-
ber of Hispanic people are immigrating to
the United States. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau’s website, Hispanics made
up roughly 15 percent of the U.S. popula-
tion in 2007 and will make up an estimated

 

long run,” Stutz said. ‘‘It’s definitely not
the only foreign language spoken here,
but I think it’s safe to say that it’s one of
the most practical ones to learn if you’re
staying in the U.S.”

She also hopes to use her Spanish in
Peru, where she’d like to Work with Doc-

It’s important to know the history,
literature and customs of other cultures.

25 percent of its population in 2050.
Pitt senior Haley Stutz majored in
Spanish partially for that reason.
“I wanted to major in Spanish not only
because I love the language but because I
knew it would be extremely valuable in the

managing a geographic territory, face-to—face

“I’ve been to Peru a few times and I fell
in love with it down there,” Stutz said. “I
would love to be able to help down there
as a doctor once I establish myself up
here. That’s one of the reasons I decided

to double major in chemistry and Span-
ish, and hopefully it’ll help me find job
security up here, too.” ‘

Juffs said students could also use for-
eign languages to help them teach English
to others. juffs said knowing a foreign
language and having insight into other
cultures can help if students choose to
teach English abroad or volunteer for or-
ganizations like the Peace Corps.

“It’s important to know the history,
literature and customs of other cultures,”
Juffs said. “As you become more immersed
in a culture’s literature, you can appreciate
what the writers are talking about as well
as improve your own vocabulary in that
country’s language. Then, in turn, you’ll
be able to have more of an understanding
when teaching English to others.”

And if students want to further their
understanding of the structures of lan-
guage rather than the vocabulary only,
juffs suggests studying linguistics, too.

“Graduate schools and employers look
at linguistics very seriously because it
is more of a quantitative kind of train-
ing and deals more with the psychology
behind language,” he said. “Linguistics
and modern languages complement each
other well.”

Rookies at work face pressure, challenges

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Last summer I spent three months work-
ing as a substitute teacher back home in
Virginia. Unlike most school systems, in
my county a sub need only be older than
18 with a high school diploma. I wasn’t
anxious to relive my middle school ex-
perience but I couldn’t pass up the pay.
I donned the closest thing I could ﬁnd
to business—casual attire and entered
the world of authority ﬁgures with great
trepidation.

Even though I worked as a teacher, it
seems this situation "is all too common to
any fresh—faced college student entering
the job market. Veterans who have been
around the ofﬁce longer will be quick to
assume the new hire’s inexperience and
assume she’s incompetent at the job. Don’t
lose conﬁdence. Sometimes naivete and
youth can make the newbie a better can-
didate than the jaded old—timers.

I spent most of junior high carrying

around a pair of glasses, “The Hobbit,”
and an inhaler. I returned to middle school
feeling just as out of place as I did when
I was the only sixth—grader picking Tolk-
ien over N*Sync. Most of my co—workers
were women in their forties or ﬁfties. In

The students could tell I was the young
pup on the block as much as the teachers
could. When my co—workers didn’t take
me seriously, the kids didn’t mind. I might
have been a dork in middle school, but as a
college student I was “cool.” They compli-

My relationship with the students might
have been unorthodox, but it worked. I was

good at my job.

— “Their key lime pie is just fabulous!”
— their home improvement projects and
their children’s cross country meets. As the

might have been unorthodox, but it
worked. I was good at my job. I worked
as a special education teaching assistant,
helping autistic, emotionally disturbed‘
and learning disabled students. I tried”
to be gentle and have a sense of humor.

I made sure that everyone stayed on task
without being too tough.

I wasn’t particularly good at helping
out with math or science homework, but
let’s be real —— middle school is more about
ﬁnding your way through crippling social
awkwardness than it is about memoriz-
ing the periodic table. The students I was
working with were particularly vulnerable
because they dealt with learning disabili-
ties and behavioral problems. Some came‘,
from broken homes and combated eating
disorders. To secure their fragile happi-
ness I took on the role of cheerleader,
guidance counselor and older sister. If
they got smacked in the face with a ball
in P.E., I tried to make sure none of the
other kids saw them cry.

Some of my co—workers didn’t like the
fact that I was so close to the kids. There

“were other teachers on staff who could
have taken the job out of the hands of a
substitute. I was allowed to stay because I
proved competent and the students actu-
ally learned when I taught — and those
above me noticed. With time the other
teachers began to take me more seriously,
even including me more in conversation at
the lunch table. The workroom encounters
were easier to manage. Most of the teach-
ers taught or knew the same students, and
they became the common denominator of

1 our conversations.

'  I was good at my job for the very reason
the veteran teachers assumed I wouldn’t
be — I’m young. I’m young enough to re-
member my middle school days, young
enough to remember what it was like to
be the only kid who didn’t shop at Limited

' Too. I threw myself into my work and the
good stuff came: satisfaction and a steady
paycheck until school let out in June. I
occasionally still check in on some of my
former students.

Whatever career field you might be

 

heading into, don’t feel undermined be-
cause you are fresh out of college. We
might be inexperienced, but we are often
the ones with new ideas and perspectives.
And no matter what your j ob is, work hard
at it. _

It took my employers a little while to
notice that I was a competent hire. Rec-
ognition oiften'doesn’t come until things
aren’t running smoothly —- in my case,
when other teachers couldn’t make my
students do their work or calm them down
after an emotional meltdown.

Each job is suited to a unique combina-
tion of personality and skill. If you love
what you’re doing, chances are you’ll be
pretty good at it. Don’t worry if your co-
workers and higher-ups don’t recognize
your talents immediately. Instant gratiﬁ-
cation doesn’t happen in the workplace.
It will take time to prove yourself, but re-

spect and satisfaction is worth the wait.

Young people strive
for stability  

Despite low incomes, economy offers lessons to youngens

Richard Burnett
MCT Campus

The ﬁnancial meltdown was a wake—up call
for the young. -

Tough economic times offer young
adults a great opportunity to embrace the
ﬁnancial basics of saving, spending and‘
investing. ~

Folks in their late teens and 20s were
living a carefree, good life until the down-
turn took hold. Now they see parents or
neighbors hurting. Homes, jobs and college
education might be in jeopardy. And the till
is getting thin. 4 -

“Honestly, a lot of people are scared _or

’It’s good advice for anyone, but it’s
especially critical for the young to learn
smart—money principles early so they can
establish a foundation for the future, said
Rosannajacobsen, an Orlando banker and
chairman of the Florida ]ump$tart Coali-
tion, a nonproﬁt that sponsors ﬁnancial
education in schools. '

“The earlieryou start, the better,” she

said. “You have to understand early on how 0

ﬁnancial things work and what the impact
could be of what you do with your money.
Be informed, be ready and be prepared.”
Jacobsen said she tried to instill money
skills in her now-grown children, and it has

helped themweather the current storm. ,0

Folks in their late teens and 205 were living
a carefree, good life until the downturn

took hold.

worried about what could happen,” said
Cody Swain, a student and business in-
tern at the University of Central Florida.
“My generation has never had to deal with
something of this nature. We’ve sort of had
everything given to us.” V

Those days are gone, the experts say,
offering these tips to young adults:

-Set up abudget and stick to it. Track your
spending and live within your means.

-Make yourself save by setting aside
money from every paycheck. ,

-Save for emergencies such as a major
illness and squirrel away separate cash for
“wants,” such as a vacation.

—Start building a retirement nest egg
and put the money where you can’t easily
get to it. _

—Limit credit card spending and pay off
balances at the end of each month to avoid
ﬁnance charges. '

—Check your credit score and boost it by
paying bills on time. —

card debt and save wisely.

Her daughter, for example, got her mas-
ter’s degree in business administration
more than a year ago but hasn’t yet found

‘ a full—time job. Savings that she began to

amass as a child have helped tide her over
during the search. ' » -
And if you start early, the payoffs can
be huge. I
_ People who start saving even modestly
— about $50 to $100 a month —- as young
adults can potentially build an account of
$365,000 to nearly $800,000 by retire-
ment age, based on an ‘average 8 percent
annual growth rate, said Denise Kovach, a
ﬁnancial planner with Certiﬁed Financial
Group in Altamonte Springs, Fla.
But if you wait until age 40, the savings

‘would be less than $125,000.

“That’s a huge0difference,” she said.
“Clearly, the younger you are, the more
you can save by the time you retire. Time
is on your side.”

Nepotism has some advantages

Molly Green
Columnist

Nepotism is a great excuse to use when you
don’t get your way in the working world.
Lately, I would say it’s second only to “that
damn recession.”

Didn’t get that job you applied for?

I Nepotism.

Didn’t win the Pennsylvania Lottery
this week? I bet that winner was the son
of someone. V

When you cry nepotism, no one ques-
tions whether the real reason for your
failure was a poor resume, a bad interview’
or statistical probability. V

‘This is because —— unlike stupidity and
laziness —— nepotism is universally reviled
in the United States.

Ideologically, nepotism is not the
American way. We made that pretty clear
when we told King George III and the rest
of his primogeniture—ruled country just

' whatthey could do with their overpriced I

tea.

But in practice, it is everywhere, es-
pecially in politics and Hollywood. Cah-
didates bemoan the fact that opponents
from the Kennedy, Clinton or Bush‘dynas-
ties win elections only becauseof their
name. ' ’

Likewise, Hollywood nepotism has
brought us such musical delights as Ali
Lohan, Miley Cyrus and —+ my person-
al favorite — Solange Knowles. People
Magazine pretty much exists to post
photographs of celebrity couples’ babies.
Shiloh Jolie-Pitt could make moe money
by spitting up on a napkin-and selling it
on eBay than I could make in a year of
hard labor.

Despite the ostensible injustice of it
all, it turns out nepotism might actually
be a good thing.

Apparently, being a beneficiary of
nepotism improves job performance. Ac-
cording to Society for Industrial 8: Orga~

nizational Psychology, Inc., “Because of a

shared values set within the occupation,
the family members reinforce and support

one another’s, involvement in professional ~

development. Their level of commitment
to these values may therefore be higher
than the average.” I

‘ A column by ‘Klaus Kneale in Forbes
Magazine adds that there is also some-
thing to be said for geneticltalent.

It is true that for every Logan or Cyrus,
there is a legitimately deserving child of
nepotism. Gwyneth Paltrow —— despite
my disdain for her and her pretentious,
self-indulgent website GOOP —_is a truly
talented actress, for example.

Not to mention, without nepotism,

we might have been deprived of Solange
and her creative use of fur-and—feather
garments.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that
nepotism leaves its greatest negative

impact on its recipients. I, for instance,

was once employed by my’ sister, and I
have never ‘worked harder for another

employer.

She knew my weaknesses. She knew
when I was slacking off. She knew every-
thing. She was Darth Vader, and I'was Luke
Skywalker getting my hand light saber—ed
off.

And she had this uncanny ability to
make me feel as though I was never reach-

ing my full work potential.
“Do you have your work done?” She’d
ask, not with the casual inquisitiveness

The Giles Files

Unpaid internships detriment to the labor market.

Giles Howard
Columnist

Internships are a popular way for students

-to learn valuable work—related skills while

getting acquainted with a corporation of
their choice. While many interns are paid
for their work, or at least granted a sti-
pend, theunpaid internship is a ﬁxture
of college life.

Students in the social sciences ﬂock
to unpaid internships, working at non-
proﬁts, political ofﬁces and news publica-
tions because they perceive the experience
of working for these outﬁts as vital not
only to their college experience but also
to their future career. .

But in this process of working for ex-
perience rather than money, students
are harming themselves and the labor
market.

First, by working for free, students
are telling employers that their labor is
not valuable. Remember, internships vary
from ﬁve to 40 hours per week, and many
approach full-time employment.

A Working these kinds of hours without
any compensation except for “experience”
signals that students don’t take their skills
and time seriously in the context of a capi-
talist free market. Keep in mind, we func-
tion in an economy where hiring and pay
are largely determined by skill.

Certainly, nepotism and other prefer-
ential hiring actions skew this metric, but
in the majority of situations, it is an ap-
plicant’s ability that secures him a paying
job. And the fact that it pays is important
because exchanging your skills and time
for nothing but a letter of recommenda-
tion is a reﬂection on how you view your-
self in the job market. '

Remember, if companies weren’t able
to dupe a student in photocopying, an-

swering phones and writing internal‘

memos for free, they would need to hire
a paid secretary. In any other economic
system, this demand would give the ap-

plicant leverage to secure compensation ,

for their time.

But this isnft only about the individual
college student and the fact that he’s get-
ting ripped off by corporations. No, col-
lege students accepting and even,clamor-
ing for unpaid internships affect everyone
by devaluing and making it impossible for
students in some areas to trade their skills
and time for compensation.

For instance, a political science ma-
jor would be hard-pressed to ﬁnd a paid
internship in a political ofﬁce, and it is
almost impossible to find one on Capitol

Hill. Instead, there’s intense competition

for unpaid internships in politics, which

 

makes it extremely difﬁcult for a student
to ﬁnd a paid position. i

A Unpaid internships may teach students
the ins and outs of the political system,
but they make obtaining a political educa-
tion almost impossible for students who
have to pay their own way through col-
lege. Without income from the internship,

students have to take on second jobs, rely
on family or go further into debt in order
to gain a ﬁrsthand political education in
the nation’s capital.

This trend is repeated in many disci-
plines as students who have to pay their
own way are priced out of internships.
This turns a job market based on merit

31

and ability into one based on wealth and
connections. _

Of course, in some instances, unpaid
internships might be necessary for a par-
ticular ﬁeld of study, such as law, but as an
overall trend in education, unpaid intern-
ships should be discouraged.

The difﬁculty is that many colleges

AHoward > 32

S Making money more valuable

than not making money

Howard 4 31

and universities have incorporated unpaid
internships as part of their curriculum,
encouraging students to basically per-
form volunteer work for credit. Although a
student’s labor can teach him many things

' through work experience, employment

should be considered primarily as an eco-
nomic question and only secondarily as an
aspect of education.

Treating work as an economic rather
than educational issue will prepare stu-
dents for the reality of their time after
college, when securing a job is based on

your skills rather than your willingness
to work for free.

On the whole, unpaid internships dis-
tort the job market, price many students
out of positions in competitive fields, such
as politics, and reinforce an unrealistic
understanding of post—college work. Uni-
versities should encourage students to
secure the greatest monetary gain possible
‘for the skills they possess, rather than sup-
port the exchange of hundreds of hours of
labor for little or no material gain.

Survey 4 32

Retirement savings are of particular concern_

foryoungerAmericans because undercurrentac-
yiarial assumptions the Social Securitytrustﬁmd
willbe exhausted in2039, the yeartheﬁrst of Gen
Y will turn 62, and beneﬁts could be threatened
unless changes are made.

Social Security Administration officials and
ﬁnancial planners continue to emphasize the
importance of individual savings, retirement
plans — 401(k) accounts and individual retire-
ment accounts — and Social Security beneﬁts
forpost-work income, what the SSAcallsa“three
legged stool.”

Both advise not relying solely on Social Secu-
rity for retirement income.

George Barnes, aninvest:mentadviseratPru-

l dential Financial Planning Services in Newark,

N.J., applied the slogan ﬁom discount clothier,
Syms: “An educated consumer is our best cus-
tomer when it comes to investing.”

The key things to learn: save, even if you can
only save small amounts, and make wise invest-
ments. '

“Time is money’s best friend, so starting to
save or invest early canyield tremendous results,
even if it’s small amounts, as over time they add
up,” Gail Cunningham, public relations vice presi-
dent at the NFCC, said. “When you’re young and
just starting out, you have so many needs and
wants that ﬁnding that extra money is particu-
larly hard, especially ‘since retirement seems so
faroff.” ~

Fresh—ﬁom—college adults widely use regular
savings accounts, money market accounts and
certiﬁcates of deposit at commercial banks — all
ways of savingbutwith loweryieldsthaninvesting
inbonds or the riskier stock market. Those work-
ingfor employers who provide401(k) retirement
plans can learn much from the plan materials,
Barnes said.

When trying to save money for reserves or ,

emergencyfunds, “there’s nothing like the bank,”
Barnes said.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insures
savings accounts and CD5, up to $250,000 in
most cases, and there is more liquiditywiththose
vehicles. Savings accounts are more liquid than
bonds or stocks, meaning an investor can sell
quickly in an emergency and get all of his or her
money back.

Barnes suggests that the out—of—college job-
less interested in saving for retirement explore
IRAs, retirement accounts for individuals that
can invest in securities like common stock or
mutual funds.

Less riskyIRAs have stated interest rates and
are sirnilarto long—term CDs while higl1—riskIRAs
investyour moneyinmarketsecurities like mutual
funds. IfanIRAaccountholderwithdraws money
early, thewithdrawal could be subjectto taxes and
penalties. Abigbeneﬁt, though, is thetaxsavings.
ING Direct, Fidelity, The Vanguard Group and T.
Rowe Price all offer IRA accounts.

According to Barnes, who has 17- and 18-year-
old children, a generation used to quick access
lacks patience and education on the volatility of

the investment markets. “Education is really the
key to success,” he said.

“There’s amindsetthatis possibly generation-
wide that is ‘instant gratiﬁcation,” Barnes said.
“You Twitter just so you can ﬁnd what someone
is doing today...”

“As a result, when you don’t see a result irn—
mediately, or you don’t see value immediately,
you question the source,” he said.

Along with education and the need for disci-

pline, or the ability to stay on a budget and bal-
ance a checkbook, Barnes says there is an issue
with trust among younger adults; if there’s a risk

attached, young adults are deterred from buy- »

ing 1r1.

“Authority is questioned more often now,”
he said. “That kind of mentality carries over in
your investments. What is missing thatwas very
prevalent for that older generation is trust.”

“It always helps to see the prize awaiting you

at the ﬁnish line,” Cunningham said. So, young
adults should consider the following: Assuming
a 25 percent taxbracket, invest just $40 perweek
for the next 50 years until retirement. An armual
retum on 8 percent will build into a nest egg of
$1,000,000 after taxes.

Where are you going to ﬁnd that extra $40?

“There are only three answers,” she said. “In—
crease your income, decrease your expenses or
both. If it’s worth it to you, you’ll ﬁnd away.”

Crew brings hip—hop, St. Croix to Pitt

“J. Bones”, l‘Blackie Chan, ” Reiki Bell and Jason Brown produce “Time and Space. ”

Sierralstarks
Senior Staff Writer

It’s not every day that a rap group
is named after men mounted on
horseback, ﬁghting wars and
defending territory. Cav Crew,
coined from the term cavalry,
hails from the Virgin Island of

St. Croix and hopes to let the‘

originality of its music speak for
itself with the release of it's debut
album later this month.

CavlCrew.wasn’t always a four-
man rap group. Pitt sophomore
Joseph “J. Bones” Arthur remem-
bers when Cav Crew was just a
name given to him and a dozen or
so of his classmates in the Virgin
Islands. l '

“In high school, each of us had
a car instead of a horse,” Arthur
said. Years later, four members

of that same group found them-
selves scattered throughout the
United States, connected not only
by friendship, but music as well.

Arthur and fellow members
Fitz'“Blackie Chan” Decambre,
Reiki Bell and Jason Brown have
fused their culture and their love

for music together in the self-pro— '

duced Time and Space.

Both time and space are a rep-
resentation of Cav Crew’s journey
over the past few years. The four

of them have developed their tal— ~
ent together despite being _sepa— a
rated.

“When we went home [to the
Virgin Islands] this past winter
break, it was strictly recording,”

Arthur said. He explained that in _

the beginning, Cav Crew as a rap
group was just a hobby. However,
as songs began to leak through

the island of St. Croix, he and his
fellow members were encouraged
to consider the idea of taking Cav

‘Crew to the next level. _
Two mixtapes and an abun-

dance of positive feedback later,
Arthur is grateful to the Virgin
Islands. “The reason [Cav Crew]
has even gotten to any serious
point is because of the feedback

‘ we got from home,” he said.

The positive feedback contin-
ued as Cav Crew introduced its
music to listeners in the contigu-
ous United States. From Pitt stu-
dents to those studying at Boston
University, where fellow member
Jason Brown attends, people were
listening. And they liked what
they heard. I

Brown, who calls himself
“Champ Brown,” explained the

reason people are so satisﬁed

do with the group’s culture. “Be—

Zemeckis aBlue Meanie for ‘Submarine’ fans

Andy Tybout
‘ Columnist

Paul McCartney can relax —— if
any band can remain a corner-
stone of popular culture ﬁfty

years after its formation, it’s The V

Beatles. .

Whether it’s a testament to .

good taste or simple nostalgia,

The Beatles’ legacy has latched’

‘itself onto modern pop culture -—

' most recently in 2007’s “Across

the Universe” and last year’s video
game, “The Beatles: Rock Band.”
But with the news that Robert
Zemeckis (“Forrest Gump,” “Cori-

tact”) will direct a remake of “Yel- . 

low Submarine,” contemporary
Beatlemania threatens to cave in

on itself. The question is, will the 1’

music follow suit? I
Now, instead of going on a
long tangent about my love of The
Beatles, and reminiscing about
the ﬁrst time I slid The White Al-
bum into my computer, I’ll keep
this short and to the point: I re-
ally like The Beatles. So in theory,

I should be elated thafanother
Beatlesmovie is coming out. But

« instead, I, like many fans, am con-

ﬂicted — caught-in that age—old
predicament of wanting to pre-
serve the band’s legacy without

tarnishing it. _Which iswhat I’m.

afraid Zemeckis might do.
“Yellow Submarine,” a remake
of the trippy 1968 animated ﬁlm
that can easily double as an acid
trip, is slated for release in 2012
by Walt Disney Pictures. The
story, if I followed it at all, goes
something like this: There’s this
magical place called Pepperland,
where everyone lives in a druggie
paradise, until a gang of downers
called the[Blue Meanies attacks.
The escaped captain of a yellow
submarine must enlist the help

of the Fab Four to bring music ,

and happiness back to the land.

_Or something along those lines ,

— you can watch the movie in.
. its entirety on YouTube.

The original has an aesthetic.

very similar’ to Monty Python
animations, but you can bet that

will be lostin the glossy technol- '

Vogy Zemeckis often employs. In

particular, the new, millennial
“Yellow Submarine” will feature

a the same performance-capture

technology as some of the di-
rector’s other projects, like “A
Christmas Carol” or “The Polar
Express.” »

Now this is all well and good

the music, the 1968 ﬁlm’s biggest
strength was its campy anima-
tion — a jarring blend of cartoon
and random images pasted onto

Pepperland’s delirious landscape. *

Without the loveably odd design,
there might be little to enjoy in

J Zemeckis’s new edition.

‘Less than three years ago, in

ac  

’ So what will become of The Beatles if
the movie turns out to be candy-colored
' garbage? Will their legacy be -cheapened?

from a technological standpoint,
but think about it for a moment:
a bunch of creepy, computer-ani-
mated Beatles look-alikes pranc-
ing about on screen, in the midst
of a nonsensical story. Aside from

fact, Zemeckis took a treasured
classic — “Beowulf” — and
juiced it up with a horde of spe-
cial effects, resulting in a con-
voluted, video-game—like mess.
True, this is the same man that

 

directed “Forrest Gump,” but I
trust him considerably less after
his recent string of movies.

So what will become of The

‘Beatles if the movie turns out to

be candy-colored garbage? Will
their legacy be cheapened?.Will“'
their music be suffocated by a
wave of commercial miasma?

Fortunately, I don’t think so.
In the absence of new music, The
Beatles are a commodity — some-
thing to be inﬁnitely repackaged 3;,
and sold to a nostalgic audience
(many of whom weren’t even alive
during the band’s advent). But
that doesn’t mean it’ll be hard
to separate the band’s music and
its commercial offspring. Any fan
with half a brain can distinguish “F”
The White Album from Kidz Bop
Sings The Beatles. ‘

Make no mistake: This new
“Yellow Submarine” is a money
grab. That doesn’t mean, howev-
er, that when the glossed—up new "13
edition hits the screens I’m going J
to stop listening to “Strawberry
Fields Forever.” Instead, I’m just

“Up in the Air”

Starring: George Clooney, Vera
Farmiga, Anna Kendrick

Dir: Jason Reitman

Paramount Pictures

Grade: A

It is the rare ﬁlm that can suc-
cinctly capture the entire anxiety
of a nation in economic turmoil in
less than two hours, while simulta-
neously providing audiences with

_.(.,one of the best displays of acting

and directing to be seen in theaters
this year. .

Fortunately, “Up in the Air” is
exactly that kind of ﬁlm.

With Oscar buzz surrounding
this gem of a ﬁlm since its premiere
at the Telluride Film Festival in
September, Reitman’s directorial
follow—up to critical darling “Juno”
will surely garner a similar number
of Oscarnominations. And thank-
fully, it will deserve each and every

K37” One.

George Clooney plays Ryan
Bingham, a smarmy and solitary
“corporate downsizing expert,”
which essentially means busi-
nesses bring him in to do their
dirty work, and for anyone who
has taken a peek at unemployment
rate statistics recently, it’s obvi-
ous that business is booming for
Bingham.

A major part of his job is the
near—constant traveling — almost

exclusively by plane — hence the c

ﬁrst interpretation of the ﬁlm’s
title. Bingham loves being up in the
air, or at least anywhere but home,
as the noncommittal lifestyle al-
lows him to dodge the emotional
pitfalls the majority of us deal with
on a regular basis. ’

Bingham’s independent exis-
tence hits a snag, however, when
his company hires fresh—out—of—
Cornell Natalie Keener (Anna Ken-
drick, “Camp”) to revamp the way
downsizings are done —— namely,
she wants to take the travel aspect
out of the equation, doing every-
thing over the internet.

Bingham is obviously not
happy with the prospect of being
grounded, and he and Keener hit
the road for one last series of in-
person confrontations. Over the
course of their trip, the two polar
opposites teach each other about
the lives they _aren’t leading. Add
into the equation Bingham’s on-
the-road lover (Vera Farmiga), arid
the quaint little character drama
ultimately takes a deeply rooted
place in your heart. '

Simply reading a description of
the ﬁlm’s plot does not do it justice.
“Up in the Air” is more about the
subtle idiosyncrasies each char-

acter has, the strikingly authentic ,

dialogue and the genuine emotion
that Reitman rouses within the au-

' dience. Of course, a ﬁlm dealing

with people losing their jobs might
strike a very personal note in this
tough economic climate, but the
subject is handled with such pre-

cision and honesty that the ﬁlm .

morphs into a microcosm of the
times.

Clooney is well—suited for the _

role, even if it sometimes feels like

he is playing the role of himself -

as opposed to’ Ryan Bingham, and
Farmiga nails a role that requires

her to be charming even at one
of the ﬁlm’s big twists‘. It is Ken-

drick, however, who deserves the “H
most praise: Taking a role that any ‘

to be something that people won’t
expect, so I’m ready to see how
they react to it,” he said.
Pushing the boundaries of its
genre, Cav Crew drew inspiration

“*1 from anything and everything for

this album. “Everyone I come into
contact with is from-a different
walk of life and listens to all differ-
ent types of music,” Arthur said of
fellow Pitt students. “I spent time

W with each of them and listened

to their music and took different
elements from each [genre],” he
said. Arthur then tried to incor-
porate what he heard into his

homemade hip—hop beats.
Arthur has been making beats
since the age of 10 and has been
inﬂuenced by music all his life.
He declared the one thing that he
noticed was that music, no matter
the type, sends a message. When
he and his fellow members be-
came serious about releasing an_
album, they didn’t want to inﬂu-
ence others with negativity.
“Cav Crew is trying to send a
positive message,” he insisted.
“With the things we speak about
in our songs, We’re trying to in-
corporate regular life, which is
something anybody can relate

to.
For Brown, life is about “hav-
ing fun and enjoying the mo-
ment.”
Arthur agrees. “The main

thing I always try to do is have
fun. If I’m not having fun, then I
won’t do my best,” Arthur said.
Cav Crew, though, is serious
about its craft and is working to-

Don’t Worry, football season will return 

Drew Brees has the fans of New Orleans happy, but Super Bowl week

MC Campus

can be tough for fans of the 28 eliminated teams.

Greg Treitley
Staff Writer

 

Saints and Colts fans, if you could
leave the room for a moment?
Thanks.

Hey there, football fan. I know,
I know. You miss them already. It’ll
be tough going eight months without
watching your team play.

Yes, this year was rough, but at
least your team is still in the news.
They’re making moves and showing
you that next year will be different,
maybe even 8-8. .

Maybe you’ve already hired a7 -
year old ﬁrst-time general manager,
or maybe you reunited Mike Shana-
‘han with ‘star running back Clinton
Portis. Shanahan traded him away
once already in Denver. He won’t do
it again, right?

You even got to go through your
usual game ritual for the Pro Bowl
yesterday. You went to the conve-
nience store to buy some chips, but
the place was all out because every-
body else beat you to it. What a good
idea moving the game to the week
before the Super Bowl was. It really
built up the hype. ‘

You sat anxiously as you watched
for every time Joe Thomas made a
pancake block, and you pointed out
to your friends how dynamic Cleve-
land’s offense will be next year if they
movejosh Cribbs to wide receiver.

When the Super Bowl comeson
next weekend, you’ll probably pick
a side. Maybe you’ll take the Saints

because a backup lineman went to
your high school — well, not your
high school, but a high school with
a similar name. In the end, it won’t
matter, since you have 5 and 2 in your
Super Bowl pool.

You’ll quickly re-examine your
tearn’s schedule and argue that, had
they not lost that game to Cleve-
land and Oakland and Kansas City
(sorry, Steelers fans, this is your
paragraph), they would have made
the playoffs. And then, boom, with
a bounce here and a horrendously

' banged-up opponent there, you’re

in the Super Bowl.

The commercials will be en-
tertaining, won’t they? Budweiser
usually puts out some good ones,
although the comedy-void car ads
can be a bummer. I think they’re
trying to be ironic with them or
something.

Maybe NFL.comwill run another
commercial for its fantasy football
game. You know, like the one with
all the losingteams crying over their
disappointingfantasy seasons. You’ll
laugh, but inside you’ll shed a tear.
It wasn’t your fault you listened to
the wrong experts and thought that
LarryJohnson wouldcarryyourfan—
tasy team to victory and take the real
Chiefs to the playoffs as well.

At some point during the night,
it will hit you. When the game ends,
there will be no more football until
August — September if you don’t
count preseason. I know I don’t. At
least we’ll have arena football. It’s
back, new and improved! Bankrupt-
cy cleared out all the gimmicks. V

There might be some United
Football League play, too, but I can
never ﬁnd it on television. My TV
doesn’t even go up to Versus.

There’s baseball, but you’re a
football fan. You’re not a thinker
— maybe the American League is
alright, but I still don’t know how
the double switch works.

Hopefully your team will sign
that big name free agent. Terrell
Owens is out there for the taking.
Also, you can always trade for Bran-
don Marshall and build up an offense

that will really hide the holes in your

secondary.

The draft is ﬁm, too, because . 1.

it prevents me from having to ex-
ercise outside. I can only take so
much Mel Kiper, though. Regard-
less, there are so many stellar college
quarterbacks that can be your next
underachieving starter. Tim Tebow,
Jimmy Clausen and Sam Bradford all
could be the one chosen to devastate
your team.

Then again, there really isn’t a
football off-season. There are op-
tional team workouts, minicamps,

rookie orientations, Madden ’1o and » “

Brett Favre to occupy your time. I
hear that ancillary late round pick
has really been tearing it up against
fellow ancillary late round picks.

Don’t worry, fellow football fan.
The summer’s going to be tough,
but we can get through it. Stock-
pile as many bags of chips you can,
read up on that ancillary late round
draft pick and do some warm—up
stretches. They’ll be back before
you know it.

Seas0n’s secondtechnical foul comes atbad time

South Florida 4 40

A game and tied the game only twice

— early in the ﬁrst half. They closed

the gap to four at two separate times -

with roughly ﬁve minutes left in the
game, but couldn’t complete the
comeback. .

Trailing 54-49,with 5:33 left to
play, Brown converted one of his
two free throw attempts but Jones
responded with a rebound and two-
point layup at the other end.

Ashton Gibbs hit both of his free
throws 45 seconds later to cut the
Bulls’ lead back to four at 56-52.

It was the closest Pitt got to con-
trolling the momentum in the game.

Dixon said the inability to keep the
tempo contributed to the loss.

“You look at the numbers and
we’ve been a low foul team and we
get to the free throw line much more
than our opponentsj’ he said. “To—
day that was not the case and that’s
why we lost. We have a track record
of that and it’s what we do and we
didn’t do it today.”

Pitt was also assessed its second
technical foul of the season when
Dixonwas called for one 4:17 into the
second half. It was Dixon’s ﬁrst of the
season — Gary McGhee was given a
technical in Pitt’s win over DePaul in

December.

The call came with Pitt trailing
38-32 and in South Florida’s end.
Jones converted both ﬁ'ee throws
and extended the Bulls’ lead to eight.

?‘I said ‘call that’ and that was
what I got a technical foul on. It was
clear as day,” Dixon said. “But again,
great respect for the oflicials. They
do a great job, but in no way did I say
anything that would have been in-
sulting, or unprofessional.”

Despite the loss, Pitt shot better
than South Florida from the ﬁeld.
The Panthers made 46.9 percent of

their ﬁeld goal attempts, their best

effort since shooting 50 percent in
their 82-77 overtime win over Louis-
ville onJan. 16. The Bulls were held to
under 40 percent ﬁom the ﬁeld.

But the Bulls succeeded in their
ability" to capitalize on Panther er-
rors. South Florida was 24—of-35
(68.6 percent) from the free throw
line, including 11—of—14 in the ﬁnal
two minutes of the game.

“I don’t know what it was,” Dixon
said. “We had seven fouls in ﬁve min-
utes and you know we can’t foul. It’s
one of our strengths.” ”

As for the Panthers, they were 12-
for—22 from the foul line and missed

crucial free throws down the stretch.

The Panthers will look for their
seventh Big East win of the season
when they travel to Morgantown on
Wednesday for a matchup against

the No. 9 Mountaineers (17-3, 6-2). 5

The game is set for a 7 p.m. tipoff.

Notes: Senior guard Jermaine
Dixon (right ankle) did not start or
play in the game. Jamie Dixon said
“he was never set to play” against
South Florida. Travon Woodall start-
ed in his place  McGhee was two
points shy of a double-double after

Gilbert Brown had a career day, but-

his performance wasn’t enough as
the Panthers dropped their third Big
East game with a 70-61 loss to South
Florida yesterday. The junior scored
a career-high 25 points —— 14 in the
ﬁrst half — in 35 minutes off the
bench in the loss for Pitt (16—5, 6-3
Big East).

‘>‘He had some good drives and he
made some shots and played well. We
need to get all—around performances
from a lot of our guys,” head coach
Jamie Dixon said. “He did some good
things and he’s got some things he
can work on, too, but he shot it well
which is the biggest thing.”

Brown, who saw the most action
this season since returning from an
academic suspension in late Decem-

fsouth Florida turns up the heat on Pitt

ber, shot 9 for 13 from the ﬁeld and

made 2 of his 3 attempts from behind
the arc.
South J Florida’s Dominique

Jones, a junior guard, overshadowed
Browns effort with 37 points in the
Bulls’ win,. The game was Jones’
second strongest of the season after
leading his team to a 109-105 win
over Providence with 46 points on
Jan. 23.

Jones scored 14 of his points from
free throws and was one of the rea-
sons Pitt struggled controlling ball.

“The main thingwe said was that
we didn’t want to foul him, but then
he had 17 free throw attempts. That’s
what got him going,” Dixon said of
Jones, who also came down with
eight ' rebounds. “(We) felt pretty
good about some of the shots he had
taken and the situation we put him
in. He got free throws and then he
felt better about himself. That’s what

you have to do. We didn’t do what we
had set out to do, which was keep
him off the line.”

Pitt has now lost three of their
last four games —- even trailing at
halftime in their win over St. John’s
on Thursday —— after putting up an
eight-game win streak, including a
5-0 start to conference play. A little
more than a week ago, the Panthers
were ranked in the top-10 nation-
ally and in the running for a Big East
regular season title.

“We need to play better. We shoot
47 percent we turned over 10 times
but yet I didn’t think our offense was
as good as it needed to be,” Dixon
said about his team, which is 1-3
since starting the season 15-2. “Then
defensively, we just didn’t get it done
and obviously Jones hurt us and the
free throws hurt us. Numbers don’t
lie.” .

Panthers eye NCAA Tournament appearance

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ" Writer

In March, the Petersen Events Center
willbe the site ofthe madness thatsur—
rounds the women’s basketball NCAA
err‘--a Tournament.
The Panthers hope they can take
, partinthe eventas morethanhosting
spectators. 3
After a 98-56 loss to the No. 1
Connecticut Huskies (21-0, 8-0), the
Panthers fell to 12-8 overall, with a 1-6
record ir1 Big East conference play.
With nine games left to play, the
Panthers mustﬁnd away to overcome
their mid-season slump iftheyhopeto
secure a spot in the Big Dance.
Head coach Agnus Berenato, who
 considers herself “an optimistic per-
son,” maintains thatherPanthers have
a legitimate chance to make the 64-
team tournament and play in front of
a home crowd.
“I totallybelieve that Pittwillbe se-
lected [to the Tournament] andl never
' once thought differently,” she said.
When the University received
the vote to host the ﬁrst and second
rounds of the tournament, Berenato

sawanopportunityto strengthen Pitt’s
women’s basketball program, but a
large part of that progress hinged on
the Panthers playing in March.

“This is so importantforusto have
the Tournament at home -— that our
University made a bid to be a host,”
Berenato said. “We have talked about
it as atearn and the players know how
important it is for the program.”

The Panthers have made three
consecutive appearances in the NCAA
Tournament, including back-to-back
Sweet 16 performances in 2008 and
2009.

With only one senior on the team,
the Panther’s rosterisﬁlled with play-
ers thatarefamiliarwith onlywinning
and post-season competition.

However, Berenato does not want
her team to face “the daunting task”
of ﬁnishing the season with nine vic-
tories. .

“We do not have to go undefeated
to make the Tournament,” Berenato
said. “Inthis conference, thatwould be
a reason to not even go to practice.”

The strength ofthe Big East confer-
ence may be an advantage to Pitt in
their run for a Tournament selection.

“Inthe BigEast, ifyouwinabout18

or 19 games, thenyou’re in,” Berenato
said. “We have 12, sowejustneed afew
more. Eight or nine teams will make
the Tournament ﬁ'om the conference
this year.”

Inthe upcomingweek, the Panthers
willface Notre Dame and Syracuse, two
Big East opponents that reside in the
top halfof the conference standings.

In order to prepare for this criti-
cal point in the season, the Panthers
look to continue the elevated levels of
conﬁdence and_apply lessons learned
in the loss to Connecticut.

“Everyone was aggressive and we
came out playing har ,” redshirt ju-
nior guardjania Sims said. “People are
starting to step out of their comfort
zones and take shots that they may not
have taken earlier in the season.”

Sims and Berenato appeartobe on

. the same level of opt:imism as well.

“I will walk into the locker room
and shout ‘I’m dancing!’,” Berenato
said. “When I do, Jania always yells
