SU Refurbishment Planned

by JOHN CAPITMAN

The planned refurbishment of
the Student Union will double or
triple the amount of usable lounge
space, according to David Bluey,
Student Government Board mem-
ber and chairman of the Task
Force studying alternatives to the
present facilities.

Bluey feels that the present Stu-
dent Union is inadequate because
it does not provide a “home away
from home” for commuters who
make up more than 50 percent of
Pitt’s students. '

According to Bluey, the major
problem is that “there is no stu-
dent inter-action in the present
building, neither providing ade-
quate space for student activities-
and pastimes, nor a center for ed-_
ucation through association with

 other students.”

Funds have been allocated di--

rectly. from the University, not
from the student activities bud-
get, to remodel the Schenley Cafe-
teria as a game room and to con-
vert the existing game and lobby

area into a rathskeller-type cof-
feehouse, with a dance floor.
Plans are also being made to re-
model the patio for use during the
warmer months.

“The administration places as
a high priority the need for a bet-
ter Student Union. They have allo-
cated these funds as a result of
conversations between Dr. Moye,
his staff, and the Student Govern-

- ment — maybe with the Task

Force we can get the funds for a
new Union or an addition to the
present one,” Bluey said.

When speaking of his views on
the facility,_ Bluey said, “The Uni-
versity will favor remodeling the
present building, but I would like
to see us build a large structure
that would contain a 10-12 thou-
sand seat gymnasium, an audi-
torium with student activities and
recreational areas around this
core.”

It is conceivable that the new
structure would be on the lower
campus, providing a new, more
accessable space for basketball

games, and thus make funding
more feasible with aid from both
the Athletic Department and the
alumni.

Such a facility would be open to
the community, thus helping to
ease University—community rela-
tionships and might even be self-
sustaining as an auditorium for
rock concerts and the like, but
Blueyadded that such a facility
seems a long way off.

The committee comprises all
the major areas of the University
and has 13 members, eight of
which will represent student or-
ganizations. Bluey has set three
goals for the first meeting: to es-
tablish the need for a new ‘Union,
to establish a general plan for the
structure, its location and its
funding, and to elect a permanent
chairman.

The Task Force’s first meeting,
which will be held in room 520,
Cathedral of Learning, on Mon-
day, Sept. 25, will be open to all
interested parties.

BAS Combats Drug Use

The Black Action Society has begun a ‘drug re-

chairman of the BAS, explained that such a program

drugs on campus.” She mentioned, however, that

the BAS would not take on the program directly but
rather would refer people with a drug problemto

Ile Elegba. ,

What is Ile Elegba? “It’s a community based
organizationtwith experienced counselors who can
help people with a drug problem,” Fuller explained.
She added, “Counseling is not available here (i.e., '
at the BAS) so the best thing is referral to Ile

Elegba.” -

Fuller continued, “Most of the Blacks on this
campus are familiar with Ile Elegba. .
the counselors were Pitt students or are known to
the students. The best thing about this organization
is that it’s easily gotten to.” She went on to cite sev-
eral examples where a phone call made an instant

Pittsburgh, included under the
Ohio-Pennsylvania‘ heading, is
part of a nationwide campaign in
which the Young Socialists send
teams of approximately 50 people
to canvass a general area. '

Glenn Campbell, a member of‘
the regional team, explained that
the party hopes to inform the pub-

The candidates for the Socialist

while Pulley is an active member

Both Jenness and Pulley are in
their twenties, well below the pre-
scribed Constitutional age of 35.

“We believe that anyone who

He added that the party has
three major issues: Women’s Lib-

the Anti-War Movement.

In Women’s Liberation, the ma-
jor focus will be on the repeal of

Fuller put it, “The community ‘is part of our organ-

said. '

Regarding Black Liberation, the
party will emphasize Black con-
trol of the Black community. One
of the ways this can best be ac-
complished, according to party
literature, is by establishment of
an independent black political
party. .

Finally, concerning the Anti-
War Movement, Socialist workers
advocate immediate withdrawal
of American forces from Asia and
intend to support all related move-
ments.

Other party issues concern Chi-

and child care.

WORSE THAN A PARKING TICKET. Although

parking rates are exorbitant

throughout the Oakland area and the meter maids are unbelievably sly;

this unfortunate probably wishes he had taken his chances on the street  

 

rather than trying to save a buck by parking on the Forbes Field site. . 

But how was he to know that a sudden .rain fall would convert the. 
inviting lot into a -swamp? At least it made the flowers bloom. Now a_n- , 
other type of rain will be falling on the students who have been parking

there.

Paul S. Popovich, Parking Administrator, has announced that cars  
parked on some posted portions of Forbes Field will be ticketed. He noted ' "A

that a few spaces may be made available at the site in the future, but _}..;:
commuters will have to wait until the boundaries of the University can- 

struction areas are set.

John H. Gibbon, Jr., M.D.. the
pioneer in the development of the
heart-lung machine which has
made heart surgery possible, will
receive the University’s third
Dickson Prize in Medicine on Oct.
12 in a presentation ceremony to
be held at 5 p.m. in Scaife Hall
Auditorium, Terrace and DeSoto
Sts.

Dr. Gibbon, the Samuel D. Gross

_ Emeritus Professor of Surgery
and former chairman of the De-.

partment of Surgery at Jefferson
Medical College, Thomas Jeffer-
son University, Philadelphia, Pa.,
is a graduate of Princeton Univer-
sity and the Jefferson Medical
College. He» interned at Pennsyl-
vania Hospital and then served as
a research fellow in surgery at
Harvard Medical School under Dr.
Edward D. Churchill. He later
served as fellow in medicine and
the Harrison Fellow ‘of Surgical
Research at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

Dr. Gibbon first became inter-
ested in an extracorporeal device
to perform the functions of the
heart and lungs and began work

_on it during the 1930s. Following

service in the U.S. Army during
World War II, he continued to pur-

currently waging battles for in-
clusion in Ohio and California.

Campbell admitted the chances
of victory “aren’t that excellent”
but added that the party hoped to
reach a large number of people
through its campaign and educate
them as to what needs to be done.

“What is needed are. mass
movements,” he said. “The social
system.won’t change because of
the election. We’re not trying to
pull McGovern to the left, as has
been claimed.

“We won't support McGovern
because he is a ‘lesser evil’ than
Nixon. We know what happened in
’64 and '68.”

‘ Campbell added that the Social-

Contrary to previous rumors. the Universitys filst annual Lan-
tern Night will be held on Sunday. The oldest tradition on campus. Lan-
tern Night is a ceremor_1y which welcomes all freshman women into the
Universi_ty community.

In a symbolic gesture. each young woman receives a lantern from
a University alumni, to signify the passing of truth and light from gen-
eration to generation. ‘

Past critics of Lantern Night have felt that the ritual needs updat-
ing and revision to be a meaningful success. Consequently the sponsor,
AWS, Alumni and Association and its president, Ellen Ganley, in co-
operation with Andrea Russon, chairman of Lantern Night, have con-
centrated on its improvement.

Many campus organizations such as Ecology Action. the Commu-
ter Association, the Panhellenic Association. Angel Flight. Pitt Hosts.
and CWENS have been invited to participate in the program. After the
lantern ceremony. freshmen will be cn_couraged to talk with the various
organizations. ,

Lantern Night will be held in the Carnegie Music Hall. with a re-
ception of cookies and punch afterward in the adjacent fo_\'er. while the
Women’s Choral Group and the Men‘s Glee Club will provide entertain-
ment throughout. L

A great deal of the preparation for the 1972 Lantern Night has been
handled by Thyra Ballantyne. associate dean oi Development in Alumni

  Ravi Shankar Opens r

Season at Heinz Hall

by BARBARA GERAUD

The world’s most famous guru and one of its finest musicians will
open the second season at Heinz Hall on Sept. 24 at 7:30 p.m. Ravi Shan-
kar, Indian poet, composer, philosopher and educator, will perform the
first concert in a diversified series.

Joining him will be the saucer—eyed Buddha, Alla Rakha, a master
of the tabla, and Kamala on tamboura (she’s the one that shakes her
head all the time). They appeared with Ravi at the concert for Bangla-
desh, and are his usual backup group. "

Ravi is a walking storehouse of the artistic heritage of one of the
world’s oldest cultures. But more than that, he is probably the most
gifted and imaginative master of improvisation that the musical world
has ever encountered.

It would be difficult to conceive of anything more exciting, in terms
of pure animal joy, than the climactic passages of one of his impro-
visations. Yet at the same time the intellectual process of creation
which goes into all of his performances is something which never takes

' second place to the profound emotionalism of his music.

Ravi was born in Benares, the youngest of four sons in an orthodox
Hindu Brahmin family. Raised by his mother and older brothers, Ravi

-went to Europe at the age of nine as part of the famous company of In-

dian dancers and musicians organized by his" brother, Uday Shankar,
one of India’s finest dancers. The troupe made.Paris its headquarters;
from there, Ravi toured everywhere, “learning everything. I danced,
played all the instruments, and eventually began writing—poetry, plays
—-and I evenpainted.”

Today, Ravi feels that his work has not yet really begun. He feels
again the urge to. widen his activities—not in terms of returning to the
days of his youth when he dabbled in all the arts, but as a broadening

.of his musical activity. Ballet and orchestral music, he believes, are

the best outlets for the future.

When Ravi performs a particular piece, his playing is almost all
improvisation on a foundation consisting of a kind of scale (or “melo-
dy form”) known as Raga, with and ascending (Arohanal and a des-
cending (Avarohana) mode, and a “rhythmic cycle” known as Tala.

Perhaps the best description of the music can come from Ravi
himself—“Through the freshness of the spontaneous creation, a heady
and trance-like feeling is felt by the listener, and it is true that one can
feel “high” and reach a state of euphoria through_this music alone,
without any help of extra stimulus."

Tickets for the Shankar concert are $5.50, $4.50 and $3.50—on sale
at Kaufmann’s, Horne’s, G_imbel’s, National Record Marts and the
Heinz Hall Box Office. Students will receive a 20 percent discount with
current ID cards atthe Heinz Hall Box Office‘.

pate in this year’s Activities Fair

 First, McGovern feels that the

‘sufficient to meet all credible se-
"ficurity threats and U.S. interna-

serve to repress internal dissen-
sion, can be suspended, and that a
greater measure of self-defense
can be applied in a number of cri-
tical confrontation areas such as
Korea and Europe.

Supportive of the initial phases
of the SALT agreements, McGov-
ern differs sharply with the ad-
ministration policy of calling for
the production of new weapons
systems like ‘the B-lbomber and
the Trident submarine to build
the U.S. bargainer’s “position of
strength” for future negotiations.
He feels that further expansion of
our nuclear deterrentwill only
serve to jeopardize the effect of.
that deterrent by forcing the So-
viets into accelerated weapons
production. And even Melvin
Laird admits that we have stock-
piled more than twice as many
long-range nuclear weapons as
the Soviets.

Closely related to the sufficien-
cy concept is McGovern’s conten-
tion that foreign policy tools other
than our military presence can be
employed to achieve most inter-
national objectives. He has“ in
mind the Vietnam tragedy when
he says: “This alternative budget
rejects the notion that military
might is the only method by which
the United States can fulfill inter-
national responsibilities_ and
-‘serve the cause of freedom.
And it incorporates some of the
painful lessons of recent ,years,
about the military damage done
to helpless people in freedom’s
name.” \

His second premise ’ involves
trimming the fat from the remain-
ing military establishment that is
deemed sufficient to meet nation-
al needs. Generals in command of
five or ten-man units and exces-'
sive reliancegon legions of support
personnel behind each combat GI
add nothing to national security
and could be safely phased out of

Editor's Note: This is the first in
a series of debates between

These articles will not neces-
sarily reflect the official posi-
tions, but rather the opinions
of the individual writers.

More serious than waste in allo-
cation of personnel are the mas-
sive losses involved in defense
contract cost overruns. George
McGovern would like to see waste
and inefficiency involved ‘in mili-
tary procurements identified and
corrected in the same fashion as
have been similar practices in
other government agencies. Crit-
ics of federal bureaucracy should
consider the $36.5 billion recently
lost in cost overruns on 77 weap-
ons systems.

His final premise with regard
to a proper defense posture con-
cerns the need for reliance on
more simplified and less elab-
orate weapons systems that can
adequately perform their roles
as part of a total weapons arsenal.
This does not mean a return to the
catapult and the bow and arrow;
McGovern’s alternative budget
allots $5.5 billion fo‘r weapons re-
search, only $700 million lessitha
the current level. ~

From either a domestic or a
foreign policy point of view. the
administration argument for a
massive defense establishment
stands as indefensible. While the
application of deficit spending in
the form of more tanks. guns. and

Administration Reverses
Spending Priorities

by LYNN J. ALSTADT
Chairman, College Young
Republicans

The Nixon Administration has
reversed federal budget priorities
by interchanging the 1968 budget
percentages being‘ spent for de-
fense and human resources. Only
32 per cent of the 1973 federal bud-
get will be spent for national de-
fense (compared to 45. per cent in
1968). The 1963 defense budget
imposes the smallest economic
burden upon the country of any de-
fense budget in more than 20
years. In dollar terms. the new
defense budget is $6.8 billion be-
low the prewar level (fiscal 1964).

The President has made these
defense budget cuts as a part of a
larger program to improve our
national defense system. This
progressive reorganization has
brought an increase in military
pay, ‘an end to the unfair draft, the
withdrawl of nearly 90 per cent of
‘American troops from‘ Vietnam.

bal arms limitations. and the cre-
ation of an all-volunteer army by

ments in the defense -program
have been made while cutting the
price.

Those who propose massive cuts
in our defense budget are advocat-
ing a perilous course of action
which implies a superficial un-
derstanding of our national de-
fense system. Over half of the de-
fense budget is for personnel, both
civilian and military. Only 10 per
cent of the defense budget is
used for research and develop-
ment. A cut in defense spending
means either a cut in military
pay, which would jeopardize the
success of an all-volunteer army‘,
or a cut in weaponry, which would
destroy the possibility of mutual
or global arms limitations.

Don’t be fooled by misguided
retoric about cutting‘ the defense

' budget. President Nixon has es-

tablished a realistic defense pro-
gram which will ensure the se-
curity of the United States while
allowing negotiations for mutual
arms reductions. He will spend
neither more,nor less than is he-
cessary to protect our national
security and create a lasting
peace in our time.

the Editor

didn’t seem to me that the Dem
ocratic Convention was a "Cos-
tra Nostra" style "coup d etat"
(except for the California Creden-
tials challenge, which read more

like a finely woven murder plot).

But then. I was probably sacked
in by liberal propaganda. right
Armond?

Accusing McGovern of being
a hypocrite, besides being a case
of the pot calling the kettle black,

V just goes to show how little he

really knows in contrast to what he
thinks he knows. Sure, he couldn’t

' get‘ his welfare proposals right

the first time, and yes, dumping
Eagleton was a pretty bad move.
But can you really say that Mc-
Govern has waffled on princi-
ple? He’s still going to pull our
troops out of General Thieu’s play-
ground in 90 days, he still in-
tends to change the welfare laws
in favor of the poor and pay for
it at the expense of the rich by

, closing those ridiculous tax loop-

holes through which billions of
dollars sink every year, and he
still intends to grant amnesty to
the real patriots of our country,
those who refused to be drafted
in order to commit genocide in
Southeast Asia for the conven-
ience of the military-industrial
complex. (Lots of cliches there,
but I haven't got time to be ori-
ginal. Sorry ‘bout that.) One state-
ment from McGovern on princi-
pies’ is worth a thousand, nay,
a million “Fast Eddie” Cox “Rap
sessions.” (Closed to anyone who
might ask him if he's ever actu-
ally met a college student he-
fore,‘of course.)

And though McGovern’s not
perfect, is Nixon that much in the
running for the title? With the
state of unemployment, inflation.
the war, and the ability of the
moneyed ‘interests to manipulate
the government, the pundits should
be comparing Nixon to Herbert
Hoover rather than contrasting
McGovern with Alf Landon. Un-
fortunately, Nixon has a talent for
being able to piss on people’s
heads and call it rain. So. Get
The Hell Out And Vote For
McGovern! As for Armond Ham-
mer. well. next time try Cloak

pie!" ’ _

At Cox Conference

By VIRGINIA COOK

“For its part, government
will listen. We will strive to
listen in new ways—to‘the
voices that speak without
words, the voices of the heart
—to the injured voices, and
anxious voices, the voices that
have despaired of bein'g'heard.”

Richard Nixon
Inaugural address

And that is what we were-
the voices who had despaired of
being heard. I was one of the
students who was refused admit-
tance to Edward Cox’s press con-
ference last week. And in the in-
tervening period I have tried to
find out why.

Some investigation revealed
that the Kurtzman Room had been
reserved by the Young Republicans
for a press conference September
11. According to the reservation
request, “students, university ad-
ministration, faculty, alumni,
non-universi_ty groups and the
news media,” were to be admitt-
ed to the conference.

Lynn Alstadt, the chairman of

"she College Young Republicans.

who had made the room reserva-
tion, told me that up until 10
minutes before tllle news confer-
ence, it had been his impression
that everyone would be admitted.

But'shortly before it was to be-
gin, "The advance man told me
he was concerned students would
be making a play for the press,"
Alstadt said. It was then decid-
ed to seperate Cox’s press confer-
ence with his rap session with stu-
dents.

It is considered legitimate when
a VIP visits campus to make a

room available to him to meet
with members of the press. as-
suming he intends to make his
visit in some way relevant to the
University community.

The time Cox spent with that
community in the union’ lobby
was considerably less than the
time he spent talking to the press,
which caused one student to re-
mark “Who is he here for? The
sign says he’s here for us, not for
the press.”

After listening to Cox in the
lobby. I was asked to show my
press card to gain readmittance
to the Kurtzman room. I was un-
able to do this because the Pitt
News had only made arrange-

ments to.have.pictures taken for ’

press cards that evening.

Now that would have been a
legitimate reason" to deny me
admittance to the conference it
and only if it had been restrict~
ed solely to card-carrying mem-
bers of the press. (In fact, I talk-
ed to one young man who had a
press card from another univer-
sity newspaper who was refused
admittance.)

The fact is that students who
had been "smart enough to stay in
the Kurtzman room and had not
been obligated, as I had been, to
cover Cox’s remarks in the lobby,
were not asked to leave and were
allowed to stay. Those students
who were readmitted from the
lobby were “college Republicans
who got in on my recognizance

. which is not unusual,” Al-
stadt said. “Most press conferen-
ces are done that way.”

What I am challenging is the
administration representatives‘

was a chance you were not Re-

other political beliefs, and wheth-
er or not you carried a press card,-
yours was a voice that the admin-
istrations representatives did not
want to hear.

Many students were locked out-
side the Kurtzman room with me.
Some banged on the doors trying
to get the books they had left
on chairs while they went out to
the lobby, some supported the Pre-
sident. some were members of
SDS. and one was a Vietnam vet-
eran. We were all locked out by
administration representatives who
not only refused to listen to us.
butrefused to let us listen.

HICKEY AND BOGGS is so
awful that it almost reconciles
one to that other less than dynam-
ic duo, Nixon and Agnew. Some
enterprising producer thought he
would make his fortune by team-
ing Bill Cosby and Robert Culp
as two divorced detectives hot on
the trail of loot stolen from Pitts-
burgh National Bank. He will

. certainly lose even more than our

lending institution.

I never cared for this pair on
television, finding their allegedly
witty conversations nothing but
an endless stream of nonsensical
chatter. This time their badinage
is not even, coherent. let along
allegedly witty.

Cosby commits cold-blooded
murder with impunity (something
we will see more “heroes” doing
since the tremendous success of
THE GODFATHER, but since
his co-star directed this mess, it
is he who is the more culpable.

; Wall. a 6-3. 190 pound athlete from Monessen. Pa.. had vol-
untarily retired from collegiate football 16 days earlier. near
the conclusion of summer camp in Johnstown. Pa. It was said
that Lance left summer camp because of pain in his knee. a knee
‘-—_.Vl‘ll.Cl1 had. undergone surgery after the fourth game of the 1971
season. against Navy. Wall went down while playing in the de-
fensive seconday.

 1 It was also said at Johnstown that Wall didn't like the idea
of not running as the ‘first line split end. a fosition he had been
ggvitched to in Spring practice.   — '

 With the graduation of Steve
Mayer, Joel Klimek and Doug
(linden, Carl DePasqua looked
. to Wall for his 4.6 speed in the A _

vfsry sticky pair of hands to
help fill an apparent void in

 "'I had pain in my knee and I was having problems at home.
The, whole scene got me down." Wall said after Monday night's
txpractice. "But I went home and got my problems straightened

 T“I wanted to play in the Florida State game. I didn’t, so I

',‘e'eided to go all out against UCLA.” '
And that's the reason Wall was happy.

__, In the UCLA game. Wall was a positive factor in the Cats

treriiendous second half comeback. His first reception of the
year was an eight yard touchdown pass from John Hogan. Wall
was pretty well wrapped up in the end zone.'but still managed
. ‘.0 make the reception.

fig In the waining moments of that game Lance battled a pretty
g,‘orsd UCLA'defender in the corner of the opposite end zone to
- make another touchdown reception—this one for 23 yards, also
from Hogan. _ »

_ Inbetween those two catches. Wall received a Bob Medwid
?;as:s. which gave the Panthers a crucial first down enroute to

 Bem:s- a Pitt Tra rtron 

.2. ° _ .. E
by BART MAC-K SI years. Pitt has won the Western Pennsylvania Con-

It has been two decades since the first varsity

soccer team took the field representing the Univer- .

sity and a lot of things have'changed in~those 20
years——with one exception.

Leo Bemis fielded that first team back in 1953
and this season he is celebrating his 20th anniver-
sary as the booter’s mentor. In an age where varsi-
ty coaches come and go like flies, the fact that Be-
mis remainsas Pitt’s soccer coach must mean that
the man can’t be doing much wrong.

Pitt traditionally plays the best established col-
lege teams they can schedule, but Bemis has met
thechallenge year after year and his record has
proven him a consistent winner.

With only one game played so far this season,
Bemis’ career coaching record stands at 100 wins,
77 losses and 15 ties. While this may average out
to only five victories per season, there are certain
facts that should be considered when assessing the
won-lost statistics.

In the early years of the soccer teams’ exis-
tence. it annually played some of the toughest
teams in the nation: Army. Navy and Michigan
State were always traditional rivals for the Panthers.

Another fact is that very rarely did the men
that manned those initial squads have much,’ if any,

previous soccer experience. Two of Pitt’s All-

Americans and a number of NCAA District and
Most Valuable players never played organized soc-
cer before coming to the University.

Although Bemis himself did not play soccer in
college, his knowledge of the sport will cover any
and all aspects. A 1941 graduate of Edinboro State
College, Bemis played three years of football and
was a member of the wrestling and baseball squads.
He completed his Masters Degree in Physical Ed-

.. ucation from Pitt in 1947.

In addition to coaching, Bemis has served as
director of Pitt’s expanding intramural sports pro-
gram since 1947. Beginning this fall he has also as-
sumed the job of facilities coordinator.

In 1970, Bemis was instrumental in the forma- ',

tion of the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Con-

ference Championship the past two years, last sea-
son with a 5-0 mark. and is likely to repeat its per-
formance this year.

Bemis marked the beginning of his 20th season
with his 100th career coaching  -' -- ‘ '
victory last Saturday at Lewis-
burg, Pa. The booters downed
Bucknell University for the first
time on the Bison’s home field
by a 2-0 score. Ironically, Be-
mis’ 100th win was over Craig
Reynolds, formerly an assistant
soccer coach to Bemis in 1967.

The 100th victory was cer-
tainly a milestone for Pitt soc-
cer, but Bemis confessed that there is another pla-
teau he would like to reach. '

    

BEMIS

“Eight wins in a season is the most we’ve ever
had,” Bemis remarked. “I’d like to have a nine win
season or even a 10-0 or an 11-0.”

A "SNEAK PREVIEW of this year's promising Pan-
ther basketball team will take place on Wednes-
day, Nov. 4, .at the Field House. At 8 that night,
the team will hold an intra-squad game. There will
be no admission charge for Pitt students.

The hoop team will begin workouts on Oct. 15
and for the first few weeks, freshmen and upper-
classmen will work out together. The regular sea-
son gets underway on Nov. 29 when Mt. Union
College visits the Field House. '

There is going to be a tough battle for posi-
tions on the varsity team, with a total of seven
recruits seeking to oust some of last year's players.

Just as with,the football team, last year's
freshman team will be replaced by a junior varsity
team. The iayvee team will play a similar schedule
to last year, against other JV teams and the area's
small-college varsity teams.

Enthusiasm is running _about the hoop team, _A

which boasts six returning letteymen including All-
American candidate Billy Knight. « A

Transmission Trouble
Plagues Pitt Javelin

Due to severe complications of
a makeshift transmission. the Pitt
Javelin failed to complete the Na-
tional Sportscar Race at Warren.
Ohio. this past Sunday.

Although the car was able to
move from last place to the third
position. through galant efforts to
keep the car running. the tempor-
ary transmission was unable to
withstand the enormous pres-
sures of the race.

The loss drops the Javelin to
third place in their division as the
team travels to the Pocono Moun-
tain Speedway for next weeks
race.

Even though the loss at Warren
was disappointing, there was good

DIVING tryouts for Pitt's varsi-
ty swim team will be held next
week on Monday, Sept. 25.

These tryouts will take place
at Trees Hall Pool and will go
from 4-6 p.m. Anyone interest-
ed in joining the diving team
should contact Dick Bradshaw

news for the Road Race team as
it‘ was revealed that the Universi-
ty’s Executive Engineering Com-
mittee has decided to actively
participate with the team.

This participation by the engi-
neering department has beena
personal goal for the race t.eam
and will undoubtedly have a great
deal to do with the Javelin‘s suc-
cess.

Instead of using private indus-
try for car developments the team
will -now be able to use the re-
sources and intellects .of all the
departments of engineering here
at the University.

A new phase of interest will
soon be completed as the road
racing team announced that a stu-
dent merchandise program will
be available to all students of the
University in about two weeks.

What this means is that students
will be able to acquire such items
as cameras, stereos, and other
items in the student spectrum at
a discount rate of 20-30 percent.

Further information will be an-
nounced as soon as it is possible.

  At Trees

Today

The Pitt mittmen take on their
first real competition when they
face an exceptionally strong Point
Park squad Wednesday at 3:30
p.m. at Trees Field.

The Pioneers are fresh off a
very impressive doubleheader
sweep of Frostberg College. Jim
Ney received the credit for the
9-5 rout in the first game as he
got a homer from Joe Zyra to help
him along. Paul Palmer relieved
Fred McColead in the second
game and picked up the victory
with the aid of a Lou Abel home
run.

Coach Lewis of Pitt has any one
of nine possible pitchers who are
ready if called upon to face the
Pioneers. Al Sylanski and John
Chir are probable starters. but no
decision has been finalized as of
now.

Lewis was very much impress-
ed with his teams easy victory
over Steubenville and feels it was

"an indication of the team's poten-

tial.
