Every week, a tractor—trailer truck

the four Original Hot Dog Shops in
Pittsburgh.

Sometimes it’s two per week, according
to “O” owner Sidney Simon.

Simon, who owns the shops in
Oakland, at Carnegie Mellon University, in
Plum and on the South Side, started the
famous restaurant nearly 40 years ago, in
May 1960.

Simon opened the House of Beef next

Candidates continue presidential duel in courts

The lawsuits ﬁled by George W. Bush in the U.S.
Supreme Court and Al Gore in the Florida Supreme
Court were prepared for this weekend’s decisive hear-
ing segments.

Bush’s ﬁling will be heard by the high court today
at 10 a.m. The Bush camp’s lawsuit concerns Gore’s
requests for manual recounts on Nov. 21.

Yesterday, both teams of lawyers submitted their
briefs to the court. ’

The Bush team said that the Florida Supreme
Court did not follow the legal guidelines according to
Florida legislation. They also said that if they win this
case, Gov. Bush’s lead in Florida should return to 930
— the results certiﬁed by Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris on Nov. 18.

_ The Bush team warned that if the Florida Supreme
Court’s decision is not revoked, then the Florida courts
could pick one set of electors while the Florida legisla-
ture would choose another — creating another conﬂict.

The lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court for
“legal ﬁnality.”

The Gore tearn’s briefs said that this is a state issue
and that the U.S. Supreme Court has no place in it.
Lawyers claimed that Florida Supreme Court’s deci-
sion was valid.

Gore’s lawyers explained that regardless of the
outcome, “There can be no judicial remedy,” that even-
tually Congress will decide.

Only two hours, earlier, another Gore team of
lawyers in Tallahasseecontinued its suit involving a
recount in three Florida counties. Lawyers. said they
hope to be allowed another manual recount.

Leon County Circuit Courtludge N, Sanders Saul
did not grant Gore his request for a recount, but he did
arrange for all of the ballots from Miami-Dade and
Palm Beach counties to ‘be brought to the court in
Tallahassee. Today he will consider whether or not
they should be recounted.

Gore spoke Tuesday and said, “I believe it is
essential to our country that there be no cloud over the
head of the next president, whether it be me or Gov.
Bush.” ‘ .

Bush’s lawyer Barry Richard argued that the court
could not make a decision until both sides had agreed
upon the central issues of the case. Gore’s lawyer

A David Boise responded that Richard was just trying to

delay the court case as long as possible.

Despite all pending lawsuits, the Bush team con-
tinues its transition to the White House.‘

Yesterday, Dick Cheney, Bush’s running mate and
head of the transition team, armounced that the team,
which was denied government frmding and ofﬁce
space, set up in McLean, Va. ‘

Also, Gen. Colin Powell is expected to go to Texas

today and speak with Bush about the transition. Bush
reportedly wants Powell to be his, Secretary of State,
but it is unknown whether Powell would accept.

Sergeant Rich Wemer earns his college
tuition by blowing things up.

At the outlook point on Blue Mountain
at Fort Indiantown National Guard military
base, Werner trains in his ﬁre support team
vehicle, a machine that looks somewhat
like a tank Instead of a cannon, the vehicle
sports a laser designed to ﬁnd the coordi-
nates of enemy targets. '

The outlook point looks over a scarred

target area, littered with defunct tanks and
other brokenidown equipment The ground
is yellow and marked from constant assault
with devastating explosives. The surround-
ing hillside is covered with dead trees.

Once a month, Wemer’s unit —- the
28th Infantry Division, 107th Artillery --
must attend a weekend-long training ses-
sion at as military base, usually in the
Pittsburgh area. Earlierthis month, mem-
bers of the infantry went to Indiantown Gap
because it is well-suited for artillery train-
mg.

Wemer is a forward observer. It is his
job to be “the eyes for the guns.” Vlfrth a
‘team and his ﬁre ‘support vehicle, Wemer
ventures out in front of the larger tanks and
Howitzers to ﬁnd the target’s exact loca-
tion. This is done using the laser mounted
on the vehicle and detailed drawings of the
battleﬁeld.

Once they ﬁnd the target, the heavy
artillery gets a call to “rain down death and

‘destruction upon the bad guys,” as

Specialist Tim Davis, another forward
observer, put it.

But the death and destruction comes
later. Before any ﬁring commences, sur-
veyors must make certain that the target
area is clear so no one is injured by the 50-
meter blast radius of the l55—rnillimeter

shells soon to be launched by the
Howitzers.

The soldiers must also ensure that the
guns are on target, because there is very lit-
tle room for error when operating these
powerful weapons. The Howitzers have a
ﬁring range of 24,000 meters, and some
houses lie within that distance.

Werner uses this time to establish com-
munication with ﬂue two ﬁre support team
vehicles on‘ either side of him and the
Howitzers a mile to his left. The other men
mill around the outlook point, chatting and
admiring the new targets they have to
destroy — a helicopter, an ambulance and
a police car — in the valley below.

The day began at 4:30 a.m., the same
time as the day before. Many of the soldiers
stayed up until rnidnightior later the previ-
ous evening, drinking and gambling. Rows
of crew-cut soldiers rose from their bunks
lethargically, padding across the concrete
barracks ﬂoor to the showers, in no rush to
eat their mess hall breaﬂasts of powdered
eggs, French toast and bacon.

After breakfast, the soldiers headed out ’

onto the base. Fort Indiantown Gap is a
massive base featuring line upon line of
identical buildings with white siding and
green trim. 8

Still inside the banacks, Pvt. Adam
Baker, a Pitt sophomore, geared up for his
job onroad guard. Baker’s duty was to
make sure no errant motorists drove A in
front of the tanks as the convoy headed for
the ﬁring range.

Buckling his belt that holds ammo
clips and two canteens around his waist and
strapping his gas mask around his leg,
Baker discussed the situation he got into
during basic training.

Many college students join the Guard
to earn money ‘for school, but this money-

. Student Govemment‘Board’s October
referendum changing the tenure of the
board members was met with some opposi-
tion during its two weeks in the public eye.

The contentions began with board
member Dave Lander asking. that the
Constitutional Review Committee — the
body in charge of recommending the
change — be - suspended so that their
actions could be reviewed. '

Lander’s requests were heard and
passed but the board was reinstated less
than a week later.

But another change in the SGB’s con-

stitution may
  News  
Analysrs

The referen-

dum, which changed the time of SGB’s
election to April, ‘did not address the fol-
lowing clause, which states, ‘The board
shall take ofﬁce on the ﬁrst day of classes of
the winter term.”

While there hasn’t been a winter term
at Pitt for several years, SGB’s constitution
refers speciﬁcally to “fall” and “spring”
terms. ‘ —

“The CRC is by no means done,” said
Lee Rutledge, a CRC member. “We’ll con-
tinue to work and smooth out problems,” he
said .

Rutledge said that the CRC wanted to
make the change before the election so can-
didates knew exactly how long they would
beinoﬁ'1ce.Healsoadmitsthatthereare
many small ﬂaws in the document.

“The constitution is outdated. It’s not a
good document,” Rutledge said.

Others in SGB feel that the problem

sary to ﬁllﬁll the
full intent of the

can be easily resolved. .

“The intention is clear,” said President
Joan Snyder. “Our parliamentarian went
through and said that it’s left up to interpre-
tation.”

She added that the new board needs to
get together and start talking about changes.

“Bylaw changes also have to happen,
and they are happening, slowly,” Snyder
said.

President-elect Mike Unangst said that
he hopes the CRC will put together a com-
prehensive package of changes in the
future. -

' “Coming up with more changes was
something we were advocating from the
beginning,” Unangst said. “It’s more elli-
cient and economical to do them at once.
This way, the students can Vote on each
change at the ‘same time.” A

Most of the bylaw changes that SGB‘ is A

currently considering concern implications
from the referendum. Major changes
include adding a clause to replace an elect-
ed board member if he or she resigns. The
proposed clause allows the student popula-
tion to know about the vacancy, but a new-’
election will not be held. Instead, the pro-
posal states that the position will be ﬁlledtby
a two—thirds vote of the remaining board
members. A O

‘ The proposed changes would also add
responsibilities for the president ,pro-tem-

pore. Additional tasks include keeping»-an ‘

attendance and participation record of all
students appointed to standing committees
of the University Senate, task forces and ad

-hoc committees. Also, the pro-tempore will

serve as coordinator for the Student
Leadership Forums and shall oversee the

appointments of students to the University _

Senate committees.

Bylaw changes do not have to be put to
student vote. Instead, a majority of the
board must approve. '

making scheme backﬁred for Baker. There
were not enough recruits to start training
when Baker ﬁrst arrived at basic training,
so the soldier-to-be had to wait until more
men reported.

When enough men did arrive, it was
evident training would not end until Sept.
28, a month into Pitt’s semester, making it
impossible to attend classes, Baker said.

After joining, Baker decided he want-
ed out, but by then it was too late. .

“’Ihey’ll throw you in jail before they
let you out,” Baker said. “It makes you
angry, but you deal with it.”

While some of the men practiced on a
ﬁre support team vehicle simulator, the real
action took place on Blue Mountain. The
area was clear, and the soldiers had the
Howitzers on target. The ﬁring could begin.

From inside the conﬁnes of a ﬁre sup-
port team vehicle, a loud voice cried,

More than a mile away, an indistinct
piece of refuse disappeared in a vast cloud
of black smoke.

About six seconds later, the explosion
rumbled up the mountainside. When the
rumble reached the lookout point, it was
still forceful enough to shake the observers.

The next shell sent balls of golden
sparks into the air, setting the dry‘ brush
around the impact area on ﬁre. It blazed for
most of the afternoon, scorching several

Davis said the life expectancy of a for-
ward observer once combat begins is very
short. Davis, who has served under con-
stant risk as a submariner in the Navy, said
he doesn’t think about the threat of combat.

“You just don’t think about it, because
if you do, you’re going to make a mistake.
And if you do that you and your friends are
going to die,” he said.

Specialist Bob Monticelli is a member
of a Colt recomraissance team. Colt teams
go deeper into battle than the ﬁre support

team vehicles, often behind enemy lines to ..

scout out targets for when the infantry
moves in. Because his job involves greater
risks, it follows that the mortality rate of
those who have that particular job is greater
as well. 0
Monticelli, whose father was an active
member of the military in the 1960s, want-

ed to join the military since he was a little
kid. He said that if he is called to battle, he
would never question the orders, but he
hopes that call never oornes.

Some of the men in Monticelli’s unit
have seen action in Bosnia, Somalia and
the Gulf War, and related their stories to
soldiers who have not yet seen action.

“You listen to these old guys and’

realize you don’t want to see combat,”
Monticelli said. “They make you see the
truth.”

Monticelli said he also doesn’t think
about the threat of death in a combat situ-
ation.

“Every grunt on the ground is in the
same position as you,” he said. “The
Army says there’s a 50 percent casualty
rate, so one in two guys are going to get
messed up,” he said. .

Murphy’s new conciliatory

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy announced last week
that he scrapped his original
plans for the “Market Place at
Fifth and Forbes,” a plan
unveiled last spring for the
Downtown revitalization. This
change came about because
Nordstrom, the anchor store of
the project, backed out of the
deal, as did Murphy’s partner in
the venture, Chicago—based
Urban Retail Properties.

In the last week, Murphy
has taken a more conciliatory
approach to the project —
rather than threatening unilater-
ally to do the project, Murphy
is negotiating with the groups
involved to come to a compro-
mise.

Last spring, Murphy had
threatened to use eminent
domain, which is any govern-
mental entity’s power to force
owners of buildings to sell in
the name of “public interest,” to

' implement the revitalization.

Murphy’s use of a more
conciliatory approach is the
best outcome for all parties. No
matter the disagreements on

  approach to Fifth/ Forbes needed

downtown areas that are alive
and booming after 6 p.m., but
we do not.

Some will say that nothing 7

should be done at all and that
Downtown should remain as is;
many will argue that, no matter
what, people will not come to
the city for entertainment. But
this runs counter to the experi-
ence of many other cities. For
example, several years ago sub-
urbanites in Baltimore did not
dare venture into‘/the city, but
now it thrives.

Unfortunately, progress
always comes at a price. But the
benefits usually outweigh the
costs. With the Homestead
Waterfront now booming, very
few remember the steel mill
that existed on the site before.
And how many people still

’ complain about Pitt Stadium’s

demolition?

By agreeing to work with
the businesses located
Downtown and with the
Pittsburgh History and
Landmarks Foundation,

Murphy is making sure that this
revitalization will happen, and

School of the Americ

Dear Mom and Dad,

Guess what I did last weekend? I got on a bus
with a bunch of union leaders, church people and
other students and went to a huge protest at the
Army "School of the  Fort Benning,
Ga . . \_

The School‘ of the Americas is a military
institution run - by the‘ U.S. government. SOA
graduates are responsible for along
listofhumanrights abuses inLatin KATE
America For example, in 1981 in
El Salvador, a brutal massacre took
place when an army battalion
slaughtered more than 900
unarmed men, women and children. Ten of the 12
oflicers who were responsible were SOA gradu-
ates.

The recent protest was held on Nov. 19 to
commemorate the anniversary of the murder of

_ six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her teen-

age daughter. The ldllings took place in El
Salvador in 1989, and of the 26 oﬁicers found to
be responsible by a UN. Truth Commission, 19
were trained at the SOA- _

SOA graduates have also been responsible
for the assassination of Archbishop Oscar
Romero, the Uraba massacre in Colombia, the la
Cantuta massacre in Peru and hundreds of other
human rights crimes in Latin America.
Essentially, our tax dollars are supporting what
has been aptly nicknamed a school of assassins.

For every year of the last decade, a non-prof-
it organization known as SOA Watch has orga-
nized a nonviolent vigil/protest to commemorate
the killings of the Jesuits in El Salvador. When the
protests began years ago, there were only a hand-
ful of protesters. This year, there were around
10,000. The protesters were an eclectic group of
people, including, of course, many college stu-
dents but also nuns, priests, Buddhist monks and
veterans. There were young children and infants
there, as well as people who were clearly in their
60s or 70s.

Most of the other Pitt students and I had
made the decision to cross the line; that is, we
would be protesting on the actual  base
itself rather than just outside the gate, risking
arrest, ﬁnes and possibly even jail time. Although

I knew that arrest was technically‘ a possibility, it
wasn’t a threat that I took very seriously, knowing
that, for the last two years, most of the protesters
who crossed the line were merely loaded onto
buses and shipped a mile or two away from the
base.

This year, according to SOA Watch, of the
approximately 10,000 protesters, 3,600 crossed
the line and 2,100 were arrested.

" Apparently, the Army grew
tired of giving the protesters just
a slap on the wrist. After we
crossed the line, we were

the road. We were informed of
our options. Those who chose to turn around and

walk out the way they came were free to go. ’

Those who decided to stay would have to get on
a bus and would be taken to the processing cen-
ter. Most of our group chose to get on a bus.

In one of the most unforgettable experiences
of my life, I was processed After waiting on the
bus, and then in a tent for about seven hours, our
group was led into an airplane hangar that had
been set up to process the protesters. First, I was
checked to make sure I wasn’t carrying any
weapons. Then I was photographed, ﬁngerprint-
ed and asked to present identiﬁcation. My name,
address and Social Security number were entered
into a computer. I was given’ a letter explaining
that I had been apprehended for criminal trespass,

and if I was found on Fort Benning any time‘
- within the next ﬁve, years, I would be subject to a

ﬁne of $5,000 or six months in jail or both.
In the past, some SOA protesters served time
in jail. But many of the SOA graduates responsi-

ble for assassinations and massacres have not

been punished. Americans should not let their
government get away with this kind of hypocrisy.

So that was my weekend. I understand that
you’re going to be mad at me for being arrested,

Third parties to blame for election debacle

There’s a very good reason why
America has a two-party system, and in this

- election Green Party presidential candidate

Ralph Nader reinforced it. As it stands now,
Texas governor and Republican presiden-
tial candidate George W. Bush won
Florida’s popular vote by a margin of less
than 550 votes. Nader received 96,837
votes in Florida, the majority of which

- would have otherwise gone to vice presi-
dent and Democratic presidential candidate

Al Gore. , _
Had as little as 1 percent of Nader’s
votes gone to Gore, the entire Florida deba-
cle could have been avoided. We would not
have to wony about recounts and dimpled

' chads, and certainly we wo111d not have had

Cuban dictators offering to help election
officials. Instead, the American people are
left with no clear mandate,‘ no true repre-
sentation of the will of the electorate and no

0 candidate with any remaining dignity.

Nor can Nader claim any success. By
both falling far short of the 5 percent of the
vote needed to secure federal funding for
the Green Party in the next election and
.causing the loss of the candidatewhose ide-

ology is closer to his own, Nader has. dam-
aged his causes, the Green Party and his
own otherwise sterling reputation. The most
curious part is that Nader even thought that
his participation in the election could be
anything but detrimental to his causes.

While many people complain about the
twcrparty system, third-parry
candidates only serve as effec-
tive reminders of why there are
only two major political par-
ties. .

Even when they are as
popular and respected as Nader is, major
third-party candidates who participate in
elections only hurt their own careers and
agendas by stripping votes from the
Reprﬂalican or Democratic candidate they
more closely resemble. History has proved

' this repeatedly. As with Nader, Theodore

Roosevelt and Ross Perot are prime exam-
ples of third—party candidates who have tor-
pedoed their political careers and agendas
by participating in close elections.

When Roosevelt, who, like Nader, was
an enviromnental advocate and opponent of
big business, formed the Progressive (Bull

M. DEEK
CARE

 

Moose) Party in 1912 in order to run against
Republican President William Taft, the ide-
ological rift between conservative and pro-
gressive Republicans became physical.
VV1th the Republican vote split between Taft
and Roosevelt, Woodrow \Vrlson, the
Democratic candidate, easily won the pres-

idency with 435 electoral
. votes.

As a third-party candi-
date, Roosevelt almost directly
caused the defeat of the politi-

' cal party that originally deliv-
ered him into the White House.

Unlike many third-party candidates,
Ross Perot had a good chance at becoming

the president in 1992. A Texas billionaire.

who used his charisma with great effect in
extended TV ads, Perot at one early point in
the campaign showed leads in the polls in
states such as California, New York, Florida
and Ohio. However, after shaking voter
conﬁdence by temporarily dropping out of
the presidential race before “triumphantly”
returning in the latter months of the cam-
paign, Perot’s chances of actually winning
the election were lost.

Though he collected an impressive l9
percent of the national vote, it was collected
mostly from conservative voters who
would have otherwise voted for George
Bush Sr. Eight years and two Clinton terms
later, Perot is a non-entity in politics, and his
Reform Party has become a crippled party
that, under Pat Buchanan’s “leadership,”
has becorrre synonymous with bigotry and
homophobia.

~While Perot gained an interesting chap-
ter for his biography and Roosevelt took
comfort in the fact that W'1lson’s ideologies
eventually came to resemble his own,
Nader came away from elecﬁon 2000 with
nothing — no“5 percent of the vote and no
advancement of his issues. By causing the
election to be settled by lawsuits and tech-
nicalities rather than the will of the people,
Nader caused more than just Gore and the
Democrats to lose.

Rather, the American people, now
stuck with a minority-elected candidate, are
suffering the truest loss.

M. Derek Care got conﬁtsed and acciden-

tally voted for Pat Buchanan.

Media ﬁgures, historians, lawyers and
politicians have unanimously come to the

_ conclusion that the 2000 election is nothing '

less than one of the most unique and his-
toric events in our nation’s history.

But this is perhaps the only consensus
you’ll ﬁnd concerning the issue. In fact,
you can’t even pin down Republicans or
Democrats on a single position day to day
as the complexity of the "race increases with
each hour that passes. Even with the elec-
tion certiﬁed by ‘Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris Sunday evening, declar-
ing Bush the winner of the state’s 25 elec-
toral votes, few are willing to predict any
type of closure on the issue — at least until
the U.S. Supreme Court hears George W.
Bush’s appeal on Friday or until Al Gore’s
protest of the election runs its course. J

Both candidates and their surrogates
have been doing everything in their power

to gain the upper hand in what is nothing -

less than a contest for the most powerful
man in the world. VV1th this in mind, it
should come as no surprise to anyone the
lengths to which the candidates and their
allies will go, and have gone, to acquire
that power. ‘ ‘
The hypocrisy, slander and possible
fraud committed by both parties in this
election, not the obvious ideological divi-
sion in America, is weakening our faith in
the rule of law, our reputation intemation-
ally and hence our national identity.
Neither candidate has acted in our coun-

try’s best interest, a claim both make‘
against each other directly or indirectly on
a daily basis. _ ‘_

Bush, our apparent president-elect, has
done little to earn the respect of the major-
ity of Americans who didn’t vote for him.
In fact, it is now apparent that the Bush
team had been prepared to ‘ go to the
Supreme Court to challenge the

recounts in Florida since two JEFF
MURRAY

days after the election Nov. 7
election. This is quite an odd
plan for the anti-federalist
Republican Party, normally

quick to defend-the rights of states to con-

trol their own laws, courts and elections.‘
Republican criticisms of the Florida
Supreme Court justices as being partisan
undermines in the rule of law they suppos-
edly wish to uphold. Judges, especially
those few who become justices on the
state’s Supreme Court, do so because of
their reputation of putting politics aside
when deciding on matters of law. In
Florida, the governor appoints them from a

list of candidates chosen by a nonpartisan-

commission. Disagreeing with their deci-
sion is expected, but attacking ﬂre integrity
of the court because of an unfavorable
decision is slanderous and a dangerous
precedent to set, especially after Bush ran a
campaign that promised to end the use of
smear tactics so often employed by the
Clinton administration.

A second hypocrisy on the part of the

  

ST.-\FF WRm«:R

Republicans is found in their push to
include absentee ballots that were received
after Election Day and yet were not post-

’marked. The law in Florida states quite

clearly that absentee ballots received after
Election Day must be postmarked. Enacted
in response to rampant voter fraud in Dade
County and elsewhere during past elec-
tions, this law prevents votes
from being cast after
Election Day. Whereas the
law in Florida is quite clear
lconceming ﬂre rejection of
the late ballots, it is not ‘near-
1y as clear concerning the acceptance of

a hanging or -dimpled chads on punch card
. ballots in Florida.

In effect, Bush and the Republicans '

swish to include illegal ballots while

excluding legal but questionable ones, and
claim to be justiﬁed because the absentee
votes come largely from the  I
hope these types of double standards will
not be endemic of a Bush administration,
but I fear that we are headed back to the
days of moral relevancy ‘prevalent during
the Reagan administration. ,
Congratulations Mr. President-elect,

‘ you’ve managed to become the worst of

both Clinton and Reagan before you’ve

even taken ofﬁce.

, Gore, while trying to take the high
moral ground on the issue that every vote
should count, still fails to escape the chains
of hypocritical rhetoric. After praising the

The hypocrisy of the Republicrats in Florida

canvassing boards in Miarni—Dade, Palm
Beach and Broward counties for their'ini-
tiatives in recounting votes, he quickly
ﬁled suit against Miarni-Dade for ending
its recountafter a unanimous board deci-
sion to do so by members of his own party.

When it became clear that absentee
votes that were disqualiﬁed for lack of a
postmark mainly came from military over-

seas, Al Gore and his surrogates made a0

concerted effort to publicly ask that those
votes be reconsidered. In the counting
rooms, however, Democrat observers and
lawyers rrrade every effort to challenge the
same ballots.

It is possible that, if the U.S. Supreme
Court overturns the decision of the Florida
Supreme Court, we’ll ﬁnd ourselves
watching Gore and company criticizing the
“conservative justices” for overstepping
their authority and changing the decision of
the state court.

The patent hypocrisy of Gore and
Bush in rhetoric and deed and the apparent
role reversals on the issue of federalism vs.
states’ rights by the Democrats and the
Republicans illustrate that ideologies and
principles are not as important as the acqui-
sition of power.

Final Score: Republicrats 2, America
0.

Jeﬁ Murray hopes that this election ﬁnally

shows that the Republicans and
Democrats are just about power, not ideas.

INTER FASHION

 

his winter, as temperatures drop, snow falls
and wind whips through the city, you will find
yourself in a very important relationship. It
will be soft, warm and fuzzy. There .won’t be

_ eroticism, but there will be fashion. This
smoking affair will be with your coat.

A quality coat is an investment — like a relationship,
it is any investment in warmth and in emotion. After all,
when you have to throw on the same outerwear day after
cold snowy day, it’s important that you feel comfortable
in the way it fits and looks.

.My favorite coat of all time was a one I had in fifth
grade. It was a red wool pea coat-with black wooden tog-
gles and a red hood. Of all the cold-weather garments
I’ve owned, I had the best relationship with that coat. We
went everywhere together — ice skating, ‘the mall,
school. I didn’t even feel so dorky when my mom made
me wear my snow boots to school and no one else did —
I didn’t care how cold the weather got or how silly my
fifth-grade clothes looked underneath my red wooly
friend. I felt cool —‘—— so cool in fact, I even wanted to
wear the jacket into spring. Sadly, I outgrew my coat, and
my mom donated it to ‘Goodwill. -

The lesson here is to treat your coat well, and it will
last you as longsas you don’t grow out of it, a rule of
thumb to keep in mind when dealing with significant oth-
ers, as well. Sometimes, however, you do outgrow your
coat, and then what do you look for?

ichard Parsakian, owner of Eons in Shadyside,

helped to explain what people over the last"

century have looked for when choosing a coat.
Parsakian first pulled out an evening coat
from the 19105, the earliest coat in his collec-

tion. Long and gray, the coat had large lapels and cuffs,
_ which he guessed were probably gmadeof curly lamb. fur. .

An intricate swath._of embroidery decorated thefront and

Coats’ from the 1910s and 1920s featuredldrop waists.
Fashion from the ‘20s was heavily inﬂuenced by the Art

Deco movement and ﬂapper style. Women wore long,
lean clothes, which necessitated. equally long and elegant

- C0318.

The coats at this time often featured long lapels and
large cuffs with excessive details such as buttons, puffs,
slits and folds in the fabric, as well as embroidery.

“I never see those things in real life,” Parsakian said
of the elusive accessories, standard with these early—cen-
tury models. ,

Most of the coats he finds are from the ‘40s, ‘50s and
‘60s. He explained that coats, especially those made of
natural fibers like wool, don’t last for years and years
unless they’ve been_well caredffor.

Coats of the 1930s mimicked styles of the ‘20s. They

too were long but had slightly higher waists and were ’

more fitted. Fur trim was also popular during that time

period. Also, Coco, Chanel popularized women’s pea‘

coats; previously only sailors wore them.

In the 1940s, the coats reﬂected war times. Simple
and slim, ‘often with accentuated shoulders, these coats
resounded with practicality. Parsakian described coats
from the ‘60s as “boxy,” coats from the ‘50s as “fitted”
and coats from the ‘40,s as ‘.‘somewhere in between.”

‘At the end of the decade, however, Christian Dior

introduced his “New Look,” which played off of the

boom» -in the economy that resulted after World War II.
This‘i'cur7V_—y,§ fi_tted,5. feminine silhouette ushered in the

. 1950s."Diessies or this time emphasized a round, hour-

glass figure,\and the coats mimicked this model.

“Alfew seasons back, the ‘50s swing coat made a big
resurgence,” Parsakian said. .

The 1960s contrasted with the 1950s curvy shape.
Boxy coats that looked as if they belonged with a suit
became popular. Coats from «this decade also sported a
much shorter hemline than previous coats. Parsakian

brought up the interesting fact that women’ often kept _

their coats from year to year, but shortened the hemlines
to keep up-with changing fashions. He explained that this
trend often makes it difficult to find vintage coats in their
original lengths. (Continued page 14)

Coats of the 1970s arrived in fur, animal print or

The 1980s have been touted as fashionable again
by high fashion magazines, but Parsakian commented

. that he doesn’t believe ‘80s—inspired fashions are truly

popular yet. , _ .
He said, though, that when he thinks of the ‘_80s, he

thinks of new wave and punk movements, the power

suit and anything that. . V

brings to mind “Dynasty.”
Parsakian described the

‘80s as “bringing back the’

way.” Oversized wrap coats
with little detail were popu-
lar at that time.

All of these trends,
however, describe women’s
fashions. While men’s ‘
clothing has changed along
with women’s, their coats -
have not.

Men’s coats, interest-
ingly enough, changed very
little over the course of the
century. Parsakian said that

“Quilters” L
Henry Heymann Theatre

Nov. 30 - Dec. 10
624—PLAY

ilrilrilrilr
' JENNIFER MECCARIELLO

Arts & Entertainment Editor

Dizzyingly non-linear, yet comfortingly full ,

circle, “Quilters,” Pittsburgh Repertory Theatre’s
newest show, follows the prairie life cyc_le of
Sarah (Linda Hunt Taylor) and her six daughters
(Rebecca L. Shick, Mary Kate Urbanski, Elena-
Maria Passarello, Bronwyn L. Steinberg, Sara
Jane Wolff and Beth Hersey).

“Quilters” is Molly Newman and Barbara
Damashek’s musical adaptation of Patricia
Cooper and Norma Bradley Al1en’s historical fic-
tion book, “Quilters: Women and Domestic Art.”
The original book was based on oral histories,

, weaving many pioneer women’s experiences into

one family’s story of wagon trains, dugout
homes, freezing winters and breezy summers, all
blended together into a patchwork that reflects
many lives.

The singing is outstanding, with each actress
trilling through her lines beautifully, harmoniz-
ing perfectly. Passarello’s deep voice compli-
ments the more traditional sopranos of the other
women, while Taylor’s booming narration mills

them all to a fine sawdust.

The Henry Heymann Theatre becomes many
different sets with the simple addition of a stool
or piece of fabric.

Scott Lee DeNier directs to perfection as the
cast moves through the prairie to a riverside bap-
tism to a home childbirth, the screams of which
gave me chills. There is no run crew on this pro-
duction — instead each actress brings out her
own props, all keeping in perfect tune.

And just to whet your whistle with this whole
quilting thing, the Heymann is transformed into a
museum of sorts a half-hour before each perfor-

for a number of fouls.

When the clock read 0:00 at the
A.J. ‘Palumbo Center last night, the
Pitt women’s basketball team lost
its second game of the season. But it
was not necessarily the opponent
that caused the defeat,
women’s basketball team itself.

The Panthers fell to cross-town
rival Duquesne, 67-59, in a matchup
tainted with turnovers, sloppy shots

“I don’t. think we were ready at
all. We were ﬂat,” said head coach
Traci Waites. “It was by far our
worst game of the season.”

The Panthers never really had
control in the first half, falling
behind early on and constantly try-
ing to play catch-up. The Dukes
went up by as many as 11 by using
long passes to find players wide
open. The Pitt offense could not get
on track, as it had passes intercept-
ed and errant shots, and was called

Both teams were aggressive, as

for possession and knocking away
passes. But despite 12 points in the

first half from Mandy Wittenmyer, ‘

the Panthers entered halftime trail-
ing the Dukes 40-29.

“We shot the ball terrible and we
have to work on passing,” Waites
said. “We had inconsistent play
from both our starters and our
bench. I’m not taking anything
away from Duquesne, b_ut__we have a
lot of work to do.” T

The Dukes opened the scoring in
the second half but the Panthers
began to chip away at the lead. Pitt
then went on a 17-3 run that includ-
ed two three-pointers by Laine
Selwyn to take a 48-47 lead with
11:30 left in the game. The lead
changed hands over the next few
minutes before a basket, as the shot
clock expired, by Duquesne’s Shiri
Sharon gave the Dukes the perma-
nent lead.

Duquesne went to the free-throw
line six times in the final two min-
utes to hold onto its lead and pre-

Though they won their last three games, the
Pitt_'men’s basketball team learned some invalu-
able lessons. A

The Panthers learned that they are capable of
taking advantage of their talented players in their
74-53 trouncing of Morris Brown Nov. 20.

3 They learned that underdogs, no matter how
under they are, should never be overlooked, a les-
son evident in their dramatic 71-69 overtime vic-
tory against the Mjarist Red Foxes last Friday. The
game fell to the Panthers in the last three seconds
of play.

And finally, Pitt learned that it has not over-
come its inabilitylon the foul line, where it con-
tinued to struggle, though the Panthers beat St.
Francis 70-52 last night. The win over the Red
Flash moved Pitt to 4-0 on the season. The

What happened to  
the Boston Celtics?

New England is rich with histo-
ry and heritage. From the American

‘Revolution and the Treaty of

Portsmouth to the Curse of the
Bambino and the NHL’s “original
six”, the northeastern states are full
oftradition, and none is greater
than ‘Celtic Pride.

From Bob Cousy, Bill Russell
and K.C. Jones to Larry Bird, Kevin
McHa1e and Dennis Johnson, the
Boston Celtics have been synony-

mous with dynasty. A
dynasty that won 11-  H

Unfortunately, all dynas- ‘ ’
pened to the Romanovs and
the Plantagenets.” And the
Canadiens and 49ers, too.

It has happened to the
Celtics. The once storied
franchise has suffered
seven straight losing sea-
sons. They »haven’t won
a playoff game in five
years, and they haven’t -
advanced past the first round. in
nine years. _ * -

How does an organization that
witnessed so much success for more
than 41) years fall apart? Is it bad
management or just bad luck? Or is
it both? , A I

Ite-‘appears that the downfall of
the Celtic dynasty started with a lit-
tle bad luck after‘ their last NBA
championship in 1986.

That summer, they drafted Len
Bias with the second pick in the
draft. .

Bias was to be the cornerstone
of the franchise, just like Russell
and Bird. Instead, he died two days
after the draft from a drug over-
dose.

In 1992, Bird’ retired because of
back problems, after only 13 sea-
sons in the league. The following
season, tragedy struck the Celtics,

7 ‘ again. During a pick-up game in the

off-season, team captain Reggie
Lewis collapsed and died from a
heart ailment.

Then came one of the most
mind—boggling moves ever ——- the
appointment of M.L. Carr as gener-
al manager. With Carr at the con-
trols, the Celtics had fourof their

. WOl'St seasons CV61’.

His first big moves were sign-
ing Dominique Wilkins and Pervis
Ellison. Both acquisitions would
have been great had they happened
five years earlier, when both play-
ers were in their prime.

 
 
  
  
   
  
 

Wilkins played two seasons for
the Celtics, then _scampered off to
Europe. Ellison remained with the
“team until last year, spending most
of the time on injured reserve with
two bad knees. .

After the 1994-95 season, Carr
made his worst move. He fired
coach Chris Ford, even though the
Celtics made the playoffs (despite
another losing record), and named
himself the new coach. As'unbe~

 lievable as it was, Carr
the coach was even
worse than Carr the gen-
eral manager.

with drafting two of the
biggest busts’ in Celtic his-
tory: those of Eric Montross
in 1995 and Eric Williams
in 1996. Both players
were traded a year after
being drafted for next to
nothing.

Carr also j drafted

J""’3' Nlarcmlﬂla Antoine Walker in 1997.

Walker was fantastic as a
rookie, but hasn’t done much since
except disappoint. He arrived to
camp late and overweightafter the
lockout in 1999.

The spring of -1997 saw the
beginning of the Rick Pitino era.
Pitino took complete, control of a
team that had suffered its worst sea-
son ever. 1 -

The Celtics were 15-67 in 1996-
97, llostiTim Duncan -in the draft
(more bad luck) and ended up with
two players (Ron Mercer and
Chauncey Billups) who were both
gone by the end of the 1999 season.

Pitino has tried to get the
Celtics on the right track.

Drafting Paul Pierce .in 1998
was a big help. But. bad luck struck
again last summer when Pierce was
stabbed in the face, neck and back
at a Boston night club.

Pitino gave the players an ulti-
matum this year" ——- “Win or I’m
outta here.” Who can blame him?
There is no room under the salary
cap to try to sign any good players,
and with so many kids leaving col-
lege early, it’s even harder to tell
who will succeed. With no light at
the end of the tunnel, the Celtics
need a miracle worker or the rein-
carnation of John Havlicek to get
them back on track.

Joey Marchilena is a columnist for
The Pitt News, and he could’ve
coached the Celtics to a better
record than M.L. Carr did.’

not enough to propel Pitt past the
Dukes. ’

‘,‘We had ups and downs, it was a
roller coaster,” Wittenmyer said.
“We got the down. Our shots didn’t
fall, and you can’t force that. It was
tough luck.”

Wittenmyer recorded her third
double-double of the season by
putting up 20 points and 14
rebounds. Bettina Lovewas the only
other Panther to hit double digits
with 11 points, but also added seven
turnovers. —

night, Waites offered no excuses.

“Duquesne played very well,
which was evident. They never
quit”,=” Waites said. “Every game is a
learning experience, but it’s forgot-
ten. It’s‘ over.”

The Panthers will try for a win-
ning recordonce again as they trav-
el to take on Ohio on Saturday.

Kent State 77, Pitt 67 (OT)

The Panthers suffered their first
defeat of the season Saturday after-
noon at Kent State, falling in over-

time 77-67. Pitt played hard early,
b but let a double—digit lead fade away

as the Golden Flashes forced over-

' time and eventually capture the Vic-

tory. . -
The Panthers started the game
with a 19-6 run before taking their
largest lead of the game, -17 points,
at the 4:06 mark. Pitt entered half-
time with a 33-21 lead and still led
by 12 at 13:02 of the second half.

The Golden Flashes then went on a.

13-2 run to pull within one, 48-47,
with just over eight minutes left.
Kent State’s Lori Krezeczowski
then hit a three-pointer with 45 sec-
onds left to give the Golden Flashes
their first lead of the game.

Pitt answered and regained the
lead on a three-pointer from
Selwyn, but Krezeczowski hit two
free throws in the final seconds to
tie the game at 65. Kent State then
dominated the five-minute over-
time, taking advantage of the fact
that three Pitt starters were on the
bench because of five personal
fouls. The Golden Flashes outscored
the Panthers 12-2 to secure the 77-
67 win.

Selwyn led the Panthers with 16
points and Love and Monique Toney
each added 11. Wittenmyer led all
players with 11 rebounds.

Pitt 81, Robert Morris 49

The Panthers soundly defeated
Robert Morris ‘ 81-49 last
Wednesday at Fitzgerald Field
House behind strong performances
from Toney,
Celeste Barkley. .

Toney recorded a game-high 19
points and was perfect from the
field, hitting all sixshots, including
two from behind the arc. She was
also a perfect five of five from the
free-throw line and added seven
assists ‘and two rebounds.

“Monique had an impressive
game,” Waites said. “It does not ‘get
any better than that.”

Wittenmyer picked up her sec-
ond double-double of the season by

putting up a season—high 16 points V

and 11 rebounds, while Barkley
recorded the first double-double of
her careerwith a career-high 15
pointsand 11 rebounds.

Defense was also critical as the
Panthers forced 29 turnovers and
seven different players recorded
steals, led by Jackie Campbell with
three. Pitt committed" just 11
turnovers, the fewest in a game in
recent history.

Pitt took a commanding 20-4
lead within the first nine minutes of
play and during that time held the
Colonials tojust one three-pointer

and one free throw. The Panthers ,
went up by asmany as 18 and held a '

42-25 halftime lead.

Pitt continued to dominate in the
second half, going on a 12-5 run and
easily capturing the 81-49 victory.

0nd half and made 65 percent of
their shots overall.

Senior Ricardo Greer led the
Panthers with 18 points and eight
rebounds. Junior center Chris
Seabrooks also had an impressive
game, finishing with 11 p_oints.

But St. Francis’ squad was the
first team this season to control for-

points and had four rebounds in 24
minutes of action. ’ ~

Pitt 71, Marist 69

Three  Marist forward Matt
Tullis erroneously throws his
inbound pass right into the body of
the leaping Hawkins. ‘

Two  Hawkins collects the ball
off the ground and makes eye con-
tact with Greer, who darts toward the
net. Hawkins dishes it off.

One  Greer fakes a shot, drib-
bles once and releases a successful
layup an instant before the buzzer
sounds. '

“A thousand one, a thousand

two, a thousand three -— it’s an eter—-

nity,” Pitt head coach Ben Howland
said of the longest three seconds of
the Panthers’ short season.

Greer’s overtime basket assured
the Panthers a narrow victory
against a team they were expected to

handle easily.

“We were lucky to get a win
tonight,” Howland said after the
game, in what is the season’s biggest
understatement.

Even Greer recognized that his
team had some good fortune. When
asked whether or not he thought he
could make the final basket in time,
he quickly said, “No.”

The Panthers were never domi-
nant, and in fact trailed the Red
Foxes for most of the game.

Much of what confounded Pitt’s

‘effort was its poor shooting. Pitt

went two of 16 behind‘ the three-
point line and was successful in only

.13 of its 28 free throw attempts.

“We’re going to just have to
spend more and more time working
on our foul shooting,” Howland said.

“We practice so much foul shots,

-it’s just that they weren’t falling

today,’7 said Greer, who went five of

~ 10 from .the foul line.

Marist took advantage of Pitt’s
mistakes, 'out—hustling the Panthers
for much of the game. ~

Forward Drew Samuels led the
team with 24 points and 14 rebounds
and junior guard Sean Kennedy
scored 15 points and had Panther
players chasing him around the court
throughout the game.

“It was incredible how hard they

played,” Greer said.

“We have a lot of guys from New
York, you know, tough guys,”

,Kennedy said, explaining how his

team kept the score so close. “So
we’re not intimidated by anybody.”

The Panthers came back from a
57-50 deficit with five minutes left
in regulation on the strength‘ of six
points from Brandin Knight and tied
the game.

The Panthers held the lead for
most of the overtime period, and the
game was tied at 66 late in the peri-
od. ‘

Chad Johnson, who won
Howland’s praise for his strong
defense at the end of the game, made
a clutch offensive play by draining a
three—point shot. But Kennedy

matched Johnson’s effort, hitting a

three—pointer with 42 seconds
remaining.
Marist let the clock run down to
13 seconds before trying its last
play, but Kennedy missed a three-
pointer, and Pitt tipped the ball out
of bounds in just to the left side of
their basket. From there, with three
points left, Hawkins and Greer lifted

the Panthers to an emotional victory.

Pitt 74, Morris Brown 53

Seniors Greer and Hawkins led
the way to their second decisive vic-
tory in as many. games as Pitt defeat-
ed Morris Brown, 74-53‘,

The two Panther forwards each
had their first double-doubleof the
season. Greer posted 13 points and
10. rebounds, and Hawkins finished
with 14 and 11.

“Our two seniors stepped up and
played how you’re supposed to
play,” Howland said.

While Pitt easily handled most
of its physical opponents, it was not

able to contain either sophomore‘

forward Hicks, who had 19 rebounds
and 16 points, or junior guard
Anthony Adams, who also scored

16. j

1 “They had some very good ath— I
letes,” Hawkins said of the
Wolverines.

“No. 42 (Adams) was getting
every rebound out there,”,Greer
said, noting also that “they were
kind "of small.” '

‘Morris Brown is in its first year‘

of play in Division I.

Pitt started the game strong, giv—‘

ing up the opening basket and then
scoring the next 12 points in three
minutes.

— After that, Pitt never lost the

lead, and by halftime, the Panthers
‘had a 34-20 edge. A ’
“Our defense in the first half was

good,” Howland said. But he criti-
cized his offense for not being
patient enough.

“We tried to go for the home run
a little too much,” he said.

“The second half saw the
Panthers go up by as much as 24
points, and, the Panthers easily
cruised to victory.

“We played solid,” Hawkins
said.
