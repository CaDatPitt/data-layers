TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1974

BY RITA VITOL0

Money to rescue Lawrenceville’s
beleagured Arsenal Family and
Children's.Center from the finan-
cial crisis threatening its survival is
currently being sought outside the
legislative process by Pitt ofﬁcials
in Harrisburg.

The Chancellor has already
committed the University to con-
tinued faculty support of the center
provided outside funding can be
located.

The University is scheduled for
negotiations Wednesday with
Shapp Cabinet appointee Secreatry
of Administration Frank Beal,
seeking “permanent--short term
and long range--funding of Ar-
serial", according to Pitt's Director
of Governmental Relations Russell
M. Arnold. “What we're looking
for,"‘he said, “is money to cover
th-is year, next year, and some kind
of permanent funding."

The possibility of finding such
funding in Harrisburg is good.
Arnold claimed, estimating it's

chances at “better than ﬁfty-ﬁfty." _

“The money would not come as a
line item in Pitt’s budget,” Arnold
said, “because such items are in
the long run harder to get, but
would come as a special appropria-
tion specifically earmarked for
Arsenal.”

Funding for Arsenal is possible
from two sources, claimed Chan-
cellor Assistant for Academic
Affairs David R. Powers. both
through legislative action and
through the appeal to Secretary
Beal, but said the University is
concentrating its efforts on ﬁnding
a temporary source that could with
time assume ﬁnancial responsibi-

_ bity for Arsenal. ‘
Maintaining that Pitt is commit-

ted to ﬁnding permanent funding

for Arsenal. Powers speculated:
that one source of temporary
funding under investigation is in
the possible release of federal
revenue sharing monies controled
by the Harrisburg executive.

Powers said one source of
temporary funding under investi-
gation is the possible release of
federal revenue-sharing monies the
Harrisburg executive branch con-
trols. _
Any money allocated to Arsenal at
this time comes in addition to Pitt’s
already funded $51 million budget,
Powers said.

State _House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Eugene
Scanlon said Monday Arnold had
asked him two days prior to the
May primary to “hold off on
ﬁnding ﬁnancing for Arsenal."
State Senator Frank Mazzei con-
ﬁrmed the -legislative push to seek
funding for Arsenal was waiting for
the outcome of Arnold's and
Vice-Chancellor for Planning and
Budget‘s Jack Freeman's talks
with Beal.

Scanlon, Maz/zei. and a team of
Harrisburg legislators had been
investigating possible funding al-
ternatives for Arsenal since late
April. sparked by local citizen
protest against Pitt's decision to
close the facility. spearheaded by
the Centerfs Mother's Club Chair-
woman "Patricia Dean.

Mazzei said he would push for
permanent funding for the Center
to protect the investment of the

Arsenal community. “If you look"

for short range funding now, the
people involved will say, legislators
alike,".‘we’ve got this ‘thing half
dead already, let’s finish it off.’
"The best way to fund Arsenal
would have to be an appropriation
to the University specifically

earmarked for that Center.‘

Both Scanlon and Mozzei agreed
nevertheless to bide the Univer-
sity's time as it seeks funding for
Arsenal on its own.

Arnold said his reason for asking
Scanlon to ease his legislative push
for Arsenal funding was very
simple. “Our chances of getting
the money are better with Beele.”
He did not rule out the possibility
of a co-ordinated University and
legislative effort in the future.

Arsenal Center needs approxi-
mately $40,000 to cover its
operating expenses for next year,
including temporarily on some
funds left over from its former
foundation support. The Center’s
projected operating budget for one
year is $100,000.

No ofﬁcial word on the status of
the investigations in Harrisburg
has been leaked to Arsenal,

his home at 5909 Alder Street by
the Pittsburgh Police, Sex and
Youth Division.

The "suspect is being held in
Allegheny County Jail on $50,000
bail. A preliminary hearing is set
before a City
magistrate.

Aside from the seven counts of
rape, Miller has been charged with
nine counts of burglary, four counts
of sodomy. three counts.of indecent
assault, three counts of aggravated
assault and battery, three counts of
simple assault, and one count of
criminal trespassing.

According to news reports last
March, the Oakland rapist attacked
his victims in their own bedrooms
early in the morning after
apparently prying windows to gain
entry. A police spokesman, while
admitting at least one of the rapes
Miller is charged with occurred in
this manner, declined comment on

this and many other issues for fear ,

of damaging the prosecution. '
Asked why it took over eight
months to apprehend Miller,
Sargent John Flannigan, one of the
arresting ofﬁcers, said because
many victims were attacked at
night, some during their sleep,
many potential witnesses were
unable to identifysthe suspect.

Scheduled for installation some-
time in early fall, the rails are

“These new rails will cut down
somewhat on the wear and tear on

This is

Some rails presently in use in the
area are dated as early as'l929.

Henderson said the railroad
plans no special high-speed trafﬁc
over the new _rails. although the
welded continuous rails are used

for high-speed passenger traffic by r

some railioad companies. The
longer rail means fewer joints
between “rails and correspondingly
less noise and bouncing, particu-
larly advantageous for passenger
traffic.

The new rail costs about the
same as the older 30-foot rail
sections, accordingto Henderson,
because more joint places are
needed for the shorter rails, and
shorter rails cause more wear on
rolling stock.

Colson

WASHINGTON AP--Charles W.
Colson, saying he wants to tell the
full Watergate story, pleaded
guilty Monday to obstructing
justice. In return, he won
agreement that he will no longer be
prosecuted for the Watergate
cover-up or plumbers’ cases.

The former special counsel to

'President Nixon said he hadn’t
been able to testify fully because he
was under indictment in the two
cases.

“To have ‘fought the two
‘indictments might well have
resulted in\ my eventual exonera-
tion," he said. “As a defendant, 1
would have been necessarily
concerned _with protecting ,my
position in the trials. That would
have limited my ability to tell
everything I know, about the
Watergate and Watergate-related
matters."

Colson pleaded guilty to a newly
drawn charge: that in 1971 he
concocted and carried out a scheme
to “defame and destroy the public
image and credibility" "of Daniel
Ellsberg and his "attorney, then
nearing trial in the Pentagon
Papers case.

The 42-year-old Colson, a lawyer
who now faces disbarment, will be
sentenced June 21 by US District
‘Jedge Gerhard A. Gesell. The

 maximum penalty on the felony
V charge is ﬁve years in prison and a

$5,000 ﬁne.

Dismissal of three previously-
leveled charges, which could have
brought a maximum sentence of 20
years in prison and $20,000 in
fines, is just a formality awaiting
separate court proceedings.

Colson was one of ﬁve defend-
ants in the White House plumbers
case, each charged with conspiring
to violate the rights of Dr. Lewis
Fielding,°Ell-sberg's psychiatrist, in
the break-iii of Fielding’s ofﬁce. 4

“I think when it’s.all over, we’re

“We're trying to get away from
the confusion that existed before,
and come up with a more
constructive approach to security
that would best serve the Univer-
sity." ' ‘

Fadzen reported -the commission
has interviewed more than 50
persons, individually and as a
group. including faculty, students
and police officers.

“I don’t know if the report has
been delayed all that much,”
Fadzen said. “Some things, like
going through records and statis-
tics, take a lot more time than you
would ever have anticipated.

“Now it's just a matter of putting

Brevard said he was reluctant to

said 25 years of experience as a

thinking led him in that direction.

The unusual size of the deposit in
the safe was because ’ of the

Department of Theatre Arts’ Mime

Until nine months ago the Leona
Theatre in Homestead -was a run
down. empty building, an iEast
Eighth Avenue eyesore. Today the
building has undergone a facelift-

ing through the efforts of Fresh_

Energies.. a dynamic new theatre
group. .

Fresh Energies was formed
about nine ‘months ago by Rick
Fleischauer and a group of friends
who all had the same idea of what
“theatre" should be. “We want

-this theatre to be a place for people

to come and have a good time,"
said Rick Fleischauer. I “But we
don't want it to be only for the elite
who can afford it which is what
most theatres are like. We are
going to charge prices which the
average man can afford." ‘

The originators of the ‘theatre
group literally sold everything they
had to buy the building and
renovate the theatre, investing
money and hours of work.

All the members of Fresh
Energies are volunteers, some
time and others
helping whenever possible. _ “We
consider our work an investment,"
said Felischauer, “since
it'll pay off if the theatre is a
success."

The owners of Fresh Energies
hope to iise the theatre for all
artistic endeavors - from musical
plays. to ballets, to jazz concerts.

What Programming?

The Student Government Programming Committee policy of
centralizing programming responsibilities within the committee is an
inhibition of a student organization’s right to program and also
deprives Pitt students of a varied and qualitative schedule of programs.
' In the General Rationale of the Programming Committee submitted
to the Allocations Committee along with its budget for the ﬁscal year

I 7 -'74-’75, the Prograrnrriing Committee concluded there was a “general

movement toward the diffusion of programming responsibilities.” The
committee questioned this movement “because a decentralized
student activities program lends itself to inefﬁciency and confusion in

- general.”-

Furtherrnore, the Rationale concluded that some organizations did
not have the organizational capacity or the need to program. 4 The
Programming Committee, which has initial jurisdiction over all student
organization programming requested the Allocations Committee to
“use its power” to halt this trend of diffuse programming

» responsibilities by limiting programming funds to student

‘organizations.

'IhepastrecordoftheSGProgrammingCormnittee speaks foritself.
Quite clearly the committee has failed to provide the students with
varied and qualitative programming on any scale this year. Any
movement tow “diffusion” would be a welcome relief to Pitt
programming ~

Individual student organizations with their individual special
interests are rriore capable of providing variety in programming at Pitt.
However, they like the Programming Committee cannot guarantee
quality, yet this is no reason to deny organizations the right and
responsibility to program.

Like last year at this time the Programming Committee’s schedule is

V indeﬁnite, except for two dates. But a. close look at the breakdown

analysis indicates only six lectures are slated for next year to be
sponsored by the Programming Committee. Once again the emphasis
of programming by the committee will be on the rnini-concert and
coffee house circuit which has failed so miserably in the past.

To a certain extent then, Pitt students are depenwdent on
organizations other than Student Government to ﬁll their programming
needs.

For example, when the Black Action Society scheduled Bobby Scale
and Stokely Carmichael to speak, they perhaps sponsored the two most
interesting lectures at Pitt all year. Student Government alone does

not have the authority and responsibility of programming.

The Allocations Committee has not adhered strictly to the
Programming policy when distributing money for programs. Though
the committee should be commended for this, we must address
ourselves to the more serious issue: that the Allocations Committee
cannot judiciously make these decisions on the quality and variety of

_ programming when the Programming Committee, the body which

makes recommendations to the Allocations Committee, is determined
to centralize all programming to keep all programming responsibilities
within its jurisdiction.

We therefore recommend to the Student Government Board, which
is meeting tomorrow night to approve or disapprove the

‘ recommendations of the Allocations Committee on programming, to

thoroughly scrutinize each decision so that an organization's right to
program and provide Pitt ‘students with varied programming is

. respected and adhered to as policy by Student Government.

  Pantherpittdom Revisited,

BY TOM SMITH

Once upon a time in the part of
the world known as Steel there was
a small kingdom called Panther-
pittdom. ruled by the kind and
courteous King Pos de Var..

One lune day the bells of St.
Ketchup's pealed as the villagers
celebrated the conversion of the
once malevolent Sir Joe of
Dumbton.

Sir Joe, the notorious represen-
tative, of the Kingdon of Fees,
mended his evil ways to restore the
confidence of the village’s pea-
sants, referred to in history books
as students [pronounced stew-
dents].

Another group. though, which
lived in the trees of the forest on
the hills overlooking the small
kingdom, were plotting the des-
truction of King Pos and his
subjects. This group of guerilla
ﬁghters was sanctioned by the
nearby village, Athletic City.

The terrorist "group called the
Armed Majors, was led by General
Castor Oilinski. His mission was
the destruction of the national and
most successful ‘sport of Panther-
pittdom. hockey.

Oilinski wanted to replace
hockey with llabtoof, his favorite

sport and the national «sport of the

wealthy village of Athletic City.

The Armed Majors attacked
Pantherpittdom’s hockey teams
daily. They tried to end their
success once and for all by stifling
the tiny village's hockey expansion
program. Most importantly.
though, they stole money from the
teams‘ teasuries-money the hockey
clubs had every right to have.

The students attempted to inform
their rulers of the gloomy situation
But King Pos was too busy
checking the authority of the
converted knight, Dumbton. to
understand the tragedy of hockey
in Pantherpittdom.

So, the students had to take the
matter into their own hands. They
appointed Mik Fury to lead
Pantherpittdom’s guerilla forces to
combat the terrorizing Armed
Majors.

Fury was though to be the ideal
choice because he was the
coordinator of all the student teams
and the captain of the Govern-
nients, poor Pantherpittdom’s
weakest team. He got his name
because of his ability to score
points rapidly‘ or, rather, that is
what Fury thought.

But, the governments ﬁnished in
last place consistently and the team
had not scored a goal all season. In

fact the other members of the club
were so embarrassed they often
failed to appear at the games.

Against all odds Fury and his
group, the Follies, captures Gen-
eral Oilinski. But, they did not
know what to do with him. By this
time the condition of hockey in
Pantherpittdom was at a critical
-point. The teams needed money
desperately, so Fury attempted to
obtain funding from the captured
Oilinski.

“I won't give you a dime," said
the wealthy Oilinski. “I don't like
hockey and I don't want any part of
it. And. oh yeah, I don’t have the
money to give you." An Ollinski
began to sob.

Fury felt sorry for the General
and released him from captivity.
As Oilinski ran from his cell into a
free world and back to the trees in
the hills, he put a hand in his
pocket and pulled out a stack of
bills. called scholarships, which
would have shocked even the
wealthiest of citizensin Panther-
pittdom.

As the sun set behind the trees .

overlooking the tiny village, the
students could ' hear Oilinski’s
bellicose laughter. And the Armed
Majors continued sabotaging hoc-
key in Pantherpittdom.

Though many questions on its speciﬁc nature remain unanswered,
the concept of a center for the University’s childhood oriented
‘programs is a good one which needs to be further studied before its
implementation. The Henderson Committee though should
recommend the establishment of such a center in its report to

’ Chancellor Posvar.

The Henderson Committee has been meeting for more than a
month to study the feasibility of implementing the recommendation of
the Glaser Committee to explore the “nature of a University wide
organization to coordinate, focus, and strengthen Pitt's dispersed
commitment in the area under consideration” (childcare and child
Uevelopment programs.)

Donald Henderson, Associate Provost and chairman‘ of the
Henderson Committee, has indicated the committee will probably
recommend the establishment of the center, but that fimding of a
center could present problems to the University because of the tight
money situation.

The greatest asset of a center is that it would coordinate childcare
and child development programs in such a way as to make Pitt's
involvement in this ﬁeld visible.

In this way, the University’s involvement in‘ youth programs, which
range from Lawrencev_ille’s Arsenal Family and Children's Center to
Falk School and the Hill District’s Terrace Village 11 Health Program,

- ﬁcould; be‘ madeknown to the community.

   
  
   
 

Yet, it is quite clear the exact nature of the center is unknown. Will
it be a “full blown’ ” center in the words of Hendefson or will it merely
be a center “on paper”, which will have as its fimction the publishing
of brochures on childcare and child development? Certainly, a full
blown center designed to coordinate the various prograns while
their individuality and designed  should be the

. ultimate goal of Pitt’s administrators.

Evidently, many questions need to be ariswered. First, is the
primary purpose of the center facilitative or policy making? Second,
who will compose the coordinating body of the center? Will they be
people involved in the’ programs or those who make the budetary
decisions. And thirdly, is the center to seek ﬁnancial assistance for
Pitt’s childcare and child development prograrris form outside the

University or is it to be responsible for distributing the money which is

already available?

Once the committee recommends the center to Posvar and the
Chancellor approves that recommendation, the University can get
down to the hard business of deﬁning and specifying the goals and
functions of the center.

But, theﬁrst step is for Pitt to realize its moral and educational
responsibilities in the ﬁeld of childcare and child development. The
initial establishment of a center as recommended by the Glaser
Committee will indicate that committment. ' ' I

K Divorce

Dear- Editor: .

Domestic law which was originally
designed to protect women is now
serving to penalize men and must
be updated. For example, when
there is a divorce involving
children, it is sexual discrimination
to give the mother preference in
obtaining custody. The morality
and maturity of the parents would
be decisive factors, not their sex.

As it is now,. even with liberal.

visitation rights, a man is still
disadvantaged in that his ex-wife
can spitefully relocate out of state
and thus prevent him from seeing
his children. I have even known of
cases where women used this as a
threat tomanipulate men who were
close to their children. Of course,
either way the male pays all the
support. Yet why should he pay
more than half if the kids are in
school and his ex-wife can work?

All this is clearly discriminatory
and should be eliminated. Contact

. your state representative and ask

that he sponsor a bill to give men
equality in custody proceedings
and protect their visitation rights
against relocation. .
Sincerely,

Q

Pitt Theatre Production

A Circus-lull of Moliere

by ADRIAN MCCOY
What would have happened if
Moliere and P.T. Barnum could
have collaborated on a project
together? Well, they might have

come up with something akin to the

University of Pittsburgh Theatre's
current production of Moliere‘s
Mischievous Machinations of Sea-
pin. The show was directed by
David L. Rinear.

The ornate plot is typical of most
farces. Octave (Bill
secretly married to Hyacinte (Paula
Swart). His father (Larry C. Lott)
has other plansfor his son and is

‘ opposed to the match. In despair,

the young man enlists the aid of the
servant Scapin (Robert Reusch).

Scapin also gets himself involved in
another stormy father-son relation-
ship. He exploits both situations,
making them as proﬁtable for
himself‘ as he can. Of course,
things are contrived to work out in

the end, and everyone gets what

they were after. -
The production makes a half-
hearted attempt at topicality. The
17th century mannerisms of Mol-
iere’s dialogue are interspersed’
with the Watergate jargon that has
been heard too often to be funny

any longer. Hearing lines like “at

this point in time” and “expletive
deleted” onstage is like having
someone stagger up ‘to you at a
party, lean on your shoulder and
say, “Well. What ya think about
Watergate?” The effect is
dampening, not entertaining.

One comic device that works
rather well is the players’
Bunkeresque mutilation of the
vernacular. “Absence” becomes

,“abcess’ ’, “conduct" becomes

“conduit". This is funny the first
few times, but it is repeated too
often. There are only so many
laughs that can be squeezed out of
any given routine.

The division of the stage into

' three playing areas and Frank
McCarty’s
“music creates a circus atmosphere

brilliant carnival-like
for the play. The actors perform
with‘ the ‘exuberant abandon of
circus clowns and the audience
responds with child-like wonder.
The production’s colorful cos-
tumes give the actors a cartoon

character quality’ and their jerky ,

exaggerated movements make the
production a life-size marionette
show.

The approach to characterization
is interesting. It saves the actors
from falling into the stilted
caricatures that would have re-
sulted if they had played it straight.

The fathers are gangsters, the
sons are emasculated and the
women are dumb broads--arche-
types of the Late Late Show. They

Hanks) is .

are self-consciously artificial” and
there is a sense that the actor is
somewhere outside of the charac-
ter. commenting on and poking fun
at it.

Reusch gives an astonishing
performance as Scapin. He has a
ﬁne scene in which he plays six
characters simultaneously. This
personality split to the nth power is
executed with a keen sense of
timing and is one of the tightest
scenes in the play.

Scapin provides a showcase for
the varied comic; talents of the
performers. There is plenty of
good slapstick humor and at least
two different bits of stage business
going on at all times so that
audience interest never flags, It’s
a keep-’em-laughing approach that
works--most of the time. The
players are also given a chance to
display their considerable skill as
acrobats with various gymnastic
stunts in a prologue to the play.

There is a predictable formula to
the genre of farce. The circus as
metaphor for Moliere’s comedy is
an interesting and welcome varia-
tion on an often-heard and
somewhat minor theme. Unfor-
tunately, Moliere’s sense of humor
disappears in the chaos. Occasion-
ally and thankfully, it surfaces
though, to let the viewer know it is
not totally lost in the funhouse.

Buck Connery and Return of Aged I i  I 

Lancaster Highlight Latest,FIicI<s.

BY M.C. PILECKI
Science fiction has more or less

. come into its own as a viable art

from in print, but on film it hasn't
passed the comic book stage yet.
except in a very few instances like
2001: A Space Odyssey.

Usually. sci-ﬁ flicks have pic-
tured the future as a lot of chicks
(and maybe guys, too) in skimpy
clothes. with names favoring lots of
X’s and Z's. There were always
superfluous lights on every little bit
of machinery. and crude effects
tried to ‘mask a fairly thin plot.

The latest sci-ﬂ ﬂick Zardos
seemsjust like a return to the good
old days of Buck Rogers. This
edition may be a bit glossier than
those older attempts. but Zardos
falls even ﬂatter than its neophyte
predecessors. After a fairly
promising start, it sinks into a
pretentious lesson in juvenile views
on an unsubstantiated relationship
between sex and violence, and how
the human race cannot survive
without both.

What there is of a plot concerns
Zed [Sean Connery in a stunning
loincloth], a selectively bred mortal
known as a “Brutal,” whose main
purpose in life is killing and raping
the less fortunate in the vast
wasteland the earth is in the 23rd
century. He manages ‘to enter the
Vortex, a secreted paradise where
the inhabitants are immortal,

I devoid of both sex and violence,

and fairly ineffectual dullards. Zed
manages to seduce a few nubile
females, and eventually to bring
death and destruction to the
Vortex. Yawn. .
There ar a few interesting
questions on God raised in the ﬁlm,

but the plot would rather dwell on '

Connery's hairy sexuality and
totally inconsequential “special
effects" that at times look nice, but
add nothing to the story. The sets
and costumes have a basically
plastic. Buck Rogers look to them,

' but when compared to the plot,

they make a good showing.
Interestingly enough. the effete

immortals are mainly women (with

_a few beardless men) while the

would think that at least one of the
Brutals would be female. if only for
the breeding purposes discussed in
the film.

One of the better films to hit
town lately, Badlands. hit it for a
rather brief spell. Contrary to what
you may have construed from the
ads, Badlands is not yet another
one of those Bonnie and Clyde-like
epics. It’s really a rather engaging,
but disquieting movie, set in the
fifties about a young man who kills
for little reason, and his child-girl
friend who just stands by.

Martin Sheen gives a sruprising
performance as the killer devoid of
any feelings of guilt. or even of
asking himself why. He's a rather
likeable young man who identiﬁes
intensely with film STAR James
Dean (always cast as the rebel).
and manages - to balance the

- different sides of his character.

He's not schizophrenic. in the
sense that he embodies different
personalities. The same guy who
jokes with cops and gives away his
personal effects as souvenirs is
exactly the same one who coolly
shoots down more than a half dozen
persons.

Another addition to the local
movie scene is The Midnight Man.

Hollywood's oldsters a chance to
creep out of retirement. Burt

the film's two hours this makes for

an interesting mystery. but too—

quickly the flick sinks into another
one of those now-em-down cop
movies. The solution is too
predictable and ﬂatly unrolled.

Although the ﬂick is R-rated, just a
few snips on the soundtrack will
render The Midnight Man suitable
for the Late Show in another year.

Los ANGELES AP--The worst
in the East meets the best in the
West when the Pittsburgh Pirates

, and the Los Angeles Dodgers open '

a three-game series Tuesday night.
The Pirates, idle Monday, are at
‘the bottom of the heap" in the
National League East with an 18-28
record. ’
' The Dodgers lead the National

, --‘League West with a 37-15 mark.

They have a seven-game edge over
second-place_ Cincinnati.

Cincinnati defeated Pittsburgh in
two of three weekend games,
including a 5-1 win over the Pirates
Sunday.

Despite the loss. Pirate hopes
may have been bolstered by the
relief pitching of Dave Giusti and
rookie Larry Demery. _

Giusti, struggling to regain the
form that made him Pittsburgh’s

bullpen ace in recent seasons,‘

allowed only one hit and no walks
over three. innings.

The 21-year-old Demery, who
joined the Pirates last week from
their Charleston. W.Va., farm
club. allowed one hit and struck out
four Reds in his ﬁrst 1 2-3 innings
of major league pitching.

Pirate starter Bruce Kison
allowed ﬁve runs on seven hits
before being relieved by Demery in
the third inning Sunday. ‘

Pirate Manager‘ Danny Mur-
taugh said" there was a .chance
Demery would replace Kison as a

‘ starter when the Pirates meet ‘the

Giants Friday night
Francisco.

.’ Demery. who was off to a 4-2
start at Charleston. joined the
Pirates after veteran pitcher Bob
Moose underwent surgery for
removal of a blood clot from his
pitching shoulder.

Demery has been used almost
exclusively as a starting pitcher in
his three professional baseball
seasons. and the Pirates bypassed

in San

several minor league relievers after
Moose's injury. ,

That has given rise to specula-
tion that Pittsburgh may be about
to trade starting pitcher Dock Ellis
in exchange for bullpen help.

Ellis, 1-5 with a 4.89\ERA, is
regarded as the Pirates ﬁfth starter
behind Jerry Reuss, Jim Rooker,
Ken, Brett and Kison.

of hapless expansion teams,
dominated the first round of the
draft with five of the 18

_choices--their own, plus those of

Vancouver, St. Louis, Atlanta and
Los Angeles. ’

Montreal took Flin Flon’s burly
policeman-left wing Cam Connors
(376 penalty minutes). “Tkaczuk-5
like" center Doug Riseborough and
defenseman Rick Chartraw, an
Erie. PA native. both from the
Kitchener Rangers. home-grown
Mario Tremblay of the Junior
Canadiens. and 34-goal scorer
Gord McTavish of Sudbury.

The Pittsburgh Penguins got
good news from all fronts in a busy
week. They unloaded defenseman
Nick Beverley on the New York
the
Ranger captain and a former
50-goal" scorer at left wing. In two
seasons since he got his 50, he has
failed'to_reach 30, and has hardly
warranted his $175,000 salary,
highest of any NHL left winger.

Pittsburgh also-picked up right
wing Nelson ‘Debenedet from
Detroit for minor leaguer Hank
Nowak and a third-round choice
before the draft began last
Wednesday. In the draft itself, the
Pens took a pair of record-shat-
tering linemates from‘ the Sorel
Black Hawks with their first two
choices. I,

The ﬁrst-round choice was center

Pierre Larouche, who broke the’

Quebec Junior scoring record set
by the Quebec Remparts’ Guy
Laﬁeur, and the second was his
right wi_ng, Jacques Cosette, a
strong, speedy 99-goal scorer
whom the Montreal Star likens to
Yvan Cournoyer.

In later rounds, Pittsburgh chose
two members of the Memorial Cup’

champion Regina Pats, left ‘wing .

Robbie Laird (84 points and 243
PIM) and the Memorial‘ Cup
All-Star right wing, Rick Uhrich (87
points). They also took Serge
Camelin, a S3-goal scorer _from

2 ﬁNHL “Secret” Amateur Draft Finalized  

Sorel, and James David Mathers of
Northeastern University. the son of
Frank Mathers. a former AHL

‘All-Star with the Pittsburgh Hor- V

nets and currently President of the
Penguins’ Hershey farm club.
Pittsburgh’s other good news
came from Presbyterian-University
Hospital, where doctors are pre-
dicting that Penguin left wing
Wayne Bianchin will at least be
able to skatejgy the time the season
opens in October. Bianchin
fractured his sixth and seventh

cervical vertebrae [ie busted his -

neck] in a body-surfing accident in
Hawaii May 3.

Other NHL teams busied them-
selves with trades also. In Toronto,
Rick Kehoe's intention to leave the
Leafs created a gap at right wing.
The club has attempted to ﬁll it by
trading two ﬁne minor-league
prospects--left wing Randy Osburn
and defenseman Dave Fortier--to
the Stanley Cup champion Phila-
delphia Flyers for Bill Flett.

Flett suffered through an "off-
year, scoring only '17 goals after his
brilliant 43-goal 1972-73 season.
The Flyers softened the blow of his
departure by obtaining Reggie
Leach “from California for minor
leaguers Larry Wright and Al
McAdam and the" Flyers’ ﬁrst-
round draft choice.

The Montreal Canadiens have
not failed to.win the Cup for two
straight years since 1964-65. Their
chances of losing that streak this
year look a little dimmer since
goaltender Ken Dryden signed a
new contract May 24. The habs
made another defensive move,
sending reurguard Rick Wilson to
St. Louis for tough-checking
forward ‘Glen Sather.

Armand “Bepi” Guidolin, who

resigned as coach'of the Boston ’

Bruins shortly after they lost the

Cup to the Flyers,‘ said he’s' ”
received “four orjtﬁve offers,” and —

“will deﬁnitely coach somewhere.

' Wilf Paiement of St. Catherine’s as

his ﬁrst player. The California

Rangers took 17-year-old defense-
man Dave Maloney of Kitchener,
and Montreal took McTavish with,

» ﬁnally, its own pick.

round by naming Don Laraway of
Swift Current.

The talent was hardly abundant
in what,most scouts felt was the
leanest draft in many years, and it
should be the same for the two new
clubs when they conduct their
expansion draft June 10. Only.a
handful of top-notch performers
were not among the 15 skaters _and
two goaltenders ‘each team was’
permitted to protect. Among the
best players available are Pierre
Boucliard and Yvon Lambert of
Montreal, Simon Nolet, Bill Cle-
ment and Barry .Ashbee of the
Flyers, and Jim Neilson and Bobby
Rousseau of the Rangers.

1973 UCLA Bruins used to lead the
nation in rushing, rank second in
scoring and third in total offense.
Installment of the new offense has
also -produced some interesting
personnel changes.

The most notable change was the
successful shifting of Danny Myers

' from defense to wishbone quarter-

back. Myers saw considerable
action last year as a sophomore
defensive back but_his fine running
ability earned him a shot at the
quarterback position which he won
easily with an outstanding spring
season. A

Sophomore David Sims, a former
high school quarterback, showed
great potentialvthis spring working
out of the left halfback spot. Sims
played tight end last season and
has good size (6-2, 203 lbs.) and
outstanding quickness. He will
probably be teamed up with
sophomore ‘Pat Moriarty who
earned his letter ‘last year at
halfback, gaining 220 yards on 50
carries.

The remainder of the offensive,

unit has not been set but Coach
Rodgers will be able to call on
eleven additional lettermen, four of
whom were starters a year ago.

Wide receiver Jim Robinson tops
this list, having caught 34 passes
for 597 yards last season. He is

also an excellent kickoff and punt

returner,’ and is a threat on
end-around plays. Robinson
already holds two Tech receiving
records and should pick up ‘a few
more this season.

The defense had one of its best
springs ever this year despite the
change to a 5-2-4 set. Free

BY BART MACK
Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Penguins recently completed this year’s amateur‘

draft but the big news of the spring is not the advent of a
juniors-to-pros prospect that every team hopes for, but the acquisition
of an older player who General Manager Jack Button dealt for just
before the trading deadline which precedes the lottery.

For those who do not know by now, Vic Hadﬁeld is the man New
York Rnagers coach and General Manager Emile “Cat" Francis chose
as the first in what may become a line of scapegoats for his team's
semiﬁnals series loss in the Stanley Cup playoffs. -

For the. Penguins it meant the loss of defenseman Nick Beverly, wh
was acquired from Boston at the beginning of the season. Button had
six blue liners on his roster.and it was obvious at least one was
expendable. A . », .

Beverly was always what may be termed “a steady defenseman.” In
other words, he did not have the puck carrying ability to spearhead the
attack. His name was seldom mentioned when it came to outstanding
plays but neither was it associated with the opposite.

Hadﬁel.d, who is best known for a 50 goal season in 1971-72, is not

even a 40 goal man at best. He has scored-20 or more goals in each of
the last seven seasons but in these days of watered-down talent due to
expansion, 20 goal men are a dime a dozen. ‘

The Ex-captain of the Rangers, the 34 year old Hadﬁeld will be

1 planted on a young squad which will probably look up to him for advice‘

and leadership. Hadﬁeld said he “was shocked ﬁrst," but told Button
‘you can be sure I'll give you 100%." - -

But in the recent playoffs, Hadﬁeld came under extreme criticism for
his attitude,especially in the seventh game of the semi-finals. He had
just returned to the lineup after sustaining a leg iniury and wasn’t

completely healthy, but one picture stands out in my mind during that I

final game. \-

With the Rangers down a goal or two late in the game.’ Hadﬁeld
received a two minute minor and was in the box without hesitation. He
sat there, a broad grin across his face, sipping a drink and laughing
with the gate attendant. —

Now he ﬁnds himself in an expansion city with a team that has only
made the playoffs twice in the last seven years. Pittsburgh must pick
up the three remaining years on his ﬁve year pact with New York at
about $175,000 annually.

“l’ve got something to prove,” Hadﬁeld added in his statement to
the press. “I’ve got to show the’"Rangers they made a mistake.”

But if the $20,000 per man purse and the Stanley Cup weren't
enough to motivate Hadﬁeld, what can his pride mean when the
security bf those three years on the contract stands out? It will be

interesting to ﬁnd out. ’

win big with it.

But the truth is. only 15 majors
plan to use the Wishbone as their
primary offense this fall in a sur‘vey
by National Collegiate Sports
Services. andjust 10 termed it their
primary offense in 1973. against 16
in 1972.

College football is so diverse that
no offense held a majority in recent
years. Last year, for instance, a
small but potent minority of eight
teams [including Notre Dame and
Arizona State] called their offense
“multiple.”

The I. however. enjoyed a solid
plurality of 51 teams last year--up
nine from 1972--with such powers
as Nebraska. Southern Cal. Ohio
State. Michigan and Penn State.
But the survey previews a 50%
increase in all triple options this
fall.

Among those majors switching to
the Veer in '74 are six bowl teams
who have not changed coaches--
Louisiana State. Tennessee. Kan-
sas, Florida, Georgia and Auburn--
plus nine-game/winner UCLA,
which does have a new head coach.

Why switch if you’re winning?

Kansas coach Don Fambrough,
who lost All-American quarterback
Dave Jaynes [a classic pocket
passer], said, “The beauty of the
Veer is it allows you both the

‘advantage of a Wishbone and a

passing attack.”

But four of the other six winners
changing to the Veer have
experienced quarterbacks. Why
did they switch? All said their
quarterbacks are good runners.
presumably more effective in the
Veer. and good passers as well.

In the Southeastern Conference,
going from seven’ 1's in '73 to eight
Veers in '_74. a better question
might be: Why not" go to the
Wishbone run by SEC champion
Alabama? One Veer switcher,
Mississippi State coach Bob Tyler,
says. “You must have a minimum
of four running backs for the Veer
to six for the Wishbone (Alabama
used nine) and the blocking for the
backs isn't as tough."

Only three other majors with
winning '73 records and the same
head coach in ’74 are changing
offenses’: Penn State is going
multiple, Rutgers Wing-T and
Tulane Split Backs [each used the I
last year]. In all, 43 majors are
switching offenses this fall and 21
of these have new head coaches.
Among 22 holdover coaches who

are switching, 10 are going to the
Veer. No other offense claims
more than three converts.

By the way. triple-Option plays
aren't conﬁned to the 54 teams
using the triple option as their
primary offense. Most I and
Multiple teams run many triple-
option plays. And the I has always
had three dimensions--the quarter-
back. fullback and pitchman all
have to be defensed.

Of course. players win games,
not playbooks. The more uncertain
your personnel. the more inventive
you must be. That's why many
offensive ideas originate at the
high school level, are popularized

by the colleges, then picked up by _

the pros.

For instance. the I was used by a
high school coach in Texas a
decade or more before John McKay
won the 1962 national champion-
ship with it at Southern Cal. Now
the pros use it and some call it the
“Pro I." ‘

The Veer’s forerunner was the
Split-T, popularized by Don Faurot

at Missouri in the 1940s, then by,

Bud ‘Wilkinson at Oklahoma. The
defensive end wasn't blocked, and
the quarterback either kept the ball
or pitched out, depending on what
the end did. In the Veer, neither

blocked [thus freeing the offensive
end and tackle to block downfield],
and the quarterback reacts by
either handing off to the fullback--
who never knows whether he’s
going to get the ball--keeping, or
pitching out, depending on what
the end and tackle do.

The result looks like a combin-
ation of the old Split-T ‘and the old
inside belly series. At the same
time, the Veer offers an effective
drop-back passing game with its
split end and flanker-back the wide
receivers.

Says Yeoman, “We tried it in '64
but we really didn’t know what we
were doing.’ We got into it per se
in '65 and '66 was the first year we
used it entirely." Since '66,
Houston has averaged eight
victories a season. '

The Wishbone which Texas
developed from the Veer in ’68
employs a four-man or fullhouse
backfield and puts the ‘fullback

much closer to the line, forming a Y.

[heance the name Wishbone]. Its
unique’ advantage is that it can
strike suddenly in either direction
with the entire backfield. It

requires four backs who are both 5

fine runners and blockers--a large
order for most college teams. The
result is a great running attack with
the ‘long pass a constant threat.
Because of the Wishbone’s bal-
ance, it can be fatal to gamble and
overload your defense. .
