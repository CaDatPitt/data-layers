dents. She is one of the leaders in the
movement for international peace.

Mrs. Meade said in part: “The most
vital question before the public today
is the question of the abolition of in-
ternational war——-—the crime of the age.
N‘ot nearly enough people are well in-
formed on this question, as .on many
of the questions of the day. It needs

Although weaing such novel attire,
Mr. Duncan stated that he did not
expect his followersto adopt this
mode of dress. He urged a thorough
study of the Greek arts as a means
of securing the most beneﬁts from life.

Mr. Duncan speaking to the Clas-

GOVERNOR TENER IS
= GUEST OF UNIVERSITY

(Continued .from Page 1)

Mr. Tener in a short address to the
students said: “I am afraid that my
good friend Dr.‘ McCormick has
tricked me into this position. I made
him promise before coming out to
save me from any speech-making. I
have always been greatly interested
in your Uhiversity, for as you know
I am a Western Pennsylvanian my-
self. I wish you all success in your
athletics, your studies and everything
in which you are interested. I have
greatly enjoyed your student band.”

After another rousing cheer for the
Governor, the students marched on
down t'o Forbes Field. Governor
Tener was the guest of the Chancellor
at the Pitt—Notre Daine football game
in the afternoon.

Debaters to the Front!

The president of a western university
attended in.Minneapolis a meeting
of twelve of the most prominent alum-
ni off his institution in the Twin
Cities. -

Nine out of the thirteen, including
the president, had been in their college
days" members of ’varsity debating
teams. These men had not become
prominent citizens because they had
been debaters as undergraduates; they
had become leaders in. active life be-
cause they made use of the same
powers which in embryonic stage sus-
tained them in their college debates.

Forensics did not develop self_-.con-
ﬁdence, perseverance, courage. It

behavior in emergencies thereal

Hubert Latham, the Antoinette
ﬂyer, was talking at a tea to a pretty
California girl, according to the San

“Mr. Latham," said the girl, as she
took her nineteenth ~walnut‘—and—let-

“Well, no, none in particular,” Mr.

Latham answered. “Arnica or horse

but really forget whether’ you said

‘no’ to someone last night, but I had
really forgotten wh'o it was.”--Ex.

DECORATE WALL

 

tFreshmen and Sophomores in Turn

Paint Their Numerals on
Retaining Wall.

\/Vhen the S'ophomores arrived at
school last Wednesday morning they
saw on the wall below the new road
a large sign with the numerals of
1915 and some more or less compli-
/mentary remarks concerning the class
of 1914. A small crowd of the Sophs,
disliking the sign rounded up several
Freshies and, supplying these men
with scrub brushes, mops, brooms and
water, compelled them to climb the
hill and w-ith much scrubbing erase
the painted decorations on the wall.
After_about an hour’s laborious work,
there remained nothing but a large
white smear. Then under the direc-
tions of the large audience of Sopho-
mores, the Freshmen painted in large
red letters the numerals of 1914. The

. faculty, not wishing to be outdone in

this friendly rivalry, sent men—not
Freshn1en——to remove fromthe wall
all signs of either class.

‘Impromptu Dance Held. .

On last Tuesday morning the
chapel hall was the scene of a most
enj'oyable dance. The more alert fol-
lowers of the nimble -foot “Godess
landed a knockout biO\V on the others
whep on the next day of school news
of the affair reached them. The stu-
dent band furnished the music, Whllt:
about 100 people glided around over
the ﬂoor‘. . -

CHANCELLOR ATTENDS
INAUGURATION
Dr. McCormick Represents Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh at West
Virginia. Installation.

Chancellor McCormick reports that
the exercises in connection with the
inauguration of Thomas E. Hodges,
as President of West Virginia Uni-

versity, were most enjoyable through— -

out. The forenoon of the Inaugura-
tion Day was devoted to congratula-
tory addresses iby representatives of
about a dozen institutions of learning.
The formal exercises of the Inaugura-
tion took place on Friday afternoon
and were attended by an immetise au-
dience. Addresses _were delivered by
Harry P. Juds0n,,President of the
University of Chicago, and William
O. Thompson, President of the Uni-
versity of Ohio. These are most able
men, and dealt with the relation of
the University to the State.

The Inauguration address of Pres-
ident Hodges was a most complete
and exhaustive discussion of the Uni-
versity itself and of the work it pro:
poses to do for the people of West
Virginia. It was eloquent, compell-
ing, inspiring. _President Hodges ‘is
loved, not only by every person con-
nected with the University, but by all
the people of the entire State. He
enters upon h-is office under circum-
stances of ﬁnest promise. He has the
earnest congratulations a-nd sincerest
good wishes of all connected with the
University of Pittsburgh.

New Secretary for Medical Dean.

Mr., E. D. Pool, Jr., has been ap-
pointed secretary to the Dean of the
Medical school. Mr. Pool is a grad-
uate of Ohio Wesleyan. When inter-
viewed concerning ‘his duties, Mr. Pool
said that he hoped to form stronger

bonds between the students and’ au-

thorities of- the school, not only with
regard to their school work but_ also
with regard to personal acquaintance.

  Attention!

The ranks having been broken by recent gradu-
ations, eleven new men are to be recruited from the

Various ‘ classes of the ‘ University of . Pittsburgh, into_

the ,UniVersity Co. ,“A,” 18th Inf., in order that the

- Cap and'Gown Club to Elect Ofﬁcers.

The election of officers in the “Cap
and Gown Club,” which was to have
taken place on Thursday, November
2, 1911, has been postponed until
Thursday of this week, November 9,
1911, at 8 o’clock sharp. This post-
ponement is due to the fact‘ that a
quorum was not present. New mem-
bersa as well as old ones are urged
to be present.

The play which is to be given dur-
ing the “Anniversary Celebration” in
February, is well under way and
those wishing parts must turn out
regularly to the meetings, which are
held every Thursday evening.

Medicals Have Exemption. System.

The Medical Sophomores have been
given the opportunity to secure ex-
emption from a part of their exam-
inations. Dr. Charles C. Guthrie,
head of the.Department of Physiology,
announced last week that preliminary
examinations, in his department would
be held in his department during the
coming year. All men. passing these
preliminaries will be exempt from the
final test. Those men who do not de-
sire to take the preliminarieswill have
the opportunity of passing the ﬁnal
examination. The men affected are

satisﬁed with the new arrangement.

and those -interested claim that every
man will attend the tests.

Micro-Metallograph. A

The department of Mining Engi-
neering has made a valuable addition
to their apparatus in .the form of a
micro—metallograph'.

This apparatus is valuable in show-

ing the constituent materials in any
metals. By a delicately focused light
on the polished surface of a metal,
the carbon or other impurities are dis-
tinctly shown in a compound reflector
highly magniﬁed.

This apparatus is at present in Mr.
Goodale’s office in State Hall. He
will give demonstrations to any who
are interested in metallurgical work.

Classical Association Meets.

The’ first meeting of the Classical
Association of Pittsburgh will be
held at the Hotel Lincoln on Satur-
day, November ll, 1911, at 12:15 P.

V THECOVMPETITIVE SYSTEM.
V -In the past it has been the policy of
. this school to make all ‘student oﬂicers
g_'",e.lecti‘ve.,, With respect to The Pitt
 Weekly, we believe‘ that the time has
" ~ Vcome‘t‘o change this system. The elec-
tions this lastyear resulted in the
',‘/gchoice of men who had had practically
no experience along ‘journalistic lines.
_ Men chosen in such manner must de-
 V vote a large part of their term to
A l'earning.'with very little aid the busi-
..n_es_s of the paper. ' Consequently, the
‘ ;Vpaper canhnot improve a-s it-should.
._ In order to make ‘our colleVge paper
best, Vit-is necessary for its edi-
 torsgand business rnanVagers_’to -serve

 
    

- tance.

 

an apprenticeship before assuming
their duties. Knowledge of their du-
ties would then helpgeach .successive
board to improve on the preceding
boa’rd. It is the opinion of the pres-
ent’ staff that the competitive system
of choosing the Pitt Weekly staff
should be adopted. '

As the editors and business mana-
gers are chosen at the present time,
popularity is the first requisite. But
popularity does not make a good edi-
tor, or a good manager. It takes abil-
ity and training to ﬁt menifor such
offices. Only through a competitive
system can men with such requisites
be found. By such a plan, the editors
would have spent one or two years
learning the duties of a reporter. They
would know thoroughly how to do
each thing, and how to have it done.
Aside from the e(litors,, therewould
always .be sufficient good reporters to
cover all news in a satisfactory man-
ner. We suggest that the student
body consider the question of choos-
ing The Pitt' Weekly staff by compe-
tition in the future. I .

THE CROWDED GATES.

Last Saturday when t'he parade
reached For-bes Field the marchers
were forced to wait until a large crowd
of students had entered the stands.
The gates were kept closed until the
parade arrived in order to give the
men marching an opportunity to ‘se-
cure golod positions in the student sec-
ti'on. ' But the men not marching
crowded around the gates and secured
the. best seats. This should not hap-
pen again. The mefi who show their
school spirit ‘by parading from the
school to the ﬁeld should not be
forced to surrender the best seats t'o
the few students who are too lazy to
march.

‘We believe that_if some arrange-
ment is not perfected before the next
game‘ by which those parading shall
receive first entrance, there will be a
decrease in the number of men in_ line.
The men deserve great praise for their
large number at the last game, but we
can not expect them to repeat this per-
formance if they are thereby forced
to surrender the best seats to a few
disloyal students who refuse to mafch.
This condition of affairs must be pre-
ven-ted. We therefore recommend to
the management that men be sta-
tioned below the students’ entrance on
Bouquet Street to hold t'he entrance
open for th-e parade to pass in before
any of those waiting secure adm-it-
This action, we believe, would
increase the number of men parading
and at the same time give the march-
ers their just rights.

A ‘LITERARY MAGAZINE.

We have lately received letters from.
subscribers, asking for. the establish-
ment of a literary magazine. That
there -is a need in this University for
sucha paper there can be no doubt.
The old—time Courant, a classical mag-
azine, has gradually evolved into. a
newspaper. S'o there remains no pa-
per to give an opportunity for the
publication of literaryand scientiﬁc

articles_ written by students. . This V-

cl_ass of paper is-_ one_,Vserio,usly needed

 

in this University. The scientiﬁc de-
partments are very well‘ organized

while the literary courses are rapidly "

growing. A magazine is very much
needed to‘ meet the special demands
of these two classes of students.

LIVE SOCIETIES.

The opening meetings of‘the socie-
ties held last week were very well at-
tended andpromise well for their stic-
cess this coming year. At least two
societies had men of almost national
fame address their initial gathering.
Such initiative is to be highly com-
mended, as there is no better way of
strengthening these organizations. We
urge every man in the school to asso-
ciate himself with at least one club
and devote his energies to "making it
successful. It will give him ‘a train-
ing for which he will always be thank-
ful. The man who goes through col-
lege without being an active member
in at least one.’ school society‘ misses
a large" part of his college life. _ VVe
have noticed that the best and most
admired men in school‘are exceed-
ingly active in this respect. iThVis but
bears out our belief that it is the
strong men who join the societies. If
a man wishes to receive the mostfrom
his college career, ‘let him become a
worker in one or more of the clubs.

The Classical Club certainly opened
its ﬁrst meeting with great success.

Mr. Duncan made them think, wheth—_

er or not they believed him.

Our football team played a team of

1912 Class Memorial.

Dear Sir:——I have not heard for
some time of -the 1912 Class Memorial.

would urge that steps be taken imme-
diately toward collecting the money
due on the sum needed. We should

The Parade.
Editor Pitt ‘Weekly:

' Dear Sir :—On account of the com- '

paratively small body of quitters who
instead of turning out for the parade
went in advance to the ﬁeld, I with
many ot'hers was pushed outlof line
and forced to wait until nearly all had
secured admission. Consequently I
received a poor seat. I do not believe
this to be fair. I. will not prove a

quitter even if there are difﬁcultiesv
thrown in my road, but I think that ’

those who march should have the ﬁrst
choice of seats. ‘I h'ope that you will

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir :——As there have been sev-.

eral complaints made .to me concern-
ing the work of the Freshman foot-
ball team, I wish to ask you to take
our partin an important matter. Al-
though we have no coach and no place

to practice we are expected to keep V
up with the standard set by the Var-

sity. We must lose our best players
to help the Varsity. How can we get
results when we have nothing with
which to work? I suppose it is too
late to secure any betterment now, but
I have learned enough from my ex-
perience this year to desire some bet-
ter chance for next Freshman team.
I would like to see the under class
team become a feeder for the big
team. V Perhaps you will think this
rather cheeky for a Freshman, but I
do want to see the Freshman team be-

come a strong team, one on which the

Varsity can practice. \

APPEAL FOR PEACE

the deep study and attention of every
person in the world, who is interested.
in the betterment of mankind. A

“The I colonists, banded themselves
together for protection and justice
among themselves, the states of United
States, an outgrowth of colonies, work
on the same basis; so shall all the na-
tions of t'he world work out such a sys-
tem and abolish war between the na-
tions of the world.

“War is not so much to be abhored
on account of the actual loss of life,
but because war is always an injustice
to one of the parties engaged. There
is no such thing as a just war.

“One of thereasons the people of
the United States have so long held
the idea of a heavy army and navy
protection and the reason they hold
on to it today is because many retired
army and navy officers living in our

‘capital are trying to make it a mili-

tary centre. The least capable man to
answer the question, ‘what is our dan-
ger and how to avoid it?’ is the mili-
tary man. He is all right in his place,
but he is not much authority on other
subjects. p '

“More and more the increase in in-
ternational investments ought to les-
sen the need for great expenditure for
battleships in asmuch as these invest-
ments bind up the whole, so that a war
between any -two nations has a world-
wide business and financial effect. ,

“Every ‘nation is looking to the
United States to take the lead, as a
nation, in international peace work,
for she is best able of all nations to
do so.

“When you consider that 12 modern
small colleges can be established on
the money it takes to build one bat-

-tleship, and there is reasonable prob-

a-bility that the United States will not
be attacked by any nation, it seems

‘fair that, at least, no increase in our
navy should be made.” C

At the close of Mrs. Meade’s speech,
Dr; Levy spoke for a few moments on
tlfie "relative ‘value of m-oral and physi-
cal courage. “Too often,” he said,
“the men—-—the young men think that
any one who advocates ‘International
Peace’ is a mollycoddle; but this is
not at all correct, for it has been
shown time and time again that moral
courage is on a par with and some-
times is much better in quality than
mere physical bravery.”

The second half witnessed a punt-
wg duel in which Galvin had the best

of the .argument, but no near-scores,

were accomplished. In the last ten
minutes of play Notre Da.me received
the ball on Pitt’s 10-yard line but lost
5.yards on two -plays and a try for
ﬁeld goal went wide.

With Capt. Lindsay and “Auggie”

lair, both stars at their respective
positions, out of the game, Pitt’s
chances looked slim but the substi-
tutes bolth put up a splendid exhibition
and with Field Captain “Polly” Gal-
vin deserve a great deal of credit for
their stellar performance. The best
game of the day was put up by Ross
Feightner, who played tackle. He not
only bl'ocked three kicks, and played
his opponent to a standstill, but sev-
eral times tackled Notre Dame run-
ners for losses of three to ﬁve yards.
Feightner was shifted to full back for
the Cornell game, but “Chuck” Soles
did so well in practice that it was de-
cided to play Feigh-tner at his old
position,_and it warmed the hearts of
his admirers to see the way he tore
things up in general. Soles at full
played a ﬁne "game and will undoubt-
edly face W. and J. and State. He
handled kicks well and made several
good gains. “Hube”'Wa«gn-er was a
stumbling block at end and the way
he brought down runner after runner
gained great applause from the spec-
tators. Grav_es shone in the second
half particularly, and with three such

little fear need be shown by Pitt ad-
herents for that. position.

FOOTBALL i)0PE

Pitt’s scoring machine has showed
great weakness in the past three
games as no touchdownthas been reg-
istered in that time. In the Indian
game Pitt had aﬁrst down on the In-
dian 8—yd. line but was unable to take
the "ball over. In the Cornell game a
ﬁrst down was made on the, 6-yd. line
but the opponents t'ook the ball on
downs. In the Notre Dame game
Pitt made ﬁrst down on the 1%-yd.
line but could not produce the goods.
This must be improved if W. & J. is
to be defeated on the 18th.

Referee Godcharles said after Sat-
urday’s game with Notre Dame, “I
never saw two teams more on edge
to win than Pitt, and Notre Dame
were today but with all this there
was not a bit of slugging at any time
during the game.”

Had Pitt put up the article of foot-
ball against Cornell that she put up
against Notre Dame, an easy» victory
would have been registered. -

Governor Tener attended the Notre
Dame contest as the guest of Chan-
cellor McCormick. He thought the
game was a ﬁne one.

The Pitt players are in good shape
as shown by only two substitutes be-
ing used in the sixty minutes. of play
in the Notre Dame game.

“Auggie” Blair will be in good
shape for the W. & J. game.

Alliour predictions about the In-
dians materialized as they easily beat
old Penn 16 to 0 last Saturday. The
score would have been at least twice
as large had Thorpe and Jordan been
in the game according to most re-
ports. I

W. 5  Defeat
Great Saprise

When the returns of the W. & J.-
W. Va. U. game came in showing a
6-5 defeat for W. & J.~, much surprise
was expressed by the “ones who
know.’’_ Everyone had doped it out
that this team could not lose to the
mountaineers, as W. & J. has showed
some class this season.

It was probably a parallel case to
that of Pitt two years ago when W.
Va. held themscoreless. No one could
dope out at that time why Pitt didn’t
win and it was due to a certain slug-

igishness that the players couldn’t rid

themselves of,

Dope on Pitt Team

James J. Long Predicts Great
Finish of Season—Says Re-
verses Will Not Down Pitt
Spirit—Cornell and Indian
Games Discussed

 

James J. Long, Sporting Editor of
the Pittsburgh Sun, published an ar-
ticle that appeared last Saturday after-
noon in.which he rliscussed the pr'os-
pects of the football team in coming
games with W. & J. and Penn State.
Mr. Long is a student of the game

and sees many things that remains
unnoticed by most athletic enthusi-
asts, and for this reason his articles

fdeserve more than a. casual reading.

The writer has often noticed in the
past that his predictions usually come
true and hopes this case will not prove
an exception. Mr. Long says:

“In some quarters the impression
appears to prevail that the present
season is going to -be a disastrous one
for the University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball eteam, merely because the wearers
of the Blue and Gold met defeat on
two successive Saturdays at the hands
of such elevens as the Carlisle Indians
and Cornell University. Happily the
calamity howlers are too few in_ num-
ber to sully Pi-ttsburgh’s wide ‘and
growing reputation for loyalty, gamer.
ness and knowledge of football and
its possibilities, but they exist never-
theless. ‘ ,

“How any person. with an ounce of
football sense can dope it out that
Pitt’s season is going to be a failure
just because two of the hardest games
ever arranged for a local team were
l'ost, games that came, too, atsuch an
early stage of the season that the
Blue.and Gold warriers had no chance
to attain anything like their best
form, is beyond the comprehension of
those who look below the surface of
gridiron affairs.

“It :is a mistake to merely glance at
those scores of 17 to 0 and 9 to 3 that
tell of two defeats for Pitt and then
jump "at the conclusion that it is an
off year for the local boys, and that
they are sure to be swept off their
feet in the season’s big games with W.
& J. and State College.

“There are a score of things to be
considered in connection with the
two ga.mes-lost, andafter a thorough
study of the season’s developments to

GREAT STRUGGLE‘ IN-
PITT-NOTRE DAME
GAME ENDS IN TIE

(Continued from Page 6)
“Venus,” must be mentioned, as he
had a husky opponent in Oaas and
handled" him in great style. He
block-ed one of Kelleher’s kicks and
recovered the ball for Pitt on ‘Notre
Dame’s 32.-yard mark and also nailed
the same player several times on line
bucks.

"‘Polly” Galvin was ﬁeld captain in
Lindsay’s absence and putup a great
game" at center. His punting was ex-
ceptionally -good, having both dis-

 

‘tance and accuracy.

iAll the backﬁeld men did well.
“Tillie” Dewar played his usual game,
fast, clever open-ﬁeld running and
good judgment‘ throughout the entire
game‘. Brown did well, espec-ially on
defensive playing; if Graves was un-
able to stop an'end run or broke up
‘the interference, leaving the runner in
the open, Brown would bring him to
earth with a vicious tackle. The way
he spoiled Notre Dame’s pet play, a
short forward pass, broke the oppo-
nents’ hear-t and cut down ‘many
chances to gain. Brown is one of the
best defensive halfbacks ever devel-
oped at Pitt. ‘Charlie Qua-iley put up
a strong, consistent game, both -on of-
fense and defense; he handled the for-

.ward pass well and got under several‘

of Notre Dame’s onside kicks. Con-
nelly was substituted for Dewar and
showed up well, as he also did at Cor-
nell. This little fellow will “show~’en‘1
all” later in the season wh-en he gets
in the game, and it is a good bet that
he will run the team in 1912. Kerno-
hanrwas the only other substitute used

‘during the game and d-id well "at full
.back. -\

K For Notre Da.me Philbrook, Berger,
Rockner and Kelleher did well, and

the entire team is to be praised for

the high 'class of article of football
they-put up.
Detailed account of the game:
Galvin kicked off to 13-yard line.

C Eichenlaub’s kick blocked, Pitt recov-,
_ ering. Soles made 3 at center. Brown

fumbled. Eichenlaub kicked to De-
war, who was downed on N'ot-re
Dame’s 40-yard mark. Quailey made

on thefact that no other eleven was

even close to being ‘ripe’ at that time,
while the Redskins were the perfec-
tion of condition and form. On the
other hand, Coach Thompson had not
had sufﬁcient time to so construct and
develop his team as to make  even

this star-’s absence knocked in the
Pitt eleven at the beginning of the
season may be estimatediby' picturing
the Carlisle team of two weeks ago

was no. sign of weakness on’ Pitt’s
part to be beaten by the Redmen was
demonstrated last Saturday when the

would «be unfair to compare Pitt’s
showing against the Ithacans with
that made against the same team by
State or W. & J., «because Cornell had
regained a lot of strength which it

was unable to show in the earlier con- 1

tests.

7 “And at that Cornel1’s victory over
Thompson’s charges was largely of
the fluky variety, as the Ithacans got
all the ‘breaks,’ and the touchdown‘
that won the game was the result of
an onside kick that would have failed
for Cornell had not the ball taken a
bad bound and eluded Dewar, making
it possible for a ‘Big Red’ -played to
