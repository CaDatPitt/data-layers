Owl Hall or Fame

   .444. The Names

Of24Pitt Students

Ow1’s traditional Hall of Fame
received 24 Pitt students at Tap
Day ceremonies last Friday. Twelve
are women and twelve men. The
women are Lois
Clements, Mary Louise Conover,
Ruth Cox, Betty Haldeman, Betty

Traditional for many years has
been the Owl's Hall of Fame. Each
yearbook has contained the 24 out-
standing men and women students
at Pitt. As in past year the men in
the Hall of-Fame were picked by a
special committee appointed by the
executive committee of the Owl.
Tradition was broken this year,
however, when the dean of women
appointed a committee to pick the
women. for the Hall of Fame. The

1 committee which chose the men was

composed of three junior men and
two members of ‘the faculty, ac-

 cording to Don Lingenfelter, BA43,”

-business manager of the '43 Owl-
Lingenfelter pointed out that ‘
this committee had nothing to do
with the appointment of the wom-
en to the Hall of Fame.

By BOB PAGE

Last Friday, some four hundred _ University undergradu-
ate students went up to the Soldiers Memorial. They went to ‘see

what they thought would be the usual Pitt Tap Day, where both
men and women, chosen by their “classmates,” were called up
to receive awards given to them for theirparticipation in the

Pitt student life.

But there were few men there to
receive these awards.; Seven Cmen
out of the twelve selected for Owl
Hall of Fame are in the ‘armed
forces, leaving »Gus Wilde, Bob
Sullivan, and Curt Greenburg
standing on’ stage “holding the
fort” by themselves.

The women selected ‘by. the Dean
of Women's oﬂice for the Owl Hall
of Fame were all there to receive
the awards, in fact every part of

Tap Day, that had any connection
with the women (and .there was
plenty) found all of them there for

. the ceremonies. .

only twice during the program did
the men have any part of it, namely
Druids, and-the,three, men onthe
stage, for Hall of Fame. The pro-
gram taking easily a full hour and

a half had some ten parts that con-»

cerned women. Maybe they foresaw
that most of the Pitt men are in the

service ~ or maybe {the "women were -

trying to let everyone know that
they were still around. (They did).

Oh well, two or three years from
now we’ll all be back and the Pitt
-men can again get themselves up
into the ranks of the big wigs, but
as long as we have Adolph, Tojo,
Benito and our own Pitt gestapo
it's,‘ pretty tough, “Se. la ‘Guerr-e"_

Paul Goodwin Is High Scorer oi Meet

Although the ﬁnal results were
the ;<ame—Pitt lost the dual Penn
State Meet, 85-46—’the track team
emerged from the “also-ran” class-
iﬁcation in this meet.

The Lions won ' 10 of the 15
events, but Pitt scored heavily in
both dashes and tied for ﬁr-st place
in the mile and high jump.

Al Peretic came in first in the 100
yard dash with time of 9:8. Tom.
Carr was second. George Smith
won the 220 dash with a time of
22:6 and Tom Carr was again sec-
ond. ln the mile run Si'nith tied with

our third.

in the 880 yard run. 4»

George Clark tied ‘for ﬁrst in the
high hurdles wtih a time of 15:8.
He also tied for ﬁrst in the low
hurdles. The time was 26:6. Fry of
Pitt was third in the low hurdles.

Paul Goodwin won the discus
with a throw of 125 feet", 5% inches.
However, he came in a disappoint-
ing second in the javelin throw. This
was won by Borges of Penn State
who got off a throw of 191 feet.
Goodwin was also second in. the shot
put. But he was high scorer of the
meet with 11 points.

“Break up the Phi Gams” is the
latest campus cry as those gentle-
men, who have taken just about
everything on campus including the
phantom All—Point trophy, won the
lnterfraternity ' sweepstakes on
Friday. The TF trackmeet was halt-
ed because of rain with just one
event completed. That event was
the 100 yard dash and-—-you guess-
ed it———it was won by a. Phi Gam,
George ’ Evans.

The winning Phi Gam entry in
the pushmobile race was manned
by Bob. Calvin, a freshman who was
in the driver’s seat. George Evans,
Bob Campbell, Howard Brooks, who
captained the team, Larry McBride,
and Roger Garris did the pushing in
approximately that order. “‘

The time for the Fiji’s was 2:50.4.
Sigma Chi was second with a time
of 3.01 and the SAE’s took third
honors with a time of 3:35.‘

real attraction lies in the ‘fact that
theidriver lies down when he drives
it. The Delt entry was disqualiﬁed
when Ted Bloomer, the next to last
pusher, fell and lost control just
before the ﬁnal exchange. ‘
The Phi Delts and Lambda Chi’s
also participated in the sweepstakes.
The trackmeet had to be post-

showers. Larry McBride, C’44,

gkesearch Bureau Reports

Severe Slump in Business
,After showing no apparent

A ihange for two months, business in
~-the Pittsburgh district underwent a

isevere slump last week, according
 -the Bureau of Business Research
at Pitt. Resulting mainly from the
sharp decline in the production of
bituminous coal, the slump is also

"attributed to the decrease in freight

shipments, trade and electric pow-
er. Compared to the business of
other years for the corresponding
periods the decrease was calculated
at 9.2 points. With one exception,’
last week’s index was the lowest
recorded for any week since No-
vember, 1941.

Department store sales were 23
per cent lower than those of last
year at the same time. Combined
sales of the district were 1.5 per
cent lower than the combined sales
of the same part of 1942.
