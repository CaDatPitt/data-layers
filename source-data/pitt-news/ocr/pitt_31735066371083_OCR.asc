Christmas tradition is lost to economic

By Marily McNeal
Staff Writer

Christ’s Mass, Christmas, Christmas
in 1985 — these three phrases all deal
with one subject, but to many people
they lead to three different images —
“choir, silence, peace  pine trees,
snow, colored lights  shopping,
crowds, slush, noise." These were
words used by one ‘Pitt student, Lara
Mikulaninec, to describe the images
that came tqaher mind.

The discrepency among these
descriptions points out the existence of
a phenomena gradually receiving na-
tional attcntionj Important religious
observances have become national
secular holidays. Christmas, as the
most notable example of this develop-

 

ment, now evokes some degree of
controversy.

Christmas, a word first used in the
11th century, is derived from the Old
English words Crisres maesse. In the
first three centuries after what Chris-
tians regard as the birth of Christ, the
commemorative events that honored
the birth of Christ were solemn
religious ceremonies. The first indica-
tion of the Dec. 25 celebration of the
ceremony appeared on a Roman calen-
dar dated A.D. 336. By the end of the
fourth century the practice of observ-
ing Christ’s birth was well established
in the Christian world.

In 1836, Alabama became the first
state to set aside Dec. 25 as a legal holi-
day. Seven ' years later, Charles
Dickens published “A Christmas
Carol." a story which encouraged the

“Christmas spirit, a spirit loosely
based on religious values yet promoted
as something every person should
have. New England gradually became
more receptive to the celebration of
Christmas and by 1845, Boston had a
number of public events to celebrate the
holiday season. There are a number of
historical accounts that describe lively
Christmas celebrations in the western
settlements and the family gatherings
during the Civil War Christmases. By
1890, every state and territory in the
United States had made Dec. 25 a legal
holiday.

But what happened? How did the
pine trees and snow of the 19th cen-
tury become the shopping, crowds and
noise of the 20th? Many studies point
to four major agents. The attention
from business, the emergence of cer-
tain economic factors. shifts in national

values and the development of mass
media advertising all played a role in
the commercialization of Christmas.

According to Martha Gottron, author
of “Christmas Customs and Origins,”
Christmas can be found as early as the
18305 when retailers used the
Christmas holidays to entice shoppers
into stores. Christmas became more
and more important to American
business during the early 1900s. Once
businesses realized the potential of this
holiday, with its cheerful ancient and
ethnic displays, nationwide institutional
support and widespread acceptance of
the “Christmas spirit," they began to
market items associated with the
holiday.

The Christmas card is a good exam-
ple of this. First introduced to the
United States in 1875 by Louis Prang,

 see page 8.

billion cards are now sent annually in
the United States alone.

After Prang, companies began to
manufacture ornaments, decorations
and lights year round. Others grew
trees, holly and mistletoe. Gradually
business became dependent on
Christmas sales and eventually
Christmas became important to the na-
tion’s economy.

The increased role of business in the
promotion of the Christmas season
quickly became tied to the nation’s
economic changes. At the end of WWI
and again after WWII, there was a de-
mand for the new products of wartime
technology. Retailers used the
Christmas holiday to encourage people
to act upon their desires and purchase
items as gifts for others. “The amount

  Ethnic decorations adorn
Pitt Nationality Rooms _

 

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s Na-
tionality Rooms underwent their annual
Christmas decoration make—overs this
past weekend.

The rooms, which are located on the
first ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, are gifts to the university from
various ethnic groups represented in the
city. During the course of the year, the
rooms are used as regular classrooms.
At Christmastime, though, they are the
focus of some special attention.

Each December, current members of
the organizations which originally
sponsored the rooms return to Pitt to
decorate them based on the traditional
Christmas customs of their ancestral

countries.

“We try to keep [the decorations]
really traditional,” said Maxine
Bruhns, director of the Nationality
Rooms program. “They’re not
something you can buy in a dime
store.” ‘

Indeed, most of the decorations in
each room are handmade or have been
brought back from their native coun-
tries. Of the 19 rooms, allbut one, the
Chinese room, prepare a decoration
display along with a description of the
customs and ornaments used in the
displays.

The most prevalent display in all of
the rooms is a decorated Christmas
tree. In the German room, red balls
signify the fall of man and a white
cookie represents the communion host.
In the Polish room, colorful 36—pointed
stars, or porcupines, hang from the tree
branches.

Another popular display is that of a
creche or manger scene. Though a
decorated tree is not a custom
represented in the French room, an
elaborate creche is, complete with

beautiful, handmade figurines called
sam‘ons.

Two of the more interesting rooms
are the Syria—Lebanon and the Early
American. The Syria—Lebanon room is
an ornate, authentic room taken from
a house which was built in 1782. The
Early American room is a depiction of
a colonial American home in the 1600s,
complete with wooden ﬂoors and an
immense ﬁreplace. Both of these rooms
are kept locked at all times and only
can be viewed as part of the scheduled
tours which are given by members of
the Quo Vadis student organization.

Members of this volunteer group are
trained in the histories of the rooms and
the cultural aspects of the countries
which they represent.

The r_ooms with their Christmas
displays will be open through Dec. 30.
They are open to the public or can be
seen as part of a guided tour. The
rooms are locked on the weekends
when they can be viewed only during
one of the Quo Vadis tours. For more
information, contact the Nationality
Rooms gift center at 624-6000.

of disposable income and the degree of
the American population in control of
this income changed,” said Dr.
Richard A. Oestereicher, professor of
American history at Pitt. “Between the
early ’40s and the late ’60s the real
disposable income nearly doubled. All
of a sudden, commercial possibilities
became much greater.”

Americans, with more money and
higher lifestyles to maintain, wanted to
buy material goods, and this need to
buy changed the way Americans inter-
preted the “Christmas spirit.”

The ﬁnancial transactions involved
in modern Christmases are mind-
boggling. Economist Martin Lefkowitz
analyzed the ﬁnancial and commercial
aspects of Christmas 1982. According
to his figures, based on monthly retail
sales statistics, Americans spent $26
billion on Christmas in‘December of
that year. His breakdown of this expen-
diture revealed that $l1 billion was
spent in department stores, $2 billion
on holiday foods and $650 million on
liquor.

The amount of money spent by
Americans to enjoy the Christmas holi-
day reﬂects a larger change in popular
culture and social habits. The results
have brought what Gottron described
as “the modern emphasis on material
goods.” In her report, “Christmas
Customs and Origins,” she cited the
diminishing focus on the religious
significance of Christmas and the
debasement of folk/family traditions as.
some of the obvious results of this re-
cent shift,

Father Brian Summers of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Roman Catholic
Oratory agreed: “Materialism is one
of the problems. Gift-giving is a good
thing, but people go to extremes and
spend too much money on expensive
items that put them in debt. Giving in
moderation is the key.”

This raises the question of who or
whom is causing and encouraging the
exploitation of Christmas. Traditional-
ly, busineses and retailers have re-

ceived the blame. Father Summers ex-
pressed his frustration: “Christmas is
supposed to be the celebration of the
birth of Christ, but it’s becoming a
showcase for the productivity of the
American business society. Christmas
is now the major focus of commercial
sales.”

Retailers and businesses see the issue
differently. Anne Fisher, Publicity
Manager at Kaufmann’s explains: “Of
course we profit from Christmas sales,
but department stores are not guiltier
than any other businesses. We get most
of the blame because we can promote
Christmas on a grander scale than most
businesses.”

 

“People like to hear the music, they
like the traditional. decorations, the
displays and theparades,” said Fisher.
“In November, they always ask
‘Where is Santa?’ All of this adds real
ambiance to the store. Of course we‘
want to be the leader, but we also con-
tribute. We have the Christmas spirit.
We want our customers to have it too.”

What are the implications of all these
factors on Christmas in 1985? One
clear effect is the commercialization of
the entire Christmas season. “The ram-
pant materialism and the emphasis on
gift-giving are examples of a larger
theme: American culture,” said
Oestereicher. “Christmas, being one
of its distant manifestations, has
become commercialized.”

To some, this commercialism has led
to the rise of a dangerous development.
Christmas is now heavily supported in

the American secular structure.
Businesses, banks, government agen-
cies all legally recognize Christmas.

“The secular aspect of Christmas is ’

a point of concern,” said Steihm. “If
it got out of hand, it’s wrong to hinder
the rights of a group to express its
beliefs.”

Amy Jonas, Assistant Director of
B’nai Brith Hillel, addressed this issue.

-“I like the holiday season and I like

going downtown and seeing people
picking out gifts for other people. The
holidays are one of the few times peo-
ple think about others. However, I per-
sonally resent the fact that personal
religious feelings are projected into the
community. There is a difference be-
tween the holiday season, something
we can all share, and the widespread
displays of particular religious ob-
servancez”

Father Summers disagreed. He said
he is alarmed at what he calls the
“tyranny of secular society.” “Secular
images and attitudes have taken over
Christmas,” said Summers. “It’s OK
to show Santa Claus, but we can’t show
Christ. There is nothing wrong with
showing your differences as long as
you respect others.”

The formal celebration of Christ’s
birth may have survived its merger
with pagan and folk traditions,‘but
there is concern over what Gottron
calls “its confused_ partnership with the
secular aspects.”

Steihm shows two sides of the pic-
ture. “If you see something you don’t
like, you have to go against it. Of
course, on the penny you have ‘In God
We Trust’ so what can you expect?
Society must decide how far they'll let
this go.”

“Holidays, family, friends, parties,
spirit — they give you the feeling that
you’re putting bad things aside,” said
Mikulaninec. “It’s a time to relax and
enjoy the present. Holy days. Candles,
bells, church - you hope for the future
and think about what’s going on around
you. It’s not easy. You just have to
work out the meaning for yourself.”

The ofﬁcial student newspaper of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Editorial opinions are made by a majority of the

Israeli Impudence

Considering that Israe1’s very existence
depends upon American beneﬁcence, it is
well nigh inconceivable that Israeli officials
would undertake anything so brazen as a spy
operation conducted against this, its most im-
portant ally. Yet, that is precisely what has

occured.

Many Americans are justifiably outraged
over the discovery that Israeli intelligence of-
ficials had recruited Jonathan Jay Pollard, a
United States Navy intelligence analyst, to
steal secrets from Washington. In light of the
special privileges accorded the Israeli nation
(including economic and military aid that
totalled $3.75 billion this year, extended not
in the form of loans but rather in grants), it
is reasonable that Americans should expect
that Israel’s actions should reﬂect only the
deepest respect for and gratitude to. the
United States. Consequently, the impudence
of this incident of Israeli duplicity is

astonishing.

The overwhelmingly negative reaction of
the American public to this incident should
serve as a warning to Israeli officials — one
they would do well to heed. To persist in
violating the trust of the United States
government and its people would certainly
threaten the firmness of America’s friend-
ship with and committment to the Israeli
government. If nothing else, Israeli officials
should have learned that America’s friend-
ship should not be taken for granted — nor
should it be taken lightly.

Right to Choice

In response to the December 6 let-
ter by Joe Armata, I would like [to]
educate Mr. Armata to the reality that
no woman or man is “pro-abortion."
While they may be pro-choice concern-
ing a woman's right to determine the
difficult decisions regarding how to
handle a pregnancy, I know of no case
in which a woman deliberately became
pregnant in order to have an abortion.
Thus, no one advocates abortion, just
the right to choice. You see, Mr. Ar-
mata. the manner in which one ex-
presses oneself is important after all if
one’s argument is to be credible.

Jeannine Rudolph

Moral Dilemma

I am writing in response to the Dec.
6 letter of Joe Armata. I strongly pro-
test his use of the words “euphemism”

. to describe the legitimate language of

the pro-choice movement. I am certain
Mr. Armata is aware of the fact that
many persons who support a pro-
choice position have struggled deeply
with the moral dilemmas involved in
abortion and have never lightly pro-
moted abortion as the best solution or
only solution to the problem of un-
wanted pregnancy.

What is inexcusable is'Mr. Armata’s
unwillingness to confront the moral
dilemmas implied in that blood chill-
ing euphemism “pro—life.” What is
meant by pro-life? Certainly it does not
reflect deep concern for the thousands
of children who starve or are affilicted
by disease every year in this country.
The very champions of [the] pro-life
movement have been brutally instru-
mental in cutting back’ the social pro-
grams which are designed to save these
children. ~

Certainly being pro-life has never en-
tailed the slightest shred of concern for
the thousands of children afﬂicted by
lea_tl__or dioxin poisoning every year;
our pro-life president has done
everything possible to insure the
E.P.A. is deprived of the will and the
means to end this mindless, brutal
slaughter! This massacre is condoned
by many pro-lifers because it “gets
government off our backs.“

Nor do pro-lifers express the
slightest concern for the millions of
children who are seduced into smok-
ing every year by cigarette adver-
tisements deliberately targeted to 9-
and 10-year olds. On the contrary. pro-
lifer Jesse Helms is ﬁghting hard for
his mentors in the tobacco companies
and Ronald Reagan is supporting a
repeal of the federal tax on cigarettes.
These too, Mr. Armata, are violent ac-
tions that will quite literally slaughter

.millions ofour children.

And a pro-life position reﬂects no

concern for the quality of life that most

. marines and bombers would survive a

children will enjoy. The very same pro-
lifers that abhor the teaching of Dar-
winism in our schools, have formulated
one of the most vicious forms of
“Social Darwinism” ever known. In
the name of free enterprise and com-
petition. tens of millions of children
have been sentenced to lives of pover-
ty and misery. This too, my friend, is
seen by many of us as a form of
violence!

Perhaps we could replace the euphe-
mism “pro-life” with another more in-
formative phrase. An uninvited inva-
sion of the privacy of one’s body in
general and specifically one’s
reproductive system is called “rape.”
Moreover, a movement that labels
millions of well-intentioned men and
women as murderers and thus inspires
violence and hatred against those per-
sons, that movement is not “pro-life"
but rather “pro-rape. ”

If Mr. Armata and his friends on the
right will cooperate, all this pointless
name calling can be de-escalated, and
we all can get down to dealing with the
many difficult moral and social issues
that confront our society. I will grant
Mr. Armata and his anti—abortion
friends that they are deeply concerned
with abortion as a moral question. 1 ex-
pect to be extended the some courtesy.
Given that expectation, both the Nov.
20 cartoon and Mr. Arrnata’s letter are
in extremely bad taste.

In Defense of
S . D.I .

Regarding the recent claim of Robert
M. Bowman, featured prominently on
the front page of the Dec. 6 issue of
The Pitt News, that a Star Wars system
would shield an aggressor “from
retaliation from the few missiles he
missed in a first strike.”

This claim, so often repeated by Star

, Wars opponents, does not withstand

examination. For only a “few
missiles” to remain after a first strike,
the first strike would have to take out
nearly all the opponent's missiles.
What would this entail?

According to The New York Times
the United States, besides its 1025
ICBMs with about 2130 warheads, cur-
rently possesses up to 5728 warheads
atop 640 missiles upon 36 submarines
and up to 3438 warheads deliverable
from 324 strategic bombers. The
Soviets possess, besides their I400
ICBMs with 6420 warheads, 2688
warheads atop 924 missiles upon 62
submarines and up to 792 warheads
upon 173 bombers. Many of these
weapons are not even delivered by
ballistic means and. therefore. not
covered at all by the SDI.

Almost all of the missiles atop sub-

first strike. That means that the op-
ponent would unleash his massive
retaliation against the aggressor and
there would be nothing the missile
defense could do to help.

The point is that a leader consider-
ing aggression will be deterred by the
knowledge that his missile defense
could never be so effective that he
could limit damage. If deployed
bilaterally, it affords both sides some
protection against a first strike but also
makes that first strike unlikely. The
defense forces the aggressor to attack
massively if he is to attack at all (to
overcome the defense), yet the larger
the attack, the more certain and larger
‘will be the retaliation.

The ideaof a strategic defense so ef-
fective that a decisionmaker could take
out all the opponent’s arsenal except “a
few missiles” is a myth. Once that is
understood, the SDI stands quite well
on other grounds.

bones to pick with President Reagan

“The World’s Tragedy”   I

I put the title of my column in quotes
because I didn‘t invent it: it‘s the title
of Aleister Crowley‘s bitter critique of
Christianity. which was the tragic
result ofthe "holiday" some of us are
preparing to celebrate.

Like Scrooge. I can’t get excited
about Christmas. Unlike Scrooge. it
isn’t because every rotten thing that
ever happened to me happened at
Christmas. Ijust happen to be one of
those few people who know that virgins
can't have babies. I also doubt that a
truly ethical god would get a teen—age

girl pregnant and then skip town
without marrying her. (Knowing that
the dead have an overwhelming tenden-
cy to stay that way helps. but that‘s
another holiday.) How about the untold
misery resulting from millions of peo-
ple trying to follow a philosophy which
boils down to "Thou shalt be a door-
mat unto thy neighbor’s feet." or from
the countless people put to death for
having enough guts to refuse to accept
it?

To some. Christmas is the celebra-
tion ofthe birth of “the savior." Talk

about false advertising! The so—called
“savior" isn’t Darwin. Galileo or
Copernicus (who saved us from
superstition). nor is it Salk’. Pasteur or
Jenner (who saved us from disease).
The "savior" turns out to be some
paranoid schizophrenic (“he who is not
with me is against me") who changed
careers because nobody worships
carpenters.

If his influence had been limited to
his own time and place. that would
have been bad enough. No such luck.
There were inquisitions. witch hunts.

anti—Semitism. crusades. torture.
slaughter. and today. thanks to Chris-
tianity. our whole culture is plagued by
ignorance of science. sexual neuroses.

fear of "hell“and individuals with feel— _

ings of guilt over living for themselves
instead of an electronic evangelist or
an ungrateful society.

Nor is western civilization the only
victim. Christianity gave us the
untenable notions that property. wealth
and capitalism are evil. that individuals

must put others ahead of themselves '

. . . . . . . ‘_1 ., _*
and that it is just to initiate force on any

who disagree with these doctrines. -In
short. Christianity paved the way for

the enslavement of over one-third of the _l 4

world under communism.

But don‘t think for a minute that
there's nothing to celebrate. You're
alive. educated (or soon will be),
healthy. relatively well-fed. and soon
you'll be enjoying a well-earned rest
from your studies. And there is some-
one in your life worth caring about and
believing in. (If you’re wondering who.
go look in a mirror.)

So have a nice break. See you next
term!

Washington Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen

"Monty Python’s The Life of
Brian," a film parody of Biblical ex-
travaganzas, is the story of a man born
the same moment and on the same
street as Jesus and mistaken for him
ever after. His every word, no matter
how meaningless, is taken for Biblical
writ by his followers, who then strain
to figure out what in the world their
false Messiah might have meant. We
have among us a new Brian. For his
name, see the first two words of the
next paragraph.

Ronald Reagan. The other day, The
New York Times dispatched a cor-
respondent to a conference on space
technology at Colorado Springs to ask
various scientists what they thought of
one of President Reagan’s latest utter-
ances — his proposal to share the
Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars)
system with the Soviets.

“I just don’t understand it,” said
William Rector, a vice president of the

General Dynamics Corp. “It seems to
run counter to everything else they are
doing. Itjust doesn’t make any sense."
Other defense executives and scientists
made similar remarks. except for Lt.
Gen. James A. Abrahamson, who
heads the government’s Star Wars pro-
gram. ‘4‘I don’t think the question is ap-
propriate,” he said. Oh. Pardon us.
The reason few would state their
‘opinion is that no one has the foggiest
notion of what the president is talking
about. Twice now he has said that he
would be willing to share Star~Wars
technology with the Soviets. His last
comment along these lines was made
in October when he was asked by a
BBC interviewer whether he would be
willing to provide SDI “off the shelf”
to the Russians. “Why not?” the presi-
dent. of all the people, responded.
Everyone else can tell him why not.
Because, as the Soviets in particular
realize, elements of Star Wars can be

used offensively as well as defensively.
Its land— and space-based lasers. in con-
junction with measures that could either
overwhelm or fool another defensive
Star Wars system. could be used to
conceal a nuclear first strike. We would
not want an enemy to have that kind
of technology, nor, for that matter,
would we want it to have the supercom-
puter necessary to make that kind’ of
technology work.

The fact is that there are many
aspects of Star Wars as the president
has explained them that no one but he
understands. Only the president. for in-
stance. thinks that Star Wars can ever
be an invincible shield. sort of an um-
brella, so that the Soviets can never rain
missiles on our parade. Only the presi-
dent talks of Star Wars as if it were on-
ly defensive. Only the president insists
that Star Wars is non-nuclear when,
manifestly, it is not; and only the presi-
dent is conﬁdent Star Wars could result

The Difference Between Farce and Tragedy

in the elimination of all nuclear
weapons. ‘

Star Wars is too important aconcept.
too upsetting to the Soviets and too
destabilizing. for such imprecision in
both language and. it seems. thought.
At the moment. it appears to be the
main stumbling block to a general
arms—reduction agreement with the
Soviet Union. If it is worth risking
arms reduction. then it is certainly
worth defining.

That proposal would hardly be
popular at gatherings of defense scien-
tists and executives. The reason none
of them at Colorado Springs managed
to work up a giggle at the president‘s
statement is they’ve all been bought
off. Like tobacco state politicians who
cannot, for the life of us. see how
smoking and cancer are linked. the
defense industry has little patience with
Star Wars skeptics. A

Soon that mentality will spread to the

nation‘s major universities. as depen-
dent as the defenseindustry on Penta-
gon research grants. The same holds

for our European allies who. panting .

for American research dollarsgthink

that Star Wars -— like the Marshall Plan ’

— is a wonderful idea. and for the same

reason. An administration that is so ant-‘_

sy to use lie detector machines ought
to hook them up to their own experts
and ask if they think Star Wars will
ever make nuclear weapons obsolete.
Stand back lest the needle take your eye
out.

Monty Python‘s Brian was taken
seriously because he was mistaken for

the Messiah. The president is taken .

seriously because of his high office,
his immense popularity and the even
more immense amount of money he is
willing to spend on his proposal.

Unlike Brian. he is unmistakably who"

we think he is. That, alas, is the dif-
ference between farce and tragedy.

Christmas dinner was served with an
international flavor as students
representing over 10 countries gathered
in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall
to celebrate the holiday.

The feast is only a small portion of
the effort put forth by Rev. and Mrs.
P.D. Stonebraker to make international
students feel welcome into the
American culture.

The 1985 Christmas dinner was the
largest banquet the Stonebrakers ever
supported. Approximately 250 people
from around the world attended, speak-
ing over seven different languages.
Their purpose, however. was the same
-— to celebrate Christmas.

“The dinner is beautiful. I know a
lot of people in Pittsburgh and I go to
parties, but they don’t give me the same
feeling of unity that this banquet does,"

Pittsburgh’s 7th annual Sign
Language Marathon was held at
Soldiers and Sailors Banquet Hall in
Oakland this past weekend. During this
time, 56 participants who knew or were
learning sign language “signed” (used
sign language to communicate) for as
long as they could. The particpants had
sponsors who pledged a donation for
every hour they could sign.

Beautiful Hands, a group of young
people from Pittsburgh who conduct
musical performances in American
Sign Language, performed at the Sign-
A-Thon. Members of Beautiful Hands
used their bodies and their energy to
display emotions and feelings. They
danced, strutted and performed to a
variety of songs. .

The group also wore a variety of
costumes when they performed. For

ical engineering student at CMU.

Other foreign students enjoy
American Christmas traditions. “This
is my third Christmas here. I enjoy the
American way of celebrating. Where
I come from, there is not as much em-
phasis on Christmas. I come from an
Islamic culture,” said Nashat Zuraikat,
a Pitt nursing administration student
from Jordan.

The banquets began 25 years ago as
nothing more than a Christmas dinner
with guests. “The dinner evolved from
a small beginning to what it is today,”
claims Rev. Stonebraker. His interest
began when he was hospitalized. He
said he noticed that many of the inter-
national doctors appeared lonely. Then,
in 1961, a foreign student came to him
through his church. Stonebraker and
his wife invited the foreigner to
Christmas dinner. “He opened the
way: he brought friends until the din-
ner became too large for our home,”
said Mrs. Stonebraker.

Pannier. president of Sign Connection,
Pitt's sign language club, the per-
formers were clad in white sheets.
Also, during “Holiday,” four girls
danced in body suits and high heels.

When Beautiful Hands reached out
to the audience, the audience reached
right back. They “signed” out the
words and danced along with the
group. To understand how the
members of Beautiful Hands can be so
intense and perform so well, one need
only to look at the director and founder,
Karen Walkney.

At 10 a.m. Saturday, before the
marathon, on the 21st floor of the
Cathedral of Learning, Walkney, along
with some members of Beautiful
Hands, went over some of the dances
to be performed later at the Sign-A-
Thon. Walkney was dressed in sweat-
pants and a sweatshirt. As she danced,
her small, lithe body became intense
and powerful.

Foreigners celebrate Christmas

Rev. Stonebraker said he views the
aiding of international students as part
of his ministry. “It is a ministry of help
and friendship — a true perspective of
what America ought to be.”

The International Christmas Banquet
gathers foreigners together to make
them feel more at home by making
them comfortable with American
culture. "Every country has their own
way of celebrating Christmas. We just
want to show them our way," stated
Sheena Kurvilla. a 16-year-old who
spent the day cooking in preparation for
the dinner.

The International Student Fellowship
that the Stonebrakers coordinate is cur-
rently underwritten by the Pittsburgh
Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Church
(of which Stonebraker is the pastor).
However, Rev. Stonebraker is attempt-
ing to affiliate the organization with the
University of Pittsburgh so that the
ministry to international students may
expand. '

social work. She is due to graduate with
a degree in special education and
linguistics. Since 1979 she has taught
sign language classes at Pitt.

“Theuniversity is starting to become
more aware of the deaf community,”
Walkney said. “Now, sign language
fulfills a language requirement. Also,
as a whole, the public is starting to
become more aware of the deaf com-
munity.” _

Walkney started Beautiful Hands in
1980 with some of her language
students as a class project. Over the
years the membership has increased.
Walkney is also the adviser to Sign
Connection, which was started in 1983
by Pannier and herself.

“It takes up a lot of my time, but I
don’t think that I would ever give up
Beautiful Hands or Sign Connection,”
said Walkney. “It’s been a dream come
true for me.”

From apathy to apartheid

A semester of controversy at Pitt

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

The fall of 1985 saw Pitt students
shun accusations that they were
apathetic and shout in protest against
apartheid. Controversy continued when
student organizations joined sides either
defending Louis Farrakhan's right to
speak or calling for a cancellation of
his visit to Pitt.

Law school dean Richard Pierce’s
resignation and Pitt head football coach
Foge Fazio’s firing also highlighted this
term’s news stories.

The largest demonstration on Pitt’s
campus in years was held on October
11 to protest university policy in South
Africa. Organized by Students for a
Free South Africa and set to coincide
with the United Nations—endorsed Na-
tional Anti-Apartheid Protest Day, the
rally drew nearly 2,000 people to the
lawn in front of the William Pitt Union.

The protest was aimed at Pitt’s selec-
tive divestment policy. The protestors
were calling for total divestment of
university funds from companies do-
ing business in South Africa.

Pitt’s administration has stated that
it will continue to support its selective
divestment policy. Executive Vice
President Jack Freeman said, “I don’t
believe the board of trustees is likely
to re-open their position on divestment,
though obviously we will continue to
review the situation in South Africa.
The university supports the desirabili-

Walkney was Miss Deaf Pa. from
August 1983 to August 1985. In the
Nationals, she placed in the top ten and
won in the talent competition. ‘ ‘It’s the
same as a regular pageant,” said

Walkney.

An emotional moment at the Sign-
A-Thon took place when Walkney, ac-
companied by a pianist/singer, “signed”
out a song that she wrote for her
students. “My students are my life,”
Walkney stated earlier. This message
was apparent in her song, which ex-
plains where she gets her inspiration.

The Greater Pittsburgh Barbershop

" Chorus also performed. Their message

to the people was summed up in a line
from one of their songs: “We sing so
they can speak.”

Other groups performing included
the Kiev Ukrainian Dance Ensemble,
the Break-A-Throns, and Break-
through. Performers included Buffo the
Clown, the Pirate Parrot and the Ter-
rible Fan, accompanied by his
daughter.

Why do performers participate in the
Sign-A-Thon_ and what makes them
come back year after year?

When I first came here everyone
gave me the sign for ‘I love you.’ I
didn’t know what to do,” said Vic
Cianca, Pittsburgh’s famous
policeman. “I thought that maybe I
needed police protection. Then I found
out what it meant. Now, whenever I
go anywhere I use that sign, and I
always mean it from the bottom of my
heart.”

For coordinator of Community
Resources Rita Gesue, this is her 7th
year as coordinator of the Sign-A-
Thon. The idea for the Sign-A-Thon
originated on April Fools Day, 1978.

In addition to the interpreted enter-
tainment and the marathon, many
organizations had Deaf Awareness
displays, which included information,
materials and assisting devices. The
Hearing Ear Dog Program, Universi-
ty of P_ittsburgh Special Education,
Pitt’s Sign Connection and the Catholic
Ofﬁce for the Deaf are some of the
groups that were present.

Proceeds will go to Pittsburgh Hear-
ing, Speech and Deaf Services, Inc.,
and the branch office Westmoreland
County Deaf Services, a United Way
agency. Last year, the United Way

agency helped nearly 4,000 children

ty of a strong American presence in
South Africa."

Controversy of a different sort
followed the apartheid issue with the
anticipation of black muslim leader
Louis Farrakhan's speech at Pitt. The
Black Action Society last year invited
Farrakhan to speak at Pitt, but Far-
rakhan’s alleged anti-Semitic remarks
provoked many people to protest his
appearance. Three weeks before Far-
rakhan came. Mordechei Levy, leader
of the Jewish Defense Organization
called The Pitt News and threatened
that the people responsibile for inviting
Farrakhan to Pitt “will be visited and
taught a lesson in Jewish justice. ” Levy
warned that members of his group
would be carrying firearms at anti-
Farrakhan rally the day of the black
leader’s visit.

Farrakhan spoke to a sold—out Fitz-
gerald Field House on November 14,
and the entire event occurred without
incident. Many students may have ex-
pected to hear racist comments from
Farrakhan, but many were surprised .
Cynthia Marshall, a graduate student

2 in the School of Higher Education, told

The Pitt News after his speech,
‘ ‘Nothing he said shocked me terribly,

' and I think people of all races should

take a lot of his advice.”

Farrakhan took time in his speech to
clarify what he meant by his comments
that Judaism is a “dirty religion" and
that Hitler was a “great man.”

"Religion isn't what you preach. it
is what you practice." hetold the au-
dicnce. "You dirty religion by the way
you practice religion.”

“I did say that Hitler was a great
man." Farrakhan said. “However,
‘great’ does not mean ‘good.’ Hitler
was far—reaching in his evil."

Other controversy was spawned by
two personnel changes at the Univer-
sity. The dean _of the law school re-
signed Nov. ll because of “the ad-
ministration’s lack of budget support
for the law school,” according to
Pierce.

Pierce apparently had broad plans for
improving the school, and he said Pitt’s
administration would not support him.

Unlike Pierce, Foge Fazio lost his
job involuntarily. He was fired as Pitt’s
head football coach at the end of the
season. Pitt managed a record of 5-5-1,
but with a 31-0 season ending loss to
Penn State, the team failed to get a
bowl bid and Fazio was fired.

“Why it didn’t work out?” Fazio
said at a press conference. “Sometimes
there are no answers, or I can find no
answers.”

December at Pitt — impending

finals, little sleep and not_ the
goodwill of men govern the spirit of
this season. The decorated tree in
Schenley quad and the candy cane
slipped under the door don’t assuage
swollen eyes and short tempers, nor do
they make the papers and tests
disappear.

But amid the anxiety, there is one

saving thought. One idyllic image‘
V appears on every page of that textbook

— home. Familiar faces and a familiar
‘bed provide the rationale for this hec-
tic pace and incentive for the long
‘nights.

Enter into this scene the battle—weary
freshman. In this seemingly benign
situation, he or she may unexpectedly
find yet another obstacle to overcome.
During the summer, everybody offered
counseling on that big transition from
home to school. But four months and
five finals later, the surprise hits that
three weeks back in the home town
might be an adjustment in itself. What
happened to the great expectations? No
one had any advice when these expec-
tations were dissolved by the realiza-
tion that home had not_changed.

According to Dr. Robert Gallagher,_

director of Pitt’s ‘Counseling Center, .

“A good amount of freshmen come in

to talk at thebeginning of the year due .

to the adjustment process. But a
number come injust after the holidays
as well,” Gallagher added. “Going
back into a home situation after hav-
ing ﬁnally learned to live independently
sometimes creates conﬂicts. After so
much freedom, students have to live
again by household rules.”

Many students view the application
of restrictions as a contradictory act by
their parents. Suddenly, the very peo-
ple who had once encouraged them to
be independent are now attempting to

_retract some of these freedoms.

“Sometimes I think that going home
will be a step back for me,” said
freshman Diana Goubeaud. “At this
point, I feel like I want to keep mov-
ing forward to independence.”

Some students feel that college
represents a catalyst for independence
and going home might slow the reac-
tion. Many times parents refuse to
acknowledge a change, and there is
confusion as to who is in charge of
what. Chuck Goldstein, family
therapist at Western Psychiatric In-
stitute, finds this to be a common
problem.

“You've been free now for a few
months, and you’ve just gotten com-

fortable enjoying your independence," )_

said Goldstein. “Butthen you go home
to see that your parents haven’t
changed, they may expect the same

daughter .or'._so_n who left a few months "

agol” - . 
Parental difficulties may not be the

Studentsbalance family and independence

student faces. Younger sisters and

brothers, small ﬁgures often forgotten
during the excitement, may gradually
assume a more important role in the
household as an older family member’s
position is left unoccupied. It is a time
of growth for them as well; by no
longer having an example to follow,
they may begin to develop a greater in-
dividuality. As much as this is an en-
couraging sight, the older sibling may
feel some remorse about having
missed this important change.
“When I left for school my freshman
year, my younger brother was shorter
than me,” reflected senior Barb Rigby.
'-‘‘But the very first time I came home,
he was two inches taller than me. It
kind of bothered me because I felt like
I missed something."

Lorelie Rivera, a freshman from
Puerto -Rico, experienced a similar
situation with two small neighbors to
whom she had become very attached.
"When I came home.” she remem-
bered, “the baby had gotten so huge;
he didn’t recognize me at first. It was
sort of frustrating, but I guess I
understood."

Often most surprising to many stu-
dents is the realization that they can no
longer take for granted their relation-
ship with younger siblings. These in-
dividuals may be developing into dif-
ferent people; since the student is not
there to witness and take part in, this
change, it may be necessary to become
-reacquainted. 5

By Kathy Campbell
Staff Writer

“At the darkest time of the year. we
look for a new light —— a sign of hope.
For Christians, this light is the light of
Christ, and his coming is celebrated in
Christmas. For Jews, the light is the
light of freedom. Both holidays occur
at the darkest time of the year.
regardless of whether or not Christ was
actually born at this time. or the battle
was fought at this time.”

— Rabbi Joseph Levine. B’nai B’rith
Hillel. —

Chanukah has been and is a Jewish
holiday that is often associated with
Christmas, but Chanukah is not the
“Jewish Christmas” that many non-
Jewish people seem to think. It’s a time
for celebration —— but a celebration of
a different sort.

“Only the public tends to associate
Chanukah with Christmas,” said San-

Community Center. “Gift-giving is not
a big part of our Chanukah celebration,
although more gift exchanging is be-
ing dong If anything it is more of a
celebration of the freedom of religion.”

Chanukah is celebrated this year
from Dec. 8-15. The holiday is a
celebration of the “Festival of Lights,”
a tradition in existence for over 2,000
years.

As explained by the B’nai B‘rith
Foundation, Chanukah is the celebra-
tion of a miracle occuring around 168

dy Snyder, of the Squirrel Hill Jewish ,

Chanukah celebrates freedom

B.C. when the first religious freedom
fighters began against the oppressive
regime of Antiochus IV in Syria. The
Jews alone refused to follow the Greek
customs and religion. and Antiochus
responded with force by banning the
Torah. the misvot and the command-
ments. and he erected statues of Zeus
in their temples.

The revolt began with Mattathias, a
priest who refused to permit idolatrous
worship in his temple. He ﬂed to the
hills and organized a guerilla war that
culminated three years later in victory.

As the Jews returned to the temple.
they found only one tin of oil with
which to keep the candelabra lit.

- Although the oil was only enough for

one day of light, the candelabra
(Menorah) remained lit for eight days.
This is the miracle of Chanukah. The
eight candles represent the eight days,
and one is lit each night in contem-
porary observances of Chanukah.

But in America, Chanukah is often
associated with Christmas. “In
America, there is a great deal of
assimilation,” said Rabbi Levine.
“Because it is a minority religion, the
religion tends to take in some of the
norms of other religions, such as the
gift-giving. But that is a syncrotism, a
blending of two things that do not
belong together. Each is unique in their
own way. For Christians, Christmas is
a central observance. For Jewish
believers, Chanukah is minor.”

But how does one explain Santa

Claus and Christmas trees to a Jewish '

child? “It is important to explain to
children the underlying meaning-of
these observances," explained Rabbi
Levine. “Santa Claus and Christmas
trees are all just a part of Christian
folklore. of fireside stories. They are
accretions, which are things that get
added on to an idea. They are only-
thereto help you get at the meaning of
the story.” '

“A lot of people feel that they have
to buy a gift every day during

Chanukah because ofthe commercials ‘

on TV," said Avigayil Deutsch, a stu-
dent at Pitt. “My teachers would ex-
plain this. I understood that what was
theirs was theirs [the Christians], but
I also had my religion. That is their
faith, this is mine. I understood the
concept of Santa Claus, but I didn't ac-
cept it.”

The observance of Chanukah is one
that has remained, for the most part,

the same throughout the years, with the ‘

slight exception of the introduction of
small gifts that some families now give
to small children during the eight days.

The food eaten during Chanukah is
traditionally that which is fried in oil,
since Chanukah is the celebration of the
miracle of oil. In the United States, the.
traditional food is potato pancakes, and
in Israel, it is doughnuts‘.

Thus, Chanukah remains very much
the same as it was originally celebrated
centuries ago, with Christmas making
little or no impact on the holiday.

A student guide to assist

searching, selecting and saving

Editor’s Note: The following com-
posite list represents the shopping
biases and idiosyncracies of the
“Campus Beat” staﬁ‘.

By Nadia Moritz and
Kelly Shaffer

Features Editor and Asst.
Features Editor

Let’s begin this shopping guide with
three basic student assumptions — lit-
tle money, little time and little residual
energy. You have seven days of ﬁnals
coming up, and according to the week-
ly budget for sleep, showers and study,
there are about three hours left over to
accumulate enough gifts for friends and
family before you have to pack up and
leave.

But there is one way to avoid anxie-
ty and trepidation. With little money
and a lot of creativity, you can do your
shopping quickly and without ex-
hausting your Cashstream card or
yourself. I

Oakland is a good place to start.
There are a lot of shopping possibilities

.in your own backyard.

0 ESSEX — Imagination is more im-
portant than money when you’re shop-
ping at this place. It’s the epitome of
color, clash and variety with shelves
and stacks of everything from soaps to
stickers, mugs, pounds of paper, pen-
cils and plastics (most of the stuff fall-
ing between 10 cents and $10 in price).
As store manager Linda Lannigan said,
“You can spend a little money and

1 make something- really‘ special

something personalized. ”

Like personalized dorm room ac-
cessories — there are at least 10 dif-
ferent shapes and sizes of clear and
opaque rainbow plastic containers,
ranging from 45 cents to $1.95, and
everything from plastic toys to ﬂuores-
cent pencils, colored soaps and color-
coated paper clips to put inside them,
plus stickers and the painting pens to
personalize the outsides.

The bead section of the store,
according to Lannigan, is especially
popular. Choosing from an array of
glass, wood, ceramic, plastic and gem
beads (ranging from 15 to 50 cents),
you can create your own personalized
earrings or necklaces. “You can make
a nice pair of earrings for $3 and know

that no one else has them,” said '

Lannigan.

Some other items include Christmas
coffee mugs ($5.95), life-sized posters
(Marilyn, Mick and James for $6),
soaps in liquid and solid form and
every color, style and dimension of
Christmas cards. Essex is located on
the corner of Meyran and Forbes
Avenues.

Thrift shopping is a Christmas alter-

native that also requires only a little

cash, but a lot of creativity and an open
mind. Granted, although thrift shop-
ping continues to gain prominence and
trendiness in the fashion world, used
gifts are still struggling for acceptance.
But in many cases, the merchandise is
deceptively brand new. ’

0 COUNCIL THRIFT — Don’t be
intimidated by the overly stuffed and
sometimes polyester-tinted aisles of
clothing that attack you as you walk in
the door. It takes" some time to sift
through the racks, but the bargains are
usually worth the time. Merchandise
changes frequently, as do prices, but
generally there remains a large selec-
tion of wool blazers, skirts, cotton
blouses and jeans, priced from $3 up.
When we were there Saturday, there
were blazers by Evan Picone and Bill
Blass, jeans by Fiorucci, Vanderbilt
and Sasson and a box of rubber boots
and shoes by Sporto (average price $5).

If the thought of wearing someone
else’s clothes doesn’t entice you, how
about a used pair of Rosignol skis ($6),
antiques or books? Council Thrift has
shelves of classics, trash and
everything from Nancy Drew to Har-
rold Robbins to Dreiser and Hem-
ingway, for 25 and 50 cents apiece.
Council Thrift is located at 3512 Fifth
Avenue.

0 THE OPERATUNITY SHOP —
Another thrifty place. The merchandise
is similar to that of Council Thrift, but
the men’s department is much larger.
This department sports everything from
silk tuxedos to wool Harris Tweed
jackets, to racks of cotton oxfords.
Most of the shirts range between one
and three dollars, the coats average
$20, and this week everything in the
store is 50 percent off. The Operatunity
Shop is located on Atwood Street, past
The Decade.

0 JERRY’S RECORDS — For the
music fanaticion your Christmas list,
visit Jerry’s. The only word to describe
this selection of used records is 
everything. There are singles and
albums in folk and bluegrass, ’50s and
’60s music, reggae, new wave and new
rock, country, gospel, jazz, funk,
movie soundtracks and even aerobics
music. Most of the albums run between
$2.83 and $3.77, and I’ve never pur-
chased anything there‘ that was so much
as scratched. Jerry’s records is located
at 3710 Forbes Avenue.

0 THE PRICE IS NICE — This is

I another everything store. I especially

recommend this one for those of you
with younger Madonna-aspiring sisters
like mine. This place has the Oakland
market cornered on bangles, beads and
dangles. There are bunched bracelets
in gold and silver for 99 cents, thicker
gold bracelets for $3.99 and rubber
rings in black and ﬂuorescents priced
five for $1. The Price is Nice is located
at 219'/2 Atwood Street.

Craigmstreet

Taking a step toward the hand-

’ crafted, multinational and exotic, Craig

Street offers a different vein of shop-
ping alternatives. Although the prices
are generally higher than those in
Oakland, the stores are more special-
ized and most of the merchandise is
handcrafted. The Craig Street melange
is artistic and it is only a ﬁve minute
walk down Forbes Avenue,‘ past the
Carnegie Museum and Institute.
0 WATERMELON BLUES — As you
walk in the door, the pungent aroma
of spices wafting toward you alerts you
that Watermelon Blues is not the or-
dinary gift shop. A collection of
jewelry made from erasers that sells for
$25 hangs on the wall. The store’s
Christmas tree touts Victorian or-
naments that are available to the
thematic Christmas decorator. There
are paint sets and crayon collections
next to books covering topics such as
self-analysis, feminist viewpoints and
the humorous way to handle life. On
another table are patchwork felines.
The big seller of the season is the
“Grow-A—Frog” kit for $10. For that
paltry sum, one gets an aquarium,
food, a handbook and a coupon for the
tadpole. The perfect gift for the
shower-stall opera star is the plasticized
song book that appropriately contains
“Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My
Head.” For the athlete in the family,
there is the “Official Handbook of
Thumbwrestling. ” Watermelon Blues
in the Craig Square Shops is truly the
place for the more “off-the—wall”
gift-gi_ver.
0 OVER THE RAINBOW —- Hand-
crafted is the word for this shop. It is

‘ small, crowded and charming. The

grapevine wreaths, stained-glass or-
naments and the Claus family pillows

are only a few of the handmade
Christmas decorations available here.
Unique items such as the penguins-on-
a-stick, bathtub people and the hug-
gable sock monkey are all handmade,
and mostly under $20. According to
Rainbow owner Judie Casanova, the
bread—dough ornaments,‘ needle-
pointed Pitt banners and the handmade
Raggedy Anns and Andys are the most
popular gifts. Over the Rainbow is
located at 214 South Craig Street.

 

0 MACONDO —

Incorporating
Afghanistan, India, Peru, Haiti and
Ecuador into their merchandise, this
shop has a collection of scarves, wraps
and shawls in every color and weave
to provide a combination of Yassar
Arafat, Fidel Castro and other Central
American or Middle Eastern revolu-
tionaries _ who frequently wrap
themselves in colorful cotton and ar-
my fashions. Most of the items range
from $3 to $20.

There are army surplus belts ($6),
gas pants ($10) and Swedish wool ar-

my coats ($20). The jewelry hails from
Indonesia, Nepal and Afghanistan.
Created from sterling silver, turquoise,
malachite and garnets, the necklaces
and earrings range in price from $20
to $55. For stocking stuffers, there is
Tiger balm, an oriental vapor rub
($3.50), painted balsa wood parrots
from Ecuador, and beaded wallets ($4)
and snakes in the box ($2). Macondo
is located at 406 South Craig Street.
0 PAPYRUS DESIGNS — Papyrus
means paper in Greek. Paper is the
speciality in this shop, which carries
everything from Christmas gift bags for
those who can’t or won’t wrap their
presents ($1.50-$3), to individual
sheets of Christmas paper for 85°, with
bows or ribbons to match. For a more
festive season, there are paper plates

ty. Notepaper by the pound,
calligraphy materials and shufﬂe desks
($18) are some of the items Papyrus
provides for under the tree. The store
also carries Chanukah wrapping paper
and cards. Papyrus is located at 319
South Craig Street.

0 IRISH DESIGN CENTER —
Everything in the Irish Design Center
is imported from the green shores of
Ireland, and the prices are indicative
-of this. The shop features Simon Pearce
individually handcrafted glassware and
the reknowned Kerry Glass. In the
c'lothing line, sweaters ($65), scarves
($13) and Kilkenny leather products are
available. Irish linen. and Waterford
Sheepskin rugs line the walls of this
store. The Irish Design Center is very
expensive for the normal student’s
budget, but not out of line for the quali-
ty of the products. You can find the
Irish Design Center at 303 South Craig
Street.

Christmas Cautions

[Editor’s Note: The following is a list
of Christmas shopping tips provided by
the Better Business Bureau of Western
Pennsylvania. ]

°'Shop at established and responsi-

A ble local firms which will be around to

serve you after the holidays. Never buy
from sidewalk sellers or itinerant ped-
dlers. They are never around to make
adjustments for poor merchandise or to
honor guarantees.

0 Should you have any doubts re-
garding your purchase, ask when you
buy about refund and exchange policies
of the store. The Federal Trade Com-
mission says the refund policy should
appear on the receipt. If it doesn’t, ask
the sales clerk to prove refund promises
unless they are written, especially if the
clerk who made them was hired only

for the holiday season. Be sure to hold

on to sales slips and gift vouchers to

avoid unnecessary hassles after the
.ho‘ iday 5

c

. ,1. .   1  1",. “i"3*‘*";’
.‘r.é;‘i2xctvistuseid.i;ems;:é§pec:a11yitc>ysi..

are in huge demand during this season.
A retailer offering a legitimate bargain
will often sell out of that item. Shop
early to avoid disappointments. As in-
ventories often cannot be replenished,
a raincheck at this time of year may not
help you.

0 According to the Federal Trade
Commission, warrantees require proof
of ownership. A, receipt is the easiest
way to establish ownership, which is
usually necessary to get warranteed
repairs. Even if you sent the company
a registration card, keep your receipt

0 If evidence from the past few shop-
ping seasons is reliable, electronic
games are big favorites. Do a lot of
comparison shopping and try out a
wide variety of games. It’s also wise
to test a purchased game for “bugs”
before taking it home.

0 Try to exercise the same caution
and good judgement you use the rest
of the year. Shop carefully’ for size,

Walnut Street

Walnut Street in Shadyside is a

 veritablemecca for Christmas shoppers

searching for the trendy, bizarre and
obscure (not to mention eclectic). One
can go from pot holders to pillboxes to
pearls within the space of a few blocks.
A word of warning: Shadyside is not
the place for the light-of-pocket shop-
per. Just go down Fifth Avenue and
turn left at South Aiken Ave. to enter
Pittsburgh’s most chic shopping area.

0 KARDS UNLIMITED — It may
seem to be a normal card shop, but
beneath and around the racks upon

_. racks of cards for every occasion are
“surprising gift ideas for the gift—giver.

Aside from the party supplies and
candles expected in such a shop, one‘
can stumble on the newest line of an
old favorite — theteddy bear. Meet
William Shakesbear, Lauren Bearcall
or Bearilyn Monroe, a new series of

A stuffed bears dressed as cinema

an

celebrities. Betty Boop, the cartoon
pin-up girl, abounds throughout the
store on T-shirts and as statuettes.

There are calendars and date books
with covers that express pleasantries or
facts of life from Pittsburgh to Moret,
Chippenda1e’s and the nation’s
policemen. For the collector, Kards
Unlimited has a line of masks in clay
and ceramic. One recognizable face is
that of Pierrot, the crest-fallen court
jester. The masks range in price from
$30 to $60. Another line of stuffed
animals seems to belong in the
refrigerator  they are in the shapes
of vegetables and have catchy names
such as Pearl E. Onion, Wally
Watermelon and Betty Beet. Every
vegetarian should have one. To reﬂect
the Christmas season, ornaments,
stickers, stuffed reindeer and, of
course, Christmas cards are available.
Kards Unlimited is located at 5522
Walnut Street.

I THE MOLE HOLE — It may
sound sinister-, but the Mole Hole is a
haven for the collector with everything
from trick golfballs to objects d’art.
The golf ball explodes into smoke when
struck. Hand-carved creches and
manger scenes are also available. Per- *

sonalized mailboxes that are hand— .

painted are priced at $75.95 and must
be ordered in advance. Soft sculptures
of Mr. and Mrs. Claus are displayed
next to genuine beer steins from Ger-
many. On the table by the window, an
entire Dickensian village has been set
up. The buildings are handcrafted in
ceramic and are very lifelike. The post
office, train station and market take one
back to a different time. For the col-
lector of “what-nots,” there are glass
canes lined with silk ﬂowers in various
colors. An antique gumball machine

stands in the comer as if in comparison. _

Owner Carol Zini lists the authentic-
style oil lamps as the most popular gift
item. “However, it’s difﬁcult to say
because of the large selection,’ ’ stated
Zini. She estimated that one-third of
her'stock is done by individual artists.
Perhaps that accounts for the aura of
artistic eccentricity about the Mole
Hole, which is located in the Walnut

Mall.
‘_° CHINOISERIE — Situated in the

middle of Walnut Street, Chinoiserie
brings the orient to Pittsburgh. A vast
collection of vases, mirrors, oriental
screens, table clothing and futons
reﬂect the Asian culture. Everything
has been imported from Japan and the
price tags reﬂect this. However, some
of the pieces are antiques and often
hard to ﬁnd. Another interesting aspect
of Chinoiserie is the jewelry available
for sale. The customer can pick the
beads and/or stones they like and the
shop will have them strung and knot-
ted on the premises. There are also
ﬁnished pieces of jewelry available. A
collection of black onyx and rose quartz
is now being set for customers. The
jewelry is priced according to the type
of beads, stones or seeds chosen. What
an ideal way to create a personal gift
for friends. Chinoiserie is located at
5523 Walnut Street.

0 SHOOP SHOP — For the brass
collector, this is the place. Brass
ﬁreplace equipment, brass clothes
trees, brass towel racks and brass
Candelabras are only a few of the pieces
available here. Also, cloisonne and lac-
quered serving trays are featured. For

the hunter in the family, a set of '

ceramic ducks is a must. For a unique
Christmas gift, get the hard-to-buy-for
person a clock made from an antique
stove plate or one of their decorative
weather vanes. Shoop Shop is located
at 733 South Aiken Avenue.

0 SUNSHINE — This tiny shop con-
tains clothing, handmade jewelry and
gift accessories from India, China,
Morocco and Japan. The owner,
Madhu Kumar, said that most people
come for the jewelry. “People come
from McKeesport and farther for the
earrings and jewelry. Everything is
handmade with genuine stones, ster
ling silver and 14-karat gold,” said
Kumar. The counter is covered with
racks of the dangling earrings that are
so prevalent right now. Bangle
bracelets a la Madonna, are also more
than apparent at the tiny shop. They
range in price from $7 to $12. The
clothing racks contain drawstring
pants, sweaters, robes ‘and suits. The
store also has in stock scarves, purses
and belts, in the Indian fashion. Sun-
shine is located at 5407 Walnut Street.

0 SHADYSIDE VARIETY STORE
— Shadyside Variety is the stocking-
stuffer’s idea of paradise. Rabbit’s feet,
tiny travel games, Pocket Trivia,
school supplies and various card games
are all prime candidates for that
coveted position by the ﬁreplace. One
intriguing item is the “lunch notes”
note_ pad. Sandwiched in between two
pieces of bread-like styrofoam is
packaged variegated note paper. This
cunning little gift sells for $2.45.

The owners of the store, Mark and

Every year in the middle of

. November, an ancient ﬁgure, known

in America as Santa Claus, appears

' all over the world to usher in the holi-

day season. This well—known

character is more than a popular sym-

bol of Christmas, he is the beloved

composite of religious, folk, super-

natural, secular and distinctly
American inﬂuences.

The Santa Claus we know today
developed from the actual existence
of Saint Nicholas, the fourth century
Bishop of Myra. According to
historical sources, Nicholas was
elected bishop while still a young man
and became reknowned throughout
Asia Minor for what one contem-
porary, Saint Simeon, called his “vir-
tue and goodness.” Stories about his
good deeds became the foundations
upon which later myths and mysteries

Santa  A History

    

developed. ,

In colonial America, the Puritan
disregard of Christmas as an outdated
pagan ceremony excluded St.
Nicholas from early American tradi-
tions. However, when the Dutch
came over to the New World, they
brought their conception of Saint
-Nicholas sliding down chimneys with
them. Saint Nicholas became San
Nicolaas, Si_nter'Klaas and ﬁnally
Santa Claus. Later German and Irish
immigrants helped establish the
festive mood that now surrounds this
holiday character. The kind yet
austere bishop became a cheerful and
stout gentleman with a white beard
and a red nose.

The Dutch originally associated
Santa Claus with January 6, the tradi-
tional feast day, but soon Santa, and
the myths that accompanied him,
moved to December 25. Santa
became known as a delightful mix of
human kindness and elﬁn other-
worldliness. In this way, the mystical
attributes of Christ were carried over

to the jolly folk character.

Now introduced into American
society, Santa underwent changes at
the hands of writers and artists. Many
authoritative sources agree that “A
Visit from St. Nicholas,” the poem
by Clement C. Moore, played an im-
portant role in establishing Santa
Claus in popular American culture.
Moore is credited as the ﬁrst’ to depict
S a n t a

Claus in a sleigh pulled by eight ﬂy-'

ing reindeer. In 1863, the ﬁrst public
illustration of Santa Claus appeared
in Harper’s Illustrated Weekly. The
artist, Thomas Nast, turned Santa’s
broad-brimmed hat into a soft cap
trimmed with fur. .

St. Nicholas’ journey, from a
legendary religious ﬁgure to a secular
American character, has spanned
several centuries and incorporated
many interesting influences.
Although some regard Santa as little
more than a plastic spokesman for
Christmas commercialism, there are
many more who welcome his arrival.

Believe it or not, Santa Claus is
alive and well and living on Brighton
Road in Pittsburgh. But if you were
to ask Rachel Workman who the old
fellow that lives there is, she'd prob-
ably just say that -it was her
' grandfather.

Seven-year-old Rachel, a devout
believer in Santa'Claus who would be
the ﬁrst to know if Santa were pad-
ding around her house, is correct in
a way. Her grandfather, Charles
Huckestein Sr., for a few days each
year, becomes Santa Claus. And he
loves it.

“There’s nothing like it when the
kids look up at you with those big,
innocent eyes,” he said. “It’s like
looking into the faces of angels.”

“I’ve seen at least seven years’
worth of Santa Clauses, and he’s the
best,” said Tony Mastrangelo, direc-
tor of advertising promotions for the
Allegheny Center Mall, where
Huckestein works as one of four San-
tas. “He does a super job.”

Huckestein, a 69-year-old, brings
a lot of experience to his role as Santa
Claus, which he performs from 11
a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Fri-
day. ‘ ‘You might say, ‘He wears the
wig well,’ ” said Mastrangelo,

At 5-8 and 225 lbs., Huckestein
most obviously brings a natural
physique to his job. But there’s more
to being Santa than just being round.

In his Santa suit, Huckestein comes
across as a solid, substantial-sort-of
round, as opposed to a fat sort of
round. And his height seems ap-
propriate for one.who deals mostly
with children and elves.

In addition, he brings 25 years of
‘savvy which he cultivated as an ap-
pliance salesman for Sears, an asset
when dealing with children who come
to him with interrninably long lists or
no lists at all.

“One kid said, ‘Santa Claus is a
fake.’ And then I said, ‘Oh, then you
don't want anything for Christmas, .

._.<,1o 1/r91,1,?,?._?0h, nth? h.s?.sai.d,- .‘0h "93

 

called Huckestein. A bit of
psychology never hurt a Santa.

Probably the best experience which
Huckestein brings to his job, though,
is that which he’s gained by being a
father, grandfather and great-
grandfather. -

At one time in his life, he worked
as a cemetary caretaker,’ delivered
papers and sold eggs in addition to
his jobas a salesman, so that he could
provide for his nine children and his
wife Hazel, to whom he’s been mar-
ried for 44 years.

“My 1ife’s been very plain but very
nice,” he said. “I guess maybe I por-
tray that through Santa Claus.”

Sitting in his red sleigh at work,
Huckestein greets visitors of all ages
as they walk up the ramp to see him
or to have their pictures taken. He
recalls four nurses who once had their
pictures taken with him, a lady who
asked for a waterbed and another lady
who asked for a man. “You can’t
promise the moon,” he said . His
favorite visitors, though, are the
children.

As he reaches down to pick up a
little girl, she spreads her arms wide
and buries her face in his silky, white
beard and gives him a hug.

“This is the biggest day of the year
for them, to come and see Santa
Claus,” said Huckestein. He’s not
about to disappoint them.

“I ask leading questions,” he said
disclosing his methods for dealing
with kids who are shy around him.
“I don’t like to scare them. I’ll tell
them to come back later. Eventual-
ly, they get used to me.”

As 4 p.m. nears, Santa and his
helper begin to wrap up their shift for
the day. Huckestein places a sign on
his sleigh which shows the time when

the next Santa, a young, fat sort of ‘

round guy will be back.

Walking through the mall to his
dressing room, he returns every
wave, offers some of his own and
stops to shake hands withthe children
he passes..

harried commuter anxious to get
home. His traditional, red and white
suit has been replaced with a beige
golfer’s cap and a green windbreaker.
Short, gray whiskers pepper his face
beneath black—framed glasses. Santa
forgot to shave this morning.

Taking the last remaining seat, he
looked up, “Hope you don’t mind
standing,” he said. “Unless you’d
like to sit on my lap.” A woman
seated nearby smiles at the comment,
unaware of Huckestein’s alter ego.

At home and away from Rachel’s
young ears, Huckestein relaxes
before dinner. The walls of his
bedroom are full of pictures of his
children, his 23 grandchildren and his
two great-grandchildren.

This is his third consecutive season
as Santa at the mall. He ﬁrst por-
trayed him 17 years ago at a Sears
store.. “None of them have ever
recognized me,” he says, motioning
to the pictures.

“I have pictures of me sitting on ‘

his lap when I was little and I'didn’t
even know it was him,” said his
daughter, Jean, 26, Rachel’s mom.

Sitting at his tidy little desk,
Huckestein continues to talk about the
children.

“They're «so honest,” he said.
‘.‘They’ll tell you anything like, ‘My
dad beat my mother,’ or, ‘Can you
get me a new daddy?’ ” But he’s
quick to respond when asked about
this year’s most requested gift,
“Those damn dolls,” he said. “The
Cabbage Patch Kids.”

After all these years of playingSan-
ta, one might think that Huckestein
would come to believe in the persona
he brings to life for so many people
every season. In fact, he does.

“I think I do,” he said, sincerely.
“There’s a magic of Christmas. How
do you think I raised nine kids?” he
asked. “Somebody helped me.” _

Lest one think that being Santa is
all fun and games, though, Saint
Nicholas Huckestein is quick to point
out the biggest drawback of the role.
“The only bad thing about his job is

Stockings date back a long way
— long enough to represent more
than * insignificant footwear. It is
surprising, then, that with as many
people who dutifully begin to recite
“T’was the night before
Christmas,” few ever know the
rich heritage linked with ‘these
items, or how their story has evolv-
ed through the years to become an
integral part of Christmas folklore.

Although the legend of the stock-
ing is open to argument, there are

‘ a few speculations as to why it has

emerged as the official holiday gift
holder. Well~known is the idea that
stockings had been hung by the
fireplace to dry. In some parts of
France and Germany, however,
they assumed the additional impor-
tance of warding off evil spirits and

Stockings are not just foo

stockings may have been put by the
fireplace to bring good luck.

As the legend has it, this good
luck may have come in the form of
the Bishop of Myra, a fourth cen-
tury philanthropist better known as
Saint Nicholas. Although the
bishop was supposedly quite well
off, he was a benevolent type and
liked to spread his wealth around.
Naturally, however, the good
bishop was also extremely modest,
and because he didn’t like to be
thanked for his efforts, he often sent
his contributions anonymously.

This penchant for secrecy seems
to have continued for some time,
often resulting in an astonished
poor family suddenly ﬁnding a sack
of money in their home. Eventual-
ly, the benefactor was found out,
and it seemed that from then on,
whenever someone would receive
a gift of unknown origin, it would
be attributed to Saint Nicholas.

However, it was on one of Santa
Claus’ (as he came to be known in
Holland and Germany) late—night
excursions that the stocking gained
its importance in history. As legend
has it, Santa was on a rooftop,
routinely sending a purse of money
down the chimney to land on the
hearth. As fate would have it, the
package fell instead into a stocking
‘conveniently hanging nearby. This
chance event eventually became a
popular custom for children, and
has seemed to remain so through
the years.

Thus, the loyal storyteller may no
longer just stumble quickly in ig-
norance over the familiar “The
stockings were hung by the
chimney with care, in hopes that
Saint Nicholas soon would be
there,” but may instead pause to
reflect upon the enthralling legend
behind these receptacles of
Christmas gifts.

Pittsburgh’s homeless prepare for the

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

These people don’t want a home
computer for Christmas. They don't
want designer clothes or a compact disc
player. They wouldn't have anywhere
to put them.

Pittsburgh's homeless are preparing
for another holiday season, and they’re
not worrying about getting their shop-
ping done early. They need the bare
necessities, like food and shelter.

Places like Jubilee Kitchen
downtown are providing the unfor-
tunate with more than just a hot meal.
“We are having a turkey dinner for
Christmas and anyone is welcome,”
said Joyce Rothermel, ’Jubilee’s
weekend coordinator. “We’re also giv-
ing out packages, presents with tooth
brushes, razors, soap and things.

“I think they really get a lot out of
it,” she said. “For people without
families, it’s an atmosphere of celebra-
tion.”

Rothermel said the Christmas dinner
at the Jubilee Soup Kitchen may in-
clude turkey or ham, a feast compared
to the usual meals served. “Our regular

daily meals consist of soup and bread,"
she said. “Some people bring jars and
bags with them so they can take some
food back to friends. We make extra
so they will have enough.”

Because of the Christmas season,
Rothermel expects more donations of
food and clothing. “It seems to be in
people’s minds now because of
Christmas. Also, we get a lot of party
extras this time of year that people
would throw away.”

Even though the kitchen will be of-
fering the holiday extras, Rothermel
said that isn’t likely to attract a bigger
crowd. “We probably won’t pick up
any new people just because it’s
Christmas. We will pick up some
because everything else will be
closed. so they have to come to us,”
said Rothermel. “A lot of people go
to other centers on the weekdays and
come to us on the weekends. Since
Christmas is on a Wednesday this year,
their usual places will be closed.”

She said they are expecting between
150 to 250 people Christmas day, a
large number of people considering the
Jubilee Soup Kitchen staff consists of
a few regular workers and only six to
12 volunteers.

Rothermel explained the meaning
and philosophy behind the kitchens
name. “It was named from the book
of Leviticus in the Bible after the tradi-
tionjof celebrating Jubilee,” she said.
Jubilee happens once every 50 years,
and it is when the Jews would plant
nothing in their fields. It was a unify-
ing celebration. lt was celebrated to
make people see that they have too
much and they have to share and give
to the less fortunate.”

Rothermel explained her role as a
worker and the roles of the volunteers.
She suggested that people who do this
kind of work don’t mind giving up
wealth to help the poor.

“I think that wealth and material
goods can get in our way of being in
a humble position to God,” she said.
“When we feed people we don’t ask
anything from them or ask any ques-
tions. I think God identiﬁes Himself
with the poor.

“Our vision at the Jubilee Soup
Kitchen is that everyone has the right
to eat — not just on weekdays —— but
every day of the year. These people are
right in our midst, not just in Africa,”
she said.

“John,” who wishes to remain

Freshman Dawn Levin saw ample

.evidence of this: “You see that they've

been maturing; that’s when it hits you
that you’re not really a part of that
anymore. You feel like they’re grow-
ing up without you, realizing that you
have to start building a friendship with
them or else you will lose touch.”
Aside from family changes, a student
of any year may notice an alteration in
friendships. This can prove to be an ex-
tremely trying situation, as miles and
time slowly undermine commonalities
despite promises to stay close. Dr.
David Botwin, associate professor in
counselor education, ‘feels that because
time spent at home is usually so lim-

0 ited, thereis a rush to update friends

on every detail. This may result in

drifting apart as now even the time _

together is spent doting upon
differences.

“There may be a ﬂood of input when
you see your friends again,” Dr. Bot-
win said. “Everyone has so much to
share that it may seem like your cir-
cuits are over-loaded. Before you left,
your family and friends had a famili-

arity about what you were involved in. ~

For instance, if you had a job, they
would know everything about it. Now,
however, you have different experi-
ences they are unaware of, and it’s a
rush to fill them in.”

Similar to the family situation, an in-
dividual may miss feeling as much an
integral part of a friend’s life as they
once were. This is perhaps most accen-
tuated when seeing them again. “When
friends tell you about their college ex-
perience, you realize even more that
you’re no longer a main part of this
person’s life,” said Levin.

A student may experience some dif-
ficulty in feeling like a guest in his or
her own home. Appearance changes in

anonymous, visits the Jubilee Soup
Kitchen often. “I come here all the
time when it’s cold out," he said. “I
take some soup back to my friend. We
need places like this and people like
this. They help people."

“I don’t know why they volunteer;
they do a lot of work that they don’t
get paid for," he continued. “They’re
good people, they don’t ask ques-
tions.”

At the Light of Life shelter for men
on the North Side, volunteers and
workers are planning a Christmas party
for area children.

“People donate toys, usually dolls
and games, to us each year, and you
really never know exactly what will
show up,” said Paul Oetting, a worker
at the shelter.

“Anybody can bring their kids here,

and they can get presents if we have
enough," he said. “Sometimes people
even donate brand new toys.

“We get many more donations
around Christmas, a lot of people send
gifts with specific instructions that they
be Christmas gifts,” he said.

Light of Life also has a special

Christmas meal planned. “Sometimes\

I we get so many donations of hams ano

turkeys that we have a few extra
Christmas dinners," he said. “One
year we had turkey coming out or our
ears.”

Sam Jefferson, a person who visits

"Light of Life from time to time, said

he respects the volunteers. “I respect
them because they got to have
something special inside to want to help
people. We need more men and women
like them.”

the house as well as special treatment
often provoke this aura of
impermanence. '

“When I first went home for a few
days, it was like a dream. I was so ner-
vous; it was an experience to see all the
changes,” said Loreli Rivera. “Every-
body was so excited to see me — like
I was so important; that was unusual.
I felt like a visitor for four days.”

Even after a few years of experience,
Barb Rigby remarks, “I still feel like
a visitor — even now. It’s most
noticeable when I go home for a
weekend, when my mom rearranges
my room. I feel like I’m just visiting
and belong back in Pittsburgh.”

 

But despite the possible conflicts
arising from the holiday vacation many
students, probably out of habit, adapt
to their surroundings and apply the key
to survival in a new environment —
compromise. _

In difficulties with parents, Goldstein
emphasizes the importance of under-
standing both sides of the argument.
“Spend some time talking with your
parents,” he advises. “You may end
up fighting because you’re not sure

who’s in charge. It’s still their house;:“»
that hasn’t changed. But it’s really a

time for compromise. Things may
work out when people remember
they’re still family.” '
Acknowledging both sides of the
situation may apply to siblings as well.
Of her own experience, Goubeaud
remarks, “When my older sister first
came back from college, I couldn’t
believe how arrogant she seemed to
have become. Then when I came home
for the first time, that was the exact
same thing she told me. I guess there
are two perspectives to see it from.”
When meeting up with friends again,
Dr. Botwin advises not rushing to in-
undate them with details, as that time

may be better spent just getting usecs/7
to one another. “Being home for just .
a weekend is like seeing somebody you.‘ V
know at the airport with an hour be- . .

tween ﬂights to tell them everything,”
Botwin noted. “But over vacation,
you’re not between ﬂights; you have
the time to take it slowly.

“You have to stop and think about
the fact that it’s you they like, not the
comings and goings in your life.
Remember the qualities that started
your friendship in the ﬁrst place,”
Botwin added. 4

Lastly, Botwin emphasizes it is im-
portant not to regard the feeling of
disorientation, in which the student
may have conﬂicting feelings as to
exactly where he or she belongs, as ab-
normal. Moreover, he feels that “by
the time you are in school for a while,

the changes will get progressively less 

extreme.”

So whereldoes this leave the un-
suspecting freshman? Anxious, ex-
cited, exhausted — ready for a break
to organize thoughts about the past

’ semester spent away. And, as he or she

may soon see, about being home too.

Xavier
wins for
second

straight
 year

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Cincinnati — Moments after Xavier
upset Pitt 83-73 Saturday night in the
Cincinnati Gardens. Pitt forward
Charles Smith sat alone on his locker
rggm stool gasping for air.
5 However, reporters quickly put
Smith back into misery by swarming

him almost as tenaciously as the Xavier .

defense did earlier in the night.

In Smith’s first four games of the
season — all easy wins for Pitt — the
sophomore scored virtually at will
against opponents not nearly as talented
as him. '

Smith again I led Pitt in scoring
against Xavier with 18 points. But most
came late in the contest when the vic-
tor was already determined. Smith shot

only 5-17 from the ﬁeld (1-8 in the first -

1 . half).

“Everywhere I went I had a man in
front of me and a man in back of me,”
ﬁgjth said. “It was kind of frustrating
because when I did get open, the per-
son was there (in front of him), and I
felt the pressure in the back, and I was
missing easy shots that I usually
make."

Xavier head coach Pete Gillon said
his defensive game plan was to not
allow Smith, last season’s Big East
Freshman of the Year, to dominate.

’ “We wanted to put a man and a half
on Smith,” Gillon said. “We really
didn’t contain him, he had 18 points,
but we didn’t permit him to break loose
and score 30.”

Xavier, 4-0, was in control for most
of the game.- Pitt’s only lead was 1-0.

Despite the fact that Pitt Coach Roy

 Chipman wanted his team to be more

disciplined offensively, the Panthers
broke out trying to fast break against

3/ quick Musketeers.

‘ “Our players were too individualistic

The Pitt coaching staff did everything they could Saturday night, but it was not
enough. The Panthers fell for the second straight year to Xavier.

tonight,” Chipman said. “We turned
the ball over too many times tonight.”

Smith believed Pitt struggled offen-
sively because they didn’t have to work
as hard for points in the first four
games.

“I felt coming into the game that our
team was used to playing that running
style,” Smith said. “We had a goal in
this game — to get the ball to Curtis
[Aiken] and let him shoot, to hang the
ball inside, whatever it was —— and it
wasn't like that at all.

“We came out rushing shots, we‘

were taking one-on-twos, two-on-
threes. I’ve done it, others did it. We
were used to doing it.”

And the result was turnovers. Pitt
threw the ball away 23 times, including
eight by point guard Curtis Aiken.
Smith had only one, but his was
possibly the most critical of all.

Pitt finally made a run early in the

Wrestlers win

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Panther wrestling team has
returned from Happy Valley in a rather
happy mood themselves. Head coach

‘ﬁmde Stottlemyer is the most happy
' of all. Stottlemyer took his under-rated
squad to the Penn State Invitational and
came back with three place ﬁnishers.
‘ For the second straight week, Kyle
Nellis advanced to the ﬁnals, but this
time he fell short of his second con-
secutive championship. After Nellis
wrestled Paul Clarke of Clarion to a 2-2
regulation tie, the senior co-captain
lost a hard-fought overtime match 1-0
by virtue ofa riding time point award-
ed to Clarke.
- For Nellis, there are some bit-
tersweet feelings. “I felt like I wrestled

areas that I need to improve."

championship. In the finals, Santoro
defeated Ron Thatcher of Temple 5-0
to capture first place at the highly com-

petitive tournament. More important- '
-ly, Santoro may be gaining respect

despite his freshman status. Just last
week, Santoro ﬁnished third at Lock
Haven University, which is another
highly respected and competitive tour-
nament. Now with his performance at
Penn State, Santoro is certainly a
wrestler to be reckoned with
throughout the Eastern Wrestling
League season.

Stottlemyer had nothing but praise‘

for his prize freshman. “Pat’s a really
tough kid. He just goes out and gets the
job done," said Stottlemyer. “He may

not always win, but he’ll always make .

the other guy work very hard to beat
him. He never quits out there.
“Santoro did a superjob up there,"
Stottlemyer continued. “What was so
impressive about Pat’s performance
was the way he came back against an
opponent he’d lost to_earlier. At West
Virginia, he lost to a kid named Mike

fweekend he came back and defeated the‘ ' ‘

 

second half, cutting a seven-point
Xavier lead to one. When a pass went
through the hands of Xavier forward
Richie Harris, Pitt had the opportuni-
ty to take the lead.

Smith returned the favor when he
tried to muscle a pass inside. The pass
was intercepted and Harris quickly hit
a long baseline jumper that put momen-
tum back on Xavier’s side. '

Xavier ran off 12 consecutive points,

and Pitt’s scoreless spell lasted over

ﬁve full minutes.

“We changed to a different type of
zone,” Gillon said. “They. were get-
ting good shots, but they couldn’t seem
to score.” /

Gillon did have an offensive game
plan that permitted his team to score
as he spotted a ﬂaw in Pitt’s 2-1-2 zone
defense. Pitt center Keith Armstrong
played the l-spot in the zone near the
foul line and Gillon said this allowed

Xavier to take the ball inside.

“They wanted to get inside and let
the guards shoot from the perimeter on-
ly> when they were open,” Smith said.
“They did it successfully and they beat
us with it tonight.”

Xavier’s front line scored all but 22
of its 83 points. Forward Walt McBride
led with 21 points, while Eddie
Johnson and Harris each added 20.

Other than Smith’s 18, Lane added
16, but he also shot poorly, hitting on-
ly six of 17 shots. Demetreus Gore
scored 12, ‘shooting a perfect 6-6 from
the ﬁeld. ‘ I

on the block. “He’s sure to be on his
way to All-America,” said Hnath.
“Maybe even this year, if not, then in

As for Hnath himself, he too had a
ﬁne weekend at Penn State. After los-
ing earlier in the tournament to Matt
Gerhardt of Penn State 2-1 , the senior
from Mt. Lebanon rebounded to earn
his second consecutive third—place
finish in two weeks. Ironically, it was
Gerhardt that Hnath defeated in the
consolation ﬁnals by the same score of
2-1 to finish third.

As for his own performance, Hnath
was rather pleased. “I’m very satisﬁed
with my finish," said Hnath. “It’s cer-
tainly a harder way to come around and
to place after losing, but it’s a good
feeling to rebound like that."

Stottlemyer was very happy with his
team’s overall performance. “It was an

Panthers fail first test of season

Panthers
learn a

lesson

the hard
Way

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor .

The Pitt Panther basketball team
started playing two weeks ago against
Westminister, but the Panther season
began Saturday night at Xavier. The
Panthers, until that time, scored easy
victories over less-than-difﬁcult op-

ponents and looked impressive in the J

process. Against Xavier, however, the
Panthers looked anything but
impressive.

Why? There are a number of
reasons. -Xavier was the first real test
for the young Panthers. They are a
team loaded with talented seniors. Two
years ago Xavier won 20 games, and
this was their game of the year. Of
course, great teams should overcome
such obstacles. Sure, the players were
ﬁred up and sure — during those long
ﬁve minutes and two seconds when Pitt
failed to score, the crowd was noisy.

But again, great teams ﬁnd ways to win -

on the road.

So does this mean the Panthers afen’t
a great team? I don’t think so. Of
course they aren't as good as they
looked during their ﬁrst four games,
but they do have that potential. This Pitt
team is _a young team and -depending
on how much they learned from the
Xavier game, they can go a long way.
The question is, though, how much did

‘they learn? _

“This is a learning experience for us
and this was bound to happen,” said
Pitt forward Charles Smith. “I’m kind
of glad it happened now. I hope the
team and myself will learn from this
experience.” ’ -

Other players’ echoed those words.

“I don’t know about the other
players, but as for myself, I learned a
lot,” said freshman Jerome Lane.
“And next time it will be a different
story." I

Lane will get a chance to prove his
point -when the Panthers go down to
West Virginia University to take on the
Mountaineers. That is the next road
game for Pitt and, as always, it will be
a tough game. The crowdlnoise will
again be a factor and the Mountaineers
will be ﬁred-up, and this could be a
repeat of the Xavier game if they don’t
handle the pressure.

“We know that when we goon the
road we have to make our own excite-
ment and enthusiasm because nobody
else will be behind_us,”said senior
Matt Miklasevich. “This game
[Xavier] was a learning experience and
just like last year, when we won a
bunch of games in a row, we have to
be able to come back.” _

Whether the team can handle the
pressure will be akey to how they per-
form in the Big East. In their ﬁrst three
years, they have yet to prove that they
can win big games on the road. They
have not been victorious ‘at
Georgetown, St.John’s or Syracuse —

all places they must win at in order to ,

be ranked among the top teams in the
conference.

“We all have to learn from the
Xavier game to get ready for when we
get into Big East play,” said Smith.
“Now we have really something to

look forward to coming into practice.” I

If the Panthers do learn from the 
Xavier game, they could go a long way 
in the Big East. If not, well, more {I
_ disappointment, may be in store for

1 Track

Pitt impressive

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

Fairfax. Va. — The Pitt track team
attended the George Mason Holiday In-
vitational this past weekend. They went
down with the hopes of coming away
with a good performance, and overall.
they were not disappointed.

“We had some really great perfor-
mances," head coach John Vasvary
said. According to the results of the
meet. he is not wrong.

0 In the 1500—meter run. Bob Weiner
finished first among the college en-
trants with a time of 3:58.43.

0 In the 55—meter hurdles, Calvin
Holmes and Jason Harris tied for first
with a time of 7.4 seconds and Eric
Cannon came in fourth with a time of
7.44 seconds.

0 In the 55—meter dash. Lee McRae
came in first with a time of 6.19
seconds.

0 In the 400—meter dash. Dorrell
Hilliman came in first with a time of
49.18 seconds.

0 In the 800—meter run, Pitt took the
top three places with Tim Manes.
David Moore and Rodney Giles run-
ning 1:5l.l, 1151.3 and 1:54.38,
respectively.

0 In the 1000-meter run, Thomas
Boggan ran a 2:28.97 while placing
third. George Iﬁll placed ﬁfth in the tri-

ple jump, with ajump of 47 feet, and

the Pitt relay teams won the -1600—meter
relay and the distance medley while
finishing fourth in the 3200-meter
relay.

In addition to this, a host of people
qualified for the IC4A's:

In the 55—meter hurdles, Holmes.
Harris and Cannon; in the 55—meter
dash. McRae; in the 400—meter run.
Hilliman; in the 500—meter run, Laws:
in the 880—meter run Manes, Moore
and Giles; and the 1600—meter relay
team (Hil-liman, Giles, Laws and
Manes) also qualified.

Besides the IC4A’s, Lee McRae’s

sophomore. this is the second con-
secutive year that McRae has qualified
for the nationals. Last year, a false start
in the NCAA finals ruined his chances
for to be Pitt‘s first NCAA champ since
Roger Kingdom.

“We were more than pleased with
the results.” Vasvary said. “There are
a couple ofareas that we did not do so
well [in]. but those were from younger
guys and they’re things that can be cor-
rectcd."

Overall. the team did a really
outstandingjob in it’s first meet oftt_i_e
season. Especially in the 800—mete.‘?-‘
and the hurdles. Vasvary noted that
assistant coach Steve Lewis was real-
Iy pleased with his hurdlers.

In being asked to select the person
who turned in the best overall perfor-
mance of the meet. Vasvary said, “I
think ifl had to, I would say that the
best performance was turned in by. Lee
McRae because he qualified for the na-
tionals; and the best performer was
Tim Manes, because he won the 800
and then came back to run a 47.9 leg
of the 1600—meter relay, and he came
from behind to win it."

The Panthers will take a break from
competition over the holidays and thefj‘
will jump back into action early in
January with a host of scheduled meets.

  Swimmers get double Win

‘ 2"’
r-’ W

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The Pitt swim team took an early
lead over both St. Bonaventure and
Marshall on Saturday, and neither
teams ever had the chance to catch
up. The Panthers won 69-44 over St.
Bonaventure and 69-41 over
Marshall.

“I was really happy getting two
\;.Lins without having to sacrifice a

v°."'uay of practice,” said head coach

Fred Lewis. “We swam fast in some
places. We had a good medley relay
performance. ’ ’

In the first event, the 400-yard
medley relay team of Rick James,
Donald Martin, Jim Emore and Scott
Jeffries took first place with a time
of 3:30.97, giving the Panthers a
lead they would never lose.

“The times were not as fast as
some we’ve had,” Lewis said, “but
the way they swam was what was
important. They gave good efforts
and put out 100 percent.”

A key victory for the Panthers

Malott, the 100-yard free Eastern

the 400-yard free relay team of
James, Martin, Jeffries and Lersch
with a time of 3:10.45.

The Panthers will have a light
practice schedule this week because
of finals. They will be having single
practices instead of double but will
continue to train until the last day of
finals. _

“We want to keep up the good,
getting in a lot of good training. We
will have five extra weeks of train-
ing than we have had over the past
years. We didn’t go to the the Penn
State relays and that gave us two ex-
tra weeks. '

“I would have liked to have gone
into Christmas 5-0, but I’m happy
with 4-1.

A 4-1 record should make the holi-
day season a happy one for the
Panthers.
