Smith,

a history instructor at

CMU since 1971 and assistant]
professor since 1973, was chosen .

from three candidates presented to
Dean Rosenberg in September.
They were Smith, Porter, and Dr.
Constance Achononu of Washing-

withdrew her candidacy after ac-
cepting a position at Shoreline
College in Washington State.
Dean Rosenberg said, “Smith has
demonstrated an outstanding
background in all three aspects of

and public service. He not only has
taught extensively in the fields of

History, but he has done compara-
tive studies on, slavery and on

Shapp Record:”Basei for Race‘

BY BILL HADUCK
Milton Shapp and Drew Lewis are
running for the Pennsylvania
governorship on the same record.
Milton Shapp’s.

And both candidates have gone to B

extremes in‘ their analysis of
Milton Shapp’s record; Shapp with
his nine page “litany” of his
achievements in the last four years
and Lewis blasting the present
administration as “the most
corrupt in my lifetime.” .

In a campaign thatihas brought
out statements on problems from
potholes to gypsy moths, Lewis has
consistently centered his attention
on “What’s wrong with the Shapp
administration?”

According, to a spokesman at
Drew Lewis campaign headquar-

ters in King of Prussia, one of.

Lewis’ main campaign issues is the
high cost of state government.

“To ﬁx a hole on a state road,"
Lewis said, “it takes two trucks,
two ﬂagmen, one man with a
shovel, and one man to watch
him."

Purging alleged corruption is
another goal.- “Running as an
indeperident four years ago, Shapp
promised he would end corruption

, in government. Now, we find -he‘s_

‘i doing business with the same old

'' Democratic machine,”fLew,is-'«.said.1 .

  

  
  
  

Naming of Black StucliesHead..
Black Students, Faculty   
Jam Chancellor's Office A‘  

By SCOTT MACLEOD

More‘ than 100 protesting stu-
dents. faculty members and com-
munity leaders jammed the Chan-
cellor’s_, small reception office for
four hours yesterday to confront
Pitt ‘officials with demands that
Curtiss Porter be appointed Black

Studies Department chairman in— _

stead of the administration's des-

ignate4Ro1and Smith.

The group maintained Porter

should head the department be-

cause he had the overwhelming
support of black students. -the
community. Black Studies‘ faculty
and even the recommendation of

a search committee.

Visibly angry, the students had
threatened to remain in the
crowded room, which serves as a
waiting area for the Chancellor’s
visitors, until their demands were
met. -' ‘

Shapp’s main campaign points lie
in what he calls the “effective
leadership of the last four years.”

He points to the state’s ﬁscal
crisis of four years ago.

“When Itook office in 1971, there‘

were $900 million worth of unpaid
bills stacked on my desk," Shapp
said. “What we have done in my
administration is restored a bank-
rupt state to solvency.”

what most indemnity insurance

Rowe explained that some of
these requirements for- certification
are difficult to fulfill. ,

“Therefore,” said Rowe, “I can
not predict the future will berosy.
It may take some time before we
become the keystone for the deliv-

Rowe said’: however, HMO would

“The health care delivery system

I up to 7.9% of the GNP," Rowe

explained. He sa_id methods of
reducing costs of health care are
constantly being sought. The

A health maintenance organization is

one of these ways, ‘fputtinge the
emphasis on prevehtiveand not
curative care," he said.

Director of Pittsburgh’s Falk Cli-
nic, Lawrence Perlman supported
the-HMO method of health care,
remarking that costs are ‘lower
and the quality appears to be
significantly better than the old
health program. He also empha-
sized that guaranteed access to
medical care is established through

» a contract in a pre-paid health care

program.

Perlman supported the provisions
ofthe HMO Act, explaining that so
far most HMO programs are aimed
at the middle and upper labor
class. Certification for an HMO is
difficult to receive because, "the
legislature wants all classes of
people to be able to apply. It, is a
concerted effort by the government
to keep people healthv."

Shapp Record Base for Race

(Continued from Page 1)

responsive to the people.

One of Shapp‘s other major points
has been to ignore Drew Lewis.

Claiming Lewis and his support-
ers are involved in a “smear
campaign”, against the Shapp
camp, the'Governor said he does
not want to dignify these smears by
recognizing them. _

He rarely brings up Lewis’ name
in his speeches and has repeatedly
refused to accept a- challenge by
Lewis for televised debates.

“There will
because of his smear tactics,’
Shapp said. “Lewis is either
misinformed, he doesn’t read, or
he deliberately falsifies his infor-
mation."

Lewis strongly disagrees. “This
is just a non-response. I never said
I would be Shapp’s patsy in a
gentlemanly campaign.”

Shapp said GOP members of the
state House Committee on State
Contract Practices led by Rep.
Patrick Gleason . (R-Camfbria
County) were trying to pin a
kickback scandal on him when he
was asked to testify at committee
hearings last month.

He denied committee suspicions
he personally profited from any
government transactions.

?

Earlier,'Lewis,’ running mate for’

lieutenant governor, Kenneth Lee,
revealed Shapp had paid no federal
income tax in 1968 or 1969. Shapp,

. after much" prodding from the

Lewis camp "acknowledges the
charge but claimed business losses
during those years deprived him of
any taxable income.

Shapp keeps his responses to GOP
charges low key, in what some
observers believe is an attempt to
take advantage of Lewis’ relative
‘obscurity.

As of the middle of September,
Lewis, , Montgomery county resi-
dent and president of Snelling and

Snelling, Inc., a national employ- I

ment agency, admitted only 78% of
Pennsylvania voters knew who he

was, but he claims his recognition.

will improve as he brings his
campaign to the middle classes.

“Education has reached the point
where only the advantaged and
disadvantaged can attend’ estab-
lished. universities,” Lewis said.
“We have to increase assistance to
middle’ income students.”

He also believes the state income
tax should stay at a flat two percent
rate. “The biggest impact a
graduated income tax would have
would be to hurt the families of the
middle income range," he said.

Shapp who started the state
income tax as part of his ﬁscal
ﬁx-up plan, advocates a graduated
income tax on grounds it would be
“more fair to everyone." He said
his tax would not contain the
loopholes of the present federal
income tax. '

Other issues the candidates have
spoken out on follow;

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Lewis
said he would have signed and
enforced the limited capital pun-
ishment bill Shapp vetoed earlier
this year. The bill called for certain
specific crimes such as police and
prison guard slayings to be
punishable by death. Lewis said,
-“Capital punishment is a deterrent
to crime.” -

Shapp’s views are different on the
death penalty. “It is well known
that I vetoed the current law,” he
said. “I could support only a very
limited capital punishment‘bill."
He defined a‘ “very limited capital-
punishment bill” as one in which
the deterrent aspect is very ob-
VIOUS. _ -

A campaign aide said this would
affect an instance of kidnapping
where the kidnappers could decide
whether or not to kill their victim.

ABORTION. Shapp vetoed two
abortion control laws introduced in
the state ‘legislature during his
term. He is, however, not in favor
of abortion on demand.

Lewis takes a middle stance on
abortion. He would favor abortion

if a birth would harm the mother’s '

health, or in the case of rape or
incest.

SKYBUS. .Lewis has come out
against the Skybus mass transit
plan for Pittsburgh’s South Hills.
However, he believes action should
have been taken long ago. “The
problem has been allowed to fester
too long," he said.

[A Shapp campaign spokesman in
Pittsburgh was relu‘ctant to com-

ment on the Governor’s ideas about .

Skybus. -“I know he’s reading a

PennDot study on it‘ right now, but_

he hasn't come out with any
statement concerning it yet.”

as to a possible withdrawal because
of the opposition.

Rosenberg emphasized that the
search and selection procedure for
the new chairman of Black Studies
was comparable to the procedure
used in the filling of other similar
posts on campus, with a search
committee asked to present a slate
of candidates from which the dean
could make a final selection.

Porter, however, doubted the
legitamacy of Rosenberg's deci-
sion. “The University of Pittsburgh
should withhold its decision on the
chairpersonhip until all parties
involved can in public debate and
disclosure state what their views of
the_Black Studies Department is,

,what their understanding of the

present crisis is, and what the
agreement between the University
and the black community (Black
students, faculty, administration
and community members) is,"
Porter said. "Such a debate should
be immediately demanded by pro-
gressive persons at all levels in this
city. on the basis of public debate a
new consensus must be developed
around each of those issues
through the elemental involvement
of black students, black _community
and the faculty of black studies.

“This incidentally should include
Roland Smith, the Dean of FAS,
the Provost, the Chancellor as well
as those other persons who have
made public statements on these
issues, and finally black students
and members of the black and
progressive community.”

According to Graylyn Swilley,
chairperson of BAS, Curtis Porter
had student support.

"The Administration was very
unfair in the decision. When stu-
dents are in overwhelming support
of one candidate how can they be
doing us a service by appointing
the other," Swilley said.

Swilley and BAS feel that Smith is
not the favored candidate to lead
the department out of its strife.
“I’m convinced the department
was manipulated and used.

“BAS representatives met with
Chancellor Posvar, Dean Rosen-
berg, and Provost Rhoten Smith on
Monday and the meeting had no
relevance to them. They were just
playing academic games with us.”

The purpose of the meeting was
for BAS members to remind the
administration of a January, 1969
agreement giving BAS the right to

“Posvar said the agreement was
derived under different circum-
stances. BAS should have been
guardians of the selection, not
addendum to it,” stated Swilley.
“We did not sign any papers

at the process used.

“BAS would like Dean Rosenberg
to publicly state why he supported
Roland Smith, whose doctoral dis-
sertation was on flood control,

folk."

“We want the administration to
know that they have totally disre-

faculty then the students should be

The search committee for the

Black Studies post included rep-‘

BAS. a representative from the
Organization of Black Administra-

The Liberal Arts Curriculum

BY ROBERT MARSHALL

In previous articles I have tried to
outline the issue of the role of the
Liberal Arts education in a career-
conscious time and to suggest a
possible defense, in terms of my
own educational biases, for the
."usefulness" of the Liberal Arts.

In this article, I would like to
suggest brieﬂy some ways in which
it might be possible to make
moderate changes in the Liberal
Arts curriculum as a, way of
accommodating to the sense of a
pressing need for more career-
oriented education. I want to stress
that, though I suggest these possi-
bilities, I continue to harbor doubts
myself about the adaptability of the
ideal. It may well be that the ideal

must be kept pure, that there is no .

room for compromise, that to adapt
is to destroy. .

Either one is committed to a
period of learning for its own sake,
with no more specific goal than the
growth of one‘s spirit and judg-
ment and understanding and hu-
manity (I blush), or one goes about
accomplishing certain very specific
career-oriented goals. And it may
be that the two don't mix. (I
remind you that I have said that I
would feel much easier about
maintaining the purity of the
Liberal Arts if there were a far
greater variety of options on the
undergraduate level and only those
students were in CA5 who were
convinced by and committed to the
philosophy of that ideal.)'

The best example of the issue that
Ican think of is the CAS rule that a
student in the College may take no
more than 12 non-CAS credits, ie,
credits offered by other schools in
the University. The simple act of
raising that limit would solve the
problem for large numbers of
students, for they could then add to
their basic CAS in' a variety of
courses from the various under-
graduate professional schools. As a
matter of fact, the recent Task
Force on Undergraduate and Ex-
tension Education has recommen-
ded consideration of the concept of
the University College, the idea
being that undergraduates should
be able to put together whatever
programs they wish from; the total
undergraduate curriculum of the
University.

That idea isn’t so harmless a one
as it might at first seem. One might
legitimately start raising points
about integrity of degrees and of

curriculum and of educational phil-
osophy. At a meeting last year of
the Self-Designed Majors in the
College [that group seems particu-
larly to be champing at the bit of
the 12 non-CAS credit rule], I found
it very difficult to try to draw
parallels between the integrity of,
say, the Engineering curriculum
and of the CAS curriculum.
Everyone seemed to accept the
fact that the Engineering school
shouldn't give degrees to‘ students
who hadn't, within defined limita-
tions, followed an Engineering

curriculum. They agreed that it ~

would be silly for Engineering or
Nursing students to claim the right
to take large numbers of their
courses outside of the school's
recommended curriculum. But
there didn't seem to be any of that
sense when one began to talk about
the right of CAS to have a rule that
ensured the integrity of its curricu-
lum and philosophy. .

I suppost that some might say that
that loss of identity has to do with
the reduction of requirements in
the College. I don't think so
(though l’ll address that issue in a
later article)’. I think it's the kind of
loss of purpose I talked about last
week.

Let me outline, then, some possi-
ble directions of adaptation for the
Liberal Arts curriculum:

1. Raise the current level of 12
non-CAS credits---either slightly
,(to 18) in order to prevent the
possibility of actually majoring‘ in
another school or, putting aside
such a concern, significantly.

2. Develop~~through6ut as many
major fields as appropriate /the
concept of the internship or practi-
cum or field work (already present
in the Urban Studies major and in
the Political Science Department's
new Concentration‘in Government
and Public Service)---the learning-

‘ through-doing ideal soipopular sev-

eral years ago, but now under the
pressure of career preparation
rather than of educational ideology.

3. As a corollary of [2], encourage
acreditation of student activity
experiences. [There are regularly

feelers from Student Government,

Pitt News, WPGH, YMCA and
YWCA and other service organiza-
tions about the possibility of cours-
es that would give an academic
base to and credit for student
activities.]

4. Develop, as many schools
around the country have, interdis-

ciplinary programs that are task or
issue or problem-oriented and

hence ultimately career-directed
though within the traditional curri-
culum. '
‘ 5. Make more explicit, advertise
more fully, make more generally
available the existing means by
which enterprising students have
given carrer orientations to their
CAS curriculum. There are uses
made of independent study and
Independent ‘Study Term_ and Self-
Designed Major that are not, I
must say, completely consistent
with the rigidity of our 12 non-CAS
rule. It is true, too, that some
students might point out that some
of the majors (ranging from certain
of the sciences to certain of the
performing arts) give some stu-

dents a leg up on career possiblities -

while others are hemmed in by the
12 non-CAS rule.

6. The vaguest, but perhaps the
most significant possibility, is to
encourage the fullest possible de-
velopment of the counseling and
advising services available to stu-
dents. Everybody, of course, says
this sort of] thing regularly. My
particular angle on the issue is the
role of the faculty and the curricu-
lum in the counseling and advising
process. I’ll have to save develop-
ment of this idea for another time,
but we have not begun to realize

the implications and the rich possi- 7

bilities of the act a few years ago of
decentralizing the curriculum
[which is what we did when we did
away with requirements].

There are countless ways in which
we can build advice, including
career advicefinto the curriculum

‘through the purposeful (ie with

advising in mind) development of
the Freshman Program, the 80’s
courses, introductory seminars in
each of the majors, and through
coordinated efforts among the ma-
jor areas (far short of new pro-
grams) to demonstrate those points
of contact andirelationship, those
cluster areas, in the vast array of
1200 courses in the CAS curricu-
lum. I

But these are all suggestions for
moderate change. There remains,
of course, the possibility of radical
restructuring of the undergraduate
program at Pitt. I will suggest that
in the final article in this series.

Robert Marshall is Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences.

Letter to the Editor r

Liberal Arts
And Teaching”, , _

Dear Sir:

Dean Robert Marshall's essay on
liberal education in the October 16
Pitt News is part of a continuing
debate that has been taking place
at this university. A

He praises the ﬂexible outlook of a
liberal arts graduate. I hope he
didn’t intend the suggestion that
liberal arts students ought to avoid
learning skills. ‘

He remarks that most professors

are professionals. therefore they.

have not themselves experienced
the flexible career development

 
  
  
 

it is paradoxical that professionals,

people who are highly skilled
practitioners in a specialty, should
be teachers for students whose
interests are general.

Does Dean Marshall mean to
convey the message that because
most university teachers are
professionals, therefore most uni-
versity teaching is somehow
suspect? Does he have reason to
believe that this pedagogical theory
correctly describes conditions at
Pitt, and that the quality of CAS
teaching will improve if the
percentage of professors who
practice what they
reduced? '
‘Surely, practitioners bring stu-
dents skills and attitudes that make

joined shortly afterwards by Pro-
vost Rhoten Smith.

In a separate incident. a dele-
gation of an estimated 30 black
students gathered in Rosenbergs
office and proceeded to escort
him downstairs to the Chancel-
lor‘s office. where protesters
were already confronting Coble.
Powers and Smith.

The mood of the confrontation
was tense. as all the participants
remained standing the full four
hours in the warm. dimly lit
room. Although there were sev-
eral outbreaks of shouting. there
was no danger or threat of vio-
lence.

Many black leaders said it was
not a matter of Curtiss Porter vs.
Roland Smith — although Porter
clearly was the favorite — but

rather a matter where the black V

community should determine’ the
direction of the department.

“We are fighting for the right
of self-determination.“ Swilley.
the BAS chairperson told the of-
ficials. "We are the guardians of
the department. People who truly
understand the problems and idio-
syncrasies of the department
should make the decision. If we
want Joe Blue to be chairman. it
should be Joe Blue.“

The issue of self‘-determination
was raised several times during
the course of the confrontation.
which left most of those involved
.perspiring. but the administra-
tion never responded and during a
break. Rosenberg declined com-
ment. -

The immediate concern of the
protesters, before demanding that
the decision to name Smith be re-
versed and Porter to be appointed
instead, was to learn why the de-
cision had been made.

After being asked the question
many times in the course of the
meeting. Rosenberg told the

group he would not evaluate Por-
ter publically.

"I don't want to downspeak
Curtiss." Rosenberg said. “I
don‘t want to say that Curtiss
Porter does not have the qualifi-
cations. I have respect for Cur-

'tiss. He has a big contribution yet

to make to this community."

Before Rosenberg arrived, how-
ever, Powers responded to the
same question.

“One cannot be appointed un-
less he has the full confidence of
the Dean IRosenbergl." Powers
said. “A chairman speaks with
the full authority of the Dean.
You cannot appoint two people. so
you must choose the one in which
you have the most confidence."

The lengthy discussion. which
centered on Rosenberg and sever-
al black students and faculty
members who fed him questions.
dealt with two crucial questions-
ll what wasthe criteria for Ros-
enberg’s decision. since Porter.
not Smith. had the support of the
black community. and 2: would
the decision be reconsidered.

At first, Rosenberg said he
would not reconsider. “There
comes a time when a decision has
to be made,” he said. But‘-later,
after being prodded by the large
crowd, the FAS Dean said he
would consider thematter under
different circumstances. Going

further, he eventually agreed to.

notify Roland Smith, who is a pro-
fessor at Carnegie-Mellon, that

theimatter was under reconsider- ‘

ation.

Nearing the dinner hour. when
it appeared that Rosenberg may
not agree to a compromise. the

"black congregation became some-

 

 ' ‘

; ..\_

what divided as to the means of
achieving their goal—to get Por-
ter named chairman.

Although it was never made ex-
plicit. it seemed some students
would have preferred to maintain
a demonstration until the deci-
sion was reversed. while others.
headed by faculty member Reg-
gie Sevayega. bidded the group to
simply receive from Rosen-
berg "a commitment to reassess-
ment.

“I don’t want to see a return to
the 60’s,” Sevayega said. “This
is a political struggle. It is more
important to win than. to sound
good. You can win the skirmish,
but lose the battle. I’ve learned
to have patience."

Soon after Sevayega's plea.
black students caucused outside
the Chancellor's office and reen-
tered the reception room with
the demand to Rosenberg. cou-
pledvwith his other agreements.
that he advise the Chancellor to
meet with a delegation ‘of the
group to consider the issue.

_During the break. Coble. an
aide to the Chancellor. said he
was completely surprised by the
student activism and that. he had
underestimated their concern.
But neither Coble nor Rosenberg
would speculate as to the resolu-
tion to the problem.

Swilley. during the confronta-
tion. told Rosenberg that Roland
,Smith would not be accepted as
chairman. and that the decision
must be changed by any means
necessary. After the protest. she
repeated the struggle would not
end until Curtiss Porter was ap-
pointed chairman.

There are also questions on whe-
ther or not records should be made

one of the key issues of “Campaign

so that a 25% instead of a 50% vote

The questionnaire is being distri-
buted to all candidates, in all

of Common Cause.,Results will be

Common Cause is a national
non-partisan citizens lobby which
neither supports nor opposes can-
didates for election.

Since -its conception in 1972,
Common Cause has been responsi-
ble for several legislative bills and
investigations. Perhaps the best
known is the investigation of the
Committee :for the Re-election of
the President (CREEP) which re-.
sulted in mandatory disclosures of
all campaign contributors.

According to John Gardner, the
originator of the idea, Common
Cause is necessary. “Unless you
get at the capacity of money to buy
political outcomes and at the
secrecy which makes it possible,
you've missed it all. That’s the
point at which the system is placed

at the disposal of ‘the monied.

interests."

The Sensuous Belly -Dancer

BY LYNN SCHEIDHAUER

The sound of gold coins hitting
flesh. The whirl of sheer red
chiffon. Hips beating triple time.

Bel-sha-zaar is a belly dancer.

Shazar teaches belly dancing at
Spas and YMCA‘s in the tristate
area. In her spare time she
performs at the Zorba Club in the
South Side. '

"1 never learned to belly dance,"
Bel-sha-zaar said. “It's part of
my heritage. I'm part Arabic, part
Hebrew.

“Belly dancing is like a folk dance
-- you just know how to do it.”

Like a folk dance,
dance, too.

“The men do the same types of
movements -- wiggling hips and
all,“ Bel-sha-zaar said. “Only the
men are teasing the women. This
type of dance, shefeltie, is per-
formed at all our social events.
Even women in their 80’s belly
dance."

Belly dancing was the first dance
men ever did. It began before the
time of Christ. .

“It was originally performed for-

queens, not kings," Bel-sha-zaar
said. “It began in Egypt and
spread to Turkey and then Greece.

“All dances we have today were

‘taken from the belly dance.

/3.

’ not

“Belly dancing is not a sex dance.
It’s really an art. The strip teasers
copied some steps of belly dancing
and now everyone thinks belly
dancing is obscene.” ,

The dance is not intended to be
sexy, but sensuous. Every move-
ment is graceful, enhancing the
woman's body. Belly dancing does
incorporate the
movements of ballet or the frenzied
shaking of strip tease. Instead,
movement is natural.

“Most of my students are sur-
prised at how pretty the dance is
and how much fun it is," Bel-sha-
zaar said. "I had one woman who

men belly '

stiff strict ’

was going on 82 take lessons to
rejuvenate herself. Everyone
thought she was crazy. But she got
a boyfriend out of it."

Classes start out with a 15 minute
warm-up. Then they work on dance
movements from the head down.
Gradually, every part of the body is
used. Shazar then teaches students
a dance using the movements they
just learned.

“The dance doesn't make you lose
weight," Bel-sha-zaar said, "it
redistributes it. If you practice
every day, within a year you'll
increase your bustline by three
inches. It also takes away double
chins'and keeps the muscles in
tone."

Bel-sha-zaar not only teaches her
students how to dance, but also
teaches how to make the costume.

"‘I make all by costumes,” Bel-
sha-zaar said. “They can cost
anywhere from $15 to $1,000,
depending on the material and trim
used.”

The woman wears a halter-type
bra hand sewn with coins, beads,
or sequins. The heavy belt worn
across the hips is sewn with similar
trimmings. The skirt is two panels
of chiffon or other sheer fabric
which will flow when the hips

'shake.

The man's costume is not as
revealing. They wear wide 'panta-
loon-type pants, j.bell-sleeved
shirts, and sashes around their
waists. Men use the dance to tease
their girlfriends.

But what can belly dancing do for
you? ‘

“I had "one woman take lessons
because she was bored. Her hus-
band was always out of town on

business. She didn't tell him she
was taking lcssons.- One night she
walked into the room wearing her
costume and started dancing. He
wouldn't let her finish. He practic-
ally tore her clothes off. And a
week later he bought her a two and
a half karat diamond ring. He said
it_was worth every penny,"Shazar
said.

“Another woman had been mar-
ried 10 years and thought her
marriage was breaking up. After a
few lessons she danced for her
husband and now everything's
fine. He said somethingwas lack-
ing in their marriage and her
dancing filled in the gaps.

“Many women are inhibited a-
bout their their bodies. They
become a lot looser after belly
dancing. It teaches women’ to be
sensuous.”

In order to tell women about belly
dancing. Bel-sha-zaar is planning a
television show beginning some-
time in November.

“We'd have 15 minutes of dance
and .15 minutes of question -
answer where women can actually
call us," Bel-sha-zaar said.

The show will also feature stu-.
dents from her belly dancing class.

Belly dance lessons aren't expen-
sive. Members of the Spa. pay $20
for eight lessons. Other places offer
classes at similar prices.

"The price is definitely worth it,’,'
Bel-sha-zaar said, “because belly

dancing makes me feel more like a
woman."

-MUSEUM OPENS

BY JAN LLOYD
James M. Walton, President of
the Carnegie Institute and Library,
so introduced the new Sarah Scaife
Gallery to the press-last week. Due

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
 
  

to open to the public on October 26,
Walton remarks, “Carnegie Insti-
tute is now two museums." Indee
it is. ‘ V 3

The Institute, with the completion
of the Sarah Scaife Gallery now

"encompasses the Museum of Na't- -

ural History and the Museum of
Art. Initially a gift to thegcity ‘of

Pittsburgh from Andrew Carnegie‘

in the latae 1800’s, the building has
now seen completion of they only
expansion that. has occurred since
1907. “We are now a‘ full-fledged
museum” claims Leon A. Arkus,
Director {of the Museum of ‘Art.
The opening of the'Sarah Scaife
_ Gallery‘ makes Carnegie Institute
and Oakland the center of Pitts-
burgh cultural life. Edward Barnes,
architectrof the ‘Gallery comments
‘that the! Emerald Pearl granite
structure is “pleasa-nth,’ hospitable
and friendly, a people‘-oriented"
museum.'Not only is it a--‘treasure
house of its own but it is also part of
the whole Carnegie Institute com-
plex." ' S
’ The building certainly is one
designed with man in mind. Its
large, ‘ white, primarily natural-
lighted galleries make viewing the

art a definite pleasure. Skylights in '

major sections of roofing give an
ample lighting supply to the top
floor galleries. As James Walton
aptly puts it. “Ed Barnes has given
us a work of art that works."

The first addition of art to the
Museum's permanent collection

' intended specifically for the Sarah ’

Scaife Gallery is the work entitled
“Free Exchange" by the French
artist Jean Dubuffet. The acrylic‘
work is a seven piece combination
of painting and sculpture with
motorized, movable parts. "We
had some trouble making sure that

the pieces wouldn't coilide," com- _

merits Charles Cathey. Museum of
Art Registrar. It will be seen for the
first time by the public at the
preview oening of the Gallery.
The special exhibition entitled

“Celebration” by Arkus will be on
display in honor of the Galler/'y’s
opening. The paintings in this
special exhibit were gathered from

V galleries" throughout Eurgpe and

the United States ‘and includes
work which begins with the Pre-
Impressionists and continues with
art from various movements up
until 1950. 0  _ '
V“Celebration' is a very exciting
and aptly named exhibit featuring
the works; of Manet, Renoir,'Cas-

satt, To/ulouse-Lautrfec, van Gogh.

Guggenheim Museum. The Phila-
delphia Museum of Art and the
Cleveland Museum of Art.

The $12.5 million Gallery will host
a great deal of activity during the
week, scheduling an opening for
Gallery and Institute ‘staff on
Tuesday October 22, an opening
for Institute members on Friday,
October 2S,-and the publice open.-
ing on October 26 and 27. -“From
the first germination of the idea it's
taken ten years." maintains Leon-
Arkus, “but by golly." he exclaims
“we have a building!" ,

The Gallery is a gift by the Scaife
Foundation and the Scaife family to
the city of Pittsburgh in honor of
Mrs. Sarah Scaife. The Museum's
permanent collection will be
housed there. This collection con-
tains. ,many major Impressionist
and Post-Impressionist paintings

' galleries are presently under reno-

yivation to accomplish this transfer.

even Dayadip Carlos Santana) ties

Springfield. As seasoned players,
John David Souther, Chris Hill-
man, and Richie Furay needed
something more ambitious. The
new group satisfied those needs
and they named it_ simply...The
Souther, Hillman, and Furay Band.

Now complete with pedal steel
guitarist, Al Perkins’ keyboard
player, Paul Harris, and drummer,
Jim Gordon, Souther, Hillman and
Furay have built a band that lives
up to their separate heritage.

‘ BY HARRIS LEVY

ORISON: PANIC CEREMONY
(Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre)

GARDEN OF DELIGHTS by
Fernando Arrabal 88 pp., New
York: Grove Press, $2.95
(paperback) . '

What do dozens of red balloons, a
giant-size penis, "and the Bible have
in common? They’re all part of the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre‘s
production of Fernando Arrabal’s
Orison: Panic Ceremony.

Orison: Panic Ceremony juxta-
poses several distinct settings and
groups of charcters which merge
for the final, climactic scene. Two
women, one dressed in black, the
other in white, sit on opposite ends
on a huge jungle-gym style
apparatus and discuss the Bible
and Good and Evil. Their‘ past

.malevolence and an unappetizing

vision of Heaven are also mention-
ed..

On the stage level, a nun and her
communicant talk. about marriage‘
and housekeeping. Billy Royston,
who was responsible for the
production’s conception, has ima-.
ginatively extended the area in
which their scenes are played to,
include the floor where the
audience would usually be seated.

' The nun tells the communicant that

the only way to get and keep a
husband is by slavish devotion to
household chores.

The third type of scene involves a
character labeled “the Necro-
phile.” While the nun and
communicant watch with speech-
less horror, he mimes l'ewd

gestures as he roams over the floor.
Attired in a. dark overcoat and
equipped with an exposed giant
penis that is larger« with each
successive appearance, (his in-
creasingly agitated and explicit
gestures culminate in copulation in l

a coffin.

The final scene blends necro-
philia, murder, and liberation of
feelings with the use of all the

character, strobe lights and the red

balloons. _
Orison: Panic Ceremony 1S
saturated with symbolism. The

nun's discourse on the necessity for
meticulous housekeeping exempli-
ties the Chtirch’s stiﬂing nature.
For Arrabal, violence releases
suppressed feelings in the nun and
the communicant.

Also, violence is the natural end
product of human nature. For the
nun, it releases her_ true nature as

she flings off her habit to reveal a '

bikini. The discourses of the two
characters perched on the metal
construction augments Arrabal’s
depiction of the _church’s detri-
mental effects.

Arrabal’s questionable. view of
human relations does make for
engrossing theatre. And the
production of the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre matched Ar-
rabal’s inventiveness.
dience was seated on the side of the
floor as the large open area was

used by the nun, the communicant —

and- the necrophile. Startling
effects and symbolic costumes
make Arrabal’s bizarre play con-
tinuously engrossing.

The performers conveyed Ar-
rabal’s conception of humanity
successfully: Jim McCue as the
necrophile was memorable with his
splayed hands and nimble cavort-

ing (his sleazy overcoatland hat ’

were appropriate.) Jenny J. ‘Arn-
heim and Lillian Downing were
suitably unemotional as the women
discussed God. The nun was vividly
portrayed by Laurel Clendenning
with stem grimacingyand angry,
bulging eyes. And Florence Nakao
as the communicant was a good foil
for McCue-——her bland naivete
contrasted with his vibrant earthi-
ness. . ' _
Arrabal’s plays are expressions of
his theory, the “Theatre of Panic”
which unites “the fantasies of Don
Quixote, the nightmares of Alice,
the _ anxieties of K, and the
humanoid dreams that haunt the
night of IBM machines.” ‘ t .
Bosch, Goya and’Brueghel paint-
ings. Masochism and sado-
masochism. Fantastic powers to
see the past and the future--and
nine sheep. All are elements of the
Garden of Delights, Arrabal’s'most

Dave Mason and the Melons at
Syria Mosque/ Oct. 20:

Not expecting it, but thoroughly
enjoying it after the fact, Dave
Mason’s back-up band warmed up.
the audience with a superb and
often moving set. Doing tunes by
the members themselves (Mike
Finnigan——keyboards, Jim Krue-
ger——guitar, Bob Glaub—bass and
Rick Jaeger—drums) was impres-
sive enough for the moment, but
being relieved they weren’t weak
ones was enough to set the evening
for_Dave.

’,.

And there he was. When he
picked up the acoustic 12 string, I
kinda knew what he was gonna
do...“Can’t stop lovin’ you...” and
that set us up for 'a tremendous
punchline that went: “Just A
Song,” “Every Woman,” “Head-
keeper” and ended with “Gimme
Some Lovin’.”

Mixing the set with old, new and
relatively new (has it been that long
since lt’s Like You Never Left?) and
bringing the tempo down at the
right times. “Pearly Queen” was
as good as ever and_ I almost
expected to see Winwood, Capaldi

COUPLINGS AND GROUPINGS
by Megan Terry .

190 pages New York:Avon Books
$1.45 (paperback)

“People are equally interesting,
they are equally valuable, equally
important. So you live with'this
feeling that anything [you say is
going to be listened to,” says a
woman in Couplings and Group-
ings. , i '

Playwright Megan Terry listened,
and recorded the views of a
cross-section of Americans: men
and women, young and old, black
and white, heterosexual and
homosexual. In this sampling of
“changing attitudes toward tradi-
tional marriage,” Terry found that
people “are still plagued with the
same old problems.” 7

The author lets her subjects speak
for themselves and their engaging
personalities come across in the
comments on families, marriage,
love, and sex. But the lack of
analysis prevents Couplings and

and Wood on stage, but like Dave
said “Here’s an old one...ﬁve
years or so. Boy I'm getting to be
an old man.” .

It is hard to believe that Traffic, in
it's original form, has been
deceased that long. With that time

behind him he used all the talent,

he’s been storehousing since Alone
Together to completely let loose
with this new band.

Working smoothly, and yet
knowingly, very tightly together
Dave Mason and the Melonsiper-
formed with an ease that soothed
the fans and excited them at the

Groupings from reaching its full
potential. A '

I saw one of the Bob Dylan and the

most who were there, I’m not going

Knockin’ On Dylan’s Door con-

tains Rolling Stone’s coverage of '

Dylan at the Georgia Governor’s

comments from Los Angeles
spectators like Joan Baez and
Warren Beatty; an interview with
Dylan and 24 pages of photo-
graphs.

Contributions by Rolling Stone
regulars are supplemented by
pieces from Michael McClure, Nat
Hentoff, and Ellen Willis evalua-
ting Dylan’s inﬂuence. Not really a
signiﬁcant addition to rock criti-
cism, it should interest the

Ohio State Still Tops

HERSCHEL NISSENSON
AP Sports Writer
The California Golden Bears who
have had only three winning
seasons in 15 years cracked The
Associated Press college football

ranking for the first time this

season.

Cal sneaked into the No. 20
position by winning its ﬁfth game
in a row last weekend following a
four point opening game’road loss

Meanwhile, the first eight
teams, led by No. 1 rgnked Ohio

things settled down last week
following four upset jammed week-
ends.

California replaced Kansas in the‘

.Top Twenty. The Jayhawks, 13th

last week, dropped out in the wake
of a 56-0 rout at the hands of
Nebraska. That triumph lifted
Nebraska from 12th to ninth, ahead
of Penn State, climbed from
11th to 10th by beating Syracuse
30-14. -

Ohio State remained on _top for the
ﬁfth week in a row with a 49-9 rout
of lndiana. The Buckeyes received
50 ﬁrst place votes and 1,196 of a
possible 1,210 points from a nation
wide panel of sports writers and
broadcasters.

Oklahoma’s 49-14 trouncing of '
Colorado earned the Sooners eight

“What do you think of Temple

mentator Myron Cope, in his usual

cranky voice, of Johnny Majors‘

yesterday at the weekly press
luncheon. H

“Well, anybody who’s thinking

Boston College and a pair of

“We’re all human and sometimes

was quite a different story as
George Welsh’s crew turned the
game around and pushed the
Panthers all over the field.

It took a long drive in the ﬁnal
minute of play to save Pitt and that
is one game Majors will not forget.

“The serviceiacademies always
play with pride," Majors
remarked. “No matter which one
you’re playing and no matter what
their record might be, you just
can’t overlook them.’_'

Concentration on elaboration is
Majors’ present dilemma, after two
successive weekends of pleasing
performances from his squad. And
that doesn’tJmean Elliot Walker
will be starting alongside Tony
Dorsett and Billy Daniels will be
directing a veer offense. Not yet,
anyway. '

“Certainly we’re going to try and
elaborate on our offense,” Majors
shrewdly stated. “But right now

we’re at the point of just getting

some people back and healthy.
Elliot Walker just came back from
some nagging muscle pulls and
Bob Hutton’s done a fine job
starting for Dave Janasek on very
short notice.”

Janasek should be ready to go
against Navy, but Walker came up
with another hamstring pull in the
Boston College encounter. And
with the recent revitalization of

’ Dorsett, Majors seems reluctant to

2'

at least rhetorically eleborateon
any deﬁnite personnel changes.
With both the offense and the
defense looking so good in the past
two weeks, he can only praise his
players for ﬁnally getting into gear.

“Bill Daniels was voted by the
team as the Defensive playmaker, of
the week against Boston College
for keeping the ball out of our end
of the field,” said Majors. “The
offense has done a great job of
holding onto the ball. That was a
very serious problem in the
beginning of the season.”

The resurrection of the passing
game by Daniels has rivaled the
running of Dorsett. Once doubted

JOHNNY MAJ ORS

as a passer, Daniels has dispelled
those rumors by connecting on 20
of his last 33 attempts in the past
two games without an interception.

The Daniels to Farmer combina-
tion on the bomb has added a
deﬁnite weapon to the Pitt arsenal,
keeping opponents’ secondaries
honest.

“I’ve never seen better execuﬁﬁ

on the passes from Daniels to, ' ‘  I

Farmer,” Majors said. “It's tousgli
to hit a man in stride and it’s a
credit to Farmer for holding onto
the ball.”

Majors continued to heap ac-
colades on his troops, singling out
the always consistent. wingback
Bruce Murphy, tight end Jim
Corbett, who was the downfield
blocker of the week for sprin ' *1‘,
Dorsett on his first long run, a 3‘

connected on a block almost 20
yards downfield to assure Dorsett
clear sailing on his second sprint

though the week’s player-guests

Pitt, Team To Beat In   WPIHA  

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Western Pennsylvania In-
tercollegiate Hockey Association
(WPIHA) opens its fourth season of
play November 24, with Pitt once
again the team to beat.

The only team ever to win the
WPlHA’s Commissioner’s Trophy,
Pitt will defend against the likes of
Camegie-Mellon, Duquesne, lndi-
ana State, Penn State-McKeesport,
St. Vincents and St. Franciswho
will vie to keep Pitt’s success from
becoming a perennial affair.

Pitt’s rivals, however will ﬁnd the
going tough. They must contend
with the league’s top scoring line of
Rick Vernon, a sophomore, and
seniors Charlie Hagins and Denny

' Browne. If that is not enough, the V

Panthers boast the WPlHA’s top
goaltender in senior John DeFazio
(0.88 goals against average and
five shutouts).

If Pitt lacks anything at all, it is
depth. Coach Len Barcalow's club
shows only seven players with

previous .WPIHA experience. But_

with All-Stars like,Vernor_i, Hagins,
and: Browne", A O

  
  

j‘ the :P,a._r11'il‘I,e1‘,S.’_',',.only‘ 1 ,

problem may remain unnoticed.
Camegie-Mellon, finishing only
two points behind Pitt last year in
the league standings, may find it
difficult to match their 1973-74
performance. The Tartans, the only

- team to beat Pitt last season, lost to

the Panthers, 5-3, in the champi-
onship play-off game.

Gone are top goal-getter Peter
Davies and the WPIHA’s All-Star
goalie Jeff Hart (2.46 GAA, 2 SO).
But Mike Kenworthy, a senior
standout, is back and will center a
line with junior Mike Galloway at
the left wing and Matt Goldsmith, a

graduate, on his right side. Junior ‘

Frank Sciulli will take over the
goalkeeping chores.

A major weakness of the
Duquesne Dukes this season will
be inexperience. With a squad
containing eight freshmen, Coach
Andy Barbe. himself a veteran of
the American Hockey League and a
brief- stint with the Toronto Maple
Leafs, must rely on junior holdover
Tim Boylan, his top scorer,“ and a

Veterans Ken Glinka, in goal, and
defenseman Jeff Fondl are key

players. The Bearcats’ only Iosses_
from 1973-74 proved costly. Gone

are All-Star center Len Hohenfeld
and defenseman Joe Doerr, who
transferred to Maine. .
Returning to the WPIHA after a
year’s absence are the St. Francis
Frankies under Coach Jerry Corle,
who has the demanding task of
rebuilding a team which played but
two exhibition games last season.
Bob Zahuraki (center), Ed Chud-
kowski (left wing), and Bill Pfeiffer
(defense) are bright spots on St.
Francis which lacks size among
other things. Goaltending remains
up in the air with freshman Dave

candidates for the position.

’What does an ex-pro football

A  lege in Empiria, Kansas, Leahy,

string quarterbacking position.
Having two dependable quarter-

l_ Joe Gilliam already drafted and

showing promise, Leahy became

He found himself in Frank Sina-

Leahy found himself looking for a

"I met coach Majors and he
offered me the job. I guess I was in

Leahy said.

After Pitt, ‘another coaching job,

to eventually end up on a varsity
staff."

Being 27 years old can be a
handicap to coaches whose players
are only eight or nine years
younger. This is not the case at
Pitt, however.

“I have gained their respect, I
think,” said Leahy, “not by saying
‘respect me’ but by example.”

His words are echoed by freshman
Jim Buoy. ’

“It doesn't matter how old you
are...just so you know what you're
talking about. I can look up to
him."

No matter how good of a coach a
man is, he still needs backing from
the administration. At Pitt, conf‘-
dence is flowing in the JV program.

“Pitt is stressing JV football. It
gives the younger players a chance
to play," Leahy said.

So much emphasis is placed on
the Cubs that other less developed
JV teams, such as West Virginia,
wouldn't even put Pitt on their
schedule. ,

The JV team is important in
shaping a younger player to fit the
varsity mold.

“It's the same as varsity. We use
the same plays, and practice with
the varsity." said Buoy.

Gentleman Johnny came up with
another “_blue chipper" when he
recruited Bob Leahy to take com-
mand of the Junior Varsity. His
record proves it. So far this year,
the Cubs are undefeated.

Yanks Trade Mercer

BY HAL BOCK
AP Sports Writer
New York AP — Baseball’s inter-
league trading period got off to an
impressive start Tuesday when the
New York Yankees sent Bobby
Mercer to the San Francisco Giants
for Bobby Bonds in an exchange of
two of the game's biggest stars.
The two outfielders, but perennial
All Stars, went in a one for one

swap negotiated during the play-

offs and World Series.

Both Bonds and Murcer struggled
through off seasons in 1974.

Bonds batated .256 with 21 hom-
ers, 71 runs batted in and 41 stolen
bases. That was a drop from .283,
39 homers and 96 RBIs in 1973.

Murcer hit .274 last season, a
drop of 30 points from .304 average
in 1973. He also fell from 22 home
runs in 1973 to 10 last season and
from 95 RBIs to 88.

Both players are 28 years old-,
have been ‘major league regulars
for six full seasons and earn more
than $100,000. And both are con-
sidered to be top performers.

“We must have talked with the
Giants 20 times in arranging the
trade," said Gabe Paul, president
of the Yankees, who announced the
deal.

At first the Giants were looking
for a_ pitcher and Bonds was

. e"‘
To Glants For Bonds

-2 .

rumored to be the bait in a deal that
would bring Steve Carleton to San
Francisco. “I don’t thing they
seriously considered that,” said
Paul.

When the Yankees entered the
talks the Giants were still after a
pitcher. Their target was
Medich, who emerged as the ace of
the New York club’s staff last
season.

“I told them we were not going to

trade Medich," Paul continued..‘,‘_‘j§»
“At one point, frankly, I didn’t’

know what it would take to get
Bonds. They wanted a pitcher and I
didn’t think we could afford to give
one.”

When Murcer’s name entered the
converstaion, ‘Horace Stoneham,
owner of the Giants perked up.‘
“Horace likes Murcer and he
wantd a left handed hitter,” said
Paul.

The Yankees have set their sights
on a’ right handed hitter and hoped
to add some speed during the off
season. They fulfilled both those
targets with Bonds, one of base-

‘. .

ball’s best base stealers.  ‘~‘§,

“There’s one basic rule to follow-I
when you’re making trades,” said
Paul. “You set an objective and
stick to it. Our objective was to get
a right handed hitter with power.
Bonds fills the bill.”
