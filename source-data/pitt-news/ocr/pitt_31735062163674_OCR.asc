man named Lewis- Eliot. He has published eight of these ten
or more linked novels that will comprise’ a panorama and in-
terpretatian of British life from 1914 to the present.
In addition to his fame as a best-selling novelist, ‘Snow
.has also gained recognition in the scientific world. At the.
age of 25, he was elected a fellow at Cambridge for his
accomplishments as a molecular physicist and late_r be-
came editor of the Cambridge Library of Modern Science.

In 1943, he was made Commander of the British Empire,
and in 1957, he was knighted. Still, he prefers to call himself
now (he is a Ph.D.) but simply

Speaks at Cambridge

In 1959, he delivered a Rede
lecture at Cambridge, which he
named The Two Cultures.
Speaking as both a (novelist and
~a scientist, he discussed the gap

and the humanities and its pos-
sible effects upon our genera-
tion.

The ﬁlm and lecture indicated;
that Siamese twins, occuring once?

a great rarity, and pointed out‘

that techniques of separation’ have
now been developed to the point

where surgeons are able to put‘

them to use.

Over 350 undergraduate stu-_-:

fessors attended the lecture, which
was sponsored by Alpha Epsilon

Panhel Honors

Pledges at Ball N

Friday Night

' Panhellenic Association is cen-
tering this year’s Panhel Ball
around the new sorority pledges,
according to Susan Canter, Pan-
hel president. The Ball will be
held this Friday from 9 p.m. to
midnight at Webster Hall Hotel.

A Panhel pledge queen will be
chosen for the evening from
among the 13 girls representing
each sorority’s pledge class.

“It will be like a Maypole pull,”
Miss Canter explained. “Each of
the. representatives will be called
out to take hold of a ribbon. The
one who pulls the winning ribbon
will be queen and will be given a
bouquet of roses.”

Pledge Class Recognized

As the representative from each
sorority is introduced, the entire
pledge class will stand and be
recognized. Every pledge attend-
ing the dance will be» presented
with a corsage of white‘ carna-
tions. -

The ball is being held earlier

¢independent Republic of Formosa

through the principle of self-de-

termination of the peoples.” The ‘ _'-

group opposes dictatorship, wheth-
er it be Chinese Nationalist or.
Communist. ‘

In his article Newman expresses V

his “complete agreement” with the
objectives of the organization. He

concerns himself with the four .

pillars of Nationalist support in
the United States. '
Basically American

The forces,‘ all of which are
basically American, _
“Luce ‘empire of Time-Life-For-
tune magazines; the .Hamilton
Wright Organization, hired as pro-
fessional. public relations "experts
to tout the Nationalist cause; the

amorphous but wide-spread group 

of former Christian missionaries
in China; and the Committee ‘of
One Million Against the Admis-
sion of Communist China.”

Newman shows how the four
forces have fostered misconcep-_\
tions about Chinese Nationalists,
chiefly Chiang-Kai-shek,’
through communication media.
Henry R. Luce, “‘:-. personal,

friend ar.d loyal supporter” of 9

chieﬂy Chiang-Kai-Shek,
to make Chiang the ‘George
Washington of China. This is
hard to swallow since there has

- been no national election since

1948 and Chiang himself as-
.sumed a third. term by disre-
garding the constitutional lim
itation of two. I
The idea that Chiang is also
a staunch American ally is refuted
by Newman. He explains that as
those who have read Chiang’s-

book China’s Destiny ‘kn o w, he ‘

“harbors a vast amount of anti-
U.S. and anti—Western bias.” But
Chiang’s image was whitewashed

by the Hamilton Wright Organic _
zation’s $300,000 public relations’ .-

job which Chiang paid for him-
self. Through his efforts un-by-
lined stories praising the Chiang
regime were published throughout
the United States.
Decries Sympathy ,
Newman decries the sympathy‘
afforded to Chiang for his conver—
sion to Christianity and marriage
to a Christian wife. The oppressive
tyranny of the Formosa regime; the;
commitment to force to regain the

mainland; the support of Peking’s‘ 
invasion of India are hardly ac- V

tions which would endear him to;
sincere Christians. ,
The overthrow of the Chiang
regime will be difficult with-.
out American support, but, as
Newman maintains, there is al-.

ways the case of Syngman Rhee, I I

‘No F ine’ Day

The Library department has set

aside next Wednesday as the time
‘ when any overdue books may be

returned to the library with no

_- ﬁne levied.

Participating are the 22nd ﬂoor
social work, ground—level open
stack and ﬁfth floor libraries.
Overdue books may be taken to
these libraries or the Book De-
pository between 8 am. and 11
p.m.

In the past an entire week,
known as Forgiveness Week, was
designated for ,the same purpose.
However, the library department

 decided that a singleday at this

time would better serve the pur-
pose. ‘
Change Explained
The change was explained by
Mrs. Katheryne Y. Mellino, ad-
ministrative assistant to the direc-
tor of libraries, who said, “Thisiis
the only forgiveness day this year.
Formerly a student library com-
mittee of Student Government
held a Forgiveness Week, but it
was usually in the waning weeks
of a trimester and the students
were using the books to do term
papers and never bothered to take
advantage of the week to return.
them.” " ' _ 
Mrs. Mallino continued, “Also,
a student would hold overdue
books waiting for the Forgive-
ness Week to arrive. By staging
the day earlier in the trimester,
overdue books are ‘returned
sooner and more students have
-a chance to use them.”
Wednesday is the birthday of
Abraham Lincoln‘. The day was
purposely selected so students
would recognize the “Honest,Abe”
implication, Mrs. Mallino said.

American history in dealing
with the Far East. A close “per-
sona ” tie has been drawn many

"times between the Chinese peo-

ple and Americans. The mis-
sionary movements based in this
country, of whom former Sena-
tor Walter Judd is a prime ex-
ample, have instilled this love
of China’s masses into the warp
and woof of our public’s foreign
policy attitudes. Thus the belief
that China’s Communist regime

policy of avoidance. Throughout
the Soviet Bloc gaps exist in our
knowledge and understanding be-
cause of the closed nature of

these regimes. Nowhere is this
more true than in‘ China, where
estimates about political strength
of the Communists, the decline
or rise in the Chinese economy,
or the possibility of Chinese ac‘-
quireinent of nuclear weapons, are
nothing but estimates. There is
no guarantee th at diplomatic

we should not recognize a regime
who seizes power by force and
terror, does not hold true in prac-
tice for other nations. We have
recognized. governments in all

on the Chinese is best expressed
in the United ‘Nations by our
continued refusal to seat them\un-
til and unless their aggressiveness
is discontinued. Here in the U.N.,
is the place for moral and ethical
pronouncements. But in the harsh
world of s o v e r e i g n survival
against international Communism
our knowledge is severely limited

by the lack of contact with the

key to power in the twentieth

knowledge for our own survival.
We should consider recognizing

opportunity to learn and influence

clearly on the basis '_of the ‘con-

the report indicated that most

cigars or pipes. This ~ indicates ,

thatpeople are vaguely aware of

_,_,,the dangersof lung cancer. But
 people don’t really realize the

pain and misery that cancer
causes.

Several solutions have been
proposed to solve this problem.

- One is simply to ban the sale
of cigarettes. This simply won’t
work. We would have a period

‘like the 20’s with alcohol.

Alcohol, like cigarettes, is
harmful in the excess. When the
Women’s Christian Temperance
Union convinced _ Congress of
this, "we had prohibition. But
this didn’t stop the sale of alco-
hol. Liquor consumption was
still high. Millions were made in
bootlegging.

The same would happen with
cigarettes. They too are harmful
in the excess. If their sale is pro-
hibited,‘it would merely result in
bootleg cigarettes. This wou1dn’t
solve the smoking problem, but
it would make several enter-
prising people very wealthy.

Those who wanted to smoke
would still smoke“, only at a
higher price. Therefore, another
solution is needed. .

People must be constantly
realerted to the dangers of
cigarette smoking. Someone
must educate the people to the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

This is the responsibility of the

federal government. In addi-

tion, the government should dd

something to encourage a sub-

stitute for cigarettes. The solu-
tion, then, is two-fold.

First, the government must

carry on a public service cam-
paign to alert the public to4 the
dangers of smoking.’ _
_’ Second, the government should
place a. tax on cigarettesthat
would make it prohibitive to
smoke them. ’But, at the same
time, the government should
lower the tax on cigars and pipe
tobacco to encourage their con-
sumption in lieu of cigarettes.

The government should re-.

quire that each pack of cigarettes
be labeled as to tar and nicotine
content. In addition to this, a
law should, be passed» requiring
each manufacturer of ‘cigarettes
to print ‘somewhere on the cigar-
ette pack the following words:
“These cigarettes may be
harmful and habit forming if
smoked excessively.”
These same’ words should be

printed in every cigarette ad in‘-

magazines and newspapers, and

stated at the end of each radio"

and television commercial.
In addition to this,
should be , public service an-

nouncements on radio and tele-'

vision showing people the effects
of excessive smoking. Presenting
actual case histories, with pic-
tures of people who are dying of
lung cancer might not have much
effect on the people who are
smokers now, but it could pre-
vent potential smokers from be-
ginning.

The second phase of this solu-
tion is to make the tax on cigar-
ettes so high, that only the rich

could afford, to smoke. This,

.when coupled with a reduced tax '

on cigars’ and pipes, would re-
sult in the promotion of the less-
ers of three evils. If." smokers
want to choose the way they
want to die, the ‘government
might as well make it harder for
them to take the easy way.
Therefore, a law prohibiting
the sale of cigarettes would
not stop people from buying
cigarettes. It would merely V
stop them from buying cigar-
ettes legally. The only way

~ cigarette smoking. can be curb-

ed is through preventing the
non-smokers from ‘beginning,
-through use of the public ser-
'v i c e announcements, _ a n (1
through encouraging cigarette
smokers to switch to cigars- and
pipes. _
Of course, the tax part of the

_ solution won’t have the same ef-

fects on the smoking habits of
women as of men. Maybe the
tax should be a function-of the
cigarette’s tar and -nicotine
rating.

Engr. Student
Feels Slightecl ,

Editor, The ‘Pitt News:

In your editorials concerning
education, "you, failed to mention
engineering education. I know
that the vast majority of Liberal
Arts students, and possibly you
yourself, think that we‘ engineers
are nothing but ignorant slobs.
Nevertheless, I think we have
been slighted.

Most of the engineers at Pitt
are here so that they eventually
will earn a good living. I be-
lieve there is nothing intrinsic-
ally wrong with _the idea of get-
ting ‘a college education for the
purpose of making a better in-
come. It is natural for man to
want to live better, and enjoy
more things. A college education
is one means of obtaining a high-
er standard of living. Surely you
would agree that it is better than
starting a numbers racket or rob-.
bing a bank.

Americans have always tried.
to attain higher standards. Pres- I
ident Johnson, for "example, has
declared a “war on poverty.”
Call this materialism or anything
else, but it is up to the individual
to judge his own actionsand in-
tent in these matters.

It .- is? the -function . of’ the

people with the intent of get-
ting a good job as well as for

those of us who "want to in-
crease their knowledge of the

_world and its ideas. I, for ex- '

ample, have chosen the ﬁeld of
Chemical Engineering. Surely
I will earn a good living in this
ﬁeld, but that doesn’t make me
like it better; nor does it make
me dislike it. '

All knowledge, Mr. Editor, is
not gained ‘through contempla-
tion. One must know a great deal

of facts and processes if he is

going to be an engineer. There is
nothing wrong with taking a
,“How to study”
will facilitate one’s learning of
these facts and processes. It is
up to the individual student to
look beyond this conglomeration
of hap-hazard facts and see the
basic ideas involved. He must
«take time out from his rote

learning to investigate the rea-.

'sons for learning these facts.
This, Mr.‘-Editor, is the reason for
studying ﬁelds which ‘have no
obvious relation to the ﬁeld of
engineering.

If students were not forced to
take courses outside of their own
ﬁeld, how many engineers would
ever take a philosophy-or a his-
tory course? Universities would
not graduate men and women

. who were professionals, b ut

rather, trained machines.

In The Spotlight I

with Stan Schweiger

As a rule I am not a tele-
vision "fan to any great ex-
tent. I watch the sporting
events, and Johnny Carson’s
show is one of the few I
watch with any regularity.

This year, however, I started
to watch a few shows quite reg-
ularly and was quite vehement
in. my praise of these programs.
They are the Judy Garland
show, the Richard Boone show,
and “East Side—West Side.” All
of these programs have. one
thing in common which keeps
them apart from most of the
tripe seen over the airwaves
,these days. That» common item
‘is called originality, and the lack

the mass media is a sickening

reality in our society. Anyway. -

these shows are inventive, fresh,
and different. No pattern or any-
thing tobrand these shows with
a certain stamp. And so I’ve
been entertained very nicely by
these three’ outings.‘

In last 'l‘hursday’s copy of’
Variety and in‘ similar stories
in the newspapers there came
the delightful news that not
one but two of m:, favorite
programs were being .can-
celled effective next season
and that I “East‘:~ Side-West
Side” was c_hanging~it,s format
almost entirely. Judy Gar-
land will be singing “Over the
Rainbow_’’_‘ for the ﬁnal time
on March 12 and Richard
Boone will be applying his
makeup for the last time some

date in April‘. 7

Miss Judy G‘arland’s shows are

‘ built around their great vocalist

who has been in ﬁne fettle on
most of her shows. She-sings

and comedians have done great
jobs in creating a fresh and ex-
citing show on Sundays at 9.

The Richard Boone show at-
tempts to be the only Repertory
Dramatic program‘ in the history
of television and to my mind it
has succeeded beyond belief.
Each week there is a new script
by a new and talented writer
and the cast rises to the new
script every time.

“East Side—West Side” tellsof
-the work of a social worker
played by George C. Scott and
shows various facets of life as
discrimination, religion,_ "narcot-
ics, and sex. The actingpis excel-
lent almost every week" and »Mr.
Scott is one of the ﬁnest talents
around.

Now it seems as if. Miss Gar-
land is not selling the right
amount of "cold. tablets and car-
pets, so the sponsor is handing
out the obituary notice. What is
left for the entertainment fac-
tion of audiences is The Garry
Moore‘ Show and The Ed Sul-
livan Show. I will not_ comment

on those two programs. "I -‘will

“comment on Danny " Kaye's out-
ing, thoughl doubt if he will
see this. Mr. Kaye is an amaz-
ingly talented performer who

has gotten into the hands of a
sponsor and has been stripped
of his originality and spontan-
eity. He joins the list that is
headed so tritel-y by the messers
Moore and Sulli-van.

The fate of the Richard Boone
show should have been forseen
even before, the year began. No-
body wants to see original drama
and comedy, on television. The
people want to, see the doctors,
lawyers and Indian chiefs go
through the same. scripts week
after week and that’s .that.
Brother, is that saying‘ some-
thing for our society, which is
thirsting for the latest creations
from 12-year old Itelewriters.

Anyway, to sum up, we have
seen how the quacks from Madi-
son Avenue have put another
piece of cultural wood into their
ﬁre. They are satisﬁed with the
hi1lbillies,— the .idiot fathers, the
talking horses, and-‘the 6,000 men

drill team. Any bit of newness’

will be burned at the state and
our audiences will walk the
plank of commercials should
they accept something like a
Judy Garland Show or a Dick
Boone program. I

Judging from many of theremarks heard around

team representing this school was a combination of the’

Dartmouth and Muskingum squads.

not aggressive enough; Dave Sauer has seniorities; Cal

Success can’t satify some
people. But even the-most severe
critic of the team will agree that
the hoopsters do a pretty good
job of winning games. They’ve
won eight straight now and take
a 12-4 record to New York this

Sheﬁield is the "only member of the team who has

played on a consistent level throughout the season. The-

rest have been in and out of slumps. The important thing

is that one of the four irregular regulars usually joins 
Shefﬁeld in keeping the team jmoving while the others V.

are cold.

While Generalovich was in ‘a slump prior to, the »
Carnegie Tech game, Roman. picked up Generalovich’s"

share of the scoring. And while Roman wasn’t shooting
well earlier in the season Generalovich was » scoring.
Lately Sauer has come on to play outstanding ball and
help carry the'General’s scoring load.

The team will _not be able to afford inconsistency .»

this weekend at New York. It’s getting‘ close to -tourna-
ment selection time and the Panthers. must do well on
the road to- merit a bid to either the NCAA, or NIT.\.
In addition to playing Syracuse and Fordham
this weekend the Panthers will also play at West
Virginia next Wednesday. They will be in good shape-
tournament-wise if they cantake two of the three
games. If they win ‘only. one of the three games the
tournament chances of the squad will diminish.

While most students here would rather see the team
play in the NIT in New York if they get a bid, that

NCAA, and although athletic director Frank’ Carver
says he will take whichever bid comes ﬁrst, the chances
are very strong that the NIT will not issue the Panthers
a bid if they know the NCAA wants them.

While things have been going well with the basket-

soundly beaten by Michigan last Saturday.

Peery’s biggest trouble is a /lack of depth. He
has to use a 137-pounder at 167-pounds and must call

' on two highly inexperienced men when wrestling

‘heavyweight against Eastern schools.

Chances of 137-pounders Clair Riley or Don Caslow 1

winning at 167-pounds are highly unlikely. The same
holds true for either Bill Beck or George Macko at
heavyweight. ‘Therefore, the Panthers are giving up
six points before the meet starts in most cases. _

There is little Peery can do about this. His only hope
is having strength in other weight classes to counteract
these two weaknesses. The first step in improving" the
team was made last week when Frank O’Korn moved
down from 157 to 137-pounds.

This did cause a glaring weakness at 167-pounds,
as Tom Baily moved from 167 to 157-pounds. But the
important thing is that O’Korn moved down to 137--
pounds, where he ranks as one of the best in the East.

Under the old lineup the Panthers were weak at
137 and 167-pounds. Now they are a little weaker at
167-pounds, but much stronger at 137-pounds.

‘Peery is planning one other lineup change before
the season closes-—probably in time for the tournaments.
Current 177-pounder Lee. Hall, who is one of the best in
the East at that weight class, will move down to_ 167-
pounds, where. he should be even stronger and 191-

Another Ivy League inﬂuence besides
high tuition will be at the University to-
night, as Cornell imeets the Panther

wrestlers at 8 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field‘

House.

Coach Rex Peery says that “it is hard to
sum up our chances against Cornell. They tied
Lehigh and lost to Penn State. However, Lehigh

walloped Penn State. Cornell has a rough squad,
’ though.”

.Mik_e Johnson .and Tom Baily are both get-
ting over. their diﬂiculties and should‘ be ready
for the Big Red matmen-. Johnson had a slight.
touch of the flu which left him too weak to
wrestle against Michigan last Saturday. Baily,
who suffered a slight head injury ., against
Michigan, seems to be none the worse for it.

The 177-pound match shows undefeated Lee

With only.2:58 left in a
game and one team .lead-
ing another by 40 points,
most fans usually start 7

walking toward the exit. But
since the Pitt-Dartmouth game
this year this has not been the .
case. Panther followers are
staying around to see the “two-

kin.

The chant starts on the Pan-
ther bench as it becomes obvi-
ous that Pitt is, going to win.
“It’s. Larkin time” is the saying
and with two or three minutes
left in the game Dink goes in.

“My getting all this publicity
started as a‘ joke with the play-
ers and now the fans have
taken it up,” said Larkin. “Most
"of it has come since‘-the Dart-
mouth game when I took that
35-foot hook,” hesaid. _
Larkin also hit on a jump
shot in that game and com-
mitted two fouls. A week

Larkin said, “I have a good

it's tough to show anything in
two minutes.

Larkin averaged 25 points a

“I’m. not’ bragging,” said
Larkin, “but I had more of-

-I ﬁnally narrowed it down to
Cincinnati and Pitt, but I
wanted to be close tohome so_
‘ I chose Pitt. A guy at George-

Panther coach Bob Timmons

said, “Larkin goes all out, even
in practice. He makes it rough
on the regulars. I wish some
of. them“ would show some of
his aggressiveness more often."

In his three years of varsity
play Larkin has never started
a game or even a scrimmage. “I
guess I don’t ﬁt into the style
of ball they play here,” said

\ Larkin.

,At_the end of his sophomore

' in the spring game among the
players returning next season.
“With‘on1y Cal Shefﬁeld, Grgur-

thought I’d being playing a lot

Larkin‘ said, -“I don’t play

those fouls aren’t intentional,
, but they do stop the clock,
which gives me more time to

 Panther Gymnasts Seek First

There will be two innovations for the

tion, coach Warren Neiger’s performers haven’t
been in the running. Slippery Rock, which is
probably a foe only because of its proximity to
the Pittsburgh campus, can not match the
stature of the regular opposition.

Neiger feels that the use of the old scor-
ing system' will be an aid. He explained the
reason for its use and his thinking about it.
“Slippery Rock‘ is not a member of the Eastern
Intercollegiate Gymnastics League. Therefore,

they do not use our system. In this case, with
our lack of depth, I feel that it’s a break.
“The only thing. that we’ll have to worry
about now is taking as many places as we can.
If we can get a numberof ﬁrsts it should make
up for our shortages.” ~
For the ﬁrst time Neiger feels that his squad
should be favored. This in spite of the fact that
sophomore Bob Davies, an all-around perform-
er, is still an uncertain starter.‘ “If he’s ready
that will help us a great deal,” he said. “But
even if he’s not I still think that we can win.”
In spite of being optimisticvabout tonight,
Neiger’s attitude can not be extended over the
rest of the year. “I don’t really know what,
changes can be made in thefuture,” he stated.
“We still have to make a lot of improve-

In the last two seasons now the Panther
gym team has onlybeen able to come up with
one victory; That was a 57.5-38.5 win over West
Virginia. With this years shortcomings and a
small freshman squad things aren’t looking up.

Following tonight’s contest only Navy, Penn
State, and West Virginia remain as duel com-
petition. In all three cases the new scoring
system.will be reverted to. Right now it appears
that Slippery Rock represents the best chance
for a Panther victory; Tonight may be now or
never, ‘if a winlessrecord is to be avoided.
