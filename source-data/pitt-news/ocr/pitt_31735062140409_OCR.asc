Enrollment Drop

‘S . A Enrollment in the School of Law
~ for the third term dropped to a
A; total of 72 students, Dr. E. A. Gil-

more, dean of the School of Law.
disclosed today.

Last term the enrollment was
123. Dr. Gil-more attributed the
decrease to the fact that 30 men
were graduated this month in the
first February graduating class in
the history of the law school.

The remainderof the decrease
was caused by students withdraw-
ing from the school to enlist in the
armed services and because many
students were called for service by
their draft boards at the expira-
tion o'f the second term, Dr. Gil-

t more said.

“This slight drop in enrollment
here in terms of percent of decline
is among the lowest of any law
school," Dr. Gilmore asserted.

No new students enrolled for the
lthird term.

Dear Mr. Gall:

Four Pitt Students Go To Washington;
Find Confusion, Beauty, Gene Raymond

The inside story on the “Bundles
for Congress” scandal was disclos-
ed to four University students by
Congressman Thomas E. Scanlon,
thirtieth congressional district. The
students were Dorothy Weiner,
C42‘; Robert Sullivan, C43; Harold
Gondelman, C43; and Harry Lang-
er, C42, Pitt “Y” delegates to the
Citizenship Seminar in .Washing-
ton, D. C.

Scanlon was introduced to/the

Pitt representatives, and told them
there had been no quorum when
the measure went through.‘ “The

 ﬁrst  heard ‘o‘f.it,”‘ he stated, “was
   t"t

       
 

met Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the
House, Chairman Vinson of the
House Naval Affairs committee,
and Chairman Summers of the Ju-
diciary committee. They visited the
Departments of Agriculture, La-
bor, Justice, Interior, and the Of-
ﬁces of Education and Civilian De-
fense, and lunched with Scanlon in
the private dining room of the
House of Representatives.

Gene Raymond was as attrac-
tive to Miss Weiner as any Con-
gressman, she said. She spent an
afternoon with the movie star and
another friend, Senator Pepper's
wife. ’

All four

   

     

ever, did not prove -to be quite as
impiessive. “I found them to be
very disappointing,” was the opin-
ion of Miss Weiner. “They aren’t
a-s advanced as we are here.”
The group visited also the Office
of Education, where they inter-
viewed Chester Williams, assistant
to the commissioner in charge of
schools and colleges. “The war on
the college front must be fought
by the students,” he told them. He
felt that students have been too
superior in our attitudes toward
people as a whole and have not
contributed enough to the commu-
nity. ‘

A circus usually runs two days when it comes to Pitts-

circus, the Pitt-Tech basketball games, and toniorrow night
the second pert'ormance goes on in the Kiltie gym.

~.- In the ﬁrst showing of the Carlson—Hannum farce the
Panthers soundly trounced the Plaid quintet 64-34, when
-,Larry Paffrath and Toy Zvlalarkey came through with 18 and

14 points respectively.

Since the first l’utile showing of
the Tartans on the Stadium ﬁorfr,
they have added ‘at player to their
squagl, Wally Patton, who has been
leading the team in their recent
triurnps. Both of them. Patton
wasn’t in school during the lirst
semester, but ‘since joining the
team he has been a high scorer and
a defensive star .:‘‘or the local. High-
land clan.

Teaming? {rip with Patton to give
Tech its udry successful season
(they havélthree wins) has been
Former Allderdice star, Dave Brinn.
Brinn led the Tartans in their first
game with the Panthers as far as
scoring and spirit went. Although
the fight was hopeless he fought to

Blue and Gold now have a fight on

Coach -Carlson feels that the

would defeat Penn State this Sat-

Carlson Proudly Explains
Student "Fatgue Curve"

By ELAINE KAHN A

An interview with l’itt’s Dr. Carl-
son is always stimulating and in-
evitably im"'ormative. At present
the Doctor, who doubles in the role
of basketball coach and head of tlie
Student Health service, is concern-
ed with something called 3. “.t'utigue
curve” and its relation to the stu-
dents‘ and ‘l’acult_v. But then let the
Doctor explain himself:

“It all began,” explains Doctor
Carlson, “last year when, as a re-
sult of frequent charges that has-
kethall was too hard on its play-
ers, the Coaches association dump‘-
ed the problem of proving" or re-
futing the charges in my lap.

“The physical fatigue curve,” he
went on, “is an absolute physio-
logical fact. As you work you tire,
and the faster you work the more
quickly you tire. The fatigue curve
can be looked upon as a triangle.
At the outset you do your best
wo1‘k, but as fatigue sets in, the
quality of your work decreas.es.

“It is a fact that the best: work is
done at the beginning of the school
year when the students are rested,
and that the ' second . semester

Ag)‘-utelevs are lower than in ‘h'1'stse1n-

est.e1'. It is also true that students
pcrf'orm better on Monday, Tues‘-
day, and 'Wednesdz-1y thzm they do
the latter part of the week; Rest
at the low point makes it fpossible
to repeat the regular orderly Fa-
tigue curve. but lack of rest. giv<_>»
<-onﬂised, Lmprcdictable returns.
"At present all Pitt‘ gym classes

are participating in the experi-

ment. Using the standing run at

the ability, thelstudents are ploto 

ting‘ their own fatigue curves.-

“Wc. measure condition by means

of the resp‘onse of the pulse rzzte

()frWOll( and re.’-.'t. In the case of the ' ' i

basketball players we took their,
pulse before they began to play,-
immediately at'terw:iu‘(ls, after‘ two
minutes of rest, four minutes of

rest, and ai'ter six minutesv of rcst.~ D

H’ the })ulS0 rate was normal a’l't:er_.
the two minute rest peiiod the sub-.
ject is co11sidm'e<l to be in ﬁne con-
dition. ‘ '

“Su1~p1'isin_9,-ly enough. our survey.

showed, not thzlt the atliletcs work-
ed too hard, but that they didn’t,
work hard enough. Cmnpzuutively
l'e\v had 2. high measure oi,’ applica-
tion.” ’
y The Doctor L)2UJ.~I.(.‘(l i’o1'b1'eath {nit}
xxcnt on. “It is my hope that this
same system will be applied to
both students and faculty. By‘de-
Voting just one min‘ute each mom-
ing in one class period we can im-
prove both our condition and ap-
plicution. to the task at hand and,
’p’erhaps, olicct a. transl"erence to
other things. A , ‘

“Through hottc.-r physical condi-
tion thus acquired we canhetter
adapt onsrelves to other things he-
cause of our increased emotional’
drive. The teacher supplies the
ﬁlcill. We supply only the physical
condition and emotional drive me‘-
cessary for the better usage of
those skills."

war department revealed last week.

Instead, the military science
course at the University will ex-
tend through the summer, gradu-
ates going immediately into active
duty.

Only a tentative summer sched-
ule has as yet been formed by the

military department to adapt the’
regular 16 weeks course into a‘

shortened 12 weeks session.
Promotions in the cadet corps
and awards of merit for the future

“ have not been decided upon.

The University military science
staff will probably remain intact,
but all present arrangements are
subject to immediate change by the
war department.

Wholesale mid-year changes
were made in the ranks of cadets
of the ROTC last week.

‘ General officers for this sem-
ester are: James Dimel, E42, ca-

[National Physical Fitness’ Program
Is Aim of Civilian Defense Courses

By BETTY Mc'.\IAHAN

Pitt is training men and women
to withstand the strain of air raids.
proﬁting from the experience of
bombed Britons.

Englishmen have discovered that
air raid wardens, plane spotter-s,
first aid helpers and firemen who
took physical recreation were with-
standing the strain of raids better
than others.

In five new courses at Pitt--part
of the Civilian Defense program
for national physical ﬁtness, di-
rected by Dr. Ellwood C. Davis.
head of the department of physi-
cal education-—men and women
are being trained for physical fit-
ness and recreation.

Dr. Davis teaches two of these
courses. “Civilian Defense Pro-
grams of sPhysical Fitness in
Schools and Communities,” is a
cour-se in which programs for
physical ﬁtness are worked out for
schools, industry, and recreation
organizations.

Members of the class, who are
all graduate students or directors
of physical education, work out
the problems of applying these pro-
grams to their communities.

“We are attempting to develop
programs," Dr. Davis said, “that
can be extended after the war, for
there is no reason why a good pro-
gram of physical ﬁtness should
cease at the end of the war.”

Dr. Davis’ second course, “Ad-
vanced Principles and" Techniques
of Teaching," is a continuation of
the first course. This class is at-

Speech Contest
To Begin Today

The ﬁr-st round -of the extcmpo-
raneous speaking contest on inter-
American aﬂ‘.'airs will begin today
in classes in geography, history,
modern languages, political science
and speech. The contest is being
conducted among schools and col-
leges in the tri-state area.

Analyses and suggested solutions
of problems facing the nations of
this hemisphere will be today's sub-
ject. The second round will start
February 20.

Students wishing to participate
who are not in one of the classes
may enter the contest by signing in
1617 Cathedral at 2:30 o'clock to-
morrow. Students who survive to-
day’s eliminations will report in
1617 Cathedral between 2:30 and
4 o'clock Friday.

Eventual rewards in the contest,
after district eliminations and a
ﬁnal national round at Washing-
ton, _D. C., have been conducted,

Swill be trips’ ,to,'Lati,n‘Amgrica.,

tempting to work out, from experi-
ence in physical education, the best
ways to teach these programs.

A ﬁrst aid course for instructors.
taught by Karl Oermann, instruct-
or in physical education, is the third
course in the series. Scheduled for
Wednesday evenings from 6 to 9
o’clock the course includes,stand-
ard, advanced, and instructor’s ﬁrst
aid work.

Mr. Oermann also teaches a
course in acquatic leadership.
Those who complete the course
will be qualiﬁed to teach Red Cross
life saving and, during an emer-
gency, could be of service in water-
front areas.

The fourth and ﬁfth courses in
the series are “Civilian Defense
Programs for Health Education for

Schools and Communities" and
“Analyzing the Child and Physical
Education in a National Emer-
gency.”

The health education course,
taught by Minnie Lynn, instructor
in physical education, is attempt-
ing to formulate programs of health
education which will consider the
problems in co-ordinating health
agencies and provide guidance in
nutritional, emotional, and eco-
nomic problems of individuals
during national emergency.

The analysis course, taught by
Dorothy Deach, instructor in physi-
cal education, considers the “ca-
pacities of the child as well as the
social forces working on the child
during war time and how physical
activities can keep the child so-
cially adjusted.”
