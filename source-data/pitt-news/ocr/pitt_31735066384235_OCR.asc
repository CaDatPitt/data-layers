CAS Council to Act On-

Council voted yesterday to review

requirements and a list of the
courses that he believes fulfills this
purpose.

This is a preliminary step before
the council discusses an ad hoc
committee recommendation that
it appoint a standing committee of
faculty and students responsible
for oversight of the DOS require-
ments.

According to the ad hoc report,
the new committee would, among
other things, develop a deﬁnition of
the rationale and purposes of DOS,
and would review the appropriate-
ness of current 80’s courses,
originally intended to serve as DOS
courses.

“The basic ad hoc proposition is
to establish a committee to work
with department Chairpersons, and
to ask them to deal with the
question of what students should
know before getting a bachelor’s
degree,” CAS Dean Robert Mar-
shall said.

The College of Arts and Sciences
now requires all students to take
three courses in three different
departments in each of the major
divisions of humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences.

SGB Election
Action Begins

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Twelve students have taken out
petitions for seven Student Govern-
ment Board seats, including
president, to be contested in a
campus-wide election in January.

While the list of hopefuls is
expected to grow, the following
persons secured petitions as of
yesterday, the second day forms
were available: Jeff Barent, Ahmie
Baum, Josh Baylson, Judy Berl,
Scott Brown, Stan Galanski, David
Goldman, Dave Hesidence, Jan
Medoff, Sam Mendicino, Todd Park
and Bernie Popko.

Baylson, Berl and Hesidence
currently are serving terms on this
year’s SGB. Baum was elected to a
board seat - last January, but
resigned this summer. A

Students have until Dec. 8 to
return the required petitions to
Student Government with 100
student signatures(15O if they seek
to be president), transcripts, part

Poll Shows Need For Faculty English Competency

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Responses to a recent survey by

ent Government show there is a

f"'j ﬁnite need for an English
“I competency requirement for all Pitt
faculty.

Forty of 41 students responding
to a questionnaire concerning the
English competency of faculty
indicated they had encountered
difﬁculties in courses where the
instructor had a limited. English
vocabulary. Seventeen of those
surveyed said they had, at one time,
withdrawn from a class because of
the instructor's inability to convey
subject matter competently in

There were 21 complaints citing
the math department for using
instructors with inadequate English
speaking ability. The computer
science department followed with
nine votes, and the physics
chemistry and engineering depart-
ments each were cited five or more
times. -

“There is a concentration in the
sciences,” said Student Govern-
ment Board member David Garger,
“but there were complaints about
the English department, too. Those
surveyed don’t just cite one
department; they don’t have a
vengeance for a certain professor. I
think this shows that there is a

deﬁnite need for a requirement.”
Garger said the survey is deﬁnite
proof a problem has been growing
for years at Pitt.
‘ ‘Students ﬁnd it difﬁcult to learn
from a professor who is not
competent in English,” Garger
said. “I’m not talking about a little
accent, I’m talking about a major
difficulty. In fact, Ithink it would be
a good idea for foreign professors to
go through a course on how to
instruct a class in English.
“Professors may be excellent in
their ﬁeld, but, they have to be
understood.” Garger said. “I think
teaching is an important part of
being a professor. That’s what we

pay them for and, if we’re going to
pay them, we ought to be able to
understand them. Ithink it is a duty
of ,the faculty to monitor them-
selves.”

“The problem when you conduct
a survey like this,” Garger said of
the SGB survey, “is that you get a
lot of one-sided opinions from
people who are frustrated with
foreign instructors.”

An individualized approach, with
an interviewer polling a cross
section of the student population,
would have been preferable,
according to Garger. However. it
was impossible to conduct an
extensive survey at this time.

“The student body is lazy,”
Garger said. “Everyone has too
much to do. I would have liked to
see a survey asking students about
the English competency require-
ment personally, but this survey did
show this is a widespread problem
and that students are concerned.
It’s been an issue for years, and I
think it is an issue Student
Government should be involved
in.”

The survey will be presented to
the University Senate Council at its
next meeting, where it will be
discussed and developed further,
Garger said.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

   English Competency

Forty-one responses do not a representative survey make, at least
not at this University. Even so, the fact that 98 percent of the
students who answered a recent Pitt News poll favored an English
language competency requirement for professors should not be

overlooked.

» The biggest problems with spoken English seem to be in the math

and science departments, where research is emphasized.

Not

suprisingly, the numbers of foreign instructors are proportionally
higher in those departments than in most of the humanities, where
research does not receive so great an emphasis.

A foreign scholar’s ability to do research usually is not impaired
by a limited command of English. But his or her ability to teach is
definitely weakened. The University’s consistent refusal to in-
stitute a language competency requirement is an indication of

priorities.

And it is an indication of priorities that are not in the best in-
terests of students here. The teaching side of the University may
not be the most profitable side, but it is the most important. It is,
after all, supposed to be Pitt’s raison d’etre.

We have no reason to doubt the technical or professional
qualifications of any professor whose command of English is less
than what might be desired. However, the brilliance of an instruc-

’ tor is of no value to students if they cannot even understand what

he or she is saying.

Some sort of minimum language competency standard is badly
needed. Perhaps the various departments could screen instructors
for speaking ability before assigning classes. Perhaps a language
‘training program could be instituted, on a mandatory basis, for
those professors who need it. In any event, we’re glad to see the

Student Government Board involving itself in what is becoming a _

more and more pervasive problem.

Hassled in the Student Union

[walked into the Student Union
the other day and saw several
“gentle people” passing out ﬂiers,
and entering into (or pushing their
way into) discussions with people to
whom they had handed the ﬂiers. I
sat down, ﬁguring it to be the usual
hype, and hoping they wouldn’t
bother me, began reading The
Pittsburgh Sun. It turned out I
wasn't so lucky. ‘One guy
approached me and quietly and
sincerely said, “Have you heard
about the 10 Zimbabwe students at
CMU? Did you know that they were
brought here by the government,
,and....” (Unbeknownst to him, I
had looked over his flier the day
before. I decided to make the best
of the situation.) “I’m sorry,” I
said. ‘‘I’m not really interested.” I
turned away and looked back into
my paper, hoping he'd go away. He
did, ﬁnally. only to turn on some
other poor student who soon began
almost to squirm, being made to
feel immoral for wanting to be
selﬁsh enough to take a few minutes
rest from life’s burdens.

What's the story with these
hyper-moralistic innocents, whose
gentle mannerisms and softness of
speech seems inversely proportion-
al to their moral outrage at the
“system?” Their real arrogance is
appalling! First, through personal
searching, they have discovered a

movement with which they would
like to identify. Well and ﬁne. We
are all looking ‘for something to
belong to, to believe in—something
to which we can devote ourselves.
This truth may be a type of religion,
like Christianity, or an economic
A system, like capitalism or socialism,
or a physical unifying concept like
evolution, or a mind-body integra-
tion system like yoga, or a
self-analytical, mystical system,

' like Zen Buddhism. -

Fortunately, most of us, upo
reaching this point, have the
courtesy (or is it maturity?) not to
foist our truths on other people.
This is something that these
neo-ﬂower children have not yet
learned. They have everything
their way. In their ideological-
moralistic mugging, they delineate
the issue, and before you can blink
your eyes or take a sip of Pepsi, they
force you, predicated on their own
simplistic propositions, and by
means of some verbal harrangue,
into agreeing (or rather acquies-
cing) to what is apparently the only

mo choice available.
my exasperation, I must

retaliate, and I confess I must adopt
some of their own tactics and force
upon them a choice—knock it off or
get lost!

Rhodesian Students at C-MU

W «a v.~.a.~-m .« “y\M._t'..'»q'.- v.. .. v. ..-.~;l-4.

 

There are 19 black students from
Rhodesia studying at Carnegie-
Mel1on’s School of Urban and
Public Affairs. They came.because
it was a chance to get an education
in management skills; Rhodesian
blacks ,do not come by such a
chance often. They were told the
program was non-political, and that
they could use their skills as they
pleased upon completion of the
program. Sounds fine; the headline
of this article could read “Liberal
U.S. University Offers Scholarships
to Oppressed Blacks in Apartheid
Rhodesia.” However, things don’t
always turn out how they appear to
be at ﬁrst, especially when they
look too good to be true. Upon the
arrival of the students, the backers
of the program boasted to the
media and potential investors that
they were training the future
leaders of Rhodesia. Allegheny
Ludlum and other U.S. corpora-
tions with interests in Rhodesia’s
vast chrome resources found it
necessary to protect their interests

by trying to train leaders/puppets
in Ian Smith’s last-hope plan for
majority rule.

Back home in Zimbabwe (the
African name for Rhodesia) there is
a war going on. The Zimbabweans
are fighting ﬁercely for their
independence from the racist
government of Smith, which is
propped up by the U.S. and
Britain, and they are winning.
More than two-thirds of the
countryside has been liberated,
and it’s a little late for some
appeasement plan of Smith’s to put
a few blacks in the government.
Besides which, ‘any self- and
country-respecting black Zimbab-
wean would not be caught dead in
such a traitorous plot.

So when 19 unsuspecting stu-
dents ﬁnd themselves at C-MU,
enrolled in a course of study that
would lead them to betray their
people, what do they do? Their
collective decision was to “de-

Women's Action:

By SUSAN BECK

NOW is a national organization
for women. In fact, with a
membership greater than 50,000, it
is the largest women’s organization
in the U.S. today. It is a vital and
growing organization that is
ﬁghting for equality for women.
The recent attacks on women’s
rights make this ﬁght all the more
critical. ,

The National Organization for
Women has been ﬁghting against
sex discrimination for over a
decade. Formed in 1966 out of the
fury and frustration of 28 women
attending the Third National
Conference of Commissions on the
Status of Women, NOW resolved
“to take action to bring women into
full participation in the mainstream
of American society, assuming all
the privileges and responsibilities
thereof in fully equal partnership
with men.”

The watchword was “action,” as
NOW waged war on all aspects of
sex discrimination. The NOW Bill
of Rights for women includes
demands for the ratiﬁcation of the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA),
the right of women to control their

.9Wn re1>r°£h=ctiv<=|ives- equality in
P employment, adequate childfcare

and an end to discrimination in
education.

The struggle for equality and for
basic rights for women assumes
greater importance in 1977. The
past year has been a period of
setbacks in the struggle for equality
of the sexes.

With a closely approaching
deadline of March 1979, the ERA is
in a virtual stalemate; three more
states are needed for ratiﬁcation.

Phyllis Schaﬂy and the right wing in
this country are conducting a
well-ﬁnanced campaign to “STOP
ERA” and to restrict women’s right
to choose in the matter of abortion.

These opponents of women are
trying to convene a constitutional
convention that would grant rights
to fetuses. In the meantime, our
majority white male Congress is
trying to decide how to most
effectively restrict the rights of poor
and minority women to control their
own reproductive lives. The
proposed Hyde Amendment would
deny funding for abortions to nearly
300,000 women, condemning them
to back alley abortions and possibly
to death. Child care has been
slashed nationwide, along with

_ otter s°s=ia1.sr=!vI¢e$—. .':Ihs.¢a§e 9f.
Alan tﬁalrke 1 and. his charge. ‘of ~

 

nounce the program publicly.”
This decision is causing the
program’s deans, Marion Oliver,
Otto Davies and Norman Johnson,
along with their collaborators
across the ocean, many a restless
night. Their beautiful plan has
been ruined. ,

The repercussions for the stu-
dents, as they arewell aware, could
be severe. Already, they have been
threatened with deportation, which
will undoubtedly mean imprison-
ment. Imprisonment of blacks on

‘political charges in an ‘apartheid

country often means torture and
death, as demonstrated by South
Africa in the case of Steven Bike.

The students deserve the non-
political education contracted to
them by C-MU. They will get only
it if this issue is taken up across the
country by people who insist the
US. not deport them to a fascist
country the U.S. government does
not even recognize.

“reverse discrimination” chal-
lenges the gains women and
minorities have made through
afﬁrmative action in education and
employment.

Women must ﬁght back. As the
largest and most effective organ-
ization for women, NOW can be the
leader in this battle.

National Organization for Women.

Believe it or' not, pizza is actually
more of an American dish than
Italian. True, it was eaten in Sicily
for years before G.l.’s brought a
craving for it home with them from
World War 11. But the gloppy
extravaganzas weighted down with
half a dozen condiments and
leaking grease spots through a
cardboard carton is a far cry from
the original concoction of thick
bread dough with a thin coating of
tomato sauce or sliced tomatoes
and a liberal dose of_ garlic and
oregano.

In short, it has been elaborated
upon considerably since the recipe

. left Palermo. No peasant in the old

country would have dreamed of
wasting a stick of pepperoni by
slicing it up over the pizza.

Times have changed and so has
pizza. Pizza joints rival hamburger
chains for their inﬁltration on
communities, but except for Pizza
Hut, there is no syndicated pizza
franchise to rival McDonald’s, and
thus pizza can keep it’s individual-
ity across the country or even
across the neighborhood.

In Oakland, there are about a
dozen places where you can get
pizza and it’s all different. So, here
is a capsule description of five
pizzerias in Oakland—Antonino’s,
The Original, Gino and Pete’s,
Towers Cafeteria and Uncle Char-
1ie’s.

Uncle CharIie’s

Size: One 12-inch pie, can be
bought by the half or fourth.

Price: $2.40 for whole plain
pizza, $1.20 for a half pie and a
single slice sells for 40 cents.
Deluxe (with everything) runs
about $6.

Extras: Green pepper, hot

pepper, onion, olives, tomato (55

cents extra). Pepperoni and meat-
balls are 60 cents extra. Mush-
rooms, sausage, bacon, and ancho-
vies cost an additional 85 cents.

Comments: Fridays, there’s a
special and you can get a whole
pizza for $1.50 and half for 75
cents. If you buy a whole pie you
can get an Uncle Charlie’s T-shirt
for 50 cents (otherwise, it’s $2).
Pizza bagels are 35 cents.

Atmosphere: A sort of

combination of tiffany lights and
carnival effects. Dim lighting and
blaring juke box make studying or
conversation nearly _ impossible,
but, on the plus side, the help is
great, the food is hot and while

TO PROTECT
THE UNBORN
AND THE NEWBORN

taking a number to get your order
keeps you a bit strained as you try
to listen over the decibel level, it
alleviates alot of confusion:
Quality: Okay. Uncle Charlie's is
sort of bland on the sauce, but they

do load it on with lots of
condiments.
Gino and Pete’s
Size: 18 inches, 16 inches, 14

inches and 12 inches in diameter.

Price: Extra large plain is $3.75,
large is $3.50, medium is $3.25 and
small is $2.25. Large deluxe (with 8
toppings runs for $8.50, the most
expensive combination of all the
pizzerias surveyed here).

Extras: Pepperoni, mushrooms
and sausage are $1.50 extra;
anchovies, olives and green pepper
jack the price up 75 cents more and
onions are 50 cents extra.

Atmosphere: A lot like any small
diner you’ll find in any small town.
Bright lighting, counters and stools
for seating. Pleasant.

Quality: Very good. Probably
the only setback is that they're
made on pre-baked shells that can
be a bit bland. But Gino and Pete’s
probably displays the most consis-
tent quality around. The sauce is
well-blended, the cheese doesn’t
glob together like something from a
science fiction horror ﬂick, and it’s
never over-cooked.

&
Towers Cafeteria

Price: free with your meal ticket,

or $2.

Extras: Depends on the
menu——it could be mushrooms,
sausage or pepperoni.

Comments: You can get as much
as you can eat. Condiments are
used ‘sparsely.

Atmosphere: Multicoloredlights

that make you think someone in the
housing ofﬁce is nostalgic for the
60’s to return.

Quality: Fair. Fair because it is
institutional food and there are
people who like the blandness of
institutional food. The crust is thick
but since quality varies, sometimes
it may be done to perfection, other
‘times it’s doughy and mostly it’s
burnt. Too often it’s served cold.

Antonino’s

Size: Large (18 and a half
inches), medium (16 and a half),
small (14 and a half), piccolo (12
and axhalf) and piccolino (8 inches).

Price: Large is $3.50, medium is
$3.25, small is $3.00, piccolo is

$2.50 and piccolino is $2. All A

toppings cost 75 cents extra.

Extras: Mushrooms, green
pepper, sausage, anchovies, zuc-
chini, black olives, eggplant and
pepperoni.

Comments: One of the few
places where they not only make
their own crusts, but you can
actually watch them ﬂip them.
Connects into a small club where
you can catch a rock band on
weekends. Pizza bread is special at
$1.60 and 80 cents.

.Atmosphere: A well-lit front
room with tables for four plus the
dark club where you can sit if there
isn’t a concert going on.

Quality: Excellent. This is
probably the best pizza in Oakland.
The fresh crust is neither too thick
nor too thin, and it’s done to perfec-
tion. The sauce is excellent, and
there's extra spices you can sprinkle
on. The cheese is well distribu-
ted, and just the right amount is
used.

The Original

Size: Large (16 pieces) and small
(8 pieces).

Price: $2.40 for large and small
sells for $1.90.

Extras: Sausage, pepperoni and

95 cents more on a large pizza).
Onion and extra cheese is 50 cents
extra on either size.

Atmosphere: The Original is
probably one of the dirtiest places
on earth (on the customers’ side of

people who trek through the joint
daily. It is not an appetizing placeto
eat. However, it does have that

variety and exploration because it
has little focus, coherence, or
articulation,” the report said.

One purpose of the review of
distribution of studies courses,
according to Marshall, is to initiate
departmental discussion of 1 the
issues involved in the distribution
of studies question.

These issues, according to the ad
hoc committee, include deﬁning
the type of courses that best suit
the purposes of non-majors, and
give non-majors a sense of the
interrelatedness of the ﬁelds of
inquiry deﬁned by each discipline.

“We have to make it (DOS
requirements) an issue that’s up
front in the departments, and
create a higher consciousness
about DOS that may cause courses
to get better,” Marshall said.

The council already has consid-
ered and voted against ad hoc
committee recommendations on
DOS requirements other than
establishment of a review commit-
tee. The most notable was the
institution of a two-stage DOS
requirement which would have

’ Geils Brings P

ByM. PATRICK MONAHAIW
gm News Sun wnm

“Hopefully, nobody out there
has to work or go to school
tomorrow, and if you have any
plans for later this evening, you

better cancel them because we’re
the Geils band and we’re gonna
play all night long!” '
Last Wednesday, Boston rockers
Geils nearly made good on lead
vocalist Peter Wolf’ s promise.

Geils, formerly the J. Geils Band, was in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving, and put
everyone in a partying mood with its inimitable sound.

Headlining a ﬁne three-act bill
that included Edgar Winter’s
White Trash and Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers, Geils was the last
band of the night and played for
three hours(an hour and a half past
the Civic Arena curfew) before a
large and enthusiastic crowd that
was totallydznmersed in Thanksgiv-
ing spirit and ready to party.

This is the third time in the last
four years Geils has been in
Pittsburgh around turkey time,
and, as usual, it won over the
crowd with its excellent and
infectious blend of danceable hard
rock, funk and move and rhythym
’n’ blues.

Last Wednesday’s special con-
cert celebrated National Record
Mart’s 40th anniversary and
coincided with Geils’ 10th anni-
versary, nine as the J. Geils Band,
and one with the new name but
with the same six-man lineup,
unchanged since the group’s
inception in 1967.

The name change was because
the band felt they were known
primarily as “Geils,” instead of the
J. Geils Band.

What is so impressive about
Geils is its ability to convey this
frolicking party feeling while
delivering some of the tastiest
music you’re likely to encounter
from any band live.

 

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pin New Slall‘\\'riicr

“Neither rain, sleet nor gloom of
night can keep this carrier from his
appointed rounds.”

This popular saying was created
with mailmen in mind, but Sunday
evening, it could have applied to
something else——the Gino Vannelli
concert.

Despite an unexpected blizzard,
loyal Vannelli fans turned out to
hear their favorite recording artist.
The Civic Arena was .not filled to
capacity; many ticket holders did
mot show up to hear the innovative
composer and performer because of
the inclement weather. But nothing
could have stopped the fans who did
come—they love Vannelli that
much.

Hoards of adoring girls flocked to
the raised stage when Vannelli
bounded out, clad in a quiana shirt
that was unbuttoned to the navel,
black velvet pants and fringed beige
boots.

He stomped, swerved, and shook
his long frizzy hair. The girls
swooned.

With outstretched arms, they
yelled, “Gino-Ginoll” One girl
repeatedly tried to climb onto the
stage to give Vannelli a teddy
bear—-perhaps a cherished child-
hood keepsake.

Vannelli knew how to handle the
worshippers. Periodically, he bent
over and touched some hands.

Musically, he touched some
hearts.
Vannelli’ s experimental elec-

tronic compositions enchanted the
audience. After performing three
songs: “Love of My Life,” “Storm
at Sunup” and “People Gotta

M0“?-2” be. thanked the crowd for .

showing up in the bad weather.

The acoustics were poor, and
most of his romantic lyrics couldn't
be understood. The special effects.
particularly the lighting. compen-
sated for this.

On certain chords, the lighting
engulfed Vannelli in an aura of
color. At one point, smoke ﬁltered
on stage, enhancing the dreamlike
quality of the music.

On one song, a white baby grand
piano was wheeled to the stage, and
Vannelli played chords while
improvising vocally.

Throughout the concert, Vannelli
had a good rapport with the

audience. He thanked a secret
admirer who sent him an “esoteric
gift-—underwear,” before the con-
cert, and explained he received it
because in a recent concert, he
unknowingly performed the open-
ing number with his zipper down.

Vannelli than introduced his
brother Joe, who specializes in
keyboards, and produces the
group’s recordings.

Vannelli then sang “A Pauper in
Paradise,” the title tune from his
latest A&M release. This song gave
the rest of the seven-member group
a chance to show off their individual
talents.

Vannelli ﬁnishedthe concert with
“Where Am I Going,” and ran off

' the stage.

But the audience knew he’d be
back for a ﬁnale. Vannelli sang
rousing encores of “People Gotta
Move” and “One Nlghi With You.”

The crowd left the Arena glad
they braved the blizzard to come to
the concert. ’

artyi 'ng Spirit To Pittsburgh

At the core of Geils’ zaniness is
front man and vocalist Peter Wolf,
who is also married to ﬁlm actress
Faye Dunaway.

Wolf is absolutely dynamic
onstage, a seasoned pro who knows
how to relate to an audience with
slick stage rapport and gravily, yet
effective vocals and looney stage
antics. '

Along with the palm slapping,
jiving and dancing Wolf, Geils
consists of J. Geils on lead guitar,
Seth Justman on keyboards,
Stephen Jo Bladd on drums, Magic
Dick on harmonica and Daniel
Klein on bass.

The group has been together for
10 years and it shows. It is tight
musically, but as loose as the Marx
brothers onstage—jumping around
like frogs in synch to the music,
wearing hats from the audience
and generally weaving hilarious
rock ’n’ roll madness.

Couple this behavior with a
crowd lifted with holiday spirit,
anxiously awaiting turkey day and
fun with friends and relatives, and
what you had was one crazy and
happy bunch of people.

Make no mistake about it. One
definitely feels uplifted from
watching and listening to Geils.
They may be big rock ’n’ roll stars
with large, fast cars and other
much-publicized high roller antics,
but with Geils, if these guys
weren’t in the band, they'd be back
home on some street corner in
Boston talking trash and sipping
wine from a bottle. In that respect,
it's very easy for an audience to
relate to them. They're just a
bunch of guys who took their shot
and made it.

Musically, Geils has improved
over the years. The members of the
band have become excellent
musicians, and the sound quality,
coupled with the superb yellow and

red lighting effects, was a basic but
appropriate highlight for the
music.

The band opened with a hard
rock tune, “Somebody,” taken
from its new album, “Monkey
Island,’ then shifted into a more
funky and soulful vein..

“Detroit Breakdown,” “Baby
Don’t Leave Me,” “Love-itis” and
“Give it to Me” were the best of
the tunes, and laid credence to the
claim that Geils are the Young
Rascals of the 70's.

Geils’s new album has taken the
band into a more serious vein of
composing with the “Some-
body’s,” the soulful “I’m Fallin”’
and the title track to “Monkey
Island.”

In Geils slang, Monkey Island is
the time of day when “afternoon
turns into dusk. and dusk turns into
night, and the next thing you see
and remember is the morning
light.” This isn’t a morbid
denouncement of the partying way
of life, just a pronouncement that
you have to be cool about it, from
six guys who have been living on
Monkey Island for the last 10 years.

To celebrate this, Wolf came to
center stage, baseball hat on his
head and a football letter jacket
given to him by a fan in the ﬁrst
row, and popped open a bottle’ of

anniversary champagne, the cork I

exploding loudly into the mike and
ringing throughout the Arena. he
then sprayed the first six rows with
the bubbly.

With the toasts ﬁnished, Geils
went into the best received and
perhaps its unannounced theme
song, “Must Have Got Lost.” It’s a
funky tune dealing with a man’s
plight (presumably someone in
Geils or any urban street corner
bum) who has something going
with a girl, leaves town for a spell

HARRISBURG
members talked for hours Tuesday
about a proposed tax hike to fund
state-aided universities, but took no
action.

Their inaction leaves Penn State,
the University of Pittsburgh and
Temple University each paying as
much as $6,000 daily in interest on
borrowed money.

After Republican and Democrats
spent 2‘/2 hours condemning each
other for either voting or not voting
for higher taxes, the House
adjourned until 9:30 a.m. today.

‘V There was no indication that a

solution would be found to the tax
puzzle today. The House already
has twice rejected a plan that would

(AP)-House A

raisethepersonalincomctax from2
percent to 2.1 percent and the
cxirporate income tax from 9.5
percent to 11 percent, the second
highest in the nation.

The personal tax hike would cost
the average tax payer between 20
and 40 cents more a week. The
problem is the business tax hike,
which some House members say
will drive industry and jobs from
Pennsylvania.

Republican leader Robert Butera
said that informal polls by
Republicans, who have opposed
higher taxes, show that “People
want a solution to the tax ﬁght, they
want their government to continue
to function properly, and they don’t

,, HouseTakes No Tox,Action

want taxes of any sort."

But Democratic leader James
Manderino countered with a Senate
Republican poll, which Manderino
said “indicated in the Common-
wealth think taxes are needed, and
42 ‘percent thing there isn’t a need
to increase taxes.”

All along Republicans have said
they have not voted for higher
spending this year, and therefore
they are not obligated to vote for
higher taxes.

In an attempt to rebut that,
Manderino spent over an hour
detailing all the programs that
Republicans have voted for in the
past and that now are costing
millions of dollars more to run.

ARNOLD:

The Education of a Body Builder
in the Fine Arts Room of the Book Center

MONDAY, DEC. 5th. 1:00-2:00

Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder
by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Douglas Kent Hall

The superstar of the ’70s (Pumping Iron), who redeemed the
sport of bodybuilding from its tacky, comic—book image and
has made it an enthusiasm shared by millions, traces the high
points of his astonishing career (he earned the title of Mr.
_ Universe when he was only twenty years old). Reading mus-
cle magazines as a young boy in Austria, a country where
bodybuilding was the least admired sport, Amold~Schwar—
zenegger began his training, set his goals, and ultimately won
the crown prize of bodybuilding—the Mr. Olympia title—in

1972.

Here also is Arnold’s complete, step—by—step bodybuilding
program for beginners and experts exercising at a gym or at '
home——from what to eat to what is the best time to exercise
and what types of exercises are best for specific muscle
groups. Each exercise is illustrated with easy—to-follow photo-
graphs of Arnold in action. The result is a book that is not only
fun and fascinating to read, but one that opens up a whole
new world of physical fitness to anyone interested in building
body potential, stamina and health. Illustrated with black-

and—white photographs.

“Racism is alive and well in 1001 Cathedral of Learning” — a Pitt student

The Crisis in
Black Studies

It took demonstrations and sit-ins by hundreds of Black students at Pitt to get the administration to

1  a form a Black Studies department in 1969; but ever since, the Posvar administration has been trying to

dismantle it.

The department is faced with losing its autonomy within the university. The administration ap-
propriates to Black Studies the smallest budget of any department in the University. The ad-
ministration has consistently overruled departmental recommendations to rehire faculty members.
Last year, FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg overturned a unanimous departmental decision to renew Prof.
Yusef AIi’s contract. This fall, the Dean rejected department chairman Curtiss Porter’s recommen-
dation to award tenure to Prof. Patrick Ntukogu.

Students have no voice in the future of the department. At one time, the Black Action Society was
consulted on the hiring and promotion of faculty members; now the administration has excluded
students from this process. While the official title. of the department is “The Department of Black
Community Education Research and Development”, it is not being allowed to serve the community.
We think it’s time to put pressure on the administration to allow the department to function properly.

N A sellout crowd of56,S00 remained until the bitter cold end
Saturday as the Pitt football team ended its re ar season
with a ﬂurry, only to fall a yard short of tying archrival Penn
State at Pitt Stadium. Final score: 15-13. -

With the Lions leading, 15-7, the Panthers mounted two
scoring drives within the ﬁnal three and a half minutes,
ﬁnally scorinfon the second one with only 12 seconds
remaining on the clock.

Quarterback Matt Cavanaugh, who had his troII&with
Penn State's defensive line (ﬁve sacks) all day, hit Gordon
Jones cutting over the middle for a 17-yard score and the
Panthers had one more chance to tie the game with a
two-point play.

Lion lineman Matt Millen thwarted all hopes of a Panther
comeback, though, by stopping Elliott Walker on the one as
he slanted off left guard.

“I guess we kept everybody in their seats,” Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill said after the heartbreaker. “I thought we
made a good call on the two-point conversion. We called an
option and Matt saw the linebackers playing soft so he gave it

off inside. it was close, but the oﬁcial said we didn’t make
it—so we didn’t make it.”

As a result, Penn State made it 10 out of the last 11 over the
Panthers and regained the Lambert Trophy, symbolic of
Eastern football supremacy, after Pitt owned it for a year.
The Nittany Lions, by virtue of their 10-1 record, were the
unanimous victors in the seven-man balloting.

Pitt ended its season at 8-2-1 and ﬁnished second in the
Lambert race.

‘ ‘I've been coming to Pitt Stadium for 28 years and this win

_could be the sweetest win for me here,” said Lion coach Joe

Paterno after the game. “I don’t think there's a rivalry in the
country any more intense than this one.”

Pitt had a chance to pull away from its rival late in the ﬁrst
quarter, but leading, 7-3, and on the Lion one-yard line, the
Panthers were called for illegal motion and Cavanaugh later
threw an interception in the end zone to stop the scoring
threat.

“That was the turning point right there,” Sherrill noted.
“if we score, we're ahead, 14-3. We have to score on that
situation.”

The Lions took the lead late in the second quarter when Jim
Cefalo and Mike Guman teamed up for a 52-yard punt return

and the Pitt offense couldn’t crank things up until the near
heroics at the end of the game. 7
Though snow and cold became a factor in the second half,
Sherrill didn’t blame the elements for his team’s inability to
score points. I ‘
“I would have much preferred playing them on a very dry

ﬁeld, but that’s no excuse,” he said. “The turf wasn’t that I

slippery, and I don’t think the snow was factor in the outcome
of the game.” . i _

Despite the loss, Sherrill praised his defensive unit, which
only permitted three ﬁeld goals by Matt Bahr.

‘ ‘I thought we played very well defensively, ’ ’ Sherrill Said.
“We had a couple of breakdowns, but we kept them out of the
endzone so you have to be pleased.” \

PANTHER NOTES: Saturday’s was the Lion's first

appearance in Pitt Stadium since 1971 and was the last until‘ .

1981-the next three games are slated to take place in State
College. . .Neither team had played in its home stadium since
the Panther’s 1973 Beaver Stadium loss. The three games
since have been featured at neutral Three Rivers Stadium,
including last year's 24-7 triumph for Pitt. . .Pitt hasn’t beaten
Penn state twice in a row since back-to-back wins in 1948 and

1949.

Snow covered the sidelines.

“What are they doing offensive-
ly?” Penn State head coach Joe
Patemo yelled into the phone.
Silence. “I’ have no idea,”
defensive coordinator Joe Sandus-
ky answered from the press box
above.

Patemo shivered. It had been a
pressure day—the explosive Pitt
offense, the frigid weather, the
threats against Lion Quarterback
Chuck Fusina’s mother’s life, the
bowl bid controversy reporters
always seemed to harp on, the
season record—-all ‘had been
sufﬁcient reasons to worry about
the outcome of that Saturday
afternoon. But that’s what’s great
about football—you have to beat
the other guy, the weather—and
yourself.

It was a great day for the Penn
State Nittany Lions. They, a young
team often criticized as being too
slow, too defensive-minded, too
inexperienced, too everything, had
beaten slightly-favored Pitt by a
15-13 score, had deﬁed the wintry
coldness with a passing attack that
garnered 146 yards in 13 receptions
and had overcome all criticisms
concerning an inexperienced sec-
ondary by intercepting two Matt
Cavanaugh passes in the end zone.

Once Paterno arrived in the

— crowded locker room, warmed by"

the heat of glaring television lights

_and newsmen sticking microphones

into his face, hitting him with
pertinent questions about the
passing game, the running game",
the defense, the cold, Fusina’s
throwing ability, the Fiesta Bowl
bid, the greatness of the victory, he
smiled with relief. The pressure
was gone; his team had defeated all
the elements and thus was the
victor——and he was glad, over-
joyed, to explain it to them.

“Fusina played a great football
game,” he said into one micro-
phone. “He had to come into
Pittsburgh and play a pressure
game and win it. He showed he
could throw the football with
anyone in the country._I admire him
for being able to play the game he
did under the pressure he was
under.

“And our secondary,” he looked
into the camera. “We have young
people in our secondary, but they
played very well.”

They had beaten themselves...

“The weather was a factor,” he
told one reporter. “But we just felt
we were taking over the game
physically. ’ ’

...the weather...

turned to another reporter. “We’re
developing a football team now that
has a good future ahead of it. This
team that won today is very
young—I don’t think people realize
that.”

pressure was over.

Cagers Lack Intensity

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers discovered it
takes more than talent to win a
basketball game, as Morris Harvey
shocked the Panthers, 76-72, in the
season opener at Fitzgerald Field
House.

It was obvious Pitt had enough
talent to blow the Golden E-agles
out of the city, but the Panthers
played inconsistently throughout
the game at both ends of the court.

“The key factor in our victory
was intensity,” explained Morris
Harvey assistant coach Glen
Koroboy. “We had some ﬁlms of

Pitt and we saw them play last"

week, and we knew we could beat
them because they don’t play as
hard as we do.”. A

Larouche Dealt to Canadiens

MONTREAL (AP)—Pierre La-
rouche, unhappy with his lot in
Pittsburgh, was traded yesterday
by the Penguins to the Montreal
Canadiens, in a National Hockey
League deal, for veteran center

Peter Mahovlich and minor league V

right winger Peter Lee.

“I was shocked when I heard the
news,” said the baby-faced La-
rouche, after‘ the Canadiens held a
brief morning skate in preparation

.for the Penguins-Canadiens game
last night.

“‘When I left Quebec for

Pittsburgh, Iwas 18 years old, and
the ﬁrst two years were good, ” said
Larouche, Pittsburgh's ﬁrst choice
in the 1974 amateur draft. “Last
year, I was not scoring and they
started using me as an excuse for
losing.” .

Larouche, a center. had 31 goals
and 37 assists in his rookie year, and
followed that with 53 goals and 58
assists in his sophomore campaign.

But last season his goal
production dropped .0 29, and he
often expressed his unhappiness in
the Pittsburgh organization. He
received a two-game suspension

because of his attitude, and the
reports from Pittsburgh were that
Larouche was hard to handle.

Whether Montreal’s coach,
Scotty Bowman, will have more
success with him remains to be
seen. But unlike Pittsburgh,
Larouche will not be the No. 1 star
on the Canadiens, who have people
like Guy Laﬂeur, Serge Savard and
Larry Robinson around.

“It’s going to be fun to be in
Montreal,” said Larouche. “But I
am leaving a _lot of good friends
behind in Pittsburgh.

Pitt opened the game in a
man-to-man defense, but the
red-hot shooting of Emil Boat-
wright and Dennis Harris staked
Morris Harvey to a 9-2 lead, forcing
the Panthers into a zone. At that
point, Terry Knight and Wayne
Williams replaced Scheuermann
and Nedrow.

The zone was effective in

keeping the Golden Eagles from.

Panthers closed the gap to .13-9.
Behind the offensive punch pro-
vided by Harris, Pitt forged to a
20-19 lead with 8:01 left in the ﬁrst
half. It was to be the Panthers’ only
lead of the night.

Defensive lapses and cold
shooting plagued the Panthers, as
Morris Harvey outscored Pitt, 20-9,
in the ﬁnal eight minutes to take a
39-29 lead at the half. The
defensive lapses were allowing
people to drive the baseline, and
the Panthers also were guilty of
leaving their feet on defense,
allowing the Golden Eagles to fake
them out of position for the jumper
or to draw the foul with the Pitt
player helpless in the air.

The Panthers opened the second
half with a quicker lineup, and
began to cut away at the 10-point
lead. Clancy threw his weight
around under the boards, Pete
Strickland ran the offense and
Harris didn’t miss as Pitt pulled to
within two points, 45-43, with 16:20
remaining.

Eleven seconds later, Knight
picked up his fourth foul, and
things rapidly began to deteriorate.
Morris Harvey regained control of

the backboards, getting enough
offensive rebounds to score while
limiting Pitt to one shot, and the
Panthers were down by eight,
51-43.

Pitt’s chances for a victory
excited with Harris when he fouled
out with 4:02 remaining and the
Panthers down by 68-64. Morris
Harvey hung on by sinking eight
consecutive free throws, and P’
had lost its ﬁrst opener in thwg
years.

“Give them all the credit,” a
dejected Grgurich said. “We were
really outplayed. When pre-season
ended, I felt our inside game would
be one of our strong points, but you
wouldn’t know it by this game.”

As evidence of this, Scheuer-
mann and Gary Smith, who were to
be the two main men in the pivot,
could muster only one ﬁeld goal
against a team whose tallest player
was 6-6.

“The way we rebounded \ -

another example of us wanting it .2

more than the talent God gave us
allowed,” Koroboy added. “It was
a big game for us, and we went out
on the court and took it away from

“We thought we were an
aggressive team,” Grgurich said.
“We thought we had improved our
rebounding, too. We’re going to
have to re-evaluate ourselves and
work hard to return to the level of
play that we know we are capable.”

A A Game for the Fans

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
The importance of the game was
such that not even the wrath of
Mother Nature could cool the

enthusiasm of the 56,500 who.

braved the elements Saturday at
Pitt Stadium.

There was hardly a thought
given to forfeiting a ticket for the
warm friendly conﬁnes of a living
room seat, as the student section
was overﬂowing well before the
scheduled kickoff time of 12:50
p.m.
The heated debates over who
slipped the knife into whose back
during the bowl scramble” and
“who was going to repay whom
during the game” were put on ice
(like everything else) before kickoff
as the fans directed their attentions
to more pertinent questions: How
to keep the feet warm? How to
successfully sneak a pint of liquid
insulation past the “eagle eye” at
Gate 6? Will the Golden Girls
disappoint 56,500 and keep their
capes on, and if they don’t, how to
get close enough to see whether the
cold would give them rosy cheeks?

The confidence in the Pitt
student section was unbridled,
many fans likening the Penn State
chore to catching lightening in a
jar.

“Beating Notre Dame gives you
a great feeling,” proclaimed a 1977
Pitt alumnus, “but running over
Penn State last year made me feel
twice as good. Ilove to see old Joe
(Paterno) take it on the chin. Just
the thought of it helps me sleep at
night. I plan on pleasant dreams
tonight.”

Two sideline analysts had the

(I

non-alcoholic insulation disguised
as hot chocolate.

“Pitt will pass Penn State silly,
take an early lead and then pick off
a couple of Fusina’s passes,” said
the one wearing the button that
phonetically spelled out area
sentiment toward the Lions.

“No way,” countered his com-
panion. “Fusina will pick Pitt apart
because his offensive line will give
him all day to throw. Pitt will be
lucky »to score twice.” As if to
emphasize the point, he ﬂipped his
lapel to show a button that proved
people from Penn State believe the
Cathedral of Learning would make

APANTHER ROOTER

 

an excellent ﬁre hydrant for State

, College dogs.

All the bantering was replaced
by a wait-and-see attitude, as the
fans settled into their seats
anticipating the game that has

~ become one of the most exciting in

the world of college football.
For those who believe in signs

from the Almighty, there were

plenty that, in retrospect, predicted
a rough day for the Panthers.

The sun made an appearance in
the ﬁrst quarter with Pitt leading,
7-3, and marching toward another
score. After the ﬁrst of two passes
Matt Cavanaugh had intercepted in
the end zone, the sun disappeared,
seemingly content to catch the
highlights the next day on the
Jackie Sherrill Show.

The new scoreboard blew a fuse
early in the second quarter, around
the same time Pitt’s offense began
to short circuit.

And during the pre-game intro-
ductions, a rabid Pitt fan, intent on
voicing his displeasure when
Paterno was announced, jumped
up to boo, only to have the bottle of
brandy slip out of its hiding place
and smash at his feet before the
seal had even been broken.

Pitt fans refused to acknowledge,

that the Panthers could lose the
grudge match, even late in the
game when it was clear a tie was
the best Pitt could do.

After Elliott Walker was stopped
short on the conversion attempt,
more than one student stood and
cheered as the dejected Panthers
walked to the locker room.

“I never expected Pitt to be this
good this year, so why shouldn't I
give them a hand,” explained one

The only reason many Pitt fans arepnot penniless
today is that no one else was crazy enough to wager
that Pitt would lose twice Saturday.

Even after Jackie Sherrill’s Panthers had fallen
(slipped?) to various forces of white at‘Pitt Stadium
Saturday afternoon, the Blue and Gold seemed to be
a good bet. The basketball team, despite coming off
a season in which it won exactly half as many games
as the football team, figured to overwhelm Morris
Harvey at the Field House.

Al McGuire, wholast season led Marquette to the
. .AA title and then retired, recently revealed his

 ‘cret to success. “I rank scheduling first,” he said,

placing it above coaching, officiating and material,
“because that includes not just whom you play, but
also when and where you play them. You’re sup-
posed to open,” he concluded, “with East Cup-
cakeﬁ’

Taking that advice, Tim Grgurich must have been
looking forward to Saturday night. He’d sent out to
Charleston, W. Va., for some East Cupcake, and
Morris Harvey seemed to fill the order.’ He decided
to devour them at home, before a decent crowd com-
prised mainly of Pitt students and Morris Harvey

.5.

A A H‘ And he chose Saturday night, which, after the Pitt-

Penn State football game, gave Grgurich a chance to
show a group of still-dejected and -frozen students
football isn’t the only major sport at Pitt.

\

But, after what Morris Harvey (who cares what the
nickname is) did to the Panthers—a four-point loss
to a school like that is little different than a 40-point
loss to a school like that——it seems East Cupcake
wasn’t enough. Accordingto some unhappy fans
(they’d sobered enough by the end of the game to
realize what had happened), a better idea would have
been to bring in East Cupcake High.

‘And that is cruel, ‘especially since Pitt spends a
great deal of money trying to convince everyone it’s a
major school. But how many good things can one

say about a team that loses to Morris Harvey? That
its uniforms were nice?

In fact, the new uniforms were colorful, but the
numbers were hard to read—not that any Pitt players
would have been too anxious to be recognized.

But people are at a loss in this case. Tim Grgurich
is a great guy, one of the few college coaches who

A

 

sees players as more than tonnage and times in the 40
yard dash. He was a scrappy player and brings en-
thusiasm to his job. He occasionally recruits great
players. He works hard. The man even lives clean.
He doesn’t deserve to lose, but he does.

It can’t be talent that causes Pitt to be such a god-
send to schools such as West Virginia Wesleyan,
Youngstown State, Cleveland State and Morris
Harvey. Larry Harris can shoot with anyone, and, if
he feels like it, can control a game. Sonny Lewis does
things with his body and a basketball other players
can only dream about: Sam Clancy, it appears,
could turn out to be better than either of them.

They work hard at practice. They go first class.
They want to win, and have a tough time accepting
those nights when they don’t.

So why do they lose so often that the first-string
cheerleaders don’t show up at the games anymore?

For more than a year, Pitt basketball followers
have muttered that Grgurich is the problem. The
mutters, as of Saturday night, changed to screams.

Grgurich has problems, to be sure, but it is at least
too early-—and probably incorrect—-to say he is the
problem that has small schools begging to take on his
Panthers. Many of his errors stem from the fact he is

   

1

a young coach, but youth is a crime only in the eyes
of George Allen. Others come from the fact he is too‘

nice a guy; he believes he has to make everyone hap- 

l

py, especially his players, so he plays them all.

But Grgurich is changing. He’s growing wiser and‘
a bit less intense in his third season; he was relatively
calm during Saturday night’s game and he sat oc—j
casionally. Several players, including Bob Haygood,
sat during theentire evening.

The results were the same, but Grgurich, instead of j
screaming himself hoarse, sat almost silently, looking
as surprised about what what happening as everyone
else was.

And that could-be as good as the outcome was bad. ‘

Tim Grgurich does almost everything right, but loses.
The things he does incorrectly can be corrected. It
may take a week; it may take a year (it won’t take any
longer, since he’ll probably leave with Larry Harris if

this entire season is a washout). But Tim Grgurich ‘

should be worth the wait—even if West Virginia

season on a last-minute shot by Frank Boyd, is
licking its lips right this minute.

Fanslackclass 1

As bad as Pitt’s showing was Saturday night, the‘

evening’s low was recordedby those Pitt fans who, in
what has become almost a tradition in the student

section, greeted Wayne Talbott with a vigorous‘

round of boos. It may be fun, especially on an
evening that offers little about which to cheer, but it

reminds me a great deal of the mentality that forced‘

Wayne Adams to quit school. Sports is entertain-

ment, though all coaches, most players and many

, fans take it much too seriously. It would be only fit- 

ting if the idiot who has spent two Novembers

threatening Chuck Fusina’s mother lost three months

pay on the game, and slipped on his “Pitt Number
One” button on his way down from the Stadium

Saturday. If seeing Penn State win ruined the guy’s 

week, great.

Green Fulfills

Football

By KAREN KADILAK

To say Pitt defensive end Hugh
Green loves to play football would
be an understatement. Green, who
won the Chevrolet Defensive
Player of the Game award in Penn
State’s 15-13 squeaker over the
Panthers at Pitt Stadium Saturday,
gears his whole life to the game.

“I’ve got it in my mind that I
can’t do anything except play
football,” the easygoing freshman
said.

“It’s a philosophy I have,”
Green continued. “I’m a ﬁrm
believer in the theory we’re put
here for a purpose. My purpose is
to play football. It's not any kind of
religious principle I have, it’s just
the way I feel.”

Green has started to fulﬁll his
purpose. The ﬁrst-year player from
Natchez, Miss., has played excel-
lent football for the Panthers at left
defensive end.

Saturday against the Nittany
Lions, Green had his best game of
the season. On his way to defensive
player of the game honors, the 6-2,
206 lb. Green kept Pitt in the game
until the very end, sacking Penn
State quarterback Chuck Fusina,
and leading the team in tackles.

Green, who also turned in a ﬁne
performance in the Panthers’ sea-
son opener against Notre Dame,
said he thinks he has learned more
since the beginning of the season.

“I’ve learned to beat the block
more, and I’ve also learned to
pursue quicker,” Green said.
“Before, I had the tendency to
wait for the play to come to me
instead of going after the ball-
carrier.”

By the Associated Press

NEW YORK—Quarterback Doug
Williams of Grambling State
University, college football's all-
time leader in passing yardage and
touchdown passes, was named to
The Associated Press all-America
team Tuesday, the ﬁrst player from
a predominantly black school to be
so honored.

Purpose

Green said he hasn’t been
affected by the extra attention he
has received lately.

“It’s an honor to win awards,
Green said in reference to the
defensive player of the game award
he picked up Saturday. “But I
don't think I've changed because of
it. I’ve learned more about the
game, but I haven't changed as a
person, and I don’t think I ever
will.”

9!

Green, who played his ﬁrst game
in the snow Saturday, said the
sub-zero chill factor and swirling
wind didn’t bother him.

“I lived in San Francisco when I
was younger,” Green explained,
“so cold really isn’t new to
me—but the snow was. The game
really wasn’t cold until halftime.
You don’t notice the cold playing
football as much as you do, say,
walking up to the stadium for
practice. You’re more active in a
football game.”

The freshman said he has taken
extra steps to combat the cold when
he isn’t playing football.

“I brought along a lot of winter
coats and things.” Green said. “I
try to stay in as much as I can, too.

Green, who comes from the area
that has produced pro stars Walter
Payton and Robert Brazile, does
not regret his decision to come to
Pitt—cold ' weather or no cold
weather.

“Ball is ball,” Green said. “I’ll
play anywhere. I’ve gotten a lot of
opportunities at Pitt. I’m sure I’ll
get used to the weather here.”

grading by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association from Division
II to the major Division I this season,
Williams completed 160 of 315
passes in the Tigers’ ﬁrst 10 games
for 2,974 yards and 34 touchdowns.

For his career, Williams has
passed for 8,008 yards and 91
touchdowns. As a junior he broke
the Grambling record of 53
touchdown passes set by James
Harris, now with the San Diego
Chargers, and last year he erased
the State of Louisiana single-season
standard held by Terry Bradshaw of
the Pittsburgh Steelers.

  Tankers Make Debut

Against Tough Tar Heels

By ANGELA VAVITHES

The Pitt swim team will begin its
1977-78 season tomorrow night at
7:30 with the toughest meet of the
year. Some people consider the
University of North Carolina to be
the toughest team the Panthers
have faced in 15 years, but, Coach
Bradshaw feels Pitt is capable of an
excellent season.

At a meet held last week at

if}lWest Virginia, Dale Pﬂaumer, a

9

Pitt sophomore, took ﬁrst place in
the 1000 meter freestyle with a
time of 9:44.25. Mickey Termin
took the 200 meter freestyle in
1:46.08, while Dave Civis showed
Pitt can handle the sprints by
taking the 50 and 100 meter
freestyles.

Stuart Swanson, one of seven

high school all-Americans to join ‘

the team, will have his work cut out

for him in the 200 meter
backstroke, as he will be facing an
old rival, Ken Ireland. When
Ireland (who was the nation’s
second ranked high school back-
stroker) and Swanson met last

summer, Ireland held a one-second
advantage over Swanson.

Swanson, recently chosen to
represent the United States in a
meet with East Germany and rated
14th in the world, is certain to
provide the Panthers with talent.

The Tar Heels have the nation’s
top prep school 100 meter
breaststrokerman, Tom Prassas,
and 100 meter flyer, Arnold Perez.
With seven high school all-Ameri-
cans and an array of experienced
swimmers, North Carolina un.
doubtably will offer the Panthers
some of the most exciting races of
the season.

Mahovlich to Pens

(Continued from Page 20)

“There is more pressure playing
here. The fans expect you to win. In
Pittsburgh, if you win two or three
in a row it’s all right.”

Larouche missed most of Pitts-
burgh’s training camp after under-
going surgery in August to repair a
damaged ankle. In 20 games this
year, he had six goals and ﬁve
assists for 11 points.

Mahovlich, who has been a
part-time player at best with the
Canadiens this season, seemed
relieved when he heard the news.

,{~’,_, ‘‘I didn’t know who they were
1 going to trade for, but the fact I was

Km,“

traded is no surprise,” Mahovlich
said. “I think they are getting an
awful talent in Pierre Larouche.
He’s a great hockey player.

“And as far as Pittsburgh is
concerned, they are going to try to
fill two spots with Peter Lee and
myself.

“I have seen Peter Lee play and I
know he is a good hockey player.
Given the opportunity to play, I
know he can help this hockey club.”

In 17 games with the Canadiens,
Mahovlich had three goals and five
assists. One of his goals was a
game-winning effort.

Lee, Montreal’s ﬁrst choice in the

 76 amateur draft and 12th
over-all, has been with Nova Scotia
of the American Hockey League.
He had eight goals and 11 assists in

In Surprising Trade

23 games with the Voyageurs this
season.

The Canadiens also will receive
future considerations from the
Penguins, although these were not
defined.

Pensspanlred, 9-1

MONTREAL (AP)-—-Rejean
Houle scored two goals and Pierre
Larouche, acquired from Pittsburgh
earlier in the day, added three
assists, leading the Montreal
Canadiens past the Penguins 9-1 in
a National Hockey League game
Tuesday night.

Yvon Lambert and Doug Rise-
brough scored 20 seconds apart to
cap a four-goal Montreal burst in
the opening period. Steve Shutt and
Yvan Coumoyer had the other goals
for the Canadiens in the period.

Guy Laﬂeur scored his 19th goal
of the season for Montreal at 2:46 of
the second period and Bob Gainey
made it 6-0, one minute later before
Pittsburgh ﬁnally got its only goal
by Blair Chapman at 19:13.

Houle got both his goals in the
ﬁnal period and Pierre Mondou
capped the scoring for Montreal at
18:10, just 23 seconds after
Houle’s second tally.

Mondou and Coumoyer each had
two assists as Montreal outshot
Pittsburgh 39-29.

Geils Gives It To

Second on the bill to Geils was

ﬁe recently-reformed E-dgar Win-
if  r’s White Trash, a band headed

45$);

Q

Q

by one of the legendary rock ’n’ roll
Winter brothers from Texas.
Winter, the core of the band,

gets help form vocalist Jerry
,LaCroix. They seem intent on
getting back to their basic

blues-rock roots, something Winter
has forgone in his more commercial
outﬁt of recent years, The Edgar
Winter Group.

White Trash’s set was well
received and was masked by
energetic renditions of two songs
from the old days, “Keep Playin’

,. “§-that Rock n’ Roll" and “Turn on
'isJ§Your Lovelight,” along with a crisp

new rocker “Gee, It's Great to Be
Back Together Again.”
The greatest crowd response was

generated with a hot and nasty ’

playing of the million-selling AM
hit, “Frankenstein,” with Winter’s
keyboards and Floyd Radford's
stinging guitar blasting this superb
instrumental into high gear.

Opening the show was an
up-and-coming Southern band
from Florida, Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers. Unlike most of the
bands from the South. Petty and
company sound more English than
their Southern roots would sug-
gest.

Petty is a nasal singer with a
twan like that of a dryer Roger
McGuinn. and on “American Girl"
he sounded very much like the
ex-Byrd leader.

Petty, with his long blond hair. is
a stunning stage ﬁgure, while his
band, althoughbasic, were quite
energetic, particularly on the

Animal’s 6075 hit, “Don’t Bring Me

Down.“-~

Sez here in & #1 that in the upcoming
Superman movie, Lois and Clark “Do It,”
which “you never saw in the comic books.”
\'Vell, maybe you never saw it, but then. who
wants hard-core in a funnybook anyway? I

- refer you to Superman #297, March, 1976.

Page 12, Panel 5. TV screen shows The T0-
night Show. Clark:~“Lois, do you think. . .”
Panel 6. TV screen shows test pattern. Clark:
“You know what time it is—?” Lois: “Don’t
want to know!” Panel 7. TV screen is blank.
Lois: “Clark—where have you been all my
life?” Clark: “Would you believe. . .the office
next door—?” And at the top of page 13, the
caption reads, “And the following morn-
ing. . .” Lois is putting a flower in a vase on
Clark’s desk. Her word balloon reads, “I feel
pretty, I feel lovely. . .” and is surrounded by
musical notes. What happened while you
were turning the page? You tell me. . .

How come VVoOdy Allen and F10 and
Eddie were mentioned in “Here We Go

- Again,” but they weren’t in the picture? And

that didn’t look like Kris Kristofferson at all.

Artistic license, we guess; illustrator Tim Clark

just decided not to use Woody, Flo and Eddie, and

who are we to argue with Art? Or Tim? And it does
look a little like Kris.

Several copies of my school paper were dis-
tributed without Ampersands, and I got one of
them. Without. I’m pissed! I went back to get
another paper, with Ampersand, and they were
all gone. That’s a real gyp.

Star Wars Letters,

I can’t believe it! Really! My roommate
and I watched The Making of Star Wars on TV
and we got into this big argument about
whether C3P0 was a mechanical robot or a
real person; we were ready to write to George
Lucas for an answer, when Ampersand arrived
with that interview. Uncanny. And good! I
loved it, especially since I won the argument.

So that’s C3 P0._]ust human after all, and a

Enough OfStar Wars! Soon you’ll have in-

guns. Can’t you people (and I include all
magazines, not just Ampersand ) think of any-
thing else to write about? Star Wars was a cute
kiddie show that for some reason made a
great deal ofmoney. Let’s leave it at that, and
spare us one more story about George Lucas
in the Tunisian desert and all the problems
he had making millions ofdollars.

How can you expect us to believe that you
know anything about contemporary music,
when you (1) say that Split Enz have split up,
and (2) print a photo of the Rolling Stones
with Mick Taylor?

ARTHUR FEIN

Uh. . .well. . .er. . .you’ve got us on both points.
The Split Enz have just released their second album,
and we got the photo of the Stones from their record
company, which  doesn ’t know the diﬂerence

t r



between Mick Taylor (a bland) and Ron Wood (a
brunette) either. A/Iaybe you should write to them,
too. Fortunately, the person responsible for both er-
rors from our end generally stays away from musical
subjects. Or will. -

Where did those letters in the first issue
come from? Did you make them all up?

EDWARD HENRY
UNIvERs1TY Or ARI7.ONA

Before the first issue was put together, there was
an even ﬂrster issue, which we in the magazine biz
refer to as a “dummy.” It went to potential advertis-
ers and such, to give them an idea what Ampersand
would look like. It had letters, too, which is even
more puzzling.

I can see how Ampersand tries to appeal to
the majority of the college crowd—photo
runs of Stevie Nicks! But there are those out
there who love Lou Reed and Patti Smith,
too. And you shouldn’t ignore groups like the
Sex Pistols or the Ramones either. Not every
student is Greek, or a business major, or a
lawyer’s kid.

Still Kicking

LoNNIE DONEGAN Is COMING BACK. Lonnie
Donegan had a big hit record back when
most ofus were toddlers, called “Rock Island
Line,” a Leadbelly composition about a
train, all done up in the skiffle sound. John
Lennon, George Harrison and Paul
McCartney once played in a skiffle band, the
Quarrymen; Lennon, McCartney and Har-
rison went on to other things, but Donegan
didn’t, not Inuch. Now he’s on the old come-
back trail with Puttin ’ on the Style, a collection
of his old hi_ts, updated. “Ho hum,” you say.
But just look at this list of names assisting
Lon in his endeavor: Elton John, Leo Sayer,
Ringo Starr, Rory Gallagher and Ron Wood.

HAIR, THE BY-NOW-BE-WHISKERED COURI-
erculture musical, will finally be made into a
movie, ten years after its initial hitdom. Not
only a movie, but an expensive movie,
budgeted at $7.25 million at least. It will still
take place in New York in the late 60s, but the
story will be changed a bit. Twyla Tharp,

he‘s been considering this possibility for a

The producers of Rolling Stone: the 10th An-

Lesley Ann \\'arren got too close to an

(rig/2!) ,' Shir/e_'y .'lIarI,az'ne and nlnm’ Ifarzrmﬂ in
Turning Point (lejft/.

 

JULIA, with Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave,
Jason Robards; written by Alvin Sargent, di-
rected by Fred Zinnemann.

“I am old now, but I want to remember what
was once there for me.” Lillian Hellman,
portrayed byJane Fonda, speaks these words
at the beginning ofjulia, an uncompromising
moviesbased on her remembrance ofa child-
hood friend (played by Vanessa Redgrave)
first published in her Pentimento collection.
The film recounts, through the first person
presence of Hellman, the friendship she
shared with the granddaughter of one of
America’s richest families. It also tells us
something about the choice we make as
adults, the nature of heroics and the value of
commitment, political and emotional.

Because the movie is gleaned from
Hellman’s own memory, it ﬂirts with time
and space, resting for only short periods
within the traditional narrative framework.
Yet under Fred Zinnemann’s intelligent,
somewhat detached direction and Alvin Sar-
gent’s terse script, this structure is never in-
coherent, and as the movie progresses, the
fragmentary pieces weld into one.

We see glimpses of Julia and Lillian, from
their magical innocent intimacy as children
to their mature devotion to each other as
adults. Yet as close as the two women are,
their paths diverge. Lillian in New York

“ writes plays with the guidance of her lover,

famed writer Dashiell Hammett, and be-
comes famous with her Children’: Hour suc-
cess. Julia travels to Vienna to study with
Sigmund Freud. She rejects her family’s no-
tion of privilege and becomes a passionate
champion of workers’ rights. She also finds
herself caught in the coming Nazi holocaust.
Despite the narrative strength of julia, the
film’s considerable force truly rests with the
powerful performances of Jane Fonda and
Vanessa Redgrave. Neither has ever been
more stunning. Fonda is remarkable as the

v ‘Q /.

physically awkward Hellman,ia woman
whose beauty comes from her intelligence,
her loyalty and her righteous anger. Fonda,
one ofthis country’s most graceful actresses,
nevertheless manages to transform herself
into a tough—minded, strong-centered
woman — exactly the image Hellman has
always painted of herself. No less out-
standing is Vanessa Redgrave. She is one of
the few actresses able to suggest the Ideal and
the Mythic. She is profoundly moving as the
martyredJulia.

The supporting cast is equally strong:
Jason Robards’ low-keyed, sardonic Ham-
mett; Hal Holbrook’s gloriously decadent
Alan Campbell; Rosemary Harris’ clever
Dorothy Parker; Meryle Streep’s obnoxious
Ann—Marie, and Maximilian Schell’s under-
stated Mr. Johann. Also outstanding in a
brilliant moment is Robert Glover as a
spoiled scion who epitomizes the careless,
idle rich ofthe 30’s.

Lillian Hellman wrotejulia as a tribute to
her dear friend: to remind us all, once again,
what friendship can mean and perhaps as
importantly, to tell us what heroism really is.
Her motives have been well served by this

TUILNING POINT, with Shirley MacLaine,
Anne Bancroft; written by Arthur Laurents,
directed by Herb Ross.

Turning Point, like julia, deals with an
enduring friendship between two women,
but whereasjulia is both modern and time-
less, Turning Point is ﬁrmly rooted in the tradi-
tion of the 1940 melodrama. True, Turning
Point has a contemporary look and it twirls
past sophisticated dialogue with the grace of
a Pavlova, but it’sjust as easy to pictureJoan
Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead
roles as it is to watch Anne Bancroft and Shir-
ley .\IacLaine.

For all its outward trappings ofclass, Turn-

Friends 8c Lovers

mg Point is really a soap opera about two
women; Emma, played by Bancroft, who
stayed with the ballet and became a great
dancer; and Didi, played by MacLaine, who
gave it all up to marry and have children.
After losing touch with each other for nearly
twenty years, they renew their friendship
when Didi’s oldest daughter, Emilia, is ac-
cepted into the ballet company under Em-
ma’s tutelege.

The dance in Turning Point is superb,
thanks to stellar talents like Mikhail
Baryshnikov, who also co-stars in a dramatic
role; Antoinette Silbey; Peter Martins and
others. But for all the beauty ofits dancing,
Turning Point never quite leaps above the
commonplace.

One of its main problems is Laurent’s
script, at best a clever re-working of a very
hackneyed premise; its reliance on the “Con-
frontation Scene” as a dramatic device is
painfully clichéd. However, Turning Point
does have its share of valid moments. Didi
and Emma struggling to overcome the
jealousy inherent in the way each views the

other’s life choice is poignant, and although .

Emilia’s affair with Yuri (Baryshnikov) is
predictable, it does have a genuine tender-
ness to it, and it thankfully eschews the Red
Shoes marriage-or-career ending.

The real dramatic plus to Turning Point is in
its acting. Shirley MacLaine is down-to-
earth and perceptive as Didi and Anne Ban-
croft, with her straight back and fine bones, is
completely believable as a prima ballerina —
no mean trick for a women who has never
danced. Their scenes together have passion
and wit; it’s a pleasure to watch two such
credible actresses. Mikhail Baryshnikov in
his first screen role is charming as
a Russian defector with a slightly pro-
miscuous yen for women, and Leslie Browne,
who stepped into her role when Gelsey Kirk-
land (Baryshnikov’s ABT partner) became
sick, is lovely as the young Emilia.

     
    

Actually, Turning Point isjust good enough
to make you wish it were better and not bad
enough to dismiss entirely. J A

VALENTINO with Rudolf Nureyev, Michelle
Phillips, Leslie Caron. Directed by Ken Rus-
sell.

The pre-release publicity on Valentino.
which marks the acting debut of ballet star
Rudolf Nureyev, would have us believe the
film is the erotic turn—on of the year—an
R-rated film that barely made it. But the film
itselfdoesn’t support the hysteria. For all it’s
excesses, and certainly any Ken Russell
movie is filled with excess, Valentino is an
oddly asexual movie, devoid ofpassion. Since
it deals with the screen’s greatest lover, every
woman’s rape fantasy in the l920’s and a
man whose sexual ambiguity is still a matter
ofdebate, this lack ofintensity is doubly dis-
turbing.

Ken Russell is a director obsessed with
finding the psychological nightmare lurking
behind famous facades. From his early BBC
biographies, right through his screen epics on
Liszt and Mahler, Russell has ignored facts
in favor of his version of The Truth. This is
also certainly the case with Valentino. You’d
be hard pressed to find factual material in the
movie, but somehow that isn’t its basic fault.
After all, if you want facts you can read the
encyclopedia. Movies, particularly Ken
Russell movies, are out for something more
transcendant than tawdry day-to-day
reality. Unfortunately Valentino never reaches
the heavens.

The movie is a flashback, framed with the
funeral parlor where the adagio dancer’s
preened body lies in state. There the women
who most influenced his life come to mourn
and be besieged by the rapacious press. It is
through their eyes that we see glimpses ofthe
Latin lover’s life. Of all the women, two

Cassettes — The
Inside Story

Ah, glamor! Sex has glamor. Electronics has
glamor. Sculpture, fashion, a painting, a
sleek car —- these may have glamor. But an
honest workman, sober, industrious and cov-
ered with the dirt of a day’s work has no
glamor. .

It’s patently unfair, but this lack ofjustice
is universally applicable. Consider the eas-
sette, for example. Nearly everything written
about it is with reference to the magnetic tape
it contains. VVe worry about dynamic range,
we fret about signal-to-noise ratio, we write
reams about optimum recording levels and
we get excited about tape hiss. W'e’ve
watched the progress of cassette tape toward
20 kHz and have been cheered by it.

But cassettes don’t exist by tape alone.

Inside each cassette is a transport, hardly
known to the cassette user. It works, it does a
magniﬁcentjob, it gets abuse, is subjected to
sudden starts and stops, but is taken for
granted.» It has no glamor. There are no

 

seminars on tape mechanisms, only about
tape. The transport and the shell housing it
are hardly known and yet we owe them the
miracle of cassette tape recording.

One of the most remarkable features of the
cassette is that it is compatible. Stop and
think what that means. We have six or more
top quality cassette manufacturers —— Fuji,
Maxell, TKD, BASF, Memorex, Capitol -
and a much larger number of cassette deck
manufacturers. Yet every cassette made
must ﬁt into any model of any cassette deck
made by any manufacturer. The closeness of
tolerance, that of the cassette and the deck
into which it must ﬁt, is remarkably ﬁne.

Start with the tape housing. Those you
have in your home are made of plastic. Alu-
minum can be used but is more expensive
and so you’ll ﬁnd such housings in commer-
cial and industrial applications. The plastic
case comes in two sections which can be
sealed or held together by tiny screws. The

ﬂscrew type lets you get at the innards in case
of tape trouble, an action you may very likely
regret.

Every cassette has a pair of windows, one

*3 on each side, permitting a tantalizing look at

the inside. Their purpose is to let you see how
much tape is on each hub, yet keep you from
the temptation to touch the tape with your
ﬁngers. The window has a pair of small circu-
lat: openings enabling you to reach in and
touch the inner teeth of each hub, letting you
move the tape. On some cassettes there is a
time scale pasted to the tape viewing window
to help you locate a particular section on the
tape.

Inside the cassette are a pair of liners.
These can be made of plastic or paper, can be
specially creased, curved, or may be ﬂat.
Whatever their shape they do two important
jobs. They hold the hubs in position and they
help guide the tape into a smooth, ﬂat wind,
without cusping. A creased liner may be rib-
bed to help it perform. Liner sheets that are
curved, ribbed or creased exert more guiding
pressure than flat sheets. Now this is a nicely,
but an important one, and it is something for
which you pay when you buy a quality cas-
sette.

Sandwiched between the upper and lower
plastic liners are a pair of hubs, correspond-
ing to the reels used in open reel decks._ The
tape ends, the leaders, are held to the hubs by
a plastic pin. Sudden starts and stops at the
beginning or end ofthe tape can sr'fap the pin
out of position and when this h_appens you
can add the cassette to your “mementos of

. the past” ﬁle. Trying to get the pin and tape

leader back into place can be a lovely exercise
in futility.

VVhile the single pin lock seems to work,
some cassettes use a double pin or a double
locking arrangement. Fast forward and fast
reverse can be most damaging at the begin-
ning or end ofthe tape when strain is exerted
directly on the hub lock. After several wraps
oftape around the hub, the strain is taken up
by the tape itself.

The tape must be positioned inside the
cassette housing so it can make intimate con-
tact with the gap in the cassette head. This
means the tape must be positioned so it is at
an absolute 90° angle with its housing. To do
this the cassette is equipped with a pair of
rollers at opposite ends of the cassette hous-
ing. These rollers ride a small pin which acts
like axles.

You might think that a roller is a roller is a
roller and let it go at that. In some cassettes
the roller isn’t equipped with a center pin and
so it doesn’t turn. This causes two problems.
The ﬁrst is there is friction between the guide
and the tape. The other is that the tape deck
can ride up and down, resulting in an uneven
feed to the head in the deck. _

As the cassette tape moves past the head in
the cassette deck it must somehow be made to
have good contact with that head. Ifthere is
the slightest air space between the head and
the tape, the recording level will take quite a
drop. It is also possible to go to the other
extreme and to press the tape so strongly
against the head that head/tape friction is
greatly increased. This results in both head
and tape wear.

Pressure pads are used to hold the tape
against the head and various designs are
used. Basically, a pressure pad is made offelt
or can be a combination of felt and foam. In
some cassettes the felt pressure pad is held in
place by a strip ofspring metal such as beryl-
lium copper. But no matter what method is
used, the objective is to maintain constant
head-to-tape contact.

When you buy a quality cassette, such as
those made by Fuji,,you buy ‘hidden’ quality.
You must rely on the manufacturer for there
is no other way to assess quality at the point
of purchase. There is no such thing as a bar-
gain cassette. There are low-priced cassettes,
but “low price” in the case of cassettes is in
no way synonymous with quality. Using a
low-priced cassette in a top quality tape deck
is like buying a Porsche and then expecting it
to run on the cheapest brand of gasoline
available. —

In neither instance does it make any sense.

November, I 97 7

BY SALLEY RAYL

It was 4:35 a.m. as [fell into bed. It seemed like only
minutes had passed when the phone rang — loud and obnoxi-
ous. I fumbled for the receiver on the nightstand next to the
bed. It was instinct. “Hello,”Igroggled.

“This is room service. Are you ready to order? ” The voice
on the other end inquired. It was a mufﬂed voice and the
accent sounded like a cross between British and Swahili.

“Order what? What time it is? ”I asked.

“Eight o ’clock, ” the voice replied.

“In the morning? ”

“Y es. What would you like for breakfast?”

“I don ’t eat breakfast. Do I have to get up now or some-
thing? Who isthis?” . '

“This is Room Service.’ You must have something to eat.
Now, we have bacon and eggs. . .”

This was getting ridiculous, I thought, and not worth
arguing about. “Okay, okay. I ’ll have coffee, two glasses of
orange juice and an English  ” .

“Fine,” the voice said, seemingly content with the order.
“It ’ll be aboutﬁve minutes.” _

Wonderful, I thought, hanging up the receiver. This
sounds like some kind of -a cheap trick. Five minutes.’ Holy
shit.’ I ﬂew out of bed, into the shower and back out. I was
pulling on my Levi ’s when I heard the knock. More curious
than hungry, I ﬂung open the door. The sight before me was
worth every bit of the insanity—and then same. There he
was—Rick Neilsen—dressed in dimples, brown’ stovepipe
pants with suspenders, a kid ’s Chicago Cubs baseball cap
and a shocking pink Baskin-Robbins workshirt with the
name Ed embroidered in the left corner. Smiling, he held the
tray high, like a professional waiter from Trader Vic’s or
someplace like that. “I thought you might want to do some of
the interview before we drive to Portland. . .”

t all began in France with no past~—Cheap Trick

that is. Rick and Tom Petersson met in the hinter-

lands of the United -States and, after traveling

through Europe, they connected with Bun E. Car-

los and Robin Zander in the south of France.
W'ithin months, the four came back to the States as Cheap
Trick. Right from the beginning, promoters, critics and
audiences noticed there was something very different about
this group. Cheap Trick lookedfunny, but this band was
not just another odd looking rock and roll band. There
was a sense of seriousness, balanced by a sense of humor
within the music. Not even the rock media has been able to
resist the visual diversity among the Tricksters: “the
cartoon-like, baseball-capped nephew ofHuntz Hall, lead
guitarist Rick Neilsen is so energetic he could kick himself
repeatedly in the head;” drummer Bun E. Carlos looks
and dresses like “a mustachioed Panamanian Sydney
Greenstreetg” “bass player Tom Petersson and lead
singer/rhythm guitarist Robin Zander are your standard
dolly-boy rockers.” Still, the odds against Cheap Trick
were centered around just that—what the band looked
like, not how they played.

“We’d play some places and promoters would come to
us and tell us we’d have to change. They told us we
couldn’t look like what we are,” says Rick. “They’d say,
‘you guys can’t go out there like that. Rick and Bun E., you
have to look more like Tom and Robin.’ One guy told me
to dress up and look like Jimi Hendrix and Bun E.————he
had to dress up like David Bowie. For what reason? people
always ask, ‘Did you guys do this on purpose?’ Of course
we didn’t. How can anyone force—that’sjust the way.we
are. And, I’m not going to change. I’m comfortable with
what I do. And, really,” he whispers, “the reason I wear a

Mohawk and with the hat I can walk down the street and
no one recognizes me.”

“VVell, I would wear suits,” confesses Bun E., “but it’s
just not practical on the road. For 50 years, drummers
have dressed like this—short sleeve shirts, comfortable
trousers and shoes—it’s only for the last 10 they haven’t.
Those guys that wear six-inch heels, you can’t drum like
that. But, how doyou feel, Tom, when they call you sisgz?”

Whether ormot Cheap Trick actually looks funny is
purely a subjective opinion, but this band’s looks have,
and will continue to have, an intrinsic drawing power.
W'hy? Because Robin, Tom, Bun E. and Rick are what
they appear to be—-it’s no gimmick, folks. And, while the
eccentric visual aspect may be what knocks most people
out oftheir chairs initially, it really isn’t all that relevant.
What is relevant———and the reason this band will endure———
is the music. The individual and combined talents ofTom,
Bun E., Rick and Robin are immediately striking, and the
songs, musically and lyrically, are addicting, straightfor-
ward, melodic rock and roll—at times a bit off the wall,
but always in control. Just listen to Cheap Trick or Cheap
Trick In Color: Robin’s voice is an instrument, and there’s a
blend in the vocal harmonies that’s hauntingly reminis-
cent ofthe Beatles; Rick’s guitar playing is as intriguing as
it is inventive; Bun E.’s drumming is superbly consis-
tent; and Tom’s bass riffs are mean but solid.

Cheap Trick doesn’t offer any extended or boring solos,
either in concert or on record; in fact, there’s a refreshing
lack of self-indulgence. They know where they’re going
musically and how long to stay. That is not to say, how-
ever, there are never any spotlight appearances. Rick’s

one-note solos (on one, sometimes two, ofhis more than 40.

guitars) are transforming him into rock’s version of the
Working Class Hero; Bun E.’s anti-drum solo (“It’s 16

- bars. If you go on much longer than that, who wants to

li'sten?.”)Gis the tasteful ideal; and Tom’s bass opening on
Trick’s version of Terry Reid’s “Speak Now or Forever
Hold Your Peace,” well, youjust can’t get enough ofit.
On stage, the enthusiasm behind the energy is deep-felt
and all but deﬁes analysis. And Cheap Trick audiences
are interesting to watch; they smile a lot. “I look for people
in the last row,” says Rick. “And the next time, they do
remember. We do go back to towns and they do re-
member. I’ve recognized people I’ve seen before and it

makes a lot of difference to us cause we want to be out

there.”
Rick romps from one end of the stage to another with
the energy of Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen, jump-

baseball cap is because I have a red, white and blue‘

ing atop stage speakers, ﬂipping picks to the audience.
\N'here most bass players are boring, Tom can be mes-
merizing. Breaking out of the bass players’ corner syn-
drome, Tom, occasionally prancing across the stage, be-
comes at times another lead guitar player. Though Cheap
Trick is Robin’s ﬁrst band, the 22-year-old lead vocalist
has the presence of someone who’s been singing before
sell-out crowds for 10 years. Knees bent and on his toes at
the microphone or strutting to the beat of the music,
Robin belts or croons the lyrics with all the power he’s got.
As the drummer, Bun E. is often overlooked, but his
ambidextrous, sometimes syncopated, talents set and
keep the pace of the tunes. Cheap Trick has that inherent
sense-—that feel for rock and roll. Perhaps the varied expe-
riences gathered from playing across Europe and the
influences, from Have Gun Will Travel (to which Rick
learned to play guitar) to the Beatles, Stones and Kinks
are partial reasons for that.

One night several years back, before Robin joined the
group, Rick, Tom and Bun E. played as Chuck Berry’s
pick-up band. It was one of those magic moments in rock
and roll. The rock legend—and the audience—were
amazed at what they heard. “He was ecstatic,” Tom re-
members. “Rick did solos———Chuck Berry let Rick do more
solos than he did. He gave Rick the spotlight and Chuck
Berry was all smiles.I learned more about the feel of rock
and roll from Chuck Berry than from almost all the years
I’ve played the instrument—-guitar, bass, anything. You
can’t really explain it,” says Tom, “but the man—he’s got
a feel for it.”

Both Cheap Trick and Cheap Trick In Color were recorded
in a relatively short period oftime. “We weren’t hurrying
to do them,” Rick says. “But we didn’t book an extra
month in the studio for the sake ofdoing an extra month.”
Rick writes most of the band’s material and 90 percent of
what he writes is with Robin’s voice in mind. “I am the
interpreter,” Robin explains, “and on stage I try to act out
the part of whatever Rick is.” Obviously, it’s working.
There’s a band in Chicago (Cheap Trick’s hometown)
now with a vocalist who’s trying to be just like Robin———
which he simply ca‘n’t=-do.

More often than not in the over-saturated market of
rock, accessibility is the key factor of success. Accessibility
is a major part of the Cheap Trick philosophy; playing as
much as possible is exactly_what this band wants to do.
“We play 1 1 months out ofthe year and record one,” says
Rick. “And that’s what it takes. Anybody’s in a dream
world if they’re thinking about anything but playing and
making good records. Some groups sit at home and think
‘I’m good.’ But we don’t want to sit at home. We hear
from other groups that stop touring for a year or a year and
a half and it makes no sense. Some say ‘Oh, we’re in the
sixth month of recording our new album and Ijust don’t
know what’s going on!’ That’s ridiculous. We plan to be in
the studio the first ofthe year to have our third album out
in the spring and I think our fourth album will be out by
next Christmas.” (Rick’s already written enough material

for ﬁve more albums.) ~
Only time can tell what Cheap Trick will come up with

next. (Would you believe different orchestras, including
the London Symphony Orchestra, marching bands and

the Vienna Choir Boys are being auditioned for future _

projects?) It may be when you least expect it, butCheap
Trick’s gonna get you.

hat the two actors do have in

common is movies, both

about to be released this

November, both from Uni-

versal, both dealing with
young men in crisis situations. The ﬁlms will
either allow them to make the transition
gracefully from television to movies, or will
push them, for a time at least, even further
behind the video lines. The movies: 9/30/55
for Richard Thomas, and Heroes for Henry
Winkler. Both ﬁlms are small, intensely
personal movies about relationships: these
from the studio that became rich marketing
Earthquake, Airport and jaws.

The subject matter of 9/30/55, coupled with
the studio’s reliance on conventional movie
fare to make them wealthy, leaves Richard
Thomas nervous. It isn’t that he doesn’t trust
Universal to give his ﬁlm a good shot; after
all, he reasons, they want to make money, but
he wonders aloud if they have the savvy to
market a difﬁcult movie. Advance word
around the studio is also mixed. Talk to some
executives and they’ll say 9/30/55, which
deals with the death of James Dean and the
effect it has on a few small town youths, is a
great movie, a slice of pure Americana. Talk
to others and they politely thumb their noses.
This kind of executive ambiguity doesn’t
make for comfort; but either way, whether
they praise or damn the ﬁlm, all the execs
agree it’s a hard sell.

So Thomas, apologizing 4 profusely for
being late ‘for the interview (he was caught in

“*4
’_3"...-». ..
..
'{.

. a

traffic) is doing whatever he can to promote
the movie. He ﬁgures his name gives the ﬁlm
a shot, but no more than that. “It’s a difficult
ﬁlm because it doesn’t have an immediately
identiﬁable audience,” he says after careful
consideration. “Universal knew they had to
put someone in it who would have a name
value, but I don’t think my name alone will
bring people into a theatre. My name will at
least make them consider it, though.”

enry Winkler, on the other hand,
is less circumspect. He is, after
all, a superstar. The jury may
still be out on his acting ability

(although he, like Thomas, has.

several Emmy nominations)—questions like,
“Can he act with his thumbs in his fist?” pop
up all the time——but no one questions his star
power. The opening segment of Happy Days
this season rang ABC’s coffers to the tune of a
52 share, the highest rating ever achieved by
a series. You can be sure those people tuned
in to see the Fonz. Henry. But the question is
whether_they will fork over $3.50 in a theatre
for what they can see at home for free.
Universal is interested in that question as
well and they spared no expense to get the
answer. They sneaked Heroes in Denver,
wrote down the names of all the people in the
audience and then called each one personally
to ﬁnd out whether they thought of Henry as
the Fonz or as jack, the Viet Nam vet. Ac-
cording to Henry the response was over-
whelmingly positive: no one thought about
the Fonz. Henry himselfwas in the audience

for that sneak and he later talked to his fans
when they surrounded the trailer in which he
was supposedly hiding.

Did the crowd want to talk about Heroes’,
about the pain and suffering ofthe Viet Nam
war? No, said Henry, what they wanted to
say was how much the movie touched them.
How they cried. Henry (no one ever calls him
Hank and no one ever would) also cried. ‘_‘I
hate blase people,” he says with enough
energy to keep several homes in electric
lights. “Actors in this town who say they
don’t give a damn about anything bore me to
death. I love what’s happening. I worked for
it and getting that feedback from people it
terriﬁc.”

Positive feedback isn’t necessarily some-
thing Henry’s always received. While his
wealthy parents encouraged his acting
career, more than a few of his teachers at Yale
University, where he holds a Masters Degree
in Fine Arts (acting), told him he didn’t
stand a chance. “I was told I ’d never make it
as an actor,” says Henry who now earns
more in a week than it costs to attend Yale for
all four years. “I was told I wasn’t good
enough, I wasn’t tall enough.‘I wasn’t good
looking enough. People told me all the time I
was too ugly to be a leading man. I suppose
they thought it was constructive criticism. I
didn’t think it was constructive. Now I say
‘fuck you’ to those people every Tuesday
night.” Henry also intends to say the same
from theatres across the country when Heroes
opens. » - z

not getting lost in the shuffle.”

 
    

ichard, on the other hand, had no
such problems. He began acting
as a child, a natural outgrowth of
growing up in New York, the son
‘  ' of theatrical parents who run one
of the most well—respected ballet schools in
Manhattan. From his ﬁrst movie, Winning
and his ﬁrst year as john-Boy on The Waltons,
Richard was pegged as a winner. He came
along at a time when sensitive young actors,
who also seemed normal, were at a premium.
As the oldest Walton child, Richard created a
well-spring of good-will that was staggering.
When he announced earlier this year that he
would not return to the show for the new
season, CBS went into a panic. For a series
that has over 11 regulars, including such
venerable talents as Will Geer, it was a little
disconcerting to have a show’s success rest
with one young man.

Richard, his ﬁve year contract‘ with The
Waltons honored to completion, wishes the
show well, and may even come back once or

twice for specials. “It wasn’t monotonous 

all. I loved doing the series,” he says one
more time, having probably repeated the
phrase often enough to ﬁll four volumes of the
Encyclopedia Britannica. “But there came a
point in my life when I felt I had to move on. I
have nothing against television, though. I’d
be glad to come back and do something I
believe in. What I like about television is the
influence you can have. You reach millions of
people. When you’re making a statement it’s

as

That can also be said for Henry VVinkler’s
Fonz. There’s hardly a kid in America, ages
six to sixteen, who can’t “do” the Fonz.

way from the Happy Days set,
Henry is almost disturbingly
unlike the Fonz. It’s almost
impossible to see even glimpses
. of the 50’s biker with greased
hair and a leather jacket. Henry’s hair is
chopped short, the face is decidedly contem-
porary and his frailness seems contradictory
to the enormous power of his television im-
age. He is also articulate, smart and well
aware ofhis television attractiveness. V

But the obvious conﬁdence has ﬂaws. He’s
jumpy and a chain smoker. He’s polite, but
he also likes to express anger, taking pleasure
in emotional outbursts. A quick look at the
Heroes press kit turns Henry into a rage.
“Shit,” he says, madly pointing to a single
writing credit for the screenplay. “

 

ames
Carabatsos didn’t write it, he only wrote the
ﬁrst draft. It was re-written by a really fine
writer, David Freeman, and all Freeman gets
is a thank—you at the end ofthe ﬁlm.” Henry
also takes a look at the still—photo set and
throws out an unﬂattering picture ofdirector
Jeremy Paul Kagan, who also directed
Henry in Katharine on television. Later Henry
will disclose he dislikes most interviews,
claiming they’re total bores. “The guy from
the (Ilzrzstlan Srienee Alonitor was here yester-
day; my plant was more interesting.”

ichard, however, does resemble
his TV alter-ego, John Walton.
Like his series counterpart,
Richard is intelligent, earnest
and thoughtful, but all those pos-
itives don’t really add upto a very exciting
person: Richard seems oddly one-
dimensional. Although ﬁrst impressions,
particularly those gleaned under the artiﬁcial
contrivance of an interview, are rarely reli-
able, the snapjudgment is that Richard lacks
I fire, lacks quirks. It comes across in his acting
as well. While he’s always credible, there’s
something unexciting about Richard (who,
like Henry, is never called by a nickname);
he’s like a pane of glass; it’s difficult to ﬁnd
crevices on which to hang a personality.
That smoothness makes his 9/30/5.5 char-

 

“ ‘° '~ acter, named Jimmy, something of a con-

tradiction. Jimmy is a man who desperately
wants to be someone special, a true rebel with
a cause, but as Richard himself says, “Jim-
my’s not halfas misunderstood as he’d'like to
be. Actually he’s pretty well adjusted to his
surroundings. Everyone likes him [note: the
same is said ofRichard]; he’s a good student,
he’s popular, he’s on the football team, his
motherhas her limitations, but she’s a good

lady. All this and he wants to be on the out-
side. That’s what he gets from identifying so
strongly with James Dean. He gets to be a
rebel.”

When Dean is killed in a car crash,Jimmy
goes quietly crazy, and demands that his
friends share the same turmoil. “But you
can’t expect people to feel your grief the way
you feel it,” warns Richard, drinking coffee

sweetened into sugar oblivion. “Jimmy

wants to bring everyone down, wants
everyone to be mired in unhappiness, but it
just doesn’t work that way. Jimmy isn’t all
thabpositive a character, he causes things to
happen and then he walks away. He certainly
isn’t good for Billie Jean. He has to walk
away, of course, that’s what the movie is all
about. Cutting loose from things. Jimmy
knows he has to get out of the Midwest. He
knows he has to ﬁnd the World outside. We all
have to break out. That’s what Hollywood is
forJimmy—the world outside, that’s why he
has to go ﬁnd it. But when it comes right

' down to it, Jimmy is really very ’main—

stream.”

enry’s character in Heroes, how-
ever, is anything but main-
stream. A brutalized Viet Nam
veteran, Winkler plays a man
barely able to deal with reality.
We first see him wandering around New
York City, trying to keep young men from
becoming soldiers. Henry, who was in college
during the Viet Nam years, says he couldn’t

 

imagine going off to War. “They’re people I

just like us,” he says ofthe soldiers. “I don’t
know how anyone survives it, mentally. It’s
got to destroy you on some level. Those that
aren’t destroyed by the experience, go into
battle somehow crippled, like all those mer-
cenaries. People all over the world will ﬁght
for money.

“I could see ﬁghting to defend this coun-
try, I’d do that,” he concedes, ﬁngering the
cover of the Vivien Leigh biography he’s

been reading. “But the Viet Nam war was,

fought to defend the egos of men who
couldn’t admit they had made a mistake.
How many thousands of lives were lost to
keep those egos salved. It was a tragedy.
Heroes doesn’t deal directly with the war, but
it’s an undercurrent, it’s always there. Actu-
ally it’s a love story (co-starring Sally Field),
a movie about people. But what shaped Jack
was the War and he can’t forget it. In that
way I think the movie has something impor-
tant to say.” ‘
Henry was, to a great extent, a child ofthe
60’s, and those turbulent times shaped his life
in the same way the \/\/'ar shaped Jack’s. “I
lived in a commune at Yale,” Henry ex-
plains. “It was near the beach. There were a
bunch of us, lawyers, an architect, I was the
only actor. People from the Hog Farm com-
mune came and lived with us; and then

people from the South Coast environmental
commune. Both those experiences changed
me radically. They really altered me. What I
want to be in my fantasies is spontaneous.
I’m not a spontaneous person at all; I’m very
structured. I truly believe that freedom
comes from structure and tradition, but I still
wish I could be spontaneous. The commune
living opened me up.

“I have a friend ofmine who’s an absolute
hero. You know why he’s a hero to me? Be-
cause he’s the only man I know who can leave
his house in the morning without a plan. -He
just gets into his car and drives. I love that.
God, ifI could only do without plans.”

Henry has other heroes of course, includ-
ing George Burns. He met Burns the other
night at a celebrity packed screening of Oh,
God, directed by Carl Reiner, who also di-
rected Henry in his other motion picture, The
One and Only. “George Burns is so wonderful
as God, all I could do was kiss him. I couldn’t
even tell him how good he was. Then George
told me he watched Happy Days all the time
and thought my comic timing was impecca-
ble. He used that word,” Henry says, marvel-
ling. “Impeccable. To hear that from some-
one like George Burns is the greatest thing
that could happen to me. The greatest thrill
is having people in your own profession tell
you you’re good.”

 

 r Richard, the people from whom
he’d like to hear the praise are
Spencer Tracy and Charles
Laughton. An impossibility, of
. course. James Dean doesn’t really
ﬁgure in the litany at all. “I was about four
when he died, so it was real hard for _me to be
affected,” he smiles. “I like him as an actor,
of course, I admire what he did. But I also
think he unleashed a whole style of acting
that’s unfortunate, a kind of inarticulateness
which we’re only now getting away from. It’s
like Hemingway. He’s a ﬁne writer, but all
those imitators are just terrible. Or a poetry
class in college, you can always tell who’s
been reading e.e. Cummings by the poems the
students are writing.”
While Richard understands the kind of
hero worship that would have driven Jimmy
in 9/30/55 to temporary madness, in his own

‘life, he can’t really pinpoint that kind of

inﬂuence. “The strongest inﬂuence on your
life ought to be your parents,” he says.
“That’s true in my life and I think that’s a
positive inﬂuence. Oh, I can remember when
I was six being real inﬂuenced by Bugs
Bunny, but I don’t think my parents were
threatened.” What would he do ifhe saw his
own son emulating someone ofwhom he did
not approve? “I’d try to ﬁnd a way to re-

direct his energy. It’s funny, he’s only 18
months, but I can already see patterns form-
ing. Our lives are shaped so early.”

Richard is married to a former social
worker, a Chicana woman five years his
senior. Henry decries the lack of marriage
contenders, dates frequently, but stays away
from column-seeking actresses. He says he’s
pretty open himself, but he does concede
everyone has skeletons. “We all have some-
thing to hide,” he admits. “But I say use your
experiences, the good and the bad. That’s
what acting is all about. Using those things. I
remember when I was at Yale, I’d go out
with a girl for about six months, and she’d
inevitably tell me about her abortion. I don’t
know why they told me, maybe they felt
guilty, unclean or something. Anyway, it
never mattered to me. . .I think you are what
you are at the moment and that’s it.”

Could a friend reveal something about
himself/herselfthat would destroy the friend-
ship? “I never thought about it,” says Henry,
puzzled. “My first impression is to say,
drugs, but I’m not sure. I’m very anti—drugs,
but I know people can get offthem, so that
doesn’t really apply. I don’t know how to
answer that question. I’ll think about it. I
can’t answer now.”

In the next few months, the audience will
determine whether Henry VVinkler and
Richard Thomas become movie attractions.
Until the cards are in, Henry will be working
on a new season for Happy Days and Richard
will star in David Rabe’s searing. Viet Nam

Boogie Men

The Rolling Stones:

Love You Live (Rolling Stones Records)
Foghat Live (Bearsviile)
Status Quo Live (Capitol)
Silver Earring Live (MCA)

For many, rock and roll is primarily good-
time music, an area where subtlety and lyri-
cism are as out ofplace as an owl in a barrel of
monkeys. That crowd would probably agree
that the music is best heard in person, rather
than through studio recordings, arguing that
all of that concentration and overdubbing
can only rob rock and roll of its intrinsic
spontaneity. When those fans go to a show,
it’s to drink, smoke, and party. Me too, and
the drunker, the smokier, and the louder the
better! V

The end of this year promises a feast for the
ear; just about everybody who’s been touring
over the last several months seems to have
been in the process of recording a live album
for pre-Christmas release. Here are four who

‘are first out ofthe stall.

The Rolling Stones were once the world’s
favorite get-up-and-boogie band, but if their
latest" album is any indication none of the

quintet save for bassist Bill Wyman and.

drummer Charlie Watts can get themselves
up anymore. The three sides recorded at a
Paris concert last year are so flabby that no
other band would have the nerve to release
them —— but if there’s one thing that the
Stones have never lacked, bless ’em, it’s

nerve. Sound recording quality is subpar,
and it’s difiicult to believe that a number of
decent technicians recorded and mixed it
(the LP is dedicated to one of the engineers,
Keith Harwood, who evidently died after -
or, more likely, during —— the sessions. If he
were alive, to reactivate a pertinent
Goldwynism, he’d turn over in his grave).

Side three, cut a year later in Toronto,
sounds better. It’s as though the Stones pre-
fer cutting vintage Chicago blues, like the
kind they began their career with, to their
own stuff. Can’t blame them for that, can we?

The most boogie of the bunch is provided
by Status Quo, a British group who have
been slogging it out on the road longer than
many of today’s bands have been at their in-
struments. Their specialty is the one-or-two
chord shuffle; their shows can consist of an
hour and a half of such stuff. Not surpris-
ingly, and much to the disgust of more seri-
ous musicians everywhere, the band is
hugely popular. This is their first live album,
both discs ofit, and provides a fine introduc-
tion to newcomers as well as an excellent
souvenir to long-time fans.

It was recorded in Scotland, which seems
to be Britain’s version ofCleveland or Detroit
so far as providing hot audiences for hot
music. The band burns and the fans steam
through nearly a full-length concert set, in-
cluding versions of Chuck Berry’s “Bye Bye,
Johnny,” The Doors’ “Roadhouse Blues,”
and a passel of band originals. Andy Bown

sits in on piano, in honor ofthe recording. It’s
highly recommended, especially at lease-
breaking time.

Second choice would be Foghat, again a
bete noir with the critics and a favorite of
everybody who really matters; if they were
just a little more outrageous personally,
they’d be bigger than Grand Funk were and
Kiss is. As it stands, they’re apparently too
busy on the road to worry about image-
making. Aone-disc affair, their concert LP
was recorded in upstate New York, not all
that far from where the three Britons and one
American live.

Songs include long-time Foghat standards
“Fools for the City,” “I just Want to Make
Love to You,” and “Road Fever,” plus their
monster hit “Slow Ride,” an especially
breakneck version of“Honey Hush,” and the
group composition “Home in My Hand”
which sounds almost exactly like the Ronnie
Self classic of the same name. The album is
virtually a “Best of. . .” the band, and gives
the listener an opportunity to recycle all ofits
predecessors to friends or Goodwill bins.

Since their deserved hit “Radar Love,” a
couple ofyears back, we haven’t heard much
from Golden Earring, which holds the dis-
tinction (.9) of being Holland’s number one
boogie band. Their new album, again two
discs, was recorded “in Europe,” over an un-
specified period of time and with personnel
who are assumed to be such household
names that they aren’t even listed on the

November, 197 7

package (Quick: name one member of Gol-
den Earringl).

“Radar Love” is here, twelve minutes or so
ofit, plus ten minutes of“Eight Miles High"
and several band compositions (by vocalist
Barry Hay and guitarist George Kooymans;
there, that’s [IEO members). The album is
largely instrumental, which is fine, consider-
ing the quality of the lyrics. On the other
hand, Golden Earrings‘ English is a lot better
than most ofour Dutch, so we can’t put them
down too badly.

MCA has, identical with most of their
two-disc packages, screwed up the listing of
tracks on the cover and made the labels all
but impossible to read. Hence this Ampersand
consumers tip: get four small, white, stickon
labels and number them from “l" to “-1.”
Place “I” conspicuously on the record label
designated “record one, first heat.” Number
‘“ ” goes on “record two, second heat,"
(that’s the one with “Eight Miles High”);
number “3” goes on “record two, third heat"
(the one with “To the Hilt”); and number
“4” goes on the only side that doesn‘t already
have a small, white, stick—on label. Play the
album in that order to approximate that of
the concert, and pay no attention to the order
listed inside the double—foldjacket.

If, that is, you’re not too drunk or
smoked-out to read the labels or manipulate
the gummed tabs.

Millie Jackson:

Feelin’ Bitchy (Spring)
Ann Peebles:

If This is Heaven (Hi)
Dorothy Moore (Malaco)

What with Aretha Franklin abdicating her
throne in favor ofa slicked-down approach to
recording, therc’s an opening for Queen of
Soul. Gladys Knight doesn’t qualify; she set
the path to middle-of-thc—road that Aretha is
trying to follow. Tina Turner is somewhere
on her way to Las Vegas; and Mavis Staples
has all but disappeared.

Not that there aren‘t contenders. Take
these three, for instance. From Georgia.
Missouri, and Mississippi, respectively,
Jackson, Peebles and Moore are working
hard at reaching the heights of across—the—
board popularity that Franklin had achieved
in the Sixties, back before she made a definite
stab at “crossing over.”

Each of the three has gone a long way
toward reaching the goal, one way or an-
other. Peebles has the longevity: her first
single hit in the soul charts since 1969. Moore
has the record sales: her versions of “Misty
Blue” (on an earlier album) and “I Believe
You” ( included here) have been huge hits.
And Jackson has both the looks — she’s an
absolute stunner — and the funkiness.

The Moore and Peebles albums come as
distinct disappointments in contrast to ear-
lier work. Moore’s is a relatively lushly-
produced search for a followup to “Misty
Blue,” and Peebles and her producer, Willie
Mitchell, are as usual too insistent on keep-
ing the source ofthe material recorded within
their families. Still, each LP has its moments,
with a lengthy sob-provoking rendition of
“With Pen in Hand” and the gospel-tinged
original “Too Blind to See” the highlights of

Dorothy Moore, and a sultry reading of ().V.» ‘ ‘

VVright’s 1965 hit “You Gonna Make Me
Cry” the standout on Peebles’. Both albums
are held back by formula arrangements on
most of the tunes, and what sound like quick-
ie production; both artists are capable of far
better.

jackson’s latest LP, on the other hand, is a
knockout. Some ofthe material is unsuitable
for airplay, dealing as it does with matters of
love and lust in a most fundamental manner.
jackson’s long monologue on how to satisfy a

man (and I’ll bet she knows) should liven up a

$3! of parties before this album goes out of

Te. Other material includes strong soul
renditions of a couple of country songs, fol-
lowing the example of fellow Spring act Joe
Simon: last year’s Barbara Fairchild hit
“Cheatin’ Is,” and this year’s Merle Hag-
gard success, “lfWe’re Not Back in Love by
Monday.”

The arrangements are carefully thought
out, setting atmosphere without cluttering,
in the manner of“Ode to Billy Joe” or some
of what Norman Whitﬁeld used to do when
he was at Motown. And jackson’s vocals
range from sensual to out-and-out provoca-
tive throughout.

To be truthful, Aretha Franklin doesn’t yet
have much to worry about, particularly ifshe
discovers the error of her ways within the
next couple of albums (she might: one with

‘ﬁurtis Mayﬁeld is in the works). But,_zf she

Charles Mingus:
Three or Four Shades of Blues (Atlantic)
Ron Carter Quartet:
Piccolo (Milestone)

In an age of electronic instruments -
many of which exist primarily because
they’re. cheaper to manufacture, easier to
carry around and play, and louder than the
acoustic versions that their manufacturers
claim to emulate —— it’s refreshing to see some
holdout musicians.

But this review isn’t here because Charles

ﬁgiingus and Ron Carter play acoustic bass -

which they both do — but because they and

_ their bands are creating some of the best

music to be heard anywhere, and which is
well represented on their current albums.
Mingus has been jazz’s preeminent
bassist-composer for a good 20 years, and his
career goes back further still. Though his
playing is consistently dazzling, perhaps his
greatest skill is as a writer and arranger.
Many of Mingus’s albums contain a virtual
history of jazz, so complete is his knowledge
and facility. The man refuses to be tied to an
idiom; though Ellington and the blues are his
primary inﬂuences, his bands have featured
(and sometimes given early exposure to)
such modernists as Roland Kirk, Eric Dol-
hy, Mal Waldron,_]aki Byard, Ted Curson,

"éqﬁtil Bley, john Handy, Charlie Mariano,

John F addis, Don Pullen, andjack Walrath.
The current Mingus group, at least as of
the sessions earlier this year (why are no
dates given?), consists of Walrath on trum-.
pet; Ricky Ford on tenor; pianist Bob
Neloms; and Mingus’ drummer since 1956.
There’s no doubt that the band could have
given a more than worthy performance on
their own. But the standout feature here is a
series of guest performers including guitarists
Larry Corycll, Philip Catherine, and John
Scoﬁeld; reed giants Sonny Fortune and
George Coleman; bassist George Mraz; and
pianist Jimmy Rowles. Though not all play
on every selection, all are given room, and
each provides eloquent proof that he is
among the best musicians around (Rowles,
at 59 being the “old man” of the band,
 "e.t‘theless plays stunningly during his

  

  

.,~e'gments and keeps his head more than

above the musical waters).

The compositions, all Mingus originals,
include reprises of his two “greatest hits”:
“Better Get It In Your Soul” and “Goodbye,
Pork-Pie Hat,” the latter being the Lester
Young tribute that has been recorded by a
number of musicians, many of them
guitarists’, includingjohn Renbourn and Jeff
Beck. Mingus has never, at least to my

Ampersand

knowledge, recorded with guitarists prior to

this album.

Perhaps the chief virtue of Three or Four
Shades (fBlues, though, is not the instrumen-
tal virtuosity, or even the scholarship inher-
ent in all of Mingus’ work. What makes this
album astandout amongjazz LPs ofthe past
several years is the fact that every bar of the
music reflects pure joy on the part of the
composer and the players, fun that’s down-
right contagious. There’s never been a better
introduction to the glories ofjazz than a
Mingus album (mine was Blues and Roots),
and Three or Four Shades QfBlll€S ranks among
the Very best.

Carter earned his Master’s in music in
1961, and went on to play with Miles Davis
(the V.S.O.P. band) for three years before
becoming a sought-after freelance and con-
stant poll winner (Down Beat’s‘ critics’ and
readers’ surveys for the past seven years,
among others). i ,

Piccolo is }arter’s first recording with his
current quartet, and a two-disc live affair
recorded at a New York City club, Sweet
Basil, that they regularly play. The group is
at ease in the environment, and though
they’re never sloppy, the comfort shows in
their work.

Carter plays half-sized “piccolo” bass
throughout the album, using it as a front—line
instrument as others would a horn, guitar, or
piano. Buster Williams plays second bass in
its usual, rhythm-keeping, role; Ben Riley is
the drummer; and Kenny Barron (another
academic — he teaches music full-time at
Rutgers, and has since 1973) plays piano.

Tunes include a couple of st_rong Carter
originals, including “Little Waltz,” first
heard in Miles’ version; plus standards like
“Blue Monk,” a jaunty “Three Little
Words,” and bassist Oscar Pettiford’s not-
so-standard “Laverne Waltz.”

The music is ﬁne throughout, with the tape
edited so that there’s no dialogue or other
distraction, and the album provides the

additional distinction of being a whale of a

work-out for your record-playing equipment.
Take this to the store the next time you’re
auditioning speakers, and you’ll be assured
of at least a strong bottom end!

Hank-Thompson, Freddy Fender,
Roy Clark, and Don Williams:
Country Comes to Carnegie Hall (ABC).

Four respected country musicians, all
under contract to ABC/Dot Records, each
get a side of this two-disc compilation, ap-

parently recorded live at Carnegie Hall last‘

May during a concert and radio broadcast.
Thompson makes music in the western swing
tradition and sounds great on “Oklahoma
Hills,” “Wild Side of Life” (he had the origi-
nal hit), “A Six Pack to Go,” and a couple
more; Fender performs his hits “Before the
Next Teardrop Falls,” “Wasted Days and
Wasted Nights” plus “El Rancho Grande,”
“After the Fire Is Gone,” and a throwaway
“_]ambalaya;” and Williams croons five of his
hits (including “Til the Rivers All Run Dry,”
recently cut by Pete Townshend and Ronnie
Lane in the wake of Williams’ phenomenal
British popularity), and no filler.

Clark devotes most of his side to comedy
and-— especially — hot guitar picking, with
one piece by electric banjoist Buck Trent.

_ The album’s a good buy, but more than
anything else proves that each of these artists
deserves a live album in his own right; so far,
only Clark has one. It also proves that these
guys sound as good in concert as they do in a
recording studio. Rock bands should have

such consistent quality!

Drugs & Sex

Phillip K. Dick, one of the best writers in
the English language today, has produced

~ the ultimate drug novel — the most intense,

most frightening, most compassionate. A
Scanner Darkly (Doubleday, $6.95) is set in the
near future, but mostly suggests the recent
past. The titular scanner is a sophisticated
monitoring device, an unblinking eye upon a
drug pusher called Bob Arctor, who is also an

undercover narcotics officer called Fred. He .

thinks. And is, of course. But . . . No one has
got drug dialogue down on paper better, nor
written with more eerie accuracy I about

:drug-induced paranoia —— the giddy mis-

ﬁring of synapse, the gaudy warring of the
brain’s hemispheres. A Scanner Darkly is a su-
perbly crafted book, and a chilling one, and

A even, in some crazy way, a very funny one.

But Dick is serious: the characters in his book
are based on characters in his life, most of
them dead or severly damaged by. now. “If
there was any ‘sin’,” he writes in an Author’s
Note, “it was that these people wanted to
keep having a good time forever, and were
punished for that, but . . . the punishment
was far too great.”

Roger Vadim’s arrogance is engaging. His
Memoirs of the Devil (Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, $7.95) — and I am pleased to
report that he seems to mean his title with at
least a bit of self-parody — promises to be a
brash, self-serving, sensationalistic auto-
biography (the loud‘dust-jacket, black and
red, shows a devil’s head above portraits of
Bardot,_]ane Fonda, and Catherine Deneuve
— Vadim’s three most famous mates), but
turns out to be a rather calm, unsophisti-
cated, amusing chronicle ofan interesting lit-
tle life. His posturing is unconvincing, and it
is as though he doesn’t mean it to convince —-—
as ifhe knows that we know that the horns he

has worn are not the devil’s.
Colman Andrews

Doingjustice

We grouse from the speciﬁc to the generic.
If our flight is overbooked, we denounce the
airline, and perhaps the airline industry.
Made to wait in line for a book of stamps, we
condemn the inefficiency of the postal sys-
tem. Given a questionable diagnosis by a
physician, we impugn the integrity of the
medical profession.

Over a ﬁve-year period, Anne Strick (who
was married to writer-directorjoseph Strick)
found herself thrust into the American legal
system, “in a spectrum of unrelated matters
[surely matters in a spectrum are related?]
. . . serving variously as a witness and char-
acter witness, defendant, plaintiff, and juror,
in cases both civil and criminal.” She was
disturbed by much ofwhat she saw, and thus
her grouse, expectedly, picks at the very
bases of Western jurisprudence.

Strick’s book, Injustice for All (Putnam,
$8.95), is subtitled “How Our Adversary
System of Law Victimizes Us and Subverts
True Justice.” It is Strick’s thesis that the
adversary system, which she deﬁnes as “a
method of dispute settlement that requires all
persons who go to law to settle differences, to
behave as enemies,” is an outmoded, per-

-nicious descendent of the primitive or reli-

gious traditions of trial by ordeal or trial by

battle — and that it ought to be done away
with entirely.

It is a brave thesis for a lay person to
present, and an ambitious one. Strick is a
casual observer of the legal system at best

‘ (ﬁve years of mostly involuntary participa-

tion in trial cases, however various, is still
casual observation), but she has tackled what
is perhaps its central weakness. It is rather as
if a ﬁve-year veteran of local politics con-
ceived a plan to substitute some new legisla-
tivebody for the American Congress —— an
admirable idea, some might say, but a rather
ostentatious one considering its provenance.

Strick has done an impressively far-
reaching job of research (her notes cite
sources as diverse as Simon Greenleafs Law
cf Evidence, the works of Roscoe Pound, New
York magazine, and Bartlett’s Familiar Quota-
tions), and has obviously put a good lot of
serious and original thinking into her book.
But she is sometimes embarrassingly naive,
as when she suggests a causal connection be-
tween court congestion and such things as
the automobile industry’s “freedom to ‘sell
cars with built-in defects that they know will
kill people,”’ states blithely that “Archaic
laws must be excised from the books,” or
holds that “It is essential for the entire justice
system to stand at the greatest possible re-
move from Authority’s thumb.” Worse than
that, though, is her presumption that an ad-
mittedly imperfect system must be totally re-
jected.

A great deal ofstrong, hard work has been
done, for centuries, on the problems of the
inequities of legal process —-— from Cesare di

irsand

 "lnPrint””

Beccaria onwards —-— and what the best of it
has added up to is not destruction ofa system

Missives

H.L. Mencken, the great American jour-
nalist, editor, critic, satirist, and wit —-— the
ruthless foe of prudery and pretense, the man
who coined “Bible Belt,” “smuthound,” and
“booboisie,” the man who openly admitted,
“My prejudices are innumerable, and often
idiotic,” and whose attitude toward art be
deemed inferior is defined by his remarks
about a certain poet: “I refuse to apologize
for saying that his so-called poetry is rotten
and defend myself on the ground that the
pain caused by my saying so will tend to
make it less rotten in the future.” -—- is said to
have written 100,000 letters during his
career. The New Mencken Letters, edited by our
leading Mencken scholar, Carl Bode (Dial,
$19.95), is a 635-page collection of, well, a
few of them. In 1961, Knopf issued Letters of
H.L. Mencken, edited by a French Mencken
specialist named Guy F orgue. These “new”
letters are all different, though many of them
are to the same people at the same period as
F orgue’s letters, and deal with many of the
same concerns. Bode criticizes Forgue for the
preponderance of letters to Theodore Dreiser
in his collection; Bode might be criticized
himself for the inclusion of a good many thor-
oughly superﬂuous little notes in his (rejec-
tion letters, an order for cigars, etc.). But the
volume as a whole is fascinating and wonder-
ful to have —-— a rich vein from an immense

lode ofgreat wit and strong opinion. C A

Rolling Thunder Reviewed  

Bob Dylan and his Rolling Thunder Revue
(including joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg,
Bobby Neuwirth, Ramblin’ jack Elliot and
dozens more) went through New England
back in the winter of ’75. It was an unusual
tour of small towns with little or no advance
hype—just the music and the audiences.
There was to be a ﬁlm of it all, for which
playwright Sam Shepard was hired to write
“on-the-spot dialogue for all the heavies.”
The film was shelved, and The Rolling Thunder
Logbook (Viking, $12.50), kept by Shepard
during the tour, is perhaps two years too late.

Shepard seemsjust a little too awed by ol’
Bob; he rarely questions the self-indulgence
but instead takes everything in stride. Of
course; he was being paid by Dylan to take
everything in stride.

Shepard’s best chapters (and the man can
certainly write when he isn’t laboring over
descriptions of rock and roll) emerge when
Dylan isn’t around: a short chilling para-
graph called “Pilgrim Fear;” an episode in
search of his laundry in a huge motel, during
which search Shepard is intrigued and hum-
bled by the sound of a lone cricket; and sev-
eral pithy remarks about road madness——the
excitement of mobility, the relief that you
don’t have to stay in those dreary little towns,
the sense of alienation, as ifeverything else is
the Real World—or, nothing else is real.

But Shepard turns himselfinside out look-
ing for ways to describe the music and con-
cert thrills, ways to describe the Wonder and
Importance of it all, falling back on cliches
like “it takes the roof off,” or “the volcano

Thunder Logbook.

erupts,” and so on. Shepard gets almost
misty and mystical discussing Dylan on
stage, but Dylan offstage is a murky, lurking
presence, and it’s never really clear what
Shepard thinks of him. Shepard reports a
Thanksgiving dinner with impersonal but ef-
fective journalese, the kind of scene, replete
with bone-throwing, table-pounding hys-
teria, that could be considered amusing, or
Fellini-esque, or primitive, or just prima
donna. I’d like to know Shepard’s opinion,
but he doesn’t offer any.

The book jacket calls Shepard’s a “love-
hate relationship” with rock and roll,‘ and
there is quite a bit oflove in this book, for the
music, at least. A little hate scattered here
and there might have been more interesting.

The pictures are nice—but not $12.50

really stand out in importance: Alla
Nazimova, the great screen temptress and
Valentino’s first leading lady; and Natacha
Rambova, the New York-born designer who
married and dominated Valentino after first
ending her affair with Nazimova.
Unfortunately the women are given very
little motivation and one is left constantly
wonderingjust why people are behaving the
way they are. Miscasting is part of the
problem. Leslie Caron as Nazimova wanders
around looking like a reject from a Fellini
film, while Michelle Phillips’ Rambova is
cold and superficial. What Valentino ever
saw in her is beyond comprehension.
Strangely enough, the surprise acting
success belongs to Nureyev. He is child-like
and touching as the doomed Valentino and
his natural style and elegance serve the role
well. As might be expected, he is most
dazzling when dancing and an all-too-brief
sequence where he teaches the legendary
Nijinski (played by ballet star Anthony
Dowell) to tango is electrifying. Also exciting
is a comic tap-dance when he leaves the
gigolo world behind and a violent duel with
Fatty Arbuckle where Valentino dances with
the fat man’s girlfriend at a'cabaret and
succeeds in seducing her.
VVhat’s ultimately missing from Valentino is
a guiding passion. A movie where no

. one wants anything more than a close-up is

oddly boring. J_A_

Benin! DEERFIE-EB; with Al Pacino; Marthe
Keller, Anny Duperey; written by Alvin Sar-
gent, produced and directed by Sydney Pol-
lack.

Bobby Deerﬁeld is advertised and promoted as
a love story, but anyone wanting teary-eyed
sentimentality will be disappointed. As its
singular title suggests, Bobby Deerfield is act_u-
ally a psychological investigation into the
makeup of one man—a race car driver who
learns about the emotional give and take of
living by falling in love with a dying woman.
Based on Erich Maria Remarque’s l930’s
romantic novel, Heaven Has No Favorites, Deer-
field has been transformed into a highly con-
temporary drama with a brittle and witty
script from Alvin Sargent and intelligent and
demanding direction by Sydney Pollack.
W'here other movies go for thejugular, Deer‘-«f
ﬁeld aims for the heart by way of the brain,
and the detachment pays off with startling
success. A
Al Pacino, intense, self-centered and
egotistical, is compelling as Deerfield. For
perhaps the first time in his career, we are
allowed to see a charming, almost playful
side to his nature. Pacino as Dieerfield isn’t
afraid to laugh; nor is he afraid to make a
cinematic fool of himself, as when he tries,
unsuccessfully, to mimic Mae West. Pacino
personiﬁes with brilliant understatement a
certain kind of ‘urban, ambitious man who
lost the ability to cry somewhere along the
line. ..
Playing Lillian, the enigmatic woman
whose constant questioning of Deerﬁeld ﬁ-
nally breaks through his protective barriers,
is Swiss-born actress Marthe Keller, pr(jV"“.
iously seen in Black Sunday and A/Iarathon Ma):-. t
Keller is a strong, almost overpowering ac-
tress, who brings to her role an impeccable
sense of self and a wry sense of humor.
Bobby Deerjield is a ﬁnely tuned movie un-
encumbered by audience expectations about
what a love story should offer. Like its char-
acters, Bobby Deerfield is a cool, somewhat de-
tached movie: ‘vulnerable without being
sentimental; tender without losing control}

Heard from Farrah
Elton Lately?

Then You Know Something
About Fan Mail Services 

BYCYNTHIA KIRK

Murray Small is about as talkative as G. Gordon Liddy‘
when it comes down to discussing how he’s made his
living for the last 24 years. He says it might upset the _
general public, not to mention the general order 0 
things, for word to get around about his organization. A
Mafiosi hitman? An undercover narc? A spy? You’v
been watching too much television.

Murray Small answers fan mail for a living, as
president of one of the fan mail biggies, United Fan Mail
Service of Hollywood. Although reporters for publica-
tions as diverse as The National Enquirer and TV_ Guide
have been bugging him for years for the inside dirt, Mur-
ray Small and his fellow fan mail handlers aren’t talking.

“We don’t want to let them know we exist,” he says,
“them,” of course, meaning you. His rationale for all that
secrecy is as firmly rooted in reality as the entertaiment
industry which spawned his business in the first place.
Murray Small, and the handful of other fan mail service
operators in Los Angeles, still believe that YOU still be-
lieve that Farrah Fawcett-Majors personally readsall I
your words of undying adoraton, and then rushes to the
mail box with a reply. ’ =

The truth, Small concedes, is quite to the contrary.

“The only way the stars get involved is to pick out the
picture we send out,” he mutters.

Nevertheless, Small continues to nurture the illusion
that our hand-picked royalty still possess the common
touch. His unspoken but obvious message is that the
people who write fan letters would be crushed to learn
that Murray Small reads their innermost thoughts and
then licks the stamp which carries their idol’s reply back
to them.

Although another fan mail maven, VIP Fan Mail Serv-
ice president Larry Kleno, claims that somegstars do get
more involved, and even occasionally supply ‘his service
with information for a ‘_‘personal’’ response to a fan’s
question, according to Small, that’s the rare exception. v
For the most part, fans ge’t-*"'itﬁpe’rsonal, mass-produced
items like pictures; official -—- and therefore generally
skimpy — biographies; and, in the case of rock and roll
stars, tour itineraries. 

Judging by the lengths to which somefans go to cir
cumvent the official fan mail reply firms, "people on t_be‘I"

receiving end of such material must suspecitg-,somethi"rii'_':i;; 

In Hollywood, for example, there is a latg§__,upd
ground network of autograph hounds who always?-‘see 

to know when movie stars are going to be around. Even»‘.:;_.._..

something as obscure as a meeting of the actors‘ unipr},
the Screen Actors Guild, finds a flock of fans circling {Eta
doors. -

For the less ambitious, there are always movie—star
maps, sold from the trunks of ancient cars parked on
side streets throughout the Hollywood and Beverly Hills
areas. No matter that the stars listed have probably
moved three times since the map was printed.

Movie studios,TV stations and record compaines are
constantly deluged with fan mail, and everybody from
local newscasters to studio guards are approached by
fans for those elusive home phone numbers and ad-
dresses, their pleas generally accompanied by a touch-
ing, life-or—death reason for needing that information.

There are also “official” fan clubs, through which you

‘can get “exclusive" photos and news about your fave

rave. In reality, these clubs can be fan mail services in
disguise, or an amateur operation run by fans them-
selves who mail out the same type of material as the
services, but with a bit more enthusiastic devotion.
Englebert Humperdinck’s worldwide fan club network,
for example, sends out periodic news letters, which
often read like the society column in a midwestestern
weekly newspaper. The news letters also include fer-

fan mail service.Although men like Small estimate that as’
little as 2% of the mail they receive is ever seen by the:

intended recipient, their services answer 100% of it,
which is only good business practice, since the services
are paid on a piece-by—piece basis. How much they are
paid is a secret of a magnitude bordering on the CIA
budget. » 0

According to one fan mail servicer, sheer volume,“

rather than indifference, is often responsible for-the lack

of personal involvement in fan mail. Many stars, espe-

cially those who've just begun to garner fame and adula-
tion, sincerely try to read and respond to their fan mail.
Their idealistic commitment doesn't last long, however,
especially when, in the case of one TV superstar, there
are 300,000 pieces of unopened mail piled up in a room
somewhere,

that most of the letters we get are negative. The stars
don’t want to see those letters, and we don’t want to
show them to them. The really sincere ones, we try to

Pure Prairie League, Rory, Los Angeles, September
27-28

Not so long ago, groups that played the
college circuit were considered,well, second-
rat_e-—-filling in their time until they could get
a Big Break in a Big City. Nobody is trying to
avoid such a Big Break, but Pure Prairie
League claim (and they should know) that
they can make as much money——sometimes
more—headlining at colleges as opening for
Kiss in Detroit, should they ever want to do
that.

But a hit single would be nice, they admit
somewhat wistfully. W'ith one of those, they
could headline in Detroit.

The group has fond anecdotes about their
sundry college experiences (they’ve been
playing colleges, countrywide and consis-
tently, since 1973):

“College kids are a lot more friendly and
together,” noted bassist Mike Reilly. “At a
regular city concert, we see 14-year-old kids
smashed out oftheir minds, but college kids
are a little more responsible. They listen.”

“College dressing rooms are the pits, and
the worst spotlight operators are at colleges,”
that from guitarist Larry Goshorn. '

Reilly-Goshorn live together when they’re
not playing colleges, in what was once rock
and roll heaven, the Laurel Canyon section of
Los Angeles. The house feels a bit like a
motel, which is "only appropriate; they’re
hardly ever there. The balcony has a magni-
ﬁcent smog-laden view, from Century City
on the right to downtown Los Angeles on the

forts for three more days and then, back to
the college. road.

For the next several weeks Pure Prairie
League will travel the New York/Pennsyl-
vania/Maryland area, playing what is bas-
ically their new album, Live.’ Takin’ the
Stage. . .but with a new member.

Tim Goshorn, younger brother to Larry,
has replaced pedal steel player john David
Call, who is laid up——indef1nitely——with a
bad back. Tim Goshorn is no stranger to PPL
fans; he wrote two tunes on the aforemen-
tioned live album, “Sun Shone Lightly” and
“All the Lonesome Cowboys.” He can sing,
play guitar, and he knows all the right rock
and roll moves. Ifthis group ever wants a sex
symbol, they might already have one.

The group, I’m told, is reluctant to pub-

licize this nice new guitarist, simply because

they’re afraid some of their fans will reject '

them without their familiar country pedal
steel sound. You wouldn’t do that, would
you?

Aside from that college dates-aren’t-big-
time myth cited earlier, Pure Prairie League
also make short shrift of another show biz
homily——that groups popular in the
provinces are met with cool receptions in Los
Angeles and New York. The implication is
that we’rejust too slick and sophisticated to
appreciate whatever you bumpkins in the
rest ofthe country appreciate.

VVell, you should have seen the Roxy
crowd. Those same jaded critics and bored
hangers on, the crazed good timers and hope-
ful trendsetters who show up for these events,

just went apeshit for PPL. Dancing in the
aisles (no mean feat when there are no aisles),
general frenzy, and even, so help me, singing

along. Favorites for sing alongs at my.

table-——“Amie” and" “Heart of Her Own.”
Encores, ofcourse.

The couple sitting next to me were paying
customers, unlike most of those present.
Speaking to the lovingly entangled couple
across the table, the girl said, “A friend of
mine used to tell me, ‘You.gotta see this
group, they’re really good.’ They used to play
up in the mountains near Denver, and I fi-
nally saw them there. I’ve loved them ever
since.”
