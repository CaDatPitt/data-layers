October, SGB member Brian Riemer
announced that ﬂre board would waive
these allocations manual rules because
there was a surplus in the allocations ﬁmd.

Some of the forbidden items the. board
approved included a boat for the crew team
and numerous computers and ethemet con-
nections for other groups. ‘

The 1998 SGB denied many funding
requests by student groups this year
because the amount spent on the forbidden
items heavily depleted the ﬁmd.

At Tuesday evening’s SGB meeting,

the ﬁnal meeting at which the SGB
addressed emergency’ requests by student
groups before the summer, the board denied
18 of 40 student organization requests for

Police say crime is down

Brett Taylor
News Asslstant

In 1993 Pitt adopted a zero-tolerance
policy on drugs and alcohol. Since then,
the numberof reported crimes has fallen
each year, and 1997 was no exception

Deputy Chief Gary Moses said the
“zero-tolerance” policy authorizes Pitt
Police to arrest anyone found drinking in
public or buying alcohol for people under
age 21.

Capt. Tim Delaney said the decline in
crime on Pitt’s campus can be attributed to
Pitt Police cracking down on smaller
crimes and crimes related to alcohol. use.
He also said that by putting oﬂicers in

highly visible locations, police act as a
deterrent to crime.

“You can’t walk down the street with
an open container anymore. You can’t mi-
nate on the street anymore,” he said, “or
you will be ci ” I -

Highly visible oﬂicers and cracking
down on petty street crimes, he said, cut

‘down on the number of people on the

streets who have no real purpose for being
there and who may commit crimes.

' Between 1994 and 1997, the total
number of reported crimes at Pitt fell from
1,577 to 1,296 offences. ‘ '

In 1995, alcohol-related crimes,

When Pitt senior Heather
McNeish went to a resume service
to have her’s evaluated, she said
the woman looked at her resume
and looked back at her as if to say,
“My God! Do you smoke crack?”

After trying hard to cut down
its size, McNeish left the service
with a resume two pages long.

“’Ihere’s no way I can have

just one page,” explained
McNeish.
In addition to being a resident

assistant on Sutherland Hall’s
eighth ﬂoor, McNeish has been a
member of more than 10 student
groups, and a teaching assistant
for two different classes, yet she
found enough time in her sched-
ule to be crowned homecoming
queen in October.

But, despite her insanely busy
schedule, McNeish doesn’t smoke
crack In fact, she is, a severe
insomniac. '

“Sometimes I get tired, but
there’s just too much stuff to do,”
said McNeish.

She spends her late nights
thinking about all the things she
has to get done the next day.

Except when she is tracking

down the smell of feces in her

hall.

One night last year,
McNeish’s ’ residents played a
practical joke on her by putting a
pile of feces in front of her door.
McNeish said they probably
wanted her to step in it, though
they didn’t count on her insomnia
to let her in on the joke.

She walked around her room
snifﬁng and kept saying to herself
“What is that smell?”

McNeish ﬁnally looked out-
side her door and was greeted by
the heap of smelly excrement.

She burst out laughing, call-
ing her suitemates to come and
check it out.

“I found it so amusing that
people had so much-time on their
hands,” said McNeish.

Though McNeish said she
knows the prank was intended to
be malicious, it didn’t bother her.
It is all part of her ongoing job as
a senior resident assistant.

“You’re never not an RA,”
said McNeish.

Though her residents may
have extra time, McNeish hardly
ever has extra time on her hands.

Between her resident assis-
tant job in Sutherland Hall —
which she says is more than a full-
time position — and her extracur-
ricular activities, McNeish’s
schedule is full from morning to
night.

Currently, she sits on the

L.

Judicial Board. She joined
because, as an RA, she has to
attend many cases, so she decided
to become part of the board.

McNeish is also a coordinator
of the Hand—in—Hand festival in

says, these are all normal duties of

Thanks to those who ﬁght for inmates‘ rights
(rather than for rights of innocent victims), prison
inmates now enjoy far too many rights and privi-
leges. . t

The entire idea of prison is punishment. If
someone breaks the law, depending on the severity
of the crime, he is often sent to jail as punishment.
Jail should not be easy; it should be an unpleasant
experience.

As law-abiding citizens, we enjoy a number of
rights. Ir1 committing a crime, a person breaks the
agreements of society and therefore forfeits his
rights. Now, I‘rn not saying that inmates should be
tortmedoranythinglikethat,Ijustthinkthatif
inmates have a relatively easy time in prison, they
will be more likely to commit another crime,

Spending shouldn ’t be
sole activity of SGB

Last year's Student Government Board called itself "the best
SGB Pitt has ever had." It even warned this year's board it would
never be as good as last year's.

Maybe the last board wasn't consciously trying to make
things difﬁcult for the new one, but it ended up spending all the
money that was left in the allocations fund on frivolities. This
year's board has nothing left until the next ﬁscal year rolls around
in July.

Tuesday night, the student government had to reject $46,000
in allocations requests because last year's board spent $70,000 in
November and December, giving out items to student groups —
things like computers and, believe it or ‘not, a boat! —— which are
supposed to be turned down, according to official policies.

This problem seems to stem from the last board's lack of

understanding of the allocations process and that the fund oper- V

ates on a ﬁscal-year cycle. It must have thought the fund would
be replenished with the start of a new semester.

Sadly, for all those who watched their requests for field trips,
equipment and the like get turned down Tuesday night, the old
SGB was wrong. _

But there's a much deeper moral herejfor the new board to
learn, which the old one never seemed to pick up on: A good stu-
dent government doesn't make a few people happy by giving
them expensive computers, while others lose out on more rea-
sonable requests. Spending money just because it's there isn't in
the best interest of the students.

Anybody can spend money. You could just throw a bunch of
gargoyles on the Cathedral if you wanted to use up the alloca-
tions fund.

It is acting responsibly, and fairly, in the best interests of the
students, that will distinguish an SGB.

Most importantly, SGB should concentrate on being what we
really need: elected representatives who will make sure student
interests and concerns are taken to the people who run this
University and will see to it that our concerns are acted on.

Students need real changes," like getting faculty teaching
evaluations put online, a lot more than we need stupid "Pitt
Proud" T-shirts printed at the our expense.

weight lifting facilities, and even a ﬁee college edu-'

cation.

Why should inmates get cable? I know many
law-abiding citizens who don't even have cable
television. And weightlifting facilities? Just think
about that one for a second Do we really want
inmates, especially murderers and_ rapists, to
become stronger, and more capable of committing
another crime and hurting people? Deﬁnitely not.

_ I could be wrong, but I always thought the idea
of prison was to punish criminals, and part of that
punishment was to lose the many rights and privi-
leges that law-abiding citizens enjoy. At the rate
things are going, prisons are soon going to be simi-
lar to vacation resorts, complete with hot tubs" and
Jacuzzis.

The most ridiculous privilege of all, by far, is
conjugal visits. Conjugal visits are unsupervised
meetings in cottages on prison grounds with an
inmate's spouse, girlfriend, etc. These visits usually
last ovemight and can last for up to three days. In
other words, prison officials allow someone to
come in and have sex with an inmate and provide
them a place to do it. It's hard to believe they allow
such visits.

conjugal visits are California, Connecticutgf .
Mississippi, New Mexico, New York and* 
Washington. Butthis is still six states too many. 9.‘;

These visits aren't just given to inmates con-.
victed of minor crimes, they also can extend in’

some cases extend to rapists, child molesters, mur-I" 

derers, and other violent offenders. Recently, the

Senate Criminal Procedures Committee felt it was 9  ..

important for such inmates of keep their conjugal

visits, even though there have been cases of murder

and rape during such visits.
Inmates are given many more rights and privr-1

leges than they deserve, especially in the case of...
conjugal visits. Prison is becoming a more and more“:

pleasant experience, and that should not be the case ’
Prison should be as unpleasant an experience as.

Well, the 1998 Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan, have certainly lived up
to their slogan: “From around the world
to ﬂower as one.” Much better, at least,
than Atlanta did two years ago where the
slogan was more like: “Whoa, was that a
pipe bomb, or are American extremists
just happy to see us?!?”

The one thing that has plagued our
beleaguered hosts this year has been,
well, being hosts. Hosting the Winter
Olympics is a lot like having your fami-
ly over for Thanksgiving dinner, only
your family happens to be 1.2 million
people big and decides to stay for 16
days rather than one excruciatingly long
evening. .

And to top it all off, the Japanese
were responsible for constructing an
entire Olympic competitive venue to
accommodate sports such as downhill‘
skiing, bobsledding and hockey. These
sorts of venues are as commonplace to
them as, let’s say, a hydroelectric gener-
ator is to the average collegiate apart-
ment.

As a result, our gracious hosts have
spent several billion dollars (I am not
kidding) to construct and decorate stadi-
ums and arenas that will go largely
unused after the close of the events’ this
weekend. Already, they face a $214 mil-
lion cost overrun on this year’s event. All
this for an event that is actually having a
hard time beating the late-night ratings

Supporting Local
29 a worthy cause

In his Feb. 16 article in The Pitt
News, Paul Clark asserted that mainte-
nance workers are low—skil1ed and, there-
fore, do not deserve raises, unlike the
chancellor, who deserves every penny he
gets.

So Clark is an elitist and a total reac-
tionary, and has no idea what he's talking
about, but we all knew that already. (At
our debate with him on homophobia and
gay rights, Clark maintained that the
average gay male has 500 sexual partners
in his lifetime.) -

He says, "the same students wh
bemoan the high costs of college  para-
doxically, turn around and advocate
higher salaries without realizing this sim-
ple correlation." ,

Unlike Clark, we understand the cor-
relation — the high cost of college has
nothing to do with the measly wages paid
to people who actually do the work who
make a university run, and everything to
do with the bloated salaries and corporate
bottom—line priorities of administrators.

Anyone who has been active in
building support for the maintenance
workers knows that, although it's hard to

 

  

W

get people mobilized, most think the
University is being extremely unfair.

Attitudes like Clark's, and Pitt's abu-
sive treatment of workers, can only be
challenged when passive suppo1te‘rs_ of
the maintenance workers, and the work-
ers themselves, force Pitt to listen. A

Rutgers women get
revenge, 70-56

Shannon Heim

Staff Wrlter

On Jan. 6, the Pitt women’s
basketball team pulled a sur-
prising upset over the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights, winning the
Big East matchup, 66-56.

The Lady Panthers went in
to last night’s game against
Rutgers hoping to maintain
their dominance over the
Knights.

The ﬁnal score was 70-56,
but Pitt lost the reunn battle —
its‘ last away game of the sea-
son ,

In January, Gina
Montesano_ and Alecia Balich
led the Panthers in a shooting
exhibition — Montesano
scored 16, while Balich led the

on three-pointers.

In the ﬁrst half of last
night’s contest, the Lady

Panthers combined for a ﬁeld-
goal shooting percentage of
only .364, and just .286 in
three—point attempts. At half-
time, Pitt had been held to 24
points and trailed Rutgers by
nine.

The second half saw con-
siderable irnprovement by Pitt
as the team increased its shoot-
ing percentage to .400.

Unfortunately for Pitt,
Rutgers kept up, outscoring the
Panthers by ﬁve points in a
close second half to win the
contest by 14.

Pitt’s leading scorer for the
night was center Nickeia
Morris, who totaled 12 points
while adding seven boards, a
block and an assist. Trailing
Morris by only one point was
Montesano, who contributed 11
points and six rebounds.

Rutgers was paced by

The 1997-98 Panther men’s

page feature on the key contributors
to this year’s team. The second page
has two small paragraphs about

sophomore Jarrett Lockhart. One‘

major backcourt contributor this
year.”

A good guess. Not even
Lockhart himself was expecting the
guide to be right.

“I didn’t expect people to be

do much last year,” said Lockhart,
who averaged 2.7 points per game

_ It wouldn’t be far—fetched to say that
Pete Gonzalez’s life rivals a fairy tale
like Cinderella.

In this real-life tale, a tale Pitt stu-
dents have seen ﬁrstliand, Gonzalez
went from the proverbial shoeless peas-
ant to a prince. '

All with the wave of a Walt Harris
wand.

This Cinderella season, Pete
Gonzalez led the Panthers to their ﬁrst
bowl game in nine years and broke the
Big East mark for touchdown passes
with 30.

“Pete is a very vocal leader. He
demanded respect and he got it. He led
by directing on and off the ﬁeld. He
stiived to get better,” Pitt Offensive
Coordinator Steve Mooshagian said.

It wasn’t always a magical time for
Pete Gonzalez, and it sure didn’t start
out that way. He had some rough times
battling the streets, drugs and poverty of
Miami, where he grew up.

“I had a pretty tough childhood. My
parents came from other countries,” the
quarterback said simply. _

Gonzalez’s mother, Vilma, was born
in Honduras, and his late father, Jose,
was born in Cuba. Like most parents,
they came to the United States looking
for a better life and with hopes of pro-
viding for their

children.
Much like Cinderella, good times
were hard to come by.

‘There were times when my parents
didn’t eat so that my sister Sandra and I
could eat,” said Gonzalez.

“We moved to Miami after I turned
nine for a better ﬁnancial situation. It

' was real tough at ﬁrst because I was a

Hispanic kid who didn’t really speak
much English.”

Pete didn’t even get to play sports
much when he was younger. Instead, he
helped his family put food on the table.

He enjoyed outdoors pursuits,
which were also a love of his father.

“My dad was my best friend. I loved
to go hunting and ﬁshing with my
father,” he said.

Once Gonzalez reached junior high
school, things seemed to get a little bet-
ter. He picked up baseball and found that
he was a pretty good competitor — good
enough to play with Seattle Mariners’
superstar Alex Rodriguez.

He was on the ﬁfth-ranked high
school team in Florida, a state known for
high-quality baseball. He also played
with Rodriguez on the AAU national
team, which won a national title.

Gonzalez said that this was some
pretty good company and some much-
needed inﬂuence in the right direction.

But despite his success in both base-

ball and volleyball, his heart was with ‘

football.

The Deep South All-American quar-
terback weighed his options for playing
football in college. He felt that if he
attended Miami, his grades would suffer
from being so close to his fiiends.

“It’s a career move choosing Pitt.
Coming up here to this weather
was tough,” he joked.

But there were other
problems.
“It was real
tough to adjust to
Pittsburgh. The most dif-
ﬁcult was the language. Not
many people speak Spanish
around here,” he said.

Little did the charismat-
ic Hispanic boy from
Miami know that he
would see almost no
action in the next _ four
years under then-Head
Coach Johnny Majors. To
make things worse, he got
one short-lived oppor-
tunity to start and
didn’t make the
most of it.

The quarter-

back wondered

when, or if, his time would ever come.

“When I got yanked during the
Temple game a couple of years ago
[Homecoming 1996], I thought that was
it,” he said.

“I thought I would never play
again,” >

Then came the shakeups. Majors
was ﬁred. Athletics Director Oval
Jaynes was replaced by Steve
Pederson.

Walt Harris was named
head coach of the Panther
football team. And in an
early action that

said.

“The team was under my leadership,
and I wasn’t going to let us be a
mediocre team. Whatever it took,” he
said.

The rest is history. Gonzalez led the

practice. If you didn’t make the giade,,you
didn’t play. Lockhart had a B average, but
he learned something during his freshman
year that every hooper dreads: He was
done growing.  -

“I thought I was going to be 6-8,” said
Lockhart, who was a 6-foot-3 center in the
seventh grade. “I ﬁgured if I don’t grow
anymore, I’ve got to be able to do some-
thing else.” .

So Lockhart took his newly developed
jump shot to the prestigious New York City
Catholic League (which produced NBAers
Kenny Anderson and Jamal Mashbum and
and Pitt’s Jerry McCullough and Orlando
Antigua). V

‘The Catholic League is where most
of the good players [from New York City]
play,” said Lockhart, who faced former
Sports Illustrated coverboy and current St.
J ohn’s player Felipe Lopez, Arkansas’

Kareem Reid,   Beach State’s
Rameal Lloyd in high school.
“It was a lot of competition,” Lockhart

. said, but he was up to the challenge. He led

Mount St lVIichael’s to the Class-B. state
championship his junior year, wmmn' ' g the
state’s most valuable player award, and led
his team to the city championship his
senior year, winning the city MVP whﬂe
leading the Catholic League in scoring by
averaging 25 points a game.

This perfonnance eamed Lockhart
top—l00—prospect status from many recruit-
ing services after his senior year, and he
was a McDonald’s All-American nominee.
He visited Hawaii, Villanova and, of
course, Pitt (he also visited Providence and
Florida St. his junior year). =

Lockhart narrowed his choices to Pitt
and Villanova.

“I was supposed to visitV1llanova one

weekend, but [Villanova Head Coach]
Steve Lappas wanted me to come the next
weekend,” said Lockhart. ‘That just made
my choice easier.”  - ,

Lockhart felt right at home’ at Pitt.

“It reminded me of New York, and it
wasn’t too far away. My family wanted me
to get out of the city and go somewhere dif-
ferent.”

“I had to get out of the city,” said
Lockhart “There’s too many distractions.”

The lack of distractions at Pitt is prob-
ably responsible for Lockhart’s blossom-
ing into a more polished student and ath-
lete.

“He’s focused,” Taylor reiterated.
“He’s doing well, and he can be a whole lot
better. He knows that”

Who knows? Maybe Lockhart will
have three paragraphs in next year’s media
guide.

”Mo-Mo" puts inexperience aside to p ay the point for Panthers

Kevin Ltlley

Sports Edltor

She’s been cmcial to the sea-
son’s two biggest wins for the
Lady Panthers.

She’s been written about in
the Los Angeles Times.

She’s been described as Pitt’s
only true point guard in years.

And she’s been “in a tizzy.”

Freshman Monique Toney’s
been many things, but that last
tizzy —- a term Head Coach Kirk
Bnice used to describe his 5-foot-
5 point guard’s play against
Syracuse last week — may
describe her best.

She is active to a fault, often
keeping control of the ball longer
than her coach or her teammates
would want. Taking over recently
for an injured LaTonya Blanton,
Toney has nearly matched her pre-
decessor’s assist total in fewer
minutes.

Of course, her tmnovers are
already outpacing Blanton’s by
over 30, scoring 90 to Blanton’s
55. That’s the bad part of the tizzy,
according to Bruce.

“Mo-Mo [Toney’s nickname]
might be taking some more
chances with her passes than
LaTonya does,” Bruce said

  

,7».

The coaching stalf takes time
in nearly every  to instruct
Toney on the ﬁner points of ball
distribution — how and when to
make passes inside to the team’s
dominating frontcourt players,
Nickeia Morris, Kenosha
Chastang and Fanah Woods.

The trio underneath has pro-
duced most of Pitt’s offensive
ntunbers this season. But on occa-
sion, they are ignored by the ﬁesh-
man point guard

According to Bruce, this isn’t
always a bad thing.

“Monique is smart enough to
know that there are times she

  

oneyigrabbed three steals in last night's game versus Rutgers.

needs to have control of the ball,”
Bruce said. “There have been
times this year when Mo-Mo has

, broken the press by herself.”

Breaking the press has been
Toney’s strong point since her
days at Valley Christian High
School in Yorba Linda, Calif. As a
senior she averaged 13 points, ﬁve
steals and ﬁve assists. per game,
good enough to get her on the LA
Times’ East/South Coast All-Star
team.

Her grades weren’t bad, either
— the Times also ranked Toney as
an all-area Scholar Athlete. She
earned a membership in the

 

National Honors Society in high
school as well.

“Academics is something that
is very important in my house-
hold,” Toney said. “They pushed
me, my parents did.”

Bruce is well aware of his

point guard’s mental and athletic
abilities. He is impressed with both
and insists that Toney’s ability to
pick up schemes and formations
quickly has been a key part of her
recent increase in playing time.

“Monique’s got a good head
on her shoulders,” he said “She
listens. That’s going to allow her to
get better quicker.”

She has been getting better.
Toney has led the team in scoring
three times this year, two of which
have come in the past ﬁve games.
While she did not lead the squad in
points against Syracuse (she ﬁn-
ished second with 12), her three

assists and four rebounds proved‘

crucial to Pitt’s 58-49 upset win.
Hence, the tizzy. But it wasn’t

the only tizzy.
In the Panthers’ other Big East

win this season, a 10-point deci-

sion over current Big East Seven
division leader Rutgers, Toney
registered her career high in assists
with seven and also contributed six
points to the effort. Against Notre

Dame this past weekend Toney
dominated the court, ﬁnishing sec-
ond in assists and ﬁrst in points for
the Panthers despite a 15-point loss
to the Irish.

“I felt like I played like more
than a freshman,” Toney said
about her play versus Rutgers. “I
felt like I was a leader.”

VV1th Blanton shelved for at
least one more game, Toney will
be given even more time to show-
case her talents. While her coach
could not foresee the injury to
Blanton and the playing time the
freshman would receive, he did
say that he expected Toney to be
able to step in right away.

“We knew that shehad the

ability to play as a freshmar1,” V.
Bruce said, when asked why the

Panthers went after the Califomi
product “And she lmew if she did-

n’t start, she’d play a lot anyway.” in

She has played a lot She has
matured, according to , both the
words of her coaclr . ‘and, says
Toney, the play of her‘ older team-
“ the court, they don’t see
me as being younger,” Toney said
“That’s basically , my family. If
there’s not a mutual respect there,
then you’re basically not going to
