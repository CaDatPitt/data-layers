Campus Plebiscite
Ends But Sophomore
Voter Wonders On

By GEORGE HYDE

The crack of the bat resound- 1

ed from Panther Hollow to
Alumni ‘Hill Friday, but it
wasn’t heard over the drone of
campaigner’s pep talks and the
click of voting machines. V

If you expect this to be an ex-
planation of Friday’s ﬁasco or so-

called “plebiscite,” read no furth-

er. I think it only fair to warn
you that last year when I was a
freshman, I understood nothing
about the elections. This year I
am a sophomore, and I understand
less.

Rumblings of what was to come
were heard a few weeks ago when
friends, and even strangers, rushed
up, buttonholed me, and requested
my signature on petitions for
nomination to the various offices.
That was only the beginning.

War Declared

Last Wednesday the boys went
to work in earnest. As I was get-
ting off the street car on the morn-
ing of my return from Easter va-
cation, Jack I-Ioeveler thrust a blue
sheet in my hand on which was
blazoned in alarming manner
“War Is Declared.”

Blue cards, yellow slates, orange
tickets, and red platforms. I
didn’t miss one. ,A few of the
campaigners had the temerity to
pass, out white mimeographed ad-
Evidently..their cam-
paign treasury couldn’t stand the
drain of a printer’s bill. The cli-
max to all this came with Senator
Ziskind’s monumental “I accuse”
I . written a la Zola.‘ ,

> Friday afternoon» I entered Me-
morial Hall with -an independent
sucker in my mouth and promises
to give my vote to both tickets on
my lips. A supposedly “non-par-
tisan” election official gave me one
more propaganda card and told me
the right way to vote.

Sound Vote

I am glad we voted in the Amer-

ican manner—-in secret. I split my-

vote in more ways than one. I
voted for my friends, (as every
one else did), and for a few peo-
ple whose names I liked the sound
of. This latter method political
scientists will tell you is very un-
intelligent, but once I picked a
winning horse that way.

Of course, if we voted under the
German system it would be much
simpler. I can understand why
the Germans don’t object when
Hitler gives them a ballot already
marked ‘Ja.’

At this writing I don’t know the
outcome, but evidently Senator
Gerald N. Ziskind looked into
Rackoff’s crystal, because on Fri-
day afternoon while the battle of
votes was still being fougit, he de-
clared, “Fraternity misrule has
triumphed. May God save us!”

Since the fraternities came out
on top, the Greeks still have a
word for it—“victory.” The In-
dependents also have a few words
for it, and they are probably “We
wuz robbed!”

Navy Officer
Will interview

Men Thursday

The Placement Bureau for Men,
in cooperation with the department
of mechanical engineering, an-
nounces that interviews for seniors
interested in the U. S. Navy’s Avi-
ation Flight Training course will
be held in 208 Cathedral Thursday
morning at 10:30 o’clock.

Seniors deﬁnitely interested in
this course, and who possess the
necessary physical and education-
al qualiﬁcations, are requested to
meet with Lt. B. T. Talbott, of the
U. S. Navy, at the above named
place and time.

A two-reel picture on aviation
cadet training entitled “Navy
Wings of Gold” will be shown.

Lt. Talbott says, “The four-year
course of active duty in the Navy
is literally a post-graduate course
in aviation. It offers training in-
valuable to those who intend to
pursue aviation as a career or
those who intend to apply the edu-
cational advantages to other civil
pursuits.”

Foster Curator

Stephen Foster Memorial will
be open to the public tomorrow
evening, from 7:39 to 10:30
o’clock, Fletcher Hodges, Jr.,

class to Chesapeake Biological‘
Laboratory at Solomon’s Island on ;

-Association Assembly, and swept all offices in College Asso-

ciation and Men’s Council.

Only three candidates of the 30
running for SFA on the five Coa-
lition slates met defeat, and Coal-
ition candidates for College As-
sociation and Men’s Council piled
up huge majorities as an unpre-
cedented total of 1905 voters reg-
istered their choices on the 14
County—loaned voting machines in
Memorial Hall.

LOPSIDED RESULTS

Coalition leaders believed that
their Independent—Dental-Frater-
nity combination formed a prac-
tically unbeatable group of five
slates to fill the 30 SFA seats.

Th-ey were right. Only three of
the 12 Independent-Independent
candidates managed to cut into
the victorious Coalition lineup.
Among the Independent casual-
ties was Brooks Sipes, leader of
the insurgent group.

Last year’s record of 1723 vot-
ers was expected to stand this
year, because classes are no long-
er being held in Alumni Hall, and
the weather forecast was unfav-
orable. But the weather was sat-
isfactory, and the Coalition ma-
chine worked efficiently in bring-
ing out voters, as the lopsided re-
sults testify.

KAIRYS LEADS AGAIN
, Vote. totals of the leading can-
didates for SFA were high, Mer-
cedes Shiring topping the junior
w0man’s list with 466 votes, ex-
actly 100 more than the record
tally made last year by Al Kair-..
ys. Miss Shiring received 153.‘
more votes than her" nearest jun-.
ior competitor.  ,

Kairys again topped- the list in:
his division, leading the senior
men with 364 votes. He was pres-
sed closely by Buddy Mayer, who
scored a total of 363. Other lead-
ers_ were Mary Louise McClain‘,
senior woman, with 379; Patrick
Cusick, junior man, with 385; and
Ray Dimit, junior man, with 365.

INDEPENDENT WINNERS

Only members of the Indepen_
filent party Wh0 Were successful
in breaking the stranglehold of
the Coalition were Jack Hoeveler,
who placed third in the junior
men’s list, with 325 votes; Mary
Gregg, Who placed fourth in the
junior women’s list, with 172
votes; and Gertrude Broido, jun-
ior woman, who captured fifth
place with 165 votes, to beat out
Helen Fritchman, Coalition can-
didate, by a margin of one vote.

In the race for College Associa-
tion ‘oifices, the four Coalition
candidates scored easy victories.
Ray Light, running for president,
scored 614 votes, while his near-
est competitor, Tom Smith, Inde-
pendent candidate, accounted for
only 173 votes. Other coalition
winners in the CA race were Don-
ald Cefaretti, vice-president;
Jeanne Culver, secretary; and
Helen Kessler, treasurer.

FRATERNITIES DOMINATE

Eight Men’s Council candidates
of the Coalition shared in the
smashing victory of their group,
running far ahead of the Inde-
pendent aspirants to Council.

Victory of the eight Coalition
candidates, all fraternity men,
and the automatic election of two
others, who were unopposed,
makes Men’s Council a miniature
Interfrateinity Council, with each
of the 13 seats being filled by a
fraternity man. The three mem-
bers chosen by this year’s seniors
at an internal election early this
month are also fraternity men.

If the Coalition candidates
elected to SFA Assembly main-
tain a united front, they will be
able to elect the president and

Curriculum
Increased
ForSummer

Session Includes
Retailing Course,
Classics Institute

The University summer session
curriculum will be increased this
year to include new courses for
teachers in retail training and a
institute for Latin teachers, ac-
cording to Frank W. Shockley, di-
rector of the summer session.

RETAIL TRAINING

Provisions of the George-Deen
Act for the teaching of retail
training and allied subjects in
high schools have created a de-
mand for teachers trained in these
subjects. The facilities of the
University retail training division,
one of the six in the United
States, will be made available for
the new courses, Bishop Brown,
head of the division announces.

The course, for a period of six
weeks, will be conducted in two
three-week units. It will include
methods of teaching retailing in
the high schools, and is designed
for teachers of home economics,
art, industrial studies, and com-
mercial subjects. Textiles, dis-
play, selling, and management
will also be included in the
course. '

LATIN INSTITUTE

Classroom instruction will be
supplemented by observation in
Pittsburgh department stores

which cooperates with the Uni-
versity in maintaining the Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training.

All students enrolled in classics
courses during the regular session,
July 6 through August 12, will be
admitted to membership in the
Atlantic States Institute for Latin
Teachers which will hold sessions
on campus this summer.

Wednesday with the ideal spring
fever tonic.

Featuring a story “A Penny for
Your Thoughts,” Mary Lou Per-
ring, C40, and Frank Miller, C41,

sic which has been sold for 25

be “Ectoplasmic Missive” by Frank
Miller, C41; in which Joe Butch,
C39, deceased, gives the lowdown
on life in the hereafter. Butch
isn’t sure where he is, but it’s won-
derful.

Tom Smith, C39, editor in dis-
cussing the matter said “lt’ll be
out Wednesday, if the covers come
in from New York. That’s all
we’re waiting for.”

While we are speaking to
freshmen, did you get all the in-
formation on the Public Speak-
ing Unit’s fun of Wednesday
last? After dining together ﬁrst
of ‘all, the gals trouped down to
station WCAE to sit in on one
of the broadcasts. As privileged
characters, they were allowed to
remain "in the studio instead of
in the observation booth.

Not being satisﬁed with that,
their curiosity led them next to
explore the mysteries of the
Post-Gazette plant, where they
enjoyed more than anything

Short-Stop Hagan Gets
Behind Baseball

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

 

Mental notes from aransacked cerebellum . . . No one is
more het up about the campus baseball reincarnation than ath-
letic commissar Jimmy Hagan, who is throwing the full strength
of’ the athletic department behind what promises to be the
biggest intramural sheba.ng in many springs . . . and it was more
than opening day at Forbes Field the other , day that sent
Hagan’s baseball blood up . . . it turns out that the diamond
sport was the big moment in Hagan ’s adolescence . . . and he
averaged nine innings of baseball every day for several summers dur-
ing his high school days . . . as one of the snappiest short-stops on
the Western Pennsylvania sandlots he was offered a try-out with the
Louisville outﬁt in the American Association . . .

Being that way about the game it was very much of a heartbreak
when he picked up a paper in Camp Windber (remember?) where he
was fall—drilling with the Panther footballers in his freshman year
and found out that Pitt had dismissed baseball from the varsity cur-
riculum . . . now, with one decade intervening since his graduation
‘he is‘ goingto have the chance to hit-and-run for the Blue and Gold
. . . it is rumored that he will be covering the distance between sec-
-ond and third base and DiMaggioing ’em out for the faculty team that
is being entered in the intramural play.

Just about the time we were envisioning a great year for the
maturing fairwaymen, word sifted in from some of the golf opponents’
headquarters to break up any wishful thinking . . . Pennsylvania has
a six man team of low-seventy shooters and they have been spending
the early spring touring the southland . . . so by the time they meet
the Panthers, the date is May 14, they will have the beneﬁt of a month

of match-play over the still unloosened Pitt team . . .

Conference Has Good Teams

Georgetown, another one of the conference adversaries, had its
number one and number two men shooting low among the leaders in
the recent Mason—Dixon tournament . . . which was not a collegiate
affair L . . but one for the masters . . . Princeton is alwaystops and
Cornell is no slouch . . . and from the other bracket of the Eastern
Collegiate Conference Whitey Fuller writes to the eﬁect “Dartmouth
should add another cup to the hockey, basketballand fencing trophies
if the golf team coached by Tommy Kenne and led by Dick Heneage
comes through as expected . r. . Dick says that the mashie swingers
have had more chance to practice before goinginto the season cam-
paign than they have had for years” . . . Will the birdies, sing, Bar-
rett?

If for nothing else than tradition’s sake, Carl Olson’s track team
will have to bring back at least one of the handsome plaques and
Watches that go with the winning of a championship in the Penn Re-
lay games . . . the custom was formally inducted during the Olson
regime two years ago when trackmates and roommates Walt Good
andiGene Taano brought back two prizes between them . . Good
stretched himself out for the hop, step, and jump championship while
Taano heaved the javelin further than any one else in Franklin Field

that day .

S’ 9'5 =l= * =3 #4

Hopes In‘Vars’ity Mile

Last year the championship idea was reinforced as the freshman
relay team ran away with the mile title . . . wait at the tape that
signiﬁes the end of the varsity mile if you’re interested in Pitt’s cham-
pionship potentialities this season . . . the incumbent mile relayers
are in order Frank Ohl, Al McKee, Al Ferrara, and Johnny Woodruff

. the three sophomores know what it feels like to win in these
games . . being that they were three-fourths of the yearling com-
bination last year . . and the feeling of tape breaking across his
breast is not exactly unfamiliar to O1’ Johnny . . . during the indoor
season this quartet established itself as the ‘best in the country by
winning all the important meets and beating all of the allegedly-best
teams . . . however, "although it wasn’t beaten, it_ didn’t have the best
time and there is suspicion that the NYU team that Jim Herbert
anchors will be more than healthy competition . . .

According to one New Yawk pundit the reason that ‘DiMaggio
delayed tossing his autograph to Jake Ruppert was because the DiMag
is rather superstitious . . . and since he hadn’t been able to start the
season on time since his advent into the big time . . . bad ﬁnger and
a pair of tonsils interfering . . he feared the consequences of a
prompt beginning this season . . at $165 a day, it was a rather ex-
pensive superstition . . .

on the Trees practice ground when
next year’s varsity played the let-

annual spring siesta. _
It was the same old story when
it came to the score, which being
21-O, was decisive enough, and
when the color on the sidelines
was observed. But, the condition,
not the proven reputation, of the,

around by the varsity, but when

ﬁciently, and they weren’t speak-
ing that way from sheer modesty.

But things weren’t altogether
bleak. There were a great many
very happy things to think about.
One of them was that the old
spring custom of uncovering a
seemingly great sophomore half-
back was not overlooked. Just as
Goldberg and Cassiano have
bloomed in the last two springs,
so did last Saturday’s sun bring
out young Bob Thurbon. 

THURBON STARS

Cassiano wasn’t feeling chip-
per and the scampering sophomore
got his chance. He teamed with
crooning Curly Stebbins to make
it another great halfback com-
bination. In actual ﬁgures he
scored two touchdowns. Emil
Naric, looking like a ve-ry good
replacement for Curly Stebbins,
who looked very smooth himself,
scored the other six pointer in
addition to showing that halfback
was one position well fortified.

Marshall Goldberg at fullback
indicated something else very
pleasant. That he is still a great
back, and also that this year the
back field won’t have worry about
having its interference running
fast enough in front of it. Big-
gie will be there.

Bill Daddio, Al Lezouski, and
Steve Petro are still their old po-

Although the Pittsburgh Pir-
ates slugged out before the

home folks in the lot across the
street-car tracks last Friday,

that openingiday fever was still.

very evident on the campus today.

The reason, of course, was the
student anticipation of the bulg-
ing baseball intramural program,
whose ﬁrst practice sessions be-
gin today and continue on
throughout the week as various
teams ready for the league’s be-
ginning, next Monday, May 2.

ENTRIES DUE

Entry blanks, obtainable in
Frank Carver’s office on the 27t_h
floor of the Cathedral and return-
able by a tentative 4 o’clock dead-
line today in the same place, have
been coming in at a pace that
leaves little doubt as to the cam-
pus interest in the new baseball
set-up.

At a meeting of the policy-de-
termining committee in the Uni-
versity Club Friday afternoon the
rules governing play was formu-
lated. Eligibility restrictions were
negotiated and a proposed six in-
ning game was given serious con-
sideration. , _ é ,  ,

PRACTICE ASESSIQNS, ’

But of immediate interest was
the announcement that practice
was to be theiorder of the week
for the next ﬁve days. The new-
ly-fashioned baseball diamond in
the Stadium has been shaped in-
to playable conditionalready and
has been made available to every
Ar-
rangements to secure drill time
are abundant and it is expected
that a great majority of the league
players will take advantage of the
practice provisions.

Announced last week and to be
held as scheduled is the meeting
of all team managers or represent-
atives in the athletic office at 4
o’clock this afternoon at which
time an acquainten-ce with the
rules and regulations will be in
order. A

Announcements c o n c e r n in g
equipment were also made at Fri-
day’s committee meeting. The uni-
versity has offered to make quite
an abundant contribution. In ad-
dition to the ﬁeld and the Sta-
dium dressing room as the phys-
ical environment, the athletic of-
{ice is providing the baseballs,
bats, a ﬁrst baseman’s mitt, and all
of the backstopping equipment,
i. e. a catcher’s mask, glove, chest
and shin protectors.

TOWELS FOR PLAYERS,

For the further convenience of
the players, athletic director James
Hagan also stated that the play-
ers would be given personal lock-
ers if they so desired and that
towels would be supplied by his
department to the participants for
shower use after each game. The
manner in which he indicated the
intramural players would be
treated would be the same as any
other University athletic team.

the physical education department
hasshaped up four teams at this
writing. Any student, anxious to
play, who hasn’t been approached
as yet is urged to contact either
the dean of his school or the

ternity council is entering the play.

Johnny Bazyk won the shot put,
a familiar accomplishment for
him and Clifton won the pole

The 220-yard dash seemed to
have gained a Pitt copyright. Cap-
tain Dick Mason was ﬁrst, Ferrar-

third. The same may be said
about the two mile run as Stern-
er, Cas Kopec, and Zamborsky
finished in that order.

Pete Bennett, the chesty blonde,
kept on his straight and narrow
ways to grab the high jump. Pitt
remained exclusive in the mile
run as Woodruﬁ got his pacing

On The Elections:
' By S. F. Ayers

VVaiting in gloomy Memorial Hall Friday
evening for the Election Board to ﬁnish tally-
ing the ﬁgures from the 14 vote machines was
an expectant group which included Coalition
bosses Buddy Mayer and John Downie, Inde-
pendent leader Brooks Sipes, candidates Ed

Springer, Bernie Cashdollar, and Sam Whiteman, 5

Norma (Peep) Douglas (“just waiting for my sis-
ter”), Jane Epping (“want to know how the green
slate came out”),-and Herb Rackoﬁ (“how were
my predictions?”).

They all wanted to know the same thing-what
happened to the Coalition?

Said volatile Sipes to suave Mayer: ‘,‘I’ll tell you
Buddy . . . when I get in I’ll let you have the ‘vice-
presidency. You ‘ '
are a nice guy.
See that hand-
some Downie
over there? l’ll
let him be chair-
man of the ,
cheering block.  PW
That’s a good job ‘- P ' '*o'~3~?5E'?3’
for him.” Beery Friday Night

Then Al Barr, chairman of thevElections Board,
opened the door of the counting room to announce
the results. “Well, it’s all over—27 out of 30.”

Chirped jubilant Mayer: .-“It was a tough ﬁght,
Mom, but I won. This is the happiest day Of my
life.” ,

Monotoned dead-pan Downie: “I’m happy that
the whole Coalition went through with the power
it did.” ’ ' '

Squawked irate Sipes, upon hearing that he
was defeated by four votes: “We’ve been rook-
ed. Fraternities dominate the election board.
We demand a recount.” _ ‘

(Editor’s note: This statement from Sipes must
have a slightly beery tinge to it, for he later re-
pudiated it. See below.)

Retortcd ﬁrm SFA President Ernie Rose: “You
won’t get a recount. Do you think we would
have let Helen Fritchman lose by one vote if we’d
have known about this’ ahead‘ of. time, unless it
was a straight election?”

Rejoiced prognosticator Rackoﬁ: “See how my
choices came out? I pickedthe leader in every divi-
sion. It’s a darn’ good thing._I’m an actuarial stu-
dent.” ’ ’

   

has 5done the best danged job of '.Dl'6€1iCting' 8160--
tions that. wc’ve ever heard ‘ of._. He missed only
fourlbut of 30'positions, and two of the four were
alternates. You bet he’s good!) , «
Complained weary Barr: “I’m damn tired. Things
turned out a little better than I expected, though. I
thought we’d lose ﬁve or six seats out of the 30.”
Queried lovely Miss Epping: “Why should I make
a statement? I’m not a political boss. You can tell
what the others think of the election. Anyway, the

green slate came through.”
=1: :3 =l=

(Editcr’s note: We’re sure Sipes’ statement on
Friday night was a little beery. On Saturday morn-
ing, we received another pronunciamento from the
Independent boss).

Announced Sipes on the morning after the
election: “Congratulations to the fraternity coal-
ition on its splendid victory. Independents
have the candidates, the platform, and the lol-
lypops; the fraternities had the votes. In the
interest of good student government we are ready
to cooperate. We thank everyone _who support-
ed us and accept our defeat as the will of the
majority. I-wish to retract all previous state-
ments I have made.”

Coalition Slates Sweep
To Victory In Election

(Continued from Page One)

all six student members of the Executive Commit-
tee. . Unless some Coalition members bolt from what
is now a closely-united group to join with the three
Independents who squeezed through, there will be
no contest in the choice of Executive Committeemen
and president.

The three breaks in the ﬁve Coalition slates for
SFA were all made by narrow margins. Only
Coalition candidates to lose were Helen Fritchman,
running on a slate backed by Independents, Phi
Delta Theta, Pi Lambda Pi, and Delta Delta Delta;
other defeated Coalition candidates were Fred
Franke and Marjorie Kuhbach, running on a slate
backed by Independents, Sigma Chi, Pi Kappa Al-
pha, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Alpha Delta Pi.

-All present members of the SFA Assembly who
ran for reelection were successful. They are: Ann
Whippo, Peggy Donley, and Sally Fogle; senior wo-
men; Al Kairys, Bernard Cashdollar, Al Barry, Leo
Griffith, and Frank Widney, senior men.

Coalition bosses Ernie Rose, Les Hamburg, and Al
Barr saw their best expectations realized as the
combination of fraternities, Dents, and Independents
succeeded in rounding up droves of voters for the
ﬁve SFA slates.

Of the winning candidates, 16 represented ele-
ments of the old fraternity party, which won last
year’s election, by a margin of 16 to 14. The other
11 Coalition candidates who won represent Inde-
pendents, Dental students, and the women’s fra-
ternities which composed the Independent party of
last year.

Women Are Like That with Kay Francis and Pat
O’Brien.

I am of the school that will maintain to the bit-
ter end if necessary that Pat O’Brien ﬁts behind
a policeman’s badge. He was born to be one of
the city’s ﬁnest and it’s a sin and a shame to cast
him in any other part.

Oh once in awhile, if he must have his little
fling, he can play a ﬁreman of maybe a marine but
an advertising excutive-—well you’ve heard the
old story of not being able to make an advertising
executive with a sow’s ear or any other anatomy
short of a chorus girl’s haven’t you? No? Well that’s
too bad, really too bad, but not surprising because

there isn’t any such story.

Of course I could always make one up but that
wouldn’t help Women Are Like That the least lit-
tle bit. Not that the picture is asking for any help,
not at all. On the contrary, it’s being as nice as
possible under the circumstances, maintaining a
sort of grim resigned silence about the whole affair.
In fact the only words it will say are, “Well ‘that’s
show business for you.”

Anyway _ Women Are Like That gives us Kay
Francis as a clever impulsive little girl who runs
out on one man at the last minute and marries Pat
O’Brien. These two make a lovely couple, young,
witty, sophisticated, in love.

Well everything looks good for the ﬁrst ﬁve min-
utes and then the audience is grieved to learn that
with all its other troubles the picture contains a
rascally father-in-law. This fellow is not dumb,
however, not dumb at all. He steals 85,000 dollars
from his and Pat’s advertising ﬁrm and gets the
hell away from everything in a hurry.

He’s probably having a good time with the money
right now, while you and anybody else who may
see the picture sweats through two hours, watch-
ing Pat slave martyr like to raise the cash and pay
back the ﬁrm.

There's nothing more I’d rather do than tell you
the rest of the story. In fact, I’d consider it a
privilege and a pleasure to do so but unfortunately
it was right at that point where Pat squares his
shoulders, ﬂutters his eyelids and sighs that I rose
from my seat in the twelfth row center, took two
steps to the right, turned left, and walked out.

he sticks, to his Jewish characterizations he does a

News Poll Tests
Peace Sentiment

Following is the result of partial returns of The
Pitt News poll on the general subject of war and
peace.

 

. , First question, which dealt with collective action
‘by America with other peaceful nations by means

of economic sanctions against the “aggressor” na-
tions in order to compel aggressor nations to desist,
was answered in the aﬁirmative by a very slight
margin. ~

Second question which asked, “Do you favor mil-
itary action to restrain aggressors,” received a neg-
ative reply.

As to the ﬁfth query, “would you urge American
entrance into a hypothetical revised League of Na-
tions, with strengthened provisions for peaceful
change and revision of treaties,” the predominance
of replies was in the affirmative. .

To question number six, which said, “Should
America in the future work toward a policy of pro-
gressive disarmament in cooperation with other
powers?” the majority of replies was “yes.”

“Do you favor the Oxford pledge not to support
U. S. in any wars?” received a negative response.

The student body voted in favor of the question:
“Do you favor ﬁghting in defense at home but not
in wars abroad?” and were in opposition to: “Do
you favor ﬁghting to defend American rights
abroad?”

The above results, based on a small portion of
the returns and on only a few of the questions, do
not mean that the ﬁnal tabulations will ﬁnd the
voting unchanged. The complete poll statistics will
be published Wednesday in conjunction with the
Peace Day assembly.

Point .1 . .

 

 

Since it is, admittedly Spring, I may be pardoned for lux-
uriating in 3. little wishful thinking . . .
Somehow, I like tothink of this “peace assembly” coming

up on \Vednesday as an “anti-war strike.”

the latter in actuality

(It might have been

but you know how those things are.)

Of course, the meeting here will take place half an hour
behind the demonstration— scheduled for 11 o’clock all over
America: an appropriate gesture. And everything will be well-

managed
of the spontaneity - or general
nastiness surrounding walkouts.

But, as they say when you get
a 49-cent birthday 0 present,_ it’s
the spirit behind it that counts.
Calling the fourth hour on Wed-
“strike” is not mere
quibbling.

STRIKE VS. ASSEMBLY

A ‘strike is essentially a protest,
an emphatic compelling protest.
Assemblies are generally sopori-
ﬁce, and corny ones at that.

But more important, uniﬁed
demostrations throughout the
country at the same time, calling
out as they did last year 500,000
students, are a visible show of a
possibility. These strikes are
dress rehearsals for what might
happen if war is declared.

Of course, thousands of students

and oﬁicial, with none¢

took the occasion as a holiday.
But many knew what the day
signiﬁed, what a widespread pro-
test of "young men and women
could accomplish.
FOR ‘DEAR OLD GUAM’

If, and when, we are called up-
on to do or die for dear old
Guam, 500,000 paciﬁsts, slackers,
and traitors can have a powerful
inhibiting eﬁect on the M-day
plans of the military.

(I know this sounds visionary.
But it’s Spring. And remember
the British war office almost de-
clared war on Russia in 1925 but
changed its mind when the British
Trades Union congress threatened
to call a general strike.)

So if it’s an assembly to you on
Wednesday, it’s a strike to me-—
and the ﬁring squad take the
hindmost.

Water Transportation
Reduces Cost Of Coke

Bureau Of Business Research Explains
4 Pittsburgh Dominance In Iron, Steel Industry

(Editor’s Note:

This is a second of two articles discussing and

explaining the Pittsburgh dist1'ict’s dominance of the iron and steel
industry, based on a study by the Bureau of Business Research.)

Pittsburgh and industrial towns of its district get coke for
their pig iron-producing blast furnaces at low cost because of
cheap water transportation for coal furnished by nearby rivers.
Other cities dependent on rail transportation of cokingicoal lack

that advantage.

But iron ore must be transported, too.

And there, econ-

omists of the Bureau of Business Research of the University

have found, Pittsburgh is at 2.9

disadvantage.

It takes approximately one and
eight—tenths tons of iron ore to
produce one ton of pig iron.

To transport that amount of
ore to Pittsburgh district blast
furnaces costs approximately
$5.80. Weirton and Steubenville
producers of pig iron pay about
the same transportation of that
amount of ore, necessary to pro-
duce one ton of pig iron, about

$5.50. . ,
TRANSPORTATION COSTS
Transportation costs of that

amount of ore from Lake Super-
ior mines to Chicago are esti-
mated at $3.49.

Why this great difference? Chi-
cago is located on Lake Michigan,
not so many miles from the iron
ore mines of the Lake Superior
region. The ore is loaded on
boats, and makes its entire trip
cheaply by water.

Ore bound for Pittsburgh makes
part of its trip by cheap water
transport, but it is unloaded at
Conneaut (Ohio), Ashtabula, and
other Lake Erie ports, and travels
the rest of the way by more cost-
ly rail transport.

Transportation costs on lime-
stone, the other main blast fur-
nace material, are relatively low
-—and not widely different for
various centers -— because this
ﬁuxing element is widely dis-

Lakeside centers have the ad-
vantage of low ore transportation
costs. But inland furnace cen-
ters, especially Pittsburgh and
adjacent river towns, have the
advantage of low coal transporta-
tion costs.

AS SEIVIBLY ADVANTAGE

Where, then, does the advant-
age in assembly costs rest? Here
is what University researchers
ﬁnd: Combined transportation
costs on the coal, iron ore, and
limestone necessary to produce
one ton of pig iron are estimated
at $6.42 at Pittsburgh, and $6.31
at Weirton—Steubenville.

Thus, the researchers ﬁnd, the
balance of advantage on assem-
bly —-— or transportation — costs
rests with furnaces at Pittsburgh
and nearby river towns.

If Pittsburgh has low assembly
costs, then why did the district
decline in importance in the iron
and steel industry down to the
late 1920’s?

The answer, say economists,
lies in the earlier westward
movement of population-—-and the
consequent rise of new consum-
ing industries in the Mid-W est.
And, they add, these assembly
cost differences are small enough
that they may-—for a time at least
—be substantially oﬁ°set by other
factors, such as nearness to con-
suming markets, cheaper scrap
iron, or more efficient equipment.

DETERMINE LOCATION

But how do these assembly
cost ﬁgures for pig iron manufac-
ture affect the location of steel

furnaces and steel rolling mills?

Here is what The Pitt researchers
say: . -

“In the making of most steel
products, the location of blast-
furnace plants requires a nearby
location of steelworks and rolling
mills because efficiency demands
that most steel products, such as
rails, structural shapes, sheets,
and strip be produced by integ-
grated operations in order to
avoid heat losses between pro-
cesses and the unnecessary cost
of shipping heavy semi—ﬁnished
materials.

Even‘ though a substantial per-
centage of the total steel produced
originates from scrap, it is usu-
ally more desirable to charge
steel furnaces with both scrap
and molten pig iron. Blast fur-
nace assembly costs, therefore,
basically determine the location
not only of blast furnaces, but also
the location of the country’s ma-
jor steel furnaces and rolling
mills.”

Mexican Temperament

“VVcel you have a sect?” she offered, pointing an elbow at

As I walked into her dressing room, Lupe was crouched over
the wash basin, drooling toothpaste as she scrubbed away at her
teeth. She reached for a glass of water, swished some around in

her mouth, aimed it at the drain¢

in the sink and grabbed for the
towel.

“Now we shake hands?” She
extended a ﬁrm, brown arm in a
feminine but vigorous handshake.
“You weel excuse my back, but I
mus’ put on my makeup.” She
sat before a small, illuminated
mirror and I talked to her reflec-
tion. ',

‘POOF’ TO CRITICS

It seems that the Pittsburgh
drama critics weren’t too enthusi-
astic about “You Never Know”
and I was curiou.s to get Lupe’s re-
action.

“Poof,” she exclaimed with a
shrug of her shapely shoulders,
“They said nothing bad about me.
And anyway, I would rather be in
a show where they say, ‘Ees not so
good——ees not so hchot,’ and it run
six months, than in a show where
they say, ‘Ees marvelous—ees
grand,’ and show she close in two
days.”

Asked about ﬁery Mexican tem-
perament she flashed her eyes in-
dignantly.

‘QUEEK’ TEMPERS

“Ees jus’ the other way aroun,”
she exclaimed. “Eef someone do
something to you that you do not
like, you pop him one, no? Eet is
Americans who’ are queek tem-
pered. By golly, I weesh my
’usband were Mexican and then
maybe he learn to control his tem-
per better.” ,

Lupe waslcombing her shoulder-
length dyed-red hair with what

she calls a ‘hair-straightener
outer.’ It’s a heated comb which
takes the kinks out of hair and
“Oh, what thees damp Peetsburgh
weather is doing to eet!”

“What about superstitions of
stage folk, Miss Velez? It it true
that people in the theater have pet
superstitions?”

“Oh my yes,” she exclaimed ex-
citedly. “I am mos" superstitious
women een the world. Eef I lose
eye pencil that I start the show
weeth, I go mad.” '

Just then Toby Wing ambled in-
to the dressing room. Umph!

“Hello dear,” Toby greeted, ad-
dressing Lupe. “Haya feeling to-
night? May I have a cigarette,
hon?”

ENTER MISS WING

Lupe had been bothered with a
lung congestion lately.

“Oh, I am feeling much better,
darling. ’elp yourself.

“Are you superstitious Toby?” I
queried.

“Oh yes,” she emphatically re-
torted. “If anyone whistles in the
dressing room before a show, it is
a sign» that the person nearest the
door is going to be ﬁred.”

Somebody knocked on the door.

“Five minutes, Miss Velez.”

“Well, I mos’ dress now,” she
hinted.

“And I mos’ go now,” I replied.

Once again, she extended her
hand in a warm clasp. “Maybe
we meet again soon. ‘You never
know’.”

«» Minute mow/iow -

By Gertrude Messeroff and Mildred Axelrad

We plucked s. H. May, C41, out 9

of the wilted voting sunﬂowers at
Memorial Hall election last Fri-
day. It wasn’t because he was
wilted and tired that we couldn’t
understand his language. It was
because S. H. May has a dialogue
all his own.

S. H. May was mad at election
day. Before he voted the candi-
dates gave him lolly-pops, and
afterwards they gave him the
“one to go.”

Before we could ask him what
the quotes meant, he said he was
“brodying.” From his actions, we
gathered that “brodying” meant
getting out of the disgusting at-
mosphere (election not us) he was
in. So we brodied with him.

“One to go,” he said, “means
giving a person the air or the
hitchhiking ﬁnger.”

S. H. Mays comes from Mead-
owlands,, and their slang just
grew up with the drugstore cow-
boys.

He thinks all professors are
herring heads, and that school

sag“...

is She

always out

with Freddie when
you call? ‘

 

consists of too much “conning”
which means flippancy and jok-
mg;

His name is Salvadore Heze-
kiah, and the reason why he nev-
er tells anyone is obvious, but S.
H. May says that it’s ridiculous
that in this modern democratic
world, a man can’t even use his
own name. Most of his enemies
call him SHMay.

SHMay’s uncle has a ranch in
Texas, and SI-IMay says that Pitt
girls can’t compare with the Mex-
ican girls. They have hoop-la.

For a hobby, S. H. collects red
ants and black ants in respective
bottles, and when he feels playful,
he takes them out and puts them
together and watches a Pitt-Tech
football battle.

The biggest adventure of
SI-lMay’s life was his ﬁrst week in
school, when a short fat squat girl
spoke to him at registration. S.
H. fell in love. Now, he blames it
on the fact that it was the glam-
our of meeting a co-ed.

We wonder if he was “conning”
