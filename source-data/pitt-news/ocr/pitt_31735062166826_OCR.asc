   No Tuition Increase In January  

S, lated institution, is so directly related to

 

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(See editorial, “The Crisis Continues,”
Page 4.)

There will be no tuition increase for
University students in January. This
was affirmed by Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvtaxr in response to statements issued
last week concerning a possible tuition
hike of $965 a year to compensate for
the st.ate’s failure to provide the Uni-
versity with its allotted sum of $27 mil-
-lion for the current fiscal year.

Chancellor Posvar emphxas-ized t-he
“moral obligation” of the University to
keep -the tuitionfee at its current rate
of $225 a term for this entire year, in
spite of the fact that the Board of 'lY'us-
tees recently authorized the University
to borrow funds up -to $15 million in or-
der to meet operating expenses. He
stressed the “unequivocal obligation of
the State -to furnish the tuition subsidy

   

 

for students presently enrolled under
that tuition subsidy.”

The above -statements concerning a
possible tuition hike were the latest in
the series of “panic” remarks issued by
various state officials concerning the
University. One earlier comment made
by a Republican leader even stated that
the “University may never get its ap-
propriation.” All of this is a direct out-
growth of -the inability of Gov. Raymond
P. Shaifer and members of the ‘State Leg-
islature to agree on a tax package
which should -have been passed last June
-to go into effect for the ﬁscal year now
underway. The legislators and the Gov-
ernor are still disputing various points
i-n the proposed tax package, as state
government is virtually ground to a
halt.

Since the University, as a state-re-

 

One of Americp , :   

    

the current legislative stalemate, I went
to Harrisburg Monday to speak to leg-
islative leaders on both sides to try to
determine where we stand and whether
there is a real possibility of a tuition
increase for the next school year, if not
in January.

“You feel victim to Shafer’s scare
tactics,” I was told by State Rep. James
F. Clarke (D.-Pittsburgh). “Th-at’s ex-
actly what his purpose is ——blackmail,
black jack. He's trying to do everything
he can to force us to put everything in
our pockets.”

“'Ilhere’s absolutely no truth to the
rumor,” ‘reiterated House Minority Whip
K. Leroy Irvis (D.-Pittsburgh). He add-
ed that the Democrats “have taken a
stand absolutely against slashing the
budgets for the schoo .”

   

11! Pesllonse to my question concern-
ing the University’s tuition, I received
the following reply from House Major-
ity Whip Robert Butera (R. -Norris
town): “It is our hope that tuition will
not have to be raised, but to achieve
this we’ve got to raise taxes We've been
willing, but we need help from the Dem-
ocrats. If we don't get the 102 votes to
pass the taxbills, thenithereis apos-
sibllity."

House Majority Leader Lee Donald-
son (R.-Allegheny County) was noncom-
mital: “I hope that the General Assem-
bly will provide the money so that we
won't have to raise tuition." .

The air of uncertainty still prevails,
as the Governor and the legislative lead-
ers continue to meet several times daily
to ﬁnd that elusive solrwtimi to the prob-
lem at hand.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Professors Argue Type of Policy  
Needed To Cover Secret Research

by ANNE DORN

That the University is a
place to “gather and dissem-
inate knowledge” was the
only statement all speakers
agreed upon at the Pitt Liberal
Forum while discussing secret
research at the University.

Dr. Richard C. Tobias of the
Department of English believed
that the problem of secret re-
search was more than a matter
ofproandconandcalledita
“complex situation.” Dr. Tobias,
chairman of the Faculty Sen-
ate Committee on Academic
Freedom and Tenure, stated
no matter how strong a general
statement on secret research the
Senate adopted, “it would be a
pretty hard thing to enforce."

Therefore, his resolution, pre-
sently before the Senate, asks
for -the establishment of a Fac-
ulty Senate “Research Policy
Oommitztee.” This committee
would request various sections
of the University to establish
their own policy for classiﬁed
research. It would also be its
duty to see that the sections’
statements operate smoothly.

Dr. David Landy of the De-
partment of Anthropology, ad-
vocated a complete ban on all
secret research. He resolved
that “secret research and secret
activity are those that violate»
free access to data and ﬁndings
by any interested and qualiﬁed

THE LIBERAL FORUM discusses secret re-
search at the University. Seated from left to right

are Dr. Richard Tobias, Dr. Joseph Zasloff, Ar-

-scholar so long as conﬁdential-
ity of personal information is
not breached.”

He -also included in areas that
may be violated: “qwa.liﬂcations
for participation based on pro-
fessional competence and not on
political or other irrelevant cri-
teria; freely publishaible findings
without censorship -or control by
sponsoring or interested ‘bodies
except in the interest of pro-

After the presentation of

sources of ﬁnances."

Dr. Joseph J. Zasloﬂ’ of the
Department of »Political Science,
agreed with Dr. 'IJ8.I1dy in his
desire for -a ban on secret re-
search. ‘The University's role
in society is the -pursuit and dis-
semination of knowledge," -he
stated. To do this, the Univer-
sity needs “freedom of inquiry,”
which would be disturbed Iby an
outside agency.”

However, the government has
a “need to classify" their re-
search for the protection of na-
tional securlty. “It may be
tempting and useful for faculty
members to engage in secret

The following statement by
Dr. Richard Tobias, professor
of English, is a. correct state-
ment of the quotes he gave The
Pitt News last week: “No re-
search is done in the Washing-
ton office" of the University.
The Washington office produc-
es secret reports. The Univers-
ity is engaged in some secret
projects. My point was that the
Washington office is not doing

research,” but when there is a.
clash between the University
role and the government role,
the decision must be to accept
no classiﬁed research on a gov-
ernment contract.

Dr. Zasloff pointed out possi-
'ble drawbacksofabanomse
cret research. one of which is
the loss of good men due to Jim-
iting choice to faculty members.
There would be, though, “no
'fu-ndamenta-1 change in the Uni-
versity or its faculty."

Opposed to Dr. Landy’s stand
was Dr. Edward Gerjouty of
the Department of Physics. He
disagreed with Dr. Landy's set-
ting down a resolution because
“laws have to be rewritten. It is
diificuit to pxmcrilbe exactly
what you want.”

By condemning secret re-
-search, “We are banning awhole
area of investigation.” Dr. Ger-

Editorial: The Crisis Continues

We have been watching in disbelief these past few months as Gov.
Shafer and the state legislators have been unable to effect a compromise
on the tax program. The latest statements concerning a possible tuition
hike due to our not receiving our allotted funds irked us to the point of
actually going to Harrisburg while the legislature was in session to view
the situation ﬁrst-hand.

If we were amazed at the state officials’ failure to progress before
going to Harrisburg, we’re now in a state of shock. For the picture there
is more confused than it is here, if only for the fact that there are more
state officials there, all seemingly in different directions and none possess-
ingany deﬁnite answers. Everything was literally up in the air, as t-he
majority of the legislators waited around in their respective chambers
while the legislative leaders met almost continually with the Governor,
trying to effect a solution to the legislative stalemate.

Many with whom we spoke placed the failure to reach a com-
promise at the foot of the Governor. The legislative leaders had reported-
ly reached a solution two weeks ago, but the Governor refused to budge.
Informed sources told us that the Governor has alienated most of the
Republican legislative leaders, and that a main reason for the delay is the
internal strife among Republicans.

In line with this theory, State Rep. Gerald Kaufman (D.-Pitts-

burgh) made the following analysis-: “This ﬁght shows the weakness of
the legislative branch over the executive branch in state government.
The executive dominates us and the Republican leaders must therefore
be subordinate to the Governor.”

Harrisburg correspondents, who have ‘been on the scene for years,
reaffirm that the Governor is to blame for the stalemate lasting as long
as ‘it has. One newsman remarked that one of the legislative leaders, who
has been meeting regularly with Shafer, conﬁrmed to him that a solution
was reached by the legislators on both sides two weeks ago, but the Gov-
ernor would not accept it.

Looking towards the future, Rep. Kaufman stated that “ideally, in
the legislative branch, we ought to have the facilities, resources, and
strength to say ‘no’ to the Governor.” He added that he hoped steps will
be taken in this direction at the upcoming Constitutional Convention.

Getting back to the present state of affairs, we must state that we
have become tired of our school being used as a political football. It is
lamentable that we have become virtually victimized by our relationship
with the state, in that we never know where we stand and in what direc-
tion we are moving. We experienced a grave ﬁscal crisis two years ago.
Obviously, this situation is not comparable, but this “crisis” is similar in

that it also breeds insecurity. We wonder just how much we'll -have to take.

Letters To The Editor

Transfer Student

Hits Registration
Editor, The -Pitt News

Rivaling only the University’s ,

football team for ineptitude is
the -registration system. I have
never before seen such ineffec-

' tual and disorganized -operartion-

al procedures as I have experi-
enced at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Specifically I am refer-
ring to -such things as registra-

't‘ion, closed-course procedures,

schedule cards that return with-
out courses or with wrong -hours
and credits, courses that in no
possible way resemble the des-
cription in the catalogue, teach-
ers who arbitrarily change
courses and in many cases even
-the hours, and many more sit-
uation-s which, although I have
not experienced, I am sure have
occurred to the dismay and ag-
gravation of many students.
Now, many people may‘ re-
mark that these are common
s-it-uamions that occur in all large
uni-viersities. However, being a.
transfer student from a major
university approximately twice
the size of -Pitt, I say that not
only did -I -never encounter simi-
‘lar situations, but very rarely
did I hear similar complaints
from my classrnates. If a larger
university can successfully tac-
kle these problem (or shall I

say "injustlces” to the students),
then why not Pitt?

For instance, last year I was
closed out of a course, but I
was infoﬁned about this within
the week. I then had plenty of
time in  to register for an-
other course without fear of its
being closed. Also, there was no
necessity for a drop-add slip or
a -trip to" Student Records be-
cause my advisor took care of
-it all for me. Everyone, I am
sure, will agree with me that
the situation is much more com-

On Arm Bands

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is my rbeliefthat any stu-
dent who wears a white arm-
band is a disgrace to the very
principles that the people of this
country have been living under
ever since we established a fav-
orable balance of trade some-
time in the 1870's. In the Span-
ish-America-n War, we freed the
subjugated peoples of Cuba and
the Philippines from Spanish
dictatorial rule. We even gave
the people of Cuba the lPlatt
Amendment as a symbol of our
avowed interest in keeping them
free. They no longer had to
worry about foreign interven-
tiom We were there to protect
them. We even established a
naval base to keep our pledge,
and rpromised that we would
only intervene in the interest of
Cuban security, which naturally
coincided with American vested
interests.

No one can say , that we are
the police force of the world,
which these white armband
wearers seem to ‘be so sure of.
We know when to keep ou.r
noses clean. In fact, during the
Spanish Civil War in the late
1930's we knew better than to
intervene. After all, what quar-
rel did we have then with Fran-
co and his cohorts Hitler and
Mussolini. Moreover, Henry
Ford, surely one of the greatest
c.on.trirbu'tors to the rise of the
great American industrial ma-
chine was himself giving sup-
port to Hitler. Americans then
knew better than to try and go
against the i-ndustrialists, who
after all, are the representatives
of the American way of life.

Even -in present day affairs
with Latin American countries
we have left them alone to pros-
per under stable democratic
governments. We know that
they mu-s-t be democratic, or
else there would be absolutely
no reason for us to support
them. Take for example, Cuba
under Batista and the Domini-
can Republic -under Trujillo. We

supported them. and they  V

ed us gratitude by letting Amer-
ican private enterprise come in
and showithem the quickest way
to indusrtrizalization, the Ameri-
can way. The only possible qualm

» -of any Latin American -countries

who have let -us help them in-
dustrialize, is that none of the
wealth ﬁlters down to the mass-
es. 'But lets face it, without a
viable bourgeoisie, who would
there be to tell these peasants
how to spend their money? May
be 500,000 American advisors
could control the peasants, and
help them -to «help themselves.

This brings us to Vietnam. It
is more than obvious that the
people -there prefer capitalism
(American Democracy) to Com-
munism, of any kind. It is a
fact that .-the Vietnamese peas-
ants are highly ideological. They
have read both Marx and Hora-
tio Alger. They also realize that
a backward agricultural nation

’ would be much -more likely to

prosper quickly under capital-
-ism. As I have already men-
tioned, look at the prosperity
of Latin American nations, es-
pecially at their working classes.
There is obviously no need for
land reform, or a redistriburtion
of wealth. VVhy in their first
real election the South Vietna-
mese overwhelmingly voted for
the military candidate who was
coincidentally the choice of mo-st
good Americans. He received al-
most ten per cent of -the possi-
ble votes.

So, in actuality, our presence
in Vietnam is -a necessity if
these people are ever going to
become a spoke in the wheel of
the free world. We are -at the
center of that wheel, and it is
our divine res-ponsibi-lity to pro-
tect all of ou-r spokes, whether
they like it or not. After all we
di-dn't go in -ourselves. Diem
asked us in after we -refused
free elections in Vietnam, and
installed him as our ﬂub-a-dub.
Ike said that if elections were
held, wicked H-o would win
(and he's bad because he's a
Commie).

To end I would like to quote
a noted Austrian Revolutionary
Monk. Wolfram W. Swoboda,

, an olumrnis of the university,

who once said in a speech on
America's manifest destiny, “To-
day Vietnam,
worl ."

many teams eminently more
qualiﬁed to -play in the Sugar
Bowl than Army. The Pentagon
actually did the football pub-
lic a favor by keeping Army
out -of the bowl and allowing a
more qualiﬁed team play. Army's

qualiﬁcation to play in the Su-

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Sports Editor

As the successful football sea-
sons end in the Chip Hilton sports
stories, everyone on campus cries:
“King Football is dea-d! Long live
King Basketball!”

What in the name of Frank Car-
‘ ver does anyone have to cheer about
0 here?
0 ' What does the sportsminded stu-
dent at Pitt have to look forward
. to? This year’s senior class has en-
joyed eight (count ’em, eight) vic-
tories in 40 football games. Losing
game after game certainly adds
spice to the academic year.

_ While on the delightful subject
of losing (it makes great reading),
the Panthers, it should be known,
were thoroughly embarrassed and
totally disgraced at Penn State last
Saturday, 42-6.

It seemed to the out-of-town
writers as if the football team, par-
ticularly the defensive unit, wanted

Nittany Lions. Bazylak had little support in his ﬁnal game as the Panthers lost, 42-6.

Will the Losing Attitude E

to get the season over as painlessly
as possible. That explained, the writ-
ers reasoned, why the Panthers
werent’ hitting anybody. The only
contact a Panther, had, several ob-
servers chuckled, was when he col-
lided with a teammate.

This is not to take anything away
from a great Penn State team, which
Dave Hart feels is in a class with
Notre Dame, Miami, and UCLA. The
Lions had the better football play-
ers Saturday. However, they also
had the better mental attitude, and
that’s half the game of football.

Paul Martha, former Pitt All-
American and now a Pittsburgh
Steeler, said in a telep-hone inter-
views the other day that football
“from high school to college is an
emotional game.

“When Pitt went 9-1 in 1963,”
Martha emphasized, “our winning
attitude had a lot to do with it. We
felt we could "beat any team we
played. And when you have 11 guys

' his Steeler teammates.

 

 

who feel that way, you’re not go-
ing to be beaten in the third and
fourth quarter. And if you’re trail-
ing, you’re going to come from be-
hind and win.”

Martha pointed out that the op-
posite feeling exists with some 'of
He didn't
have to say that Pitt football was
in the same situation.

“If you get a bad break at the
beginning of a game,” he explained,

“it’s like sticking a pin into a bal-'

loon. Some teams get to the point
that no matter what you do, you’re
going to lose. You could be ahead
by four touchdowns with ﬁve min-
utes left and still feel ,_you’ll lose.”
With Penn State leading, 7-0, in
the ﬁrst quarter, Gary Cramer fum-
bled directly into a Lion linebacker’s
arms. Four plays later, State full-
back Don Abbey fumbled as he tried
to score. Again the ball landed un-
der the body of a Lion lineman,
while an anguished Joe Curtin fell
on him, a split second too late.
“If you get a break at the begin-
ning,” continued Martha, “or an out-
standing individual performance, or
a ‘big break in the third quarter, it
will pick up the entire team.
“Penn State’s sophomores play
with seniors who have won before,”
Martha noted. “With them, it’s a
snowball effect. Even without the
experience, their sophs soon think
they can leap tall buildings in a sin-
gle bound. They keep winning.”
Behind 28-0 in the third quarter,
Panther soph George Medich faked
a punt and threw a pass to soph Joe
McCain. here was no one within 25
yards of McCain, but he either did-
n’t see the pass or it was under-
thrown and he couldn't grab it. So
instead of the big break to spark
the Panthers, Penn State had the
ball at the Pitt 40.
Martha could recall when the
Panthers had trailed Syracuse by

three touchdowns and had gone on
to win. The difference between his
team and the 1-9 teams is mental
as well as physical.

What -do the Panthers have to
foster that winning attitude? It’s
certainly not the mudbath at Trees
Field where they practice. Nor is it

the food they eat at training tables. ‘

Nor is it the grades they worry
about.

’ What's going to psych them in
the seven games they win next
year? Assuming most of the fresh-
men stay in school, only Notre
Dame, Miami, and UCLA are un-
feasible next season. But without
that proper mental attitude, they’ll
probably split those other games
and wind up 3-7.

And where will they go from
there? C-an Hart continue to sell a
school that has nothing to offer the
good football player? Will Hart be
around to try? Will Hart want to be
around to try?

Fcoaches on campus, Grant of-
- fers a promising future.

“We’re hoping to upgrade the
program as much as we can,”
said the coach. “We hope to be
-\ in. line wit:h the best -in the East.
 We have an outstanding ﬂacility
in Trees Pool and in the future
we ‘hope to be in national con-
. ’ tentlion."

The future is still several

years off, and right now the pro-
gram must be at an all time low.
 The squad is extremely small in
. size, numbering only ‘11 swim-
~ mers and two divers. Those fig-
:,__ures can be contrasted to 16
~ freshmen swimmers and ﬁve
“fr‘osh divers. There is not one
sophomore on the varsity.
 “We have seniors, juniors, and
i freshmen,” elaborated Grant.
"“Dave Hart had that problem
-'0 when he came here too, and all
we can do now is -recruit. I've
, -been all over selling our pro-
. gram."

Coach Grant revealed that al-
ready over 40 Pospective swim-
 mers have applied for admis-
sion,, many of them without any
real recruiting pressure.

But there will be a lot of pres-
, sure on the current varsity also.
.Because of the addition of two

style and three meter" diving-

ly. They’ve been bearing down.

A second and a point was
all that kept the freshman
cross country team from win-
ning the IC4A Invitational Meet
titles last _Monday.

The frosh harriers ﬁnished be-
hind Georgetown University tor
the team title, 109-110, and Jer-
ry Richey was just nipped at the
tape in his quest for the individ-
ual title. This was the ﬁrst loss
for both Richey and the team.

“He and we should have won
it,” felt coach Jim Banner about
Richey’s and the team’s per-

formance. “Jerry ran a tremen-
dous race. Our strategy was for
Jerry to go out fast and take
the lead and maintain it. He just
fell a little short.”

Richey was beaten by Villano-
va’s Martin Liguori. Liguori
trailed Richey for most of the
three mile race over the Van
Cortland Park course. He ﬁnal-
ly caught Richey in the stretch
and crossed the wire 1.4 seconds
faster in 14:20.8. Both boys
broke the course record. Banner
felt that Liguori’s victory was

  Cagers Sharp, Drub Fresh

by MIKE BROURMAN
Now that the preliminaries are over, the
basketball team is getting ready for the
‘real thing. They open the season Friday night

at Rutgers.

Coach Bob Timmons continues to display con-
ﬁdence in his team despite the poor -records of
the past three years. And, his conﬁdent attitude
was somewhat bolstered by the varsi-ty’s ﬁne per-
formance last Monday against the freshman
team in their third annual meeting.

The varsity turned what was expected to be
a close game into a rout, rolling up a 48-13 half-
time advantage, and coasting to a 96-54 «triumrph.

“\’Ve were ready and that was the big thing,”
said Timmons in explaining the runaway. “The
freshman had been confident that they would

more good players. The pressure defense really
got to the treshxnen. Like all young, green ball

Len Kalata led the varsity with 21 points,
and Timmons was impressed by his play. “Len
did real well,” he said. “He's been scoring well
for us and he's been picking up on his defense.
He's coming along and getting more aggressive."

However, Kalata probably will not start
against Rutgers. “Most likely we'll go with the
same group that -started against the frosh," Tim-
mons disclosed. That would mean Mike Patcher
at center, Rob Mcﬁlarlland and Ken Bollens at the
forward spots, and Bob Petrini and Pete Smith
as the guards. - ‘

Bill Grant’s First Squad Future After IC4A Second Place
-Lacks Necessary Depth

by ROY JACOBS
Bill Grant is out to make a big splash at Trees Pool.
In his first year as head swimming coach, Grant, a
University alumnus who coached 12 years at Mt. Lebanon, inherits
 the problems of another of the Athletic Department's troubled

a good one, but “the next time
Richey faces Liguori the out-
come will be reversed with Jer-
ry on top.” _

Looking back on the season,
Banner -is very proud of the
team’s -continual improvement,
especially Richey’s. “Jerry has

come along real ﬁne and seemed _

to improve each time out,” he
said. “He is a ﬁne athlete and
a true gentlemen.‘ He has the
desire to win and to be great.
This is 90 per cent of the battle
in becoming a great runner.”

Richey added to his ﬁne sea-
son by placing fourth in Sat-
urday National Federation Cross
Country Championships in Col-
-orado. This was a major na-
tional meet and was not limited
to only freshmen. Richey de-
feated two "former NCAA track
charnpions, Oscar Moore and
Doug Brown, on his way to
what Banner called “a -truly
ﬁne perf.-ormance.”

Banner also singled out Greg
Rodgers for praise. Rodgers,’
who has been running right be-
hind Richey this season, placed
14th in the IC4A’s. Banner says
that “Greg has been the most
improved rimner on the team
and I am very pleased with his

. performance at New York.”

Banner hopes :to improve the
team’s competitiorn for next sea-
son. In an effort to obtain bet-
ter opponents and increase the
school's name in cross country,
Banner has dropped some of
the smaller colleges from the
schedule -and has added the
Notre Dame Invitational and
possibly Navy to next year's
schedule. * V

Lacl-1 of Depth Makes
Grant’s Debut Rough

(Conl‘2'n71e7' from Page 6)
They'll make a good accounting
of themselves and we should
make a credible showing in the
Easterns and Nationals

The swimmer that Grant is
ptrobtabtly counting on most is
John Lane.

“Lane could be one of the out-
standing middle and long dis-
tance swimmers in the East,"
predicted Grant. And the extra
events shouldn't l111rt him. “John
is physically strong‘ enough to
take all the work you can give
l1in1. He thrives on hard work."
