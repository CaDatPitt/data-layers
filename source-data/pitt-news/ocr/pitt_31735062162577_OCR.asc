European Travel Program
.One of the most promising and _most worthwhile com-

mittees that has been created" within theuniversity recently
is the Europe 1960 Committee. The result of Europe 1960’s

_ rwork, announced this week, bears this out.

..The

Next- summer, from Aug. 2 to Sept..7 to be exact, stu-
dents, faculty, alumni and their families will have an_oppor.-
tunity to travel to Europe. The fare for the round'—trip,

‘ $295, .on the chartered plane, is extremely reasonable.

The tour offers many advantages. In general, it adds
greatly to theu=niversity’s extra-curricular educational pro-
gram." - _ - . ‘ T '

' More speciﬁcally‘, ‘the idea of having the trip last four
weeks is good. It enables the students or faculty who are at

;che university-nduringthe third trirnester"to' "go on thetrip
‘while enabling others to ‘work from the end of thesecond
_ trimester until the trip starts, giving them extra money.

A four—week period also is useful for those -who cannot
ﬁnancially afford to‘ have a lengthy stay abroad. '

d On the other hand, the four-week period offers disad-
vantages. The biggest dirawback, no doubt, is that the_ time
is too short for anyone to see enough of Europe. As .,most
students and ‘faculty members who have ‘been abroad

-would attest, the “Old World” deserves much more than
a four—week look. In fact, most persons could travel in
Europe for a whole summer and not satisfy their desires.

' Thus, there arises a need -for a longer tour. The commit-
teeundoubtedly has done’ a great a'mount,of work in lining
up the trip ‘for next summer. With the thoughtlin mind that
this initial attempt ‘will-be a huge success—the possibility
of any other result seems remote——-the committee should be-
gin formulating“-'* plans for a more extensive program.‘

‘ It appears reasonable to expect that in the near future
university ;,students,_ faculty and alumni will have the op-

‘ portunity to have a choice of tours. ’

. In other words, we would ‘liketo see at least two and A

rpossibly three separate trips: "a short one as now exists; a
much longer trip ,lasting perhaps the entire summer; and a
third one of medium length, maybe six to eight Weeks.

The opportunities such a program would offer. and the
beneﬁts it would. reap need not be listed. An extensive
European travel program deﬁnitely is worth the effort the
committee could put into it-. ‘

Summer Report: 6 . . .

Arlesienne

By David Breokstone

When our blue bus rumbled into the square at
Arles the clock on the Hotel de Ville softly bonged
No sound drifted from "the
adjacent park; a grey cat padded sluggishly along
the gutter of the shady street, taking a few quick
jumps ahead now and again as
she came into a hot patch of
sunlight. _ ‘

The tourists swung quickly
down to the ground, and as my
feet hit the pavement I looked '
about for some people. I ﬁnally
spotted‘ an ice cream vendor, and
some boys sitting in a dark cafe
down the block.

“What are you looking for,
my friend?” our black-haired

guide asked me with a charac-
teristic chuckle in his voice.

once, then silence.

 

“I just wondered where everyone is. I know it’s
lunchtime, but . .” _

“In the South no ‘one is‘ on the streets from
twelve to three, no one,” he-interrupted with a
wave of his hand, “except the curious, of course!”

Cate Search

He announced to his little band that there
would. be a two-hour break for lunch, and those
who wanted to “eatwell” were welcome to accom-
pany him to a true Provencal restaurant. I jangled
the 600 francs in my pocket again, realizing that
I would have to forego'the ﬁne cuisine if I wanted»
to -get back to Grenoble without hitch—hiking.

I wandered down the dusty square, surveying
the row of sidewalk cafes and their menus. After

- ﬁnding the shadiest spot, which happened to be the

cheapest, I sat down at a marble—topped table
-and and ordered as cheese sandwich and a glass
of beer.’ The cafe was nearly empty and smelledof
fermented grapes, years of them.

In the back, a young boy in white sandals was
playing a pinball machine which ﬂickered with red
and yellow letters spelling “All Star Football.” A
cluster of men on my left were listening to a juke
box wail out an Israeli folk song‘ (in Provence yet).

After an hour had passed" and not much else,
I got ‘up'and headed for a park I had seen before,
down at the end of the square. Upon entering the
little world of greenery‘ I found that many of the
townspeople were there, hiding from the heat
under the trees. Following the gravel path I came
to a tall spike fence behind which I could see a
lawn strewn with white stones and broken pillars.

Roman Remains

I found a sign at the far end of the fence that
announced that this was the remains of the great
Roman theatre. Annoyed at not having recognized

the landmark without help, ‘I gave my camera

strap a tug and strode away afraid that the 4Ar_‘- .

lesiens would spot my naivete.
I found my exploring party sitting lethargically
around the fountain in front of the Church of St.

Trophime. The guide, Jean, was ruefully patting

his belly, prominent under his white shirt. “I ate"
too much, I think. I really need a nap now,” he
groaned. . i ‘

‘‘Oh ho,” interjected the bus driver, who had.

strolled unsteadily up behind him. “Try that and
I’ll take your half of the day’s pay too! Get moving,
lazy. We leave at 5:30 sharp. Wake me up when

you get back to the bus." He laughed loudly and

navigated cautiously down the street.
Jean led us into the cool, black church, talked

briefly about the Roman—Proven‘cal architecture,

and then proceeded to the Cloisters in the rear. The

cloisters of St. Trophime, a covered promenade-

which surrounds a garden courtyard, is well-known
and justly so. The secluded pillared walkway is

Romanesque on the north and east sides, and"

Gothic on the south and west.

Span of the Centuries _
The sculptured panels, roof, and pillars are

intricately beautiful and the transition from the
province of the Olympian gods into the domain ,of,_
the'New_ Testament gave me the odd feeling that‘

time. was standing still. Next, ‘we marched into
the Roman theater a few blocks away, and I got
a full view of what I had spied from the park.
Little actually has. survived the harsh years,_. but
enough remains to suggest the stage, the audience's
tiered benches, and the exits. I

The Roman. arena’ is a few hundred yards away,
on a small hill near the Rhone. In the first cen-
tury, B.C., it seated 20,000 Roman citizens of Arles

' who watched gladitorial games and martyr—to-the-

lions spectacles. Today, on the weekends, the blood
of animals stains the sand of the arena again as

Luis Dominguin and others ﬁght ‘-bulls to the de- '

light of you know who.

Then the Alyscamps, the Roman necropolis
where the great citizens of the Empire were in-
terred in great stone boxes. 10,000 nobles rested
there, and their coﬁins still lie, row on mute row
under ‘the poplars.

At [5:30 I pounded on the door of the bus,
rousing tire chauffer from post—prandial slumber.
We all slumped wearily into our seats, and dozed
rockingly during the fast ride back to Avignon.
At 7, I waved to Jean, who was standing beside
the blue bus, as my train for Grenoble moved out
of the station.
peared, the weekend in Provence vanished in the
darkening distance.

Something For All

By. Deborah Willson

Last Friday at noon a group of students, really
rather small in number, sat and listened to at most

learned man speak on a clearly presented topic of i

interest. The man was Dr. Fowler of the history
department; his topic: zen buddhism.

Dr. Fowler, as always, spoke well; he gave a
short history of zen buddhism, ‘
and brieﬂy stated some of its
characteristics. Probably a few of - '
the people who heard him will
come back,‘ perhaps bringing
friends, to ask questions in the
further discussion period sched-
uled for this Friday in G 24'
at noon.

l.But probably more of the
people there last week, who only
came in thevﬁrst place because" ~
“zen.” is supposed to be “beat” or
“intellectual,” and they had some vague idea they
could sound that way too if they went, will go
back to sitting in the Tuck Shop or the cafeteria

- that hour, or even perhaps in the library reading

Life magazine.

The Inquiry Club, which sponsored Dr. Fowler’s
address, (and incidentally, always has excellent
programs at noon on Fridays) is by no means the
only such group sponsoring, worthwhile’ events on
campus; Many of them encourage students‘ to bring
their lunches, with them, so loss of the lunch hour
is certainly not a» deterrent for most students.

Yet‘ these events, most. of which are -fairly well-
pubhcized, are but sparingly attended. Oh, there

     

 

are a few “faithful ones” who are always present,
but what about the rest of the students? Is‘ there
nothing that interests them?

Last week a column appeared on this page
commenting on the students apathy as far as
“school spirit” goes. If they won't go to pep rallies,
aren’t interested in zen buddhism, what then, can
arouse students. Perhaps we could convince a pro-

fessor or two to ﬁght some angry lions——it worked ,

for the Romans, it might for us. /
There are certainly enough programs and lec-

Cats Expect Fight

From Mountaineers

By TED COLTON
The hostile hills of West Virginia will be awaiting in
secret prey for the high riding Panthers as Coach Johnny
Michelson sends his aggregation against the Mountaineers
Saturday at Morgantown. Game time is set for 1:30 p.m. EST.
.“They will be loaded for bear,” stated. Michelosen when
asked about how good he thought the Mountaineers will be.
The big Mountaineer may be:

loaded for bear, but he better
watch out for that Panther who

rwill be on the prowl Saturday.

Three doubtful players for the
Cats will belFullback Jim Cun-
ningham, Guards Bob Longfellow
and Regis Coustillac. Cunningham
and Longfellow were out of the
Duke game while Coustillac was
suited up, he did not see action.

Injuries Could Respond

All three boys are still consid-

ered ‘on the injured list but if

their injuries respond to treat-
. merit this week all _of them could

see action against the Moun-
taineers. '

iThe injury to Cunningham
has caused Michelosen a little
but the Panther‘ tutor
came up with a surprise move
Duke last Saturday
when he moved Halfback Curt

, Plowman to the fullback posi-

tion.

Plowman will remain there if
Cunningham isnot able to go at
full strength by Saturday. In four
previous games ' Michelosen has
come up with a sophomore or two

.who has played outstanding ball.

Against Marquette it was Half-

back Ray-‘Tarasi, at USC it was

Guard Larry Vignali, with UCLA
it was End Steve Jastrzembski
and Back Fred. Cox and ﬁnally

"against Duke. it was End Hey-

wood Hasér and Back Bob Cle-

. mens.

Big “Mike” has a lot of sopho-
mores left on the bench and it’s

' ‘anyone’s guess who will" be the '

' sophomore of the day when the
Panthers battle West Virginia.

» ‘The Cats offensive -‘attack was

much improved against Duke for

Chuck Reinhold

after three weeks‘ of being hamp-
ered with injuries‘. Fred Riddle
"seemed to have the’ old spark

‘back that made him the Cats lead-
ing ground gainer in his sopho-

more year.

And Ivan Toncic seems to be
completely recovered from his leg
injury, and is now able to roll

-a eleven. Although the Moun-

taineers have impressed practically nobody _in dividing the

first four games on its schedule the Panthers hadibetter not

take them lightly.

A victory over the Panthers would ‘make this _a. success-

ful season for the Mounties.no¢ 1

matter what the rest of their
schedule produces. _
With the loss of nearly two-
thirds of the lettermen who com-
piled a losing record in 1958, West
Virginia’s football outlook would
appear dim. But a host of good-
looking sophomores promise to
make the rest of the season in-
teresting for both Mounty fans
and opponents. -
Only 12 Lettermen
Coach Art. “Pappy” Lewis,
rounding out adecade at West
Virginia hashad to build his
squad around the fewest letter-
men .he’s ever h'ad——12. Thirty-
three members of his squad are
sophomores. V
After rebuilding Mountaineer
football fortunes virtually from
scratch, Lewis enjoyed a brilli-
ant four-year term 1952-55 in
which Freddy Wyant quarter-
backed some almost fabulous
~material.=
The next year, 1956; led to dis-
aster on the recruiting front and
last season West Virginia began

Booters to Encounter Strong

to pay. From the class that enter-
ed WVU four years ago, ,only four
remain as senior members of the
squad — Halfbacks Dave Rider
and Ray Peterson, Center Joe
Wirt_h and ‘End ,Ben McComb.
Williams Leads Attack

In Danny Williams, the Moun-
ties 3have ‘a quarterback who is
not only an effective passer but a
dangerous runner as well. If the
West Virginians _are to upset Pitt,
Williams, Rider, and _Peterson will
have to be veritable dynamos in
Saturday’s contest. 1 c

The Panthers will be attempt-
ing to extend their winning
skein to three before they have
to undertake the lethal‘ second
half of their schedule.

Although the Mountaineers will
be at a frantic pitch for. Satur-
day’s tilt, the Cats shouldehave
very little trouble disposing of
them. .
