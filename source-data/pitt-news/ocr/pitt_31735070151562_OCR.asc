A Pitt music ‘ professor will be recognized
for his achievements in jazz education this
weekend. . ,

The Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation plans to
present Nathan Davis, a professor emeritus in
Pitt’s Department of Music, with itsjazz 2013
Living Legacy Award. Each year, the founda-
tion issues the award to a living master of live
jazz from the mid-Atlantic region.

“Nathan’s world-renowned talent and his

' steadfast and uncompromising commitment

to jazz education are truly remarkable,” Jim
McDonald, BNY Mel1on’s managing director of
global philanthropy and employee programs,
said in a statement. '
McDonald described Davis as “a longtime

friend who has used his gifts to help thousands
of students while entertaining audiences glob-
ally.” '

Davis will receive the award at thejohn  .

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

Davis came to Pitt in 1969 as the director
ofthejazz Studies Program.

Davis is the founder of Pitt’s annual jazz
Seminar and Concert, whichwillbe held from
Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 this year. The serninarfeatures
lecmres from internationally recognized art-
ists and a live performance.

“I wanted to bring dignity — the same
dignity and respect afforded physicians, phi-
losophers and other scholars in academia —— to
jazz,” Davis said in the same statement. “And
that, I think, Iwas ‘able to do.” I

Program expands access to fresh produce

Kathleen Fennell
. Suﬁ Writer. 

The federal government aimed to help low-
income shoppers avoid the stigma of welfare
when it told states to replace food stamps with
cards that resemble debit cards.

But Emily Schmidlapp, who works for a
local non-proﬁt organization that caters to
the poor,said that the equipment needed to
process these cards is too expensive for com-
munity markets. " I V I

“So, when that change happened, all of a ‘T

sudden people couldn’tuse theirfood stamps
at farmers markets anymore, which was a
shame because that’s often where the healthi-

est, freshest and most affordable food is,”
she said. , .

Among this season’s fruits and vegetables
at Pittsburgh Citiparks Farmers Markets,
shoppers found a new booth that functions
as the markets’ ATM, at which market—goers
can tell an attendant how much they would
like to spend. .

Then, the attendant swipes their card for
the speciﬁed amount and distributes wooden
tokens for the shopper to spend at the other
vendors’ booths. .

According to the Pittsburgh Food Bank,
more than 160,000 people in Allegheny
County were receiving beneﬁts under the
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program

(SNAP),whichis ranby the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and replaced the old food stamps
program injanuary of 2013. ,

Under the Fresh Access program, which
local nonproﬁt Just Harvest launched last
summer, SNAP beneﬁciaries can buy tokens
at the market that they can redeem like cash.

Schmidlapp, who oversees the Fresh Ac-
cess program, said she started volunteering
at the nonproﬁt injanuary of 2012 and started
working there last April.

She began gathering informa_t1'on about
similar programs in other cities and, using
knowledge gained through her workwith the

FOOD STAMPS

Farmers at Firehouse Market —— which started »

accepting EBT cards last year — created a
plan to institute the Fresh Access Program
on a larger scale. ‘ '

The Fresh Access program started at the
Citiparks markets on the North Side and East
Liberty. Afterthe programwas successful, the
organization expanded it to four additional
markets. The Citiparks market in the Down-
town neighborhood is the only one that does
not use the Fresh Access because most of the
items there qualify as prepared food, which
SNAP beneﬁts do not cover.

Schmidlapp said Just Harvest chose the
Citiparks markets because they are the largest
group of markets under the same manage-
ment. .

“It’s giving people the opportunity and the
option to have fresh, healthy food available to
them that they didn’t have before,” said Carly
Cottone, aPitt senior majoringin socialwork
and an intern atjust Harvest.

The Fresh Access program will also culti-
vate healthier diets. ’

Cottone said that the Fresh Access Pro-
gram helps to alleviate fooddeserts, or low-
income areas where stores often do not carry

-, fresh foods. This, she said, means that the

program helps to provide low-income Pitts-
burgh residents with more access to fruits,
vegetables, meat and eggs.

Christopher Keane, a professor in Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public Health, said that
‘‘low income” correlates with “lower intake,”
highlighting the need for programs like Fresh
Access. '

‘“‘Itis importantto ﬁnd strategies thatwill
increase consumption among that group,” he

gasasaegseeeeesssseea

/

said in an email. ,
He said empirical evidence suggests pro-

gramsthatsubsidizefruit andvegetable con- _

sumption can be effective. .
According to a 2008 study using data on

recipients of the Women, Infants and .Chil- :

dren program, women who received a fruit-
and—vegetable subsidy ate more fruits and
vegetables. .

_While that may seem intuitively obvious,
the results showed that women who received
the subsidy continued to eat healthier in the
six months after they stopped receiving the
subsidies. '

Margaret Schlass, the owner and founder 1.
of One Woman Farm, began growingfoodﬁve

years ago in the Pittsburgh suburbs ofvalencia
and Gibsonia. She sells her certiﬁed-organic
produce at the East Liberty Farmers Market.

Her stall cooperates with the new pro-

gram, and she’s seen positive results because '

of the increased number of customers, as well
as the ease of swiping. ’

She said that the Fresh Access program
creates a win—win situation for everyone in-

volved at the markets because farmers would i

not ordinarily receive business from SNAP
recipients. . V ’
“They can get a lot of bang for their buck

. right here at the farmers market,” Schlass

said, referring to shoppers who utilize the
new program. “Theirfood dollars stay directly.
in our community and you create personal
relationships with them, so it’s a really nice
exchange.” '
Aeros Lillstrom and Chris Brittenburg own

New Bethlehem, Pa. The couple sells their
organicfruits, vegetables and herbs at the
East Liberty Farmers.Market. ‘
Lillstrom said the program has stimulated

Living close to home: Students must

balance independence and family

- Naomi Borrebach
Columnist

For many of us, going away.

to college doesn’t necessarily
mean driving for hours or buy-
ing plane tickets, but loading up
the minivan for a short drive to a
campus near where we grew up.

According to an article in The
New York Times last week, the
trend of students staying close
to home is increasing nationally.
The article proﬁles college stu-
dents, especially freshmen, who

I chose to go to college close to

home even though they applied

to colleges farther away.
_Three years ago, I was a

freshman at Pitt living in a

dorm about 30 minutes away A

from my parents’ house. By that
point in my ﬁrst semester, I was
starting to feel at home at Pitt,
even though I really wasn’t far
from my parents’ house and I
was living in the city in which I
grew up. After making the short

drive home for fall break, I asked _

my mom if she-would take me
“home” — to my dorm — early
so I could see my new friends.
Going home to do laundry was
not exactly high on my list of
priorities. " V ~ - , '

s While Igghad initially wanted
to go far away from home for
college, the logistics of having
me and all three of my siblings
in college atthe same time made

4 _ it m9r_e_rea_listic for us to stay

close?to'homé. A lot of students
in Pennsylvania also make the

r-‘-cho“ice5to7stay in-state, whether
..fqr--ﬁnaneialgor other practical

reason ."_Sffixty-lsevenlpercent of

if Pitt’s‘freshm'an class this year is

.  nia; and~—17~per-- 

cent is from Allegheny County,
like me.
As the author of the New

York Times article points out, __

having Mom and Dad so close
to your college life can make it
difficult to deﬁne boundaries.
Asking your parents to bring
you your favorite groceries af-
ter their Costco trips can turn
into never buying your own food
or_cooking anything for your-
self. I’ll admit that over the past
couple years, my parents have
helped me repair things in my
dorm room and taken me to the
doctor when I’ve gotten sick ——-
things that most students have
to ﬁgure out by themselves. Hav-
ing never been forced to be com-
pletely independent, I’m quite

so possibly less prepared for being »

a “real adult.” '

For local students who are
still trying to ﬁgure out the po-
tential awkwardness of living
close to home, remember that
your parents most likely want to
help you out and see you every
now and then, but they also want
you to have your own life. Even
if you live close enough to your
parents to go home for dinner
every night, you should still go
to Market Central with your new
friends. Don’t infringe on your
parents’ kindness by bringing
home all of your dirtyvwlaundry
from the past month. A

Even though your parents are
right there to help you, try to
navigate things like your own
health.(j.a;fs=Z; credit cardbills,
taxes”a-ntl lkea furniture set-up
as .Vin,dependently as youfcan.
Doiibtless, ygur -.pare’n'ts1’will

‘ help ‘you’ out 5* lot at ﬁrst, but

 on

more adult responsibilities as
you get older will make your
transition to being a “real adult”
much smoother. ’

A beneﬁt of going to college
close to home is being able to
spend time with siblings and
other family. One of my brothers
currently goes to Pitt, and an-

other graduated from Pitt’s grad

school last year. If you have the
opportunity, hanging out with
your siblings when you’re not
all living at home can make your
relationships better and more
mature. If you’re living close to
some of your siblings but you
never really hang out with them
except when your parents make
you, try spending time with
them on your own terms. Even
though a lot of people try to get
away from their siblings when
they go to college, forming a bet-
ter relationship with your fam-
ily while you’re in college will
deﬁnitely help you when you’re
home for the summer.

Even if you really wanted to
go farther away for college, you
might_ﬁnd that living close to
home has a lot of perks. Strike
a balance between mooching
off your parents and pretend-
ing that they don’t exist: Go
home for family birthdays and
to visit your parents every now
and then, but try to exist as in-
dependently as possible. Don’t
make going home an excuse to
get a ﬂu shot, have your parents
iron your clothes or have them
sort out your credit score for
you. Work on_building'a more

Pitt women’s volleyball looks to continue its
ACC success this weekend when the Pan-
thers host two conference opponents at the
Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt plays Friday at 7

p.m. againstvirginia Tech and Saturday at 7 _

p.m. against the University of Virginia.

Pitt (10—5, 2-0 ACC) looks‘ to extend its
home winning streak to three after ousting
ACC opponents Georgia Tech and Clemson.
Pitt is currently one of ﬁve schools in the ACC
that is still undefeated after playing its ﬁrst
two conference matches. The Panthers are

. joined at the top of the rankings by No. 11

North Carolina, No. 18 Florida State, Duke
and Miami.

The last time the Panthers started their .

conference season off with a 2-0 record was
in 2009.

“We are really excited,” junior setter Lind-
sey Zitzke said of Pitt’s start in the new con-
ference. “I think we just keep taking it from
here. We didn’t know what to really expect
coming into the ACC, and we are really happy

Pitt wraps up

Megan Boyle
Stcyf Writer '

This weekend, the Pitt softball team travels
to Moon, Pa., for a Saturday doubleheader
against Robert Morris University and Cali-
fornia University of Pennsylvania, the ﬁnal
two games of the fall season.

The fall campaign has been used as a
learning experience for the 19-29 Panthers,
and these last two games  be Pitt’s:ﬁnal
prep before their seasonbegins‘ in the spring
semester. P  i .

Pitt head coach Holly Aprile (said that ~

there are advantages to the fall season.

fall season slate during Weekend matchups

“It’s free substitution, so we’re allowed to
see more people in more situations,” Aprile
said, in contrast to the usual game substitu-
tion limitation. “We use it to get a feel for how
we’re going to perform in a game. We scrim-
mage in practice but it’s just -not the same.”

The outcomes of games in the fall do not
impact teams’ spring records because the
current matches are not considered in-season
play. However, that doesn’t mean the Pan-
thers do not take these games seriously. The
team must adapt to all of the substitutions
and new members of the squad.

“In the fall, we’re trying out new things

_ and getting adjusted with each other,” juniof

second baseman Maggie Sevilla ‘said. “We’re
still a fairly young team.”

The Panthers’ roster consists of four fresh-
men and eight sophomores, with no seniors.

California, like Pitt, ﬁelds a young team,
as the roster is evenly split between freshmen
and juniors.

Last season, the Vulcans — who face the
Panthers Saturday at 1 p.m. — went 38-6.
Most impressive about this record, though,
is that the team did not lose on the road — a
clean 14-0 record. Ayoungforce on the team
is sophomore utility player Lindsay Reicoff.
The Pittsburgh native sported the team’s
highest batting average (.401), most RBIs

(44) and second—most home runs (13). With
Reicoff leading the offense, fellow sophomore
Alex Sagl has been dominating the pitching
mound. Sagl has a 1.55 ERA and 20-3 record.

As opposed to Pitt and CalU, Robert Mor-
ris — Pitt’s opponent at 5 p.m. on Saturday
— has a veteran squad that propelled them
to a 30-17-1 season last spring. Sophomore
inﬁelder Ashley Gerhart, one of eight.up—
perclassmen on the team, leads the squad
in hits (50), runs (28), stolen bases (10) and
batting average (.347).Junior pitcher Nicole

’ Sleith posted a 1.59 ERA in the spring of 2012

— the best mark by any RMU pitcher since
1998 — while also notching 251 strikeouts
and holding her opponents to a .222 batting
average. In the 2013 season, Sleith boasted
a 1.73 ERA, winning 17 of the 26 games she
competed in.

With each opponent posing different
strengths, junior inﬁelder Carissa Throck-
morton said she expects the team to beneﬁt
from such early exposure. ‘

.“We have a couple of things to work on, but
[these games} point those things out so we can
work on them over winter,” Throckmorton
said. “That way we’re good to go in the spring.”

At this time of the year, it’s not aboutwins
for the Panthers. Accordingto Aprile, the fall
season’s real value lies in the early opportu-
nity to scout the young players on Pitt’s team.
The fall games allow for a glimpse of how the
players operate as a unit, how they learn to
communicate on the ﬁeld and how they react
to situations —— all of which will ultimately
determine their success when the games re-

ally count. I -

with the results right now.”

When the Panthers take the court Friday
night, they will face a Virginia Tech squad
that they have not faced in a decade. In ﬁve
prior matches, Pitt has a 3-2 advantage over-
all, but the Hokies obtained a three-set win
in2003 —— the last meeting between the two
teams. Pitt is also undefeated at home after
two matches against the Hokies. A

The Hokies (13~3,1-1ACC) are coming in
as a strong opponent for the Panthers, after
splitting their ﬁrst two matches of confer-
ence play. The Hokies won 3-1 against Wake
Forest and lost 3-0 to Duke.

The loss to Duke marks the ﬁrst group of
three straight set losses that the Hokies have
endured all season. In their two other losses
—— versus then-No. 14 Michigan State and
Louisville — the Hokies lost both matches
by a score of 3-2.

The Panthers will need to account for
Virginia Tech senior middle blocker Vic-
toria Hamsher, who has had a successful
season with 126 kills and 31 total blocks.

Hamsher was also voted to the preseason
All-ACC Team. .

“Virginia Tech is going tube the best team
we have seen in a couple weeks,” Pitt head
coach Dan Fisher said. “We saw them in the
spring but we’re going to expect them to be
really tough.”

Pitt’s second and ﬁnal match of the week-
end comes against Virginia, which Pitt also
has not faced at home in over a decade. How-
ever, Pitt holds a 1-1 record at home versus
Virginia.

The Cavaliers (8-6, 1-1 ACC) have had ups
and downs throughout the season, start-
ing off strong by winning their ﬁrst three
matches before dropping ﬁve of the next six.
Virginia then went on another three-match
winning streak before starting ACC play, at
which time the team went 1-1.

Virginia lost 3-0 at Duke in their ﬁrst ACC
match but also won 3-0 at Wake Forest. The
Cavaliers’ win at Wake Forest was Virginia’s

3 ﬁrst away win all season and their ﬁrst con-

ference win on the road in almost two years.

The players to watch out for on the Cava-
lier’s_ squad are junior setter/right-side hitter
Torijanowski and freshman outside hitter
Haley Kole. In the last match versustwake

Forest, Janowski served four aces and re-

_ corded a double-double with 14 kills and
11 digs. Kole hit for .300 in the same match 3

and tallied 12 kills.

The Panthers are 6-1 in three-set matches
with their lone loss on Aug. 31 against Idaho
State. Pitt is also 8-0 when it outblocks an
opponent, and the team has served more
aces than’ its opponent in 10 of 15 matches.
The Panthers have 97 service aces so far this
season, and their season best so far was 13
against South Florida on Sept. 13.

Freshman outside hitter »Maria Genit-
saridi looks to remain a key player for the
Panthers. In the match versus Clemson,
Genitsaridi led the team with 10 kills and a
hitting percentage of .562. _

I Meanwhile, junior opposite Kate Yeazel
was once again named the Pitt Athlete of the
Week. This is the second timethis season that
Yeazel has achieved this honor. She tallied 22
kills and hit .349 in thetwo matches against
Clemson and Georgia Tech. In the Georgia
Tech game alone, Yeazel had 14 kills and an

_. incredible attack percentage of .545.

As Fisher said, the competition is tough
this weekend, and Yeazel and the upstart
Panthers are sure to be tested. ﬂ
