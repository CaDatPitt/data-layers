Vol. 64, No. 21

The Advising Center wishes to

{Wpublicize four important academic

opportunities which exist for CAS
students and which have not pre-
viously been sufficiently pub-
licized. The four items with brief
explanations follow.

1. A CAS student may now re-
ceive official recognition for a
double major provided thathe ful-
fills all requirements of both de-
partments involved. Both majors
will appear on the transcript al-
though the diploma will show only
a B.A. or B.S., notboth, if one of
the majors is in Natural Science

» and the other in either Social Sci-

ence or Humanities. Related
areas are not required if a stu-
dents elects a double major. Any
questions should be directed to
Mrs.ARhea Bass, 917 CL, ext. 361.

2. Any CAS student may ‘take
any graduate course (one per

term) with the following-restric

tions :

a. All prerequisites, if any, for
the course. must be met.

‘ b. Prior written permission
from the instructor must be se-
cured.

c. If the course is in a school

Wwoutside Arts and Sciences (i.e.,

;
3

Business, Education, GSPIA,
etc.) written permission from the
dean of that school is also re-
quired. (The credits for any
courses taken outside Arts and
Sciences will be counted toward

Female Revolt.’

CAS Students Offered

Opportunities

graduation as part of the 12 credit
non-CAS maximum. )

3. Any CAS student may design
his own major. After the student
has accumulated T55-60 credits,
the usual time for declaring a ma-
jor, is the official time to present
a proposal to the dean of the Col-
lege. The Advising Center, how-
ever, encourages all students in-
terested in such a program to
think about and prepare for such a
possibility much earlier in their
academic careers. A summary of
requirements and procedures for
self-designed majors is available

in the dean's office, 917 CL (see

Mrs. Rhea Bass) or in the Advis-
ing Center, 909 CL (see Fred Fo-
loc) . The Advising Center also has
a file containing possible topics
and issues around which a self-de-
signed major might be structured,
as well as previously approved
programs.

4. All seniors and juniors, and,

in certain special cases, sopho-
more, are eligible to take one

course per term at another co1— .

lege or university in Pittsburgh
under the Cross College and Uni-
versity Registration program,
sponsored by the Pittsburgh Coun-
cil on Higher Education. Lists of
the approved courses available at
each institution, as well as neces-
sary forms and directions for reg-
istration are available from either
Miss Mary Jane Birkhaus in the
Dean’s Office. 917 CL (ext. 377),
or Fred Koloc, 909 CL (ext. 296).

Addresses "A narchists”

by ANNE DORN
Staff Writer

About 30 years separate the age
and the ideas of Sydney Lens. co-
chairman of the New Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Viet-

nam. Lens is an older man. but

his ideas are radically young. Lens
was in town to address an audi-
ence of “fellow professional ana-
archists" Friday evening at Car-
negie-Mellon University.

Before he delved into his pre-
pared topic, he attempted to put
the audience’s mind at ease about
the rumored violence in Washing-
ton on Nov. 15, and about the Jus-

tice Department’s recent refusal I

to grant a permit for more than
50,000 marchers. He accused the
government of "redbaiting and
violence baiting” in its refusal of
the permit. “I don't give a damn
about the Weathermen,” he cried.
“I give a damn about a murderer
in the White House called Richard
Nixon.”

But in spite of all the trouble
the government may be causing,
said Lens, "Nixon has helped the
liberals get together again.
They’re rising to our defense.
Even Senator Scott from Pennsyl-
vania has called Sam Brown from
the Moratorium Committee to in-
tervene in our behalf.” (Editor's
Note: The Moratorium Committee
and the New Mobilization Commit-
tee are separate, but coordinating
their efforts in Washington. The
Mobilization Committee is an or-
ganization of over 100 peace

taries, other employees.

On Monday, Nov. 17, from 12 noon to 2 p.m.
and 5 to_6 p.m., in the Supper Room of the Stu-
dent Union, the University of Pittsburgh Com-
. mittee for Women’s Rights, of the Pittsburgh
mWomen’s Liberation, is holding a Grievance
5 1 Meeting for the women of the University Com-

munity.

The purpose of this meeting is to collect

specific details of women’s experiences of sex

discrimination within the University of Pitts-
burgh. All information will be kept confidential
at the request of the person submitting it. This

information will be used to establish grievance
procedures and to redress any unlawful prac-

tice.

For years women have been unhappy about
their treatment -at the University. The admin-
istration and faculty consist almost exclusive-
ly of males. The University’s current practices

are largely male centered and are often ad-
versely discriminatory-toward women. We

know that discrimination exists in many areas,
ranging from admissions practices, student
financial support, and classroom treatment of
women, to hiring procedures, salaries, and
promotions- The Committee for Women’s
Rights needs information about individual ex-

. periences of discrimination in the University.

Len’s tone became more vehe-
ment as he spoke about violent
demonstration. “We want to con-
vince fellow Americans that this
is a rotten,» lousy, illegal war that

   
   

 

"H ave no fear

nounced. He noted that plans call
for 3,000-6,000 marshals, and 600
legal marshals. ‘‘If the govern-
ment lets us, this will be the big-
gest protest in American history,
and the most non-violent.”

He then moved into a teach-in- i

like «discussion about Nixon, the
war, American society, and the
responsibility of youth. “Consider-
ing the state of the country to-
day,” he began, “I was waiting for
an historic speech the other night
when President Nixon spoke. But

land?” was one of the questions
harried Lindsay workers answer-
ed patiently the first day or two
when a lost Pittsburgher would
telephone headquarters. By elec-
tion day, most of the students had
become familiar enough with sub-
way language and directions to di-
rect Manhattan volunteers to the
Brooklyn headquarters. The “side
trips” to the Village and even the
mistaken visits to Coney Island
paid off. ‘

Not too many of the students
had previous campaign experience
and Brooklyn proved to be an ex-
citing political workshop. District
maps at the headquarters and ac-
tual door—to-door canvassing en-
able the studentsto become fami-
liar »with both the neighborhoods
and the voters of Brooklyn. By
working with ward chairmen and
experienced Lindsay workers, the
students were able to develop a
better understanding of political
campaign activities.

On election day, those who qual-
ified and even some who did not
were assigned as poll watchers in
an election district. Because no
third party had challenged the
Democratic or Republican ma-
chinery in New York by sending
watchers to the polls in recent
years, those who poll watched
faced open hostility from elec-
tion board officials in ethnic dis-
tricts that opposed Lindsay. Even
with a copy of the election laws and
the assistance of a visiting deputy
attorney, watchers for Lindsay’s
Independent-Liberal Party were
challenged and ridiculed as
“smart aleck” kids sent in to
make trouble. In some districts,
the police officers w_ho were on
duty to insure fairness for all par-
ties were blatantly hostile and of
little or no assistance.

( This is the first in a two-part
series concerning the New York
mayorality election.)

  Curriculum Revised

Kids are beautiful people.

They are naturally honest, sincere,
and curious.

They want to learn.

They find so much of interest to ex-
plore. .

And what does the existing school
system do with (or to) this vast
potential?

Schools destroy the great intel-
lectual and creative capacity of
children. Teachers within the pre-
sent system continue transmitting

. neatly packaged answers, instead

of helping kids askquestions rele-
vant to the solution of problems.
Teachers rob children of the re-
sponsibility to decide what is
worth doing, instead of encourag-
ing children to make real deci-
sions. 'I‘oo many teachers in the
elementary schools fail to be re-
sponsive to the changing needs of
the individual child.

Clearly, fundamental changes
are needed in the elementary

‘school system. If schools are to be

a place where each child. in his
own way, ca-n satisfy his curiosi-
ty, then a radically different kind
of “teacher will be needed to fa-
cilitate learning_. As teacher train-
ers, the University plays a crucial
role in the direction of change. ‘

Recognizing that the process of
preparing teachers needs change,
the Elementary Education De-
partment is totally revising it’s
undergraduate curriculum. Many
people of the University commun-
ity are now involved, including ad-
ministrators of elementary
schools in the surrounding areas.

She asked, “Mother, how do
you know that’s what God
wants?” And her mother
said, “I don’t know for sure.
And I don’t think anyone
does. But as we learn more.
and more, we ﬁnd that every
man everywhere, religious
or not, rich or poor, good or‘
bad, has a part of the truth
in him.” So Alice’s daughter

the truth is constantly being

Instead of sitting in front of the
television set and dreaming he’s
Joe Namath, George Plimpton
does something about his mascu-
line, aggressive nature. He plays
with the pros, takes physical beat-
ings on the field, and suffers men-
tal embarrassment each time, as
he fails to match their standards,
though not by much. Then, he
writes brilliantly of his first-hand
experiences. Authenticity is his
greatest achievement.

He can’t really pitch to pro base-
ball All-Stars, he can’t remember
the plays during a pro scrimmage,

A ’ he can’t even win a chess game

with a pro opponent . . . but the
important thing is, he tries. And
that’s what makes him such a
fantastic sports writer. He’s been
there. Plimpton will speak here
on Tuesday at 12 noon in the Stu—
dent Union Ballroom, under the
sponsorship of the Student Union
Public Affairs Committee.

It’s not enough that he’s had his
nose bloodied by three rounds
with Archie Moore, completely
botched an appearance with the
Detroit Lions, made an appear-

ance“with the New York Sym-V

phony, entered a hockey game
with the Detroit Red Wings . . . all
that is not enough. He still yearns

  . to fight a bull.

ing community support.

Dear Friend:

On Oct. 15, this country witnessed the

}large_st demonstration of anti-war senti-
*ment in its history. The numbers involved"
= were impressive, but equally impressive

-was the range of those participating. Sub-

'‘ -stantial advances were made in commun-
:ities. For the first time, in addition to
‘ .-massive student support,‘ large numbers

of business and professional men, house-

V "wives, ‘and working people demonstrated

their opposition to, and impatience with,

the Vietnam war. Public opinion has

clearly shifted and this shift must be fol-
lowed up by closer relationship between
the university community and the larger
community. . .

The second series of activities of the
Vietnam Moratorium is scheduled for
Nov. 13 and 14. On these dates universi-

ties and local communities around the

country will be continuing the effort
which got off to such a tremendous start
in October. During these two days, in

. view of the support and interest evi-

denced within the communities, it is cer-
tain that many people will be concentrat-
ing heavily on solidifying and broaden-

On Nov. 13 and 14 as well, the New
Mobilization Committee -to ‘End the War
in Vietnam is sponsoring a “March
Against Death—a Vietnam Memorial.”
Many supporters of the Moratorium will
be participating in this solemn event. In
many local communities, plans are being
made to hold memorial services and read-
ing of the war dead vigils to coincide with
the Washington activity. ‘ O

The New Mobilization is also sponsor-

. ing a peaceful and legal Mass March and

Rally in Washington,‘ D. C., on Nov. 15.

' The four co-ordinators of the Vietnam

Moratorium Committee, as well as many
Moratorium supporters from around the
country, plan to join this march. We will
provide support for local Moratorium
groups who will be coming to Washington
and encourage others to participate in
the March on Washington.

Peace.
The Vietnam
Moratorium Committee

MEMO——

The Moratorium Days for November
are the 13th and 14th. Our emphasis on
those days will be concentrated on com-

vmunity organizing. With the great suc-

cess of Oct. 15, is not likely that the num-
bers who participated in mass rallies
across the country would be equaled.
Rather than compete with our past rec-
ord, reports from local communities
across the country indicate that the effort
will focus on solidifying the support which
was stimulated by the Oct. 15 Moratori-
um.

The activities planned for Nov. 13
and 14 generally fall into fice categories:

A. Sign for Peace postcard campaign;
B. Canvassing and leafletting opera-

’ tions;,

C. Solidification of special interest

‘ group support (i.e. businessmen, labor,

and professionals), and

D. Symbolic sympathy actions and
state capital marches to coincide with
“The March Against Death—a Vietnam
Memorial.” »

Vietnam Moratorium: Nov. 13, 14 

Important points to remember in or-
ganizinga canvassing operation:

1. Make sure all registered voters are.
approached—secure a list of registered
voters from city hall.

2. Prepare a canvassing kit containing
the following:

a. Details of the route and a street
map.

b. A selection of literature concentrat-
ing on the relation of the war to inflation
and taxes, the continuing loss of life, the
distortion of national priorities, and the
inadequacy of either a partial ceasefire
or token troop withdrawals (we will be
sending out samples of such material
_during the week ).

c. A supply of materials such as but-.
tons and bumper stickers, a note-book or
3 x 5 index cards on which a record of
each visit, name. address, and extent of
interest should be recorded.

3. Where possible try to have local
residents canvastheir own areas.

1.1Circulate endorsing petitions call-
ing for immediate withdrawal which can
then be forwarded to their national lead-
ership.

2. Join the Sign for Peace postcard
campaign. L

3. Sponsor signed newspaper ads.

4. Purchase radio spots to express
their opposition to the war.

5. Hold block parties, cocktail parties,

, and Koffee Klatches, invite student speak-
~..ers, discuss the issue, raise funds for

the local and national committee.

6. Demonstrate symbolic support by
wearing black arm-bands. attending
church memorial services, and closing
their business for some part of the day in

"order toiparticipatein activities related

to the Moratorium.

When dealing with all these groups, it
is important to remember that a large
number of these constituents are rela-
tively new to the peace movement. Care
should be taken when approaching these’

4. Assign each section of the canvas
to a group or a specific individual who is
responsible for covering and keeping rec-
ords of certain area.

5. It is essential that a briefing sessioii
be held before any canvassing effort in
which general approach. format. and con-
tent is discussed and practiced.

Leafletting
Planning should begin now to set up
and schedule leafletting operations.

Be sure and cover:

1. Commuter trains;

2. Buses at peak commuting hours:

3. Traffic jams at rush—hour;

4. Airports;

5. Factories during shift changes. and
6. Shopping and business areas.

C. Special Interest Grous

Lawyers. doctors. teachers. and un-
ion men should be contacted. Encourage
these groups to:

potentially powerful support groups.
Rhetoric. tone. and general presentation
may be the critical factors which deter-
mine support. and should be carefully
considered. The educational thrust of No-
vember should be emphasized. participa-
tion in sympathy actions should be en-
couraged. and the inclusion of the lead-
ers of these groups in decision making is
recommended where possible.

Particularly important among these
support groups are local labor unions.
When dealing with them. all the above
points should be closely observed. The
following are some of the major national
unions that have endorsed the Vietnam
Moratorium: 2

D.;.gSymbolic Sympathy Actions

1. November the 13th is emerging as a
day concentrated on local activity stress-
ing the economic effects of the war-its
role in the trend of inflation, the rise in

"consumer prices. and the increasingly
. 1 ‘high interest rates. ‘

2. Friday. the 14th, can be used to
continue the local activities and. also as a
day of symbolic and support aCt1VltleSf0F
the Washington actions.

a. Encourage local churches to hold
memorial services that day. and to stay
open for 24 hours.

b. Symbolic marches to state capitals
to hold vigils for the war dead of that
state, are still very much in order.

c. Do not try to compete with Oct. 15
in terms of numbers. .

II. General Organizing Ideas

A. Englarge on the contacts already
made in October. Those who participated
as individuals and who are alos members
of civic clubs, or. social groups should in-
form and invoive their menus and mem-
bers. Film programs, seminars, symposi-
iums, debates, and speakers from the
academic and student community, should
be promoted in the weeks preceeding
Nov. 13 and 14.

B. Continuing programs should be
planned on the campus:

1. Information should be available in
central locations.

2; Special sections can be set up in
school, college, and public libraries.

Teams of people should go into each

dorm to discuss the war and to distribute

literature to every student.

4. The campus should become _a forum
for high school students——special area or
state-wide conferences witha series of
workshops, seminars, and speakers are
effective means to reach this important
segment of the community.

C. Campuses should consider the idea
of circulating petitions emphasizing three
ideas (1) Opposition to the war; (25 De-
mand for immediate withdrawal, and '(3)
Refusal to work for any candidate who
does not support and‘ work for the fastest
possible extrication from Vietnam.

D. Fund Raising

1. Plan concerts, social events, and
film programs to raise money and to keep

g up interest.

2. Encourage informal gatherings
in someone’s living room, making sure
that there is a good supply of literature

and an articulate speaker—the host and.

hostess may be asked to provide both
their home and refreshments as their
contribution. 1

Community Peace Fairs—held in a
central locale with a schedule or enter-
tainment and speakers—in addition to
raising money, such an activity is a good
means of annoucing the November plans
to the community.

a. Local groups set up information and
literature booths;

b. Pins, bumper stickers, posters, and
any locally produced crafts can be sold;

c. Local talent as well as campus
theatrical ‘and singing groups can per-
form.

E. Media

As soon as the schedule of events has
been determined, these should be an-
nounced to the local press.

1. Make clear at this time the central
thrust of both the campus and commun-
ity effort.

2. Again, the local media should be
made aware that in most communities
the concerns of Nov. 13 and 14 lie primari-
ly in local organizing and they therefore
should not be looking for thexkind of mas-
sive rallies and marches which were so
strongly in evidence last month.

F. A visual sign of activity which can
be easily made and seasonally appropri-
ate is the annual Halloween pumpkin
carved in a peace symbol instead of the
traditional grin.

G. These are all suggestions. If you
have others which you feel could be effec-
tively carried out. please forward them

glad he chose Ford Motor Company?

 

“You retain your individuality.’
says Chuck Carpenter, a Busi-

“because people know each other
here.”

An extraordinary example? Not
at Ford Motor Company. Chuck
wasn’t even sure where he'd fit
in the automobile industry when
he started in 1968. “Now, I know
where I’m going. It tookabout a
year to get a solid business back-
ground. I’m doing what I like best
—meeting with people, analyzing
their problems, finding solutions.
And it looks like l’ll reach my

"You don’t get lost in te numbers.”

much sooner than I expected."

What about Chuck’s rapid ad-
vancement? “Not everyone can
go as far as fast,” he admits. “it
depends on how much of your-
self you put into your job.I’ Nat-
urally, Chuck’s wholehearted in-
terest got noticed at Ford Motor

Panthers Collapse After 6
Good Start, Lose 49-7

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor
A machine rolled into the stadium Saturday and it was in no
hurry to leave as the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame ruined the

Panther Homecoming, 49-7.

A powerful Irish running attack, complemented by a 9-for-11
passing effort by quarterback Joe Theismann, led Panther coach
Carl DePasqua to the conclusion that his squad wasn’t beaten by

an ordinary team.

“They had such an extremely
fine blocking line,” DePasqua
said. “They were gaining five or
six yards on running plays. Their

’ backs run hard and you have to

stick them or they’ll run out of
your arms.

“They operated strictly like a
machine. I’d say that they’re the
best team. I’ve seen in a long
time.” '

fTAII.BACK DENNY FERRIS found little running room Saturday as the tough Irish defense held the Panther
group game to 66 yards total. Ferris accounted for 41 of the 66 yards, while fullback Tony Esposito was held
to 23 yards in seven carries.- The game marked the first time this season that Esposito gained less than 50

yards.

In the two preceding contests.

compared to the rivals’ four.
Coach Leo Bemis’ men could fig-

ure no reason why the bombard-
g ment would be snuffed out.

C-MU had lost to Slippery Rock

and Grove City; the booters had
virtually no difficulty with either

‘ A opponent. However. after the first

half at the C-MU football stadium

"the booters were completely

xlanked.

‘The only score of the day came
1' when Gus Theofillis shot the ball
.into the nets early in the third
quarter. Theofilis received a head
pass from Dave DiEmidio about
25 feet in front of the goal. He
drove straight ahead and belted
the ball in from eight feet out.

‘ . \

Throughout the contest the boot-
ers had many more opportunities
but somehow continued missing
by the width of a hair. Total shots
on goal told the story: booters 24,
C-MU 6. Lineman John White,
alone, had six boots banged down
at the C-MU net.

At least two booter goals seem-
ed as inevitable as life and death.
Late in the third period, Chucho
Valencia dribbled toward the goal
from the right side unmolested
by the sight of any Tartan war
riors. Suddenly. he whipped his
leg into the ball. Unbelievably.
though, his 12 foot shot eluded
the nets vacant left corner by
several feet.

Chucko later pointed to where
he struck the ball. “My foot did
not hit the ball,” he said as he
glanced at his shin. “I should’ve
made it,” he murmured weakly.

Then, with ‘just seven minutes
remaining in the game John White

accepted a pass and streaked
ahead of the C-MU defensemen.
In a sudden flash, White delivered
a bulleting smash which appeared
to be the second goal of the day.
Nevertheless, the opposing goalie
stood as a one-man blockage and
halted the enemy strike. The
goalie could not handle the force-
ful shot, but grabbed the rebound
off his body.

One cause for the scarcity of
goals was the narrow width of the
C-MU field. According to Bemis.
the passing attack suffered tre-
mendously.

“Everything’s (most passes)
out of bounds. That's what hap-
pens when you’re playing on a
football field. There was no room
to go up the middle; we had to use
our wings more,” Bemis remark-
ed.

The booters next meet Penn St.
Nov. 22 in the season’s final at
University Park. V

 

The Irish appeared to want to
stay around longer than most of
the fans. Despite the six touch-
down advantage Ara Parseghian’s
gridders called three time outs in

the waning seconds of the encoun- I

ter, while the customers’ march-
ed to the exits—-which began early
in the second half—-was being com-
pleted.

The Irish drive ended on the
Panther 14-yard-line as time ran
out, but better than half of the 44,-
084 football buffs attending the
game didn’t seem to care—they
were gone.

Those who left after the first
half didn’t‘miss much. The Irish
simply added a couple of scores
on an 18-yard run by Denny Allen
and a 26-yard jaunt by reserve
quarterback Bill Etter, giving
their 35-7 halftime lead a cushion.

The Panthers failed to score in

the second half, once again. They
didn’t even reach the scoreboard

‘ in the second quarter this week.

In fact, the Jungle Cat offense
seemed to play dead against the
strong Irish‘ defense. Led at times

managed no first downs in the sec-
ond period and only four in the fin-

There was only one penetration

three quarters of the game. That
movement was to the N otre Dame
41-yard-line late in the third stan-
za. On the next play Gustine was
chased back to th_e Irish 47.

Afther that, the game turned
into a punting duel between two
second string punters.

JE THEISMANN
Outstanding Player

With neither team going any-
where, Jim Yoder punted three
times for the Irish and Dave Mc-
Grath punted four times for the
Jungle Cats. The only sustained
drive was the one that was halted
by the clock.

McGrath replaced Joe Spicko as
the Panther punter because of a
knee injury to the regular kicking
specialist. His performance (a
36-yard average on seven punts)
was one of the few pleasantries
for DePasqua.

“Well, for Dave”s first time
punting in a college game, I think
he did an extremely fine job un-
der pressure,” the Cat mentor
said. “At least he was able to get
them off; he had none blocked.”

For awhile it looked like De-
Pasqua could smile about more
than simply getting punts away.

The Irish grabbed 'a quick’
touchdown at the beginning of the
game, but the Panthers discover-
ed that they could move the pig-
skin against the Fighting Irish.
The Cats marched 67» yards be-
fore an incompletion stopped their
first firstdrive on the Irish five-
yard-line.

Parseghian’s young offense
easily moved 95 yards to a 14-0
lead, but the Jungle Cats fought
back again. This time they made
the first downs count by going all
the way. Friedl tossed a six yard
pass to Steve Moyer for the score.

It was more than a TD for
Friedl. The completion gave him
ten touchdown aerials this fall,
equalling Kenny Lucas’ Panther
mark.

That was the end of the joy for
the Cats, though. A miracle would
not be performed against Notre
Dame.

Theismann three a couple TD
passes in the second quarter, giv-
ing him three on the day. His per-
formance also netted thelrish 126
yards through the air and won the
outstaning player award for the
quarterback.

He only played two or three
minutes in the final half before
being replaced by Etter. By then.
the Irish were so far in front that
they only tried four passes the
rest of the way. It really didn’t
matter, but all four attempts miss-
ed their targets.

PSU Outruns Harriers
Despite Win By Richey

by JERRY MYERS

Contrary to popular predic-.

tions and most optimistic eval-
uations, Penn State trampled
all over the distancemen, by a lop-
sided score of 23-38, Saturday
at University Park.

Succumbing to a relatively
weaker team, the Panthers start-

GREG ROGERS
Finishes Fourth

ed off well but then collapsed. Jer-
ry Richey continued his winning
ways, with a first place finish. but
other than Richey, only Greg Ro-
gers managed to score.

Greg who had been sick all week
with a virus, turned in a valiant
performance, prompting coach
Jim Banner to comment, "We
were terrible, all except Greg who
did a great job.” Rogers didn’t
practice at all while he was sick.

Another casualty cost the.har-
riers dearly. Dave Cheseborough,
who has been out for a couple
weeks with a bad achilles tendon,
attempted to return to action on
Saturday, but he just didn’t have
it. “Dave gave it a good try, but he
couldn’t come through.” Dave
hasn't been practicing with the
squad either.

Jerry Richey’s finish provided
the brightest spot in an otherwise
dull, dismal afternoon. The weath-
er was overcast and the running
conditions weren’t the best. Rich-
ey‘s time of 25:16 was tremen-
dous considering the conditions
and Banner said, “Jerry would
have broken the course record if
it hadn’t been such a bad day.

“I don’t mind 1osing.” Banner
continued, “but we were the bet-
ter‘ team; When we’re the better
team it makes it much worse.”
The loss is a big letdown to a team
that has really progressed from a
unheralded beginning. Now they
face the two big tournaments with
a 7-1 record.

The race started out very even
but slowly the Penn State runners
gained the lead and kept it. “We
let them get ahead of us and then
we couldn’t catch up.” Banner
was very disappointed with the

barriers’ performance. He attri-
buted it more to over-confidence,
then lack of confidence. He was
very impressed with the running
of Greg Rogers, but he lashed out
at the rest of the squad for their
sub-par performance.

The course itself was familiar
to Banner and he felt that location
played no part in the race. The
weather conditions were not con-
ducive to a fast race, but both
teams were plagued with the
same drawbacks. As it was, Rich-
ey’s time was only 12.8 seconds
slower than the course record of
25:03.2, set last year by Villa-
nova’s Tom Donnelly.

The regualr season has now
come to a close for the harriers.
but the post-season tournaments
still remain. Coach Banner, in all
probability, will send a large con-
tingent of his distancemen to bat-
tle in the championships. The
Easterns are on tap for Nov. 17.

Early Sunday morning, not a peeper (not even a quack)

could be heard in all of Oakland. Then, thrusting through the «

bleak Sunday silence came a crude harsh blend of rhythmic

song.

Dave “GI” Tiernan and Jerry “Leroy” Gruebel waddled
down Fifth Ave., joined hand and slobbered, “We’ve got more

soul.” GI looked at Leroy. Leroy
just rolled his eyes and grinned.
You see, Leroy had just received
a congratulatory telegram from

“Ever since I wuz a wittle boy,

worked and we send them home nice
as new. Because we don't just wash
them clean. We wash them fresh air
clean. And we don't iron some parts

Textbooks for the Fall Trimester will be re-
moved from the Book Center shelves on Novem-
ber 12th, 1969 to make room for the incoming
Winter Trimester Books. The early date is re-
quired because of the large increase in texts

  which does not give the Book Center sufficient
time to make complete change in the short se-
mester break.
