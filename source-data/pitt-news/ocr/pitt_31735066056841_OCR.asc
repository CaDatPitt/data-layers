voice input
regarding
Law dean
selection

By Jennifer Vernet
For T be Pitt News

Pitt law students voiced their opin-
ions about the search for a dean
of the University of P-.ittsburgh’s
Law School last Tluirsday at a pub-
lic fomm designed to break the com-
munication barriers between the
selection committee and the stu-
dents. A

“This public forum/is one opportu-
nity for the students to voice ques-
tions and opinions about the dean
search,” Randy Juhl, dean of the
School of Pharmacy and committee
chairperson, said.

.“It’s important that the committee
knows what the students want," he
said.

" After a failed dean search last year,
the six-member committee is in
the early stages of the search to
"replace former dean, Mark A.
Nordenberg, and has just begun to
solicit nominations from other uni-
versities as well as the Pitt Law
School faculty.

“We-are looking for someone who
is a national1y—known leader, who
has a record of accomplishments,
has scholarship in a university setting
and can lead from the front and from
behind,” Juhl said.

- “Basically, we’re looking for some-
one who can walk on water,” he
said. , ’

Pitt law students had some ideas of
their own.

Pitt physics professor chosen to lead national committee

technical barriers to the semi-

By Travis Senseny
For The Pitt News

A University of Pittsburgh
research professor of physics,

Wolfgang J. Choyke, will chair a -

national committee that will
evaluate a new group of heat
resistant materials which could
revolutionize the "electronics
industry.

l Choyke was chosen as chair-
person of the Committee on
Materials for High Temperature

Semiconductor Devices because V

he has been working with sili-
con carbide (a particularly inter-
esting semiconductor) since
1955. .

He said, “I have been a
contributor to the field for a
long time. I know everyone in
the world who works in this
area.” S

"The 10-member committee
was organized by the. National
Research . Council of the
National Academy of Sciences.

‘It will study the potential‘ of

high-temperature semiconduc-
tors.

Semiconductors are very light,
are durable and can resist
extremely high temperatures,
according to Choyke.

The semiconductors tp be
evaluated are: silicon carbide,
aluminum ‘nitride, galium
nitride, _aluminum galium

nitride, diamond and boron,

nitrides.

Choyke said that these materi-
als were chosen to be evaluated
“because of [their] excellent
thermal conductivity.”

“We will be able to make
equipment which will be much
lighter with the same power

requirements,’? he -said.
The committee will consist of
researchers from the University

A of California, Massachusetts

Institute of Technology, AT&T
Bell Laboratories and the Ford

Motor Companies among oth— _
.ers. "

“Pitt is an important player in
the more fundamental aspects

of studying these materials,” ‘

Choyke said. _

Choyke came to Pittsburgh to
work for Westinghouse in 1952
after getting his Ph.D. from
Ohio State University.

Choyke became an adjunct
professor of physics at
the University of Pittsburgh in
1973.

He retired from Westinghouse
in 1988 to become a research‘
professor of physics at Pitt.

Applications of the new semi-

conductorsgcould include the
improvement of automobile

engines, spacecraft construc— .

tion, nuclear reactor control and
sensing systems, more efficient
radar systems and aircraft avion-
ics.

The semiconductors could
lead to the development of
lightweight non—meta1lic power
systems. .

Choyke said, “One day these
[semiconductors] will be an
important player in the automo-
tive industry. 'In addition, it is
likely that these will be useful in
high‘ radiation and space envi-
ronments.”

The committee will assess

national and international
research efforts ‘dealing with
high temperature semiconduc-
tors.

They will then identify the

conductors’ development and
manufacture. _

The committee will also try to
determine the necessary criteria
for integrating the new semi-
conductors into currently exist-
ing systems, and they will rec-
ommend future research priori-
ties.

Finally the committee will
suggest new applications
and advantages of semiconduc-
tors. A

When the committee con— ,

cludes its study, its report will
be referred and approved by
the National Materials Advisory
Board.

A final report will be pub-

» lished and issued to federal

agencies.
The report will then become a
public document.

The ‘newest members of the
Pitt Greek system brought their
enthusiasm and excitement to
this year’s Greek 101 Presents:
Hats off to Being Greek at
David Lawrence Auditorium
Sunday.

“This is the first time we’ve
done it like this, “ program co-
coordinator Julie Holaren, refer--

ring to the system’s new one-»
day format, said. I

“The day is going wonderful-
ly.”
Greek 101 was designed to
educate the Greek pledges and
associate members about Greek
ethics and Greek life at Pitt,
according to Inter-Fraternity
Council Secretary Eric Scerbo.

“We introduce [the pledges] to
some of the general concepts of
member education,” Scerbo
said.

Greek issues were discussed
in facilitating sessions and

addressed by three guest speak-
ers.

Dr. Robyn Sawyer, professor
of human sexuality at the
University of Maryland, spoke
about the topic of date rape and
how it is often a result of com-
munication problems.

“[Sawyer] was great,” Pitt
sophomore Beth Levine said. “I
would recommend him to
speak to anybody about this
topic.”

A member of the National IFC_

Commission on Values and
Ethics, George Spasic, spoke to
the audience about Greek ethics
and the current situation of
America’s fraternities and sorori-
ties.

“There has been somewhat of
an erosion of standards,” Spasic
said. “Particularly in accepting
responsibility for our actions.

“We want to try and get frater-
nities back to the basics,” Spasic
said. '

The height of the enthusiasm

came when Pitt head football"

coach Johnny Majors received
two standing ovations from the
crowd.

Majors spoke on his Greek
experiences in college, and he
commended the Pitt Greeks for
their support of the university
and the football team.

“I think it’s important to have
Coach Majors supportive of the
Greek system,” sophomore
pledge Chad Rhine said. “He
has alot of energy which he
brought to us today.”

“Some of our best support
comes from the Greeks,”
Majors said.

“But it takes a combination of
them and others.” .

Greek 101 is in its third year
of existence. In past years the
program consisted of short ses-
sions every week, but this year
it all takes place in one day,
according to Scerbo.

“Greek 101 had a bad reputa-
tion of being a drag,” said
Holaren. A

— “This year I think we’re

     .   _        
Gree/e 10]  “emphasizes   responsibility, . team spirit

accomplishing as much if not
more than the old program.”

“I think it’s a much better pro-
gram like this,” program co-
coordinator Brian Lockner said.
“I think we’ve doubled our
attendance, and the members
seem to enjoy it better.”

Lockner also said that the pro-
gram promotes Greek unity and
provides an opportunity for
pledges to meet fellow pledges. _

“This is a good way for the
fraternities and sororities to
interact,” Rhine said.

“The whole Greek system is
united.”

“We feel that they are all in
 the
‘Holaren said.

same position now,”

“We are all Greeks, and we
are all confronted with the same
issues.”

In accordance with their poli-
cy of community service, the
coordinators of the event donat-
ed the extra 25 pizzas from
lunch and some_t—shirts to the
Jubilee Kitchen.

About two dozen women from several
of Pitt’s graduate and professional
schools gathered Friday to discuss
women’s issues," create networking and
support systems and meet women out-
side their individual schools.

The agenda at the first Graduate and

Professional Women’s Association meet-

ing was lightbecause the organizers of
the meeting wanted to give women the
opportunity to build the organization
into something to fit their individual
needs and concerns, said graduate stu-

dent Jenna Ferrara,’ who is helping to get.

the organization on its feet.

The women sat in a circle and said

why they decided to attend and what

they hope to gain from the GPWA.

Shannon Moe, a graduate student who
just moved to Pittsburgh from Tucson,
said she came “mostly to see what other
graduate women are Concerned with and
to see how other women handle moving
to a new place and starting a new pro-
gram.” '

“The. biggest part of why I want’ to
come is just to meet other women on
campus that I wouldn’t get to meet oth-
erwise,” graduate student Janet Stocks
said.

Ferrara said graduate women run into
so many of the same problems in all dis-
ciplines across campus, and she hopes

  Women ’5 group aims to create graaaate staaem‘ network

through this organization that women
can “work together to achieve common
goals.”

“It’s hard to meet other women .
there are so many of us, and we’re all
united against common problems,”
Ferrara said.

. Workshops and speakers on various
topics, such as personal safety, were also

discussed. Committees will be set up to’

organize such activities in the future.

The GPWA said it is not intended" to be
a politically active group. “But it should
be a group that can speak for a graduate
professional woman if the need arises,”
said Lori Short, who got the idea for a
women’s association when she had trou-
ble finding child care at Pitta few years

if

ago.

“Women can get things done. We just
have to unite to do it,” Stocks said, who
couldn’t find a sitter and had to bring her
daughter to the meeting.

In order to get recognized as an offi-
cial organization and have a budget, the
GBWA has to devise a constitution and
elect officers. Ferrara said the group
would like to network with the women’s

center at Carnegie Mellon University to

get ideas and support.

It is also considering trying to become
an assembly group under the Graduate
and Professional Student Association and
have access to their budget. It is aiming
to be officially recognized by next
semester.

- When Curtis Smith is done
patrolling the streets and build-
ings on the University of
Pittsburgh campus, he can be

found teaching others how to

defend themselves and be safe,
too.

Smith teaches youngsters, stu-
dents, faculty and others the
“Buy Yourself A Minute”
(BYAM) method of personal
protection. It’s a method he
devised where a person can
become Streetwise, understand
and know more about them_—
selves, about an area, about
crime itself and how to protect
themselves with what they
have. ’

“People are misled -and don’t
understand the true philosophy
of defense, and I want to simpli-
fy that with answers students
are looking for,” Curtis Smith
said.

After graduating from Pitt in
1976 with a degree in social sci-

ences, Smith focused on martial

arts. With his “determination to
achieve,” he accumulated over
400 trophies and was named the
competitor of the year by the

Kwam Mu Kwam Federation
during the 1977-78 season.
Smith was also a member of the
winning AAU Tae Kwon Do
national team in 1977.

Smith extended his talents by
being the first self—defense
instructor at Carnegie Mellon
University between 1978-79.
Later he taught at the
Community College of
Allegheny County, La Roche
College, Chatham College and
the University of Pittsburgh.

“When people want to learn
how to protect themselves,
they’re wanting to learn to fight
 but the best defense weapon
that I teach and have people
use is their mouth  talking,”
Smith said. “Talking is still one
of your best means of defense.

“Defense should be the last
resort, not the first,” Smith
stressed.

Smith has a fourth degree
black belt in both karate and
jujitsu and is a master level
instructor in the martial arts
field. He is the founder of

team that performs in the

Those who live outside the
scope of the current Pitt trans-
portation system may soon
have two options for getting
to Pitt cheaper and easier.

According to Student
Government Board President
Jacob Brody at Friday’s meet-
ing, discounts on’ Port

and refunds for those who

being investigated by the SGB
and the Office . of
Transportation and Parking.

dents have used our trans-
portation system already this
semester and that’s great,”
Brody said. “But we have had
problems with people riding
the buses who shouldn’t be.”
Brody said people living
beyond Squirrel Hill have dri-
ven to Squirrel Hill and rode
the Pitt buses from there. He
said the Office of
Transportation and Parking is
looking for ways to help dri-
vers because the bus system
cannot be extended much fur-

“More than 100,000 stu-'

SGB looking into PAT

“One idea is to give a five-
dollar discount on parking
permits for every rider in the
car,” Brody said.

“It is not easy to add Pitt
bus aoutes because we come
into conflict with PAT, but
hopefully we can work out a
deal where Pitt can subsidize
PAT in retum for student dis-
counts.”

Brody also reported that Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor told the Senate
Council that he will not
approve a compensation pro-
posal until the staff and stu-
dent positions are given.
Brody said he and board
member Ted Schroeder are
assessing student opinions.

“I don’t have a problem
with giving raises to faculty
who do a satisfactory job,”
Brody said.

“But I think the proposal
may also include some raises
for those whose performance
is below satisfactory. My feel-
ing is that you can’t give a

- raise to everybody.

“For every percent that fac-
ulty compensation is raised, it
means a 2 percent tuition

discounts

increase. In light of how
much tuition is increasing
already, I think that this must
be examined very seriously.”

New Elections Chairperson
Deborah Ryan announced
that on Tuesday, Oct. 5, an
information session will be
heldfor those interested in
running for SGB.

“It will help candidates
learn about the constitution
and bylaws of SGB,” Brody
said.

“By attending this session,
candidates can prevent run-
ning on platforms that are
beyond the scope of Pitt’s
SGB.” .
A motion was passed to
reinstate an SGB voting booth
in Benedum Hall, and a rein-
statement of the Victoria
Building booth is being"'con—
sidered for the next meeting.

Pitt cbamges logo for
at more collegiate look

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer ‘

Quietly, Pitt’s school seal has
changed on every computer,
every piece of paper and every
vehicle on campus.

“It was changed to bring it
into line with the collegiate feel-
ing of the university, from what
was more of a corporate feel,”
said Vicki Mauclair of University
Relations.

The old seal consisted of a
shield with William Pitt’s crest in
a circle and has been around
since 1974.

“The seal is the most popular
item at the bookstore, and the
old seal was just not as progres-
sive as it could have been,” said
Cynthia Gill, director of publica-
tions.

“In 1989 a task force was
formed to determine how much
a new logo would cost, but [the
task force] was disbanded
because of the money. Typically
a job of this nature costs around
$50,000 and up,” said Gill.

What finally motivated the
logo change was the medical
center’s interest and $10,000 to
$20,000 toward the project. All
the initial meetings held were
focused upon keeping the
prices down. I

The end result of these meet-
ings was the total price coming
down to $15,000. “If we weren’t
able to do it [cheaply],
we weren’t going to do it,” Gill
said.

Cost was kept down by hiring
an outside designer to create
the logo. According to Gill,
“Once the initial fee was paid,
then we used an in-house
design staff to do the rest 
we’ve been keeping a record of
user comments rather than
using market research  that
helped a lot.”

University Graphics and
Printing was also relied upon
heavily to come up with a price
list which helped to keep costs
down. Another important fea-
ture of the cost-cutting mea-
sures included a 12 to 18 month
phase-in period.

Instead of having faculty
members throw out all of their
antiquated stationary, they are
instructed to use up the reserves
until they are empty.

“Any time you implement an
identification change this large,
you are going to have to phase
it in as well as deal with the
comments that go along with
the changes  We get three to
five calls a week for guidance
and to give comments on the
new seal,” said Gill.

The transition began in July.
According to Gill, there has
been a lot of positive responses
from the changes.

“lThe old logo] was very
much like Chatham [University’s
seal], both were William Pitt’s
shield,” said Mauclair. “This will
add a ﬂavor to things that were
not here before. It is more ele-
gant.”

Fire damage at King
Edward Apartments
estimated at $100,000

By Travis Senseny
For The Pitt News

—A three-alarm ﬁre broke out
yesterday around 12:30 p.m. in
the basement of the King
Edward Apartments on the cor-
ner of Bayard and North Craig
streets. '

There were no injuries result-
ing from the ﬁre, and the initial
damage estimates were placed
at $100,000, according to
Fire Battalion Chief Jerry
Crowley. Eleven fire trucks

were on the scene, and the ﬁre
was said to be under control at
1:40 

According to Crowley, the ﬁre
began above a boiler in the
basement and spread up under
the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

“There was not a whole lot
of fire, we were more con-
cerned about the smoke.
Heavy smoke travels up and
can cause ﬁre in the top ﬂoors,”
he said.

forms and practice various
series of moves with imagi-
nary opponents and sparring.
“I also teach visualization,
stress management, the differ-
ent types of chemical agents
and sprays, stun guns or elec-
trical current, practical and
close range confrontational
skills and counter measures,”
he said.
The Smith method of per-

sonal protection course is .

taught in three parts. The first
part is static training where
students learn the “ABCs” of

defense in a controlled envi-

ronment. The second part is
ﬂuid training, where relation-
ships of time and distance are
developed for continuity.
Students learn how to either

escalate or disengage from a‘

scene. In the final part, stu-
dents learn street relations

-where stress and tension reali-

ty is better understood in an
open environment. '
“‘The Buy Yourself A
Minute’ program is adapted to
make people streetwise to
exactly the ﬂavor of the way

they were brought up,” Smith
said.

The biggest misconception
people have is, “It won’t hap-
pen to me.” Most guys say
they are able to take care of
themselves and their girl-
friends. They are the ones

' who should take the course.

Unfortunately crime doesn’t
discriminate to leave any par-
ticular person alone, and a
person can’t take anything for
granted. The true philosophy
of defense is always expect
the unexpected, according to
Smith.

The course is becoming
popular among students. One
course is offered this fall and
two courses offered next
semester.

“People ‘who belong to
other groups and would like
some self—defense instruc-
tions, I can be contacted to
make other arrangements,”
Smith said.

As if being a patrol officer
and a defense instructor
weren’t enough, Smith is also
a current police athletic
league martial arts director
and a member of the Fraternal
Order of Police. He is a police
instructor at the Criminal
justice Training Center of
Pennsylvania and national
instructor for the Impact

Weaponsfor Security and
Law Enforcement Training
department. ~

After graduating from the
Allegheny County Police
Academy in 1980, Smith
became a certified police offi-
cer and self—defense instruc-
tor. He conducts courses in
mechanics of arrest, executive
protection, straight baton and
other speciﬁc procedures. He
is either a member, a repre-
sentative or associated to over
16 organizations that are
involved with law enforce-
ment and martial arts.

“I get a big appreciation in
sharing or helping someone
out. Someone will always
have a story to tell you and
can share information with
you  and people learn from
other people,” he said. ‘

Smith’s enthusiasm of what
he does caught the attention
of people in the film and
video industry. Smith per-
formed the main fight scene
in the fantasy video, “Masters
of the Gridiron.” Smith has
also appearedon numerous
television shows and com-
mercials. When Smith isn’t at
one of these places doing
something, he might be home
catching some sleep or doing
something with his wife and
four children.

Hassan said; “Abstinence is

a very good method, but it
is not the method that is
chosen [by young people].
It is NOT a‘ contraceptive,

‘ but it is a reproductive
right.” "

Asked if the Supreme

said, “Different states have

wants to create a 24-hour

is wrong. The decision to

not be made lightly. A 24-

The issue of Gianna

an accurate representation
of abortion. It has nothing
to do with what we are
dealing with,” she said.

Some members of Pitt’s
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance were on hand to
support CWO’s demonstra-
tion. Member Todd
Kinavey said, “I’m pro-
choice and wanted to
make a statement. Men
should care too [even if
they] don’t have to worry
about getting pregnant or

’ having children.”

Others from CWO were
asking the pro-lifers why
children who are infected

"with the AIDS virus should
be be brought to term, and ‘

why school policies of
abstinence are still produc-
ing pregnant students.
According to George
Murtagh, a Roman Catholic
pro-lifer, “llt is al scientific
fact  abortion stops a
beating heart. It’s not right

Other ‘naysayers of the

_Pastor Jack Carothers who

said, “Choice stops for a

said Helen
Cindrich, executive direc-
tor of PCUC.

According to Cindrich,
people from more than 60
churches attended the
local Life Chain.

Johnson was one of
several victims of abor-
tion who said their expe-
riences have led them to

A become pro-life, but one

Pitt student said the Bible
is behind his belief in this
effort.

“All Christians should
stick together and protest
the mur—der of unborn
children,” student Paul
Stinelli said. “The
Ten Commandments tells
us we don’t have the
right to kill.”

 About 15 jstudents

participated iniftlie event,

.which included many

individuals, especially
senior citizens, visibly
praying and saying
rosaries on the sidewalk.

“I don’t know many of
these people here,” stu-
dent Mandy Chelik said.
“But I feel close to them
because I know we all
have the same goal in
mind.”

“We’ve come together
here for an hour to
demonstrate against the
1.6 million unborn chil-
dren murdered every year
by abortion in the United
States,” Jeff Paladina
said.

Paladina is president
of Pitt Students for Life,
whose members com-
prised most of the Pitt stu-
dents at the Life Chain.

Craig Collins, a senior
at Pitt, said he attended in
thankfulness for his moth-
er not having an abortion.

“When I was born, my
mother was in the middle
of a divorce and I was the
third child,” Collins said.
“It was not easy for a sin-
gle mother back then, but
I am obviously happy she
had me.”

Many demonstrators
also stressed that they
were more “pro-women”
than the pro—choice
movement.

“We, try to help women
that need any assistance,”
_Chelik said.’ “We empha-
size saving the child and

. helping the mother.”

Most of the pro-lifers
watched silently as pro-
choicer demonstrators
walked by, but student
Robyn Hepler said the
pro—choice group was a
target of the event.

“We are praying for the
protesters, that they can
open their eyes to what
they are standing for,”
Hepler said. “Abortion
completely demeans
women. We are here for
the women just as much
as we are here for chil-
dren.”

Some of the ideas posed by the students included a candidate
with sensitivity to minority issues, someone with a wide range
of knowledge who will assist students with the changing job mar-
ket and one who can move the law school in a forward direction

and primarily “clean up house.”

Juhl said the committee hopes to meet the requirements set by
the students, chancellor and provost and “cast a wide net that

-includes women and minority candidates.”

Charlotte Dunmore, director of the Master of Social Work pro-
gram and committee member, said the dean’s job would not be an

easyvor glamorous position.

“We need to find a _candidate who exhibits a certain steadfast-

ness,” Dunmore said.

“We’re facing rough waters ahead, and our candidate needs
to show a certain toughness that can weather these storms,” she

said.

Although the nominations are just beginning to trickle in, the
committee plans to conclude its search by July, 1994.

‘‘We’d like to make everyone happy,” Juhl said. “We won’t. But if
we can make every group happy just a little bit, we know we have

the right person for the job.”

Pitt in the medical _ field.
Students in these schools need
to be certified in CPR.

Donna Zieglar and Amy Ouch
were there for another reason.
They came “to get certified for
lifeguarding,” Zieglar said. She
said this would be her fourth
time for the course.

Certification is good for two
years. At the end of the second
year, the person must attend
two four—hour sessions to retain
their certification.

According to Mahr, there are
three levels of courses: level A,

which deals with adult CPR;
level D, which deals with
pediatric CPR and level C,
which deals with all aspects of
CPR.

Mahr said the course offered
on Saturday was level C and
consisted of the following tech-
niques: airway management,
rescue breathing, CPR, heimlich
maneuver and airway obstruc-
tion manipulation.

The Student Health Service
offers many courses a year for
those in health—related profes-
sional schools or anyone who is
interested. '

Eunchong Kim, a student
at Pitt, claimed she has got-

ten two parking tickets at the _

same parking meter, and
both times the meter was
broken. Goldstein explained
to Kim that if she wants, she
can go to traffic court and
fight the citations. I

The president of the
Korean Student Association,
Kwangduk Kim, raised some
questions about giving per-
mission for hospitals to per-
form emergency work on a

family member.

Goldstein said that if the
parents do not live ‘in the
country, then there is a pos-
sibility that a power of attor-
hey can be obtained. This
would give an immediate
family member, such as a
sibling, the right to tell a doc-

tor to go ahead with an oper-
ation if the patient was not
able to speak.

Goldstein also spoke to
the students about the differ-
ent ways of obtaining green
cards and visas. He said the
quickest way to obtain a
green card would be to
marry a U.S. citizen. Another
option is if the person had a
job with a company that
would be willing to sponsor
him/her for permanent resi-
dence. After permanent resi-
dence is established, the per-
son can then apply for
a three—year visa or green
card.

Kim said that the Korean
Student Association gives
any interested students a
chance 3:0 learn about
Korean-American culture.
They also assist foreign stu-
dents in getting adjusted to
the new settings they find in
Pittsburgh.

The apartment complex has 21

Crowley said that the first con-
cern of firefighters in a high-rise
situation is to make sure all
elderly residents are evacuated
safely.

Masney said, "An elderly
woman in the apartment next to
mine needed my help to get out

The fire was ruled accidental
by fire officials. “There was no
evidence of arson. The cause of
the fire was a missing panel

up over a period of time,”
Crowly said.

North Craig Street and Bayard

Free trade

The debate over the North American Free Trade
Agreement, and whether it will be good or. bad for
America, can be heard in the corridors of the U.S. capi-
tol and across the nation. '

NAFTA, whether Congress ratifies it or not, will have
a significant effect on our nation’s economic recovery
and hopeful stability in future years. Much criticism of
the agreement has centered on trade with Mexico and
the concern that American, companies will move south
of the border, thus destroying jobs here at home.
According to The Washington Post, this concern is
mainly due to Mexico’s low wages.

The ‘treaty, which will lift all trade barriers between
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, will benefit the U.S. in
numerous ways. According to Rufus Yerxa, the deputy
U.S. trade representative and chief NAFTA negotiator,
since 1987,‘ when Mexicovbegan reducing many -trade
barriers, U.S. exports to Mexico tripled to over $40 bil-
lion in 1992 and over 400,000 U.S. jobs were created.
Due to these reduced barriers, America’s former trade
deficit in regards to Mexico is now a surplus.“ '

Moreover, one of the best benefits that NAFTA will
bring about is the reduction of illegal immigration, a
problem California is finding increasingly more difficult
to deal with. Nothing can help this problem more than
economic growth in Mexico. A 1991 study by the
University of California reported that internal reforms in
Mexico and free trade with the United States would
combine to reduce migration to the U.S. by. between
262,000 and 1.1 million people.

Mexico’s economic situation is sure to stabilize with

the implementation.o_f.- NAFTA and its supplemental

agreements. The agreement between Canada, Mexico
and the US also commits to unprecedented labor-
rights protections. Studies conducted by the
International Trade Commission show that Mexico’s
economy will grow by as much as several percentage
points and raise both Mexican and U.S. wages.

The list of what will transpire if NAFTA is ratified and
subsequently implemented goes on." It is evident that
maintaining the status quo as it now stands in terms of
North American trade will not help us create’ jobs or
expand our economic base. NAFTA is also the most
environmentally conscious of agreements of its kind. Its
application will be equitable to U.S. investors, will
obligate Mexico to effectively enforce its health and
safety laws, and perhaps most importantly, is sure to
increase U.S. exports. Mexico is currently the United
States’ second-leading market formanufactured goods,
and third largest for agricultural goods-.

Capital goods, ranging from medical to scientific
goods, currently make up 35 percent of U.S.,exports to
Mexico. Mexico has a tremendous need for such goods.
When America, and not Asian countries, supply such
products, continued growth of U.S. exports and jobs at
home are assured,‘ which is justwhat is needed- 0

With the eradication of small
pox and polio, it seemed
mankind was destinedlto win its
battle against disease. Yet just
as it seemed that there were no
untreatable diseases, a new
threat appeared: Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

Even though most people
appear to realize the danger of
AIDS, they don’t seem to Jake it

“seriously. AIDS destroys the

immune system, and without it,
people don’t survive. Despite
the fact that AIDS is always
fatal, there is a movement to
make AIDS seem benign.

The University Book Center at
Pitt distributed a “Term Planner”
to students when they bought
their books. About midway in
the planner is the “Surgeon
General’s Report on AIDS.” It is
good that an attempt is being
made to educate people, but it
is worse to learn facts that are
incorrect than to be completely
ignorant. The wording of this
report glosses over the truth:
”AIDS destroys the immune sys-
tem  [and] may eventually

cause death.” The report also

perpetuates the idea that AIDS
is predominantly confined to
small segments of the popula-
tion. AIDS is always fatal, there
is no “may” about this fact. Also,
vimses don’t discriminate. They
are happy to wreak havoc on

_ whoever they infect. .5

  AIDS I danger isstill not tel/een seriously

AIDS also gets a benign repu-
tation from people like Irving
“Magic” Johnson. The govern-
ment redeﬁned its definition of
AIDS to include everyone who
is HIV positive. This is good
because these people need
help, but we must be careful
not to view asymptomatic AIDS
patients as healthy.

We laud Mag-iC..Johnson for...
his'”courage in-facing the dis-5-

Benjamin
Jackson

ease.
He continued his life as
though he were healthy, win-
ning an Olympic Gold Medal,
etc. But what message does this
send? “I have AIDS and can win
a gold medal. So, it’s no big
deal. What are you worrying
about?” People use this line of
reasoning and are not careful.
Will we see Magic Jolmson
when he is sick and the magic
has gone? Probably not.
A So what do we do? We could
always take steps like Cuba,
who, according to the New
Eng/mm’ jo-urnal of Medicine,
puts all of its AIDS patients in
sanatariums. Norway was con-

sidering similar measures. Our
_ -"own country had a similar plan

with tuberculosis patients in the
first part of this century.
However, as a bumper sticker
once put it, we must “Fight
AIDS not people with AIDS.”
You must identify a problem
to solve it. So we should begin
mandatory testing of all health-
care workers. Test everyone
entering hospitals and test mar-
riage 'l.ieense':eappl‘‘iezints. ‘
Health-care. workers who are

SHIV positive should not be

allowed to. practice on HIV-neg»
ative patients. If a person with
tuberculosis is not allowed to
handle food, why should we let
a doctor with AIDS treat
patients?

The chances of transmission
are low, but look at the dentist
in Florida who infected an
unknown number of patients.

Testing patients entering hos-
pitals will protect health-care
workers and often aid in treat-
ment. 1

Finally, it is time to tell people
the truth. AIDS kills all of its vic-
tims all of the time. Perhaps if
Magic Johnson wants to help
educate people, he’ll let the
media track the progression» of
his disease.

It will scare people out of
their wits, but at_least they'll
wake up.

Remarks of BAS member anti-Jewish .

From Annastasia Faith’s letter (The Pitt News, Sept. 27), we can see that the Black Action Society has
stopped whining, for the moment, about how much the university administration “owes” it and has
turned, once‘ again, to what seems to be its favorite subject: anti-Jewish vitriol.

‘While we don’t usually respond to every Jew—hating dog that barks, we feel that in this case a proper
response is required. We really couldn’t care less about how Miss Faith or other representatives of the
BAS feel about Israel. We know that everyday Jews exist in our God given Jewish state of Israel it
bums her and those like her up. Get. one thing clear Annastasia — we plan to continue to do so, so try

not to have a stroke.

Miss Faith’s remarks about Israel, and implicitly, about Jews, stem not so much from a sense of soli-
darity with Arabs but from hatred and jealousy of Jews. Yes, the sad fact is that Miss Faith and those
like her at BAS, who seem chronically and terminally afflicted with “entitlement syndrome,” survive on
handouts from others andareunable to make it on_ their own.

Choosing one word to

describe Pitt’s fourth game of
the season is difficult.

At times Saturday night’s
clash with Louisville seemed
“encoL1raging,” “hopeful” and
downright “good.” The game
was still close. ’

Other times, however, mainly
in the. second half, the words
“expected,” “reality” and clown-
right “over-matched"’ fixed the

sword-choice dilemma. The

marginwas now as predicted.

The score, a 29-7 win for_

18th ranked and unbeaten
Louisville (5-0), was still very
misleading. Describing that in
one word is impossible.
- Here’s why.

With the game still close in
the second quarter, the
momentum was definitely in

A the Panthers’ favor.

With some sporadically good
defense and the help of several
Louisville dropped passes and
penalties, Pitt (1-5) needed
only Curtis Martin’s 59-yard
inspiring dash to set up its only
touchdown and a surprising 7-6
halftime lead.

"We gave ‘them ' life ’ when we

son,” Schnellenberger added.

first half.

After Cardinal quarterback
J eff. .Brohm. .,threw, a. perfect
st-ri'ke to‘ a wide open Mario
Bailey in the corner of Pitt’s
end zone late in the first quar-
ter, Louisville appeared to take
the early lead.

But the ball bounced right off
of Bailey’s chest, and
Louisvilleis David Akers missed
a 56-yard field goal to keep the
score deadlocked at zero.

While the Pitt offense was

sputtering, Louisville again
moved the ball in the second

.quarter but could not score a

touchdown. .

Two apparent touchdown
passes from Brohmto running
backs Jaime Asher and Ralph
Dawkins were called back for
an illegal motion call and
offensive pass interference.

Again Akers was called upon
for the field goal try. This time
he hit it and put Louisville up
3-0.

On Pitt’s next possession,
flanker Junior Green was lev-
elled by ‘Cardinal defensive
back Anthony Bridges" and the
apparent seven—yard pass com-
pletion turned ‘into a fumble

One hundred sixty-one
games — 99-point—something
percent of the baseball season
— and the National League
West wasnl’f anyone’s to _«own.
Two teams with 103 wins and
the same character in the
“Games Behind” column: 

The three other divisions had
already been decided, but the
San _Francisco Giants and the
Atlanta Braves didn’t want the

country to just toss this regular

season away.

Just not yet.

The regular season _hadn’t
been decided by a one-game
play—off — the fruition of a tied
season -—,— since 1978 when
Bucky Dent slammed a home
run over the Green Monster to
lead the hated Yankees over
the Red Sox in the A.L. East's
classic game. ‘ .

How could you ask for a bet-
ter script to decide the season?
The Giants and the ‘Dodgers.

There are no more Bobby
Thompsons or Carl Erskines,
but it is still a bitter fight during
even a meaningless regular sea-

(There was a fan in LA with

This one was for revenge.

This one was for real.

Back in the day, it seems,

during the Braves’ first run for__

the title two years ago, it was
the Giants who knocked the

The Giants hadn’t swept the
Dodgers on the road since the

for than another win, hit or
home run. -

struggling at 0-4 (and now 0-5),

carry it to a little post—season

chance — to beat the Braves
and send them into hibernation

best pitcher the past three
years, hoping to push his
Braves into the National League

Brohm '5 bombing,

By Jason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Pitt knew going into
Saturday’s game against
Louisville that if it was to have
any defensive success it would
have to stop quarterback Jeff

: Brohm. -

Guess what’ It didn’t happen.

Aside from lighting up the
Panthers in the air -— to the
tune of 22 completions for 340
yards and a touchdown —
Brohm rushed for 46 yards
(being sacked for 29) and
pulled the Cardinals’ collective
behinds out of a penalty-
induced fire several times.

“That fella’s a good athlete,”
Pitt head coach Johnny Majors

‘said. “He’s got a strong arm,

and he’s' quick.” J

The most dramatic run may
have come in the third quarter
with the Cardinals-up by.two,
9-7.

On a third-and-15 Brohm
scrambled through the middle
for a 24-yard gain, making
moves that reminded no one of
Randall Cunningham, but left

‘Panther defenders in their

tracks.

Two plays later Louisville
running back Chris Fitzpatrick
ran around the right end for a
two—yard touchdown and, for
all intents and purposes, put
the game away.

“lBrohm’s running was] pure
instinct,” Louisville head coach
Howard Schnellenberger said.

ied passing game. It was a little
surprising in the wet, cold con-
ditions at Pitt Stadium. A

“We didn’t want to throw
quite as much as we did  we
wanted to run the ball,” Brohm
said.

“But we got behind, and they
were fired up and started blitz-
ing a little bit, so we had to go
pass. .

“Passing has been our key all
year. We felt coming into the
game that we were going to be
able to run the ball more and
pick up some yards on the
ground, knowing Pitt’s history
in their first four games. They
came out, picked things up
well and got on top of us. That
made us throw a lot more than
we wanted.” ’ '

‘‘I wouldn’t say we aban-
doned the run, but the penal-
ties forced us to pass,”
Dawkins said. “It would be see-
ond—and—five, and we would
get a holding penalty and were
forced to pass.” "

Dawkins, who has started 39
games — every game of his
career at Louisville — racked
up only 63 yards rushing but
55 through the air and broke
Earnest Givens career recep-
tions mark at the school — a
distinction that he was oblivi-
ous to.

“Not to take the credit way
from Pitt, but they weren’t

The Pitt Rugby club suf-
fered its first loss of the sea-
son Saturday afternoon. The
West Virginia Mountaineers
defeated the Panthers, 6-0,
at Frick Park. '

Pitt completely dominated
the early action. The
Mountaineers were bottled
up in the their own end for
most of the first half. The
Panthers had numerous
scoring chances but were
never able to capitalize.

Pitt had a golden opportu-
nity to score when J.D.
Groff muscled the ball into
the WVU try zone. But the
Mountaineers’ defenders
wouldn’t let Groff touch the
ball to the ground for the
try, and the Panthers came
away empty.

West Virginia scored the
only points of the half by

two teams in the second
half. The teams were evenly
matched. It was clear that
the first team that would be
able to score a try would
have a huge advantage in
the game. Butboth defenses

scoring of the day was to
come from penalty kicks.

WVU had the first oppor-
tunity but it missed a penal-

Soccer falls to ‘Nova

The Pitt soccer team’s season
took a backwards spin against
Villanova last Saturday when a
Wildcats’ crossing pass from
the endline caromed off a Pitt
defender and spun up into the
corner of the net to lift
Villanova to a 1-0 victory.

The goal, which was credited
to Doug Nevins at the 74
minute and 16 second mark of
the second half, broke open a
tightly—played and scoreless
game, giving the Panthers a
loss in an all important Big East
game.

“[Villanoval had the better of
play,” Pitt soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher said.

The game served as another
example of the Pitt forwards
inability to put the ball in the
g net, or for that matter, even at
the net.

“That is a problem,”
Luxbacher said. “We’re not
generating goals.

The Panther front line, which
has not scored a goal in the last

-three games, has been hurt by

injuries to 1991 and 1992 lead-
ing scorer Eric Prex.

Pre_x broke his left arm
before the season started. He
rebroke the aim last week.

“He is our key man,”
Luxbacher said. “We need
someone else to pick up the
slack and nobody has done it.

“Nobody up front is jumping
up and saying, ‘Yeah, I’m the
man,’ and taking control of the
position. We are in every game
but nobody isstepping up big.”

Pitt. (3-3-2) amassed only six
shots on the Villanova net, two
of which came from the for-
wards — one by Prex and the
other by Todd Graf.

“We didn’t really threaten,”
Luxbacher said.

Pitt running back Curtis
Martin snatched the handoff
from quarterback John Ryan
and headed upfield searching
for a hole.

Everywhere he looked he
saw Louisville defenders clos-
ing in on him.

So Martin put his head down
and barreled into defensive end
Leonard Ray. Ray and a host of
other Cardinals stood Martin up
and knocked him back down-
field.

Martin, however, refused to 

go to the turf.

“I’m determined not to let
one man bring me down,”
Martin said.

It doesn't matter how many(
points the Panthers are down
(in this case 15) nor does it
matter how many defenders are
grabbing at his heels, because
Martin will never quit. . .

“I like.to fight,-scratch, bite

. whatever it takes until I’m
on the ground,” Martin said.

Martin found himself on the
ground quite a bit on Saturday

against Louisville. Not on his X

back mind you but up and run-
ning.

Despite the 29-7 loss Pitt suf-
fered' to Louisville, Martin
attained his most productive
night in a.Pitt uniform. He
rushed for a career high 175
yards on 25 carries and scored
the Panthers, only touchdown.

Martin whirled his way
toward long gains mostly ‘after
having initially been hit at the
line of scrimmage.

“Curtis did a great job of giv-
ing a second effort to get
open,” offensive tackle Reuben-
Brown said.

Louisville . head coach
Howard Schnellenberger said
that as -a defensive philosophy
his defense is designed to take_
away the wide receivers and
the pass_ing game. However,
Schnellenberger also said that
his teams’ game plan did not
open up any extra room for
Martin to run‘.

"'[Martin] had‘ a big day

‘ because he is a tough son of a

bitch,” Schnellenberger said.
“He ran over us and around us.

fHe ‘challenges your manhood

every time he carries the ball.”
With five minutes to go in

the first half, Martin —- who

had been picking and weaving

(his. way through the Louisville

defense —- ﬁnally busted a 59-
yard jaunt up the middle.

The run was a Martin classic.

School got wrapped up at the-

Unfortunately, there weren’t
enough of them.”

If there weren’t enough of
those plays for Pitt on Saturday,
it wasn’t because Martin didn’t
hold up his end.

Two plays later Martin dove
into the end zone from six
yards out with a defender rid-.
ing on his back to give Pitt its
only touchdown of the night.

The 59-yarder wasn’t the only
big run for Martin. He also
scampered for runs of 21 and
18 yards.

Even -though he darted for
more yardage than he ever had
before and accounted for all
but 41 yards of the Panthers’
total output, Martin didn’t want
the congratulations.

“That’s my job. I give all the
credit to the offensive line,”
Martin said.

The offensive line will take it,

3

however.

.. “Absolutely,” Brown said.
“When your running back is
out there making the plays 
that makes you feel pretty
good. I take a little pride in
that.”A

For Martin on Saturday and
in every other game, giving up
is not in the program — no
matter if Pitt is winning or los-
ing. Martin is always going to
give the second effort.

“My” theory is  if they can’t
touch me, they can’t hit me,”
Martin said. “If they can’t hit
me, they’re not gonna tackle
me..And if they can’t tackle me,
I’m gonna 1'un.”

Looking at the numbers
Martin was able to rack up,
apparently the Louisville
Cardinals icouldn’t touch him or
at least keep their hands on
him when they did.

That’s when it happened. Instead of

Martins run did just that. The junior

But Bridges did stop Martin as he
caught him from behind at the

Billy Davis. Davis, however, still had his
back to Ryan, and the low pass hit the
back of his foot and landed in the wait-
ing hands of LOuisville’s Cavallo.

Cavallo returned the interception for a
touchdown and put the game out of
reach.

And brought all the Pitt faithful back

to the reality of playing a top-20 team.

“We were definitely beaten by a good
football team,” Pitt head coach John
Majors said. “They have more strength,
more speed and more experience.

“I’m not pleased that we lost, [but] it’s
encouraging to see us in a game with a
good team,” Majors added. “lt’s very

But kind of misleading.

Pitt could have lost by a wider margin

defense,‘ Louisville committed too many
mistakes for a nationally-ranked team,
and that was the reason for the close-
ness of the final score.

“We were Overfocused in this game,”
Schnellenberger explained‘ of
LOuisville’s problems. “That is the only
reason why we didn’t catch the ball and
hit [opposing] players in the back.”

Overfocused might fit the elusive
description of Pitt’s fourth game of the
season. Then again it might not.

Continued from page 11

The Panthers were given
Christmas gifts early against the
Cards. Louisville was whistled
for 12 penalties for 117 yards
(with two touchdowns on the
same drive called back because
of ﬂags) and had too many
passes bounce off shoulder
pads to sit well with Brohm.

“lThe dropped passes] h_ap-
pened a lot last year, but in the
first four games we kept them
to a minimum,” Brohm said.
“But in this game for some rea-
son, we went back to the same
thing.

“It’s frustrating because the
drops came on big plays 
touchdowns  but you got to
keep them in focus and come
back and play.

“\X/‘e had all kinds of penal-
ties and mistakes, then key
plays were called ba.c;k«. We
came ou-t in the second half
and knew if we played hard
and putlthings together it
would fall in place for us,” he
said.

“The penalties killed our spir-
it,” Dawkins said, “and we had
a few passes dropped. That
really slowed us up a lot.”

The penalties, combined with
Pitt’s defensive intensity, put a
big scare into the nation’s 18th-

ranked team.

“[Pitt] made me sweat,”
Schnellenberger said. “They
made my kids double their
efforts and forced us to learn a

Louisville quarterback Jeff Brohm rushed for 46 yards against Pitt Saturday.
"right, there are a lot of penal-

ties that probably we deserve
that sometimes aren’t called,
and you drop the ball that you
usually catch, and you don’t
have many points on the
board.”

PITT NOTES: Pitt standout
wide receiver Dietrich Jells,
absent from Saturday's game
with a knee injury, will under-
go arthroscopic knee surgery
this week. He may miss the

head coach Cindy Braziel said. “The
team weathered a lot of adversity this
weekend, ranging from bizarre occur-
rences to Carrie being injured. It was as

difficult a weekend as it could have 0

been and coming out with three wins
 I am extremely pleased.”

The three victories established Pitt
ﬁrmly in its usual position — on top of
the Big East. 0 t

“I don’t think there are many teams in
the country that can  play the next
thre_e toughest teams [in their confer-
ence] on this kind of road trip and do
as well,” Braziel said. “We feel confi-

’ dent now that we’re going to win the

regular season [conference] champi-
onship.”

Pitt had what Braziel called its tough-
est match Friday night — a four-game
win at Seton Hall (15-11, 10-15, 15-11,
15-9).

Pitt’s had a relapse of its defensive

problems against the Pirates.

“The weakest aspect of our game is
still the point-scoring aspect, which is
blocking and defense,” Braziel said.
“Seton Hall is a very big team. We’re

not going. to stop them very well defen-

sively, which means we’re not going to
score a lot of points.

Pitt did have one of its better matches

blocking with 25 assists and three solos
in the match. Driscoll swatted one solo
block and seven assists, while Mikla had
two solos and five assists.
I “Either we stuffed it or we didn’t get it
up,” Braziel said. “If they’ got the ball
past our block, we weren’t able to con-
trol it.”

Pitt won on the strength of its most
efficient attack of the weekend (.297
attack percentage). -Lucanie (24 killshon
.488 attacking) and Driscoll (11 on .500)
carried most of the offensive load.

Seton Hall got a lift from rookie Baiba
Zake, who had only played two match-

 

es entering the weekend. She found
open ﬂoor with 21 kills on a .306 per-
centage.

“She is by far their best player,”
Braziel said. “She was the only person
that hurt us on the court.”

Zake had very little help. The normal-
ly—potent Pirate offense hit for only a
.168 percentage. Junior middle blocker
Parette Arrington and senior middle
blocker Andrea Kaspar, who had been
first and third in the conference in hit-
ting percentage, combined for 10 kills
and 12 hitting errors, a negative hitting
percentage.

The Panthers lost as they won, as
Thornton suffered a second—degree
sprain of her left ankle. She was on
crutches the rest of the weekend.
Braziel estimated she would return in a
few weeks.

Although Seton Hall (9-3, 0-1 in the
Big East) may be Pitt’s toughest compe-
tition in the conference, circumstances

THE prrr NEWS, Monday, October 4, 1993

made the Providence match the most
dangerous one for the Panthers. The
travel delays limited Pitt’s pregame time,
which was important with rookie Laurie
Fernandez in Thornton’s place.

“Our first game, we were a little out
of sync, which is to be expected,”
Braziel said. “I’m not sure Providence
was our toughest competitor. I think
Seton Hall might have been. Because of
our adjustments, it proved to be a diffi-
cult match for us.”

Pitt fell behind two games two one
before taking control of the match and
winning in five.

The key for the Friars is defense, and
they had a slight edge of 93 digs to
Pitt’s 86 in the match. Pitt had the
attacking advantage, as expected, with
10 more kills and a better hitting per-
centage (.238 to .190). -

Ann Marie Lucanie was the major dif-
ference, smashing 31 kills on a .328 per-

centage. With Thornton out, the rest of the
Pitt attack centered again on middle hitters
Jennie Driscoll (18 kills) and Sarah Mikla (12
kills). Mikla also continued to provide solid
blocking with seven assists on the front line
of defense. Sara Mitchell topped the back
line of the defensive end with 23 digs.

Sophomores Jocelyn Cole and Kelly
Tooley had been Providence’s top attackers
but combined for only 18 digs with nine
errors and a .176 percentage.

Senior outside hitter Missy Dawson
returned after missing four matches due to a
severe ankle sprain and racked up 19 digs
and 21 kills but had a relatively low .204
percentage. Aileen Koprowski continued to
lead the Providence defense with 20 digs
and five blocking assists.

Yesterday’s Pitt match at Connecticut was
like a replay of some earlier Pitt matches.
The Panthers pulled out to a two—games-to-
nonevadvantage then stumbled to a 15-4 loss
in game three.

“I can’t complain [about a letdownl,”
Braziel said. “It’s just been a hellacious time
for us. We did lapse grossly, but there are
things that factored into it. I don’t feel as
bad about that lapse as I did about [earlier
ones].” -

Pitt came back to win a 15-11 ‘decision in
game four to remain undefeated in Big East
play.

Lucanie had team highs in digs (18) and
kills (17) but had a .200 hitting percentage,
.174 below her season average. Driscoll and
Mikla both chipped in double figures in kills
with 10 and 14, respectively.

ended with the Panthers
looking strong but on the

Besides having to contend
with each other, both teams
had to deal with a cold,
steady rain that turned the
field into a slippery mud pit.

“WVU knows how to play.

“Next week’s game is the
most important of the year,”
Gray said.

“It’s important that we get
a win and control our own
destiny.”

The Economics of the Citibank
Classic Visa card. How Student Discounts and Price
n Protection contribute to upward growth. A variety of factors have been
suggested as contributing to the economic growth of students, including (1) more lottery winners
between the ages of 18 and 22, (2) a 37% increase on earnings from bottle and can returns, (3) more
students doubling earnings in the lightning round of game shows, and (4) theCitibank Classic Visa®
card. It’s this last one, however, that affects most students. ‘H The Citibank Classic Visa card offers
immediate savings to student cardmembeis. You can save up to 26% on long distance calls versus AT&T

1 (with the free Citibank Calling Service“ from MCI.‘ And you can capitalize on a $20 Airfare Discount

for domestic ﬂights? Savings on mail order pur-
chases, sports equipment, magazines and music
also abound. Maximize these savings with a low
