Delivers Promised Bull

To Editor of ‘Press’

(A Pittsburgh Press editorial suggested that students who prefer
anonymity, such. as those who placed a bull on top of a building,
are a refreshing contrast to those who get involved.)

A highly placed, reliable spokesman for the Anonymous
Volunteer Committee for the Advancement of College
Pranks (AVCACP), has announced the execution of an

Olde Style College Pranke.

,According to the spokesman, a solemn group proceed-

ed downtown Wednesday eve-
ning in two unmarked vehicles.

[About 11 p.m. the group passed

through The Pittsburgh Press’
portals and gained entrance to

' the second floor.

With grim determination, the
well-dressed ‘committee ' of 12
skidded single-file along the sud-
sy floor, which the custodial gen-
darmerie hadjust begun to wash.

him a note which reportedly.

An anonymous Canadian phil-

Of Educators and WQED     

University professors and others continue to evaluate the eﬂ"ects of the teach-in I 

movement in education.

“The teach-ins are deﬁnitely not a one-s-hot affair," commented Dr. Janice Gib; 
son, assistant professor of psychology. She added that the student response indicates ” _‘
’a trend to more student interest in national_ affairs. ‘Students are learning to- be more “—‘;_.

National teach-ins do not allow the student reaction that the local exchange of I 
ideas provoke, according to Dr. Gibson. She‘ was “surprised and encouraged” by the ma-  _

“Students can be a potent weap-

son continued. She said. how-
ever, she would “wait and see.”

Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associ-

ate professor of sociology, doubt»

ed that the teach-in method
could be used again with effec-
tiveness, although he conceded
I that “any discussion on social is-

sues is educational.” Dr. Berke-
witz felt that the national teach-
in depended upon mass media
for its impact in dramatizing the
Vietnam issue.

_ “The major problem with na-
tional teach-ins is that they oc-
cur at inconvenient times—the
Saturday night program here at
Pitt was an example," he said.
He noted that street demonstra-
tions have greater impact_ than

teach-ins, if publicity on national.

Baseball Team Wins N

Beat Hiram,

Dukes,WVU
For Top Bid

By'.l‘0MSACKS

The baseball team has ﬁ-
nally won the elusive bid to
the NCAA Regionals, Win-
ning three crucial games last
week. The mitters play Laf-
ayette in F‘riday’s opening
round at Princeton, New Jer-
sey. Princeton meets Rider
College in the other ﬁrst
round game.

Hiram, West Virginia, and
Duquesne were the mitters
stepping stones last week. They
ran their season record to 16-3,
compiling 34 hits and 14 runs
against their opponents’ total of
14 hits and three runs.

The big names again were
Dave Blyshak and Lee Brueckel.
Blyshak won two games, while
Brueckel conquered West Vir-
ginia. Alert ﬁelding and taking
advantage of breaks, however,
were crucial factors in all three
games. _

Typical of the week’s perform-
ance was the seventh inning of
the Duquesne game Saturday.
With one out and trailing 5-1, the
Dukes had loaded the bases on
two singles and an error. The
next batter hit a deep ﬂy to Fred

and attempted to advance. Ma-

Cop Third

By RON SEEAREB. -

The stable With the most
entries usually has the most
winners. Penn State‘ fell in-
to that category Saturday
as they ﬁnished ﬁrst ill the
triangular track meet here.
Notre Dame athletes turn-
ed in some surprising per-

formances to capture sec-'

ond over the track team.
As in the meet at Mor-
gantown three Weeks ago, it

was the Nittany Lions’ wealth of,

talent which won the meet. Their
runners held the score close,- but
the ﬁeld events gave them the
edge. '

The Nittanies defeated Notre
Dame by nine points, 72-63, scor-
ing a ﬁrst and a third in the
ﬁnal event, the pole vault, to
win the meet. Pitt scored 46
points.

Despite rain’ that sporadically
fell all afternoon, several rec-
ords were broken. It was drizzl-
ing when Ed Dean of the Irish
set a new stadium record for the
mile with a time of 4:07.9. Both
Tom Bedick and Dick Lampman
of Penn State, who ﬁnished sec-
ond and third, respectively, also
bettered the Stadium record.

When the sun returned, it was
a Notre Dame man again setting

another. record in the three-mile 1
run. Bill C1ark,twho hails ‘from -

Philadelphia, ran the distance in
14:17 to better the old record by
31 seconds.

in the event, setting a new var-
sity record at 14:42.

The tennis team continued its

day, respectively.

Ken Perry, Kevin Berry, Sam

Duquesne University helped the golf team win its sec-

tory against nine losses.

Bill. Fassett led the team with
