Looking to JL£I‘ViV6 a nuciearoiaot cm? watt:/2 'Ba/nwoi ' at too oame time?

I don’t know if Iron Mountain
would show up on film because my
camera was conﬁscated as soon as I
arrived. I don’t seem to be inia posi-
tion to check, either, because although
I’ve completed the hour—long drive to
the site, I don’t know how I got there.

It took two forms of photo JD,

eight phone calls, the blatant.exploita— A I

tion of my uncle’s job connections, a
suspected — though not confirmed
— background check, an escort, cre-
dentials and a ﬁre extinguisher before
I was allowed to go into the facility,

which, at first glance, is little more than .

a big hole inthe ground beneath the

' woods of rural Pennsylvania.

Pitt students could‘ ruin this year’s

Dean, in a ﬁveminute speech dur-
ing his appearance in the \X/illiam Pitt
Union Assembly Room, encouraged
students to phonebank in support of
Democratic Presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama and to remember to

“The stakes are enormous, particu-
larly for people your age,” said Dean,
who ran in the 2004 presidential prima-
ry and lost -to Senjohn Kerry, D-Mass.
‘Thisisyour time Don’t blow it.” ’

Dean’s message struck Pitt junior

was Larry Yont, an employee of US. Steel who
knew of the abandoned mine and bought it to
lease as a combination document-storage facility
and nuclear holocaust-proof fallobt shelter for

i the country’s business elite. ‘

..Yont set to work the mine the homi-

est darn maximurn—security cave this nation had

ever (not) seen. He brought in crewsto outﬁt the
place with ‘its own sewage and water-treatment
systems, bus routes, ﬁre brigade, police force,‘ ex-

in the winter — the workers at Iron Mountain
looked surprisingly robust. Some even had the
nerve to be tan. i

Beyond a quick glance at the workers as
I signed in at the security desk, however, there
wasn’t much time for interaction

My tour guide, a petite redhead with an easy
smile, cold hands and high-heeled wedge shoes,
served as my guide for the clay, and she had plans
for us

Our ﬁrst stop inside the mine was her boss’s
ofﬁce, where the two of them sat me down and
explained — in detail — all the ways I could get
them ﬁred.

They said there were names I could not
use but mentioned nothing about descriptions
I couldn’t say that broadcast company X was a
customer, but I might get away with saying a big-
three national network whose symbol is an eye
stores documents there (wink, wink).

I couldrft say that I had been inside the leg-
endary ﬁlm studio vault that cleverly opens just
before Christmas every year to re-release a classic
animawd feature “for a limited time only!” but I
could say I saw the  ﬁlm reel for “Barn-
bi.” '

But I wasn’t the only one operating under re-
strictions Of the roughly 2,000 employees who
workinside the mine every day, onlya select few

For the hundreds of Vaults currendy in use,
fewer than 10 people have access _to any given
room. V

The vault doors, solid metal contraptions
that give you the uneasy feeling of  stuck
inside a walkin'ﬁ:eezer when they shut, are most-
ly marked with number—letter codes instead of
company names

 

 

Even the high proﬁle customers who agree
to have  labels  on" their doors

. do so in an understated way, without text I saw

castles, government seals and acronyms, but few
names ' _

give the impression of  nowhere so much
as inside tin—foiled leftovers in a cooler The walls,

Each container is bar-coded and stacked ac-

same way I feel tiny and acutely accident-prone

In other vaults, like those dedicated to hos-

ﬁling cabinets.

Hospitals, the guide ‘told me, store docu-
ments, slides and biological samples from tests
like biopsies in the vaults for two reasons: One,
it’s a refrigerated version of their patients’ medi-
cal histories And two, since the number of beds
a hospital contains directly correlates with their
proﬁts, storing old but vital records off-site ﬁees
up space to accommodate more patients.

But Iron Mountain preserves the darker side
of human history, as well, where glamour shots

Newspapers should become

more than just ink and paper

The Christian Science Monitor,

 a well-respected international news-

 paper, announced yesterday that it

2 will end its daily print edition and

 move to a once-weekly print edi-

 tion with heavy emphasis on online
 content. ‘

V During the last few months,

 many major newspapers have cut

ithousands of jobs and drastically
lrestructured their newsroom and
 business operations to stay in busi-
lness The Los Angeles Times is
 undergoing a 200-person reduction
 staff, and Gannet Co. Inc., the
 largest newspaper publisher in the

United States, is planning on cut-

j  about 10 percent of all news

; jobs.

; The fundamentals of the news-

 paper business are shifting severely.

 The Internet and its ability to deliv-

 er content instantaneously to any-

 where in the world has changed the

l importance of print journalism in a

 way with which traditional business

 models cannot keep pace.

M The simple fact that many major
newspapers have separate print and
online editions is only one example
of this. I

. Newspapers have been slow to
capitalize on local online distribu-
~ tion and social networking as well,

3 something that many of the largest
and most popular information sites

M like YouTube and Facebook were

1 quick to base themselves on.

It’s a shame that many vener-

3 able and respectable newspapers

 are forced to cut, lay off or buy out
staff members just to sustain their
operations. But if print journalism

 is going to survive, newspapers

M must take advantage of the Inter-

. net and all its capabilities and adapt

 to the new media marketplace.

M The Christian Science Moni-

l tor is an excellent example of this

 trend. The paper was founded in

i 1908, has won seven Pulitzer Priz-

. es, has writers based in 11 countries

 around the world and was one of

 the ﬁrst major world newspapers to
 turn to online publishing, which it

Q did in 1996. Despite this, the print

 edition of the newspaper has con-

sistently failed to make a proﬁt and
struggled to ﬁnd a sustained work-
able business model.

This could be seen as represen-
tative of the entire newspaper in-
dustry. Online readership for many
newspapers has never been higher,
yet papers cannot turn proﬁts and
have to cut operations. However,
cutting operations leaves less con-
tent to ﬁll the papers, causing less
people to buy them. Simply, news-
papers simply can’t compete with
free online content;

In 2005, journalists and writ-
ers observed that the newspaper
business was “dying.” They quoted
numerous reasons for this trend,
from the ready availability of infor- M
mation on the Internet to the fact
that newspapers aren’t essential in
this age of 24-hour news networks
and blogs. Because of this, fewer
people read print editions because
they don’t want information in a
once-a—day package anymore.

It’s obvious that  are go-
ing to change drastically for the

news industry —— they already have. 5

The only question is what will be
the fate of print journalism. We
have no doubt that it will survive,

but we’re not sure what form it will ;

take. The validity of news that print 
journalism supplies is a valuable M
public resource and provides more l

than just news, but also a written

may become buried in the Inter-
(ICE.
It’s clear that collaboration be-

more important than it ever has i

been, and the only way for newspa-
pers to survive in this new informa-

THE PARTY OF FlSCAL DISCIPLJNE

MCI Campus

Language needs to be used sensibly

by Erik Hinton
Colum/zidt

Among slushies and not-quite-
opiate power shots, I realized that in
this convenience mart language had
become shipwrecked somewhere
between stupidity and senselessness
Propped above the cash  was
a  that  reported, ‘We do
notchargeapremiumoncreditcard

35—cent discount for cash purchases,
which is already factored into the prices
display ” After saying a short eulogy
to language, I purchased my candy bar
with all nickels, sadly countenancing my
seven-nickel discount;

At ﬁrst glance, there seems to be
nothing terribly egregious about this

The simple assumption that this
semantic sleight of hand rests upon is
thatone merelyhas topaylip service
to words as dictionary meanings rather
thantreatwords as theyareusecl “Dis—
count’ ’ may be deﬁned, simply, as “pay-
ing less for something than someone
else pays,” but no one actiiallyuses the
word in this stripped-down way. “No
sir,youarenotgettingaspeedingticket.
You have just lost your right to partici-
pate in the discount that non-speeders
pay to the government.”

The simple lesson thus far. If we
imagine words to have some mean-
ing outside of normal practice, we will

 

soon run afoul of sensible usage
Consider a less trivial scenario: gay
marriage Obama steadliastiy disavows
gay marriage However, he supports al-
lowing gay couples to engageinunions

sertinga rightto rule howwe use lan-
guage The government only has the

not to language. In governmental logic,
two  that are identical in the eyes
of the law should be identical
So what’s the remedy to these ri-
diculous abuses of language? We need
a return to the idea that meaning only
exists in context, that meaning is the
result of the system of language rather
than its components Otherwise, we
will continually be the patsy for these
semantic shell games
We accept the asinine convenience
store tariff and language legislation
because we have developed a view of
language that allows words to have
meanings completely by themselves
Rather, “discount” only makes sense
in a situation where there is some pre-
established price in excess of the dis-
count.

“Marriage” is thomier as it means

well, lots of other  However, to
use the religious meaning of

pery, it is  meaningless

Now, I am sure someone is object-
ing that language changes over time,
and that maybe “discount” can mean
something independent of base price
and “marriage” can mean the same
thing in politics and religion. This is
true However, the linguistic nonsense
that is  on right now works pre-
cisely because these words are not cur-
rently used in this way.

It might seem extreme to call these
uses of language meaningless After
all, I know exactly what to do when I
punch debit and fork over three and a
half dimes I understand the words the
candidates say about gay  so
what is so meaningless? The nonsense

of these constructions comes precisely _

because we don’t really know what

Watch out for PEDS next Week

by Josh Green
Co/um/ziat

 

Ihadabaddreamlastnight Itwas

a cold sweat,  out in the dark-
ness for a comfort that didn’t exist.
All I wanted was a warm presence to
embrace me and assure me that ev-
erythingwouldbe allrightlyeamed
for this comfort in vain. Eventually, I
drifted back to sleep and the dream
continued.

Electoral maps Ohio was red.
Pennsyivania was blue Political strat-
egists chased me down black-and-
white checkered hallways that twisted
and narrowed. But I wanted them to
chase me I longed for Larry

Rudy Giuliani was there, dressed
like a woman,  robocalls and

rack Obama wants criminals to get

bered Sept 11.

I woke up  and could not get
backto sleep. I spenttherestof that
late nightwatchingthe4a.m.rerunof
“The O’Reilly Factor” '

You see, I have the early symp-
toms of a condition known as Post-
Election Depression Syndrome, or
PEDS PEDS will affect many citi-
zens come the ﬁfth of November. It
comes after an extreme cutoff of po-
litical commentary to the brain

Like any addiction, this one starts
with just a little taste. Someone’s peer
may pressure him into watching a
segment of “Hard ” or “Hannity
&. Colmes” The person is either en-
tertained or outraged by the segment,
feeling a brief  of euphoria.
When the person comes down, they
are left desiring more of the The

downward spiral starts from there.

The nature of how one becomes
addicted is not important This hard-
 expose is meant to highlight
what happens when an addict is
forced to quit cold  How do
people deal with a life free of election
coverage? What will people do when
they realize many of the controversies
they were forced to care about actually
don’t matter that much?

There are several ways to deal with
PEDS. The ﬁrst way is to realize that
even after the election is over, it’s not
really over. Let’s say Obama wins on
Tuesday. Serrjohn McCain would re-
spectfully concede, but manufactured
controversy will still ﬁll the airwaves

Ever hear of ACORN? Do you
know what it stands for? Me neither;
but apparentiy it is an organization
that wants individuals from urban
areas —  minorities and low-
income individuals -— to vote.

This doesn’t sitwell with many Re-
publicans, who only want low—income
voters if their ﬁrstname has one syl-
lable and their occupation can be
found in the Yellow Pages They will
blame Obama’s win on voter registra-
tion fraud perpetuated by ACORN,
which has submitted voter registra-
tion forms with names like “Mickey
Mouse” and ot:her fake identities Ap-
parentiy cartoon diaractersi haven’t
yet received the constitutional right to
vote, and  them could sway
an election.

This made-up controversy could
ﬁll weeks of airtime,  if a
situation similar to Florida in 2000 oc-
curs. If the ACORN “scandal”rnakes
news after the election, it will present
a nice, slow withdrawal for people
with PEDS, who will ﬁnally become
so disgusted with fake controversies
that they will smash their televisions,
stick their heads out of the window

and yell, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not
 to take it anymore”

But if no strange election con-
troversy artives, people will have to
look somewhere else to ﬁll the void
that election coverage once spackled
shut Many people turn to loved ones
or friends to ﬁll the gap with true love
and unconditional ﬁiendship. I don’t
recommend this. Instead, if I do end
up sufferingfromPEDS,Iwilltum
from election coverage to celebrity
news

Some famous person will expose
herself, shout an ethnic slur or adopt
a child. Real scandalous stuff Hope-

 someone will have a nervous
breakdown. Soon, everyone’s election
obsession will dissipate.

But I’rn forgetting t:he fact that the
election coverage never has to end.
After the election, there is no reason
that news organizations have to stop
covering elections. And I don’t mean
just false controversies that affected
the 2008 election. I’m saying news

organizations can look forward to,

2012.

Surely someone has started a
group to investigate the possibility of
 an exploratory committee
in order to possibly run for ofﬁce in
2012.

Granted, the Mayan calendar ends
on 2012, and many people are pre-
dicting the end of the world. Maybe
so, but until then we can comfortably
watch election coverage in the safety
of our homes Besides, if the “Palin
2012”  held at some rallies have
any credence, the end of the world
willbe scoringhigherinthepolls than

LettertotheEditor

To the Editor,

This letter is m response to Matthew Diabes’ Oct. 22, 2008 column
entitled “McCain’s campaign is based on creating fear.” I believe the ar-
ticle grossly misrepresented the tone and actions of Sen. John McCain’s
campaign. , A

It has become very clear that Sen. Barack Obama will become the
next president and that McCain will suffer defeat. Many political pundits
have pointed to this reality in claims that McCain’s campaign has be-
come increasingly negative over the past couple of weeks. The column
points to a comment made by Gov. Sarah Palin that Obama was “palling
around with terrorists” to support his claim that McCain’s campaign is
based on lies and creating fear.

Some people would rather hear about the policies of the two candi-
dates as opposed to their personal relations. But other voters, such as
myself, would like to hear about both. In my opinion, personal values
and relations are important because they inﬂuence the decisions the can-
didate will make as president. When deciding the leader of the United
States, every consideration and possibility needs to be taken into ac-
count. Just because some people don’t like to hear about certain issues
does not make the presentation of those issues negative campaigning.

McCain’s campaign, possibly to his detriment, has ignored far more
divisive issues than Obama’s relations with William Ayers. How many
times has McCain mentioned Rev. Jeremiah Wright or attacked Obama’s
views on affirmative action? Since Palin was announced as McCain’s
running mate, she has been called by many names other than the gov-
ernor of Alaska. Diabes’ column went so far as to call her a “lunatic
pet.”

McCain is an honorable man and has served his country well with the
hope of making it a better place. As a junior in college with my whole
life to look forward to, I can only hope that I- can serve my country with
the honor, respect and courage that McCain has.

To say that Pittsburgh is no
longer a simple industrial town is
a dramatic understatement. Jazz,
hailed by some as America’s an-
swer to classical music, ﬂourishes
prolifically here.

Many jazz legends including
Billy Eckstein, Billy Strayhorn,
Errol Garner and Lena Horne,
found their starts in Pittsburgh.

There are multiple organiza-
tions based in Pittsburgh that
focus on introducing younger
generations to jazz music and
supporting the jazz community.
These organizations host dozens

of jazz concerts and related pro—_

grams that go on every month.
The Manchester Craftsmen’s
Guild, a subdivision of the Man-
chester Bidwell Corp. founded
by Pitt alumnus Bill Strickland, is
dedicated to the use of visual and
performing arts to provide hope
and opportunities in the urban

~ community.

“We have activities going on
here on a regular basis, both con-
certs and educational programs,”
said Renee Govanucci, MCG
]azz’s associate producer. “Our
mission statement is to preserve,
present and promote jazz, and
we do that in a variety of ways.”

MCG ]azz’s commitment to
the preservation of jazz history
led to the creation of an archive
containing more than 300 CD re-
cordings of regional and national
performers.

Since 1987 MCG jazz has
been an important part of the
Pittsburgh jazz community and
culture, running performances
and recordings in its music hall

and educational programs that
enable students to attend con-
certs with low-priced or free tick-
ets.

It also plans a number of
other events for the jazz commu-

nity.

“We’re in the middle of two
big activities right now: our gala
[in honor of Pittsburgh’s 250th
anniversary and Manchester
Bidwell’s 40th anniversary], and a
professional development day for
area music educators,” said Amy

Constantine-Kline, MCG ]azz’s
customer relations manager.
Jazz Workshop Inc., founded

in 1973, focuses on the posi-

tive effects of music on children
and works to supplement inner-
city music education programs

through the promotion of jazz.

_ The non-proﬁt organization utilizes

“People may not have the resources

The Pittsburgh Jazz Society, established
in 1987, describes itself on its Web site as
“dedicated to the promotion, preservation

through concerts and various education

Many of these o_rganizations have phil-
anthropic aims, particularly with regard to
fostering. a love of jazz in the city’s youth
population, but they ‘also provide listening
and performing opportunities for Veteran
jazz lovers.

Despite —— or perhaps because of— the
multitude of jazz organizations within the
city, there is some discontent with the lack

of unity of the performing aspect of the

Pittsburgh jazz community, and particu-
larly with the tendency of repetitive per-
formances of older musicians at the estab-
lished venues rather than experimenting
with new music and younger artists.

“The jazz community needs to be more
open for all of us. It can be like a clique
with the samepeople performing all the
time. The community needs to broaden

Successful recruiting
takes endless effort

by Pat Mitsch
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt women’s basketball coach
Agnus Berenato calls it the triple
team.

She doesn’t use it on every
player — only the best. It can hap-
pen in an empty high school gym
or it can happen in a crowded
living room, doesn’t matter. It’s
like a full-court press, without the
pressure, of course.

It’s three Pitt coaches together
in one spot anywhere across the
country trying to recruit a teen-
ager to come and play basketball
for Pitt.

“If they’re the really big re-
cruit, I’ll make a statement and

triple team them,” said Berenato.
“You have three coaches out
on the road [recruiting] at any
one time, and that makes a huge
statement because we’re all at
your game. \We’re at no one else’s
game. That means there’s no one
else more important.”

College recruiting is an odys-
sey. It’s the one thing Berenato
thinks makes college coaches get
out of the game.

Not pressure to win, not los-
ing — scouring the country for
elite high school players, getting
to them before anyone else and
then trying to sell your univer-
sity as their'best viable option for
their future in both athletics and

academics. If it sounds like a glo-
riﬁed sales pitch that is because,
as Berenato’s noticed over the
past several years, recruits and
their families are becoming more
like shoppers.

“I think the kids today, they’re
into recruiting. They enjoy it. The
parents like it,” said Berenato.
“They want to see what you have
to offer. They’re good consum-
ers. They’re all about shopping
for the best deal.”

But what makes the best deal?
There are countless factors in
play when courting recruits: early
playing time, program history,
location, academics, coaching, fa-
cilities —— it’s an endless, dynamic

Recruiting takes time, effort and commitment. But ifs one of the
reasons Pitt landed top-recruit DeJua.n Blair, right, last year.

process that’s not ﬁnal until a
recruit signs a binding National
Letter of Intent to attend and
play for the school they decide is
best.

Every college coaching staff
must do it, and every staff must
work to make themselves and the

school they’re representing stand
out to a teenager receiving similar
pitches from 10 to 30 — maybe
more — other programs.

The key to making a lasting
impression, according to men’s

Big East champions? BCS
bowl game?

These two scenarios seemed
within reach following Pitt’s win
over Navy two weekends ago but
now have nearly vanished for all
but a few people after Pitt’s loss
to Rutgers.

Me? Weﬂ, I’m one of those

C few.

It’s the nature of the game,
but it’s frustrating to watch a
team be praised after upsetting
a ranked team on national televi-
sion one day, only to be shunned
after losing a shootout at home a
few weeks later.

Rutgers came to Pittsburgh
hungry on Saturday. The players
came in looking for statistics, and
the team entered searching for a
win in the Big East.

It had just defeated Connecti-
cut and lost two close games at

fans, don't give

West Virginia and Cincinnati a
couple of weeks earlier.

The Panthers were riding high
on a ﬁve-game winning streak.
LeSean McCoy looked unstop-
pable, Bill Stull was clicking, and
the defense even started to play
better.

It was the perfect situation of
one team overlooking the other.

You can’t blame Pitt for that.
It happens all of the time. That’s
part of the beauty of college
football. Just in the beginning of
October, the Panthers were on
the other side of the situation
when they upset South Florida in
Tampa, Fla.

So a 54-34 loss to Rutgers? It
really isn’t that crazy.

Teams can attempt to blame
ugly losses on anything from
poor playing conditions to the al-
ways amusing referees. But when
it comes down to it, the better
team that day always wins. Unfor-
tunately for Pitt fans, Rutgers was

up yet

better this past Saturday.

But how can you know Pitt can
still capture the Big East and the
accompanying BCS bowl game?

With Stull’s status still unde-
cided for the game against Notre
Dame and the rest of the season,
there’s no question why many have
doubted just how far the team can
go. But much of Pitt’s offensive
success this season has come on

the ground. The Panthers know~s

this. Every team they’ve played
knew this. Still, McCoy has con-
tinuously put up more than 100
total yards each game and has
rushed for 14 touchdowns. He

is looking like the Heisman Tro-"‘

phy candidate that every Pitt fan
wants to see. He’s the total pack-
age and the true staple of the
Panthers’ offense.

As for the air game, Stull has

not ofﬁcially been ruled out of"

any contests this season. Even if
backup quarterback Pat Bostick
needs to come in, it’s not the end

Stull in good health, but center Houser out for year

by Kyle Craig
Staﬁ’ Writer

There is a possibility that quar-
terback Bill Stull will be available to
start Saturday when the Panthers
travel to Notre Dame.

Stull, who needed to be carted
off the ﬁeld during Pitt’s 54-34
loss to Rutgers, has received a
more positive medical evaluation
than the nature of his departure
indicated. After spending Satur-
day night in the hospital, Stull was
released after preliminary tests in-
dicated he suffered a concussion
and a “stinger” — and not a severe
neck injury.

According to Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt, Stull observed practice

on Sunday and is having his status‘

closely monitored.

“Everything we’ve

received

from Billy and everything that
we’ve received from the doctors
has been nothing but positive,”
said Wannstedt during a Monday
press conference.

Wannstedt didn’t name a start-

Dame game, putting that decision
off until later in the week. If Stull
is unable to play, sophomore Pat
Bostick will start in his place.

Changes

The quarterback position isn’t
the only spot facing the prospect
of a new starter. ‘

Junior Robb Houser’s season-
ending ankle  leaves the
Panthers with a vacancy at center.
Early indications were that C.]. Da-
vis would move from left guard to
center and ﬁfth-year senior Domi-
nic W/illiams would take Davis’
spot.

But Warmstedt said the depth
chart hasn’t been ﬁnalized and that
the coaching staff is in the process
of evaluating the situation.

“W/e’ll make a determination
on what combination of players
gives us the best chance to win this
week,” said Warmstedt. “As to who
is moving where or who is going
to move to guard or tackle, it’s too
early to talk about that right now.”

‘ii § . 3.

t.,

- ‘-3-’! t. O 1-.

\While not guaranteeing any
speciﬁc roster moves, Warmstedt
indicated that there might be a
shakeup at some other positions.
The Panthers could be looking for
a new punt returner after current
return man and cornerback Aaron
Berry fumbled away one of Pitt’s
best opportunities for a comeback
during last Saturday’s game.

“We’re evaluating that, too,” said
Warmstedt of a possible change in
the return game. “We’ve deﬁnitely
put the ball on the ground a few
times, and we need to ﬁx that.”

\Wannstedt said that cornerback
Ricky Gary and safety  Fields
will continue to get some playing
time on defense after seeing the
ﬁeld brieﬂy against Rutgers.

Finding the endzone

Few expected last weekend’s
contest against Rutgers to become
an offensive slugfest. But once the
game turned into a shootout, Pitt
relied on halfback LeSean McCoy
to keep up with the game’s torrid

Iw  it s~._9..

  
      
 
   
   
   
    
   

 

       

scoring pace.

McCoy responded with 180
yards of total offense and a career-
high four rushing touchdowns.
Now, seven games into the season,
McCoy has already matched his
rushing touchdown total from last
year with 14 scores.

Through his 19-game career,
McCoy has accumulated 29 to-
tal touchdowns, which gives him
ﬁve more touchdowns than the

legendary Tony Dorsett scored in

his ﬁrst two collegiate seasons. Sat-
urday also marked the sophomore
tailback’s fourth consecutive game
with more than 100 yards rushing.

Wannstedt vs. Weis

Pitt’s last meeting with Notre
Dame was on Sept. 3, 2005, at
Heinz Field. The game marked the
collegiate head coaching debut of
both Dave Wannstedt and Irish
coach Charlie Weis. The Panthers
entered that contest ranked 23rd in
the nation but fell to the unranked
Irish, 42-21.

DEPRESSED? SMOKING MARIJUANA?

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are recruiting people ages
14 to 25 fora medication research study. We are seeking people who feel depressed
and smoke mariiuona. Participants will receive an evaluation that inciudes a physical
exam, study medication, and treatment for three months at no cost. »

Participants will be compensated after each visit.

All cells are conﬁdential.

.1 ~866~222-3954.

Since then, Warmstedt hi;
compiled a record of 21-21 with
no bowl appearances. Weis, on the
other hand, has a record of 27-17
with two bowl appearances.

Both teams enter the game
with 5-2 records. Notre Dame 
fresh off a victory against a win-
less Washington team, while Pitt
will look to remain undefeated on
the road this season and rebound
from its homecoming loss to Rut-
gers.

After giving up six passing
touchdowns to Rutgers quarter-
back Mike Teel, the Panthers will
face an Irish offense that is ranked
20th in the nation in passing yard,--
age per game. Warmstedt said that
he expects Notre Dame to have
a balanced attack but added it
wouldn’t surprise him if they at-
tempted to air the ball out

“Notre Dame may throw it
60 times this week  that’s what
they’ve been doing,” said Wannst—
edt. “They have been throwing it,
and I think their quarterback is get-
ting better.”

of the world. Bostick entered a game this
past Saturday in which the Panthers were
chasing their opponent from the end of
the first quarter.

Down by 10 points, Bostick threw an in-
terception on an inefficient play call .— se-
riously, why make your quarterback roll out
to his weak side and throw across his body
on a third-and—one? He then rebounded by
leading a desperate offense in the team’s
last two possessions, going 4 of 8 with 32
yards in just more than six minutes.

Bostick was a highly touted recruit com-
ing out of high school and is expected to
lead the team after Stull graduates. He’s still
young and he’s still learning, but Pitt fans
should still have faith in him if he’s called
upon.in any of Pitt’s upcoming games.

As for the defense, it was making big
plays from the Iowa game to the Navy
game. In its three away games prior to play»
ing Rutgers, Pitt had not given up more.

than 24 points. Linebacker. Scott McKillop
continues to gain ground as a serious con-
tender as Big East Defender of the Year.
If the team approached the game against
Rutgers to defend the pass more than the
run, the secondary might not have gotten
as burned as it did.

I’m not trying to scrutinize every prob-
lem and rationalize solutions with this Pan-
thers team.'I’m just trying to put things
into perspective. 3

Pitt still has games against the two cur-

rent leaders of the Big East (West Virginia
and Connecticut). If the Panthers look at
these matchups one game at a time, the Big
East championship and a BCS bowl game
don’t seem so unrealistic.

So, before everybody gets crazy about
the fall of Pitt football after a bad loss, they
should step back and take a deep breath.
Everything will be all right.

New forms of Contact
helping coaches recruit

Recruiting, page 15

cruiting players as early in their careers
as possible, without breaking any NCAA
regulations —- a coach can only contact
a recruit during certain windows — and
keeping on them once they do.

“There’s a number of ways that you
find out about players. Hopefully the first
opportunity is through the eye, seeing him
at a camp or a game or an AAU [Ama-
teur Athletic Union]

a bunch of calls with somebody close to
him, whether it’s an AAU coach or a high
school coach.”

The AAU is a non—profit national or-
ganization that sponsors athletic events in
many sports across the country.

It’s especially prevalent in basketball
recruiting because nearly every top recruit
will play and travel in the summer for an
i AAU team —— like

event,” said Herrion,  

. who recruited current

Pitt basketball play-
ers Jermaine Dixon,
Dwight Miller and
Ashton Gibbs as
well as Pitt commit
Dante Taylor, a na-
tional top-25 recruit.
“The way the system

expedited, it’s more Tom

the New York Gau-
chos or the D.C. As-
sault —— to compete
at a high level and
hope to get noticed
by scouts at tourna-
ments or camps.

The main reason
Herrion said the re-
cruiting process has
been expedited is the
genesis of Internet

“You do a lot of
leg work, a lot of
phone work in terms of making contact
with the coach of a young man if we have
interest,” he said. “W/e’ll follow up with

such as Rivals and

You have to find the one thing.
VVho's the key person? Is it

watching him. He compared me a lot to Ja-
son Taylor, and I liked that role. I’ve always
admired Jason Taylor. That clicked.”

Not every coach has such clout, though,
and can’t throw around names like Taylor,
an ,all—pro. NFL defensive end. Berenato
certainly couldn’t when she and assistant
Jeff Williams ﬁrst inherited the Pitt wom-
en’s basketball program in 2003 after a
three—win season. '

“We truly were out every day,” she said.
“I mean, sometimes we’d get up at 4 a.m.,

do a school in the morning and then ﬂy
and be somewhere at night. We had 10 or
11 early signings we went after, and we
didn’t get one commitment.”

So Berenato went with what brought
her to Pitt - a family mentality. Show a
player support, show them that you be-
lieve in them, and they’ll believe in you.
That was enough to get twoplayers named
Marcedes Walker and Shavonte Zellous —
arguably the two best players in program
history — to come to Pitt, now. a respected

program and NCAA Tournament ﬁxture.
.“Now it’s different. We have some play-
ers,” said Berenato. “We knew we were go-
ing to turn ‘the program around. We looked
at you and told you, ‘You could be the best

player in the world.’ I look back and think, i

‘What was I thinking?’ Now six years later,
it’s really hard.

“You have to find the one thing. Who’s
the key person? Is it the mom? Is it the
dad? Is it the AAU coach or high school
coach? It’s unbelievable.”



“The age‘ of communication now,”
it’s so instant,” he said. “There’s less un-_
knowns nowadays because of the Internet

I and the exposure that kids get. It’s so in-

stant how much information is out there
on a particular young man. It’s a different
generation. They’re exposed to so many

, different things. There’s so much instant

gratiﬁcation for kids today. They want ev-
erything yesterday. There’s no patience in
the recruit industry.” V

The Internet wave is the biggest in
football recruiting.

Because of obvious weather restrictions
and risk of injury, no football recruit plays
year-round like basketball players can. To
get noticed outside of their high school
games, they can attend scouting combines,

often sponsored by shoe companies like

Nike, along with Scout or Rivals. That’s
where Pitt found out about defensive end
Jabaal Sheard, at a Nike/ Rivals combine in-
Miami in 2006. A

“They watched me run, and [former Pitt
assistant coach _Charlie] Partridge saw me
run, and he seemed like a real cool dude.
Then the process started,” said Sheatd.

“He would come to my house, show me a ,

lotof interest, call me on the phone. I felt

_ like I was a real interest,’ like Pitt could use
_ me there.”

That wasn’t the end of the process for
Sheard, by any means. As much as Inter-
net services inﬂuence recruiting decisions

_now, personal communication is still the

key. Pittcoach Dave Wannstedt, hailed for
his recruiting prowess and bringing in con-
sistently strong recruiting classes since he

was hired in 2005, came to Sheard’s Holly- ‘
_ wood, Fla., home andimpressed his entire

family. \

“My mom seemed to like him,” said

Sheard. “Plus he was the Dolphins coach,
and I’m a Dolphins fan, so I grew up
