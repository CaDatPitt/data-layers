Seven Educators-Issue Stern Warnings;,

Reafﬁrm American Concept of Learning

Theconclusions of a delegation of seven'American Uni-
versity heads who touredeRussian higher educational plants
this summer have been published in a 15,00(L Word report,
which reaffirms the traditional American concept of higher
learning, yet issues some stern warnings. ‘

The group, headed by Chancellor Litchﬁeld,,_traveled un-

er terms of an agreement reached: .

last January between the United
States and Russia forexchange
in cultural, technical, and educa-
tional ﬁelds.

The educators feel that the
short-run efficiency of Soviet edu-
cation may prove to be a long-
term handicap in the Communist
struggle for world determination.

In‘ sacriﬁcing broad intellect-
ual development in favor of in-
tensive indoctrination, the Soviet
Union is severely limiting.’
growth by stiﬂing individual
creativity. _ l ‘

Themost signiﬁcant aspect of
higher education "in ‘the Soviet
Uniom the report stated, is the‘
prestige it enjoys and the support‘

“it can command.

The prestige can be measured

by the ﬁrst-rank importance it is

_, given by industrial and bureaucrat

alike; by the fact that attendance
at a university or technical "insti-
tute is a prized opportunity; and
‘by the high prestige enjoyed by
faculty members of Russia~n/uni-
versities
The American educators noted
further evidence_ of the Soviet
commitment to higher education
in the size and extensiveness of ’
library collections.

Still another factor cited. by the
group is the financial assistance
made available to Soviet students.
The ‘report stated that more than
80‘ per cent of the students are
assisted ﬁnancially in whole or in
part. _

The American educators, how-
ever, regard as completely unac-
ceptable the basic premise of So-
viet education which regards edu-
cation as an _“instrumentality for
the training of persons who will
serve the deﬁned objectives of the
State.”

The educators reported they

considered as deﬁnite disadvant-

ages these further important‘ as- T

pects of Soviet education:

A prescribed curricula set for
all institutions by the Ministiy
' of Education, which reduces the
role of the individual professor.
Serious gapsin subject matter,
which ﬁnd little'or no place given
to /such subjects as ‘economics,
psychology, sociology, and an-
thropology. 
Curtaiiment of student develop-

-ment by the rigid curriculum,.

which denies the student the op-
portunity to rangewidely in- the
development of‘. his talents and
discourages personal growth 'and
improvement.

Senator Gore

Guest of WPDU=~'

Senator Albert Gore of Tenn-
essee was the guest of the William
Pitt Debate Union Wednesday
afternoon at an informal reception
in the Student Union.

The Democratic senator was in
town to make a political speech in
McKeesport. Gore has been a con-
gressman since 1939. _

The senator visited the debaters
in connection with his forthcom-
ing trip to the Geneva Conference
on Nuclear Disarmament -which
relates to thevcurrent debate topic.
Gore also visited the School of

Public and International Affairs‘:

 

overture by Wolf-Ferrari. The
overture is an inconsequential lit-
tle thing which in private life in-
\ troduces a triﬂing opera; the bright
performance here set the mood ’
‘perfectly for an informal concert.
Next was the “Prelude in E’_’
Iy Bach, which turned out to be
.he high ‘spot of ‘the evening.
This piece was scored originally
asa ﬂashy perpetual motion for
unaccompanied ‘violin-

The ten violinists of the Sym-
phonetta stood and played this
whirlwind in shimmering unison,
‘while the other instruments ﬁlled
in the harmonies which Bach had.
chosen to leave to the imagination.

The reason for the success of

this piece was that Kritz had no .'

hand in the molding of the per-
formance; the ten ﬁddlers know
their parts thoroughly and the
lower parts were purely routine.
Such was not the case, un-
. happily, in the two following se-
lecticns, the pieces de resistance
of the program. Beethoven’s

First Sym’phony is wonderfully

' adaptable to performance by a
small group, and the result
should have been a perfectly p

' transparent, delicately detailed
performance.

Evidently the piece had not been
very well rehearsed, for the phras-
ings were harsh and graceless, the
orchestra was not in tune; and the
rhythms were anemic. In all, the

l

performance was loveless and dis— —'

appointingly routine.

‘ Routine’ would hardly be the
word to describe the Tchaikowsky
Violin‘ Concerto, second and third
‘movements, in which the concert-
master, Samuel Thaviu, appeared
as soloist. ' '

' Fortunately, the inspiration 
the composer was able to carry the
piece, for the orchestra was thor-
oughly apathetic and no two bars
were played at quite the same
speed. Plaudits, however, must go

;to Mr. Thaviu, who handled the

" difficult solo part nicely in the
face of such adversity.

‘ The remainder of the program

 

l'.‘an't decide‘ what business
would suit you best?

_ Maybe you should look into the
possibilities offered by a life
insurance sales career. Among
its many advantages are the
freedom of being in business for.
yourself, and no ceiling on your
earnings. ‘

The head of our campus unit will
be glad to fill you in on the details.

lege is expanding into a four year program.

Biddle Sees Expansion

ToFour- Yea rProgram

With the celebration of its thirty-ﬁrst birthday, Johns-
town Center officially became J ohnstown College.

The College is expanding into a four-year program with
Dr. Theodore W. Biddle as its president, V .

At present, tvi/0-year courses are available in mining and
engineering, teacher. training, business administration, liberal

arts and general sciences. A limit-9

ed three-year course is offered in
pre-medical, pre-dental and some
liberal arts courses.

The College plans to move cau-
tiously toward a three and ﬁnally
a four-year course. However, this
will not be practical until some
500 or 600 students are enrolled.

Present full-time enrollment is
about 300 students. About 225 stu-
dents are taking part—time work.
A gradual increase in enrollment
is expected within the next ﬁve
years.

Status of the College was
bolstered by the appointment of
an Advisory Board consisting of
eighteen outstanding community
leaders. Walter W. Krebs, pub-
lisher of the Johnstown Tribune-
Democrat, is chairman.

The board meets four times a
year in regular sessions but is
subject-to call at any time by the
president. A meeting is scheduled
for this month.

Twenty-four full-time instruc-
tors and seven part-time instruc-
tors comprise the College faculty.
Recently personnel have been

added to teach courses in eco-
nomics, philosophy and ‘psychol-
ogy. ’

President Biddle has been with
the University ever since his grad-
uation in 1929. He was appointed
acting dean of men in 1940 an
dean of Men in 1942. “

Biddle holds‘ a BS degree in
Business Administration and a
Master of Education degree. He
also has an honorary doctorate in
education from Waynesboro Col-
lege. , '

—with full pay—deals with advanced
techniques and ‘new concepts in elec-

and practical laboratory applications.

When Jim and his colleagues return to
their companies, they’ll review major
engineering projects. This will assure
theibest use of equipment for current
engineering, as well as for expected new
developments in communications.

‘To Rog]: the Stadium
Editor, The Pitt News ‘

Let’s rock the stadium! ,Let’s do
something to help Pitt beat Notre

Dame on. Saturday} November 8,

l95_8. . 

In all my years attending foot-
ball games" at Pitt Stadium, the
general public and the students

‘ alike are lethargic "and deﬁnitely

- unenthusiasticain the-(support of

the,_team, which'they pay money

to watch. , ‘ _

In other cities the students and
spectators, together, sing and cheer
spontaneously and proudly for the
support of the team which repre-
sents them as a general spectator;
This occurs even though most of

A the spectators never attended the
particular school of the city in
which they live. - “

I think it is about time that
Pitt Stadium spectators do some-

thing in response to this appeal-

’Maybe the University will pass
out _cards to each spectator on
which is imprinted University
songs~ and cheers; maybe the
cheerleaders should spread along
the .entire ‘cinder track and lead
everyone in a unified song or
cheer. ’ ‘
Maybe there should.be radio,
television and newspaper appeal
urging the spectators to co-op-
erate; _maybe’,,_the Pitt Panthers

' should lead the entire stadium in.

Whatever is done is not for me to
decide, but ‘something should be
done.,Let’s have someone do some-
thing. - \
Let’st;rock thestadium on No-
vember.8, 1958 and do something
for the Pitt team, at each home
game from now on. _

“Owl” Situation Poor’

According to Reader

Editor, The Pitt News, 
I believe the Owl situation here

at’ Pitt is disgusting. A school's
yearbook is supposed to be a «com-

" posite of school functions and..ac-

tivities. ,, ., .. I  -

Many students, don’t know~ that
organizations on the Pitt campus
which are recognized and sanc-
tioned by the University are re-
quired- to pay‘ for their own pic-
ture in the OW1.\

‘Another serious problem is the '

cost of the yearbook. Last year
only 1500 books were sold because
of its high cost. Most Universities
give the yearbook to all students
through their payment of an ac-
tivities fee. We pay $48’ a year,
never- know where it goes, and
then the University has the nerve
to ask us for $6.00 for our own
yearbook. ‘ -

now under consideration are de-
plo'rable and demoralizing. The
word racketeer is not to be used
in any .derogatorily suggestive

manner concerning our great uni-

versity.

I suggest that the Post Gazette

either print a public apology for
_their hastily written, issue con-

fusing article, or remove their

newspaper vending machines from

Amdur Plays

The biggest dive since the stock
market crash of 1929 hit the ranks
of the Yogis this week as Millard
Amdur ﬁnally fell‘ off the high
pedestal he has been sporting all
year. _

With a crash heard ’round th
universe, Amdur descended from
a close second to a distant fourth.
His record of. 4-8 was the worst
of the Yogis last week and drop-
ped his season total below the
.6(l0 mark. : , . _
are the

 

player and the coach, who were
represented‘ by John Guzik and
Steve Petro, respectively, this past
week. Guzik guessed like an All-
American and came up with a 7-5
mark, and Petro performed equal-
ly as well.

David Breakstone wasn’t feel-
ing too good last week when he
made his selections, so he, too,

and were the victors by the score

Use Wide Open Game‘

The Orangemen do a lot‘of_pass-'
ing and play a wide open game,
using flankers and split ends from
‘a straight wing or_ slot-T forma-
tion. The line is always. unbalanc-
ed to the right.

Coach Floyd (Ben) Schwartz-
walder, who is in his tenth sea-
son at Syracuse, has a one and
two record against the Panthers.
He has alltogetherwon 47 and,
lost 82 with two __ties. His teams
have won two Lambert Trophies,
emblematic of Eastern football
supremacy, in ‘ 1952 and 1956,
and both teams competed in
bowl games.

The team Pitt lost to last sea-
son has 17 menstill around with
six of them returning regulars.
Last year Syracuse pulled an up-
set, 24-21 at the Stadium. -

Strong at Quarterback
_ The Orange are strongest at

merman, a three year regular, and
veteran Dan Fogarty manipulate’.
__Zimmerman has completed 53 per
