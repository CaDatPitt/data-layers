In 1899, Dr. Werder helped to“ [or-

The football game with State Col-

record crowd of Pitt graduates, judg-
ing by the advance mail order sale.
As was the case with the W. & J.
game, the entire lot of reserved seats
for the Thanksgiving Day classic was
"sold to the alumni and students of.

Pitt and State a week or so before the *

.-even heavier than for the W. &* ‘J.
game from this source a.nd it is as-
sured thatthe crowd will pack every
nook and corner of Forbes Field.

Pitt alumni will be here from all
parts of the country, with the double
purpose of seeing the football game
and‘ also renewing acquaintances with
old Pittsburgh friends, It is an occa-
sion that comes only once a. year and
as many of the grads as possibly can
get back for it. The Pitt alumni, as
usual, ..will bein the right wing of the
‘stands, while the" State ‘crowd will be

Carnegie Tech’s football eleven to the
tune of 17 to 7, but only after a gril-
ling, hard-fought struggle, marked by
several injuries; Tech led at the end
of the ﬁrst half by 7 points, Which
were scored against the varsity subs.
At the beginning of the third-quarter

_ the world-heaters were all in the line-

up. They rammed and passed their
way to two touchdowns and a ﬁeld
goal for a total of 17 points.

The Panthers received the surprise
of their lives when Phil Marshall
scored‘ the first touchdown of the
game. It was a deserved score, for
Warner’s boys had been outplayed up
to the time when Davies, Morrow and

Mccracken were sent in for Aschman,;

sued, during which one policeman was
knocked unconscious, and ﬁve students
arrested. The coppers were ﬁnally
forced to draw their revolvers, and the
crowd dispersed. It is unfortunate
that such riotous incidents should
take place at every meeting of the
two student bodies. '

The second hall’ opened with the
first team on the ﬁeld, with the ex-
ception of the cripples, Captain De-
Hart and Harmon and Mervis. The
lighter Tech team could not stop Hast-
ings, Davies _& Co., and the third

period was not over before Pitt ‘had

one touchdown and was within strik-
ing distance of a second, due to a
fumble by Moon, the Tech punter.

called.

The first quarter ended without
either side scoring. It was in the sec-
ond period that Tech scored its touch-
down. The Warnerites had worked

the ball down to within striking dis-"

tance of Tech’s goal, and Gus A'sch-
man tried for a placement kick. The
shoot was low, and to the right, and
Captain Marshall intercepted the ball

. on his own 7-yard line. He eluded
several would-be tacklers, and raced
93ya.rds for the score. It was a.

magniﬁcent run and one of the fea-
tures of the day. Fletcher kicked the
resultant goal, and the score was 7
too. V , g

It was at this juncture that Davies,
Morrow and Mccracken went into the
line-up. Our defense strengthened for
the remainder of the..~peri'od and there
was‘ no more scoring. Davies inter-

cepted a forward, pass near the end

Davies kicked the goal, tying
the score. Warner's boys thenstarted
to launch a new attack, which resulted
in one more touchdown and a pretty
ﬁeld goal by Davies from the 27-yard
line. This ended the scoring for the
afternoon, with the varsity holding a
safe lead of 10 points.

It was a thrilling, spectacular con-
test throughout, and was bitterly con-
tested. Tech played as if their lives‘
depended on the outcome and, when a
team enters the ﬁeld with such a.
spirit, it is a hard aggregation to de-
feat. ‘Warner would have liked to use
his secondstring men for the entire
game, but he deemed it necessary,
and rightly so, to use his best bets to
defeat the wearers of the Plaid. Tech

played a ﬁghting game, but was out- '

THE VARSlTY' DlD IT

Even though Tech was leading by seven points and was carrying on a
well-planned" and smashing attack, somehow or other, we refused to worry.
No doubt it was the knowledge that on the bench was the fighting Varsity,
which, in spite of itocrippled condition we felt was able to go in at any
time and administer the knockout, The offensive launched by Davies, Mor-
row and Mccrackcn when they entered the fray late in the second period.
gave us full assurance that Pitt would win. What the entire Varsity did!
in the last two periods is history, but it is indicative of a healthy spirit in
the Panther team. The men all have their minds on the big battle with
State Thanksgiving‘ Day. After the gruellin encounter with Penn just a
week ago, it is not to be pxpecteld that a team could be kept on edge fou

twelve days intervening between two of the biggest games of the year.

We are perfectly satisﬁed that any kind of a victory was won over Techi.
Defeat would have been humiliating. snatching a game away from our
city rival after they thought they might win makes the victory just a little
more pleasant. '

THEY DO US AN UNJUSTICE
Certain so-called oporting editors in Pittsburgh this year zoom to be
entirely and unjustly out of sympathy with tho Univcnalty of Pittsburgh
and tho Pitt football team. In no year since “Pop” Warner came to coach‘
Pitt has the team been more in need of full support of the papers to create
a favorable attitude on the part of the Pittsburgh public. «o 8tlll, these afore-

‘ aid wrltoro have been persistent In their crlticlom not only of the team but

of the Pm student rootero as well. One of these writers, In his play by play
account of the Tech game, said that the Pitt rootoro quit cold when the
Pantboru were behind and showed only the faintest dividonoo of cheering

lumen Andy Hastings went ovqr for the first touchdown.

if this writer were cpeaklng the truth the criticism would be entirely
justified, but the cheering of the students up to that time does not bear out

football team are at their best form in -a crisis, when all efforts are pointed
toward the winning of a "particular game. In can of last Saturday's game'-

- jeiws Big Three in the Back-

dﬁeld Playing Their Last
H Game '

The hardest schedule a Pitt team
ever undertook is about to come to a
close and, judging from indications, it
is to end with the greatest battle of
the whole array. Every Thanksgiv-
ing State comes here, primed for a
battle, but this year they are loaded
for bear. At the beginning of this
season, Hugo B_ezd.ek had at his dis-
posal enough letter men to form a
coupleiof teams and the performances
of his men, thus far, prove that he
liasmade the most of -his "opportuni-
ties. . ,

. If -we try to .dope this game out, it
looks_a1l_ Istate, but oft goes the dope
awry. The Nlttany men beat. Penn
10-0, and Penn beat us. But that
makes no never mind. The strength
of the Pitt team can’t be measured in
points. War-ner’s men play’ their
team; the greater the occasion, the
greater their performance. We call
atention to how the dope pointed when
we played W. & J.

g -If we- take the State-team, man for
man, it throws fear into our hearts.
There -is not a. man in the, line-up
that is not a headliner. From end to
end, Bezdek’s men will look something
like this: Higgins, Henry, Osborn,
Conover, Ranch, Cubbage and Brown.
That's a line. Perhaps’ we will out-
weigh them a few pounds to theman,
but they are all experienced. Outside
of Dartmouth, no opponent of State's
has been able to do much with those
seven men. On paper, the Pitt line
takes second place, but it must be re-
membered that the Panther first de
fense has been steadily improving
with every game. Penn had a power-
ful attack and so had VV. & J., but

L
r,

outcome would have been.

For Tech, Marshall was the best
ground-gainer. He was‘ decidedly
hard to stop, once he got under way,
and, time‘ after time, he circled our
ends for good gains. Loomis, the
Plaid fullback, Baldwin and Fletcher
played stellar ball, while Wittrner and
Godden put up a ﬁne game at the wing
positions.

With honors thus even in the line)
we ﬁgure that the bucks will be
passed to ' the backﬁeld. Now, we_
come. No doubt State has a, wonder-l
ful offensive. That attack has netted
quite a few victories. It is hard to’
tell just what men will makeup‘
Bezdekls backﬁeld. Robb, Beck, I-Iess,l
Way, Williams, Snell and Haines are;
all available. Joe Leightner has just
been in'capa'citated, but thatshould not
work any great havoc with St-ate’s
chances. Charlie Way has caused Pitt
no end’ of trouble in the games he has
played at Forbes Field, while Robb, by
his efforts, has Pitt to respect and
fear his ability.

Against this crowd we offer Hast-
ings, Morrow, Davies and either De-
If “Ca.p’n Jimmy”
is able, he will surely be in there to
end his glorious career in a ﬁtting
manner. We base our hopes on the
backﬁeld. With Jimmy in..there, to
run the team, things should move
along a litlo more smoothly, but, at
any rate, the attack looks good. It’s
a bet that Andy, Jimmy, and Jim,
playing their last game, will show the
way. Then, too, we'll stake quite a

living coach. If the stuff is there,
Pop’s ﬁne Italian hand will bring it to
light and, if he goes the limit, it is
not likely that Pitt backers will be dis-
appointed.

It would bea glorious‘ achievement .

to beat State this year. Warner has
not had at his disposal this year ma-
terial to equal that of past years, but
he has developed a great team. In-
juries have played hob all year, but
the crippled list is not likely to be ‘so
long for the ﬁnal game.

It's‘ a toss-up—-anybody’s game. Two
greater ﬁghting teams have never en-
tered the arena. to do battle; Behind
it all there have never been greater
master minds to direct the battle than
Warner and Bezdek. And, on the
ﬁeld, De-Hart and ‘Higgins to lead
the forces. A battle‘ ﬁt for the gods.

Let ’er go.

Holleran, the Freshman captain and
quarterback, was the individual star of
the opening game with Bellefonte.
Hendrian and Byers also showed con-
siderable class in this ‘contest. The
Bellefonte team was not in the same
(lass as the Freshmen and were un-
able to offer any serious opposition to
the Cubs.

In their next game, which was
played at Kiski, the Yearlings played
a._ very inferior game, though the game
put up by Kiski was just enough bet-
ter to give them the game. Both
teams scored as a result of gathering
up fumbles. The failure of Hendrian
to boot the oval over the cross bar
was the deciding factor, which gave

should not be censured for this, as the
ﬁeld was very slimy, and thus ham-
pered his kicking, as well as the free
movement of both elevens. Hendrian
was the individual star of this game.

Indiana Normal was beaten by the
'count of 18 to 6. The,Freshmen had
several men out of this game. But
this fact gave an opportunity to sev-
eral subs to show what they could do.
"One of these was Sacklowsky, who
played at tackle, and’ was‘ the indi-
vidual star in the line. He made one
of the scores when he blocked a punt
back of the line and dropped on it for
a touchdown. Anderson was given his
chance in this game, and came through
very well. Clark was_injected into
this fray, and played so well that he
-finished the year as a regular guard.
Edgar also played a dandy game.

The'Cubs' defeated the Penn State
Freshmen by the score of 7 to" 0 at
State College. This was the ﬁrst de-
feat suffered by a yearling team at
State, since the ﬁrst year rule went
into effect. A tie game was played
once previously with the Pitt Fresh-
men of 1917. Hendrian was the in-
dividual star of this fray, and sur-
prised the natives of Mount Nittany.
They stated that he played the best
game ever seen of an opposing player
against the State yearlings. Holleran,
the Fresh skipper, played throughout
this contest with a broken bone in one
foot. Williams‘ and Hartnett returned
to the line-up, after being out since the
opening game. _

The West Virginia Reserves were
trimmed by the count of 41 to 7. Their
score was given to them by a techni-
cality. The kick-off went over the

Reserve player for a touchdown. Hol-
leran and Edgar were both out of this
game and witnessed the fray from the
sidelines. Hendrian was the stellar
performer, and ra.n the team very well
from quarterback. Williams, Sac-
klowsky and Clawson, all played good
games on the line. ,
In their ﬁnal clash with the Tech
Plebes on Saturday they came through
mightily. They trimmed the Tartan
ﬁrst year team by the count of 39 to 0.
Hendrian, ably assisted by Hewitt "and

NEXT SPRINE

Now that the football season is
about over, the track athletics have
turned their attention to the indoor
meets. The cross-country team has
been at work for sometime and the
men on it are getting in shape for
the winter campaign. ‘ Harry Gow,
manager, and Red Wiegel,.captain,
are turning their attention to what
they hope to be the best season the
University has ever had. Of last
year’s letter men, Frank Shea, pres-
ent National A. A. U. quarter mile

Wieged are back for ,the track
events and Curry, Thornton and
Harman will form a neucleus for

school. Potter, Graham, Bovard, Da-

of the ﬁrst half.

 

It was an afternoon that would have
cheered the heart of any old Roman

the gridiron or on, there was a battle
of some kind going on.

 

It sure was the visitors’ game, all

then on, it was different.

Holleran,. Hendrian. Hewitt, Edgar,
Williams and Clawson have been
spoken of as‘ sure varsity ﬁrst-string
men next year. But, there are many
others who will do a lot of ﬁghting to
get a regular varsity position.

The remark has often been made
that “The Pitt team will be supreme
after this season,” and it is’ due solely
to the strength of this yearling eleven,

Athletic relations between the
University of Pittsburgh and Penn-

sylvania State College can be traced,

back to the early‘ nineties. Seldom
have relations between two rival
colleges been so friendly as they
have been between these two institu-
tions. ‘

The rivalry that exists between‘

Pitt -and State today has developed

only with the growth of the Uni-

versity. In the old W. U.‘ P. days,
while games were played yearly.
mostly at State -College, the State
teams were much superior to those
-of’W. U. P.. Penn State in those
days ranked -with the best in the
country, while. W. ‘U. P. was regard-
ed as one of the little colleges.
Pitt’s or W. U. P.’s ‘great team
was in 1904. This team was cap-
tained by “Joe” Thompson. They

‘had gone through the season without

being scored upon up to the Penn
State game on Thanksgiving. In
spite of this great record States was
picked to win, but it was VVup’s
year. The ﬁnal score was 21 to 5,
State's only touchdown, the only
score against W. U. P. that year,
coming -w-i-thin the last few minutes
of playing after; W. U. P.'had rushed
in ﬁve or six -«scrubs, From that
time on the games were hard fought
and keen rivalry bégan to develop
between the two schoo-ls. In 1908 the
name Western University of Penn-
sylvania was changed to University
of Pittsburgh and the intense rivalry
between Pitt and State became tra-
ditional.

Penn State’s last triumph came in
1912, when they literally walked over
Pitt, 38 to 0. As he walked off the
ﬁeld, the renowned "‘Pete” Manthe,
one of ,the greatest backs State ever
produced, remarked that that trounc-
ing would hold Pitt for a whi.‘;e, but
he was a poor prophet and State has
never won a game since.

While football relations were the
earliest developed between" the two
schools, for ‘the past few years they
ha.ve met regularly in six branches
of competitive athletics, football,
track, basket ball, baseball, wrestling
and ,tennis. While athletics of all
kinds had reached 'an earlier stage
of development at State, yet today
the competition in, all of these
branches, with the possiblie exception
of wrestling, -is close and the rivalry
intense.

Two basket ball games are played
each year, one at State and one at
Pitt. While -baseball was maintain-
ed .at the University, return games
were played with one another,-Pitt
often playing two at State as a part
of their commencement program.
The track teams meet in a dual
meet every year at State at com-
mencement. In addition Penn State
is represented in the Pitt Inter-Col-
liegiates and both are members of
the Inter-Collegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America, the
leading inter-collegiate organization
for track athletics in the -country.
Penn State‘, which always has one
of the best wrestling teams in the
country, seldom has any difficulty
in beating the Panthers on the mat.

These thi s have just been men-
tione-d to s ow the wide scope of
the Athletic ‘relations between Pitt
and State.-  no desire to’ be-
little the. traditional rivalry of Pitt

and W. & J.,"_it may safely be said

CRDSS CIIUNTITY MEET WITH
TECH ,FAl.l.S THRUUITTI

Last Saturday morning a cross-
country run was held with Tech.
(Through a misunderstanding as to
the course, only one Tech man of

the 15 that started ran the complete
route. That man was Miller, their
star, who ﬁnished ﬁrst of all the
Tech men at Cornell and Johnstown,
but there were six Pitt men that
ﬁnished ahead of him so that there
is no doubt as to Pitt’s superiority.

The hero of the race was
Wiegel,
mile short.-cut taken‘ by the Tech
runners, won the race. H-is time,
notwithstanding the mud, was
30:02 4-5. This time is four and one-
half minutes faster than he himself
ever covered the course and, over
two and one-half minutes faster than
the course has ever «been run before.
_It was a great piece of running.
Scarcely less spectacular was that
of Ralph Klingensmith, whose time
was just 40 seconds slower than
Wiegel’-s, and of Jim Bovard, who
ran in spite of a sore foot. The
other three who ﬁnished ahead of
Miller were Smyers. Potter and
Brush, in the order named.
work was the best he has done this
year, and, in fact, the running of
the whole team was far above par.

 

Under Coach Steffens the Tech
team had developed a varied system of
attack. Their interference was good,
and they uncorked some brilliant for-
ward passes. All-in-all, the game was
as exciting as any witnessed at Forbes
Field this year. "

tween these two schools, the one
Ithe large: institution of the ‘Central
part of the State, the other the
great institution of the Western part,
than between any other schools.
The reason of this is apparent. Pitt
and‘ State are institutions. of the
same size, approximately 4,000 stu-
dents each, whereas W. & J.’s stu-
dent body does not consist of more
;than 500. This cond-ition is, of
‘course, a big handicap to VVashing-
ton and Jefferson in that it makes
impossible the adoption of the one
year residence rule and the subse-
quent placing of W.‘ & J.’s eligibility
on a par with Pitt’s and State~’s.
Moreover, it makes it difficult for
W’. & J. to place in the_ﬁeld of
sports other than football, teams of
the class of Pitt and State, although
the little school has done admirably
in this respect.

The only other instance where
such a natural rivalry as between
Pitt and State should exist is be-
tween the great institutions of the
Eastern part of the State, the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and Penn State,
representng the «Western and Central
parts. Here is a natural triangular
rivalry, where the best of feeling
should exist all around. iAnd it -is
up to Pitt and State to work for
the furtherance of their relations
with Penn to attain this end.

This is by Way of digression, but
yet h-as an important bearing on the
athletic relations of ,Pitt and State.

This article has -been prepared
‘for both Pitt and State men‘ -in order

feeling and friendly relations of the

FRESHMEN EASILY
BEAT TEIIH PLEBES 39-1]

‘The Panther Cubs closed their sea-
son with an easy victory over the
Tech Plebes walloping them 39 to 0.
“Dutch” Hendrian, acting as captain
in the absence of Holleran, played a
spectacular game and rushed his op-
ponents ' off their feet, running

 

through for four touchdowns. He,
made end runs, center bucks andi
line rush-ing with the same success.|
His last run of 50' yards was made
on an off-tackle play through the en-
tire Tartan squad. His. forward pass-
ing and the receiving of Clawson
were execellent, the latter playing
an excellent game both on offense
and defense throughout.

Hewitt at full hit the line like
Georgie McLaren when he was in his
prime, and ripped through for two
touchdowns. In fact the entire back-
ﬁeld, even with Tom Holleran out,
played ﬁne ball and ‘the line showed
up strong. Magarall at center, Wil-
liams, Hartwell and Sacklowsky were
the stellar performers.

In the second half every substitute
on ‘Coach Kerr’swtea1nl got a chance
to play and all kept up the good
work against the out-classed Plaid.
For the losers, Licktenstein at "cen-
ter, played the best game and his
position was the only ‘hard part of
the Tech line that -our boys had to
hit.

This game was the close of a
year, marred only by the 7 to 6 de-
feat at Kiski. .The team of ’23 will

another jolt by beating the Plebes by
an overwhelming score.

 

Too much credit can not be given
Capt. Phil, Marshall of the Plaid for
his work. His long ‘run for a touch-
down was by far the outstanding fea-
ture of the game.

Pitt started the game with aiteam
composed, for the most part of second

answer to many queries on the part.-

of both students and the public in
order that they may receive the

credit for the ‘splendid appearance

and showing of the band.

The part the band plays in ath-
let-ics is no small one. Nothing will’
spur on a team like good rooting and
ndthing puts “pep” into the student
body and the team like a band. The
psychology is apparent. Just as:
one’s heat throbs with patriotism as
the “Star-Spangled Banner” is play-
ed, so the Panther’s heart is stirred
with loyalty and enthusiasm as the
band strikes up “Hail to Pitt.” To
play football without a band is ltd-
ride without spurs. It is there to»
give the punch when we need it
most.

There is one other aspect of the
usefulness of the band,,which does
not directly concern its part in the
success of our athletics, yet should
be mentioned because of -its connec-
tion with the football team, and that
is the advertisement that the ham!
furnishes the University. When the
Pitt Band marched through the
streets of Philadelphia and across
Franklin Field, it created fully as
favorable an impression as did the
football team, and that is saying
something. The band advertised to-
the people of Philadelphia, if they
did not know it before, that here
at Pitt we have something besides:
a football team and that -is Pitt
Spirit, a. spirit rthat will get out and‘
raise the money to take the band to
Philadelp:hio,aspirit that is undying,

This then is the no insigniﬁcant;
part the band plays in the support;
of our athletic teams. We are there»
fore justly proud of our band and
we know that in expressing our ap-
preciation of its service we are voic—-
ing the sentiment of 8,000 Pitt stu-
dents and alumni.
