“I have known_ Pitt for 155

Starrett, assistant professor of
English and editor of Pitt Maga-
zine. _' O

“The University’ of Pittsburgh

Dr. Stanley Gray, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology, will feel quite
at ease in the Pitt Town meeting in
1324. Cathedral today since the dis-
cussion will be an Oregon style de-—
bate of “Psychological Reactions to
the War.”

He is expected to be the “expert”
because while a student at the Uni-
versity of Oregon, Dr. Gray origi-
nated the now termed “Oregon
style” of debate. J

Oregon style debates, rapidly
growing in favor all over the coun-
try, feature the cross-questioning
of each debater by a member of
the other team. Thus, in the Ore-
gon style. debate, a speech must be
strong enough to hold up against
the cross-examination ‘of an op-
ponent.

Sharing the program concerning
war effects on’ the behavior of men
and women will be Dr. Alfred
Dietze, assistant professor of psy-
chology and Dr. Verne Wright, as-p
sociate professor of sociology.

: William Seyler, C42, chairman
of the general Pitt’ town meeting
committee, said:

“Public reactions to war are im-
portant enough. to deserve atten-
tion from specialists in psychology
"and sociology. Although we‘ can-
understand a great deal of those
reactions by‘ introspection," expert
opinions on the subject are of
great value.”

, -But one of our more able re-
porters, painted with ALUMINUM

seen an assistant smuggling the
SUGAR out every evening at 5:27
under his ﬁnger-nails. His name,
and I hesitate to mention it, is
Akron Valdsfnertz, GHQ ’03.

those believing in fairies, saying,

heard to be saying, “Shoot a cube

that she came to Pittsburgh where
she has lived ever since.

The wife of a former Panther
editor, she is herself a graduate of
the class of 1920. Concerning her
graduation Mrs. Starrett declared,
“I suppose I am a pioneer since I
was graduated in the ﬁrst summer
commencement.” She received her
master’s degree in 1925.

History has always been fasci-

The National Resources Plan-‘

ar  Employment T

ployment, boldly conceived and vig-
orously pursued, is imperative.

Democracies, if they are going

to lead the world out of chaos and"

insecurity, must first and foremost
offer their people opportunity, em-

ployment, and a rising standard of

living. T

The fact is that many people
dread to think of what is coming.
Businessmen, wage-earners, white-
collar employees, professional peo-
ple, farmers-—-all alike expect and
fear a post-wa'r collapse. Demobi-
lization of armies, shut downs in
defense industries, unemployment,
deﬂation, bankruptcy, hard times.

Post-war Boom

Some are hoping for a post-war
boom. We got that after the first
World :War. Not improbably we
may get it again.

If the war lasts several years,

we may have ‘at the end of the war

sufﬁcient accumulated shortages in l

residential» housing, in durable con-
sumer's‘ goods ‘such as automo-
biles, and in the plant and equip-
ment required to supply peacetime
consumption‘ demands, to giveﬁkus
a, vigorous

private, investment

boom.

Indeed, we need to be on the ,.

alert to prevent a possible post-war
inﬂation. If in fact we do experience
a strong "post-war boom,-there is,-
however, thegravest danger that
it will lull us to sleep. Soonergor
later such a boom will end in a de-

pression, unless we are ‘prepared.

If appropriate action is taken,

there is no necessity for a post-war

collapse. ‘

Everywhere one "hears it said"

that, when this war is over, all.
countries, including our own, will
be impoverished. This view is, how-
ever, not sustained by past experi-
ence. i

ordinarily scheduled for the fall
semester will be given only during

regularly offered during the second

A Quote . 

  

x 

 

“The main task of the univer-
sity is candid and courageous
thinking about important issues.
An institution may do many oth-
er useful and valuable things. It
may train men and women in their

2 vocations. It may house and feed

the young until they can go to
work. It may play football and
play it very well.

“But it will not be a university
iunless it engages, as its principal
obligati_on, in candid and courage-
, ous thinking about important is-
sues. The better the thinking, the
more candid and courageous it is,
the greater the university.”-—-Rol»
ert Maynard Hutchins, president of
the University of Chicago.

“ln the college of tomorrow,

there will be a minimum of ‘lectur-

‘ -ing and’ quizzing of students, a

maximum of discussion and quizz-
ing of teachers. It is as easy to get
through the“, eye of.a needle as to
acquire an education by merely lis-
tening to 1ectures.”——William P.

with college training.

“Government and Indu§try alike
need skilled technicians today. Lat-
er we shall need men and women of
broad understanding and special
aptitudes to serve as leaders of
‘the generation which must manage
the post-war world.

“We must, therefore, redouble
_our efforts during these critical
times to make our schools rend_er
ever more efficient, service in sup-
port of our cherished democratic
institutions.’3——President Roosevelt.

As Small Group Reports For Drill

Having concluded a week long period of prayer for good
weather, Pitt’s varsity footballers will attempt to open spring
drills this afternoon on the practice ﬁeld clay. If the weather"
is right, the coaching staff, headed by boss Charlie Bowser,
and the squad of this year’s gridiron hopefuls will be out in
full force to oﬁicially open the current season.

Last year’s opening practices were severely hampered by
" inclement weather. At this writing it looked like this season’s
starting drills would also suffer due to the elements.

However, should the weather be
satisfactory, one of the smallest
squads in recent years will be on
hand for the initial session. The
war has already taken four men
from last season’s freshman squad
and it is not unlikely that before

, the opening whistle blows next fall

7" many more players will be missing.

The four players already in the
service are Glen McCurdy, Harry
Kozic, Charles Surina, and Dick
S,titt._l\_/l<;Curday enlisted in the
Navy, Kozic and Surina are in the
Air ‘Corps, while Stitt joined the
Marines. One of last year's letter-
men, Martin Rosepink, an end, is
holding down a defense job while
he attends classes, and will prob-
ably have to give up football.

New assistant backﬁeld coach,

Forrest” Evashevski, will have the-

smallest crew on which to work.
Only quarterback Walt West, half-
backs Bill Dutton and Jack S-tet-
ler, and fF_.ullbacks Frank Saksa and
Mat G’-eb',el‘ are returning from last

year’s.},

 
 

l-_-fated outﬁt.

 outlook up on the line isn’t

Durishan, Joe Salvucci, and Bob
Costello and guards Vince Anto -
elli,-‘ Dillon, and Bob Broudly

will greet line coaches Hartwig
and Hoel today.

There is also a possibility that
center George Allshouse, who is
now in his ﬁfth yea'r at the Uni-
versity, may be‘ eligible to play
this season. Allshouse was injured
in his sophomore year and didn’t
play at all, although he was listed
on the team roster. However, he
has had only two years of varsity
competition and may be allowed
to compete another season.

Another possible bright spot in
what promises to be another dark
year is the summer term to be
held at Pitt this year. Four prom-
ising freshmen, Clark Deywalt,

Fred Josephs, Jack Mclnary, and

Bill Kyle may become varsity tim-
-ber if they carry sufﬁcientcredits

during the third semester.

The outlook for the coming sea-
son is all up in the air. Key men
may be drafted before the opening
game with Minnesota arrives or
they may not. Some players may
decide to take full time defense
jobs in preference to returning to
school. '

Thus, as another spring practice
session opens, Coach Charlie Bow-
ser faces another headache. Pass
the aspirin please.

:,Grfaclymen Place Second
‘in E CSA Championships

Pitt’s once—beaten swimming squad met their match last

.. Saturday afternoon at the Eastern Collegiate Swimming as-

sociation championships when the strong Rutgers crew de-

fended their title by sweeping every ﬁrst place but the 50-yard
and the 100-yard sprints to ring up a total of 60 points.

Coach Grady’s undermanned aggregation took the run-

ners—up spot for the second straight year by tallying 28 points,

Phi Delts Beat
,‘PiKA To Retain
Unbeaten Mark

Phi Delta Theta trounced the
PiKA’s last Thursday afternoon,
26-13, and retained undisputed pos-
session of ﬁrst place in the Inter-
Fraternity swimming race.

The Dithridge St. boys had little

Q. trouble in downing the PiKA ag-

gregation when they took first
place in every event except the
40-yard free style.
This victory. kept the Phi Delt
slate clean, 4 victories and no de-
‘ Lfeats,,and placed them a. full game
ahea._(l_{‘f~o":f their nearest opponent,
_ the P3i'KA’s. Thus with only a few
meets-:r.e1na,ining on the schedule,
the Phi Delts are practically certain
of capturing their ﬁrst all—frater-
nity swimming title.

The Phi Delta Theta 80-yard
relay team was in peak form and
once again shattered the pool rec-
ord of :36.9, which they establish-
ed last week, y swimming the
event in :36.8. This makes the
third straight time that the Phi
Delt mermen have cracked an old
mark.

Meanwhile, Phi Gamma Delta
crushed the title hopes of the Phi

while Lafayette placed close be-
hind with 20 points.

Three Eastern records fell under
the efforts of the Rutgers tank-
men and a Rutgers’ team mark
was tied. One record smashed was
the 150-yard backstroke mark set
by A1 Beacon of Pitt in 1938.

Pittsburgh's scores came chiefly
from seconds in the medley and
free style relays, in the breast-
stroke by captain Herb Cosgrove,

and in the 100-yard free style
event by Gus Wilde.
Pitt’s 300-yard medley relay

team of Samson, Orloff and Cos-
grove took second place behind the
record breaking trio from Rutgers.
The champions from New Jersey
won this event in 3:02.9, setting a
new Eastern Collegiate Swimming‘
association mark. Lafayette, Brook-
lyn, and Franklin and Marshall ﬁn-
ished third, fourth, and fifth, re-
spectively.

The Panthers, no doubt, expect-
ed some points in the 50-yard free
style race but the best Orloff could
do was to place ﬁfth. Wilde, ap-
parently, was not on his best form
for he beat the first place man,
Gager, earlier in the season.

Marty Kramer surprised the
crowd by chasing the Rutgers lad
until the end of the 220-yard free
style race, but just couldn't over-
take him and ﬁnished an honor-
able fourth. The race was won in

Poor Weather S
Handicaps Pitt
Baseball Drills

It is true that all athletic coach-
es have troubles and worries, but
it seems that Pitt’s ‘baseball men-
tor has more than his share.

First the draft took practically
every able bodied man on the var-
sity, then the first string catcher,
Art Bariska, broke his leg,‘ and
now the weather isrthreatening to
do damage to his outdoor practice
plans. ‘ M

This will be the fourth week of
practice, with each session becom-
ing harder and harder as the boys
begin to mund into condition.

The only regular from last year’s
squad to work out has been the
ﬁrs-t baseman, Johnny Brown. An
incomplete list of. the inﬁelders
working out under the guidance of
Ralph Mitterling shows Kosterba-t-
en, Fisher, McCullough, Jacobs, and
Williams.

Art Bariska who broke his leg in
sliding practice last Monday is re-

ported ‘feeling ﬁne despite the cast’

on his leg, and expects to be re-
leased from the hospital within a
few days. It is unknown at this
time whether Bariska will be able
to perform for the Panther nine
this year or not.

Carter Wins Butler Sprint,-B
Stickel Runs Close Second

“Bullet Bill” Carter had himself
another ﬁeld day last Saturday ev-
ening at the Butler relay meet
when he nosed out teammate “Hap”
Stickel in the 60-yard dash to chalk
up his second national triumph in
the space of eight days.

Both Carter and Stickel were
nothing short of sensational dur-
ing the afternoon’s trial races when
they both won their meets in ex-
ceptionally fast time, and in the
ﬁnals outsped the fastest sprinters
in the mid-west to ﬁnish one- two
in the 60-yard dash. '

Carter’s time was recorded at 6.2
seconds, tieing the Butler relay
mark. “Hap” Stickel came through
remarkably well for, after being out
of competition for three weeks due
to his injured leg, he grabbed the
second position in the 60 and a third
in the 60-yard low hurdle race.

Bob Wright, Ohio State’s ace
hurdler, covered the ~60 yards in
the time of 7 seconds, outdistancing
both Olsen from Illinois, who, inci-
dently, placed second, and Stickel
from Pitt.

The Allies Can Loseiwar,

By‘ STUDENT OPINION SURVEYS
OF AMERICA

AUSTIN, Texas.--A plurality of
college students believes that there
is a possibility of the United-States
losing the war to the Axis, a poll
taken last week by Student Opinion
Surveys of America shows.

An almost equal number of stu-
dents believes that the Axis will
“probably” be defeated, and near-
ly as many think the Allies deﬁ-
nitely will win.

In the poll a nation-wide cross
section of college students was ask-
ed: “Which one of these statements
comes closest to expressing your
attitude about the present war?”

Zoie Odom Newsome of Texas is
a coed, commuter and housewife.
She married a lawyer who has two
degrees, so she decided, “I ought
to have at least one degree.”

To get it, a bachelor of arts
degree with a major in English, she
is commuting’ 174 miles by train
and automobile daily to study at
Texas Technological college.

Mrs. Newsome ﬁgures that when
she gets the _degree she will have
traveled 50,130 miles.

The nearly four hours .a day -

spent on the train solves herstudy

problem.

The National Education’ associa- _

tion is recommending a plan to an-
ticipate Selective Service by two

The idea is to catch promising
boys as they leave high school,
steer them into ﬁelds where they
will be of most use to the war ef-
fort. _

A “reserved category” of most
promising boys, 17 through 19.
would be allocated in schools and
colleges for training. This group
would be picked “absolutely irre-
spective” of “ﬁnancial status of the
parents, with Uncle Sam ﬁnancing
