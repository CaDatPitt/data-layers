OF THE WAR

Union issue debated at special meeting

By Jenifer Crook
Staﬂ" Writer

Several proponents and opponents of

University of Pittsburgh faculty unionization

expressed their views at a special meeting of
the University Senate yesterday.
Mark Hornak, adjunct professor of law at

Pitt, said if collective bargaining passes, “the 9
union shall be the exclusive representative‘

for all employees in the bargaining unit for
purposes of bargaining with the employer.”
With that understanding, Pitt’s faculty must

~ now decide if it wants a union to be its

exclusive representative in dealing with the
administration.
James Cunningham, a professor in the

, School of Social Work, said he supported the

formation of a union. He said that in his 30-
year career at Pitt he has experienced “the
hardships of being part—time faculty,” the
non~tenure stream and tenured professorship.

“I’ve found that no matter what knowledge
a professor has, he has no authority on issues

that affect him,” Cunningham said. “Faculty
are limited to advising and consultation, and
that we can only do when we’re allowed to
have all of the relevant information.”

Cunningham added that the current faculty
organization, the Senate Council, is not the
solution to faculty concerns about issues
such as salaries, beneﬁts, working conditions
and affirmative action.

“The senatewdoes some.useful things,” he
said, “but it provides no decision—making
role, just advisory. If collective bargaining
comes here, we’ll have the resources to beta
part of that [decision-making] I effort. ”

Cunningham said the “20—percent decline
in real faculty income during the inflationary
years” and the current salary-compression
problems as incentives to unionize.

“The university has become less competitive
in a time when it needs to be more
competitive,” he said,‘ adding that Pitt’s average
salary has fallen to 50th of_57 among schools
in the American Association of Universities.

In closing, Cunningham said, “It is not up

to the new president to lift up Pitt; collective
bargaining can provide us with the dignity to
play a partnership role.”

During the meeting, speeches alternated
between the sixproponents andopponents
of unionization, each of whom was given 10
minutes to speak. Union opponent Allen
Janis, professor of physics and astronomy,
followed Cunningham.

“The union proponents and I share many
problems with the way university matters are
handled,” he said, “butl think we should try
harder to make the present system work.”

Janis said that an improved University
Senate is a viable alternative to collective
bargaining. “If more faculty took the senate
seriously, it would be more effective,” he
said. _

Janis described the experience of a friend
who works at a unionized university. The
friend, an initial supporter of the union,
found out that the novelty of collective
bargaining eventually wears off.

The black family is not dead,
said the Rev. Jason Barr at a
lecture entitled “Resurrection of
the Black Family” last night.

The lecture, sponsored by

‘Sigma Beta Epsilon sorority,

focused on the breakdown of the
black family in America and was
held as part of Black History
Month.

“The word ‘resurrection’
[indicates] to me that something
has died,” said Barr. He said he
does not believe the black family
is dead; rather, it has been
incorrectly deﬁned.

Barr said he dismissed the
notion that the black family has

  Reverend emphasizes

traditionally been . extended.
Historically the black family has
been nuclear, with a household
consisting of both parents and
their children.

According to Barr, the nuclear
family was the norm for the black
community until 1960. Barr said
the traditional black family is “a
nuclear, extended, augmented
family  the black family is not
the traditional white family.”

Barr was raised in a nuclear
family which he described as
“Ozzie and Harriet’s house.” He
said the nuclear family is the
norm for the black community to
maintain, but he said he
recognizes other types of
supportive family groups.

SGB supports access

to police records;

plans to meet Yeager

By Tammy Stradley
Staff Writer

Access to campus police reports
should not be denied to Pitt
students, the Student Government
Board announced at its meeting
last night.

“In the spirit of openness and
honesty, we as students feel that
it is necessary that we have access
to information that directly affects
our life and well-being at the
University of Pittsburgh,” SGB
President Brent Saunders read
from the statement unanimously
agreed upon by the board.

Saunders will meet with John
vice president of
administration, today to discuss

this issue.

In other businessthe SGB, along
with Vice President of Student
Affairs William Harmon, Ph.D.,
and Director of Stu dent Activities
Joseph Cavalla, chose the William
Pitt Union as the late—night study
area.

The ground floor of the union,

including the Schenley Cafe tables _

and the open concourse area,
will tentatively be open until 2:30
a.m. or 3 a.m. from Sunday
through Wednesday, beginning
March 11. A

The SGB is also looking into
the possibility of using recycled
paper in the University Copy
Centers at the request of an
environmental group.

nuclear black family

nuclear family began in 1960,
according to Barr. In 1960, 77
percent of the families in the
black community were nuclear;
in 1980, 40 percent of the families
were nuclear.

Barr said this problem exists
almost exclusively in the black
“underclasses.” Less than 40
percent of lower—class black
families are nuclear, while 83
percent of black middle—class
families are nuclear, according to
Barr.

Barr attributed the breakdown
of the nuclear family to three
factors, among them the socio-
economic state of lower-class
blacks. He also mentioned the
overall devaluation of marriage
in America and the breakdown of

the young black male. He said
too many young men are in prison
or on the streets and not with
their families.

The solution, according to Barr,
depends heavily on the individual.
He said a strong work ethic and
an understanding of delayed
gratification are necessary to
improve one’s socio-economic
status.

In addition, one needs to have
a strong sense of self and
blackness. Barr said the black
middle class needs to realize its
responsibility to work within the
black community to help improve
it. He said that the black middle
class and the church need to
work together to help solve the
problem.

Hospital
renal unit
hit by TB
outbreak

By “Mike Hudson »\
and Jim Tezak
T be Pitt News

A tuberculosis outbreak
among six patients in the
renal unit at Presbyterian
University Hospital is under
investigation by hospital
and health-department
officials.

Three kidney transplant
patients have contracted
tuberculosis, and three
others are suspected of
having the disease, ac-
cording to Guillermo Cole,

information officer for the ~

Allegheny County Health
Department.

“The Allegheny County
Health Department and
Presbyterian University

Hospital are reviewing a,
_ limited

number of
suspected and confirmed
cases in the renal [kidney]
transplant unit,” he said. '

“We have been awareof
the problem, and we have
been working on it with the
hospital. It is a dynamic
situation that changes over
time.” .

According to Jeanne
Medvik, manager of
infection control at Presby,‘
the first case of tuberculosis
was diagnosed on Oct. 15,
1990. Other cases were
diagnosed on Dec. 5 and
Dec. 26.

Cole said that the health
department was first
notified on Oct. 22.

“Any hospital has patients
coming in with tuberculosis.
The cases here came in for
other reasons and were later
diagnosed with tuber-
culosis,” Medvik said.

Although the disease has
not reached epidemic
proportions, Cole said the
nature of the six cases
creates a significant
problem which warrants
further investigation. ’

Tuberculosis is an
infectious disease caused
by prolonged exposure to
the airborne organism
tubercle bacilli, according
to Cole. He said that there is
an average of 90 new cases
reported annually in
Allegheny County.

Q&A.' How unionization might affect students

By Donna Terrell

and Tammy Stradley
Staﬁ‘ Writers

The Pitt News asked the
university administration and the
United Faculty how a faculty
union would affect Pitt students.
Wesley M. Rohrer, coordinator of
the Academic Collective Bargain
Resource Center, responded on
behalf of the administration.

The center serves as a reference
source for anyone in the academic
community with questions on
unionization and collective
bargaining. .

The library at the center has
books and monographs on
collective bargaining, as well as
clippings about Pitt's history of
union voting and the recent
faculty union at Temple

I University. It also has materials

from The United Faculty and
Teachers for an Independent
Faculty.

The center is a service offered
by the provost’s ofﬁce on request
from Pitt President Wesley

_ ‘I99‘E '~(“l2;rz-1:-;rv3.a-Irzberrt Co. 9. ’_: .

Posvar’s office. A similar service
was offered in 1976, the last time
Pitt full-time faculty voted on a
union. Philip Wion, president of
United Faculty, responded for
the UF.

Question: How would
faculty unionization neg-
atively affect Pitt students?

Rohrer: It’s very difficult to
say. We’ve had no signiﬁcant
experience with that here at the
university. The worst scenario is
the situation at Temple and other
universities that have had
prolonged strikes, Temple being
the most immediate and recent
experience. At Temple we’ve seen
great polarization between
faculty, administration and the
students. I assume that the
students [at Temple] feel that
they’re caught in the middle
between "groups that have
different views about what should

A be in the contract.

Certainly one can't predict that
la strike] would happen here if
there is a faculty union, but that’s

a possibility. The worst case
would be a prolonged,
contentious strike. [In that casel

“the students are inevitably

involved. The effect would appear
to be mostly negative in that kind
of situation.

If there is a hostile relationship
between the faculty and
administration, that could poison
the academic environment to the
extent that the students might
feel it, might perceive it, and they
might find that it’s the kind of
environment they do not want to
be in.

Wion: I don’t think there are
necessarily going to be any
negative effects. A concern I think
I'd like to address that I’ve heard
and that the [Student Government
Board] has expressed is the idea
that if the faculty choose a union
at Pitt, [Pitt’s] potential for
excellence will be diminished
[and] our reputation in the
academic world will be harmed.
I understand that many of the
opponents of collective
bargaining feel that, or at least

they’re saying that, but in fact, I
think there’s little to it. In any
case, the quality of an institution
depends on the quality of the
work that is being done.
Reputation should follow from
the quality, not be detached from
it — when faculty have their
academic freedom protected (as
many now don’t), when they are
treated with dignity and as
professionals (and many are not
now). Part-time faculty, who teach
many classes, have inadequate
salaries and often have no offices,
no places to meet with students.
[Part-time faculty] are not made
to feel part of the university. I
think with collective bargaining
and the solidarity among faculty
that I hope that will foster, there
will be better conditions for the
teaching of part-timers in
particular, but really for all of us.

Q: Do you see students
benefiting in any way if a
faculty union is formed?

Rohrer: If you have a faculty

Q&A

Continued from page 2
that is demoralized to the point
that they aren’t functioning
effectively as teachers and
advisers and researchers, and the
union could affect that feeling
and change their perception of
their work environment and their
well—being — if the union could
do that, then there would be
some benefit to the students. That
is the only benefit I can imagine.

I would say that faculty in
schools the quality of Pitt will
continue to act as professionals
in all their teaching and research
and community service. They’re
not going to let their other
concerns with the administration
affect their performance.

Wion: I think that students
stand to gain if the faculty has
collective bargaining, for various
reasons. First of all, if the faculty
has the kind of role in decision-
making at Pitt that collective
bargaining will bring, the faculty
will have a chance to change the
priorities of this institution. I think
there’s wide agreement among
the faculty that the academic
mission of the institution has been
slighted in recent years? There
needs to be a return to a focus on
the core of the institution and its
central missions, which are
teaching and research and service.
In particular the teaching mission,
I think most faculty would agree,
has not been supported as well
as it should be. A major concern
of United Faculty is that the reward

COfIl€ lI'll€.

  

structure for faculty value,
recognize and support especially
those parts of the university where
the teaching mission is more
heavily emphasized. This is true
at the regional campuses, for
instance, but it’s also true in
various parts of the Pittsburgh
campus, and there are many
individual faculty who would like
to devote more time to students
in class and outside of class. But
because of the priorities that the
administration has insisted upon,
such faculty often are not
rewarded, and the net effect is to
turn energies away from working
with students that faculty would
like to devote to that. I think that
students stand to gain because
the academic mission will be more
adequately supported and more
central. In those respects, I think
collective bargaining for faculty
will be good for students.

Q: Will faculty unionization
affectstudents ﬁnancially?

Rohrer: It is so speculative

that I ‘d rather not even take a ~

position on that. I would think
that if a contract was passed that
increased the operational cost of

The Macintosh LC is rich in color. Unlike many computers that can display
only 16 colors at once, the Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors.

It also comes with a microphone and new sound-input technology that lets
you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds.

Like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to
master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the
same, consistent way—so once you’ve learned one program, you’re well
on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share infor-
mation with someone who uses a different type of computer——thanks to
the versatile Apple” SuperDrivej" which can read from and write to Macintosh,

If you thought that ﬁnding a color
Macintosh“ system you could afford
was just a dream, then the new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream

the university at certain levels,
then it could trigger a tuition
increase. On the other hand,
tuition increases are not rare
[events].

Again using the Temple
example, and this is the only
example we have in terms of
worst cases, there we had
situations where students had
their academic work interrupted
which may have had short-term
financial consequences and could
have longer consequences in term
of career interruption.

In a normal day—to-day situation
where faculty is unionized, you
wouldn’t expect that kind of
negative consequence. Tuition is

going to be, to a certain extent, a
function of the operating costs of
the university, and there are other
reasons that [tuition] increases.

Unionization aside, as the
university attempts to raise the
mean salary of its faculty, which
it tries to do, and it made some
commitment to do that — that
could trigger tuition increases.
[Tuition increases] can happen
independently.

Wion: I know there is concern
about this because over the years
the administration has directly
linked the size of tuition to the
size of the state appropriation,
and the state seems to be falling

upon hard times. One thing that
an organized faculty can dois,
working with our colleagues at
other institutions, help persuade
the legislature to increase state
funding. But even acknowledging
that there will always be limited
[funds] at the university, how
those funds are allocated is an
important question. [United
Faculty] believe that more of the
university’s funds should be
allocated to support the basic
academic mission.

If that’s the case, conditions
and salaries can be improved and
made more fair for faculty without
an immediate and direct impact
upon tuition.

Speaker says Germany can unify Europe

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Staﬂ“ Writer

One of the greatest social and
psychological difficulties that
Europeans face is disunity,
according to William R. Smyser,
senior associate of the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace.

“The gap is as great as it was in
the time of the Roman Empire,”
Smyser said at _a speech Tuesday
afternoon in Forbes Quadrangle.

According to Smyser, recently
reunified Germany is the key to
uniting all of Europe.

“There is an enormous gap

across the continent, and it is no
[more] visible than in Germany.
The houses are in decay. The
bathrooms are in decay; but [there
are] long, lovely country roads
with beautiful trees beside them.
There is a feeling of despair and
a sense of great material loss,”
Smyser said.

Smyser related a story of two
cousins, one born in East
Germany and the other in West.
“Right now the one in West
Germany has a large home, three
cars, two children and is traveling
to Indonesia or Italy for vacation.

“The cousin in the East has a
small flat, never had an honest

vote, and his bank account, small
as it was, has just been cut in
half,’’. Smyser said.

Germany advocates a global
currency, money that could be
used in any European country,
because it is stable. People believe
in Germany because of this,
according to Smyser. “Germany
is the center of everything in
Europe; she has nine neighbors,”
Smyser said.

Germans want to unify Europe
before expanding their inﬂuences
to the rest of the world, according
to Smyser. He added that Germans
are willing to do whatever is

Union

Continued from page 1

“After a number of years, [the
friend] found that the faculty was
no more willing to take a role in
university affairs than they had
been before the union was
formed.” As a result, he said, the
leaders of the union became more
powerful but were out of touch
with the majority of faculty.

Throughout the meeting, many
references were made to last fall’s
strike at Temple University, where
the faculty is unionized.

“The union proponents say a
strike is unlikely but certainly
don’t rule it out,” said Janis. “I
certainly oppose holding students
hostage to attain our own goals.”

Janis said now is not the
optimum time for faculty to vote
ori the collective-bargaining issue.

“Unless you are convinced that
a union is desirable under all
circumstances, then now is not
the best time. Why not let the
new president have a chance
first?” ’

' Philip Wion, president of United
Faculty, the group that will

represent the faculty if it votes for
unionization, said that the vote’s
timing has nothing to do with the
upcoming change in presidents.

“If the United Faculty had its
way, we would have been
addressing these questions a long
time ago,” he said, alluding to the
administration’s efforts to stop
union formation.

The administration and the
United Faculty have been in court
for over eight years over whether
Pitt faqulty should be allowed to
unionize.

The main point at issue was
whether Pitt professors should
be considered mangers or
employees of the university.
Managers cannot be part of a
collective-bargaining unit;
employees can.

Initially the hearing examiner
ruled that Pitt faculty members
were managers, basing his
decision on a 1980 U.S. Supreme
Court case involving Yeshiva
University. In November, the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board reversed that decision, and

UF was granted the right to hold
a collective-bargaining vote.

Wion also said that Temple’s
situation should not be a
consideration in faculty members’
decisions. “lUnion opponents] are
giving the worst—case scenario,”
hesaid. “Temple is a different
university with a different set of
circumstances.”

With a union, he added, it
would be “good to have a legal
process to turn to to settle
disputes. It will mean true
collegiality, working together for
the benefit of not only the faculty
but of the students.”

However, not all Pitt students
agree. Several members of the
Student Government Board,
including SGB President Brent
Saunders, expressed their
concerns about unionization.

“The possibility does exist that
it can turn out like Temple,” said
Saunders. “People forget about
theeffect a union could have on
students.”

the University of Pittsburgh at
johnstown, people also forget
the negative impact collective
bargaining could have on Pitt’s
branch campuses.

“The union would be
dominated by Pittsburgh faculty,”
he said. While union proponents
said a union couid raise branch
salaries to those at Pittsburgh,
“the whole point is that we are
not similar; we are different,”
said Walstad. “The implications
of a union could be that we get
lumped generically with other
regional campuses or that we get
pushed into the research mold of
the Pittsburgh campus. Our
concentration is on

I undergraduate education.”

But another branch-campus
faculty member, Judith Zimmer-
man, disagreed. A history
professor at Pitt-Greensburg,
Zimmerman said that a union is
needed to protect non—tenure-
stream professors.

“The current system of tenure

procedure can only be protected
by a contract,” she said.‘ “A
candidate should be protected
from shifting tenure requirements
and procedures. We will be doing
the new president a favor if we
provide him with a set of
procedures so that he or she can
nile fairly.”

The meeting concluded with
questions and comments
addressed to the panel by
members of the audience. Pitt
faculty members will be receiving
their collective-bargaining ballots
by mail this week from the PLRB.
The ballots must be returned by

Defending ourposztzon. ..

It is now Day 8 of the ban on campus police records, and
Vice President‘ of Administrationjohn Yeager has attempted
to defend his actions by hiding in gray areas of various
laws concerning the issue. Because of this, the university
population has come up with some questions.

-In his letter, Yeager claimed that the university, being

i a state—related school, does not qualify as a state agency.

Under the 1965 Pennsylvania Right to Know Act, the
public must have access to public records needed to
decide vital public issues. _ D g

This law applies to all state agencies. Under this law
“any state or municipal authority or other similar
organization created by statute and that performs an
essential governmental function” is accounted for.

The campus police officers are permitted to and are
trained toftlnction as regular police officers, which means
that they can carry weapons and throw people in jail. In
other words, they uphold the law. .

This is a clear job for a governmental agency; therefore,
the campus police fall into that category. This means they
must provide the public with information. _,

-Yeager said the Freedom of Information Act is a
federal law which does not pertain to the university. The
first part of that statement is true. However, it is also true
that the universitydoes receive some measure of federal
aid: $113 million in the 1990 budget, to be exact.

Because of this aid, the university falls under the
jurisdiction of federal law and thereby forces authorities
to disclose the required information.

c Finally, Yeager claimed that campus police records are
education records, thereby prohibiting their release under
the Buckley Amendment, passed in 1974. Under this
amendment, student education records are not to be
released for print. A

Cases disputing this amendment are still pending in
court because the courts are determining whether or not

the release of campus police records violates student

privacy. We believe that they do not, and therefore we
believe that the Buckley Amendment does not apply in
this case.

The campus has also questioned why The Pitt News is
waging this battle against the university. Many people
believe that we should just get rid of the campus police
blotter. But this fight is not just for the blotter. The
university is withholding valuable information from not
only The Pitt News but from the public as well —
information which could be vital to the safety of this
campus. The public also has the right to see this information,
as we pointed out earlier. .

Finally, The Pitt News has decided to print what stories
we can from the meager information given to us. By doing
that, we feel that we can at least give the campus some
sense of what is happening.

It is Feb. 14, and another “day
0’ love” is upon us. That’s right,
folks. It is Valentine’s Day. It is
the day in the middle of the short
month of February — a day that
is named for some guy called St.

. Valentine. I assume he was either
a great romantic or a great

purveyor of jelly—f]led chocolates.
This man's namesake holiday

falls among other great days,.like ’

Abraham Lincoln’s birthday and
George Washington’s birthday.
Take a look at your calendar at
home. I swear there are more
things written on the month of

February than any other month .

of the year.

The primary day of focus in
this month is not Presidents’ Day,
when the banks and government
offices are closed (and when the
University of Pittsburgh would
be closed if this wacky “Great
Americans’ Day” did not exist on
the preceding Friday). No, instead

_ it is the day set aside for people

in love and for sweethearts to
show their affections for one
another by the exchange of gifts
(and perhaps even bodily ﬂuids).

So anyway, here it is, another
Valentine’s Day, and I find myself
without a sweetheart for the 21st
year in a row. It is not a streak
that I am particularly proud of,
although my wallet has “never

really felt the true burden of a .

Another casualty of V-Day

Matta

full-ﬂedged V-Day. V

Actually, if the truth were
known, the one timethat the one
and only true love of my life and
I were together on Valentine’s
Day was two years ago, but we
were not really getting along very
well, and I had to work that night,
so we never really celebrated. In
fact, after she bought me a card
—— and I did not have a chance to
do the same —- she ended up
throwing out the card, and there
was no Valentine’s Day for either
of us that year.

Actually, we never had a real
Valentine’s Day together. That’s
right; the one and only true love
of my life and I broke up less than
a year later. But enough about
that. This is not the proper forum
for a personal account of my
trials and tribulations with love.

The point is that I will be
spending V-Day the same way
that I have spent the last few V-
Days. I will be watching my
television diligently at home and

being entertained by the comic I

love stories of America's favorite
stars of half—hour sitcoms.
I ﬁgure I will start off with “The

Simpsons,” because I have seen
the “Cosby” version of Valentine’s
Day several times already. Then
I will turn to NBC for a little “A
Different World” action (without
Lisa Bonet, that is), followed by
everybody’s favorite, the gang at
“Cheers.” Oh, yes, who could
miss good old Sammy’s efforts to
get Rebecca or some other
dazzling woman in the sack?.I

knowl will be tuned in anxiously.’ ~

After that, it is up in the air until
“LA Law,” and that’s it for my
night of romance with the
television set.

Perhaps a little wine or some
oysters will completely create the
mood that I am looking for with
my companion, the Panasonic
color television. Maybe I will
bring home some ﬂowers, some
chocolate candy and a card for
my devoted and easy-to—get-
along-with source of
entertainment. I know what I’ll
do.-I will send my television an
FTD “hearts and love bouquet,”
just like Merlin Olsen would do.

Screw that idea. I am going to
call up some girl and get a date —
assuming that she has not read
my article yet. I will tell you how
it went in my Valentine’s Day
column next year. Happy
Valentine’s Day,- everybody. *

When the Panthers play the St.

‘ Pitt Coach Paul Evans said
yesterday he may start Antoine
Jones or Chris McNeal in place of

has struggled on the court as of
late.

Shorter was scheduled to
undergo a physical examination
yesterday, possibly to see if the
viral infection that plagued him
for the first half of the season had
returned. Shorter was absent from
the start of the Panthers’ optional
practice yesterday, and Evans
said he had not received a report
from Pitt trainer Tony Salesi.

Shorter had only six points in
last Saturday’s win against Boston
College and scored a career—low

Seton Hall, when the Pirates

Villanova will no doubt be looking to repeat as

“It’s going to be a very good meet,” Coach Steve

championship. Villanova looks stronger than
anybody, talent-wise. They’re going to be tough.
[But] I think if anyone is capable of beating them,

The Pitt men’s indoor track team warmed up for
the upcoming Big East Championship meet this
weekend after several individuals came _away with
impressive times in the Husker Invitational at the
University of Nebraska last week.

In Lincoln, senior Elbert?Ellis ran an NCAA-
qualifying time of 7.23 seconds in the 55—meter
hurdles to finish in second place at the meet. Ellis
had already qualified earlier this season with a time
of 7.21.

“Ellis has been steady for us since he was a
freshman,” said men’s track coachJohn Vasvary. “I
hate to see the word ‘senior’ because he is that
good.”

Ellis has won Big East titles in the 400m run and
hurdles and has also gained All-American honors
and several Big East outdoor track records in his
career.

“He’s got it all,” Vasvary said. “He’s a great leader

For the first time, former Pitt football coach Mike Gottfried
has been linked with the investigation of the activities of
assistant coach Frank D’Alonzo.

Gottfried allegedly had his administrative assistant, Alex
Kramer, call assistant coach Steve Coury after Coury volunteered
to cooperate with an in-house university investigation of
D’Alonzo, The Pittsburgh Press reported yesterday.

Gottfried admitted that he had Kramer call Coury but denied
being present at the time of the call. The article said Gottfried
was in Kramer's office during the call.

Gottfried allegedly wrote down on a board what he wanted
Kramer to say to Coury. Gottfried reportedly told Kramer to tell
Coury he was destroying the program and that he knew Coury
had pledged his support to John Bolvin, Pitt’s faculty
representative to the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

Bolvin supposedly contacted Coury concerning the
investigation of D’Alonzo.

Pitt Director of Athletics Edward Bozik said that the call could
possibly be included in Pitt’s report to the NCAA after the
university conducts its second investigation of allegations
against D’Alonzo in two years.

After sweeping the Big East diving
championships for the third straight year
and setting several Pitt diving records last
weekend, senior John Sharkey may have
earned himself a seat among the greatest
athletes in Pitt history.

But being the most dominant diver in
the East forthe last five years hasn’t been
easy. '

Sharkey has overcome a devastating
shoulder injury and matured since his
erratic early years to take his diving to a
higher level.

“He is more mature now both physically
and mentally, ” said Pitt diving coachJulian
Krug. “His maturation process has not
been smooth. It has been bumpy, but it

i'B1tATHLETE§”-WEEK

has certainly occur—red. If he wasn’t so
mature, his diving wouldn’t be where it is
today.”

Sharkey began diving at a country club
in his home state of Maryland at the age of
five. By the time he was in seventh grade,
he was diving with his high-school team.
Even then, he was the best. And he
wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s fun to win,” he said. “I don’t want
to do something unless I can be the best.”

His lofty aspirations suffered a temporary
setback during his freshman year at Loyola
High School. He placed second in the
Maryland State Championships, and for
Sharkey that was not good enough.

“It blew my mind," he said. “I wanted to

go four years as Maryland state champion,
but I only went three years because some
senior had the meet of his life. Nobody
was going to beat me, right! And then
there he is. He was on; I missed some
dives, and he won.”

He earned a scholarship to Pitt and
made a big splash on the eastern diving
scene. He will graduate this April with a
communications degree. But excelling in
the classroom has not always been
Sharkey’s top priority.

“When he was a freshman, he wanted to
major in diving, and that was it,” said Krug.

‘“He has worked his fanny off to get his

communications degree. He is motor-
oriented. Studying does not come second
nature for John. Second nature is get up
and move. The fact that he is graduating is
a feather in his cap."

His diving was erratic as a freshman, but

he soon mastered the psychological side
of diving. Now, he doesn't have to think
about diving — the brain just takes over.

"Right before I get on the board, I'll say

I a word that puts me in a trancelike state,"

he said. “The perfect dive will appear in
my mind, and I will just put it on automatic
pilot and just do it."

Occasionally, his mental skills broke
down. In the summer before his freshman
year of Pitt, he hit his head and arms on the
diving board while doing a reverse three-
and-a-half somersault. The dive has
haunted him throughout his career.

"lThat kind of incident] can cause brain
damage,” Krug said. “Not in the physical
sense, but in the psychological sense.
Suddenly you are thinking about the board.
If you are thinking about that, you can't
dive at top level. Overcoming that fear has

the match with an 11-6 season
record) and at heavyweight,
where junior Perry Miller has
amassed a 14-6-1 record.

While Edinboro is not
nationally ranked, Stottlemyer
believes that “they are a strong,
solid team, andit could be a
three- or five-point match,
either way.”

Having just wrestled against
their arch nemesis Penn State,
it is questionable whether or
not the team will experience a
letdown against Edinboro.

However, Stottlemyer was

quick to fan the ﬁre, noting, ‘

“this match is very important
to us. I think we’ll be ready to
wrestle.”

whatever happens.”

The Panthers will have to adjust their defense of
Sealy. In the first matchup between the two teams,
Sealy burned the Panthers for a team-high 35
points and nine rebounds, and St. John’s won the
game 73-71 at Alumni Hall. Center Robert Werdann
added 19 points while beating the Pitt big men
down the court.

Shorter and Matthews each scored 16 points in
the game, but the 71 points was the lowest
offensive output of the season for the Panthers.
Evans said the same kind of game may occur on
Saturday.

“Any time you play St. John's, you're gonna have
a low-scoring game," said Evans. “We gave them
some easy shots inside. Malik and Werdann were

“We have to pick them up in transition,” said Pitt

and Syracuse all have legitimate
claims to the Big East title.

Lewis has built the team up
since its first Big East appearance
in 1985, when it placed eighth
and scored just three points. In
1989 the Lady Panthers won their
first title, and in 1990 they were
runners-up to Villanova.

But now that Pitt has established
itself as a force to be reckoned
with in the East, it has become
more and more concerned with
its national reputation.

“We’re not treating [the Big
East Championships] as an end,”
Lewis said.

“We're treating it as a very, very
important emotional leap along
the way. We’ve come to the point
where we can base our program
and our goals toward the top of
the line — the [NCAA] cham-
pionships.”

But this weekend the Lady
Panthers will take a break from
their individual quests for national
qualifying times to concentrate
on the team effort.

“The good part is that most of
the people who we wanted to
have qualifying times have
already gotten them,” Lewis said.
He's talking about Keisha Demas,
who currently holds the second-
fastest time in the nation in the
400—meter run; Allison Williams
in the 55m hurdles; and the
1,600m relay team of Demas,
Clarissa Dudley, Ronise Crumpler
and Kim Blair.

The relay team finished in 5
minutes, 41.07 seconds for a win
last Saturday at the University of
Nebraska's Husker Invitational
and is ranked third nationally.

Lewis emphasized the
importance of the team concept
at the Big East Championships
and said he looks to his four
seniors, Cathy Chrissos, Alexis
Archer, Dudley and Demas, to
lead the way.

“We have several people who
are quality athletes and have the
ability to perform,” he said. “But
generally speaking, we have four
people with four years of

experience who will take our

team in any direction it will go.
They’ve done it before; they’re
doing it now.”

Demas is a three-time Big East
champion in the 400m and has
run on two championship mile-
relay teams.

Dudley, last year’s Big East
champion in the triple jump, has
the potential to become Pitt’s all-
time leading Big East point-scorer.
In 1989, she alone contributed 24
points to Pitt’s victory.

Archer, one of the top jumpers
in the East, was the Big East
outdoor champion in the triple
jump last year and was a runner-
up in both the triple and long
jumps in the 1989 indoor
conference championships. A

Chrissos is the team’s premiere
middle-distance runner and ran
on the 1989 Big East outdoor
runner—up 5,200m relay team.

Sharkey

Continued from page 8
been a major battle for John.”

He sat out most of his sophomore year because of a
shoulder separation while trying to “rip” through the
water — cutting down on the splash during his entry. His
left shoulder remained loose in the socket and eventually
required reconstructive surgery.

“The lowest point [of my career] was when I had my
eighth dislocation,” he said. “When I was 19, I was told
thatl would have a plastic shoulder by the time I was 20.

_ My life had been focused on diving for 13 years, and now

they were telling me I couldn’t dive again.”

He still undergoes grueling rehabilitation, and although
the shoulder has healed, his psyche has remained scarred
to this day. Many times during his career Sharkey feared
that his shoulder would break down, and his visualization
skills would cripple him.

“Before I received surgery on my shoulder, I would be
on the board, visualizing the perfect dive, and when I hit

the water, my arm would be stuck in my back. When I
looked down, my arm was gone. I was thinking, “Where’s
the pain” and my arm was stuck in my back. I would just
picture that happening when I hit the water. Acute visual
‘mal—havoc.”’

Despite the traumatic experience, Sharkey has
maintained a light attitude about the injury. Now he even
jokes about it. “Hey baby, wanna see my scar?”

However, there is one scar that Sharkey doesn’t like to
talk about. He was declared ineligible to compete in last
year’s NCAA championships. At the time of the incident,
Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik commented on the reason
for the suspension.

“lHis ineligibility] could be [because of] any number of
things, and that’s really a matter of privacy guarded by the
privacy laws. Whether it’s academic ineligibility, whether
it’s a violation of amateurism, whether it’s drugs, whatever
it might be. Any of those causes [or] violations of team
standards—— any of those can render an athlete ineligible.”

“There are so many rules [that can make] an athlete
ineligible,” Sharkey said. “A coach can’t drive an athlete
to practice. He can’t drive him home. A coach can’t give
an athlete five dollars if he needs a loan. It’s too much of
a hassle.

“This year is all that matters to me. I am more focused
than I have ever been.”

Sharkey’s collegiate career will climax at the NCAA
championships in Indianapolis. Two years ago he finished
17th, missing the coveted All-American status by one
spot. He keeps the pain he felt then in the back of his
mind to serve as stronger motivation.

“Ouch, that hurt," he said. “This year, though, I am
going to win the championship. I want to win it. If I don’t

win it, I’ll at least be top5. I don’t see myself anywhere ;

else but in the top 5.

“Right now, I’m a better diver than I have ever been in
my past. I have more experience. It’s time. I’ve got a job
to do, and I'm going to do it.”

Continued from page 8

on and off the track. He does all
that a coach could ask.”
Finishing in third place behind
Ellis in the 55m hurdles was
teammate Brett Shields with a
time of 7.35, which made him a
provisional qualifier for the
NCAAs. /

“Brett’s really come on [strong]
this year, ” Vasvary said. “His times
have dropped, and he ran very
well at Nebraska. He’s really
worked hard this year and has
stepped up.”

Provisional qualifying for the
NCAA Championship is necessary

championship has a very strict

and if enough athletes do not

concerned about the health of his
squad and admits that some of
Pitt’s runners will have to turn it
up a notch.

“We still have some naggin,
injuries," Vasvary said. “We al Q
have people just coming off
injuries, and where they stand
right now is hard to say. Ideally,
you would like to have everybody

teammates have to step in and

THE PITT NEIVS BOOK OF LOVE

By Jennifer Swoboda
For T be Pitt News

A first kiss is something everyone
remembers. _

Veronica Boyce said her first kiss
happened on a dare in sixth grade. Her
friends dared her to kiss a boy who sat
behind her in class.

“I was pretty aggressive about it,”
said Boyce. “I just turned around and
grabbed the poor kid's face and kissed
him. It was really horrible. Our teeth
knocked together, and people teased
me about it for years afterwards."

Freshman Michelle Klein said her

first kiss happened at her best friend’s»

12th birthday party.

“I thought I was in love with my
friend's older brother, who was two
years older than us. He knew I hada
crush on him and asked me to go
outside on the porch after the party,
and that's where he kissed me. We
ended up going out again for a while
when we were older,” she said.

Jeff T orchia, a sophomore, said his
first significant kiss happened in the
science wing, better known as the
“make-out wing,” of his junior high
school.

   
 

' “Everybody made out there before
the bus came after school. The first time
Ilkissed someone there, a teacher came
over and yelled at everyone to leave,”
said Torchia,

When Jason Kozielic was 11 years
old, he went to summer camp in
Maryland. He kissed a girl for the first
time when they were both alone by a
lake.

“I came back to camp every summer
after that until ninth grade, but never
got to kiss her again, even though I
would have liked to,” said Kozielic.

“We were at the movies, and I was in
eighth grade” said Lisa Lechner. “I was
with this guy, Robert, and the whole
thing was really awkward. He put his
arm around me and leaned over to kiss
me and missed my mouth completely.
He tried again, though, and got it right.”

Adam McCormick took advantage of
an illness to procure his first kiss.

“When I was in seventh grade, I was
out of school for about a week and a
half with the ﬂu, and a bunch of my
friends came over to see me after
school. The last girl to leave was sitting
on the couch with me in my TV room,
and she moved over right beside me,

I and we kissed. She wasn't too smart to

Tl)ursda_); February 14, 1991

Pitt students remember their first kiss  

kiss me when I was that sick, butl don’t
think she caught anything,” he said.

Ellen Sabastian said her first kiss

happened in first grade because her
sister forced her to kiss someone. “His
name was Troy, and I don’t even re-

member why my sister wanted me toﬂ
V kiss him, but she made me kiss him.”

“It was pretty typical,” said Dan Leer.
“My parents dropped me off at my
junior—high formal with my date, and
the dance was really boring, but I
wanted to kiss this girl the whole time.
I knew I had to do it before my parents
came. So before we left, while we were
in the hallway, I asked her if I could kiss
her. I kissed her again at her house, but
that was it.”

“It was on my first date in 10th
grade,” said Scott Palmer, a senior. “I
was really nervous. We went back‘ to
her house, and afterward I kissed her
goodbye. I just took off in my car and
drove home. I was still really nervous.”

Janice Nicholas said she was playing
tag in sixth grade and was on base with
a' guy in her class when he kissed her.
“He was the nicest guy,” said Nicholas.
“But I never expected him to kiss me.
It actually turned out to be one of the
better kisses I’ve experienced.”

Students tell of romantic times

By Virginia Brown

For The Pitt News

For many students,

’Valentine’s Day is a time of

reﬂection —' a time to think
of the romantic things others
have done for them on this
special day.

When asked the question,
“What was the most roman-
tic thing anybody ever did
for you on Valentine's Day?”
members of the student body
told a variety of stories.

Colleen McCauley, a
freshman, said, “We got
dressed up really fancy. He
got me ﬂowers, and we went

HEY SUGAR
WOOFER,
NI NUM NU,

LOVE

to a candlelight dinner. Then
went to see Les Miserables.
When we got back to his
house, he made a fire in the
fireplace. And we spent the
rest of the evening sitting
there sipping" wine and
kissing.”

Mark, a senior, spoke
fondly of his romantic esca-
pade with a friend.

“She told me that we were
going out to dinner and to
dress nicely. She gave me
ﬂowers and silk boxers with
Mickey and Minnie Mouse
kissing each other. She
picked me up and did not
tell me where we were go-
ing.

“We went up to Mount

Washington and stood at the

balcony looking at the view.
We decided to ride the incline
down and walked all over
Station Square. We then rode
the subway till we got off

under the U.S. Steel Building

and went to dinner at the

Top of the Triangle.”

Sophomore Amy Kapusta

said that her best Valentine’s
Day came when her boy-
friend planned a mystery
date.

_« “It was Valentine's Day,”

said Kapusta, “and I knew‘

that my boyfriend and I were
going out, but not where. He
came and picked me up and
blindfolded me. He took me
into the car and we drove

. down to the Vista [Hotel]. He
had rented a room. It was set
up with a picnic on the floor,
and he had a dozen white
roses.”

Freshman Kim Butala re-
flected wistfully on a past
Valentine's‘ Day.

“I received a letter in the

mail for my best friend's
surprise birthday party. It was
supposed to be at her house,
butwhen I got there, her
mom told me that it had
been. switched to my
boyfri-end’s house. When I
got to my boyfriend’s house,
hefivas there with a candle-
light dinner and a dozen red
roses,” she said

Valentine’s Day is often
thought of as a day for giving
and receiving cards, ﬂowers
and chocolate.

However, 12 sixth—graders
at Frick International Studies
Academy have some mean—
ingful thoughts about
Valentine’s° Day.

Nicole said that Valentine’s
Day was a time “to tell
someone special that you
love them and care for them.”
Chean had similar thoughts.
She said, “It’s the day to
show somebody how much

they mean to you and how
much you love them.”

Vanessa and Tameka kept
their comments short and to
the point. Vanessa said, “It
means like saying that you
love someone,” and Tameka
said Valentine’s Day is about
“someone who is special in
your heart.”

“It’s a time you cherish the
love of being with someone,”
Erika said, and Faith added
that it was “a day when you
sit down with the person
you love.”

According to Nafessa, “It’s

Ooklonol stores offer vorie

By Mike Ertl
Staff Writer

“How do I love thee? Let
. me count the ways.”
— Elizabeth Browning

Well, there are a lot of
ways that you can let your
main squeeze know that you
love him or her, but most are
going to cost you, and some
of them don’t come cheaply.

When looking for that last-
rninute gift that won’t break
your bank account, campus-
area shops offer a wide range
of selections, from the tradi-
tional to the  well, not so
traditional.

For the traditionalists
there's always that old Val-
entine’s Day standard: roses.

According to Joan
Georgetson, co-owner of
Georgetson’s Flowers on
Atwood Street, red roses are
the most popular flower
given on Valentine’s Day. A
dozen red roses in a box will

’ run you $45 at Georgetson’s
shop. The average price at
area shops is slightly over
$50.

That might be a little steep
for the college student on a
tight budget, but Georgetson
said most students come in
and order less expensive
items.

“People don’t have to be
afraid that they have to come
in and only order a dozen
roses. We do a lot of one
rose in a box for $5, or one
rose wrapped. That is an
enormous part of our sales.”

There are other flowers
that are also popular On

1 Valentine’s Day that aren't as

;expensive as roses, such as

" Carnations, which sell for
$1.25 each.

“Because of being in the

middle of the college area,
we try to keep the prices
affordable,” said Georgetson.

Flowers are always nice,
but if your taste runs a little
more to the unusual, you
might want to look inside a
shop like Drawers, located
on Meyran Avenue.

“The thing about this is
that it’s a fun store, and it’s
fun things, and it’s creative
things. It's just having fun
with underwear,” said store
manager Renite Martin.

Although her shop deals
primarily in men's under-
wear, Martin said she also
carries an extensive line of
sexy items for women, and
her clientele runs about even
among men and women.

According to Martin, her
shop carries items that range
in price from less than $10
for a pair of see-through or
Velcro tear-away underwear
or a glow-in-the-dark
condom, to silk robes that
run slightly less than $80.

There is also the standard
array of crotchless panties,
pasties and lingerie for the
ladies, and silk boxer shorts
for the gents.

Besides the various kinds
of novelty underwear items,

Martin said that other popu-
lar items include romantic
board games, and edible
paints and lotions.

If your sweetheart has a
sweet tooth, but edible un-
derwear or body paints don’t
exactly whet his or her ap-
petite, you can always make
the trek to the local candy
shop. '

According to Jerry Dimpel,
owner of Goodies candy
shop on Oakland Avenue,
“The heart-shaped box is very
traditional for this time of
yean”

Although the one-pound
box of chocolates is his big-
gest seller at $12.25, Dimpel
said that less expensive items
such as the smaller two-
ounce, heart-shaped boxes
and milk- chocolate long-

y of g if’rs

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News
This pair of underwear can be purchased at Drawcr's.

stemmed roses are also
popular and can be bought
for less than three dollars.

Customers can also fill box
with whatever they want,
not just the expensive
chocolates, according to
Dimpel.

“Most of my customers are
students, and they have
limited funds,” he said.

The store also carries a

"line of sugar-free and low-

calorie candies for those who
like their sweets but are afraid
of putting ‘on the extra
pounds

Other popular items that
won’t bust your budget are
available from local card and
gift shops. Valentine bal-
loons, lapel pins and small
stuffed animals can be pur-
chased for $10 or less.

Nobody should pressure anybody to have sex. Especially if you feellyou’re not ready. Or prepared. It's a fact of life
that if you have sex without safe, effective birth control, you're going to get pregnant. Who should be responsible for
birth control? It can be you, it can be him, even better when it's both. If you need information or just someone to talk

THE PITT NEWS BOOK OF LOVE

Courtship rituals vory throughout history

By Kim Palmiero
Staff‘ Writer

Expressions of love vary
widely throughout: the world.
To some tribes in Africa, for
instance, the thought of
kissing is disgusting.

Though kissing is preva-
lent in Western culture,
kissing is not preferred in
parts of Asia, Africa and
among some Eskimo tribes.

In fact, it has been said that
kissing is not innatein hu-
mans. How then did we ar-
rive at this enjoyable pastime?
According to William J.
Fielding’s Strange Customs
of Courtship and Marriage,

“kissing evolved from the
primitive maternal kiss and
from the nursing of the infant
at the mother’s breast.” An-

other speculation is that the

kiss originated from our ab-
original ancestors’ practice
of licking thewsalt off one
another.

Kissing along the roadside,
or “parking,” began during
the horse-and—buggy days
and was known as “spoon—
ing” or “mooning.”

Various “kissing games”
also prevailed throughout
history. Catching a woman
under the mistletoe is one of
the oldest and probably most
familiar. In colonial New
England, if a young man took
a pair of woman’s gloves, he
could demandla kiss as for-
feit for the gloves’ return.
Card games have also served
as a medium through which
a gentleman could steal a
kiss from his favorite lady.

Courting among today’s
Pitt students might consist of
dinner at The Original Hot
Dog Shop and a movie. In
Lapland, courting was more
formal. A young man could
announce his courtship to a

young woman by giving her
father two bottles of brandy
and showering her with gifts.

In Scotland, young couples
went to a stream to clasp
hands and, using the moon
as their witness, seal their
engagement.

Weddings throughout his-
tory have said interesting
things about societies.

Naked weddings, under-
water weddings and up-in-
the-air weddings are just a
few deviations from the tra-
ditional American ceremony.
The ancient Medes of
northern Iran had a curious
ceremony.

The couple, in the presence
of friends and relatives, made

incisions into one another’s'

arms. After combining their
blood they would drink it,
symbolizing the two lives
becoming one.

Medieval weddings re-
flected the significance of
weaponry. Sixteenth-century
British brides carried a knife
during the marriage cer-
emony.

Some people believe that
it is possible to lure your
intended love with magic
potions. Such potions were
especially popular among the
ancient Greeks.

Some unusual ingredients
may have included calf’s
brains, hair from a wolfs tail,
the blood of doves and snake
bones, just to name a few.

Apart from love potions,
some parts of the human
body were considered to be
a sort of live love charm.

It was once believed that
the liver was the origin “of
human desire. This old be-

lief still lives in one African
tribe. ‘

The female, after carefully
surveying a line of potential
husbands, exclaims, “You
have captured my liver” to
her favorite.

. *6-Rn2.7' HORSE
50/l//(>’ae72/

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Even in my fetid mind I never would have dreamed up such a
combination: Neil Young & Crazy Horse, Sonic Youth and Social
Distortion. The crowd ought to be a show in itself, oscillating from
drug-crazed hippies to hardcore punks and everything in between.

Sonic Youth has garnered acclaim since its birth in 1981, when
Thurston Moore (guitar), Kim Gordan (bass), Lee Ranaldo (guitar)
and then-drummer Richard Edson got together in the underground
haven of New York City’s Lower East Side.

After several albums and changes in drummers, Steve Shelley
joined the ranks of Sonic Youth around the time B VOL was released
in 1986. His drumming experience with the Crucifucks and the
Spastic Rhythm Tarts, along with his versatility, made him an inherent
member of the band.

From Sonic Youth’s beginning, it’s been a steady climb through the
alternative ranks. Each successive album related yet another dimension
of the band to its eager followers.

Daydream Nation, a double LP released in 1988, busted Sonic
Youth out of itsprevious “cult status” and began to prove that
alternative music could be accessible without “selling out!”

Which is exactly what fans hollered when Sonic Youth signed to
Geffen Records in 1989. But Goo, released in 1990, was far from a
sellout. It left label—happy critics reeling in disbelief that creativity of
this level could exist on a major label. It does!

But not without a great deal of effort on the band’s part. It all comes
down to money, as most things in this world do. The rule is, the more
you have, the better off you are.

“We’re self—sufficient on the road. We’ve paid for everything
ourselves,” says Shelley from his hotel bed in Detroit. It’s 11 a.m.,
early by rock ‘n’ roll standards. “We don’t ask for record company
money. It helps us keep artistic freedom; the less money you owe the
record company, the more autonomy you have.”

Probably the most label—minded project the band took on was
putting together ‘videos for MTV. It was more of a chance to
experiment with the major media than an attempt to sell a million
records.

“No, it’s not that weird,” Shelley says of Sonic Youth’s MTV clips.
“They really don’t play us all that much, so I don’t feel like We’re
crossing over to MTV like Billy Idol or Faith No More. We’re like a
curiosity on MTV.” _

For the more adventurous, Sonic Youth has recently finished a
video for Goo. It was made on a much smaller budget with several
different directors and contains the unedited frivolity that you won’t
find on MTV.

Dazzling as this all may seem, seeing their faces on television,
traveling around the country and playing large venues with a
nationally recognized musician is a welcomed challenge for the band
members. For Sonic Youth, this tour is just another step in its ever-
progressing success story.

“Someone from Neil’s management contacted our management

City Theatre relocates Church o theSoLJil15ide

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News
During City Theatre’s

prolonged search for a new home
on the South Side, I tried to
imagine how it would pull off
productions like
Incommunicado without that
stifling, boxlike atmosphere.

I was disappointed about the
loss of that incredible theater
space on Sennott and Bouquet
streets which has housed City
Theatre during the past decade.
It seemed to me that the kind of
audience—actor interaction

V allowed by the current theater

has contributed significantly to
the successes of many City
Theatre productions and will be
difficult to duplicate.

Well, the new theater, the
former Bingham Street United
Methodist Church, has finally
been bought, and City Theater
will move in (whether I like it or
not) for the start of the 1991-92
season.

Apparently, architect Leonard
_Perfido, who is designing the

  
 

  

All insurance forms processed

stage, will try to preserve that
signature City Theatre intimacy
in the new 260—seat facility.
Seating will be arranged in the
same three-quarter configuration,
with the option to shift to
proscenium seating for certain
productions.

The property purchased by City
Theatre includes the church, the
attached parsonage and an
adjacent commercial building.

The church will house the
theater, a rehearsal room, the
box office, administrative offices
and a lobby with a concessions
stand and bar.

The parsonage will hold the
costume shop and dressing
rooms, and the commercial
building will hold a scene shop
and a 100-seat “black box" theater
where staged readings and
experimental works will be
performed.

Although ,the church’s high
ceilings will kill some of that
“box” effect, they will also allow
for better lighting and acoustics.
Another plus is that at the new
theater, set designers won’t have

Awakenings, French movie star Gerard Depardieu for Cyrano de
Bergerac (which is playing next month at the Pittsburgh Playhouse),
Richard Harris in The Field (which is showing next month at the I
Fulton) and Jeremy Irons for Reversal of Fortune.

Overnight superstar Julia Roberts was nominated in the Best
Actress category for her Cinderella—esque role in Pretty Woman. Also

This Is An E.P. Release
Tommy Boy Records’

Remember “The Humpty
Dance” from last summer? Well,

_ the Digital Underground has just

put out a new six-song record

' called TbisIsAnE.P. Release. Two '

of the songs are from some
Warner Brothers flick called
Valleenvania (where the hell did
they come up with a title like
that’); two are remixes of songs
from its album Sex Packets;
another song is new vocals put
on top of another Sex Pacleets
tune, and one is a completely
new brainchild of Shock—G and
company. Obviously, fans
expecting another concept album
will be disappointed.

The two movie songs are “Same
Song” (the current single)» and
“Tie The Knot.” “Same Song”
sounds good, building a chorus

' of “All around the world/ It’s the

same song” on. top of some
samples and what sounds a little

an ear for the
finer things in

like the opening beats of
Aerosmith’s “Walk This Way.”
I’m not very good at reading
lyrics, but I think that it's about
the pressure on them to duplicate
the sound of “The Humpty
Dance.” Whatever it's about,
“Same Song” is cool. The other
movie song, (“Tie The Knot,” is
another story. In it, Humpty Hump
gets married but has cold feet at
the altar. The rest of the
Underground drops by and does
their worst to “Here Comes The
Bride,” leading Humpty to
exclaim that their singing is
“lousy.” Agreed.

Moving on to the remixes,
“Packet Man” shows a marked
difference, while “The Way We

Swing” shows more subtle .

changes. I kinda like the new
“Packet Man,” complete with sax
solos, pianos and strings. “The
Way We Swing” is good also.
Despite that, additional new songs
would have been more welcome
than two rehashes of Sex,Packets
material.

Another questionable addition

to this record is its closing. song

“Arguin’ On The Funk,” which is
different from “Rhymin’ On The
Funk” (from SexPac/eets) in much
the same way that Vanilla Ice’s
“Ice Ice Baby” is a different song
than “Under Pressure” by Queen
and David Bowie — nearly the
same music (or “Same Song”?),

Book   Deviews
Reading up on the Gulf war

By Nancy Marple
For The Pitt News

If you're interested in reading
about the Middle East, here are a
few of the many good books
available.

The Prize, Daniel Yergin. This

long, involved, extremely timely I

work on the history of oil
production and development is
essential reading for anyone who
wants to understand the real
reason why we are currently
defending Kuwait.’ Yergin has
boldly attempted to untangle the
history of the inﬂuence of oil on
power politics since the first well
was drilled in Pennsylvania.

Iraq: A Country Study, Federal
Research Division of the Library
of Congress. This amazingly
objective book, part of the federal
government’s Area Handbook
Series, provides a look at Iraqi
history, politics, religions and
other important cultural issues. It
is we1l—documented and
illustrated with photographs,
graphs and maps.

Iraq Since 1958, Marion Farouk
and Peter Sluglett. This rather dry
but very well- researched history
concentrates mainly on political
issues in Iraq, particularly the
Ba’thist takeover and the Kurdish
War. .

Human Rights in Iraq, Middle

East Watch. This book presents a
very ugly picture, indeed of the
Baa’th-led Iraqi government's
treatment of its citizens,
particularly the Kurdish minority.
The research and deadpan recital
of torture, mutilation,
assassination and imprisonment
were done by an obviously anti-
communist, anti-socialist
organization called Human Rights
Watch, which gives a decidedly
conservative bias to this book.

There have been several
paperbacks very quickly released
to coincide with the opening of
the war. The Rape of Kuwait by
Jean Sassoon, Saddam Hussein
and the Crisis in the Guljby Miler
and Mylvoie, and Republic ofFear
by Samir al—Khalil all lean toward
sensationalistic reports of war
crimes, human-rights violations,
rumors of Hussein’s drug
trafficking and unfavorable
comparisons between Iraq and
Kuwait. These books promote
hatred and bigotry to justify the
war but do very little to encourage
understanding.

Other related books are Assad,

the biography of the leader of ,

Syria, by Patrick Seal, which
delves deeply into Middle East
politics, and From Beirut to

In an age when women actors
hunt high and low for a halfway
decent film role, Mia Farrow
oughta feel damn lucky she has
Woody Allen for a boyfriend. In

“Allen’s films of the past decade,

we've seen Farrow’s transform-
ation from a cloyingly cute, rather
dimensionless performer to one
of impressive ability.

Allen’s new movie, Alice, is
Farrow’s showpiece — it’s a
wonderful script with a wonderful
role, and it also features her finest
performance to date. She plays a
pampered Park Avenue
housewife married to a handsome
but languid financier (William
Hurt). When Alice’s trainer and
masseuse can't remedy her back
pains, she goes to Chinatown in

...we’ll leave

The doctor tells her the back

pains are not from sickness in the _

body but from sickness “in the
head and the heart.” Under
hypnosis she reveals her
unhappiness. Her world revolves
around superficial comfort and
pleasant appearances, and deep
down it is very dissatisfying.

While under the doctor’s‘
treatment, Alice’s life changes ——
you could say she enters her own
“wonderland.” While picking up
her kids at school she meets a
divorced jazz musician (Ioe
Mantegna). Under the inﬂuence
of some special herbs, she is
visited by the ghost of a dead
lover (Alec Baldwin).

Aside from supplying some wild
humor, Alice’s magical excursions
teach her more about herself and
the people in her life. She gets
wise to her husband’s secret
activities. She re—establishes at

relationship with her strong,
ethical older sister (Blythe
Danner). Most importantly, she is
able to revive a part of her that
was good -—— a part of her that
wanted to help others — before

she became selfish and superficial. I

A couple of times during the
first hour I wondered how Allen
was going to keep the whole
thing from running out of gas.
But with a joke here, a poignant
confession there, he makes this

‘soul-searching journey as

compelling as it is offbeat.

Alice is a playful mishmash of
fantasy, jokes and Woody Allen’s
never-ending Search for Real
Meaning and True Values. The
film’s subject matter may seem

out of touch with most people’s
experience (a complaint about
most of Allen’s recent work).
But Alice is a hell of a lot more
relevant than Die Hard Hand 99.9

- percent of the crap coming out of

Hollywood.

And this is a woman’s film — a
real woman, whether you like
her or not. Allen has always had
a gift, much like his idol Ingmar
Bergman, for capturing women
on the screen.

As usual, Allen has assembled
an incredible cast. Mantegna plays
Farrow’s lover with the lowbrow
likability he specializes in. Hurt is
equally typecast and equally good
as her bland, good—looking
husband. Danner, Baldwin, Cybill

In the ’70s film critics put Allen
on a pedestal — probably
rejoicing that there was ﬁnally a
screen star that mirrored their
nerdiness. But since his 1980
movie Stardust Memories‘ the
party line on Allen is that he is too
“serious,” “pretentious” and “out
of touch.”

Last year’s Crimes and
Misdemeanors was a landmark

for the writer/director. He finally
arrived at the perfect prescription
—— jokes for sheer entertainment
and weighty ideas that the
audience could take home and .
discuss. He continues this trend
in Alice.

round out the current Crazy Horse
lineup.

Neil Young recruited the band
for work on his 1969 Reprise
release Everybody Knows this is
Nowhere. It was this initial
meeting that led to the name
Crazy Horse and also resulted in
the band’s association with Neil
Young, which has lasted over 18
years. During this period Crazy
Horse recorded over six albums

,with Neil, including classics like

Zuma and Rust Never Sleeps.

But what many don’t realize is
that Crazy Horse was busy with
its own projects and has released
six albums, including its most
recent, Left ForDead, on Sisapa
Records.

Talbot is as energetic and
industrious as he was when he
started his professional music
career back in 1963. “We’re rockin’
and rollin’,” he says of the current
tour.

Crazy Horse has been the
inspirational basis for sq many
recent bands, as well as the
mainstay of Neil Young & Crazy
Horse’s raucous, grungy sound.
The raw feedback that they create
might even be credited for
Young’s success.

Inevitably, the line dividing solo
Crazy Horse and its projects with
Neil has often been difficult to
distinguish, but never for very
long. Problems are easy to solve,
but trying to create your own
fame under the shadow of such a
monumental musician as Neil
Young is a bit more tedious.

“It's very frustrating to be
known as one of the world's
greatest rock ‘n’ roll bands and to
have people wonder if you can
do anything without Neil Young,”
says Talbot. “We’ve done plenty
without him and we’ll continue
to do things without him. We
know what we’re doing.”

Despite the pitfalls, Talbot
seems to be thoroughly enjoying

his current occupation. He-

wouldn’t have it any other way.

“I’m into playing rock’n’roll and
some day they’ll have to pull me
off the stage,” he says. “That’s
probably when I’ll die.”

Until that time, Talbot and Crazy
Horse will make the best of their
situation and enjoy their current
success. ,

"Ragged Glory is a great
album,” says Talbot. “What we’re
doing with Neil is Crazy Horse at
its best.”

Not to be forgotten in this
eclectic trio is Social Distortion.
SD started out in the Los Angeles
punk scene in the late ’70s. It
ﬂourished in the underground
with its ferocious, self-abusing
style.

That type of lifestyle can't last
long, though, as_singer Mike Ness
soon realized. After battling drug
and alcohol addiction, Ness
regrouped SD.

With a new outlook on life and
a fresh, slightly bluesy sound,
Social Distortion has been touring
the country in support of its latest
release on Epic.

All together, these three groups
Sbouldﬂut on quite a show. Neil
Young 6 Crazy Horse, Sonic
Youth and Social Distortion will
be performing at the Civic Arena
on Sunday, Feb. I 7.

THE Pl'I'l' NEWS, Thursday, February 14, 1991

 

Continued from page S-6
Foster's Clarice, relishing her visits
as his only means of contact with
the outside world. He exchanges
precious info for tales from
Clarice’s past, living vicariously
through her.

Foster's and Hopkins’
interactions are at the core of this
film, and she perfectly conveys
the desperate fear and quiet
resilience of the ambitious FBI
trainee. The chemistry and tension

‘ is ﬁlled with a dark, biting humor

and is tangible between the two.
Hopkins brings Lecter’s
sarcastic, arrogant side to the
_forefront, instantly putting the
audience in his back pocket
before the plot throws them some
wicked curves. Too bad it’s too
late for this year's Oscar race; this
a worthy performance.
Jodie Foster is instantly likable
in her role, and the audience

roots for her from the beginning.
She adopts auburn hair and an
adorable West Virginia accent,
immersing herself in the part of a
simple, smart woman who
becomes the conﬁdante of one
madman and the hunter of
another. The role allows her much
range, ‘especially when she
reflects on her ever-present
memories of her dead father and
her difficult childhood.

Especially poignant is the scene
in which she tells Lecter a story
from her childhood that explains
the ﬁlm's title. Foster racks up
another great performance in the
lead, taking a back seat to no one
as she cracks the case.

The case itself unfolds like an
artichoke being peeled apart with
tantalizing slowness, revealing a
warped heart at its center. Each
clue leads to another, and Clarice
follows the trail with an accuracy

that belies her inexperience.

Scott Glenn plays her boss,
Jack Crawford, and does a good
job with a thankless role. In the
book, Clarice carried a torch for
Crawford; I think Foster conveys
this subtly through her
awkwardness around him, but
it’s never explicit. Foster gets to
do what Sigourney Weaver did in
Aliens: carry a thriller, a
traditionally male—dominated
genre.

What about the Pittsburgh
locales? Well, I thought it was
neat seeing the scene they ﬁlmed
on my grandmother's street, along
with Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, but generally the city serves

as the background for some really
scummy people (like Ted Levine
as the sicko Buffalo Bill). The
locations in the ﬁlm range from
Ohio to Virginia, and a mutable
Pittsburgh ﬁts the background
well.

The preview audience I saw it
with had a blast, laughing at
Hannibal, rooting for Clarice and
shrieking with fear at the moves
of Buffalo Bill. Be warned: This
film is unflinching, sparing its
audience nothing — and the

8-9

audience ate it up. The tension
was palpable, especially in the
nail-biting climax where Foster
confronts the killer in his dark
sanctuary. (It calls to mind
Philadelphia's House-of-Horrors
murderer of a few years back.)
If you're up for an intelligent
detective story, a true
psychological thriller (an abused
term if ever there was one) and
some mega-performances from
two well-matched stars, go
experience Silence for yourself.

Continued from page S-5 “New Blue Moon,” a tribute to listening to this album over and i.Ci°"""*‘e?’f"°'"P“8e5'3i .9 9 D

The other 10 songs here are all
better than “She’s My Baby.”
There’s “7 Deadly Sins,” a sarcastic
love song which is similar in

— theme to “Congratulations” from

the first Wilburys album. There’s
also “Poor House,” a wonderful
hillbilly rocker with some
excellent vocal harmonizing. And
in “Where Were You Last Night,”
we get to hear Bob Dylan
exercising his characteristic
singing style of saying whatever
happens to rhyme, i.e., “Where
were you last week? Were you up
a creek?” .

Perhaps the best song here is

the late Roy Orbison, who was a
member of the Wilburys on their
first album. Dylan’s lyric of, “Too

many times the sun came up, but‘

it came up without you ...” ranks

_ among the best that he has done

in recent years.

The last track, “Wilbury Twist,”
is soridiculous that it’s funny (or
is it the other way around?) “You
put your hand on your head/ put
your foot in the air/ then you hop
around the room/ in your
underwear  Lift your other foot
up/ fall on your ass/ get back up/
put your teeth in a glass.”

Speaking of humor, after

over, I finally realized that “She’s
My Baby” is not really an attempt
at hitting the Top 40. Instead, it is
a parody of what is on the Top
40. When viewed in this context,
perhaps it’s not such a bad song
after all. ‘

It should be pointed out that
this album is not as good as the
Wilburys’ debut album. But such
a comment stems more from the
greatness of their first album than
it does from any problems with
their second. In general, Volume
3 is very enjoyable to listen to.
