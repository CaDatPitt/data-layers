uate Community Fund campaign has
raised $2,254.43 from 2,329 students,
J. G. Quick, registrar, chairman tof
the University’s general Community

Meanwhile, ‘reports from th,e’:gra"d--
uate schools and the faculty drive
continued to pour.in .as this after-
noon’s deadline for »pledges, ap-’-
proached. Only professional school
to report their results ‘as_ yet. was-. the

results are as yet, far‘

more incomplete, Mr. 'Qu'icl€.°‘stated: ‘

The total of $3,498.50~which has been
reported‘ fromf some departments.’ has
been very encouraging,‘ ass it'"re”p're-
sents; half‘ of‘ the total budget. N '3

From these reports, Mr. "Quick
holds all expectations of meeting
the $10,000. goal set for the com-
bined student-faculty Community

According to William W. Menden-'
hall, executive secretary of the
YMCA, the vice chairman of the stu-
dent drive committee, the results of
the student drive promises that the
goal of $2,700 will be exceeded.

There remains but $300 yet to be
raised, and the Schools "of Medicine,
Pharmacy, and Law have not yet re-
ported. There are also many" stu-
dents in the undergraduate schools
who have not yet been reached, Mr.
Mendenhall saaid.

rough-neck camp. They are all ﬁne
boys. They bring to us a concrete
example of what my philosophy
teaches, ‘you can do it if you want
to.’ ” . s ,

Other parts of his 45-minute talk
were concerned with a restatement
of his philosophy of life. He feels
that we Western people are lopsided
in our education, contrasting us with
the Chinese. He believes that 95
per cent‘ of college education has to
do with material things in life. ‘_‘On
the other hand, the Chinese are bal-
anced. They are not afraid of any-
thing. They are happy.”

Dr. Bowman also described some
of his experiences in China last sum-
mer, gave his interpretation of Heinz
Chapel “stained windows, and com-
mented on “good manners.”

“IT'S EASY TO KILL . . . if no one suspects you." There’s the
secret behind quiet Wychwood’s “accidental” deaths. Read what 3
