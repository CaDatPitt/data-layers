City Survey
To Study
Parking

Plans to help clear up the
parking congestion around the
Cathedral are in an advanced

stage of development.

The second part of a survey be-
gun l.ast January by the Pittsburgh
Regional Planning Association in
Oakland got underway today as
the first cars pulled into the area.

 Froelich, chief planning
engineer of the association, said
that drivers‘ were asked three
questions to determine where they
came from, why they came to Oak-
land, and their destination in Oak-
land.

Cooperation Asked

Froelich asked that all Pitt
students, many of whom will be
included in the survey, to co-
operate with the Central Catholic
High School students who will act
as surveyors. .

The 15-hour survey is being
undertaken in cooperation with
the City’s bureau of traffic plan-
ning. Surveys are taken to deter-
mine thelnormal pattern of traffic
foruse in pl-anning new arteries to
Oakland and parking facilities.

Meanwhile a spot check made
by News reporters last week
showed that both students and

traffic planners are partially to

blame for parking congestion.

Students came in for their share
of the blame by the haphazard
parking habits practiced by many
of them. In radius of about 139
yards around the Cathedral 40 cars
were parked in such a way as to
take up two, and in some cases,
three, lined parking spaces.

Illegal Parking Habitual

Ten cars were parked illegally,
despite the fact that there were
legal parking spaces nearby.
Illegal parking seems to be a habit
for four‘ cars were observed in
yellow-line areas at 7:45 a.m. last
Friday when plenty of space was
available.

That the City is not entirely
blameless is shown by the poor
condition of the lines on Bigelow
Boulevard and the Schenley Park
lot. These lines are all but erased
in many places and also conflict
with lines placed previously.

The new lines were reportedly
laid down last year.

How so many cars get parked
with disregard to set lines remains
a mystery, for all the students
queried in the News check claimed
they always observe parking lines-

Nomination Petitions

Accepted by Council  

A steady flow of signedpetitions fornomination to Men’s Coun-
cil is coming in to the dean of men’s office, according to Edwin

J. _l.1cIntosh, I3'.C advisor.

«.

The only part of the school whichis not sending in a full nuota
of petitions is the Engineering and Mines School, Mr. Mclntosh

said. Council President Howard
Greenberger was to communicate
with the Engineering and Mines As-
sociation about the encouragement
of petitions from that school.

All men students who will have
attained sophomore standing by next
semester are eligible for nomination
to Council.

50 Names Required

Petition blanks may be obtained
in the dean of men's office, and 50
names must be signed on each blank
before they‘ are turned in. Signed
petitions will be accepted in the
dean of men's office as late as April
A Men’s-Council committee made
up of seven seniors and one member
of a lower class will meet on April
5 to narrow the number of nominees
down to the constitutional number of
four candidates per each position
open.

This committee will consider all
the petitions and choose from among
the nominees those who would ap-
parently make better members of
Council. If the number of petitions
for any position on Council is less

than four, then every nominee for
that position will be a candidate in
the election April 19.

16 Positions Open

According to calculations made
by Howard Greenberger, 16 posi-
tions on Council must be filled in
the next elections.

Four positions on Council are not
open to election, since that number
of members was recently elected in-
ternally to Council.

formerly slated for location on

the top floor of the new center
building, has now been moved to a
basement room which will be con-
structed between the adjacent cen-
ter and gymnasium buildings.
These two structures are a part
of the multi-million dollar Pitt
building expansion program which
will result in four new buildings on
the Cathedral campus when work
is completed. Also to be built are
a library building to be located on
the Forbes Street side of the cam-
pus and the George Hubbard Clapp
Science Hall directly «opposite and
bounding on Fifth Avenue.

Fitzgerald ‘Suggestion

The shift in dance floor location .
results from an earlier suggestion
by Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
to that effect. Shortly before the
announcement of the change.
rumors had sifted onto campus
that the gymnasium and the center
buildings were to be consolidated
into. one structure.

In structure the two buildings
will remain separate. However,
through the medium of the under-
ground dance floor which will be
constructed as acombination dance
floor-gymnasium, some of the faci-
lities of the two will be inter- ,
woven.

The center and the gym building‘.
are to be located side by side be-
tween the Cathedral and Heinz
Chapel, present plans show. The
dance floor-gym will then be built
in a basement-level room-between
the two according to Jackson.

Problem Solved
.This location will help solve a
problem which many educational
institutions face-that ofinsuffi-A
cient use of facilitieswhich are
already on hand. The dance-floo‘r
gym will be available for social
functions when needed. ’ During
the rest of the time, when ordina-
rily the floor would be unused,
classes from the physical educa-
tion department will take over.
According to Jackson, the pre-
sent architectural change will
greatly increase the facilities for
activities and recreation in the
new student center by releasing
the entire top floor of the building
to other use.

Disrnay

March 17,1950 carried a scare head-
line story concerning a local judge’s
opinion of Dr. Marion Hathway .True,
the article did infer that Judge Gun-
ther’s statements were unfounded,
but nevertheless, I view with dismay
this evidence of my Alma Mater join-
ing in any part of the red hysteria
which is now so prevalent. Since the
News d0es.not have to depend on
sensationalism ‘for its extensive
circulation-why should it stoop to
cheap journalistic methods?

Judge Gunther’s sullen punch line
seems to have been that Dr. Hathway
teaches "the young folks here that
there is something wrong with this
country.” You might have asked the
Judge which government, the demo-
cratic or the totalitarian forbids the
entertaining or teaching of such
ideas. As an authority in her field,
Dr. Hathwa_.y would, of course, have
constructive criticism to make. When
I was taking graduate social work at
Pitt, Dr. Hathway was, and I’m sure
still is quite positive in her class-
room and all othefdiscussions, help-
ing her students to see the many ram-
ifications of social action and leg-
islation and encouraging them to
formulate their own opinions on mat-
ters of public interest. I know that
any criticalistatements that she ever
made were those of any of us who
consider that the government ofthese
United States is very definitely our
concern. It goes without saying that

cause somebody sees "something
wrong” and tries to improve it.

Couldn't you on the News staff
have discerned the distortion in
Judge Gunther’s statements -and have
either placed the "story” according-
ly in your March 17 lay-out or dis-
missed it completely?

Mock elections, cheers, campaign
speeches, and perhaps even strains
of “Wintergreen for President”
will be heard Friday, March 31
when the coed classes compete at
the “Tammany Take-off” rally at
3:30 p.m. in Stephen Foster Memo-

The rally is sponsored by the

mittee. Headed by Gerry Pendro,
the committee hopes to stimulate
interest in women’s elections.

High points of the rally will be
skits and campaign songs presented
by the four women’s classes. The
theme for the skits and songs will
be mainly a satire on high-pressure
political campaigning. The pattern
will be similar to the annual Inter-

Members of the faculty will act

as judges and a prize will be
awarded to the class -with the most

Totaled, the gifts amount to 391

of the yearly mail. The magazines
of 46 national fraternities also are
on the shelves.

The most puzzling of the gifts
that "Postman” Eugene Szaronos
brings in daily is the newspaper
“New Korea.” Apparently it just
arrives; why or where from is not
certain.

The first and only reader of the
paper which has been in the Uni-

fidei Korean student who visited
the periodical room, regularly last
year. So ‘far this year he has not re-
turned. He just disappeared, but
the paper keeps coming.

Also, the school board should
be aware of physical conditions
under which the employees work.

Any physical limitation of the
working environment should be
alleviated to obtain high ef-

“Above all, it must be taken.
into consideration that the jobs of
the custodians and clerical workers

have educational implications
too,” he added.
However, he emphasized that

"no amount of leadership in rank

leadership in administration.”

’”The administration must ac-
cept its tremendous responsibility
and use its great opportunity to
improve the educational system.”
"It must search continuously
and diligently for new talent. It

Pool Open But
Students Stuck

The fairy tale about tar babies
is read to children, but at Pitt
it seems that the only ones who
hear anything about tar are the
students who swim in remodeled
Trees pool.

The pool, closed since before
Christmas, was reopened when
the repairmen finally got around
to filling the cracks with black
tar.

The first group of swimmers
dived in last week and found
themselves sticking to the floor
of the pool. The tar not only
dressed the soles of the swim-
mers’ feet, but spotted their
bodies also.

B)’ STAN SKIRBOLL

It doesn't take anyone with a
2.9 quality point average to tell
you that a basketball court is not
made for football.

All it takes for Len Casanova
and his board of assistants to find
out how unsuitable the basketball
court is, is obnoxious weather.

Last week the varsity came out--
75 strong. And along with the grid-
ders the rains came. With some
snow mixed in. All of which made
for highly undesirableplaying con-
ditions on Trees Field, which is
already highly undesirable.

take his squad into the Stadium

seem too crowded while the boys

The head coach divided ,
squad into seven teams. He put
four teams-three offensive and one
defensive-at one circle, and two

I offensive and one defensive teams

at the other foul circle.

Then they ran through plays. How
serious collisions were avoided
proves to‘be a mystery as well as
an example of excellent broken
field running.

It is needless to say that the en-

tire coaching staff welcomed
Monday’s sunhy weather.
Meanwhile, three members from

Don Fisher's second squad were
moved up to work out with the
varsity. Two are from last year’s
team, while one is a transfer stu-

Slab Candidates Po

..*#=I

se Real
M itterl ing

By JOHN MEGELLA

After five weeks of baseball drills, Pitt’s slab situation, unlike the

morgue variety, is a hot affair.
Just what pitchers will toe the s

lab for the Panthers when the season

begins is the hottest question of pre-season drills. Coach Ralph Mitter-

ling has a dozen candidates from whom to choose his mound staff.

To Cut Over Half

The Pitt coach said, “I expect to
carry four'0r five pitchers this year.
Who they’ll be I don't know. They
all look good in workouts at the bull-
pen. What they show with regular
outdoor work will decide which four
or five of the twelve will pitch.”

Five holdovers from last year’s
team, Larry Brent, Rudy Htzdec , Phil
Sweet, Bill V012, and Elmer Guckert,
are among the aspiring moundsmen.

Brent, a fast ball pitcher, ‘won
three games and lost one last year.
Hume, who won two games last sea-
son, starts his third year as a Pan-
ther mittmen. Both Hudec, a knuckle-
ball artist, and Brent are righthanders.

Guckert A Southpaw
Guckert is the only lefthander
among the pitching candidates. A
curve ball specialist, he was side-
lined by sickness and injuries early

Mitterling’s problem. arises from the ‘fact that these 12 men, all of
whom have shown well in practice, can’t be carried as pitchers.

Amazing Scores Fired

Under Honor System 

Members of the Pitt varsity rifle team are amazed at the recent
newslast week that Duquesne University had won the Second Army
match and the first three team places in the national rifle cham-
pionships sponsored by the Hearst newspapers.

On the basis of the Filltoppers’ showings again st Pitt, Coach
Watts Shablowski of thePanthers terms their scores,‘ "impossible."

The matches were conducted by mail, using the honor system.

‘Probably Prone’ _

"They probably shot all their
targets in prone position,” de-
clared Pitt riflemen. Previously
the Dukes had lost two matches to
the Panthers in regular city com-
petition this year, yet they made a
far better showing than Pitt's
marksmen in the Hearst affair.

The Panther riflemen, mean-
while clinched their second
straight Greater Pittsburgh League
title Thursday, outshooting
Carnegie Tech, 1395-1364. They
chalked up eight wins without a

defeat this year against Tech,
Duquesne, California State Tea-
chers, and Washington and Jef-
ferson.

The GPL victors are entitled

to fire in the National Rifle As-

sociation’s state championships in
April.

Go To Columbus
A trip to Ohio State for the NRA
Intercollegiate Sectionals is slated
for this weekend. The team will
leave for Columbus, Ohio, Friday
and fire Saturday, April 1.
Individuals scores for the Tech
match were:
John Dibler, 283; Don Furman,
281; Howard Newman, 280; Norman

Orendowski, 276; Robert Davis,
275. Dibler boasts the highest
average forlthe eight matches,

Oakland Title
Still Pitt’s

A second half switch in defense
gave the Dazzling Dukes a 57-54
victory over Tech’s Emanons and
the all-Oakland toga on the Trees
court Friday.

To keep the all-Oakland honor
in Pitt hands for the fourth con-'
secutive year, the Pitt represen-
tatives had to fight off a half
time deficit of three points. Coach E I
Lesko’s change to the man for 
defense bottled Emanon high ‘
scorer Pete Katsafanas to assure
victory in the second half.

Andy Brinsko and Moranz were
high scorers for the Dukes with 14
and 13 points respectfully.

TENNIS CALL
Candidates for the varsity tennis
team are requested to report to
Ben Grady at the Athletic Office
today at 3 p.m.

 

JACK l-IARDMAN is the only
student to serve in a dual-manager
capacity. Jack manages both the
swimming and tennis teams.

last year.

Also available to Mitterling is
Frank Rapariello, an ex-hurler mak-
ing abid for an infielvdberth. Pressed
into service as a pitcher late last
season, Papariello won two games.

A promising newcomer to__the ranks
is righthander Bob ,'Russell. A soph-

 How VVill Our
Field House
Stack Up?

By Dave Pollock

In comparison to some of the super structures
that have been built lately or are now being built,
Pitt’s proposed field house will be nothing but a
hot dog stand.

There are three measurements that can be
used in calling the future Panther sports center
a hot dog stand in comparison with others.

1 - Cost of -field house

2 - Seating capacity for basketball

3 - Undergraduate enrollment and the popula-
tion of the district which makes up the bulk of
the school's’ attendance.

The figures used in this survey have been
gathered in a Pitt News nation wide poll of 44
leading schools.

Kentucky Seats 12,000

In round numbers, Pitt’s field house is ex-
pected to cost close to $1,350,000 and seat up-
wards of 7,000. Compare this with the University
of Kentucky’s' $4,000,000 Memorial Coliseum
seating 12,000 fans.

What makes Kentucky's combination auditor-
ium-field house stand out above Pitt’s is a com-
parison of the undergraduate enrollment of the
two schools and the population of the districts
surrounding each of them.

Here, the undergraduate enrollment is now
close to 11,200.. Kentucky has 7,000 undergrad-
uates. The Greater Pittsburgh district has over
1,500,000 citizens while the Greater Lexington
district shows 75,000.

Pitt’s planned field house won’t be able to
seat more than 62 per cent of it’s students. Ken-
tucky can not only take care of all its under-.

     
 
 
  
   

 

Fifteen thousand fans jam Michigan 3tate’s Ienison Field House for state high school championship game.

 

 

graduates, but it can seat one out of
every twenty-five citizens in the
Greater Lexington district.

It's about the same story with many
other field houses completed during

the last decade.

Rice Institute is building a field
house now.Thecostwill be$1,5 00,000.
Rice will only be able to seat 6,600,
but the undergraduate enrollment is
only 1,500.

The University of Minnesota's Will-
iam's Arena makes Pitt’s proposed
field house look like an Outhouse.
Built in 1928, a new roof added in
1948, and remodeled in 1949, the

Gopher Arena has now cost$1,873,l69.
Though Minnesota has 25,000 under-
graduates and only 18,925 seats, Jt’s

still better off than Skycraper U.
Around 72 per cent of Minnesota’s
undergraduates can attend a game com-
pared to our 62 per cent.

Michigan State constructed a field
house in 1940 at a cost of $1,108,000,
a little cheaper than "Pitt’s proposed

'job, but building costs were much

cheaper then. And State can seat
15,000. The undergraduates number
16.000.

The same situation applys to Pur-
due University. The Boilermakers
b-uilt a combination classroom-field
house in 1938 at a cost of $1,000,000.
Even though construction costs were
cheaper at that time, it is felt by many
in the building trade that Purdue got
a big bargain.

' 10,000.

Undergraduate enrollment at Pur-
due is 13,800. The field house seats
Boilermaker officials have
the students altern_ate in attending
the basketball games, half the under-
graduates attending one game and the
other half the next. ‘

This leaves roughly 3,000 seats for
public sale. Many other schools use
the same sort of system.

Pitt will be far from outclassed in
the matter of field houses when the
building is finished some time during
the next basketball season, ‘probably
early in 1951. It is only in comparing

-it with some of the super jobs that the

future Panther sports center falls short.

A young couple who have shown
their “Theater of Great Personali-
ties” throughout the country, will
entertain students at the Student
Congress sponsored program tomor-
row.

The pair, Hal and Ruby Holbrook,
will give three sketches from their
repertoire of scenes from the lives
of great figures o.£.drama and life at
2:30 p.m. in Stephen Foster Memorial.

For tomorrow’s program, they will
present scenes from the high point
in the lives ofMark Twain, the Brown-
ings, and Queen Elizabeth and Lord
Essex. The three 12 to 15 minute
scenes follow each other in rapid
succession, and changes of costume,
make-up, and characterization are
quickly made.

One of the two artists appears be-

fore the curtain between each scene

to introduce the next, giving a back-

, ground for the following sketch and

a continuity to the whole program.

This is the last of the. programs
planned by Congress which will pre-
sent ‘live’ entertainers, according to
Dave Fox, chairman of the assem-
blies committee of Student Congress.

Scheduled as assemblies for the
remainder of the‘ semester are the
movies to be given in Stephen Fos-
ter without charge. Dates and pro-
grams will be announced in later edi-
tions of the News.

ONE OF THREE -- Hal and Ruby Holbrook portraying a scene from
Browning, one of three classics which will be recreated Wednesday at
Stephen Foster for the Student Congress-sponsored program.

 

Charles H. Ebert head of the Uni-
Placement Service, says. that sta-
tistics and mathematically precise
job outlook charts mean almost no-
thing in individual cases. His idea
is you can’t keep a good man down.

Firms Seek Professionals

“The firms that come to Pitt to
hold job interviews are looking for
professional men who know their
stuff and have the ability to direct
and organize.”

" A qualified man finds no lack of
good jobs. Our men who realize that
just sitting in class for four years
doesn't make them engineers can
usually find employment.”

Ebert had altwo-inch stack of
cards on his desk listing» open
positions. He explained that some

,. were positions for which men with

the ink still wet on their sheepskins
would not be eligible. Others were
jobs involving a lot of travel or
sales work on straight commission,
decent jobs but not appealing for
the average graduate.

Sales Engineers Needed
“Sales engineers are in great.

Job Outlook Dark But..
Good Engineers Needed

The U.S. Labor Departnient paints a gloomy picture of the job
outlook for engineers graduating in 1950.

,A record crop of $0,000 will graduate this June, compared with
a pre-war average of 10,000. Competition for jobs will be sharp
for the next few years according to the department’s statistics.

market,” Ebert pointed out.

Ebert can’t urfderstand the lack of
interest shown by the majority of
the engineers in extra-curricular
activities, especially in their own
groups like the student affiliate of
the American Chemical Society.

"Many students belong, but how
many take a really active part? How
many ever get out and write a paper
on their own?” he asks. V

The labor report also points out
that graduates who don’t get into

-engineering at once will find their

schooling helpful in other lines.
Those who can go on with their
studies instead of waiting for a
job stand to earn considerably more.

' J Wages Increased

Take-home pay for the beginner
has increased in comparison with
the pay of the men established in
the field. ~»Another encouraging
statement says that engineering is
one of the fastest growing profes-
sions. ,

There are indications that as the
number of veteran students dimini-
shes within the next few years,

demand in this post-war Competitive

demand may actually exceed supply.

A request for this type of program
came out of the Religion-in-Life

principal speakers. His subject at
the conference was “What the Jews
Believe.” 1
