President Power Feared  

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Congressmen, especially liber-
als, are afraid to stand up to
presidential power, just as they
have been throughout the last two
decades, Delaware Democratic
Senator Joseph Biden said Monday
night at Pitt.
Biden, who at the age of 29

{ﬁljecame the youngest U.S. Senator

ever elected, told his Benedum
Hall audience that as a result of
this fear, Congress has shown no
initiative in structuring foreign
‘ policy and is unable to work as an
equal partner with the executive
branch of government.

“We liberals are the ones who
gave you a more powerful
-president,” Biden said, “and we
are now giving you an impotent
Congress.”

_ Biden, a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said he was

. disappointed by the reluctance of

Congress to question the president

,-"“;,J3n policy stands, especially on

‘current foreign issues.

“The government continues to-

prop up dictatorships, ignore
Africa and close its eyes to the
goings-on in India,” he said.
“Nothing is changing, yet we go
around and beat our breasts about
how the system works,

“One of the myths ﬂoating
around these days in this post-
Watergate era is that the system
has been vindicated and we have
redressed the imbalance that
existed between the legislative and

Br BILL MOORE

Complete revision of the
present structure of Student
Government is being studied by the
Constitutional Review Committee
as a possible means of increasing
student inﬂuence in University
actions.

A public forum will be held
Friday from noon to 3 p.m. in the
S.U. Kurtzman Room to give
students and administrators the
opportunity to express their views
on the workings of the present

executive- branches, but the ugly
fact is that we are as equally
imbalanced today as we were in
1972 and 1973.”

In order to correct the disporpor-
tions in U.S. government, Biden
said, -. Congress must take the
initiative, ignoring its fear of
institutions and vested interest
groups. _

Biden was sarcastic when he
spoke about this Congressional
task.

“We good-guy liberals are afraid
of opposing special interest groups

and changes that could be made.

“We will probably do a rewrite
of the entire constitution,” Consti-
tutional Review Committee Chair-
man Jack Romberg said. “Right
now, the Board has no basis of
power on which to base its
actions.”

Romberg explained the commit-
tee will be looking for ways to

broaden the membership of the-

Board, or for some alternative
structure, and also for ways to
broaden the student support given
the Board. _

 

Michael/Meeropol:

Reopen the Rosenberg Case

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

The reopening of the Rosenberg
case is “part and parcel” of the
campaign to expose government
secrecy and deceit, Michael Meer-
opol said in David Lawrence hall
last night. ' c

The son of executed atomic
spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,
Meeropol has been trying to clear
his parents’ name for _ several
years.

He maintained this policy is
formed by a small ruling circle, in
order to protect its own interests.
The Rosenberg case, he said, is an
example of selected repression.

“We don't have a great police
state apparatus to keep all the
people down; we have a small
police state apparatus to keep some
of the people down,” he said.

The Rosenberg case was an
attempt by the government to
convince the American public that
communism was a threat to
America, and that the way to
counter this, threat was with
belligerency. Anyone opposing this
policy—the left wing—had to be
cowed _into submission.

“Here was proof of all the things
that the House Committee on
Un-American Activities and Joe
McCarthy were saying—here is the

danger to our national security.” K,

The publicity generated by this
case, Meeropol claimed, caused
the average citizen to identify
dissent with disloyalty. This is the
‘basis, he said, of everything about
which we are angry today.

“Whenever people were con-
fronted by dissenters, they put
them in a box that had been
constructed by the Rosenberg
case.”

z-23G Structure Being Studied   

“The possibilities aren’t limit--
ed,” Romberg said. “We could go
to a legislative system, or just
expandjthe present Board, -or go
into a -representative system of
organizations.” ' V

Friday’s forum, according to
Romberg, is planned to permit
interested persons to express
support for or complaints about the
Board and its committees.

Romberg said_ he doubted the
seven-man committee would be
able to present a proposal in time
for the Student Government

(Continued on Page 3) -

Meeropol recalled that soon after
his parents had been convicted, a
friend’s mother forbade him from
ever coming back to their house.

“She was terriﬁed that her son
would be
communist eight-year-old. ”

As more facts about the case
were uncovered, the arguments of
the prosectution have grown
weaker, Meeropol. asserted. One
example of twisted evidence that
Meeropol gave was a table Julius
Rosenberg had bought for $21 at
Macy’s in 1945.

The prosecution claimed this
table was a gift from the Soviet
Union and had a secreticompart-
ment for microfilms. After the trial
it was confirmed the table was from
Macy's. Meeropol’s aunt had held
the table in her basement, afraid to
be associated with the trial.

The prosecution's star witness,
Harry Gold, also was discredited,
Meeropol said. -.

“Gold was the proverbial nut
who whenever there is a big crime,
walks in and says ‘I did it.'”

Gold, it seems, had woven an
elaborate story about his wife and
two brothers, and how he had
traveled from Albuquerque, N.M.,

to New York in order. to deliver.

secret documents."
‘ According to Meeropol, Gold

contaminated by a I

was a bachelor with only one
brother, and according to the train
schedule of the day, it would have
been impossible for him to get
across country.in the time he
claimed.

Anti-‘Semitism played a part in»

the case by helping to isolate the
defendants, making them more
vulnerable to suspicion, Meeropol
said. Further, the trial fed existing
anti-Semitism, helping to quiet
liberal Jewish leaders who normal-
ly would have been very outspoken.

“Whenever the government
frames someone for political
purposes,” Meeropol explained,

“it is necessary to have a minority _

implicated.” A
Meeropol said that the campaign
to reopen his parents’ case already
had reaped some successes. He
sees the recent “leak” to the press

that his father had confessed to J

another prisoner and the attempt of

the government to charge him,

$23,000 for the case documents as
desperate attempts to protect
government secrecy.

“It is clear thatwhen they do

things like leak hot stories, it shows
that we're hurting them.”

Everyone should know about the -

facts of the case, Meeropol said, so
that everyone can help preventthe
government from doing the same
things again. I

¢Livewire: Student Protests Audio-VisualJob Ax

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

A student recently fired from his job as part-time
projectionist/operator with the University’s Communica-
tion Center has voiced his complaint about the unfairness
of the dismissal.

“I was fired for reasons that were never even hinted at
before," the student said. “I was under the impression I
was doing a good job." ’

The student said the job loss resulted in a substantial
loss of income,for him.

Audio Visual Services Coordinator David Majernik gave

“the reasons for the firing as “insubordination, lack of
»'-ﬂéeooperaltion and bad attitude.”

“It’s not my position to publicize a litany of things he did.
wrong,” Majernik said. “I had nothing personal against
' him." ‘ '

The student was against some restrictive policies
recently _instituted, according to Majernik. “If -he would
have performed like other people, showed up on jobs and
wasn’t against policy, it would have been all right,”
Majernik said. '

He also said he gave the student the opportunity to
resign. “He went to Legal Services and that sort of forced

my hand to fire him,” Majernik said. “I feel I’v_e dealt with .

him honestly.”

"The student appealed to the director of the

Communications Center, David Crossman, and to the

Provost’s Office.’ Both upheld the dismissal.
“He (Majernik) gave me what I considered to be a

justifiable cause to ﬁre the student,” Crossman said. .“I
support the actions of my staff unless I find there is some
reason not to.”

The Provost’s Office decided the question of whether the
supervisor fired the student for appropriate reasons,
according to Assistant to the Provost Ray’ Steele. “After
getting different perspectives and getting to the bottom of
everything, it became a matter of judgement,” Steele said.

“I gave the recommendation‘ to the provost, which he
accepted, that Majernik had acted appropriately and within
his authority.”

The appeal was taken to the Provost’s Office because
Crossman reports to the provost concerning the

communication Center, according to Steele. “The student-
can obviously go the Chancellor’s Office, the Board of
Trustees and the courts beyond that if he wants to,” Steele‘
said. ‘-‘The chances of the Chancellors’ Office overriding a»
decision by the Provost’s Office are slim but it can
happen. pt _ '

Senator Biden Claims
President Power Feare

Earth and the Sierra Club when we
think we will hurt our voting
records,’.’ he said.

Congress, according to Biden,
also has a poor record on initiating
domestic policy,_ because it fears
tackling areas he called “sacred
cows.”

Biden said issues such as busing
and institutions such as voting
within Senate committees were not
being questioned by Congressmen
as they should be;

“Liberals in Congress are afraid
to say what they believe,” Biden
said, “and the U.S. "electorate
knows better than to believe the
Then only 40%
shows up at the polls since the
electorate thinks the candidates are
stupid, they’re "robbers and that
they’re really all the same.”

The electorate and the Congress
have allowed a corruption of power
to build up in the . presidency
because of their reluctance to
challengeit and follow through on
that challenge, Biden added.

“Unless we liberals get on the
stick,” Biden warned, “we’re
going to be right back again losing
it (the fear of corruption) as we did
in the late 1960s.”

In response to a question from‘

the audience, Biden said Congress
must catch up with the current

. j-— mood of the American people and
' re-establish

the principles ~ of

integrity and constitutional law.

Ex-Senator Wayne Morse, one of
the most outspoken opponents of
the Vietnam war, was cited by
Biden as an example of a
Congressman who was ahead of his
time and who stood up for these
principles ahead of his time.

“People didn’t reward Morse as
they should have,” Biden. “But
today people want his kind of
honesty.”

In answer to another question,
Biden outlined the reason for the
buildup of presidential power.

“The president is ascribed
power the Congress doesn’t want
to handle,”lHe said. “Because it’s
easier for one man to organize than
435, many times the power is
passed to the president.

“The myths of organized religion
have also crumbled in this century
and they haven’t been supplanted
by other things—so the president is
believed in.”  .

Biden also commented on
President Gerald Ford’s intellec-
tual capacity, saying it was a
question now and, more important-
ly, would be a question in next
year's presidential election.

“Ford is still a congressman,”
Biden said. “He doesn’t have the

intellectual capacity of Nixon, but '

maybe that’s good. In sum, I don’t
think Gerald Ford is an intellectual
heavy.”

Biden’s appearance was spon-
sored by the College Young
Democrats.

Platt said the changes could

Deep Th roat s Quixo e
 does the president of a student group as harmless as the
Ainateur Radio Association (ARA) manufacature the biggest potential
rnoijal quest on ‘campus since the denial of CAS credit for ROTC?

’ Seeking to show Deep Throat at Pitt to raise money to buy necessary
equipment for the ARA, Sanford Silverberg requested an emergency
allocation of $600 to book the ﬁlm. After the four planned showings in
David Lawrence Hall, ARA proﬁts would amount to an estimated
$1,700., Yet all the ARA needed ‘for the equipment was $80. '
"77There are few good things, if any, to say about ambitious student
leaders who will invoke morality as a cover for their cupidity.
:‘''They would have funds allocated over and above an organization’s

acutall need, enabling the student activities fee and the Student
Government Allocations Committee to become instruments for proﬁt

. Leaders of this sort should bear in mind the difﬁculties the
allocations system has undergone this year. For - one think, an
emergency allocation couldn’t be made to send several students to a
f‘* conference against racism because the system is structured in such ‘a
-«,.»way that its allocators didn’t know for sure how much money was

Another point is that the Student Government Board (SGB) currently_
is trying to gain control over the interest generated by the activities

vvisubsisting, but of inventing ways to accumulate proﬁt. ’

, ‘ So naturally it was expected that Silverberg would yell foul play

 proﬁteering to morality was the only alternative he had to keep his

"7 Securing an SGB resolution supporting the ARA in its efforts to show
, Deep Throat on campus only makes Silverberg’ efforts appear more h
: futile. This is, ﬁrst, because he originally blasted Student Government
 —‘ for making what he called a moral decision (so how valuable could its

support be?) and, second, because the ARA has no valid reason to

 ‘ As of the 1960s, U.S. imperial-

} ism. could no longer afford
‘economically and politically to
remain the sole policeman of the
so-called “free world.” A change

 ‘V in global policy was called for. In

' its comprehensive formulation in

I  ‘ 1970, this new global strategy came
' ' ‘ to beknown as the Nixon Doctrine.

To the U.S. installed pupppet
alllies, the U.S. was saying that it
recognized they ._were threatened
from within by their people but it
.could not afford to plunge into

I another Vietnam so soon. Hence
_the U.S. would providethe needed
military aid and training, but the
-ﬁght against the national liberation

. movements is going to be fought,

I " at least initially, by local puppet

states. _
7 Let us consider.the consequen-

_' I ces, speciﬁcally in relation to the

 Arab/Persian Gulf and the Arab-
,  Israeli conflict. The Arab/Persian -
 1. Gulf region holds about two-thirds

of the world’s known oil reserves.
. Western Europe depends for 70%
’ andfJapan for 90% of its oil on the
Gulf. Whereas the_U.S. presently
imports_ about 20% of its con-
sumption from 5the area, it is
estimated that this dependence will
rise to 50% by 1980.

. Clearly, the economic impor-
tance of the Gulf area cannot be
overemphasized. With the British
“withdrawal” of 1971, the role of

‘ ‘-‘«-protection” of this staggering
’ imperialist economic interest was
assigned to the two local puppet

. _. _. states, ‘Saudi Arabia and Iran.

__ A_ mammoth program of militar-
ization got underway to the point
that Iran is presently buying $6
‘billion worth of arms annually,‘ with
the Saudis following in their steps.

’ .hThe sale of these ultra-modern

— weapons on such an unprecedeiited

scale not only helps the West's-

balance of payments and keeps its
armament industry in full swing,
but is primarily intended to help
put down the growing movements
for national liberation in the area.

A Omani national liberation struggle,

1967, a major cause of concern for

the existing imperialist interests
and possibly their expansion. To
their aid in implementing such
schemes has recently come Sadat
of Egypt with his interim agree-
ment.

During the patriotic war of

« October, 1973, Syria, Egypt, and

the Palestinians achieved an
effective level of unity. This unity
enabled them to strike effective
blows against the Israeli occupation
of territories seized in 1967. The
war and the subsequent dramatic
upsurge of Palestinian struggle for
national liberation within and
without the occupied territories,
and the international recognition of
this struggle as a just one, on the
one hand, and the growing unity
within the Arab ranks, on the
other, invoked great fears for the
imperialist powers and gave rise to
elaborate plans of conspiracy and

A column and a hat

JackLearns to Be a Fan

BY JOHN METCALFE _
Last Saturday J ack_and I had _a splendid adventure.
We went to the football game. A

“What football game?”
ask such a question? As far as I know, there was only
one that day. We went for a number of curious
reasons.

_ First was the coupon plan. I have been a student

for a while, andeall that time I .could have gotten
tickets to Pitt football games at no charge. I did not.

I was not interested. Then, the coupon plan was
introduced. Out of little more than cussedness, I

asked-for a book of coupons and got one. I observed ,

that my color fell early in the distribution for the
Notre Dame game and then forgot all about football.
Meanwhile Jack was getting bigger. He has been
my excuse for the pause of nearly two years in this
column. Now he sometimes lets me type. With his
maturity he has acquired some odd tastes. One of
them is for “parade music.” H ’
He is two and a- half. I must respect his wishes.
Both Pitt and Notre Dame are considered to have
good marching bands. . I cashed in my coupon.
We were not on time. Indeed, when we left the
house, the game had been on the radio so long that
the score was 14-13 in favor of Pitt. By the time we
reached the stadium, the score was 24-13, and it was

' nearly halftime.

That was what we -had come for. Parade music.
The ticket-taker was surprised. The other 56,239
people were already there. There was only one place
left to sit. Fortunately, that place was directly behind
the Pitt band. We were pleased. I had not been to a

game in many years; we would have enjoyed more of .

the traditional, unashamedly martial material in the
halftime shows. Still, it was good.

The Golden Girls were a surprise to us both. Jack
had never seen a gilded -crotch before, and I couldn’t
remember when I had either. ‘ No matter. The
cheerleaders made up for a lot. “They were just as
unnaturally wholesome as anyone could have
expected, and lively as well. Jack learned to be a real
fan—just like the guys who'used their ﬁeld. glasses
only at halftime.” He picked out a favorite
-cheerleader—the one embraced by the “tiger” (his
knowledge of the great cats is limited) and frequently

Did I hear some dunce '“

flung into the air by._one of her male colleagues.
Then the game resumed. The sun had set for those
of us on the Pitt side,_ and the air was crisp. Jack
soon learned the bad guys were wearing white
jerseys, and it was all right to leap on top of them
when they took the football. There was a gratifying
number of occasions on which the football was
punted.’ ‘ ‘ '
“Look. ‘That man »is going to kick the ball in the
air." . . 1
Very nice. But the band spent most of its time
shouting along with the cheerleaders. ' The
cheerleaders recommended something called a
“D—fence" very often. They did not mention the

“O—'fence”, which I understand is not only
important, but critical.
« .No matter.

' Mr. Anthony Dorsett-got back into his habit of
scoring yards and points at the expense of the other
fellows. It was beautiful to see him. The great
extravagances of sporting activity are as lovely and
as rare as those of ballet. Those who see them are
fortunate—and wise for having arranged to be there.

But we are doubly thankful to Dorsett and his. ‘

teammates. ‘When the ordinary business of football
is going on, the band reduces itself to a couple of
drums, playing in unison on the advice of the
‘cheerleaders. When a score is made though, all the
instruments are used. The effect is quite powerful
for field goals and stunning for touchdowns. Even
the kick after touchdown is saluted resonantly.

When we left, the score was 34-20 as- it was to
remain until the end of the contest. There were
about four minutes of playing time remaining on the
clock. It might seem ungrateful thatwe not only
came late but also left early. There is a reason.

Jack is only three feet tall, and some of our 56,000
friends might have missed seeing him altogether, or
mistaken him for a crushed and defeated enemy. So
we ﬂed.

It was fine to learn once again that sports fans are

not all of some strange species. Most people in the »

stadium were the same people who ﬁll buses and
populate English classes. -
Jack has learned something about football and a lot

' about parade music and people. I do hope though,

that if "we repeat the experiment, the Pitt team will-

_ not be so foolish as to wear white shirts.

Man from Tass Kills  
Another Stereotyper

T New Provisions

For Handicapped

As we were walking through the A

doors of the Cathedral opposite
Heinz Chapel for the xth time this
year, our adrenalin rose again.

There on the door, in beautiful

‘upper-cased white letters, was a

sign reading “HANDlCAPPED
ONLY,” whereupon we decided to

,_"/“mice our feelings instead of merely
‘ domplaining to each other.

We question the need for such
discrimination. As teachers, we
are working in order that our
students can be and feel as much a
part of society as anyone else.
Being an intellectual community,
Pitt should be one of the first to
realize this as one of their goals.
"But, with such obvious labeling,
they are further saying “You are
different.” Besides, ANYONE

knowsthat a wheelchair cannot fit

through a revolving door.

Not wanting to be unduly
sarcastic, we feel that the
University should be commended
for the provision it has made,
providing increased mobility of all
persons.

A Band ‘Tootingi

Its Own Horn’

I have been following with much
interest the letters and comments

on the University of Pittsburgh"
‘ Varsity Marching Band.

I can’t believe that the Pitt Band
would have to ask each member to
contribute $1 for an advertisement
in the Pitt News to “toot their own
horn.” A half page ad to brag

‘ about being better than Syracuse

isn't saying much, most high
school bands“ are better than
Syracuse. Iwould like to have seen
the Band at West Virginia. What a
Band—really looked great on
television, new uniforms really
showed up, two hundred some on
the field and two excellent fast,
skilled feature twirlers.

No one has really answered the
questions asked of the band.
Instead they “skirt” the real issue

by calling a person ignorant who‘

doesn’t sign their name. Pitt for
many years had an outstanding
band of 120 musicians who were
very proud. Now they have added
some 40 girls to the organization,
so why don’t .you have 160
musicians on the field instead of
90? Something is drastically wrong
and perhaps it is time for the Band
members to look into the real
reason for their problem, the Band
Director and the administration.
They are not doing their jobs. See
you at Penn State.

M. E. Elbas

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

He was quite noticeable——the
only middle-aged man in the press
area when Angela Davis spoke at
Soldiers and Sailors Hall Friday
night. His short-cropped, peppery
hair and slight paunch set him
aside from the other reporters who
were from radical New York
newspapers, radio stations and the
like. And he must have noticed my
staring at him because he quickly
jumped up to greet ‘me.

“‘Pleased to meet you. My name
is Nikolai S-.” ‘ '
I was dumbfounded, for the

press tag on his lapel read “Tass.” .

Tass is one of those seemingly
mythological entities ' that exist
solely in the columns of Associated
Press and United Press Interna-
tional press stories. As the official
Soviet news.agency, it usually is
quoted as condemning some action
by the “imperialist United States.”

But here it was—'—-that veryv
institution, represented in front of.
me by a figure whoylooked more

like my grandfather than, some; - :2’
monster from behind the Red Veil. :. i-E
My’ first question was rather‘.

stupid: “Are you from Russia?” to

which he nodded», but quickly
added that for the last four years he H
had been living in New .York.

Recovering quickly, I tried to get on
more intellectual ground and asked
him what he thought of the current
crisis in New York.

“I think it is very bad because it

affects a lot of people. But I’m‘
prejudiced because I love The.

City.” - .

You could almost hear the capital '

letters in “The City” in his voice.
It seemed strange to hear someone

speak almost reverently about the, H ,
Big Apple when less than a decade _ "

ago we were being told his

compatriots wanted to destroy, it. ._ L ‘C

Our conversation settled ‘down to

'more professional tones and I .,
asked if he (they? Tass?) was. "

interested in the speech because
Davis is a member of the
Communist party.

Tables of jewelry and minerals
gleamed under the chandeliered
light of the Student Union
Ballroom. People drifted slowly in
to the Lapidary show and sale
presented by the Student Union
Board, attracted by the brightness
and intrigued by the signs. What
does “lapidary” mean anyway?

Lapidary is the art of «cutting,
polishing and engraving semi-
precious stones. Members of the
Mineral and La'pidary societies of
Pittsburgh and the surrounding
have gathered in the
Ballroom to demonstrate their
techniques and exhibit their wares.

Viola Dorsey and her husband
James of North Versailles, Pa.,

-- often have cut stones for- the

Carnegie Museum’s gem collec-
p tion. They explained stone-polish-
ing techniques to interested specta-

One of the most basic shapes in
fashioning gemstones is a ca-
bochon (“or ‘cab’ as‘we call it”).
In its simpler form, a cabochon has
one ﬂat and one domed surface.
“A cabochon,” Viola Dorsey said,
“can be any shape, an oval, just so
it’s a dome.”

The stages of creating a
cabochon begin with sawing off the

specimen to the desired size, then

marking the shape on a pattern,
cutting the outline to the shape,
grinding it to the desired form,
sanding to remove all grooves and
scratches and ﬁnally polishing it.

Polishing gem work takes only a
few minutes if the stone has been
prepared properly.

“If we didn’t get all the
scratches out, it will show now and
we’ll have to go over it again,”
Dorsey said. In the event a
mistake is made in cutting or
grinding, the lapidary just makes a
smaller stone, she added.

The grinding, sanding and
polishing can be done on one
machine, but some prefer to do the
polishing on a separate wheel that
can be kept scrupulously clean. A
small particle of grit from the
grinding and sanding processes
can ruin the polish completely.

The last step in polishing gems is
to back-bevel the stone (cut the
back edges at an angle) so it can be
mounted. “The softer the stones,
such as feldspar and malachite, the
easier it is to work with them. They
don't need to be worked on as long
as agates or harder stones need to
be,” remarked Dorsey.

Stones don't always have deﬁ-

nite forms. Irregularly shaped
stones called baroques often are
used in laplidary work and make
interesting pieces of jewelry.

A gem stone depends as much on
its depth of color as on the manner
in which it is cut an_d polished for
its beauty, according to Dorsey.
“Most pure minerals areclear.
Unless they have impurities, they
won’t have color.”

The Dorseys sometimes search
for stones out West in the Rocky
Mountains. “But mostly we just
buy them from rock shops,” they
explained.

The Dorseys also work with
synthetic stones. ’P‘ointingAgyt a
green stone in a" display case,’
Dorsey said, “That green stone
was faceted from a Coke bottle.
It's just as good as a natural stone
and certainly not cheaper. When
forming a synthetic stone, the same
type of heat and amount of
pressure that occurs in nature is
used. As a matter of fact, synthetic
stones are ‘much purer than
naturals.”_

They havebeen collecting stones
for 20 years and Dorsey admits that
lapidary can become an expensive
hobby that takes a lot of money and

expensive equipment. “But for the.

training and enjoyment it gives,’ it’s.
worth it. lt’s a hobby for us,
something we like to do when the
wind is howling and the snow is
blowing.”

a hobby for them. But there were a
few who also consider it a business.
7 Tom and Pearl Jack of Apollo,
Pa., have worked with stones for
about four years. Pearl Jack said,
“We’ve reached the point where
we do custom work. We are
starting to work with better stones.
‘,‘It takes an hour and a half
sometimes’ to do the cheaper
stones. It gets to a point where it’s
not worth it. It's a good family
hobby. lt’s as expensive as you
want to make it.”
Lapidary clubs are numerous and

Devlin photo

provide an opportunity for mem-
bers to use equipment and to
practice new skills. There is always
someone who can teach a new
aspect of lapidary to the club
members.

Lapidary can become an. obses-
sion—carried out as a simple and

' relatively inexpensive hobby, or as

a complex art form, requiring much
devotion and expense. But its
practitioners agree it’s worth the
effort.

“No, we would be interested in
this even if she were not.”

Slowly our talk fell into an
interesting pattern. I would ask
questions, each one more pointed,
more luring than the last. But his
answers were a study in controlled
speech. Each one was couched
carefully in phrases that were sure
not to offend anyone-—me or his
superiors.

I made one last attempt to draw
him out and proffered another
question: What did he think of the
U.N. resolution on Zionism?

“We have a special correspon-
dent at the U.N. who covers these
stories.”

I gave up. It was obvious who
was the amateur and who was the’
professional. Ihad no choice but to
let our meeting degenerate into a
reenactment of the conversations of

. hundreds of Soviet-American ren-

dezvous all over the world. We
talked about detente.

“I believe that the Soviet people
are much more optimistic about
detente than Americans because
American society is so polarized,”
he said. “We need more economic
and cultural ties to draw the two
capitals together.”

So there it was. A very neat and
carefully rehearsed speech, pro-
bably given hundreds of times
before to Americans hungry to
learn that their Soviet counterparts
are not such bad guys after all. It
seemed to be the focal point of our
talk, the purpose for out even
meeting.

Nikolai went on, telling me about
his wife and children, his two-

month vacation in Russia and other

' stories he has covered. Then, as

quickly as our conversation began,
it ended. Nikolai excused himself
and went about his business of

~ snapping pictures and occasionally
jotting down notes. I had the
feeling of politely being dismissed
from an interview. "

 

 

I watched Nikolai on and off for
the rest of the evening and could

not help but wonder -what he“

thought, if anything, of our
meeting. Did I seem typically
American? Eager to prove myself
in an interview? Nikolai is pleasant
and obviously successful in his
ﬁeld. And he’s master at playing

JEAN COCTEAU’S

This remarkable film depicts the love of the poet Or-
pheus for the Princess who travels constantly between
this world and the next. Cocteau reveals a poetic fasci-
nation with the power and conflict of the real world
with the world of imagination and the unknown. As the
legend unfolds, Cocteau’s photographic mastery pulls
the audience into the fantasy of truly being in touch
with both of these worlds.

”Marvelously successful balance of the real and the magical . . .
encompasses both levels with power and fascination: its picture,
of poet's torment and obsession with the unattainable is some-
thing unique . . . the most complete and successful achievement
of Cocteau in the cinema . . . ORPHEUS extends the frontiers of
the cinema and is an inimitable, unique experience. Its impor-
tance in the future will be as great as any of the other major films

BY A‘. IRENE SCHMIDT

 The majority of people streaming
from the ‘Syria Mosque Sunday
-fjaftemoon probably would have
« “termed the preceding three hours,
“interesting.” Not inspiring or
* beautiful, but interesting.

7 :Tlie Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s
last performance -at the Syria
Mosque was quite a contrast to its
'first_ beneﬁt performance at the
height of the symphony strike.
Then. everything was harmonious
and pleasing to look at in terms of
composition, and the dancing was
incredibly enthusiastic.

Sunday’s performance was,
above everything else, uneven. The
-.:{fo’rmat—a segment of Swan Lake;
 Winterset, a turbulent ballet based
 .on,the Sacco and Vanzetti murders;
‘ Cersaire, a traditional pas de deux,
and the Dohanyi Suit-juxtaposed
pieces so different that the
‘ ‘alternating style was actually
.: jarring. ’ _

Even more difficult than weath-
’ ering the abrupt changes between
intermissions was understanding
I _the ballets. In the case of the Swan
-Lake» segment, the onstage action
p consisted more of dramatization
‘ ‘~th_an of dance. However, even the
igdramatization didn’t closely re-
semble what the bewildered
‘ audience was pouring over in the
programs. Watching this ballet left
'-one ‘with the sad impression that
.2 the Ballet Theatre had chosen a
_,  piece it simply wasn't ready for yet.

' ‘p The company's strength seems to
 lie in the individual styles of its
 soloists. The individuality of
 _Dagmar Kessler and Alexander
 '_ Filipov in Corsaire is an excellent
 _. example. However, attempting to
 integrate dance and theatre simply
 didn’t work.

._ " One trend that became notice-
 able in; Swan Lake and surfaced

. again iii the last selection, the
, Dohanyi Suite, was a misuse of the
L} costuming and general prominence
‘ of the corps deballet. The most

  
  
 

pleasing moments came when the
principal dancers—Jordeen lvanov
and Thierry Dorado in this
case-—were alone on the stage. The
appearance of the corps always
seemed like an obstruction to the
solo performances. _ A

Special commendation must go
to Pitt associate professor of
Theatre Arts Henry Heymann for
set designs. The dusky blue
mountain lake of the backdrop was
a perfect setting and imbued the
entire stage -with the twilight
feeling of a deep forest. The
lighting crew unfortunately did its
best to dispel the mood with missed
cues~and misplaced spots.

If anything emerged unscathed
from the hodgepodge of Swan
Lake, climaxing with the appear-
ance of the evil sorcerer, Baron-von
Rothbart, dressed as the spitting
image’ of the Giant Eagle Bird, it
was the dancing of Ivanov. Her
arms alone were perfect. She
managed to incorporate the tiny,
fluttering hand movements in a
truly touching manner. She alone
among the company seemed to be
totally at ease with her role and her
dance. It was unfortunate the total
effect was a swan among pigeons.

The second ballet again suffered

from a lack of comprehension by,

the audience. The program itself
was totally confusing. Coupled with

the actual ballet, it detracted from ‘

the magniﬁcent performances by
lead dancers Jo Ann McCarthy and
Gregory Begley. Still, applause on
the ﬁnal fade-out was tumultuous.

Saving graces of Winterset were

tremendous sets and the intense .

and spirited dancing of McCarthy
and Begley. As a young couple
dancing their emotions under a
bridge in Italy, they drew the
audience into the turmoil of “love
among the ruins.”

In Winterset, as in the Rothbart
costuming in Swan Lake, it seemed

as though someone had neglected '

to stand back and look at the ballet

. objectively. In neither case was the

Mom Nature's Joys

BY MREA CSORBA

‘. “Seeds, Shoots, Roots and
- ‘. Fruits” gives us an exhibition of
, natue. The show comes on with a
I ‘ lh.igh-_on-nature feeling and it's
contagious.

 

Painter Barbara Holt depicts_

harmonious contradiction in her
‘treatment of fruit. Her slices of
tomatoes,_ the_'c1itaway views of
 nuts and germinating onion heads
.‘ give us a privileged glimpse into
the intimate workings of nature.
I ‘_ Holt skillfully conveys life force
 within the 15 static representa-
tions. The contrast is beautiful and
soul-stirring. Simple complexity is
"revealed, the complete, yet forever
~‘ transforming evolutionof life.
The color of Holt’s oil paints
evokes the sense of seasons.
Spring carries joyous hues of
purples, pale yellows and greens,

‘fullness of ‘summer, glory. Fall
displays red-browns with the
beginings of subdues greys. Color
is discarded by winter for a blend of
black-browns against stark white-
ness.
Holt concentrates on the beauty
. of natural form. Whether it is the
. striking geometries" of the white
and blood-red of cabbage, or the

v: - «nyaypnwgsuwxv ~ .- -

 

   

while lively primary colors hint the .

delicate lacework of entwining
roots, she points out nature’s
profound artistic design.

She breaks away outer shells to
reveal the comfortable nestlings of
walnut meat or the cozy hiberna-

-tion of pomegranate seeds. These

are the fetuses of nature safely
-tucked away from harsh elements.

To vary the sliced-away views,
Holt superiinposes an “Apple
Core” over the faint outline of the
fruit. It is a humorous and
imaginative break from the pro-
fundityof her other paintings.
What do you have at the center of
an apple? Holt answers with a
munched apple core. _

One unwittingly becomes a
pantheist viewing her paintings.
Nature’s forgotten wisdom is
reaffirmed. All- is well with the
world, in keeping with her ways.
We feel reassured by the tender
caring she shows her tiniest living
organism and feel secure in
abandoning ourselves in her
power.

The exhibition is on view through
December 2 at the Undercroft
Gallery. A more appropriate name
would be “Under-Church,” since
the gallery is in the basement of the
First Unitarian Church at More-
wood Street and Ellsworth Avenue.

  Marx Dispels 'Zany' Myth  

BY BILL MOORE

The Marx Brothers
William Wolf
Pyramid Publications
153 pa es $1.75

 

   
   

From top to botton: Groucho,
Zeppo, Harpo. Chico and Gummo.
At first glance, , The Marx
Brothers, ‘the newest in . the
continuing Pyramid Illustrated
History of the movies series, looks
a lot like all the other books about
the Marxes that call them “zany”
and let it go atthat.

Dedicated Marxophiles know the
Brothers were quite a bit more than
just “zany,” and Wolf makes a
valiant attempt to show that.

Interestingly enough, while pre-
vious books on the. Brothers
emphasized the early problems
encountered by the Marxes, both
during childhood and during their
vaudeville adolescence, Wolf’s
book deals extensively with the
failure of the Marxes in later, years
and the conflicts between them.-

Wolf’s biggest fault is
willingness to stick-up for some of
the Marx Brothers films that
would best be forgotten. Films
such as Love Happy, despite the
Marxes, were not that funny, but
Wolf seems to much a fan to admit
it. "

He does, however, give good
thumbnail reviews of all the Marx
films, including some of Groucho’s
more obscure appearances, e.g.,
Double Dynamite (1951) A Girl.in
Every Port (1952).. V j

The photographs—and there are
quite a few of them—add to the
book considerably, helping the
reader recall key scenes in the

. films. ,

But, as said earlier, the book’s
strongest point is its concise but

thorough coverage of the _post--

fame years, point out Groucho’s
relative success and Chico’s
gambling problems.

Other books in the Pyramid.

Serieshave suffered from too little

said in too little space. The

authors, it seems, realize they have

only 150 pages, half of which are
photos, and instead of carefully
making each work count, they get
lazy and just give surface glimpses.
of much deeper personalities.

While not a major work, Wolf's
book is extremely informative
considering its shortness and
readibility, and the genius, not the
“zaniness,” of the Marx Brothers
is made clear.

“Paranoia strikes deep. Into your heart it will creep.” (Steve Stills.) V

Twelve years’ ago, on November 22, President John Fitzgerald
Kennedy was traveling down the highway, around a curve, under an
underpass, when his head was_'blown away by persons unknown. I say
persons unknown because I am one of the assassination gonzos who

“This column-l hope would look into anyand all aspects of our
generation’s growth. Music happens to be a major source of input in
that growing process. This coiumnhas its roots and branches in that
burden. The weight is heavy indeed upon these branches, at times with

distractions. Paranoia is one.

‘Kennedy’s vigor and vitality gave a lift to American politics despite
his mistakes and hidden actions (i.e. Bay of Pigs). The ‘charisma we
remember as sixth-graders was that of the’ young President. We
certainly didn’t know or possibly understand any implication of his
dealings with intelligence agencies or cold war politics of those
frightening years. But somebody. must have, right?

The numerous assassination theories that have arisen for want of a
better answer, disregarding the Warren Report, have usually pointed
to the cult of intelligence we call the CIA.‘ In fact, the most recent

The fear has gripped musicians as well as other people. In fact, the

The secret weapon apparently is
boredom. This is one of the few
books I've ever read that makes me

glad for an interruption. As for the
indolent ofﬁcers—they come across
more as idiot officers. As for sex,
that seems to consist of one Lucy

McClelland seemed to be every-
where; he scored 10 points, pulled
down 11 rebounds and had four
assists. '

If there was a question mark
concerning the Pitt squad before
the game, it was at the center
position, where McClelland and
Scott Stephens were vying for the
position. And if McClelland didn’t

dispel all doubts about his play, he

at least proved his competence at a

position for which his 6-_7 frame ill

suits him.
One sad note was the injury to

Starr. He has been having trouble '

with his knee all year and
hyperextended it last night when
he drove in for a lay-up. The senior
is expected to be out of action for at

Shrewsbury said. “But I try to

The quickness has helped him

Raymond a Bg Key to   .
Shrewsbury Pantherette Basketball    

BY PATTY TASCARELLA A

Close up, she has the wholesome
demeanor of one of the original
Campbell’s soup kids; on the court,
she’s intense athlete from the top
of her tensed 5-11 frame to the
socks slumped about her ankles in
the best Maravich tradition. '

She is Kim Raymond, a top
recruit for the Pantherette basket-
ball team last season who averaged
around 11 points per game, and a
proven key to the Pantherette

strategy for the upcoming season.

The line-up this year is young; it
contains several freshmen. Much
responsibility rests on returning
sophomores Kate Szramowski,
Debbie Jones and Raymond-

“I guess we’re supposed to be
the leaders,” Raymond said, “I

think they’re looking to us.”

Back at Poms River South High
School in New Jersey, Raymond
played four years of basketball,
three of field hockey, two of track
and one of softball. She lettered in
all of them.

“Women’s athletics out East are,  -~

developed a lot more than here,
from what l’ve seen,” she noted.

“But college ball is a‘ lot more
physical than high school. Temple
was one of the most aggressive
teams we, ever played—the girls
were just shoving us.”

Sloppy socks to the contrary,
Raymond is not a free-lance" artist
on the court. _ She plays the
defense-oriented game stressed by
Pantherette Head Coach Jean
Condo. . _ __

  Education Comes First  
For Hooper Shrewsbury

(Continued from'Page10)

“At Avalon (in the North Hills),
where I went to high school, I was
the leading scorer,” he said. “But
I have had to learn how to play
defensively since coming to Pitt.”

He learned well. Shrewsbury
credits his best game to defense.

“We were playing at North
Carolina State last year,” he
explained, “and they had this kid
named Monte Towe who everyone
raved about. I played against him
for 10 minutes and held him
scoreless.’ ’

Shrewsbury’s determination to
play major-college basketball took

a him to Pitt.

“While I had scholarship offers
to smaller schools, I came to Pitt as
a walk-on,” he said. “And the
traveling was important, too.

Major colleges ﬂy...smal1 colleges
go to games in buses.”
But basketball is not the only
reason Shrewsbury chose Pitt.
“Education comes first, athletics
second,” he said. “And Pitt’s
education leads to better jobs.”
That doesn’t mean he’s going to

slack off with his roundball-play»

ing. Especially since Pitt has a new
head coach. ' .

“Coach (Tim) Grgurich" shows
more enthusiasm than Coach
(“Buzz”) Ridl did last year,”
Shrewsbury said. “This makes it
easier to get up for agame.”

Having played for Grgurich as a
freshman, Shrewsbury is familiar
with the new coach.

“Knowing what he expects of a
player is an advantage to me,”
Shrewsbury said.’ . ‘

“She can mix it up underneath
and won’t be intimidated,” Condo

said.
‘ ‘.‘She has a lot of desire to excel
and an aggressive defensive stance
‘that challenges the offensive
player—makes them think twice if
they want to come inside on her.

“She’s much more confident this
year than last; she seems to want
the ball more this year.”

“If I had my choice,” Raymond
said, “I’d be a guard. I really like
to have good passes on the key. I
like the way (New York Knick Walt)
Frazier plays, but I do_n’t pattern
myself after anybody.”

Raymond is still very satisﬁed
with her position at forward. '

_ “I really like it ‘cause I like to
a shoot outside; I feel confident

“I’m considered a rebounder for
the team. Rebounding isn’t an
easy thing to do. Just because
you’re tall, people think it’s easy.
You have to get the position. Last
year they depended on me to
rebound; Ithink-this year it’s going
to be defense. . ' -

“I think we’re going to play a lot
more man-to-man. Man-to-man is
a lot tougher but I like it better than
the zone—it’s too easy!” .

Condo indicated the possibility of
Raymond and Jones being cited for
all-American honors, but the
thought hasn’t crossed Raymond’s
mind.

“I never thought aboutit. The
only way I think anyone from our,
team could get it is if we won 3:133
