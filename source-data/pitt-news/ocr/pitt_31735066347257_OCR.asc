 Pitt Campus Copstrike Ends

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Campus police returned to work
yesterday after the University and
representatives of the Amalgama-
ted Plant Guard Union Local 502

/49 agreed to ratify a new contract



at

Monday. .

The contract, approved 13-4 by
union members ended a two week
walkout and almost four months of
contract disputes. According to
Union Steward Ron Gall, 53 of the

union members did not appear to
vote _on the contract.

The Campus Police accepted the
University’s wage proposal of 78
cents per hour over three years,
which was a major cause of the
police walkout two weeks ago.
Before the strike, Local 502 had
requested $1.50 per hour wage
increase over the next three years,
with twelve sick days and eleven
holidays. The plan approved for the
contract offers six sick days with

Waseleski Fills Interim
pf’ Editor - In - Chief Post

The Pitt News staff elected Tom.
Waseleski interim editor-in-chief
last night to ﬁll the vacancy created
by current editor Bill Moore’s
resignation.

Waseleski, a senior CAS student
and former editorial page editor,
received 22.5 votes, defeating
current news editor Lisa Rubenstein
and op-ed editor Pete Butch by 11
and 11.5 votes respectively.

Waseleski will take office Jan. 1
and serve until March 15 when
Moore’s term of office would have
expired. As interim editor,
Waseleski said he plans to evaluate
the newspaper’s responsiveness to
it’s readers and utilize the existing
staff more fully. He also pledged to
intensify the search for new writers.

“I don't think we’ve been as
responsive to our readership as we

overlooked. Large segments of the
campus feel inadequately represen-

Waseleski said.

“Dormitory Fire Alarms

L.)

BY BARB THOMAS

Most of the ten dormitory ﬁre
alarms this month were triggered
by the newly installed smoke
detection systems according to John
Harper, Fire Chief of the 24th ﬁre
division in Oakland.

Harper and Campus Police Chief
Curt Graham reported most of the
alarms were not malicious pranks
and were not connected with the
recent Campus Police strike.

Residents of Holland Hall

:3 evacuated at 6:30 a.m. Sunday

#1.; morning and again at 7 p.m. Sunday

.,night. McCormick residents

evacuated 2:30 a.m. Saturday
morning and residents of Tower A
left their building Monday night.

Despite the increase of alarms
Harper saidthe ﬁre department is
responding as quickly to campus
alarms as to any other.

“Even though the smoke detec-
tors are inconvenient they can go off
by the smoke of a burnt cake-—-they
are necessary because ﬁres can
start from a burnt cake,” Harper
said.

Graham said the alarms may be a
threat to the safety of students
because as the alarms become more

beneﬁts of $70 per week for a
maximum of thirteen weeks with
a $10 raise over the next two weeks.

The‘Union’s strike was seriously
weakened by union members who
returned to their jobs, crossing the
pickets of their fellow officers.

’ “I found management didn’t lie
in reference to the number of men
who crossed the lines. Once I found
outthat over 20 men-were back on
duty, I thought it was ridiculous not
to go back to work,” one union
member said.

Steward Ken Andrews also
returned to work, resigning his
position as one of four men
representing the union members at
negotiations.” When I returned to
work,'I felt I shouldn’t be a steward,
but I returned because the strike
was a failure,” Andrews said.

Another major item of dispute in
the contract is a provision that
would allow the management to use

‘a polygraph test (lie detector) for

investigations on internal police
investigations. According to Police
Chief Curt Graham, the use of the

polygraph is pending a legal
explanation.

"1 have everyintention of usin
the polygraph for internal affairs
long as it it lega ,” Graham said.

The non-retroactive contract,

effective yesterday will be signed by -

union members and University
ofﬁcials this week, according to Pitt
Labor Relations Manager Tom
Cherry. ’ .

The contract also includes a
pension plan for campus police that
will involve a $20 contribution from
the officers 1 and $40 from the
University in 1977. This would
increase to $25 from the officers and
$50 from the University in 1978.

The Campus Police voted in June
to switch from Teamster represen-
tation to the Amalgamated Plant
Guard Union Local 502.

Today is the last day students, faculty and staff can receive swine ﬂu

Director of Auxiliary Services Tom Albert.

There are .no suspects yet, although students did check outthe key to
the conference room last night, Albert said. The Office of Residence Life
is conducting an investigation of the vandalism, he said-

Albert said the piano was put in the conference room last year after

having been repaired for previous vandalism.

According to Director of the

the papers presented at the
conference are of a “super ”

Cuban foreign policy is formula

_ ted from three conﬂicting tenden-

cies, U.C.L.A. Associate Professor
of Political Science Edward Gonza-
lez said, the pragmatic tendency
reﬂected by the civilian managerial
elite, the revolutionary which bears
the personal stamp of Fidel Castro
and the military mission in support
of Cuba’s foreign policy objec-
tives.

“The three conﬂicting tenden- .
cies were resolved momentarily by

the Angolan intervention,” Gonza-
lez said.

“Before intervening in a coun-
try, Cuba considers its own}
positions and risks, then decides
the credibilty of the individual
cause and what kind of support to
give,” Jose Moreno, Associate
Professor of Sociology, said.

Cuba’s non-pragmatic foreign
policy has been adapting to a
changing world, Moreno said.

Cuba’s foreign policy has follow-
ed a continuity toward intervention
for international solidarity, not for
political or economic gain, Associ-
ate Professor of Sociology at the
University of New Mexico, Nelson
Valdes said. Cuba sent. troups to
Angola to ﬁght colonization, he
said.

Although the intervention was
successful, it cost Cuba money for
increased training of military
personnel and strained internal

politics, Associate Professor of.

The Police Concede

‘tn. °-...

..,,,,W_w
big busmess wins again. The (hmpus Police conceded.
i he University of Pittsburgh took advantage of every weak link. every

.wrong move by tampus Police strike leaders to render their strike

iueiieetive. it was then only a matter of time before those who chose to

t‘ j_ j remain on strike signed a contract that dictated management's terms

A majority oi the 1/ voting, 13, decided to accept Pitt's wage Offer.
- pproxiihaieiy haii ot what the union originally proposed. ‘ _
A but me University cannot be cited as the only cause of the strike
taiitire. the impotent strike effort was destined to fail. ‘
,1,-1-i taps the organizers tried too much too soon, for a fewdays after
um 5“-mg began, a majority of the strikers were back to work.
by me time contract ratifications came around, 53 men didn’t vote

because they were back on the job.

instead oi shaking their fists toward the Cathedral of learning. strike
Ul gahizers should look in the mirror. lt was their responsibility to keep
morale high, and to keep the men on the picket lines. They had to make
sure the men prevented tuiion workers and scab labor from crossing the

illlcb. /

i he siiiceiity oi those oiiginally walking out is reflected in the terms of
the contract aeeepted—a contract that does not resemble union
iequests. those sincere would not have gone back to work until a
contract reasonably close to their proposals was drafted.

the strike is now history. the Campus Police are working under a
euilttucl Wlllcll is not close to what they wanted in the first place. One
that does not resenihie the reasons for which they struck. '

Dlglullcalllly, it is a contract that does not include a retroactive wage
iheiease. the police do not get a raise for the work they did those months

_ they were without contract.

the police-aumiiiistration, police

C 'Abor’rionMy’rhs'

Printed Garbage

I am insulted and outraged as a
woman, as a human being. with

0 even a modicum of understanding
A‘ of this world’s real problems! It is

beyond my comprehension to

understand how or why you can
allow ‘that illigical and immoral
turkey, Moynihan, to print such"

garbage as his
abortion. ,
Moynihan backs the Catholic

“myths" on

‘' Church's perverted views with the

blind enthusiasm of pep—rallyism;
but he is the fool, the puppet of that
anti-woman hierarchy. They are

. losing their vicious battle in spite of

dummies like Moynihan (and
whoever allowed his “editorial” to
be printed) because their own
weapon--immorality--has been
defined by the people.
Immorality is back alley

butchery. immorality is forcing a
woman who is unhappily, impreg-

» nated, to sacriﬁce her freedom to

that unwanted birth. Immorality is
making freedom of choice guilt-
inducing and illegal. Immorality is
a man, or a misogynist institution
making the rules of a ‘woman’s
destiny. Keep your laws off my
body!

The question is, why is the‘

Catholic Church so vehement about
abortion these last few years when
abortion has been practiced since
pre-Biblical times? The reason is
that the Church has found an
“empty baby carriage.” Since
90% of the Church's new member-
ship comes from the newborn,
they’ve discovered in the last
decade, a decrease in the
baptismals of more than 400,000
per year--and they have good
reason to suspect their female
church members of using more

‘ti-

than the also forbidden (and
infallible) contraceptives. Although
Catholics make up only 23% of this
cnuntry’s population, they obtain
30-33%-of all abortions! So much
for their righteous authoritarian-
ism.

Sequestered bureaucrats with
dollar signs for eyes, and robes and

’ scepters for cloaks and daggers,

shall not make baby machines out
of unwilling women. We do have
constitutional rights to the “pursuit
of happiness” _ (although the
wording for this right is “men", we
have been assured we were
covered, since “women" includes
”men”). And though it may be
hard for your conditioning to allow,
Moynihan, an unwanted pregnancy
can really destroy a woman's life if
she is prevented from making a
choice. A

In spite of “moralizing” and
crusading from uninvolved parties,
women have won a long and bloody
battle to make our own decision,
and it won’t be revoked! I shudder
to think of the violence that would
rise from the rage of women’s
suppression of this meager dignity
would be revoked.

But this issue is past and my
arguments (and dozens more) have
been made thousands of times
before. If we are not mindless
college students who learn morality
from the editorial page of the Pitt
News, then we know of much more
pertinent issues. Environmental
disaster is imminent, yet we
blinder ourselves, smothering our
pain and our basic human rights to
a safe and healthy planet. Our

"government and the means to

production (ie. corporate structure)
now synonomous, have gone
beserk. The world’s economy is
perilous. Morality, in its true
sense, has become fallen prey to
the propagandists of nuclear power

BY DAN MULHOLLAND

Editor’s note: This is the
conclusion of Dan Mulholland’s
column explaining his views on
abortion.

Myth #4: The pro-life movement
is a front for the Catholic Church.
This is one of the ugliest of the
pro-abortion arguments, because it
reveals a deep seated religious
bigotry, reminiscent of the Know
Nothings and the A.P.A. While it
is true that many Catholics have

_ rallied to the defense of the

unborn, they do not have a
monopoly on the issue by any
means. Many other groups,
including the Mormons, the United
Pentecostals, the the ‘Orthodox
Jews have gone on record as being
opposed to abortion. Moreover,
some of the most outspoken critics

and warfare. But instead of rising
with anger and indignation at the
stakes of the human race in a
nightmarish reality, a few of us

have sunk to triviality. _ Have
developed fetus fetishes.

Bonnie Munnell

Editor’: note: -The columnist’s
surname was Mulholland, not

Moynlhan.
Meanings Missed

While I might share Dan
Mulholland’s objections in principle
to abortion, 1 must vehemently
object to the gross distortions and
plain errors of fact in his column of
Monday, Nov. 15, purporting to
deal with “The Legal Myth of
Abortion.”

It is apparent that he has not
even read the United States
Supreme Court opinion in Roe V.
Wade, which he so freely criticizes,
and I would wager he has never
even heard of the companion case of
Doe v. Bolten decided on the same
day.

Mulholland starts off wrong in his
ﬁrst sentence, where he asserts that
after Roe, “abortion on demand
became the law of the land.” Roe
implicitly, and Doe explicitly state
“a pregnant woman does not have
an absolute constitutional right to
an abortion _ on her demand.”
Rather, the court said that during
the first three months of pregnancy,
“the abortion decision and its
effectuation must be left to the
medical judgment of the pregnant
woman's attending physician.’ ’
Mulholland’s second major point,
that the court “simply reached the
conclusion that the fetus is not a
legal person, ” also is without basis.

     

Abortion:

of the assault on life are
non-Catholics such as Dr. Mildred
Jefferson, president of the National
Right to Life Committee, John
Lofton, the nationally syndicated
news columnist, and Justices
Byron White and William
-Rehnquist who have consistently
dissented from the death-dealing
opinions of their colleagues on the
high court.

Myth #5: Abortion is the best
solution to an unwanted
pregnancy. On the contrary, it is
by far the worst. Experts have
repeatedly ‘documented that after

, an abortion, a woman is subject to

profound physical and psycho-‘
logical distress. Future miscar-
riages and other complications are
the rule rather than the exception.

In addition, with the increasing

Draws Response

The court instead argues that a
fetus’ legal rights do not override
those of the mother until the fetus is
viable in the womb, since presum-
ably at that point the baby could
survive on its own outside of the
womb. For that reason the court
said that a state may" prohibit
abortioggqiftetiruviability since it has
an interest in protecting the legal
rights of that child‘.  *— A  

The ﬁnal ‘ ‘myth’ ’~ that V Mulholl-
and attempts to expose is that
“legalized abortions will do away
with the ‘back alley b'utchers’."
May I point out that in most, if not
all, states, abortions performed by
non-physicians are illegal regard-
less of atwhat stage of pregnancy
they are -performed. Roe and Doe
and several cases following them
have affirmed that , a state may
prohibit abortions by non-physic-C
ians. I don’t know where
Mulholland gets his statistics from
which he can make the broad .(and
entirely unsupported) statement
that “the number of backroom
abortions has actually increased.”
But if that is true, Mulholland’s
gripe is not with the Supreme Court
ruling, which have actually increas-
ed the power of the states to protect
the health of the mothers by
requiring medical advice and
setting medical standards for
abortions, but with law enforcement
agencies which fail to detect and
prevent the, “back-room” abor-
tions.

There are many good, rational
objections to the distinctions laid
down by the court in Roe and Doe,
but Mulholland has missed all of
them. His wild, misinformed and
irrational column is quite a setback
to the pro-life movement.

accuracy of pre-natal testing, more
abortions are being sought simply
because the baby is the wrong sex.
The only solution to “unwanted
pregnancies” which is morally
acceptable is adoption, not abor-
tion. This would yield an added
beneﬁt of destroying the “black
market baby” trade

.Myth #6: Abortion is necessary
to combat the population explosion.
This most callous of arguments is
based on the fallacious premise
that there actually is a “population

' ,9
exp1°S‘°n ‘ Recent studies.

such as the one conducted by
Ansley Cole, the director of the
Office of Population Research at
Princeton, have shown that the
population rise in this country has
all but stopped, and that in 21 of
the 31 most developed nations, the
birthrate -has fallen below the
replacement rate.
population “bomb” has fizzled. If
the entire population of the world
at the present time could be put
inside the state of Texas, every
man, woman, and child would have
about 2000 square feet of living
space, (the average American

, home contains between 1400-1700

sq. ft.) and the population density
would only be one-half that of San
Francisco. Food.is not a problem
either, since agricultural produc-
tion is currently increasing 10%

— faster than population, according to

ﬁgures compiled by the Population
Council. There is plenty of room
for growth, and by the same token,
a decrease in our population would
have a devasting effect on the
economy. So why is the
government pursuing a policy
which actively encourages abor-
tion? Simple: population control
means people control, the goal of
all unscrupulous and evil men who
crave power.
Despite all of this, there are still
some pro-lifers who are willing to
accept the recent Supreme Court
rulings, either out of blind
deference to the judiciary, or
adherence to the false hope that
some attempts at restricting
abortions will succeed These
individuals would do well to listen
to Justice Stevens’ opinion in
Planned Parenthood V. Danforth
which correctly identiﬁed abortion
on demand as “the law of the
"land.”" Clearly, the only solution
left is to seek a constitutional
amendment insuring the right to
life of all citizens, born and unborn.
There is no middle ground, no
room for equivocation on this issue.
The Supreme‘ Court must be
reversed, and it must be done soon.
To acquiesce with their decisions
would be an affront to that most
basic mandate of our Constitution
as set forth in the Preamble: “To
insure the blessings of liberty for
ourselves, and our posterity."

Lapidary--A Different Way To Get Stoned

BY BETSY NORMAN
Flat spots, shaping, polishing,
325 mesh, 600 mesh, diamond
compound, 8,000 mesh, 100,000

' mesh... What do all of these things

mean? They , are all terms
describing the art of lapidary.
“A person who cuts, shapes and
polishes gem stones is a lapidary,
‘and that is also the name of the
“art,” Jim Dorsey, chairman of the
Lapidary Show and Sale now being
held in the SU Ballroom said. The
show and sale is co-sponsored by
the Mineral and Lapidary Society of

"aPittsburgh and the Student Union

Committee on the Arts;

What is it like to shape and
polish gem stones? I was
wondering the same thing, so
Dorsey offered to let me try my
hand at it. He handed me a round
wooden stick, about 3 inches long
with a rock stuck on the end with
some kind of putty. The stick was
called a ”dop stick” and the rock
was a piece of sodalite, a blue
gemstone.

9 I was introduced to a grinding,

G

buffing and polishing machine by
Bob Thompson, a demonstrator for
the society.

He explained (the shaping
technique) and showed me how to
do it. Holding the dop stick in my
right hand, I shaped the sodalite by
pressing it against a rapidly
turning wheel covered with sand-
paper.

As parts of the stone were
ground away, Thompson told me to

? ‘Creep turning the gem stone so that

it would be shaped evenly. I
eventually shaped the sodalite into
an oval, and then rounded off the
top like it was a dome. This
resulting style is called a cabochon.
I was a little skeptical at ﬁrst,
fearing that one slip could ruin the
stone and/ or my finger. But I tried
it. .
I did the rough shaping of the
stone, with Thompson adding a few
touches here and there. Then I put

another wheel on the grinding

machine for the ﬁnish grinding, in
which a ﬁne grain of sandpaper
was used. _

On this wheel, the lapidary

- insures that there are no ﬂat spots

on the stone, or pits caused by gas

_during the formation of the stone.

Rounding off the stone was also
finished on this wheel.
After grinding came the polish-

 

ing. This again was done on still

another wheel, or rather disc.

These discs were on the right end
of the machine and when you
ﬁnished with one, it was removed
and another one was put on. I
started out with a low mesh, in this
case 325 mesh. This means on the

. disc, in every square inch, there

are 325 wires. A diamond
compound, a liquid with ﬁne
diamond crystals in it, was applied
to the discs. These diamond
crystals actually polish the stone.
The more diamond crystals in a
square inch, the smoother the
polish.

So I polished the stone on the 325

mesh disc, and then moved up to :~

600 mesh, 8,000 mesh, and
ultimately 100,000 mesh. I ended
up with a beautifully polished royal

‘blue stone.

I decided that the stone had to be
set, so Henry F. Hile, president of
the society, offered to set if for me '
in a silver ring setting. The setting

, cost me $8.

Dorsey explained more about
lapidary saying, “It is a progres-
sive hobby. You can go into this
hobby for as little as $20 and make

“My family and I have been
collecting stones since 1958. We
didn't start polishing until 1968. I
do it only as a hobby. We collect
raw stones on various ﬁeld trips.”
Dorsey said. “We go to different
shows and shops and, buy material
from them. We’ve done a lot of
ﬁeld collecting in this country,
none abroad though. We have club
members who go around the world
collecting.”

The Pitt Show is one of the two
shows held annually by the society,
which is a non-profit organization.
Their other show is at Christmas at
Buhl’ Planetarium and is strictly
non-commercial, according to
Dorsey.

“We like to do this show to
introduce people, especially
students, to the art. We like to

‘encourage them into taking up this

hobby, as it can be relaxing and
enjoyable for many years to come, ”
Dorsey said.

The show continues today until 6-

“Students themselves could be

Coming to Civic Arena

Acrobats Touring, Amazing

BY MREA CSORBA

The full force of their
pageantry and dazzle won’t arrive
in Pittsburgh until Dec. 14, but two
of the 65 member Chinese Acrobats
of Taiwan troupe that previewed
that show in solo performances in

the Hilton Hotel lobby Monday’

gave proof of considerable skill.
Even minus the. show-cased
atmosphere that the Civic Arena
ﬂoor stage will provide the world
renowned entourage—Mei-Hau
Chang, the teacup lady, and
Te-Lung Chang, the levitation
'wizard—were amazing.
Mei-Hau, dressed in white
pantaloons, with a loose, decorated
‘top easily uggled hoops and balls in
her hand and in her mouth before
the press corps in« the hotel lobby.
That was nice. But the act that put
her over ordinary acrobats was the
stacking of ﬁve sets of teacups and
saucers on her head by tossing
them up there with an easy kick of
her foot. -
Te-Lung followed with his own
‘tour de force.’ Concentrating
deeply on a 10 pound glass jar
{filled with beans to give the

weight), he levitated the piece with ,

several different hand placements.

For his next feat, Te-Lung chose
Pitt News photographer Jim
Metcalfe and myself to aid him in
breaking a hard bamboo pole that
hung suspended through two loops

_ of newspaper strips.

t_he trick was to snap the pole
with another bamboo stick without
tearing the farail newspaper strips.
To complicate it, Te-Lung asked us
to hold the loops by the edge of
sharp knife blades. True to his
‘fame, the loops did not tear,
though the bamboo stick snapped
into two and bounced across the
ﬂoor from the force of his swift
blow.
No longer as dubious about his
claims, Metcalfe and I allowed

 

Te-Lung to suspend another pole
between our heads——a pole which
he promised to also chop in half,
without displacing a strand of hair
on either of our heads.

Once again the bamboo snapped,
leaped in two pieces across the
floor, hitting a shot-snapping
camera person on the leg, and all 
felt was a tiny sensation, as if being
lightly pricked by a pin on my head.

 

Through the translation of Lew,
Coach Yen-Ming said that Budd-
hist meditation is used prior to
many difficult feats. “I used to
meditate two hours daily, when I

performed,” Yen-Ming said. “The '

troupe member who does acrobats
on a pagoda built-up of chairs,
prays to Buddha before every
performance for safety. At many

places that we perform, we set up a «

 
   

Acrobat Te-Lung Chang, practicing non-violent Kung-Fu on

photographer Jim Metcalfe and reporter Mrea Csorba. Chang chopped
a hard bamboo pole in half as it was resting on their heads, without

displacing a strand of their-hair.

The troupe is famous for
incredible feats. They are
presently travelling through-out
the United States on a three month
tour of major cities. The two
acrobats here Monday had split
from the rest of their entourage in
North Carolina on an off day to
introduce their performance to
Pittsburgh. They were accompan-
ied by Coach Yen-Ming Chang, an
ex-acrobat himself and father of
Mei-Hau, along with their touring
interpreter, Chinese-American An-
thony Lew.

make-shift altar to bow down
before a show.”

Still, Yen-Ming admitted that the
religious rituals that for ages have
been deeply entwined in the study
of acrobats are not necessarily an
integral ingredient of the perfor-
mance of an exercise. He said that
some younger students of the
Kung-Fu like art of acrobatics now
bypass religious meditation, and
learn only to concentrate on
theirpurpose with full-mind
strength.

were last year, her audience this
year was very enthusiastic about
her performance.

Unfortunately the crowd's en-
thusiasm waned as the evening
progressed.

The Freddie Hubbard group’s'
starter song fit in with the mood set
by Carns, but for his second piece,
Hubbard stepped aside to give his
back-up a freer hand, which the
keyboard player used well. But the
crowd failed to come alive.

The third piece apparantly was
intended to correct the ennui of the
crowd. Hubbard took the lead and
dominated the piece to bring the
crowd back into focus. Hubbard
introduced his group before the
fourth song and took time to
admonish the crowd for not

relaxing and settling into the
music.

It was not that the quality of his
music was suffering. With the
variety presented, the evening, on
the whole, was satisfying in its
predominately up-tempo jazz/rock
by the ﬁrst group and a more pure
form of contemporary Jazz by
Hubbard's group.

The quality was up to professi-
onal standards in every aspect of
performance. It was enthusiasm on
the receiving end that stalemated
the show. Hubbard asked the
audience what could be the
problem. Was the music putting
them to sleep? Couldn’t they get
into listening to one of the
‘baddest’ trumpets in the country?

Maybe some were insulted by
being put on the spot like that. But
it was Hubbard’s right to be. Any
top-rated group would be
disturbed to see a crowd growing
sparse,‘ and those remaining
growing laxed. It wasn't Hubbard
that failed the audience. The
concert failed in audience re-
sponse.

"John Brown's Body”
S Reading In Russian

BY MREA CSORBA

The occasion is the 113th
‘anniversary of the Gettysburg
Address. Behind the occasion is

_the opportunity to feature Pitt
Professor and Russian poet, Ivan
Elagin and his Russian translation
of Stephen Vincent Benet’s epic
poem, “John Brown’s Body.”

Friday, 7:30 p.m. in the Frick
Fine Arts auditorium, Elagin will
team up with English Professor
Chris Rawson in a back-to-back
reading of passages, in the
translated and original form.

Why _a Russian translation of a
black/white rooted conflict that
Russia cannot easily relate to.
Because Elagin is fascinated with
the epic form. But more so because
Elagin admires the way the 12
thousand line poem deals with the
Civil War conﬂict between North
and South—taking no sides,
labeling none bitterly. He
translated the epic poem into his
native language in hopes of

The ‘Other’, Airplanes Take-Off Slow

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Hoppkorv-Hot Tuna
Grunt - BFLI-19820

In the last two years Paul
Kantner, Grace Slick and Marty
Balin have been ﬂying high with the
Jefferson Starship. But whatever
happened to the other members of
the acid-protest group of the 60’s,
the Jefferson Airplane?
particular what are former Airplane
members Jorma Kaukonen and
lack Casady doing now?

To fill you in. these two have been
-terforming in a little San Francisco
ower trio called Hot Tuna since
971. They have released a number
rt‘ tasty, but non—commcrcial
A‘ bums. their music confined to a
nail. loyal college cult.

Hot Tuna has needed a break for a
ing time. Their music is too good
} be ignored. The band’s new

And in,

album, Hoppkorv, might be the
vehicle to much deserved acclaim.
It’s a fine collection of old rock
standards and _original composi-
tions by lead guitarist and vocalist
Kaukonen. The titles remain
strange, (like in their past albums),
but the music contained in
Hoppkorv is much more commercial
than the hard rock found on Yellow
Fever and America’s Choice.

Side A opens up with a nasty
“Santa Claus Retreat.” Kaukonen
proves from the start that he is one
of the true killer lead guitarists in
rock. His mufﬂed and distorted
chords set the muddy mood, with
periodical finely-structured, slash-
ing chords viciously punctuating
this surly rocker.

Hot Tuna has aco,uire<.l a sort of
backpackiiig--doper image. which
may or may not be justified.
However Kaukonen can write some
extremely tender ballads. “Watch
the North Wind Rise" and “Talkin

About You” are crystal clear
ballads which evoke mellow love
messages in a simple way.

Casady and Kaukonen have
never been musicians caught up in
abusing the studio; throwing in
unneeded intricacies and lushness
just for the sake of complexity. Hot
Tuna sticks to basics: guitar, bass
and drums, and they have perfected
this uncluttered context.

The two ballads aside, most of the
songs on Hoppkorv are ballsy hot
rockers similar to “Santa Claus
Retreat." “It’s So Easy,” a remake
of an old Buddy Holley hit, would do
wonders to rejuvenate mundane
AM rockers. It is nasty, yet it
bubbles with clean guitar licks and
tightly woven bass lines.

llxtrittatioii l._.':we Song,” “Bow-
legged Womzm. Knock lineed
Man." and "Song From the
Stainless Cymbal," continue in this
rough it‘ ready vein. The whole
band delivers with gusto, booming

 

full Hot Tuna sound out of the
speakers.

People have had trouble under-
standing Hot Tuna. Since
Kaukonen and Casady left the
Jefferson Airplane in l97l. they
have kept an cxtrcinely low profile.
But if they keep _;iroducing music
similar to the high quality of
Hopplcorv. the public may demand
that they move back into rock's
spotlight. i

showing Russians the solution out
of the hatred that still prevails
between the White and Red sides
of Russianfs own civil war 50 years
ago.

“To this day, the Whites and
Reds are mortal enemies, never
having put their past differences
aside,” Elagin says. “Modern
Russian writers dealing with that
period still draw the line between
the good guys in the white hats and
the bad guys in “black.”

Being an immigrant who left
Russia in 1950, Elagin cannot seek
Russian printers to publish his
translation. But American presses
working with the cultural exchange
program between the two countries
have printed sections of his text in
circulations distributed in Russia.
“Though I’m personal non grata to
the Russian government,” Elagin
observed, “they have not blocked
those circulations.”

The Slavic Department profes-
sor, whom his co-reader Rawsons
calls the third most important
Russian poet living in America,
spent ﬁve years on his translation,
first working out a literal word-by
-word translation with his lan-
guage-skilled daughter. Then
Elagin overhauled that version with
what he calls an artistic translation.

“lt’s ideal to be able to translate
a poem line by line, but the Russian
translation is inevitably always
longer. Eight _ lines in English
comes to nine lines in Russian,”
Elagin explained, but said that he
kept “parallel structure with the
original, and rhyming all the couple
of thousand lines in Russian that
Benet rhymed in his work.

Because of the language differ-
ence, the reading of the matching
passages between Elagin and
Rawson will sound different.
Elagin illustrated by pointing out
that the short, one syllable word
‘dog’ in English. translates into a
quite rythmical three syllable
Russian word. But besides the
inevitable difference in rhythm of
the lines, the two readers.‘ speaking

styic will add their own distinct
ilav<>i‘ to the passages. Elagin
speaks in the purely ‘(>l'll(,‘t‘

t:mitinv;:i1t' eloquent jgush of emoti-
on. while liavt-soil inaintains 3
much more sober, lucid manner of
reciting.

It reports from Pitt Stadium are true. Coach Johnny Majors will be
,. pointing the way to Louisiana as he leads his number-one ranked

Panthers into the Sugar Bowl against Georgia on New Year’s Day.

BY STEVE SYBERT

Pick a bowl, any bowl.

That seems to be the situation for
the number-one ranked Pitt Pan-
thers, who are currently in the lofty
position of choosing where they

‘would like to spend New Years Day
aside from the off-limits territory
surrounding Pasadena, Calif., and

, the Rose Bowl, which is committed

to the champions of the Pacific
Eight and the Big Ten conferences.

The three remaining major
bowls—Orange, Sugar and Cotton
—have been showing open arms to
Tony Dorsett and crew all season.
But so many rumors and “ifs” have
been ﬂoating around to make the
bid the Panthers will accept a
toss-up. Bids can be extended
ofﬁcially this Saturday at 6 p.m.

Talk out of the Pitt administra-
tion, athletic department and squad
has pretty well eliminated the
Panthers as an opponent «for the
winner of the Southwest Conference
in the Cotton Bowl (see other story,
this page), so now the Panthers’
sweet tooth will be deciding on
Orange or Sugar, with 50-50 odds on
each bowl.

Reports have Pitt Chancellor
Wesley Posvar and his administra-
tion opting for New Orleans and the
Sugar Bowl, to be held in the
fabulous Superdome, while Head
Coach Johnny Majors and his

Wilson photo
coaching staff were said to have
picked the Orange Bowl in Miami.

Money-wise, the Orange Bowl
would be the best choice for the
Panthers. Pitt could earn nearly one
million dollars for opting to play the
champion of the Big Eight
Conference, but would be doing
nothing to enhance its chances of
winning the school’s first national
title since 1937.

Players Vote Sugar

Senior and starting. players on
the Pitt squad have reportedly
voted‘ overwhelmingly in favor of
accepting a bid to the Sugar Bowl

A ‘to face sixth-ranked Georgia after a

40-minute meeting last evening at
Pitt Stadium, according to several
players.

A spokesman for Coach Johnny
Majors said getting Pitt its best
shot for the national title was kept
in mind and that Majors could have
more comments on the decision at
the weekly media luncheon today at
noon.

Currently, the Big Eight is
knotted in a five-way tie of teams
with 4-2 conference records.
Though all teams are nationally
ranked (AP)—Oklahoma (7-2-1,
tenth); Nebraska (7-2-1, 12th), Iowa
State (8-2, 14th), Colorado (7-3,
15th) and Oklahoma State (6-3,

  anther ors Play

F'——'-.—'_-11"ﬁ

M’-"ii

i16th)——none could provide a record
comparable to that of Sugar
Bowl-bound Georgia (9-1, sixth),
which should slip by their ﬁnal
opponent of the regular season,
Georgia Tech, and set up a
matching of 10-1 and 11-0 records if
Pitt beats Penn State.

Confusing? Wait. If the Big
Eight deadlock is not resolved and a
clear-cut winner found, it will be up
to the Orange Bowl Committee to
select the conference's representa-
tive by a complicated formula which
is bound to leave at least one or
several teams fuming, not only

because they’d be reduced to a_

lessor bowl, but would miss out on
those coveted dollar signs for their
athletic programs.

The appearance of Pitt, however,
in the Sugar Bowl, worth “only”
$750,000 to each team, would put
the Panthers into the closest thing
to a national title game, with
Georgia as their opponent. Reports
arising on Monday from the
University had the Panthers more
than interested in the Sugar Bowl,
but no one cared to comment on any
decision.

Figuring in a Pitt decision in favor
of the Sugar Bowl also has to be the
fact that ABC will be telecasting the
game——the same, ABC’ which
telecasts regular season collegiate
football and also, the same ABC
which has already televised two
Panther games this season and is
getting ready for a third Nov. 26 at
Three Rivers Stadium.

One of the many rumors has ABC
offering to televise two Pitt games
again next season—most likely
Notre Dame and Penn State—in an
attempt to lure the Panthers to
New Orleans.

If you think the situation is all
mixed up, then you are so right.
And even if Majors knows, well, he
isn't saying. ' Refusing to talk
speciﬁcally about the bowls all
season long, Majors gave in a little
by at least telling reporters after the
Panthers win over West Virginia

Icers Ear-n Tie, 8-8

BY JIMPANE

A Pitt Hockey Club “bristled
their ears” and overcame a
four-goal deﬁcit to salvage a 8-8 tie
with Penn State Sunday night in
State College, Pa.

A last minute goal by Captain
Rick Vernon gave Pitt the well
deserved tie in a game the Panthers
trailed throughout.

“We could have won the game,

6-2," Head Coach Len Barcalow
claimed after the contest, “but due
to unforseen conditions we fell
behind 4-0, then 7-4. But the guys
bristled their ears and pulled it
together for an 8-8 tie.”
. Penalties plagued both teams in
the first period, but only the Nittany
Lions could capitalize on their
power play opportunities to score
two of their four goals while Pitt
played short-handed.

Penn State's strong defensive
showing in the first period was
turned around in the second, as the
Panther defenders allowed only
nine shots on goalie Larry Newill.

One problem, though——three of
those shots crossed the goal line,
two on the power play.

Pitt did some scoring of their own
in the period as Curt Hetz, last
year’s leading scorer, started things
with eight minutes gone. Scott
Kimmick, Bill Gedeon, and Tom
Sherwin added solo tallies to leave
the Panthers three goals back (7-4)
at the second intermission.

Hetz sparked things again in the
third period by slamming home his
fourth goal of the year at 00:53 on
assists by Gary Fries and Bob
Arturo. Center Larry Gallick came
right back to pull Pitt to within one,
but Penn State added their only goal
of the period to retain a two-goal
cushion. Midway through the
period, Gallick again pulled his
team within one goal and set the
stage for Vernon’s heroics.

On a power play opportunity with
1:07 left in the game, Vernon took a
pass from defenseman Russ Stump,
who spent 14 minutes of the game in

.the penalty box, and knocked in his

third goal of the campaign.
Barcalor praised his team on their
comeback, but he still voiced his
disappointment at their shabby first
period. “We’ve got to pull up our
bootstraps next practice,” he said,
“and we'll make some changes. I
think we have a good team and
we’re going to have a good season. ’ ’
Pitt will take their 1-0-1 record to
the Civic Arena on Saturday (Nov.
20) to meet Cleveland State
University in a 1:30 p.m. game.

that the players are on, but I want
the administration to handle the
technicalities involved.”

And the players, what is their role
in the decision-making process?

“They will certainly have a large
say so in it,” Majors affirmed.
“l’ll give them my opinions and
I’m going to give them the options
quite likely and get their readings.
I don’t intend to be dogmatic about
it. They've come too far in four
years and done too much for the

...»-program and the coaching staff.

“I think they’re a reasonable
bunch of people who will listen to
me and I want to put some of the
responsibility on their shoulders."

Majors briefed his players in a
locker room meeting last evening at
Pitt Stadium, but any resolution the
Panthers may have come up with
will not be announced until
Saturday, according to a player.

“It’s a nice decision you have to
make, but when you have the
option, it’s not pleasant to turn
down a good opportunity,” Majors

said Saturday. . ‘‘I’m going to talk‘

about the possibilities of where we
should go. We'd like to have an idea
of the teams we'd be playing—the
remaining teams and the possibili-
ties for a bowl—and see what kind
of record they can come up with, see
what the odds are that they can win
the last game remaining.”

Asked if Majors would prefer~to
take on a team which the Panthers
had a greater chance of beating and

come away undefeated, the coach

said only, “That certainly can be a
big factor. I would still not go that
way against the wishes of the
squad.”

What the Panthers need to guard
against is setting up a Rose Bowl
confrontation (the represaiuratives
from the Pac-8 and the Big Ten will
be decided in this weekend’s

Who’s Afraid-Pitt-.,0r
The Junkyard Dogs?

BY STEVE SYBERT
SportsEditor ‘-
“WHO’S AFRAID OF THE PITT PANTHERS? THE GEORGIA
BULLDOGS—-THAT'S WHO? [PAID FOR BY THE UNIVERSITY OF
PITTSBURGH COMMITTEE. FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHEAP

TALK IN THE SOUTH].

No, that advertisement hasn't appeared in any southern newspapers
yet, but give it time and I'm sure someone with a little initiative and a fat
wallet to pay for costly space will pollute the Georgia newspapers with
such propaganda as what appearson page 15 of today's Pitt News.

You've got to give the University of Georgia Alumni Committee for
the Prevention of Cheap National Titles credit, however, even if they are
crying over the milk before it’s spilt. Of course,they realize that in order
for them to have a chance at being number one this season, they have to
play the number one team-—-as one Georgia Bulldog looked up from his .
dish of Gravy Train and barked off the tip of his hand. No one ever said

that Gravy ‘Train was brain food.

But if last night's reports from a meeting of the Pitt players is correct
and the Panthers have opted to face the Junkyard Dogs, winners of the
Southeastern Conference and, therefore, automatic contestants in the
Sugar Bowl, Georgia's wish will have come true-—the chance of playing

the number one team, that is.

Their wanting to play the Panthers is understood, but the Bulldogs
tactic of crying “CHEAP” at the team which beat them 19-7 last season

is, well, for the dogs.

Looking at the combined records of this season's opponents of both
Georgia and Pitt, we see that the Bulldogs have played a schedule which
has amassed a 52-52-3 log so far. Opponents of Pitt, on the other hand,
are currently at 47-56-2 going into this weekend’s games. A difference
of only five games in the win column and four in the loss column is not
what I'd call drastic enough to merit any sort of allegations from the

Bulldogs.

Also. Georgia should remember that they are the one with the loss,
not Pitt. and it came at the hands of Mississippi (21-17), who currently

holds a 5-5 record.

Who’s afraid of the Pitt Panthers? The Junkyard Dogs had better be
or they've got a surprise coming if they think a roaring Panther can be

_ tamed with just a little cheap talk.

and All-American Rande Stottle-
myer—and unfortunately, both are
in the same weight class (134 lbs.),
which means only one can wrestle in
a match.

Otherwise,, Craig Phillips (142),
Skip Bolin (167), Don Ardnt (177),
Bill Bailey (190), and Mark
Stepanovich (heavyweight), are the
only familiar faces from last
season’s starting lineup.

But Adams is still optimistic. This
year’s squad has more of one
important ingredient—enthusiasm.

“We have one of the youngest“

and .most enthusiastic teams I’ve
seen,” he said ﬁrmly. “They have a
good attitude—a real good attitude.
These freshmen are the type of guys
we’re looking for. I think it’s going
to work out pretty well.”

That enthusiasm will’ make for

. some interesting, battles over the

season, as there are currently four
weight classes that could very well
be represented by a freshman

grappler in Saturday’s opener at 3 ‘

Akron. Two of those classes, 188
lbs. and 126 lbs., have only

-freshmen signed up.‘

“There will be battles all year for
position,” Adams conﬁrmed. “The

7 guys aren’t going to be able to sit

back and relax. That should make
us a good team.”

However, injuries have delayed
the conditioning schedule Adams
had hoped to enforce, the ‘same
schedule that Adams used in
getting his squad in the superior
shape last year’s Pitt team prided
itself in.

“There’s been a lot of small
injuries?’ he said. “Nothing
serious, just a lot of injuries that
have been bugging us. We haven't
progressed as well as we wanted.”

Which is bad news, considering
the schedule. League rivals Penn
State, Clarion, and Lock Haven are
back again, plus such ranked foes as

vMaryland, Lycoming, Lehigh,

Navy and Michigan will give the
Panthers a lot to worry about.

But it is no time for alarm; as a
matter of fact, don’t be surprised if
Pitt performs impressively enough
to equal last year’s super team.

Assistant Coach George Bryant
won’t be.

“We’re getting better and better
every year that I’ve been here,”
Bryant stated.

So move over, gang, and make
room. The Pitt wrestling team is
muscling it’s way into the act, too.

Spikers Hope To A ns wer Questions

BY JOHN FINN
Do you have a chance? Can you
really beat Edinboro? Do you have a
good shot at making nationals?
Pitt volleyball coach Mike Hebert
has been besieged with questions
like these since the Pantherettes
accepted an invitation to the
Eastern Regionals this weekend at
Edinboro.
An optimist, Hebert has answer-

Pitt volleyball coaches Mike Hebert and Rich Schall have been

round-robin play. Each of the 16
teams will be assigned to one of four
brackets with four teams in each
bracket. _

Pitt has Southern Connecticut,
Slippery Rock and William Patter-
son College in their bracket, the
second, tenth and fourteenth seeds
respectively.

The Pantherettes are not com-
pletely healthy for this’ weekend.

comparing notes all week in an effort to lead the Pantherettes to a first or
second place finish in Eastern Regionals and a subsequent trip to

Nationals. _
ed all the skeptic’s questions
affirmatively so far.

A “Of course we have a chance to
go to Nationals,” he said.

And as far as top-seeded
Edinboro is concerned, Hebert
replied, “They have a fine team,
but they don’t scare us a bit.” In
other words, Hebert meant that in
Pitt, the Scots may meet their
Waterloo.

Pitt is seeded sixth in the
tournament behind Edinboro, Sou-
thern Connecticut,_ Delaware,
Brockport and Temple. The
Pantherettes have been defeated
by Edinboro and Southern Connec-
ticut earlier this season but
they crushed Delaware in two
previous outings.

Shooters Shaved,
Trim Duquesne

It was a shave-and-haircut night
last Friday ‘at Trees Hall Riﬂe
range as the undefeated Indiana
University (Pa.) Indians scalped
the Pitt riﬂe team, 1314 to 1301.

But the Panthers came back to I

lather Duquesne, 1301 to 1239.

In the triangular match, Pitt was
led by junior Lloyd Sayman with
270, followed by Mike Heck (268),
Lenet Klemencic (260), Rob Yankes
(257) and Steve Sisak (246).

The outcome puts the Panthers
in second place in the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Riﬂe
League.

Pitt has not '

Super-sub Sue Hershelman is still
recovering from a severely sprained
ankle. Diane Zaken is suffering
from a hyper-extended elbow, and
freshman standout Andy Pletz still
has a sore back.

This is the one we’ve been
waiting for,” said Hebert. “I think
our kids will rise to the occasion
despite the injuries as they’ve done
all year.”

Hebert took time to reﬂect on the
season and admitted his over-
whelming satisfaction. He also
credited his assistant coach, Rich
Schall, for much of the team’s
success. ‘ .

No matter what happens this
weekend, the Pantherettes are
young and have a very bright
future. But as far as Hebert is

concerned, the future is now, and
his first priority is going to
Nationals this year. .

PITT NOTES: This will probably
be the closest that Eastern
Regionals will be for quite some
time, and Hebert as well as his team

said they would appreciate ‘an?
support from Pitt students, espett.
ially because they will probably fac-
Edinboroon their home court. .‘;."-4,

finest women’s volleyball in the
