* The Crumbling Society

The glory that was Rome lapsed into the despair of internal
disunity. In those times, power was wrought by the sword, and
the transition of power was carried out through violent means.
Violence, in the waning days of the great Roman Civilization,
was the vogue.

Today, the glory that is the “Great Society” is crumbling
from the hailstorm of violence that clutches America in a vice-
like hold. America is a society founded on the hard core basis
of violent revolution. With the passage of time, however, this
frontier spirit has never left this nation.

There is a belief today, it seems, that-violence is the solu-
tion to America’s problems. Now, there is a new political pro-
cess whereby dissent is snuffed out by the whiz of a bullet, the
cut of a knife, or the schrapnel of an exploding bomb. And like
Rome, the transition of power and ideas is through the idiom of
violence. ‘

The waning years of the Roman Empire, according to his-
torians, were plagued by the terminal disease known as societal
deterioration. A political system that was once a codified and
administrative masterpiece withered away like a decaying
corpse.

Today the flesh of the American political and societal sys-
tems is withering away and at the bone we find decaying
marrow. The great representative democracy may not be so
great for it permits the wanton violence that took the life of
Martin Luther King, Jr. This same spurt of overt and hostile
hatred has now snuffed out the life of Robert Kennedy—a man
who wanted to bridge the gap that is now separating and
deteriorating our “Great Society.”

Even though Senator Kennedy’s assailant is not an Ameri-
can citizen, the crime is ours to bear. Society is at fault in this
tragic incident. And a society that is plagued by the sickness of
violence is doomed to the same fate that befell the Roman
Empire. '

After two despicable shootings in the short span of two
months and after the terrible assassination five years ago, how
can the American people live with themselves? Is the fate of
every great man to be at the receiving end of an assassins bul-
let? Can every American spokesman advocating change expect
to become a martyr? Has assassination, death, martyrdom, and
destruction become the premium of this “Great Society”?

The events of the past two months only preclude a very
gloomy conclusion—a conclusion that describes the beginning of
the end. And the wheels of that regressive change are already
rolling down the rocky road of destruction.

This great society of ours is now facing its greatest chal-
lenge. We face the challenge of the racial strife in the cities;
we face hunger in the country. And we are still fighting a
senseless war in Vietnam that is draining our econimic and
human resources. These problems are not insoluble. But as one
very authoritive political commentator said recently, “the prob-
lems that beseech this nation have not been solved. Maybe our
representative government is not representative, enough.”

In the scientific world, change is known as a constant. Our
only hope is that the necessity of change will be realized in the
political and social worlds.. If it is not. the end is near.

Alas Babylon. now we shall live in the deep caverns of the
underworld.

Sunny Day
Was Like
Black Hell

by DAVE TIERNAN

It was Wednesday. and Paul
and I were going golfing together
for the first time in five years.
We had written about the day for
four years while I was away in
the service. We wrote about the
day for the past year while Paul
was in Labrador in the service.
And now we were both home and
we were going golfing, just as
we had the summer after we grad-
uated high school five years ago.
It should have been a happy day
of nostalgic “remember the times
we,” but it wasn’t.

We went through the motions
of driving to our favorite course.
and playing the required 18 holes.

and having a few beers to quench V

our thirst — but it wasn’t a happy
day.

Paul and I talked quite a bit
as we went through the motions.
but it was about our future. not
about our past.

“Sometimes when I was in the

Goose (the Air Force base in Lab-
rador is at Goose Bay) I got de-
pressed and rationalize by say-
ing that I am serving my coun-
try and all,” Paul said. “But when
you come back to the United
States after being away for a year
you can see that maybe its not
worth it to do your time in the
service. Maybe the violent way is
théright way. Kennedy and King
and a lot of guys in Vietnam were
good guys, and look where they
are. (Paul was referring to John
F. Kennedy, for the news on the
radio about Bobby Kennedy had
caused us to question the plight
of “Good guys.”)

I don’t think Paul really meant
what he said. for he said it be-
cause he was depressed. In five
years Paul had realized that the
world is not as rosy as he had
thought it was when he was
younger. We all grow up and see
the world as it really is. We go
through a period of discontent and
then slip into the pattern of our
older years. But Paul couldn't un-
derstand how adults could have
allowed the world to become the
world it is. and not only do noth-

ingpto improve it. but acce t it

idiots. Maybe they have forgot-

Someday  
Let’s Hope

By GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor
The flag hangs at half
mast for the third time since
November 22, 1963.

The nation again mourns.

First John F. Kennedy. Then
Martin Luther King. And now
another Kennedy, Robert
Francis.

The assassin’s bullet. The
striking down of a man who
asked for liberal change for
America. The Ghetto. The Ne-
gro. The White. The Poor. The
Democracy.

They are all problems.

“If we do not make com-
mon cause to save the good
old ship (g the Unior on this
voyage.” said Abraham Lin-
coln in 1861. “Nobody will
have a chance to pilot her on
another voyage.”

Now, let's make Democracy
safe for the world.

The hope. The work. The
future.

and raise their children to accept"

it. too.

“Do they think we’re idiots?”
Paul questioned as we walked
down the fairway. “Did our par-
ents really think we’d spend time
and money for education and not
use it to improve the world?"

Paul was making sense-, but I
felt that maybe adults would see
it differently. Just because adults
don't condone our challenge of
the society in which we live does-
n’t mean that they feel we're

Gun Law Vs
NRA . . . It’s

NowEminent

The Greyhound bus pulled into
Washington, D. C., bus terminal.
Raul Torres stepped off the bus
and walked up New York Ave. to-
ward the White House. He was
within one block of the presiden-
tial mansion when he pulled his
rifle from its sheath. He fired one
armor-piercing bullet into the air
before police captured him.

This was in 1966. Raul Torres
was an escapee from a mental
hospital and a fugitive from a

' warrant for his arrest for threat-

ening President Johnson by let-
ter. Torres was captured before he
could shoot anyone. but other lu-
natics have committed their
crimes. Medgar Evers, John Ken-
nedy, Martin Luther King, and
now Robert Kennedy have been
shot. Perhaps better gun control
laws would have prevented these
tragedies.

A recent Harris poll indicated
that the American people want
gun control laws. Results of the
poll, published in the April 13
New York Times, indicate that 71
per cent of Americans favor the
passage of Federal laws that
would place tight controls over
the sale of guns in this country.
Sixty-five per cent of gun owners
want legislation.

But little has been done. Sena-
tor Thomas Dodd of Connecticut
has tried to introduce gun control
legislation. The National Rifle
Association (NRA) has blocked
Dodd’sAproposals. The NRA has
approximately 730,000 members
who are strong believers in the
right to carry firearms. The NRA’s
ideal is “the armed citizen,” who
has the right to shoot and the gun
to do it with. In recent years,
NRA members have sent millions
of letters to Congress protesting
gun control legislation.

A Memorial Service for Sen-
ator Robert F. Kennedy will be
held Sunday at 3 p.m. in Heinz
Chapel.

The university_community is
invited to attend.

Simon Sez . . .

Leave the Driving to US.

Even though President Johnson
has tried to discourage foreign
travel. it seems that more and
more young Americans are going
abroad this year. In fact. the ma-
jority of them are traveling with
all expenses paid for by the Unit-
ed States government. Of this ma-
jority. the largest part is getting
an all-expense paid trip to the re-
gion of the world known as South-
East Asia.

Now I know you have guessed
that I'm talking about young men
in military service. But let’s not
consider them as soldiers —— let’s
regard them as young men in an
exotic land on a supervised tour.
one which affords many oppor-
tunities for relaxation. contem-
plation. and meeting different and
interesting people.

The young man on‘Uncle Sam’s
tour will be provided with ample
leisure facilities after performing
his exhaustive duties. There is
probably no place more restful
than the base hospital (except per-
haps the morgue). and activities
such as showing battle scars or
examining splints are sure to pro-
vide many leisurely hours for the
young traveler.

 
  

Are We Dead

Just Asleep,
Or Frozen?

Why isn’t there a game called
“peace” for kids to play rather
THAN “war”? Why is it that Bon-
nie and Clyde are bigger public
heroes than Albert Schweitzer?
Why is it that people talk at peo-
ple but not to people? Why is it
that adolescents want to “blow”
their minds than improve them?
“Red, yellow, black or white,
nothing but reflected light,—the
Lord is color blind.” Why have
we made a movie out of the “St.
Valentine’s Day Massacre”?

Why is it that Martin Luther
King was killed and H. Rap
Brown was not? Why is it easier
to drink than to think? Why do
magazines write articles on Ne-
gro burning stores but ignore the
fact that the Ku Klux Klan mem-
bers burn churches? Why do peo-
ple look at a person’s hair more
than they look at his heart?

Why is the “commuter bandit”

the biggest hero in Pittsburgh’s

ten their youthful ideals and now
accept their society rather than
live the way they had hoped when
they were younger. Maybe we,
the college students of today, will
grow old and accept society with-
out any challenge. Paul didn’t
think so.

“I don’t care if I’m 60.” he
said. “I'll never be satisfied with
violent methods. or prejudice. or
. . .” Paul broke off. and stared
out the window of the speeding
car as we headed home. I had to
agree with Paul for I have faith
in my generation.

When I see movies like The
Graduate and Guess Who’s Com-
ing to Dinner and hear songs
about love. and people. I have
faith in my generation. We may
grow old and accept society. but
it will be a society that has bene-
fitted from many hours of think-
ing. discussion. frustration. and
wondering by my generation. But.
all the thinking in the world
won’t solve the problems of our
time.

Paul and I came to the same
conclusion as he pulled up in
front of my hose to let me out.
“But what can we do?” Paul ask-
ed me as he opened his car door.

‘Macarthur Park’

It is a rarity in the record busi-
ness to find an album where one
son. and words of a few of the
others. dominate the singer. but
this is the case in Richard Har-
ris’ album. A Tramp Shining. The
songs. particularly “Macarthur
Park.” and not Harris’ voice. are
the major items on display. The
composer of all the songs on the
album. Jimmy Webb. who wrote
“Up. Up. and Away” and “By the
Time I Get to Phoenix.” has cre-
ated this album around the stun-
ning “Macarthur Park." but has
run into trouble filling up the
other eight bands.

-The foundation song. “Macar-
thur Park.” is a seven—minute
piece of love. and how it ends. It
concerns the falling out between
a man and the love of his life. It
begins in despair. recalling the

I didn't have a pat answer for
Paul. for there are many things
we can do to improve things. But.
where to start is quite a problem.
It would be easy for us to become
frustrated with the “big picture"
and complain and question the
“status quo" without doing any-
thing about it. saying that we
don’t know where to start. I would
be very easy for us to do that.
That’s what our parents did. isn’t
it? ? ?

good times the lovers had in the
park. with the music evoking a
deep sense of melancholia at the
losing of the man's lover.

But the theme of love quickly
vanishes after a deeper examina-
tion of the lyrics: for you realize
that Macarthur Park is the place
where all of man‘s dreams come
to an end. It is the place where
they melt. and it the place where
man knows that he will never
dream the dream again: hence the
line “I'll never have the recipe
again."

Webb’s lyrics are deceptively
subtle, but are able to bring out
the images and ideas to which he
is alluding. The song could really
be said to be in the life of the
“everyman” who fails at his
dreams and reconciles himself to
something I e s s t h a n his ideal

And They Buried Him,

. . . Near His Mountains

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

Big Sam was one helluva guy.
He was the biggest and toughest
stud in the area. He might be nice
to you once in a while. but most
of the time he wasn't. To most of
the smaller guys around. Big Sam
was a real bastard.

I remember one time when
Teeny Tiny was walking down
the street and Sam was standing
on the corner doing his nothing
usual. Teeny saw him standing
there. but there was no way you
could sidestep Big Sam. He was
there. and it was the law that you
had to acknowledge him. So
Teeny said hello to Sam. and Sam
said hello to Teeny. and'then Sam
beat the tar out of Teeny. No rea-
son see: he just wanted something
to do. And Teeny took it because
there wasn‘t anything you could
do when Big Sam wanted to beat
the tar out of you.

But Sam was a funny type of
guy. One time he was walking
the area. when he saw some out-
siders causing some trouble wi_th
Teeny. Well Big Sam got angry.
and flew into the guys. and beat
the tar out of them. And then he
asked Teeny if he was okay. and
Teeny said yes. and Sam said that
was good. and he walked away.
and Teeny scratched his head.

But like I said before, Sam was
a real bastard, and most of the
guys didn’t believe Teeny when
he told them what Sam did. They
said that Teeny must have been
drunk, or high on grass, or both,
or neither. Teeny swore he wasn’t,
and I remember one of the guys
saying that he sure would like to
have Big Sam around if he was
going to get stomped. And some
of the guys agreed, and some of
the guys disagreed, but it didn’t
really matter because all of them
knew that Sam was Sam’s man,
and no one else’s.

But Sam went too far once. and
it spelled the end for him. See.
Sam had it bad for one of the

world. Harris’ singing of this song
is quiet and thoughtful, but there
are spots where his voice is un-
able to keep up with the volume
of the orchestra, and this creates
an unfortunate overshadowing.

But “Macarthur Park" is the
only song that is truly impressive.
or that lives up to Webb's advanc-
ed billing as one of “Hollywood’s
Greatest New Talents."

The melodies of the other eight
tracks have the tendency to blend
together into one long. inconse-
quential song that could be sung
by a Frank Sinatra or a Barbra
Stresisand. Indeed. you must lis-
ten to the album several times in
order to tell the songs apart at
all. They sound so similar. in fact.
that you cannot even hum them to
yourself. and this is a sure sign
of failure.

Webb’s lyrics, however, are on

a much higher level of compe-

guys sisters. I don't remember
who's sister; it might have been
Roach‘s. but it doesn’t matter.
Anyway. Sam wanted this girl
real bad. and he was fuming be-
causd she kept turning him down.
Now other girls had turned Sam
down. but he was gone over this
one. and being that he thought
himself such a great lover. it was
a blow to his ego. So he got angry.
and when Sam got angry. he did-
n’t care about anything. He didn’t
care what other people thought or
did. because Sam was always
right to Sam. So he waited in the
shadows for her. and he grabbed
her. an.d had her. and that was
that for Sam. But not for the other
guys. A

When Roach found out. he al-
most went out of his mind. He
told Teeny that he was going to
get Big Sam. but Teeny told him
that he was crazy and that he
would just get killed. Teeny said
that he would get the other small
guys in the area and they would
get Sam. Roach listened and said
that it would be all right.

So one night when Sam was
standing on the corner, Roach
walked by and called Sam some-
thing had, and Sam ran after him.
Roach ran down an alley where
the other guys were waiting, and
two hours later the cops found
Big Sam stomped, and cut, and
dead.

But what I remember most
about Big Sam was his funeral.
Everyone was there. even the
guys who got him. The preacher
was dressed in black. and was pre-
tending to be very sad. just like

everyone else. But when I looked _

at their faces. I could see they
were all gald that the big guy
had gotten his. And I’ll never for-
get what the preacher said.

“Here lies Big Sam. whom we
all knew. God shed his graces on
he.”

And then they buried Sam near
his majestic purple mountains.
and under his f ruited plains.

Carries Harris Album

tence than his music. Including
“Macarthur Park,” there are three
other songs, “Paper Chase,” “In
the Final Hours,” and “A Tramp
Shining” which contains excellent
images that keep the listener oc-
cupied in trying to decipher their
meanings.

As for the performance of Har-
ris. I think he would be better off
reciting Shakespeare than recit-
ing some of Webb’s songs. His
voice is pleasant. but the only
things that save him on a few
songs are the excellent orchestra-
tion and tinty background sing-
ing that cover up for the inade-
quacies of his vocal range.

This album is already a big
seller. but if you buy .it, don’t
look for much besides “Macar-
thur Park.” It is this song that is
selling the album. and it is this
important piece of music.that
makes the remainder of the album
more palatable for the listener.
