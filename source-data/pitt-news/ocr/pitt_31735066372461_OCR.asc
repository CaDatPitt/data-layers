Pitt Med School Faces Debts, Accreditation Loss

By SETH LUBOVE

Pitt‘s School of Medicine. which
instituted record tuition hikes this
summer.‘ is facing a more tha'n $2.8
million deficit this fiscal year ( l98l-
X2). ,

In addition. Pitt has had to divert
more than $l2.9 million from its
general operating budget since I975
to cover the difference between the
medical school’s expenditures and
its revenues.

These areonly a few of the hard
fa_cts facing the medical school

which were revealed in a status
report sent to (iov. Richard Thorn-

burgh by Dr. Donald Icon. dean of

the School of Medicine.

“If the problems of academi‘c
space. budget and tuition support
are not solved promptly. the school‘s
accreditation status will be at risk
and a ma_jor Commonwealth

~resouree will be jeopardized.” I.eon

writes in the report. g
The report focuses on five major
points concerning the medical
school. ,
0 The future of the School of

Pitt student Kevin Mc-
Keown found himself all
dressed up with no place to
go when Penn State devas-
tated the Panthers 48-14
Saturday. “Momentum is
like a locomotive, and
when it got turned around
we couldn't stop It,'’ Pitt
coach Jackie Sherrill said.
Adding up with the Lam-
bert trophy, which had
been housed at Pitt the last
two years. For details on

the game, see page 10.

 0 The accreditation of the School

0 The medical school research
facility;

'0 The budget issue:

0 Tuition and medical student
support.

‘The most important problem with
the budget. I.eon writes. is the con-
tinual deficits the medical school has
experienced since I974. Pitt‘s sub-
sidy to the school to cover this year's

deficit of $2.X3l.()()() amounts to

approximately S5.l95 per student,

“The failure of the Common-
wealth to increase its appropriation
(commensurately) with inflation
since I972 is the direct cause of Pitt

having the highest public medical’
school tuition in the United States '

and the university having to subsid-
IIL‘ each student over $5.000 per

year. This subsidy is a major disad-

vantage to other portions of the urti-
versity vyherc the funds should be
allocated." I.eon writes.

According to a general operating
budget contained in the report.

On The Arts

Walking past the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. there is a dark. shad-
owy doorway and a sign:
“Closed. Lack of Funds.” Carne-
gie Library announces it will
remain open only three days per
week. Three local theatre com-
panies fold and the remaining
two plead desperately for

. The future of Pittsburgh‘s art
world is bleak. according to
David Stock. the conductor of
the Pittsburgh New Music
Ensemble.

In a University Honors Pro-
gram sponsored Noontime I.ec-
ture entitled: “Rcaganomics and
the Arts.“ Stock warned of the
devastating effects Reaganomics
will have on Pittsburgh‘s small
art production companies.

  Reaganomics

On Health Care

By JAMES MURPHY

The Reagan ‘Administration
favors reducing government
involvement in the health servi-
ces by supporting block grants.
reducing medicare allocations
and proposing a pre-paid health
plan. said Pitt economics and
psychiatry professor Richard
Frank.

Frank’s speech was part of a
service Rcaganomics sponsored
by the University Honors
Program. - ,

The Reagan administration
believes that Health Service
Agencies 'aren‘t operating at '
maximum efficiency because
their innovation is stifled by
government regulations. Frank
said. I

He cited the method by which
the government appropriates
money to the states for health
services as an example of what
Reagan perceives as over-
regulation. .

Stock.

said. “it is very difficult for small
art organizations to receive aid.
"lihcy must be an already estab-
lished company, have a success-
ful track record of survival. and

He explained that the N.E.A.

These grants are given to states
with specifications on what pro-
grams will be funded and how
much money should be allocated
for them. i

“This method leaves little
room for decision-making at the
state or local level." Frank said.

Instead of these types of
grants. Reagan supports a block
grant program. Frank said.
These grants allow communities
to have a choice in how their
money is spent. he said.

But the drawback to block
grants is that the reduction of

lie shows enough interest to
supply at first.

At the close of the Carter
Administration. the projected
i9so—si N.E.A. fiscal budget was
I70 million dollars. he said. It

, might seem like a lot. butin pers-

pective with the remainder ofthc

multi-billion dollar ll_S. budget..-
Stock said. “This total proposed

sum is less than the money our

government now spends on mil-

itary bands."

Luckily. he said. there are
enough people who prefer sym-
phonies to military bands. and
who have rallied against the pro-

t of Reaganomics on

federal regulation increases the
likelihood of misappropriation
of funds. according to Frank.
/.
Reagan supports the program
because it would place the-
burden of health service mainte-
nance oh the states. Frank said.

“The block} grant signals the
possibility of the federal govern-

ment severing all ties with health _

services." Frank said.

In addition to altering funding
methods. Reagan’ supports the
idea ofa pre-paid health plan,

According to Frank. Reagan

posed cuts and succeeded in con-
vincing the government the
N.E.A. plays an essential role in
supportingthe arts.The question
remaining is. how important will
supporting the arts be to our
government.

Stock explained why smaller
organizations will be among the
hardest hit by this lack of
funding.

“A Ismail organi/ation with a
budget of fifty to sixty tliousand
dollars might receive twelve
dollars from the
N.E.A. That’s one third of its
total budget. It is impossible to
exist without that money or to
make it up.”

7 For Pittsburgh. that will mean
fewer films. libraries. plays and

contends that the rising cost of
health care is caused by the way
in which hospitals and physi-
cians charge for their services.

They are paid on a “pay by
service" method. which the
administration believes allows
for diagnostic and prescriptive
overkill. Frank explained.

Instead of charging patients
for the amount of tests run. hos-
pitals and physicians would be
compensated on a flat-fee basis
under the administration's plan.
Frank said.

“The physician would receive
no more than the insured cover-

most importaintly. fewer artists
producing work.
“Withoutthe incentive. there
will be no art.” Stock said.
Stock disagreed with Reagan's
belief that the deficit caused by

‘the N.E.A. cuts would be picked

up by the private sector.

“The part of the public that
most supports the art/s is the 70
percent and higher tafx bracket."
he said. “(‘orporations donate to
the arts as his write-offs; it is

tlprofita ble.

"With the new tax reduction.
the present 70 percent group will
only be taxed on 50 percent. lhat
extra 20 percent will not be spent
on donations. because they will
not have the need to. and the rest
of us aren‘t rich enough to cover

. importantl_v.

the loss." he continued.

Is there a recourse after that’?

Stock said no.

If put into effect. he believes
Reagan’s budget cuts will reverse

twenty years ofstruggle and pro- )

gress the N.I5..A. has made in
reaching its present point. More

age. thereby eliminating the pos-
sibility of overtreatment.“ Frank
said. ~ ‘I

The administration believes
the plan would create‘ more com-
petition and thereby make health
care more efficient and less
costly, Frank said.

The plan also involves a reduc-

tion in tax-deductible insurance
plans. Frank said. Currently.‘
premiums paid for health insur-
ance are «tax-deductible. but

under the new plan. only a set‘

amount of insurance is deducti-

blc. This would reduce the incen-‘

By LAWRENCE LEDERER

Comic poetry with a sense of

real seriousness might be hard to
imagine. Yet in poetry and in
other writing. in order to clearly
tell the “truth" about the world.
writers must have a wide emo-
tional stance since this is what is
found in life.

I)r. Edwin ()chcster. associate '

professor of English and director
of the writing program at Pitt is
one prop'onent of this view.

“A strong comic component
doesn't necessarily mean the
writing has no seriousness to
offer.“ he said. “For example.
look at Shakespeare's comedies:
they‘re lots of fun but still serious
in that their talking about real
things and real world influences.

Ochester. a rather personable
man. married with two children.
should knowthat comic poetry is
not just fluff. His poetry writing
is viewed as having a comic tone.
yet still serious in that it has
important messages to offer.

He has published numerous
books. most ofthem poetry. and
is in the process of writing
another. His poems and stories
have been published in many

More Bargains
at the  

Book Center

I 4000 5th Ave.

anthologies. magazines and peri-
odicals. He modestly feels
“lucky" about this. One thing
that especially pleases him is that
some of his writings have been
read in different‘ high schools
across the country._

Yet. aside from the large
amount of work he puts into
publishing. he has donea consid-
erable amount for Pitt’s English
writing program.

In addition to being the poetry
editor of the University of Pitts-
burgh Press and coordinator of
the‘ Drew Heinz Literature Prize
for the writing of short fiction.
Ochester served as chairperson
of the ad hoc committee of writ-
ing faculty. which initiated Pitt‘s
current graduate degree program
in writing.

Ochester also was instrumen-
tal in initiating undergraduate
poetry writing Courses at Pitt.

When he first came here in I970 --

from the University of Florida.
Pitt didn‘t offer many non-
fiction writing courses. He was
instrumental in the planning of

V ITIOYC.

"This produced more coher-
ence in the writing program." he
said. “In I972. we offered only

one undergraduate poetry writ-
ing course that had an enmi-
lment of approximately 20
students. Currently. we have

about 300 undergraduate writing

majors.

()chester said he believes he is
very lucky to be at Pitt because
he feels the student body here is a
lot more sophisticated than that
of other schools.

“What I mean by sophistica-
tion is that Pitt students have an
extremely deep sense of their
roots." he said. “They are a lot
more sophisticated in terms of
world experience. and that’s why
we have such an interesting writ-
ing program.” ‘

For example. Oehester
pointed out that while they were
still undergraduates at Pitt. stu-

dents had articles published in

various well-known magazines
such as The Atlantic Mon!/1/_i'.
Esquire‘. and Sports Illustrated
This is truly a remarkable
record that doesn‘t happen at
an_v other institution." he said.
“We have the oldest writing pro-
gram in the U.S.. started over 50
years ago. Yet’. the program is
still in the process of growing."

('m1mIm'd from I/mgr‘ um’
which breaks down revenues and

-expenditures since fiscal year I975-

76. the highest deficit the medical
school experienced came last year.
in FY 80-8|. when the deficit
reached $3,042,445.

As it has since I974. the university
covered the whole deficit last year.
resulting in a subsidy of $5'.bl3 for
each of the 542 students enrolled in
the medical school.

On the expenditure side of the
budget. annual faculty salary
increases “have been well -below the
inflation rate.“ l.eon states. Salaries
for medical school faculty have

increased on the average by only °

7. I3 percent since l975.accordingto
the operating budget.

The smallest salary hike was only
.03 percent between FY 79 and FY
80. while theilargcst was 20.3l per-
cent between FY 80 and FY XI.

On the revenue side. while tuition

has increased since FY 75-76 by 350 ,
' percent.

federal subsidies to the
medical school have been reduced to
nothing for the current fiscal year.

The medical school’s “general
operating budget revenues have not
kept pace with inflationary cost
increases. resulting in serious

,impacts on its basic science pro-

grams. tuition charges as increasing
university subsidy which cannot be
long supported.“ Leon writes;

‘The Pit! ’.i/vzm-.4-. jMm1'dia.t'.i N()i\i’(‘i11/‘)\(’I‘ 3(I. T98 ‘ ii

The increasing cost of attending
Pitt's medicaltschool is also cited as a
major problem facing the school.

“Tuition costs are now so high
that they cause a major practice
career choice problem for future

Pennsylvania physicians and they -

are beginning to limit access to med-
ical education for some Pennsylva-
nia residents from less wealthy
families.“ Leon states. V

Tuition for in-state uppcrclass-
men was increased I7'percent this
year. while it was increased 32 per-
cent for freshmen. Tuition for out-
of-state students was increased even
higher $l3.35() for freshmen and
SE! l.85() for upperelassmen. I

The tuition levels at Pitt “are
extraordinarily high.“ Leon writes.
adding that the mean four-year debt
for a Pennsylvania student is
$45.()()(). and with accumulated
interest. the debt goes up to almost
$75.()()(). _

“As tuition rapidly increases.
indebtness rapidly increases and
high interest rates make the problem
severe. Fear of future debt is begin-
ning to make students of rural and
less wealthy family backgrounds
reconsider applying to medical
school. This limits access to medical
education." the report says. “If they
do elect to incur the debt. they must
turn away from rural and family
practice to other specialty careers in

which their large debt burdens can
be liquidated more rapidly."

As a solution to the problem of
skyrocketing tuitions. the medical
school had recommended that the
state increases its appropriation I5
percent next year. and increase the
appropriations thereafter at a rate
corresponding to inflation rate.

The school also recommends that
the state create a “low—cost loan pro-
gram” formedical students that will
“make it possible to escalate tuition
somewhat to meet infl_ationary costs
in future years." As part ofthc same
proposal. the school recommends
that the loan program have a loan
forgiveness provision as a reward for
Pennsylvania.

The accreditation section of the
report centered primarily on the
recent (October I980) accreditation
evaluation of the medical school by
the Liaison Committee on Medical
Education (LCM E) and the State
Board of Medical Eduation and
lficensurc. I

The I.(‘ME report ‘listed several

areas ofconccrn. including a lack of

success in recruiting chairmen for
basic sciences departments. an acute
shortage of academic space. ques-
tionable fiscal stability.‘ inadequate
communications of decisions made
in the academic chain of command
and with students regarding tuition.

Board of Medical Examiners as a
measure of teaching succes ‘. and the
monitoriifg of the student counsel-
ing service.

Although the I.(‘MF. awarded the

medical school a th ree-year accred it— ‘

ation. it required the school to com-
plete a one—ycar progress report by
.Ian. I. I982.

’:l.eon‘s report to the governor
states that as of Sept. 20. the basic
science department organi/ation
“has been clarified and imple-
mented.” although chairmen were
still needed for the dapartments of
anatomy. biochemistry. pharmacol-
ogy. and physiology.

l)escribing the lack of stability of
finances in the medical school as a
“thorny issue." I.eon writes in the
report that even with accurate long-
range budget planning. major tui-
tion hikcs. “substantial increases in
clinical practice fee recovery.” and
tight management control. the inedi-
cal school has not been able to keep
up with inflation.

The medical school research facil-
ities portion.of the report centers
chiefly on two construction pi'ojccts
the school and the University Health
(‘enter have proposed: a new inedi-
cal school building. and a shared ser-
vices facility to be built in the
courtyard that currently serves as a
parking lot for (‘hildrcn‘s. liyc and
liar. and «I’resb_vterian—Univcrsity
Hospitals. '

I.con explains in the report that
/construction of the buildings is the
best way for the school to resolve, its
problem of lack of academic space.

Funding for the construction of

the buildings is seed money. the.

report states. because operational
costs and research programs will be
funded entirely by research grants
and donations.

I.con also states that the Howard
Hughes Foundation has expressed
an interest in providing at Howard
Hughes Research Institute at I’itt‘s
medical school if the space can be
provided.

If

The Party’s Over

Tuition never seems to stop going up. the medi-
cal school is in debt and in danger of losing its
accreditation. the geography department is get-
ting axcd. student loans are harder to get but
who cares‘? Pitt lost to Penn State.

The score. Penn State 48. Pitt I4. says it all. We
lost all the marbles: state bragging rights. number
one ranking. pride everything.

Such are the priorities which have fallen upon a
student and administrative body that has
come to expect’ winnfng. not losing. and espe-
cially not by such a lopsided margin.

Despite all the ills that have bcfallen Pitt. none
is of greater consequence than losing to Penn
State. Who cares if tuition goes through the roof
and keeps on going‘? We’_ll figure out a way to pay
it even if we all have to flip hamburgers at
McDonald’s from midnight to 5  then go to
class. Failing that. mom and dad always have a
sympathetic streak.

Who cares ifthc medical school is in the red by
more—than $2.8 million this year and will proba-
bly be i.n the red for some time to come‘? The
university will find some way to bail the school
out with an extra million dollars or so that it has
tucked away. Of course bailing out the medical
school comes at the expense ofithe geography
department and the advising center but who
cares‘? After all. what‘s more important to Pitt
adniinistrators‘? Docs or rocks‘?

Who cares ifstudents loans are harder to come
by. thanks to President Reagan and Reaganom-
ics‘? Student loans were a pain in the neck to get
anyway. what with all those forms and whatnot
to have to fill out. Why. all you have todo to get a
ticket to the game is go to the ticket window and
present your student identification. That's a lot
easier than applying for a student loan.

Well. the fact is that if we don't care about
tuition. the medical school. the geography
department andstudent loans. nobody else will
either.

Sure. Pitt lost to Penn State. btit wcfve lost to
them 39 times already since the rivalry began.

Somehow. classes started on time Monday morn- ,

ing. finals. as usual. started earlierthan expected.
and the beer flowed at Friday‘s fraternity
parties in that order.

Pitt will play Penn State again next year. prob-
ably with just as much at stake as there was this
year. It will be the last game of the season. as it
always has been. and bragging rights will go to
the victor.

In the meantime. Pitt students have a lot of
things to worry about besides football, all of
which deserve just as much attention as does the
Pitt—Penn State rivalry.

Maybe holding a pep rally for increased appro-
priations on the steps of the Capitol Building in
Harrisburg with the same intensity that we
devote to the football game wouldn’t be such a
bad idea. .

Get Rid Of ‘Doorntsday’ Plane

l)car President: I. .loc Sikspak.
American. take pen in hand to grind
an axe or two. You got to get rid of
that there "doomsday plane.“ It
makes us citi/ens nervous.

I am down in Frank's Place nurs-
ing a cold Molsson. when I read in
the paper how you took _voiir first
ride in this doomsday plane. which
sits around Wasliington“rcady to
whisk you up in the air for 72 hours
in case you push the wrong button.

I see you said the experience was
“very cncouraging‘,' and having the
plane handy gives you a “sense of
confidence." So I ask Frank what he
thinks of giving a~presidcnt a sense
of confidence in case he pushes the
wrong button.

"I)on‘t listen to the president.

Joe." says Frank. "Hc‘sjtist trying to,

make it sound like fun. Actually.thc
last thing he wants to do is fly off in
that plane with nuclear bombs

exploding all oi .r the place. Don't‘

forget. it only holds him and 93
other people and who‘s he going to
leave behind?" '

“Stoekman and Allen and,Haig
for starters." says I promptly. “No
wonder he figures it's ‘very encou-
raging.‘ Then he can take his wife.
Nancy. and..."

“No. he can‘t. .loc. That plane's
America's command post. And
there‘s no room for an attractive
lady and two hairdressers."

“Just when they were getting the
White" House together. too.” says I.
shaking my head. “But I guess hc‘s
got to take the tip-top experts who
know about running this country.”

“Maybe so." says Frank. “but
which 93 Washington columnists is
he going to pick‘? And then his
friends will be calling: ‘Hi there.

wondering if you'd like to get away
for a leisurely wcckcnd shooting
pheasants under glass at otir littlc
hideaway in the lesser Aiitihcs.
Within six minutes.“

“So he brings along the Mclloiis."
says I.

“Joe. you don't know the social
scene in Washington. He invites the
Mcllons and the Tuttlcs will never
speak to him again."

“At least he gets himself off the
ground." says I.

“It‘s not going to be any bed of
roses tip there. .loc." says Frank.
“You cvcrbech on a long flight‘? The

johns get stopped up. the soap runs

otit. you’vc seen the movie. there's
not cnotigh pillows and blankets to
go around. and the dinners all taste

like the lunches which all taste like
the breakfasts which all taste like
boiled styrofoam. And you can't
sleep because of the one big worry
on your mind."

‘.'What‘s tha‘t‘."‘ says I.’ ,

“Will there be anybody there to
meet _vou when you land?" says
Frank.

So. Mr. President. I figure you
could sell" this doomsday plane to

I.cc Iacocca or somebody who needs y

it. Us citi/cns would feel a lot safer

knowing you and us were all in the '

same boat.

In the end. I got to agree with
Frank. “A captain." I-"rank says.
“ought to go down with his planet."

Scientists Offered
Convincing Arguments

"Dear Editor:

I want to offer some comments
concerning your informative
article about the modified gen-
eral cdtication requirement for
Bachelor of Science candidates

Surely when Professor
Rcschcr referred to the strong
feelings of the natural science
faculty. he did not intend this
remark as a reason to accept
their amendment of the require-
ments. Hc only requested careful
attention to thcirargumcnts. The

amendment passed begiiuse the
arguments were convincing.
Your reference to Reschcr‘s
preference for cultured scientists
carried the implication that there
is a dichotomy between science
and culture. Isn't it time to recog- .
mic that culture has become var-
ied and that modern science is
one of its major ingredients’?
Moreover. a large percentage of

_ scientists are enthusiastic partici-

pants in traditional culture. .

Buy A Chair, -
Ax Geography

I)car F.ditor:

By now a great many people asso-
ciated with the llnivcrsity of Pitts-
bu.rgh should know that the
geography department has been tar-
geted for termination by I983. How-
ever. I don‘t believe that enough
people understand the implications
inuolvcdj .

l)can Rosenberg claims that the
uiiixcrsity will save $ll)(l.I)()() by dis-
solving a department that is already
weak (despite the fact that he weak-
encd it so that he could dissolve it!).
But at the same time Sti().()()() was
spent on new furniture for the
Forbes Quadrangle and well over
that amount was spcntfor the furni-
ture provided. for the Salad Co. on
the second floor of the Quad, Where

 

 

are the-priorities of tliis‘univcrsity'.’!
Time and again Roscn_bcrg has
claimed that the cost of the depart-
ment is the only reason he has to ax
it. Yet. when the chairman offers to
retire so that his salary can be used
to hire two new junior faculty in
order that the department he revital-
i/cd. Rosenberg turns up ‘his nose.
Ifthis is the attitude oftheadmin—
istration. then watch out. every-
body. Hillman willnecd new furni4
ttire soon and I wonder which
department will be axed to pay for
it'.’ By the year 2000 we should have
plenty of nice chairs to sit in. but the
only thing left to maior in will be
thumb-twiddling. ii

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

V The dream that had survived
through l() games this season. a
wealth of inexperience and asceti-
sion to the No. l spot in the college
football rankings. was suddenly
over Saturday for the Pitt Panthers
in a blur of legs and two la/y. arch-
ing passes floating slowly against the
backdrop ofa grey. overcast sky.

Of all the memories of this sur—
prising l98l season. the image the
once—beatcn Pitt Panthers are likely
to remember most is the back of

7 Penn Statc’s quicksilver flanker
Kenny .lackson‘s jersey fluttering in
the wind as he loped into the end
7one and held the football aloft.

In the aftermath of fumbles. inter-
ceptions. and penalties by Pitt. and
the hardy-nosed play of the Penn
State Nittany Lions. .lackson‘s two
third quarter. touchdown strikes
argueably rank with best ofexplana-
tions of Pitt’s fall from No. land the
undefeated ranks to Penn State. 48-

60.260. V
‘ Jackson. who entered the game
with a mere l4catches this season. in
two quick sprints downfield. brokea
l4-l4 third quarter tie with catches
of 42 yards and 45 yards on consecu-
tive series.

“He just outran us." said Pitt
safety Tom Flynn.

It was an unlikely combination to
break the ’anthers back Jackson.
who has taken a statistical backseat
to running back Curt Warner all
_year. while Penn. State sophomore
quarterback Todd Blackledge. who
finished the day I2 of 23 for 2h2
yards and 3 touchdowns. has
endured criticism that he can’t pass.

Saturday. both players and the
entire Penn State team. harried. 9-2
survivors of a murderous schedule.
were basking in the sweet glow of
vi'ndication. And. oddly enough.
‘thankful for a schedule that may
have prevented them from finishing
even higher than their current No.

'l here it was‘. plain to see. Plain

The first. a 28-yard post pattern.
came on a whistling arrow from
Marino. that Collins hauled in des-
pite the defender who was cloaking

him like a second jersey. After the‘

second score. a leaping 24-yard catch

{as he tightroped the end line. it

looked like Pitt would be the team
doing the drubbing. Until the room
came down on Pitt under the force
of seven turnovers and l3 penalties.

The Panther defense which had

ithrottled the Penn State offense and.‘

more specifically its ground game.
began to crack. Penn State. taking
over on its own 20 following an end
’/one interception by Roger Jackson.
qrovc 80 yards in eight plays to pull
within a touchdown when fullback
Mike Meade bulled over from the
l-yard line.

Penalties and turnovers killed two
other Pitt drives in the second qua r-
ter while Penn State‘s offense slowly

got on track through thelair. Then.

with just over three minutes left in
the half. Blackledge hit Jackson for
a 52~yard gain that set up Black—-
ledge‘s 8—yard touchdown run the
very next play on a quarterback

fdraw.

And the Penn State team. which
had not panicked after falling
behind l4-0. went intothe locker
room confidently with a l4—|4 tie.

“This team has a fire in it. They
know how to come back."&aid Penn
State Coach .loe P_aterno. “They
know how to play football and win
in the clutch.“

Once on track. the\Nittany Lions
never stopped rambling as they put
up 48 points while shutting out the
error-ridden Panthers the rest ofthe
way.

and when it got turned around we
couldn‘t stop it." said Pitt (‘oach
Jackie Sherrill. “They made some
great plays."

And some big plays. too. Beside
Jackson. who ended with five
catches for I58 yards. tight end Mike
MeCloskcy hauled in two key passes
for 72 yards. and (‘urt Warner. the
Lions l()()()—yard rusher. returned
from a hamstring injury to go almost
unnoticed with l()4 yards rushing.
Tack on a 9|-yard interception
return by Mark Robinson for a.
touchdown. and you have a rout.

And of course. there was Black-
ledge. who bore the brunt of the
criticism in both of Penn Statc‘s
losses this year. then came back
against Pitt to have what he called
“the best game of my life."

“We had a lot of high expectations
for this season. but we blew it
against Miami. We beat ourselves."
Blackledge said. “That's why l.~ feel
for Pitt. They're a good team.“

Despite the season—cnding loss. it
was an opinion generally shared by
most of Pitt's players. including
quarterback l)an Marino. who suf-
fered through a four-interception
afternoon.

“We still had a good season. We
would have liked to have gone unde-
feated and have a chance to go for
the national championship. but we
have to take this in stride." Marino
said. “Losing is a part of winning."

“l‘m proud ofeveryone. We‘re l()—
I. and I’m not gonna take any pity.
There‘s still another game.“ said Pitt
linebacker and team leader Sal Sun-
seri. "We’ll be alright‘. lt’s just that
we had it in our hands..."

And it slipped through. “It's just
something we have to accept."
Marino said.

Nobody said they had to like it.

AIM!‘

  

 

By BRETT DIAMOND

Twenty years ago. the work
ethic was more frequently men-
tioned as the key to success for a
collegiate athlete. A person who
gave the proverbial “l.l(l per-
cent.“ not only in games but also
in practice‘. often infected their

‘team with that “winning spirit."

Nowadays with the lure of scho—
larships. athletic talent is culti-
vated» in abundance. and often
wins a player a position on a
team.

So whenever someone such as
setter Maria Pere/ wins an award
for her efforts on the Pitt
women‘s Eastern champion vol-
leyball team. it's a throwback to
the old days. and to the work
ethic_ which has diminished
somewhat with the great influx
of talent in all sports.

Perez, a senior from Staten

‘ Island. N.Y.». considers herselfto

have “limited talent." but she
says she makes up for it with an
“obsession for practice."

“I love to practice." Perez says.

Her hard work and determina-
tion have made for a four—year
member of Pitt‘s team. and the
recipient of some prestigious
awards in the past year.

0 While the end of Pere7.‘s vol-
leyball career has been filled with
distinction. the beginning of her
interest in the sport was rather

A inauspicious. Actually. it wasn‘t

even her idea.

'Pere/. though born in the lJni—
ted States. didn‘t get her start in
volleyball until she was l5. when
-she was living in (ialica. -«Spain.
Pere/‘s cousin convinced her to
come out to a club team practice.
lhe coach there noticed her on
the sidelinespgave her a volley-
ball and told her to “get
acquainted with the wall.“

The “wall” any wall is the
standard partner of a setter in
volle_yball. The only way to
sharpen the skill is practice
again and again setting balls off
the wall when no one else is wil-
ling to keep working with you.

If it sounds like a monotonous
job. Pere/ will disagree. She
finds the “finesse“ of volleyball.
and setting. just as appealing as
the “power. speed and brains“
aspects of the game. And despite
some injuries she has suffered
over the years. she still retains the
same enthusiasm for the sport.

PCFCI finds the setting position
particularly enjoyable because
“it‘s mentally stimulating and
more challenging" to her than
any other position.

The dual demands of the
position a setter is both a de-
fensive player who‘s called on to
do a great deal ofdiving. and the
offensive quarterback. who calls
the plays and sets up teammates
for the spike. are responsibili-
ties Pere/. shoulders ably.

But while Pere/ enjoys the

'0 mental aspects of the game. the

A Part of Perez  

Setter Maria Perei (tar left) looks on as Judy Young finishes off one of Perez’s sets
into a point for the Lady Panthers.

physical rigors of volleyball have
taken their toll on her. Although
she's had a number of nagging
injuries over her four-year Pitt
career. this season Pere/ sus-
tained a knee injury that she
admits will probably end her
competitive volleyball career.
Pere/ was scheduled to
undergo knee surgery on
Thanksgiving Day. but her
hobbled but successful return to
action in the Eastern Association

for Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women regional tournament
earlier this month convinced her
to put off surgery until after Pitt
competes in the AIAW Nation-
als Dec. 9-l2. After that, shc’ll
probably have the surgery to
repair her torn knee cartilage.
lt’s a thought that: however
unpleasant. Pere/ reali/es she
must accept. Her keen sense of
humor. combined with her bub-
bly personality. agllovv her to

Armour photo
laugh at herself. even in the face
of a serious event.

“I guess my star has faded."
Pere/ says calmly. then smiles as
she looks away.

Hard work and desire can
overcome almost any obstacle.
except injury. lt's rarethat some-
one can accept the sudden end of
a passion so graciously. Maria
Pere/. like evcrythingelsc in vol-
leyball. will do it successfully.
