During the course of the school year the Pitt News
backs many worthy projects through news coverage and
editorials, but seldom do we have a chance to back sonic-
thing from which we ourselves get pleasure. Tonight,
though, and two weeks from tonight, we will see projects
which are not only worthy, but which also give us pleasure
-the Varsity Marching Band Review tonight and the Com-
mons Room Ball, December 18. ' »

We’re looking forward to seeing _the band march into
the hall tonight and, go through its routines of the past
football season, and We’re _looking forward to» seeing Benny‘
Benack- and the Panther and the Outstanding Bandsman
of the Year. Theband deserves credit and turning out to-
night to see/them will be our way of giving them that credit

: 7 . and at the same time treating ourselves to 2; top-notch show.

7 ,,We hope that the stimulating effects of the band music

  won’t wear off either, for the Commons Boom Ball is only
‘two weeks away. This is one of the social highpoints of
. the year and one of the -few timesthat the Commons Room

actually serves a functional purpose. ~ 1 ,

. ’It’s a good time to have a dance-—just‘before,the holi-
days-—-and the Commons Room is the perfect place to have
it. ,

lf you haven’t been to one of the Christmas Balls then
don’t miss it, and if you have been there you know it’s well
worth the price asked.

All in all it looks like a pretty good two weeks.

Spring in the Air

The mild winter this year has already set us to looking
for signs _of spring and we think we’ve found a sign in the
topsy-turvy relations of the Students for Democratic Ac-
tion and the-Students for America. It seems that the SFA
is being barred from some campuses as being too right wing,

"so the SDA, which has been accused of being a left wing

organization, is trying to protect the rights of the SFA.
Maybe a good snowstorm would help us ﬁgure it out.

Nowadays, even minor attempts at practical
jokes are foiled or die at birth. The other night,
a group of students in the University attempted

spirited away the C200-pound bronze panther from
the Dean of Men’s Lounge and lugged the cumber-
some animal and its pedestal down to an adminis-
trative oﬁ‘ice on the first ﬂoor. After posing for
a few pictures with a photographer who just hap-
pened to be‘ around, the group departed and the
panther remained astride the desk of the official‘.
The plotters had hoped the discovery of the animal
in the morning would cause a little head-scratching
and mirth for the students, and the official who
owned the desk and the students who might pass

Unfortunately, the plot was sqon discovered.
Though it probably had/n’t happened before and
won’t happen again during ‘the of‘ficial’s term of

on their lives when they confronted the bale-

office. Details of theproceedings from this point ‘

on are rather vague but, needless to say, the D.P.

about the fifth ﬂoor landing.

It Doesn't Pay * .. . g 
Thissad tale has a moral. Never, never, never
make Pitt News people your publicity chairmen.

Such arrangements hurt three parties: The socie-A 

ty, the chairman and the Pitt News.

The reason is simple: If. your publicity chair-
man is a good reporter, he becomes too "objective
about the copy“-iyour group sends him. He rates
his stories in, terms of where they belong in the
News and not; where he’d like to see them.

If, on the oiher hand, he’s not in a position of
responsibility on the paper, hes liable to incur
the wrath of the News Editor who has a nasty

habit of telling his reporters what, how much, and’

when he wants them to write. Reporters who seem
to exist on the News merely for the purpose of
writing copy about their pet activity often ﬁnd
themselves the object of bitter verbal chastisement
and possessors ofopuny clipping books.

We're Human (?). Honest!

The logical person to choose for a publiicty
chairman is not necessarily a journalist, but an
individual who understands our habits and out-
cries. We’re really quite easy to get _along with.
Like most humans, we can be swayed by con-
geniality, and an occasional free ticket can go a.
long way toward making us like you. i

‘Thee Students in Three obs During ‘Ten Months—With No Job-Hunting

Retail School Prov

By CECY

LINCOFF

Forty—two members of the School of Retailing have found
the answer to one of the most difficult problems of looking
for a Christmas job-—how to ﬁnd work without trudging

from _ store to store.

These lucky student—employees. have a pattern set for

them whereby they are placed iné

three different jobs during a 10-,
month period without weeks of
job-hunting.

At the beginning‘ of July, the
students attend classes on the 19th
and 20th ﬂoors of the Cathedral
while selling two days a week in
a department store. During this
time they study salesmanship and
hold seminars on thesubject. This

is the first portion of "a three—part’

retailing program. '
Toy Jobs Popular

Full-time supervisory positions
are held during the Christmas hol-
iday season. Each of five depart-
ment stores in the city and three
out—of-town receive members of
the class to work on the, busy
ﬂoors. The most popular depart-
ment seems to be that of toys. For
example, Stanley Goldman, Her-
bert Cook, Aldo Battistoli, Wil-
liam Shirley, Barbara Fasick,
Thaddeus Bastkowski, and Thom-
as Vivan are all employed in toys
at Kaufmann’s, Some are sales-
men while others are heads of
stock. -

“After the Christmas working
period, the class returns to school
until spring. At this time, they
take a trip to a world market
center such as New York and
spend a week “behind the scenes.”

There the class visits buying
offices, manufacturers, department
stores, and magazines. This trip
helps to emphasize the important
facts in each major part of the re-
tailing ﬁeld.

— Easter Brings More Jobs

The third selling part of the
program comes with the Easter
rush. This time, students are plac-
ed in jobs of their interest. In the
other work sessions, they were
given no choice. Before this period,
the studentsdecide exactly which
ﬁeld they want to enter.

This area of choice in the third
period enables the student to spe-
cialize in his chosen area. Those
interested in advertising work in
that department as copy writers
and production people. Such prac-
tical experience is extremely val-
uable. - .

With all of the working and
studying, the student receives a
salary. It is estimated by William
McCormick, director of admis-
sfons of the retailing school, that
the «students make just about
enough money to cover the tui-
tion for the year’s course.

When the third working period
has been completed, classes are
suspended for a week for sem-

inars.. During this time, personnel
people from all over the country
come to speak with the students.
This helps students decideiwhat

type of work they wish to go in-

to and at the same time, give em‘-

ployers a chance to look over the

people they may wish to hire. "
Placement 100 Per Cent

The Pitt School of Retailing is
considered the contact house for
all of its-former students at all
times. According to Miss Carrie
Huffman, assist’ant professor of ad-
vertising, the school is proud of
its 100 per cent placement rec-
ord. Most of the graduates do go
into’ the retailing field. However,
the school will help others to ﬁnd
positions in other types of w‘6rk.

The School of Retailing occu-

pies the 19th and 20th ﬂoors of V

the Cathedral. Most of the activ-
ity does center about the 19th be-
cause it houses the library,
lounge, classroom, and . office of‘
the clean. The classroom on the
20th floor is unique in that it may
be opened. into one giant lecture
hall or divided into three smaller
rooms. 9

The finest equipment in visual
aids is found in this grad school.
Ten persons comprise the staff and
throughout the year guest speak-
ers come, including magazine rep-
resentatives, public relations per-
sonnel, buyers, and merchandising
managers.

‘ Masters of Retailing

A degree of master of retailing
is earned after completion of the
10 month course. Only those stu-
dents who have"been granted an
A.B. or B.S. in liberal arts, busi-
ness administration or the like are‘
eligible for admission. They must
have a 1.5 cumulative average for

their ' undergraduate work. and
have previous retailing experi-
ence. V ‘

Pitt is privileged to be one of
only three universities in the
United States to offer a master‘s
degree in retailing. The other two
schools are New York university
and Washington university.

Of'the 42 students enrolled,
many are graduates of schools
other than Pitt. -Throughout the
10’*‘mon_th program, students have
a continual counselling program.
Their counsellors, staff members

of the school assist them in school,

and store matters.

All members of the School of
Retailing faculty have had prac-
ticed experience in the retailing
ﬁeld. Miss Huﬁman, for example,

Pitt's freshman cagers open their, basketball season
Saturday nightwhen they tangle with J ohnstown Center at
Johnstown. According to Coach Carl Peterson, “This is the
best-looking frosh team since Mickey Zernich and Don Viros-
tek were freshmen.” ‘

While scanning down the team roster the reasons be-
come very apparent. The team is chock-full of players who.
made all-state, all-WPIAL, etc., while in high school. The
team/'1Tnder the coaching of Peterson and Don Virostek, has
height galore. ‘

The average height of the start-
ing ﬁve is 6-4. John Laneve, a

starter, is the shortest man on the
squad, going an even six feet.

The starting ﬁve will be: Bob

This new fresh squad, with its
star-studded talent could go a long

way. As they gain experience and
the advantage of working together
as a tihit they may make their
presence felt and offer some good
games this winter.

How the Panthers fared against
these teams didn’t seem to matter
much with Timmons. The youthful
mentor remarked,. “Most teams we
play this year, while they are of
high standard, don’t match Du-

easier team like St. Francis, we
looked pretty good.”

Doc Enters His
Third Profession

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

 

It would not come as too much of a surprise if, at any one
of the home basketball games this year, the familiar ﬁgure of
Doc Carlson should come bouncing onto the Field House court
in pursuit of an erring referee.

, Although the erstwhile Panther tutor has given up the
coaching reins he held for so long, he will still be very much
a part of the hoop picture——this time as a telecaster.

He and Bob Prince, sports director of WENS, will air
five Pitt home games this year over channel 16, starting
with the Michigan contest tomorrow night. Prince, con-
trary to the opinions of his followers, insists that he will
allow Doc to do most of the talking. And it is quite possi-
ble that the genial doctor will accept the task thrust upon
him.

Doc has been practicing his new profession with the aid
of atape recorder during cage drills this season, in an effort to
pour only the purest of language into the mike.

* * * *

At Carlson’s gigantic testimonial dinner Wednesday
night, an ironic twist presented itself in that many of the of-
ﬁcials whom Doc had tormented in the past turned out to
honor him and still had to dig into their pockets for the fee.

Rosey Rowswcll, the main speaker, revealed that he
had been in a similar situation before. He said that he was
“removed” from school (for putting rubber overshoes in

’ the furnace) and years later was invited to return to

‘speak at one of the school affairs.

Playmaker Burch May
Turn Chief Pointmaker

By PAUL HARRISON
Adding to his usual reliable role of playmaker, Captain
Clar'ence “Dutch” Burch will accept a new job as one of
Pitt’s leading scoring threats this season.

_ Dutch, a 6-0, 185-pound seasoned9**
veteran, has ordinarily been a
.consistant “feeder” to his team-
~mates over the past two campaigns.
{In 1951-52 he was seventh in the
‘nation in assisting fellow hoop-
sters to gather markers with an
average of 6-1 per game. Last
season he again led the squad in
lsetting up his four companions.

Don’t get the idea the big Oil
City bucketeer didn’t get his share
of digits in his 55 varsity tilts, for
he has. In the 51-52 grind he
dumped 225 points into the mesh
lwhile last year he upped his out-
put to 271. As a frosh Dutch led
his team with a total of 115 tal-
lies in 9 contests.

Good Layup

Burch was appointed captain of
‘.his season’s varsity by Doc Carl-
<on last spring before the veteran
mentor turned the Panther basket-
‘iall reins over to the present
"oach, Bob Timmons.

Timmons considers the drive-in
layup shot and the one-hander
from halfway out as Dutch’s best
shots. The senior phys ed major
thinks of basketball as a year-
round sport, even though the
winter months have been officially
designated for cage competition.

Commenting on the upcoming
season, which_ will be initiated to-
morrow night at the Field House,

a chance. I believe we’re better
than most people think.”

days in Oil City. In his junior
year he was selected to the All-
State second team and the very
next year he captured a- berth on
the ﬁrst team in the All-Pennsyl-
vania schoolboy elections.

Basketball 1sn't his only love,
however, for he starredpin high

quarterbacked the frosh eleven un-

Actually he suffered a concussion

LIICKIES tun AGAIN

Last year a survey of leading colleges
throughout the country showed that
smokers in those colleges preferred
Luckiesito any other cigarette.

This year another nation-wide survey
—based on thousands of actual student
interviews, and representative of all
students in regularcolleges——shows that
Luckies lead again over all brands, regu-
lar or king size . . .and by a wide margin!
The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste better.

Smoking enjoyment is all a matter of
_t_a3t_<_e, and the fact of the matter is Luckies
taste better——for 2 reasons. L. S./ M.F.T.
-—Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. And
Luckies are made better to taste better.
So, Be Happy—-Go’ Lucky!
