Mrs. Roosevelt thought that
the real defense of America
lay “in better medical care for
our young children to make cer-

She advocated Adlai Stevenson's
platform of a. “New America”
which “seeks to better the life
of all our people.”
Pennsylvania’s Democratic can-

of Philadelphia, Mr. Joseph S.

IF Council Analyzes

MON., OCT. 22, 1956

Judicial Commission

The authority and function of the judicial commission
were analyzed at the Interfraternity Council meeting last
Wednesday, Oct. 17, at the Theta Chi house. President, Reed
Harper, Bus. Ad. ’57, began the meeting by making null and
void the changes in athletic rules approved by IF at their last
meeting. This was done as result of the decision of the judici-

ary commission concerning the9

appeal of Pi Lambda Phi that they
be allowed -to continue in IF foot-
ball competition.

The Pi Lams had utilized an
ineligible player in the latter part
of their ﬁrst IF game of the year
and under the rules temporarily
adopted by If‘, this disqualiﬁed
them from further competition.

Technical Forfeit

Under the amended rules, a
technical forfeit, such as allow-
ing an ineligible player to partj-
cipate, would have been penalized
merely by addition of one game
in the loss column, and the sub-
traction of one in the win column.
The modified rules were presented
and approved before IF, the eve-
ning of October 3. The disputed
game was played the same after-
noon.

Under which rules was the first
game of the competition played?
The judicial commission
that the modified athletic regu-
lations were put through under
improper procedure. Their de-
cision was a causual factor in
the nullification of the
which had been adopted,
Harper.

Larry Miller, Col. ’57, argued
at the meeting that the amend-

by

wsa. T. 

ment to athletic rules had been

adopted properly and appealed
the decision of the chair. The
vote was 11-7 against the chair
and the ruling was upheld, since
an appeal of this type makes a
two-thirds vote. Harper referred
the rules back to the board
managers.

Miller moved that IF Council
reaffirm the right to change,
modily, or amend any rules of
any one of its subsidiary bodies
at any time. He stated his reason
for making the motion is “to pro-
tect the interests of IF council
and to prevent a subsidiary or-
ganization from usurping power
in excess of its authority.”

Social life For All

In the midst of fraternity and sorority rushing, bidding,

. and pledging, a word or two should be added about. social
events open to all students—frat—bound or not. And there
are many such formal and informal dances, dinners, teas,
and parties already listed for the year. . . . . . . . . . . . .

Several all-school dances are coming up next month.
Homecoming night——November 17-will land with a formal
splash in the Commons Room when West Point Cadets are
paired with Pitt, Tech, and Chatham women—sorority and
non-sorority. (The proportion of non-Pitt women will be
less than 10% per school.)

Plans are being made through various student-faculty
committees to choose from women who sign up to be blind
dates for the cadets. Couples will be paired on the basis
of age, height, race, and religion. In addition to cadets and
their dates, approximately one hundred tickets will be given
out free to the first Pitt students who request them.

In an informal capacity, a Beaux Arts program is plan-
ned and invites all students to “Pitt 1956 vs. Pitt 1984,” a
dance-play-speech event on November 15 from 2:30 to 4:30
p.m. in the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Freshman women have specially planned socials, though
others are welcome, through such events as this Wednesday
night’s Women’s Recreation Association party in the Field
House. Panhellenic sing and reception on Friday night is
planned for frosh women, too.

Freshman men and women will hold a series of social
events including dancing, games, and refreshments on the
twelfth floor.’ This is being plannedby committees of WSGA
and men's c'onference groups. Invitations to frosh will be
sent out.

00000

And, of course, Pitt Players draws crowds not only of.

Greeks and independents, but “non-Pittites,” and even “non-
college goers.”

Climaxing the all-university social events this term will
be a Christmas Commons Room Ball. Even those who don’t
attend will see the‘ huge lit evergreens all season long in
the tri-ﬂoor room; and they’ll shuffle on that room’s shiny
ﬂoor polished just for the night of Friday, December 14.

Hearts will Hop, be they under pins or not, at this
annual dance on February 15 in 1957. vMen and women are
invited to ask dates, though the Women’s classes will do
the planning.

All this is to say nothing of class events, foreign stu-
dents’ and campus religious groups’ events.

Who said there are no social opportunities out of
Greece? ‘ .

Politicallssues Debatecl ,

the 1956 Presidential race. Democratic views will be written by

The GOP Additions

By Harold Jacobs

The starting point for a discussion of President
Eisenhower’s four years in the White House might
well be the 1952 battle cry of the Democratic Party,
“Don’t let ’em take it away!”

This power-packed political quip, which for a
short spell echoed throughout every corner of
America, seems to have resulted in boomerang.
The proper question to be an-
swered, four years hence, is:
What have they actually taken
away? The fellowing evaluation
of basic Republican positions is
intended to stir some thoughts on
this question. 1

We have heard a great deal
in the present campaign about
the ‘twins,” peace and prosperi-
ty. At ﬁrst observation these

words might be-passed off as just another ﬂower-
ing of political oratory; however, a deeper prob-
ing, which requires going far beyond the mere
words themselves, reveals facts that are quite
relevant. '

Peace or Prosperity

For the greater part of the last half—century,
the United States has gone through cycles of
peace or prosperity. The“ 1920’s gave us peace, but
the balance existing between labor and manage-
ment was essentially one-sided, and forces that
were to culminate in the -1929 depression were
germinating, -hardly indicators of genuine pros-
perity.

Peace continued throughout the 1930's, but the
country was suffering the woes of depression. In

‘ the 1940’s prosperity held sway, but this was based

largey on the stepped—up war economy.

Now, for the ﬁrst time we are abe to per-
ceive at cast a gimmer of the ultimate goal-
peace couped with prosperity. -

Some may content that this was meant to be, but
fatalism is hardly an objective method for ex-
planiing the intricate movements of history. Oth-
ers assert that the “ideal” peace is still not at hand
since the Cold War clouds the picture. This fact
cannot be denied. However, all-out wars that may
have developed at “hot spots” such as 'Indo—China
and the Suez Canal have been averted. Particularly
notable has been Secretary of State Dulles’ inﬂu-
ence in quieting Great Britain, France, and Egypt
during the ﬁrst critical weeks of the Suez dispute.
There is still much to be gained in realizing a
more secure combination of peace and prosperity,
but steps in the right direction are evident.~ The
distinguishing mark of Ike’s New Republicanism

‘may rest with the greater fulﬁllment of this goal.

Government. Not Business ,

The Republican position concernihg centraliza-
tion of government appears to be covered in the
thesis that the business of government is govern-
ment, not business. Projects that might be tackled
by private enterprise should best remain in that
realm, for (1) it is unwise to compete with private
venturers, (2) federal, state, and local treasuries
beneﬁt from taxes received from their proﬁts, and
(3) individual enterprises are more prone to take

necessary risks and provide eﬁicient management.»

The choice might be narrowed down to whether it
is better to have one central planner doing your
planning, or to have many enterpreneurs each exer-
cising his ingenuity in the traditional spirit of
competition.

The entrance of government into matters of
public welfare is generally recognized, but with
proper restraint. Fderal action, taken in areas in
which the states appear inadequate, has resulted in
the extension of ‘Social Security, a. particularly
successful feature of New Deal legislation, a federal
road building program, and, in the near future, a
giant school construction project. No attempt is
herein made to ignore or minimize the role that
Democrats have played in these endeavors; both
parties may claim rather equal credit.

Tidelands Oil Controversy

Much criticism has been leveled against the
Republicans for granting of the Tidelands Oil to
the states. Political play has been made in terms
of a “giveaway” by the people. The fact, however,
is that the Tidelands represented a transfer by the
people (as federal government) to the people (as
state government). Furthermore, the federal gov-
ernment stands to proﬁt by a new source of tax
revenues and by thousands of workers who are
'ven, , employment in the edeveelopnaent

Eisenhower -- A Leader?
By Irv Rothman

A neighbor of mine, an elderly gentleman with
a storehouse of reminiscences stated the other day

that he well-remembered “the McKinley Adminis- V

tration when Mark Hannah was President and

the Harding administration when ‘St. Clair’ ran, _

the country.” .. _

He is voting Democratic in the 1956 elections
because he feels the Presidential W,
incumbent is as little a national - -
leader and as much controlled
by singular interests’ as were 2*.

these two other Republican
Presidents.
_lnterest at Heart

President Eisenhower has

surrounded himself with Cabi-
net oﬁicials who have their ,
singular interests at heart; and -
because he has been unable to serve the country
on several occasions, the President has turned over
much of his own policy-making powers to these‘?
men who are leading the country. 2

He has a Secretary of Defense whose former
employer has far outdistanced any other corpora-
tion in receiving government defense contracts; a
Secretary of Agriculture who cannot realize the
plight of the family farmer, because he, himself,

served as a major executive of a large farm co- /

operative; a secretary of Labor who will not con-
sider Taft-Hartley amendmehts, because it was for
that very reason a pro—labor man left that office.

A Secretary of the Air Force who inﬂuenced ‘

contracts by using government stationery; a See-
retary of Health, Education, and Welfare so inept
as to create a year set-back of the Salk Polio vac-
cine progress in the United States. “-

\

Tribute to inexperience

Lest we attribute this ‘unfortunate selection
to Mr. Eisenhower's judgment, we must realize'that
when he entered the political ring, he was far less
politically-experienced than a Mr. Stevenson was
when he ran for Governor of Illinois. We will not,
deny, however, that he was an experienced general

who served faithfully, the policy of the Roosevelt 1

and Truman administrations. ‘
But whether Ike) has accepted or rejected the
advice of his cabinet, the result in eithercase has ’
been weak leadership on the domestic and foreign
scenes. I ’ _  -‘
The Geneva “smi1e’,’ has proven worthless as'
foreign policy. In the arena of International rela-

tions, Mr. Eisenhower has failed to learn from there‘

valuable lesson that we must not be “wishy-washy”"
in deaing with out opposition.

Concrete Program

The President’s most concrete program for as-
suring world-wide peace has been an "‘open-Skies”
program to photograph critical areas of foreign
countries for security purposes. Any other strategy
has-been as obscure and short-sighted. :

The epitomy of international leadership has
been the action of this government in the Suez
Crisis-—we authorized France‘ and England to with-
draw pilots from the Canal, then refused to sup-
port military action while we formed an Inter-
national Association which has only recently been
repudiated by” the United Nations. '

This is not leadership. It’s as foolish business’?
as the President’s domestic policy which side
tracked legislative consideration of federal aid to
education until an election year. And when the
legislation was being debated, Ike could not guide
it foaghe was recuperating from an operation.

We cannot attribute to President, Eisenhower _

complete failure of this government to provide

necessary leadership; certainly his cabinet must
command the‘ larger share of the burden. But we
must realize that to re-elect the incumbent would
be to risk putting his Cabinet back into power.

In any case, we agree with the lisping politi-
cian who claimed that Ike’s biggest asset is the
Eisenhower “Mrs.” ‘

lands. An additional point of interest is that the
right of the states to the offshore areas had been
substantiated in 30 rulings of the federal govern-
ment’s own Department of Interior, 244 rulings 9,»;

various federal and state courts, and 53 decisions\"”‘

of the Supreme Court of the United States.
We return to our original point of departure.
Has anything been taken away? No. Only addi-

IF Debates

the judiciary commission twenty
school days after it is committed
instead of ﬁve school days after
its discovery. Council was gen-
erally in favor of this proposal.

The reasons offered for the
change were clear and well-
deﬁned. Five school days is not
sufficient time for an individual
or group who discovers an in-
fraction to check carefully as to
its validity and ﬁle the ﬁndings
with the commission. Lancaster
presented, by way of example,
the case of the report of an il-
legal rushing affair too late for
any action to be taken. The
motion was carried. ‘

Lynn Watson, Col. ’57, present-
ed a motion to council stating that
any group or individual ﬁling a
complaint wouldforfeit‘ to IF a
deposit of $25, should their com-
plaint prove to be unwarranted.

Protests Made’

Bob McCabe, Col. ’57, member
of the judiciary commission, was
vehement in protesting against
the proposal on the grounds that
it was not in good taste and
would do away with all the long
months of careful planning for
establishment of this commission.
A $25 deposit, McCabe felt, would
discourage groups from ﬁling
complaints.

Watson defended his motion by
asserting that a “smear-cam-
paign” was leveled against Delta
Tau Delta as a resultpof a com-
plaint ﬁled against the fraternity
by word of mouth with the judi-
ciary commission. No proof nor
evidence of any kind was produc-
ed to back up the, accusation.
Other fraternities capitalized on
this unfortunate happening,
claiming ’to rushees that Delta
Tau Delta would within the week
be on social probation and would
not be permitted to pledge any-
one. r A 1

case fall through against the de-
fendant. This analogy, Watson
claimed, could be aptly applied
to lodging a complaint with the
judiciary commission.

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57, discussed
the motion from a moralistic
standpoint, claiming that a con-
dition of mutual trust and respect
should exist among the fraterni-
ties and such harsh precautionary
measures are unnecessary. “Don’t
lose sight of _why we’re dabbling

lations must be learned early. The
motion was defeated.

MARKING ON THE CURVE...
AND WHAT TO_DO ABOUT IT

Twonkey Crimscott was a professor. Choate Sigafoos
was a sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold,
brilliant. Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal.

Twonkey Crimscott believed in diligence, discipline, and p

marking on the curve. Choate Sigafoos believed in elves,
Jayne Mansﬁeld, and thirteen hours sleep each night.

Yet there came a timewhen Twonkey Crimscott-'-
mentor, sage, and savant -— was thoroughly out-thought,
out-foxed, out-maneuvered, out—ployed, and out—witted
by Choate Sigafoos, sophomore.

It happened one day when Choate was at the library
studying for one of Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology.
Mr. Crimscott’s exams were murder —- plain, ﬂat murder.
Th.ey“consisted of one hundred questions, each question
having four possible answers—A, B, C, and D. The trouble
was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so in-
tricately worded, that students more clever by far than
Choate? Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.

So on this day Choate sat in the library poring over
his sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concen-
tration, while all around him sat the other members of
the sociology class, every one studying like crazy. “What
a waste!” he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this
bounce, chained to musty books in a musty library! We
should be out singing and dancing and smooching and
cutting didoes on the greenswardl” I

Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit

Choate. “Listen!” he shouted to his classmates. “Tomor-

row when we take the exam, let’s all — every one of us -
check Choice ‘A’ on every question —— every one of them.”

“Huh?” said his classmates. ,

“Mr. Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check
the same. answers, then we all get the same score, and
everybody in the class gets a ‘C’.”

“Hmm,” said his classmates. ,

“Let's. get out of here and have a ball!” said Choate.

So they all ran out and lit Philip Morrises and had
a ball, as, indeed, you will too when you light a Philip
Morris, for if there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit
and gladden the heart, it is today's new Philip Morris-
ﬁrm and pure and fragrant and ﬁlled with true, natural,
golden tobacco, lip end to tip end.

    

‘L.  ‘ ff 1’, .; 5&5‘,  

Well sir, the next morning the whole class did what
Choate said and, sure enough, they all got “C's,” and they
picked Choate up and carried him on their shoulders and
sang “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” and plied him with
sweetmeats and Philip Morris and girls and put on
buttons which said “I DOTE ON CHOATE.”

But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next
time shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he gave
them only one question——to wit: Write a 30,000 word
essay on “Cr1me Does Not Pay.”

“lfou and your ideas,” they said to Choate and tore
off his epaulets and broke hissword and drummed him
out of the school. Today, a broken man, he earns a meager
living as a camshaft in Toledo.

Panthers ‘Bowl’ Duke, 27-14~

Salvaterra Stars
In Oyster Bowl;
Offense Explodes

By ED KOLTISKA

_An explosion set off by the
Panthers in the second quar-
ter smothered the Duke Blue
Devils of Durham, North
Carolina, 27-14, Saturday.

The tenth annual Oyster
Bowl classic at Norfolk, Virginia,
was ﬁlled to capacity as 28,000
fans witnessed the Oaklanders re-
bound from their loss to Cali-

fornia.
The spurt was lighted in the

opening minutes of the game
when halfback . Bernie Blaney
took Bugs Bagamery’s kickoff

and scampered 97 yards through
the middle of the Blue and Gold
for the touchdown. Buddy Bass,
Duke’ captain, converted to put
the Southerners ahead, '7-0.
Salvaterra Sparks TD

With the Oaklanders starting to
burn at this stage, Corny Salva-
terra opened the second quarter
with a keep over right tackle for
seven yards and a score.

On the kickoff by Bagamery,
‘quarterback Bob Brodhead mis-
judged the ball and was down-
ed on the six-yard line. In three
plays Brodhead could only move
the ball to the seven before
punting ,.to the Duke 45 where
Salvaterra ran it back to the
Blue Devil 28.

Salvaterra hit Joe Walton on
the next play with a 24-yard pass
and a touchdown. Lewis booted
the extra point and the Jungle
Cats forged ahead, 14-7.

Line Play Stops Duke

In the following sequence of
plays, the Panther forward wall
kept the Duke ball carriers hem-
med in, allowing only ﬁve yards
on three plays. This made the
Blue Devils kick.

Corky Cost returned the punt ,
ten yards before being downed
on the Panther 43-yard line.
Lewis then crossed‘ the Duke‘
defense with a 12-yard aerial
Walton who outran the de-
fenders for 46 yards and his
second touchdown of the con-
test. The margin remained at
20-7 when Lewis’ conversion at-
tempt went wide.

Tackle Sid

Oaklanders came with only 20

seconds remaining in the tilt
when halfback Ray DiPasqua1e
skirted around left tackle to make
it 26-14. A high pass from center
forced Salvaterra to circle right
end for the extra point and the

27-14 victory. ‘

Wide Open Football
Perhaps Coach John Michelosen
let his gridders play a little more
open style of football than they

did in the previous games as the

passing attack gained 117 yards
to none for Duke. The forward

wall limited the Carolinians to

168 yards while the Panther backs
were picking up 244 yards rush-

mg.

After the game Vince Scor-
sone said, “No, the quick score
didn’t demoralize us. Instead, it
made us ﬁght just that much
harder,” ,

Bill Murray, Duke coach, stat-
ed, “The Panthers have a very
strong team, They played very
well and beat us good.”

Athletic Director «Tom Hamil- .

ton was‘ also impressed by the
Panther win. Hamilton said, “This
was -the best performance of the
season and a ﬁne victory. The
team is picking up momentum as
the season progresses.”-

B! BUNNY RABBITS

In their ﬁrst home game of the
season, the Women’s hockey team
defeated Carnegie Tech 4-1, in a
fast-moving contest last Thurs-
day afternoon on the Cathedral
lawn. '

Pitt got off to a fast lead in the
first few minutes of the game
when Kathy Gianoutsos, center
forward, drove the ball into the
goal after receiving a long pass.
from Karly Kumer at right wing.

A second goal soon was scor-
ed by Irene Brodak, right inner,
on a long drive from the strik-
ing circle. Before the half ended.
the Panther coeds scored an-
other goal; Gianoutsos again
making the initial drive into the
goal cage.

The second half found Pitt in
control of the ball most of the
time. Spurred on by senior half-
backs Lois Moogerman and Jan
McConnell, Pitt was able to hold
onto the ball for most of the game‘
to gain the win.

While thousands of loyal fans sat around their radios
listening to a sometimes brilliant, sometimes unimpressive
Panther varsity defeat Duke 500 miles away, right under
their noses in the Stadium, perhaps the hardest fought game

of the season was going on.

Only about 400 spectators were on hand, though, to see
the Penn State frosh nip the Panther frosh, 7-0, ‘Saturday.
But not one of the 400 was sorry he came as the game
developed into a bruising, jarring stalemate with the play

centered around the 50-yard line:

for most of the contest. ‘
State Scores Only TD

Penn State scored the second
time it got its hands on the ball.
From midﬁeld quarterback Dick
Lucas of Glasport hit Ed Caye of
Oliver with a 29-yard pass and
Caye raced to the 12.

Wilkinsburg’s Joe Y o u n g 0
carried in two plays to the three.
Caye picked up a first down on
the two. Another buck advanc-
ed the pigskin to the one, and
Lucas tallied on a quarterback
sneak.

The locals dominated the re-
mainder of the ﬁrst half, but
could not get a sustained drive
going. Halfback Jimmy Cox flip-
ped a 30-yard aerial to Bob Rathi,
center playing end, to carry to the
Lion Cub 45-yard marker, but the
Panthers could not move from
there and,lost the ball on downs.

Cox Stops Lion Threat

The second half, by compari-
son was a little sloppily played.
Both teams fumbled rather fre-
quently, halting any possible
drives. The ball changed hands
four times in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes

of . the second half with tackle
Larry Burke grabbing both Penn
State fumbles. The only real Nit-
tany Lion threat was broken up
by Cox as he intercepted a Lucas
aerial on the Panther 20-yard
line. ‘

The Panthers were hard hit by
injuries with tackles Ernie West-
wood and center Seraﬁno Fazio

ills, halfbacks Don Niles and

Andy Sepsihad their legs banged. ,

up and Steve Valesky injured his "H

hip.

Bill Marks, former Alderdice
star, took over the quarterback
spot and ran the team well the
rest of the game.

Guard Bob Longfellow remain-
ed in the tilt despite a sore
shoulder and partner Al Corﬁeld
returned to play the second half
after receiving a bad gash over
his eye in the ﬁrst quarter.

As in the loss to West Virginia,
the bright spot in the Panther
Cub’s performance was the slick
running of the backﬁeld and the
steadiness of the defensive‘ for-

Panther Offense ;_
Causes Optimism ..

Any thoughts that the Panther offense lacked color or
imagination were dispelled with the 27-14 win over Duke
- Saturday. Coach John Michelosen’s gridders—Corny Salva-

terra in particular—-unleashed the most potent and surprising.

Panther offense of the young campaign, much to the amaze-
ment and bewilderment of the unsuspecting Blue Devils.

After three games of straight football, Coach Michelosen opened
the doors and injected excitement intothe Blue and Gold offense;
-something which is usually divorced from Pitt football patterns. And
if the Duke game is going to determine the locals’ fortunes this
season like it did in ’55, all we can say is the Panthers are on

their way.

The thing chieﬂy responsible for this happy situation is
a coache’s faith in his quarterback. Coach~Michelosen maintained
all along that his first signal-caller was Salvaterra. Many tried
to persuade him otherwise and offered many reasons why he was
wrong. However, John wouldn’t be swayed. "Salvaterra has the
potential to be a great quarterback,” said Michelosen several
weeks back. He maintained the same thing after the Duke game.
In fact, the Duke tilt could do nothing but solidify his belief.
It seems as Salvaterra goes, so goes the Panthers.

Salvaterra should greatly inspire the team in the remaining
games. One particular play in the Duke contest that was really a beau-
,,,// tiful thing to watch was when the locals were trying for av—first down
‘ inside the Duke ten-yard line. It was fourth down and short yardage
to go when Salvaterra rolled to his left and hit Corky Cost with a
touchdown pass that happened before the opposition knew whereithe

ball was.
impressive.

Unfortunatey, a penalty nulliﬁed the play, but it looked

After the game Michelosien praised the whole team for a great

effort in downing Duke.

“The whole team looked good,” offered

John. When querried whether or not Salvaterra played as good a
ball game against Duke as Neff did last year, Michelosen nodded in

agreement.

Except for two plays when Bernie Blaney ran the opening
kickoff back 97 yards and Ed Rushton intercepted astray pitch-
back in mid air and raced for another touchdown, Duke was
actually never in the game. The Blue and Gold far outclassed
them, but these two plays kept them in the game, and when the
Blue Devils threatened to get a sustained drive underway late
in the second half, things looked had until the Panthers ﬁnally
pushed over the clincher with less than a minute to go in the

game.

When querried’ if he thought the Panthers were a far more
superior team than Duke ‘except for the two Duke scoring plays,
Michelosen said, “The score shouldn’t have been as close as it was.”

Harriers EdgeiHoyas, 23-33,,
With Timon Sparking Victory

By MICHAEL’ GERBER 1‘ . »

Coach Carl Olson’s cross—country team continued unde-
”iJ/feated on Saturday as they took the measure of the George-
town Hoyas, 23-33. The meet was to have been a triangular,
but American University, the other team which had planned

to compete, was unable to ﬁeld ab

full team and had to withdraw.
The victory, was the fourth
straight for the all-winning
Panthers. »

Vince Timon once again proved
to be the class of the Panthers as
he romped home ﬁrst, covering
the four mile
course in the
nation’s capital
in 19 minutes
and 51 seconds.

Weightliﬁing Club
Seeking Members

Leo Bemis, Director of Intra-

a weightlifting club could be
startedgin the near future at Sky-

“Last year a club was organized
but interest ran low and it broke
up, but many students have ask-
ed about reviving the sport,”
stated Bemis.

Further optimism stems from
the fact that many freshman
boys listed weightlifting among
their interests when they ﬁlled
out their athletic interest cards.

The members of last year’s club
are still in school and Bemis
would like them to contact him
if they are still interested.

Bemis, varsity soccer coach,
wants any boy interested in
weightlifting and body—bui1ding
to contact him at the Memorial
Field House immediately.

If enough students show up,
there is high hopes that the sport
will be revived. The school will

essary facilities.

A goal of $3500 has been set

carried on in fullest force during
