M Registration Figures Up

Rankin Notes Increase of Roughly One

Thousand Students Yearly Since 1961. .

According to Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice chancellor of
student and general affairs, the overall registration rate for
the University has showed a strong upward climb. With a
total ‘of 15,532 students ‘enrolled in. the University, the

statistics have increased at roughly 1000 students per

State NAACP -
Head Explains
Group’s Action

The National Association
for the Advancement of Color-

established group which has‘
been fighting ‘cases for many
years in ‘many areas and not
a recent development, according
to Henry Smith, state president
of NAACP. V

. Speaking at the University
NAACP chapter meeting last
Thursday, Smith explained many

of the cases the group has par- ’

ticipated in and has brought to
the Supreme Court. “It _is a slow
and tedious method [going through
the courts] but it is one that has
permanent results.” ‘

Smith went on to explain that
many things around the Univer-
sity need to be changed. “The cli-
mate is now right. Challenge him
[Chancellor Litchﬁeld] and see
that he puts into effect what he
said he would,” he said.

In other business, the group.
invited Sta'n‘Stein, associate edi-
tor of The Pitt News to speak to
them about his column “Not
Guilty.”-— Stein, answered questions
asked of him by various NAACP
members and explained his stand
on the matter.

Elections of officers ‘for the
current year was also held at
the meeting. Ralph Proctor was
elected president, Cecelia
Champ, ﬁrst vice president;
Jim Syphers, second vice presi-
dent; Gail Brown, recording
secretary; Judy Rosenthal, cor-
responding secretary, and Ro-
bert Herning, treasurer.

The public accommodations
committee reminded the members
that any student having trouble
gettingoff campus housing due to
discrimination should contact the
committee. - ’

Midday to Peature
Parkinson For
Noon Wednesday

Work expands to meet the
time and personnel available for
its completion. So says Profes-
sor C. Northcote Parkinson who
will speak on this subject, which
he calls Parkinson’s Law, in the
Student Union ballroom on Wed-
nesday at noon.

Parkinson also explores such
topics as the cocktail party meth-

vidual corporate climbing by such
methods as marrying the boss's
daughter, and the rising ‘of ex-
penses to meet and surpass in-
come. He has become well known
for his humorous treatments of

°since 1961. ’ ‘

year

Dr. Rankin ‘ pointed out that
though a limited" glance at the
registration breakdown w o u l (1
show some “internal fluctuations,”
theiclimb in enrollment ' is con-
sistent over the past ten years. An
example of ,how statistics can be
made to “prove anything,” is.-what
appears to be a downward trend
in'the school of business enroll-
ment, which shows a steady de-
cline from 410 students to a pres-
ent 195. , _ '

The fact that this decline has
taken place over the ‘past two
"years is well explained however.
“The school of business is being
phased out of the‘University,” Dr.
Rankin explained. .He added that
within the next year or two this
school .will have been dropped,
“phased out,” by the institution.

Enrollment In_creases ‘ __

But even the internal break-
down of registration shows”num-
erous upward trends in enroll-
ment. The statistics for the grad-
uate and professional schools
alone have climbed from A‘ about
4000 to over 5000 students over the
same period of time.

Dr. Rankin pointed, to two.
other especially promising facts
drawn» from the enrollment re-
port. Citing that the freshman
class has climbed 1000 to over
ll00 students, he noted that this
was .“promising because the
number ofihigh school graduates
in Pennsylvania this past year
was less than in quite a few
years.” ,

In support of the view that the
University
standards for the sake of boosting
enrollment, Dr. Rankin said that
“62 per-cent of the present fresh-'
man class were in the upper
quintile of their graduating class.”

Oak-Corp Victim of Misunderstanding?

General Dahl Blasts  
      in
Remarks of Meet g P
' ' By PAT POLLINO ,_ ~
General Leo P. Dahl, executive vice president of Oakland
Corporation, has denounced allegations made at the “Citizens
Committee to Save Oakland from the Ravages of Redevelop-
ment” meeting Monday as “friction developing from a lack
of information and the self-serving interests of people Who
stand to lose or gain (in redevelopment).” _ ‘A
V ‘The retired Air Force major generalsaid the reasons _
behind such abuse are “misunderstanding and misinforma--I
tion. _We in effect, are being confused with" the_Urban Ref-gr
development Authority (URA) and/or the University of
Pittsburgh. ’ ‘
- “No Authority . . . as Such” "
“weihave no authority or power to redevelop Oakland, . -
as such. But we have an‘invest_ment(s) to look out for —- -
i.e., what we must try" to do is develop an environment com-
patible with the long-term in.terests ‘of institutions repre- -
sented in Oak-Corp.” ' .
_He explained that “redevelopment, as such”
simply means that the URA is solely empowered to
single out an area as “blighted.” Investments, or in-
stitutions, mentioned by General Dahl as constituents
of Oak-Corp are the University, Carnegie Institute Of
Technology, Carnegie Institute, the Catholic Institute
’of Pittsburgh, Mellon Institute and Mount Mercy

; " ’ By NANCY DELANEY

* Mass democracy and rapid
ichange present a real chal-
;lenge' to the development of
“ ‘high cultural standards in
America ,t o d a‘ y, postulated
j_August«_ Hecksher,_ former art
,_advisor to President Kennedy, at
Midday Series last Wednesday.

‘Throughout the ‘ages, Heck-
sher explained, it has not been
'7th'e_- democratic spirit that has cre-
ated art. The idea of bringing a
_ fhigh level of art to a great num-
ber of people is “radically new”
—— but then, in 1775‘ so was the
‘idea «of bringing ' political freedom
fto a_whole (population. “It is
possible.”

 He did not,
how..

The second challenge arises be-
cause the modern day artist’s
blinding'liberation and his need
for constant adjustment to chang-
ing society retards cultural re-
ﬁnement. .However, Hecksher is
*“not necessarily pessimis-
tic”, about this for he views the
‘modern artist as a “prophet who
sees through the outer forms of

however, indicate

:?life and sees truths in new
shapes.”

»shapes?” One may question his

‘As compared to the bounded-

ciﬁc locations of the past, we to-

formless and disorganized.”
Places have ceased to exist. “A
place should have its_ own smell,
its own time, its own rhythm.”
But rapidity and homogenity,
hurry and noise, have destroyed
this distinction. _. «—

ly, suifers by being copied,- re-

consumer - society m o r a 1 i t y
treats art as a commodity, con-c
suming it like all other “goods
and gadgets.” The artist is
often “used up” in turning out a,
constant ﬂow.

Hecksher did not explain, how-
ever, how “it is possible” to bring
culture to_the masses without re-
producing or else demanding that
the artist turn out a constant
ﬂow. _ '

A Everything’s Not Beautiful

In fact,_ the only solution (or
rationalization) _’he did offer to
the problems he posed was ‘that
everything cannot be beautiful.

If we seek beauty alone‘, we
may miss the roots that ‘make
society real. Ugliness may be
a fringe disorder of a city alive
and dynamic.

Perhaps he hoped that we
would infer from this that every
speech cannot be conclusive. If
we seek conclusions alone, we
may miss the roots’ that make
our optimism real. Indecisiveness
may be only a fringe disorder of
a speaker who»is really alive and
dynamic underneath it all.

‘He invites anyone who is inter-

‘The committee’s function ini-
tially will be to inform the in-
terested people on the present

rposition of the University with

the city of Pittsburgh on city
permission to make improvement
in the campus ‘area. ~

Litchﬁeld was told by Dr.

Alan‘ C. Rankin of Student Af-
fairs at the coffee hour that
curb-shaving for wheelchair
students was outlawed by the
city in the name of “pedestrian
safety.” Litchﬁeld’s answer was
emphatic in advising the Uni-
versity community “nototo give
up” on the problem.

Two difﬁculties arise for the
University in this area. One is
that in several cases, the juris-
diction for making» improvements
lies with the city and not with
the University.

Another problem is the lack of
funds for improvements. .Heller
commented that the many peo-
ple underwrite charitable func-
tions and construction of new
buildings but few donate toward
a “non-prestige” item like widen-
ing doorways or shaving ‘curbs.

Wipe Out Ghettos Evdngelizes  i

Former Pa. Gov. Lawrence

The “higher motivation —— to do
what is right should spur
America to wipe out it ghettos,”
evangelized former Pennsylvania
governor David L. Lawrence.

In an address to the Women’s
Association of the University

A(WAUP) last Tuesday, the former

mayor of Pittsburgh and present
chairman of President Kennedy’s
Committee on Equal Opportunity
in Housing (CEOH) lamented that
the challenge of equal rights has
too long been ignored and decried
that emotions are now transcend-
ing reason.

A calm and positive approach,
such as the emergence at last of
uniﬁed national policy, therefore,

transcends guilt and anger. It is '

“like a beacon piercing the fog,”
he lauded. ' -

A second positive step is the
CEOH’s planned project to dispel
the myth that there is catastrophic
decline of property _values when a
Negro family moves into an all-
white neighborhood. —

Odds Four to One

The odds are four to one that '

property will retain its value if

He found it at western Electric

T. R. Thomsen,_B.S.M.E., University of Nebraska,
'58, came to Western Electric for several reasons.
Important to him was the fact that our young engi-
neers play vital roles right from the start, working
on exciting engineering projects in communica-
tions. including: electronic switching, thin film cir-
cuitry, microwave systems and optical masers.

Western E|ectric's wide variety of challenging
-assignments appealed to Tom, as did the idea of
advanced study through full-time graduate engi-
neering training, numerous management courses
and a company—paid Tuition Refund Plan.

Tom knows, too, that we'll need thousands of
experienced engineers for supervisory positions
within the next few years. And he's getting the
solid experience necessary to qualify. Right now,
Tom is developing new and improved inspection

and process control techniques to reduce manu-‘
facturing costs of telephone switching equipment.
Tom is sure that Western Electric is the right place
for him. What about you?

If you set the highest standards for yourself,
enjoy a challenge, and have the qualifications
we're looking_for—we want to talk to you! Oppor-
tunities for fast-moving careers exist now for elec-
trical, mechanical and industrial engineers, and
also for physical science, liberal arts and business
majors. For more detailed information, get your

Student. Critics

 Every year, in’ a thousand different rooms in the
 ‘ dormatories and in a thousand diﬁerent houses throughout"
the city, students sit down with their roommates, friends,
3 _or parents and complain about the terrible teachers they
.i’have been. struck with in one required‘ course or another
7here at the University. 4
They complain about speciﬁc

 

teachers, but they also

 

much—ridiculed distribution program. .

From what we have seen, most of this criticism is
well-directed. It is not mere dissatisfaction with aprofessor
who grades hard or with one who requires a 40 page term
paper. They are complaints about methods of teaching, the

U quality of the lecturer, the selection of material -for study,
or any of a number of other accademic problems.
I What it amounts to is that'the students feel that they
are being cheated out of their tuition because they are not
. ‘really learning anything. And who would feel this way
‘more than the student who is forced to sit through three
' grueling hours of class a. week in a course which he knows
is doing nothing to further his comprehension of a subject.
Contrary to popular opinion is most academic circles,
students are excellent evaluators of teachers and courses,
;., and their criticisms can be believed and acted upon with
' P reasonable security. i
, But all this valid criticism will never mean a thing if
it is not placed in the proper hands.‘ A newly organized
Liberal Arts Cabinet is attempting to do something about
this communication gap between the student critic and the
proper authority, in this case Dean Albert -Martin of’ the
School of Liberal Arts. -
The group’s’job will be to receive complaints from
students concerning courses, teachers, and programs and to
‘‘ forward these to Dean Martin. Although the Cabinet has
‘no real power to effect any changes ‘if they are needed, Dean
Martin has pledged his support and cooperation. . 9

So, those of you who have complaints now, have an op-
portunity to tell them to someone who will not only. listen,
but will also try to have them corrected. Take advantage of
your big chance. ' - - -

Profumo and Politics

By Larry Bernfield

The'British’ people will most likely face a
major election yearly in 1964. In view of the
recent Profumo scandal more and more Ameri-
cans are looking towards future political develop-
ments in Great Britain, if only
_to see who gets exposed next

Americana has crept into
British politicking, and the per-
sonality of the party leader will
certainly play an importl nt role
in the election of a new British
Government. Naturally a lead-
ers chosen subordinates are as"
reﬂection on himself, and‘Johnv
Profumo’s indiscretions might

 

well have’ a telling affection theisuccess of the"

Conservative party in the upcoming vote count-
ing. ” i '
The publication of Lord Denning’s Report, pres-
ently a British best-seller, however, has'taken
some of the force out of Labour’s hay-burning
over the Profumoi affair. In his three month in-
vestigation,. Denning conﬁrmed that " there had

been no security leak to Christine Keeler’s “second

man”, Soviet Naval Attache’ Evgeny Ivanov.
Conservatives Hurting .

Though Denning’s report has softened the ac-
cusations, conservatives will still be hurting when

..the time comes for the party to choose a man

that will represent them in the public eye as party
leader, future head of Parliament, head of cabinet
and naturally, Prime Minister. '
_If the election cannot be decided wholly on
the basis of personality, the partieswill have to

the really “burning” issues just aren’t there. It
was an entirely diﬁerent story in 1945, when
Labour came into power on a platform that was

distinctive and entirely an economic necessity --

the replacement of Britain’s war—shattered econ-
omy with the welfare state. Some basic industries
were nationalized, the National Health insurance
plan was put -into operation, and the British

 

. only, _,

people ‘saw. the beginnings of their promised se-
curity “from cradle to grave.”

By 1959, however, when the Conservatives re-
turned~to oﬁice for the third time since World
War II ended, a thin line —- the increase of old
age pensions — separated the basic platform of
the Labour party from that of the Conservatives.
Close to ﬁve years have passed now and Labour
has not been able to dig a, new and vital issue
out of the already accepted and well-functioning
British Welfare State.

In searching for a platform in the forthcoming
election, Labour might emphasize the issue of
education. British youth presently take a test at
the age of ten which determines whether they
continue with their academic education or enter a
school that teaches manual or secretarial skills.
Labour, feelingithat this ancient systetn is out-
moded can stress the acceptance of a comprehen-
sive school system such as the one found in the
United States, ~

Great Britain’s possible entry into the Eur-.
opean Economic Community is another area for

debate. On this issue, however Labour maintains

the more conservative stand of the two, favoring
retaining Commonwealth ties. The Conservatives
will carry the placard asking for British entry

. into the Common'Market, if anyone does.

Another "factor which cannot be discounted in
next year’s election is the nuisance potential of
Britain’s growing Liberal - party. The Liberals
have more than doubled their percentage -of the
popular vote over the last two national elections.
In a tight campaign, both majoriparties will have
to contend with the Liberal’s renewed and vigor-
ous eﬁorts to capture the all-important ﬂoating
voters.

The shift in emphasis will be from ideology.
and platform to personality and the dynamics in_

the character of the national party leaders. It is
doubtful, however, that the campaign will be
completely reduced to “I ‘Can. Do More For

~Manchester.’.’

The Shaping Battle . 

  Rebels Without

Cause

When a man thinks his property is being taken
away from him, it is as if a cold blow was ‘struck
him. It is as though he left a warm room to enter.
20 degree below zero weather. As the chill grips
him, he retreats into the
warmth of the room and bars
the door. ‘He can not act; he
can only react. He is in a
state of confusion; emotion
blinds his mind to the facts.
This is happening to people
throughout America; it is hap-
pening in Oakland. A
The wind of the redevelop-
ment hf Oakland has been
blowing for a long time. Peo-
ple in the community have

heard rumors that their homes will have to be

sold, have had men from the Urban Redevelop-
ment Authority of Pittsburgh assessing the con-

dition and value of their homes. They have read _'

newspaper articles about URA and the Oakland
Corporation and its Panther Holl.ow Project. Rep-
resentatives of Oak-Corp have spoken. to groups
such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary
Club. A-great number of the residents under-
stand the situation; but many are still bewildered
and confused. '

‘ Hlusfroi-ion of Confusion ~

The mass meeting held last week by the ‘,‘Citi-
zens Committee to Save Oakland from the Rav-
ages of Rdeevelopment” is a valid illustration of
this confusion. Local citizens lashed out at the re-
development planners without full knowledge of
the facts. Chairman Eugene DePasquale claimed
thati“some of the redevelopers reside in Euro-
‘pean ‘countries, never have visited the United
States, do not pay taxes here . . .’? This isnothing
but nonsense. A reporter’s mere phone call to
URA resulted in a clear picture of the redevelop-
ment procedure. Leo P. Dahl, executive vice-
president, and- Frank Nowak, assistant to the
president, spent several hours explaining the
goals of Oak Corp to us.

Many people at the meeting clouded the issue
because they do not understand the difference
between URA and Oak-Corp. They seized Chain-
cellor Litchﬁeld as their target because his name
is, most_familiar to them. Contrary to what they

‘ think, Oak-,Cor.p is not ‘the’ “big: bad wolf” which

   

 

By ‘Nancy Fuchs

‘is going to devour their property. Oak-Corp has

no power to take over their homes. It is only one
of seve_ral developmentalorganizations which will
bid on the redevelopment job as outlined by URA.
, This area is going to be an urban renewal
project with or without the existence of Oak-
Corp. How anyone can call Oakland a “thriving”
community, as was done at the meeting, is be-
yond me. It’s no secret that the merchants are
not getting the business they should in a univer-
sity community such as this. You almost have to
push your way through the Forbes street—corner

' loungers.

Thus, since the redevelopment is necessary, it
may as well _be done by Oak-Corp, comprised of
local educational, cultural, and religious institu-
tions concerned with the future of Oakland rather
than by other private developers who will reap
their proﬁts and leave for another city and an-
other project.

Boost to Economy / ‘
DePasquale called the citizens “victims” of the

iredeveloper’s selfishness” and said that “no rede_- _.
velopment in the United States in the. last 50-

years has been to the advantage of themajority
of thepeople affected.” This is a charge he can

not make against,.Oak-Corp. The research parki

to be -built in Panther ‘Hollow will boost the
economy of Oakland in particular and Pittsburgh

in general. The Pittsburgh area is badly in need—
of new industry. The research park will draw.

needed scientists, research experts, and techni-

,cians- to. Pittsburgh, and as Dahl put it, “will

keep, the Jonas Salk’s from leaving.”

To do this,_.Oak-Corp is doing what Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld is constantly stressing — utilizing
our'natural'resources to their best advantage. Or
as Dahl puts it, “we are making virtually a whole
city out of ‘practically nothing.” For not only will
it include research laboratories, but sunken court-
yards, recreational facilities and shops. The
“gulch” is yielding little tax money to the city,
but once the project is completed, the taxes will
add a substantial amount to city revenue.

In the heat of anger and confusion ‘of fear,
many of Oakland’s citizens are clouding the re-
development issue. Oakland will not be in the
predicament that East Liberty is in now if Oak-
Corp is the developer, for if the second part of
Pittsburghls renaissance isallowed to go through,
Oakland will be a better place to live.

1/31st Session

Now Underway

Since its founding in the

spring of 1949, the Univer-

sity’s Management Program
for Executives (MPE) has en-
rolled 1,608 executives in 30

‘ semi-annual sessions.

Represented in the program

.have been more than 300 organi-

zations in some 70 private domes-
tic industries, innumerable Federal
Government departments a n cl
companies in almost ‘50 other
countries.

A" This year’s MPE program -— the

,.._223lst session -— has enrolled 32

businesses representing 13 states,
seven foreign countries and the
District of Columbia. The program

“Eighty per cent of the program
is very good, ten per cent so-so,

good,” said Robert H. Widner,
disbursement accounting‘ man-
ager of the Bell Telephone Com-
pany of Pennsylvania and a par-

ticipant in MPE,

" “Atmosphere Stimulating”
He continued, “The atmosphere

is very stimulating and the pro- .,

gram has opened up a whole new
area which I was unaware of.”
Widner, like others in the
program, was selected by his
company owing to his evidence
of administrative ability. Most
program participants are in an
age bracket of 35 to 50 years.
Foreign applicants, such as
Raymond _F. La Court, assistant
general sales manager of Esso
(Belgium), must‘ be able to
speak and understand English
to be admitted as participants.
“For foreign people like my-
self,” he said, “a large difficulty
comes in amount of timenecessary

. to assimilate daily work.”

Some Duplication

Speaking in a characteristic ac-
cent, La Court added, “The topics
are extremely interesting and
there is some duplication, but the
overlapping is not bad. Some
topics are very new for some of
us since we just have a very sup-

erﬁcial knowledge of ‘ them at.

University much more than they

he added, “I enjoyed my first ,

stand what was going on, it was

A very exciting.”

George yr. Gipson, transporta-
tion superintendent for Central
Greyhound Lines, ﬁnds the pro-
gram, “quite like what I had ex-
pected. Since the work calls for
more industrial relations and ad-
ministrative practices, naturally I
enjoy it more.

“Express His Views”

“It is a good way to get ac-
quainted with other businessmen,
and everyone is free to express his
views.” .

He noted that the program
helped one to develop good
reading habits. A 15-year vet-
eran with Greyhound, Gipson,
related, “this is the ﬁrst college
(experience) that I’ve had.”

There are nine courses offered
in the general program and four
elective courses. Classes meet in
the Cathedral.

Soccer coach Leo Bemis at-
tributed an extremely tough
Maryland defense and a lack
of passing by the Panthers as
the basic causes for his team’s

of last week against Navy. Most
of the Panthers ran faster at
Navy, where the curose is con-
sidered to be more difficult.
The only good performance for

the Panthers was turnedin by
John Bailey. Bailey ﬁnished‘only
one second behind Lampman at
25:48, which was the sixth best
time everrecorded on the Penn
State course. i ~ V ,
For the last two miles Bailey

quarter mile that Lampman was
unable to get a lead over Bailey.
Both men ran the ﬁnal mile in
4:50. ' .

The Panther freshman also lost
to the Lions, but by a more re-
spectable, 27-32. The fresh cap-
tured second, third and fourth

shots. The team’s other lineman,
Bruno Schwarz, overshot a few
times, including one attempt
from 20 yards out with no one
between him and the goalie.

Th e Maryland offense shot
oftener and Bemis praised goalie
Tom Staab for his play. “He stop-
ped some good shots,” said Bemis.
“He didn’t actually have a chance
to stop either of Maryland’s goals
since our backs were beaten both
times.”

"Bemis made two changes in the
starting lineup. Gene Balkovec
started at right fullback in place

 

 

of Cal Bonawitz and George Som-
mer was moved up to halfback in
place of Jim Cuddy, who was
dropped back to Sommer’s old
spot. , '

Bemis started Balkovec be-
cause he had seen one of Mary-
lands standouts, John Ruhs, play
last year and felt that Balkovec

two points while a pass is only

Intramural director Leo Bemis
said, “The league was put on a
I’ double elimination basis because
the softball league forced a late
start on football and we want to
ﬁnish before the bad weather
 comes. “Another advantage of
 double-elimination play,” Bemis

' continued, “is that it enables a
 ,'team that may have lost once to
battle back through the loser’s
bracket. In .round robin play a
team that loses once rarely has
a chance to come back.”

Coach Impressed_With Squad ,

Bem is Says Freshmen
Better T hanl 962 Team

“Judging from their ﬁrst performance the freshman soc-
cer team seems to have an even better team than last year’s
undefeated group,”, said varsity coach Leo Bemis. The frosh

«crushed Slippery Rock, 7-0, in their opener.

‘ “A few of the fellows need to improve on their basic
skills, which they failed to'acquire because of insufficient

h i g h. school experience.
doubtedly, these boys will im-

prove because all of. them are co- ‘

ordinated athletes,” Bemis said.

The frosh take on Slippery
Rock again this Thursday at
Kennard Field. ,

Kermit Wessner, Al Traun-
steiner, Jim ‘Snyder, . and Sal
Tavares are among the outstand-
ing prospects for this year’s team.

Halfback Wessner is exception-
ally aggressive, a c _c ording 110
Bemis. “Although Jim Snyder,
another halfback, failed to score
in the ﬁrst contest, I feel that he
poses a strong offensive threat,”
saidlBernis.

“Goalie Dennis Schweber im-
proves day by day. Schweber can
kick the ball half the" length of
the football ﬁeld and throw with
considerable accuracy,” said
Bemis. '

Freshman coach McNulty tries
to stress accurate passing, since
possession is the keynote to scor-
mg.

Today, the working man
