Marcia Laurenson deals out the cards for a game of blackjack Friday night in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room as part of the Katz Graduate School of Business’ Charity Ball, which included many
Monte Carlo night events. The event was co-sponsored by KGSB, the Graduate and Professional
Student Association, USAir, "The Rebel" 104.7 FM and the Florida Travel Network. The proceeds

Martin Luther King Jr., David Duke, the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and the Ku Klux Klan all have something in common.
All have, at one time or another, sought help from the
American Civil Liberties Union fearing their constitu-
tional rights were in jeopardy.

The director of the western Pennsylvania ACLU
office, Vic Walczak spoke toa civil liberties class
Thursday morning in the Cathedral of T Learning.

' Walczak spoke for a little over an hour on the topics
of hate crime, hate speech, art and violence on televi-
sion.

The ACLU was formed in 1920, at a time when “you
were jailed for being a conscientious objector or a

, first amendment was there to protect free speech, not

free speech you like, but free speech. T T

The ACLU boasts a membership of 300,000 support-
ers and receives funding from membership dues,
grants from foundations and individual donations. The
ACLU has at least one office in every state, and is
involved with approximately 6,000 cases a year.

Prefacing his discussion on hate crime, Walczak
spoke about a case in Skoke, 111. where Nazis wanted
to stage a parade in a city that had a very high Jewish
population.

“Personally, for me this case is very emotional  lit’s
deeply offensive to me,” said Walczak, who had sever-
al relatives die in gas chambers in Nazi Germany.

SGB discusses
football season
ticket increase

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

In light of upcoming renovations to Pitt Stadium, the
Student Government Board is considering its support
for an increase in student season tickets.

“Currently, the $11 that students pay for student
tickets goes directly to the Division of Student Affairs
in the Williani Pitt Union,” Board member Heath
Golden said. He said in comparison to other schools,
students at Pitt pay much less for athletic mainte-
nance.

Golden and SGB President Ross Pasquale, who
toured Pitt Stadium facilities with Pitt Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes earlier in the week, both commented on
a possible price increase at the SGB meeting Thursday
evening.

A $9 increase was one estimate Golden said the ath-
letic department was ‘considering. This increase would
raise the price of student season tickets to $20.

Golden also said the administration should look to
improving the athletic facilities for all students if an
increase was put into place.

“Other issues must be discussed,” Golden said,
“such as club sports, intramurals and athletic facilities
for use by the student body.” He said the university
has a “very well established” club sport program,
including a national champion lacrosse team, which
will need support in future years.

Until this point, club sports have been funded by
the SGB, but Golden said ‘this cannot continue
because of dwindling funds and rising costs.

Pasquale said an increase should be considered
because, unlike fees included with tuition, a student
ticket is an option.

“Not all students are obligated to buy student tick-

ets,” Pasquale said. “They can choose to buy a ticket.

or not to buy a ticket, whereas fees go onto their bill.”

Both Pasquale and Golden said they could see a
definite need for renovations of athletic facilities.

Golden said the Pitt Stadium facilities, as well as
general—use facilities like Trees Hall, are “deplorable at
best.” ,

“I agree with Mr. Jaynes that something needs to be
done about renovating these facilities which ha_Ve not
been touched in decades,” Pasquale said. He also said

due to the restraints on recruiting, it is important for

off weekend of pro-life support

Reverend kicks

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

Reverend Patrick Mahoney stepped back
from the podium wiping the sweat from his
forehead. It was a planned pause in his ser-
mon; a pause that one learns to perfect
after preaching for over 16 years.

Gripping the sides of the podium again,
Mahoney shouted into the microphone,
“The pro—choice philosophy is the root of
all evil in our society.”

His speech was the kickoff of the
Students for Life weekend of demonstra-
tions to stop abortion, held on Friday night
in the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

According to Mahoney, a woman claim-
ing that she has the right to have an abor-
tion is no different from one who says, “‘I
will be like God  I can establish myself as
God’  [Abortion] is the choice to kill.”

“Justice, integrity, human rights don’t
matter,” Mahoney said. Mimicking a pro-
choicer he said,”’[It’sl my right. I decide.’
We are standing against a philosophy that

is breaking the heart of God,” he said.

Addressing a hypothetical college woman
who gets pregnant and claims not to be
able to afford the costs of having a child,
Mahoney said, “Hey, we all have painful,
difficult decisions to make.”

Before Mahoney’s speech began, mem-
bers of the Campus Women’s Organization,
the Lesbian Avengers, the Socialists
Workers’ Party, National Organization for
Women, feminist group Riot Grrrls and
members of the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance came into the ballroom holding
signs in protest of Mahoney’s speech.

Commenting on the demonstration,
Mahoney said “It is a mockery of the pro-
choice leaders to try to bring justice into
this country  If they’re not going to pro-
tect unborn children, why should they pro-
tect free speech?”

“They all came in and held their little
signs and left. I was real sad. They left just
when Jeff [Paladina, president of SfLl start-
ed to talk about abortion  I asked to let
them in. We want them to know the truth.”

Mahoney described his speech as the
“Cliff Notes outline on the impact of abor-
tion on our society. We have made the
main issue children dying. What we have
failed to address is what it is doing to [our]
families  It is the fundamental issue facing
America," he said.‘ "[A}9ortionl tears apart
the fabric of [the] American landscape and
creates a vacuum. In working on abortion
we are working on every issue  If a gov-
ernment official can’t decide when life
begins, then he shouldn’t be in office.”

Mahoney concluded his speech with two
pieces of advice for the pro—lifers. First,
when confronted by “your Christian friends
who tell you to get a life, don’t be so
obsessed with this abortion thing, tell them,
‘I’m getting a life, come join me.”’
Secondly, Mahoney told the audience not
to “surrender, no matter what it takes [to
stop abortionl,”

At the end of the speech, Sfl. public rela-
tions director Stephanie Pritchett said, “I
just hope that this is just the beginning and
we can save a child through this.”

schools to sell themselves through their
facilities.

“It is really difficult for Pitt to attract
top-notch athletes when competing
against schools like Penn State and West
Virginia who offer state of the art facili-
ties,” Pasquale said-

Pasquale said it is possible for a good
football team to improve a university in
various ways.

“It is easier to attract money from
alumni and attract the best and brightest
students in the admissions process
because everyone likes a winner,”
Pasquale said. He also said if a school is
publicly recognized, it can enhance
employers’ impressions of the school,
which beneﬁts graduates of that school.

Pasquale said regardless of theathletic
departments plans, the $11 which cur-
rently is charged for student tickets will

continue to fund student activities.

“It is used for the upkeep of V/PU, the
Emerging Leader program and allocated
at the discretion of the director,”
Pasquale said. “As far as an increase from
the $11, Uaynes] wants to work with stu-
dent activities and SGB. He talked about
various dollar amounts.

administration should decide if they want
to undertake a project costing $19.5 mil-
lion which would, for the most part, only
directly affect 500 student athletes or put
the money toward things that would
affect the student body as a whole."

Golden and Pasquale said they
would further investigate the matter
before taking a position on a possible
increase.

“The most exciting aspect is
that [through the Clinton

Waller said that the
Pennsylvania Service Corps has
been a demonstration project
for the national service corps

engineered by Clinton’s staff.
Corps members, according to
Waller, will get training to
become leaders in the commu-
nity-service field.

“Our ultimate goal is to cre-

commonwealth which will
have broad impacts on both

“We tend to write off mem-
bers in our society, especially
the young and the old,” Rogers
said. “This [program] is about
bringing folks together because
service is for young and old
alike. .
“[It’s an] idea that challenges
citizens from cradle to grave to
serve,” he said. “It’s a great

idea for you to compete for
young people.”

The original idea for a
national service program start-
ed around the beginning of the
Peace Corps, Rogers said. “It
just made sense to bring [that
kind of program] home.”

“It took the Peace Corps 27
years to get 100,000 -volun-
teers,” he said. “We want to get

that in three years.”

“It is industrious and it is
fast,” said PennSERVE’s execu-

Rogers said he thinks the
program will especially work in
Pennsylvania because it seems
to be volunteer—oriented. “We
are so far ahead of the rest of
the country in service,” he said.

“Members of the
Commonwealth should be
proud.”

“This plan is not for the
timid,” Cosgrove said. “The
solutions are only where the
problems are.

“There’s a difference in pretty
words and pretty actions,” he
added. “We want you to show
evidence of community out-
reach.”

United Way Community
Services Vice President Carmen
Segree told the audience that
by allowing Volunteers in the
AmeriCorps program to do
their service with their particu-
lar organization, they could
“think creatively about how to
use a corpsman.”

“See this as an invitation to
the imagination,” Rogers said.
“The challenge of making this
work is in your hands.”

you have free speech for no
one.”

Walczak said the answer to
hate speech is more speech. If
someone denies the holocaust,
you show them massive evi-
dence supporting the holocaust
with more speech.

Speaking on hate crimes, he
said, “The ACLU and I have a
problem with targeting a cer-
tain group. What if the govern-
ment said a crime committed
for religious reasons is not
as bad, or what if they say gay
and lesbians will get a higher
sentence.”

In response to hateful inci-
dents on campus, many univer-
sities have adopted anti-harass-
ment codes. These codes usu-
ally prohibit language that is
insulting and demeaning to
certain groups.

“Courts have found these
laws to be unconstitutional 
in terms of first amendment
rights, there’s no legal means
for enacting these codes,” said
Walczak.

Warning that free-speech
threats can come from any-
where on the political spec-
trum, he said “Free speech is
threatened not only by people
on the right, but by people on
the liberal left.”

Walczak also spoke about
the ACLU’s representation of
Pitt student David Brown last
year. Brown had entered a
painting in an art show, spon-

sored by the Pitt Program-

Council, and was told because

of the nature of the painting it

could not be exhibited.
Brown’s painting, a tree with

phallic branches, was eventual-

ly allowed in the exhibit after

“We want to be at the lead
and in the forefront of these
opportunities,” Milani said.

“By hosting this event, Pitt is
making a stronger commitment
to community service,” added
Nicole Monastra, the coordina-
tor of the Student Volunteer
Action Center.

Cosgrove said he was excited
about bringing his “show to
Pittsburgh.” He described
PennSERVE, which was found-
ed by the office of
Pennsylvania Governor Robert
Casey, as a “single entity focus-
ing on citizen service in the
community.”

All three presentations
focused on serving the commu-
nity to enhance personal edu-
cation and to gain a feeling of
self-satisafaction from the work.

As an incentive to recruit stu— .

offered.

_/Of? CO7j)S d7’lSZU€7' IO COu7’ll‘7j/'5 10063

This ‘country is in dire straits as it turns to face the
future. The number of ‘people taking advantage of
the opportunities for higher education is much too
low. The main problem is that it is not getting any
less expensive to go to college. However, the num-
ber of ways for students to pay for college is increas-
ing. So more students can enter higher education,
thus giving this country a better future.

Last Thursday morning, Martin Rogers, assistant to
Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford informed Pitt stu-

dents about their opportunities to participate in this

program which is “about revitalizing our nation.”
While more needs to be done to help students go
to college, Clinton’s national community service pro-
gram is an excellent start. Based on the Peace Corps,
it is designed to have students serve their country
and earn education credits. The program is focused
on having the students serve in four critical areas:
education, environment, public safety and unmet
human needs. Students over 17 with a high school
diploma will earn a yearly living stipend and health
care and become eligible for educational awards for
completing “full—time” service, which. is 1,700 hours
served overa period of nine months to one year.

These funds are not supposed to affect need-based .

financial aid which students receive for college. John
Cosgrove, director of PennSERVE said that the feder-
al government would pay 100 percent of any child
care costs program participants incurred.

Social service agencies such as the United Way
would use the students to continue their work. For

_the recruitment service the government provides,‘the

service agencies would foot 25 percent of the bill.
The program unites social service groups with the

national service corps to give them a good supply of

well—prepared people. Although the work may be

difficult, students should look into this as a reward-

ing way to pay for their college education. The coun-
try needs people to serve in all areas, and this is an
excellent chance for students to begin in the “real
world” by making a positive difference for this

-nation; This is a positive step toward rebuilding our

country at all levels, and this rebuilding is sorely
needed. The country’ will gain more highly-educated
people with a civic_ consciousness, and problems
which need direct attention will be dealt with
through this program.

Although more needs to be done to encourage
people to further their‘ education, and although this
program is not a panacea, anything which helps stu-
dents gain advanced education is a step in the right
direction.

In the Feb: 10 issue of The Pitt News, I.wrote
an editorial in which I condemned the practice

oppose this practice, I must clarify one crucial
elementof my article which has caused consid-
erable controversy. In discussing a Soviet history
class in which I was once enrolled, I inadver-
tently suggested that our midterm exam was
graded according to our ideological beliefs. This
was certainly not the case. Although the profes-
sor and I have vastly different political opinions,
the essays were graded fairly and without regard
to ideological statements.

After reviewing the essay questions, I must
clarify my description of the exam. The second
choice of essays did not necessarily “rationalize”
Stalin’s regime. Rather, the professor asked us to
argue that while Stalin was a violent ruler, he is
not the only explanation for the political chaos
in the Soviet Union in the 19305. We were asked
to argue that Stalin’s system may “not have been
totalitarian, but rather a more traditional dictator-
ship.” This does not make the exam question
“pro-Stalin," but rather asks the student to con-
sider the opposition within the country and
within the Communist Party itself.

I reported that we were advised that “we had
a better chance of receiving a high grade” if we
wrote this essay. I was told in my recitation sec-

reason for this advice, which had nothing to do
with the students’ personal opinions.

The first choice basically asked us to support
the View that Stalin was a ruthless, tyrannical
leader. The reason we were told that students
who answered the other question had a slight
advantage was that there is simply more tangible
proof to support that question. ‘

Once again, I must state that there was no cor-
relation between grades and political beliefs in
this Soviet history course. The purpose of my
article was not to suggest that there was, but
rather to illustrate a larger point about politics in
the classroom. In approaching this topic, I admit
to using an unfortunate choice of words, such as
labeling the essay “pro-Stalin,” which, with the
benefit of hindsight, was a misleading term.

When I wrote this piece, it had been nearly a
year since some of my examples had taken
place. I will concede that it was irresponsible to
rely on generalization rather than to research the
facts of the issue more clearly, especially in light

of how much time had passed since the exam
itself. I will not apologize for the political stance
of my editorial, but it was not a personal vendet-
ta. If my statements gave the impression that
grades at Pitt are dependant on agreeing with a
professor’s views, that was not my goal, and I
apologize for the misunderstanding.

Men's swim
team regains
Big East title
after a year

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

For the 11th time in 12
years the Pitt men’s swim-
ming and diving team has
captured the Big East
Championship this weekend
at Trees Pool.

The Panthers 1994 title was
won in an impressive fash-
ion: They finished with 675
points, 73 points better than
the second—place finisher
Syracuse.

Pitt relinquished the title to
Villanova last year for the
first time in a decade.

“The hardest thing to do in
sports was for Villanova to
come in and knock us off last
year,” head coach Chuck
Knoles said. “The second-
toughest thing to do is to
come back and regain the
championship after we lost
it.”

Villanova, the former
champion, finished third with
595.5 points. Miami finished
with 555 points, Connecticut
with 328, St. _l’(3l‘1ﬁ:§ 2'62,
Seton Hall 218, Boston
College 172, Providence
148.5 and Georgetown 73.

The diving team started off
the meet with a boom, giving
Pitt a 100-point cushion
before the swimmers even
hopped in the pool.

Friars kill Lady Panthers o boards, wi 3-82

By Ryan Buncher

Asst. Sports Editor

Ongoing problems with foul
trouble and rebounding cost the
Pitt women’s basketball team
Saturday afternoon as
Providence took a big lead early
and held on to beat the Lady
Panthers, 93-82, as both teams
finished their regular seasons in
Rhode Island.

“We got beat on the boards
real bad,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said.

“We didn’t get our hands on
the ball enough. They shot
twice as many free throws as we
did. We had to score from the
ﬁeld because we weren’t getting
to the line.”

The win was not enough for
Providence, fourth in the Big
East at 10-8 (12-14 overall) to
catch the third place Lady
Panthers (18-8, 12-6 in the con-
ference), but a win would have
helped Pitt’s bid for an invita-
tion to the NCAA tournament.

“We don’t know what is going
on in the selection committees

minds,” Bruce said.

“We’ve got to win games. You
help yourself for NCAA selec-
tion by winning games. We
could play three games in the
Big East tournament. If we win
all three, we have 21 wins. No
way to keep us out.”

Pitt will start that tournament
Saturday at 1 p.m. against
Miami. The Hurricanes moved
into a tie for sixth place with
Villanova at 7-11 in the confer-
ence yesterday when the
Wildcats lost to Syracuse 79-66,
and the Hurricanes won both of
their meetings with Villanova
this season.

“There are some things we
have to correct no matter who
we are playing in the tourna-
ment,” Bruce said.

“We have to correct our
aggressiveness. We have to cor-
rect our post defense. We have
to correct our passing to people
who are open to score.

"Little things we have to cor-
rect before our next game.”

Debbie Yohman said.

Ball State assistant coach Scott
Roth said that his team’s results
were a bit lower than their pre-
vious score of 190. He said that
his gymnasts had trouble on the
balance beam.

Although suffering the
absence of some key athletes,
the Lady Panthers did not break
under pressure.

Robyn Senior, normally a Pitt
all-around performer, did not
compete due to a toe injury sus-
tained during practice. Co-
Captain Meg Johns did not com-
pete either.

Witli a shorter lineup, Pitt had
to make some adjustments. To
pinch hit for Pitt, Trish Sigafoos
and Christine Battista debuted
on balance beam. Their scores
were 8.05 and 8.6, respectively.

Yohman said she knew what
scores had to be earned by
Sigafoos and Battista in order
for Pitt to keep a consistent
team score.

“Neither one of them were
ready,” Yohman said. “All I said
they needed was a 7.0 to kinda
take the pressure off of them
and say, ‘Go for it —— you guys
were thrown into this entirely
unprepared.’ They both said
they wanted to do it, and they
did a real good job.” '

Pitt’s total beam score was
45.0. Stevens’ first-place score
was 9.55. Other gymnasts and
their scores on beam for Pitt
were Lori Buck (9.45), Bethany
Toellner (8.8) and Michelle Cole
(8.6).

Yohman said that although
the team had two falls on beam
(causes for the deduction of
points), the scores from

Sigafoos and Battista made up '

for the losses.

Cheri Meckes, a recent addi-
tion for Pitt, vaulted on
Saturday. Her score was 8.5.

‘Other Pitt vaulters were Battista

(9.3), Buck (8.85), Toellner
(9.15), Cole (9.15) a.nd Stevens
(9.575).

Women's

swim ends

up fourth

in Big East

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Villanova women's
swimming and diving
team won their third con-
secutive Big East champi-
onship this weekend at
Trees pool.

“The way Villanova
looks at Big East is that
each year is different,"
Villanova junior Meagan
McCaffrey said. “Even
though we won the last
two years doesn’t mean
we didn’t have anything
to prove this year.”

The Pitt women fin-
ished in fourth place, just
one point behind
Syracuse, and 15 points
behind second-place
Miami. I

“This was really any-
body’s Big East,” Pitt
junior Vicki Geubtner
said. “It came down to the
last relay for us and we
ended up finishing a
point behind third.”

Sophomore diver
Sunday Lewandowski
was the only Pitt partici-
pant with an individual
Big East championship,
with her first in the one-
meter diving. She finished
second in the three-meter
competition.

“I had a decent meet,”
Lewandowski said. “I felt
really good on one-meter.
On three-meter I didn’t
do as well, but I’m
happy.’’

Miami junior Tiffany
Sniegocki won the three-
meter and was the meet’s
Outstanding Diver. And
Miami rookie Kristel
Tellegen was the meet’s
Outstanding Swimmer.
She was the Big East
champion in three events,
the 2()O—yard individual
medley, the 4()O—yard indi~
vidual medley, and the
20()—yard breaststroke.

“This is awesome,”
Tellegen said. “Everybody
tells me what I did was
incredible. I just swim my
races and hope to win.”

Pitt’s senior captain, Jen
Burns, had an outstand-
ing meet of her own for
the Panthers. She finished
second in the 100-yard
and 200-yard, and third in
the 500—yard freestyle.

“Those are the highest
places I’ve ever had here
and my three best times
ever,” Burns said. ‘‘I
couldn’t be any happier,”

Villanova finished with
569 points, Miami 505,
Syracuse 491, Pitt 490,
Connecticut 457, Seton
Hall 518, Boston College
238, St. johns 183, and

throughout the season showed
up in the extreme against the
Friars. Providence dominated
the glass, grabbing 53 rebounds
while Pitt had only 27. Senior
center Stephanie Goettsche, the
number two rebounder in the
conference, grabbed 17
rebounds and scored 25 points.

“We just didn’t play an
aggressive game,” Bruce said.
“They were a lot more aggres-
sive than we were.”

Providence hit 34 free throws
in the game, the most made by
any Big East team in a game this
season. Their total of 44
attempts was second only to the
45 tries the Friars had from the
line Nov. 30 against Boston
University.

“They took the ball to the bas-
ket more than we did,” Bruce
said. “We were finessing it. Had
we not fouled so much, we
might have won the game.”

Rookie point guard Mandy

Saunders had a record-setting
day at the line. Her 19 made
foul shots and 21 attempts are
both Big East rookie records.
Her 100 free throws in confer-
ence play is also a Big East
mark for rookies.

Saunders led all scorers with
27 points despite four-of—1-4
shooting from the field.

“We didn’t do a very good job
stopping her,” Bruce said. “We
fouled her most of the time.
She’s smart enoughrto know
that if she’s not scoring from the
field, she’s taking it to the hoop
and drawing fouls.”

Foul trouble also limited for-
ward Jenine Joyce to 18 min-
utes. Joyce led Pitt with nine
points in the first half but didn’t
score a point after the break and
fouled out on a charging call
with 10:54 remaining in the
game.

With Joyce on the bench most
of the game and two other
starters, Jill Colabrese and
Carolyn Miller, struggling
(seven points combined), Bruce
turned to his bench.

Senior Erin Maloy provided a
long—range threat, scoring all of
her 15 points on five three-point
shots. Rookie Missy Thompson
provided some help inside with
14 points and a team—high seven
rebounds.

“She’s playing so well,” Bruce -

said.

“She played pretty good
defense, and she rebounded the
ball well. She seemed to be the
one scoring inside. She was
really aggressive in there, some
thing we’ve needed from her for
a long time. We’re very encour-
aged by that.”

Pitt was able to take away the
three-point shooting of the Lady
Friars, who often average 6.82
per game and have fired up
more than 25 attempts from
beyond the arc eight times this
season. The Lady Panthers, who
have been successful all season
defending the three, held
Providence to one—for—eight
three-point shooting.

“We didn’t want to give up a
lot of threes,” Bruce said. “We
did a nice job there, butlwe
didn’t rebound the ball.”

Despite Pitt taking away their

Yohman said that the vault
performances met the goals
that had been set before the
meet.

She said that the floor exer-
cise also met expectations.

“Everyone on floor did
what we needed them to do,”
Yohman said.

Pitt’s team ﬂoor score was

46.425. On floor, newcomer
Meckes scored an 8.9. Stevens
and Toellner tied for second
place with identical scores of
9.55. The rest of the Pitt
scores on floor were Cole’s
9.2 and Buck’s 9.225.

Pitt’s total for the fourth
event, the uneven parallel
bars, was 44.2.

» Tracy McKenna, who had

been out of the lineup earlier
his season with a knee prob-
lem, earned a bar score of
9.025. Yohman said that the
McKenna score was the
expected high score for bars.

Part of the fast pace came
from the fact that Pitt was play-
ing catch-up from the opening
moments of the game.
Providence led from the open-
ing basket, a three-point play by
Goettsche, and took a double
digit lead, 27-16, 12 minutes in
on two free throws by Saunders.

Huemrich and Joyce both
picked up their third fouls in the
final two minutes of the first

half. Joyce did it by fouling
Ayanna Walden with three sec-
onds left in the half. Walden hit
one foul shot, giving the Lady
Friars a 39-28 halftime margin.

Providence opened the sec-
ond stanza with a 10-2 run,
extending its bulge to 49-32.
Saunders capped the run by
drawing Joyce’s fourth foul and
hitting both free throws.

Pitt turned to a lineup with
Huemrich, Thompson, Maloy,
Carol Morton and track—convert
Katina Miles, which began to
bring the Lady Panthers back.

“They did a real nice job
pressing [Providence] hard,”
Bruce said.

“We got the ball to Erin, and
she hit a couple threes. We got
a few steals and converted a
couple times.

"If we had converted off all
the steals we got in that period,
we’d have been in the
lead.”

Champs  

Continued from page 7

Braud right behind him in
third in the three-meter
dive. Jeremy McClean fin-
ished fifth.

On the one-meter
board it was more of the
same. Braud finished sec-
ond, Soulakis in third and
McClean in fourth. Steve
Wolfe also finished sixth.

“Our diving was clearly
a big help,” head diving
coach Julian Krug said.
“We put the points on the
board in the beginning of
the meet and we never
trail the meet. We
outscored Villanova by a
little over 100 points and
it is very difficult for them
to imagine overcoming
that in a competitive
swimming meet.” '

Then, it was up to the
swimmers to pick up
where the divers left off.

Matt Brady won the
400-yard individual med-
ley with a NCAA consid-
eration time.

David Williams won the
200-yard freestyle with an
NCAA consideration time.
Jonti Backarack finished
fourth. Williams also
placed second in the 100-
yard freestyle.

Chris Perry was
involved in one of the
most exciting races of the
weekend when he fin-
ished second in the 200-
yard breaststroke.

To put it mildly, the
team was happy to get
back “their” title.

“We won, we won,
that’s all I can say,” senior
Braud said of his last Big
East Championship. “I’m
ecstatic. I’m loving life
right now. I’m on a natur-
al high and I can’t come
down."

There will he more
highlights of the Panthers
Big East Championship
tomorrow.
