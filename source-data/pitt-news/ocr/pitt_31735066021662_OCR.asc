Brandeis president to
speak at opening of
new honors college

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

President Wesley Posvar has
announced that President Evelyn
Handler of Brandeis College will
be the keynote speaker at the offi-
cial opening of the Honors Col-
lege Feb. 24.

Posvar saidhe is pleased with
the decision and the fact that a
”woman of high academic stand-
ing and achievement” will be the
guest speaker. ’

The announcement was made
as, part of Posvar’s report to the
University Senate on Monday.

He also said the search for a
new provost is ongoing and that
approximately 100 applications
have been received. Applicants
are currently being interviewed,
according to Posvar. Former
Provost Roger Benjamin left the
post to take a similar position at
the University of Minnesota this
past summer.

Proposals in committee con-
cerning two insurance plans, one
called ”f|exible spending,” the
other a ”cafeteria p|an,”_were dis-

cussed in terms of when such
plans might be implemented.

John Yeager, vice president of
management and budget, said
that one of the two plans may be-
gin ”in less than two years.” ‘

‘ ”| don’t’know what's involved
in putting in a cafeteria plan,” he
said.

Yeager said that while both

plans are proposed, if either one

is implemented, the othermight
be dropped because the remain-
ing plan would only add confu-
sion to the process.

Several members of the Senate
agreed that ”nobody understands
the new tax bill,” and until the
confusion concerning new tax
laws is cleared, further discussion
and implementation of the plans
will be delayed. /.

Student. Government Board
President Phil Moyer reported
that the board is hoping to form
a coalition of student government
boards from colleges in the Pitts-
burgh area. ‘He also said plans for
an escort service for students be-
gun by the previousboard will
continue.

Schambach was required to

’’I hope this clears every-
thing up and this is the end of

According to police reports .
Shambach, Baker and Platt
were allegedly involved in an
altercation on Nov. 8 in an
apartment at 222 Melwood
Ave. in North Oakland.

Bob Wooldridge, a former
Pitt student who was present
at the time of the altercation
was not implicated.

Silence isn't golden when 

your job is making noise

J. Ordinarily, the Pitt pep band is
a familiar sight at Panther basket-

ball games. The pep band plays

at all home games and select
away games. However, when the
band was informed Monday that
they would not be playing at the
Pitt-Duquesne game that night,
they wanted to know why.

Lynne Hannen, a member of
Pitt's pep band, said, ’’I couldn't
believe that we were not permit-
ted to play.’’

According to associate athletic

director at the University of Pitts-
burgh, Dean Billick, ”Duquesne
did not notify [the assistant band
director] Dave Moy of the deci-
sion until Monday afternoon [Jan.
12].” Moy had sent a request for
permission to play at Monday's
game to Duquesne on Nov. 24.

He did not receive a reply until '

Jan. 12.

According to Hannen,
decided to pay for tickets for the
members of the pep band and al-
low them to play at the game.
The‘ university did purchase the
ticketsj however, the band was
not permitted to perform. ‘

”We sent the band even
though they were not performing.
We are able to send them to so
few away games that we felt that
they deserved to go,” said Billick,

Because the Dukes host their
home games in the Civic Arena,

it is Duquesne University that
foots the bill for the contract. It is
their prerogative to set the terms
for the visiting teams. -

Billick noted, .’’I was disap-

pointed in Duquesne’s decision
not to allow the pepband to play.
Sometimes, I think it is necessary
to rise above the coaching men-
talities and do what is best for the
game.”

Duquesne’s sports information
director, Nelson King, stated, ’’I
didn't believe that it was in the
best interest of the team or in the
best interest of the university to
allow Pitt's pep band to play at

i the game.” i V 
King added, ’’I felt that the at-- , ~

mosphere would be more con-
ducive to the game if Pitt's pep
band was not permitted to play.
I made this decision in the best

 

interest of Duquesne University , V iii? A

and not in the best interest of the
University of Pittsburgh.” "
”We were very displeased with
the course of action that, Du.-
quesne took. I feel it was wrong.
Traditionally, it is the support of
the cheerleaders and of the band

that add to the flavor to the game. _

We do not plan to allow this to, l P; if

happen in the future,” said,‘

Hotel worker charged with setting deadly fire

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Fed-
eral officials Tuesday arrested an
employee of the Dupont Plaza
Hotel in Puerto Rico and charged
him with setting the New Year's
Eve fire that killed 96 and injured
I70.

Officials said Hector Escudero
Aponte worked at the luxury
hotel as a maintenance worker
and was a member of the team-
sters’ union.

Investigators have already
claimed that the fire was started
by an arsonist, and charges of un-
ion involvement have surfaced.
The union denies starting the fire.

The hotel union voted to strike
just minutes before the blaze
broke out.

ments describing Israel's role in
the Iran—Contra affair was not in-
tended as a criticism of Israel's
actions.

The White House official said
the message expressed the per-
sonal sentiment of President
Reagan.

The Reagan administration be-
gan releasing pages of documents
and memos last Friday after infor-
mation about them began leaking
from the Senate Intelligence
Committee.

Accordingto officials at the
State Department, in the rush to
hand the documents out, the
United States failed to follow the
normal diplomatic courtesy of in-
forming lsrael ahead of time that
it might be embarrassed by the
disclosures.

The information disclosed ap-
parently indicates that Israeli offi-
cials led President Reagan to
believe that one sale of arms to
Iran would free all the American
hostages in Lebanon.

Israel, however, insists that the
United States came to them for
help, which they gave.

Analysts say the Israelis benefit

greatly by keeping the Iran-Iraq

$3 million given for study

 

By Marc Duchin
For The Pitt News

I‘ Feeling lonely or sad is de-
velopmentally normal for a child.
However, one child on every
school bus, or one in 50, ex-
periences clinical depression,
much more severe than simple
loneliness orrsadness.

Clinical depression is extreme
sadness that changes an individu-
a|’s thinking and behavior.
Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic recently received a $3 mil-
lion grant from the National In-.
stitute of Mental Health for the
study of the neurobiology of
depressed and suicidal behavior
in school-age children.

With this grant, over half the
nation's research in childhood
depression is being done in
Pittsburgh. _

Childhood depression, like
adult depression, is characterized

feelings of guilt, inability to ex-

A" perience pleasure, tiredness, ir-

by a depressed mood, unrealistic

ritability, changes in sleep and
appetite. Clinical depression is
difficult to distinguish from nor-
mal temporary sadness in young
children, since the child may not
be capable of identifying and
describing his or her feelings to
an adult. '
Strong evidence from previous
research at both WPIC and other
academic medical centers indi-
cates that childhood depression
often occurs in families with a
strong history of depression and
is associatedwith an increased
risk of suicide later in life. The

major emphasis of the current I

grant are on the comprehensive
study of possible neurobiological
trait markers, family patterns and
suicidal behavior.

”Both the genetic and family
environments play major factors
in depression,” said _ Dr. Neal
Ryan, director of the Childhood

Depression Center. ”At this
point, we don't really know
which factor is more important.”
Researchers said they hope to
learn whether the biological dis-
turbances that occur during‘
depression are actually present in
non—depressive children whose
families have. a historyof

depression.

Men's rights: a new 

3

position on sexism

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

If, perchance, you just hap-
pened to pick up the latest copy
of Penthouse magazine — or
maybe you just happened to
glance at your roommate’s copy
— you may have read Sidney
Siller’s insightful look into a new
issue. Are women playing fair on
the job, or are they making the ut-
most use of their feminine wiles?

Are their bosses couching
them, or are they couching their
bosses?

Siller, who is also a lawyer, ad-
dresses this issue in his essay,
”Men’s Rights,” in the February
issue of Penthouse. He discusses
the Meritor Saving Bank vs. Vin-
son case that allowed for wom-
en employees to sue their
superiors on the grounds of sex-
ual harassment.

The case was originally un-

his New York office, Siller said
that women are not really ”cry-
ing wolf,” but they are optimiz-
ing their situations.

’’I think they saw their oppor-
tunities, and they conquered
them,” said Siller. ”That’s human
nature. But if the law permits the
defense of consent to be barred,
that permits wholesale prosti-
tution.” -

Siller, V who would not say
whether he supported the Equal

Rights Amendment, calls himself '

an ”equal rights person” and says
that the ERA is redundant.

”The constitution protects all of
us — it's a question of‘enforce-
ment,” said Siller.

Siller said that rulings such as
this produce a lot of corruption
and a lot of false cases. ”The
Supreme Court doesn't under-

stand what -goes on between boys I

and girls." 1
According to Siller, most men

According to Dr. Joaquim
Puing-Antich, principle, investiga-
tor of the project, ”These findings
will significantly bring us closer
to the prevention of depression in
both children and adults. By
identifying those at highest risk
for developing the illness, we
may be able to intervene and
.treat these individuals before a
life-long illness begins its progres-
sion. Our current work will ena-

resolved ‘in a district court after
they determined that the liaison
was mutual and that Vinson had
climbed the ladder of success by
her own merits. ,
However, the Supreme Court

cause even if Vinson consented
to the relationship, it just didn't
matter in a claim like this.

that the resurgence of a sexually
conservative atmosphere in the
social environment will have an
impact on the working environ-

And as for the advice he gives

relationships, he said, ”And so it

New aid plan is

not good enough

A recent study by the American Council on Education and
UCLA tells us that a majority of students list finding a well-
paying job as the No. 1 priority as they enter college.

Asthe teachings of Charles Dickens quietly fade‘ into the noise
of»Money magazine calling us to quick wealth and the securi-
ty of an IRA, students are falling deeper into debt than at any
other time in history. _ —

The average debt after four years is now $9,000 for those
at private colleges and $6,700 for borrowers at public colleges.

College tuition rates are increasing 6 to 9 percent each year.

.As tuition and the use of federal loans has increased, the use
‘woof grants and scholarships has decreased.

Perhaps the most damaging result of rising tuition costs is
the fear and pressure on students who choose a career not on
the..basis of personal preference but rather as a business de-
cision. ' r ‘

An experimental program developed by the federal govern-

ment to ease pressure on students offers non-subsidized loans

to a maximum of $1 7,500. There is no fixed term of.repayment,

 ' _and borrowers repay at an amount no higher than 15-percent
 or income. ' '

It has not been determined how much the plan will provide
to individuals, so the benefit to poor and needy students is un-
clear. The.potential drawback is a parallelcut in grants forneedy
students, ' '

The program is an experimental one. While it may work well,
it would seem the government is replacing an old, flawed sys-
tem with an equally flawed new one.

. ' Schools are eager to parade their technical programs before

the public eye, eager to speak of the excellence of their gradu-

Liberalism, in essence, was the

-discovery _of a world beyond

prejudice. The challenges that

this realization brought were the

struggles of racial integration,
equality before the law, equal op-
portunity and the augmentation
of civil liberties that was inevita-
ble when the downtrodden found
themselves with a voice through
which to express their achieve-
ments and frustrations.
Unfortunately, liberalism was
‘not quite up to the task. With the
integration of the schools came
the apathy of the teachers. In-
stead of rising to the challenge of
widespread drug abuse, child
abuse and sexual excess, liberals
left it to society to sort out the
consequences of its welfare and
school integration programs.
Reaganism was ‘a reactionary
backlash against the insipid and
ineffectual liberalism that had at-

tempted to bring the real world i

into the living room of Middle
America.‘ And we have had quite
enough of that, thank you.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January I4, 1987

Traveling is fun,

The terrible New Year's Eve fire
at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in
Puerto Rico and the Amtrak pas-
senger train accident in Maryland
over the weekend point out one
of the truths of life on the road:
You never know. .

That sounds obvious to say, but
many travelers forget it. The trav-
el industry spends millions of dol-
lars advertising the luxuries that
are for sale to a globe—trotting
public. You see ads and the com-
mercials all the time: the weary
businessman walks into a hotel
room; it is warm—looking and soft-
lylighted; a huge bed, its covers
turned down, lures him. The im-
plicit message is that what awaits
the businessman is even better
than what he has at home.

_ Here, in the hotel, is a- respite
from care. The traveler boards a
sparkling-clean airliner. A flight
attendant assists the traveler_ to
her seat and provides a pillow.
Fade to the meal: A dinner that
would_be the envy of any four-
star restaurant is brought to the fli-
er, along with offerings of red and
white wine. There seems to be no
more peaceful place in the uni-
verse than aboard this airplane.

”Can you spare some change” —-—

. ”Spare any change?"

If Forbes Avenue passed
beneath your boots during the
first week of the semester, you are
certainly awareof the subjectof
this column. He will not go away,
this unshaven gentleman with the
Styrofoam cup full of nickels and
dimes. He lingers near the inter-
section of Bouquet Street from
morning to midnight, engaging
everyone who passes.

. His name nobody knows. His
predicament nobody knows. His
future nobody knows.

His spiel everyone knows. His
pitch consists of three words in a
mumbled monotone.

”Spare any change?” _

He patrolled the sidewalk out-
side the Kings Court Theatre one
night not long ago. Tom between
two barstools, I passed his station
six times. Six times he repeated

Q.We’ve known each other
-five years and started dating a

had our first love session
together. After he reached or-
gasm, he rolled over and con-
cluded our lovemaking. It
happened again last night. See-

I ing that we've been good friends

a long time, I saw nothing wrong
in telling him that I was not satis-
“fied to the fullest and would like
for us to work at reaching my or-
gasm, too —-— not just his.

I think I offended his masculin-
ity because he said no one had
ever told him that before and that

The train wends its way
through some of the most spec-
tacular scenery the United States
has to offer. In the advertisement,
the photograph is shot from far
above. The train looks almost like
a toy amid the breathtaking
mountains and land. Anyone
who is allowed to ride on a train
like that should count his good
fortune. '

And the fact of the matter is, the
travel industry has .a remarkable
safety record. When we hear
about a plane crash or a train
wreck or a hotel fire, it is always
shocking news. We are used to
being lulled by months on end of
non-catastrophic events.

That is why the juxtaposition of
two awful travel-related tragedies
in a row —— the San Juan hotel fire
and the Maryland train accident
— strikes us so vividly. It ‘reminds
us that no matter how much faith
we put in the people who are as-
signed to make things go smooth-
ly, on the road, the day is. inevi-
tably going to come when there
is a mistake.

quarter into his. cup. Once I

..take a hint, I-surmised._

It was me who could not take
the hint.

His habitat extends beyond
Oakland. I was walking down-
town one afternoon when I spot-
ted him 'near the McDonald's at
Forbes and Wood. Perhaps he
had finally learned his lesson.
College students don't have
much money. Downtown is
where the money is. It is also
where the competition is,
however.

The next evening he was back
in Oakland. '

”Spare anychange?”
I ran across him one evening at
Primanti’s, and the image per-

care about him, is a good starting
place. That helps a lot, but you
have to know the kind of thing
that is likely to hurt him or make
him defensive. Otherwise, not
wanting to hurt is pathetic. With-
in the good feelings you have for
each other, the long friendship,
you still have to be tactful.

A man usually has to learn
what a woman needs because the
man is nearly always capable of
achieving an abrupt kind of satis-
faction, whereas "the woman
almost always needs wooing,

about travel are usually people
with a fierce need to control
things. When those people are in
their homes or at their offices,
they feel that they are in charge.
Whatever may happen during the
course of the day, they — at least
in their minds — are the people
who will determine it.

Once they travel, though, they
lose their sense of control. In an
airplane, someone else is in the
cockpit, in control. On board a
train, someone else is throwing
the track switches, in control. In

a hotel, someone else is respon-
-sible for making sure that every-

closest to the register, wolfing
down a cup of coffee. He held
the’ cup with both hands, not only
warming his dirty fingers but pro-
tecting his prize from the other
patrons. He had earned it. A hard,
humiliating night in Oakland.

that San Juan hotel

thing goes all right, in control.

Most travelers, even the so-
called ”control freaks,” are able
to put their anxieties aside when
they are on the road. After all,
they are surrounded by hundreds
of other people —- on the air-
planes,_aboard the trains, in the
hotels — and all of those other
people are putting their faith in
the travel professionals. And with
only the rarest of exceptions,
things turn out all right.

But then there are pictures on
the television news of thick, black
clouds of smoke pouring out of
the high-rise hotel or of train cars
crumpled atop each other on a
remote area of track. .

And that's when people start
saying to themselves: I could
have been in that hotel; I could
have been on that train.

The aspect of all this that fright-
ens people the most is that it is
never the fault of the victims
when incidents such as the most
recent tragedies occur. No one in
A can be
blamed for what happened. If
you paid attention to the inter-
views with the survivors, it is ap-
parent that the only difference

sullen — not that he ever smiles
— but he stayed to himself. He
drank as if he had not in days.
Perhaps he hadn't.

Once finished, his cup fol-
lowed him into the wintry streets.

”Spare any change?”

_I was moved to write this
column, to make this one request

that may sound even more

farfetched than ' the beggar’s.
Please, take this man seriously.
He represents the "American
Dream gone awry, that same
dream, that makes it possible for
students to attend this university
an_d pursue whatever they wish.
He attends, of all places, the col-
lege campus, an institution which
stands apart in ‘that it makes
dreams fulfillable. As students,
we horde the most valuable

obliged to learn their parts, and
since you have no experience at
all by your own frank admission,
it was easy for each of you to up-
set the other.

Now you can repair things by
saying, ’’I’m sorry I sounded less-_
than loving.'I like being intimate
with you. I like pleasing you. It's
just that lovemaking has to grow
between people, and I don't
know how to take part in it yet —-
not fully.”

Why does it have to be you
who takes charge of repairing the
damage and of persuading him to
develop as a lover? Because you

and the people who survived was
the luck factor. Once the fire
started, the guests inside the hotel
frantically tried to find a path to
safety. Some started downstairs
and were directed to go up
toward the roof; some started up

toward the roof and were direct- . . ‘

ed to go back down.
And on the Amtrak train, the
passengers could not ask them-

selves what they might have done ‘

to escape death or serious inju-
ry. They could have done noth-
ing; it was all out of their hands.
They bought their tickets, and
they put their faith in others, and
then came the terrible crash.

In the next few weeks, people
will be more cautious. They will
check into hotels and inquire
about fire exits. They will board
trains and never quite let their

~ minds drift from what is going on -

out on the tracks. ,

But in the end, as always, it will
be a matter of fate. On the road,
things almost always work out for
the best. And on those rare occa-
sions when they don't, it gives lit-
tle comfort to search for a reason
why.

Principal, 36, said in the Su-

sue, Joe Zeff talks about the
"Spare any change?” man who
works the streets of Oakland.

In many cases, a person
such as this will tell a brief
story about why you should
give him your spare change.

“This man doesn't, but if his
take for the day begins to go
down, he probably will.

Oral Roberts is doing the
same thing. He calls himself
an evangelist, but when com-
paring him to the man on our
streets, there is little difference.

Roberts is a bum — a rich
bum who supposedly talks to ‘
God —. but a bum nonetheless.

Equally disturbing in these
accounts is that Victoria Prin-
cipal is apparently prone to ill-
ness when hearing a phone‘
ring.

Perhaps she could have
taken the phone off the hook
or turned off the ringer. Then

Editor's Note: On /an. 17,
1977, murderer Gary Gilmore
died before a Utah firing squad,
the first person executed after the
U.S. Supreme Court lifted its ban
on capital punishment. Ten years
and 67 executions later, the na-
tion's death rows are crowded
with inmates waiting to die; con-
stitutional issues have formed a
new legal discipline, and public
opinion remains strongly in favor
of the death penalty.

By Fred Bayles

Associated Press Writer

HUNTSVILLE, Texas — In the
chilly midnight still, the state of
Texas sent a lethal mix of poisons

coursing through Michael Wayne

Gilmore

Editor's Note: — Moments af-
ter 36-year-old Gary Gilmore was
strapped to an old office chair in
1977, a five—man firing squad
ended his life, making-him. the
first person executed in the Unit-
ed States in 10 years. Despite 66
other executions in the decade
since his death, Gilmore remains
a symbol for death penalty advo-
cates and opponents alike.

By Vern Anderson

Associated Press Writer

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — Up
until the moment a volley" of rifle
bullets ripped through the target
over his héart 10 years-ago, Gary
Gilmore could have changed the
script. He was, after all, its author.

The execution he refused to
stop Jan. 17, 1977, was the first

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January I4, 1987

Evans’ veins.

Strapped to a specially
designed table, Evans finished a
brief statement and closed his
eyes. ’’I’m sorry,” he said, took
several shallow breaths and died.

Evans died for the brutal
robbery—murder of a Dallas
church pianist, a crime that took
place a few months after Gary
Gilmore’sJan. 17, 1977, death by
firing squad ended a 10-year na-
tional moratorium on executions.
I In the 10 years from Gilmore’s

, noisy death to Evans’ quiet end

last month, 66 men and one.

woman have been put to death.
In the years to come, Death Row,
U.S.A. is likely to become more
entrenched, more routine and
more efficient in the numbers it

sends to the executioner.

Today, the U.S. death row
population is four times as large
as it was in 1977. Constitutional
questions about capital punish-
ment have become a body of law
crowding federal court dockets.
Florida has established a special
office to handle death appeals;
Texas has built a factory to keep
death row inmates busy.

Yet debate over the death
penalty has quieted. Despite ar-
guments about its fairness and ef-
fectiveness, 86 percent of the
people questioned in a new Me-
dia General-Associated Press poll
favored the death penalty.

Only 33 percent saw its main
objective as deterring crime. Fifty
percent didn't believe death sen-

tences were handed out fairly.

Even opponents believe capital
punishment will be with us
through the next generation.

”We live in a culture that is in
a very bad mood,” said Henry
Schwarzschild, head of the
American Civil Liberties Union's
Capital Punishment Project.
”People no longer want the death
penalty as an answer to crime
and violence. They want it be-
cause they think the son of a bitch
should die.”

Death row’s population is
booming: When Gary Gilmore
died, 460 people were under
"death sentence; today, 1,838
await execution in 33 states.

Hampshire, Vermont and South _

Dakota, have not convicted any-
one under their death penalty sta-
tutes. Thirteen states have no
death penalties.

The rate of growth, an average
of 250 new prisoners a year,
shows no signs of slowing.

Florida adds an average of two
inmates a month to its death row,
the nation's largest with 259 in-
mates. Ten years ago, the popu-
lation was 82. Although 16 men
have died in the state's electric
chair, the stream of new’ inmates
has strained the system.

Texas, with 242 inmates, has
some 70 murder trials under way
where the death penalty is
sought. It has executed 20 men
since 1982. California, with 204
on death row, adds three inmates
a month. Its last execution was in
1967. /

A The number of death sentences

being handed down. is even
higher than reflected by prison
populations.

From 1977 to 1985, 2,110 per-
sons were sentenced to die, while
889 left death row after winning
rfew trials or resentencingfrom
state and federal courts.

The Supreme Court has issued
some two dozen death penalty
edicts in the past 10 years, mak-

_ ing it one of_the premier constitu-

tional issues of the decade.

Lower courts are swamped
with death row appeals.

John Charles Boger, head of the
NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund's efforts for
death row inmates, used to tell at-
torneys they could read all capi-

,tal punishment cases in a

weekend. .
”Now I'm not sure if you start-
ed in January you could know it
all by June,” he said.
Ten years ago, six of 10 death

Major constitutional issues
used for appeals are becoming
scarce as the Supreme Court rules
on more and more cases.

”As_ the body of case law con-
tinues to grow, we lose some is-
sues, and that cuts off avenues to
pursue,” said Tanya Coke, direc-
tor for research for the NAACP—
defense fund. ,

After some Florida inmates fac-
ing execution dates could not get
representation, the state legisla-
ture last year created an
$850,000 state Office of Capital
Collateral Representative to han-
dle appeals.

The hectic legal maneuverings
are far removed from those
whose lives hang in the balance.

James ”Doug” McCray has
been on Florida's death row near-
ly 13 years for the rape and beat-
ing death of a 67-year-old‘
woman. McCray once won a
new trial, only to see the decision
overturned.

Through years of legal battles,
he has met only one of three at-
torneys who represented him. He
said inmates often learn of their
cases from television.

”You become nothing more
than a piece of paper which has
a story to it," he said. ”Often
times that story is very ugly.”

 
   
 

 
       
   

Gilmore

movie of the same name.

Many lives were changed by
Gary Gilmore, whose notoriety
obscured his crimes.

In the summer of 1976, three
months after serving 11 years for
armed robbery, Gilmore robbed
and killed Orem service station
attendant Max Jensen and Provo
motel manager Bennie Bushnell
on consecutive nights, July 21
and 22.

The victims, 24 and 25 years
old respectively, were ordered to
lie down before being shot in the
head. Both were students at
Brigham Young University and
both left widows with infant
children.

”It is a lonely nightmare, and

"there's no other way to describe

it,” Mrs. Bushnell said. ”I was
widowed at 24, but I might as
well have been 80. I really went
through the ringer.”

Mrs. Bushnell said Gilmore’s
death ”didn’t make things right
with me,” but she is better off
than families of murder victims
who must endure. years of ap-
peals by killers.

Gilmore committed the mur-

ders in a rage over the breakup
of his romance with Nicole Bak-
er, a pretty, thrice—married mother
of ‘ two.

For years, Gilmore’s uncle,
Vern Damico, dreamed about the
execution his nephew asked him
to attend. ’’I could hear those ri-
fles going off so many times you
wouldn't believe,” he says now‘.

Damico, who smuggled Gil-
more some mini—bottles of bour-
bon on the eve of the execution,
said the condemned man knew
he deserved to die and wanted to
prove he could accept punish-
ment like a man.

Nicole Baker, now 30, is trying

to forget her former lover,
without much success.
' ”I have a tendency to think
about Gary, about how it might
have been,” she said in‘ an in-
terview.

Although forgiving of her many
past loves, Gilmore was wildly
jealous of any but him in her fu-
ture. When the couple reconciled
after the murders, Gilmore per-
suaded her to slip him sleeping

- pills and join him in a suicide

pact. -
A friend found Baker comatose

at her apartment. She was com-
mitted to a mental hospital until
after the execution. Gilmore,
more easily revived, tried suicide
again a month before his exe-
cution. 1

After Gilmore, it was two years
before the next inmate was ex-
ecuted; Florida murderer John
Spenkelink had exhausted all his
appeals. Sixty—six others have fol-
lowed. Meantime, the nation's
death row population has more
than quadrupled to over 1,800.

The morning of his death, as
Gilmore was about to be escort-
ed from the maximum—security
unit, he yelled to two fellow mur-
derers: ”Be seeing you directly.”
Many at the time thought he
would.

But today, Dale Selby and Wil— -

liam Andrews have completed
their 12th year on death row for
the torture-murders of three peo-
ple during a robbery in 1974.

As the pair wait out their
seventh and possibly final ap-
peals, corrections officials are
preparing a new site at the prison
for Utah's first executions since
Gilmore.

Pitt-Duquesne: An ode to a dying rivalry

Once upon a time there burned
a fiery rivalry in Pittsburgh. Pitt
vs. Duquesne, complete with
plenty of media primer, treasured
student bragging rights and more
fantastic finishes than ALCOA
could ever envision. It was in-
deed a bona fide basketball ex-
travaganza when the Panthers
and Dukes stepped onto the
court.

Sixteen times these annual bat-
tles were decided by a bucket or

less. Pitt-Duquesne, not so long
ago, was a crucial part of the ci-
ty's athletic tradition; it was won-
derful for the basketball world
itself. Pittsburghers loved it to
death.

Now it is all but dead, resting
quietly in the memories of those
who can recall the olden, some-
times golden, days.

Recently, the feuding couple
has split -— the two headed in
diffe/rent directions. Pitt has

cracked the Top 20 with its All-
America lineup, while the Dukes
are fighting just to end their sea-
son with _more wins than losses.

You've all heard it before — play .

for pride, fellas. We've got noth-
ing to lose.

Sadly enough, this so-called
rivalry is nothing more than an
everyday basketball game be-
tween two schools which, in
terms of locale, aren't that far
apart. Oh, they'll still schedule
the games. Tradition, that sort of
thing. But to those who can
remember, something will be
missing.’ .

Monday night at the Arena, Pitt

there have been lopsided victo-
ries in the series. In 1966, Du-
quesne trounced the Panthers by
34 points. But no team has ever
won eight straight from the other,
as Pitt has. The Panthers are pull-
ing away, and the Dukes may
never agaigi catch up.

on, but for outclassed Duquesne,
there wasn't all that much. to

win,
102-77

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt's 102-77 victory’ over
Duquesne was nothing more
than a game of spurts. There
were spurts of incessant foul-
ing, spurts of Panther fast-
break scoring, spurts of defen-
sive breakdowns from both
sides and Pat Cavanaugh
spurting up the court as Pitt's
new but shaky point guard.’

Pitt won its 1 1th game of the
season, but boy-oh-boy, "it
wasn't one to be dipped, or as
Charles Smith would ‘say,
dunked, in bronze."

”Things got pretty sloppy
out there at, times. But we
knew they'd [Duquesne]_ be
aggressive,” Smith said. ”We’
knew they wouldn't back
down.’-"

The Dukes gave the 7,923

-on hand an early reason to
gasp, jumping out to a 7-0
lead. But, much to Duquesne
coach‘ Jim Satalin’s obvious
displeasure, it was his team's
last gasp as the Panthers
churned ,out nine straight-
points and then coasted to a
46-35 halftime lead.

Perhaps the most interesting
aspect of the first half came
from the Pitt bench and Paul
Evans -- the traditional
”Changing of the Guard,” in
a sense. But this was the Civic
Arena not Buckingham Palace.
And the new guard was none
other than

J shots that eventually opened

the walk-on _

Cavanaugh, who entered the
game after a hurried Mike
Goodson shot, but then'didn’t
leave his post until the game's
final buzzer.

It was a job well done, too..
Cavanaugh quickly hit two

up the key and the second half
for Smith. »

”Coach told me to take it if
they were laying back,” said
Cavanaugh. ”Then when they
finally did come out, I could

- get it in to Char|esl”'

Smith, who poured in a
game—high 27 points, came
alive in the final 20 minutes,
but gave most of the credit to
his teammates.

’’I thought in the second half
things would open up more,”
he admitted. ”We got our fast
break going, and guys started
hitting the open shots.” J

' Pittsburgh's All-America
center also grabbed a career-
-high 17 rebounds, 10 away
from the defensive boards.

Duquesne was led by Tony

Petrarca’s 22 points, 18 of
which came from beyond the
three-point line.
. Curtis Aiken and Jerome
Lane also scored big for_ Pitt,
racking up 20 and 21 points,

— respectively.

The Dukes were badly out-‘
rebounded by the aggressive
Panthers, many times getting
only one shot out of a posses-
sion. , .

Indeed, it was a grand mar-
gin of victory and Paul Evans
was happy with the outcome
— but far from ecstatic about
the team's overall effort.

”The guard play was better.
Defensively, we played a
good man-to-man, but we
made a lot of mistakes,” he

At the 13:29 mark of the first
half of Monday night's Pitt-
Duquesne game, Panther walk-
on Pat Cavanaugh checked into
the line-up. ‘

He sat down 32 minutes.

" In that length of playing time,
the 6-2 freshman guard from

pleasant surprise for Pitt. He
scored eight points and grabbed
six rebounds. More importantly,

Cavanaugh. ”We’re a better team

I'm a scrappy, Boston
Celtic-type of player.

— Pat Cavanaugh A

Duquesne coach Jim Satalin
must be asking himself, ”Who
was that guy?” At first glance,
Cavanaugh appears to be a play-
er who can't run, can't shoot and
just can't play. But after the game,
you know Cavanaugh has con-
tributed. All you have to do is
take a look at the box score.

Cavanaugh is a low—key in-
dividual, but he is very confident
in his ability as a player. ’’I knew
that I could play on this level, but

I didn't know exactly when,” saidja

Cavanaugh. ’’I’m a scrappy, Bos-
ton Celtic-type of player. I'm not
flashy, but if I get the job done,

' then I'm effective.”

The question now is, ”What

son, Pitt's regular point guard, -

majority of the game. Evans ex-
plained: ” Right now, I’m- not

too cautious. He'll be OK when

THE ‘PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 14,1987

Holmanadding bench Strengh for Bruce 

By Kelley Butt

Assistant News Editor

Part of being a college basket-
ball player includes being able to
handle the recognition  or the
lack of it. We read about the
Charles Smiths, the Craig Hey-
wards and the Lee McReaS, but
the players whom are not as well
known are also an important part
of their teams. .

Although she has only been
averaging 8.5 minutes per game,
Lady Panther roundballer Amy
Holman is still very much a team
player.

The Middletown, Pa., native, in
her second season with the wom-
en's basketball team, has yet to
start a game. However, she
couldn't be happier.

”When I decided to come to
Pitt, it wasn't just the basketball
program that attracted me,” said
Holman. ”I liked the excellent
academic reputation and wanted
the big—schoo| experience.”

Holman also pointed out, ”My
parents and younger sisters
helped make the decision to
come to Pitt easier for me.

said. ”The defense lacks con-

sistency. Petrarca was able to hurt

Us in the first half. He scored rea|- -

They're a very stabilizing in-
fluence in my life. They're con-
cerned with me. It isn't simply a
matter of how well I played or
even ifl played. It's a no pressure
situation and that's nice.”

Holman, a communication dis-
orders major, quickly found that
she had to learn to budget her
time. Holman Said, ”I know that
there are certain things that I have
to get done. It's simply a matter
of using my time well.”

Academics weren't the only ad-
justment Holman found herself
being forced to make. There is a
significant difference between
high school and college basket-
ball. NCAA Division I teams play
tough teams. These teams field
five good players. Being good
simply isn't enough. It takes more
than raw talent to have a Success-
ful college care_er.

Holman stated, ”SometimeS, it
is very frustrating for me to not
play the entire game. I've gone
from starting four years in high
school to this. But, I still work my
hardest and I still have to pay my
time and wait my turn here at Pitt.

problems, Shanahan Shot merely
38 percent from the field. Start-
ing center Jim Balog scored not
a point, while the Duquesne
bench was only good for four,
and the Dukes fell to 6-8.
Panther coach Paul Evans him-

self even admitted, ”We don't"

feel any rivalry between the two
schools. You guys [the media] try
to create that sort of thing. We

ly well, but we were concentrat-
ing on stopping [Emmett]
Sellers.”

If there are any unpleasant

I feel that I'm good enough to be
[here].”

Coach Kirk Bruce stated, ”I
know that Amy's minutes aren't

there, but that's a judgment call‘

on the coach's part. I want her to
feel that she's good enough to be
out there, because she is.”

As her career progresses, Hol-
man notes that it ”  is getting
easier. As A a freshman it was
tough. It's a little easier now be-
cause I’ve made some improve-
ment. I still have some work to do
though.”

Holman thinks thather strong
suit includes her offensive abili-
ties. ”I want to improve my
defense. I feel that's the part of
my game that holds me off the
court. As far as the team.’s goals
are concerned, they're intangible.
My purpose, when I've earned
playing time, is to shoot the ball,’’
she said.

Coach Bruce said, ”Amy is
right on target. She's willing to
take a good, long look at her
game and try to make improve-
ments. She gives her best effort
and that is all I can ask of any of
my players.”

prepare for this game like we
would any other.”

Who knows? Maybe things will
change underjim Satalin. Maybe
Duquesne will eventually regain
its lofty status of the past. But for
now,_the old Pitt-Duquesne has
passed away, hidden in the
record books. Not so far from a
crude, cold burial — but miles
away from true resurrection.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 14, 1987

Some thoughts from a winter of
contentment:

0 The college bowls are all be-
hind us now,’ and it's a good time
to pause for a moment and con-
sider what we have learned from
them. Nothing, you say. I think
we learned plenty.‘ We were
reminded that crime doesn't pay.
Not for Al Capone, not for the
Joker and not for the Miami Hur-
ricons.

Brian Bosworth was right when
he said playing Miami was play-
ing ”the University of San Quen-
tin.” From long-distance phone
scams to assualt, the ’Cons would
have kept Crockett and Tubbs
busy for half a season's worth of
episodes this year.

0 Ever notice -Jimmy Johnson
has trouble running up thescore

in bowl games. That's probably
because his team has trouble
scoring in bowl games.

0 We also learned that Earle
Bruce looks silly in a suit and hat,
that the Holiday Bowl is still ex-
citing, although not quite the

same without BYU, that the Cot—_

ton Bowl is basically ignored out-
side a 100-mile radius of Dallas
and that’ the Orange Bowl hal-
ftime show is better than half of
the football games played this
yeah

0 Theory No. 439 as to why
the Big 10 representative can
never win the Rose Bowl: Big 10
teams rarely, if at all, play on a
grass field during the season.
Ross—Ade Stadium in West Lafay-
ette, lnd., is the only Big 10 stadi-
um still using a natural surface.

 

BOB rnnvans

So when a team like Michigan
plays Purdue at home and sched-
ules, say Oklahoma and Wash-
ington as its two non-league
games, it can go into the Rose
Bowl with no experience on
grass. And practicing on grass a
few weeks before the bowl is a

poor substitute for actual games.
Hey, it's only a theory.
0 I think Joe Paterno is the
greatest thing since bubblegum.
What is it with this massive in-
feriority complex Pitt fans seem
to have when it comes to Penn

, State? Could it be thatisome Pitt

to j
u at

backers resent the squeaky-clean
image Penn State projects, not to
mention the huge success it has
had under Paterno? ‘ '

Maybe Pitt should wear green
uniforms when they play the Nit-
tany Lions. For all you non—CAS
students out there, that's green as
in jealousy.

0 The best off-season move so
far was made by Purdue in hiring
Fred Akers as coach. When he
was at the University of Texas,
Akers’ teams usually won but did
not go to the Cotton Bowl every
year. That was not good enough
for the UT administration, which
fired Akers last month. What is
most impressive about Akers is
that his program was not placed
on probation. And in the South-
west Conference, it’s almost as
tough to stay off probationlas it
is to find your way around Forbes
Quad. Almost.

0 The Major League Baseball
Players Association has filed a
lawsuit charging the baseball
owners are colluding to keep free
agents from signing million—dollar_
contracts the way they did only

Chew on this — Paterno better than gum

a few years ago. The owners say
they are not. If you believe the
owners, I would like to talk to
you about a bridge I own. It's for
sale. Connects Brooklyn to Man-
hattan 

0 The Pirates finished 9,000
games out of first place last year.
Tony Pena has one year left on
his contract and has indicated
that he is probably going to look
elsewhere to play when it ex-
pires, and yet the Pirates refused
to trade him.

Instead they wanted to ditch
Johnny Ray and replace him with
a player who hit .263 in Double
A last season. Lose Pena now,
while he can still. bring something
in the trade market. Mike Diaz,
who should play every day, can
catch.

0Memo to Pirates General '

Manager Syd Thrift: Get some
pitching!

0 Just because Pitt's basketball
team isn't as good as most of us
thought they were doesn't mean
they still can't win the Big East.

What that means is the Big East
isn't too_ good this year.

Sack-master Taylor talks about his trade

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK (AP). ~ T0 line-
backer Lawrence Taylor, the Na-
tional Football League's Most
Valuable Player, there are two
kinds of quarterback sacks.

”There are sacks,” the New
York Giants’ star said Tuesday,
”and there are SACKS.”

Then he explained
difference.

’’It depends on how you hit
him,” Taylor said. ’’If you run up
from behind and the guy's not
watching and you have a chance
to put your helmet into him and
 the coach comes out and asks
if he's all right, that's a SACK.”

Taylor led the league this sea-
son in the combined statistic,
recording 20 of them, some sacks
and some SACKS. Thatis second
highest total since the NFL began
keeping track of them. They

the

helped make him the first defen- ~

sive player to win MVP honors in
the dozen years that the Pro Foot-
ball Writers Association have
been presenting the award.
Taylor also was named MVP

Evans echoed those sentiments.

”I told Pat to be ready, and since '

he was having a good game, I
wanted to bolster his confidence,
so I left him in. The only thing
that worries‘ me is that if we do
not get consistent play from the
point, it may keep us from great-
ness. We've got four good ath-
letes, and we need a good point

month, joining Alan Page of the
Minnesota Vikings as the only
defensive players to be named
MVP by the AP’s panel of ‘sports
broadcasters and writers.

”This trophy should have
(Coach) Bill Parcells name along-
side mine,” Taylor said of the ‘
award he received Tuesday. ”He
helped me more than anybody
this season. He gave me the
strength and the means necessary
to win.”

It was Parcells who eased Tay-
|or’s return to the Giants after off-
season rehabilitation from
unspecified substance abuse.
’’Bill did a lot for me. He let me
be myself, do what I had to do.
He gave me a lot of leeway.”

Taylor said the Giants’ opening
game loss to Dallas helped set the
tone for the New York's NFC
championship season. ”We
thought nobody could run on us
and we thought nobody could
pass on us,” he said. ”We got real
cocky. We had played well in the
preseason. The defense was total-

The Panthers needed a shot in
the arm, and they got one from
Cavanaugh, who came to Pitt
from West Point Prep. And that
made it all the more appropriate
— having a man from the military

offense. '

When Pitt's No. I diver Tricia
Ney had to redshirt this season
due to a knee problem, the re-
maining women divers were left
with a big pair of shoes to ‘fill.

”It is the mark of a good team
when the No. I diver is out of the
line-up, and the other divers can
fill the gap,” said women's div-
ing coach Julian Krug.

Sophomore Margie Paulick, a
native of Bethel Park, has been
instrumental in filling this gap. Af-
ter a tough and dedicated sum-
mer of training, Paulick was
ready to fill the void Ney had left.

Paulick has experienced a great
deal of success as a Pitt diver this.
season, most notably a win on
both boards. at the competitive
Pitt Christmas Invitational-

She is also the only female
diver at Pitt thus far this season to
qualify for the NCAA pre-
qualifying meet in March.

Paulick likes being the No. 1
diver for Pitt's women's team, es-
pecially since she only is a sopho-
more. She doesn't, however, take
this position or her success for
granted. ‘

”I am definitely not content to
stay at the level of diving I am at
right now,” said Paulick. ”There
is so much more I want to accom-
plish in diving. If I were to quit
working now, my spot as the No.
I diver would change quickly be-
cause there is a lot of talent on
our team. On any given day any-
one can be in the top positon.”

[Diving] provides me
with something to fo-
cus on.

—iMargie Paulick

Krug points out that Paulick is
struggling through a tough part of
the season right now, in that her
dives are off, and_ her confidence
is low. However, he is quick to
remind that this is a stage inher-
ent to the peaking process and
that most divers experience it at
least once during any given sea-
son. The older and more ex-
perienced a diver is, the easier it
is for him to accept and work
through this trying stage.

”The peaking process is psy-
chological as well as physical,”
said Krug. "Right now, Paulick is
not feeling very confident about
herself. She doesn't feel she is as

far ahead as she would like to be.

at this point in the season.

’’I am confident, though, that
when the time comes she will be
there, and she will be tough. You
work harder when you are not
where you want to be. She did
not make it to the NCAA meet
last year, and it is definitely
tougher to break new ground
than to maintain it. .We have to
go considerably beyond where
we were last year if she is to do
well at the pre—qualifer and make
it to thechampionship meet. She
is definitely on the right track,
though.” »

This type of supportive attitude
is typical of Krug, whom Paulick
regards highly. ’ _

”I consider Julian one of my
best friends,” said Paulick. ”He
has helped me a lot as a person
and taught me almost everything
I know. He can give you a good,
swift kick in the butt if you need
it but at the same time be very
supportive.”

Along-with the support of a -

good coach and teammates,
strength is essential’ to a good
diver. It makes one quicker in the
air and stronger off the board.
With this in mind, Paulick has
been putting in extra hours in the
weight room with the women's
swim team as well as the diving
team. Aside from the obvious
gains in diving performance, she
states lifting makes her feel bet-
ter about herself as well.

As far as goals are concerned,
for the rest of this diving season
Paulick would like to improve
upon‘ the consistency of her
dives, keeping in mind the
thought of doing well at the
NCAA pre-qualifying meet. If she
places there in the top four, she
will advance to the NCAA diving
championships, where finishing
well would also please her.

Paulick intends to declare a
communications and psychology
dual major in the near future. She
attributes diving,
enough, to her academic success.

’’If I didn't participate in diving,
I wouldn't study as much,” said
Paulick. ’’I tend to procrastinate.
Divingdoes not leave me much
time, so I know I can't fool

‘around. I have to get things done

in a short period of time, or they
won't get done at all. It has real-
ly helped me structure my time.”
Paulick also said her participa-
tion in diving adds to the de-
velopment of personal qualities
she feels will help her be a suc-
cess outside of diving as well.
”Diving has taught me about

. discipline and a lot_about my-
self,” said Paulick. ”You do a lot, J

of growing up while you are on
the team as well as figuring out
your priorities. ‘
”Diving provides me with
something to focus on. I have

learned how to achieve goals and ’

how to discipline myself. It has
helped me realize that sometimes
you have to do certain things in
life because you have to do them
and not because you want to do
them.” I
