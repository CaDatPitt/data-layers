Fraternities Await Accept- -

mice or Rejection of Bids

 

This afternoon at 5 o’clock the
official silence period imposed on
fraternity men and rushees by the
University rushing rules will be
ended when bids submitted by Greek
letter organizations will be re-
turned either refused or accepted.

The week before this was one of
intense activity for fraternity men
and rushees while the official rusli-
ing period was in force. Beginning
9:30 a. in. on Thursday, February
6, rushing ended with the beginning
of the silence period, 2 a. m., Tues-
day morning, February 18. During
the period of silence bids were
transmitted to freshmen by the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men with the
preferential system in force. Today
at ﬁve the b..n will be lifted.

Under interfraternity rul i n g s
houses were permitted to hold a
total of ﬁve affairs for rushing pur-
poses. Most fraternities held the
limited number of affairs while sev-
eral conﬁned themselves to a small-
er number. On the whole “conser-
vativeness” was the keynote and
those houses which extended them-
ielves to the entire number of af-
fairs did so on a simple basis.

An eligibility list of freshmen
who had earned twelve credits with
twelve quality points, the pledging
requisite, was prepared by the of-
fice of the dean of men for the use
of fraternities in the present season.
In addition to this information the
religious preferences of students
was also indicated.

It is the unspoken opinion of fra-
ternity presidents and rushing
chairman the season just ended will
mark the continuation or ending of
the deferred ruling adopted by in-
terfraternity council two years ago.
Many complaints have been lodged
against the rules as they now stand,
but action has been deferred until
the close of the present rushing sea-
son. The deferred plan of rushing
will be aired at the next meeting of
interfraternity council scheduled for
the Phi Gamma Delta house Tues-
day, March 4. The rules can be
changed» only ..b.y 2; joint. ..act.ion::o.f_

CAP-GOWN F OEIs
RECOGNITION .

Cap and Gown was recognized
along with seven other college dra-
matic clubs for men in an article
entitled, “All Our Girls Are Men,”
in the March issue of the College
Humor Magazine, as having a. “sub-
stantial organization capable of
planning, building, producing and
playing a musical comedy as good
(and it is hoped, notas bad) as
some on no other street than Broad-
way in the city of New Yor ._”

Other clubs considered in the
lafticle were those of Princeton,

ichigan, Pennsylvania, Chicago,
Wisconsin, Harvard and Columbia.
The writer, Robert De Haven, ex-
plains how a typical show is pro-
duced, reveals prominent alumni of
the different organizations and
offers a brief history of each. .

He tells how in 1907 Dr. Ash-
brook, still president of the grad-
uate club, organized the club and
succeeded in producing “In Wup-
land” in three acts. Nineteen twent -
eight’s show, “Mary-Grow-Roun ,”
and 1929’s show, -“‘Yip-Y_1p,” are
written up in detail, giving the
casts and the settings. Mention is
made of the two hit tunes of last
year’s show: “That’s Why I Love
You,” by Gus Schnabel, and “My
Memories,” by Louis M. Fushan,.co—
author of this year’s production,
“Manhattan Preferred.”

if the recommendation made by
Student Council at its meeting,
Wednesday’ evening, receives the en-

The motion as passed by council
provides that staff heads of the four
publications shall have the privilege
of recommending their successors to
the board, and of taking an active
part in discussion of policies af-
fecting their particular publication.
In the opinion of council a more
accurate judgment could be made by
the student publications board ‘in
appointing staff heads by. having the
editor and businessmanagers pres-

discussion on the qualities of the
various candidates for staff posi-
tions. After considerable discussion
over the advisability of giving stu-
dent members of the board a voting
privilege, this proposal was stricken.‘
from the recommendation‘ on
grounds that it would remove pro-
tection against favoritism.

Action taken by council was pre-
cipitated after a report on the ad-'
visability of making the position of

sition, given by Fred Lucas and

Chaser, ” Leaves

Soon For Coastal Eclipse

 

Dr. Heber D. Curtis, director of

Allegheny observatory at the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh, will leave in
the latter part of March for the Pa-
ciﬁc Coast and expects to make.ob-
servations of the total solar eclipse
next April 28. He will visit the ob-
servatories at Flagstaﬂ’, Mt. Wilscn
and Lick Observatory at Mt. Hamil-

_ton, California, en route. -

It is his present ‘plan to moto
out and back, in company_with Mrs.
Curtis and his son, Baldwin, return-
ing about May -15. ‘ ‘_

The eclipse of April 28 is a cum-
ous one. Generally a total eclifpse
of the sun will last from one to ve
minutes, and only very _rarely will
it be as long as seven minutes.‘ This
eclipse, however, almost misses be-
ing an eclipse at all. It starts out
over the Paciﬁc Ocean as_an annular
eclipse (that is, an eclipse where
the moon does not completely cover
the sun) and changes to a total
eclipse before reaching California.

and then changes to annular form
once more.

Because of this peculiarity, it is
about as short as a total eclipse can
be and still be an eclipse; the max-
imum duration of its totality is only
one second and a half! Such an
eclipse is, of course, practically use-
less for ordinary photographic or
pictorial work. It is quite favora-
ble, however, for certain highly
technical observations, known as the
photography of the “ﬂash” spectrum

will attempt. V

Because of its brief duration, the
shadow path is very narrow, only
about a half a mile wide, and the as-

COUNClL’S AIM

In an effort to strengthen the po-
sition of fraternities as a co-func-
tioning campus unit, Harry Porter
Col. ’30, president of Delta Tau
Delta, and head of interi'raternit—y

 

council, has appointed a recommeii- .

dations committee, which will sug-
gest points for improvement and in-
creased activities. Carl H. 1 Voss,
Col. ’32, Sigma‘ Alpha Epsilon,
junior representative in council, is
chairman of the committee.

Others on the committee ~arel
Stewart Hornet, Dent. ’3.‘.’, Sigma
Chi, and Morris Naurnoif, Bus. Ad.
’3l, Sigma Alpha Mu. Voss has al-
ready interviewed Theodore Biddle,
assistant dean of men, and Profes-
sor Robert D. Ayars, a faculty mem-
ber of the fraternity committee, am.-
both have expressed interest and
encouiagement for the matter. _

Mr, Biddle’s opinion was worded
thus: “The work of the committee
may be very indefinite at ﬁrst, but
whatever it can and will do, will be
realized and appreciated in the end.
’l'liere is opportunity for improve-
ment in the work of interfratermt):
council. ’ The council should be-
come a more potent factor in Uni-
versity life.” '

Professor Ayars’ talk with Voss
brought out his hearty approval of
the plan, even though it Will Seem
riui.te.diilicult to get suggestions at
first. .

Voss, whose other activities in-
clude chairmanship; of the _sophomore
hop, membership in Druids, honor-
ary activities fraternity; sub—chair-
manship of men’s Cathedral com-
mittee, and vice presidency of Sigma

Alpha Epsilon, is already at work~

with the committee. He will also
interview Robert C. Clothier, dean
of men, and Miss Helen Poole Rush,
assistant dean of women.

One suggestion has already been
brought up and will be presented
as :1 recommendation to-interfrater-
nity council at its March meeting.
It would provide for an interfra_ter-
nity smoker in February,‘ the night
before regulation rushing season
opened, to which . all prospective
rushees would be invited.

At such an affair each frater-
nity represeiited would meet with
rushees and arrange engagements
during the season.

MED. GRADUATES
  HEAD SCHOOL  

By G. B. PEARSON,‘

Dr. Harold A. Miller, professor of
obstetrics, is dean of the Pitt alumni
of the faculty of the School of Med-*
icine. Dr. Miller received his doctor-
ate of medicine in 1899. Until 1903
he was engaged in_ general practice,
then going to’ Heidelberg to study
obstetrics under Leon von Rosthorn.
Upon his‘ return, he became obstetri-

 

 

pital. In 1908 he_was appointed pro_-
fessor of obstetrics and served until
1912. In 1920 Dr. Miller was reap-
pointed. At the present he_is chief
of staff of the Magee Hospital. He
is past president of the Allegheny
County Medical Society and of the
Pittsburgh Academy of Medicine.
Dr. Miller says, concerning the

with me in the’obstetric department
are Dr. Charles E. Zie_gler, Dr.
Charles Barone, Dr. Paul Dodds, Dr.
D. B. Martinez, and Dr. Morris
Hodgson. The department as a
whole covers about_twenty per cent
of the births in Pittsburgh. Each
senior, student has at the time of his
graduation thirtyito forty actual de-
liveries to his credit, a number much
in excess of the average school and
exceeded by none in the United
States. Magee Hospital is the larg-
est purely woman’s hospital in the
United States. It has three thousand.
deliveries per year, in addition to
prenatal clinics, post-mortem clinics,
seven weekly clinics operated in dif-
ferent parts of Pittsburgh, and gyn-

tains a full staff of consulting phy-
sicians in other lines, complete path-
ological and chemical laboratories
and an X-ray department. It has a
research committee composed of the
department heads of the School of
Medicine which is now studying the
questions of -eclampsia and puerpal
sepsis.” _

Dr. Miller is also on the staffs of
the Sewickley General Hospital and

Dr. William S. McEllroy, '16,
youngest professor on the faculty of
the School of Medicine, received his
Batchelor of Science degree from
Pitt in 1914, his Doctor of Medicine
degree in 1916. While in school he
was student assistant in physiology
and pharmecology, under Dr. C. C.
Guthrie, head of that department.
Upon graduation, Dr. McEllroy went
to Harvard, where he did» graduate
work under Professor Otto Folin. A
result is the Folin-McEllroy’s test
for sugars in urine, a delicate qual-
itative test. s

SOPHOMORES TO
  TAKE EXAMS

A comprehensive examination will
be given to sophomore students of
Pennsylvania colleges in the latter
part of April. This examination,
which was presented to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh by Dr. Walter,
Jones of the Research division "in
Higher Education has been ap-
proved by the deans of the various
undergraduate schools. ‘The ' exami-
nation was originally proposed by
the Study of the Itelations of Sec-
ondary and Higher Education, which
is sponsored by the Association of

the State department of‘Public‘In-
struction. j ~ .

I The exa.inination- deals with sub-
jects which are commonly elected in
college. All sophomore. students will
be required to ~ta.k'e' the .examina-.
tion in English, Matliematics «For-
eign Literature, Fine Artsiaiid Gen-
eral History. An intelligence test-
will also‘ be administered to all par-
ticipants. A
Permit Options '

V However, in" each of the ﬁelds of
foreign languages, natural science
and social science, the student will
have the option of selecting one sub-
ject in which to beexamined. This
examination is expected to require
three five-hour sessions, but the ex-
act dates for holding the tests have
not yet _been_ chosen. .

This procedure has several pur-
poses: It is desired ﬁrst to discover
how V consistently a student main-
tains the quality of his educational
achievement. Secondly, it is desired
to have fuller information about
students leaving college before
graduation. Third, it is‘ hoped by
studying teacher's ratings of stu-
dents side by side with scores se-
cured by them in objective examina-
tions to throw light on the problem
of appraising student achievement.
Fourth, the use. of these tests is ex-
pected to aid in bringing education

to ‘more effective basis than hereto-
fore.

The first delivery of some of the
625 tons of structural steel to be
used in erecting the Falk Clinic is
now scheduled for about March 1.
Contracts for stone erection and
electrical work have been awarded
and bids for all plumbing work are
out. The Iron City Engineering
Company has the contract for all
electrical work on the Clinic.
Twenty-four thousand cubic feet
of Indiana limestone will be needed
for the walls. This amount is almost
one-tenth of the amount necessary
for the Cathedral of Learning. The
stone will be backed with tile.‘ Brass
plumbing for water lines will be
used throughout the building. A
unique feature of the Clinic plumb-
ing is that it is a one-pipe system.
Tempered .water, neither hot nor

. cold, will flow from all faucets with

the exception of those in the
kitcliens-. Separate heating units
will provide‘ the boiling water or
steam that will be necessary for the
sterilization of instruments.
