Building Program Hits War Snag

Underpaid Profs Still
In Dark on Wage Hike

B)’ ED JENSEN

The question of a salary boost for the University’s 1402
faculty members remained up in the air today.

So far the professors have gone on record as more than just
favorable to an increase in take-home pay. They formally express-
ed their stand in a report submitted to the administration last
Friday when the University Senate met in a closed-door session

in the Chancellor’s chambers,

_ Favored 8% Bqost

. While not mentioning any speci-
fic figure the Senate, which repre-
sents the entire faculty, is believ-
ed to favor a general 8 per cent
increase each year for a three-year
period. At the end of three years
they would be getting 24 per cent
more than their present salaries.
This same increase was recom-
mended by the group last year and
a slight boost resulted.

The Senate report outlined the
upward curve of the cost of living
index in the Pittsburgh district
and the smaller arc of professors’
salaries in pursuit. According to
the report the index shows a
75.9 increase over 1940.

In the same 11 year period the
average professor’s salary increas-
ed only 35.95 per cent. Other in-
creases were: associate professor,
31.3 per cent; assistant professors
31.85, and for the instructors, 61.1
the report revealed.

Willing, But

Chancellor Rufus ll. Fitzgerald,
chairman of the Senate, said the
the administration is willing to
increase the salaries, but its
willingness is tempered by sever-
al hard financial facts of life. The
chief consideration, he pointed
out, is the enrollment figure.

Citing the fact that enrollment
has already dropped 13 per cent
and that next year’s enrollment is
expected to drop still further, he
said that the University cannot
make any definite statement at
the moment.

About 55 per cent of the Univer-
sity’s income is derived from tui-

tion. The ability to pay is based
largely on the tuition income,
which is uncertain due to the draft
situation, the Chancellor Fitz-
gerald said.

Salary vs. Morale
In the report of the Senate at-
tention was called to the impor-
tance to the school of an “ade-
quate salary.”
“In our opinion the growth of
a great educational institution
is dependent upon the develop-
ment of a faculty of high com-
petence, reasonable stability
and high morale. This cannot
be achieved without a salary
scale and a teaching load which
attract and keep able scholars.”
the report declared.

Student Union, Library and Gym

By BOB THOMAS ‘

Korea, the draft, government regulations, and lack of money
all have struck at Pitt again - this time hitting the school in its
$12,700,000 building expansion program.

In an interview Monday, Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald re-
vealed that the proposed student union, library, and gymnasium

which were to have gone up on the
Cathedral campus probably will
not be built at the present time.
He did, however, say that the
University intends to push con-
struction on the medical center,
the field house, and the George
Hubbard Clapp Science Hall.
These structures, the Chancellor
said, are the ones which the Uni-
versity needs most right now.

Drive Began in '48
The huge expansion program
was announced by Alan M. Scaife,
chairman of the drive, in June,
1948. Since then more than
$9,500,000 has been raised, in-
,cluding an anonymous $3,000,000
gift towards the medical center.
Summarized, this is what the
Chancellor had to say about the
six major parts of the building
program:
1. The medical center —— While

the cost has risen far past the
original $6,500,000 estimate, the
center will be built to fill a need
which has existed since 1929.

2. Student Union There is
some question as to whether we
could go ahead with a recreational
building such as the student union
under present government regula-
tions.

3. Science Hall -— There is a
definite need for a science build-
ing, said Fitzgerald. Primarily
it will be constructed for expanded
research operations which are
expected to grow even bigger in
the future. Possibly, also, the
metallurgical and chemical engi-
neering departments will be hous-
ed in the building.

Field House Vital
Field House Chancellor

Fitzgerald saw no reason why

Put in Cold Storage for Duration

construction on the field house
would be stopped. He hopes that
it can be used as a part of the
conditioning program which might
be needed under wartime condi-
tions -- if and when they arrive.

5. Library -- “At the present
time,” said Fitzgerald, “I don't
think we will go ahead with plans
for a library building.” Lack of
funds are one of the big impedi-
ments in the path of its construc-
tion.

6. Gymnasium -- Probably due
to government regulations, the
gym will not be built at present.
Chancellor Fitzgerald said that to
the best of his knowledge the gym
could not be built unless it was
proved that it would be used for
physical education only. However,
some of the facilities which were
to have gone into the gym have
been transferred to the field house.

Research Gets Priority
Primarily, those structures
which will be emphasized will be

connected with research -- the
medical center and the Science
Hall. As Chancellor Fitzgerald

Frosh Men Favor Drafting 18

B)’ ED MURPHY
More Pitt freshmen men appear to be in favor of drafting 18
year olds, than congressional bigwigs.
In a poll by the Pitt News conducted in the; freshman English

1 courses the students polled voted
three to one to draft 18 year olds.
Veterans, the smallest oftheir group
to register since 1946, voted six to
one in favor of the proposal.

More than 49% of the freshmen
polled were l8 years old. Nineteen
per cent of the frosh were 17.

Engineers Before Artists
On the question of drafting non-
technical students before technical
students, again the men frosh voted
three to one in favor of such a pro-

posal. Veterans were in greater dis-

aggreement over this question. They
voted only four to three in favor.
The frosh widely differed on the
length of service a draftee should
serve. The preference ranged from
18 months or less to thirty months.
Most voted for l8 months or less
while 36 per cent of the polled men
saidthey thought 18 months was long
enough. Thirty per cent felt 24 months
was the proper length of service.
The majority of the veterans, most
of whom are over 26 years old, felt

18 months was the satisfactory

le ngth of service.

Plan Return to College

The polled students were almost
unanimous in saying they would re-
turn to college even if they had to
serve two years in the armed ser-
vices. Vets expressed the same
opinion. -

When asked whether they would
rather serve two years in the armed
services first and then come to
college, or instead get as much edu-
cation as possible, be draftedfand
then come back to college, the ma-

jority of the men selected the latter
choice. Only a small percentage pre-
ferred serving their induction period
first.

Year Olds

Among the students polled Bus Ad
freshmen voted the most favorably
for the 18 year old draftee proposal,
voting 75% for it. Vets, engineering,
and college‘ frosh voted 73%, 71%,
and 63% respectively.

Blind Here
Get Tape

Recorder

By CLARK WILSON

Science via the Lions Club of
Vandergrift, Penna., has come
through with another boost to better
study conditions of blind students
attending Pitt.

To ease study problems of such
students, the club presented the
University with a tape recorder
valued at $650.

The equipment, located in the
library, is for the use of any blind
student interested. Arrangements
can be made at the circulation desk
on the fifth floor of the Cathedral,
said Dr. A. L. Robinson, University
librarian.

In addition to supplying the
machine, the club also provided the
initial reels of tape. Students using
the machine will furnish other reels
for their own use.

Recordings used on the machine
will include tape transcriptions of
standard books of collateral read-
ings and certain basic textbooks.
Paul Long, newscaster at KDKA,
has volunteered to make recordings
of several books. Other transcrip-
tions may be made by friends of the
individual student or by a hired
reader.

The Lions Club credited the
partially-blind pastor of the Murrays-
ville Presbyterian Church, the Rev.
George McCracken, with suggesting
the gift.

Venezuelan Graduate

Tells of Boom

One February graduate almost went to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology instead of coming to Pitt.

There’s nothing unusual about that, except that Archie
Gamboa traveled all the way from Venezuela to do it. Now that he
has received his B.'S. degree from Pitt's School of Mines, he’s not

sorry he was sent here.

Because he had never been in
the United States before coming to
Pitt, Archie entertained a few
strange ideas about North Ameri-
can customs. The 23 year old
metallurgy major says he was
pleasantly surprised to find Ame-
ricans so courteous and friendly.
In case you didn't know, South
American opinion has it that
Yankees are too busy making mo-
'ney to ever say "Pardon me” or
be nice to a stranger. Archie has
found Pittsburghers to be just the
opposite of that misconception.

American Life ‘Stable’

He was equally amazed by our
stable industrial life. Archie says
that, because of fantastic oil
booms and growing American in-
vestments, Venezuela has become
even more conscious of progress
than bustling Pittsburgh. He
claims that “we Venezuelans have
become so used to progress and
expansion that life up here seems

that the present University policy

However, "the committee does not

Finally, Congress was referred

University on the matter.

A Profs Deserve Raise

With inflation daily assuming the proportions of a night-
marish Topsy, it comes as no surprise that the faculty should
feel the need for a salary adjustment.

Restrained by a strong sense of responsibility, a total lack
of occupational organization and a close identification with the
University, they have withheld their demands until the immediate
facts of everyday living made delay disasterous.

A traditionally underpaid group they have been forced to live
on incomes which have always been several unhealthy steps be-
hind the cost of living. In order to keep their heads above the
flood of inflation they have been forced to devote more and
more of their energies to sideline occupations or to looking
for more lucrative jobs. It is a tribute to the University that

only 32 have left so far.

But it is obvious that a staff which must devote much of their
energies to earning extra money cannot render the kind of service
we have been accustomed to. Even more obvious is the fact that
the University cannot hold top men if it does not pay them enough

to make teaching here attractive.

So far loyalty has kept many of our underpaid instructors here.
Loyalty, however, can stand only so much strain, especially-
where it is in conflict with a decent standard of living.

We do not like to envision a staff of mediocrities, but we
think this can be the only result if no salary boost is forthcoming.

We do, however, realize that the Uni

financial future.

versity is faced with a grave

The present financial situation makes an immediate pay in-
crease inadvisable. With enrollment down and a greater drop ex-
pected, it is hard to see just where the money will come from.

While we don’t have any exact figures, we do feel that there
are some comers which can be cut. We hope the University will A
find them. The profs deserve a raise.

Vive Lo Reine!

DICK KOVAR

The few remarks made here are going to be mighty unpopular
in certain areas of the University, but somehow, we just don’t’

care.

We noted on page 1 today the annual University (women’s
division. that is) Rose Tea. at which eight worthy senior Women

were officially notified of their nom-
ination for Senior Queen.

The eight girls, we know, are all
top-drawer coeds, worthy in every
way of the University’s respect and
recognition. ,

It was odd, though, and somewhat
humiliating that the girls had to be
searched for under furniture and out-
side the windows. We got the im-
pression that maybe the nominees
weren't particularly eager to be nom-
inated.

Everything turned out all right, we
were relieved to discover, when the
searchers at length found each girl
standing in plain view. Perhaps the
searchers just wuen’t familiar with
the nominee s.

Sweetness and Light

With all the long—gowned young
ladies swooping to the floor in a
style the Duchess of Windsor might
be proud of, it was a very pretty cer-
emony for a while. The sweetness
and light, however, was carried on
to such great lengths that several of
those who had been commanded to
watch the goings-on _gagged and
were forced to leave before the
Joyce McClements (caterers by
Royal Command) goodies were dis-
tributed. These latter young women
will immediately be branded as sick
with envy and disappointment. May-
be they were. This particular type of
ceremony seems to inspire that in
the most modest of coeds.

With the grains of salt we have
taken before writing this grinding
between our molars, we will go on to
cheer the women for keeping sex ap-
peal out of the running in the Queen
nominations (though _it showed up
anyway), and for making the title of

Senior. Queen a more valuable one
than the typical beauty queens of
othercampuses.

Trimmings Cheapen Title

The ceremony and expense that
go with the hull abaloo of nominating
and crowning the queen, however,
all but submerges the intrinsic val-
ue of the title. The overdone imita-
tions of European royalty with which
the affair is surrounded turn a basic-
ally valuable idea of recognizing
outstanding women into a sickening
combination of hollow pomposity and
childish play-acting.

Such criticisms, of course, are
muttered out of the dean of women’s
earshot every spring, and we rarely
devote space to it out of the sheer
futility of it all.

But this year, with everyone from
the janitors to the deans crying for
more money, and everyone from the
Chancellor to the Owl business man-
ager crying for economy, the expense
of Miss Rush’s fuss and feathers
seems to be particularly outof Style
with the threadbare budgets ‘of the
academic departments.

We have tried before to ascertain
privately the total expense of the
annual preparation for and the cul-
mination of the Senior Queen cere-
mony without success. Wild guesses
have ranged as high as $5000, a
figure which we are sure (we hope)
is exaggerated.

Now we are asking publicly, in
the interests of the entire Univer-
sity, what the actual cost is, and
whether it is justified when consid-
ered with more pressing needs in
other areas of University endeavor.

Can anyone oblige us?

Everything is going up these days. -

Taxes are going up, prices are going up and wages are going
up. Tuition has gone~up and we hear that the trolley company, an
organization with a firm belief that progress is an upward moving
process, is again about to boost its fares. Even women’s dresses,

after swishing perilou, y near the
earth fora couple of years, are headed
that way.

It seems to be a trend and one
which willcontinue for quite a while.
All of the graduates up in Washington
are knocking themselves out trying
to reverse it, but so far they have
only succeededjin pushing upward
the personnel turnover in govern-
ment service. Like King Canute they
haven't been able to turn back the
tide.

Right here on campus we have a

group
joined the movement. Irefer, of course,

of progressives who have

Forbes St.eateries. They have served

Pitt Poll

  ISABEL LUBOVSKY

The Owl subscription campaign
has not gone over as well as was

expected. The senior class has
not given the yearbook enough
support. According to Jerry Simon,
Owl business manager, approxi-
mately 50 per cent of the seniors
have purchased Owls. If the Owl
does not get more support in future
years it will be necessary for it to
be cut in size and quality. One way
to alleviate this situation would be
to assess each senior the price of
the Owl in his graduation fee.

The question for this week's
Pitt P011 is, "What do you think
of having each senior pay a com-
pulsory fee for the Owl?”

Elmer Guckert, Col. ’52: “If
seniors want a yearbook as good
as the Owl has been in the past
they’ll have to pay for it. This is
one way to see that the Owl is
supported.”

Fay Schilit, Col. ’54: "I. think
it’s ,a good idea because it’s the
seniors that get the most benefit
from the Owl.” ~

Earl Jacob, Bus.- Ed. '51:
"Every senior should obtain an
Owl. One way to continue the Owl
is to have each senior pay a com-
pulsory fee.”

Lessa Caplan, Col. '52: .“I’m
definitely in favor of it. Something
as important as the Owl shouldn't
have to suffer because of negligent
students.”

Jim Hoobler, Col. '51: “It’s a
good idea. It would assure Pitt
students of a complete record of
their college career.”

Gloria Woffad, Col. ’54: “It’s a
good idea, because eventually

every senior will want a record of,

his college years.”

Jay Caldwell, Bus. Ed. '53! "1
don’t believe in anything compul-
sory, but it’s all right if students
don’t object too strongly.”

Howard Greenberger, Col. ’51:
“In order to have the ‘Owl continue
at its high quality, it is necessary
for it to be fully supported. Inas-
much as a yearbook becomes even
more treasured as the years go by
it would be well for the University
to consider including the yearbook
fee in an activities fee. No doubt
the price could be reduced if there
were more purchasers."

Suzanne Gould, Col. ’54: “It’s a
good idea and should be carried
out.”

John DeFiugl, Graduate School:
"Since it has been shown in the
past that the seniors do want an
Owl, a few dollars more in the gra-
duation fee is worthwhile.”

Romeo DiGioia, Grad. School:
"Since the majority want an Owl
the few who don’t want it should
go along with the majority.”

Elaine Grossman, Col. ’54: “I
think the seniors should have

enough interest to want to do that.”

Above Parity

But you have to admire those boys.

They have jacked their prices above
Pafity _in an extremely unobtrusive
manner. They have not jolted us
with outright increases on the menus,
nor have they increased ‘the size of
their take at the cash register. Theirs
is a more subtle, more painless ap-
proach to the whole thing.

And our patriotic restaurateurs
have been able to combine the pre-
servation of our natural resources
with their deft bit of gouging. With a
wee nip here, a cut there and a little
reducing elsewhere th eyhave managed
to keep the across-the-board tariff
for a meal at last year's levels.

By cutting the number of oysters in
oyster stew to the point where it is
nothing more than warm milk, they

— . . 1
Still keep oyster stew on the menu

and it still costs only (ah) '75 cents.
By knocking coffee and soup from the 
price of a steak dinner, you still get ,
a steak dinner for a buck and a quer-
ter.

Same Cost, Smaller Size

In some places down on Forbes
they’ve knocked the vegetable from
the a la carte servings. In one place 
they even reduced the number of
French fries in a serving. At another
you get four shrimp instead of five j
with a meal. At one time they used 
to give six. Ah, for the good old days. 1

But probably the most nefarious
price gouging is done by the tavern
proprietors. Some of these enterpris-
ing chaps have carried out the philo-
sophy of upward progress by putting
larger false bottoms in their beer
mugs. A dastardly practice.

If this continues the tavern owners
will accomplish what the WCTU has
been striving to do for years, and the
restaurant owners will achieve what
diet experts have gotten rich doing
for years. Our drinking and eating
will go down as the prices soar ever
upward.

OVERSET

Draft and Hadacol

BOB THOMAS

Dr. McElroy couldn’t see why

College personnel, be they administrators or students, aren't
the only ones worried about the draft and its impact upon Ameri-
can life. I was talking recently with Dr. Howard C. McElroy,
principal of McKeesport High School, and he, too, was looking
at the muddled-up manpower situation with great interest.

top Washington officials and legis-
lators were hemming and hawing
about passing a UMT bill. Also,
he thought out loud that high
school students should be drafted
some time after graduation, but be-
fore they put their roots down into
some other permanent field of work
or study. T

It seems to me that this whole
question of draft versus the 18
year-old has been blown up into a
huge nightmare until it has become
a mental stumbling block in the
path of clear thinking by the red-
tape experts on Capitol Hill.

The fact that no mother or fa-
ther wants her son to go off to
war is, it seems to me, apparent.
But that a parent would, for ins-
tance, refuse to vote for the in-
cumbent administration because
it willed that her 18 year-old son
should join her 19 year-old in the
draft is just not tenable.

531 Fear l8

Just what mystic symbolism
have the nation's 531 lawmakers in
Washington applied to the figure
’18’? Can you figure it out?

Idle thought: Do the waitresses
in the Blue Tuck Shop hate to make
hot fudge sundaes as much as the
looks on their faces indicate when
you ask for one? It’s gotten so that
I feel I’m imposing on them.

We on the Pitt News have finally
had a chance to taste that ambrosia
of the patent medicines, Hadacol.
Most of us, I suppose, had been

could buy an experimental bottle of
the stuff; and last week that
chance came.

If you remember we ran a feature
story on geography prof DeNux
LeBlanc and his Hadacol-baron
cousin,. Dudley in the last issue-
For the picture with the story we
needed a prop so photographer
Jack Warren was dispatched to buy
us some Hadacol on expense
account of course.

‘Hadacol Wins

The picture went off all right.
Then Warren, not knowing what
else to do with it, brought the
bottle back to the News office.
Well, they have been saying since
the days of the papyrus" scroll
that ‘curiosity killed the cat.’ And
of course we're human. _

Warren himself took the first
nip; others followed. The looks on
the faces of the drinkers said that
they had swallowed some sort of
hideous-tasting poison. Comments
ranged all up and down the scale
fromi“awful” to “horrible” to “un-
printable.” It really tasted bad "
to everyone except Warren. He likes
the stuff, in fact he swears it
tastes like_ good zinfandel wine.

By the way, there.is only 12 per
cent alcohol in Hadacol. We've
heard wild estimates ranging from
1 per cent to a highly-potent 60. So,
since Hadacol costs six times as
much as a bottle of beer, you might
as well forget abopt your plans for
a prolonged Hadacol' jag.

an insight on Russia and .world

ROCHESTER ,N.Y. -- (I.P.) -- a comprehensive interdepart-
mental program to give University of Rochester undergraduates

Communism has been introduced

in the College of Arts and Science this year.

Two new courses have been com-
bined with one on Russian history
given for many years here. Stu-
dents now have an opportunity to
obtain an understanding of the So-
viet Union, its historical founda-
tions, present organization, me-
thods and aim.

Economic Background
The first of the new courses,

"Russian Economic and Social
Institutions and Policies,” is
given by Assistant Professor

Otakar Kutvirt of the Department
of Economics, a former officialof
the Czech government who escaped
from the country when the Com-
munists seized power, and who

was a leader of the underground

movement against the Nazis in

World "War II.

The second course will present
specialists in many fields who will
discuss world effects of Commu-
nism on science, art, music, lite-
rature and international political
and economic relations.

To improve Understanding

Students majoring in several de-
partments elect one or more of
these courses as related subjects
in their fields of concentration.
Dr. J. Edward lloffmeister, dean of
the College, said that the admini-
stration regards it as essential
“to insure that no student shall
graduate into a world in crisis
without having had an opportunity
to obtain the intellectual tools.
necessary to sound political judg-

ment and wise citizenship.”

Pit-h Battle Here Tonight

LOOK OUT. HEAVIES -- Here’s the Panthers’ new heavyweight sen-
sation, Sophomore Gail Ellis, who '11 be in action when Pitt wrestles

West Virginia at the Stadium Saturday.

44*

Soph Heavyweight

Is Peery’s Prize Package

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Prize packages will be accepted anytime, thank you.

Wre stling

Coach Rex Peery wasted no time to enroll Heavyweight Gail Ellis at
Pitt when the sport was revived here last year.

And Ellis is well on his way to
proving his worth as a matman this
season.

Until Gail entered the wrestling
picture in February after becoming
eligible at mid-term, the Panthers
hadn’t won in the heavyweight divi-
sion. Since then, the big sophomore
has registered four wins while
losing only once.

Oklahoma Imports

His latest victory came against
Franklin and Marshall at Lancaster
last Saturday, but the Panthers
dropped their sixth match of the
season, 14-12. Their record now is
6-6.

The 220-pound transfer student
from Northeastern Oklahoma State
College, along with Hugh Peery,
frosh wrestling standout, are the
sole “imports” on the wrestling
squad.

Gail and Hugh were teammates at
Tulsa Central in Oklahoma where
they were outstanding in tournament
matches.

Defeated Giant

One of Ellis’ best performances
came against a hulking 275-pound
giant from Northwestern, Ralph
Jecha who doubles as a football
guard. Gail’s superior speed en-

Cail Ellis

abled him to beat Jecha, 7-4.

Football has also figured in
Ellis’ athletic career. Gail played
first-string defensive lineman on
the freshman team and will be a
candidate for the varsity come
spring drills.

Panthers Out to Prove
Early Loss a Fluke

B)’ WILL DOERGE
Sports Editor

Doc Carlson’s Panthers are out to prove tonight that their
loss to Carnegie Tech earlier in the season was a gross miscar-

riage of justice.

The Tartans and Panthers clash at the Stadium at 8:15 follow-

ing a game between the freshman
teams of both schools.

By all reasoning, Carnegie Tech
doesn’t belong on the same floor as
Pitt, but yet the pushover Tartans—
to otherteams -—manage to show their
best against their Oakland rivals.

Pitt Superior--But

Pitt was a 65-50victorover Gettys-
burg while Tech was swamped by
Gettysburg, 79-55. In fact any other
comparison made between Pitt and
Tech shows the Panthers far superior
to the Plaid.

With one embarrassing exception,
however. Tech drubbed Pitt at Skibo
gym, 66-42, when the Panthers bore
little resemblance to a basketball
team. The Tartans were high for
that game while the Panthers looked
like five guys who were playing to-
gether for the first time.

A decisive victory over the Tar-
tans tonight would reduce the stigma
of that unfortunate game, as the Pan-
thers well realize.

‘Hg Game Monday

Tonight’s game is only a warmup,
however, to the big game of the sea-
son on Monday when West Virginia
comes here to close down the short
home season.

Every Pitt- West Virginia game at
the Stadium usually brings down the
house. The thrilling game at Morgan-
town last Saturday which the Moun-
taineers won, 56-52, was only a pre-
liminary to the big show next Monday.

Let’s hope by that time Carlson
will have figured some way to stop
the 6-9 Mark Workman, whose one-
man gang performance of 31 points
defeated the Panthers.

An added attraction to the remain-
ing Pitt games is the race of Mike
Belich to break Sammy David’s scor-
ing record of 390 points. Belich now
has 339 points with four games left
to play.

Fins Win 4th;
Temple Next

Two years ago the Penn State
swimming team handed Ben Grady’s
tankers a costly defeat. Since then
the Panthers have made it a point
to be up for the Nittany Lions.

Last Saturday's convincing 52-
23 victory coupled with last year’s
S6-19 conquest’ has helped Pitt for-
get that lone season defeat two
years ago.

Jim Zentgraf, Bill Corr, Al
Ciocca, and Bob Gover, turned in
winning performances for the Pan-
ther natators. Zentgraf set a new
pool record in the 200-yard free
style race with a time of 2:l7.8.

On Saturday the Panthers will
try for their third straight victory
in an away meet with Temple at
Philadelphia.

The Pitt tankers have now won
four while losing only to Navy and
Ohio State.

GRIDDERS MEETING
There will be a meeting on
Friday of varsity football players
in 132 C1. at 3:45.

OIM Playoffs
Under Way

The intermural basketball play-
offs got under way Monday night at
Trees gym with the top-seeded Little
Jawns eliminating the.Pitt Yanks,
33-19, and the East End Raiders de-
feating the Munhall Indians, 29-18.

This evening the first round ac-
tion continues with the Pharmacy
Frosh playing the winner of last
night's Whips-Dukes game, Onyx
meeting the Polecats, and the Die-
hards playing the Med Freshmen.

Competing in the fraternity play-
offs this week willbe the Phi Delts,
Phi Gams, Sigma Chi, and last year’s
champion, the Phi Eps, who are
seeking their fourth consecutive
fraternity title.

IM Director Leo Bemis has chosen
the first two teams from nine of ten
leagues to compete in the playoffs
for the All-Campus championship.
Only the Fraternity "B” League is
not represented.

In order to assure a fair tourna-
ment with the best two teams meet-
ing for the championship, Bemis has
topiseeded the Little Jawns and the
Pharmacy Mixers and second seeded

RECORIPBREAKERS - These three frosh swimmers have amassed a
long string of records prior to entering Pitt. They are, left to right —
Fred O’Nions of Oliver, Ron Gainsford of Schenley, and Harry Piwo-

warski, also of Schenley.

By DON MURDOCK

Records were made to be broken

Dick Petro’s freshmen swimmers
while they were in high school.

The three, undefeated in three
frosh meets this year, are Fred 0’-
Nions of Oliver and Ronnie Gains-
ford and Harry Piwowarski of Schen-
ley.

All three have made a habit of
winning championships and setting
records since their sophomore years

in high school. Varsity swimming
coachBen Grady hopes thatthe habit

will continue and perhaps become
contagious to other Panther tankers.

B)’ WILL DOERGE
Sports Editor
'It’s a sad fact to state but Carnegie Tech rooters will probably
outnumber the Pitt rooters at tonight’s game. Student support of
the Panthers has been slightly less than enthusiastic.

At no home game this season has
the student attendance been over
500. The high was 469 at the West-
minster game. The low— 150 at the
Bucknell game.

The reason for this lack of stu-
dent interest in Pitt basketball is
not hard to figure out.

Pitt Team Lousy?

It was the panthers’ misfortune
to play their first ten games on the
road. They lost nine of those ten
games.

So everybody figures they have a
lousy team. When they réturn home
with the season half gone, as far as
the fans are concerned, it's over.
After all, what can Pitt hope to sal-
vage out of the season?

But the truth of the matter is that
Pitt doesn’t have a bad team at all.
Playing away from home can break
the best of teams.

Panthers Underrated

At home Pitt has played some ex-
cellent basketball in winning four of
five games, pulling stellar victories
over Westminster and Penn State.

State coach Elmer Gross said
after last week's game -- “They
outshot us, outrebounded us --
they outplayed us. Pitt is an un-
derrated team."

From this comer, they are bet-
ter than many of the teams that
are rated above them in the dis--
trict. Pill; just doesn't fatten up
at home on the weak teams like
some others do.

It all boils down to the fact
that Pitt can't begin the season

'n the Army at which time he was
selected on the ALI-American Army
swimming squad. He was an All-
American high school selection in


O’Nions was placed on the All-

Trio of Record-Breakers
Brighten Pitt Tank Future

American high school swimming team

in 1949 and 1950. He holds the AMA-

AAU 100- and 200-yard breaststroke
record and also the City High School
breaststroke record.

A freestyle specialist, Piwowarski
copped the City 30- and 100-yard
freestyle championship during his
last three high school years. He also

holds the 60-yard freestyle AMA-AA
record. The 18-year-old flash ha
won the 100-yard freestyle race it
each of the Panther yearling meets.

Gainsford Confident

Piwowarski teams up with Gains
ford and O’Nions in the 180-yarc
medley relay in which Pitt has breezec
to victory in all of its encounters.

“There’s nothing to Worry about
we’ll stay undefeated,” is the con
fident attitude expressed by Gains
ford. Perhaps it is a bit optimistic
but considering all the records they
have set, nothing is impossible.

1. I’m a June senior. If I leave
for any of the services now, dol
get my diploma?

Yes. You get credits for a full
semester and a diploma.

2. I’m a sophomore. What credits
can I salvage ifl leave for military
service in_ the middle of the se-
mester?

You can get credits for the per-
centage of time you have spent
in the course, providing your
work is satisfactory. For ins-
tance, if you attend for one third
of a semester, you will get one
credit for each three creditt
course. Tuition will be charged
according to the number of ore-
gtdits you receive.

3. Does this apply if I enlist as
well as ifl am drafted?

Yes.

4. If they start deferring on a
basis of good grades, how high
must my grade average be to per-
mit me a deferment?

No specific answer yet. As Gene-
ral Hershey says, it certainly
won't hurt to have good grades.

5. What chance have I for OCS if
I am drafted or enlist?

About 5,000 Army OCS commis-
sions will go to men from the
ranks in the next 12 months.
There are 900,000 enlisted men
to draw from. ROTC, either
Army or Air Force, is deﬁnitely
your best bet for a commission.

'7. When I graduate in June, is
there a chance for me to get into
essential industry?

Yes. You will not be inducted
for 30 days after graduation. If
you can get into a deferment-
cartying job, your local board

8- When I get my induction no-

tice, does that mean I can no 10mg-
er enlist in the Navy, Air Force,
Marines, or Coast Guard?
No. You will have a chance in
the month or two before the end
of the semester to enlist in one
of these services and be called
to active duty at the end of the
semester. There is no promise
that any one of these services
will be .taking enlistments at
that time, however. Enlistment
is open or closed from time to
time as training facilities are
available.

9. What are my chances of being
deferred until I finish college?

If you are in ROTC, and keep up
to snuff, you stay. If you are in a

technical field, chances are
good. If you are a liberal arts
student, chances are less good,
but many manpower experts and
educators are pushing for defer-
ment of all college students who
are doing good work on the basis
that we need teachers, ministers,
doctors, and lawyers, as well as
technicians, particularly if this
is to be a long-tenn emergency.
