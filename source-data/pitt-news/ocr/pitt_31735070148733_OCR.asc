But on the other side.« of the
world, everything was silent.

As more than a million people
in North Korea starved to death

V under the leadership of Kim_]ong—

oblivious.

' Pitt’s chapter of Liberties in
North Korea is a nonproﬁt student
organization designed to break
down those walls of silence.

“We raise awareness about not

i only the human—rights atrocities

going on in North Korea, but also
the refugee situation in China,”
T.J. Collanto, president of Pitt’s
Liberty in North Korea" chapter,
said.

"Last year, former Pitt seniors
Laura Lee and Jimmy Eppley
launched the organization on
campus. They devised a way to in-

“We felt a need to address the
issue and felt that people in the

as aware of the issues as we felt
that they needed to be,” Collanto
said.

In memoriam: Suhas Krishnamurthy

Danny Zaidi
Staff Writer

Friends of the late Suhas Krish-
namurthy describe him as a pas-
sionate writer, a caring friend
and a successful Ph.D. student.

Krishnamurthy died on Oct. 7'
in Pitt’s College Gardens apart-"

ments..Information on the cause
of his death is pending results
from an autopsy. S
 7 The former Pitt graduate stu-
dent’s family ﬂew his body to In-
dia, where he wascremated in
line with Hindu tradition.
A native of Bangalore, India,
Krishnamurthy lived in Pitts-
burgh for the past four years.

Hisparents and older brother
currently reside in India.
Graduate students Madhav
Sankunny and Sandeep Prakasam
both knew Krishnamurthy for the
four years that he spentworking
on his doctorate in the Graduate
Schoolof Public Health’s Depart-
ment of Human Genetics. '
Theydescribed Krishnamur-

thy as a very sociable person who g

loved to converse with people.
“He was very outgoing and
friendly, and more of a‘ people-
person who likes to chat with
people, especially old friends,”
Prakasam said. .

Union on Oct. 9.
Krishnamurthy was involved
in organizations through the Sri
Venkateswara Temple in Mon-
roeville.
“His parents and his family
are religious. He still dida lot

of activities in relation to the

temple,” Sankunny said.’ “He

was involved with the different

organizations that were associ-
atedwith the temple.”

One was the Karnataka group,
which organized plays and drama
in Kannada, a language spoken
in India. _

Krishnamurthy was a suc-
cessful student who was close to
achieving his Ph.D. His adviser,
Candace Kammerer, said that

Krishnamurthy devoted himself
to his schoolwork. He was pre-
paring to do his comprehensive
exam, in which he would write his
Ph.D. research proposal.

“Suhas was very friendly,”
Kammerer said. “I wouldn’t call
him ‘quiet—quiet.’ I mean, he
would speak, but he wasn’t an
extroverted, boisterous person.
But still he would talk. He had
some nice insights in how genet-
ics could be applied.”

Friends said that Krishna-
murthy wasan avid writer, and
he loved to blog and be a part of
social networking.

Students prepare brains for battle

Students go to Youngstown, Pa., for computer— programming competition

Mahita Gajanan
For The Pitt News

When in doubt, start with the
easiest problem.

That’s the method senior El- '

len Gawryla plans to use Satur-
day at the Association for Com-
puting Machinery International
Collegiate Programming Contest
in Youngstown, Pa.

“Some of the challenge is
in determining which ones are
easy and working on those prob-
lems first to save time,” Gawryla
said. “It is so frustrating when
you come out of the competi-
tion without solving any of the
problems.”

Six Pitt undergrads with a
passion for computer program-
ming will compete against about
300 other students in the ACM-
ICPC regional competition this
weekend. The champions will
advance to the contest’s World
Finals in Warsaw, Poland, which
are set for May 2012. The ﬁnal
international winner receives
various awards and prizes, in—
cluding the “World’s Smartest
Trophy.”

At the competitions, about
100 teams work for five hours
on eight ornine problems that
include graphs, optimization
problems and real—world chal-

lenges that the team members"

must translate into computer
programs. The students will
design framework for software
programs using programming
languages such as C, C++ andjava
to solve problems like how to
optimize air-trafﬁc patterns.

The teammates work together
to come up with an algorithm, or
a step-by-step process, to solve
the problems and then ﬁgure out
a way to code the algorithm so
the computer can provide out-
put.

John Ramirez, a Pitt computer
science professor and the team’s
coach, said that the six Pitt stu-

dents are split into two teams,
the Pitt blue team and the Pitt
gold team.-Ramirez sent out an
email to computer science stu-
dents to ﬁnd participants.‘ He
said the University can send as
many teams to the regional com-
petition as it wants.

Gawryla, a computer science
major and Pitt blue team mem-
ber, said this is the third time she
will participate in the contest.

“I got started in my sopho-
more year when my friends and I
would start random coding proj-
ects for fun, but we never ﬁn-

66

mensional problems tend to be
more complicated in general due
to the additional interactions to
keep track of.”

Gawryla said that the prob-
lems vary in their level of dif-
ficulty. .

Mary Letera, a junior major-
ing in computer science, said
that for most participants, pro-
gramming is their passion.

“If you’re asking what one

needs to enjoy the competition, ‘

that could be anything from a
strong sense of competitive-
ness to just a great sense of

ished them,” she said. “We got
excited when we found out about
local programming competitions
because we could actually ﬁnish
something.” .

Ramirez said that the teams
prepare for the contest by work-
ing on problems from previous
competitions. He noted that
each problem requires a differ-
ent strategy.

“Sometimes the three compet-
itors will work on one problem
together, or each will work on a
separate problem,” he said.

Pitt blue team member Al-
tay Hunter, a senior majoring
in computer engineering, said
that the problems are generally

mathematical.

“One-of the more challenging
problems involved is ﬁnding the
solution to a three-dimensional
puzzle,” Altay said. “Three-di-

humor,” said Letera, a member
of the Pitt gold team. “I think
it’s a given that anyone who is
participating is going to really
like programming.”

Kyra Lee, a junior computer
engineering major and another
member of the Pitt gold team,
said that competitors must be
logical.

-“You have to be able to break a
problem down into not only what
needs to happen, but how it can
happen efﬁciently,” Lee said.

This will be Hunter, Letera
and Lee’s ﬁrst experience with
the competition. They all found
out about the competition
through Ramirez’s email. ,

“I’m curious to see what it’s
like,” Lee said. “We’ve done prac-
ticing, but since this is a timed
event, it’s a whole different kind
of animal.” I

~ According to LiNK’s national website,
humanerights abuses are frequent. Reports
show that 10 out of the 11 crimes against .

-humanity outlined by the International
A Crime Court have been committed within

the nation. The committed. crimes include
rape, torture, enslavement and forced dis- -
appearances. .

“Entire families are imprisoned, includ-
ing children —— up to three generations —
because a relative had committed a crime
such as expressing disloyalty to the govern-
ment. Conditions in the camps are alleged’
to be extremely harsh and systematic and 
widespread human rights abuses occur. A
Most prisoners are not expected to sur-
vive due to such extreme conditions. So-me
reports have estimated that more than
400,000 prisoners may have already died
in this system,” a LiNK synopsis said.

Every two weeks, Pitt LiNK, which is
compose.d of about 15 regular members,
meets to talk about the issues North Kore—
ans face. Documentaries and guests are a
regular addition to meetings. Last month,
the group hosted representatives from the
national LiNK organization and screened
the documentary “Hiding,” which LiNK
produced.

The group also focuses on fundraising
for the refugees. Every Friday, theorganiza-‘
tion holds its Pizza Friday event, offering ‘
$1‘pizza slices on thesecond ﬂoor of Posvar
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Proceeds go to North

Korean refugees.

ya But LiNK member Nick Velonis said that,
with all the troubles facing North Korea,
more could be done to help.

“I would like to see our group evolve
and develop more of an impact on campus
raising awareness,” Velonis said. He also
serves as the public relations representa-

_tive for Pitt LiNK.

The group’s ﬁrst beneﬁt concert is one
attempt to boost awareness of the injustices
in North Korea.

The group hopes to try and host a beneﬁt

“All the money we raise goes toward
helping refugees in China, and that comes
in the form of transportation and liter-
ally ﬁnding these people and providing
them with a way out of the nation, wheth-
er that’s through Southeast Asia and into
South Korea or into the United States,”
Collanto said.

LiNK also helps provide shelter, food

circumstances.

Amnesty International, Pittsburgh Hu-

Involvement with LiNK offers Pitt stu-

ing impact on the lives of others.

“We explain it as, ‘$2,500 saves one refu-

in fundraising, that $2,500 will be put into

A Sizeable Advantage v

Wesley WarrenJr., a 47-year-

namely, a 100-pound scrotum.
His condition, known as scrotal
elephantiasis, prevents Warren
from maintaining romantic re-

ing to the Las Vegas Review-Jour-

A Iargeage difference often

Leah Trimble
Columnist

The tabloids went crazy these
past couple weeks over yet an-
other alleged celebrity affair.
Star Magazine, along with the
New York Daily News and several
other tabloid magazines, report-
ed in late September that Ashton
Kutcher supposedly cheated on
his wife Demi Moore. The worst
part? The unfaithfulness alleg-
edly took place thelnight of their
six-year wedding anniversary.

Prior to this, Kutcher and
Moore were renowned for main-
taining a healthy relationship
in spite of their 15-year age dif-
ference (Moore is now just two
years from turning 50, whereas
Kutcher is only 33). Sounds like
it was the ideal situation for both
of them: He dates the hot older
woman, and she gets a fresh,
hot, younger. catch. Maybe it
helped that they were both so
damn attractive.

But until recently, were they
living one of those —'— for lack

of a better phrase — “modern-
day fairytales”? Tobe honest,
I don’t know. My friends know
that I’ve thought about under-
taking a less-severe breach of
age etiquette: dating a freshman,

teaching him the relationship.

ropes. I think I actually deﬁned
it as making him “my slave.”
Shameful, I know. But some
women want a younger man to
worship her and put her on a
pedestal. Realistically, however,
this adds up to an unsustain-
able Hollywood -fantasy. While
there arealways those few rare
couples that defy the expected
dating disasters, age ‘differences
are invariably difficult to over-
come, regardless of which part-
ner is older.

Still, “cougar” relationships
are a very real phenomenon. A
2003 AARP study revealed that
34 percent of all surveyed wom-
en over 40 were dating younger
men, and 35 percent preferred
it to dating older men. Contrib-
uting to this, I’d guess, is the
media’s infatuation with such
couples, women’s increasing

independence and power and a
growing disregard for age (Don’t
even get me started on cougar
dating sites). New marriage and
partnership rules are natural by-
products of these trends.

But tellingly, many non-Hol-
lywood “cougar” relationships
don’t wind up at the altar, just
as partnerships between older
men and significantly younger
women don’t usually succeed (I

i only know of two real-life cou-

ples that have sustained long-
term cougar dating; only one
has made it to marriage). The
same trend applies in same-sex
relationships, which experience
the same issues. There’s noth-
ing wrong with attempting this

-lifestyle, but that doesn’t mean

people with a 20-year age dif-
ference can easily overcome
the accompanying problems.
I will never believe that most
men in their college years can
truly understand or appreciate
a woman’s life after kids, for
example.

Part of the reason an age dif-

Hollywood perpetuates unrealistic expectations

Trimble < 4

ference sometimes works in Hollywood
and not the real world is that the former
operates by its own standards. Celeb-
rity 15—year—olds routinely go to rehab
and buy mansions. How many regular
young teens do you know that do this?
Actors and actresses mature differently
(depending on their careers), have outra-
geous incomes and often are exception-
ally good looking. They don’t need each
other for money or for their careers. In
fact, in an interview with Details maga-
zine, Kutcher once spoke of his attraction

to Moore in the following terms: “She

straight up didn’t need me  She wanted
me, but she didn’t need me, so she could
put it on the line.” For better or for worse,
the average relationship might not afford
the same luxuries.

Of course, I should acknowledge that
several studies suggest that cougar com-
panionships can work. Yet none take into
account how attractive the women are.
My guess is, if’ she’s smokin" hot, her
chances of success are probably a bit

biggest reason men play into the “cougar
sex fantasy”: the word “cougar” is associ-
ated with beauty and sexiness — qualities
that aren’t necessarily universal.

For a friend of mine, age difference
and unrealistic fantasy were precisely
the reasons a ﬂing of his ended. ‘‘[She] ’
treated me like a pet,” he said of an older
woman. “She’d decide what was done in
the bedroom  I felt like I had to alwéiys .
be on my A-game or else I wasn’t good
enough. It was an uphill climb just based
off of me being younger. The aura was

exciting, but I think she felt like a babysit-
ter, and when it was playtime she would
call on me.”

All this isn’t to say that both men_ and -

women don’t ‘deserve to date for have
sexual relations with whomever they
please, no matter what the reasoning is.
Women deserve to be looked at as sexy
and mature, not one or. the other. It’s all

WOMEN'S SOCCER

 

Seniors prepare for last match as Panthers

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ Writer

Pitt women’s soccer players Ka-
tie Ruhe and Kristina Rioux
have roomed together since ar-
riving on campus. As freshmen,
they had nine other teammates
in their class. Now — four years
later — they are the only two that
remain. .

“We came in with nine [play-
ers] ,and then‘ we added two trans-
fers,” Rioux said. “Then everybody
either quit or transferred, and now
ifs just me and Katie  It’s weird to
think that we’re the only two who
stuck it out and didn’t quit.”

On Friday, the two roommates
will take the ﬁeld as teammates

one ﬁnal time. Ruhe will graduate A S

and move on from Pitt, whereas
Rioux will play one more season.

She has one year of eligibility re-

maining because she sat out all of
last season with an injury. ,
Pitt (2-12-4,‘ 1-7-2) plays nation-
ally ranked West Virginia (13-4, 9-1)
at 7 p.m. Friday, and the match will
be the Panthers’ last game of the

season. The seniors —— including -

ﬁfth-year player Katheryn Kunugi
— will be honored beforehand on
Ambrose Urbanic‘Field.

Ruhe graduates in the spring
and said she plans to attend gradu-
ate school somewhere in the South,
but she hasn’t jdecided where.
For her, Friday’s senior night is a
chance to reﬂect on a career during

which she became the program’s ’
~ all-time assists leader and played

a leading role in the school’s ﬁrst—

ever winning season in 2009.

Ruhe said that a victory over
West Virginia on Friday would
“make [her] career.”

V “This season’s’ been so awful
that if we beat West Virginia on
senior night — my last game ——
that’s what I would look back on
and think about,” she said.

Rioux will return in goal for the T 5 

Panthers next season. Neverthe-

iess, she said that she is focused on‘ ‘

beating West Virginia, adding that

awin against Pitt’s biggest rival on’
Friday night would be the sendioffv A L E

that her fellow seniors deserve.

“It’s a difficult season when you l

only get two wins,” Rioux said.

.,,_..—....,.-............. -..-—-nae. .-.v..‘AH,_ ,_ _ __,._ ,.._‘.,_ .._,__ _,\ __-__

“But beating West Virginia on Fri-
day would really kind of turn this

seniors off on a positive note.”

credited the two on their leader-

ship and motivational skills.
“They were able to bring the

team together on numerous oc-

' casions,” Rioux said. “Whether

it’s practice or games, they were
always able to pick everyo ne’s
spirits up and bring the intensity
up. That’s deﬁnitely something I’m
going to miss. They made me play
better because of their leadership
and intensity that they brought to

.= I everything that they did.”

Despite the team’s woes,’head

, coach Sue-Moy Chin said that the
_ senior class showed character by

never throwing in the towel — re-
gardless _of how many losses they

V suffered. L

“They’ve shown the younger
players, especially the juniors, how
to be strong leaders in the face of
adversity,” Chin said. “They never
gave up; they continued to push
and fight, just trying to show the
younger players what it takes to
compete at this level.”

Pitt will take on the role of po-
tential spoiler Friday night, as they
face a West Virginia team that is

battling Marquette for the No. 1
» seed in the Big East tournament.

The Panthers are also hoping
to avenge last season’s loss to the
Mountaineers. The two teams were
locked in a scoreless tie until, with
43 minutes remaining, the game
was postponed due to lightning.

When the action resumed 11
days later, Pittwas without Liz Car-
roll —— its starting midﬁelder —
who suifered a concussion prior to
the match. The Mountaineers shut
out the Panthers 3-0 and managed
double the amount of shots.

Ruhe said that she is approach-
ing Friday’s game —— the last that
she will ever play as aPanther —

I differently from last year. —

“I want to gointo it and just

have fun,” she said. “I don't ever

want to not be smiling and laugh-
ing; I just want everything to be

The Pitt women’s swimming

and diving team is essentially‘,

starting from scratch this sea-
son as 15 freshmen prepare for
their collegiate debuts.

Head coach Chuck Knoles
said that this means a lot of
the coaches’ attention has
been focused on preparing
the young athletes for com-
petition.

“All of our practices so far
have focused on: what are the
basics of swimming, how do

you start well, how do you turnﬁ
well, how do you finish well, i

and I guess the proof will be
in the pudding with them,”
Knoles said.

» The swimming and diving
team will hit the pool for the
first time against an opponent
this season when it faces Buf-
falo at home on Friday at 5 p.m.
and St. Bonaventure in Olean,
N.Y., on Saturday at 11 a.m.

Expectations are high for

'~'-VOLLEYBALL ~

Panthers look to recover from two straight defeats?

. ,3, ' Torie Wytiaz

Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt volleyball team struggled in its
last two matches, ultimately losing both,
but the Panthers have used those games to

’ ’ pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses

as they head into matchups with two of the
Big East’s best teams. For senior middle
hitter Lauren Hartman, the team’s biggest
necessity is a reduction in errors on the
Panthers’ own side of the court.

“We need to focus on our own game and
work to minimize our mistakes, whether
serving or kill errors,” Hartman said. “We
have been beating ourselves at times, and
we cannot do that against the best teams
in the Big East.”

After falling 3-0 to Robert Morris and

‘*3-2 to West Virginia, the Panthers (13—9,

3-4 Big East) will travel to play Cincinnati
(13-8, 5-2) and Louisville (15—4, 7-0), who
are currently third and ﬁrst in the confer-
ence, respectively.

“Cincinnati and Louisville are both solid
teams that are playing great volleyball right
now,” Pitt head coach Toby Rens said. “We
will have to be at the top of our game to get
these two wins.”

committed 28 kill errors and ended the
match with a hitting clip of just .044. That
ﬁgure improved to .128 against West Vir-

ginia, but the Panthers totaled 12 service

errors in the match compared to the Moun-
taineers’ seven.

“A big aspect of eliminating those mis-
takes will be starting strong in our matches,
working to win the ﬁrst few points and
building our conﬁdence,” Hartman said.

Rens said he believes the Panthers have
been inconsistent, something that he at-
tributes in part to a lack of experience.

“At times against West Virginia, we were
playing high—level volleyball, and at other
times we were committing mental errors,”
Rens said. “We have a young team that is
still looking to ﬁnd consistency, and that
will be our focus for the remainder of the
season.”

The Panther roster includes just two
seniors, allowing extensive court time for
many freshmen and sophomores, including

starters sophomore Monica Wignot and _

freshman Lindsey Zitzke. » -

With ﬁve double—double performanc-
es, outside hitter Wignot has been an all-
around contributor for the Panthers. Most
recently, she recorded 16 kills and 20 digs
against West Virginia.

1

As the starting setter, Zitzke has the ‘

task of running the Panther offense. She’s
been named the Big East Freshman of the
Week twice this season.

Despite being placed in a high-pressure
position as a freshman, Zitzke feels com-
fortable in her_ role on the court.

“Being the‘ setter, I know I have to be
consistent and work to make our olfense

run eﬂiciently,” Zitzke said of her respon-
sibilities on the team. “Keeping up com-
munication on the court can help, and it

 

gets everyone involved.”

Rens agreed and noted thatythese two
young players are bright spots in Pitt’s

future.

“Monica and Lindsey are really stepping I

up for us this year,” Rens said. “Hopefully
they will only continue to improve through-
out the season and in coming seasons.” 1
The Panthers will need to minimize er-
rors andattain consistency this weekend
when they take on some ofthe bestplayers
in the conference. A ,
Louisville’s junior outside hitter L01
Arslanbekova was recently honored as the

Big East Player of -the Week for the thirifl

consecutive week thanks to her role in lead-
ing the Cardinals to two wins. I
Arslanbekova averaged 20 kills in those

two matches, and she currently leads thie

league with 326 total kills. __
Cincinnati looks to junior middle
blocker Jordanne Scott for its _offensiv’e
production while sophomore Emily Ma-
cintyre paces the defense from the libero
position. 1
For Rens, both teams will present unique
challenges for the Panthers. '

“Cincinnati and Louisville are both

physical teams, but Cincinnati tends to
alternate their attack while Louisville runs
a quicker style of offense,” Rens said. “From
our side, though, preparation will be simi-
lar this week as we focus on our gameratheir
than their game.” i

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

West Virginia continues
to lead Big East

R] Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

ganotlier week of Big East football proved that :

fwest Virginia is deﬁnitely the best team in the
iionference —— and the Mountaineers didn’t
"even play. i -
Rutgers followed up its impressive victory
over Pitt by barely managing to hold off a sub-

-  ar Navy team, Cincinnati struggled against

one of the conference’s worst teams in Louis-
aville, and Pitt’s offense continued to be far too
_' anemic to suggest that the Panthers could be
3’: contender. ,

This week marks the first in which three Big
_East matches be played. Here are my current

rankings of the conference’s eight teams:

1. WestVirginia—By sittingback and watch- .

ing other contenders struggle, the Mountain-
‘_eers (5-1, 1-0 Big East) enjoyed a bye week that
fjconﬁrmed them as the best in the Big East. But
 wants to remain at the top, it must pass
 ﬁrst road conference test of the season this
Friday night at Syracuse before a national tele-
vision audience. The Orange have a knack for
gkeepingthings close, sothey might just give the
Mountaineers ascare. »

2. Rutgers —- Despite a lackluster perfor-
mance in their 21-20 victory over Navy, the
Scarlet Knights (5-1, 2-0 Big East) will say a win
is a win and move on. Like WVU, Rutgers hits
the road Friday night for a nationally televised
matchup at Louisville. The Scarlet Knights have
been the Cinderella story of the Big'East this
season, and another conference roadwinwould
Ese a huge step toward proving their legitimacy

J  title contenders this season.
 if 3. Cincinnati — Speaking oflackluster, that’s

§,exactlywhatthe Bearcats (5-1, 1-0 BigEast) were ‘

‘ inthe ﬁrst halfoftheir conference opener on Sat-
urday, when they hosted Louisville. But Cincin-
nati responded to the adversity by shutting out
the Cardinals in the second half, and its offense
did enough to post a 25-16 win. The Bearcats
could be a dangerous team in the Big East go-
lng forward, and they’ll be hoping to become
bowl eligible Saturday with a win at struggling
South Florida.

4. Pittsburgh - The Panthers (3-4, 1-1 Big
East) hold onto this spot based on talent and
potential alone —— their recent play deﬁnitely
merits a much lower ranking. Pitt’s offense has
put up 10 points combined in its last two out-
ings,whichis even more perplexing considering

-ghe drought comes immediately after the same

ffense put up 44 points against South Florida.

- e Panthers have the weekend off to regroup

 d prepare for a key game next Wednesday

against Connecticut. '

5. Syracuse —Just like its opponentthis Fri-
day, Syracuse (4-2, 0-1 Big East) looks a little bit
better in this conference in relation to its rivals’

  
  

, 15erformancesthisweek.TheOrangelooklikea

middle—of-the-pack kind of team inthe Big East
this season, but if they can somehow upset the
Mountaineers Friday night, everyone will take
notice of this team from upstate New York.

6. Connecticut —— The Huskies (3-4, 1-1 Big
East) picked up a key win this weekend against
South Florida in a typically ugly 16-10 Big East
game. UConn hasn’tplayedas badlythis season
as its record might suggest, and the Huskies
could really make a statement ifthey are able
to take advantage of Pitt, another struggling
team, next week. .

7. South Florida-—Aftera4-0 start, the Bulls
(4-2, 0-2) decidedto begin their typical collapse
alittle bit earlythis season by gettingbeat at Pitt

and Connecticut Ithoughtthis mightbe the year '

SouthFlorida broke through and won the confer-
ence, but instead, Skip Holtz’s teamwill have its
eyes set on picking up two more wins and going
to another mediocre bowl this season.

8. Louisville — Unfortunately for Cardinals
fans, Louisville (2-4, 0-1 Big East) has been a
staple at the bottom of these standings this sea-
son. This is a team in a rebuilding stage with
lots of young talent under second-year coach
Charlie Strong. IfSaturday’s performance against
Cincinnati is anything to go by, the Cardinals
mightmake afew BigEast games interestingfor
the remainder of the year, but I can’t see them

Offensive Player of the Week: Isaiah Pead,
Running Back, Cincinnati — The senior ball

. carrier has been huge for the Bearcats this sea-

son and is one of the main reasons they sit at a

. surprising 5-1. He showed his ability Saturday

when he rushed for 151 yards and broke a 50-

‘ yard touchdown rim inthe fourth quarter, giving

Cincinnati the lead for good.

Defensive Player of the Week: Byron Jones,
Defensive Back, Connecticut -— One play can
make a huge difference in a game, and Jones
proved that Saturday when his 10-yard fumble
recovery for a touchdown in the third quarter
gavethe Husldes a16-lowinagainstsouth Flor-
ida. On a day when the UConn offense couldn’t
ﬁndthe end zone,Jones and the defense decided
to take matters into their own hands by scoring
the game-deciding touchdown. ‘

Coach of the Week: Butchjones, Cincinnati
—CoachJones hadatough job inreplacing Brian
Kelly‘,-and he hadmany Bearcat fans worried

C alter struggling to a 4-8 record last season. But

Jones’ team has already improved on their win
total by racing outto a-5-1 start,.and Cincinnati
mightjust be an outside contender to reclaim
the Big East Championship.
Whatto watch forinweek eight: Friday night
road tests — With their crucial matchup next
weekend looming, both West Virginia and Rut-
gers can’t afford to look ahead. With trips to
Syracuse and Louisville, respectively, both teams
_mus;t‘emerge victorious from this Friday’s road
 they want to enter theirshowdown
undefeated in Big East play. I 1 .

Men’s team
searching  
for revenge

Swimming (2 7

Bobby Mizia I Staff Photographer
The men’s swimming and diving team haste .
balance of lower- and upperclassrnen.

Panthers to set pool recordsat their
meets this weekend.

While the women’s team debuts at ‘

roster of freshmen, the men’s side has
a more balanced mixture of young an
seasoned swimmers. - 

This could give the men’s team ‘:1
slight advantage as it prepares for the
season. _ p

“On our men’s side, we have a n.i_c,e
combination ofa small group ofincomr
ing young, very fast, very confident
freshmen who are combining with-a
very experienced older group of guys,”
Knoles said. ‘

The team will need both its young and
old athletes to perform well as it looks
to redeem itself against Buffalo, a squad
against which the Panthers didn’t fare
well last year.

The men’s team fell to Buffalo in a
close meet, 127-116, in the 2010-2011
season opener. 

“[I expect] a little bit of a revengﬁ
factor [for the men’s team] going.int/£1
the meet with Buffalo,” Knoles said.
