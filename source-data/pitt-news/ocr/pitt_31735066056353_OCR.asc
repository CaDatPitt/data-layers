In a 13-hour operation that
ended at 12:55 Monday morn-
ing, University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center transplant sur-
geons performed the world’s
second baboon-to—human liver
transplant.

“The patient is currently wak-
ing up slowly, he’s able to
open his eyes upon command
and his vital signs are stable.
His liver seems to be function-
ing at this moment,” said
Andreas G. Tzakis, associate
professor of surgery and direc-
tor of pediatric transplantation,
at a press conference Monday
morning.

According UPMC spokesper-
son Lisa Rossi, on Monday
evening the 62-year-old man
remained in critical condition
19 hours after surgery, and sur-
geons said his liver was func-
tioning well.

This patient, like the previous
baboon liver recipient, has
hepatitis B, which would infect
a human liver. Doctors say they
are confident the baboon liver
will resist infection.

According to UPMC President
Jeffrey Romoff, the second

to pay it.

recipient, unlike the first, is
HIV negative.

A number of things in the
transplant procedure were
changed based on results of the
previous xenotransplant.

Last weekend the 1993 Student Government
Board went on its annual leadership retreat.

It was ruled a huge success, but there is one
problem — a bill for an estimated $9,000 will be
coming, and the Allocations Committee has rec-
ommended denial of the funds that SGB_needs ~-- ~--

Alas, year of 1992, Pittsburgh spans lenew you well

1. Hearts torn out, thrown on
the ﬂoor and stomped on.

The Atlanta Braves tore the
hearts of Pittsburgh out by
coming back with two outs in
the bottom of the ninth inning
to eliminate the Pirates in game
seven of the National League
playoffs.

Francisco Cabrera’s pinch-hit
single off Stan Belinda drove in
the tying and winning runs and
defeated the Pirates for the
third straight time in the post-
season.

2. Streaking to the top— again.

The Pittsburgh Penguins won

 Year in Review  

 

their last 11 games in a row,
including a four-game sweep of
the Chicago Blackhawks in the
finals, to win their second
straight Stanley Cup.
3. Cowher Power.

Energized by rookie head

coach Bill Cowher, the Steelers
over-achieved their way to an
11-5 record and an AFC.Central
title.

4. Threepeat.

Despite the losses of All-Star
slugger Bobby Bonilla and 20-
game winner John Smiley, the
Pittsburgh Pirates won their
third straight National League
East championship behind mas-
terful managing by Jim Leyland.
5. Majors move.

m baboon liver transplant at UPMC

The

primary difference
between the two transplants is
the introduction of an addition-
al procedure. Surgeons took
white blood cells from the
bone marrow of the donor

baboon. The white blood cells
were then injected into the
human recipient.

“We believe the bone mar-
row infusion in the second
patient will be an extra boost

to produce chimerism and
enhance acceptance of the new
organ. The transfusion contains
the immune system cells we
believe are important for
chimerism,” Starzl said.

Chimerism occurs when cells
from the transplanted organ
become accepted by the body
of the recipient. The patient’s
system will then consist of
donor and recipient cells.
UPMC transplant surgeons say
they believe this condition is
necessary for acceptance of
donor organs.

This condition has been
found in human-to-human
transplants as well as in the
first baboon liver transplant
done last year. Baboon cells
were found “imbedded”
throughout the body of the first
baboon liver recipient, accord-
ing to Starzl.

“Immune cells from the
donor should protect the trans-
planted liver by preventing the
recipient’s immune system from
launching an attack. In addition
to their immunosuppressant
properties, we believe the
drugs also act as facilitators of
communication between the
donor and recipient immune

Expect a long wait if you're 

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

It’s a new year, a new term and
that means new books.
Approximately 6,000 students
bought books each day at the Pitt
Book Center, director Mary

Bonach said.

Although there were lines,
Bonach said that they were not as
long as in previous years.

“The lines only reached back
about halfway [the length of the
bookstore]. They used to reach all
the way to the back walls,” she
said.

She said that students have not
complained about the lines this
year.

“Students come to expect it. It
would be just as if you were
shopping during the holidays,
you expect to wait in line about
20 minutes to half an hour,” she
said.

Some students, like sophomore.

Matt Zitelli, said that the lines at

the bookstore are to be expected.

Zitelli said that the lines are a
problem that cannot be helped.
Students have to deal with them.

“There are so many students
getting their books at the same
time. All of them just cause a
huge backup,” he said.

Pitt senior Ruth Rubenstein said
she felt the delays are tolerable
for a while.

“It gets annoying after an hour,”
she said. “I get really aggravated
because I commute, and it can
throw your whole schedule off.”

Some students have sugges-
tions on how to improve book-
store backups. Senior Darcy
Henderson suggested that more
registers be added and that bigger
aisles be made for the students.

Amy Wallace, also a senior,
suggested reworking the system
so that students do not have to go
out the front door and walk all
the way around to pick up book-
bags left in the lockers near the

Pitt’s 60-plus program brings seniors back to the classroom

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Editor's Note: This is the sec-
ond part of a two part series.

In August of 1991 Carl Muck
retired from his position as
general A auditor at PPG
Industries, with the warning,
he said, from fellow retirees,
“If you don’t use your mental
faculties they’ll atrophy.”

Now Muck is using
Shakespeare and archeology to
ward off that fateful senility.

The program seems to be the
perfect answer to those who
have trouble disciplining one’s
self to study. “I had good
intentions to get books out, but
you don’t do it,” said Charles
Williams, 71, who started Pitt
in 1939 and came back last
year.

Although Williams takes
many classes he knows very
little about, others he has lived
through. _

During a history class on
WWII, he said he had to

Campus police target thieves

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Campus police have iden-
tified two male students as
suspects in unrelated resi-
dence hall thefts that
occurred last week.

Textbooks were stolen
from nine unlocked Tower A
rooms on Wednesday
evening. Police have identi-
fied a male student who was
seen going in and out of the
rooms that evening, but no
arrest has been made and
the case is still under inves-
tigation.

In a Tuesday night case,
city police caught a Pitt stu-
dent suspected in a Lothrop
Hall theft while he was
spraypainting the side of
Parkvale Savings Bank.

Earlier in the night, five
compact discs were stolen
from a female student’s
room in Lothrop hall, and

campus police had identified
the suspect but had not
located him. The police
were saved the trouble
when the CDs were discov-
ered on the intoxicated stu-
dent when city police col-
lared him in the spraypaint-
ing.

Unlike the Thanksgiving
burglaries in Holland Hall,
in which someone used a
key to enter several student
rooms, the recent thefts
were all committed in rooms
that were left unlocked.

Since the Holland Hall
burglaries, which occurred
in the same rooms during
two Thanksgiving breaks in
a row, the university has
been looking into enhanced
security measures in the
buildings, according to a
memo sent last month from
Assistant Vice Chancellor for

Business John DeVitto to‘

Holland Hall residents.

sor talked about places he had
been stationed in. Although
some professors encourage the
older students to speak out in
class, they are encouraged
when they join the program
not to “hog up” the classes.
Shirley Levine, who is in her
late 605, now has a lot in com-
mon with her 5-year-old
granddaughter Marrisa. Now
when they visit, they can both
ask each other about what they
learned in school that day.

Many of the older students
take classes “just for fun” and
those classes that they never
got to when they were in
school — like Hamilton, a for-
mer physicist taking Spanish
conversation and Carl Muck, a
former certified public accoun-
tant, taking Shakespeare.

But for Fazekas it was a
dream come true._When she
graduated from high school in
the midst of the Depression,
there was the motivation but

» not the money for her father to

send her to Pitt. Her hopes to
go to college diminished even
further when her father died in
1939, a few months after buy-
ing her a typewriter she could
use in college.

Through the 60-Plus Program
that dream and her father’s
wish have become a reality.
Looking back at her first day at
Pitt only five years ago, she
said, “I got off the bus and as I
walked up the stone steps, I
thought to myself, ‘look at me
Dad, I finally made it.”’

Pitt students with the
radio dial set to 100.7 had a
big shock when they came
back after break.

Instead of hearing the lat-
est from Boyz II Men or En
Vogue, they were hearing
the unmistakable sounds of
country music.

Nothing was wrong with
the stereo. WMXP — Mix

Jamz — went off the air at
one in the morning on New
Year’s Day. Although the
call letters are the same, the
format is country western,
much to the chagrin of its
former listeners.

The station was lease—pur-
chased by E.Z.
Communications, the same
company which owns
WBZZ, B-94.

At first the new format
called for country singer

—were assured that it is for

Garth Brooks, and only
Garth, 24 hours a day.
However, its format has
expanded to include other
country crooners.

No warning was given ‘
before the change in own-
ership and format occurred.
Managers at the station said
that many listeners of Mix

change was a joke, but

good.

Retreat

Continued from page 1
Activities advisors, despite
their knowledge of the com-
rnittee’s denial.

During the allocations
process last spring, a total
request of $5,000 was
approved by the committee
for. this annual retreat. After
Brody was elected president,
he decided to add gover-
nance group presidents and
SGB committee chairs to the
guest list. This, added to his
choice of the retreat location,
did not fit into the allotted

* budget. Brody then made an

emergency request for addi-
tional funding.

Since the trip was planned
by Brody and the Student
Activities Administration,
newly elected board members
did not vote either in favor or
in opposition of the retreat
and its price tag. .

“My opinion is that it wa
perfect for the type~'of retreat
that we needed -— to get
away and do what we felt
was necessary,” Brody said.

“We got a total package.

We got everything included
and it was a great deal in
comparison with other
retreats,” Brody said in
defense of the choice of
Nemacolin Woodlands.

According to Allocations
Chair Lisa Waslo, the costs for
lodging the SGB retreat at the
mountain resort was $129-
$169 per person per day.
Lodging costs at either
Embassy Suites or Courtyard
Marriott was estimated at $69
and $49 per day plus meals,
respectively.

“[Embassy Suites] wasn’t set
up in a way that I felt was
going to be proper for the
kind of discussions that were
going to be going on,” Brody
said. “It’s a hotel, and the
things they provided.was not
what was necessary for the
new board and committee
chairs.”

Brody said that the
Allocations’ recommendation
should have been discussed
and voted on at the last meet-
ing of the 1992 SGB in
December, but the meeting

was cancelled due to snow.

The funding request that
the committee received from
Brody was sent back for a
revision, Waslo said.

Brody made several revi-
sions including reducing the
number of facilitators and
doubling up people in rooms
and sent it back to the com-
mittee. The revisions actually
increased the cost of the
retreat by around $30 without
including Dr. Harmon’s deci-
sion to absorb transportation
costs.

On Dec. 18, Waslo sentia
letter to Brody and members
of Student Activities
Administration. This letter
again stated Allocations’
denial of the revision.

In her letter, Waslo stated
that the need for additional
funds was not mainly a result
from taking extra people but
primarily from the location.

“The committee evaluated
the requests for this retreat at
every level — total cost, cost
per person, etc. — when they
were originally submitted. At

that time,
requested that the Student
Government Board attempt to
economize and minimize the
cost to the best of their abili-
ty,” she said.

Brody said that he was not
in the SGB office much dur-
ing the last week of the fall
term because of finals, so he
did not receive the letter.
Over the break, he traveled to

his home overseas and was‘

not able to work on this
retreat. ’ A

When he returned from
break, Brody said that the
retreat had to commence
because, “The trip is neces-
sary to the workings of the
board. If it doesn’t happen,

g the board does not work.”

Cancellation of the retreat
was never an option, he said.
The group bussed out
Friday Jan. 8 at noon to
Nemacolin Woodlands, a
resort south of Pittsburgh
“nestled in the Laurel

Mountains” to begin setting A

goals, learning about student

, government and tohbond.

The group of 28 that left
Oakland on Friday consisted
of the SGB members, exclud-
ing Thomas Grassia (because
of a prior commitment), the

Allocations Committee and
SGB committee chairs. On

Saturday morning,
Governance Board presidents
were shuttled out to

Nemacolin and they left along
with the committee chairs
later that day. Twenty people
remained at the resort for
Saturday night.

Several board members said
they had no idea where they
were going or how much it
was costing. Brody said the
reason for them not knowing
the location was so friends
would not show up.

When asked if they were
shocked when they got there,
board member Brian Bolton

‘replied, “Yes. Wouldn't you

be if four guys in tuxes
opened the door for you?” ’

Board member Joe Foner
said that ‘his clothes were
picked up off of the floor by
housekeeping and folded.

According to Waslo,
Nemacolin Woodlands was of
“no practical value.” Two
people shared a two—story
condo with two bedrooms, a
living room, a kitchen, a
bathroom and a washer and
dryer.

system cells,” said JohnJ. Fung,
associate professor of surgery
and chief of transplantation.

Starzl said one day a similar
procedure (in both human and
xenotransplants) may be per-
formed on an organ donor
prior to transplant, increasing
the similarities between the two
different bodily environments.

Another change is the inser-
tion of a tube into the 1iver’s
primary duct, which will
extend out of the patient’s
body. This was done for two
reasons.

In the previous xenotrans-
plant, it was found that the
ducts had become blocked.
The tube will allow the ducts to
be flushed clear should this
problem occur in the second
transplant. 0

The second reason is this will

permit diagnostic studies, such
as liver biopsies, to be per-
formed without the use of
intrusive surgical procedures.
Liver biopsies were performed
on the first xenotransplant
recipient. These procedures
increase the risk of infection to
the transplant patient with a
suppressed immune system.

 

SGB

Conﬁned from page 1
the estimated $9,000 retreat.
New board leader Jacob
Brody tabled any board dis-
cussion of the matter until the
total cost of the weekend was
available.

Former SGB President Gil
Golden spoke out at the
meeting, asking Brody when
the issue would be discussed
since _the weekend had
already occurred and the
money had already been
spent despite Allocation’s
denial of additional funding.

Golden said he was speak-
ing out for the undergradu-
ates paying the Student
Activities fee, which, if
approved by the board, will
fund the retreat.

“Administration does not

make Allocation SGB deci-

sions,” he said. “This is stu-

dents’ money that was spent

 without due process.”
Waslo told Brody, “The

_SGB has the Allocations

Committee for the purpose of
researching and making rec-

ommendations, and you
either do or do not want to
hear what we have to say. If
you do not want to hear what
we have to say, then I sug-
gest you get rid of us all.”

Newly-elected President
pro tempore Ted Schroeder
defended the SGB weekend.

“I don’t think this weekend
should be seen as an
overindulgence of the Student
Government Board or as any
special treatment of our-
selves,” Schroeder said. “The
value of the retreat for the
board should not be clouded
by. financial concerns, which,
while relevant, are being
blown a little out of propor-
tion here.”

Last year’s retreat, accord-
ing to both Golden and
Waslo, cost about $5,800.

“I think last year’s retreat
was very effective and rela-
tively inexpensive,” Golden
said. “There’s a lot of busi-
ness. But when you think
about it, where can you have
meetings? The obvious

answer is almost anywhere.”

SGB advisor Joyce
Giangarlo, who worked with
Brody in planning the week-
end, said that various
research was done in select-
ing Nemacolin Woodlands.

“We looked for an environ-
ment that was really con-
ducive for team building, “
Giangarlo said. “Jacob had a
very high goal of com-
munication. He’s done some-
thing that we have not done
for 10 years. He took the
committee chairs and also
invited governance group
chairs.

“While our budget numbers
appear higher, they appear
higher because we’re talking
about an invitational for an
additional 14 people,” she
said. “That can inﬂate any-
thing.” '

Giangarlo, who is also
assistant director of Student
Activities, said that other
student groups on campus
go on retreats, and that many
of these groups use the same

places as SGB.

“The prices with Nemacolin
are absolutely in line with
every place else [SGB] has
ever been,” she said. “You
can’t put a dollar figure on
the value of training and team
building and communication
skills.” _

As for Allocation’s denial of
funding, Giangarlo said it is
the first time she has seen
this happen in at least 12
years.

“Allocations raised some
concerns over the cost of the
event, but in the past,
Allocations and SGB have
had a history of taking the
last year’s retreat budget,
submitting that as the
[new] budget, and then letting
it ride until after the event.”

Giangarlo said that the
group usually readjusts the
budget after the weekend is
over.

“We’ve always overspent
that amount [allocated] and
we’ve always cleared it up on
the far end,” she said.

“Oh what a tangled web we weave when President Jacob
Brodypracttca to deceive.”

Following the lines of other people who have adorned
the title “president,” Jacob Brody is determined to place
himself among the notorious — Wesley Posvar and Richard
Nixon are two who immediately come to mind.

H_appy new year President Brody and new members of
the Student Government Board who were able to skirt the
system. At least Presidents’ Reagan and Nixon had the
sense -to wait until the second term to scandalize the White
House.

During the SGB allocations process last spring, SGB asked
for a total of $5,000 for its annual leadership retreat. The
retreat was regarded as necessary by Brody because it
would allow SGB members, governance and committee
chairs to bond, get to know one another and work together
without any diversions.

After the election, the place where the retreat would be
held and the number of people going was determined.
Apparently $5,000 was not enough for Nemacolin
Woodlands, so an amount of emergency money was
requested. The Allocations Committee ﬁrst asked for a revi-
sion of the emergency request and once it received the revi-
sion, the committee denied it. Since most of this took place
dun'ng a hectic time of the school year, the last two weeks
of the term, Brody did not see the letter of denial until after
break. So all of the resort plans went through.

The problem here is not that the $5,000’ was spent at a_
posh resort. However, this fact is sure toupset more than a
few people. What Brody did, with the help of the adrninis-
tration, was ﬁnd a loophole in the allocations process and
exploit it — proceed with the plans after he was already
denied the money. And while he states that he went along
with the plans because he didn’t know of the cancellation
until it was too late, his excuses are feeble.

Former SGB President Gil Golden told The Pitt News that
if Brody wanted to cancel the plans he could have done so
quite easily.

Moreover, Brody’s actions disgusted many of his col-
leagues on SGB. Brian Bolton, Tom Grassia, Joseph Foner
and Allocations Committee Chair Lisa Waslo did not
approve of Brody’s decision. And all expressed outrage.
Most importantly though, none of them were consulted
about the decision.

Although such actions require serious repercussions, we
are not about to call for the resignation of Mr. Brody. He is
however off to an extremely bad start. Either the Student

Government Board itself or, more appropriately, a special

task force should be assigned to investigate the course of
action and motives behind Brody’s irresponsible decision
making. If Brody’s decisions were found to be intentional
and irresponsible then he should feel the full impact of the
law. And if that means impeachment, then so be it.

Paradise found on the Jersey shore

‘The hey to life is one thing. You
ﬁnd out what that one thing is and
you don't need anything else.”

— Curley from the movie City
Slickers

It was a long walk -down the
maroon—carpeted hallway on that
night of Dec. 31. At a time when
inter-ethnic conﬂict is seemingly
more the rule than the exception,
I saw people of different races,
social classes, religions and colors
walking together in peace. It was
quite a turn from what I’m used to
seeing on the television and read-
ing in the newspapers these days.
For the moment Somalia ceased to
exist, the Serbs and Croats were at
peace and Los Angeles was a bas-
tion of equality. The words of
Rodney King had finally come to
fruition. Everybody was “just get-
ting along.” .

It had to be Utopia, I thought to
myself, as people of all colors and
races walked together with the
same goals in mind. Down that
long, deep hallway (what I now
refer to as the pathway to peace)
there were Romanesque fountains,
Victorian chandeliers and glittering
gold railings. It was a cerebral
moment for all as the heavens
seemed finally upon us.-T here
were voices at a distance and a
shining, almost blinding light at
the end of the hallway.

Ever since the fall of
humankind, we have sought to
return to the idyllic state represent-
ed by the Garden of Eden. Sir
Thomas Moore, Plato and Ponce
de Leon all sought it; academics,
poets and theologians are still
writing about it; and thousands
upon thousands of people visit
Graceland each year in the hope
of seeing the resurrection of their
savior Elvis. Despite their monu-
mental struggles the quest has
proven to be in vain.

That is, of course, until Dec. 31,
1992, when I, along with thou-
sands of others, found paradise.
Oddly enough it begins with a 12-
story parking garage at the New
Jersey Shore and a purple, green
and red neon sign that bears the

words “Tn1mp’s Taj Mahal.”

I’ll admit that it’s kind of strange
that I found paradise in New
Jersey — home of toll booths, big
hair and toxic waste. It exists,
however, and even more strangely
it exists in Atlantic City. Amidst the
drugs, prostitution and crime that

Brett
0

Grlrnan
run rampant through this town it
just goes to show that paradise
can be found in the oddest of
places.

As I walked through the casino,
I saw all types of people. Yet,
through it all there was not a
‘sneer nor a condescending glance
from anyone. Most important,
though, was the sense of unity
which pervaded the atmosphere.
We all had a common goal and
were united by one thing —

greed.
The admirable struggles against

racism, hatred and war suddenly,

seemed futile to me. Cries of “ﬁnd
the peace, stop killing and love
one another” were reality. For the
first time in my life people existed
together, and differences meant
nothing. No doubt that there is a
certain amount of irony involved
in'the fact that something usually
viewed as so divisive and with
contempt, can be a binding force
behind all of us.

Contrary to what many believe,

‘the fact that greed binds us togeth-

er is hardly a bad thing — espe-
cially the kind ofgreed of which I
am speaking. This greed was not
about screwing one another but
about screwing the system. A
marked distinction if there ever
was one. Me against the slot

   

machine. Me against the cards. Me
against the roll of the dice — a
struggle not against the entrepre-
neur of the casino but a struggle
against the uncertainty of a sys-
tem.

Unity, I guess can be found in

the funniest of places.

III****

We were approaching 11:59
p.m.

I told the old woman standing
next to me to watch.

“What ball,” the elderly woman
asked, ignoring the large screen
television (and no doubt the rest
of the world) that broadcasted the
events from Times Square. “Let it
fall she said. I’m more interested
in three bars or cherries lining up
in a row.”

On Jan. 1, 1993, at 12:02 A.M,

the elderly woman next to me

screamed “Happy new year!” It
didn't matter that she was two
minutes late. I looked over and
saw three triple bars lined up in a
row. Her face glowed, and at once
she was a small child. The little
girl was playing a game. trying to
collect as many quarters in her
cup, before they clanked against
the tin tray which they fall against.

Now, it seemed I was at the
fountain of youth.

She caught about half of them
in her cup and smiled —— expos-
ing the few teeth she had left in
her mouth. “Happy new year,”
she repeated.

I smiled back at her and echoed

"those words. I initially thought to

myself, as I looked at the old
woman, “How many social securi-
ty checks did she blow to win
those 2,000 quarters?” It didn’t
matter. She started out the new
year a winner, and everything she
had lost prior was forgotten.

I walked away having lost $10. I
tumed and wished the old woman
luck. She started again. One quar-
ter after the next. The machine
didn’t care whether or not she was
wealthy, 80 years old and a
woman. And she didn’t care about
anything else but three triple bars.

Happy New Year.

Basketball tries t° end Ice heats up in second season

road Woes, dog Huskies

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

Comingoff a disappointing
loss to St. John’s last weekend,
the Pitt basketball team enters
the Hartford Civic Center
tonight trying to shake the
memories of the Redmen loss
with a new vision win over
Connecticut.

That will not be easy for Pitt
(9-2, 2-2 Big East). The
Huskies are a perfect 5-0 at
home this season and are led
by an experienced senior and
a trio of splendid sophomores
that have sparked the team to
a 7-2 start.

Senior guard Scott Burrell is
the “top dog” for Connecticut
(7-2, 2-1 Big East). He is aver-
aging 17.7 points per game
and has become accustomed
to playing the guard spot that
he was moved to a year ago.
Burrell has played an average
of 33 minutes per game and
he has a total of 31 steals. The
Huskie co-captain was also
touted as a preseason All-
America pick as well as a pre-
season All-Big East selection.

The next “dogs” in line are
the sophomores. Forward
Donyell Marshall is averaging
16.4 points per game, and this
production comes from one of
the three great recruits that
Huskie Coach Jim Calhoun
brought into Connecticut two
years ago. The other two are
sophomores Brian Fair and
Donny Marshall.

Fair has exploded on the
scene this year with a 41 per-
cent three-point shooting aver-
age and has jumped his offen-
sive game from 6.3 ppg. to
15.9 ppg. The shooting guard
has also given Connecticut a
potent outside game.

Marshal1’s game has also
turned on the offensive jets.
The offside forward has aver-
aged 74 ppg. and has round-

ed out Calhoun’s tremendous
recruiting class.

Starting these four solid
players, tho Huskies are aver-

aging 80.6 ppg. and are look-.

ing to keep the Panthers from
winning at the Hartford Civic
Center for fourth straight year
(Pitt last won there in 1988).

Pitt should have a good
chance to break that losing
streak this year, even though
the Panthers are 0-2 on the
road so far in this young sea-
son. Point guard Jerry
McCullough should be able to
move the ball well and drive
the lane at will.

Center Eric Mobley and for-
ward Chris McNeal should
control the boards against the
Huskies. Averaging 9.2
rebounds per game and 8.3
rpg. respectively, both should
dominate a Connecticut team
that has only Marshall grab-
bing an average of six boards
every time out.

On the outside Pitt has been
up and down. McCullough has
been the hot shooter some-
times and junior Marlon
Rhymes and first-year player
Garrick Thomas have filled in
admirably. But overall the
Panthers need to be more con-
sistent to win road games like
the one they will play tonight.

Mobley, McNeal and Chris
Gant should find a definite
height advantage inside.
Pounding away at a shorter
Huskie team could be the key
to a Panther win.

But Calhoun’s teams have
done well against Pitt head
coach Paul Evans. The
Huskies had beaten Pitt at
Fitzgerald Field House two out
of the last three times and
have held the Panthers at bay
for the last four years at the
Hartford Civic Center. Pitt and
Evans hope to change that
tonight, as well as their road
game misfortune.

Point guard Jerry McCullough has been ﬂying high for the Panthers this season.

By Jim Lakely
Managing Editor

Sean Miller.

For Jerry McCullough, getting past
those two small, but legendary words
would be tougher than dribbling around
any opponent.

McCullough has the enormous task of

coming out of the shadow of a legend,
and failure would cast that shadow over
him again. .

But the man they call “Ice” has met
that challenge with a cool composure
and has emerged to become the best
point guard in the Big East.

And he is only a sophomore.

The men’s indoor track
team got some needed expe-
rience against some stiff
competition as the team ran
in its second meet of the
season at the Diamond

George Mason University on
Saturday.

The Panthers’ field a very
young squad this year, but
one that is very talented.

Williams hurdles competition in
Women's track season opener

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Allison Williams ran to a first
place finish in the 55-meter hurdles, edg-
ing Nikki Inglis from Syracuse in Pitt’s
first women’s indoor track meet this
year.

In addition to being Pitt’s only first
place finish in the meet, Williams’ time
of 7.81 seconds qualified her for the

, NCAA division finals in the 55-meter hur-

dles.

“I am very pleased with Allison
Williams’ performance,” Pitt women’s
Coach Steve Lewis said. “There was
tough competition at the meet, and her
time was exceptional.”

Williams’ run was part of the women’s
track team’s first meet ofthe season, the
Father Diamond Memorial held at George
Mason University on Saturday.

It was a non-scoring meet, but featured
several teams the Lady Panthers could

’ gauge themselves against to determine

where they are at this point in the sea-
son.

Joanne Warner was a major contributor
for Pitt, placing fifth in the 20—pound
throw. She threw for an eighth place fin-

ish in the shot-put. Ayne Allen raced to
an. eighth place finish in the 400-meter
dash and Lakeya Smith finished 11th.

The 10 teams participating at George
Mason included Big East rivals
Georgetown, Syracuse and Villanova as
well as several SEC teams. Defending Big
East champion Georgetown had nine
competitors finish either first or second
in their events, as did Villanova,

“Georgetown and Villanova had very
good teams last year, and we saw that
they are strong again this year,” Lewis
said. “We only had seven ladies compet-
ing, and I am satisfied with their perfor-
mances.”

Lewis said that the meet could not

V be used as an evaluation of this year’s

ind‘oor track team since only
seven athletes from the team went to the
meet.

He expects to get a better look. in the
upcoming weeks at the ability of this
year’s indoor team. ~

According to Lewis, this weekend is
especially important to find out how far
the team is from being a contender.

The Lady Panthers will travel to Ohio
State to face midwest powers Tennessee
State, Kentucky and Ohio State.

Pitt hockey slashes
Stars in 8-4 victory

By Tom Schneider
.Stq0"Wn’ter

In perhaps its most impressive
performance of the season, the Pit
Hockey Club overcame early two-
goal deﬁcits and rolled to an 8-4
victory over the Steel City Stars in
Haimorville on Saturday.

The Panther victory avenged a
previous loss to the Stars on Nov.
14. .

The addition, some new faces
helped the team’s offensive pro-
duction this time around, as new-
comers Tony Trovato and Marc
Reiter each scored four points in
the game. Team scoring leader Bill
Crousey continued to score points
at an unbelievable pace, notching
three goals and one assist in
Satuiday’s game. Pitts ironman has
ﬁgured in on 11 of the 15 goals
that the Panthers have scored
againstthe Staisintwogmesthis
year.

The game itself got off to an
inauspicious start as the Stars took
advantage. of defensive lapses mid-
way through‘ the first period by

first in the Adams Division. The
Penguins are establishing them-
selves as a great team —-— regular
season as well as postseason.
These -are just a few things to
ponder in a review of the first
half of the season.

MOST SURPRISING TEAM:
Tampa Bay Lightning. For an
expansion team, Tampa Bay has
played remarkably well. Led by
Brian Bradley and Chris Kontos,
the Lightning still have an out-
side shot for the fourth and final
playoff spot in the Norris
Division. -

MOST DISAPPOINTING
TEAMS: St. Louis and the New
York Rangers. St. Louis has been
singing the Blues (sorry, had to
get that in) this year and the
team finds itself battling just to
get a playoff spot. But superstar

— Brett Hull has started to recover
from an early season slump, and .
the Blues might be able to oust A

Toronto in the second half for a
playoff spot.

The Rangers are a huge disap-
pointment. This was a team
many picked to win the Stanley
Cup. So what have the Rangers
done? Absolutely nothing.

Cowher/Leyland parallel spells to-playoff doom

Different sport, same sce-
nario.'

The distinguished coach of
the black and gold has the
wrong guy throwing the ball in
the playoffs and the team goes
on vacation early.

In October it was Pirate man-
ager Jim Leyland, arguably the
best in the game, calling on
Stan “Boom boom” Belinda to
save the Bucs in game seven
of the National League
Playoffs. Stan was not the man
as he blew it, and the Braves
went on to the World Series.

This time it was Steeler head

, coach Bill Cowher, who did a

great job taking a team that
was mediocre last year to the
best record in the AFC this
year. He then turned the
team’s playoff hopes over to
quarterback Neil O’Donnell,
and the Steelers were eliminat-
ed in the first round by the
Bills, 24-5.

The sense of impending
doom began as a struggling
O’Donnell broke his right fibu-
la in a game against the Seattle
Seahawks. Veteran Bubby
Brister took over. The offense

was terrible the next two
weeks in losses against the
Chicago Bears and Minnesota
Vikings. The Bubster was
blamed despite the fact that his
receivers often looked as if
they couldn’t catch a cold if a
glacier ran over them. 2
O’Donnell nearly returned
for the season finale against
Cleveland, but Brister again got
the call. He did his part with

an outstanding game against a_

solid Brown defense. Cowher
left little doubt that no matter
what happened, O’Donnell
was his man and would start
when he got healthy.

Unlike Leyland, Cowher had
options. Leyland’s entire
bullpen was a. mess, so one
could argue that he had little
choice other than Belinda.
Cowher had a veteran quarter-
back in Brister. He had a quar-
terback who was healthy, who
had just played about as good
a game as a Steeler quarter-
back had played all year and
one who had not only played
in the postseason before but
had success. During the last
two years of mediocrity, many

had forgotten Brister’s strong
play in the 1989 playoffs.
Cowher chose to ask
O’Donnell to make his first-
ever appearance in postseason
after not playing for five
weeks. Even before going out

  Ryan
Buncher

with the injury, O’Donnell
hadn’t had a ‘good game in
about a month.

The results were no surprise.

First Steeler possession: After
the defense stuffed the Bills on
fourth—and-one at the
Pittsburgh 45, it drove deep

into Buffalo territory. But

O’Donnell took a sack on
third-and—four and the Steelers
settled for a 58-yard Gary
Anderson field goal.

Second possession: The
Steelers had the ball at the
Buffalo 41, and O’Donnell was
picked off by Nate Odomes.

The pass was tipped, but
O’Donnell was throwing into
coverage anyway.

Third possession; Pittsburgh
had a second-and-seven at the
Bill 54 and O’Donnell fumbles
after a Bruce Smith sack.
Buffalo goes 59 yards on nine
plays for a touchdown, a pass
from Frank Reich to lineman
Mitch Frerotte, to take a 7-3
lead.

O’Donnell did move the
team just before halftime, but
underthrew Ernie Mills on the
right sideline and was inter-
cepted.

There was speculation all
week that Brister would
replace O’Donnell if he strug-
gled in the first half, but
Cowher never made the
change as the Steelers were
shut out in the second half.
O’Donnell hit on 15 of 29 pass-
es on the day for 165 yards,
two interceptions and no
touchdowns. He also fumbled
twice and was sacked seven
times. Most importantly, the
Pittsburgh offense only scored
three points despite another
100—yard effort by Barry Poster.

The loss was not entirely
anybody’s fault. The Bills got
away with an illegal pick play
on Frerotte’s touchdown.
Richard Shelton had an inter-
ception in his hands with noth-
ing but open space in front of
him, but dropped it. On the
next play, Bills’ receiver James
Lofton burned Sammy Walker,
playing in place of injured. All-
Pro cornerback Rod Woodson,
for a touchdown that boosted
the Buffalo lead to 14-3.

As usual, Steeler receivers
dropped a few passes, the pass
protection was weak, and the
defense never got much of a
pass rush all day. The special
teams got in a mistake too, as
holder Mark Royals muffed a
snap on a field goal attempt,
costing the team a shot at three
points.

More than anything, it was
an ineffective passing game
that cost the Steelers a spot in
the AFC championship game,
something they could have had
if their quarterback had given
them a chance to win.

Dixon finished with a

In the field events, it was
two of the few upperclass—
man on the team, junior
Jim Monk and senior,Dave

the Panthers.

Senay placed fourth in
the shot—put with a toss of
48 feet, 2 1/2 inches and
sixth place in the 35 pound

of 43-10 1/2”.

Monk placed fifth in the
shot—put with a throw of

“Jim just had an off day.
He could have placed a lot
higher,” Vasvary said.

Since this meet didn’t
offer any long distance
events the distance runners
used this meet as an
opportunity to work on
their sprinting.

“Our distant runners ran
in events like the mile so

they could work on their
speed,” Vasvary said.

Vasvary said the team
performed pretty well con-
sidering it had just one
week of practice after com-
ing back from winter break
to prepare for this meet.

The Panthers now have
one week to prepare for
a meet when they will
travel to Ohio State

1:39 left in the period, when
DiSanti beat a Stars player to
a loose puck in the offen-
sive ZL."‘P. and directed it to
Reiter, who in tum punched
it into the wide open net.

Then, with just 30 sec-
onds left in the period,
Reiter broke the Stars back
with a goal, assisted by
DiSanti and Trovato, that
gave Pitt its first lead of the
game at 5-4 and effectively
ended the game.

After the start of the third
period it was evident that
Reiter’s second goal com-
pletely took the Stars out of
the game. Barely one
minute ran off the clock
before Crousey found a
loose puck between the cir—
cles and uncorked a slap-
shot that never saw a piece
of Stars’ goalie Frank
Mastandrea. The Panthers
led by two, 6-4.

Pitt increased its lead to 7-
4 with a stunning individual
play by Reiter. He took a
pass from Crousey, entered
the Stars zone, weaved
around a defender, came in
on goal unmolested and
turned goalie Mastandrea
inside-out before tallying his
third goal of the night.

NHL

Continued from page 10

While they have been
between second and third in «the
Patrick Division, the Rangers
have not played real well, due
largely in part to the inept coach-
ing of ‘Roger Neilson. Neilson
would sit players like Phil
Bourque and Randy Gilhen
while ‘letting goons Tie Domi
(now with Winnipeg) and Joey
Kocur play.

At least general manager
Neil Smith came to his senses
and dumped Neilson recently.

But the damage he caused to
this Stanley Cup “contender”
may remain for the rest of the
season, as the chants of “1940,
1940” will fill the air come
spring.

MOST SURPRISING PLAY-
ERS: Bradley and Kontos,
Tampa Bay. These two castoffs
have found a home with the
Lightning. Both have a shot at
playing in the all-star game.

MOST DISAPPOINTING
PLAYERS: Brett Hull, St. Louis
and Eric Lindros, Philadelphia.
Hull, who has led the NHL in

' goals the past three seasons, has

had trouble finding the net with-
out set—up man Adam Oates,
now with Boston.

Things have gone so bad for

Hull that he’s been bumped to

the Blues second line.

Hull has recovered recently
and he’s starting to score again.

Lindros is just a rookie, but for
all of the publicity he has
received, he should play a lot
better than one.

Unless he can score 100 points
his rookie year (or average a
number that would come to
100), there’s no reason to speak
of him as being in the same class
as Mario Lemieux or Wayne
Gretzky.

LEAGUE MVP: _ Mario
Lemieux, Pittsburgh. Until a
recent absence from the lineup
due to his back, a relatively
healthy Lemieux has dom-
inated the league this season
leading the Penguins to the
NHL’s best record.

With over 100 points in -the
first half, Lemieux could have
had a shot to break Gretzky’s
scoring record of 215 points in a
season, but with his current back
injury that will cause Lemieux to
miss at least two weeks,
Gretzky’s record may be safe.
Still, Lemieux’s current point
totals place him over 30 points
ahead of the pack in scoring.

Some consideration must be
given to Los Angeles’ Jari Kurri
and Bradley of Tampa Bay.

While filling in for Gretzky,

Kurri has changed positions and
rebounded from a weak 1991—’92
season.

Bradley is on pace for over
100 points with an expansion
team. That says a lot for the for-
mer Toronto center.

BEST DEFENSEMAN: Al
Iafrate, Washington. Iafrate start-
ed the year off slowly, but he’s
been on fireas of late, and he’s
the number one reason why the
Capitals have rebounded from a
poor start.

Some consideration must be
given to Paul Coffey of the
Kings. Coffey continues to pile
up points and he’s a plus player
despite his oft-maligned defen-
sive play.

BEST GOALTENDER: Tom
Barrasso, Pittsburgh; Mike
Vernon, Calgary and Ed Belfour,
Chicago.

When you boil it down in
sports, wins are what really
matters, and Barrasso leads
the league with them. He has
played much more consistently

. during the regular season for

Pittsburgh, and he hasn’t “taken
the night off’ as he may have in
the past. a
Vernon, the human trade
rumor, is still in Calgary. He’s a
big reason why the Flames have
gone from fifth to first in only a

year. .

Belfour has led the
Blackhawks to first in the Norris.
Despite a slow start, he leads the
league in shutouts.

ROOKIE OF THE YEAR:
Teemu Selanne, Winnipeg.
Selanne, not Lindros, has been
the dominant rookie in the
league this year. The dazzling
offensive force leads all rookies
with goals.

Some consideration should go
to Boston’s Joe Juneau, Lindros

"of Philadelphia and Shawn

McEachem of Pittsburgh.

MOST LIKELY TO BE TRAD-
ED: Phil Housley, Winnipeg.
Housley’s having contract prob-
lems with the Jets, and Detroit
has shown an interest in the
high-scoring defenseman.

Grant Fuhr, Toronto. With the
emergence of goalie phenom
Felix Potvin, the aging and oft-
injured netminder has become
expendable, with Buffalo as a
possible destination.

John MacLean, New Jersey.
After missing last year with an
injury, the former 40-goal scorer
has lost‘his‘ scoring touch. His
playing time has been cut and
he’s already refused an “invita—
tion” to the minors.

He has used hisunmatched quickness to drive into
