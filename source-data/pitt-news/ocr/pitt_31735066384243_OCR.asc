House Rejects Tax Increase Bill By H 2-75 Vote

ByMARKMURPHY

Pill News Staff Writer
The Pennsylvania House of
Representatives Monday rejected
for the ﬁrst time a bill requiring a
tax increase raising part of the
funds necessary to provide aid to

state-related institutions.

The bill, passed by the Senate
Thursday, would raise the personal
income tax rate from two percent to
2.1 percent and increase the

Med Schools
Admit Use of

Quota System

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

HARRISBURG——Three of Penn-
sylvania’s eight medical schools
reserve places in their classes for
students from six rural colleges who
are interested in practicing in
doctor-short areas, medical school
deans said yesterday.

The other ﬁve medical schools
said they have no quotas of any
kind.

Representatives from the medical
schools were called before the
Senate Appropriations Committee
to explain the special enrollment
programs.

“I don’t like the term ‘slots,’ ”

"i::{"said Dr. Joseph DiPalma, dean of

the Hahnemann Medical College
and Hospital. _
“It has a connotation to it.

They’re outreach programs to aid in.

corporate net income tax from 9.5
percent to 11 percent. The two taxes
would raise about $159 million that,
along with a proposed new tax on
electric power generated in Penn-
sylvania (but consumed elsewhere)
and some cuts in the budget,
could provide the nearly $300
million needed to fund state-related
universities.

Pitt is slated to receive $61.7
million when the monies are raised.

Voting closely along party lines,
the House felled the tax plan by a
vote of 112-75. All 75 yes votes came
from Democrats, while 82 Republi-
cans joined 30 Democrats in voting
no. A minimum of 102 votes are
needed for passage.

Immediately after defeating the
plan, the House passed a proposal
to reconsider the vote, thus paving
the way for other tallies.

A second vote may produce a

different result, or just may bring
the two vote counts closer together.
Eleven democrats were recorded as
not participating Monday, and
many are expected to O.K. the
package when they do cast their
votes.

Additionally, some Republicans
reportedly have indicated a willing-
ness to vote for the tax increase if
the corporate tax is lessened. The
proposed 11 percent tax on

Task Force To Study

, Alcohol Abuse Here   

By SUE McFARLAND

A new University Task Force on
Responsible Drinking is preparing
to delve into the drinking habits of

 , more than 2,000 Pitt students.

2?‘

s-“The task force, which was

organized officially in September,
will soon distribute a survey to
determine the amount of irrespon-
sible drinking on the Pitt campus.

Irresponsible drinking, as termed
by the task force, is “Irresponsible
alcohol use that leads to negative
consequences, such as academic
difficulty and destruction of Univer-
sity property.”

The task force, according to
various members, plans to develop

alcohol abuse. The task force is

‘chaired by Rabbi Joseph H. Levine,

director of the B’nai Brith Hillel
Jewish University Center, and its
members are representatives from
the Office of Residence Life (ORL),
the campus police department, the
University Counseling Center, Stu-
dent Health Services, the Drug and
Alcohol Abuse Clinic of Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC) and faculty members
specializing in medicine, psychiatry
and education.

Tim Snyder, assistant director of
ORL, expressed concern over the
apparent increase in drinking in the
dorms.

Tax Increase
By 37 Votes

week’s student mass rally in,
Harrisburg, could be forthcoming.
That rally was followed two days
later by Senate passage of a tax
increase, an action that, according
to Student Government Board
president Bernie Payne, was
affected by the rally.

“I think the student rally had a lot
of effect,” Payne said. “It had a
substantial effect in changing the
votes of senators Corman and
Nolan.”

Payne believes, however, the
rally did little to change views in tlﬁ,
House.

“Most of the protest was directed
toward the Senate,” Payne said.
“The House has really felt like it’s
safe, but it’s next.”

the distribution of physicians in the
state and improve health care in
outlying areas.”

But he acknowledged that the
programs were very advantageous
for the undergraduate colleges.

If students know a certain college
has an agreement with a medical
school, the college will have a
recruiting advantage, DiPalma
indicated. ‘

Hahnemann has agreements that
could give 70 of its 180 places to
students from four Pennsylvania
colleges: Wilkes in Wilkes-Barre,
Lehigh in Allentown, Gannon in
Erie and Widener in Chester.

Jefferson Medical School has a
rural doctor program that eventual-
ly will reserve up to 12 places for
Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
and 12 other places for any students
interested in rural family practice.

Both Jefferson and the Medical
College of Pennsylvania have
accelerated programs, with Penn
State and Lehigh, respectively.
Students are admitted out of ‘high
school, and finish the normal eight
years of college and medical school
in six years.

All three medical schools said
they tend to favor Pennsylvania
residents over out of state students.
Jefferson does reserve 20 places for
students from Delaware.

The University of Pittsburgh,

Hershey Medical Center and the

Philadelphia College of Osteopathic
Medicine said they have no quotas.

Spokesmen for Temple Univer-
sity’s medical school and the
University of Pennsylvania's medi-
cal school also said neither
institution hasquotas.

DiPalma stressed that the

 students are not given any breaks



on their academic qualiﬁcations.
They still must meet the approval of
the admissions committee, made up
of faculty and not controlled by the
dean.

When the Wilkes program was
started four years ago, Hahnemann
at the same time decided to increase
its enrollment to 250.

But DiPalma said the accredition
committee, composed of the
Association of American Medical
Colleges and the American Medical
Association, would not let class size
rise about 180.

With that number of students,

Student Alcohol Abuse

Studied by Task Force

(C0nrinuea’from Page 1)
students not to drink, but instead
aretrying to show them to how to
drink responsibly. We want to show
the students how to enjoy alcohol
without harming themselves and
others both mentally and physical-
ly, and how to make good decisions
while using alcohol,” Snyder said.

According to the most recent
national statistics, -alcohol abuse

- has increased by 40 percent since
1971.

Snyder believes that, in keeping
with national norms, alcohol abuse
on the Pitt campus also has
increased. However, he said he
cannot accurately estimate the
range of the problem.

“One thing that must be’

considered when dealing with this
problem is that the people involved
are legal adults, and must be
treated accordingly. We are speak-
ing of something that is in violation
of the law, and we must respect the
students’ rights,” Snyder said.

Charles Westbrook, community
relations director for the campus
Police and also a task force member,
said members represent a cross-
section of the University commu-
nity.

“There are men, women, stu-
dents, faculty and staff on the task
force,” Westbrook said. This group

~ should be able to effectively view all
sides of the problem.

According to Westbrook, Pitts-
burgh City police made 184 arrests
for drunkenness last year; 50
percent of those arrested were
students. Westbrook also said the
majority of students were betweei
the ages of 18 and 25.

 

Open six days
a week (Thurs.
& Fri. ‘til 9 p.m.)
NO APPOINTMENT
, NECESSARY

At Pitt, between January and
October 1977, Campus Police made
49 arrests for drunkenness. “Many
times a campus policeman will be
forced to use his own discretion
when involved in an arrest for
drunkenness,” Westbrook said. ‘.‘If
the person is able, the ofﬁcer may
escort him back to his residence, or
he may allow him to go home under
his own power. Also, the ofﬁcer ma y

just take him somewhere to sober
up, then send him home. There is no
set procedure. It is left entirely up to
the arresting ofﬁcer. ‘

“There has been a definite
increase in the amount of drinking
on the Pitt campus,” Westbrook
continued, “but, with the ﬁndings
of this task force and the pending
survey, I hope steps can be taken to
increase the studentsawareness of
alcohol and its long term effects.”

Sally Kinger-Belotti, the WPIC
representative, said the drinking
problem among college students
has, for the most part, been “blown
out of proportion." I g

“The media says there is a
problem,” Kinger-Belotti said,
“but it could be that drinking has
become more open and accessible
than it was back in the 1960's, when

«drinking regulations _were en-

forced.”

Belotti also blamed the advertis-
ing industry, for the current trend
toward alcohol abuse. It promises,
Belotti said, that consumers will
become attractive, sexy and "cool if
they indulge in their particular
brand of alcoholic beverage.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

waiting on the House

Pitt students with a pechant for looking on the bright side can go
home this weekend thankful there probably will be a Pitt to come
back to on Monday. Those of us endowed with a lesser measure of
optimism will be drowning our sorrows in cranberry juice cocktails
and wondering how long it can last.

Monday’s state House rejection of a tax bill earlier passed by the
Senate is the latest in a series of slaps in the face delivered by the
legislators to Pitt, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln students.
While the disparity between yes and no votes should narrow when
all of the representatives cast their ballots, no one here 1S holding
his breath in anticipation of a dramatic reversal of Monday’s tally.

Looking to Harrisburg, we begin to wonder if the legislators are

ever going to set aside par_ochial and personal interests long enough
to pass university appropriations. House minority leader Robert

Butera is a case in point.

His firm and uncompromising stand

against a tax increase will look good in his bid for next year’s

Republican gubernatorial nomination;

how far he is willing to

jeopardize that nomination in order to aid the universities appears

problematic at this point;

Perhaps Student Government Board president Bernie Payne is
right—the Senators got the message at last week s rally. but the
House members didn’t. Perhaps it will take several more busloads
of students on the Capitol steps to ensure that the state-related
universities find legislative relief. In any event, as Dave Tive seems
to suggest in his column on this page, Pitt students should let their
legislators know we’re mad as hell and we’re not going to take it

any more.

Armchair Analysis

An exhaustive cost-benefit analysis has been made. University
officials, students and sane members of the local community have
been consulted. Long— and short-term potential benefits have

been ,duly considered.

Socio-cultural factors affecting future
’ enrollment patterns have been studied.

As a result, The Pitt News has determined it would be in the best

interests of the University for Jackie Sherrill’s Panthers to beat the

daylights out of Penn State Saturday afternoon at the Stadium.

By R. DAVID TIVE

It’s time to get angry.

I mean get really angry. We’ve
been pushed around. abused, lied
to and taken for fools long enough.
It’s time to show we_ have some
backbone, and aren’t going to put
up with this kind of garbage any
more.

What I’m talking about is, of
course, the absolutely ‘disgusting
performance of the state Legisla-
ture. Here it is, the end of

‘November, three months into the

school year and ﬁve months into
the ﬁscal year, and we still have no
budget from the state. Temple is on
the verge of a payless payday. A
plan to close for the week between

New Years and the start of school is
being discussed at Pitt. The crunch
is coming. The revolting part of it
all is that we now are no. closer to
an end to the crisis than we were
three months ago.

This was conﬁrmed by the

’ absolutely stomach-churning inter-

view with House minority leader
Robert Butera in Monday’s Pitt
News. His comments sounded like
they were taken straight from an
article he wrote for The Pitt News
last September. After three months
of supposed sincere effort to solve
the state's, and our, budget
problems, Butera is still in the
same place he was at the start. One
has to wonder if he has been
making any effort at all since

Letters To The Editor

Whether to Laugh or Throw Bricks

In reference to an article about
Eltor. John and Olivia Newton-John
by Patty Tascarella in the Nov. 16
issue of The Pitt News: You say
Elton John’s Volume II is superior
because there is more variety, but
does variety automatically imply
superiority in all cases? l’ll admit
Volume II is good, but so is Volume
1.

Why wouldn't you identify
“Lucy in the Sky” and “Pinball
Wizard” with Elton John? There
are remakes done all the time that
most young people would associate
with the new artist. In fact, a lot of
those people probably don”t even
know that the songs are remakes.
Also Elton John himself sang
in the movie
“Tommy.”

You mentioned that “Sorry
Seems To Be The Hardest Word”
wasn’t a high point. This song is

September, or if he just has been
feeding us a line.

Butera has said it is time for
everyone to be honest about what is
happening. Okay, Mr. Butera, let’s
be honest. Let’s be honest about
the fact that you are running for
governor next year, and are letting
your personal ambitions get in the
wav of aid to higher education.
Let’s be honest about the fact that
although you say a tax increase
isn’t necessary, that the $300
million can be found through
budget cuts, you have yet to
propose where those cuts be made.
And let’s be honest about the fact
that your impact, and the impact of
the whole Republican caucus in the
Legislature, has‘ been totally
negative—not one positive step
toward resolving this disaster has
come from you or your people.
Let’s be honest about those things,
Mr. Butera—if we are, we quickly
will see through the lies and
pablum you've been feeding us for

months' We have been shafted.

We have been trod upon. And we’

have been lied to. As long as we’re
being honest, let me be honest. I
have too much pride. in myself, and
too much feeling for this social
institution we call higher educa-
tion, to take that kind of crap
anymore. , ’

A change of tactics is indicated.
Up to this point, the ofﬁcials of the
universities caughtgin the budget
wringer have taken a moderate

collffset. of "acf.59D3' JCS‘ 3353‘. “9 Lﬁtheim ifuit-ion my have to"g0 up‘-irrxg. r. =.~ 2.» +:-.-+‘- it av .~<.-ix‘-;-; i .

very similar to “Someone Saved
My Life Tonight,” which you did
not list as being “not a high
point.” Finally, your “small gripe”
about chronological order is indeed
“small.”

As for your incisive remark about
Olivia Newton-John, I don’t know
whether to laugh or throw bricks.
What do you mean by “doesn’t
have enough hits to fill both sides
of a 45?” You should know that she
has at least six other Top 40 hits
besidesthe three you mentioned.
Likewise, your opinion that “out-
side of those three songs there’s
really nothing in the album” is
really unfair! That can be true of
any album if you don’t particularly
like the artist. Why come down on
Olivia Newton-John? Furthermore,
the fact that someone puts out a
greatest hits album does not signify
that it’s been a long time since his

understand their reasoning. They
-were afraid an all-out frontal attack
on the Legislature would make us
enemies rather than friends. They
may well have been right. But I’m
afraid they have stuck to the
moderate course for too long.

It is time for education’s
spokesmen to adopt a much
tougher ofﬁcial and public stance.
Such a stance will do much to
convince people outside of educa-
tion that we are facing a real crisis.
Such a stance will do much to

convince many within education,‘

such as the 35,000 or so Pitt
students who didn’t rally in
Harrisburg last week, that we are
facing a real crisis. Such a stance
will do much to convince the
legislators they can no longer
expect us to accept the lies they’ve
been giving us. ‘
Nobody has really gotten exer-
cised about the crisis to this point,
because it was always expected

that we would eventually get our

money. However, the situation has
changed in a subtle way. Unless
the money comes quickly, almost
immediately. the universities may
suffer some permanent damage-
damagethat cannot be repaired
even if the money does arrive.
Faculty and staff may choose to

leave because of the threat, or the
reality, of payless paydays. Crucial
services may have to be cut back
because there simply isn’t enough
money on hand right now to fund

last release. If so, how do you
explain Olivia’s recent album

“Making a Good Thing Better?” It A

hasn’t been such a long time. And
what about “lovesick adolescent
boys?” Where do you get off
making such blatant insults as
that? Such sickening garbage
shouldn’t be allowed in any
newspaper.

If you don’t want to listen to that
type of music, I personally don’t
care, but to publicly berate that
person for no good reason is really
sick. To be fair though, I would like
to give you the beneﬁt of the doubt.

Grow Your Own Avocados, He

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Ever since plants caught on in
popularity, their prices have
skyrocketed. You still can buy three
scraggly vines from Woolworth’s
for a dollar on sale, but their quality
is not the best. A good way to bet the
price hike is-to grow your own.

Most popular if the recycled
garbage plants is the avocado.
Instead of plunking the pit into your
hefty trash liner, let it dry out for a

l

day, then peel off the brown skin.
Place three toothpicks about half an
inch up from the seed’s broadside,
and place it in a glass of water. Keep
this out of direct sunlight; within
three weeks, you should see some
root growth. You can also try this
procedure, then plant the pit
directly into a pot of soil.

Another way of producing plants
cheaply is to purchase a plant that
grows offshoots that can be
replanted. Spider plants, piggy

back and strawberry begonias all
have little plantlets growing from
stalks or stems. Do not immediately
detach" the small plant from its
mother; place it in a separate pot
and anchor it with bobby pins. Keep
it well watered, and cut the cord
when a slight tug at it does not
disrupt the roots. These plants also
can be grown in water, but the risk
of drowning is high.

You can create a hanging plant
from a pineapple top. Twist——don’t
slice—the top from a pineapple that
has a lot of fresh green growth at the
center of the spiny fronds. Let it dry
out for a day, then plant it in a
container of soil or place it in a jug of
water. Use the latter method if you
want a hanging plant; if grown in

soil, the plant cannot adjust to being
watered through the top. String
some supportive wire through it—it
doesn’t need a oontainer—and you
have a hanging plant. If you want
your pineapple to reproduce, plant
it in soil.

Another way to save money is to
get small cuttings from plants you
already have or can obtain from a
generous friend. Coleus cuttings
root easily in a clear glass of
water—they’re ready for planting in
ﬁve days. Various types of ivy do
better when rooted in soil. Make
sure you have at least two joints in
the ivy cutting if you intend to do
this.

Succulents, like jade plants, also
root easily and require a little

care-—but they take a long time to
grow. If you have patience, break
off single leaves from a jade plant
and let them dry out for a day. Then,
place them half way into a container
of soil.

If you want to resort to using
seeds, an herb garden takes little
time to start. Plant your seeds about
one-eighth of an inch deep, cover
them loosely with soil, keep them
damp, and cover the top of the
container with clear plastic wrap to
maintain humidity. Parsley makes

an attractive plant for a hanging ,

basket, chives take the longest to
sprout, and basil grows quickly and
sturdy. When these plants poke out
of the dirt, remove the plastic wrap.

‘Spirited ’ Fans Make Plans
ForAnnuaI Penn State Clash

By MARK CELENDER

With the Pitt-Penn State football
game only three days away,
everyone is aware of what the Pitt

football players are doing in
preparation for the game:
practicing.

But what about the other half of
the team, the Pitt fans? What are
they doing to get psyched for this
annual rivalry event?

“I’m trying to scrape up all the
tickets I can so I can get my friends
from back home into the game,”
said Jim Lacey, a sophomore at Pitt
and a resident of Fox Chapel.
“We’re getting a banner together

that’s going to say ‘Lions are pussy

cats’ and a cheer of ‘we hate
State." 

John Chiavacci, a sophomore and
a resident of Wilkes-Barre Pa.,
who’ll be watching the game at
home, said, “I told my mom to get
ready all the beer and sandwiches
she can.”

Brian Stepp, a senior and a
resident of Mt. Lebanon, is
planning to do a little mixing and
raising of the spirits for the game.

“I’m getting myself a bottle of
rum, and I’m going to have a real
good time at thegame," Stepp said.
“The only reason I’m getting rum
for the game is because they only
sell Coke at the Stadium, which, of
course, is a great mixer with rum.”

Although Pitt and ABC will
gather a nice sum of money from
the game, some entrepreneurial

Pitt students also are getting a piece
of the pie.

Residents of the second floor in
Tower B ordered and sold 1,000

rbs  .

buttons for 50 cents apiece. The -,.;

buttons expressed a profane

with PSU.

McCormick Hall residents have
sold over 300 t-shirts with “Screw
Penn State” printed on them, along
with a panther placing a screw-
driver into the belly of a PSU player.

The Pitt band is competing with
McCormick residents in the T-shirt
business. Their shirts, however,
use a less metaphorical» logo.

The band shirts state, “Penn

‘Beggarman, Thief’ -- Shaw’s Disappointing Sequel 

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pill News Staff Writer

Beggarman, Thief
By Irwin Shaw
Delacorte Press

Two years ago, ABC television
started the trend of novels for

Author lrwin Shaw’s new novel, “Beggarman Thief,” is a sequel to “Rich Man,

Poor Man.”

television by adopting Irwin Shaw’s

   

novel, “Rich Man, Poor Man," for
the small screen. “Rich Man, Poor
Man" grabbed a huge share of the
Nielson ratings, Nick Nolte became
a star and when the story had run
its course, ABC decided to retain
the vast audience by devising its
own sequel.

At the same time, author Shaw
was writing his own sequel to the
saga of the Jordache family, one
different from the televised version
—“Beggarman, Thief."

To understand the plot of
“Beggarman. Thief,” _vou have to

be familiar with the plot of
“Rich Man, Poor Man." The
original story dealt with the

competition between the Jordache
brothers—Rudy. the rich man of
the title. was a financial and
seemingly personal success. Tom,
his younger brother. was ne'er do
well who ﬁnally straightens out his
life. only to be killed at the book's
end.

“Beggarman. Thief" begins
where “Rich Man. Poor Man"
ended. Wesley, Tom's son, begins
to search for his father's roots. He
also is on the lookout for his

murderer.

The search provides Wesley
with encounters with the remainder
of his family—-—his rich uncle Rudy,
who tries to tear down the barriers
he has built about himself. his Aunt
Gretchen. who is embarking on a
career as a director and Gretchen's
son. Billy, in whom Wesley finds a
true friend.

Paralleling Wesley's search for
his father is the account of Billy's
career in the Navy. Beginning as
entries in a journal about his job.
the plot takes a sinister twist when
Billy discovers his live—in girl-
friend. Monika. is a terrorist who

entangles him in international
intrigue. After he realizes the
seriousness of the situation. he

stops keeping the diary, and his
part of the story is told in a
detached third person.

The problem with "Beggarman"

is that while Shaw claims to be
examining character, all this book
contains is some good dialogue, an
occasional piece of action but no
depth. Wesley, especially, is not
drawn ,out beyond cardboard
dimensions. Certainly. he is driven
by his need to know his father, but
Shaw mentions that he has a love
affair and a job in Gretchen‘s
newest film, and neither show a
new side of Wesley.

Since Billy talks for himself in his
journal, it is easier to see his mind
work. When Shaw reverts him to
the other style, he becomes as
stilted as Wesley. ’

“Beggarman, Thief" is a typical
sequel——disappointing and anti-
climactic. In this case, the
television sequel is totally unlike
the novel, so fans ofthe ABC series
will be disappointed.

 

Show Business In The Broadcasting Booth

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pill News Staff Writer

Somehow, in the last few years,
football games have become as
much a television tradition as
Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
With the added blitz of a five-day
football weekend, this seems like a
good time to evaluate the football
coverage of the three major
networks. .

In 1970, ABC introduced “Mon-
day Night Football.” It changed
the face of televised sport—not
only did the show tackle “The Lucy
Show” in the ratings, it also
introduced the idea of the
sportscaster as a star.

Prior to “Monday Night Foot-
ball,” announcers had been anony-
mous and monotonous people in
the background who did play by
play and interviewed jocks. But
when ABC teamed nasal—voiced
Howard Cosell, drawling “Dandy
Don” Meredith and (later) Frank
Gifford, the antics and quips of the
three became so publicized (and, in
Cosell’s case, controversial) they
became the main focus of the show.

The J. Geils Band will be in Pittsburgh today with Edgar Winter 3 white Trash.
The concert is at the Civic . Arena at 7:30 p.m.

?
’ V

     
 

Never mind that Cosell never
played the game and Meredith's
comments were sometimes mean—
ingless——the team clicked.

Gifford epitomizes the athlete-
turned-sportscaster. While he is
sometimes dull and colorless, he
adds balance to the team. He also
knows what he's talking about.
Meredith makes many avoidable
mistakes and tends to depend on
that Southern charm too much.
However, he has a fresh approach
and an original way of expressing
himself. Like Gifford, he is also a
former football star (with Dallas);
unlike former Giant Gifford,
Meredith was booed out of the
Cotton Bowl into an early retire-
ment. Consequently, old prejudices
(especially against former coach
Tom Landry) still show up.

Cosell is the man you love to
hate—there is no half way. One
problem with him is he's so pro-Joe
Namath it’s ridiculous. They may
be friends. but can’t Cosell focus
on Namath‘s career with the Rams
in 1977 instead of Superbowl III in
1969‘?

CBS has one of the most
extensive programs around, focus-
ing on its two main sportscasters—
Tom Brookshier and Pat Summer-
all. They either work together or
are paired with an athlete-turned-
broadcaster. Brookshier and Sum-
merall are competent, if bland, and
when they don’t play up the buddy
act (as they have ever since
“Monday Night Football” caught
on) they do a fine job.

Pre-game shows are handled by
Brent Musberger (with the most
monotone in television history) and
former Miss America, Phyllis
George. Goerge is a curious
addition, particularly if you recall
CBS pioneered having women
in the broadcasting booth ﬁve years
ago with Jane Chastain. Chastain.
generally recognized as a know-
ledgable football person. once
attempted play-by-play during an
NFL contest. Male viewer response
was so heated CBS yanked her
from the show shortly after
halftime. Enter George, who prior
to being hired, admits she knew
nothing about sports. Apparrently,

the audience isn’t threatened as
long as she just does interviews.
NBC usually relies on Curt
Gowdy, undoubtedly one of the
most tedious talkers on the tube.
Team him with Jim Simpson, who
specializes in banalities. and you
know why NBC is slipping in the
ratings. Gowdy and Simpson
should realize nobody cares about
the population in some rookie’s
hometown, what Bert Jones does in
his spare time or what player on the
Steelers is a second cousin twice
removed to a defensive coach for
the Chargers. In fact, the trivia
Gowdy and Simpson consider
inside information interests no one,
bores everyone and the only

curiousity it piques is why NBC
doesn’t unload these clowns.

As for the former football players
NBC and CBS import to juice up
the ratings, their presence usually
excites only their immediate family
members. John Brodie fares the
best, he’s understated and doesn’tL
act like a cheerleader. Len Dawson
also comes off rather well. But, for
the majority, they tend to rely on
their best bubblegum card pose
and try to sound intellectual. In the
long run, the networks would be far
better off merely running a blow up
of the bubblegum card in the booth
with the regular broadcasters——the
conversation would be improved.

  Pitt, PSU Ready for The Game 

\

ByJIMPANE
‘Pill News Staff Writer

when the announcement was
made Saturday that both Pitt and
Penn State were snubbed out of a
major bowl berth, Pitt coach Jackie
Sherrill remarked this weekend's
encounter between the two teams is
THE bowl game.

Sherrill wasn’t downplaying the
importance of each squad’s up-
coming post-season action, but
Saturday’s clash at Pitt Stadium is

much more meaningful to everyone

involved.

. Spotlighted before a nationwide
_audience (ABC television; 12:50

p.m. kickoff) (will be two national

’ powerhouses, vying for the Eastern

championship and a higher spot in
the rankings. Add to that the fact
that Pitt and Penn State are 84-year
rivals; it just may turn out to be THE
game of the year—anywhere.

“It’s going to feature two teams
from the same state, nationally
ranked, ﬁghting for the Eastern
championship,” Sherrill said at
yesterday’s weekly press lunch-

eon. "‘And Pitt-Penn State is a big

rivalry, the same as Oklahoma-Ne-

braska,~ Texas-Texas A&M ,and

Ohio State-Michigan. ’ ’

The only difference seems to be
that Pitt and Penn State have
enough combined nntential, to
provide more than your everyday
rivalry.

Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh said he fell asleep during last week’s telecast
of the Ohio State-Michigan game. He’ll have to stay wide awake and alert in
Saturday’s climax of the regular season lf the Panthers hope to knock off rival
Penn State at Pitt Stadium.

of the Ohio State-Michigan game
Saturday, and I fell asleep,” said
Panther quarterback Matt Cava-
naugh.

It’s doubtful Saturday’s collision
at Pitt Stadium will put anyone to
sleep. Aside from any grudges that
may have developed from the
Orange Bowl controversy to arouse
interest, both teams are evenly

matched. Only one spot away from
each other in the rankings (Penn
State is eight, while Pitt is number
nine in the UPI poll), both‘ units
offer talented performers in skilled
position—a factor that earmarks a
wide-open offensive display.

The teams are so evenly matched,
Steeler assistant coach Dan Rad-
acovich said they are the two finest

football teams in the country. Pa-
terno doesn’t quite agree.

“I wouldn’t say that,” the Lion
coach said. "But 1 will say that
whoever wins on Saturday has the
right to consider themselves better
than anyone else, depending on
what happens elsewhere.”

“We are very even,” Sherrill

  Paterno Hides Behind Verbal Smoke Screen

agreed. “The team that wins is the
one that will make the most out of
the advantages it gets throughout
the game.”

Sherrill also mentioned that it
wouldn’t take too much pre-game
pep talk to get either team up for the
contest, which, if won, would mean
much more than a notch in the win
column for Pitt’s second-year
coach.

‘ ‘Personal satisfaction is involved
here,” Sherrill said.

Matt Cavanaugh would “just as

soon beat Penn State as win the’

national championship.”

PANTHER NOTES: Elliot
Walker needs only 94 yards to reach
1,000 for the year—a mark that
would place him with Tony Dorsett
as the only Panthers ever to rush for
1,000 yards in a single season.

Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill and Penn State coach Joe
Eaterno,_each of whom played some role in the
Eastern football tragedy that left Pitt, Penn State
rand the Orange Bowl unsatisfied, yesterday offered

different versions of how it came about the Pitt-Penn
State winner will spend late December in either
Jacksonville or Tempe.
l “Offer,” however, is the wrong verb. Reporters
attempting to learn the coaches’ beliefs had to pry
leven to get decent evasions from Sherrill and Pater-
’ no, though evasions were somewhat revealing.
Paterno, who addressed Pittsburgh’s college foot-
ball writers before Sherrill by way of an amplified
telephone connection from State College, was
irritated by questions concerning the bowl bids and
} how they were determined. . V
“I don’t think there’s really any sense talking
’ about what has happened,” Paterno said. “I’m not
one for blaming people for things.”

Sherrill, who before each answer appeared to be
determining how far he should go in public, used
both silence and sentences to make known his disap-
pointment, displeasure and—after hearing Paterno’s
comments—tempered anger at how his team was
denied even a chance to play in a major bowl that had
‘ the Pitt-Penn State winner behind only Notre Dame

} on its preference list.
When asked whether he believed Paterno was
unaware of the reason Arkansas received a bid in-

 g Lg

stead of an Eastern team, Sherrill, after 15 seconds of
punishing silence, responded soberly:

“I think you know the answer to that without me
even saying it.”

Several Pittsburgh newspapers reported last week
Paterno had refused an Orange Bowl offer to have
Pitt and Penn State play for an invitation to Miami.

“The Orange Bowl wanted us,’
“That’s known.
ner.” .

Sherrill also publicly supported a published report
that the Pitt-Penn State winner was second only to
Notre Dame, an unavailable commodity, on the
Orange Bowl “wanted” list. .

f‘That’s not true,” Sherrill shot back at a reporter
who asked if the Orange Bowl had eliminated Pitt
long before Saturday’s deadline. “They wanted us.”

Why, then, is Pitt'in the Gator Bowl and Penn
State in the Fiesta Bowl?

But they wanted to take the win— ’

_Paterno through the irritation he exhibited because

“I don’t know enough to blame anybody,” said
Paterno. “And I don’t think it does anyone am;
good to talk about what’s happened.”

Penn State followers have blamed Pitt and
Pittsburgh’s writers for causing the Orange Bowl to
ignore Penn State. Paterno advanced an unsolicited
passing shot at reporters when he said, “We can’t
undo what has been done; not from our end of things
and not from the newspaper angle.”

Sherrill didn’t aim his sights at State College, let
alone Paterno, but was not peaceful in his assessment
of the situation. ,

“We were wanted,” he said. “Ever since mid-
season, that’s where we stood (behind Notre Dame
on the Orange list). But when it came time to push
the button a lot of people panicked. The Orange
Bowl people wouldhave waited. The bowls knew
who they wanted before the 19th, but it may be that
some events changed one of them.”

“What events?” was the next question. 

“You’ll have to ask Penn State about that,” he
answered, not hiding well the fact he believed he had
a story he wished he could have told without suf-
fering for a breach of diplomacy.

And so it was that each coach told his story:

the questions were asked, Sherrill through the
frustration he expressed at not being able to answer
them.

    

Pitt Triples Zips in Opener, 33-11   -

 

      
  
  
   

BYJIMLEWIS

Pitt News Staffwriter

Falls by Rande Stottlemyer,
George O’Korn and Bill Bailey
enabled the Pitt wrestling team to
crunch Akron, 33-11, in both
squads’ season opener at Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

The win set the Panthers (1-0) off

- on the right foot in their quest for an

impressive Eastern Wrestling
League showing.

“It was a good start,” Pitt head
coach Dave Adams said afterward.
“Our younger kids needed a match

, like this before the Penn State
Invitational. Everyone really

tried——tney made mistakes due to

lack of experience, but they really
tried.”

‘Injuries to starters Skip-

(167 pounds) and Mark Stepanovich
(heavyweight), and Glenn Max-
well’s 8-7 loss to Zip Mike Gercak,
caused speculation as to whether
the Panthers could overcome the
scrappy Zips. But Stottlemyer’s pin
of freshman Jeff Fischione with 24
seconds left in the second period,
following Jose Martinez’ (126) 9-6
decision over Mark Smith and Kim
Smith’s 11-11 draw against Craig
Wade broke a 5-5 tie and put Pitt
ahead for good. Stottlemyer-
competing in his ﬁrst match after a
year’s redshirt due to a shoulder
injury, seemed to come out of the
bout in good shape. ,

“I’m glad I’m back," he said. “I
felt good before the match and
Q10-ughtlid do all-rights I’ll- have to

wait until tomorrow to see if it
hurts.” ‘

From then on, Akron didn’t score
a single'point, as Ed Bredniak (150)
dominated Mike Joseph, 8-0,
freshman Tom Jones (158) smacked
Mike Bitting, 14-8, Jim Gordon
(167) bombed Dave Scavyzzo, 10-5,
O’Korn pinned Gino Caponi in a
quick 2:25, and Bailey (190) felled
Brad Bennett in 6:46. Frosh Mike
Palko was pinned by huge Eric
Porosky with only 29 seconds left in
the bout.

Adams was pleased with his
team’s overall performance.

“Our freshmen and new wrest-
lers learned a lot tonight,” .-he
claimed. “They found out where

they are condition-wise and twerex.

introduced into college wrestling.
“Overall, we were pretty aggres-

sive,” Adams said. “I’m pleased

with Rande’s (Stottlemyer) perfor-

-mance after.his long layoff—the

aggressiveness was there. O’Korn
has a tremendous amount of
ability—when he wants to turn it on,
he can go with the best. Our guys
should be exciting this season-—if

we stay away from injuries we’ll be
ﬁne.”

Freedom from injuries is a must if
the Panthers want to compete on the
same level with Lycoming and
Bloomsbuirg, upcoming opponents
in December, not to mention the
prestigious teams Pitt will face in
the Penn State lnvitational——the
wrestlers’ next obstacle.

A year ago this week, Dave
DiCiccio was busy cramming
himself with the things he needed
to know to play defensive end.
Pressed into emergency duty at
defensive right end after starter Ed
Wilamowski suffered a leg injury
two weeks ‘before last year’s
Pitt-Penn State game, the back up
monster back had some things to
learn before lining up against the
Nittany Lions.

“Everything was new to me,”
DiCiccio said after the game. “I
had never played the position
before in my life.”

Whatever fears DiCiccio might
have had going into last year’s
confrontation between the Pan-
thers and Penn State at Three
Rivers Stadium were unfounded.
The junior from Midland, Pa. did
an admirable job ﬁlling in for
Wilamowski as the Panthers
whipped the Nittany Lions, 24-7, to
help set the groundwork for their
eventual national championship.

Could the Edsel ever make another serious

In recent years, speculation in the city has

ball town, and few investors are willing to
wager several million dollars to the contrary.

Three-Pointl
Play

 

 

 By Bob Labriolﬁ

Cynics cite the infamous Condors as a prime ‘
example of the quickest and most efficient
path to bankrupcy. The fans stayed away in
droves, forcing management to count eyes
rather than heads in order to release some
sort of attendance figure.

Many people are unaware that a few years
before the Condors blew into town like a
tumbleweed, Pittsburgh was the home of the
ABA champion in the league’s inaugural

"‘}eason. In 1967, Connie Hawkins led a band

”"’ of assorted misfits and castoffs to the title,

giving Pittsburgh its first champion since the
1960 Pirates.

As the season progressed, the Pipers
gradually began to draw respectable crowds
to the Civic Arena, and by playoff time the
attendance approached capacity. At
season’s end, the Pipers’ owner received an
offer to move the team to Minnesota, where
economic prosperity was promised. Rather
than gamble on Pittsburgh’s demanding
fans, the team and the “Hawk” flew the

(‘H -.coop.
“’ When the team returned, Hawkins was in
the NBA and, despite being laden with

stalwarts of the hardwood such as Skeeter
Swift, Chico Vaughn and Helicopter Hentz,
the Condors never got off the ground. Not
only was the team at the bottom of the ABA
barrel, the opposing players who later signed
with the league and Could draw the fans
(Julius Erving, Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel and
Marvin Barnes) were still in college.
Basketball on the collegiate level
traditionally has been a hot and cold com-
modity in the city, with the quality of the
 competition, as well as that of the home
squad, as the determining factors. Pitt and
Duquesne each went through seasons when
they had teams worthy of national
recognition (Duquesne 1968 and 1970; Pitt
F197} —and- 1974), but by- refusing to plav

doubleheaders at the Arena, basketball
never reached the number of fans it could
have.

The dispute between the schools centered
on the issue of which university would play
in the feature game, and which would be in
the preliminary. This pettiness prohibited
basketball from becoming a widely accepted
sport in Pittsburgh, as doubleheaders would
have been an economical way for Joe Fan to
be exposed to bigtime college basketball. As
it was, fan interest was confined" to the
students and alumni of the two schools.
Citywide interest also could have been
promoted by more meetings between the two
schools, as something finally put into prac-
tice last year by the formation of the Eastern
Eight.

‘It will be interesting to see how the Eastern
Eight tournament draws at the Civic Arena,
but it is safe to say that if the attendance falls
short of expectations, Joe Fan again will be
publicly maligned. Pittsburgh fans, harden-
ed by years of mediocre teams in all sports,
are slow to spend their hard-earned dollars
for a ticket unless they are reasonably
assured of civtory or high quality entertain-
ment.

The Dapper Dan Roundball Classic is a
prime example of the type of quality sought.
Although the Pennsylvania team has
defeated the United States All-Stars only two
times, the event alway is sold out weeks in
advance.

Losers are not accepted with open arms in
Pittsburgh; the Amazin’ Mets never would
have been coddled here as they were in New
York in their early years. If the Rooney
family had not been able to support their
floundering football team with revenue from
horse racing, pro football also would have
been labeled a bad business venture.

It is foolish to contend that professional
basketball would be an instant success in Pit-
tsburgh. Until the team established itself as
a winner, the owners would operate in the
red. If the team began to improve, so would
the fan support. Neither the fans nor the
city deserve the blame for the Condors extin-
ction; the ineptitude of the players and
management deserve credit for the untimely
end.

When Chuck Noll first took over as coach
of the Steelers, he was asked whether Pit-
tsburgh could ever support a winning foot-
ball team.

“Losing has nothing to do with
geography,” Noll replied. “Our job is to
play quality football, and, if we do that, the
fans will come out to see it.”

defensive end, is going about his

Wednesday, "November 23, 1977-1111-: prrr NEWS——Page 11

“I was deﬁnitely more excited
last year,” DiCiccio said, “but I’m
just as prepared this year. I guess
you could say I was more nervous.
After playing them last year, I
think I have an idea of the offensive
sets they'll be using this year. I’ll
have a better idea of what to expect
from them.”

Although DiCiccio says the
Fiesta Bowl-bound Nittany Lions
have improved over last seaon, he
expects them to stick with the same
offensive game play.

“I haven’t really seen that much
ﬁlm on them,” DiCiccio said. “But
from what I have seen, they look
much the same offensively as they

‘did last year. (Chuck) Fusina’s still

the quarterback.

“He seems to be going with the
same stuff he threw against us last
season. He likes the quick passes to
the tight end and the short passes

to his backs coming out of the '

backﬁeld. Their running backs
aren’t very fast.

“If they have changed, it’s that
Jimmy Cefalo is having a better
year,” DiCiccio said in reference to
the Nittany Lions’ all-America
candidate at ﬂanker. “He’s playing
like he did as a freshman.

“They seem to be coming off the
ball better than they did last year,
too.”

If there is a secret to stopping the
Penn State attack, DiCiccio thinks
it could be shutting down the
Nittany Lion running game and
getting a good rush on Fusina.

“I think we can do a good job
with their run,” DiCiccio said. “If
we can shut it down, we’ll be doing

all right. We also have to really
jump on Fusina. We have to have
the good rush on him.

“He’ll complete his share of
passes. He’s completing about 60
percent right now, and most of
those are coming on screen passes
and short passes over the middle.

“He also likes that short screen
pass to the back coming out of the
backﬁeld,” DiCiccio continued.
“In fact, that's how they scored
their only touchdown on us last
year. They threw the quick screen
to their back and he ran it right in.”

DiCiccio noted Fusina also likes
to throw the pass over the middle to
his tight end, Mickey Shuler,
another of the all-East candidates
Penn State has this season.

If Fusina goes to Shuler as much
as DiCiccio thinks he will, it could
mean extra duty for the 6-0,
205-pound former all-state quarter-
back from Midland High School.
DiCiccio, on the most defensive
formations, will be responsible for
covering the Nittany Lions’ tall
tight end.

“On some plays, I’ll be lined up
against Shuler and on others I’ll be
stacked like a linebacker,’ ’ DiCiccio
explained. But I’ll probably be on
the tight end more than anything.
I've watched ﬁlms of Shuler, and
Fusina likes to go to him on the
crossing route over the middle.
Shuler’s improved a lot since I saw
him last year. But he's not as
strong as Ken McAfee is for Notre
Dame.”

to Rebound

Both On and Off the court»

By 303 LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The ability of the Pitt basketball
team to rebound will be the key
factor in determining whether the
1977-78 season is successful.

The Panthers are looking to
rebound from a disappointing 6-21
record, as well as improving their
play under the boards, their glaring
weakness last year. With last
season’s leading rebounder, Mike
Rice, ineligible at least until
January due to academic difﬁ-
culties, Pitt will turn to Ed
Scheurmann, freshman Sam
Clancy and Gary Smith, a 6-8
transfer from Allegheny Commun-
ity College to bear. the brunt of the
rebounding responsibilities.

Scheuermann, who stands 6-11,
has added 20 pounds to raise his
weight to 210, and will most likely
operate out of the center position.
Clancy, the high school all-Ameri-
can forward from Brashear, will see
action at both center and forward,
and may provide an immediate
answer to many of the rebounding
questions, as will the return of
Terry Knight (redshirted last
season) and the maturation of
Sonny Lewis.

Tim Grgurich, with nine return-
ing lettermen, entered the recruit-

_ing battle last year looking to

improve on the team rebounding
and in search of a point guard
capable of running the fast break.
Dave Olinger, a 6-5 freshman from
Fresno, Ohio and Terry‘Peavy, the
6-4 transfer from Allegheny Com-
munity College who posted 8.8
assists per game last season, will
be given an opportunity to show
what they can do. Pete Strickland
and Bob’ Haygood will have
experience working in their corner
as Grgurich has_ adopted a
wait-and-see policy as to what the
starting lineup will be for each
game.

“We will not have a set starting
lineup this year,” Grgurich ex-

-plained. “There is a good chance

that it will change from game to

players that we have conﬁdence in.
We’ll probably go with what we
need for each particular game.”

Pitt will have a schedule more to
its liking this year, as the Panthers
will have 15 home games in 1977-78
as opposed to only nine last year.

“The best thing about our
schedule this year is that we won't
be on the road so much,” Grgurich
said. “Being on the road 17 times
like we were last year is not
conductive to anything. We've got
to establish some sort of winning
attitude to turn it around and the
best way to do that is to play in
front of our own people.”

Looking ahead to the Eastern
Eight Conference, Grgurich sees it
as a wide-open year with several
teams ultimately being the teams
to beat.

“Every team in our division will
be tough this year because of the
natural rivalries,” Grgurich said.
“Pitt, Duquesne and West Virginia
can all beat one another on any
given night, so it’s really hard to
choose a favorite before the season.

“As a conference, it should take
about five years, before the
Eastern Eight can be compared to
the other more established con-
ferences. The most important thing
is for the representative we send to

the NCAA tournament to win a few .'

games, which will earn us some
respect.”

Pitt opens the season playing
host to Morris Harvey, November
26, at the Field House at 8 p.m.
Little is known about the Panthers
ﬁrst opponent because virtually no

scouting takes place prior to the‘

season opener. Grgurich will be
more concerned about Pitt's
performance, knowing that if the
Panthers play up to their potential,
the victories will come.

“We've been reminded about
last season everywhere we’ve
gone,” Grgurich said, “and we
knew what caused it and we’ve
worked on those areas in the
pre-season. “We know we have a
good basketball team; now we have
to go out on the court and prove
