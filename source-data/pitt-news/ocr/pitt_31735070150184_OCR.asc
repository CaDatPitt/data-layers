THE PITT NE

The Daily Student Newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh

Group
explores
the finer

things

Pat McAteer
Senior Suﬁ Writer

When senior Dan Veres co-
founded Pitt’s Finer Things
Club last semester, he didn’t
want the group’s mission con-
ﬁned to a simple description
on the Pitt Student Organiza-
tion Resource Center website.

“We don’t like to limit ﬁner
things to one or two [things],”
Veres said.

So with the help of fellow
seniors Jay Crammond and
Kyle Ryan and inspiration from
hit NBC sitcom “The Office,”
Veres wrote the organization’s
constitution at the end of last
semester. And the trio say Pitt
students have bought into the
idea of living a cost—friendly
cultured life.

Finer Things Clubs have
popped up across the country
since characters on NBC’s “The
Office” participated in a Finer
Things Club in a 2007 episode.
On the show,‘ the three char-
acters who compose the Finer
Things Club discuss litera-
ture, music and the arts during
lunch breaks from work.

Pitt’s version of the Finer
Things Club is far more in-
clusive, and the club’s cre-
ators said theywill center the
group’s definition of “finer
things” on the aspects of life
that club members consider
“ﬁne.”

. Completion of Hillman Library patio repairs is near

Pat McAteer
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

After years of waiting, the com-
pletion of repairs to the patio
around Hillman Library is ﬁnally
scheduled for this spring.

For Pitt administrators, re-
placing the 40-year-old patio has
proven a major headache.

According to an article pub-
lished by The Pitt News in April
2010, University administrators
expected that construction teams
would repair the “waterprooﬁng
membrane -surface,” located un-
der the stone patio, by the sum-
mer of 2010.

But Pitt spokesman John Fe-
dele said in an email on Thursday
that this initial project developed

leaks, forcing a redevelopment
of construction plans that moved
its completion date back to this
spring, add'rng that “the solution

has been complex from an,engi-

neering and legal perspective.”
“Though the ﬁrst efforts to

stop the leaks’ were unsuccess-

ful, this summer, the University
completed negotiations with the
architect and contractors on an
agreement to ﬁnish the project
by spring,” Fedele said. '
While fortunes appear to be in
the favor of Pitt administrators
and the Massaro Corporation,
the contractor employed for the
patio construction project, pa-
trons and employees of the Hill-
man Library have endured some
of the project’s bothersome side

effects. A
Robert Hallead, an employee
in the ’library’s Interlibrary Loan

Department, said the construc- ‘
V tion forced library administra-

tors to turn olf central air con-
ditioning on the building’s rﬁrst
ﬂoor, causing temperatures in
the closed-in department to
reach 88 degrees‘ at times.

He added that other library
employees on the ground ﬂoor
have commented on the heat
caused by the lack of air condi-
tioning.

‘But recently, according to
Hallead, noise from the patio’s
construction has caused addi-
tional problems for Interlibrary
Loan Department patrons and
employees. V A

“Now, they’re jackhammer-
ing above us, so, you know, that

constant jackhammering can be

a little bit of a nuisance,” Hallead
said.

Students who use the library
as a study area have similar griev-
ances with the patio construction
project’s recently amped—up ef-
forts.

Senior William Bird, who

often studies at the Hillman Li-

brary, said the construction is
bothersome.

“Every time, I have to go
around to the front of Hillman to
walk into Hillman, when I used to
just be able to walk up the back
patio, which was a lot easier,”
Bird said. “So it’s kind of annoy-
ing for me.” I

' Ryan, the club’s business manager,
said he couldn’t deﬁne what “ﬁner
things” were, and instead broadly de-
ﬁned the phrase as “a wide collection
of what life is about, and what people
enjoy in their own lives.”

Veres, who plays the cello and enjoys
classical music, said he envisioned the
group attending concerts at the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra, because he
wanted to expand the group to younger
music lovers, as well as meeting with
local artists.

But he added that he wanted mem-
bers to keep a relaxed atmosphere at
club meetings, allowing members’ in-
terests to dictate the group’s agenda.

“We really try to keep the meetings
light and enjoyable,” Veres said. “We’re
not there to have a stressed discussion.”

Crammond, the club’s vice presi-
dent, said the group has attracted “a
pretty wide range of people” among the

50 students who RSVP—ed for the club’s
first meeting. Unfortunately, he said,
the meeting never materialized because
of scheduling difficulties.

Despite the eclectic nature of the

Crammond and Veres agreed that
appreciation of nature was a part of
life’s “ﬁner things,” and Veres said he
hoped to hold some meetings outdoors.

museums and stuff like that ish’t just
for older, cultured people, but for

Crammond said that he believes nature
helps to “enhance” the ﬁner things in
life.

Ryan, an actor and standup come-
dian who’s appearing in the upcoming

film adaptation of “The Perks of Being a
Wallﬂower,” said the Finer Things Club
is a testament to the interests and ac-
tivities of his group of friends at Pitt,
which includes Crammond and Veres.
He said they wanted to ﬁnd fellow stu-
dents who enjoy activities such as at-
tending art shows and symphonies.

“We want to get more people in-
volved and see if there are other people
interested in this,” Ryan said. “We just
had this sudden urge, and then we had
160 people sign up at the activities fair.”

As the group’s student following con-
tinues to grow in just its ﬁrst semester,
Veres said he hopes the Finer Things
Club improves the cultural savvy of not
only its members, but the Pitt student
body as a whole.

“I want to get the word out there that
classical music, art, going to museums
and stuff like that isn’t just for older,
cultured people, but for everyone,”
Veres said.

Pennsylvania voter ID law undermines
the structure of democracy

Rohith Palli _
F or The Pitt News

Pennsylvania’s‘ new voter ID
law, with its supposed effect on
the upcoming presidential elec-
tion, has been a high-proﬁle
news item recently. Pennsylva-
nia House Majority Leader Mike
Turzai, R-Allegheny, proudly
said it “is going to allow_Gover—

nor Romney to win the. state of ;

Pennsylvania.” Democrats have
denounced these measures as
attempts at voter suppression.

It is clear that . disenfran-
chisement is, in fact, the aim of
this law. According to News21,
a Carnegie-Knight investigative
reporting project, there have
been only 10 reported cases
of in-person voter fraud since
2000.

Legal arguments over the
state’s new voter‘ID law resumed"

on Thursday in Pennsylvania’s
CommonwealthCourt, with the
American Civil Liberties Union
and other groups challenging
the law and trying to prevent it
from being implemented for the
upcoming presidential election.

The most repulsive aspect
of all of this is the undermin-

- ing of individuals’ rightto have-r ’

a sayein government; American
citizens have the right to vote
regardless of who they are. The
right does not require that they
pay for afstate ID, nor that they
can take off work to obtain such
an ID while the DMV is open.

_ They simply have the right to ’
vote. Attempts to curtail that
right fundamentally clash with 2
our system of representative

democracy.

Putting these ethical claims

aside, will this law have the
drastic effect on the election
that Turzai predicted?
1 Though polls say President
Barack Obama is leading Re-
publican presidential nominee
fMi’tt Romney with an estimated
49 percent and 42 percent of the
vote, respectively, this leaves
a crucial 9 percent undecided.
Furthermore, early September
polls have not historically had
that much predictive power in

presidential elections.

So, to examine the worst-
case—scenario effect of these
laws, let’sv examine the closest
presidential election in Penn-
sylvania in the past 20 years:
George W. Bush versus John
Kerry. In this election, 5,731,942
Pennsylvanians voted, and Ker-

ry won the state by 
votes. This is approximately 2.5 0

percent of the electorate.

So what percent of the elec-
torate will be prevented‘ from
voting by this new law? To have
a realistic number, we will use
ABC News’ claim of 1.3 million
Pennsylvanians. This is a mod-
erate estimate, since Gov. Tom
Corbett estimates the percent
of citizens without ID to be 1
percent, and the Philadelphia
Inquirer reports up to 18 per-
cent of citizens in Philly don’t
have ID. This discussion,’ how-_
ever, misses the point: not all

citizens without necessary ID’

would have voted in the ﬁrst
place. Making the assumption
that these people vote in the
same proportions as other peo-
ple, we can say that 10.2 per-
cent of the electorate would no
longer be casting a vote.

The next question is which
10.2 percent of the electorate?
According to the Brennan Cen-
ter for Justice, demographics
such as minorities, the poor
and the ‘elderly are groups who
compose most of the nation’s 11
percent of citizens without pho-
to“ IDs. Spotlightonpovertyorg
tells us that low income people
voted 56-41 for Democrats in
the 2010 midterm elections.

Assuming this remains» the .

same, Obama would gain a 15
percent edge from the voters
being disenfranchised by new
laws, but these voters only
constitute approximately 10.2
percent of the voter base. That
gives a total of 87,713 votes
cut from a theoretical Obama
lead —— much less than Kerry’s
razor-thinmargin of victory in
2004.

The possibility remains that
this massive disenfranchise-
ment will affect other elections;

this is, sadly, especially pos-
sible for local elections for the
very politicians that enacted
such backward measures. What
is forgotten in the Republican
quest for the White House is
that American citizens, regard-
less of race, gender, socioeco-
nomic status or tendency to

—; vote for the opposing party,

have the right to vote.

' With the total lack of re-
ported voter fraud, it is certain
that these laws will affect the
election and disrupt democ-
racy in a much more meaning-
ful way than voter fraud likely
ever would in the United States.
This is a clear case of politicians
meddling for the gain of their
party at the expense of the elec-
torate. : ' Z

The fact that the house lead-
er was willing to make blatatitly
corrupt and factually deﬁcient
claims sheds light on the poor
state of American politics.
Through this year’s mudsling-
ing and abysmal news coverage,
it is difficult, though not impos-
sible, to remember a time when
respectful opponents debated
real issues. .

These new voter ID laws and
subsequent comments would
have been met with outrage in
a time when politicians might
disagree, but fundamentally
understood that the American
people had the right to direct
their actions. Instead, such
atrocious comments are accept-
ed as part of the political reality
of the present day. .

We, the citizens, must make
politicians ‘ understand that
democratic institutions still
mean something. This is the
real world, not a chess match
between Democrats and Re-
publicans, and.it’s time that our
political leaders started act-
ing like it. Though we see that
the ultimate result is unlikely
to change in Pennsylvania this
year, all the citizens denied a
vote by burdensome bureau-
cracy still deserve to have their
voices heard. I

Take creative classes to relax and enjoy college

Elizabeth Weisel

Columnist

It’s that time of year again: advising season.
The time when you sort through hundreds
of classes on a dim gray website trying to
ﬁll your schedule with the classes you need
and the classes you want without stressing
yourself out, having bad professors or tak-
ing a class on Fridays.

It’s overwhelming, to say the least.

School is stressful, no matter what ma-
jor you’re studying or what your classes are;
everyone needs to blow off some steam. So
this is my advising for you: When choosing
your classes this semester, slide in a cre-
ative class that will help you release anxiety
from the rest of your semester.

A creative class can be one of multiple
options. It could be a class in studio arts,
theater, writing, music, or even physical
education. These are all ﬁelds that rely on
some form of creative expression.

Pitt offers courses in all of these sub-
jects, including Basic Piano, History of
jazz, Fiction Writing, Costume Design, Ba-
sic Drawing and Dance Production. While
not known for classes in the arts, Pitt offers
a wide variety of artistic classes that seem
to go unheard of by people who aren’t in
those ﬁelds. _ _A 4_

, Now,g,If,1fr_1ji_sl,1_l:41V.1‘V_‘e'you’re saying to yourself

at this point: I’m not an artist, why should
I care?

Well, let me tell you something — you
don’t need to be an artist. The whole point
of art is‘ that it comes from a real person
and a real place that creates some kind of
real expression. Especially in an introduc-
tory course, the

creative side is to sign up for a class that’s

going to engage it.
Even if you’re already in a creative ﬁeld,
I would still suggest trying something ar-
tistic outside of your usual comfort zone.
Often when we’re extremely invested in
our art, particularly when we’re forced
to be through co-

class is not about
your skill level, but
instead about your
willingness to learn,
to work and to cre-
ate.

Most academic
courses don’t afford
their students a cre-
ative outlet, espe-
cially in ﬁelds such
as math, business
and the sciences.

your time analyzing someone else’s work
instead of creating your own.

Especially when piling up four or ﬁve
classes concentrated on intense work
completely focused on the left side of your
brain, you need to leave a little room for the
right side to come out and exercise. The
best way to force yourself to embrace your

already creative
mind to explore‘ other areas of expression
that you might not have considered before.
It might even provide inspiration for your
other coursework and allow you to revisit
your ﬁeld with a renewed creative energy.

Still not convinced? I can tell you from
experience — it’s awesome.

Last fall, I overloaded my schedule with
writing, literature and history courses.

Taking a class -

While these may seem like ﬁelds with a lot
of creative output, because they’re within
my ﬁelds of study, they easily became real-
ly stressful and overwhelming. So I decided

a to take Costume Design, a class in the the-

ater department that I could take without
being a theater major.

That class was my saving grace in the
most stressful semester of my college ca-
reer (until this one). Whenever I got anx-
ious or overwhelmed, I knew that twice
a week I could look forward to spending
75 minutes reading plays and learning to
sketch, paint and design. Iwasn’t very good
at ﬁrst, but just the act of focusing on some
kind of artistic expression relieved my
busy mind. Since then, I’ve taken a creative
course outside of my major every semester.

For some of you, it may seem like a
strange concept to take an artistic course
that may have nothing to do with your in-
tended ﬁeld or count toward your major.
And while it may not seem like a practical
thing to do for academic success, it will
help you expand your horizons and ex-
change anxious energy for creative energy.

So during thenext month, as you meet
with your advisors and start to schedule
your classes, consider taking a course in
the arts. You never know what kind of ar-
tistic genius you might unearthl

The Pitt football team will be on bye this
weekend following back-to—back impres-
sive victories, but fans craving University
athletics still have numerous options on
campus over the next few days.

Beginning on Friday, the Pitt men’s and
women’s soccer teams, the volleyball team
and even the softball team will each host
games this weekend at the Petersen Sports
Complex and the Fitzgerald Field House,
respectively.

Here’s a rundown of the sports—viewing
opportunities available to Pitt fans during
the football-less weekend:

Friday, Sept. 28

The weekend of Pitt athletics begins
with a pair of games on Friday evening at
7 p.m.

The women’s soccer team welcomes
in-state and conference rival Villanova to
Ambrose Urbanic Field in. the Petersen
Sports Complex.

After a solid start to the season, the
Panthers (5-7-1, 0-3-1 Big East) have strug-
gled in the challenging Big East, but this

ference win ofthe season.

“We look forward to being home,” Pitt
ﬁrst-year head coach Greg Miller said on
the University’s official website. “We’ll
continue to ﬁght and try to get some points
wherever we can get them.”

Meanwhile, the volleyball team hosts

The Panthers (10-6, 1-1 Big East) return
home for the ﬁrst time since Sept. 4, af-
ter splitting games against Seton Hall and
Rutgers last weekend to begin conference
play. Pitt will hope that a victory over the
Bearcats (3-11, 1-1 Big East) can extend its

winning streak at home to_four games.
Pitt head coach Toby Rens hailed senior

outside hitter Alexa Campbell’siperfor-

mance in his team’s ﬁve-set triumph over
Rutgers.

..“A1exa has been one of our most con-
sistent players all season,” Rens said. “She
ha brought her play to another level, and I
hafre been impressed with her play in every
aspect of the game.”

Saturday, Sept. 29

Following a pair of victories at the
Cleveland State Tournament last weekend,
the Pitt softball team will continue its fall-
ball schedule on Saturday, when the Pan-
thers host Cleveland State for a double-
header beginning at 2 p.m. at Vartabedian
Field in the Petersen Sports Complex.

Pitt defeated the Vikings 3-0 at Cleve-
land State’s own tournament last Saturday.

cer team (6-2-2, 0-1 Big East) will look to _ --

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Undefeated Rutgers maintains lead in standings, Pitt moves up

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Big East hit a low point this past
week when the league’s football teams
went 3-4 against mostly mediocre op-
position.

Rutgers recorded the only notable
win -- a 35-26 triumph over Arkan-
sas, who entered the season as a top-
loiteam favored to compete for an SEC
championship.

Although Arkansas is now 1-3, it’s
still an impressive win for the Scarlet

Knights as they continue to prove me

right by remaining at the top of my Big '

East power rankings.

With two — yes, two — Big East
schools now in the top 25 of national
rankings for the first time this season,
here is my ranking of the eight confer-
ence programs heading into week ﬁve
of the college football season:

1. Rutgers

‘ While the Rutgers defense has car-
ried the Scarlet Knights through most
of 2012 so far, the offense and quarter-

back Gary Nova surged Rutgers past Ar-
kansas.

Nova had a career day, passing for
397 yards on 25-of-35 passes for five
touchdowns.

The Scarlet Knights, now ranked No.
23 in the country, proved their worth
over a talented Arkansas team that has
fallen on hard times.

Rutgers showed some resiliency
in the win, as well. The Razorbacks
jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the first
quarter, only to be outscored 28-3 in
the second and third quarters.

2. Louisville

A 28-21 victory might have erased the
memories of an upset loss to Florida In-
ternational in 2011, but the Cardinals did
not look impressive in the win.

On the road at FIU, Louisville almost
came up short. The Panthers never trailed
the Cardinals by more than seven points
and even outgained their opponent in
yardage. ,

BREAKDOWN

nally looked human, throwing two inter-
ceptions. However, he made up for it by
adding three touchdowns, two passing
and one rushing.

The Cardinals will need to play better
at Southern Mississippi this Saturday.

3. Cincinnati

The Bearcats took the week off, and
that was probably a good thing with most
conference teams struggling in week four.

Virginia Tech, who will still be annoyed
after losing to Pitt, looms this week on the
schedule for Cincinnati.

The Bearcats’ rushing attack leads all
Big East teams and is ranked 12th in the
nation, with an average of 259 yards per
game.

Since Pitt used a dominant rushing at-
tack to beat the Hokies, look for Cincin-
nati head coach Butch Jones to call plenty
of runs this weekend.

4. Pittsburgh

The Panthers did what they were sup-
posed to do against their FCS opponent
last weekend, beating Gardner—Webb, 55-
10.

Not much was learned about Coach
Paul Chryst’s team, even if Pitt did put up
626 yards offensively. '

In the dominant win, Pitt had a major
setback, as nine penalties for a total of 77
yards.raisedguestions about the team’s
discipline. " ' l ’  '

After how poor Pitt started the season,
the Panthers might be the toughest team
to judge in the Big East this year.

’5. South Florida

A late touchdown by Ball‘ State sunk the
Bulls, 31-27, last Saturday.

South Florida got the ball back with just
over a minute to play and drove down the
ﬁeld, but the drive stalled at the Ball State
28-yard line when USF quarterback B._].
Daniels threw an interception inside the
10-yard line on the ﬁnal play of the game.

Although the loss came at the hands of
an MAC school, Ball State has looked im-
pressive in 2012, with only one loss. The
Cardinals also clinched a win over Big Ten

school Indiana.

This weekend, the Bulls have a chance
to get the Big East’s biggest win of the
year when they take on in-state rival No.
4 Florida State, a legitimate national title
contender.

6. Connecticut
The Huskies’ fourth game looked very
- similar to South Florida’s.

Taking on a quality MAC school, West-
ern Michigan, on the road, UConn nar-
rowly fell, 30-24.

It was the second straight year that the
Huskies lost to the Broncos, as Connecti-
cut fell behind early, 17-0, and couldn’t

The Owls lost to Penn State for the 23rd
consecutive time last weekend.
But this loss especially stung for the

marked this year as the chance to knock
their rival.

However, Temple’s defense looked atro—
cious, allowing much—maligned Nittany
Lion quarterback Matt McGloin to throw
for 318 yards.

That said, Penn State played very poorly,
and Temple never really competed. The Nit-
tany Lions had nine penalties for 100 yards
and committed the game’s only turnover.

Maybe a bye week will help the Owls re-

group.

8. Syracuse

The Orange lost to an undefeated Big
Ten program on the road by just one touch-
down, but Syracuse still sits on the bottom
of the standings.

That’s because Syracuse has gotten the
beneﬁt of the doubt too much this season
for its several close losses, and losing to
Minnesota — even if it is 4-0 — doesn’t fall
in the category of a quality defeat.

Syracuse quarterback Ryan Nassib —
still second in the nation in passing yards
— struggled against Minnesota with two
interceptions.

The lone bright spot for Syracuse was
wide receiver Alec Lemon. His nine re-
ceptions for 106 yards moved him to ﬁrst
on the career reception record list at the
school. I

“We played well in spurts, but not a

ence,” Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher said
of the 3-1 defeat to Navy.

At the same time, the volleyball team
will host No. 17 Louisville (12-2, 1-1 Big

packed weekend schedule of Pitt sports
concludes with the Panthers hoping to up-
set the ranked Cardinals. I
