Owl Pix Taken
This Month

Sales campaign for the 1945
Owl opened last Monday with the
announcement that pictures would
be taken starting November 15.
Circulation manager Dodie Hur-
rell said yesterday “This year’s
Owl will have more and better
pictures, but those people who
want photographs in the book
must subscribe before November
29. Only purchasers of books will
be pictured.”

Prices for the Owl are: $5 for
seniors ($2 down payment), and
$3.00 for underclassmen ($1 down
payment).

Salesmen will be on campus to
assist students though Owls may
be bought at any time in the Owl
office. Students are urged to co-
operate in subscribing as early
as possible. This will simplify the
task of planning for the number
of books needed, and insure a
copy for everyone. ’

University Organist Captivates
Audiences With Renditions

At many graduation ceremonies
and Commons ‘Room receptions
Frederic Lotz, by virtue of the ex-
cellent quality of his playing, has
caused many a break in friendly
conversation and has turned the
attention or the audience to the
interpretation of his melodies on
the organ and piano. Modest, re-
tiring, our University organist did
most of his studying here in Pitts-
burgh. Under the guidance of
Vince Wheeler and Harry Archer,
both authorities on church. music,
he has spent years perfecting his
style and gaining a perfect under-
standing of spiritual selections.

It seems ironic that this gentle

_musician was forced, inthe serv-

ice of his country, to operate a
death-dealing machine gunduring
theﬁrst world war. But Mr. Lotz
said that when he was not at the

‘ front, he played the trumpet and

” ‘Cornet in the -army band. He was

later given the opportunity to
study his beloved music at Fon-

gtainebleau outside of Paris when
he obtained a three-month::’ leave

i

of absence.

, Mr. Lotz conducted an evening
school chorus here at the Univer-
sity for several years before he
was officially -engaged by" the Uni-
versity in 1942. Since that time
he has been performing an out-
standing service to the faculty and
student members. at gala Univer-
sity-sponsored affairs and at the
organ recitals which he presents
daily. “I like it very much,” he
says, “when the students come up
to talk with me after these pro-
grams and ask me to play their
favorites.” —

At present, this artist who
seems to have the usual accepted
characteristic ,of his profession, a
rather happy but faraway look in
his eyes, is accompanist for the
Mendelsso.hn choir, considered one
of the superior musical organiza-
tions in the city. He also plays
during Sunday service at St. An-
drews_ church at Center and
Morewood avenues, where many
of our faculty and student body
worship. ' ' 0

The committee asks the whole-
hearted coope-ration of every man
and woman.

Assistant chairman L 0 u i s e
Johnston said, “We know the.stu-
dents realize everything is costing
more in the Paciﬁc war than in
the European theater because of
the longer distances. The govern-
ment needs money, and a lot of
it. There shouldn’t be any ques-
tion concerning the support of
Pitt members in this drive.”

Members of the committee are:

Ed; and Jean Mueller, C. C-ommit-
tee members will wear identiﬁca-
tion badges during the four weeks
of the drive.

“The invasion, and the ﬁghting
in the Paciﬁc have meant that the
American people. must support
with added enthusiasm,” conclud-
ed the chairman. “And there isn’t
a better or safer investment in
the World today than war bonds.”

The drive is the ﬁrst project
of the War Finance committee on
the campus this year.

The Sixth War Loan drive, already in full swing across the
country, opens on Pitt campus next Monday. Already “eds”

and “coeds,” the patriotic gleam in their eyes rapidly dulling .

at the impending demand for more money, are protesting,
“Really, I’d like to buy more stamps and bonds, but, gee——-I
can’t aﬁordﬂitl”

Well, at’-ﬁrst it seems that we can’t aﬁord it. We all know
what a toll school supplies and fraternity dues make upon the
old money pouch. And ‘those linaccounted-for-things, like the
Owl subscription and honorary banquet fees come up much too
often for economy. Sure, we’ve contributedlto the United War.
Fund and ﬁlled out income tax returns——and on top of that
bought bonds out of our defense jobpay.

But when we think of Joe Morris from across the street who
went down on the Helena and our own brothers and sweethearts
who are still sweating it out on Leyte, any reason we can think
of for not buying bonds seems superﬁcial.

The truth of the matter is that we can ’t aﬁord NOT to buy
bonds for a great many reasons:

They are our means, as citizens, of helping to win the war.
They are our contribution to preventing inﬂation.

They are the safest investment in America today.

They bring a high interest return.

They mean future security for us and our families.

They insure us additional post-war purchasing power.
There can be no question in our minds as to the advisability
of investing ‘in bonds. There can be no doubt, if only for purely
selﬁsh reasons, that we can’t aﬂord NOT to buy war bonds.

posed to be a nation-wide cigarette shortage at the present time.
Joe Public is forever talking about it and newspaper writers are
having a picnic writing about it. However, a few casual glances
at stairways and ﬂoors here at Pitt seem to belie what is cur-
rently acceptted as a conc1u.~;ive fact.

In short, cigarette butts are sprouting from our ﬂoors like
little white weeds of neglect. \Ve feel that women, as well as
men students, are to blame, since slight tinges of red outline
many of the butts. The University has provided rooms for
smoking and ‘containers, ﬁlled with sand, for the butts. It seems
to us that it is just as easy to throw the little offenders into a
container as it is to throw them on the ﬂoor, so why not dispose
of them in the approved manner and be right? Remember, it
has been said that being right is preferable to being president.

Between-class smoking parties in the various nooks and
crannies of the Commons room seem to be gaining in popularity.
Needless to say, we will not dwell here on the dignity of the
Commons room, which was evident long before we came here
and will go on long after we leave. Still, it is our duty to take
a sense of pride in preserving it while we are here. Every
smoker, now and then, feels the need of a “quick one” between
classes, but wouldn’t it be just as enjoyable in a smoking room
as in the Commons room where it is not only against the rules
but offends others as well.

Obeying rules is merely a matter of respecting the rights of
others, as you, in turn, expect your own rights to be respected.
So let’s all try and realize this and put our smokes where they
belong. And by the way, where do you get all those cigarettes?

Y, Eero Davidson’s square-dance
group is in full swing. And I do
mean swing. Fifty—four pairs of
hands clap out the rhythm, the
fiddlers saw away as though their
lives depended on it, Eero bel-
lows the calls: “Swing your part-
ner twice around” — here eight
head couples whirl breathlessly
—- “and Allemand left!"

With a last fre-nzied crescendo,
the music stops. Exhausted, you
sink into the nearest chair and
look around you. Your partner
introduces you to a woman. in
ﬂats and peasant skirt who apol-
ogizes for -being a Margaret Mor-

the boy whom you saw play Mal-
volio last year at Tech. There are
some Pitt students, too, and a
crowd from Monty Mayo’s folk-
dancing group, as much at home
doing “Little Brown Jug” as they
are in the Russian “Korobushka.”
In the center of the ﬂoor, Mimi
Davidson has taken advantage of
the lull to lead an hysterical cir-
cle in the GI version of the
hootchy-kootchy. And now Eero
announces that a visitor from
Canada will call a dance Canadian

“Shooﬂy, don’t bother me,” call

“Four hands round . grand

Poll Reveals Men

Lee Mclnerney

Many students have approached ‘

me and asked that my column
this -week he devoted to a pet
wish of theirs. I'm gladly doing
so-but if they wish to get. action
on this, I’d suggest they form a
committee and then go to some-
one in authority. This. will only
serve to bring it to public atten-
tion. By no means will it accom-
plish anything else.

Some of the boys and girls at
Pitt-—and I do not say all or most
of them, for I don’t know if that's
the case—would like to have a
room for dancing in thecathedral.
They want a juke box, a few
chairs on the sidelines, and ample
space for twirling around in the
middle. They think the coeds and
fellows should have some other
place to mingle besides the Tuck
Shop.

I’m not aware if an idea such

as that has been .a -campaign of
students in the past; neither do I
know if there is a University rul-
ing concerning it. If either of
these two conditions has exist-

ed or exists now, the chances of -

getting a room for dancing are
probably slight. But that’s for
students interested in this par-

ticular project to dis-cover for I,

themselves.

Pitt, of course, Y
meant to educate. But a fact that
certainly has been recognized
here is that social life is also a
part of college. I don’t believe
anyone meant to complain about
the lack of such when this dance
business was suggested. Rather,
the suggestion was due to a feel-
ing that it might contribute bene-
ﬁcially to the social life as it now
is, the students thereby proﬁting
from it. '

Whether there might be a room
available for dancing is a ques-
tion.. Most of the army personnel
have left Pitt, yet it would be
wise to check on the space left.
The entire proposition is in the
hands of students who really want
to see the plan carried out suc-
cessfully. It might be an impos-
sibility, but there’s no harm try-

About Pitt Freshman Women

“What do you think of this

year’s class of Freshman girls?”
That was the question -on the in-
quiring reporters” lips as they
buttonholed and quizzed their
way among various and sundry
examples of “The Pitt man.” The
results of the little excursion in
“$6'4—do'llaring” are controversial,
confused, an-d, one might even
say, inconsequential. However,
they have polled boldly, and _now
will tell all soulfully.

The average freshman came up
with the ensuing immortal re-
mark, of a seemingly disinterested
spectator. “Th-ey’re nice, but what
chance has a freshman got with
all those smooth upper-classmen
holding priorities?”

A horn-rimmed. sophomore
“brain” was spied un-der a pile of
books engaging in the following
soliloquy: “Best bunch of girls
I’ve seen in all my college days. I
wonder what that redhead’s name
is in my biology class. Everytime
I try to read the name on her
armband she turns away.” With
that, he resumed his treatise on
the nebular hypothesis.

Many Tuck Shop troubadours
volunteered the opinion that “The
blonde over t-here,” or “That chick
in the red sweater” was all reet
with them. One sleepy-eyed in-
dividualist, however, ventured the
following acid comment, “Ah, I

ain't seen nuthin’ to write home
about yet.”

The most complimentary re-
mark c.am-e from a junior who
stated that, in his opinion, this
year’s crop -does injustice to the
saying “beautiful but dumb,” and
he added, “They’re not only pret-
ty but witty too.” A smooth sophis-
ticated senior decided, “They’re
cute, but about the same as al-
ways.”

So that brings this communique
to a climax and the “Gallup-ing”
to a conclusion. Well gals, now
that you‘ve heard the results of
our noble experiment, what do
you think? But puh-leeze remem-
ber, watch your language.

In Studies, Too

The fast-stepping young man
at the Soph Hop who won the jit-
terbug contest two week-ends ago
was Larry Burwinkle, C, captain

’ of the cheerleaders at Pitt. Out of ’

a crowd of six hundred, Larry and
his date from Mount Mercy, Ruth
Donnelly, caught the judges’ eyes
and literally danced away with
the prize.

Larry, however, denies that he’s
an ardent jitterbug, says only that
he “likes to dance” and that he
dances better with Ruth than with
any other girl. The latter, he in-
sists, is really the reason they
were selected.

A second-semester freshman in
the University, Larry is in the en-
listed reserve of the air corps and
expects to be called to active serv-
ice s-ometime in May. However,
he’s hoping he’ll~b_e able to remain
for th next summer’s semester.

Although some people may
think Larry’s main concern is his
dancing, it isn’t. “I want to make
a success of my studies,” he said.
“Social life comes 1ast.” Then

away he went to write an English
theme.

tion, with the aid of costumes,
make-up and setting, should pre-
sent to the audience a picture of
Old Spain. The main characters
in the play are two old lovers
who meet one day by chance in
the park and are reunited after
years of separation. At ﬁrst their
conversation is limited to grunts
and nods of the head, but gradu-
ally they begin to chat about an
old love affair in which they were
the lovers. From then on the play
moves rapidly and ends with a
novel twist. '

The old lovers are portrayed by
Sally Watkins, C, as Dona Laura
and Frank Fertschneider, C, as
Don Gonzalo. Last spring Sally
was in the chorus of Furlough but

not for Long while Frank, a war
veteran, worked this summer with
the Players in A Happy Journey,
by Thornton Wilder.

The only other characters in A
Sunny Morning are two servants,
Petra and Junito, played by Jan-
ice Segal, C, and Richard Davis,
C. Janice, a young maid in love
with the park guard, and Richard,
the lazy servant of Don Gonzalo,
are appearing for the first time in
a Pitt Players production.

Miss Strutzel, who is also presi-
dent of Pitt Players, commented
on future plans? “This year we
shall start climbing back up the
ladder. Now that we have more
men at the University and a larg-
er student body to draw from, we
are planning a bigger and more
productive season.” During the
coming year the Players hope to
present, besides several
skits, a Christmas story. a three-
act play, the regular spring musi-
cal, and the three one-act plays
already in rehearsal. Students in-
terested in attending this ﬁrst
production will be able to pur-
chase tickets in two weeks.

Starting where we ended last
week, Phi Sigma Sigma is having
its annual dessert-bridge Sunday
afternoon in the Hotel Schenley
ballroom. Proceeds from the
bridge will be given to the War
Prisoners Relief sponsored by the
Red Cross. The Phi Sigs have
planned a rafﬂe, and I hear—now
don’t get too excited girls-—that
there is a possible chance that the
door prize will be a pair of nylons.
The chairman of the affair is Ruth
Goldberg. Here’s wishing the girls
luck "in this worthy cause.

The alumnae of Phi Mu are giv-
ing’ a reception tonight at their
apartment. And Tuesday_ evening
the Phi Mus honored their new
pledges with dinner at the Fairfax
dining room.

Carolyn Sottile, TPA social
chairman, will have the Theta
Phi Alpha house decked out with
turkeys, cardboard ones, of course,
and all sorts of Thanksgiving‘ dec-
orations for their Thanksgiving
dance on November 22. ‘

Dessert at the Zeta house will
start the’ Zetas off on their Ice
Capade party at the Duquesne
Gardens Monday, November 20.

Nine‘  Delts went to Ohio
State ‘last week-end to see the

there.’ . And the stay-at-home Tri

night. . '

The AEPhis gave a dinner party
yesterday at their apartment for
Phyllis Levine and Bob Davis who

are soon to be married. More
congratulations are in order.
The Phi Delts and Phi Grams

are getting together in a big way

next Friday evening for a joint

dance. This is the ﬁrst “Good
Neighbor” affair of the season,
and I’m told that the other fra-
ternities are considering more of
them.

The Pi Lams pledged two more
boys last week. The new men are
Len Schorr and Albert Hilton.

And not to be surpassed by
anyone, the Sigma Chis also
pledged more boys. Sig pledges
are Ralph Garbe, Joseph Pahlow,
and William Robinson.

Last Friday evening, the SAEs
from Pitt went over to the Tech
SAE house for a stag. As their
special guests, the boys had mem-
bers of Pitt’s veterans’ associa-
tion.

The Phi'Eps who went up to
Ohio State last week—end got a
big kick out of staying. in a fra-
ternity house. They were the
guests of the Ohio State chapter,
which had a house dance for them

And it’s back again after the big

fat week-end in Columbus, for the
Pitt-Ohio State game. Ah, what
women, what fraternity houses,
what women, what a time! But
let’s haul in the anchor and get
going».

Medals to Pitt cheerleaders
Sandy Lampl, Dick Seewald, and
Jim Ludwig who really showed
up OSU’s cheerleaders last Sat-
urday; not only in their riotous
football game at the half-which
the rah-rah boys from Pittsburgh
won’ 18 to 0 and which got a write-
up in at least one of the Columbus
papers—but also in the bang-up
job they did in leading the army,
Ohio’s band, and the twenty—odd
Pittites cheering in the stands.

And those 25 students, too, put
up a good show by cheering them-
selves hoarse. (But then husky
voices have charm, don’t you
think? Or don’t you?) They made
more noise than the whole cheer-
ing section at home games.

Notes from a big week—end: The
Tri Delt open house where the
girls apologized for the knock—out—
looking rooms, saying that they
were going to redecorate in a few
weeks . . pitch darkness at the
PiKA “rushing dance” . . . Delts
and dates bouncing off in a mov-
ing van to a brawl the SAEs
threw for them at a local dive
. . . Jim Ludwig and Bill Veenis
pal-ing it at Valley Dale (We’d
better say no more) . ﬂood-
lights on the snowwwhite Kappa
house at night (and an extra
whistle for their candidate for
Homecoming Queen) . Ruth
Crawford teaching the OSU Fijis
some Phi Gam songs . . two
pennies and a note from Ann Fol-
lansbee in the stands to Les Sarles
on the bench (How ’bout that?)

. . Pitt’s Bill Mitchell and Ohio’s
“Porky” Woods——in half an hour
he was almost ready to transfer
(shemale charm, ya know).

But now back home again to

Pittsburgh where we ﬁnd our little
stay—at-home friends .

Last Sunday Chi 0 Connie Stew-
art, who has connections with the
Ice Capades, brought Donna At-
wood (deﬁnitely on the oomphy
side) over to the house with her.
Celebrities, yet.

The cry in the Tuck Shop these
days is-—we see Zimmovan play
football, we hear a lot about him,
but do we ever see him around the
Tuck Shop? Come on out, Kelly.
We’re Waitin’.

Pitt, Tech, Mount Mercy, and
Duquesne were represented at the
Newman club’s big shindig--their
first of the year—-on Saturday
night. The TPA’s and Phi Kaps
scampered over to CIT’s Thistle
hall for the big event.

Ann Whitlinger is out of town
this week——via choo choo to New

..Jersey for a big time at a friend’s

wedding.

But enough of these gruesome
generalities for this week. You
can see us Wednesday morningin
the Tuck Shop, where hatchets,
Bowie knives, and pearl-handled
revolvers will be on sale for use
by students.

Wanta’ borrow Barnhart’s “ho”
this week to give a big, fat ho for
the 27 Pitt students who traveled
to Columbus this past week—end
for the Ohio State-Pitt game. It
resulted in the biggest display of
school spirit at any one football
game this year. Ho! Twenty-seven
papas walk to work for the next
month—no gas! (Rather over-
working ho this week, aren’t we?)

The cheering section started out
with eight people who had seats
in the reserved bleachers. Some
bright—bra’in decided to collect the
reserved ticket stubs and dis-
tribute them to Pittites sitting in
the general admission section. Re-
sult——solid mass of 27 people
cheering “like mad” (?)

After" the game several sorority
houses were having open house

0'0

Course open to graduates and

J little OSU

to celebrate homecoming. Each
sorority entered a nominee for
“Homecoming Queen.” We sub-
mitted Melnnel (High - Pockets)
Smithis name from Pitt.

A John Onefrey vwalked into a
crowd agitating general, and then
speciﬁcally by claiming that “lf
we’d had 10 more minutes. we’d
a’ smeared ya!” Whereupon some
man pipes up with
“Yeah: You sure did give our ﬁfth
team a tough ﬁght!”

Rusty (Mother) Clarke solved

the train problem by introducing '

all the girls to traveling service-
men. '

Those who went to and back by
car ‘hit a new high in ﬁat tires.
Bob (No, No, Jimmy) Bue1l’s tea-
kettle was pronounced unsafe by
somebody who knew and was
avoided by all but 7 of his loyal

frat brothers who went along just _

to prove something. (I dare ya to

ask what!) . .
Walt Stewart asphyxiated every-

body in his car by smoking

his meerschaum during the whole -- _ ,
trip, and Barb Owens further con-_ _

fused us by keeping an eye on the
route numbers. After we’d taken it
for granted that we’d been follow-
ing Route 40 for about 25 miles
Barb sudidenly screamed, “All I
see is Route 35!” We’d been fol-
lowing the speed limit--35 miles—-
signs from Columbus to Zanes-
ville!

Freshman Mary Jane Tracy
Beta Theta Pi-ed it at Columbus
all week-end. Jug Crock was also
in town, but didn’t make the
game. Her soldier steady proved
a bigger attraction.

Rare Manuscript
Sent To Rome

A photostatic copy of the origi-
nal and apparently unpublished
manuscript of Duns Scotus’ Super
Quattuor Libros Sententiarum has
been sent by the Darlington Me-
morial library to the Co-llegio
Internationale Di San Antonio in
Rome.

This manuscript of the famous
Scottish philosopher was present-
ed to the Darlington Memorial

library by Thomas Mellon. Lois

Mulkearn, librarian in the Dar-
lington room, says that the photo-
static copy is being used by the
editors in their scholastic research
on a critical edition of Duns
Scotus’ works.‘

The manuscript is of ﬁne vel-
lum, written in two columns on
50 leaves. Since it was generally
used by ﬁfteenth—century students
of philosophy, it has no ornaments
except initial letters painted in
red and rubrications. The signa-
ture -of the scribe and the date .at
the end of the text add to the
value of the manuscript.

[Fresh Women '

. Join Guilds

For the ﬁrst time in Pitt his-
tory, freshman women will be
permitted to join two guilds dur-
ing their second semester. This
plan will enable a freshman wom-

an to explore more than one ac-
tivity in which she is interested
and learn the basic information
of the organization to which the
guild is allied.

The choice of guilds will not
necessarily determine the particu-
lar activities a girl may enter
after her freshman year,

At the ﬁrst freshman woman's
assembly on November 30," each
girl will meet with the guild she
has chosen. She has been given
an opportunity to make a first
and second choice from the fif-
teen available guilds. If the guild
of her ﬁrst choice has been ﬁlled
to capacity this plan will enable
her to join her second choice in
February.

Including the eight new guilds
the list is as follows Pitt News
Editorial guild, Pitt News Busi-
ness guild, Women’s Speech guild,
Woman’s Athletic guild, Woman’s
Choral guild, Pitt Players Acting
guild, Pitt Players Technical
guild, Y.W.C.A. guild, Student
Hostess guild, Heinz Chapel Choir
guild, Heinz Chapel guild, War
Activities guild, Owl Editorial
guild, Owl Business guild, and
Commons Room guild.

Veterans Club
Stages Drive
For Members

Pitt veterans! Here is your op-
portunity to become part of a pro-

gressive organization that is ex-
clusively by and for veterans of
World War II who are enrolled in
the undergraduate schools of the
University.

The Pitt Veterans club has been
on campus for mo-re than three se-
mesters. Its early days were
marked by the eﬁorts -of the char-
ter members to overcome the diffi-
culties which usually confront the
founders of a new organization.
But, with the. increased entrance
of ex—servicemen ‘into the Univer-
sity, the club shows promise of
becoming one of the smoothest
functioning bodies at ‘Pitt.

The club is planning an ex-
panded program of social activi-
ties that should go far toward as-
suring its success.
phasis will be placed upon the fos-
tering of fellowship among stu-'-
dent veterans. Most of all, the full
cooperation o-f a majority of the
veterans is urgently needed.

For this reason, the Pitt Veter-
ans club is now staging its ﬁrst
major membership drive to en-
roll new members from the large
veteran group which recently en-
tered the University. The drive
will close on November 30, after
which day the club will be clos-
ed to new membership unt‘il the
following semester. »

The next business meeting will
be held ‘Monday, November 20, at
3:30 o’clo-ck in room 144 Cathe-

  ¢U/talc/zca Know /10’/ae?

By Moe Spiegel, Sports Editor

The Panthers won a half a game
at Columbus against those amaz-
ing civilians of Ohio State. Pitt
fans were satisﬁed. No one
thought that our “kids” would do
as well against the Buckeyes, even
if the Bucks did have a bunch of
subs in there. The passing arm of
Paul Rickards again was the bright
spot in the attack of our Cats.

Now it’s Indiana that looms upon
the grid horizon, and the ozone
should be ﬁlled with the pigskin
as the ‘Shaughnessys battle the
Hoosiers at Bloomington this Sat-
urday. The I n d i a n s have
“Hunchy” Hoernschemeyer, one of
the outstanding passers this sea-
son. It will be interesting to see
Rickards tossing against “Hunchy.”
Football is a great game, don’tcha
agree? The skies‘ of London are
ﬁlled with deadly robot bombs be-
cause of a little bag of wind, A.
Hitler; the skies of Bloomington
will be ﬁlled with a little bag of
wind, a football.

The Number One Team?

The grid season is drawing to a
close with just a few more weeks
to go, and the speculation as to
which squad is the No. 1 team in
the nation is getting the notices.
Army looked like pros by decapi-
tating Notre Dame; Ohio State has
everything; Navy is coming along
after two upsets; Randolph Field
and several other service elevens
are terrorizing their opponents.
These teams have practically noth-
ing to fear when they trot out onto
the gridiron. They are so power-
ful, so loaded down with talent,
that they scare opponents like Joe
Louis used to do when he was
kayoing foes right and left.

Here’s what I am driving at.
Pitt has beaten three weak teams
while losing to Notre Dame, Army,
Illinois and Ohio State. These
four teams are among the nation’s
best. The Panthers have taken
such drubbings that a record total
of 247 points has been scored
against them already and there are
two games left to play. Now, with
a sure walloping in store for them
as they faced each of these four

teams, did Pitt ‘fail to put up a
ﬁght? Did Pitt lack the courage
to go -on? Did the Panthers ever
admit that they were in for a
beating? The answer to all these
is . . NO! The team, in my
opinion, deserves some sort of
recognition. They have been in-
jured; they have been laid up for
the remainder of the season; they
have been carried off the ﬁeld only
to come back ﬁghting . . . and be
carried off again, and come back
again.

We aren’t taking any of the
glory away from Army or Ohio
State or any of the other “big
boys.” We can’t anyway. But
just remember this . . . Pitt, this
year, has one of theﬁnest little
teams to represent the school.
Even if they are not winning, the

players are showing that the Uni--

versity of Pittsburgh is not afraid
to take a licking; that Pitt is bid-
ing its time and that the moment
will soon” arrive when other teams
will walk out on the ﬁeld and take
their licking and walk off with
heads erect and looks of determi-
nation on the players’ faces.

In Feature Game

Just in case you want to know
the real score of the Ohio State-

Saturday, it, was Pitt 18, Ohio

There was more interest in that

the Ohio side to lead a cheer, but
the Ohio yellmen gave them the
old heave-ho. l The Pitt boys

PiKAs Overrun All Opposition

The PiKAs, unleashing a power-
ful passing attack, smothered the
Sigma Chis, 52-0, and the SAES,
84-0. It was mainly the PiKA line
led by Labash and King that de-
moralize-d opponents. Behind this
powerful line the PiKAs have won
four games, scoring over 42
points a game, while holding their
opponents scoreless.

Phi Delts Win First

After losing four straight deci-
sions to the stronger teams of the
league, the Phi Delts downed the
SAEs, 12-6. The only SAE score
came on a surprise pass after they
had received the kickoff. In their
second game of the week the Phi
Delts were beaten by the Pi
Lambs, 12-6. «Strengthened by
Nate Apple, the Pi Lambs domin-
ated the play throughout.

“You Big Bully”

University of Minnesota cheer-
leaders areartists of showman-
ship and have perfected a tech-
nique of clowning and roughing
which keeps the fans howling
with laughter. It starts with Earl

Mahachek declaring loudly that
Minnesota will not win the game.
Then Arnie Gilbertson knocks him
down and Paul Samuels picks
him up, pushes him back, and
Arnie knocks him down again.

It is a vicious circle. The cheer-
leading lads and lassies put it
over with such vigor that, after
the recent Michigan game -during
which Earl was knocked down
several times, an old lady rushed
up to Arnie and scolded him
soundly for “picking on someone
smaller than himself.”

IF Grid "Rules
Changed *

Rules concerning the playing of
IF football games were discussed
at a meeting of the Interfraternity
council held in the Pi Lambda Phi
house on November 7.

At the suggestion of the athletic
chairman, it was ‘decided that
henceforth spiked and cleated
shoes are not to be worn for IF
football and mushball games. It
was also ruled that, for gridiron
games, each team is to wear jer-
seys of a distinctive color. Ques-
tion was also raised as to the
eligibility of fraternity men to
play football if they are taking
less than 12 credits, The council
therefore voted that all men able
to pledge fraternity are able to
participate in fraternity activities.
Discussion pertaining to basketball
was shelved until the next meet-
ing.

Hoosiers Next PittFoe

The Panthers will hit the road
again this week-end when they
are to travel westward to meet
the Indiana Hoosiers, a member
of the Big Nine. B-oth teams are
nursing a defeat: Pitt a setback
by Ohio State, and the Hoosiers
an upset by Minnesota, making
this a game which will put some-
one back in the victory column.

Reorganized

Band Ready

Mr. R. L. Arthur, assistant to
the dean of men, and Captain Fin-
nerty are cooperating to prepare
a colorful program for the specta-
tors at the Pitt-Penn State game,
Saturday, November 25. Yes,
there will be a PITT BAND con-
sisting of probably 75 members
clad in blue and gold uniforms,
marching down the ﬁeld for Pitt
again.

Mr. Arthur says that only 12
men were former Pitt band mem-
bers but all have musical ability.
There are 22 musical parts, and he
promises that the boys will be
able to play all 22 parts by the
time of the game. As usual it will
be a military band, although
eleven fair ladies will help out in
the performances during the half;

Captain Finnerty, acting drill
master, set up the blueprints while
Mr. Arthur made up the musical
arrangements, and‘ somehow the
timing and drilling came out to
equal “Roger”! This is the be-
ginning of our new Pitt band so
“Strike Up the Band” to Mr.
Arthur and Captain Finnerty for
getting us back on the beam.

The Panthers, although display-

Both Pitt and Indiana have
played Ohio State, with the
Hoosiers going down in a 21-7
defeat. The Hoosiers out-played
and out-fought the Buckeyes the
first half, but in the second half,
Horvath out-shone Hoernsche-
meyer and the Staters won. The
power of Indiana can’t be under-

estimated, as they hold a 72-0 de-
cision over Fort Knox, walloped
Nebraska 54-0, set Michigan, 20-

added‘ another tilt at the expense
of Northwestern with a score of
14-7, and then gained their ﬁnal
Big Nine victory by lacing Iowa,
32-0. The Hoosiers are now in a

College Offers

Record Exam

The Graduate Record examina-
tion is to be given on the Pitt
campus on the afternoons of De-

cember 11 and 12. These examina-
tions are required of all advanced
sophomores. The University bears
the expense of the examination
for advanced sophomores. Other
students, however, who.may wish
to take the examination must do
so at their own expense. There
is a fee of $1.50 to Pitt students
who wish to take the examination.

The examination is quite use-
ful to students in ﬁnding out ex-
actly how much they have thus

far learned in their college career.
It is useful also to faculty advisers
in planning programs for the last
two years of the college course.
The examinations are not used in
any way to the disadvantage of
the student but are rather intend-
ed to assist him.

Arrangements for taking the
examination must be made in ad-
vance of the examination date by
completing a registration schedule.
These may be obtained at the Col-

Smith Leaves
Position Here

For Capitol

On November 21, Mrs. Florence
B. Smith, secretary to Dr. R. H.
Fitzgerald, vice-chancellor of the
University will leave the posi-
tion she has held‘ for 12 years to
join her husband, Lt. Lawrence
H. Smith, in Washington, D. C.
Lt. H. Smith is a printing engi-
neer and -chief of the printing sec-
tion in the Navy Bureau of Pub-
lications in Washington.

Mrs. Smith ca-me to Pitt on No-
vember 14, 1932, as secretary to
the treasurer. VVhen Dr. Fitzger-
ald came to Pittsburgh as provost
of the University, she then be-
came his secretary and has
worked’ for him ever since. Mrs.
Smith began her working career
a week before her graduation from
Sewickley high school on June 15,
1925.

Gardening of any kind is Mrs.
Smith’s greatest enjoyment. How-
ever, she says she will just have
to get used to hoeing in a window
box in Washington for the dura-
tion. But after the war, Lt. and
Mrs. Smith plan to return to their
home and garden in White Oak
heights near North park.

‘On leaving the University, Mrs.
Smith says, “My associations
have brought to me a rich ex-
perience, particularly my work
with Dr. Fitzgerald.” Mrs. Smith’s
successor here will be Mrs. Gladys
Gardner, former secretary to Dr.
J. P. Watson, director of the
Bureau of Business Research.

‘v

will be notiﬁed, and arrangements
for their registration are being
made through the sophomore Eng-
lish classes.

Faculty members who are inter-
ested in taking the examination
themselves may do so without
charge. They must also register
in advance of the examination.

Merchant Marine
Recruits Here

Permission to recruit men be-
tween the ages of 18 and 26, who
have not received induction no-
tices, has again been granted to
the War Shipping Administration.
by Selective Service. This means
that all electrical, mechanical, and
marine engineering students who
have completed three years of
their college course are now
eligible, regardless of age or draft
classiﬁcation, for service in the
Merchant Marine.

The applicant's college trans- ~
cript must be sent through the »

WSA to the U. S. Coast Guard
in Washington, D. C., for deter-
mination of how much sea time
is needed before becoming eligible
for a third -assistant engineer’s
license. This must be done prior
to the issuance of seaman’s papers,
and the college transcripts must
be certiﬁed by the registrar of
the school attended.

Dr. Peitz of the War Ship-
ping administration will be on
the campus next Friday morn- ‘
ing. He will interview inter-
ested men in the social room of
the ‘Stephen Foster memorial
at 8:40, 9:40, 10:40, and 11:40
o’clock. No classes will be ad-
journed. All men are urged’ to
attend at one hour.

All interested qualiﬁed appli-
cants are urged to apply without
delay, as the Merchant Marine
has a vital need for college
trained engineers. The present
global warfare is pushing Mer-
chant Marine personnel to the
limit and qualiﬁed men are
needed badly to assist in the task
of supplying our ﬁghting men.

Fred McCurdy To Lead
Chapel Service Friday

Fred McCurdy, of the Phi -Gam- 
ma Delta fraternity, will be stu-- ;
dent leader at the chapel service 0
this Friday at one o’clock. The 3

Heinz Chapel choir, under the di-

rection of Theodore M. Finney,

will sing an anthem.

Dr. William R. Farmer has been
delivering a series of lectures on
the interpretation of the Heinz
Chapel windows. Friday he spoke
of the “Faith” window of the
chancel and how students can ap-
ply this virtue in daily life. This
week Dr. Farmer will explain the

“Hope” window, which is on the A

right of the “Charity” window
over the altar in the Heinz Chapel.
