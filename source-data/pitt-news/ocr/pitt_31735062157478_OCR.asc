Panthers Bust Loose
In Locker Room ,
After Indiana Upset

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Pandemonium has reigned in VVorld Series locker. rooms,
in Rose Bowl locker rooms, and in Stanley Cup locker rooms,
but it is hard to imagine it reigning more absolutely than it
did in the Pitt locker room on Satiirday.

The reason, of course, was the 21-14 victory over Indiana.

In one corner of the close, stench-ﬁlled room, 210-pound
tackle Nick ‘Bolkovae was furiously pumping ‘the hand of line
coach Jesse Quatse in‘ a manner that made it questionable
whose arm would drop oif ﬁrst.

At regular intervals, players hurled themselves around
Nick’s neck, some of them plunging from atop benches in
order to accomplish said hugging. Bolkovac had kicked three
extra points in the game. _

At the Opposite end of the room, Jimmy Joe Robinson, who
caught the game-winning pass, was the center of attraction. Big
Walt -Cummins, Bobby Lee, and about a half dozen others surround-
ed Jimmy Joe, hugging and back—slapping him vigorously. '

Chunky Flint Green managed to crowd into the group and work
in a hug and a kiss now and then.

Bimbo Cecconi, the boy who threw the touchdown pass, wasn’t
even in the room. He was outside, trying to ﬁght his way through
a gauntlet ofiwild admirers.

In the midst of all the dressing room merriment, a loud roar
went up from the players. Head Coach Mike Milligan had just writ-
ten in large white letters on the wall blackboard, “NO PRACTICE
MONDAY.”

Confusion in the Pitt locker room exceeded even that which took
place after last year’s win over Ohio State.

Photographers were standing on benches, their ﬂash bulbs pop-
ping; reporters were barking questions at players and coaches. Alum-
ni were striding about, beaming at each other. _

Across the way in the Indiana dressing room, there was a per-
fect contrast. Only the hiss of a running shower penetrated the still-
ness. - . N».

Tech Students
Join Paraders
In Celebration

Pitt had company yesterday
when, following Dean of Men
Theodore Bid_dle’s statement
that ‘we’ll go. ‘along with you;
thousands of -victory-liappy
Pittites marched to the Tech
campus to join with thousands
more defeat—maddened Skibos.

The victory parade, following
the band from Soldiers and Sail-
ors Memorial Hall, scene of‘the
oﬁicial rally, marched up
Forbeslstreet, overwhelming the
sidewalks and lawns and leaving
lines of dismasted trolleys in their
wake. _

At the Carnegie Tech entrance.
the band split off to the left, while
the throng poured up over the CIT
campus,_ met and joined by_ over

 

3000 Techites protesting President.’

Robert Doherty’s rigid football de-
emphasis.

‘Led by Robert Dickey, former
Pitt cheerleader, and the leader
of the Tech insurrection, cheer-
leader George Cash, the combined
mob yelled, cheered, and sang in
front of the school’s administration
building.

Pinned on one of Saturday’s
fractured goalposts was a Tech
placard proclaiming “Protest
Rally on the Cut, Join With Pitt!”
Dickey and Cash alternated in

- leading cheers and songs, followed
by a squealing bagpipe rendition

by an unidentiﬁed member of the
Kiltie Band. ‘

Building,‘ the crowd flowed back
to the broad Tech practice ﬁeld
for more songs and cheers, then
split up, with some Techites re-
turning to class, others following
a large body of Pitt students as
they marched on PCW. As a
smaller body of Pittites headed
down Forbes Street to the Cathe-
dral, police squad carsand motor-
cycles began arriving on the scene.

As the News went to press.
bands of roving cars loaded with
students shuttled between down-
town and Oakland with horns
blaring.

tion was more orderly than last

est’ and most sustained, ovation
was the one which greeted Chan-
cellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald when
he appared late in the program.
Beaming like a high school boy,
Dr. Fitzgerald ﬁnally broke in
with a breathless review of the

‘ Cecconi to Robinson play that won

,Saturday’s game. As he left the
stage, a ‘No School Today’ -chant
followed him.

Coach Mike Milligan’s short ad'-
adress was interrupted continu-
ally by cheering, and with a_ rare
display of emotion he ended by
quoting the Pitt Chant. Later he
introduced the gridders seated on
the stage, each one mumbling
‘thanks a lot’ into the microphone.

The rally ended shortly after
10:30 a. m. with the Alma Mater,
the band leaving and forming out-

-side to begin the traﬁic—stopping

parade that followed.

While not quite so wild as last‘

year’s day—1ong celebration, and
confused by‘a misunderstanding
of whether classes would be held
or not, Pitt, aided by Tech, man-
aged to let Pittsburgh know that

someone still has a football team

in town.

Clyde Smith, the Hoosier’s head coach. The downcast little man.
stared at the ﬂoor and murmured, “That Pitt team just played’

A burly gridder puts his hands on the reporter’s shoulders and
said, “Look, why don’tcha leave Smitty alone. Those were his own
people out there in the stands today.” - a

‘fThat catch of Jimmy Joe’s gave me the biggest thrill of my

Pitt students shared Mike’s jubilance. It was like "old times.

Movie Lowers
I Anti-Semifism
Report Says

Pitt studentsshowed an increase

in tolerance toward Jews after
Lviewingithe motion picture “Gen-
'tlernan’s Agreement,” according to
a recent article published in The
Journal of Psychology.

Written by Irwin C. Rosen, lec-
turer and graduate student here,
the article deals with a series of
attitude tests given 140 psychology
students here last Spring.

According to the article, 73 per
cent of the experimental group
showed a more favorable attitude
toward Jews and 26 per cent be-
came less favorable after seeing
the picture.

Other, results revealed by the
article, which was submitted as a
Master’s thesis by Mr. Rosen, re-
vealed that 73 per cent of the stu-
dents thought that the movie was
propaganda. Of this group, 29 per
cent indicated that it was “good”
‘propaganda, 44. per .cent either
stated simply that it‘ was propa-
ganda or indicated an unfavorable
opinion.

The remainder of the students,
27 per cent, denied that the pic--
ture was propaganda and defend-
ed the factual nature of the ma-

0 -terial in the ﬁlm. '

Although a Jewish "students! par-
ticipated in the tests, their scores
were eliminated fromv the statis-

'plus to a college education that a

MIAMI——-Men are better house-
keepers and much easier to work
for than girls.

This is the observation of Mrs.
Annie Sutphin, who supervises\
the maid service for 110 apart-
ments in the mens dormitory at

the University of Miami.

Mrs. Sfuphin, whoworked for
several years in family hotels
and apartments, has found the
boys to be good housekeepers as
a whole. They are easy to please

and less likely than family
groups to make demands for spec-
ial services. . ‘ _

“Around the ﬁrst of the month
some of the apartments are found
in pretty bad shape, evidently as
a result of a party,” "Mrs. Sutphin
said. She declined to say if she

thought there was any connection
between the arrival of subsistence
checks and this evidence of minor
celebrations. .,

Male Housekeeping ,
Better Than Female

.One occurence convinced her

that chivalry’ isn’t dead. She,
was making a routine check in an
apartment when one of the occu-
pants came in. Not knowing that
she was there, he started to swear.
The other boys hushed him
quickly. '

He apologized, sat down, and
made a sign to hang on the wall.
It read, “Watch Your Language!”
Then he explained, “That’s so I
won’t ‘make that mistake again.’

Although the boys are .very
careless about leaving their jewel-
ry and money laying around, there,
have been no losses reported to
the housing office. This is an ex-

ceptional record, Mrs. Sutphin
thinks, as the maids are gener-
ally blamed with taking anything
that is missing. ~ ;
One student did accuse a maid
of drinking. his bottle of milk. but‘
the girl denied this accusation.
She admitted a fondness for milk
but claimed that she never drank
any because it put on weight.

Took a notion to amble up to the twelfth
-ﬂoor recreation room ..yesterday. Being a
normal, inquisitive freshman with a typi-
cally abnormal freshman schedule, I was
blessed with quite a parcel of loose time on
my hands between classes.
So, envisioning a fast game of ping. pong,
I enlisted a male confederate in my little
scheme and muscled into a strategic spot to
I ﬂag an elevator. Then we recalled one little
detail hadiescaped us: women. To put it in
a Cahrles Boyerian sense: “Cherchez une
femmt "A pour vous and pour votre ami!”
V_Vhich, when well-mangled and loosely trans-
lated, might come to mean, “Find yourself
a girl, bud, or you can’t get in!” — _‘.
Still nurturing the idea of this ping pong

contest on the twelfth ﬂoor ﬁeld of honor," .

"we began a quest for two eligible but idle
female Tuck Shoppers who might, with a
little prodding, harboringthe same idea as
we. It wasn’t too hard. Soon, suitably es-
corted, We were penned in an elevator on
‘our_ way to the fray.

Our’ troubles, -however, were nlounting,
too. Perhaps inducediby the sight of the
‘room, our escorts were seized with ﬁts of
girlish coyness——we. cou.ldn’t corral" them.

wrist tactics. \Ve entered. '

The ﬁrst glance was" not 1'cassu1'ing'. ;
Card tables, a piano, and a ping pong table
stood out against the gray windows; a throb- _
bing boogie woogie beat against the bare,
brick walls. I guess it was too n1uch.»Our
female passports bolted and in a. second had
slipped through the door.

Refusing to recognize the situation as a .
lost cause, we continued on alone, still un-
ﬂaggingly bent on our game ‘of ping pong.’

At the table we met the crowd and Wav-.
ered+but no! It‘1I1l1S1Z be ping pong. not

One of these days, University
oﬁicials feel the Pitt News will
have, to run a storysomething like
this:

“A Pitt‘ student was severely
injured yesterday morning when
a car ran him down as he attempt-
ed to cross a street in violation
of traffic signals. '

“The student, Bolivar T. Shag-
nasty, and engineer, is listed as in
serious condition by Presbyterian
Hospital. He suffered a brain con-
cussion and lacerations of the face
and neck.

“Shaganasty was attempting to
cross Bayard Street‘ at the corner
of that street and Bigelow Boule-
_vard, in front of the Twentieth
Century Club.-' Evidently on his
Way to the Cathedral from State,
Hall, he was one of about twenty
students who attempted to cross
the street in violation of a stop
light. The rest made it across.
Shagnasty didn’t.”

Can Happen Here

That’s the story. And it can hvap‘-_
pen here, University oﬁicials
pointed "out. In fact, they" say, it
probably will happen here if stu-
dents aren’t more careful about
obeying traffic, signals in the Oak-
land District.

The point to all this is that the

They had carefully plotted two screen pases which had
nearly been good enough for_a tie with the aroused Panthers.
But a. pass play, started by Bimbo Cecconi and suspeiisefully and
elimaetically completed. by Jimmy Joe .Robinson with 1:10‘
remaining the game, gave the Panthers 21. 21-14 upset success.

Thrilling Pass Catch
Brings 21-14 Victory

By 5013 VAN ATTA _
Two Indiana coaches diseonsolately slirugged their should-
ers, muttered, ‘”l‘hat’s football,” and left the Pitt Stadium press’
box for Blooniington, Tndiima. with their heads between their

ged high, hard, and long to Jimmy
5 Joe Robinson standing some 60
yards downﬁeld'on the Indiana 20.

Jimmy Joe juggled the ‘ban,
wheeled, caught it again and
sped oif into the promised land
with a grin on his face that ex-
; tended from one sideof the Sta~
‘ dium to the other.
, The line play of the Panthers,
iparticularly that of Chuck Yost
and Nick Bolkovac, was outstand-
ing. Several defensive gems were
turned ‘in by -Walt Cummins at
quarterback. M

After Leo Skladany returned
the opening kickoff eight yards to
the Pitt 38, the Panthers drove to
the Indiana _23 in eight plays.
From there, on last down, Jimmy

' Joe aerialed to Bi1l,McPeak in the

end zone for the ﬁrst score.

Bolkovac swung his right leg
at just the proper degree to auto-
matically add the seventh point
by placement.

With only seconds remaining in
the ﬁrst half, Becker bulled across
from two yards out for the second
Pitt TD. The play climaxed a 71-
yard sustained drive after McPeak
recovered George .Taliaferro’s
fumble on the Pitt 29.

Setting up Becker’s ﬁnal plunge
was Bimbo _ Cecconi’s 16-yard
sprint from the 18 after he had
gone back to pass and instead
found the center lane open.

Two passes from Taliaferro to
Harry McDonnell carried the
Hoosiers 84 yards for their ﬁrst
score at 9:00 of the third period.
The second was a screen pass

kicker George Parker was equal
tothe conversion chore.

Seven ‘plays after the ﬁnal
quarter got under way, Nick Se-
bek hit Taliaferro on ‘a similar
screen pass play'that carried 80
yards and featured a neat bit of
sideline stepping by the Hoosier
hotshot. '

Parker deadlocked the contest
with his ‘second placement.

Following three unsuccessful ef-
forts from their own 20, Taliafer—
i‘o_punted to the.Pitt 38, vsrhere
Cecconi wisely signalled for a
fair catch. On the ﬁrst play, Bim-
bo connected with Robinson for
the winning score.

Pitt Big choice

At Cleveland

After Keeping, company," most

gridiron giants of varying strength

ing Panthers roll into Cleveland
Friday night doubtlessly rated a

goliath by the" impotent football"

forces of Western Reserve.

The Pitts, taking to the road

after performing ‘ﬁve consecutive
Saturdays in the Oakland bowl,
have boosted their football stock
to such a point. that, should the
Red Cats surprise them Saturday,
it would be considered a big up-
set, at least locally.
. Western Reserve adherents
and Pitt pessimists point to the
Clevelanders’ improved ‘showing
in two of their last three starts as
dangerous to the favorites.

The Red Cats showed strength
in checking Kent State (Ohio), a
decided favorite, 14-14, Saturday,
two weeks after they had record-
ed their only victory, a 6-0 job
over Butler.

The rest of their games they
would just as soon forget. They
came out on the very short end of
scores of 26-0 with Western Mich-I
igan, 34-6 against Detroit, 49-0
with Miami (Ohio), and 37-7
against the ﬁghting Ohio Univer-
sity Bobcats.

Again this week the scheduled appointments at the Red Cross Blood
Bank are far below the requests of the eterans Hospital in Aspinwall, and
many donors must be recruited immediately in .order to bring up the quota
for this week. The doctors at the hospital informed the Red Cross that their
supply of blood is very low and an ample amount must be on hand for the
numerous operations. scheduled next Week.

Thousands of lives of Wounded ﬁghting men were saving during the
war, because blood, in the form of plasma, was readily available, even in the
frontline foxholes. Likewise if whole blood is at the disposal of the doctors

' at Aspinwall, whenever needed, it ’will again help to save the lives of many
ex—servicemen and hasten their recovery.

The Red Cross Blood Bank is open every Thursday from 1:30 in the
afternoon to 8:30 in the evening. Donors must be in good health and must be
between the ages of 21 and 50.

Panther Uncorks New Party:
Read Al! About it Next Week

Making a second try this year for collegiate fame, the next
issue of the Panther magazine is scheduled to hit the stands next

Monday.

Although the contents of this isue were supposedly a well kept
secret, the News has uncovered the fact that the Panther will come
out in support of a political party in the coming election.

The magazine has thrown every ounce of its support, including

that of its huge student following,‘

behind Prohibition with a colorful
and subtle campaign for the elec-
tion of Prohibition Party men.

At. football games for the past
two weeks Jim Passaner, Prohi-
bition supporter, has appeared
carrying a “Vote Prohibition"
placard. However, some spectators
questioned the wisdom of his
wearing his hillbilly outﬁt and
carrying his jug, in public.

Other tactics employed by the
Panther include the ﬂying of
wooden airplanes hither and yon
around the stadium bearing prohi-
bitionist mottoes. This practice
was immediately taken up by
eager students anxious to see the
return of prohibition.

An explanation of the reasons

for taking this somewhat alarm-
ing stand is expected to show up
in this election issue of the Pan-
ther, which by the way is still 25
cents.

When editor John Schnapp was
questioned as to the actual con-
tents of his latest gift to the lit-
erary life of the University, he
only leaned way back in his swivel
chair, closed one eye, joined
thumb and index ﬁnger of his left
hand, and announced solemnly:
“This is it, brother. This is it.”

Further questioning of Schnapp
failed to reveal any more of the
magazine’s content.

“I can promise you you will
have ads,” Schnapp did disclose.

Meanwhile, circulation manager
Ray Maher has announced the
circulation departments latest
brainstorm to boost further the
circulation. Letters have been sent
the various sororities and the PIA
to get their girls to enter a con-
test to helpiin a circulation drive.

The girls are to serve as sales-
women, and their applications
should be in the Panther office,
828 C, C1, by tomorrow. Included
on the application should be a
schedule of the student’s free
hours. The sorority which sells the
most Panthers each issue will
have as a prize, a writeup in the
following issue of the magazine.
The contest begins with this new
issue of the magazine.

Other organizations desiring to
participate may do so by contact-
ing the Panther ofﬁce. .

Rushees Note
Silence Week

Fraternity ﬂsilence got into full .

swing today as freshmen began
receiving invitations from the
Dean of Men’s office to join cam-
pus fraternities.

Invitations are being sent to all
freshmen who have been bidded
on at the Dean’s office by the va-
rious fraternities.

During the b i d d i n g period,
which continues until" next Mon-
day, all fraternities must observe
a week of silence in which they
are not permitted to approach any
beginning freshman.

The week of silence is intended
to give freshmen a chance to de-
cide which fraternity, if any, they
will, join. If a rushee decides to
joina fraternity, he must make

his choice known to the office of
the Dean of Men by Monday.

If a rushee does not accept a fra-
ternity bid within the silence pe-
riod‘, he cannot do so until Jan.
3, 1949.

World Federalist President
Speaks Here Tomorrow Niighi

United World Federalists President Cord Meyer Jr._will speal
for peace and world law in Carnegie Music Hall at 8:15 p. m. to

morrow.

Student tickets for his talk are
selling for 65 cents in the ‘YMCA
office on the twelfth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral.

“World War III or World Law”
warns the speech title. Meyer will
try to prove his claim with spok-
en sentences that Life magazine
says are well-placed, syntactic-
ally correct, and better than the
written sentences of most other
people.

Two years ago, says Meyer,
people told him that world fed-
eration was a good idea but im-
practical until sometime far into
the future. Today people complain
that the idea is impossible be-
cause war with Russia is inevita-
ble. Part of Meyer’s answer to this
is embodied in the title of his
speech, the_rest in the speech it-
self.

Meyer was appointed president
of the Federalists in May, 1947,
when ﬁve organizations dedicated
to establishment of world govern-

ment merged. His education in
cluded schooling in Switzerlam
a major in philosophy and litera
ture at Yale, and a study of la‘

and a graduate year as a Lowe
Fellow at Harvard.
