Bush is Cl success, despite the bad weather

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

The organizers of Saturday’s Bigelow
Bash faced a nasty April Fool’s joke from
Mother Nature.

The festive mood of the bash was some-
what dampened by snow ﬂurries and drizzle
throughout the course of the day. Rain forced
the event to shut down early before the ﬁnal
musical act —— The Clarks —— could ﬁnish its
set.

Despite the weather, a large crowd of stu-
dents gathered on Bigelow Boulevard to eat,
listen to music and goof off.

“The weather didn’t cooperate like we
wanted, but we have a great crowd, and
that’s all that matters,” said Christina Bell,
director of special events for Pitt Program
Council.

Performances by comedians Mark Eddie
and Frank Nicotero and musical groups

University of Pittsburgh

Brownie Mary and The Flow Band high-
lighted the street festival.

Booths and games in which students could
participate free of charge lined the street.

Among other things, students could dress
up in Civil War garb and get an antique
photo taken, get temporary tattoos painted
on their bodies or have their caricatures
drawn by artist Dave DeLano.

The Resident Student Association spon-
sored a number_of games for students includ-
ing a virtual reality booth and a sumo
wrestling game. Also available was an

American Gladiators-type jousting game and ‘

a human-bowling game which involved sit-
ting inside a huge metal ball and rolling
down the street to knock down ﬁve-foot-tall
bowling pins.

Roving entertainment consisted of "a
mime, a magician and a talking robot named
Punchy. . .

A demonstration by professional glass

blower Mark Haller was also featured.
Haller took melted glass from his 2,000
degree furnace and shaped it into a water
pitcher before students’ eyes.

Clothing and accessories were on sale at
discounted prices during the bash. The Pitt
Shop offered sweatshirts, tees and other Pitt
clothing for 20 percent off. Tela Ropa sold
everything from wool sweaters to exotic oils
to wallets at its table.

“Everything is on sale,” said Mark
Dunbacher of Tela Ropa. “Some stuff a lot,
and some a little.’7

A food tent run by

offered hotdogs, hamburgers, salads and
other foods to students. '

Bell said she considered the bash a suc-
cess.

“lt’s going great,” she said. “People are out
having fun, and that’s all we wanted. Our
main purpose is for students to go out and
have an awesome time at a very low cost.”

Members of Pitt’s Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian. Alliance
(BiGALA) held elections for
seven steering committee posi-
‘tions and discussed plans for next
year at their meeting Wednesday.

Until this semester, the group
has always had two co-presidents
who have held most of the deci-
sion-making power. Members said
the new structure will ensure that
responsibilities are equally divided
and that all members have input
into the decision—rnaking process.

The steering committee will
now consist of historian, social,
publicity, education, health, busi-
ness and liaison chairs. The com-
mittee will reach decisions by con-
sensus and then present its find-

ings to the whole group for feed-
back. -

“Hopefully there will be more

participation between the mem-
bers,”. said Katie Douglass,
BiGALA member and new edu-
cation chair. “This is the ﬁrst time
we’ve changed our format,
changed our organization, and we
might be a little anxious about
how things are going to work out,
but we hope [the changes] will be
beneﬁcial.”

Members said they now want to

move the focus from restructuring"

to other issues.
“We spent a lot of energy reor-
ganizing, so whatever people had

‘on their minds to get done this

semester probably didn’t really get
done,” said Fred Bigelow, the new
publicity chair.

Bigelow said he wants the orga-

nizationto become more visible
on campus and to expand mem-
bership. According to Douglass,
there are cunently 80 to 100 mem-
bers but attendance at meetings is
usually much smaller.
. Douglass said she plans to have
more speakers at meetings,
expand counseling resources for
members and organize lectures on
safe sex.

“Next year I think we are really

going to try torevamp our fresh-‘

man education and try and get
more people to talk to freshman
studies classes about the issues of
queer people,” said Douglass.

The group also held an all—day
safer sex workshop for lesbian,
gay and bisexual students
Saturday. The workshop was
sponsored by the Persad Center,
an outpatient mental heath center.

Bauman and a candy dipping
demonstration by Ron
Kotcho of Betsy Ann
Chocolates.

Another highlight of the
scrumptious sale was

Chocolate Challenge ‘95, a
competition which allowed
both professional and ama-
teur chocolatiers to strut
their stuff. Chefs from area
bakeries, caterers and clubs,
as well as experienced *“at-

home chocolate concocters,”'

entered the contest, using
either traditionalor original
recipes. E
According to Jean Rock,
chair of the association, six

separate categories were set
up to ensure fairness. “We

.couldn’t have a piece of

chocolate candy competing
against a chocolate fedora

. cake, they’re just too differ-

ent, so we broke it down.”

A large table displayed the
contestants’ tantalizing‘
masterpieces for most of
the day before the judges
performed their painstaking
duty of tasting each submis-
sion.

First place winners in each
category were: caterers,
Patricia Finnerty for
Strawberry Tuxedo; bak-
eries, .B.unznudders for

French Cheesecake; candy

from restaurants, Keith
Bauman for Chocolate
Mocha Truffles; clubs, Ken
Mulph of the Twentieth

Chocolate Cake and choco-
late candy, Yetters Candy of
Millvale.

“It was tough to distin-
guish between exceptional
and exceptional,” said judge
Dick Howe. “They were all
delicious and it was a really
tough job having to taste
delicious -dessert after deli-
cious dessert, but hey, some-

body had to do it.”

The festival was held in
the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room.

The Pitt News
Monday, April 3, 1995
Smaller budget
Money for education is becoming scarce, and the University ,
of Pittsburgh is by no means immune to the belt—trghten1ng gag _
®

going on all over the country. Pitt is facing a hiring freeze for
three years, a tuition increase and a cut in funds from the State.

-What does this mean for Pitt students? Ideally, it should mean

nothing at all.

If Pitt raises its tuition more than 4.5 percent next fall, it
would not receive an increase in its current appropriation.
University Officials were planning on a 6 percent increase in
state funding. '

Chancellor O’Connor wants to hold tuition increases to 3.5
percent to manage this, but according to the-Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, this could still leave Pitt $8 million short of what it was
expecting.

The hiring freeze comes in response to a $5.7 million shortfall
in this fiscal year. The freeze will last until June 30, the end of
the current fiscal year.

The change in University Health plans was also cited as a
cost-cutting measure. Yet, in all of this, there is little talk about
the University’s continuing ability to provide a quality education
for its students. The University of Pittsburgh is not a for-proﬁt
business. It is here to provide a service. In looking at cost-cut-
ting measures, perhaps cutting $400,000 salaries should be con-
sidered. Don’t place the deficit on the back of the university’s
students.

Bigger bash

Saturday, as many of you know, was the Bigelow Bash, that
awesome alliterative aggregationof Pitt students together with
food, fun and music, according to the ads and some of the people
who went. Despite some unpleasant weather, students still showed
up in force to enjoy all the day’s events.

While the Bash itself was a good idea and success among
those who came, the organizers should plan for bigger, better
Bashes in the future. A week-long event, like other colleges’
“Senior Weeks” and “Spring Flings,” would be more in order.
Although alliteration may be lost, since commandeering Bigelow
Boulevard for a week would be impractical, nonetheless a “Pitt
Pow-wow” staged on the Cathedral lawn would add to the effect
of the Bash.

Expanding it to a full week would allow more students to take
part. A free festival nvolving local bands and local talents allows
Pitt students to blow off some steam and prepare for the end-of-
the—term crunch which weighs so heavily on their minds. Sure,
there is the nightlife of Pittsburgh and Oakland, but not everyone
takes advantage of it, nor does everyone want to take part. Some
people would actually prefer pounding each other with giant cot-
ton swabs as opposed to hanging out at Zelda’s.

Also, by expanding it to a full week, more students could find
time to participate and spread news of the event by word of mouth.
When looking to next year, the Bash organizers should look to the
capacious Cathedral lawn and plan for a bigger, better Bash.

Schools need a global focus on history

 orthepast
. several
months,

controversy has
been brewing
over what histo-
ry to teach our
children. Late
last year, the

 

Columnist
Tony
Dickensheets UCLA Centfir
for History in
the Schools released its study
entitled “National Standards
for World History: Exploring

Paths ‘ to the Present.”
Unfortunately, like most
debates that become entangled
with politics, thus far it has
been dominated by extremists
on both sides of the political
spectrum.

As somebody with an
International Studies back-
ground, I find myself agreeing
with those who assert that
with the interdependence of
today’s world, it is imperative
for our students to be intro-
duced to all of the world’s
great civilizations, not just to
that of the Western world. The
standards that UCLA has sug-

gested seem to be appropriate.

Among their suggestions for
Middle Eastern,

MesoAmerican, and Eastern
civilizations are for students
to study and discuss the
Olmec civilization, the
Mauryan Empire of India, the
unification of China and the
importance of the Silk Road to
trade between Asia and the
Middle East.

The drafters of these recom-
mendations have assured con-
servatives that students would
not be shortchanged on learn-
ing about Western civilization.
In this area they study Greek
civilization, the Roman
Empire, the Magna Carta and
its relationship to the rule of
law and the English legal sys-
tem.

‘In an increasingly intercon-
nected global community, it
seems reasonable to expect
our_citizens to understand not
only our country, but the
world as a whole. The prob-
lem, however, begins when

politics become entangled in
the educational system. Many
Americansfcertainly not all of
them conservatives, are con-
cerned that the pendulum may
be swinging too far to the
Left. While many people seem
willing to admit that most
school history courses focus
on Western civilization, it is
quite another task entirely to
get them to understand the
importance of educating our
children about the entire
world.

Most of them that know of
the world economy and the
increasing interaction of the
US with the world, fear, not
celebrate, this phenomenon. In
addition, like the conserva-
tives, they worry that the new
curriculum will not allow
enough time for students to
develop a firm grasp of
American civilization or that
its history will be distorted by
radicals on the Left. One need
only look at our college cam-
puses to see that many of their
worries are not unfounded.

On many college campuses
during the 1980s, the history
pendulum clearly did swing
too far to the Left. Instead of
taking Western civilization
classes, many universities
required freshmen to take
“third world studies” courses
that focused mostly on
“oppressed peoples.” Many of
those Western civilization
courses that are offered now
seem to take on a Marxist tone
that depicts European males as
little more than slave buyers
and conquerors of “peace—lov-
ing” peoples. This is one of
the reasons for the controversy
over Christopher Columbus’
birthday several years ago. To
ignore the cultural achieve-
ments of Europe while por-
traying it as a continent of sal-
vage imperialists is not only
revisionist history, it is a lie.

America’s public school
system cannot allow political-
ly correct multicultural advo-
cates to take the lead in this
debate. That would only
ensure that our students will

remain ignorant not only of
world history, but of
American history as well. In
addition, this type of rhetoric
can only lead to the further
balkanization of American
society in the 1990s. It also
encourages tribalism among
the many diverse ethnic and
racial groups that make up our
nation.

I suggest that we try to.

reach a middle ground on this
issue. In my opinion, there is
too much political rhetoric
and historical misrepresenta-
tion on both sides of this
issue. A distorted example
from each side illustrates my
point. On the Right, there is
the way that the Greek city-
states are pictured. While it is
true that many of our democ-
ratic principals can be traced
back to Athens, it’s a myth to
say that Athens had a democ-
ratic system of government.
After all, only an aristocratic
class of males could vote and
slavery was an accepted way
of life. On the Left, there is
the nonsense that slavery was
first used by the West, namely
the Portuguese trading system
with Africa. Not only does
this completely ignore the
African practice of slavery,
but also the fact that slavery

has existed throughout history.

This is how the pyramids in
Giza Egypt and the Great Wall
in China were built.

There is no doubt that our
schools must begin to take a
more balanced approach to
teaching world history. The
nature of the world in the 21st
century will demand it. But,
the revision of the curriculum
must include the fact that
America was, currently is, and
always will be a nation based
on Western civilization. On
the other hand, children
should be taught about other
cultures and learn to respect
them. This is how a manage-
able compromise can be
reached.

nist for The Pitt News.

tee couldn’t

__ up better if
V - they tried.

glglgmnist The two
most talent-

Duncan ed teams
will finally

battle it out for the national
crown. ,

UCLA’s golden history vs.
the defending champ
Arkansas. The Bruins
haven’t been to the champi-
onship game since l980. The
Razorbacks have made the
Final Four three out of five ,
years. UCLA entered the
tournament No. 1, while
Arkansas won the most
games during the regular
season.

Any way you dissect this
game, it’s the same common
denominator — it’s clearly '
the colossal matchup of the
year.

Both point guards hold the
key to their team’s high-
octane attack. Arkansas’
Corey Beck is a ﬂat-out
defensive whiz. He’s the
leader of coach Nolan
Richardson’s 40 minutes of
hell defensive scheme. Beck,
who has mastered the art of
hand-checking, will certainly
need that craft when he goes
against Tyus Edney. _

1 No one in college has yet
to match Edney’s quickness.
The tiny 5-foot-10 spark

plug has been unstoppable in _

the toumament so far, evi-
dent by winning the West
regional Most Valuable
Player. The key to this
matchup is if the game is
officiated closely, then'Beck
could be in foul trouble the
whole game, giving UCLA

' the definite advantage.

‘ No one in college is more
clutch than Arkansas’ Scotty
Thurman. The 6-7 swing-
man’s three-pointer with the
shot clock dwindling down
sealed the national title last
year against Duke.
Thurman’s the man who
wants the ball in the closing
seconds to take that critical
shot. Every championship
caliber team needs one of
these guys, and Arkansas has
him. ‘

UCLA will probably rotate
Charles O’Bannon and fresh-
man Tobey‘Baile'y to stick
Thurman. Neither match
Thurman’s height, but both
are very athletic.

Pitt slides pst SJ, sees ween

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer

The downward spiral of
the Pitt baseball team is
over

The Panthers improved
their home record to 10-0
with a three-game sweep
over highly-respected St.
John’s this weekend, ending 1
a five-game_skid.

The sweep improved Pitt’s
record to 19-7, while
evening its Big East record
to 3-3.

“We got the monkey off
our backs,” said Mike
Rohrbach, who had the
game-winning h-it in a
thrilling 5-4 victory during
yesterday’s game.

Starting pitcher Gregg
Mrochko went thedistance
yesterday, allowing only five
hits and three earned runs,
while raising his record to 5-
1.

With the Panthers trailing
4-3 in the bottom of the
sixth inning, Jon
DeBernardis stepped up to
the plate with runners on
first and second and nobody
out. DeBernardis, who went
0-4, struck out. Then Tyler
Shantz grounded into an
inning-ending double play.

Things remained dormant

pitch,”

at Trees Field until Panther

rightfielder Josh Mellor

went to bat in the bottom of
the eighth. With_the bases
empty, Mellor sent a pitch
by starting St. John’s pitcher
Mike Maerten over the right-
center field wall to knot the

_’ score at 4-4.

“I was looking for iﬁy
Mellor V said.
“Maerten was working me
over with curveballs amnd I
was just sitting on the fast-
ball.”

After Mellor’s first home
run of the season,

the ninth inning with the
score still tied at 4.

Jeff Murse led off the bot-
tom of the ninth with a walk

the ‘
‘Panthers came to the plate in

and then was replaced by
pinch—runner R.J. McCarthy.
Rohrbach went to the box to
face Maerten.

“I love being in that situa-
tion,” Rohrbach said of
pinch-hitting.

Maerten proceeded to run
the count full on Rohrbach. _

“When the count got to 3-
2, I knew he’d probably
throw a fastball,” Rohrbach
said. “I just went for it.”

. Rohrbach ripped a line

drive over the St. John’s’

shortstop and when center-
fielder Matthew Mushorn
failed to ‘field the ball»clean-
ly, McCarth-y scored from
first.

For the game, Pitt scored
five runs on seven hits while

committing two errors. The
Red Flash scored four runs
on five hits and committed a

' costly four errors.

Pitt’s weekend started on
Saturday with a doublehead-
er. -

The Panthers scored five
runs on seven hits in a 5-2
victory in the first game.

Starting pitcher Tedde
Campbell raised his record
to 7-1 after pitching his
fourth complete game of the
year .

Catcher Jeff Montgomery
went 2-for-3, including his
second home run of "the year.
Jason Conti continued his
torrid hitting pace as he
drove in three runs. Conti is
batting .500 (10-'20) in Big

East play and leads Pitt with
a .374 average.

Pitt broke out the lumber
in the second game of the
doubleheader, scoring 11

"runs on 10 hits while hold-

ing St. John’s to nine hits in
a 11-4 victory. ‘

Conti led the way, going 4-
for-4, scoring four and dri-
ving in one run. Rob Garvey
nailed a three-run homer and
Ed Shaffer" drove in two
runs. The Panthers ‘added
four unearned runs off five
St. John’s errors.

Starting pitcher Rohrbach
raised his record to 3-2
after pitching the first
five innings. Reliever Chris
Bean finished the game,

Lacrosse team finishes 2-2ot Pitt Shootout

By Jer1'y Klayman ~
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team continued
their season of overachieving this past
weekend as they won two games in the
fifth armual Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout.
The tournament was typical of the team’s
play so far as Pitt ﬁnished with a record of
2-2.

The team came out with a lot of intensity
in their first game against Penn State on

Friday evening. The Panthers’ offense

played extremely well, finding the back of
Nittany Lions’ net 10 times. Meanwhile, on
the other side of the ball, the Panthers’ suf-
focating defense combined together with
superb goaltending from Division III trans-
fer Michael Stuckert landed the Panthers
their first shutout of the season.

_ “The first game against Penn State was a
really good one for -the team,” said Dave

Walter. “We played with a lot of intensity.
Everyone had their heads in the _game. We
really did not make many fundamental mis-
takes. We caught and threw the ball well.”

Moving along in the winners’ bracket of
the tournament, the Panthers’ next oppo-
nent on Saturday afternoon was Freedonia.
Pitt once again came out focused by build-
ing an early lead. It appeared that the
Panthers were cruising until Freedonia
mustered up a comeback and eventually
tied the game on a late goal, sending it to a
sudden death ﬁfteen-minute overtime peri-
od. Although allowing Freedonia to come
back into the game, the Panthers held their
composure in the overtime period. The
most exciting goal of the toumament was
off the stick of senior Rory Connaughton
for the game-winner.

“The Freedonia game was extremely
exciting and extremely intense,” said sopo-
homore Peter O’Hara. “It seemed like we

ran‘ out of gas at the end.”

The Panthers’ next opponents were the
Wolverines from Michigan. Holding their
own throughout the game, the Panthers fell
7-5. The defeat was also the second loss
ever at the Cost Center.

“For the most part, the team played.

well,” said O’Hara. “We just came up
short.” ' "

Playing now in the losers’ bracket,
Sunday’s ﬁnal opponent was Brockport. At
stake was the losers’ bracket championship.
The Panthers, fatigued and lacking touma-
ment experience, succombed in a hard-
fought battle which also needed an extra
period to be decided.

With playoffs approaching in the near
future, the Panthers must win their next
three games to be a part of it. Their next
game will be against Carnegie Mellon, fol-
lowed by Slippery Rock. West Virginia
closes out the season.
