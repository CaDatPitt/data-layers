» Schmitt is a petitioner for a
Congress’ post, the — one on the,
slate not placed on the ‘ballot, by
‘the senior nominating committee
a week ago Tuesday. An Ellsworth
Center candidate, he is expected

. by the political action committee

to draw Center support to the

. independent allignment.

Men will vote April 20.
Joint support of the eight-man

I , panel iwas achieved Tuesday
through emergency meetings of

the executive boards of the two
campus organizations. . _

Although a promise of some 200
votes was _made, the coalition
failed‘ to gain complete support
The re-
port from the Center was that the
field is wide open, with some ten

 * men circulating petitions for Con-

. gress berths. ~

The 200 votes are expected__t
come from backers of Schmitt,, a
Men’s Council member this year.

Last Year’s 'Attempt

An informal campaign last year
by the then infant PIA failed to
stem the fraternity political pow-
er. Ellsworth Center showed its
influence by pushing Ed Zadaroz-
ny, the only man to crack IF’s
slate. _

Engineering and ‘Mines Asso-
ciation was not active as a group
in the ’48 campaign.

The original report stated that Student Congress slioulcl. ’

licizing the present academic ad-
vising program and -‘new facilities
which ‘may be established.

Not Full‘ Responsibility

The deans decided that Con-
gress should not assume the full
responsibility, but should cooper-
ate on publicity. -

Under ‘fsuggested addenda to
the departmental advisory sys-
tem” the report provided that en-
tering "freshmen who have an. in-
tended major department be as-
signed to an advisor in their de-
partment- _

' Freshmen who have not decided
on a major would be assigned to a
general advisor.

The deans disagreed with this
provision because, as Dean Biddle
put it, “It has never been our pol-
icy to wet—nurse the students.”

Dean’s Stand

Dean Biddle further explained
the deans’ stand by- saying, “We
feel it is part of growing up to
assume responsibility for your
own welfare.” He said that they
were prepared to “throw open
the deans” doors.” '

Miss Westerman, who completed
the ‘report with the aid of Dr.
Roger W. Russel of the Psychology
Department, was congratulated by
Dean Crawford and her colleagues
in Student Congress.. '

Dean Crawford has already, be-
gun work on the program.

entirelyby instructors in the Elec-
trical Engineering. Department for
use in a new course, “Fundamen-
tals of Radioand Television.”

This is the ﬁrst television set to

» be built anywhere in the Univer-

scribes it as “a better’ set,with a
ten-inch focus, which gets very
good reception.” It took , about

. two weeks to build.

The new course will begin in
the summer session, and includes
the assembling and testing of both
radio and television sets. Mr. John
Brinda will be the instructor for
the course, which will.include two
lectures and a three-hour lab each
week. '

Council Petitions Due Today.
Over 100 Men Seek Office

' Today is the last day that the Nominating Committee of_Men’s
Council is accepting petitions for ballot positions at the April 20
4 elections. 
“Over 100 petitions have been received sofar,” announced Jim

: Madden, member of the nominat-9

ing committee. I
Fifteen positions are open. As
only four names are put ‘up for

each position, » the nominating ~

committee, which is made up of
the senior members of Men’s
Council,‘ is in the process of elim-
inating approximately 50 candi-
dates. _ .«

The eliminations are based upon
the signatures on the petitions.
Each candidate must have a qual-

'ity point average of atlleast 1.2

and some previous experience in

"school activities.

The candidates will. also be

selected to give proportionate
representation to the various
schools. '

Men’s elections will be_conduc-
ted by paper ballot this year in-
stead of by voting machine, the
procedure used last year.

Members of each school will re-

ceive £1 ballot listing_ the names"

candidates from their own partic-
ular school for Men’s Council.

Editor McCormack was asked
about his refusal to serve on the
committee. He said that the pres-
ent system, where publicity chair-
men bring their material to him,
was sufﬁcient, and that the editor
of the News “couldn’t add any-
thing to. the committee.”

Tom Ryan then gave, an ex-
ample where he thought the editor
would be an aid. “In the case of
a ‘green’ publicity chairman,” he-
said, “the editor of the News
could help him plan his whole
publicity campaign.” '

McCormack explained that the '

News editor is not necessarily a
publicity expert. “In fact,” ‘ he
said, “the editors of the Owl and
the Panther would probably know
more about publicity than I do,
for they have to use it.” .

Another objection voiced by
McCormack was that if the were
on the committee he would not
be free to criticize.

Ryan made the statement that‘
“since the Pitt News is a very in-
tegral part of publicity, the, editor
or his representative should be a
member of the committee.

At this point. Sam Simpson
moved that the publicity report
be amended to strike out the‘

phrase “the editor or his repre- ’

sentative.” r
Bob Kingsley said that if the

I

editor'of the Pitt‘News were ex- V"

cluded, the committee name might
as well be changed to “poster
committee”’or something like that.
The motion was defeated by a’
vote of six to three. ‘ '

The report was tabled on Na 0

motion from Ryan. It will be ta-
ken up by the-publicity commit-
tee and rewritten if necessary.

Ryan Resigns
From Congress

Tom Ryan, -advocate of beer at,

University functions and chairman 7 ‘

of the Polltcommittee, resigned
from Student Congress Tuesday.

The senior Congress member
named a heavy scholastic sched-

ule and “press of other‘ personal / ‘
obligations” as his reasons for re-"~ ’

signing. .

He will continue as Poll Com-I

mittee chairman until the end of

Nuclear Physics to Produce .4 -Bomb

By R. L. ROSSEL

In the small colosseum house"

“on the hill,” next to Western
State Psychiatric Institute, there
is still as much news as there was
two years‘ ago when Pittsburgh’s
ﬁrst cyclotron moved into the na-
tion’s headlines. Today research is
still going on in “the cYC10t1‘0n
building,’’‘ and the most recent
news from the atomic project lab
announces the beginning of what
will be a new underground labora-
tory, to be completed as soon as
possible.

At present, the radiation labora-
tory, located on O’Hara Street just
below Western Pennsylvania Psy-

chiatric Institute,,is under the di- .

rection of Dr. Alexander J. Allen,
Westinghouse Graduate Professor
of Engineering. 4

“During the war we knew
enough about nuclear physics to
produce the atomic bomb, but as
yet we know nothing of the forces
which hold these forces,” says Dr.
Allen. “Since fundamental re-
search ﬁrst began on nuclear
phyics in 1890, we have develop-
ed the atomic bomb. But it will
take more fundamental research
in the future to develop other
forces which will be useful rather
than destructive to man,” Dr. Al-
len added. '

The cyclotron on the Pitt cam-
pus is the fourth largest in the
world, This huge one—hundred ton
magnet has eighteen miles of cop-
per ribbon wrapped around its
pole to receive power for the en-
ergizing of the magnet. ‘

Steve Pavlakovic Goes All Out
To Hold onto Third Base Job

Charles Lamb, the eminent English essayist, once asked
for a lady ’s hand with the words, “Madam, my liver and for-
itune are entirely at your disposal.” So, too, would Steve Pav-
lakovic give almost anything for a position on Ralph Mitter-
ling’s baseball team.

Although Pavlakovic, a 21-year-old phys ed major, hopes
to keep his glands, he has shown a willingness to go all out in
an effort to nab a job with the mittmen this year.

tions made from a crystal ball. He
has played with or against many

Pair of Sluggers
Report to 'Sorge'

The oﬁensive hopes of Ralph
Mitterling were bolstered consid-
erably this week with the initial
appearances of Big Jim Couch and
Art Barnes at spring‘ training.
Both were the. batting twins of
Mitter1ing’s 1948 baseball edition.

The return of Barnes and Couch
provides the Sarge withhis only
.300 hitters. Couch _ﬁnished the
season last year with a ‘.361 aver-
age. Barnes came through with
a respectable .306.

The two sluggers, however, will
have plenty of competition from
newcomers to the Mitterling fold
this year. They were given ‘per-
mission by Mitterling to hold late
batting practices in an eﬁort to.

raise their timing on a level with _

the rest of the players.

THIS WAS DAVE 0’LOUGHLIN, Pitt tennis coach, when he

was battling at the top of the tennis heap a decade ago. He recom-

mends tennis as a sport that can

be pursued even after one is no

longer a youth. To prove the point, he still engages some of the
nation’s best amateurs when they are in Pittsburgh.

The teams will be divided into. four or possibly ﬁve leagues.

“I mean these truck drivers who
drive past a tennis court and yell
‘40-Love’ in a jeering voice. They
wouldn’t last three minutes in a
fast’ game of tennis,” says the

' veteran coach.

1‘ Dr. O’Loughlin has V coached
Panther net teams for 18, years,
second only to Dr. H. C. Carlson
in length of service when it comes
to coaching a varsity sport at Pitt.
Was Pitt Grad . .
,The net mentor graduated from

,the University medical "school in
" 1930. While in the College, he

was a mainstay on the Pitt tennis
team. ‘

“One thing about playing ten-
nis in college,” says Dr. O’Lough-
lin, “is that you can keep on
playing it when your college days
are over. In many of the major

‘ sports that isn’t true.”

Can Treat Cockiness

If any of his boys should ever
become cocky over their tennis
abilities, Coach O’Loughlin needs
only to step on the court himself
to bring them down to earth.

He won the Western Pennsyl-
vania tennis championship last
year for the ﬁfth time. His ﬁrst
West Penn title came in 19-25,,
While in 1922, he won the national
boy’s ‘championship. '

With _the expansion of the ath— '
, letic facilities at Pitt, Dr. O’Lough-
lin feels that tennis will take on .

a more important aspect. He is
pleased with this development for
he believes that tennis, like all

other sports,’is good for the par- '

ticipants and the University.

Cassiano Cusses
News; Bad Press
May Be Resulf

There is a deﬁnite fear that the
recent appointment of Dick Cas-
siano, ex-football coach, to a posi-
tion in the Dean of Men’s oﬁice
will result in bad press relations
for that department.

On learning of Cassiano’s ap-
pointment, the News sent him a
letter of condolence, informing
him of the annual autumn drub-
bing which the Dean’s staff takes
in touch football at the hands of
the News staff. ‘ .

‘‘It is a shame that you could
not have wound up your playing
career in a blaze of glory,” said
the letter to Cassiano.

In reply, the new assistant dean
wrote:

“You have unwittingly aided
the athletic cause of the Assistant
Deans of Men. Your inﬂammatory
letter, will be used as a psycho-
logical torch to inspire our team’s
efforts during the game.’

“Rest assured that preparations
are now being advanced to pro-

vide the means necessary for our’

victory. Gentlemen, and I use the
term advisedly, gird yourloinsl”

The frats will compose two eight’

team leagues. There will be, a ten
team Engineering ‘league, and an
eight-team Professional school
league. ,
