HEW Grant

For Twelve

The United States Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
has granted $201,645 for scholar-

_ships in Sanitary Engineering for
a new program being formulated
by Dr. John M. Nutt, associate
professor of Civil Engineering.

The grant will be allotted over
a ﬁve year period, beginning next
month, and the stipends probably
will be divided among twelve
students. '

According to Dr. Nutt, a num-
ber of new courses will be esta-
blished at the>University to de-
velop a full-time, graduate study
program in water resources. 1

“Sources of water, beneficial
uses of water, quality control and
water planning and administra-
tion will be some of our areas of
study,” he said.

“Pittsburgh certainly has its
water and sanitation problems,
especially in the Monongahela
and Allegheny Rivers,” Dr. Nutt
observed. “We will concentrate
on these matters first, but we
eventially hope to be dealing
with similar problems in foreign
countries as well.”

“Our ﬁrst objectives will be to
locate graduate enginers or people
already in the ﬁeld interested in

the program, to establish the
courses and to develop the fac-
ulty,” he added.

LIBRARY HOURS

Library hours for the July
4th weekend will be as fol-
lows: July 4 —- closed; July
5 —- 8 a.m. to 5,p.m.; July 6
— 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; and
July 7 — closed.

 

   

‘Billions in Space
Soothe U.S. Pride’ 5

We are spending 30 billion dollars in space annually, ac-
cording to Dr. Vernon Van Dyke, primarily to feed our na-
tional pride. “In things that matter to us,” Van Dyke explain-
ed at Midday Series last Wednesday, “we can’t stand being
second, let alone being second rate.”

Van Dyke, now on leave from the University of Iowa
where he is chairman of the Political Science Department, is

currently writing a book on the rationale of our space.

program. - I

The people of the world respect
achievement,‘ and the Russians
are achieving, Van Dyke echoed
President Kennedy. “The life of
the contented cow is not for us,”
he added. We seek leadership in
space mainly because we do not
like to be the butt of humiliating
jokes; we don’t appreciate having
the Russians mockingly gloat over
their superior achievements.

Despite theprotests of critics
who lament the outlay of bil-
lions of dollars on an “adoles-
cent desire,” Van Dyke feels the
national pride is worth the.ex-
pense. .

There is no other real justi-
ﬁcation for our lunar program,
according to Van Dyke. The
other beneﬁts usually cited —
military security, co - operation
for peace science and technical
progress, and commercial “spin-
off” — could be achieved just
as easily, and much less expen-
sively, by our terrestial, or
near-space, program.

Even many natural scientists
criticize the expense of talent and
money on the unnecessary lunar
project, Van Dyke revealed.‘ Not
only does it drain the limited
supply of talent from other ne-
glected, but equally important
sciences, but it -also drains money
from other valuable projects, they

Chancellor Urges

New Renaissance

Panther Hollow Project Expected
To Help Pittsburgh’s Plight

By NANCY DELANEY
“We need a new chapter in the Renaissance of Pitts-

burgh,” announced Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld last,

Tuesday on KDKA television and radio’s program, “Focal
Point Pittsburgh.” Pittsburgh’s" economic problem is one of
total social development, the Chancellor asserted: “We don’t
have the things that attract people.

Projects such as Oakland Corporation’s research park,
partially sponsored by the University, will attract people,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, claimed on the hour-and-a‘-half

long program sponsored by KDKA°
‘ as part of the ,kick-off for its
~year-long examination of Pitts-

burgh’s economic problems and

’ future.

The proximity‘ of laboratories,
libraries, and theoretical techni-

. cians will draw\“spin-off’? indus--
. tries to the Pittsburgh area once
‘ the Panther Hollow park is com-
. plete,

according to Litchﬁeld.
Oakland will serve as a coupling

between the “hardware” and the
, theoretical areas of industry.

‘Archaic’ Local Government '

Industry, the Chancellor feels,
goes where engineering and sci-
entiﬁc talent are. Vocational
training is only a very small part
of the problem. In order to at-
tract industry and talent, Pitts-
burgh needs developments in edu-
cation, culture and politics.

The system of local govern-
ment in Western Pennsylvania
was particularly described by
Litchﬁeld as ‘,‘archaic” and “25
years behind what progressive
people are doing.” As for edu-
cation, you get back what you
invest, the -Chancellor remark-
‘ed, noting that other areas are
investing twice as much per
capita income in education‘ as
Pittsburgh. A

In answer, however, to the
charge of author Philip Wylie,

For Spring ;

Making the Spring trimester
comparatively crowded this year

The happy smiles on the faces
of coeds are understandable.

- Assis tame Required

Living in the residence .,halls are anumber of wheel-

chair ridden students —— both male and female — who re- -

quire some special attention from the University even
though the students themselves state that they can do most
everything on their own.

However, when rising in the morning is a two hour
project and, in some bases, is almost impossible without as-
sistance, then it is the obligation of the University to pro-
vide aid for these students.

Some help was extended when the University built the
special wheel-chair ramp into the SU, but the students have
since been evicted from theibuilding and now all the ramp
serves is to admit them to the cafeteria which will go out
of operation in September.

The state also allocates a certain amount each year for
the care of these students, but it is not enough to provide

‘the full assistance which they require when in their .
' rooms. '

It would be a ﬁne gesture on the part of the Univer-
sity to allocate enough money so that one or two full-time
resident nurses could be hired to assist the students in their
daily routines.

Summer Ami Sweat

The summer is aimiserable season for any student un-
lucky enough to be caught living in the dorms with their
complete lack of air-conditioners, fans, and fresh air.

Sleeping becomes.drudgery, bathing a useless exercise

, resulting in torrents of sweat upon leaving the bathroom,

and worst of all, studying is strictly impossible. No ‘self-
respecting student can concentrate on Plato or the third
rule of thermo—dynamics with huge drops of sweat drip-
ping from his ear lobes and his book constantly slipping
from his watery grasp. A

To apreciate the resident students’ condition, one would
have to don a fur coat and sit all afternoon in a corrugated
iron shed in the middle of the Sahara desert.

The only half-decently comfortable place within easy

reach‘ of all resident students in'the SU cafeteria, and it ~
would be a wise and humane move on the part of the

University if arrangements were made to keep it open at
_all times so that students could use it to study and cool off
in during the rest of this term. .

When is a policeman not a policeman? Ap
parently when he’s an Allegheny County detec-
tive. In the eyes of county authorities, it seems,

county detectives haven’.t quite grown up enough

to take on the responsibilities» ~
of ‘‘real’’' law enforcers. '

By now, the issues involved‘ ‘
in the battle between ten Alle-
gheny County detectives and
their superiors have become so
confused and hazy that the
public doesn't know who to be- _
lieve, and the ‘situation is 
pretty. bad when people do not '
know if they can believe their
cops. '

Theseries of events is fairly _
clear. Ten county policemen conducted
authorized” raids on ten or so county gambling
centers. County officials at ﬁrst congratulated the
men, then retired to a position of non-committal,
then condemned the men completely. The detec-
tives countered with an ultimatum to the county
officials that the top brass on the police force
would have to be ﬁred or the members of the
force would reveal cer_tain damaging information
regarding police criminality.

  

H

un-

County commissioners,‘ of course, refused. You

just can‘t ﬁre every police captain because his

men want him'ﬁred. The «detectives, however,‘

seemed pretty sure that they really had damaging
information, and gave that impression to the pub-

lic. Attorney for the detectives, in ‘fact, pre-

sented a petition for a grand jury investigation.

The petition, however, was denied. 1 '

The Issues Are Uncertain , ,
These are the main events,’ but the underlying

issues, especially the charges and counter ‘charges

concerning police criminality, remain .as clear as
borscht.

There are a‘ few things, however, which are
crystal-clear. Ten off—duty_‘county detectives
raided ten centers of illegal gambling. All ten
raids were fruitful. The men have receivedino

reward, either in the form of extra pay or even

the thanks of the community. It doesn’t, appear
that they expected either.

pansion. Any student who has attended this school

next year’s tuition to spend
time contemplating’ the effect
the new libraries, dormitories,
and computers will have on this
Universit and its students.

First to be announced was the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration research center,
and all the redevelopment plans that were tacked
onto this announcement. The center was hailed by
city officials and,members of the University ad-
ministration as a heaven-se_nt gift that would
provide the needed lift to the run-down Pitts-
burgh area. The amount to be spent on this re-
search center was somewhere around 30_mil1ion
dollars, but no student really remembers the exact
price.

Panther Hollow Proiect

As the cylindrical dormitories neared comple-
tion, the Panther Hollow project was announced,
and the echoes of the praises it received are still
ringing in students’ ‘ears. It will make one giant
campus ofithe University and the college down
the street, and enable the scientiﬁc brains of both
campuses to be mingled together. In its basement
will be housed another computer. -

In the midst of all this redevelopment,'ﬁnan-
cial expenditure, and scientiﬁcprogress, one per-

 

son seems to have been left by the wayside. He .

is the person who spends weary hours in the
memorization of French verbs and contemplation

policemen were not exactly congratulated for

weren’t for the unauthorized

their service. One of the commissioners, in fact,
stated that raids of this type constitute danger
of the establishment of a police state. ‘

Just from theseevents come certain obvious

conclusions. First, a policeman ceases to be a‘;'

policeman when he takes off his uniform. Second,
police superiors and ofﬁcials of other law enforce- —
ment agencies in the county either did not know
about the gambling centers or were reluctant to
do anything about them. And third, in the eyes
of county oﬂicials, policemen in general are ap-
parently not capable of enforcing the law on
their own; they tmust be ordered around like a
bunch of‘ children without the ability" to use

their own discretion. . A 1

Justification Unfounded  . _

The commissioners justiﬁed their raid—endin”E
order by stating that the county police should be
responsible only for county property and that
gambling and vice raids should be leftup to local‘
police forces. If this was so and was explicitly
set forth when the county force was created, then’
perhaps the raids should’ not, have been con-.
ducted by county policemen. It must be remem-
bered, however, th,at_in many Allegheny County

townships, local police forces are barely largeyg;/"

enough to maintain even'ful1—time traﬂic vigil;
It seems painfully apparent, however, that the?‘
raids should have been ordered by someone,‘ but
weren’t. It also seems evident that perhaps the
strict division of police authority into designated

areas determined by political geography is an un- ' "

healthy policy. Finally, of cour'se',_ it does. not
seem right that a policeman’s duties endwhen he
takes his uniform off. Lawbreakers recognize no
work shifts. '

It is more dan'gerous,it would seem, for re--._

sponsible oiﬁcials to publically castigate l_a._w en-‘

forcers when they have actually performeda sex‘?-“:’! ,

‘The  Drum’

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Gunter Grass’ international bestseller, The Tin Drum (Pantheon Books, 589 pp., $6.95),
has been called the ﬁrst “Novel of the Absurd”. The descriptive phrase may or may not
have value, but the book does share certain elements with the Absurd drama school: bitter-
ness, paradox, comedy both barbed" and low, and a ganglia of raw truth throughout.

The central character (hero? anti—hero? protagonist? antagonist?) in this sprawling,
jagged novel is Oskar, who relates his story from the bed of a German mental hospital.

After a compelling introduction toO V
up society: religion, history, poli- -

his Polish-German forebearers,
Oskar’s birth is noted and, after
three «years of contemplating that
event, he decides not to grow any
more.

Oskar remains, on the outside,
a three-year—old, choosing a toy
drum as his symbol of non-adu1t-
hood. Throughout his youth, he

- wears drum after drum thin as he

expresses his thoughts and opin-
ions on the world around him.
.Most Insane

And that surrounding world is
probably the most insane that
history has ever offered. We see
Oskar mature as Nazism grows;
we see Oskar struggle in a so-

ciety that wants to rebuild him in '

its image; we see Oskar in the
miraculous act of living in that
period, ﬁghting, biting, cheating
his way through Europe’s 1930’s
and 1940’s.

The setting is ripe for the
Absurdist’s attitude, but Oskar
is not just an Albee or Ionesco
“voice.” Oskar is something
new, something original, but he
is also, basically, a human be-
ing. This is both his blessing
and his curse.

Oskar drums through the very
real world in a very unreal sense.

Using his glass—splintering voice
as his main tool, he plunges into

ties, the arts, and love. Rather
than simply trying to discover
their meanings, he more or less
simply tries them, because they
are what man has made and what
makes man.
Mocks and Imitates

Oskar, in turn, mocks and imi-
tates Christ, villiﬁes and shrugs
off the Nazi movement and the
war, becomes all too human in his
pursuit of love and discovers new
powers in themusic he plays.

In the course of all this, as
seen through numerous bril-
liant scenes, Oskar commits, or
believes he commits, a variety
of murders and ultimately is
locked up. He likes it. He can
tell stories to himself on his
drum. He hopes that his lawyer,
who is trying to clear him, will

_fail. And so he sits and drums
and writes.

- Is Oskar crazy? It doesn’t mat-
ter in the least. Is he a successful
rebel against society? That mat-
ters less: he was neither ﬁghting

Gunter Grass has written a
wild, -spinning story of a world
that is so perfect in its ugliness

we are forced to admire "it; a
world in which people must
gather together for a public onion-
peeling in order to remember how
to cry, a world in which eels are
considered a delicacy to eat but
a hideous sight when the ﬁsher-
man pulls them in. This is Oskar’s
unforgettable world. And it is too
much like ours. '

argue. -

We spend the money anyway,
Van Dyke explained, because we
want to gain an international
reputation for four things in or
der to build up our prestige: the
pursuit of creditable goals; the
ability to achieve these goa1s;,the
determination to .-achieve them;
and the assurance that the future
is in our hands. ._

If we were to renounce these
projects however, and decide
“nothing is worth the effort; great
deeds are not for us -- not even
middling ones,” We would become
a retrogessive society, Van Dyke
concluded. “And this is a choice
America couldn't make!”
