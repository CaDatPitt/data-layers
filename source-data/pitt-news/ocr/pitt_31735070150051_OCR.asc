Pitt releases
2011 crime

report

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

The total number of crimes
reported to University police,
local police and University of-
ficials has decreased every year
since 2009, according to the an-
nual Clery Act Campus Security
Report. -
Pitt released its Fall 2012
annual security and fire safety
report last Thursday. Included
in the report are crime statis-

tics mandated for release by the _

Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Cam-
pus Security Policy arid Campus
Crime Statistics Act.

In terms of the crime rate in-
dex —— a ﬁgure “based on the ac-
tual number of full-time equiva-
lent students’ and employees,
which is calculated according
to a state—mandated formul ” -
the total number of reported of-
fenses decreased from 3,171.21

in 2009 to 2,758.15 in 2010 to P

2,475.53 in 2012.

During the year 2011, the
most common infractions on
campus were for liquor law vio-
lations, with 157 arrests, down
from 169 in 2010. The number
of on—campus disciplinary refer-
rals for the same violation was
266 in 2011, 357 in 2010 and
330 in 2009.

The second most frequent
reason for arrest was drug law
violations, which accounted for
81 arrests, up from 39 in 2010
and 72 in 2009. There were 16
on—campus disciplinary refer-

Research team examines role of colors in nature

Matt Schaff
Senior Stayj’ Writer

From purple ﬂowers to red spiders

to yellow penguin feathers, a tre- ~

mendous diversity of colors marks
the natural world; and a group of
Pitt students wants to know why.
A Working together under. the
direction of Nathan Morehouse,
an assistant professor in the De-
partment of Biological Sciences
who arrived at Pitt just last year,
eight undergraduate biology en-
thusiasts are testing ideas as to
the roles that color might play in
the wild. .
“We study the use of color in
the animal kingdom,” Morehouse

said. “That takes us a lot of differ— '

ent places.” 7

One of those places is the realm
of butterﬂies. Along with fellow
students Cassandra Bartoch and
Ely Luna, senior ecology and
evolution major Natalie Roberts
focuses her attention on the Pieris
rapae, or the cabbage white but-
terﬂy.

Not unlike the intrigue that T

overcomes TV watchers won-
dering which strapping lad “the
bachelorette” will pick, the mat-
ing decisions of the female cab-
bage white fascinates Roberts. She
wants to ﬁgure out if females use

color to decide which male suitor i

would provide offspring with the
best chance of survival.

She’s interested for two rea-
sons: In this species, males with
greater nutrition have more color-
ful wings, and males contribute to
offspring by giving nutrients in ad-
dition to genetic material (unlike
human sperm, which only deals

in genes). The question becomes

whether the more colorful males
produce more nutrient—rich “sper—
matophores,” or mating packages.

“We’re. going to see if males that
have more, give more,” Roberts

said. To answer that question,

Roberts and others have bred
thousands of male caterpillars on
special diets with differing levels
of an essential nutrient protein,
allowed them to metamorphasize
into butterﬂies and produce sper-
matophores and then dissected
out the spermatophores one by
one.

As she’s currently assaying the
packages’ protein content, she’s
anxiously awaiting an answer. “In
science, you can discover stuff that

_ nobody else knows, which is really

exciting to me,” Roberts said.

An excitement, about color and
mating behavior does not uniquely
apply to Roberts, at least in the
Morehouse lab. On the contrary,
juniors Em Maier and Kevin By-
me want to learn how color could
inﬂuence certain female spiders’
decisions to mate with males in
the vicinity as opposed to another
common response — eating them.

The speciﬁc spiders under in-

vestigation, part of the Salticidae
family of “jumping spiders,” fea-
ture males with a splash of red on
their'faces, and prior results in

the lab have demonstrated that_

this red coloration can actually
help prevent males from being de-
voured. But Maier and Byrne want
to probe the mechanism, which
they suspect might have to do with
learning and memory.

“We’re trying to see if [female]
jumping spiders can learn to avoid
certain colors,” Byrne said. “And

V we’re going to see if they can take

that knowledge that they learned
about the colors and transfer it to
another aspect of their life —— from
foraging for food to mate choice.”

To ﬁnd out whether the spiders
show this memory “spill—over ef-
fect,” Maier and Byrne are trying
to produce what psychologists
might call a conditioned taste

   

   

aversion. First they develop two

.types of the same red—colored

prey, milkweed bugs: one that eats
toxic, distasteful milkweed seeds
and another that eats neutral sun-
ﬂower seeds.

7 Then they feed the toxic and
neutral-milkweed bugs to two
groups of female spiders, and at
the right moment, they setup ro-
mantic encounters with red—faced
males in petri dishes equipped
with video cameras. If their ex-
perience with toxic milkweed
bugs reduces the female spiders’
tendency to treat males as prey,
then the females have learned
something about the color red,
so the thinking goes.

With one round of males and
females having already met and
several more rounds planned, By-
rne looks forward to analyzing the

“When you put a certain
amount of work into something
and ﬁnally get that result, it’s that
much more rewarding,” he said.

As important as color might be
for the sexual reproduction danc-
es of insects and arachnids, so too
is it for ﬂowering plants. Working
with Morehouse and biological
sciences professor Susan Kalisz,
biology majors Ashley O’Connor
and Irtaza Asar want to know how
petal coloration could inﬂuence a
ﬂower’s attractiveness to the eyes

of pollinators, such as bees.

_ - The , subject is Collinsia het-
erophylla, a purple-and-white
ﬂowering plant known as Chinese
Houses. O’Connor and Asar are
spending the semester in close
contact with four different popu-
lations of heterophylla from four
counties in California, each popu-
lation bearing unique purple hues.

“Why would a ﬂower produce
so much variation?” O’Connor
said, though with a guess in mind.

“I think it’s going to really be the
contrast between the background
environment and the ﬂower that’s
going to make a difference for pol-
linators.”

~ - -...-E ..v

ARE YOU A SOPHOMORE OR A JUNIOR WITH A 3.0 QPA
INTERESTED IN STUDYING ABROAD, LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT

To test that hypothesis,
O’Connor and Asar have sequen-
tially measured ﬂower petals with
a light spectrometer. The spec-
trometer shines different wave-
lengths of light onto an object and
then measures which wavelengths
bounce off and which ones the
object absorbs.

In the heterophylla’s case, the
students have chosen 10 stan-
dard spots on the petal to shine
light, and based on the light that
bounces off, they hope to generate
descriptive reﬂection patterns for
each of the four plant populations.

With these patterns deter-
mined, the Morehouse lab will
then use math to guess at what
the most attractive pattern might
look like from a bee’s point of
view. Collaborating with a pro-
fessorial counterpart at the Free
University of Berlin in Germany,
Morehouse has access to troves of
data about the visual sensitivity of
several pollinator species. More-
house hopes to build from this
data mathematical models of the
pollinators’ visual systems and
then plug O’Connor and Asar’s
ﬂower patterns into the models.

The anticipated result? Real
insight into why bees decide to
approach one ﬂower over another.

Even with the ﬁnish line still
ahead, ‘Asar is proud of what his

team has accomplished so far.

“We’ve made so much progress
that we’re actually looking to get
published,” Asar said.

For students in the Morehouse
lab, investigating color’s role in
nature entails more than just col-
lecting data for publication. On
the one hand, given the distribu-
tion of research specimens across
refrigerators, greenhouses and
other facilities in every corner
of the Crawford-Langley—Clapp
complex, “there’s a lot of walking
involved,” Asar said.

Daily exercise aside, students
also talk of community bonding.
From attending rugby games to
art exhibits to zombie museums,
the Morehouse lab makes a point
of interacting outside of work
hours. , , ,

“We’iie' serious whenwe need
to be, but we can have alot of fun
too,” Bartoch said. “I think we’re
a very close lab, and I love that
about us.”

This feeling of community
helps motivate the undergradu-
ate researchers, including junior
Zarreen Amin, who contributes
to a separate project in the More-
house lab.

“I’m not just doing it for me,”
she said. “I’m doing it for other
people, too.”

Where the lab fosters a sense

of belonging with others, it does
the same toward nature.

“One of the tragedies of mod-
ern culture is that we lack mean-
ingful interaction with living
things,” Morehouse said, con-
trasting outside realities with his
agenda for students in the lab.
“I hope to inspire them to take a
closer and hopefully longer look
at the natural world. I want them
to ﬁnd biology is their home.”

Students seem to have gotten
the message.

“Just because it’s not human
doesn’t make it unimportant,”
Roberts said, referring to her
butterﬂy research. “It’s part of
the natural world. We think we’re
something above that, but we’re
just a part of it.”

In the Morehouse lab, accom-
plishing oneness with nature hap-
pens alongside building an appre-'
ciation for the scientiﬁc process.

“It’s like being lost in a forest
and trying to ﬁnd your way out,”
Asar said. “It’s really the most
genuineway of living.”

O’Connor takes the sentiment
further, framing the cause for
ecological research in existential
terms. “If we decide to stop asking
questions ‘why,’ then how can we
possibly evolve?” I

tions, down from 20 in 2010.

There were three reported ag-
gravated assaults on campus in
2011 and two in both 2010 and
2009. There were 16 aggravat-
ed assaults on public property
reported in 2011, nine in 2010
and 13 in 2009. There were four
instances of forcible sexual of-
fenses, down from seven last year.
The total number of on—campus
nonforcible sexual offenses has
remained at zero for the past
three years.

There have been no reports of
murder or negligent manslaugh-
ter, neither on campus nor off
campus, in the past three years.

Pitt spokesman Robert}/Hill ex-
pressed his happiness with the
results of the report in an email.

“We are glad to see a down-
ward trend of the overall Uni-
form Crime rate index over the
last three years, although various
units in the University continue to
look at ways to address criminal
and other issues related to sub-
stance abuse,” Hill said.

Use a “designated texter” to avoid danger

A high school student participates in a texting-while-driving simulation. MCT Campus

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

Think about what you’re doing the
next time you decide to text while
driving. I had never paid much at-
tention to texting until this past
weekend, when I saw a red-deco-
rated air bag through the window
of a car.

My passenger instantly shouted
for my attention, as we had just
picked up my new car from the
dealership. It was a beautiful Sat-
urday on I-279, and I was primed to
begin texting my friends about the
purchase while we ﬂew down the
highway-

Quickly looking to my right, I
could see a PT Cruiser’s air bags had
deployed, and I began to realize that
Iwas going as fast as the car thatwas
careening onto the other side of the
guard rail. Within afew seconds, the
carwas airborne. It had lost velocity

‘ by slamming into the hillside, and it
plowed over afew small trees before
ending up a garbled wreck. My eyes

i , were quickly plastered back on the

road while my hands shook. _
With the phone already in my

. right palm, I called 911 immediately

to report the ﬁndings. For the rest
of the ride, I drove the speed limit
‘ and left my phone securely in the
cup holder while the scene replayed
in my head. My friend .was equally

' stunned. We made it home safel

that day. - »
Unfortunately, this was not the
fate of those involved in the ac-
cident I had witnessed. Ilearned
later that evening that the lives of
two people had been lost because of

driving distractions.

Just how distracting can texting
be? A study published in late 2009
by University of Utah researchers
found a “sixfold increase of crashes
when participants were text—mes-
saging and driving,” compared
with those who were not texting.
The same simulated driving study,
led by psychology professor David

Strayer, concluded that “impair-.

ments associated with using a cell
phone while driving can be as pro-
found as those associated with driv-
ing while drunk.”

Society doesn’t condemn “text
driving” in the same way it does
drunk driving. You would stop your
friend if he tried to drive home
drunk, but would you tell your
friend to “stop sending that text
message” while driving? It almost
sounds silly. It should be spoken
within the same breath, though, as
both are equally dangerous.

4 U.S. Secretary of Transporta-
tion Ray LaHood announced last
year that, in a poll, 37 percent of
adults said that they texted while
driving. Surely with more devices in
the hands of our young drivers, this
number will increase.

So we ask ourselves, what can be
done?

First and foremost, laws need to
be set in place, as we quickly realize
that it’s not just us that play a role,
but companies and government
alike. But welhave made progress.
The number of states with dis-
tracted driving laws has more than
doubled from 18 states in 2009 to
39 today. Many government em-
ployees are prohibited ﬁ'om texting

while driving a government vehicle
on the job, as well.

Secondly, as our generation is
supplied with iPhones at the age of
ﬁve, this technology problem needs
a technology solution. While car
companies and mobile phone pro-
viders are supplying the consum-
ers with hands—free calling, dicta-
tion software and new apps that
could prevent texting while on the
move, money needs to continue to
be spent on technological tools and
services to make our roads safer.

Above all, I believe we need to
change our social norms. Drunk
driving and texting while driving
must become synonymous with
one another. This starts with pub-
lic education on the dangers of text
driving.

The FCC has outlined steps and
actions that should be taken to
educate teens and other text—savvy
drivers on the dangers of text driv-
ing. While these steps —- which
help parents set guidelines for teen-
age drivers — are a good start, we
need to encourage our friends as we
try to push for a more potent social
norm.

Drunk driving deaths have been
cut in half since the 1980s through
public awareness and education.
New social norms have been es-
tablished, including the “DD” or
“designated driver.” While a “desig-
nated texter” sounds a bit absurd, if
it could have saved lives during the
horriﬁc accident that I witnessed, I
would gladly assume that role, and I
believe others would as well. 3

helps to spread

disability awareness

Sean Corrado
Staff lVrz'ter

Jennifer Bartlett began the poetry reading
slowly, working her way up a ‘small set of
stairs to the podium. Her limbs shook slight-
ly as she balanced herself at the microphone
with aid from surrounding audience mem-
bers. After graciously welcoming the audi-
ence, she ended her time on stage with a se-
lection from her work in an anthology: “I am
all motion and / this motion is neither weak
nor hideous / this motion is simply my own.”

Bartlett, who was born with cerebral pal-
sy, is co—editor of the new poetry anthology,
“Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disabil-

ity.” The groundbreaking collection speaks V

of experiences through a disability perspec-
tive and raises awareness of how others
should perceive disability.

Ellen Smith, a lecturer in Pitt’s English
department, organized a two-day event tak-
ing placezat various locations on Pitt’s cam-
pus to present the main ideas from the new
anthology. She hoped a poetry reading at
the 0’Hara Student Center and a roundtable
discussion in Pitt’s Humanities Center would
provide a diverse approach to poetry and
some new knowledge on disabilities. _

“People think that a disability is some-
thing that you are born with and needs to be
ﬁxed,” Smith said. “The proper experiences
of disability need to be represented.”

After passage of the Americans" With
Disabilities Act of 1990, disability poetry
jumped out into the writing world. But Mi-

thology, noted that poetry did not originally

This week, I’m dealing with a time—manage—
ment nightmare.‘ I’m studying for three ex-
ams, keeping up with my homework, working
seemingly countless hours and, on top of that,
writing this column.

Did I mention that I’m occasionally sleep-
ing, as well?

One thing that I absolutely have to ﬁt in to
my busy schedule is eating. And if there’s any
way that I can make some delicious comfort
food to keep me going through the week, I’m
going to jump at the opportunity.

Thankfully, I’ve got a trick to make home-
cooked meals a possibility in my hectic life:
slow cooker recipes. ‘

Slow cookers afford you the ability to cook

' hearty, fulﬁlling meals without spending pre-

cious time in the kitchen. And for most reci-
pes, the instructions are simple: Mix the in-
gredients, turn on the slow cooker and walk

focus on the direct encounters of disability.
In fact, the work shied away from revealing
how the true experiences of a disabled per-
son play out.

Now, “Beauty is at Verb” takes an extra
step to show its audience how disability
works and how these authors have personal

‘missions to correct issues that disabled indi-

viduals can face.

Bartlett, who admits she speaks more
clearly when she is reading poetry, has taken
time to teach poetry classes to people with
cognitive or physical disabilities at -United
Cerebral Palsy of New York City. She said
that the students there, all of whom had no

experience of a disabled person in a position ~

of authority, were able to really connect with
her.

“I had [helped] students with a hidden
disability, like visual impairments and dys-
lexia, to feel more comfortable with them-
selves,” Bartlett said at the roundtable dis-
cussion.

Like Bartlett, Smith has also experienced
disability in a classroom setting. .-

Smith has a situational hearing impair-
ment in which her auditory skills diminish
depending on the environment she is in and
the tone of voice of a speaker. Her writings
are also collected in “Beauty is a Verb,” and
they represent the ﬁrst time Smith has writ-
ten openly about her own disability.

“We need to be more open about any dis-

ability and become more aware of certain ‘

disabilities when we encounter a person,”
she said, describing how both those with
and without disabilities need to let each oth-
er know in order for more people to address
these issues. '

away until your food is ready.

This means that while you’re doing laun-
dry, working on homework, cleaning the
house and chugging your sixth cup of coffee,
you can also be cooking a fulﬁlling dinner that
will give you the energy to plow through your
chaotic schedule.

Slow cooking is the ideal method for cre-
ating soups and stews. The slow heating pro-
cess in a moist environment tenderizes meat
and infuses its ﬂavors into broths. Fresh veg-
etables such ascarrots, celery and onions can
be thrown into the mix to cook alongside the
meat and bring their own _ﬂavors to the dish. -

My favorite meal to cook in a slow cooker
is pulled pork. It’s the easiest recipe I’ve ever

seen and there are few meals more deliciously
comforting than a juicy, smoky pulled pork
sandwich.

Step one, mix shredded pork with your

“Beauty is a \!erb:The New Poetry of Disability” gives poets the space to express be-

liefs on disability. "

But Bartlettiand Smith said there is a lack
of disability awareness at times.

“I found out there was a focus on aware-
ness for transgender and age while teach-
ing,” Bartlett said. “That surprised me be-
cause there are many more disabled people
out there [than transgendered people] .”

Katherine Seelman, associate dean’ of
Pitt’s School of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences, said there are more than 60 mil-
lion people in the United States living with a
disability. Lynette Van Slyke from the Office
of Disability Services says Pitt has more than
600 disabled people. . 7-

favorite barbecue sauce in a slow cooker and
turn on the machine. Step two, you’re done.
If you’re looking for variation, you can always
switch pork out for another shredded meat
(chicken works very well) and everyone has
their own special barbecue sauce blend that
they like to incorporate; feel free to work with
ingredients such as honey, liquid smoke and
chili powder to create your own.

Hopeﬁilly, you’re interested in trying out a
slow cooker by now. But you’re probably won-
dering where exactly you’re supposed to get
your hands on an appliance that doesn’t come
standard in the average Oakland kitchen.

If you aren’t lucky enough to have friends
who will loan you theirs for an afternoon, you
could think about purchasing one.

Many small models are relatively cheap,
and small-sized slow cookers are easy to store
away when they’re not in use. A quick browse
of Amazon.com shows basic 3—quart models
in the $20-to—$25 price ‘range. Larger, more
expensive models‘ come with built—in timers
and fancy settings to keep food warm, but

these perks aren’t necessary for any recipe
that a college student would choose to make.
If you’re looking to trade up from a smaller
model, one of these larger models might be a
good choice. But if you’re akin to the average
college student, who’s only cooking meals for
himself and the occasional friend or room-

mate, a cheaper, 3- or 4—quart model is deﬁ-

nitely a better option. _

This week, I’m cooking a big, hearty chick-
en and rice casserole that will make enough
leftovers to feed me for most of the week. It’s
a pretty basic recipe, so it should be a gréat
introduction to the art of slow cooking for be-
ginners. " -

While the casserole cooks, I’ll be study-
ing Quantitative Methods notes. And when
I come home from long nights of newspaper
editing, I’ll have a delicious late-night dinner
waiting at home for me.

Amidst the craziness of my schedule this '

week, keeping my slow cooker handy means
that I’ll be able to whip up a variety of deli-
cious meals while still ﬁnding time to pass my
courses. N

niﬁcant following  recent years. But people
with disabilities still ﬁnd themselves at dis-
advantages in employment and education.

Smith and many of the other writers and
editors of the anthology agree that the neg-
ligence to ﬁx some of these issues is psycho-
logical. , x .

“I think the fear comes from our own
deepest fears about our bodies,” Smith said.

your life can change.” '

In 2007, Duvall participated in a sledding
event at the Petersen Events Center, where he
injured his spinal cord. The accident left him
in a wheelchair and at a loss about howito get
around campus.

Duvall later organized a group of students

with disabilities to come together and help i, . g

each other learn about what is accessible -on
campus. -Today, he still wants to address is-
sues on campus and in all of Pittsburgh for
people with disabilities. g

“Beauty is a Verb” hopes to win some sup-
port for issues surrounding disability across

the country through powerful, emotional»

writing. The anthology was named to the
American Library Association’s 2012 Notable
Books'List and is goinglthrough its second
printing. ' T

“Our mission is to get these writings read ’

and to get people to know who these writers
are and what experiences they can share,”

Cincinnati, Louisville sweep Panthers in conference play

 

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Having home-court advantage did little
to help the Pitt women’s volleyball team
last weekend, as it dropped a pair of Big
East matches without winning a set at the
Fitzgerald Field House.’

Cincinnati defeated the Panthers 3-0
on Friday night and Sunday brought the
same result as No. 17 Louisville also beat
Pitt in three straight sets.

According to Pitt head coach Toby
Rens, the weekend was a major disap-
pointment.

“We are a better team than what we
showed this weekend in our two match-
es,” Rens said. “Going forward, we need
to do a better job of being consistent on
our side of the net, and if we do, the wins
will take care of themselves.”

Sophomore outside hitter Mechael
Guess agreed, noting that her team’s
mental focus was not at the level it need-
ed to be.

“When we play tough teams like Cin-
cinnati and Louisville, we have to bring
high intensity to each set of each match,

V and we did not do that this weekend,”

Guess said. “That mental preparation is

‘ important.”

Cincinnati 3, Pitt 0

In their ﬁrst conference match at
home, the Panthers (10-8, 1-3 Big East)
lost to the Bearcats (4-11, 2-1 Big East)
with set scores of 25-9; 25-17 and 25-19.

Cincinnati jumped out to an early 7-2
lead in the opening set and held the Pan-
thers to just nine points before collecting
the set win.

The Panthers managed to improve
their efforts in the second set and used
a solo block by freshman Jessica Boddy
to bring the score to 7-6. But a’ 9-2 run
helped the Bearcats gain a 16-8 advan-
tage that they maintained throughout the
set.

Pitt held the lead in the third set- at
12-5, thanks largely to three consecutive
blocks. However, the Bearcats battled
back and tied the score at 17 points each.
Cincinnati scored -eight of the ﬁnal 10
points to ensure the set and overall match
victory.

The Panthers were led offensively by
freshman Amanda Orchard and senior
Alexa Campbell, who each contributed
six kills. Margy Acton, a senior libero,
paced the defense with her 14 digs.

“Amanda was a bright spot off the
bench and I was pleased with that,” Rens
said. He also noted the difficulty in facing
the reigning Big East Champion in Cin-

A GRAIN OF SAUL

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

As Martin Kaymer lined up a 6-foot par
putt on the 18th hole Sunday at the Ryder
Cup, one of two things could have hap-

 pened.

With a make, the Europeans would
match the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup
history and pull off an unprecedented vic-
tory against the U.S. team. With a miss,
the Americans would have been awarded
a half—point, forcing a ﬁnal hole, where a

" ‘” prowling Tiger Woods had a 1—stroke lead

in the middle of the 18th fairway —- a huge
advantage to the Americans.

But with the pressure of the tourna-
ment and an entire continent placed on his

shoulders, Kaymer was icy cool. He sank’

.,, the putt to defeat American Steve Stricker,
and celebrations ensued at the Medinah
Country Club, outside of Chicago.

The putt completed not just an incred-
ible comeback, but also an incredibly

 Americans melt down at M

emotional victory for the Europeans. All
weekend, the talk had been about Seve
Ballesteros — the former heart and soul
of European golf in the Ryder Cup — who
died in May of 2011 of a brain tumor.

As a tribute, the European team wore
navy blue —— Ballesteros’ favorite color —
and a silhouette of the golﬁng legend on
the sleeves of their shirts. The same im-
age could also be found on bags and hats
throughout the weekend.

It was an unusual weekend for the Euro-
pean team in other ways, too.

On Sunday, the No. 1-ranked player in
the world, Rory Mcllroy, nearly missed
his tee time after thinking he was meant to
tee off an hour later than he was. Luckily,
while Mcllroy strolled out of his hotel, he

got a phone call that he had to tee off in 25
minutes. ’

Somehow, he managed to ﬁnd a po-

team,” Rens added. “They are a junior-

with a great focus.”

dinals used three kills and a service ace to
earn the set and match victory.

For the second match in a row, the
Panthers failed to have any player record
double—digit kills, as freshman Jessica
Wynn led the way with eight. Acton once
again led the team in digs with 15.

According to freshman KateAYeazel —
who tallied seven kills on 20 attempts in
the match — the Panthers brought their

best efforts in the

, not enough to earn
the win.

“I thought we
played very well in
the third set and
had a lot of inten-
sity,” Yeazel said.
“We need to ﬁnd
a way to maintain
that level through-

In the second set, Louisville dominat-

Pitt managed to open the third set
with a 5-2 lead and kept the score close,
tying the set at 18-18. However, the Car-

For Guess, the matches will be a
chance for Pitt to get back to its winning
ways. 4

“Playing on the roadcan be tough, as
it is a different environment and a differ-
ent crowd,” Guess said. “Still, I think we
can bounce back and bring our best ef-
forts to get the wins.” ﬂ

Had Mcllroy been more than ﬁve min-
utes late, he would have been disqualiﬁed
and likely lost the Cup for the Europeans.

On Saturday, one" of ESPN’s most popu-
lar golf columnists — Gene Wojciechowski
— wrote theIEuropeans off as they entered
the competition’s ﬁnal day down 10-6 in a

. race to 14.5 points.

, “Team Europe canstill win if the fol-
lowing ﬁve things happen Sunday: Keegan

columnist wrote. ‘ 

The Europeans must not have gotten
Wojciechowski’s message.

“It’s been done in the past,” said Ian
Poulter, one of Europe’s best players, on
Saturday when the odds were stacked
against his team. “It’s going to be done
again. That’s all we can ask.” '

It turns out that winning eight of the re-
maining 12 matches wasn’t too far—fetched
after all. -

Even more impressive, Europe was an-
chored on Sunday by four guys who hadn’t
won a match all weekend "— Kaymer, Pe-
ter Hanson, Francesco Molinari and Paul
Lawrie.

Meanwhile, Stricker and Woods, the
two anchors in the U.S. lineup, didn’t win a‘-’
match all weekend.

Suddenly, the European Ryder Cup col-
lapse 13 years ago seems like it was yester-
day.

That year, the Americans overcame an
identical 10-6 deﬁcit, but they did it out,
their own turf.

But last weekend, the Europeans fought
against USA cheers that started three
hours before the ﬁrst tee-off. They fought
against Woods, Stricker, Jim Furyk, Bubba
Watson and Phil Mickelson.

“1999 was fun,” Furyk told ESPN. “This

was pretty miserable.”
