Students ousted
after second fire

By Lisa Gordon
The Pitt News 0

A three-alarm fire at 47 Zulema
Street in Oakland has left four Pitt
students temporarily homeless. The
fire started at 10:30 a.m. Saturday.
No one was seriously injured, but
Mahmood Nazar Mohamed was
treated and released from
Presbyterian-University hospital.

Mohamed, 25, burned his right
arm when he was attempting to call
on the phone for help, according to
the report filed by Pittsburgh police.

According to Mrs. Mike Khalil,
owner of the two-story insulated
brick structure: “Mohamed was
cooking in the kitchen when he
noticed that the wall was on fire. He
ran and woke up his roommates.
Mohamed ran out wearing only his

‘ robe and shorts »- he did not even

have his shoes on.”

The other occupants in the second
floor apartment were Leonard
Mohamed, 22, and Mohd Noah, 26.

The first ﬂoor was occupied by
Othmean Cheali, 26. Cheali moved
into the apartment just 12 ‘hours
before the fire occurred.

All went to family and friends for
temporary shelter. Khalil said that
the three men in the second-ﬂoor
apartment would be moving into
3618 Bates Street, another building
owned byiher family.

Fire Chief Thomas stated in the
police report that the origin of the
fire was on the second floor but the
exact spot has yet to be determined.
It is presently under investigation by
an arson squad. A fire officer from

Station No. 4 said the report from
the arson squad will not be available
until sometime on Monday. But, he
added, there are" coincidences
between this blaze and the one that
occurred in the 3500 block of the
Boulevard of the Allies last
Saturday.

First, he said, both buildings were
owned by the same family. Elias
Khalil, of 3614 Bates Street, owns
the houses on the Boulevard; his
brother, Mike Khalil, owns the
Zulema Street property. Also, both
blazes occurred on a Saturday and
the damaged apartments were being
by Malasian students. Concerning a
motive, Inspector Ward Said, “We
are not sure if it was some crazy
Vietnamese doing this out of
revenge or an insurance fire.”

The property damage is estimated
at $25,000, and according to Mrs.
Mike Khalil, “lam not sure if we are
going to have to tear the building
down yet, but it is totaled.”

“Last week’s blaze [the one on the
Boulevard],” stated Ward, “was
arson. Fires were set in two different
houses on the block.” .

Mrs. Khalil said that someone
might be sabotaging them. She
noted: “They have a suspect. It is a
man who owns three houses on the
Boulevard; Elias Khalil owns one.
And as for our_ house, the inspection
has shown that the stereo amplifier
and television were hooked into the
same outlet. It might have been their
faulty plugs and not our outlet.”

The house next door at 45 Zulema
Street also sustained fire damage.

second--ﬂoor apartment lost every-

Management concerns   GSPIA founder

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

Before coming to the University
of Pittsburgh to found the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA), Professor Donald
C. Stone led a long and very distin-
guished life in public service to his
country. After much success as an
administrator at a city and state
governmental level, Stone was
tapped by the Roosevelt administra-
tion in the late l930s to oversee the
management of several New Deal
agencies. Stone developed what he
called “comprehensive management
systems" in order to make these
agencies work efficiently. Perhaps
the best example to cite would be the
Work Projects Administration, at

Nationality Room.

—————lnside Today

Artwork shown Snag hit

Art exhibit held to help finance the Romanian

the time the largest federal appropri-
ation ever — $4.6 billion or one-
fourth of the previous federal
budget, according to Stone. He des-
cribed the WPA as “one of the best-
planned federal programs in
advance ever initiated.”

“This [planning] has been a major
problem over the years, but espe-
cially back under President Johnson
in the 19605. All kinds of new pro-
grams were launched without the
planning necessary. Many of these
did not work very well,” said Stone.

This is a recurrent theme in the
interview. Stone looked back on a
career concerned with “manage-
ment, improving the management of
government.” He said the most sig-
nificant role he ever played was in
the Bureau of the Budget, now
known as the Office of Management
and Budget. It was while in this

capacity that Stone oversaw the
establishment of the Executive
Office of the President, creating the
executive branch of government
that exists today. After this, Stone
went on to be the director of admin-
istration for the Marshall Plan. He
was a member ofthe U.S. delegation
in establishing the United Nations
and the U.S. representative in Lon-
don to the UNESCO Preparatory
Commission. These just touch on a
few of the many accomplishments in
his career.

Today, Stone is an adjunct profes-
sor of Public Management at

Carnegie-Mellon University’s

School of'Urban and Public Affairs.
He is actively promoting his latest
endeavor, the Coalition to Improve
Management in State and Local
Government, of which he is director.
Professor Stone is donating his ser-

vices to the coalition, which is indic-
ative of a lifelong concern for better
government.

The following are exerpts from an
interview with the professor, who
time and again expressed his opin-
ion that government is in dire need
of better management.

DCIDD

Pitt News: As we've gone over your
career, you've stressed how well-
planned these agencies were.’ Would
you say that today 's budget crisis is
due to poor management?

Stone: Yes, I'd say so. 1 would say
the crisis is due in part to ihe fact
that the government has not had in
top positions persons oftop quality.

Pitt News: Why not?

Stone: Because there haven’t been
presidents with that interest. [They]
are much more ideological. The
government has been far more polit-
icized. Political patronage plays an
enormously greater part than it did
in the period I’m talking about. I was
a non-partisan professional, and so
was my staff. The only person
between me and the president was
also a non-partisan professional.
Today, for about three layers
down [in management], those posi-
tions are political appointments.
They are not professionals and that
makes a great deal of difference in
competence and trustworthiness.
That’s a major difference.

Romanian artist showcased
in pnvate exhiblt fund-raiser

By Lisa Gordon
The Pitt News

An art exhibit featuringthe works
of Romanian artist Oltea Maria
Zuca opened at a private showing on
Saturday. The show is being co-
sponsored by the fine arts depart-
ment and the Romanian Room
committee. It is being displayed in
the University Art Gallery of the
Frick Fine Arts Building.

John Halamaghi, :£hC artist's
brother-in-law, has agreed to donate
25 percent of the profits to the
Romanian» Room. Halamaghi is
happy with the exhibit. He said: “1
am pleased with the show. The art

looked a lot different in a small‘
room at my home —- here it looks

much better.”-

According to Maxine Bruhns,
director of the Nationality Rooms
program: “The money will go into
an account for the Romanian Room
committee. It can be used for schol-_
arships for study in Romania, to
bring in a lecturer or for a cultural
event such as a film or exhibit.”

Zuca (1920-1980) was born in the
village of Cernauti. She received an
M.A. for philosophy and letters
from the University of Bucharest in
1945. The same year, she married
Theodore Zuca, a Greek citizen. She
also studied with D. Stefanescli, an
expert in Byzantine art history and a
teacher in Sorbonne.

The works of this second exhibit
(she also had one in 1971) vary.
Director David Wilkins said: “This
was a difficult exhibit to display. We
had to work with two kinds of art ——~
realistic paintings and religious

icons. But it all went together in
harmony."

The show was mounted by five
members of the Fine Arts 102
Museum Exhibitions class. They
are: Maria Arzenti, Mrea Corba,
Melody English and lnda Noerhadi.
They were supervised by Wilkins
and Matthew Roper, assistant direc-
tor. “This was their first attempt at
putting a show together. No one had
prior experience, but the final out-
put turned out great,” noted
Wilkins.

Over 100 people turned out to
view Zuca’s works. DAKA, the uni-
versity food service, served hors
d’oeuvres and wine.

The show is open to the public and
ends Feb. 20. The oil paintings range
from $500 to $3500; the icons range
from $250 to $1,000.

Government management concerns GSPIA fgunder

continued from page one

Pitt News: Today 's government
administrator says he has no control
over the bureaucracy he adminis-
ters. There's a wild bureaucracy run
amok.

Stone: That, sir, is a myth. This is an
idea that is engendered by presiden-
tial candidates and others who find
it politically popular to blame the
problems of the government not on
the political people who got us into
trouble but on the people whom they

call bureaucrats. Any competent -

person who comes in, whether secre-
tary of a department or head of an
agency, can win that staff over ifthat
person takes that staff into confi-
dence and motivates them instead of
calling them incompetent, lazy
people.

The present administration and
the Carter Administration lost the
kind of creative support they could
have gotten out of the permanent
career people because of their own
incompetence in knowing how to
administer. What happens is that
many of the best persons in govern-
ment go, leaving a residue of less
competent people. So there are
problems of weeding out incompe-

tent people.

Pitt News: But isn ‘t it hard to recruit
people because the income to be had
in government service is not compet-
itive with private industry?

Stone: I don't think that is anywhere
near the problem it’s made out to be.

Pitt News: Michael Deaver says he
can ’t get by in Washington on
$70,000 per year.

Stone: Well, he isn’t worth any more
than that in the government. It isn’t
the Deavers that are crucial, it’s get-
ting career professional people who
are committed to public service and
not to becoming wealthy.

What we have are a lot of people
around Washington whose interest
is in making money and making
fame. A lot of these people after tak-
ing office, as Deaver will do, will
capitalize on those experiences.
They become valuable to special
interests. They go to work for adver-
tising firms and legal firms and gain

’ a lot of profit - just because they

had that appointment. That’s one of
our major problems.

Pitt News: We ’ve withdrawn from
UNESCO.

Stone: We've withdrawn from it in
part because we didn’t link ourselves
up adequately with other countries
that shared our concerns in a con-
certed way to bring enormous pres-
sure on UNESCO and its director
general to make the changes that
need to be made.

This is where the present ad minis-
tration can be seriously faulted. It
does not think in terms of working
cooperatively with international
organizations. As a matter of fact,
we haven’t had a presidency in some
time that really understood that the
future peace and security and well-
being of this world depends on the
development of international organ-
izations and the rule of law.

Neither candidate [in the last elec-
tion], Reagan nor Mondale, even
referred to the United Nations in the
foreign policy debate or to any col-
lective international effort. In other
words, you can draw the conclusion
that the U.S. is going to go it alone
and push people around and decide
what should be done and use force to
get its way. That’s the conclusion
that other countries have drawn.

Pitt News: Has U.S. inﬂuence
declined in the United Nations?

Stone: There's a myth about the
influence of the Soviet Union. The
influence of the Soviet Union is de-
clining. Any inﬂuencethe Soviets do
have is due to a vacuum because of
the lack of influence of the U.S. and
the lack of the United States‘ work-
ing on relationships with countries
to create policies and programs to
bring [countries] into the western
orbit.

We suppress any dissident or
revolutionary movement, particu-
larly in Latin America —- and the
case of Central America is a good
illustration at the present time — we
force these movements into the
hands of Moscow and Cuba. If we
played. our cards in a sensible way
and did not assume we could solve
things by the use of force in Nicara-
gua, it would have been the presi-
dent or vice president down there at
the inauguration [of Daniel Ortega]
and not Castro. Anybody who
understands the history of Cuba and
what took place knows that we gave
Castro no alternative but to turn to
Moscow.

Pitt News: Yes, Battista is a good
example of our support for strong
men overseas. You look at what
happened in Iran, it happened in
Nicaragua and it will probably
happen in the Phillipines.

Stone: That’s right. So when you're
talking about enlightened foreign
policy, sure, you’ve got to have mil-
itary power, but that‘s just to main-
tain the peace while you do a dozen
other things that are necessary to
create the kind of relationships in
the world you want.

It was this kind of background
that I brought with me to GSPIA.
When I came to Pittsburgh to estab-
lish GSPI-A, we developed programs
to produce persons to move into
important channels of responsibility
in city, county, state and interna-
tional organizations.

We developed our programs
based on consultations with federal
agencies, cities, counties and states,
the United Nations, the World Bank

and several national associations.

That’s how the GSPIA program

emerged. And because we brought

in as faculty those persons who’d
had experience as city managers,

Life’s Not So Bad

On my way to Pitt the other day,l
boarded a PAT bus and greeted the
driver with a friendly, “Good
morning.”

He looked at me, lowered his
furry eyebrows and hollered “Just

get on the bus! We don't have all‘

day!" Boy, was I llabbergasted.

As I stood in the aisle, an older
woman barged into me. “Get out of
my way!” she yelled. As I prepared
to shift,"she proceeded to push me
aside, storming past everyone until
she exited the bus. How disconcert-
ing. She even looked like a sweet old
lady.

Fate had its way, and I was bom-
barded the entire day with miserable
individuals. All day, people walked
past me, some moping, some storm-
ing around, all unpleasant. I would
just smile and keep going.

I really tried to remain pleasant
despite the undesirable atmosphere.
I must admit, though, I was forcing
my smile by the end of the day.

Look folks, we definitely have a
dilemma here which must somehow
be resolved. But before I propose
any viable solutions, I must define
the core of the problem.

After an intense examination, it

suddenly dawned on me what the
problem was. Frankly, I believe that
those people merely get up in the
morning on the wrong side of the
bed. More precisely, I think they
perhaps roll or fall out of bed.
i I suppose the manner by which
they crawl out of bed really doesn’t
matter, but something at that point
in time seems to create in these
heavy-laden souls a dreary attitude
toward the day ahead of them.

Take Monday’ mornings, for

example. For some odd reason, the
very idea of waking up Monday
morning seems to send many people
into a week-long state of misery.
Why? As far as I'm concerned, wak-
ing up Monday morning is no better
or worse than waking up any other
‘morning.

You know, one Thursday morn-
ing I got off to a less-than-pleasant
start. A friend of mine asked me
what was wrong. I shook my head
and answered simply, “It’s Thursday
morning.” He looked at me strange-
ly, shrugged his shoulder and
walked away.

I guess that for some, Monday
mornings represent the end of the
weekend and the beginning ofa long
journey toward the next weekend.
You see, they live for the weekend.
To tell you the truth, though, I’m not
quite sure why. -

Many of these’ folks struggle
through the week until Friday, when
they are sort of set free. They run out
that night to celebrate the arrival of
the weekend, rejoice into the wee
hours and come crawling home to
bed. This is amusing, though,
because the weekend is now history
as they spend the rest of the weekend
recuperating. Oh, well. ~

Weather seems to affect a person’s

~ attitude toward the day ahead of

him. When the sun shines, people
are cheerful. But when it rains or
snows, forget it. These same people
become irritable and even hostile.
They just don't seem to enjoy wet-
ness, but then again, neither do I. I
have found that an umbrella, rain-
‘oat and galoshes solve that prob-
lem. Try them.

Some people, I think, wake up

Why Not?/ Mauriceg,,,MalIi,n_

Of Arms and Arms Control

Both the United States and the
Soviet Union seem to recognize that
there is no utility in actually using
nuclear weapons against each other,
for to do so will certainly lead to
their own devastation. The certainty
of retaliation upon an aggressor has
been the principle upon which mutu-
al nuclear deterrence has been prac-
ticed. The superpowers have gone
far to insure their own self-deter-
rence by remaining as vulnerable as
possible to a nuclear attack by
deploying no nuclear defenses of any
significance.

Paradoxically, while both are
deterred from initiating nuclear war,
both are unsure that the other is
deterred. Each works to insure that
the other will not be tempted into
launching a first strike. This effort is
known as the search for “stability.”

Unfortunately, the two means
through which stability has been
sought have led to increased distrust
between the powers and massive

growths in their nuclear arsenals.

The first method is strategic arms
buildups. A robust nuclear force, the
theory goes, will leave little doubt in

your opponent’s mind of your abil-
ity to retaliate were he to strike first.
However, arms building has led to
arms racing, as weapon is piled upon
weapon. For example, in the ’50s the
Soviets demonstrated the capacity
to develop ballistic missiles (with
Sputnik). We accelerated our missile
program. In the ’70s, the U.S.
deployed multiple nuclear warheads
on their missiles; the Soviets quickly
followed suit.

The history ofthe arms race is the
history of distrust. To obviate any
doubt of its retaliatory capability, a
superpower builds up its retaliatory
forces. The other superpower per-
ceives the buildup as an attempt to
attain superiority and responds with

even more powerful or accurate

weapons. This, of course, makes for
a very unstable relationship.. ‘
For example, the MX missile will
carry 10 highly accurate warheads.
Its purpose is to respond to a present
Soviet advantage in numbers of
land-based missiles. Say the Soviets
were ahead I0 missiles to one
(though it isn’t that bad). Since the
MX can conceivably target 10

determined to have a bad day. They
become miserable_ individuals just
for the sake of being miserable. I
would find that a difficult way to go
through life.

A person's misery would not be so
bad if it didn’t affect others, but as
luck would have it, others are
affected. Many days have been gra-
ciously ruined for me by thoughtful
strangers wishing to share their mis-
ery with the world. They grumble
and growl, complain and bark,
reflecting a glowing aura of, well,
grief. One can almost see the dark
cloud that looms above them.

And think of the bad decisions
made by people who are having a
bad day. Imagine all the employees
who have been fired merely because
their bosses have started the morn-
ing from the wrong side of the bed.
Oh, and by the way, I wonder what
could happen if good ol’ Ron Rea-
gan had a bad day. Scary, huh?

I really only have a few sugges-
tions that might possibly help those
troubled souls. For one thing, they
will definitely have to lighten up a
little. They must develop a cheerier
outlook on life and look at each day
as a new experience, although I do
realize that not every experience.is
worth rejoicing about.

Also, it really doesn’t hurt to
laugh. You ‘know, I started a day
once by having to stop the oncoming
traffic so that I could catch a passing
bus. As I entered the bus, my foot
slipped, sending me up the aisle on
my stomach, books flying. Getting
up, I couldn't help but laugh. Let’s
face it, I made a complete fool of
myself -— and brightened everyone
else’s day. '

Be nice to people. Don’t inﬂict a
sour mood on others. Besides, one
might never know the rash of misery
that could spread just because one
bitter person is rude to someone else.

Most importantly, wake up, smile
and please get up in the morning on
the-right side of the bed. After all,
life isn’t so bad, is it?

Soviet missiles, a balance of sorts
would be obtained. This would
enhance stability.

Because of its accuracy, however,
the Soviets perceive the MX as a
first-strike, not a retaliatory, wea-
pon. The weapon reduces stability
because it creates a tempting target
for the Soviets, were a crisis to
occur. They might-attempt to strike
it first, before it can strike them.

An arms buildup, as the Reagan
Adminstratrion has shown, can
enhance stability in the short run
through the perception and projec-
tion of power. But in the long run,
the Soviets will respond and insta-
bility will rear its ugly and danger-
ous head once more.

To enhance stability and to con-
trol the arms buildups, if not the
arms races, the superpowers have
tried a second method — arms
control.

Arms control has been a complete
failure. It represents a political
rather than a militaristic approach
to the stability problem. It is an
effort to negotiate stability through
compromise and conciliation.
Ideally, arms control occurs in an
atmosphere of cooperation in the
pursuit of mutual interests — reduc-
ing nuclear arms and controlling the
dangerously competitive nature of

From Where I Stand

Tim Hunter

Live and Let?

Last year, The Pittsburgh Press
reported a story about a woman’s
baby daughter who was eaten by
their pet dog. The story -explained
that this woman was not very upset
about this incident. She was upset
when the authorities wanted to kill
the dog. She explained that she
could always have another child, but
she could never get another dog like
her present one. This woman’s indif-
ferent attitude about the life of her
child is the same attitude of those
who feel that killing a child in the
womb is not murder. ,

Abortion is murder because the
fetus is a person. Personhood, ifyou
will, is designated by an organisms’s
potential to be a person. The fertil-
ized egg ofahuman has the potential
to be a person; thus, it is a person.
And of course killing a person is
wrong. If personhood were desig-
nated by, say, the amount of devel-
opment of an organism, then the
only time that organism could be
considered a full person would be
when it is fully developed. Humans
are fully developed around the age
of 21. Should we be allowed to kill
undesirable persons up until their
twenty-first birthday? How about
conferring personhood when the
organism has the abilityto survive
on its own? I’d say that is probably
around the age of 12 years. It seems
rather obvious that there really is no
age limit, outside or inside of the
womb, to determine personhood.
Thus, the moment‘ of conception is
the only choice.

Still, there are those who take the
above argument with a grain of salt
since it is not written down in the law

the superpower relationship.

Four main; accords have been
signed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
Only one remains in force today.
The other three — SALT I, Vladi-
vostok, SALT ll - did nothing
more than set upper limits on the
superpowers’ nuclear arsenals. The
limits were usually higher than the
actual numbers of weapons in the
superpowers’ stockpiles. As such,
the treaties created an incentive to
arms race. If one side did not build
up to its permitted limits, it could be
sure that the other side would.

Moreover, as the '70s progressed,
it became clear that successful nego-
tiations were contingent on some
form of superpower detente. Rela-
tions hit bottom during the first
Reagan administration and talks
were abandoned altogether. The
situation has become increasingly
viewed as unstable.

Thus, neither arms building nor
arms control has adequately led to
stability in the superpower relation-
ship.. There may be another way
which will work, however —- the
subject of part two. '

three-part series on arms and arms
control that shall run throughout
this week.) I

books. So how about this angle: It
can’t be proven that abortion is
murder (that is, as of right now) but
it also can't be proven that it is not.
John Hinckley was sentenced to a
psychiatric hospital rather than pri-
son because he could not be proven
guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Fetuses are not guilty beyond rea-
sonable doubt of not being humans,
so why are they put to death?

Regardless of the above informa— I

tion, some may continue to maintain
that a person who conceives because
of rape or for some similar reason
should be allowed to have an abor-
tion; she shouldn’t have to carry the
child of a rape for nine months. The
truth of this matter is there have
been no studies whatsover according
to researchers at Pitt’s medical
school _that claim a mother will
undergo more psychological stress
by putting the child up for adoption
than she would if she had an abor-
tion. People who claim it’s better for
the rape victim to have the abortion

base that claim on their own intui- ,

tion and nothing more. My intuition
leads me to believe that tln: mother
should put the child up for adoption
because the abortion would make
her guilty of murder; more stress
would arise from killing the child
than by letting him or her live.

All things considered, there is one
circumstance in which an abortion,
or what may seem to beanabortion,
is suitable. This, of course, is when
the mother’s life is threatened by the
pregnancy. This situation is differ-
ent because the child’s death is the
result of trying to save the mother’s
life, not trying to kill the child. It's
not that the mother’s life is more
important; the physician must try to
save both lives, but sometimes that's
impossible — especially if the fetus is
not yet fully developed.

Finally, there is the argument that

making abortions illegal will not '

decrease the number of abortions
since making it legal did not increase
their number. Consider this: Since
the legalization of abortion in I973,
there have been over I5 million
babies killed; that is about fourteen
million more deaths thanall of those
resulting from every war in which
the U.S. has ever been involved,
from the Revolutionary War to
Vietnam. Also, according to an arti-‘
cle in Newsweek (Jan. I4, I985), the
number of abortions in the U.S. has

‘nearly tripled since I973, and they

have increased almost steadily each
year. With these ﬁgures in mind, the
argument that legalization of abor-
tion does not increase the number of
abortions just doesn't hold water.
tions just doesn’t hold water.

Abortion is not an act that should
be left up to the discretion of the
mother; it is not a political issue that
should be debated. It most certainly
is not a form of contraception.
Abortion is an act of murder. All
arguments to the contrary are just,
malarkey.

Evaluations cause of first
problem for 1985 board

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

The 1985 Student Government
Board ran into their first official
snag as they started their term with
an initial meeting Wednesday. The
board’s plan for self-evaluation
became the subject of a dispute
between various committee chair-
men and members of the board.

Student Relations Committee
Chairman Bob Kramer said that
although he was aware that evalua-
tions are necessary to point out both
strengths and weaknesses in each
committee, he had negative feelings
toward the format of the evalua-
tions. He also expressed concern
over the handing out of the
evaluations.

“We need to sit down in a round-
table discussion, I think, and be a
little bit more personable about
things."

Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, added, “We [the Election, Affir-

The Pitt News

Rowena V. Cube, who was struck
by a Port Authority Transit bus on
Sept. 18, 1984, has filed a $20,000
suit in Allegheny County Court. A
resident of Somerset, Pa., she has
returned to classes after missing the
fall term while recovering from her
injuries. The suit was filed against
the Port Authority of Allegheny
County and Theresa Gorman,
operator of the vehicle.

Cube has alleged in separate

mittees] appreciate the fact that you
[the board] want to know what’s
going on in evaluating. The things
we are upset about are the imper-
sonal way in which it [the evalua-
tion]_was done and some of the
insulting questions that were on the
evaluation."

Board member Avery Abrams
said that he felt that a public meeting
was neither the time nor theiplace to
bring such grievances to ‘light. ‘‘I
think to bring this up in public at the
first meeting is in poor taste and
serves no purpose.” ' '

Agreeing with Abrams were
board members Pete Petropoulos
and Jim Mumma.

In response, Leopold said, “Ifyou
consider this poor taste, we consider
the manner in which the evaluations
were handed out and your going
away for the weekend in poor taste.”

The SGB president. avoided
further arguments by choosing to
move on to other committee reports.

-— The board decided that the matter
would be taken care of in a private
meeting with the committees.

In new business, Abrams intro-
duced a resolution concerning the
divestment of all university funds
invested in corporations involved in
South African business. The com-

counts against PAT and Gorman
that she has suffered and will suffer
severe physical and emotional pain,
a loss of earnings and a permanent
impairment of her earning capaci’._
Each count requests judgement in a
sum in excess
pre-judgement interest-end costs.

Cube was injured when she
stepped into the bus lane in front of
the William Pitt Union on Fifth
Avenue. She was hit by the right
front end of the bus, thrown to the
ground and run over by the rear
wheels. At the time of the accident,
Gorman had been an employee of
PAT for eight years. ‘

The victim sustained severe
injuries to the head, neck, face,

of $10,000 plus _

plete SGB proposal for divestment
will be presented to the Student
Affairs Committee of the board of
trustees on Feb. 13.

Board member Dan Taylor pro-

posed the idea of an Office of Stu- -

dent Activities boycott of all
entertainers who have recently per-
formed in South Africa. The board
passed the proposal, agreeing that
they wanted the university to take
them seriously on the subject of
divestment. 

A ruling was also passed to table
the new Affirmative Action Com-
mittee’s bylaws indefinitely due to a
lack of agreement on them between
the board and chairman Jackie
Jackson. '

This year's liaisons between the
board and various student groups
were also named at the meeting.
Serving as liaisons are: Pete Petro-
poulos, Engineering Student Coun-
cil; Greg Cederlof, Nursing Student
Organization; Lisa Douds, Panhel-
lenic Association; Jim Mumma,
Interfraternity Council; Karen
Frost, Interhonorary Council;
Avery Abrams, Student American
Pharmaceutical Association; Mike
Ryan, Resident Student Associa-
tion; and Dan Taylor, Black Action
Society and Commuter Association.

' t
chest, and both arms and legs.

David Moran, representative of
the law firm hired by Cube, said that
the suit “has just been filed”and that
they are awaiting a reaction from
PAT.

Joseph Edgar, representative of
PAT media relations, described the
case as confidential and would not
say whether the case would be
settled out of court or taken on by
PAT’s ‘lawyers. He would not
comment on how soon or if the case
would be pursued.

Cube said that the decision to file
the complaint was her own but
would not explain her reasons for
filing. Gorman was not available for
comment.

- More Ethiopians die

Ethiopia (UPI) —— The New York
Times said officials believe at least
2,000 Ethiopian Jews have died of
malnutrition and measles in refugee
camps in Eastern Sudan since Israel
halted its secret airlift. The paper
said another 2,000 refugees have
been stranded since beginning an
exodus from their drought-stricken
homeland. About l0,000 of the

Pop festival closes

RIO DE JANEIRO (UPI) — The
huge “Rock in Rio" pop festival
drew to a muddy close in Brazil yes-
terday. Some one million fans
attended the party-like festival with
2,000 at the final concert to hear Yes,
the B-52s and Nina Hagen-.

They ignored a persistent rain that
created ankle-deep mud. However,
festival organizers accused gate-

, keepers and police of taking payoffs

to let people in without tickets.
There was plenty ofdrinking but few
problems with drug abuse.

Israelis fear bloodshed

LEBANON (UPI) — Officials in
Lebanon are cheering now that
Israeli troops are pulling out of
southern Lebanon. But they fear the
withdrawal could lead to more
bloodshed.

Religious and military leaders are
appealing for calm. The first stage of
the three-part pullback began yes-
terday with Israeli support teams
leaving the Lebanese port city of
Sidon.

In the Shouf Mountains yester-
day, Druze Moslem militiamen and
Lebanese army units battled late
into the evening. That so-called
“mountain war" has been dragging
on for more than one year. It
erupted only hours after Israeli
troops withdrew from the area in
September I983.

And in other fighting, Druze
artillery fire rained down on Chris-
tian residential areas around Beirut
yesterday. The Christian “Voice of
Lebanon” radio said five people
were killed, including an ll-month-
old baby.

Reagan inaugurated

WASHINGTON (UPI) -— Presi-
dent Reagan recited the 35-word
Oath of Office to begin his second
term yesterday. Family members
and close friends were on hand to
witness the brief ceremony on a
stairway in the White House. It was
also carried live to a nationwide
broadcast audience.

Reagan, the nation’s oldest presi-
dent at 73. placed his hand on his
mother’s Bible and recited the oath
first sworn by George Washington
in 1789.

With wife Nancy holding the
Bible, Reagan was led by ChiefJus-
tice Warren Berger in the oath — “I,
Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute the
office of president of the United
States and will, to the best of my
ability, preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United
States, so help me, God.”

Two minutes before Reagan was
sworn in, Vice President Bush took
his oath, led by retired Supreme
Court Justice Potter Stewart while
Barbara Bushheld a different Bible.

Bush was sworn in at ll:55 a.m.,
Washington time, Reagan at ll:57.

After shaking hands with Berger,
Reagan leaned toward his wife,
Nancy, and said in a voice overheard

by the microphones, “I’m going to

kiss you now,” and proceeded to do
so. _
After the ceremonies, the presi-

Newsbriefs.

dent and vice president, without
coats, walked out the front door of
the White House into the subfreez-
ing temperatures for a brief picture
ceremony.

Cold dangers citrus crop

Florida (UPI) — Citrus workers
in central Florida trudged into
groves today to try and protect Flor-
ida’s billion-dollar industry from the
cold. Forecasters expect the temper-
ature to dip below 20 degrees in the
Florida citrus belt tonight. Workers
are preparing for the worst by irri-
gating and flooding groves with
warm water to keep ground temper-
atures above freezingand create a
warm fog.

Steroid usage reported

(UPI) — A Greenville, South
Carolina newspaper reported that
coaches at Clemson University gave
steroids to football players. The arti-
cle also claimed the coaches
accepted, payment from track ath-
letes for the prescription drug.

Former assistant strength coach
Jack Harkness said he was told to
dispense the drugs by the strength
coach, Sam Colson. Harkness
reportedly gave steroids to four uni-
dentified Clemson linemen during
the spring and to another one last
fall.

LCB faces review

HARRISBURG, Pa. (UPI) ~
Governor Thornburgh said he’s con-

state’s liquor system. That’s because
the Liquor Control Board faces a
“Sunset” review in ‘the legislature.
The review means lawmakers must
dggide whether the board continues

said he thinks most Pennsylvanians

temperatures and blowing and drift-
ing snow have made driving
extremely hazardous. .A winter

Church services, Sunday school

Roads appear to be dry in most

Education dying in Third  Wor1d

By Sonja Alexander
The Pitt News .

‘ Education, a topic that hits home
to those of us at Pitt, is a major
concern in numerous undeveloped
Third World countries. With this
concern in mind, the University of
Pittsburgh’s School of Education, in
celebrating its 75th anniversary,
held a lecture by Ingvar Werdelin,
foundation professor of education

SAY BROOK

at Sweden’s Linkoping University.
Werdelin’s lecture covered the
problems that occur in the educa-
tional systems of undeveloped coun-
tries. Some examples that Werdelin
cited were the lack offunds, supplies
and properly trained teachers.
According to Werdelin, a high per-
centage of children drop out of
primary schools due to economic
and social conditions. For example,
in Bangladesh 80 percent ofchildren
enrolled in primary school drop out

1 I
95%

COURT

between the first and second grades.
“A hungry child does poorly in
school,” Werdelin said. ,

Solutions to the problems that
education faces in Third World
countries, Werdelin feels, must be
found. Perhaps an organization
within such countries would be best
suited to deal with the problems,
Werdelin said. Outside countries,
such as the U.S., could provide
international aid for supplies and
training.

Pitt gymnasts

D By Jace Palmer

The Pitt News

The men’s gymnastic team
entered the James Madison Invita-
tional this past Friday with an over-
all record of 0-2. As of Saturday
night they are now 5-3.

Said head coach Frank D’Amico,
“In my opinion, we had a completely
different team out there this week-
end. The majority of our previous
mistakes were taken away, as our
ability to hit our routines indicates.”

Just hitting routines is an under-
statement of what the squad actually
demonstrated. The Panthers won
the last three events and dominated
the finals after being neck-and-neck

with five other teams most of the ’

way. The result was a second-place
finish, a mere point behind Georgia.
The path to second place was no
easy one for Pitt, which had cast
aside Navy, Kent State, North
Carolina, William and Mary and
James Madison to get there.
D’Amico feels the results could have
been quite different if the judging
would have been more consistent.
“The judging could have been bet-
ter,” D’Amico stated. “Early on, we
were hit hard by judges on our
power horse routines  that's where
we lost it. If I had known it then, I

might have protested a few of the"

scores.”
Nevertheless, it was the superb

overall performance from the squad. "'
_ With All-East performer

‘Mark
Klafter back in action, it seemed as if
the Panthers could do no wrong.

“Our guys demonstrated a great
team effort,” said Klafter. “We
maintained our intensity through-
out the two days. I think this is the
earliest in a season a Pitt team has
ever reached the 265-point mark."

Having only one week to prepare
didn't seem to hinder Klafter’s per-
formance, however. “I basically
went with some older routines,” he
said, “I still haven’t gotten my
strength up to where it should be,
though  my whole meet ran on
adrenalin.”

Strength or no strength, Klafter
won three individual events, includ-
ing the floor exercise (9.65) and
parallel bars (9.40), but thinks his
support of the other gymnasts over-
shadowedhis own efforts.

The parallel and high bars are
Pitt’s forte, many times actually
deciding their meets. “We count on
these two events,” D’Amico stated,
adding, “Our weekend performance
on the bars was the way I always
dreamed it could be. I was very
pleased.”

In addition to Klafter, it wasalso
a big meet for junior All-East per-
former Matt Peters and freshman
Jorge Sanchez. Out of 20 gymnasts,
Peters took first in the all-around
competition with a score of 54 while
Sanchez placed an overall seventh.
Peters stood out in the high bar
finals, accumulating a 9.7 score
while bringing the audience to a
standing ovation. Sanchez, the
highly recruited high school gym-
nast, made ﬁnals in four events,

although a previous groin pull kept _

him out of two.

D’Amico accredited the results to
an overall team effort. “It’s hard to
give credit to any one person,” he
said. “Mark’s [Klafter] presence was
a big boost, though. With a little
more effort we could easily make the
270 mark.” '

Giving credit to one person would
definitely be a mistake. In addition
to Klafter, Peters and Sanchez,

with Western Michigan. D’Amico
feels the bars will be the key. “It’s
going to be tough. Kent State has a
good squad and Western Michigan
beat us a week ago. In terms of con-
ditioning, the bars are one of the
easier events to compete in, but
we’re finally starting to come

Senior forward Bill Martin
echoed Jackson’s comments:
“Coach Thompson told us at half-
time to be patient. We were a bit
tentative in the first half, so wejust
started looking for our shots a little
more in the second half.”

The I-loyas went from tentative to
aggressive in the second half.
Georgetown took advantage of the
loss of Aiken to grab a lead they
would never relinquish. “That‘s
what basketball is all about —- tak-
ing the opportunities the opposition
gives you," Ewing said. “We did that
better in the second half than we did
in the first half.”

SO

dicament that Aiken had been in
only moments before. Georgetown’s
man-to-man defense began to give
the Panthers trouble in getting the
ball inbounds. The absence of
Smith, who sat momentarily after
picking up his fourth personal foul,
left Pitt with no tall player to whom
to toss the ball. Chipman brought
Smith back in after the last of several
five-second violations that resulted
in Georgetown buckets.

Commentary: Pitt played even
ball for most ofthe afternoon. Inex-
perience and lack of depth seemed to
be the greatest weaknesses in the Pitt
program, but there were two facts
that were evident from the game.
First, Georgetown is not unbeata-
ble. The Hoyas committed 21 tur-
novers, and about 70 percent of

great?

those were traveling calls, not gener-
ally considered to be seen in such
detail by the No. l team in the
nation. Granted, the Big East con-
ference may have the best team in
the nation, but that team may play
its home games in Jamaica, New
York.

The second fact is that there will
be a definite power change in the Big
East within the next few years. Look
for Georgetown’s program to recede
much the same way UCLA did after
the Bill Walton era. Charles Smith
will become one of the dominant
players in the conference within the
next few years, along with Walter
Berry of St. John’s.

One final note: St John’s plays at
Georgetown this Saturday; bet the
rent on St. John’s.

Coach Donna Sanft said after the
meet: “We were ahead of West Virgi-
niavuntil the last event. It came down
to the floor [exercise], and‘ we lost
it.” West Virginia scored three
points more than Pitt and won that
event.

Alisa Spector, Pitt’s leading
scorer in the all-around, was unable
to compete in the meet due to a groin
injury. “I was disappointed that I
couldn’t compete, but the alternates

“They didn’t even know they would

“We were expecting West Virginia

Maryland was a surprise," Sanft

A few‘ of the individual high
points for the team were Kristy Piet-
ers‘ finishing third in the all-around
and Beth Waters’ second-place fin-

that with a first-place finish in the

Swimmers defeat Clarion

‘or

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

Moving another step closer to
their goal of an undefeated season,
the Pitt women’s swimming and div-
ing team increased their record to
6-0 after defeating Clarion State 89-
5|.

Saturday's meet at Clarion had
more significance than just another
slash in the win column ‘for the
Panthers. It gave Coach David Belo-
wich the opportunity to break away
from the team’s usual lineup in
competition.

“We had the chance to gain some
experience in events that we nor-
mally don’t swim but that we’ll have

to face in the championship part of"

the season,” said Belowich.

One race that offered that kind of
experience was the 1,650-meter
freestyle in which Sue Heon took
first place and freshman Marian
Cassidy placed second.

“We want to get in at least one, if
not two, l,650s before the Big East
championship. It’s important
because it requires different training
than the 1,000-meter freestyle,
which is what we usually swim in its
place,” Belowich explained.

According to Belowich, Heon,
who is one of the best distance frees-
tylers in the world, had no competi-
tion in that race. “In that event, there
was no question of who was going to
win. Sue sets the pace and everyone
else tries to catch up.”

Cassidy, who took second, came
within eight seconds of her best time
in that event. She then went on to

Georgetown not so great?

By Jim (lrban
The Pitt News

Pitt camel painfully close to
knocking off the top—ranked Hoyas‘
of Georgetown on Saturday at the
Civic Arena.

Coach Roy Chipman’s squad put
on a performance that was worthy of
a victory but fell just short. It was a
case of the better team winning.
Georgetown used its depth and
experienceto pull away from the

V Panthers in the second half.

Pitt led for most of the first half
until the Hoyas’ David Wingate
made a steal with 4:53 remaining
and converted to give Georgetown
its first lead at 20-18.

What followed was a Michael
Jackson jumper and four nasty
dunks, two by Pitt’s Charles Smith,
and one each by Georgetown’s Pat
Ewing and Pitt’s Keith Armstrong.
This exchange left the score knotted
24-24 at the intermission.

Georgetown was neither surprised
nor shaken by the halftime score.

Jackson, a point guard, came out in
the second half and did everything
but moonwalk. After Pitt’s Curtis
Aiken picked up his fourth personal
foul with just over three minutes
expired in the second half, Jackson
and the Hoyas cut loose. Chipman
was forced to replace Aiken with
Charles Thompson.

“Curtis’ fourth foul really hurt
us,” said Chipman. “It took away a
lot of the things we were trying to
do.” Georgetown coach John
Thompson agreed: “Anytime you
get a key player in trouble it hurts,
particularly against us with a back-
court player. It had to have an
effect.” The Hoyas seized the
opportunity.

In Aiken’s absence, the Hoyas
stretched their lead from two to 10‘
points. Jackson felt the Panthers
were running out of gas. “I think
early in the second half that our
press had finally begun to wear them

down,” said Jackson. “We.knew it ’

would be a tough game, so we didn’t
panic at halftime."

about a three-minute rest between
events, Cassidy added another first-
place swim to her list of contribu-
tions for the day when she swam the
500-meter freestyle in a time of
509.80.

Judy Haughton was on Belo-
wich’s list of stars for the meet.
Haughton, who has a history of ten-
donitis in her shoulders, was not
only part of the victorious medley
relay team but came back to win the
200-meter butterﬂy and take second
in the I00-meter butterfly, despite
the pain in her shoulders.

“Judy had a good day. She did a
fine job in dealing with and over-

coming her pain,” Belowich said.‘

“The 100 ‘fly was the closest race of
the year. Judy gave it her all coming
in second by only one-hundredth of
a second.”

Freshman Michelle Ranck scored’

in two events for the first time since
joining the squad. She took third in
the 100 and 200 butterﬂy. “A lot of
young swimmers scored fof the first
time. Michelle is steadily moving
forward on the team,” Belowich
said.

In the diving competition, Tricia
Ney took first place on. the one-
meter board with a score of 229.32
points. Jennifer Brown placed first
in the three-meter competition with
a score of 229.95, while Ney took
second place with a score of 216.30.
' The team was able to wrap up the
meet with victories in the last two

events. In the 400-meter individual,
medley, Heon took first place and-

Jodi O’Neil took second.

ers connected on two field goals to
the Eagles one to make the score
51-47 with 34 seconds remaining.
Ann Odoy, the Eagles 5'5” freshman
point guard, then took over. She
scored on a drive down the lane and
was fouled. Odoy completed the
three-point play to bring the Eagles
to within one point at 51-50 with 29

lowing the play, Tirik was fouled on
an inbounds pass and missed the
one—on-one. B.C. pulled down the
rebound and got the ball to Odoy
and she again drove down the lane
and again she was fouled. This time,
the foul occured before the shot,
putting her at the line for a one-on-'

asked if there was any reluctance in
her mind to call the play for Collins,
coach Judy Saurer answered defini-
tively, “No way. Stephanie is a great
shooter; she just hasn’t been on
track. The play was designed for
her.”

When play resumed, Tirik
inbounded the ball to Gannis, who
got the pass into Collins at the top of

left, and with hands in her face put
up a l2-foot jumper that settled in,

Easy Win For Wrestlers

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

Although the Pitt wrestlers
defeated Youngstown decisively
46-9, their trip was somewhat

disappointing. Only three members
of the team wrestled their scheduled
bouts due to injuries that
incapacitated the Penguins.

“Wheniwe spoke to Youngstown’s
coach earlier in the week, we were
under the impression that they
would wrestle at least six bouts,”
explained head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “And even though we
were disappointed that more men
weren’t able to wrestle, for the few
guys that did compete the trip was
worth it.”

Those wrestlers able to compete
included John Hnath, Ken
Hackman and Mike Tongel. Hnath
defeated his opponent at 126 lbs.,
Dom Mancini, by a score of 14-3. At
177 lbs., Panther Ken Hackman fell

to Aquino Morales in a close 6-4
bout. Tongel was able to record 16
points over competitor Tim Trepa,
which gave him a technical fall.

“We were quite pleased with
.Iohnnie’s [Hnath] performance, and
Tongel did a real nice job,”
commented Stottlemyer. “And for
being a freshman, Ken Hackman

really puts forth a great effort. '

However, he’s still wrestling like a
high school competitor and he has to
be willing to change a few things in
order to improve his technique.”

The low’ number of wrestlers
competing in the match presented
some difficulties for the Panthers.
“It was hard for our guys to mentally
prepare themselves for their
individual bouts,” said Stottlemyer.
“lt’s not much fun when most of
your teammates aren’t competing.
But we all felt sorry for Youngstown
as well. I hope our trip offered them
some consolation in that we were
willing to make the trip, and
hopefully they’ll hang in there.”

Marino, Dolphins go down

PALO ALTO, Calif. (UPI) -
The San Fransisco 49ers defeated
the Miami Dolphins 38-16 in Super
Bowl XIX last night in Stanford
Stadium.

San Francisco quarterback Joe
Montana passed for a record 331

.yards, completing 24 of .35 passes

and throwing for three touchdowns.
Montana, a product of Monongahe-
la’s Ringgold High School was
named MVP of the game. But the

Notre Dame grad was not only a ~~

terror in the air but on the ground as
well. Montana rushed for a Super
Bowl record 59 yards (for a quarter-

back) in five carries with one
touchdown.

The 49er defense was in no way
overshadowed by the explosive San
Fransisco offense. Dolphin quarter-
back Dan Marino was sacked four
times and threw a pair of intercep-
tions. Previous to the game, Marino
was hauled down a total of 13 times,
and no team had more than three
sacks against Marino.

San Francisco head coach Bill
Walsh said ofthe defense: “We knew
we had a super defense and that’s
hard to beat. We were really anxious
to be world champions.” Walsh has
now won two Super Bowls since he

Ken Hackman grappled with a Mountaineer Wednesday.

DaveiHooker/ The Pm ews

took over the head coaching job in

San Fransisco ﬁve yearsoago. The.

49ers defeated the Cincinnatti Ben-
gals in the Super Bowl in 1982.

For Dolphin coach Don Shula, it
was his fifth trip to the Super Bowl.
He was beaten in his last trip to the
game two years ago when the D01-
phins fell to the Washington
Redskins.

For Pitt's Dan Marino, the game
was a disappointing end to a bril-
liant season. Said Marino, “I’d like
tohave another chance. We had a
great year but it really hurts that we
can't be world champs.”

Hockey 2
games iced

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
was left unexpectedly idle this
past week due to two cancella-
tions and a win by. forfeit over
Wheeling that raised the Pan-
thers’ record to 9-2-1. The skat-
ers were prepared for some tough
weekend competition with Gan-
non and Slippery Rock, but both
games were cancelled because of
inclimate weather conditions.

The Panthers were ready and
willing to avenge their first loss,
which Gannon handed them
early in the season. However,
Erie, with snow rivaling Antarc-
tica’_s, was three feet under and
nothing short of Santa and his
reindeer could have pulled the
Gannon team through to con-
tend with the Panthers oh Satur-
day at Lakevue. This game has
been rescheduled for next Satur-
day at 2 p.m.

Yesterday’s game at Slippery
Rock was also postponed due to
dangerously cold sub-zero
temperatures at the Meadville
outdoor ice arena. This game has

not been rescheduled as of today.

Too little, too late for Lady Hoopers

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team
dropped a tough, 73-67 decision to
St. John‘s Saturday at the field
house. Coach Judy Saurer‘s squad

' fought back from a I5-point deficit
early in the second half, only to
come up short in the end.

Coach Joe Mullaney Jr.‘s quick
St. .Iohn’s team built its lead
throughout the~first half, taking
advantage of II Pitt turnovers. The
Express produced a balanced lineup
of scoring: Nine different players
scored in the first half and the team
shot an incredible 63 percent from
the field.

Pitt came out after the half and
began to erode the Express’ lead ever
so slowly. Saurer started a smaller
_lineup in an attempt to counter the
quickness of St. John's.

St. John’s guard Faye Gerald gave
the Panthers all they could handle.
The senior from Pleasantville, New
Jersey, scored 20 points and added

six assists and seemed to come up
with the clutch play every time Pitt
grew close.

It wasn’t as if Pitt didn’t have its
chances, however. The Panthers
could have taken the lead when
sophomore Jane Plake stepped to
the foul line for a one-and-one with
26 seconds remaining and Pitt down
by one, 68-67. Plake missedshort

One-point loss in BC]

Panthers ventured to Boston Col-
lege to play the Lady Eagles ( l0-5) at
Roberts Center, and the first half
was exactly that — a venture.
Twenty minutes into the game, the
Panthers were down by a scoreof
19-17. Both teams even made an

adventure out of common ﬁeld goal 1

attempts as Pitt shot 29 percent from
the field and Boston College

checked in at an even more dismal 26
percent. The teams combined for I9
fouls and 2l turnovers. Pitt was hurt
when leading scorer Jennifer Bruce
was slapped with her third personal
foul with 12 minutes remaining in
the half and had to sit out the last
nine minutes with two points to her
credit.

Furthermore, the Lady Eagles
frustrated the Panthers in the first
half with a deliberate offense and
cross-court passing on which guards
Lisa Fubio and Kim Tirik normally
feast. 1

“I thought we did a decentjob on

V defense in the first half, but we could

have anticipated their cross-court
passes a little better,” said assistant
coach Carol Dugan. “In the second
half, we went to our I-2-I-I press

and then droped. back. into a. 2-3 .

It would have been a sinkhole had
the Panthers not gotten the produc-
tion they did from Armstrong,
second only to Smith with ll points.
Chipman benched the junior center
during the second half ‘Monday
night after zero productionion the
boards.

Against the H oyas he muscled out
eight rebounds, a figure matched
only by Ewing. “I came out with
confidence, and I knew what to
expect,” Armstrong said. “No sur-
prise, I know*what [Ewing] does."

“He was a presence on the court,”
Chipman added. “And Georgetown
noticed that. That’s all we asked of
him."

The anticipated Ewing-Matt Mik-
lasevich matchup never honestly
materialized, as Armstrong tallied
37 minutes before fouling out.

Like Armstrong, the other Pan-
thers, having been highly read ofthe
Hoya methodology, faced George-
town .as they would a Brooklyn
asphalt team.

“I think Patrick is very good at
intimidation,” Aiken said, “but I
don’t think any of the other players
can do that. When they had Gene
Smith and all those other players,
they were all over you. But [today] I
didn’t feel intimidated."

lt’s easy when turning a blind eye
toward those Darth Vader warmup
suits.

Off the Boards: Pitt faces Boston
College in Chestnut Hill tonight at 8
p.m. at Roberts Center. The Eagles
are the only Big East team the

Panthers have yet to defeat in con-'

ference play.

Georgetown tempered its high
turnover rate (I5) in the first half to
finish with 21 overall. It had com-
mitted 24 in the first half against
Villanova last Saturday. ‘

Armstrong wasn’t the only one to
foul out as forward Bill Martin also
left early after scoring nine points.

Aiken led Pitt with four assists,
Michael Jackson five for
Georgetown.

Perhaps the Hoyas’ biggest test
comes Saturday, 2:30 p.m. tipoff,
when St. John’s visits the Capital
Centre. Georgetown’s last loss came
Feb. 25, I984, when the Redmen
scored a 75-71 upset - in Landover,

Panthers can’t hang on, lose in second half

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

So quickly were they beyond
striking distance that original plans
to at least stay within rearview mir-
ror distance were ditched.

Taking advantage of wide open
passing lanes, not to mention l5 gift
turnovers, the Panthers built and
sustained enough first-half leads to
suspend Georgetown’s voluminous
winning streak. Such was their prog-

, ress through 20 minutes on Saturday

afternoon, leading to a 24-24 dead-
lock at intermission.

An estimated 16,532 fans continu-
ally craned their necks toward some-
where in the middle of the Civic
Arena galaxy. A scoreboard there
confirmed the on-court doings. A
Star Wars defense failed to effec-
tively contain the enemy.

Twenty minutes of a basketball
game still remained, enough time for
the Hoyas to illustrate that the coro-
nation of great college teams is
based on a full 40 minutes of play.
That’s all Georgetown needed to
hand Pitt (9-5, l-3) its third straight
loss 65-53.

It follows that Georgetown now
stands 17-0, 6-0 with 28 straight
wins. After a stinging 31-point loss
several nights before, though, the
Panthers did not talk of losing.

“We wanted to go ahead like any
other team and tried to stay with
them,” said a new-found Keith Arm-
strong. “Otherwise you have an even
worse chance of beating them, but
nobody’s disappointed.” *

“We were playing 40 minutes,
playing, I should say, against a
genius on the sidelines,” said Curtis
Aiken, no less the Panthers’ master-

mind than Hoyas coach John
Thompson.

It was Aiken — Pitt’s mercurial
point guard -— who guided the

Panthers even with and beyond
Georgetown, giving a non-ranked
team the best chance in nearly one
year of spearing and immobilizing
the defending national champions.
Except for one first-half minute,
Aiken was spearheading the Pan-
thers, whether heaving an alley-oop
to forward Charles Smith or weav-
ing needle-like through a not-so-
suffocating Hoya defense.

“We were trying to control the
tempo of the game," Coach Roy
Chipman said of a first half where
the Hoyas held only four short-lived
advantages. “We knew if we got in a
running game with them, they would
blow us out.”

“We had been working the ball
around, wanting to take time off the
shot clock,” said Joey David, start-
ing his first game in five weeks
alongside Aiken. “Coach didn’t
want the ball going up from 17 feet.
A lot of times in the beginning we
were open from that far, but we
knew we had to wear [Georgetown]
down.”

“At the beginning, we had trouble
getting started,” Hoya coach
Thompson stated. “I attribute that
to Pitt’s defense.”

Just as attributable to the Pan-
thers’ downfall was the loss -— albeit
for only 3:54 u of Aiken, who
fouled for the fourth time only three

Almost

to St. John’s.

Wendy Isaacman/ The Pitt News

Pitt defense smothers Georgetown’s Reggie Williams. The Hoyas played a strong second half and won 65-53.

-——-Press Box

The Pitt women’s basketball team made a second-
half comeback, but it was not enough as they lost

minutes into the second half. Sud-
denly a 32-30 deficit became a40-30
game with 12: ll remaining, Pittable
to counter 12 Georgetown points
with only two in three-and-a-half
minutes time.

“Curtis’ fourth foul really hurt
us,” Chipman said. “It took away a
lot of the things we were trying to
do.”

“Any time a key basketball player
is in foul difficulty, especially a
backcourt man, and in a game like
ours, it’s not just how he plays but
what he represents to the team,”
Thompson said. “It had to affect
Pitt.”

It also affected the Hoyas, who
were led by the combined forces of
7-0 All-America center Patrick
Ewing and David Wingate, each
scoring 18 points. .

“At halftime, I was talking sweet
to [the players],’’ Thompson said,
leaving to assumption that it usually
isn’t that way after his team shoots
47.8 percent — matched‘by Pitt — in
one half. “I asked them how they felt
about that. And they have that quiet
confidence. When the image, the
pressure from the outside that you’re
a super team is given, there’s the
impression you’re doing something
terribly bad, especially when you’re
tied at halftime.”

After that, the Hoyas clamped
down, shooting 52 percent the rest of
the way as Pitt declined to 39 before
finishing with 43.1 compared to
Georgetown’s even 50. Any final

Thompson tops court

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Career record: 277-I04

Winning percentage: 72.7

Number of years coaching: l3 .
Season record: l7-0, 6-0 in the Big
East

Status of team: defending national
champion, ranked No. I inthe coun-
try in the AP and UPI polls

These are some of the imposing
facts about head coach John
Thompson and his Georgetown
team, who defeated Pitt 65-53 Satur-
day at the Civic Arena.

The Panthers
which began in I91 I, 14-12, but have
not beaten the Hoyas since the ’82-
83 season. The style with which
Georgetown has dispatched all of its
opponents thus far does not indicate
a likely Pitt dominance in the near
future. A significant part ofthe rea-
son is Thompson;

Six.-two Hoya guard Michael
Jackson (who wears two gloves if
any) compared playing for Thomp-

‘ son to preparing for life because “if

you're late for practice, you’re in
trouble because it’s like being late
for work."

Jackson,
points,

who collected
five assists

eight
and four

lead the series,

rebounds for the Hoyas, said his
coach “treats us like a friend. Coach
Thompson respects us and we
respect him.”

Thompson’s players are not alone
in their respect for him; Georgetown
is universally accepted as being the
team to beat in ’85. This acceptance
walks hand-in-hand with the inevit-
ability of pressure, the expectation
that this team can do it all again. Lo
and behold, they have.

No one has stopped the Hoyas yet
in their quest for a second consecu-

.tive NCAA championship, although

Pitt kept even with the visitors
through much of Saturday‘s game.

“We had a difficult time getting
started, and I attribute that to Pitt’s
defense,” Thompson remarked. The
Hoya coach made his stand on
defense very clear before the Big
East games even began. “People ask
if I emphasize defense. I don't know
of anybody who wins who doesn’t
emphasize defense,” Thompson
said.

Thompson stated that defense
played a big role in the closeness of
the game, which was tied at 24 at
halftime. “A lot of credit goes to
Pitt,” Thompson said. “They dis-
rupted our offense. They got their
hands on a Lot of balls.”

Nevertheless, the equal halftime
score -- both teams shot I l of 23 --
raised a few eyebrows and a few
questions about the game that was

expected to be a blowout before the
sellout crowd. Thompson‘ waved
those questions away. ,

“When you’re considered a very
good team, you’re expected to go up
I5 points and be supermen,” he
explained, adding that it doesn't
always happen that way. “They [his
players] are learning this very well.

“There are different kinds ofpres-
sure. The point spread during the
game becomes the pressure. You feel
like you’re letting yourselves and the
world down when you’re tied at half-
time. There’s a different standard of
evaluation.”

The Hoyas pulled together and
pulled away early in the second half
behind Patrick Ewing’s flying slams
and an aggressive defense that pro-
duced a quick surge of points that
Pitt could not recapitulate.

Thompson said that the arena’s
atmosphere is conducive to great
performances and appropriate for
the conference. “This is what it
should be,” he asserted. “The Big
East is supposed to be the big
arena.”

The coach added that it was good
preparation for the national tourna-
ment in March. “You get in those
mammoth places and you get

gstagestruck."

It‘s a stage Georgetown has per-
formed on before and a part that
many people expect the team to play
again.
