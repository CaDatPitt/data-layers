All Are Honored

Tap Day signiﬁes various things. To those who will be
tapped to the different honoraries it means recognition for
achievements and for jobs well done. For the faculty and
administrationit signiﬁes the fulﬁllment of a job, the cul-
mination of combined efforts for a common goal. For the
studentswho do not participate it may mean nothing or

much.

But for all it should signify not the end of a job but
rather _the beginning. The students who accept honors
today are also‘-accepting a responsibility.‘ Their task has
only begun for with theadvent of Tap’Day all eyes focus
upon them asthey become recognized as leaders, men and
women who are conscientious and diligent.

' Now or later, all students of aAUniversity such as Pitt
will ﬁnd themselves without the limiting conﬁnes “of the
University walls. In a sense those who are honored today
will ﬁnd the going harder than the rest for much is ex-
pected of them. Their actions and deeds in the future,

. as at present, will be followed not only by the faculty and
administration but also by their fellow students.

Thus

Tap Day is more than just an honor -and a responsibility.
It is a trust which each tappee must carry and- fulﬁll, both
‘-here at-school and after graduation. ' — ' - ' .

" Today all may feel honored whether their names were

A L, called or not. Every member of the faculty, each'administra—
-‘tor, each student not only can but should feel justiﬁably
proud at the accomplishments of those being honored. In

school as in every other phase of life, ‘it is only through’

By Jim Dewgese
As inevitable as the proverbial
.death.and taxes is the fact that

' things become extinct and, hav-

ing left their impression in the
earth, take a ﬁnal and inﬂexible
departure from the world in

    

which we live.
We have an
‘example of

nological research and advance-

' ment accounted for the horse and

that rapidly evaporating element.

of integr_ity which was so self
~ evident in the pioneers of yester-
day? '

The pioneer" himself has been
crowded into the background by
the “yes” men and the “super”
salesmen who" throw away any

. integrity which they might have
‘possessed for the sake of ad-

vancement and money. ‘ For

many, the‘only course open is

._ one such as this; for, under our
present economic system,‘ money
is a necessity.

In the past it has been possible
‘for —a man to face his employer
or any other man and tell him
exactly what he wants with no
ifs, ands, or buts. Now the situ-
ation does not lend itself to such
conduct for a job may be at stake
and that stake may be too high to
risk losing.

L Sincerify Absent

Andrso we have the “yes”_
’man. He spends the greater part’.

of his waking day s-aying yes,

‘nodding, smiling, and catering to '

every whim of his boss. His every
resource is strained to get ahead.
Unfortunately his boss is all too
often the same type with the

Almost invariably it is the man
who is not afraid to say no that
gets to the top but too many fail
to realize this and’continue to sit
about a conference table, twirling
their unused pencils and saying
brightly, “‘yes J. ’P., of 'course
J. P., you’re absolutely right J . P.

Secretly they may be damning
J. P. for the pompous feel they
think him to be but never will

they admit this to the man who is _,
r.esponsible for their employment.

Servan1's—PubI,ic and Private

Lack of integrity is not to be
confused with professional cour-
tesy. A hired servant, for in-
stance, perforrris his tasks with
the detchment of a well built
machine. He‘ realizes that he has
chosen the job and that the job
requires the motions which he
executes. But such is the case
for the white collar worker-who
says yes only because he is afraid
to say no.

The ‘high potentate of all yes ‘

men falls in the catagory of the
politician. Here we see a man
whoapparently feels no qualms
what—so-ever a b’o u t promising

. the public any number of ﬁne

things and then forgetting ' all

about them when he has attained ‘

his goal—-public office. For him
the means have justiﬁed the end.

I Firm Foundation Needed,

But for those few who still
possess that intangible thing we

‘ call integrity such an end will

never be justiﬁed in_ the light of
the means used for its attainment.
Being friendly and agreeable has

_ nothing to do with a lack of in-

tegrity. But too frequently we
see tliese ignoble means applied
by those around us, be they
school friends or international
diplomats. '

Extinction for some things is
inevitable. If this be the case for
integrity, I fear that the human
race must follow the goony bird.
I trust only that the impressions
left in the earth by man will be

"founded on integrity which may
then serve as a foundation for an

unknown future.

“Carthy may have done some

‘,‘Yes" Man

FromlC-oocl to» Evil

By John De Ninno

Several months ago at the Big Four Conference
in Germany, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
made the following statement concerning the recog-
nition of Red China, “It is one thing to accept evil
as a fact, it is another to take it to ones breast,

and call it good.”

Although he probably did not consider or in-
tend it to be, the statement made '
by Mr_ Dulles was a good an-
alysis of the work being done by
Joseph R. McCarthy and his in-
vestigating committee.

At“ one time in his career as
chairman of the committee Mc-

good. Unfortunately this is not
only no longer true but it would
be stupid to believe ‘that, he still
is serving a usefuL purpose.

Besides being arrogant, publicity happy, radi-
cal, and a distorter of facts, the junior Senator has
managed to cause a good bit of evil while sup-
posedly doing good.

One of his major crimes is. the manner _'in
which he has boldly refused to recognize the
authority of the President not only as leader of
the nation but also as head of the Republican
Party. This has resulted in dissention within the
party‘ and a feeling of unsureness amongst some
of the people as to who is‘running the government,
Eisenhower or McCarthy. During times such_ as
these, when the nation needs to really band to-

as a personal attack upon himself. He lashed back
in a latter talk and made the remark. that he
would be the issue in this election year, despite
the fact that\President Eisenhower saidethat he

When Adlai Stevenson attacked the administra-
tion on several points McCarthy again wanted to
set himself up as the party's official representa- .
tive. However the President squelched this plan_
and Vice-President Richard Nixon deliveredfuthe
rebuttal. T .

The manner in which McCarthy distorted. the
facts in his row with Edward, R. Murrow, was
indeed masterful. After Murrow showed ﬁlms‘ on‘
his program “See It Now” of the junior Senator-V

time to answer what he termed the “smear-s”.. '

lHome ofBra

" By Vince Leonard Q

An earnest eﬁort to dramatize
the havoc which war wreaks on

men’s minds has been made at '

the Playhouse, where Arthur

'Laurent’s “Home of the Brave”

is enjoying a lengthy ‘run. The
play is a.heady, yeasty, even if
attimes a not too adroit blend-
ed, cauldron of psychiatry in
war. 1

On the Hamlet Street stage, ‘a
cast of just six men mix emotions
while cavorting around the likes
‘of an army hospital, the office of
the CO, and a tropical Paciﬁc is-
land. Here, extremely ﬁne acting
from the,» talented half-dozen
males lend ' helping hands to

the author. For in “Home,?’ it‘

was Laurents’ honest, if not
wholly successful, endeavor to
mirror to the civilian audience
the -true inwardness of war, bit-
ter ,and bloody, and spiked, in
this particular piece, with a"
poignant theme of racial discrim-
ination. A _ ’
"Glad Feeling"

Private Peter Cohen, is Jewish
and labors under the,misappre-
hension-that he is different from
the other ‘GI’s because of it.

'-When Coney experiences that

“glad feeling” when his buddy
is hot, because he himself is still
safe, the play swings nicely on
two cleverly linked pivoted
points. That is, the “glad feeling”
and the bigotry are inseparably
in his mind. But the
eventual outcome wherein Coney
is ﬁnally convinced that every
soldier has the ‘identical “glad
feeling,” is too easily expected.

Meantime, because "he was

forced to abandon his best buddy ’

as the Japs were closing in,
Coney assumes some sort of‘psy-
chological paralysis and becomes
a social recluse, hiding in the
wooden shelter of his‘ wheelchair.
It is the psychiatrist’s job, Cap-
tain Anderson, to snap him back
to his senses and out of his pseu-
do-paralysis. '
Audience Winces .
In the small hospital room, oc-
cupied by only the doctor and
the patient, realism comes front
and center. The audience winces
as the doétor hypos Coney with
a" huge’ needle.‘"The injection

the ﬁghting and name-calling.

that issues forth from a group of
men, cramped and crouched into
frustration; and, the answer is
obvious.

From his crack—up to his cure,
Coney rants with abandon,
shuttling from the hospital room:
to.the scene of battle, Edward
Komperda, as Coney, gives the
performance of the season. With
the sudden changes of pace from
limp sickness to savage ﬁghting,
Komperda _ runs the gamut of
emotions.

Casi‘ is Good

"As Doctor Beitterzer, John
Johns, veteran of‘ playhouse per-
formers, cures Coney by sheer
and harsh realism. His psy-
chiatrist _ is downright frighten-
ing at times. Stan Watt as Min-

Harry Lantz, as T.J., too old

superb. His tauntings of Coney

are priceless.

William Glennon, in his fourth
performance of the season, romps
with ease, through the role of
the boy major in charge of engi-
neers sent out to map the island
for invasion. And George Pep-
pard as Finch, .the slow, d,rawl-
ing'Arizona hick, is touchingly
pathetic.

Fred Burleigh directed with
his usual mastery, accentingthe
ﬁst-ﬁghts and “take-cov‘er”' se-'.
quences on the island. Itcan be
said that “Home of the Brave”

ticks off some ﬁne moments, of’

war and mental science; but _is
however, far from clock-work
precision.

“Two Years of Mastery
At Stake for Panthers

By STEVE BUTCHOCK .
The Pitt baseball squad entertains the West Virginia
Mountaineers in one their most crucial tests of the season
_ at ‘Mellon Park this afternoon. .
Pitt’s record now stands at four wins against three
losses, following their 11-6 lacing of Westminster at "New

Wilmington on Monday.

The past two seasons found the Panthers taking four
successive games from WVU,¢

which is a good indication that the
Mittmen may have solved the jinx
that _previously found them win-
ning only two of eleven contests-
Gridders Help WVU

Mountaineer Coach Steve Har-
rick has seen his teams compiling
an impressive 72-50 record ‘the
past six seasons, but this year he
has lost his entire inﬁeld, catcher,
two pitchers, and an outﬁelder
from _last year’s squad.

But with all these absentees, the
Mittmen will havevto be at peak
form if they expect to win from
their bitter ‘rivals. The pitching
department looks the strongest
with top—ﬂight veterans Jim Heise
and Carl”-Norman ready to go, to
say nothing about the holdover re-
serves that have been acquiring
valuable experience in early sea-
son tilts. ‘

iThe Mountaineer offensive at-T

tack will beibolstered by the ad-
dition of football players Fred
Wyant and Sam Huﬁ. Wyant,_,a
ﬁrst sacker, may have a hard time
breaking into the starting lineup
due to the h_ot hitting of Ted Tot-
ten, who at last report was the

_ , team’s leading hitter with an aver-

age of well over .300. Inﬁelder Ron
LaNeve has also joined the squad
after recovering from a knee in-

’ jury incurred in basketball.

DICK WALLNER, ’52, left a

trail of work as he whirled
throiigh a year of telephone
training. Here he recalls

the variety of his training jobs.

(Reading time: 36 seconds)

0 “And in the Commercial Department’,

   

A “Training can really be interesting. I
"found that out when I joined A.T.&T.’s
Long Lines Department after getting
 B.A.Vat Cincinnati and my M.A. at
Michigan in 752. Long Lines is the
organization specializing in Long Dis-
tan/ce communications. I wasput in the
training .program,‘ and there wasn’t a
dull minute.

“For instance, one of my jobs in the
Traﬁic Department was estimating the
exact number of calls that would be
placed in a city on Christmas Day. My
estimate was off by only 68 calls!

“Then in the Plant Department, I ' '

made a study of damage done to a certain
cable. Found out that the most damage
ocgurred in an area used by hunters.’
Some special public relations work
among hunters helped improve that ,
situation. —

I helped analyze the communication prob-
lems of one of the largest textile com-
panies—it had widespread oﬂices and

plants. The recommendations made are

now in use.
“The variety in my training has carried

over to my ‘regular job here in Cincinnati. -

My job is to see that good service is
maintained for private line customers -
pipeline and power companies, Theater

TV and the like. Every day is different.

“As far as I am concerned, I ’ve found
my career.” '

Like so many college people who have joined
the Bell System, Dick has a job he enjoys.
There are also job opportunities with other
Bell Telephone Companies, the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories, Western Electric and
Sandia Corporation. This is a good time to

him out of ac-

back, however,
to share regular _
duties -with
Johnny Jacobs
and appeared to have the inside
track on the job come 1953.

But last spring Red Dawson
thought enough of Hoffman’s pass-

for the T-quarterback slot along
with Henrry‘ Ford, Rudy Mattioli,
and Pete Neft. Whether Billy
