the university’s oldest tradition,

class of 1871 following a blister-
ing speech _by the chancellor
about the childishness of the
students. ” A

that grew on the old campus, was
given a reminder that the class
had to be spoon-fed. Since then
this accusation has been denied
with the awarding of the spoon to
the leading members of the junior

Evaluation

All action on the proposed
student-conducted evaluation
program has been stopped
temporarily.

. Last Monday, Jay Fingere_t,
sophomore senator, reported

tion concerning. cost, discontinua-
tion of the college bulletin, and
misinterpretation of purpose has
caused the evaluation to be dis-
continued in favor of a new plan,
to be formed. ,

—“Concerning the purpose, the
teacher's role as well as the hu-

» ‘morous aspects concerning it have

been overemphasized,’ causing un-
foreseen difﬁculties,” he added.

Inquiries about Scholarships
The Admissions Oﬂice will be

consulted by Tom Lohrentz, Arts

  

senator, concerning the establish-

ment of work scholarships.
Scholarships of this type

would enable students to be

exempt, from part of theirbtui-v ’

work for this - scholarship by
helping a teacher in his major"
ﬁeld. ‘ ’ "

PolioVaccine'Deve-loper
To Leave for San Diego

Dr. Jonas Salk, developeriof the polio vaccine, is going
west to establish an institute that will be limited only by th

“imagination and ingenuity” of its members.

In a statement released yesterday, Dr. Salk said: “The.

problems and ar'ea of interest

of the institute will ‘be deter?

mined by itsimembers and will not be limited except by the

limits of their imagination and in-6

genuity.

“The establishment of such an
institution upon a sufficiently ex-
tensive land area and with ade-

quate support will permit under- ‘
. takings that would not otherwise

be possible."
San Diego Interested
Salk said that when hopes for
the institution became known, he
received encouragement from San
Diego city officials who expressed
interest in establishing the in-
stitution on Torrey Pines Mesa.
“Encouragement from other
institutions in the area gave
further incentive for exploring

S ‘the possibility that a, desirable

site be found in the area of the
west coast” he added.

In his statement, Dr. Salk ex-
plained the purpose of the insti-
tute.

He said that it would be “de-
voted to the advancement of
knowledge, relevant to the health
and wel1—bein-g of _man, primarily
through research in fundamental
biology and in the cause, preven-
tion and cure of disease, and in
the factors and circumstances con-

ductive tothe fulfillment of man’s

biological potential.”
0’Connor Supports Idea

Basil O’Connor, president of the
National Foundation (formerly the
National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, the institution that fi-
nanced, in a large part, Salk’s
polio vaccine) supported Salk’s
idéas. .-
' The National Foundation has

agreed to provide operational
support for the institution with
a minimum annual stipend of
one million dollars,’ Dr.’ Salk
said.

In addition to this, the Founda-
tion would contribute ‘at least one
million - dollars annually - for ' an
endowment fund until the Found-
ation’s contributions had reached
ten million dollars.

Explains Set-up

Salk explained the probable
set-up of the_ institute.

“It will consist of a number
of permanent members, with
different but over-lapping in-
terests and a group of visiting
members having diverse inter-

V ests and drawn from all parts

of the world.

“An important part will be
formed’ by young people who will
spend a period of time at the
start of their careers as fellows
of the institute. It is hoped that

in these various ways freshness

of spirit and vitality will be main-

A campaign to raise $1,600,000

GOV€I'IlIIl€Ilt9S. Views

By"Lo1s DIAMOND
Sir William Marmon Quao Halm,

ambassador from

Ghana, defended Ghana’s government before his Midday

audience this past week.

“It is only three years ago since we in Ghana started to
chart our own course in both the domestic and foreign

scenes,” he began.

“Some people have been con—¢

fused, sompwhat by some recent
events in Ghana and have rushed

into speculating whether we are
not heading for dictatorship/It
is not so . . . Was Linc'oln practic-
ing dictatorship when he fought
to preserve the Union of this great
country? ,

In recent times when your
own. President used Federal
troops in what he described as
action designed to defend the
constitution in Little Rock, he
received some hax-sh'words and
was compared to some strange
historical ﬁgures of the twen-
tieth century, ocntinued I-Ialm.

“The least the world can do,"
he pleaded, “is to learn, under-
stand and appreciate the aspira-
tions of our peoples in their ef-
forts against domination, discrim-
ination, ignorance, and poverty.
There is great hope in what
America can do and I’m sure will
do, if the facts are properly un-
derstood,” he concluded.

In answer to why he turned to
Israel for co—operation and mutual
assistance, his excellency replied,
“We have many things in common
with this small nation. Therefore,
it is able to supply technical and
managerial know—how.” -

Referring to foreign aid from
the Soviet Union, Halm comment-
ed, “We are prepared’ to receive
aid -— even from the devil.”

What is" the greatest problem
facing Ghana today? According to

' Halm it is not national unity. The

th_ree R’s is now his major con-
cern. English is Ghana’s national’
language.

,  The “experts” agreed,‘ ranking Penn State, Lehigh,
Syracuse and Cornell ahead of the Panthers. By the end‘

 ..season’s activities: seven wins, one loss _and one tie (with

  That one loss to Michigan came -when one of. Peery’s

  Last weekend the Panther wrestlers reached the apex

disturbed me. » . '
I thought to myself, how

‘absurd; now why should a simple -
little old sign upset ’me. It was’
merely a call to ,more furious‘

fellowship among men. It mere"-
ly meant to prompt its readers
to a few drinks, lots of laughs,
and to talk of things “nice and
pleasant,” but not controversial.

It merely meant what it said‘--‘

be sociable.

Nonetheless, I found it very
difficult to drive this simple
phrase from my mind. Suddenly
it occurred to me that I was not
disturbed by what the sign said,
but by what it implied by om-
mission. I .

Did this phrase mean to imply

that one should be nothing else:

butsociable? And that any de-
viation from sociability is frown-
ed upon? . . . ‘ ._

And that to be anything else

butsociable is to be “different”?,.-

And that to be different might
even mean going so far as to be
intellectually curious? And that
intelligence and intellectual curi-
osity deserve a “bad eye”? And
that sociability is the ultimate

goal of “The American Way of.

Life”?
But so, I thought, this could
not be. After all, is this not ,a

university? A place where‘ in-

tellectual curiosity abounds? A
place set apart from the. anti-
intellectual society by which it
is surrounded?

A place not to be connected’

with intellectual conformity and
prejudice? A place where child-
birth'is conceived as being a
phenomena which_occurs when a
brain is born with a body at-
tached? A place where everyone,
but everyone, writes his own

Guts In Eastern
‘tournament  

By TED COLTON

’‘ V‘ \The past Eastern Intercollegiate "Wrestling Tournament held at‘
Princeton University over the weekend was a successful yet’ disap-
pointing trip. Rex Pcery’s matmen ﬁnished with a total of 66 points,
thvensame number as our old nemesis Penn State. *

 i This was cinly the third time in 56 Eastern tournaments-that
there was a tie for the team honors. In 1927 Lehigh and Yale tied
and in 1941 Princeton and Yale did likewise. ’

. To get back to this year’s tourney, it'» was a successful trip’ be-
cause the Panthers did manage to tie Penn State, which had been
heavily favorite to win the Easterns. The disappointing factors came
when Larry Lauchle, last year’s 130 champion, failed to, regain his
title, and the second reason was that all the members of the Pitt
aggregation, with the exception/of Publicity. Director Beano Cook,
thought the Panthers would win the title. _

I I After thetﬁrst round of wrestling which saw Lehigh placing
eight men and Penn State nine inthe quarter-ﬁnals with the

1 Panthers placing only seven the outlook was not too bright. The

’ picture changed for the better Friday night when fogur Lehigh
and two State wrestlers were eliminated while only one Panther
fell_by the wayside. (Len Vuocolo lost to Army’s Al Rushatz who
 rgeventually won the 177 pound class). I V .

It In the semi-finals Lehigh lost two more matmen while State lost
three and the Panthers lost only one in the semi-finals. Saturday night
the Pantherswere in good shape to cop their fourth Eastern title.
'Pitt,had ﬁve wrestlers in the ﬁnals while Statehad four-and«Lehigh

for the team trophy -and Pitt had the edge going into the ﬁnals.
But the worm began to turnin the ﬁnal round of wrestling. The
ye. remaining wrestlers for Pitt »were Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle,
Daryl Kelvington, John Zolikoff and Tom Hall. Martin and Kel-
"vington were expected to lose while Lauchle was a “sure bet” to win,
* ‘and Zolikoff and Hall were going to have to battle to win. .
Martin lost to Dave Auble of Cornell, who ‘was the best
wrestler in the tournament, and one of the best in the country.
The scoreiof the match was 11-2 but Martin should do better
the next time they meet. , '
Then the unexpected occurred. Mike Leta of Rutgers, an unknown

 

_. ‘ 23-7, 13-2 and 13-5 upset Lauchle in the most exciting rrfatch of the

tournament. Leta scored first when he used the leg tackle. Lauchle
escaped in no time and got taken down again by the same maneuver.
After escaping once more Lauchlc took Leta ‘down to tie the score
at 4-4 while still in the first period. _

3 Then Leta escaped and proceeded in.taking Lauchle down three
 more times to build up a 12-5 lead near the end of the second period.
At this point Lauchle started a comeback that will be talked about at
Princeton for some time. By the time there was only a minute remain-
»ing in the bout the Pitt junior had tied the score at 14 all and the

crowd went in hysterics.

I , With 51 seconds remaining Lauchle was on top and he might

, have had riding time (one extra point) if he,cou1d. hold Leta the .

I rest of the way. Such was not the case. Leta escaped with ten

-_ ‘seconds to go and literally ran the remaining seconds to gain

the 15-14 victory. N _ ' V

A ‘ At this point this reporter did some fast ﬁguring and found that

"Pitt could lose the 137 pound class and still win the tourney if they

{beat State in the 147 and 191 pound classes. - _

And that is exactly what happened. Kelvington then lost to Les
Austin as expected. John Zolikoff and Tom Hall were tremendous in
victory. Each boy showed an overwhelming desire to win. Zolikoff
‘ was facing Sam Minor in- the 147 division. In the ﬁnal period he was
I . tied at four all and a little over a minute remaining. At this point
’ 1' the mad Russian reversed Minor for two points and the match. “I
had planned it all the way,” stated the sophomore from Erie, Pa.

Hall's victory was the same type. He was trailing 2-0 at the“?
end of the first period and 3-1 at the end of the second period.
‘After escaping to make the score 3-2 Hall and Phil Myer, State’s
‘ 191 pounder, continued to’ wrestle without any‘ takedowns. ‘

Then with less than a minute left Hall went for a takedown and
7 got it to make the score 4-3 in favor of Hall. Myer then escaped to
r tie the score with 20 seconds left. With one ﬁnal great effort Hall
went after Myer again, using the same hold he had used less than a
i_ minutelbefore, and got the takedown to ‘beat Myer.

The "efforts of Hall and Zolikoff in the ﬁnal matches were
something to behold. ‘It was nothing but desire and guts. Both
boys knew thatxthey had to win and they went out and did the
5 job. It was a great contribution to Pitt and both boys showed
what great athletes are made of. '

But the Panther’s victory was to end on a sour note. Penn State’s
heavyweight, Johnston Oberly, needed a pin to tievthc meet. In the
-‘second period he put Brown’s John Wood on his back and pinned

him. The 260 pound frame of Oberly was just too much for the in-

experiecnced wrestler from Brown. A V

But the Panther victory was gained not only by Martin, Lauchle,

3 4 Kelvington, Zolikoff and Hall. Two other wrestlers made the vic-

 tory possible.

E ’ Bob Guzik and Len Vuocolo both scored points for Pitt.
Guzik took third place in the heavyweight class and also added
two important points with a pin and winning by default one
time. Vuocolo scored one point when he won his first match. I

i Guzik lost his grudge match with Oberly as the oversized mat-

Strong Nucleus

With the baseball season‘
less than three weeks away,
Coach Bobby Lewis is putting
his forces through their paces
in preparation‘ for their open-
er with Allegheny College on
April 9.

From a squad of 37 candidates
the Panthers have six returning
lettermen that ﬁnished last season
with a commendable 14-4 mark.

Since the graduation of All-
American S hort -s-top George
Schoeppner, the biggest problem
Lewis faces is ﬁnding a capable
replacement for the hot inﬁeld
spot. “We also need a catcher,”
Lewis said, “although we do have
ﬁve candidates.” ~ .

The nucleus of the Cats pitch-
‘ ing’ staff will center around.Bob
Conti, 4-1 last year. and Dick
Wirth, '4-2., Ralph Shutterly, a
good. sophomore prospect, could
help round out the starters. An-
other possibility is last years’
first baseman Ron Maser."

Maser had been bothered "by
arm trouble as a, sophomore, but
could be ready to do some throw-
ing. “We do need him in» the
lineup all the time,” commented
Lewis, “but if he wants to pitch
we will use him. When he’s not
pitching he’will play first base.”

The Panthers also have two va-
cant outﬁeld berths.

  Editor Chass Blasted by Grid
Players on Red .ShirtArtieie

A
7

To red shirt or not to red shirt, that is the question. In
a recent article appearing in the Pitt News, Editor Murray
Chass ‘blasted the policy of red—shirting "in which the uni-
versity’s athletic department is now engaging.

For those readers who do ‘not «know what a red—shirt is,
we shall explain the term in the next few lines. Deﬁnition of

red shirt: (not from Webster’s¢

Dictionary) an athlete who is held
out of competition for a season in

order that he may be eligible in a
later term. ‘

He may be held out for a num-
ber of reasons, some of which are

as follows: an injury, low grades «

or not being good enough to help
the team during the season.

Storms School ,

Chass’ article took theuniver-
sity by storm. Every athlete in
the school was blasting Chass for
the article. Our gridiron heroes
were the- most offended and they
reacted with the same weapon
which. was /used» to blast them --
the pen. The sports department
received a deluge of letters con-
demning Chass. for his article.

In order to give readers the
other sideof the story we have
attempted to print parts of some
of the letters.

“After three years _of reading
your gripes about how stupid,
overpaid and animalistic you
feel our athletes are, I think‘ you
have gone too.far. I may be a
poor, ignorant athlete, but even
I know that before one writes and
article to‘ be widely read, he
should know what he is writing
about.’ V y .
if‘After reading your brilliant

“know—nothing” article of -March

~ 7, it is clear to me that you know

nothing; furthermore, anyone who
believes what you wrote is being
greatly deceived.”

After describing to Mr. Chass
what a red shirt is and how hard
he works, ‘our athlete concludes,
“If you, Mr. Murray Chassfhave
intestinal fortitude to
come out for football, maybe you
would receive an athletic scholar-
ship for,doi_ng nothing.”

“If we looked very hard, we
might be able to ﬁnd pads small
enough and an over-sized he]-
met.” A ‘ ‘

So to you, Mr. Murray Chass,
anytime you get up enough nerve

to come out for football, do so"

and ﬁnd out what a soft touch the
athlete. hn scholarship has.”
Richard Matyus
Bus. Ad. ’62 (formerly ’61)

V (Editor’s note: Although May-
tus claims Mr. Chass knows
nothing, the editor claims he
has enough sense not to put his‘
5-6, 145—pound frame on ‘the
line across from the 6-2, 220-
pound frame of Matyus. How-
ever, Mr. Chass would like Mat-
yus to know that he would be

happy to challenge him to a‘

game of squash or tennis any-
time he desires.) ‘ ‘

Another Gridder Writes

.“It is my opinion that Mr. Chass
w_ent just a little too far for this
time. This is my third year at
Pitt and it’s my consensus that
certain “sports writers” of the
Pitt News continually knock ath-
letics. :

“In the first place I think
most of us realize that when a
school recruits some 30 football
players, there are bound to be_
aifew who may never play var-
sity ball because of various rea-

' sons. Believe menthere‘ are very

mediocre ballplayers just as
there are medocre writers as an
example.

“The phrase about the three-
year vacation was the one that
really hurt -me the _most. I was
a bred-shirt ‘last year along with
Freddie Cox and about eight
other fellows- I can honestly say
that I worked just as hard ‘last
year as I did this year, and that
goes for my fellow players also.
i Staying with "the free ride rou-
tine, I don’t see where Mr. Chass
has the nerve to say this. If I re-
call, Mr. Chass got quite a nice
ride to t_he.West Coast -last year,
and I may’ be mistaken, but I
don’t think it hurt his pocketbook
one bit.” ' ’ C _

The writer‘ goes on to point
out what a hard life the athlete
leads and states that-Mr. Chass

. People break it open to

demonstrate its unique Dual’Fill"cr containing Activated

Charco'al._They may not know why it works so well, but they do know this: It delivers
far more than high ﬁltration . . . it brings out the best taste of the.-best tobaccos—as

no single ﬁlter can.’

Try a pack of Tardytons. We believe the extra pleasure they bring will soon have

you passing the good word to your friends.

  
    

. HERE'S HOW THE DUAL FILTER DOES IT:

1. It combines agunique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
. . . definitely proved toimake the smoke of a cigarette mild.
and smooth . . .

2. with an efficient pure white ‘outer filter. Together they bring
you_ the real wing in mildness and fine tobacco taste!

Over Weekend

M For the second straight year the_

Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-
sociation Championships will be
held at the NYU pool. The tour-
nament is sponsored by the Mer-
chant Marine ‘Academy of King-
point, L.I., New York.

The Violets of NYU are the
logical "favorites to capture the
crown from the ﬁeld of nine en-

tries, because of their season’s
performance and the advantage of
"the home pool.

Coach Ben Grady says, “We
have a good chance and are aim-
ingfor the top, but even second
will be a tough ﬁght.”

The. two day meet gets un-
derway this Friday and ends
.Saturday night. The races are
divided into two different groups
with the preliminaries and ﬁnals
of each taking place on the same
day to insure a night's rest to
those wishing to compete in the
upper limit of three events.

The Aquatic Cats, last year’s
winner, will be returning only one
charqpion, Bart Haas in the 100

vfreestyle. However, three of the

four men on the record breaking

freestyle relay will be back.

As a college sophomore, you’re nearing the mid-point.
Halfway through col1ege—,-halfway through Army ROTC.
Now you face a major decision: Are the gold bars of a
Second Lieutenant worth two additional years of study

. That question is yours to answer now——before you

year. As you explore the facts,

carefully weigh the traditional responsibilities and rewards
of serving as an Army officer . . . ,  y-  .

\

1. Traditional responsibilities. To meet the command responsi-
bilities of an Army officer, you apply the leadership prin-
ciples absorbed during advanced ROTC training. And your
executive potential grows as you gather leadership experi-

   

ence. That's why employers often prefer men who served as "
commissioned oﬂicers. These men already have proven
their capacity to shoulder executive responsibility.

O .
Traditional rewards. In every organization, greater respon-

sibilities mean greater rewards.Thus the traditional respon-
sibilities and prestige of an Army officer are matched by
material advantages. For example, if you plan to marry
900" flftef 8‘raduation—an oﬂicer’s salary can be a distinct
advantage. A married 2nd Lieutenant earns a minimum of
$355.68 per month-—plus substantial fringe beneﬁts.

’ ,‘Response- ” Magnanimous’

    

Students Receive
E Book Center as S uceess:

New

, If student reception to the new university bookstore con-

tinues to parallel. the response

received by the management

after the open houses held last Thursday and-Friday, the
book center will doubtless be a success. A

Paul Boltacz, general manager of the store, and former
manager of the Health Professions Book Store, stated that

the “response was magnanimous.”.O

According to Boltacz, from 4-
5000 persons attended the open
house held for students on Thurs-
day. At~Friday’s open house held
for students, alumni, and friends
of the university, at least as many,
if not more were present.

However, Boltacz said that
the greatest number of persons
was seen last Monday, the ﬁrst
official ‘day of business. He
seemed pleasantly surprised
that a crowd estimated ‘at 300
people were seen wandering be-
tween the shelves and displays
at lunch time. _ '

When asked, how the students
‘felt about prices in the new store,
Boltacz said, “In the old book
store there was‘considerable grip:
ing about prices because-students
were paying first class‘ prices for
something‘ Tess than first class
facilities.”

He felt that since the situation
had “been ' corrected, the com-
plaints would subside."

Boltacz reiteriated the store’s
policy on how the customer
would be treated.-‘ “We operate i
on a system of soft -sell,’.’ he
stated. ‘jBrowsin‘g -is", not] only
permissible but welcome and
even encouraged. We will soon
put out chairs by different sec-
tions so people will .be able to
sit down while looking.”

He added that the new store
would _also be an. “unparallelel

V repository” ‘for new -books in ‘the’

academic ﬁelds, as all new books
pertaining ,to subjects taught at
the universityqwould be sent out
to the store “imnriediately on pub-
lication.” '_ * ’

By CHUCK DUNBAB.

, It was opening night for the musical comedy “The Pa-
j.a_ir_ia Game” in Stephen Foster ‘Memorial, but snowy weather
provided a rather poor turnout for the event. Undauted, the
ﬁcastovercame that ﬁrst night anxiety to produce a fast-'mov-
-1_nig', yet absorbing "performance.

 In general it was a highly entertaining evening, high-

  
  
    
    
 
   
  
   
  
   
   
  
  

rnembers of the cast, Bill Bowers,
Ittosalie Stewart and Bette Lou;
Cllratz. _

 Bowers, as Hines, the jealous
eﬁlciency expert, can only be de-
scribed as magniﬁcent in his role.
Not only was his acting good,
‘especially in the drunk ‘scene at
Hern'ando's Hideaway, , but his
song and dance numberswere well
executed. He possesses that easy-

"of,_Fi‘cd Astaire.
.,..Rosalie Stewart used her win-
ning smile to full .advantage in
cap"turing- the heart of the audi-
ence; while portraying Babe Wil-
liams, sweetheart of the new pa-
jama factory manager. .
Iieussvnemanding But Vvell Playe
 ~,Tlie boss’s secretary, Mabel,
isn’t .the demanding role that
rBabe’s is, but Bette Lou Gratz
played it most humorously to the
"'oyment of the audience.
Sandra Deakter, pl a y i n g
: Gladys (Hines’s man-chasing
1 girl friend), and Gil Lazier, as
W , Sid, who seeks the affections of
Babe, had extremely tough roles
to ﬁll, but lroth, nevertheless,
, were very effective. Sandra’s
j, belly dance to the tune of “Her
‘ Is" and her performance in the
' f‘Jc_alousy Ballet” were real eye
openers. Lazier started slowly.
, _ ' but soon became accustomed to
i "N . his part. He sang the melodic
“Hey There” with a tone of sin-
certity. ' -‘
;, Four songs. two
were sung particularly well. These
1-Cwere “I'm Not at All in Love,”
““Once a Year Day,” “Think of the
_ _Time I Save," and “Seven and a
‘ Half Cents.”
