Student Chest
Drive To Start
Final Clean-up

Instructions Given To Workers
On Collection Of Money,
Return Of Receipts

Check - up On Pledges

All essential material to aid class
workers in closing the ﬁnal clean-up
of the Student Chest drive will be
given out this week. This material
includes lists of students who have
paid their donations in full and
signed pledge cards for them, and
lists of students and their pledges
that are yet to -be paid.

Final returns for most of the divi-
sions of the drive are not yet avail-
able. The combined return of fresh-
man and sophomore English classes
will be about $750, if the returns that
have been checked are indicative of
the class average.

Individual solicitors, women’s and
men’s fraternities and engineering
seminar workers are slow in handing
in their returns according to Homer
Wadsworth, C35, director of the drive,
and, therefore, no ofﬁcial returns for
.the campaign will be given out for
publication.

Indications shows that the men’s
fraternities and the engineering and
business administration seminars will
back the drive almost 100 per cent.

Detailed instructions given to work-
ers this week are as follows: return
the receipts to those who paid in
cash. Receipts will be given to those
students who have pledged only when
the pledge is paid in full.

Collect the money from those who
have pledged. All pledges are due
December 15, unless a later date was
designated. Be sure to turn in the
name and amounts for all who pay
money to you.

greatest Turkey Day Classic to grace

decade, As has been said every year
prior to the Pitt-Tech fracas and as
will be said for every succeeding
year prior to the Pitt-Tech fracas,
“All that has gone before does not

Oddly enough, this stock phrase is
always the truth. it is true even this
year, when both outﬁts have come
down to the wire with more than
creditable records. November 30

savors of things other than turkey
and stuffings_

What Pitt has is pretty well known.
What Tech has is perhaps 11013 S0 Well
known to the Pitt campus. It’s hardly
necessary to mention that Tech has
Howard Harpster this year. Return-
ing to his alma mater to take over
the football coaching duties, the
“Howitzer" has produced remarkable
results in his first season.

Harpster has done great things,
but . . . he has had some very good
material. Eastern critics are already
hailing Bunny Burzio as an outstand-
ing candidate for al1—American honors
at a guard position. Burzio’s work
against Notre Dame and Michigan
State, particularly, have pretty ﬁrmly
impressed the well—knowii stamp of
approval upon this Tartan’s broad
back_ In Captain Colin Stewart and
Libbus Lewis, Tech has a pair of ends
who may well rival any pair of ﬂank-
ers that the Panthers may offer.

Skipping back to the backﬁeld, we
ﬁnd Angelo Beviviiio directing the of-
fensives. Beviviiio tips the scales in
the neighborhood of 150 pounds, but

what the VVarren lad lacks in heft he)

certainly makes up in brains. Our

own Howdy O’Dell will for once out-|

weigh a rival halfback_ Iii little Steve
Terebus, “Terrible Steve” they used
to call him up at Johnstown high,
Tech has a slippery halfback who has
amazed critics thus far with his ball-
carrying ability and his sterling work
upon defense. At fullback will be Joe
Mihm, who not so many yea.rs ago
pulverized city high school lines while
fullbacking for Schenley high. Joe is
still a high—class line-plunger and his
kicking is far from ordinary. The Ta!‘-
tans can choose from a group of Bill
Spisak, Elmer Vorderburg, or Johnny
Sayles for the other part of their
back-ﬁeld without lessening the
quartet's prowess one whit. For the
ﬁrst time in years the Tartan have a
basis for their conﬁdence.

From other angles, Pitt has a slight
advantage in having eleven days
to get over the Nebraska encounter.
Tech will have to meet New York
university in what promises to be a
hard-fought affair this Saturday, On
the other hand, Pitt has a chance to
go stale over the unaccustomed layoff
while the Tartans will be in full
stride. -Just how the value of these

‘two conditions can be weighed may

‘be determined on Thanksgiving after-
-noon, -Maybe it won't make any dif-
ference.

Lots of things can happen between
now and Thursday. Whatever hap-
pens it will rightfully ‘be said, “All
that has gone before does not matter
‘when these arch-rivals clash."

YMCA To Bring
‘Dad’ Elliott Here

Associate National Secretary To
Speak To Students

The Pitt YMCA will feature A. J.
“Dad” Elliott, former Northwestern
university all-American, who is now
associate national secretary of the
national YMCA, in a tliree-day SeSSl0Il,
December 6, 7 and 8. as a Speaker 011
student religious problems.

“Dad" Elliott will speak to campus
groups when he is at the University

Panther Harriers Capture  
Seventh Place In N.   Y. Meet

Finishing three places better in team scores than did last year’s '
"cross-country outﬁt, the Pitt harriers took seventh place in team
competition at the annual intercollegiate association run. in New
The Panther total of 234 points was bettered by
only Michigan State, Manhattan, Yale, Cornell, Syracuse and Maine,
in a ﬁeld which included cross-country teams from 18 leading col-
logos and universities in the East and Midwest.

fort was made by Sam Musico, who:
ﬁnished twenty-ninth. Charles Kirk-I
patrick took thirty-ﬁrst place and:
‘William Albright was thirty-ninth;
Farther down in the lists were Jiml
Watkins as ﬁfty-eighth and Bill Law-
i-ence as seventy-eighth, In all, 118
runners answered the starter’s gun in
the race.

Running nineteenth in a ﬁeld ofl
seventy-nine, Harold Tost, Pitt’s lone;
entry in the freshman event, turned
in a creditable performance, whichi
augurs well for his future with Pitt
harrier teams. ,

Michigan State was far and away
the best team in the run. Led by
’i‘ommy Ottey, last year's third place
winner, the Staters had ﬁve men ﬁn-
ishing among the ﬁrst twenty. Ottey,
an Ardmore boy, covered the six-mile
Van Cortlandt park course in exactly
30 minutes. This time fell slightly
short of last year’s record, Manhattan
college, team winners in the 1932
race, toppled from the heights this
year, -but managed to gather in a sec-
ond place in the varsity team totals
and a ﬁrst place- in the team event
for ﬁrst—year men.

Considering the Pitt showing in the
light that they bested teams repre-
senting Harvard, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, New York uni-
versity, Rutgers, Princeton, Columbia,
College of the City of New York,
Dartmouth, Penn and Rhode Island,
the home boys did quite well. These
outﬁts are quite above the “push-
overx” class in cross-country affairs.

,1’ l\lusic0’s surprise effort culminated,
‘a marked scale of improvement dur-E
»Iing the year. Starting out by follow—‘
ing upon the heels of last year’s star
gperformers, this curly—headed runner
'1advanced, step by step, until he
crashed through to ﬁnish ﬁrst for
the Panthers in the meet with Car-
negie Tech, the last of the season.

V’I7lTile in New York the Panthers
stayed at the Taft hotel and, by special
arrangements made by, Manager De
Marche, the boys were guests of Ed-
die Cantor at his Sunday night broad-
cast from Radio City. The party re-
turned to Pittsburgh at 9:30 Tuesday
morning. Those making the trip were
Coach Olson, Don Harrison, VVatkins,
Lawrence, Albright, Wagenhouser,

Panther Cagers
Schedule 3 More
Pre-Season Tilts

: Veteran Squad Will Take Floor

For Georgetown Opener;
Ochsenhirt At Forward

 

Schedule Is Announced

Having once been tested in actual
competition and facing three more
warm-up engagements before the
opening of the regular basketball
season, the Pitt cage team is rapidly
rounding into form for the inaugural
on December 9th with Georgetown.

Tuesday night the Panthers trav-
eled to East Liberty YMCA for a
practice game. As is the case in all
such practice affairs, no score was
kept. The Pitt team lined up with
Cribbs at center, Skip Hughes and
Russ Ochsenhirt at the forwards, and
Don McCamant and Charley Hughes
at the guard positions. This looks
like" the regular starting combination,
the only change from last year’s line-
up being the shifting of Ochsenhirt
from guard to forward, thus replacing
Don Smith.

I ' Last night the ﬂoormen took on the

W’ i l m e r d i n g YMCA aggregation,
coached by Willie Kowallis, former
Panther cage star. Tuesday night
will have the basketeers stacking up
against the McKeesport Civics. This]
fray will present a bit of an old-time
touch when "Don Smith leads the
Tubers against his former mates.

The Johnstown basketball clinic
will form the setting for the next
Pitt practice encounter. The clinic
will take place on Saturday, Decem-
ber 2nd, at the Johnstown Center Ju-
nior College, preceding the huge
clinic to be held at the Stadium the
following week.

These four games are the only ones 1
on the Panther basketball calendar
prior to the lid-lifter of the regular
season. Just what can be expected
of Georgetown is little known. The
Hoyas may be depended upon to bring,
a squad of big boys, but the Golden-
Panthers aren’t quite so small this]
year as they were last year and the’
Whsliingtonians didii’t offer much of
a test then.

Drafted

I guess you think the manager of a football team has a soft job. Well,
perhaps you had better have a talk with Cliff McClain, manager of the
Varsity B team. Last Saturday down at Morgantown where the B team
played the West Virginia Junior Varsity, Coach Eddie Schultz of the Panther
team, made so many substitutions that in the last quarter he was forced
to call on Manager McClain to go into the game a.nd play tackle.

And playing tackle against some big bruising hilly billy from them -thar
mountains of VVest Virginia. is no joke.

_ Incidentally the lineup of this same game showed that the Panther B
team had at man on its roster by the name of Horizontal. A little investiga-
tion revealed that this was a supposedly humorous name for a member of
the B squad, also a patron of the ﬁne art of ﬁsticuifs.

Frosh Swimmers

There seems to be a dearth of candidates for the freshman swimming
team this year. A1’ second call for embryo Lindb-ergs and Adlersburgs to
report to Coach Pat Corr has been issued.

What's the matter? Are there no Buster Crabbes in the audience?

Wrestlers

Dr. J. B. Sutherland, who is to coach the wrestling team here, has
requested all students interested in the manly art of ﬂying mares and head-
locks to report to the football practice ﬁeld Monday afternoon at 4215.

As yet no deﬁnite location for wrestling practice has been settled upon
but there is a chance that the Oil and Gas building will serve the purpose.
A new 20 by 20 wrestling mat has been purchased by the University. so
that the wrestlers will not be handicapped as they have been in the past.

-Practice Game

That. practice basketball game up at the Stadium last night between the
Panther varsity team and the W-ilmerding YMCA was well worth seeing.
The “Y” team is coached by Willie Kowallis, former Panther star, and last
year won the West Penn League title. Its lineup includes “Bernie” Leech,
former Pitt star, and Coffey, former Ohio State star, among others.

Picking the Winners

If you’d like to win some money in the football contest sponsored by a
downtown paper you may by picking Carnegie Tech over NYU, Bucknell
over W. & J., Dartmouth over Chicago, Columbia over Syracuse, Detroit
over Michigan State, Iowa State over Drake, Auburn over Florida, Vvest Vir-
ginia over Georgetown, Georgia over Georgia Tech, Yale over Harvard.
Purdue over Indiana, Akron over Mt. Union, Iowa over Nebraska, Michigan
over Northwestern, Southern California over Notre Dame, Ohio State over
Illinois, Baylor over Southern Methodist, California over Stanford, Army
over Navy, and Washington over VVasl1ington State.

Rose Bowl Dope

Should California win over Stanford tomorrow they will in all prob-
ability be the Paciﬁc Coastg representative in the annual Rose Bowl game
New Year’s Day.

disregarded in the matter. Both
teams have promised to accept the
Rose Bowl bid if victorious.

It all started when someone made
a mistake and challenged the News
staff to a football game, Some one
else blundered and accepted for the
News. The matter rested there.
Neither staff is quite sure what is go-
ing to happen, and both coaches, re-
fusing to be quoted, said, “We won’t
win.” Since both staffs are in the
pink (toothbrush) of condition, sub-
stitutions will likely be very rare.
Therefore, the majority of the boys
want to be substitutes.

A positive movement is under way
to have several members of both
staffs present in the starting lineups.
The gossip columnists of the rival
publications have been especially re-
quested to be on hand. The editor—in-
chief of the News promises to be on
hand to take a beating as does the
Panther Pilot. The business mana-
gers are undecided whether to play
for their own paper or whether they
want to win the game. Several un-
signed petitions have demanded that
the Scout appear in uniform.

Advertising solicitors have been
recruited to handle the “line,” and in
all probability will be a screaming
success. No proselyting will be per-
mitted and the Panther staff has been
especially warned against this meth-
od of recruiting players.

part of the crop.)

The lineups are uncertain at pres-
ent, as both staffs still have no idea

Sees Rise Of Other Catholic Schools In Football As

Cause For Decline

Of Rambler Teams

By The Campus Scout
1931-1932

The boys who said that Hunk Anderson and Notre Dame were

on the well—known spot were only partially right.

Every Notre

Dame-bred coach at a Catholic university is on the spot.

It all started back in the early “20’s” when a Catholic univer-
sity of some 2,000 students, located near South Bend, grabbed the
national spotlight by trouncing the football teams of other and larger
schools in such a convincing manner as to leave no doubt as to the

superiority of the contesting teams.
Nobody considered this a strange%~

feat because it had been done be-
fore. Nor were many surprised when
this school remained at the top of
the heap. If new ﬁgures were not
added occasionally to the class A
football realm, Yale, Harvard and
Princeton would still be the “Big
Three,” Cornell would be trouncing
Michigan 40-0 instead of being on the
short-end of a similar score with the
same team, and Wash-Jeff, a school
of about 500 students, would not be
invited to play a Rose Bowl game
with bigger California,

Football, however, depends upon
more than victories to pack 60,000
fans into a. stadium. It demands color.
Color came with the “Four Horse-
men.” People were soon calling a
line of seven huskies the “Seven
Mules.” “Shock Troops,” “One-Play
O’Brien” and “Fighting Irish” were
parts of every gridiron fan’s vocab-
ulary.

But South Bend is not within easy
reach of all sections of the country.
The boys who, because of their re-
ligion, “adopted” Notre Dame as their
alma mater wanted a miniature
Notre Dame in their own backyard.
To be sure, they never expected to
play Notre Dame.’ They just wanted
a team that was supreme in their
own locality.

Horsemen,” Duquesne, the fullback,
and ﬁnally Fordham, the left half.
Slip Madigan was at St. Mary’s on
the coast, and several other Notre
Dame graduates had good coaching
jobs at schools which were not Cath-
olic institutions, such as Yale, Navy,
Michigan State, Purdue and Florida.

Rockne’s tragic death, however,
caused skepticism to replace the un-
dying faith which certain rabid fol-
lowers had attached to the system
which winning football and magniﬁ-
cent publicity had placed upon the
pedestal reserved for champions only.

,What would Notre Dame do now?

Newspapers were particularly
anxious to have this question an-
swered. Approximately one-third of
the population of the country was
Catholic, and every man, woman and
child in this group of over 40,000,000
people was a prospective Notre Dame
fan. They wanted to read about their
favorites in the newspapers, The news-
papers made it possible for them to
read about Notre Dame.. It helped
circulation. The bigger the circula-
tion, the higher the advertising rates,
you know, and hence bigger proﬁts
and salaries.

A 25-12 victory over Pitt in the
middle of the .1931 season, Notre
Dame’s ﬁrst under Anderson, seemed

Final judgment, however, was not
passed then. The “alumni” waited.
Even two 2-touchdown defeats at the

hands of Pitt and Southern California
in 1932 were not enough to cause
them to lose heart. Give Anderson
another year.

Came 1933. Kansas, usually can-
non fodder for the Irish on opening
day, left the ﬁeld with a scoreless tie
to their credit. But to Irish sup-
porters there were still plenty of big
names left on the schedule to erase
the blot of that opening game tie.

But underdog Carnegie Tech won,
7-0. Pitt followed the succeeding week
to repeat its two touchdown victory
of the previous year. Now was the
time for action_

Newspapers realized that Notre
Dame was through for the year, but
its great army of followers were not.
They were looking for’a,nother sim-
ilar institution to whom they could
give their support. Finding that school
meant circulation to the newspapers.

Another leading school was hard to
ﬁnd. Notre Dame had craftily re-
frained from playing other Catholic
schools in football. They had to dig
up the records to ﬁnd a good one.

St. Mary’s on the coast had good

what it’s all about. The Panther staff
boasts (as usual) of an advantage in
both the line and backﬁeld. What lit-
tle advantage remains goes. to the
News. Omer Kronenwetter, Panther
editor, has foolishly consented to act
as Q quarterback for the Panthers.
Marsh and Januska, self-styled “Iron-
Men” will act as halfbacks. The
News staff expects some “ﬁne acting”
from this pair. Sloan, whom the News
suspects of accepting Panther lucre,
has been assigned to the fullback post,
subject to change (in quarters.)

The News staff refuses to divulge
any information of its line-up, rely-
ing on the prediction of the week to
explain everything. However the edi-
tor-in-chief and the ‘business manager
of the News are rumored as sure
starters.

A military huddle will be used by
both teams. The salient point of the
military huddle will be the retreat.
Something new in the way of signal
barking will be used. Panther plays
will be called in the form of two line
jokes. If the plays are smooth as
past issues, the News promises to
play without a line. Neither team
will have practice sessions prior to
the game.

decisions. the Panther boxing cap-
tain, Jack lschricker, has been pro-,
cured for the occasion. In a carefully;

Personally, I dread the idea of mak-

but I am afraid I must do so. H_ow-
ever, I do not think either team will
show up for the game. This will put
the News on top, as they refused to
divulge their line-up. The Panthers
made a big mistake in mentioning
the names of their players. The
News was wise. Keeping quiet for
once, they will win by a forfeit. If
the News does not win by a forfeit,
and if the Panthers do show up, the

an electric calculator to compute the

Women 's Organizations
Honored By Transfers

VVomen transfers will entertain the
members of the women’s organizations
at Heinz House on December 14, to
show their appreciation for a series of
luncheons given in their honor.

A committee of transfers headed by
Gretchen VVelch, C35, have decided
that the affair will consist of a
luncheon, an entertainment and a
dance for girls. “Of course,” said
Miss Welcli, “we can never fully re-
pay the women’s organizations for
what they have done for us. In ad-
dition to the luncheons, they have
helped to solve our problems and
make us feel as if we were really a
part of the University.”

The organizations that have en-
tertained the transfers are WSGA,
ofﬁce of the dean of women, Pan-
hellenic council, YWCA, WAA, Glee
club and sophomore class.

crease over last year’s membership,
orchestral positions are still open to
any interested applicants, it was an-
nounced by H. Ellsworth Miller, man-
ager. Violin and bass viol players are
especially welcome to try out.

Morale
By Edward J. Waldman, Jr.,

Editor-in-Chief, The Duquesne Duke
(6 N INSTITUTION never rises above the

morale of its student body,” an eminent
educator from abroad has repeatedly stated from
our local platforms.

No statement can be truer than this. And, we
might add, the same statement is a general truth
when applied to individuals, homes, churches, com-
munities, and even states and nations.

If we grant that the morale does govern the
heights to which we rise, then we must universally
agree that life is what we make it. What about
the man who sits idly by and waits for opportu-
nity to come his way, and then because he does not
ﬁnd that long—awaited visitor knocking at his door,
becomes a grouch and claims that the world is
not giving him his just share? What about his
morale? Or does he have any? If God would
create a person without a morale, this type of in-
dividual would certainly be that person.

Too often, young men and women become dis-
couraged with life and its trying problems before
they have ever started to delve into these prob-
lems. They become unproductive, so to speak,
even before they become productive. The athlete
who has lost the game before it commences, is the
loser after the contest has been played. This is
merely what Huxley terms, “the game of life.” If
our morale, our pep and our spirit are ebbing,
there are ninety-nine chances to one for failure in
Whatever we are attempting to do, whether it be to

win a football game, to solve a diﬂicult problem,
or to investigate the realms of unknown science.
With a play of words, however, it is just as easy
to say that there are ninety-nine chances to one
for success in achievement, if we have the proper
spirit, the grit—the morale!
