  Will Stud

National Campaigns
May Draw Support

University officials may have a battle this
year over their long-standing ban on cam-
pus political groups afiiliated with the Dem-
ocratic and Republican parties. -

General Dwight Eisenhow’er’s announce-
ment of willingness to run for President in 1952
touched off talk today that an “I Like Ike” move-
ment is’ in the planning stage.

And student members of the Democratic Party
were expected to initiate a campus movement in
support of a presidential candidate, probably Presi-
dent Harry S. Truman.

Will Get Cold Shoulder

But if past political campaigns "are any indica-
tion, students who attempt to get University ap-
proval for a political movement on campus, will
probably get the cold shoulder.

Student Congress may be asked to take a stand
against the University’s unwritten policy ‘of not
recognizing political groups here.

Basis for this attitude of the Pitt administration,
according to Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle, is
that the University “does not wish to be affiliated

  

Dependent for its existence on a state appropri-
ation granted by the Pennsylvania legislature, the
University “must live with all political parties,
and,” Dean Biddle said, “it seems sound not to
appear to foster any, political group.”

While students, acting as private citizens, have
frequently entered in political activity; the Univer-
sity has not granted recognition to a campus po-
litical group. Recognition would entitle the group
to hold meetings on campus, invite speakers, and
post notices on bulletin boards. ‘

Nevertheless one campus leader, Cyril Wecht,
feels that there will deﬁnitely be movements of
students for the various candidates in the 1952
presidential campaign. Wecht, president of Student
Congress, sought recognition of a Young Demo-
crats movement on campus during the 1950 elec-
tions.

Squabble in ’47

A major controversy over student politics arose
in the fall of 1947, when a campus group invited
Henry Wallace to speak at the University. Wallace,
Progressive Party candidate for President in 1948,
was not granted a University room for his speech,
because of its “political" nature, though he had not
yet declared his candidacy for the Presidency.

The group who invited Wallace to speak eventu-
ally secured Carnegie Music Hall for the address.

SC Plugs Dawson for Coach

Congress Recommends Athletic Committee

Hire MSC Mentor As Football Coach Here

Student Congress backed “Red” Dawson for the job of

head football coach at its regular Monday afternoon meet-
ing. Dawson is now backﬁeld mentor of Michigan State and
has been considered a leading candidate for the Pitt va-

cancy.

Congress’ backing of Dawson came on a voice vote of a

4-Year Draft

College students will no
longer get thirty days of
grace after graduation to en-
list in the service .of their
choice before being drafted.

A bulletin from the ofﬁce of the
Selective Service director, Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey, explains that
under the present law tlﬁge special
8'0-day stay of induction“”i;von’t be
necessary. Students are ‘deferred
now, instead of having their_ in-
ductions postponed.

This means that between the
date of the end of the school year
and the date when the student’s

or tells him to report for induc-
tion, he should have ample time
to enlist, the bulletin states.
Students are now granted either
Class 1—S or Class 2-S deferments.
Only students who have taken

motion favoring the big ten coach.
There were no 'nays, but there

were several members who ab— -

stained. No record vote was taken.

“Congress, as one member point-
ed out, has no power to decide who
the coach will be, but only can
recommend. V

Bill McKinley, Pat Clohessy, and
Nancy Tear, members of Congress,
all agreed that Dawson was a
“competent” coach, an “excellent”
man, “on_e of the best.” ,

Opposition to Dawson on the

a physical exam and have been or-
dered to report for induction are
eligible for the Class. 1-S defer-
ment. It is a “one—shot” deferment
which permits them to ﬁnish out
the year. They get it by having
their dean tell their draft board
that they are full-time 1" students
doing satisfactory work.

Local boards can, if they choose,
keep a man in Class 2-S during his
whole college career on the basis
of his scholastic standing and/ or
his score on the qualiﬁcation test,
under present policy.

ROTC Men to Give 372 Pints
Of Blood At Red Cross Unit

Pitt’s ROTC has scheduled an
“Operation Bloodmobile” on Jan.
M and 18. University students in
the Army and Air Force Reserve
Program have pledged 372 pints of
blood on those days. , ,

The Air Force will keep th
mobile unit operating to‘maximum'
capacity with 187 donors pledged
for January 17. This is the Blood-.
mobile’s entire quota for one day.’
According ;to Captain  B

     
   

released from “ROTC class on the
day they donate blood.

The Army will take over the
Bloodmobile on January 18 and
will donate 185 pints of blood. Ma-

jor Loren McCartney said that

they too will be rewarded with
ﬁve merits. However, classes will
continue as scheduled.

ment.that Pitt “should get a head

and an alum as well.”
Investigates Discrimination
Cyril Wecht, Congress president,
reported the activities of the Con-
gress committee, investigating dis-
crimination. He listed places
where the committee thought
probing is necessary. Among them
were services and marriages -in
Heinz Chapel and scholarship ap-
plications which require stating
religion and race. .
Wecht stressed the point that
these areas were just being inves-
tigated and that no concrete evi-
dence has been found so far to be-
lieve that discriminating practices
are going on. The committee will

meet today at 2:30 p.m. in 832 C1.
Faculty Rating To Be Discussed

Congress received .a letter from

Louis Johnston, secretary of the

University Senate Committee on
Student Relations inviting some
congressmen to a meetingiof the
committee tomorrow to discuss the
question of student rating of fac-
ulty.

One moment of silent prayer
will be held at Pitt on Feb. 29. A
letter from Sigma Theta Epsilon,
national Methodist fraternity from
West Virginia asked Congress to
go along with a World Day of
Prayer when , many c o l l e g e s
throughout the nation will observe
a minute of silent prayer.

Makes, Recommendatign

Bill Green suggested that serv-
icemen and women who are grad-
uates or who were students at Pitt-
be admitted to ' athletic contests

identiﬁcation cards ‘of Pitt service-

SC Discrimination ..'Comm.ittcc
Cites Areas For Investigation

The eleven students who attended the open meetingy

of the Student Congress committee investigating discrimina-
tion on campus have cited areas in which discrimination may

duct an
charges.
Another 0 p e 11 meeting is
scheduled today to begin at 2:30
and run to 4:30 p.m. in 832 C1.
Wecht urged all students to at-
tend. especially women who ig-
nored the first meeting. o
The ﬁr'st group to draw ﬁre was
the Heinz Chapel Choir which al-
legedly discriminates against Cath-
olic students. It was pointed -out,
however, that certain rules of the
Catholic religion prohibit its mem-
bers from participating in all of
the’ Choir’s programs. This, rather
than any discrimination, has dis-
couraged Catholics from joining

that the University should refuse

Religious questions on scholar-
ship applications were held to be
discriminatory or to offer the pos-
sibility for discrimination. One
student said that some of the
scholarships contain special re-
ligious qualiﬁcations. Another

4 Coeds Convert Sweet
Cakes to Sweet Trip

By LOIS HOLLERAN

Svgeet proﬁts sent four Pitt girls
to Kansas last week.

Proceeds from a sale of home-
made cookies and candy, and rare
fruit were used to ﬁnance the girls
trip to a national meeting of stu-
dent YM & YWCA leaders.

The girls, Eudora McFadden,‘
Martha Jane Dixon, Lita DeVeyra,
and Lucille Smallwood, represent-
ed the ‘Y’ at the conference, a
movement composed of student
YM&YWCA members and church
groups. The conference was held
in Lawerence, Kansas, from Dec.
27 to Jan. 2. '

Sold At Exorbitant Prices

The idea of selling homemade
delicacies and rare, exotic fruits
for exorbitant prices caught the
imagination of the ‘Y’ group last
fall, and sales continued from Oct.
until Dec. 19.

Yussuff Ibrahim, a foreign stu-
dent from India, was especially
enthusiastic about the sale. Each
morning he brought in choice
fruits which were sold to ‘Y’ vis-
itors for extravagant sums. An-
other visitor to the oiﬁce was at-
tracted by the idea and sent in two
boxes of extra large Christmas
tree cookies.

' Homemade fudge, popcorn balls,
and candied apples completed the
list of goodies.

$112 Raised .

The ten cent cookies, ﬁfty cent
banana, and twenty-ﬁve cent cakes
raised $112 for the trip. The
money was divided equally among
the delegates, who made up the

There is, allegedly, some dis-

no women attended and there were
few who had any evidence to of-

Get More Facts

~ The open meeting of the Congress committee investi-

_‘L gating discrimination revealed that many of the allegations
made in the past are not without foundation, at least_ in

the -minds of some students. The hearing also revealed
that there is a lamentable lackof concrete evidence to sub-
stantiate some of the charges.

0‘ The one area in which concrete evidence does exist

, is the University practice of accepting “white only” restric-

tions, in employment notices on the bulletin boards. Since

.many of the nation’s leading newspapers and institutions
;:of learning have ceased to carry notices with this clause,
;;there is noreason why Pitt should not join them.

: If employers refuse to insert ads, we shall not be the

 losers since many of them rely on underpaid college help.
‘ In fact, while we are furthering, the cause of brotherhood,

we might do something about raising the abysmal wages

paid college students. _

U as Fraternities and sororities on the surfaces have taken
eps toward eliminating prejudice. Most of them have re-
oved racial and religious clauses from their national

charters. ,

This progressive move, however, is frequently negated P
yinserting in the ritual expressions .or oaths which mem-
bers of some religious bodies may not take. And there is

lso the inesitable deduction that something more than a

feeling of sameness makes one fraternity all Jewish, an-

other all Protestant and another all Negro. _
, A similar deduction might be hazarded about the basket-
all team. ’ It seems strange that our scouts. are able to
snare Negro football stars and Negro track stars, but no

«Negro basketball ‘stars. Certainly there are many in. this

strict.

_ ‘The suggestion that there is discrimination in hous-
mg and for scholarships deserves ‘a thorough investigation.

oth of these areas take us out of the bounds of the Uni-

ersity itself and it should be interesting to ﬁnd out just

ow much prejudice there is in this supposedly democratic

‘ty. T . , .

he leadership of Cyril Wecht. We hope their labors con-
nue to unearth more information. And we hope they

Noi Cake. Just Some Money‘  

About this time last year we were working
ourselves into an altruistic frenzy about the ﬁnan-
cial plight of our faculty. Now that they have
been taken care of by a benevolent University,
it is time we turned our attention to the ﬁnancial
problems of the student, that unhappy citizen.

The going wage for the student who works for
the University now stands at the
remarkable—because it com
pletely deﬁes the economic his
tory of the past decade and the
Supreme_Court’s rulings on the:
minimum wage laws-—sum of 55 
cents per hour. 

He may root’ through the 
classics in the library, maintain :
an intricate ﬁling system,. feed
guinea pigs, type up doctor’s
theses or answer the telephone, but his remunera-
tion remains at 55 cents per the hour. There is
no premium paid for skilled labor nor is there
any recognition that certain areas are more dig-A
niﬁed, more edifying. and therefore should pa
correspondingly higher wages. 0
Give Them Cake

The University seems to have a rather aristo-

‘cratic attitude toward the student who works for ,

wages. He is placed so far down the economic
ladder that were he in France in Maria Antoinette’s
day, he would indeed need cake and derive a lot
of pleasure out of chopping off a head or two.

Perhaps there is something edifying about labor ‘

even though it does "not bring large ﬁnancial re-
wards. But there are many who feel that it would
be even more edifying if it were accompanied by
the. merry jingle and happy erinkle of cash.

Do not, however, come to the false conclusion

that this University is the only employer holding
to theories of the early Morgans, Rockerfellers and

,Vanderbilts. Other concerns in Oakland are not
above seeking labor below“the 75 cents minimum »

wage level.

The student who must earn his frat dues and
carfare money outside has always been faced with

Collegiate Clippings . . .

  Lefi-Overs’

There are still the tatters of many events ly-

ing around ' the nations campuses, left over from»

the worn out crazy quilt that made up 1951.
‘ Most of the left—ovgr.patches make up a fam-

iliar pattern from year ‘to year; one of meetings, —

dances, awards, ball-'games—-the usual college ac-
tivities. Here are some of an original design,

which belong exclusively to the
past year.
No B.S. for Phys Ed .

At the University of Virginia,

According to the Daily Tar
Heel, at the University of North
Carolina, Virginia's Dean L.‘ J.
Stiles of the department of ed-
ucation began the action by re-
questing a University Senate resolution asking for
the elimination of the degree.

The mood should be black among the 21 mem-
bers of Virginia’s football team, all of whom had
been working toward the degree in physical ed-
ucation.

The student body and faculty
of the University have clearly
demonstrated that World Broth-
erhood is of vital interest to

  _

reluctant employers who have felt that a litle
surplus of money was incompatible with the pur-
suit of higher learning. '

Out at the University of California students
long ago became aware of this psychological char-
acteristic of employers. , So they got together and
drew up a contract which they called the “Fair
Bear Contract.” (For the uninitiated, the bear is
their mascot. I don’t know whether he is. alive.);

Bear Gets ‘I00’/o Increase

There the Student Labor Council succeeded in
raising the minimum wage from 50 cents to one
‘dollar. They made a thorough study of working
conditions, wage rates and the ability of employers

U to pay. . V

They did not restrict'their study to the Uni-
versity but extended it to the surrounding com-
munity, the San Francisco-Oakland area. They
even classiﬁed their jobs with cdunterparts in reg-
ular employment. ,

The Labor Council prefaced its ﬁndings with
a statement which might bear repeating:

“We believe that any time a student’s gross
income falls ‘below $40.00 (this statement made
ini1.938) his or her standard of living is neces-
sarily below‘ that which we must regard as
conducive to the role we expect theml to as-
sume in this community. It is probable that
this’ sum «is too low; it is hardly possible that
it is“ too high.” ~ g. ,

Out and out treason in some areas; probably
Red-inspired. " -

In 1950 the average overall wage level in the
San Francisco-Oakland area was $1.72 per hour

for a 40 hour week. Their demand for one dollar,

sounds modest indeed. ’

But think of the consternation around here
if we asked for a dollar an hour. Even though the
lucky student who works in ‘a mill on Saturdays

and Sundays may pick up as little as $1.30 and’ , V, 1

as much as $1.90.
I suppose thereare people around here who feel

that some sort of ﬁnancial adjustment is in order. s

Miller, George Ease Mat Worries

 

By DON SCHURMAN

If a wrestling coach’s dream
is to have two champs in
every weight division, then
coach Rex Peery has had his
dream fulﬁlled in his 130-
pound contenders Harold
Miller and John George.

Two of Peery’s most reliable
matmen, Miller and George bat-
tle for starting assignments ev-
ery day of the week—-despite the
fact that they are seldom seen
apart off the mats.

High—scorer on the team last
year with a 12-2 record and a
runnerup position in the 4I’s
tournament at Cleveland, Miller
is continuing ‘his winning ways
this year with three consecutive
decisions.

George Miller’s Understudy

His latest was an important fac-
tor in Pitt’s thrilling 15-14 win
over Michigan last Saturday.

Meanwhile, George was, as he
puts it, “the trouble-shooter” last
year. “I wrestled in the 123, 130,
and 137 pound classes,” he recalls,
“and against ﬁve champs.”

This year, however, John has
been forced into the relatively in-
conspicuous role of understudy to
Miller.

Miller Posted 47 wins

Both juniors in physical educa-
tion, Miller and George are room-
mates, classmates. and even hail
from the same town,‘Washington,
Pa.

Miller, however, was enrolled in
Washington high, while George
went to Trinity high school. While
at Washington, Miller achieved
the amazing record of 47-5 and
went undefeatedin his last two
years. c

The mat “twins” then came to

Pitt where they scored undefeated
records on the undefeated 1950

freshman team.

» Relatives Active in Sport

Oddly enough, the two also got
identical starts in wrestling, both
being inﬂuenced by relatives. Mil-
ler began wrestling while still in
the eighth grade when his father,
Vincent, was a professional wres-
ler in the Tri-state district.

Harold then got his initial in-
structions under Dr. William Har-
ris who is now a well-known ref-
eree in the Tri-state area.

1 O I!

It was George’s brother, Elias,
who ﬁrst got him interested in the
mat sport. While wrestling for
Indiana, Elias became the Big Ten
champ and was twice the national
champ.

Judging from their mat per-
formances the past two years,
however, the 21-year-old mat
“twins” need not ascribe their
wrestling fame to their relatives
—-much to the pleasure of Rex
Peery. ’

To Face Solomon

Bob Hoke, sensational Michigan
State grappler, will lead the Spar-
tans in its ﬁrst meet Saturday,
testing Pitt’s Joe Solomon in the
157-pound class. _

Hoke, although a sophomore, has
already several titles to his credit.
He held the Indiana AAU, Michi-
gan AAU, and National AAU
championships in the 145—pound
class during 1951.

Solomon, Pitt’s freshman hope-
ful, is undefeated this year after
three starts. During his high
school days at Canonsburg he won
the state championship in the 145-
pound class.

Solomon in his last start gave
Michigan's Miles Lee a dislocated
elbow in Pitt’s 15-14 winover the
Wolverines.

 

Psi Omega Wins First;

By STEVE PASSAMANECK

Under the bleak lights of
Trees Gym, the Psi Omegas
hammered away steadily at
the early lead of Xi Psi Phi until
they grounded out their ﬁrst win,
22-21.

The two dental fraternities bat-
tled nip-and-tuck right down to
the ﬁnal whistle. But -the Psi O’s
had just enough of the prep school
ﬁght in them to outlast the Xi Psi
Phi’s.

Trailing 9-7 at the ﬁrst quarter

‘and 11-10 at the half the Psi O’s

paced by Elmer Stevens punched
hole after hole in the Xi Psi Phi
defense. By the end of the third
frame the Blue.-and-White had
crawled up the ladder to an 18-18
deadlock.

Tom Fee, the game's high point
man with 11. (:ouldn’t rally his Xi
Psi Phi’s as the Psi O’s wheezed
past them in the ﬁnal minutes.

to pull down the high-scoring hon-

built up a seven point 19-12 lead
at half time which proved to be
the downfall of the Mert Five.
In the ﬁrst half the .Gridders
combined a good fast break and

ﬁne rebounding by Blanda to stall

ond half the Mert Five opened up
and matched the’ Gridders point

too much to overcome and the

By DON MURDOCK
, Sports Editor ._.
A calm has set over the Pitt coach-guessing game.
A calm which is expected to develop into a tempest when
Captain Hamilton returns from the NCAA meetings held at

Cincinnati this week.

Hamilton is on ﬁve committees at the annual meet-

ing this year—the Television Committee, the Olympic

‘ Committee, the Football Coaches Committee, the NCAA
\ Committee, and the National Football Hall of Fame

A
D

Committee.

Which should keep Hamilton so
busy that the many jobless coaches
at the meeting won’t have a chance
to pester him about the Pitt va-

’ cancy.

Dawson Leading Candidate
Which brings us to the question:

Is Pitt’s coaching position still va— :

cant?

Lowell ‘Red’ Dawson, who
gave me the biggest thrill of my
four years at Pitt with his daz-
zling offense at Michigan State
this year, appears to be the No.
1 choice at the moment.

He’s Student’s Choice

If Dawson does accept the Pitt
position, he may not ‘be pleasing
the alumni but he will be satisfy-
ing’ the students, according to a
poll taken before Christmas.

A representative group of stu-’
dents‘ were‘ polled and they
agreed 100 per cent -that of the
men who were candidates, they
would accept Dawson for the
post.

Of the men who were not can-
didates at that time Earl Blaik of
Army and Hamilton received the
most votes with 90 per cent of the
students going along with Hamil-
ton.

Schoolboy Mentors Interested

. The opinion of the students with
no preference as to whether the
next coach is an alumnus. or not
centered on vNebraska’s coach Biﬁ
Glassford, and Pitt’s, Bob Tim-
mons and Edgar Jones.

Th e Western Pennsylvania
High School Football Associa-
tion, which is a powerful organi-
zation in steering high school
products to fvarious colleges,

\\

through its president, ‘Elmer
Gross of Oakmont, sent a letter
to the Athletic Committee giv-
ing their views on the head
coach at Pitt.
The result was this: if a Pitt
man was desired, their choice
would be either Timmons or Ed-

. die Baker of Tech. Since Baker

signed a Tech contract for the next
three years, his name has been
scratched.

If a non-Pitt man was preferred,
the High School coaches wanted
Sid Gilman, head coach at Cin-
cinnati. « .

Pitt in the Limelight

It‘s odd that Pitt should hold
off naming the new coach, or
maybe you can get some signiﬁ-
cance from the NCAA meeting in
Cincinnati, and Hamilton and Gil-
man being in the same city.

Pitt's hesitation in naming the
new coach has brought plenty of
publicity to the school. The eyes
of eastern United States are fo-
cused on Pitt. ,

Dawson has said that the Pitt
job is the most desirable in the

— country, but I wonder just how he

feels about the vacant football po-
sition at Indiana. '

iGridders Bill ‘Hoffman and 
dred Kraemer have joined Rex
Peery’s grapplers. The addition
gives the matmen four footballers.
Joe Kane and Harold Hunter hav-
ing joined the team earlier.

Dick Dietrich is the only
cleater to participate on the
basketball team.

Frosh-JV Seek Second

feature an interesting rivalry be-
tween two former star Panther

Pitt and George Mccrossin of

The original freshman squad
that edged W&J, 56-54, in Decem-
ber has been augmented by JV
hoopsters Chester Palesko, Alex
Novakovich, Milroy Carnahan,
Bernie Knapek and Dave Sari.
They have been weakened, how-
ever,’ by the promotion of Jim

McClure, Bill Rueschel and 

Frontone to Doc Caglson’s varsity.

Last year’s above average froah
dribblers were able only to earn

Oakland Parking Problem Solved

   

4: *  _ * ¥ 18

Pre-Med Sophomore Discovers

Only Way To Make 8:30 Classes

By DAVE WINTER

Do you have the “merry—go—round blues” from driving
’round and ’round looking for a parking space?

If you have ever been frustrated by row upon row of
cars with nary an open space within hiking distance of the
Cathedral, you’ll be glad to see the solution above.

The pictures, taken by alert Pitt News photographer
Sanford Gorby, show how pre-med sophomore Pat Logue
assured himself not one, but two parking spaces.

Believe it or not, the photo at top left is a View of
the strangely bare Bigelow Blvd. parking area. It is a
time exposure taken from the fourth floor roof at 1 a.m.,
looking from the Cathedral to Schenley Hotel.

At top right Logue is sailing into a parking lane—no
danger of scratching fenders while trying to squeeze into

a narrow spacewhile trying not to swear at impatient
horn—tooters.

At center left Logue has established squatter’s rights
to space number two, and is having a nightcap before a
cheery ﬁre. Above left Logue, snugly curled in raincoat
and sleeping bag, dreams of the reward for saving space
number two.

In picture ﬁve at bottom right, beaming‘Logue is thank-
ed by his friend, Peggy Ann Cohen, college junior.

If you doubt whether a parking space is worth the
eﬁort,.can you think of a nicer way to start the day?

Pitt Poll

Poll: “What do you think of
spring?”

According to E. A. Batchelder,
assistant University registrar, “the
fewer number of students now en-
rolled at the University doesn’t
seem to warrant an extended pre-
registration period. But if the
system doesn’t work too well, the
University may revert to using a
pre-registration period.”

it’s a big mistake. The pre-regis-
tration method used to split up all

equal parts.”

John Wallhauser, Pre-Med. ’54:
“I don’t want to go through again
what I had to last fall.”

it’s terrible. Now I can’t be slu'e

  Y‘ Of Hugh Brackenridge’s Son

Working under a recent Buhl Foundation grant, Dr.

William F. Keller of the distory department has started ex-

' tensive research on Henry Marie Brackenridge, son of Hugh
Henry Brackenridge, who founded the University.

 ’Upon concluding his research,

Dr. Keller will edit the f‘Henry
' Marie Brackenridge Letterbook,”
“which he hopes will give rise to a
formal biography. -

The idea for this project was
ﬁrst suggested to Dr. Keller
through documents and readings
.in the Darlington Library, and al-
though research is only in its in-
fancy Dr. Keller describes his
ﬁndings as’ “exciting.”

Dr. Keller, whose office is in

. the library, got his opportunity for
the research» in July, 1951, when
the Buhl Foundatiom granted a
total of $80,000 to the University
_for further research and writing
on the cultural; history of western
Pennsylvania. V . _

The history professor was
hmong other Pitt appointees to the

 research and writing program.

Work under this part of the pro-
gram covers 3 years.

He thought they were trying to make him the butt-end

of a joke when he was asked to judge cigarette mildness

with a mere’puii of one brand and a quick sniﬁ of

another. The fancy foot-work didnjt dazzlehim! He

knew that the pinnacle of pleasure comes from steady

smoking . . . and that there is only one test that gives you

enough time to permit conclusive proof. Smokers

throughout America have made the same decision!

It’s the sensible test  . the 30-Day Camel Mildness
Test, which simply asks you to try Camels on a

day-after-day, pack-after-pack basis. No snap judgments!

Once you’ve tried Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
