  Independents
  Meet for First
‘Rally of Year

Campus Politicians Set
Forth Party Objectives
At Start of Campaign

Upward of 300 undergraduate stu-

dents are expected "to converge-upon.

24 Cathedral at 12:30 o’clock today
to hear the opening gun in this year’s

"student political campaign, a cam-

paign that promises six months of
slogans, back-slapping, and
“platforms” before the fraternity-in-

‘ dependent issue is decided at the polls

next May.

The keynote of the first major In-
dependent Party ra].ly will be sound-
ed by Rugy Aldisert, C41, co-chair-
man of the meeting, who will launch
the party’s current membership drive
with an outline of the objectives and
program of the non-fraternity group
this year. .

Chairman Wants Unity

Today’s meeting will be opened by
Bill lVlcElwain, C41, chairman, who
will call for unity and renewed spirit
in the unusually strong Independent
movement that last year provided a
campaign replete with political ﬁre-

‘works, a campaign that ended with

one of the closest elections in Uni-
versity history and the near loss of
“fraternity domination” of the camp-
us, upon which Independent leaders
centered the 1938-39 campaign at-
tacks.

While today’s meeting marks the

gopening ~oaf.~.this year’s niembership

campaign, it also represents transfer
of party leadership from J. Karl
Stark, C40, and Jack Hoeveler, C40,
senior Independent leaders" and vet-
erans of last year’s stormy campaign,
to the junior membersof the party,
the leadership of whom has fallen
upon ‘Aldisert, McElwain,
Tucker, C41, and Fred Robie, C41.
Student Speakers

At today’s rally the history of the
.fraternity-independent contest will
:be reviewed,“ together with the ﬁne
‘points of student government and
politics by various student speakers
including Adele Yorio, C41; Clar-
ence Shepard, C40; Dorothy Ann. Car-
rier, Ed4l; Frank Kristufek, C40; and
Lew Riley, C42.

Keynote of the rally will be the
emphasis upon merit, which Inde-
pendent leaders declare is the guiding
principle of their group. It was re-
called this week that the merit ar-
gument bogged down somewhat last
year, when both fraternity and in-
dependent campaign heads declared
themselves in favor of “merit” as the
basis of oﬁice-holding.

Debaters Enter
Tourney Finals

Two freshman debate teams will
clash today in the ﬁnal round of the
freshman intra—class tournament on
the subject, “Resolved: That the gov-
ernment should own and operate the
railroads.”

Sidney Needleman, C, and William
Banks, C, afﬁrmative, will meet Wil-
liam Clemmer, C, and Edward Ta-
blac, C, negative, for the champion-
ship.  A

Oﬁers Prize for Best

Score in Driving Test

Five dollars awarded to the stu-
dent recciving the highest score
in the driving ..t.ests,,,.b.eiI1g given
this week by the SEA safety cam-
paign conimittee will be an addi-
tional stimulus to make I.7n.iversity
drivers “safety conscious,” ac.-
cording to David Buente, C41,
chairman of th.is year’s drive.

Students will not only have an op-
portunity to vie for this cash prize,
but test their driving accuracy as
well, with the various devices pro-
vided by the better traﬁic committee
of the city of Pittsburgh and set up
in 124 Cathedral all this week. In
addition to the testing device, the
safety committee has on hand a
quantity of literature giving driving

Steerometer used in campaign

tips and hints, and safety material.

Stickers bearing the campaign slo-
gan “When you walk, when you
drive, stay alive” will be distributed
via sandwiches in the eighth ﬂoor
Tuck Shop. Members of the com-
mittee will again distribute bumper
slogans, “so don’t worry if you ﬁnd
one on your bumper tomorrow or
next day,” Buente states.

Stickers and bumper signs will al-
so be available in 124 Cathedral.

Between showings of the regular
ﬁlms tomorrow, a 12-minute safety
ﬁlm, “The Chance to Lose,” will be
presented. Plans to use one of the
Studebaker safety cars during the
campaign were not completed in

time. ,

' Three of the devices being used to
test driving reactions are the Steero-
meter, the Glarometer, and the Quiz-
board. The Steerometer resembles
the interior of an automobile. Be-
fore it is a screen on which a high-
way is projected. The driver at-
tempts to steer the machine toward a
focal point as the highway “moves”
about giving the effect of sharp turns
in the road.

Similar to the Steerometer, the
Glarometer tests reactions to glaring
lights and traffic signals which are
flashed on a screen. The Quiz-board
contains ten driving questions, each
with four multiple-choice answers.
Green lights indicate the correct, and
the red lights, the wrong answers.

Members of the committee and
Delta Tau Delta pledges will be on
hand every day this week from 9:30
until 3:30 o’clock demonstrating the
devices. Safety announcements con-
cerning the exhibitions will be placed
in class rooms today and tomorrow.

Fund Pledges Due Soon

Community fund pledges due
December 9 will be payable at
the ground ﬂoor elevator lobby to-
morrow, Friday, and next Monday
from 9 to 4 o’clock.

While students in the various un-
der-graduate schools of the Univer-
isity groan and tear their hair in an-
ticipation of ﬁnal examinations, for
,students in the Research Bureau for
{Retail Training, exams are a thing
lof the past.

On November 24, all students of the
Bureau put away their notebooks
and pens for “active service” at the
“front.” On that date they became
full-time employees in local depart-
ment stores where they will work in
supervisory positions during the
Christmas season, ending their serv-
ice on December 23.

This four-week trial period is part
of the curriculum of the Bureau, and
is the onlyvtime the students have
an opportunity to go out and work
for any~-appreciable length of time.
lDuring this time there will be no
; class work. ’

allow the students to try out their
;abilities as executives. According to
{Miss Lillian Friedman, assistant pro-
‘fessor of personnel management,
who is responsible for assignments
and supervision of store work, “It is
an opportunity for the student to
evaluate themselves. When they re-
turn to classes in January, they will
report on their training, their expe-
which might have appeared to them

while working in the stores.”

“The Christmas season is a good
time for the students to test them-
selves, since they receive in “capsule
form” at that time almost everything
that can happen in a store,” says
‘Miss Friedman.

Approximately six people have
been placed by the Bureau in each
of the larger department stores, and
one or two in the smaller stores.
Most of the students are acting as

Reporter Discusses
Women’s Superiority
On Anniversary Date

By Ed Beige!
Crouched under an arch with a

couple of sweating photographers, I
disconsolately agreed with Chancel-

at 4:30 Monday afternoon, “Men are
now in the minority.” This was
Woman’s Day, and everybody knew
it.

Pat Elmer, C40, president of the

the ceremonies along in ﬁne style.
Wearing one of those long black
skirts and a red blouse, Miss Elmer,
alter tugging at the neck _micro-
phone, announced the supremacy of
freshman tonsils, watched the silver
service set piled up on the table-—a
gift of the women to better pour
their tea wi.th—presented a huge
birthday cake to “the men especial-
ly” and cheerfully announced, “Uni—
versity women. have waited 108 years
for this day.”

Commemorating the forty—ﬁfth
iyear of women at the University, the
‘Chancellor recalled that “men have
‘built this (the Commons) room, and
lthe Cathedral, but back of it—and
‘back of great achievements in any
ﬁeld—-is the inward light, the inspir-
ation of women. ‘

“Women put meaning in life!” he
said, “women are the delight of the
University, they put meaning into
the life of the whole University.”
Short, but to the point, the Chan-
cellor put his meaning across well;
to him went a fat piece of cake.

The Misses Stein, Lydia and Stella,
University coeds number 1 and 2
shyly admitted that coeds of today
are very well able to take care of
themselves; they’ thought Woman’s
Day-—as did Emil'Narick, Joe Kris-

Freshman Women Win
A Interclass Sing Award
With ‘Wizard of Pitt’

By Janet Green

Fan dancers, cowardly lions, and
occasional singing featured the an-
nual Interclass Sing held last Mon-
day at Heinz House.

After the four classes and the
faculty group of judges presented
skits—the freshman_ women received
the cup signifying that their take—of'I'
on the “Wizard of Oz” had won the
Interclass Sing. ’

Juniors, sing champions for the
past two years, were thwarted in their
attempt to maintain the cup for the
third year which would have placed
the trophy in their permanent pos-
session.

Freshmen Skit

The freshmen skit, whose clever-
ness won for them the tribute, rep-
resented the cowardly lion of the
original “Wizard of Oz” as a senior
staggering to the “Wizard of Pitt” in
search of a “man.” To the fresh-
men, the sophomore class was the
scarecrow looking for a brain. The
junior class took the form of a tin
man needing a heart after winning
the other sings. ‘

The freshman class was “Dorothy”
who wants recognition and ﬁnds it
by obeying the wizard’s demands that
she kill the wicked witch. The fresh-
man class had the largest attendance
and won points from the judges
through their abundance of enthusi-
asm.

Lone Ranger

In the juniorskit the other classes
were represented by horses in a rodeo
with the juniors as the lone ranger
who injected school spirit into the
J freshman horse and drove her to vic-
tory. .

The seniors presented a take-off on
the “Women” and had a larger at-
tendance and participation than they
have ever had. .

The sophomores enacted a negro
skit and had old man trouble pester-
ing the “Pitt Plantation”v-and “Alm.a
Mammy.” The other classes, as the
-sophomore showed, were unable to
do anything about the difficulty, but

We Note the Arrival

  Of an Indoor Sport

Latest game being played at the University is
“passing the buck”~—not a very new sport, but

sometimes very convenient.

lt all concerns the recent “mystery” robbery
of the YMCA Community Fund money.

_ . Two weeks ago, the mystery was “VVho com-
mitted the robbery?”

Today, the mystery is “Who’s investigating the
robbery ‘.3 ”

Enigma number one was discovered at 8 o’clock
lwednesday morning, November 22, when it was
discovered that the glass door of 801 Cathedral was
shattered and the main oﬂice of the YMCA ran-
sacked. Missing from this office was an unknown
quantity ‘ of Community Fund subscription enve-
lopes valued at some $150.

The second riddle is to determine what is being
done about the theft.

 Reported to be investigating the incident, ac-
.,cording to the ofﬁce of the dean of men, is the

“University building and grounds department.

‘ ’ When questioned as to the progress of their in-
vestigation, the building and grounds men declare
‘that the dean of men’s office is doing the job.

The only thing certain about the whole aﬁair is
that the Pittsburgh police were not called in to do
“the -job.”

My dear Dr. Hutchins:

Your University of Chicago, except in one unfor-
tunate incident, has proved that football miserably
played might serve as a more effective device to pub-
licize a university’s existence than a Class 1 team blessed
with uninterrupted victory.

I mourned with ‘you, ’Doctor, on the ‘occasion of
your team’s success over’Oberli'h’colliege,’wl‘ién  some
strange quirk of fate, cnieago =u'nwIer'é1ty‘i5rb1:;e -its per-
fect record of continuous‘ defeat. But I am sure that
I can console you by récallirfgto  ith“a“’t Oberlin was
the ﬁrst college in the wbi‘~1ii'to permit women to ‘enter
higher educational institutions fend, no doubt, to this
very day is suffering its "tragic effects.

Our Record

You know Doctor, out here at Pitt we used ‘to have
a perfect record like yours, only the other _way around.
We would win every footba'll'game of the season. Yes,
we won national notoriety for it, but the kind you got
from your team is a lot easier and much less burden-
some to maintain. It was a terriﬁc strain on us to
keep on the top of the list, while you folks simply did
nothing, and won national fame by staying at the bot-
tom.

There must be a lot to this’Greek and ‘Latin and
Philosophy which gives your university a status of su-
periority. Here, all over the country, coaches are work-
ing all their might to train great football players. Col-
leges compete to buy out the best ones, and trade and
barter to get them as they leave high school. But Chi-
cago university turns a deaf ear toiall this Worldly stuff.

Education

Instead, Doctor, ‘you c'oncentra.t’e on a new system of
education based upon rigorous study. You employ
prominent professors. ‘You ignore the protests of a
trustee, powerful and wealthy, aimed at the extraordi-
nary freedom pennitted in class discussions. You take

-your exercise by leaning over toward the other side of

your seat. And you smile in contentment as your foot-
ball team scores 32 points and ‘is scored upon by 257

‘points. ‘

And all this time students ﬂock to your University.
You are mentioned as -a. strong contender for appoint-
ment to the U. S. Supreme Court. Professors seek your
school, giving up more remuherative‘ positions, if only
tovget a placement under you. Members of your fac-
ulty win the Pulitzer prize for their achievements ‘in
science and medicine and journalism.

De-emphasis _

So you see Doctor, you may be well satisﬁed with
your educational technique. It has proved its feasi-
bility in its results, winning the respect and admiration
of educators everywhere. ‘

Well, as you no doubt know, out here at Pitt we are
die-emphasizing football. We have lost four games this,
season. But I can assure you that we are much more
at ease, and we sleep a lot better. We don’t have to
win every game. That strain is gone.

I would like to see the day come, Doctor, when we
can rank with you as the most prominent university in
the country. Of course -you know what that means.
We’ve got to work hard on our educational 'program——
work to make it vibrant, dynamic, and vigorous.

When we reach that goal, Doctor, I’ll take a grand
stand seat with you at the stadium, and as ourteams
lose swe’ll laugh and laugh to high Heaven!

By Gefbrgia Shuset
“A, little paddle can do a lot of
good!” replied Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant dean of men, in reply to the

question “Hell-week or no hell-

week?”

It all concerns the resolution

passed by the 131 delegates to the

National Undergraduate Fraternity

 convention, in session at the Hotel

Biltmorev in New York, Friday and
Saturday of last week.
Roughness Disapproved

Expressing strong disfavor of Hell
Week practices and urging frater-

nity councils throughout the couu-* 

try to cooperate with college and
‘university administrators in sub-
stituting orientation programs and
Greek Weeks for physical hazing,
the resolution hinted a strong dis-
“favor of unnecessary roughness.

Condemning “recent lapses from
good taste on the part of certain
fraternity chapters that have lent
themselves to pictorial exploitation
by cheap and sensational journal-
ism,” the conference deplored “ex-
hibitionism” that tends “to bring the
institution of the fraternity into dis-
repute.”
Publicity Harmful

“The University has never fav-
ored any sort of hazing that might
lead to casualties,” continued Mr.
Corley, “but, as long as hell-Week
activities can be confined strictly to
within the fraternity houses, there
is less chance of accidents.”

The publication and ﬁlming of
pictures giving “harmful publicity”
to fraternities and sororities was
considered “the big problem” fac-
ing the conference, according to A.
H. Aldridge, executive secretary of
Theta Chi and chairman of the as-
sociation.

"University Comment

“I, don’t think hell-week should be
abolished” said Robert Goleman,
BA42, Phi Epsilon Pi. Dick Jones,
C41, Phi Gamma Delta, expressed
the opinion that there are other
ways than paddling of making a
good fraternity man.

FIHDM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAIN
Sports Editor.

"'m‘an’s ﬁst with his (Kal’s) eye.
‘all, but not imitated.

NOW THAT THE FOOTBALL campaign is over, the gridders’
chief cause for complaint is removed. They no longer have to work
until late at night to get their 14 or m.ore hours in each week.
Almost all the boys objected to working during the season on the

‘grounds that when practice was over, their supper eaten, and their

broom manipulating ﬁnished, it was often 11 o’clock before they had
a chance to begin studying.

With no practices, the situation is relieved, but unfortunately it
will bob up again when spring drills Open. How far the boys will‘
carry their protests is debateable but the problem is at least worthy
of consideration. H
-_.As has been frequently announced by University authorities, the
University ’s ath_letic policies will be subject to changes in the future
when these changes are found necessary. It isour belief that the most
im‘ine-diate change must be the adjustment of the players’ working
hours while the “football season is in progress.

JUST A  A,-G0, popular Pittpouriist Kal “Hos.ford’s the

ball banquets in general with the emphasis on a particular banquet’

The outburst occasioned considerable usrprise from those who
had come to look on Kalwary as a champion of University institutions
and traditions. Long knownas a powerful force in the University ’s
drive for more favorable public recognition, Kalwary threw himself
into the ﬁght with a sincerity and feeling that could not be questioned.

His most obvious conitribution to the cause was during the Du-
quesne invasion. of the Pitt campus following Duquesne’s victory over
the Panthers. VVith all the fervor of a true martyr, Kalwary leaped
into a Commons Room embroglio and viciously pounded a Duquesne
His loyal action was applauded by

Thus it was that we were pained to see Ka.lwary’s bitter Words

:*last Wednesday. Can it be that like so many ﬁghters for the truth

the has slackened his efforts just when the goal is in sight? Has Mr.
Kalwary become a cynic? If this is so, we mourn the passing of a
great ﬁghter from the ranks of ‘battle. As he slouches i.n the Tuck
“Shop among empty coke bottles and fraternity women, we must point
the ﬁnger of scorn at him and say, “Think of what you might have
been.” "

IN THE DAILY ATHENAEUM of West Virginia University, we

ran across the following:

“Pitt is slipping from the top of the football pile. Perhaps they
didn’t schedule VVest Virginia because we might pull one on them
next year. Yep, the Panther’s getting to be a little catty now with
its Bowmanated po1icies.”_  _ _ A _ _

For years and years,» the Mountaineers have ‘come out of the hills
with “the team that’s -going to beat Pitt. ”‘ And “for -lyeaiis and years,
they’vc .gone_back to the ’h’ill‘s with the team -]that ",_d’id'I“_i’t. N ext year,

Winter I ntramu.ral Car 0 ens  

With Record Nu-r     

By Ben Foote

A record entry list insuring t

tory of University intramural athletics, director Ji’in'm'y ‘Potts’ ver-

satile winter sports program unveils its ‘ﬁve-st.ar card today.
From the fraternity houses on Dlithrhiige street and T>‘e_lle’ﬁe“ld

avenue, class rooms in the Cathedral that ihtiliide both day anti ‘even’-

ing students, engineering labs and""

lecture halls in Thaw and State
halls, and the chambers of the

Dental, Medical, and Pharmacy
buildings farther up in the hill, ros-
ters have come in. i

These lists bear names of over
1,000 participants representing 140
clubs and organizations vieing for
championships in basketball, table
tennis, volley ball, hand ball, and
bowling.

Today at three. o’clock, a volley
ball game and a table tennis match
in Trees Gym open the ﬁve-fronted
program. To the ‘Pi Lambda Phi
and Phi Kappa sextets and the Phi
Delta Theta and Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon ping pong artists go the honors
of lifting the lid on the winter cam-
paigns.

Later, at seven o’clock this even-
ing, the intramural cage season is

Probation Worli
Needs Money,

Says Broecker

Field Agent Discovers

County Spends More
On One Mile of Highway

By Paul Teske

Stating that Allegheny county
spends more money to pave one mile
of road than it does all year on pro-
bation service, Theodore W. Broeck-
er, chief ﬁeld agent for the probation
office of Criminal court, sounded the
keynote for the YMCA sponsored
“Institute on Crime” at Inquiry For-
um, last Monday afternoon.

Because approximately $50,000 is
the cost of one mile of highway.
Broecker believes that the amount of
money appropriated annually for the
services of the probation force is far
below what it should be.

Finding Work is Problem

Although correct adjustments of
the problems of home, neighborhood,
and marriage are necessary for suc-
cessful life in the community, accord-
ing to Boecker, the ﬁnding of work is
the main requisite. He stated that
the most important adjustment that
the released prisoner faces today is
the diﬁiculty of gaining employment,
especially with business conditions
in such a state that even responsible
persons are unemployed. The most
difficult problem of the probation of-

ﬁcer is to persuade the employers to. Lady 9: Pitt Player production of 135,6.

give work to released prisoners.”

“We must at all times co-nsder his
conduct in the light of his back-
ground, not our own, and judge him
accordng to his own standards,” said
Boecker while talking of society’s
opinion of criminals.

Probation Statistics

Although he avoided statistics as
much as possible and described the
human side of the criminal problem,
Broecker said that three out of four
of those released on probation with-
out supervision complete their proba-
tion time without being returned to
prison, and approximately 90 per cent
of the prisoners on probation with of-
ﬁcial supervision successfully ﬁnish
their period.

In concluding his talk, Broecker
mentioned the fact that a corps of
approximately 700 prominent men in
communities were being organized
into a group to serve as volunteer
probation officers, acting as “Big
Brothers” to the criminals. Because
this is a relatively new project, the
success of the venture is as yet unde-
termined, although Broecker believes
that this division must at all times
remain only an accessory to the fully-
developed group of professional
workers, as “community workers will
become disinterested in this type of
work in a short period of time.”

ROTC to Dance Friday

Advanced corps members of the
ROTC, candidates, actives, and alum-

fraternity, will dance to the music of
Ches Walters and his orchestra Fri-
day evening at the “Little Military

sored by the Riﬂes in the ballroom of
the Twentieth Century club.

Tapping of newly-appointed officers

Audiences to See Third Harm-
In Players’ ‘Counsellorwut-Luw’

When the curtain rises on “Coun-
sellor-at-Law,” Thursday night at
Foster Memorial, the audience will
see the third member of a family
carry on an acting tradition for
which it is noted.

Leo Harter, C42, in portraying the
role of Attorney Tedesco, is follow-
ingin the footsteps of his sister Mi-
riam, C40, and his brother Earl,
Med44, who co-starred in “Kind

Each of the Harters has played
character parts. In “Kind Lady,”
Miriam was a titled English woman,
and Earl was a French art critic. In

this play Leo is cast in the role of an
Italian lawyer. This part should be
a natural for him, since his fO‘_':1' years
of studying voice and violin lll Milan,
Italy, have given him opportunity to
absorb the temperament and voice in-
ﬂection of the Latin people, accord-
ing to Buell Whitehill, director of the
Players.

Too, his knowledge of French and
German have helped him to give the
correct interpretation of the half-
English, half-Italian accent, White-
hill, points out.

His partner in the law ﬁrm of Si-
mon and Tedesco is George Veinegar,
E40, who heads a cast of thirty.

“We, feel that many students are
