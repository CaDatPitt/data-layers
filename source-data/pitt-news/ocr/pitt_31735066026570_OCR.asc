When Candice Meyer attend-
ed Pitt as an undergraduate stu-
dent she lost a $700 security

, deposit for leaving her apart-

i ment unclean.

1 “I cleaned the bathroom with

 disinfectant and left it in really

 good shape. I even bought rug

‘ ' cleaner to get the stains out  I
left the place as best I could,
but I guess that wasn’t
enough,” said Meyer.

That was two years ago. and
Meyer said she is still peeved
that Lobos Management kept
her money.

With spring fast approaching,
and students looking to leave
residence halls and move into
apartments, prospective tenants
should bear in mind the legal
and financial issues tenants
confront.

Lobos Management denies
any wrongdoing with Meyer. A

On television, Fred
Rogers lives in a neighbor-
hood in the land of make
believe, filled with puppets,
little red trolleys and speedy

deliveries from Mr.
McFeely.
However,‘ when Mr.

Rogers leaves the set he
shares a neighborhood with
college students in his North
Oakland apartment-.

Yesterday, Rogers strolled
from his neighborhood, to
Pitt’s, stopping at the
University Book Center to
sign copies of his new book,
“You Are Special — Words
5 of Wisdom From America’s
‘ Most Beloved Neighbor.”

This is the fifth book that
Rogers has written in a
career that has touched three
generations of children.
While he gained his popu-
larity through his television
show, “Mister Rogers’

Neighborhood,” he is also V

the founder and president of
Family Communications
Inc., a non-profit company
that helps children deal with
serious issues, such as can-
cer and domestic violence.
Two people that grew up
on the sweaters and sneak-
ers of Mr. Rogers are Mike
Reid and Cory. Krebs, Pitt
juniors. Yesterday they wait-
ed patiently in line wit‘h
hundreds of others for their
chance to meet their hero.

he was growing‘ up in
Latrobe, Pa. was his grand-
father Fred McFeely, whom
the character on his show is
named after.

“I had grandparents who
were very, very close to
me,” Rogers said. “My
grandfather was extremely
nurturing with me, letting
me be a child.”

Rogers said his grandfa-
ther told him when he was 
young that if he didn’t 
smoke or drink until he was ’
21—years-old, he would buy
him a present. The incentive
paid off. When Rogers .
turned 21 he was given a 
boat from his grandfather, 

‘although he said it was “just l

a little one.”
°R0gers, page 4

spokesperson from Lobos said
if a tenant makes an honest
attempt to leave an apartment
clean and in good condition,
they will get their deposit back.

Meyer cited leaving numer-
ous bags of trash and a soiled
carpet as possible reasons for
Lobos Management withhold-
ing her deposit, but she said
$700 was too much money to
take out some garbage and
clean the apartment.

It is not uncommon for a
landlord to turn an unclean
apartment into a goldmine, said
Victor Scotti, a South Hills
landlord who often rents to col-
lege students.

“When you rent a place in a
huny, too many things [condi-
tion of the apartment] can go
undocumented,” he said.

UD'sgive support to cwoand Take Back the Night

ByEdAbolins

StaffWriter

Pitt’s University Democrats
endorsed the Campus Women’s

Organization’s plans to hold "a “Take
Back the Night” march in April.

According to Hayes Davis, president
of the University Democrats, the annu-
al march is organized by the CWO “in
response to the sexual assaultsand
various acts of violence that occur on
campus during the year.”

In their endorsement of the march,
the University Democrats said they
“recognize and are concerned about”
numerous acts of violence and sexual
assault on campus. Members of the

group also said they support efforts to
inform people about incidents of vio-
lence on campus and to teach people
how to avoid them.

Past “Take Back the Night” marches
have focused on protesting violence
directed towards women, but with the
highly publicized assault of a Pitt stu-
dent in January and reports of an off-
campus sexual assault two weeks ago,
support for this year’s march has
grown to include the University
Democrats.

“Now it is a march to react against
all violence on campus,” said Davis.

Davis also said the increased support
for the march is a “positive direction
forward” for the CWO.

“The CWO is not- exclusive to
women, they have many male mem-
bers,” said Davis.

Davis said he feels this is important
to realize when dealing with-issues”

that are stereotyped as “women’s

issues.”

' “Sexual assault is more than a femi-

nine issue, it’s a human issue,” said

Davis. He feels all people should be

involved in speaking out against it.
This year’s “Take Back the Night”

‘march is scheduled for April 5.

Also at last night’s meeting, the
organization made plans to take part in
this year’s Hand-in-Hand Festival to
be held in March. The club also held
nominations for new group officers.

The United Nations relief

The play entitled, “Charles and

Camilla Parker Bowles, a child-

He added that if the condition
of the apartment is undocu-
mented, when one leaves, they
can be blamed for damage that
never existed or was already
there before the place was rent-
ed.

Scotti recommended that all
renters devise a simple checklist
that documents the condition of
the apartment’s walls, windows,
floors, counters, plumbing,
appliances and carpeting.

Before renting the apartment,
the landlord should sign and
date the checklist, and when the
apartment is vacated, the list
should be signed and dated
once again. _

According to Scotti, this
gives you legal backup if a dis-

pute over any damage done to.

the apartment keeps one from
getting their deposit back.
Lobos Management and
many other renting companies
have devised these checklists to
avoid any problems.
When Meyer lost her deposit,

she thought that there was noth- _

ing she could legally do.

“My dad kept calling, and I
called, but [Lobos] kept giving
us the run around,” said Meyer.
With Christmas approaching,
Meyer said she was too busy to

Robison said Pitt students
should utilize their own
resources when dealing with
landlords. A

. Robison said students need to ,

inquire with current tenants and

previous tenants, when possi- -

ble, before signing a lease. In
addition, he said students
should never pay more than the
equivalent of two months rent
for a security deposit.
“Landlords check the refer-
ences of students as to whether
they pay their rent, so check the

references of your landlord,” he I

said.

Students especially need to
pay attention to provisions a
landlord makes prior to retum-
ing a security deposit. He said
Pennsylvania state law requires
that landlords either return the
security deposit or an itemized
list of damages to tenants with-
in one month of moving out.
Many landlords are simply
looking for ways to avoid
returning the security deposit,
he said.

Robison said he encourages
prospective tenants to photo-
graph the rooms of the apart-
ment before moving in, to
insure accurate documentation
of its condition.

Robison said students should
also be aware of the following:

All you can eat

daily specials

 

 

0 If a lease runs for more than
a year, the landlord has to pay
interest on the security deposit.

0 In courts of law, the written
lease governs. Never accept
verbal commitments from the
landlord.

0 When signing a lease, look
for two specific clauses that can
work against the tenant. One,’a
concessions judgement clause;
and two, other waiver of rights
clauses. Some leases will con-
tain clauses that waive some or
all of a tenant’s legal rights,
Don’t sign a lease with such
clauses.

Robison said he urges stu-

dents to use caution when deal-.

ing with landlords and rental
companies.

“There are a number of big
landlords, especially in

Oakland, who would no more
return a student’s security
deposit than they would walk
down Forbes Avenue naked,”
he said.

dents to misinterpret or make wrongful
judgements. While there is no inoculation
against “culture shock,” knowing what it is
and where it comes from is a step in the right
direction.

About one-fourth of the course is dedicat-
ed to educating students about study abroad
opportunities. Students are taught to evaluate
prospective programs by looking at pertinent
issues like costs, course offerings and hous-
ing options. For their first assignment, stu-
dents are asked to evaluate and select a pro-
gram that satisfies all of their own personal
study abroad needs.

Subsequent assignments help students to
become familiar with what it means to be an
international student and the idea of visiting
new environments.

The second assignment asks students to
visit a place that they have never been
before, usually somewhere local. Students
then critique their own reactions to this new
setting, paying particular attention to the
way they derive meaning and make observa-

tions. In addition, this observation exercise
helps to highlight the different value systems
people have.

In the third and final assignment, students
are required to meet and interview an inter-
national student who is currently attending
Pitt. From this assignment, students gain

new perspectives on living abroad from '

those who have already experienced it.

Class time is dedicated to addressing such
issues as communication, cultural adjustment
and value orientation. Students participate in

‘various in-class exercises, such as cross-cul-

tural simulation games, that help to foster a
better cross-cultural understanding. Once a
semester, a guest panel of students who have
already studied abroad share their experi-
ences and answer questions about what it is
like to live in a foreign country.

Students who enroll in this course can
expect to gain a better understanding of the
various facets that accompany life abroad.
This course is an excellent way for students
to get their feet wet before taking the study
abroad plunge. ‘ r -

Rogers

°From page 1

He became attached to his
grandfather at a young age
when, besides letting him be
free to be a child, they
ordered “stuff from Sears
together.” After one visit,
Rogers’ grandfather told him
something that would later
become a cornerstone for his
career.

“There’s only one person in
the world like you. And I
happen to like you just the
way you are,” Rogers said his
grandfather told him.

Phrases like those are what
make up the majority of his
new book.

“I care deeply about com-
munication, about words —
what we say and what we
hear,” Rogers writes in the
introduction. The book never
really strays from the key
idea, “You Are Special,” the
same message that has been
sent every day for 27 years on
his television show.

He writes about disciplining
and communicating with chil-
dren, and helping parents and
children deal with difficult
situations, such as “Divorces
don’t wreck children’s lives.
People do,” or “Some of my
richest experiences have
come out of the most painful
times  those were the hard-
est to believe would ever turn
into anything positive.”

Rogers’ experience with

I children doesn’t come from

only his grandfather and his
television show. He is also
ordained in the Presbyterian
Church to work with families
in the Pittsburgh area. R

Rogers has been married to
his wife Joanne since 1951
and has two sons and four
grandchildren. He said he has
no plans of slowing down or
retiring anytime soon.

Opinions
Strike out

America is not the land of opportunity. It is a land where fran-
chise owners crush their workers into the ground. Yes, the injus-
tice will never cease. ’

Or maybe it will. The ‘baseball players’ union has taken a
strong stand in protecting its members. They refuse to play until
the grossly unfair salary caps are lifted. After all, baseball play-
ers should not be constricted to low levels of compensation;
they all should be able to make upwards of $7 million a season.
And America should support the efforts of these fine upstanding
citizens to increase their quality of living.

The Pittsburgh-Post Gazette reported today that Teamsters
Local 250 said that they would honor the baseball players’ strike
and not send their workers to deliver beverages and other con-
cessions to Three Rivers stadium, if the players establish picket
lines. '

This support for these poor workers trying to eke out a better
living is laudable. After all, why shouldn’t workers on an
phourly salary, making one-tenth of the players’ salaries, be
forced to sacrifice in the name of bigger and better major league
baseball?

For that matter, why shouldn’t replacement players honor
picket lines with hired surrogate-picketers? America ought to
support these bloated egos who think we can’t get along without
them. Now we should slight the minor leaguers who are taking
this shot to move up and show their ability. This baseball strike
is the American Dream personified, with people finally having a
shot at their lifelong dream, but we don’t want that to stand. in
the way of justice for the working class.

Big Business in the United States has had a record of tram-
pling on the blue-collar worker and his rights. Although many
of these baseball players have made more in a season than most
workers will see in a lifetime, and have not produced anything
tangible, they should still be placed on their pedestal and the rest
of the working class should support them. If organized labor
can’t stand together with its brothers-in-arms — garbage men,
police officers, steelworkers and major leaguer baseball players,
shoulder—to-shoulder against the monied interests, then what is
to become of this country? -

With their batting average of .270 (which means that they
have about a 27 percent accuracy _rate), they are more than
deserving to have salaries which, like corporate CEOs, rise
without limit. Their income ‘on the side, charging $15 for an
autograph say, is not enough for them to maintain their minimal
existence.

So, support your professional baseball players. They work for
you after all and, like your fathers and grandfathers, are union
men. Their strike does not make a mockery of unionized labor at
all, instead it will be a rallying point. Oppressed workers of the
world unite! Help the ball pla-yers earn what is rightly theirs.
Otherwise, you will no longer be able to watch ticket, conces-
sion and souvenir prices rise in tandem with their salaries._

Open minds

Matt Mills wrote a Letter
to the Editor in defense of
Erika Kendra’s article on
diversity. I was thoroughly
upset after reading the arti-
cle.

In your letter, you said
how you came from Texas
and at your school there
was NO racial tension. I
would like to know how
you define “racial tension.”
How do you know that
there wasn’t any? You came
to Pitt, which as you
mentioned is known for
its diversity, and it truly is.
Just because there are many
diverse peoples, does
that mean that there isn’t
any racial or ethnic tension?
America is viewed for
its rugged individualism

and its “melting-pot” theory

when those in control,
meaning the white middle-
class male, never truly
accepted minorities into
America, and never truly
viewed them as equal?

The Black Action Society
does bring awareness to the
University. What’s wrong if
Mr. Marcus Gray is in love
with his Africana Studies
classes, his African cultural
center and Afrocentricity?
Don’t people in America
have freedoms to express
themselves in a positive
way?

Why do you express that

-- he is angering EVERYONE?

How will people truly rec-
ognize the years of frustra-
tion and oppression that
minority groups have faced
since they have come to
America?

Diversity does not have to
mean segregation. I hope
that you will "go and truly
view how you feel about
race, politics and the real
life reality of diversity.

Disclaimer wrong

I am writing in response
‘disclaimer’ that
appeared in The Pitt News
next to Mary Koch Ruiz’s
letter. She was informing
you of the impact. your arti-
cle had on the life of that
victim. You must assume
responsibility for the detri-
mental effects your article
had.

When the crime is sexual
assault, there is a general
inquiry intothe circum-
stances of the cri-me, and
if the victim has done

anything to make herself,

vulnerable then she is
blamed for the assault. In
essence, she is told “You

asked for this. Be smarter-

next time.” But the blame
always rests, 100% with the
perpetrator.

What you did when you
printed that article was not
education. You published
very specific information
that would allow anyone
associated with this crime to
figure out who the victim in
question was. That is a clear
violation of the victim’s pri-
vacy and it does put her in

danger of receiving further‘

abuse.

One in fourwomen will be _

sexually assaulted in their
four years in college. Over
80% of sexual assaults are
perpetrated by someone the
victim knows. Alcohol is
associated with a lot of sex-
ual assaults. The
Department of Public Safety
statistics show the number

of of rape/indecent assault

cases to be less than 10 per
year between the years 1991
and 1994. There is a lot of
distrust that the University

does not take these reports

seriously and the University
will not protect the identity
of the victim. ’

Police need help

Regarding the “Police. ‘

should Patrol” letter by L.C.
Dennis: the “police officers”
referred to throughout the
letter are in fact NOT police
officers. They are security
officers, who are not armed,

“not empowered to make

arrests and ARE specifically
assigned to check identifica-
tion at the front door of
Trees Hall as well as mak-

ing periodic checks through- .

out the interior of the build-
ing. "

At the same time, there
are usually anywhere from
eight to twelve more police
officers assigned to actively
patrol the campus via car,
bicycle and foot. It is indeed
their responsibility to
respond to the report of
criminal activity (e.g.
“assault”) — but someone
needs to notify the police
(dial 4-2121 or utilize an
emergency phone) in order
to ensure these officers
respond. Unfortunately, in
the instance cited by the
writer of the letter — no one
ever called.

We most certainly are
interested in trying to pre-
vent crime from occurring,

‘but we do need the active

assistance of victims and
witnesses. ‘

One means by which
future victims can be spared
is to give us an opportunity
to identify and arrest those
responsible for committing
the offense. To do that, Ms.
Dennis, either you or your
“friend” has to pick up the
phone and call. ‘
Rick Boyd, Director of
Public Safety.

”Computer |iterate"

s recently discussed on this page by fellow writer
Mr. Segal, the charging onslaught and ommpres-

nce of the computer is inevitable. Along with the

‘ computer are many other technologies and innovations

that usurp and gain dominance in ourlives. Upon accep-
tance and proper use, any new gizmo can contribute to
our lives and be a beneﬁt. We should congratulate our-
selves when there’s a match made from heaven, Hewlett
Packard or IBM.

It is also true that sometimes the match is made more
from hell and that many choose not to use the new inven-

' tions. There are many people that don’t know , and care

not to know, how to use a computer. Sometimes these
individuals are referred to as “computer illiterates.” I think
that this is a misnomer. A more appropriate label is
“Invention Inquisitive.”

People who don’t use computers and other modern
inventions typically ask many questions as. they’re search-
ing for reasons for using the new invention. They need
numerous reasons why they should start using the new
item. _

For example, to ﬁnd a business that is not computerized
seems like a throw back to the days of the abacus.
However, I know a quaint, prosperous little&pub that still
takes all its orders on plain slips of paper. The transactions
are later balanced in good old hard-copy ledgers. In other
words, “the books,” are actually books! The owners of the
pub are very happy with their “system.” V

The “technologically challenged” are not just people
with or without computers. Other people have never used
a microwave and actually prefer to cook on a stove.
Should they be referred to as “microwave morons?” No,

these people are smart enough to appreciate a salubrious,
slow simmer versus a nuclear-waved wake. Their nose
knows the pleasant smells produced from a simmering
pot. Taste buds are teased and the teeth wait to chomp.

It’s a different body part that knows the microwave. The
ears know the microwave. Regrettably, there’s not any
possibility of salivating over an auditory aroma. Instead, a
high-pitched whirl erupts, the ears feel violated and the
food’s been erupted to levels just below explosion. Tasty?
If that’s tasty, just cook your cinnamon rolls with solar
power next time! The microwave treats the taste buds like
a Pavlovian dog. “Insert food, boy; press numbers; listen
for high pitched sound... down, boy, down!”

Invention inquisitive individuals are aware that new
technologies and inventions are not an absolute necessity.
This is not to say that they do not use new inventions.

They just make judicious choices over the inventions that P

they use during their daily life.

Velcro is an example. The same pub that runs without a
computer wouldn’t be sticking around without Velcro.
The owners happily use Velcro to attach the daily special
to the bottom of the menu. It’s a joyous affair when the
cook detaches “Monday’s Meatloaf’ from the menu and
then slaps ‘”l"uesday’s Turkey” on the waiting Velcro grill.

In a mere two seconds the change is done and the cook
triumphantly returns to the kitchen. There he stands, with
a victorious smile on his face, poised and ready to arm
himself with his spatula, which hangs close by on a Velcro
hook. Occasionally, this same cook sometimes runs out
of eggs. But, no big crisis. Thecook will just run out, and
as he says, “go visit Mother Hen.” But it’s raining outside.
However, I’m convinced that in this situation the cook

  6

misnomer for invention inquisitive

grabs for his second favorite invention — a button-push-
ing, auto-opening umbrella. With the ﬂexof the biceps, he
gracefully unstraps the umbrella’s Velcro. VV1th the press
of his thumb, the umbrella snaps open, shielding him
from the rain as he charges outside for the eggs.

Minutes later he returns. He motions to the customers
that the omelets are on their way, and by the way, has
“anybody seen the remote control for the big screen TV?”

“My goodness,” I think to myself. Is “Sam the Cook”
the Solomon of high technologies? The guy is as happy as
a rechargeable battery with the technologies and inven-
tions. he has decided to let into his life. He’s selected
inventions that rejuvenate and make his life much easier.
Even though his selections aren’t exactly going to win
first prize at the science fairs of tomorrow, they have had a
positive impact for him today.

This positive impact seems to be the central reason for
people deciding to use a new technology. If the technolo-
gy makes their life easier,» then it gets used. For the most
part,‘ it’s an arbitrary decision.

Some people must own a computer. Others are happy
with paper and pencil. I remember when I had to have a
VCR to record my favorite television shows. Now, I only
use the thing as a video player.

It is a struggle decidingwhat new technology and
inventions I should use. It’s even harder to suggest their
usage to other people. For example, I do believe that a
computer system would help the pub, but I dare not men-
tion it. You see, Sam sometimes lets me be master of the
remote.

Co|umnist's love for baseball

u r i n g
All-Star
weekend

in July, I visited
the “FanFest” in
the David
Columnist Convention
Rick Center and had
Nowlin a blast. I’ve
been an avid
Pirate fan since the 1970 sea-
son (the year they became
consistently good - and of
course the next year brought
victory in the World Series),
and it was great to relive some
old memories. But there were
more than just the memories
that came back.
What also came back was

my desire to play baseball.’

That may sound strange to
most of you, especially in a
day when organized baseball
has taken a number of hits (no
pun intended), from lack of
participation at the youth level
to the current :trike by major
leaguers; and I’ve actually
played much more basketball’
and volleyball. However, base-
ball is, and always will be, my
favorite sport, both to play and
to watch. I’m not so much ‘a
fanatic to ask to be buried in a
Pirate uniform, but I’m cer-
tainly loyal to that black ‘n’
gold crew. Indeed, I’d still
rather play than watch the
game - unfortunately, I never
really had that much of a
chance to do so.

1972 was my first year of
Little League at the Shadyside
Boys’ Club (no girls at the
time), and I played center field
for the Mets. I was a strong
hitter (I batted cleanup) with a
lot of speed. and a good arm
but an iron glove - a la Jose
Canseco. Somehow I won the
Most Valuable Player that sea-
son.

I found, however, that I
wasn’t encouraged to play
baseball or, for that matter,
any other sport. For openers,
my father forbade me to bat
left-handed, even though I was
always a better hitter from that
side of the plate — in fact, as I
think about it now, that may
have been part of the reason.
(At 14, I ignored that and also
became an infielder.) He also
told me he didn’t think that
one should play competitive
baseball until the age of 16 —
a silly statement made, I think,

i to discourage me from playing

altogether. Whatever, I spent
two abbreviated years as
a Pony Leaguer, getting into
only two games, and I haven’t
put on a uniform since.“ Colt
and American Legion ball
passed me by in favor of acad-
emics. ’

I thought about trying out
for the team at Wilkinsburg
High during the spring of my
junior year‘(the first year I had
the time), but that quickly
came to a halt the previous
fall. You see, Dad had gotten
into an argument with the
coach of the freshman football
team, which my ' brother
played for, and as a result, my
brother’s playing time was
curtailed. He was also the
baseball coach, so I_pretty
much figured that I wouldn’t
get a fair shot with the base-
ball team, so I didn’t bother to
come out. (At my class
reunion last year, I learned that
I was probably right.) And by
thetime college rolled around,
I got involved with other

things, andby this time games-

were hard‘ to come by.
So what made me think I
still have what it takes? Well,

about five years ago I discov-
ered a batting cage about four’

blocks from my former apart-

ment in Wilkinsburg, so just to _

prove to myself that I could
still hit, I decided to take a
shot at it. Within a few weeks,
I was hitting the daylights out
of the ball and visiting the
cage at least once a week.
Now, that’s certainly no sub-
stitute for live pitching, but
when you’re swinging and
missing a 75—mph fastball
because you’re out in front of
it, well, your ego takes over.

I have no qualms about how
far I’ll go playing baseball. I

, have only average speed now,

with only an average arm,
although my fielding has
improved tremendously. I’m

obviously too old for the pros,’

and even if I weren’t, I look
these days more like a beer-
leaguer than a major—leaguer.

But even a competitive soft—.

ball league with -former base-
ball players wouldn’t do for
me - hitting and fielding a
softball don’t constitute much
of a challenge for this con-
firmed baseball. junkie.

Yet I would still like to play,
very much. I’ve heard that
there are leagues for men 30-
and-over, and I’d be interest-
ed. If anyone needs a 34-year-
old switch-hitting third base-
man with creaky knees, call
me this spring ——- I’d even be
willing to serve as a designat-
ed hitter (though I think the
position is a bastardization of

the sport). Even though I’
'haven’t played a full season of

organized ball in 22 years, I’d
like to give it a shot. There’s
nothing like chasing a dream
—— and playingfbaseball is still
one of mine.

To borrow the phrase from
NBA promos-, “I love this
game!”

Rick Nowlin isa columnist for
The Pitt News.

espite the definite
_ advances of the last
few decades, feminism

still tends to be a dirty word.
Men and women alike per-
ceive feminists in a quite neg-
ative light. On the one hand,

‘ they are seen as ranting, asex-

ual, male-bashing femi-nazis.
The polar opposite of this

depiction, however,'is that of '

helpless victims who would
prefer to seclude themselves
in safe all-female groups
where they can remain
undamaged by the evil men of
the world.

There are extremists in any

segment of the population, so
it would be safe to say that
some women would fall into
these categories. Most femi-
nists, however, are simply
ordinary women who wish to
have the same opportunities as
any other human being.

People such as Rush
Limbaugh have attempted to
portray feminists as threats to
American society. A woman’s
quest for empowerment
should not be something to
fear. In our capitalistic society,
every person strives to
become the best that he or she
can be. All obstacles that
would hinder a person of any
age, gender, race, ethnicity,
religion, etc., should be elimi-
nated. Everyone should have
the right to enter the competi-
tion on an equal ‘footing.

The outcome, however,
should be left alone. Women’s
gain should not be made at the
expense of others. I personally
would not be able to stomach
thejprospect of gaining a posi-
tion due only to a need to fill
a quota for my gender. I want
to deserve what I receive. Not
only do I want to take respon-
sibility for my positive
aspects, but I also want to be

held accountable for my mis-
takes, unpleasant as that may
be.

This leads me to the topic of
victimization. There are a
number of feminists who,
while claiming to desire
equality, attempt to push
blame for their situations onto
the shoulders of men.

Women are hardly alone in
this trend. Victimization is an
American societal fad. It is
unreasonably prevalent in this
country. We are citizens who
hold our right to sue (for
every real or imagined wrong)
quite clear ‘to us.
Unfortunately, people who are
unwilling to take on responsi-
bility are consequently
accorded little, if any, respect.

Women need to prove their
worth not by whining, but by
establishing their worth. Both
men and women should be
allowed the same chances to
succeed, but if a man is the
best applicant for a job, he
should be the one chosen to

do it. While a man who rapes _

is most definitely at fault,
women should‘ not feel that
they have free reign to behave
as they please in all situations.
A mugger should be put in
jail, but the person who was
walking down a dark alley
alone in the middle of the
night should-recognize the
stupidity of his or her actions.
Feminism_is the empower-
ment of women, and empow-
erment includes being mature
enough to recognize one’s
shortcomings and mistakes.
There is no reason that any
woman should be too embar-
rassed by the label of feminist
to proclaim her own self-
worth. Long live the f—word.

New teams
wi enhance
competition
in Big East

Columnist I ith
 the
Ziegenfuss m a

jority of the
sports at the University of
Pittsburgh having put the
wraps on their respective
seasons, I feel that it is
time to look into the crystal
ball and see
ahead for Pitt sports.

The biggest thing that
will happen is that next
season three schools will
join the Big East
Conference. Two ——
Rutgers and West Virginia,
will join as all-sport mem-
bers. The third, Notre
Dame, will participate in
all sports except football.

What does this mean to
sports at Pitt? -

Let’s start with football.
This bigger and better Big
East means nothing
because Rutgers and WVU
are already members of the
football conference, and

Notre Dame football has -

not sunk to the depths of
.having to play in the Big
East.

Moving on through the
fall sports, women’s vol~
leyball and soccer will see
the level of their competi-
tion increase with the addi-
tion of these new schools.
Notre Dame has been ‘a
powerhouse in both sports
in the past and they figure
to remain strong into the
future. p ' 4

Moving on to the winter
sports. Men’s basketball
already plays West Virginia
and it has turned into a
good rivalry that should
only strengthen now that
they must play each other
twice a season. Notre
Dame and Rutgers are both
weak programs that will fit
in nicely to Pitt’s future
schedule. -

Women’s basketball did
not play any of the three
new teams this season, so
next year will be its first
look at the new Big East.‘

In swimming and diving,
the Pitt men and women
have blown West Virginia
out of the pool the last few
years. Notre Dame had a
strong program in the past
and Rutgers will be in the
thick of the competition.

In track and field the
Panthers already compete
at West ‘Virginia, and the
Pitt speedsters should be
ready to cruise past
Rutgers and Notre Dame at
the conference champi-
onships. _

what lies,

Pitt lets another slip away,

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer

With one second remaining
in regulation, Pitt point guard

Andre Alridge had a chance"

to break a 63-63 deadlock
against the Miami Hurricanes
last night at Miami. The shot
hit the front rim and, with the
miss, so went Pitt’s chances
for victory.

The Hurricanes outscored
the Panthers 13-5 during
overtime as Pitt lost 76-68,
dropping its overtime record
to 0-3 for the season. '

“I knew we weren’t going
to win in overtime,” head '

coach Ralph Willard said.
“Miami had the fresh legs and
we didn’t.’’ ‘
The loss drops the Panthers’
‘record to 8-16 overall, with a
4-12 Big East record. The win
raises the Hurricanes’ record
to 14-10 (9-8), and ensures
Miami of finishing at least
.500 in conference play for
the first time in team history.
The first half. of play was
controlled by the Panthers.
Miami’s only lead of the half
came at the 9:02 mark when
Steve Fraser capped a 9-2
Hurricane run to give Miami
a 19-18 lead. V

The Panthers responded
with a 9-0 run highlighted by
Jaime’ Peterson’s three-point

play. With 5:38 remaining in -

the half, Pitt enjoyed a 27-19
advantage.

Sometimes when a small-town
kid fresh out of high school gets
his ﬁrst taste of life in the big city,
there’s a period of adjustment
until the kid hits his stride. In
time, everything settles down and
the kid performs the way every-
one expects him to.

It’s a familiar situation to many
kids when they leave their small
rural hometowns and get out on
their own for the ﬁrst time.

The same was true for Pitt,
wrestler James Joseph Fasnacht,
J.J., as he’s known to his friends-
and family. , ’

Fasnacht comes from the small
town of Tremont, Pa., a town -
about two hours north of Hershey.
It was there that Fasnacht began
his wrestling career while in the
seventh grade and developed into
a three-time PIAA place-winner,
and winner of 140 matches‘ at
Pine Grove High School.

Fasnacht credits his high school
coach, Dwane Maurer, with being
his biggest influence in his
wrestling career.

“He was an All-American in
college and a real good high
school coach,” Fasnacht said.
“He made me want to wrestle

Maurer’s encouragement lead
to three—day-a-week training in
the summer that helped refine
Fasnacht’s wrestling skills.

With all the success in high
school, time soon came to decide
on a college to attend.

“At first only small schools
such as Edinboro and Clarion
were offering me scholarships
early on,” Fasnacht said. “Pitt
was the first big school to offer
me a scholarship, so I signed up

early.”

Fasnacht embodies the image
many people have living in small
towns. He’s friendly, polite and
doesn't have an ounce of cocki-
ness in him. Fasnacht’s attitude
goes back to his upbringing in
Tremont.

“When I ﬁrst went to meet his
family, his parents, (James and
Marrianne), held the door wide

open for me,” Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “They
made me feel as though they’d
give me the shins off their back.”

Fasnacht’s first year at Pitt p

wasn’t exactly what he had in

mind when he chose Pitt.

“My freshman year I was 6-
12,” Fasnacht said. “I was really
homesick my ﬁrst year here.”

“Most kids stay there their,

whole lives,” Stottlemyer said.
“He took a big chance coming
here and struggled at ﬁrst.

After settling into his new envi-
ronment, Fasnacht rebounded last
year, racking up 33 victories and
qualifying for the NCAA cham-
pionships.

This season became a break-
through season for Fasnacht as he
led the Panthers in victories with
26.

Fasnacht’s back-to-back big
seasons comes as no surprise to
his head coach. V

“He’s a great kid,” Stottlemyer
said. “He has a tremendous work
ethic, he’s always busting his
hump in practice.”

b With success came an ascen-
sion into a leadership role on the
Panther wrestling team.

“I try to be a leader, but I’m not
a perfect leader,” Fasnacht said. “I
try to pick up my teammates with
encouraging words, but I don’t

Fasnacht hopes to get a. No. 1
seed at the tournament, which
would give him a better shot at
making it to nationals next
month.

Although a history major now,
Fasnacht hopes to enter Pitt’s
health school and receive a
degree in physical education.

Fasnacht’s dream is to some
day return to his old high school
and coach wrestling and work
with the kids.

“I want to coach high school
kids so ”I can be a part of their
wrestling careers,” Fasnacht said..

Pitt can be thankful for quickly
signing Fasnacht and sticking
with him through his freshman
year. ‘Because with the tough
times behind him, the future
looks bright for this small town
kid.

sion. The five-point posses-
sion trimmed Pitt’s lead to 31-
26.

“We were in control. That
turned the momentum,”
Willard said. “The refs said
they shouldn’t have called the
technical after the game.”

After a bucket by Jason
Maile, the Hurricanes closed
the first half with a 5-0 run to
cut the gap to 33-31 Pitt.

The Panthers shot 14 of 27
(52 percent) on the half, with
18 points coming off of 12
Miami turnovers. Peterson led
the way with nine points, fol-
lowed by Gant and Maile
with six points each.

Miami’s monstrous center
Constantin Popa was shut
down by the Pitt' defense,
scoring just two points.

As the second half started,
the Hurricanes quickly
grabbed their second lead of
the contest, going-up 34-33 on
a three—pointer by Dunn.

Antigua, Peterson commited
his fourth foul of the game at
the 17:11 mark.

The action went back and
forth until Pitt unleashed the
threes. First, Gant nailed his
third trey of the season and
Pitt trimmed Miami’s lead 43-
42. After a Miami bucket by
Rich, Garrick Thomas and
Sotiris Aggelou drained con-
secutive treys and Pitt led 48-
45 with 11:00 remaining.

One of the most exciting
moments of the game came
when Gant, with 10:07 left,
used a spin move to go
around a Miami defender,
shot the layup, was fouled,
and converted the free throw.
Pitt led by five, 51-46.

Miami stormed back with a
8-0 run highlighted by Norris’
around—the-back, half-court
pass to Fraser, who scored the
easy bucket. The Hurricanes
recaptured the lead, 54-51.

Pitt clawed back with a 7-0
run to reclaim the lead at 58-
54, after Gant nailed the back
end of two foul shots.

On Miami’s subsequent
possession, Maile received his
fifth foul with 2:24 remain-
ing, trimming the number of
scholarship players to six.

With 1:09 remaining in reg-
ulation, Pitt’s lead looked
comfortable at five, 61-56.

As has been the case all
season, Pitt seemed to find a
way not to win.

Alridge, the Big East’s sec-
ond—leading foulshooter at 84
percent, missed two crucial
foul shots down the stretch,
giving the Hurricanes an
opportunity to tie.

“If Andre makes the free
throws, the game is over,”
Willard said. “But the man
was exhausted.”

With 8.7 seconds remain-
ing, Popa scored on a layup to
knot the score at 63-63. Pitt
had one more shot to win.

Alridge dribbled the court
and forced the three that fell
short.

“That wasn’t the shot we
wanted,” Willard said. “We
were looking for an easy
bucket, but Andre shot the
three.”

The overtime was just a for-
mality as the Panthers’ legs
gave out. .

Willard said he was still
proud of his players for giv-
ing their all once again.

“The refs said they never
saw a group of kids play as
hard without getting reward-

 " ed.”

The last chance for a
reward for the Panthers
c'omesSaturday against Seton
Hall‘, who are fighting for a
NCAA Tournament bid.

Wrestling and gymnastics
do not matter here because
no Big East conference
exists for these sports, and
West Virginia is already a
member in the same
leagues as Pitt. '

.Now onward to the
spring sports of baseball
and tennis. The Pitt base-
ball team, which won the
Big East regular season
title last year, plays West
Virginia each year. Rutgers
and Notre Dame can only
strengthen the conference
that desperately needs
Miami to join it.

In tennis, West Virginia

has provided more than
enough competition to Pitt
in the past. The rivalry
should continue, and the
two other schools will no
doubt meet up with the rac-
quet-wielding Pitt team
somewhere down the road.

The Big East has decided
that expansion is in the
best interest of its future.
For Pitt, the competition
should get stronger, and
maybe some new rivalries
will develop to provide Pitt
fans with some excitement
in the future.

sional, high school and col-
lege athletes.

The women’s tag team
combination of Ayne Allen,
Joetta Purter, Najuma
Fletcher and Angie Martin
set one of those records in
the 4 x 400 relay, hitting
their best time of 3:43:31
to earn a second-place fin-
ish.

Fletcher went solo to
compete in the high jump
to set another school record
with a leap of 5-11.25 to
finish in seventh place in
an event that included only
two collegiate athletes.

Not to beforgotten was.
the men’s tag team combi-
nation of Dietrich Jells, Jay
Jones, Jay Murphy and
Curtis Anderson, who set
the third school record of
the day, to earn a second-
place finish, hitting a time
of 1:27:00 seconds.

“The meet is set up for
the professional elite and
only the top collegians are
invited,” Lewis said.

But even with the tough
competition, the Panthers
managed some good per-
formances.

If you want performance,
check out the women’s tag
team of Zenia Ayrton,

.— Tonya Mullins, Shana
Fadis and Lakeya Smith,
who ran the 4 x 200 relay,
hitting a time of 1:40:17
seconds to earn a fourth-

place finish.

Ayrton also went soloto
run in the women’s 55-
meter dash where she
equaled her best time of the
season (7.00) to take fifth
place.

“Different meet, different
strokes,” coach Lewis said.

But fourth—year man
Dietrich Jells couldn’t tell
the difference in the men’s
55-meter dash, where he
placed fifth and hit a time
of 6.39 seconds.

“This is one of the best
teams we’ve ever had for
the men,” Lewis said. “And
we're pretty dog—gone good
with the women.”

But what do the Panthers
have to look forward to?

“We’re looking to
improve our times again,”
Lewis said. '

The Panthers will be
splitting up next weekend
as the men will head to
Princeton for the Inter-
Collegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of
America Championships.
The women will be headed
to the Eastern Collegiate

Athletic Conference
Championships in
Syracuse. .

“We have a good shot at

placing in the top three in A

bOth,” Lewis said.

The championships will
“include 125 teams from the
East Coast.
