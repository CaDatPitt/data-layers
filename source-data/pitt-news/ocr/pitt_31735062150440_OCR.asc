George Sobel, Ed. 234, was the

' latest victim of the -thieves when w

$25 was removed from his locker-
at the gym last Thursday. A com-
panion of Sobel also lost 36 from;
the same locker. _ . . 
Determined to curb the series of
thefts, the office of the dean of
men, together with Prof. ‘John
Dambach, director of physical edu-
cation, is taking drastic steps to
apprehend the ‘culprit. _

is apparent that unscrupulous per-
sons have been able to gain admis-
sion, to certain University ‘bulld-
ings. This is evidenced by the loss’
of ‘articles by persons, who could

‘have lost them only by theft. “On,

one or ‘two occasions, lockers" in the‘)
gymnasium secured by locks which
were of ﬂimsy construction were

broken open and, the contents;

riﬂed. ' U
“Professor Dambach has taken

.th,.e,gui1ty party but so far without;
success. In this he has the co-
operation of Student Council.

that everyone may be aware oflthei.
circumstances and cooperate as ‘far
as possible. in identifying the thief
and bringing him to justice. The
administration is bending’ every‘ ef-
fort to this end but considers it ad-.
visable, for obvious reasons, to
make no statement as to its method
of procedure.” ' - «

, “Petty thievery is a problem with
which th,eﬂUniYersity finds itself
confronted every year. Careless-
ness on the part of students who
fail to provide adequate locks for
their lockers or leave belongings

quently invlte robbery,” according
to William‘ Daufenbach_ assistant
to the deanjofmen. “The Univer-
sity buildings are open until late in
the evening and it is entirely pos-
sible for outsiders to, gain‘ admis-
sion,” he added.

It was pointed out that one par-
ticular brand Of lock has a uniform
key. which makes it possible for
any person possessing this key to
open all other locks of that partic-
ular make.

Climax Week

National Program, Closed
at Banquet Last Night

In its first observance of Nation-
al Pharmacy Week, the School of
Pharmacy climaxed a round of ac-
tivities at a banquet, held in the
Georgian Room of Webster Hall,
last night, at which .250 guests
were present.

The week's activities included
demonstrations explaining the be-
havior of common drugs, the prep-
aration of several educational win-
dow displays by pharmacy stu-
dents, four special lectures to phar-
macy students by Dr. Anton Hog-
stad, Jr., a faculty dinner, and last
night’s banquet.

The principal display, on view in
the lobby of Jenkins’ Arcade, was
prepared by Dr. Hogstad, who
came here from St. Louis in the
interests of National Pharmacy
Week. It consisted of continuous
demonstrations, from Monday to
Thursday, of the behavior of com-
monly-used but little-understood
chemicals, and an exhibition of an
individual worker ﬁlling prescrip-
tions without outside interference.

Prepare Displays

Dr. Hogstad also prepared a dis-
play in the window of a downtown
pharmacy depicting the “Story of
Cinchona——Quinine Bark."
Students who prepared exhibits
for local pharmacies were: L. H.
Kramer, W. H. Baker, Henry
Lange, Howard Klaus, Melvin W.
Greene, Paul Smoller, Edward
Mzarkowitz, and Nathan Meyers, all

Speakers at last night's banquet
included: Dr. ‘ . A. Koch, dean of
the School of _harmacy; Herbert
Mays, editor of the American Drug-
gist; Dr, Louis Saalbach, profes-
sor of Pharmacy; Henry Brown,
president of the Pennsylvania
Pharmaceutical Association; Dr. I.
H. Alexander, president-elect‘ of»
Allegheny County Medical Asso-
ciation; Dr. Anton Hogstad, Jr.,
and Melvin Green, ’32, represent-
ing the student body. Dr. C. Lea-
nord O'Connell, associate dean of
the School of Pharmacy, was toast-
master.

Faculty members of the School
of Pharmacy were dinner guests
of Dr. Hogstad ~ at. the William
Penn Hotel, Tuesday evening.

Coach Richard Murphy and Al-

ing team, which meets the Univer-
sity of Nottingham graduate team
this winter, have removed their
formal clothes and classical speech
from the hypothetical (?) moth
balls in anticipation of the interna-
tional intercollegiate debate.

International debates have the un-
questionable savor of formality, the
matching of English with American
wits; and audiences of society “just
too tickled to hear English chaps
from Nottingham.” The English
boys will wear full dress.

When Oxford came here for a
debate in 1924, they dismissed op-

To Talk Down English

 

bert Levin of the graduate debat-'

posing arguments with cleverly con- '-

ceived jokes. The subject was the
child labor question. Malcolm Mc-
Donald, son of the present English
Prime Minister, was the leading
personality of the English team.
He spoke in favor of child labor,
contrary to his father's political af-
ﬁ'liatio_ns and beliefs.

This year's debate question,
though not definitely worded, will
concern unemployment insurance
and the dole system. Pitt's de-
baters~are- fairly familiar with the
phases of this question. Mr. Mur-
phy may not use any jokes to fore-
stall the Nottingham debaters but
it is possible that at therheat of
the debate he will nonchalantly
light his pipe.

Lucilfe Ready for
Ha.milton’s Radio. Voice Landed By
Jessica Dragonette

 

Sophomore’ Miss

 
  
 

‘a

T

By LEONARD E. MENDLOWITZ

After forcing a precarious way backstage in Duquesne Gardens dur-
ing the Radio Show to gape at andcadmlre the one and only Jessica
Dragonette, whom did we see there in the intimate presence of the
prima donna but Lucile Hamilton, one of the highlights of our French
5 class? But how did Lucile get there, and why did Jessica seem to
favor Lucile more than any of the numerous admirers who had also got-

ten backstage ?

We decided to ﬁnd out.

The next scene
ﬁnds Lucile and us in Alumni ‘Hall
poring half-heartedly over French
idioms. The young lady, just eight-
een, sophomore in the college,
member of Delta Delta Delta, lifts
up two beautiful blue eyes and——
yawns. '

“By the way, Lucile, what were
you doing backstage last night?”
we inquired.

“I’ll take vanilla, on account I
like vanilla,” quotes the co-ed in
question.

This leads to a brilliant, eloquent
speech or argument from which we
emerge victorious. (And we never
took a course in Public Speaking,
either!) Lucile breaks down_ and
confesses the whole truth. the sub-
stance of which follows:

While Lucile was still going to
South Hills High school, she took
part in that institution's dramatic
activities. ~

The .high school career passed,
but the dramatic career lingered.
Lucile plays the piano in a manner
of which Percy Grainger or even
Paderewski might approve. There-

in our playlet¢

have heard the‘ famous team of
“Wilda and Lucile" often on KDKA,
WCAE and KQV, the Wilda half
being one Miss Morris, and the
other, the subject of our-‘interview.

Last summer, lLucile met Jessica ‘ -

Dragonette in New York. When

Jessica came to the radio show in‘

Pittsburgh she insisted upon hear-
ing Luci_le’s contralto voice. No
less an authority than Miss Drag-
onette says that Lucile has an ex-
tremely appealing voice, a voice
whose timbre is particularly favor-
able to radio broadcasting. The
great radio star predicts a success-
ful career for our Lucile.

And so we have in our midst 9.
potential radio star, whose name
may someday shine in the starry
iirmament as brightly as that of
Jessica Dragonette. Our only com-
ment is that television would great-
-ly enhance Lucile’.s possibilities,
for who could resist the appeal of
a beautiful‘ blon'de_ with big blue
eyes, a dainty little mouth, and a
lovely voice? Keep your eye on
Lucile; it isn’t hard!

The Interfraternity Conference

— which was held in this university
‘ last week-end, the ﬁrst ever held

here. has increased fraternity spir-
it considerably and brought out

many constructive suggestions, ac-
cording to Dean R. C. Clothier.
The conference consisted of four

H major events: a banquet at the Uni-

Problems" headquartered at sever-
al of the fraternity houses Satur-

Three hundred fraternity men

’attended the banquet. This num-
,ber included two representatives
from Allegheny, two rom, West

‘Virginia and eight from Carnegie

Tech. Three outstanding men in
tlieifraternity world spoke: Cecil

ideal Fraternity;” Dr. Francis W.

' Beta Theta Pi, talked about “Inter-
kitraternity Fellowship;’’ and Chan-

cellor John G. Bowman, Sigma Chi,
discussed the “Opportunities of a
Student in a Fraternity."

‘The speakers at the banquet led
round table discussions at several
of the fraternity houses «Saturday
morning. Each of these discus-
sions brought out constructive sug-
gestions to make the fraternities
better institutions. Theodore W.
dean of
men, visited each of the houses
and reports that everywhere the
men displayed excellent spirit and

“ that many constructive suggestions

cropped out. At each house the
representatives took notes which
will be compiled and sent around

Chute, Kallfelz Exchange
Jobs During Check-up

 

 

Commencing today, Merlin M.
Chute, Bus. Ad. ’32, business man-
hager of the Pitt Panther, will be
the auditor of the Pitt Weekly, and
Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. ’33, busi-
ness manager of the Pitt Weekly,
will have the same job on the staff
of the humorous Dublication.

This exchange of business man-
agers for the purpose of auditing
each others books‘ and accounts is
in line with the. new policy of co-
operation between University pub-
lications. It is the belief of Chute
and Kallfelz that a mutual knowl-
edge of the business affairs of the
two publications will result in in-
creased efﬁciency and material
beneﬁts for both the Weekly and
Panther.

The new positions of auditors
which the publications chiefs have
established will not make the work
of the comptrollers any less neces-
sary. The auditor of a business
follows the comptroller, checking
his work.

  Scout Says:

 ‘ TAKING THINGS EASY
_ We didn’t know that there were that many people reading
, , this column until we stopped it . . . then they asked me why .. . .
 i _ and so I’m,back again . . . but we ’1l give the readers a vacation
 this week and make things as easy as possible _.  everything
  has been hunky-dory during the last two predictions . . . the
A "-Iowa one was perfect, $20-0 . . . and when we said 41-7 for the

West Virginia game, we meant 34 points . . . and the ﬁnal score

was 34-0 . . . so we’re all set for another week . . . but the old

“whys,” “wherefores,” “whereases,” “parties of the ﬁrst in-

= . <‘stanc_e,” parties of the second instance,” and “as it weres” are
’ leftiout-this week . . . if you really care, you can drop in the
ofﬁce-andelook at the exchange copy of the Reserve VVeekly and
 jfﬁnd out how we got that way, and incidentally, you can also
 discover our Christian name . , . but our thoughts are mainly on
i that Publications Formal tonight; and since we forgot to make

.3 carbon ‘copy of that story we sent down to Cleveland and we
2didn’t feel like retyping‘ the same thing, we’ll give you some-

. ‘thing different . . . the. score by the way for tomorrow ’s game is

’ . 68-0, ten touchdowns.

-: ~ . Among the things which we have noticed thus far
about the Pitt football team are: that line is composed
entirely of seniors . . . Clark is the only backﬁeld man
who will finish his allotted term of collegiate football
this season . . . Matesic, who played fullback for the

, freshman team last year, was shifted to the right half-
C,‘ back position because he is left-handed . . . when Reider
 is in the game, practically all the Pitt passes are thrown

by Heller . . . when Matesic or Sebastian is in there, they
throw the passes from left formation or from a double
pass, forward pass play starting from right formation
. . . the suspensions which the faculty meted out to C01-
lins, ‘MacMurdo and Daugherty have done some good

_ . . . . watch the pep these boys have . . . Hirsliberg is
' about the best forward pass receiver in these parts . . .
Joe Vitelli. who played fullback for the freshmen last
year. when Matesic wasn’t in the game, would be wel-
comed on the Pitt‘ squad right now . . . and Joe himself
wouldn’t mind playing . . . but he has to pay the pen-
-alty for quitting school to play professional baseball
' -last ‘spring . . . but then they say that this Weinstock
boy who comes from around N-anticoke where Eddie
Baker and “Muggsy” Skladany got their start is a real
wow“. . . and Johnny Luch will have to step some to
beat this boy out for the regular fullback post next

year. -
And speaking of the freshmen, Ken Ormiston, a Westing-
house graduate, is counted upon to make the fans forget Ray

. Montgomery, Jack Sack and Jock Sutherland as players . . . Ken

was an all-city high fullback for two years but was shifted to a

guard position down at Kiski . . . an.d he’s at the same place for

:the frosh, although you have to look in the score card to ﬁnd

that out once the game has- started . . . the main fault of the

Pitt football team to date has been its aptitude to do things

which draw the ire of the oﬁicials and result in the loss of yard-

age, through penalties . . . and then the team fumbles, too . . .

Pitt double-crossed West Virginia on those forward passes . . .

Heller threw ﬁve straight in Reider’s direction and just when

‘ the Mountaineer ’s secondary defense started to put an extra man

on the New Castle "ﬂash, Heller threw one to Hirshberg . . . Eddie

dodged one man but the last one nailed him . . . the people say a

lot of things about Heller . . . he wasn‘t a regular on his fresh-
man team but he made the varsity as a sophomore . . . the main
reason for the ﬁrst case was a bad leg.

And when we look at those big crowds at a football

-game, we wonder why they call it a college sport . . .

and all that care they take of the players and the at-
tention shown to the gentlemen of the press . . . and that
band . . . it seems that a band is as necessary for a foot-
ball game as a football itself . . . even the high school
kids must have one . . . but they shouldn't stand in the
middle of the ﬁeld for ﬁve minutes after the half is sup-
posed to have started and try to get organized enough

to play Alma Mater . . . after all, even though very few

people in the stands understand a great deal of the in-
tricacies connected with modern football, they came to

see the football game . . . and the band or any other

type of divertisement used between the halves should
realize this fact.

But before we close, we would like to mention a few things
other than those of a. sporting nature  . new styles in men ’s
hats are trying to make Eugenics out of the masculine sex, ...... ._
but not in the same degree that they have to the feminine co-
horts‘. . . Mary Linn has risen from obscurity into Universal
prominence mainly through a Weekly column . . . which may or
may not mean a thing to us dotters . . . but what do you think
of these: , .

Martin, Conti, Linten
Feature In Short
’ Workout

 

 

Boxing practice took a. large
step forward last night when the
ﬁrst ring practice was held at the
track house.

Both the light and the heavy e

weights went through a hard
three-round match, with Coach Or-
sini refereeing and with regula-
tion timi_ng being used.

Harry Conti and Hy Linten

looked good in the featherweight
division, showing both speed and
cleverness with their hands. Al-
though seemingly indifferent, Jer-
ry Glick showed decided ring skill
and should be a real help to 01'-
sini once he makes up his mind to
take the game seriously.
Martin Improves

Henry Martin showed still more
improvement and with the exhi-
bitions he has been giving to date
looks like a sure varsity man.
Martin has all that is necessary
for a. good boxer, including speed,
punch, and a willingness to learn.

More attention is being paid to
the freshmen this year than be-
fore, and more matches than last

year are promised them. Fresh-
man prospects are exceptionally
good this year, considering that
this is only the second year of the
sport, and Orsini is conﬁdent of

. turning out some good boxers. In

face of the strides made, last. year
with a small squad, Coach Orsini
should have a better season this
year, with a large squad and prop-
er training facilities on hand.

National Rating of Pitt
Premature--Sutherland

 

Members of the Pitt eleven were
ﬁred with enthusiasm and pep im-
mediately after last Saturday's
34-0 victory over West Virginia.
Although the tough struggle in the
ﬁrst half had tired the regulars,
they were delighted at the big
score and the laudatory write-ups
they were sure to get the next day
in the newspapers.

Jock Sutherland was plenty
happy at the victory since this was
the ﬁrst chance he had had to
avenge the triumph “Greasy”

, Neale, as coach of‘W. and J. had

achieved over Sutherland’s Lafay-
ette grid team in 1922. But the
big Scotch coach didn't forget his

’ customary pessimism, even in the

face of so sizeable a score.
Breaks Helpful

“The outcome might have been
different if the breaks had gone
the other way,” said Sutherland.
“O-ur offense was ragged and did
not nearly click as it should have.
The team needs plenty of work
if we are going to play Notre
Dame on even terms. You know,
the Pitt fans are taking too much
for granted in so calmly believing
that we have such a great team.
Wait till we meet Notre Dame.
Then we will be able to tell how
good we are.”,

Bobby Hogan, quarterback, was
pleased at the large score but said
that he thought that the eleven
needed a great deal of practice be-
fore it really rounded into its best
form.

Rocco Cutri, substitute quarter-
back, asid, “It was tough going in
the ﬁrst half, but we kept driving
away, and then it wasn’t so hard

who was one of the outstanding
stars of the game and who earned
great applause with some of the

this district in a long while, was
delighted at the victory. Johnny
comes from West Virginia and he
sure gave the folks back home
something to think about.

All the other players felt that
the game had shown that Pitt is
going to rank right up with the
leaders in national football. Some
were obviously displeased with the
result of the ﬁrst half, but they
soon shook off these feeling with
glances at the results of the sec-
ond half.

Student Exchange

Student football tickets
must be exchanged for the
Army game, according to an
announcement made this
week by Oliver Stiff, Stadium
business manager.

Tickets will be exchanged
at the ticket — cm, 6 State
Hall, on October 28, 29 and
30, from 9 o'clock to 4 o'clock.
The above mentioned dates
are positively the only ones
on which tickets will. «be ex-
changed. These tickets will
be good for the student sec-
tion, as before, but no ticket
will carry with it the privi-
legs of a reserved seat.

The exchange of tickets
is for the beneﬁt of the stu-
dent body in general. As
there are more student books
than seats allotted, the num-
ber of tickets exchanged will
give the Stadium authorities
a deﬁnite idea on the number ‘
of seats to be reserved for the
Pitt students.

Western Reserve’s football team
with a. tie in the Bowling Green
game, and a great defensive game
against a strong Purdue aggrega-
tion behlnd them,
Panthers this Saturday at Pitts-
burgh.

The Red and White squad this ‘

year is under the tutorship of a
trio of new coaches. Tom Keady,
former Quantico Marine mentor, is
the head coach. The assistants are
“Jiggs” Donahue and John Dres-
har. Keady has been coaching
teams for twenty years, having
displayed his wares at Dartmouth,
Lehigh, Vermont, and Donahue has
coached at St. John’s Prep, Wash-
ington and Lee, and Clemson,

while Dreshar was for two years a .

eleven.

Reserve’s team this year has 12. V

lettermen back and a host of good
sophomore material. The varsity-
boasts Captain Herb White at one
end, with Webster at the other.

Pat Troyan, who saw plenty of-

action last year, and Jerry Gentile
are the ﬁrst string substitutes.
The tackles are rather weak, al-
though there are five lettermen
capable of ﬁlling the post.
are Hurd, Davis, Slomovitz, Robin-
son, and Palmieri, who has been
shifted from fullback. The guards
are strong, with Childs, Cornsweet,
Soloway, and Christman looking
best. The center of the line is bol-
stered up by a scrappy former
high school star, Didonato.

Burgettstown Boys Star
Before Home Fans

 

The frosh team again crashed
through with a victory, beating the
Wash-Jeff freshman team, 18-0 at
Washington, Pa. The team has not
as yet been scored on and it hopes
to ﬁnish the season in the same
manner.

Nichsick was captain for the
day and he gave many of his~home-
towners quite a bit to talk about,
playing a bang-up game atone of
the backﬁeld positions. Both Nich-
sick and Kopolovich are from Bur-
gettétown and it seemed as if the
whole population of that town was
out to see the two boys who “made
good." Kopolovich justiﬁed the
fans’ enthusiasm by playing a
good defensive game.

Ruckert at End

One change in the line-up was
the shifting of Ruckert, who had
been playing at the quarterback
position, to end. He showed up
well at the terminal postland it is
thought that he will make a better
showing in this latter position
than he did in the backﬁeld. The
other ends showed marked im-
provement over the way they
played in the game against Wyo-
ming Seminary two weeks ago.

Commenting on the game, Coach
“Skip” Gougler said that the team
has improved greatly but some of
the members have much to learn
and many weak points to brush up.
The offensive pass didn't click so
well this week, but the boys did

succeed in breaking up W. and J.’s _

aerial attack. The opposing team
completed very few passes which
speaks well for the Pitt defense.
The next game is with the Car-
negie Tech freshman team in the
Tech Bowl at 10:30 o'clock tomor-
row. This is the ﬁrst chance that
Pitt students will have had to see
the team in action and quite a few
are expected to attend the game.

Frats Playoif
Court Match

Phi Gamma Delta Meets
Phi Kappa

Due to the acknowledgement of
the protest ﬁled by Phi Gamma
Delta on the forfeiture of its match
with Phi Kappa in the second
‘round of the interfraternity tennis
tournament, the winner of the
event is not yet known.

The match was awarded to the
latter team when the Phi Gams
failed to appear on scheduled time.
The latter, however, complained
that they had not been notiﬁed of
the match; and after deliberation,
the executive, committee upheld
their claim. ‘

In the meantime, the Phi Kaps
had been eliminated in the semi-
ﬁnal round by Phi Epsilon Pi,
which also captured its ﬁnal round
tilt with Sigma Alpha Epsilon with
Solow and Gurin winning single
matches over Young and Dewitt,
6-1, 6-2, and 6-2, 8-10, 6-2, respec-
tively. '

Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa
attempted to play off their second
round tilt Tuesday, but they were
unable to reach a decision when
darkness set in and when rain
softened the courts to such an ex-
tent that they were not available
for play Wednesday and yesterday.

Match Even.

Howard Kleeb, Phi Kappa, de-
feated Leroy Lewis, 7-5, 5-7, 8-6 in
one singles match; but the Phi
Gams evened the count when
George Geseman and Don Davis
teamed to defeat Kleeb and Tom
Gannon in the doubles match, 6-0,
6-4. Don Davis will play Tom Gan-
non in the remaining singles match,
and the fraternity whose represen-
tative wins this match will ad-
vance to the semi-ﬁnal round.

Should the Phi Kaps be victori-
ous, the tournament will end with
Phi Epsilon Pi declared the win-
ner; but if Phi Gamma Delta wins,
it will play Phi Epsilon Pi in the
semi-ﬁnals. A victory for the Phi
Eps will clinch the championship
for them; but again if the Phi
Gams win, they will play Sigma
Alpha Epsilon with the winner of
that match being declared cham-
pions.

Pitt Harriers
Meet Orange

Strong Syracuse Squad
Favored Over Locals

Coach Shea’s cross-country men
take on the strong Syracuse team
on the varsity course at Schenley
Park tomorrow at 11 o'clock. Syra-
cuse boasts one of the strongest

teams in the country. The varsity
has been strengthened by the ad-
dition of several members of last
year’s frosh team which won the
freshman I. C. A. A. A. A. cham-
pionship. Captain Belanger_ Street-
er, Dean, Isinnia and Bowman are
leading members of the team.

Coach Shea’s outlook on the
meet is rather pessimistic. Al-
though satisﬁed with the result
of last week's meet, he feels that
Pitt's only chance rests in making
a good showing rather than win-
ning.

Five Tie for First

Paced by Captain Glenn Thiele,
ﬁve of Shea’s harriers tied for ﬁrst
place while defeating Allegheny
College last Friday afternoon on
the 4%-mile course in Schenley
Park. Pitt made a perfect score,
15 to 40, winning by the greatest
margin in the history of the rival-
ry of the two schools.

The ﬁve men who tied for first
place making the time of 25:31
were Capt. Thiele, Smoyer, Maz-
zei, Clise, and Lawrence. Watkins,
McCormick, and Santicola fol-
lowed this group to the tape; but
since only the first ﬁve places
counted, they were not awarded
points. The Allegheny team fol-
lowed the last three Pitt men.

Allegheny College was repre-
sented by Captain Worral, Lubic,
Ish, Marx, Beiler, and Morgan.

Greeks Await Fourth
Horseshoe Tournament

 

 

The
tournament for 1931 will open Oc-
tober 20. For the fourth successive
time, the Pitt Weekly will present
a silver loving cup to the winner.

Each team will consist of two
men who may be changed at any
timeexcept during a game, pro-
viding the players are eligible ac-
cording to the intramural rules.
The method of determination will
be by elimination, the victor win-
ning two out of three games. Fail-
ure of a team to appear within ﬁf-
teen minutes of scheduled time
will constitute a forfeit.

Only students carrying twelve. or
more credits or their equivalent in
their University day school are
eligible. Engineering students on
registered ‘cooperative work are
permitted to compete. Students
who have not passed twelve credit
hours in their preceding semester
are ineligible.

Points shall be scored in the
following manner: The nearest
shoe shall count ‘one point, a
ringer counting for three. If both
shoes of one team are nearer the
peg than the nearest shoe of the
opponent, it shall count two points
for the former team. If two shoes
of opposite players, including
ringers, are equidistant from the
peg, they shall cancel each other
and the nearest of the remaining
shoes shall score the point. The
ﬁrst team to score 25 points wins
the game.

Tech Dramatics Head
Opens Y.lW.H.A. Forum

Mr. Elmer Kenyon, head of the
department of drama at Carnegie
Institute of Technology, will open
the monthly book forums at the Y.
M. & W. H. A. with a discussion of
J. B. Priestly’s “Angel Pavement,"
Sunday at 3:30 o'clock.

Mr. Kenyon, before assuming
his duties at Tech, was affiliated
with the Theater Guild. He is best
known to Pittsburghers as the for-

 

 

mer president of the Drama
League. _

The book selection, “Angel
Pavement,” was -selected for its

appeal to a large audience. Priest-
ly, the author, has been called “the
modern Dickens." It tells the story
of the experience of an adventurer

South Bend—Notre Dame faced an easy
opponent Saturday in Drake, but the var-
sity members of the squad will need the
rest, for they were battered around quite a
bit by the heavy Northwestern team and
their regulars must be in the best condition
possible for the game next week with the
Pitt team here.

From the showing made bygthe team in
its ﬁrst major tilt of the season last week
against Northwestern, Irish fans are conﬁ-
dent thst the name of Notre Dame will con-
tinue to be as well known in the realms of
intercollegiate football as it was during the
period of Rockne’s leadership.

Marchmount Schwartz served notice on
the sports writers of the country that he
is still one of the best backs in the country
even though “Marty” Brill, his blocking
back, has completed his allotted term of
intercollegiate competition. He punted and
passed well against the Wildcats and was
a continuous threat whenever he lugged
thei ball through the line or around right
en .

State College—-With the same old Penn
State spirit that has been shown at Phila-
delphia in previous contests, Coach Bob
Higgins’ eleven held Temple Universitfﬁ
heavy machine to a 12-0 sec at the Owl
stadium Saturday afternoon.

Holding the Owl eleven during the ﬁrst
half. except for an eigvh-€y—yard run by
Reese, Temple center, after he had inter-
cepted one of Bob Snyder’s forward passes,
the Lions exhibited, inside their own
twenty-yard line, a defense which thwarted
an Owl offensive on more than one occa-
sion.

Because of the heat the playing of both
teams was slowed up and substitutes en-
tered the game seemingly almost at will.
Penalties and fumbles were frequent and
interrupted any steady advance attempted
by either eleven, except for a march down
the ﬁeld at the start: of the second half.
This sixty-ﬁve-yard advance resulted in
Temple's second touchdown when Cornn!
Bonner crossed the goal line on a line buck
that started on the Lion ﬁve-yard stripe.

Carnegie Tech faced a letdown this week
with no game being scheduled, but the team
must prepare itself for a string of hard
games commencing next Saturday with
Purdue. Notre Dame, Pitt, Temple, and
New York U. to follow in the order named.

The Tartans showed greatly improved
form in their game with Georgia Tech over
the form which they displayed in their two
previous games with Buffalo and Wash-Jeff.
The cripples are rapidly returning to the
line-up and with George Kavel and Captain
Armentirout playing even better now than
they did last year, Tech fans are more
hopeful of successful ‘outcomes in the big
games to come.

West Point-—-The Army faced its first test
of the 1931 season Saturday and met it
with flying colors as the powerful invaders
from Michigan State fell before its serial
attack and iron defense. 20 to 7. The vis-
itors held the Cadets’ running game, but
when the time came to score, a brace of
well executed forward passes netted two
touchdowns and an intercepted toss paved
the way for the other.

Michigan State, coached by the once fa-
mous Jim Crowley, displayed all the ﬁne
coaching and -shaiftiness of the Rockne sys-
tem of football but it lacked reserve power;
and when the going got tough in the clos-
ing period the westerners were too ex-
hausted to sustain an attack that might
have pulled them up on even terms. On the
other hand. Major Sasse was always able
to replace his tired troops with fresh and
strong replacements.

King, Summerfelt, and Price were the
luminaries in the Army line, while Fields
and Elliott captured the limelight in the
backﬁeld, the former by his swift, accurate
passes. Monnett and Eliowitz stood out for
the invaders as did In husky named Buss
in the line. Michigan made seven ﬁrst
downs to Army's ﬁve and outgained the
home team in rushing.

Lincoln. Nebr.—~Nebraska came back af-
ter its defeat against Northwestern which
was caused mainly by the Cornhuskers' loss
of hope in the early minutes of the game,
and opened its “Big Six” schedule with a
13-0 victory over Oklahoma.

The Cornhuskers are idle tomorrow, but
next week they will swing into the last
part of their campaign. meeting the Other
members of the Conference along with
Iowa and Pitt.

A Pat Corr Enjoys Success
imming Coach

Pitt swimmers always associate
the words, “stop watch,” with
Coach Pat Corr. “Don’t loaf. Swim
your fastest all the time. The only
Way to develop your muscles and
improve your endurance is to pun-
ish those muscles,” repeats Corr
as he clocks the swimmers.

Corr likes to have the swimmers
work all the time and not loaf an
instant, whether they are swim-
ming the forty- or the hundred-
yard dash. Some swimmers have
a tendency to lag behind in the
longer sprints, and Corr makes
it his duty to speed up these slow
men. That is why Pitt swimmers,
after their training under Corr,
have found it possible to swim
long distances at full speed.

Pat has been Pitt swimming
coach since 1924, when he entered
the Law School. Corr was a great
swimmer in his own right, former-
ly holding several local records in
free-style events, ranging from
sprints to the mile. Coach Corr
works all the swimmers hard, but
tempers the severe practices with
occasional wise-cracks.

Coach Corr has developed a
number of champions and near-
champions during his coaching ca-
reer at Pitt. “Bus” Wright, “A1”
Mango, and “Pete” Bowen set
many University records, and car;-
ried Pitt through the undefeated
campaign of 1928, winning all-
American places for themselves.
Fred Wooldridge, captain in 1930
and 1931 and now assistant coach,
was one of Corr’s leading stars.

Coach Corr relates that in his
days as a swimmer at Pitt, four
swimmers and two plungers com-
prised a full team for inter-col-
legiate competition. Today, there
are over forty men out for the
varsity and freshman teams. This
year, Pitt's swimming team has
been entered in the Eastern Swim-
ming Association, comprislng. the
best teams in the East.

This looks like another success-
ful year for Coach Corr and his
swimmers. The varsity is well
fortiﬁed with several fast men
from last year’s speedy fresh out-
ﬁt, while the freshmen have Denny,
Davies, Warren, Stinner, Robbins,
and other former local high school
luminaries as candidates. Corr has
advised swimmers that he is point-

tends, “we have much better facili-
ties this year. The range upon
which we practiced last year could
scarcely be called that. The im-
proved range alone should give us
higher hopes.

“Last year,” he went on to say,
“we placed eighth in the National
Riﬂe Association regional shoots.
With the material on hand, we
cannot help but go some place this
year. Another thing, we are going
to beat Carnegie Tech this'yea.r!
Do you know, I believe that there
are about 200 men here who
would be good enough to create“
much keener competition, but who
think they would not have 3'
chance? There is always room for
good shots on the Pitt riﬂe team.”

Johns Hopkins University will
help Pitt lift the lid during the
Week of November 9.

, Staterlof Michigan has enact-

. teaching of civics in colleges

for voting should be adopted,
there would seem to be more of
a. necessity for compulsory
courses in civics. But even
here the though persists that
restrictive voting means gov-
ernment by the competent. And
the competent voter would be
sufficiently interested in his
government to voluntarily
study its makeup. Thus, why all
the agitation of compulsory
courses to make good govern-
ment?

Campus Thefts

IKE THE POOR, thieves

seem to be with “us al-
ways. It would probably be
disconcerting for some persons
to be told that petty thievery
exists in practically every large
American university. Students‘
who have been graduated from
high school are usually sup-
posed to possess enough de-
cency to respect the rights and
properties of others. 1 —

become serious if the Univer-
sity were not taking drastic

als to exercise their leanings
toward taking what is not their
own. lF'limsy locks are placed
on lockers; books and belong-
ings are left carelessly behind
in class rooms_ and the general
attitude of the strident is to
trust in the goodness Olf human
nature. However, in a school
the size of Pitt it is always
possible for the unscrupuloug
person to gain admission, and
for that reason students should
exercise caution in carrying
about valuables. _ » ‘

It may be that the thefts re-
ported‘ so far have been done
by persons entirely unconnect-

ed with the University, for it ‘

is possible for anyone to gain
access to campus buildings dur-
ing the day or evening. ._ ,

The moral of the fable is that
students must cooperate with
the administration in discour-
aging the persons responsible
for the thefts. The University
is bending every effort topro-
tect the student.

chance Bill stepped onto a. pile of
large rocks that lay poised at the
edge of the canyon. His 202 pound-s
were just what those tons of
rocks needed to send them plung-
ing into the chasm. But they
plunged without Bill Mendenhall,
for he jumped to the ice in the
nick of time. Again his compan-
ion above rescued him with his
clothes rope.

It was 9 o'clock at night when
the two barefoot men ﬁnally reach-
ed" the bottom of the glacier. Their
shoes and stockings had long. ago
been ripped to shreds by the sharp
ice, and now their feet were lacer-
ate-d and torn. Half frozen, half
unconscious, they couldn't possible
find their camp in the black Indian
night.

Then it was, like a beacon in a
storm-tossed sea, a call came out
of the nigt. “I-Ialloo! Halloo!”
With their last remaining strength,
the two men shouted a weak re-
ply. In a few moments a turbaned
native shepherd loomed’ out of the
dark. He had seen the men pass
in the morning, had not seen them
return. and suspected that some-
thing had gone amiss.

His first glance told this Saint
Bernard of the ‘Himalayas that Bill
was freezing to death. Without a
moment's hesitation, he pulled off

his only garment-——a. kind of blank-

For the first time in the history of athletics at
the University of Pittsburgh, the Pitt Band was
requested via the loudspeaker to leave the ﬁeld
at the half at the West Virginia game. It goes to
substantiate our theory that the game is some-
thing squeezed in between band music, cheers
and the Alma Mater.

The truth of the delay is this: Fifteen min-
utes are allotted to the two hands during the half.

minutes, leaving our boys a meager three min-

We are “swift as meditation or

the thoughts of love" to recom-
mend collections of letters. Let-
ters by anybody to anybody are
valuable enough to make us want
to read over the shoulders of peo-
ple on street care. And letters by
the illustrious are the best supple-
ments to the works of the illustri-
ous—-unless the illustrious happen
to be Leonardos, Durers or Hol-
beins with tendencies to do inter-
pretative portraits, of themselves.
The ﬁeld of letter-collecting has
been in a grand bloom for the last I
few weeks. Three volumes of let-
ters have come out intrepid suc-
cession:
Chopin's collected letters; the let-
ters of Giacomo Puccini are fresh
from“ Lippincott;
Sons have given us the correspond-
ence of two sprightly theatrical
souls in the letters of Ellen Terry
and George Bernard Shaw.

Knopf has published

and Putnam’s

Puccini's collection will prob-
ably sell the worst. More-’s the
pity; There's new material
here, well written and trans-
lated in an easy and sprightly
style. Whether or not you like
Pucc-ini’s la-la-Ia's, we're sure
you'll like the letters, merely
because they are exact por-
traits, and thorough and lucid
besides. Writing good letters
is a more complex problem
than most of us imagine. Pro-
jecting. your thoughts through
pen-made words to ’a friend or
a critic or a relative is much
like projecting light through a
prism. Light you get, to be

sure; but it's that many-
faceted, complex, lrridescent
sort——Very pretty, but hardly
the light that you started with.
Puccini is not« so many- a
faceted as most of the great.
There is a directness to his
ideas and his style that gives
his book a sturdiness, and the
good translation guarantees
against pedantic heaviness.
George Bernard Shaw and Ellen

Terry give us something quite dif- ‘

ferent. This is brilliant, intense
stuff. The movements of their
minds are the movements of two
incomparably skillful dancers,
each trying to outdo the other in
a tasteful, delicate show. The let-
ters are numerous, compact, de-
gghtful to read, piquant to remem-
er.

But, all in all, we like the
Chopin letters best.,They are
the ones that we want to buy,
to keep close at hand, perhaps
even to memorize through fre-
quent reading. They are the
master-letters of our group.
And we wonder at that-—-since,
after all, C. B. Shaw and Ellen
Terry worked In the trades of
words, and Chopin dealt with
notes alone. There is brilliance
here, but brilliance without
hardness or glitter. There is
an objectlveness and choice of
detail that make us know he
would have done well In Eng-
lish 25; and scarcely a para-
graph lacks its mood-color,
scarcely a word misses some
subtle effect of‘ music. Coi-
Iected, the letters fix a portrait
of Chopin as exact as any sort
of self-portrait can be——a pic-
ture of Chopin as he saw him-
self, unornamented, grave, at‘
times -almost naive. At their
most emotional points they
are refined with whimsy and
restraint. At their most even
level they are the calm talk of
somebody who is modest and

To the Editor Pitt Weekly:

Surely there are students in
the University who could sp-
preciate literary efforts of a.
more serious natiirethan those
now appearing in our humor-
ous magazine. The Pitt Panth-
er.

A literary magazine, or an
issue of the Panther devoted to
serious expression would satis-
fy the clamorous demands of
this faction as well as con-
vince the public that University
students do have serious’ mo-

ments.

half-a-child. We cannot read
them without remembering the
letters of John Keats. And
they might serve, like his, not

‘ only as a supplement for the

man’s work, but as an annota-
tion; qf the whole Romantic
Movement, as sort of comment
on the nineteenth century's
“Zeitgeist.

 
 

We want letters and still more

letters. No biography, no criticism.
no half-page notes in pin-point
type can show us the way as clear-
ly as these.
