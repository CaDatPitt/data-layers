If Pitt wants to improve its pub-
lic image, it can start by improving
its communication skills.

That's the consensus of local
and state officials who spoke at a
public forum last week entitled "Pitt
in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania:
Perils and Possibilities."

Although each panelist

addressed different aspects of Pitt's
relationship to Pittsburgh and the
state, all agreed that the University
needs to be more considerate of the
communities in which it resides.

For Pittsburgh City Council
member Dan Cohen, whose district
includes North Oakland, that means
talking to him before talking to the
media.

For example, Cohen said, ,_ he
didn't find out about the proposed

closing of Bigelow Boulevard until
he read about it in the newspaper.
"I was not briefed, I was not
lobbied, I wasn't even given a heads
up. Then when it came out in the
newspaper, I was assaulted by my
constituents with nothing to defend
myself," Cohen said. "It was so bad,
even my 3-year-old asked, ‘Daddy,
why are people so mad at you?"'
According to Cohen, the
Bigelow Boulevard "fiasco" is typi-

between Pitt and the surrounding

At this point, he said, things are
so bad that something as simple-as

them. A

Alleged punch brings
charges against referee

Brett Taylor
News Assistant

Pitt band member Sandra Wierzbicki
ﬁled criminal charges Thursday against the
ﬁeld judge whom she alleges punched her
in the face. She said the incident occurred
immediately after the band’s pregame per-
formance at last Saturday's home football
game against Notre Dame.

According to the Pitt Police report
ﬁled by Oﬁicer Annie Budzik, line judge
Tom Penault, of St. Paul,  was
charged with simple assault and harass-
ment after, he allegedly punched
Wierzbicki, leaving a bump on her fore-
head.

The report states he then turned
around and shoved the band member in the
arm and chest area with both hands while
attempting to escort three Notre Dame
captains through the band to get to the
ﬁeld. .

The band had just completed its
pregame performance andpwas marching

toward the sidelines. Perrault and the three
Notre Dame captains — quarterback Ron
Powlus, linebacker Melvin Dansby and
strong safety/kick retumer Allen Rossum
— attempted to make their way through
the crowd of band members to the center
. of the ﬁeld for the coin toss.

Rossum made his way through the
band, but Perrault, Powlus and Dansby
were cut off. According to the police
report, Perrault started pushing his way
through.

Budzik said in the report that another
Pitt Police olﬁcer had to get between one
of the Notre Dame captains and a Pitt band
member because itlooked as if they were
going to ﬁght.

According to the report, \V1e1zbicki
told police that Perrault threw his hands‘ up
‘in the air as he pushed through the band
members, and that she was struck in the
head with either his elbow or ﬁst. He then
allegedly turned around and shoved
VV1erzbicki and the another band member,

Officials say
new UPMC
name reflects
role in med
community

Hillary Stevenson
Staff Writer

In an attempt to more accurately
convey its role in Pittsburgh's med-
ical community, the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center is now
known as the UPMC Health System.
The change became effective
Oct. 1. ‘

"We believe the name more accu-

rately reflects the position of the hos-
pital in the community," said UPM-
CHS spokesperson Jane Duffield.
According to Duffield, some
community hospitals that the UPM-

CHS has acquired expressed concern
over the hospital's former name and
wanted an appellation that more cor-
rectly conveyed its role in the com-
munity.

Adding "health system" also
reﬂects the various programs that the
UPMCHS offers, Duffield noted. She
also said the UPMCHS wants to
make it obvious that it does more
than only partner with local hospitals.

In a letter to The Pitt News dated
Sept. 26, Duffield wrote that the
"new name better reflects the reality
of the integrated health care delivery
system the organization has devel-

oped throughout western
Pennsylvania.  [It is] more than a
network of hospitals."

The UPMCHS also offers insur-
ance products, rehabilitation ser-
vices, in-home services, retirement-
living options, and pharmacy ser-
vices.

Prior to being called the UPMC,
it was known as the University
Health Center.

Duffield added in her letter that
"the goal of the UPMC Health
System's expansion is to offer a full
range of hi_gh-quality, geographically

convenient health care services."

ASSAULT

Mandy Bray, in the chest.

"The referee and the two N otre Dame
players had no business cutting through the
band members to try and get through to the
ﬁeld," Wierzbicki said in the police report.

In a telephone conversation about the
incident, Perrault said he _was instructed by
Big 10 Conference officials to direct all
inquiries to them. However, nobody in the
Big 10 oﬁice was available for comment.

In the report, Perrault told police that
he said "Excuse me" as he worked his way’
through Pitt’s band. He explained that he
had his hands out in front of him but that
he never threw them up in the air and never
shoved anyone. He also told police he was
unaware anyone had been injured.

Wierzbicki, who reported feeling
dizzy from being struck, was escorted to a_
ﬁrst-aid station at Pitt Stadium by Budzik

and later taken to Presbyterian Hospital,
where she was treated and released.

She declined to talk about the incident.
A friend of Wierzbicki’s said that
Wierzbicki was instructed by the Pitt ath-
letics department not to talk to the media.

Ron Wahl, Pitt's assistant athletics
director, said he knew no more about the
situation than what was already reported.

"We have no information," Wahl said.
"We're referring everyone to the police.
They are handling the investigation."

Gilbert Marchman, the technical
adviser for the Big 10 Conference, which
provided Perrault as an oﬁicial for the
game, is investigating the incident for the
conference. Marchman was unable to be
reached as of Sunday afternoon.

The preliminary hearing is scheduled
for Dec. 12.

Across the Nation

BOSTON — O.J. Simpson legal analyst?

Simpson is again picking up the phone
to chat with TV anchors.

He dialed up Court TV»on Friday to
discuss a teenage au pair charged with mur-
dering a baby in her care in Massachusetts.

Simpson says he’s been tuning in to the

- trial coverage to watch attorney Barry
Scheck, a member of Sirnpson’s “Dream
Team” who is now defending au pair
Louise Woodward.

Simpson says he’s worried that some
people might be prejudiced against
Woodward because of Scheck’s aggressive
style. He says during his own murder trial,
he received letters complaining about what
he calls Scheck’s “Jewishness and his
style.”

AURORA, Colo. — A caring father, a
good friend, a humanitarian with a passion
forsongwriting.

His friends are saying all those things
about John Denver at a memorial service
today in Aurora, Colo.

One friend calls him “the folk poet of
our time.”

Hundreds of people lined up this mom-
ing for the memorial service. By the time it
started, there was a standing—room-only
crowd in Faith Presbyterian Church, which
seats 2,0()0. More than 100 people listened
to the service on loudspeakers outside.

Before the service began, Denver’s
songs played over the loudspeakers, and
many sang along. .

RALEIGH, N .C. -—— The referee who suf-
fered a heart attack on television during the
Virginia—North Carolina football game
recalls nothing from that weekend.

The 51-year-old James Knight was
technically dead on the ﬁeld at Kenan
Stadium. He had no pulse, and his heart
stopped four times before he got to a hospi-

tal that was less than a mile away.

Knight is now home after spending 10
days at the hospital. He’ll begin rehabilita-
tion soon and says he looks forward to offi-
ciating again. A

CHICAGO -—— Illinois has settled with a
Jewish nursing-home operator over accusa-
tions of anti-Sernitism.

The operator accused six public-health
inspectors of repeatedly making anti-
Sernitic remarks.

A The civil-rights lawsuit also accused
the inspectors of urging residents to demand
pork in their diet, even though they knew
the home maintains a Kosher kitchen.

A cook at the nursing home also quotes
inspectors as saying, “Those Jews, they’re
so cheap.”

The state has agreed to pay $250,000,
but it says it’s doing so only to end extensive
litigation and is not admitting the charges
are true. '

SALEM, Ore. — For the third time, a
female kicker may have a shot at playing in
a college—football game.

Louisville had a woman suit up in
1995, but she never got into a game. Duke
had a woman kick the winning ﬁeld goal in
the team’s 1995 spring scrimmage.

Now comes 20-year-old Liz Heaston, a
soccer player for Willamette University in
Oregon. She’s a junior who was asked to
join the team because the squad needs an
extra—point kicker.

PITTSBURGH — A murder suspect has
testiﬁed that the shooting of his neighbor’s
party guest was like an “out-of-body expe-
rience.” Dennis Norkiewicz said at his trial
Thursday in Allegheny County court he did-
n’t even hear the gunshots when he opened
ﬁre last year, killing Michael O’Connell and
wounding Robert O’Malley.

COMMUNICATION

with each other and admit that there
are strains, and they're very seri-
ous," he told the audience, which
included several of Pitt's top admin-
istrators.

For members of the state legis-
lature, communication means Pitt
doing a better job ofexplaining
what it is doing with state funds ‘and
how it is contributing to the welfare
of the state.

"We always joke that ‘state-
related' means Pitt gets all the
money, and they don't have to tell
us what they do with it," said state
representative Frank Dermody, D-
Oakmont. ,

State-related actually means
that Pitt is a private college with the
public purpose of providing educa-
tion to all Pennsylvania residents.

In return for receiving state
funds, Pitt agreed in 1966 to reduce
tuition rates for in-state students
and to allow the state to appoint
one—third of the seats on Pitt's
Board of Trustees.

However, Pitt's state-related
status does not require the
University to open up its books to
the state.

And when Pennsylvania asks it
to do so, state Senator Melissa Hart,
R-40th District, says the common-
wealth often encounters "academic
arrogance."

"They [University administra-
tors] seem to be saying, ‘We know
what we're doing, so don't you
worry about it,"' Hart said. "Well, if
they are not fully funded by private
sources, than they have to explain
what they are doing to those that
are paying the bills."

' In addition to showing the state
its books, Dermody wants Pitt to
make higher education more afford-
able for Pennsylvania residents.

"The idea of state-related is
access. The perception is that our
children should be able to get into
Pitt and should be able to afford it,"

THE PITT NEWS 3

FROM PAGE 1

Dermody said.

With rising tuition and increas-
ing competition for affordable
schools, "it is getting harder and
harder for in-state students to
attend Pitt, he said.

Dermody saidhe would like to

‘see an increase in state spending for

higher education if this would mean
a drop in tuition and greater acces-
sibility to Pitt's books.

For fiscal year 1998, Pitt's state
subsidy is $153.1 million of its
$855.1 million operating budget.

But not everyone agrees that
lack of communication is the
University's biggest problem.

Marshall Goodwin, chair of the
Oakland Community Council, said

Pitt needs to do more than just talk. .

"We have the communication,
but how do we get beyond commu-
nication to get action?" he asked.
"Our big problem is student hous-
ing. The University knows that, but
they don't do anything about it."

Goodwin was not a panelist at
the forum, but spoke up when the
audience was encouraged to
respond.

According to Goodwin, because
Pitt won't‘do anything about student
housing, Oakland residents hesitate
to support projects such as a new
convocation center.

"If we support all their plans,
then where's our leverage?

"It's unfortunate, though,
because we get labeled as anti-Pitt,
when really we would support a lot
of things Pitt wants to do, if only
they would listen to what we want,"
said Goodwin.

Thursday's forum was organized
by the University Senate.

Peter Garland, executive direc-
tor of the state board of education;
Clarke Thomas, senior editor of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and Linda
Dickerson, president and publisher
of Executive Report, also were pan-
elists. -

Nixon taught Americans how not to trust

Michael Berquist

p Pitt shouldn't keep its
5 udget secret from state

 Thirty-eight million in tax dollars for a convocation
‘~ ter. Twenty million for a science building. Twenty-ﬁve
‘on for renovations to the Cathedral. Twenty-four mil-
for general repairs.
It’s no wonder that community residents want to
, .w Pitt’s budget, want to know where the money is
I I ’ g. We want to know, too.

Pitt holds that dubious distinction of being called a
te-related” school. Not a state school. State-relatecl
/ Translation: a state school that doesn’t report to the
~ te.
 Now, that’s not quite the deﬁnition that others may
" "  e. You might hear that “state-related” means Pitt is “a
ate school with a public purpose — to educate all
sylvania residents,” or some rhetorical nonsense like

'9 ’ The fact is, Pitt gets a lot of money from the state —

J ut $150 million for 1998 — that Pitt doesn’t tell peo-
what it will be used for. There’s a so-called Fiscal Year
A’ '98 Proposed Budget that the Office of Budget,

‘ A. ' g and Analysis publishes, but it is very vague in its
~ scription. .
l‘ The problem is that, since Pitt likes to think of itself
: a public institution when it comes to soliciting money
t as a private institution whenever this suits it, the
’ 'stration feels no need to tell everybody where the

  

_ ause some of that money comes from alumni dona-
ns, or gifts, Pitt feels it has the right to be secretive.

' Well, coming from a private institution, where the
ney does come entirely from private sources, that atti-
’ " Ac - is acceptable. It’s not acceptable from Pitt.

- Taxpayers have a right to know what their money is
ing used for. The administration may feel it can brush
i tuition payers, reminding us that we’re getting a diplo-
T. at the end, and of course we disagree. Butthere is
, solutely no excuse that Pitt can make for not account-
g for public money.

If Pitt deems it totally unacceptable to release its
ole budget (though as far as we’re conoemed, it’s
 acceptable not to do so), then it should separate its bud-
t, have one for private resources and one for public
pi; ources, and release a detailed budget of where the tax-
.yers’ money goes.

  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  

 

columnist

When Richard Nixon passed
away three years ago, I was fascinat-
ed watching the media begin to grap-
ple with the legacy he had left. To
my amusement, the media chose to
sugarcoat their analysis of the Nixon
administration, mostly talking up
Nixon’s minor achievements in for-
eign policy, like detente with Russia
(how ironic that Nixon received
praise from conservatives for his for-
eign—policy accomplishments —
accomplishments that conservative
icon Ronald Reagan would overturn
when he became president). Now,
with some time having gone by
since his death, I think it is time to
take a good, hard look at what shall
likely end up being the real legacy of
Richard Nixon: Watergate.

Just over 25 years ago, a group
of petty burglars broke into the
Democratic Party headquarters at
the Watergate Hotel. Caught, their
actions were ultimately traced back
to the Committee to Re-Elect the
President (aptly nicknamed
“CREEP”), Richard Nixon’s 1972
reelection campaign. Nixon’s subse-
quent attempts to obstruct the inves-
tigation into the crime eventually led
to his downfall. It was one of the
landmark events in American histo-
ry, and it has since had a devastating
effect upon the level of trust people
have in our elected oﬂicials.

In 1964, 76 percent of the pub-
lic had faith in the goverrnnent to do
what was right most of, or all of, the
time. Last year, a new poll revealed
that just 26 percent of the public still
feel the same way. Public trust in
Congress, the presidency and the
media has declined at least 10 per-
cent or more in the last 25 years.

“Every president since Nixon
has been in the shadow of
Watergate,” said a professor at

American University on the 25th

anniversary of Watergate this past
summer. “I would argue it has had a

debilitating effect on our entire po1it- I

ical system.” Nixon’s crimes against
the Constitution led to an almost
complete collapse in the trust the
public had in government and forced
America into its gravest constitu-
tional crisis. That is Nixon’s real

legacy.
Today we are still feeling the
repercussions of the scandal.

Conservative pundits, lusting to
avenge Watergate, love to gripe that
Clinton’s legal problems are more
serious than Watergate (although it is
awfully confusing logic they use to
arrive at the conclusion that obstruc-
tion of justice, abuse of presidential
powers and contempt of Congress
are bigger crimes than whether or
not Bill and Hillary Clinton lost
money on a land deal during the
1980s).

One has to pity Wrlliarn Saﬁre,
a former speech writer for the Nixon
regime, who today devotes almost
every column he writes to grumbling
that America doesn’t share his
obsession with the Clinton scandals.
Former Nixon defenders like Saﬁre
think that if they cheated, then the
other people must have cheated, too.
The cycle of scandal and talk of
scandal today is never ending.

The media are an unwilling

to the GOP’s obsession with
the so-called “character” issue.

I was amused to see a cartoon
this summer that depicted a group of
diplomats posing for a photo-op
after signing a historic treaty
between NATO and Russia. One of
the diplomats mutters to another:

THE PITT NEWS

“Let’s face it, unless we all sleep
together nobody is going to care
about this.”

The media are so completely
obsessed with the sex lives of the
rich and famous that they are unable
and unwilling to report on drier fare
like peace treaties and economic
policies. “Television is essentially an
entertainment medium, and we’re
generally directed to the lowest com-
mon denominator,’? the American
University professor noted. I agree. I
have little conﬁdence in the media’s
ability to report on complicated and
complex subjects.

Today the real tragedy of
Watergate is that legitimate scandals
get mixed in with ﬁctitious ones and
the public carmot fully comprehend
what is serious news and what is
baloney. Conservative attempts to
attach the suﬂix “-gate” to every eth-
ical transgression of the Clinton
administration (however warranted
or not) have had the paradoxical
etfect of shielding Clinton by ensu-
ing that their complaints are clouded
by partisan rancor.

Idothinkthattherearesome
questions that need to be asked about
the Clinton adrninistration’s 1996
campaign fund—raising tactics, but
Republican attempts to portray
themselves as the irmocent party,

despite employing dubious tactics
themselves and outspending the
Democrats more than three to two in
the last election, are nothing short of
an outrage. It would be nice if there
could be a fair, independent investi-
gation of the 1996 fund—raising scan-
dals, but that isn’t likely to happen.

Michael Berquist hopes that people
will start to think critically about the

real legacy of the Nixon administra- -

tion - Watergate.

Midnight brings in the new Panther season, minus the fans

Kevin Lilley
Sports Editor

At 11:57 p.m. Friday night, when
everyone else on campus was busy doing,
well, something, I arrived outside the
Fitzgerald Field House to meet up with a
Pitt News photographer. _

It was dark. It was disturbing. Ifa ghost
town had quiet hours, it would still be loud-
er than it was Friday on top of Cardiac Hill.

I had received word from our news
editor/basketball wizard that the basketball
team was going to practice at midnight —
without the fanfare, without the crowds,
without anyone knowing about it. Except
us.

Oﬂicially, the practice was closed to
the media. According to my well—infonned
and well-connected source, Head Coach
Ralph Willard had made a‘ verbal agree-
ment with said source that our newspaper
was invited to any practice — open, closed,
cover-of-darkness, whatever.

“Door’s locked,” said the photograph-

er.

At 11:58, standing and freezing while
two security guards eyed us with confu-
sion, I got the distinct impression that
nobody was supposed to know about this.

. We waited. _

At 11:59, a car pulled up. A man
leaned out the window and motioned to
me. He had two bundled-up youngsters in
the back seat. I can only assume it was his
wife who was driving.

“Is this Midnight Madness?” he
asked?

“What?” I replied. The sudden activity
hadn’t quite registered yet.
“Are they having Midnight Madness?”

he asked, louder.

I frowned.

“Not this year,” I said. “Sony.”

His face froze.

“Oh, man.” he said, as he slid his head
back into the car and motioned for his wife
to keep driving. The children in the back
seat, obviously ﬁghting off sleep for the
past few hours, reclined amidst their coats
and blankets, ready to let visions of sug-
arplurns and Vonteego. Cummings dunks
dance in their heads. ’

I trudged back to the locked Field
House door, feeling like I’d just told
Panther Paul that his season tickets had
been revoked.

It was midnight. I was searching for a
way to sum up my emotional state to the
photographer.

“This sucks,” I said. That was about
the extent of my creativity for the evening.

A few minutes after midnight, we were
let in by an assistant coach. We were asked
to leave before we sat down. We did.

Out of respect for those whose job it is
to enforce the will of coaches when it
comes to media relations, I won’t even
report on the two minutes or so that I did
manage to catch. The photographer didn’t
take any pictures. - ‘

The party line on this one, folks, is that
the basketball team is going to get down to
business as soonas possible, starting with
the silent, team-only practice that took
place while other schools were holding

s1am—dunk contests and rock—music-backed
layup drills. Dedication will take center
stage, not ﬂashy play. Team unity will lead
the Panthers to the promised land.

That’s one theory on coaching and fan
relations, and for Wrllard’s sake, I hope it
works.

My only question is this: Why didn’t
the Panthers hold a Midnight Madness cel-
ebration Friday night, then hold their team-
only meeting Saturday afternoon, while the
campus sleeps, does homework or watches
college football?

The team gets its unity, but the fans get
their Sl’lO\‘.. Just because the team’s ﬁrst
oﬂicial practice would be a glitzy, radio-.
station-sponsored production wouldn’t
mean the players couldn’t have their
moment-of-silence practice the next day.

Willard said he reached this decision

_ after consulting with his players. Next time,

perhaps he should leave the marketing
decisions with Steve Pederson and athlet-
ics-department ofﬁcials instead of Kellii
Taylor.

In an’ interview this summer, Wllard
told me that the main reason Midnight
Madness was not held at Pitt last season
was that the date fell on a weeknight. He
didn’t want students or his student—athletes
to miss classes. He also infonned me that
this season, the madness night would fall
on a Friday, thanks to new NCAA rules
designed to make such a celebration easier
to organize.

I took such a statement to mean that
we’d be rocking Fitzgerald this past week-
end. Perhaps I misread his comments.

Instead of that traditional celebration,
the University put together Panther
Basketball Fanfest — an event that took
place before the Notre Dame game. Of
course, because it took place before oﬂicial
practices begin, the fans who attended were
treated to smiles and autographs instead of
rim—rocking, arena-shaking glimpses of
Panther excitement.

Players just stood around. In some
cases, they just sat around. While there is
merit to such a get-to-know-the-fans exer-
cise, I think it’s safe to assume that watch-
ing Attila Cosby sign his name is a bit less

I attention grabbing than watching Attila
Cosby nearly pull the rim off of the back- p

board with a 360-degree, between-the-legs
dunk over one of his teammates.

Just a guess.

No one wants to get down on a team
before it even plays a game, but let me end
with this:
Friday night to increase the Walt Harris-
induced school spirit on this campus with a
great basketball show.

It didn’t. It sacriﬁced the fans’ enjoy-
ment for one additional serious team prac-
tice. I

T‘hat’s ﬁne. But if the fans start leaving
games early and not showing up when the
team starts losing, complaining about the
lack of fan support would not be a wise

' IIIOVC.

If it wasn’t important now, it shouldn’t
be important then, right?

The act of chalking the side-

was a far worse crime than writing
in chalk on University property. If
racist, sexist or anti-Semitic ﬂyers
had been put up, surely the public
outcry would have been reflected in
the pages of The Pitt News.

The chalked messages clearly
improved gay awareness. Everyone
that walked by thought about gays
when they otherwise would not
have. Given that it was National

chalkers were focused on reaching
those people still in the closet, not
on promoting civil rights.
According to the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, les-
bian and" gay teens are two to six
times more likely to attempt suicide
than other teens and account for up
to 30 percent of all teen suicides. It
is estimated that a teen in the
United States takes his or her own
life every five hours because he or
she is bisexual, transgender, lesbian
or gay. If the chalked messages
helped one person feel better about
herself, the messages were a suc-
cess. It is much easier to wash away
chalk on a sidewalk than it is to
erase the pain felt by a gay person
in a homophobic society.

Global warming
is still a theory,
not scientific fact

This letter is in response to
Christopher Tracey’s letter asserting that
global warming is science fact. This is
not true. There is no evidence proving
that there is a human inﬂuence on cli-
mate change. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change is hardly a
credible organization to quote for this
purpose. The IPCC is a group with an
agenda. They pick and choose which
parts of studies to use and which to dis-
card. They will use the parts that uphold
their beliefs in global warming and dis-
card those that do not. In fact, they have
blatantly disregarded parts of reports that

state that there is no conclusive proof of
the human inﬂuence on climate change.
The scientiﬁc community is hardly in
total agreement when it comes to global
warming, even though it is made to seem
so.

The fact is even if carbon dioxide is
a proven greenhouse gas, we don’t know
where it is all going when it is released.
(Yes, it does go other places besides the
atmosphere. The ocean holds quite a bit
of it.) Also, the models being used to pre-
dict climate change make some gross
assumptions in order to model the earth’s
climate and to make a prediction. The
earth’s climate is a chaotic condition that
does not lend itself to mathematical
modeling. Major simpliﬁcations must be
made to make this problem feasible. This
introduces a great deal of error. As these
models are improved, they show smaller
and smaller increases in temperature in
the future. The earth’s climate changes
naturally and has done so throughout its
history. This is why we have had ice
ages. There is no conclusive proof to
show that the changes in climate that we
may be seeing, as small as they are, are
the result of man and not nature.

the national title  

“WE ARE PENN STATE!”

That’s- the standard chant, but
Saturday’s game had Lion fans mur-
muring two new chants:

“WE ARE LUCKY TO BEAT
THE GOPHERS!

“WE ARE NOT NUMBER
ONE!”

PSU narrowly beat a— Minnesota
team that had lost four and now five
games in a‘ row. The Nittany'Lions
were down 15-3 with just over 14
minutes to play in the game. _

But give the Penn Staters some
kudos; at least they won. And they
could have tallied another touchdown
at the end of the game, but in typical
Joe Paterno fashion, they downed the
ball to end the game.

JoePa said, “It was a win. You
shouldn’t apologize for it.”

Maybe he should have. Because
of the near loss, his squad is no longer
the top-ranked team in the nation. In
the Associated Press poll, Nebraska,
fresh from a 29-0 rout of Texas Tech,
took home 33 first-place votes to
Penn State’s 26. Patemo’s peers still
gave ‘him some respect in the
ESPN/USA Today coaches’ poll. The
Lions picked up one more first-place
vote, but were still 14 overall votes
behind the Huskers.

So what does this mean for Penn
State?

It could be deja vu all over again.

Remember 1994, when the Lions
went undefeated but lost the national
championship to an undefeated
Nebraska team? That year, Penn State
embarrassed Ohio State and Michigan
with case. It was p an offensive
machine with an underrated defense.

Penn State’s problem was its
alliance with the Rose Bowl, which
sent its weak-as-usual championship
team in the form of the Oregon
Mighty Ducks. PSU routed them, but
Nebraska beat Miami in the Orange
Bowl. The voters may have not
picked the best team, but because of
the storied (more like a bad romance
novel) tradition of the Rose Bowl, the
two teams"couldn’t play what might
have been the game of the decade.

The same scenario could occur
again, and Nebraska could be the cul-
prit. Nebraska will play out its Big 12
schedule undefeated and then beat

National power St. John’s pounds Panthers

Jeff Cumpson

For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh men’s'

soccer team hoped to go undefeated in its
two matches this week, as defending
National Champion St. John’s came to
Pitt Stadium.

Earlier in the week, Pitt traveled to
Buffalo to take on the Golden Grifﬁths of
Canisius College and came away with a
4-0 victory. Matt Gray, Jeff Dyer,

Spencer Barton, and Reagan Bender all
scored, and Chris Hanlon and Jared
Cochran combined to make eight saves
for the Panther shutout. A win against St.
John’s Saturday would solidify Pitt’s
position in the Big East Conference and
improve its current rank of 18th in the
national polls.

But instead, the Red Storm, defend-
ing NCAA soccer champs, took the
Panthers down 2-1 and may have cost
them their spot in the top 25.

St. John’s played well early, string-

ing passes together and keeping the ball A

in Pitt’s end of the ﬁeld for the majority

of the first half. Its efforts came to’

fruition at 5:50 into the match, when

one of the Florida teams in the
Orange Bowl. Penn State should fin-
ish off the rest of its Big 10 oppo-
nents, but even that is a stretch. The
Lions still have Michigan (with its
tremendous defense). at home, and
road games at Purdue and Michigan

FROM PAGE 8

_ State.

So if Penn State goes undefeated,
it’ll play in Pasadena. It can hope for
Washington to win the rest of its
games to give it a quality match-up
that the voters will like. But if the
Huskies falter and fall out of the Top

10, then for the second time in four -

years, Penn State will go undefeated
and get stiffed. I

And I will laugh out loud because
my prediction a month or so ago will

come true. I hate to criticize a fellow
carrot top, but Mike McQueary isn’t
the proper caliber of quarterback to
pilot any team to a national champi-
onship. He nearly crashed against
Minnesota with a 7-for-18 perfor-
mancefor just 85 yards and two inter-

ceptions, but an emergency landing in ,

the form of a Minnesota fumble on its
own 10-yard line gave Penn State a
chance at redemption.

McQueary played well in the win
over Ohio State, but let’s see how he
fares against Michigan and Purdue in

back-to-back weeks. The whole Rose -
- Bowl scenario shouldn’t even be con-

templated, because Penn State is
going to lose to either Michigan,
Purdue or Michigan State.

And losses to all three would be
just peachy.

cation,” said Pitt Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher. “It looked like Chris Hanlon
was going to try to clear the ball.”

The rest of the first half consisted of
St. John’s testing Hanlon from close
range, and the Pitt keeper coming up big.
The ball was in the Panther box repeated-
ly, and Hanlon’s sometimes-diving saves
kept the gamecloser than it should have
been. Pitt made up for a decided speed
and skill differential with scrappy play
that could have resulted in at least one
goal, but balls through the St. John’s box

' bounced away without a Panther getting

a clear shot on any of them. Although
Pittsburgh didn’t have any shots on goal
in the first half, the deﬁcit still stood at
only one goal. _ -

St. John’s opened the second half

with a comer kick (and another big save
by Hanlon), but the Red Storm players,
seemingly satisﬁed with a one-goal lead,
began a series of mental lapses that cul-
minated in Pitt’s first real chance. Pitt
midfielder Billy Hicks stole the ball from
a defender in the St. John’s half of the
ﬁeld and fired a rocket from almost 18
yards out.

Goalkeeper‘ Dani Braga made a
tough save that seemed to wake up the
Red Storm,‘ and it extended its lead rriin-
utes later with Andrew Henry’s goal. It
came at 57:30 into the match and was
assisted by Brent Santo. Henry took
Santo’s pass and bounced it past a shield-
ed Hanlon as St. John’s went up 2-0.

Pitt answered quickly when Drew
Kopp set up Phil Mati1la’s eighth goal of
the season at 62:11. Matilla, the tearn’s
leading scorer, took Kopp’s pass and
fired it home from six yards out to get

Monday, 20 October 1997

Pittsburgh back in the game.

The goal also resulted in the match’s
most physical play, as Matilla suffered a
bloody nose in the ensuing celebration
and was forced to leave the game until
late in the half. Though Pitt registered

three more shots in the half, its best

chance to tie the game came with about

’ 10 minutes left to play, when the Panthers

were awarded an indirect kick after a foul
was called against St. John’s. In what per-
haps typiﬁed the afternoon for Pitt, an
excellent scoring opportunity did not
even result in a shot, as the ball was
tapped around one too many times before
the Red Storm got control and cleared it.

“We squandered some chances  but
our guys played har ,” said Coach
Luxbacher.

Pitt’s next match, the start of a three-
game road trip, is- Oct. 24 versus th
Connecticut Huskies. -

nom goalkeeper Nicole Bashor came
through for her team by making save after
save.

Still, the Nittany Lion attacks were
quickly wearing down the Panther
defense. PSU junior forward Carole
Dutchka ﬁnally tied the game after she

_ collected a rebound off the left post.

Dutchka’s goal came with under 20 min-
utes left in the second frame.

The Lady Lions quickly took the lead
as they converted another rebound off the
crossbar. Senior forward Rachel
Hoffman, scored on an open right side of

the netas Bashor was left helpless after \

diving to save the ﬁrst attempt.

PSU never gave the Panthers an
opportunity to get back into the game. It
controlled the ball and spent the majority
of the half inside the Panther zone. Bashor

at times made clutch saves that kept her
team in the game, but Pitt couldn’t get its
offense going and was limited to few
chances. Pitt was outshot in the second
half 11-3, and 18-8 overall.

“Overall our defense played well, but
our attack is struggling a little. We still
have a young team. We need ‘a dominat-
-ing midﬁelder or forward tocomplement
Beasley,” said Coach Sturk.

Sturk also commented on the
Panthers’ lost opportunity after they had
led Penn State. .

“It was hard to accept the comeback.
Penn State had just come off a conference
loss to Minnesota. We had them in a tough
position.” ‘ .

He added that the team has improved
over the «season so far, saying that “with
Friday night’s win and today’s game, we
are starting to gel together as a team.”

After the game, Coach Sturk encour-
aged his team to keep playing hard, say-

ing the players aie finally learning each
other’s play and that they are gaining
valuable experience.

With the loss, Pitt’s record fell to 2-9-

3 overall, and 1-6-1 in the Big East. PSU 1

improved to 11-4-1, and 6-2-1 in Big Ten
play. »
In Friday’s game, the Panther defense
came through, shutting down the opposi-
tion by liniiting Buffalo’s chances and
controlling the ball in and out of its own
end. Bashor made 11 saves in the contest.

Pitt and Buffalo kept each other off
the scoreboard in regulation play. But
Pitt’s Beasley sent the Buffalo players
home with their heads hanging by scoring
the game-winning goal only eight min-
utes into the overtime frame. Beasley’s
goal was the result of a penalty kick. '

The Lady Panthers resume play
Friday, Oct. 24, when they face Big East
Conference foe Connecticut at Pitt
Stadium.
