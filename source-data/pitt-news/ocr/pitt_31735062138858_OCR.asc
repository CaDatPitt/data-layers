stolen. Entrance was made through
a back window, with the aid of a _glass
ictpljtter. The show case was I ken
andyabout $30 worth of candy taken.

torn from the walls and thrown on
the ﬂoor, and 19 table covers‘ and s-ix
dozen pieces of silver are reported
missing also. It is thought that the
robbery was done more for spite Work

"and contempt, than for loot, as‘ many

valuable ‘things were overlooked. No
trace of the vandals has been discov-
ered, but Captain Emmett and Assist-
ant Superintendent Kennelley of the
Pittsburgh police, arerworking on the
case. ‘

A SONG BIRf)S PR°ACTICE

The girls of the School of Educa-
tion have‘ formed a chorus and are
having weekly practices. Not to be
outdone, the boys have been trying
to form a double quartet. As there
are hardly enough boys in the school
for this, they will probably be helped
out by some of the faculty. They
claim they canget up ‘ta better quartet
than the girls. Anyhow the School
of Education will have goodsinging

after they get started. '

THE RIGHT IDEA‘ ~

The action taken by the.Cap and '
;_Gown Club. of the University at‘

—a rneetging a few nights ago, when
to .put out their
'»progr_am fore the annual perform-
ance of "the _club without hav-
.ing any advertising in it, in order
that the ,Pitt Weekly and ‘the. Junior
Owl would be able-to secureimore
, L It _is
agreed that the Pitt Weekly and the

_.Owl shouldﬁbe given all the encour-

, izations.

To put rfut the program for the per-
formance of the club without any ads
meant a sacriﬁce’ on the part ofthe
club of no small siie. The amount of
money that would have come to the
organization through the channel of
advertising would have been several
hundred dollars. But all this was
waived aside by the members, and it,
was unanimously agreed to do'no' ad-
vertising at all, for the benefit of other
o_rganizations in the University.

All honor is due to the Cap and
Gown Club- as pioneers in the effort
to abolish all program advertising by
any organization connectedwith Pitt.
Thatsuch action ought to-be taken
has long been evident to many in the
Univer.sity;i but it was up” to the Thes-
pians to make the initial move for bet-
ter things. We hope that the good
vvorkimay bear much fruit.

. FOOTBALL BANQUET

Plans are being made for the annual
student banquet in honor of the foot-
ball ‘team, to be given on the evening
of Saturday, December 7, at ‘the ‘Hotel
Schenley. Many of .the prominent
alumni of the University will be pres-
ent and will make speeches, toget'her
with members of the‘ faculty and the
-football squad. Altogether the pro-
gram‘ that is being arranged assures
every one that attends the banquet .a'
great evening. ,‘

-» There is no better way to show
your appreciation of ,the’team that
represents the University on the grid-
iron than to be out at this banquet
that_ is given in their honor. Every
man that has the interest of the team
at heart and has, ithetrue‘ spirit ‘of
Pitt will make it a pbint to be at‘-this
gathering. Not only will this: event
furnish an opportunity to do honor to
the men that have worked hard all
season on the football ﬁeld, but it will
afford every stu_dent,a_chance topcome
in contact and to become better ac-
quainted with the ‘members of the
team as well as many of the men that
have helped to make the University

what it is to-day. . . '

"The price’ of the banquet is within
the reach of every student. One dol-_
lar and a quarter is a small sum to
pay for all the good that is to be
gain.ed by attendﬁig the banquet. Let
every man turnout to this affair and
make it one .of the most successful
events that -has ever taken place at
the University. ‘

CAP AND GOWN P_As'sEs _
IMPoRTANT RESOLUTION

 

(Continued from‘ Page 1)
It was decided that some organ-
ization would have to set a precedent
in the matter of programads and the

'Cap .and Gown members thought that

it would be well for them to take the
matter up. .

H. B. Meller, faculty advisor of the
organization, when interviewed by a
Pitt Weekly reporter, had this to say
as to the outlook for the season:

“We expect to have the best season
in. the history of the club. The play
is one of the best that I have ever

read, while the music is all" new and

catchy. The number of men that
turned out at the first meeting was
encouraging. We will need about
ﬁfty men in the play. The more that
turn out to compete the stronger the
cast will be. We expect to make a
trip of a week during the Spring re-
cess. The club will travel in its own
private car and will have every com-
for-t that money can get. I do not

’ speak in a spirit of egotism when‘I

say that Ithink that too much credit
cannot be given the Cap and Gown
Club for starting the movement for
the abolition of program advertising.
We are the pioneers in this matter,
and I feel sure that other organiza-

P’ tions will be forced to do away with

this form of advertising. It is not a
fair method and I am certain that its
death knell has been sounded by the
recent action of our club.” .

Last Thursday Dr. Crafer’s class in

School for the Blind. Through the
courtesy of Superintendent‘ McAloney
and, his efficient staff, the visiting stu-
dents. were shown all the details of
the work accomplished. The real sig-
niﬁcance of the work consists in re-
storing one of the most helpless‘ ‘class
of defectives to a condition. of self-
suppor-t. -Dr. Crater and the class
wish, ‘through the columns of the
Weekly, to express their gr,'atitude'to
the superintendent and his staff for
their courtesy in explaining the work
of the institution. I D

andisurrounding cities to see the game
with a “him” who was sure to buy
ﬂowers ‘and candy and explain “just
how the tearii had done it” between
cheers. The cheering was splendid all
during the game, but the mighty vol-
ume of sound that rose from the Yale

stands when Pumpelly tied the score"

for the Blue in the last few minutes

-, of play overshadowed any other that

was given whilethe contest was being

played. A great number of the spec-‘

tators toured to the game -in autos
-and the quiet old village of Princeton
resembled a. metropolis under the
noise, grind and smoke oftrafﬁc. The
cries of the ﬂower and pennant vend-
ers andithe excitement on all ﬁdes

_ ‘ lent a delightful tang to the atmos-

phere before the great game "started.

Either team would undoubtedly de-
feat Pitt this year as our team is un-
usually weak, but we believe that the
l9l0~eleven would have given them a
hard game with equal Chances of vic-
tory. Neither Yale nor Princeton

‘showed a varied attack and the only

forward pass attempted was when
Yale saw her chances were very‘slim
and decided to take a chance on the
open game. Both showed a particu-
larly strong defense, but neither was
able to gain consistently when in pos-
session of the ball and towards the

. end of the game resorted to punting

on the .ﬁrst' down hoping to recover
a fumble and keep the ball in the ter-
ritory.of the opposing team. The cen-
ter of Pitt’s line would easily have
held their own with their lighter op-
ponents, but the Yale and Princeton
ends and tackles were stronger than

‘ the ‘varsity men at Pitt. r
i -‘:The crowd at the Pitt games at

Forbes Field seem evenimore inter-
ested in the game than the crowd at
the -Easternxgames. At our games the

: people ‘are on their feet with almost

every play, while the people at the big
games in the East remain seated most

 'v_of the time and leave the cheering en-
 ‘tirely to the rooters of the opposing
.. colleges. ‘ "1

- Pitt may well b_e proud of her spirit
and cheering as our yells are more

life as those of either Yale or Prince-

‘better. Even the size of the crowds

"at the Pitt games compares favorably

with that .c;f the Eastern games; our

‘attendance’ at the W. & 1. game was

over 12,000 and fully 20,000 will see
the State game from present indica-
tions. ii . . "

prescribed for the remainder of the
week by Head Coach Joe Thompson,
and, while it is a strenuous proceed-
ing for this time of year, it is Pitt’s
chief hope ‘of stren-gthening the team
for the coming struggle.

Ex-Capt. “Tex” Richards sent word

expected to be on hand the early part
of~next week to assist in coaching the
backﬁeld men and’ his help. will be a
great beneﬁt to the men who will play
against State on Thursday. “Texj”
captained the 1910 championship
eleven and under his leadiershipiPitt
had a g"i‘eat record 5of'282-0 for the
season. Georgetown, State and VV. 81
I.“ fell before Pitt that‘ year each ‘by
two ‘toughdowns or, more and the
Gold andiltlue team was conceded to
be one of tlieeihiest elevens in the coun-
try by many«_ ‘-‘wise ones” who saw
them perform. _ARichards was ‘one of
the most popular r‘ne‘n"in his class and
is probably the greatest football play-
er ev.e_r turned out by Pitt. “Tex”
was an all round istar, being equally
good at the open game and at straight
football. He was a “be.ar”'at bucking
the line and could be relied upon to
take out the opposing end on an end
run; besides this, he got splendid dis;
tance and height on his punts and
tackled viciously on the defense.
“Tex” was an expert at tossing the
forwafd pass and had opposing teams
guessing at all stages of the game.
Several feats pulled off by this star
will long be remembered by Pitt men;
in the Georgetown game in 1910, Pitt
had the ban on the visitors’ 10-yard
line and decided to try a forward pass
to score. Fury, the Georgetown
quarter, and a‘ sprinter of some note,
intercepted the pass and set sail for
Pitt’s goal with at least 5 yards lead
on the Pitt captain. “Tex” took up
the chase and on Pitt’s 20-yard mark
tackled Fury with such force that he
fumbled the ball which Richards re-

by two others that “Tex” made in
later games against West Virginia.and
State. Pitt had not been scored on
during the season and every man in
the lineup was ﬁghting hard to keep
the Gold and Blue slate clean. The
VVest Virginia fullback recovered a
fluke punt and started for Pitt’-s Cov-
eted line with four men forming a
‘solid line of interference before him,
they passed the enﬁre team and in
some miraculous manner, with the in-
terference still intact, but they still

 IN UNITED STATES

A report issued by the United States
Bureau of Education shows an‘enroll-
ment of 4,856 foreigners as regular
students in the collegesiand universi-
ties of the United States and of 371
more as summer «students, bringin_g
the total up to 5,227. In this foreign
represéntatipn Canada leads with 898

Britain robs Oxford. and Cambridge

supremac in university and college

313. In addition to the contingent
from China and Japan, the Asiatic rep-

resentation includes 148 from India
and Ceylon, 21 from Korea, 17 from
Persia, 73 from Turkey in Asia and
24 from other Asiatic countries. The
Philippines, as might be expected, are

, strongly represented, the number from

that quarter being 123, while Hawaii

The presence of these foreigners in

be‘, attributedto the conviction that

"the educational facilitiesiobtainable in_

the -strongest that ever represented
the Blue andiWhite. More than half
the squad played against Pitt in 1910
while all but two held down regular
positions. last year when Pitt was de-
feated in an unlucky battle 3-0. State
has shown great strength this year as
she won from W. & J. 30-O; Penn,
14-0, and Ohio State, champions of
Ohio, 35-0 inha rough game in which
the Buckeye team quit the ﬁeld on ac—_

arrive with the greatest of confidence,

stronger team than W; & J. defeated
