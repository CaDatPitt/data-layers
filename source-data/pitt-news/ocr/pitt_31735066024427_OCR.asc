“Students become disinterested”
or “many issues discussed don't per,-
tainto them directly”are some ofthe
responses to inquiries about the lack
of student participation on some of
the l3‘Senate Standing Committees.

To evaluate the student pa rticipa—
tion during the past year on the
Senate Standing Committees is dif-
ficult because several of the 23
undergraduate students on the
standing comlnittees graduated in
April or returned home for the
summer without leaving a forward-
ing address with the University
Senate Office or the Student
Government Office. .

Each Senate Standing Committee
has a membership consisting of nine
faculty, four students (2 undergrad-
uate students. I General Studies stu-
dent, and l graduate student), and
an administrative liason. Each com-
mittee is concerned with a specific
area of the university.

Areas of concern include: student

affairs. admissions and student aid. \

athletics, budget and educational
policies. commonwealth relations.
health and welfare, computer usage,
organization and planning, librar-
ies, tenure and academic planning
and the University Press. ‘
After study and discussion, each
standing committee sends written
recommendations to
Council for discussion and possible
approval. Since May, recommenda-
tions pertaining directly to students
that have been approved by Senate
Council include a mandatory class
attendance rule for first-year and
academically troubled athletes,

which was proposed by the Senate
Standing Committee on Athletics.

Also, the Educational Policies
Committee sent a report to the
Senate Council in May on a foreign
language requirement. Although the
committee could not justify a
university—wide requirement in all
schools, it recommends “that more
effort should be made to make for-
eign languages accessible and availa-
ble,” by promoting a climate which
“values and encourages the study of
a second language."

Below is a list ofSenate Standing
Committees whose goals will require
much student input within the next
year.

Admissions and Student
Aid

The Senate Committee on Admis-
sions and Student Aid deals with
admissions, scholarships, and fund-
ing' of studerit aid projects. its over-
all goal is to “establish a clear-cut'iset
of admissions criteria for CAS and
to -develop a university—wide system
to correlate admissions criteria and
success in college." ‘

- Athletics

ln continuing its effort to improve

the academic program of student-.

athletes, the Senate Athletic Com-
mittee works with various academic
and administrative offices. The
range oftopics it covers include phi-
losophy of intercollegiate athletics
at Pitt, admissions, probation, dis-

.missal and eligibility criteria.

Commonwealth Relations‘

mo,nweal'th.Relations works directly
with members of the state’s General
Assembly to bring more appropria-

Patricia. _

She also said she is treated as a
professional by administrators at
the agency. While her supervisor
was away on vacation, Patricia was
responsible for her superiorjs work,
includingidecision making. «

And The P

  New Distric

The story of King Solomon is familiar: as proof of his .
wisdom, the legend claims that ‘two women came to him,
both claiming to be the real mother of the same child.
Solomon suggests that the child be divided in half—a sug-
gestion that sounds reasonable to one ofthe women. But the
other woman _relents: “It is better that the child lives.”
Solomon recognizes this woman to be the true mother, thus H
strengthening his reputation.

The situation isn’t much different in the Eastern school
district ‘merger; it is still a question of the fate of children. Yet
few of the principles involved in the case demonstrate the
sage of Solomon.

The newspapers continue to "report that Judge Gerald
Weber is “growing impatient“ with the New District’s board
and their failure to put together an equitable plan for deseg-

' regation. The fact that hisrecent ruling upsets the super-
structure of ﬁve school districts seems secondary to the spirit
of his court order. This kind of reasoning is at least impracti-
cal, and perhaps extremist—qualities that are becoming
popular around the Eastern suburb these days.

\ ‘ One reason that the General Braddock parents fought for
ten years to redistrict was because of the deteriorating condi- J
tion of their buildings. Now that the New District has
decided that General Braddock will be'bused and not‘
Churchill, the parents of Braddock are up in arms:lWhy
can't Churchill students be bused into Braddock?)Appar,-
ently the Braddock school buildings aren't deteriorating fast

, V enough to_ warrant one-way busing. :

The members of the Churchill Save Our Schools move-
ment have a rallying cry: “If our case is not heard, then there
is no justice in this country." This cry comes after Judge
Weber's de'cision, and after the Federal court decision, and
after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Three courts
had their chance to review the case, and all three agreed on
the merits or legality of the decision. It seems that the
Churchill S.O;S. believes that justice begins notin testimony
and debate but when someone agrees. ' _

Perhaps that is the most damaging element of this entire
case: all the principles have engaged in either meaningless ‘
rhetoric or impractical extremism-and the‘ welfare of the
children becomes subordinate. ls Judge Weber beiieliting
the children by trying to make hisunfathomable’plan work? ' -

. Are the General Braddock parentsqhelping their kidswby

The Year’s Most Boring Event,

By MARY KANE
AND
MARK COLLINS

Royal Writers

We wish to quell the criticism con-

cerning the royal wedding. Those of
us who were up at 5 a.m. to watch
this. momentous event realize the
importance of this day. At the same
time, we wish tovapplaud the exten-
sive converage given by the local
media in particular._The Pittsburgh
Press and The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette featured a photo of Eng-
land’s dreamiest couple_'hand—in-
hand ﬂoating down a ﬂight of royal
steps-. We commend their thought-
fulness and foresight in providing a
wonderful royal full-fa’c'e shot,
coupled with a picture of Lady Dia-
na’s seductive royal proﬁle.

We think the press did a royally
good job (tut-tut) of repressing Lady
Diana’s sordid background. "So
what if she’s a finishing school drop-
out. The job description of Queen
says nothing of intelligence—just

breeding. Witness -her’ mother-in-
law. - -

We are glad to see the American
press, unlike their British news-
h_ound_ tmlnterparts, hav§_refuse_d__t_o
fall so gullibly for the idol worship-
ping that this wedding represents.
They have represented Lady Diana
for the beacon of feminism that she
is. Who could be a better symbol of
women's liberation than a kinder-
garten teacher, marrying fresh out of

her teens, for the sole purpose of .

raising more royal kids? Why pol-
lute the genetic pool with minds like
Royal gelatin? Hmm?

Why ‘_'pollut'e thegenetic

pool with minds like Royal _

gelatin? Hmm?‘

Prince Charles. further,-is every
man's dream: 32, unempIoyed,'liv-
ing at home...no wonder there has
been so much celebration of this
wedding. Perhaps the British press,
was beginning to wonder if the kilts
were justa uniform. The Prince also
serves as a good representitive of the

British common wo'rker—he has no
job.

The celebration of this wedding
has already begun in some urban
areas of England: Blacks in Brixton
have been throwing firebombs out
of sheer ecstasy, and some lrish in
Northern Ireland are so excited they
can’t even eat.

‘ The press’ investigative reporting
into the slaughtering of 50 bears to
make helmets_for the Cold Stream
Guards was rude and uncalled for.
Prince Philip, the Queen’s husband,

3"‘

who is head ofa British conservation -

movement, was simply practicing
population control among the bears.
Those in the media who ‘character-
ized the skinning of these animals as
a “terrible waste” obviously do not
realize the importance of the guard
sporting pseudo-Davy Crockett
caps.

All in all, the day’s events were as »
_ enlightening as the Prince’s ﬁre-
’ "cracker personality and as thought-

provoking as Lady, Diana’s fab
wit.We hope that the royal couple
stays royally bound, since this wed-

‘ding provided enough excitement.
_ for us tostand for awhile.

. Dear Editor:

It is an old adage that one ‘should .
not take on another job when the

responsibilities and demands of the -

first cannot be adequately fulﬁlled.
At such a critical time when the

School of Medicine is ‘threatened 

with further deterioration and "per-
haps even collapse, it is inconceiva-
ble that Dr. Leon continues to serve
as president of a major corporation,
the University Health Center, while

_at the. same time he struggles with

many problems in the School of
Medicine. Can you imagine a stu-
dent at Pitt workingta full-time job
while pursuing his medical studies?
Here are just some of the problems
facing the School of Medicine: _

_ I. Under Dr. Leon, ‘tuition for
state residents at Pitt has soared to ’
' $9,000 (with assurances from Dr.
 Posvar that the tuition increasenext

year will be even greater than this i

year's increase). Pitt is now the most

‘ expensive state-related -medical
_ school in thiscountry: the Univer-
sity of Pittsburghrepresents the only .

"publicly-supported medical school
in America where tuition exceeds
the federally deﬁned poverty level,

,_ which is $8,450 for a family offour. ,

.' “ 2. Dean Leon is on public record

acknowledging that the medical

- school is suffering‘ from '“ afcserious . .
lack of leadership.” What better way", '

Molly Rush, PlowshareEight,
  Convicted, Face‘ Prison Terms

NORRISTOWN, PA. AP -“His-
tory will be the judge” of the Plow-
shares Eight, said a Montgomery
County judge who sentenced the
peace activist Berrigan brothers and
six others to jail Tuesday for their
part in’ a demonstration against
nuclear weaponry.

Judge Samuel W. Salus 11 sent-
enced the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, 60,
and his brother, Philip, to 3-to-l0
years in a state prison for their par-
ticipation in a break-in,at the Gen-
eral Electric Re-entry ‘Division
assembly plant last September.

All eight anti-nuclear activists
were convicted March 6 of entering
the GE plant insuburban King of
Prussia, battering two Mark l2A
missile nose cones and pouring
human blood on equipment and
classified documents.

Although he said the group’s paci-
fist convictions raised a “meritor-
ious issue," Salus concluded “the

bottom line is the defendants vio-~

lated the criminal law and liberty has

its bounds."

ln imposing substantial sentences,
Salus said the defendants showed
“arrogance” and “intolerance” and

added their actions have been
“reserved heretofore for proven
prophets.”

Salus then revoked bail and, as
the defendants led their supporters
in reciting the Lord’s Prayer, sher-
iffs’ deputies escorted them from the
crowded courtroom. .

“We are willing to go to jail for
our version of the truth," Philip

‘Berrigan, 57, told the judge before

sentencing. “Our version of the truth
is we acted legally, according to the
law of God....The criminals are GE
and the U.S. government for devel-
oping these weapons.”

“You must live the truth, not just
mouth it," he added. The Plow-
shares Eight take theirname from
the biblical prediction that people
will someday beat their swords into
plowshares. I '

eholarship List Doesn’t Include Lewis, Yet  

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

July 20: “Debbie Lewis is a great
point guard. She did an excellentjob
for us last year. Ninety-fiye percent
of the time she did an otitstanding
job. If she didn’t play or whatever, if
she didn't do thejob, I told her. Just
like anybody, if they don’t do the
right thing, they’re told. ‘
+Pitt head basketball coach Judy

Saurer

July 24: Debbie “Day" (Lewis)
has already fulfilled her four years of
scholarship...anything over and
above is gravy."

—Judy Saurer

Pitt Pantherette point guard and

co-captain Debbie Lewis is two
points away from I479 and from

becoming the Panthetettes’ all-time

leading scorer, and she has led the
team in steals with 78 and 80 the last
two seasons. ln. her junior season
last year, Lewis, a pre-season All-
America candidate, also led the

team with l 30 assists and was second

in both field goal percentage (.5l0)
and scoring average ( l4.2 per game).

There is one other compelling fact
concerning Lewis and Pantherette
basketball: she is not listed among
the 10 Pantherettes to whom scho-
larship aid has been extended by Pitt
Pantherette basketball coach Judy
Saurer.

The list, obtained with Saurer’s
consent through her office, includes
returning players Lori Arent, Gail

‘\

Aughburn, Carol Dugan, Lynn
Love, Pam Miklasevich and Beth
Tarasi and recruits Stephanie’Col—
lins, LaRochelle Daniels, Lori Lew-
man and Becky Maziarkz.

Two scholarship cases are still
pending, according to Saurer, which
would bring the team total to I2, the
maximum number of scholarships
allowed under AlAW rules.

One of the pending cases involves
Saurer’s final recruit, transfer stu-
dent Jennifer Bruce. Bruce, the sister
of former Pitt basketball star Kirk
Bruce, comes to Pitt by way ofTen-
nessee Tech. Saurer is waiting for a

« ruling from the AIAW to confirm’

whether or not Bruce can recieve a
scholarship. '

“I would hope the AIAW would.

grant Jennifer one, "but I think

0

they’ve notoriously been a group not
to do that sort.ofthing,“Saurer said.
“It would be a welcome surprise for
her and for me as well.” ‘

The other case, still pending,
involves guard Sue Koziol, who
Saurer is not exp"ecting to return to
Pitt. Koziol is supposedly transfer-
ring to Cleveland State to play closer
to home. -

Under AIAW rules, an institution
must send aid renewal forms to its
athletes by July 1, and an athlete has
I4 days to return the form express-
ing their intention to return .to
school. If an athlete returns the form
signed by the deadline, the aid is
renewed.

“The university was obligated to
send Sue Koziol a contract, but l’m
99.9 percent sure she’s not return-

  
 

nearly7,090;" ’  , »

ing," Saurer said Thursday. “Sue.

walked into my office last Sep-
tember 8 and said she didn’t like
Pittsburgh and desired to returnéto
Cleveland. It was certainly no sur-
prise to me.“

Which leaves Lewis’case. Because
of a medical redshirt for a broken
foot she sustained her freshman sea-
son, Lewis will be entering her fifth
year at Pitt, with one year ofplaying
eligibility remaining. So far, accord-

ing to Saurer, Lewis has been on

scholarship all four years. '
Considering I0 aid contracts have
already been awarded and two are
pending, simple mathematics show
Lewis was never sent an aid renewal
form for the upcoming season.

NCAA Plans
For Women’s
Title Series

By JOHNETTEJ HOWARD -

Pitt News Sports Editor

It took over 100 years, but the
NCAA is ﬁnally offering women
admission to their own version of
the event former Marquette coach
Al McGuire calls “the big dance."

“The big dance” is otherwise
known as the NCAA Division I bas-

ketball championships, and until ' *3,

this year, only the men competed
with the NCAA's blessings. Now,
thar1ks‘to a decision at January’s
annual convention, the NCAA will
begin offering women's champion-
ships beginning with the l98l-82
season.

During their transition period5 _

from the Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women (AIAW)
tothe NCAA, the NCAA is giving
its new~women affiliates the option
of following AIAW or NCAA rules.
for the l98l-82 season. Even if an
institution does follow AIAW rules,
they can still . participate in the
NCAA’s championships this year.
. -Both the NCAA'and AIAW are pro-
hibiting the institutions from com-
peting in both championships.
Currently, Pitt is‘ planning to
compete for the NCAA’s champion-
ship in gymnastics and basketball,
and perhaps swimming, although all
Pantherette teams will continue
complying with AIAW rules during
the upcoming year. ‘
Bullman was in Cape Cod

A recently for the NCAA Women’s

Division I National Committee
meetings, where the details were laid
down for the I981-82 basketball
-championships. _ - '
According to Bullman, the Div-
ison l championship will, be held
March 28\at Old Dominion Univer-
sityvin Virginia this year, with the

regional and semi-final round games 5

to be played at predetermined sites,
March 18-21 and March 26, respec-
tively. First-round contests, will be
played March I2-l4 on-the home
court of one of the two compe-Tting
teams.’ ‘ ,

The tournament will be set up in a
32-team bracket, divided’ into four
regional areas: :West, Midwest,
Mideastand East. Teams will be
selected on their win-loss records

By JOHNETTE HOWARD '

Pitt News Sports Editor

After months of speculation
and talk and political orchestrat-
ing, the supporters of the pro-
posed Eastern sports league are
about to take their first concrete
step toward formation ofthe new
conference.

Officials——mostly athletic
directors—from seven Eastern
schools, including Pitt, Penn
State, Syracuse, Temple, Boston
College, Rutgers and West Virgi-
nia, met July 2| in Cape Cod and
agreed to hire a consultant or
group of consultants to investi-
gate the formation of an Eastern
league.

The consultants are expected
to recommend ways to best con-
struct the league, based on the
operations and histories of exist-
ing conferences. The consultants

will also investigate the logistics
of starting a league in the East,
including the study of available
television markets.

Although Pitt Athletic Direc-
tor Cas Myslinski mentioned no
names of the consultants, he
said, “We have located a couple
of people who have been com-;
missioners of conferences. Those
are the people we want to really
pick the brains of."

Myslinski said most of last
Tuesday's meeting was spent
“trying to get various littlethings
worked out”. _

“We discussed ‘things like.how
much money each school will be
required to put into the kitty to
get things started and how much"
we’ll need for front office opera-
tions and other expenses,” Mys- ’
linski added.

Now that the investigation in
the league’s actual formation has

been started, the next step for the ‘F
would—be members will most
likely be the hiring of a league
commissioner. The job may be
offered to the former conference
commissioner the league has I
hired as a consultant, according
to Myslinski.

“We'll probably offer it to the
consultant first, and if he doesn’t
want the job then we’ll have to
look for someone else,” Mys-
linski said.

The next meeting of the pro-
posed league’s universities is
scheduled for'Aug. 21 in Atlant ,
site .of the Collegiate Footbal

S Association meeting. The CFA is

another proposed league that
would include the top 60 or so
major collegiate football powers,
who would basically be buckin_g
the current NCAA system for the
right to negotiate their own high-
priced television contract.

rEastern League Step Closer,

Pitt’s attendance at the CFA
meeting isjust one more example
of “keeping the door open” to all
its alternatives, that include the
Eastern 8, CFA and the Big East.

“We have a lot of burners
going," said Myslinski, in a gem
of an __u,n_d_e_rst_a_t_ement. I

But, if actions speak louder
thanwords, Pitt would prefer an
all-sports Eastern league to
form, and soon. Myslinski said
he would “not necessarily” rule
out a start of play for the league
by the l982'season, although he
added “we would need to realign . "
our schedules like basketball as
soon as possible.”

One roadblock to the ‘basket-
ball portion of the East league is
Syracuse, who is balking at leav- ,
ing the lucrative Big East league
for an all-sports East conference.

Syracuse ‘Athletic Director
Jack Crouthamel took a hard

line publicly late last week,
emphasizing ' his school was '

football and not basketball;
should the new league come off. r

Myslinski shrugged off Crou--
thamel’s remarks, as would be
expected, considering Pitt, and
not Syracuse, holds the key to.
the East league and is in a better
position to make demands’. Even
Penn State Athletic Director and
football coach Joe Paterno con-
cedes, without Pitt’ any Eastern
football league is meaningless.

And Myslinski knows it. "

regarding Crouthamel’s

televise the NCAA women’s final

live, beginni_ng'this year. CBS-TV
. owns the television rights to the '

women’s final, as well as the NCAA
men’s~ final, for the next three years.

benefits, mostly cost related, in addi-

‘ tion to the added exposure the tie-

student affairs, who handles aid
renewal for Saurer, and Saurer her-
self pretty much confirmed this fact.

“I'm not about/to offer 13 (schol-
arships) when I only have 12 to
give,” Saurer said. “l.’m too good a
businesswoman to over book the
hotel,”

Said Sprague, on"July 20:““You A

must send out aid renewals by July

I, and the athletes have I4 days to’

return. them.”

When asked if it was_too late to

renew the aid of any returning ath-I
letes, Sprague said, “Do you have

anybody in/ mind? All_of our aid, -

renewals are out. So, there’s nobody

' in that category here.”

All of which doesn't mean Lewis
will not ultimately recieve a scholar-
ship next year, despite Saurer's corn-
ment about Lewis’ exclusion that

,“well, it doesn’t meanpeople can’t

play without money."~Saurer said
Thursday that “yesterday, just yes-

terday, I recieved information from
» the AlAW concerning a fifth"-year .
’ scholarship.” '

A fifth-year scholarship is a new
rule the AIAW passed early this

‘ year. It permits institutions to offer

an additional yea-r of scholarship,
beyond the usual four-year» commit-
tment, inspecial cases, including
medical redshirting. If also is not

AN EVENING OF WOODY ALLEN
Written by Woody Allen

Directed by Michael McGovern
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre
Comedy Alliance

By THOM PALMER

The Comedy Alliance, a branch of
the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre
that specializes in comedy (what
else?) premiered with two seldom-
staged o_ne-act plays by Woody Allen:
Death Knocks and God. \

The premise of Death Knocks, an
extremely short play, is rather sim~_
ple; 57-year-old Nat Ackerman (Phil

~Thompson)'is sitting in his home late
one night reading as Death (Gerry
Bonifate) comes to take him away.
Ackerman, of eourse, is not prepared
to die, and his reluctance is further

strengthened by the poor impression "P

his Death makes on him. The oafish
Grim Reaper in‘ this play seems
ture has made him out to be.

While the premise issimple, the
subsequent ripples are a bit more
complex. It achieves something that
normally dictates the fate of a stage
comedy. Death is that classic conflict

of the theatre (remember ”to be or -

not to be”), but when Allen turns it

into soniething as familiar as a con—.

versation with one’s neighboror co-

worker," he , establishes an

unshakable comic base that can only
9-’ be destroyed through real perserve‘r-
J ance or alteration of the text.

As Death then makes its entrances
through Ackerman's window and
stumbles to the floor, the audience is
immediately hooked. ‘

All there is, then, is to sit back and
follow the manipulation of Death and
the dying, and what makes some-

‘ thing with at great comic base-.flower
into a great comic play is the ensuing-
dialogue. _ / A

There is an interesting formula

J nately for him, it seems inexhausti-

 

This year's Three Rivers ake-
speare Festival stepped out into the

deep waters of drama with its pro- 

duction ofThe Winter's Tale.
The play is difficult for almost eve’-
. ryone who comes to it. There is no
comfortable ‘fit into either tragic or
comedic catagories. Critics have"

called _ it unbelievable, poorly—_.

constructed, and dramatically‘ inco-

'“herant. For these reasons, A.Winter's
.Ta_le isan interesting choice for the
fourth production in the Festival's
history. ’ T *

. A’

The cast of An

ble. That is, the juxtaposing of loftier, .
philosophical mysteries‘ with the
—material banalities of the ‘familiar,
physical world. Once,_ he estabishes
these two obtuse forms as existing ~
side.by side on the same stage, the
rest seems almost effortless.
DEATH:.What ‘is wrong with "you? You
see the black‘ costume and the whitened face?
NAT: Yeah. T
DEATH: is it Halloween?- -

NAT: No. . T _
DEATH: Then I'm death. Now can Itget a
glass of water-—or.a Fresca? . \

V And so on. Butjthere is an element
to the dialogue and the conflict that
seems slightly contradictory’ to
Comedy Alliance's rendition. The
characters have too much spice. Nat
Ackerman hardly seems convinced
throughout the play that he is dealing . A

- Twentieth centurylcritic Sir Arthur p
Quiller-Couch, in the 1931 edition of,
the ”New" Cambridge Winter's Tale," '
,went so far as to regard these ele-
ments as ”absurdities of (composi-
tion.” ' " 1.
Modern analysts have refuted this

The dialogue between the~two has a
feeling of understatement running

through "it, but Phil Thompson as .

‘Ackerman and director Michael
McGovern don't seem to adhere to
this. This understatement tone
weaves in"and out of the perfor-
mance, whereas it should remain
constant. Thompson seems too

smug, too worried, and too brash all P

the potency of thematerial.

portrayal of Death as a self-conscious

sideline...’

By MARY KANE

Perhaps you recognize the type of
person offered by the following des-
cription: he or she speaks louder than

_ is normally required, gestures wildly '

while making a<point in a discussion,

 and construes something as banal as a

hangnail into a life-threatening,
‘earth-shattering emergency medical

'_ situation.

T Ah . . . of course, a frustrated actor.

'  No doubt, those afflicted with this

foo'tlight—h‘ungry disease find their
exact opposite in Pitt English profes-
sor Christopher Rawson. If anything,
Rawson could be portrayed as a sort
of frustrated English teacher, at least

' when it comes to acting.

"The important thing about me is
that I'm an English teacher, who does
acting as a sideline,” Rawson said.

\ "My first priority is teaching.”

But the little bit of ham in all of us
needs an ’ outlet somewhere. For
Rawson, this is found in several Pitt
theatre productions, including Rosen-
crantz and Gildenstern are Dead, When You
Comin' Back, Red Ryder? and last term's
Look Back in Anger. _

In Look Back in Anger,‘ Rawson played
the part of Jimmy, a character he's

‘ always _been interested in doing. He

mild characters in .a Pittsburgh_
Laboratory Theatre production, so‘

he can test his breadth. ,
Rawson's,inte_rest in theatre ”goes
back a long way.” He acted exten-
sively at Harvard, originally majoring
in theatre before deciding he wanted
to be an English professor. What
brought about his change of mind is

too complicated to quickly explain, he-

‘said, but the experience is beneficial
to himnow when he teaches Shakes-
peare and drama in his courses.

To avoid crowding his teaching
duties, Rawson hasvusuallly only per-
formed in one or two plays ayear. He
often goes tosee theatre productions
and reviews theatre for four maga-
zines and a local radio station. /

vard), on a full scholarship for drama, '

is involved in an intensive schedule of
acting and teaching that comes as a

result of his ”re-discovering,” theatre

this spring.) _

for the‘ next. Davin began his Hart.-,

woodv Acres season with The Man-
‘drake, "which Davin described as
;"bordering- on physical slapstick,"

"then continued with the Heartbreak-

_House.

”The role ’I have now. is my most ‘

challenging one/"Dav'in‘said. '-‘I play

 tionship, a not-so-admirable charac-

ter to some critics.
Rawson explained that to play the

 role of Jimmy, or any role ina play, an
actor has to be able to understand:
-. what motivates hischaracter.

"'Good actors never completely
identify with a character because

they're not supposed to be ‘playing ‘

themselves," Rawson said. ”You have

_to find ways to understand the char-

acter in your own terms.”

Rawson wanted to play Jimmy, as

f  much for exploring his character as

for being_in'a play that generated con-

' troversy and excitement when it first

opened in 195'Z—and still holds an
audience.‘ ' ‘ '

He said he's generally interested in

;strong, energetic,demanding parts,

 much like the character ofjimrny. In

' the ,fall, however, he'll be experi-

 menting with one of Ibsen’s,weal< and

the theatre’.

Whenyhe is performing in-a play
during aterm when he's teaching, the
play becoines part of the classroom
itself; he teaches the th,_emegand rea-

soning of the playuin class and acts the V V
‘ part‘on' stage. . " "

For R_awson,‘acting part-time has
its good and bad sides.

J The degree of polish found in 'pro— ‘

fessjonal‘ theatre isn't quite attained

byia part-time production. But eve- "

Harvard in particular. There he spent
four years training with classmates
such as Christopher Reeves, and
learning every aspect of the theater
from directing to stage design.

But the problem of getting the
message across to the people who
weren't listening——especially during
the 60's, when there was quite alot to

controversial.

In the fall, Davin will be back at Pitt
taching newswriting classes, and
limit his theater involvement,at least
in established productions. But if all
the world's a stage, the classroom is
no exception. .

"Any teacher has to be a good"
’actor,”V Davin said. ”There's basically

say'—took its toll of Davin's enthusi-
asm for acting. Although performing
became secondary for him, relaying
the message didn't. He began to look
at education as a means of social
change, and in the early 70's, began to
experiment with alternative educa-
tion methods.
Davin then again found himself at
- Harvard, this time for graduate work
in education. But when he found that

Harvard was more interested in pro— '

ducing administrators than teachers,
it seemed to him that education
wasn't serving the purpose he had
hoped it would. So, he _”sort 4‘ of
stumbled ‘into writing," working first
for a newspaper in Cambridge, then
writing home‘-design articles for the
Boston HeraId—/imerican. When a friend
of his got a job in Pittsburgh, he came
. here, too, and made two observations
of the city: first, it's not quite the
smokey, dirty city it had a reputation
of being; and second, it needed a
newspaper that handled issues that
‘established papers wouldn't. Davin

began writing for two weekly news— -

papers, the New Sunahd the Pittsburgh
East, soon becoming editor of the New
Sun. Last spring, he won two Golden
Quill awards,_which recognizes out-
standing journalism in Pittsburgh.
He received the awards after being
fired V by the newspaper's owner
because, _according to Davin, the
»owner believed the articles were too

one aspect of being a good'teacher—
retaining the interest of the students.
It takes a lack of inhibition to be a
good teacher. ._ _

”But it gets very frustrating some-
times}, You can feel your talking to a
classroom full_ of Calvin Coolidges,
and getting any response is like pul-
ling teeth.”

Davin said most of the students are
apathetic about their education,and
share _a general trend of disinterest in
school. Most students, he believes,

aren't concerned with anything but

having a good time. But, when Sep-
tember rolls around, he'll be back at
Pitt, ‘ still trying to get a message
across.

Dan Frezza gets up in the morning,

throws on a casual shirt and a pair of if

pants, and rushes to Applied Science

spendshis sday busy with meetings

Dan Frezza, former Pitt researcher, has been involved in local acting"

productions since 1962. ' -
frezza, who-pfeviously worked at
Pitt's Learning "Research and. Devel-

\

opment Center, has-been in local act- ’
ing‘ productions since he came to Pitt_

as an undergraduate in 1962.

He said it's hard to pinpoint what _'

exactly got him interested in acting,
it's just that he liked doing it.

_”l usually stick pretty close to the
college scene,” he says, adding that
the shows he's beeninhave been con-
nected with Pitt, Duquesne, and Cha-
tham. He could also be considere_d a
vetern ofathe Shakespeare Festival,
having acted in las_t year's production

’ of The Taming of the Shrew.

‘ favorite roles, because of its combina-

tion of elements; ' ' '

"...it's all it matter of

changing roles from as

«stadioas scientist to” a

Shakespearean king.

‘'1 like a role that cornbines‘—th.e
tragic, the comedic, and the lyrical_,'f-
he says. "It's rare that you find airolee
with all three." »  »  f
‘ F-rezza usually finds himself doing‘
one or two -shows a year,‘which suits"
him fine, because he said it's_not_all
that easy to balance -an’8:3O to '5 job
with an acting career.. \ f  
For The Winter's Tale-, as an example:
heperforms ‘eight times a week; and
rehearsed from 7 to 11 p.m. every.

‘ evening‘ before the show opened-’ '_'

_ Despite the drain of his sparetime,
'Frezza plans to'co_ntinue playing in
local theater productions. For him,

it's‘ all a‘ matter of changing from a«
studious scientist to a Shakespearean

public. But, unless you've got ‘money

onltheblink again, at least half of

' these films aren't worth seeing. Take

.'S.,O.B., for example...Director Blake

 Edwargsi though well-known and

e  etting g

/

respected, rarely makes a movie that
doesn't rely on an actor's perfor-
mance to pull it off. Return of the Pink
Panther and 10, for example, depended
on comic geniuses like Peter Sellers
and Dudley Moore, for their success.
S.O.B. has a competent cast of
actors——indeed, part of the film's
problem may be that there are too
many famous -faces on the screen)-—
but no single person who is good
enough to stand out as a lead. Per-
haps Edwards was hoping that.
Richard Mulligan, as Felix Farmer,
would fill the shoes of someone like,

. say, a Peter Sellers. But, Mulligan,

best known a Burt on TV’s Soap,

never gets beyond the sort of manic '

acting—broad gestures and bizarre

facial expressions—that he does

on Soap. In all fairness, though, the
script really doesn't give him much-to
work with. V / ' '

,S.O.B. is the story.of a successful
Hollywood director (Mulligan) who
makes a costly flop, is scorned by the
people who‘ once loved him, goes
crazy, and decides to reshoot part of
his film and turn it into a soft porn
movie. Alongthe way, we are intro-
duced to an assorted array of slimy

revenge -since this is a semi-
autobiographical story. Loretta

I Swit's character, a stereotypical gos-

sipcolumnist, is much too obnoxious
to’ be convincing and ’ Robert
Vaughn’s character, a studio execu-
tive, is too stupid tobe convincing.
Appearances by Shelley Winters,
Marisa Berenson, and Larry Storch
seem to have been thrown in without
any justification. A big to—do is made

‘ about Julie Andrews, as Mulligan’s

A wife, taking off her clothes in one of

the re-shot scenes. Will she or won't
she? She does, and like the rest of the
movie, it's no big deal....Stripes, on
the other hand, is one of the
summer's funnier movies. Be fore-
'warned, though, if you [didn't like
sophomoric classics like Animal House
and Meatballs, you won't, enjoy this

apartment all in the same day. Watch-
ing a commercial on T.V. telling him

._what the Army can do for him, he

decides to enlist, convincing his best
friend to do the same. His platoon
consists of low I.Q. scorers, over-
weight slobs, and one character based
on the Robert DeNiro role in‘Taxi
Driver who's just itching to kill some-
body. To top things off, Murray
doesn't get along with his platoon
sergeant (Warren Oates), an Army

   Past

tough-guy who makes Comer Pyle’s

sergeant look good. Understanding’

why the fwo don't get along is easy:
Murray's character is a smart ass who
talks back to his superiors-—when the
sergeant asks him what he thinks'of
the punishment he's about to dole
out,» Murray replies, .’-’I think it
sucks,"-—and who.is constantly get-
ting himself and others into trouble.

David (Martin Hewitt) and Jade

.. (Brooke Shields) are two young high
schoolers who fall in loveand quickly
become full—fledged lovers. But their
love becomes an obsession, trans-
porting them into a worldin which
they have lost all control. "
The film's premise sounds feasible,
right? It could be, if it weren't for a
few wrinkles that turn into incurable
creases; The main problem: is that
we're supposed to like most of these
characters and sympathizegwith
them, but we don't, and why should
we? They're spoiled, promiscuous,

selfish, and just plain annoying. A‘

point is made in the film about today's
sexual openness and the need not to
be hypocritical_ about it ("...this isn't

the Dark Ages anymore..."). But

when jade, 15 years old, says good-’

night to her parents and then traipses
up to her room ‘to sleep with David,
16 years old,‘and her parents barely
bat an eye (they know all about it),

est this movie really is‘. When David is
asked not to see Jade for a few weeks,
he sets her house on fire, entertain-

_ ing the romantic notion that he'll

rescue her and her family, and thus
become their hero, we feel confused

To become a security guard in’the

consist of ”SIT DOWN TAKE YOUR
FEET OFF THAT NO SMOKING

As soon as the 1981 Tubes World

began, Tubes vocalist Fee Waybill

leered into the mike.

"Look, I made a deal with these
guys and if you don't trample. each
other or stand on the seats, you can
come down front...they’re really nice
guys”

Fee, as frontman for the Tubes,
still takes his satire pretty seriously.

Every night in their songs, they'd be
getting ready to rev 'em up. But what
about the driver's girl friend who is
slowly fuming because her boy has
found a new lovein life? Well, youget

about, but the Go Go's do it with such
flare and drive that you forget bands

funk,,Broadway show music,._reggae,
and Latin and you've got an idea of
the mix. Though’ alltthese different
styles have their place, it's the pop

sensibility that overlays this melange 

and holds it together.
' , Seriously, August.Darnell, the_cre—

 

ator of all this enlightened insanity,
would rather be writing ‘musical
comedies than anything else. What
he's done is created such a musical
without the visuals ‘(though that's
alleviated live). Live, he creates a
world of bright primary colors, beau-
tiful women in slinky tropical outfits
and the like‘. That's the reports any-
way, but all we have to go-on is the
record.

This is the first record, in a long
time that lawould simply describe as
alluring. Darnell and his cre-w are out
for fun and they're takinghyou along

' for the ride. Picking out bits and pie-

ces isn't really helpful in describing
the show. Like any good theatre pres-
entation, you just absorb the whole
and then sit back and be impressed.

Feel free to applaud. A

-"TELL ME A STORY” BIW
"LOOSE ENDS" .

- The Natives
Delso. Records

Though not exactly a breath of
‘fresh air, the first release by New
York's Natives is substantially more
than just another effort. For young
musicians, the sound on this single is
astonishingly fluid. "Tell Me a Story”
is freshjwith the tight beat missing
from most comparable spawning
bands. "Loose Ends”ihas.the same
beat, but has an undefinablehdig that

' doesn't catch‘ right""away.

Even if the vocals are at times
shrill,'they are in perfect proportion

 

withjt-he sound as a whole." Rockers in .

their crucialgformative years,.this sin- '

gle is indicative of the Natives’ just
post-,pubescent Pretenders style and
image. Both songs ‘capture the
essence of the band's live show; ‘the

 energy’ and zeal fill inany holes left: by
. technicaliimperfection. P
