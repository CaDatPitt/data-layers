VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 64

Pitt professor Tom Buchele addressed a crowd of about 30 protesters who gath-

A few dozen protesters gathered
outside the Cathedral of Learning
yesterday, demonstrating in support
of preserving the Allegheny
National Forest and against what
protesters said is a Pittdecision that
adversely affects that area and the
wildlife there.

The protest was fueledlin part’

by an open letter to the University
community from Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg. In the letter,
Nordenberg suggests that, due to
political controversy surrounding
Pitt’s Environmental Law Clinic,
the clinic should end its affiliation

I  » with the University. »

The controversy stems. from at
least“ one Pennsylvania se.nator’s

discontent with a case Professor

Tom Buchele, director of the clinic,

-represented on_ behalf of the

Allegheny Defense Project and five
other conservation groups.

_ According to Buchele, the work he

did was on his own time, and was

The case, which aimed at_ pro-I

tecting the Allegheny National

Forest, caused state Senator Joseph

Scarnati, R—Brockway, to sponsor
legislation restricting ‘ the
University from providing state
funding to the Environmental Law
Clinic.

, In his letter, Nordenberg criti-
cized Buchele,- saying that “the
University has paid a steep price for
its support of the involved faculty
members,” citing the loss of
approximately $150,000 to
$200,000 which legislators with-
drew after the controversial case.

“A much higher ‘cost, though,
has come in theform of lost oppor-
tunity,” the letter said.

_ protesters, though, . did not
define the issue in terms of money,
but values.

“The big question is, where is
academic freedom? Apparently it
doesn’t exist at the University of
Pittsburgh and if we don’t have aca-
demic freedom,.,wh”at”have we got?”
said Marilyn Skolnick, conservation
chair of the Sierra Club.

KRS-ONE reﬂects on the advancement of ‘Hip Hop’

LINDSAY BANE
Staff Writer

“Hip Hop” is not a black thing. It is not rap. The
“Hip” does not stand for “trendy” and the “Hop” does
not stand for “dance.” It is capitalized as Italian and
Irish would be capitalized, because “Hip Hop” is a cul-
ture, a collective consciousness, according to legendary
hip-hopper KRS—ONE.

When he stepped up to the podium in the William
Pitt Union’s Assembly Room last night, he greeted the

crowd by saying “Now throw yo’ hands in the air.” But.

instead of performing, KRS-ONE followed his lyrics
with-a lecture. . .
For two and a half hours KRS-ONE, Knowledge

I Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone, gave lessons in

spelling, history, philosophy, ethics and what it_ takes to
really be “Hip Hop.”

Hip-hop is everything from “Breakin” to “Graﬁtti”
to the clothes you wear, he said, emphatic about the fact

' that the two are capitalized proper nouns. It is a way of
living, KRS-ONE said as he raised laminated cards with '

the correct spelling of several commonly misspelled

hip-hop words. ,

“It is important to know what Hip Hop is because
no matter what you do, especially in the -U.S., you are
going to be approached by this tenn,” KRS-ONE told
his audience. ' '

Thick books of history timelines sat on the table
next to him.~Though he could trace hip-hop’s history

back to the initial “needle dropping technique” in 1972, g

the books failed to mention hip-hop until 1990. As a
critical part of hip-hop’s history, KRS-ONE told not
only his side of the story, he said, but also the real time-
line behind it. _

KRS-ONE said he could recall the years when hip-
hop was illegal. Kids would get arrested or beaten by
the police“ for “Emceein” or “Deejayin” in the park, he
said. In 1979, when The Sugarhill Gang put out

_“Rapper’s Delight,” hip-hop art was permitted on the

streets. «
“If it makes money for'white corporate America,
it’s legal. I saw it with my own eyes,” he said.
According to KRS-ONE, hip-hop makes enough
money to ﬁnance a war. By 2004, it will be a $3 billion
industry, enough to buy South Africa, KRS-ONE spec-

ulated.

,\ “You must be willing to fmd ways to exist outside
of white supremacy,” KRS-ONE said. He said that you
don’t have to be a minority to be trapped in white
supremacy. “White supremacy traps white people too.”

According to 'KRS-ONE, “white kids” were a large
part of the demographic that chose to listen to rappers
such as NWA over more socially conscious music.
Radio stations are now more inclined to play artists with
less positive representations of the black community, he
said, because they make the most money.

Though he confronted a wide array of social and

political issues, KRS-ONE broke his lesson down to
one message: “Never accept what’s in front of you.
Know it. Be prepared to transform it.”

He traced the basis of this idea back to pioneer rap
artist -Grandmaster Flash, and once more to French
philosopher Rene Descartes,’ “I think, therefore I am.”

With little sign of exhaustion after two and a half

“hours of speaking, KRS-ONE left the room with a final

thought on what deﬁnes hip-hop.
“Hip Hop is victory over the streets and it is open to
anyone who wants peace, love, unity and happiness.”

Leslie Bonci, director of sports nutrition at UPMC Presbyterian, instructed an
audience on healthy holiday eating yesterday.

Sports nutritionexpcrt offers her
recipe for healthy holiday eating

ISTEPHANIE FERNANDES
The Pitt News

According to Leslie Bonci, it’s possi-
blc to enjoy holiday foods without ending
up looking like Santa Claus.

Bonci is the director of sports nutri-
tion at UPMC Presbyterian, and suggests
that eating smaller, more frequent meals,
eating tasty, enjoyable foods and taking
time out to relax with a cup of tea are
simple methods of enjoying holiday
treats while still monitoring a healthy
diet. ’

There are tricks to using low-fat
foods and desirable dishes —— in small
portions -—— to pamper the palate, Bonci
said.

She said soy protein can be substitut-
ed for proteins from red meat, chicken or
ﬁsh, and that soy products help protect
against breast, prostate and other malig-
nant cancers. But, she said, soy pills
aren’t the way to go. Instead, she sug-
gestcd consuming about three low-fat
dairy foods ——ranging from low-fat milk
to yogurt or low-fat cheese —— in order to
consume the requisite amount of soy.

According to Bonci, there’s room for
alcohol in a healthy diet -—— but only in
small portions. One ounce of alcohol per
day for women has been found to reduce
the risk of breast cancer. Alcohol is a
blood thinner and decreases the chance of

stroke as long as it is taken into the body
in safe proportions. It also lowers choles-
terol and reduces the risk of heart disease.

Fruits and vegetables serve as great
antioxidants and are vital in keeping

body cells healthy, she said. The deeper A

the color, the more nutritious the‘ food.
Bonci said that deep orangc- and yellow-

colored foods are good for the eyes. Red, V

purple or blue fruit—1ikc berries and
plums are good for the memory.

Tomatoes help reduce the risk of prostate 1

cancer. White or green vegetables such
as onions, garlic, chives, and leeks con-
tain ally sulﬁdes that may decrease the
risk of tumors.

Tea, she said, is very ‘beneﬁcial not
only therapeutically, but also because it
reduces the risk of heart disease and cav-
ities. Bonci recommends drinking at least
two cups of brewed tea per day.

And although herbal tea docsn’t offer_

the same beneﬁts, it’s‘ helpful to healthy
relaxation.

. Bonci offered “a few ﬁnal thoughts, A

aimed at maintaining good health during

the holiday season. “Make eating a prior— v I

ity, not the afterthought,” she said.

She advised those in attendance to’
eat when they are hungry, not categoriz-
ing foods as either “good” or “bad.” And
above all, she instructed healthful hope-

fuls to make changes in eating habits A

gradually.

Buchele expressed frustration

with several aspects of the chancel—_

“Despite the fact that he has
said in the past that‘he supported

doesn’t show that,” he said. “It’s
unfortunate that he chose a forum in

He also said that he feels the

things incorrectly and leaves some
other things out completely.

“Completely absent from the
letter was‘ any mention of the
important work the clinic does rep-
resenting groups who can’t afford
legal representation. Those people
are citizens of Pennsylvania, too,”
Buchele said. 2

‘Representatives of several of
these groups were present at the
rally and spoke in support of the
Environmental Law Clinic, and
criticized the chancellor for buck-
ling under political pressure.

“Professor Buchele was willing
to represent us in federal court as a
grassroots organization that can’t

afford our own representation,”
said Jim Kleisser, forest watch
‘director of the Allegheny Defense
Project.

. Robert Silver, a representative
from Clean Water Action, also
spoke at the rally.

“I’m a little surprised that the,

University has acted in such a
severe manner,” he said. “I wonder
what the folks who started the clin-
ic, who allowed it to exist, what
they thought the clinic was going to
be doing. Did they think they" were
going to go after litterbugs?”

Silver encouraged students and
alumni to contact Nordenberg and
other legislators. ’

Several students also expressed
their support for the Environmental
Law Clinic. While many of the

.,«speakers emphasized the impor-
tance of the clinic for its environ-
mental value, some students point-
ed out its educational value.

“Students can get a feel for
what I mean to not go the corporate
route and not work in a firm, but to
have a real opinion and a real voice
in the system,” said Natalie
D’Amora, a third-year law student.

Not for profit: State shouldn’t
privatize Philly school district

If you are reading this, you’re doing 

better than 87 percent of high school juniors
in the Philadelphia public school system,
according to Gov. Mark Schweiker.

The Washington Post reports that 57
percent of students in the system fail the
state’s basic math and reading tests and 50
percent drop out Schweiker said that only
13 percent of high school juniors can read a
newspaper with adequate comprehension.

Obviously, something needs to be done
to rescue the city’s schools. But the com-
monwealth’s plan to take them over and
place operations in the hands of Edison Inc.,

. a for-proﬁt school management  is not"

the answer.

Under this new plan, the governor will

ﬁre the district’s top 55 administrators and
turn their jobs over to Edison managers.
The company would directly run 60 of the
worst schools —— in conjunction with
church groups, universities, business own-
ers and local politicians.

While a manager may be able to make
the schools ftuiction better ﬁnancially, a
manager’s ability to meet the bottom line
says nothing about how he or she could
improve the quality of a student’s educa-
tion. Parents are already worried that
Edison would cut extracurricular activities,
ﬁne arts and other academic programs if
that meant the difference in making a prof-

IL - - "
Although it is important for a school to
maintain ﬁnancial health, its ﬁrst priority
should be educating its students. That is not
the ﬁrst priority of a for-proﬁt corporation.

This plan also includes $150 million
from the state and city. The state should
instead give the current administration the
chance to improve its services with this sig-
niﬁcant amount of extra money before it
guts the system. As teachers’ union spokes-
woman Barbara Goodman said in the
Washington Post, “If we are going to throw
money around, let’s throw it at programs
that work.”

The state also needs to take a closer
look at why the students are failing and why
so many leave school._ Simply changing the
school’s administration will not do anything
to alleviate deeper problems that affect stu-
dents’ performance, such as poverty and
neighborhood violence.

Hartford, Conn., Minneapolis and
many other cities have already abandoned
failed privatization experiments. Only 28
percent of respondents in a poll by a com-
munity activist group said they supported
the plan, and even Mayor John Street
opposes it.

Yet those pushing the privatization plan
persist. Perhaps they need some = more
schooling themselves.

one election‘ that Ortega won. The election
was for a second term — his ﬁrst began after
he" overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in
the 1979 revolution. . /

According to Malloy, the U.S. Embassy
in Managua attempted to pressure the
observers into saying the election was unfair.
But he and the other observers maintained
that it wasn’t. Notably, there were no such
allegations of _unfaimess in the three elec-
tions Ortega lost. I

' Ortega’s government was known for its
communist leanings, which is why Ronald
Reagan and George H. W. Bush’s adrr1ir1is—
trations opposed him. In fact, the Reagan
administration tried to overthrow him.

But the second Bush administration,
which likes Ortega as much as the ﬁrst did,
found ‘a new label to place on him: “terror-
ist.” It threatened that Nicaragua could
become a target for the war on terrorism if
Ortega was elected. ’ .

Ortega previously had ties with Saddam
Hussein and Libyan leader Col. Mu’armnar
al-Qaddaﬁ‘, both of whom support intema-
tional terrorism. :

He says he’s moderated his stances
since, and the British Broadcasting
Corporation’s Web site (news.bbc.co.uk)

"But Ortega’s softening did not matter to
the State Department. Besides, Bolanos is a
more appealing candidate to our govem—
merit, as he is less threatening to our business
interests in the country.

So our government resorted to calling
Ortega a terrorist. Apparently the name-call-
ing worked. » ‘

Is this a premonition of things to come?
Recently, Sara Jane ' Olson plead guilty to
activities with the Syrnbionese Liberation
Army, the 1970s group most famous for kid-
napping heiress Patricia Hearst. Her reason.

for pleading guilty, although she 
her innocence, is that she felt she could not.-

get a fair trial because of her anti-govem-

ment activities. In other words, a possible

“terrorist’ ’ label could immediately prejudice
the jury against her.

The _sarne logic applies to foreign
affairs. Now, if the American public hears
that a country or a leader supposedly sup-
ports terrorisrri, that country or leader imme-
diately becomes our enemy.

In Ortega’s case, the United States used
a new label to defeat a man it never liked.

_ about Earth is what you see on MTV.

It’s a scary thought, right? If all

Nanc Reddy

Columnist

MTV is representative of the pop
culture wisdom that it doesn’t matter
how smart, talented or hard working
you are, as long as you’re attractive.
The parade of blondes dancing across
your television screen demonstrates
this ugly aspect of pop culture. I

These images are pervasive. It
wouldn’t be fair to say that MTV cre-
ated this culture — but it does have a

rate portrayal of our population.

But the power of image in mass media such
as MTV is astonishing. That power lies in
images that carry subtle messages that most of
us would never agree to in a more explicit form.

Consider this: through the power of video,
MTV has helped make a size 0, blonde 17-year-
old the paradigm of female beauty.

* Think about whom MTV chooses to promote.
The entire boy band craze is in large part the
product of MTV marketing. And if Britney
Spears and Christina Aguilera did not have a

‘whole television channel devoted to constantly

replaying videos of them dancing half-naked, it’s

large part in promoting and maintain-
ing it. .

I focus on MTV for two reasons. First, if it is
in fact music television, then it should focus on
musical talent and not appearance. I can’t help
but think that many talented performers are
probably ignored because they don’t fit the MTV
image. I _

Second, MTV is somewhat unique as a cul-
tural voice for our generation. We are the target
demographic, as well as the target consumers of
the advertisers’ products. If MTV projects an

image that makes young women feel badly about -

themselves, and if they neglect gifted artists
because they don’t fit the right image, then it has

failed us.
MTV is one of the major vehicles of cultural
thought right now, and such it has the potential

-—— if not the responsibility — to do more than

promote boy bands and “House of Style.”

I realize that the entertainment industry is
designed to do just that, entertain. But that does-
n’t mean it can’t inform or educate, or at least
entertain with some measure of intelligence.

Sure, MTV does make sporadic attempts at’

socially responsible programming. But sponsor-
ing Rock the Vote once every four years makes
MTV‘no more socially responsible than attend-
ing People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
charity fundraiser makes Christy Turlington a
dedicated animal rights activist.

MTV has the attention of our generation. If
“TRL” plays a video, it is likely to "become a
radio hit. The clothes that V] s wear are likely to

become popular in high schools across the coun-

try. .
MTV should use its influence positively.
Rather than using the power of images to
endorse a single, nearly unreachable standard, it
should display a more diverse range of voices
and images.

Not all talented performers are cookie-cutter
teeny-boppers. ,. -

Nancy Reddy would love to hear from all you
Britney and Lance fans out there._

Enjoythe silence: the pleasures of introversion

As a freshman, I dated a ‘boy
named Deb who attended another
university. Oncehe came to visit me,

and upon entering the cylindrical _

micro-universe of the 11th floor of
Tower B — home to 40 wild fresh-
man girls who even I didn’t know
very well — Deb found himself with-
out much to say. While he was always
quiet in large groups, it never both-
ered me. ,

After he left, one of the other
girls who lived down the hall com-
mented somewhat distastefully on his
visit, saying that she felt “you could-
n’t really trust those quiet people.”

I don’t think she was alone in this
idea. Ours is a culture largely blind to

the beauties of introversion.

While taking personality tests‘ in
my 11th grade health class, I was
always tempted to lie on the items
that tapped the introversion-extrover-
sion dimension. I wanted desperately
to be rated an extrovert, because the

descriptions of the categories always ‘

made introverts sound so dorky.
Withdrawn. Shy. May feel awkward in
social situations. .
Though the tests always ended up
placing me in the “i”. category -
despite my attempts to the contrary
— I would not use terms like these to

describe my personality.

I am perfectly capable of talking.
Sometimes, I just elect not to.

There are few things I hate more
than stupid conversations, yet our
lives are rife with them. Small talk —.
while fine in moderation — has

become an epidemic. It rears its mon— -

strous head at parties, in classrooms,
in offices, in homes and on the street.
Sometimes it’s pleasant to have a

hi-how~are-you chat with-an acquain- .

tance or old friend with whom you’ve
fallen out of contact. At the risk of
sounding curmudgeonly, I confess
that more often than not, I would
rather remain absorbed in the pleas-
antness of my own thoughts than
engage in babble that is clearly mean-
ingless to both parties. .

So I might put my head down" on
my desk and daydream before class
starts instead of striking up a conver-
sation with the person next to -me. At
a party, I might want to just sit on the
couch and marvel at the drama
around me, rather than actually par-
ticipating in it.

I don’t think there’s anything
wrong with this. Socializing would
be unpleasantly maddening if we
were all loud, vivacious types com-
peting for attention.

Though we’re never the life of
the party, every good social gathering
needs a sprinkling of introverts for
balance and.ﬂavor.,

Quiet does not equal boring.
Often, all introverts need are a

they are and how their day is going. ’
It’s a natural tendency to fill awk-
ward silences with talking. But an
article I recall reading in my
women’s studies reader freshman
year offered some good advice —-
. awkward silences don’t

change of context — while
taciturn at wild shindigs,
we often prove ourselves
to be lovely one-on-one
conversationalists.

Since introverts are not
intent on spewing forth
nonstop chatter, we tend to
be better listeners. The gift
of listening - cannot
be undervalued. My

On various occasions
I have followed this
advice by simply refrain-

men.
Sometimes, they
buckle under the pressure

professor once quoted a

study that found that most people
want good listening more than they

mer is certainly more rare.

There seems to be a demand for
constant conversation in our society,
and furthermore, I think women often
bear the brunt of this pressure.

It’s acceptable for men to be
strong, silent types —— but quiet
women are often perceived as moody
or dull. In groups of strangers or
acquaintances, women often seem to
initiate the chatter, asking men how

. and start asking me about
myself. Other times, we just both
retreat to our own thoughts and savor
the silence.

Like Swedish fish, shots of tequi-
la, Jimmy Buffett and neon’ orange,
talking is enjoyed best in small doses.

Artist Michael Pestel, dressed in black and holding
his ﬂute, steps onto the shallow bed of sand-colored
pebbles that the audience isgathered around. Slowly he
paces to the other side of the rectangular bed, causing a
ripple of bird chirps to rise from speakers placed at each
comer. The audience watches intently, momentarily
turning away to catch a quick glimpse of the nature ﬁlm
projected onto the back wall.

Their attention snaps back as Pestel hastens his
steps, causing the birds’ chirping to intensify and the
ﬂutter of wings to be heard. The birds have ﬂown away.

Pestel halts in the middle of the pebbles and ﬂie
happy chirping resumes. Nonchalantly, he takes his
ﬂute apart, reassembles it, puckers his lips and begins
trilling on the metal mouthpiece, emulating their calls.

VV1th a clang of the gong, the playing stops and
Pestel invites the audience to join him on the pebble
bed .

“Birdscape,” a multimedia installation, is one of
three new exhibits at Carnegie Mellon University’s
ReginaMillerGallery, andtheartistwas onhandfor
this performance at his exhibit’s opening.

The installation by Pestel and Jeroen Van Westen
allows the audience to join in the recreating of extinct
bird songs. The digital detection system under the gar-
den translates footsteps into a measured response in bird
songs, calls and cries of distress.

Simone Jones doesn’t have live perfomiance in her
exhibit, “Displacement,” but it is her philosophy that
sculpture becomes a performer itself.

Her three works — “Chatter,” “House,” and
“Splash” — each have mechanical behaviors.

“Chatter,” a long, thin piece of driftwood suspend-
ed from the ceiling, is attached to the wall by Wires with
miniature hammers on the ends. Each takes its turn

' thumping on the wood creating an orchestra of rhyth-

mic echoes.

The methodical thumping is contrasted against the
naturally soothing sound of waves from “Splash.”

The looping black and white video “Splash” shows
the choppy waves of a lake that are only interrupted by
the sudden splash of a person.

“House” is Jones’ only work without a soundtrack.
A large red house rests on a metal rocker that mechani-
cally pushes it side to side. ‘=

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette photographer William D.
Wade’s black and white photography exhibit doesn’t

“Pittsburgh Spirit” captures the aesthetic of the city

shows Pittsburghers at their strongest and weakest —

determined it was not to be. “Oh

ly majestic song, I still think of that guy and that crazy ‘

night.

schlocky lyrics, their grand glitzy and sugary Swedish pop
occupies a special place in music history, and proves that
our generation was not the first to be bombarded with the
saccharine stylings of a troupe of blonds. To attest to their
popularity, the band has sold more than 300 million
records worldwide, including -20 million copies of ABBA
Gold, the band’s best-of compilation.-

Unfortunately, the syrupy sweet musical coalition of
Benny Andersson, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Frida Lyngstad and
Agnetha Falkskog broke up in the early ‘80s, and ABBA
fanatics — or Abbanatics, as they like to be called — have
been mourning ever since. The band even refused a $1 bil-
lion offer to tour last year.

But guess what — ABBA’s back in 2001 with a

Broadway musical, “Mamma Mia.” The musical, com-
posed by Andersson and Ulvaeus, consists of 22 ABBA
songs that tell the story of a girl on the brink of marriage.

I can only guess that this musical incorporates songs
like “Dancing Queen” and “Waterloo,” in which a woman
compares her marriage to surrendering at the Battle of
Waterloo. Those adorable Swedes chant “Waterloo” over

and over until the word itself starts to sound funny. The-

show’s so light and sweet, The New York Times called it,
“a giant singing Hostess cupcake.” ‘ '

Who doesn’t like snack cakes? ,

Even if you don’t like cream filling, you have to agree
that ABBA‘ is deﬁnitely entertaining. Is it English or
Swedish they’re singing? Aren’t they embarrassed to be
full-grown adults singing those funny songs? And why do
they seemto sing onlyballads?

Who can resist the melodrama of “S.O.S.” or the irre-

sistible self-references when the ABBA girls sing “Thank

You For the Music?” Yes, ABBA wrote a song thanking the
music. Without it, they’re nothing special, but “everyone
listens when [they] start to sing.” _

And everyone will listen to you when you sing ABBA,
too. They may ridicule you and taunt you, but if this hap-
pens, simply remind yourself, “If I had_to do the same
again, I would, my friend, Femando,” ’ '

If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend,
Fernando.

There’s something special about ABBA. Their

When planning theproverbinal heist, it is always"
. important to have the layotrtfthe proper t0olsi§and‘a con;-‘i;

tingency plan. Above all, it is imperative to pick the right
people for the job.

“Heist” playwright and ﬁlmmaker David Marnet’s
latest, follows Joe Moore (Gene Hackrnan), a master
thief who, in the ﬁlm’s opening, is caught on camera for
the ﬁrst time while on the job. After being stiifed for his
and his crew’s share by middleman Bergman (Danny
DeV1to), he is forced to take on yet another heist, this
time with Bergman’s nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam
Rockwell).

Thus begins this convoluted but uncharacteristically
—— for Mamet — conscience-less tale of painﬁrlly
detailed heists, stnmg together by myriad precautions,
cons and backup plans. *

“Heist” follows the recent Hollywood output of

“Bandits” and now.“Heist” are all well—made ﬁlms, but

. ultimately are not the deﬁnitive genre ﬁlms that the col-

lective names attached could or should aspire to be.
What sets “I-Ieist” apart is, of course, Mamet.’s meter
of dialogue, in which every character speaks. in impossi-

," bly witty adages and analogies — and everyone instant-

ly understands what everyone is talking about. It’s a par-
allel universe where no one is out of the loop, with every-
one running around saying, “it’s burnt” or ‘you’re

” or “this place is a bum.” 4

Indeed, “Heist” is an excruciatingly structured tale
of caper and the holy Mamet con. The only problem is,
in being his biggest Hollywood release yet as a director,
Mamet may have picked the wrong guys to carry out the
task -

This is certainly not to say that Hackrnan or DeVito
are not good in the ﬁlm — they’re great. But alongside
Mamet vets like Ricky Jay and Rebecca Pidgeon, who
are accustomed to the notorious “Marnet—speak,” the

ﬁlm isn’t nearly as cohesive character-wise as Mametfs ’

Film al fresco

Telluride Mountainfilm Festival

Sponsored by Outdoors Club
Tomorrow, doors at 7 p.m., films at 7:45 p.m.
Carnegie Lecture Hall

(412) 394-3353

‘ Clare Sierawski is excited. As she jumps out of her seat, her
golden brown, hair bounces when she speaks. With an infectious
smile and a boundless energy, Sierawski solicits the help of her
fellow Outdoors Club members at a recent meeting. Her mission:
fill the volunteer spots for this weekend’s Telluride Mountainﬁlm
Festival.

The Telluride Mountainﬁlm Festival, co—sponsored by the
Western Pennsylvania Field Institute, will present short ﬁlms on
everything from mountain expeditions to environmental docu-
mentaries to cultural proﬁles. The event, held at Carnegie Lecture
Hall tomorrow, hopes to educate and energize Pittsburghers on
issues like exploration-, adventure and preservation. The range of

films will vary and not even the Outdoors Club knows which '

ﬁlms will be shown. _

Energy is the key word here. Sierawski, the fundraising chair
for the Outdoors Club, has a vivacity that bounces off the walls of
the lecture room in Posvar Hall. Standing around a group of
Outdoors Club members, Sierawski yells out to encourage every-
one to volunteer for the ﬁlm festival.

With a bright orange T-shirt and a smile constantly plastered
on her face, Sierawski is hard to miss. As the Outdoors Club meet-
ing ends, she bounds up the steps to catch every single member as
they walk out the door I

“Did you sign up to volunteer yet?” . she asks, cornering a
lanky boy in a sweatshirt. The boy gives her a longing look as if
to say, “I really want to help you out, but I can’t.” One look at
Sieraswki’s determined face changes the boy’s mind. He signs up.

Of course, the members of Outdoors Club are college stu-
dents so when Sierawski promises free cookies, soda, and T-shirts
to festival volunteers, everyone lights up.

‘”l‘wenty—one cases of soda and 42 dozen cookies,” Sierawski
blurts out, hoping to ﬁll her volunteer sheet. ‘

“And sexy T-shirts,” says one boy in the meet;ing’s audience.

‘Everyone laughs. , .

The festival will be a three-hour presentation of short ﬁlms
introduced by Mountainﬁlm Festival Director, Rick Silverman.
Silverman will provide a context in which to place the provoca-

tive and infomiative ﬁlms. In addition to the short ﬁlms, local

outdoor adventure groups will be available to share information
with the festival-fs attendees.

So whether_._you’re an experienced mountain climber or a
novice hiker,  ﬁlmfestival, being viewed for the ﬁrst time in

- Pittsburgh or“i%SatrJrday, is sure .to"‘enlightenv'and energize.

D12     .
With the Kottonmouth Kings,
Bionic Jive and Sunny Ledfurd
Tonight, 7 p.m.
M, $20
(412) 261-2221
Nearly a decade after Run DMC and
Aerosrnith walked their way into the realm
of rap and rock collaborations, who would
have thought hip—hop heads and rock ﬁends
would still be partyingtogether around the
world in 2001? ' .
D12 performs at M this Friday with
Surmy Ledfurd and Bionic Jive, where lyri-

cal rhyme-spitters and mosh-pitting. head-.,

bangers will dwell in alliance.
“Purple Pills,” the ﬁrst single from

.D12’s debut album, Devil is Night, sets the
' controversial tone for this group rising out of

the economically battered streets of Detroit.
Striving to set themselves apart frvomany
other up-and-coming rap group in the indus-
try, D12 successfully creates a media buzz,
and as a result the song’s title has been

_-changed to “Purple Hills” for video purpos-

es ,

7   “Surmy Ledfurd’s music blurs the line of

rap and rock by combining the lyrical tales of

_rnidd1e-class Gastonia, N.C., with cranked-

up dirty south beats with hard rock choruses.
Surmy Ledfurd’s debut album, The
White Disk, is an eclectic mix of radio-
friendly songs from a musically and ethni-
cally diverse band. The band’s members
consist of two ethnic Albanians, one
Albanian American, an East Indian
American, and a North American. In
“Scenario” and “Pimpin Ain’t Easy," the
group’s rap and rock inﬂuences, ranging
from Snoop Dog and Tupac to Gun’s N’
Roses to Sublime, become apparent.
Amzageddon Through Your Speaker,
Bionic Jive’s debut album, features two rap
MCs accented by a live heavy rock band.
Bionic Jive delivers to rap-rock fans that
enjoy pimp and bravado—praising lyrics
accompanied by hype beats in songs like“
Hands to the Roof’ and “Shut ‘Em Down.”
The band lyrically uplifts listeners’ political
and social consciences on “I Shot.Lucifer”

and “Ricochet,” as well as recognizing mosh 1 1

culture in “Swarm.” _

Whether you are a rap or rock fan, or a
connoisseur of both of these genres, you will
deﬁnitely leave this concert satisﬁed with the
range of D-12, Kottonmouth Kings, ‘Bionic
Jive and Surmy-Ledfurd’s talent.

isponrs VIEW
Kevin Nash

Super Bowl champion Baltimore
Ravens escaped a defeat by the

Steelers Sunday. Most people blame

Steelers’ place-kicker ‘Kris Brown’s
nightmare performance for the loss.
.Yes, he missed four field goals,

but you have credit the Ravens for get-

ting inside his head. L

Ravens cornerback Chris
McAlister blocked Brown’s first field
goal of the third quarter and rolled
over on his leg. After that Brown was
not even close on any of his remaining
kicks, which _ included a 35-yard
attempt to send -__the game into over-
time.  ' “ — J v

It doesn’t matter anyway because
the Steelers are not my pick to ‘win this
season. I have to stick with the Ravens
winning the AFC, Central.

The‘ Steelersplay a softer schedule
than the Ravens for the rest of the sea-
son, but the Ravens will be victorious
in the rematch, which will give them
the AFC Central title as long as things
go well. " _

The Steelers have to go to PSINet

Steelers also have ' to get past
Jacksonville on Sunday, who beat
them in the first game of the season

134 yards_ and a touchdown. Engish did not play against Rutgers last’ season because of a knee injury. J

Pitt takes win streak to Rutgers

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

What a difference three weeks
‘makes.
Pitt, a team mired in turmoil and
question marks just 20 days ago, is
now a team with a two-game winning
streak under its belt and the possibil-
ity of a bowl bid still alive.
' Rutgers (2-6 overall, 0-5 in the
Big East), unlike Pitt, has seen no
change in its fortune. The team is still
searching for its first conference win
of the season and comes off a brutal
80-7 blowout last week at the hands
of West Virginia. * I
Pitt is one week removed" from its
-38-7 squashing of then N o. 12-ranked
Virginia Tech Hokies. According to
head coach Walt Harris, it was the
first game that Pitt finished com-
pletely as the defense and offense
both played solidly for four quarters.

One of the main reasons for Pitt’s -

. . , V — A . , - . . .

- . , . , . , . . , » . , _.

turnaround is the play of David
Priestley.

In the three games previous to the
winning streak against Notre Dame,
Syracuse and Boston College,
Priestley threw for 379 yards, _ a
touchdown and six interceptions. .In
his most recent two games, he threw
for 449 yards, five touchdowns and

-no interceptions. ‘
Rutgers’ quarterback Ryan Cubit,

has not fared as well. Cubit, a fresh-
man, has been intercepted 17 times
this season, while throwing just eight
touchdown passes. Last week he was
battered by the West Virginia
defense, completing four of 14 pass-
es, for a miniscule 27 yards and four
interceptions. .

This week Cubit faces a Pitt
defense that has dominated Temple
and Virginia Tech’s offenses over the
past two weeks.

Pitt’s secondary intercepted
Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Noel

twice last weekend, which included
one by Shawntae Spencer that was
returned" 68 yards for a touchdown.
Torrie Cox also picked off Noel last
week. "

-Pitt’s defense held Temple to neg-

- ative 36 net rushing yards two weeks
ago. Last weekend it stiﬂed Virginia.

Tech’s tandem of Keith Burnell and
Kevin Jones for 25 yards on 15 car-
ries.

This will provide an interesting
contrastas the Rutgers’ offense runs
the ball often. Rutgers ran the ball 57
times last week against West
Virginia, with senior tailback Marcus

Jones getting the majority of the car-

ries. .
Pitt featured a -mt..- Jalanced

Pitt ruggers end fall season with optimism

CONNOR FLAHERTY
The Pitt News

With many Pitt teams perform-
ing poorly this the fall, the Pitt
rugby football club has improved
and reached the playoffs.

Pitt Rugby Football Club is that
team. 6 ‘ 4

While compiling a 5-1 regular
season record, which included a 25-
21 victory over rival West Virginia
University, the Pitt Ruggers contin-
ued, their torrid pace of success last
weekend, when they participated in
the Midwest Conference playoffs in
Bowling Green, Ohio.

Although the team dropped
games against Marshall and Central
Michigan, ending their season, the
Pitt RFC _shouldn’t feel disheart-
ened, according to head coach Dan

_ Talbert.

_Ta1bert attributed much of the
team’s success to an outstanding
rookie class that “brought a lot of
fire and attitude with them.”

The loss to Clarion midway
through’ the season provided the
spark the Pitt Ruggers needed to
make the necessary adjustments
needed to essentially dominate the
opposition for the rest of the sea-
son.

“There was no fire there,”
Talbert said of the Clarion match.
“Clarion definitely wanted it more
than we did.”

They turned the season around
after the Clarion game with the
domination of rival West Virginia
the next week, in a matchup that
wasn’t nearly as close as the score
indicates. _',

Further showing its discipline
and change of attitude, Pitt manhan—
dled John Carroll University in a
56-0 blowout.

While praising the entire team,
Talbert specifically mentioned the
efforts of three players and their
contributions. to this season’s cam-
paign. James Szatala, Todd
Shimshock and Brian Dick were all
described \as major contributors to
the team’s cohesion and success.

“James hasreally been leading
the team on the field,” Talbert said.
“He’s done a great job of keeping
the forwards together.”

“Every time Shimshock gets the

-ball he does great things,” he said.

Talbert described Dick as a
player who has become “very ﬂuid
with the ball as well as being able
to read defenses.” .

Talbert stated that this team now
has more depth than any team that

   

     
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

he has coached before.

“We have the talent right now to
beat anybody in the neighborhood,”
he said. _

A great contributor to the for-
wards’ success has been the addi-
tion of coach Shawn _Crago.

A teammate and friend of
Talbert’s, Crago did an exceptional
job with the pack in helping them
fortify their rucks, which is when
teammates keep the opponent from
reaching the ball by bending over a
tackled teammate, thus shielding
the ball so another teammate can
grab it. -

“Our pack is doing really well,”

Talbert said. “Shawn’s done a great
job. These kids can ruck with any-
one.” ,.

The young. team fought hard in
the playoffs but despite the players’
efforts, they dropped games to
nationally ranked Marshall, by the
score of 35-14 and to Central

' Michigan, by the score of 31-26.

“We hung with them, but the
executions of our.decisions didn’t

work well,” Talbert said regarding -

the Marshall matchup.

Talbert continued describing the
Central Michigan squad as “the
largest college team I’ve ever
seen.” With props at 6 feet 2 inches

and 300 pounds, size was undoubt-
edly to CMU’s advantage. ,
Losing two key players in Jeff
Shellenberger and Shimshock to
injuries during the CMU game, did-
n’t help matters for Pitt.
Nonetheless, both of these loss-
es came against either a conference
winner or a nationally ranked team.
Despite these shortcomings of the
weekend, Pitt proved that it can
hang with the top teams on the East
Coast.
Although the fall season has
ended, the team will have the
opportunity to capitalize on its suc-
cessful season and advancement
,when play resumes in the spring.
“To advance to the Final Four in
the Midwest is our goal right now.
If all of these kids stick around, we
could be a national contender,”
Talbert said of the upcoming spring
season. ,
There will "be no rest for the
’ weary, as the Pitt RFC will resume
conditioning for the spring season
at the Cost Center in January.
The team never hesitates in
bringing on new players and anyone
‘who wants to be a part the club.
Talbert said that all someone needs
to do is to show up with enthusiasm
and a desire to learn and compete.

Betterpass defense can lift Ravens to the top

Celumn, page 13

last season. Last October the Ravens
went the entire month without scoring
a touchdown. The games were in the
hands of the defense and place—kicker
Matt Stover.

This year in October the Ravens
lost to Green Bay and Cleveland. In
both games, turnovers were a factor
and the defense was not able to put‘ up
the performance that the league is used
to seeing. It gave up 31 points to the
Packers and 24 points to the Browns.

What are these teams doing that
they were not doing last year?

Teams are passing on first down
because defensive tackles Tony
Siragusa and Sam Adams are in the
game and it proved last year to be very
difficult to run with them in the game.

Teams discovered this year that it
is easier to pass against the Ravens’
defense and they are doing so with
confidence. Adams and Siragusa
weigh nearly 700 pounds combined
and in order to move them it takes sev-
eral offensive linemen. This leaves
Ray Lewis, the NFL’s best linebacker,
unblocked and Lewis makes a lot of
the tackles.

Now that teams are passing as

opposed toirunning on first down, this
allows quarterbacks to sit in the pock-
et longer than usual and look for an
open receiver because of the lack of
pressure.

Quarterbacks such as Brett Favre

and Mark Brunell exploit this mis-.

match for major yardage. The Ravens
were able to comeback and win against
Brunell and the Jaguars, but were not
so lucky against Favre and the Packers.

The Ravens need to find a way to
solve this problem of being ineffective
in defending’ against the passion first
down and I’rn confident that defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis will figure

out a scheme to solve this issue.

Look for the Ravens to be in a
rematch of last year’s AFC champi-
onship game with -the Oakland

F-Raiders, who appear to be running

away with the AFC West again this
year. After soundly beating the Denver

Broncos on Monday night, San Diego

is their closest competition in the, divi-
sion. It is unlikely that the Chargers
will be able to keep up with the
Raiders.

Providing that the Ravens defense
gets around this problem of defending
against first down passing and quarter-
back Elvis Grbac gets back on track,
the Ravens should be repeat AFC
champions. .

Grbac has had an interception“

problem this season — in each game
that the Ravens lost, turnovers were
the main problem. .

If the Ravens don’t solve this prob-
lem then my pick is Rich Gannon and
the Raiders. The Raiders will eat the
Ravens defense alive with the threat of

Gannon, Jerry Rice and Tim Brown if '

this problem is not solved.

My pick for the NFC is the St.
Louis Rams if they can shake their los-
ing streak against New Orleans.

If they can’t, the NFC is wide

‘open, but I will humor you and pick

another team. My alternate pick is the
Green Bay Packers because the Bears
are not for real. They have been losing
games and have received big breaks in
back-toiback weeks against the 49ers
and Browns, which are teams Green
Bay would handle easily.

Only time will" tell when the Bears
face Green Bay this Sunday and
Tampa Bay the week after. '

The ideal Super Bowl would be the '

Ravens defense, up to par,’ against the
Rams. If the Ravens get back to this
level of play it will make for an enter-
taining Super Bowl. '
