Agree With Roosevelt

'Somefhing. '.

Should Be Done To Allow Progress,ive~»
Legislation." Buf Nof Amendme'n‘f'

By CLARENCE WIBLE

Three University professors got to-
gether on the ﬁuprern .CQurt,ques-
tion last weekend‘ 0 cred" up their
opinions to a p_uzzled,1,'eport.e1'. .V ir-
tually, they became ‘witnesses for the
defense of President.Roosevelt’s re-
organization plan. 1

“Something should. be done to, al-
low progressive legislation,” the three
teacliers ‘agree. 1)r. "Francis Tyson,
professor of economics, however, does
not think that the result will be a
constitutional amendment. "

Both Jacob Blair, instructor in eco-
nomics, and Dr. Marion McKay, pro-
fessor of economics, are inclined to
agree that the recent progressive
trend in the Court may lessen the de-
mands for “packing.” Dr. McKay
says: “The Court has ﬁnally taken
cognizance of progressive economic
trends. Undoubtedly, adverse criti-
cism has inﬂuenced them.”

Blair thinks that Chief Justice

Hughes has had a great deal to do‘

with the swing to the left. “lluglics

court being undermined by adverse
5 n -
criticism, and brought Roberts over

. rests on how long Roberts stays with
lHughes," says Blaiix, '

‘All three consider Mr. Roosevelt
sincere. “The I‘i'esidcnt,” says In-
structor Blair, “naturally wants the
court to be in s_vinpa.t.hy with his
policies.” Dr. McKay admires the
president, for his siiiccrity, holding
that “If I were a coiigrcssinaii, 1
would probably-sec eye to eye with
him. However, as an impartial ob-
server I am not quite so certain about
evei:yt_hing, _connected with this Su-
preme Coui't~revision.” ~ -

seems necessary "to Dr; i_'l‘yson.‘Hc
say: “We must follow the President.”
However, ‘Dr; Tyson feels» that per-

out.
The reporter is still puzzled.

The Cathedral of Learning is rapid-

attractions for visitors in the city,
according to ‘reports from the Eve-
ning Session office where visitors’
permits are issued.

‘More than 500 people were shown
‘through the Cathedral on one af-
ternoon alone, it was estimated. The
a*.s'erage number of visitors going
through the building is about 100 at
this time of the year. Even greater
crowds are expected after June 1
when the Commons Room will be ﬁn-
ished.

People from all walks of life are
represented in those who inspect the
building. At the present time most

of the visitors are high school stu-

dents. During the summer however,
vacationists from throughout the
country will make up the niajority of
the visitors.

The tour of inspection includes a
trip to the 36th floor for the panor-
ama view of the city, and stops in the
library and the Commons Room.

its way to favor first because Carl Cass and
his Cast jammed the lines and pantomime chuck
full of “Casey At The Bat” punch. The show had
punch, plenty of it.
True, except for “Madeline” Robert Graf, the
femmes were not up to that Russ Connolly glam-‘
our and allure of an earlier vintage. Even Graf

was shades short of the real Connolly, but. he’s.

young yet‘ with three more years to go. We don’t
think we’ll forget Spanky Barr's happy rotun-
dity, nor his pleasant faculty of making every
scene “right at home,” nor his contagious hu-
mour. We won’t forget two freshmen, who", with
Graf, merely continue the freshman precedent of
stealing big slices of the show. Karl Stark in a
little Lord Fauntelroy get-up and with a low-
Bronx-accented phraseology, has the best lines of
the show and smacks every one of those groove
balls right square on the nose for an extra-base hit
in each successive trip to the plate. Jack Hoeve-
ler talks his part into the show and perhaps shows
more native ability in his imitations and come-
easy mannerisms than any of the many who take
their cues. and make their exits. This lad is
stamped with Big-Time qualities.

Shades 0! The Sandals ,
TEIAT Ray Bolgcr take-off by Sid Shore and

“Calculus Professor” Bill Murray, Pitt News
copy readers de-luxe, is a "wow.” The arms had
a long ways to go for Bolger “flow,” but they
weren’t short on any other score. Their act was

much too shortiand came late, contributing to the '

whirlwind ﬁnish.

_ Floyd Nicklas as Papaloopolis earns a check-
plus for his expert handling of dialect and his
polished stage presence. Boyish-bobbed Jim
Lalor, the lady in purple in the dance-team num-
ber close to the ﬁnale, twists and slides in and
out of the arms of her partner with truly femin-
ine ease. John Werry, Johnstown transfer, and
another ﬁrst-year man in the show, is tops, both
in some six-and-a-half feet of space and in his
vocal love calls. He’s Ohkey. . .

Oh they’re all good, and even a bit risque, hot
dog! You even like Freshman Cavalier’s (second
lady from the right in the chorus) over-exuber-
ance. You don’t want the chorus to be the ac-
cepted perfection of timing, coordination, and

mass effect. You want the goils and guysto be

individuals, to stand out. The Pitt cap and gown
chorus girl is different, individual, and very much
alive when she kicks out of time, or trucks much
too much. Cavalier should take good care of
Baskin’s chorustic antics to lead many choruses
in the next few years. .

Then, you know, there’s the girl in the tennis
outﬁt who is dressed too perfectly to fit the occa-
sion. And a Kelly person who does a mean act
on roller skates, but who later, spends too much
time in the Wylie Avenue scene. But pcrhap
he’s too good for the show, you think. ~

G001] Stuff, All 0i It . . . _
SPANOS-SAFFRON, a-la-Com-m‘-u-nist, give

their own version of a couple of wandering"

soap-boxers. Thcy’re hot, red hot, like Saffron’s
night shirt.

The football scene was just what the person
who knows little about the real calibre of a Pitt
football player wanted to see. We know! It was
satire. . . But it’s about time the satirists satire
the person who demands that the Pitt fectsball
man be satircd to that person’s satisfaction. Or
sumpin’. . .

That third act night-club scene caught a few
gasps of surprise from the student circles. Mr.
Kelly uncovered no Fred Astaires outside of the
Kelly family, but the dancing had a genteel good-
ness about it. _

There was only one casualty on our night out.
but that was covered up admirably by “Doc”
Spanky Barr, Prof. Bill Murray and The College
Widow. It was a love scuffle, the inevitable tri-
angle scene, that scnt Spanky to the ﬂoor in true
script fashion, but the disengagement of the cubic
one’s wig insured a vigorous, if not realistic,
stage version of the incident. But we like those
things.

15,000 Cheer

ALL IN ALL, the show had a goodness, we re-

peat, that covered each evening’s run like a
P. T. Barnum tent. Some believe that the high
standard established at last year’s “Out For The
Count” brought back the customer’s for this
year opus. At any rate, the show was good for
9,300 in six nights at the Nixon, better than 3.000
at the Syria Mosque opening, and at least that
many on the road at Bradford and at Eric. Some
ﬁfteen thousands viewed the -initial attempt of
that new Cass-Kelly combination; and they pro-
nounced it most satisfactory from the stand-point
of good entertainment. More students ﬁled into
the Nixon than ever before. In terms of capacity
audiences, it is reported that Wednesday. Friday,
and Saturday saw the boys packing the first
floor and balcony to capacity, while on the re-
maining nights, they were good for 90 percent.
The show has been judged the most successful,
ﬁnancially, since 1930. Seven years is a long time,
and ‘it is hoped that the show stays at its present
success peak in the years to come.

Cap and Gown is one of the top events in the
extracurricular program. It has all the thrills
and levity of undergraduate life, and vitality
foams up beer-like in every student from the
first- to last- nighter, and we think, “It’s a good
thing.” And we like it. . .

Political Whirl

By William Stark

Harlan County, Kentucky

Since 1923, with the famous March on Rome of Mus-

solini, and more recently, in 1933, with the ascension
of Adolph Hitler, America has been appreciative of her
democratic institutions, and praising the high heavens
that she knew no such catastrophes. With her head bur-
ied in the sands of depression, and with one eye cooked
on Europe America has failed to appreciate Hitleristic
tactics within herown boundaries.
‘ In Harlan ‘County, Kentucky, Hitler and Mussolini
could learn much. "Even the most fundamental rights of
American citizens have been unscrupulously tampered
with. Men have been shot to death for attempting to
better their economic conditions through recognized
legal channels. , . '

Fundamental rights of free speech ‘and free assembly
have been trampled. Sherilfs and ‘their deputies have

shot down innocent men, and _why? Because certain
m1ners have attempted to organize into unions.

Harlan County is the home of the 1arg_es_t non.-union
mines and one of the few unorganized mining dlstrlcts

' in the country. There can be nothing wrong with the

United Mine Workers Union if 500,000 men voluntarily
consent to join it in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohlo,
and elsewhere. There can be nothing wrong with the
organization if such states allow organization without
intimidation. _ S

But, there is certainly something wrong with Ken-
tucky when authorized State officials are allowed to
tamper with the lives and property of thousands of citi-
zens, and use State funds to perpetrate their dictatorial
movements.

It is a tribute to Senatior l.:aFollctte and his Senate
Civil Liberties Committee that tlioy have begun to in-
vestigate such feudalism with the aim and purpose of
putting an end to such things. Gradually, we hope, Amer-
ica’s lethargic attitude toward such conditions will be
changed to one of active defense of constitutionally-
guaranteed rights. Otherwise, our democracy is lost.

The Presidential Reel

We some times wonder what will happen if the coun-
try is someday blessed with a president who distinctly
dislikes ﬁshing. Things will soon reach the place where
a deﬁnite criterion as to the ﬁtness of presidential can-
dida'tes will be their skill with the rod and the line. This
situation becomes more acute when reporters complain
that the President ﬁles his “copy” late, and that it con-
tains little news, after he elects to “cover” himself for
the papers. “Every one in ﬁne spirits,” and “caught a
90—pounder" seem to have replaced. as “ﬁller.” such old
standbys as ‘‘I do not choose to run,” and “Rappahanock
Falls is unusually good.”

S000!’ I

_ 0UR admiration goes out to station WLS, Chi-

cago, for scoring what must have been the
greatest news scoop in the whole history of jour-
nalism. WLS had two announcers at the landing
ﬁeld at Lakchurst Thursday evening to record
the landing of the “Hindenburg” on the ﬁrst an-
niversary of Transatlantic Air Travel.

We can still remember a thrill of horror when
announcer Morrison interrupted his rather pro-
saic description of “the big bird floating toward
its roost on the mooring mast" to exclaim “It’s
caught fire! It’s burning up!”

That Morrison almost immediately became hys-
terical, and botched up the rest of the broadcast
in a mess of tears, gasps, and chokes stamps him
as no less human than the rest of us. But from
now on, when we think of a big news story break-
ing suddenly, like a shoelace, we’l1 think of an-
nouncer Morrison and station WLS.

(line For The Kid Sister

It's family week at the Penn. “The
Prince and the Pauper" is the sort
of picture you can take your kid sis-
ter or any member of Men's Council
to see without worries about their
asking any pointed and embarrassing
questions. It’s a good clean picture
and I liked it.

The ﬁlm was adopted from Mark
Twain's “story of once upon a time
that could have happened.” It is sim-
ple and sweet and bears not the slight-
est taint of love interest. passion, or
lust. One of the Mauch twins, (Billy
or Bobby, I’m not sure which) plays
the role of Edward the VI, heir ap-
parent. to the throne of Henry the
VIII. The other twin is cast as Tom
Canty, a beggar boy. Claude Rains
is the ‘bad guy’ and Errol Flynn,
who’s swinging a pretty mean piece
of steel pretty nearly all the time, is
the ‘good guy.’

lie Fetches The Dog
Everything revolves about the fact
that Edward the VI and Tom Canty
are as much alike as the minds of
two Phi Gams. Fate. Kismet. Destiny
or what have you brings these two
kids together on the night when

- Henry is about ready to do a fadeout.

They exchange clothes during the
routine of a game. When Edward,
dressed in Tom’s clothes, leaves the
room to go fetch his dog, he is mis-
taken ‘for Tom by’ the unfriendly
Captain of the Guard and run out
of the castle.

In the meantime Claude Rains has
been slinking all over the place in
the manner of a campus politician
and worrying as ‘to how he is going
to become. the English equivalent of
what on campus is known as Chair-
man of the Executixre Committee of
SFA. Claude is in pretty much of a.
stew because he realizes that Edward,
being the normal boy that he .is, has
the 11o1""i:'vl rm.°_son’s dislike for the
politician. Consequently he is happy
to learn secretly, of course, that Tom
and Edward have changed places. He
ﬁnds Tom ignorant; uses him to gain
his ends;land sends men out to get
rid of Edward.

It is at this point that Errol Flynn,
a swashbuckling cutie with a sword,
steps in and saves the day for Eng-
land, the ‘crown, Edward, Tom and
all other interested parties. In the
end, after, many thrilling adventures,
of course, everyone, even Claude
Rains, is happy and Errol Flynn is
staging a sit down. You see, his grate-
ful king had awarded him the right
to sit when the king sat.

There Airs’: No Justice

Maybe you haven’t noticed it but
the lnakers of “Mountain, Justice,”
now running a little wild at the Stan-
ley, aren’t proud. They make all kinds
of pictures. Even not so good ones.
Anyway they made “Mountain Jus-
tice” which if taken literally is no
mean task.

Here is a picture which may rouse
the brute in you and then again it
may not. The picture (I am not to be
taken literally) is laid somewhere in
the Ozarks. That is most of the pic-
ture is laid there. It, of course, has
some bigger moments when it is laid
in New York. The plot—-—-or what we
for the sake of clarity shall call a
plot--is thin, very thin, as thin as
the hair on Car] Cass’s head. It is
spun around the fact that Josephine
Hutchison, female lead, is big-hearted,
generous and ‘broad-minded. Joseph-
ine, or rather the character Josephine
portrays. likes people and she wants
to help them. Unfortunately, Joseph-
ine’s father is a little bitter against
the world and he doesn't like people;
so he shoots ‘them. And ﬁnally just
to make everything more complex
and complicated George Brent likes
Josephine, which puts matters. in a
pretty pickle.

llillbilly Vs. Slieker

In case you don't follow me, I'll
elucidate or something. Josephine is
a hillbilly and her father is a hill-
billy. Brent, on the other hand is a
slick lawyer with a slick mustache
from that slick Big Town called New
York. The hillbillies look on him as
a “furriner,” and they are right. . .
George adds injury to the insult of
his appearance by ﬁrst ﬂirting with
Josephine and then by sending her
father to jail for murder.

It was during the first trial se-
quence that I noticed one of the ﬁlm's
delightful eccentricities which some
others may call weaknesses or even
inconsistencies. Mr. Brent is a New
York lawyer and yet he is found
prosecuting a case in the Ozarks. It
must have been at least a surprise to
the local District Attorney. But that,
just like most of “Mountain Justice,”
is beside the point. The point was
that George wanted to marry Joseph-
ine and Josephine wanted to build a
clinic.

“Don’t you understand?” she asks.

“Darling," he answers, “all 1 un-
derstand is that we love each other.”
Somebody said Dorothy Parker wrote.
this refreshing bit of dialogue but
don’t you believe it. She didn’t. Well.
to make a too long picture short.
what ﬁnally happens is this: Jo.’s pa
horsewhips Jo., Jo. kills her pa, Jo.
goes to jail, Jo. gets out of jail, Jo.
marries George. Finish.

The stage show is a treat after the
picture. Guy Lombardo plays “the
sweetest music this side of heaven”
and Rufe Davis doe:-: imitations that
are new and novel. Rufe’s iinitations
range from spinning airplane:-' to
barnyard ﬁghts. Also on the program
is a young: dance team that rated an
encore or two, at least.

By MILTON LEHMAN

(Editor's Note: This is the sixth in I series of articles dealing with the
mechanics and composition of the Cathedral Library.)

 

WE spoke to Miss Ellen Page, librarian in charge of the All-
dred Room on the sixth floor, Cathedral, and, subsequently,

we wrote an article.

Miss Page didn’t like the article. “No, you journalists are too
busy. You know. this is a. browsing room. You can't pound out

an article in ten minutes on a

browsing room. Now why don’t

you take a few minutes and look around. You’ve got to get the

flavor of the place.”

We took a few minutes and we got
the ﬂavor. “Browsin‘g”—that’s the
spirit of the room. Soft luxurious
chairs, handsome mahogany tables,
and plenty of light from the wide
windows that surround the room help
to provide the ﬂavor.

Then we inspected the books—the
actual raison d’etre for the Alldred
Room. The range encompasses prac-
tically everything. There is one vol-
ume of life photographs that is a bet-
ter compilation of pictures than we
have seen in a long time. There are
a number of ﬁrst editions, many fine
leather bound sets, one volume auto-
graphed by Mark Twain’.

Of the natureof the volumes, we
found classics stacked ‘next door to
popular current novels, recent books
of philosophy next to volumes of poe-
try. The variety, no doubt, encourages
the sort of freedom book browsers
want.

From Miss Page we learned‘ that
there are well over’ 3,000 volumes
kept in the room,_,'with some 7,000
books in the stacks on the fourth
floor, all belonging to the Alldred
collection. Theﬂbooks in the stacks
are continually interchanged with
those in the Alldred Room to retain
a freshness and variety in the collec-
tion.  _ .
The history of the Alldred Room
goes back to Peter, Alldred, in whose
honor the room was given to the Uni-
versity. Mr. Alldred, who lived from
1847 to 1907 on the South Side, sold
wholesale drugs, and took pleasure in
the collection of line books.

His collection was given to the Uni-
versity in 1907 by his brother, John
Alldred, and his sisters, Mrs. Emma
Alldred Trautman and Miss Mary
Jane Alldred, with ‘the -stipulation
that the collection be segregated and
kept intact as a separate collection
to be known as the Peter Alldred Li-
brary. The development of the library-
had been assured by an endowment
fund established by the late John
Alldred.

The volumes in the collection are
arranged around the room according

Field Weakness Crops 
Up_Again To Cause l
Panther Defeat

After two undefeated teams have
come together there is only one. Af-
ter Saturday’s track meet at State
College-between the unbeaten cinder
outﬁts of Penn State and Pitt, only
the Lions remain inthe unconquered
class. Because the weight events bore
so much weight in balancing the

Penn State defeated Pitt for the ﬁrst
time in four years, 74-61.

Johnny Woodruff, Pitt’s giant-step-
ping Olympian,‘outstrode the entire
field when he helped himself to three
first places and helped the Panthers
to a "deﬁnite superiority in the run-
ning events. Five firsts and a tie for
another on thecinders enabled Pitt
to 'out"score the Nittany lads,‘ 45-27,
in'this' phase of the meet. _

But, the track races were only half
of it. The other half was in the ﬁeld,
and this type of compeition belonged
entirely to the Lions. They won
every event exceptthe javelin, scor-
ing sweepers in the discus and ham-
mer, and a one-two in the shot put.
With this display of -point gather-
ing, Penn State outscored the Olsen-
men, p 47-16.

THREE FAST RACES

Individual ‘ supremacy went to
world’s longest, striding trackman,
Woodruﬂ’. The Pitt sophomore won
the 440, 880, and mile run. Each one
of these trictories was characterized
by exceptional time.

Woodruff is a runner, not unlike
other track performers, ‘who paces
himself only V as . fastﬂas his opposition
requires. In winning the quarter mile,
he was pushed by his teammate, Art
Thomas, who finished second. Wood-
rufl”s time was 48.2 seconds.

Matched with Pete Olexy, Stat-e’s
great distance runner and one of the
nation’s best cross country runners,
Woodruff turned in the best time he
has made in the mile run this year,
4:20*.9. This is’ still a long way from
the 4 minute mile that he is being
built up to, bu-t it represents another
lap in- the direction of that goal.
Woodrufl ended up 15 yards ahead
of Olexy. '

REDMOND STARS

Jim Redmond, Penn State's Penn
Relay point winner, was second to
Woodruff in the scoring. He out-
jumped Pete Bennett in the high
jump with a leap that lifted him 6
feet, 13/4 inches above the turf. He
beat Routch in the broad jump and
finished third in the high hurdles.

Dave Bauer, Nittany liurdler,
bested Kenny Ryden, making it the
ﬁrst time this year the Pitt sopho-
more has not had the hurdle, winning
to himself in dual competition. Bauer
and Rydcn ran a dead heat in the
high hurdles in a time of 15.1 sec-
onds. Bauer beat Itydcn to the tape
in the 220-yard lows. The winning
time in this race was 24.1. Ryden
was bothered by a strained muscle,
sustained in the Notre Dame meet.

Dick Mason, IC4A sprint champion
who has been hindered by injuries
all year, reached his season’s health-
iest condition and his best running
form Saturday. He won both daslies.
In the century, his time was 10 flat.
His best race was in the 220-yard
dash where teammate Thomas again
was instrumental in exerting a fast
time out of someone else. Mason won
in 21.4 seconds. Glenn Cooper was
second in the 100. ‘

Gene Taano scored Pitt’s only ﬁeld
win with a 182 foot heave in the
javelin. Penn State records were
broken by Penn State performers.
Redmond’s high jump set a new
mark and Bob Clarke went up to 13
feet, 1 inch in the pole vault.

Pitt’s freshmanitrack team defeated
the Lion Cubs, 74-61.

According to the daily journals,
the Penn State victory was unex-
pected. “Penn State's . . . track team
pulled a major upset by topping a
high rated Pittsburgh squad,” said
one national new service story.
“Penn State's undefeated track team
scored an upset victory over Pitt,”
read another syndicated article.

According to Pitt News calcula-
tions made last Friday, Penn State
was a definite favorite. In the way
of prognostication, the News has ﬁg-
ured beforehand every Pitt meet thus
far to a degree that only differed
from the ﬁnal score by a few points.

LYMPIC champion, who did as

much in» the way of running
Saturday afternoon in War Ad-

measures somewhere between nine
and twelve feet when it is
stretched out in full racing power.
He has a running form that re-
sembles a Kentucky Derby winner
going around the track. His speed
is likewise comparable to a race
horse.‘ Saturday, against Penn

Penn Hand Panthers
First Defeats

Bunkercd for the first time this
year, the Pitt golf team dropped
three matches over the weekend at
the Kenwood Country Club, Wash
inglon, D. C., and with them dropped
out of the cliaiiipionsliip running of
the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf A..-
sociat-ion.

Playing golf that was not up
to their own standard of par, the
Panther putters were styinied by
Georgetown on Friday, 6-3, and by
Princeton, 8-1, and Pennsylvania, 6-3,
in Satur(lay’s conference play. Con-
fronted by a poorly-conditioned
course, the Pitt team just couldn't
play the kind of golf it has shown
itself capable of in previous matches
this season.

Tony Kay, all season the Pan-
thcr’.< best plzrvvr. was the top Pitt
man in the xvoek-eiid's competition.
lie won two out of three matches.
He defeated Busby of Princeton, 1
up, and Moore of Pennsylvania, 5
and 3. Bob Baughman, Pitt’s veteran
senior, coiitributed another point to
the meager Pitt total by stroking
out a well-played medal of 76 and
winning his match with Donahue of
Georgetown, 6 and 4.

REPEATS 1 936 FIASCO

The Panthers received similar
treatment in their matches last year
in Washington, but this year's squad,
showing signs of exceptional talent,
was expected to make a strong bid
for the title. Sophomore inexperience
may have been at determining point
in the Pitt defeat. Four of the team’s
players are playing their first year
in this competition. '

Frank Soucliak, Pitt’s number one
man, went through the Assoc.iatien’s
matches last year without losing a
point, but was unable to duplicate
that again. Generally accepted as the
prime reason for Pitt’s poor showing
was the fact that the team just had
an “off day.” This incontrollable in-
consistency has been the bugaboo of
many seasoned tournament players
in important matches.

Not Games

As one feature of the WAA spring
sports schedule, a series of tennis
matches between an all-University
team for women and teams of other
colleges in the Pittsburgh district
has been scheduled by Francis Grimes,
Ed'o'7, tennis manager of WAA.

The ﬁrst of these matches will be
played tomorrow afternoon with P.-
C.W. on Trees courts. Games slated
for next week include sets with Mt.
Mercy on Tuesday and with Duquesne
on Wednesday. Matches with Carnegie
Tech have not yet been scheduled.

As a result of the large number
of entries for positions on the wom-
en's all-University team, ﬁnal selec-
tions have not been made. Miss
Grimes will announce the team to
play in tomorrow's matches this af-
ternoon.

In the meantime, ﬁrst round
matches for the women's intramural
tournament, which were paired off a
couple of weeks age, must be played
this week, if possible.

Some 1,000 fans and coaches
climbed into the soutliwcst stands
in ‘the Pitt stadium Saturday after-
noon to help Dr. Sutherland nail
down the lid on the 1937 spring
training L-'P«',i,»?Ol1.

Oﬁ‘icially. Dr. Sutherland is there-
by scheduled to forget all about
football, but actually his troubles
have only begun. The current crop.
while perhaps possessing better
background than any in recent
years, still has a long ways to go
before it will even come close to
the peak it reached for its Rose
Bowl triumph over the Washington
Huskies last New ’).'e.ar’s afternoon.

Coach Sutherland since has lost
his right hand man. Bill Kern, and
also Eddie Baker, seine shucks of
a quarter back coach and scout. who
have teamed up to improve the Tech
situation. Then there's Eddie Hirsh-
berg who moved up to Dartmouth to
handle the ends a't the Hanover in-
stitution.

Knock off such mainstays as All-
Americans Ave Daniell, Bobbie La-

Spectator’s Clinic Ends
Spring Football Season

Rue, and Biff Glassford, and a score
of others and his task is even more
difficult.

But Saturday there was a clinic
and a very ambitious attempt at
that. This time, Sutherland attempt-
ed to cater to the ordinary fan, in
preference to his usual clinic policy
of attracting only the scientific stu-
dent, coach, or expert to take part
in the session. ,

It was judged successfully bythe
fans who incidentally were also in-
terested in gaining a pre-view of the
1937 outfit.-Slow motion and actual
executions of several of the Pitt
power plays gave the fans an inside
picture of just how touchdowns are
scored.

Sutherland explained each play
and answered questions over a mi-
crophone in the east press box. The
questions were_ collected by student
managers who passed through the
audience with pad and pencil. The
ﬁrst two varsity elevens and a hand-
ful of third-stringers were used in
the demonstration.

Sigma Kappa
Phi Holds
llpeu House

Including everything from “Mur-
der in the 01’ Red Barn” to ‘'0 Sole
Mio”, Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary
modern language fraternity, again
held its annual Open House Friday
evening, at Heinz House.

Mary Pallazgre, Ed."»7, president,
opened the program, and introduced
Anna Mae Dambroski, Ed37, who
acted as Mistress of Ceremonies.

After a piano selection by Harry
Goldby, C39, the French Club pre-
sented “De Medecin Malgre Lui”,
(A Doctor in Spite of Himself). Mo-
liere’s story of a wife’s attempted re-
venge at a cruel husband, and the
complications resulting, was well re-
ceived. ‘

The Italian Club presented a vari-
ety of muscal selections. A chorus
sang the above-mentioned “O Sole
Mio” and “La Espagnola”. Anthony
Caspero, C39, made passionate vocal
love to Leonora Molinari, C39, both
appropriately dressed for the occa-

sion. Vincent Gargaro. C40, played-

an accordian solo, followed by Lu-
cien Ciletti, Ed37, and Mary Rubino,
G, both of whom sang.

The digiiified, staid Classical Club
unbent terriﬁcally, presenting three
farcial numbers. A skit, “Helen Af-
ter Death”, by Sam Carini, C39,
started the downfall of the Classics.
Siren Helen of Troy was pictured
trying to ﬁnd Achilles in Hades, and
dragging him off after she ﬁnds him.
Juanita Carpenter. Ed37, then read
an original poem, deploring the lack
of a mythology course at the Uni-
versity. A pantomime, “Hero and
Leander”, sad tale of true love, ﬁn-
ished the Classical..Club’s offering.

From “Classics” -to mellerdrammer
in no easy jump, but Sigma Kappa
Phi can do anything. Accordingly,
the program ended with a German
rendition of “Murder in the Ol’ Red
Barn”, presented by the German
Club. The audience booed the villian,
cheered the hero. and literally sobbed
when the rat killed our fair hero-
me.

Refreshments and dancing followed
the various clubs’ presentations.

J ayvee, Frosh
Track Teams-
Card Dleetsi

There will be plenty of action on
the track front this week with three
different Pitt cinder teams running
in dual competition. The Junior Var-
sity, better known in its contracted
Jayvee form, will compete tomorrow
in its first meet of the year when
it meets the Slippery Rock State
Teachers outﬁt at the Stadium.

Wednesday the Freshman team
faces Altoona High School at the Sta-
dium in the fourth get-together of
the two crack aggregations. State in-
terscholastic champions, the Altoona
team has beaten the Panther year-
lings once, lost once, and one meet
has been a tie.

The third meet of the week, and
it is listed third only because of
chronologicalorder, is the Pitt-Army
contest at West Point on Saturday.

Untested by the strain of match
performance, the~Junior Varsity can
only be rated after tomorrow's in-
augural. Among those competing on
this squad are Redmond Oden in the
hurdles, Ed Routch in the sprints,
and senior ball chairman Gordy
Rauck in the middle distances. It
seems that all these dance chairmen
liearn their ballroom grace on the cin-
ers. -

Easily the most ‘thrilling game" of
the first week was the Politicos-Legal

LEWIS l’l’l'CHES

Lewis hurled capablyfor the win-
ners and except for the fifth inning
when the embryo lawyers scored ﬁve
runs, was given first~class support by
his mates. Despite their second
straight loss, the Legals served no-
tice that they will make things tough
for the other league members.

The Wolves snapped‘ back, from
their 19-7_ defeat’ ‘at the l_1_and,s- ,of
KAPhi last‘ Monday to‘ edge out the
Buzzers 10-9 in the Independent

batting honors. ' . '

November, a luncheon just before
mid-term ._examinations,- and a dance
last month, sophomores will round oil’
their year of events with a picnic to
be held this Thursday from 3 to 6

o’clock in Frick Park.

Ann Whippo, who as social chair-
man of the class has been in general
charge of these
events, is arrang-
ing to have plenty '

The class will meet at about a quar-
ter to three on the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Parkman street, across
from the Twentieth Century Club, be-
fore going out to the park. ,

Anyone who can bring a car is
asked to do so. Sophomores should let

“sign of the times.”

While declining to venture a ‘pre-
dic'tion on the Wagner Act (leClSl0n’.S
effect on President Roosevelt's judi-
cial reorganization plan, Dr. Madden
expressed his’ certainty that no de-
liberate filibuster will be staged in
Congress to retard progress of ,.the

bill. “My guess is,” he said, “that"t_he

Supreme Court question will be set-
tled in one way or another within a
month.”

He further advised that “for local
industries not covered by provisions
of the Wagner Act, there should be
state laws. But, he cautioned, “until
we have more experience, it should
be well enough not to go beyond 'the
provisions of the national act.”

Tossing off another ‘ spadeful of
dirt, he discussed his stay at Wash-
ington. “I enjoyed it very much,” he
said, “but not so much as teaching

here at Pitt.” He also explained that _

gardening is a hobby with him.

Dr. Madden, who is-the father of
the tennis-playing Maddens, Joe and

‘Altruism

Causes

Parasites’
Dr. Williams Claims

Individualism Doesn't
Follow Natural Laws
By JOHN._MARTlNCO

Humans, with their altruistic '

tendencies and resultant over-
sentimentality, have made too
many parasites‘ ‘among their
fellow men, D1‘. Samuel 11.
Williams, professor of biology, be-
lieves.

. Dr. Williams, speaking at the sec-
ond session of the Student-Facul‘t_v
Forum Friday noon. declared that
‘two are over-sentimental in our atti-
tiide toward the physically and men-
tally unfit. We have too many para-
sites," he added, “and the idea of the
government helping the individual
doesn't strike at the root of the prob-
lem.”

Discussing “Human versus Animal
Society,” Dr. Williaim .<:iid that many
animals, especially iii::<oct.s, have ii
uioi'e mcclianically efficient set-up in
their society than man and that hu-
iiiiiiis are merely duplicating many
t‘hings'found in animal life. But he
also added that the greatest achieve-
ment of the human mind, “considera-
tion for the other fellow,” is not pres-
ent in aiiiinal society.

“Biologically,” he said, “a person
has no place in society as an individ-
ual. As individuals, we have only one
right to achieve, and to receive the

products of our fellow man. The in-‘

tllV'l(lUEll ninst depend upon society
for his existence.” _

He declared that he holds “an opti-
iiiistic \'l(’,V‘\'pOll'll. as to the future of
—soi-ict_v.” The pro:-.:eiit state of society,
he explained, may be only one phase
of the pendulum’s swing, which will
cveiitiially swing back to normalcy.
