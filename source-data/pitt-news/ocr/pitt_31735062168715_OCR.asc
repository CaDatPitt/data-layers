UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

SGEC Announces
New Election Rules
For SG Campaign

The Student Government Elec-
tions Committee. (SGEC), chair-

ed by SG President Ralph Man— -

ning, has issued a policy state-
ment to govern the forthcoming
SG election.

Implicit in the rules was the
following declaration: “All can-
didates and political organiza-
tions are encouraged to empha-

size their own achievements and

platforms. Any willful misrepre-
sentation _of another candidate’s
position (past or present) or will-
ful malignment of another candi-

-date’s character should be con-

sidered unethical and, if brought
to the attention of the SGEC, will
be made public.”

Disciplinary action will be
taken for the following illegal
practices: I

> Giving brides to voters or
election officials. ‘

>"‘Ba1lot-box stuffing.”

> Misuse ‘of University funds,
facilities, or name.

> Any other substantially iden- ’

tical practices.

> Public disclosure of violation
of this code by candidates, par-
ties, and their supporters. The
SGEC will not hesitate to pub-
lishl these violations for the con-
sideration of the electorate.

> Private disclosure of viola-

tions of this code by candidates,-

parties, and their supporters.
SGEC also announced that the

‘campaign officially begins Mon-

day for a two-week duration. The
Towers policy will be suspended
for the ﬁnal week of the cam-

paign, when literature will be
permitted to be distributed un-
der the doors. All petitions, fees,
and slates are due Jan. 16, and
every declared _candidate must
attend an SGEC meeting Jan. 18
at noon "or 6 p.m. in 320 SU.
Voting will be held in the SU
Ballroom Jan. 23 from 9:30 a.m.
to 7 p.m. At this time, no cam-
paigning will be permitted on
the main ﬂoor of the SU. Cam-'
paigning is deﬁned as “any ac-
tion which encourages ‘people to
vote for a particular candidate or
slate of candidates, such as dis-
tributing literature, public speech-
es on the ,main floor by candi-
dates or their supporters, and
greeting potential voters by ‘can-
didates or their supporters.”

Acting Chancellor

New Academic ‘Calendar

(See Editorial, “ACLU’s Bad
Advice,” Page Four)
2 The University will take no
stands on the rightocf the House
Un-American Activities Commit-
tee (HUAC) to subpoena for the
membership lists of campus or-

ganizations, until such a situa- '

tion arises, Acting Chancellor Da-
vid Kurtzman announced.

Dr. Kurtzman’s statement was
in answer to a letter sent to 900
college and university presidents
by the American Civil Liberties"
Union (ACLU) asking them to
oppose action similar to that at
the University of Michigan and
the University of California at

I " Berkeley.

According to the letter, HUAC
had subpoenaed membership lists
of campus organizations opposed
to United States policy in Viet-

Spring Trimester Change Planned

According to statements in C

the November-December is-
sue of the Faculty News, stu-
dents may expect a change
in the academic calendar of
the University. The faculty
organ credited Acting Chancel-
lor David Kurtmnan with a state-
ment that the University had de-
cided to retain a modiﬁed three-
term calendar at least through

the next academic year.

What the modiﬁed calendar
would be like wasn’t made clear.
The Faculty _News mentioned that
“one of the changes being con-
sidered is the establishment of
a split third term.” This particu-

lar suggestion calls for two sum- .

mer sessions-—the ﬁrst running
from the end of April to mid-

June and the second from mid- .

June to rnid-August.
Kurtzman’s main arguments for

a change such as this one, as
noted in the faculty report, were
that this might attract students-
who were willing to work nine
months of the year, but not 11_
Another reason was that this
modiﬁcation would enable the
University to accommodate visit-
ing faculty, school teachers, and
entering freshmen who cannot
come here until the close of the
normal
June.

About any change in the calen-
dar, Kurtzman said, “We wouldn’t
want to make calendar changes
that might limit the number of
students we can accept at a time
when there is a demand to ex-
pand enrollment. The reduced

tuition under the new state rela-

tionship may make the triniester
system work better, and we feel
we at least ought to test it,” con-
tinued Kurtzman.

I At Pitt News’ Request

Dean Issues Drug

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Because
of the growing problem of stu-
dent usage of illegal drugs on
campuses across the nation,
The Pitt News felt it was'*im-
portant to clarify the Univer-
sity’s drug policy. When mem-
bers of the editorial board dis-

cussed the problem with Uni- .

versity students, we felt there
was general confusion about

ator must have their photo-
graphs taken Tuesday after-
noon from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

how the administration -would
deal with this situation_. There-
fore, the editorial board re-
quested that the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs state the Univer-
sity policy and the following
is her reply. We hope this will
be the ﬁrst in a series of arti-
cles discussing this problem.
Comments on the policy are
welcomed from members of
the University community)
Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to your inquiry,
the following is the University
policy on the subject:

We are aware that across the,
country there are groups of
young people using amphetamins,
barbiturates, hallucinogens and
marijuana. This often beings as
experimentation, as relief from
tension, as desire for excitement,
or as escape from reality. The
results can be tragic. Usually
there is need for counseling or

. medical help before it is tooilate.

 -th b

 

P 1’

stance on campus of a student
acknowledging to me use of these’
drugs, it would be naive to as-
sume that there is’ no danger of
it becoming a problem on the
Pitt campus with a few students.
We of the University Adminis-
tration are alert to the possibil-
ity. The possession, use, or dis-
tribution of non-prescribed,‘ hab-
it-forming or addictive drugs is
not permitted.

We always seek constructive
ways of dealing with a violation.
of any regulation. Conﬁdences
are respected. A student who
honestly seeks help is never tum-
ed over to civil authorities un-

life and well-being of others or
infringes on the rights of others

- in a way thatcan only be dealt

with by civil authorities.
We welcome at any time a
discussion of the problem with
_v individuals.

   

semester calendar in -

less that person endangers the.

According ‘to Kurtzman, the
Board of Trustees will probably
deal with this calendar question
Tuesday, when they have their
regular Winter meeting.

The six-year-old trimester sys-
tem came under heavy ﬁre last
spring when the Ford Foundation
Report on the University's ﬁnan-
cial situation was released. This
report cited the trimester system
as a majorcause of the ‘poor ﬁ-
nancial status of the University.
A trimester calendar, said the re-
port in one criticism, necessitated
year round salary payments to
faculty, "and the amount of stu-
dent tuition payments in the
spring trimester did not cover
this expense. U -

nam in what the ACLU called,
“one of the mo-st serious breach-[A-
es of academic freedom of stu-__'
dents in recent decades,. not ex- 9‘
cluding the McCarthy era.” ,
Dr. Kurtzman said that under‘_‘
the present system of recognition”:
of ‘campus organizations “such;
an examination (of members)";
should not be necessary.”

Campus organizations must pe-' ;
tition for and be given recogni-55
tion by the Recognitions Comrni_t\
tee composed in part by members "
of Student Government. “I 
our Student Government is sen-I
sible enough not to recognize 
organization which put us ‘into
difficulty,” Dr. Kurtzman said.‘

Since the Office of StudentVA.f-‘
fairs has lists of only the officers»;
of recognized organizations, the
office could not even give _:
of members if subpoenaed, Dr. “
Kurtzman pointed out. I

Dr. Kurtzman also noted that

» if subpoenaed, a university would 1

be required to turn over the re-
quested lists despite its opposi-

tion.’ According to the ACLU,‘

however, there is strong likeli-.
hood that if universities did con-
test a subpoena in the courts such
a challenge would be upheld..

In the University of Michigan:

case, authorities gave to HUAC
lists containing 65 names of mem:-
bers of a Committee to Aid the
Vietnamese, an aifiliate\of Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society,
and a local chapter of the W. E.
B. DuBois Club, the ACLU said.f

The.ACLU protested that those)‘
named were not so advised so 1_

that they at least might have

had the opportunity to seek legal-'_

advice.

Administration   Changes
. Policies In Cafeterias

(See Editorial, Page Four)

Major changes in the services
of the Towers’ and Schenley Caf-
eterias have been armounced by
David M. Smith, assistant to the
vice chancellor of ﬁnance. Un-
derthe new system meal tickets
will be honored in the Schenley
Cafeteria, but non-resident stu-
dents will not be permitted to
eat weekday dinners in the Tow-
ers’ Cafeteria; All these changes
are now in effect.

To reduce the crowding in the
Towers’ Cafeteria all cash meals.

except breakfast Monday through‘

Friday will be shifted to Schen-
ley Cafeteria where more space
is available. Cash breakfast every-
.day andlunch or dinner on Sat-
urday or Sunday will continue‘ to
be available in the Towers’ Cafe-
teria.

Towers’ Cafeteria meal tickets
will be honored in the Schenley
Cafeteria for both lunch and din-
ner. The meal ticket will receive
80 cents credit at lunch and $1.25
credit at dinner. Purchases in ex-
cess of these amounts will be
paid by the customer.

Smith explained that in order
to relieve the crowded conditions

in the Hunt Room and Tuck Shop, ’

.5.’  x A. ._  ,8!-‘hen.-.T

   

ley Cafeteria will be extended to
include snack bar items such as
hot dogs, hamburgers, french
fries, milk shakes, etc. at the

same prices as in the other loca-_

tions.
All meals in the Schenley Cafe-

teria will be on an ala carte?
basis, except on the eveningf
menu there will be a $1.25 din-_ '.
ner special. No second helpings:-P
‘ will be permitted in the Schen-

ley Cafeteria as they are in the J

Towers Cafeteria.

A survey of the food service)‘
facilities disclosed “an unbalance '
in use,” according to Smith. Some '_
areas were badly crowded, while 7

others were not fully utilized

Smith commented that on some '
nights there would beas many_

as 300 extra people (non-resi
dents) eating dinner in the Tow
ers’ Cafeteria.

  The   Cafeteria Cha A

The University administration seems like it’s making honest at-
tempts to improve the food service. While the recently announced changes
_ doimprove service to students, these changes also have deﬁnite drawbacks.
Under the new system resident and non-resident students will be able
_to eat lunch together in a cafeteria where the Towers’ meal tickets will
-be given credit. While the University did cancel the non-resident’s right
- to eat dinner in the Towers, it was also announced that the resident stu-
dents would receive meal ticket credit for dinner in the Schenley Cafeteria.
.Moreover, a broader selection of items will be available in Schenley.
However, the new system creates as many barriers between the
commuters and dorm students as it attempts to break down. A‘ commuter
student will now have to make arrangements in advance with a friend
' who lives in the dorms if they-are to eat together. Dorm students will
hesitate to join friends in the Schenley Cafeteria. because of the low

  

 

ii" ‘ credit. given to their meal tickets. In the Towers’ Cafeteria unlimited sec-

‘ ond helpings are permitted. There won’t be any seconds in Schenley.
The administration rightly claimed that the Towers’ Cafeteria is

l_ overly crowded while the Schenley Cafeteria was empty.

L The administration also admitted that much of the crowding was

i due to use of the Towers’ at dinner by people from the Oakland area.

» and even by students from Carnegie Tech.

With the high University deﬁcit, we can not expect the administra-
_ tion to make arrangements which would lose them money. However,
" _if use of the Towers at lunch and.dinner was limited to full-time Univer-
sity students the cafeteria would not be so crowded. One way to break

C down this wall between commuters and residents would be to ask for i

an ID card when purchasing a meal. in the Towers.

A  i The Student’s Struggle

Two Weeks For Finals
C S by Paul Stoller

HE SAT in his dimly lit room looking over his study material. He
I stood up .and slowly walked toward his mirror and noticed that his hand
was shaking. Peering at himself in the mirror, he saw the dull red glow
A of his bloodshot eyes. He stretched his neck in the direction of the wall
clock and realized that there‘ were 12 more hours till his last ﬁnal of
the term. He thought, after four ﬁnals "in just three days, how can I
“get up” for this last one. I’m so tired. My mind wanders. I just can’t
« study anymore. Heslowly waddled toward his bed, threw himself on it,
and then mumbled, “to hell with this.” ‘
»— These symptoms are far too representative of the University stu-
1 dent. Must the University student accept the great burden of tensions
forced upon him by the existence of the ﬁnal exam. Surely the Univer-
sity student should be prepared to meet the rigorous challenge of col-
‘ lege life. But, when-the challenge causes internal frustration and phy-
. sical distress, the challenge should be subdued.

, Unfortunately, college tensions are not subdued at the University.
In fact, the trimester system creates even more tension and frustration
for the -student. Instead of completing a normal 18 week semester, we
at the University are forced to cram a course into a mere 14 week per-

 iod, with one week alloted for ﬁnal exams. '

IT IS, ‘indeed, a pity that most of the students at the University _

are well aware‘of the rigors of ﬁnals week. During ﬁnals week, all of
: the tensions and frustrations of the term come to a head. It is during
ﬁnals week that students stay up nights, take pills, and generally “get
tense.” It is relatively easy to realize the causes for these phenomena.
_The cause is simply the great importance of the ﬁnal exam. Many courses
I at the University only involve a mid-term and a ﬁnal—-—the ﬁnal being
given the greater consideration. Consequently, in some of the courses
. at the University ﬁnal exams count as much as 60 per cent of the ﬁnal
‘_ grade. ' .
 Whether the ﬁnal exam can be given a lessened importance is_quite
.a controversial topic. In many cases, ﬁnals determine whether or not a
 student has grasped the total perspective of a course. Thus, to many peo-

ple, the importance of the ﬁnal exam is that it ties together the loose,

: strings of a course. In reality, the ﬁnal exam will never be eliminated.

The American Civil, Liberties Union (ACLU) has indeed made an
absurd request of the University. In effect, the ACLU ‘is asking colleges
across the nation to do the ACLU’s work for them..

It is not the purpose of this editorial to discuss the relative merits
of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC). The fact is
that it is a standing committee of the duly elected members of the House
of Representatives. If the ACLU feels this committee is.not doing its
job then it should,-appeal to the Congressmen for reform.

To ask the University to ignore the HUAC subpoena is demanding
a type of civil disobedience in which no institution should become in-
volved. Not only does the ACLU ask colleges to hide information that
should be a matter of public record. The University should not be put
in the position of protecting secret societies.

As Acting Chancellor Dr. David Kurtzman wisely pointed out, it
}is unlikely that the University will be subpoenaed. To begin with
none of the groups in question at the University of Michigan have rec-
ognized chapters atvPitt. Moreover, even if they did have chapters, rec-
ognized student organizations are not required to turn in membership
lists. «However, if HUAC should petition the University, we would hope

the University would not take the unwise advice offered by the ACLU.

Stamps and Parking Garages

A Sea of Trivialityl  
by Michael Bro_urman

A WHILE back, a group known as the United Negro Protest Com-
mittee picketed, of all things, a parking garage. It seems that the garage
owners, in an attempt to add some life to their property, had .painted
each -ﬂoor a different color. On the walls were the translations of the ﬂoo
colors into foreign languages. '

What the UNPC objected to was the Spanish word for black, negro.
They wanted ‘it removed as objectionable. -

The UNPC “won” that argument when the garage owners volun-
tarily removed the word. But, in the process, the UNPC drew heavly criti-
cism. Not from the_KKK, but from responsible groups. From people who
couldn’t understand why, with so many important things needing done,
a Civil Rights group would spend its time on something so ridiculous.

LAST MONTH, the American Civil Liberties Union threatened to
take court action to prevent the issuing of a United States postage stamp.
It seems the Christmas stamp portrays a work of art with a religious
motif.

The ACLU has stated that it believes the stamp is unconstitutional
because it shows favoritism to one religion. .

There seems to be a direct correlation between the action of the
UNPC and that of the ACLU. The ACLU is the self-appointed watchdog
of our freedoms. It was involved in the historic Supreme Court decision,
Brown vs. the‘ Board of Education (1954), which ruled that segregated
schools were unconstitutional.

MORE RECENTLY, it has been involved in the Escobedo decision,
which protects the rights of persons accused of crimes. At the same time,
they have vigorously promoted the taxation of church-owned property.

The point is this. Whilemuch of the work done by the ACLU is
controversial to say the least, it is important. If ideas are not the sub-
ject of discussion and conﬂict, they become useless dogma and die. Only
when one is forced to defend an idea does he perceive it rationally and
clearly, both its strongs points and its weaknesses. »

In the »-past, the ACLU has served as a sort of devil’s advocate,
forcing us to reconsider some of our old notions. In this job, it has been
a very helpful force in promoting human progress.

But, with this angle, it shows signs of losing. its value. Just
because a painting is religious, it should not be disqualiﬁed from use by
the Post Office. The ACLU has much more deserving and vital things
to do with its time than this. It is to be hoped that they get back on the
track before they get hopelessly bogged down in a sea of triviality.

Panther Basketball
p A Really Big Mess

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

' Watching Pitt basketball is about as exciting as the
thought of making love to Phyllis Diller. Both have the ca-
- pacity of killing whatever enthusiasm that might exist.

lIlllllllllllllllllllllllllIIllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllli.

For the past two years the only sounds that have ﬁlled
the Field House during the Winter months have been the
 squeaks of ten pairs of sneakers and the echos of a bouncing

. basketball. The only cheers that have been uttered were
‘those of the band. And somebody must
have been paying them’becau_se only nat-
ural sadists_ would cheer at what they’ve
been watching.

It doesn’t look like there will be any

   
 

ketball lovers what it amounts _to is a sim-
ple case of murder. This was supposed to
be the year that the Panthers would break
even with the average teams and come
close to the good ones.

V Instead, in their ﬁrst eight games this season they
have only managed to break even with the bad teams and
come close to the average teams. What makes the 2-6 rec-

ord to date look really bad is that the good teams are yet
_ to come. i

— At the present rate the hoopsters will be lucky if they
r better last year’s 5-17 — record.

Prior to this season some eternal optimists were ac-
tually hopeful. Last year's freshmen had behaved admir-
ably with a 12-5 record which included wins over West Vir-
gina and Duquesne. '

, But what works well for freshmen doesn’t always work
_ well for the varsity. Dave Welty decided that baseball was
___more important than basketball. Tim Fisher became in-
eligible. Tony DeLisio and Al.DiFrischia have yet to prove
"that they are as good as their advance notices were.

» Combined with the almost total sophomore collapse was
"the recent dismissal of co-captain Stan Falenski for disci-
plinary reasons. Only four years ago he used to be one of the
best basketball players in Western Pennsylvania.

If the present situation is depressing to the. average
basketball -fan, think what it must be like to Bob Timmons.
His job depends on it and right now even Lyndon J ohnson’s
job appears to be more secure.

 ._ But Timmons has a rather calm if not peculiar way of
‘looking at the situation. » A p
. Concerning the lack of-spirit at Pitt games, he said,
“I don’t think the transition betweenhigh school spirit and
-what they ﬁnd here bothers the boys that much. I think
they’re happy to be playing and they’re also getting a good
education. '
“Boys who come here are very lucky, because they

have that opportunity to play and get an education which
they can utilize. '

  
    
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
    
  
  
  
  
   
    
  
    
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
   

_, If that is 'I‘immon’s selling line while he is recruiting,
T it’s no wonder he hasn’t recruited a real star in the past
three years. For no really great athlete can be content with
_ Just playing; He also wants to win and be part of a winning‘
tnadition. ’ _
‘ Timmons doesn’t think that losing has been ingrained

. ning certainly hasn’t either. 
j ’ “I don’t think there is
‘anybody on this team who
~ doesn’t want to win,” said
Timmons. “But desire isn’t
everything, you have to have
ability.”
As Timmons indicated, the
"Panthers don’t have that
much ability and in some
games it is even question-
_able if the desire is there. As
» the season becomes longer it
; will be more questionable.
If basketball games were
“only 20 minutes instead of
40, the Panthers might ac-
tually be respectable. But no
[matter how close they come
in the ﬁrst half they always
seem to fade in the second. _Has His Problems

fsaid Timmons. '
_ “The games you really get concerned about are the

“Since Falenski has left,” he

High Scoring,

A slowdown administered by
J ohnstown College last week halt-
ed the high scoring of the fresh-
man cages, but coach Tim Grgu-
rich’s team still shows some im-
pressive statistics in early season
play.

The frosh mastered the Johns-
town slowdown in the second
half and scored an easy 60-39 vic-
tory after leading by only seven
points at the half. It was their
third straight win of the season.

In those three games, Bob Pe-

scorer, hitting on 52 per cent of
his shots from the ﬁeld, and
averaging 28 points a game. Mike
Patcher has also hit 52 per cent
while averaging 18 points, and
leads the team in rebounds.

Petrini’s backcourt partner Dick
Hassinger has hit 50 per cent of
his shots from the ﬁeld and 93

per cent from the foul line while

averaging 10 points a contest.

As a team, the freshmen have
hit on 43 per cent of their ﬁeld
goal attempts and 71 per cent of
their foul shots while rolling up
an average of 85 points a game.

-Despite his team’s hot scoring,
Grgurich has concentrated on de-
tense in practice. That this has
paid off is apparent in the fact
that the frosh have held their
opponents to an average of a
little more than 40 points a game.

Mr.,Ftobert Byman V August 25, 1965
University of Illinois ' ‘

-Champaign, Illinois _ g 

Dear Mr. Byman:

‘There is an urgent need, I believe, for a serious discussion between campus and corporation.

I am genuinely concerned about recent studies which indicate that an alarming percentage of college
- _ students have no interest in pursuing careers in business. Many of these students show little respect
 for business and have a condescending attitude towards those who do choose it as a career.

Some say business leaves them cold. Lacks action. That it's boring, unimaginative, stuffy and
self—seeking. Others say they don't want to be lost in the corporate crowd and that there is little chance
of early recognition for a young man in business. Some question whether business offers the
opportunity for the personal satisfaction that comes from humanitarian ‘service. Their answer: Join the
Peace Corps or VISTA; teach; or enter a service profession.

If you are motivated toward teaching, medicine, government or law, I say go at it eagerly. They are
valuable careers for which we in business have great respect and admiration. Many of our most able
business leaders have professional backgrounds and our everyday operations bring us into close
contact with men outside of industry.

However, don't sell business short. It you shrug off a business career because you think it offers no
excitement, no challenge, no chance for recognition or to make a meaningful contribution to society. . .
I think you're wrong.

 A tremendous opportunity for human and social betterment may well slip away if brighter

:7. , , studentsturn their backs onbusiness for reasons not necessarily valid. The coming years promise

" fantastic new developments in the sciences, electronics, transportation or just about any field you can
name. However, realization of these great potentials requires fresh thinking, young, vigorous minds
able to channel ideas creatively and productive|y.. . . able to make decisions . . . able to generate
action, the very thing you crave. ‘'

 

This is why I'm concerned. If I read, some of you right, we're in trouble. Something has broken down,
 _ somewhere. Perhaps certain college students are misinformed and should be set straight. Or maybe
5- we in- business had ‘best undertake a basic reappraisal of our way of doing things. It changes are in
‘ I order, I'd like to find out. ‘

Frankly, we don't understand each other well enough . . . we don't communicate enough. And,
therefore, I propose we set a specific course to try to resolve this.

 

Let's discuss business openly, two-way, pro and con, on the pages of your campus newspaper.
You express the views of those around you. I'll respond. Tell me what you think is wrong with business,
what might be changed. Why you feel there are more exciting opportunities elsewhere. If neither of us
pulls our punches, I think we hav_e a lot to gain. - ’

Interested? I hope so. Send me your thoughts regarding business as well as an indication that you
will join in a discussion. I will print your comments and mine in subsequent issues of this paper.

We can't do this too soon. Tomorrow's problems and opportunities won't wait.
Sincerely, '

,

In August, I wrote this letter to Bob Byman, University of Illinois student. I] It is an invitation to a dialogue about
business—a dialogue which has been appearing regularly in this newspaper for the past few months. Mr. Byman’s
response was provocative and to the point. I hope l’ve answered some of the questions he raised. El Shortly ,
after the dialogues started, I began to get letters from other students and faculty membersexpressing interest
in the series and asking why not open the dialogues to others—get the views of everyone on campus. Students,
teachers, and administrators. El That’s exactly what I'd like to do. And while I obviously can’t promise that every
letter will appear in print, I can assure you that I will read each and respond. 1:] Whatever your major study, what- ’
ever your ideas—|’d like to hear from you. You may want to agree or disagree with some of the past dialogues or
bring up new issues that haven't been explored. You may just want to sound off about business. It's up to you.
