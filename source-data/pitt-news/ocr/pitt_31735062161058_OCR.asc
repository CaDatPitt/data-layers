Pitt libraries
‘race against

time’ to save
older books

By Jacinta M. Dvorak
For The Pitt News

Some one-of-a-kind I books, found
nowhere else in the United States except
,_f r the University of Pittsburgh's research
.E§)raries, are in danger of being destroyed.
 “»It’s a problem that all research libraries
have,” said Sally Buchanan, assistant
director for Preservation Services and
Cooperative Planning.

“Pitt has about 20 percent of its research
library in danger of being lost. This
number is relatively low compared to
other research libraries across the country,
such as Yale, which has about 40 percent
of [its] research collection in danger of
being destroyed," said Buchanan.

The acidic paper used during the late
19th and early 20th centuries is
responsible for the decay of these books.
Before this time period, paper was
produced by cotton and linen rags. The
older editions of some books are in
excellent condition, while books from
the turn of the century aren’t so lucky.

“It’s a race against time. Our library is ‘

better off than Yale's or Columbia’s, but
the condition of these books needs to be
improved.” said Buchanan. “We are
working with other libraries nationally
and internationally to try and save as
much material as we can.”

The preservation department at Pitt is
quite new. The department realizes that
there is a need for educating people
about the preservation of these books.
Funds are being raised for the sole purpose
of restoring these books.

One book in danger is a unique novel
dealing with World War II. This novel is

_ special because it lists the names of A

‘ families that could not be traced because
of the separation caused by the war. The
book was published right after the end of
the war. ‘

“As far as we know there is not another
copy of this book. The book is so brittle

BAS sponsors
resume
writing
workshop

By Leon Fuksman
For The Pitt News

Concerns about finding jobs led some
students to attend the Black Action Society’s
resume-writing workshop last Tuesday
night.

Joyce Moorman Lee, a counselor at the
University Placement Center at Pitt, spoke
to minority students about the importance
of writing a one—page resume.

“A resume is all facts and should answer
any questions employers have [about the
employeel,” said Lee. “After 16 years of
experience with the placement center, I
know what information for a resume is
valuable.”

A well—structured resume should consist
of five sections: objective, education,
experience, activities and interests, and
honors, awards and special skills.

According to Lee, being able to write on
a resume that a 3.0 grade point average
was maintained in college will increase
the chances of
employers will look at resumes of students
with a 3.0 average before considering any
others.

Also, an extra two or three thousand
dollars can be ‘added to an employee’s
salary depending on the GPA. Therefore,
Lee encouraged underclassmen to “bring
up the GPA, because it is important in the
future." A

Lee urged students to contact counselors
at the placement center of the William Pitt
Union for advice on writing resumes and
preparing for job interviews.

Della Williams, the coordinator of the

resume workshop, hoped the seminars

familiarized students with constructing a
resume. l“We utilized the expertise of
working professional individuals to
conduct the workshop."

Several freshmen were present among
the mostly upperclassman audience. “I
didn't expect many freshmen to be present
at the seminar. It is important for freshmen
to learn early what is expected on a

Best-selling author discusses real life motivations

By Sharon Romanovich
For The Pitt News

Scott Turow never thought that he
would become a best-selling author.

Turow, author of the novel Presumed
Innocent, said he had “fantasies of

Q becoming a well-known author "on the

basis of [Presumed Innocent], but it was
never particularized enough to include a
vision of the [New York Hmes] Best Seller
List,” during a reading of some of his
works at the Frick Fine Arts Building on
Tuesday.
However, his book did make the Best
t.;6eller List. It entered at No. 2, and went

on to spend 44 weeks at No. 1. Turow
said that the Best Seller List was never a
specific goal.

“I, like most writers, had accepted
long before that my kind of writing was
never going to appear on the Best Seller
List,” said Turow, who is also a practicing
lawyer in Chicago. "While I certainly
thought that I could make some
concessions to commercial realities in
the writing of Prwumedlnnocent, I never
foresaw that it would appear on the Best
Seller List I never thought it would be a
No. 1 best seller. I never thought it would
stay there for 44 weeks.”

However, he did admit that ‘while I

was finishing the book, there were
occasionally times when I was frankly
convinced that I had written something
great." I

Someone in Hollywood must have
agreed. T urow’s novel is being made into
a movie starring Harrison Ford and Raul
Julia.

When asked how he felt about his
book being made into a movie, Turow
replied, “How would you feel? To be
dead honest, I’m prouder of the book
than the fact that someone’s making a
movie out of it, because the movie is not
my achievement, it's theirs. [But] it's still
a gas!"

When talking about Presumed
Innocent, Turow admits that “many ideas
were taken from [my] real experiences [as
a lawyer]. The very setting is derived
from my experience while I was a law
student in the Suffolk County DA’s office
in Boston." T urow said that when it
comes to writers taking ideas from real
life, “it’s sort of up to each writer. The
realist mode of writing is still alive.”

T urow said, “The problem [in writing]
is most people feel like they have to
bastardize their work in order to make it
popular.”

In spite of the success of Turow’s

IFC discusses community service

By Karen Speece
and Shelena Rauscher
Staff Writers

The Interfraternity Council
proposed several community
service programs at a meeting
held on Tuesday.

Among the plans discussed by
Jim Venturella, IFC president,
was an idea to shovel snow for
residents living in North Oakland.
He also discussed plans to solicit
funds by telephone from various

people for the Three Rivers

,Outing. Further details will be

discussed at the next IFC meeting.

The Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh and Chautauqua at Pitt
contacted Venturella about their
need for volunteers. He presented
the ideas to the fraternities and
let each individual house decide
its own charitable event.

Also discussed were plans for
spring break anda Pitt vs. Miami
social. The IFC was also informed
of a Rocky Horror Halloween

Some of the fraternities were

the only two fraternities to be
visited were Phi Delta Theta and
Delta Sigma Phi. At these houses
everything was found to be in
order. The advisers plan to
continue this practice of visiting
throughout the year.

See novel, he still holds on to his
law practice. “The practice is
still the anchor in my life. It’s the
reality to which I must always
return. [It’s] something that keeps
me going in a fundamental way,”
Turow said.

Turow was originally a writing
major, and he received his
master's degree at Stanford
University, where he was an
E.H. Jones Lecturer in creative
writing for three years. He said
he went through a “wonderful”
writing program“ and he was
“writingevery day, learning how
to demand that work from
myself.” Turow also “had some
time as a journalist, which is also
very helpful. as you learn to
write on demand: not when
you're inspired, butwrite, now!”

While Presumed Innocent is .

Scott T urow’s first work of fiction,
he has also written a non—ﬁction
account of nis ﬁrst ‘year at
Harvard Law School, which is

still used as a guide for all first- A

year law students. Itwas adapted

left from a journal Turow kept his

first yearat Harvard.

“I don’t think it is typical any
longer of most law ‘ students’
experiences, at least in the
gravest aspects.” said Turow.
The book, titled Onel.-An Inside
Account of Life in the First Year

. at Harvard Law School, was

published during T urow’s third
year at Harvard.

resume," said Williams.

Freshman Ozias Moore said,
“The workshop was helpful and
informative. I want to start getting
ideas as a freshman about what
to put on a resume."

The resume—writing workshop
was the second seminar in a
series of three presented by BAS
to equip students for the Nov. 9
Minority Job Fair, where over 80
companies will be represented.
Mellon Bank, Ford Motor

Company and IBM are some of .

the companies expected to be at
the fair. , ‘ ,
‘These workshops are to assist

I students in being comfortable and

preparing for the semi—working
type setting of the Fair,” said

Williams.

Books

Continued from page 1
Seethat there is no way to turn a
page without destroying it.” said
Buchanan. The book is currently
being restored and is going to
be put on microfilm. “It’s our
responsibility to see that the
content of this novel survives.”

When a book arrives and is
brittle or is falling apart, a Search
is made. Libraries across the
country are contacted to see if

there is another available copy. . v

If this is not, the case it is the
preservation department’s job
to make sure that the book ‘is
saved. Saving a text may take on
a variety of forms including
restoring the original copy and
putting it on microfilm.
Financing for the preservation

of these works comes from a
variety of sources. “There are
several foundations that make
preservational grants,” said
Buchanan. “Another way of
raising funds is lookingat the
local community. Some people
are very interested in saving
books and manuscripts.”
“There needs to be some
account taken from the allocation

of funds that the university gives '

to the library system.”

The best, way to stop the
deterioration of these books is
prevention. However, this
becomes difficult because of
poor paper and adverse
environmental conditions. \

“We hadn’t been aware until

the last 20 years or so that our
collections were going to be so
affected by high temperatures.
Now we know, and we are
working to try and correct that,”

said Buchanan. ,When the

Hillman Library was built in
1969, air conditioning was
installed. This air conditioning
is now being used as a preventive
measure to save books, since air
conditioning slows down the
rate of deterioration.

Buchanan adds, “It is a serious
problem that all university
research libraries have. It is a
serious crisis for this library
system and library systems across
the world.”

  City Theatre presents Mamet’s American Buffalo

By Jennifer Davis
For The Pitt News

“The plot of ‘American
Buffalo’ by David Mamet turns
on a nickel.” More ‘specifically,
the action of this play centers
around a frivolous scam to steal
a buffalo nickel from a coin
collector.

From this summary, one might

wonder how a play can be
centered around a nickel, and
even more importantly, what does
this symbolize? The answer is
simple, yet complex.

The simplicity is evident in the
plot. A junk shop owner named
Donny Dubrow (Bingo O’Malley)
sells what he thinks is a worthless
nickel to a coin collector for 90
dollars. At first, Donny thinks that

Locals Special Ed release self-titled album

By Manny Theiner
Staff Writer

Special Ed is a band from
McKeesport. And what’s “special”
about this Ed is’ that they’re
unusual in the Pittsburgh area for
not overdosing on jangly pop or
rehashing various portions of the
’50s, '60s and ’70s.

Well, that’s not completely true,
according to Chuck McPherson,
in charge of “atmosphere and
debris” (i.e. lighting) for Special
Ed. They at least enjoy the
alternative music of the 705, from
Black Sabbath to Henry Cow,

‘2;§§:ﬂEl,

fromKing Crimson to Hawkwind.
And there's some punk rock in
there too. So Special Ed combines
the best of metal, electronic, art-
rock and SST—style punk into a
formidable synergistic unit.

All right, so you don’t believe
me. It’s not possible for a band
from this town of musical
mediocrity to do all that, you say.
But indeed they do on their brand
new record When It Rains It
Foams. The LP is on the local
Cubist Productions label, which
was also recently responsible for
pressing the first single from Crow
Flies, and it shows more diversity

and creativity from the band than
ever before.

Previously, Special Ed made
ripples in the independent music
world‘, not to mention No. 1 on
WRCT, with their self—titled LP in
1986, and a cassette released
before that’s called N0 M0 Wrists.
At that time, their sound consisted
of concise bursts of Minutemen-
oriented art punk interwoven with
the lyrical ravings of guitarist Mark
Chute. The music was already
sufficient bait, but nobody bit.

In 1987, Special Ed was heavily
involved in the short—lived scene
at the American Legion, playing

alongside bands like Cousin It
and Bone of Contention. They
had a particularly close affiliation
with Carsickness (and still do),
but while Carsickness reached
critical condition when the horns
departed, Special Ed only kept
improving. ‘

During the Legion era, Special
Ed did their first genre-switching"
show when they played all their
regular tunes using mellotron,
synths, and electronic drums. That
legendary night was recorded for
posterity on the cassette The Love
Tobias, which has a bright orange
cover. S ’

The lineup shifted, and ﬁnally
cemented to include Bob Loiselle
on bass and Doug Heaps on
drums. Special Ed proceeded to
tear through several sets at the
Foundry, and then opened for
Skin Yard, Alice Donut, and the
Tar Babies at the Sonic Temple.
They also played an all-acoustic
set at the Turmoil Room, warming
up for Fish and Roses, with the
highlight being Bob Loiselle’s
unexpectedly deft marimba
technique during the wacky song

Michael Myers doing his thing 1n“Halloween 5.

By Richard Turgeon
For The Pitt News

Halloween 5 may very well go
down in history as the greatest
American horror film sequel of
the decade. Just kidding.

It begins where the easily
forgettable Halloween 4 left off,
with the film’s resident
psychopath, Michael Myers, being
shot into a grave at close range by
a sheriff's posse. He is discovered
by a mysterious old man who
apparently nurses him back to
health, and when Michael
recovers a year later, he displays
his undying (no pun intended)
gratitude by stabbing him to
death.

W/e’re then reunited with 45 9-
year—old protagonist, Jamie Lloyd

daughter and niece of the killer)
and her stepsister Rachel (Ellie

returns and supplies the comic
relief in a bizarre parody of his
Dr. Loomis character from the
original Halloween, 2 and 4.
Along the way we meet Rache1’s
gang of friends, four cardboard
cutouts who are obviously
introduced for no other reason
than to be mutilated later. A
psychic rapport is formed
between Jamie and Uncle Mike,
and she can see whenever he's
about to kill again. And again.
And again.

 $3 million, can hardly be

described as low. It would
probably even be scary in the
mildest sense if it were possible
to care about these laughably
illogical people.

As the ﬁlm’s heroine, 12-year-
old Danielle Harris is quite
convincing; but the same can’t be
said for the rest of the cast.
Pleasance, an acclaimed British
stage and screen actor, is
somewhat embarrassing to watch
as he is reduced to playing this
ridiculous character, walking
around half—crazed and crippled,
wheezing rehashed dialogue such
as “How many more will he kill?”
and “If that girl is killed tonight,
her blood will be on your hands!”

John Carpenter’s Halloween
was such an involving, eerie,
suspenseful, neat little
independent film, which is rare.
What’s more disturbing than the
repeated (and future) exploitation
of Carpenter’s original Halloween
is the exploitation of the 9-year-
old star's sheer terror as she is
relentlessly chased down by a
knife—wielding madman intent on
stabbing her to death. Watching
this cute little kid being chased

idea of fun, and the decision to
make her the film’s protagonist

In Pittsburgh/Stroh's 1989 Music Awards

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Billy Price wandered around
the borders of the stage at Graffiti
Tuesday night, a thick, triangular
glass award for BestAl‘bum of the
Year tucked under his arm. The
lipstick that had been on his
cheek when he accepted another
award, Best Rhythm and Blues
Band, was now wiped clean.

To him, the Fourth Annual In
Pittsburgh/Stroh’s Music Awards
had also wiped clean the slate

between local bands and music
fans. Just three years ago, most
bands were complaining that fans
did not appreciate their artistry
and that it was exceedingly
difficult to gather a sizeable
following and become more than
just a local act.

Times have changed. Billy Price
and the Keystone Rhythm Band
have become one of the most
popular acts in southwestern
Pennsylvania, and many other
bands are following in their stead,
as well as that of other established

Chris Frantz, Billy Price and Tina Weymouth at the In Pittsburgh/Strob '3 Music Awards.

bands.

“But it takes something like In
Pittsburgh to galvanize it,” Price
said, with his patented sunglasses
on even in the corners of the dark
hall. Price collected two of the 28
awards, the winners of which
were selected from a list of
nominees by 140 critics, writers,
club owners and industry experts.

Price may have been the big
winner, but the largest applause
of the night was saved for the
Affordable Floors, who garnered
Band of the Year honors.

Heidi White/The Pitt News

 

Other selections that were
obviously popular with the
standing room only audience
and a KDKA-TV viewing
audience included Joe
Grushecky as Best Vocalist (“That
probably comes as a surprise to
anyone who’s ever heard me
sing,” Grushecky said.); The
Clarks as Best Rock Band, with
“Thanks to Joan Kane” of \X/PTS—

FM; and the Flow Band, which
regularly plays Zelda's and The
Decade, as Best Reggae Band.

Chris Frantz
Weymouth of the Talking Heads
and Tom Tom Club awarded the
final honors of the evening to
Price and the Floors, noting that
these were not local, but ‘‘world—
class musicians.”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

When Marc Spindler came to
Pitt in 1987, he was a valuable
addition to an already excellent
defensive line, which included
Jon Carter, Burt Grossman and
Tony Siragusa. But being a
freshman, he also brought with
him hope for the future.

This year’s defensive line shares
a similar scenario. The top
veterans include Spindler,
Siragusa, Torn Sims and Carnel
Smith. The freshman securing the
future is Keith Hamilton. ,

Hamilton, the 6—foot-seven,
275-pound defensive end from
Lynchburg, Va., has already made
his way into the Panther starting
lineup. Hamilton leads the team
in sacks with seven and is tied for
the seventh leading tackler with
25. Eight of his tackles have
thrown opponents for a loss,
another team leading‘ statistic.

Even though it is rare for
freshmen to start, Hamilton didn’t
let that discourage him.

,“I didn’t rule out lstartingl,”
said Hamilton. “I came in with a
positive attitude, and I try to do
my very best and do everything
the coaches ask. I got a couple
breaks, and this is where I’m at
now.” ~

Despite being named Parade
Magazine All-American in his
senior year at Heritage High
School, Hamilton didn’t get that
much recognition as a top Pitt
recruit. Instead most of the
preseason recruit hype went to
the 1988 USA Today National
Defensive Player of the Year,
Sean Gilbert. Unfortunately for
Pitt, Gilbert was one of their
many Proposition 48 casualties.

. xx .\ \ . I P
Keith Hamilton (92) leads the Panthers in quarterback sacks (7) and is tied for seventh in tackles (25). an

However, Hamilton didn’t rninrl

that -Gilbert received most of the

media attention.

“I have no selfishness in my
heart. Sean is a great player, and
I’m sure he’ll. show that next
year,” said Hamilton. “To me,
press is good, but when things
are going bad, [they] all write bad
things about us."

The Pitt/Penn State volleyball game scheduled for this
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. will be more than just a great match—up
of rivals, featuring the 15th—ranked Penn State team against the
Pitt team which is pushing the top 20.

That’s not all, however, as it will also be the first production
of a television agreement between Pitt’s department of athletics

The agreement allows GTV Sports to produce Pitt’s non-
revenue sports and market the production for television. They
plan to program as many as four varsity events per month. In
addition to volleyball, the program will include soccer, baseball,
wrestling, men’s and women’s swimming, men’s and women’s
tennis, men’s and women’s track, women’s basketball and
men’s and women’s gymnastics.

“We have some outstanding varsity sports teams representing
the university,” said Dr. Edward Bozik, director of athletics.
“The production and airing of some of these varsity sports
events will afford these teams and athletes exposure that has

According to Pitt volleyball coach Sue Woodstra, the Pitt/

In Pitt’s 3 1 -1 4 victory over Navy
last Saturday, Hamilton recovered
his second fumble of the year.
The play didn’t stop with the
recovery, however, as Hamilton
scampered 68 yards_ for an
apparent touchdown. The referee
called the run back because he
said Hamilton’s knee was on the
ground when he picked it up.

With the halftime score just 10_—

7 in Pitt’s favor, the Panthers
were in need of a big break.
Hamilton supplied that break on
the second play of the third
quarter. Navy quarterback Alton
Grizzard was running an option
play, a common occurrence in
.Navy’s wishbone offense, and
when Grizzard went to pitch to
his running back, Hamilton
blocked the lateral, causing the
ball to roll toward the Pittsburgh

. end zone. Navy recovered, but

they lost 18 yards on the play.
“We came out [at halftime] ﬁred
up. They tried to run the option
to my side, and I just hit the ball.
We just got some good breaks;
he tried to ﬂip it, and I got my
hand in there,” said Hamilton.

Pitt’s next game is on Oct. 28,
against the top-ranked Notre
Dame Fighting Irish. Both teams
are currently undefeated, but Pitt
has been “sluggish and ﬂat” in
their last two victories, against
Temple and Navy, according to
Gottfried. Hamilton denies that
looking ahead to Notre Dame
had anything to do with their last
two performances.

“We’re just taking one game at
a time. Notre Dame is a good
team; we all know that, but we
have to go out and play against
the opposing team and execute,”
said Hamilton.
