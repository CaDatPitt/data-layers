Five years of service to the Uni-
versity and the University Y. M. C.
'A. will come to a close next week
when M. D. 5‘traney, secretary of the

general secretary of the “Y” in Se-
lina,‘ Kansas.

.An account of the many things
that Mr. Straney has promoted
since he came to the University has
been run in the news columns of the
Weekly. The list of achievements

is animposing one, and oneof which

country could-' well be proud of.
Too, Straney has been more loyal

of  duties have required.- .The
fact that many students believed
that he was a graduate of the Uni-
versity clearly indicates how closely
he has allied himself with Pitt ‘while
hcre.u ’
, His going, then, is like the going
of an alumnus; and although all re-
gret‘ ..it, all realize that with him.
 go the spiritof the University.
It is he if part of the campus "were
 ‘taken west of the Mississippi,

Being true Pittites, we‘ hope that
the new campus prospers with the
old. .

‘It" was good to see the losers of
the .cheerleading contest at Memor-
ial‘ Hall last Friday come around
back-stage and congratulate the win-
ners after. the results of the com-
pctition had been announced. The
cdntest has been close, as was indi-
cated by the hesitancy of the judges
in making a ‘ﬁnal decision; but -the
losers were heartily ‘sincere in con-
gratulating the victors. Besides the
thrill of victory, the winners should
 further satisfaction from the

our cavemenwould all be’ champion

would be experts at outrunning op-
posing.» track teams. A life-time of

The mantle of the Swami Yogon-

few months, has -now fallen on‘some-
one else. .It’s a she this time.’ And
this she, who will occupy the ros-
trum of Memorial Hall for thenext
few weeks, seems to be much, more
versatile than her predecessor. Coy-
ly enshrined in a somewhat asymet-
rical valentine, the" young lady offers
three thousand free seats to all and
sundry who wish to hear her.

If the Amalgamated ‘Button Hole

Maybe it’s not that bad, but look at H

the whimsical piece of red hot news
sent in tons. Of course,. they wanted
it onthe front page:

Lunches, soft drinks and sand-

wiches will be served at the “Y” Hut .

to students and freshmen before
football games, announces Jim God-
frey, famous “Y” chef.
twenty-cent lunches are being served
every noon,_' as well as sandwiches,

« We are eagerly awaiting the news
of the arrival of two’ boxes of Oh

More  350,000,000 incandescent lamps, witha. '
combined light of nine billion ‘candlcpower, make-

city streets, stores,
before.

and homes brighter than ever “

In bungalow or mansion; “workshop or, factory;
dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for;

poor illumination. .

"We have cheaper and better-
-lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for:
the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of

light with " the carbon-ﬁlament lamps of 1886,‘
now buys 16,200 candlcpower-hours of light with

the MAZDA lamps.

Not only more light,‘ but correctly applied light, is
' the order of the day. The electric: lamp, with its
ﬁamelcss yet highly concentrated light ‘source,’

lends itself ideally; to rcﬂcctors, shades, and screens.

It is contro1IedligVh4;——-safe light. And illumina-
tion becomes an exact science.

During college days and in after late,-cm-..¢».1;g1,t;
ing must ever be of paramount importance to the '

college man and woman. Good lighting is the
worthy handmaidcn of culture and progress.

Luck Changing

‘Change? Ofcoursc!

Such seemed to be the attitude of"
hundredsgof Pittites who ﬂoodedthe
office of W. Don Harrison, Dean’ of‘
Men, in an: effort ‘to have couijses.‘
changed during the last "two, weeks.
The course changing-.craze brought“.
to light manyregistration mistakes,
hundreds of amusing incidents and
thousands of alibis. Many of the-
requests, the Dean reports, were jus-y

 

eitample: _ _ . _ ,_
One serious—minded student, with
‘his thoughts on the higherthings of.

blushfuuy confessed I that he de-
sired this opening on? behalf -of his‘.
"best girl, (who, as an office worker,

‘has. all her afternoons occupied er;-»

‘ Another rather sleepy-eyed indi-

vidual“ cornplained that 8:30 "classes -

did not agree with’ hisconstitutionr
and, although he lived but four

luxury. 1 1 _ ,

, Another‘ sober request came from‘
‘a world‘-weary freshman who d_e-'_
sired to‘ get _rid of his late afternoon
classes, since’ he developed corns
from standing‘ up in‘ the street car
on his way home. in the. evenings.‘ ’

With‘ Welchin the line-up, Pitt
‘ showed a, marked improvement over
last'week’s play in battling, George-
town to a 6-6-tie in the.stAadium last
Saturday. The tie» not onlyupset
th'e- idope, which before * the game
favored Georgetown .5-4-,_ but also
gavé.Panther stock an impetus to-
ward‘ better‘ things. The _tie was ‘es-
pecially gratifying to Pitt: students

Allegheny last week and gives prom-
ise, of better“'events. . in the-__ other

‘ Another _ 5 source of »grati'ﬁcatioTi','
not ‘only tospectators but also to_ the
Pitt management, was the change in
weather conditions for the game.
With a heavy rain last _Friday night,
it’ seemed. that the jinx of rainy
Saturday afternoons would reinain
with the. stadium.‘ 'A Clouds Saturday
morning tended to uphold forecasts.
of rain and held down the crowd .to
17,500 spectators. _However, _the
weath.er.as_ well as Pitt hopes brigh-
teneclr-up--in~tlie afternoon and Old.
Sol even peeked a few times. to
glimpse‘ one of the ‘most thrilling
aifairs ever held in the stadium.
_.The- spectators as’ well as the
teams. were disappointed - that -nogjde-’
‘cision was reached. but the Panthers
-should’be' more than satisﬁed, since

A they were~'not’ev_en picked to tie the

 Although practice does not begin

already discussing the outlook for
the coming" tennis season, after last
year’s successes. As faras material.
is concerned, Dr. T- W. Stephens,
coach, has.no cause to worry as ms,

Klater, Barnes, Wunderdich, Wester-

outlook seems bright for a repetition

Probable‘ ‘Line-up For
Opener Against Kiski
' Announced. _

 

cAin.soN PESSIMISTIC

‘With two and a half weeks of prac-

 

 

-tice passed, the frosli ‘football team-

is beginning to take shape and" show
some form. Of course, even two and
a half weeks is a short" time to put
about 60 fellows together and pick
out a team that will function.. like
Pitt freshmen teams usually. do.
However, this year’s frosh will have

. to develop very fast in order to :conie

outwell in the face of the opposition
they are meeting, .Dr.A_ Carlson states.»

Prospectsat ﬁrst did not appear
very bright,’as the freshmen lacked
‘experience and had no camp train-
ing this year. .After. nightly prac-
tices and frequent scriininages
against the . varsity,’ thei team has
ﬁnally advanced to._the stagejwhere
they canaiford the‘ varsity lots of
opposition. The opening game with

an -unusually. heavy Kiski team will

more than test the yearlings. .-
Although thelid-lifter is less than
two weeks away, a deﬁnite: estimate
of the team and the lineup cannot
yet be made. However, from scrim-

Varsity cross-country“‘prospects do
notllook promising after the ﬁrst
-week's practice,- reports from the.
track house indicate. The gradua-
tion .of the famed Ted Corbett, cap-
Atainlast season; and of Eddie Pow-
ell; the failure of Captain-elect
George Kerr and Billy Howell to re-
turn to school; and the ineligibility
of Rob Roy, practically wiped out
‘the Panther varsity of last season:

A The only veterans left are Jimmy
Wicks, Woodward Adams and Bob
Marquis. , A '

Coach Shea’s task ‘of buiuding a
new hill-and-dale club has not been

men. who can “ﬁll the shoes of men
like Corbett, Howell, Kerr and. Pow-
ell'."; Marquis, who is probablyvtlie
best man on the teamat present,
was: alwaysa minute or so behind
Corbett and KA’err,,last year, and
*whAile it is possible ‘that hehas im-
proved some, it is not likely that he
will come up. to the form that ‘Kerr
and Corbett showed. Wood Adams
was._ usually the sixth Panther to
tinish on ‘the 1925 team and while
it is thought he will hang closeto
the‘heels.of Marquis, he will prob’-
ably be at least. a half to a full min-
ute in the rear.- Jim Wicks, an as-
pirant for the team for two years-,
and a member of the "1923 freshman
team, which placed third inthe In-

FOE HAS NEW LINE.

 

.Team Coached by Herb‘

lMcCracken' Has Good.
Record F o r Season;
Primed F or Pitt. '

Meeting Lafayette this Saturday
in the stadium, the Panther gri_d- -
ders continue with anotherhard op-
ponent, the second of, the series‘, of A
four encounters without a let-up. In
spite of .the marked-improvement the
Pitt team showed against George-

 

town, the visitors are favorites .;lI1

view of their scoring ability.in their
two opening games of the year.‘ ;

Lafayette will enter the game
ﬁghting to break Pitt’s record of not
losing to the same team three years
in" succession. Pitt _will strive" to
keep this record and at the same
time avenge last year's defeat, the
only one to mar Pitt’s record. Mc-
Cracken’s men defeated Pitt in 1924,,
McCracken’s ﬁrst year at Easton and.
Sutherland’s ﬁrst year at Pitt. _

Out of the six games played be-
tween these two institutions,ALafay-
etee has returned victor in four. Be-
sides" the yictories of the past two
years, Dr. Sutherland defeated his:
alma mater in 1921 and 1922 by
single touchdown margins each
game. In 1920, “Pop” Warner‘
coached Pitt to a 14-0 victory and-
in 1923 Pitt turned in- their only
other victory, 7-0, when Lafayette
ends let sure touchdowns slip
through their ﬁngers. ‘

To add to the features of the
‘game, the Lafayette band, which last
year received much favorable coin-‘
ment in Pittsburgh, will accompany
the team tomorrow when they leave‘
Easton. A large number of student
rooters as well as townspeople will
travel by rail and‘ by machine—"to'
yell" for their favorites. The local
Lafayette -alumni chapter is expect-
ed to attend the game in large‘ num-
bers and have already made‘ ar-
rangementsl for seats’. ' _ v,

ing the weight of the opposition.
