Students’ -Center
Opens 2 Tuesday
In Old Bimbo’s

BY SCOTT MACLEO_D

A student center equipped with a
stage for concerts and small theatre
productions will open Tuesday in
the old Bimbo’s across from the
Law Building site. Operational
funding for the center was granted
by Chancellor'Wesley W. Posvar.
Therenovated structure. which
now has a clean ' night-club
atmosphere. will be available for
use-by recognized student organi-
zations only. Two managers

working 12-6 pm and 6-12 pm shifts ’

‘will begin reservations
opening day.
“This building is not under the
normal constraints of Schenley [the
Student Union],” Dan Meloro,
Director of Student Activities
‘explained.

The biggest advantage to the new
system. Meloro said. was that the
Szabo Food Service does not have
to be used for catering. Students
will be permitted to bring in their
own food and beverages. he added.
without breaking any union pol-
icies.

The closing time is 2 am on
weekends and midnight on week-
days. one " hour later than the
normal Student Union hours.
Meloro also cited the privacy of the
new center as “a big plus for
students."

The building will be closed
Sundays, but Meloro said if the
demand is phenomenal, the policy
could be changed. He cited cost
reasons for the Sunday closing.

To reserve the center. which is
stillpunnamed. the student organi-
zation must contact a manager at
the center. 1

Before‘ using the facility. an
officer of the organization must

the insurance or simply by visiting
a staff gynecologist. According to
Kay Williams, nursing supervisor
who helped Health Service Director
Dr. Joanne Robinson develop the
new program, anyone seeking a
birth control device must go
through the new counseling-
oriented family planning program.

Students who attempt to avoid
this new system and simply make
an appointment with a gynecologist
to obtain birth control devices will
automatically be referred back to
the family planning program by the

physician.

“This is being done for the
students’ protection." said
Williams. “Students come in here

who have received a prescription

A for birth control pills from a doctor
’ back home.

11

Williams explained
that such students often develop
problems because every birth
control device isnot compatible to
every patient.

Any student participating in the
program must first go through a
counseling session. “Most of our
appointments are individual ones.
but we want to get to groups. We
feel group sessions might stimulate
more questions," Williams said.

She explained that the purpose
of the mandatory counseling was, to
educate the students -‘about -all

aspects of family planning, in- -

eluding birth control devices and

methods and all possible side“

effects. “Some ‘students were
coming to the gynecologists for
such devices and not asking any
questions and so the doctors
thought they didn’t have any
questions. As a result, students
were getting messed up.”
Students desiring birth control
devices must have a gynecological

birth control method selected,
including pills and intra-uterine
devices (lUDs).

The new program is not covered
by student health insurance.
Williams said. because family
planning services are considered
“routine type procedures and not
illnesses.” Williams feels that for
this reason routine gynecologist
visits will not be covered under
future health insurance plans.

The Health Service is urging

participation in the program,

including males. Williams said

\ »._‘‘Male studentsat Pitt seem to be

very aware of their responsibilities
in this area (birth ‘control and
family planning).”

For students who are interested
in simply learning more about the
program, Williams said. the
counseling is free. The Health
Service is also sponsoring a
coffeehouse January 17 to explain

In December Arrests

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Two University students
appeared in City Court Tuesday at
a hearing stemming from their
arrest by campus police last month
in Tower ' C. The I presiding
magistrate bound one student over
to the grand jury on an assault
charge and fined the other $50 for
disorderly conduct. .

The students’ charge of brutality
by the arresting officers _ pre-
cipitated the formation of a
committee to investigate’ the
accusations. The incident occurred
when the officers answered a
complaint from another resident
concerning a loud stereo on the
floor above her in the early
morning hours of December 1.

As the arrests were being made.
a scuffle reportedly broke out, and
the officers have contended they
were forced to defend themselves.
acting only in the line of duty. The
students alleged the policemen
used excessive force and brutality,
and on December 5, Vice-
Chancellor Alfred Moye of Student

Affairs announced the committee
established to examine the accusa-
tions.

The panel’s findings have not yet
been released, but sources close to
the investigation have intimated
the available evidence will ex-
onerate the officers in the eyes of
the committee. The city magistrate
disregarded the defendants’ al-
legations at the Tuesday hearing
and ruled in the policemen’s favor.

 Po. legislature proposal

BY MARC RUDOLPH

The Open College. designed to
create educational opportunities for
an adult student body, will be
introduced in the Pennsylvania
legislature next month.

The Open College will enable
veterans of the armed forces to
obtain college credit for work or
study during their tour of duty, said
Education Secretary John C.
‘Pittenger at a Pitt press conference
Wednesday.

“Twenty five to thirty thousand
people return from the armed
forces to Pennsylvania every
year." said Pittenger. “Pennsyl-
vania does not have a good record
of integrating them into academic

Open Co lege lntrodu

life."

“We will automatically enroll the
serviceman in the Open College at
the time of his enlistmentf‘; he
said.

The Pennsylvania Department of
Education will work closely with
the US Defense Department to
create the mechanism whereby
each enlistee is automatically
enrolled in the Open College at the
time of his enlistment.

The Open College, said Pitten-
ger, would be a counseling and
evaluating center which would
advise people how to pursue their
careers. Prospective students
would enroll in already existing
post-secondary institiutions.

“The Open College will not give
courses itself." Pittenger ex-
plained. “It will make use of
existing courses in existing univer-
sities. Only where institutions do
not offer or cannot develop
programs will the_Open College
create programs.“

The program will cost $700
thousand to operate the first year.
It will begin on a small scale.
limited to three as yet undecided
areas of the state, and enroll
several hundred students. .

Many adults participating in the
Open College may be in need of
ﬁnancial aid. Under the present
setup, only full time students are
eligible for PHEAA scholarships
and loans. Pittenger forsees a
change in this procedure to make
the part time student eligible for
PHEAA financial aid.

“We expect to draw those
‘bypassed’ because of poverty.
whether in the inner city or in
remote. rural areas,“ said Pitten-
ger. “We expect to enroll those
who cannot, because of geographic
isolation. jobs. or family schedules,
attend classes in the traditional
campus or university setting. And
we expect we'll attract those
persons whopwant to--or because of
economic necessity must--begin a
new career.”

Hess said people are buying the
toilet paper even before it’s put on
the shelves. Another problem
causing the shortage, said Hess, is
the ‘difficulty in storing large
enough amounts of toilet paper to
satisfy the , demands of every
customer.

A representative from Wiscon-

source of the toilet paper shortage
rumor. According to a CBS news

speculated the public decided toilet

   Discrimination

1“Editor:

~ We would like to see the Director

‘of Affirmative Action spend more

time working on the deplorable
situation which the University is in
vis a vis minorities/women. and
less time defending an indefensible

situation. (See Pitt News.
V November 28. 1973. and the
I University Times. November 29.

I _ 1973).

It is obvious that there are lots of

.:~ women at this university and that
' A black» minorities are represented.

?*‘The problems lie
1 women/minorities are and how

in where

they ‘are treated where they are.

' Most employed women are secre-

taries or librarians; most blacks are
in Black Studies or at the various

—. lowest entry levels in the univer-

sity. There are a few places" where
minorities/ women appear in re-
presentative groups such as educa-

.. tion, social work, etc., and none of

this may be attributed to the
Affirmative Action Director, but
rather reflects the status quo.
There are problems of institu-
tional discrimination in on-the-job
situations. where equal pay for
equal work does not apply, where
women are laid off and white males
are hired. where women dupli-
cating machine operators are
classiﬁed as clerks and male

duplicating machine operators are

classified as duplicating machine
operators.

There are situations in the
university in which the day or days
the supervisor (male) is out of the
ofﬁce. business goes on as usual.
but when (his) “assistant(s)"
(female) are out, things come to a
standstill until (she) returns. If the
Director of Affirmative Action does
not know of these situations, the
lack of knowledge is (his) fault, and
(he) should not speak of that of
which (he) does not know.

As one starts to move up the
numerous hierarchical ladders,
minorities/women begin to dis-
appear. With _the exception
perhaps of a few black deans and
administrators, and an acting
department head who is a black
woman, the absence of women and
minorities is very apparent. In the
club of persons who surround the

Chancellor when his high level
executive groups are in session,
how many women are there? How
many male “Senior Adminis-
trators” are assisted by women and
how many of those women would

be considered to be successors to ~

his job? How many men would be?
How many women are among those
elegible for that elite status of
membership “Senior Adminis-
trator”?

The EEOC should begin looking
at pay discrepancies between male
and female at the Administrative
Specialist levels and count the
number of minorities. It should
investigate those positions which

entail administrative duties. but
which carry faculty rank and
examine these against those

“professional” staff positions
which involve similar duties. It
should investigate the Chancellors
“conﬁdential" payroll. which is
outside both the normal staff and
faculty classification scrutiny. and
find out who is getting paid what
and for what duties. It should
examine the effect of the “$17,500
clause" which permits certain
fringe benefits to “staff" whose
salaries are at or above that level
but not those below that level.

Many women/minorities are
being interviewed for jobs pre-
viously closed to them, but not
many are being hired, because the
ones who have “competitive”
qualifications, as defined by the
white male establishment image,
are rare. We are in an era that
equates sameness with goodness,
instead of taking advantage of the
challenge and growth that diversity
can bring.

There is much to be done in this
University vis a vis minorities/
women, and the time and money
being spent on trying to make the
University “look good" when it is
still in such questionable standing
is pretty bad business.

consideration since GPSA was
organized (January 1972)

2. There will be a subcommittee

3. No other comment.

The rest of the reporter’s
comment was basically correct, but
the situation is definitely more
concrete then indicated in the

the proposal to join GPSA was
defeated at a SEC meeting. At the
first meeting in September 1973,
the proposal was reopened for
consideration due to new develop-

vote when the SEC has enough
information to make a decision in

Goldfish Culping

Dear Editor:

I am protesting the proposed
goldfish swallowing contest that
will be part of Student Government
and SUB's Nostalgia Week-End.
A traditional goldﬁsh swallowing
contest involves the gulping down
of live fish. These poor creatures
then die an incredibly agonizing
death by being drenched in
burning stomach acid. I don't think
it is too far out to assume that they
may be alive for five or ten seconds
after they reach the stomach. This
is an outrageous cruelty. It would
be wrong on principle to kill so
senselessly even if no suffering was
involved.

I urge the sponsors of Nostalgia
Week-End to drop this event.
Nostalgia be damned! There is
something wrong with this kind of

Pro-life

Dear Ms. Sexton,

The exchanges between
pro-lifers and the pro-abortioners
which have appeared in The Pitt

 

another.

the I

News last week produced a rather
novel observation by Roger
Johnson on the subject of murder.
Traditionally murder was con-
sidered a very serious thing. One
was justified to kill an individual
who would commit murder when
necessary to defend oneself or
Conviction of murder
often led to the murderer’s own
death.

Now, however, murder is only a
matter of belief. It has long been
held that another’s beliefs must be
respected, but we have lacked this
greater depth of understanding
which could have added a note of
serenity to otherwise unpleasant
moments in history. No doubt the
Vietnamese of My Lai would not
have been so terror stricken had
they only known that it wasn’t
really murder because Rusty and
Pual and the others really didn’t
believe they werehuman. And
how much easier it would have
been back home, at least for those

.of use who cared, had we only
known that My Lai was not a-

manifestation of evil, but only a
matter of belief. Thus we are saved
the necessity of either action or
concern by pure tolerance of
another’s belief.

In many ways the abortion
controversy bears the classic
features of tragedy. The values
sought to be realized by both
parties to this conflict are desirable
states of humanity. Perhaps there
is no possible synthesis of these
two sets of values. One would
hardly think so on the basis of the

irrationality. inanity and myopia

demonstrated by the proponents of
each. Perhaps not all has yet been

said. In any event, the resolution.
if there be one. will be a long time
coming. In the meantime, murder
seems far too awesome and terrible
a thing to be only a matter of belief
and if not. then not.

Very truly yours.

a_vailability of the drug.
This discovery has seen the rise
of many drug testing companies
which use human subjects.
Biodecision Laboratories, located
in the Webster Hall Hotel, is one
such company. Its president, Alan
Woodman, explained Biodecision’s
_function. “It wasn’t until three
years ago that scientists suddenly
discovered that all capsules of 250
mg. of the same drug aren’t the
same. Take two capsules. In a
laboratory test they both contain
250 mg. of the drug, but when
injected in the human body, 50% of
one might be absorbed, while
100% of the other might be
absorbed.“
Woodman stated that due to

, Federal Drug Administion (FDA)

regulations, “before a drug manu-
facturer can market his drug he has
to prove that his drug gets into the
bloodstream at the same rate as the
major brand. We were created out
of this.”

According to Woodman this
development will allow the Federal
Government to force doctors to
prescribe drugs by their generic
names. Woodman also stated that
now it is possible to prove that two
formulations are the same.

“There is competition in the
drug industry,” stated Woodman,
“the benefits of which (decreased
drug prices), are worth the risk of
using human beings in experi-
ments.

Dr. Mark Perkal, a chemist in the
Biodecision labs, said that the FDA
has set up three phases of drug
testing proceedure. Biodecision
operates within the third phase

which determines the different
_properties of the drug. According
to Dr. Perkal, when the drug
reaches Biodecision, in its ﬁnal
phase of testing, “the safety and
effectiveness have already been
established.“

Biodecision has run forty
studies, employing 709 volunteers.
The volunteers spend two week-
ends at the Webster Hall. Half the
group is given dosages of the
standarized drug, and half are
given dosages of the drug which is
being tested. This is reversed the
second weekend. Almost hourly,
blood samples are taken so that the
bioavailability can be determined.

‘Woodman stressed that the
Biodecision staff are “very
interested in our volunteers.”
Surveys are taken at the end of
each weekend to give the volun-
teers a chance to voice their

Truffaut Succeeds With ‘Film On Film’

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Francois Truffaut is always
giving a part of himself to movie
audiences. His first ﬁlm, The 400
Blows, was an autobiography of his
teen years. The later three
Isequels--Love at 20, Stolen Kisses,
and Bed & Board continually
revealed portions of Truffaut's life
through the character of Anton
Doniel, skillfully played by Jean-
Pierre Leaud.

Truffaut next conveyed his deep
admiration for Alfred Hitchcock
through theﬁlms--The Bride Wore
Black and The Mississippi Mer-
maid, both of which were directed
using Hitchcock’s movie-making
techniques.

Now Truffaut is letting movie

audiences share with him the
problems, triumphs, pressures,
and fun in making a movie in his
new film, Day for Night. In the
film, Truffaut plays a director,
Ferrad, who is shooting a movie
called Meet Pamela.

During the filming of Meet
Pamela, technical problems, frus-
trating retakes, ﬁnancial pres-
sures, and small personal victories
as well as crises develop.

The private lives of the ﬁlm crew
unravel and interact. There is a
has-been actress (Valentina Cor-
tese) whose son is dying of
leukemia. As a result, she can’t
concentrate on her lines and
thereby causes anguishing retakes.

The crew gets upset when the

members emphatically states‘, “I’d

BY ROSS HARRISON
Editor's Note:
General Matthew Bunker

Ridgway was the commanding
general of the 82nd Airborne
Division during World War II, and
parachuted with his troops into
Normandy in 1944. He succeeded
General Douglas MacArthur as
Supreme Commander for the allied
powers in the Far East in 1951, and
in. 1952 he ’ succeeded General
Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme
Commander in Europe. In 1953 he
was appointed Chief of Staff of the
U.S. Army.
* * * * *

Soon after my initial greeting
with General Matthew Bunker
Ridgway in his Fox Chapel home, it
became evident that he was ‘quite
willing to express his views on
issues of,current American military
and foreign policy.

General Ridgway is concerned
about the role which the United
States plays in the world today, and
how that role has changed since the
Korean War.

The replacement of the former
draft system with the ‘new
volunteer army, put many students
who reached the draft age during
the Vietnam War at ease, but
greatly disturbs General Ridgway.
He feels that by principle every
American Youth lucky enough to
enjoy the afﬂuent life most of us
enjoy in this country today has the
obligation to serve in the defense of
this country.

“My firm belief is and always
has been that every young person,
both man and woman, has the
obligation to contribute to the
defense of-, this country which has

A unparalleled opportunities for its

people. It has benefits that no

. other country in the world has ever

e11_.l0)’ed-” He also said that,
“There is a certain segment of
wonderful youngsters, both men
and women who will volunteer and
do, but not in sufficient quanti-
ties.”

- In light of the volunteer army,
equal concerns of General Ridgway

are the. lack of skilled soldiers

needed to operate. the complex
weapons which the armed forces
have now; "and the possible
i_n_ability'of"the United States‘ to
r'neet’the 40, some treaties she has

, with foreign ‘countries.

'-“In the «modern technological

‘age in which we live, the weapons

are so complex and require so
many skills to employ them
properly, that you just can’t take a
high school dropout, or a youngster
that has never even been to high
school and hand him one of these
weapons and expect him to be able

- to get the optimum out of it--except

 


"ﬁg :

g

 

I after long periods of training.

!7

In
light of the treaty obligations which
the United States has, General
Ridgway continued, “We still have
these obligations by bi-lateral and
multi-lateral treaties with over 40
nations around the globe, and you
never know when one of those

l.O.U.'s are going to be called and
we are going to have to meet
them."

General Ridgway said that the
army gets the brunt of
hardships and casualities, thus
making the army the\least popular
of the three branches of the armed
forces. He feels that voluntary

enlistment will leave the army
deficient. “In the Korean War, the
Army and the Marines together
bore 97% of the casualities of the
war. This is one great reason why
you won’t find people clamoring to
serve in the combat arms.”

The role that the army plays has
often been controversial. "General
Ridgway perceives the army as
occupying the same role in the
world today, as it did when he
commanded. “There is no
difference in the role the army
plays. The fundamental role of the

army is to obey .whatever lawful,
the

orders it receives from’
Commander in Chief, the Presi-

which the President law.fully

- appoints (such as the Secretary of

Defense), and to be prepared to
conduct large scale operations on

the P

or from those'individualss

land for indefinite duration against
any first class foe."

With Watergate and the lack of
credibility in government, there is
a possibility that a commander
would refuse to fight a war because
of personal morality. General
Ridgway sees this as a remote
possibility, but as a possibility
nonetheless.

The military commander would
always have the option ifvit (war)
violated his conscientious convic-
tions to a certain point to say, ‘I'm
sorry, here is my commission, you
have my resignation. I cannot

carry out any such‘ order.”’_

General Ridgway stated that the’
American Civil War offered the
only example in our military history
of such actions; “General Robert
E. Lee was calledlin by President
Lincoln and offered command’ of

the Union armies.

the offer, resigned his commission
in the United‘States Army‘, and
went‘ and led the armies of the
Confederacy.”

General Ridgway expanded on
this issue of resignation, and said

It was ' his .
.conviction_that.h_is loyalty ran to the .
State of Virginia. So. he declined

Friday, January 11, 1974"—‘rHEflP1TT, NEWS—-P'a‘ge‘ 7

Ridgewoy: Old General On New Problems   

that the resignation of former
Attorney General Elliot Richardson
is an example of such action
outside of the military arena.
“President Nixon ordered, so
we're told, his Attorney General,
Mr. Richardson to discharge
Archibald Cox, and Mr. Richardson
having promised Cox liberty of
action under certain conditions,
which Mr. Nixon himself is
reported to have approved, decided
as his own conscientious convic-
tions that his would be breaking a
promise he had made and a
committment he had made. A He
declined to do it and resigned.”
Since the Nixon Administration
came into office less than 5 years
ago, there has seemingly been a
detente between the United States
and the Soviet Union. General
Ridgway feels thatany effort on the

part of the Soviet Union to reach a _
detente with the United States is
totally for selﬁsh interests. He also‘

feels that the basic objectives of
theSoviet Union have not changed.
“Therelis not one shred of
evidence to show to date that there
has been any change in the
fundamental objective of the
‘leadership of the Soviet Union.

"They still cling in their public

utterances by top officials to their
purpose of communizing the
world.”

The General continued,
don’t have to go back very far. You
have the examples of Hungary in
.1956 and Czechoslovakia‘ in 1968.
There is ‘no shrugging off the fact
that the Soviet Union has the
capability of doing that again,
anytime they want. to any other of
the Western European nations.”

‘General Ridgway feels that the
‘people of the United States delude
themselves if they think that the
_motives of the Soviet Union are
anything else but selﬁsh.

‘Since World War II, the United
States has been‘ entangled-in the
Korean and Vietnam wars.
General Ridgway sees the military
tactics in the Vietnam war as
distinctly different from those

.employed in the Korean War.

According to General Ridgway, the
difference is that during the

“You

2.1’, . -~ 

\

Vietnam War, “The ,main thing
was that you couldn’t identify your
enemy most of the time. Half of
the population was extremely
hostile, but seemingly friendly; in
other words, they were just
peaceable peasants during the day
time and’ at night they got their
weapons out and you were subject.
to attack at every vulnerable
point.” However, in the Korean
War, the opponent ‘was a
thoroughly organized and identi-
fiable enemy.

During the Korean War, General
Ridgway spent much of his time in
Korea. and many times rode in an
open jeep. “Personally I was all
over Korea during the periods of
the most active combat in an
un-armed jeep only with one
following jeep with my little
personal security group of about 3
men. I was never shot at on the
ground and I could have been
assassinated a thousand times. and
would have been if I would have
attempted any such thing in
Vietnam. I'm sure." -

Before I left General Ridgway’s
house, he proudly showed me ﬂags

he had received. which represented 2.

all the commands which he held.

The impression that I left with
was that this man was one of the
greatest military leaders in our
history, but also that he considered
the moral implication of all actions
he took. Before resigning as Chief
of Staff in 1955, General Ridgway
wrote a letter to the Secretary of
Defense. in which he reviewed the

moral implications of themilitary‘. _

“I should like to add a word on
the importance of the moral factor
in all human relationships. es-
pecially when preparing a strategy
to protect America's security....
We find....the increasingly signi-
ficant ignoring by our planners of
the consequences of omitting the

moral lfacotr in considering the use

of the immense destructive capa-
bility which now exists in the
world. There is a responsibility on
everyone or us to evaluate this

moral factor, along with all the

scientific and other practical factors
in seeking solutions to these
mammoth problems.”

Woodman stressed that the volun-
teers are usually satisfied with the

But a few weeks ago. according
to Anthony Eek, a Biodecision
volunteer and Pitt student, the
volunteers petitioned Biodecision,
threatening to quit the experiment
if they did not receive more money.

Woodman stated that a. $150 pay
level was established by the Peer

dent ethics board appointed by the
company. Woodman said that the
committee “feels too high a fee
would crowd thejudgment of the
volunteers." Hefurther explained
that if too high a fee was offered,
men might respond to Bio-
decisi0n's advertisement without
fully considering what they were
getting into.

Woodman has raised the fee to
$200, but the petitioners are not
eligible for that increase. “We
can’t raise the fee during ‘the
study,” said Woodman.

Host Duke Tomorrow

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR
Following an 82-78 loss at West
Virginia, the Pitt basketball team
has errupted for 11 straight
victories, their best start since the
1929-30 season.
The Cats picked up their first

  victory of the season on a forfeit,

leading Rutgers 36-21 when a

demonstration ended the game.
The Steel Bowl at the Civic

Arena was next, and when Buzz

Ridl’s charges rolled over
Duquesne, 82-65, people began to
beheve.
82-60 victory over Florida State the
next night gave Pitt its first silver
cup since 1963.

Billy Knight, senior All-
American candidate, is having
another fine season. He scored 55
points and snared 22 rebounds in
the two games of the Steel Bowl to
win the most valuable player
award.

Villain
To H ero

BY RON SIEGEL
. ' SPORTS EDITOR

 

If Buzz Ridl was a vindicative man, he could spend his leisure time
laughing in the face of the many critics who were calling for his head at
the end of last season. After a 12-14 campaign, many predicted that
Ridl would not survive the present season.

- Not only has Buzz Ridl stuck around for the new year, but he may
become coach of the year by the time the season ends. Following an
opening season loss to West Virginia, Rid1’s cagers have realed off 11
straight wins, including six on the road.

Pitt has not cracked the nation’s top twenty yet, but it’s only a matter
of time before the Panthers get the recognition they deserve.

Last year’s villain has not changed his inannerts any now that he is a
hero. “There are times in every coach’s career when people are going
to be calling for your job,” he stated at the Charlottesville, Va. airport,
where his Panthers had just become the first non-ACC team to win
since 1969.

There are several reasons why Pitt has been unable to crack the
national ratings, and while Ridl will point them out, he is in no way
bitter when he discusses the subject.

The UPI Poll has space on the ballot for only ten teams, although the
top twenty are listed in the results. “If you’re not in the pre-season
rankings, you haven't got much of a chance,” explained Ridl.

Another problem with the ratings systems 1 according to Ridl, is that

D the voters don’t have time to examine the records of surpriseteams,

like Pitt, unless they happen to be on their schedule. “I voted when]
was at Westminster,” he recalled, “and I just looked at how the top
twenty did during the week and moved them up and down the ballot.”

The rankings don’t seem to concern Ridl that much. He is more
concerned with winning each upcoming game, and after another
surprisingly easy- win, looks on to the next one.

Explaining the team’s turnabout isn't simple. The only new addition
to the squad is ‘junior college transfer Lew Hill. Hm has played
excellently, but it’s not one man that has turned things around_

Assistant coach Fran Webster says that the team isldoing a lot of
things a little bit better, and that’s why Pitt is winning. From the
reaction of opposing coaches. though, one thing sticks out above all
others, and it’s not Billy Knight, who is having a great year.

Pitt has perhaps the most complicated defense in the country, and it
has taken the team until now to master it. What the defense does is

repeatedly shift from a 1-3-1 zone to a man-to-man, with many
variations. The shifts can be made by either the bench or any of the
players on the floor.

The results of this defense are amazing. Teams bringing the ball up
court don’t know what to expect. It is most apparent on teams with
young guards, like Duquesne and Virginia. A freshman Virginia guard
was bringing the ball up court, and just stopped and looked over at his
bench, not knowing what‘ he should do.

“It’s the same defense we ran last year,” explained Webster. “The
players understand it more and believe in it more.”

Another reason why the defense works so well is versatility.
Although Pitt has no big man this year, it has Kirk Bruce, a 6-4 guard,
and Keith Starr, also a guard, who is 6-5‘/2 and still growing. As a
result, there are times when Pitt can make any switch in defensive
coverage and not lose much height.

The team’s shooting percentage is over 50%, which is excellent.
The addition of Willie Kelly and Greg.McBride from last year’s junior
varsity squad has also helped.

The biggest reason why this close-knit team is winning is that
everybody in the lineup has mastered that complicated defense, and
the opponents haven’t. _ .

And Buzz Ridl, the hero on campus to replace Johnny Majors and
Tony Dorsett for at least the winter, is proving that a nice guy who
doesn’t ride all over the officials can win a helluva lot of basketball

games. Pre-season hopes for Bill Knight's senior year centered on the.

NIT. That would be a letdown now, because those who have followed
the team closely are talking nothing but NCAA.

llllIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllIllllIllllllllllllllllllllllﬁ

Knight was also named to the
All-Tournament Team, ‘as was
junior college transfer Lew Hill,
who scored 33 points.’ Mickey
Martin did not make the All-
Tourney Team,
thought he should have. The 6-5
forward scored 25 points and got 18
rebounds.

The Panthers carried a 3-1 record
into their first home game, against
Cornell on December 10, and
coasted to a 90-55 victory over one
of the weaker teams on the Pitt
schedule.

that's what the cagers did, and
they came home with two more
victories and the Razorback

Trophy, with Knight again winning
the MVP award, scoring 57 points.
Martin joined Knight in being
selected to the All-Tourney team.

The Cats spent New Year's Day
in Charlottesville, Va., preparing
for their game with Virginia the
following night. In perhaps their
toughest test of the season, the
Panthers became the first non-
conference team to defeat the
Atlantic Coast Conference Cava-
liers since 1969, winning 81-70.

Virginia there last season were 
Clemson, North Carolina. Mary- A-

The Cats returned home to a .. '55

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Just prior to his team’s first
meet, a guy came up to rookie
Gymnast head coach lg Perez to
offer congratulations. He also tried
to offer some unwarranted‘ specu-
lation.

“With all the freshmen you got,"
this fellow told Perez, “you guys
ought to start winning right away.
Johnny Majors did it!"

lg, about as unstereotyped a
coach as can be found, didn't
answer. He just started chasing
the guy down the Trees Hall
hallway. That guy might still be
running, but Perez stopped in time
to take his team through its first
two meets, both losses. and this
Saturday afternoon the Gymnastics
team will host’Penn State at Trees
Hall, at 2:00 p.m. Perez calls it the
annual “psysche-out".

Chances for a Panther upset are
dim, but it should be the most Penn
State has had to cope with in quite
some time.

Judging by the way the
Gymnasts have performed in their
first two losses, it seems logical to
assume that this down-trodden
program is on the up. The new
optimism is reasoned by Perez's
four freshmen recruits, a couple of
returning men, and improved
overall team morale.

Against the perennially 1 loaded
Nittany Lions, Perez will use those
factors and throw everything he's
got to put on a show. Robert
Pasterik, perhaps Perez's most
advanced freshman all-around
man, will team with his two first
year counterparts--Don Stevenson
and Gus Papantonio--in the all-
around positions. Team captain Ed
Swerdlow and Mark Boyette, and
possibly Tom Biers, will perform
the floor exercise. g

Stevenson, who suffered a
shoulder injury last week on his
way to finishing third all-around
against Springfield College, might
not be ready for Saturday. In that
case‘ Larry Hahn, another fresh-
man, might see action. Cliff

Custer,  Strahler, and Jim
Kolesar will do the rings and Carl

Bell and Gary Woolf will ride the_
‘ pommell horse, along with the

three all-around men. The high
and parallel] bars will be shufﬂed
among Kolesar and Hahn.

During the Christmas vacation.
the Gymnasts fared well--
considering the circumstances--
while losing 152.0 to 129.5 to
Massachusetts. Last year’s best
score was 132. and that by a team
of seniors.

Perez's troops suffered some bad
luck against Springfield as Pasterik
was hurt in the first event and was

Resume

Following a long Christmas
layoff. Pitt's winter sports teams
resume action this weekend.
Besides the basketball team, Pitt's
gymnastic team will be at home on
Saturday while the wrestlers.
swimmers, and indoor runners will
be on the roa_d.

Coach Dave Adams‘ wrestlers
see their first meet action in a
month this Saturday when they
travel to Annapolis, Md. for a
four-teani contest with Princeton,

Oklahoma. and Navy. The
Panthers have lost to powers
Michigan, Michigan State, and

Oregon State and the schedule
doesn't let up. But veteran George
Bryant (118). who was third in the
Easterns last year, returns to the
squad after a term ofpacademic
difficulty. Bryant, Keith Nellis and
Rande Stottlemyer will be Pitt's
starters inlthe 118 and 126 slots.
Stottlemyer's 3-1 record is the best
of the trio.

In the other divisions,
sophomore Bob Bailey will wrestle
at 134 and either Ron Selfridge and
Bill Renton, two freshmen, will ‘go

unable to continue at top form.
Pasterik is healthy now. Spring-
field defeated the Pitt Gymnasts
152.85 to 119.95.

In gymnastics, when you lose by I '

a couple of points you lose by a lot.

So where's the optimism in those .

two whopping Pitt defeats? When
considering that last year a team of
seniors could perform in the 120's,

and when also considering the p’ C’

amount of time it takes to learn the
very complicated routines,
year's freshmen haven’t done bad.

Pitt’s defense held the potent

with no further scoring. it became
apparent that Fiesta Bowl III would

The two teams exchanged punts

exchanged interceptions to start
the second. Daniels had a pass
