Because there is no shortage of
commissioned oﬂicers in the United
States army today, no change will
be made in the personnel of the
University military department or
in its procedure ofinstruction, Col-
onel. Edward Kelly, professor of
military science and tactics, reveal-
ed today. " #1

A clause in the constitution of
Scabbard and Blade, national hon-
orary military society, states that
the society will be discontinued in
case of a declaration of war. But
the organization will not disband
and will continue in its ‘present
form. This policy was decided
upon by the national headquarters

, of the society and made ‘known to
all the chapters. ,
Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military
fraternity, will continue in its pres-
ent state. . /

Col. Kellysa-id that conditions
are vastly different from 1917
when there was an acute shortage
of officers which necessitated the
turning of the‘_U‘niversity into an

V/as.Caught Asleep 

By‘ EDGAR BEIGEL
Far ‘Eastern Air Raid Warden

As of Wednesday evening, the
great Hawaiian air'.raid. mystery
wasstill unsolved.

The ﬁrstlreaction was that “the l

army was. caught napping. (lt ap-
pears the matter may never be
completely explained until after
the war.) "

From dispatches filed before
Honolulu correspondents were shut
up, and from sources in the Uni-
versity familiar with the? Pearl
Harbor military geography, this
seems to be the most likely explana-

A tion: *

Aln attack by about A 70 four-
motored bombing planes, dive-

bombers, and torpedo - carrying ,

planes took place between 7:55
and 8:30 last Sunday morning.

The planes came from an air-
craft carrier that had steamed east
of the islands, and early Sunday
morning ‘launched its load of
planes.

To have discovered this carrier
would have required a naval air
patrol ‘covering about 650,000
-square‘ miles, for which at least
160 huge four-motored flying boats
would be necessary. Our sources
do notbelieve even approximate-
ly this; number was stationed at
“Hawaii. I i » « ‘

Thus a surprise l,bombardment'

was iinpossible to stop before it
began. After it began-—i.e..,’when
the Japanese planes neared the
islands, they were covering ‘prob-
ably about ﬁve miles a minute.

DefenselGroup Asks
Students to Register

Pitt students were requested to-
day to register in the Civilian De- ~
fense Volunteer Service.

Miss Elena Gage, head of the .«

service, said that students may

register in office 501 City-County

building between 10 o'clock in the

morning’ and‘9 o’clock in the even- -
ing on week days and from 10 to

3 on Saturdays.

Trained registrars will interview
each person -to ﬁnd‘ what type of
home defense work he is best quali-
ﬁed for. At present there are more“
positions open to women, but all
students, women and men, have

teers- to

The pnly way such planes could:
have been, stopped dead by anti-._,
aircraft guns .w‘ould have required‘
gunners to be ready to shoot when;

the planes were sighted. ‘ln.-tlro,‘ 

confusion of the attack, the; 

wave of planes was probably 

the islands before guns could, be
sighted. ' ll 

. But this explanation does, noth- ,

ing to clear up the matter‘ of dam-
. age. The White House said the
battleship Oklahoma capsized, a
destroyer was blown up, planes on
the groundwere destroyed, and a.
number of warships were damaged.

I-

' Speaking in Bryn Mawr Sunday a

night, Vincent Sheean, who return-
ed from Hawaii only 48 hours be.
fore the attack, said, . “American
warships lay side by side alongside
the harbor, an easy target for enc-
my bombers.” 5
The United Press reported “the
American ﬂeet . steamed out of
-Pearl Harbor shortly after the at-
tack by planes which skimmed over
the hillsand were upon the naval
base before they were detected.”
(They were ﬂying in the sun, com-‘
ing from the east.) ’
The ironical part of the Hawai-

ian air raid mystery is the story”;
that the citizens of Honolulu took”
to the hills, believing themselves‘.

OF Freshmen

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean oi
the College, revealed today that
“more than half of our present
freshman class are A students.”

The college stands especially
high because it includes students

preparing to enter theschools of a

medicine, law, education, and other
professional schools which have
high qualiﬁcation standards, he
said. y
Ranking second among schools
with large freshmen classes of
1,006 or more, where use is made
jof the machine scored edition of
psychological tests, the Pitt fresh-
man class recorded a new scholas-

tic high in a quintile analysis.

New records are being establish-
ed by freshmen at the off-campus
centers «at Johnstown and Eric.

4 The Johnstown unit has an even
51 per cent in the upper quintile,
whereas the Erie center’: percent-
age roaches 59.4.

Fifty-one and
cent of freshman students now
come from the upper ﬁfth of their
high school graduating classes, ac-
cording, to a survey made by J. G.

By Norman Marcusiand Herb Reingold

Foremost among the new releas-
es this week is Sammy Kaye's love-
ly arrangement of “The White
Cliffs of Dover.” It consists of a
softly modulated orchestra, choral
singing and an Arthur Wright
tenor solo. “Madelaine," on the re-
verse, is also a war ballad. . . .

If you haven't heard Harry
James’ version of that swell new
ballad, “Make Love To Me,"
you're really missing something.
Helen Forrest sings a super vo-
col that really sends you. This
number is going places. Discmate
is "You Don't Know What Love
Is." (Oh, yeah.) . . .

At last Tony Pastor has record-
ed his beautiful theme song “Blos-
soms.” Some real schmaltzy tenor
saxing is featured by Tony. ,Re-
verse is “Get Happy.” So-what . . .

Earl "Father" Hines comes
through this week with the ever-
popular “I Got It Bad and That
Ain't Good," played and sung no
the Dulce would have it. Discmnte
is “Straight to Love," a plain pop-
tune. a 0 o

MUSICAL EDITORIAL:

Quite a few students have asked
us what is the sense of listening
and following popular r- music

trends? They claim that popular ,

music is undermining the classical

style of music. It is our opinion

that the popular music of today is
but a stepping stone to the higher
musical plaxfe. "

The rapid ballad and jump-tune
lovers of today will blossom forth
into intelligent, well-bred and far-
sighted listeners of classical mu-
sic. We do not say that» popular
music will [die out. On the con-
trary it will become even more
beautiful than it is today. The
generation will change but not the
music.

MUSICAL COMMENTS:

This morning’s mail brought us
a letter from our good friend Glenn
Miller. We wrote to. Glenn asking
him why he does not play his super
arrangement ‘ of “Swing-Low,
Sweet Chariot."

The answer is that quite a few
people think it is sacrilegious to

swing this ballad. However we are .;

When Mr. 

not of that opinion.
Miller records his arrangement of
,"Swing Low," we promise you
one of the best records of all time.
it is really unbeatable. \\

SONG OF THE WEEK:

Inspired by the world crisis, the 
very lovely “The White Cliffs of 

Dover," is sweeping the country
and is bound to pick up our morale.
This song touches the heart so ten-
derly that you feel like having a
good cry on the nearest cockney’s
shoulder. . . .

’Roof area, in cases of air-raid,
is the most important factor of a
building's vulnerability.
Although the Cathedral is built
high, its roof area is very small.
The building itself is very strong.
Constructed of very heavy steel,-

is hard to make on a tall narrow

he’s none other than Dr. John Max-

of economics at Pitt.

“Fergie,” as he is fondly called
by students and faculty alike, was
born and raised in Florida where
he received his education through

Although_ deeply interested in
music, Dr. Ferguson—feltfthat there
would be “no living in that ﬁeld”
for him.

After Columbia D15’, Ferguson

returned to Germany and worked,
on his traveling fellowship at the _

‘ Leipzig university, (receiving, his
doctor's degree at the unusually
early age of 22. ‘_ _ _ _
Then for two, years Dr. Fergu-

son taught ‘at Vassar college be-

fore coming to Pitt, where he will
celebrate his ﬁfteenth year in June.

During World War I he ﬂew a

plane until an accident resulted in

a broken back. After the war, he

played baseball as third baseman

for the New York Giants for a

short time. "

With four books to his credit,

and the other on economics, called
“Landmarks of E c o n o m i c

A volunteer student‘-ambulance
corps, preliminary to a complete
program of air-raid protection for
Pitt, will be organized by Dr. H.
C. Carlson, director of the Men’s
Health service, in the very near
future. In preparation,f'or any pos-
sible exigency, air-raid drills will
be conducted shortly after the or--
ganization of this corps.

Although Dr. Carlson has not
yet revealed a deﬁnite date when
this plan will go into effect, it is
expected that a form will appear
in the Pitt News next week to
facilitate volunteering.

The ambulance corps, which will
serve the school and the student
body, will consist of two sections,
foot or litter transportation, and
motor transportation. All Pitt stu-
dents, faculty members, and em-
ployees are eligible for member-
in the ambulance service.
Those who come to school regular-
ly with cars may join the motor
transportation service.

Automobiles, according to the
plan, will carry victims from first-
aid stations to hospitals. Drivers
will be assigned definite parking
stations and will exhibit a special
insignia. Station wagons and se-
dans will be especially desirable
for patients who are able to sit
upright. Cars adapted for prostrate
patients also will be needed.

The Cathedral district will be
zoned. A leader and two assistants,
who live in the Oakland district,
will be assigned. to each of the four
main entrances. In case of an air
raid, casualties will. be taken by
foot to the first-aid station in the
Cathedral. The injured from other
University buildings will go direct-
ly to a hospital.

The emergency room, which may
be the Commons room or the Ca-
thedral gym, will be directed by
doctors, su1'geons, and graduate
nurses. The School of Medicine will
train volunteers to give other than

‘ technical attention.

Because mere knowledge or as-
signment is not sufﬁcient, drills
will be necessary. “There must be
no levity in the matter,” said Dr.
Carlson. “Due to the seriousness

“It is to be hoped that students
will be prepared to go beyond the
stage of conversation into the
actual mechanics of doing some-
thing,” remarked Dr. Carlson.

.Card With Wildcats

The first actual test as to wheth-

son's pre-season enthusiasm has
bﬁen justiﬁed or not will take place
I‘-week from Saturday night, when

, the Blue and Gold cagers invade

the den of the Northwestern Wild-
cats invthe current season's inaug-
ural game.

Northwestern's floor mentor, Ar-
vﬁhur “Dutch" Lonberg, has been
anything but optimistic about the
coming campaign. Graduation took
'two men from last year's team and
the army air corps took two more.
However, six experienced men
have returned, but this has failed
to lift the spirit of their coach.
.1'.At this writing the first team

consists of two veterans and three
rookies. The vets are captain Hen-

’ ry Clason and Russ Wendland, both

guards. Sophomore sensation Otto
Graham, Bobby Jake.andATed Es-

_. self/make up the rest of the start-
ing quintet. Clason was high scor-

or‘ for the Wildcats last year as he

, rung up 105 points.

able to make a trip to Florida

mas vacation. Using it as a pre-
season tune-up session, coach Ben
Grady would like to see the Pitt
boys in action against some top-
flight competition.

December 20 to January 1, inclu-
sive. Like the football and baseball

clinics, this swimming meet is an

ference in years, Graham upheld
his advance notices by playing top
notch ball last year. He has been
coach Lonberg’s only source of en-
thusiasm thus far this year.

Last year Lonberg’s proteges
were rated good defensively, but
this year they are supposed to have
a strong scoring punch, with a
good  acking. The Wild-
cats were we of the six teams to
beat the Panthers last season for
they won 49-29. That Pitt will be
out to avenge last year’s loss goes
without saying.

This will be the ﬁfth meeting of
the two teams, both having won
two games. Thus this year’s con-
test is the rubber game of the
series.

The stadium ice cream eaters
will. put their new “oscillatory of-
:f.’ense” into _ operation against
Northwestern, and the outcome of
that game and the following game
with Butler two days later will
give some indication as to how
good or bad it is.

The starting live for the Jun-
glecats remains the same as it has
been all through the practice ses-
sions, with Tay Malarkey jumping
center, co-captains Eddie Ziolkow-
ski and Larry Paffrath at the for-
wards, and Bobby Artman and
Jimmy Egan at the guard posts.
Steve Shuber and Walt Jones are
the first reserve men and continue
to press hard for a starting posi-
tion.

Last Saturday. Carlson got some
good news from Ziolkowski who
was granted a six month draft de-
ferment. However, the sudden
outbreak of the war may cause the
Ambridge draft board to change
its mind again. Time alone will
tell whether “Ziol" will be allowed
to keep his deferment or must en-
ter the service before the termina-
tion of the season.

"All Basketball
Entries Due A
Today"-—Potts

“There will be a red hot ﬁght
in the independent basketball loop,"
said James Potts, director of In-
tramural athletics last Wednesday
afternoon after viewing the num-
ber of independent entries that
came into the office at the last mo-
ment.

Mr. Potts continued by saying,
“We will give the independents one
more chance to bring their entries

»up to my oﬂice for after today it

will be too late."

There has been a number of new
teams entering the independent
competition this year and in addi-
tion to the old standbys, a banner
year is expected.

The Eagles, Faculty Club Boys,
AC, and Amity Club have al-
ready sent in entries. All of these
groups, with the exception of the
Amity club, are new to the intra-
mural circuit. The YMCA and Bus
Ad aggregations are expected to
enter once again for they have not
missed entering for the past three
years. :

Probably one of the most colorful
quints in the independent circuit
will be the Faculty Club Boys made

For Panther Tracksters

With warm-up sessions in full
swing, Coach Carl 0lson’s Blue
and Gold indoor track squad are
rounding swiftly into shape for the
diﬂicult schedule that lies before
them for the current cinder cam-
pain.

Although the Panther aspirants
are heading into their second week
of practice drills, they have not
yet started to work on individual
events. The Jungle Cat indoor can-
didates are devoting most of their
time to loosening up and getting
into good physical condition. As
yet, no “charley-horses” or other
leg ailments have been reported
which is a good indication that the
Panther mentor is bringing his
boys up slowly but surely.

The probable card that is in

_ store for the Olsonmen is not of

a pushover type. It is one that is
indicative of “tough Panther sched-
ules.” The Boston A. C. meet, Mil-
rose, the ‘IC4A, Central 'Inter-col-
legiate and the Butler Relays at In-
dianapolis. This is only a tentative

slate which as yet does not have.

any official conﬁrmation. However,
there is a great possibility for a
campaign of this nature because
all of these meets were attended by
the locals in past years. V ~

Perhaps, the two most important
of these contests are the IC4A-

classic at Madison Square Garden
in New York and the CIC meet
held in South Bend, Indiana. The
Jungle Cats left their mark at the
IC4A get-together last year when
they fell short of copping the meet
and had to be satisﬁed with a two-
way deadlock for the second berth.

They were compensated, how-
ever, as ﬂashy “Hap” Stickle gar-
nered the 60 yard low timbers and
Dusty Rhoades came away with
part of the laurels_ in the pole
vault as there was a ﬁve-way tie.

At South Bend the Blue and
Gold spikers grabbed off the sec-
ondp toga with a total of 43 tal-
lies, the highest score that they
have marked up in this meet in
all the years of competition. Notre
Dame gave them the proverbial
nose _and won the fracas with 49
markers.

Coach Olson will have to ﬁll in

many posts that were vacated by
graduation for this season’s edi-
tion of the Blue and ‘Gold indoor
track team. The ‘hardest hit by this
purge was the mile relay aggrega-
tion, which is one of the most im-
portant cogs in indoor competition.
With the ﬂash that Peretic, Winch,
Smith and Stickleihave been sport-
ing in pre-season “get in shape”
drills might be a hint to 0lson’s
solution to the problem.

Pi Lams ln

By MIKE HERMAN
Intramural competition got off

to a ﬂying start this week as the
fraternity entries swung into bowl-
ing, basketball, and table tennis.
The results in the bowling league
games were most surprising, since
the teams that ran one-two last
year were beaten.

Pi Lambda Phi, last year’s
champs, won their first game, then
dropped the next two to the Sigma
Chi’s. Lenny Wolk’s high score
pulled the Pi Lams through their
first game, but Last_..Jordan,»and
Schultz came through for the win-
ners in the two ﬁnal matches. Burt
“Angel” Engelsberg, Pilam ace,
fell down in this contest, and failed
to show any of the form that made
him the league’s no. one bowler
last year.

The runner-up PiKA team took
a decisive 3-0 beating from aehot
Theta Chi team. The PiKA’s could
do nothing against the Theta Chi
quintet of Wetzel, Vetter, Wilson,
Fitchko, and Mundy. The last two
rolled especially good ball, and
came through to win the day's
honors. George Wedd was high
man for the PiKA's.

Bill Smith led the SAE’s to a
3-0 victory over the Delts, who

  Sgt..McDonaId Brought Fame, Victories

To   Once- Unheralded Pitt Riﬂe Squad  

By PAUL PALANZO,

Besides contributing Sergeant
York to the U. S. Army in World
War‘ I, Tennessee has also given
the University of Pittsburgh its
Sergeant McDonald, likeable and
versatile coach of the Blue and
Gold riﬂe team. “

Since 1925——almost sixteen years
now~—Se1-geant James W. McDon-
ald has been affiliated with the U.S.
Army. Interested in feeling the

J experience of army life, he left/ his

home in Tennessee to enlist in Ha‘-
waii.

After four years on the Hawai-
ian island, he retired for ten
months, only to re-enlist in 1929
at Fort Benning, Georgia. It was
here he was promoted to sergeant
and assisted in the instruction of
machine gunnery.

At the expiration "of his service
at Ft. Benning he re-enlisted for

if the second time (1934) and was

transferred to Panama and then to
the coast artillery at Ft. Monroe,
Virginia (1935). ‘
Finally, on May 9, 1938, Sgt.
McDonald was assigned to the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh in the mili-‘ ‘

tary department ROTC unit, where
he is still stationed.

Here at Pitt he succeeded Ser-
geant Gunter a's coach of the rifle
team.- This year’s team is the third
under his direction, and all of them
have been better - than - average

, ones. " _
“Hold ’em and squeeze ’em,” is
the familiar motto he repeats time

and again to his youthful riﬂe as-y

pirants. As you probably would

not expect, the Sergeant is not al-
ways serious as most military of-
ficers are. He laughs and jokes
with his boys, and they really like
him a great deal. It makes no dif-
ference whether they call him
coach, sergeant, or even Mac. A

He starts the boys shooting their
.22’s in a prone position, which is
the easiest; then the sitting, kneel-
ing, and standing positions follow
in that order.

“It usually takes three years of
constant practice to develop these
boys,“ and by the end of their
fourth years when they really be-
come dependable shooters, we
lose them,” the sergeant remarked.

What are the ideal qualiﬁcations
which make a good riﬂer? “Com-
petitiveness, perfect coordination
of the muscle and nerves, physical

ﬁtness. . . . The boy must be cool
and collected. But most of all, he
must have the guts to stick it out,”
he answered‘.

“One percent of all the would-be
riﬂemen become experts,” he added.

McDonald is certainly qualiﬁed
for the coaching position he now
holds. He can handle with excep-
tional skill the riile, pistol, machine
gun, automatic riﬂe, and the bayo-
net. He was awarded numerous
marksmanship medals while in ac-
tive service.

He is quite familiar to the ROTC
students at the university. Taking
care of the uniforms, doing cleri-
cal work,‘ and instructing classes,
at times, are only a few of his
many tasks. -

His hobby? Well, ﬁrearms, of

course.

Mrs. Starrett

Describes

Pitt Life During Last War

33/ BEA LEFKOWITZ

Pitt in 1917, at the declaration of
the rﬁrst World war, was described
today by Mrs. Agnes L. Starretl,

_-lg assistant professor of English.

, Mrs. Starret, author of the his-
tory of the University,, “Through

One Hundred and Fifty Years,"

and editor of Pitt, was a student in
3917.

Soon after the declaration oi’
War in 1917, l\/lrs. Starrett said.
Chancellor Samuel. Black McCor-

o mick spoke to the entire student

body at a mass meeting at the

_ Soldiers’ and Sailors’ memorial.

Every member of the faculty and

. every student signed a pledge oi.‘
' allegiance.

The School of lMedicine had base

»l hospital number 27. Liberty bonds

were sold on the steps of State
hall. ‘

The women of the university,‘

by their own suggestion, spent four
‘or five hours a week in training.

They spent one hour for drill, one

hour for first aid, one hour for

surgical dressings, and one or two
hours for other work, knitting,
scrapbook work, etc.

‘Chancellor McCormick wrote
personally to every man from the
University that was in the army.
Bulletins came at intervals on Pitt
Students in the national service.

»what department they were in, and
the location of their camp.

inouncement atthat time, the cam-
us was organized on a War basis.

100,000 men eating at a mess hall.
Mrs. Starrett said that even back
in 1915, the student body peti-
tioned President Wilson that they
would like to do something about
the food supply. From this action
formulated the “Pittsburgh Plan,”
a plan of war gardens cultivated
by the students themselves. These
were on the spot where the Ca-
thedral and its immediate campus
is now built.

The ROTC was established on
campus in 1918, and that same
year the fraternities gave up their
houses for barracks.

Mrs. Starrett believes that the
idea of peace was held onto longer
in 1917. In fact, she remembers
that a week before the war a meet-
ing for peace was held for students
of the three Pittsburgh colleges.

Students to Test
Driving Ability

University students who consid-

er themselves perfect “when it

comes to driving an automobile”

will get an opportunity to prove
their abilities on a reactometer be-‘
ing set up in the ground ﬂoor lobby
next Tuesday.

The reactometer, a. scientiﬁc in-
strument developed to test a driv-
er’s reactions to unforeseen con-
ditions such as stop signs, street
lights, and pedestrians, has been
loaned to the University by the
Pittsburgh Better Traffic commit-
tee.

PIayer’s Version of ‘Flight to the West’ 
Has Little Punch, Says Pitt News Critic ‘

By WILMA DOBIE

Pitt Players lifted the curtain
Wednesday night on the “propa-
ganda. play of the decade,” Elmer

Rice’s “Flight to the West.”
Lucklessly, Mr. Rice’s propagan-

da, aimed to rouse Americans to
the realities of war, lost its punch
in the bombs and blackouts that

are ours today.

Producing an Elmer Rice dranw.
is no cinch for amateur players.
Famous for his heavy and lengthy
dialogues, Rice depends on the skill
of his actors to carry the play,
rather than action. “Flight to the
West” is one of his best illustra-
tions of this. V

As the young American couple
greatly moved by the’ izcenes of
war-struck Europe, Betty Luck
and Larry Morris frequently felt
weight of,Mr. Rice’s ponderous po-
litical
confused outlook on the state of
the world.

No more so, though, than Hiram
Milton, cast as the American writ-
er; or Alma Spann as the Belgian
refugee; or Beatrice U Sheffler, a
German refugee. 0

philosophy and generally

Accents also handed the Pitt
Players a high hurdle. Alex Endy,
as the German diplomat, and Irving
Avener, a Russian professor, as
well as others in the cast portray-
ing European refugees, were more
than a little tired twisting their

tongues to the proper accent re-
quired by their roles during the

three acts.

For ﬁne scenes the audience laud-
ed the smooth performances turn-
ed in by Alma Spann, as Marie
Dickensen, the Belgian refugee;
Beatrice Sheﬁ"ler, as Frau Rosen-
thal, the German refugee; and
Hiram Milton, who turned in a
commendable performance through-
out.

Well liked, also, was Jeanine
Stephenson who portrayed the
stereotyped, Hilda Johnson, “Front
Page” woman reporter. Only in
“Flight to the West” Hilda is

Rice's play no cinch

Fitzpatrick, cast as the American
oil miner who would do business
with Hitler, and Larry Morris, as
Robert Nathan, caught several
laughs with a few out—dated re-
marks made by Mr. Rice, such as:
i“We’re not at war—-and, probably
never will be.”
Stage settings and sound effects
were well done. Particularly ef-
