-“The recent school election was

is-the answer J. C. Charlesworth,
instructor in political‘ science, and

aided student council in carrying
out annual elections for several

Five New Teams  ‘Twenty-
F our. Game Schedule
< Released Today

 

Pitt’s 1930 basketball schedule,
including 24 games ‘With outstand-
ing cage teams of the east and
middle west, was announced this
morning by‘ Don Saunders, Pitt ath-
letic publicity director. Five ‘new

son’s Phantom Panthers will‘ face
next season. =

since the Panther’s entrance to na-

tional basketball circles. The sched— I
ule playedthis spring‘ included '21 '

games, two of whichwere arranged
in mid-season. The 1928 card also

which were won by Pitt.

In arranging the schedule for
next year, Saunders success'fu1ly_
contracted with ﬁve new teams and
completed arrangementsfor a two-
game series with Notre Dame. Mus-
kingum College, the first team.ap-
pearing on the new card, contracted’

stadium. Wishing‘ to demonstrate.
several «rule changes. which. were
recommended _to basketball coaches
of the United States, Dr. Carlson
has made arrangements whereby
Muskingum and Pitt, are to meet on
December 7 in, a game exhibiting
the proposed changes.
Nebraska Comes Here

. Following the home game with
Muskingum,, the Panthers take the
road on their annual early-season
invasion of the middle west. Indiana
and Northwestern willzbe met on
week-end nights and the Iowa game-
will .follow, Monday. The Indiana
contract expires next year, - but a
renewal is probable._..A.fter the west-
ern tour the Panthers will meet
eight teams on the home‘ floor be-
fore again‘taking the road. Grove
City‘ and Ohio State complete the
December‘ home program and
Nebraska will inaugurate the new
year with a. game at the stadium

anuary 4. This -marks Nebraska’s
first appearance on the Panther
schedule and the contract calls for
another game to be played between
the two teams at ‘Lincoln the year

Montana State, another "newcomer
on the Pitt list,‘ bolsters the January
program with a game two days

Em roux POINT  
 SCORE FAULTY 

Revision Of. Tallying‘ System
Advocated By General
Public

After last Saturday’s affair at the

' stadium there has been alot of agi-..
, tation for‘ a new scoring system to

be used at Big Four track meets.
For the past two years Panther ath-
letes have won the majority of first
places and yet have ended up on the
low end of the score. In fact in the

last two years‘ the’ Pitt team has.

scored 23 out of ,8. possible 30 first
places._ Last year they won 10
events and this yearthey nailed 13.

. West‘Virg_inia,» however, by taking.

the majority of seconds have won
themeet. , ‘

‘The big fault lies in the fact that
there is not enough. emphasis laid
on the winning of ﬁrst places. There
isno doubt that West Virginia had
the best team under the existing
method of scoring, but there is quite

a bit of doubt as to whether this ‘

system is the best _that could be
used. .2. ' i -- -

The argument that the team that
has the best balanced team is the

best one should hardly hold good‘

when they are only able _to score

three ﬁrst places. This ‘might "hold

true. and probablyygdoes in_ a meet

where there is adecent number. of
teams entered, but to give ﬁve}

places when there are Qhly four
teams. is somewhat foolhardy. Even
four ‘teams are evenly

ﬁve places. There is no proﬁt in
winning if taking second will count
but one point less tlmn ﬁrst. Even
if countingﬁve ﬁrst place is cor-

.rect under ordinary conditions it
should not go here. ‘

The Big Fourmeet is no ‘ordinary
meet. What ‘it has practically

amounted to during the three years‘
of its existence is a dual’ meet with

West Virginia and Pitt‘ as the cen-

ter‘ of activities and two teams.
‘whose’ track teams,'couldn't lick ‘a
fast high-‘school team coming‘ in for

points, when~one of the other-teams
hasn’t enough entries; -

four places, and would give ﬁve
points for ﬁrst, three for second,
two for third and one for fourth. Ii’
the time should come when Tech

and Wash-Jeff build up tr.ack’tea1ns,,

then if necessary the pointxscoi-ing
system could be changed back to its
present status. . — . x
g W. Va. Wins Again
The lasthome tracknieet of the
season is an affair of ‘the’ -past, three.
of Pitt’s Big Six‘ (it used to‘ be the
Big Five‘ until Harry Robb got
tough)‘_.have made their last home

’appea~rar1ce, and West«Virginia is

again the Big Four champion. De-r
spite ,‘ the strenuous efforts of the
small: Panther track 'tea_1‘n [the M01113-
taineers had more men and bunched
their "-places to win the meet. ‘After
it is a 1 over, it is seen to be nothing‘

more ftlian a dual meet.vAs Carnegie

Tech 3‘ and '-Waslr-‘J'eff'="'were~ worse

In 1932 '

 

After meeting Army in swimming
and basketball for the‘ pastV'seve'ral
seasons and on the trackﬁthis year,
Pitt has ﬁnally convinced Army“ ath-
letic heads that Pitt produces‘ foot-
ball teams of ‘ calibre deserving :-
place on the West ‘Point- schedule.

Culminating several weeks of

negotiations between Athletic Direc-
tor Harrison and, Major. Phillip B.‘-

Fleming, graduate manager of cath-
letics at West Point, a; two-year
contract_ ‘was signed. by the two
schools at a conference «between the
athletic’ heads_ at New York last
week. Pitt will play the Army in the
Pitt stadium in November, 1931, and
a return game will be played at‘
New York or. West Point in.1932.

a steady and? consistent game, and
he easily disposed of Lindsay of

Wash-Jeff, 6-2,‘ 6-4. Cohen, Levin,
