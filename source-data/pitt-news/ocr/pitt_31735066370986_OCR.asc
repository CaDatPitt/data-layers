Farrakhan

Group discusses  
speech controversy

By Michael Ashford
Assistant News Editor

Is the Minister Louis Farrakhan a
legitimate black leader or is he a crea-
tion ofthe media? Is he anti—Jewish or
anti-Israeli and what does this mean?
What does U.S. foreign policy have to
do with the condition of blacks in this
country? What lies behind Farrakhan’s
prescriptions for black economic
development?

These are only some of the questions
raised last Friday in a forum of discus-
sion on the Minister Louis Farrakhan
and his speech last Thursday night.

Eight speakers opened what became
at times a heated debate, five of them
Pitt faculty members, as well as two
students, Rashid Soundiata of BAS and
Avery Abrams of SGB and Rev. Bob
White of the University Chaplain’s
Association.

“I thought the speech was successful
and I thought it was effective,” said
Dr. Ted Windt, associate professor of
political communications, emphasizing
Farrakahn’s message of black
economic self-reliance as fundamental
to the speech Thursday night.

“I found the talk very disappointing
and very weak,” said Dr. Larry
Glasco, professor of black and ethnic
history. “My impression was that Far-
rakhan, rather than being destroyed by
the media, is a media creation.” Glasco
argued that Farrakhan has received lit-
tle media attention in the past and only
because of his association with Jesse
Jackson and his controversial
statements gained national attention. “I
don’t see him coming out of the black
community with the power base, with
the churches, something like the days
of Malcolm X.” _

Dr. Lloyd Bond, professor of
psychology, said he felt that Farrakhan
has shown “it is possible to be critical
of the actions of the state of Israel and
not be anti-Semitic” and “to be critical
of black political leaders and not be a
bigot.” Bond added that he thought it
was a “tragedy” that two “abused and
despised” minorities, Jews and blacks,
have been pitted against each other as
a result of Farrakhan’s speech, saying
that “I have a sinking feeling in my
stomach that there is a larger power
structure that could be happy.”

Reagan prepares
for Geneva summit

(UPI) —— President Reagan spent a
quiet day in Switzerland yesterday in
preparation for his talks with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

In his broadcast speech to the nation
last Thursday, Reagan called his trip
to Geneva “a mission for peace. ” He
said his aim is to narrow the differences
between Washington and Moscow and
to build new ties between the Soviet
and American people with expanded
cultural, academic and sports activities
that will lessen the suspicions that spur
the arms race.

President Reagan said it’s “not an
impossible dream” that his summit
with Gorbachev can begin the process
of wiping out nuclear weapons. He
said, however, that his real hope is “to
open a dialogue for peace.”

He said the history of strained rela-
tions between the superpowers “does
not augur well for euphoria.” Reagan
did declare, “this meeting can be an
historic opportunity to set a steady,
more constructive course to the 21st
century.”

Some American arms control experts
are also optimistic about the chances
for a U.S.-Soviet arms accord in
Geneva. At a news conference yester-
day, three experts based their opinion
on the belief that both superpowers are
well—positioned to accept arms limits.
Retired Navy Vice Admiral John Lee
said, “All indications are that now is
the time.” But the experts agree the
disagreement over President Reagan’s
“Star Wars” anti-missile program
threatens to block any weapons pact.

With arms control at the top of the

. _ Soviet agenda for the summit, Reagan

phasize the issues he sees as equally im-
portant — particularly the Soviet role
in regional conﬂict around the world
and abuses of human rights.
Yesterday, the Soviets made an ef-
fort to improve their human rights
stand. The Soviets announced that they
are giving exit visas to 10 Russians
with American spouses. The 10 peo-
ple are expressing great joy at the

‘Soviet’s latest attempt at a public rela-

tions coup. Tony Bartholomew of
Glendale, Ca1if., said the announce-
ment came as he was about to give up
hope of ever seeing his Soviet bride
again.

The President tried to keep minimum
expectations of concrete arms control
progress. At the same time, he
stressedthe importance of finding
“common ground” that will lead to
cuts in nuclear arsenals. “While it
would be naive to think a single sum-
mit can establish a permanent peace,
this conference can begin a dialogue for
peace,”Reagan said.

Reagan repeated his pledge of last
week that the United States is willing
“to reduce comparable nuclear systems
by 50 percent.” He continued, “We
seek reductions that would result in
stable balance between us, with no first
strike capability and verified com-
pliance.”

There have been suggestions that
Reagan and Gorbachev might agree on
a framework for U.S. and Soviet
negotiators to follow in arms talks.
Secretary of State Schultz, however,
told reporters last Thursday that such
an accord is “possible but not pro-

Chlamydiacases increasing rapidly  
By Michelle Zollner

Sexually transmitted diseases are on
the rise due to the changes in sexual
behavior; the most frequently transmit-
ted is chlamydia, according to Dr. A.
Amortegui, an associate professor of
pathology at the University of Pitts-
burgh and a pathologist at Magee
Womens Hospital. Amortegui’s area of
expertise is chlamydia.

“The increased sexual behavior.
caused by uninformed young people
whose parents are unwilling to educate
them and the mass media which
overemphasizes sex in society, is the
reason the disease is affecting such a
young age group,”Amortegui said.

In the 1960s, chlamydia effected
mostly 20- to 30-year-olds. Today,
however, chlamydia affects the 15- to
24- year-old range. “This increase in
the younger age group could have
serious consequences to the in-
dividual,” said Amortegui.

“Chlamydia affects male and female
adults and children,” he continued.
Both males and females can be carriers
of the disease. The principal source of
transmission is through sexual inter-
course. However, there is another less
common way for chlamydia to enter the
body. When an individual has
chlamydia in the form of an eye infec-

    

~,w,eek’peri‘od‘; After the h1edicatio'n'has

of the infected ﬂuids into another per-
sons eye. The disease also can be
transferred to a baby during the birth

process. However, a female does not _

automatically transmit chlamydia to the
baby.

. According to Amortegui, 75 percent
of all college students are sexually ac-

tive. And according to Dr. Pamela

Bowen of the Student Health Services
on campus, Pitt students are not im-

mune to chlamydia. “Certainly we '

have diagnosed chlamydia here on
campus,” she said. Bowen said Student
Health Services does not have statistics
regarding the number of Pitt students
with chlamydia.

Student Health Services does
believe, though, that chlamydia is a
serious enough disease, so they are cur-
rently doing a study on 75 people in
cooperation with the‘Allegheny Coun-
ty Health Department.

Symptoms of chlamydia normally
appear 10 to 20 days after sexual con-
tact with a person having the disease.
A female would have mild abdominal
pains or spotting. The male may ex-
perience painful urination, itching or
burning in the groin area. Amortegui
said people should be aware of their
sexual partners because chlamydia can
occur with no symptoms accompany-
ing it. '

Chlamydia is a curable disease,
though. The treatment is done with a
broad spectrum of antibiotics for a two-

    

been taken for two weeks, a test is done
to determine if the individual has been
cured of chlamydia.

If left untreated, chlamydia can
disappear by itself. This occurs when

the individual’s body stimulates its own -

natural antibodies to fight against the
disease. If complications should arise
however, women can become infertile
or have the risk of transferring the

chlamydia to their newborn babies; Ac- _

cording to the Allegheny County
Health Department, males have the risk

of a scarred and partially or totally _

blocked urethra. In some men, it may
spread deeply and cause a condition
called chronic prostatitis which may
last for years.

“The risk of contracting chlamydia
increases tremendously with people
who have multiple partners,” said
Amortegui. The best means of protec-
tion is abstaining from sexual activity.
However, Amortegui_offered other
sage forms of protection. He suggested
females use an intravaginal contracep-
tive while men use the condom.
Amortegui stressed “the birth control
must be used from the beginning to the
end.”

If persons know that they’ have .

chlamydia, they should become
quarantined from sexual activity until
after they have had successful treatment
curing them of the chlamydia. Plain
honesty, said Amortegui, would also

help in’ preventing.chlamydia’s con— ’
'tinuous increase ‘- r  « ~~ ‘

Columbian volcano eruption called deadliest of the century

COLOMBIA — Last week's surpise
volcanic eruption in the coffee-growing
region of western Colombia is now be-
ing called the deadliest to have occur-
red in the Western Hemisphere this
century.

The snow-capped volcano Nevado
Del Ruiz had been inactive for nearly

_four. centuries. but when it erupted last
;‘ Wednesday night, it did so with
vengeance. Government officials said
residents living under the volcano
3 refused to leave despite a warning last
 week of a 67 percent chance of an erup-
. tion which could cause mudslides.
The Colombian government gave in
“ yesterday to public pressure and will
I continue to search for survivors. The
T health minister announced yesterday
.4 afternoon the end of the search, declar-
' ing his belief that all the survivors from
the mud-covered town of Armero had
been found, but a few hours later the
decision had been reversed. One doc-
tor estimates there are still 100 people
alive in the mud, which is the tomb for
an estimated 25,000 victims. Six of
those survivors were found earlier
yesterday.

The Reagan administration sent 12
helicopters, relief experts and $25,000

v in aid to the relief effort.

Pope John Paul said yesterday that
._ he is united with “heart and prayer”
' to the victims of the volcano eruption

last week. In a message on Vatican
radio, the Pontiff offered his con-
dolences to families who lost loved
ones.

President Belisario Betancur of Col-
ombia appealed for calmness.
Thousands of survivors ﬂed Saturday
when there were reports of minor erup-
tions. American, Swiss and French
scientists and the Colombian govern-
ment question whether there were more
explosions. Some experts said lightning

or other atmospheric disturbances have"

been mistaken for volcanic activity.
activity. ,

In Bogota yesterday, the health
minister said the area around the city
of Armero will be designated as
“holy ground.”

Balancing job and 
family is stressful

BOSTON — Balancing the respon-
sibilities of a job with the respon-
sibilities of a family is a lot of work
and it’s stressful, too.

In fact, researchers at Boston
University said that stress is the No.
1 factor leading to depression for peo-
ple who work — both men and women.

They also said their research refutes
the belief that women are more prone

to depression than men. That is, if men
spent as many total hours on their com-

bined work and chores, they would be .

just as prone to depression as women.

Dianne Burden and Bradley Googin
studied the effects family life had on
651 employees at a large Boston-based
company. Burden said they knew farrii—
ly life was changing and they wanted
to see how that affected the workplace.

Both male and female employees
said scheduling difficulties were the
major way their home and corporate
lives interfered.

The study showed the combination
of work and family responsibilities puts
more stress on women than on men.
Working mothers spent up to 85 hours
a week in both capacities, while work-
ing fathers spent66 combined hours.

According to Burden, “while
women had higher levels of depression
and stress, it was not because of
gender. but because of the amount of
hours spent on home chores.”

Reagan seeks
school aid change

WASHINGTON — The Reagan ad-
ministration is urging a major change
in school aid for underprivileged
children. It’s a federal voucher pro-
gram, similar to the food stamp pro-
gram which would let parents buy

education services at schools of their
choice, public or private.

The proposal would be revenue
neutral, funded with about $3 billion
that already is spent on such aid.

Some critics say the plan is a bid to
provide government aid to church-
related schools. Others warn it could
undercut public school systems.

Education secretary William Bennett
explained the concept by saying, “At
present, our more afﬂuent families do
exercise choice by buying a home" in
a neighborhood of their choice, or by
sending their children to private school.
The poor do not have that kind of
choice, yet it is their children for whom
education may represent the best op-
pprtunity for success in later life.”

Bennett said the measure would have
to be approved by Congress, and would
encourage competition. ‘among all
schools.

The voucher system would replace
the current Chapter One Program,
which gives federal money to public
schools to provide special educational
services for disadvantaged students.

While some religious leaders applaud
the idea, the National Education
Association, the country’s largest
teachers’ union, opposes the voucher
plan. The NEA said it would “gut” the
Chapter One Program without improv-
ing the quality of education.

Forum predicts
e_conornic growtr 

NEW YORK -— The year is almost
over and predictions for the coming 12
months are starting to come in.

One is from the economic forum of
the conference board. The panel,
made up of 13 of the country’s most
prominent economic analysts, meets
twice a year to look into its own crystal
ball.

The latest view is one of steady
economic growth for the United States
in 1986. Inﬂation will be moderate, and
unemployment could be slightly lower.

The median forecast calls for inﬂa-
tion of 4.2 percent, up slightly from
this years _3.6 percent. Unemployment
could drop back from seven percent to
six percent. _

As for real gross national product,
the expectation is of a 3.2 percent

growth rate compa_red to the 1985
estimate of 2.1 percent.

On the purely financial side of the
ledger. prime rates should average 9.5
percent. about the same as last year.
Corporate profits should increase by
seven percent. reversing the year’s
decline of 2.1 percent.

Signals sought .
in plant closings

PHILADELPHIA — Two Temple
University researchers said companies
that are planning to close or relocate

I should give early signals that workers
and local governments. can look for.

The researchers, Professors Raj
Chaganti and Robert Hamilton of Tem-
ple’s School of Business Administra-
tion. said if governments payattention
to those signals, they might be able to
help avert plant closings.

Governments and workers should
look for changes in corporate owner-
ship or control, ﬁnancial performance
and the corporate structure. All these
things could signal a possible desire or
need to move. »

Small companies are more likely to
stay put than large ones because the
professors said they are usually family-
owned. A decision to move would
mean the owner would have to leave
his roots and that is something most
small businessmen are reluctant to do.

Chaganti and Hamilton based their
conclusions on a recent study of 25
companies in Pennsylvania, . New
Jersey and Delaware that have been
closed or relocated. A

Farrakhan’ s
Appeal

in spite of the bad-niou
the Rev. Louis Farrakhan continues to attract large
audiences wherever he speaks, and his inﬂuence
among the black community is clearly on the rise.
This trend is not without good reason.

Let us forget, for the moment, the allegations of C

racism and bigotry made against Farrakhan. Here
is a man — articulate and skilled in speech—mak1ng
—— of strong will and personality, who ‘is able to gi_ve
voice to the growing sense of dissatisfaction with
the social contract occuring within the black com-
munity. Here is a man willing to challenge the ex-
isting social order, to strive for social reform‘: and
to seek the redress of the grievances held by the
black community. ‘ _
Farrakhan’s appeal as a black leader 1S symp-

. tomatic of the injustices and indignities that the

black community as a whole is forced to suffer in
American society. The civil rights movement has
made little progress since the 1960s, and the status
of blacks, economically as well as socially, has
shown little improvement in the last decade and a
half. In short, in spite of the reforms of the 1960s,

blacks in our country are yet treated, at best, as

second-class citizens.

The black community is justifiably angry. The
Rev. Farrakhan offers strong, forceful leadership
against the oppressive forces that conspire against
blacks in our society and keep them in subjugation
and squalor. And, whether white society likes it or
not, Farrakhan will not go away.

Is Louis Farrakhan a racist? This question we
leave unanswered, but instead offer this advice:
Racist sentiments among blacks can be eliminated
through equality of opportunity and the elevation
of their social and economic status to one com-
parable to that of whites. The racist policies of white
society are very much to blame for blacks’ resent-
ment and even hatred of whites. Therefore, social
reform isthe way to end hostility and silence con-

flict. Also, from a moral standpoint, reform might _

ensure that justice is served.

Royal Couple

Your editorial of Wed. Nov. 13, en-
titled “Royal Couple,” was startling
for its vehemence and invective tone.
It is clear that the role of the royal fami-
ly in the social, economic and political
life of Great Britain has never been ex-
plained to you.

It is not a paradox that the existence
of the royal family in a “supposedly
classless, democratic society,” con-
tinues because, for one thing, the class
boundaries in Great Britain _are more
stringent than in any other country I
have seen (save France). Obviously,
the royal family is seen as representing
the apex of the class system — one can
go no higher. The queen is the head of
the state,.too; this is her official title
and will pass on to Charles when he
succeeds. It’s in the British constitu-
tion. The queen’s political role is com-
plex and multi-faceted. She opens
parliament each year, for instance. The
prime minister, if on the way out, tends
his or her resignation to the monarch.

The head of state in [England is a
(now) symbolic role; the queen can be
viewed as a figurehead, much like Mr.

Reagan. But this was not always so.

Queen Elizabeth traces her ancestry
back to King Egbert, who became King
of England in 829 A.D., roughly three
hundred years before the first parlia-
ment. And you are going to turn this

much tradition on its head in one -

editorial? I think not.

The queen does a good job as head
of state and commonwealth, according
to 93 percent of the British in a 1983
poll. _

Socially, all the members of the royal
family are very active. Their charity
work is enormous. Though they are not
supposed to get involved in political
issues anymore — because of the
tremendous power they have through
the people’s devotion, and the possi-
ble sway this might cause at elections
— Charles actually broke with this
precedent when he took a stance on the
recent riots that have begun since That-
cher achieved premiership. This will
get the ball rolling fast and will certain-
ly be -a topic at the 1987 elections.

The royal family is very good for
Britain‘s waning economy. London had
24 million tourists last year, many of
them American. Why do they come?
To see something that has not
developed in this country: tradition,
which in England is based mainly on
our royalty. Thesetourists drop dollars
freely, dollars we badly need in Brit-
ain. The tourist industry is big there,
creating 60,000 new jobs last year.
This is certainly a productive reﬂection
on the royal family.

So you see? If anything, the role of
the royal family is getting greater as
time goes on. Go over to England and
see for yourself. There’s lots to see, the

After reading Suso Platero’s letter in
The Pitt News on Wednesday, I was
terribly offended. Perhaps Platero
would have me feeling guilty, ashamed
and deserved of an unwanted pregnan-
cy because I'do not plan to lead the life
of abstinence until my wedding day.
Platero said, “Premarital pregnancy is
an unfortunate yet essentially avoidable
situation because sex is avoidable —
not easy to resist but possible for one
who makes a mature decision in the
light of his values.”

Who are you to judge what is the
mature decision and what are the right
values? I do not think it is immature
to make love to someone I love. Ex-
pressing your vulnerability and the
need you have for another human be-
ing is far from being immature. Mar-
riage cannot make thislove be more
mature or grow in any way, only the
people in love can. A simple piece of
paper is not going to change the way
two people feel about each other. In my
heart and mind the experiences that I
have had with the men I loved could
never be reduced to the “good times”
that you equate with premarital sex.

As for your views on abortion, do
you really think an unwanted pregnan-
cy automatically becomes wanted
because a woman is married? Do you
really think only unmarried women

seek abortions? What if the woman’s -

life is in danger? Should she let herself
die, leaving the child with no one. if
the child survives? What if the child has

‘been exposed to toxic substances or

disease that would cause severe men-
tal retardation or extreme deformation?
Could you watch your child suffer
through the few years that it may sur-
vive knowing it would never be able
to lead a normal life? Most people can-
not handle this situation and resort to
placing their children in institutions. Or
would you terminate its life before it
began to suffer? Tell me, which is more
cruel?

Admittedly most abortions are per-
fonned because the child is not wanted;
the reason is not because contraception
is ineffective but because it was
unavailable or because the woman or
girl did not know it was available, how
to use it or where to get it. If our so-
ciety would realize that lack of
knowledge is the problem, not the solu-
tion, abortions would only be needed
in medical em_ergencies.

Abstinence is not the only preventive
measure you can take; contraception is
not as risky as you think if used prop-

erly. According to Mademoiselle of
Oct. ’85, the pill is 97-100 percent ef-
fective, the IUD 98 percent, the
diaphragm 97 percent, contraceptive
foams and jellies 80-85 percent, con-
doms up to 90 percent, contraceptive
sponges 89-91 percent, and even the
rhythm method has a 60-80 percent
chance of preventing pregnancy.
Also, if parents would just take the
time to communicate with their kids
and explain sex to them — how to be
careful, how you make a baby, how
you don’t make a baby — talking would
eliminate most of the problem of
teenage pregnancy. If the parents are
unable to handle this responsibility it
should be turned over to the schools.

. It is a paradox that the people who op-

pose abortion are the same ones who
oppose the means to eliminate the need
for abortion.

I agree that men must also face their
responsibility. The men I know are
conscientious about using birth control.
They do not believe in taking un-

necessary risks with their lives or their .

partners’. Men are not the only_ones
who “listen to their enzymes;” sex
takes two consenting adults. You can-
not blame men for_unwanted pregnan-
cies. They are not twisting your arm,

and you can always say “no.”

From A Distant Shore/ Trent Curtis and Chris Biancheria

Homosexuality: Biological PerspectiveAnd Its Ramifications

Sigmund Freud once reminded his
associates to "bear in mind that some
day all our provisional formulations in
psychology will have to be based on an
organic foundation. 

One would have done well to heed
this notion, as today a general shift is
being observed from a psychoanalytical
to a biological perspective with regards
to the origins of homosexuality. If
evidence of this becomes concrete.
what would be the ramifications for
society? ’

Tests are being and have been

 developed for the prenatal detection of
' birth defects, such as Down’s Syn-

drome. If a speciﬁc biological basis for
homosexuality is found, is it not also
feasible that procedures could be
developed to test for and change the
sexual orientation of the baby? This
could then be used as a method to
eradicate homosexuality.

At first thought this use of medical

manipulation and determinism may
seem a bit far-fetched. but is it really‘?
How different would this be from the
endeavors of the Nazis to create an
Arian race? Like the Nazis. who had
specific standards for the desirable
human being, so too, it seems, does
America — the statistically proven
most homophobic Western nation —
have standards for the desirable sexual
orientation.

Consider how American homosex-
uals are treated. Homophobia is ram-
pant throughout almost every major in-
stitution in America. Most religious
foundations consider homosexuality not
only unnatural, but a mortal sin. They
are also shunned from the priesthood.
convents and other ruling bodies of the
church. The government has made and
enforced laws which supress homosex-
uals. For instance, they are expressly

. forbidden to serve in the military. If,

one is discovered, then he or she is not
only discharged, but dishonorably so.

In terms of education. homosexual
teachers are constantly under fire. If
one seeks psychological aid. he or she
may be hard—pressed to ﬁnd a sym-
pathetic car. as homosexuality was only
recently removed from the “Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders." On another level.
homosexuals are often victims of
homophobic "fag bashers."

For the use of biological "treat-
ment" for homosexuality to be put in-
to effect, it [homosexuality] would ﬁrst
have to be seen as a defect, an abnor-
mality. But yet. it occurs in about l0-20
percent of population, if one does" not
include bisexuals. How can something
which occurs so regularly be con-
sidered abnormal? Are other biological
occurrences, such as red hair and left-
handedness, considered abnormal?
What need is there for a “cure” for a
condition which has not been proven
harmful? Consider how the alteration
of someone's sexual orientation could

affect his or her future. If famous
homosexuals of the past. such as Walt
Whitman. Gertrude Stein and William
Shakespeare had been altered to be
heterosexual. maybe they wouldn‘t
have done the things which made them
famous. They would no longer have
been the same people.

An argument in favor of the use of
this procedure could be something like
this: Since homosexuals are oppressed.
which can cause depression. why not
save them from this by making them
heterosexuals? This is ridiculous.
Heterosexuals get depressed and can be
oppressed too. Look at how oppressed
the blacks were. especially in the ‘S05
and‘60s. and still are today. Are we to
then develop procedures to prevent
people from being black? Of course
not, because the concepts of what con-
stitutes a minority and an abnormality
are extremely relative. Homosexuality
was very normal and accepted in an-
cient Greece. I-Ieterosexuality. thus.

was not the overwhelming norm that
it is today.

On a positive side. a biological base
for homosexuality could work to

eradicate our societysstereotypes. The A

theory that it is unnatural would then
have to be reworked. because how
could something biologically innate be
considered unnatural? How one is born
is natural; tampering with someone is
unnatural.

One final point of interest would be
the role of environmental factors as an
inﬂuence on an individual with a
biologically predisposed sexual orien-
tation. If gender nonconformity and
sexual orientation are predisposed by
biological factors, society would do
well to reconsider its expectations of
masculine and feminine gender roles,
thus easing the pressureon all of us.

Editor's note: We authors of this col-
umn tlrew upon the book "Sexual
Preference "for supporting material.

Latenight Insight/ Joe Seman

The other night, after I ﬁnished work
at The Pitt News, a few of my friends
and I started talking about exactly what
the hell it is we are doing in college.
We talked about how we wanted to ex-
pand our horizons and broaden
ourselves intellectually and socially.
Then we cut through the crap and
decided that the real reason we’re here
is to get degrees that will enable us to
get good jobs that pay lots of money.
Even beyond that, we decided, we are

‘ here to get easy jobs so that we won’t

have to spend our lives digging sewer
lines or serving out our dreary ex-
istences as managers of fast-food
restaurants. ,

The funny thing about the whole con-

_ versation is that all of us had entered

the university as the elite of our respec-
tive freshman engineering classes, and

none of us are engineering students any
longer. We all realized that we were
going against our own prime reasons
for being at college — to get cushy,
high-paying jobs — and that, as it
stands, none of us would probably be
employable after we finished our
undergraduate degrees. The only peo-
ple that we could think of who were
getting jobs were engineers and high-
tech majors. Here I am, a poli-sci ma-
jor. How many political scientists do
you know that are making big bucks?
Better yet, how many liberal arts ma-
jors do you know that are even getting
interviews? We decided that we had all
either screwed up massively or that
something is desperately wrong with
the idea of education that says that a
college degree consists of no more than
a highly advanced, high-intensity trade

program. After .a little thought, we
decided that it was the latter.

We agreed to two things: First, we
feel that we are getting a better educa-
tion as liberal arts majors — that we
are learning more things about a much
broader range of topics. Second, that
the engineering school, though it was
training us in marketable job skills, was
providing an education that was in-
credibly narrow. We were forced to
look at our motivations once again. and
to our collective surprise, we found that
our ideals weren’t really so far from
those we had discounted at the start of
our discussion. We all agreed that

though we would probably have ex- _

celled in the engineering ﬁeld, the
money just wasn't enough. We all
wanted to do things with our lives that
simply could not be done as engineers.

We decided that we didn't want to
spend our college careers being groom-
ed to fit into some corporation's
research and development machine.
and we didn’t want to spend our lives
in those positions. We decided that we
wanted to be educated, not trained.

College should be much more than
a step on the ladder to monetary suc-
cess. People who look at it as such are
missing out on a huge aspect of life.
We decided that college should indeed
be a broadening experience. and that
there is much more to being educated
than being able to integrate a complex
function or draw the iron-carbon phase
diagram. «

People will probably argue that I am
being unfair to technical majors and
engineering students in particular ——
that I am not considering the fact that

  Specialization Creating Narrow, Well-Paid Technicians

the student has the opportunity to
choose classes outside of his discipline.
When I entered the School of Engineer-
mg. I had the opportunity to take a
grand total of four electives. Four elec-
tives does not an education make.

The bottom line. we decided’, was
that all of our discussion was in-
teresting. but that in the end it was ir-
relevant. The engineers and the high-
tech majors get the jobs. That is reali-
ty. However, the over-specialization of
a technical education can cheat a stu-
dent out of the chance to experience
what a true university education is —
an incredibly diverse and stimulating
experience — and no student should
waste the opportunities to increase his
educational horizons as they present
themselves at a university.

Prostitution Sadly, Its Victims Are Many

The New York Criminal Compensa-
tion Board has received a claim for
money damages. It comes from a
former neighbor of the notorious and
(given book and movie deals) sudden-

‘ ly rich Sidney Biddle Barrows, known

to headline writers the world over as
the Mayﬂower Madam. The former
neighbor claims she was forced
to move because of Barrows’ “all-night
bordello operating full-scale next

doorf’
-What a relief! For lo these many

months we have been reading about the
arrest and conviction of the well-born
and well-connected Barrows as if the
cliche about prostitution being a vic-
timless crime was entirely true. Here
at last is a woman asserting the op-
posite. It’s true that compared to many
crime victims, hers is a minor com-
plaint. But for the moment it will have
to do. After all, the real victims of
prostitution rarely complain.

Not In Kansas Anymore/ Kevin
Distinctions Anarchy Is Not Chaos,

Making

Every now and then I am periodical-
ly reminded that people use words
without knowing what they really
mean. One example of such a word is
anarchy.

You have no doubt heard the word

' used as a synonym for chaos which

means total disorder in a system,
especially a social system. (“Beirut is
in anarchy,” “South African whites
believefanarchy will prevail if they
dismantle apartheid”) However, the
two have very little in common outside
of popular usage.

Consider the various types of
government:

The real victims are the prostitutes
themselves. They are the invisible peo-
ple of any prostitution saga, the ones
who are never mentioned when pros-
titution involves rich men, glamorous-
looking women and, especially, if the
business is being conducted below
125th Street in Manhattan by white
people. A darker skin color instantly
transforms prostitution into what it
always is — a sordid affair often in-
volving violence and the exploitation
of women.

For some reason, that kind of realism
did not intrude into the Mayflower
Madam affair. Instead, call girls and
madams who do business in the right
zip codes are written about as if they
are master criminals — expert safe
crackers. cat burglers like Cary Grant
in “To Catch a Thief.” They’re
criminals only in a strictly technical
sense. They either rob from the well-
to-do or the well-insured —— supposed

'1) Monarchy. Government by one
individual who probably inherited the
job from his or her parents or another
relative.

2) Dictatorship. Very similar to
monarchy, except one’s successors are

usually determined through some other i

process.
3) Oligarchy. Rule by a small group
rather than an individual.’
4) Democracy. Rule by the consen-
sus of those who chose to vote; usual-
ly all who live in democratic countries

-have the right to vote and have a

minimum of two parties from which to
chose. (This is the system we think we

no-fault crimes in which no one gets
hurt, physically, economically or
emotionally.

That kind of prostitution requires the
willing suspension of disbelief that col-
lege English professors tell you is
necessary for certain kinds of fiction.
It works. People seem willing to
believe about prostitutes what they
would never believe about themselves
—- namely. that it is possible to be
used and abused sexually and not suf-
fer for it. They make glamorous what
is really sordid.

The so-called Mayﬂower Madam is
a perfect example of this sort of thing.
You can bet, for instance, that no book
and movie package worth an estimated
$600,000 will tell anything near the
truth about prostitution -— tell about
pimps and their violence, customers
and their weird demands. It will say
nothing about sexual degradation, ex-
ploitation and the psychological

Bold 

have.)

There are some individuals who do
not believe in any of these forms of
government. Their viewpoint is not
without some foundation, as the history
of government is the history of the
abuse of power. (Reread the descrip-
tions above, substituting the words
“government” and “rule” with

" “tyranny and they will remain true.)
Therefore, these people say, there
should be no government.

These people are known as anar-
chists, and what they advocate is anar-

chy —- not chaos, but no government}

No government, they believe, means

tasies. It will say nothing about perver-
sions and violence and how the
glamorization of high-priced prostitu-
tion ’in high—rent districts makes a
mockery of attempts to control it
everywhere.

This is not a moral argument against
prostitution, although there would be
nothing wrong with that. Maybe it
ought to be de-criminalized. Maybe
prostitution ought to be licensed as it
is in some places in Europe. But
morality aside, the fact remains that
prostitution takes a toll both on the peo-
ple involved in it and —— as the erstwhile
neighbor can testify — on the
neighborhoods where prostitutes
operate; especially the poorer ones.

In the end, of course, Barrows will
tell her story her way, probably tailor-

Nothing will be said to contradict the
beliefs of those who think that prostitu-
tion is a victimless crime —— although,
for sure, Barrows’ close relatives and
everyone else she shamed can testify
to the contrary. So can Barrows
herself. Behind that glamorous facade
is probably a lady with some awful

tion pays so well.

So a small cheer for the woman who

Have blacks in America made prog-

“We assumed that somethingpositive
had taken place — we were wrong,”
said Dr. Lloyd Bell, addressing ap-
proximately 100 people Friday after-
noon in the William Pitt Union as a part
of_Black Week.

“Black people never looked at the
cost of ending segregation,” he said.
“White people were trying to tell us

Red Cross

seeks funds
for relief

The Pittsburgh-Allegheny County
chapter of the American Red Cross has
been requested to raise ‘$200,000 as

, part of its share in a nationwide

Disaster Emergency Relief campaign
launched by the National Red Cross

- Thursday, Nov. 7.

According to George Pulianas, chair-
man of the local Red Cross chapter, an
unprecedented series of natural
disasters, climaxing with the Nov. 5
floods that devastated areas of
southwestern Pennsylvania, have
drained the Red Cross national disaster
fund.

“ The president of the American Red
Cross, Richard Schubert, reported that
relief costs thus far this year [the fiscal
year starting July 1] having exceeded
$39 million, leaving Red Cross with a
deficit of nearly $5 million,” Pulianas
said.

Schubert then announced a national
disaster relief campaign for $20 million
to meet current and future disaster
demands. Pulianas explained that Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny County’s share of
that goal is $200,000.

“It is estimated that substantially
more than this will be spent in ﬂood
relief here in southwestern Penn-
sylvania, particularly in the Mon
Valley,” Pulianas emphasized.

“Already the people of Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County have respond-
ed to the needs of ﬂood victims by con-
tributing $l24,000,” Pulianas said.
“Included in this ﬁgure is $7,500 from
Peoples Gas — the first contribution to
come in — $25,000 from the Richard
King Mellon Foundation and $20,000
from Bell of Pennsylvania.”

More than 500 individuals and
families were housed by the Pittsburgh-
Allegheny County chapter in shelters
when the ﬂoods first hit in Allegheny
County. In the heavily affected Mon.
Valley, more than 950 homes were
destroyed or damaged. Local Red
Cross volunteers and staff are on the
scene in the ﬂood areas, assessing

damage and seeing to the immediate ‘

needs of food, clothing, shelter and
medical supplies. Red Cross will con-
tinue to work with these ﬂood victims,
helping to get them on their feet again
with long-term assistance as needed.

Pulianas said the national Red Cross
ﬁgures show that 5,656,000 Americans
have been affected by disasters just
since Labor Day, and the Red Cross
has spent millions of dollars to help
them. “Here at home,” Pulianas con-
tinued, “we talk in terms of hundreds
and perhaps thousands of victims, but
their needs are the same, and Red
Cross must and will be there. That's
why we’re asking for help. Please send
monetary contributions to the
American Red Cross ﬂood relief, P.O.

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Four-star general Roscoe Robinson,_

a Pitt graduate, re-afﬁrrned the success
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO), the West’s principal

political and military coalition, and he -

suggested several ways it could be
improved.

“NATO works,” the General said.
“We haven’t had a war in Europe for
forty years.”

Robinson spoke Thursday night in an
address to the Colloquium on Security
in an Interdependent World. Robinson,
who is a graduate of the Graduate
School of Public and International Af-
fairs, has just recently completed a
three-year term as an American
representative to NATO’s military
committee.

In.his lecture, Robinson discussed

The Pitt News, November 18, 1985

the present state of NATO, saying he
believes conventional military strength
to be the allies greatest concern.
According to the general, “The
Soviets in the past few years have im-
proved their conventional capabilities
tremendously. We used to say,
‘They’ve got more but we’ve got bet-
ter.’ That is no longer the case.”
Robinson noted, however, that
NATO is and should continue to im-

prove its own non-nuclear capabilities. .

“We must continue to modernize our
equipment. We’re working hard to
close the widening gap.”

Robinson said he also believes the
United States should strive to maintain
and improve relations with its Euro-
pean counterparts in NATO. “NATO
is not a totally American alliance,” the
general remarked. “If war started
tomorrow, [initially] 90 percent of all
conventional forces would be Euro-

‘Nato works,’ says visiting general

pean. We should recognize the con-
tributions of our European allies. They
[in turn] recognize the strength of the
United States and also realize our ef-
forts to make the alliance work.”

During his tenure as a member of the
military committee, Robinson had
often dealt with the problem of ter-
rorism as it pertains to NATO. “We
have tried to get cooperation on the
issue. It has been difﬁcult [however],
for many nations view terrorism as an
internal problem.”

A subject to which the general allud-
ed throughout hisaddress was the uni-
ty of NATO. In responding to a ques-
tion pertaining to dissension in the
alliance, Robinson remarked, “All you
have to do is go to some of those for-
tieth anniversary celebrations and I
think you’ll see that anti-American and
anti—NATO sentiment isn’t as great as
the papers show it to be.”

Suicide rate low on

By Karen Pennewill
For The Pitt News

Suicide on the University of Pitts-
burgh's campus is not common. There
were no reported cases of suicide in
1983, according to the last available
campus police statistical reports.

In 1979, the campus had only one in-
cident of suicide. The ﬁgures for 1984
and 1985 are not available yet.
However, there has been a deﬁnite
decrease in the suicide rate on campus.
according to the available reports.

“On the average, we have about two
attempted suicides a year," said Walt
Waters, assistant director of ﬁeld
operations for the campus police. “One
of them is guaranteed to be around the
end of the grade period.”

"In the last six months there have
been two suicides in Oakland.” said Lt.
William Kroll. of Pittsburgh police sta-
tion No. 4 in Oakland. Inspector
William Ward of No. 4, who oversees
the station and the performance of his
men, said the average yearly suicide
rate for the Oakland area is between
four and ﬁve.

College students can have a variety
of reasons for attempting suicide.
“Primarily on the college campus, at-
tempted suicide is usually associated
with some type of perceived failure on
the person’s part," said James Watters,
assistant director of public safety.

» “Either they attempted a graduate pro-

gram and it didn’t work out or they had
some tremendous hardship in a rela-
tionship. Given a student‘s age and lack

campus and in Oakland a

of experience. they don't cope with it
all very well.“

Watters adds that. unfortunately.
some students attempt suicide as an
answer. “Grades and pressure from
parents affects students —— some more
than others, said .Waters. Also. he
believes ‘that C people who attempt
suicide are basically looking for help.

The Campus Police. when respond-
ing to an attempted suicide incident.
have two ways of handling the situa-
tion. Police may take a person to the
counseling center on campus. or to
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic.

Sometimes a student has not done
any physical harm to himself. Ifthere
is some question in the officer’s mind
as to the uncertainty of the student‘s ac-
tions. the student will be taken to the

counseling center.

"The ofﬁcer has to decide whether
the situation is really a serious suicide
attempt or just a cry for help.” says W.
Waters. People who use the attempt of
suicide to get attention are usually taken
to the counseling center.

There are psychologists on call 24
hours a day. The center is -located in
the William Pitt Union on the third
floor in room 334. Psychologists can
be reached at 624-5804.

If an ofﬁcer decides the person is
serious in his attempt to commit
suicide. he can have the person in-
voluntarily committed. A student can
be commited for up to 72 hours at
WPIC. '

The Campus Police act under the
State Mental Health Act 302. They
have the power under 302 to commit

I Page

a student for observation and
preliminary treatment if he,has taken
an overt step and presents a danger to
himself or someone else." stated W.
Waters. “The intake ofﬁcers at- the
psychiatric institute would then do what
is appropriate as far as treatment," he
continued. If arrangements for in—house'
services are needed. the intake ofﬁcers
take care of it. Students who need
medical treatment receive it and are

then transferred from the hospital to.

WPIC.

From his experience with Pitt’s cam-
pus. W. Waters said the attempted
suicide victims are more often white
males. “Males are known for shooting
themselves. jumping off bridges and

the more violent types of suicide. There -

are always exceptions though." said
W. Waters.

Farrakhan

continued from page I .
The most heated discussion turned
around the purported anti-Semitism of

I Farrakhan’s remarks. At times. the
forum broke down as people shouted

their opinions across the room.

Rev. Bob White, of the University
Chaplain’s Association, argued that
'Farrakhan’s potential anti-Semitism is
dangerous and that racism and anti-
Semitism find their roots in Christian
theology. “Louis Farrakhan is anti-

Semitic,” he said, “and we have to
, deal with that issue.” White pointed, ,
. out that “to suggest that the roots of

Judaism have somehow been

‘obliterated by revisionist historians in .

Egypt,” as he argues Farrakhan has
done, “is a revulsion and has no

business in orthodox Islamic thought. ’ ”
Dr- Bargar Ahore, professor of".

social work and activist-din the black
civil rights movement, expressed her
concern over the possible split between
blacks and Jews, “two minority
groups, each of whom has a history of
being a scapegoat in maneuvering by
political and economic leadership...
When two‘ such groups become

alienated from each other,” she add— I

ed,’ ‘ ‘and enter the scapegoating among
themselves. . .they are in danger of not
finding solutions to the problems they
face.” I
Both Shore and Bond expressed con-
cern and disappointment that questions
of anti-Semitism and the condition of
blacks in America today have ‘become
related under Farrakhan’s leadership.
“None of these questions or answers
[on the inability of blacks as a minori-
ty to establish a stronger economic
position in society] seem to have
anything to do with Jews, on their
religion or on their place in this socie-
ty. It is indeed the issue of [black]
economic plight that should be the cen-
tral issue in this regard,” she said, ad-
ding that “it is important for us to
unlink these issues.” ' ’

- ' Bond, in a similar vein, said, “I'm

not completely convinced that his
separation of his statements [on] Israel
and the anti-Sernitic tone of his remarks
was clear. . .My personal opinion is that
Louis Farrakhan would be much more
effective if he could restrict his points

to the uplifting of black people and his

economic philosophy.”

Lyndon Kirkland, executive assistant
director of BAS, argued against the
forums general contention that Jews
and blacks have presented a united
front in civil rights issues: “Jewish
people have been one of the biggest ex-
ploiters of black people in this coun-
try” and Jews who have worked in
black communities “take their proﬁt
back out into the suburb and build up
[their] community while the black com-
munity crumbles.” ,

Johnston here interjected, saying that
“it doesn’t matter whether you are talk-
ing about Jewish capitalists or Catholic
capitalists, you are talking about the
structure of the economy and you are
not entitled to blame one particular
group."

Commenting on Farrakhan’s pur-
ported anti-Semitism, Rashid Soundiata
asked how many of the Jewish.

members of the audience were critical
of the Israeli government’s actions as
concerns “taking the land from the
Palestinians." .

Noting how few responded positive-
ly, he said “when [Farrakhan] speaks
out against Israel. obviously many peo-
ple will get defensive.“

At this point Avery Abrams
reiterated his opening comments by
asking why Farrakhan even addressed
Israeli politics, saying, “I thought he
was here to talk economic self-help and
economic policies for blacks."

An unidentiﬁed viewer then argued
that many Afro~Americans consider
Israel as a key player in U.S. foreign
policy which promotes economic ex-
ploitation of the labor forces of third
world countries. The criticism of Israel
speciﬁcally turns around its relations
and trade with South Africa. But as a‘
major economic player in international

affairs, Israel is promoting an interna-
tional economic policy of the United
States which mirrors U.S. domestic
policies manifest in the condition of
blacks in society.

It seemed obvious that many issues
were raised which could not be ade-
quately addressed in the time span
allotted for the forum. Perhaps the most
perplexing was the mingling of
domestic issues concerning blacks,
both political and social, and U.S.
foreign policy issues concerning Israel.

Clyde Harris, chairman of the
BASICS committee of BAS, articulated
this confusion in his comments which

-closed the forum: “I feel that this after-

noon we have lost the scope of what
we are to be reﬂecting upon. The issue
here is not to defend Louis Farrakhan
but to deﬁne what is to be done now
that there is a division between black

and Jewish students here on campus.”

encounter will be a “very personal

Other world leaders are sending their
own messages about the prospects of
what the summit could bring. Pope
John Paul II is calling on Reagan and
Gorbachev to lay the groundwork for
a dialogue on war and peace at their
meetings Tuesday and Wednesday.
Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
said that while he is not sure of the out-
come, he hopes the leaders will not
forget to discuss Poland sometime dur-
ing their talks.

Spokesman Larry Speakes said that
Reagan is looking at the long range and
does not think a summit should be
judged by the number of accords
signed.

A top administration official said that
somebody in the government tried to
sabotage the summit by leaking a let-

The Pitt News, November 18, 1985

Local shop attracts collectors
of nostalgic comics, old and new

By Mary Fratis
The Pitt News

Remember the ﬁve-and-dime comic
book stores you used to see on every
corner when you were a kid?
Remember spending your allowance on
a copy of Spiderman or Superman?
While most of those shops disappeared
long ago, one of these comic book
stores has found its home in Oakland.

“The Phantom of the Attic,” a com-
ic book store at 214 South Craig St.,
carries approximately 200 new titles
every day, and ‘an estimated 1,000
issues.

Jim Weston, the owner of “The
Phantom of the Attic,” said he has
witnessedgreat changes in the business
since he opened his ﬁrst shop in
Michigan in 1981. “Marvel and
DeeCee are the largest publishers,
releasing over 60 publications each this
month,” he said. -

However, in 1983 a group of new,
independent publishing companies ap-
peared. Marvel and DeeCee had
previously promised numerous publica-
tions for the fall, but for some reason
they fell through. These new indepen-
dent publishing companies brought
about “incredible amounts of new
books,” Weston said. All of this
brought about what is referred to in the
business as “Black September.” Most
customers were accustomed to buying
the books they had always seen on the
shelves. Weston said the business “lost
many customers due to a scaling down
of purchases.” Presently the market is
back on its feet again. Weston com-

mented, “Now customers are buying

back issues as well as new products.”
‘ ‘The Phantom of the Attic” has over
70 sales daily. Over 100 people come

in and browse through the books, back
issues and collectors’ items each day.
The typical customer is hard to define.
Everyone from professionals to
students to people with trouble reading
frequents the store.

Comic books came about during the
depression. They were extremely
popular in the 1950s and ’60s. The
sales dropped radically in the late
l‘960s, however, and by the end of the
’70s they were nearly non-existent. Ac-
cording to Weston, “This may be at-

“Demographically, peo-
ple don ’t tend to travel to
shops. The shops tend to
be localized in terms of
how they draw their
customers. Each shop
serves a fairly local area.
However, for a particular
book, you are forced to
travel to locate the copy
that you want, for the price
you want to pay. ”

——Jim Weston

tributed to television and even more
importantly, the lack of outlets for
comic book sales.”

Drug stores and ﬁve-and-dime shops
used to carry mass quantities of comic
books, but they changed to selling
mostly magazines for adult audiences.
This is due to the greater proﬁt to be
made in these sales. Also, chain stores

have driven many of the small ﬁve-and-
dime stores to close, and the chain
stores just aren’t interested in selling
comic books. This inﬂuence nearly
destroyed the comic_ book market,
Weston said.

“The Phantom of the Attic” is not
the only store of its kind in Pittsburgh,
though. “Eides,”on the North Side,
sells comic books as well as records.
Pittsburgh, however, cannot compete
with such cities as Detroit, Cleveland
and Columbus when the number of
outlets is compared. Weston said that

A “Demographically, people don’t tend

to travel to shops. The shops tend to
be localized in terms of how they draw
their customers. Each shop serves a
fairly local area. However, for a par-
ticular book you are forced to travel to
locate the copy you want, for the price
you want to pay.”

Many store owners also travel to
shows where they display many collec-
tibles that sell for some farily astound-
ing prices. A mint copy of a 1940
Supemuzn I recently sold for $45,000,
setting a new record. Weston said,
“from April through Thanksgiving,
I’m on the road nearly every weekend.
I’m probably gone thirty-ﬁve to forty
weekends a year.’ ’ These shows are for
dealers, buyers and collectors, as well
as the general public.

Comic books sell for an average of
75C. The most popular one seems to
be X-Men. Yet, with such a large selec-

tion to choose from, the. customer is.

almost always able to ﬁnd a book to ﬁt
his own particular amusement.

It is so reassuring to see such a tradi- .

tional entertainment form as comic
books making an appearance on the
market again. And for a touch of
nostalgia — the “Phantom" still lurks
— on South Craig St. 1

Aiken leads Panth

The Pitt News, November 18, 1985

Sports

 

Page 15

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Pitt head basketball coach Roy Chip-
man prophesized two weeks ago when
he said, “A great deal of the success
of this basketball team will depend on

7” the play of, Curtis Aiken.”

?¥

K .

 

  
  
   
  

Well, that statement was proven true
on Saturday night when the Panthers,
behind the solid play of Aiken, defeated
the Puerto Rican National Team 84-70.

“I told Curtis that I’m not as con-
cerned with how many points he scores
as I am with how many points the team
scores,” Chipman said following the
game.

Regardless, Aiken did toss in a team-
high 17 points via a deadly jumper. He
also added ﬁve assists, which according
to Aiken, is exactly why he is out there.

“My job is to distribute the ball,”
thejunior point guard said. “My shot
felt good, but I have to be very selec-
tive.”

And that he was. If there was one
thing missing from Aiken’s game
Saturday night that was quite evident
last year, it was the twisting, driving,
out of control shots that came more
often than not during his first two years
at.Pitt. It may have been Aiken’s best
game since he has been at Pitt, and the
Pitt coaching staff could not be happier,
especially assistant coach John
Calipari, Aiken’s personal tutor, so to
speak.

‘ ‘Curtis Aiken played very
well. That is the way we
want him to play. He will
have to play like that for us
to win. ” _

—Pi-tt assistant John
Calipari g

“Curtis Aiken played very well,”
Calipari said. “That is the way we
wanthim to play. He will have to play
like that for us to win.”

Aiken made reference to Calipari
during a media luncheon last week, ex-
plaining how Calipari has pushed him
to the limit time and again. It seems to
have paid off. -

“We hope we are moving in the right

direction,” Calipari added, referring
not only to Aiken, but to the entire
squad. “We just have to keep getting
better.”

 

Nevertheless, thejury is still out. A
lack of practice time has hampered the
Panthers. They saw a lot of things
against Puerto Rico that they have not
even had a chance to practice for yet.

“Overall, there were a lot of things
that we have not even "worked on in
practice yet, and we did not judge them
on those things,” Calipari explained.
“We had not worked» against a press
that much yet. There is a great deal that
we have to work on.”

Beyond Aiken, it was not a one .man
show. - The always-steady Charles
Smith scored 16 points and cleaned the
glass for 13 rebounds. He also added
six blocked shots, all in the first half.
For a short period, it looked as if Smith
was playing ping pong instead of
basketball, swatting several Puerto
Rico shots as both teams got into a tran-
sition game. ’

Also providing a solid effort was
senior center Keith Armstrong. For a
player whose career was supposedly
over when Pitt landed Tico Cooper last
winter, he did not look too bad". Com-
ing off the bench, Armstrong scored 10
points while subbing for Cooper, who
has been bothered by a hand injury.

With Saturday’s contest being con-
sidered an exhibition game, Pitt will of-
ficially open its season when the Pan-
thers host the Westminster Titans this
Friday night at Fitzgerald Field House.
The game had originally been sched-
uled for Saturday night but was
changed so it would not conﬂict with
Saturday night’s football game between
Pittiand top-ranked Penn State‘.

Friday when he caught his left foot on

ly three out of 10 from the floor in
Saturday night’s game, but most of his
shots came from his offensive re-
bounds; he would put it back up, miss,
get another rebound and put it up again.
To say the least, Lane was impressive

The Pitt women’s swimming and

against no defeats with an 80-52 victory
over Syracuse in upstate New York.
The Lady Panthers squeezed the
Orangewomen from Syracuse in fine
fashion, winning 14 of the 16 total
events. as they won their 12th con-
secutive regular—season meet. -

“We know their team pretty well."
head coach Dave Belowich said.
“They have a history of swimming
well against us, and we knew that. The
girls took it into their own hands and
just dominated the meet."

Leading the way for the Lady Pan-

thers was New York native Jodi

O’Neil. The junior from Webster’

placed first in three events, setting a
pool record in one. O’Neil’s time of
2:24.58 in the 200-meter breast stroke
was the best ever at Syracuse in that

event. O‘Neil also led the pack in the ‘

200-meter individual medley, and was
part of Pitt’s triumphant 200-meter
relay team. 2

McRae is a legitimate
All-America for Pitt

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Lee McRae, Pitt’s sophomore All-
America sprinter. will embark on
another promising season on Nov. 25
arid 26 when Pm holds its Blue—Gold
Track and Field Meet at Fitzgerald
Field House.

McRae is coming off an outstanding
freshman season which included gain-
ingIAll-America status. McRae gained
his All-America honors at the NCAA
Indoor Championships with a sixth-
place ﬁnish in the 60-meter dash with
a time of 6:26. He also ﬁnished fifth
in this event at the Big East Outdoor
Championships. McRae set the school

record in the 55—meter, 100-meter and A

200-meter events.

At the Big East Outdoor Champion-
ships this past May at Villanova
University, McRae was named the
Men's Outstanding Performer with a
ﬁrst-place ﬁnish in the 200-meter (time
of 20:99) and a second-place ﬁnish in
the 100-meter (10:41). His tremendous
freshman season was capped‘ off with
a forth-place ﬁnish in the 100-meter at
the National Sports Festival this past
summer.

With one year of college experience
behind him, McRae will only improve,
according to head coach John Vasvary.
“For Lee, conﬁdence is still real im-
portant. He is from the backwoods of
North Carolina; and when he came to
Pitt he was somewhat awed at first
when competing against some of the
top-name runners. This year Lee is so
much more experienced, and that will
really help him.”

Sprinter coach Steve Lewis agrees,

“There is a ﬁne line with talented run-
ners. The great runners have to have
mental strength. Lee was so young last
year, but he has grown and developed
a lot in that area [mental strength].”

With aperformer like McRae the
Panther track team will assuredly do
well. They hope to improve on last
year’s fourth-place Big East finish.
Coach Vasvary warns not to key on
McRae alone: “Lee was our most
valuable runner as a freshman, but he
is not the lone ingredient to our suc-
cess. Overall, this will be the best team
we’ve had since I’ve been here. We
have the capability to do very well in
the Big I East. We parallel the Pitt
basketball team in the fact that we
recruited some athletes we weren’t ex-
pected to get, and now we are moving

' up in the league.”

Beyond his physical abilities, last
year McRae showed what a team-
oriented performer he is. Coach
Vasvary remembers the incident well.
“At last year’s Big East Champion-
ships one of our quarter-rnile relay run-
ners got cramps during" warm ups. Lee
was sitting in the stands eating a hot
dog, and Igcalled him down and asked
him to run. He had never run a quarter-
mile race before, and he had already
run ﬁve races that day. But all he said
to me was ‘pin on my number.’ He
went out and ran a-very good time, and
we placed third in the race. That showed
what kind of kid he is, Lee is deﬁnite-
ly a team man.”

McRae has all the talent in the world,
but there is room for improvement.
“Lee has to control his speed. That is
the most important area for him,” said
Lewis.

Penn State quarterback John Shaffer

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

While Penn State cruised to a 36-6
win over Notre Dame this weekend to
preserve their No. 1 ranking. no one
watched the game with as much interest
as Pitt head coach Foge Fazio.

The Panthers will host the 10-0 Nit-
tany Lions this Saturday night at Pitt
Stadium before a sellout crowd.

"We all watched [Penn State vs.
Notre Dame] with a lot of interest."
said Fazio. "We've been watching
them the past three or four games. And
right now. they are the best team in the
country. They proved it against Notre
Dame." '

Penn State impressed Fazio in all
categories. "I thought defense was
their strong suit." said Fazio. “It was
outstanding against Notre Dame. But
their kicking game will drive you
crazy."

Fazio knows what a good kicking

game can do for a club and  3 poor’ '

one can hurt a team. Mark Brasco has
struggled for the Panthers. connecting
on only five of 13 field goal attempts.

Penn State kicker Massimo Manco
equalled Brasco‘s season output in one
game, as the senior boomed five field
goals against Notre Dame. including a
50-yarder.

Offense is an area where Penn State
has improved. according to Fazio.
Earlier this season, Penn State quarter-
back John Schaffer was eratic in

leading his team to narrow wins over
the likes of Rutgers, Syracuse and
Boston College.

"Their quarterback has confidence
now." Fazio said. "The teamhas been
driving the ball lately. and [D.J.]
Dozier has been running the ball real
well."

Shaffer was only 7-16 for 126 yards
against the Irish, but the junior from
Cincinnati looked in charge. On Penn
State’s first possession Saturday, Shaf-
fer looked particularly effective in
leading the Lions to a 79-yard
touchdown drive, which was conclud-
ed with a nifty 21-yard scoring play to

Dozier._ _

watching the game to see possible

weaknesses in Penn State. the fourth— 

year Pitt coach was happy with the
outcome.

"1 was rooting for Penn State."
Fazio said. "I want them to win every
game but the last one. We wanted them
coming in undefeated. There‘s no
doubt about it." Fazio is hoping to
crush the Lions’ dream of a national

_ championship come Saturday. in a

game that will be televised nationally
by ESPN.

Pitt has some paying back to do to
Penn State. In 1981, Penn State upset
unbeaten and top-ranked Pitt 48-14 in

Pitt Stadium. The following year, Pitt "A

could have returned the favor, but the
Panthers lost 19-10 to Penn State in the
Lions‘ national championship season.

"This will be the best Penn State
team we’ played since their 1982
team,” Fazio said. “They have been

getting better and bet er all year, and , ,

r10‘l*f{l“iey are the best team in the na-
tion.“

Pitt, at only 5-4-1, has one last
chance to salvage its season. A victory
this Saturday would be its sweetest
since the 21-16 victory at Notre Dame
in 1983. The task is a large one, but
Pitt has the talent to stay competitive.
The biggest edge Pitt has will be the
home-field advantage.

“Hopefully, with the game being a
night game, it will add to the emotion,"
said Fazio. “It did against Purdue, and
it did when we played at Ohio State.”

on Saturday. The Lady Panthers had
four other double winners: Sue

Hickman, Marian Cassidy, Tricia .-‘*=;.V

Rickert and Tricia Ney. Cassidy pro-
vided the most exciting single perform-
ance of the meet when she came from
behind to win the 800-meter freestyle
relay.

Trailing by a half of a pool length
when she entered the water, Cassidy
swam a personal best 1252.8 split and
touched out first.

“That kind of stuff went on race after
race after race,” Belowich said. “That
is what kind of day it was for us.” He
added, “I am very pleased with the
team. We work very hard, but we are
having fun. That is what it is all
about.”

The win was Belowich’s 25th at Pitt,
and it comes at an appropriate time,
with perhaps the best team he has ever
had here at Pitt. _

“They are not afraid to race,’
Belowich said of his troops. “They
have shown what they can do when the
pressure is on, and they have shown
what they can do when they are ex-
pected to do well.”
