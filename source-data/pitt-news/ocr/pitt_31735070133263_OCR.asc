Raising the arlsince 1906

VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 62

BRANDON WALOFF/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

James Carmine talks to Channel 11 reporter Andy Gastmeyer at last night’s Republican election celebration. Carmine
acknowledged a loss to incumbent Tom -Murphy in Pittsburgh’s mayoral race, but said he is doing good. things for the city.

College Republicans host  
Downtown election shindig

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

Republican mayoral candidate Jim
Carmine holds no illusions about his
fate in the Nov. 6 elections. “I’m los-
ing the election,” he said, “but I’m
going to win in terms of what I’m
doing for the city.

Carmine sat at a small table in the

1 middle of a Tuesdaynight party spon— »
: sored by Mary Jane Bowes and Jill

Rangos, both Republicans running for
judicial seats.
Tuesday’s party, held in the

‘Monongahela Room of the Omni

William Penn Hotel Downtown, did
not draw as many attendees as the one
‘last year. Still, Nick Havens, president
of Pitt’s College Republicans, said
that there was a “good turnout for a
judicial race.” .

Decorated with red, white and
blue balloons, on which “Mary Jane
Bowes for Superior Court” was writ-

ten, the room soon filled with those
running for office, their friends and

‘family, and Republicans from Pitt and

Carnegie Mellon University.

As men and women in dark suits
mingled, sipping from glasses and
munching on cheese and vegetable
slices, candidates and their staffs cir-
culated through the crowd.

Both Bowes and Rangos attended
to celebrate the end of their campaigns
for Superior Court and the Court of
Common Pleas, respectively.

Bowes, dressed in a narrow blue
suit ornamented with an American
ﬂag pin, spoke of hergoals if she
should win.

Citing her “strict constructionist”
philosophy, she paused to hug Mike
Fisher, Pennsylvania’s attorney gener-
al and a Republican gubernatorial
hopeful in the 2002 election. Fisher
heartily endorsed Bowes, and the two
smiled tiredly — having spent all day
visiting the polls —-— at nearby televi-

sion cameras.

Both politicians worked previous-
ly with the College Republicans.
Havens cited his close involvement
with Bowes in the race for the judge-
ship, saying, “I’ve met Mary Jane
many times...we were very active in
Mary Jane’s campaign.” Early in the
night, Havens predicted both that both
Bowes and Rangos would prove victo-
rious.

College Republicans also manned
the polls on Election Day.

‘But voter turnout was low. “I
worked the polls from 7 to 9 this
morning. I didn’t see a single person,”
said Kevin Krauland, a Pitt sopho-
more.

Even so, the mood was one of sub-
dued enthusiasm. After “Can’t Get
Enough of Your Love,” played loudly
in the background, Pitt senior Ed

~Lepczyk said, “They were playing

Barry White and that just makes a
party.”

 

Student reports
being raped in

South Oakland
apartment

EUGENE CRoss & CHARLOTTE TUCKER
Staff Report

A woman reported to city police
Friday that she was raped in her South
Oakland home last month. I

In the police report, the woman said

that the suspect, who she has known for V

three years, came to her home on Oct. 10
and suggested they go out and buy some
wine. , »

The woman, who requested that sh
not be identiﬁed, said she and the man
ﬁnished the bottle of wine while looking
at photo albums. She also reported hav-
ing two or three shots of liquor.

She said that the man approached
her as she lay on her bedroom ﬂoor in a
state of serni—consciousness and began to
kiss her.

According to the police report, she
turned her head to the side in an attempt
to stop him, but he removed her pants
and underwear, as well as his own pants
and underwear. The woman told police
that she then asked him, “What are you
doing?” to which he responded, “It’s
OK, it’s only sex.”

The report said that the suspect then
placed himself on top of her and began to
have sex with her.

According to the report, the woman
then shouted, “This is wrong, and you
have to get the f——— off of me and leave.”
The suspect then stood and left.

The woman said she waited 23 days
to call the police because, “I just wanted
to black it out, to forget.”

She said it was only after she heard
rumors about a sexual relationship
between herself and the man that she
decided to come forward with her side of
the story.

“About two weeks after it, I heard
the rumors and decided it was time I

. spoke out about it,” she said.

She said she and her boyfriend visit-
ed Pitt’s Sexual Assault Services to get
counseling after the incident, and the
counselor there urged her to report the
incident to the Pitt police. The Pitt police,

Pitt peace group hosts expert on Islam

MELANIE DONAHOO
Staff Writer I

In the beginning, God‘ created
Adam and Eve and they sinned.-
but it wasn’t entirely Eve’s fault.

This is’ one of the beliefs of
Islam, according to Kadir Gunduz,
director of the Islamic Center of
Pittsburgh. Gunduz shared this and

’ many other Islamic beliefs and foun-

dations at an informal talk sponsored
by Pitt for Peace.

Held Tuesday night in the
Kurtzman Room of the William Pitt
Union, students and other members
of the University community had the
opportunity to ask Gunduz "questions
about Islam. Gunduz also gave a gen-
eral introduction to the Islam.

“There is no deity of worship but
God,” Gunduz said. “Once you
define God and submit to him, you

~ don’t submit to anyone or anything

else.” ’ ,
Gunduz cited three main con-

‘ cepts as fundamental parts of Islam.
I First is the belief in the existence and

oneness of God. Gunduz noted that

. Muslims don’t believe God is any

one gender, but use “He” when refer-

‘ ring to God simply because of lan-

guage restrictions.
Secondly, Muslims believe that
God created everyone and every-

- thing. And finally, Muslims believe '

that people are born, live and die, and
will be resurrected in either a par-
adise or a hell.

Gunduz also related aspects of
Islam to those of Christianity. He
noted that although Muslims believe
that Adam and Eve sinned and were
banished to the earth, they both had

an equal part in the sin. According to,

Gunduz, Muslims believe in no orig-
inal sin —-Adam and Eve repented
and were forgiven.

Another major aspect of Islam is
the belief in prophets. According to
Gunduz, all messages from God are

- sent through humans who are chosen
as messengers or prophets. The .

prophets then deliver God’s message
to the people. Gunduz noted that the
last prophet of the Islamic religion
was Muhammad.

Gunduz talked about the Five
Pillars of Islam, how Muslims view
sin and their concept of God. Also,

I _ Gunduz noted that the Islamic faith

does not encourage followers to con-

‘ vert others to their religion.
“The religion is in your heart and V ,
you cannot change your heart,” ,

Gunduz said.

_Gunduz also addressed the role
of women in Islamic society.
Muslims believe that women are
individuals and should be treated as

such. Gunduz said that Muslim

' women weren’t allowed to inherit
property or possessions until Islam

condoned it.

According to Gunduz, culture is a '

major factor in how women are treat-

ed in many Muslim countries. He i‘
said there are certain parts of both a '
man’s and woman’s body that should i

be covered at all times, and this is the
reason many women wear _veils in
public. It is a part of the culture.

But Gunduz noted that oppres-

sive regimes such as the Taliban are .

simply trying to mimic countries like

Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia believes
in separation of the sexes in many
aspects, of life but can afford to pro-

vide facilities such as schools and-’

colleges for women as well as men.
The Taliban, Gunduz said, cannot
afford to implement such ideas so the
men are given the benefits in society.

Fundamentalism, according to

' Gunduz, is not strictly a Taliban idea,

but it can be applied to any ideology.
“Fundamentalism is a mind—set,”
he said. “It dehumanizes others, it is
a dehumanization of self.”
Mindi Guidas, president of Pitt

for Peace, organized the talk to edu-
cate people about Islam. She said that
although thereare four million Arab-
Americans in the United States, only
one million practice Islam.

Guidas and others founded Pitt
for Peace inresponse to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. '

“Most Pitt students probably
grew up under some form of
Christianity,” she said. “People are
afraid of cultures and religions they
haven’t been exposed to. I just want-
ed to try and break down some
stereotypes.” A

Minister mixes hip—hop, black consciousness  

KATIE LEONARD
The Pitt News

Dr. Benjamin Muhammad, a min-
ister involved with the Hip-Hop

_ Summit Action Network, spoke at Pitt

as part of Black Action Society’s
“Black Week: A Week of Atonement,
Reconciliation and Responsibility.”

Muhammad, an active member of
the black community, has been
involved with other groups and activ-
ities including the NAACP and the
Million Man March. . I

“After Sept. 11, we all should b
focused on what we should be doing
to increase the quality of our lives and
the lives of those around us,” he said.

Muhammad spoke about change:
those that have already taken place
and those that still need to be
addressed. But he asked the audience,
“Have things really changed? Has
racism changed? Has racial profiling
changed?”

He said the government should
look at itself before it takes action
against all terrorists.

“If President George Bush is
against terrorism, he needs to be
against all terrorism,” he said.

Calling the slave trade a “terrorist
attack” in North American history,
Muhammad said, “We cannot say we
did not know terrorism before Sept.
11.” ’

Now he uses hip—hop, something
he called “a powerful cultural phe-
nomenon,” because he “found out that
hip—hop has the attention and mind of
our young people.” ‘

The organizations that he works
with recognize that the hip—hop com-
munity must “take responsibility for
what they’re saying...music, videos
and the reactions they receive.”

As a result of that work, HBO has
agreed: to air a new show called “Def
Poetry Jam.”

' Organizations such as the
NAACP promote the interests of the
black community. But. Muhammad

said the companies that help to
finance it hold back that progress.

He encouraged the black commu-
nity to become more involved, saying
that “last year we spent $60 million as
consumers...and we don’t even fund
our organizations.”

“In fact, we are seeking funding,”
he said. “Does a slave ask a master to
fund an escaped slave?”

Muhammad talked about the
Million Man March, which he helped
organize. As a result of the march,
Muhammad said the “black—on—black”
crime rate, the high school dropout
rate among blacks and the black

incarceration rate all went down.

_ The black man’s struggles,
though, are not over, Muhammad
said. The “struggle is not for a day,
it’s not for a week, it’s not for a
month, it’s for the rest of our lives.”

According to him, many blacks
remain in a “comfort zone” and need
to recognize that it is a “privilege to
be enrolled at the University of
Pittsburgh, because there are many
challenges.”

In order for blacks to remove
themselves from this comfort zone,
he encourages a “reoccurring black
consciousness movement.”

in turn, notiﬁed city police.

The woman is not sure yet whether
she will press charges.

“I just don’t want this to happen
again,” she said. “I know it happens on
campus with alcohol and friends. But
maybe if someone in the same situation
sees this they’ll realize they’re not the
only ones.”

E SGB meeting...or circus?

Monday night’s Student Government
Board meeting was a circus, but no one was
amused.

Board member Michelle Agostini
introduced resolution 0010, which called
for the automatic appointment of two mern-
bers of “historically under—represented [sic]
groups” to each of the selection committees,
which appoint chairpersons for the other
committees.

The same resolution also claims that
the needs and concems of underrepresented
groups were “completely igno ” and pro-
posed creation of a “Multicultural Advisory
Council” that would “ensure the representa-
tion of all students, especially students from
historically under-represented [sic] commu-
nities on campus.”

While the intentions of Agostini and
Asian Student Alliance, Black Action
Society and Campus Women’s
Organization, all of whom co-sponsored the
resolution, were laudable — the comrrrittees
and the board itself should be representative
of the student body — this resolution calls for
the wrong plan of action.

' First, it fails to deﬁne what constitutes a
historically underrepresented group. It also
fails to deﬁne who chooses those who
would serve on such a Multicultural
Advisory Council.

This proposed resolution, although
vague, would create a non-elected oversight
committee for the representatives of the stu-
dent body.

The resolution was not nearly speciﬁc
enough concerning said council’s powers,
its constitution or its selection. If the board
is going to guarantee two seats to underrep-
resented groups, why not guarantee all of
them? The board, should the resolution be
extended to it, is too small to accommodate
representatives of every group.

Thankfully, the board voted it down 6-
1.

The conduct of the meeting itself was
honid. President Jeff Alex’s official proto-
col dictates that board members receive
copies of resolutions at least 24 hours in
advance and meetbefore each public meet-
mg.

Why then couldn’t SGB have met col-
lectively to draft a doctunent that each
member could support?

Instead, the board aired all of its inter-
nal strife at a public meeting when this
could have easily been avoided with a little
teamwork.

Agostini and the rest of the board, who,
even in voting against her resolution, said
they supported reaching out to minority
groups, are right. SGB is supposed to repre-
sent the entire student body. VV1th this man-
date, its members should not show them-
selves to be a group of clowns.

There are better ways for BAS, ASA
and CWO to achieve their objectives than
trying to institute change within SGB. This
circus accomplished little and was nothing
more than a Charade.

Lowering drinking age would curb
binge drinking, other problems

For 15 years America has enforced a
completely arbitrary drinking age.

According to the N CADI Technical
Report, a govemment—run health organi-

and 20 caught driving under the inﬂu-
ence declined eight percentage points

George W. Bush is a big fat stupid-
head.

Does this statement say anything
about my criticisms of our president’s
views on the death penalty, his attitudes
concerning social welfare and poverty or

‘ creative use of the word “folks?” Nope.

This statement is not only not true —
we_ can see on television that his head is

I small, shrunken and resembles that of an

ugly, Old World monkey —' but that
insult too does nothing to prove my point.
It’s petty, it’s personal, and it is just one
instance of people letting their arguments
get in the way of their points. '

Debating is an art form that involves ,

a certain amount of tact and class.
Restraint acts as the key difference
between discussing something in .a
mature manner and an all—out hair-
pulling, mudslinging, Jenny Jones—style
tl1row—down. ‘

Attacking someone’s actions, public
statements and the image he or she pro-
jects can- all be part of a calm, well-rea-
soned argument. Sounding like 2-year-
olds ﬁghting over a red plastic shovel in
a sandbox before nappy time carmot.
There’s a hair—thin line between politi-
cians and preschoolers, but it’s one that
needs to be observed.

In the 1950s, Sen. Joe McCarthy
took to calling those left of the political
center pinkos, commies, reds, etc. These
labels came with the implication that
those associated with colors of a rosy
Variety also held ties with the USSR. Yet
because McCarthy had no concrete evi-
dence against the accused he resorted to
the language of the playground.

Currently, those who do not favor
bombing Afghanistan have been slapped

with labels such as anti-Americans, I

unpatriotic or simply hippies. While sep-
arating the seeming “us” from the “them”
and thus polarizing arguments is often
used to win debates, these charges deny
the accused the ability to respond.
Moreover, pinning false labels on
people to get an emotional rise out of
them is self-defeating. By attacking a

person, and not their reasoning, those ,

placing the false labels lose their credibil-
ity. A S

For instance, juxtaposing those ;pro-
and anti—war as heroes and hippies,

-respectively, does not take into account

the breadth and depth of the situation.
Not all people in favor of air strikes and

V “strategic targeting” are imbued with
. courage and vigor. Not all those opposed

are dreadlocked tie-dye wearing Grateful
Dead fans.

And even if the former were all
Captain Americas and the latter all Abby

' Hoffman look—alikes, their views would

not fall together in lockstep formation.
Thus poking fun at the tights—wearing
superheroes or those who scorn personal
hygiene accomplishes little.

Plus, mocking and (lending them

spaghetti. It adds nothing and
only distracts from the actual
meat of the argument.
Name—calling, while
funny when watching the
Yankees lose the World
Series or commenting on a
beluga whale of a Jerry
Springer guest, is not what
the great debates of the world
are made of. The stuff of true
discourse probably should
not involve the comments on

the opposing side’s weight, hairdo or the

size of their craniums.

Living wage doesn’t
mean inﬂation

I’m‘continually shocked by how many
people buy intothe capitalist propaganda of
gigantic multinationals such as the
Sodexho Alliance. The common attack
against a living wage is that prices will have
to inherently 

As it stands, it costs $4.85 to get one
sliceofpizzaandasodaatEddie’s.Ican
only think of two possible explanations:
Either they are using some sort of rare, aged

French cheese and the Pepsi is of prime
vintage, or Sodexho is making massive
proﬁts. A living wage would simply dip
into those proﬁts. The Sodexho Alliance
turned a $1.2 billion proﬁt last year.
Raising the salaries of a few thousand
workers by a few dollars per hour would
not plunge this business into bankruptcy.
The only reason food prices would go up
would be if Sodexho puts greed over
humanity and feels that it must retain this
outrageous proﬁt margin and take it out on
the consumer. i
The oﬂier argument — that a living

wage would result in massive inﬂa1ion—— is
only defended by the most conservative of
economists, and I have yet to see any cred-
ible evidence presented. Yes, a living wage
interferes with the ﬂee market economy —
which is an innocent name for a system
where proletarian labor power can be
exploited at the whim of the capitalists -

but so do. minimum wages and labor.

unions. .

There was no remarkable inﬂation that
can be pointed to as being caused by the
implementation and numerous subsequent
increases of the federal minimum wage, so

how would a gradual rollout of a living
wage be dilferent? .

And who knows? Perhaps as the living
wage phenomenon snowballs, Americans
will realize that there are things more
important that the black—and-white proﬁt
margin. Could it be that this newly found
sense of compassion would actually lead, to
a non—exploitative, socialist government?
I’ll take it one step at a time, with solidarity
forever. __ -

where his or her next meal will come
from is more likely to overeat than a per-
son who knows food will always be
available. The same applies to alcohol.
_ By enforcing such restrictive drink-
ing laws, the government only heightens
the allure of alcohol_ among minors.
What could be a controlled activity
becomes a forbidden game, much like
smoking cigarettes in high school. i
The American government is not in
the habit of forbidding any potentially
dangerous activities. Certain unrestricted
risks are a fundamental part of liberty;
Traffic accidents in general are far more
frequent among drivers under 25 — their
judgment simply has not reached the
level of the average 30-year-old. Yet we
, still extend the privilege of driving to 16-
, year-olds. Diving, like drinking, is not a

natural right, but as a free nation, we
. believe all adults deserve the privilege.

Not every 18-year-old is ready to
handle drinking responsibly. But neither
is every 21-year-old. Nor every 45-year-
old. If our nation is going to accept the
use of alcohol among any age group —
as the_ﬁasco of Prohibition in the 1920s
proved we must — we carmot expect
some arbitrarily-selected age limit ‘ to
enforce controlled drinking. At 18 we
recognize individuals as mature adults.

Based on that, a drinking age of 18_

would make sense.

‘Assassins’ portrays
humanity’s indecency

Our Lady of the Assassins
(La Virgen de los Sicarios)
Starring German Jaramillo,

Anderson Ballesteros, Juan David A

Restrepo

Directedby Barbet Schroeder
Written by Fernando Vallejo
iriktkt/2

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE
Staff Writer

In a time when pop culture largely-

determines cinema, ‘it’s not often that a ﬁlm
can successfully implicate commercialism
while its main focus sticks to pointing out the
ineffectual dominance of the church.

Barbet Schroeder’s “Our Lady of the
Assassins” (“La Virgen de los Sicarios”) ups

. the ante of presenting a morally degraded

society —- not unlike pop culture —— by
revealing a world so strongly aifected by
materialism and Catholicism that, since.it’s
in poverty, competition becomes so callous-
ly violent that it’s not just about money any-
more, it’s about survival.

Like Luis Bunuel’s “The Young and the
Damn ” (“Los Olvidados”), Schroeder
depicts the hopeless existence of the unloved

children of the metropolis, showing the
absurdity and frequency of their deaths and
pointing out the ungovemmentability of a
land to whom the bourgeois “presidente”
still makes empty promises. Schroeder
employs the sort‘ of surrealistic touchesthat
Bunuel made a lifetime worth of ﬁlms with,
as ominous gun battles often feature faceless
shooters on the back of motorbikes, and our
hero, in relation to his conscious dwellings,
often dreams of moving through tombs and
places of the dead.

As opposed to Bunuel’s Mexico,
“Assassins” is set" in a further removed
Colombia, which is possibly even more
affected by capitalist America. The ﬁlm
opens as rniddle—aged homosexual Fernando
(German Jaramillo) picks up Alexis
(Anderson Ballesteros). In addition to a sex-
ual relationship, Femando takes the boy into
his care, nurturing and providing for him.
Together they wander through the city of
Medellin, _ often witnessing * brutal shootouts

between gangs of boys not unlike Alexis. Of a

course, Alexis ﬁnds status in his gun as well,
oﬂing anyone who even remotely annoys or
hassles him or his new benefactor.

Alexis’ wanton slayings speciﬁcally
shock Fernando, forcing him to examine just
what the never-ending cycle of violence and
murder has escalated to since his days as a
thug for Pablo Esoobar. But more irr1portant-
ly to Femando is what the churches have
become an excuse for: bodily solicitation
and the ritualistic ﬁx of the junkie.

“Assassins” seems to ﬁnd its center in

presenting the church as the empty shell of
"obligation that it has become, ironic in its
remaining prevalence during holidays, while
a new religion has been born out of murder
and self-preservation. As Femando observes,
“It’s not us and them, it’s us or them.”
Fernando, like Jesus in “The Last
Temptation of Christ,” is in constant conﬂict
over the worth of people and things around
him. But Femando is further along in his dis-
illusionment, and rather than Martin

Scorsese’s “Christ,” he ﬁnds hirnselfas a sort
of patron saint to these young feignless
killers; indeed, the “lady of the assassins.”

By the end, Femando moves sadly
about ﬂie city like a spectre of morality that
time caught up with, wondering what his
place could possibly be in a seemingly god-
less world. After being exposed to such a dis-
parate, poisoned place, we too are left won-

Musical is better off dead

Grand Hotel

Through Nov. 18

The Pittsburgh Playhouse

S HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

There are musicals that year after year draw large
crowds and earn the big bucks: “Les Miserables,” “Cats,”
“Rent,” “Chicago” and “Phantom of the Opera” And there
are other musicals that, for one reason or another, did not
have the staying power.

It’s quite possible that some of them were condemned to
obscurity unfairly. But it’s equally plausible that the court of

popular opinion judged wisely. Right now, at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, a musicalhas been raised from the dead — and
the corpse is a little stiif. ’

“Grand Hotel,” originally a showcase movie of stars like
Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, looks back with nostalgia
on pre-Hitler Berlin in all its decadence. In the musical, the
showcase aspect remains, and every song is a
20-minute medley giving as many actors as
possible a minute in the spotlight. For an open-
ing number this is standard musical procedure.
For a two—hour musical (without intermission), it’s boring.

Not that the cast doesn’t try to entertain us, but that only
makes the show’s errors more glaringly obvious. Scott J .
Pearson does the best job at making his character, the poor
thief and aristocrat Baron Felix Von Vaigem, believable.
Deanna Martin has an adorable turn as Flaemmchen, a typ-
ist with big Hollywood dreams. In fact, all the lead actors are
endearing, but since every single one is playing a character
that’s predictable and one-sided, it’s hard not to be angry with
them for wasting their — and our — time.

Perhaps if the show had been completely lighthearted,
with the usual one or two major conﬂicts, its revival could be

understood. After all, “Carousel,” perhaps the most mediocre ‘

Watch

of Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, still pops up on
Broadway. But the fact that “Grand Hote ” makes a pathetic
attempt to address social issues seals its fate as a ridiculous
relic of the past _ i

The plight of the working class is summed up by three
sweaty-looking men in aprons who sing, “Some have, some
have not” There is no further exploration of
the subject aside from that

Even stranger, ﬂue musical half-heartedly
explores homosexuality: An uptight
concierge’s (Tanner Outly) attitude problem is written off as
repressed homosexual desires, and a ballerina’s conﬁdante
(Betsy Padamonsky) sings a song of unrequited love to her
ﬁiend while, it is implied, watching her friend make love to
a man. .
True, the modernist set by Karl Brake is beautiful in its
metallic curves and unobtrusive enough to host many loca-
tions throughout the hotel, and the musicians directed by
David Pressau handle the score masterfully.

But although director Niki Harris manages to give
“Grand Hotel” the illusion of coherence — quite a feat -
when a show is created merely to give stars face time, it usu-
ally turns out that there’s not much to see.

It takes guts to name your band
Garbage. The results of such nomenclature
can be one of two possible outcomes e
either the name accurately describes their
musical efforts or it becomes a deﬁning
ironic statement.

VV1th beautzﬁalgarbage, Garbage con-
tinues to make an ironic statement. The disc
opens with “Shut Your Mouth,” which sets
the pace for the rest of the album. Most of
the songs follow the same lyrical structure
of the typical pop song: various verses that
are tied together by a common refrain or
hook. This is where the comparison to the
cookie—cutter world of pop music ends.

The lyrics of beautrﬁllgarbage come
across as raw and unadulterated, a refresh-
ing change .from the shallow, overcautious
and overwritten lyrics that seem to make up
the bulk of music these days. These honest
lyrics actually mean something, dealing
with everything from lost love to gender
identity and everything in between.

But lyrics are only half the package.
Luckily the accompanying music more
than meets the high standards set by the
vocals. Synths, guitars, drums — every-
thing comes together with the lyrics to cre-
ate a sound that can only be described as
addictive.

The entire disc comes across with a dis-
tinct feeling of studio polish. This keeps the
songs from being rough on the edges ‘with-

The liner notes of Annika Bentley’s
newest album with leak, blink, & breath con-
tain a picture of her in a closet lit by one
hanging bare light bulb. This picture serves
as an apt metaphor for Bentley’s music.
Though at ﬁrst glaring and harsh, ultimately
it is illuminating.

Bentley’s music is destined to be com-
pared to that of Ani Difranco and especially
Tori Amos — not necessarily a bad thing
considering their inﬂuence and stature in the
Lilith Fair crowd at which Bentley’s music is
aimed. Both she and Amos feature the piano
prominently in their music; it serves as a
complicated backdrop for their mournful
lyrics.

“Fall is Coming” opens with the sen-
tence, “Choose which sarcophagus wants
more to let me lie, as good as corpiscola, like
the good pocket calculator girls and I know
l’ll be closing my eyes and I can’t even

out sounding overproduced, giving the
songs a sense of finality and completion.
This was absent from previous albums.

All this doesn’t come without a price
though. The only problem with the disc is
that it lacks a commonality that pulls all the
tracks together into a total package. The
pace shifts from dark and moody songs like
“Cup of Coffee” to the pounding and much

more up tempo “Silence Is Golden?’ and '

leave.” But don’t be deterred; Though dense,
her lyrics are also often beautiful and strik-
mg.

But Bentley is not merely an Amos imi-
tator. Indeed, she combines aspects of other
prominent female singers and adds her own
touches to her music. One song,
“Pedicellaria,” is reminiscent of Sarah
McLachlan, with more artistic vision, if less
reﬁnement ,

Probably the most original and innova-
tive song on the album, “Seaward” has
musical editorial markings printed as the
lyrics in the album’s liner notes. That is to
say, the dynamics, styles and phrasing one
would follow if playing the wordless piece,
dominated not by her piano but by strings.

The album is somewhat inconsistent,
explained by the fact that she is only 20. But
for someone so young, her artistic voice is
mature‘ and sophisticated. Some of her songs

now so you can say you did before she was
trendy. '

“Cherry Lips” with little to no transition

between them. While this is a small ﬂaw, it .

is still quite noticeable.
Despite its minor imperfections, this is
a disc that proves that the musical efforts of
Garbage are anything but trash. If you like
their previous efforts, you’ll ﬁnd this album
more than to your liking. And if you don’t,
this album is a great place to start.

THE BEST PIACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS-

P PAG 2

  ’iExpectations

weren’t set too
high for Pitt

  

Spears Vmw

Kenneth Paul

On Saturday Pitt football did what
many would say was the unthinkable.
They beat Virginia Tech.

Pitt fans were ﬁlled with different ,

emotions. Some fans were thrilled.
Others were shocked and some just
relieved. I, on the other hand, was sim-
ply satisﬁed. Satisﬁed that the team
finally showed what they were capable
of doing all season long. '

Back in late August, when people
were chatting about the upcoming sea-
son, they asked me what I thought
about the team and how they would do.
At the time, it was my pleasure to relay
to anybody that would listen that this
team would be right up at the top of the
Big East, with as many as eight wins.

These were my expectations as a
person who has covered the team for a
long time and as a fan..These expecta-
tions were held by a majority of people,
including all of the so-called experts.

Expectations don’t mean a thing.
They are not tangible, yet people hold
them‘ dear and take‘ them seriously.
While fans and reporters were playing
the hype ﬂute all over the land, Walt
Harris was downplaying all the music
or rather noise.

During camp and around campus,
the team showed a conﬁdence that had
never been seen before — it seemed to
believe, but it was hard to tell how deep
or shallow the conﬁdence was. That
conﬁdence was zapped following the
loss to South Florida.

It was a blow from a 100-pound ﬁst
driving its way into the team’s stomach
that knocked the wind out of the team.
The team was on life support for more
than a month and ﬂat lined at Boston
College.

Hoyas endPitt’s season  

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The men’s soccer season and six—game
unbeaten streak came to an end last night
when they fell to Georgetown 1-O.

Georgetown’s Kevin Sindelar scored
the only goal of the game as he headed a
pass from Tony Soric past Panthers’ goal-
keeper Justin Gaul. The goal came at 26
minutes, 8 seconds into the game.

It was a closely-fought game overall
as the Hoyas outshot the Panthers 10 to
nine. The Panthers had their share of
chances to tie the game, but the Hoyas’
defense began tightening as the game pro-
gressed.

The Hoyas’ goalkeeper, Brian
O’Hagan, had four "saves for the game.
O’Hagan proved to be an important factor. ‘ ‘  A‘ ’
in the Georgetown win. The Panthers had
nine corner kicks, but none got past 

The Panthers’ Jeff Krause and Peter
Veltri led the team with two shots apiece.

WES BRYANT/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Senior forward Peter Veltri tied forthe team lead with two shots in the
Panthers’ 1-0 loss to Georgetown. Jeff Krause also had two attempts on goal.

    

With the loss, the Panthers ﬁnished the

. season with a record of 6-8-3 and 2-6-2 in

the Big East. —

Last night was more than just a ﬁnale
to the men’s season. The game also marked
the end of ﬁve Panthers’ careers as Mark '
Sikora, Chris Churchill, Jorge Rivera and
Veltri-played their ﬁnal collegiate games.

Men’s head coach Joe Luxbacher had

nothing but praise for his seniors and what

they meant to the team. “They were a good
bunch of men and they gave it their all,” he

‘said.

Luxbacher felt bad that the season
ended the way it did. He felt especially

badly for the seniors.

“There 'wasn’t pretty much to say after
the game to them. Everyone was pretty
hurt about the end,” he said. . 7

Last night’s game was arreven game
in Luxbacher’s eyes. “We had our chances
during the game, but we just didn’t capital-
ize,” Luxbacher said.

This season’s schedule was difﬁcult
for the Panthers’ according to Luxbacher
since he felt that the earlier part of the sea-
son was rather tough for a team that was
mainly made up of underclassmen.

“There were high‘ expectations going
into the season,” he "said. “We pretty much

took a risk with scheduling a difficult
schedule. A lot of freshmen were thrown
into the ﬁre, but we felt it was worth it.”

With all the young talent that the
Panthers have returning next year,
Luxbacher thinks that there is nothing but
room for improvement.

“We have a solid group returning even '

though we are losing some key guys. The
Big East is a tough conference, so recruit-
ing is going-to be of importance, going into

next season,” he said. “The players that are '

coming back will now have to work hard-
er so that we will have a good season next

year.

Beerman pushing teamto the limit

Intense workouts. Repetitious movements. Strenuous training.

And every drill is practiced until the players reach exhaustion.

Coming off four straight losses, Chris Beerman deﬁed the usual
conforrnities of Pitt’s volleyball team’s practices last week.

“We ran drills that are not nonnally run during the season
because you can wear your team down quickly. That’s something
you do in the preseason,” Beerman said. V

Past Panther practices during the regular season consisted of .

light physical activity utilizing digging, blocking and hitting drills.
The revised practice employs all the same volleyball skill developers
but through a heavy dose of fatiguing workouts.

“We actually had some people throwing up at first,” Beerman
said. “We kept this up the whole week and by the end of the wee
they were asking me for more.” ' ’

The new emphasis in practice -— it’s OK to be aggressive and
emotional. Beennan needs his team toplay with body language that

reﬂects a competitive ﬁre, and through the extreme exercises he.
hopes to ignite the Panthers’ spirits, coaching his team by the belief
“it’s never too late to play well.”

Pitt’s hard practicing paid off last weekend at Fitzgerald Field
House in its matchups against the Syracuse Orangewomen Friday
and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Sunday.

Sophomore April Puzauskas, who was benched earlier in the
season, proved herself in practice last week, earning a starting posi-
tion in the lineup. ~

f‘Ap1il responds to intensity, .and I have a lot of faith in her. It is
just a matter of her realizing just how good she is,” Beennan said.

Puzauskas, who had six kills on 16 attacks and eight digs, said,

' “I like to be pushed. I like to work hard in competition, and in prac-

tice this week we wanted to prove to ourselves that we can do this.”

Beamer not letting losses disrupt team spirit

MICHAEL HAMIDI
Staff Writer

Some unusual themes enter this week-
end’s Big East schedule.

No. 22-ranked Virginia Tech staggers in
to Temple after losing two straight games for

\

the ﬁrst time since 1997, and Miami, .

although undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the

Associated Press poll, is in jeopardy of not

making it to the Rose Bowl because of the
Bowl Championship Series.

. Miami travels to Boston College to take

on William Green and the Eagles, while the

~ Hokies try to get back on track against

. "Temple. Also, Pitt will look for its third

straight win against Rutgers.

Pitt visits Rutgers in a must-win game

The Panthers (3-5 overall, 2-3 Big East)
play at the Rutgers Scarlet Knights (2-6, 0-5)
after a decisive 38-7 win over the -Virginia
Tech Hokies. Head coach Walt Harris’ major
conoem this week is the number of diﬂerent
looks that the Scarlet Knights are going to
throw at the offense.

The Scarlet Knights are coming off of a
lopsided 80-7 loss against West Virginia and
are looking for their ﬁrst conference win.

Although the Panthers got their ﬁrst
conference win two weeks ago against
Temple, a team that beat Rutgers 30-5, it was

the decisive win over the Hokies that has
helped the Panthers chances of reaching the
postseason.

“Our leaders have done a better job
leading. We had a complete game for the
ﬁrst time this season,” Harris said.

Much of the blame for the Panthers’
losses early in the season was attributed by
the media to the spread offense but turnovers
had also been a major factor that hindered
the Panthers. '

“We have to not beat ourselves. We kept
turning the ball over. When adversity hit us,
we didn’t believe,” Harris said.

Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. The game
will not be televised but will be broadcast on

No. 1-ranked Miami takes trip to Boston

College.

The Miami Hurricanes (7-0, 4-0) look
to continue their undefeated season when
they travel to Boston College (6-2, 3-1). It is
the ﬁnal home game of the season for the
Eagles.
“It’s the last home game for the seniors
and we get a chance to win against the No.
1-ranked team in the country,” Eagles head
coach Tom O’Brien said.

The Hurricanes are riding high after a
38-0 Victory against Temple. Although
Temple has only won two games this season,

Miami head coach Larry Coker was proud '

of his team and feels every game is a chal-
lenge.

“It’s a very solid win at Temple. We
were able to run the ball against a very ﬁne
defense. We were challenged,” he said.

, The Eagles are coming off of a bye.
Two weeks ago they beat rival Notre Dame
21-17. ' ' \

No. 22-ranked Virginia Tech looks to get
back on track against Temple .
Two weeks ago, Virginia Tech (6-2, 4-2)

was undefeated, ranked very high and look- A

ing forward to a possible BCS bowl game.
But the last two weeks have been tough on
the Hokies as Syracuse and Pitt dealt them
losses. ,

This week the Hokies travel to Temple
(2-6, 1-4) in search of a victory to end their
two-game skid.‘ The losses were tough on the
team but head coach Frank Beamer dis-
missed any ﬁnger pointing.

“We win as atearn, we lose as ateam,” '

Beamer said. .
The Owls (2-6, 1-4) must try to rebound

from their 38-0 loss to  The Owls ’

have lost six out of their last seven.

,WrstV1rginia battles against red-hot No.

18-ranked Syracuse .

Last week the West Virginia
Mountaineers (3-5, 1-3) beat Rutgers sound-
ly, 80-7. This week is a tougher test when
they visit Syracuse (7-2, 4-0). Syracuse head
coach Paul Pasqualoni said he hopes to
oorne off the bye week strong and alert.

“We need to regain focus and get things

, going.” Pasqualoni said

The Mountaineers will make the trip to
the Carrier Dome, a tough place to play
because it holds 50,000 fans. West Virginia
head coach Rich Rodriguez addressed a
question about the noise factor. ‘

, “I don’t think a lot of people have had
success there. But we’re going to try to pre-
pare for a loud atmosphere,” he said.

Rodriguez was concerned with playing
an away game, but he said that he wasn’t

worried about his team’s elfort or mental

state.
“We showed some emotion and enthu-
siasm against Rutgers and we executed bet-

ter. I hope this gives us conﬁdence for the ,

rest of the season,” Rodriguez said.

THE PITTNEWS

Panthers finally showing consistent execution

Expectations, page 12

With the Boston College game
came the death of the old mental mind-
set and a new train of thought was
forcefully hatched — a newborn vision
and commitment.

The players had no choice. They
could either ﬁght or quit. They had the
choice-of listening to their coaches or
getting them fired.

I was hard on the team in a number
of columns. But there was not one time
that I said that the expectations were too
high. I would never let that be an excuse
for the team because I’ve stated
throughout the entire season that this

team was too talented to be.playing so
_ poorly. '

Notre Dame isn’t 17 points better
than Pitt, and the blowouts in the
Syracuse and Boston College games
just weren’t representative of the prod-
uct that this team was capable of putting
on the ‘field. «

Anyone who said that this team was
not as good as the expectations set for
them was simply lying and allowing the
expectations, things that aren’t. even
real, to serve as scapegoat. '

The simple fact isthat the team was
not prepared before the Boston College
game to play consistently for four quar-
ters. How could 'it have been? The
spread offense was killing the team and
it couldn’t have been aborted any soon-
er.

After the 45-7 drubbing, the seniors
who hadn’t been leading obviously
began to. And the coaches_who weren’t
putting together solid game plans
changed theirways too. .

It was obvious while watching the
Temple game. On a miserable turf, in a
disgusting stadium, with a cold wind
and no ambience, the team united.

The defense swarmed as it had done
during the entire 2000 campaign. It
caused turnovers, abused the quarter-
back and finished tackles.‘

Antonio Bryant caught the opening
touchdown pass, which was preceded
by a long reception by senior R.J.
English. Englishis the IV that has kept
the team moving throughout the season.

3 It was English’s consistency that
kept the offense going with Bryant
injured. And his resiliency could be
pointed to as the catalyst for the tearn’s
ability to_ handle adversity. ’

It. would have been very easy for

English to tuck his head and disappear
after the phantom fumble in Notre
Dame, but rather than hide from the
media that was chomping at_the bit to
smear him, he showed up outside the
locker room and took his lumps. In his
last two games, he caught 12 balls for
more than 200 yards.

Last Saturday, the team that looked
so promising during summer camp

showed up, and with its back against the
wall, kept postseason hopes alive
against a solid Tech squad.

The defense picked up where it left
off against Temple. Shawntae Spencer
darted through receivers’ inside shoul-
ders, running an interception back for a
score. Safety Mark Ponko wrapped up
ball carriers left and right and Brian
Guzek continued to make his presence
felt in the oppositions’ backﬁeld.

The Panthers offense, led by David
Priestley, who had been maligned all
season long for making poor decisions,
racked up 393 yards of total offense.
Priestley threw for three touchdowns

and most importantly, was not inter-
cepted.’
English and Bryant were burning

up the seams, while Lousaka Polite,

Marcus Furman and Raymond Kirkley
did a nice job of carrying the ball. The
team was clicking and taking advantage
of all the talent that it possesses.

Up until this week, I would not pick
Pitt against the spread in my
Compulsive Corner column because I
had not seen the team show that it could
consistently execute and put together a
solid game (did I mention that I am 12-
2 over the last three weeks?).

Pitt has proven that it is over the

hump and that it believes in itself. The
next three games could be a lot of fun to
watch, as good football always is. This
team is now living up to the expecta-
tions that were put forward for it.

Last weekend’s game was not a
shock, a relief or lucky. It was just over-
due. It’s nice to see the program back on
track and I am conﬁdent that this team
is going to make some more noise
before the trek is over.

The Pitt News, and he thinks it's ﬁmny
when coaches say not to underestimate

entire third game, allowing them to record
only 10 digs to Pitt’s 17. Pitt presented
Syracuse with an unachievable game of
catchup, teasing the Orangewomen with
opportunities to take the lead but never
allowing them to go ahead. The Panthers
completed the sweep, winning again by a
score of 30-24.

Beerman attributed their success to effi-
cient defensive pursuit.

“We didn’t give them a chance to get
going. When we were ahead we expanded it,
and if they were down, they would get ahead
and stay ahead — it’s all about defense,”
Beerrnan said.

Game two went back and forth as Pitt
did not give up more than a two—point lead

Pitt answered with its own four-point
streak to pull within two, but it could not
defeat the Irish, who ﬁnished Pitt off wiﬂi
three kills, winning game two 30-24.

Notre Dame took an early ﬁve-point
lead in game three that forced Pitt to take a
timeout. Ullery and Hatlestad kills, a Norris
tip kill and a wide attack by the Irish pulled
the Panthers within one.

But the Panthers could not outplay the

ﬂawless performance by Notre Dame, who 1

recorded only one team error to Pitt’s nine. A
