Party to be Held

Pitt’s Gay and Lesbian
Alliance (GALA) will host a
wine and cheese party on Friday,
Feb. 11 at 6:30 p.m. at the Gay
and Lesbian Community Center
located at 231 Oakland Ave.

Research Done

Doctors at Pitt’s_ medical
school have begun a study of the
use of interferon as a treatment
for recurrent attacks of genital
herpes. \ .

Currently’, the only treatment
for genital herpes is acyclovir,
which lessens the symptoms of a
first attack butdoes not prevent
recurrences.

Dr. Monto Ho, a professor
and chairman of the department
of microbiology in the Graduate
School of Public Health and
chief of the department of infec-
tious disease at the School of
Medicine, said a more effective
treatment is needed. v

“We hope to determine
whether topical applications of
interferon can decrease the sever-
ity and hasten the healing of re-
current_genital herpes,” Ho said.

The ‘studies are open to men
and women 18 and_older have
genital herpes and are funded by
Interferon Sciences Inc..

Business Courses Exceeding Price Range

By ANN O'CONNOR

Undergraduate business majors at
Pitt are beginning to find the rising
cost of education a frustrating real-
ity. The course curriculum of busi-
ness students mandates the
purchasing of new editions of var-
ious textbooks each term.

Steve Smith, a joint business-
psychology major, said that several.
of his business courses require his
buying a new edition of a text, at an
average cost of $26.00, although the
courses are only worth two credits
apiece and the class only meets once
a week. Smith described the expe-
rience as frustrating and felt that
buying one book that P covered
related two-credit courses would be
easier on Pittbusiness students.

Ed Palascak,
undergraduate business, describes

the director of '

Championships, gives a tan a bear hug during, the opening of last week's Great Skate.

the textbook situation as a dilemma.

“On the one hand, Pitt business
faculty obviously do not want to
teach students material which is out
of date,” Palascak said. “As a result,
students are faced with rapidly
changing business texts and high
costs.”

Further, Palascak noted that the
nature of the business field is one of
emerging theories, new applications
of past approaches, technological
breakthroughs and continual devel-
opment of competitive environ-
ments.

“Publishers feel they must keep up

‘with their own competition, so na-

turally they want to update text-
books as soon as possible," he said.
“Financial concerns simply necessi-
tate that the publisher cease to print
old editions, and Pitt is forced to
adopt from the selection of books in

IHC Leadership  
Conference Held

By WES COTTER

The Interhonorary Council held
its sixth annual leadership confer-
ence Saturday in Forbes
Quadrangle.

The program, which approxi-
mately 90 students attended, con-
sisted of learning sessions and
speakers. The conference was open
to all Pitt students, no requirements
were necessary to attend.

The learning sessions were con-
ducted on six different topics: com-
munication and feedback, decision
making and goal setting, assertive-
ness, effective group management,
professionalism and leadership and
implementing an effective program.
The directors of the sessions were six
university faculty members.

The conference was funded by the
Interhonorary Council and the Stu-
dent Government Board through
activities fees. In addition, each stu-
dent paid a fee of four dollars to
cover the costs of the event.

Ms. Mary Ann Frye, a session
leader from the department of social
education, said “self-selection in
terms of leadership is a crucial
aspect of this program.”

The program was well received,
according to John Bellavalee, a
director of the project.

“lt‘s my understanding that the
quality of the program has gone up,
an aura of professionalism has defi-
nitely emerged," Bellavalle said.

Bellavalle added that the IHC
conference is the second largest lead-
ership program on campus behind

Susan Harland, the undergradu-
ate business adviser, said that she
had not received any complaints
from business students. She did
state, however, that even if the
instances of dissatisfied students
were somewhat isolated, the prob-
lem should not be belittled.

Smith also said that he realized, in
comparison to different courses and
majors, the business text turnover
might not be a valid complaint. Yet,
the problem remains that the busi-
ness course curriculum is character-
ized by many overlaps and to date
no attempt has been made to include
the subject matter of two-credit

Encounters
Stalemate

By PAUL CORREA

In the first split of its administra-
tion, the Student Government
Board Friday sent an emergency
request from the Italian Club back
to the Allocations Committee for
reconsideration.

The Italian Club requested $170
to send the president and vice-
president to an exhibition and lec-
tures on Vatican Art Treasures
currently on displayat the Metro-
politan Museum of Art in New York
City.

According to Anna Maria Fato,_

president of the club, $150 is for ‘air-
fare and $20 is for entry fees. The
Allocations Committee had origi-
nally rejected the request, and the
Italian Club appealed it to the
board.

James Shelton, chairman of the
committee, said the request was
rejected because the committee was
unsure how the president and vice-
president would convey what they
learned to the club members.

“I will take pictures, if permitted,
and compile reports about these
treasures to relate to the other club
members upon my return," Fato
said.

classes in fewer books.

Smith cites Business 118 (Man-
agement Science) and Business 120
(Operations Management) as prime
examples of two-credit courses
which encompass much of the same
material yetrequire separate expen-
sive texts.

Palascak admitted that as the
costs of textbooks continue to rise,
Pitt business students would expe-
rience a greater financial burden.
However, the director said that there
is no sense in keeping a textbook if
there is a better one on the market.

Palascak recommended that stu-

. dents keep their old business texts as

reference books for future classes.

In the past, Trees Hall‘ has
been a favorite location for
thieves to burglarize. Countless
numbers of wallets, watches and
other valuables have been stolen
from the locker room and gym-
nasium areas.

However,‘ starting this week,
the rash of thefts occurring in
Trees may lessen—drastically.
Sergeant Charles Grier, of the
Campus Police Community
Relations and Crime Prevention
Unit, has implemented a project
which will deter the number of
thefts. *

A new security locker service
will be offered in which any per-
son affiliated with the university
can store his valuables. The
lockers are located directly
behind the front desk where a
security guard will be stationed.

“The new lockers will hope-
fully eliminate thefts in the build- ‘

ing," Grier said. “All a person
will have to do is sign in and sign
out his key.“ Grier expects the
number of crime incidents to
decrease once the word gets
around that personal valuables
are no longer stored in lockers or
gym bags.

According to Grier, a campus
policeman will patrol the pre-
mises in addition to the security
guard.

“There has always been a
policeman roving around the
building, checking the locker
rooms and gyms," Grier said.
“But now, the bottom line will be
that the policeman will be able to
give a lot more attention to the
lobby area."

Signs will be posted through-
out the building telling people
not to store their valuables in the
lockers. Grier said.

need for this type of thing,” Bella-
valle said.

The program was capped off by
two speakers Dr. Terrence E.
Milani. and the kevnote speaker,
Dr. William B. Neff, the executive
vice-president of American Techni-
cal Institute. Neff"s keynote address
was “Leadership—A Marketable

about practical leadership qualities,

“Leadership is the ability to get
things done through other people,”
Neff said.

JoAnn Wagner, a/junior, said,
‘‘I’m here to learn specific techniques
of organization and also to incorpo-
rate new ideas from other people.”

Cathy Latu, a member of the
Nursing Student Oranizaion (NSO),

said, “It's interesting to interact with
others who also want to sharpen
leadership skills.”

Also in attendance was Kathy
Brown, an SGB member, who said,
“I’m here to learn the proper and
appropriate methods of assertive
behavior as well as professionalsim
and leadership techniques.” Brown
also added -that students can learn a
lot from this type of program if they
make the material relevant to them-
selves and don‘t just let it bounce off.

Fato said she wanted to generate
enough interest among club
members that they would travel to
New York during the summer to see
it for themselves.

After a half an hour discussion,
the vote was split. Four board
members voted in favor of the reso-
lution and four voted against. Presi-
dent Mark Downs abstained and
sent the request back to the Alloca-
tions Committee.

The board postponed another
request by the Progressive Student
Network to hold a program entitled,
“Political Rights and the Law in the
'80s."

According to a PSN representa-
tive, the money would be used to

bring Andrea Low and David Sobel,
representatives from The Campaign
for Political Rights, Ralph McGee-
hee, a former CIA agent and Lewis
Wolf I co-editor of the “Covert
Action Information Bulletin” to
Pitt. The rest of the allocations
would be used for advertisements.

Downs suggested that the board
table the request until Wednesday
when a telephone vote will be taken.

David B. Palko, IHC president
and one of the principal planners of
the conference, said, “People some-
times assume leadership roles and
don't know where to start. This gives
them the opportunity to not only
develop leadership qualities but also
to learn various channenls and
meansto implement an effective
program."

Ron Kinskey, a student,’said, “lt’s
a lot of common sense, and it's good

because even if you've been practic-
ing this, you get insight to theory
and can go back out and apply these
to theory.”

At the conference”were many stu-
dents involved in‘ campus leader-
ship. ‘‘I want to try to be a leader,
some committees are not run well. I
want to learn to be an effective
leader,” said Louise Banks, an RSA
and Pitt International Affairs forum
member.

The following is a list of crimes
that have taken place on campus
in the last few weeks.

Jan. 27: While playing rac-

Some magicians might say the
hand is quicker than the eye, but
according to Peter Samelson, the
eye is quicker than the hand.

Samelson will bring his con-
cept of magic, the Theatre of Illu-
sion, to the David Lawrence
Auditorium on Thursday, Feb‘.
10 at 8 p.m. _ ‘

“Magic is not a subtractive art
form,” Samelson said in a tele-
phone interview. “I don’t get you
to see less about the world, I get

‘ you to see more. I build a reality



in which magic can occur.”

Samelson said he feels the
magic he performs differs from
that performed by other magi-
cians because “most magicians
feel all they need to do is fool
someone when they perform. But
to me, magic is a medium used to
communicate a thought or emo-
tion, not an end in itself.” '

This concept'of magic works
on two levels, according to
Samelson. He cited an example
from the show he will be per-
forming at Pitt to best illustrate
what he does:

“One of the things I do is a
straitjacket escape. On one level,
it's an amazing feat to see, and I
do it as a symbolic tribute to

The Pitt N,cws.,:iMonday February 7,  ' »

Eye Quicker ThanTheHand?

Harry Houdini,” he said. “But on
another level, not all straitjackets
are made of canvas; some are
made of drugs, tobacco or our
own minds. So it's a much deeper
symbol.”

‘‘If people are listening, they
can hear the message I’m trying
to give,” Samelson said. “But
they can also enjoy itstrictly on a
visual level.”

It might be that Samelson’s ’

unusual brand of magic stemmed
from his_ rather unusual educa-
tion. He attended Stanford Uni-
versity as a physics major, but
later switched to theater.
“Physics is a lot like magic in
its technical aspects,” he said.
“The desire to figure things out
has always been with me.”
“Theater helped me in that it
gave me a solid background in
the classics,” he continued. “Tao
of Illusion,” a piece included in
the show, is based on two forms

of Japanese theater.

In 1980, Samelson was the first
magician to go the the Great
Wall of China since the doors
were opened between China and
the West. He enjoyed it so much
he will be going back there in
March.

“When I went to China three
years ago, the only way I could
get in" was with a tour._.I got a

Besides performing on cruise
ships, at magic clubs and at col-
leges and universities around the
country, Samelson also occa-
sionally does an Artist-in-
Residence program at the
universities where he performs.
The program includes psychol-
ogy seminars about perception,
including the way the mind sees
colors and registers objects.

because he depends on audience
participation to assist him and

Where could the Student Government Board

‘ be? Depending on the day of the week, one or
more of these elected representatives might be in .

New Jersey or Texas, at the Airport Holiday Inn
or, on a bad day, here at Pitt.

Last December, memories of campaign prom-
ises to upgrade the public image of the Student

‘ Government Board (SGB) were only beginning

to fade‘. Since that month, however, members of
SGB have attended or planned to attend four
out-of-town conferences, leaving behind many
opportunities to help Pitt students and the SGB’s
image at the same time.

For example, following last term’s student
government elections, The Pitt News and a -
number of Pitt administrators called for changes
in the SGB election code to make campus cam-
paigns less disruptive of other university func-
tions. Student government accepted this
challenge, but it is now February, and no new
election code has been unveiled. Granted, the
rewriting of such an important document should
be undertaken with care, but it should not be
unnecessarily delayed. The time spent by SGB
members travelling around the country is time
lost to a deliberate effort to developibetter elec-
tion rules. ' q

The money spent on these outings is also lost to
other worthy student groups. For example, Pitt's
Italian club was recently denied a small sum of
money ($170) needed to travel to an exhibition of

Vatican art treasures on display in New York.

Since student government budgeting guidelines
give a high priority to educational programs, it is
hard to understand why this request was denied.
Unless, of course, the SGB had already helped
itself to too much of students’ money.
These are just two examples of the many things _

that the SGB could do for Pitt students, if the
SGB would stay at Pitt. The board claims that the

‘conferences it attends will help it to better help

Pitt students. Those beneﬁts may well be out-
weighed by the important work that’s left behind.

Letters To The Editor

Narrow World View

Dear Editor:

Your story about the plight of
Nigerian students at the University
of Pittsburgh is not a surprise. What
is a big astonishment are the state-
ments made by two of the three
interviewees——Timothy Chieke and
Ralph Morrison.

Some statements made by Chieke
are, at best, unfortunate.I challenge

_Chieke to tellus t_he names of those

Nigerians who have left the univer-
sity due to frustration or those two
Nigerians who he accommodated.
Chieke should be ashamed of him-
self for not being aware of the rea-
sons why there has been delay in the
payments of tuititon for the past ‘one
year while Rhea Boudaoud does—
“the problem this year is centered on
the Central Bank of Nigeria which
has delayed in approving the funds

Dear Editor:

I am writing in regard to a short
inset that was placed in The Pitt
News on Wednesday, Feb. 2. The
article was entitled “Students Care
About Animal Rights.” The whole
feeling of this miniscule bit of data
on animal and human protection
and concern is one of ﬂippancy. The
person who wrote this did not sign
his name, and for all practical . pur-
poses, that is to his advantage. I
would gladly have a student organi-
zation invest time in a health and
welfare act as opposed to pledging to
pseudo-brotherly/sisterly bond
clubhouses. '

I have worked serveral years with
animals, and it was a very sad and
depressing thing to see the labora-

...F-for
Animals

Dear Editor:

Thinking people can disagree
about the moral rights of animals.
But when The Pitt News paused to

tory sacriﬁces. Do you think watch-
ing rats guillotined is silly or healthy
dogs returning from experimental
surgery paralyzed and drolling
uncontrollably a joy to behold? This
is just a small amount of the suffer-
ing that exists in our society, and not
in spite of it——but because of it.

The very fact that there are people
trying to help make humanity
human is not deserving of several
paragraphs and a “Ha! Ha! Who
gives a damn” attitude. If there were
more worthy articles in the newslet-
ter concerning positive student
work, it would more than compen-
sate for the loss of quality in the
constant page after page of sports.
So let it be said of athletics “Oh well,
at least students are getting involved
in something.” The next time you
read an article on vivisection or
abuse or look at some poor animal,
think how much a forward pass is
going to save them.

unchallenged—whatever his con- '

ception of the world. To say his con-
ception of the world is very narrow is
to say the least. The Nigerian
government and Nigerian students
at Pitt would like Morrison to come
up with facts to back up his state-
ment. Morrison has a lot of ques-
tions to answer regarding his second
statement that “the problems related
to that government’s delay of pay-
ments to embassy have been going
on for 10 years.” We would like
proof that the situation has been this
bad. ‘ ‘

It is unfortunate to see that an

administrator of Morrison’s caliber .

would make such a blanket condem-
nation of a country which has been
one of the financial sources for the
university since 1963. Nigeria is
grateful to Morrison’s ignorance of

the successful siphoning of millions -

of dollars paid in bulk in- advance
every year by Nigerian-governments
for specially designed programs in
ITOD and education. If Morrison is
so ignorant about all these payments
and Nigeria's financial position in
the world, I feel he needs an orienta-
tion to hold his present position.

notice a student group concerned
aboutthis issue (Wednesday, Feb. 2,
p.3), it did so only to mindlessly dis-
miss the group. Our society’s treat-
ment of animals, however, is not an
issue we can justifiably neglect;
(indeed, reflection on this problem
has led the two of us to become vege-
tarians). Thinking people can—as
we said—disagree about the moral
rights of animals. But the newspap-

The Pitt News, Monday February 7, 1983 D

By JOHN LORD,

What do Andrew Young, George Bush,
John Anderson, Walter Mondale, Lane
Kirkland and Henry Kissinger have in com-
mon with the executives of Exxon Corp.,
Sony, and Time/ Life?

They are among the super-elite cadre of
men and women who make up the member-
ship of the semi-secret, private Trilateral
Commission. Formed in 1973 by David
Rockefeller, the commission’s stated pur-
pose is to foster close cooperation between
the Trilateral regions of the world (the Uni-
ted States, Western Europe and Japan).

According to its constitution, the commis-
sion is organized to “formulate and propose
policies which -the regions and nations
within the regions could follow in their rela-
tions withone another, in their foreign rela-
tions in general, and in the solution of
common domestic problems including par-
ticularly relations and problems ‘involving
(1) economic matters, (2) political and
defense matters, (3) developing countries
and (4) communist countries.”'

A major focus of the commission is to
develop coherent foreign policy recommen-
dations that would advance the common
interests of the Trilateral nations.

To ensure that policies agree with the
commission’s view of world management;
people conducive to this view must occupy
important policy-making positions in the
public and private sectors.

Those sectors include national govern-
ments, international bodies (such as the Uni-
ted Nations), business, academics, the media
and banking. The commission’s philosophy
stresses the need for professional and geo-
graphical diversity in membership—which is
by invitation only.

'..._;i»,}, The commission admits to seeking “men

‘and women of sufficient standing to inﬂu-
ence opinion leaders both public and private
in favor’ of the commission’s recommenda-
tions.” Of the 300 members worldwide, only
10 are women; about 65 members are from
the United~States.

The response to the existence of the com-
mission has varied greatly from those who
believe that members are “hand picked.by
the Trilateral gnomes to deliver a
Rockefeller—dominated world fascist
government" to some observers who are
mildly concerned by “the unsettling thing."

The realistic view probably lies some-
where between these two extremes. But in
any case the paranoia expressed in the
former statement is not without merit. '

Although much of what is written about it
‘indicated an alarmist attitude on the partof

some observers, the commission has, by its
very nature and the views expressed in some
of its publications, helped to foster that »
attitude.

~ F or example, the 1975 Trilateral Commis-
sion publication “The Crisis of Democracy:
Report of the Governability of Democracies
to, the Trilateral Commission" outlines the
reasons for many of our nation's problems:

“Previously passive or unorganized
groups in the population, blacks, Indians,
Chicanos, white ethnic groups, students and
women now embarked on concerted efforts
to establish their claims to opportunities,

positions, rewards and privileges which they
had not considered themselves entitled.”

What America needs, the report argues, is
“a greater degree of moderation in
democracy." '

The report also contends that many prob-
lems faced by “have—not" citizens in the U-
nited States result from an “excess of demo-
cracy.” An excess of democracy?

The purpose of the report was to inform
leaders of trilateral democracies that the
“have—nots” should merely be appeased and
not heeded. The commission's solution to
our problems would be to keep blacks in

Now look at the University of Pitts-
burgh. It is an image-conscious insti-
tution that is striving to attract
students and money during the reces-
sion. Yet, bordering the academic
buildings and dorms is South Oak-
land, a dying neighborhood that can '
claim only the Operatunity Shop as
testament of its renaissance. Doesn’t it
seem to be in the best interests of the
university to help South Oakland
become a clean and viable neighbor-
hood once more?

South Oakland is on the decline
and has been for several years. More
and more homes are being bought by
money-hungry absentee landlords.
More and more trash piles up along
Atwood, Semple, Bouquet and all of
South Oakland. More and more cars
are broken into, and more often than
not, students, particularly women,
must walk the streets in fear of being
held up or raped. A major universtiy
that borders a neighborhood such as

the one South Oakland is becoming

back to the reservation. .
.Perhaps the commission would favor

reserving the electoral franchise to the prop- .

ertied white men—like it was back in the
good ol‘ days.‘

A The commission identifies the primary
“vulnerability of government in the United
States _ (as coming from)...the internal
dynamics of democracy itself in a highly
edlfcatﬁd. mobilized and“"‘participant
society.".A major component of the report's
prescription. calls for a decrease in govern-
ment spending in the social service areas.
Cuts to funding for higher education were
specified. ‘

Given the policies being advanced by the
current administration one cannot help but
wonder how much control the commission
has had over governmental policy. That is a
very scary thought—to have an exclusive,
private organization influencing the policy
decisions of our nations.

Commission members would be quick to
dismiss this concern as that of a paranoid
alarmist. Perhaps, but a degree of healthy
skepticism is necessary to the workings of
our democratic system. A system that many
of us believe could only be improved by
becoming more, not less, democratic.

In any event, close attention must be paid
to any private semi-secret organizations
whose membership is restricted to the prom-
inent and ‘the powerful by those of us who
have nothing less to lose than control of our
government.

Pitt’s Performance Wipes Away Critics’ Smirks

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The chuckles began in many local
precincts soon after Pitt had
announced that it was departing
from the Eastern 8 for the Big East.

From high atop the bluff, where
Duquesne fans ‘might . take more
pleasure in seeing Pitt lose, than in
watching a Dukes’ victory. From

, the Eastern 8 ofﬁce—wherever that

might have been—where Commis-
sioner Leland Byrd was taking Pitt’s
defection more seriously than his
smiling face would indicate. And
even from Pitt fans when they
-thought about the Panthers playing
against the likes of Georgetown, Vil-
lanova and St. Johns. ,

They laugh no more," for the
smirks have been wiped away by
some slaps across the face. The most
recent insult came last Saturday

cut in overtime, 72-71, at the UConn
Field House. '

merous reasons:

Talk to Pitt coach Ray Reilly and
his Panther volleyball squad after
returning from last weekend's Ohio
State Invitational and one might
think he had the world in his hands.

“It was a very productive week-
end,” Reilly said of his team’s
matches against five other squads.
In truth, it may take a little stepping
back to ‘ realistically assess the
situation.

The team raised its record to 8-4-
1, but not before being literally
attacked by an Ohio State team with
fire in its eyes and adrenaline on the
up-and-up. The Buckeyes trounced
Pitt, 15-8, 15-6. After getting a big
surprise at Penn State last weekend,
the Buckeyes were out to avenge the
earlier loss to the Panthers.

“Ohio State is a very awesome
team," Reilly said. “Five of its six
starters are seniors and no one is
under 6-l. They were out for a little

Pitt had similar records playing in

the post season tournament and
advanced to the NCAA’s.

By TODD ERKEL

Pittsburgh—the big little ‘city
with the light brown air and
room in its heart for only one
game—-King Football,—may be
rediscovering the sport of rims,
nets and hardwood ﬂoors. In
case you haven’t heard, the Pitt
Panther basketball team and
their colleagues in the Big East
conference, have brought the
hottest game in the land to the
barracks atop Cardiac Hill.

Pittsburgh sports enthusiasts
who used to spend the month of
February ﬁnishing their game
rooms and watching Julius
Boros’ Ten Ways To Better Golf
areturning out in big numbersat
the Fitzgerald Field House and
nobody . is walking out
unhappy—not after a double
overtime win against Providence
or the one-point coup of Big East
leader St. Johns.

The Panthers continued their
winning, heart-stopping ways
Saturday at Conn. and came
away with their first Big East
road victory, which puts them
within clawing reach of both Syr-
acuse and Boston College in the
conference standing.

All this excitement has begun
to whittle away at the apathy Pitt
students have felt toward
basketball—like city, like school.

0 It showed that freshman Joey
David is no ﬂuke, either. David hit
eight consecutive second half shots,
including a basket off a rebound that
enabled Pitt to take a 52-51 lead with
6:40 remaining. David finished with
16 points and a surprising seven
rebounds. " t  .

‘ 0 Itshowed that. Pitt is not just a
one man team—namely Clyde
Vaughan, who didn't score a field
goal in the first half.

ning 16-foot jump shot with _l1
seconds left in overtime.

Mass. and Storrs, Conn. and
they want in on the action.
“The fans are finally realizing
what the Big East is all about,”
head coach Roy Chipman said.
“It was a gradual building up of
excitement that culminated with,
the games against Providence

' and St. Johns.”

To borrow from Chipman’s
one-step-backwards / two-steps-
forward metaphor, it could be
said that Pitt students will have
to walk a mile before they fit the
shoes of a Big East fan.

Along the way, the fans, the
band, the Panther, the cheerlead-
ers, and everybody’s mentor——
Tiger Paul— will,either learn to
work together or continue to step
on each other‘s toes.

Tiger Paul may have meant
the difference against St. Johns
but he cannot be counted upon
for the rest of this year and years
to come. He has shown the way;
it's time for the student body to
let go of his hand and walk on
their own.

A pattern can be seen in Pitt’s
slow starts on the court and the
fans’ early game restraint. The
near comatose can get excited in
the waning minutes of a double-
overtime game; rabid fans the
likes of which fill the gyms of the
Big East come out seething for
their basketball. The crowds at
the Carrier Dome and The Pales-
tra confront the opposition as
‘they get off the bus and as long as
we're borrowing ideas like count-

,.ing dribbles at the foul line then ‘

why not greet the Orangemen
with an ill~tempered fhello’

.‘__.,.5 ..._. 

“We wanted to get Clyde the ball,"
Pitt coach Roy Chipman said on his
post game show. “He takes shots
that look bad, but if he’s in his range
and things are going right, no one
can stop him.

Right now, no one seems able to _
stop Pitt. The smirks, at least tem-
porarily, have turned to looks of
bewilderment. The grass, which
some say always look greener on the
other side of the fence, is beginning
to look greener and greener. The
Hoopster Rooster, wherever he may
now be, is starting to resemble
Humpty-Dumpty. Pitt is looking

The Panthers play four teams
in the next 12 days all of which
were ranked in the top twenty at
one time this season. Tonight’s
game will be the Big East game of
the week, seen by a-nation-wide
audience, as will be the Feb. 19
game against Georgetown which
will be covered by NBC. In
between, the Panthers will play
Notre Dame at the Civic Arena

very much like it belongs in the Big
East.

Chipman credits the turnabout to
the improved shooting of guards
and the defensive play of Trent
Johnson, who grabbed 16 rebounds
against Connecticut.

One thing is certain: The Big East
hasn‘t improved Chipman’s nerves.
“This league is going to make me an
old man with all these one and two
points games,” he said.

Wrestlers Bomb Bloomsburg; Sunken By Navy

By TIM DINGER

“It guaranteed us a winning sea-
son. That’s the first one I've had
since l’ve been here," WYC-811138
coach Rande Stottlemyer said of
Saturday's win over Bloomsburg
State. '

The Panthers downed Blooms-
burg 26-18 and fell to llth-ranked‘
Navy 27-12.

“We had good overall team per-
formance against Bloomsburg,”
Stottlemyer said. “We also took
some matches away from Navy that
they thought they would win.”

In the first match of the day, Kyle
Nellis of Pitt came back to beat
Bloomsburg’s Todd Cummings 7-6.
Nellis lost to Cummings once before
at the Wilkes Open Tournament,
but this time, a stalling call against
Cummings in the third period gave
the Panther freshman the one point
edge. _

At 126 lbs., Pitt’s- Rich Esswein

Dave Baird, presented a different
picture once OSU had its ﬁll of

“Ohio State was really ﬁred up,”
Baird said.’ “We just got out of the
van and had to play Friday after-
noon. We were a little drained by the
trip and the _Ohio State players were
pretty much rested. Plus our timing
wasn't there most of the time."

The Panther swim team got back
to its winning ways by sweeping a
pair of weekend meets from Cincin-
nati and Marshall. Pitt snapped a
two-meet losing streak Friday night
by defeating the Bearcats, 73-40, at
Trees Pool.

Pitt’s Ed Bahan (50- and 100-yard
freestyle), Ed Bergan (400-yard
medley relay and 200-yard back-
stroke), Jerry Zaleski (400-"yard
medley and 400-yard freestyle
relays) and Mark McCormick (one-
and three-meter diving events) each
had a hand in two victories on the
night.

. After weeks of rehearsal, the cast
of a Hollywood ﬁlm hopes it will
open to a full house and set new
standards for performance in the
profession. Well, after weeks of
practice, the Pitt Lady Panther 880-
yard relay team set a new standard

. for excellence, but, unfortunately,

the house was empty at the Lady
Panther Open Invitational on Fri-
day at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The relay team of Sue Torre, Gail
Counts, Marsha Hawkins and
Renee Henderson set a new school
record in the 880-yard relay with a
time of 1:43.33, which topped the
old record of l:44.9 set in 1979. The
quartet placed second in the mile
relay with a time of 4:06.02.

Also placing for Pitt was Terry
McKee in the 3-mile run with a time
of 18:01.93, whichearned her third
place. Counts finished second in the
50-yard dash with a time of 6.13
seconds, losing by one-tenth of a
second.

In the most exciting race of the
day, Henderson was out-leaned at
the tape in the 300-yard dash by
Lavonne Martin _of the Trotwood

Track’Club. Both were timedat 36.3
seconds.

The day also had its disappoint-
ments for Pitt. After winning her
heat of the 50-yard hurdles, Haw-
kins hit a hurdle and went out of her
lane in the finals and was disquali-
tied.‘ Bothered with .tendonitis, Amy

l_)iFrancesco was unable to turn in

her usual quality performance and

placed fifth in the mile run.

Coach Elbert Kennedy was
pleased with the outcome of the
meet," at which three meet records
and two field house records were
broken.

Martin cut the meet ‘record in the
50-yard hurdles from 6.6 to 6.35
seconds. A new meet and field house
record was set in the long jump by

Juanita Alston of the Falcon Track
Club, who jumped 18-11 3/4, three
inches better than the old mark.

Kelly Austin of West Virginia Uni-‘
versity shattered the meet and field
house record in the 600-yard run
with a clocking of 1228.7.

A total of 15 teams competed in 17
different track and field events in the

my 9...... item ream  schoolm-

invitational on Friday. West Virgi-
ma University was the standout

team of the day as the Lady Moun-
taineers took first place in ﬁve
events. They didn’t, however, domi-
nate the meet, as nine different

teams had winners in Friday’s
competition.

Geary, Kingdom Reign At VMI Relays

‘By CHARLIE O'HARA

“We walked in as a group and left
as a team,” head coach John Vas-
vary said following the Panther
track team’s surprising second place
finish at the Virginia Military Insti-

tute (VMI) Winter Relays Saturday.

The Panthers totalled 84 points,

an amount that, prior to the meet,
was considered enough to win by
Vasvary.
, “Everyone contributed,” Vasvary
said. “We thought that it would take
80 points to win, but we just fell
short of VMI.

“They found out a great deal
about themselves and what being a
team is all about.”

Despite losing to VMI, who fin-
ished with 104 points, the Panthers

« defeated North Carolina State (71),

the Atlantic Coast Conference ’

Champions, South Carolina (43),
Georgia (41) and some 30 other
schools from the South.

The team had a big day with five
victories, but two Panthers were
outstanding.

Sophomore Roger Kingdom set
the meet and field house record (7.0)
during his 55-meter hurdle win, and
senior Darren Gearv set the meet

record (l:53.5) on his way to a first
place finish in the 800-meter run.

They both anchored winning
relay teams. The 220-meter shuttle
hurdle team of Kingdom, Darryl
Shepherd, Joe McCall and Brian
Pollock finished with a time of 29.2,
while the 3,200-meter relay team of
Geary, Garland Brown, Mickey
Rihtarchik and Terry Gallagher
breezed home in 7246.3.

Kingdom was named the meet’s
outstanding performer. For the All-
America Geary, it was another great
showing. , -
