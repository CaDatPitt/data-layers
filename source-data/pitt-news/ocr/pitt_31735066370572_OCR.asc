Board approves honors college,delays divestment

1 David Zafris

News Editor

Pitt's board of trustees voted last
week to create a University Honors
College, a multi-disciplinary school
providing incentives for outstanding
undergraduate scholarship.

The creation of the college was
proposed to the trustees by a commit-
tee comprised of Pitt faculty
members. The new school will be
based on the seven-year-old Univer-
sity Honors Program.

Alec Stewart, the director of UHP,
called the action taken by the trustees
a ”gratifying affirmation of institu-
tion.” Stewart said the Honors Col-
lege will not be a separate or free
standing college; it will be closely
linked with the other programs at Pitt.

”The first thing we'll be doing is to
talk to deans of some of the colleges
and discuss the details of the degree

PittburghWPublic”Schard Pesien(cter) le Milliones took part in

structure," he said.

President Wesley Posvar said the
new college will enhance Pitt's
reputation as an institution that holds
undergraduate academic attainment
as a basic objective.

”We expect the Honors College to
expand our students’ academic and
career horizons,” he said. ”This new
endeavor will not only help us attract
the highest caliber’ undergraduates,
but also enable us to retain scholar-
ly and very talented faculty.”

The Honors ‘College will not
replace UHP; it will expand on it. It
is anticipated that a large number of
undergraduates will still participate in
UHP coursework without seeking ad-
mission to the Honors College. About
700 Pitt undergraduates now par-
ticipate in UHP.

Admission to the Honors College
will be based on merit following at
least two terms of coursework, and

upon the recommendation of the col-~

lege’s advisory board. The college
will offer a special joint baccalaureate
degree indicating successful comple-
tion in both the student's original col-
lege and the Honor 5 College.

The trustees also addressed a

resolution from the Student Govern- _

ment Board, calling for complete
university divestment from all com-
panies doing business in South
Africa. A

The proposal was presented by
state house speaker and Pitt board
member K. Leroy lrvis, who said Pitt
has a reputation for not caring about
blacks. .

About eight percent of Pitt's
undergraduate students are black, a
figure roughly equal to the percen-
tage of black college students
nationwide.

Trustee Chairman Robert Kirby said
that a vote to divest could not be

Pitt Athletic Director Edward Bozik
has been appointed interim senior
vice president to replace current Vice
President Jack Freeman, who is leav-
ing Pitt to take the position of
chancellor at the University of Maine.
Bozik will remain vice president un-
til a permanent replacement can be
found. Dean Billick, the athletic
department's associate director, will
temporarily fill Bozik’s position.

A search committee is now being

formed, and Robert Flint, assistant to

the president, said he expects the

committee, to be compiled sometime

this week. He gave no indications as
to when the search for a permanent
replacement will be completed.

Bozik said he does not see any ma-
jor difficulties in taking over
Freeman's position.

’’It’s going to be difficult under any
circumstances to replace Jack
Freeman, who's a very capable and
highly respected university ad-
ministrator," he said. ”Though in
many ways it's not a new position for
me."

Bozik served in a similar role
before being named as athletic direc-
tor in 1982. In 1975 he joined Pitt as
an assistant to the chancellor, after
being an air force planner. The next
year he was named.executive assis-

Bozik replaces Freeman as V.P.

tant to the chancellor, and two years
later he assumed the position of assis-
tant chancellor.

Bozik said he will work closely
with Freeman over the next few
weeks to acquaint himself with
specific details of current campus
issues.

Bozik said he has worked closely
with Billick, and he does not foresee
any problems with him assuming the
responsibilities of athletic director.
Billick also said he and Bozik have
worked well together.

”|'ve been working as Ed's right
hand person, and he has been good
about keeping me involved in what's
going on in the athletic department,”
Biliick said.

taken immediately, however,
because a public notice ofthe resolu-
tion has not been given.

The resolution was forwarded to
the investment committee and the ex-
ecutive committee for review. They
will then submit a report to the board
on divestment. The report is expected
to be finished in two months.

Pitt currently has an estimated $19
million invested in companies doing
business in South Africa. Since 1978,
Pitt has followed a policy of selective
divestment from companies not

adhering to the ”Sullivan Principles,” ‘

a set of rules governing fair treatment
of both white and black workers. Pitt
also refuses to invest in companies
that do not make good progress in
working for blacks’ welfare in South
Africa.

Barbara Sizemore, head of Pitt's
black studies department, said at the
meeting the trustees ”regard for the

lives of black South Africans is not
nearly as important as friendship of
corporations.”

After the meeting she said the I
trustees are just avoiding the issue. L

”This board of trustees has no in-
tention to make an effort to divest,”
Sizemore said. ”The bad thing about
this whole meeting is that it's now a
racial issue. All the blacks on the
board are for divestment and all the
whites are against it.”

”Now the only way the board can
be convinced to divest is civil dis-
obedience, picketing or causing a
problem and demonstrating
wherever they go,” she said.

Posvar said at the meeting that Pitt's
decision to divest would have little
effect on South Africa. He said
pressure should be put on the U.S.
government to impose sanctions
against the South African
government.

Apartheid protesters
visit Posvar’s home

<

Greg R. Beshero

For The Pitt News

”Posvar, Posvar, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide.” That was

the chant of about 50 people Saturday in front of Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s

house in Shadyside. Students For a Free South Africa and Pittsburghers Against
Apartheid held a protest after the board of trustees decided to send a Stu-
dent Government Board divestment resolution to a committee for further
study. “P

”We’re here because of the trustees’ stand on the issue of divestment,”
said SFSA member Doug Howell. ”The trustees decided to snub a motion
by K. Leroy lrvis, state speaker of the house and trustee member.”

The trustees held their annual meeting last Thursday in Greensburg. lrvis
made a motion for the trustees to totally divest all university funds from com-
panies that do business with South Africa. He said his motion was seconded
by Mary Jane Paige, the only other black trustee. But trustee Chairman Roger
Kirby said he did not hear the second and moved to send the measure to
an investment committee for further study. Neither Kirby nor Posvar could
be reached for comment.

Jake Milliones, a leader of PAA, said Kirby ”snubbed lrvis in the nose”
by his action at the meeting. Milliones alleged that the trustees broke
parliamentary procedure by not voting on the divestment issue. But Kirby
said the resolution was not on the agenda for the meeting and that public
notice of the vote had not been given, so the vote could not be taken.

”We’re also upset that the issue at Pitt is being divided along racial lines."
said Milliones. ”We think it's high time the trustees decided to back up their
words that they are against apartheid with actions.”

Milliones said the trustees at Pitt have beenstonewalling on total divest-
ment and are tired of all the delays. ’

”We think it’s unfortunate that the University of Pittsburgh trustees have
not backed up their words with actions,” Milliones said. ”We’re sick of hear-
ing that they're against apartheid. We want something done about the op-
pression that is taking place there and that something is divestiture of all
university funds from companies that do business with South Africa.”

Since 1978, Pitt has followed a policy of selective divestment. Pitt divests
from companies doing business in South Africa that do not adhere to the
"Sullivan Principles,” a list of rules calling for equal treatment of both white
and black workers. The university also divests from companies not making
good progress in following the principles. Last year Pitt divested over $15
million from companies not making good progress under the Sullivan Prin-
ciples, according to the board's investment committee. .

SFSA member Doug Howell said that the university would not be losing
any money from divestiture; in fact, the amount that would be divested is
fairly small. ”Finances is no longer an issue,” he said, ”and the trustees no
longer have any excuses not to divest.”

Saturday's demonstration was the first at Posvar’s home by the two groups,
but it will not be the last, according to leaders of the demonstration.‘

”We’ll be here every Saturday until Posvar decides to do something about
apartheid.” said Howell. C

Milliones said the two groups plan to picket at other trustees’ homes, such
as Roger Kirby's and State Representative Fischer's. ”We’re going to take
this fight to the streets,” said Milliones.

The leaders of the demonstration said they are confident their efforts will
help speed Pitt along in the divestment process.

Eight dead in floods; federal aid sought *3

PITTSBURGH — Governor Dick
Thornburg appealed to President
Reagan for federal funds Monday in
the wake of killer floods that ravished
areas north and south of Pittsburgh.
Eight people were killed when flash
flooding hit Friday, two others are still
missing and feared dead. According
to Thornburg, if President Reagan
declares the affected communities
disaster areas, victims of the storms
would be able to apply for low-
interest loans, grants and public
assistance funds. Thornburg already
has declared 10 communities state
disaster areas, so National Guards-
men could help in the cleanup. The
request
U.S. Senator Arlen Specter toured the
area with Allegheny County Commis-
sioners Tom Foerster, Pete Flaherty
and Barbara Hafer. Cleanup officials
said preliminary estimates of the
damage run as high as $20 million.

Senate hits television

the Senate's most historic event since
1795, when 50 observers were
allowed to watch the Congress in
Philadelphia. Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole was happy with the
televising too, as he called it ”a big,
big plus.” The television coverage
was provided by C-SPAN, which had
already televised House proceedings.
Monday's proceedings reached near-
ly 25 million American households.

WASHINGTON, D.C. —- Monday,

sion,_ and Senate Minority Leader
Robert Byrd predicted the televised
sessions are here to stay. Byrd also
told reporters that the televising was

Sunday, 155,000 workers struck
AT&T. Company officials said that it
is in pretty good shape after the first
business day of the strike. A
spokesman for the company said that
automation and direct dialing kept 90
percent of long-distance calls unaf-
fected. Management employees _have
been called in to take the place of
striking workers, and many will be
working 12-hour days, six days a
week. According to a union represen-
tative, picket lines are growing at
company facilities across the coun-
try. The striking workers belong to the
Communications Workers of
America, which held an emergency

meeting Monday to discuss strategy.
Talks between management and the
union broke down over the weekend
over job security and wages. A union
spokesman said that many of the
workers are especially unhappy with
a company plan to end cost-of-living
adjustments. Union President Morton
Bahr said that the company is de-
manding unwarranted concessions,
and since management recently
received big raises, it is unfair to ask

V the workers for concessions. No new

talks between the two sides have
been scheduled.

Gromyko attacks
Reagan ”blunder”

LONDON —— In a meeting with
Deputy British Prime Minister
William Whitelaw, Soviet President
Andrei Gromyko attacked President
Reagan's decision to abandon the
terms of the unratified SALT II treaty.
Gromyko said the move is ”a major
American blunder” and could jeopar-
dize chances for a superpower sum-
mit later this year. After the meeting,
Whitelaw said that Gromyko wants
the British government to use its in-

 

fluence to persuade President Reagan
to change his mind. Reagan insists
that he renounced SALT II in order
to tie future decisions on U.S. nuclear
forces to Soviet actions. Reagan has
promised that the United States will
not exceed Soviet levels of bombers,
missiles and warheads and, therefore,
abandoning the treaty will not lead
to ”an unbridled arms race.”

Six nuns die
in Dublin fire

DUBLIN, Ireland — Fire officials
said they have not yet determined the
cause of an early morning fire Mon-
day atone of Ireland's most exclusive
girls’ schools. The fire claimed the
lives of six elderly nuns. According
to authorities, fire swept through the
Loretto Convent in St. Stephen's
Green as the nuns were sleeping. But
in the process of trying to escape, the
stairs collapsed and six nuns fell to
their doom. Fifteen nuns were
rescued by firefighters but, according
to a police officer, the firemen could
not rescue the other six because of
intense heat and flames.

Fireball lights up
Miami skies

MIAMI -— A strange fireball
streaked across Florida skies Sunday
night from the Keys to the Panhan-
dle, prompting hundreds of calls to
police departments and the Kennedy
Space Center. One Miami policeman
said that many of the callers thought
they had seen a UFO. But
astronomers at the Miami Space
Planetarium said that it was no such
thing. According to the astronomers,
the fireball was caused by space junk
— a spent rocket from a manned
Soviet space flight crashing back to
earth's atmosphere. Space center of-
ficials said that no one was in any
danger, as the rocket burned up im-
mediately when it entered the
atmosphere.

F|JIs combat drugs and alcohol

Cindy Fish

For The Pitt News

Pitt’s FIJI fraternity is undergoing
two new projects designed to
educate both high school and
elementary school students about the
ill-effects of drunk driving and drug
abuse.

Brenda Todd has been chosen to
appear as ”Huggy the Bear,” the of-
ficial symbol of the new Brothers
Against Drunk Driving program
”Hugs not Drugs.” After being one
of the top I3 finalists in the Pirate Par-
rot auditions, Brenda was sought after
by J.J. Tippman, head of the B.A.D.D.
campaign.

As Huggy the Bear, Brenda will
enter the elementary schools as an at-
tention getter for the children, a figure
of reinforcement. The Huggy the Bear
mascot is derived from a phrase
which is the main. message of
B.A.D.D. — being educated, aware
and responsible.

The second program in the
developing stages for B.A.D.D. is a
series of presentations on alcohol and
drug abuse for high school students.
The members of B.A.D.D. think they
can successfully relay their message
since they are relatively of the same
age group as the students. There is
still much organizing to do, but
members said they hope to get this
program together for students by
September.

On Monday in the ballroom of the
William Pitt Union, members of
B.A.D.D. held a press conference to
introduce their new programs.

Peggy Stewart, a local educator and
counselor of highschool and elemen-
tary students, spoke about the impor-
tance of a child's self-esteem. She
said that kids who do drugs do not
like themselves very much. She also
said children need better com-
munication withtheir families and
peers.

”Most families in America are in
trouble today because they don't
know how to say, ‘I care about you,’’’

she said. ”And when kids can’t han-
dle their lives and they can't say how
they feel, they'll take a drug to numb
it [the painJ.”

Last year B.A.D.D. launched the
start of their program with a non-
alcoholic tailgate party before a Pitts-
burgh Steeler game. They also con-
ducted a ”Don’t Drink and Drive”
seminar for all the Greek organiza-
tions at Pitt.

Aside from these events, FIJI has
contacted other chapters of their na-
tional fraternity on the campuses of
Penn State University, Washington
and Jefferson College and Allegheny
College.

B.A.D.D.’s headquarters will be
located at the William Pitt Union,
and every Pitt fraternity will have an
opportunity to join the organization.

To help promote its campaign,
B.A.D.D. is seeking both financial
and promotional help. The organiza-
tion is seeking assistance from con-
cerned citizens, businesses and
organizations in the Pittsburgh and
surrounding areas.

Pitt administers
Malmberg funding

John Zaphyr

Staff Writer

Carl Paul Malmberg graduated
from Edgewood Senior High and
then received a B.S. in molecular
chemistry at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. He joined the Peace Corps in
I980 where he served at St.
Stephen's High School in Molhale’s
Hoek, Lesotho.

In February of 1984, Malmberg
was struck and killed by a hit-and-run
driver while riding his bicycle. He
was 26 years old.

“We want to continue Car|’s goal
of sharing knowledge by sharing his
estate, and we hope that the
establishment of the Carl Paul
Malmberg Scholarships will inspire
similar actions by others who are able
to do so,” said MaImberg’s father.

Malmberg’s parents, Paul and
Geraldine, were able to deal with
their grief best by deciding that they
did not want to profit from their son's
death. They discussed the situation

with his two brothers and two sisters

and decided to set up a trust fund.

An additional $5,000 was con-
tributed by Carl's friends and the Carl
Paul Malmberg Memorial Scholar-
ships were established.

The first scholarship will be ad-
ministered by Pitt. Under Pitt’s coor-
dination, one qualified student each
year, beginning in 1987, from any
school in Lesotho will receive a
scholarship to continue graduate
studies at Pitt.

"The students will be picked by a
committee of administrators and pro-
fessors from the university and by
members of the Malmberg family,”
said Jonathon Flint of the president's
office.

The second scholarship, ad-
ministered by the Domestic and
Foreign Missionary Society of the
Protestant Episcopal Church in the
United States, will contribute a year-
ly amount toward the education of
the students at St. Stephen's. Both
scholarships will continue indefinite-
ly, as long as all parties are satisfied.

Protection

City controversy — an ever-present aspect of ur-
ban life. There is always something new about which
one can read, discuss or complain. A volatile topic
currently under public scrutiny is the issue of health
clinics for high school students. A task force from the
Pittsburgh School District is investigating the possibili-
ty of health clinics to distribute information about sex-
ual matters to the city's youth. These clinics would
provide literature such as ”Know your own Body”
and ”What to do ifl get Venereal Disease.” Not on-
ly would these clinics provide needed information,
but they would give personal counseling, medical ex-
ams and dispense birth control.

The installation of such clinics infuriates many
parents. They complain that health clinics promote
sexual promiscuity and undermine the moral stabili-
ty of their children. However, it is this same group
of parents who will blame the school district for
neglecting to instruct their Johnny or Mary about sex-
ual matters when something happens to him or her.

Traditionally it has been the parents’ responsibili-
ty to educate their children about sexual matters. Far
too many are embarrassed to discuss the topic with
their sons and daughters. Lacking knowledge, Johnny
and Mary experiment, often unaware of the
consequences.

This is a serious matter. Unwanted pregnancy and
sexual disease plague this city's youth. The task force
is doing what it thinks will alleviate a serious prob-

lem. After all, the school district and its teachers have
the responsibility to educate. If the parents aren't do-
ing their job, then the school district must supplement
it. Furthermore, if the parents are truly upset, they
should band together and offer an alternative —
perhaps an information center of their own.

Yes, a district clinic as proposed would seem to en-
courage sexual activity. But what is better — ig-
norance and pain, or knowledge and peace of mind?

What a pleasure it was to watch
William Jacobson and James Kelly
destroy the silly arguments of
Students for a free South Africa. This
is not a letter to support apartheid.
[Apartheid] is an obnoxious system
which degrades humanity. But as the
two representatives pointed out to the
audience, the end of the apartheid
system will come from the South
Africans themselves, and it is stupid
to think that we have a great deal of
leverage over the situation.

SFSA [members] proved the old
adage that if you yell loud enough,

 
 

no matter how outrageous your ac-
cusations, someone will believe that
your facts are correct. When they
tried that formula on the two
gentlemen from the State Depart-
ment, it just wouldn't wash. When
they tried their outrageous invest-
ment numbers, Mr. Kelly showed that
U.S. investment in South Africa was
less than 2 percent and dropping.
When after a five-minute propagan-
da speech a question was finally ask-
ed about computer sales, Mr. Kelly
showed that computer sales to South
Africa were for humanitarian pur-
poses only and could only be approv-
ed by himself and the president. How
nice it is to hear from people with the

Letters to the Editor-—'———'=

Of course, how important can
SFSA be? In a campus of thousands
of students, they can barely get a hun-
dred people at their last rally. By fall,
this group will fall apart as the knee-
jerk liberals move on to their next
cause.

The administration of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has done a great job
in their investment policy. Aside from
only investing in? companies that
follow the Sullivan principles, they
also maintain several watchdog
groups to make sure their trust -isn't
being violated. I only hope that the
administration can maintain their
course and not be bullied by a group
that is small, obnoxious and
unrepresentative.

CLEAR SKIES FOR FOLK FEST

If you weren't at the 10th Annual
Smokey City Folk Fest, you missed
out on a real good time. Several thou-
sand of us came from all over to en-
iov some talented performers play
like there was no tomorrow. We
were treated to a great variety of
American folk and ethnic music and
dancing. Hammered dulcimers filled
the air with their unique sounds.
Stompers just plain stomped up a
storm, and they had no easy task.
With the 80-degree temperature and
sun beating down on them, they
sweated in their heavy costumes.
Dancing like that is about as demand-
ing as ballet or karate, and I couldn't
help but admire them.

That fest had something for
everyone. Yes, everyone. I couldn't
figure out if one singer just happened
to sound like Joan Baez or if she were
imitating her, but she was good. Her
voice was hauntingly beautiful.

As I enjoyed the atmosphere and
the company of some friends, I ab-
sorbed the scene so as to piece
something together to describe the

smoke with a festival

fest. I was suprised to learn that the
fest was sponsored by a local group
called Calliopi House. I was always
under the impression that the city's
Department of Parks and Recreation
ran it, like their popular summer film
and concert programs (which start in
two weeks). I should then have said
job well done to both parties, as I'm
sure everyone there had a great time.
You couldn't help but have a great
time.

The weather was near perfect. Im-
agine a thousand or so people relax-
ing to folk music on Flagstaff Hill,
with several hundred others mingling
on the sides. There were barbecues
and crafts up and down the hill, as
well as stands from a few local
groups. I wandered around sampling
some damn good sausage and ribs,
just checking out what people were
upto. It would have been nice if they
had a beer truck there -— I ran out of
beer three times during the day.

When you're drinking beer in the
hot sunshine, it's always a good idea
to play lots of Frisbee and then sweat

out most of the beer. You lose weight
and get good exercise. To a casual
observer, you look like you know
what you're doing, and it's a great
way to even out your tan. The winds
at Flagstaff are perfect for throwing
Frisbee, and a throw using the winds
put the disc in the hands of my part-
ners without them having to move an
inch —— a Frisbee thrower’s goal.

The hill was also a girl-watcher’s
delight that day. I've rarely seen so
many lovely women there. I focused
on one lass who was sunning topless.
Trust me, you couldn't help but
notice her, even from 40 meters
away. My luck, she was an old friend
of mine. A swell person to be with
when she wasn't driving me crazy.
I still have affection for her, but all
she's left me are memories.

That fest is a memory now, a pleas-
ant one for many people. My
memory of last night is vague, like
how I got to Shadyside to eat a steak
the size of a Lhasa Apso. Maybe it
was a Lhasa‘-ﬁpso. If anyone is miss-
ing one? 

Why not get involved with something worthwhile?

Listen to Dr.

A few weeks back, USA Today
conducted a nationwide survey on
issues concerning college students. It
was quite revealing. It seems that
we're an affluent, conservative and
goal—oriented crowd. These qualities
are noble, on the surface. What this
spells out is something we already
know — we are selfish, and like it.
An example of this notion is that col-
lege students are extreme liberals
when it comes to the actions of their
peers. But when it comes to what
they do, with whom they associate
and how they present themselves,
there is a strong move to the right.

So, whatever you do is OK, but I
must watch out for myself. This is an
interesting attitude, especially in the
area of college sexuality. The USA

Ruth

Today findings that really caught my
eye were those about college sexual
habits and attitudes. Men don't care
(too much) if the woman they marry
is a virgin. Women are still caught in
the age—|ong paradox that they’re
slime if they do and prudes if they
don't. Both men and women fear
AIDS. Both men and women fear sex-
ually transmitted disease. And they
are concerned (just concerned) about
unwanted pregnancy. After all, it's
very hip to be a single parent in the
'80s.

College has traditionally been the
arena for sexual experimentation.
And we're a responsible bunch,
right? Well, another finding from the
USA Today survey was that the ma-

jority of students polled feel that birth
control should be a mutual concern
of both men and women. So what's
the problem? It seems that the student
population is quite aware of the
proper means of birth control.
However, they often fail to use any
form of birth control. I mean, it just
wouldn't be love. Now let's step back
and take a look at this situation. First
of all, in college sex, there rarely is
any form of love, save love of the mo-
ment. Secondly, once these
hedonistic delights are experienced,
their possible ramifications are brush-
ed aside.

You see, we as a group are no bet-
ter than the teens gaining sexual
knowledge through trial and error.

The only advantage we have over
them is that we're better informed.
We know what can happen to the
careless. We all know someone who
is a mommy or a daddy a few years
before they had planned to be. But
being informed is useless if the
knowledge is ignored.

We had a visitor here at Pitt last
year. She was probably the most
practical speaker we've ever had. Dr.
Ruth came to Pitt and spread the
word on good sex. She gave no moral
judgement, as would most religions
(especially mine). She merely gave
facts about a world most college
students explore, some with a map,
others without even a compass. Her
objective was to inform us that sex

Sex and the single teenager

The idea of implementing student
health centers in city schools seems
to have stirred up quite a bit of con-
troversy. As with any time the issue
of contraception is raised, two
vehemently opposing factions
prepare for battle: the pro-lifers, who
refer to these centers as ”abortion
clinics in disguise;” and the pro-
choicers, who claim to be protecting
the reproductive rights of young peo-
ple. There are faults with both
arguments, but given the cir-
cumstances, I’ll stand with the pro-
choicers on this one.

It was eloquently stated by some-
one on the opposing side that you

Simple access to assorted creams,

answer. This access must be paired
with a strong program of education
and counseling. A program that
reaches teens before they're teens

can be wonderful. But to be so, there
must be responsibility before, during
and after.

So take a few minutes out of your
passion and think. Think about your
partner. About children. About
disease. Jim and Tammy Baker didn't
ask me to write this. I don’t think
they'd agree with my stand. In fact,
looking over this piece, I guess it does
advocate sexual ventures. It also ad-
vocates common sense, maturity and
responsibility for one’s actions. Listen
to Dr. Ruth, sexual activity can be
wonderful. Sexuality, however, is not
just two grinding bodies on Flagstaff
Hill. The decision to be sexually ac-
tive is an important one. Quite literal-
ly, lives hang in the balance of said
decision.

beyond the mere mechanics of safe
sexual activity. It's got to drive home
the point that being sexually active
doesn't necessarily make one a bet-
ter person and that sexual activity car-
ries some heavy responsibilities.
Responsibilities that I5‘/2—year—olds
are just not emotionally equipped to
handle — kids need to hear that it's
OK to say no.

Maybe, just maybe, the implemen-
tation of this program will convince
parents to hang up their sexual
neuroses and talk to their kids. A new
sexual education program will only
be effective if the lessons learned in
school originate and are reinforced
in the home.

The Bard returns to Pittsburgh

Kathy Stahl

News Editor

t's back. Pittsburgh’s
Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival is here and
ready for a new season
of comedy and drama.
Once again the Steel City will
become a cultural center worthy

. of its top billing.

”The festival has more than just
an impact on the arts,” said Attilio
Favorini, producing director and
chairman of Pitt's theatre arts
department. ”It has an impact on
the whole city. We want to
reverse the image of Pittsburgh.
We are doing Shakespeare where
nobody else is doing it."

Favorini came to Pittsburgh I7

years ago from the Big Apple

itself. Although he desperately

I wanted a job in New York,

Favorini settled for one here and
within a year or two he saw the
opportunity to do a lot with the
theatre department at Pitt.

It was Favorini who founded the
TRSF in 1980. "The festival has
grown since then from a semi-
professional community theater to
the fourth largest nationally,” said
Favorini.

”This year we've put together
the finest company. We've
brought back some of the favorite
actors and actresses from the past,
and we have some of the best
from here,” he said. "They work
together well; there's an ensemble
feeling."

In this years festival, A Midsum-
mer Night's Dream, All's Well
That Ends Well and King Lear will
be performed in the above order.
The director of each play is
responsible for ultimately creating
a show that will serve to entertain
the audience.

Steve Coleman, the head of
Pitt'sMFA acting program, is the
director of Dreams, which opens
tonight. Coleman has both acted
and directed during his six years
with the festival. .

”I like both acting and directing,
but for different reasons,” said
Coleman. "Acting is a very per-
sonal, subjective experience.

, Directing is also very challenging.

You have to get inside the
playwright’s mind and then make
your own interpretations.”

Coleman said that he thinks
Shakespeare is five times harder
than anything else. ”It makes
more demands on the actor and
director,” he said, ”but it is also
the most exciting to do.”

One of the hardest things to do
in Dreams, according to Coleman,
was dealing with the transforma-

tions of the play world. The play,
viewed by critics as one of’
Shekespeare's best comedies, has
often perplexed directors and set
designers because it requires that
the audience's perception of the
characters change throughout the
play.

The play centers on the confu-
sion that occurs as a result of
love, both requited and unre-
quited. The type of love also af-
fects how the characters react to
one another. To add confusion to
the farce, there are two separate
worlds, the real world and the
magical fairy world.

The play begins in the fairyland
with Oberon and Titania, fairy
king and queen, fighting over who
will possess a "Changeling" child.

It is this fighting which causes

disruption in Athens where
Theseus, the Duke, is preparing to
marry Hippolyta, the queen of ‘the
Amazons. Also, there are four
young Athenians involved in a
love struggle. We meet Lysander
and Hermia, who are madly in
love. They are detained from their
love by Demetrius, who also loves
Hermia. To make matters worse,
Hermia’s friend Helena loves
Demetrius and is jealous of Her-
mia. Hermia and Lysander plan an
escape from Athens. At the same
time, a group of local workmen
are preparing a play to honor
Theseus and Hippolyta in their
marriage. This play within a play
adds to the hilarity of the entire
production.

''I'm not necessarily
trying to put on the best
show I can. I'm here to
teach the students to act
and direct — they're pay-
ing my salary. I'm a
teacher before I'm
anything else.

—— Steve Coleman

Head of MFA acting
program

Back in the fairyland Oberon's
follower Puck has used a magic
love potion on a sleeping Titania,
which will make her fall in love
with the first creature she sees
when she awakens. This sets off a
string of events that will effect
everyone in the play.

The play continually goes back
and forth between the real world
of the Athenians and the magical

world of the fairies. Add this to
the confusion among the various
lovers. Combine this all with the
fact that most of the actors have
double roles. Imagine the job that
Coleman has putting it all
together. »

”Finding the right series of
choices to make was hard,” said
Coleman. "You try to arrive at a
conceptual point of view that il-
luminates the play in a new and
different light. I tried to
emphasize the element of percep-
tion."

One of the ways Coleman did
this was through a stage setting
which contains only a large, cir-
cular drape hanging from the ceil-
ing to the floor. The actors raise
or lower the drape depending on
the changes in scenes and
perceptions.

Another important aspect of
directing is getting a group of ac-
tors who work compatibly and
creatively. "These are people who
live on their emotions,” said Col-
eman. "They are not your average
workers. Casting is very important.
After you've cast someone it's
hard to replace them.

"The cast now is a very com-
patible, talented company," he
said. ”I've watched them grow
from individuals to a successful
working company.”

Casting appears to come easy to
Coleman, as he has put together
many successful plays. Although
Coleman has a smaller group to
choose from and work with when
he directs Pitt productions, he said
that it is no problem.

'’I’m not necessarily trying to
put on the best show I can," said
Coleman. ’’I'm here to teach the
students to act and direct. They're
paying my salary. I'm a teacher
before I'm anything else.”

Pitt's theatre department has
many talented individuals. Victoria

' Herd, a graduate student studying

for her MFA degree, is an exam-
ple. This year is Victoria's third
year in the festival.

Herd said that she has always
wanted to be an actress, even as a
child. She did her undergraduate
work at Penn State but then came
to Pitt because they made her the
best offer. Herd feels that one of
the most important things she has
learned at Pitt is to enjoy being on
stage.

”You really do have to learn to
like being up there,” Herd said.
"You have to learn to be confi-
dent and to quit worrying about
making mistakes. When you can
do this a whole new world opens
up to you.

”You get to work in a com-

pany,” she said, "and the people
are all friendly, we get along well.
You're with the people eight
hours a day, six days a week, so
it's nice to get along."

The fact that she's acting in one
of Shakespeare's plays also ap-
peals to Herd. ”Doing
Shakespeare is very challenging,''

she said. ’’I mean, it's all in verse,

and verse that rhymes yet."

In the festival Herd has the parts
of Helena in A Midsummer
Night's Dream and Diana in All's
tWeII That Ends Well. Although
she plans on moving to New York
City when she graduates, Herd

said that she would return to the . .

festival next year if the opportuni-
ty arose.

A couple of other Pitt students
are also contemplating the move
to New York. They are Rick
Ewing, who is completing his
MFA in directing, and Mary-Io
Kelly, who is pursuing her MFA in
acting. This is Ewing's fourth
season with the festival, while Kel-

. ly is making her debut.

These talented individuals met
while doing their undergraduate
work at Allentown College. They
got married andcame to Pitts-
burgh to finish their degrees.

Ewing said that the idea of the
festival was something that in-
trigued him when he decided to
come to Pitt to do his graduate
work. Kelly "was also interested in
the festival and said that she is
nervous about making her debut.

’’It's scary because nobody has
seen what I can do," she said,
"but I've been watching them and
I've seen how good they are."

Ewing and Kelly have a three-
year-old daughter named Dara
who is making her acting debut in

Dreams. She plays the part of the
"Changeling child." Kelly said that
the first day Dara was on stage
she ran off screaming. "Now she's
not afraid," said Kelly, "and the
biggest problem is getting her to
behave/'

Dara said that she would like to
continue her acting career. She
seems to enjoy herself on stage. ''I
like dancing, and singing and
sleeping," said Dara. These are all
things that she does in the play.

Also in the festival is Tim
Meyers, who is the complete op-
posite of Dara in terms of ex-
perience. Meyers is a professional
actor who has appeared in many
productions at avariety of
regional theaters.

Meyers is now returning to the
University of Pittsburgh and study-
ing in the MFA program. He said
that he returned to school because
he felt it was time to look into
something more stable that would
allow him the opportunity to live
somewhere, instead of traveling
around all the time.

Meyers is glad to be in the
festival this year. "Doing
Shakespeare is more demanding in
many ways than other kinds of
roles," said Meyers. ”|t's
frustrating because the language is
very difficult. No one knows what
you're talking about. It's a
challenge to make it understand-
able."

Making Shakespeare understand-
able to people is what the festival
is all about. ”People from all
walks of life can be enriched by
Shakespeare if it's presented in a
down-to-earth manner," said
Favorini. ”People need to under-
stand that they do not need a
Ph.D. to enjoy Shakespeare.”

This years festival runs until
August I7. There will be special
sign-language interpretations on
June 15, July 13 and August 10.
There will also be three evening
performances which will take
place on Flagstaff Hill in Schenley
Park on‘August 21,22 and 23.

Gabriel triumphs by writing from the heart

Stephen Morrison
Staff Writer

Tragically, there are few makers of
modern music who can be accurately
described as ”artists.” But there are
indeed a few, as Peter Gabriel’s work
happily reminds us. The expectant
anxiety over the release of his newest
album owes, more than for any other
reason, to the fact that he has taken
nearly four years to make it. It was
thus inevitable that the record in its
actuality, no matter what it sounded
like, would please some, outrage
others, and confuse and bewilder
many. With So , however, only his
fifth studio album since he launched
his solo career over a decade ago,
Peter Gabriel has come full circle.”
The wild experimentation is over.
The ponderous epics of obscure
literary references and social
metaphors have been quietly absorb-
ed and filed. The anger, still present,
has been given a context and now
plays an important but supporting
role. In short, Gabriel has fully
matured as an artist. Far from a
defeated bid for commercial ascen-
dance, 50 is a masterful display of
everything Peter Gabriel has learned
about record—making.

The top priority of the album seems

to be that there is something to please i

everyone. In this, So succeeds ad-
mirably. There are eight conscious-

ly diverse songs, rangingfrom the _

”traditional” Gabriel piece ”We Do
What We're Told,” an unsettling ex-
ploration of the moral implications of
the Milgram experiments (consult
your Intro. to Psychology textbook),
to the surprising Motown slam of
”Sledgehammer,” the album's single.

This can be seen as a liability.
While all of the songs stand on their
own merits, they do not form a
sonically consistent whole. The on-
ly common denominator is the com-
plex, multi—layered production of
Gabriel and co-producer Daniel
Lanois. On the other hand, the
stylistic inconsistencies are
forgiveable in light of the fact that

The Smiths: Big Mouth Strikes Again

The Smiths are back in Poptown
with their new poptone ”Big Mouth
Strikes Again.” Like all of the Smiths’
classics, ”Big Mouth” is infested with
infectious peaks of energy and excite-
ment. Morissey yodels feverishly, and
Marr unleashes an ascending guitar
crescendo. Morrissey’s emotions

Gabriel handles all of the different
styles with uniform facility. Even ”Big
Time,” an all—out funk number,
succeeds.

So triumphs most clearly on the
songs where Gabriel lays aside his
conceptual ambitions and writes
from his heart. Here may be found
some of the warmest, most satisfying
songs he has recorded. ”Don’t Give
Up,” an uplifting gospel piece featur-
ing Kate Bush in a guest vocal slot,
which provides soothing counter-
point to Gabriel’s impassioned ser-
mon. ’’In Your Eyes,” a likely can-
didate for a single, boasts artfully
understated production. The basic
chords, for example, seem to be a
blend of piano with a soft Fairlight
setting, and a rich army of
background vocalists. The song
builds slowly, moving from the quiet
verses into a stirring chorus wherein
Gabriel declares, In your eyes/I see
the doorway to a thousand chur-
ches/The resolution of all the fruitless
searches. It is, for me, the musical
equivalent of an ‘e. e. cummings
poem: an assertion of human feeling
over intellectual concerns, a rejection
of wisdom in favor of the simple
mysteries of love. ’’In Your Eyes”
may be the best song Gabriel has
ever written.

Other songs have less definable
charms. ”Mercy Street,” dedicated to
poet Anne Sexton, is ghostly and hyp-
notic, a tantalizing story of reality,
dreams, spirituality, and the blurring
of the borders between them. “Red
Rain” is ambiguous but compelling,
driving home a single visual image
that has decidedly unpleasant con-
notations. Throughout all the songs
are trademark Gabriel touches, from
his classic Fairlight flute
(”Sledgehammer”), to the monotone
chants that represent group
psychology (”We Do What We're
Told”), to the amazing drum sound
that pervades the album.

Many of Gabriel’s fans will no
doubt be alienated by this record.

These are the people who are
nostalgic for the overblown, preten-

tious ramblings of his work with
Genesis. The same people who can-
not comprehend that Gabriel’s solo
work belongs to the present, and that
it is utterly contemporary and vastly
superior to anything that he record-
ed with his former band. Others, who
have more pretense of being ”with
it,” will say that he has sold out, not
understanding that accessibility has
always been of prime importance to
Gabriel.

By the same token, it’s ironic that
the album’s two weakest songs,
”Sledgehammer” and ”Big Time,”
are the songs most obviously tailored
for airplay. It would be refreshing to
see the album's best songs (take your
pick) become hits. That‘ was not
possible with 1982's Security, where
the best songs were entirely unsuited
to radio. Almost , anything on So

This is the Smiths at their absolute

band were to split up, as rumors float
about the mirky pool of wasted
cosmic slime, for there is not a bet-
ter pop band in the world today.

counters with the '60s (1984's All
Over The Place), in a more folky

could conceivably be a single, a rarity
for a Gabriel record. ’’In Your Eyes,”
at least, deserves to be a hit.

So is not Peter Gabriel’s best
record. Nothing he has recorded
since has matched the sheer terror of
his third self-titled album (from 1980),
which presented a stark and hideous
portrait of modern society, and which
remains one of the best rock records
ever made. Nor has he again hit the
heights of conceptual brilliance that
he achieved on Security. ln a sense,
he has mellowed a bit. In the final
analysis, though, So is a fine album,
worthy of its predecessors, revealing
a musician who has found a comfort-
able niche with the very best of to-
day’srecording artist. So is a record
to be listened to carefully and
thoughtfully, and then listened to
again.

vein, have resulted in nothing more-
than-gutless girl gutter pop (a weak
cup of tea, ya know). Good ideas
were present, but all was lost in the
frighteningly shallow songwriting.

With the likes of Jules Shear and
Prince scribbling out notes for the
girls, the Bangles have added a little
sugar to their cream and things are
finally starting to fall together it
seems.

Belinda Carlisle: Mad About You

Belinda Carlisle is such a knockout
that both of the jurors would lend
their ears even if she released a
12-minute version of ”Smoke on the
Water.” ”Mad About You” is a soar-

ing summer car radio confection with
just enough sugar to make it tasty, but
not enough to rot your teeth. The
former Go-Go should pack her bags,
because she's bound for Hitsville
with this one.

Emerson, Lake and Powell: Touch
and Go

Those purveyors of rock excess,
Keith Emerson and Greg Lake, have
acquired the services of former Rain-
bow drummer Cozy Powell. This
track is less ostentatious than past ELP
efforts, but when Greg Lake opens his
mouth, ”Touch” sounds like it took
first place at the international Cliche
Festival.

Lou, don't settle for walkin’

John McCombe

Entertainment Editor

Mistrial appears to be an attempt
by Lou Reed to continue the process
of ”growing up in public.” What is
most striking about this work, as with
the four other albums that the ”god-
father of punk” has released in the
'80s, is the incredible adequacy of
the performances. For me, ”ade-
quate” is a painful description for a
man who once led New York City’s
breathtaking and ground breaking
Velvet Underground.

With the Velvet Underground,
Reed's laconic vocals always meshed

seamlessly with his subject matter.
The band's heroin-induced ramblings
of sexual perversity were accom-
panied by Reed’s cotton—mouthed
mumbles which suggested that the
singer had visited the sleazy and
chaotic terrain of the Velvets’ unique
vision. With age, Reed's material has
lost much of its bitter distaste. Now
his vocals seem completely out of
sync with his newfound compassion.

A perfect example is the album
closing ”Tell it to Your Heart,” a
delicate ballad which requires ample
vocal sensitivity. Because of his
awkward phrasing, Reed is unable to
effect the emotional transition that the

J.P. Presley
For the Pitt News

There is a disgusting number of
new music critics who genuflect at
the mere mention of Curt Kirkwood’s
name. Well, the insane idolatry of
that Arizona dustbrain ends here.
Kirkwood’s group, The Meat Pup-
pets, performed two shows last
Thursday at Graffiti and proved why,
live, the band should soon rival
Sominex in the sleep-aid market.

Problem number one is the band's
utter lack of diversity and color in
their sound. Nearly all of the Puppets’
original material,iincluding songs

2 from their new EP Out  Way ran‘

together as one big smudge of slop-
pylsound that rarely strayed from the
band's choice of two tempos (a plod-
ding shuffle and an accelerated
crawl). On record, Kirkwood has
shown that he is quite adept as a
guitar technician, but on stage he
could easily have been wearing a cat-
cher’s mitt. The sheer volume of the

amplifiers made it impossible to sam-
ple the deft, lyrical guitar touches that
abound on the group's 1985 LP Up
on the Sun. A

Only when the Puppets delivered
some choice cover versions did the
dance floor fill and a large portion of
the audience awake from their com-
atose state. ”The Race Is On,” ”| Just
Wanna Make Love To You” and
”Good Golly Miss Molly” supplied
tunefulness and intensity, a combina-
tion that was too often absent from
the show.

in regard to their place among the
bands with the greatest influence
upon college radio, The Meat Pup-
pets proved that they lack both the
sonic powerof Husker Du and the
knack for creating the dreamy,
pastoral landscapes of R.E.M.
However unique The Meat Puppets’
musical flavor may be on vinyl, this
band of desert dwellers left another
impression with their stage show. At
Graffiti, The Meat Puppets tasted like
a cactus sandwich.

equally quirky David Byrne made on
the revelatory ”This Must be the
Place” (from Talking Heads’ Speak-

listener remained unmoved.

Elsewhere on Mistrial, Reed at-
tempts to offer incisive social com-

in the process. Both ”The Original

This guy is not Henry Rollins

Since 1978, a singer by the name
of GG Allin has carved his
pornographic-anarchistic mind onto
five LPs, eight EPs and numerous
cassettes, and has toured Canada,
Germany, Sweden and the United
States, usually opening for infamous
bands such as GBH or the /DK’s.
What has possessed this man to play
so many gigs? The answer is his paltry
$100 guarantee. Of course there is
a catch. GG is the rudest, dirtiest,
anti—social stage personality ever. He
has had a perfect record of being
banned wherever he had played. An
example of his madness is his latest
release Boozing and Pranks, a live
recording of his previous American
tour — the one that got him arrested
in three states and banned for
obscenity, disorderly conduct,‘ drugs,
defecation on stage and rape. After
one particular gig, GG ended up in
the hospital with self-inflicted blood
poisoning and a stab wound from a
female bystander whom he had at-
tempted to rape."

Beyond the fact GG is one of the

sickest, most horrifying problems fac-
ing society today, his musical attribu-
tion is a true expansion of alternative
horizons. GG has a knack for produc-
ing quality rock ’n’ roll mixed in with
his disgusting lyrics and a slight
distortion —— possibly due to the fact
that he records with a cassette player,
not in a studio. When asked if what
he does is punk, GG stated, ’’I am the
only hardcore. What other punk
bands do can't compare to me. I can
make anyone throw up anytime,
anywhere!” After this quote 1 know
a few may be skeptical, possibly
believing that GG is another Henry
Rollins, (the singer of Black Flag who
is all talk). But GG’s half—hour video

shows the singer jumping off a gar-

bage dumpster onto a tar surface
coated with broken glass. To receive
his latest live release Boozing and

Theater is alive and well and living in Pittsburgh

by David Zuchowski
Staff Writer

There is an abundance of theater
this summer in the Pittsburgh area.
From Cranberry Township to
Washington, from Delmont to Moon
Township, thespians are taking to the
stage to perform an array of dramas,
musicals and comedies. What
follows is a partial listing of some of
the available theater with an attempt
to rate the performances. Each play
is given from 0 to 5 stars, with 5 stars
being best.

Forbidden Pittsburgh

This sparkling musical review takes
a swipe at America's most liveable ci-
ty. Everyone from the mayor to Bill
and Patty Burns feels the heat in such
ditties as ”Patrice and Jon,”
”Clint/Dick Blues” and ”Seen.” You
don't have to be a Pittsburgher to en-
joy the show, but it helps.

/acques Brel is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris

A caberet—style tribute to the music
and poetry of Jacques Brel, this
musical review has proved to be so
popular and successful that its run at
Harper's has been extended in-
definitely. Under the musical direc-
tion of Pittsburgh's own Joe Negri,
the review includes the famous and

’ haunting ”Carousel” and ”lfWe On-

ly Have Love.” Recalling the Parisian
Bohemia of the '50s and '60s, Brel
captures the spirit and style of the
Belgian-born poet in an emotional
rainbow that deals with everything
from love and loneliness to pity,
death and joy.

With a superbly selected cast,

best efforts in the last two years.
Robert Moberly as the showoff,
Aubrey Piper, eclipses his past per-
formances in Real Things and Private

formidable Mrs. Fisher almost steals
the laurels away from Moberly. The

Uproar In The House
Complicated plot full of deceiving
and deceived characters unfolds over
the course of more than two hours
to reveal a series of humorous and
comedic episodes. This British farce,
basic, well—written and highly enter-

taining, could use a bit of editing. The '

large 13-member cast of colorful
characters does a commendable job,
but their affected English accents
sometimes only hint at authenticity.
Well worth the drive to rural Del-
mont, the pl-ay is staged in an old
rustic barn surrounded by apple trees.
A dinner option is available at the
nearby Lamplighter restaurant.

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik

Eric Poole

For The Pitt News)

Dr. Edward Bozik accepted the
position of athletic director at the
University of Pittsburgh in 1982.
Since then, Bozik has seen the Pitt
football team fall from perennial top
20 status to 3-7-1 and 5-5-1 seasons
in 1984 and 1985, respectively.-
However, during Bozik's tenure as
AD, the basketball team has emerged
as a contender for national honors,
while the wrestling and men's and
women's swimming teams have re-
established themselves as the best in
the East. Especially impressive has
been the performance of individual
members of the men's track team -
Roger Kingdom, the 1984 Olympic

Gold Medalist in the 1 10-meter high
hurdles, and Lee McRae, the world
record holder in the 60-meter dash.

Next week, Bozik will temporarily
step down from the position of AD
in order to become the interim
replacement for Dr. Jack Freeman,
the outgoing executive vice presi-
dent. (See story, page 1.)

Q: You are about to temporarily
replace Dr. Jack Freeman as ex-
ecutive vice president. Do you feel
that this will hurt the athletic program
in any way? -

A: No, I have an eminently capable
associate [athletic] director in Dean
Billick, who is experienced in the
duties of the athletic department. He
and I actively share the leadership
role [in the athletic department], and
he will be reporting to me in this

capacity, so we will be seeing each
other a lot. ,

Q: You have had a busy year with
hiring coaches. About Coach Fazio,
at what point last season did you
decide that he wasn't going to be
around in 1986? -

A: The obvious answer would be
when we announced it. I don't think
that you can review the decision and
tell why it was made.  We just sat
down and decided that it was impor-
tant for us to make a change.

Q: A lot of people out there agreed
with you.

A: It was not an easy decision
because I have the greatest respect for
Coach Fazio, not only as a coach, but
more importantly, as an individual.

Q: He is currently defensive assis-
tant at Notre Dame.

A: Defensive coordinator, a posi-
tion he held here for a number of
years.

Q: Paul Evans, the new basketball
coach, was forced to deal with a lot
of recruiting difficulties at the Naval
Academy, yet still recruited a lot of
good players. Do you think that this
is cause for optimism‘ that Pitt's
basketball recruiting fortunes will
continue to improve?

A:‘| have every reason to believe
that Coach Evans will be a successful
recruiter, given his very successful
record at the Naval Academy. There

- are many recruiting problems for a
-I-‘ti?

coach at a service academy, not the
least of which is that an athlete at a
service academy has to serve five
years in the service upon graduation.
 On the other hand, there are also
some benefits. They [service
academies] have a national base; they
are national institutions. And the ap-
plicant pool, while perhaps limited
in athletic skills, tend to make up for
it academically and intellectually.
Q: Do you ever find occasion to in-

terfere with the day-to-day runnings
of the athletic teams?

A: If you mean, do I tell the
coaches how to coach, the answer is
no. I am not qualified or equipped to
do that, and even if I were, I would
have no intention of doing that. You
hire a coach to coach. I work with the
coaches mostly on policy decisions,
such as academics. They are the
managers of this program and the
managers that I have working for me
I expect to deal with policy issues. If
I ever gotthe temptation to pick up
the field phone and tell the coach to
throw a pass instead of an end run,
I would be totally unqualified.

Q: What are your immediate goals
for the Pitt athletic program?

A: To step back and evaluate the
football program. The won-lost
record has been a big disappointment
the last couple of years. I am op-
timistic that this will change this fall.
We have some good athletes return-
ing and some good recruits coming
in. It is also important to remember
that there are other sports here also.

to a new athletic era

The men's track team is among the
best in the country. We are trying to
improve within the limits of the
university, and we hope to solidify
our financial base and developour
annual giving and fund raising so that
we can continue to increase the
number of scholarships in varsity
[non-revenue] sports.

Q: What goals do you hope to
reach during the rest of your tenure
in this_office?

A: I would like to see Pitt become
among the leaders in the country in
percentage of athletes graduated. I

would also like to have a more solid , A

financial base. But I think that this
may be attributable to the local
economy. This department can't
count on the $5,000, $10,000,
$50,000 donations, so we end up go-

_ing for the $10, $20, $1000 dona-

tions. This means that we have to
work a lot harder. I would like to see
continued improvement in the varsity
sports. Basically these objectives
were all stated in my position when
I first took this office.‘

NBA to reap Big East bonanza in 1986 draft

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

The National Basketball Associa-
tion's annual collegiate draft is right
around the corner, June 17, and it
should be one of the more interesting
drafts of recent years.

This year's draft is stockpiled with
many quality players, albeit none
whom are bonafide superstars, a la
Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and so
forth.

Although no Pitt players will be
drafted (Sorry, Darryl and Keith),
many Big East stars will be selected.

Walter Berry, St. John's multi-
talented power forward, and Dwayne
”Pearl" Washington, Syracuse's
dynamic point guard, are two
guaranteed first round picks.

Of course, Berry and Washington
each skipped their last year of col-
legiate eligibility to enter the draft.

Also, Washington's teammate at
Syracuse, small forward Rafael Ad-
dison, and Villanova's
Pressley could both go in the first
round. .

The following is my critical evalua-
tion of the Big East's top prospects
and a prediction for what round each
player will be selected in.

Harold 2

WALTER BERRY — St. John's
power forward, 6'8". Many Big East
coaches breathed a sigh of relief
when the "Truth" went hardship, but
the person who is really going to lose
out on this decision is Berry himself.
There is no doubt he will be an NBA
success, but he will not be the star
many peoplejbelieve. He needs to
work on his outside shot and learn
that there are four other players on
the court wearing the same uniform.
Still, Berry is an exceptional talent.
FIRST ROUND.

DWAYNE WASHINGTON —
Syracuse, point guard, 6'2". I was
never a big "Pearl" fan myself. He
_has all the tools to be a great one, but
can he deliver night in and night out
in the pros? I don't think so. Some say

he was bored with zone defenses in -

college. Believe me, no one is that
good. Although, even I would love
to see him on the Knicks with Patrick
Ewing. FIRST ROUND.

HAROLD PRESSLEY — Villanova,
small forward, 6'7”. Everyone agrees
that Berry was the best player in the
league last season, and he was, but
this guy had the best all-around year
in the Big East. Pressley can do it all.
He needs to work on his outside shot,
but I think he has risen to the elite

~ ofthe draft class. FIRST ROUND.

RAFAEL ADDISON —— Syracuse,
small forward, 6'7". Addison was a
big disappointment this past season.
Still, he is a tremendous shooter.
He'll be forced to put the ball on the
floor in the NBA and that is where
he hurts. It's not that he can't drib-
ble, but I don't think he has any
moves to the hoop. SECOND
ROUND.

DAVID WINGATE — George-
town, second guard, 6'5”. Wingate
could be the Big East's sleeper in the
draft. I wouldn't be surprised if he
goes late in the opening round.

Wingate has a devastating first step,
plays good "D," and just has great
athletic talent. SECOND ROUND.

WENDELL ALEXIS -— Syracuse,
power forward, 6'9". He improved
markedly every year with the
Orange. Alexis needs to hit the
weights, but he is a solid a||—around
player with a nice shooting touch.
Guys with his kind of talent aren't
available for too long on draft day.
Alexis is no exception. SECOND
ROUND.

MICHAEL JACKSON — George-
town, point guard, 6'2". Simply put,
Jackson peaked too soon. He was at
the top of his game after his sopho-

more campaign. Jackson's talents are’

obvious (good shooter, excellent in
the transition game), but the reasons
for his decline are not. THIRD
ROUND. ..

EARL KELLEY — Connecticut,
point guard, 6'1 ". Kelley's story is a
sad one. His off the court problems
with the police and his academic in-
eligibility midway through last year's
Big East schedule diminished his
chances of making the NBA. He is a
great shooter and a fine passer also.
But his chances are slim. FOURTH
ROUND.

DOMINIC PRESSLEY — Boston
College, second guard, 6'3". There
is no place in the NBA for Pressley,
but he is such a tremendous athlete
I think he will be drafted early. Last
season he was the fastest player in the
country baseline to baseline. On the
other side of the coin, his lack of size
and shooting ability will do him in.
FOURTH ROUND.

RON ROWAN — St. John's, sec-
ond guard, 6'5". Rowan can do one
thing well and only one — shoot the
basketball. Guys who can do nothing
but shoot don't make it in this league.
His lack of quickness is especially
evident. FIFTH ROUND.

ANDRE MCCLOUD — Seton Hall,
second guard, 6'6". McCIoud seems
to be stuck between positions. He is

too slow to play off-guard and not big
enough to occupy the small forward
spot. He reminds me a lot of former
Panther star Clyde Vaughan (great
scorer with minimal vital skills: pass-
ing, handling the ball, defense).
McCloud’s chances are also very
slim. SEVENTH ROUND.

ROGER MCCREADY — Boston?

College, power forward, 6'5-".
McCready was a tremendous over-
achiever for the Eagles. You don't see
many 6'5" power forwards anymore.
McCready's problems are obvious,

he is another Vaughan protege. He ’

would be forced to play off-guard in
the pros and he simply doesn't have
the skills. SEVENTH ROUND.

So there it is, my fearless predic-
tions for the Big East stars in the up-
coming draft. Granted, calling Berry
and Washington first round picks is
about as hard as calling the Celtics
the NBA's best team, but the other
picks are a bit more inconspicuous.

What really matters for the Big East
fan is not what happens in this year's
draft, but what occurs in the league
next season. R .

Everybody knows that the depar-
tures of Berry and Washington will
have a tremendous impact on the
league standings and the individual
awards department.

Morrison leads Pirate climb from cellar

Jim Morrison knocked in seven runs in Sunday's game
with the Dodgers.

Our $499 stereo system  

The Pirates find themselves in a
battle for fifth place in the National
League East as June arrives. The Bucs
were in the cellar when the Los
Angeles Dodgers came to town for a
series last weekend. After dropping
an extra inning affair last Friday, the
Pirates downed the Dodgers Saturday
and Sunday.

Pirate third baseman Jim Morrison
had a season’s worth of statistics in
Sunday’s 12-3 win. Morrison had five
hits, including a triple and a grand
slam home run while knocking in
seven of the Pirates dozen runs. For
the time being at least, Morrison
seems to have a lock on the starting
third base position, but Bill Almon,
a utility infielder, has been excellent
when given the chance to play. Third

‘base, such a question mark in spring
training, appears to be a bit of a pleas-
ant dilemma for manager Jim

ticket outlets.

In other baseball news this week,
the divisional races are taking shape,
and a number of surprises are to be
found all around the league. The big-
gest shocker is in the National League
West where three also-rans of a year
ago — the Giants, the Braves and the
Astros — are waging a battle to find
out the best in the West. Amazing
what a new manager and a rookie or
two can do for a team.

in the American League, the
defending World Champion Royals
are in a nip and tuck battle with
perhaps 1986's most authentic
Cinderella, the Texas Rangers.
Although at this relatively young
stage of the season, maybe it would
be better to refer to the Rangers as
mere debutantes. The dance of Oc-

The Pitt News, June 4, 1986-

tober playoffs is still a far away dream
and pitching gone sour, that scourge
of September, has kept countless
teams looking in from the outside at
what was supposed to be their
playoffs.

Whether it be the Royals or
Rangers, the ‘team they meet in the
AL Championship Series is likely to
be the favorite. And that favorite is
shaping up to be either the Red Sox
(who lead the division thanks to
brilliant pitching and thunderous hit-
ting), the second place Yankees (in
the race because of-Ricky Hender-
son's bravura at the plate and supris-
ingly good pitching) or the Orioles
(who just keep winning). Nobody
knows how the Birds are winning,
but it probably has something to do
with Earl Weaver.

does not sound like
an appliance!!!

Today, there are a lot of places
selling stereo sound including
department, appliance, mass mer-

A chandising, and catalog stores.

Most of these stores have two
things incommon. First, they do not
sell expensive state of the art com-
ponents so they rarely get to hear
the world's finest sounds. Second,
the nice people they employ, who
also sell refrigerators, lawn mowers,
and coffeee pots, are not the ones
from whom to get the correct ad-
vice about stereo. Their good inten-
tions are not a substitute for real
knowledge about sound.

Opus One is the dealer for the
best sounding equipment in the
world. Our staff knows what is im-
portant for great sound and what is

not. We carefully test and listen to
all of the low cost equipment to find
the few that sound real, like the ex-
pensive great units. "

Not only is Opus One. Penn-
sylvania's oldest (founded in 4959)
stereo store, but our staff has work-
ed very hard to gain great know-
ledge about sound. Our people
have installed more stereo systems,
repaired more components, and
recorded more live concerts than
all other Pittsburgh audio stores put
together!

Our 8499 system has been
carefully engineered with a Sonus
Brown magnetic cartridge, a Dual
4258 automatic turntable, a Nikko

will protect your valuable recordings

similarly priced chrome plated, “look-

Part II:
Playing
straight

By Eric Poole

For The Pitt News

Editor's note: This is the last ofa two-
part series on steroids and their evils.

A few weeks ago, while the Pitts-
burgh Steeler minicamp was taking
place, I was at an Oakland dining
establishment when two Steeler free-
agents walked in. Since both men
were interior linemen, I decided to
pop the question.

"Do you take steroids?” I was not
as shocked by the answer as I was by

the casual way in which he gave the

answer:

”Yeah, I eat them for breakfast
every morning.”

”Better football through chemistry”
seems to be the slogan of almost
every professional football player
who plays in the interior line, where
the big boys reside. Steroid usage is
seen as a necessity in a world where
millions of dollars change hands on
the basis of one man being stronger
than another man.

It was revealed in the first part of
this story last week that the use of
steroids is not confined to football
players. Actually, track and field
athletes, weightlifters and body
builders are all known for their heavy
use of the drug.

As a matter of fact, the use of
steroids (predictably) is , so
widespread in those latter two sports
that nearly every weightlifter or body
builder, even the clean ones, have to
put up with accusations of being on
them.

”It’s like getting an ’A’ on a test,
and then having someone tell you
that you wouldn't have gotten that ‘A’
if youih'adn’t cheated,” said one local
body builder who asked that his
name not be revealed because/‘I
don’t want to see my name on the
same line with (the word) ’steroids.”’

He also added that a clean com-
petitor cannot compete on equal
footing with a steroid user. ”No mat-
ter how much natural ability you
have, someone else is going to have
the same ability, but they will have
the added assistance [of steroids]/’

This body builder, who is a security
guard at a local restaurant, is extreme-
ly proud of his body, because ’’I
didn't cheat to get this body  I didn’t
put anything unnatural into my body
 I didn't pop any pills or take any
injections." He feels that the reason
that that most muscular men are
labeled as steroid users is jealousy.
”Some people who don’t have
natural ability workout for three
years, and nothing happens. Another
guy who has the natural ability works
out for three months, and gets results.
The first guy thinks ‘he's [the second
guy] got to be on steroids.”’

This week the NCAA’s Southwest
Athletic Conference announced the
adoption of a random drug testing
policy for a number of performance-
enhancing drugs on the NCAA’s
banned drug list, including steroids.
The local body builder feels that
steroid testing should extend to all
sports at all levels. ”[Anyone who
tests positive for steroids] should be
kicked out of the game. That way, no
one starts off with an unfair advan-
tage.”

Taking care of the latter, I see
Georgetown’s Reggie Williams as the
consensus pick for the league's pre-
season Player of the Year.

Also, I expect Rony Seikaly
(Syracuse), Mark Jackson and Willie
Class (St. John's), and Pitt's Charles
Smith to join Williams on the
coaches pre-season All-Big East team.

As for the Big East race, it will be
a wide open contest between five
teams.

loses everybody g but Seikaly,
although, let's not forget the great
recruiting year the Orange had.
Georgetown loses four starters, but
don’t feel sorry for John Thompson.
Georgetown has Reggie and some
great young players who will comple-
ment him. Villanova was a surprise
this year, but wait until next season.
The Wildcats will be even better.

Finally, I come to the talented, but

often maligned, Pitt Panthers. If the

the year to do it. The Panthers have
talent. The problem is coaching,
discipline and a few other in-
tangibles. Hopefully, Paul Evans can
turn it around. If he does, watch out,
Pitt could be the league's premier
team. You say you don’t believe me?
Well, I'm not the only one who likes
Pitt's chances. One noteworthy hoop
magazine, Eastern Basketball, already
has the Panthers penciled in as the

nation's I 1th best team for the

1986-87 season. Starting next winter,

Strange wonderings   as vacation ends

Well, well, well, sports fans. Here
we are at the beginning of June and
The Sporting Life is finally back from

vacation. The Sporting Life staff and ‘

I had a swell time, we're all very
rested. Especially after watching
World Cup soccer this past weekend.

Outdoor soccer is even more bor-
ing than the NBA’s regular season.
And that's going pretty far consider-
ing the NBA before the merry month
of May is about as exciting and useful
as a garden hose with four holes in
it. No use to nobody. I admit that in
the finals the action and my interest
in the game do pick up, but why six
months worth of ball to have one de-
cent week of excitement.

The National Hockey League is
another league which treats its fans
and teams to a month of playoffs. The
NHL playoffs are not so much as to
determine the best team in hockey,
but to find out who is hot during April
and May. In the abscence of a dynas-

. ty, such as we have in the NHL right

now, the Stanley Cup is anybody’s
prize. A great _team like the Cana-
diens of the 19705 or the Islanders of
the early I 980s will stop an
overachiever, but when there are no
great teams a mediocre one can wind
up as the the Stanley Cup champions.

Don't believe me? On their way to

winning four consecutive Cups be-
tween T980 and 1983 the Islanders
beat in the finals such sad sacks as
the Vancouver Canucks and the Min-
nesota North Stars. Lousy teams who
played well in the playoffs.

One more thing —— if the Canadiens
and Flyers were to play a seven-game
series beginning tonight who would
you take? So would I, the Flyers easy.

But enough of this playoff
nastiness. Spring is in the air, which
means only one thing: girls in bikinis!
OK, so it means two things. The other

almost mystical about the union of
car and driver performing as one,
during the race they truly must be as
one. It may be the most perfect com-
bination of man with machine we
ever shall see.

Now we move on to important
items. The NCAA Lacrosse champ-
ionships were held at Newark, De|.,
last weekend. The University of
North Carolina is the new champion.
They beat Virginia in the champion-
ship game. The Tar Heels came from
behind to knock off defending cham-

Bob Travers

being the Indianapolis 500. I love that
race! The only thing I know about
cars is that they need gasoline to
move. I don't know why that is, I
don't want to know why, but
somebody once told me that and it
seems to be true. Despite my ig-
norance I am enthralled by the Indy
500. I like the way the cars sound as
they whip around turns at speed ap-
proaching 200 mph, and I love the
way the cars look. There is something

 

     
 
 

is§.1..V..S0N#1  

 

pion Johns Hopkins. The other semi-
finalist was Syracuse. This bit of in-
formation is only for those of you
without ESPN. We lucky enough to
see the all sports cable channel had
about eight chances to watch the
lacrosse final last weekend and will
have 47 more chances in the next
four days. Next week, all you non-
ESPNers, I'll give you the latest
roundup from the Australian Football
League.

The money here said the Pirates are
building the nucleus of a team
capable of contending for the divi-
sion championship every year, much
the way the Bucs of the 1970s did.
Just a reminder the Pirates were CllVI-
sion champs in 1970, World Champ-
ions in I971, division champs in
1972, I974, 1975, World Champs in
1979 and in I973, I976, T977 and
I978 they never finished lower than
third or below .500. Quite a record.

Speaking of record records and
things, guess what baseball team has
the best record in the past 25 years.
That's right, I heard somebody say it,
the Baltimore Orioles.

While our staff was on vacation we
talked a good deal about sports, and
well, about life. Here are a few things
we decided  Captain Kirk would
have been a great manager  The

Kentucky Derby hasn't been nearly ’

as much fun since Steve Cauthen
went to England  Brian Davis needs
a nickname  Craig Heyward, who
is trying to change his image, needs
a new one, something a bit classier,
perhaps Platinum Head  Surfing
will never catch on in Pittsburgh, not
like football anyway  Pitt Stadium

thought of that? It must have taken
