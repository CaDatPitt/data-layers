BNY’s andoccupiers’ attorneys argue in court

The hearing ontthe eviction of Occupy Pittsburgh cdrnpers from Mellon Green continues,

Byjosh Won
’ Staff Writer

Vincent Eirene, a 59-year-old re-

‘ tired native- of Hazelwood, was

one of the ﬁrst Occupiers to ﬁle

into the Allegheny County Court-‘

house Tuesday morning.

“The ﬁrst two rows were ﬁlled
up by ‘the suits’ at 8 a.m.,” Eirene
said, indicating the BNY Mellon
executives who satin the court-
room’s front‘. “As” for me, these are
my Christmas clothes — what I’ve
been wearing since Christmas.”

Spectators packed into the -

hearing room, where BNY Mel-
lon’s attorney Daniel Booker, a

Pitt alumnus, argued that evicting ~

the Occupiers from their current
camp at Mellon Green did not vio-
late the protesters’ First Amend-

ment rights because therights do
not apply to private property.

Booker also cited the dangers
of ﬁres and violent-outbreaks that
might occur as a result of the oc-
cupation. . . ‘

Jules Lobel, one of the- attor-
neys volunteering to represent
the Occupiers, counteredthe

argument and said that"Mellon 

Green appears to be a public walk-
ing place that has been funded by
taxpayer dollars.

At 4:30 p.m., the hearing be- ‘

fore Allegheny County Court of

Common Pleas Judge Christine

Ward wrapped up. It is set to con-
tinue Wednesday at 9 a.m.

Romney

wins in New

Hampshire  

By Mallory Grossman
News Editor

The results of the ﬁrst Republican
presidential primary Tuesday night
indicated voter,prefer'ences that
differed signiﬁcantly from those
demonstrated in last week’s Iowa
_caucuses.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney won the New Hampshire
primary with 39 percent of the vote,
at press time when 93 percent of the
votes were counted. He made his
victoryyspeech at 8:30 p.m., when
only 19 percent of the votes had
been counted.

“Our campaign is about more
than replacing the president, it’s
about saving America’s soul,” Rom-
ney said to his supporters Tuesday
night.

Texas Rep. Ron Paul came in
second, with 23 percent of the
vote. Just like Romney, Paul made
his speech before most of the votes
had been reported. - c

“ [Romney] certainly had a clear-
cut victory, but we’re nibbling at
his heels,” Paul said. Thirty-three
percent of votes had been counted
when he made his remarks.

Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman ﬁn-
ished in third place with 17 per-_
cent of the vote, followed by former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich with
9 percent.

Huntsman has remained rela--

tively low in the national polls, stay-
ing in the single digits and usually in
last place. However, he took 39,743
of the votes in New Hampshire.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I think
we’re in the hunt,” Huntsman
said. ’

Former Pennsylvania Sen. and
Pitt alumnus Rick Santorum landed
right behind Gingrich in ﬁfth with 9
percent of the vote, a much different
result from his second—place ﬁnish

in Iowa, where he lost to Romney

by only eight votes.

The candidates will now head to
South Carolina for the next Repub-
lican presidential primary, which
will take place on_]an. 21.-

Students Illlsh for Collegiate Readership Program

Michael Ringling‘
Staff Writer

A student push for a reinstatement
of the Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram has begun. _

At Tuesday night’s Student
Government Board meeting in
Nordy’s Place — the ﬁrst public
meeting of the 2012 Board — Pitt
students used the open ﬂoor seg-
ment of the meeting to address the
Board about the postponement of
the continuation of the pilot pro-
gram that distributed copies of The
New York Times and USA Today
across campus.

“Why isthere no student input
for the change to the Collegiate
Readership Program?” Benjamin
Robinson, a senior studying eco-

 nomics and urban studies, asked

during the open floor portion of
the meeting. “[The Board] prom-
ised transparency. They promised
accountability.”

The Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram cost non- College of General
Studies students $30,500 a year,
a sum that came out of the Student
Activities Fund.

they didn’t show what our law-
yers showed — legal precedent,”
McNulty said.

Win or lose, however, the Oc-
cupiers of Mellon Green said that
they are already preparing for
camping through the winter.

. Unemployed Taylor Hall, a
22-year-old graduate of Full Sail
‘University, has winter-proofed his
tent with tarps and bundled up for
the cold months ahead.

Unfazed by whatever the ver-
dict might hold, Taylor said he
plans on staying at the camp until
he is forced to leave or is peace-
fully arrested.

SGB has the power to allocate

- the Student Activities Fund --

about $2.3 million in total — to
certiﬁed student organizations.

_The fund is replenished by the $80

fee non—College of General Studies
students pay each semester.
SGB president James Lan-

dreneau said that the Collegiate I

Readership Program’s contract
ended during the ﬁrst week of
January. Prior to winter break,
he conducted a meeting with the
current Board and the 2011 Board,

including former President Molly

Stieber.

Landreneau said that Stieber
passed the responsibility of the
program’s future on to him, and
he discussed the issue with his
Board. He said that some mem-
bers of the Board wanted to drop
the program completely, but that
a majority wanted to continue
the program with a more secure

J method of distribution.

Their reasoning for not renew-
ing the program was that only
non—College of General Studies
undergraduate students pay into
the Student Activities Fund, but
other people were picking up the

forced to leaveby spring,” he said.
But he is determined that weather
not be the reason for the park’s

. abandonment.

For Tom Coleman, a 47-year-
old carpenter who has been fol-
lowing the movement since Oc-
tober, The People’s Park is more
than a political statement.

“It’s like “The Lord of the
Rings”; in this circumstance,
you have us, the Shire,” Coleman
said gesturing to the mud-sunken
tents around him. “Up there [at
the BNY Mellon Center], you have
the Tower of Sauron.’’

* The tents at Mellon Green are a
social statement in his eyes.

“And it’s such a great story,
right?” Coleman said with a" grin.
“Because, you know, in the end,
the people of the Shire are the ones
who end up saving the world.”I

Viral video-game blog post  
unrelated to lGBTllrights  

One anonymous big brother
has gotten thousands and thou-
sands of virtual high-ﬁves this
week. .

A blog post by 20-year-old
Kristen Wolfe has gone viral,
causing people everywhere to
hear her story about two broth-
ers in a video-game store.

Wolfe writes that a 10- or
12-year-old boy accompanied
his olderteenage brother to
Gamestop, where she works.
She explains that the little
brother said he wanted a game
with a female character and a
“girl color” controller. I

The boy settled on a purple I
controller, andlwolfe said she
helped him pick out “Mirror’s
Edge,” a game with a female
protagonist. .

After a little while, the boys’
father entered the store. When_

’ he saw his son’s choices, he
scolded him and saidthat he’d
“whoop” him if he -didn’t pick
another color controller and
a manly game with guns and
ﬁghting. - I c

The older brother then pro— —
ceeded to defy his father, saying
that his younger brother should
be able to pick the game and
controller he wanted and-that
he would buywhatever game his
brother decided on. His father
glared at the older brother and
stormed outside. The younger
brother softly cried, and the ,
elder one leaned down, kissed,
him on the cheek and told him
not to worry. ,

Wolfe’s blog post has got-
ten a lot of attention for its
heartwarming story. The Huff-
ington Post even picked up the
story and tagged it with “LGBT_
Rights,”-and some commenters,
are posting about how awfully

and judgmentally the ‘father
acted. . V . . .. .
Wait a second.

We don’t think such a sim- _ '

ple recounting of events par-
ticularly stands up for LGBTQ
rights. Just because a young boy
wanted a purple controller and
avideo game with a female pro-
tagonistdoes not make him gay,

and it doesn’t make his brothert
an LGBTQ champion, either. It

just makeshim a guy who re.-

spected his little brother’s pref-

erences. _ I --

. We don’tgthink it’s appropri- 1

ate to assign larger meaning to

an event lilcethis and go;so far as V

to as,so’cia_te‘it with a movement:

that isn’t necessarily germane. .

The issue of LGBTQ rights is ‘a
separate entitygthat isn’t encap-

_ sulated within a preteen’s color
and video.-game preferences».—He ‘
— could very well be heteronorma- -

tive, as those preferences: don’.t
indicate sexuality in any way.

It’s time to‘ stopiplacing so

much emphasis onsgender, and

fortunately, times seem to be 7

changing. But its also impor- 

tant to remember not to read too‘ j
I much into stories like this one. A.

The teenage older brother

could have chosen to istandt upfto ‘
‘il‘his'-fatherfor multiple reasons
‘ -— the entire issue could well

have been less about the little

brother’s feelings and more
about the older brother’s desire’

to establish his own autonomy.
No one can truly be sure.

This story might be viral _and
heartwarming, but we think

people shouldpraise it for its .
intrinsic worth instead of tack- I

ing it onto a largermovement ——
with much moreconsequential
issues at hand — that might not
even be relevan_t. E A

STICKENG MY Nﬁﬁii QUE"

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

    
 

Thanks to the Internet, our
generation usually thinks of
“badass” as synonymous with
kung—fu cowboy Chuck Norris,
whose legacy has been aggran-
dized through endless “facts”
about men obliterated by soli-
tary roundhouse kicks and tears
that would cure cancer if he ever
cried.

But if you’re like me, you need
a different sort of hero — one
who never campaigned for ultra-
conservative Governor—turned-
pundit Mike Huckabee.‘ In that
spirit, I submit the most illustri-
ous American badass of the past '
year, or at least my favorite: Ari-
zona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

In case you lived in a sound- —
proof cave for most of 2011, here’s
the scoop on Giffords; She was
elected as a Democrat in 2006
to\serve in Arizona’s eighth con-
gressional district. Pro-choice,
aggressive in advocating for
energy independence and dedi-
cated to the expansion of health

most conservative -states, Gif-

being a known hardliner on im-

migration, consistently calling

fords publicly opposed SB 1070,

which gives Arizona police the

 
 

MCT Campus

right to randomly stop anyone
walking down the street and
detain him for failing to show
proper identiﬁcation papers. She
also supports the DREAM Act,
which allows undocumented im-
migrants brought to America as
children to serve in the armed
forces or pursue higher education
in the United States.

A true policy expert, Gif-
fords was respected even by her
peers on the other side of the
fence. Ed Honea, the mayor of
a town in Giffords’ district and
a self-identiﬁed conservative
Republican, described Giffords’
work on behalf of his town when
FEMA wanted to designate it a
ﬂood plain as “the best service
[he] ever had from a federal of-
ficial.”

Despite vandalism and threats,
Giffords was committed to being
accessible to her constituents,
and on Jan. 8, 2011, she held a
town hall meeting in a Tucson,
Ariz., supermarket.

To the shock of the nation, the
meeting was crashed by a gunman

wielding a Glock 19. The alleged

shooter, Jared Loughner, apparently fix-
ated on Giffords after a 2007 town hall
meeting at which he asked her, “How do

2 you know words mean anything?” With a

badass’s trademark intolerance for non-
sense, Giffords paused for a moment, then
answered Loughner in Spanishand moved

, on with the meeting. Years later at the 2011

meeting, Loughner allegedly shot Giffords
in the forehead at close range, then fired
intothe crowd, killing six people including
a‘ federal judge and a 9-year-old. 2

What makes Giffords a consummate

   

badass is not that she survived the attack
— that, it’s safe to say, was pure luck. The
astonishing thing in Giffords’ case is that
taking a bullet to the face not only didn’t

end her life, but failed to conclude her‘

career in the United States Congress.
You read that right. Although she has
been largely absent from'Capito1 Hill since
her shooting, she notably interrupted her
hiatus in August to ﬂy to Washington and
participate in a critical vote to raise the debt
ceiling, because who is Gabrielle’ Giffords
to let being shot in the forehead prevent
her from doing her job? She has spent the
past year undergoing about two hours of
speech and movement therapy per day. The
Boston Globe reports that hertherapists
say she is regaining function on an incred-

 

ible learning curve, sometimes grasping in
two sessions what ordinarily takes weeks
to teach, and that despite struggling with
speech and communication, she seems
to have retained all intellectual function.

And in a November interview with Diane.

Sawyer, Giffords admitted that she’s un-
dertaken this therapy with an end in mind
besides the mere satisfaction of ﬂipping
severe head trauma the bird. She wants to
be speaking well enough by May to enter
the race for re—election in 2012. .

If you think Giffords might still be too
fragile to re—enter the political fray in the

spring, here’s something worth noting: The-

Republicans in her district don’t seem to
think so. Far from tiptoeing around Gif-
fords and such evocative subjects in the

v

wake of herjanuary shooting, Republicans
held a fundraiser this September in which
they rafﬂed off a Glock 23. The fundraiser
calls to mind Matt Taibbi’s quote in a Roll-
ing Stone story on bankers: “What they
have, in the place where most of us have
shame, are extra sets of balls.” But appar-
ently the only people not offended were
Giffords and her husband, who never com-
plained or even gave comment. No doubt
Giffords has more important things to do,
like moving from near-fatal head trauma
to full electability in 18 months.

Hold all the tasteless fundraisers you"

like, Arizona Republicans. Your balls will
never be bigger than Rep. Giffords’. I

WOMEN’5 BASKETBALL

Rutgers dominates, Pitt loses th

The Scarlet Knights throttled the Panthers inside to extend their winning streak to five games.

Jasper Wilson
Staff Wri ter

No. 8 Rutgers outscored the Pitt
women’s basketball team by nearly
30 points in the paint on Tues-
day as the Scarlet Knights easily
downed the Panthers at the Pe-
tersen Events Center.

Rutgers (14—3, 3-0 Big East)
used a 40-12 advantage in the paint
to defeat the Panthers 63-39. Pitt
-—— still looking for its ﬁrst Big East
win — has lost three consecutive
games.

“The locker room, I’m sure, will I

be a little icy tonight,” Pitt sopho-
more Abby Dowd said.

Pitt (8-9, 0-4 Big East) went
nearly an entire half before man-
aging any points inside. Brianna
Kiesel managed the Panthers’ ﬁrst
points in the paint on a layup with
3:43 to go in the ﬁrst half.

“It is frustrating,” Dowd said.

—“It is frustrating [whether] you

have a lot of talent young or not.”

The Panthers missed 16 layups
over the course of the game and
looked completely overmatched
down low. Pitt’s inside players
combined to score a mere six
points, and theScarlet Knights
outrebounded the Panthers 41-
33-

“For the most part they were
pretty open layups, and I think at
the end of the day that just comes
down to focus,” Dowd said. “So
that’sjust something that individu-
als have to be responsible for.”

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
said she was disappointed in the
game. I

“I don’t think you can beat any-
body, much less a top-10 team in
the nation, missing 16 layups,” she
said.

Berenato struggled to explain
the team’s inability to convert on
such easy looks. ‘

“We’ll ﬁnd a different a way to
shoot layups, I guess,” she said.

When asked when the team’s
youth —— the Panthers are the
youngest team in Division I bas-
ketball — would stop being used as

- an excuse for poor performances,

Berenato said she had already
reached that point.
“I’m there now,” Berenato said.

 

“I’m always there. You can’t just
stay freshmen. You’re getting the
minutes. You’re getting the time.
“Expectations are high, but you
know what? That’s what Pitt’s all
about. They don’t come to Pitt for
me to have [low expectations].”
Pitt never led in’ the game and
drew even just once, 4-4, at the
beginning of the ﬁrst half. The Pan—
thers’ total of 39 points was the
lowest for the team this season.
Dowd found her shooter’s
stroke, going for nine points off 3-6
from beyond the arc, but her scor-
ing couldn’t help the Panthers.
Sophomore Asia Logan — who

 

averages 6.4 points —— led the Pan-
thers with 10 points, all of which
came in the ﬁrst half. Logan was
the only Pitt player to reach double
ﬁgures.

No Pitt frontcourt player scored
more than two points.

Rutgers was led by its trio of
Khadijah Rushdan, Monique Oliver
and April Sykes, the three of whom
accounted for 35 of the team’s 65
points.

Pitt failed to solve its chronic
turnover problem, coughing up the
ball 21 times. Rutgers made the
most of Pitt’s turnovers, scoring 29
points off turnovers to Pitt’s 4.

ird straight

 

Huailei Wang! StaffPhotographer
Soplmnmrc l\/Iarqucl Davis and the Pitt women’s basketball team fell to Rutgers 63-39 on Tuesday night.

Rutgers senior Rushdan — who
led all scorers with 14 points —
wasn’t surprised by her team’s abil-
ity to convert off Pitt’s mistakes.

“That’s what we do,” she said.
“We get points off the defense.
We’re a quick enough team to get
fast—break points.” .

Rutgers leads the Big East in
"defense, holding teams to 45.5
points per game.

The Panthers will try to pick up
their ﬁrst Big East Conference win
on Saturday at DePaul. ’ '4

“You don’t have time to dwell
on it. You just have to move on,”

Panthers
lookto
end losing
streak

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team will
look to pick up its ﬁrst Big East
win of the season tonight and end
the Panthers’ ﬁrst four-game los-
ing streak under head coachjamie
Dixon.

Pitt (11—5, 0-3 Big East) has
seemed capable of beating its op-

ponents for stretches — the Pan— ‘

thers held leads of at least seven
points in all four losses —— but the
team hasn’t been able to sustain a
high level of play.

Pitt hopes to do just that against
a tough Rutgers team (9-7, 1-2 Big
East) — who has big wins over
top—10 teams in Florida and Con-
necticut — at the Petersen Events
Center Wednesday night.

_ Junior Lamar Patterson,‘ who
has taken on a major role this sea-
son by playing more than 27 min-
utes per game, said he knows Pitt’s
intensity is there, but it needs to be
maintained for a full 4o»minutes.

The Panthers are still the na-
tional leader in rebounding mar-
gin, grabbing 13.3 more boards
than their opponents.

“We just have to be able to
sustain it,” Patterson said. “We
know exactly what we have to do.
We’re starting to do some different
things, and We’re going to get it
changed around.”

Dixon said that the Panthers’
faults don’t include his team’s ef-
fort. .

“You can’t outrebound people
by the number that we are and not
be playing hard,” Dixon said. “The
effort is there. We’ve just got to
perform better.”

- Dixon is limited in the lineup
adjustments he can make. With
starting point guard Travon Wood-
all still nursing an injury and fresh-

man center Khem Birch gone from ‘

the program, the Panthers’ head
coach will work with the same rota-
tion against the Scarlet Knights.

) “There aren’t really a lot of
other options that we have,” Dixon

_ GREGORIAN RANTS

Pittsburgh's universities should face off in ‘supramllrals’,

'schools (UCLA, Brigham Young)

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

As I begin my last semester as an

undergraduate, the mental check-

list of lasts has already started. ’
Last game in the Pitt football
student section 4 high—octane or
regular. Last soccer game covered.
Last coaching—hire press confer-

ence (hopefully).

Then there are the things I’ve
always wanted to do but never got
around to. I’ve neglected half the
restaurants in South Oakland —
and, wow, I’ve barely ever been to
Bloomﬁeld. I’ve never gone to Fuel

8: Fuddle’s Sunday brunch, since it-

only sounds like a great idea until
hitting the snooze button sounds
like a better one.

And of course the remorse spills
into the sports world. In four years
at Pitt, We sat through chants for
three different backup quarter-
backs and bounce—housed in the
Oakland Zoo, but I’ve also skimped
on wrestling, tennis and gymnas-
tics. Heck, I’ve never been to Trees

,Pool, although I imagine it smells

like chlorine. - V

Four universities reside within
three miles of the Cathedral of
Learning, but I’ve never gone to a
Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon, Car-
low or Chatham game that didn’t
involve Pitt. College life eats up so
much time that the paths of stu-
dents at different schools don’t
cross very often.

I wish I had a reason to visit
Carnegie Mellon’s library or scru-
tinize that weird pole sculpture
the school has in its quad, but it’s
a little too late for me to break
through the Pitt bubble before I
eamii-_a d,iplo'm5a':l—,— altho.ughithe

We’re not cut off. We’rejust not
given a reason or a real chance to

say, “Hello!” to the Dukes, Tartans, ,

Celtics or Cougars. But what if there
was a fun way to change that?

I introduce the supramurals.

Well, I don’t think “supra—” is
the right preﬁx. I just like it be-
cause it sounds like “super,” as in
“super intramurals.” Somebody get
a Latin major over here.

I think “extramurals” might

it looks like a synonym for club
sports. Expenses and travel domi-
nate. The Pittsburgh sup ramurals,
thanks to the proximity of the
schools, are more low-key.

Each school’s intramural pro-

erage Joe. You have your scrappy
underdog (Chatham), your city

Backyard Brawlers, except brainier

The campuses of Carnegie Mel-
lon and Pitt essentially overlap in
North Oakland, providing a natural
rivalry if there ever was one. And
although the Tartans don’t play
Pitt in NCAA sports because, well,
they’re Division III, that athletic

imbalance vanishes once you’re

pairing up Admiral Atwood against »

the Mellon Ballers — all of these
intramural team names are pend-
ing copyright.

Travel is minimal, and we’re
talking exclamation-point enter-
tainment as a payoff. Students
suddenly have a vested interest in
the outcome of a pickup basketball
game.

The schools do have plenty of
ties —_ if you ever want to, feel
free to take a class at Carnegie
Mellon —— but it’s currently like
an awkward dinner invitation from
a neighbor. You’re probably not
going to take him up on the offer.
The supramurals, though, are like
ﬁrst—date paintball, and nobody’s
going to turn that down.

Honestly, this won’t happen. At
least not in an organized fashion.
The logistics are far too daunting.
But maybe I can hope for a “Field
of Dreams” type of scenario. One
day, a champion intramural bas-
ketball team at Duquesne outgrows
its Downtown opponents and looks
for a challenge. I think we can take
’em. I “

“Whether someone starts or not might be

important to some but overall isn’t impor- « “

tan .” '
Freshman guard John Johnson and red-
shirt sophomore forward Talib Zanna re-
placed Cameron Wright and Dante Taylor,
respectively, in the starting lineup in Pitt’s
last game against DePaul.
Much of Pitt’s success in recent years

spread minutes around. With a shorter rota-
tion, fatigue could be a factor in the troubles

for the Panthers.

Senior Ashton Gibbs, chosen as Big East
Player of the Year in the preseason, has
struggled this season. He’s_ shooting just 39
percent from the ﬁeldand 36 percent from
3-point range. Gibbs is still battling an ankle
injury, but with Woodall out of the lineup, he
is forced to play more minutes.

“We’re not able to balance minutes with

our players at this point,” Dixon said. “[Gibbs]
may be playing more minutes than he could
with his ankle, but it is getting better. He’s
obviously not 100 percent.”

Gibbs didn’t attribute any of his struggles

S to an injury or fatigue.

“I’ve always been in shape, so I don’t think
it’s hurting me as much as people think it is,”
Gibbs said.» “I gotto start making shots. It’s
tougher, but at the end of the day, that’s the
way it is.” , l V . ‘ 2

As a senior and a leader on offense, Gibbs
has been asked to carry Pitt through a tough

2 spot, and he is embracing that role.

“I’m trying to step up to the challenges the
best thatl can,” Gibbs said. “I just got to step
it up. It_’s a big part of ‘me that I have to do my
job and have everyone step up to my lead.”

The Panthers will look to fall back on solid '

defense to defeat Rutgers. . .
. “We’ve got to guard the ball,” Dixon said.

' “We have to do a better job against penetra.-..

tion. I think some of our turnovers have led

of why our ﬁeld-goal percentage on defense
is hig .” ' ~
Dixon’s staple man-to-man defense -has
been replaced by a zone defense often this
season, but-the Panthers are still struggling
to get stops. .

“We’ve work_ed'on the zone,” Dixon said.
“We’ve tried different things, and it hasn’t
worked too well in the games that we have
used it. It’s something that we work on every
day.” _

This year’s Panthers have worked on the
zone more so than previous teams, and they
are comfortable running it in the game.

“We’re effective in practice when we use
it,” Gibbs said. “We’ve been doing it every
single day. We’re used to it, so if we play it in
a game it won’t be anything.”

Former Pitt assistant Mike Rice leads the
Scarlet Knights. He coached under Jamie
Dixon during the 2006-2007 season and
then moved on to become the head coach of
Robert Morris from 2007 to_ 2010.

Rutgers fell on its home court to then—No.
2 Pitt 65-62 last season and has lost three
straight games in the series, as wellas 11 of
the last 12.

*' The Scarlet Knights are coming off a 67-60

win over No. 8 Connecticut during which they
held the Huskies to 37.7 percent shooting and

forced 20 turnovers — _a strength they could _

-take advantage of against the Panthers.
' Freshman guard Eli Carter leads Rutgers
with 14.2 points per game. Carter, the Big East

Rookie of the Week last week, scored 19 points i

in the win over the Huskies. Sophomore for-
ward Gilvydas Biruta also averages double
ﬁgures with 10.5 points and 4.5 rebounds
per game. .
A loss to Rutgers would extend Dixon’s los-

S ing streak to ﬁve games, and that’s something

that none of the players want to be known
for. Patterson said he uses the errors to grow
as a player. ’

‘‘It’s tough. No one wants to lose that many
games in a row — or a game period,” Patter-
son said. “It’s just something that we can grow
off and learn from our mistakes.” I
