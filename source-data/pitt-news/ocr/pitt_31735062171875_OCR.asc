Slated F or Philly

Housing Forum Set

by MIKE SIMON
Night Editor

A two-day seminar in Philadel-
phia centering on the problems of
off campus housing, partially
sponsored by Student Association
(SA) Committees Commissioner
Wade Lawson, is tentatively
scheduled for the weekend of
either March 26 or April 2.

Lawson described the seminars
purpose as two-fold. “It is being
held for all schools," he said, “to
gather information about off cam-
pus housing and to centralize ac-
tivity into an organized central
action and information service."

At the conference a series of
workshops dealing with all facets

of off campus housing is planned.

Workshops tentatively will deal
with contracts and leases, the pos-
sible development of a “universal
lease” which would express the
views of both students and land-
lords and eliminate non-negoti-
able leases; health inspection;
present housing laws, the process
of subletting, and the organiza-
tion of a referral agency to ban-
dle snbletting for tenants.

Also slated is the possible for-
mation of a centralized inspection

Posvar

by JIM MAC

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, in
meetings with his staff, has ex-
pressed a desire to see an increas-
ed diversification of out-of-state
students in future freshmen classes.

According to Bernard Kobosky,
Vice Chancellor of Student Af-
fairs, and Ken Wenger, Dean of
Admissions and Student Aid, the
Chancellor feels that “a wider va-
riety of non-Pennsylvanian stu-
dents would be both beneficial to
the University and the student
bodyf’

Within the past two or three
years, reported Wenger, the per-
centage of out-of-state students
has leveled off to around nine or
10 per cent of the total enroll-
ment.

“The Chancellor would not al-

ter this figure,” Wenger said, -

“but he would change the make-
up of that 10 per cent. Now, most

agency to assure reasonable
housing for students.

Off campus housing is viewed
by Lawson as the “number one
problem" facing large urban uni-
versities. He said, “If not dealt
with adequately, insufficient off
campus housing could seriously
hurt the future enrollment poten-
tial.

The Commissioner also men-
tioned the possibility of a meeting
with Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (HUD) officials to find out
how the federal government views
the urban areas and their eligibil-
ity for governmental funding.

Though representatives will be
sent from Pitt, Penn State, Tem-
ple, Drexel, nearly all of Pennsyl-
vania's large schools. any stu-
dents interested are urged to go.

Further details as to the exact
date of the conference and other
incidental information will be re-
leased shortly.

Counseling Center May .    
House Rubel-less PESO   

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

PESO, the Post-Baccalaureate
Educational services 0ff'i'ce
may have anew home in the
future. Administrators have been

. considering moving the office to

the Counseling Center on the sec-
ond floor of the Student Union.

Currently. the office, which
counsels students on post-grad-
uate education and helps them ob-
tain fellowships and scholarships,
is housed on the tenth floor of the
Cathedral of Learning as part of
the College of Arts and Sciences.

Until this month, PESO was
headed by June Rubel who tender-
ed her resignation before the

. move was proposed.

Jerome Schneewind, Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences.

explained the rationale behind the
proposed move.

- SCHNEEWIND’S PRIORITIES

Because of the financial crisis
at the University, Schneewind had
to deal with a limited budget. He
had to develop a list of funding
priorities.

“I couldn‘t get all the money.
Something has to give," he said. I

had a choice of developing a pro-

gram of experimental courses, in-
creasing thestaff of the lower
advisors‘ board, or increasing
funds to PESO.

“PESO was the lowest on prior-
ities of the College,” he said.

Schneewind said it came last
on the list of priorities because it
does not deal‘ uniquely with stu-
dents enrolled in the College, but
with all students enrolled in the
University.

Tight Market Pinches
Senior Job Offers

by TOM HEIPLE

Seniors ' along with students
from other city campuses are en-
countering some difficulties in
finding postgraduate jobs.

Although recruitment is off by
g 30 per cent this year, Ernest Hol-
mok, director of the University
Placement Center, believes, “It
still isn’t a bad recruiting season.
Any student who wanted to could
have had 10 interviews.“ He add-
ed that the number of actual job
offers made to students, how-
ever, has dropped by over half.

“There’s no pattern to it," he
said, referring to the decline.
“I’ve had cancellations from all
types of industries.”

Holmok believes a graduate de-
gree helpful but noted that Ph.D.’s
in chemistry and physics are

having their troubles. They are
having fewer interviews and less
encouragement.

At other campuses, the situa-
tion varies.

J. Dennis Ryan, placement di-
rector at Carnegie-Mellon, re-
ported a 30-40 per cent decline in
recruitment with another month
to go. “The ones who interviewed
in most cases reported having
fewer jobs. Chemical and metal-
lurgical engineers have not been
hit nearly as hard as aerospace
and electronics,” which be de-
scribed as being “thumped.”

“The liberal arts student has
always had a bad time finding a
job,” he said, “but may not take
quite the ‘thumping’ electronics
and aerospace have.”

“Although it normally enhances

Eyes West, South

of our non-Pennsylvania students
are from West Virginia, Ohio, or
New York. We would like to see
more students from areas outside
these neighboring states, from
places like California, Oklahoma,
and the South.”

sylvania residents pay $1,960

yearly tuition; resident students
pay $850.

“It is unrealistic," Kobosky
said, “to expect much of an in-
crease in the proportion of non-
resident to resident students. We
can never have the 35 per cent out-
of-state enrollment that we had
before state-relatedness. But our
first responsibility as a state-re-
lated school is to our own stu-
dents. It would be wrong for us to
turn down Pennsylvania students
of better quality just to admit
more non-residents. "

Plans to achieve this wider di-
versification are “very indefi-
nite,” but both Kobosky and Wen-
ger stressed that the methods
would not involve monetary allow-
ances.

“Probably," Wenger said, “to
get this type of non-resident stu-
dent, we’d have to admit only
those who could afford to pay. “

the chances for a job, an advanced
degree hasn’t helped the last cou-
ple of years," Ryan stated. “This

is where we first notice the de-"

cline in the economy."

Ryan noted that many place-
ment directors are comparing the
present job market to the winding
down of hostilities at the end of
the Korean. War, a situation
which is being repeated, he be-
lieves, in Vietnam.

“About 20 per cent of industrial
and government recruiters have
cancelled,” said Robert Waldron
of Duquesne. As at Pitt, the hard-
est hit fields have been scienti-
fic disciplines such as chemistry
and biology. As for retail organ-
izations, the biggest recruiter,
about as many as last year are in-
terviewing.

Waldron added that in the long
run, the job squeeze may prove to
be a boon to graduating engineers,
in that some companies, instead
of paying huge salaries to engi-
neers with 10-15 years experi-
ence, may decide to take on a re-
cently graduated engineer as a
trainee.

Don Pavlik, placement direc-
tor at Robert Morris, which con-
centrates on secretarial and busi-
ness administration training, said
secretaries are having no prob-
lems, but jobs for business ad-
ministration majors are down
almost 40 per cent.’He's hopeful of
a break soon but doesn‘t think it
likely for June graduates.

Chatham College appears to be
in the safest position where pri-
marily secondary schools and the
federal government recruit.
"We’ve never had a huge number
of recruiters," explained Miss
O'Hara, the placement director.
She described the condition as be-

, ing “relatively static.”

 

 

march 19, 1971 .

“My first responsibility is what
happens to students in the Col-
lege," he explained.

Scheewind feels that the func- . '..- . '
tions of PESO fit more naturally
into the Counseling Center. The
Center already has a Career Li-
brary which could be combined’
with PESO to give more effee-’_3 ;
tive post-graduate job and educa- '
tion counseling to students.

TUESDAY DECISION I ,
Dr. Robert Gallagher, director
of the Counseling Center, ap-
proves of the proposed move.

The future of PESO will be de- ‘ ~
cided at a meeting next Tuesday. ’_ -
Schneewind, Gallagher and
others connected with PESO will
discuss the proposal with Bern-
ard Kobosky, Vice Chancellor, of
Student Affairs.

JUNE RUBEL

The administrators will also de- ‘_ ‘
cide if the various committees
concerned with fellowships such
as the Fulbright should be cen- . 
tralized under one office.  ,_ _. 

RUBEL RESIGNS . 7 

June Rubel, head of the office . _.
for the past three years, has re- "
signed, effective March 31. She

  

 

- has beenon sick leave sincethe

first week of March.

Rubel said she left her position
because she “found no provision 
being made for the expansion of _ "C" .»
the office or for fulfilling prom- ’ 
ises that were made.” '

“There was no point in my "go-'1 
ing on,” she said.

Rubel, who is also a leader in
Pittsburgh's Women’s ‘Liberation 
movement, hinted that her in-
volvement with the feminists '
may have been the reason she
could not get enough funds for her
office.

“It’s a bigger issue than me,”
she claimed. “For women who be-
lieve they have a potential, that of-
fice was a key.”

Schneewind denied that Rubel’s
feminist activities had anything
to do with her limited budget.
“I’m a very strong supporter of
the feminist movement,” he said.

The Dean agreed that Rubel had
felt frustrated. “I think she has
had more work than she can han-
dle. Resources were inadequate.”

 Greél:.s- Festivities
  IF C, Pan-Hel Hold
lfrives For Charity

by STEVE ZYCH
The Greeks, as part of this
year’s March 22-27 Greek

Week, are out for blood and money.

The blood is for Central Blood
Bank; the money is for Children’s
Hospital.

Blood will be collected next Fri-

day in the Student Union Ball- 

room between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
All donors are eligible for the Cen-
tral Blood Bank family plan
which donors and their relatives
are covered for loss of blood for
ayear.

Dean Louis McLinden, advisor

A to the Greeks, noted that “in the

past, very few of the donors or
their relatives have needed any
blood, thus there has always been
a surplus. We’ve been able to don-
ate the excess to such organiza-
tions as the Leukemia Fund and
Children’s Hospital.

Children’s Hospital will also be
the beneficiary of the Charity
Drive which the Greeks are

launching on Monday. It will last
through Wednesday. A

“The average amount we raise
is usually around $2,500,” said

McLinden, “and we expect to at_
least match that this year. It all.

depends on the generosity of those

approached,” stated McLinden.

 

Queen’

Rep laced

The traditional Greek Week
Queen contest has been replaced
his year with a talent contest for
orority representatives.

“Women’s liberation has made
s think whether or not a title of
Queen’ is revelant,” said Frank
Martin, co—chairman of the talent
ontest. “I feel that the queen
sn’t necessary. She serves no
eal purpose or function during
he year.” i

The fund raising is done by the
individual fraternities and soror-
ities as well as jointly by the Inter
Fraternity Council and Panhellen-
ic Council. For the joint solicita-
tion the various collectors will
dress up in clown costumes.

As an incentive, the Greeks will
earn points equal to the amount of
money each fraternity or sorority
brings in. All events during Greek
Week, which begins Mondayand
ends Saturday, will be judged and
awarded points accordingly.

The remainder of the Greek
Week schedule is as follows:

Monday: 12 p.m.—“Kick Off”
at Bigelow Blvd. 6 p.m.—“Fun
Night” at Trees Hall.

Tuesday: Queen’s Talent Contest
and IFC Awards, 7 p.m. at the
YM and WHA auditorium.

. Wednesday: Greek Sing, Carnegie
Music Hall, 6:30 p.m.

Thursday: Dinner, featuring band,
SU Ballroom, 5-8 p.m., follow-
ed by a movie,‘Goodbye Mr.
Chips at 9 p.m.

Friday: Greek Week Formal, 9
p.m. at Chatham Center.

Saturday: Concert with Steppen-
wolf, 8 p.m. at Syria Mosque.
Admission price for the concert
is $7 per couple.

Ten women will compete in the
ontest, one representing each
orority. Karen Bundy, Martin’s
 co—chairman, said that the contest
gwould be based on “talent and
 performance.”

5 “There will be a winner and
 first and second runners up,” said
§Bundy. “We haven’t decided on
Ewhat the winner will be called,‘
 however, but the idea of a queen
3 is out.”

Sponsored by the Inter Frater-
3 nity Council and Panhellenic
‘Council, the contest will take
place Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the
YM and WHA auditorium.

 
 
  
  

Martin said that  . . next year,
we’d like to expand the talent con-
 test to include men.”

THERE will be a meeting of the
Undergraduate Math Commit-
tee Tuesday, March 23, in
room 306, SU, at 4 p.m. All
math majors are invited.

Any male freshman having l2

- credits of letter grades with a
3.5 or better QPA at the end

Scab Lettuce Out 

The Food Service Policy Com-
mittee, composed of Housing Di-
rector John Vrana, Assistant
Housing Director Will Miller, and
student participants, proposed re-
cently that SAGA Food buy only
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee (UFWOC) lettuce, in
compliance with the lettuce boy-
cott.

The committee’s proposal re-_
sulted from the Chicano students’
boycott on non-UFWOC lettuce.

Their proposal, included in the
last edition of the Resident As-
sistant Newsletter, said:

“We move that SAGA Food Serv-
ice buy UFWOC or Black Eagle
lettuce on a daily basis for use in
all campus food facilities as it is
available and with consideration to
quality.”

“We further ask that the Direc-
tor of SAGA Food Service report
to the Committee on the success
or lack hereof in complying with
this request within 30 days.

“In addition, Gary Dalton, man-
ager of the Medical Center
Nurses’ Residence has been di-
rected to purchase Black Eagle
lettuce exclusively.”

Gary Christoffersen, SAGA
Food Service director, said Wed-
nesday that he is able to purchase
Black Eagle lettuce 80 to 90 per
cent of the time, depending upon
its availability, in compliance
with the boycott request, while
maintaining SAGA’s meal con-
tract to students.

ON Monday, March 22, in
conjunction with Vietnam
Week being sponsored by the
People's Peace Treaty Commit-
tee, will feature a full evening
of programming.

The program will include
the film May Day which de-
picts the present situation in
Vietnam and plans for anti-
war demonstrations in Wash-
ington this May.

Also on the program will be
a Women's folk-rock group and
a theatre group, the Third
World Revelations.

Nancy Phaller and Chip Mar-
shall will be on hand to an-

swer questions about the Pea-.
ple's Peace Treaty and the
plans for the May Action in
Washington starting May 2.
Chip Marshall is presently un-
der indictment for the Federal
Anit-Riot Act and Conspiracy
and is one of the Seattle eight.
The program will be held in
244 CL at 8 p.m.

On Tuesday, March 30, at 8
p.m. Rennie Davis will speak
at the Duquesne Union Ball-
room. Davis is one of the de-
fendants in the Chicago Con-
spiracy Trial and a well-
known anti-war activist.

Fall 1970 Course Evaluation
65 Pages—Free

Last year, a newspaper editor
sent shock waves through the lit-
erary world when he asked in-
terested members of his staff to
each write one lewd, nonsensical,
disgusting chapter in the life of a’
voyeur. The editor warned his
conspirators that any “ writing
that smacked of a decency would
be severely blue-penciled.

The result was a racy best-
seller called Naked ‘Came-the
Stranger. The book was little
more than pornography, the ulti-
mate obscenity of which was the
amazing alacrity the public dis-
played gobbling it up.

Here at the University, a group
of ambitious and inventive jour-
nalists have undertaken a similar
experiment; the ensuing novel is,
happily, a landmark in contem-
poraryxfiction.

Called Fall, 1970, Course Eval-
uation, this 65 page jewel ought.
to be conspicuously at the top of
your reading list. The book rides
roughshod over hallowed literary
traditions, emerging as a neo-bar}
oquebible for university life.

Evaluation has no consistent
style. The melange of styles of the
17 authors who created this work
reflects the heterogeneity of a
large metropolitan university. ’
The subtle inconsistencies and
faux pas woven into the texture of
thegnovel mirror the interstices
of our arcane existence.

The chapters (there are 344 of
them) are set up in the epic tradi-
tion. For instance, the title of‘
Chapter 8 dealing with Anthropol-
ogy 146 is simply “Anthropology

. 146.” «

And there is no scheme to the

division or placement of chapters.

After reading for a while, you may
believe you’ve solved the mystery
of the chapters, thinking that they
have been alphabetized. Socko.
There’s a “C” after an “S,{’ and
the .meaning of life eludes you
again.

  Heroism in the Cafeteria

‘by BERYL s. HANDLER
and JEFFREY 1). LEHMAN

’   Ladies and gentlemen.

We are gathered here tonight on this momentous

>~ aoccasion to commemorate the heroism and selfless

daring of one of the great heroes of our time—the

V V g ‘ honorable John Medaris. Though only a beginner in
A =_: *—t‘ne world of SAGA dining, John Medaris has dem-

‘onstrated the courage and fearless acuity of a full-

 j fledgedVSAGA veteran. V .
‘ , ‘ On the night of March 16, 1971, John Medaris did
 “that, which each and every one of us has always
v   longed to do. In the face of overwhelming odds (ten
‘ bitchy SAGA helpers), John summoned up the suffi-
"  -,cien't spiritual strength to bring himself to an act so
'2 defiant and so heroic that it will be surely be im-
a Winortalized in the annals of College Cafeteria
V history. s '
7‘ I He has brought our most cherished dreams to
_ ‘fruition; he is of that breed of man who does not
a .; .know the meaning of the word “fear.” He will reap
‘a many glories as his dining career achieves ma-
“. j . turity, but always this first triumph will be the one A
 most sweetly remembered. '

~ John Medaris, on that eventful night, hurled a

 ‘ glass of flaming red juice onto the Cafeteria “a”
 Mfloor, leaving in its wake countless puddles, count-
*3,.’les._s stains, and countless bits of shattered glass.
 *’ What frightful occurrences led John Medaris to such

‘drastic measures as to endanger his and his com-

Chapter layout, like everything
in this exquisitely planned book,
is designed to confuse. English
Professor Segel is, numerically
first, given an V“average” overall
rating. One line later, we learn
that students disliked everything
about the instructor. It is through
juxtapositions such as these that
Evaluation best conveys its sense
of meaninglessness.

 

CRITIC Evan Pattak fires poison
barbs at best-seller.

The language of the book often
tumbles overthe barriers of tra-
ditional metaphor. Lines such as
“Dr. Sheon is a very interesting
lecturer” echo and swirl through
the eddies of despair. Not all of
the prose is that dynamic; none of
it though is every ordinary.

Many other techniques are used O

to heighten the effect of chaos.
Print is often garbled, leaving the
reader to guess at the intent of

the authors. A particularlyeffec- V

tive innovation is the scribbling of
supposedly typical student com-
ments on the covers of the book.

, Some of these bits are precious
and priceless, such as “He. is to
bias in his opinion.” The aut‘.‘.10I"S

clever use of misspelling and in-‘ 

correct grammar gives one the
awareness of student stupidity.

Yet perhaps the novel.s great-

V est achievement is in folding the

questionnaire inside the backcov—
er. Just as you think you’ve ended
the -novel. you come upon the key

to it all, the only device that will , ’

render any of the novel intelligible
and you’ve got to start over. The

cycle of life repeats itself and you .
_ can only graspa part of it.

The book isinot without its flaws.
It is rather heavy on statistics.
Also, only one German course is
reviewed. I’m not sure that this
rather heavy-handed denuncia-
tion of neo-Nazism comes off.

But the novel scores in almost

. every area. Read it again and

again. The price is right.

The Great Controversy:

  WhatCan You Do?

by RICH McDONOUGH
Staff Columnist

It had been years since we had
seen each other. But then, a death
in the .family, and we were drawn
into a group. The family was, of
course, shocked with me, or rath-
er with my long black hair falling

« past my shoulders. Naturally in

their eagerness to be rude they
forgot the occasion that had
brought us together. ’

“Different
from the rest
of us are ya?
Is yer hair the
seat of your in-
rdividualism?”
I was tempted
to reply, “No,
its the seatof . - ~  -  --
my defiance AMCDONOUGH

for assholes like you," but in-
stead, in a superior tone of voice,
I calmly said, “Perhaps, but I

suspect the differences between

us run far beyond the hair.”

They weren’t all hostile though.
One of my uncles approached.
“I’d like to talk to you, Dick. I
don’t care about the hair‘. You
should see ‘my kids. Ain’t.straight

. like yours. Sticks out a foot on

each side. A

“My boy dropped out of school
though, did ya know that? Got a
two-year degree then decided he

‘ wanted out. Probably the best de-

cision. There’s a lot more who
shouldn’t be there either. They
ought to throw half of them out.”

“Perhaps this is a man of intelli-
gence,” I reflected. I thought of
most of the people I know—fami-
Vliar thoughts. People wasting four
years, shallow boys chasing shal-

low girls, alcohol and dope——peop-
ple not committed to anything ex-
cept , thetpursiiit of rnediocrity. ;

people obsessed with clothes and

status. Can’t they see that they V

-can’t buy masculinity or feminin-

ity at a sportswear shop? Don’t
they understand that the status
they seek is a status among fools?

But there were also the faces of ii a
the few, the very few, people that ~

I 1ove—Susan, Mike, Eric and a
few more. People intent on living

simple, honest, beautiful lives, de- *

the rest die, never knowing what
they are or what they can be? Sad-
ness overwhelmed me. Sadness
for those whoVare incapable of lov-
ing, of understanding me precise-
ly because I love them. They can’t
understand that I must live the
kind of life that I do, free, wishing
no harm to no one——the only kind
of life worthy of philosopher. ,

and his words shattered my“

Students Question
Activity Fee Use

Editor :

After attending a meeting of
the Student Union Social Board,
I was totally apalled at the ut-
ter confusion and disorganiza-
tion.

Our reasons for attending the
meeting were to become more
informed on how our student ac-
tivity fees are being utilized; in-
cidently, there is a proposal in
the making for an imminent in-
crease of the student activity
fee.

We questioned Lenny Kla-
vonic, Social Commissioner, in
reference to negligent squan-
dering of funds allocated for
concerts (for example, Freak
Week’s concert) and special
week events (Homecoming).

== Klavonic corroborated the fact
that such events were operating
at a loss and failed to reason-
ably substantiate why there were
no attempts made to thoroughly
scrutinize the value of such
events at perpetual deficit and
enlist alternatives and strategies
for better entertainment with
improved usage of allocations.

Do you think that your fees
are being competently spent
and merit an increase? Another
example of the Board’s illogical

programming is a dance schedul-
ed for March 19th in the Stu-
dent Union. Three days before
this scheduled dance no enter-
tainment had been contracted;
however, the committee seemed
satisfied to offer second-rate en-
tertainment. while verbally ac-
knowledging the fact of a possi-
ble loss of over $300.

Realizing such a move was un-
warranted, we strongly protest-
ed on the grounds that funds
could be channeled towards a
more organized event at a later
date. Should we suffer because
of the apparent incompetence of
others‘?

Competently yours,

Seni0r’s Registration 'Virgilly’ Impossible

Editor:

As all Pitt students have pro-
bably found, it is difficult to re-
gister for courses in the Art De-
partment. They are popular and
are usually closed by the end
of the first few days of registra-
tion. As a sophomore I was told
to wait until my senior year. As
a senior, I would have first
chance at the registrars.

Well, I am a senior and it’s
now impossible to gain admit-
tance to either Studio Arts 10 or
20.

It is impossible because Virgil

‘Cantini, chairman of the Depart-

ment has run away with the
course cards. This great artist -
teacher, who has not taught an
undergraduate course during
my years at Pitt, and who for
the last semester. has been us-
ing my tuition money for his
own personal artistic and tin-
ancial enrichment —- this artistic
seer of Pittsburgh has suddenly
materialized and chosen to close
these courses except to Fresh-
men and Sophomore Art Majors.

In effect, he has single hand-
edly frozen all course cards, and

Life" at the corner of the Penn
and Highland Malls in the East

founded the Virgil Cantini Me-

morial (he’s not around much

any more) Art School at Pitt.
Needless to say I feel he has

overstepped his rights as a Pro-
fessor and/or Chairman. Since

I’ve paid my tuition, or will pay ’

it the same way Art Majors will, 0
I feel it’s my right to-,.ha.ve--.-an. 

equal chance at those courses.
There are many fine

Schools in Pa., many more in

the US, and a lot more ingthe

‘world; I would appreciate it if

he would give me back my
course card, and if he feels Art
Majors should have a better
chance for practicing art, pro-
vide transportation for them to
the nearest art school. ‘

Better yet, let him teach a lit-

tle bit more and take up some of’ ‘O

the slack. A ,
As far as I know other artists -

Renoir, Picasso etc. didn’tcom- ‘

plain about Art Majors not get-
ting enough attention. But then

again, they didn’t draw big sal-  "

aries from universities either.

No Virgil, my heart doesn’t.
bleed for the poor little fresh-
men and sophomore art majors

who can’t get into the courses. 
As for you, you should be com- ~ g y .-

Opt For Life,
Not Death

Editor. The Pitt News:

In the .\larch 8 issue of the Pitt
News, an article about abortion
described how the poor cant af-
ford abortions as sterile and clean
in hospitals  the rich.

The fact is that all medical serv-
ice l€..~r the poor are unfair. and ot
poorer quality compared to the
paying patient.

How about better medical care
for the old poor, the babies of the
poor, and the poor expectant
mothers and endless other age
groups and illnesses of the poor
that need attention‘?

Lets concentrate the medical
improvements for the poor on life-
preserving solutions rather than
death solutions as in abortions.

Sincerely.
Joan Derrick

“What I tiled to do in compos-

trified."

So spoke I)avid Spangler. coin-
poser of the music for the Univer-

Night‘s Dream. The versatility
and creativity suggested by the
music are in fact an understate-

poser.

Spangler. age 22. is not onl_v

From the very beginning. he
saw drama and music as being in-
separable.

Originally from Salina. Kas.
Spangler received a scholarship
to Denver Academy of Theater
Arts after his mother moved to
that city. In high school. he di-
vided his time between song writ-
ing. acting. playing music. and
performing in various talent re-
views.

His first real attempt at a pro-
duction of musical drama came
during his senior year in high
school with A Century of Broad-
way. which he wrote, directed,
and accompanied on piano.

  

DAVID SPANGLER, diverse young musician, composed the music for the
University production A Midsummer Night's Dream which closes tomor-

row evening.

dent. He first became interested
in music when he was seven. as a
result of-watching the movie ver-
sion of Porgy and Bess. When his
mother bought him a toy organ.
he began picking out the tunes
from the musical. as well as Eddy
Duchin songs.

“Mother immediately thought I

was a musical genius,” Spangler'

related. “She bought me an “up-
right” and arranged for me to
take lessons from my aunt.”

To fill the void created by the

dropping of the freshman Eng-

lish requirement, the English
department will offer this fall

’ seven composition courses open
‘ to all undergraduates. Providing
, - for students of varied abilities
g_ and interests, the courses range

in nature from elementary to ad-
vanced.

Each course except the Work-
shop is a three-credit course and
will be offered in both the Fall
and Winter terms. The Work-
shop carries no credits. In the
Winter ’72 term, two interdepart-
mental courses, Language and
the Research Paper, will be ad-
ded.

The new program is designed
to interest both weak writers

. The Comparative Literature
Program (CLP), initiated two
years ago, will expand in the
fall with eight new courses and
faculty members new
to the program.

Among the new courses being
CLP 103: Modern
Methods of Research in the Hu-
manities. a team—taught course

‘ focusing on research methodol-

ogy and problem analysisgin the
humanities. The course will be

, A -taught in conjunction with the
*  staff of Hillman Library.

Doctors Edward Dudley and
co-chairmen of
the program, will teach CLP

123: 20th Century Prose Narra-

‘ tive, and Dr. William Searle of

the English Department has
joined the program to teach
WCLP 162: The Myth of Nar-
cissus.

Other flew courses for the fall
term include: CLP 105: Aesthe-
tics: CLP 110: iconography and

Allegory; CLP 163: Don Juan
and CLP 125: European Ro-
. manticism.

Two current courses will be
combined in CLP 164: Span-
ish Civil War and its Litera-
ture taught by Doctors Colodny
and Gonzalez of the History and
Spanish Departments, respec-
tively.

The program at the University
is one of only a few undergrad-
uate Comparative Literature
programs in the country and one
of the first to have been initiat-
ed at the undergraduate level.

Although the University of-
fers no graduate courses in the
field, a methodology course is
being planned to train gradu-
ate students and teaching assist-
ants in the methods of teach-
ing languages and literature.

Several schools, including
Yale, the University of Califor-
nia, and Harvard, offer graduate
degrees in the field.

Any undergraduate major who
has completed the equivalent of
four terms of a foreign lang-
uage, taken CLP 101: Compara-
tive Literary Methods, and 21
credits in the Comparative Lit-
erature Program, is eligible for

a Certificate in Comparative Lit-
erature.

The program is essentially an
integration of the humanities
and the social sciences, with
faculty members from many de-
partments, including English,
Linguistics, Music, History, and
Sociology.

“The program developed right
on the heels of the abolition of
the language requirement,” said

’ Doctor Landy. “Part of its ra-

tionale is to stimulate interest
in the languages and literature
of other countries.

The CLP is currently sponsor-
ing a lecture series which will
bring Stephen G. Nichols of
Dartmouth College to speak on
Love and Death in the Medie-
val Lyric, March 22 at 8 p.m. in
the Graduate School of Public
Health Auditorium.

Geoffrey Hartman of the De-
partment of English and Com-
parative Literature at Yale will
speak May 6 on a topic to be
announced.

mechanics, and usage. Other
problems will be discussed in
small groups or individually as
needed.

Elementary Composition — also
for students with little exper-
ience in writing, this course will
emphasize development of the
sentence, paragraph, and multi-
paragraph paper. Fullness and
logic of development as well as
correctness and clarity will be
important points of writing stress-
ed. Students will also learn to
distinguish between the inter-
esting and the banal in content
and style.

General Composition — closest
in content to what used to be
freshman English, the course
will stress the relation of the
speaking voice to the audience,
subject and development of a
subject from knowledge and re-
search patterns of organization.
Students will also be made aware
of logic of arrangement and con-
tent, in addition to levels of
abstraction on matters of defin-
ition and classification.

Writing the Argument — cri-
tical thought will be taught
through instruction on the steps
in organizing and presenting an
effective argument, judging the
validity of materials, and on
logic and clarity of presenta-
tion.

Critical Writing — critical
thinking and reading, and clear
and cogent expression in writing
will be stressed through examin-
ation of various literary mater-
ials. Where some sections will
be concerned with criticism of
literature, others may use his-
torical or scientific materials,
or material from any discipline

other than English. Content will
depend on the interests of the in-
structor and students.

Imaginative Writing —~ empha-
sis will be on analysis of profes-
sional prose and the students‘
own writing, with the content
determined by the interests of the
group.

Advanced Composition — the
course will concentrate on the
more complex problems of com-
position, such as problems of
style in precision, emphasis, and
implication. Frequent sessions
with students criticizing each
others’ papers and frequent con-
ferences will be held.

‘Language -— this interdepart-
mental course will include week-
ly or bi-weekly writing on sub-

" jects related to language, with

content still to be determined.

The Research Paper — also an
interdepartmental course, this
will involve writing research pa-
pers in the humanities, the social
sciences, and the natural" sci-
ences.

A new course studying the
works of twentieth century
writers has been added to
the English department cur-A
riculum. Numbered English
135, the course will be offer-
ed Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 4-5:20 pm.

Teachers Nancy Donnelly
and Judy Rosenthal plan to
examine the works of such
authors as Virginia Woolf,
Dorothy Parker, and Eudora
P Welty in informal discussion,
groups. Records, tapes, and
movies will supplement the
literature.

Too Close
To Home

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

Maybe it is appropriate. that in a year strewn with attacks

 

on the Athletic Department at Pitt, 1, the incoming sports edi-
tor, should be confronted with a criticism of that department
which originates right here at the Pitt News, in_ my own back-

yard. ‘

As the transition from the old editorial staff to the new one

occurred, with it came a change in attitude toward Pitt sports. I

I want to take this opportunity to emphasize that the statement
on the editorial page in Wednesday’s paper does not represent
my opinion, or the opinion of-the spbrts staffregarding Pitt

athletics.

The initial critique‘ centered around the Athletics Depart-
ment’s ability to give out scholarships toathletes regardless of
financial need. The practice of giving out academic scholarships
to incoming students based solely on academic excellence was

discontinued by the University some
time ago. This constitutes an inconsis-
tency in the University’s policy toward
financial aid and might even be con-
sidered a case of discrimination.

“If it were up to me,” commented
Athletic Director Casmir « Myslinski
i when he was confronted with the prob-
lem, “there would be no scholarships
at all-—only grants-in-aid, or .low in-

terest loans.” -

But if Myslinski were to follow his
plan here at Pitt he would automatical-
ly place himself out of the running

 

CASMIR MYSLINSKI

for the top high school athletes in the country when recruiting
time comes alongfln other words, the Athletic Director can’t
do it himself. He needs the support of schools around the nation
in order to force a ruling out of the NCAA. He has tried though.

“We can’t do it on our “own,” began the Athletic Director.
“If the NCAA suggested that athletic scholarships be eliminated
then things would have to change.’ We have suggested-it to the

NCAA.”

X

“We made a proposition this year to them that scholarships
be based only on need,”'he continued. “But you run into a prob-
lem there because who is to define where there is need. We’re a
member of the Big Four, S-yracuse, Pitt, West Virginia, and
Penn State, which allows us to give out a total of 100 football
scholarships over four years. We have a limitation that forces

us to keep it in bounds.”

When you consider the athlete on scholarship with his room,
board, tuition and books already paid for him, you get the im-
pression that he is in the same class as a paid performer. But
isn’t the newspaper writer that gets paid for his work also do-
ing a service and getting rewarded for it? The student on schol-
arship is only required to come to school and take his courses.

‘ L The athlete spends hour after hour working out at his particular
skill,.day after day, week after week.”

It is certainly the Athletic Department's position to rec-
ommend a re-evaluation of the recruiting procedure as it pre-
sently exists. But this is a task that they cannot accomplish
alone. In the interim, the athlete should not be made to suffer.

“If you have the capability,

concludes Myslinski, “then

it’s a damn shame if you can’t use it.” --

In Track ’7l?%E

  

by VINCE DiNARDO

Summing up his career at Pitt
the other day, Jerry Richey
thought it unfortunate that track
was not a team sport.

“In track theresis only one

place," he said, “that’s first
place, everything else is frustra-
tion."

If Jim Banner’s track season is
to be judged by Richey’s criterion,

then it has been a frustrating‘

season for Banner and the rest of
his squad. The track team neither
won the IC4A’s nor did they do
better than last year in the na-
tionals.

It isn’t hard to visualize the
frustration an individual athlete
may suffer in a track meet or in
any other competitive sport, but,
when. a “whole” is’ evaluated,

- _ frustation should not be _con‘fused
‘ W p ‘ssgjth dissappointment. ’ /

,‘‘Whenever we don’t win every
event we enter, I’m disappoint-
ed,” said Banner earlier this
year. Even though Banner’s words
are optimistic, they are not feasi-
ble. If a team won everything ev-

erytime they tried what’s the pur-

pose for competition?

As the season 'began in the
Washington CYO meet, the Ban-
nermen did nothing spectacular.

But, as the season progressed, so
did the team. S ~

Let's not forget Richey, Smit-
tie Brown, Bryant Salter and the
relay teams.

In both the Kent State and Pitt
Invitational meets records were
eclipsed at a rapid pace. Often,
more than one record was broken
in one event. _ '

rose games, oneiof the-foremost‘

Because of NCAA regulations, a
major factor in football spring
drills is time, with each school’s
team allowed only 20 scheduled
meetings to prepare for the up-

. coming fall grid season.

In past seasons, Pitt football
coaches had to contend with the
time restrictions and the neces-
sary week break in practice for
final exams. "This year, Head
Coach Carl DePasqua became the
first grid mentor in recent years
to be freed from the need to split
the drills for finals.

The installation of Astro-Turf
in the Stadium enabled the Pan-
ther gridders to start three weeks
early and bypass the break in ac-
tion. Previously, weather condi-
tions hindered practices on the old
sod field.

“Before, we always broke-up
and then started again after fin-
als,” DePasqua stated. “We real-
ly didn't accomplish much then.
Now, we can analyze how we are
doing and see the progress we are
making.”

Although the players may not
relish practicing in the icy weath-
er now, DePasqua feels that the
experience gained will be bene-
ficial in the *fall when several
games may be played during cold
or inclement weather.

Until now,_ the coaching staff
has been emphasizing fundamen-
tals in the drills. “Right now, the
big objective is the placement of
the freshmen personnel,” contin-

--ued DePasqua. “They need an

awful lot of fundamental work
right now.”

Last year, DePasqua attempt-
ed to implement a triple option
into the Panther offense. Injuries
to the quarterbacks halted his
plans then, but he is presently in-
serting it into the attack.

Backfield Coach Bimbo Cec-
coni explained the Panther ver-
sion of the triple option. “We’re
working with two running backs,
unlike Texas who uses three,” he
said. “We rely on more finesse
while Texas has more power run-
nersf’

Presently, Cecconi has four
complete backfields to manuever
with.

“We’ll probably be down to
about two and a half after a few
scrimmages,” he continued. “It’s
normal for a few to get injured.”

Cecconi str_essed the necessity
for the _quarterbacks to become

“Right now they all understand
it, but they will all have to learn
to adapt to it. There are so many
things that the quarterbacks have
to learn for it.”

With over one-_third of the sched-

uled practices gone, thecoaches
have begun to switch some play-
ers to different positions.

athletes are concerned, it is un-
fortunate the team scores are rel-
atively unimportant. But you don’t

. No, tying asqthe second best
squad in the East and as the
eighth team in the country isn’t
frustrating. Not having done bet-

ter may be considered disappoint-V

ment. If that is the case, then
there are a lot of disappointed
teams around.

Next year Banner will have
most of his stars back. In the fall
he once again will begin preparing
for the NCAA’s. But, before the
fall comes. before the sometimes
frustrating and disappointing sea-

son is forgotten, the season on the

whole will be remembered. as a

good one. Banner’s'_ smile can at-

 After Wasting Time

by JAN FRY

. At the age of two Pitt‘s free-
. styler, Fred Lewis, accidently
. fell of a dock into a lake, almost
drowning, and it seems that ever
since he’s been falling into water.

Lastweek for example at the
Eastern Championships, Lewis
‘ broke two school records—the 400
IM in 4141.3 and the 1650 freestyle
in 18:18.3 minutes. When asked
how he felt about his triumpth.
‘ the recipient of a half tuition
swimming scholarship could only
reply," I saw that I could do much
i better. I swam a smart 1650 race

'-and think that next year everyone
P will be way below their times. "

‘ Before his swimming career
began, the native of Bristol Town-
I ship near Philadelphia had three

bad experiences in which he al-
most drowned, but that didn’t dis-
courage him. *-*~

In ninth grade he played soccer

played second behind a guy in soc-

cer that I thought wasn't as good
as I was. So when he was injured
and the coach finally decided to
put me in I decided to quit.”

And why did he start swimming
of all things? '

“I had a friend on the team and
he got me interested. One of the
main reasons that I liked swim-
ming was because it was one of
the things my Dad wasn't involved

H

in. (Mr. Lewis is a gymnastic

coach at Woodrow Wilson High in ‘
‘Bristol, Philadelphia.)

Lewis, a junior and a physical
education major, also comment-
ed that the individual competition
involved in the sport appealed to
him. “I had success with the
sport in high school -and so I de-
cided tocontinue with it.”

While attending Woodrow Wil-
son High Lewis swam “not very
well at all. “I am the jack of all
trades and the master of none.
When I swam I swam to take sec-
ond to score up points.”

Although he never qualified for
any state competitions, he did
swim two post season relay meets.

Two friends, Howard and Rich-
ard Norris, members of the Pitt
swim squad three years ago, got
him interested in Pitt. He wrote a
letter to Coach Bill Grant and ap-
plied in January.

“When I was accepted Coach
Grant wrote me a letter of con-
gratulations and welcome but I
really recruited Pitt myself," he
said. '

Has he been happy with the pro-
gram here at Pitt?

“I feel that I’ve wasted two and
one half years. However, things
are looking up. At the end of this
season under Coach Dick Brad-
shaw we’ve made up for what was
lost. He peaked us great and that’s
why we did so well at Easterns.

Next year Lewis believes ev-
eryone will be swimming withthe
right attitude. He feels that every-
one will “settle down and really
want to win." He believes that
with the support of the Athletic
Department and the new recruits,

“we’ll have one of our best seal *

sonsf'

In regard to his change in swim-
ming style since he has been here
at Pitt, the top freestyler remark-
ed, “I’ve given up my bad habits
and lately I’ve been training a lot
harder. In high school I never
loafed at practice and ‘until re-
cently I’ve been loafing." ’

During the summer Lewis works
out with the Philadelphia Aquatic
Club and coaches the Bucks Coun-
ty Park Recreation swim team.
He opes to coach swimming after
graduating.

.Lewis Looks For Better Showing

A THREE YEAR veteran of Pitt swimming, junior Fred Lewis looks to the
future of the swim team as a bright one. His two record-breaking races at
the Easterns is an indication of the upward trend.

I receive a fellowship as an assis-

tant coach at a college so as an
apprentice I could learn the finer

techniques involved in swimming."

North To Face Tough

Gannon Team In Erie

Pitt’s Ice Hockey Club goes into action tonight against Gannon Col-
lege in Erie in a 10 p.m. contest.

Team organizer and assistant coach Joe Testa is uncertain of the
Gannon squad’s ability but he anticipates a tough match.

“From the few scores that I do know about their games, they
should be a little better than us,”
he said. “They’re supposed to be
pretty good.”

Two skaters won’t be available
for the game. Glenn Hyde, who is
practicing with the varsity foot-
ball team, and Bill Glenville will
be unable to make the trip.

The next home game for the
club will be next Sunday night,
March 28. against the South Park
team.

Two final matches with Carne-
gie—Mellon’s club will conclude
the season’ for the highly success-
ful squad. Their present record
stands at 3-1-1 in the first year of
play for them.

JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

After being away from Pitt foot'— v

ball for 16 years, the Panthers’
’new_ defensive back coach Ralph
Jelic indicates that he’s glad to be

‘ _- home.

,“My parents live here and I
went to school here,” relates the
former Pitt grid-iron star. “But
my wife and kids are still in Bos-

 ton so -it makes it hard.”

 * ‘ Jelic has been around since he

-'-played for the Cat bowl teams of
: ‘"55 and ’56. Beginning his coach-
?- ’ing-career at Lehigh in 1961, he

years behind the ivy covered walls
of Harvard.

Rather than coming on with the
authoritarian style of
coaching, Jelic relies more on
establishing a rapport with the
athletes and having them react to
him as a person. His success is
impressive.

“I coached Bruce Taylor," com-
mented Jelic. Taylor is now play-
ing defensive back for the San
Francisco 49ers. “I also coached
Fred Barry, the Steelers defen-
sive back Reggie Rucker and four
boys thatmade all-East.”

Both the players and the new

Jelic into the Panther coaching
style.

“These kids have to learn the
things I’m doing,” said Jelic.
“Along with¥me adjusting to
them, we have to find each other
out. I have to find out how they
will respond to me.”

Being a defensive back coach,
Jelic is placed in a very difficult
position. He is faced with the
problem of breaking in new
sophomores to the Panther style.
Since Reggie Frye is the only re-
turning letterman with any back-
field experience the job becomes

tough defense and one that the
kids have trouble adjusting to.”

Jelic comes to Pitt after miss-
ing a shot at the head coaching job
at Harvard. With the retirement
of John Yovicsin, the Allegheny
County native became a candi-
date to fill the vacancy.

“All the players, their parents,
the managers, and other people
connected with the team support-
ed me.” related Jelic. “I made it
to the final round but when the
time came to pick the new coach

they wanted someone with head -_

coaching experience. ”

Comparing Pitt football to Ivy
League ball is really no compari-
son. “The big difference is the
quality of the athlete and the num-
ber of athletes,” said Jelic.

Jelic summed up his approach
to coaching like this: “I think the
players have to want to play for
you as an individual and as a
coach?’
