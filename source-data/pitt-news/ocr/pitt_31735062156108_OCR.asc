Council Clears
Fraternities of
Discrimination

By JOHN DeNINNO
Men’s Council, in a ' special
meeting Tuesday, unanimously
voted to “give a clean bill of health

to all undergraduate honorary,
professional, departmental, and

_ - recognition fraternities here at Pitt
‘since they do not have discrimi-

natory exclusion clauses in their
constitutions.” .

_ This resolution came as a result
of an investigation by Morton
Goldstein, vice-president ‘of MC,
who stated in his report that none
of the above fraternities have an
exclusion clause in their constitu-
tions. A

‘The social fraternities,” he said,
“are within the jurisdiction of IF
council and will be handled by IF
council.”

The special meeting was called
by Ronald Ecker, president of MC,
after_ Harvey Rabinowitz and
Goldstein had a verbal battle at
the regular meeting of MC over

For three ‘of the regulars—Fullback Bobby Epps, Left

upset. Thus injuries have thinned an already shallow squad

a mere one point.

7, Voytell Replaces Schmidt 
Since reserve Fullback,Joe Capp is already sidelined

with a back injury, Dawson is__sending Linebacker4Ray Fer-
guson into the fullback slot to back up Paul Chess. ,.

Ferguson’s defensive duties have fallen to -End Ken Voy-
tell, transfer from St. Bonaventure, who will work along-
side George Glagola and George Blanda in backing up the
line’, where Captain Schmidt’s absence will be felt.

_Although Epps willlprobably bee

in uniform, Dawson expressed ex-
treme doubt as to his chances of

playing. The burly fullback and’
- Hoffman are _suifering leg, injur-

. Dawson’s’ experiments with

.Henry Ford‘ at offensive halfback

seem ’to_ have progressed far
enough to indicate that the crack
safety man may do some ball-
carrying against the Cadets, be-
sides regular defensive chores. '
As for Coach Earl Blaik’s, sol-

diers, Dawson has enough reason
to fear them even without injur-
ie;

mer strength,” he said, “and they
are going to be tough, according
to our scouts.” .

Change in Opposition.

Tomorrow’s clash is the Pan-7
thers’ ﬁrst crack at an Eastern op— '

ponent this season, which will es-*

tablish their rating on a broader ‘

basis. . _
Although the earlier partrof the
schedule contained rugged west-
ern competition, which is partly
responsible "for Pitt’s - crippled
state, the Panthers’ performance
in those games is certain to keep

the Cadets on their toes.

that makes things seem like old times. The very old,times,
that is, when the Panthers were perenially looked on as a
power to be reckoned with. I . 1 »

’ A story on the sports pages of one of the downtown
papers Wednesday included the statement that New York
sports writers, in ﬁguring up the odds in the coming Pitt-
Army tussle decided that it wouldbe the making of the
-‘Army Mules -if they could knock -over the Panthersathis

bowl game the team is likely to qualify for. -

i ‘ ~ The student body- has responded to this initial suc-
cess of t-he team with a burst of enthusiasm the likes of.
which hasn’t been seen around here for a good while.
Monday’s‘action-packed celebration, was agood indication.
that school spirit, the lack of which was much deplored
last year, was‘there all the time, and just waiting for a
chance to express itself. And, while it would be silly to
try to minimize or condone the fact that sometimes things
got a little rough, on the whole,~Monday’s rally was a good

still alive and kicking lustily.

Finally, the large turnout for this Saturday’s game at
West Point is an indication of the certainty Panther rooters
feel tliat the team is on its way. The. latest word yester-
day was -that almost 200 bus trip tickets had been sold, just
short of enough to ﬁll six busses, and it was estimated
that another 800 were going to West Point on their own
hook, which will insure the team a respectable cheering
section at Michie Stadium. The whole thing adds up to‘
a pretty healthy state of affairs, which, we feel sure, can
only take a turn for the better.

Dear Editor.

I enjoyed and agreed with
your editorial on football games.
I think you are underestimating
the number of student tickets
that are. borrowed. I used to be,
the one to borrow them for the
Pitt News office and Owl oﬁice
and‘ I used to borrow and dis-
tribute at least twenty, every
week myself. All the old staff of
the News and the Owl would
want to come to the_ game but
since Pitt has not shown too
much in football" ability for some

time, their chief reason was to be
with the old crowd and get into
a good old gab-fest about when
Pitt might have a good ball team.
I would have come to every
game the year after I graduated‘
except that I knew that I would
not see ariyone I knew over on
the other side. The same with
the second year. The ﬁrst game
I attended was the ﬁrst game
this season and after three years
all my friends were over on the
other side» Try and keep that
one dollar idea going‘ and I can
assure you that the stadium will
be paid for twice as fast. If not
by lnon—Pitt friends ; of the stu-’
dents, it will 'be'paid by one or
»two-year Alumni. » ‘ "

Fo':- Those‘ With Hearing Troubles...

Clinic AttacksHearjng Problems

A great majority of U. S. citi-

zens are hard of hearing. Some’

‘of these. people are totally deaf
and others handicapped to such
an extent that they must seek
help in order to continue an or-
derly, useful life. ~

Thus the Eye and Ear Hos-
pital’s Department of Audiology

is set up to aid the people in this ’

area, who are stigmatized with a

severe hearing deﬁciency. _
Working closely with the Pitt

Speech department, the ‘ Audi-

' ology center has been correcting

and adjusting problems of deaf-
ness through a well-organized
educational program. Since 1948,
when a group of local ear special-
ists saw need for further aid in

: treating advanced problems of
, hearing, the aural "technicians

have helped over 3200 individ-
uals.

‘When a person .comes to the ,

_ Department of Audiology, it is

usually on the advice of his per-
, sonal physician or specialist.
Gets A Test-

-First, he is ‘given a hearing
test, to determine the approxi-
mate loss of hearing. If this test
proves that the trouble is caused
by some alien factor, such . as
mental disease, the‘ patient is di-
rected to the proper University
or City agency. '

__ If there is no such complica-

tion, a hearing aid evaluation is
made, in which the patient tries
on various aids until the one best
suited to his needs is found;

In the cases of those whom
aids cannot beneﬁt, aural re-
habilitation, including lip read-
ing, is applied.

With children, who number

about half of the Department’s

visitors, the same processes are

used. For some children, who
have been discovered deaf before

they could talk, education for‘

_ speech, including preparation for
lip reading, trains them, to realize
the existance of oral communi-
cation. ‘

An Educational Unit

“We are not a medical unit,
but an educational one, helping
the patient and those around him
adjust to the situation,” says
Miss Charlotte Avery, audiology
technician and lecturer.

Proof of the adjustment em-
phasis is seen in the Department’s
work with people who have had

Italian Schiolarshnip 

Student Delighted

M/ith Life Here’

By JOAN THOMAS

“The. idea of a Gothic skyscraper horriﬁed me,” admit- . “
ted Fernando Invrea, an Italian teacher of history and lit- ,

erature, who was granted a scholarship to study her special-

ized subjects at Pitt this year.

But now the “huge skyscraper?
no "longer startles her and has
become a second home to the
young Italian miss, who came to
America with seven other schol-
arship winners on the S.S. “Nul—
cania.”

The “Nulcania” docked at New
York and Fernando ‘remained
there for three days before com-
ing to Pittsburgh. She boasts of
exploring the Statue of Liberty
and the Empireistate building.

“I\even saw South Paciﬁc!” she
exclaimed * proudly.

. Mixed Ancestry

Fernando, a light blonde with
hazel eyes, claims to be the dark-

est of eight children in her Ital-

ian family. “My ancestorsgare
Scotch, Polish, French, -German,
and Dutch,” she explained.

"‘I must admit I have more
social life at Pitt,” continued
the pretty, young ‘teacher. She
explained, however, that class-
es during the war were held
in a bomb "shelter. Many times

‘she -took’ oral exams in a shel- V

ter with enemy planes circling
over the city.

Concerning American coffee,
she was blunt and emphatic. “I
loathe it!” . --

Besides not ﬁnding her good
“cafe,” Fernando thinks that
American _food is “too much
cooked.” She doesn’t like stewed
peaches and prunes.

Not Biased

The history major was thrilled
with the Nationality Rooms. But

   

Fernando Invrea
“They’re. all so nice”

she was not partial_to the Italian
Room. “They are all so nice!”
“And American” cars are so
nice and gay,” Miss Invrea
blurted happily. “I love them
so much.” 0
She compared them ‘with the
much lighter Italian “Topoli-
na’s~."’ “This is the Italian name
for Mickey Mouse, who is small
and quick,” she said.
Fernando likes our country and .
feels very much at home here.
“But,” she confessed wistfully,

“at times I get so homesick! I do
love Italy so.” ‘

Being Groomed by Petra
By CARROLL COOK

Joseph ‘Glen’ Tunning from Massilon, O. has never
played on a losing football team-and he does not plan

to begin here at Pitt.

“We "lost only three" games in
five years while I played at Mas-
silon,” -he’ recalls, “but we were
still-state champs for the past
three years“, ' I I

Tunning, a 240-pound. guard,
graduated last June,. is one of
three gridders to enroll here from
Massilon. The other two are Guard
Rudy Grunder and Halfback Bob
Grier.

‘,Had Many Offers

Glen, an honor student in high
school, plans to major in physical
education. He first became inter-
ested in Pitt when he visited here
last fall to watch the Pitt—Penn
State game at the Stadium. He al-
so looked over the’ campus last
spring.

But Pitt wasn’t the only school
that wanted Tunning.. In fact,
“many scl1oo1s,”A Tunning admits,
offered me more than Pitt did.
I picked Pitt, though, for several
reasons. I

I was impressed with the friend-
liness of the football players. At

“If you happen to get injured
while playing at Pitt, they don’t'
take your scholarship away,’.’
Glen said. ’

Freshman Coach Steve Petro,
who wasbconsidered one of Pitt's
great guards at only 185 pounds
is quite a contrast to the 240-
pound t"reshman. “He likes to play

rough," Petro observed. “Natur—'

guards need‘ but come next spring
he’ll be a candidate for the var-

, It’s Chess’ move against the Black Knights tomorrow
afternoon. This, after two years of occupying a comfort-
able spot on the bench, rising only occassionally to ﬁll in
for.Bobby Epps.‘ I ' ' . .
_ Coach Red -Dawson, after losing his valuable hard—driv-
ing AFu1lback_Ep’ps through a leg. injury ‘suffered in the
Notre Dame game, has-named Paul Chess to ﬁll in and carry
_ a portion of the load. The move.
I shifts attention to the blond senior
and’ recalls more pleasant days
vwhen Chess was the Pride of
Spring Drills, 1950.

At that tirne,/Chess was a
hard—hitting fullback, too. In
fact, his performances were sen-
.sationa_l. On the ﬁnal day of drills
he only scored three touchdowns
—one a shifty 65-yard return of
a punt. ‘ '

Head Coach Len Casano-
va, who roomed here just one
year, was proud of his newly-~
found back for he, ‘too, had,
played the game of chess.
Cas moved the ex-Meadville
High athlete from an end po-'
sition into the backﬁeld-.

But what happened between 1950 and 1952? Well, the Marine

the campus last fall football was mere child’s play to a veteran

show signs of two_ years ago when he turned State’s end for the
winning touchdown. 4
Tomorrow he gets the _ﬁna1 chance of his college grid career.
Dawson, pleased with Chess’ new mental approach, com-
mented on the affair. “Pau1’s attitude has changed I under-
stand,” he said. They tell me it wasn’t so good last year.”
_Above all, Dawson also pointed out that “he’s learned ‘to run
inside, and you know he could always go around the end.” He
gets his chance to do both against Army.
