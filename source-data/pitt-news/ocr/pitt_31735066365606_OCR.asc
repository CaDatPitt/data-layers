Commuters get   spaces t
in Trees Hall lot i t

. by RICK EULER

Today. University commuters
were given an additional 400 park-
ing spaces. as the Trees Hall
Parking Lot opened.

The lot. located next. to Trees
‘Hall. is paved. lighted. enclosed
by a chain link fence. and has a

.53.. guard on duty from approximately

- _ per space daily. By using the rate - ..
 system..ho_wever. wehope to han-

._,'

 

7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Four hun-
dred of its 470 spaces are avail-
able for student use.

According to Ed Goralczyk._
vice-president of the Com.1iuter
Association (CA). parking in the
lot will cost 50 cents daily. Hates
for special events held on class
days will be the same. but it is ex’-
pected that rates over the week-
end will be $1.

Lud' Hanczar, chairman of the
CA’s Parking Committee, explain-
ed that the lot will be operated on
a daily rate basis to avoid the
sticker system used elsewhere.

"We avoided using the sticker
system." said Hanczai‘. "because
we wanted to utilize the available
space as much as possible. With
a sticker system we would be un-
able to admit more than one car

die a daily turnover of one-and-
one-half to two cars per space
each day. This means an addition-
al 200 to 400 cars will be able to
use the lot daily."

Originally. the CA had hoped
for a lot on the site of the Trees
Practice Field across from Pitt

Stadium. It was thwarted in its ef-‘

forts. however. when the City
Planning Commission decided that
such a lot would create a bottle-
neck for traffic.

At a loss over what to do next,
the CA was somewhat surprised
when in March, 1971, the adminis-
tration proposed to construct a
lot on the site of the cemetery
next‘to~Trees Hall.

"Never in our wildest dreams
would'we have considered propos-
ing tearing up a cemetery for a
parking lot." said (joralczyk.
When the administration propos-
ed the lot. however. the CA readi-
ly agreed. because of an acute
parking shortage.

According to Hanczar. this un-
expected move by the administra-

- tion resulted from the adminis-

tration's realization of the park-
ing problem, sudden interest in

lW0nl(tll ’'overlooked’’ in jobs

Pitt charged with sex biases

by EVAN PAT’I‘AK
Associate Editor

A woman who for more than
a year unsuccessfully sought
employment at the University
has charged the school with
discrimination against women
in non—faculty positions.

Virginia Jackson said that
though she "attempted to apply
for every job I ‘thought I was
capable of doing" since Septem-
ber. 1970. she had been given
only "the formal run-around."

“Because I was a woman,”
she said, “I think they over-
looked me. I‘ don’t think they
were out to get me.”

District Court as a class-action

charged the Church with "si-
lence in the face of tremendous
evidence of criminality.“

In an address here" sponsored
by various Catholic organiza-
tions of the Pittsburgh area.
McAlister accused the Church of
condoning the laws of a crimin-
al state by "lending the weight
of its moral authority to the gov-

-ernment.”— "

“In exchange,” she said, “the
church receives tax exemptions,
dispensations for the clergy from
military duty, and places at ban-
quets.”’ ‘ 7’ '

McAlister cited the My‘ Lai
massacre, the Pentagon Papers.
and the continuation of the Viet-
nam war as issues of conscience

Church in social issues. McAlis-

with the criminal _records pre-

Though only three presiden-
tial and nine board petitions
have been picked up by pro-
spective candidates, Student
Government Elections Commit-
tee chairman Arnie Steinberg

denied that ‘this ~ indicated
apathy toward this year’s elec-
tions. \

“In the past. we have had
about 25 people" running who
were only partially interested
in working in student govern-
ment." said Steinberg.” This
year. ,_although we have fewer
people running.’ these are the
hard-core. interested and qual-
ity people.” “‘

Steinberg reported that some
candidates resented the strin-
gent elections code. . ’

“Most of them argue that the
code will cut down on their
campaigning,” he said., ’

The official campaign ‘for
the January 19 election begins
Wednesday. with the announce-
the eligible candi-
dates‘ in the Pitt News. The
elections code on‘the campaign-
ing limits circulating material.

An amendment requiring Frank-

special arrangements to seat Pitt

"have two lines. one for Pitt stu-

dents. Then they can check IDs
and seat Pitt kids first.

Klavonic added, “I think there

i._;I" Mike Haley’s column in the
December issue of the Pitt

_ News advocated that the facul-
k’ ty of the College refuse to
adopt Black Studies as an un-
dergraduate major on the
 grounds that Black Studies does
7 not ‘completely qualify as an

,academic discipline and that a
Black Studies major would
7 serve to further isolate Blacks
aandwhites within the Univer-
., hf-I sity community.

,Haley’s view seems both a
4_  narrow view of what consti-
 'tutes,-an academic discipline
" and a‘ rather naive perception
 .of, the existing racial situation
 in this country. Black Studies

qualifies as an academic dis-

 Incredibly enough, the University is under no -legal

plums.

Other senators attempt to be conscientious about the
awards. They make an effort to award the scholarships
to students with financial need.:

Senator Thomas Lamb guesses that approximately 95
percent of senatorial scholarships “are awarded to families
that need them.”

Many will question the Senator’s estimate.

Besides. the point is that some families need aid more
than others. and senators are ill equipped to function as
certified public accountants. The Pennsylvania Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agendy has a sophisticated apparatus
fordetermining degrees of financial need: senators are
capable only of crude hunches.

Several high-ranking Pitt administrators privately con-
demn senatorial scholarships. but they refuse to do more
than whisper their outrage. ‘

Were the University to abolish senatorial scholarships.
the off-the—record critics argue._ there would be repercus-
sions in Harrisburg. In short. these administrators believe
many state legislators would react vindictively to a cancel-
lation of the scholarships andwould engage in reprisals

the scholarships are political

' against the University.

The fears of one administrator are typical: “I’m hesi-
tant to have the University stick its neck out and have the
Legislature lower the boom,” he confided. , _

Specifically. administrators worrythat the State Legis-
lature might reduce appropriations to the University. if

Black Studies is necessarily

Senator'Lamb. who happens to favor senatorial schol-
arships. disagrees with this gloomy forecast. Asked if the
abolition of the scholarships by a university would lead to
reprisals by the State Legislature. Lamb said. “I don’t think
so.” Noting that several state senators are opposed to sena-
torial scholarships and that the state house voted to abolish
senatorial scholarships several years ago. Lamb predicted
a "mixed reaction" to such a move.
The Pitt News believes the administration has gross-
ly exaggerated repercussions in Harrisburg should senator-
ial scholarships be abolished.
.\Ioreoyer..since the University is not legally obli-
gated to dispense senatorial scholarships. the University
must bear responsibility for the perpetuation of the prac-

The Pitt News strongly urges Chancellor Posyar
to eliminate new senatorial scholarships from the budget
which will be presented to the State Legislature in Majch Q;
or April. » , 7 ii“

iY’s expand programs,
explore social issues

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

-The Pitt YWCA and YMCA are inaugurating the term with some
additions to their already established programs.

-. ’.A relatively new force at the University, the YWCA is presenting
-"Student Hour for Issues" in the Supper Room of the Student Union‘ ev-
 ery other Wednesday from 12 noon to 2 p.m.. starting date to be an-
. ﬁnounced. -

Based on student proposals, the seminars will deal with areas of
interest in the Oakland community, expressed by students."

_i;__ican be a “kickoff program to something bigger.”

 The purpose of the YWCA on campus, said Christian. is to "pro-
vide someone to develop programs students want . . . it could be politi-
cal in nature and it could include social reform.“ '

. She said primary concerns of the.YWCA are first, the elimination
. _ of racism, and second, the women’s rights movement.

 A preliminary meeting will be held tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in the
3.’-¥';',,_Supper Room of the Student Union. Anyone who has an idea or a con-
cept that might be discussed at a‘ “Student Hour” is invited to attend.

Martha Schlamme is Eleanor
of Acquitaine. King Henry ll‘s
fier_v queen. in the current produc-
tion of James Goldman‘s The Lion
in Winter at the Pittsburgh Play-
house. My spontaneous comments
at meeting Schlamme at the con-
clusion of her performance were
"beautiful . . . moving . . . a mar-
velous portrayal.“

Her repl_v. in a rich and delight-
ful Viennese accent was “ .
thank you . . . but if only another
week of rehearsal. .. 

Schlammes modesty is admir-
able. She did, however‘, achieve
brilliance on opening night when
she delivered one of the most sen-

sitive and accurate portrayals of

this year's theatre season in Pitts-
burgh.’

Her exquisite movement and
delivery, coupled with accurate
shifts of mood and emotion, blend-
ed for a rich and powerful per-
formance. It is in large part her
presence that elevates -Goldman’s
drama from that of “most pleas-
ing”» to that of “a most moving
and enjoyable evening in theatre.”

The Lion in Winter is a mildly
historical comedy drama. It does
retain enough of an historical base
in history so,that its author has
been able to build an interesting

’ inter-play on Henry II’s devastat-

ing household.

The play is filled with devious
plots and develish schemes of a
king, his queen, and their three
sonsglts theme involves the fam-
ily conflicts over the inheritance

of Henry’s crown and the state’ of‘
Henry and Eleanor’s fascinating

\l.'.$ﬂlIn~r.1‘

  
  

relationship as husband and

’ wife. It places special emphasis

upon the amusement and horror
of the personalities who play out
Goldman’s tale.

Although it succeeds in being
entertaining, it is far more so be-
cause of thetalents of Schlamme,
a fine cast, and wit of Goldman’s
dialogue rather than the dramatic
relevance of the story itself. It is
much more a story of the rela-
tionship of Henry and Eleanor and
far too much only a caricature
when dealing with the rest of the
family. _

Its depth grows shallow when
viewing the total household, leav-
ing much of the emotional inter-
change between parents and sons
to just superficial struggle.

Earl Boen plays a delightful
Henry II. His style is accurate
and effective in creating and cun-
ning and masterful king of Eng-
land. He works well with Schlam-
me on stage; they are comple men-_
tary.

Alan Clarey’s Geoffrey is an
excellent portrayal—it is Clarey
at one of his finest moments. Dan-
~iel Mooney (Ri-chard" " Lionheart)
is quite fine in, his portrayal of the
eldest and most powerful of Hen-
ry’s sons.

. Jennifer Wells, as the‘French
princess and Henry’s “second
love” is far too inconsistent in her

role. Only in the latter half of the

play does ‘she “get into her char-
acter.” For most of the first act

sheiappears merely to be search-
ing for an aura; of innocence and
that takes a long time coming.

Pitt News Drama Critic

 

David Novich. John. is a little
overdone with boyishness as the

youngest son. His performance,

although of mote. is a bit too
childish to warrant his father‘s
great affection. John must have
maintained some stable moments.

David Emge (Philip, King of‘

France) plays an exquisite Phil-
ip. His interpretation , of the
shrewd “boy-king” is well-bal-
anced and consistent and is a ma-
jor contribution to the success of

- this production. David, aresident

Equity actor of the Playhouse
Company, has appeared in every
production of the Playhouse’s

current season. Although each of.

his performances has been signi-
ficant, they have at the same time
been in less than meaty roles_..

It is hoped we can look forward
to the Playhouses future utiliza-

tion of such a valuable asset to its "

acting company.

Direction by John David Lutz is J I

only adequate. There is nothing
really exciting here. Blocking in

some places is awkward, and in"

most other instances less than
imaginative. Although the play is
intact. its more demanding mo-

ments are played down by a less- _

than-inspired directing effort,
coupled with Mary Ellen Kenne-
dy’s usually functionally , attrac-

tive, but unmoving set. The show

is, in essence, visually flat and
"boxy" where the directors lack
of dimension for Goldman's multi-
faceted drama is most evident.

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

A The Young Men and Women’s Hebrew Association Music Society
 has prided itself for some time in its overwhelming success in attract-
 ~ ing the best in international musical talent to its recital series.

, Not wishing to ignore local talent. the society auditions such tal-
7'ent annually in its Passamaneck Auditions with many satisfactory re-
1 sults. This season's results were revealed this past week as Mary Ann
. _ Doody. soprano. and Jacob ‘Naveh. violinist. who presented their public
- -performances as audition winners.

. Naveh displayed his skills via 18th and 19th century repertoire with
A interpretations of Handel, Mozart, and Saint-Saens. Although he show-
" éd. skill, his intonation in the upper "register proved quite shaky (es-
pecially his E string). _
His rendition of the Saint-Saens‘ Introduction and Rondo Capric-
, cioso, one of the most ‘dazzling showpieces for the concert violinist.
O ' w_as somewhat lackluster. but his feeling for the Mozart sonata showed
a_ greater amount of thought.

‘While Naveh showed himself fairly competent with the 18th and

19th century. Doody concentrated upon the 20th century repertoire.
"5 With the exception of an aria from Don Giovanni, she performed mod-
l __ ern songs of Poulenc. Milhaud.,Barber. and Berg.

Her renditions were marvelous—superior to anything she has pre-
-viously done this season. This is certainly all the more amazing, es-'
pecially since she was captive to throes of the flu that very evening. _

A A great devotion to proper execution and expression as far as the
, ‘texts-of her selections were concerned convinced many of us that she
_ is indeed a woman close to her art. Atlhough visibly‘ nervous at times.
-'  her grace and attitude on stage were indeed commendable.

She brought tenderness to Poulenc. charm to .\/Iilhaud. drama to
-(Barber. and lyricism to Berg.«Each selection was a worthy Prieslied in
O ' itself.“ and it is ea_sy to understand her triumph in this competition. Her
_ ’ ovation followed the concert was enthusiastic indeed and it is likely to
' ' remain so in future concerts as well.

 cliff hanger

°°$” worth your money 

by CINDY MORGAN
Entertainment Editor

Dollars, director Robert Brooks‘
latest release. comes across
much like a made-for-television
movie. yet still adeptly combines
the lightness of comedy with a
Mission: Impossible tension.

Joe Collins (Warren Beatty) ‘is

a suave. fast-talking bank execu-
tive in charge of security at

"Swiss Bank" in Germany. Befit-2

ting his p0slti0n.,he installs an
endless variety of modern secur-
ity gadgets. especially in the vault

that contains the bank's safety.

deposit boxes.

Only one man.—himself_—could
possibly create a’ plan that could
crack through to the bank‘s al-
most impenetrable depths.

' Only one woman, Dawn Divine
(Goldie Hawn) has enough ‘‘con-

2 tacts’-’ to be chosen as accomplice

in‘ his scheme to rob three boxes
belonging to three crooks: an
army officer, ' an international
drug peddler, and a black market
businessman.

‘What do these three men have
in common with Dawn‘? (No. she

isn‘t a secretary or bank teller).
Each is a "customer" and
through a well-placed tape record-
er and a little conniving on her
part. she manages to get enough
information to insure Collin’s suc-
cess. -

Brooks has created a well-paced
film. a- cliff hanger to the end.
showing violence through comedy.
and comedy in violence. And in-
stead of cramming all his little
surprises into one segment. he
allows one to follow another. keep-
ing viewers‘ concentration on the
screen instead of on the writing
on their candy bar wrappers.

A Beatty is surprisingly comfort-
able with the character of Joe
Collins, handling the role with
strong dashes of cool, _secret-
agent detachment and plain com-

' H1011 sense.

The most important feature in a
successful million dollar heist is
not in split-second timing. he con-
cludes. but in the fact that one
should burglarize thieves since
they couldn‘t call the police to
retrieve money that wasn’t theirs
in the first place.

Hawn is perfect as a giggly hook-
er paid $200 a night for romping
around her apartment. One client.
for example. demands that she
dress in a fireman’s suit and
bright red hat and chase him from ’
room to room. To conclude her
evenings work. she douses him
with healthy sprays of seltzer.

The role, in many ways, is an
extension of ‘the character she
created on Laugh-In. although in
several instances she is called
upon to present a serious side to
Dawn Divine. (These are not ex-
actly her strongest moments on
film.) "

If you like suspense spiced with
comedy. then Dollars does it with- '
out a lot of unneccessary gore. 
and without a lot of comedy work-
ed into the wrong places. Don't be

You figure that of all the prod
ucts available, some might sound
wonderful, some mediocre, and some
terrible. Some will prove to be ulti-
mately reliable, and others will more
or less quickly disintegrate.
Clearly you want a music sys-
tem which will be both wonderful (so
you will be happy) and ultimately

' reliable,(so you and your investment

will be secure).

We can help you; please read
on.

We describe a four-hundred dol-
lar component system which repre-
sents more value and reliability than
has previously been available. (A
year ago it would have been neces-
sary to spend at least six hundred
dollars to bring home this amount of
performance.) Two new products
make this system possible: the new
Smaller Advent Loudspeakers and
the new Marantz 2215 stereo receiver.

The Smaller Advent Loudspeak-

'4

 

5'.’ o

ers are just I_ike the original Advent
Loudspeakers in every quantifiable
and audible respect, except that they
are smaller, less expensive and
won't play as loud. This means that
on most kinds ‘of musical material,
and under most listening conditions
likely to apply in most homes,~the
Smaller Advent Loudspeaker is the
equal of any loudspeaker system
available at any price. , _

The Smaller Advent is the only
speaker under one hundred dollars

‘ which can reproduce the ‘lowest

tones of a pipe organ and the high-
est sounds of a cymbal (if they art:
on the record!), which maintains a
satisfying tonal balance on almost
all source material.

The Marantz 2215 thatwe are
recommending provides more than
enough power to satisfy both you
and the Advents: it delivers forty
watts RMS into four ohms, across
the entire audio range, at less than

0.5% total distortion. (RMS, or con-

tinuous power, isthe most demand-

) range performance, they will
together cleanly reproduce any
distortion, rumble, wow, or flut-
ter that is contributed by a less
than excellent turntable/
cartridge combination. We

therefore recommend the BSR 

31OX automatic turntable with a
Shure M75 cartridge. The 31OX has
a good heavy platter, .a smooth and
gentle changingmechanism, and a
convenient cueing control. The
Shure cartridge reproduces the full
audio range with exceptional clarity;
it therefore complements the very
wide-range capabilities of the
Marantz receiver and the Advent

"loudspeakers.

The system price is $395.00. All

components are guaranteed for two

years, parts and labor. There are no
little options to surprise you. Only
good sound and sheer product value
for your dollars. We of Opus One
consider this system to be the most
significant new value in stereo in
the last 6 years.

IIllIIIlllllllllllllllllllllllIIIlllllllllmllllmlllllllllllllllg
IIIIIIIIIIIIllIllllIlllllllllllllIllllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllll _

on the floor of the Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena I watched a charged —

up Duquesne squad humiliate the Pitt Panthers before 10,000
screaming fans. Part of the agony the Cat fans felt that night
must have turned to dispair as they witnessed the explosion of
another well-fashioned myth. Once again a
Pitt squad was floundering inmediocrity.

Charting the course of Pitt’s basketball season to date is
similar to maping the ups and downs of a roller coaster ride-
——although the valleys are deeper and the hills far from thrill-
ingly high. The Panther victories have been unimpressive and
theirlosses. if understandable. are far from expected.

Every successful season features victories over a number
of mediocre-to-poor schools. placed on theschedule in a effort
to beef up the squad’s record. Pitt has dominated such oppon-
ents as Westminster, Ohio Wesleyan, and George Washington.’
while they did workmanlike jobs on Gettysburg and Navy. But
everyone of these schools the Panthers were expected to down.

The other side of the_ coin is more significant. Understand-
ably, no team goes around knocking off schools like South Caro-
lina or North Carolina'regularly. A squad is also expected to

"have trouble with opponents in the “always tough” category

like Wisconsin and Rutgers. But upsets do happen and for a
tournament-bound team they’ re almost expected.

When Pitt came out on the court December 4 and...proceeded= »
- to ride the North Carolina Tarheels for 30minutes, all the pre-

season optimism seemed justified. Since then things’ have failed

to progress. Where the failure-lies can be detected in the evolu- V

tion of a good teamto a supposedly great one.

Finishing 14-10 one year ago (only
after losingtheir last three contests)

play together, play well, and win ball
games. It appeared that all they need-
ed was one outstanding performer to’

squad in order to send them into a post-
season tourney. 1

The outstanding player has appear-
ed, but the well-oiled squad has devel-
oped some rusty joints. Bill Knight has

begun to‘prove himself to be the highly KNIGHT

touted, All-American calibre ballplayer that everyone expected-

him to be‘. But how much his great ability has helped the Pan-
thers is questionable. ~ '

Admittedly, the Cats are doing some things differently this
year to accomodate Knight, but basically they are the same ball
club. The addition of Knight and the return of Cleve Edwards
should more then compenstate for the loss of- Bill Downes
through graduation and Buzzy Harrison through eligibility. But
it hasn’t. ’ . ‘ ‘ ,

Part of the answer lies in the fact that Knight has become
focus of" the Panther offense and the otheriplayers on the court
seem to be looking to him to take the shots. This has hurt the
team’s effort as Coach Fran Webster pointed out.

_ “Billy will get all the shots he wants in thenormal course
of the game,” ‘commented Webster after Satur’day’s victory
over Westminster. “But if the rest of the team looks for him
it’s not good.” ’ '

It’s only been recently that Kent Scott has regained the
form he showed all last year, turning in back-to-back 21 point
performances against Rutgers and Westminster to compliment
Knight. In the first few games Mike Paul picked up the slack‘.
but one, two, or even three ‘players does not make up a squad
and certainly not a winning one.

In addition to the pressure on Knight to score points, he has

1 also‘ been forced to control the backboards for the Panthers.

Because of the lack of help he’s been getting in the rebounding
department. Pitt has failed to get many of the easy baskets that

_help ‘win ball games. The slow start of Paul O’Gorek may be

symptomatic of the deficit.

I “Right now. we have four players working for the same
position, O’Gorek, Jones, Sulkowski, and Morris,” said Head
Coach Buzz Ridl. “And right now no one has stood out.”

Ridl was referring to a position that O’Gorek held securely ’

one year ago and has failed to regain today. Morris has not
shown the promise he exhibited as a freshman and Sulkowski
has hardly had an opportunity to break into the starting line-up.
Ridl did mention that he is especially pleased with the perform:

ance of Jones. _ .

In addition to the lack of a big man. Ridlalso admits that
Cleve Edwards has-just started to regain the form he showed in
’70. Ten games is certainly an expensive sharpener.

wvu I‘iS

against erratic cagersi

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

A big difference in tonight's
game between rival West Vir-
ginia and the Panthers may be
the two players that the Moun-
taineers recently lost.

Levi Phillips and Larry Har-
ris. two starters declared aca-
demically ineligible last week.
represent the only losses that
the Mountaineers experienced
this season. however. The WVU
squad enters the 8 p.m. tipoff
at the Field House with a 6-0
record. A near capacity crowd
is expected.

‘Both Phillips and Harris play-
ed key roles in the Mountain-
eer’s two victories over the
Panthers last year. In fact.
Harris scored the winning bas-
ket in the 66-64 last second win
by WVU.

Until" their disqualification,
the duo, was averaging a com-

bined 25 points. Phillips led
the Mountaineers in- assists,
—while Harris was the third,

leading rebounder on the team.

Despite the absence of the
pair on Saturday night. ,the

Mountaineersicame from behind —

in the second half to whip Dav-
idson 95-78. ‘

Leading the WVU high scor-

‘ ing offense is Wil‘ Robinson. an
‘All-American

‘candidate- He
poured in 38 points against Da-
vidson to increase his scoring
average to 27 points per game. . ,
Robinson has a deadly jump
shot from anywhere on the

court and is also a fine re-

bounder and ball handler.

-Leading the Mountaineers on
the boards is _6-5 senior -Sam
Ogelsby. With Phillips’ now
departed._ Ogelsby assumes the
second spot» in the scoring
parade with a 12 point aver-
age. '

Overall. the squad maintains
a lofty 93 point per game
clip. while limiting the oppo-

I sition to just 75 points.

In addition to the CWVU win
-over Davidson, other victims
of the squad have been East
Carolina, ‘California at Irvine,
North Carolina State, Columbia,
and Northwestern.

Tonight’s game will be the
first one on" the road for the
Mounties. All six of their games

have ‘been’ played at WVU’s -

year old Coliseum.

Panther Coach Buzz Ridl
realizes that WVU will be a
tough foe for his erratic Pan-
thers.
(Harris and Phillips) they’ll
be tough.” he commented after
Saturday’s win over Westmin-
ster. "They are a goodshooting
team."}" ' .

The tallest man on the Moun-
taineers’ squad is Mike Heitz, a
7-0 senior. However, Heitz lacks
agility and’ quickness ‘around
the basket, and is not much of a
scoring threat..

Forward Dave Werthman will
probably also be in the starting
lineup tonight. The 6-7 senior
was a member of the Robert
Morris Junior College team
before transferring to WVU and
has given the Mounties added

The Springfield College gym-
nasts easily defeated the Pitt
gymnastic squad. l52.25—1l5.95
in a one-sided meet Friday night
at Trees Hall.

Springfield had a well-balanc-
ed team. led by its all-around

performers Dennis Thompson.
Sal Scuderi. and Jack Avona.
These three contestants each

scored over 42 points in the‘
meet and combined for over 137
of Springfield’s point total.

Thompson scored 8.8 or

more in four events. taking indi-
vidual honors in each. The four
events were the floor exercise

(8.8). vaulting (8.9). the parallel
bars (8.85) and the horizontal
bar (8.8).

Although his team has been a
perennial contender for Eastern
gymnastic supremacy, Spring-
field Coach Frank Wolcott, had
been pessimistic about his
squad’s future this season. After
Springfield smashed the Pan-
thers, he was no longer so con-
cerned. ’

Wolcott said. “Thompson.
Scuderi. and Avona all perform-
ed better than I expected. It
was a very pleasant surprise."

Coach Wolcott was upset
over a rather severe injury
sustained by his All-American

M gymnast Rick Martin (horizont-

al bar), but Junior Tony Man-
zella took up the slack with an
8.6in that event. .

Having scored in the l20’s
against West Point, the Pitt
gymnasts looked flat against

Springfield and showed a lack

‘of spirit. Coach Warren Neiger’s

gymnasts sat in complete si-
lence throughout the match,
while Springfield’s bench rever-
berated with applause and
team chatter.

Despite Pitt’s dismal perfor-
mance. there were some bright
moments. Mike Gracik. who
totaled 23 points in three dif-
ferent eventsfscored an 8.7 on
the sidehorse. Except for a bad
dismount. Gracik could easily
have reached a 9.2.

Commenting on Gracik‘s side-
horse exhibition. one of
judges remarked. "Gracik gave
a brilliant performance. Were it
not for the dismount problem.
it would have been flawless. 

Panther Dick Pribis earned
the highest individual Pitt score
with an 8.8 in the longhorse
vault. Like the rest of his team-

_ mates, Pribis’ performance was
subp'ar, and far below his Army

point total.

this Saturday at Slippery Rock.
