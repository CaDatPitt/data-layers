Meager attendance
beneﬁcial at SGB Town Meeting

—ByBethKovaly

Asst; News Editor

Student Government Board ’
members were ready to debate with
Pitt students at yesterday’s Town
Meeting. ‘

The problem was, only two stu-
dents showed up.

SGB scheduled the old—fashioned
town meeting several weeks ago.

Though the date was changed
once, ﬂiers announcing yesterdays
meet were posted around campus
and ads appeared in The Pitt News.

The board members were disap-
pointed with the turnout.

“I” hear students complaining
about student government,”
President Jacob Brody said.

- “Well, hey — where the hell are
you’ Come in here and we’ll talk
about it Otherwise, you’re making
misinfomted judgements.”

"There are no excuses,” member
Brian Bolton said. “If people want
to be informed, they should come
to the meetings.”

The board members continued to
blast" student apathy. '

Richard Koval, CA8

major also earning a

He’s out on the great
job hunt, but he’s not
worried about finding

“If I’m patient, I’ll
find something,” Koval I
said. “I’ll get into a
company after school
and be loyal as I can,
but if the company isn’t
large enough, I’ll
move.”

He may use his first
job as a stepping stone
to a job he really wants. ‘
“I’l1 look for a job when
I have one °I’ll get

Koval’s attitude
toward the job hunt
isn’t unusual, according

Pitt athletics is out of line with Title IX

ByGeorge_Klimis

Staﬁ“Writer

(Editors note: Yhis is the second part
of a ttLo—part series.)

Gender equity, . a university’s
responsibility to offer as many athletic
opportunities for women as it does for
men, is a struggle not at all conﬁned to
the University of Pittsburgh.

Some athletes, when faced with this
inequity, take action.

Jon Pushinski is a lawyer who suc-
cessfully frled suit for four female stu-
dent athletes from Indiana University
of Pennsylvania to regain their field
hockey and gymnastics teams. Upon
observation, he found Pitt’s numbers
out of line with Title IX

Last year, Dawn Favia, Wendy
Schandelmeier, Kim Dalcamo and

’Amy Phaehler went to federal court
after IUP cancelled its ﬁeld hockey

program, of which they were mem-

bers. Pushinski, along with fourother
lawyers, used Title IX as the key argu-
ment to win their case on gender equi-

‘ e went straight to court instead of
[the Oﬂice of Civil Rights] because the
results are much quicker,” Pushinski
said.

“If [Pitt has] only 23 percent [females]

participating and 49 percent of the stu-

dents are women, then they have a seri-
ous problem there,” Pushinski said.
“The amount of opportunities of
women athletics should be proportion-
ate to the amount of women under-
graduate students.” v

Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes argued
that Pitt’s 112—member football program
causes a major gender imbalance. But
minus football, men still make up over
twice as many participants as women,
206 to 96.

Pushinski points out that football could
be balanced by adding sports or
increasing women’s participation. For
example, Pushinski said that having
women’s bowling, swimming and golf
teams could compensate the number of
athletes involved in football.

T)on't get stressed preparing for finals

re your ways of coping
with stress ineffective?
More importantly, are you
feeling more stressed
because finals are near?
Finally, do you want to learn
how to cope with stress and
survive finals? The Finals
Week Survival Workshop is
designed for you.

In preparation for finals,
you need to study an accu-
mulation of 14 weeks of
notes and reading assign-
ments. This includes priori-
tizing, categorizing and
memorizing. The results of
this final test, paper or pro-
ject represent a large portion
of your grade.

Of course, the symptoms
of stress are more pro-
nounced during this
demanding time. These

symptoms include: sleep dif-
ficulties, headaches, fatigue,
loss of appetite (or overeat-
ing), trembling and nausea
to mention a few.

a few simple things you can
do to beat stress. The first
step is to relax. Yes, relax!
This can be accomplished by

ming can clear your
head and drive tension
away.

It is also important to eat a

variety of healthy foods
avoiding caffeine, alcohol
and sugary snacks. In addi-
tion, getting enough sleep
will help you be more alert,
less irritable and better
equipped to handle these

"challenging situations.

The Finals Week Survival

-1;-few Greek Week
chair stresses charity

By Matt Groff
Staﬁ°Writer

Erin Walker of Sigma Chi was
elected overall Greek Week co-
chairperson last night, on his
promise to make Greek Week 1994
more fun and less competitive.

“Greek Week can be improved
by eliminating some of the extrane-
ous activities,” Walker said. “The
main focus will remain — to raise
money and support the charity.”

He defeated Brent Sahl of Pi
Kappa Alpha in the election, held at
the final Inter—Fraternity Council
meeting of thewinter temi. The
meeting opened with a presentation
by Pennsylvania Special Olympics,
the charity of Greek Week 1993.

“We try to build the conﬁdence of
the athletes through interaction with
the community,” Pittsburgh Special
Olympics Director Kevin Hancock
said.

‘Hancock asked the IFC to consid-
er Pa. Special Olympics for the
Greek Week charity in the future.
He cited the mutual understanding
between the organizations and ben-
efits of a Greek Week-Special
Olympics partnership.

“We may be able to attract other
large sponsors, such as a media
organizition,” Hancock said. “The
community should know about the
positive happenings at Pitt.”

The charity will be chosen by the
newly elected Greek Week execu-
tive board, according to IFC
President Jeremy Weiss.

In his report, Weiss emphasized
another philanthropic activity, Pitt
Project Tutor, which he  Pitt stu-
dents should consider for next year.
The project involves tutoring ele-
mentary and middle school students
in Hazelwood twice a week for the
fall term.

clean. ,
-Internal Vice President Jason Huey
said the Greek sports system will be
revised next year to insure that all
intramural rules are followed by fra-
ternity sports participants. His state-
ment came in response to the recent
cancellation of fraternity softball due
to Pitt sports facilities violations.
According to Huey, cigarettes and
chewing tobacco left on the field
after fraternity sports led to corn-
plairits by Pitt football Coach Johnny
Majors and Athletic Director Oval
jaynesf The Pitt athletic department
discontinued fraternity sports for the
winter term.
-Weiss emphasized that all fraterni-
ties must comply with IFC social
monitoring regulations. If regula-
tions are not followed, fraternities
will be unable to register parties
with IFC unless they have police

protection.

Tara Munkatchy added, “We
have three members on Senate
Council and we can talk directly ‘
on a one-on-one basis to the
administration. They may listen :1
little more to us.”

“It’s not power  it’s inﬂuence,"
Brody said. ‘You have the oppor-
tunity to have administration lis-
ten to you, pay interest to what
you are trying to say.” -

Schroeder and Munkatchy
agreed that open meetings are
usually productive for both stu-
dents and board members.

“We would rather‘ be doing
things that people come up and
ask about,” Schroeder said.

One of the two attendees was
first—year student Olivia Kissel,
who used the opportunity to
question SGB members. A meni-
ber of the Student Environmental
Action Coalition, Kissel asked

about the state of Pitt’s recycling
program.

Bolton said there were prob-
lems with Pitt recycling, specifical-
ly in dorms.

“Most floors are supposed to
have three cans —— ones for alu-
minum, cardboard ancl newspa-
per,” Bolton said. “Most floors
don’t have any, or if they do have
them, they are not labeled”

He added that meetings with
administration months ago result-
ed in unfulfilled administrative
promises to “get right on it.”

Student apathy plays a part,
according to Schroeder, who said
that he sees students ignore the
recycling program totally.

“Even if a recycling bin is 10
feet away, I’ve seen students just
pitch a can in the closest can,” he
said.

Brody said that in some cases,
even when students recycle, the
three separate cans may be emp-
tied into the same trash container

~.

by janitors when garbage is col-
lected.

“I think we’ll see more empha-
sis put on recycling,” Brody said.
“But it is really up to the students
to push the university.”

Several SGB members, inclucl—
ing Brody and Bolton, told 
that recycling was something they
planned to work on over the
summer.

Kissel produced a pe-
tition’-encouraging Facilities
Management to upgrade Pitt recy-
cling, which SGB members
signed.

Kissel said she is involved in
starting a Pitt Student Action
Union, a coalition of student orga-
nizations and individual mem-
bers. She asked SGB to work
along with the forming group.

“We’re the student body,”
Kissel said. “We should be the
main focus of the university. Our
needs come second to money
and grants and research?”

Jobs

Continuedfrom page 1

“Because of the economy, a
lot of people are really just
looking for a job. Not the.
best possible job, because
they know they're not going
to have the multiple offers
they had years ago,” Perkoski
said.

Over the last 20 to 30 years,
the American work force has
undergone a radical change
in the way people perceive
their careers. Workers no
longer enter a corporation
directly out of college and
and leave it 40 years later at
retirement. Now they’re more
likely to spend their careers
ascending the ladder by mov-
ing around to various compa-
nies within their field or
switching fields altogether.

For Koval and other stu-
dents, the idea of entering a
corporation after college
graduation and leaving the
same corporation at retire-
ment age has all but disap-
peared. F.ven President
Clinton told the joint session
of Congress in February that
the average 18-year-old will
hold seven jobs in his life-
time.

“As human beings, we
don‘t like change." said Marti
Moore, director of career
counseling. "And yet, we are
faced with a world which is
changing extremely rapidly.
For most people, security is
an important issue.“

Moore said that people
today have to know the dif-
ference between job security
and employment security.
Job security is the “old style
of going to work for IBM
when you’re 22 and remain-
ing there until you‘re 62, hav-
ing health and educational
benefits, paid vacations and a
nice retirement package, all
taken care of by IBM," she
said.

But employment security,
according to Moore, is some-
thing that you learn to con-
trol and carry around with

you: learning how to be your
own career developer; figur-
ing out your best skills and
talents and developing them
and working out an interac-
tive network of contacts -—
people who can help you
and who you can help.

Moore said that the
job searcher must understand
that this will be a life-long
quest, not just something
you do during your senior
year.

Koval sees it as being about
the same as changing majors.

“As time goes by, ill have
different paths and goals,“ he
said. “l’Il have no problem
changing companies to fur-
ther my career.”

Perkoski says there are
many strategies undergradu-
ates can use to prepare
for today’s tough job market.

“People are using more
strategies to look than ever
before. A lot of people got
jobs through on-campus
recruiting,“ he said. “Over
the years that’s been going
down because companies
have found it too expensive,
so they’re looking for alterna-
tive ways to hire people."

He said that new graduates
have to use more than one
method to hunt for a job,
including on-campus recruit-
ing; sending resumes and
cover letters out on their
own; networking and joining
professional organi‘/rations
and going to job fairs.

liut Moore said the single
most important job-hunting
strategy is gaining an intern-
ship.

“F.mployers are using
internships as kind of a farm
team for new employees. The
people who hang in there,
who keep contacting and
recontacting people -— they
get jobs. It may be starting
at a lower level than 20 years
ago, but the old saying
that its easier to get a job it
you have a job is true," she
said.

‘?\X/hat Title IX requires is equal
opportunity for women," Pushinski
said.

The Federal Office of Civil Rights
was created by the Department of
Education to administer Title IX.

Pitt has been under scrutiny by
the OCR for the past yarr. After the
NCAA survey released by The
Cbromcle in April 1992, a complaint
was ﬁled with OCR against Pitt,
who was then notiﬁed of an investi-
gition.

“It's a third party that ﬁled the
complaint,” Jaynes  “We don't
know who it was. Basically what
they did was take this study that
was done and went down through
the study and said ‘Let's identify
these people who look like they are
out of compliance.’

“They requested that we send
infomration to them to determine if
we were out of compliance with
the title,” Jaynes added.

glaynes displayed the box filled
with paper that Pitt sent to OCR to
answer the 22 questions they had
for the uni\'er.sity's athletic depart-
ment on gender equity.

“l'.srrally wlrat they do is come
with an orH‘arrrpu.s site inspection
and e\.rlrr.rtr< tn.” _l;l_\tl<'.\ said of the

4 Kills rrr\estig.rtiorr “\V'e \\ ill then
gr'—.e tlrerrr .\()lllt' type of r‘<)lTt\‘lli>l‘r
plan it > rrrake sure we are in it impli-

ance with Title IX."

If OCR is unsatisﬁed with Pitt's"

proposal to amend the gender equi-
ty situation, then Pitt will have to
revise its plan until OCR feels the sit-
uation is corrected. The penalty for
noncompliance is a withholding of
federal money.

So far, the OCR has yet to
announce its appearance on Pitt’s
campus.

jaynes, along with Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor, inherited the
school’s gender equity problem.
Both came to the university in 1991,
Jaynes succeeding former Athletic
Director Ed Bozik and O'Connor
replacing former President Wesley
Posvar.

“I'm going to do everything I can
to provide for the greatest opportu-
nity in all sports,” Jaynes said. “Both
males and females should have a
quality experience at the University
of Pittsburgh. That is the comrnit-
ment Dr. O’C0nnor has, the com-
mitment I have and that's a commit-
ment our tnrstees have: That we
want to provide a quality program.“

One thing Pitt did fairly well on in
the report was the amount of schr >1-
arslrips women athletes ru‘ei\'ed in
eorrrparison to the amount of partie-
ipants [lust <>\et’ 5 per‘<.errt of the

Casual dining in the heart of Oakland

In fact, under an NCAA rule,
women will hold an advantage in
the number of basketball scholar-
ships. The women's team will have
15 and the men’s team will offer 15.

Now that Pitt has addressed its
problem with gender equity, jaynes
and Pitt have to ﬁnd solutions to
rectify the situation.

Some schools have begun com-
pensating women sports. At
Stanford University last week, the
school announced it will add new
facilities, scholarships and three
new varsity sports for women ath-
letics.

In order to meet Division I crite-
ria, a SCl‘tO()l must offer seven sports
for both men and women. Next
year, though, in order to promote
equity, Division I will require six
men's sports and eight women's to
meet its requirements.

Pitt presently offers 11 varsity
sports for men and eight for
women, and there have been ideas
about adding more on the womens
side.

“It's been that way for 15 years,"

la 'nes said of Pitts team 3l’() >or‘—

just the way it is.“

the problem is funding those pro-
grams and the interest level of those
programs," _Iaynes said of adding
varsity women sports. “\We’ve
talked about softball  We don't
even have a softball field on Cam-
pus.”

Limited space does have lasting
effects on Pitt athletic.s, and no
immediate solution is in sight.

Jaynes said that the new convoca-

tion center being built  part of
“Operation Jump Start” will only
alleviate. the congestion of indoor
sports, such as basketball, volleyball
and gymnastics.

“Facilities is an issue. Where are
you going to play?” Jaynes asked.
“Right now, with the space we
have, I don't think it would be fair to
have one of our teams, men or
women, to have to practice on the
Cathedral lawn because that's
where our students play."

The women's lacrosse team
knows that all too well. The
Cathedral lawn is its practice field.

“The [Pitt Rugby Clrrbl practices
there. and its like a big mud pit,“
Trankiem said. “Its a sad stt >131“

They rer‘ei\'e help fir >m the rrrerrs

The men's team will sometimes

allow them to practice on a field
they have rtservetl.

“The men‘s team has the stadirurr
and the Cost Center at the same
time,“ Trankienr said. "What they
don‘t use, were allowed to.”

Once, the women‘s team had
reserved, in paper, the field behind
the Cost Center for a game.
However, according to Trankiem.
they wereasked to leave the ﬁeld to
allow PitI’s baseball team to play a
home game that was originally set
as an away game.

With the help of Title IX,
the lacrosse team, &1 over the past
two seasons, might have the sup-
port on a higher level to display its
talent.

“If we had more money and sup
port, that would permit us to be
extremely competitive," Trankiem
said. "The talent is here.”

“I understand that were not a rev-
enue sport, but only two are.“
Trankiem said, referring to basket-
ball and football. ‘The university is
supposed to be here for its stu-
dents.“

Stu_[f Writer

When _leny Weber was ‘3 years
old his family didnt own a record
player, but that didnt stop him from
getting his fill of scratchy 78s.

The burly, mailman tumed shop-
kteper remembers listening to Patti
Page and Doris Day records on his
aunts phonograph, which his par-
ents borrowed, that resembled a
suitcase.

“I always loved records," said
Weber, whose thick baud and mus-
tache now show traces of gray. “I
was not much of a musicizm, but I
was always a listener."

Weber's passion for records still
burns 40 yuus later. Today he owns
three homes, two of which house
nothing but albums. His record col-
lection exceeds the one—million
mark, growing by 50 to 100 each
week.

And for the past 13 ycxus he has
and operated _Ierry's
Records. a used record and CI) shop
that takes up two floors of a building
on (f)akland‘s Forbes Avenue.

A resident of Oakland his whole
life. \'\"eber vividly remembers
record shops that have come and
gone in his neighborhood. The
lissi-x (Lird Store once housed the

“Oakland has
always been like
a hubbub of
records,” Weber
said.

Even before
he considered
going into the
used record busi-
ness, Weber’s
passion for vinyl
drove him to buy
as many records
as he could get
his hands on. He
describes himself

“I said, ‘Man, I should do this,”
Weber said. “I’ve
got a whole house-
ful of records."

After 15 years as
a mailman, the post
office laid Weber
off in 1978 when
he injured his
shoulder. And
when a friend gave
him a l)I‘(i‘2ik on rent
above the Panther
Hollow Inn, he
opened the Record
Graveyard that
year.

Two years later,
Weber wanted a
store with more
space, so he sold
his half of the busi-
ness and moved
up to the block of

and Atwood

up from the street
he opened his own

 Former mailman turns garbage ’ into Oakland vinyl

‘WY/hen I‘d say ‘Gartxige,’ theyd say,
“Oh, you only have junk records.‘
No, that’s not the iclur."

The new name came about not
out of pride so much as the fact that
Weber can always be found in the
store. Referring to the buildings sign
that looks down onto Forbes
Avenue, Weber said, “It’s the only
time I’ll ever get to see my name up
in lights."

What started out as an 800 
foot shop on the second floor of a
building has expanded to include
twice the space on that ﬂoor in addi-
tion to the third floor. And none of it
is wasted either. “When I took over
the [third ﬂoorl four years ago, the
whole floor was empty,” Weber
said. “Within a year it was full. I (IOU-
bled the whole store within a year,
because I had the room.”

On the first ﬂoor of ]erry’s
Records, empty album covers by
artists ranging from the Monkees to
Yusef Iateef line the wall near the
counter. Along with the racks of
albums and CDs that line the floor,
two walls on each floor are
crammed with overstock, duplicate
copies of Zllbtlltls already sitting in
the racks. And the stock continues
from there.

Weber converted an old print
shop in I-Ia’/lewood into a 1,600
square foot warehouse for albrurrs.
With shelves going from the floor
straight up 12 feet to the ceiling, the
whole warehouse is full. Overflow
from the building resides in one of
his houses.

"I )o you rememl X1‘ tlrese?" Weber
asks, holding out a two—track car-
tridge tape that lrxrks like an 8—track
tape shrunken to three times its nor-
mal si'/ie. "They had these in the mid-
‘6(ls. They only had l()LU‘ songs on
them.“

From behind the counter. he pulls
out a tape player zmd sticks in the
cartridge. The Beatles tune “Bad
Boy" comes blasting out moments
later, with all the quality of a transis-
tor radio. Weber laughs.

“I forgot these existed," he said.
rummaging through a handful of
similar tapes. “Somebody who
knows I like weird sh-t brought
them to me. I‘d never sell them. I just
want to keep them.“

In his line of business. Weber sees
music come in many different
shapes and sizes. The same goes for
record buyers. Weber can classify his
customers into different categories.

"I notice some guys come in here
and they want to buy as many
records as they can," he said "Then
they sell them all back and buy 2()
more. They want to hear as many
different kinds of music as they can.
I Call them absorbers."

Using himself as an example,
Weber says accumulators make up
another breed of customers. "they
love to be suntounded by things and
keep everything they buy."
Collectors, on the other hand, tend

La Femme Finlandia: Kaurisn1aki's silent Scandanavian rage

By Brian Berger i

Showcase Editor

The Match Factory Girl is
a sparse, bleak film that
works on different levels for
different reasons. As direct-
ed by Aki Kaurismaki (Tbe
Leriirzgracl Cozvboys), it tells
the tale of a pathetic Iris
(Kati Outinen) whose simple
life consists of going to work
at a match factory during the
day and cruising the campy,
inner-city life of Finland by
night, looking for love.

This is the film’s basic
premise, and Kaurismaki
does a fine job in showing
us the doldrums of Iris’
world. The opening minute
consists of a vignette of
shots showing how wood is
broken down and formed
into packaged match sticks.
We see no human interaction
until we are given a still shot
of Iris, who stands alone. __   _ _   _  g_ 
For her, her Wofk and SOCia1 Kati Outinen gets fatal inAkiKaurismaki's The Match Factory Girl. Ahh, the(un)bearable heaviness of cinema.

Si

Two Pitt Filmmakers cover some serious ground

By Bill Kirchner
Staﬂ Writer

Though most of the work at this
month’s S.M.A.E. (Students for
Media and Art Council) student film
exhibition might be characterized
as unremarkable, there were a few
notable exceptions. One of those
would have to be Hugues Benard’s
clever short, I)mner For Tbree.
Amid the technical problems and
disorganization of S.M.A.E.’s pro-
gram, Benard’s efforts definitely
stuck otit. L

And apparently to someone
other than myself, because Hugues
received an Emerging Artist Grant
from Pittsburgh Filmmakers for his
current project based on his work
in Dinner For Ybree. Afterwards, I
spoke with Hugues and his main
collaborator, Michael Burke, bofh
filmmakers at the University of
Pittsburgh, to get their reaction to
the program and get a feel for their
angle on local filmmaking.

BK: You managed to sell Dimter
_/or Ybree to a European cable chan-
nel, how exactly did that happen"
HB: They basically buy tip short
films to fill _a time slot after a feature.
All I did was submit my film and
four or five weeks later got an
answer.

BK: But you’re making film, not
video; so ideally woulcln’t you
rather see them shown on a big
screen venue?

HB: Yes, but they don’t use shorts

in theaters anymore so the only
way you can show them is through
television or film festivals.

BK: Like S.M.A.E.?

HB: Well, the concept of S.M.A.F.. is
great. They say they are opening
it up to anyone to show films. That
is OK. I mean some of the films
were really good, some were really
bad. But that’s okay because it’s
open to everyone. They just didn’t
know what they were doing. It’s
not a film festival. There’s no selec-
tion.

BK: But doesn’t it give you some
exposure?

HB: That’s what S.M.A.E. was trying
to do. Which is good, but once
again were back to how unprofes-
sional those people are.

MB: It’s not really that they’re
unprofessional, I just think they
were a little self-serving. I didn’t
know if they more interested in
showing [Other] student film pro-
jects or their own. ‘

BK: So S.M.A.E. was less than ideal.
Is there another way to give student
films exposure and avoid these
problems?

HB: The altemative is to create a
film festival at Pitt. Every major uni-
versity has some kind of festival
running. If they have money to
hand out, fine. But even just to cre-
ate some kind of award as recogrri-
tion. It’s not like we’re missing peo
pie for jurors because we have a
great faculty here as far as ﬁlm stud-
res.

BK: Mike, what do you think of
Hugues idea of a film festival?

MB: I agree. There are other things,
like PC-TV, btit I don’t know
anyone that doesn’t live in
Downtown Pittsburgh that gets it.
We could use some kind of public
access that’s on every cable lsysteml
Just more access for independent
material.

BK: What about Hugues’ high
opinion of the faculty here and at
Filmmakers?

MB:Yeah, I think it’s really good
here. As far as Filmmakers, basical-
ly, I’m just there to use the equip-
ment. I don’t think that’s a criticism
of Filmmakers as much as it is that I
think the best way to learn about
film is to get the equipment, go out
and use it

HB: And when you can do that at
Filmmakers for $250 for a year, it’s
worth it.

BK: Is the need to work together
economic? ~

MB: It’s more than just economic, I
really think film is a collaborative
process. It’s almost impossible to
do individually. What were trying
to do is pull together people with
similar views on film.

HB: We were talking about the
[current] project today, and I was
thinking back and I can’t believe all
the things I had Mike do when we
were shooting on the day of that
blizzard. He has so much patience
it’s incredible. Anyone else would
just say “F—k you.” That’s when

you see it’s dedication and you
really see the result afterwards. We
have the same goal; we want to
make films.

MB: And, I think, once you engage
in a project you have to make a
commitment. So, regardless of how
cold it is or how pissed off you are
you have to get it done.

HB: That’s where you can see if
someone really wants to make
films. Even if you have to just carry
lights around. Its not the best job,
but you have to lcam.

MB: Its pretty simple. If you want
to make films then that’s what you
have to do; you have to make films.
And when you work with the same
people it helps insure that you
make some progression with each
project.

HB: To keep each other on track.
BIC How do you react to someone
like Oliver Stone saying that you
should direct what you write?

HB: First, I think there is a lot of it
that is true because in the process
of writing, if you’re the writer, you
have in your mind the image. You
have in your mind what it’s going
to look like. Even if you don’t
know what the shots will look like,
you have a specific type of location.
When you do the opposite and
you’re shooting someone else’s
script and putting it on the screen,
you’re really taking someone else’s
idea and adapting it to your idea.
MB: You’re interpreting their
vision.

HB:Which is a lot harder. Which is
what we are doing right now. I
didn’t write the script were doing
now. It’s the first time. we’re doing
something I didn’t write, and I don’t
like it.

BIC How do you handle who takes
credit for what? .

MB: Well, I’rn not worried about
getting that credit. I just think I have
a definite idea on what my films
should be and that Hugues is pretty
closely aligned to that. Even though
we don’t have the exact same
tastes.

HB: If you really look at the idea of
collaboration, the director in this
country really gets all the credit.
But if you look closely at someone
like Coppola or Greenaway,
you look at the people
behind them and you  the same
cinematographer, the same art
director. The same people work
on those films. So, I mean, Coppola
gets the credit because he’s at
the head, but he knows if
you take away those people
the filrns won’t look the same.

BIC What’s next’

HB: Well, Mike and I are going on
a trip. We’re going to the Cannes
Film Festival.

MB: Contacts. We need to make
contacts.

HB: Hopefully, to try to raise some
money for our next project and
also to sell this film. And at this level
the only concem is to get enough
money to make the next film.

is too late and the deal is con-
summated. He has to endure the
consequences.

In the ensuing months, he
goes through distrustfulness,
selﬁshness and only when he
matures is he ready to return the
love and loyalty he previously
felt he deserved

The final edge of this
love/power triangle is ever—dis-
tinguished Robert Redford, as
dominating John Gage, who not
only has the power to buy and
sell peoples lives but also their
emotions. At first glance, he’s a
smooth, cocky billionaire, sure
that his money will lead him
wherever he wants to go. .

Yet it is proven to him that
even with the hard edge of his
diamonds and riches, he is still
susceptible to the strife that unre-
quited love leaves in its wake.

Redford’s character sparks
heated emotions from both
Moore and Harrelson. Gage sex-
ilysmiles at Diana and she is
affected by it — she turns her
head and tries to avoid seeing it
but she knows it is there. David
sees what effects Gage has on
Diana and that infuriates him.

Wfrth a cast of such powerful
characters there is no doubt that
this film is more than just another
star-vehide. It poses questions to
the audience using the basic and
reliable cinema techniques —

symbolism, suspense and raw
emotion.

Director Adrian Lyne (Fatal
Attraction, 9 1/2 Wee/es) weaves
a tale using the age-old wedding
band as a symbol that leads the
spectator to believe that love is
an impenetrable bond. A man
and woman who have little
more than each other are given
the chance to make more for
themselves in just one night But
that $1 million night could be the
night to break all bonds.

He also doesn’t leave his audi-
ence wanting for the visual
aspects of the married couple’s
intimacy. While showing no
nudity whatsoever, Lyne sensu-
ally displays the overwhelming
passion between the two, leav-
ing the spectator spent also. In
this scene, the presence of
money shows its importance as
Diana and David explore each
other intermingled with the
paper strips of money.

Physically and emotionally,
this movie strives to ask the audi-
ence questions and may not give
them the answers that they are
looking for or perhaps does not
provide any answers at all. It
makes you think about the rela-
tive power love has over people.
Is it strong enough to give up all
otherdreamsorwill itbebroken
by forces stronger than it is?

life are equally unaccompanied.

Kaurismaki’s camera work is pre-
cise throughout the film. And it has
to be, the film contains little dia-
logue — we don’t hear Iris’ desper-
ate voice until the film is nearly 20
minutes along. The camera follows
Iris as she goes to a tango bar,
where she sits waiting to be asked to
dance. One by one the girls around
her are chosen, but Iris, with the
camera squarely and plainly focused
on her, sits and waits. Later, she
goes home alone and lies awake in
her bed until the camera fades out.

The film’s deeper purpose surfaces
as Iris, who lives with and supports
her paren'ts, buys a cheap red dress,

which prompts her father to smack
her and label her a whore. These are
the first words we hear that are
directed at Iris. Instead of returning
it, she ventures to a club where she
sits idly, until she is seduced by a
wealthy bearded man. Again, there
is no dialogue between them and we
see Iris the next morning rising from
his bed.

From here, the action increases as

the dialogue picks up and the thin,

“dishrag” Iris begins to wither away.
She falls for him, but his cruel words
“nothing could touch me less than
your affection” drive Iris into irra-
tional, emotional behavior. She des-
perately needs to escape, and the
film’s sentimental appeal lies in her

search. It is a premise that has been
touched on in the past but never
quite in this way.

Because of the lack of dialogue,
this film works on feel. Kaurismaki’s
direction works so well because he
breathes life into scenes where noth-
ing appears to be happening. The
placement of the camera leaves the
viewer wondering and interpreting
the film’s actions. Its apparent
Socialist overtones and fatalistic
darkness suggest a depressing, ugly
picture. But Kaurismaki bleeds this
film with empathy and slight comic
overtones. The scene where Iris’
bearded obsession picks her up on a
date and ends up sitting on the
couch having coffee and cakes with

her parents is amusing, even if noth-
ing is said.

In a Village Voice interview,
Kaurismaki said, “You can write a
script about anything. I have a
matchbox in my hand, you think,
where does it come from? A factory.
A girl works in a factory, and so on.”
While he succeeds in telling a simple
plot in Tbe Match Factory Girl, he
does it in a quiet way that evokes
feeling and empathy that far exceed

the film’s dialogue. It’s a heroic feat.

for both the director and his female
star. .

The Match Factory Girl runs
exclusively at Filmmakers at the
Fulton now through April 23rd

to be finicky, buying only certain
things which must look 

The “curse of compact discs,” as
Weber eloquently puts it, has creat-
ed a new breed of music buyers: the
consumer. “They go out and buy
things on impulse. Six months later
they drop it. They don’t even want
to  it around.”

As an example, Weber recalls
when the band Fine Young
Cannibals had a minor hit a few
years ago and its CD became a big
seller. \When people realized they
only liked one song on the disc, they
showed up at Jerrys Records trying
to sell the disc. “I call that the MTV
Syndrome,” he said "They push you
into buying things you don’t really
want.”

When asked about the increasing
popularity of compact discs, Weber
quickly stated that the shiny pieces
of plastic complicate his life. In his
store the disc covers sit in the racks,
for browsing purposes, but the disc
itself must be written up in a log and
kept behind the counter to discour-
age theft and to keep track of-stock.

Weber says the effort involved in
keeping track of CDs compares to

the job of a librarian or stockboy.
“I’m used to just letting the music
ﬂow through here with records,” he
complained. “This is too much like
work”

Weber believes CDs, along with
factors like MTV, have changed the
marketing and perception of music.
Videos emphasize the visual aspects
of artists at the expense of the music
itself. At the same time, compact
discs don’t sell music c)n the basis of
visuals, so people often buy new
releases based on the quality of the
latest video they have seen

“People see a woman writhing to
a Duran Duran song [in a video] and
they’ll run out and buy the CD,”
Weber said. “Then they’ll realize
there’s nothing to it. Six months later
they dump it. They don’t care what
they get for it.” A person who paid
$15 for a new compact disc usually
sees $3 when selling it to Weber.

Ashe espouses the virtues of
record albums, Weber’s eyes light
up behind his glasses. He continual-
ly thumps his big hands on the stack
of 30 discs in front of him on the
counter. Record albums give off ‘a
warm feeling, he said, as compared
to the sterile feeling that comes from

the plastic and aluminum of CD5.

“Look at it,” he said, picking up an
Isley Brothers record from a. stack of
albums. “It’s got the picture on the
front. It’s got the gatefold [opening
cover]. It’s got the lyrics. You can
read them. You don’t need a magni-
fying glass.

“[Frankl Zappa said vinyl freaks
and fondleists and fetishists, which is

true! At lcxrst it’s something substan-

tial,” he said.

Despite his distaste for selling
CD5, Weber does in fact own several
oldies. collections that have been
issued on disc. However, he quickly
admits he owns them strictly for their
portability, taking them to parties or
picnics along with a portable CD
player. They aren’t part of his "collec-
tion. “I don’t consider them anything
but disposable,” he said. “I’rn not
that generation.”

But one day, Weber believes, a
backlash will occur, making records
popular on a large scale again. “In
this country,” he said, “it seems like
people throw sh-t out one minute
and 10 years later everybody’s look-
ing for it.” He mentions the phenom-
ena of baseball card and cereal box
collecting as examples.

“The other night a woman came
in with a couple crates full of
records. I said to her, ‘Iady, did you
call? A

“She said, ‘Don’t you buy records?’

“I said ‘Yeah, but if you’re bring-
ing in 500, it’s nice to know in

advance.’”

The preceding happens quite
often in a used record store like
]erry’s. People often bring upwards
of 200 albums to the store, hoping to
sell all of them. Once in a while a
collection might contain some rari-
ties, like old jazz or early punk
albums. Weber will buy an entire
collection of records like that but
only, he stresses, if they’re in good
condition.

"If there’s writing on it or the cor-

ner’s bent or if the record itself is
worn, it may be a good record to
play,” he said, “but don’t try to sell it
unless its something extremely rare.

“If you’ve got a record that’s in
perfect condition, and it has the orig-
inal poster in it or the original gate-
fold cover  that’s the one you put
on your shelf and don’t play. Tape it
and let it sit there.” b

However, most of the time a seller
will unload what Weber calls
“throwaway rock,” like Bruce
Springsteen, Journey or Rush. The
store has acquired hundreds of
copies of such albums. This hap-
pens because, until recently, Weber
might buy 50 of a 200-album collec-
tion for the regular price of a dollar
or two and give the seller a ﬂat rate
for the rest, leaving Weber with
another 150 records to “warehouse
for the future.”

But the decline of records
changed all that. Three out of every
four people that shop in ]erry’s
Records either don’t own a turntable
or, as students, don’t have their
turntables with them. As a result,
vinyl does not move as quiddy as it
did in the past.

Ironically, Weber says the fact that
he still sells albums can be attributed
to their popularity abroad In coun-
tries like Japan, England and
Belgium, he said records are more
popular than compact  People
from those countries come to
America looking for used records to
take back home. Different Japanese
men visit ]erry’s each month, he said,
buying everything from soul music
to Iawrence Welk.

"The world’s crazy,” Weber said,
throwing up his hands. “We’re
throwing all our records away and
buying CD5 for $15 a piece, and
Japanese and German and English
men are buying all our records for
two and three dollars a piece. It
makes no sense. But if it wasn’t for
them I couldn’t sell any recorch.”

“I’ve got enough records to last
metherestofmylifetoliaentoand
to sell, so I can live comfortably. I’rn
getting disinterested [in the business]
and that’s what’s bad”

The fact that more of his business
deals with compact discs disillusions
Weber. He says he might give them
up altogether in the next few years
and move into a new mLtsic—relatecl
area.

With a personal record collection
that boasts such oddities as Spanish
flamenco versions of Beatles songs
and over 300 calypso albums with
the same songs done by different
artists, Weber says he would like to
act as a consultant to anyone who
wants a certain brand of unusual

. music for a film or commercial. He

would also like to put together cus-

' tom made compilations of different

musics, “stuff I know about that no
one else knows about”

To show what he means when he
says unusual albums, Weber reaches
into one of the shelves behind the
counter. He pulls out an album by
poet laureate Maya Angelou.
Entitled “Calypso Queen,” the 1956
album shows the artist dancing with
a glow in her eyes. It’s a far cry from
the woman who spoke at the
Presidential Inauguration. “She’d
probably give me a $100 for this just
to get it off the market,” Weber
quipped.

Owning over one million records
might be impressive, Weber said,
but the music should not sit on
shelves. “Big deal, you’ve got :1 mil-
lion records,” he said. “If no one’s lis-
teningtothem,whatgoodisitdoing
anybody?”

With this in mind, Weber wants to
move away ﬁom CD5, tapes and “all
the high tech stuﬂ” and cater more
toward collectors. “I’m hoping to
find a big old place, away from this
madness,” Weber said, “out on the
highway with a lot of parking. It

. would just be open on Friday,

Saturday and Sunday. I’ll have my

collection there. So if you’re looking-

for something, you can find it”

On this cold, rainy Thursday
morning, smoky saxophone music
canbeherrdfromrhebottomofthe
stairs tojenys Records. It’s 9 a.m., an
hour before the store opens, but
Weber has been there for neariy two
hours, pricing the stacks of albums
and CD5 that fill up the front
counter.

Bob, one of the four people
employed by Weber, picks up the
new items and files them in the
appropriate music section. A few
older customers are already min-
gling around the store. Weber seems
polite, albeit preoccupied. “I hate
days like this,” he said, referring to
the weather. “It reminds me too
much of the days when I was a mail-
man.” ,

As he talks about music, he pulls
out another rarity from the piles of
albums at his feet — Ybejunleie, The
juice/aead, Minus Me by Johnny
Cash and his family. Weber, who
knows his Johnny Cash, says he
never saw the album before it came
into the store. He seems excited by
his new find.

“You see,” he said, holding the
newly discovered treasure, “this is
what makes the business fun”

At exactly 10 o’clock, customers
begin coming up the stairs, and
Weber, with a renewed sense of
enthusiasm about his work, is’ ready
for another day.

  

(ﬁve up the funds  

Yesterday, Yhe PittNezLs reported on the university’s athletic department
inequities under the ruling of Title IX, which states that “all universities
must provide equal varsity athletic opportunities in proportion to its under-
graduate population.” Pitt has 11 male varsity sports and eight female var-
sity sports. It spends 95.3 percent on total recruiting costs for men and
only 4.7 percent on women. When asked about this, Pitt Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes claimed there was an error in the report and gave numbers
that were sl-ightbt closer together.

Inequities such as this are only tolerated because the NCAA administra-
tion and university heads’ fail to enforce regulations such as Title IX. This,
most likely, all begins with money. Universities only want to give to the

‘programs from which they know they can get money. This is the same

reason that it is the revenue, not the non-revenue sports, that get special-
ized treatment.

The reason Title IX was created is so that the revenue sports, such as
football and basketball at Pitt, wouldn’t overshadow the non-revenue
sports, which all wornen’s sports happen to be. Therefore, if the NCAA or
universities don’t recognize Title IX in every universitys case, then what is
the point of having this rule? They have to enforce this rule equally
between all universities. \Vrth the enforcement of this rule students would
be able to enjoy sports that aren’t necessarily on TV or big money makers.
Sports like women’s soccer or softball may be just the solution to the gen-
der inequity at Pitt By adding these sports the numbers would come clos-
er together.

Industrial pragmatism

The expression “collaborative competition” seems to be an oxymoron.
Businesses are supposed to compete not collaborate. An  or group
develops an idea, ﬁnds the capital to fund it and reaps the proﬁts from
his/her hard work. Or so the story goes.

Such is the case with almost every major industry in the United States
today. Valuing the entrepreneur and profits above all else, the United States
became the world’s greatest producer precisely through hands-off govern-
ment and rugged  The question is how much longer will this
kind of philosophy prevail? Hopefully not much longer.

The big three auto makers are discussing plans to collaborate on the
development of an electric car to meet the requirements of the clean air law
first enacted in California and adopted by several North Eastern States.

Officials of the company said that they were considering the plan because
of the impending deadlines in California that say that, by 1998, 2 percent of
every auto company’s sales be zero emissions vehicles. They should stop
considering and act on it; the results could be greater than they had hoped .

In his book Head to Head the mining economic battle hetzueenjtpan,
Emqoe and the United States MIT economist Lester Thurow paints a some-
what grim picture for American manufacturers. If Amerimn business contin-
ues to emphasize short—tem1 proﬁtability over the long-term market-led
growth that the Europeans andjapanese practice, he says the results will be
further economic decline for America.

He draws a distinction between the Anglo-Saxon capitalism (emphasizing
competition), practiced in America and Great Britain, and the communitari-
an capitalism practiced in Germany and Japan (emphasizing collaboration).
Having said that, it is hardly ironic that while the big three auto makers have
seen their market shares decline, the Germans and Japanese have seen
theirs rise. Some point to protected foreign markets and an open American
one as explanation Nothing could be further from the truth.

It takes 19 hours for Japanese manufacturers (whether produced inJapan
or America) to produce a car that takes an American producer 26 hours.
Plain and simple — both the Japanese and Germans have adapted to
changing worid conditions bealuse of the collaborative techniques that they
employ. Since the automobile industry is usually a reﬂection of the economy
as a whole, the big three could go a long way toward changing the
American philosophy of business if they collaborate on this project They
have to start somewhere. How about now?

Smokeless World not hard to imagine

Senator Grecmleafs Bill puts out the fire for smo/eers

Headed for legislature in our
state capital is Sen. Stewart
Greenleafs bill that would ban
smoking in virtually all indoor
public (and many private)
places. This bill, which doubt-
less has a serious struggle
ahead of it on its way to
becoming law, is one of the
most dramatic attempted strides
toward protecting the rights of
the non—smoker to health and
comfort. Already, however, it is

under attack, even from non-. '

smokers who feel uncomfort-
able in the face of such a dra-
matic shift in the priorities of
our culture.

For example, a recent editori-
al in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
charges that the bill is a mani-
festation of a “zeal to eradicate
smoking” brought about by “a
mean streak of intolerance and
self—righteousness.” This abrupt
curtailing of what has for hun-
dreds of years been seen as an
undeniable right to smoke is
suddenly making many
Americans nervous about what
rights may go next. But smok-
ing is undoubtedly something
that we’ll all be better off with-
out, which is something you
can’t say about most rights.

If this bill passes, we’ll be

I one step closer to ridding our-

selves of something both harm-
ful and ugly. Until now, due to
the priorities of our culture,
smokers have gained the per-
petual benefit of the-doubt,
even after we discovered the
health consequences of the
habit. Because of this, each
memberof the non-smoking
majority (remember the role of
the majority in a democracy?)

has been exposed to the conse-

-....a...._..»..... .1..- g 3. .9; .. or -_ ugh ..-;..:..9..o.n..I~ra-..a J 5. ah! I. mink.-is \.'..'¢M!.n‘rnhnP*A'.£¢.'.tA.*..!-.h«.!t

,‘

quences of a self-destructive
habit that he or she hasn’t even
been foolish enough to partake
in directly. What could possibly
be more unfair? _

The PG editorial also states,
“But anti-smoking crusaders
aren’t content to keep smoking
confined to designated areas,
away from nonsmokers  They
want it out on the curb.” You
bet we do. In fact, I hope that
in a few years we’ll be able to

Smith
do even better. And Sen.
Greenleafs bill is an excellent
step in that direction.

I know this all sounds a little
extreme, but think about the
habit that we’re taking on here.
This is a chemical dependency
that takes a hold so profound
on its users that most of them
can never free themselves of it.
It kills thousands of people per
year, both users and non-users,
and it damages the health of
the children of users who are
exposed to it constantly in their
homes. We get worked up over
asbestos buried deep in our
walls and we don’t care about
this? ’

The tobacco industry could
use a few solid whacks too. In

_ the face of declining demo-

graphics of smokers, they went
after less wealthy minorities
until test marketing of brands
for inner city residents was
aborted, thanks to loud public
protest. The next step, which
continues today, has been
using cartoon characters in
advertising to attract children,

in spite of laws restricting chil-
dren from smoking. (Joe Camel
is a brilliantly horrible creation.

,Where else have you seen a

combination between a cartoon
animal and a giant phallic sym-
bol?)

This is an industry on the
run, adopting desperate tactics
to hold off the end. After the
release of findings that cited
cigarette smoke as a clear dan-
ger to the health\of children,
the tobacco industry accused
the researchers of needlessly
injecting emotional concerns
into a scientific debate.
Marlboro has slashed the prices
of its products so that smokers
will not be discouraged by
higher taxes on tobacco. All the
while, the company continues
its futile cry that no real link
between smoking and darn-
aged health has been estab-
lished. This is mass denial on

the scale of the last years of

international Communism.

I have seen and heard many
people say that a move as dras-
tic as the Greenleaf Bill is
unnecessary for a cause that is
already on its way to winning.
But this bill could be how the
fight is won; it certainly has to
end with legislation of some
kind, since the tobacco industry
will spend as much of its mas-
sive resources as it has to in
order to ensure that smoking
remains “cool.” The Greenleaf
Bill would remove smoking
from our everyday lives, which
would shatter the myth that we
cannot do without it. Believe
me, we can.

Two of the most simple plays in
baseball -— the call of a name and
the “slash” technique —— helped lead
the Pitt Panthers to a 10-4 long-ball
victory over the Akron Zips yester-
day afternoon.

Everything began in the bottom of
the first inning, as Craig Crawley
heard his name echo from behind
first base.

“First base Coach Ueffl Minick
called my first name, and usually
when he calls your first namethat
means fastball,” Crawley said.

The Joe Paris fastball quickly
turned into a shot down the left—field
line, canying over the wall to give
the Panthers 21 quick 1-0 lead in the
bottom of the first

“It was a fastball inside and I just
went with the pitch and I just hit it
out,” Crawley said.

After the Zips took a 4-3 lead in
the third inning, a slash play — a
fake bunt, swing—away technique —-
by center ﬁelder Al lardo generated
a raucous fifth inning rally as the
Panthers regained the lead for good.

“The first two pitches were up and
in. So he threw the next pitch and I
turned around to slash and pulled
back, and it was a fastball up and its

final word (maybe) on the
Packers’ prize catch:

-Looking for unheralded
powers-to-be next season in
college hoops, start with
Temple and then check out
the power-packed Big Ten,
with Minnesota, Ohio State
and Wisconsin.

Temple rebounded from a
10-10 start this season against
the nation’s second toughest
schedule, despite the
December loss of point
guard Vic Carstarphen to
injury and the January loss of
center Frazier Johnson to
academics. The Owls have
no seniors on theroster, six
freshman and three rising
stars in Aaron McKie, Eddie
Jones and Rick Brunson.
They should boast a Top 10
preseason ranking in ‘93 and

them, should reach the Final
Four

Minnesota proved that the

Voshon Lenard is a dynamite

Lawrence Funderburke will
be back for his curtain

with the sizzling backcourt
duo of Derek Anderson and
Greg Simpson, OSU should
be tough, maybe Top 10

tremendous stretch run, after
Anderson had been injured
for most of the year. And
Funderburke has help on the
boards with another soph-to-

of college basketball.” P
Walton tops off his own ver-
sion of March Madness by
ripping Nick Van Exel and
actually has the nerve to say
that “reaching the Final Four
is not that great of an
achievement.” Bill, get a clue.

Pens ‘roll into the playoffs as

By Tom Schneider
and Jim Clark

The Pitt News

/Ea'itor’s note: This is the first

part of a two—part preview on
the Stanley Cup Playoffs]
- At last, after seven long
months of largely meaningless
games, the Stanley Cup Playoffs
have finally arrived. The most
notable presence again is that of
the two-time defending cup
champs, the Pittsburgh
Penguins. After finishing the
regular season with an 18-game
unbeaten streak, the Pens are
the obvious favorites heading
into this year’s playoffs.

This year’s competition also
features several upstarts, such
as the Quebec Nordiques and
the Toronto Maple Leafs, who
each finished last in their divi-
sion last season and now find
themselves in the hunt for the
silver.

Two of the most notable
absences from this year’s festivi-
ties are those of the New York
Rangers and Edmonton Oilers.
The Rangers finished first in the
overall standings last season,
only to lose to the Pens in the
second round of the playoffs.
Bad coaching and bad playing,
spurred by the loss of defense-
man Brian Leetch, have led to
their demise this season. As for
Edmonton, once the league’s
premier powerhouse, it finds
itself watching from home for
the first time since entering the
league in 1979.

Here's how we predict the
first round to unfold:

Patrick Division

What was last year’s best divi-

 

sion has become a feeding

juggernaut, the Pittsburgh

opening—round opponent, the
New York Islanders, are in post-
season play for the first time
since a first-round loss in the

Pens twice at the Igloo this year.
Still, the only serious chal-
lenge the Penguins will face in

Islanders’ defense is, the
Penguins’ offense is 10 times as
powerful. The Pens’ top scoring
line of Mario Lemieux, Kevin
Stevens and Rick Tocchet has
accounted for nearly half of the
Penguins’ goals this season. All
three have over 100 points —

against. Islander right winger
Patrick Flatley has hurt them
here in the past — he has
scored three (two in one game)
against the Pens this year.

The Islanders’ forwards,
Pierre T urgeon, Steve Thomas,
Derek King and Benoit Hogue,
are a talented group. This
group, though, will be no match
for the Penguins defense.

After years of sub-par perfor-
mance, the Penguin “D” is now
ranked third in the league. The
“Swedish Connection” of Ulf
and Kjell Samuelsson provides
perhaps the league’s best pure
defenseman (Ulf) and a night-
mare to enemy wingers entering
the zone (Kjell). Larry Murphy
has quietly become a top con-
tender for the Norris Trophy as
the league’s top defenseman,
while leading all NHL defense-
men in plus-minus rating.

The Pens have a definite
advantage between the pipes.
Tom Barrasso has arguably
been the best goalie in the
league this year, leading the
NHL with 43 wins. On the flip
side, the Islander tag team of
Mark Fitzpatrick and Glenn
Healy is just too shaky. Theyare
two average goaltenders with
bad playoff experience.
Between them, they are 2-8
with a 4.40 goals against aver-
age in 15 playoff games.
Barrasso won more playoff
games last year than this tan-
dem has played in over its
entire career.

Even with all of this in mind,
we are going to be generous
and give the Islanders one win
in this series, because of their
record against the Pens this
year. Pens in five.

vs. (3?) New Jersey Devils

Should the Devils finish the
season in third place, they will
end up facing the unpredictable
Caps. This is a contest between
two enigmatic teams with the
Capitals having’ no scoring up
front, while the Devils have no
scoring  anywhere.

Washington will be led by its
trio of defensemen Kevin
Hatcher, A] (Wild Thing) Iafrate
and Sylvain Cote. This Capital
threesome is the only group in
NHL history with each member
having 20 or more goals. The
blistering 100—plus mph slap-
shot of the Wild Thing will be in
the mind of the New Jersey net-
minders, as well as any Devil
defenseman who thinks of
blocking it.

Other than the big three,
there is really not too much else
to speak about on the
Washington team. It is thin at
every other position. Don’t be
fooled by the Caps’ second-
place finish in the Patrick
because they are not that good
of a team. They have the worst
division record of any playoff
team. _

New Jersey, without the ben-
efit of having a player with
more than 80 points on the sea-
son, will have to rely on its
strong physical game to shut

down the Caps. The Devils’.

defense, which includes Scott
Stevens and Ken Daneyko, will,
if anything, make life miserable

for the Washington forwards.

The goaltending matchup fig-
ures to be fairly even. Both
Devils’ goalie Chris Terreri and
Caps’ netminder Don Beaupre
are proven playoff performers.
If they should falter, expect
backups Craig Billington of
New Jersey and Rick Tabaracci
of the Caps to step up.

But the Caps’ lowly division
record stands out here. Devils in
six. ' '

Adams Division

(1) Boston Bruins vs. (4)
Buffalo Sabres

With the return of Cam Neely,
the Bruins have soared into first
in the Adams. Adam Oates has
been an MVP—type player all
year long, while rookie Joe
Juneau has built on his strong
play in the playoffs last season.

Speaking of MVP contender,
Buffalo’s Pat LaFontaine has
shown that he’s one of the
game’s best, finishing second in
the scoring race. Along with
winger Alexander Mogilny and
his 70—plus goals, this duo
makes up two-thirds of one of
the fastest lines in hockey.

On defense, there’s no‘con-
test. Boston’s Ray Bourque has
played strong the second half of
the season while Don-Sweeney
and Glen Wesley, though not
spectacular, still get the job
done.

In contrast, Buffalo’s only
strong blue-liner is former
Penguin Doug Bodger. The rest
of its core’ is undependable.

In goal, Buffalo will be rely-
ing on Grant Fuhr to make up
for its poor defense, while Andy
Moog will have an easier time
in net for the Bruins.

The overall strength of Boston
will be too much for Buffalo’s
single-line team. Bruins in
six.

(2) Quebec Nordiques vs.
(3) Montreal Canadiens

The offseason trade of Eric
Lindros to Philadelphia has
transformed the Nordiques from
perennial cellar dwellers to
championship contenders.
Years of high draft picks and
smart deals have paid off as

Quebec is a terror on offense

with Joe Sakic, Mats Sundin,
Owen Nolan, Mike Ricci and
Valeri Kamensky.

The Canadiens under Jacques
Demers have turned from a bor-
ing defensive-minded team into
a high-octane offensive power-
house with Kirk Muller, Vincent
Damphousse, Brian Bellows
and Stephane Lebeau leading
the way.

But when you score more,
your defense will suffer  and
it has in Montreal, as Patrick
Roy hasn’t dominated as in pre-
vious years.

Steve Duchesne is the offen-
sive threat on Quebec’s blue
line, which also features Curt

Leschyshyn and Steven Finn.
Look for Duchesne to post
some serious numbers during
this series.

Ron Hextall is one of the all-
time best playoff goaltenders as
he proved in 1987 when he
won the Conn Smythe on a
Philadelphia team that lost the
Stanley Cup to Edmonton. He
will be a definite key.

Quebec might be young and
inexperienced, but the Habs
have a recent history of poor
playoff play. Nords in six.

Look in next Monday’s Pitt
News for previews of the
matchups in the Campbell
Conference.

 

INVITATION 'l‘() NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES

Faculty in the Linguistics Department's American Indian Languages program invite students of Native
American ancestry to explore the languages, and through languages the cultures, of their heritage. We will offer
Directed Study courses to individual students (or small groups), helping students to learn about their ancestor’s
languages. The only restriction is that we must be able to find materials for students to read and work with; but
since most languages of North America and MesoAmerica, and many languages of South America, are either fairly
well documented or members of well-documented language families, we do not anticipate having to turn anyone

away.

Students will work with one of three Linguistics faculty members: Daniel Everett, Terrence Kaufman. or Sarah
Thomason. (We may have to restrict the number of students who enroll in any given term. because we will teach
these special courses in addition to our normal course load.) Each course will begin with a general survey of Native
American language families and their distribution, followed by intensive work with one language or language
group. The course is available for two or three credits. Students who prefer a course that focuses on a detailed I
general survey of the languages of the Americas should enroll instead in our regular course in American Indian

Languages. taught by Professor Kaufman (next offering: Fall 1993).

For further information, call the Linguistics Department at 624-5900.

not be an Atlanta Hawk come
l‘)‘)5-‘)4. Can you see him in
purple and gold?

-And finally, time to have a
say on the Reggie Wliite sign-
ing. Football is unquestionably
headed down the same tragic
road that baseball has taken, at
least for the short term. Until a
proposed salary cap kicks in,
forget all sanity as far as
salaries goes. Forget loyalty.
Fans, forget rooting for your
favorite team and root for your
favorite players.

And if people want to be bit-
ter at anyone, it shouldn’t be
Reggie. He has proven over
eight years to be the best
defensive player in football,
and perhaps the finest defen-
sive lineman ever to step on a
football field. Seventeen mil-
lion dollars or $70 million --

whatever he received, he is
worth every penny. lt’s funny,
in the day and age where par~
ents, writer-\ and fans in gener-
al are screaming and pleading
for a real live role model --
not just someone who dunks a
basketball or carries a football,
but» an awe—inspiring model
human being -—- there are
people out there who actually
begrudge Reggie White, the
ultimate role model, a man the
likes of which you may never
see again.

As unmatched as his contri-
butions on the football field
are, they pale when consider-
ing his contributions to the
community -— like his min-
istry, the home near
Philadelphia he and his wife
Sara have for unwed mothers,
the counseling of youth and
the work on the street corners.

Remember what Reggie will be
doing with this money: going
into the Milwaukee projects
and saving lives. Who cares if
he took forever to sign? This
decision held great conse-
quences: the one and only
chance for Reggie to get his
just due monetarily, and to
determine where he’ll finish
his career.

Wantvto complain? Scream
about average offensive line-
men snagging multimillion
buck deals or mediocre quar-
terbacks getting nearly three
million. Two things that will
never go together are Reggie
White and hypocrisy. He didn’t
ask for all this attention. All he
did was e..“'1 it. He’s the real
deal —- on and off the field.

Baseball

Continued from page 9
just what I like,” Lardo said. “I turned
on it well and hit it well.”

‘‘\What [the slash] does is enable
you to pull the bat back and get

your weight back,” Pitt head coach‘

Mark Jackson said. “Sometimes that
actually helps guys with their hitting.
Even though its a fake bunt and hit
and even though you’re not trying to
hit the ball real far, sometimes thafs
the result.” ,

Pitt starter Brian Shaeffer had a
rough outing, but was spelled by his
replacement, Mickey Vincent who
was solid if not brilliant, yielding no
runs in five innings while picking up
his first victory of the season.

“IfI can try to keep the batters off
balance, and if I can do that, then
things will work out all right,”
Vincent said.

“I thought that they would have
trouble with Mickey since he throws
somewhat similar as [Panther pitch-
er] Rob IHanawalt, who Akron faced
on Mondayl,” Jackson said. “I
thought theyd have trouble with his
breaking ball and change-up —
which they did, and that’s why I
made the change.”

Vincent occasionally mixed in his
fastball with a change—up that con-
sistently bafﬂed caustic Zip hitters,
sometimes at a sloth—like 51 mph.

“IIhe change-up] is a very decep-
tive pitch and it really confuses the
hitters,” Vincent said. “It sets up
every other pitch I throw because it
looks just like a fastball coming in,
but it’s very much off-speed. Then
when I throw the fastball they were
behind it.”

Akron head coach Dave Fross
watched as his bullpen turnstile
turned all day, using ﬁve pitchers on
the afternoon. Fross politely
declined comment as he briskly
packed away the Zips’ equipment

After Crawleyfs homer, the Zips
came back in the top of the second
to tie the game at one. Aaron
DeAnna would score on Mike
Stoops’ groundout to short, but
would do most of his damage in the

third.

Coming to the plate with two on
and two out, DeAnna lined a
Shaeffer offering over the center
ﬁeld wall to give the Zips a 4-3 lead

The score remained the same ‘til
the bottom of the fourth when Brad
Reese’s RBI groundout to third
scored Curt Allen, who, with one
out, had driven a curveball to the
gap in right center for a triple.

Akron remained scoreless for the
remainder of the game, but the
Panthers had just begun to warm
up.

After a pair of walks to Ciawley
and catcher Pat Walsh to laid off the
fifth inning, Lardo’s tomahawk blast
on a chin—high pitch over the
“Panther Pitt” in left made the score
7-4 and unoﬂicially ended the game.

“That’s not ideally the pitch I really
want to swing at,” Lardo said. “That
was a little bit too high. A little
something up in the letters is nice
but that wasn’t a nomial pitch selec-
tion.”

Pitt remained hot in the inning,
scoring three additional runs. After
Jason Roth's ﬂyout, Ken Strich
walked and was moved to second
on an error by Akron third baseman
E.J. Heckert. Kurt Allen followed
with a single, scoring pinch-runner
Brian Henne. Reese was hit by
Akron pitcher Glenn Ryan’s last
pitch — Ryan was promptly
removed — to bring up a Danny
Gonzalez. New Zip pitcher Jay
Stoner walked Gonzalez to force in
Tyler and gave up a sacrifice ﬂy to
Crawley, which scored Allen for the
Panthers’ final run of the game.

Despite only eight hits, the
Panthers managed to pound out 10
runs, a testament to timely hitting.

“The difference IS when you get
the hits, not how many hits you get,”
a prophetic Lardo said. “You get
some walks, you get some people
on base — that’s what its all about
A couple of games this year we had
problems where we had a lot of hits
but we wouldn’t score a lot of
