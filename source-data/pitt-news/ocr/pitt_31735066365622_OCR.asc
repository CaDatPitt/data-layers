Next  head seeks

solitlarity, free movies.

by SUE HOENSTINE
_ If nothing else, Tom Bailey, new-

ly elected Student Government‘

Board president wants to put an
end to the annual reorganization
of Student Government.

' j "‘I’m-interested in making this

   

'  to work together well to get things
I  I. . ﬂy  .

I constitution work to build a func-

tioning Student Government so
students know exactly what Stu-
dent Government policies are,”
Bailey explained. "I want the stu-

dents to know that one day they:

won’t go in and vote on a referen-
dum and the next day have a new

constitution.”

‘The. blond-haired . junior likes
"towork with people” and attri-
buted his election to personal con-
tacts. “I must have gotten five
hours of sleep every night during
the campaign. The rest of the time
I spent on campus meeting new
people,” he remarked.

But Bailey’s hectic pre-election
schedule may have, served as
training period for the enthused
Student Government head. “I’m
afraid that my free time has be-
come a thing of the past,” Bailey
continued as he explained that
health care and free movies from

student activity ‘fees are among

his goals.

Questioning the mandatory
health insurance fees for resident

‘ students, Bailey said, “I want to

see the term ‘mandatory’ cut out
of the health policy for dorm resi-
dents. And I would like to see part
of the student Activities Fee turn-
ed to providing health care.”

Bailey reasoned. "We have a lot
of money to work with and Student

Health helps a lot more people ,-
" than some smaller organizations.

We should try to make the care
free to students, at least those
covered with insurance. It seems
absurd that the health insurance
doesn't cover the bulk of injuries
and illnesses.”

Uniting the Franklin Pangborn
Film Club with the Student Gov-
ernment to provide free films for
all students is another project of
the president-designate. “I think
that Pangborn wants to been its
own, but I want to see the SG al-
locating all the funds for Pang-
born,” Bailey said. “I don’t want
them to be separate.”

Bailey, who plans to meet for at
least an hour every week with
members of the Board is optimis-
tic about their ability to cooper-
ate. "We have no personality con-
flicts and so Isthink we'll be able

  

 -represent the student body." ~

Bailey, a self-proclaimed “jock,”
is proud that "there is not one in-
tramural sport that I haven’t par-
ticipated in for three years.”

After dislocating both shoulders
while wrestling during his fresh-
man year, Bailey joined the Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity “since the
fraternities have the best intra-
mural athletics."

But Bailey disclaims any favor-
itism to campus Greeks, although
he and the members of his Board
are fraternity and sorority mem-
bers. “For anyone that thinks that
we’re putting all we have into
Greek .-Week it’s impossible since

the concerts are already booked. .,
. Besides I don’t think there are any -
. Greeks involved that are going to

carry their interests to Student
Government.”

BAILEY -
Free Time Gone

The fact that entertainment and
speakers were already planned by
the outgoing commissioners is a
convenience to Bailey. But he is
considering rescheduling Student
Government terms to run from
April to April.

Also, Bailey does not expect a
salary, although his predecessors
were recently paid for their serv-
ices to the University. “I’ve been
against salaries for Student Gov-
ernment people since the issue
came up,” he commented.

Relieved that he “will have no
more power than the members of
the Board." the new SG president
seems anxious to begin working
with students and administrators.
"I think the administration is

pleased with the election results. ‘

maybe because we're new." he
said. "and maybe because‘ they
need a Vfigurehead. -someone to

Absentee votes pending

  Fresh Studies okayed

by GLENDA MINSHULL

-. \The Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved the
Freshman Studies Program Saturday by a vote of

_ 78-51.

their votes yet. ‘

, Dr. Jerome Rosenberg. dean of the FAS. said
that the official vote count should be available by

the first week of February...

If the proposal receives the necessary major-
ity for‘ passage, freshmen en_tering Pitt next fall will
be able to select“ from four different types of
courses; standard courses, similar to the type cur-L‘

‘ rently offered; team-taught inter-disciplinary
courses; special seminars open only to freshmen,‘
or the Alternative Curriculum (AC). _ v

AC wou'ld consist .of 12 groupslof-".20 fresh-
menstudents’ with each group having, a-faculty tu-
tor. Students would receive 15 credits for each term
of AC taken, with the option of ‘taking up to two‘ reg-
ular courses as part of the AC program.

The proposal provides forcontinuing evaluation

\ through the Office of Measurement and Evaluation.

Three hours of discussion and debate preceded

the vote. Much of the disagreement centered around

the need ‘for the*degree of commitment that the
proposal demands from the faculty. \

Dr. Jerome Schneewind, dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences. told the faculty that Pitt wa3’not
able to attract a" high caliber of students because of
its limited undergraduateprograms. . j , M ‘

However. the vote is not final. because 56' mem-
bers of the Facultyxof Arts-and Sciences _(FAS) who
had asked to vote by absentee ballot have not cast

proposal.

, L.

“If we are to attract a student body of a special.
kind. then we will have to develop a special kind of, A '
curriculum," he said.

The proposal also weathered strong criticism
"from faculty members who feared that the addition-‘ - '
al emphasis on undergraduate programs would de-
tract from the University's graduate programs.
Others, remembering the passage of Black Studies -
and. Women’s Studies programs, were loath to at- V -
taeh primary importance to Freshman Studies.

.Ho_wever, proponents of the program assured
that"none of these programs would be successful
unless the faculty was willing to begin at the root
the freshman, bored and unexcited about programs
currently offered.

Financing of the program evoked strong debate. In
light of the University's financial squeeze, many
feared that existing departmental programs would

i be eliminated to meet the Freshman Studies budget. ; .
Their ideas were incorporated into an amendment 
to the proposal that identified the financial respon- ’ '

- sibilities of the University in

A second amendment, introduced by Dr. Sam- 
_ uel Hays of the History Department, calling for _ex-  - 
pansion of instructional material in the libraryto 
meet the needs of students involved in the program
, passed unanimously. ’

A plan similar to the proposal, the so-called *
Prologue Program, was defeated by the FAS last
January. The Freshman Studies Proposal, evolved .

. after the defeat of the Prologue Program, has been _ V"
the subject of much debate and was recently amend- .'
ed,-by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Council.

Council adivoeates credit by exam

_ by VICKI T_UTIN
The credit by examination program was the

main topic of discussion at the‘College of Arts and"

‘Sciences Council meeting Friday.

According to Dr. Jerome-Schneewind. dean of
the College (CAS), "There has long been a rule to
the effect that any student could take a course by
examination,” However. statistics reveal that few
students, have availed themselvesvof this opportun-

ity. ‘ ' . I . _ . _
‘The goal _of the CAS Council, said Schneewind.‘

is to informithe students of this possibility in order‘
to increase enrollment in the program. T

I To this end,‘ Schneewind" has contacted Univer-
sity departments inquiring as to what courses are
advisable for the program. Reported responses

. ranged from “no courses” to “any courses.”

Si'nce'at the present departments have no pow-
er to exclude any student. who -wishes \to“parti_c,i-
pate. the Council is setting up a tentative set of rules

I "trying, in part, to give“ the departments some au-

stated. “The creditby examination program is an
excellent idea. It allows people toxattain _credit for
courses in which they’ve already acquired skill and
knowledge." ‘ ’

He said he could envisage certain exceptions,
I for instance, in some research or discussion-orient-

ed courses.

‘_‘With a total of 60 credits permis si.ble on this’

program, said Schneewind, "Pitt may be able to
recruit more bright high school graduates, who may
achieve credit for advanced courses they’ve taken

_ while in high school,-’.’ he said.

In addition,‘ a student must pay‘ only $20 for_a
course which otherwise would be far more expen-
sive and time-consuming. ‘

Speaking in future-oriented terms, Schneewind

suggested that ithis" program .“may cut down the .

size of large undergraduateclasses.”'
Recruitment for the Provost’s Advisory Com-

, mittee on Undergraduate Programs also occupied

the CAS Council- Three facultyand three student
memberswill be drawn from each of the CAS, the
Nursing School, andthe School of Education. Sug-
gestions for membership were elicited.

Accordingto Schneewind. "The Committee will

I advise the Provost on important’ policy questions

for undergraduate study in the future. such as inter-
school programs and external degrees.”

Local and county officials

noted that while such a charter

it could not create

subject to state legislation.

trial and will be tried "separ-
ately and at a later date."
When the defendant asked Her-
man for his reasons for the
severance, the judge replied
that he did not need to give
any reasons at this time.

This bizarre trial actually be-
gan in November, 1970, when

FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, -

while testifying before a closed
Senate Appropriations sub-com-
mittee in behalf of his request
for increased funds, accused the
Berrigan brothers (both of whom
were in jail at the time for de-
struction of draft files), of mas-
terminding a plot to kidnap a
high government official to hold
for ransom against an end to
bombing in Southeast Asia,
and a plot to blow up under-
ground heating systems in
Washington.

When the Senate subcommit-
tee released Hoover’s statement.
the Berrigans flatly denied the
accusation and told Hoover to
retract his statement or prove
the alleged conspiracy. The fol-

lowing January, a Federal grand_

jury meeting in Harrisburg
indicted six alleged conspira-
tors and named seven others as
unindicted co-conspirators.

A second indictment was hand-
ed down in April which added
two defendants and dropped
three of the co-conspirators, and
which also made the charges of
conspiracy to destroy draft files
the primary focus of the govern-
ment’s case, rather than the kid-
napping and bombing charges.

The second. indictment in-

cludes such broad charges as.
conspiracy to "commit offenses "

against the United States." The
government put the kidnap-
ping and bombing charges
under a different statute. which
reduces ' the maximum penalty
from life imprisonment to five
years.

The three main trial lawyers
for the defense are ‘Ramsey
Clark. former U. S. Attorney
General, Paul O'Dwyer, a pro-
minent New York attorney and
former Senatorial candidate,
and Leonard Boudin, an expert
on consoiracv laws who has de-

fended numerous radical left-
ists including many subjected
to the McCarthy
the fifties.

Until Glick was severed from
the trial last week. he was the
one defendant who was going to
defend himself. This strategy
was based on the desire of the
defendants to do two things in
the course of the trial: 1) to in-
troduce the political issues from
which the trial is an outgrowth,
specifically the war in Indo-
china and government credi-
bility; and 2) to attempt to hu-
manize the courtroom situation,
hopefully relating to the jury
witnesses, prosecutors, judge,
and each other in the most hu-
man way possible.

Glick remarked after the sever-
ance ruling last week that it
seems obvious that the govern-
ment fears his self- defense.

The defendants and Defense
Committee staff in Harrisburg
are interested in relating to the
local community throughout the
trial. The defendants. lawvers.

inquiries _in -

and staff have rented three
houses and two apartments, all
located in lower income sections
of the city, and are living col-
lectively in these homes during
the trial. ‘

A couple weeks ago they had
an open house and invited the

Harrisburg citizenry into these’_

homes. The response was quite
favorable considering the con-
servative character of the com-
munity. CBS did a filming and
some of. the defendants. lawyers,
and staff were on hand to rap
with the people.

The defendants and the
various Defense Committees
across the nation consider this
trial an important event not
only because it will decide
whether or not seven or eight
people will go to jail, not only
because it will challenge the
constitutionality of the con-
spiracy laws, but more import-
antly because it will once again
focus public attention on the
immorality and brutality of the
continued American presence in
Indochina.

 
 

7 Academic Excellence: a dream revisited\

  

\As one admissions officer cynically remarked,

by CARL VAN HORN

Countless resolutions, statements of intent, and_ pro-
mises for the future have been made on the issue of
academic excellence at this University. Yet if the cur-
rent trends continue, this institution may become, by
default, a second class community college.

A recent report in the University Times brought

I « the ‘happy’ news that the mean Scholastic Aptitude

Test scores have dropped over the last three years in
the College of Arts and Sciences. Among the many
distraught faculty members, one was heard to say,
"Even with all the careats about people having trouble
on such tests and the like, a decline in 600 points on
the average in the verbal scores (now at a 510 aver-
age) is disastrous.“

Curiously, however. the mean Quality Point Aver-
age of students in the college is up from 2.55 in 1970
to 2.75 in 1971. Fewer students have left or been dis-
missed from the University for academic reasons these
last three years than anyone can remember.

The rise in "academic performance“ as measured
by the Q.P.A. is probably not a result of the increas-

' ing excellence of the student body. While both faculty
‘ and administrators choose to deny or suppress it, the
. number of so-called “cake" courses is on the increase

(go to class and you get an A; don’t go andyou get
a B). A judicious selection of courses of this ilk,
along with the careful use of the credit/no entry card
will earn the uninterested and lax a cum laude cita-
tion, and perhaps even a 4.00 after four years.

With fewer studentsyleaving, the uperclass course
size has increased noticeably and all students, especi-
ally those who need additional attention and want it,
will suffer.

“Most of the battle takes place at the admissions point,

once you’re in you’ve got it made.” And even ‘getting
in’ is not that tough. Five out of every six applicants
are admitted. f ’

And to pour salt on an already wounded insti-
tution. the composition of that freshman class is be-
coming increasingly local. Approximately 60 percent
come from Allegheny County and the out-of-state e_n—
rollment had dropped from 30 percent, in 1965 to
around 8 percent in 1970. »A heterogeneous student
body is vital for the productive exchange of values
and ideas. ‘

This dismal state of affairs could quickly lead to a
decline in the overall reputation of the University, es-
pecially its undergraduate college. '

Meanwhile, cliches abound. In a recent statement,
Chancellor Posvar comments on the newlfund-raising
campaign: "These funds will provide the essential
impulse in elevating a number of excellent University
programs ‘to the level of national greatness in teaching,
research, or public service.”

Characteristically, al. bricks-and-mortar philosophy_

has been held by educators of the ‘50’s and ‘60’s, but
in the current economy an attitude of frugality has
emerged in Government and the public mind. Even
if the money is raised, lovely buildings cannot check
the problem of poorly’ qualified students and lenient
faculty.

A perceived decline in the University’s-academic
excellence could also result in a serious.’ faculty
exodus, and furtherexacerbate the problems of De-
partment Chairmen in recruiting replacements. Fur-
thermore, the. Pitt Admissions Office would be unable
to successfully recruit good high schoolers and the
quality of the freshman class wouldplumme.teven‘fur-
ther;., the result—a decli_‘ne‘in the quality of .education-

teaching, research and public service.

It is hoped that wiser men than I will recognize
these trends and begin to act upon them. Rather than
pick out targets for verbal abuse, an easy path to
follow, I will suggest several areas and staffs of the
University that 'should look long and hard at these
developments. Specific implementations must be left
to them.

The faculty as a group can begin at the grass-
roots level by displaying ‘more care in, their course
grading systems. What is needed here is not an intru-
sion into the “sacred cow” of academic freedom, but
the emergence, of anew spirit of academic integrity
which is sorely lacking in some Departments.

The Department Chairmen have the prerogative
and the right, in my opinion, to interfere in matters
which affect the academic integrity of the Depart-
ments and the institution. And where Chairmen are
lacking in courage or support, the Dean should assist.

At another level, the Provost, who is specifically
charged with maintaining the excellence of academics
and developing better programs should exert a more
direct influence. And finally the Chancellor, who is

ultimately accountable for the health and well-being,

of the institution, academically_ and financially, must
assume a more active overall posture.

‘ I charge these people (if the shoe‘ fits) with this,
task, and suggest that haste is not inappropriate. Eager
state legislators are ready and willing to intrude in
the University’s affairs . . . in ‘such areas as faculty

"productivity, for example. We mu'st avoid su

ch a catas- I '

Lococo debuts
in noon series

by DAVE KOLAKOSKI

The MusicDepartment‘s Thurs-
day noon series featured pianist
Charles Lococo as its initial
artist. The part-time faculty
member’s dramatic performance
was marred at times by sloppy
technique, perhaps because the
entire program, which was dif-
ficult. was performed totally

Mozart’s Fantasy in C Minor.
was played movingly; but with
a slight lack of the early classi-
cal restrain_t one would expect
in such a piece. The most notice-
able technical failure occurred
when the final cadenza faltered
toward its climax, leaving us
unsatisfied.

At this point, many individu-
als who had arrived late and
were listening in the hall found
seats, as a few who had been
there since the beginning, left.
As a result, they missed the
brightest moment of the after-
noon’s concert.

Combining dazzling virtu-
osity with dramatic intensity,
his rendition of the allegro con
brio of Beethoven’s Sonata in
ClMajor left us limp, yet musi-
cally pleased.

Lococo amply demonstrated
his versatility as he closed with
Ondine (from Gaspard de. la
Nuit) by Ravel. The audience
was treated to a sensitive por-
trayal of Ravel’s delicate har-
monies and melody. Lococo dis-
played a fine talent, at times
overreached, but certainly well
worth hearing. '

Eritiasé ’ c/mitt ‘élzzir is’ Knee

'1 by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

There is,I think, a tendency
on the part of film critics to
cherish obscurity in films. to
pretend that the critic is privy
to some special knowledge that.
in his best English detective-
during —_the — final — page — de-
nouement manner, he will un-
veil to his befuddled audience.

This lust_ for intricacy stems
not only from the snobbish be-
lief that the masses just don’t
understand, but it is in a real
sense a justification for the
critics_ role as critic. For unless
he -helps viewers understand
films, ‘_ what is he doing but
showing off? (After all, who
needs Walt Disney explained
to him?)

So it is only mildly surprising
that Clair’s Knee, now at the
Shadyside, is being hailed ‘as
"art," or a “work of genius.”

The National Society of Film
Critics named Clair’s Knee the
best film of 1971. I haven‘t
the vaguest idea why... unless it
is because of the critics‘ passion
for puzzles.

“Clair’s Knee” is
“Clair’s Knee” is intricate.
“Clair’s Knee” is also a preten-
tious bore of a film that dab-
bles with a few potentially
strong ideas and bu.ries them
in listless direction and dreary
screenplay.

Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy)
and Aurora (Aurora Cornu) are
cynics whose spiritual nihilism
has led them along different

courses: his to gentle hedonism,'

hers to self-denial. Both, be-
cause they believe in nothing

or at least believe they believe 2

in nothing, lack any spontaneity
or zest for life. '.

Deficient .in those qualities.
they invent little artifices to test

obscure.

life. A writer. Aurora suggests
that Jerome have an affair with
a precocious 16-year old. from
which he. will gain some modi-
cum of pleasure and she will
have something to write about.

One of their arbitrary chal-
lenges is Clair’s knee (Clair is
another teenager). which Jerome
swears he must stroke. Why. you
may ask, does he want to do
that? He doesn’t really know.
Jerome mumbles some gibberish
about being weighed down by
the burden of uselessness, about
how touching Clair‘s knee is an
act of pure will. but it in the
end is only a game that he and
Aurora have invented.

Brialy and Cornu must be
given credit for their perform-
ances, since it is difficult to
act like people who. are acting
and not get swallowed.

by MARK SIGMON

‘ Nine 9 thousand wrestling fans hummed with
excitement-.in anticipation of the‘ 126 pound
championship -bout. betweenv defending NCAA
titlist Dwayne Keller (Oklahoma State) and Pitt
freshman Randy Payne. Eight minutes later. fol-
lowing a rather listless performance. Payne

. walkedoff the mata 8-0 loser. - A -

That was- nearly two years ago. Randy has
been defeated‘ only once ' since. a 7-5 thriller
this past December to Michigan‘s Billy Davids.

"I was really lucky to make the national’
, finals as a freshman.” Payne reminisced. "I got a

good break in th_e draw. Regarding the loss to
Michigan, that’s the way" things happen. No ex-
cuses." ‘ ’

. Throughout‘ his - distinguished mat career, '
Payne has never had to make any excuses for his_

sparkling, achievements. A two-time New York
state champ, Randy was 109-1 as a high schooler.
Hisonly loss came at the hands of Pitt’s Steve
Weiss in 1967.

Randy’s -freshman year at Pitt was one of suc-

cess and‘ complexity. After capturing the».126 pound
division at the Navy Plebe Tournament. in addi-
ion to being. named the tourney‘s most outstanding
grappler. Payne went on to become the 1970
NCAA runnerup. Prior to his lossto Keller. Randy
defeated the 1970 NCAA small college titlist. the

Eastern champ. and the Eastern second-place.

finisher,

Nevertheless. due to a dubious interpretation of
the newly instituted freshman eligibility rule.
Payne could only compete in five varsity duals.
and not the EIWA tournament. That ruling has
finally been rescinded. ‘

Hounded by a troublesome shoulder all three
seasons at Pitt, Payne is now in good physical
shape. However», ‘he still refusesto predict his

chances of winning an Eastern of NCAA title in’

1972. _ -

of that high caliber. Heck, even in the East,’ it’s ’

tough."

_ The matmen, after a poor start. have come on .
strong, winning their last three dual meets by
whooping scores. Randy credits the squad’s im-
provement to togetherness. . . . .

‘-‘Every guy on this team is like a brother to
me,” explained Payne.’ “‘We’re helping each other
all the timein practice. This‘ team is made up of

real people, not 'jocks.'I also want to‘ give "credit

to our two co-captains .(Dave Wylie,‘ and Willie.
Saloky), especially Wylie. Dave is a great guy.

.He’s doing one helluva job.”

_.,_,.not a’: week. w ‘

To the dismay and astonishment of many
Pitt wrestling followers, Payne dropped out of
school last winter after the Pitt-Michigan match.

‘ "People _think'you‘re a-superman when they
know you’re an athlete." said Payne. “The pres-
sure was :just too much last January. Weekly_
wrestle-offs in practice and classes helped make
my decision.‘ I went _traveling and it was _a good
relaxer. - ‘ K v '

“Sometimes people come up/to Ihe_'and ask why
I didn’t ‘give my all’ in"a certain bout? Wrestling

_ is a sport, not a business. When I’m’on the mat,
, I’m there to have fun. Sure, I want to win, but if

I can’t enjoy it, that’s ridiculous.” .
Payne was one of three New York State
champs recruited by Coach .Dave Adams in 1969.
Scott Ross. who won the Navy Plebe Tournament
at 142 in 1970. has since transferred to Cornell.
Weiss. also a Plebe titlist. has been struck by
two cri_ppling knee injuries. i 4 . » '
All three grapplers. especially Randy. could
