Professors plan for possible G—20 school closing

University officials say they still don’t
know whether Pittwill remain open
during the G—20 Summit, which will‘,
take place two weeks from now. Some

’ professors, reluctant to await word

from admin-
istrators, are
devising their

cope with the
event and the

 

and Carlow universities, among other

places, have cancelled classes.

“For any political events, students
are always informed whenever pos-
sible, and they can choose to partici-
pate on whatever level they wish,” he

said. “While I feel civic involvement -

on any level is everyone’s responsibil-
ity, I urge students to actively partici-
pate in ongoing
political cam-
paigns to learn
the mechanics
of [them] .”

disclosing its plans for it — as an in-
convenience, others also see the G—20
as a unique learning opportunity.
Gerald Shuster, avisiting lecturer
in Pitt’s communication department,
plans to offer extra credit to some of
his students participating inthe Sum-
mit, for which the Pittsburgh public
schools, Duquesne, Robert Morris

said he’ll give
extra credit to students covering the
Summit as members of the media or
to students involved in the local plan-
ning of the Summit.

“While I would not oppose any
student’s participation in protesting
the event, given the nature of my class
and its objectives, doing so would not
merit extra credit,” he said. -

Pitt history professor Tony Novo-
sel said he hopes to hold class during
the Summit, but he’s making a video
podcast ofhis lecture as a precaution.

_ hours Saturday clean-

G—20.

But she doesn’t know why.

“The G—20 is in two weeks.
People will keep throwing sh*t
down,” Koudelka, a Pitt student,
said.

Koudelka was one of more
than 1,000 people who helped
clean up the streets in 15 Pitts-
burgh neighborhoods, including
Oakland, Shadyside, the North
Shore and West Liberty Avenue
this weekend. ’

About 130 people volunteered
to help in Oakland, a neighbor-
hood known for hosting a few col-

’ lege parties on the weekends.

Last week, Mayor Luke Ra-

Pittsburgh residents to volunteer
for a series of beautiﬁcation proj-

Downtown businesses fear G—2O impact, Oakland businesses excited

Simone Cheatham
Staff Writer

With the G-20 Summit in just two
weeks, some Oakland restaurant
owners said they are hoping for a
boom in business.

But Downtown, where tight secu-
rity restrictions will be in place and
protesters are expected to show up en
masse, entrepreneurs said they fear
they’ll lose money and more.

Business at Pamela’s Diner has
been great since President Barack

Obama expressed a fondness for its
pancakes inApril, accordingto Tim,
one ofthe store’s owners. He declined
to give his last name because he said
he doesn’t feel comfortable in the
public eye.

Tim said he expects things to be
no different when the G—20, a group
of leaders representing 19 countries
and the EU, comes to Pittsburgh
Sept. 24 and 25 to discuss the world
economy. '

“I’ve already talked to some
people Downtown who are getting
bookings [for hotels]. I’m sure Oak-

land is getting some bookings, too,”
he said. “We keep hearing horror
stories about this thing on the news.

 

We’re not even sure
if We’re going to stay
open at this point

Marc Matus

We’re just hopingthat it goes withou
ahitch.” —

Marc Matus, an assistant man-
ager at Pizza Sola on Atwood Street,
said he thinks business could be
great during the G-20, but that will
all depend on whether Pitt cancels
classes, he said.

/ “We’re not even sure if we’re go-
ingto stay open at this point,” Matus
said. “Ifschool is canceled, we’ll prob-
ably be closed, too. Saleswillbe either
more or less. It just depends on how
many people are around.”

But business owners Downtown

seemto be moreﬂusteredbythe Sum-
mit, which is expected to auract more
than 3,500 journalists alone, inaddi—
tion to the diplomats, their spouses
and thousands of protesters.

One Downtown business owner,
who asked to remain anonymous be-
cause he feared beingtargeted by city
officials and protesters, said he be-
lieves the Summitwill have “nothing
but negative” -effects on Downtown
businesses.

“Oh, it’ll beneﬁt the politicians
and most of the people in big federal

jobs,” he said. “But the beneﬁts for the

“That means that if we have class, the
video podcastwill supplement, and if
it is canceled, we have class taken care
of,” he said. A

Assistant professor Roberta
Hatcher plans to make her evening
class optional Thursday, Sept. 24, and
to arrange for students to make up
the work.

“If I do determine that access will
be difficult enough to merit cancel-
ingclass, I will do so shortly before
and announce it to students by e—mail
and by posting the cancellation by an
agreed time on the class Courseweb
site,” she said.

Hatcher said she’s chosen this ap-
proach because she, like most other
people in the city, doesn’t know what
security measures will be in place dur-
ing the Summit. _

She also said she “anticipates that
students might want to be involved
in various ways in this historic event,
whetherasvolunteers, demonstrators
or as student reporters.”

Despite traffic delays, detours and

closings, some professors say a stu-
dent’s interest in the event merits lax
requirements during the week of the
Summit.

Meanwhile, University administra-
tors don’t seem to know for sure when
they’ll decide whether the University
will remain open for the Sept. 24-25
summit.

Chancellor Mark N ordenberg said
in a news release that the University’s
“general approachwill be to maintain
operations that are as close to normal
as possible” and that the University
will disclose its plans for the Summit
this week.

Butwhen asked about rumors that
the University was waiting until after

the White House holds an informa- I

tional meeting today to decide about
the Summit’s security operations, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said he wasn’t
sure when the University would release

4 its plans and that he’s heard nothing

about this “oﬂicial statement” from
the White House. »

city are at a minimum.”
V He said his store bought special

G-20 merchandise to sell during the

Summit, but he plans on taking a ma-

jor loss in sales, because there are ru-

mors that violent protests will occur
that week, and security restrictions

will prohibit unauthorized people
from driving within three blocks of
the David Lawrence Convention Cen-

ter, which will host the Summit. ’

“I don’t know how much it’ll cost
us, but business is terrible already
with this economy,” he said. “This is
goingto be amajorblowto us. There’s
no plus side to this. September has
been a pretty good month for us in
the past, but most of that week we’ll
lose. Business will "be terrible, and
there will be some violence. If you
know anyone who’s willing to bet on
this, I’ll seriously put some money
down oni ” — _

The owner said if the city permits
it, he hopesto stay open for extended
hours to try to earn more revenue.

The store normally operates from

10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

Local business organizations, in-
cluding the Pittsburgh Downtown
Partnership and PPG Manage-
ment, have posted basic guidelines
for businesses to follow during the

Students cash in

good grades  

Those Advanced Placement (AP)
classes you took in high school
meant two things: no senioritis
for you and, if you studied hard
and received a passing grade on
the exam, free college credits. But
now, imagine that you could’ve re-

ceived cash-money for achieving

that passing grade. Under a New
York City—based program, some

i students can.

REACH, or Rewarding Achieve-

ment, is a program that offers A

with a 4 who attended sessions
will receive $750.

Using monetary incentives
to motivate students’ academic
achievement remains a conten-
tious notion, however. We’ve all
had those professors who insist it’s
not the grade that’s important, but
what you learn that really matters.
They’d say students should appreci-
ate learning for the sake of learning
and that their motives should not
be clouded by things like padding

rewards, the funds can help pay
for college.

Earning college credit is a key-
note reason to enroll in AP classes.
Earning college credits in high
schools means one — sometimes
two or three — less classes to worry
about ﬁtting in your schedule. But
passing AP scores offer more than
just relief from general education

requirements. They save money,.

too. The less classes a student takes
while enrolled at college, the less
money he’ll have

to pay for tuition.

Why Republicans fear Medicare cuts, rationing

Lewis Lehe ,.

Columnist

One of the horrible things about
U.S. public schools is that they
will not buy students any knee
replacements.

No one likes to talk about it,
but it’s true. That is one of the
things we never thought about
when we created the public school
system — that the principals
would have life-and-death pow-
er over our children’s health and
that in every case, the principals
would choose death.

OK, I admit this is silly. There’s
nothing socialist or prying about
a public school not paying for a
medical treatment. A politi-
cian who advocated that public
schools pay for students’ health
care would be called liberal. Her
conservative opponent would
say, “Government is expensive
enough!”

But is it any more socialist
when a public health insurer
doesn’t pay for something than
when a public school doesn’t
P33’?

The Republicans have been
chilling the public’s blood with
a story as horrific and false as
anything told around a campﬁre:
Since President.Barack Obama’s

health plan depends on stricter S

rationing for the people who have
government health insurance, the
government will have more con-
trol over our lives.

Rationing simply means that
the government won’t pay for cer-
tain procedures.

Is that so meddling? In or-
der for us to "call it “meddling,”
doesn’t the government have to
actually stop people from buying
something? Or is just refusing to
pay enough?

It is a sad day when people
can’t distinguish “not receiving
something for free” from “not be-
ing allowed to have something.”

Obama simply wants Medicare, I

the government health insurance
that covers all senior citizens, to
ration our tax dollars based on
decisions made by panels using
cost-effectiveness data.

These panels are the basis for
the “death panels” that Sarah
Palin is afraid will kill her chil-
dren. " ‘

Palin’s fears are overblown,
but it is possible that Medicare
will make decisions that let some
people die when their conditions
are costly to treat and their life
expectancy would be low with the
treatment, anyway.

It sounds bad, but surely there
is a limit to the amount of tax dol-
lars we are willing to spend on

someone’s health care. New, more

expensive procedures come out
every day. If the alternative to

’ rationing is paying for whatever

new procedure could conceivably
yield social beneﬁt, the govern-
ment will go the way of Lehman
Brothers, which paid, for any
mortgage that could conceivably

receive $1,000, while a student wasted, and given the triple-digit actually learn something. Lehe > 5

' yield a proﬁt.

But the weird thing is that it’s Republi-
cans who are up in arms about these cuts
in spending. I

V Normally, they would endorse cutsto

any agency except the military. Why do

the Republicans feel health care for the
elderly is a cause for which taxpayers can
spare no expense? ‘

I believe it is a case of guilt by associa-
tion.

Rationing is something that countries

with socialized medicine inevitably have to '

do, or go bankrupt. And because Republi-
cans are against socialized medicine, they
are against rationing. What Republicans

_don’t recognize is that we already have

socialized medicine for our elderly.

So, by ignoring the fact, we are choos-
ing the bankruptcy option, not avoiding
the choice. g

Of course, Obama doesn’t just advocate
rationing for its own sake. He wants to use
the savings from Medicare rationing to
cover more of the uninsured.

But this aspect of Obama’s plan shouldn’t
really divide liberals and conservatives.
Their divide revolves on the question, “Will
we have bigger or smaller government?”

But here we are talking about a ﬁxed
amount of money that we can push around
the budget. So the rationing debate re-
volves on the question, “Will the govern-
ment buy unlimited coverage for a few
people or more basic coverage for many
people?”

Rationing isn’t the only, or even the
primary, source of money for Obama’s plan
to expand coverage, though. He also wants

_ to raise taxes, to pick up the slack left over

from rationing.

So, in a sense, wecan draw two spec-
tra: One spectrum is, “How much does
the government spend on old people vs.
other people?” On another spectrum is,
“How much will the government spend
overall?” 1 . ~

The two questions do not have to be
related. A Republican can oppose tax hikes
but still support expanding a very basic lev-
el of coverage to all Americans —— paid for
with savings from rationing Medicare.

Eventually, a health plan will pass.

But if Republicans use all their force
to oppose only the rationing aspect of
health care reform, then we will receive
an abominable compromise that should
be Republicans’ worst nightmare: a plan

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

The Sept. 10 editorial,
“Speech unveils lofty, noble
ideals” praised Obama’s health
care reform plan. I implore
The Pitt News to reconsider
its view.

Over the summer, Obama
moved from a radical single-
payer system ofhealth care to a
systemthat includes “coopera-
tives to compete with private
insurers, ratherthan establish-
ing a taxpayer—backed public

plan.”However, what is the dif-
ference between both? There
isn’t one. Currently, there is
no government regulation or
barrier in creating health care
cooperatives. So, why is there
such urgency for the govern-
ment to create one now?
Some liberals feel that peo-
ple have an inalienable right
to health care. In fact, liberal
senators compared the right
to health care to'the right that
every human should have
electricity and running water.

I never asked my neighbor to
pay for my electricity or run-
ning water, so why should I
have to pay for his health care
coverage? ‘

This plan is simply not
methodological, holistic or
balanced. The current health
care planwillcreate signiﬁcant
problems in the long run, just
like Medicaid.

‘ 9 ’ lacks significant plot , characterization

Despite stunning animation and special effects, “9” is riddled with ambiguity

Andres Miguel
Staﬂ” Writer

“9”

Elijah Wood,_]ennifer Connelly,
Christopher Plummer (voices)
Directed by Shane Acker, Pro-
duced by Tim Burton -

Focus Features

D

Rarely has the term “arbitrary”
applied so aptly to a ﬁlm than to
Shane Acker’s animated feature-
length debut, “9.”

  

“9,” set in a “Terminator”-A
esque post-apocalyptic future,
where machines have appar-
ently destroyed humanity, fol-
lows 9 (Voice of Elijah Wood), a
small burlap doll with a hearty
dose of gumption, as he awak-
ens without knowledge of what
happened to society or why he
exists. He quickly meets up with
his eight burlap compatriots --
appropriately named 1 through
8, of course —- who have divided
themselves into factions over how
to survive the lingering threat of
the machines.

 

1 (voice of Christopher Plum-
mer) leads a contingent hiding
away in a dilapidated cathedral,
the group hoping the machine
threat will fade away with time,
while 7 (voice ofjennifer Connel-
ly) heads a brigade that believes
in a proactive effort. As the ﬁlm
progresses, the factions predict-

ably collide and have to come to '

a compromise to survive.
Unfortunately, “9” does not go
far beyond this bare—bones de-
scription in terms of plot. Never
are any relevant questions an-
swered — such as what the char-

  

acters’ purposes are. Instead, Ack-
er ﬁlls this void plot with stylized
and overwrought action scenes,
archetypal characterization and a
bloated special effects budget.
While Hollywood is no’strang-
er to 20-minute on—screen battles,
albeit in this case between burlap

-homunculi and ragtag robots, at
79 minutes “9’? -does not have 20-

minutes to waste —— and there are
multiple such scenes in this empty
shell of a ﬁlm.

On the other hand, the visuals
are breathtaking. Every frame of
“9” is deeply infused with Acker’s
(clearly Burton-inﬂuenced)

wasteland, which teeters
precariously between dark
miasma and banal wonder.
Wood and the rest of the voice
A cast performs admirably,
even though the presence of
Connelly as the single female-
coded character. raises a num-
ber of additional questions
that never get answered.
However, these superﬁci-
alities, while perfect down to
the last detail, fail to breathe
life into “9.” Acker’s previous

Courtesy Focus Features work was in short ﬁlm (“The

Grenade,” “The Hangnail”)

vision of a post-apocalyptic '

and it shows —— his debut feels
like a short ﬁlm concept that, un-
surprisingly, fails when stretched
out to a feature-length running
time. Even at slightly more than
an hour, “9” drags on as it be-
comes clear that, beyond simply
not getting answers to any of
the important questions in the
ﬁlm, noone —— not even Acker —
knows what those answers are.
In particular, the ﬁ1m’s ending is
incredibly unsatisfying — abrupt,
melodramatic and pointless.

There is certainly no require-
ment that a ﬁlmmaker answer ev-
ery question raised by his or her
work. Indeed, many of the great-
est ﬁlms in history leave burning
inquiries unresolved that serve to
enhance the viewer’s investment
in the ﬁlm, and such unanswered
questions etches the movie into
the viewer’s subconscious well
beyond running time.

However, “9” fails to answer
even the most basic queries about
the world and the characters Ack-
er has crafted.

Relying on stylistic overload,
“9” promotes an insurmountable
barrier to any kind of genuine
investment in the ﬁlm beyond
a bare respect for its technical
mastery.

‘Dorothy in Oz’ gets

new time,

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

Like Dorothy getting swept up by a
cyclone and being transplanted to
a new and exciting location, so will
the production of The Rage of the
Stage Players’ “Dorothy in Oz” ﬁnd
itself in a new place before its delayed
premiere on Thursday evening.

Formerly taking the stage at The
Brew House on Mary Street in the
South Side, the production will now
open at the Open Stage Theater on
Smallman Street, also in the South
Side.

According to The Brew House’s

Iocaﬂon

oiﬁcial website, the Brew House As-
sociation received a notice from the
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Build-
ing Inspection citing various code
violations, subsequently forcing the
“Dorothy” production to change ven-
ues two days before it was originally
slated to open. »

The play, which concerns a par-
ticularly twisted psychological take
on “The Wizard of Oz,” will run from
Sept. 17 to 19 and from Sept. 24 to
26. .

A news release from The Rage of
the Stage Players stated that the show
will not suffer from the last-minute
change, and audiences can still expect
a “dark/adult-oriented fairy tale.

Attn. Disney: It’sover!

Noah calls it quits with the multi—billion-dollar organization V

    

by Noah Levinson
Colum/ziat

 
 

Disney, quit playing games
with my heart.

This past week, Disney held
its first D23 Expo in Anaheim,
Calif. D23 began as an online
community created in Marchlby
Disney for the purpose of dis-
cussion and interaction between
extreme fans of the House of
Mouse.

The ‘,‘D” stands for Disney
and the “23” for_1923 — the
year Walt'Disney founded what

is now known as The Walt Dis-
ney Co.

While there’s nothing wrong
with all the Disney groupies
getting together, the D23 Expo
exempliﬁes once more how con-
ventions.like Comic-Con and
South by Southwest are con-
tinuously edging closer to the
mainstream and are being used
less as gatherings and more for
an advertising front.

But societal issues aside,
D23 actually sparked some al-
ternately exciting and depress-
ing news.

The expo started with an ap-
pearance byjohnny Depp, in full

Jack Sparrow garb, to announce .

the details for the fourth Pirates
movie, “Pirates of the Caribbe-
an: On Stranger Tide.”

A Shame on you, Disney, for re-

» using again and again what was

one fun film based off a theme
park ride.

You’ve abused the whole idea
so much that now it cries itself to
sleep and spontaneously throws
things when it’s alone.

But Disney won’t stop there
when it comes to remakes, se-
quels and theybasic tormenting
of my childhood.

Besides the sequel to “Tron”
and the remake of “Alice in Won-

derland” that Disney announced earlier-
this year, director Robert Zemeckis will
lead a 3-D remake of the 1968 Beatles
ﬂick, “Yellow Submarine.”

As if the original wasn’t trippy
enough.

And after the disaster of a Muppet
movie that was‘ “The Muppets’ Wizard
of Oz,” Disney will try again with “The
Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made.”

 —-But holdvon a second, something’s

wrong. Jason Segal will be writing the .

screenplay for it? The Jason Segal who
wrote and starred in “Forgetting Sarah
Marshall”? ‘I '
Disney, you tempt me. .
There are also rumors everywhere
that you’re remaking,’ or re-mastering

' rather, the $17-million 1986 Francis Ford

Coppola-directed 3-D Epcot attraction,
“Captain EO.”

That’s just wrong, Disney..Coppola is
dead. You can watch the piece on You-
Tube — don’t put it back in Epcot.

Oh, what’s that you say, Bob Iger, Walt
Disney Company CEO? ~

“There aren’t plans to bring back ‘Cap-
tain E0’ at this time.” ’

Wow, Disney, I’m'starting to grow very
fond of you.

i What about Disney animation? I still
haven’t forgiven you yet for 2oo0’s “The
Emperor’s New Groove.” ‘

I know, the upcoming cell-animated
“The Princess and the Frog” looks mildly
intriguing, but I still predict a critical
boat full of “meh.”

While D23 was going on in California,
though, chief creative officer and Pixar
big-man John Lasseter mentioned some
new animated films at a conference in
London: “Rapunzel” and a new Winnie
the Pooh ﬁlm for Disney animation and,
from Pixar, “Cars 2” and “The Bear and
the Bow,” which ‘stars Pixar’s ﬁrst-ever
female lead character. '

Feminists unite — Pixar is gaining
girl power.

I’mistill kind of hesitant, Disney. You
tease me with Jason Segal Muppets and
a new Pixar ﬁlm, but you’re still relying
onisequels and remakes. '

' Then again, it is the John Lasseter era
of Disney, and I do trust Lasseter. But
how can I trust you?

Three words: Guillermo Del Toro.

Del Tom, the man behind the seam-
lessly beautiful “Pan’s Labyrinth,” is lead-
ing a new Disney animation label called,
Disney Double Dare You.

According to Del Toro, Double Dare
will bring back the evil, creepy villains of
Disney’s older animated ﬁlms. The ﬁrst
ﬁlm, “Trollhunters”. is a story directly
from Del Toro himself.

I give up, Disney. You control my heart
and soul. I will do anything you ‘ask. I’ll
follow you to the grave. '

But didn’t you buy Marvel Entertain-
ment last week for $4 billion? That seems
a little ﬁshy — perhaps, dare I say “cor—
porate”?

Sure, maybe Pixar will make a real

V superhero movie now, but moves like

 x        n

 

 

that suggest to me that you’re losing your
magic.

I guess buying Marvel was a good busi-
ness decision, but something just doesn’t -
seem right. I

I’ll give you Marvel, Disney, but you’re
on thin ice.

That’s it. We’re done. At the end of the
D23 expo, Disney announced an update

rllbittrnan: Problems in secondary show up for second. co

/1..

ANIHERST, N.Y. —— In aﬂash, running
back Dion Lewis turned a close game
into a blowout during Pitt’s 54-27 vic-
tory over Buffalo on Saturday.

Leadingthe Bulls by 13 points late
in the fourth quarter, the Panthers
took over on downs after Buffalo
failed to convert on a fourth-down
touchdown pass attempt from 20
yards out.

Afalse start penalty later, the true
freshman took ahandoff from quar-
terback Bill Stull at the Panthers’ 15-
yard line. He broke through Buffalo’s
defensive line and into the secondary,
with roughly 50 yards of wide-open
space ahead of him.

“Just protect the ballwas my first
thought,” Lewis said. “We pretty
much have the game under control.
When I got to the open ﬁeld, I thought
that I could out—run them, so I just
turned on the jets.”

And turn on the jets he did ——for
all of 85 yards.

A burst of speed later and Lewis
was standing in the endzone, mark-
ing his second ‘touchdown of the
game. The Panthers held a20-point
lead with less than ﬁve minutes left
in the game. ‘ V 4

Lewis ﬁnished the day with 190
yards on 24 attempts. Itwas his sec-
ond consecutive 100-yard game.
Against_Youngstown State, Lewis
carried the ball20 timesfor 129 yards
and two touchdowns. .

For the Bulls, he was a player

_ they couldn’t contain. But for the

Panthers, he’s exactly what they

expected.

“Dion Lewis to me is not afresh-
man,” Stull said. “He came in and did
his thing in the spring, and he’s kept
getting better.”

That’s good news about the back-

.ﬁeld considering the big-time loss of

former Pitt star LeSean McCoy, who

left after his sophomore year to join ‘

the NFL.

Running wasn’t the only thing
Lewis was doingwell. He also caught
six passes for 46 yards — second
most on the team in the game.

AMHERST, N.Y.— Coming into
the season, the Pitt football team’s
defense was unquestionably the
team’s strongest asset, but the

 defense has a major weakness.

For the second straight week,
the Panther secondary had issues
not only in coverage, but with
tackling. Although Pitt beat Buf-
falo 54-27, the Bulls seamlessly
moved the ball through the air
‘all day.

“We can’t come out there and
play like that and expect to win

games,” junior safety Dom DeCic—

co said. .“We deﬁnitely need to do

some work in the secondary.”
Bulls quarterback Zach May-

' nard completed 24-of-35 pass

attempts for 400 yards and four
touchdowns. The-,_4oo yards are
a Buffalo school record since the
Bulls joined Division I in 1999.
Maynard’s two favorite targets
on Saturday were seniors Brett
Hamlinand Naaman Roosevelt,
who combined for 306 receiving
yards. Hamlin hauled in a career-
best 12 receptions for 149 yards.
Roosevelt caught six passes for
a career—high 157 yards and two
touchdowns. Roosevelt’s 26.2
yard—per-catch average was a bit

inﬂated thanks to his two touch-
down receptions, which went for

edt said. “They’re both playmak—

ers.”

It was the ﬁrst time in Buf-
falo’s Division I history that two
Bull receivers had more than 100

A yards receiving in the same game.

One reason for the big play of the
receivers was because of Pitt’s hei-
nous tackling. _

A few times a Buffalo receiver

caught a slant pass over the mid— I

defenders. Sometimes the Bull
receiver stutter-stepped to fake

The Pitt men’s soccer team dropped its second

afternoon against the LaSalle Explorers. It was

which took place at Founders Field.

In the Panthers’ other game of the invita-

The Panthers had a chance to rebound late

Sophomore midﬁelder Ryan Brode crossed

Volleyball struggles against elite co

Senior Staﬂ" Writer

Afterbeginningthe season 5-1, the

5 Pitt women’s volleyball team now
looks to snap a,ﬁve—game losing
streak with its armual Blue-Gold
Tournament at the Fitzgerald Field
House this weekend.

Pitt dropped three matches this
weekend in the Comcast Challenge,
hosted by the University of New
Mexico, and tookjust one set inthe
tournament.

The caliber of competition
had a lot to do with the Panthers’
struggles.

Out of the three teams Pitt
played — Baylor, Cal State Fuller-
ton and New Mexico - only Cal

all season priorto the tournament.
New Mexico and Baylor continue
to lead the Mountain West Con-
ference and Big 12 Conference,
respectively.

“Baylor is 11-0 right now and
the best team next to Penn State
that we played all year. They’re get-
tingvotes for the top 25,” Pitt coach-
Toby Rens said. “Unfortunately, we
never got going against them or the

other teams. It was tough against
that caliber of competition because
they don’t give you any breaks.”

The Panthers said they look for-
ward to returning to their home
arena.

“We’re deﬁnitely looking for-
ward to playing at home this week-
end,” Rens said. “Nine of our ﬁrst 11
games have been on the road, and
our record isn’twhere we want it to
be. But we’ve seen a lot of growth

V in our team.”

The Panthers will take on Val-
paraiso on Saturday at 5 pm. to
begin the tournament. Pitt follows
that with Maryland Eastern Shore
and Youngstown State to conclude
the weekend before charging into
Big East play in the following
weeks.

Before the tournament, the Pan-
thers received eight votes for the
AVCA Top 25.

The Panthers were swept in
their ﬁrst two matches in the
Comcast Challenge against Baylor
and Cal State Fullerton, but took
the second set of their ﬁnal match
against New Mexico.

JuniorAmy Town had14kills in
the match and 35 on the weekend
for the Panthers. Michelle Rossi

mpetition

led the Panthers in the match with
13 digs.

Senior Meagan Dooley paced
the Panthers with 36 kills and 15
blocks in the tournament. She was
the only Panther to be nominated
for the All- Comcast Challenge team
at the end of the tournament.

Dooley also improved to fourth

on the career all—time block assisgsg. I

during the team’s second match, a
3-0 loss to Cal State Fullerton. She
now has 308 career block assists,
is fourth on the all—time career total
blocks list (413) and is second all-
time in career solo blocks (105).

“Meagan was great. She held 5‘
high-hitting percentage throughout
the weekend at .306,” Rens said. “In
our last match, she was aforce and
almost unstoppable at times. She
played very well as a captain and
an individual on the court.” 

The Panthers maintained block
advantages in two of their three
matches, out—blocl<ing Cal State
Fullerton 8-6 and New Mexico
13-9.

Senior Melissa Stadelman
