Pitt library
system may
gain space
in Masonic
Temple

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Pitt's $8.5 million purchase of the
Masonic Temple will likely become
home to the special collections divi-
sion of the University Library System,
according to Associate Vice-
Chancellor for Facilities Management
Tom Hussey.

“The reason the administration
bought the building was the need for
library space,” Hussey said.

Hussey said the. building, which Pitt
bought on Dec. 25, 1995, measures
approximately 16(),()()() square feet.
The size of the Temple, which is
located on Fifth Avenue across from
the Cathedral of Learning, will most
likely allow the university to utilize it
in other ways.

"Of course, many other groups
have expressed an interest in space,
but the. administration is looking into
who should get it,” Hussey said.

Hussey said that the provost’s office
is in charge of planning the specific
utili7.ation of the Masonic Temple
space. Bob Pack, who is handling the
matter in the provost’s office, could
not be reached for comment.

According to Hussey, Pitt has
signed an agreement whereby it will
share the building’s expenses with
the Masons for the next two years.

“In return, the Masons will be given
first priority to use the building dur-
ing that time,” Hussey said, emphasiz-
ing that “Pitt owns the building 100
percent.”

Hussey said the Masons expect to
find a new building within the next
two years.

Violence erupted early
Saturday morning at a social
held by the Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity in the William Pitt
Union, causing the festivities to
shut down early.

According to WPU gl'21(lLl;l[C
assistant manager Robert Delie,
who was on duty at the time of
the incident, a fight started at
approximately 1:15 a.m. at the
event. Delie said the. event was
closed down about 13 minutes
later.

“Some arguing or pushing
occurred," Delie said.

“Campus police were called
in for backup, and at 1:50 [a.m.l
they decided to close it early.“

Delie said Pittsburgh city
police were also called in as an
additional security measure.

“We had over 4()() students in
here, and if fights break out
things can get out of hand.”
Delie said.

Louis Condrey, a member of
Alpha Phi Alpha, said he was
not certain how the fight
began. “We really don’t know
who started it,” Condrey said.

“All I can remember seeing
was a whole crowd of people
moving around.”

PPC stipulates against explicit art

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

Hoping to avoid tangling with
the American Civil Liberties
Union this year, the Pitt Program
Council has established a series
of requirements for eligibility in
its upcoming 1994 Student Art
Show.

Last year, Pitt student David
Brown, at that time a third—year
student, submitted a painting of a
penis tree entitled, “There's no
place like Hollidaysburg".

The PPC Art Committee, how-
ever, tried to keep the painting
from being displayed last year
because they found it to be too
offensive for the university's envi-
ronment.

Vice Chancellor of Student

Affairs William Harmon defended
the move, saying “There is no
attempt at censorship, but there is
an attempt at good taste.”

The American Civil Liberties
Union took up Brown’s issue and
eventually won, clearing the way
for the painting to be displayed.

This year, the PPC is prepared
to avoid a repeat of last year’s
controversy.

As a part of the application
process, six guidelines for eligi-
bility have been established. One
of the guidelines states that
“explicit sexual imagery will not
be accepted.”

The guidelines define “explicit
sexual imagery” as anything that
depicts exposed sexual organs
and/or sexual intercourse.

“It was recommended by the

university attorneys,” said PPC
advisor Tom Misuraca.

“Last year we had some prob-
lems with some of the submis-
sions for the show," he said.. "We
ended up running into some legal
problems and decided to come
up with specific rules to better
monitor the submissions.”

Misuraca said the decision to
include these clauses was a joint
one between PPC and Pitt attor-
neys.

Last year’s art show had no reg-
ulations behind it. This year’s is
“closer to the correct way,"
according to Misuraca.

Teri Scott, assistant to the direc-
tor of Pittsburgh’s ACLU chapter,
said the ACLU is currently look-
ing into the clause to determine

Abortion pill unsafe,
pharmacist tells 5/1

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Pharmacist Bogomir M. Kuhar warned students at last
night’s Students for Life meeting that the “abortion pill" is
not as easy or as safe as many people think.

“You’re basically giving the mother two very potent
chemicals [during this treatmentl which results in the
delivery of a dead child," said Kuhar, who is the Western
Pennsylvania Regional Coordinator of Pharmacists for
Life.

Kuhar called RU—-486 "the human pesticide." The drug,
which blocks nourishment to the fetus during early preg-
nancy, has been the subject of controversy between pro-
life and pro—choice groups since its overseas release. '

But, according to Kuhar, effects of the drug can go far
beyond aborting the child. He cited research conducted
in countries where RU-486 is legal.

Student Health develops alcohoi, erug survey

By Barbara Merrin
For The Pitt News

The Student Health Service
will be distributing question-
naires to 1,500 Pitt students
this month inquiring about
their drug and alcohol use pat-
terns.

The questionnaire is part of a
comprehensive survey intended
to assist the Student Health
Service in developing needed
health education programs and
services on campus.

According to Dr. Shirley
Haberman of the Student
Health Service, the U.S.
Department of Education has
awarded them a grant for the
purpose of expanding sub-
stance abuse programs.
The grant is funding the survey
and any programs that are
developed as a result of the sur-
vey.

Haberman said the Student
Health Service has “periodically
conducted substance abuse sur-

veys in order to identify prob-
lems among Pitt students and
therefore do a better job of
designing programs responsive
to the students’ needs.” The
“Smart Cookie” facts that occa-
sionally appear in The Pitt News
are based upon the results of
their last survey.

The questionnaire was devel-
oped by the Student Health
Service and is partly based
upon Haberman’s dissertation
for her doctorate degree.

The students selected to par-
ticipate in the survey were cho-
sen through a computer-gener-
ated random selection process.
The students will respond to the
questionnaire anonymously,
and answers will be kept confr-
dennal

The four sections of the ques-
tionnaire include questions
about the student’s background,
current attitudes and behaviors
involving drugs and alcohol,
the frequency of use of various
substances and the student’s

experiences with drinking and
drug use.

, Some of the survey questions
deal with the problems that can
result from substance abuse,
including true/false statements
such as “I have physically hurt
myself or someone else when I
was drunk or ‘high”’ and “I
have changed courses or major
to avoid failing because of too
much ‘partying.”’

The Student Health Service
currently offers several pro-
grams for students with drug
and/or alcohol use problems.
The Personal Education
Assistance and Referral is most-
ly for students who have com-
mitted drug and alcohol viola-
tions, although some students
suspected to have problems are
referred to the program by
other students.

There are also support groups
for adult children of alcoholics
and for students recovering
from substance abuse. Smoking
cessation consultations are

available.

Along with the “Smart
Cookie” campaign, the Student
Health Service sponsors many
other awareness campaigns,
with representatives speaking
with fraternities, sororities and
athletes, and attending fresh-
man studies classes.

Haberman emphasized that it
is “important for students to
complete the questionnaire in
order to obtain an accurate pro-
file of students’ drinking and
drug use patterns and subse-
quently develop effective pro-
grams.”

She also said that responding
is necessary because some stu-
dents do not believe the results
of the “Smart Cookie” survey,
thinking that most Pitt students
are drinking or using drugs, an
idea not supported by the sur-
vey results.

Haberman added that she
believes this is a common mis-
perception on campus, and that

Pharmacy academy serves as SGB of School of Pharmacy

By Tom Damico
For The Pitt News

The Academy of Students of
Pharmacy is a local division of
the American Pharmaceutical
Association and can be consid-
ered “the [Student Government
Board] of the School of
Pharmacy,” said academy presi-
dent Nikki Hudak.

Consisting of a 13-member
executive board that oversees all
activities, the ASP is a represen-
tative group exclusively for stu-
dents in the School of Phannacy.

Students are automatically
welcomed into the ASP upon
acceptance into Pitt’s School of
Pharmacy. The academy holds
monthly general meetings for all
members and anyone who may
be interested in applying to the
School of Pharmacy.

Among the services provided
to pharmacy students is the

‘ chance to help the community

through several volunteer pro-
jects, according to Hudak.

Some of the volunteer work
done last semester includes par-
ticipating in the United \X/ay’s
Day of Caring and helping to
build houses along with Habitat
for Humanity, according to acad-
emy member Jennifer Solecki.

There are a number of upcom-
ing events planned for this
semester also. Among these
events include “a booth that will
be set up for the Hand-in-Hand
Festival on March 26,” said mem-

' ber Brenda Lanzendofer.

Also, volunteers will be asked
to serve meals at the Bethlehem
Haven, a shelter for women who
have been abused or aban-
doned.

Every year in November the
ASP conducts a Patient
Counseling Competition. This
event gives pharmacy students
the chanceto show off what

said, “The top 10 winners are
awarded with a free edition of
the -United States Pbarmacopeia
Drug Information” provided by
APHA. This three-book volume
is “very useful to pharmacy stu-
dents in advising patients about
particular infomiation once they
become pharmacists,” she
added.

The winner, funded by the
School of Pharmacy, is sent to
the national competition to com-
pete against students from the
other 74 pharmacy schools in
the country. This national com-

they have learned.

According to Hudak, the stu-
dents are given information on a
particular drug to review for a
few minutes. Then, the students
are asked to complete an indi-
vidual advising session with a
mock patient. The students must
successfully advise the “patient”
about the drug, including the
effects and other issues concern-
ing it. These advising sessions
are taped and judged by a panel
that decides which student wins
the competition.

national meeting will be held in
Seattle, Wash. during the week
of March 18-22.

The ASP also publishes a
newspaper exclusively for the
School of Pharmacy entitled The
Pitt Capsule. According to co-
Editor Elizabeth Oh, the newspa-
per is usually published two
times a semester.

Included in each publication
are storieslabout the current
activities of the different organi-

zations within the School of
Phamiacy, and articles highlight-
ing specific faculty members or
classes. This year there has only
been one issue, and in the coin-
ing months there will be a sup-
plement printed to go along with
the first issue, Oh said.

“The reason for the lack of
publications this year is due to a
shortage of funds,” Oh said.
These lost funds are currently
being used to increase the
paper’s coverage and the num-
ber of publications in the years
to come.

Not many students at Pitt
would use their own time and
money to reach other students
about starting a club or adver—
tising a debate.

“I’m pretty dedicated,” said
Chris Hanson, who is attempt-
ing to establish a Pitt Atheists
and Unbelievers club. “There
was really no other way to get
this group started.”

Most recently, Hanson was
involved with the organization
of the “Existence of God”
debate two weeks ago.

“I invited the atheist speaker,
Dr. Gordon Stein,” Hanson said.
“The debate was also spon-
sored by the Campus Crusade
for Christ, but I was afraid that,
from lCCCl ads, skeptics may
not realize that Stein was an
atheist. So I designed my own
flyers to hang around campus
which mentioned that the

Dedicated Atheist works to form group

debate was also [partially] spon-
sored by the Pittsburgh Secular
Humanists.”

Hanson said he was surprised
by the turnout of nearly 200
people for debate, which he fig-
ured would draw about 50. He
said he was pleased with the
setup of the debate and the
choice of a fair moderator.

“I thought Stein won,”
Hanson said. He also said he is
encouraged by the interest he's
heard for his prospective club.

“Other religious groups are
funded by the student activities
fee on campus, and students of
every religion must pay the
fee,” Pitt student Scott Quay
said. Quay said he is looking
forward to the formation of an

atheist group.

Hanson, a sophomore major-
ing in philosophy who trans-
ferred to Pitt, is no stranger to
atheist groups. During the year
he spent at the University of

U.M. Atheists and Unbelievers.
According to Hanson, the group
now has more than 200 people
on its mailing list.

\X/hen he came to Pitt, he said
he wanted to find others who
shared similar beliefs.

“I put an ad in The Pitt News
and posted tlyers around cam-
pus,” Hanson, a member of the

Pittsburgh Secular Humanists,“

said. He said the response on
campus has been more than
enough for the 10—person 1nini—
mum to apply for an official stu-
dent group certification.

“The constitution for the
group has been written,” said
Hanson. “There is no reason

why we won’t be a student“

group.”

“We can use the funds to get
get speakers and have club
activities ourselves,” Quay said.
He said he hoped to see the
club sponsor a debate on evolu-
tion vs. creation, possibly

involving professors from Pitt’s 

biology and history and philos-
ophy of science departments.

Hanson said once the group
is certified, he hopes to meet
approximately every three
weeks.

In addition, Hanson said he’d.-

like to sponsor special events

such as a free showing of the-

original “Inherit the Wind".
Hanson said there is also inter-
est to form a critical bible study
group. He said the group

would be open to debate, but I‘

focus on critiquing the Bible.

“I’m sure we’re going to

“We may not pursue it,

__~chair Anne Weiss said the

Haberman said that she is

,__:p“_r_edicting that, similar to

national trends, we will see an
increase in usage patterns with
some drugs.”

She stated that recent nation-
al surveys indicate that declines
in substance abuse are now
reversing and that drug use is
on the rise, with alcohol use
remaining consistent, and that
Pitt will probably reflect this
trend.

However, junior Paula
Hoffman said she thinks just
the opposite. “There is proba-
bly a bigger problem here with
alcohol than with drugs,” she
said.

Any programs that will be
developed as a result of the sur-
vey will be instituted as soon as
possible, according to
Haberman. Current substance
abuse programs will be contin-
ued, and the Student Health
Service will most likely revise
their programs over the sum-
mer in order to be enacted by
this fall.

“In some cases, the mothers
have suffered severe side effects
which include death,” Kuhar
said. He explained that 60-80
percent of the time, when used
alone, RU-486 is not successful
in aborting the child. According
to Kuhar, the pill can result in a
child with birth defects or the
mother could suffer blee_ding
from the time-consuming treat-
ment.

“This is not a one pill, one-
time event,” Kuhar said. “Taking
RU—486 usually involves at least
four visits to a physician and
very complex treatments.”

The drug has been tested and
legalized in such countries as
Great Britain, France and
Sweden.

According to Kuhar, the rea-
son for RU-486's possible legal-
ization in the U is not for its
health benefits, but for pharma-
ceutical companies’ profit.

Jeff Paladina, president of

   

Students for Life, said pro-life
forces should be aware of what
the drug companies are trying
to do.

“To protest RU-486, we need
to educate about its dangers,”
Paladina said. “In addition, we
should refuse to buy from com-
panies who are currently
involved with it in other coun-
tries.”

Many of the Pitt students who
packed Room 527 of the
William Pitt Union said they did
not realize all of the drug’s neg-
ative effects.

Creativity not censorship

Individual creativity seems to be the last thing on
the Pitt Program Council Art Committee’s mind for
this year’s art show. Instead, they are focusing on
how to enforce their notion of good taste while
attempting to avoid legal entanglements.

This all began last year when David Brown, a
junior at Pitt,‘ submitted a painting of a penis tree
entitled “There’s no place like Hollidaysburg.” The
Art Committee attempted to exclude the painting
from the show. i

The American Civil Liberties Union heard about the
prohibition and sued for Brown. They won, and the
painting had to be displayed.

This year, the Art Council has established six guide-
lines which works must meet in order to be eligible.
The specific clause which would have excluded
Brown’s painting, had it been in place, reads:
“Explicit sexual imagery will not be accepted.
Explicit sexual imagery is defined as works depicting
exposed sexual organs and/ or sexual intercourse.”

This ﬂies in the face of centuries of artistic tradi-
tions. Some of the greatest paintings in history are of
nudes. Furthermore, eroticism has always played a
large role in art. _ I

A work such as Michelangelo’s “David” would have
been excluded from the show under these guide-
lines, as would the original form of the Sistine
Chapel. _.

Yet, students s.tudy these works in art courses here
at Pitt. Are we  .e:sting_,_;..,t;hat   not t_ry;,;to

follow in the traditl
These guidelines se_ _   ,_
any art they want,  th; 1‘
the kind of art deemed acceptable.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs William Harmon
explained that last year when he tried to ban
Brown’s painting. “There is no attempt at censorship,
but there is an attempt at good taste,” he said. One
person arbitrarily picking what is “good taste” is cen-
sorship.

Once anyone begins to regulate art, there is no art.
Why should the Pitt Program Council even bother to
hold an art show if they are not going to permit all
art to be submitted?

Why should students bother to attend the show if
all they are going to see is someone’s watered down
exhibit of good taste?

There is little point to the entire effort if nothing
will come of it except someone’s subjective notions
of what is right and proper. I

Art should be the expression of individual creativi-
ty, not an expression of the creativity of university
policies. I

Don't teach children "groupism"

One hundred years from now
when historians do research on
the United States in the 1990s,
it will be impossible for them
to overlook this decade’s latest
buzzword —— multiculturalism.
What is not known is how they
will judge the effects of our
current movement on the shap-
ing of American society as the
United States is poised to enter
the twenty-first century.

It has to be left to the histori-
ans to judge both its positive
and negative benefits, but it
would behoove this nation to
take a look at what multicultur-
alism really means and how it
is portrayed and bastardized in
the United States today.

Like so many things in
America’s present day pop-cul-

ture society, multiculturalism is

a positive goal that has been
turned upside-down and
skewed by the present tide of
ultra—liberal “political correct-
ness.” It preaches tolerance but,
in reality, creates the exact
opposite — intolerance of all
who don’t go along with the
premise that minorities and
women have it tougher in
America than we white males.

As somebody who has a B.A.
in International Studies and is
currently majoring in EastAsia,
I am certainly in favor of our
schools teaching children about
other races, religions and cus-
toms. In our global society of
today’s world, it is absolutely
imperative that the citizens of
the United States gain a knowl-
edge of geography, foreign lan-
guages and cultures of other
nations.

A major reason why the
United States. has not had a
huge amount of success in the
Japanese markets is our igno-
rance of and arrogance toward
the Japanese people and cul-
ture.

Multiculturalism, from my
point of view, should teach
people to focus on a person’s
character, not race or gender. It
seems _to me that the liberals
are doing the opposite. First
and foremost, we are ALL
Americans and whether certain
groups like it or not, America
does have a distinct culture.
Children (and adults for that
matter) must be taught to be
Americans first and African,
Chinese, European, etc. sec-
ond.

By all means children should
keep their ethnic heritages, but
it should not be done by teach-
ing them “groupism.”
Universities teaching Women’s

  

Tony

Dickensheets  

Studies and Black Studies,
where women and black stu-
dents are the majority of those
enrolled, does not teach those
students about multiculturalism.
It teaches them about their
own little groups.

Clearly this is not good for
those groups or for America.
America IS an integrated soci-
ety, and to tell ﬁfth—grade girls
that they have to be taught in
all-female classes so that the
boy students won’t intimidate
them is just plain ludicrous and

Z sexist. ‘Wliat kind of confidence

will those girls have when they
grow up and must deal with
men on the job and in their

personal lives? _ _

Many liberals and feminists
seemed determined to continue
to teach women and minorities
that they can’t succeed in main-
stream America because of
white male “oppression.” This
nonsense is taught despite the

 

overwhelming evidence to the
contrary. ‘

They are teaching victim-
hood, not multiculturalism.
Schools in the United States
should teach students the truth
about history; not rewrite it
because it is “politically correct”
to do so. There is no doubt that
history classes should include
the study of the civilizations
which existed in the New
World before the arrival of the
European explorers, but it is
simply wrong to judge
Columbus and the other
explorers of the fifteenth centu-
ry by today’s standards and val-
ues.

There are not many people
who would argue with the fact
that slavery was a terrible peri-
od in this nation’s history, but
the WHOLE story of the slave
trade should be taught to our
children. The slave-trading tri-
angle involved merchants and
traders in Europe, the United
States and Africa.

The Europeans did not
invade Africa, they went there
to trade and bought slaves from
Africans in return for goods.
How the Europeans treated the
slaves on the boats and in
America on the plantations was
reprehensible, but let’s tell our
children the entire story. Don’t
distort the facts by rewriting
history through Orwellian
methods.

Contrary to what the majority
of liberals believe, most issues
in this country do not involve
gender or racial bias. We
would do well to improve our
education system so that our
children will be qualified for
the jobs of the next century
and leave the nonsense of
“political correctness” to the
goons who invented it.

Market

for jobs

changes

often

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

After spending thousands of
dollars on tuition and countless
hours studying, graduation for
thousands of Pitt students is
rapidly approaching. The diffi-
cult task before them is to find a
job.

Brad Gammons, a senior
majoring in Interdisciplinary
Studies, is one of many who
saidhe is discouraged about the
opportunities that lie after grad-
uation.

“The economy has changed
in such a way that we don’t
share the privileges our parents
had of graduating from college
in four years, finding a job and
buying a house,” Gammons
said.

Lou Stone, a senior behavioral
neuroscience major, agreed. “I
have to go to graduate school
because there are no jobs in my
major," he said.

Stone, who intends to be a
research doctor, said he would
have been better off going to a
trade school to find a job.

But the market isn’t complete-
ly dry. Bonnie Yellin, a place-
ment counselor with the place-
ment service at Pitt, said she
understands the concerns of
students who are not in a tech-
nical major, but she stresses that
there are still opportunities for
these students.

“It’s more of a profile than a
degree,” Yellin said. “One of the
strongest students [for prospec-
tive employment] to come out
of Pitt last year was a liberal arts
student who majored in English
writing and communications.
She had two internships, was
president of her sorority and
had excellent public-speaking
skills,” all of which are very
beneficial to job hunting,
according to Yellin.

Another key to landing a suc-
cessful job, according to place-
ment counselor Kevin Collins, is
starting the search early.

“Don’t wait until your senior
year to get started,” Collins said.
“There are a lot of different
ways [the placement center] can
help you [when] presenting
yourself to employers,” added
Collins.

Some students, despite the
help offered by Pitt’s placement
service, are still discouraged
about the job outlook.

Gammons said, “The [currentl
job market is ﬂooded because
we are at the tail end of the
baby boom. We need to get
more education,” which is why
so many students are choosing
to go to graduate school.

There are also many students
who choose to continue their
education because it is required
for their job, such as going to
medical or law school.

yourself
with the
first letter
you send

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

You have searched for
the perfect job. Your
resume, after weeks of
working on it, is perfect.
You are ready to step out
of Pitt and into the real
world. The only thing
you are missing is a great
cover letter.

Cover letters are those
formal letters that are sent
to all your prospective
places of employment.
Cover letters represent an
important part of the job-
seeking process because
they can be the first
impression you make on
an employer.

Kevin Collins, a place-
ment counselor at the
placement service at Pitt,
outlined the important
parts of a cover letter.

Writing to a specific
person instead of a gen-
eral name helps to set a
friendly atmosphere.

“The key to any good
cover letter,” according to
Collins, “is in the first
paragraph you should
indicate why you are
writing.”

The first paragraph
should identify the job or
area of the company you
are interested in.

The next two or three
paragraphs should be a
“summary of your selling
points [followed] by para-
graphs that go into more
details,” Collins said.

For example, the sec-
ond paragraph should list
a specific qualification
and supporting state-
ments to show evidence
of the skills acquired.

The final paragraph
should be used as a fol-
low—up.

List a telephone num-
ber where you can be
reached if the employer
would like to set up an
interview, according to
Collins.

Although students will
be applying for many
jobs, the placement cen-
ter counselors said it is
not necessary to make
completely different let-
ters for each application.
Students should develop
a few basic cover letters
—- for example, one for
management, and one for
public relations if those
are the two areas you
are seeking employment
in.

With minor changes.
the letters can be adapted
for different companies.

In today’s competitive job
market, its essential to give
yourself every advantage, and
contrary to what many students
think, you don’t have to wait
until your senior year to start
preparing yourself for a career.

Whatever your major, there
are three main areas that
employers will look at when
evaluating you as a candidate
— education, experience and
extracurricular activities. You
can work on all of these areas
throughout your years at Pitt,
starting from day one.

When recruiters look at your
educational background, they
often focus on your grade point
average. While there has been
much debate over a possible
correlation between high
grades and excellent job perfor-
mance, the fact remains that
maintaining a good GPA cer-
tainly won’t hurt your chances

for employment.

or industry that you’ve targeted
for your professional career.

Impress prospective employers when
you walk in the door, dress for success

By Christine Hanna
Managing Editor

First impressions could be one of
the keys to getting that job you want
right out of college.

“First impressions are critical, so
you want to present a polished and
professional appearance,” said Jane
Denovcheck, associate director of
the Placement Service.

“You don’t want to wear anything
that would distract the employer
from you as a candidate,”
Denovcheck said.

According to Denovcheck, an
applicant’s appearance might not be
the key to securing a job offer, but it
can help make a difference.

“The bottom line in a competitive
job market is that you want to have
as much competitive edge as you
can, and looking sharp is part of
that,” Denovcheck said.

Looking sharp for interviews
means dressing conservatively and
tailored, she said.

Men should wear “dark, conserva-
tive suits.” Denovcheck said to go
with blacks, dark blues and browns.

For women, once again she said
the conservative dark-colored suit is
the best way to go.

Skirts should not be too short
either,she said.

“There are wonderful pant suits
out there, but most employers won’t
respond as positive to that,”

Denovcheck said.

According to Denovcheck, men
and women need to look into the
industry which they are applying to
see if they should add a touch of cre-
ativity to their appearance.

What is appropriate for a bank
might be different from what is
appropriate for an advertising firm or
an engineering consulting firm, she
said.

Ties are a prime example of where
you can be a little more creative.
Usually, “conservative is the thread”
for ties, she said, but sometimes “a
tie would ﬂy better in more creative
careers.”

However, there are strategies
that you can use to help make
your interviews both less stress-
ful and more effective.

Remember that interviewing
is a two-way street. You need to
take a pro-active role in the
whole process. This means that
you should go into interviews
with your own agenda, i.e.
those things about your back-
ground that you most want the
recruiter to know about.

To create your agenda, sit
down with a copy of your
resume and some note paper.
What items on your resume do
you feel are the most important
to discuss in your upcoming
interview?

To put it another way, if you
had only three minutes to inter-
view instead of 30, what ele-
ments of your background
would you choose to highlight?
Remember that any interview is
never quite long enough to
cover everything. '

You need to prioritize your

Also,
you could provide some exam-
ples of successful leadership or
project management in
extracurricular activities you
have participated in.

You also need to ask ques-
tions in the interview about the
job, so you’ll want to do a little
research on the organization.
Essentially, you should know
three key facts —— what the
organization does, how large it
is in relation to other organiza-
tions in their field or industry,
and what its current overall
strategy or organizational mis-
sion is.

Other bits of information may
come in handy, but just know-
ing the basics can get you
through most interviews.

During the interview, use the
recruiter’s questions to talk
about the strengths that you had
earlier identified as most impor-
tant.

For example, if you’re asked
“Tell me about yourself.” use

A diploma from the
University of Pittsburgh is no
guarantee for a good job. In
fact it’s no guarantee for any
job. If this thought keeps you
awake at night, there is some-
thing you can do to tip the
odds in your favor — an
internship.

“For top-notch students,
internships serve as a setting
to get two feet in the door,
and for the average student
they provide good experi-
ence,” said Daniel Doud,
director of the internship pro-
gram for the computer sci-
ence department.

Many students agree that
their internships have been
beneficial.‘

Joanne Fiamma described
the internships she has done

Aggressive behavior essential in
cinching beneﬁcial internship

Pitt student Karen Krasuse

as “absolutely valuable.”
Fiamma, a senior in the
School of Pharmacy, said, “the was also pleased with her
experience of an internship internship at Merril Lynch, “I

ship in any field.”

John Jacob, a graduate stu-
dent from Duquesne and an
intern for KDKA television
station, pointed out that busi-
nesses want to see that
prospective employees have
had hands—on experience.

“One of the big things  in
this industry is practical expe-
rience.” He also explained
that many KDKA employees
were once interns. “From talk-
ing to people, [I’ve found that]

internships the students do
often help them start their
careers.“Often the point behind
this program is to lead to a job,”
she said.

Although students have found
internships to be very valuable,
Doud also mentioned that they
are meant for students, and
businesses often misuse intern-
ships.“The term internship is
widely abused- In some cases
they are used just to recruit peo-
ple not as a [learning experi-
encel,” he said.

Not only is there a variety of
internships available, but there
is also a variety of ways to get
an internship. Students can
approach businesses on their
own, but many departments at
the University of Pittsburgh
have programs to facilitate a
student’s search for an intern-
ship.

The Institute of Politics helps
place students in internships
which involve working with
elected officials on the local,
state and federal level. Students
from any major are eligible, but
they must take a seminar to
become an intern. Selection for
the internship is very Competi-

tive, and 10-15 students are
chosen each semester.

“We didn’t start this program
as a pre-career program. It’s a
learning experience so that stu-
dents are able to get the most
out of our class,” said Robin
Jones, co—director of the
Institute of Politics internship
program.

She did add that although the
program is not responsible or
intended for the acquisition of a
job, the internships often lead to
the start of a career.

The co-op program helps
chemistry and engineering stu-
dents get internships where
they can “gain a tremendous
amount of experience that com-
plements their undergraduate
degree,” said Natili.

But they also have a special
feature not often found in an
internship. “They do get paid,”
she said.

To receive these internships,
students must be in good stand-
ing at Pitt, and they must also
go through an interview.Doud
said that the computer science
department has helped place
students in internships at large
corporations as well as newly
established small businesses

and everywhere in between.

Student interns pointed out
that variety was an important
part of a good internship. Jones
also said that interns should be
able to do a lot of things so that
they can learn what they want
to do and what they don’t want
to do. Whether you go to a
business directly or get assis-
tance from an internship pro-
gram, students agree that you
must, above all, be aggressive.

Jacob first went through an
intern service at Duquesne
University where he was given
the name of someone he could
Contact at KDKA. He went to
the station and expressed inter-
est in an internship, which he
received.“You have to be
aggressive. You can’t sit back
and wait for someone to do it
for you,” he said.

Because of Pennsylvania state
requirements, Fiamma is
required to serve as an intern

for 1,500 hours to acquire her ‘

pharmacy license. Two of the
three internships she has done,
she found on her own.

“You have to be as aggressive
as you can. If they turn you
down one summer, go back and
try again the next summer,” she

said.

Krasuse also gave advice on
choosing the right internship.

“Check out all the different
places, and ﬁnd a place where
they are offering experience
where you’re actually learning
something, not just running
around making photocopies.
Find a good one; it’s great for
your resume,” she said.

The University of Pittsburgh
has an internship office which
has indexed many internship
opportunities. To receive credit
for an internship, students must
have already earned 55 credits
and have maintained a 2.0 QPA.
Student must also have com-
pleted two courses in the area
they wish to intern in.

They can have six internship
credits per term and can apply
12 credits toward graduation.

Students must also find a fac-
ulty sponsor, who designs the
course work for the internship,
which will determine the
amount of credits that will be
earned.

Students can receive help
putting together a resume,
which is often needed for an
internship, through Pitt’s

“We’ve seen a lot of changes
in the job market, and it is
showing some signs of
improvement,” Collins said.

Yellin, who considers
Western Pennsylvania to be a
“conservative hiring” area, said
there are jobs for students upon
graduation, especially for those
willing to relocate.

“Candidates who can demon-
strate that they can achieve
results, have a pro-active
approach and are ﬂexible about
geographic relocation are in the
best position,” Yellin said.

Collins added, “Students must

know their strengths” and use
them fully in finding a job.

“There are a\l‘ot of different
ways that we can help here,”
Collins said. “Seniors graduating
in April or August should come
down here as soon as possible.”

for the more conservative
careers, she said.

Attention to detail is
critical to first impres-
sions.

Men should polish
shoes and have a neat,
well-groomed haircut.
Women should make
sure there are no runners
in their stockings, no
scuffs on the heels of
their shoes and no chips
in their nail polish.

Also, in sloppy weath-
er, she recommended
wearing different shoes to
the interview and then
changing once there.

Not being polished and
attentive to grooming
details could show that
this lack of attentiveness
could apply elsewhere,
Denovcheck said.

Conservative is also the
case for jewelry.

Many accessories could
distract the employer, she
said. Men should “dump
the earring” for the inter-
view, and women should
be careful not to overdo
it.

Smallish earrings, a
necklace and a pin may
accentuate the appear-
ance, but forget the wrist
full of bangle brace
lets and the hand full of
rings.

Womenls hair should
be worn back off of the
face. “Big hair is out,” she
said.

Makeup should have a
professional polish to it
since “this is not a date,”
Denovcheck said.

“Ultimately, you want
to be remembered for
dynamics of personality
and qualifications and not
just what you wore,” she
said.

It is important to know
the audience and not
come out looking devoid
of a personality.

“I’d encourage people
to practice wearing inter-
view attire,” she said.

Sometimes men and
women who usually
dress casually may feel
uncomfortable in ties,
stockings and heels.

If you don’t feel com-
fortable in what you are
wearing, then you could
feel self-conscience and
not be as positive as you
should be in your inter-
view that could get you
the job you want, she
said.

Also, practicing ensures
that you have cut all of
the tags off of the cloth-
mg.

According to
Denovcheck, people
have been known to
walk into an interview
with the tags still
attached.

Mm... .-

Interview

Continued from page 5
that question to describe one
or more of your strengths.
(“I’ll be graduating this term
with a degree in communica-
tions. I also had the opportu-
nity to work as an intern at a
newspaper last summer, and
have also been active with the
Pitt Program Council. I’d like
to utilize the skills that I’ve
developed over the past cou-
ple of years in your organiza-
tion.”)

You’ll also need to back up
your strengths with examples.
(remember the list that you
compiled earlier?) Reinforce
your points by weaving in
one— or two-minute stories.

For example, in an inter-
view you might say, “I have
strong organizational skills.
Let me give you an example.
After I was put in charge of
charity fundraising for my fra-
ternity, I developed a list of
businesses that would be like-

ly contributors, through
researching past patterns of
giving. 1 then put together a
group of fraternity brothers
who were each assigned a
small group of businesses
from my list, and my group
members visited every busi-
ness personally. This resulted
in a 25 percent increase in
total cash raised, as compared
to the previous year.”

Always have questions pre-
pared to ask the recruiter.
“What’s a typical day like on
this job?” is usually a good
question to ask. You might
also want to ask about oppor-
tunities for promotion
(“Where have previous
incumbents in this job gone in
your organization?”), and
about the next step in the hir-
ing process. (“When should I
expect to hear from you
regarding a possible second
interview?”)

It’s important to end your

interview strongly — your
wrap—up can make or break
your chances for further con-
sideration.

One of the best things that
you can do at the “close” is to
express a strong interest in the
job to the recruiter as some-
times the only real difference
between candidates is their
level of enthusiasm and inter-
est in the position. And
always send the recruiter a
professional thank-you note a
couple of days after the inter-
view.

If you need more inforrna—
tion about interviewing, stop
by the Placement Service in
Room 224 of the William Pitt
Union, or call 648-7150.

The Student Employment

opportunities for undergrads
throughout the year, including
career-related positions. Also
check with the Internship Office
at 140 Thackeray Hall and with
your academic major depart-
ment regarding internships or
co-op programs.

Finally, don’t neglect the
potential value of participation
in extracurricular activities.
Obviously, a leadership posi-
tion such as president or rush
chair is highly marketable, but
other activities within campus
organizations are also impor-
tant. Perhaps you were part of a
team that tackled a major pro-
ject for the organization, or you
acted as the liaison between

Always look for opportunities

It’ll pay off for you more than

Two losses i ii
five days span
damage team ’s
once-bright
post-season
possibilities
By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Just two short weeks ago, the
Pitt Hockey Club looked like a
nearly invincible force.

Their high—powe1'ed offense
was unstoppable, and‘ their suf-
focating defense was impene-
trable.

After a dominating 6-2 victory
over their old nemesis,
Duquesne, preceded by a 7-2
thumping of WPCHA power-
house Penn State—West, the
Panthers were truckin’ along on
championship road. '

They just didn’t see the oil
slick up ahead.

In a span of five days, the
Panthers’ promising future has
suddenly turned to startling
uncertainty after an embarrass-
ing 15-7 loss to Duquesne on
Wednesday and a costly 8-5 loss
to WPCHA—leader West Virginia
on Sunday.

: Now, after having a postsea-
son invitation practically mailed
to them two weeks ago, the loss
to WVU leaves the Panthers
searching for a ray of hope that
will lead them to a playoff

ditionally low win total of 17.

Unfortunately, Pitt doesn’t
have those big wins to put on
their resume when the NCAA
Selection Committee gives out
the bids this year.

Pitt needs at least 18 victories,
which means they have to win
their last five games and do
some damage in the Big East

Women's gym improves, but loses to E. Michigan again

By Neal Riley
Staff Writer

Last Friday, the Pitt women’s
gymnastics team competed
against Eastern Michigan
and lost but achieved its
highest team score of the sea-
son.

Two days later, the Lady
Panthers travelled to Eastern
Michigan University to compete
against the same team
and lost again, but beat their
previous top team score for the
season.

Brenda Stevens was named
ECAC Gymnast of the
Week. Stevens accomplished
two career high scores back—to—

back.

She also tied for second place
on the uneven parallel bars and
the floor exercise, and placed

third on balance beam during
Friday’s meet.

Head coach Debbie Yohman
said she was pleased with

Stevens’ solid meet perfor- _

mance.

Yohman also said she was
pleased with how the team held
up for the back-to-back meets.
With a larger lineup, Eastern
Michigan did not have to use
the same people for every
event. I

The Lady1Panthers, who have
a smaller lineup, did use the
same people.

“It’s an indication of our con-
ditioning,” Yohman said. “We
didn’t fall apart the second day.”

Not falling apart for Pitt meant
raising their team score from
180.5 points to 182.525 points.
This performance came after a
day of rest on Saturday and a

cramped van ride to Eastern
Michigan.

“When you make improve-
ments like that from one day to
another with no practice in
between, that’s pleasing to see,”
Yohman said.

Yohman said that the team
was showing some fatigue at

the end of the meet which '

affected them in the final event,
the floor exercise.

Assistant coach Ben Rovee
said the floor exercise mat
(where the gymnasts perform
dance and tumbling techniques)
at Eastern Michigan was also a
little harder than Pitt was used
IO.

The Pitt floor score was

45.875, 23 bit lower than the 46.6

that the team scored on Friday’s

meet.
Stevens

(9.3), Bethany

Toellner (9.375), Robyn Senior
(9.25), Michelle Cole (8.95) and
Lori Buck (9.0) were on the
floor for Pitt.

In the other three events, the
vault, uneven parallel bars and
balance beam, Pitt improved.

Vaulting for Pitt were
Christine Battista (9.0), Buck
(8.95), Cole (9.075), Toellner
(9.2), Senior (9.375) and Stevens
(9.225). .

Performing on the uneven
parallel bars were Meg
Johns (9.0), Stevens (9.3),Buck
(9.225), Cole (9.025), Senior
(8.95) and Toellner (7.9).

Missing her routine on Friday,
Johns got another chance on
Sunday.

Yohman said that Johns’
Sunday bar routine was per-
formed sensationally.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, February 15, 1994

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

During the summer of 1990, Wes
Alexander, presently a junior hurdler for
Pitt, was sitting on top of the world.

But little did he know he would soon
start tumbling down.

He had just completed his junior sea-
son of high school track in which he fin-
ished second in intermediate hurdles at
the Virginia Track and Field State
Championships, thus ranking him as one
of the top ten scholastic 3OO—1neter hur-
dlers in the nation according to USA
Today.

For the next eight months, the only
thing on this 6-foot-1-inch kid’s mind
was to capture the state crown in the 300
hurdles.

“Basically my major goal throughout
my whole life, especially my senior year
[of high school], was based around win-
ning the state championship,” Alexander
recalled.

“It was something he wanted to do,”
Denise Alexander, Wes’ mother, said.
“He always spent time by himself always
concentrating on it.”

During that season, Alexander terror-
ized his competition as the No. 1—ranked
hurdler in the state.

Then on a sunny day, the moment
Alexander had been waiting for had
finally come —— in front of one of the
largest crowds ever assembled to watch
a high school state track and field cham-
pionship. '

As the gun sounded in the 300 hurdles,
the Green Run senior took off like a bat
out of hell. He had a 25-meter lead on
the rest of the field, with only 100 meters
to go.

That’s when the tragedy occurred. As
Alexander leaped the next hurdle, he fell
to the ground, breaking his arm and thus
shattering the life—long dream of being a
state champion.

“After I fell on the track, I sat there and
cried in front of all those people,”
Alexander recalls.

“Then for a month after that, I didn't
really eat a lot. I was basically a bad per-
son to people trying to be nice to me. I
really didn’t want to do anything but sit
in my room and watch TV as well as

ask myself ‘How could this happen to 

me?”

Maybe this was a blessing in disguise
because it forced Alexander, a student
who had always excelled in academics,
to think of life after track.

“After I came out of being depressed, it
made me realize that there is more to life
than track,” Alexander said.

“Going through high school, I never
thought that I would go through life not
running. But after I fell, I really had
that thought. And I realized if I’m not
going to run I better get my other stuff
together. Maybe by falling was good for
me.”

His grade point average went from a
3.4 in high school to a 3.7 in college,
while majoringsin communications with
the desire to go to law school.

Even though running isn’t the most
important thing in his life anymore, he
never stopped excelling on the track.

This year, Alexander returns as Pitt’s
most experienced hurdler. Last year at
the Big East Indoor Track and Field
Championship, he captured third place
in the 55 meter hurdlers (with a time of
7.70 seconds), as well as a third—place

Tournament, to get invited.
Possibly, they could win four
out of five, but they would have
to beat No. 6 UConn on the
road.

Of course, Pitt could win the
Big East Tournament and get an

- automatic bid.

The Panthers options are lim-
ited to perfection, or they are
bound for the National
Invitation Tournament, which is
the minor league of tourna-
ments.

Nevertheless, the February
slump is on all the players’
minds.

“It’s like the end of the year,”
center Eric Mobley said of Pitt’s
recent problems. “I think a lot
of the guys are starting to think
‘Oh no, we’re going through the
same thing as last year,’ but we
can pull it out this next game
against G’Town.”

“Basically, what’s happening
is we’re going down just like
last year,” Jerry McCullough
added. “Regardless of what peo-
ple say, we got that February
slump on our minds.”

Keep in mind, this is the same
team that basketball analysts
across the country wrote off —

saying that Pitt would finish ,

eighth or ninth in the Big East.

After the team’s great start,
however, they turned a lot of
people’s heads. Naturally, when
a team has some success, there
are many people who go along
for the ride (ie. the Chicago
Bulls and Dallas Cowboys).

With Pitt starting to plummet
as of late, where are those peo-
ple now? T hey’re probably sit-
ting in their rooms watching
reruns of “Roseanne” or re—read-
ing their textbooks when Pitt is
playing.

high—stick. Without Rizzo’s
speed on the front line, Pitt had
to work its way out of a hole for
the remainder of the game.

The Panthers did, however,
kill the seven-minute WVU
power play that ensued, and
went to work on a steady uphill
climb.

With 4:26 left in the first peri-
od, and the Mountaineers short-
handed after being called for
having too many men on the
ice, the Panthers finally struck
back.

Captain Vic Disanti grabbed a
pass from defenseman Darren
Stock, weaved through a horde
of WVU defenders and snapped
a wrist shot past Mountaineer
goalie Leon Young to tie the
score at one.

Then, with just 52 seconds left
in the period, Disanti scored his
second power play goal of the
game when a slapshot by

defenseman Scott Giordano-

bounced off Young and
right to Disanti, who flipped
the puck over the fallen goal-
tender to give Pitt its first lead at
2-1.

At the start of the second peri-
od, however, the speed advan-
tage of the Mountaineers quick-
ly showed itself.

After a Panthers miscue near
their own blue line started a
two-on—one break for
the Mountaineers, WVU
center Paul Pipke grabbed

the puck and darted down the
right wing, looked off the
defenseman and scored on a
wrister to Bratkovich’s glove-
hand side, tying the score at
ITWO.

The Panther power play unit
gave them the lead once again
less than three minutes later,
when left winger Tony T rovato
grabbed the puck from behind
the WVU net, put it in front
and scored in the same
motion to make the score 3-2,
Pitt.

The Mountaineer power play
got into the action again with
2:51 remaining in the period,
when Pipke tied the score with
a low wrist shot from the left
wing circle, making the score 5-
3.

It was at this point that the
Panther defense went straight to
the locker room and forgot to
play the last two minutes of the
penod.

With 1:56 left in the second,
Pitt turned the puck over near
their own blue line with all five
men in the offensive zone, giv-
ing the Mountaineers a two—on-
none bearing down on
Bratkovich. WVU left winger
Tim Johnson banged in the pass
from center Brian Chickey to
give WVU a 4-3 lead —— a
lead they would never relin-
quish.

With 1:12 left, a replay of the
two—on-none just 24 seconds
earlier gave WVU another goal

in the final minutes of the
period, increasing their lead to
5-3.

Stock brought the Panthers
back to within one with a
breakaway goal in the final

--

minute of the period, but by this -

time, it was clear who the
aggressor was. West Virginia
showed it in the game’s final
frame.

The entire third period looked
like one long WVU power play,
as Pitt’s nonexistent backcheck—
ing allowed the Mountaineers to
practically set up camp in the
offensive zone.

They peppered Bratkovich
with 25 shots in the final period,
compared to Pitt’s seven on
Young.

Predictably, each of WVU’s
three third-period goals came at
the end of long, continuous
spurts in the Panther zone.

The 8-5 final score cast a dark
shadow on a genuinely fine
performance in net by hard—luck
netminder Bratkovich, who
stopped 40 shots.

With the loss, the Panthers
dropped to 3-4, fifth place in the
\Y/PCHA.

They do, however, have
at least a game in hand on each
of the top four teams in the
league. All this does is give
the Panthers a target to shoot
for in order to make the play-
offs.

Hitting the target is an alto-
gether different matter.

Duncan--

Continued from page 9

If anything, Pitt has over-
achieved.

All the naysayers said that Pitt
had two players, McCullough
and Mobley, surrounded by a
bunch of role players. The fact
of the matter is, the Panthers
have several good players with
a deep bench that some of the
great Panther teams didn’t have.

Indeed, Pitt fans are an
endangered species nowadays.

Where are all those people
who jocked the 1987-88 Panther
squad with Charles Smith,
Jerome Lane and Jason
Matthews? Did Vanderbilt’s
Barry Goheen really break your
hearts that much when he hit
that last—second shot to deny
Pitt the Final Four?

I guess so.
