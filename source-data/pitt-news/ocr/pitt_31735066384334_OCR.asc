Improving the quality of
education at Pitt should be the
primary goal of the Student
Government Board, according
to SGB president-elect Josh
Baylson.

“I think our focus should be
on academics,” Baylson said in
an interview Friday. “No
matter what you study or
whatever extracurricular activi-
ties you are interested 'in,
everybody comes here to take
classes and get an education. It
is the quality of that education
that is the most important thing
to all students.”

Along with incumbent board
member Dave Hesidence, Bayl-
son and newly elected members
Bernie Popko, Sharon Starzyn-
ski, Stan Galanski, Diane
Behers and Jan Medoff are to
be inaugarated at 6:15 tonight
in the Student Union Ballroom.

Baylson said he would like to
see the board concentrate on
projects directed toward stu-
dents as a whole, and not just

" small interest groups on
campus.

Baylson: Academics
Should be SGB Focus ‘

“Our priorities should be
things that touch every student,
and then, if there are isolated
problems, we can work on them
also,’ ’ Baylson said, “but not at
the expense of the larger, more
comprehensive projects. ’ ’

Though Baylson and Hesi-
denee are the only incumbents
on the new board, the
president-elect believes the
new members are experienced
in student government affairs.
Behers is co-chairmanof the
Commuter Committee, Galan-
ski has had contact with the
board through the College
Young Democrats and the
special higher education task
force and Popko is secretary of '
the SGB assembly.

“Jan Medoff is new to
student government,” Baylson
said. ‘ ‘He is a very bright fellow
and he is picking up a lot of
things very‘ quickly.”

Baylson asserted the board
would be able to begin work
without any transition prob-
lems, citing the new members?
experience with student gov-
ernment. ' 7

“We will have a shorter
orientation period and a shorter
budget period (due to changes
in the allocations. process) than
in past years,” he said. “This
can give us two or three more
months of workingrtime.”

Baylson praised outgoing
president Bernie Payne for his
diligence in bringing about an
end to the state appropriations
crisis last fall.

“We need to continue that
type of focus on the University
budget and the state budget,”
he said.

United Mine Workers Union

claimed he would never agree with
coal companies on a contract that
cuts back on employee health or

Pitt students will feel the effect of
rapidly rising chocolate prices when
they purchase candy from vending
machines on campus.

According to Tom Halbert,
director of Pitt's food service, a
chocolate “price war” has forced a
five-cent increase in candies in half
of the candy machine slots. He said
the recent increase originated when

doesn’t agree with our demands,
unless you want me to. And I’m sure
you don’t want me to.”

The gathering, attended by
miners out 54 days in protest of the
halting of health insurance, unsafe
working conditions and cutbacks in
retirement benefits, marked the
opening of a week of support-solicit-

Pitt Gymnast Litigation
Sways Disability Bill

By NANCY J . WINTNER
Pitt News Staff Writer

An ongoing case of litigation involving Pitt was one of two precedents
that led to the recent introduction of a student disability bill in the State
Legislature, according to Sen. Robert J ubelirer, the bill’s primary
sponsor.

The bill, which would provide catastrophe insurance to students
disabled in school activities, resulted from the cases of Thomas
Cardomone Jr., a former Pitt gymnast, and Ed Chupek, a Somerset
County resident. Both men are now quadrapelegics as a result of their
accidents.

Cardomone, 26, fell from exercise rings while trying to perform a
special maneuver called the “dislncate” in Trees Hall gym in October
1972. He suffered spinal injuries that paralyzed him from the shoulders
down.

After a series of unsuccessful negotiations with Pitt officials,
Cardomone’s family sued the University for alleged negligence.
According to Thomas Cardomone Sr., Pitt offered to settle out of court
last year, but later reneged on the offer. ‘

Chupek, 45, suffered spinal injuries at age 18 after a football game at
Center City High School in Pennsylvania.

J ubel-irer said Chupek, who has been active and “full of life” despite
his disability, “deeply inspired” him to introduce the legislation.

“Chupek was the motivating force,” Jubelirer said, “but the Pitt
student made it even more clear that something had to be done. Why
should any person disabled in any catastrophic accident in any
state-related institution depend onwelfare and others when we (the
state) should do something about it?” I

The legislation, if ratiﬁed, would pay up to $2,500 of a victim’s
medical expenses, and would provide $250 per month for the duration of
a student’s disability.

try to pin them down, they don’t

Miller had originally met with
bituminous coal officials prior to the
Dec. 6 contract expiration date, but
said it “was clear to me that they
didn’t want to draw up a new
contract.”

“They felt that we were weak. I
told them ‘If you want a strike for 5
four or six weeks, then you’ll get it.

If you want us to roll over and p1ay_r“'.

Talks have been sporadic be-
tween the union and coal com-
panies, but meetings have ceased
because of, according to Miller,
large stockpiles of coal.

“Because of all the stockpiling
of coal,” he said, “we’re not in the
best of conditions.” They thought
they could wait a strike out. Now
they’re running to governors
saying, ‘You have to go down there
and make them work.’

“But I believe our members wi1l~
stand ﬁrm. We want to make sure
that the companies don’t discrimi- .
nate or mistreat coal miners. We
want our demands—-there will be no
coal- mining done until a contract
has been drawn.”

Diapers Solution to Charleston Horse Problem

CHARLESTON, S.C.—They can’t seem to get the knack of
toilet-training, so horses in Charleston are being corraled into
diapers.

“Shows what a dumb city we got,” says Henry Waagner, 80,
dean of the city’s horse-and-carriage operators.

Waagner says he doesn’t know how the new city ordinance, which
goes into effect Wednesday, will affect the tourists, who ride in the
carriages. But he knows Mike, his pale sorrel, doesn’t look good in a
diaper.

The diaper that Henry and Mike have been experimenting with is
big and black.

Bird Plaintiff in Hawaiian Suit

HONOLULU—-—A bird——a palila bird, to be speciﬁc—-is suing
Hawaii.’s department of land and natural resources.

The palila, an endangered Hawaiian species, is listed as the
plaintiff in a Federal lawsuit requesting the removal of goats and
sheep from the birds’ environment on the slopes of the Mauna Kea
volcano.

The lawsuit was ﬁled on the birds’ behalf by the Sierra Club, the
Audubon Society and a museum expert on Hawaiian birds.

The defendant controls most of Mauna K.ea’s slopes on the island
of Hawaii.

The suit asks that sheep and goats be removed in the area
between 7,000 and 10,000, feet above sea level on Mauna Kea.

The animals are accused of eating the sprouts of young trees on
which the rare birds feed.

Flight Attendant ‘Sours' Hiiacker

WILMINGTON, N.C.—An airline ﬂight attendant who threw a
whiskey sour in a hijacker’s face, enabling other crew members to
overpower him, said Sunday, “It wasn’t courageous. I was just
scared and I wanted to end the entire incident.

“You just have to do what you do in times of emergency,” said
Steve Addona, a 5-foot-6-inch, 120-pound ﬂight attendant for
Piedmont Aviation of his action aboard Flight 964 Saturday night.
“Nobody wanted to come out a hero.”

Ten passengers and a crew of four were aboard the ﬂight, which
had originated in Cincinnati and was destined after a series of stops
to terminate in Wilmington. M T -

Stunned by the drink, the hijacker, whosaid he had a gun and
wanted to go to Havana, Cuba. was wrestledto. the ground by the
crew after the plane had passed Wilmington and was headed south.
Once he was subdued, the plane turned back and landed at
Wilmington, where FBI agents and local authorities seized the man.

Jubelirer said he would like the
bill to compensate for higher
expenses, but that there now is a
problem in obtaining revenues.

The bill would be ﬁnanced by a
Disabled Sudents Compensation
Trust Fund, in which the state
would set aside two percent of the
money raised through the cigarette
tax.

“I don’t think any cigarette user
would be upset. The money has to
be obtained from somewhere,”
Jubelirer said.

Jubelirer said he first thought
appropriations could be obtained
through Pitt and Penn State, but
that the schools financial situation
this year precluded this.

The fund, administered by the
state Department of Education,
would eliminate a victim’s needto
resort to welfare. It also would
substantially decrease liability in-

~ surance for state-related institu-

tions.

Alden Bowen, coordinator of
Pitt’s Student Judicial System,
strongly supports the proposed
legislation.

“If the state is mandating

'- everyone to go to school, then why

shouldn’t they turn around and do
something if someone gets in-
jured?”

Jack Hayes, director of Pitt’s
Veteran Affairs, said a person has
one chance in six of becoming
permanently disabled by age 65.

' For this reason, he said he believes

disability insurance should be
mandatory for everyone.

“It is expensive,” Hayes said.
“But I’d rather pay $18 a month
than pay $60,000 for an operation,a
wheelchair and other expenses.”

Bowen said the trust fund would
provide victims with money direct-
ly, and would eliminate litigation
procedures that are complicated
and often expensive.

When asked if Cardomone would
benefit from the legislation, if
passed, Bowen said, “not unless its
retroactive. ’ ’

Besides the Cardomone case,
Bowen said he is not aware of any
other incidents at Pitt in which a
student has been permanently
disabled as a result of a school

activity.
“But I am aware of several
situations (at other schools),”

Disabled Student Bill Initiated

Bowen said. “It’s unfortunate we
have to get down to issues at fault,
given the wide range of resources
available. Public institutions are not
equipped to pay compensation and
medical expenses. It would be much
better if we had a piece of
legislation.”

Bowen also said the bill would
benefit persons involved in “quasi-
legal" cases. He cited the example
of school ﬁeld trips, which seldom
are taken because faculty members
fear the medical expenses that may

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

A-Minor Uproar

An Op/Ed column published in last Wednesday’s Pitt News has
generated an unusual amount of controversy, some of it gratifying,

some of it a bit troubling.

Columnist

Julie Graham’s article,

“.Israeli Expansion and

Palestinian Rights,” has been the subject of this minor uproar. In
her article, Graham was critical of what “she calls “Zionist
aggression.” She expressed her hope that Egypt, presently engaged
injnegotiations with the Israelis, would rejoin the “rejectionist”
group of Arab nations and seek peace in that fashion.

Judging by reader response, Graham’s Mid—East report is not
universally accepted. This page is today devoted to three letters

challenging Graham’s position on the Arab-Israeli conflict. As
always, we are happy to publish letters thattake issue with the

views expressed by Pitt News columnists.

We are disturbed, however, by some of the telephone calls we’ve
received in connection with Graham’s article. People have called
(how many have also written, we’re not sure) and have told us we
“shouldn’t print that kind of thing.” Charges of anti—Semitism

" have been leveled at individual members of our editorial staff.

These readers are reminded of the statement appearing in the
masthead‘ at the bottom of this page: “Signed opinions (that IS,‘
articles with a by-line) are not necessarily those of this newspaper.”

More important, we think we have the responsibility to provide a

forum open to writers who bring unpopular,’ unorthodox or,

minority perspectives to campus, local, national and international
issues. Conservatives, moderates, liberals and people who don’t fit
any of these categories write opinion columns for The Pitt News.
This may well be the only large-circulation paper in Pittsburgh
open to,. for instance, a columnist from the radical Left.~ -

T So we hope our readers understand our commitment to editorial
diversity on the Op/Ed pages. While we appreciate the opportunity
to print rebuttals such as those appearing today, we also insist upon
the legitimacy of our attempt to publish as many responsible points

of view as possible.

  Letters To The Editor

A One -Eyed Reading of Mid-East History

Julie (:paham’s continued one-
eyed rea ng of Middle East history
(Wednesday*Jan. 25) becomes a,
fascinating example of “l-don’t-
see-what-I-don’t-want-to-see,” or,
"don’t-confuse-me-with-the-facts-
I’ve-made-up-my-mind.”

‘Graham refers to Israel’s taking
land from the Palestinians in 1948,
and the continued expansion of
Israel by taking land from
surrounding countries. 'She has
conveniently omitted to mention
that Israel was attacked on the very
day of its birth as a legitimate nation
among nations by all its surround-
ing Arab neighbors: an overwhelm-

Those Tired Cliches of the New Left

In her article in the Jan. 25 Pitt
News, Julie Graham presents a
distorted and, unfortunately, an all
too familiar view of the Middle East
crises, a view that bears the tired
cliches of the New Left’s “anti-
Zionism.” In substance it is almost
totally lacking in objectivity and
historical validity.

Graham states that Israel “...is
not, and never has been prepared to
deal (with the Palestinians).”. She
characterizes Israel as an expan-
sionist state, which began in 1948
by taking “...the land given to the
Palestinians, causing them tr.
become refugees. ’ ’ Graham may be
interested to know that the partition
plan of 1948 called for the
establishment of a Palestinian state
side by side with Israel, a plan
allowing both peoples their own
homeland. True, in terms of square
mileage, the Jewish state received
more land, but most of this was
desert. The Arabs received far
more arable land, including the
fertile Jordan Valley. The plan also
made sense demographically, with
the Jewish state having a majority
of Jews and the proposed Arab state

having a majority of Palestinian
Arabs.

‘ But out of all the Mid-Eastem
states, only Israel agreed to the
plan. Only Israel recognized the
“legitimate national rights of the

Palestinians.” It stood alone and ‘

watched as ﬁve Arab armies, in an
outragous act of premeditated
aggression, destroyed all hope for
the Arab state by invading from all
sides. . Their goal was the total
destruction of the State of Israel,
knowing full well that such an act
spelled certain doom for the
stillborn Arab homeland. Some
Palestinians died in the ensueing
ﬁghting, many ﬂed at the urgings of
their Arab brethren with the hope of
returning once the Jewish state was
exterminated and many, caught
amid the ravages of a highly
emotional conﬂict, were driven out.

Their present plight, wasting away.
by the thousands in refugee camps
is unfortunate, but I think that
Ghoury, then Secretary of the Arab
Higher Command, said it best when
he told The Beirut Telegraph on

consequence of the act of the Arab
states in opposing partition and the
Jewish state.”

It should be noted that after the
war, the West Bank, which was to
compose about 75 percent of the
Arab state, was annexed by Jordan
with no objections raised by any
country of the Middle East, save
Israel. This annexation, a further
act of Arab hostility and aggression,
virtually ended all hope for the Arab
state. True, Israel did take control
of the West Bank following the Arab

_ aggression of 1967, but, today, the

West Bank stands closer to being
((‘rim‘ir«'m>// rm‘ Purze 9)

ing force taken from a populations
of over 47 million against ‘a
population of less than two million;
that Israel fought the 1948 war alone
and ﬁnally was able to push back the
Arab invaders; that Israel was again
attacked by Arab countries on all
her borders in 1956, 1967 and 1973,
each time pushing the aggressors
back and securing her originally
fragile and tenuous borders.

Graham conveniently ignores the
Palestine Liberation Organization’s
stated position that Israel must be
destroyed and pushed into the sea.
She does not report that when the
Arab nations surrounding Israel
attacked the newborn state in" 1948,
the Government of Israel pleaded
with the Arab population to remain
(and many did so), but Arab
propag-anda called upon the Arab
population of Israel to leave so that
the invaders could conquer the
country, and give it all back to the
Palestinians.

She does not indicate, of course,
how the Arab nations to which the
Palestinians ﬂed have kept the
refugees in their pitiable state (with
a few minor exceptions); calling on
world resources to support the
Palestinian population, nor does
she mention the swollen refugee
rolls whereby rations and financial
support are provided to “refugees’ ’
who have long since died or left‘ the
area. Nor does she point out that

the world community continues to
support the Palestinians in refugee
camps while the oil sheikhs of the
Middle East use their ‘swollen
ﬁnancial resources to feather their
own nests or to bolster totalitarian
regimes rather then to help their
impoverished brethren. One
percent of the daily oil income of the
Arab states would match the annual
cash contributions from the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency,
which is used to support the_
refugees (an agency, incidentally,
to which the Arab states barely
contribute).

She ignores the 800,000 Jewish

refugees (200,000 more than theajli

number of Arab refugees who left
Israel) who had to ﬂee from

A Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen,

Syria, Iraq and other Arab countries
and whose property was conﬁscat-
ed; who were taken in by the
Government of Israel and absorbed’
into the economy and life of the
country at a time when that
ﬂedgling state could barely support
its own indigenous population.

There is more, much more, that
can be said about the Middle East
situation, but I fear that one cannot

describe color or form to a person

who cannot (or will not) see.

George Plutchok

The Catchword is Self-Determination  

This season's catchword is
self-deterinination. While some
individuals have repeatedly equat-
ed this term solely with the
“rights” of the Palestinian people,
we offer that we should be much
more egalitarian; let us insist that
all of the people of the world be
given the same opportunity. We
must demand self-determination
for the Reuthenians, Serbians,
Croats, Bulgars, Armenians, Slavs,

_Hutus, Tootsis, Kurds, Biafrans,
Ukrainians, Zulus, Hopis,‘ Kash-
mirans, Tibetians, Scots, Irish,
Belizians and the people of Quebec.
The list goes on. ‘

The Kurds have certainly suffer-
ed at the hands of the Turks,
Syrians, Iranians and Iraqis. What
was once a ﬂourishing nation has
been reduced systematically to a
handful of mountain-bound refu-
gees. The Armenians were ruth-
lessly slaughtered by the Turks, and
the Irish are still ﬁghting the
British. The Hutus and the Tootsis
have been massacring one another
for dozens. of years in Burundi, and
almost everyone is familiar with the

.ill.-fated .Biafra:i ‘ﬁght‘~fdr'.iii’de'peh=-

dence from Nigeria. All of these
people have two things in common:
They are ﬁghting a losing battle for
self-determination, and the world is
oblivious to their efforts.

On the other hand, there is
currently a trend to support certain
Palestinian aspirations and to focus
the blame for the plight of these
people on Israel. But diatribe is one
thing, and historical reality is
another.

The Israeli war of independence
began in 1948 when the combined
armies of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon,
Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and

’ Yemen invaded the new-bornstate.

A great deal of territory mandated
by the United Nations to both the
Jews and the Palestinians was
captured by the invading Arab
armies. In 1949, King Abdullah of
Jordan annexed the occupied West
Bank. Similarly, King Farouk of
Egypt annexed the occupied Gaza
Strip.

For the next 19 years, the
Palestinians living in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip were housed in
refugee camps. They were entitled

_'ft6 se’e:ki'e‘zn15lbyine§nt‘ bnly‘ within  

these camps, and they risked
imprisonment if they were caught
working on the outside.

For 19 years, Jordan and Egypt
refused to grant autonomy or
self-determihation to the Palestin-
ians living in these occupied
regions.

Israel has been the ﬁrst and only

Palestinian question on its own
territory. Only Israel has offered to
grant the Palestinians self-rule in
both the West Bank and Gaza.
Egypt and Jordan hardly can make
the same claim.

Another popular myth is that the
Palestine Liberation Organization is
the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people. The PLO was
recognized as the sole representa-
tive of the Palestinians by the Arab
League at the 1969 Rabat Confer-
ence. These nations of the Arab
League are the same nations that
refused to recognize the rights of
the Palestinians for almost two
decades. At no point in time have
the Palestinians indicated that they
are pleased with this selection, nor

APO Fraternity R

By BETSY BECK

While most people have heard
the word autism, few people know
what it is or what problems face an
autistic child. Pitt’s chapter of
Alpha Phi Omega (APO), a national
service fraternity, is trying to call
attention to the problem and to raise
money for the Autistic Society.

Autistic children are aloof and
distant; they seem to have little
interest in what is going on around
them. This is made evident by their

lack of facial expression and their
short attention spans. The autistic
child often spends hours doing one
thing over and over again; the most
common activity is rocking.
Another common trait is a sudden
burst of laughter or tears for no
apparent reason.

What is often forgotten is that
autistic children usually have
average IQ’s. Some are superior in
math, able to add large columns of
numbers in their heads.

To be a member of the Autistic
Society, one must have an autistic
child. This‘ practice helps to insure
the money raised will go directly to
aid the problem, especially to
much-needed research.

In an attempt to educate people
about autism, APO raised $500 to
purchase a set of books about
autism, which are now in the
Graduate School of Public Health.
Other money raised by APO went to
a Pitt student pursuing her
education in teaching the autistic.

Baylson stated the board will try
to establish a permanent student
lobby in Harrisburg. He expressed
hope the task force for higher
education would become a more
integral part of lobbying operations
as a new standing committee of
SGB.

“We would like to take the task
force and make it a public
affairs/governmental relations
committee of SGB—make it a
permanent arm of student govern-
ment,” said Baylson. “We need to
develop a constant, year-round
state lobbying effort. We will
probably send six people to
Harrisburg every two weeks just to
meet with different legislators.”

He indicated the commuter

' situation would be an important

interest of the new board.

“The big problem with com-
muters has been that of communica-
tions,” Baylson said. “We have not
been able to effectively convey to
commuters what we do or how they
can avail themselves of those
services.” .

Baylson cited the “Commuter

Union renovations as assets to the
commuter population.

The SGB will buy half-page ads in
The Pitt News once a week,
according to Baylson, and use the
“student government corner” to
inform commuters of SGB plans.

“I hope, through announce-
ments, advertisements, memos and
letters we can inform the entire
student body, but especially
commuters better as to what we are
doing.” -

Baylson expressed conﬁdence
the new board would be able to work

effectively with the University
administration.
“The board this past year

probably has had better relations
with the administration and faculty
than many boards in the past,”
Baylson said.

“I think they (administration
ofﬁcials) will retain that beneﬁcial
attitude toward us. I think we need
to maintain that because we can
more effectively reach our goals and
accomplish what we want.”

Jam Looks toEarIy Who in “Modern Worl ” 

ByJIMFARERI

Pitt News Staff Writer
This Is the "Modern World
In the City
The Jun
Polydor

The Jam, in many ways, is a
1960’s revivalist band. Parallels to
the early Who--black mohair suits
and mod haircuts--abound. How-
ever, this is not a novelty band for

 

the 1960’s. The Jam’s power,
energy and creativity overﬂow into
new dimensions worth noticing.

The principal member of this
young English trio is lead
singer-guitarist Paul Weller. At,l9,
Weller has assimilated a variety of
1960’s rock, rhythm and blues and
pop inﬂuences, and he isn’t afraid
of revealing them verbatim.

This might lead some to say that
The Jam is merely old stuff in a new
package, but not so. Either of the
two Jam albums reveals enough
nuance of sound, style and
sentiment to make them as fresh in
the 1970’s as the first Who album
was more than a decade ago.

The starting point on both albums
is fast rock ’n roll steeped in pop and
rhythm and blues, giving it an easily
recognizable 60’ 5 sound. Where
the music goes from there is largely

a function of how Weller (and
occasionally bassist Bruce Foxton)
manage to write a particular song.
Both “In the City” and “This Is the
Modern World” feature invigorat-
ing, as well as monotonous,
material. -e

The Jam’s debut album, “In the
City,” reveals, like the work of any
budding talent, more promise than
product. But rising from the
awkwardness, three Weller songs
rank as impressive perspectives on
his ability to assimilate old
inﬂuences, into new power, and the
band’s ability to communicate that
power. All 12 tracks show The Jam
as a dynamic and vigorous unit;
their youth pours through the
music.

The latest Jam album, “This Is’
the Modern World,"
much growth as the ﬁrst LP did

promise. Nearly all the numbers
demonstrate a cohesiveness and
direction that the tunes on the
previous album sorely lacked. Even
the play and production has
improved, it being more electric and
precise than on “in the City.”
Without question, the best song

ntertainment

Helping the Jam’s music echo
1960’s British rock are the lyrics,
reveling in notions of youth
oppression, nonconformism and
anger at a sleepy, apathetic world.
“What’s the use in saying
‘destroy’...” asks Weller, contem-
plating a catchword of British punk

shows as .

on both albums is the title track.
Both are fast rock, indicating Weller
may forego his slower, less
successful numbers.

The tunes written by Foxton on
“This Is the Modern World” are
.competent, though stiff, rock.
Weller seems to have the monopoly
on son Qwriting talent.

rock, “...We want a new life forq‘-V

everyone. ’ ’

Weller is better at music than at
lyrics, sometimes being didactic,
sometimes discursive and some-
times just bland. His ideas are
always interesting and a relief from
traditional concerns of rock lyric-
ists.

“turday Night” Hits Target Again

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer '

After almost a season’s worth of disappointing
shows, “Saturday Night Live” finally redeemed
itself, in my eyes, with the past weekend’g
telecast.

I love “Saturday Night”—it’s bitingand
hilarious. But lately, the writing has beenitrite,
the guest hosts (particularly the imbecilic old
woman who won the “Anyone Can Host”
contest simply because of her age) have been dull
and the Not Ready For Prime Time Players
haven’t been funny.

But just as l was ready to trade it in for
“Chiller Theater,” “Saturday Night” was back
in its best tradition.

The Show opened with a parody of Ike and
Tina Turner, retitled Mr. Mike and Tina Revue.
Mr. Mike (writer Michael O’Donoghue)
launched into one of his sick routines about
mutilated animals (this is not funny and should
be dumped), but Garrett Morris, in drag as Tina,
was excellent, doing a spastic dance routine and
belting out “Proud Mary.”

Host Robert Klein’s a welcome addition to any
show, and his monologue about his college days
at an anti-Semetic university was great,

particularly the bit about being chased around
the quad by Nazis.

Later in the show, Klein had a chance to
display his fine talent at mimicry in a spoof of
Jerry Lewis movies. The “Dragnet” satire, with
Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd as a pair of
voyeuristic crime fighters, also was excellent. A
gag about giant lobsters attacking the United
States was suitably loony. Murray revived his
routine about an entertainer in a ski lodge, and it
worked well also.

lt’s a‘ shame “Saturday Night” dropped
several tried and true routines. lt’s nice to go for
new acts, but Emily Litella of the malaproping
news commentaries and “The Coneheads” are
just too good to let go, especially when the
replacement is something likethe “Roseann
Rossanadanna” routine introduced recently.

This reaching for new acts may bewhat is
causing problems for “Saturday Night.” Very
few of the innovations are working. The changes
in the “Weekend Update” skit——having Jane
Curtain and Akroyd as c0—anchOrpersOns—
seems to waste both, particularly Akroyd.

A lot depends on the “Saturday Night” host.
It seems that when someone like Klein or Lily
Tomlin is featured, the humor_works a lot better.
When actors like Buck Henry or Shelley

Plimpton are on,

the quality drops. Ray , 7']
Charles’ time on the show was punctuated with a
lot of dull blind jokes; Elliot Gould is invariably
great. Each host is a calculated risk, but it would
be nice to see more of Klein.

Theater Reopened , 

CarterA ttends  

WASHINGTON-—-President and
Mrs. Carter welcomed more than
400 guests to a White House
reception Sunday "evening to
celebrate the 10th anniversary of
the reopening of historic Ford’s
Theater. And to one guest, Carter’s
receiving line pleasantries were
special.

“I’m glad to have you back,’’

Carter said to actress Eartha Kitt,
who has not been at the White
House since 1968, when she gave
her outspoken views against the
Vietnam War to a shocked Lady
Bird Johnson.

“I took that as a personal
message,” Miss Kitt said of the
President's words.

Joining the Carter’s on the
receiving line were House Speaker
Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill and his
wife, Millie, who was the chair-
woman of the Ford’s Theater gala.

Miss Kitt, whohas been starring
in the musical “Timbuktu” at the
Kennedy Center, joined the crowd
in the East Room where Carter
praised the theater’s many sup-

Guests included Henry Fonda,
Cliff Robertson,. Lorne Greene,
Melba Moore, and Vincent Price,
who said he first came to the White
House when Franklin Roosevelt was
President. “And I’m still always so
impressed,” Price said.

The President and Mrs. Carter
were invited to attend t e
performance, featuring excel? ‘
from shows that have’ beé.._..
presented at Ford’s, which is 10
blocks from the White House.

Mrs. O’Neill estimated that she
expected ticket sales for the gala at
the theater would bring at least
$250,000.

In addition, Ford’s will receive
$100,000 from NBC, which will
carry the program on its network at
9 p.m. EST next Thursday.‘

Graham further condemns Israel
for its refusal to deal with the
Palistine Liberation Organization.
This refusal, according to Graham,
is further evidence of Israel’s
“stubbornness.” For the record,
Israel has not refused to negotiate
with all the Palestinians, just the
PLO. Why? Because the

Panther-Trocksters Leave |nvitotiono|’Foes in the Dust  

By MARIA SCIULL0
‘ Pin News Sta fr writer

The Pitt Panthers looked impres-
sive in their indoor invitational track
meet this past weekend, managing
to outscore more than a dozen other
schools in an unofﬁcial team point
count.

Pitt won four events and placed
second in four others to overcome
some outstanding individual perfor-

_.mances by East Carolina and East

Tennessee.

Senior Tom Herrmann’s 4209.7
mile excited the home crowd. He
pulled away from a pack of runners
on the ﬁnal lap to win by several
yards, followed by Cleveland
State’s Mark Hunter, an all-Amer-
ica cross-country runner.

“I was very pleased with Tom’s ’

race, ” said coach Mike Agostinella,
“but I was not aware our distance

‘,

Sports

squad was that far along this early
in the season. At any rate,‘ I
wouldn’t be surprised if Tom comes
down to the four-minute mark
soon.” 2

Half an hour later, Herrmann ran
a 1:56.9 split on his leg of the
two-mile relay. In this event, Jack
Cade (l:58.5), Roger Winstanley
(1:59.8) and anchorman Rich Moore
(1:56.5) combined efforts for a time
of 7:52.6, fast enough for ﬁrst place.

The Panthers’ two other victories
came in the pole vault and high
jump. Freshman Gene Roach set a
new Pitt record by vaulting 14 feet

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.——Dr.
Naismith meant basketball to be a

With four starters and reserve

 Dave Olinger registering in double

ﬁgures, Pitt converted more than 50

for the third game in a row,
ﬁnishing the current roadtrip 2-1.

in three league outings and 10th
overall, came in spite of some

The Panthers,’however, found a

’ kept Pitt competitive under the

boards; when Harris was forced to

 the bench by fouls, Olinger and

Terry Knight provided the neces-
sary long-range artillary.

Knight was just short of
automatic throughout the game,
converting seven of nine ﬁeld goal
attempts, and two for two from the
charity stripe, for a total of 16
points.

Scheuermann had a frustrating
evening on the offensive end of the
ﬁoor, misﬁring on all of his seven
ﬁeld goal attempts, but his eight
rebounds was second on the team to
Harris’s 10.

10 inches; high jumper Dan

’ Goodyear successfully defended his

invitational title by clearing 6-8.

Second-place honors were award-
ed to the Panthers’ Mel Boyd
(8:55.9 in the two-mile), Dave
McDonald (14:19.3 in the three-
mile) and Ed Taylor (5.4 in the
50-yard dash, plus a 23-11 showing
in the long jump).

Capturing third place shots were

Baker (6-2, high jump) and Mike
Wallace (48-1, shot put). The mile
relay of Larry Shippen, Greg
Conover, Bud Cooper and Keith

The ﬁrst half was, for the most
part, a shooting clinic conducted by
Penn State’s Jeff Miller. The 6-2
senior guard ran around picks set up
by his teammates until he freed
himself, and his marksmanship was
amazing. While Miller was scoring
20 ﬁrst-half points on better than 80
percent shooting, the rest of the
Lions could only manage six ﬁeld
goals on 20 attempts.

Pitt countered in the second half
both offensively and defensively
with Wayne Williams. Leading the
team with 19 points, Williams
penetrated enough to force the
defense to collapse, and was deadly
with the jump shot from wherever

the opportunities came. Defensive- L

ly, Williams spent the entire
second half inside Miller’s jersey,
as the Penn State captain shot a cool
three for nine down the stretch.

“It was deﬁnitely the Wayne
Williams show in the second half,”
Pitt coach Tim Grgurich said. “If
that kid (Miller) could play against
us every night, he’d be an
all-America. He shoots the hell out
of our team, but in the second half,
Wayne just went out and shut him
off.”

Penn State repeatedly tried to
apply man-to-man PI‘eSSl11'€ defens-
ively,but, like so many other teams
that have faced the Panthers, had
no one who could match up with
Harris. The Panther swingman
tallied 18 points, to go with his 10
rebounds and fouled Steve Kuhn,
the only Nittany Lion other than
Miller to crack double ﬁgures, out of
the game.

The only thing Kuhn was able to
do with Harris was watch him score,

Leckenby placed fourth, with splits
of 49.9 .and 50.3 for Shippen and
Cooper. With a time of 10.13.9,. the
distance medley relay squad was
also fourth. Willis Shannon (1:58.9)
ran the 880 leg, Wayne Hursen
(51.8) the 440, Dan Dattilo (3:08.8)
3/4 of a mile and Gary Siriano
(4:13.3) anchored with a mile run.
Leon Milnes (48’11”), Keith Taylor
(47’7”), Jack Cade (2:l6._1) and
Mark Studnicki (14:32.1) placed in
the shot put, triplejump, 1,000-yard
run and three-mile, respectively.

Jumper Don Maydak turned in
personal bests of 22-6 in the long
jump and in the triple jump. The
latter mark placed him ﬁfth in the
competition. Keith Taylor (6-2) and
Keith Bookert (16.6) ﬁnished fifth in
the high jump and hurdles.

East Tennessee’s Ray Flynn was
the only double winner, racing to

as Penn State’s number-two scorer
either found himself with a perfect

view of a Harris jumper, or faked _
helplessly into the ‘air about to

commit another foul.

Clancy continues to draw oohs 
and ahhs from opposing fans, g
levitating his frame above the crowd 
to snatch rebounds and rattle the 
foundations with his dunks. Though 
ﬂu-weakened, Clancy was still a
tower of strength under the 
and the outside 
shooting touch is improving with ;

backboards,

each game.

 

“The key to our success lately ha
been our balance,” Grgurich said
“Ideally, we want ﬁve guys to score
in double ﬁgures every game.

“A tough ballclub is what we
want at the end of the year. We’re
getting there.”

Sub Kline Lets Mot Victory-Slide Away

Bv KAREN KADILAK

I-fm News Staff Write:
50 close. yet so tar away.
Pitt wrestler Jackie Kline must

have been thinking along those.

lines Thursday after he lost a 7-4
decision to defending national titlist
Andy Zook in the 134-pound weight
division match during the Panthers’
30-8 win over the Millersville
Marauders at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

Kline, ﬁlling in for ﬂu-weakened
Rande Stottlemyer for the third
straight meet, had victory snatched
away from him several times during
his match with the defending NCAA
Division II national champion.

“I got him on his back several,

9)

times, Kline said. “And
everytime I did get him on his back,
I slid right off. In the third period, I

had him on his back again. At that
point, he wanted to win. He gave up
a point for stalling in the third
period. He just pinned my head.
From then, he just coasted in on
riding time.”

Kiine’s match with Zook was
billed as the top encounter of
Thursday’s meet. The Panthers,
coming off a 21-12 loss to
nationally-ranked Lehigh last Sat-
urday, needed this meet to stay one
match over the .500 mark heading
into Wednesday’s home meet with
Clarion.

The must-win situation made
Kline's match with the Millersville
wrestler all the more important.

“Coach (Dave Adams)~told me
after the match I did a beautiful
job,” Kline said. “The way I was

wrestling, Zook had to be worried
from the start about whether he was
going to win or not. The pressure
was on him in that sort of situation.
It wasn’t on me.”

Thursday’s match with Zook had
to be a morale-boosting one for
Kline. After taking Stottlemyer’s
place at Temple two weeks ago,
Kline had dropped a disappointing
4-1 decision to Lehigh’s Greg
Cunningham. Against Cunning-
ham Kline was off the mat more
than he was on it in what was his
most disappointing showing of the
season.

“I was a little more psyched for
this match,” Kline said. “Last
week, I respected Cunningham’s
strength. Most of the time, I’m
wrestling underweight. So, when I

get akid who’s bigger than I am, I’ll
dive behind his legs and get him
that way. But I couldn’t do that last
week against Lehigh.

“I moved against Zook,” Kline
continued. “Zook dropped down
from the 142-pound weight class.

So, he’s really not as quick as most"

134-pounders. Still, I couldn’t get
as slick against Zook as I can against
some wrestlers. He's too good of a
wrestler to fall for that.” -

Kline isn’t sure if, and in what
weight class, he’ll wrestle against
Clarion Wednesday. Stottlemyer
may return to wrestle Clarion’s
Randy Miller (Miller is an old
nemesis of Stottlemyer’s; Stottle-

” myer pulled out an exciting

one-point decision over Miller at the

season.) If Stottlemyer does refg§-’,,’
Kline, ‘who has recovered fully frig
a July appendectomy and an
early-season hip pointer, could drop
to the 126-pound weight division.
For Kline to do that, the
sophomore from Harrisburg would
have to dislodge Jose Martinez,
who has 5-3-2 record despite
dropping a 10-7 decision against
Millersville, in practice this week.

“I’ll ﬁnd out in the next few days
what I’ll be doing against Clarion,”
Kline said. “If Rande returns. I'll
probably wrestle Martinez in an
elimination match during practi 
sometime this week. The way I am
feeling now, I think I can eliminate
Jose. But, like I said, we’ll have to
see how things go in practice as to

Pitt’s men and women gymnasts
teamed up for a double dose of
victory Saturday at Trees Hall,
compliments‘ of the Slippery Rock
State Rockets. The men chalked up
a Pitt record-breaking performance
of 184.90-170.80 while the women
turned in a 134.95-128.66 decision.

Men’s head coach Frank D’Am-
ico attributed the record-breaking
showing to teamwork, and wasn’t
able to single out an outstanding
performance. Freshman Allan My-
ers from Churchill added to his
string of standout performances by
clinching the all-around portion of
the mens’ meet, despite a severely
bruised foot.

In the women’s meet, freshman
Myra Bachuchin captured three
ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes—vau1ting, with
a score of 9.3; balance beam, with
an 8.8 and all-around competition,
with a 34.8.

Freshman teammate Bonnie

Schuman and Bob. Greenwald
began the meet by winning the
medley relay with a 3234.5 time.

Schuman took the 200-yard butter-
ﬂy in 1:59.71. Swanson won the

200-yard backstroke in 1:56.48, four “X

and Orlando Catinchi (2:14.26) put

<IK

Tressler had two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes
on the uneven bars and a ﬁrst-place
tie with last year’s MVP, Regina
Carson, in the free exercise portion
of the meet with a 8.77 score.
Tressler also had a second-place in
the all-around with a 8.55.

Women’s coach Donna DeMarino
said she was pleased with the
performance of her 20th-ranked
team.

“We really had some improved
performances against Slippery
Rock,” DeMarino said. Alison
Hoburg is recovering nicely after
knee surgery, and Regina Carson
has been steadily improving with
each meet.

“Slippery Rock was as close a
match as we expected it to be,
however,” DeMarino continued.
“They had been scoring around 131
or 132 in their previous meets.”

When asked to comment on the
past week’s national rankings by
the National Statistical Service for
Gymnastics (coaches) poll, DeMar-

ino said she was pleased yet
perplexed.

“West Virginia University was

ranked 16th, ahead of us, even
though we just beat them last

week,” she said. “I was happy
about the ranking, but I feel
because Pitt is a new team in a
tough conference we are going to
have a hard time getting the
recognition we deserve. When
there are top teams like Clarion and
Penn State in our region, it’s going
to be hard to get the publicity.”

California State University at
Fullerton, California, was ranked as
the number-one team in the nation,
with Clarion second and Penn State
occupying the third slot. The
