An increase in the Univer-
sity contribution to the_ retire-

ment program ‘of participat-

ing faculty members was an-
nounced by Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald at the —Fall
meeting of the University
Senate in Foster .Memorial last
Friday afternoon. ,

Chancellor Fitzgerald in speak-

ing‘ to approximately 300 faculty
members announced that the Ex-

ecutive Committee of the Board‘

of Trustees had" approved a rec-
ommendation_ that the University
increase its payrnenttto’ faculty re-
tirement from 5 percent to ‘71/2
percent.

Salary Increase

’In order not to ‘cause undue
hardship,‘ the Board of Trustees
further recommended that a sal-
ary increase of 2% percent be

granted the faculty taking part in

the plan. This 21/; percent would
be applied to the increased retire-
ment payment, therefore the take
home pay ‘-would‘ remain the same.
This newiplan will be effective

The news .‘1s that " desirable’

There are also some apartments

apartments which may _be avail-
able in the future. I .
‘William F. Saalbach, assistant
to the dean of men, suggests that

a men looking for rooms “advertise

have done this, he says, and have

received. from 15 to 30 replies.

Thereason students have had
more success when they adver-

In Radio Guild Program

Pitt students now have the opportunity to do radiowork
under actual broadcast conditions. *
’A radio guild is being formed by the Pitt Players to supply

talent to the productions of the

radio workshop class conductecl

by Mrs. Victoria Corey, of the speech department.
. Casting for the weekly program is open to the entire stu-

dent body, according‘ to guild

chairman Murray Harris. Try-

Orchestra Set
To Reorganize

After a lapse of a year, the Pitt
orchestra is being reorganized un-
der the directorship of Robert L.
Arthur.

Candidates, both men and wom-
en, are requested to report to
room 817 between 4 and 5 p.m.,
Friday, Oct. 15. No instruments
will be needed at this meeting.

Primarily a concert orchestra,
it will specialize in symphonic,
concert and light opera music.
Plans are indeﬁnite, but the or-

chestra will present an ‘annual.
_concert and play for University

affairs and district concerts.

Chats with Chancellor Rufus Fitz-‘
gerald this year was taken -by
Senior Court at their first meeting
Oct. 5.

Prior to this term, such chats

seemed slightly impersonal, ac-
cording to some students'attend-
ing. .
' According to the report from
Senior Court, such students rea-
-soned that the number of invita-
.tions extended exceeded the num-
ber necessary for a‘rea_lly person-
al chat with Chancellor Fitzger-
ald. , 4 -

Court decided to cut the num-
ber to eight for the ﬁrst few chats.
If there is no adverse criticism of
the small number of invitations
extended, the policy will remain
in effect for the rest of the year,
according to Chief Justice Lenore
Mussoff. -

Since the ~ open houses
Chancellor Fitzgerald,

with
sponsored

ous classes, met with approval,
three .will. be scheduled during
the Current’ school year; ‘
The. ﬁrst . is tentatively planned
for Sophomore men and women
.during the month of November
Following the ﬁrst Open House
will be one for Junior men and
women. .
‘ Seniors will get an opportunity
to meet their Chancellor soon be-
fore graduation. Because Court
believes Seniors will welco2:., the

°outs will be held Tuesday even-

ings for shows to be done Thurs-
day nights at the KDKA studio.
Guild Answers Need

“The guild is the answer of the
speech department to a need for
more radio courses at Pitt,” Harris
said. Each Week a script written
by one of the students in the ra-
dio class will be rehearsed and re-
corded in studio B, at station
KDKA, under the direction of the
student producers. ‘

The voices needed by the author
will be selected at the Tuesday

night tryouts. It was stressed that
previous radio experience is not

necessary. For the present,’ the.

shows are being recorded, but it

is hoped that sustaining :lIl.l').le.> will
be obtained for actual broadcast.
The News has long. advocated a
radio workshop at Pitt. In a series
of editorials last-_ year, a cam-
pus studio was suggested. Mrs.
Corey, instructor of the radio
classes, said that the Workshop

class would provide the closest
thing to an actual broadcast.

Rehearsals Held

The actors will have a series of
rehearsals before the ﬁnal presen-
tation and will be directed each
week by the author of the script.
Sound effects and music will be
drawn from the‘ facilities of
KDKA. So far, the class has pro-
duced one script and will hold try-
outs this afternoon at 2:30 in the
Pitt Players office. for the next
show. - '

Information about the tryouts
will be posted on the ground ﬂoor
bulletin board in the Pitt Play-
ers’ section. He added that per-
sons unable to attend the tryouts
should leave their names and ad-
dresses in the Players’ office on
the eighth floor of the cathedral.

VA Closes

* SHOUT WHEN IT COUNTS
Anydemonstration of school spirit among the students
here at Pitt shows so seldom that it seems a shame to try to

discourage it.

Certainly it’s nice to win a game. We like to see it as
much as anyone. But We shudder to think what would happen
to the Cathedral and immediate environs if.Panther.gridders

-should defeat a major opponent—say Indiana or Penn State.

But West Virginial! How desperate for acelebration can we

get.

,a-

After all, the Pitt victory didn’t come as such a complete
surprise. Certainly, it was no upset.

For the most part it looked as though the “spontaneous”
demonstration in the Commons Room yesterday was caused
more by a desire to get out of classes than by any real elation

over Saturday’s win. The vast majority of students regarded
the whole thingies silly—and they were right.

\Ve’d like to make a bet that a good percentage of the

demonstrators seldom, if ever, go near a pep rallyto cheer,

the team before a game. The rally preceding’ the Notre Dame
game for instance drew a tremendous throng of 200. \Vhere
was all the spirit then? Probably at home resting.

There’ll be other victories this year to celebrate. Real vic-
tories. And there very well could be some important ones if the
people who ran wild in the Commons Room yesterday just show
as much ‘enthusiasm at cheering the ‘team as they show in ﬁnd-

ing ways to escape class.

A little more lu11g power at the stadium on Saturdays
and a little less iii the Commonsiltoom on ,Mondays might
make a difference in some of the games to come. Try it...

ADD MR. SORENSEN

There isn’t much danger that Arne Sorensen will ever_ suf-
fer from aphobia brought on by fear of crowds. Not, at least,

if he speaks at many such places as the University.
Mr. Sorensen’s recent lecture was witnessed by some 150,
students about half of whom were journalism students who

covered the talk as an assignment. We understand that the
other half was made up mostly of geography studentS-like-

wise assigned to the lecture in lieu of class room work.

Such a magniﬁcent; display of indiﬁerence. One hundred

andtﬁfty students out of 16,000.

It sets us toiwondering again if the students are quite as

mature asthey claimed when they demanded the right to hear
political speakers.

If the response to Mr. Sorenson’s address last Thursday

was-«ran indication,’ we’d be inclined to say “No.”

EVENC A LITTLE HELPS

Perhaps we’re jumping the gun a little with the letter

that appears on the left hand side of the page, but"~we thought
"it might prove of interest to some students, particularly to
those who contributed to last year ’s WSSF and Pitt Chest col-
lections. '

Most students seem to regard such collections as a rather

unnecessaryannoyance—-something to be avoided or, at best,
ignored. But the money that goes to the Pitt Chest and thence
to such relief organizations as WSSF -(‘The World‘St11dent'

Service Fund) means a great deal to those who receive the

beneﬁt of the contributions.

So readthe letter from CAR-E reprinted on this page and

this year.’ _

Even a small contribution on your

helping hand to some student who, like yourself, is trying to: -from a course when absences be_

remember what it says whenthe next Pitt Chest Drive begins

part will give a _big

ferent and far more difﬁcultl: than ours.

  Butler Starts

Honors Course

Indianapolis, Ind.—I. P.—Es-.
tablishment of an honors program
for superior junior and senior stu-
dents at Butler University .which
will permit departments of the
school to hold honors seminars
and the awarding of a new hon-
ors distifiction, honors in course,
upon graduation was announced
here recently by President M. 0.
Ross. A

The new program which will g
into effect this year will provide
a natural, complement to the Uni-
versity College which has proved
successful in the handling of
freshman and sophomore students
at the local university during "the
past threeyears, Dr. Ross said.

iThe honors plan will permit
the establishment of honors sem-
inars of the Swarthnfiore College
type. Students enrolling in the
honors program and seeking the
honors in ‘course distinction_ must:

‘complete all requirements for

graduation including not less than
60 hours earned in Butler Univer-
sity during the junior -and senior
years, maintain an average of 3.6

' in the department in which the

distinction is earned, and success-
fully participate in not less than
two honors seminars.

Under the new honors program
it will be possible for a student to
win honors, cum laude and magna
cum laude. The superior student
who successfully completes at least
two honors seminars and writes a,
thesis will receive the distinction,
magna cum laude with honors in.’
course. ’

Dakota Has .
New Cut Rule

Grand Forks, N. D.—I. P.—The
University of. North Dakota re-
cently took steps to place students
“on their own” in attending
classes, by dropping the rule that
any student missing more than 25
per cent of the class meetings of
one course ‘should automatically
receive a. failing‘ grade in that
course.

This rule had been under ﬁre
by both students. and ‘faculty.
However, to make. certain that‘
students attended classes proper-
ly, the rule that a student may be
dropped from a course when ab-
sences begin seriously affecting a
student’s scholastic standing was
emphasized. —

Only three attendance rules will
affect ‘students hereafter:

1. Students are expected to be‘
present at all_‘ class meetings for
which they areenrolled. Consid-
eration will be given absences due
to illness or other unavoidable
causes. » ‘

2. Absences will be recorded
from the beginning of the semes-

er. ‘ '
3. A student may be dropped

gin seriously to -affect -his or heri
scholastic standing.

the Editor  , C 0

Editor, The Pitt News:

As you will recall, Pitt’s spring
campaign for the relief of needy
students in Europe resulted in
proceeds to W.S.S.F. and to CARE.
Some of these funds" were sent to
France, where’ both W.S.S.F. and

CARE packages.
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, writing

'from,Paris after spending _a day at

the Sorbonne, reported in her col-
umn My Day: ‘

“Our students at home and our
universities who have sent help
to the Corbonne and to the stu-
dents here would be gratiﬁed by_
the remarks made by the presi-
dent of the university in his
speech. He told how much it has
meant ‘to them to receive tons ‘of

dried milk, for example, just be-

fore examinations so that they
could give the students more
nourishment at that particular
time.

“He emphasized his. gratitude-
not just for the material things,
much .as they have nededthem,
but for the spirit of generosity
and affection which has come to
them here from the institutions of
learning in their sister republic of
the United States- , -

,“The Sorbonne president also
made mention of Benjamin.
Franklin and how he ﬁrst came to
speak for the‘United States in this
capital city of Paris. Andthis re-
‘minded me of the fact that John
Golden, who was here for a few
days, made-me walk ‘to the end of
the block of buildings in which,
our hotel stands to ‘show me a_
bronze tablet that commemorates
the fact that in this building Ben-_
jamin Franklin and other Ameri-
can statesmen signed the treaty
that brought us help-from France
in the days when we needed it
more than France needs our help‘
today. ‘

“Our two republics have a long
history -of friendship, and it is
good now, when they need a lift
to their spirits, that we are able
to help them through these ardu-'
ous years. I ‘was only too glad to
be able to thank them not only
for what they did for us years
ago, but of what they have done
in the ﬁelds of literature and the
ﬁne arts for us and for the world
over in’ all the years of their his-
tory.”

Mrs. Roosevelt was invited to
the Sorbonne to address the stu-
dentsthere. I think that contrib-
utors to the WSF—CARE drive.
will be interested in knowing hoW_
their money was spent and with
what eﬁect. -

Cordially yours,

‘CARE ‘representatives distributed _

After the ﬁnal whistle had-
blown at the Pitsburgh-West vir-
ginia game on Saturday certain

students and/or fans again —at--‘

tacked the goal posts and were
successful in removing one ‘up-

right while bending a second tor.
such an extent that it made an ;

angle of‘ approximately twenty

degrees with the ground before a-'

group of defending (?) policemen"
about .the7:.:

arranged themselves

dwyoloping. upright. When further;
attempts were made to ,ren1'o've 1
the bent standard they proudly“

wielded clubs on heads" "and

knuckles in_ a display of “protec-

tionof property” which was both ‘j

-inexcusable as well as‘ disgus_‘ting,;;

to the fans who ‘remained in“the,:..-
stands. The damage had been "dong" ;'
so why not let the students -com‘-j-,3

plete the initiated job?

In at least two .instance:s-indi-up
Vidal officers were seen to use‘

ﬁrst on fanswho had not touch’-‘
ed them or the. goal posts. (It is‘
quite possible that words of un-"

complimentary natures had fbeen. '

dressed as a “hill—billy,” striking

_Are these antics necessary in

Basic psychology teaches that

we generally want what we can’t C

they so desired) it is believed that

There was a converted ﬁintlock,
owned originally by David Shaw,
a pioneer, who used it to help de-
fend I-lannastown, Pa., against
rarr'ipagirig Indians.‘ It is the only
gun left that spoke for the one-

¢One of the guns has an unsua.
tale behind it. The piece is called
the Cartwheel Riﬂe. There were
very few made and only one was
feveriﬁred. Why? On the ﬁrst shot
;the gun exploded and killed its

,An interesting sioelight of Civil
war musketry was the entrench-
ing tool which ﬁtted on the end
of a rifle. Trowel shaped, it was
altogether too shai-p’and too dan-

The pistol section, one of the
ﬁnest in theipworld, had every-

weapons. There was a small cler-
ringer of the type used to assas-
sinate Abraham Lincoln and a
small palm “cuties.” Six shooters
and hand cannons rounded out the
pistol display.

The gun exhibit told an amaz-
ingly difﬁerent story than a history

It takes a heap of livin’ to buck:

a war, a Christian nation turned
pagan, a group of suﬁering epi-
leptics for a year,,and still come
up smiling! ’ A

Ilse Ultsch has used these ex-
periences for background—..in un-
derstanding better the current
YWCA problems. She is today an
‘area secretaryfor the YWCA, in
Hanerau, Germany. ‘ =

Miss Ultsch, a visitor. of the
YWCA at the University, chan-
neled her: work through Pitsburgh
at the close of the ﬁrst interna-
tional study conference related to
Women and World Reconstruc-
tion, held at Columbia University
this past- August.

As a former representative at
this meeting of 50 persons from
26 different countries, Miss Ultsch
is qualiﬁed to present highlights
of the conference. She will also
tell about her pre-war ‘experi-
-ences as a church worker.

At 7:30 tonight, at the Metro-
politan Y, Miss Ultsch will tell
about the Bible Training School
which has been under her super-

 vision for three years.

This is probably foremost in her
mind for this has been her most
recent project. But there are other
stories in her itinerary of a life

. spent in Lutheran Church-YWCA

service.

-Working closely with the Inner
Mission, an auxiliary of the Lu-
theran Church and a state insti-
tution in Germany, she did cleri-
cal work as a YWCA secretary;
she nursed epileptics at a hos-
pital in Bethel, Westhalia; and
adds a bit of drama to her story
-when she speaks of a ﬂight from
the Russian Army. '

‘The war was nearing its end

‘ and Miss Ultsch found herself cut

off from Y headquarters in Koen-
igsburg, by advancing Russian

ﬂed aboard ship to Swinemunde,
and ﬁnally to Hamburg, where
they found comparative safety.

From Hamburg, Miss Ultsch
drew an assignment in Lubeck
where her job became one of
morale. She tried to interest evac-
uees in church sessions, worship
services, and a revived faith. She
still continues this type of work
at her dormitory school in Hane-
rau, a town now swolled from
2,500 inhabitants to one with a
population of over 5,000.

The future of this small school,
now training parish and church
workers, is uncertain, Miss Ultsch
admits. The new tri—zonal cur-
rency system raises tuition almost
beyond the limits of the very
wealthiest student’s purse. 1

There is no doubt that Miss
Ultsch still has hope. “Many times
my students have been sent out

5: ti: =3
in search of nettles to supplement
our meatless, milkless, and but-
terless meals,” Miss Ultsch com-
mented. '

Miss Ultsch has been in Pits-
burgh since Sept. 17. From her
conversations with members and
non-members of the YWCA who
will be guests at the meeting to-
night, she hopes to ﬁnd new ideas
and student support for her in-
creasingly harder task ahead.

Beaindis Drum Maiors Explain
Their Prize-Winning Recipe

By VIVIAN COLONNA

Take one or more batons, add a -

half dozen dance -steps to taste,
spice generously with such nov-
elties as ﬁre and sabers, and mix
together iwith hours of practice.
There you have the recipe for a
successful baton twirler.

”This prize-winning recipe was
2 supplied by_Jarne_s Andrews and
3-fWilliam‘DeLuca, drum majors for

§_the Pittlband, who have used it

‘ witheexpert r_esults. Both Jim, .1

_ whois signal major, and Bill, who

"is twirling major, emphasize that
themost important ingredient is

, the hours of practice.

‘A ‘good critic helps too. .“My
wife is my best critic,” says Jim.
Bill can’t decide which of his fam-
-ily is his best.

note Jumps  

In Enrollment 1

One major exception to the drop
inienrollment at Pitt this year is
the ROTC program.

While registration ﬁgures show
an overall decrease of 1200: stu-
dents this year, the number of
students taking military ‘science
has climbed to a new high of 1117,
according to Colonel John I. Hine-

ke, professor -of militaryscience
P and tactics at the University.‘
The ﬁgures released by Co1.:

. E, .
Hincke show an increase of over

50 per cen_t"'above.the 1947-48"

ROTC ..roster of 710 students.

Of the 1117 cadets in the pro- 0.

gram this year," 333 are iiiair
165 in anti—aircraft ar-
tillery, 142 in the -engineers, 187
in the Quartermaster, and 290
cadets in the medical and dental
corps programs.

9 93E.cIf—8’£76I“ZIv¢‘T5*<10fl3.O ;4epsan.1-. "i'SM!N_ 1.1.14 ~aHJ."’ ,

\
A comparable breakdown of the ‘

enrollment ﬁgures for 1946, the
ﬁrst postwar year’ of advanced
ROTC, listed only 301 "in the ar-
tillery and 150 medical cadets for
a total of 451, less than half the
number now in the ROTC pro-
gram.

Although this year’s enrollment “

represents a great expansion. of
the Pitt corps, it is not much in
excess of the pre-war roster
which usually totalled about 1000
cadets.

The 1948 edition of the ROTC
is a far cry, however, when the

' entire corps totaled only 65.

True, their 47-7 victory over St.
Louis is their only win in three
starts, but their ﬁrst setback was
a close 14-12 affair with Iowa, a
Big Nine school.

The Iowa contest crippled the
Wisconsin citizens, leaving them
easy prey for Detroit, a fast sec-
ond class club. They should, how-
ever, have their steam up for Pitt.

In one respect, Marquette and
Pitt bear -a striking resemblance.
Both schools are second rate foot-.
ball powers but are social climb-
ers and make a practice of hob-
nobbing with the gridiron elite.

Saturdays playing punching bag

State, and Wisconsin, in that or-
der. '

schedule is Frank J. Murray, a stu-
dent of the modern school of foot-
ball "strategy. Murray, a T-for-
mation man, has adQpted the sys-
tem of employing separate units
on offense and defense. -‘

He tempers his use’ ofthat sys-
tem, however, according to the
manpower available.

With a fair-‘sized group of
speedy’ gridders on hand, Murray
manages, nevertheless, to worry
his opponents with a wide open
offensive style. He is a fervent
addict of the forward pass and
ﬂanker plays. _ ,

The player who ﬁeld-generals
Murray’s T is Bill Hickey, a 6’ 1”,
195—pound quarterback. Hickey
gave plenty of trouble to Iowa and
could dish out lots of the same to
the Panthers on Saturday.‘

Money troubles begin and end
in the mail—box for veterans in
the student body. For most vets,
the recently imposed ﬁnancial
strain won't be lifted ’til Nov. 1,
according to J. Edward Ricart,
veteran’s advisor in the dean of
men’s office.

Hardest hit by the delay in
mailing out checks this term are
students who did not attend sum-
mer school. There is only a slight

possibility that subsistence for the
first 19 days of school in Septem-
ber will come through before the
deadline sighted by Mr. Ricart.
Those who attended classes dur-
ing the summer are not in the
class of the poverty stricken.
Checks reached those students Oct.
1, according to the veteran’s ad-
visor. ’
