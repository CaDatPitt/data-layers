NOT GUILTY

Friday, January 27, 1984

Atiyeh, Puzzuoli acquitted of charges

By John Gambescia
The Pitt News

Pitt football player Dennis Atiyeh and
former football star Dave Puzzuoli have
been acquitted of all charges stemming from
a brawl with Pittsburgh Police last
February.

A seven-man, five-woman jury returned
its verdict Wednesday afternoon after
deliberating for 90 minutes.

The ruling brought both defendants to
their feet.

The two faced criminal charges of aggra-
vated assault. terroristic threats and resist-
ing arrest as a result of an altercation
involving eight police officers.

“After all the ruckus we've been through,"
Atiyeh said, “it feels so good to have every-
thing over with and the truth out in the open.

“Now I can go on living my life, playing
football and walking down the street with-
out people getting on my case."

Puzzuoli also expressed relief following
the verdict.

“This whole thing has been hanging over
me for almost a year now," Puzzuoli said.
“I’m glad people can now see what really
happened.

“There are always two sides to every story,
and until now, everybody only had heard
one side.”

Atiyeh, 20, a junior at Pitt and a nose
guard for the Panther football team, and
Puzzuoli, 24, currently a defensive lineman
for the Cleveland Browns, encountered
police at approximately l a.m. on Feb. 20 at
the bottom of the steps leading to the Forbes
Avenue entrance to the Towers dormitories.

Puzzuoli suffered a fractured wrist, a frac-
tured fourth cervical vertibra and deep cuts
and dog bites. and several police officers
were injured in the fight which began when
police attempted to arrest the two for disor-
derly conduct.

Police contended that in resisting arrest.
Puzzuoli attacked the officers, at one point
tossing Officer DeVelma Coleman into the
air. The defense argued that the police, not

The police would react no differently
should another incident involving Pitt ath-
letes occur in the near future, according to a
police official.

Lt. Thomas Joyce of Pittsburgh Police
Station No. 4 in Oakland said that disputes
like the one with football players Dave Puz-
zuoli and Dennis Atiyeh are relatively
commonplace.

“It has happened before, and it will
happen again,” Joyce said. “We would do
the same thing."

The Oakland station arrests 15 to 20 dis-
orderly college students who are under the
influence of alcohol on any given weekend
night, Joyce said.

“The majority of the kids are good," he
said. “But when they‘ve had a few drinks,
they act differently. We go out there, settle
them down and ask their buddies to take
them home.

“Certain kids are going to get out of order,
but they will graduate like their mothers and

fathers expect them to.”

Although the incident was not considered
unusual, opinions vary on the proceedings
that followed.

“Obviously, I‘m pleased that the course of
justice has been observed," athletic director
Edward Bozik said in defense of Atiyeh and
Puzzuoli. “It proves that ourjudicial system
operates in the right manner.”

Bozik originally planned to discipline the
players, but he is now glad that he didn‘t
since they have been proven not guilty.

“That’s exactly why we don’t pass preju-

dice on anything. We haven’t applied any
sanctions on the players. Back when it
occurred, Coach Fazio was thinking of disci-
plining both players, but he wanted to wait
until the case was ajudicated.

“I am pleased with what the jury found."

Joyce wasn‘t as pleased; his fellow officers
were the ones reputed by the non-guilty
verdict.

“These kids were out of order,” Joyce
said. “They were definitely guilty. They’re
lucky to get out, but there’s no frustration or
animosity.”

Major gains approval

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

A proposal to establish a film stu-
dies major was unanimously
approved yesterday at the College of
Arts and Sciences Council (CASC)
meeting.

The new Bachelor of Arts degree,
which would be offered in CAS, was
described by CAS dean lrwin Schul-
man as the “next stage of maturity”
in the evolution of the film studies
program. .

Director of Pitt's film studies pro-
gram Dr. Lucy Fischer said that the
planned degree would be unique to
this geographic area. Neither
Carnegie-Mellon University nor
Duquesne University offers even
certificationlin the field, and the
nearest school which does have a
degree program is Point Park Col-
lege. The major at Point Park, how-
ever, is exclusively production
oriented and, unlike the course
offerings in Pitt’s current program,
places little emphasis on critical stu-
dies, Fischer said.

The new major would draw from
existing faculty and curriculum. The
course structure would be consistent
with the other CAS degree pro-
grams, according to Fischer. The
result would be a codified major,

 

which Fischer said “already exists,
but in a very cumbersome manner."

The proposal does not require
additional funding.

Fischer said people from other
universities with well-established
film studies departments have long
been impressed with what Pitt has to
offer.

“The establishment of a BA. in
film studies at Pitt will more prop-
erly represent what we‘re really
doing here," she said.

The transfer rate for students pre-
viously enrolled in Pitt's film studies
program has shown that self-
designed majors are not satisfied.

“I personally know of students
who, in the past, have transferred
from Pitt because we don’t have a
major, and they were afraid if they
tried to put something together in
the self-designed major, it wouldn’t
have credibility," Fischer said.

The proposal now goes before the

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Coun-
cil for a vote.

Mr. Showmanship

President Reagan’s State of the Union address Wednesday
night began with the assertion that “America is much
improved, and there is good reason to believe that improve-
ment will continue.” In a highly patriotic speech ﬁlled with
more showmanship than substance, Reagan went on to credit
his administration with improving virtually every aspect of life
in America. A ~

What the Reagan administration actually deserves credit for,
however, are a number of things that the president conve-
niently forgot to mention — huge increases in military spend-
ing, severe cuts in student aid programs and a series of
dismantled or gutted programs that were intended to provide
badly-needed social services for disadvantaged Americans.

As House Speaker Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill said Wednes-
day, this is an administration that “talks about cuts in Medicare
while proposing huge increases in the defense budget; a presi-
dent that talks about justice for women and minorities while his
Civil Rights Commission threatens to turn its back on decades
of progress; an administration that acknowledges that our

' children are the key to our future but abandons its leadership

role on education, child nutrition» and health."

O’Neill’s rebuttal concluded that “in case after case, we find
this administration's policies unfair to working men and
women, to the elderly, to oiir_ghildren'.'

Perhaps life in the United States has indeed improved during
Reagan’s three years in office -7 for those who are affluent,
white, male and Republican. But the grim story of America's
homeless, as reported in the current issue of Newsweek, offers
just one example of the true state of our union in I984.

Ronald Reagan may be an excellent actor and a smooth
talker, but there is no adequate way to smooth over the tragic
results of his domestic policies on working-class and poor
Americans.

Closing for Good

Governor Thornburgh is pushing hard to dismantle the pre-

sent state store system of liquor sales. His efforts follow nearly
10 years of failed attempts by other politicians to eliminate the

state-operated- liquor stores.

The state stores are operated in conjunction with the Penn-
sylvania Liquor Control Board. Liquor companies that wish to
gain access to the lucrative Pennsylvania market must first
recieve authorization from the board for each particular item
they hope to sell.

The opportunity for abuses of power in the Pennsylvania
Liquor Control Board and state store system are overwhelm-
ing, and on more than one occasion, evidence of inpropriety
has been exposed, such as a case involving payoffs to board and
state store officials by a liquor company that wanted to intro-
duce a new drink to Pennsylvania.

P Pennsylvania's state store system is known nationally,
though more so in the Northeast, for its overpriced and limited
selection of all types of liquor, especially better wines. Many

wine importers refuse to approach the Pennsylvania market.

because of the high ﬁnancial and bureaucratic barriers placed
in their path by the Liquor Control Board.

The state store system has never provided efficient service for
the citizens of the state. Liquor in the stores is more expensive
than in most other states, and the stores are not distributed by
the demand of an area but by the population and economi
levels of the neighborhood. ’

«The majority of support for the state store system comes
from the government employees who are afraid of losing their
secure and well-paying civil service jobs. They have tried to
scare the public with the old threat that a free-market system
would be more expensive. This seems completely unfounded —
if not outright “contradictory — as most liquors are already
more expensive in Pennsylvania. We believe the move to abol-
ish the state store system is long overdue and would be to the

Letters To The Editor

Visiting prof calls for revolution"

I appreciate the coverage (Piit
News, Jan. 23) given to the forum
sponsored by Socialist Action on
“Socialism and Revolution in Latin
America," at which Professor Claes
Brundenius and I gave presenta-
tions. At the same time, I would like
to comment on one of several inac-
curacies that crept into the article.

I am quoted as saying that lit
Latin America, “organization is
most important at this time. Change
must wait until the time is right.” In
fact, it is my belief that the time for
revolutionary change in Latin
America, carried out by the workers

and peasantsof that continent, is
“riper" now than ever before. The
point that I was making is that they
must organize themselves to carry
out the change now.

Also, I would like to comment on
the headline given to the article:
“US. may drive Nicaragua closer to
Soviets, professors say.” I believe
that the popular government of

Nicaragua has a perfect right to seek ’

support from other countries. In
fact, I think that the Soviet Union is
notgiving enough assistance. Only
20 percent of all aid to Nicaragua is
coming from Eastern European
countries.

I hope that all who favor the
socialist and democratic transfor-
mations of the Nicaraguan revolu-
tion will increase their support to
that country, even in the face of the
increased threats by the U.S.
government.

From Where

I Stand/ Tim Hunter

Solution

One of the major concerns of
today is increasing world population
and the lack of enough food to feed
that population.

There have been several govern-
mental plans implemented to end
the problems of a 3 percent growth
rate and lack of food. China only
allows a certain number of children
per family, and other nations supply
birth control devices to their citi-
zens. This may cure the overpopula-
tion, but it doesn‘t cure the lack of
food.

I have a proposal in mind that will
end this problem of overpopulation
and at the same time provide enough
resources so the hungry can grow
their own food.

My proposal is very simple. First,
the governments of the world should
provide a simple, convenient and
free means for people to have abor-
tions. This is a sure way to keep the
population under control.

We still must provide the hungry
world with resources, such as fertil-
izer, so that it can grow food to feed

‘ itself, and we can't deplete our
already scarce resources. I'm sure
several of you have already figured
out my answer to this problem. We
can create an abundance of fertilizer
from the abortions.

The next question, of course, is
where can we find such an abortion
device that will be convenient, sim-
ple and free?

Everyone has seen the electric
hand dryers in public bathrooms. If
the process were reversed, so that
instead of forcing out hot air, the
machines drew in air, we could have
an effective, low-cost abortion

device. I

to world

The device could be set up in pri-
vate homes or public bathrooms,
depending on the wealth of the
country. Of course, it would have to
be lower on the bathroom walls than
the hand dryers to avoid confusion.
Maybe we could paint symbols on
them — hands on the hand dryers
and little feet on the abortion device.

To make sure that the fetus is
killed, some injections of a saline
solution will be necessary after the
sucking process has finished. We
wouldn't want any of those
unwanted critters developing on us.

Once the fetuses have been
aborted, they could be sent to the
local fertilizer company. It is under-
stood that the fetuses could not be
used for all of our fertilizer. We
would have to crush them up and
mix them with other types of organic
matter.

Crushing them will also avoid
confusion among future archaeolo-
gists. Just think of the confusion
they‘d have if they dug up those little
bones. Those archaeologists would
think we were pretty short, at least
som_e of us.

The bones would surelyadd prob-
lems to future evolutionary theories.
The scientists would probably hypo-
thesize that this tiny race must have
fought“all kinds of glorious battles,
which it kept losing. Future histori-
ans would probably wonder why the
larger people killed the tiny people
all the time. We wouldn‘t want to
confuse the people of the future; so
we'd better crush the bones.

Some may feel that my idea is
somewhat‘ similar to Jonathan
Swift‘s “Modest Proposal." He

wanted to use “plump" babies as a

hunger

“nourishing, delicious and whole-
some food." He felt that the poor
mothers of Ireland could buy food
with the money they received from
the butchers. Swift was sure that any
butcher worth his salt would pay top
price for a plump baby.

Swift‘s proposal is great as long as
food is readily available for pur-
chase. My idea, using abortions as
fertilizer, creates an abundance of
food for everyone.

I don't foresee any major protests
to my proposal except from those
sillv people who actually think the
fetus is a human being and abortion
should be considered murder. These
people, such as John Noonan, argue
that “conception is the decisive
moment of humanization -— for it is
then that the new being receives the
genetic code of its parents.“

Our great argument against that
is, “A pile of building materials is

very different from a house." Boy, In)

think that's clever.

There is also the religious group. 

that believes in Cicero's “natural law
theory." The group believes we are
interfering with nature. Well, I think
it's perfectly natural for a girl to do
anything she wants with her body.

Maybe I could drop the word
“abortion" from the name of -?’.my
device for the words “pro choice?’ I
know they“mean exactly the same
thing. ‘ I

Pro-lifers support Reagan’s plan

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

Ronald Reagan represents an

alternative to pro-choice Demo-.

crats, according to many groups that
support the right to life of the
unborn.

“His address was more than polit-
ical rhetoric...it shows continuing
support," Business Manager of Pitt
Students for Life (PSL) John Van
Horn said. “What he [Reagan] said
shows he is committed to stopping
the problem of abortion.“

Reagan told Americans last Wed-
nesday night that during the first
three years of his administration,
bipartisan efforts have stressed the
legal protection of the unborn. “I
know the issue is very controver-
sial,"- Reagan said, “but unless and
until it can be proven that an unborn
child ‘is not a living human being,
can’ we justify assuming without
proof that it isn't?"

Van Horn said that he is in a
dilemma because he is a Democrat
while Reagan, a Republican, “seems
to [be the only one] seeking a
solution.

“Reagan is the only pro-life candi-
date," PSL president Rebecca Mar-
shall said.

Last week, Pitt students were
among the thousands who marched
on Washington, D.C., in an anti-
abortion rally.

Nine members of PSL demon-
strated with 65.000 De_ople on Mon-
day, Jan. 23, the anniversary of the
Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.

Members of the National Organi-
zation of Women (NOW) picketed
outside the Allegheny County
Republican Headquarters in down-
town Pittsburgh.

Students for Life members cau-
cused with about 30 other pro-life
Pennsylvania college students, met
with pro-life supporter U.S. House
Rep. Bill Coyne (D-l4th district)
and marched with the crowd from
the White House to the steps of the
Supreme Court.

Officials of the National Right to
Life Committee, a nationwide anti-
abortion group, called for President
Reagan‘s re-election.

In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled
in Roe v. Wade that a woman's right
to abortion is guaranteed by the
Constitution. In June of I983, when
the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe
v. Wade, the Reagan-appointed jus

sionals. (No surprise

tice, Sandra Day O'Connor, wrote
the dissenting opinion. Under the
Reagan-backed Hyde Amendment,
however, 38 states have decided
against Medicaid abortions under
federal employees‘ medical
insurance.

“Pro-life is not anti-woman. The
fetus is not more important than the
mother. But you don't want to be
paying for something you believe is
murder. Maybe if you cut off the
money, you will make people think
twice about what they are doing,“
Marshall said.

NOW members have denounced
Reagan’s stand on abortion and his
effect on women’s lives. They are
calling for Reagan’s defeat.

“Through his budgets, policies,
appointments and regulatory
proposals, Ronald Reagan has sys-
tematically attacked the quality of
life for millions of American women
and children,” NOW’s Reproductive
and Health Advisory Committee
chair and Director of the Allegheny
Women's Center Jeanne K. C. Clark
said. v

Board
requests

buses

By Colette Ferrls
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
endorsed a recommendation that an
additional campus bus be placed in
service beginning Fall Term, I984,
at last night's meeting.

Board members John Geyer and
Pamela Hart recommended that
another bus be added to the present
route. The" recommendation is
aimed at preventing overcrowding
problems which might result when
200 additional passengers from the
Fraternity Housing Project, cur-
rently under construction, begin
using the service.

The board thinks that an addi-
tional bus would eliminate any
inconvenience when the housing is
completed next fall. ,

The board will now take the re-
commendation to both the Panhel
office and the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil for their endorsement. The prop-
osal would then have to be presented
to Sargeant George Lancaster of the:
parking division of the campus
police. He would then further the
idea to the proper administrators.

In other business, the board voted
to suspend the bylaws of the Student
Assembly in order to extend the
assembly’s deadline an additional
two weeks to better prepare and
organize the next meeting.

Board member Jeff Mallinger,
chairman of the assembly,
announced that the nine recognized
student organizations of the assem-
bly and the Pitt Program Council
will meet Monday to discuss the
upcoming agenda and other perti-
nent matters.

The board accepted the Alloca-
tions Committee's recommendation
for $5,760 in funds for the Greek
Week formal to be held at the Pitts-
burgh Hilton on March 24.

The board also approved a
request by the IFC for $l,l47 to be
used to attend the annual North East
Conference to be held in Philadel-
phia. 1

’Ziggy Stardust: The Movie’

r———Ashes to Ashes: Monoton Pom Mars--1

By FRANK DiGIACOMO

All outward appearances suggest
that Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From
Mars: The Movie would be an excellent

S opportunity for theater—goers to see

David Bowie, rock's major futuristic
force, in perhaps his most famous
past tense. Wrong.

Although directed by D.A. Penne-
baker, who did adequate jobs with
Monterey Pop and Bob Dylan in Don't
Look Back, Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders
From Mars is a very unfunny comedy
of errors that looks like it was filmed
by a bunch of home-movie makers
instead of an experienced
cinematographer.

The film captures Bowie and the
Spiders at the Hammersmith Odeon
on the last show of their 1975 Alad-
din Sane tour (and supposedly, as
Bowie will falsely announce, the last
show he will ever do). The movie
opens with Bowie’s ex-wife, Angie,
wading through the crowd outside
and backstage where her husband is
being made up for the night's show.
However, instead of featuring a
revealing conversation between the
two, the resulting dialogue is a ridicu-
lous exchange of pleasantries.

The only information conveyed by
this and any of the remaining back-
stage scenes is that the Bowie of that
period — an ashen, skeletal androgyn
with nervous eyes hidden in grease-
paint — has little in common with
today's glossier, peroxide-and-

I

suspenders version. The suggestion
is that perhaps Ziggy Stardust was
created more out of fear than out of
genius - the vision of a petrified
young artist afraid to go onstage
without a mask. '

If the backstage scenes are mean-
ingless, then the concert footage is a
disaster. Pennebaker's crew does a
horrible job of filming this event. The
lens has a hard time staying on
Bowie’s face, and once that's accomp-
lished, the frame shakes as if the
cameraman were being jostled by the
crowd.

In addition, there are some very
unexplainable zoom shots —- one to
Bowie’s hip and another to his derrier
— that suggest Pennebaker picked
his camera crew from passersby on
the streets of London. This, com-
bined with generally grainy film qual-
ity and a lack of focused shots, makes
Ziggy Stardust very difficult to watch
for very long.

While this was the last perfor-
mance of the Stardust character and
the famed Spiders From Mars, the
question remains of whether this was
one of the group's more stellar per-
formances. One aspect of Bowie’s
concert performances that has
remained constant is that it is more of
a theatrical event than a rock-n-roll
free-for-all. Take away all of the
makeup and mime routines (he per-
forms one during the latter half of
the film), and there's not much spon-
taneity present.

  
   

1

In addition, the concert flaunts an
outdated overuse of the guitar solo
for crowd response. Mick Ronson,
besides looking like a constipated
Suzi Quatro, is responsible for some
terribly long-winded solos (most evi-
dent on ”Width Of A Circle”).

As if that weren't enough, the
crowning disappointment of the film
is that much of the footage, which
has been billed as ”never before seen"
was previously aired on late-night
television several years ago. This eli-

from theater-goers once they real-
ized this was the case.

At best, Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders
From Mars is an amusing time capsule

that blurrily captures one of rock's

most important influences during
one of his most influential periods.
Unfortunately, the third-rate pro-
duction of this film and some of its
anachronisms do not do David Bowie
justice.

"THE SCOOP” AND "BEHIND THE
SCREEN"

By Agatha Christie et. al.
Bessie/Harper 8:“ Row

The Detection Club, a society of
writers working in the mystery
genre, was formed in the early 1930s
in London. The Scoop and Behind the
Screen were group efforts, each chap-
ter of the works written by a differ-
ent member of the society.

"Originally, the stories were broad-

cast in weekly installments over the
radio. For the first time, these
recently re-discovered mystery tales
appear in print.

The most interesting aspect of the
publication is the wealth of talent
that participated in the game —— well-
known (and not-so-well-known)

SIGNS OF LIFE
By Alfred Appel, Ir.
Alfred Knopf

It may frequently be true that a A

picture is worth a thousand words.
But that may be so only because pic-
tures give us not a document of life,
but a vision and version of life, a
channeling of everyday reality
through a social mythology. Even the
most commonplace photo reveals a
whole history, an entire sweep of cul-
tural value.

In Signs of Life, a quasi-coffeetable
book of pictures and commentary,
literature professor Alfred Appel
ranges over American photos from
the '20s to the present to pinpoint
some of the hopes, defeats, contradic-
tions and tensions in the fabric of
American everyday life. His base
point is the optimistic early years of
America's involvement in World War
II, where picture upon picture gloried
in the vibrance of unfurled American
flags and where Life magazine delayed
its first picture of dead (319 for three

- years (and then only showed them in

a picture where the maggots covering
the bodies had been airbrushed out).
Appel suggests that such a moment
of the clarity of commitment could

ionly be transient, doomed to quick

reversal and overthrow. Later photo-
graphs capture a bleakness that
undercuts the American spirit and
renders it ambiguous; symptomatic is
a famous 1962 photo by that macabre
photographer, Diane Arbus, of a
young boy clutching a toy hand gre-
nade and grimacing with all the
mania that would later lead to so
much American support for the
beginnings of the Vietnam war. For
Appel, there is no innocence in such

Berkeley, Ronald Knox and Hugh
Walpole.

The Scoop offers the more satisfac-
tory detective story, set primarily in a
newspaper office —— The Morning Star's
— and involving a "scoop” surround-
ing a murder. Geraldine Potts is the
victim; she's been seeing a fellow
behind her husband's back. Mr. Potts,
naturally, is suspected of the crime.
But then Johnson, key reporter on
the Star, acquires death in a phone

booth, apparently with the same»

weapon used on Mrs. Potts! Mr.
Denis Oliver, from the police, inves-
tigates. Romance, luck, suspense,
chance —— they blend nicely for a
satisfying conclusion.

Behind the Screen begins promisingly:
One evening,» medical -student
Wilfred Hope visits the home of Amv
Ellis, his fiancee, and her family; a
body, belonging to Paul Dudden ( a
not-too-well-liked boarder at the Ellis
home), is discovered behind a decora-

photos, just a despairing recognition
and even acceptance of the ways we
have let the images around us dictate
our choices and values.

Two of Appel’s best sections deal
with glamor photos (as in the 8-by-10
Hollywood glossy) and with the
impact of television on verbal culture.
In both cases, Appel suggests the
potentially dangerous ways in which
a lost people can all too easily turn to
media images for guidance and
strength. For example, Appel sug-
gests intriguingly that the perfection
of TV news’ style may make public
lecturing a thing of j the past as
audiences find it impossible to listen
to speakers who don't have the
finesse that teleprompters and make-
up crews contribute to the newcas-
ter's persona.

Signs of Life is a meditative book that
roams over its subjects in an unpre-
dictable way. This style simultane-
ously allows Appel to come up with
thought-provoking insights, but a lit-
tle too often, it also encourages him
to be flip, elusive or just plain pre-
cious. For example, his discussion of
the ways his mind wanderedduring
treatment for a heart attack and flit-
ted back to images given to him by the
movies of his youth becomes tire-
some and pretentious. One man's
hallucinations under medication just
seem too slim upon which to build a
whole theory of media influence.

Nonetheless, much of Appel’s book
merits attention. Appel has looked at
the photos with a sharp and percep-
tive eye, and his conclusions can help
us look differently at the whole world
around us and the many cultural
messages it sends us.

aptly-named family cook. A nosey
neighbor offers his services to Police

The whole mess is wrapped up by
the next evening as the neighbor and
the policeman discuss the crime and
results ———— after the fact. There's little
mystery or detection in the conclu-

less entertaining.

Naturally, the prose varies from

Still, "The Scoop" and ”Behind the Screen "

FOREST OF A THOUSAND
DAEMONS
D.O.Fagunwa

Random House

Billed as a ”classic African novel,"
this modern fairytale and adventure
story, infused with both the wisdom
of the Bible and ancient Nigerian
legends, is too much fun to be a
”classic.”

Translated from the Yoruba by
Wole Soyinka and illustrated with six
lively black and white woodblock
prints by Bruce Onabrakpeya, Forest of
a Thousand Daemons is exciting enough
for a child and sophisticated enough
for an adult. In the first chapter, the
”author” introduces the narrator,
Akara-Ogun, Compounder-of-
Spells. In the subsequent six chap-
ters, Akara-Ogun tells the author,
the author's friends and the reader of
the terrors he survives during his
hunts in the Forest of a Thousand
Daemons — with the forest gods.

On his first two hunting expedi-
tions to Irunmal, Akara-Ogun con-
fronts mischevious ghornmids (ugly
little demi—gods) and vicious trolls
who trick, torture and fight him to
the death. At various points, the dae-
mons turn him into a bird, chain him
up to a tree and bury him alive. How-
ever, Akara-Ogun is clever, strong
and brave. He also knows many
spells, but alone, he is no match for
the fierce assortment of daemons
that assault him. In the darkest
moments of his most desperate
plights, Akara-Ogun prays to the
Christian god to save him. In tradi-
tional fairytale fashion, God usually
responds by sending a beautiful
woman with a name like ”Helpmeet”
to rescue him, and in traditional
fairytale fashion, after she rescues
him, the angelic woman usually dies.

In order to find the secret "thing"
that will enable his king to rule
wisely, Akara-Ogun travels even
further during the second half of the
book. He goes through the forest, up
the road leading to the "Dome of
Heaven," and to the city of Mt. Lang-
bodo. On this journey, Akara-Ogun
also faces many dangers: he encoun-
ters the four-headed incarnation of
fear, Eru; the angry king of the City
of Birds (where birds get their
revenge on hunters), Ostrich and the
mucus-drinking personifications of
filth, Egbin. However, the most
important part of this journey is the
wisdom Akara-Ogun gains from his
visit with the sage, Iragbeje.

Iragbeje uses parables and aphor-
isms to illustrate to Akara-Ogun the
way for amodern Africanmtan to live

\ The

a good life. He instructs Akara-Ogun ’
in everything from the details of
proper child—rearing to the correct
attitude one ought to assume before
God.

Like this advice, the translation's
language often resembles biblical
style but always maintains a Yoruba
flavor. Though the novel's allegories
are explicitly directed at Yoruba
youth, their significance is universal.

CATHEDRAL
By Raymond Carver
Alfred A. Knopf

Raymond Carver's short stories
differ from the traditional beginningl
middle/end variety. They're not plot-
ted at length; instead, Carver lifts
people and their situations from ”real

» life." Reading Cathedral, his latest col-

lection, is something like eavesdrop-
ping on the neighbors — entering
after the beginning and leaving
before the finish.

In deceptively straightforward
conversational prose, Carver aims at
the heart of his matters. Carelessly
careful and unerringly precise lan-
guage outlines Carver's characters
and slices of their lives.

Strangers meet and wonder, aloud
and silently, in "The Train," one of
the best stories in the set. A gruff
baker finds himself stuck with a cake
inscribed for a child who has just been
killed in ”A Small, Good Thing.” ”The
Bridle” symbolizes the given-up
dreams of a Minnesota man. ”Where
I'm Calling From" is an alcohol
drying—out clinic. A father decides to
forego a reunion with his son —— ”The
Compartment." A blind man, holding
onto the hand of a sighted man,
draws a cathedral in the title piece.
dozen stories comprising
Cathedral waste no words. Carver's
moments are brief and fragile, carried
neatly on his streamlined prose.

MAKING PEACE WITH YOUR
PARENTS

By Harold I-I. Bloomfield, M.D. with
Leonard I-"elder, Ph. D.

Random House

Eminent psychiatrist and best-
selling author Dr. Harold Bloomfield
describes how to come to grips suc-
cessfully with the most fundamental
and perhaps difficult relationship of
our lives in Making Peace With Your Par-
ents. No matter what age we are, he
points out, and whether or not our
parents are alive, we must resolve the
issues in our lives that are a result of
our relationship with our parents.
We pay a terrible price in the form of
emotional wounds and even physical
illness for having unfinished business
with our parents, he says.

continued from page ten

In his new book, the Yale-trained
psychiatrist shows us that under-
neath any anger and resentment, we
each have a deep desire to love and be
loved by our parents. Drawing upon
his extensive practice and research in
the field as well as his moving per-
sonal experience of making peace
with his parents, Dr. Bloomfield
helps us deal constructively with the
problem in families of both love and
anger.

”You don't have to resist or comply
with parental expectations,” writes
Dr. Bloomfield, ”any more than they
have to resist or comply with yours....
The paradox is that if you want the
relationship to change and improve,
you need to accept your parents
exactly as they are.”

This extremely helpful, specific
and compassionate book contains
relevant case studies and easy-to-
understand exercises. Topics include
how to go beyond resentment to for-
giveness, how to avoid the approval
trap, how to unravel parental mes-
sages of sex and love and how to
improve communications within the
family. Dr. Bloomfield also covers
how to diffuse guilt, how to make
family visits satisfying, how to deal
with sick or aging parents and how to
cope with the death of a parent. Spe-
cial attention is paid to dealing effec-
tively with martyrs, dictators and
other difficult parents.

”To improve your relationship,

with your real-life parents," Dr.
Bloomfield emphasizes, ”you must
first make peace with your inner par-
ent —— the internalized messages,
feelings and conflicts you carry
within.” This practical book teaches
us how to ”become our own best par-
ent” and become more nurturing not
only to ourselves but to our children.
Readers are guided to the under-
standing that the mentor, coach and
guide that they may have been look-
ing for elsewhere is in fact insic
them.

Harold H. Bloomfield, M.D. and
Leonard Felder, Ph.D., were both
graduates of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Dr. Leo Buscaglia has called
this book ”compassionate, well-
written and of great value to many."

FURY ON EARTH: A BIOGRAPHY
OF WILHELM REICH

By Myron Sharaf

St. Martin's Press

Wilhelm Reich was the wild man of
phychoanalysis. After starting as a
fairly classical psychoanalyst in
Freud's Vienna and then becoming
one of the most important figures in
the early move to find a meeting-
ground between psychoanalysis and
Marxist sociology, Reich turned into
a strange case — a scientist-become-
mystic who claimed to find in air-
waves a vital life energy and who
believed in flying saucers as bringers
of a new order of being. Reich talked
in cosmic terms way before the '60s
ever began; anticipating that decade's
call for new forms of sexuality, he
even constructed ”Orgone” boxes,
little compartments in which he
argued people would soak up the cos-
mic force of the universe and increase
their life potentials. Reich's work is a
blend of the deadly serious (he was
one of the earliest psychoanalysts to
theorize a connection between men-
tal disorder and body comportment)
and the absolutely fanciful. For many

people, his work has become a symbol .

of those endeavors that seek to go
beyond the usual bounds and com-

partmentalizations that ”normal"'

society decrees for its members.

THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY
By Henry James
Modern Library

The Portrait of a Lady, appearing first
in 1881, offers the story of Isabel
Archer, a graceful and lively young
woman who visits Europe after her
father's death. Strong-willed and
intelligent, Isabel enjoys the atten-
tions of several suitors but makes an
unfortunate choice, marrying
bounder Gilbert Osmond. She
resigns herself to the unpleasant
situation and in that, finds her ulti-
mate triumph.

James’ penchant for wordiness
always provides a challenge; The Por-
trait of a Lady is a careful, well—crafted
novel. Among James’ best early
works, it explores one of the author's

isla fine introduction to this complex
life. Sharaf was a student and
admirer of Reich's, but he is readily
able to admit those moments when
he feels Reich was psychotic and gave
in to the most incredible of delusions
(for example, his belief that he had
tapped into the energy source of
weather and could make it rain at
will). Impressively, Sharaf’s bio-
graphy is more than just a chronol-
ogy of events and facts; he
perceptively discusses the ideas as
well as the man himself and well sug-
gests the evolution of Reich's philo-
sophy from classical to bizarre. Most
touching are the final pages of the
book where he discusses the FDA’s
prosecution of Reich as a charlatan
and a quack — a prosecution that
quickly and obviously turned into a
persecution and ended up with Reich
dead of a heart attack in the prison to
which he had been sent for his
research on Orgonic Energy. Sharaf
doesn't defend Reich's later work;
rather, he sees the tragedy as residing
in the destruction of an overall
career. In Sharaf’s analysis, Reich
emerges as quite often a maniac, but
also, as frequently, as an important
thinker, one whose blend of art,
imagination and science echoes ear-
lier thinkers (like Dostoevsky and

favorite themes —— that of the dis-
placed American in Europe and the
ensuing cultural clash.

The Portrait of a Lady, in part‘, heralds
the return of the Modern Library.
From classics to modems and since
1917, the Modern Library has pro-
vided attractively bound reprints of
”more than 750 of the world's grea-
test works of literature, history, phi-
losophy, phychology, religion,
biography and belles lettres."

There's nothing like the feel of a
solidly—bound book; they're easier to
read (a luxury that any paperback
reader can appreciate). The Modern
Library's wide selection of reasonably
priced titles makes its return very
good news.

RICHARD SATER

others that Sharaf cites) and antici-
pates later ones (like the radical Brit-
ish therapist, R.D. Laing).

Despite a following in the margina-
lia of psychoanalysis, Reich is only
slowly becoming a figure to receive
serious discussion. Literally, much of
his thought has been unavailable
since the late '50s when the FDA
managed to get a court order to have
his major writings burned and all
available copies removed from circu-
lation. Sharaf was able to consult
texts buried away in libraries, private
collections and archives, and he pres-
ents a comprehensive look at Reich's
world. The book is fascinating and
well worth the attention of anyone
intrigued by the eccentric figures
who dot our intellectual history.

INDELIBLE SHADOWS g
By Anette Insdorf

The slaughter of the Jews in Ger-
many during World War II, referred
to now as the Holocaust, has been
variously represented on film since
the 19409. The movies have

. approach,e,d.,;.t,he..,subject, ..a.s,;..~.co.med.y,  ..

personal documentary, and over-
blown or understated drama.

”Eilmmakers and film critics con-
fronting the Holocaust face a basic
task — finding an appropriate lan--
guage for that which is mute or defies
visualization,” Annette Insdorf
explains as an introduction to Film and
the Holocaust, a thorough study of its
subject.

Liberally illustrated with stills and
fully documented, Insdorf’s work
provides insightful, opinionated dis-
section of that body of film which
reflects indirectly or actually depicts
the time period. The subject, for all its
grotesqueness, fascinates; filmmak-
ers, therefore, shoulder heavy
responsibility, given the persuasive
nature of the movies. Is it possible to
convey a true sense of the Holocaust
via cinema?

Insdorf divides the approaches the-
matically, discussing the language of
film as a descriptive medium, the
approaches to story—telling, the on-
film responses to the Nazi reign, and
documentary as a personal statement
— films ”made by survivors.”

The films discussed are generally
available —— as diverse as Mephisto, The
Last Metro, The Sorrow and the Pity and
The Boys From Brazil. Film and the Holo-
caust offers a thoughtful and provoca-
tive examination of a unique
phenomenon in the movie business:
the continual influence of a particu-
larly atrocious decade of history.

CYNDI LA UPER

ii /

SOME GIRLS HAVE ALL
THE FUN, Y’KNOW?

The first thing you gotta know
about Cyndi Lauper is that she talks
funny; I mean, she doesn't "talk," she
"tawwks," you know? (Oh, yeah, and
she says "y'know" a lot.) She sounds
like Betty Boop if Betty had been born
in the BrooklynIQueens area (Cyndi
is from Brooklyn, but her actual birth
took place at Boulevard Hospital in
Queens). She pronounces things the
way she wants to, twisting them
around or making up new ones
altogether.

Robert Hazard (a Philadelphia-

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

based singer/songwriter who
authored the incredible "Girls Just
Want to Have Fun") becomes ”Raw—
bot Heyzerd" and "subsequently"
comes out "subsequentially." Now,
all of this may not mean a whole lot to
you, but if you're gonna bother (boi-
tha?) to read any further, then (den?)
you oughta get into the right frame
of mind and start reading things her
way, y'know? So, put a wad of the
super bubble variety in yer mouth
("chops/' as Cyndi calls ’em), jangle
15 bracelets at once (Cyndi’s fond of

jewelry), laugh a lot and pretend like
you're a character from a '30s mob-
ster movie, and you won't have a
problem understanding her at all.
Cyndi Lauper, rock's newest sensa-
tion, arrives just in time for happy
hour in the bar located in the base-
ment of the University Inn. Dressed
in an antique beaded sweater, Levis
and heavy, black military boots with
pearl ropes wrapped around the
ankles, she causes a commotion on
sight. The fact that she has on
enough jewelry to'sink a tanker and

her bright orange-colored hair is
sticking out everywhere and one side
has a greenish colored braid in it could
have something to do with all the
stares she's catching, too.

But Cyndi doesn't care, in fact, she
seems used to an audience; whether
they're adoring fans or traveling bus-
inessmen who view her as a freak
doesn't seem to make much of a dif-
ference. After a few false starts, she
finally orders a creme de cacao
(”cream of coco" is actually the way
she pronounces it) before the ram-

bling starts. No, no, not the drug-
induced rambling that comes from
someone who has so much to say that
she loses her train of thought mid-
sentence. Cyndi will start out with
the intention of answering one, spe-
cific question and end up telling you
three stories and 10 jokes and per-
forming an imitation of an old movie
star before she remembers what the
original question was. But it's quite
alright, ’cos she's funny as hell and
she cracks you up every five minutes.

Before striking out on her own,
Cyndi was in a band called Blue
Angel, a band that amassed a great
deal of critical success, but in the
midst of the music industry's reces-
sion, failed to produce the necessary
cash flow to sustain them. They
released a single album in 1980 before
all the pressure got to them and they
slowly dissolved. This is the one thing
Cyndi doesn't make jokes about —— it's
still too painful and recent a memory.

“We were a rockabilly band; we did
what I call ‘premature rockabilly’ ’cos
it was before the Stray Cats and all
that. But people labelled us and
tagged us as a '50s’ band, and they
really didn't understand what the hell

  
   

we were doing anyway," Cyndi says
quietly.

"Unfortunately for Blue Angel, we
stuck it through a record company
that didn't understand what we were
doing, a manager who didn't under-
stand what he was doing,
and...uh...we just couldn't fight eve-
rybody...” she says, faltering. "After a
while, the music and the magic we
had onstage —— and we did! We had a
raw energy and a lot of happiness and
joy -—- just disappeared.”

But, never one to dwell on the dark
side of circumstance, Cyndi quickly
jumps into a different topic. "With
the demise of Blue Angel, I took these
odd jobs. One of these was, uh, work-
ing —— get ready for this! —t~ as a hos-
tess in a Japanese piano bar in New
York, and I would sing in Japanese
and wait on tables!

”But, one of the first gigs I got
doing that was not, uh, well, see,” she
says, waning slightly, before con-
tinuing, “the second place was a fam-
ily place, but the first one wasn't. It
was, like, dancing with the custo-
mers, dark lighting and couches,
y’know?

“Anyway,” she says, somehow
managing to make sense and confuse

"7" you at the same time, "the year

before I was on a TV show in Europe
with Blue Angel, and Hall & Oates
and the B-52's were on it, too. Hall &
Oates sang this really great song. So
then, I'm working at the piano bar,

As you may have noticed, Cyndi is a nice girl and, of course, a talent
to be reckoned with. But sheldoes ramble, and her thoughts don't
always lend themselves to paragraph form. Therefore, it's necessary
to print the following Cyndi Lauper quotations by themselves, since
they didn't seem to fit in anywhere else.

‘‘In school, I was always told ‘Oh, you're such an actress!’ by the
nuns. Me and the nuns —- ha! — we got along great! Anyway, I got
thrown out ’cos I really used to break the nuns‘ chops! I was an
irritant, I guess, even at the age of nine; like, I asked [or, as Cyndi
says, “axed"] them if they went swimming, and they said, ‘Yes,’ and I
said, ‘You wear bathing suits?’ and they said, ‘Yes,’ and I said, ‘You go
in the water?!‘ and they said, ‘Yes,’ and I said, ‘Don't the cardboard get
wet???’ And then of course, I asked them if they menstruated, and
they threw me out....” A

“Norton is my hero. Ya ever watch ‘The Honeymooners’? I do, I'm
into culture.”

"Of course, a lot of people wonder if I'm from England ‘cos of my
accent...or even France. But, I just tell them, ‘No, I'm from
Brooklyn....‘ "

“I do imitations; Ethel —— I do Ethel Merman, and other crazy
things. Like Julie Andrews singing ‘Stairway To Heaven’....”

“Captain Lou [Captain Lou Albano, a hefty Studio Wrestling star
who appears as Cyndi’s father in the ‘Girls Just Want To Have Fun’
video] is great. He's become my personal adviser — it's true! He
advises me on the P.E.G. principal — that stands for Politeness,
Etiquette and Grooming. Now, if anybody has these three things
down good, it's Captain Lou. And, see, he figures, and I do, too, that in
my business —- rock’n’roll -— you do a lot of business at the dinner
table, and you have to know how to talk about deep, emotional
concepts over the dinner table without spitting food, y’know?“

“The great Samoans are really well-groomed, and I think they're
really primal and new-wave looking. I think the Samoans are rock
stars.”

1 we‘

and I'm dancing -—- doingmy job, you
know -—- and I heard the same song.
All all of a sudden, it just really hit
home, and it felt horrible! It broke my
heart that here I am a singer and a
writer, and what the hell was I doing
here? And, uh, after that...."

(Here, Cyndi pulls another mood switch,
going from serious to giggly, and trips head-
first into another story altogether.)

“My picture came out in Life Maga-
zine!!!" she screams, much to the
bewilderment of the bar patrons,
who are becoming more confused by
the presence of this loud creature
with the noisy jewelry. She then pro-
ceeds to talk in depth about the photo
session and how it took place in a
beauty parlor on Lexington Avenue
owned by a woman whose dog was a
pathetic creature with only one eye.

“Well, that's that!” she laughs
uproariously (Is there any other
way?). "I didn't mean to turn the
story into a song and dance! What
was the question?”

Five anecdotes later, Cyndi men-
tions her debut solo LP, She's So Unus-
ual, which is gathering raves and
momentum even as we speak and
which is the reason why this inter-

  
   

I l”hoto“Bywl"\/Iartha Rial

view took place at all. “Girls Just
Want To Have Fun," equally as good
on vinyl as on video, is sitting pretty
at No. 31 this week with a bullet, and
if you give the album a listen, you'll
know there's plenty more where that
came from. There's an undeniable
sense of fun that permeates the
effort —— not unusual considering
Lauper’s personality —— but the lis-
tener is also left with the definite
impression that the entire LP is the
work of people who cared about the
end result.

“I found the right group of people
to be around all of a sudden -—- a man-
ager who understood and helped me,
a record company and an industry
that's more open to individuals,” she
says, getting serious again.

“I mean, a lot of people wonder
what happened to Blue Angel, and I
thought that opening with ‘Money
Changes Everything’ would kinda
answer that; maybe if\ we'd had
money...but," she shrugs. "Anyway,
I'm glad things turned out the way
they did. I got to write with a lot of
people; I got a new band; I'm really
happy -— I'm having a great time,
making fun music, and there's
growth, and I'm continuing my work.

“And I'm myself, and I can use my
own mind, which is a great thing —
y’know that commercial, ‘A mind is a

terrible thing to waste’.7” she asks,’

again dissolving into giggles. “Well,
it's true!”

Showcase, Friday, January 27, 1984”

By JONATHAN KUNKEL

DA, the current offering from the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre, is a
heart-warming theatrical experience.

Set in Dublin, Ireland, DA concerns
the memories that Charlie has for his
father, who has just died. Charlie
calls his father ”Da,” the Irish nick-
name for ”fatl

The play begins as Charlie is sifting
through Da's things, right after Da's
funeral. Charlie sees his father's
image in his mind, and this creates a
series of flashbacks.

Hugh Leonard's script provides a
good overview of what life was like
with Da by presenting the flashbacks
in a fascinating manner; these flash-
backs provide some moving moments
as well as a good amount of comic
relief.

Leonard breaks through the boun-
daries of reality by having Charlie
talk to his teenage self (who is played
by another actor). By doing this, Leo-
nard provides great insight into the
relationship that Charlie had with

Da. Leonard adds to this insight by
having Charlie talk to his father after’
his death and elicit Da's reaction to
what Charlie has said to him.

Leonard provides a taste of life in
1940's Ireland as well as fascinating
character studies -— especially Da,
who is a many-faceted man.

The strongest performance of the
evening was given by Bingo O’Mal-
ley, who again proves that he is one of
Pittsburgh's most talented actors.
His interpretation of the difficult but
lovable Da was so fully rounded and
well developed that it was hard to
believe that he was really an actor
portraying a role.

Another strong performance was
given by Iohnette Sullivan, who por-
trayed ”mother.” She not only looked
the part of a harsh Irish mother, but
she acted the part down to the last
detail. She and O’Malley comple-
mented one another nicely and made
their argument scene in the second
act one of the most moving parts in
the play.

Director Bill Royston used natural-
istic staging, which kept the action
flowing. He also had the actors going
at a pace that added fuel to the play.

Theater.

Trudy Beaudry as Mrs. Prynne and
Joe Schad as Drumm turned in fasci-
nating character portrayals that
made the play more enjoyable and
interesting to watch.

Jan Pascale’s multi-leveled set was

G.W. Rooney and Robert Stoll star in DA at the Pittsburgh Laboratory

well thought out; it provided differ-
ent acting areas that suggested the
different places of action.

DA is another evening of wonder-
ful entertainment from the Lab, and
it's suitable for the entire family.

‘The Basic Training
of Pavlo Hummel’

BY JONATHAN KUNKEL

Famous Rider's The Basic Training of
Pavlo Hummel, is a hard-hitting drama
that not only presents the realities of
the Vietnam war ‘but also follows a
street punk through the various
stages of becoming a seasoned
veteran.

The Famous Rider took a chance in
performing this play because of its
difficult nature and its large cast, but
it was a chance that was definitely
worth taking.

The Basic Training of Paula Hummel
begins with the death of its protago-
nist, Pavlo Hummel. What follows is
a series of flashbacks that shows

Hummel from basic training to his
death in a Vietnam whorehouse.

Pavlo encounters many different
types of people in his ”career” with
the army. Perhaps one of the most
interesting of these characters in
Kress, a dumb and tough undesirable
who gives Pavlo no end of grief and
harassment. Pavlo gets the last laugh,
though, when Kress has to repeat
eight weeks of basic training because
he failed a proficiency test. —

David Rabe’s intelligent script was
written as if the audience were inside
Pavlo’s mind, witnessing what he
thought as he thought it. This means
that the action isn't necessarily in
chronological order, but the way that
Rabe wrote the play makes it fairly
easy to follow.

Another clever device that Rabe
used was in the form of Ardell, a dead
soldier who accompanies Pavlo
through the memories of Pavlo’s

army experience. The use of Ardell
gave more depth and understanding
to the play and made it easier to
understand.

Fred Donatellis’ direction was
good, considering the small space and
the large cast with which he had to
work. His staging made the stage
seem less crowded than it really was.

Philip John Winters, who por-
trayed Pavlo Hummel, turned in a
powerful performance, despite the
fact that he must have had a rather
difficult time analyzing Pavlo; Pavlo
is such a difficult character to figure
out.

Tim R. Bintrim did an excellent job
portraying Kress. He provided a lot of
emotion and feeling during some of
the strongest moments of the play,
and also should be commended for
bringing forward the dumb side of
Kress. ‘

Also worth mentioning is David

Theatre will transport you from the

frigid Oakland weather to a place
where ”it’s too hot for anything to
grow.” The theater is presenting two
one-acts set in Maynard, Texas. The
plays were written by James McLure
to be performed as a complete even-
ing in the theater, though each is self-
contained and solely gripping.
Laundry and Bourbon focuses on three
small—town women approaching the
magic age of 30, and Lone Star centers
on three men of the same age. The
characters’ in the plays know each
other (Elizabeth and Amy Lee from
Laundry and Bourbon are married to Lane
Star's Roy and Cletis, respectively).
The former play V is directed by
undergraduate directing major
Kenyon Barr and features Eugenia
Miller as the steady Elizabeth, Jose-
phine Fisher playing a frazzled Hattie
and the meddling Amy Lee played by
Studio Theatre veteran Cece
Donoghue. The play is about secrets,
dreams and acceptance and ponders
the meaning of winners and losers. It
is a dark comedy, the humor coming
from the inner strength and spirit of
life found within the characters.
Lone Star is a similar play, funnier,
yet more pathetic in some ways, than
Laundry and Bourbon, a reflection of the
difference in human nature of
women and men. MFA directing stu-
dent Jim Robinson is at the helm of
this show, with the lead role of Roy
being played by Dan Barnhart (seen
last semester in The Woods), Joe Comm
(in Line last semester) as his brother
Ray and George Cherico as the perse-
cuted Cletis. The situation here is
hysterically charming with an almost

prophetic resolution that somehow
manages to tie both plays up nicely
and have you leaving the theater
fulfilled.

Come in out of the pelting ice and
have your heart warmed in the inti-
mate surroundings of Pitt's Studio
Theatre. Easy to find, it is located
right in the basement of the Cathed-
ral of Learning. Laundry and Bourbon/
Lone Star will run tonight through
Sunday and next weekend, Feb. 2-4.
Curtain time is 8 p.m.

All Studio Theatre productions are
free to undergraduates and only $1
for other students and senior citi-
zens. For reservations, call 624-6587.

(‘Day of the

Picnic’

By LINDA HENRY

The City Theatre Company was
rencently acclaimed for bringing con-
sistently good work to the public in
1983. Their first offering for 1984
proves to be no exception. The Day of
the Picnic by Russell Davis is extremely
interesting and very contemporary
and adheres to artistic director Marc
Masterson’s commitment to produce
new plays. J

In being so new, there are some
complexities in the script that are not
completely worked out in this pro-
duction, however, the flaws are far
outweighed by the intriguing pre-
mise, the unusual conventions with
which it is worked out and the sensi-

tive staging by director Jed Harris. .

The story takes place in a nursing
home and centers around six resi-
dents on the day of the nursing home
picnic. For various reasons (suspicion
of poisoned hot chocolate being one),
these six people stay behind and
become involved in a bizarre
sequence of events that mixes voo-
doo, mystery, strange voices and
other weird happenings that leads to
an ultimate confrontation between
two of the residents —— Betsy Full-
bright, a formermissionary to Africa,
and Julius Nkumbi, an old misplaced
witch doctor. It is their relationship
that is the driving force of the play.

Bob Johnson as Nkumbi spends
almost the entire play on stage in a
wheelchair, rarely speaking or even
moving, a difficult job for any actor.
Johnson renders a haunting charac-
ter that is both stirring and
compelling.

Ann Muffly holds her ground
opposite Nkumbi as the neither
spooked nor apologetic Betsy Full-
bright, who accepts her fate with dig-
nity and grace. A charming scene
near the end of the play between Ms.
Muffly and Allan Pinsker as East
European immigrant Dinko Tasovac
is worth the evening in the theater.
Pinsker is a stitch as Tasovac!

The exuberance of the show, how-
ever, comes from Denise Jones’ por-
trayal of Myrenna Hawthorne. She is

' funny, lovable, maternal and con-

vincingly stirred by the presence of a
culture she has lost.

The technical crew deserves its
share of the applause for this produc-
tion, which depends on numerous
special effects and a sense of depth

-‘Page :—=fB ,

   

achieved through set design in
moments where the playwright has
imposed flatness. Masterful scene
design and technical direction are by
Tony Ferrieri, with costumes by Lor-
raine Venberg and a wonderful light-
ing design by Bob Steineck.

There is even a quick image that
alludes to ”The Day After,” a subtle
but gripping moment when you real-
ize that if people don't learn to live
with each other rather than trying to
dominate one another, there will be
no more picnics. It is not depressing
or morbid, just gripping.

The Day of the Picnic runs through
Feb. 5 at the New City Theatre.

Eurythmics: Touching
All The Right Chords

TOUCH on the first side are ”Blue,"
Eu:-ythmics ”Regrets" and, especially,
RCA ”Who's That Girl," on which

Although the article on the
British invasion of the '80s in
Newsweek did not seem to have
mentioned it, both Eurythmics
and Culture Club are musical
groups, not merely androgy-
nous trend-setters.

Toarh, Eurythmics' third
album and the second U.S.
release, is a solid, intelligent LP
that leaves no doubt that the
quality of music on last year's
Sweet Dreams was not a fluke.

lndeed, Eurythmics have
overcome the ”second album"
syndrome that plagues many
groups (Boston, Flock of Sea-
gulls and ABC are past exam-
ples) after their first big seller.
As with the Sweet Dreams album,
a variety of styles and experi-
ments are present on Touch.

The album opens with the
current single, ”Here Comes
the Rain Again," featuring a
violin riff that catches the ear
and won't let go. Other winners

LEARNING TO CRAWI.
The Pretenders
Sire Records

As a comeback album, Learning
To Crawl must be considered a
worthwhile effort by the
newly-renovated Pretenders.
The deaths of two original
members in the nearly 18
months since the band's last
release had shaken the founda-
tion of one of the industry's
most promising acts. In that
sense, then, the new record is a
commendable return to form.

However, taken as the third
album—length release domi-

nated by the presence of lead
singer, songwriter and rhythm
guitarist Chrissie Hynde, Learn-
ing To Crawl suffers a bit in both

 
 

....................  E"-«]_]_'OOOOOOCC000000000OOOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOCO COOOCOOOOCOOOOOOCOOOOOO000000000OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Ann Lennox is at her most
seductive and chilling. It's a con-
tradiction, but that seems to be
what the duo is fascinated with.
In the first verse of ”Who's That
Cirl," Lennox is in anguish over
the contradictions of the lan-
guage of love: ”Cooler that ice
cream and warmer than the
sun." Then, she becomes
menacing asking: There's just
one thing I really want to know/
Who's that girl?

Side two is perhaps the more
interesting though less accessi-
ble side of the album. "The First
Cut," begins the side and is a
fast-paced song that showcases
both Lennox's vocal (and key-
board) and David Stewart's
instrumental talents. It rivals
”No Fear, No Hate, No Pain (No
Broken Heart)," for the best
song on the album. A lush back-
ground combined with intelli-
gent lyrics that are reminiscent
of Joni Mitchell's early work
makes ”No Fear, No Hate, No
Pain” a song you wish were 10

intent and effect.

Certainly, it is difficult to
assess the personal loss of gui-
tarist James Honeyman Scott
and bassist Pete Farndon (who
had left the band before his
death) with respect to Ms.
Hynde. Stylistically, however,
her new bandmates show an
ability to nearly match the per-
formance of the original lineup,
though they are a little less bril-
liant around the edges.

The locomotive rhythm of
"Middle of the Road/"’Time the
Avenger” and ”l Hurt You" are
fueled by the same bottom-
heavy feel that made numerous,
earlier Pretender songs arrest-
ing. The subtle layering of gui-
tar tracks along with the
rough-and-ready delivery of
Ms. Hynde add further fuel to
the band's fire. Furthermore,
"Show Me" is a nice romantic
ballad on the order of Pretenders
It's ”Message of Love”and ”Talk
of the Town.”

In spite of these undeniable
triumphs, however, Learning To
Crawl has its share of problems
as well. Neo-rockabilly numbers
"Watching the Clothes" and
"Thumblina" both fail in the
hands of a band more suited to
black leather than raw cowhide.
The choral ”Thin Line Between
Love and Hate" is, in fact, the
only time on this record that the
Pretenders successfully stray
from their distinctive sound.

And then there is the problem
of previously-released material,
which might not be so bad
except that this band has victim-
ized us with this before. A
Christmas song and both sides
of a single released almost a year
ago seem less than relevant
here; they seem deceitful.

minutes instead of seven min-
utes long.

Although it problably won't
be as big as Sweet Dreams simply
because there's no song that has
the pure catchiness of the title

Collectively, the music on
Learning to Crawl offers more
hope for the future of the Pre-
tenders than concern about the
present. The musical muscle
this band can flex is rarely in
doubt, though its application is
occasionally suspect. If indeed
this album represents ”learning
to crawl" for the Pretenders,
one can only be anxious for
them to get back on their feet
again.

rock the United States. Heavy
metal fans will rejoice over the
Headpins’ new album, Line of

listens to their album might
have the urge to throw their
head against a wall and let out a
loud "UUUCCHHY" The Head-
pins' new album is loud, agres-
sive garbage, saturated with
screechy vocals and numerous
guitar noises.

Unfortunately, with the
Headpins, leather is abundant
while talent is scarce. Lead sin-
ger Darby Mills screams repeti-
tive, idiotic lyrics throughout
the entire album. One of those
”meaningful" songs is entitled
”Feel it (Feel my Body)/' which
is another one of those slow,
hard, sexually-oriented rockers

- and believe me, it can become
quite nauseating listening to
this loan Iett/Janis Joplin clone
moaning her sexual fantasies
over and over again.

The Headpins are at their best
(if you could call it that) when
they combine the pop/rock
sound. "Just One More Time" is
a fairly catchy, enjoyable tune,
and it is an example of their ligh—
ter side. However, the album is
very inconsistent in style, and
the Headpins quickly switch
back to that grinding, in—need—
of—an-earplug sound.

Line of Fire lacks creativity and
offers us nothing more than
your better—than—average Pitts-
burgh rock band cranks out.
Although the album is
extremely horrible, it still might
sell, considering the resurgence
of hard rock. Actually, there are
a lot of rotten groups who are
commercially successful —— but
record sales do not insure
quality.

LISA LAVALLE
THE RHINO BROTHERS
PRESENT: THE WORLD'S
WORST RECORDS!
Various "artists"
Rhino

Has anyone seen Leonard
Pinth Carnell lately? There is an
album here that would truly
light up his trash can. The World's
Worst Records.’ is a truly tasteless
collection of some of the most
excruciatingly bad novelty
songs that federal laws permit.
There's Edith Massey’s (you
saw her in Pink Flamingos and
Polyester) nauseating version of
the Four Season's "Big Girls
Don't Cry; " "Kazooed On Klas-
sics," a really bad take-off on an
already bad "Hooked On Clas-
sics;" ”I Want My Baby Back,"
Jimmy Cross’ ode to necrophilia;
and "Paralyzed," which sounds
like a stroke victim's attempt at
singing.

If that's not enough, there's
10 other vinyl turdpiles here to
delight the friends and family.
Some of them are even kind of
fun to listen to like '’I Wanna Be
Your Dog," which is supposed
to be the Three Stooges per-
forming a song semi-
immortalized by Iggy Pop and
his Stooges (the band is called
the Seven Stooges). There's also
"Boogie Woogie Amputee," a
song with lyrics like "I'll shake
my hips and she shakes her
stumps." This brings to mind
that for the faint of stomach,
the album comes with a vinyl
sickness bag, and no doubt, it
comes to good use.

Like the liner notes say, ”Any
nerd can make boring music. It
takes true talent to make one of
the world's worst records ~ and
it takes infinite genius to listen
to 14 of them on one LP." In any
case, this album lives up to its
claims and should be just right
for the friend or family member
who's out of his mind, with a
lifetime membership.

Tonight at New York City‘s Mad-
ison Square Garden, Pitt’s junior
hurdler Roger Kingdom competes
for the most prestigious indoor track
and field award, the gold watch pre-
sented to the winners at the Wanam-
aker-Millrose Games.

For Kingdom, the task is plain ~
beat the number-one-ranked
hurdler in the world, Greg Foster.

“Roger is the only guy who can
really challenge Foster," Steve
Lewis, Kingdom’s coach said. “I
believe, and this is only my opinion,
that Roger is the most talented and
best hurdler. Foster is as talented,
it’s just that he‘s got more
experience."

Kingdom has played the under-
dog many times, and many times,
he’s played it well. He upset the

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

At the opening of this season,
line on the Panther basketball team
stepping up to contender status or
remaining a second division squad
in the Big East depended on whether
someone else could consistently
score with Clyde Vaughan.

Against Syracuse Wednesday
night, Pitt went back to the
Vaughan-only offense, and it
resulted in a 62-58 loss at the Fitz-
gerald Field House. The final score
was close due to the last-minute
rush. -

Vaughan managed to score 19
points, good enough to tie Billy
Knight for third on the Pitt all-time
scoring list. Vaughan shot 9-for-16
from the field, but the 6-4 senior was
the only threat on the court to
Syracuse.

Syracuse played a sagging 2-3
zone the entire game, putting
emphasis on covering Vaughan.
This defense dared the Pitt guards to
shoot, and the results showed it.
Nine-for-34 accuracy, or lack there
of, from the guard position included
a horrible 3-for-15 night from
George Allen. The team only shot
34.8 percent (24 of 69) for the entire
evening.

“They sat back and challenged us
to shoot,” Pitt head coach Roy
Chipman said. “We were taking
good shots...we’re lousy shooters.

“Maybe we have to recruit better
shooters.”

Another solution could have been
to attack the zone. The Panthers
were content to pass the ball around
the perimeter, praying for a small
opening inside. When the shot clock
ran down to single digits, the guards
threw up long-range jumpers, ones
that end up anywhere but at the net.

“We weren‘t making anything

~

happen," Vaughan said. “We didn’t
penetrate.” 

“We didn’t play with the same
kind of intensity,” Chipman said.
“The only kid trying to penetrate
was Joey David.

“I thought we weren‘t challenging
their big guys, and they don’t have
any shot blockers.” . I

The lack of intensity was also evi-
dent on the defensive end. Syracuse
exploited Pitt's defense, the l-3-l
half-court zone trap. The front line
of Sean Kerins, who led the Orange-
man with 17 points, Rafael Addison
and Andre Hawkins consistently hit
baseline jumpers and layups as Syra-
cuse shot I2-for-l6 in the second
half, 62.5 percent for the game.

“The defense wasn‘t as aggres-
sive,” Chipman admitted.

Much of that could have been due
to the early foul difficulties by start-
ing guards Curtis Aiken and Billy
Culbertson. Culbertson picked up
two fouls in the first minute and a
half while Aiken was put on the
bench seven minutes into the game
with three.

The foul problem took care of the
duel between Aiken and Dwayne
Washington. Washington, who
scored 10 points, was the fourth Syr-
acuse player in double figures but
also led the Orangemen with six
turnovers.

Meanwhile, Chipman believes the H

game could have taken on a different
complexion had Aiken remained in
the game. The 5-1 I freshman was
2-for-3 from the floor, both shots
coming from the top of the key.
“Curtis could have made a differ-
ence,” Chipman said. “He’s the best
perimeter shooter we have besides

Clyde. Without him, it put more A

pressure on the other kids.”

Still, there is a need for someone
on the Panther roster to pick up the
scoring slack, a problem prevalent
since last season.

Lady Panthers to break skid 

By Laurie Kubll
The Pitt News

Pitt women's basketball coach
Judy Saurer’s forecast of a trouble-
some schedule has pretty much
come true. Her slow-starting Lady
Panther hoopsters carry a l0-8 mark
into Hartford tomorrow to take on
their fourth Big East conference
rival of the season, the Connecticut
Huskies (8-9 overall, 0-4
conference).

The team heads to New England
on the heels of an extended weekend
down south, a trip that saw Pitt vic-
torious in overtime, bitterly defeated
and finally, chased out of South
Carolina by a Top 20 team.

“I think we're resilient," said
Saurer. “We'll approach [Connecti-
cut] a little differently from last
weekend. It's important because it's
a conference game, and we’re right
in thethick of things [as far as stand-

ings go]."

Pitt has added motivation,
according to Jennifer Bruce (23.9
ppg, 10.2 RBs). “Also, it's important
to win a road trip. One of their
coaches [Janet Dugan] went to Pitt,
and they really want to beat Pitt. But

“We need to play a
complete game up
there.”

-Judy Saurer

we want to beat them. I'm sure it'll
be a tough one, but we'll be ready.”

Bruce explained how she was able
to score 30 points this weekend
against South Carolina State, in a
game which her team won by six
points.

“I was playing more of my normal
position," she continued. “l was a
little out of position against Clem-
son and USC, out on the wing. My
strengths are down below, under the
hoop, which is where l was against
State.“

Teams often double-team Bruce,
who is l4th amongthe NCAA's Div.
I scorers, which forces Pitt to shoot
outside. This has been advantageous
for Kim Gannis, who scored l3
against USC. “They were packin‘ it

in on the big people, so l was open,"
she said.

“SC. State was a team game,”
added Stephanie Collins, who also
benefits from tight defenses. “Ba-
sically, I just go in now and shoot.
It's easy at first, when they fall in on
Jennifer and Julie." Against Clem-
son, Collins said Pitt was disorgan-
ized offensively and did not set up.

“I think the weekend had a posi-

tive effect,“ said Collins, who scored w,

38 points over the weekend. “We
played together as a team.“ The
long-range shooter presented
another reason for her team's defeat
of Connecticut.

“We lost the last Big East game we
played [at Seton Hall]," Collins said.
“It's important for the conference
standings, in order to receive a high
seeding at the conference
championships.“

The Huskies, coached by Jean
Balthaser, were smothered by St.
John's earlier in the week, according
to Coach Saurer.

“We need to play a complete game
up there," said Saurer. “It will be a
difficult game but nothing we can't
surpass, so long as we play our own
game."

Julie Callan summed it up a shade
differently: "Losing two games [in a
row], we‘re gonna want to win pretty
badly."

The Panther wrestling team
dropped its fourth straight match
with a 32-I4 loss at Kent State on
Wednesday night.

One of the bright spots for the
Panthers was a victory by Jeff Jelic
(I9-2) at I67 lbs., giving him 69
career victories and making him
Pitt's winningest wrestler.

Ironically, Jelic’s win came off a
forfeit.

“It's a heck of a way to break a
record; he deserved better than
that,“ said head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “But it‘s quite an accomp-
lishment, and I think everyone on
the team should be proud of him."

Kent State had weighed in an
opponent for Jelic but later decided
not to wrestle him.

The Panthers managed one pin in
the evening, coming at 126 lbs.,
when Pitt‘s Kyle Nellis downed
Kent's Rich Shrum in 1:50, but the

team gave up two falls, one at II8
lbs. and one at I77 lbs.

“Kyle did a real nicejob of coming
back and answering a pin with a
pin," said Stottlemyer, “but the
momentum went back to Kent State
when John Hnath lost at I34. That
was probably the turning point of
the match."

At 188 lbs., Panther Hal Bolin
gave up a fall to Kent State’s Rich
Rubusto in 3:56 before Nellis tied
the team score with his pin. Hnath
then went on to lose to senior Marty
Lucas I3-6.

With the absence of senior co-
captain Joe Throckmorton at 142
lbs., freshman Greg Zimmerman got
the call for Pitt but was forced to
default tojunior Rick Wilson due to
a leg injury.

At I50 lbs., senior Allen Childers
made it two in a row by downing
Pitt’s Greg Dille I7-I. Panther Joe
Bond, at 158 lbs., got the Panthers
back on the winning track by nar-
rowly defeating the Golden Flashes’
Dick Reed 6-4. Jelic was then
handed his forfeit at I67 lbs.

At 177 lbs., Kent State’s Doug
Dake put Pitt’s Kurt Joseph away in
5:38, while at I90 lbs., Doug Baker
squeaked past Panther Jack
Uppling 6-5.

At this point, Pitt gave up a team
penalty point when Stottlemyer
voiced his displeasure at a call by the
referee.

In the heavyweight match, new-
comer William Hinton of Pitt scored
his first victory with a big 9-3 win
over Kent’s Dave Gibson to close
out the action.

Panther record now falls to 3-6
overall and I-3 in Eastern Wrestling
League competition.

“Kent State had a very well-
balanced team, and it will continue
to improve because it is a relatively
young team,“ said Stottlemyer.
“Something we have to work on is
our intensity.

“You have to be able to go out and
hold your intensity all seven min-
utes. It you only have it for five, then
it’s going to hurt you, and that's
what we're doing. We also need to
build up our confidence — getting
the guys to believe in themselves.“

The Panthers now take a week off
before they travel to Ashland Col-
lege to take on Ashland and Eastern
Michigan in a tri-match on Wednes-
day, Feb. I.

Carnegie Institute——]anuary 28 to March 10,1984

.As the winter term enters its
fourth week and tests begin to
cram students’ schedules, an
exciting weekend awaits anyone
able to fit it into his plans.

“Art Forum" will begin its six-
week swing at Carnegie Institute
on ‘Saturday at 10 a.m. The series
will discuss the figure in art,
including the museum's special
exhibitions featuring the paint-
ing of contemporary artists Fair-
field Porter and Philip
Pearlstein.

The Pitt Program Council
presents a full slate of films this
weekend. Tonight and tomorrow
night, students can pay a dollar
to watch “Blue Thunder," an
adventurous tale of the most
lethal weapon ever made, at

David Lawrence Auditorium.
Those students and faculty up
for a world premiere production
can catch the City Theater's pro-
duction of “The Day of The Pie-
nic.” Ann Muffly stars as Betsy
Fullbright and Myrenna Haw-
thorne plays Denise Jones.

The second annual “Rhein-
land Karneval" will be held Sat-
urday, Jan. 28, in the Grand
Ballroom of Duquesne Univer-
sity. The Peter Karsti Orchestra
will be live on stage with all of the
traditional German festival
music.

will face Georgetown on Satur-
day for one of the biggest Big
East Games of the season.

sold out, it will be televised on
ABC (channel 4) at 12 p.m.

present “Gise1le," a ballet that
has been performed for 400

dule, there will be a Sunday mati-
nee beginning at 2 p.m. Tickets

As always, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse presents a different
film each night. “Life of Brian,”
