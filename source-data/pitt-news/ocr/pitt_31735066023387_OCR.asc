At least 300 Black Action Society (BAS) members and supporters march-

-ed across the Pitt campus Friday afternoon to protest what BAS considers
“regression and stagnation” in Pitt’s commitmentto blacks, including
Dean Jerome Rosenberg’s decision not to grant tenure to Black Studies
Professor Curtiss E. Porter. _ I A

The marchersjwho also voiced their opposition to the current operations
of the campus police, chanted slogans and displayed signs indicating their
displeasure as they made their way from the Towers lobby to University
and City Ministries on Fifth Avenue. During the march, the protesters
made stops on the first floor of Forbes Quadrangle and in the Commons'‘- 1
Room of the Cathedral of Learning. - '

At University and City Ministries, BAS chairperson Mona Riscoe read
the protestors a letter that has been sent to Chancellor Wesley Posvar. The

_, letter lists four demands: _
K‘? —That Porter be appointed a tenured associate professor of black
studies; ; r '

‘—That the black studies department receive resources to hire more facul-
ty and to reinstitute suchformer black studies programs as the black studies
journal and exchange programs to Africa and the West Indies; '

—That a concerted effort be made to hire more black faculty in all
departments of the university; and

—That a thorough investigation be made of the campus police, including
a study of "a BAS allegation that a: campus police officer shot a black youth
in December. . b

/ BAS states in the letter that it expects a reply from Posvar by March 3.

Bozik. . .
Campus Police Chief Curt Graham said he could not comment on the

‘ alleged shooting cited by BAS; a court case is pending, he said.
After reading the letter, Riscoe introduced Rev. Ben Chavis, a civil rights 7

leader who had been jailed for 4-and-a-half years in connection with racial
disturbances in Wilmington, N.C. in ‘I971. He was one of the main figures
in the controversial “Wilmington 10” trials, which -gained national atten-
tion in the mid-1970s. - ' .

Chavis commented the BAS and their supporters on their march, saying
that their organization and unity showed that the civil rights movement is
still strong. I

“As long as there are poor whites, Chicanos, Afro-Americans and others
that have been oppressed, we’re going to struggle,” Chavis said.

Addressing the university's denial of tenure to Porter, Chavis said that
the protesters were sending the university a clear message.

“(We’re saying) if you (the university) don’t give Curtiss Porter what
he’s' due, and that’s tenure, they’ll know that we're going to deal concretely
with the university,” he'said.

Porter spoke later at the rally. He said he was gratified by the turn-
out.‘ 1

1 “We have more power in 1980 than we did in 1968,” Porter said. In
1968 and 1969 Porter was actively involved in demanding a black studies
department and increasing the black enrollment at. Pitt.

Porter said that being denied tenure shows that University officials “are ‘

telling me I was not fit to live in the house that I built.” He served as chair-
man of black studies from 1975 to 1978.

Pitt’s Informal Program (PIP) is
a self-development organization,-
offering to the university and Pitts-

’ burgh commu 'ty an educational
alternative thr _ gh various courses,
workshops, study trips, and special
evem. PIP offers to anyone, at
any ‘age, the opportunity to meet
academic, vocational and - recrea-
tional needs.

“It’s a unique opportunity to
study with Pitt professors without
the pressures of homework, tests,
and grades,” said Nina Gowell,,

. PIPs director.

PIP invites various faculty
members to participate in a number’
of diverse programs,. she added.

offered to students, university
alumni, faculty and staff, and to in-
dividualsbver 60 years of age.

One goal of PIP is to develop in-
dividual themes within its pro-
grams. Study trips and related
courses are examples of this type of
programming.

“Polish Super Sunday” kicked
off one of PIPs major programs for
this year. A lecture series on Polish
culture and a language course are to
be followed by a study trip to
Poland in April. ’

One can participate in any or all
phases of the study trip program.
Other study trip programs include
excursions to China, Italy and

Egypt. 4.
According to Betty Balter, PIPs

study trip coordinator, “Trips are
special»-becauserof the educational _

aspectofthe trip combined with the
pleasure of going. By the time the
travelers do go, they are well in-
formed.” '

Study trips range from day-long
excursions to three-week cruises.

In‘ addition to these endeavors,
PIP also offers various recreational
programs. For skiers, they not only
offer entire weekend packages, they
also provide a weekly bus to Hidden
Valley Ski Resort.

Also available are courses rang-
ing _from ice skating to swimming.

People participate at their own
skill level and, according to Gowell,
“We do not hesitate at all to have
fun.”

10,000 people participating: in PIP
programming. They range from
students to people in the communi-

Said Gowell: “Pitt should offer
its resources to the community as a
means of broadening its constituen-

PIP is now 16-years old and still

growing. It had 2,000 participants‘

pertise with immediate information
gained by seven years of practical
application gained from counseling.
Crossroads is a detailed guide
that encompasses a whole process,
from the decision to go back to
school to job hunting techniques.
Each chapter is a step, a specific
phase in the process, including
chapters that deal with learning
how ‘to study again and
technical/vocational schools as an
alternative to college.’ »

Bostaph describes his book as “a
gestalt—a total feeling from begin‘: -
ning to end.” For those who don’t
need the whole book and may only
have a problem with what to major
in or whether to go on to graduate
school, each chapter can stand
alone and ~ provides helpful and
timely advice. As Ms. "Moore puts

it, “not everyone plugs in at the

same point.”

Crossroads, written in a lively,
friendly style and filled with case
histories, is designed to give adult
students confidence_ in their new
goals and help them plan enjoyable
careers. By listing the pros and
cons of the_ situation and including
personal skills inventories, the
authors hope the book will stir up
interest and help the adult find his
or her own values.

Bostaph and Moore have co-I

authored numerous articles that
have appeared in such magazines as
“Journal of College Placement,”
“Teacher,” «“Journal of College
Student Personal” and “Co__n-
tinuum.” Also, Crossroads is being
used as a text at Michigan State.

  Kabul Divided Byi U.S.S.R., Milita

By The Associated Press

NEW DELHI, India—Soviet
troops have blocked access to
bridges over the river through
Kabul, splitting the Afghan capital
in two in an apparent attempt to
protect the Soviet Embassy and a
Russian housing area after three
days of street violence, reports from
Kabul said Sunday.

In Bonn, West Germany, a
magazine said President Carter ask-
ed former Chancellor Willy Brandt
on Feb. 15 to act as mediator be-
tween the Soviet and the West in the
Afghan crisis.

1*}

There was no-immediate com-
ment on the report in Der Spiegel
from either Brandt or U.S. of-
ficials.

But a spokesman for" Brandt’s
Social Democratic Party, which the
Nobel Peace Prize winner still
heads, said the report contained
material that was “more speculative
than helpful or useful.”

Afghan sources here said Vice
President Sultan Ali Kishtmand,
earlier reported wounded in a Kabul
shooting incident Feb. 7, died
following unsuccessful medical
treatment in Moscow. The date of

his death was not known.
Afghanistan’s Marxist govern-
ment has not confirmed the death
of Kishtmand, considered a strong
backer of President Ba_brak Kar-
mal. But government-run
newpapers earlier reported Kisht-
mand, an economist-turned-
politician, had gone to the Soviet
Union for an undisclosed medical
problem. I

The apparent aim in block ac—-
cess to bridges across the Kabul
River was to increase security
around the Soviet Embassy, the
modern housing complex where

\

many Russians live, thetstrategic
Bala Hissar Fortress and the old
bazaar. »
One report from Kabul received‘
in New Delhi said Karmal’s govern-
ment declared Saturday a special
holiday. This was interpreted as a
move to cover official embarrass-
ment over the non-appearance of
many government workers during
the third day of the general strike.

A rebel group in Pakistan said
Sunday its guerrillas killed 150
government troops and damaged
five tanks in recent clashes in the
eastern province of Nangarhar. In-

PH-ILADELPHIA—.-City of-

ficials, searching for a theme to

match the popularity of “I »Love
New r York,” have dumped an
advertising slogan prepared by pros
and are listening to ideas from the
man in the street.

The $1-million-a-year theme,
“Surprising Philadelphia,” was rul-
ed too negative last month by City
Representative Richard Doran, who
said the slogan implied it would be a
surprise to enjoy oneself in the City
of Brotherly Love.

Since then, Doran has collected
several hundred letters, two tote

bags, two T-shirts, three songs and
a record—all amateur ‘offerings
touting the glories of Philly. .

He said many of the suggestions
make heavy P’ use of the “ph”
sound—-as ‘in «“Phantastic
Philadelphia” and “Phabulous
Philadelphia.” ,

Another turned around W.C.
Fields’ mythical epitaph-—“On the
whole, I’d rather be in
Philadelphia”—-by suggesting
“Philly’s Alive W.C. Fields Isn’t”
for a city theme.

Some of the sloganeers have
demanded meetings with Doran, he
said, or have advocated their ideas

Youths Hospitalized; 2
Drank Anti -f reeze

By The Associated Press

TITUSVILLE, ‘Pa.-——Six youths
were hospitalized Sunday, one in
serious condition, after apparently
drinking wood alcohol or anti-
freeze, according to authorities in
this northwestern Pennsylvania
town.

A total of 15 Titusville area
youths, ranging in age from 11 to
16, were treated at Titusville
Hospital for ill effects from the
drink.

Four were admitted to Titusville
Hospital, where they were reported
in stable condition.

Two more were transferred to St.
Vincent Hospital in Erie. A

.15-yea_r-old boy was admitted to the
intensive care unit in serious condi-

tion and placed on a kidney
machine. a 16-year-old girl was
reported in fair condition.

The other youths were treated at
Titusville Hospital and released.

Police said that sometime over
the weekend youths found a clear
substance in a jar marked with the
homemade label “Alcohol” near a
bridge in Drake Well Park on the
outskirts of town. I

Police said the liquid was mixed
with soft drinks and consumed.
They said there was no organized
party and that the jar was apparent-
ly passed around at random.

The stricken youths began arriv-
ing at the hospital Sunday.

Bases In Middle East Could Add ‘Teeth’ To Foreign Policy‘ I 

By JOSEPH C. HEIM

With the recent passage of events

in the Middle East, a new idea has_

entered the bag of United _States
policy makers. The new idea is one
that seems to have the backing of
segments of the American public
who feel that it will give “teeth”; to
a foreign policy that is lacking in
such. The new idea, the concept of
basing a United States military
presence in the region known as the
Middle East is really not all that
novel, it just seems to be in vogue
again. I -

There has always been at least a
limited U.S. military presence in the
area. For example, the U.S.'Navy

. still retains a base at Bahonia in the

Persian Gulf. In the past, there

have been'numerous times when ad-
ditional increases in the form of ac-
tual basing (as contrasted with the
current naval presence in the Per-
sian Gulf) have been considered.
During the 1973 Yom Kippur War,
there was a very real possibility of
U.S. troops being placed between
the then competing Egyptian-Israeli
forces. Prior to Hale Seilaisse’s
overthrow, there had been a U.S.
monitoring station in Eritrea.
, Following the 1973 oil crisis, a wide-
ly discussed scenario was
mulated by Robert Tucker of John
Hopkins University which envision-
ed United States military forces
securing Persian Gulf oil fields in
the event of a “crisis.” Thus, the
concept is not novel, but rather is in
vogue again, seemingly in response

for- ~

to events in Iran and Afghanistan.
Importantly, there are mixed
results of basing a military presence
in the Middle East, providing, of
course, there is a host government.
Military presence alone does not of-
fer easy translation into political
gain, and may often be ‘ counter-
productive. If one accepts, at _least
in general terms, that a goal of
policy is to influence events, groups
or person in a manner that is consis-

tent with overall objectives, then‘

importantly, the utility of military
bases must be. addressed in relation
to this framework. The problem is
addressed by William Quandt in a
recent article entitled “The Middle
East Crisis” states “Bases or
facilities may or may not be useful
in a'strictly military sense, but if

they serve to weaken aregime they
may be politically counterproduc-
tive.”

In addition, we must also con-

sider how others will view our ac-
tions, as many noted political scien-
tists have stated. For example, a
U.S. base in Haita, Israel would do
much to sharpen a “hostile” image
in certain elements in the Arab

~w'orld. Likewise, although a naval

base in Berbesa, Somalia might of-
fer presence in the Red Sea, it might‘
not enhance our position with
respect to the Organization of
African Unity (OAY), which is op-

posed _to Somalia or the issue of .

Ogaden.

This does not however mean that
military presence is not credible.
The military avenue of inﬂuence

can be a channel of focus, though it 1

is my belief that its utility is limited
and often counterproductive. Im-
portantly, the military presence in

"the form of a base is one way of

focusing, a form of “leverage,” in

the words of an especially noted ‘

professor of international relations.

Thus, in conclusion, before bas-
ing or expansion of bases can be
considered, two areas should be ex-
amined. First, consequences or
utility, to the U.S. and to the regime
where we are basing, as well as the
regional context. Secondly, in-
tegration, how does basing jell with

overall goals and is it likely to in- V I

ﬂuence events in the direction of ‘

those goals. Perhaps a rule might . ""1.

be “look and listen before basing.”

Recognition Of A Serious Problem; lPi’r’r's ineffective Solution

By BARRY GLUNT

On‘ Feb. 5, Pitt “functionary”
Conney Kimbo, presented the
administration’s new dormitory
visitation regulations to over a
thousand students at David
Lawrence Auditorium. The stated
intention of these new regulations
was to promote the personal safety
of women and to “bring Pitt in line
with other major universities.” Stu-
dents recognized them as a denial of

their individual rights and sent Kim-

bo packing.

After a flurry" of headlines,
editorials and meetings, Pitt’s
board of trustees approved the

substance of these new regulations.
at their last meeting. Effective May

1, any member of the opposite sex
will be prohibited from sharing a
room with a dorm resident’ from 2
a.m. to 10 a.m., Monday through
Friday. As a “concession” to stu-
dent protests the “open visitation”

‘policy on weekends was retained,’ at

least for the time being. _ .

This action-reaction between
students and Pitt power structures
shows how absolutely cynical Pitt is
in its so-called concern for the per-
sonal _safety of women, in the
dorms, since it is precisely on

weekends that the greatest p-ropor- -

tion of rapes occur. It also shows
how much students must learn.
Because students never linked
defense of their individual rights to
the problems of preventing rape,
Pitt imanaged to side—step both
issues. _4

Rape is a serious issue, and few
people are aware of the dimensions
that it has taken on in the last years.
Bearing in mind that anywhere

. from one in five to one in_fifty rapes
- go unreported, the FBIs statistics

show" that rape is increasing at a
faster rate than any other violent
crime and that one out of every
three women will be raped at some
point in her life.

However, Pitt cannot create a
safe campus by denying‘ the in‘-
dividual rights of students. ‘A
recent survey released by the U.S.
Department Justice’s Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration
(LEAA) challenges the factual
validity of any claim Pitt makes as
to preventive value of its security-
belt tightening. The new visitation
regulations only cover the hours of
2 a.m. to 10 a.m., but LEAA
statistics show that the greatest
percentage of rapes occur before
midnight. Further, Pitt’s new
visitation regulations only regulate
students in their rooms. LEAA
statistics show that only eighteen

percent of all rapes and attempted‘
rapes occur  the. victgims. home, .

while fourty-seven percent occur in-

. some open public place like a street,

park or basement laundry room.ad-
jacent to a parking garage.

By failing to raise the issue of

rape_ prevention, students allowed
the administration to impose more
restrictions on their personal lives

and to totally ignore the task of im-
plementing a factually grounded

.program of rape prevention.

Students need to raise these facts to

the administration and to each
other. I
In the meantime, Pitt is well

Pitt's Recognition And Dealings With A Serious Problem "

(‘Continued from page 9)
aware of the kind of security
measures that are most beneficial to
their own interests. A key issue that
directs Pitt’s thinking on dormitory
regulations is student enrollment.

According to the University Plan
for the 80s, enrollment here will be
down by 16,000 students in 1990.
This will put enrollment here at the
1968 level of about 20,000 students.
Pitt officials blame the shrinking

population of young adults, but this
population is only shrinking at a
rate of two percent a year, and this
is not enough to account for the loss
of 16,000 students over the next ten
years.

Dormitory housing is currently
overcrowded, it has been for years.
Yet Pitt has not built any new hous-
ing for students because of the
decrease in enrollments they are
planning. More interference in the
personal affairs of students will
mean that more students will at-
tempt to rent tenements in South
Oakland. This would be fine with
the Pitt administration (and fine
with the landlords, too). Lack of
adequate housing near the univer-
sity, along with constantly increas-
ing tuition rates is a major reason
more students do not attend Pitt.
Pitt» in turn uses decreased enroll-
ment figures to cut back on student
oriented programs, praise activity
fees, etc.

The net effect of the administra-
tion’s proposed tightening of visita-
tion rights will be to tighten the

' housing market along with the per-

sonal lives of students. As demand
for housing goes up, so do rents and
all students will find it that much
harder to secure housing and that
much harder to come to Pitt.
Black students will suffer doubly
from this move. -Two-thirds of all
white students come from the Pitts-
burgh area. The situation is dif-
ferent for black students; two-
thirds of whom come from outside
the Pittsburgh area, mostly from
Philadelphia. This_ admissions
policy forces most black students to
live in the dorms or in apartments if
they ‘want to attend Pitt. The
overall tightening of the housing
market caused by Pitt’s new
“security” measures means that

more black students will be kept

away from ‘Pitt.
Given that Pitt is using decreased

enrollments as a rationale for cut-
ting student-oriented programs,
and that Pitt’s proposed changes in
dormitory regulations will mean a
direct decrease in the numbers of
black students attending Pitt, what
future is there for student-oriented
programs for blacks? U-CEP, the
University Community Education
Project, a special admissions pro-
gram, that has brought the majority

' of black students to Pitt is talked

about in the U-Plan in the followiﬁ
terms: “We must strive to protect
programs. . .li_ke U-CEP . . .but given
the development of new programs
such as Business Majors,’ the
Honors Program, and other special
programs there may be no need to
resort to the admission of lesser '
qualified students.”

I am not saying that Pitt is clamp- '
ing down on dorm residents in
order to cut black programmingn
Their motivation may be simply due
to ignorance,- or a desire to main- L
tain a good media image, or to un-
crowd the dorms without building
new ones, or to provide protection
to students which they believe
students are unable to provide for
themselves. But the record shows
that students are and have been the
first to be concerned about security.
It is the administration that has
stood by idly while students have at-
tempted to organize self-defense
measures on campus.

LEAA statistics also show that a
woman who defends herself from
attack has a greater likelihood of
saving herself from being raped.
Self-defense seems to be the best
means of rape prevention. _-Police
admit being unable to prevent rape, -
and Pitt’s effort to regulate the per-
sonal lives of students is a hopeless-

ly inadequate preventive measure ~-
- and a clearidenial of established stu-

dent rights.

Integration

01‘ Studies

Perhaps I am a blind fool, and
perhaps I am uninformed, but it
seems to me that there is a serious 
question that the advocates of. the
black studies program must ask
themselves. Why is it that Pitt has
no Chinese studies department, no
European studies, Spanish studies,
Jewish studies, Moslem_studies, or
any other suchldepeartments? In
the answer, I feel we can get to the
heart of the matter. Black history
and culture, like all of the others I
have mentioned and many more,
should be taught to all students of
history and culture. Why do
students want segregation in their

studies instead of integration? Why .9
' is it that our university can not truly

integrate our studies and give us a
comprehensive education in all of
the worlds peoples and cultures. If
black history is "your thing, you
should be able to get more than you
can handle from the history depart-
ment. If you can’t, why not protest
to fix the history department. Why
must we segregate when it is really
integration that we want? I am
sincerely interested in learning and I
want to know why the history
department isn’t doing what black
studies is trying to do. I want to
know why we should encourage

segregation of knowledge by supﬁx

porting Black Studies rather than
supporting its integration into the
rest of our school.

By N ICK“ ARN ETT

At about two 'o’clock Friday
morning, I woke up to the insistent
beeping of my pager. By the time
its alarm finished and it began to
speak, I was wide awake.

“Nick, this is Bob. We have a
two-alarm fire on Howe Street in
Shadyside. ’ ’ -

It was my friend Bob Myers,
emergency services supervisor for
th‘E3Salvation Army. For the past
three years, I’ve helped him operate
the canteen which goes to‘ every
multiple-alarm fire in the city.
We’ve been busy lately—there’ve
been an unusual number of serious
fires. .

On weeknights, I generally don’t‘
go to fires unless they’-r_e news-
worthy. We’ve put together an effi-
cient volunteer team which handles
most. To keep track of the fire,.I

turned on my police and fire radio’s.. ,

went off again.’ \ -
“Nick, this is Bob. We’ve got a

“How can you tell people wha

The Eastern Athletic Association
standings, securely tied in knots

1 after the weekend’s games, have

finally. been unraveled. The Pan-
thers, after their 83-76 loss to
Rutgers in Piscataway, slipped into
a three-way tie with George
Washington and St. Bonaventure
for fourth. By virtue of Pitt’s
regualar season wins over the pair,
the Panthers have been awarded a
higher standing.

Figuring who finished after Pitt
was also a matter of comparing
head-to-head competition: GW

 

First-Round Eastern Eight Matchups

Massachusetts (0-10) at Villanova (7-3)
St. Bonaventure (5-5) at Rutgers (7-3)
West Virginia (4-6) at Duquesne (7-3)
George Washington (5-5) at Pitt (5-5)

(All games played tomorrow night)

beat the Bonnies, 81-76 in January.
Therefore, the Colonials will take
the floor against Pitt tomorrow at
the Field House in an ,8 p.m.

" Eastern Eight playoff opener.

The league also ended in a three-
way tie for first place, but here the
solution was not as simple.
Villanova, Duquesne and Rutgers
all finished with 7-3 records.
Villanova beat Rutgers twice in
regular season. Fine. But the Wild
Cats lost to Duquesne, and the
Dukes were beaten by Rutgers.

In such cases, according to EAA
tie-breaker rules, overall records are
then considered. Here Villanova
gets the nod and will play cellar-
dweller Massachusetts. Second-
place Duquesne takes on West
Virginia and Rutgers meets St.
Bonaventure.

Of all four games tomorrow only

the Villanova ‘contest looks like a
sure thing. The W1lC1CaIS have now

won the regular season champion-
ship three times in as many years,
while UMass was 0-10 in EAA play

Panther

By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt men’,s track team visited
the Great Lakes State of Michigan
this past weekend for the second
consecutive week, and the results
this time were even better than their
first visit there. After ﬁnishing
tenth out of 25 teams last weekend
at the Central Collegiate Champ-
ionships in Ann Arbor, the Pan-
thers rose to new heights this
weekend placing in the top five at
the Eastern Michigan Invitational
at Ypsilanti, Michigan.

Darren Geary joined the ranks of»
several other Panthers while quali-
fying for nationals with a time of
l:5l.5 in the 880-yard run, good for
second place. Teamate Terry

‘A, Gallagher ﬁnished right behind

Geary with a time .ofl:52.8.

this year, Last season, -a con-
siderably better UMass team took
Villanova into overtime before los-
ing in the opening round of the
tournament. 1

Duquesne beat WVU twice this
year, but look for tomorrow’s game
at the Civic Arena to be a close
brawl. Rutgers didn’t play St.
Bonaventure this season; this game
could be a toss-up if the Bonnies are
shooting well. ‘

Which brings us back to
Oakland. Pitt has eliminated GW
in the opening round for the past
two seasons. The Panthers also
scored a surprisingly easy 21-point
win over the Colonials at the Field
House in early January without
Sammie Ellis. According to coach
Tim Grgurich, the regular season
win doesn’t really mean much at
playoff time. /

“Emotionally, we’ll be going into
this game, totally different,” he
said. “Now each garrie could be
our last and each guy on the team
has to say, ‘This is it.”’

Pitt entered its game against
Rutgers Saturday greatly relieved
that it had finally secured a home
court tournament opener by beating
Villanova earlier in the week.

The Villanova game was also a
boost for morale, but such was not
the case in Piscataway. Pitt came
out sleep-walking again, a’ problem
which has plagued the Panthers for
over three weeks. and has been part-
ly accountable for five losses in

seven games. Rarely had Pitt look- .

ed worse this season than it did in
the first half, when Rutgers jumped
into the driver’s seat and drove
away to a 48-26 halftime lead.

The 16-10 Panthers woke up mid-
way through the second half to
score 50 points after intermission,
but_ by then it was too late. Sam
Clancy was game leader in both
scoring (18 points) and rebounds
(18); Carlton Neverson, Ellis and
Dave Olinger had 12,‘ 14 and 14
points a piece.

“I don’t have the answer as to
why we have played this way for
three weeks,” said Grgurich.
“Ever since the Duke game, the in-
tensity just hasn’t been there.

followed with a time of 1:14.

Larry Shippen took fifth place in
the 440-meter dash while being
clocked at 49.1. 

“It was Larry’s lifetime best in

said.

The mile relay team of Shippen,
Cooper, Dwayne DeFoor, and Al
Coles continued to look impressive
as they finished third with a time of

their mark of «3:22 which they ran
two weeks ago in the Championship

No school takes its wrestling
more seriously than Clarion State
College. And that was never more
evident than Saturday afternoon at
the Field House when the Golden
Eagles arrived, along with a group
of cheerleaders, a boisterous bunch

of Theta" Chi fraternity brothers

and a mascot that looked like a
frizzed-out version of the Pirate
Parrot. The entire Clarion con-
tingent was intent on clinching their
I73-st Eastern Wrestling ' League
championship and they ‘didn’t
disappoint the folks back home as
the Golden Eagles clawed the Pan-
thers 29-6.

The electricity that spread
through the crowd at the Field
House was only a sample of what
will take place at the EWL cham-
pionships Feb. 29 and March 1 at
Clarion. Just one prime example
shown Saturday of the fierce com-
petition that is ahead for wrestling
fans, was the heavyweight clash bet-
ween Clarion’s Jack Cambell and
Pitt’s Steve “Smokey” Smochar-
ski.

Smocharski and Cambell, along
with Cleveland State’s Tim Payne,

are expected to battle it out at the‘

EWL’s for the qualifying spots in
the NCAA championship. The first
two wrestlers from the EWL tour-
nament, along with an assortment
of wild-card representatives, will
move on to the NCAAS.
Smocharski and Cambell went at
each other right away as repeatedly
Smocharski caught Cambell off-
balance and was able to bring him
down. Unfortunately, most of‘ the
time Cambell landed off the mat
and onto the hardwood basketball
floor. At one point it appeared that

_ Cambell had injured his elbow and

would not be able to continue, but
the burly Golden Eagle shook it off
and resumed the match. '
After two periods,. with the help
of a Smocharski takedown and a-

pair of Cambell escapes, the score
was tied 2-2; Taking the top posi-
tion for the final period, Cambell,
amidst chanting from the Clarion
fans. was able to control Smochar-
ski for the entire third_ period.
Twice Cambell ﬂipped Smocharski
momentarily on his back, picking
up two points each for near falls.
That, coupled with a point for

riding time and a point against
Smocharski for stalling, allowed
Cambell to eke out a closer than
would appear 8-2 victory and-set up

a more intense re-match at the

EWL’s.

However, by the time- the
heavyweight match rolled around,
Clarion had already tucked the
EWL title into its hip pocket. The

 

Golden Eagles finished with a 11-3
overall mark which included a
perfect 6-0 record in EWL competi-
tion. ‘

  Record Victory

Pill News Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team got back on track Saturday,
despite several injuries to several
important performers in a tri-meet
win over Temple and Indiana (Pa.).
Pitt racked up a grand total of
132.75 to Indiana’s 116.90 and
Temple’s 80.55. The Temple team,
also crippled by injuries and the flu,
brought only hree performers to
the meet, thus the low score. '

“It was 21 gr )d meet,” said coach
Donna Sanft. “We had few falls
and I think the team got a lot of
theirlconfidence back. ’ Now they
know they can hit.”

One highlight for the Panther-
ettes was freshman Babbie Flock,
who had what Sanft called one of
her best days ever. Flock took top
honors in one event, the balance

» beam with an 8.75.

“Her score was actually an 8.85,,
but because she was three seconds
under the requirement, they took
off .15,” said Sanft. “It was one of
the cleanest, smoothest routines
I’ve seen her do. In fact, she had
such a super day, it had to be one of
Babbie’s best meets all year.”

Flock’s beam routine was nearly
flawless, despite containing four
aerial moves. She did a front flip,
two back flips and an original
move, a side aerial with a leg switch
on the landing.

“Her routine had loads of dif-
ficulty,” Sanft added, “and she
went without a fall.” ‘

Concerning the teams’ injuries,
Sanft was pleased with the perfor-

mance of those individuals.

“I’m happy that Bonnie
(Tressler) did well,” the coach said.
“Considering that she is not at 100
percent, she did a great job.”

Tressler indeed did do well, as she
placed third in the all-around with a

‘ score of 33.75. Pantherette Roxann

Evans tied Temple’s Beth Johnson
for top honors in the all-around
with 34.35.


Holly Martino did not compete
again due to an ankle injury, but
Sanft said she hopes to be able to
put her in the lineup next week at
Ohio State.

Myra Bachuchin, plagued by in-
juries all season, competed in the ,
uneven bars Saturday and scored a
respectable 7.85.

Evans won the unevens, along
with the vault and floor exercise.
She scored an 8.75 in the unevens,
an 8.8 in the vault and an 8.75 in the
ﬂoor. _

Another highlight of the’ meet
was the vaulting of r Gretchen
Speich. She had an 8.45 Saturday,

. andlaccording to Sanft has been hit-

ting her vault consistently in the last
few meets.

The scoring in Saturday’s meet
was consistent, but consistently
low, according to Sanft.

“Sometimes I truly don’t under-
stand where these judges are com-
ing from,” she said. “There were
two judges from the state and two

nationally rated judges. The two

state judges ‘were very low on .the
girls, while the national judges
rated us high. I think we should
have scored 133.5 or higher.”

Pitt News Staff Writer‘

When Valley. Forge is mentioned,
thoughts of George Washington
and his men freezing in the bitter
cold are brought to mind, but some-
day, Valley ‘ Forge may ‘be
remembered as the hometown of
United States Olympic Ice“Hockey
Team hopeful, Tom Robinson.

Robinson, a Pitt sophomore ma-i‘
joring in civil engineering, has been
playing: ice hockey since he was in
seventh grade. He- played on.a town

oéponsored team in Randolph, MA.

“No one else inmy family plays
ice hockey. Some of my friends
asked me to play street hockey,” he
said, “so I did and I liked it and
then I started playing ice hockey.”

Robinson's idol, Bobby Clarke,
is a hustling Philadelphia Flyer.
Robinson, himself, was a member
of the hmior Flyer squad which was
comprised" of selected players, from

__;,southern New Jersey, Delaware,

and ‘Pennsylvania. The team com-
petede. against teams in New York,
_New Jersey, Connecticut, Massa-
chusetts,‘ and Virginia.

His favorite memory was when
the Junior Flyers made it to the na-
tional competition and were able to
compete againsttough teams from
Minnesota and California.

Being a hockey player a Pitt is
quite different than being a football
player. While the latter could be
the recipient of a full scholarship,
the former receives no sort of

-- scholarship at al}. Robinson has to
be dedicated to hockey becuse. the
only money hockey players receive
is from.-the student government. -
Each ‘player has to pay dues and pay
for his own equipment.

Many athletes think that a walk
up to the Field House is a long trek
but Robinson wishes that that was
as far as he has to travel to get to
practice. Twice a week he jumps in-
to his car and drives about thirty‘
minutes to reach the Lakeview~ Ice

. Rink in Valencia, Pa. Thus another
added expense for him.

Before the season actually begins,
the players go through condition-
ing: playing ‘soccer and lifting
weights. Once the season is under-
way the one-and-a-half hour prac-

   

  

   

 

  
  
   
    

tices involve'“§kating, passing, and
shooting drills. ' I

In recent years, violence in
hockey has often"been in the news.
Robinson says, “I sometimes get in-
to ﬁghts. They’re usually caused by
frustration on both sides.”

Earlier in the season Robinson in-
jured his knee.

“I was checking someone,” he

said. “I was hit and my-—knee went‘

sideways. During ‘theterm break
I had therapy: lifting weights and

ultrasound, which sends shocks ‘

through your knee to get the blood
flowing.”

Robinson said he feels that scor-
ing is the most difficult thing in
hockey; trying to beat a goalie in a
six-by-four goal.

""“*””'i‘MTﬁfiiiI‘i7“" 'é ' “

_’¢-§E'5’{TI98Il5;-"3‘l‘tl§"é”’.I‘i"’»

"’."f€‘-.3 59"" ‘ i. ~r.- .
  «-1.. " ‘

 

“It’s ‘different than basketlgigall,-I’

he said, “where a player has direct:

p(<._u

contact with the ball. You have ‘to ”

handle-the_puck with your sti’c'k5..”

Infthe future Robinson hopesfm .

try out for the U.S. Olympic Ice
Hockey Team. He also plans to ob-

tain if degree in engineering.

.The hockey team’s record, is ‘ ’

6-6-1. Of the remaining games
Robinson feels that the toughest
games will be against Navy at -An
napolis on March 1 and 2. '

As far as fan support, “there is
little ornone. The ice rink is too far
away. At the Duquesne game when
we played at the Civic Arena there
were about seven hundred people
there,” he said. “Everybody that I
talked to said they enjoyed it."

for the Golden Eagles, the Panthers
made a run at Clarion as Jeff Gor-

SHOWCASE Interview

Eenrry White Remembers,

Talks About

By WALTER WATSON

When one thinks of jazz/ rock fusion, the ‘

music’s predecessors and pioneers. the
legendary Return To Forever quartet of the
early to mid-70s comes into focus.

Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Al

DiMeola and‘ Lenny White were in the '

forefront of the fusion art form. Although
Miles Davis had a hand in some of the
musical concepts developed by John
McLaughlin (who later formed the
Mahavisnu Orchestra), Tony Williams (the
Tony Williams Lifetime, with McLaughlin,
as well as the V.S.O.P. quintet in the.Six-
ties, with Freddie Hubbard and I-Ierbie
Hancock), Joe Zawinul (Weather Report)
and Chick Corea (Return To Forever), the
recruited talent in these groups often lead to
individuals sharing in creative .encounters of
the explosive kind. One of those special
musicians from that era is Lenny White.
White at age 19 was a drummer with
Davis during the revolutionary Bitches
Brew sessions. There, he met Corea, and
was later invited to join as a charter
member of RTF, playing with the band for
nearly four years. In 1976, after the release
of the quartet’s last album together,
“Romantic Warrior,” the band split accor-
dingto rumors of alleged in-house fighting.
Now a solo artist, the self taught musi-

cian has been recording with a wide variety
of musicians, leading to the formation three »

years ago of the Lenny White Group. While
changing record labels (from Nemperor to
jazz/ fusion division of Elektra/Asylum),
White has further explored his rhythmic
sense, intensity and drumming power that

' made him a qualified and necessary
pacemaker with RTF in the 70s. Now on .

tour with most of the band’s personnel
from four years ago, Twennynine ‘featuring
Lenny White, is promoting their latest
album, Best of Friends with the gold R & B
soul single, _“Peanut Butt_er.” -

After a weekend that saw the-opening

concerts in San Francisco performing with
Rufus, White granted this exclusive
telephone interview with Showcase on Feb.

11 from Los Angeles, hours before playing

two shows at the Roxy. -

White and his band will be appearing I

tommorrow at the Stanley Theatre for an 8
p.m. show with Ronnie Laws.

The following is an excerpt form the LA
conversation.

SHOWCASE: Has reggae music ever been

an influence on your drumming?

WHITE: Not so much, not really. Latin
music did have a great influence on my
drumming, but not reggae music, not at all.
We did do a tune on the last album called
“Sound of J amacia” that we didn’t release.
That is kind of a reggae tune, but I didn’t

’ release it on this record, maybe it’llcome

out on a later record.

SHOWCASE: On the album, Astral
Pirates, there was some mention from the
press that you planned on doing a full-
length animated version of Astral Pirates.
Are you still planning to do that?

The Present

WHITE: It’s just not up to me. I would
need the vehicle, the leeway to do that.

' Somebody would have to sponsor that,

y’know. I would love to be able to do it, but
the situation is now such that I have no
outlet. '
SHOWCASE: Would you use it as part of
your show, or would you put it out in movie
theaters?
WHITE: I would put it out in cartoon
animation in theaters.

* SHOWCASE: What do you think of the
catergorizing of music and artists today, by
the radio, the recording companies, and the

public? 2 . '-

WHITE: I would hope that it would some-
day get to the point where musicians could
move-a lot freer. I can’t really say that it
will change. The record companies are at

fault with that also. Trying tocatergorize ' A
music, and say ‘this is what_it is.’ It makes it .

easier to sell to people. But I really do see a
change, not drastic, but it is a change, in
radio formats. A lot of radio formats across
the country are becoming more progressive
and playing a lot of different kinds of music
instead of playing just one style and I think

as a general trend, that I hope will take hold .

throughout the country someday.

SHOWCASE: You’ve been‘ in rehearsal
studios, lately, preparing for this tour. Are
you putting together any new unrecorded
material, that has the possibility of being
performed on the road trip?

WHITE: No. I just finished producing a I

record with Larry Dunn for another artist
on Elcktra named Sylvia St. James. And I
used the band on the record and so, like, we
were pretty much occupied with doing that
and Ihad two days to put together a tour.
Literally two days. So like, we just rehears-
ed for two days. We rehearsed the music
that we did on the album. And I’m doing
some music from the “Streamline” album
also. So, it’s just between the “Streamline”
album and the ‘_‘Best of Friends” album.
SHOWCASE: ‘Who are the members on
this tour? 7 - I
WHITE: On this tour it’s Nick Moroch on
guitar, Eddie Martinez on ‘guitar, Don
I Blackman on keyboards, Skip "Anderson on
- keyboards,‘ Barry Sonjohn on bass, and
myself. And possiblly I’ll be taking a lady
by the name of Lyn Davis. We’re working
that out right now. She sang with’ George
Duke. Q _ A I ’
SHOWCASE: What role do you think‘ a
, drummer shouldplay in a band? .
.'WHITE: Well, I think a drummer is like
traffic cop, the traffic light in a band. He
directs the ﬂow of the music, and the pulse
and also the energy level. And when the
band shifts gears, it’s up to the drummer.

r And y’know, like, a band is just as good as

its drummer. .

SHOWCASE: What was it like playing
with Return To Forever? _
WHITE: It was a nice learning experience.
SHOWCASE: Why did you leave Return
To Forever-? Were there personal dif-
ferences?

WHITE: I would like to set the story ‘

CITY

In the February 23rd issue of
Billboard magazine, DiCesare-Engler
Productions promoted seven out of
the 21 top grossing shows in the
country for Arenas (6,000 to 20,000).
Billboard’s survey is based on gross
box office receipts for the week of
February 2nd through the 10th.The
Styx/Babys concert on February 4th
at the Civic Arena was fifth among
all concerts in the country placing
behind four separate Eagles/Amaz-
ing Rhythm Aces concerts in Texas
and Lousiana. Also on the list were
five Sha Na Na and one Blue Oyster
Cult concerts produced out of Pitts-
burgh by DiCesare-Engler. The'Ted-
dy Pendergrass/Marsha Warfield
shows (Feb. 5 & 6) atthe Stanley
Theater were the largest grossing
auditorium shows (under 6,000),
while the B.B. King/Bobby Blue
Bland concert was fourth among
auditoriums. Not a bad-week for

' DiCesare-Engler.

Prismatic is the band largely based
in Detroit that has called on the
musical influences of Afro-cuban
and Latin American rhythms in addi-
tion to the melodies fo urban
American and the tropics to shapeta
fusion of different musical forms into
one-blended sound. In the space of

A 14 months, the group has opened in

many cities, including Chicago and
New York,.,_ for reggae stars Jimmy
Cliff and Peter ‘Tosh; jazz and ‘fusion
artists Jean-Luc Ponty, Carla Bley,
Sea Level, Spyro Grya, Stanley
Clarke, Gong, and Lenny White, as
well as for the popular rock sounds
of Peter Frampton. '

It may not be accidental that this /

group has risen in such a short time,
earning the right to share the same
stages as popular jazz, rock, and
Jamaican musicians. Guitarist Earl
Klugh, a jazz recording star. in his
own right, is quoted as saying of the
‘group, “I feel that Prismatic has a
unique direction and a valid one.”

The six-member band is lead by .

guitarist/keyboardist Michael Col-
one.» Prismatic’s polyrhythmic crew is
_ rounded out by bassist Joe Braus,
drummer Tom “Crafty” Kalep,
Roberto Kuypers, ~ on percussion,
vocalist ,.Pen,eluna, the group’s only
female member, and David Rein-
stein, reeds andkeyboards.
Prismatic is touring primarily the
college circuit. Their original
material will be on display at 8 p.m.
this Thursday night- at David
Lawrence Hall.
Pitt Union Program Council, admis-
sion is free and open to Pitt students.
The concert is a great opportunity to
see the band and judge for yourself
their potential.

‘Songs ThatArie-Danceable’ 

H)

By GEORGE SHANER

A strong rock ’n’ roll band based V

on Arimal House? Not really, ex-
cept that ﬂick was the catalyst that
got Eddie and The Otters together.
It started when lead vocalist Ed-

die Townsend and guitarist Doug
Deluxe wanted to do a toga party at
Chatham College. Being unsure
about the music they wanted to
play, they hooked up with bass
player Jimmy Ramone and drum-
mer Mike Kolesar, aka,The
Psychotic Petunias. As the
PCt‘lnl9.S, Ramone and Kolesar had
released an independent single
featuring “Louie, Louie” in early
’78 and were up on the necessary R
& B material. The actual name of _
the new group was going to be Otis
and The Otters (another inspiration
from Animal House), but Townsend
did not see -himself being referred to
as Otis for the rest of his life, so
Eddie it was. In any case, The ‘Ot-
ters did their first show at Chatham

on Sept. 16th, 1978 and have been
playing ever since.

The Otters are known as a good
time band, and that was the original
a.nd only intent of the members.
Deluxe commented that the group
was formed as a party band with
the intent of disbanding in 1979, no
serious plans being made for the
future; In 1980 though, Deluxe in-
sists that “it was inevitable that it
would go on.” .

Despite the somewhat ephemeral
original concept, The Otters have
put a great deal of consideration in-

‘to their actand music.

For example, the group originally
picked--up a reputation as a covers
band of older Sixties material.
Deluxe emphasized that The Otters
wanted to “pick songs that our au-
dience or our age group (mid/late
20’s) are going to know,” i.e.
“Gloria” by Them or “So You
Wanna Be A Rock and Roll Star”
by The Byrds. On the other hand,
Deluxe pointed out that the band



- Eddie And The Otters: Fun And Music ForTodag

1‘

 

L-R: Eddie Townsend, Doug Deluxe, Mike Kolesar-, Jim Fish, Jimmy Ramone

...bringing people back into reality

i would “like to bring the audience

along” in getting acquainted with
less familiar old songs like “L1ttle
Girl” by The Syndicate of Sound,
or more recent new wave material
like “Sheena Is A Pimk Rocker” by
The Ramones. For Deluxe though,

dience, now that they have acquired
a following, it's possible to do some
things that a just-starting" band can’l'
do. The Otters now circulate lists ‘
of songs around the crowd as a
means of soliciting requests and
simply getting audiences more in-
volved in the fun. Deluxe also

the main consideration in choosing
material is “they’re going to_ be
songs that are danceable.”

The question of what The Otters
should be extends to what some
people consider minor questions,
like What t0 Wear f0? 8 gig; Out t0 own original songs, into the covers
vital considerations of crowd expec- that they've done in the past,
tati0h5- “Grand Larcency” for example,

The 03110 ‘V0010 like t0 C1litiV3te with others in preparation. Deluxe
S0h1ethihg 0f 3 1309 image ab011t described the creative process as
their act. For now, this means consisting of a “major writer and
shirts and ties, nothing pretentious, contﬁbutol-s_” For example, 
but Still 0001- “YOU d0h’t Want t0 Deluxe writes a song, Ramone will
look like you walked off the street heh, refine the music while Town-
With 3 guitars” °°mm°“t°d D°1“xe- send will help develop the lyrics. If
Getting 100Se is 0he thing. but it Ramone writes a song, the positions
d0eSh’t thee-h S10DDiness. are basically reversed. Quite simp-

M0Vi.hg 0h the The Otters’ 311- ly, song writing -is a group occupa-

tion.

Some of these labors are going to
bear vinyl fruit sometime in the
future. Carl Grefenstette, who
operates Pittsburgh Guitars, is
assembling an album of local talent,
and The Otters are‘ one of the bands 
to be included on this long overdue , 1 ‘E
project tentatively to be called Made
in Pittsburgh. The specific songs to A
be included are the original “Grand
Larcency” and the cover “Little
Girl.”

Now that The Otters consider
themselves more of an ongoing
operation, some things have remain-.
ed the same while other problems
have to be worried about. For
Townsend, the band is going-to re-
main “a release” for his frustra-
tions. —

“The hardest part of this band,
for me, is taking it too seriously,”
said Townsend. Townsend is very

I serious about groups who feel they
are “more than Pittsburgh musi-
cians,” serious in that he wouldn’t
want'The Otters to go the same ’

way‘. - ' «

wishes the people would feel free to 7
get up and get involved with-out be-
ing self-conscious. Kolesar put it
somewhat more bluntly, “fuck art, ,
let’s dance!” ’

The band is‘ also working their

The exotic, never-seen-before
theater of a story book country will
have its American premvere in Pitts-
burgh this weekend. Via the
Floating Theatre, the Royal Dancers
and Musicians from the Kingdom of
Bhutan will make their first ap-
pearance ever outside the tiny
Himalayan country at the Duquesne
Union Ballroom this Friday and
Saturday night.

“It is a very distinguished and im-
portant occasion,” said Leon Katz,
director of the Floating Theatre. In-
deed, it promises to be an outstan-
ding international theater event.

Bhutan is a semi-independent
state in the eastern Himalaya’s. It is

. bordered on the north-east and

north-west by Tibet, and on the
south and south’-west by Assam and
Sikkim. The entire country is
mountainous; its inhabitants are
Mongolians, and their religion is
Tibetan Buddhism.

There are 13 dancers and musi-
cians in the Bhutanese troupe. The
vignettes of the performance will be
enactments of stories from Buddhist
legend and Bhutanese folklore. The
dancers will wear colorful costumes
of silk and extraordinary masks
which represent dragons and
demons. The music is played on
drums, cymbalsand horns; some of
whch measure up to seven feet in

_ length.

I Intervals of comic pantomine are
also partof the performance. A
writer for National Geographic who

witnessed the performance in
_ Bhutan described the masked jesters

as being like side-stage clowns at a
circus chorus line as they parody the

‘dancer's symbolic movements.

One of the dances included in

_ the performance is “Shawo

Shachi.” It is about the famous
Buddhist yogi Melarepa who saves a

« frightened stag from a hunter and

his dogs. Melarepa then convinces
the hunter to pursue a better life.
Other dances include “Durdag”
(The Dance of the Cremation
Ground) which tells how evil spirits
are subdued and “Pholay Molay”
(Dance of the Noblemen and the
Ladies).

’ “It’s not frontally oriented like
Western ballet,” noted Katz.

_ “These are court dancers who nor-

mally perform with people on all
sides.” As a result, the perfor-
mance will be slightly modified to
accommodaet the proscenium stag-
ing. _
The’ Bhutanese troupe is schedul-
ed to arrive in Pittsburgh tomor-
row. They will be staying at the
William Penn Hotel downtown. On
Thursday, which Mayor Richard
Caliguiri has declared “Bhutan
Day,” the troupe will be given a
tour of the ‘city. '

The tour itinerary will include a
ride up the incline and visits to
Three Rivers Stadium, the Civic
Arena, Heinz Hall, the old Post Of-
fice and Buhl Planetarium on the
North Side and the Carnegie
Museum. Needless to say, the
group will go through- some measure.

of culture shock.

“I’m interested in seeing the in-
itial response and reaction of the
compar'1y'to art American city, and
an American city to the company,”
said Katz. '

Because the Bhutanese visit is so
unique and important, a ﬁlm
documentary will be made. It will
be produced by the University
Center for Instructional Resources
in cooperation with Learning
Systems Center of Robert Morris
College. Funding is being provided
by Pitt’s Office of Faculty Develop-
merit.

The site-seeing tour as well as the
actual performance will be included
in the film. There will also be inter-
views with Katz, members of the
Bhutanese company and special

It is certainly an honor for Pittsburgh to
host the American premiere of the Royal
Dancers and Musicians from the Kingdom
of Bhutan. It is also l_ucky that the city has
one of only three arts and crafts shops in
the United States which specializes in
Himalayan art.

As an added attraction at Friday and
Saturday nights performances, Himalayan
Kingdon, one of the Craig Street Shoppes,
will display over 40 items from the
Bhutanes region; however, all the pieces
will not be exclusively from Bhutan.

Alex Fazio and Helen-Jean Asquine, the
gallery owners, will display their collection
in an area directly adjacent to where the
Bhutanese troupe will perform. According
to Fazio, it will consist maily of textiles.
There will be Tibetan carpets and prayer
rugs, bronzes and jewelry, ceremonial
masks of wood and papier mache and scroll
paintings which are called ‘thankas.’

' “The pieces are very esoteri'c,”; said
Fazio. “Like the Royal Dancers and Musi-
cians, there is much symbolism in this art.

»Basically it is theirattempt to portray a

divine world.”

Fazio developed his appreciation and
knowledge of Himalayan art as a Peace
Corps volunteer in Nepal. He and Asquine

have returned frequently to the region to -

acquire more objects for their collection.
In fact, they’ll be returning there next
month. Fazio stressed that the objects are '
often difficult to acquire and that most of
the pieces in Himalayan Kingdom’s collec-
tion are very rare. He also noted that as a
result of this scarcity Himalayan art is one

of the least understood in the world.

The pieces on display at Duquesne will be
for sale.

Katz said that since the film is
not being done under any particular
auspices, the Floating Theatre will
have control of the film once it is
completed. He is not sure at this
point, however, _exactly when or
where it will.be shown.

The Bhutanese visit is being made _

possible through the Asian Society
Performing Arts Program in New
York. The society contracts with
various theatre groups in Asia and
their governments to arrange tours
in the United States. .

“The Asian Society has been very
cooperative with us,” said Katz,
“and they’re thrilled that we’re
making such a big opening of it.” p

Also involved in the project is the
Duquesne Union which is co-
sponsoring the event with the
Floating Theatre. _ More than last
fall’s production of the Theatre X’s-
“Schmaltz,“” which was co- .
sponsored with the Pitt Union Pro-
gram Coungil, this is part of Katz’s
design to increase the "visibility of
the Floating Theatre and make an
even larger contribution to the
culture of Pittsburgh.’

“This year we’ve been looking
for as much co-sponsorship in
events as possible,” explained Katz.

‘ “When weesponsor our own events
and do them in our own spacesthe

events usually require small au-
diences and so our visibility remains

_low._ But since we’re doing larger

events this year, and will continue
to do larger events, I thought that
the co-sponsorship would aid both
in the visibility of the Floating
Theatre and also our becoming
more a part of the cultural activities
in Pittsburgh. , _
“Without question this is the
most ambitious thing we’ve ever
done and thething with the widest
appeal,” concluded Katz. Last
summer at the 1979 annual con-
ference of the International Theatre
Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria, the
Floating Theatre was honored as
“an outstanding contributor to fur-
thering the avant-garde theater
movement in America.” The Royal.
Dancers and Musicians will certainly
be a spectacular example of this and
another important step in Pitts-

burgh’s blossoming sgtheater scene.

Endgame cast spends night after
night working on the classic.

Directing is Harris’ chief interest
in the theater. He was trained as a
director, and at one time, even '
taught acting. But with Endgame,
he is in the position that suits him
most comfortably.

The pounding of set construction
from the stage below is oppressive;
sharp cracks resounding through the
building, crushing out Harris’ voice.
His tone is light, optimistic. The
endeavor of Beckett and the chance

, to talk about it obviously please
him. ‘

I “It’s a hard script to talk about.
Alot of times I’ll be asked ques-
tions that I could make up a bogus
answer to and make it sound fine,
but it wouldn’t be...honest. A lot ,
of times I. don’t know the answer.
A lot of times the answer is
something-that I can’t put into
words.

it.”

is silence from the darkened stage as

chosen, the rest of the world seems
dead outside of the barren room;
windows too high to see out of
without a ladder, and a picture

Clov.’s. entrance is like an over-
ture, moving across stage, window

tween he and Hamm start", the play
feels like it transforms into a game.
Beckett’s play is almost like a
spoken musical; full chords and
darkened arpeggios. The play bet-
ween the actors is incredible, like a
cadence only occasionally syn- ‘‘

The performance runs. a" little over two
hours but Bayuk pointed out that Alden’s

script is so tightly written that it is hard to

cut any of it. Also, Bayuk sees no problem
with Wisniski self-directing the play. “Ron
loves to watch people,” said Bayuk, “he
picks up on subtle mannerisms and things
click in his mind. He’ll say ‘Yes, that’s the
way Roosevelt would have done it’ and he’ll
do it.”

sweeping, teen-age movement destined to
blow the lid off stiﬂing post World War II
Britain. Mod grew out of a backlash

towards the depressing, dead end, work-a-
week attitude that prevailed in England
during the early Sixties.‘

Like any rigorous peer pressure, Mod
demanded a strict adherence to the codes of
’ fashion. Wearing the right clothes was im-
portant, but so was listening to the right
records, driving the right scooter and gob-
bling the right kind and amount of pills.
One also had to hate Rockers—the greasy,

The story of Quadrophenia is told
through the eyes of Jimmy, a hard—nosed,

Cruising ’

Wipe away the steaming, ﬂeshylgay night -

perversion and try to get at the essence of 

‘Cruising a film written .and directed
William Friedkin. It is impossible.

A V Friedkin makes it clear at the very start of
the movie that his film is just a slice of the
deviant side of the homosexual world.
Manhattan. Not'Woody Allen. The.gays
rob the lights of ‘evening, soaking it up with
seas of black leather. It is a forest of gay
men, and Friedkin is there, taking us there,
even though it almost hurts to watch; lots
of ﬂesh, of sex, of cruising‘, of blood.

Somewhere, microscopically, there is a
psycopath blending in with the other grains‘
in black leather, turning knives in the backs
of other gays. Sometimes in this film,
Friedkin seems to be rolling his camera
sympathetically, showing us an injustice
Their world, unfor-
tunately, becomes one of death. Every time
that we are entered into it by the director,
someone dies violently.

Officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino) takes the

undercover assignment to fade into the gay -

world and look for the killer. It takes a bit
too long for Pacino to appear. Friedkin has
already twisted at our insides by this time,
and if the friendly face doesn’t appear
soon, he could,very'well lose us.

Now the time is crucial for Friedkin as
the director. He could have a bomb, a good
film; or a great film. The material is too ex-
plosive to do anything mediocre. ‘ But,
Friedkin takes the middle of the road. A
great homosexually explicit film has yet__to
be made._ Friedkin has just set the stage for

someone else, although he can be assured _

that Cruising will last. ' ' ' l 

 

somewhat

of the Mod crowd. The scenes with Daniels
and Sting together are some of the film’s
best.

But under the direction of Franc Rod-
dam, the cinematic interpretation differs
from Peter Townshend’s recorded version.
Where Townshend’s music, by its very pas-
sionate and angry nature was uplifting and
hopeful, the film dredges
through a frustrating, dreary discourse,
painful to an audience that has probably ex-

perienced a lifetime of much of the same.‘

There is no hope for this Jimmy as his com-
plete psychological destruction unfolds on
the screen.

It is difficult to receive the message.‘ In

T the end, the movie is an indictment of mis-
' pent youth in search of drugs, sex, annhilia-

tion and faded dreams.

On‘ a more positive note, director 'Rod-S

dam makes few compromises. Accuracy
and authenticity are his primary con-
cerns—from the vintage seersucker suits,
army" parkas and G.S. scooters to the thick
London_ slang—a1l combining to form a
very British effect, often a communication
block for the American audience.

But ultimately the anger, frustration and
passion shows through—something kids the
world over can identify with. O

Quadrgphenia does not glorify the Mods

f nor anything -they stand for. The violence,

sex, masturbation, profanity and teenage
lust, so much a common fact of everyday
life is dealt with truthfully and not exploited
for shock value. The story is told
straight—something The Who have done
with their music for the past 16 years. In

that sense it is a story that should have been

told long before this.

For the generation of today, final words
of advice: Don’t go to this film expecting to
see The Who or hear their music. But in-
stead go to see and hear a little piece of
yourself.

 ‘Cruising’   Fails To Finger The Proper Nerve

FILMS

Tuesday, Feb. 26: ‘Rashoman,’ Pittsburgh Playhouse. 7:30

Friedkin is a ‘story-teller, and an or-
chestrator of wonderful action scenes.

‘Cruising is a fine film, and mustbe seen.

The sad part is the potential it had’, but
never capitalized on.

With the advent of Pacino, Friedkin
would have woven a very psychological and
very harrowing tale. But instead of explor-
ing and rummaging through Pacino as the

heterosexual in a deviate world, Friedkin

just glazes over much of the character,_ leav-
ing Pacino without much to do. Only
through brief, cryptic conversations with‘
his girlfriend (Karen Allen) does the tor-
ment of the assignment come through.

Instead, Friedkin decides to comment on
the entire microcosm of that part of the gay
world. Sometimes it seems he’s trying to
say that injustice _after injusticewill occur,
despite how many cops infiltrate and hunt
down these psycopaths (which, Friedkin
very abstractly tells us, was not a’homo-
sexual at all). But at the end, ‘we want to
believe the effect to be much more than
Pacino’ or Friedkin are telling us.

The sets are beautifully bleak, looking
sometimes like those in “blue movies.” All’
have a grisly realism that lends ‘strong
credibility to Cruising. .

The problem ‘doesn’t lie in the film as a

finished product. Cruising is good. What .

it could have been, however, is a great film.
William Friedkin has opened the window.
Al Pacino is at his usual dark-faced best.

Fosse’s Mystical Soul
Done Up In ‘All That Jazz’ .

By STAN MOYER

All That Jazz
Directed by Bob Fosse

There’s something exciting about putting
on a show—the songs, the dances, the lights
a5C-i the audiences. Andy Hardy did it; and
it always seemed to pull the Little Rascals
out of a financial jam while at the same
time providing an outlet for their creative
energies. “We’ll put on a show!” were the

magic words; and after the spell was cast,

‘Coal Miners Daughter’ Gives

revolves around the theater.

the production began with a pulse and beat

that never stopped until the final perfor- '

mance.

The same feeling of excitement is con-
veyed right from the beginning of the film
All That Jazz, directed and co-written by
Bob Fosse. The lights are ﬂashing, the
dancers seem to ﬂy and the music is pound-
ing,. provoking the tingle of anticipation
that something great is about to happen
(and it does!). This force is present

. throughout the film; the action never stops,

moving from climax to climax.

This is the story of Joe» Gideon ‘(Roy
Scheider), a director and choreographer of
musicals who also has his hand in directing
a film. Gideon devotes most of his time to
the ‘rehearsal of his new play; his life
If only life.
could be one big musical. But it isn’t and
he must deal with the world which includes
business men, his ex-wife Audrey‘(Leland
Palmer), his daughter, Michele (Erzsebet

Foldi), and his present girlfriend Katie (Ann
Reinking). Women being important to
Gideon, he is constantly, through fantasies,
flirting with a mysterious lady in white-
called Angelique (Jessica Lange), who
represents Death. .

As the mounting pressure of rehearsal
and production problems take their toll on
Gideon, his body revolts in the form of a
heart attack and the fun,’ at least for the
viewer, shifts into high gear. While he is
unconscious his mind springs to action in-
an effort to make some sense of his life.
And of course, every thought includes a
song and dance, his entire thought process,
a Broadway musical production evoking
the extravaganzas of Busby Berkeley and
the Astaire and Rogers films. The charac-
ters of -his real life enter his fantasy world
singing and -dancing, attempting 'to per-
suade him to do whatever they think, is right
for him; an astounding and exhiliarating se-
quence. ' ,

For anyone who knows nothing of the
work and creativeness- involved in rehear-
sing and perfecting a dance number there is
a very interesting and revealing counterpart
in the film. As the barker at the circus said,
“Before your very eyes. . .,” we see a rough
idea transformed into one of the most emo-
tionally and sexually exciting scenes of the
film. Commenting on the finished, sensual
scene, one of the producers reluctantly
remarks, “There goes the family
audience.” ' '

Audience The, Shaft’

A Coal Miner's Daughter

Directed by Michael Apted

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

What do you get when you cross con-
tradiction with commonplace? The end
result isga hybrid of scowls and yawns. Un-
fortunately, Coal Minef’s Daughter leaves
its audience with such reactions, hardly
what. one would expect from an
autobiographical success story. _

Under the direction Michael Apted, the
film traces the life of -the “First Lady of
Loretta Lynn (Sissy

Spacek) from a naive, yet awkwardly
‘precocious fourteen-year-old to a troubled
woman in her thirties, suffering from the
calamities and the tension of an overzealous
career in the entertainment circuit. As the
story progresses, little attention is paid to

her developing personality because she,

seems to -be controlled by the strong-willed
character of Doolittle Lynn, her husband
(Tommy Lee Jones). Blindly pushed into
marriage at the ‘age of fifteen, she is
unknowing of herself and her future. She
falters at the irnost menial of household

.tasks ,and cannot even face her won

womanhood.- During the early stage of
heir marriage, which, oddly enough, starts
to become unglued on the wedding night,
Loretta is perpetually dominated by her
spouse, who is, at best, uncaring and
animalistic. '
Doolittle introduces Loretta’s home-spun

self-taught talent to the world of entertain: _

ment at a local bar. “She is magically ac-

cepted by all, almost as if it had been a fairy
tale, and Doolittle blatantly and absurdly
shifts all his self.-centered intentions -to the
developing ability of his wife. In this in-
terim phase between obscurity and fame,

»the two are at their most colorful and

  

vivacious. -Warm, deep-seated_ concern ex-
udes over all and the film shines.

Transitions in development of character
are absent and the audience feels like it has

been rushed through the pages of a photo ‘

album. Nothing is present but the exterior
shells ‘of personalities. A

Numerous tragedies bubble up from the
weak story line and are treated lightly. and
unfairly. ,Marriage debacles and drug pro-
blems pave the way irreparably to an
unemotional climax in which Loretta Lynn,
exhausted and disoriented, proclaims what
the film-goers have already figured out. The
audience in the picture is transfixed by her
feelings and her words. In the moviehouse
the effect is much less than powerful.

Spacek’s and Jones’ protrayal of Loretta
and Doolittle Lynn are adequate," but not
entirely satisfactory, even considering the

. banal screenplay: The ﬁlm is speckled with
cuteness which livens up the nearly fruitless .

venture into the seemingly routine life of a

celebrity. Spacek and occasionally Beverly

D’Angelo, who plays the late country singer

Patsy ‘Cline, sing all of the songs. Although

the vocals become a little jagged and airy at‘
times, the music is quite reasonable.

There are several key problems which
should be addressed to this film. To begin,
there is a harsh, unfeeling treatment of the
main characters. Spacek is cast as a small
girl who seems to be caught between naivete
and maturity. This combination is very un-
comfortable.

Captured in the well-filmed settings of
coal-mining country in Kentucky, Coal
Miner’s Daughter .ascends from the rustic
to the urban.‘ Correspondingly the lifestyles
evolve from the simple to the complex. But
somewhere within this basic construct, the
fabric of personalities struggling to achieve
an equilibrium with the environment is
hardly utilized. With such prevalent in-
justice to the characters, the film appears to
leave undergrourrd its most precious
reserves. ’

outstanding as the song-and-dance man,
Gideon. He conveys the pain and pleasure
that his character experiences with the push
anddrive required for such a role.

It’s no secret that this film_ is based on
Fosse’s own life; the idea is reminiscent of
Fellini’s 81/2, yet the originality and crea-
tiveness of Fosse transcends any com-
parison. This is his mind, the way this artist

a showcase for Redlich’s exceptional danc-

After an intermission, Redlich and com-

spotlight portraying a Christ-like figure.

dominance of harsh movement and a chant-

company’s tour de force and they displayed
a versatility of subject matter the earlier
dances belied, but reliance on flashy. prop

took the place of a focus. The dance seem-
ed incomplete.

“Traces,” a fast paced dance of Western
Americana closed the show on a strong
note. The prairie costumes, lively har-

Redlich and company at their best. The
dance took flight and gave the audience a
glimpse of the heights Redlich is capable of
attaining.

By CAMILLE WOLF

Described in New York magazine as “an
American gothic” and in Newsweek as a
“wild comic sizzle of unexpected events and
images,” the Pittsburgh Public Theater is

presently producing Sam Shepard’s Buried
Child.

Shepard, in Esquire (1980) stated, “I
wanted to write a play about a family.”

Pulitzer prize-winning Buried Child is the
search of a grandson for his identity, his
roots. Shepard takes the myth of the
American family and distorts the belief into
a farce.

The Whispers/Shalamar/
Lakeside/ Dynasty
Stanley Theatre
February 23,1980

By DAVID STUBBS

SOLAR (Sound Of Los
Records), brought their multi-group show
to the Stanley for two shows on Saturday.
Though the Whispers were the main event,

gfpbecause of their hot hit single “The Beat

\

A Goes On”; Lakeside proved to be the
outstanding act.

Lakeside came out with a powerful, col-
orful, and very well choreographed show
opening with the very funky and happy
“See You At The Party” from their latest
l.p., Rough Riders. “Giving Into Love,”
the ballad from the Shot of Love album,
was very well done if a bit long. Lakeside is
composed of a rhythm section with four
singers. “Giving Into Love” highlighted
the dynamic harmony of this band. The hit
“Pull My String” followed with some
good, clean musicianship and vocals, not to
mention that funky beat. _

Lakeside finished their four song set with
their first hit, ‘‘All The Way Live” always a
great song but even better in concert. All in
all it was the beat song of the entire show.

The vocal group Shalamar came‘ out
bright and ﬂashy, with their Big Fun band.
Shalamar did six numbers featuring the
joyful “In The Socket,” “Take Me To The
River,” and the popular hit “Second Time
Around.” Though Shalamar is only
average on record, they were quite good
live. “Take Me To The River,” from the

Angeles I

r Shines Very Brightly!-‘ or Pittsburgh   

Big Fun l.p. was a nice, easy moving funk
number about a man and his dream of a
beauty queen from Venus.

Shalamar’s syrupy ballad approach came
through best on the O Jays’ classic “Let Me
Make Love To You.” They closed their
short, yet well presented show, -with their
big hit from their first album Disco
Gardens/ Take That To The Bank.

As time ticked towards the entrance of
the main event; The Whispers, it was hard
to imagine how they could possibly top
Lakeside or Shalamar. In a matter of
minutes this Stanley audience found out.

The Whispers backup band started out
with a tight, instrumental version of the
Earth, Wind & Fire tune, “In The Stone.”
The Whispers entered on a cut down ver-
sion of “Whisper In Your Ear,” im-
mediately followed by their big hit “Olivia
(Lost and Turned Out).”They then ven-
turedinto a very corny version of “Planets
of Life,” a meaningless song about zodiac
signs. The Whispers spotlight five front-
men but only two sing; the others just do
steps, and look cue, and occasionally add
some harmonies.

The'Whispers ‘continued with two little _
" love ballads; “Lady” from their new album

The Whispers, and the delightfully smooth
“Let’s Go All The Way” from the
Headlights album. A

The highlight of’ the show was the
Whispers’ dedication to the late Donny
Hathaway “Song For Donny,” which was
performed with the utmost of class and pro-
fessionalism.

The concert ended, as expected, with a

lifeless performance of “The Beat Goes

On.”

The Whispers have had ups and downs in
their career, but,.their last three albums
Headlights, Whisper In Your Ear, and The
Whispers have had good success. However,
they performed only part‘ of a song from

their best album, (and a big Pittsburgh hit),
Whisper In Your Ear. The Whispers band
was tight and the group had a lot of
showmanship, but the people who enjoyed
the two shows will probably most remember

the short taste of the highly talented’,

Peter, Paul and Mary: Great Folks After Years

Peter, Paul and Mary
Stanley Theatre
February 15, 1980

By M.P. TOMEI

Peter, Paul and Mary’s performance at
the Stanley Theatre last Friday evening was
more than a nostalgic trip back into the
music of the ’60s. It was an intimate mon-
tage of familiar harmonies, warm-hearted
humor, along with new compositions ex-
pressing where they’ve been, where they
are, and where they’re headed.

Since their reunion a year-and-a-half ago,
this is the first time the folk trio had been to
Pittsburgh, and naturally some things have
changed. Peter Yarrow has lost most of his
hair, attributing it to “an outpouring of
sagacity.” Paul Stookey has broadened his

13 vocal repertoire to include a variety of

special sound effects such as ftrucks,
telephones and landslides. Mary Travers,
still lean and elegant, but no longer the

quiet and mysterious blonde, took charge
of the audience with a brief solo perfor-
mance. V _ _ I p _

' Genuinely displaying rn’utua‘l__affections,
it was clear they were happy to be back
together. Evidently the audience, with ages
ranging from 12 to 60, was happy too, auto-
matically clapping and singing along with
the opening song “If I Had A Hammer.”
The enthusiasm throughout the 23-song set
had no chance to fade as the trio soulfully

showered the crowd with everyone’s

favorite folk ballads.

But they didn’t stop there. Paul wrote a
newsong, “Survivor,” especially for their
reunion that reveals the concept of con-
tinuity which all three feel is essential for
success in their music and their lives. Also,
their view of the current nuclear power
issue was pronounced when they sang
“Power,” the theme song of the anti-
nuclear movement. - 

“Puff The Magic Dragon” was updated
with a new addition: “A dragon lives

The Mersey Beat Lives
In Detroit Via Romantics

BY SCOTT MOWRY -.

The Romantics _ . ‘
The Decade
February 7, 1979

O.K. So Detroit’s famous for Ted
Nugent, Bob Seger, Stevie Wonder, and
Motown.

But now it has given us The Romantics.

Like a fond, faraway memory, The
Romantics arrive with reworked AM and
Merseybeat music charged with a new life
ready to ring in the 80’s. Their songs are
punchy and poppish and their show is
pumped with gallons of energy that oozes
from their guitars, drums, and diminutive
frames. . I

Appearing at The Decade during this
month, The Romantics, a foursome of
leather and tie, cropped hair and skinny-as-
a-rail rockers, displayed an obvious affec-
tion for music made of hefty guitar chords,
surginging rhythms and romantic lyrics.

Their hour and a half set featured most of ’

the songs-from their debut disc as well as a
little bit of old and a little bit. of new,

The pace of. the 14-song set was furious
from the opening notes of “When I Look
Into Your Eyes.”

Rhythm guitarist Wally Palmer was a
strong and forecefulfrontman. He accen-
tuated his lead" vocals with bulging eyes,

glowing facial expressions and random

finger pointing.

"Lead guiatarist Mike Skill played as‘

thoughhis amplifier was plugged into shoes

rather than his Rickenbacher‘ while drum-

L mer J immy Marrinos kicked and pounded '
his kit so hard it seemed at any moment as if

it would leap off th riser. Rich Cole, like all

sturdy bassmen, was cool and controled in’ . 

his playing. - e .

Other highlights of the evenig included
“What I Like About You,” with its ex-
hilarating chants of “hey(!),” -the syrupy
“Tell It To Carrie,” and the rousing“I(eep
In Touch.”  ,

Unfortunately, perhaps due to a shrill
sound system or an unfamiliarity iwth the
band’s material (even though they were.
makingan unprecedented fourth ap-
pearance at The Decade), this Thursday
night crow never let themselves -be taken
away by The Romantics.

Throughout theevening, The Romantics
pleaded with this Pittsburgh audience to
rise out of their seats and dance; a reception
the.band is probably accustomed to in their
hometown but which was next to impossi-
ble in the packed and sweaty Decade. When
encore time rolled around, the sound crew
had to practically beg the audience to invite
T/he Romatics back again with the words of
encoragement, “come on Pittsburgh, don’t
you want to party?” .

The Romantics must have wanted to play-
badly because the came back despite a less

than overwhelming response and churned 3

throuh versions of The Beatles’ “And Your
Bird Can Sing” and The‘ Rolling Stones’
“Last Time.” . ‘
After the show, Palmer said it best.
“Those people who don’t see us are missing
a good 50% of what we’re about,” he said.
Palmer was right. Judging by their reac-
tion on this night, Pittsburgh just hasn’t
realized what a good thing the romantics
are.  A .

THE PRETENDERS
The Pretenders
Sire '

SCOTT MOWRY

Pretend for a moment that all the
Foreigners, Bostons, Kansases, Molly Hat-
chets and Styxs took an extened holiday
from our radios and record stores.

Now pretend that an unknown British

S quartet armed with a debut album packed

with pop masterpieces arrived on the scene
(before you thought all was lost.

Now, believe it will happen.

Well, maybe the Foreigners, et al won’t
be going away but damned if The
Pretenders don’t start making some heads
spin, real soon.

Quite simply, The Pretenders are pop vir-
tuosists. Brilliant arrangements, senuous

‘vocals, articulate lyrics and contagious

hooks are their musical banners that are
sure to grab hold of the American airwaves
in the ’80’s.

On the basis of three enormously suc-
cessful singles and the photogenic face of
leader Chrissie Hynde, The Pretenders have
already latched onto the British charts with

a strong foothold into the new decade.

“Stop Your Sobbing,’’ ‘ “Kid,” and
“Brass In Pocket” were some of the finest

45's to emerge in the U.K. in 1979 and are

included on this album. The remainder of
the record does not quite live up to those
aforementioned tunes because they are just
that good.

Produced by the ever present studio
magician Nick Lowe, “Stop Your
Sobbing,” is so unique,m so intricate yet so
accessible, it's just too hard to believe that
Ray Davies wrote the thing back in the early
days of The Kinks. Lowe, Hynde and
friends do a magnificent job of moderniz-
ing the tune.

“Kid” is perhaps the album’s best. As a
vintage ’60’s rave-up with shimmering vocal
harmonies, it isa kind of Blondie meets The
Ventures style. “Kid” serves as a signpost
for the entire album that relys on an ac-
cumulation and assimilation of many styles.
Hynde has done her homework well.

“Brass In Pocket” displays some
dynamic lyrics. '

The remainder of the album drifts from a J‘ ‘

Beatlesque instrumental (“Space Invader,”

to hard driving sleaze, “Precious,” to sen-.
timentle reggae, “Private Life.”

— The Pretenders: Set To Talse On America A

The Pretenders, L-R: Pete Farndom, Chrissie Hynde, Martin Chambers, James Honeyman Scott

Akron exile -Hynde, (once amember of a
band that ‘included Devo’s Mark
Mothersbaugh), can compose, croon, play
and postue with the best of ‘em. She looks
delicious on the album but sounds even‘
sweeter on the inside. She is able to move
adeptly through a wide range of stylistic
singing from Deborah Harry to Lene
Lovich to Patti Smith. Hynde also handles
a wide range of emotions with intelligence,
and sensitivity.-

The same cannot be said of the rest of the ,

group—James Honeyman Scott on guitars
and keyboards, Pete Farndon on bass and
Martin Chambers on drums have some cat-
ching up do to the abilities of Hynde.

But all in all, these Pretenders are no
fakes. Watch out for them.

Warner Bros. 4
Prince’s second album takes over

where the first one left off. Most

of the tunes are worth a listen, once

again, Prince plays all instruments

(keyboards, guitars, basses, drums,

and percussion) along with all

vocals, composing, arranging, and ‘

producing. ‘At 18, Prince became
the youngest artist to produce his
own album with his debut, Prince
For You.

All of the tunes on Prince have
something to do with sex. Prince -
uses a very light falsetto on all tune

and at times can become somewhat '

monotonous but it maintains a good
melodic quality. “I Wanna Be

Your Lover,” “Why You Treat Me .

So Bad,” and “Sexy Dancer” are
the dance numbers. The keyboard
work and arranging of “I Wanna
Be Your Lover” is more than ade-”
quate while the guitar work‘ on
“Why You Treat Me So Bad” is
right on target. ‘
‘The mellow tunes on the album

areialso interesting. “When We're

Dancing Close And Slow” is boring
and possibly too laid back (chances
are you’ll skip it more than you’ll
play it). “With You” and “Still
Waiting” are gentle ballads that
sound the yearnings of a love-sick
virgin.

Perhaps the highlight of Prince is
the almost hard rock—sounding
“Bambi.” The tune concerns a
man with a bisexual girl friend who
can’t understand why she likes
women as much or even more than
him._ The rhythm arrangement is

once again flawless and his guitar
work isn’t shabby either.

Prince, to say the least, has a
great talent. Hopefully, as he gets
older perhaps, he will let go of his
overused falsetto and really sing.
There is little else anyone could find
wrong with this album musically.
But hopefully Prince won’t remain
so centered around sex. As we’ve
seen with music stars in the past,
too much sex (even in thought) can
either space one or burn one out.
Either would be a waste of a truly
promising talent named Prince.

COUNTRY JOE MCDONALD
. Country Joe McDonald
Fantasy

Ina somewhat innocuous effort,
Country Joe McDonald has released
, an album which should forever in-

. grain his name in the annals of
musical obscurity. The untitled
work, complete with a warning
about the possible unsuitability of
the song “La Di Da” for airplay,
scrapes away at the listener’s pa-
tience and tests his tolerance for
useless noise. With such titles as
“Private Parts,” “Sure Cure for
the Blues,” and “Hard Work and
No Play,” it is difficult to decipher V
what, if anything, McDonald is try-

‘ ing to say.

McDonald, probably most
famous for his “F.I.S.H.” cheer on
the Woodstock.album, and a leader
of that infamous West Coast
Politico-rock outﬁt, Country Joe
and The Fish, is also a self-
proclaimed advocate of the young
people of this country. Never one
to mince his words on matter he
seems socially important, Country
Joe strikes out once again in an
almost punk tenacity at everything
that gives him rise. In some circles
McDonald is considered a rare com-

The only saving point on the en-
tire album is the cut titled, “Do
Wop Oh.” The song itself 1S
nothing to write home about but
the execution of it is delightfully
different. The Persuasions accom-

acoustic harmonies of the fifties.
But it is doubtful that they will in-

PEARL HARBOR AND THE
EXPLOSIONS

Pearl Harbor and the Explosions
Warner Brothers

Pearl E. Gates, Peter Bilt, Hilary
and John Stench—c’mon now.
They are from San Francisco and
that means something to we who
are shot 11’ beer, card-carrying Pitts-
burghers, but give them a break.
Pearl Harbor and the Explosions
offers one song on their same _name
debut that demands a listen by
merit of its title: “Shut Up and
Dance.”

Ladies, if you are up to your
pelvis in lines on the dance ﬂoor,
next time take a tip from Pearl E.
“Is he gonna wanna hip ya to the
slip slide?/Is he gonna wanna make
you take the big ride?/Oh no, you
just tell him girl—Shut Up and
Dance!/ Shout it to him/Shut Up
and Dance!”

Pearl Harbor and the’ Explosions’
first LP should be received much
like Blondie’s. Their early styles are
not that dissimilar. The musician-
ship is very good, they use plenty.of
twists in rhythms and chords and
their attitude is a bit too aloof and
cynical. ‘There is room for improve:
ment and the band appears equal to
the challenge. Even though "this
album has no hits, there is evidence
of hard work. But, the release pro-
bably will go unnoticed.

With the price of petroleum pro-
ducts today and the closed playlists
on the radio you may get a rare
chance to hear Pearl Harbor and
the Explosions. But, if the band
stays together and keeps the effort
going, their next album may sneak
up on us all. ' .

Songs on the‘ album include:

“Get a Grip on Yourself,”, a
danceable “Rattlesnake Shake”
(shake it but don’t break it), “The
Big One,” a not particularly earth-
shaking song about California’s in-
evitable demise and “Drivin,’ ” the
LP’s opener and a good place to

recently though, Kaukonen has

Jorma is comparable to
Kaukonen’s first solo album, Quah,
an exercise that set the stage for ,
Hot Tuna. Like Quah, Kaukonen’s
new release is essentially a guitar
display, and quite a show it_is. The
tunes are either country blues
numbers like “Too Long Out/Too
Long In” or upbeat folk ballads
like “Roads and Roads,” which is ,
the best song on the album. All the
instrumentation is acoustic guitar
backed by an electric guitar, which
is more than enough for a fine
display of musicianship.

a

artistic fantasy number called

reached the_United States. Tzuke
paid her dues in the tough British
pop market and this album shows
she has acquired a great deal of
maturity and versatility.

“Stay With Me ’Til Dawn,”
includes pop tunes such as.
“Welcome To The Cruise,”
“Ladies Night-,” “Surkarita” and
the tender “Bring The Rain.”

Tzuke’s first British hit, ‘ ‘These
Are The Laws,” is on this album as
well which demonstrates the
strength of her voice over a rough
and funky rhythm section.

This album contains at least three
standout tunes. One is a light, very

“Katiera Island.” The vocal
phrasing of this song, as well as the
arrangement, are very good.
Saxophonist Ray W arleigh adds a
nice touch to the tune as well. “For
You" is the real gem, where
Tzuke’s voice is overdubbed about
four times on three part song. It’s
the type of,tune that is hard to
forget. “New Friends Again” is a
iunky tune complete with ﬂashy
rhythm and horn arrangements.

All of the songs are co-written by-
Tzuke and British pianist, Mike
Paxman, a tandem that has been
together since 1976.

Tzuke has recorded a fine album.

It’s a shame it took so long to get

to the U.S. “Stay With Me ’Til
Dawn” was released here in
November but has not seen a strong
promotion. Of the ten tunes on this
album only two don.’t match the
quality of the rest of the L.P.,
“Welcome To The Cruise” and
“Stay With Me ’Til Dawn”.
Hopefully, Americans‘ will discover
Tzuke and her music in the very
near future.

Detroit Rock
Rides Again

THE ROMANTICS

The Romantics
Nemperor

Rock n’ roll walks the wire bet-
ween love and desire. It is C
precariously balanced, leaning to
one side when the pressure of the
other threatens to send everything
head over heels into the oblivion of
the passe.

The Beatles and The Rolling
Stones maintained the equilibrium
for years. The early Eagles,
Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell and
sundry others kept the keel even
when the ballast of The Who and ‘
Led Zepplin caused a list.

Now it is 1980, and how do you
counter the fever of The Knack’s
lock -yourself in -the bathroom lyrics,
heavy breathing, and pubescent
mentality? Prescribed is a full dose
of The Romantics.

It is safe for pop-ular consump-
tion andthe ingredients are non-
carcinogenic (they're pre-tested).
However, the Romantics self-titled
debut may=be habit forming. Their
music is uncluttered, light‘, practical,
and for the unsuspecting—powerful
and exciting. 

The ﬂames of the British Invasion
are rekindled by these four musi-
cians from Detroit. You can hear
The Dave Clark Five in “Tell it to
Carrie,” Meet The Beatles in “Keep
in Touch” and The Kinks in “Girl
Next Door.” The Romantics are
not a band with an ability to clever-
ly copy other styles. The Mersey in-
ﬂuence is genuine and they build
upon it. Like the automobile
manufacturers, the above com-
parisons are just for the purpose of
comparison. What you hear
depends on your music habits and
inﬂuences. .

The Romantics have refined the
sixties sound. Instead of iron, they
use alloy; rough edges are smooth
now; and the muddy recordings
now have digital accuracy. It is not '
the sixties but the 1980s. History
repeats itself. The model is new
and improved.

ADVENTURE IN UTOPIA

Todd Rundgren and Utopia
Bearsville

.It often seems that recording his
own music is nothing more than a
favorite hobby for Todd Rundgren.
The Philadelphia native more often
produces and engineers other
peoples music; Patti Smith, The
Tom Robinson Band and Meat
Loaf, for example.

Yet even though they are few and
far between, Utopia albums are
usually something to be reckoned

with and Adventures In Utopia is
no exception. The album is current-
ly on the “Billboard” charts and
several cuts have been receiving
airplay in the Pittsburgh area.

f‘The Road To Utopia,” which
has anupbeat mixture of syn-
thesizers and guitar, .has received
the most airplay. Like most of the
songs on the album, this song is
about physicaland metaphysical
travel.

Another such song is “Caravan.”
Two thirds of the tune is musically
repititious and boring; however, the
ending ﬁnally, takes the listener off
somewhere with nice guitar ‘work.

Perhaps Adventure In Utopia’s
best song is “Last Of the New
Wave Riders.” It is a strong rocker
in which Rundgren and Company
“hit the supreme overload and the
great ampliﬁer began to explode/the
smoke is slowly clearing away/and
the whole universe is a ‘giant
guitar.”

Rundgren is backed by Roger
Powell, John Wilcox and Kasim
Sultan. All the songs which appear
on Adventures In Utopia were
originally performed for the Utopia
Video Television Production in Los
Angeles last summer. Naturally,
the album is produced and '
engineered by Rundgren.

Worth listening to someone else’s

copy.

Penetration’s
Lost Chance

COMING UP FOR AIR
Penetration

Virgin International

With the coming of the New
Wave in the US. and the British
Isles, there has been a galaxy of
new bands on the horizon. While a
fair number of these bands have
been successful, and some
shouldn’t have had the petrochemi-
cals wasted on them, many of these
groups just haven’t gotten a fair
shot. This is particularly true of
British bands trying ‘to make it in
this country. .

Penetration brought punkish
energy and “progressive” musical
elements together, and their second
album carries on that trend. What
is different, is that Pauline
Murray's lyrics have taken on a

’ darker tint on titles like ‘ ‘She Is The
Slave” and “Challenge” while
retaining the attitude of solidarity
that inspires the opening cut of the
album, ‘ ‘Shout Above The Noise. ”
This goes hand in hand with denser
arrangements and improved vocals
from Murray.

This is a crew that could
challenge Cheap Trick on their own
turf anyday of the week. What are
they doing now you may ask? They
have broken up from lack of support
and understanding.

They deserved better.

EXTENSIONS
Manhattan Transfer
Atlantic‘

This jazzy quartet has come a
long way from the days of their
CBS summer replacement show,
when theyjfirst offered their wares

?.;tQ".‘,o_ldies” buffs and- sentimen- ~

. talists. Today,‘ they offer an album
dedicated to Pittsburgh's own Eddie
Jefferson (1919-19.79). _

Extensions is an admirable effort,
Which seen in the light of being a

"novelty, for‘ the most part, is a good
album. Their decent commemora-
tion of Jefferson’s skill on “Body
and Soul" is “very/pleasing/to-the
ear'9! .

It can’t be seen as an overpower-
ing, innovative recording overall.
The exception is the enthusiastic
and exciting vocal rendition of
Weather Report’s most popular
crossover hit “Birdland.” It took
guts, and a great deal of talent to
pull off a successful take of
“Birdland” and here, Janis Siegel,
Alan Paul, Cheryl Bentyne, and

Tim Hauser shine.

With the support from Earth,
Wind & Fire associate Jay Graydon,
and veteran jazz singer/lyricist Jon
Hendricks, the disco, pop, and jazz
appeals on Extensions are a
delightful surprise. “Twilight
Zone/ Twilight Tone, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Nothing
You Can Do About It,” and
“Wacky Dust” are some
examples.

Extensions is a potpourri of
American music, snatching from .the
early days of the 30s and 405 radio
music shows to the doo-wopping

50s (“Trickle, Trickle”) to the

glowing a capella ballads of recent ‘I

composers (Tom Waits’ “Foreign
Affair”) and the perky vocal ,
representation of Sypro Grya’s ’78 ,
instrumental, “Shaker Song.” A
The album is a slickly produced
work which many will like, if only
given the chance to hear it. As a
vocal group, Manhattan Transfer
still has a long way to go, but if Ex-
tensions is any indication of where ‘
they’re going, the groupis definitely
headed onward and upward in the

hear-like the powerchords and everything,

‘that’s Jimi. And it’s loosely based on
