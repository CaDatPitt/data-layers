new housing

Pitt’s in trouble with the
Oakland community again and the
issue is familiar: student housing.

But Pitt had responses for resi-
dents’ concems with the school’s
expansion.

More than 70 people attended
yesterday’s public meeting of the
City Planning Commission, many of
whom were there to protest Pitt’s lat-
est plans to ﬁnd student housing.

ommend the zoning board grant Pitt
permission to build a 64-student gar-
den—style apartment complex on
Oakland Avenue.

The Commission ultimately
tabled the issue for two weeks, «while
it considers input from both Pitt and
community members.

“What’s going on is that they’re
going forward with some housing
projects that I think most people
agree are going to be detrimental to
the community,” said Marshall
Goodwin, president of the Oakland

 
 

 

Among other issues, the commis-
sion met to decide whether to rec-

Cyclists, in-line skaters
take over Schenley
Park road on weekends

Shira Selkovits
For The Pitt News

With the the in—line skating craze sweeping
the nation, many cities offer safe trails and
streets for skating and other recreational activi-
ties. z
In New York City and Boston, parts of main
streets are open for skaters and cyclists but
closed to cars and buses. Every year, Georgia
closes roads to host an 86-mile in—line skate race
from Athens to Atlanta. T

Now Pittsburgh is getting in on the act, with
an announcement from city officials that Circuit
Road in Schenley Park will be closed during
summer weekends. -

Circuit Road will be closed to both driving
and parking every weekend from 6 p.m. Friday to
6 a.m. Monday. The /only exception will be the
weekend of July 17-19, during the Annual
Schenley Park Vintage Grand Prix.

This year there have been two local 5—kilo-
meter skate races as well as weekly organized
street skates. A paved trail along the Parkway
East for skating and cycling. has also been
added.

Local skaters have been quick to seize the
new opportunities.

“I used to ride on Fifth Avenue, but this is
much more safe,” said in—line skater Jennie  P ‘   "  -
Speer, a Pitt junior. “I don’t have to worry about Circuit Road in Schenley Park closes on weekends
2 during ihe summer for cycling and in-line skating.

Police blame alcohol
for State College riot

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (U—Wire)
—— Bonfires fueled by furniture, street
lights and trees lit the darkened street,
and objects were thrown from the bal-
conies of apartment buildings when
bar patrons rioted after bars closed
early Sunday morning.

Thousands of people watched or
participated in the riot, which began at
about 1:30 a.m. and lasted for about
two hours, according to a press release
from the State College Police
Department. Police began to disperse
the crowd at’ about 4 a.m. State
College Police Chief Tom King said
alcohol played a significant role in the
I°i0t'.

Eighteen people were arrested for
failure to disperse upon lawful order
and disorderly conduct, according to
the press release. Two others were
charged with resisting arrest, in addi-
tion to failure to disperse upon lawful
order and disorderly conduct, accord-
ing to the press release.

Of the 20 people arrested, 11 were‘

Penn State students, said Lt. Diane
Conrad of State
College police. More

to the list, Conrad
said, and additional
arrests may also be
made.

Two people were ‘treated for
injuries —— one was hit on the head by
a falling object and another was
burned, Conrad said. Others received
minor injuries during the riot,

~ although State College police were not
A sure of the exact number.

About 16 police officers were
treated for minor injuries, State
College police said. Three officers
were taken to Centre Community
Hospital and treated for injuries,
which included a fractured wrist, cuts
and a broken thumb.

Property damage included the
destruction of parking meters, street
signs, parked vehicles and 33 street

lights, Conrad said. In addition, the
windows of three businesses were bro-
ken. Police estimated the damage was
at least $50,000.

State College police were assisted
by the Pennsylvania State Police,
University Police Services, Ferguson,
Patton and Spring Township police
and Bellefonte police, with total police
officers at about 125.

The riot began after someone
threw a party ball out of an apartment

_window that faced Beaver Avenue,

said many students at the scene.
People then gathered in the street and
kicked the ball around. However, King
said the riot began when a garbage can
was kicked around on the street.

Either way, the crowd swelled’

from about 150 to about 1,500 people,
and individuals rocked the street lights
back and forth,'tearing them down and
throwing garbage cans, toilet paper,
kegs and ﬁrecrackers.

“I’ve been here for ﬁve years, and
this is the most bizarre thing I have
ever seen ——- ever,” said senior John
Noll as he watched
the crowd gather
around the largest fire.
“I don’t know what to
think? I’m a little
shell-shocked.”

Participants tossed many of the
street lights, couches, their own cloth-
ing and any other available ﬂammable
objects, including a derby car from Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity, 234 E. Beaver
Ave. The combination of the fuels cre-
ated thick black smoke, fumes and
coughing bystanders. A

Participants also danced around
the fire — some without shirts and at
least one with no pants.

Nathan Deck took advantage of
the ﬂames and attempted to satisfy his
hunger by toasting hot dogs on sticks.

“It’s a bonfire,” Deck said. “We
wanted to be original. They’re throw-
ing lamp posts, we’re roasting hot
dogs.”

being hit by a car or keeping with the
ﬂow of traffic. And the scenery is
nicer, too.”

Randy Knapick, a city transporta-
tion planner, said the city will contin-
ue the program as long as the
response is positive.

He said he and other city planners
determined Circuit Road to be the

most appropriate street to close

because of its accessibility to
Oakland residents and its varied

light enough so the city can close it

said. .

Several other major cities ‘have

Vancouver, British Columbia, and

ging every Sunday morning.

Pitt professor
receives

honorary degree in
Finland

The University of Vaasa in Finland
has awarded a Pitt political science pro-
fessor an honorary doctorate in
Administrative Sciences.

The university gave B. Guy Peters
the award based on his work in the ﬁeld of
public policy. Peters’ research has empha-
sized comparison of how countries’ pub-
lic administrations operate.

_ Peters, a Squirrel Hill resident, trav-
eled to Finland to receive the award. The
University of Vaasa also presented him
with a sword and hat to commemorate the
occasion.

Finnish Universities hold such cere-
monies every ﬁve or 10 years.

Peters has
worked as a consul-
tant for a wide range
of governments
around the world,
including Australia,
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and in
the United States, the city of New
Orleans.

He has also written and co-authored
14 books, the ﬁrst of which, “The Politics
of Bureaucracy,” has become one of the
standard texts in comparative public
administration, according to Pitt spokes-
woman Patricia Lomando White.

Peters’ books have been translated
into a host of languages, including
Spanish, French, Italian and Indonesian.

Every summer Peters serves as a vis-
iting researcher at Nuﬂield College at
Oxford University. He has also held posts
in Stockholm, Zurich and Manchester.

Peters’ cmrent research is directed

trative structures and procedures for the .

emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.

physical abilities, while motor deﬁcits
affect such abilities as speech and mem-
ory.

According to the National Institutes
of Health, stroke is the third leading
cause of death and the most common
cause of adult disability in the United
States. More than 700,000 Americans
suffer a stroke each year, of which 30
percent die and 20 percent to 30 percent
suffer a permanent disability. The
remaining victims recover.

The United States spends $41.9 bil-
lion each year to treat stroke victims.

In the past, rehabilitation through
physical and occupational therapy has
been the only way to treat stroke victims.
There currently are no recognized ways
to safely and effectively treat the neuro-
logical damage of a stroke.

UPMC researchers are hoping to
change that.

"This trial opens the door to fuller

recovery from stroke,” said Dr. Douglas
Kondziolka, who developed the study.
“While physical and occupational «thera-
py helps many patients adapt to the dam-
age their brain has suffered from stroke,
neuron cell transplantation may allow
patients to recover lost abilities.”

Researchers have used fetal human‘

and fetal animal cell transplants in the
past to attack neurodegenerative diseases
such as Parkinson’s disease. The UPMC
study is the ﬁrst to use cell transplants to
speciﬁcally address stroke.

By using laboratory-grown tissue,
UPMC researchers will be able to side-
step a controversial issue raised by the
past experiments.

“Use of manufactured
cells...removes the ethical concerns
many people have about the use of fetal
tissue,” said Dr. Peter J armetta, chairman
emeritus of the UPMC Department of
Neurological Surgery.

Community Council regarding the South
Oakland complex.

Goodwin and other community mem-
bers argued that the apartrnent building —
and another, larger complex to be built in the
future —— would damage the Oakland com-
munity for a variety of reasons, including the
fact that the apartments would not be on carn-
pus and would put more students in the com-
munity.

“I’m talking about animals here,” said
Oakland resident Jim Lally. “[The movie]
‘Animal House’ had nothing on these guys.”

Helen Schlonke of the Belleﬁeld Area
Citizens Association, which represents peo-
ple living on Belleﬁeld Avenue and
Dithridge, Craig and Neville Streets, said stu-
dents and the elderly cannot coexist

“The” undergraduate lifestyle ‘doesn’t
match the lifestyles of older people who live
in the condominiums and developments in
the Belleﬁeld area,” she said.

Other Oakland residents complained of
vandalism, loud music and public drunke-
ness.
Jerome Cochran, assistant chancellor of
Business and Administration, countered the
citizens’ arguments.

He pointed to ,a list of initiatives Pitt has
undertaken in recent years to help students
and community residents live in harmony.

- In the last 10 years, the University has
increased the size and jurisdiction of the Pitt
Police force. There are now 80 officers
patrolling the Oakland area.

0 The University has enacted a program
called “Pitt Promise,” which encourages
civility and cooperation among students.

0 Pitt has begun measures to bring frater-
nities back onto campus and to crack down
on those who violate alcohol and controlled
substance rules.

- The University has entered into a con-
tract with Port Authority Transit to let stu-
dents ride buses and mass transit vehicles
anywhere in Allegheny County, ﬁnanced by
an increase in students’ fees. Cochran said
this helps to reduce the number of cars tra-
versing Oakland streets.

In defense of Pitt students, Cochran said,
“You don’t pick up a newspaper and read,
like you do in State College, Pa., that there
was ariotafteran arts festiv .” _

From the back of the Planning
Commission chambers, Lally retorted by
yelling, “You live with them!”

He then demanded to know where
Cochran lives —— in Shaler Township in the
North Hills. Cochran’s son, a Pitt sophomore,
lives on Oakland Avenue.

Goodwin and community members are
also concerned with the size of the proposed
apartment complex. It will be four stories tall,

FROM PAGE 1

r

while the majority of the houses in South 
Oakland rise two or three. Some residents 
expressed concern that the complex would 
block sunlight to their homes or interrupt the 
continuity of the roof lines in their neighbor- 

hoods.

Oakland residents are also concerned 
about parking. Future additions to the apa1t— 3-

ment complex will be built on an existing 
parking lot, and the University has no plans to 

build a new lot nearby.

Ana Guzman, associate vice chancellor 
of Facilities Management, said Pitt plans to -

offer parking spaces in the Tower View
garage and eventually in Panther Hollow.

To coincide with the construction of the
apartment complex in South Oakland, Pitt
hopes to convert existing buildings into stu-
dent housing. The Forbes-Craig building at
the comer of Forbes Avenue and South Craig

Street would be used to house 100 under— .

graduate honors college students. Pitt wants
to convert the Mayﬂower building on North
Dithridge Street into a residence for graduate
students.

The problem, community residents said,
is that Pitt should use existing space on cam-
pus rather than spreading out into surround-
ing communities.

Several community members suggested

‘ that Pitt convert Pemrsylvania Hall, near Pitt

Stadium, into a residence hall, rather’ than
demolish it as planned.

‘The University of Pittsburgh I think
ought to be able to demonstrate...given [its]
vast amount of supposed brain power...tl1at
this building cannot be converted to another
use,” said resident John Murdoch “I think it’s
interesting that at a time when tl1ey’re virtual-
ly desperate for housing, this building cannot
be converted for housing.”

Pitt can’t stop spreading into the com-
munity if it isn’t allowed to clear space on
campus, Cochran said. He and Guzman both
said Pennsylvania Hall, is not suitable for con-
version into dorms because cracks are
appearing in its facade, and because the build-
ing’s interior layout isn’t conducive to such a
project

What’s more, Cochran said, students liv-
ing in the Forbes-Craig building will be hon-
ors college students who must have a num-
mum SA'I‘ score of 1,300 and a minimum
QPA of 3.25. Such students, he said, are not
destructive — they are vastly more interested
in learning.

What is ultimately important, said
Robert Pack, vice provost of Academic
Planning and Resource Management, is that
the University wants to be friends with com-
munity members.

“Ihe University seeks engagement with
the community, not isolation from it,” he said.

The Pitt News is seeking writers for every
section, photographers, proofreaders,
cartoonists and business staff for the fall.

Pitt’s expansion oes not
  threaten Oakland

Residents from the Oakland
Community Council and the
Belleﬁeld Area Residents
Association are angry with Pitt’s
decision to build extra housing in
Oakland. Three particular projects
anger them: the garden-style apart-
ment complex in South Oakland,
proposed housing for Honors
College undergraduates and gradu-
ate student apartments in North
Oakland.

While Pitt’s housing plans
have been somewhat awkward of
late (what happened to the pro-
posed complex on Fifth Avenue
between Oakland Avenue and
Bouquet Street?), the OCC and
BARA are being petty and unrea-
sonable.

Pitt needs housing for its stu-
dents — desperately. Where would
these “concerned” residents like
students to live?

The OCC complains about the
whopping four-story height of the
garden-style apartment complex,
never mind tlmt it will only hold 64
people, which does not signiﬁcant-
ly help Pitt’s problem with over-
crowding. Would the size of this
complex, which is the sarrre height
as Hillman Library, ruin the spec-
tacular view and ambience of
South Oakland? _

In attempting to make their
point, residents stereotyped Pitt’s

students as troublemakers and van-
dals. Those graduate students in the
Mayﬂower Building are bound to
be trouble. Teaching recitations and
researching for dissertations would
obviously lead a graduate student
to wild and rowdy behavior.

These residents should realize
that without the University of
Pittsburgh, South Oakland would
be another Wlkinsburg. Pitt is the
reason why the crime of the Hill
district hasn’t spilled over into
Oakland. Surely they’d prefer stu-
dents to gangs and prostitutes, and
university buildings to bullet-rid-
den projects. W"rth Pitt comes a
Police force and the spending
power of over 20,000 students.

Instead of decrying Pitt’s
efforts to build student housing,
Oakland should be thanking them.
Among other things, slumlords
will have to improve the living
standards in their buildings to be
able to compete with University
housing.

The community has com-
plained about the lack of housing
for years. Pitt is addressing that
problem, albeit differently than
originally planned. What does the
Oakland community want?

Pitt needs more housing, and
Oakland needs Pitt’s students. It’s a
pity that some people just don’t get
it. .

to freedom for from over

When Nelson Mandela celebrates his
80th birthday on July 18, millions will
congratulate him and salute his many
achievement-s. To have come from
Robben Island ‘prison (where I broke
stones with him in the ‘60s), where he
spent twenty-seven years, to president of
South Africa, and to steer the country
since 1994 from its horrific past of
apartheid is indeed an achievement. It has
been called a “miracle,” and has been
universally applauded (the Guggenheim
magazine pointed out:
“the biggest miracle: no
foreign corporations were
ousted.”).

But while the ‘con-
gratulations pour in, anx-
ious questions are being
asked: after Mandela,
what? He will step down
as president in 1999,
when fresh elections are
held, and has already
stepped down as presi-
dent of the African
National Congress. He
has designated Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki
(already President of the
ANC) as his successor,
but this will be decided at
the elections.

The ANC is likely to
be returned at the elections, but probably
by a reduced majority — unemployment,
rising crime and residual race hostilities
will be strong factors. Probably the one
dominant dissatisfaction is un-met expec-
tations. I was appalled to see the increase
in the number of beggars in
Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town
last month.

Mandela has made tremendous
efforts to build a “rainbow” nation
(appearing at a South African Rugby
World Cup match triumph in a Captain's
jersey was one of many attempts), but
results have been disappointing. Many of
the structures created by apartheid are
slow in disappearing: discrimination

DENNIS Bnurus

against blacks in housing and education is
increasing rather than decreasing.

What is the course for the future? Set
by Mandela and more and more by Thabo
Mbeki, who has been given day-to-day
control, the signs are not good. The RDP
(Reconstruction and Development
Program) on which the ANC was elected
has been abandoned for GEAR (Growth,
Employment and Redistribution), which
represents a retreat since it is based on
plans imitative of SAPS (Structural
adjustment programs)
imposed on other African
countries by the World
Bank, which require
downsizing, privitization
and consequently, mas-
sive unemployment.

Protests against
the World Bank and South
Africa’s “home-grown
SAPs” (called national-
ization plans) are begin-
ning to be heard. Already,
the teachers’ union’s
SADTU has threatened to
engage in a nationwide
strike, and the powerful

ov-

trade union congress
COSATU has muttered
about confronting the

government on its retreat
from RDP. Thabo Mbeki’s
response was to say “GEAR is non-nego-
tiable.”

The Economist recently asked, “Has
the economic miracle faded in South
Africa?” The economic problems else-
where (such as in Asia) have had an
impact: South Africa’s rand has declined
against the British pound and the U.S.
dollar, and unemployment and crime are
both still rising. .

So while we wish Nelson Mandela
and South Africa well, it would also be
well to be aware that there are dark
clouds ahead.

In spite of what you may have heard,
including maxinrs such as “knowing is half
the battle,” learning per se is not always vir-
tuous. Should you read on, you will
encounter two criticisms of different kinds of
learning—theﬁrstdirectedagainstakindof
content and the second against a particular
form of learning.

Barnes & Noble isn’t such a bad estab-
lishment Except for true—blue porno, you
can ﬁnd just about whatever suits your fancy.
Philosophy texts have rarely become best-
sellers, and it is to B & N’s credit that they
maintain such a relatively well—stocked phi-
losophy section.

Inanycase,inthephilosophy section,I
noticed an area called “self—help.” I thought
to myself, “'Ihere’s something I should write
anopirrionabout—andthetitle wouldbeso
neat, albeit corny!” Self—irnprovernent has
always struck me as an essentially confused
genre. Imust admitherethatmy exposureto
thesubjectisquitelimited,butIwillpass
judgement nonetheless. Self—help books are
fmrdamentally contradictory. By reaching
out for someone else’s advice (someone ped-

TH: P111 News

Developing an appetite for instruction

dling the “secrets of success,” for example),
one has already created a relationship of
informational dependence on another —
you don’t stop being a follower (presumably
the objective of much self—irnprovement) by
going someone else’s “way.” To resolve this
dilenrrna, write your own self—help manual.

There are other problems with self—help.
Many seem to have vaguely religious —
mystical is a more appropriate adjective —-
leanings, yielding a typically American phe-
nonrenon: the comfortable coexistence of
contradictory values. American values such
as success, victory and worldly equilibrium
coexist with the professedly Christian cele-
bration of failure and material renunciation
(as the story goes, Jesus was no conquering
heroinordinaryfashion———-histimeasaman
culminated in his agonizing cruciﬁxion and
his sufferings are supposed to be admirable).
The American is supposed to focus pragmat-
icallyontheherearrdnow;theChristianis
supposed to look forward to vindication in
the hereafter. And yet, much self—irnprove-
ment propaganda that professes to reveal
howtobecornenurnberone hasthat“spiri—
trial” aspect.

My second criticism concerns a form of
learning. I like to approach texts with an

uncluttered mind, and to confront the
thoughts of the author responsible for the
words. However, I often ﬁnd that, having
borrowed books from I-Iillrnan, some nerd
has found it necessary to scribble his
thoughts in the margins of the text. This
unwanted marginalia interrupts my afore-
mentioned approach by making me. focus
more on the highlighted sections.
Presumably, the notes were supposed to
help the nerd out when he looked back
through the text for signiﬁcant sections (To
write a paper? For a grade?) This scribbling
isvandalism,butIthinkitisalsosympto—
matic of a larger disease. Many students
havebeeninculcatedinthernetlrodofsteady
note-taking in class, and no doubt this tech-
nique has spilled over into the lamentable
vandalism of public texts. I have always
resisted note-taking, and I think more stu-

supposedtohavearrmernonic function—-
one should be able to look through one’s
notesandrecallalltherelevantpartsofthe
professor’s lecture. However, it seems that
students take notes primarily in order to
avoid falling asleep because professors don’t
work hard enough to earn and maintain stu-
dents’ attentions. Other clever students use

the notebook in a defensive tactic, bending
over their notebook when the professor asks
for questions, as if to say, “Don’t bother me
now, I’m taking crucial notes!”

We’ve inherited note-taking from
ancient Greece. Aristotle, say, would stand in
ﬁont of a group of boys and recite his lecture
ﬁorn his own notes. Students would copy
down what Aristotle said The Greeks had
neither printing presses nor photocopiers, so
I suspect that the lecture style coupled with
note-taking was simply the most eﬁicient
formula for distributing information. Given
our more eﬂicient technology, I think that
note—tala'ng, and perhaps lectures, too, are
obsolete Professors should recognize this
andphotocopytheirnotes fortheclass.

I would hope that in an environment
like the university, more professors would
have the coinage to admit the obsolescence
of note—takingandlect1rres. ButI suspectthat

to a completely new low in the

Not that it’s entirely the fault
of publishers. People have long
thought that after Memorial Day
pops onto the calendar, all serious

thinking should be cast

aside. Move over “Of

for "Ihe Bridges of

(Incidentally, the movie

Cmlot cluster  

By GEOFFREY W._ MELADA

It was not terribly surprising when
new Civic Light Opera executive produc-
er Van Kaplan came on stage before the
opening night performance of ”Camelot,”
apologized for last week's poor produc-
tion of ”Gigi” and welcomed everybody
back to the CLO.

VVrth its tumbling sets and atrocious
French accents, ”Gigi” did not exactly
build momentum for the next Lerner and
Loewe musical. But, fortunately for
Kaplan, the CLO audience, aware of the
virtual indestructibility of "Camelot/’
returned to the Benedum Center for its
July 7 premiere.

As it turned out, what awaited the
audience was not quite the unsinkable
Broadway classic that most of us remem-
ber. Anyone who had seen ﬂie original
Tony Award-winning production about
the romantic triangle between the noble
King Arthur, his errant Queen Guenevere
and trusted knight Lancelot, starring Julie
Andrews, Robert Goulet and Richard
Burton was aware of the many unﬂatter-
ing changes made to the script by director
Bruce Lumpkin

The removal of the songs ”You May
Take me to the Fair" and ”Fie on
Goodness!” trimmed down a long show,
but this turned an already somber affair
into something almost too pathetic. John
Farrell's drab and static set design (per-
haps more suited to a production of
“Macbeth” than to ”Camelot”), and John
Mcl_ain’s insufficient lighting add to the
problem. And it’ s certainly not helped by
Merilyn Caskey’ s (Guenevere) melodra-
matic breakdown in her duet ”What Do
the Simple Folk Do?”

The show also has other problems.
Tim Hartman (Merlin), Sean Hennigan
(Pellinore) and Jeremy Webb (Mordred)
give admirable performances, but the
three leads fail to satisfy. Neither Noel
Harrison (Arthur) nor Patrick Cassidy
(Lancelot) are particularly good singers,
and although Merilyn Caskey’s musician-
ship is scrupulous, she is a bit too mature
for the role of Guenevere.

But the show’ s remaining pleasures —
gorgeous costumes and a ﬁne orchestra -
should make audience members look for-
ward to what will hopefully be better pro-
ductions of ”Phantom” and ”On the
Town.”

»The beft c -

are Sl'll
to come

By SAFULA LEWIS

It's been said that a city's culture
and hipness could be measured by the
concerts and artists that perform there.

Judging from the bands hitting
Pittsburgh over the rest of the summer,
Pittsburgh is the place to be.

The remaining Spice Girls will
attract screams of young girls and
ogling eyes of young boys tonight at
the Star Lake Amphitheatre. The
hottest female singing group in the
world just lost the services of Ginger

- Spice, but they still know how to put

on a- show.

The rest of the summer looks
bright with the Lilith Fair, Warped
Tour, Phish and Matchbox 20 on the
horizon.

Lilith Fair comes to the Star lake
Amphitheatre Aug. 9. Founder Sarah
McLachlan has proclaimed it to be a
celebration of women in music — an

all-fernale tour that will make its way
through North America.

Emphasis of the to_ur is placed on
emerging and developing talents as
well as established artists. The mix of
electrifying artists ranges from Fiona
Apple, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne,
McLachlan and Eyraka Badu to Tracy
Chapman, the Indigo Girls, Victoria
Wlliarns and Juliana Hatﬁeld. The
diversity of women ensures a unique
festival on the summer circuit.

Last. year, Lilith Fair made a dona-
tion in each city to a local charity or
women's group. The same spirit will
be present this year, with $1 from each
ticket going to a local organization.

Arriving before Lilith Fair is its
180-degree alternative, Warped Tour
'98, a travelling rock exhibition that’ s

MatchBox 20 nearly rounds out summer concerts in Pittsburgh this August

  

supposed to be the wildest thing since

. the heyday of Lollapalooza. It brings

pop-punl<ers NOFX, Bad Religion,
Rancid and many others to the IC
Light Ampitheatre July 21.

This summer, Warped Tour also
sports the hottest top-ranked profes-
sional and amateur athletes in X-
Garne-like competitions.

The adrenaline level is likely to
decrease for Phish Aug. 11 at Star
Lake. Although they already had
legions of loyal fans, Phish effectively
picked up the banner left by the
demise of the Grateful Dead.

Last but not least, the popular
band MatChBox 20 will rock Star Lake
on Aug. 15. Sernisonic, Soul Asylum
and Dharma Sonswilljoin them.

There's something for everyone.

Film series returns in force

‘By HENRY 1. MASON

Looking for an inexpensive way
to spend some of those late summer
evenings? Tired of paying inﬂated
ticket prices to watch bands that
suck? -
Perhaps it’ s time to take a look at
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Film
Series, and catch up on some of those
classic films you never saw on the
big screen. Maybe you missed
Trainspotting in theaters and want to
rectify the error. Maybe your life
companion is a film fanatic, and
you'd like to make up for all those
soggy block-busters and strange art
ﬁhns you refused to see during the
summer.

In any case, the film series is an
excellent deal. Every evening at 7:30,
from July 24 to August 30. a different
film is shown at the Byharn Theater
downtown, ranging from true das-
sics such as Citizen Kane and
Casablanca to modern ground-break-

ers such as
Trainspotting and Fargo.
There are more
obscure (and possibly
the better for it) classics
such as Stanley
Kubrick's Dr.
Strangelove as well.
This film series is
essentially the work of one man,
Richard Rauh, the film director of the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Starting in
1997, he picked ﬁhns that he liked
and thought people would appreci-
ate being able to see on the big screen
- and the series met with unexpected
popularity-
, This second year, the series offers
a greater variety of ﬁhns and a slight-
ly less eclectic selection, giving view-
ers an even better opportunity to see
some of the most critically-acdaimed
movies of this century the way they
were intended to be seen.
When possible, movies are
shown in the original 70 mm

  

matown

- Faye Dunaway In

widescreen format, catering to even
the most extreme film buffs. It’ s what
happens when someone combines
their enthusiasm for film with an
established organization, and counts
on the public interest in film to pay
for an experience (short of owning a
movie theater and a large print
archive) that’ s very difficult to come
by-

Although film buffs are the

series’ target audience, there is some-

thing here for everyone. If your date
isn't interested in Dr. Zhivago, you
can always watch Chinatown the next
week. They're not all classics, but
they're all entertaining.

Meanwhile, Ted, who had been told by
Healey that Mary turned into a fat, paralyzed
slum—dweller, comes to seek her out himself.

Both Healey and Ted vie for Mary, with
Healey playing devious tricks to rid Mary of Ted.
Mary's neighbor's terrier, first on sleeping pills
then later on speed, provides two spectacularly
funny sequences-

With There's Something About Mary's R rating,

the Farrelly brothers are allowed to be cruder,
ruder, grosser and much more graphic
than they were in the PG-13 rated
Kingpin. No gross detail is spared, and no
subject is low enough. For example, the
jokes involving the mentally handi-
capped, or ”those goofy bastards,” which
is what Healey calls them, are exceptional-
ly cruel but hilarious.

The Farrelly’s new movie is better than
their previous two because of the subject —
not because of its cruder, crueler humor. The

jokes involving several guys falling over
themselves to be with Mary elevate this
movie above any other film relying purely
on sight gags.
Great gags, hilarious characters (Lin
Shaye, who played the grotesque landla-
dy in Kingpin, Harland Williams as a
hitchhiker, and insincere Chris Elliott,
in particular) and sadism by the buck-
etful more than make up for the lack
of something cerebral.

Shue in Cousin Bette, the new film adaptation of
Honore de Balzac’s classic novel.

Set in Paris, France in the late 1840s, this peri-
od comedy deals with the themes of obsession,
revenge and lust.

Jessica Lange turns in a marvellous perfor-
mance as Bette, a spinster seamstress who saves
the young destitute artist Wenceslas (Aden
Young) from starvation and supplies him with
materials for his sculpting.

She coddles him to the point of suffocation by
setting rigid work hours for him, fixing him to a
stringent meal plan and laying out his life. Bette’s
niece Hortense (Kelly MacDonald), who is mar-
ried to Baron Hulot (Hugh Laurie), is intrigued
by Bette’s romance with Wenceslas.

Hortense pursues

Wenceslas (first by buying his ‘WW 59?“
sculptures, then by meeting him Directed by
behind Bette’s back), and even— Des McAnuff
tually marries him. As revenge, Stan-mg Jgsslca
Bette deviously plans the Hulot Langegand
farnily’s demise. Elisabeth Shue

Lange plays sadism and
crueltry with renewed vigor. She does a great job
portraying the destructive and manipulative
character, and one ends up cheering, not jeering,
her. The film's other characters who are affected
by her schemes are portrayed as deserving suck-
ers.

The supporting cast does well, too. Laurie is
wonderfully foppish as Baron Hulot, who is infat-
uated with Shue’s Jenny Cadine. Shue plays yet
another sultry vixen, but she's not sly enough to
escape Bette’s symphony of destruction.

Lange’s status as one of the best living actress-
es is affirmed by this devilshly comic romp.

The Beastie Boys, one of the

years, continue to keep their sounds
mixed up and unpredictable on
their latest album, Hello Nasty.

The band maintains its empha-
sis on hip-hop, but blends bass-
thumping beats and lyrical gymnas-
tics with some swaggering lounge
sounds (”Song For The Man”),
spacey robot voices
(”Intergalactic”), and soft Billy
Corgan—esque lyrics over wind
chimes (”Instant Death”).

Since ”Fight For Your Right”
was released in 1986, the Beastie
Boys have been known for injecting
humor into their music. This album
is no different.

Lines like ”Sometimes I like to
brag, sometimes I'm soft spo-
ken/ When I'm in Holland, I eat the
pannenkoeken” and ”I got books
with hooks and it looks like
rain / Would someone on the Knicks
please drive the lane” will keep lis-
teners in tears.

The modern band with more
genres than anyone except Beck will
definitely go multi-platinum with
Hello Nasty, and it's not because
MTV is pushing Beastie Boys’
videos. It's because they're still one
of the best bands in the business.

Cowboy junkies

Geffen Records
If the Cowboy Junkies could

Tm: Prrr News l I I

choose a code, it would be to do
things their own way. It's a mantra
the Toronto-based Junkies actually
follow, and they follow it quite a bit.

Ever since they shocked the
music world by slowing down Lou
Reed's ”Sweet Jane” even further
and recording their debut album in
a church, the Junkies have followed
their own brand of music that’ s too
hip for Nashville and too down-
home for New York.

They follow the same path
for their new album, Miles From
Home. It's even more au natural in
the sense that listeners hear the
voice (Margo Timmins), guitar
(Michael Timmins), drums (Peter
Timmins), bass (Alan Anton) and
mild assorted help — nothing more,
nothing less.

Timmins’ singing will rake
you in. If you like your Cowgirls to
sound desolate, take notes Shania,
she's your woman.

The music itself is as mature
as it gets —- mature in the sense of
it's not pop and it's not Hanson by
any means. Can you perform songs
that span themes like the fear of
growing old (”Those Final Feet”),
lost love (”The Summer Of
Discontent”) and the return of Jesus
(”Good Friday”) with pop? I don't
think so. .

But these songs (and a few
more) are at home with the Junkies,
and they fit the vocals of Ms.
Timmins to a T.

Miles From Home is cool
music that's a good listen. The
Junkies will never be fully accepted
by the new-age Nashville set. But
with a loyal following built by mak-
ing albums their own way, The
Cowboy Junkies don't need to beg
for acceptance.

Fancis to
Carolina, what
about the Pens?

Ron Francis has signed with the
Carolina Hurricanes for four years and
$20.8 million; the Penguins have lost the
heart and soul of their team, leaving the
future of the franchise in jeopardy.

Sure this is a great ﬁt for Francis, and
all Pittsburgh fans should be happy for
him, but they should be very sad for the
state of their hockey club. 9

Francis is moving to a young team to
join the likes of Nelson Emerson. He is
also going to the ﬁanchise where he got his
start in the league, although that was
before the age of franchise—ﬁee agency
when they were the Hartford Whalers, not
the Hurricanes.

Francis leads the Carolina/Hartford
franchise in almost all categories, though
those record books started in the old mall
in Connecticut.

Carolina hopes this move will help ,

their attendance woes and make hockey
interesting in a warm-weather climate

 R IS THE Prrr News-

Zimmewrmcm goes to Duquesne

Brian Knavish

Asst. Sports Edltor

After rumors ﬂoated around for weeks,
it was a forgone conclusion that quarterback
Tony Zimmerman would leave the
University of Pittsburgh. It was just a ques-
tion of when he’d leave and where he’d go.

But the Penn—Traiford graduate made it
oﬂicial on Monday: he’s transferring ﬁom
Pitt all the way down Forbes Avenue to
Duquesne.

The primary reason for Zirmnerman’s
departure is his desire for playing time. After
his poor performance at this spring’s Blue-
Gold game, it became quite obvious that he
would not have a good chance to capture the
Panthers’ starting quarterback slot this sea-
son. But he will most likely be the starting
ﬁeld general for the Dukes.

In high school, Zimmerman put up
mind-boggling numbers, throwing for over
5,000 yards while starting in just two seasons

because of injuries.
He came to Pitt as a highly touted, can’t-

miss recruit three years ago. But a series of »

problems, on and oil” the ﬁeld, have kept
Tony Z. conﬁned to the bench

He took only a couple snaps in just one
game in 1996, his ﬁrst year as a Panther.
Then last year, he got beat out for the starting
position by Pete Gonzalez and Matt Lytle in
training camp. He did not take a single snap
last year and was redshirted.

Zimmerman encountered other prob-
lems during his career as a Panther. Many
fans thought of him as the next Dan Marino
and as the savior of Pitt football. Those kind
of expectations put a great deal of pressure
on a quarterback.

He also had problems grasping Head
Coach Walt Hanis’s complicated West Coast
offense and got involved in some legal trou-
bles after being part of a late-night scuﬂle at
a Denny’s restaurant near his home.

Then, shortly after this spring’s‘ Blue—

Gold game, the rumors of his transfer began.
Most felt he would not go to another
Division I—A school because if he did, he’d
lose a year of eligibility due to NCAA regu-
lations.

The three most commonly rumored
schools for his transfer were Division 11
Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Division
I—AA Youngstown State and, his eventual
choice, Division I-AA non—scholarship
Duquesne.

Ahole does exist in the Dukes’ lineup at
the quarterback position following the grad-
uation of four-year starter Dave Loya, so it
appears that Zimmerman has a perfect
opportunity to step up and display the bril-
liant talent that made him a tremendous high
school quarterback

\V1th Zimmerman gone, Pitt’s quarter-
back situation appears to be a two-man race.
Senior Matt Lytle, the starter in 1996, is the
early favorite to beat out junior college trans-

The Regional Assets District Board
voted 6-1 to approve ftmding for two new
stadiums on the North Side.

The RAD allocated $809 million
Thursday night for the projects which are
bothexpectedtobeﬁnishedbythe 2001 sea-
sons for their respective teams.

The new park for the Pirates is expected
to cost $228 million and seat 38,000. The
Steelers’ new home should cost about $233
million and seat 65,000.

Pittsburgh follows cities like Cleveland
and Baltimore that have made major
improvements to become great places to live
and visit. -

These stadiums and other improve-
ments could make Pittsburgh a tourist desti-
nation, something it is not right now.

Unlike many other cities, the teams who

willplayintheseparkshave donatedalarge
percentage of the construction cost and have
agreed to pay for any amount the construc-
tion runs over budget.

The teams have promised money that
will come ﬁorn naming rights and guaran-
teed revenues, such as those that come from
their respective leagues. The Pirates pledged
$40 million, while the Steelers otfmed $76.5
million.

Both clubs hope to not sell naming
rights sotlreirparkscanbeconnectedtotlre
organizations’ history. Also they may have to
sell Personal Seat Licences for season tick-
ets.

The baseball stadium will be at the end
of the Sixth Street Bridge, with the football
stadium just west of the present Three Rivers
Stadium

The board has to pay the $40 million
debt from Three Rivers Stadium and then
demolish it as well. It will also contribute

$30 million to a new mall on the site of
Three Rivers.

attraction, something tourists will go to the
ﬁrst day they are in town. It could house a
Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood, along
with a Nordstrom’s Department Store.

Both teams hope Port Authority Transit

new ballparks and a proposed light—rail sys-
tem may be constructed to transport people
from the South Side to the North Side in less
than ﬁve minutes.

In the plan, the David L. Lawrence
Convention Center will also receive a well-
deserved and badly needed face—lift for $267
million.

These plans, that have been in the works
since Kevin McClatchy bought the Pirates
three years ago, should guarantee that
Pittsburgh will be a “Major League Town”
for years to come

France conﬁdently defeated heavy
favorite Brazil 3-0 and won the soccer
World Cup for the ﬁrst time.

Les Bleus, as they like to call them-
selves because of the color of their jerseys,
joined an elite club of only six countries
that have won the trophy before Sunday’s
ﬁnal - Germany, Italy (both three times),
Argentina, Uruguay (both two times),
England (once) and Brazil themselves (four
times). Also, France became the sixth host
nation to win a World Cup in only 16 tour-
naments so far.

Subtle playmaker Zinedine Z’

they now hold th _
World Cup history as '
two goals in the competition
throughout). _
V In the ﬁnal, Les Bleus let only a few
balls reach strikers Bebeto and Ronaldo,
which was the main reason for their win.
Even after the best defender of the World
Cup, Marcel Desalliy, was red—carded and
ejected with 22 minutes remaining, the new
champions rarely looked vulnerable.
Because of the rigid French pressure
all over the ﬁeld, the Brazilians never man-
aged to elevate their usually spectacular

I passing game to a level on which they roll

the opposition like in a centrifuge and cre-
ate spaces and score goals. In fact, it was
the ﬁrst game in this World Cup in which
they were shut out.

France was the better team and
deserved the title Brazilian coach Mario
Zagallo admitted after the ﬁnal. Words like
these, apart from the crushing result, will
stay in history. Still, if you look at some
details, some frightening controversies may

appear. Generally speaking, two goals from i

cornerkicks (remember, the third was at a
point of no return for Brazil) never speak in
favor of one’s domination.

' In fact, Les Bleus were never dominant
in this match except for the ﬁrst 20 minutes
(the ﬁrst goal‘ coming in the 27th); Brazil
entertained most of the possession and
managed more shots on goal. VV1th the
result still 0-0, the video replays clearly
showed there was alegal Brazil goal which
was never called when French goalkeeper
Fabienne Bartez lost possession of the ball
for a moment and stepped with it behind
the goalline. .

,  e real revelation in the French
team was the polyfunctional, unstopping
and unstoppable Petit - the player who put
the icing on the cake in the ﬁnal.

But as was already mentioned, other
things will stay in history - the 3-0 defeat of
Brazil which matched the two previous
most lopsided results in World Cup ﬁnals
(Brazil — Sweden 5-2, in 1958: Brazil - Italy,

4-1 in 1970), France going into the record _
books and Zidane being acclaimed as this ‘

year’s World Cup number one.
And some day nobody will ever think

whether Les Bleus would have really

become champions if that Brazilian goal
was called, or if that corner was never
given, or if a foul was whistled against
Zidane for him sending Dunga tumbling.

Soccer is such a dynamic game that
everything changes within seconds,
impressions easily fade and people tend to
forget small injustices that perhaps rewrote
the history books.

holds numerous coaching records and his
Stanley Cup victories tied him with Toe
Blake for the most.

Johnson died in November of 1991, but
the Penguins kept chugging. They backed
into the playoffs after a very diﬂicult season
and went on to win their second straight Cup.

The black cloud that seemed to follow
the team was gone, but for how long?

The next year the Pens won the
President’s Trophy as the best team in the
league and set the record for most consecu-
tive regular season victories with 17.

Mario Lemieux had Hodgkin’s Disease
but still won the scoring title. Howard
Baldwin now owned the team and there was
a new young star in the ‘Burgh, J aromir Jagr
(Mario Jr?).

Nothing could stop this team, right?
Wrong. The Islanders did with a goal in
overtime of game seven in the second round
of the playoffs, and the Penguins have not
been the same since.

Sure, the team keeps winning their divi-
sion and making it into the playoffs, but they
keep losing in the NHL’s second season.
They have been through two coaches since
they ﬁred Bowman, the wirmingest playoff
coach in hockey history. ‘

Lemieux has retired, Baldwin sold half
of the team, they went to a defensive system,
and they raised ticket prices.

This team is now in total disarray.
Lemieux, possibly the most popular athlete
in Pittsburgh today, has sued the team’s new
co-owner Roger Marino who has not paid
him some money his contract guarantees
him.

Marino may have been trying to pres-
sure Lemieux to renegotiate, but he has
caused a public relations disaster. This has
alienated many fans from the glory days of
thePensandcouldcausetheteamtoﬁle

term deal with Fox Sports Pittsburgh in
order to start his own all-sports cable net-
work with the Penguins as it’s anchor.

In addition, the ticket prices have gone
so high it is difficult for people to afford
games, so many are not even close to sell-
cuts.

The team lost $37.5 million over the last
two years. This team could sneak out the
back door in Pittsburgh as everyone cheers
for the new homes of the Pirates and Steelers.

The Penguins are obviously not making
money, and with the huge ownership squab-
ble, the club may have no choice but to leave
Pittsburgh.

Marino has ﬁred Baldwin’s son twice
from jobs with the organization. He has also
tried to undo many of the deals Baldwin
made during his tenure as controlling partner
of the Penguins.

Marine and Baldwin have squabbled so
much that Gary Betteman, the
Commissioner of the NHL, has stepped in to
try and settle things. Each wants to buy the
other’s half of the team, but neither would be
a good owner. Marino has no hockey brains,
and Baldwin has no business know-how.

The team did not even oﬂer Francis a
contract, which is a slap in the face to such a
great player. He must understand they have
problems, but he at least deserves an offer.

The signing of Francis could also let the
spotlight shine on another disgnmtled mem-
ber of Pittsburgh’s hockey community, J agr.
He did not like coach Kevin Constantine’s
system, but Francis, smoothed over all of the
differences. \V1thout Francis one or the other
will have to go.

quarterbaclc,MattO’Connor,alsohasanout-
side shot at cracking the starting lineup.

The quarterback battle will be the high-
light of this year’s training camp, which
begins in n1id—August at Pitt-Johnstown. But

determined at camp.

Onesuchbattlewillbeontheoﬂensive
line where three spots are open after the grad-
uations of Tony Orlandini, Reggie Thomas
and Jolm Marzoch.

Center Andrew Grischow and guard
Ethan Weidle will hold on to their starting
positions: junior college transfers Mark
Browne and Ryan Hansen, along with junior
Justin _Wade, sophomore Mike Bosnic and
ﬁlﬂi-year-senior Jason Dugger will battle
numerous other challengers for those ﬁnal
three spots.

“IthinkIhaveaprettygoodshotatstart—
ing. I’ve worked hard all off-season,” said
Browne, who feels his experience at
Saddleback Junior College has helped get
him ready for Division 1.

school and junior college, but there’s an even
bigger difference between junior college and
Division I,” he said

The other primary position up for grabs
is tailback, where sophomore Kevan Barlow
will battle blue-chip recruit Brandon
Wrlliarns for the starting nod

Three candidates ﬁgure into the mix at
tight end After switching from guard, Ben
Kopp should be a force on blocking plays,
but he’ll have to ﬁght for playing time with
Kirk McMullen and sure-handed Juan
Wrlliarns.

Terry Murphy and Jackie Womack
appeartohavelocksonthestaringwide
receiver slots, but the all-important third
receiver spot is still up in the air.

The defensive line and defensive back-
ﬁeld appear fairly sound. The main question
marks on defense arise at outside linebacker

to step up and ﬂank pre-season All-Big East
middle linebacker Phil Clarke. ‘
