Pitt receives grant to review new AIDS test

3. BY Kathie Roth

5‘;

Staff Writer

A new test designed for early
detection of the AIDS virus is
being reviewed by members of
the Pitt Men’s Study of the
graduate school of public health.

The research will be funded
by an $874,753 grant awarded
by the National Institute of
Allergies and Infectious Diseases.

“This grant allows us to develop
and apply the new test, called

3‘, the polymerase chain reaction,

or PCR, to our natural history
study,” said Charles Rinaldo Jr.,
Ph.D., associate professor of
-pathology and the principal
investigator of the Pitt Men’s
Study.

“PCR is a highly sensitive test
that enables scientists to detect
very small amounts of the AIDS
virus in infected individuals that
one might miss with the widely-

‘ used ELISA and Western Blot

tests,” he said.

Dr. Phalguni Gupta, associate
professor in the department of
infectious diseases and
microbiology who is directing
the research said, “PCR is able to
detect the presence of the Human

‘Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]

before it presents antibodies.

“Only this technique can detect
the presence of the virus in this
stage at this time,” he added.

PCR was originally developed
by ajapanese researcher for uses
other than HIV detection.
Scientists from the Cetus Corp.,
however, brought the test into
other areas of study, and
according to Gupta, it is now
used for detection of many types
of diseases.

“Basically what this test [we'll
be conducting] is about is possible
HIV—infected people. The number
of infected blood cells is very
few, approximately one in a
million. Conventional tests cannot
always detect those few cells.
This test ampliﬁes up to a
millionfold the DNA that is present
in infected cells in test tubes and
so allows for much earlier
detection than conventional
testing methods.”

This ampliﬁcation is caused by
a DNA polymerase enzyme of a
bacteria which lives in hot springs
such as Yellowstone National
Park, he said.

Though experts are not sure of _

the failure of detection rate by
other tests in the Pittsburgh area,
he said, “There is evidence

enough from other cities such as
Los Angeles that there may be
quite a few.”

According to Gupta, it is not
yet certain how many subjects
will be included in the study, but
blood samples from mostly
homosexual and bisexual men
will be used. These subjects have
not tested positive for the HIV.

Testing areas will include high-
risk groups, individuals who have
had indeterminate test results,
neither positive nor negative, and
a search for the HIV in semen. It
is hoped that this study will be
used to determine the natural
history of the disease at the earliest
time of infection —-— when there
is no apparent antibody presence.

The PCR test still has only
limited applications at this time
due to several reasons. “It is
expensive, approximately $150
to $200 per test. It is still in a very
experimental stage. Because it is
so sensitive, if [the PCR test] is not
done very carefully, it can produce
false positive results.”

However, Gupta said, “We have
performed the study a few times
for some area hospitals on organ
donor transplants to be sure [as
to the presence of AIDSI.”

He stressed that the test is not

a clinical tool and is not for just
anyone. It is still just a research
tool and has not been FDA
approved.

He suspects that the FDA will
“be looking into the study here at
Pitt, but the study has nothing to
do with the test gaining approval.”

The Pitt Men’s Study hopes that
the work, which is expected to
last for longer than the two-year
period of the federal grant, will
determine the natural history or
developmental stages of the
disease.

Gupta said, “If we can
determine these infections at the
very earliest time, we may
discover how long the HIV
antibody takes to develop in an
infected patient.

“We believe that in some people
the virus may lay dormant for
several years before antibodies
are detectable. If we can use PCR
to identify this type of infection,
physicians may be able to begin
monitoring these individuals
much sooner, possibly
intervening with drug therapy,
and thus potentially prolonging
patients’ lives,” said Rinaldo.

Creativity
outlet for
mental

patients

By Phillip Gesue
For The Pitt News

Art provides Beckyjean Taylor
with an outlet for her depressed,
angry feelings.

"I like to create art when I’m
depressed. Depression is anger
directed inward, and artistic
expression helps me to let out
those feelings,” says Taylor.

She is one of the 90 members
of the art therapy group of
Western Psychiatric Institute’s
Therapeutic Learning Center who
is involved in creating the center’s
1990 wall calendar.

The art and poetry was chosen
by the creative expression
counselors and thereditor and
graphic designer for the calendar.
Featuring the sculpture, painting
and poetry of its members, the
calendar commemorates the 10th
anniversary of the Therapeutic
Learning Center.

The calendar is not only unique
in its art and poetry forms, but is
also the first calendar in the United
States to feature the artwork of
patients with long-term mental
illnesses.

The Therapeutic Learning
Center’s purpose is to assist in
rehabilitating patients with
schizophrenia through the aid of
psychotherapy. Artistic and poetic
self-expjessions are just some of
the many facets of the learning
center.

Said calendar project director
and musical expression therapist
S. Charlene Pavlik, “Fewer people
take the time to express their
creativity than in the past;
however, the learning center gives
patients the opportunity to put
their feelings and ideas into either
art or poetry; it is a valuable,
visual means of helping patients
to better understand and confront
their problems.”

Beginning in the late teens and
persisting through life,
schizophrenia is a devastating,
chronic mental illness that affects
one in 100 people in the United
States and for which no cure has
yet been found. It is characterized
by hallucinations of voices and
results in reduction of external
interests, inappropriate emotional
responses and inability to interact
in social situations.

Art and poetry therapy lets
patients direct their feelings into
whatever medium they choose
to use, whether it be pen and
paper or sculpture.

Leaning back on his desk chair,
Herb Ferguson seems to be
critically observing the ‘walls in
his tiny office.

They are covered with pictures
and include small plaques with
such sayings as: “I stop for
photographs,” and “Creative
minds are never tidy.” The
bookshelves, which touch the
ceiling, are loaded with negatives,
slides, photography books and,
of course, more pictures.

People have often enjoyed the
numerous photographs that have
been taken of the city of
Pittsburgh. Also enjoyable have
been the many ‘artistic
photographs of Pitt’s Cathedral
of Learning and other campus
locations which appear bimonthly
in Pz'ttMagaz1'ne, as well as many
publications all over the world.

These photographs are

‘sometimes a joint effort and other
times are the work of an
individual. But whether a
collaboration or a single effort,
one can very often ﬁnd Pitt
photographer/producer Herb
Ferguson behind the camera.

Ferguson, who has traveled
extensively around the world,
has approximately 100,000
personal photographs in his
possession. He has done

promotional work for numerous

magazines, ad agencies and
universities but appears to enjoy
photographing scenic locations
the most. I
“I’m sure thatl have as many as
30,000 to 50,000 pictures of the
city of Pittsburgh," he says. “And
in places like Stockholm, England,
I could just freak out. I could
spend weeks photographing

' places like that."

A graduate of Pennsylvania
State University, Ferguson holds
a bachelor’s degree in zoology/
entomology (the study of insects)
as well as a master’s degree in

‘ education from the University of

p THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, November 29, 1989
Pitt photographer's portfolio
covers lifetime of experiences

Pittsburgh, and a degree in
photography from the Rochester
Institute of Technology.

He prefers to remain strictly a
photographer and is not interested
in lending his services to other
aspects of magazines and other
types of publications. “I am a
horrible writer,” he said.

When asked why he obtained
a degree in zoology/ entomology,
Ferguson, replied that he has
always had an extensive interest
in theoutdoorlife. “When I was

a kid, for some reason I always

thought it would be fun to be a
farmer,” he said;

Ferguson has worked for Pitt a
total of 26 years. Until
approximately 11 years ago, he
was the director of medical media
in the Health Center at Pitt. He
held this position for 16 years
and said because of a merger of
departments at Pitt, he landed a
job as photographer/producer,
editing and developing as well as
just taking pictures.

“I decided that if everyone else
wanted to do the managing, that
was just fine. I’ll just take the
pictures,” Ferguson said.

Currently, Ferguson’s job at Pitt
involves photographing
magazines, brochures and
promotional work for all of the
departments at the university, with
most of his international travel
taking place du_ring the summer

1‘ months.

Ferguson has traveled to
approximately 36 countries and
hopes to visit 100 by the end of
his career.

In 1979, he traveled to Poland
with the university, producing a
slide show and touring with it
around the Eastern United States.

“I talked to many welcome-
wagon clubs. We took the [slide]
show all over the states and
eventually to Germany,” said
Ferguson.

In 1984, Ferguson attended the
Semester at Sea program and
spent time in. Sri Lanka on
assignment. This past summer,

jozmczicom culture
, focus of celebration

By Tammy Richardson
Staff Writer

The Latin dancers are ready, the reggae band is set, and all
systems are go as the Caribbean and Latin American Students
Association prepares for its 10th annual “Caribbean Dinner and
Dance,”

The dinner, which is being held this Saturday evening in the
‘a William Pitt Union, is intended to expose both native American

and Latin Pitt students to Caribbean culture. This event is open
to all students and has been held annually since the group’s
formation in 1978. Each year its focus is on a different Latin
American country.

According to the chairwoman of the dinner’s program
committee, Sandria Caine, “This year the focus is on Jamaica.”

Caine pointed out that there is a need for increased awareness
of Caribbean cultures. She noted that “exposure to the Caribbean
is essential to intercooperation." She also considers the dinner
. to be an “opportunity to enhance the studies of Latin American
students” with a reminder of their heritage.

Caine estimated the total cost of the dinner/dance to be
approximately $3,000. She said that since university funding
covers only a small portion of that bill, the cost per student will

unless he is a college professor,”
he said. “Actually, I was a
professional student for a long
time. I should probably have a
couple of doctorates by now.

“When you're in and out of the
business world, it’s demeaning.
If you went down the list of the
Fortune 500, I bet 90 percent of

ago, none had anything above a
bachelor’s degree.

“It seems like we don’t need a
piece of paper to be good
businessmen,” he added.

Ferguson has di_sp_lgyed his

talents in the “Pittsburgh Pleasures
Events Calendar” for the past six
years. The calendar includes 13
of Ferguson’s color photographs,
plus over 800 listings of things to
do in Pittsburgh, ranging from
sports to cultural events.

For one of the pictures in the
calendar, Ferguson “sweet talked”
his way into a Parkvale Savings
hot air balloon to get the exact
picture that he wanted.

. However, though he enjoys
working on the calendar,
Ferguson does not believe that is
where the money is.

“IA photographer] must get in
good with an ad agency or art

directors. That's the way of the
business world. Pittsburgh has
an incredible number of
photographers —— too many, in
fact. A lot of the [ad] agencies
have the New York syndrome.
They believe that only New York
is capable of producing quality
pictures.”

The calendar attempts to
displace the myth of Pittsburgh
as a smoky, dirty, industrial town.

“You have to bring the people
here [to Pittsburgh]. You can talk
yourself blue in the face, but
people still won’t believe [that
Pittsburgh is more than just a
smoky city!” .

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Oh, sweet revenge... Panthers topple Siena

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers dodged the
sharp outside shooting of the
Siena Saints to open their 1989-
90 season with a 101-89 triumph
in front of 6,489 spectators at
Fitzgerald Field House Tuesday

Pitt jumped out to an early
lead andnever looked back as
point guard Darelle Porter
sparked the Panther attack from
the outside and Brian Shorter
dominated the boards and the
inside game to hold off the Saints
and their perimeter attack.

“We feel pretty good about
the game,” Pitt coach Paul Evans‘
said. “Obviously, they’re a tough
team to defend. They have a lot
of shooters and a lot of kids that
can put up the three-pointers.”

This was a rematch of last
year’s contest when the infamous
inbounds pass bounced off of
Bobby Martin’s hands and into
the surprised arms of Siena’s Steve
McCoy , who put up a shot at the
buzzer to shock the Panthers in
80-79 upset at the Field House.

Pitt came out and repeatedly
took the ball to the hoop against
their smaller opponents in order
to make sure that this season’s
game would not come down to
one play in the closing seconds.

“We knew that we had the
inside advantage on them, so we
just tried to go inside as much as
possible,” said Shorter, who led
Pitt with 29 points and 11
rebounds.

But even though Pitt seemd
to be able to score easily, or at
least get fouled and get to the
free—throw line, the Panthers
could never get to the point of
blowing Siena away — a fact not
ignored by the Panther players.

“They like to run just like we
do,” Shorter said. “They had some
plays that allowed them to get
back in the game.”

Siena coach Mike Deane, who
is in charge of a team that is a
favorite to win the Metro Atlantic

Athletic Conference North
Division, was not enamored with
the fact that his team had played
well but still lost. '

Deane gave much of the credit
for the Pitt win to Shorter.

“We went into the game
saying that Martin and [Shorter]
would be the two guys that had
to beat us. We said that we were
going to put an army around
Shorter. Unfortunately, our army
wasn’t big enough in this game,”
Deane said.

Shorter was followed in the
scoring department for Pitt by
Porter and Martin, both of whom
scored 21 points. Porter hit three
of five three—poi_nt shots, while
the 6’9" Martin surprised the
crowd with a three—point basket
of his own. Reserve point guard

Pat Cavanaugh added 12 ponts, V

while Brookin was the other
Panther in double ﬁgures with
10.

Marc Brown, whom Brookin
said is “the only guy I’ve seen
who could compete with Larry
Bird from three-point range” led
Siena with 20 points. Steve
Downey (18), Tom Huerter (16)
and Mike Brown (16) represented
the other major portion of the
Saints offense.

Pitt maintained a lead until
well into the second half, when
Siena closed to within five of the
Panthers on a Bruce Schroeder
layup with approximately 13
minutes left in the game.

Shorter then responded with
a turnaround jumper to spark
Pitt, and the Panthers maintained
a six-to—ten—point cushion for
much of the remainder of the
game.

The highlight of the game for
Pitt came with 4:30 left, when
Porter got the ball after a missed
Schroeder free—throw and went
coast—to-coast for a monstrous
dunk right over seven-foot Saint
center Steve Downey.

NOTES: Pitt point guard Sean
Miller says that he will decide
today whether or not to take a
redshirt for this season or to try

and play through his stress
fracture. Miller said the pain in

K his left foot increased as practice

went on yesterday and that he
felt a sharp pain during the
warmups of the Siena game.

.“If it hurts [today], I'm going
to go ahead and get my
operation,” Miller said. “The
operation could be as early as
next week or it could be in a
couple of weeks, after Dr.

[Freddie] Fu gets back from
Ireland,” where he is
accompanying the Panther
football team for its weekend
matchup with Rutgers in the
Emerald Isle Classic II in Dublin.

Shorter and Porter major factors in Panther victory

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Mike Deane got right to the
point after his Siena basketball
team lost to Pitt 101-89 last night
at Fitzgerald Field House.

“The problems were [Brian]
Shorter and [Bobby] Martin,” the
fourth year coach said. “We didn't

e have anybody to match up with

them.

Shorter rocked the Saints with
29 points and 11 rebounds while
shooting 67% percent from the
ﬂoor. Martin connected on seven
of 11 field goals, including a
three—pointer, and pulled down
eight boards.

That was Deane’s point. Pitt’s
point is known as Darelle Porter.

Porter, starting his first regualr
season game in place of injured
point guard Sean Miller, dealt out
12 assists, had two steals and
scored 21 points while playing 39
minutes.

Oh, yeah. And he dunked over
a seven—footer.

With 4:30 remaining to play
and the Panthers up 87-78, Porter
pushed the ball down the left
side of the court following a
missed free throw by Siena’s
Bruce Schroeder. With the sure-
handed and taller Shorter
streaking down the right side of
the court, Saints center Steve

Downey was
situation.

But as Downey looked for
Porter to pass the ball to Shorter,
Porter went up and over the
seven-foot junior for a resounding
slam that ignited the crowd, the
Pitt team and the Panther bench.

in a no—win

“Their seven-footer saw me
coming and thought I was going
to pass but I just went up and
attacked him,” Porter said. ‘I was
surprised I went up that high.”

Downey didn't like the fact that
Porter, at 6'4", paid no heed to
the height difference. “I didn't
realize I was that far under the

basket. I was trying to take a
charge.

“Frankly, I don’t feel like talking
about it,” he said.

“Porter's dunk was a great
athletic basketball play, but more
importantly it took all the heart
out of us,” said Deane, whose
Siena squad dealt Pitt a last-
second, 80-79 defeat at the ﬁeld
House last year.

The 21 points was a career-
high for Porter, and the 12 assists
tied his career—high.

With Miller out, possibly for
the season, Porter stands to see

the majority of time at the point,
with senior Pat Cavanaugh, who
scored a career—high 12 points,
spelling him.

But Miller, who watched his
team play from the bench for the
first time since he was “five or
six, " said, “He doesn’t need much
help the way he moved tonight."

Panther forward Rod Brookin
saw it this way: “Darelle’s like Bo
Jackson. He can do it all. He
could play ice hockey and score
on Rob Brown, or whoever the
Penguins goalie is.”

Maybe the Pens should put
Porter on their first line.

Freshmen make key contribution to Lady Panthers

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team will look to build on last
year’s 11-17 record, with five
freshmen playing key roles.

All five freshmen were valuable
contributors to Pitt’s victory in
this past weekend’s Lady Panther
Invitational at Fitzgerald Field
House. Maureen McConnell, Jill
McElhinny and Turia Ransom
started both games in the
tournament and will see plenty
of action this season around All-
American candidate Lorri Johnson
and forward Connie Hurt.
Freshmen Lisa Fessler and Tiffany
Fingers saw quality time off the
bench.

Among the starters, McE1hinny
totaled 20 points in the
tournament with six assists in
each game. McConnell scored 15
points and Ransom compiled 23
points and had 12 rebounds in
the championship game against
Delaware.

Head coach Kirk Bruce said he
liked what he saw from the
freshmen and added that they
did a good job against quality
competition in their first two
games. ’

“They played against‘ girls with
experience,” said Bruce. V

Bruce showed over the
weekend that the freshmen ‘will
get a lot of playing time.
McElhiriny played 75 minutes in
the tournament, including all 40
on Friday against Cleveland State;
McConnell played 63 minutes and
Ransom played 58 minutes.

Pitt had to contend with two
bigger teams, Cleveland State and
Delaware. Bruce said he wanted
to speed up the pace of the game
to counter the opponents’ size.

Controlling the pace of a game
is mostly the responsibility of the

- point guard, and at Pitt that would

be McConne1l’s job.

McConnell said she does not
mind the pressure.

“I just [have] to keep my head
in the game,” said McConnell. “I
[have] to see the whole court and
make sure I know who’s open.”

McConnell said she needs some
experience to make her “court
smart."

. Jitters seemed to be a problem
for Mclilhinny and Ransom in the
first game against Cleveland State.
McElhinny committed 1 1
nirnovers, seven in the first half,
but hit two key free throws in the
last minute in Pitt’s 77-73 win in
the first round.

“Jill’s going to be like that,” said
Bruce. “She may turn the ball
over. That's one bad thing that
may happen. But then she ’s going
to make ﬁve good things happen.”

McElhinny probably will not
start oncejennifer Shingler returns
from an ankle injury for next
Sunday's game against Virginia
Commonwealth.

McElhinny will still see time for
her ability to play both guard
positions and her excellent
defensive play. She said she never
played guard before, being the
second tallest player on her high
school team (Loyalsock High
School, Williamsport, Pa.) but she
likes playing there. ,

“I love‘a challenge,” she said.

Ransom was not the force that
she wanted to be in the first
game, scoring eight points
compared to 1 5 in the
championship game.

“I was psyched up for [the first
game],’’ said Ransom. “But then
when I got out there, I played a
little scared. I thought I'd settle
down but I was playing scared all
through [the gamel.”

She said the jitters did not return
for the championship game,
adding 12 rebounds to her 15
points.

While most Pitt students were
watching snow fall over
Thanksgiving break, the Lady
Panther volleyball team spent the
holiday in sun-drenched Southern
California. It was no day at the
beach for the Lady Panthers,
however. They lost two matches
to the 16th— ranked University of
Southern California, 3-0, ,3-1,
dropping their record to 28-9.

Pitt managed to stay close to
the Women of Troy in the first
game Friday night, losing 15-13,

but USC rolled in the second,
winning 15-1 before clinching
the match with a tight 15-12
victory. A

“The first match was more of a
learning [experience] for us. We
played all right, but we didn’t
play up to our potential,” said Pitt
assistant coach Sue Hoover. “We
lforcedl a lot of our own errors. I
think if we had kept the ball in
play, we could have competed a
little better.”

Dee MacAuley hit for nine kills
Friday, while Michele Adamson
contributed seven and Kelly
Matheis six in the loss.

Saturday night, Pitt came out a
little more prepared and won the
first game 15-6, but USC took
over again taking the last three
games, 15-3, 15-1, 15-7.

“They had great blocking;
they’ve got a lot of tall girls;
they’re just a great team," Hoover
said.

Matheis led the team with eight
kills Saturday, ﬁve more than any
other Lady Panther, but it wasn’t
enough. Pitt hit for a season-low
.000 kill percentage (kills minus
errors divided by total attempts)
Saturday.

Despite the losses, Pitt accepted

Lady Hoopsters host weekend tournament and win

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
squad won the Lady Panther
Invitational held at the Fitzgerald
Field House this past weekend to
open their 1989-90 season.

The Lady Panthers beat
Cleveland State 77-73 in Friday's
opening round and knocked off
Delaware Sunday afternoon in
the championship game with a
score of 73-56. ’

Pitt was a big question mark
going into this weekend's action
because they had to start three
freshmen. The only constants in
the starting lineup from last year
were forward Lorri Johnson and
center Connie Hurt.

The freshman played well,
led by starting guards Maureen
McConnell andJill McElhinny and
starting forward Turia Ransom.

“I was surprised that the
freshmen came through so well,”
said Johnson, who led all players
in the tournament with a 23.5
points—per-game average. “Last
year we finished in third place in
this tournament and our goal this
year was to win it.”

Pitt did not emerge victorious
without a struggle, however,
especially in the first contest
against a Cleveland State team
coming off a 3-26 season.

The Vikings hung tough with
Pitt through much of the opening
half, and if it were not for the
stellar play of Johnson early on in
the game, Pitt could have found
itself in a deep hole.

But as it turned out, Johnson
hit a layup and a three-point shot
for Pitt’s first points and
consistently kept Pitt close

throughout. She hit an 18-foot
jumper with just over seven
minutes left on the clock to give
Pitt its first lead, 18-17.

Once Pitt led, they never
looked back as Hurt
complemented Johnson’s efforts
with strong play inside to close
out the first half and help give Pitt
a 32-27 halftime lead.

Beginning with another
Johnson 18—footer, the Lady
Panthers took control of the
contest early in the second half
and allowed Cleveland State to
get within two points of tying the
game only when there were 10
seconds left on the clock.

Johnson added eight
rebounds to go with her 25 points
in the game, and Hurt added 13
points and 13 rebounds.
McElhinny, who struggled in the
first half with seven turnovers,
seemed to settle down as the
game went on and finished with
12 points and six assists to offset
her 12 giveaways.
Ransom and McConnell each
had eight points in the game,

while Lisa Fessler chipped in with 7

five.

The championship game was
over almost as soon as it started.
When McConnell slung a pass in
the deep left corner to set up a
three-point goal from Johnson,
the Lady Panthers scored the first
points of the game and took a
lead they never relinquished.

Delaware cut the deficit to
two at the 15:38 mark, but could
not get closer than ﬁve for the
rest of the half. Johnson again
led Pitt in the scoring category, as

-she pumped in 22 to go along

with 1 1 rebounds. Meanwhile,
Ransom made a big impact in the

’ guard Jennifer

low post, scoring 15 points and
grabbing 12 boards to lead Pitt in
that category.
Hurt was the only other Pitt
player in double figures with 13.
“We got better today,” Bruce
said after Sunday's ﬁnal. “We got

OVCI OUT IICIVOUSXICSS and W6 _

beat a team that won 24 games
last season (Delaware went 24-6
in 1988-89) so that just tells you
how well we played."

Because of an injury to senior
Shin gler,
McElhinny was forced into the
starting rotation.

“Jill is making things happen,”
Bruce said. “What she has inside
her you just cannot coach. She
just decides to do something and

goes out and does it.”

Bruce seemed pleased with
the play of Hurt, whom he said
would have to “put up or shut
up" this year.

However, Bruce was still not
satisfied with Hurt.

“Connie can do better,” he
said. “She's a dynamic player
inside. She had two consistent
games in a row. Consistency is
the biggest thing with her.

“Its a long season, though.”

NOTES: Delaware's Sharon Wisler
was named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player despite the fact
that Johnson had better scoring
(23.5 to 14.5) and rebounding
(9.5 to 7.5) averages. . . . Johnson

was named to the All-Tournament
team along with McConnell and
Ransom. . . Lisa Fessler and
Tiffany Fingers, the other Lady
Panther freshmen, also saw

action. Fessler came in at shooting »

guard and McElhinny moved to
point guard to give McConnell a
rest at various times in the two
games. . . . Last year, Pitt lost in
the first round of the tournament
to Eastern Kentucky and went on
to beat St. Bonaventure in the
consolation game. . In this
year’s consolation game,
Cleveland State beat Kent State
75-56. . . . Pitt’s next game is at
2 p.m. on Sunday against Virginia
Commonwealth at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

no paperwork.

We also cover preventive services in full. . .like mammo-
grams, periodic physicals, routine ob/gyn check-ups, pediatric
